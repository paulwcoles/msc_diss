SAW THE PANTS OF AN IDEAL MODEL SOCKS
I'LL BE FINDING OUT WHY CAMPAIGNERS ARE GETTING IN A SPIN ABOUT THE FUTURE OF LAUNDRETTES AND IN THE FIRST OF A NEW SERIES OF MEET THE AUTHOR JIM MEETS AN AUTHOR THE OSCAR WINNING IRISH DIRECTOR AND AUTHOR NEIL JORDAN IS THE ONE THING I'D LOVE TO DO IS TO WRITE DIALOGUE
AND I MOST LOVE TO WRITE DIALOGUE THAT DOESN'T SAY WITH THE CHARACTER OF THINKING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY RARELY SAY WHAT THEY THINK THE FOND OF AND THE BEAUTY OF DIALOGUE ACTUALLY THERE IS A LOOSE HAVE A KIND OF A BLEAK IN TODAY'S NEWSREADERS CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RULED OUT AN OVERHAUL OF PENSION TAX RELIEF IN THIS MONTH'S BUDGET THERE HAD BEEN REPORTS THAT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WAS PLANNING TO SCRAP THE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY OLDMAN HAD MADE CLEAR SHE OPPOSED TO CHANGE AND TORY M.P.S WERE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD HAVE PROMPTED A FURIOUS REACTION FROM AFFLUENT VOTERS ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED THE PROPOSALS COULD REDUCE THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME OF HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS BY THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELLEN THE GARNIER REPORTS
THERE HAD BEEN SPECULATION GEORGE OSBORNE WAS PLANNING A HUGE SHAKE UP OF PENSION TAX IN THIS MONTH'S BUDGET UNDER THE CURRENT RULES PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PUT SOME OF THE MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE PAID IN INCOME TAX INTO THEIR PENSIONS INSTEAD ONE SUGGESTION WAS THAT MISTER OSBORNE WAS PLANNING AN ICE A STYLE SYSTEM WHERE TAXES PAID ON CONTRIBUTIONS BUT WITHDRAWALS BECOME TAX FREE
EXPERTS HAD WARNED THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE SABRES AND COULD TRIGGER A CRISIS WITH PEOPLE RUSHING TO WITHDRAW THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS THE PROPOSALS ALSO FACE RESISTANCE AMONG TORY EM PEAS BUT A TREASURY SAUL SAID NOW WAS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE CHANGES TO PENSION TAX RELIEF WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WITH BUSINESS OPPOSED TO FURTHER DISRUPTION OF THEIR SYSTEMS
AND WITH LAST YEAR'S PENSION REFORMS STILL BEDDING IN AN ALLY OF THE CHANCELLOR SAID MISTER OSBORN HAD ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR HE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO DAMAGE SAVING BUT IT'S ALSO A RECOGNITION OF HOW FRAGILE THAT Y. U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS AVOIDING CHANGES TO THEIR PENSION TAX SYSTEM IN THE BUDGET REMOVES THE RISK OF UPSETTING THE ELECTORATE AHEAD OF THE VOTE IN JUNE
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AFTER APPARENTLY VOICING SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FINANCIAL TIMES SAYS THE B. C. C. HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING AFTER JOHN LONGWORTH MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID THE COUNTRY'S LONG TERM PROSPECTS COULD BE BRIGHTER OUTSIDE THE E.U. THE ORGANISATION HAD SAID IT WOULDN'T CAMPAIGN FOR EITHER SIDE MORE DETAILS FROM KAREN HOGG AND
WHEN JOHN LONGWORTH TOOK TO THE STAGE AT THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE ANNUAL MEETING ON THURSDAY HE TOLD MEMBERS THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM WAS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA VOTERS HE SAID FACED A TOUGH CHOICE HOWEVER IT TWISTS ITS COMMENT THAT THE U.K.'S ECONOMIC FUTURE COULD BE BRIGHTER OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT SET THE CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS HE ALSO SAID THE OUTLOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHTER HAD THE U.K. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN A TRULY REFORMED EUROPE WHEN THE MBC CARRIED OUT ITS OWN SURVEY OF MEMBERS' VIEWS LAST MONTH NEARLY TWO THIRDS SAID THEY WERE IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE E.U. FOLLOWING MISTER LONGWORTH SPEECH THE MBC YOU RELEASED A STATEMENT REPEATING THAT IT WOULD NOT CAMPAIGN FOR EITHER SIDE AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM IT SAID THE DIRECTOR GENERAL HAD BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HIS REMARKS REFLECTED HIS PERSONAL ASSESSMENT RATHER THAN THE POSITION OF THE BBC
TURKISH POLICE HAVE USED WATER CANNON AND TEAR GAS TO FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH PROTESTERS OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST NEWSPAPERS A MAN THEY ENTER THE BUILDING IN ISTANBUL LAST NIGHT TO ENFORCE A COURT ORDER ALLOWING THE AUTHORITIES TO TAKE EDITORIAL CONTROL HUNDREDS OF JOURNALISTS AND STAFF JEERED AS RIOT POLICE ENTERED THE BUILDING
MOVE AGAINST THE PAPER WHICH IS LINKED TO AN OPPOSITION CLERIC BASED IN THE UNITED STATES HAS HEIGHTENED CONCERNS ABOUT DETERIORATING PRESS FREEDOMS IN TURKEY A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CALLED THE ACTION TROUBLING THE PAPER'S EDITOR IN CHIEF IS ABDUL HAMED BUILEACH
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN HEAVY FOR LAST THREE FOUR YEARS THAT ANYONE WHO IS SPEAKING AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT POLICIES IS FACING
EITHER COURT CASES OR PYRISM OR SUCH CONTROL BY THE GO
I THINK THIS IS A DARK PERIOD FOR COUNTRY FOR OUR DEMOCRACY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS DARK PERIOD IF YOU CONTINUE
THE CHINESE PREMIER AT YOUNG HAS SIGNALLED THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL SLOW FURTHER THIS YEAR IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT HE SET A GROWTH TARGET OF SIX AND A HALF PER CENT AND SPOKE OF A DIFFICULT BATTLE AHEAD FROM BEIJING HERE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN SOUTHWORTH
CHINA'S NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IS A HIGHLY CHOREOGRAPHED LARGELY RUBBER STAMP AFFAIR BUT THE PREMIERS OPENING ADDRESS CAN AT LEAST BE GLEANED FOR CLUES ABOUT THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF POLICY TWENTY FIFTEEN'S GROWTH RATE WAS SET AT AROUND SEVEN PER CENT BUT THIS YEAR LEE COULD CHANG TOLD THE THREE THOUSAND ALSO BLACK SUITED DELEGATES ARE LOWER LIMIT OF SIX AND A HALF PER CENT WAS POSSIBLE
EVEN THAT THOUGH WILL REQUIRE BIG STIMULUS SPENDING AND MISTER LEE DULY OBLIGED OUTLINING PLANS FOR A MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN ROADS AND RAILWAYS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TAX CUTS FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS THERE WAS PLENTY OF TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO REFORM INEFFICIENT STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES BUT FOR MANY THIS SPEECH WILL LOOK A LOT LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL A COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AT ALL COSTS
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION SAYS GREECE NEEDS URGENT HELP FROM OTHER STATES TOUGHER BORDER CONTROLS THROUGHOUT THE BALKANS MEAN THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LEAVE GREECE TO REACH NORTHERN EUROPE IN RECENT WEEKS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE TODAY PROGRAMME DIMITRI'S SAID IT WAS TIME FOR E.U. STATES TO ACCEPT THEIR FAIR SHARE OF REFUGEES
GREECE IS OVERRUN HE'S OVERWHELMED BY BY ALL THESE FLOWS WHICH AT THE MOMENT BELIES THE WHOLE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT EVER SAID THE BEGINNING WE MUST SEE THIS SITUATION IS A GLOBAL ISSUE ABOUT THAT I WANT
AND YOU CAN HEAR THAT INTERVIEW AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK HEAD TEACHERS HAVE WARNED OF A RISING TIDE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AMONG SCHOOLCHILDREN IN ENGLAND AND WALES WITH AN INCREASE IN SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AMONG PUPILS THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BIRMINGHAM CRITICISE WHAT IT SAID WAS A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN OUTSIDE SCHOOL IS OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS SAID ANXIETY AND STRESS AMONG CHILDREN HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS LEAVING PUPILS WITH A WORRYINGLY HIGH LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IT'S SAID CHILDREN FACED ENORMOUSLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET HAD EXPOSED MANY TO CYBER BULLYING
THE ASSOCIATION SAID HEAD TEACHERS HAD REPORTED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PUPILS HARMING THEMSELVES AND THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE THE HEAD TEACHERS' UNION SAID THE EXTRAORDINARY RANGE OF PRESSURE'S ON CHILDREN WERE MORE THAN MANY COULD BEAR BUT THAT SCHOOLS FOUND IT HARD TO GET EFFECTIVE HELP FROM LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVEST AN EXTRA BILLION POUNDS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE
THEN CARSON WHO WAS HOPING TO BECOME THE FIRST BLACK REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS PULLED OUT OF THE RACE TO WIN THE PARTY'S NOMINATION THE RETIRED BRAIN SURGEON HAD FAILED TO WIN A SINGLE STATE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT GARY O'DONAHUE
IN A CAMPAIGN DOMINATED BY THE IDEA OF THE OUTSIDER THEN CARSTEN LOOKED LIKE BEING A STRONG CONTENDER A SUCCESSFUL PAEDIATRIC SURGEON EVEN HAD A FILM MADE ABOUT IS A MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENT
HE WAS A DARLING OF THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT AND HE'S STRONG EVANGELICAL MESSAGE ENDEARED HIM TO LARGE PARTS OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE
BUT AS THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED HE PROVED WEEK ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND FOUND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN PARTS OF HIS BACKGROUND STORY
HE ALSO APPEARED TO OVERSTEP THE MARK WHEN HE COMPARED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE REFORMS TO SLAVERY BY THE END HE WAS POLLING VERY LOW PERCENTAGES BUT MORE THAN HIS SUPPORT HIS ENDORSEMENT WILL BE SOMETHING OTHER CANDIDATES WILL SEE
PARADISE HERE REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE START WITH A VERY BIG DECISION BY THE CHANCELLOR NOT A U. TURN EXACTLY BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A FORMAL COMMITMENT TO DITCH THEIR PENSION TAX RELIEF SYSTEM BUT NONETHELESS IT HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY CONSIDER CHRIS MASON
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ABANDON FOR WHAT REASON CHRIS I THINK ULTIMATELY JUST IN THE DECISION WAS THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH OF A RISK THEY TAKE IN TOO MUCH HEAT SO THERE WAS CRITICISM FROM CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WHO FELT THAT IT WOULD GO AFTER THEIR CORE VOTES BECAUSE AS THINGS STAND AT THE MOMENT IF YOU ARE A HIGHER RATES OF INCOME TAX PAYER THE NEW BENEFIT TO A GREATER EXTENT BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING YOU NOT PAYING INCOME TAX ON THAT PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IT GOES IN AND BECAUSE YOU PAY A HIGHER RATE BUT IT'S A GRATER
BENEFITS TO YOU THERE WAS A CONCERN FOR ME PENSIONS MINISTER LADY ULTRAMAN ROS ALTMANN WHO WAS A PENSIONS EXPERT WHICH RECRUITED FOR THAT VERY REASON SHE FELT THAT'S NOT ONLY COULD IT PUT PEOPLE OFF SAVING BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE TAXED ON THEIR PENSION ON THE WAY IN IT MIGHT PUT PEOPLE OFF SAVING BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT IN RETIREMENT SHE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO
BLOW IT ALL ON A LAMBORGHINI OR WHATEVER SO SHE FELT IT WOULD CREATE PERVERSE INCENTIVES AND THEN THERE'S THE BIGGER POLITICS IT'S I THINK THE LAW THAT ANY POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTS TALKING TO A PROGRAMME AT THE MOMENT HAS TO REFER TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM IS THE PRISM THROUGH WHICH ALL POLITICS IS LOOKED OUT AT THE MOMENT AND I THINK THERE WAS A NERVOUSNESS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING THAT COULD PROVE VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND COULD PROVE THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THE REFERENDUM AS A WAY OF KICKING THE GOVERNMENT IN A FEW MONTHS
BUT IS THERE ANY SENSE IN WHICH WE COME BACK TO THIS AT SOME STAGE IN THE FUTURE OR GEORGE OSBORNE REVISITS IT OR IS THAT IT THEY SAID THEY WERE HAVING A CONSULTATION LAST SUMMER AND THEY WERE WILLING TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THEY SAID AT THE TIME THEY WERE COMMITTED TO DO ANYTHING ANYTHING AS A RESULT OF SAID CONSULTATION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED YOU WOULDN'T APART FROM THE E.U. REFERENDUM
WHICH OTHER ONES WOULD BE REMOVED IF THEY WERE TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE NOW THEY'RE NOT SAYING ABSOLUTELY DEFINITIVELY THAT IT IS STONE DEAD FOREVER BUT AS I SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE CONCERNS THAT HE RACED AROUND THE INCENTIVES IT CREATES BOTH NOW AND THEN FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN WHO THEN DRAWING DOWN ON THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME IN THE FUTURE YOU WOULDN'T YOU COULD SEE HOW THE SAME CONCERNS WOULD BE RAISED IN FUTURE KRIS WHAT WHAT'S IT DONE TO GEORGE OSBORNE COS YOU THINK OF THE TAX CREDITS
FIASCOS I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER TO CALL IT AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE S. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT A LOT OF EFFORT PUT INTO SUGGESTING TO US THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE REALLY BIG CHANGES THERE NOTHING COMES OF IT WHAT'S WHAT'S IT DONE TO HIM I THINK HE'S VERY CONSCIOUS OF REWINDING A FEW YEARS PRIOR TO THE TAX CREDITS TO THE SO CALLED OMNI SHAMBLES BUDGETS WHICH FOR MONTHS ON END JUST FELL APART BASICALLY HAS ONE POLICY AFTER ANOTHER WAS PICKED APART YOU AND ALL THE CONVERSATIONS
TAX AND KAREN CHURCH STEVE ONLY SURVIVOR PERFECTLY WELL AND HE DID IN THE END ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME THINGS WERE PRETTY ROUGH GOING AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR TO FIND CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AT THE TIME IT WHO WERE JUST NOT HAPPY WITH HIM AT ALL OUR THINGS THERE'S THE WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT BEING BOOED AT THE AT THE OLYMPICS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING SINCE THEN THINGS HAVE LUCKED OUT YES THERE WAS THAT ROUGH TIME FOR HIM AROUND
THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF TAX CREDIT I SUPPOSE POLITICALLY MAKING THIS DECISION NOW EFFECTIVELY ANNOUNCING TEN DAYS BEFORE BUDGET THAT SOMETHING HE WAS TOYING WITH DOING HERE IS NOT GOING TO THE POLITICAL AIM OF THAT IS TO SHUT DOWN ANY FLAK BEFORE HE'S EVEN ANNOUNCED AGUS DE PRE ANNOUNCE YOUR OWN ANNOUNCEMENT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THERE ISN'T A BACKLASH A FEW
CHRIS MASON THANKS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUGEES SAYS THE GREASE HAS BEEN OVERRUN AND OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANTS ONE CORRESPONDENT GAVIN LEE IS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE MACEDONIA AND THERE ARE AN AWFUL AT LEAST THERE HAVE BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF REFUGEES COLLECTING THEY'RE TRYING TO GET INTO MACEDONIA FROM GREECE GAVIN WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT
YEAH THAT'S CONTINUALLY JOHN THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST PLACE TO GET A SNAPSHOT OF THE SCALE OF THE WHOLE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE BIGGEST MUG AND CAMPING IN EUROPE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ESTIMATED TO BE HERE
BETWEEN A MOUNTAIN PASS AND COULD BEAT THE GREEK MACEDONIAN BORDER BETWEEN FOREMOST FEELS ABOUT A SQUARE KILOMETRE WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE AND YOU CAN FOLLOW A TRAIL EVEN THIS MORNING AS THE SUN WAS RISING OF PEOPLE WALKING
ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ARRIVED TO THE CAMERA CAN SEE PEOPLE SETTING UP TENTS NOW THERE'S ONE HUNDREDS OF FIRES BURNING ALL AROUND PEOPLE CHOPPING DOWN TREES AND IN THE IN THE AREA HERE BRING IT AT JUST FOR FOR WARMTH THE CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED SLIGHTLY WAS POURING AND ALL THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST JOHN FOR A SMALL BIT OF RESPITE TO PEOPLE HERE THAT IT'S SUNNY THIS MORNING AND THE OTHER THING THAT IF ANYBODY USE HAVE SEEN THIS PLACE AND TO DESCRIBE TO THOSE THAT THAT HASN'T SEEN THE IMAGES OF IT WHEN YOU FIRST GET HERE LOOKS LIKE IT'S OF A VERY MISERABLE SUMMER FESTIVAL SITE THAT'S BECAUSE THE AID AGENCIES HAVE BEEN GIVING WHAT THEY HAVE TWO MAN TENTS FLIMSY SUMMER TENDS TO THOSE WHO ARRIVED WITH NOTHING OR BLANKETS AS WELL SLEEPING BAGS MAINLY SYRIANS IRAQIS IN THIS CAMP AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE COLOURFUL TENSE ALL AROUND THESE THESE FARMERS' FIELDS
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS GETTING THROUGH ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH TO THE MACEDONIA BORDER YESTERDAY IN OVER THERE NICE ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TOLD BECAUSE OF THESE LIMITS IN THE BALKANS IS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED BUT THERE'S NO REAL GUESSING JOHN IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER THAT ARE IN A FORMULA IT SEEMS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER ABLE TO GO THROUGH EACH DAY THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE BACKING UP MASSIVELY THEY ARE STILL ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS AND THEY GO TO ATHENS AND THEN THEY MOVE NORTH
YEAH IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT I SEE THERE RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE A LONG LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN THE THE MOUNTAIN HEADING TOWARDS THIS CAN BE HAVE BEEN COMING HERE DID TO ALMOST A FORMAT NOW THEY'VE SET UP THE PRETENCE IT'S A SPRAWLING SITE THERE SOME DRONE FOOTAGE THAT WAS TAKEN A FEW DAYS AGO UP IN THE AIR OF THE WHOLE CAMP AND ACTUALLY IF YOU CAME BACK AND DID IT AGAIN IT'S ALMOST A THIRD AS BIG AGAIN IT KEEPS GROWING EVERY DAY THE OTHER THING THAT'S CHANGED FOR ME JOHN I'VE COVERED THE MIGRATION CRISIS ALL OVER EUROPE OVER OF THE PAST YEAR
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY CHILDREN FORTY PER CENT OF THIS CAMP ARE UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE FACTORS IS THIS WHAT THEY CALL THE SECOND WAVE I WAS SPEAKING TO A SYRIAN FAMILY THREE TEENAGE GIRLS AND THEIR MOTHER FROM ALEPPO THERE FOR THE GIRL'S FATHER HAD GONE TO STUTTGART SEVEN MONTHS AGO AND THEY SAID IN A DAY AND A NUMBER OF OTHER WOMEN FROM THE FROM THE AIR THIS VILLAGE CLOSE TO A LEPER WERE DOING THE SAME THING AND BREED A BRIEF POINT IS THAT ALSO BRINGS ABOUT A VULNERABILITY AND THE AID AGENCIES LIKE MEDICINE SOME FRONT HERE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP WALKING AROUND SOME OF THESE
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE O.K. A LOT OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GOING MISSING WE WERE TOLD THE SEVERAL HUNDRED MISSING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS IF YOU CLEAR WORRY OF ABDUCTION TO THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS CAMP BUT I'VE EXPERIENCED BEFORE
INDEED DESPERATELY WORRYING GAVIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT THE TIME QUARTER PAST SEVEN IF YOU HAVE A RELATIVE IN A CARE HOME SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA YOU WILL KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY AND THE STAFF OF THE HOME FACE A REPORT FROM THE ORGANISATION MARIE CURIE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL DEMENTIA SUGGESTS THAT THEIR HOMES NEED MORE HELP DOCTOR SAMPSON IS FROM THE EIGHT PALLIATIVE CARE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON AND HIS CO AUTHOR IN THE RECESSION IS HERE COME ON INTI GOOD MORN WOULD'VE BEEN FINE
WE FOUND THAT DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS CARE HOME STAFF ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO LOOK AFTER FRAIL ELDERLY PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAD CHRONIC PAIN PRESSURE SORES DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING VERY COMPLEX NEEDS I THINK IT'S VERY EASY TO CRITICISE CARE HOMES AND STAFF THAT WORK IN THEM BUT ACTUALLY WE FOUND THAT THEY WERE MUCH HIGHER LEVEL PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF POLICY THE HEALTH SYSTEM AND HOW WE ARRANGE A COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES SO
CARE HOMES TEND TO BE VERY ISOLATED WITHIN THEIR LOCAL CARE HOME SYSTEM WITH NOT MANY PROFESSIONALS FUNDED TO GO IN THERE WHAT GOOD SO THEY'RE JUST NOT GETTING VISITS FROM DOCTORS AS OFTEN AS WELL I THINK IT'S VERY PATCHY AND IT'S VERY VARIABLE SO
MANY CARE HOMES ARE VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY LOCAL G.P.S AND VERY AND JERRY TRADITIONS BUT THAT DEPENDS UPON LOCAL HEALTH CARE COMMISSIONING STRUCTURES AND SOME CARE HOMES AND THEIR RESIDENTS HAVE VERY LITTLE SUPPORT FROM LOCAL G.P.S AND LOCAL DOCTORS AND IT REALLY LEAVES A STAFF IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND THE IMPACT HUGE PRESUMABLY IT'S HIS STAFF AND OF COURSE ON THE PENSION WELL IT'S A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED DEMENTIA WHO ARE REACHING THE END OF THEIR LIVES
ON THEIR FAMILIES BUT I THINK ALSO ON THE STAFF AS WELL WHO JUST WANT TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO THEM ALL BEING AND BEING ALLOWED TO GO UNTREATED A RELATIVELY UNTREATED THAT THERE COULD BE PICKED UP THIS PIECE OF WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IS THERE MUCH IT'S IT'S A SMALL PART OF A MUCH BIGGER PIECE OF WORK WORK FUNDED BY MARIE CURIE AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THIS PROJECT WE'VE FOUND
ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY ADVANCED DEMENTIA OFTEN HAVE POORLY CONTROLLED PAIN THEY MAY DEVELOP DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING THEY MAY HAVE PRESSURE SORES THEY CAN GET VERY AGITATED AND DISTRESSED TOWARDS THE END OF LIFE AND WE FOUND THAT IN SOME CARE HOMES AND THESE SYMPTOMS WERE CHRONIC AND GOING ON FOR OVER SIX MONTHS WITHOUT ANYONE REALLY BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM PROPERLY AND PRESUMABLY THEN THE RISK
THAT THEY GO WHEN THEY CAN'T COPE IN THE CARE HOME THAT THIS PERSON AND GO STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL WHICH OF COURSE FOR OTHER BROADER REASON WE WANT TO AVOID QUITE APART FROM THAT THEY'RE THE UPSET FOR THE PERSON CONCERNED ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SIGN THIS PAPER IS THAT STRUCTURE AND POLICY CHANGES WHICH INCREASE HEALTH CARE INPUT INTO CARE HOMES MAY SEEM EXPENSIVE BUT ACTUALLY THEY MAY SAVE MONEY DOWN THE LINE IT MAY TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF THE KEEP HOSPITALS IF LESS OTHERS REACH IS GOING ON ABOUT SO MANY THINGS
IN AND AROUND THE HEALTH SERVICE DEAD AYE IS THERE A SET OF THINGS THAT A RENT RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE AND CAN BE DONE RELATIVELY QUICKLY THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE WELL ANOTHER THING THAT CAME OUT REALLY STRONGLY WAS THAT THERE WAS NO ONE PERSON OVERSEEING THE CARE OF PEOPLE WITH THESE COMPLEX NEEDS THEY SOMETIMES THEY HAVE SOME FOR FROM HER G.P. SOMETIMES WERE GERIATRICIAN AND WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT DEVELOPING THE ROLE OF CARE COORDINATORS FOR PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED DEMENTIA AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO
IN PILOT STUDIES BE QUITE SUCCESSFUL SO SOMEONE WHO TAKES AN OVERVIEW OF THE PERSON WITH DEMENTIA THE SYMPTOMS THEY'RE HAVING THEIR NEED TO THEIR FAMILY AND STAFF SO THAT WILL BE SOMEONE IN THE CARE HOME I'M IN THE CARE HOME OR COMING IN THEY'RE COMING INTO THE CARE HOME FROM OUTSIDE SOMETIMES WE FEEL THAT CARE HOMES OFTEN FEEL THEY NEED MORE SUPPORT FROM OUTSIDE AND IT CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL PUTTING A NURSE SPECIALIST OR A DOCTOR INTO THE CARE HOME FROM SERVICES OUTSIDE DOCTOR LE SAMSON FOR MATT MARIE CURIE PALLIATIVE CARE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON THANKS VERY MUCH
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN M.P.S DEBATED FOOTBALL YESTERDAY THE POWER OF FANS TO IMPROVE THE GAME TO BE PRECISE WHY HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT MARK DARCY
FAR FROM COMING HOME IS FOOTBALL NOW LEAVING HOME IS THE PREMIERSHIP WORLD OF MANICURED PLAYERS AND BILLIONAIRE OWNERS NOW DANGEROUSLY DETACHED FROM THE ORDINARY FANS AND IF IT IS WOOD GIVING FANS THE RIGHT TO BUY SHARES IN THE CLUB AND HAVE REPRESENTATION ON THE CLUB BOARD WE CONNECT IT
THAT'S THE PLAN FLOATED BY THE LABOUR M.P. CLIVE EFFORT IN A PRIVATE MEMBER'S BILL IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY HE SAID T. V. REVENUE HAD MADE PREMIERSHIP CLUBS INTO MEGA BUSINESSES AND THEIR OWNERS OFTEN INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS ARE INCREASINGLY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE CREATED THOSE CLUBS THESE PEOPLE ARE SWEEPING IN ON THEIR PRIVATE JETS LOOKING TO BUY THESE FOOTBALL CLUBS AND THEY ARE NOT LOOKING BACK AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUSTAINED THOSE FOOTBALL CLUBS THROUGH GENERATIONS
THE PREMIER LEAGUE WAS NEGOTIATING A NEW SIX BILLION POUND T. V. DEAL WITH THOSE SORTS OF SUMS OF MONEY FLOATING AROUND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
THAT WE DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF JUST WHAT EXACTLY CREATED THOSE FOOTBALL CLUBS IN THE FIRST PLACE OR WHY THEY EXIST TODAY WHICH IS THE COMMUNITIES AND THE FANS THAT COME FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WOULD BUY
IT WAS THE FANS WHO ANCHORED THE CLUBS IN THEIR TRADITIONS HE SAID VAN REPRESENTATION MIGHT NOT BE A PERFECT DEFENCE BUT IT COULD HELP PREVENT CLUBS FROM LOSING THEIR ROOTS HE WAS SUPPORTED BY HIS LABOUR COLLEAGUES STEPHEN POUND YOU SAID THE NEW BREED OF INTERNATIONAL OWNERS WE'RE NOT THE REAL OWNERS OF THE CLUBS
YOU MAY HAVE THE SHARES YOU MAY HAVE THE KEYS TO THE BOARDROOM YOU MAY HAVE AN EXECUTIVE CAR PARK BUT THEN IT'S NOT OWNING A FOOTBALL CLUB THE OWNERSHIP OF A FOOTBALL CLUB IS IN THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITY AND OF THE VAN SO THIS IS WHY MY HORRIBLE FRAME FOR ELTON'S BUILT IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
FOOTBALL IS NOT A FAD A FOOTBALL CLUB IS NOT SOMETHING YOU PICK UP AND YOU PUT DOWN A FOOTBALL CLUB IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE A FEATURE OF A LOCAL AREA IT IS A PART OF THE COMMUNITY IT IS THE LIVING BREATHING REALITY OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY
HE SAID THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED TO GIVE FANS A VOICE SADLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ORGANIC IT IS NOT GOING TO FALL AS THE GENTLE RAIN FROM HEAVEN WE'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME LEGISLATION WHICH IS WHY THE RIGHT TO BUY AND I NEVER THOUGHT THAT
AS AN HONEST SOCIALIST WOULD ACTUALLY BE PLEADING FOR THE RIGHT TO BUY BUT I DO IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE ONLY THE RIGHT TO BUY SHARES AND MANDATORY PLACEMENT
ON THE BOARD IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GO AHEAD BUT OTHER M.P.S WERE UNCONVINCED THE CONSERVATIVE JAMES MORRIS SAID HE SYMPATHISED WITH THE BILL BUT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF RUNNING FOOTBALL CLUBS NEED TO ENSURE
THAT THEY FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE FOOTBALL CLUBS
WHICH IT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE TO LABOUR'S CONOR MCGINN INTERRUPTED TO SAY FOOTBALL FANS GOT A WORSE DEAL THAN SANDS OF OTHER SPORTS
WHEN I GO TO WATCH OTHER SPORTS LIKE RUGBY LEAGUE IN SAINT HELENS OR GAELIC FOOTBALL AND ROSE LET THEN WEST LONDON EPEE
A LITTLE AMOUNT FOR A TECH GET THE PEOPLE WHO GO IN THOSE GAMES ARE JUST AS PASSIONATE AS FOOTBALL FANS WHO HAD SEEMS TO ME PAY AN INORDINATE AMOUNT SO WHEN THE GENTLEMAN THE GENTLEMAN SAYS THERE ARE NO WANT HANNAH'S WE MUST FIND ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE IT'S IMPERATIVE AND IMPORTANT THIS ESTATE IN A NATIONAL AND THE BILL WAS FINALLY KILLED OFF BY THE CULTURE MINISTER DAVID EVAN HAD
THE GOVERNMENT ON FORTY OR NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE ARE OPPOSING IT BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATION IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD IN DEALING MATTERS LIKE THIS AND TO ACHIEVE
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE F.A. ARE EMBARKING ON A REVIEW OF ITS GOVERNANCE AND WE HOPE THERE WILL BE GENUINE PROGRESS INCLUDING MADAME DEPUTY SPEAKER GIVING SUPPORTERS GREATER REPRESENTATION ON HIS DECISION MAKING BOARDS SECONDS LATER THE WHISTLE SOUNDED AND DEBATING TIME RAN OUT THE BILL WILL BE ON THE COMMONS AGENDA FOR NEXT FRIDAY BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF FURTHER DEBATE STILL LESS BECOMING
THAT WAS MARK DARCY HIM OR HER NURSE EVENTS YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT TEN TO NINE ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO AS WELL TIME NOT TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN CHINA IS AIMING TO BECOME A WORLD LEADER IN ADVANCED INDUSTRY SEMICONDUCTORS ROBOTICS AVIATION EQUIPMENT SATELLITES AND YET AT THE SAME TIME IT'S PLANNING TO CUT DOWN ON INTERNET FREEDOM FOR ITS OWN CITIZENS HOW LONG CAN THE CHINESE
LIVE WITH THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THEIR EFFORT TO MODERNISE AND YET AT THE SAME TIME TO STAY THE SAME CAN THEY KEEP THEIR ECONOMY FROM CRASHING LIKE THE STOCK MARKET IN BEIJING NEARLY THREE THOUSAND DELEGATES ARE GATHERING FOR CHINA'S NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ITS ANNUAL TEN DAY SESSION AND OUR WORLD AFFAIRS EDITOR JOHN SIMPSON IS THERE TOO AND HAS BEEN REFLECTING ON THE STATE OF CHINA TODAY
ALL RUN ME IS THE VAST EXPANSE OF TIANANMEN SQUARE AT THE HEART OF BEIJING IT'S A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY TODAY BUT YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS HERE THE SMOG WAS AWFUL AND THE POLLUTION LEVEL WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX WHEN FIFTY IS THE TOP LEVEL FOR SAFETY THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS THE NEAREST THING CHINA HAS TO A PARLIAMENT IS GATHERING OVER THERE I HAD THE GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE
SECURITY IS TIGHT AND TEAMS OF FIREMEN ARE STANDING STIFFLY TO ATTENTION EVERYWHERE WITH THEIR GEAR JUST IN CASE ANYONE TRIES TO SPOIL THE OCCASION BY SETTING FIRE TO THEMSELVES
THREE YEARS AGO THIS MONTH SHE GIN PING A BIG AFFABLE SEEMING CHARACTER WITH A GLAMOROUS SHOWBIZ WIFE TOOK OVER AS PRESIDENT THE COUNTRY WAS BECOMING MUCH MORE OPEN MIGHTY WONDERED TURN INTO CHINA'S MIKHAIL GORBACHEV FREEING IT FROM ITS MARXIST LENINIST SHACKLES
WELL NOW WE KNOW THIS LAST WEEK FOR RICHARD BOOKSELLERS FROM HONG KONG APPEARED ON CHINESE TELEVISION CONFESSING GROVELLING LEAD TO A VARIETY OF CRIMES THERE DARED TO STOCK BOOKS ABOUT PRESIDENT SHE IS LOVE LIFE IT ISN'T A CRIME IN HONG KONG BUT THEY'D BEEN DISAPPEARED FOR FOUR MONTHS
BRITAIN MUMBLED A COMPLAINT BUT IN THE NEW SPIRIT OF CHINESE BRITISH FRIENDSHIP WAS PRETTY MUTED SO PRESIDENT SHE GIN PING IS NO GORBACHEV SOMETHING HE'S GETTING A BIT TOO MAOIST PUBLIC CONFESSIONS TAKE US RIGHT BACK TO THE BAD OLD DAYS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING WELL IF YOUR ECONOMY IS GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN THERE'S A RISK OF A HARD LANDING YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE PENALTIES FOR PUBLIC DISORDER
I USED TO KNOW ONE OF PRESIDENT SHE'S FIERCEST POLITICAL ENEMY AS BOTH SHE LIE VERY ANGLOPHILE IN HIS SADDLE ROSE SUITS YOU WON'T BE WEARING THOSE NOW BECAUSE HE'S IN JAIL THEM THEY'VE THROWN AWAY THE KEY
HE ONCE SAID TO ME YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW INSECURE OR A GOVERNMENT FEELS WHEN IT KNOWS IT HASN'T BEEN ELECTED
PRESIDENT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO FEEL INSECURE HE'S GOT HUGE PUBLIC SUPPORT AND THE CHINESE ARE JUSTIFIABLY PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THE STATE SYSTEM CERTAINLY SEEMS HYPER SENSITIVE
THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS HERE IN THE SQUARE SOMEONE LET OFF FOR FIRECRACKERS OVER THERE AT THE GATE OF HEAVENLY PEACE WHERE MUG SAID TONES HUGE MOONLIGHT PORTRAIT STILL HANG
BIG DEAL YOU MIGHT THINK HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THE WEST BUT HERE IT'S LIKE A CHALLENGE TO THE ENTIRE AUTHORITY OF THE SYSTEM SECURITY MEN LIKE UNDERTAKERS IN BLACK SUITS AND WHITE GLOVES CAME RUSHING OVER TO STOP US FILMING WHILE THE POLICE DROVE OFF WITH THE OFFENDERS
CHINA IS RICH AND SUCCESSFUL AND I WILL PERSONALLY ADD DELIGHTFUL I LOVE IT POLLUTION AT ALL YET IF I HAD TO FIND A SINGLE ADJECTIVE TO DESCRIBE IT TODAY I'D REFER BACK TO POOR OLD BLOW SHE LIES A MOULDERING IN HIS PRISON CELL AND QUOTE THE WORD HE USED INSECURE

CAR LEASE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FINISH OH WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF IT FROM YOU BUT THE LINE IS IT WAS IT WAS BAD AND US AND US GOT WORSE POLICE TO SET REPORTING FOR US THEY'RE LIVE IN DAMASCUS
THAT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS BOTH THE MAIL AND THE EXPRESS ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH IMMIGRATION THE MAIL'S FRONT PAGE HEADLINE SURRENDER ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS IT SAYS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ENTERING BRITAIN REFUSED TO DISCLOSE WHERE THEY COME FROM AND THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T BE EXTRADITED SOME MIGRANTS EVEN BURN THEIR PASSPORTS SO THEIR REAL IDENTITIES CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED THE EXPRESS LOOKS AT THE SITUATION ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT ASYLUM
CLAIMS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE PAST YEAR REACHING MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION APPLICATIONS IN THE U.K. WENT UP BY A FIFTH WITH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE BEING MADE EACH DAY ACCORDING TO FIGURES FROM THE USE DATA AGENCY HERE A STACK THE TIMES AS THE SAME STORY IN QUOTES MIGRATION WATCH YOU SAYING THAT IT'S VITAL FOR THE E.U. TO GET A GRIP ON THE RELATIVE NUMBERS OF THOSE CLAIMING ASYLUM OF THOSE WHO ARE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS
IF THE UNION FAILS TO DO THAT THE GROUP BELIEVES THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS WILL SNOWBALL A THEM SUCKERS AS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN SUGGEST THAT FEWER THAN A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE E.U. ARE SYRIANS ICH SKATE ESCAPING CONFLICT THERE'S CONCERN ACCORDING TO THE PAPER THAT MANY OF THE REFUGEES ARE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS TRICKING OFFICIALS HAS A LARGE AERIAL PHOTO OF THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA WITH TWO THICK COS A RAZOR WIRE STRETCHING INTO THE DISTANCE THE SUN DESCRIBES IT AS A NEW IRON CURTAIN ACROSS EUROPE
THERE'S AN ENTRY IN THE TELEGRAPH WITH THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WILTING GIRL HE SAYS DAVID CAMERON'S UNDER PRESSURE THE PUBLISHED FIGURES WHICH REVEAL THE TRUE NUMBER OF EUROPEAN UNION MIGRANTS LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY MUST WITHIN DALE IS IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. HAS TOLD PAPER PUBLIC SERVICES ARE CREAKING AND BRITAIN CANNOT GO ON HAVING AN ENORMOUS INFLUX OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL
THE INDEPENDENT RESPONSE TO GEORGE OSBORNE'S REPORTED DECISION NOT TO SCRAP TAX RELIEF ON PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS WITH AN EDITORIAL COMMENT HEADLINED UNFAIR JEWS THE PAPER BELIEVES A CHANCER IS UNLIKELY TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE MAN WHO SOLVED BRITAIN'S PENSION PROBLEM THEY DON'T USE THAT WITH ANY YOUNGER WORKERS FACING MEAGRE RETIREMENT INCOMES MISTER OSBORNE NEEDS TO TACKLE WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS AN APPALLING INTER GENERATIONAL UNFAIRNESS BUT APPROACHING THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DUNBLANE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ON THE MIRROR INTERVIEWED RON TAYLOR WHO WAS HEADMASTER OF THE SCHOOL
WHERE IT ALL HAPPENED HE'D TOLD THE MIRROR HE'S ALWAYS FELT ENORMOUS GUILT ABOUT THE ATTACK IN WHICH SIXTEEN PUPILS AND ONE TEACHER WERE MURDERED BY THOMAS HAMILTON THE MIRROR PRAISES MY TAILOR'S BRAVERY SAYS THAT WITH MANY STILL SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE ATROCITY HIS STORY NEEDS TO BE HEARD

OF WHAT FLOURISHES IN THIS CLIMATE TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW TODAY WE ARE LAUNCHING A NEW REGULAR SATURDAY SLOT
MEET THE AUTHOR WE ARE CALLING IT AND JIM IS GOING TO BE MEETING AUTHORS SO TO KICK OFF THE SERIES HERE HE IS WITH NEIL JORDAN THE OSCAR WINNING IRISH DIRECTOR KNOWS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS GROUNDBREAKING FILMS THE CRYING GAME THE COMPANY OF WOLVES BUT WHO HAS JUST PUBLISHED HIS NEW NOT
I'M GOING TO ADD ME
NEIL JORDAN IS A STORY TELLER EQUALLY AT HOME ON THE CINEMA SCREEN AND THE PAGES OF A NOVEL IT'S FILLER THE DROWNED DETECTIVE HAS ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF A MOVIE A FAST MOVING PLOT CAST OF DARK AND INTRIGUING CHARACTERS ARE SETTING THAT DISTURBED TO YOU FROM THE VERY FIRST
ALL THAT AND A STRONG WHIFF OF THE SURREAL YOU REALISE IN THIS STORY THAT YOU'RE IN THE HANDS OF A MASTER OF DIET
WELCOME WHEN YOU'RE WRITING FICTION OR PUTTING A STORY ON THE PAGE DO YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF
BEING BEHIND A CAMERA IS THAT HOW YOU SEE WHERE YOU KIND OF HAVE TO SEE US YOU KNOW IN A WAY AND IT'S IN A STRANGE WAY IT'S VERY LONELY PURSUIT WRITING A NOVEL YOU KNOW BUT IN A STRANGE WAY YOU CAN BE AS A ON THE SET WITH THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE AROUND YOU AND TO DIRECT A MOVIE CORRECTLY OR TO SEE IT CORRECTLY YOU KIND OF HAVE TO
PLACE YOURSELF IN A VERY SOLIPSISTIC ISOLATED POSITION IN A WAY OTHER WAS YOUR INFLUENCE BY EVERYBODY IN THE MOVIE BECOMES NO GOOD SO THE LONELINESS OF THE WRITER IS VIEW ESSENTIAL REALLY THAT'S WELL IT'S ALSO ACCENTUATED BY THE
POSITION OF THE DIRECTOR YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING IS STRANGE
TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS MINISTRY ROAMING ABOUT WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE SO YOU'RE FAR BETTER OFF TO KEEP YOURSELF IN AN ISOLATED PLACE THEM TO KEEP YOU
YOUR BRAIN CLEARING TO SEE THINGS AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE AND IN A SENSE YOU HAVE THAT MAGIC EYE BUT THAT'S OMNISCIENT I MEAN YOU CAN MOVE AROUND THE ROOM YOU SEE THE ROOM YOU SEE THIS STREET DO YOU SEE THE BRIDGE WHERE ONE POINT IN THE STORY A GIRL
APPARENTLY GOING TO JUMP INTO THE RIVER FROM ALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU SEE IT THERE OH I SEE THAT'S WHY I STARTED MAKING MOVIES IN THE END BECAUSE I WAS WRITING FICTION IN IRELAND AND I STARTED WITH A BOOK A STORY A NOVEL CALLED THE PAST WHICH WAS ENTIRELY BASED WITH A PHOTOGRAPHER I REALISED EVERYTHING I WAS WRITING WAS BASICALLY TO DO WITH VISUAL DESCRIPTION IN THE WAY SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE DESCRIBED NOVELS AS VERY IMMATURE
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A SLIGHT CRITICISM YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE IN A WAY THEY SHOULDN'T BE A MAJESTIC BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF BEING I AM I SUPPOSE AND THERE'S NO POINT RESISTING WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IMAGES
WRITING NOVELS IS ABOUT HAVING AN
SPEECH ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A WEIRD THING AS KIND OF A KNACK REALLY THAT THIS IS THE ONE THING I'M MOST LOVED TO DO WAS TO WRITE DIALOGUE
AND I MOST LOVE TO WRITE DIALOGUE THAT DOESN'T SAY WITH THE CHARACTER OF THINKING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY RARELY SAY WHAT THEY THINK
YOU KNOW THE REVEAL THEMSELVES UNWITTINGLY YEAH AND IT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING UM EVEN WHEN I'M GOING THROUGH A SCREENPLAY SOMETIMES HAVE PEOPLE SAYS ALL I DON'T THINK I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY WIFE OR SOMETHING THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU SAY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TOO MUCH YOU IT'S KIND OF THE FOND OF AND THE BEAUTY OF DIALOGUE ACTUALLY THERE IS A LOOSE HAVE A KIND OF A BLEAK IN SAYING WHAT YOU FEEL IS IN A WAY UNREALISTIC
MY POINT TO THE SOONER I REALLY UP THE WAY WE ENTIRE OF FICTION WORK IS AN AVOIDANCE OF SAYING WHAT YOU ACTUALLY EITHER WAY WELL TALKING ABOUT IT THE REALISM OF THE STORY OF THE OTHER THE REALISTIC SETTING OF THE STORY IT'S IT'S A VERY GRITTY SETTING SOMEWHERE IN EASTERN EUROPE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
IT'S A WORLD THAT WE RECOGNISE WITH IT WAS SECRET POLICEMAN WAS CORRUPT PEOPLE WITH PUSSY RIOT TYPE DEMONSTRATORS IT'S A WORLD THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH
BUT IT'S A VERY DESPAIRING WORLD
THERE'S NO ONE THERE WAS MUCH HOPE NOT AND THE ENVIRONMENT OUR CENTRE OF POOR JONATHAN FINDS HIMSELF
I MEAN I WROTE THIS BOOK IN A WAY I HAD NO POLITICAL AXE TO GRIND HER AND I WASN'T SPEAKING ABOUT ANY REALISTIC PLACE THEY'D SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND HUNGRY DOING SERIOUS CALL THE BOYS SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND VARIOUS PLACES BUCHAREST AND DIFFERENT PLACES IN EASTERN EUROPE YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S JUST ONE REFLECTIVE MOOD IN A STRANGE WAY WHICH IS WHY I MADE IT SPECIFIC
IT'S A MOOD OF A KIND OF AN ORDER OR A WORLD CRUMBLING I MEAN I SUPPOSE IN EUROPE AT THE MOMENT YOU DO FEEL THAT
WHATEVER STRUCTURES ARE HOLDING THE SOCIETAL AGREEMENT TOGETHER COLLAPSING BY THE MOMENT AT YOUR CENTRAL CHARACTER JONATHAN WHO'S AN ABSORBING CHARACTER IS SOMEBODY WHO
CAN'T PUT HIS OWN LIFE TOGETHER SO HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO IS HE'S REALLY LOST IN THIS WORLD THAT UNFOLDS AROUND THERE WHICH IS
HE'S VIOLENT MYSTERIOUS AND DIFFICULT DO YOU WANT TO GIVE GIVE US SOMEBODY
WE WOULD HOPE SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT SPRING THERE IS HOPE THERE IS HOPE I MEAN IT'S A PORTRAIT OF A MARRIAGE AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT DO YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER TWENTY YEARS AND HAVE A CHILD
THIS MYSTERIOUS THING HE'S VANISHED FROM THEIR LIVES IN WHICH HOLDS PEOPLE TOGETHER I THINK IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENS IN EVERY PERSON'S AROUND THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE OR YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS IN EVERY MARRIAGE IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP AND EVERY HUMAN BEING WERE WHATEVER IS THAT SAP OF URGENCY SEEMS TO
GONE TO SOMEBODY ELSE OR SOMETHING TO THAT WITH ME THIS STRIKES ME AS A STORY THAT
COULD WORK ON THE SCREEN AS IT'S THERE I MEAN IS IT GOING TO WELL I MEAN IT IT'S I ALWAYS LOVE THAT NICK NICHOLAS ROEG WHERE THEY DON'T LOOK NOW
RATHER SIMILAR TO HAUNTING MOVIE ON SOME OF THAT ENDS UP IN A SIMILAR TERRAIN OF IRRATIONAL AND STUFF AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOVIE OF THIS BOOK AMAZON HAVE A FILM STUDIO AND THEY HAVE BOUGHT IT ABOUT TALKING TO THEM SO PERHAPS I'VE NEVER MADE A MOVIE OF THE BOOK I'VE WRITTEN TODAY THAT I MIGHT MAKE ONE OF THIS
IT WAS NEIL JORDAN TALKING TO JIM IF YOU WANNA WATCH WATCH MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW CAN FIND ON THE B.B.C. I PLAYER TIME NOW IS WHAT IS IT SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE WERE TALKING TO LEASE TWO SETTEES IN THE SYRIAN CAPITAL DAMASCUS JUST SEGMENT TO BEFORE THE LINE WENT DOWN SHE'S BACK
AT LEAST YOU WERE DESCRIBING SCENES OF WELL NOT EXACTLY NORMALITY BUT CERTAINLY PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THERE'S MUCH LESS FIGHTING AND GOING OUT THE OBVIOUS QUESTION THAT ARISES FROM THAT IS WHAT NOW WHAT NOW AND THERE ARE ELECTIONS PLANNED ON THERE BY PRESIDENT ASAD FOR NEXT MONTH TO THOSE GO AHEAD IS IT DOESN'T IT DOES THIS OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS TO BE MADE WHAT HAPPENS NOW DO YOU
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THEORY AND ARE TAKING IT DE I.T. ALMOST OUR EYE A WORD NOT EVEN ALLOWING THEM
BUT YOU HAVE SEVENTEEN OUTSIDE PLAYERS ON
WAS YOU KNOW A LIFE UNDERGROUND HE DIDN'T FORGET
MEET A BEER BREACHING A BIT FIERY WHAT'S THAT TELEPHONE CALL BETWEEN BLOODY KNEW
I'LL CALL NUMBER OF WORLD LEADERS TO KEEP IT'S GOING TO BE
LONG KENNY CONTINUE FOR THE MOMENT IT'S HOLDING ALL THE GET UP
I'M OF PROGRESS WE HAD HAD THE LAST LONGER OR PREPARE TO BE ANYTHING
SOMETHING MORE SIGNIFICANT AND IN THAT PERIOD WHILE THERE IS THIS CESSATION MESS THIS ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT SLIGHTLY MORE NORMAL LIVES AND THEY WERE BEFORE IS IS THERE ALSO THE CHANCE OF BUILDING THE KIND OF STRUCTURES AND IN A HUMANITARIAN SENSE GETTING AID TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THAT WASN'T THERE A WEEK OR SO AGO THAT ONE
WORK LONG INTO THE NIGHT
COWS EAT
IT LITERALLY THEIR DURING THIS TRUCE WHICH BEGAN ON FEBRUARY THE TWENTY SEVEN THAT IS WALKING
YEP TO RUSSIA THING BIG EGO THROUGH MAKE SURE OUR CONVOY CAN WEAR CROP FEET THEY DON'T ATTACK THE CONVOY SO YES THERE IS THE SENSE THAT
PROPERTY WHY DID HAPPEN ALIEN PEOPLE WENT DESPERATE NEED OF EGYPT THE BIKINI BUT ALL THAT YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SAY IN THE MASCOTS THANKS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A SOUTHAMPTON STUDIO THIS MORNING BRIAN DRAPER OF THE LONDON INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITY GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING I WRITER DAILY THOUGHT FOR LENT IN WHICH HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING MY READERS VERY SIMPLY TO TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO PAUSE AND BREATHE DURING THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES THE OTHER DAY THOUGH I RECEIVED AN EXASPERATED NOTE FROM ONE OF THEM A SENIOR TEACHER IN A SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL WHO DIDN'T FEEL SHE HAD A SPARE MOMENT TO CALL HER OWN DURING AN EXHAUSTING DAY IT DID MAKE ME THINK IT'S ALL VERY WELL TALKING ABOUT THE SPIRITUALITY OF PAUSING BUT OUT IN THE REAL WORLD IT CAN FEEL VERY DIFFERENT
HER EXPERIENCE SEEMS TO RESONATE WITH A WRITTEN REPORT PUBLISHED THIS WEEK FROM POLICY EXCHANGE I THINK TANK WHICH ARGUES THAT SCHOOLS NEED TO EMBRACE MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING TO STOP IN ITS WORDS THE SHOCKING WASTE OF TALENT THAT SEES WOMEN IN PARTICULAR LEAVING TEACHING
IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD I THINK FOR PEOPLE SERVING ANY GREAT CAUSE AS TEACHERS DO TO GIVE OR RECEIVE PERMISSION EVEN TO TAKE A BREAK BUT IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER WHAT KIND OF WORLD OF WORK WE'RE MODELLING TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS TO SCHOOLCHILDREN IF WE CAN'T FIND WAYS OURSELVES TO FLOURISH AS WE GO
SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD TWO I WAS WORKING WITH YOUNG LEADERS LAST WEEK WILL BE THE FUTURE OF A GLOBAL CONSULTANCY WHICH HELPS OTHER ORGANISATIONS TO PERFORM BETTER AND ONE PERSON CONFESS THEY'VE BEEN GETTING THREE TO FIVE HOURS OF SLEEP A NIGHT FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS AND WONDERED WHEN AND IF THIS BREATHLESS PACE WAS EVER GOING TO END IF SOMEONE LIKE THEM DOESN'T DARE TO PAUSE THEN I WONDER WHO WELL
WHERE ARE THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY WHO DON'T EXPECT TO BURN THEMSELVES OUT ANY MORE IN THIS SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY OF A WORLD WE ARE ALL TOO BUSY CREATING AND WHERE OTHER SPIRITUAL LEADERS FOR THAT MATTER WHO AREN'T WORKING EVERY HOUR GOD SENDS THEM EITHER
I KNOW OF TOO MANY WHO ARE MODELLING IN THEIR ORGANISATIONS OR CHURCHES AN UNSUSTAINABLE WAY OF WORKING THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON EVERYONE TO FOLLOW SUIT TO LOOK BUSY OR ELSE I'M AFRAID I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM HOME FOR FIVE WEEKENDS RUNNING PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF
HALFWAY THROUGH MY MIND RETURNS TO JESUS OUT THERE FOR FORTY PAINFULLY SLOW DAYS IN THE DESERT BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS PUBLIC WORK IT'S A COURAGEOUS LEADER WHO DARES TO STOP AS WELL AS GO LEARNED FROM ME HE SAID THE UNFORCED RHYTHMS OF GRACE
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR HIM OF COURSE HE DIDN'T HAVE A SMARTPHONE FOR A START OR THE BOSS FROM HELL BUT WHOEVER AND WHEREVER WE ARE TODAY ISN'T THEIR TIME IF WE LOOK WITH CARE TO PERMIT EACH OTHER JUST THE SHORTEST SPACE TO PAUSE AND BRIE AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BRIAN DRAPER ASSOCIATE LECTURER AT THE LONDON INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITY TIMES TEN TO EIGHT
SCARCELY A WEEK SEEMS TO GO BY THESE DAYS WITHOUT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE REPORTING YET ANOTHER CANCER BREAKTHROUGH AT LEAST HOLDING OUT THE PROSPECT THAT WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF FINDING THE CURE AND IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO POUR COLD WATER ON IT EVERYONE IT WAS CANCERS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US AND ALWAYS WILL BE AFTER ALL THERE ARE SO MANY FORMS OF IT AND YET WHY SHOULD BE REGARDED AS INVINCIBLE VARIOUS AMERICAN PRESIDENTS INCLUDING OBAMA PROMISED IT WILL BE BEATEN HERE'S RICHARD NIXON IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE I WANT ASSHOLE ARSE
APPROPRIATION OF AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED MILLION
YOU CAMPAIGN TO FIND A CURE FOR CANCER THE TIME HAS COME IN A MAN
IN THE SAME KIND OF CONCENTRATED
THAT'S RUGBY
TOP MAN BUT
SHOULD BE TURNED TOWARD CONQUERING THIS DREAD DISEASE
THAT WAS RICHARD NEXT I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY PAM KEARNS WAS PROFESSOR OF PAEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY AND HEREBY PROFESSOR RUDGE CH OPRAH HEAD OF CANCER THERAPEUTICS AT THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH AND ROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL AND PROFESSOR TROOPER YOU HEAR THE PHRASE A CURE FOR CANCER IS IT CREDIBLE
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE'RE AN ERA OF GREAT HOPE THERE IS OPTIMISM
BUT THE TERM CURE IS A VERY SUBJECTIVE THING IT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE IF TO ME
THE CONCEPT OF SURVIVING LONG TERM WITH GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE AND HAVING A MEANINGFUL LIFE IS REALLY THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF DEALING WITH AND WE ARE GETTING THERE I THINK WE ARE GETTING THERE FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES SO SO MUCH SO THAT PATIENTS WHO HAD
NO HOPE OF SURVIVAL AND NOW LIVING LONG TERM WITH FULFILLING LIVES WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS AND THAT TO ME IS A GREAT STRIDE BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO DO BUT IS IT TRUE THAT THE NEXT REALLY BIG BREAKTHROUGH IS IN THE FIELD OF IMMUNOLOGY THAT IS TO SAY
TELL ME IF I WIN I GET THIS WRONG TEACHING GETTING GOOD CELLS TO BE ABLE TO SEEK OUT AND KILL THE BAD CELLS SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY EVOLVED IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FIGHT FOREIGN ORGANISMS AND INCLUDING CELLS THAT GO WRONG WITHIN THE BODY AND THAT
HE'S EVOLVED OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS SO WE HAVE AN IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO KILL AN ATTACK CANCER CELLS THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT CANCER CELLS THEMSELVES HAVE EVOLVED
OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS WHICH EVADE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY IS THAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THE ON AND OFF SWITCHES IN IMMUNE CELLS AND THAT WAS ENABLED US TO EXPLOIT
WES AND MET PATHWAYS TO DEVELOP NEW DRUGS SUCH THAT CERTAIN DISEASES OR CANCERS SUCH AS MELANOMA WHICH WERE INCURABLE ARE NOW BECOMING GIVING A LOT OF HOPE SO MUCH SO THAT UP TO THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF PATIENTS SURVIVING LONG TERM RIGHT PROFESSOR KERN'S YOU'D USE THE WORD HOPE AS WELL IN THIS CONTEXT I ABSOLUTELY I THINK IF YOU LOOK BACK TO ANYWHERE FORTY YEARS AGO AND THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY PATIENTS
SCUSE ME PATIENTS BEING CURED FROM CANCER RATES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AROUND ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TODAY WERE A SITUATION WHERE THEY HALF OF PATIENTS CAN BE CURED AND CARE ADVISEDLY THE DISEASE HAS GONE THE LIVING NORMAL LIVES
CANCER RESEARCH U.K. INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO RESEARCH TO TRY AND AIM THAT WITHIN TWENTY YEARS WILL HAVE AROUND THREE OUT OF FOUR PATIENTS BEING CURED OF CANCER BUT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE SIMPLE PANACEA THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ANSWER THAT THE ONE
SIMPLE THING THAT CURES ALL CANCERS AS YOU QUITE RIGHTLY SAID THAT IS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT DISEASES DIFFERENT DISEASES THAT HAPPEN AND CHILDREN COMPARED TO ADULTS AND WE NEED TO TACKLE IT BY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO DIAGNOSING CANCER
EARLY AND WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF CURING PATIENTS THEY'RE DIAGNOSED AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE IN THEIR DISEASE AND THAT CAN BE TACKLED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS BOTH BY IMPROVING THE RATE OF THE PATHWAY THROUGH FROM DIAGNOSIS THROUGH TO TREATMENT BUT ALSO RESEARCHING TO DETECTING CANCER EARLY FINDING WAYS A SCREENING FOR CANCER FOR EXAMPLE THE COLA RECTAL CANCER SCREENING PROGRAMME
HAS ALLOWED A LOT MORE PATIENTS TO BE DIAGNOSED A MUCH EARLIER STAGE IN THEIR DISEASE AND WHERE CARE CAN BE OFFERED BY CONVENTIONAL SURGERY AND CHEMOTHERAPY SIR AVAILABLE TODAY ARE WE PROFESSOR TROOPER ANY CLOSER TO
BEING ABLE TO STOP IT HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE I MEAN I KNOW WE CAN'T VACCINATED KEN'S CANCER BUT I MEAN A WEEK CUT HER MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IS THAT POSSIBLE EVER FACT EVEN MENTIONED THE WORD VACCINATION
WE ARE NOW UNDERSTANDING THE PROTEINS THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN DETECT IN CANCER
IN FACT A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE COME OUT DEFINING THESE SO CALLED ANTIGENS PROTEINS
SPECIFIC TO THE TUMOUR AND VACCINATION PROGRAMMES HAVE ALREADY STARTED REALLY HISTORICALLY WITH ACTUALLY UNDERTAKEN VACCINATIONS BUT THAT HAS BEEN BASED ON BROAD POPULATION STUDIES WHAT WE'RE NOW ABLE TO DO IS ACTUALLY DETECT
HIS PROTEIN SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PATIENTS THEN DEVISED VACCINES SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PATIENT AND FACT NOT ONLY CAN WE THINK OF VACCINES BUT WE CAN USE CELLULAR THERAPIES TAKING EITHER THE PATIENT'S OWN CELLS ALL IMMUNE CELLS FROM A DONOR OH OFF THE SHELF AND ENGINEER THEM TO
ATTACK THE CANCER SO THEY ARE UNDERSTANDING THESE BUILDING BLOCKS OF CANCER AND HOW THE CANCER HIJACKS THESE BUILDING BLOCKS IN THE CELL IT REALLY IS ENABLING US COME UP WITH NEW THERAPIES EARLY DETECTION IS HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTION AND OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE EARLIER AND WHAT SORT OF TROUSERS ARE YOU DOING PROFESSOR KERN'S
WE DO IN THE CANCER RESEARCH U.K. CLINKER TRIALS UNIT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM AND WE DECLARE COULD TRIALS FROM DRUG DEVELOPMENT TRIALS WHERE YOU'RE TAKING NEW INNOVATION INTO THE CLINIC FOR THE FIRST TIME AND CHECKING THAT IT'S SAFE AND THE RIGHT DOSE TO TAKE FORWARD RIGHT THROUGH TO LARGE FACE THREE TRIALS AND BY THAT I MEAN TRIALS WHERE WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER THE TREATMENT IS BETTER THAN THE CURRENT STANDARD WHETHER THAT IS A CURRENT STANDARD CHEMOTHERAPY OF A WAY OF GIVING RADIOTHERAPY AND ADDING NOVEL NEW
NEW DRUGS TO TWO TWO THAT THOSE TREATMENTS AND EXCITING THEY WERE MOVING INTO AN AREA OF PRECISION MEDICINE WHERE WE'RE DOING TRIALS WHERE
WE'RE SCREENING PATIENT TO SEE IF THEY THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR MOLECULAR TARGET IN THEIR CANCER AND MATCHING THAT TO A DRUG THAT IS DEVELOPED TO ATTACK THAT PARTICULAR TARGET AND THIS IS I THINK A WHOLE NEW WAY OF DOING CLINICAL TRIALS ARE RATHER THAN PUTTING PATIENTS IN
WITH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CANCER FOR EXAMPLE LUNG CANCER OR PANCREATIC CANCER FOR A PARTICULAR TYPE OF DRUG NOW WE CAN SAY WITHIN WITHIN FOR EXAMPLE LUNG CANCER DOES THAT LUNG CANCER EXPRESS A CERTAIN MOLECULAR PROFILE THAT MAKE IT MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO A PARTICULAR TARGETING RUG SO WE ARE
STRETCHY FIND THE PATIENTS THE DRUGS THEY GET A MORE PRECISE FOR THE CANCER THAT THEY HAVE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU BOTH HAVE THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT PETER GIBBS WITH THE WEATHER THIS MORNING THANKS JUST GOOD MORNING MORE WINTER THE SPRING THIS WEEKEND REALLY NORTHERLY WINDS KEEP IN THE COLD WEATHER IN PLACE WHISK OF ICE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS WHERE THINGS HAVE BEEN DAMP OVERNIGHT ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES WELL FOR PARTICULARLY FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND WILL QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD OUTBREAKS OF
SLEET AND SNOW A BIT OF RAIN AROUND THE COAST BUT COULD GIVE A FURTHER COVERING OVER SOME HIGHER GROUND IN TERMS OF SNOW BUT THE REST OF ENGLAND ALONG WITH WALES I THINK ANY EARLY SHOWERS TENDING TO MOSTLY DIE AWAY MAJORITY OF THE TIME DRY A FEW SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH BUT A COLD DAY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES SIX TO NINE DEGREES AT BEST AND ACTUALLY ACROSS SOME EASTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND IN A BRISK NORTH EASTERLY WIND NO HIGHER THAN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX
ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND EASTERN SCOTLAND I THINK THEY WILL GET MOST OF THE SNOW AND IT WILL BE MAINLY THROUGH THIS MORNING IT WILL TEND TO EASE OFF THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON OTHERWISE WELL A FAIR BIT OF A DRY AND TIMES BRIGHT WEATHER JUST THE ODD SHOWER DRIFTING THROUGH BUT HERE TO A COLD DAY HIGHS OF FOUR TO SEVEN DEGREES AND THEN TONIGHT'S A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FROST AGAIN WATCH OUT FOR SOME ICY PATCHES WHERE THINGS STAY DAMP TOMORROW GEOFFREY STAYS CHILLY BUT LARGELY DRY JUST A FEW SHOWERS PERHAPS FOR SOME NORTH SEA COASTS OF ENGLAND
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PETER TONIGHT JOE QUEEN AND HE'S ENCOURAGING ENCOURAGING YOU TO BREAK THE RULES DISOBEDIENCE
TO A DAY OFF
THIS WEEK'S ARCHIVE ON FOUR EXPLORES OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REBELLION
KEEP OFF THE GRASS
MAKES ME WONDER WHY I SHOULD STAY OFF THE GRASS AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO GO ON THE GRASS PRESENTED BY THE WRITER AND SATIRIST QUEEN
YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHAT DISOBEDIENT BUT SHE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO BE DISOBEDIENT OR THERE WILL BE ANY GROUSE
A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISOBEDIENCE THIS EVENING AT EIGHT AND THEN AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
IN THE NEXT HOUR WE WILL TALK TO THE E.U. COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION WHO TELLS US THAT GREECE HAS BEEN OVERRUN AND OVERWHELMED BY MIGRANTS WE WILL ALSO BE HEARING ABOUT LAUNDERETTES THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM LEFT THIS IS TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE FIFTH OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS DROPPED PLANS TO END TAX RELIEF ON PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS THE HEAD OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR SAYING THE U.K. IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TURKISH POLICE HAVE STORMED THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST NEWSPAPERS WHERE THE AUTHORITIES ARE TAKING EDITORIAL CONTROL TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS ORGAN
THE GOVERNMENT HAS RULED OUT AN OVERHAUL OF PENSION TAX RELIEF IN THIS MONTH'S BUDGET THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WAS PLANNING TO SCRAP THE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY OLDMAN HAD MADE CLEAR SHE OPPOSED TO CHANGE AND TORY M.P.S WERE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD HAVE PROMPTED A FURIOUS REACTION FROM AFFLUENT VOTERS ANALYSTS SAY THE PROPOSALS WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE RETIREMENT INCOME OF HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS BY THOUSANDS OF POUNDS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELLEN THE GARNIER REPORTS
THERE HAD BEEN SPECULATION GEORGE OSBORNE WAS PLANNING A HUGE SHAKE UP OF PENSION TAX IN THIS MONTH'S BUDGET UNDER THE CURRENT RULES PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PUT SOME OF THE MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE PAID IN INCOME TAX INTO THEIR PENSIONS INSTEAD ONE SUGGESTION WAS THAT MISTER OSBORNE WAS PLANNING AN ICE A STYLE SYSTEM WHERE TAXES PAID ON CONTRIBUTIONS BUT WITHDRAWALS BECOME TAX FREE
EXPERTS HAD WARNED THIS WOULD DISCOURAGE SABRES AND COULD TRIGGER A CRISIS WITH PEOPLE RUSHING TO WITHDRAW THEIR RETIREMENT FUNDS THE PROPOSALS ALSO FACE RESISTANCE AMONG TORY EM PEAS BUT A TREASURY SAW SAID NOW WAS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE CHANGES TO PENSION TAX RELIEF WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WITH BUSINESS OPPOSED TO FURTHER DISRUPTION OF THEIR SYSTEMS
AND WITH LAST YEAR'S PENSION REFORMS STILL BEDDING IN AN ALLY OF THE CHANCELLOR SAID MISTER OSBORN HAD ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR HE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO DAMAGE SAVING BUT IT'S ALSO A RECOGNITION OF HOW FRAGILE THAT Y. U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS AVOIDING CHANGES TO THEIR PENSION TAX SYSTEM IN THE BUDGET REMOVES THE RISK OF UPSETTING THE ELECTORATE AHEAD OF THE VOTE IN JUNE
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AFTER APPARENTLY VOICING SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS TO BE C. C. HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING AFTER JOHN LONGWORTH MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID THE COUNTRY'S LONG TERM PROSPECTS COULD BE BRIGHTER OUTSIDE THE E.U. THE ORGANISATION HAD SAID IT WOULDN'T CAMPAIGN FOR EITHER SIDE OR DETAILS FROM KAREN HOGG
WHEN JOHN LONGWORTH TOOK TO THE STAGE AT THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE ANNUAL MEETING ON THURSDAY HE TOLD MEMBERS THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM WAS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA VOTERS HE SAID FACED A TOUGH CHOICE HOWEVER IT TWISTS ITS COMMENT THAT THE U.K.'S ECONOMIC FUTURE COULD BE BRIGHTER OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT SET THE CAT AMONG THE PIGEONS HE ALSO SAID THE OUTLOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHTER HAD THE U.K. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN A TRULY REFORMED EUROPE WHEN THE MBC CARRIED OUT ITS OWN SURVEY OF MEMBERS' VIEWS LAST MONTH NEARLY TWO THIRDS SAID THEY WERE IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE Y. YOU FOLLOWING MISTER LONGWORTH SPEECH THE MBC YOU RELEASED A STATEMENT REPEATING THAT IT WOULD NOT CAMPAIGN FOR EITHER SIDE AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM IT SAID THE DIRECTOR GENERAL HAD BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT HIS REMARKS REFLECTED HIS PERSONAL ASSESSMENT RATHER THAN THE POSITION OF THE BBC
TURKISH POLICE HAVE USED WATER CANNON AND TEAR GAS TO FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH PROTESTERS OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST NEWSPAPERS THEY ENTER THE BUILDING IN ISTANBUL LAST NIGHT TO ENFORCE A COURT ORDER ALLOWING THE AUTHORITIES TO TAKE EDITORIAL CONTROL HUNDREDS OF JOURNALISTS AND STARVE JEERED AS RIOT POLICE ENTERED THE BILL
MOVE AGAINST THE PAPER WHICH IS LINKED TO AN OPPOSITION CLERIC BASED IN THE UNITED STATES HAS HEIGHTENED CONCERNS ABOUT DETERIORATING PRESS FREEDOMS IN TURKEY A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CALLED THE ACTION TROUBLING THE PAPER'S EDITOR IN CHIEF IS ABDUL HAMED BUILEACH
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN HEAVY FOR A LAST THREE FOUR YEARS THAT ANYONE WHO IS SPEAKING AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT POLICIES IS FACING
EITHER COURT CASES OR PYRISM OR SUCH CONTROL BY THE GO
I THINK THIS IS A DARK PERIOD FOR COUNTRY FOR OUR DEMOCRACY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS DARK PERIOD IF YOU CONTINUE
THE CHINESE PREMIER LEAGUE HAD HUNG HAS SIGNALLED THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL SLOW FURTHER THIS YEAR IN HIS ANNUAL ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT HE SET A GROWTH TARGET OF SIX AND A HALF PER CENT AND SPOKE OF A DIFFICULT BATTLE AHEAD FROM BEIJING HE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN SOUTHWORTH
CHINA'S NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IS A HIGHLY CHOREOGRAPHED LARGELY RUBBER STAMP AFFAIR BUT THE PREMIERS OPENING ADDRESS CAN AT LEAST BE GLEANED FOR CLUES ABOUT THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF POLICY TWENTY FIFTEEN'S GROWTH RATE WAS SET AT AROUND SEVEN PER CENT BUT THIS YEAR LEE COULD CHANG TOLD THE THREE THOUSAND OR SO BLACK SUITED DELEGATES ARE LOWER LIMIT OF SIX AND A HALF PER CENT WAS POSSIBLE
EVEN THAT THOUGH WILL REQUIRE BIG STIMULUS SPENDING AND MISTER LEE DULY OBLIGED OUTLINING PLANS FOR A MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN ROADS AND RAILWAYS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TAX CUTS FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS THERE WAS PLENTY OF TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO REFORM INEFFICIENT STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES BUT FOR MANY THIS SPEECH WILL LOOK A LOT LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL A COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AT ALL COSTS
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION SAYS GREECE HAS BEEN OVERRUN AND OVERWHELMED BY REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS DMITRI SEVERAL MOP LOSS HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THE WHOLE OF THE E.U. NOW HAD TO MOBILISE MOBILISE TO DEAL WITH THE CRISIS MORE DETAILS FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHNNY DIAMOND
GREECE SAID THE COMMISSIONER IS UNDER PRESSURE AND ON THE GROUND IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMED AND OVER RUN BY FLOWS OF MIGRANTS THOUSANDS ARE STILL ARRIVING ON GREEK SHORES EVERY DAY EVEN IN THESE BITTER WINTER MONTHS AROUND THE E.U. THERE'S BEEN MUCH CRITICISM OF GREECE'S RESPONSE MY AVRAM EN PLUS GREEK HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT HAD TAKEN SOME TIME FOR GREECE TO ORGANISE ITS RECEPTION FACILITIES BUT HE SAID THAT IT HAD STEPPED UP IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS
GREECE HE INSISTED MUST NOT BE ALONE A RIPOSTE PERHAPS TO THOSE WHO TALK OF CUTTING THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE SAYING AND FREE MOVEMENT ZONE EVERYONE HE SAID MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE TO OPEN OUR DOORS HE SAID THEY ARE REFUGEES
REPORTS FROM SYRIA'S SAVE A TRUCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND REBEL FORCES IS BROADLY HOLDING A WEEK AFTER IT CAME INTO FORCE THERE WERE SOME AIR STRIKES YESTERDAY IN THE CAPITAL DAMASCUS BUT ELSEWHERE AID AGENCIES CONTINUE TO DELIVER SUPPLIES REPORTING FROM DAMASCUS A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT THESE TO SET
THIS TRUCE ISN'T PERFECT VIOLATIONS ARE BEEN REPORTED BUT IN LARGE PARTS OF SYRIA IT'S LARGELY HOARDING AND YOU CAN FEEL IT IN GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED CENTRAL DAMASCUS YESTERDAY THE PARKS WERE FULL OF FAMILIES PICNICKING IN THE WARM SPRING SUNSHINE AND IN MANY REBEL HELD AREAS SYRIANS TOOK TO THE STREETS FOR THE KIND OF PEACEFUL FRIDAY PROTESTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF AIR STRIKES AND SHELLING
AID AGENCIES ALSO WORKED LONG INTO THE NIGHT DELIVERING ASSISTANCE TO THREE TOWNS IN REBEL HANDS WHICH HAD BEEN CUT OFF BY GOVERNMENT FORCES FOR NOW THERE'S A REAL AND PALPABLE SENSE OF RELIEF BUT AFTER NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF FIGHTING MANY SYRIANS STILL DON'T DARE TO BELIEVE THIS LULL WILL LAST
HEAD TEACHERS HAVE WARNED OF A RISING TIDE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AMONG SCHOOLCHILDREN IN ENGLAND AND WALES WITH AN INCREASE IN SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AMONG PUPILS ASSOCIATION SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN BIRMINGHAM CRITICISE WHAT IT SAID WAS A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN OUTSIDE SCHOOL HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS SAID ANXIETY AND STRESS AMONG CHILDREN HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS LEAVING PUPILS WITH A WORRYINGLY HIGH LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IT'S HER CHILDREN FACED ENORMOUSLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS HAD ACCESS TO THE INTERNET HAD EXPOSED MANY TO CYBER BULLYING THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVEST AN EXTRA BILLION POUNDS IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE BY TWENTY TWENTY
BEN CARSON WHO WAS HOPING TO BECOME THE FIRST BLACK REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS PULLED OUT OF THE RACE TO WIN THE PARTY'S NOMINATION RETIRED BRAIN SURGEON HAD FAILED TO WIN A SINGLE STATE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES SAINT CAUCUSES REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON GARY O'DONAHUE
IN A CAMPAIGN DOMINATED BY THE IDEA OF THE OUTSIDER THEN CARSTEN LOOKED LIKE BEING A STRONG CONTENDER A SUCCESSFUL PAEDIATRIC SURGEON EVEN HAD A FILM MADE ABOUT IS A MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
HE WAS A DARLING OF THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT AND HIS STRONG EVANGELICAL MESSAGE ENDEARED HIM TO LARGE PARTS OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE
BUT AS THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED HE PROVED WEEK ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND FOUND IT HARD TO EXPLAIN PARTS OF HIS BACKGROUND STORY
HE ALSO APPEARED TO OVERSTEP THE MARK WHEN HE COMPARED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE REFORMS TO SLAVERY BY THE END HE WAS POLLING VERY LOW PERCENTAGES BUT MORE THAN HIS SUPPORT HIS ENDORSEMENT WILL BE SOMETHING OTHER CANDIDATES WILL SEE
THE NOVELIST AND SCREENWRITER PAT CONROY A LEADING FIGURE IN THE LITERATURE OF AMERICA'S SOUTHERN STATES HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY HE ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH THAT HE HAD PANCREATIC CANCER IS BEST KNOWN FOR THE PRINCE OF TIDES IN THE GREAT SANTINI WHICH DEAL WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY LIFE AND WE WERE BOTH MADE INTO SUCCESSFUL FILMS
THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THERE WERE TWO PLANS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CHANCELLOR FOR THE FUTURE OF PENSIONS THE MOST RADICAL WAS A PENSIONS ICE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU'VE GOT NO TAX RELIEF ON WHAT YOU PUT IN BUT YOU PAID NO TAX WHEN YOU TOOK THE SAVINGS OUT
THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG SHORT TERM TAX REVENUE BOOST OF COURSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT LESS RADICAL WOULD'VE BEEN CHANGES THAT SIMPLY REDUCED PENSION TAX RELIEF FOR BETTER OFF PEOPLE THE MOMENT OF COURSE THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE THE MORE YOU BENEFIT BECAUSE YOU GET THE TAX RELIEF AT THE TOP RATE OF TAX THAT YOU PAY SO THOSE WERE THE OPTIONS
TODAY WE ARE BEING TOLD IN AN UNUSUAL PIECE OF PRE BUDGET BRIEFING THAT THEY ARE BOTH OFF THE TABLE NO CHANGE IN PENSION RULES AFTER ALL MARK GARNIER IS ON THE LINE CONSERVATIVE M.P. MEMBER OF THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE WHO'S TALKED TO US ABOUT THESE THINGS IN RECENT WEEKS AND MICK MACK TEAR HIS HAIR IS DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION CENTRE
A CAMPAIGNING ORGANISATION AND UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO SAT ON THE BOARD FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MICK MACHT IT FIRST OF ALL YOU DISAPPOINT
VERY DISAPPOINTED I'M AN INTERESTINGLY JOSS AND I THINK THAT THE PLANTER CAP FOR TAX RELIEF AND ACTUALLY REDISTRIBUTED INCOME TO LAW AND COMPOSERS WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY RADICAL PLAN I THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT WAS THE MORE RADICAL OPTION THE FACT THE REASON WHY A SAILOR'S BECAUSE VERY SIMPLE THERE'S AROUND THE U.K. HOUSEHOLDS HAVE AROUND FOUR POINT EIGHT TRILLION POUNDS WORTH OF PRIVATE PENSION
NO THE TOP TWENTY PERCENT OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ALL AROUND THREE POINT FOUR TRILLION POUNDS OF HER PENSION WEALTH THEY THINK ABOUT THAT SO IF YOU HAD TEN PEOPLE IN A ROOM TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MORE THAN TWICE THE PRIVATE PENSION WELL OFF THAN THE OTHER EIGHT
PUT TOGETHER SO WE HAVE A CLEAR INEQUALITY IN OUR PENSION SYSTEM AND THIS IS A REALLY REALLY DISAPPOINTING PIECE OF NEWS BECAUSE THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT PENSION SYSTEM WORK BETTER FOR THE SELF EMPLOYED PEOPLE ON ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS HERE REALLY FACING A LONG TERM PENSIONS CRATERS I MEAN FEWER AND FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE OF THE SELF EMPLOYED ARE CURRENTLY CONTRIBUTE
PENSION AT THE MOMENT THAT STOVE MY FIGURE OF SIXTY PER CENT BACK IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES IT IS SIMPLY UNFAIR ISN'T IT MARK ON HERE THAT THE WEALTHIER YOU ARE THE MORE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDISES YOUR PENSION WELL THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT YOU THAT IF YOU HAVE A DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS OF THIS IT MASSIVELY FAVOURS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE EARNING MORE MONEY IF YOU TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP OF THE TOP TEN PER CENT OF WAGE EARNERS WHO EARN MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR LUKE THEY HAVE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS
AND IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE TO THE EXCHEQUER TAX RELIEF IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR POINT ONE BILLION AGAINST TAX TAKE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE RETIRED HAVE ABOUT ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION BUT NONETHELESS IT IS THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOP END ARE OBVIOUSLY SHOULDERING THE BURDEN OF THE TAX REVENUE THEY ARE PAYING THE GREATER AMOUNT ATTACKED FOR THAT IN THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT THEY CAN CALL THEIR OWN BUT I DO AGREE VERY MUCH WITH MICK I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A
VERY VERY FUNDAMENTAL REHASH OF THE TENSION THE SYSTEM AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE PROBLEMS LIE MIX IDENTIFIED IT WHILE YOU'VE GOT LOWER WORKERS YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE AND ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTRACTS YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO PAY NO TAX AT ALL YOU GET NO TAX RELIEF BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU'RE AT TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD FOR YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT SAVING FOR YOUR PENSION USE IS TOO FAR AWAY YOU'RE YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO PUT MONEY ASIDE FOR YOUR MORTGAGE AND I THINK THAT A
A REHASH OF THE PENSIONS SYSTEM FOR THOSE PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE THEN WHAT I THINK WHAT WE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE A SYSTEM WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE BIG TICKET ITEMS IN YOUR LIFE SO IF A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD HAS STUDENT DEBT IS TRYING TO PUT SOMEONE INSIDE FOR A MORTGAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE EXPECTING THEM TO PUT AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN AS EARLY AS THEY CAN INTO A PENSION I THINK THE THAT A MAJOR REFORM WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THIS WHOLE IDEA OF LIFETIME SAVINGS A LIFETIME COMMITMENTS AND THEIR MORTGAGES ARE SAVING SCHEME AS WELL AS A WAY OF PURCHASING A HOUSE
AND I THINK A CLEVER CHANCELLOR WOULD BE LOOKING TO FOR A REFORM THAT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY COME INTO EFFECT WILL BENEFIT THOSE PEOPLE UNTIL LONG AFTER HE HAD DIED IT MATTER YEAH I FED US SUGGESTION BEFORE WHERE WE CAN FIND MIXED MORTGAGES AND PENSION SAVINGS AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY QUITE DANGEROUS IDEA BUT OTHERS WILL CAUSE OR PREDICATE AT THE IDEA OF THE SORT OF PEOPLE YOU PROPERTY PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AND THE GROWTH AND PROBABLY WEALTH OFTEN WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSTRIP THEIR EARNINGS OR SOMETHING OR GUARANTEE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN LOOK AT
WE HAVE A WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE U.K. WHAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET ON THE PROPERTY LADDER YOU DON'T SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS ARE CREATING ANOTHER PENSION CRISIS BELLOWING PEOPLE HEAR THEM A PENSION SAVINGS TO PAY FOR AN APPOINTMENT SHOW IT WE NEED IT WE NEED TO FIX BOTH CREDITORS NOT LESSEN THE SIMPLE THING TO DO AND I THINK MARK I NEED TO SORRY ENTER THAT YOU DO YOU CAN SORT OF SEE THE LOGIC IN THIS THE SIMPLE THING TO HAVE DONE WOULD BE TO HAVE ADOPTED ONE OF THOSE TWO PLANS WHICH WAS SIMPLY TO SAY OF PENSION TAX WERE KEITH THERE WILL BE ONE
AMOUNT OF PENSION TAX RELIEF BUT ONE PERCENTAGE THAT EVERYONE GETS AND THAT WOULD BE FAIRER AND THE CHANCELLOR BY NOT DOING THAT HE'S WELL HE'S HE'S HE'S MISSED SOMETHING BIGGER
HE MIGHT HAVE DONE I MEAN I THINK THERE WAS A CONSULTATION IS GOING ON IT'S A LITTLE SLIGHTLY STRANGE HOW THE STORY HAS HAS IF YOU LIKE ESCALATED A BIT IT WAS HE WAS LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND DECIDED THAT THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT BUT IF I CAN WHEN HE SAID HE WAS OPEN TO RADICAL CHANGE THAT SUMMER DIDN'T HE HE DID MAKE IT CLEAR FROM HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WILLING TO LOOK AT THIS
BUT I THINK RADICAL CHANGE DOESN'T NECESSARILY COME TO KIND OF BEEN A COUPLE OF SEASONS I THINK BUT I DO AGREE I DID DON'T WANT A SORT OF CRUNCH AT THIS POINT I'D I ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY SEE THE PROBLEM BUT IF YOU ARE A ZERO RATE TAXPAYERS SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WAS A RATE TAXPAYERS NOW THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE NOT GETTING ANY BENEFIT TO PUTTING ONE IN THE PENSION AND THE AND THE TAX FREE SO THE PENSIONS
SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD IS ACTUALLY YOU PAY YOU A PENSION CONTRIBUTION OUT OF TAXED INCOME BUT THEN THE GOVERNMENT MAKES A TOP UP AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTING AS MUCH AS A FIFTY FIFTY TOP UP IN WHICH CASE EVERYBODY'S BETTER OFF INCLUDING THE FORTY FIVE P. TAXPAYERS SO THERE ARE LOTS OF VARIATIONS ON A THEME AND I THINK IT'S WHERE WHERE YOU START GETTING INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THIS THAT YOU HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS ACROSS TO THE EXCHEQUER
THE FACT THAT IF YOU DO THIS YOU ARE TRANSFERRING TAX REVENUE FROM THE FUTURE TO NOW WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DO YOU WILL BE FUNDING MAY LOOK AT IT BUT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY SIMPLE NOT NOTHING'S EVER SLIP ON PENSIONS OF COURSE BUT RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO TO KEEP THE TAX COST NEUTRAL BUT ACTUALLY SPREAD THE TAX MORE FAIRLY AROUND SO IT'S A LAW IN COMMON SELF EMPLOYED MUSTN'T SORT OF DELICATE AND YOU HAVE KEPT THEIR SPENDING THE SAME BUT YOU COULD HAVE TOPPED
THE PENSIONS OF SELF EMPLOYED AND I WAS BUT A THOUSAND YEAR WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD AS A PENSION TOP UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW AND COMPOSERS CAN I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO BETTER PENSIONS AS A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITY I'M AFRAID ANNA MISSED OPPORTUNITY MARK GARNIER POTENTIALLY BECAUSE THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH THAT THEM THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BROUGHT ON ITSELF IS NOW REALLY LEADING AND A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT
TO AN OPPORTUNITY BEING MISSED TO BE RADICAL TO DO SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE REALLY BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT THAT HAVING TWO BIG THINGS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP I'LL BE ARGUMENTS OF EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER DO YOU THINK THIS IS A VICTIM OF THE REFERENCE I TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T MEAN THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING TO ME OR CHATTING ABOUT IN THE TEA ROOMS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS I THINK I THINK IF THE TRUTH BE KNOWN IT'S MORE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE JUDGING THIS CONSULTATION A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE COME FORWARD AND SAID LOOK ACTUALLY DID THIS TYPE OF FLAT RATE CONTRIBUTION IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO ADMINISTER
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PAYROLLS AND HOW YOU DELIVER IT IT'S CLEARLY NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A GREATER A COMPLAINT AMONG SMALLER BUSINESSES WE'VE GOT WATER AND ROMAN THAT'S CAUSING NO IT'S MORE A BUSINESS THAT IF YOU THEN ADD ON TO IT A PAYROLL ISSUE THAT IT BECOMES A BIT MORE ALL RIGHT WHAT ARE WE TO THAT'S WAY TOO MANY ISSUES FOR US TO GO INTO THIS FUNNY MUG ON HERE AND MAKE MAGGOTY THANKS BOUQUET MUCH EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT
THE FRONT BILLY ARE VERY FAMILIAR SOUND OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST LOVED AIRCRAFT THE SPITFIRE EIGHTY YEARS TO THE DAY IT IS SINCE HIS FIRST TEST FLIGHT JOHN REMAIN IS ONE OF THOSE WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THEM OWNER OF THE AIRCRAFT RESTORATION COMPANY MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU RESTORED ONE YOURSELF WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO BE FLYING TODAY I THINK IN SOUTHAMPTON
YES WE HAVE AN AIRCRAFT WHICH WE STORED AT DUXFORD A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND HE LEFT TWO DAYS AGO FROM DUXFORD TO PUT POSITIONING TO SOUTHAMPTON AND IT WILL BE DOING A FLY BY THERE TODAY
RIGHT LOOK WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT OF COURSE IT WON THE WAR WE ALL KNOW ABOUT APART FROM THAT WHAT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE SPITFIRE THAT MAKES IT SO WE LOVED WAS THE WORD I USED A MINUTE AGO AND HE'S CURIOUS ISN'T IT THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS BIT
YEAH IT IS IT'S VERY MUCH LOVED AND I THINK THAT CAME FROM THE FACT THAT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH GLAMORISED DURING THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN AND CERTAINLY AFTER THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
IT'S A LOVELY SHAPE IT'S A LOVELY SOUND IT JUST LOOKS RIGHT DOESN'T IT I THINK IT REALLY APPEALED TO THE PUBLIC AND THEY TOOK IT TO THEIR HEARTS I THINK YOU WERE THAT IF YOU ASK A CHILD TO DRAW AN AEROPLANE EVEN NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SECOND THEY'LL DRAW THE SPITFIRE
OR THE SHAPE OF THE SPITFIRE YEAH THEY WELL WE SEE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE COME THROUGH DUXFORD HUNDREDS OF THEM DURING THE YEAR AND OF COURSE THAT BATTLE OF BRITAIN'S BACK ON THE CURRICULUM FOR THE CHILDREN NOW AND SO YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY WILL SIT AND DRAW SPITFIRES QUITE HAPPILY
WHAT IS IT THE SHAPE OF THE WING PERHAPS IS THAT THE BIG THING THAT SO NOT THE KIND OF SEMI CIRCLE I SUPPOSE IT IS ALMOST ISN'T IT YEAH I MEAN IT THEY DESCRIBED IT AS THE ELLIPTICAL WING AND IT'S IT'S A COMPLETELY UNIQUE TO THE SPITFIRE AND SIZE IT CERTAINLY IS THAT WING SHAPE THE FUSELAGE SHAPE BUT IT ALL COMBINES INTO JUST LOOKING
TO A VERY PLEASANT LOOKING AEROPLANE WHAT ABOUT FLYING
WELL IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT LOOKS RIGHT BUT IT TENDS TO FLY RIGHT AND THE SPITFIRE IS A BEAUTIFUL AEROPLANE TO FLY BECAUSE IT'S VERY RESPONSIVE IT'S LIGHT ON THE CONTROLS HE TALKS TO YOU IT'S A PILOT YOU GET ALL THE FEELINGS THAT YOU WOULD WISH FROM A SPITFIRE HOW DAVID TALKS TO YOU THAT'S AN INTRIGUING THOUGHT
YOU GET ALL THE VIBRATIONS THAT NOISE THE SMELLS MOST PILOTS COME AWAY FROM FLYING A SPITFIRE WITH A BIG GRIN ON THEIR FACE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO FLY RIGHT OF I IMAGINE IT WAS RATHER DIFFERENT DURING THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN WHEN YOU WERE FLYING THEM MANURE WAITING TO BE SHOT DOWN ANY MINUTE I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THEN WELL ABSOLUTELY IT WAS WELL GOOD THAT HE KEEPING THEM GOING ANYWAY JOHN REMAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

CHINA HAS CUT ITS GROWTH TARGETS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN OPENING THE ANNUAL NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS CHINA'S PREMIER LEAGUE SAID THE COUNTRY WOULD FACE ANOTHER CHALLENGING YEAR AND THAT THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY WAS GROWING
THE TIME IS NOW PAST JUST PAST EIGHT THE NEXT FEW DAYS MAY SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE GREAT MIGRATION CRISIS PERHAPS EVEN THAT CAUTIOUS ASSESSMENT IS TOO OPTIMISTIC BUT THAT IS AT LEAST A GLIMMER OF HOPE THAT THE VARIOUS MEETINGS OF LEADERS THIS WEEKEND AT THE CONTINUING CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA OR FRAGILE MAY HOLD OUT SOME PROMISE
EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE HOLDING A SUMMIT WITH TURKEY ON MONDAY TO TRY TO SORT OUT THE MESS THAT IS THE E. USE MIGRATION POLICY THEY MAY BE CLOSING IN ON A DEAL TO TRY TO RETURN ALL NON SYRIANS WHO ARRIVE ON THE GREEK ISLANDS DIRECTLY TO TURKEY AT CURRENT RATES OF ARRIVAL THAT COULD BE ABOUT HALF THE TOTAL BUT IT'S THE KIND OF DEAL THAT MAY BE EASIER TO AGREE ON THEN TO IMPLEMENT A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM LES BOSWELL AT LEAST A THOUSAND REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS CONTINUE TO ARRIVE ALMOST EVERY DAY
EARLY MORNING IN MID TO LENI AND A GREEK COASTGUARD VESSEL HAS JUST ARRIVED
HAVING PICKED UP MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE
SIX BOATS IN MITZI THERE NOW ON THE DOCKSIDE
MANY OF THEM INEVITABLY FROM SYRIA
KEEP HIM ON THE MAKE OF THE I'VE GOT A LOT SO MOHAMMED AND HIS FRIEND YEP HERE HAVE JUST ARRIVED IN THEY'RE DESCRIBING HOW THEY MANAGED TO GET ACROSS THE TURKISH POLICE ARE THERE THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEY GO IN THE SMUGGLERS ARRIVED AND YOU GET ON THE BOAT
AND IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE THING IS DOING COORDINATOR LIKE THINK WE GUINEA WIGAN AUSSIE INDIA DIONNE THAT'S THE SECOND COASTGUARD VESSEL HAS JUST ARRIVED MUCH SMALLER THAN THE FIRST ONE BUT ALSO
WITH MIGRANT SITTING ON PRETTY MUCH EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THE DAY
LAST TIME I WAS HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE RUBBER DINGHIES ON WHICH THE MIGRANTS WERE CROSSING THE SEA HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY INTO THE BEACH UNLESS THEY WERE IN REAL DIFFICULTY NOW IT SEEMS THE COASTGUARD ARE INTERCEPTING THE BOATS AS SOON
AS THEY'RE IN GREEK TERRITORIAL WATERS AND THEN BRINGING THEM ASSURE YOU THAT MY MOTHER AND MONEY
HIS SMILE HAS SPENT THE LAST TWENTY FIVE DAYS TRAVELLING FROM THERE
THE CAPITAL OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THAT'S HAVING A HELL OF A LETTER AND HAD UNDERSTOOD HERE WE HAD THE BUZZ OF THE JOURNEY WAS THIS UNION HIS BORDER
AND FIRED AT THAT MAN AND A WOMAN AND TWO YOUNG GUYS DIED THEY WERE CUTE I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES I STAYED ON THE BORDER FOR TWENTY DAYS AND THEN I CAME TO TURKEY NOW I'VE GOT THIS FAR BY BOAT
ONE HUP LEN MINISTER HAS BECOME CHEAP SYRIANS ANYTHING I THOUGHT THE CHEAPEST THING IS A HUMOUR I'LL CUSS YOU WANT A CUT
THIS NARROW STRETCH OF SEA HAS BECOME EUROPE'S FRONT LINE SAY SHOULD MORE BE DONE TO REDUCE THIS FLOW
A PLANNED NATO MISSION HERE HAS YET TO BEGIN THERE ARE SENSITIVITIES AND HISTORICAL RIVALRIES BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY ARE NOT HELPING MATTERS LIEUTENANT COMMANDER ANTHONY STUFF YOU DENNIS RUNS THE GREEK COAST GUARD HERE ON LES BOSS HE HAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTACT WITH HIS TURKISH COUNTERPARTS AND HE FEARS THE ARRIVAL OF WARMER WEATHER
AND CALMER SEAS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THE ATTITUDE
WITH TURKISH COURSE WON'T IF FLUFFLE CHANGE I THINK THE FLOORS WILL BE POLICING
WELL THE TURKS MAY DISPUTE SOME OF THAT AND THE POLITICAL FOCUS MAY BE SHIFTING TOWARDS A CONCERTED ATTEMPT TO DETER PEOPLE FROM TAKING TO THE SEA IN THE FIRST PLACE BY SENDING LARGE NUMBERS BACK TO TURKEY ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE
BUT REFUGEES FLEEING FROM WAR AND CONFLICT I LIKELY TO TRY AND TRY AGAIN LISTEN TO IN MAN'S STORY
DOESN'T MATTER I DON'T KNOW I FIRST TIME THEY TRIED THE BOOT STOPS THE MOTOR BROKE THE TAG IT'S A THIRTIES CAME AND TOOK THEM BACK TO TURKEY THEY PUT THEM IN PRISON FOR THREE DAYS LET ME TAKE THEIR FINGERPRINTS AND THEN THEY RELEASED
TED AGAIN THIS MORNING IF THE WAR ENDED WHAT WOULD YOU GO BACK
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO BACK TO SYRIA ICKY O.K. AM I DON'T KNOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE HAVOC IN THERE I'LL HAVE A LEATHER REVILE ME CHEERS TEMPORARY LIGHTS IS SEEN AS THE WAR GOES WELL ROLLO TEN ELEVEN COME ON
ANOTHER REMINDER THAT NOTHING WILL REALLY STOP MUCH OF THIS MASS MIGRATION UNTIL SOMEONE SOMEWHERE WORKS OUT HOW TO BRING THE VIOLENCE TEARING PLACES LIKE SYRIA PARK TO AN END THIS WILL BE A LONG HAUL
THAT WAS CHRIS MORRIS HAD I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT A LONG HAUL TO IS FROM UP ON THE SEA YOU COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION I ASKED HIM WHAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CAN REALLY DO ABOUT THE CRISIS GIVEN THAT COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRIA SLOVENIA CROATIA AND OF COURSE MACEDONIA HAD EFFECTIVELY SEALED THEIR BORDERS TO REINTRODUCE ABOARD THERE'S CONTROL IT IS THEIR RIGHT
HOLD THIS STUNT IS THAT IS AN ISSUE WOULD DOMESTIC PUBLIC ORDER SQUID LADIES BUT IT'S NOT FOREVER IT'S ONLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD SO
HE WAS CERTAINLY VERY CLEAR ON THAT THEY EXTEND THE INTRODUCTION CALLED BULLETS WENT ON FOR A SHORT PERIOD BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THERE FOR EVER SO THE DOORSTEPS AHEAD IN MAY WE HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW AND
AROUND THE END OF THE YEAR SHINGEN WILL FUNCTION AS IT HAD STUCK WITH FUNCTIONING BUT FITLY DURANT HOW CAN YOU BE SURE OF THAT
WE'RE GOING TO BE SURE OF THAT BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS THE SHANK HIM EVEN THE COMPASS YOU MENTION BEFORE SHE WAS A BIT LOOSE
SAID THAT THAT IT IS ONLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND THEY HAVE TO PROVE IT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS GOOD TO PROMOTE CORPORATION THERE MARGOT IS GUNTER'S BECAUSE AS I SAID THE SOME MONTHS AGO THIS BLAME GAME DOESN'T LEAD ANYWHERE
YOU ARE THE COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY COUNTRY IN EUROPE AS WE SPEAK INCLUDING THIS COUNTRY THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD SAY THIS ISN'T SUCH A CRISIS WE MUST ALL TAKE MANY MANY MORE REFUGEES THEN WE HAD TAKEN SO FAR AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO SO SO LONG AS THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO EXIST YES
MY ARSE IS VERY CLEAR HE HAD DEPICTED THE REALITY IN THEY'VE GOT A LOOK THE WAY EVERYBODY MUST HAVE B. BUT I'VE THOUGHT OF THE SHOW WE SHOULD HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT OF COURSE WE HAVE TO OPEN OUR DOORS THE FUGEES WE IN THE EURO NOT GENERATION BUT THE BLEEPER GENERATIONS HEAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S A MOMENT IN THE PAST SO
IAN CAN MAKE CREATING AT THE SAME TIME SAFE LYGO IT BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T FORGET THAT BECAUSE NOT ONLY A LOCATION WE DOGGONE SHABAD RESET THEM AND HAD VERY SOON WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FULL OF THE HOLY UNION PROPOSAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT EXISTING BEFORE BUT ON MY ANSWER'S YES EVERYBODY MUSTER
THIS BEAD AND THEY CONTRIBUTE IN MANAGING THIS SITUATION LET ME TELL SOMETHING GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE WHO ON MY NAME I MADE IT MY MY FIERCE I DON'T THINK THAT THIS SITUATION I WOULD STOP HIS AND UNLESS ALL THIS LUSH ASIAN SOLD THESE FORTS AND THE BEGGAR RECENTLY
TO BRING BACK STABILITY IN CELIA CROWNED BY SUCCESS AND WE MUST LOT ARE BEST IN ORDER TO DO IT BECAUSE
THIS WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF THE FIND OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS REGION AS LONG AS THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THEIR WORK IS ON FIRE PEOPLE ARE WOUNDED FLEE PERSECUTION SIBLEY TRAGEDIES AND OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE TO FIND
THE PATHS OPEN IN ORDER TO THE RIPE TOOK WHAT THEY BELIEVE IT IS HERE AND IT'S NOT FUNNY WAY TO BEING THAT HE BE A SAFE HAVEN IN EUROPE
AND IN THE MEANTIME YOUR OWN COUNTRY GREECE HOW MUCH LONGER CAN IT CONTINUE IN THE FACE OF THIS RELENTLESS SURGE OF PEOPLE LANDING ON IT SHORES
IT IS TRUE TO SAY THAT IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR AGREES BUT THERE ARE DEMISE THE RECEPTION MAKE HER POSTERS ABOUT THIS IT SAID IN THE BEGINNING NOW THEY HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE LAST FOUR MONTHS THE FINISHING NOW
WITH THE WORKS TO THE PART IN BROLGA'S WITH TWO BIG RECEPTION CENTRES SO GREECE IS DELIVERING
BUT GRACE MUST NOT BE ALONE
THE DAY WE AGREE IS RECEIVING A HUGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES MAINLY REFUGEES ON THE OTHER HAND FROM ITALY WHO WE EXPECT THEM
IN THE MONTHS THE GUM AND YOUR FLOORS ROBBIE REGULAR MIKE AND YOU WE MUST BE VERY VERY WELL PREPARED THEM SUPPORT I SUPPORT IS IN TERMS OF FINANCE HAS BETTER BY PROVIDING GREASE WITH EXPERTS WITH THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT TO INFRASTRUCTURE
WHICH AT THE MOMENT BELIES THE WHOLE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT EVER SAID THE BEGINNING WE MUST SEE THIS SITUATION IS A GLOBAL ISSUE THAT I WANT IMAGES FROM MARVELLOUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO US BUT KEPT TO BE WITH YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY TO NINE AND LET US HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE GUARDIAN EXPRESSES MUTED DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THE DECISION BY FACEBOOK TO OVERHAUL ITS FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND PAY MORE TAX IN THE U.K. FACEBOOK TURNS A NEW PAGE SAYS THE HEADLINE BUT IT'S TOO LITTLE TO LIKE THE INDEPENDENT IS SIMILARLY UNDERWHELMED TWO CHAIRS FOR FACEBOOK'S CONCESSION TO H.M.R.C.

IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE SHOULD CHILDREN PLAY RUGBY UNION OR INDEED RUGBY LEAGUE BOTH INVOLVE TACKLES WHERE ONE PLAYER HURLS HIMSELF OR HERSELF AT ANOTHER AND TRIES TO KNOCK THEM OVER OR DO THEY IF IT'S TAUGHT PROPERLY
TACKLING IS TAUGHT PROPERLY IS THAT A BIT LESS OF THE HURLING A BIT MORE OF A CAREFUL EFFORT TO BRING THE PERSON DOWN SAFELY FOR TACKLER AND PERSON TACKLED WE HEARD THIS WEEK FROM SEVENTY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO WROTE AN OPEN LETTER CALLING FOR NO MORE TACKLES THE B.B.C.'S BOB WALKER HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO A COUPLE OF YOUNG PLAYERS AT FERN WOOD SCHOOL IN NOTTINGHAM
AND AGED FIFTEEN YEARS ON AND A PLACE IN THE LESS TIME IS KIND OF THE OPPOSITION SENSORS
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU TO DO IS GET YOUR ARMS AROUND JOE'S LEGS SO WE DO NOT WANT A HEAD IN FRONT YOU DON'T GET HIT WITH ME O.K. SO YOU'RE A SENSOR LEICESTER TIGERS VERY PRESTIGIOUS PLACE MACHINING TACKLING IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO AND YOUR COACH
START OF HIGH STANDARD SO WE DON'T GET INJURED HAVE YOU EVER BEEN INJURED TACKLING
WHEN I FIRST START OF PLAY LIKE I REMEMBER IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES THEY'VE GOT INJURED WHEN I WAS TRYING TO TAX ON BUT THAT WAS DUE TO NOT TACKLING SO IN THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS OUT AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS SUGGESTION
MAYBE AT SCHOOL'S TACKLING SHOULD BE OUTLAWED I THINK IT SHOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF WISE THE GAME WON'T BE THE SAME AND KIDS WORK LIKE KNOW HOW TO PLAY IF THEY WANTED TO TRY TO OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL ALL CABBAGE NOW
JACKIE THORPE IS HEAD OF P.E. AT FERN WHAT SCHOOL AND HER TWO YOUNG SONS ALSO PLAY FOR A LOCAL CLUB
THEY WERE READY TO MOVE ON AND THEY REALLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF GETTING SOMEBODY TO THE GROUND AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOYS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONTACT SPORT MY CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS A P.E. TEACHER ON THE SIDE IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE TECHNIQUES ARE LEARNT PROPERLY
MY NAME IS EDDIE ALCOCK NOTTINGHAM MODERNS I ENJOY TACKLE IN EVEN IF HE'S ON THE PERSON IT'S JUST THAT'S FINE AND IF YOU GET IN THE RIGHT BODY POSITION
SO YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANY DOUBTS NEVER HAD ANY CONCERNS EVEN WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED OUT PLAYING THE GAME WHEN I STARTED A BIT BUT THEN I'VE GOT TAUGHT THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE AND WE DID THAT AND HE WAS FINE AND YOUR MATES SOMETIMES IN SCHOOL SOME OF THE ROOM A BIT SMALLER BUT THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE IS O.K.
TWO LADS TALKING TO BOB WALKER FIRWOOD SCHOOL IN NOTTINGHAM WHERE JOHN BY ADAM WHITE IS AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER OF ENGLAND RUGBY FOOTBALL SCHOOLS UNION FORMER SCHOOL'S COACH AND EGG AND IS ALSO ON THE LAND RETROS HYMERS COLLEGE IN HULL IS A RUGBY UNION COACH FOR THE UNDER THIRTEENS MONITOR YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING COULDN'T AND ADAM YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT THIS ABSOLUTELY SO OBVIOUSLY BUCKINGHAM RUGBY FOR A LONG TIME AND BEEN FULLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE RUGBY UNION FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN ENGLAND IF IT WAS
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF DATA THAT SUGGESTING THAT BUT THE TACKLE IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS IN A STUDY LAST WEEK FROM FROM IRELAND IN ULSTER WE FOUND THAT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF INJURIES ARE OCCURRING THE TACKLE ITSELF
WE HAVE OVER THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN RECEIVING AT LEAST ONE INJURY OF THAT JUST UNDER HALF OF INJURIES REQUIRED OVER A MONTH OFF TWENTY EIGHT PLUS DES
OFF PLAYING SPORTS SO FOR ME IT JUST SEEMS NONSENSICAL TOOK TO CONTINUE TACKLING IN SPORT WHEN WE CAN GET THE SAME HEALTH BENEFITS FROM TOUCH OR TAG RUGBY WE HAVE LESS OF THE RESCUE
I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE NOTION THAT EVERYONE WHO ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE GAME AS BURYING THEIR HEADS IN THE SAND ON THIS ISSUE IS COMPLETELY FALSE PLAY WELFARE AND SAFETY OF THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE DO AND I THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT BY THE R.F.U. WORLD RUGBY ANOTHER GOVERNING BODIES AROUND THE WORLD IN PLAY WELFARE TO SEE THAT I THINK THESE ARE EXTREME PROPOSALS ARE REALLY BASED ON CHERRY PICKED
DATA THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN HEAVILY CRITICISED BY OTHER ACADEMICS AND INTERESTINGLY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH AND THE FACULTY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE MEDICINE HAVE ALREADY ISSUED STATEMENTS AGAINST THE LETTER THAT WAS THAT WAS WRITTEN SO I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN
FLAWS IN THE IN THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IT IT IS BLANKET AT ALL YOUNG PLAYERS TOGETHER FROM THE AGE OF THIRTEEN TO TWENTY ONE AND THOSE AGES ARE SO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT BUT COMPARING THEM AS BASICALLY THE SAME AS COMPARING TWO DIFFERENT SPORTS
DO YOU ACCEPT ADAM WHITE BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH THIS KIND OF THING IS TAKEN WITHIN THE SPORT HAS CHANGED AND IS MUCH MUCH GREATER NOW
THAN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AND OBVIOUSLY OVER THE PAST FIVE TO SIX YEARS PLAY SAFETY HAS INCREASED OF COURSE THEY ARE A FEW HAS DONE GREAT THINGS IN THAT TIME WHAT ABOUT THE ENGLAND RUGBY FOOTBALL SCHOOLS YOU'RE ATTACHED TO BECAUSE AS I SAY IN THE GUARDIAN TODAY THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY STOPPED YOU FROM ATTENDING A SCHOOL'S EVENT THIS WEEKEND IS THAT TRUE YEAH SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT LIKE TO WE'VE BEEN ASKED NOT TO ATTEND THE UNDER FIFTEENS THAT WAS CUP SEMI FINALS TOMORROW
I WAS ALSO A PROFIT FROM AN EMAIL THIS WEEK WHICH WAS SENT TACT OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEY SAY WHERE THEY ARE A FIERCE EDNA STATEMENT THAT YOU OFFERED TO STEP DOWN FROM SAFEGUARDING IS THAT IS THAT NOT TRUE ABSOLUTELY NOT
THAT DOES SUGGEST DOESN'T IT THAT THEY'RE IN SOME KIND OF DENIAL WHAT WHAT I'M FINDING IS I'VE RAISED A NUMBER OF ISSUES OVER THE PAST YEAR SPECIFICALLY AROUND PLAY A SAFETY FOR INSTANCE THE ON MY HEADCASE PROGRAMME WHICH IS WHICH IS GREAT FOR THEIR RETURN TO PLAY PROGRAMME
HOWEVER THERE IS NO MENTION OF RETURN TO EDUCATION NOW WE KNOW THAT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES WE NEED TO REST THAT WAS IT THOSE BRAINS IF WE BROKE A LEG WE WANT OUR PEOPLE TO WALK ON IT HOWEVER WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND WE'RE NOT TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD HAVE TIME OFF SCHOOL
BECAUSE OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IT SEEMS ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL THAT THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN A PROGRAMME FOR TEACHERS ABOUT CONCUSSION
AT PRESENT THIS IS EMBRACED MEGA IF I CAN JUST IN THE GENT THERE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AT OUR SCHOOL IS THAT ALL UP ALL OUR COACHES ARE
BRIEFED ON CONCUSSION WE COMPLETE THE WORLD WOULD BE CONCUSSION MODULE AND THEY ARE WELL VERSED NOW IN WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH CONCUSSION AND RETURNED TO PLAY STRATEGY AS WELL AS THE RETURN TO EDUCATION STRATEGY AND THAT IS NOW FAR MORE CLOSELY MANAGED THAN IT WAS EVER EVER DONE IN THE ONE WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESS NICK NICK ARE GETTING PEOPLE TO PLAY AT THE SAME WEIGHT TRAVEL IN THE SAME YEAR AND SCHOOL WHICH IS SOMETHING HE DID IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES THEN THERE IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS I THINK THAT'S AN EASY WAY TO TO MAYBE SOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT I THINK IT IS TOO SIMPLISTIC
I KNOW THAT THE F. YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE MOMENT A BIO BANDING WHICH IS THE PRACTICE OF GROUPING YOUNG PLAYERS TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THEIR PHYSICAL MATURITY RATHER THAN THE RAGE SO AS AN EXAMPLE IN AN UNDER FOURTEEN SENIOR MAY HAVE AN EARLY MATURE WHO WAS THE BIOLOGICAL AGE OF SIXTEEN AND A LATE MATURE HE WAS THE BIOLOGICAL AGE OF A OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE R.F.U. ARE LOOKING AT AND WE'LL CONSIDER BUT I THINK AT THE MOMENT
SPINKS AND MACHLI AND HER STUDY COMPARED THE INJURY RISK IN A RANGE OF SPORTS AND THEY FOUND THAT UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN NO SINGLE SPORT STANDS OUT THIS HAVING A YOUR INJURY RISK THAN OTHERS ARE NOT ALSO HAD AND WHITE A REAL DANGER IF YOU SUDDENLY ALLOW ALLOW PEOPLE TO TACKLE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN USED TO DOING IT YOU INTRODUCE ALL SORTS OF POTENTIAL DANGERS FOR THEM ADDED DANGERS AND ACTUALLY AREN'T THERE AT THE MOMENT
SO I CONCERNING HIS FOCUS REALLY ON ON SCHOOL RUGBY AND OF COURSE IF WE IF WE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM TACKLING THE SCORER THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT WE'RE JUST PUSHING THE PROBLEM ALONG A FEW MORE YEARS BUT WE'RE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON HOW PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED TO PARTICIPATE AND P.E. LESSONS WHERE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENGAGING CONTACT RUGBY OFTEN IN SCHOOL IF PEOPLE WANT TO CHOOSE TO GO TO LOCAL CLUBS AND PARTICIPATING CONTACT RUGBY WHO AM I TO TELL THEM THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
HOWEVER IT'S JUST THAT COMPULSORY ELEMENT AND WE'RE HEARING FROM LOTS OF PARENTS AND LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO PLAY CONTACT RUGBY AND P.A. AND SURELY THAT'S THERE RIGHT VERY BRIEFLY IN A SHOULD BE THERE RIGHT SHOULDN'T
NO I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE COMPULSORY TO GO AND GET BASHED EVEN IF YOU HATE THE THOUGHT OF IT NO I DON'T I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO THE QUALITY OF COACHING AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE RISK OF INJURY IN RUGBY IS NO DIFFERENT TO ANY OTHER SPORT UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN SO I THINK IF WE WERE GOING TO DECIDE TO BARN TACKLING AND RUGBY I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK AT PUTTING A WHOLE RANGE OF SPORTS AND I THINK TO OFFER SOME PERSPECTIVE
THE RISK OF PLAYING RUGBY AS A CHILD IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN GENERAL PLAY AND BY FAR THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION TO HEAD INJURIES AND CONCUSSIONS IN CHILDREN AND IMAGINE ACTUALLY PLAYGROUND ACCIDENTS AWFUL LOT OF PARENTS LISTENING TO THIS AS CONFLICTED AS AS YOU TO A THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT AIRING IT FOREST ADAM WHITE AND THAT GANDHI AS WELL
TWENTY NINE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME TALKING AT THE START OF THE PROGRAMME TO OUR REPORTER GAVIN LEE WHO'S BEEN ON THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA ALL WEEK WATCHING THE MIGRANTS ARRIVING TRYING AND FAILING TO GET INTO MACEDONIAN FROM THERE TO COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY AND SWEDEN HE'S BEEN REPORTING ON THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS IT'D BE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO BUT NOW HE THINKS WE'RE SEEING AS THE SECOND WAVE OF MIGRANTS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THAT BOARD AT OUR CHILDREN
AND THAT'S EVEN MORE WORRYING OBVIOUSLY DONE STEWART OF SAY THE CHILDREN'S EMERGENCIES TEAM IS ON THE BORDER HIMSELF AND VERY NEAR THE CAMP HE WAS IN IT YESTERDAY MY SUIT WHAT TO A GATHERING IS CALCULATED RUSTLY WAS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE CHILDREN DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT WELL THE ESTIMATE THE WAY WORKING WITH IN NEED TO MANY TREACHERY DEFENCE OF THEIR CHILDREN
BELINDA COME THAT'S BEEN ASKED FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN CURRENTLY WAITING ON THE GREEK SIDE OF THE BORDER THAT IS A HUGE NUMBER AND ARE THEY ALL WITH PARENTS ARE THEY BEING PROPERLY LOOKED AFTER NO ABSOLUTELY
WE'RE WORKING WITH WORKING TO TRY AND HELP I DON'T BUY THESE VULNERABLE CHILDREN TAKE THEIR CHILDREN'S WORKING RELAX ABOUT IT TO ENSURE THAT WHERE WE CAN FIND A MYRIAD ACHIEVED THERE ARE KIND OF COUNSELLING AND SUPPORT BUT THEY NEED US BUT SOME OF THEM ARE BY THEMSELVES ON IT WHAT CAN YOU GET THEM INTO SOME SORT OF I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER AND LOOK AFTER THEM OR WHAT WELL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
SO YOU'VE GOT WENT I'M SORRY I'M JUST TRYING TO IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WITH A ONE YEAR OLD CHILD LOOKING AFTER ONE HE'S FIFTEEN YEP YEAH HE WAS THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE CAMP ITSELF IS DESIGNED AT THE MOMENT YOU WANT TO ASK IF I'M GOING TO BUY A TEN THOUSAND SO
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AND DO PLEASE KEEP US IN TOUCH DOWN STUART THANK YOU SO MUCH THE TIME SEVEN MINUTES TONIGHT NO CAN WOMEN LEARN MORE ABOUT MEN BY READING A BOOK WRITTEN BY A MAN AND VICE VERSA I ASK THE QUESTION DAFT TO IMPRESS
DEFINITELY BECAUSE OF THE CREATES SUCCESS RECENTLY OF TWO NOVELS ONE BY THE NORWEGIAN AUTHOR CARL OVE HARD I THINK AND THE OTHER BY THE ITALIAN ELENA FERRANTE AND BOTH GOING TO GREAT DETAIL EMBARRASSING DETAIL IT NOSE GUARDS CASE ABOUT FAMILY LIFE WE HAVE ASKED TWO REALLY GOOD AUTHORS KATHY LETTE AND NOT OF OTHER SUGGESTING THE OTHERS AREN'T WE WILL DECIDE CATHY LEFT AND TIM BLOTTER REPEATS NOVELS BUT KATHY YOU READ THE NOTES GARDEN TIM YOU READ FOR AUNTIE'S
AND KATHY THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS WELL IT WAS A FASCINATING READ BECAUSE MOST ANGLO SAXON MEN THEIR EMOTIONAL BONSAI YOU HAVE TO WET THE FERTILISER ON TO GET HER FEELINGS OUT OF THEM AND WE HAVE TO OPEN HEART SURGERY ON AN ENGLISHMAN BUT TO FIND OUT WHAT HE'S FEELING THIS GUY
HAEMORRHAGES EMOTION HE DOES A PSYCHOLOGICAL STRIPTEASE THAT REVEALS ALL WAR AND THAT'S KIND OF FASCINATING FOR WOMEN TO GET THEIR INSIDE INTO THE MALES BUT DO YOU SO YOU ARE KATHY LETTE LEARNING ABOUT MEN BUT ON BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY YES MEN WHO CRIED SHOWS THAT THEY'RE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR FEELINGS BUT IT OFTEN THEIR ONLY IN TOUCH WITH THEIR OWN FEET AND WE GET A LITTLE BIT IT'S TOO SUSPICIOUS WHEN IT'S A TOTAL SOB STORY LIKE THIS
I WOULD SAY IN DEFENCE OF BRITISH MEN YOU KNOW I CAME MAYBE EMOTIONALLY ARTICULATE BUT YOU DO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOUR AND THIS HAS THIS BOOK AS A TOTAL IRONY ECTOMY THERE'S NOT ONE NOT ONE JOKE NOT ONESELF TO BIT OF SELF DEPRECATING AND THEN I FOUND INCREDIBLY TEDIOUS RIGHT WHAT ABOUT HIM TELL ME THAT YOU FOUND THAT THE FERRANTE WAS DIFFERENT HELPED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
WELL THIS IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE RATHER MEN OR WOMEN I THINK AND I THINK THEY'RE BOTH VERY GOOD I THINK HE'S FANTASTIC WRITER I THINK NOW SCARRED IS CLOSE TO BEING A GENIUS I THINK I THINK THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW
WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES ARE GREAT SIMILARITIES SEEM STRANGE TO ME I MEAN I MEAN THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS SO SOMETHING WHAT CATHY SAID IN THAT AND THE FRANTIC BOOK IS ABOUT HER FRIEND AND IT'S ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM AND I THINK THAT KIND OF FEMALE FRIENDSHIP TROPE IS VERY POWERFUL AMONGST ONE IN PARTICULAR YOUNGER WOMEN AND IT IS QUITE NARCISSISTIC NOW SCAR ONE IT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT HIMSELF HE'S GOT LOVE BITES ON HIS MIRROR
THAT'S ONE WAY OF HUNTING BUT HE BUT HE DOES IT SO BRILLIANTLY SO PENETRATING SO HONEST BUT THE FRANTIC BOOK IS FANTASTIC AND GOOD TOO BECAUSE IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE SORT OF ALMOST CHICKLET OH NO NO THAT'S THE WAY THEY GET MARKS IS THAT'S IT'S VERY WOMEN'S LITERATURE I WAS VERY VERY GOOD WRITERS OUT THERE HOLD ON GET BIDDERS AS IF A WOMAN HAD WRITTEN THIS BOOK THIS CANAL SKY BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN IT WAS YOU WERE A CUPCAKE ON THE COVER A PINK COVER
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED AS YOU SAY AS CHEAP CLIP BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT DOMESTICITY AND MOST WOMEN I GET MENUS USUALLY TACKLE BIG THEMES IN THERE LITERALLY ALWAYS WEAR THAT FAMILY AT WAR AND DEATH WOMEN IT'S STILL TANGLING QUITE OFTEN NO WINNER NO MORE NO THERE'S STILL TERRIBLY SEXUAL POLITICS COS THERE'S BRASS TO SIX WAS STILL RAGING THE BATTLEGROUND OF THE KITCHEN AND THE BEDROOM
AND THAT THEY'RE ALL AND HOPEFULLY RAISING WELL YOU PRETEND THAT YOU'VE WON BUT JUST LOOK AT THAT IT'S A BIT I KNOW BUT I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE NOVELTY FACTOR THAT HE SPENDS A LOT OF THE BOOK
YOU KNOW YOU SHOPS ANY HE MOPS AND HE TALKS FOR MOST BRITISH WOMEN SMALL INTESTINES COMMUNICATE WITH US MORE OFTEN THAN OUR HUSBANDS SO I THINK WOMEN ARE READING IT BECAUSE IT'S SO EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE A MAN WHO'S AT HOME IN THE KITCHEN AND I MUST SAY MEN SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS BECAUSE I READ NOW COS THE OTHER DAY THAT SAID THAT SPERM BANKS ALL AROUND THE WORLD THE MOST DESIRED SPERM IS DANISH NO WE'VE WATCHED ALL THOSE BOX SET
WHERE THE MOST ARTICULATE AND THE COOKING CLEANING AND DOING SINCE YOUR THINGS WITH SNOW PEAS IN THE KITCHEN AND THAT'S WHAT WOMEN WANT WORK THAT YOU COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM THAT WOMEN WANT DANISH SPERM NO NOT REALLY I HAVEN'T GOT ANY BUT IT WANTS TO QUESTION WHAT I GOT
I'D LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTION GO ON I'M REALLY FASCINATED THAT YOU LOVED THAT FRIEND TABLE BECAUSE WHAT INTERESTS ME IS THAT MEN DON'T OFTEN READ I'M A BIT PREJUDICED YEAH AND I'M I SPENT FAR TOO MUCH OF MY LIFE YEAH I LIKE MARTIN AMIS I'M SOMEWHAT HOMOSEXUAL REMIND LITERARY TASTES AND I TEND TO SORT OF READ I TEND TO BE ATTRACTED TO MEN BECAUSE SOMEHOW THERE AS AS AS THEIR EXPERIENCE SPEAKS TO ME MORE DIRECTLY
IN THAT WOMEN THERE HAS IN THE PAST BY CHANGING EITHER I'VE BEEN READING FERRANTE AND I'VE BEEN READING AND ELIZABETH STRATUM AND TYLER AND THEY'RE WONDERFUL THEY DO WRITE VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM MEN MEN MEN ARE MUCH MORE SORT OF TEND TO BE THOUGH THAT SECTION BUT I TEND TO BE VERY TO THE POINT GET DOWN TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT GET ON WITH THE PLOT BUT STOP THERE BUT I WONDER IF MEN DON'T READ SEEMA FICTION COS I THINK THEY TEAR FIGHTS AT SOME TAMPONS CAN LEAP THAT NOR THEIR ARM OFF UP TO THE ELBOW OR
DO THEY SECRETLY THINK THAT WOMEN ARE INFERIOR WRITERS AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY SUSPECT IS THE CASE YES I DO O.K. SO I THINK ALL THE BOYS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY JUMP BETWEEN WILL MY COVERS SACKED GUARANTEED ALL RIGHT I'VE GOT TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU'VE WRITTEN MAD COWS CAUGHT IN TROUBLE THE BOY WHO FELL TO EARTH THOSE THAT THOSE ARE JUST A FEW TO MOP THE WHITE BLUE AND RUMOURS OF A HURRICANE IF YOU WERE WRITING AT BEST TRY THIS QUESTION WITH YOU TIM IF YOU WERE WRITING AS A WOMAN WOULD BE RIGHT HE'LL BE DIFFERENT
WELL I DO WRITE AS A WOMAN SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE I WRITE WOMEN CARROTS SO THEREFORE I HAVE TO GET INTO THE HEAD OF WOMEN TO WRITE THEM CONVINCE WE HOW CONVINCED I CAN DO IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME AS IT IS FOR A WOMAN TO GET INTO THAT OF A MAN YOU KNOW AND THAT'S THAT'S A CHANNEL SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION CUT HAS BEEN BASED ON A FALSE PREMISE THAT THEY SOUGHT A FALSE PREMISE YES THAT'S TO SAY THAT
THANK YOU BOTH KATHY LETTE DO LOCKED UP AT WOMEN'S FICTION THAT'S LAYING THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT YOU THE DANISH SPERM AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE PROGRAMME OR LAUREN COOPER AND JO MOORE'S THEY WERE OUT OF FROM JOHN AND FROM ME GOODBYE
