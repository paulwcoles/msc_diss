BEN THANKS SEVEN MINUTES PARSECS OR LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS AN INTERESTING STORY ABOUT HEDGE FUNDS AND INVESTMENT BANKS HAVE COMMISSIONED PRIVATE EXIT POLLS IN A BID TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THE RESULT OF THE U.K. A REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP NEXT MONTH THE F. T. SAYS BY FINDING OUT VOTING PATTERNS EARLY ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD AND PREDICTING THE OUTCOME TRADERS THE PAPER SAYS CAN LAY BIG BET ON THE RESULT THE HEAD THE FIRST MARKET PARTICIPANTS
TO MAKE A MINT ON A GOVERNMENT INDUCED SWING IN STERLING SINCE GEORGE SORROWS BET AGAINST THE PALM AND IT CRASHED OUT OF THE EUROPEAN EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHAT THE PAPER SAYS THAT EARLY INDICATIONS OF THE LIKELY RESULT IN THE REFERENDUM WILL BE INDIRECTLY VISIBLE FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND STIRLING DERIVATIVE MARKETS BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSE
IF THERE IS REALLY BIG MONEY BET ON THE RESULT ANOTHER WAS WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING WILL BE AVAILABLE NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO'VE PAID FOR THESE SURVEYS AND THEY COST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND QUID A SET TIME BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY TO THE REST OF US AS WHAT WORRIES OVER THE POLICING OF BRITAIN'S COASTLINE PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR THREE OF THE PAPERS THE MALE THE TIMES AND THE EYE THE DAILY MAIL SAYING THAT MINISTERS WERE LAST NIGHT ACCUSED OF STAGGERING COMPLACENCY FOR IGNORING A STRING OF WARNINGS THAT BRITAIN'S SMALL PORTS
ARE AN EASY TARGET FOR PEOPLE SMUGGLERS FOR REPORTS MOST RECENT LAST WEEK HAVE SOUNDED THE ALARM OVER LACKS BORDER CONTROLS BUT THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED THE THREAT WAS NOT CURRENTLY ASSESSED AS BEING SIGNIFICANT AT THE TIME SAYS THAT AS WELL AS THE WORRIES ABOUT THE SOUTH COAST SO ALSO WARNINGS IN NORFOLK AND SUFFOLK THAT REMOTE CREEKS AND ESTUARIES WERE ATTRACTIVE TO SMUGGLERS BECAUSE THERE WERE FEW PATROLS AND THE BOY HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO LUCY MORETON GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES
WHO SAYS LARGE STRETCHES OF BRITAIN'S COASTLINE ON POLICED AND OFFICIAL SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY UNDETECTED SHE SAID THIS IS THE WORST WE'VE EVER SEEN IT IN THE WORSE THAT HAS EVER BEEN RECORDED BUT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LOOK FOR THIS UNTIL RECENTLY THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS SKIN CANCER CURE HOPE FOR MILLIONS ON ITS FRONT PAGE HAD SINCE HEADLINE WOULD NEVER QUITE KNOWS ABOUT THESE HEALTH STORIES BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE GENUINELY AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE AT LEAST FOR SOME PATIENTS WHO HAVE ADVANCED SKIN CANCER
A DYING SKIN CANCER PATIENT WAS SAVED THE MIRROR SAYS BY REVOLUTIONARY NEW TREATMENT THE MADE HIS TUMOURS VANISH COMPLETELY FIFTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN GIVE IN A MIX OF TWO IMMUNOTHERAPY IS AFTER ALL ELSE FAILED TO STOP THE MELANOMA AND THE PAPER SAYS IT OFFERS HOPE TO MILLIONS OF SUFFERERS OF SKIN CANCER AND HE QUOTES A BRITISH DOCTOR SAYING OF THE THERAPIES WE CAN NOW START THINKING OF USING THE WORD CURE
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX IRAQI FORCES ARE ENGAGED IN WHAT THEY HOPE WILL BE THE PUSH INTO FOR LUDO THAT LIBERATES IT FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS IN THE HANDS OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE JIM YOU'RE OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW FROM BAGHDAD WHAT SENSE DO YOU GET JIM OF HOW THIS OFFENSIVE IS GOING
WELL I THINK SLOWLY THAT WAS KIND OF PREDICTABLE WHAT'S HAPPENING AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE IN THERE LOTS OF CONFLICTING AND RATHER VAGUE REPORTS GOING ON AS THAT FAIRLY MOTLEY ARRAY OF GOVERNMENT FORCES AND MILITIAS ARE PUSHING IN STILL TOWARDS THE CITY WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BROKEN INTO THE PERIMETER OF THE CITY ITSELF BUT THE PUTTING A NON VARIOUS AXES I THINK MOST PROMINENTLY FROM THE SOUTH WHERE THIS SO CALLED COUNTER TERRORISM FORCE THE C.T. F. WHICH WAS AN ELITE COMBAT UNIT
PUT TOGETHER AN ARMED AND TRAINED BY THE AMERICANS THEY'VE BEEN PUNCHING UP AND THEY ARE AS FAR AS WE CAN GO THERE JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS SHORT OF THE CITY LIMITS AS WERE A QUARTER CALLED SURE THEY'VE TAKEN OVER A NEARBY TOWNSHIP
ON OTHER FRONTS THE FORCES ARE MAKING SLOWER PROGRESS THIS PHASE AS FAR AS I CAN FIGURE OUT HE'S STILL THERE ONE OF TRYING TO COMPLETE A CIRCLE OF STEEL AROUND FOR LUCHA NOT THE FINAL ASSAULT ON THE ACTUAL CITY ITSELF WHETHER ARE BELIEVED TO BE SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND CIVILIANS TRAPPED OR NOT BEING LET OUT BY EAR OH YES OF COURSE LEAVING AT OME TO CHARGES OF USING THEM AS A HUMAN SHIELD AND HOW MANY MEMBERS OF DO WE THINK ARE INSIDE THE CITY AND HOLDING IT
AGAIN CONFLICTING FIGURES THE AMERICANS ARE INDICATING SOMETHING LIKE BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN HUNDRED I'VE HEARD THE FIGURES RATHER HIGHER THAN THAT UP TO ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED OF WHOM IT'S BELIEVED THE MAJORITY NOT ALL BUT SOMETHING LIKE TWO THIRDS A LOCAL FIGHTERS FROM CLUJ ITSELF WHICH HAS A LONG TRADITION OF SUNNI MILITANCY SO THAT'S NOT VERY SURPRISING SO AT LEAST SOME OF THESE FAMILIES WERE TALKING ABOUT
MUST ALSO BELONG TO THESE FIGHTERS SO IT IS A VERY A VERY CONFUSED AND COMPLICATED AND VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IS CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH WITH NINE MONTHS OF SIEGE WITH VERY LITTLE FOOD AND WATER DIRTY WATER FROM THE RIVER VERY LITTLE MEDICATION ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO LIVE AND NOW THEY FACE MORTAL PERIL WITH THIS IMPENDING ASSAULT SO REALLY A VERY DARK LIGHT INDEED AND IS THAT ASSAULT THAT IRAQI SORT BEING SUPPORTED FROM THE AIR BY INTERNATIONAL FORCES
YES BUT NOT ON ALL FRONTS BASICALLY THEY WORK WITH THE CORE GOVERNMENT TROOPS ESPECIALLY THE COUNTER TERRORISM FORCE THEY'RE TRYING NOT TO BOMB IN SUPPORT OF SHIA MILITIAS WHO ARE SUPPORTED BY IRAN IN FACT IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS COMMANDER COS SOME SORT OF MONEY WAS ON THE FIELD THERE LAST TUESDAY DIRECTING OPERATIONS SO THEY MOUNTAINS ARE KEEN NOT TO BE SEEN AS THE AIRFORCE OF IRANIAN BACKED MILITIAS
JIM YOU'RE IN BAGHDAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX CHILD CHILDREN LIVING WITH DIABETES ARE NOT GETTING ALL THE CHECKS THAT THEY SHOULD JANE DRAPERIES HEALTH CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LION TAMER TALKING MAINLY ABOUT CHILDREN WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES THE AUTO IMMUNE AND INCURABLE KIND
THAT'S RIGHT YES THIS IS AN AUDIT THE TWELFTH ONE OF ITS KIND WHERE THEY'VE LOOKED AT EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHO HAS DIABETES AND AS YOU SAY THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE TYPE ONE WHICH MEANS THEY CANNOT PRODUCE INSULIN AND NEED DAILY MEDICATION AND IT'S LOOKING AT THEIR CARE AND SEEING WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT CARE WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU DRIVE UP STANDARDS
AND FINDING WHAT THAT ONLY A QUARTER ARE RECORDED AS HAVING THE RECOMMENDED NUMBER OF ANNUAL HEALTH CHECKS THESE KICKIN WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE TWELVE AND THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT CHECKS THEY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE POSSIBLE KIDNEY DAMAGE ALSO WHETHER CHOLESTEROL BLOOD PRESSURE LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH AND THEY DO EYE AND FOOT CHECKS AND IT IS CONCERNING DIABETES U.K. SAYS IT'S VERY WORRYING THAT THESE CHEQUES AREN'T ALWAYS CARRIED OUT
THE AUDIT SAYS IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT BEING WRITTEN DOWN BUT CERTAINLY IT LOOKS AS THOUGH QUITE A FEW ARE BEING MISSED ALTOGETHER THAT'S POOR CARE WELL BUT WHY ARE THEY BEING MISSED THEM AND GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO THEM AND GIVEN THEM THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT THE GOOD THAT THEY CAN DO WHAT'S GOING WRONG WELL THE AUDIT SAYS THAT SOMETIMES IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING RECORDED BUT FOR ONLY A QUARTER TO BE RECORDED IT SUGGESTS THAT SOME ARE BEING MISSED AND IT'S JUST SHOWING THAT
THERE ISN'T THE RIGHT CARE FOR ALL THESE CHILDREN THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE CARE THEY SHOULD RECEIVE IN EVERY CASE AND THERE'S STILL TOO MUCH VARIATION THAT IS CONCERNING BECAUSE THESE ARE WAYS THAT YOU CAN PICK UP VITAL EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS THAT COULD REALLY AFFECT THESE CHILDREN IN LATER LIFE JANE DRAPER BANKS
IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX UNCONVENTIONAL CENTRAL BANK POLICY TAKES YET ANOTHER UNCONVENTIONAL TWIST IN EUROPE ROB YEUNG HAS THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS THIS MORNING ROOM YES MORNING THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS ABOUT TO STEP UP ITS INTERVENTION IN THE MARKET RAMPING UP THE PRINTING PRESSES YET FURTHER
IT'S TRYING TO INCREASE THE EURO AREAS SLUGGISH ECONOMIC GROWTH BY BUYING BONDS ISSUED BY COMPANIES ESSENTIALLY THE E.C. B. WILL LEND MONEY TO BUSINESSES MONETARY POLICY MAKERS HOPE THIS ESCALATION OF THE APPALLINGLY NAMED QUANTITATIVE EASING WILL REDUCE THE FINANCING COSTS FOR BUSINESSES AND SO ENCOURAGED THEM TO INVEST WILL OUR MARKETS GUEST THIS MORNING IS LAURA LAMINATE THE SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT INVEST WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MORNING LAURA MORNING WHAT IS THE STATE OF THE EURO AREA'S ECONOMY
WELL WE'RE EXPECTING G. D. P. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER TO COME IN AT POINT FIVE PER CENT WE ALSO HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT FALLING FROM VERY HIGH LEVELS IN MARCH OF TEN POINT TWO AND WE'VE GOT VERY BENIGN INFLATION MINUS POINT TO ALL OF THAT COMBINED IS PROBABLY MAKING CONSUMERS A BIT MORE CONFIDENT SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY
BUT STILL BE THE EUROZONE IT'S A LONG WAY BEHIND OTHER DEVELOPED ECONOMY SUCH AS THE U.S. AND THE U.K. IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY RIGHT AND WE HAD SOME ENCOURAGING ECONOMIC SIGNED YESTERDAY FROM FRANCE AND GERMANY IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT IMPACT THE E. C.B.S POLICY'S BEEN HAVING ON THE ECONOMY
WELL THE QUANTITY OF USING STARTED IN EUROPE ONLY IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR
IF WE LOOK AT THE U.S. FOR EXAMPLE THE EXTREME BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS GROWN HUGELY OVER THAT TIME AND SOME OF THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THINK YOU EAT
AND THERE'S A C. THE EUROZONE WAS A LATE STARTER THEY'RE BUYING OF SORTS AND DATE HAS NOW BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE CORPORATE BOND BUYING
AND ONE HAS TO REMEMBER THAT THEY'RE EUROPEAN CONFIT BON MARKET IS VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN THE U.S. SO IT AT THE JURY'S OUT TO SEE IF IF THAT'S GOING TO TO HAVE THE SAME IMPACT THAT THE U.S. HAD ON ITS ECONOMIC RECOVERY ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR THAT LAURA STAY WITH US THEY ALSO HERE AS EWAN MUNRO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VIVA INVESTORS WHICH MANAGERS TWO HUNDRED NINETY BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF ASSETS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
DO YOU AGREE WITH LOWER THOUGH THAT THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON WHETHER THE E.C. POLICY HAS BEEN WORKING
YES I THINK THE JULIA'S STILL IF YOU MEAN IS HE GOING TO RESTORE A HIGHER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE EUROZONE AND RESTORE INFLATION BACK TOWARDS ITS TARGET IT HASN'T DONE THAT YET SO THE JURY'S DEFINITELY STILL MAKING HIS DECISION RIGHT AND SO AS THE E.C. BE RAMPS UP THAT THIS EXTRAORDINARY MONETARY POLICY JUST IN IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS WHAT IS IT ABOUT TO DO
AS ABOUT TWO BY CORPORATE BONDS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE LENDING INSTRUMENTS TO COMPANIES QUITE SPECIFICALLY AS BUYING BONDS HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY KAI QUALITY COMPANY'S INVESTMENT COMPANIES WE CALL THEM SO IT'S NOT SMALL COMPANIES OR OR A WEAK ENTERPRISES COMPANY'S MOST ABLE TO BORROW IN THE MARKET'S ALREADY SO IT SOUNDS AS IF THE LENDING MONEY TO THEIR COMPANIES ARE ALREADY RELATIVELY EASILY ABLE TO LEND MONEY
EXACTLY AND I MEAN I THINK THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY WANT YOU GET MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WITH QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAMMES IF YOU ADDRESS A PROBLEM SO WHEN THE U.S. CAME IN ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY DID WAS REPORT WHAT THEY CALLED THE TARNISHED POLICIES HAVE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE STRESS DEBT
AND THEY WERE ADDRESSING A PROBLEM AND THE ECONOMY WHEN THE EUROPEAN ZONE FIRST KEY MEN WHEN HE SHOULD BE FIRST CAME WHERE'S QUALITY ABUSING THEY WERE BUYING THE DEBT OF GREECE AND ITALY AND PORTUGAL ALL AND COMPANY THE COUNTRIES AT THAT TIME NO ONE WANTED TO SUPPORT
IT'S DIFFICULT THE PROBLEM THIS IS A SOLUTION TO WRITE AND SO WHAT PROBLEMS COULD IT POTENTIALLY CREATE ARE ONE OF THE DANGERS THAT LIE IN THIS POLICY AS SUNLIGHT WAS TO BE A NEGATIVE FOR A FINANCIAL ASSETS WHEN YOU BRING DOWN INTEREST RATES AND FLEET FINANCIAL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND THAT'S GOING TO GIVE LARGE COMPANIES THE ABILITIES TO ISSUED THERE AND EITHER BY EACH OTHER
OR BUY BACK THEIR OWN CHEERS SO IT'S PROBABLY IN THE SHORT TERM BENEFICIAL FOR THE STOCKMARKET AND WILL GIVE SOME OPTION TO LARGE COMPANIES LOOK THE QUESTION IS IS IT GOING TO GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE OF THESE COMPANIES GOING TO ISSUE THIS DEBT AND BUILD NEW FACTORIES AND CREATE JOBS
THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE WITH HAPPEN BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO SEE HAPPENING TO GENUINELY LEAD TO ECONOMIC GROWTH O.K. THANK YOU YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF VIVA INVESTORS WELL ONE PART OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT IS SOARING AHEAD IS INDIA IT'S OVERTAKEN CHINA TO BECOME THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING LARGE NATION DATA OUT LATER TODAY IS EXPECTED TO SHOW INDIA'S ECONOMY GREW BY SEVEN AND A HALF PER CENT IN THE FIRST
IN THE YEAR TO THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR CHINA EXPANDED BY A LESS IMPRESSIVE BUT STILL INCREDIBLY STRONG SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT OVER THE SAME PERIOD A CORRESPONDENT YOU IF YOU TELL HER MY IS IN IN MUMBAI MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY IS HIS GROWTH ACCELERATING IN INDIA AS APPEARS TO BE THE CASE WHEN THERE IS A SLOW DOWN ACROSS THE WORLD
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS WHICH HAVE GONE IN INDIA'S FAVOUR THE FIRST THING IS THE MASSIVE DROP IN OIL PRICES THAT WE'VE SEEN INDIA IMPORTS ALMOST ALL OF THE OIL THAT IT NEEDS AND THEREFORE A DROP IN OIL PRICES MEANS THAT IMPORTANT BILL HAS GONE DOWN THAT'S PUT MORE MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY ARE NOW USING TO SPEND ON THINGS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAS BEEN THE BIG DRIVER FOR INDIA'S ECONOMY THE OTHER THING IS THAT INDIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DOMESTICALLY DRIVEN ECONOMY WHICH MEANS IT'S IT IT'S IT RISES IF PEOPLE INSIDE IT ARE CONSUMING IT'S NOT AS DEPENDENT ON EXPORTS ARE SAY THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS
AND WE HAVE SEEN DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION ACTUALLY GO UP ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THAT WE HAVE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES OVER THE PAST YEAR SO WE SEE THINGS LIKE SALES OF CARS AND TWO WHEELERS HAVE GROWN BY DOUBLE DIGITS
YOU SAID A LOT OF THIS IS DOWN TO THE SPENDING OF THE GOVERNMENT WHAT ABOUT POLICIES BEYOND SIMPLY JUST SPLASHING THE CASH WE HAVE A NEW NEWISH PRIME MINISTER MODI OR HIS REFORMS MANAGING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE POOREST
WELL FIRSTLY MANY OF THE REFORMS THAT HE PROMISED HAD NOT ACTUALLY
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO FAR THERE ARE A COUPLE OF LAWS ON TAXES ARE ON ACQUIRING LAND FOR PROJECTS THESE ARE STUCK IN PARLIAMENT THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW WITH INFLATION HAVING COME DOWN AND THIS AGAIN IS THE RESULT OF OIL PRICES DROPPING SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE SEEN INFLATION COMING DOWN IN INDIA SO EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ACTUALLY ANY REFORMS AT SUCH IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT THINGS LIKE FOOD PRICES HAVE NOT SWORD WHICH MEANS THAT
AT LEAST FOR THE POOREST IN THE COUNTRY THE COST OF LIVING HAS AND RISIN FURTHER FROM WHAT IT WAS AND SO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED ALL OF THEIR REFORMS IF TALKED A LOT THEY HAVE TRIED TO PUSH THE THROUGH PARLIAMENT BUT THEY ARE THEY ARE CERTAINLY STUCK ON A COUPLE OF BIG LAWYERS OH KAY THANK YOU COULD YOU TELL HER MY DAY IN MUMBAI WILL STILL WITH US IS THE SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT INVEST TECH WEALTH AND INVESTMENT
IS INDIA A RARE BRIGHT SPOT IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY LAURA YES IT WOULD APPEAR SO THE OTHER INTERESTING FACT IS THAT OPERATING PROFITS FOR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE COMPANIES AND THE ANT REPORTED IN INDIA HAVE A BLIP BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR AND IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE SIX SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT DECLINE
IN AMERICAN AND S. AND P. COMPANIES THAT'S REALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE STOCKMARKET DOING WELL SO NOT ONLY IS THE THE ECONOMY DOING WELL BUT COMPANIES ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT AND SHARE PRICES ARE GOING UP
WE DON'T MENTION THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES PROBABLY A LITTLE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING WHICH HAS THAT HEDGE FUNDS AND INVESTMENT BANKS ARE COMMISSIONING THEIR OWN PRIVATE EXIT POLLS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM IS THIS THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT SUCH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DO YOU DURING ELECTIONS OR SOMETHING PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY
AND I SUSPECT A PLEA ON STIRLING AS ONE OF THE MORE OBVIOUS WAYS OF EITHER MAKING WERE LOSING MONEY AND DEPENDING ON WHICH WE THE REFERENDUM GOES IN IN JUNE IT'S THERE ARE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND BOTH SIDES AND STIRLING IS VERY MUCH THE THE
NOT ONLY IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED MOST BY THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN TRADE STIRLING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SO THAT CYPRUS IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING
AHEAD OF THE THE OFFICIAL ACTOR PAUL NO DOUBT AN ABSOLUTE THERE'S ALSO A SURVEY AROUND TODAY FROM LLOYDS BANK WHICH SAYS THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT EXPECT TRADE TO PICK UP OVER THE COMING MONTHS HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THREE YEARS THIS CAN'T ALL BE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM RESULT AS IT SO WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS FACTORS WHICH ARE HITTING CORPORATE CONFIDENCE I THINK THAT THE REFEREE MISSED HE'S PROBABLY PUTTING DECISIONS ON HAULED IN TERMS OF HIRING PLANS AND INVESTMENTS
THAT THAT WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A SHORT TERM IMPACT TO MEAN THE U.K.'S IS VULNERABLE TO UNCERTAINTY NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE RUN A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH IS ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF G.D.P.
AND A SMART CAR AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WE NEED THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS TO FUND THIS AND THESE FOREIGN INVESTORS COULD BE DETERRENT IF IF THE YUKI IS FACED WITH YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY FOLLOWING ANY EXIT FROM EUROPE AS TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE RENEGOTIATED SO DON'T THINK YOU CAN UNDERESTIMATE THE SHORT TERM VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY THAT AFFECTS COMPANIES AT THE MOMENT OH KAY THANKS LAURA FROM INVEST TAKE WEALTH AND INVESTMENT IF YOU'RE A FAN
OF BRITISH ASPARAGUS GOOD NEWS THE PRICE OF THEIR DELICACY IS EXPECTED TO FALL THANKS TO THE WEATHER GROWERS SAY THE RECENT WARM SPELL HAS QUICKLY RIPENED THE CROP SO SUPERMARKETS ARE PREPARING FOR A GLUT OF IT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ECONOMISTS DICTATE ECONOMICS DICTATE THE PRICE SHOULD THEREFORE THOUGHT THAT'S GREAT FOR FOOD LOVERS NOT SO GOOD FOR FARMERS OF COURSE CHRISTIAN IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASPARAGUS GROWERS ASSOCIATION MORNING CHRIS GOOD MORNING JUST EXPLAIN THE WEATHER COLLECTION FOR US
WE HAD A WEIRD ONE THIS YEAR VERY WARM WINTER FOLLOWED BY PRETTY AVERAGE SPRING FOLLOWED BY SOME VERY WARM WEATHER IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SO AT A LATE SPRING MEANT THAT WE WERE WAITING AND WAITING FOR THE CROP TO EMERGE AND NOW IT'S SORT OF COME AT ONCE RIGHT AND SO WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FOR THE THE AMOUNT OF ASPARAGUS WHICH WILL BE HITTING THE SUPERMARKET SHELVES AND THEREFORE THE PRICE
WELL HOPEFULLY YOU SHOULDN'T FAIL BUT BUMP INTO ASPARAGUS WHEN YOU WALK INTO A SUPERMARKET AND OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE DO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO PICK UP A BUNDLE AND I THINK THAT YOU WILL SEE AT THE ASPARAGUS PRICE AS AS GOOD AS IT'S GOING TO GET ON THE PRODUCT IS AS GOOD AS IT'S EVER GOING TO GET TO BRITISH ASPARAGUS IS OF COURSE RENOWNED ACROSS THE WORLD FOR BEING THE MOST FLAVOURSOME SO PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BUY IT NOT GREAT FOR GROWERS OF ASPARAGUS
IT'S PRETTY CHALLENGING EVERY YEAR'S DIFFERENT AND ASPARAGUS REALLY FOLLOWS WHERE THE TRENDS MORE THAN ANY OTHER CROP IS A VERY EARLY SPRING VEGETABLE SO WE'RE ALWAYS FACED WITH CHALLENGES ARE THE VERY EARLY OR VERY LATE OR VERY PEAKY PRODUCTION IS LIKE A LITTLE THERMOMETER GROWS FROM ABOUT TEN DEGREES AND
CAN GROW QUICKER AND QUICKER UP TO ABOUT THIRTY DEGREES GROWING A SPEAR SPIRIT DAY AT PEAK SO RIGHT WE ARE USED TO THE SORT OF UM PICKY NATURE OF IT AND IF I DECIDE TO FILM MY FRIDGE WITH SOME RELATIVELY CHEAP ASPARAGUS WHAT'S THE TOP RECIPE YOU RECOMMEND

THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN AS WE WERE HEARING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON ENERGY BILLS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE TODAY NORMA SMITH OUR SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR IS ON THE LINE AND BASICALLY SAYING THEY CAN MAKE THEM CHEAPER BUT WHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS ARGUMENT WON IT IS TECHNICALLY TRUE YES OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. WE COULD DETERMINE OUR OWN V.A.T. RATES AND YES WE COULD GET RID OF V.A.T. ON FUEL
I THINK A FEW EYEBROWS WILL BE RAISED HEAVENWARDS THAT ANY CHANCELLOR WILL BE WILLING TO FOREGO THAT SORT OF INCOME GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE DEFICIT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ALSO IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT WE CAN ALREADY WITHIN EXISTING E.U. RULES CUT A V.A.T. BY SOMETHING LIKE FIVE PER CENT FROM TWENTY PERCENT TO FIFTEEN PERCENT AND LASTLY IT WAS AFTER ALL A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT NOT THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH SLAP V.A.T. ON DOMESTIC FUEL THAT SAID WHAT I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS PLEDGE
IS IT TELLS US THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN I THINK NOW VIEW THEIR ROUTE TO VICTORY AS THROUGH THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN THAT IS WHERE THEIR PITCH NOW IS APPEALING TO A LESS AFFLUENT VOTERS SAYING IN TERMS THAT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF YOUR WAGES WOULD BE HIGHER THEY SAY BECAUSE BRUSSELS IS RUN BY BIG BUSINESS MULTINATIONALS WANT TO KEEP YOUR WAGES DOWN BY BRINGING IN MIGRANT LABOUR AND
IT'S ARGUED YOUR TAXES WOULD ALSO BE LOWER BY BEING ABLE TO GET LOWER V.A.T. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S A REGRESSIVE TAX WHICH IMPACTS MORE ON LESS AFFLUENT BOTOX YOU MENTION BIG BUSINESS THERE REMAIN
TALKING TODAY ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND INTERESTINGLY CLAIMING THEM FOR THEIR OWN THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SUPPLY COMPONENTS BITS AND PIECES SERVICES TO BIG COMPANIES WHO DO EXPORT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION ACTUALLY THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DEPENDENT ON OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. IS MUCH HIGHER THEY CALCULATED AT ONE POINT TWO
MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOYING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT'S ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF ALL S.M.E.S WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS THOTH FEROCITY OF THE REACTION OF THE LEAVE SIDE TO THOSE ASSERTIONS THEY ACCUSE THE REMAIN SIDE OF PEDDLING QUOTES FALSE FIGURES AND THEY LAUNCH A HIGHLY PERSONAL ATTACK ON SUCH JAB WITH THE BUSINESS SECRETARIES PUTTING OUT THAT ARGUMENT DESCRIBING HIM AS A LATTERDAY PRO BRUSSELS CAMPAIGN
JOHN LONGWORTH YOU SPEAKING ON THEIR BEHALF SAS I HOPE THAT SUCH A JOB HIS PRIORITY IS NOT HIS POLITICAL CAREER RATHER THAN HELPING BRITISH BUSINESS AND THE SENSE I GET JUSTIN IS AFTER WEEKS WHEN THE LEE SIDE HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH SLUMPED IN A CORNER TAKING A PUMMELLING OVER THE ECONOMY THEY ARE NOW BACK ON THE FRONT FOOT THEY'VE GOT A CLEAR SORT OF AGENDA WHICH IS TO PUSH THIS SORT OF WORKING MAN WORKING WOMAN AGENDA AND ARE MUCH MORE PERSONALISED AND AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN
WE'LL HEAR FROM TWO SMALL COMPANY BOSSES LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME BOTH OF EM DO EXPORT TO EUROPE WITH DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO COPE WITH E.U. REGULATIONS NOVEL FOR THE TIME BEING THANKS VERY MUCH

AND A TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND LOOK AT THE PAPERS IN THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE TIMES AS MINISTERS IGNORED RISK OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKING IT'S MONK SEVERAL PAPERS TO REPORT THAT THE DANGER OF MIGRANTS BEING SMUGGLED ILLEGALLY INTO BRITAIN ON BOUGHT SMALL BOATS WAS JUDGED NOT SIGNIFICANT BY THE HOME OFFICE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THIS WAS DESPITE AN INDEPENDENT REPORT IN JANUARY WHICH HEAVILY CRITICISED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY AROUND THE U.K.'S COASTS THERE'S ANGER IN THE DAILY MAIL ABOUT THE SITUATION WHICH IT DESCRIBES AS THE U.K.'S OPEN COASTLINE SHAMBLES THE PAPER SAYS THAT THEY'VE BEEN FOREWARNING SINCE TWENTY TEN ABOUT A LACK OF BORDER SECURITY AT SMALL PORTS AND AIRFIELDS ITS LEADER ACCUSES THE HOME OFFICE OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM WITH BREATHTAKING COMPLACENCY
THE DAILY EXPRESS ASKS WHAT IS THE POINT OF SUBJECTING TRAVELLERS TO EVER MORE CHECKS AT PORTS AND AIRPORTS OF BRITAIN'S COAST IS UNDEFENDED MIRROR WARNS OF THE MIGRANTS WHO TRIED TO CROSS THE BUSY SHIPPING LANES IN THE CHANNEL COULD BE KILLED IF THEIR BOAT COLLIDES WITH THE LARGER VESSEL THEY'RE QUITS GOVERNMENT FIGURES SHOW THAT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED COMMERCIAL SHIPS USED THE DOVER STRAITS EVERY DAY UNDER THE HEADLINE ACT NOW TO STOP HORROR THE PAPER'S OPINION COLUMN ARGUES
PATROLLED BY THE ROYAL NAVY IN BORDER FOR SHIP SHOULD BE STEPPED UP EFFORTS MADE TO DISCOURAGE MIGRANTS FROM SETTING OUT ON THE HAZARDOUS SEA CROSSING THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTS ON WHAT IT CALLS FOOTBALL'S SILENT SHAME IT SAYS THERE ARE CALLS FOR THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION TO INVESTIGATE THE LINK BETWEEN THE SPORT AND DEMENTIA ACCORDING TO THE PAPER FOUR OF THE EIGHT SURVIVING OUTFIELD PLAYERS FROM ENGLAND'S NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WORLD CUP WINNING SQUAD NOW SUFFER SIGNIFICANT MEMORY PROBLEMS
THE TELEGRAPH EXPLAINS THAT REPEATED HEADING OF THE BALL AND COLLISIONS DURING GAMES ARE BEING SEEN AS POSSIBLY LINKED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEGENERATIVE BRAIN CONDITIONS IN SOME FORMER PLAYERS AND F.A. SPOKESMAN IS QUOTED SAYING THAT THE ORGANISATION IS WORKING EXTENSIVELY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HEAD INJURIES UNUSUALLY THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS A SPORT STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE THAT OF COURSE OF ALISTAIR COOKE BECOMING THE YOUNGEST EVER CRICKETER TO SCORE TEN THOUSAND TEST MATCH RUNS US IT HAS A PICTURE OF THE ENGLAND CAPTAIN CELEBRATING HIS TEAM'S VICTORY IN THE SAME TEST AGAINST SRI LANKA YESTERDAY

THE TIME JUST COME OUT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING IRAQ'S ELITE SPECIAL FORCES HAVE BEEN LEADING THE ADVANCE ON FALLUJAH THEY TRIED TO SEIZE BACK CONTROL OF THE CITY WHICH HAS BEEN CONTROLLED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS JUST OVER THREE WEEKS TO GO TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN THE LATEST OF A SERIES OF FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WERE IN GLASGOW THIS MORNING WHEN JIM IS GAUGING OPINION MORNING JIM
GOOD MORNING TO YOU MICHELLE FROM GLASGOW UNDER THE CHINA BLUE SKY HERE AND WE'LL BE GIVING YOU SOME THOUGHTS THROUGH THE PROGRAMME ON THE REFERENDUM NORTH OF THE BORDER BECAUSE THAT IS OF COURSE AN EXTRA DIMENSION
THE ARGUMENT HERE WHERE THE OTHER REFERENDUM AFTER ALL WASN'T VERY LONG AGO IT IS OF COURSE THE NATIONAL QUESTION WITH TWO YOUNG VOTERS HERE IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW ELOISE RANG HARD
EIGHTEEN AND AND BLOCKLEY WHO'S ALSO EIGHTEEN THEY'RE INVOLVED INCIDENTALLY IN THE B. B. C. A GENERATION YOUNG VOTER GROUPS NOW ELOISE YOU'RE AN S.N.P. VOTER AND YOU'RE VOTING TO REMAIN
I JUST FEEL THAT IF WE WERE TO COME OUT OF THE YEAR THAT WE WOULD LOSE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THAT ESPECIALLY WITH ENTRY FOR SOUTHERN INST P. AND TO EUROPE INTO THE TRADE AGREEMENT I THINK THAT
WE GOT AT THE TABLE AND IT WOULD JUST BE IT'S TOO MUCH OF A REST GREAT NO RIGHT YOU IN YOUR EIGHTEEN SAME AS ELOISE YOU'RE SAYING
I BELIEVE AND SOVEREIGNTY I BELIEVE AND DEMOCRATIC WELL AND I ALSO BELIEVE IN ECONOMIC PRUDENCE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE GET THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS AWAY A WEEK
I THINK THAT YOU CAN CALL UP AUGUST THANK YOU WILL SEE A LOT A YOU'VE GOT ME THIS COLONY THE BOGUS FIGURES THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE CROSS PARTY INCLUDING SOME LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WHO SAY IT'S IN TWO THOUSAND FLEECE AT THE EURO WAS A GOOD IDEA SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE TAKEN ANY LECTURES FROM THEM BUT OF COURSE IN THERE
I BELIEVE THAT TWO HUNDRED AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION THEN I THINK WAS THE NET'S FIGURE AND I WANT THAT MONEY TO BE SPENT IN SCOTLAND THAN IN THE U.K. RIGHT I MENTIONED THEY HAD IT IN INTRODUCING THE TWO OF YOU THE NATIONAL QUESTION WHICH OF COURSE IS A LIFE HERE THE REFERENDUM
THE DECISIVE VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE U.K. NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO BUT IT'S NONETHELESS A LIFE QUESTION HOW DOES IT PLAY IT IN YOUR MIND ELOISE FOR EXAMPLE IF BRITAIN AS IF THE U.K. AS A WHOLE VOTED TO LEAVE WOULD YOU WANT A SECOND REFERENDUM
ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SCOTLAND I THINK WE WERE LIKE TWO A LOT DURING THE REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND IN AN E. YOU WAS BROUGHT UP AS SUCH I BEG YOU NOT TO BE IN THE YEAR YOU'RE NOT THERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN AND OTHER WORDS THAT THE ARGUMENT WAS IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U.
WHICH A MAJORITY OF SCOTS APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO ALL THE POLES DO YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE NO AGAINST INDEPENDENCE THAT WAS SAID TWO YEARS AGO YEAH ABSOLUTELY THAT WAS THAT WAS SUCH A MAJOR ARGUMENT FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHERE UNDER SADIE'S UP UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE SO YOU WOULD WANT A SECOND REFERENDUM IN YOU WOULD VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE KNOWING THAT IT WOULD MEAN TAKING ON THE EURO AS IT WOULD IF YOU WERE STAYING IN EUROPE
YEAH ABSOLUTELY I'M A STRONGLY AND EUROPE I THINK IT'S AS IT'S A PETITION THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S SUPPORTED A LOT OF SMALLER COUNTRIES RIGHT EWAN WHY DO YOU HOW DO YOU THINK THE THE ARGUMENT OVER THE INDEPENDENCE AND SCOTLAND'S POSITION IN THE U.K.
THAT FEEDS INTO THE EUROPEAN DEBATE AND I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT DOES I THINK WE VOTED TO REMAIN PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM I THINK WE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT FORWARD IN FAVOUR OF THE UNION AND WERE REPORTING
TO COME OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR STAY AND HOPEFULLY COME OUT AND MY STANCE AS A UNITED KINGDOM ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT THE CONSERVATIVES NOW THE SECOND PARTY IN HOLLYWOOD OF COURSE UNDER RUTH DID ARE ARGUING OF COURSE THAT IT'S NOT A UNANIMOUS VIEW IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WERE AMONG THE VOTERS BUT NONETHELESS A PARTY AS A WHOLE IS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY MORE CONVINCED
ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS FOR REMAIN THEN THAT THE PARTY AS A WHOLE IN THE U.K. THAT THE SPLIT IS IS IS LESS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT WOULDN'T YOU I WOULD DISAGREE I'M A CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBER ACTUALLY N. SCOTLAND THAT I BELIEVE THAT
THAT IS A LOT MORE HUSHED UP TOP PEOPLE A LOT HUSHED UP YES I WOULD SAY THAT A LOT EM ES PEASE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THAT EXIT MORE GO AND BOUGHT IT BUT I AM WILLING TO GO AGAINST RUTH AND THE TEAM WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK ELOISE THE GENERAL FEELING IS HERE AMONG PEOPLE OF YOUR GENERATION AND OF COURSE IT IS WORTH REMINDING PEOPLE OUTSIDE SCOTLAND THAT YOU HAD VOTES IN THE REFERENDUM ALTHOUGH YOU WEREN'T YETI TEAM BECAUSE SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD THAT GILL HAD VOTE IN THAT
I THINK ESPECIALLY AMONG MY GENERATION I THINK THAT
IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STAY WITH EM I WILL IF I CONTEND WITH JOBS ESPECIALLY MY AGE ROLE EVEN SCHOOL AND LOOKING FOR JOBS AND THERE WAS ASSESSING MELODY SOMETHING ABOUT ONE IN TEN JOBS ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. DO YOU BELIEVE
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE WERE ASKING ABOUT THE BOGUS FAKE FIGURE THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DO YOU BELIEVE ALL THE SCARE STUFF BECAUSE OF COURSE IN THE
SCOTTISH REFERENDUM ITSELF YOU ASIDE ARGUED THAT THAT WAS PROJECT FEAR WHEN GEORGE OSBORNE SAID ALL THESE THINGS YOU SING YOU KNOW BELIEVE THAT IN THIS REFERENDUM YOU BELIEVE THIS WHAT THE OTHER SIDE'S HERE SCARE STORIES ABOUT IT
PROJECT FEAR BUT YOU COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM BELIEVE SITES ABLE SEEN PROJECT FEEL AGAIN
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE WHAT'S BEING SAID AND PROJECTS THE OTHER STEAK DON'T YOU YEAH I THINK I THINK THERE'S BEEN SO MANY MIXED MESSAGES FROM THE U.K. GOVERNMENT I THINK IT WAS REALLY IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE VOTER WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE GEORGE OSBORNE
I DON'T BELIEVE GEORGE OSBORNE AS MUCH SORT OF LEAVE TONY BLAIR WITH THE EURO IN TWO THOUSAND FEET YOU BELIEVE GEORGE OSBORNE IN THE SCOTS FOR A FRIEND I I DON'T BELIEVE THEM BUT THESE ARE MY ABLE HEAVE THEM SHE DIDN'T AND SHE NOW BELIEVES THEM YOU DID AND YOU KNOW DON'T YOU SEE THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT DEFINITELY DEAFENING VIEWERS BUT I THINK WITH GEORGE OSBORNE IS GET THE STATISTICS THIS TIME FROM THE C.B.I. AND FROM
INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY FUNDED BY LIKE LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING IS THIS AN ARGUMENT FOR YOU ABOUT FISH
IN EUROPE THAT BELIEF IN EUROPE OR IS IT AN ARGUMENT BASED ON LOOKING AT FIGURES WHICH HAS
FIFTH ESSENTIALLY I THINK ESPECIALLY FROM A GENERATION I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE FACTS AND FIGURES AND I'M REALLY INTERESTED I THINK THAT'S SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL FOR AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD JUST LEAVING SCHOOL I THINK A LOT OF OUR GENERATION HAS NOT IN GLASGOW AND THE SAME I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE FACTS AND FIGURES IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE BELIEVE ME IT'S IN YOUR GUT ABSOLUTELY I'M BRITISH ABLE EVEN BETTER NOW BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD GOVERN OURSELVES
JUST ONE LAST THING YOU YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS MAYBE SOME IN COMMON I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BOTH IN GLASGOW WHO DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO CARRY THE DAY IN SCOTLAND LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT SCOTLAND
WHO'S GOING TO WIN HE AS DEFINITELY REMAIN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT YOU'VE GOT NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT NO
THEN YOU CALL THAT BACK YOU AS AS AN OPTIMIST I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE HAS A CHANCE OF BEING ON A STREET STALL YESTERDAY I BELIEVE THAT ONCE PEOPLE LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS THAT LEVER PRESENTING THAT THERE BE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE RATHER THAN THE SIGHTS
AND BLOCKLEY ELOISE RHINEHART HERE IN THE CENTRE OF GLASGOW WILL BE BACK WITH YOU IN AN HOUR BUT FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY STAY LISTENING COS YOU'RE A FAMOUS BEEKEEPER AND WE HAVE VERY IMPORTANT NEWS FROM THE WORLD OF BEES COMING UP NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S A MYSTERIOUS WORLD AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT BEES COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLOWERS BASED ON THEIR MAGNETIC FIELDS RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL WHO MADE THAT DISCOVERY HAVE NOW ADDED TO THEIR RESEARCH DOCTOR GREGORY SUTTON IS ON THE LINE THE ROYAL SOCIETY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FELLOW AT BRISTOL IS LED ALL THE RESEARCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND IT IS YOU NEED TO SAY THAT THAT DISCOVERY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH MAGNETIC FIELDS IS OLD HAT YOU MADE IT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHAT HAVE YOU ADDED TO IT NOW SO THREE YEARS AGO WE DISCOVERED THAT BEES CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLOWERS BASED ON THEIR ELECTRIC FIELD NOT A MAGNETIC FIELD AND THERE WAS THE OPEN QUESTION OF HOW WERE THEY DOING IT HOW WERE THEY SENSING ELECTRIC FIELD
AND WHAT WE JUST RELEASED YESTERDAY IS THAT THE WAY THEY'RE DETECTING ELECTRIC FIELD AS THAT THE HAIRS ON THE BOBBIES BUDDY ARE ACTUALLY BENDING IN REACTION TO ELECTRIC FIELDS AND WE CAN MEASURE THE BAND AND DETECT THE SIGNAL THAT THAT BENDING HERE IS SENDING BACK TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
HEART WHAT IS HAPPENING THEN WHEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHAT WHAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WORK SO SO I'M GOING TO DATE MYSELF HE IS DID YOU EVER PUT YOUR ARM UP ON THOSE AGAINST ONE OF THOSE ALL THE GLASS TELEVISION SETS OH YEAH AND WHEN YOU PUT YOUR ARM UP AND THE ODD GLASS TELEVISION SET YOU'RE HERE ISN'T IT IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING ONLY MUCH SMALLER
THE ELECTRIC FIELD THERE FROM THE FLOWER IS MUCH MUCH SMALLER AND THE HAIRS ARE MUCH SMALLER AND FINER BUT IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING HAVE THE HAIRS ON THE BEES ARE BEING BURNT ARE BEING MOVED BY THE ELECTRIC FIELD AND THAT ALLOWS THE BEE TO ACTUALLY MEASURE THE ELECTRIC FIELD WHEN I USE THE TERM MAGNETIC FIELD IS THAT JUST IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH MAGNUS ISN'T IT IS IT IS IT IS THE ROLE OF ELECTRICITY IT'S THE ELECTRIC FIELD IT'S A STATIC ELECTRICITY TO FIELD THE EASIEST WAY TO GENERATE ONE OF THESE IS EASY IF YOU HAVE A BALLOON AND YOU RUB MY BACK YOUR HEAD
THAT'S THE TIBER FIELD THAT FLOWER GENERATOR JUST A VERY VERY SMALL WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE THE CASE IF IT'S HAPPENS WITH BEES THAT IT HAPPENS WITH OTHER
FURRY INSECTS THAT'S WHAT I SUSPECT THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY VERY FUZZY INSECTS FROM THERE A FUNNY MASK FUZZY BUTTERFLIES AS WELL AS THERE ARE SPIDERS IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE BACK OF A TARANTULA THE TRENCH WAS ABDOMEN IS COVERED WITH THESE FINE HAIRS AND THESE HAIRS ARE VERY VERY MECHANICALLY SENSITIVE TO WIND CURRENTS BUT I SUSPECT THAT THERE THERE THEY'RE SENSITIVE IN THE SAME WAY TO ELECTRIC FIELDS AS WELL
WHICH IS WOOD AND OTHER ANIMALS AS WELL TO HAVING HIS OWN FISH
SO IT'S BEEN A LONG KNOWN THAT MANY FISH CAN DETECT ELECTRIC FIELDS THEY USE A DIFFERENT MECHANISM THEY USE A SMALL ORGAN THAT ACTUALLY CREATES AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ELECTRIC FIELD
A DIFFERENT THEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING THEMSELVES THERE AND THOSE WERE AT THOSE HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR A YOUNG SAGES IT'S THE VIC BUT THIS HAIR MECHANISM IS SOMETHING NEW THAT WE'VE ONLY DISCOVERED RECENTLY AMAZING AND WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT THEN WHERE WHERE WILL THIS RESEARCH TAKE YOU KNOW THE NEXT QUESTION IS EXACTLY THE QUESTION YOU ASKED WE WANT TO FIND OUT IF BUMBLEBEES ARE SPECIAL
OR IF THIS IS A GENERAL THING ACROSS SO MANY INSECTS AND SPIDERS AND SCORPIONS AND IS THERE AN ENTIRE ELECTROSTATIC WORLD THAT UP UNTIL NOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING AT IN INSECTS WHICH HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY IF THAT IS THE CASE
I WILL I WOULD THINK IT'D BE FANTASTIC AND THE ABILITY TO JUST TALK ABOUT INSECTS BEING SO FUZZY IS GREAT FUN YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS THE OBVIOUSLY DO THAT A GREGORY SUTTON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL THANKS FROM
THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN IRAQI FORCES ARE SLOWLY ADVANCING TOWARDS FOR LEADER OF THE CITY HELD BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IT'S ONLY THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE BAGHDAD AND IT'S WHERE U.S. FORCES SUFFERED SEVERE LOSSES WHEN THEY TRY TO ROOT OUT SUNNI INSURGENTS IN TWO THOUSAND FOR COLONEL DEREK HARVEY FORMER U.S. INTELLIGENCE ANALYST WAS INVOLVED IN PLANNING THAT OPERATION AND SAYS THE ADVANCE INSIDE THE CITY WILL BE PARALLEL
THE HOUSE TO HOUSE CAM BAD IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT'S GOING TO BOOBY TRAP THERE'S GOING BE TUNNELS YOU'LL BE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE FIRING POSITIONS
I'LL BE TUNNELS BETWEEN POSITIONS AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ROOT OUT THE REMAINING ITIS FREIGHTERS THERE COULD NUMBER BETWEEN ONE AND TWO THOUSAND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY LENA FATIGUE WHO'S THE HEAD OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PROGRAMME AT CHATHAM HOUSE GOOD MORNING MORNING HOW DIFFICULT DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BE TWO DECISIVELY TAKE THE LEAD
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT NOT ONLY AYE AYE WE ARE GOING TO FACE HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF OUR TUNNELS ARE ET-CETERA BUT ALSO
THESE FIGHTERS INSIDE FOOD ALSO HAVE FAMILIES WHO ARE FROM FOR A LODGER THERE ARE NOW AROUND ONE TO TWO THOUSAND AYE AYE S. FIGHTERS WHO ARE IRAQI AND COME FROM THAT CITY
IF THESE PEOPLE ARE UNDER ATTACK THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE LIKELY TO RALLY AROUND THEM SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN ADDITION TO THE MILITARY CHALLENGES SO THEY ARE THEY WILL SEE THIS AS A BATTLE AGAINST OUTSIDERS TRYING TO TAKE OVER THEIR HOME GROUND
YES ABSOLUTELY I MEAN FELLOW IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST CITIES THAT I S. TOOK OVER IN IRAQ AND IT COULD ONLY DO THAT WITH THE CO OPERATION OF THE LOCAL POPULATION AND HERE WE HAVE TO ROW BACK AND THINK WHY DID THESE PEOPLE ALLY THEMSELVES WITH THE I S. AND THE FIRST PLACE THE ISSUE IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THE GRIEVANCES OF A SECTARIAN NATURE THESE PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE SIR ME
THEY SAW THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AS BEING DOMINATED AND DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM AND I WAS A CONVENIENT WAY TO EXACT REVENGE ON THIS GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS WHY THE FIGHT IS GOING TO BE SO FIERCE BECAUSE IT IS VERY MUCH AN EXISTENTIAL BATTLE AND THAT SECTARIAN DIMENSION ALSO AFFECTS THE THE SUPPORT THAT IRAQI FORCES
ARE GETTING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION WE WERE HEARING FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD A MOMENT AGO HE SAID THAT THE THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE VERY WARY OF BEING SEEN IT'S WAR PLANES BEING SEEN TO TO SUPPORT ANY EFFORT ON THE GROUND THAT IS FROM THE SHIA MILITIA SIDE
YES THE U.S. MAY BE WARY ABOUT THIS HOWEVER THE REALITY ON THE GROUND IS THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING THIS YARN MILITIAS ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS A FIGHT AGAINST A YES AND OF COURSE IF IF ONE IS A SUNNI SYMPATHISE TOO AH YES AND THEY ARE SUING SHIA MILITIAS
COME INTO THEIR CITY THIS WILL ONLY AGGRAVATE SECTARIAN TENSIONS AND EVEN FOR THOSE WHO I'M NOT SYMPATHETIC TO A YES AGAIN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE SHIA MILITIAS IN PREVIOUS BATTLES IN THE IRAQ HOUSE THEN LESS THAN STANDARD THEY HAVE ENGAGED
VERY ARE YOU NO WHAT DO YOU THINK OUR ACTIONS THESE KNEES SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU REMEMBER SOME IS WHAT I'M NOT SYMPATHETIC TO A YES I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS OLD LIBERATION THAT THEY HANDS OFF SHE A MALICIOUS AND IN THE MEANTIME AMIDST ALL OF THIS THAT THE POSITION OF OF CIVILIANS YOU SOME OTHERS BUT SOME OF THAT THOSE INSIDE PUBS THE FAMILIES HAVE I AS FIGHTER SOME OF THEM NOT
YES I MEAN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLY TRAPPED IN THE CITY AND THIS PEOPLE I'M GOING TO LOSE THEIR LIVELIHOODS AS A RESULT OF THIS OFFERED SERVED THEY ARE GOING TO PROBABLY LOSE THEIR HOMES MATERIALLY THEY ARE GOING TO BE INTERNALLY DISPLACED IN IRAQ ARE AS I SAID THIS PEOPLE I SENT YOU AND THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE DISTRUST AND EITHER AREAS WHERE ALREADY AS I SAY
VICTORY AND TENSIONS ARE HIGH I'LL PROBABLY END UP IN KURDISH AREAS WHERE THEY WERE FACE ABOVE A KIND OF ATTENTION OF AN ETHNIC NATURE UNFORTUNATELY IF IRAQI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH IT INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS LENA HAD TEA FROM CHATHAM HOUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN WHOSE CARE WERE SCRUTINISED IN THIS AUDIT HAVE TYPE ONE DIABETES WHICH MEANS THEY CANNOT PRODUCE INSULIN ANTHONY DAILY INJECTIONS DOCTORS FROM THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH POINT OUT THERE'S A GROWING PROPORTION OF CHILDREN ARE ACHIEVING EXCELLENT CONTROL OF THEIR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS HOWEVER ONLY A QUARTER WERE RECORDED AS RECEIVING ALL SEVEN RECOMMENDED ANNUAL CHECKS THESE GIVE VITAL EARLY WARNING OF POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS FROM DIABETES
THE AUTHOR SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE SOME OF THE CHECKS SIMPLY WEREN'T ENTERED ONTO COMPUTER SYSTEMS BUT OTHERS WERE MISSED ALTOGETHER THE REPORT FOUND A WORRYINGLY HIGH LEVEL OF YOUNG PEOPLE MORE THAN TEN PER CENT WERE ALREADY SHOWING AN INCREASED RISK OF KIDNEY DISEASE OR BLINDNESS
THE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ABUSED AT THE WINTERBOURNE VIEW CARE HOME HAVE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER TO DAVID CAMERON SAYING THEY'RE ANGRY THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN PAINFULLY SLOW FIVE YEARS AGO THE B.B.C. PANORAMA PROGRAMME EXPOSED BULLYING AND MISTREATMENT AT THE PRIVATE HOSPITAL NEAR BRISTOL WHICH HAS NOW BEEN CLOSED AND H. S. ENGLAND SAYS THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT ACCEPTS PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN QUICK ENOUGH
LEADING FIGURES IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SCRAP A V.A.T. ON FUEL TO HELP THE POOREST HOUSEHOLDS CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR POLITICIANS HAVE WRITTEN A JOINT ARTICLE IN THE SUN NEWSPAPER SAYING THE TAX ON ENERGY BILLS IS UNFAIR BUT THAT IT CAN'T BE SCRAPPED BECAUSE OF E.U. RULES IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATSON
YESTERDAY FEARFUL NOT ENOUGH LABOUR SUPPORTERS WILL VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. ARE CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER PROMISED THAT CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP WOULD PROTECT WORKERS' RIGHTS TODAY THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS FIGHTING FOR THE SAME VOTERS CONSERVATIVES MICHAEL GORE THAN BORIS JOHNSON
ALONG WITH LABOUR'S GIVES THE STUARTS CLAIMING THAT WAGES WOULD GO UP AFTER BREAKS IT AND THAT FUEL BILLS WOULD BE LOWER FOR EVERYONE THEY POINT OUT UNDER E.U. RULES V.A.T. ON GAS AND ELECTRICITY BILLS CAN'T BE WAS DRAWN BUT THE CRITICS WOULD SAY THAT AS ITS MINISTERS ARE NOT CAMPAIGNS AT THE SATO PUBLIC MONEY IS SPENT
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A FUTURE GOVERNMENT WOULD SCRAP FOR V.A.T. EVEN WAS THE FREEDOM TO DO SO AND THAT IT WAS A PREVIOUS CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION WHICH ABOLISHED ZERO RATE OF V.A.T. ON DOMESTIC ENERGY BILLS
REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED THE IDEA OF SCRAPPING V.A.T. ON FUEL AS FANTASY LAND ECONOMICS AND SAYS IT WILL SET OUT A REPORT LATER TODAY THE CHALLENGE WHAT IT CALLS UNAFFORDABLE SPENDING COMMITMENTS BY THOSE IN FAVOUR OF BRECK'S IT REMAIN GROUP IS FOCUSING ON BUSINESS SAYING NEARLY A QUARTER OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED FIRMS RELY ON TRADE WITH THE E.U.
AN AUSTRALIAN FAMILY THREATENED WITH BEING DEPORTED FROM THE U.K. HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY CAN STAY IN SCOTLAND UNTIL AUGUST BUT THEY'VE HAD THEIR RIGHT TO WORK WITHDRAWN THE BRAIN FAMILY FACED BEING DEPORTED BECAUSE THE VISA SCHEME THAT ATTRACTED THEM TO THE HIGHLANDS WERE SCRAPPED BY THE GOVERNMENT HE'S DAN JOHNSON
GREGAN CATHERINE BRAIN MOVED FROM AUSTRALIA TO DINGWALL IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS WITH THEIR SON LACKLAND WHEN HE WAS JUST A TODDLER FIVE YEARS ON GAELIC IS HIS FIRST LANGUAGE BUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE VISA DESIGNED TO ATTRACT HIGHLY SKILLED STUDENTS TO STAY ON WORKING IN SCOTLAND MEANT THE FAMILY FACED BEEN SENT BACK IF THEY DIDN'T FIND JOBS THAT MEAT HOME OFFICE CRITERIA
NOW THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER HAS OFFERED A TEMPORARY REPRIEVE TWO MONTHS FOR THEM TO FIND SUITABLE WORK
THEIR M.P. THE S.N.P. N. AND BLACKFORD HAS BEEN ARGUING THEIR CASE
THE HOME OFFICE MAINTAINS THE FAMILY HAS SO FAR FAILED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A RELEVANT JOB OFFER IN LINE WITH IMMIGRATION RULES THEIR BRAINS NOW HAVE SIXTY DAYS TO DO THAT
CEREMONIES WILL BE HELD IN ORKNEY AND AT SEA TODAY TO COMMEMORATE THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND BRITISH SAILORS AND MARINES AND TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND GERMANS DIED IN THE LARGEST NAVAL CLASH OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR FROM ORKNEY NICK HIGHAM REPORTS
THE ROYAL NAVY'S GRAND FLEET SAILED OUT TO MEET THE GERMAN HIGH SEAS FLEET FROM THE GREAT NATURAL ANCHORAGE OF SCAPA FLOW IN ORKNEY AND IT'S HERE THAT THE BATTLE WILL BE REMEMBERED THERE'LL BE A SERVICE AT SAINT MAGNUS CATHEDRAL IN THE ORKNEY CAPITAL OF KIRKWALL IN THE AFTERNOON A CEREMONY AT THE NAVAL CEMETERY AT LINUS ON THE ISLAND OF HOY TO THE SOUTH OF SCAPA FLOW
ACROSS THE NORTH SEA MODERN BRITISH AND GERMAN WARSHIPS WILL SCATTER SYMBOLS OF REMEMBRANCE ON THE WATERS OF THE JUTLAND BANK ABOVE THE WRECKS OF SHIPS SUNK IN THE BATTLE THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH A SERVING NAVAL OFFICER IN WORLD WAR TWO HAD BEEN DUE TO ATTEND THE CEREMONIES IN ORKNEY BUT PULLED OUT ON MEDICAL ADVICE THE PRINCESS ROYAL THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE GERMAN PRESIDENT YOLK GUG ARE STILL EXPECTED
THAT WAS NICK I REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CLAIM THIS MORNING FROM THE REMAIN CAMP IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE IS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF WE STAYED IN THE UNION THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SURGEON JAR RED'S GOING TO CLAIM THAT MANY OF THEM RELY ON BUSINESS WITH THE E.U. EVEN IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY EXPORT THEIR THEMSELVES THEY SUPPLY FIRMS THAT DO
THE LEAF SIDE OF POINTED OUT THE PAST THAT IN DIRECT TERMS MOST SMALLER COMPANIES DON'T DO BUSINESS ANY HOPES THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID E.U. REGULATIONS AND RULES WE'RE NOT TO BE MEMBERS LOUISE STUART IS ON THE LINE FROM THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST AND YOU'RE NEUTRAL IN THIS TO BACK WE ARE WE'VE MAINTAINED OUR NEUTRALITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A VAST BODY OF MEMBERS AND PEOPLE FEEL DIFFERENTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
MANY WOULD LIKE TO STAY OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE IN FACT THE FIGURES SHOW THAT AROUND WHEN WE DID RESEARCH FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF MEMBERS WOULD VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. FORTY POINT NINE WOULD VOTE TO LEAVE ELEVEN PERCENT UNDECIDED SO IT'S FAIRLY SPLIT AND THESE FIGURES ARE SALVAGE I WAS GOING TO USE TODAY THAT ONE POINT TWO MILLION
BUSINESS IS NOT NECESSARILY THEMSELVES DOING BUSINESS WITH EUROPE BUT DOING BUSINESS WITH OTHER BUSINESSES THAT DO DO BUSINESS IN OTHER WORDS VERY DEPENDENT ON THAT TRADING IS THAT ROUGHLY DO YOU THINK OF A REASONABLE NUMBER YES I THINK SO WE FOUND TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF F.S.B. MEMBERS EXPORT THEIR GOODS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO ABROAD BUT THERE
LARGE NUMBER OF THAT IS TO EUROPE'S AROUND EIGHTY TWO PER CENT OF THOSE EXPORTING IS TO EUROPE SO IT'S UNDER A QUARTER OF OUR MEMBERS BUT IT'S AROUND THAT BALL PARK AND THE POINT THEY'RE MAKING TODAY IS ANOTHER SMALL FIRMS WILL DO BUSINESS WITH THOSE FIRMS AND THAT THAT MATTERED WAS THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES
INDEED MEAN I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE SEEN COMING OUT ARE MET YOU KNOW ABOUT ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TO SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS
DEBATE BUT IT'S IT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR I MEAN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO A LARGE MARKET OF PEOPLE FROM THE E.U. WHO COULD COME HERE TO WORK IT'S EXTRA AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE ON TRAVEL AND TOURISM AROUND SEVENTY PERCENT SAY THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IS THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN AND THOSE COMPANIES
THAT TELL YOU THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO GET RID OF THE REGULATIONS IMPOSED BY BRUSSELS WHAT KIND OF REGULATIONS ARE THEY I MEAN OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ARE THEY WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS RED TAPE THAT SOME BUSINESSES COMPLAINED ABOUT SMALL WELL THE TOP BURDEN A MEMBERS' FACES THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE A LOT OF THEM ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT AND THEN WHAT DOES THAT WHAT DOES THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE ACTUALLY STATES IN TERMS OF THE HOURS THAT PEOPLE CAN WORK IN A BUSINESS
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY I MEAN MOST PEOPLE DO COMPLY WITH IT IN A WAY BUT I THINK IT IS ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY AND HAVING THAT DIRECTIVE FROM THE E.U. IF YOU LIKE ONCE THEY WANT THEIR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO WORK LONGER HOURS JUST TO PUT IT IN BLUNT TERMS
WELL THEY SAY DON'T MAKE ME WANT TO DO IT MANY OF US AS YOU KNOW DON'T COMPLY WITH THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE ANYWAY I MEAN CERTAINLY JOURNALIST DOCTORS SET SO I THINK IT'S ABOUT HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY AND ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS A BIT TACKY I HAVE TO SAY IT'S CALLED REACH AND IT'S THE CHEMICAL REGULATIONS ACT AND THAT IS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED BY MEMBERS AS BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT AS NEW RESTRICTIONS COME INTO FORCE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN
AND THEY SAY BUSINESSES COULD CLOSE AS A RESULT OF THAT SO THAT'S TO DO WITH PESTICIDES IT'S ACTRESS SO THAT'S HAVING A BIG IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL SECTOR DO YOU SEE ANY CHANGE IN THE DEBATE DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEBATE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING A VIEW SENSE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE
OR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE MOVED THEIR POSITION AT ALL WELL I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE PEOPLE BECOMING WE ARSING PEOPLE BECOMING MORE ENGAGED THEY'RE ASKING MORE QUESTIONS I THINK WHAT THEY REALLY WANT JUSTIN IS MORE INFORMATION WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE MEDIA BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE HEAT THAN LIGHT AND IN SOME CASES
YOU KNOW NUMBERS ARE BANDIED AROUND ALL THE TIME ABOUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE DISPUTES IT AND I THINK REALLY WHAT THEY WANT A CLEAN ANSWERS ON WHAT WITH THE TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS BE FOR V.A.T. YOUR GOODS AND SERVICES SALT THE E.U. THAT SORT OF THING IF YOU'VE GOT Y. U. CLIENTS HOW QUICKLY WOULD REGULATIONS WHICH GOVT US GOVERN SUCH THINGS AS TAXATION OF EARNINGS IN U.K. BUSINESSES BE CHANGED HAVE WE GOT EXISTING TRADE AGREEMENTS HAVE SOME MEMBER STATES REGARDLESS OF MEMBERSHIP
THESE ARE THE THINGS THEY MIGHT SOUND A BIT DULL BUT THEY ARE THE NITTY GRITTY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW AFTER THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE WHAT IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THEIR DAY TO DAY BUSINESS IF WE DECIDE TO LEAVE OR REMAIN YEAH WELL IMPORTANT LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WERE TALKING TO TWO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AT TEN TO EIGHT
THE TIME IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONLY A QUARTER OF TWELVE YEAR OLDS WITH DIABETES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE GETTING ALL SEVEN OF THE ANNUAL TREKS THEY SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP THEIR CONDITION UNDER CONTROL THE FINDINGS COME FROM A SURVEY OF TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES WHICH REQUIRES DAILY DOSES OF INSULIN DOCTOR JUSTIN WARNER IS A CONSULTANT IN PAEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY AND WAS THE CLINICAL LEAD FOR THE NATIONAL PAEDIATRIC DIABETES AUDIT HE JOINS US FROM CARDIFF GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT SORTS OF CHECKS SHOULD A TWELVE YEAR OLD WITH DIABETES HAVE
WELL THERE ARE SEVEN KEY CHECKS WHICH ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND CLINICAL EXCELLENCE AND THESE INCLUDE A MEASURE OF GROWTH THAT'S HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND MEASURE OF OVERALL BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE A MEASURE OF KIDNEY FUNCTION HI CHECKS AND FOOT CHECKS SO SOME SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE SIMPLE CHECKS TO DO HEIGHT WEIGHT BLOOD PRESSURE FOR EXAMPLE WHY ARE THEY BEING NEST
THAT SORT OF THING SUCH AS HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND BLOOD PRESSURE ACTUALLY VERY WELL RECORDED AND WE'RE APPROACHING THE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF PATIENTS GETTING THOSE BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS THE KIDNEYS EYES AND PUT CHECKS AND LESS WELL RECORDED SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY WE RELY ON THE UNITS TO SUBMIT THIS DATA TO US SO WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT JUST NOT RECORDING SUCH CHECKS HAVE BEEN DONE THEM ALL THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY BEING DOWN I SUSPECT IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH
SO SOME OF IT MIGHT BE PEOPLE IN THIS CASE PARENTS NOT TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO APPOINTMENTS OR NOT REALISING THAT THESE CHEQUES ARE NECESSARY AND SOME OF IT MIGHT BE INSTITUTIONAL
YES AND HIS COMBINATION OF BOTH WHAT WE TRY AND WORK VERY MUCH FROM PARTNERSHIP WITH FAMILIES AND CHILDREN SO IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND THEIR PARENTS TO ENSURE THEY GET DONE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BUT IF THAT ISN'T THE CASE AT THE MOMENT OR IF THE DATA IS INCOMPLETE HOW WORRYING IS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS FROM NOT KNOWING EARLY ON THAT SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG WITH WITH EYES OR OR FEET FOR EXAMPLE
YES IN FACT WE VERY RARELY SEE COMPLICATIONS IN CHILDHOOD BUT TYPE ONE DIABETES IT IS A LIFELONG CONDITION AND THERE'S AN IMPORTANT TO SCREENING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SEARCH THAT IF A PROBLEM IS FOUND IT'S FOUND EARLY AND CAN BE DEALT WITH
RIGHT AND THAT THAT IS YOUR WORRY THAT IF THAT ISN'T THE CASE EARLY ON WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE FOR THE PATIENT LATER ON IN LIFE YET YES COS IT'S PART OF AN ONGOING LIFELONG SCREENING PROGRAMME
AND I THINK WHAT WE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ALSO IS THAT OVERALL THE THE DIABETES CONTROL THEIR CHILDREN TOM DUH PIECES IT IS IMPROVING AND WE'VE SEEN OVER FIVE YEARS NOW AND IMPROVING TRENDS IT'S NOT JUST A ONE OFF A YEAR OF IMPROVEMENT IT'S FIVE YEARS OF CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT AND THIS IS NOW APPROACHING SOME OF OUR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS WHO HAVE BEEN A PROUD OF US FOR FOR SOME YEARS SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD NEWS STORY AS WELL
DOCTOR JUSTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I'M SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LARGEST RECRUITMENT COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY
YES COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXPRESSED HIS CONCERNS OVER HER POTENTIAL BRAX IT ROB YEUNG HAS THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE WORLD OF BUSINESS ONE YES MORNING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A DECO IT'S GETS ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF ITS GLOBAL REVENUES IN THE U.K. AND IRELAND AND IT SAYS THE U.K. SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE COMPANY'S BASED IN SWITZERLAND OR NON E. STATE DECADES CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS ALAN THE HOUSE I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE SEEING A CHANGE IN U.K. HIGHER IN PATTERNS AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THERE IS A GROWING AND THIRD INTAE COMING BEFORE DO DEVOTE AND WHAT WE SEE ALSO THAT ALL CUSTOMERS ARE SOMEHOW DELAYING ALL KIND OF MAJOR INVESTMENT AND THEY'RE ALSO DELAYING RECRUITMENT OF HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE HERE IN U.K.
CAN YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES WE HAVE CUSTOMERS HAVING U.K. AS A GATEWAY TO YOUR OP WE'S MAJOR DISTRIBUTION CENTRE AND B. FOR INVESTING IN A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTRE OR DEATH TAKING THE DECISION TO PUT THAT ON ALL YOU SEE A LOT OF BANKS A LOT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES HAVE DECIDED TO WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE TWENTY THIRD OFF TUNE BEFORE HIRING NEW HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE WILL THESE JOBS
THEN BE CREATED AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM NO MATTER WHAT THE RESULT DID JOBS WILL BE CREATED
EITHER IN U.K. OR SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IF THERE IS A BRECK'S IT FOR SURE THESE COMPANIES WILL DECIDE TO INVEST SOMEWHERE ELSE IN AND ON THE CONTRARY AND ALL THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO HAVE THEIR GATEWAY TO TO YOUR OP BUT NOT MORE ANY MORE BASED ON LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THAT THERE WOULD STILL BE FREE TRADE ESSENTIALLY
THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IF THE U.K. CHOOSES TO LEAVE THERE WOULD BE INDEED CONTINUOUS FREE TRADE BUT LET'S NOT FORGET STEP TODAY YOU CASE FUNCTIONING EUROPE EUROPEAN TRADE AGREEMENT
IF YOU GET IS LEAVING EUROPE U.K. WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW TRADE AGREEMENT AND I TAKE ALWAYS EXAMPLE OF CANADA EUROPE IS CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING WE SCAN AROUND A TRADE AGREEMENT IT IS ALREADY LAST THING SINCE MOM AND EIGHT YEARS AND WE HAVEN'T WE DON'T HAVE SILVER AND A GRIM UNTIL DAY A DECK IT WAS A SWISS COMPANY SWITZERLAND IS NOT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU ARE DOING
VERY WELL YOU'VE GOT A PRESENT RIGHT ACROSS THE E.U. SO AREN'T YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW A BIG COMPANY CAN FLOURISH AND GROW INTERNATIONALLY IN A STATE WHICH IS NOT AN E.U. SWITZERLAND IS ALSO THE RESULT OF DECADES OF NEGOTIATION IF YOU KAY WOULD HAVE TO STOP AND NOW TIME IN A NON APPEARANCE DIS WILL TAKE TIME AND WE HAVE ALSO OR CONCERT REGARDING AN END
SINCE THE DEVOTE OFF THIS MASS IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE FOR YOU NO DOUBT THERE IS CAN OFFER US TRACTION COMING TO SWITZERLAND AND WE ARE AS A MAJOR EMPLOYER WE ARE ALSO WORRIED WE SEE THAT WE HAVE MORE AND MORE DIFFICULTY TO A TRACT HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE TO SWITZERLAND ANY FIGHTING EXAMPLE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL END CHEMICALS INDUSTRY
FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MENTORS IN DISS INDUSTRIES ARE COMING FROM OUTSIDE SWITZERLAND SO IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE REGARDING THAT AND ATTRACTIVENESS AND COMPETITIVENESS OFFER OFFER COUNTRY IF THE U.K. VOTES TO LEAVE EUROPEAN UNION THERE MAY WELL BE SOME E. YOU MANDATED LAWS ON EMPLOYMENT WHICH ARE REMOVED FROM THE STATUTE BOOK IN THE U.K. EMPLOYERS REGULARLY COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT THEY CALL RED TAPE
AND SO WOULDN'T THAT ACTUALLY BE WELCOMED BY BUSINESS LEADERS I THINK THAT THERE IS A COMING OFF MIFFED THAT THE LABOUR CODY HERE IN THE U.K. OR IN INDO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IS DECIDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION A U.K. CAN DECIDE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOUR CALLED EVEN BEING INDIA YOU IF THEY DECIDE TO REGULATE LESS OR MORE OR TO CHANGE A REGULATION THAT'S THE DECISION OFFERS YOU KATE IT'S NOT THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
I DO HOUSE THE OTHER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF A DECO ROB THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A NEW PLAY ABOUT TO OPEN AT THE ROYAL COURT THEATRE IN LONDON PUTS VETERANS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE FALKLANDS CONFLICT CENTRE STAGE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ARGENTINIAN DIRECTOR LOLA TO SHAPE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INTO A PIECE OF WORK IN WHICH THEY ARE THE PERFORMERS AS WELL AS THEIR SUBJECTS ARE ARTS EDITOR WILL GO PAT'S WENT ALONG TO REHEARSALS

BETWEEN THEM THE BAR AND AFTER THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR IS VERY STRONG SO I THINK SOMEHOW NOW THEY BECAME REALLY A GROUP AND THEY TAKE EACH OTHER IN A WAY THAT FOR ME WAS VERY SURPRISING
ONE OF THE VETERANS TAKING PART IN THE PRODUCTION IS LOU ARMOUR WAS A SERVING SOLDIER STATIONED ON THE FALKLAND ISLANDS AT THE TIME OF THE ARGENTINIAN INVASION I'VE BEEN THERE ABOUT FOUR DAYS
THINGS SUDDENLY ERUPTED AROUND MOODY BROUGHT BARRACKS AND GOVERNMENT HOUSE WE WATCH THE ATTACK GOING IN ANOTHER TRAY SIR EXPLOSIONS WE CLEAR THE RADIO CHATTER THERE'S A MAJOR SOAP

SIT DOWN THAT'S IT AND THAT WE WOULD WANT TO LAY DOWN ARMS LET'S GO TO MISSUS DIANA GOULD IN OUR BRISTOL STUDIO MISSUS GOULD YOUR QUESTION PLEASE THE CONTENTIOUS SINKING OF THE ARGENTINIAN SHIP GENERAL BELGRANO BY A BRITISH SUBMARINE LETTER A FAMOUS EXCHANGE ON B.B.C.'S NATIONWIDE BETWEEN VIEWER DIANA GOULD
AND THE PRIME MINISTER WHY WHEN THE BELGRANO THE ARGENTINIAN BATTLESHIP WAS OUTSIDE THE EXCLUSION ZONE AND ACTUALLY SAILING AWAY FROM THE FALKLANDS WHY DID YOU GIVE THE ORDERS TO SINK IT BUT IT WAS NOT SAILING AWAY FROM THE FALKLANDS IT WAS IN EARLIER

BY ME BECAUSE I'M IN A MESS FOR ME AND PARTICULATES BEING VERY GOOD AREN'T PROCESS BECAUSE I LIKE
THE IDEA OF REFRESHING EVERYONE'S MEMORY REGARDING THE WAR EVERYBODY LOOK WHAT THE MEMORY ARE THE ONES WHO DIED ARE MADE A SACRIFICE AT WAR AND IN MY PARTICULAR CASE THE MEMORY OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PEOPLE THAT DIED ON THE ANNA I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAME BACK FEELING VICTORIOUS I THINK EVERYBODY CAME BACK ON THE CAMERA CAME BACK WITH A SENSE OF
WE'VE JUST BEEN TO WAR AND IT'S NOT A GREAT EXPERIENCE SO WHY DID YOU WANT TO ENTER INTO THIS PROCESS WHERE YOU WOULD BE DREDGING UP ALL THOSE OLD MEMORIES BECAUSE WE SHARE COMMON EXPERIENCES WHICH LAID A FEW GHOSTS TO REST IT RAISE A COUPLE OF GOES FROM OTHER EXPERIENCES I HAD BUT IT'S AUNT MAKE YOURSELF OR ME TO LAY THOSE TO REST
WELL COMPASS REPORT IN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR THE SPORT IS ROB THANKS JUSTIN HELLO AGAIN SO JUST ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY RUNS TO GO FOR EVENING CAPTAIN ALISTAIR COOKE IN ORDER TO OVERTAKE TEST CRICKET'S ALL TIME RECORD RUN SCORER SACHIN TENDULKAR THE COOK NOW TWELFTH IN THAT PARTICULAR BATTING ORDER MIGHT MORE IMMEDIATELY HAVE NUMBER ELEVEN SUNIL GALLUS SCAR MIGHT JUST ANOTHER EIGHTY TAKE HER THERE

WHEN SIR ANTHONY HEARTS INQUIRY INTO HISTORICAL ABUSE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BEGINS LOOKING INTO THE NOTORIOUS KING CORA BOYS HOME TODAY ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IT WILL BE EXPLORING IS WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WERE INVOLVED IN COVERING UP WHAT HAPPENED THERE FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT CHILDREN WERE ABUSED AT KING CORA THREE MEN WHO RAN THE HOME IN EAST BELFAST WERE CONVICTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE OF ABUSING ELEVEN BOYS BUT AT LEAST TWENTY NINE WERE ABUSED THERE RIGHT UP TO THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES
WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM BELFAST BY CLINT MARCIA SURVIVOR OF ABUSE AT KING CORA AND BY THE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST CHRIS MOORE WHO'S FOLLOWED THE STORY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING CLINT MASSIE HOW LONG WERE YOU AT KEW
HE WAS IN CONCORD FOR APPROXIMATELY IT WANTS AND HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU ARRIVED THERE I WAS SIXTEEN AND WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR TIME
FROM FROM DAY ONE I WAS REGULARLY RAPED EVERY MORNING
THAT WAS MY WAY OF GET THEM WALK UP HAD A BEARD
AND YOUR ABUSER WAS A MAN CALLED WILLIAM MCGRATH IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT WHO WAS LATER CONVICTED YEAH THAT'S I AS WELL YOU MCGRATH
AND THIS HAPPENED THROUGHOUT YOUR TIME THERE YES I WAS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE AND WERE YOU ABLE TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT AT THE TIME OR IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS NO I MEAN I I WAS SIXTEEN AT THE TIME I HAD A SOCIAL WORKER WHO WAS TWENTY TWO AT THE TIME YOUNG WOMAN I MEAN AND A DIFFERENT HE DIDN'T MENTION THINGS

IT WAS ARMOURED CARS ROAMING THE STREETS EVERYWHERE
SO
PEELED THEN BEGINS WHEN YOU SELL THE BED BIG PICTURE AND NOBODY WOULD WANT IN LESSON TOAD SOMEBODY LIKE MYSELF
CHRIS MOORE WHEN WHEN DID YOU START TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE CAN GO AND GET INTERESTED IN THE STORY THE STORY FIRST EMERGED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND IT WAS A STORY OR BOYD APPARENTLY THERE WAS WHAT WAS CALLED A NEWSPAPER THAT BROOKED ASTORIA HOMOSEXUAL VICE RING AND THE INTRIGUE KHIAM WHEN THE THREE STAFF WE'RE COMING TO TRIAL
IT EMERGED THAT ONE OF THEM WILLIAM MCGRATH WAS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST BECAUSE OF HIS LOYALIST CONNECTION TO RUN AND A PARAMILITARY SMALL PARAMILITARY GROUP CALLED TARA HE WAS INVOLVED IN ORGANISING MEETINGS IN ORANGE HALLS AND UNIONIST HALLS HE GAVE TALKS ABOUT THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO ABOUT HOW THE I.R.A. REPUBLICANISM WAS GOING TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY AND
AND HE HAD HE HAD GOOD CONNECTIONS WITH THE UNIONIST FAMILY JIM ON THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VISITOR AT TEARS HOME HE WOULD HAVE HAD MEETINGS WITH IAN PAISLEY AND PIGMENT IN PAISLEY'S CHURCH AND OTHER PREMISES SO HE WENT TO STRONG WITH THE M.P.S THIS WAS A MAN HE WAS WELL CONNECTED AND WHEN HE DECIDED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO FISH TRIED HE WAS GOING TO DENY ALL THE CHARGES ON TILL THE LAST MOMENT AND THEN HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD PLEAD GUILTY AND EFFECT THERE WAS NO VENTILATION IN THE COURT OF THE FACTS SURROUNDING THE KISS AND ANT
WHEN THEY WHEN THIS STARTS TO BE LOOKED INTO TODAY BY BY THE ABUSE INQUIRY BOTH M.I.FIVE AND M.I.SIX HAVE AGREED TO BE CENTRAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE HEARING IS IT IS IT YOUR HOPE THAT THEREFORE WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
WERE INVOLVED IN IN COVERING UP WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME
WELL IT IS QUITE A PARK TO PEOPLE LIKE CLENT TURNED UNDER OTHER SURVIVORS OF ABUSE AT CAN CORA THAT THERE HAS BEEN A COVER UP AND THE COVER UP HERE HAS CAUSED THEM AS MUCH PAIN AS THE PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE THAT THEY SUFFERED WORST IN CAN CORA I THINK I WAS M.I.FIVE THERE'S FIVE OR SIX OR THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE COMING ALONG AND TAKING PART IN THE I THEN WHY DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARTS TO COMPEL
A DUTCH KIND OF WORRYING IT THESE PEOPLE FROM M.I.FIVE AND FROM M.A. SECTION FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAVE SINGULARLY NOT CO OPERATED REALLY UP TO IN FACT THE TWO ORIGINAL POLICE INVESTIGATIONS WERE BLOCKED BY THE FACT THAT
M.I.FIVE DID NOT PRODUCE AN OFFICER FOR QUESTIONING BY THE POLICE ON TWO OCCASIONS AND TWO SEPARATE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS THE FIRST ONE BY THE ART YOU SEE THE SECOND ONE WAS WAS BY THE YOU SEE BUT IT WAS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SIR GEORGE TAE THEN CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SUSSEX THEY HAVE AGREED TO BE PART TO BE PARTICIPATES IN THIS HEARING CLINT MASSEY
WHAT DID YOU THINK AT THE TIME ABOUT THERE ABOUT THERE THE REASONS FOR WHY YOU KNOW WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO TO GET TO GRIPS WITH WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING EVENTUALLY THERE WERE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS THAN THESE THREE MEN INCLUDING YOUR ABUSER WERE CONVICTED
I THINK IT TOOK SO LONG BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE TO BE PROTECTED PEOPLE HAD TO BE MOVED OUT OF THE PICTURE
SO THAT A TAPE OPEN CHOIR WE CAN TAKE PART BUT NO REAL DALI'S DAWN TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECURITY FORCES THEY WERE STILL GOING TO DO WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO
AND IT WAS WE WERE JUST COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT THEY HAD THEIR ARE SAY IT'S TO PROTECT AND THEY MOVED THEM OUT OF THE PICTURE FOR A WHILE
AND SO YOU SO YOU STILL THINK THERE IS THERE IS MORE TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND ABOUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IT CAN IN ITS IMPLICATIONS WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT TO YOU TO HAVE THIS INCLUDED IN THE GODDARD ENQUIRY
IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT THAT COULD BUT THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD THE BAMBRIDGE AND TIREE MOST PEOPLE COULDN'T POINT TO BAMBRIDGE I'M OUT
AS WELL AS A BIG STORY IN NORTHERN IRELAND THAT TAKE PEOPLE ON THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND BIRMINGHAM
IT'S SMALL BEER BUT ADMITS MEN SHOULDN'T LONG OFF AND WESTMINSTER THEN PEOPLE WILL START THE ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT CAN CORA WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT WHY DESIST KNEE HIM KEEP ON CROPPING UP
BUT CHRIS MOORE IT IS IT IS IT YOUR HOPE THAT THAT IS EVEN IF IT'S NOT PART OF THE GODDARD INQUIRY THAT THAT THE FACT THAT SIR ANTHONY HEARTS IN CURRY'S GOING TO LOOK INTO IT TODAY GIVES YOU THE ANSWERS THAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR I'VE GOT CONCERNS ABOUT IT TO BE TRUTHFUL AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT DOES AND I THINK THAT THE SURVIVORS WHO
NO I REALISED THAT FOR TEN YEARS A MAN WHO WAS REAPING YOUNG YOUNG MAN AND CAN LIKE LIKE WILLIAM MCGRATH SEEM TO BE PROTECTED HE WASN'T CERTAINLY PROSECUTED AND ALL ATTEMPTS TO HAVEN'T PROSECUTED WERE KNOCKED BIKE AND THE M.I.FIVE OPERATION HERE MAKE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE POLICE AND ARMY INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WE'RE NOT ALIKE
TO PROGRESS AT THE THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THEIR HOME AND HAVE A COOK I THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT THE SURVIVORS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO CLINCH HERE I THINK WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED WAS AN ENQUIRY THERE GOT KWAI HE WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO COMPEL PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AND I THINK THAT ARE STILL ON THEIR MINDS AS AS BEING NECESSARY CHRIS MOORE AND KENT MASSEY THANK YOU
THE TIME TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND WRITING THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE FIRST SEA LORD ADMIRAL SIR PHILIP JONES ARGUES THAT THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND SHOULD ACT AS A WARNING AGAINST FURTHER CUTS TO THE NAVE IT COMMEMORATIONS WILL BE HELD TODAY THEM UP THERE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH SEA BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND GERMAN FLEETS IN WHICH MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND MEN DIED SIR PHILIP RIGHT THAT ALTHOUGH THE U.K.
THE LONGER FACES THE SAME KIND OF EX ESSENTIAL THREAT THAT GERMANY REPRESENTED DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR THE SEA IS A FRONT LINE HE SUGGESTS THAT IN A WORLD OF VARIED AND COMPLEX SECURITY CHALLENGES A VIABLE NAVAL FORCE IS NEEDED TO DELIVER BOTH THE SOFT TOUCH OF PREVENTATIVE ENGAGEMENT AND THE HARD PUNCH OF MILITARY POWER THE GUARDIAN DEVOTES ITS ENTIRE FRONT PAGE TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM ASKING AND ITS HEADLINE CAN CAMERON KEEP BRITAIN IN EUROPE THE PAPER SAYS THAT AS CAMPAIGNING MOVES INTO ITS FINAL STAGE AHEAD OF NEXT MONTH'S VOTE
THERE ARE CONCERNS IN THE REMAIN CAMPED THAT NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE TO WOO LABOUR SUPPORTERS MANY OF THEM ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN DON'T UNDERSTAND AT THE PARTY LEADERSHIP IS IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SUN'S WRITTEN A PIECE ABOUT WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS THE THREE BRECHT'S THE TEARS AS SHE HASN'T WRITTEN AT ITSELF IT HAS THEM WRITING IT THERE THE CONSERVATIVE M.P.S BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO AND LABOUR M.P. A STUART THEY ARGUE THAT AN EXIT WOULD ALLOW
THE U.K. TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS ITS ECONOMY AND ITS DEMOCRACY ELSEWHERE IN THE PAPER A PIECE BY LORD SUGAR SUGGESTING THAT REMAIN VOTE IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE BRITAIN'S VOICES HEARD IN BRUSSELS WILL BE THE MUGS IN THE WORLD IF WE LEFT THE SET AND THE TIMES LAUNCH OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAVE OUR MEADOWS FROM MEDIOCRITY IT SAYS THAT ATTEMPTS TO BRING COLOUR BACK TO THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE ARE BEING UNDERMINED BY SEED FIRMS SELLING GENERIC MIXES OF WILD FLOWERS
ONE BOTANIST FROM THE CHARITY PLANTLIFE TELLS THE PAPER THAT CONSERVATION ORGANISATIONS AND LANDOWNERS SHOULD DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION TO GROWING FLOWERS THAT ACTUALLY FROM THE AREA THE PAPER'S LEADER CONCLUDES LET A THOUSAND FLOWERS BLOOM EACH IN ITS RIGHT PLACE THAT I NEED TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S GET FURTHER TASTE OF THE E.U. DEBATE FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER THIS MORNING JIM IS JOINING US AGAIN FROM GLASGOW MORNING
INDEED I MEAN GLASS GOOD JUSTIN THANKS VERY MUCH WILL THE OLDER GENERATION LOOK AT THE RIVER CLYDE AND REALISE THAT IT ISN'T REALLY THAT RIVER THEY ONCE KNEW FROM THE CITY CENTRE HERE IF YOU
LOOK ALONG THE WATER YOU WOULD ONCE HAVE SEEN CRANES AND GANTRIES FILLING THE SKY ALL THE WAY WESTWARDS TO THE SEA NOW THESE SHIPYARDS FROM THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY ONWARDS WHERE THE ENGINE OF EMPIRE THEY BUILT NAVY SAINT LINUS AND THIS WAS ONE GREAT RIVER FACTORY
NO MORE THE WORK HAS DWINDLED A NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION HAS TAKEN MOST OF IT AWAY IN THE HALL I HAD A LANDSCAPE HAS GONE
I'LL BE TALKING TO SOME OF THE MEN WHO STILL BUILD SHIPS HERE IN A MOMENT ABOUT WHERE THIS STORY SITS IN THE ARGUMENTS OVER EUROPE FIRST TO THE GLASGOW UNIVERSITY ARCHIVE AND TONY POLLARD ARCHAEOLOGIST AND HISTORIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY
TO SAVOUR SOME OF THE HISTORY THAT MADE THE CLYDE WE LOOKED TOGETHER AT THE BEAUTIFUL PLANS FOR THE DOOMED LINER LUSITANIA
SHE WAS ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED FEET LONG AND REALITY AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS A CUTAWAY WHICH SHOWS ALL OF THE INTERIOR SO YOU'VE GOT THAT LOVELY SALONS THE LUXURIOUS PASSENGER CABINS THE ENGINE ROOMS IT WERE LINERS LIKE THE LOOSER TANIA THAT HAD REALLY MADE THE REPUTATION OF CLYDE SHIPBUILDING LOOKING BACK FROM TODAY IT'S INTERESTING TO REALISE THAT IT WAS ALWAYS SIR PRECARIOUS BUSINESS EVEN THE DAYS OF ITS GREAT SUCCESS BECAUSE THERE WAS COMPETITION EVERYWHERE
VERY MUCH SO AND THAT THE FACT THAT THESE COMPANIES HAD TO CHANGE THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY TOOK MASSIVE INVESTMENT AND AT TIMES THAT WOULD BE MISJUDGED OR IT WOULD BE TOO LATE SO THIS IS NOTHING NEW WHEN
THE CLYDE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT FROM THE CENTRE OF GLASGOW AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE DOWN THE RIVER IT MUST HAVE BEEN JUST A HIVE OF ACTIVITY IT WAS AND BOTH SIDES WERE JUST CHOCK A BLOCK WITH NOT JUST SHIPBUILDING BUT ALL OF THE ANCILLARY INDUSTRIES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT IT
AND HERE BESIDE THE LOOSER TANIA IS A BOOK CALLED SCOTLAND'S INDUSTRIAL SOUVENIR FILLED WITH WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS AND ACCOUNTS OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE AND A BEAUTIFULLY ENGRAVED PAGE HERE COLOURED PAVED ADVERTISING VARIOUS FIRMS WERE DOING GREAT THINGS AND PROMINENT AMONG THEM THE FAIRFIELD SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED OVER AT GOVAN ACROSS THE RIVER FROM THE ARCHIVE HERE
AND I'M GOING OVER THERE NOW A FEW HOURS EARLIER FAIRFIELD SHIPYARD GOVAN THE QUEEN LAUNCHED THE CANADIAN PACIFIC LINER IMPREZA BRITAIN HERE IS THE BEAUTY OF THE CAN COME ONLY FROM BY MARKSMANSHIP HANDED DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON THROUGH THE GOOD YEARS IN THEM
THE GLORY DAYS IT'S SO DIFFERENT NOW AT FAIRFIELDS WHERE SO MANY GREAT HOOKS WERE BUILT B.A.E. SYSTEMS ARE BUILDING A FEW OF SHORE PATROL VESSELS THERE ARE EIGHT HUNDRED MEN DIVIDED BETWEEN HERE AND RECITE AND FIFE WHO ARE CLINGING ON TO JOBS WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH SOME OF THE YARD WORKERS
I WAS REMINDED HOWEVER THAT THIS NOT NEW
IT'S OFTEN BEEN VERY DIFFICULT YOU COULD NEVER PLAN FOR A FUTURE COS YOU NEVER KNEW IF YOU HAD A FUTURE THAT CAME ABOUT IAN BECAUSE OF
CHEAP WORK ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS LIKE KERRY IN THE FIFTIES AND THEN CHINA REMEMBER GOVAN AND MUCH SEVENTIES AND DISH STARTED SELLING THEIR DESIGNS TO THE JAPANESE TO THE TRAINEES INTO OTHER COUNTRIES
WE DON'T HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY AND THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE A FINANCE INDUSTRY YOU CANNOT COMPETE WITH A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WHEN THE PIECES ARE SELLING EACH OTHER INSURANCE POLICIES
THE QUESTION IS DO YOU NEED A NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY THE DIRECTOR OF THE LANCASHIRE AN INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS RESEARCH PHIL WYMAN
THINKS A BREAK WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD HELP THE E.U. DOESN'T WANT ONE SECTION OF THE SINGLE MARKET TO BE TREATED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN OTHERS SO WE CAN'T HELP OUR FIRM'S LEXIE ALLOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THINGS A DIFFERENT WAY IT ALLOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A MORE ACTIVE INDUSTRIAL POLICY BUT TO DAVID BAILEY PROFESSOR OF INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY AT ASTON BUSINESS SCHOOL AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY THAT'S PLAIN WRONG THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR HAVING WROUGHT ON STATE AID SO THAT WE GET FAIR COMPETITION
ACROSS THE SINGLE MARKET BUT THIS ARGUMENT AT THAT PREVENTS US FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE INDUSTRIAL POLICIES COMPLETE HOGWASH I MEAN LOOK FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY RECENTLY IT WAS A BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHICH OPPOSED
HIGHER TARIFFS AT EUROPEAN LEVEL AGAINST CHINESE IMPORTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE BEING PART OF THE E.U. HAS NOT STOPPED THEM INTERVENING TO SUPPORT THEIR STEEL
BACK TO THE CLYDE AND JOHN BRIAN AND IAIN TUMBLE WORKERS HERE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS ONE THINKS EUROPE HELPS THE OTHER DOESN'T
IF WE COME OUT OF YOUR OAP THEN ARE WE GOING TO GET WHAT FROM ELSEWHERE YOU THINK AS A CHILD I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CHANCE I THINK OPERA STOP EVERYONE GOING ON I'VE GONE TYPES YOU WERE SHAKING YOUR HEAD THERE AND IT IS IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WE'VE GONE TO GERMANY AND HOLLAND WHAT IS SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE IS SAUCE FOR THE GANDER
YOU'VE GOT YOUR ONLY GERMANY AND SPEAR YOU SEE THE BIG SHIPYARDS WHEN A GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO SAVE ITS ENDLESSLY THEN FORCES MONEY FINANCE AND TECHNOLOGY COULD BE BROUGHT TO YOU'VE THAT INDUSTRY DO YOU THINK THAT IS
IRRELEVANT TO US BEING IN THE E.U. IT WHAT WE NEED AS AN INDUSTRIAL POLICY BUT THERE'S AN EXTRA INGREDIENT HERE
JOHN BROWN CAN SEE THE ARGUMENT FOR A ONE NATION INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY
BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO BE A CULTURAL BRECK'S A TEAR WE ARE LIKE BEING EUROPEAN HAS REALLY BEEN ABLE TO GO EXPLAIN GO IT'S A VULGAR EVERYONE WILL LEAK OR THAT MY GRANDA'S NAME WAS DANIEL MY CARNIVAL HE WAS A NUMBER A MUDDY CHAT BENGALI SCORE IS SCARED
MY SON'S GOING BACK UP A REFUGEE YOU ARE SO SO I DO INTERESTED IN UNIONS LIKE FINE IN PAUL'S IT'S THE FUTURE FOR YOUR KIDS AND YOURSELF AND I THINK A BAGUETTE IN THE CHILL THAT EUROPE PROVIDES US WITH A SAFER FUTURE THEN I TEENY WE WENT SO ON THE CLYDE WHERE THE GREAT INDUSTRIES HAVE WINNER IN A WAY IN THE LAST GENERATION
THERE'S A FEELING THAT WHEREVER YOU STAND ON THE QUESTION BEING PUT NEXT MONTH THAT PERHAPS IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IT'S WORKED GOVERNMENT ANY GOVERNMENT CAN DO
TO HELP THESE INDUSTRIES MATCH THE CHALLENGES OF THE TIME AND MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION THAT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN REMAIN OR LEAVE
MORE FROM JIM IN GLASGOW AT ABOUT TWENTY TO NINE THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THAT ALSO COMES FROM GLASGOW THIS MORNING THE SPEAKER IN A STUDIO THERE IS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING UNLESS YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY YOU MAY NOT RECOGNISE THE NAME OF SEALER GUPPY YOU MAY BE EQUALLY UNAWARE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF SIR LOAFER HOWARD THOUGH I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT MORE OF I SHOULD RECOGNISE THEM
GUPPY AS WILLIAM WAS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL INVENTOR IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND USUAL BECAUSE SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF ELEVATIONS FOR A METHOD OF BRIDGE BUILDING WHICH INSPIRED TELFORD AND PUT A NAIL TO A FOUR POSTER BED WHICH DOUBLED AS A GYMNASIUM
ALSO UNUSUAL BECAUSE BEFORE THE WOMAN'S PROPERTY ACT BECAME LAW SHE TOOK OUT PATENTS AND HER OWN NAME YET DESPITE THE SINGULARITY SHE HAS NEVER BEEN CELEBRATED AS A GREAT BRITISH INVENTOR
ALMOST THREE MILLENNIA SEPARATE HER FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LOT FOR HOWARD BUT THEY'VE BEEN IN PRINT FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS THE APPEARED AND THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES JEWISH WOMAN BORN TO A MAN WHO HAD NO SONS WHEN HE DIED THE LAW OF INHERITANCE BY THEM THEIR FATHER'S PROPERTY AND WEALTH HAD TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THEIR UNCLES UNDERSTANDABLY THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS AN FEAR SEO RATHER THAN GLYN AND BE IN IT THEY WENT TO SEE MOSES AND MADE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE INJUSTICE
NOISY IS NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME CONFRONTED WITH AN AWKWARD PROBLEM TOOK IT TO THE LORD AND PRAY AND GOD SAID CHANGED A LOT
TO ME IT'S REMARKABLE THAT LONG BEFORE GENDER EQUALITY WAS AN ISSUE AND COMMON PARLANCE THESE CESS THERE'S DEFIANCE OF BUYING THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED THE HEART OF GOD AND CHANGE THE LAW OF PROPERTY
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THE NAME OF SEALER GUPPY NOT EVERYONE HAS THE DICTIONARY OF INNOVATION ON THEIR SHELVES AND YESTERDAY IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT RATHER THAN WOMAN BEING WRITTEN OUT OF HISTORY MANY HAVE NEVER BEEN WRITTEN
BUT THAT CAN'T BE SAID FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF SIR LOUGHER HIDE THE APPEARED IN THE BABEL COPIES OF WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE THEY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN THEN THEY CAN'T BE WRITTEN OUT
WHY IS THAT I WHO HAVE PROBABLY READ THE BIBLE FROM FRONT TO BACK HER OWN TWENTY TIMES NEVER KNEW OFF THEM UNTIL RECENTLY
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE AS PART OF THE JEWISH CHRISTIAN TRADITION AND IN COMPANY WITH MOST MALE BELIEVERS HAVE SKIMMED OVER MUCH OF WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT WOMEN AND PREFERENCE FORBIDDING ABOUT MEN LIKE SAW THE SAMPSON AND WHOM LITTLE BY WAY OF MODEL OF SPIRITUAL EDIFICATION MAYBE A DECADE NOW
I CAN'T OBLITERATE THAT HISTORICAL DEFECT BUT I CAN DETERMINED NOT TO PROMOTE IT
AND RELIGIOUS AS AND ALL OTHER WALKS OF LIFE AS A MAN I HAVE THE CHOICE TO LIVE IN A MAN'S WORLD OR I CAN CHOOSE TO LIVE IN AN INCLUSIVE WORLD AND WHICH THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMAN WILL NOT COMPLIMENT ME
IT WILL MAKE ME A FULL HUMAN BEING
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH JOHN BELL THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT COULD WE BE ON THE CUSP OF A REVOLUTION IN CANCER TREATMENT THAT IS WHAT THE MIRROR IS CERTAINLY REPORTING THIS MORNING RIGHT ACROSS ITS FRONT PAGE THE NEWS THAT A DYING CANCER PATIENT WAS SAVED BY A NEW TWO PRONGED IMMUNO THERAPY TREATMENT THAT MADE HIS TUMOURS
COMPLETELY VANISH THE REPORT THEY'VE BASED THIS CLAIM ON IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL HEALTH AND THE PATIENT WAS BEING TREATED FOR SKIN CANCER IN SEATTLE IN THE UNITED STATES LET'S TALK TO ANGUS DALGLISH PROFESSOR OF ONCOLOGY FROM SAINT GEORGE'S UNIVERSITY OF LONDON WHO SPECIALISES IN THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU
AND I I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS ET-CETERA BUT WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THIS IN THAT JOURNAL DOES IT EXCITE YOU BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO SAY CAUTIOUS OH IT IS VERY EXCITING BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY
TELL US WHAT THE SIMPLE TEMPLE BE LIFT IT STIMULATES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT HER FEMUR COUNTS HER NOW SO THESE ALL CAMP BUT IT FAILS TO CONTROL THEM BECAUSE THE I BICKLEY SUBSTANCES BUT DEPEND IT PROBABLY IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH IF IT DIDN'T BELIEVE HE'D BE IMMUNE TO IT AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THE DOOR AND THEN IT'S GONE IN
AND DOES IT MATTER THAT IT'S SKIN CANCER IN THIS CASE COULD BE ANY CATS
HAD THE WORD USED AT LEAST IN THE DAILY MIRROR'S REPORT NOTHING THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUOTING E'S AT A DOCTOR WHO WAS USED THIS WORD AND THAT'S WHY I WAS CAUTIOUS WHEN I FIRST SAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU IS THIS WORD CURE
AND FOR PEOPLE WITH CANCER AND PEOPLE WITH RELATIVES WITH CANCER LISTENING TO THIS WOOD I MEAN CAN THEY BE SURE THAT EVERYTHING NOW THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THEM WITH ALL THESE NEW AND EXPERIMENTAL
EFFORTS THERE THAT ACTUALLY IS BEING DONE IN BRITISH HOSPITALS AT THE MOMENT
IT'S NOT A MATTER THEN OF SPEEDING UP THE TRIALS THAT YOU THINK IT IS UNREALISTIC AND POTENTIALLY PRESUMABLY UNSAFE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DOING MORE OF THOSE TROUSERS
AND GUS DALGLEISH PROFESSOR I'M ESTABLISHED FASCINATORS HAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AS ONE IT'S THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND THEN RICH IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST THANK YOU MICHELLE GOOD MORNING WELL IF YOU'RE SPENDING A DAY ACROSS SCOTLAND'S NORTHERN IRELAND'S WESTERN AREAS OF ENGLAND WEST WALES EXPECT ANOTHER FINE AND DRY DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE IT IS A DIFFERENT STORY FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST AND THAT'S WHERE I'LL BEGIN THE DETAILED FORECAST ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND HERE

WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO FUDDLE ALBERT RANI A DOCTOR WHO LIVES IN BAGHDAD BUT HE'S FROM FALLUJAH AND STILL HAS FAMILY
THE IDEA THAT WHAT ELEVEN YEAH MUCH AT THE MOMENT IRAQI SECURITY FORCES ARE SURROUNDING THE CITY AND SO FAR THERE ARE NO SAFE CORRIDORS FOR CIVILIANS TO LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME MORE DASH MILITANTS HAVE MOVED FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF FOR LUCIA AND ARE NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE CITY WHY NOT GET DOWN

IN ADDITION WE HAD SOME REPORTS FROM A COUPLE OF FAMILY AS YOU CAN TELL JUST HOW TRAUMATISED FAMILIES AND BECOME DEVELOPED PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS SOME PEOPLE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE AND ANOTHER FAMILY HAD DROWNED THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR RETRO AT ALL POP LET CHILDREN OUT ON THE STREET BECAUSE THEY CAN SUPPORT DO YOU CREATE THEM AND THESE ARE STORIES OF UTTER DESPERATION
CAROLINE CLARK OF THE U.N. H. C. ARE IN IRAQ THIS IS AN IRAQI FIGHT AGAINST I S. INTERNATIONAL WAR PLANES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED BUT THE UNITED STATES IS WARY OF APPEARING TO SUPPORT THE SHIA MILITIAS WERE PART OF THE GROUND OFFENSIVE AND ITS FORCES SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES WHEN THEY TOOK ON SUNNI INSURGENTS IN FALLUJAH BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR WE'RE JOINED FROM THE RADIO CAR BY SIR JEREMY GREEN STOCK WHO WAS THE U.K.'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO IRAQ BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND TWO THOUSAND FOR GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING AND FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THAT TIME HOW DIFFICULT IS IT GOING TO BE TO ACHIEVE THE IRAQI AIM OF DECISIVELY WINNING AGAINST BIAS IN SYMPHONY
WELL IT'S BOUND TO BE A VERY DESTRUCTIVE CAMPAIGN THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF ENTERING A CITY LIKE FOR LUCIA THAT'S GUARDED BY PRETTY RUTHLESS FIGHTERS WHO ARE PREPARED TO USE THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AS HUMAN SHIELDS THERE'S NO WAY OF RETAKING FOR LUCIA BY THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES WITHOUT FAIRLY SERIOUS HARM TO THE CIVILIAN POPULATION I'M AFRAID
EVEN THE IDEA OF OF RETAKING PERHAPS GLOSSES OVER THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE FIGHTERS AT LEAST NEVER CAME IN FROM ANYWHERE ELSE THEY ARE PEOPLE OF FALLUJAH FROM VILLAGE AND THIS IS THEIR TURF
WELL IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PICTURE YOU'VE GOT THE PEAK THESE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHO WISH TO SET UP THAT CAGE EFFORT IN THE UNGOVERNED AREAS OF NORTH WESTERN IRAQ
YOU'VE GOT THE OLD BA'ATH PARTY RENEGADES WHO HAVE ALWAYS RESISTED THE GOVERNMENT LED NOW BY THE SHEER SECT IN BAGHDAD YOU'VE GOT
CRIMINALS AND OTHER SONI REALLY RESENTFUL SUNNI TRIBAL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE THE BAGHDAD GOVERN THEY'VE ALL GOT TOGETHER
AS A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE BUT MANY OF THEM WILL BE FROM FOR LUCIA ITSELF WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FOCUS OF RESISTANCE AGAINST A BAGHDAD RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT SO IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PICTURE OF THE FIGHTING IS LED BY US
AND THEY WILL COMMAND THE TACTICS OF DEFENDING FOR LUCIA BUT FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS YOU'VE OUTLINED THE THE COMPLICATIONS THE COMPLEX MIX OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED ON THE IRAQI ARMY'S SIDE IN THE BATTLE FOR FOR LUCHA EVEN IF AND WHEN HOPEFULLY THIS IS THIS IS ONE
THEY'LL BE IMMENSE PROBLEMS IN IN HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS PART OF OF IRAQ AFTERWARDS FOR THE FOR THE SAME REASONS AS WHAT YOU FACED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR
YES THE THE SUNNI POPULATION OF ARAB IRAQ HAS NEVER BEEN INTEGRATED WITH THE SCIENCE
THEY'VE ALWAYS WISHED FOR A RETURN TO SUNNI MINORITY RULE IN IRAQ WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE UNDER DON'T DRIP OCRACY OR UNDER THE PRESENT VERY INSECURE POLITICAL SITUATION THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES THEMSELVES HAVE SHIA MILITIAS ALONGSIDE THEM WHO TO SOME EXTENT OR JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER FIGHTERS THAN THE IRAQI ARMY
BUT IF AND WHEN FOR LUCIA'S RECAPTURED THOSE SHIA MILITIAS WILL NOT WANT TO STAY NORTH WEST OF BAGHDAD THERE WANT TO RETURN TO THE SHEER SOUTHALL TO BAGHDAD
BUT WHO GOVERNS THAT PART OF IRAQ AFTER ALL THIS IS OVER IS ANOTHER QUESTION FOR LUCIA IS ONE CITY
THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OVER BY S. AND HIS IS THE FOCUS OF MERGER OPERATIONS NOW ARE MUCH LARGER CITY MOST WILL FURTHER TO THE NORTH WEST WILL BE THE NEXT TARGET AFTER THIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER SO THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO FOR THE NORTH WEST OF IRAQ BUT FOR LOOT HAVE BEEN A VERY POWERFUL SYMBOL PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION THE FACT THEN THAT SOMEWHERE SO CLOSE TO BAGHDAD HAS BEEN ABLE TO BE HELD BY I S. FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS
THAT'S TRUE AND IT SHOWS THE RELATIVE INCOMPETENCE OF THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCES WITHOUT OUTSIDE HELP AND I THINK THEY HAVE GOT SOME OUTSIDE HELP U.S. SPECIAL FORCES ARE PROBABLY THERE ON THE GROUND THEY'VE HAD TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE U.S. AND TO SOME EXTENT FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME FOR IRAQ TO RESETTLE AFTER THIS VERY DISTURBED PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INVASION ANOTHER GENERATION OR SO BEFORE ALL THIS IS SORTED OUT
I THINK THE FIRST PRIORITY BEFORE THEY CAN SORT OUT THEIR OWN POLITICS IS TO GET RID OF THESE PARTLY OUTSIDE PARTLY INSIDE RELIGIOUSLY INSPIRED VIOLENT JIHADISTS WHO ARE DISRUPTING THE POLITICS OF THIS PART OF ME THINK THAT THAT IS POSSIBLE TO TO GET RID OF THEM GIVEN THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEM ARE FROM THIS AREA
WELL SOME OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE AREA HAVE BEEN USING THE MILITARY STRENGTH ON THE TACTICS OF I YES IN ORDER TO RESIST BAGHDAD I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT MANY
TRY BORE ALL URBAN CERTAINLY IN THIS PART OF IRAQ WOULD WANT TAE US TO STAY IF THEY HAD A FREE CHOICE THEY'RE USING THEM FOR CONVENIENCE TO RESIST BAGHDAD THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO REMOVE THE ISLAMIC STATE OUT OF THIS AREA IF THAT IS POSSIBLE
BY ATTRACTING THE POPULATION'S LOYALTY BACK TO UNITED YOU ROCK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME UNDER THE VERY DISTURBED POLITICS OF THE IRAQI STATE
JEREMY GREEN STOCK THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT I'M NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL COMPANIES IN THE U.K. A LOT OF ENERGY AND POTENTIAL AND SOMETIMES ANGUISH AS PEOPLE TRIED TO BUILD SMALL ENTERPRISES AND BIGGER ONES WERE JUST TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT AND EMPLOY A FEW PEOPLE IN THE E.U. DEBATE ONE OF THE CENTRAL PILLARS OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THAT THESE SMALLER ENTERPRISES MOSTLY TO NOT TRADE WITH EUROPE AND SO WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM BEING FREE OF E.U. RULES AND REGULATIONS
BUT TODAY THAT BUSINESS SECRETARY IS GOING TO ATTACK THAT CLAIM WITH HIS OWN SET OF FIGURES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SUPPLY TO COMPANIES THAT DO TRADE WITH THE EAST SO WOULD STILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THEIR RULES WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THOUGH THE POLITICAL DING DONG TO ONE SIDE FOR THE MOMENT TO HEAR JUST SIMPLY THE PERSPECTIVES REALLY TWO SMALL COMPANY BOSSES ABOUT WHAT MATTERS TO THEM IN THIS DEBATE WERE JOINED ON THE LINE FROM SOUTHAMPTON BY SIMON BOYD IS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF REED STEEL WHICH IS A STEEL CONSTRUCTION
COMPANY BASE THERE AND FROM SHEFFIELD BY JULIA GASH IS THE OWNER AND DIRECTOR OF BENNETT DON'T BAGUETTE WHICH MAKES EKO BAGS MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH YOU MY WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO WHAT DOES YOUR COMPANY DO AND HOW MUCH CONTACT YOU HAVE WITH YOU
WE DESIGN MANUFACTURE AND CONSTRUCT ALL TAPES OF STEEL STRUCTURES YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM A SMALL INDUSTRIAL BUILDING TO THE BIGGEST BRIDGES AND FOOTBALL STADIA IN THIS COUNTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD AND YOU EXPORT TO EUROPE NO WE DON'T EXPORT
WHY NOT WELL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE IS THE UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD IN EUROPE HAS MADE US LESS COMPETITIVE IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET WE BUY FIRE OVER REGULATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT OVER REGULATION WE'VE MADE OURSELVES LESS COMPETITIVE THAN EUROPEAN MARKET AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE PROTECTIONISM THAT GOES ON FOR EXAMPLE
WE CAN'T EVEN TAKE A CONTRACT ON IN FRANCE WE LOST THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PONE CONTRITE AND CHILLERS AND ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO WE COULDN'T QUOTE FOR THE BUILDING TO STORE SECURITY FENCING AT CALAIS I SEE SO YOU'D LIKE TO EXPORT TO EUROPE BUT YOU YOU CAN'T YOU SAY BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT EUROPEANS TERENCE FIND THE FACT IN THE YEAH THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE JULIE GAS DO YOU EXPORT TO EUROPE
OH YES BANK IT EXPORTS TO EUROPE AND OUR OFFSHOOT COMPANY TALENTED EXPORTS ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT ABOUT HOT ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT ACTUALLY IS DIRECTLY TO THE E.U. AND THAT GOES WELL
HE GOES VERY WELL TRADING WITH THE E.U. IS INCREDIBLY SMOOTH AND TROUBLE FREE SENDING A PARCEL TO BERLIN I'LL BARCELONA IS JUST THE SAME OR SENDING IT TO BIRMINGHAM YOU JUST STICK A PARCEL LABEL ON IT AND OFF IT GOES O.K. SO RIGHT AT THE VERY START WE'VE GOT TWO VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES OF EITHER DEALING WITH OR TRYING TO DEAL WITH EXPORTING TO THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN I TURN TO THE REGULATIONS SIDE OF IT THE REGULATIONS YOU WERE MENTIONING
IT'S SIMON BOY THAT YOU THINK RULES THAT THAT WHAT THAT COME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HAMPER YOUR BUSINESS HERE
WE DO A HAMPER A BUSINESS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS I REALLY GOT INVOLVED IN IT IN SOME OF THE DAMAGE AND DIRECTS AND REGULATIONS NEARLY A DECADE AGO IN PARTICULAR THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE AND ME EVER LOOMING THREAT OF THE LOSS OF OUR OPT OUT FROM THAT DIRECTIVE
AND YOU KNOW WHY I HEADED UP CAMPING IN BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO TRY AND GET THIS
REMOVAL OF THE OPT OUT REMOVED BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT JUST TO MAKE THIS CLEAR TO PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE APPLIES DOESN'T APPLY IN SOME AREAS OF LIFE DOESN'T IT BUT WHERE IT DOES APPLY IF A PERSON DOESN'T VOLUNTARILY COME TO THEIR EMPLOYER AND SAY IT'S O.K. I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF IT I'M HAPPY TO WORK LONGER HOURS THAN OURS ARE
THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT JUST
TAKE A LOOK AT THE WORKERS FOR A MOMENT IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY THEY WERE REPRESENTED AT THE TIME ABOUT ONE HUNDREDTH WHAT FORCE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THERE'S A PAUL THAT WENT ACROSS THAT WORKFORCE AND THAT YOU KNOW A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT NINETY PER CENT OF THEM DIDN'T WANT ANY FORM OF RESTRICTION ON THE WORKING HOURS AND THIS IS ALL TO DO WITH FLEXIBILITY I CAN'T THEY'RE JUST VOLUNTEER THEN TO WORK LONGER
THE CAN AT THE MOMENT WELL WE ENJOY THE OPT OUT I SAID IT WAS A EUROPEAN UNION UPFRONT OF THE OF THE LAST OF THE OPT OUT THAT'S YOUR BIT CONCERNED JUDAH GAS FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU DEAL WITH HOW HOW EASILY CAN YOU
WELL THERE'S NO REGULATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED MY BUSINESS ADVERSELY IF ANYTHING IT'S THE OPPOSITE REGULATIONS SUCH AS PROTECTED PROTECTION OF TRADEMARKS THE FACT THAT I CAN REGISTER A TRADEMARK ACROSS TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES UNDER ONE FORM IS INCREDIBLY EMPOWERING FOR BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN TERMS OF THINGS SUCH AS THE WORKERS' DIRECTIVE WHILE I RUN A BUSINESS WHERE EMPLOY FACTORY WORKERS AND I'M SUPPORTIVE
LEGISLATION SUCH AS THAT WHICH PROTECTS THE WORKERS AND ALSO THEREFORE PROTECTS MY BUSINESS AND I'VE BEEN A BUSINESS TWENTY SIX YEARS AND IN THAT TIME I'VE STILL NOT FOUND THIS THING CALLED RED TAPE COMING FROM THE Y. I THINK IT'S A MYTH THERE ISN'T ANY SUCH THING AS RED TAPE OF PRESUMABLY DEPENDS SLIGHTLY ON WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS I SUPPOSE AND HERE YOU HAVE TO EMPLOY THE TETRA WOULD YOU ACCEPT
TOOK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD THE OTHER SPEAKER TALKING ABOUT THE WORKERS' DIRECTIVE NOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT NEGATIVELY OR POSITIVELY AS YOU QUITE RIGHTLY MENTIONED YOU CANNOT TOWN IT'S A SENSIBLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION COMING OUT OF THE I SUPPOSE I MEAN WORK WHERE WE COME TO THE END OF THIS WE'VE GOT
AND SOON BECAUSE OF OUR TIME RESTRICTION WHERE WE COME TO IS REALLY BACK TO YOUR KIND OF GUT FEELING ISN'T IT SIMON BOYD YOU'RE SORT OF POLITICAL
FEELING YOUR SENSE OF SOLVENT THAT DOES THE THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT SUCH A JOB IN THE BUSINESS SECRETARY'S GOING TO BE MAKING TODAY AND OTHERS HAVE MADE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT IS IS THAT THE THING THAT REALLY DOES SWINGY OR IS IT JUST YOUR GUT FEELING IT YOU DON'T LIKE BEING IN THE OPINION
WELL LOOK IT'S THE REALITY FOR US I MEAN I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW WHAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE SEA MARKING WHICH IS WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT I MEAN THE CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS REGULATIONS THAT'S THE REGULATION THAT AFFECTS US THAT'S A COMPLETE AND UTTER WASTE OF TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN A BUILDING HAS BEEN WELL DESIGNED IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOT A GOOD STAND OF THE SAFETY ONLY SIX PERCENT OF BUSINESSES EXPORT INTO THE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF US HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE REGULATIONS
AND TO WHAT CONTAINED DIRECT WAS JUST ONE EMITS THAT THREATENED REMOVAL OF THE OPT OUT THAT'S SO DAMAGING AND I'M FED UP FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST BAD REGULATIONS AND BAD DIRECTIVES AND POLITICIANS CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO GET BAD REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES FROM WESTMINSTER BUT AT LEAST WE AT LEAST WE CAN VOTE THESE PEOPLE OUT AND ISN'T THAT THE POINT THAT'S WHAT A COME DOWN TILL ISN'T AS WHETHER YOU DO YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF THINGS BEING DECIDED COMPLETELY AT WESTMINSTER OR NOT
BUT THINGS IN YOU ARE BEING DECIDED BY BRITISH POLITICIANS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING FOR BRITAIN'S INTERESTS AND THE BEST WAY THEREFORE IN A GLOBAL MARKET PLACE IS TO BE PART OF THE LARGER FORCE AND IN TERMS OF
THE THE ISSUES ABOUT BEING CONTROLLED BY WESTMINSTER I HAVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN SOUTH YORKSHIRE THAT WE'LL GET A BETTER DEAL WE'VE HAD MASSIVE BENEFITS
AS AN OBJECTIVE ONE WE HAD FROM THE E.U. IN TERMS OF RE GENERATING A DEPRIVED AREA WHERE THERE'S BEEN MANY LOST LOST JOBS WITH STEEL AND WE IT NOW SIMON BUT I'M SORRY WE GOT A LIVE WITH EGGS WERE OUT OF TIME THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AND WE'LL BE EXPLORING ALECIA ACTUALLY ABOUT HELP FOR AREAS THAT NEED HELP FROM CORNWALL LATER ON IN THE WEEK JULIA GASH AND SIMON BOYS AS WELL THANKS
TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT ROB GETS VERY ANNOYED WHEN WE WAITING AT AUREUS DRUMMING IS SPEAKING COMING OUT OF MY EARS GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALISTAIR COOKE'S ACHIEVEMENT IN REACHING TEN THOUSAND TEST RUNS AND IN BEING THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN OF THE YOUNGEST INTERNATIONALLY TO DO SO AS DRAWN PRAISE OF COURSE FROM THROUGHOUT THE ENGLISH GAME CAME AS YOUR SIDE WON THEIR SECOND TEST AND THE SERIES AGAINST SRI LANKA IN CHESTER LE STREET NO MARKS FOR IDENTIFYING COOK AT THE TOP OF THIS CRICKETING VOX POP BUT SEE HOW YOU GET ON WITH THE OTHER THREE
HE WAS A GREAT NIGHT I KNOW IT'S VERY SELFISH FOR ME TO SAY THERE WAS A GREAT MOMENT FOR ME YOU DO HAVE A LITTLE THINGS PERSONALLY WHICH YOU GET DRIVEN BY TO SCORE TEN THOUSAND WAS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE GOALS IT YOU WANTED TO ACHIEVE YOU ALL THAT HARD WORK THE EFFORT HE SHOULD TREASURE IT COS IT IS AN INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT AND THE YOUNGEST TWO TO TEN THOUSAND IN THE HISTORY OF TEST CRICKET IS JUST INCREDIBLE
HIS EXAMPLE TO EVERYONE NOT JUST PEOPLE PLAYING AT THE TOP LEVEL BUT YOUNGSTERS AS WELL HE KNOWS HIS GAME HE'S BEEN VERY DETERMINED TO STICK TO HIS STRENGTHS AND IT PROVES THAT THAT WORKS AT THE TOP LEVEL THE GUY IS THIRTY ONE THEY CAN THE FIVE OR SIX YEARS THERE'S AN OPENING BATSMAN TO GO PAST THAT MILESTONE FASTER AND YOUNGER THAN ANYONE ELSE IS REMARKABLE IN ITSELF
I DO BELIEVE THAT HE CAN NOW GO ON AND PROBABLY CHASE URCHINS ALMOST SIXTEEN THOUSAND RAMS THAT'S WELL WITHIN HIS GRASP THAT WOULD BE QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT WOULDN'T IT FOUR OUT OF FOUR IF YOU'VE GOT COOK JIMMY ANDERSON STUART BROAD AND SIR IAN BOTHAM WITH ANDERSON ALSO IN THE NEWS AS MAN OF THE MATCH WITH EIGHT WICKETS WHICH TOOK HIM PAST A CAREER TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE OUT OF THE FRENCH OPEN TENNIS COMPLETELY WASHED OUT YESTERDAY AND IN SOME DANGEROUS SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY AND SO OUR FIRST QUESTION TO TENNIS CORRESPONDENT MUSCLE FULLER IN PARIS IS ABOUT THE WEATHER RUSSELL HOW'S IT LOOKING
STILL RAINING ROB BUT IT HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST THIRTY SIX HOURS BUT THE FORECASTERS SAY IT SHOULD EASE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS THERE WILL BE SHOWERS BUT I THINK WE'LL GET A DECENT CHUNK OF PLAY TODAY OH KAY WILL WIN AND HAS A ROOF ON IT CENTRE COURT THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN IS ALSO COVER THE U.S. OPEN WE'LL HAVE A COVERED COURT THIS YEAR BUT PLANS AT A GARAGE FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR HAVE BEEN DELAYED HIS TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR FOR FORGERY
IT WILL HAVE THE ROOF IN TWENTY TWENTY SIT A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD BUT WE ARE THE LESS GRAND SLAM WHO HASN'T GOT A ROOF
AND WILL WE GET TWO DAYS OF RAIN YUSIF FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS PEOPLE QUEUING IN TRYING TO SHELTER AND HAVE THE STATIONS AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING VERY NICE WELL IT'S ALL A BIT EMBARRASSING FOR THE FRENCH OPEN THIS ISN'T IT
I THINK THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR A ROOF D. FOR J. HAS BEEN VERY VERY OPEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S UNACCEPTABLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE NOT TO HAVE A ROOF HE WAS ASKED IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE THE OTHER DAY WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO BUILD A ROOF IN FRANCE AND HE SAID WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE YOU SHOULD DIRECT THAT QUESTION TO THE PRESIDENT ON DIARY POO BLEAK HE'S REALLY USING HIS BAD WEATHER TO STEP UP HIS CAMPAIGN TO PERSUADE THOSE THAT STILL HAVE OBJECTIONS THAT IT'S
GIVE YOU FOR THAT IMAGE OF THE SPORT AND ALSO BY EXTENSION OF FRANCE TO WELL HE BUILT THE MOTORWAYS AND THEIR RAILWAY SYSTEMS QUICKLY ENOUGH DON'T THEY BUT ANYWAY ON TODAY'S TENNIS ANDY MURRAY AGAINST GAS GAY IN A GRAND SLAM HE'S NEVER LOST MARYLEE SECOND SEED GASK A. NIGHT SEED BUT GAS THEY WILL HAVE THE CROWD BEHIND HIM
YES AND THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE BUT MURRAY DOES ENJOY BEING THE PANTOMIME VILLAIN IT'LL BE A DAVIS CUP STAR ATMOSPHERE IN THE PAST RICH A GASKET LIKE A LOT OF FRENCH PLAYERS HAS NOT ENJOYED THE PRESSURE AND THE ATTENTION OF ROLAND GARETH HE'S NOT WANTED TO PLAY ON THE MAIN SHOW CAUGHT THE FILLET SHATTERING A COURT WHERE THEY WILL PLAY TODAY WEATHER PERMITTING BUT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED THIS YEAR HE'S REALLY EMBRACING THE OPPORTUNITY THE OCCASION DARE I SAY AT THE PRESSURE
I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF A REALLY REALLY GOOD YEAR SEMI FINALIST AT WIMBLEDON LAST YEAR QUARTER FINALIST AT THE U.S. OPEN AND HE BEAT KAYLEY SHE CALL IN THE LAST ROUND AND I THINK HE'D BE VERY DANGEROUS OPPONENT FOR MARIE OH KAY RUSSELL WILL LEAVE IT THERE RUSSELL FULLER IN PARIS AT THE FRENCH OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH RACING TIPS AND TOASTER TO FORTY NUMBER THREE NORTH LIGHT LINGFIELD SIX TWENTY NUMBER TWO JUNGLE BACK

YOU HAVE ACCUSED VOTE LEAVE OF MAKING UNFUNDED SPENDING COMMITMENTS TOTALLING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS THEY SAY A CALL BY BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS FOR THE SCRAPPING OF V.A.T. ON FUEL IS FANTASY LAND ECONOMICS THERE LEAVE CAMP SAY REMOVING V.A.T. WOULD HELP POORER FAMILIES BUT ISN'T POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF E.U. RULES
AN INQUIRY INTO HISTORICAL CHILD SEX ABUSE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS DUE TO BEGIN EXAMINING ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE KING CORA BOYS HOME IN BELFAST IT'S EXPECTED TO LOOK AT CLAIMS THAT A PAEDOPHILE RING AT THE HOME HAD LINKS TO THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

THANK YOU TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE AN AUSTRALIAN FAMILY FACING POSSIBLE DEPORTATION FROM THE U.K. HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY CAN STAY UNTIL AUGUST BUT THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED TO WORK CATHERINE BRAIN HER HUSBAND GREG SON LACKLAND MOVED TO THE HIGHLANDS IN TWENTY ELEVEN ON A STUDENT VISA THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO THAT BUT THE RULES LATER CHANGED THEIR M.P. THE S. N. PEAS IN BLACKFORD SO THE LATEST HOME OFFICE RULING WAS ASTONISHING
THE WAY THE COULD YOU DIPPY IT'S SIMPLY ROT ON AND IT JUST SEEMED ABSOLUTELY
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO GREG BRAIN STARTED BY DISCUSSING WHY CAME IN FIRST PLACE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE CAT OR DRESS CAME OVER HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE ON A HOLIDAY NEXT WEEK ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PLACE THEN CAME OVER TWO THOUSAND FIVE IS A SORT OF A LOGISTICAL RESEARCH EXERCISE TAKE THE HOLIDAY MAKERS GLASSES OFF AND JUST MAKE SURE IN TERMS OF COST OF LIVING AND OTHER ISSUES THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO COME OVER HERE AND MOVE ON
THEN CAME OVER IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN SO THAT KEPT YOU COULD STUDY FOR HER DEGREE NOW WE'VE GOT VISA FOR THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ME EVIE FOR EVEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE REGARDING THAT ITS CONTINUATION OF THE POST STUDY WORK VISA SO WHEN WE CAME OVER HERE THAT WAS PART OF A LONG TERM PLAN THAT THE HOME OFFICE OFFERED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OVER HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND
OR OFFERING THAT YOU A BEEZER IN MANY YEARS' TIME YOUR STUDENT DAYS WERE FINISH THAT YOU COULD STAY ON FOR A FURTHER TWO YEARS AND WHAT CHANGED THE YEAR AFTER WE ARRIVED IN THE BACK THAT WAS TWO YEARS AFTER WE GOT OUT OF THESE
THE GOVERNMENT DISCONTINUE THE POST STUDY WORK VISA AND IN ITS PLACE IS WHAT THEY'RE CALLING THE TIER TO WORK THESE ARE WHICH IS A FAR MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS WHICH YOU HAD COME IN ON THE PREVIOUS VISA
WHY IS IT THEN THAT YOU ARE STILL POTENTIALLY BEING THROWN OUT WELL IF I CAN QUOTE FROM DON'T BROKEN
HE SAID THAT APPLICANTS SHOULD NEVER ASSUME AT THE PROVISIONS IN PLACE AT THE TIME OF THEIR INITIAL ENTRY TO THE U.K. WILL CONTINUE TO BE VIABLE OPTIONS IN FUTURE YEARS UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT STATED POLICY ON THE MATTER IS TO BE UNTRUSTWORTHY IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH IMMIGRANTS WHAT WILL IT DO TO YOU WELL AT THE MOMENT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY HOME WANTS BUT FOR THE CHARITY OF FRIENDS WERE UNEMPLOYED AND THEIR PASSPORTS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED
THE HOME OFFICE HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL BE WRITING TO THE D.V.L.A. RECOMMENDING THAT IT WASN'T AS BECAME THOUGHT THAN THE CONSIDERING FREAKING HER BANK ACCOUNT WHAT STASIA IN THEN AS A FAMILY WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT WE'LL HAVE THE SEVEN YEAR OLD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT SHE'LL WIN HIM TO A DEGREE WE'RE JUST DOING AS BEST WE CAN WE'RE TAKING UP AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE AND COMFORT FROM THAT
THE SUPPORT OF FRIENDS THAT WE'VE HEARD EM SUPPORT RIGHT ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM FROM LABOUR GREENS AND S.N.P. HERE IN SCOTLAND EVEN CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE SPEAKING AND UP OVER WHAT
YOU MENTIONED YOUR SON LACKLAND WHOSE WHOSE FIRST LANGUAGE IS GAELIC IS THAT RIGHT IT IS THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF
CONTROVERSY OVER THAT THAT BECKWITH CAME UP FROM THAT FROM THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPER WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE PUT FORWARD BUT THAT SAID HE SPEAKS GAELIC AND ENGLISH WITH EQUAL FACILITY HOWEVER HIS FORMAL EDUCATION HAS ONLY BEEN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF GALLE AT THE TEACHERS ONLY SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY AT ORDERS GAELIC INTO ENGLISH IS NOT INTRODUCED UNTIL B. OR SO BY A NARROW MARGIN YES GO ACCUSES FIRST LANGUAGE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AND SOMEBODY SAID LOOK THIS IS TOUGH
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY YOU'RE VERY UPSET ABOUT IT AS A FAMILY BUT ULTIMATELY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO CHANGE HIS MIND AND AUSTRALIA IS NOT NOT
A BALL UP A BAD PLACE TO BE SENT BACK TO MANY MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO'D LIKE TO BE LIVING IN BRITAIN WOULD BE IN FAR WORSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT I WOULD SAY USE THAT BRITAIN PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE RULE OF LAW
THAT WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THE U.K. GOVERNMENT I THINK YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT YOU WILL BE DEALT WITH HONESTLY AND ETHICALLY THE DEAL THAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THEM WHEN YOU ARE HOLD YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN THEY WOULD A HOLD THERE
UNFORTUNATELY AS JAMES BROKEN TOYS WHERE THERE SEEMS TO INDICATE HE SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT MAKING THAT ASSUMPTION IS A DANGEROUS THING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY THE GREATEST SEA BATTLE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS FOUGHT IN THE NORTH SEA OFF JUTLAND IT PROVED TO BE A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT PROVING THE GERMAN NAVY WAS UNABLE TO BREAK THE BRITISH BLOCKADE OF GERMAN PORTS AND SO UNABLE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM SLOW ECONOMIC STRANGULATION THOUSANDS OF SAILORS DIED ON BOTH SIDES THOUGH THEIR FATE OR SOMETIMES OVERSHADOWED BY THE SLAUGHTER ON THE WESTERN FRONT NICK I'M REPORTS
GREAT TONGUES OF FLAME SHOT OUT FROM HER RIBBON SIDE THE MAST COLLAPSED THE SHIP BROKE INTO AN ENORMOUS BALL OF BLACK SMOKE
ROSE TO THE SKY REAR ADMIRAL WILLIAM CHALMERS IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE LOOKING BACK ALMOST FIFTY YEARS TO THE MOMENT THE BRITISH BATTLE CRUISER INVINCIBLE WAS HIT BY A GERMAN SHELL OF THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND ONE MOMENT SHE WAS THE PROUD FLAGSHIP FULL OF LIFE INTENT ON HER
THE NEXT SHE WOULD JUST DO SECTION BUT TWISTED METAL STANDING UP OUT OF THE WATER LIKE TWO LARGE TOMBSTONE
THE TOMBSTONE STOOD FOR SEVERAL HOURS THE BROKEN SHIP RESTING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHALLOW NORTH SEA ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY SIX SAILORS DIED ALL BUT SIX OF HER CREW
MANY OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AT JUTLAND ARE COMMEMORATED ON THE ROYAL NAVY MEMORIAL OVERLOOKING THE SETTLEMENT AT PORTSMOUTH
THEY INCLUDE SAILORS FROM THREE BATTLE CRUISERS NOT JUST INVINCIBLE THAT BLEW UP AND SAY
SO THERE'S THE COMMONWEALTH WAR GRAVES COMMISSION IS CHIEF HISTORIAN THESE WERE HUGE
MORE THAN A THOUSAND OFFICERS AND MEN ON BOARD THEY WENT DOWN AND MERE MOMENTS IT WAS INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC INCREDIBLY BRUTAL AND VERY SHOCKING FOR THE NAVY AND ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED THE BATTLECRUISER FLEET WAS COMMANDED BY A POOL DAVID BEATTIE
THE FIRST SHIP IN THE LINE THE QUEEN NOW THEY'RE KEPT IN FRANCE BLEW UP I WAS TURNING THE FIND DAVID
AND WE BOTH TURNED ROUND IN TIME TO SEE THE UNPLEASANT
THAT'S ALFRED CHATFIELD THE CAPTAIN OF B.T.'S FLAGSHIP THE LION RECORDED IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT
THE VORTA A MINUTE FRIEND IN HER BREATH THROUGH MY FEED IT
HATFIELD IS IT TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT BLOODY SHIPS TODAY B.T.'S FAMOUS REMARK FEATURES IN AN EXHIBITION ON JUTLAND AT THE ROYAL NAVY MUSEUM IN PORTSMOUTH
THE MUSEUM'S NICK HEWITT SAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH BEATTIE'S FAST BUT VULNERABLE BATTLE CRUISERS WHICH SANK WHEN SHELLS PENETRATED THEIR THIN ARMOUR AND IGNITED THEIR MAGAZINES THERE WAS A TENDENCY TO GET SEDUCED BY THE WORD BATTLE AND OVERLOOKS THE WORD CRUISE THESE WERE DETAINED TENDED TO BE SUPER CRUISERS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ROAM THE OCEANS HUNT DOWN ENEMY RAIDERS THEY WERE BUILT FOR SPEED THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO STAND UP IN THE LINE OF FIRE AGAINST ANY BATTLESHIPS
ATTRACTIONS AT SEA WERE MEANT TO BE FOUGHT BETWEEN THE HEAVILY ARMOURED DREADNOUGHT BATTLESHIPS FOR BRITAIN AND GERMANY HAD BEEN RACING TO BUILD IN THE EVENT THE LEADING DREADNOUGHTS IN ADMIRAL JELLICOE'S GRAND FLEET
AND ADMIRAL SHEARS HIGH SEAS FLEET EXCHANGED FIRE FOR LESS THAN TEN MINUTES BEFORE SCHEER TURNED HIS HEAVILY OUTNUMBERED SHIPS AWAY THE FIRST GREAT DREADNOUGHT BATTLE IN HISTORY TURNED OUT TO BE AN ANTI CLIMAX AND THERE WAS NEVER ANOTHER
THE OUTCOME OF JUTLAND WAS CONTESTED THE GERMAN FLEET REACHED PORT FIRST AND QUICKLY PROCLAIM TO VICTORY IN THE BATTLE OF THE SKAG ORAC HE WOULD AGAIN THIS IS GERMAN FOR THIS MEDALLION CELEBRATING VICTORY TO SCATTER ACT IT'S A PICTURE OF A CHAP CLUBBING SEAL CLUBBING SEALS YES SAY THAT THE SEALS OF THE ROYAL NAVY AND THE SEAL CLUBBER THE SEAL HUNTER IS THE GERMAN NAVY BUT IT WASN'T THAT SIMPLE THE GERMANS HAD HOPED TO LIFT THE ROYAL NAVY'S ECONOMIC BLOCKADE THEY FAILED
AGGERS COME STEM IS THE AUTHOR OF JUTLAND NINETEEN SIXTEEN THE BRITISH LOST MORE SHIPS THEY LOST FAR MORE MEN THANKS TO THOSE BATTLE CRUISERS BLOWING UP SIX THOUSAND CASUALTIES TO TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND GERMAN WENT BUT BATTLES AND CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT ACTUALLY WON BY A BODY COUNT ALONE AFTER
JUTLAND AT THE GERMANS WERE VERY LOATH TO GO TO SEA AFTER JUTLAND THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO WIN STARVATION AND SHORTAGES WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEIR TOLL
JACK FLETCHER WAS A LEADING STOKER ONBOARD H.M.S. LION HE SPENT THE BATTLE TOILING IN THE HEAT AND DIRT BELOW DECKS SHOVELLING COAL FIFTY YEARS LATER HE RECALLED THE BATTLE'S GHASTLY AFTERMATH THEY GOT UP THERE AND WHEN WE GET IN THAT FLAT I THOUGHT I'VE GOT INTIMATE SMITHFIELD MARKET
IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT THEY HAD TO DO WE HAVE A SET ON THE MESH TABLE AND THE WATER ALL AROUND US COULD FLAB IN THE DEXION DIRECTION OF FIRE
AND WE'LL SIT AND WATCH THINGS GOING ROUND AND DID DE BOXES AND GOD KNOWS WHAT BITS AND PIECES I TOLD IT IT IT WAS A REAL STINKER
I WAS NICK HIGHAM REPORTING ON THE JUTLAND IT IS NINETY MINUTES TO NINE LET US GO BACK TO SCOTLAND HOW WE'VE BEEN HEARING ARE REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING'S PROGRAMME FROM JIM OR IS THEIR LATEST SERIES REPORTS ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE AS IT IS BEING SEEN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND GEMS IN GLASGOW THIS MORNING HELLO AGAIN
YES MORNING AGAIN JUST ANOTHER TEN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN DEBATE IN SCOTLAND IS INFLUENCED INEVITABLY BY REFERENDA MEMORIES FROM EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO AGO WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND THAT HELPS TO SHARPEN THE SENSE THAT THE CAMPAIGN HERE
IS SHAPED BY SELF AWARENESS IN SCOTLAND SOMETIMES MAYBE SELF OBSESSION TOO WELL HOW'S THAT RELATED TO THE PERSISTENT MESSAGE FROM OPINION CERVIX THAT SCOTLAND IS IN GENERAL KEENER TO REMAIN AND THE REST OF THE U.K.
IS IT CULTURE IS IT ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST OR WHAT I'M JOINED BY BUSINESSMAN ALICE MACMILLAN WAS PART OF THE LEAVE GROUP
BUSINESS FOR BRITAIN SCOTLAND AND ALSO BY DOCTOR DOUGHNUT OWEN DUDLEY EDWARDS NATIONALIST BY INCLINATION AN IRISHMAN OF COURSE WHO'S TAUGHT AND WRITTEN IN SCOTLAND FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE AND OWEN DUDLEY EDWARDS WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION
RELATIVELY SPEAKING AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THE E.U. U. IN SCOTLAND THAT APPEARS TO BE AT LEAST AT THIS JUNCTURE GREATER THAN IT IS ELSEWHERE IN THE U.K.
WELL ONE THING WE COULD TAKE FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF IRELAND IRELAND WENT INTO THE EAGLE AND LOVED IT PARTLY BECAUSE IT HAD SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND ANGLE OF PHOBIA NO I DON'T THINK THE SCOTS DISLIKE THE ENGLISH AS MUCH AS THE IRISH DID EARLIER IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THAT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T DO NO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE SCOTS IN CERTAIN WAYS FIND THE ENGLISH RULE RULE FROM WESTMINSTER SOMETHING GETTING IN THE WAY
OF SCOTTISH SELF REALISATION AND FROM THIS POINT IF YOU HAD THE EASY YOU'LL INTERVENES IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS WHICH MAY BE THE SCOTS MAY FEEL IT'S TO THEIR ADVANTAGE PARTICULARLY THIS WORKED OUT WHEN WINIFRED EWING WAS ELECTED EARLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AFTER THE S.N.P. HAD LOST A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN POP
AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SO THAT FROM THE BEGINNING IN A SENSE WHEN WINIFRED EWING WENT TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IT BEGAN TO MEAN AN AWFUL LOT MORE TO THE SCOTT FOR ONE THINK SHE WAS TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AS M.E.P. FOR THE MINISTER FOR THE HIGHLANDS FOR M.E.P. FOR THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS IN GETTING A LOT OF GRANTS AND USEFUL SUPPORT FOR THAT PART AND IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT THE S. AND P. TURNED ON ITS AXIS AND INSTEAD OF HAVING BEEN
AN ANTI EUROPEAN PARTY WINNING SEATS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES ON THE BASIS THAT THE HEATH TERMS OF ACCESSION WERE BAD IT BECAME A EURO ENTHUSIAST BARTY AND STILL IS EUROPEAN ENTHUSIAST BOY VERY MUCH SO INDEED AND WINIFRED EWING OF COURSE DID A SPLENDID JOB IN
PUBLICITY ONE MIGHT BE UNKIND TO SAY FOR HERSELF BUT SHE WAS CARRIE IN EUROPE WHISTLER SHE LIKE TO BE CALLED MADAME LATE COS WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE WAS MADAM
WHEN PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OF THOUGHT OF WINIFRED EWING AND AFTER HER AND HE MAY BE AS GOOD AS PROFESSOR SO NEIL MCCORMICK THE GREAT AND UNFORTUNATE NO RECENTLY DEAD ROBERT LAW PROFESSOR AT EDINBURGH WELL INDEED ALISTAIR MACMILLAN LET ME BRING YOU IN AT THIS POINT FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE YOU YOU WANT TO LEAVE YOU THINK IT'LL BE BETTER AS A BUSINESSMAN WHO EXPORTS FROM SCOTLAND AROUND THE WORLD
BUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IN SCOTLAND THE TONE OF THE DEBATE IS IS MORE TILTED TO REMAIN PERHAPS THAN IT IS OUT OF ORDER
I DO ACCEPT THAT
THERE ARE AS PROBABLY AT THE MOMENT A MAJORITY TO REMAIN BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE SCOTS ARE PER SE LES EUROSCEPTIC
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SCOTLAND AS PARTNERS VERY MUCH ALTHOUGH PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
IT HAS A VERY SHORT OVER APPROACH TO NEWSPAPERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE VERY MUCH LUKE FAR MORE LOCAL AND THE FORMAL ORDER AND THE MEDIA UP
NORMOUS NUMBER OF LOCAL NEWSPAPERS WHICH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARY COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE U.K. AND I THINK AND THE MEDIA'S VERY MUCH MORE DEFERENTIAL AND ADDED TO WHICH
THE EURO SCEPTICISM HAS BEEN SEEN AS A SORT OF TORY DISEASE
SCOTLAND WE'RE NOT TORY CONSERVATIVES ARE NOW THE SECOND PARTY AT HOLYROOD OF COURSE AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THAT AND IT'S TO GET YOU BOTH IN ON THIS IS THAT IT'S DAVID'S IN THE LEAD OR READ A VERY GOOD CAMPAIGN IN THE HOLLYWOOD PARLOUR
ALTHOUGH SHE SAID SHE SHE GOT ALL SORTS OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST BRUSSELS SHE IS LEADING HER PARTY
NOT UNITED OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO LEAVE BUT IT'S NOT YOUR NIGHT OF THAN THE PARTY SAYS TO THE BOARD BORDER THIS WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION FOR THAT WELL FOR ONE THING FAVOURITES FAVOURITE I SHOULD HAVE SENT FOR VERY VERY PRACTISED CAMPAIGNER AND REALLY IN THE VERY USE OF A GENERAL SENSE OF GAY LIBERATION AND SCOTT
DOESN'T KNOW SHE'S GETTING MARRIED LESBIAN PARTNER BUT I THINK PEOPLE WARMED TO HER VERY STRONGLY THERE IT SEEMED TO UNLIKE TRADITIONAL TORYISM OFTEN WONDER WHAT SIR ALEC DOUGLAS HUME WOULD MAKE OF THAT BUT IT'S ALSO I THINK VERY IMPORTANT TO REALISE THAT THROUGH STAVERTON CAMPAIGN VIRTUALLY WITHOUT EVER MENTIONING DAVID CAMERON OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY AVOID IT DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS ARGUMENT HERE ALISTER MACMILLAN IS TIED UP WITH THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN A WAY THAT CAN'T BE DISENTANGLED I THINK THAT PEOPLE
THAT THEY'RE TOLD BY LABOUR BY THE S.N.P. IN PARTICULAR THAT EUROPE IS A GOOD THING AND THEY'VE YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK TO THE FISHING COMMUNITY YOU LOOKED AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY THAT HAVE ACTUALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH
EUROPE FIRST HAND YOU KNOW THEY SAY THEY ARE THINKING SCOTTISH FARMER POSE SAYING SIXTY NINE PERCENT WANT TO COME OUT YOU KNOW THAT FOR FISHING PEOPLE YOU'RE VERY SONG IT'S STEEPLE
WE HAVE UP HERE NORMAL ORDINARY PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF IMMIGRATION FROM THE E.U. WHICH ARE SOUTHERN COUSINS TO THE SAME EXTENT AND I THINK
THAT IS YEAH THAT'S TRUE AND YOU THINK THAT INFLUENCES AT THE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU OWEN DUDLEY EDWARDS IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT IF THERE WERE A VOTE TO LEAVE ACROSS THE U.K. PARTICULARLY IN SCOTLAND A MAJORITY OF VOTES HAD SAID REMAIN THAT NICOLA STURGEON WOULD BE UNABLE TO RESIST
THE PRESSURE IN HER PARTY FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YES VERY MUCH SO I MEAN HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT EX IMPLICIT BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING WAS THE REFERENDUM WAS CARRIED AGAINST INDEPENDENT ON THE ASSUMPTION WILL WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING HER PUP HAS TOO MUCH THAT MATTERS WOULD REMAIN AS THEY WERE
THE WHOLE BALL GAME TO BE CHANGED BY THE U.K. GETTING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST SCOTLAND WISHES WOULD MAKE IT OVERWHELMING THAT DEMANDS I THINK FOR INDEPENDENT TO BE VERY RESIST OR DIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY TO RESIST
WE SHALL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE TWENTY THIRD ALISTAIR MACMILLAN OWEN DUDLEY EDWARDS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THANK YOU GEM TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE LET US STAY WITH MATTERS EUROPEAN BECAUSE VOTE LEAVE HER BE MAKING QUITE A LOT THIS MORNING UNDER GOING TO DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY OF THE IDEA THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ONE OF THE THINGS WE COULD DO WOULD BE TO CUT V.A.T. ON FUEL BILLS QUITE A BIG SAVING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MUCH CASH AND CAN VERY MUCH TO DO WITH THE MONEY ON THE OTHER HAND THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN NOW SAYING THAT THAT IS ONE OF
MANY COMMITMENTS THAT THAT LEAVE PEOPLE ARE MAKING THE ROAD JUST SIMPLY UNFUNDED LET'S TURN TO NORMAN SMITH AGAIN OUR SYSTEM FOR EVITA AS WHO'S ON THE LINE WHAT WHAT DO THEY REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAYING ABOUT THOSE COMMITMENTS NORM WELL THEY'VE DONE JUSTIN IS THEY'VE TRAWLED THROUGH ALL THE PRESS RELEASES QUOTATIONS STATEMENT BY ITS STATEMENTS BY SENIOR BREAKS IT FIGURES
AND LOOKED AT ALL THE THINGS THEY SAID COULD BE DONE IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ALL SORTS OF AREAS BEARDS IN THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS PENSIONS THE DEFICIT YOU NAME IT TOTTED UP ALL THOSE PLEDGES AND COME TO A WHOPPING GREAT SUM OF ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION TIMES WHICH THEY SAY THE BRAKES OF CAMP OF PROMISING THE SAVING ACTUALLY IS WHAT EIGHT BILLION INDEED AND SAYING WELL YOU'RE SOME SIMPLY DON'T ADD UP
IT'S HARDBALL POLITICS FRANKLY BUT ARE GIVEN EXAMPLES THEY SAY THEY SIGHT A QUOTE ON THE VOTE LEAVE YOUTUBE SAYING LET'S IMAGINE WHAT ELSE THIS MONEY COULD BUY HUNDREDS OF NEW SCHOOLS AND THEN REMAIN OF JULIE TOTTED UP THE COST OF HUNDREDS OF NEW SCHOOLS WHICH COMES TO THREE BILLION POUNDS BUT THEY ARE I THINK TRYING TO POINT AT WHAT THEY SEE
AS AS AS A HABIT IF YOU LIKE OF THE BRICKS AT CAMP WHICH IS OF REPEATEDLY ILLUSTRATING HOW MONEY COULD BE DIFFERENTLY SPENT THERE BY IMPLYING THAT ALL THESE THINGS COULD BE A ACHIEVED BUT NOT SAYING IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR IS IT COS THEY'RE SAYING IS ARE WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS PERHAPS ONE OR TWO OF THESE THINGS IF WE HAD OUR OWN MONEY IT DEPENDS HOW YOU VIEW IT I THINK JUSTIN THEY ARE SAYING THE BRAKES A COMPASS AND THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL ILLUSTRATIONS THE QUESTION IS IF YOU ILLUSTRATE SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SAYING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WHICH IS DISPUTED THAT WE GIVE TO THE Y. YOU COULD BE SPENT ON THIS IT COULD BE SPENT ON THAT A VOTERS THEREBY LEFT WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THESE THINGS COULD BE DONE OR IS IT SIMPLY AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW WE COULD DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS I SAY MY SENSES IT IS EXACTLY LIKE A GENERAL ELECTION WHEN WE GET THESE SORT OF MASSIVE DOSSING AS WITH THESE HUGELY INFLATED FIGURES WHERE EVERY QUOTE BY EVERY SPOKESMAN HAS PICKED UP AND THEN ROCKET BOOSTERS PUT UNDER THEIR CLAIM TO COME UP WITH A BIG FIGURE THE WHOLE LOT
PUT TOGETHER AND THEN SLACK DOWN THERE SOME GROSS COST THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY IF WE DID THIS ALL THAT TOMORROW IN THERE STILL TO COME THOUGH THE THANKS THAT IS TEN TO NINE THE HOT TO ME GLADDEN AT THE SIGHT OF A MEADOW FULL OF WILD FLOWERS BUT SHOULD WE BE MORE DISCERNING AND MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT SHOULD GROW WHERE THE CHARITY PLANTLIFE THINKS ON MEADOWS ARE TOO GENERIC AND IS SENDING GUIDON GUIDANCE OUT TO HELP PEOPLE WORK OUT WHAT MIX OF FLOWERS SHOULD BE SOWN IN THEIR AREA
WE'RE JOINED FROM BANGER BY DOCTOR TREVOR DINES WHO'S THE BOTANICAL SPECIALIST AT PLANT LIFE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MUCH SHOULD A MEADOW VARY DEPENDING ON WHERE IN THE COUNTRY IT IS THIS IS THAT THE REAL MAGIC OF WILDFLOWER MEADOWS AND WE ALWAYS SAY THAT IF YOU WERE TO PARACHUTE
BOTANIST BLINDFOLD INTO A MEADOW THEY SHOULD ALMOST BE ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHERE IN THE COUNTRY THEY ARE FROM THAT MIX OF FLOWERS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL HAVE A NORFOLK MEADOW THAT'S FULL AT THE MOMENT OF HAVE GREEN WINGED ORCHIDS AND PEPPER SAXIFRAGE AND THAT'LL THAT'S GOT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND FEEL TO IT TO TOMAS AND MEADOWS LITTLE
BUTTERFLY ORCHIDS AND WORLD CARAWAY IN AND IT'S THIS MAGIC THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TRY AND CONSERVE SAID THAT MAGIC NOT REALLY EXIST SO MUCH TODAY IN THAT IF YOU WENT FROM NORFOLK TO TELL MORE THAN YOU WOULDN'T FIND THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TODAY THE THING IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR WILDLIFE IS IN HE'S IN SICKLY SEVERE DECLINE ESPECIALLY SORT OF FARM AND WILDLIFE AND NATURAL RESPONSE TO THAT IS IS TO REACH
OR MAYBE A GENERIC PACKETS OF SEED AND USE THAT TO RESTORE THE FLOWERS IN THE LANDSCAPE AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN THESE MEADOW MIXTURES CONTAIN MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY VARIETIES OF FLOWERS WHERE IS A SORT OF ANCIENT HISTORIC MEADOW WILL HAVE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT SPECIES IN IT SO RATHER THAN HAVING THESE THESE IDENTICAL MEADOWS
BUCK MEADOWS AS WE'RE CALLING THEM SPREAD AROUND THE COUNTRY LET'S TRY AND HOLD ONTO SOME OF THAT MAGIC AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THESE ALL OF THE SPECIES
SUPPORT THOSE UP THAT OTHER WILDLIFE SO ALL OF THE INSECTS AND THE BIRDS AND THE BUTTERFLIES AND THEN THE PIECE THAT WE'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT THEY ALL NEED A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES TO TO TO TO LIVE ON AND BY USING WHAT WE CALL IT NATURAL SEEDING TECHNIQUES WHICH IS OFTEN BRINGING IN SEED FROM THESE ANCIENT MEADOWS WE CAN WE CAN QUICKLY AND EASILY RESTORE
VERY LARGE AREAS OF MEADOW LIKE WE'RE DOING IN THE CORONATION MEADOWS PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE AND WE GET THAT INTEGRITY THAT SORT OF AUTHENTICITY SORT OF ABOUT IT'S ABOUT LETTING A WILD PLANTS DO THAT THING THAT THEY'RE THERE TO DO WHICH IS TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE OTHER WILDLIFE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND IF WE DON'T DO YOU WOULD SAY THAT WE WERE LOSING SOME OF THOSE SPECIES ALTOGETHER I MEAN SPECIES OF FLOWERS AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THEY'VE INSECTS YEAH WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IT USING VERY VERY LOCALLY SOURCED SEED
YOU END UP WITH WITH WITH MORE RESILIENT PLANTS THAT FLOWER BETTER THE FLOWER AT THE RIGHT TIME SO THEY'RE IN TUNE WITH ALL THOSE INSECTS AND WILDLIFE AROUND THEM AND IN FACT WE'RE FINDING THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN STAND UP TO CLIMATE CHANGES AS WELL SO SO IT'S ABOUT KEEPING SOME OF THAT LIKE SAY THAT MAGIC IN THE COUNTRYSIDE KEEPING IT LOCAL KEEPING THAT THAT IDENTITY THERE AND ALLOWING THESE PLANTS TO TO TO TO SUPPORT THE WILDLIFE AS WELL DOCTOR TREVOR DINES FROM OTHER PLANT LIFE CONSERVATION CHARITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
