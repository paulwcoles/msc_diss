CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE LEAD FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS THE LETTER THAT HAS EMERGED FROM A FORMER SENIOR MILITARY COMMANDERS SAYING ESSENTIALLY WE ARE SAFER IN EUROPE THAT IS THE TELEGRAPHS HEADLINE THIS IS THE SECOND LETTER IN TWO DAYS THAT IT HAS BEEN PARTLY COORDINATED BY DOWNING STREET
AND THE FORMER DEFENCE YOU SAY BRITAIN MUST STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THAT IT CAN PROTECT ITSELF FROM GRAVE SECURITY THREATS POSED BY EYESORE AND A RUSSIA AT THE THIRTEEN ARMED FORCES CHIEFS SAY FORMER ARMED FORCES SAY THEY BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST TO REMAIN AN E.U. MEMBER THE SIGNATORIES INCLUDE FIELD MARSHAL LORD BRAMALL OF FORMER CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STUFF HE'LL MARSHALL LORD GUTHRIE ALSO FORMER DEFENCE CHIEF AND SIR MICHAEL ROSE FORMER
GENERAL SIR MICHAEL ROSE FORMER DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL FORCES THE MAT CARTY AND ON THE FRONT PAGE SAYS AND TO A SERVICE PERSONNEL PILOT SUNNY NEXT TO A FIGHTER JET SAYING I'M PREPARED TO TAKE ON ICE WILL BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED INTO A TORY PARTY WALL OVER THE E. THE TIMES AS AN NEXT STORY OF AN EXTRAORDINARY LETTER THAT WAS SENT OUT BY SURREY'S YOUTH LEAGUE CHAIRMEN
WHO AND THERE'S THE PAPER PUTS AT THAT VIOLENCE ON THE TOUCHLINE AT CHILDREN'S FOOTBALL GAMES HAS BECOME SO SERIOUS SOMEONE MAY SOON BE KILLED ACCORDING TO THIS LETTER AND THE MAN IS WRITTEN TO PARENTS APPARENTLY OVER THE WEEKEND IT THIS IS JUST ONE WEEKEND OF USE MATCHES IN SURREY A PARENT THREATENED TO STAB A REFEREE ANOTHER HEAD BUTTED A VOLUNTEER LINESMEN
AND YOUNG PLAYERS SPURRED ON BY THEIR MANAGERS THREATENED TO SMASH UP A CHANGING ROOM AT LEAST THREE GAMES HAD TO BE ABANDONED AND THIS MAN AND HIS LETTER MET MAKES THE POINT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN THIS IS ABOUT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER ON THE TOUCHLINE IT DID TO A LINESMAN AT A CHILDREN'S MATCH IN THE NETHERLANDS THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO IF THIS CONTINUES I FEAR THIS MAY BE THE RESULT HERE AND THE LEAD FOR THE GUARDIAN IS JUNIOR DOCTORS DECLARING A FRESH WAVE OF STRIKES
THEY SIGNAL DEFIANCE AGAINST JEREMY HUNT THE HEALTH SECRETARY FOR INGLE ENGLAND ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THE DATES PLANNED FOR THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION WHICH WILL NOT AFFECT EMERGENCY CARE OF A NIGHT OF MARCH THE SIXTH APRIL AND THE TWENTY SIXTH OF APRIL ALL ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT EIGHT A.M. AND THIS TIME THEY ARE THREE NEW FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKES BUT I WAS THERE TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD ANOTHER VICTORY IN THE LAST HOUR REPUBLICANS IN NEVADA HAVE BACK TIM IN THE LATEST U.S. PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TRUMP HAS BEEN ADDRESSING SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES HERE WE WEREN'T EXPECTING A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE WEREN'T EXPECTED TO WIN THIS ONE YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT
OF COURSE IF YOU LISTEN TO THE PUNDITS WE WEREN'T EXPECTED TO WIN TOO MUCH AND OUR WINNING WINNING WINNING
SOON THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO STRIKE WINNING WINNING WINNING
DONALD TRUMP AND OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES COOK JOINS US NOW FROM NEVADA HOW BIG WAS THIS WHEN JAMES WELL THE RESULTS ARE STILL COMING IN BUT THE PRINT THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON THE PROJECTIONS BY THE U.S. MEDIA SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS A REALLY THUMPING VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP HERE IN NEVADA CONSIDERABLY BIGGER THAN HIS PREVIOUS WINS IN THE OTHER ESTATES WHICH HE HAS TAKEN IN THIS RACE SO FAR THAT IS TO SAY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA
I WAS A SAILOR THE PULLING DATA'S STILL COMING IN BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING AS WELL AS THE SUGGESTION FROM THE POLLING DATA BUT HIS POPULARITY EXTENDS PRETTY WIDELY ACROSS THE DEMOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM AND MISTER TRUMP HIMSELF WAS TALKING UP BUT
WHEN HE WAS MAKING HIS SPEECH A FEW MINUTES AGO SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP HE GOES MARCHING ON TOWARDS POSSIBLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S NOMINATION AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHAT ABOUT HIS RIVAL'S THERE DO WE KNOW YET WHO HAS COME SECOND
WELL I KNOW IS THE SHORT ANSWER ALTHOUGH MICHAEL REVEALED IT TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE AHEAD OF TED CLUES I'M ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO YOU FROM A TED CLUES RALLY AT THE MOMENT TO CONSERVATIVE VIDEOS WENT BECKET SAID JUST ON THE STAGE ABOUT TO INTRODUCE TED
HIS OWN IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IS CROWD CHEERING AND WAVING THEIR PLACARDS IN THE AIR HERE AS THEY AWAIT TEXAS BUT REALLY HE HAS A PROBLEM AND SO TOO DOES DONALD TRUMP'S PRINCIPAL RIVAL MARCO RUBIO AND THAT IS AS LONG AS BOTH OF THEM THAT REMAIN IN THE RACE AND OF COURSE OTHER CANDIDATES STRONG CASE HE COMPLAIN CARSON AS WELL THEN THE LONGER THE ANTI TRUMP FAULT IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT THE DUMP FROM VOTE
IS SPLIT AND THE MORE IT SUITS DONALD TRUMP WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
IS A FEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP ISN'T REALLY ONE OF THEM ISN'T REALLY A TRUE CONSERVATIVE AND WIGGLY REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS IF HE DOES EVENTUALLY GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE SO THEY ARE REALLY VERY WORRIED
HEARTY ESTABLISHMENT RALLYING AROUND MICHAEL RUBIO THEY DON'T MUCH LIKE TO CRUISE EITHER COS THEY REGARD HIM AS A BIT TOO EXTREME IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS AS WELL SO THESE ARE VERY VERY INTERESTING TIMES NOW BUT IN THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE RACE AND HE'S HAD SOME HIGH PROFILE WINS BUT WE'RE STILL RELATIVELY EARLY IN THE NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE HAD TO HAVE SIGNAL THEIR PREFERENCES
YEAH OF COURSE AND THAT IS WORTH POINTING OUT BUT I THINK WHAT THE POINT ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS IT'S RELEVANT IN THAT REGARD IS THAT THIS SUGGESTION THAT HE'S WINNING ACROSS ALL DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORY SUGGESTS THAT HE COULD WIN IN MANY OTHER STATES AS WELL EVEN THOUGH AS YOU SAY THAT A FORM OF BEEN FOR VOTING SO FAR WEARING TO SUPER TUESDAY NEXT THAT'S JUST COMING UP NEXT WEEK AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT ELEVEN STATES VOTING ON THE SAME DAY PRINCIPALLY
THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES THAT WILL BE A BIG MOMENT PARTICULARLY FOR TED CREWS WHO WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT IN THOSE PARTS OF THE U.S. NOT LEAST IN HIS HOME STATE OF TEXAS SO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG TEST JAMES COOK IN NEVADA THANK YOU
THE TIME NOW COMING UP TO FORTY MINUTES PAST SIX COLOGNE'S POLICE CHIEF YOGA NA MATTY'S HAS SAID THAT MANY OF THE MEN WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HUNDREDS OF WOMEN IN THE GERMAN CITY ON NEW YEAR'S EVE MAY NEVER BE CAUGHT THAT'S THE LEASH OFF LIQUORICE MY
I CAN'T EXCLUDE THAT THE C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY SEXUAL ASSAULTS WE CAN SEE SOME THEFTS BUT THAT'S ALL WE ARE RELYING ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS IT ON VICTIMS IDENTIFYING THEIR ATTACKERS JENNY HILL AS A CORRESPONDENT IN COLOGNE AND IT JENNY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY I THINK IT IS SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT MAY BE THAT NOBODY IS CONVICTED
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT LOOKS SINCE NEW YEAR'S EVE POLICE HAVE MANAGED TO IDENTIFY SEVENTY FIVE SUSPECTS THEY'VE ONLY MADE FOURTEEN ARRESTS AND ONLY ONE OF THOSE ARRESTS
IS IN CONNECTION WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT THE REST THE MAJORITY OF THESE SUSPECTS ARE SIMPLY IN CONNECTION WITH THEFT POLICE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE MOBILE PHONE FOOTAGE TAKEN ON THE NIGHT THAT IS REALLY THE ONLY EVIDENCE SPACE APART FROM OF COURSE WITNESS STATEMENTS STATEMENTS FROM THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN USING A TEAM OF SO CALLED SUPER RECOGNISES FROM SCOTLAND YARD SPECIALLY TRAINED VERY TALENTED POLICE OFFICERS WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE AND RECOGNISE PEOPLE WHO POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN
OFTEN FROM VERY BLURRED FACIAL IMAGES BUT WHAT THE POLICE ARE SAYING IS IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE A SEXUAL ASSAULT HAPPENING ON THAT FOOTAGE YOU CAN PERHAPS SEE SOMEONE'S POCKET BEING PITCH YOU CAN SEE SOMEONE'S BAD BEING SNATCHED BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY MAKE OUT A SEXUAL ATTACK AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY SAY THEY ARE REALLY ARE FACING WHAT WE DO KNOW IS SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE PROFILE OF OF MOST OF THE OFFENDERS ON THAT NIGHT THEY SAY ALL OF THOSE SEVENTY FIVE SUSPECTS IDENTIFIED
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE NORTH AFRICAN AND THE VAST MAJORITY THEY SAY ARE IN THE COUNTRY EITHER ILLEGALLY OR THEY'VE SOUGHT ASYLUM HERE SO WE ARE STARTING TO GET A SLIGHTLY CLEARER PICTURE OF THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED THAT NIGHT BUT WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO SEE ACCORDING TO THE PERSON THAT I THINK WILL REALLY SHOCK GERMANS ARE CONVICTIONS FOR THE HUNDREDS OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS SAID TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE THAT NIGHT AND THERE IS SOME REAL ANGER IN GERMANY AT THIS BUT OF THE WHOLE WAY IT HAPPENED AND BEEN TREATED
I THINK THIS REALLY HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT I THINK ON GERMANY FULL STOPPER THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS ARE HUGE THE GOVERNMENT HAS REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTENED I THINK BOTH ITS RHETORIC AND ITS RESPONSE TO THE MIGRANT CRISIS MANY PEOPLE OF COURSE FOLLOWING COLOGNE SAID THIS IS DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT ANGLE OR MICHAEL'S OPENED OR REFUTE REFUGEE POLICY HAS QUITE SIMPLY FAILED IN THE GOVERNMENT
HE'S LOOKING AT CHANGES SO FOR EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE DISCUSSING PLANS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DEPORT ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO COMMIT CRIME IN THE COUNTRY THEY'RE GOING TO DECLARE IF THEY CAN COUNTRIES LIKE TUNISIA MOROCCO AND ALGERIA SAFE COUNTRIES ORIGIN SO THAT MEANS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK ASYLUM
JENNY HILL IN THE COUNTRY THANKS VERY MUCH SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THERE IS A NEW PLAYER IN THE U.K. HOUSING MARKET AND A RATHER UNEXPECTED ONE SON JACK HAS MORE FOR US MORNING MORNING MICHELLE YES ONE OF OUR NEWEST HOUSE BUILDERS HE'S MORE ASSOCIATED PROBABLY WITH PENSIONS AND LIFE INSURANCE THAN BRICKS AND MORTAR BUT LEGAL AND GENERAL IS INTO PROPERTY IN A BIG WAY IT'S ALREADY SAID HE WILL BILL THREE THOUSAND APARTMENTS ACROSS THE U.K. UNDER A SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUND
BUILD TO RENT PLAN IT'S ALSO BUILDING A THOUSAND HOMES IN BRACKNELL IN BERKSHIRE AND IT HAS PLANS TO BUILD A HUGE FACTORY IN LEEDS THAT WERE CHURNED OUT THOUSANDS OF MODULAR HOMES NIGEL WILSON IS LEGAL AND GENERAL CHIEF EXECUTIVE GOOD MORNING JUST REMIND US OF THE STRATEGY TO PLACE A PENSION FUND PROVIDER IN THE HOUSING BUSINESS YOU'RE TAKING PENSION MONEY AND USING IT TO BUILD NEW HOMES WHICH THE PENSION FUNDS WILL OWN AND THEN RENT IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S PART OF IT YES BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF SHELLED MONEY WE HAVE LOT WITH VERY LONG
THE U.K. IS STILL A GREAT PLACE TO INVEST AND WE WOULD LIKE TO INVEST MORE OF THAT MONEY HERE IN THE U.K. AND WHY AND WHY IS THIS IS THIS AFTER ECONOMIC RETURN STEVE SEE ARE YOU TRYING TO DO YOU KNOW CRACKED OR SOCIAL ILL WHAT'S THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS I THINK WOULD PROBABLY TRYING TO GET ECONOMIC RETURNS OUT OF IT AT THE U.K. HOUSING MARKET IS A VERY UNUSUAL MARKET AROUND THE WORLD WHERE THERE'S BEEN THIRTY YEARS OF UNDER INVESTMENT AND WE HAVE TO HELP FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY OF PRODUCING HOUSES FOR FOR PEOPLE RIGHT ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. AND DOES THAT MEAN BUILDING IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD THEM WHY IT'S DIFFERENT YEAH WE LOOK AT THE PROBLEM SOMETH THUMP FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM IN BRITAIN'S NOT AGGREGATE DEMAND THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF DEMAND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE WERE SIMPLY NOT BUILDING ENOUGH
THEREFORE COULD BE BUILD THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO I'M SOMEWHAT IRONICALLY WE WENT RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE AND FOUND THE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS EUROPE SEEN THESE HOUSES THAT YOU SEE ON GRAND DESIGNS AND PROGRAMMES LIKE THAT AND I FIGURED OUT HOW TO MANUFACTURED THEM IN BULK HERE IN THE U.K. THEY'RE AT A TREMENDOUSLY ECONOMIC ECONOMICALLY GOOD PLACE FOR CUSTOMERS AND SOME PEOPLE THINK THE POST WAR HOUSING CRISIS WE MANUFACTURED PREFABS AND WE'VE GOT LOTS OF STANDARDISE THINGS AND PEOPLE LOOK BACK AT THAT AND SAY
GOSH THAT WASN'T SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA WHAT KICKED IX WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT I THINK THESE ARE VERY HIGH QUALITY HOMES AND AND MANY WAS THE PREFABRICATED HOUSES TOOK PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY AND MANY THAN LASTED FOR MANY MORE YEARS THAN PEOPLE AT PEOPLE EXPECTED I WIN THAT SORT OF CRISIS DO YOU SEE IT AS A KIND OF WERE THE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS THERE WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A HOUSING CRISIS THAT'S EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A WE'VE NOW GOT A CRISIS WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS WE HAD A CRISIS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE
CAN'T GET ON THE HOUSING LADDER AND ONLY ONE PER CENT OF ALL THE HOUSES THAT WE WERE BUILDING AT THE MOMENT ARE SUITABLE FOR THE SENIOR GENERATION OF THE MATURE GENERATION HERE IN THE U.K. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO FIND THE PEOPLE TO BUILD THIS MANY HOUSES OBVIOUSLY NOW YOU HAVE IN THE PAST SAID IF WE CAN'T GET A GOOD DEAL IN THE Y. YOU LEAVING WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD I JUST WONDER WE'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND ENOUGH BRICKIES ENOUGH ELECTRICIANS BUILD THE HOUSES THAT WE NEED TO TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS
WHERE WE'RE GOING NO THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT A MASS PRODUCE THEM IN IN IN IN FACTORIES BECAUSE THAT'S THE THE THE THE MOST COST EFFICIENT MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE THESE THESE HOUSES AND IT WILL SUPPLEMENT THE EXISTING ACTIVITY THROUGH TRADITIONAL MET ME BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU WERE ASKED TO SIGN THIS THAT THE FACT THAT BREAKS IT
WOULD THREATEN JOBS AND INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN LEGAL AND GENERAL DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T SIGN THIS LETTER WE SAW IN THE TIMES YESTERDAY WHY NOT I THINK WE WE'VE DECIDED AS A BOARD THIS AT THE MOMENT THERE'S TOO MUCH HEAT AND NOT ENOUGH LIGHT ON THE SITUATION SO THAT WE SHOULD STAND BACK AWAY LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AROUND THE SITUATION DEBATED WITH ALL OF MY BOARD COLLEAGUES RATHER THAN ME INDIVIDUALLY SIGN SIGN ONE OF THESE MASS PRODUCED LETTERS WHICH SEEM INCREDIBLY POPULAR
AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WE WE WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND GIVEN A CONSIDERED VIEW YOUR K. IN THE PAST AS I SAY YOU SAID IF WE DON'T GET A GOOD DEAL FOR ME THEN WHAT THEN WE SHOULD CONSIDER LEAVING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE DEAL WAS IT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PRIME MINISTER DID A MUCH BETTER JOB NEGOTIATING A DEAL FROM EUROPE THAN OUR INDUSTRY DID ON SOLVENCY TOO SO THAT'S NOT REALLY ASKING THE ANSWER IN THE QUEST I THINK HE DID AS WELL AS IT COULD BE EXPECTED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN WE EXPECTED IT FORGET IT ENOUGH FOR YOU
SO IF THE BOARD DECIDE THEY WILL WRITE THE LETTER YOU'RE HAPPY PUT YOUR NAME TO THAT NOT IF THE BOARD WHATEVER WE COME TO IS A DECISION AS A BOARD THEN AMP IT'S A UNITARY BOARD AND I WILL ABSOLUTELY STEP UP TO THE PLATE IF THAT'S WHAT OUR BOARD WANTS IT THINKS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT HE'S A BORE DECISION NOT A LOT OF PERSONAL DECISION LET'S LET'S PUT NOTICED POSE THAT THE IDEA OF BREAKS IT FOR A SECOND YOU'RE I MEAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF THERE ARE THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM ACROSS EUROPE WORKING IN THE BUILDING TRADE AT THE MOMENT
IF WE WERE TO LEAVE FOR MANY OF THEM WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE THAT LABOUR POOL WOULD BE GONE AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED WORSE SOMETHING I THINK I THINK THIS IS THIS EMOTIVE ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE PUTTING FORWARD ON LOTS OF THESE ISSUES AT THE MOMENT AND SCAREMONGERING AS A POST PENDING A VISION
OF WE HAD WHEN WE HAVE THE BIG HOUSE BUILDERS ON HERE THEY SAY WE'RE RUNNING AT FULL TILT WE'VE PUT WE CAUSE CAN'T FIND THEIR WORKERS TO BUILD ANY MORE NO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU NEED A DIFFERENT PRODUCTION YOU KNOW THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN TERMS OF HOW WE PRODUCE CARS HAD THE NOT PRODUCE ENERGY IT'S ALL CHANGING AND HOUSING TO BE PART OF THAT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE FOR WE HAVE MUCH GREATER MASS PRODUCTION MORE ENVIRONMENT EFFICIENT OR COST EFFICIENT PURPOSE BUILT FOR THE CUSTOMERS SO YOU CAN HAND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN DESIGN OF EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT YOUR HOUSE TO LOOK OI APARTMENT TO LOOK
IN THE FUTURE THAT SUITS YOUR PARTICULARLY AND YOU'VE GOT THIS LINE THAT YOU SAY THAT BRITAIN ISN'T OVER DILL DEVELOP IT UNDER DEMOLISHED WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I THINK THERE'S HUGE OPPORTUNITIES IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY TOWN AND CITY ACROSS THE U.K. TO MODERNISE THEM THERE ARE LARGE PARTS OF MORE CITIES WERE WHICH SHABBY AND RUN DOWN AND NEED REGENERATION AND WE ARE WE ARE PREPARED TO INVEST TWO DIFFERENT FUNDS ACTUALLY BOTH OF ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS WHICH IS ALMOST ONE PER CENT OF G. D. P.
IN U.K. REAL ASSETS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO INFLATE THE PRICE OF AULD ASSETS WHICH IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD REAL ASSETS HERE IN THE U.K. THAT WOULD CREATE REAL JOBS AND SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS FOR REAL PEOPLE ROGER WILSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE LEGAL AND MANY THANKS FOR THAT RICHARD DUNBAR INVESTING DIRECTOR ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT IS MARKETS GUEST THIS MORNING MORNING RICHARD AND THE REAL ACTION I SUPPOSE YESTERDAY WAS STERLING IT DROP BELOW ONE DOLLAR FORTY CENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
YES I'M GOING TO PUT IN CONTEXT THE PINES DYING TEN PER CENT SINCE THE END OF LAST SUMMER AND SOME OF THIS AS BLACKS RELATED EVERY SCENE AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT I SUSPECT THE WORDS OF MARK CARNEY AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE HAD MORE IMPACT THAN THOSE OF BORIS JOHNSON AND ESSENCE EXPECTATIONS OF U.K. INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN PUSHED BACK AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
AND EVEN NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES WERE DISCUSSED BY THE GOVERNOR YESTERDAY AND AT THE SAME TIME INTEREST RATE RISES IN THE U.S. WE'VE SEEN AND LESS QUEUE HE ISN'T EXPECTED IN EUROPE AND THAT'S HAD CONSEQUENT IMPACT ON BOTH THE DOLLAR AND THE EURO MAKING THEM RELATIVELY MORE ATTRACTIVE SAME TIME WE'VE HAD THE CONCERNS AND BREAKS AT HOME IS INTERESTING WE SAY WE SHOULDN'T INTERPRET EVERY TWITCH OF STIRLING AS A BREAKS IT RELATED
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I SUSPECT FROM HERE BRECHT'S WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PINE AND INVESTORS WERE WARTS THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE POOLS ACCORDINGLY BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER ELEMENTS NOT LEAST A SOMEWHAT DIMINISHING FAITH AND THE EFFICACY OF THE VARIOUS QUANTITATIVE EASING POLICIES BEING PURSUED GLOBALLY WHICH ARE LIKELY TO HAVE
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON SOME OF THE THE BIG CURRENCY BLOCKS INCLUDING STERLING BUT I THINK AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST SIX TO NINE MONTHS STERLING COULD GET CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE
THOSE BIGGER CURRENCY BLOCKS THEIR VIEWS ON THE ON THE EFFICACY OF POLICY POM CENTRAL BANKERS AND THE REASON THAT WE KEEP ARE ALSO LOOKING AT STIRLING IS WE HAVE A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT MEANING OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE WORLD ARE NOT MAKING AS MUCH AS OTHER PEOPLE'S INVESTMENTS IN OURS AND THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP ATTRACTING PEOPLE TO FUND THE SHORT FORWARD WITH DEBT
BUT IT IT'S ONLY BECOMES A PROBLEM WHEN THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM WAS THAT EXACTLY AND THE U.K. HAS RARELY HAD A PROBLEM ON THAT FRONT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE THAT GEORGE OSBORNE CAN BORROW MONEY OUT IN THE MARKETS IT'S VIRTUALLY ZERO SO A STERLING IS WEAK AND THEY'RE STILL A REASONABLE QUEUE OF INVESTORS WILLING TO FUND THAT DEFICIT AND I SUSPECT THAT WILL CONTINUE WITH HIS CURRENT
ON THE TELLER BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU'RE THERE THERE IT IS THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AROUND HER BUT I SUSPECT CHARACTER OF STIRLING HAS BEEN CAUGHT SOMEWHAT IN THE CROSSFIRE OF THE BIGGER CURRENCY BLOCKS AS WELL AS THE FOCUS ON BRECK'S RICHARD DUNBAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED BEST DIRECTOR ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT RICHARD DUNBAR THERE NOW THE BEST PERFORMER IN THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED YES THEY WERE SLIGHTLY ODDLY THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ITSELF
WHO SHARES ENDED FOURTEEN PER CENT HIGHER AFTER HE CONFIRMED IT WAS IN DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OVER A MERGER OF EQUALS AS THEY DESCRIBED IT WITH GERMANY'S DEUTSCHE BOSS IT'S THE THIRD TIME THESE TWO HAVE TRIED TO STRIKE A DEAL FIRST IN TWO THOUSAND AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOR SO IS IT THIRD TIME LUCKY AND WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR THE EXCHANGES CUSTOMERS FOR FREDERICK PONDS IS MANAGING PARTNER AT THE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY GREY SPARK AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU HOW BIG A DEAL IS THIS
IT IS A SIGNIFICANT DEAL IN A SENSE THAT THAT COULD TRAY IT'S ALMOST TO PLAN YOU PLAN EXCHANGE COVERING BRITAIN GERMANY ITALY AS WELL
COVERING THE ENTIRE TRYING FROM TRADING ON EQUITIES BUT ALSO THERE ARE OTHER TIPS OH SO IT WOULDN'T CREATE A PAN EUROPEAN CHECK TRADING GROUP THEY PICKED A HELL OF A TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
I MEAN THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK BEYOND OBVIOUSLY GETTING SHOULDER APPROVAL FROM BOTH SIDES GETTING APPROVAL FROM THE REGULATORS AND THEY ARE THREE REGULATORS IN PLAY ARE OBVIOUSLY THE F.C.A. U.K. THE GERMAN REGULATOR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION NOW
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS OF LARGE MERGERS BETWEEN STUCK OR CHANGES WHERE STOPPED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO AVOID A CREATION OF DOMINANT POSITION NOW I'D BE
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEY MIGHT GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT JUST TO WHAT TIPPED TO ANCHOR LONDON WITHIN EUROPE POTENTIALLY THOU IF HUGH IF YOU TAKE THE SCENARIO OVER BREAKS IT
IT'S THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THE LONG BITS LOOK A CHANGE WHICH IS PART OF THE SAME GROUP OF THE DRUM STOP EXCHANGE THAT MEANS THERE ARE STILL OF ASIDE FROM THE EUROPEAN AUTHORITY
OF THE STOCK MARKET OH KAY HOLDS I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH HOW MUCH SWAY THE MERGER OF DEUTSCHE BOTH NON STOP CHANGE WOULD HAVE IN THE VOTERS' MINDS OF U.K. WHEN THEY COME TO WHEN THEY COME TO VOTE ON THIS THE COURSE WHENEVER YOU GET TWO MASSIVE PLAYERS COMING TOGETHER YOU CREATE COMPETITION CONCERNED IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS REALLY WOULD BE A DOMINANT PLAYER AND THAT WOULD BE A CONCERN YES
HOWEVER IF YOU COMPARED TO THE STATION
SIXTEEN AND TWELVE YEARS AGO THAT WAS BEFORE THEY WERE HIS ASIAN THE OPENING TO COMPETITION OF THE STOCK MARKET'S BUSINESS TODAY
ALL THE EXCHANGES IN EUROPE COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER YOU'VE GOT THE ALTERNATIVE PLAYER THE TRANSACTIONS FEES ARE THE LOWEST IN HISTORY SO THERE'S PLENTY OF COMPETITION ACTUALLY O.K. THAT CONCERN
NOT AS IF IT'S GONE ALL RIGHT FREDERICK BONZO MANAGING PARTNER AT GRACE PARK PONDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM SUSAN
THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOVE SAYS DAVID CAMERON'S DEAL ON THEIR TERMS OF BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. COULD BE CHALLENGED AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE IT HASN'T YET BEEN WRITTEN INTO AN E.U. TREATY IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE DECIDING TO CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE MY OFFICE TOLD B. B. C. THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT THE AGREEMENT HAD LEGAL FORCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT HE SAID THE EUROPEAN COURT WASN'T BOUND BY IT UNTIL TREATIES ARE CHANGED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE
THIRTEEN OF THE U.K.'S MOST SENIOR FORMER MILITARY COMMANDERS HAVE SIGNED A LETTER ARGUING THAT BRITAIN WAS SAFER IN THE E.U. AND BETTER ABLE TO MEET GLOBAL THREATS AT LEAST TO DEFENCE MINISTERS ARE BACKING THE LEAF CAMPAIGN
THE SEARCH IS CONTINUING FOR THREE PEOPLE MISSING AFTER HALF OF THE DECOMMISSIONED POWER STATION COLLAPSED AT DIDCOT IN OXFORDSHIRE YESTERDAY ONE PERSON DIED FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL
THE BUSINESS MAN DONALD TRUMP LOOKS TO HAVE WON THE LATEST ROUND OF THE RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES EXIT POLLS SUGGEST YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN THE NEVADA CAUCASUS IT'S HIS THIRD CONSECUTIVE WIN AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA
GREECE HAS LODGED A FORMAL DIPLOMATIC COMPLAINT AGAINST AUSTRIA AFTER BEING EXCLUDED FROM A MEETING OF BALKAN COUNTRIES ON THE MIGRATION CRISIS IN VIENNA TODAY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT IS WORRIED THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS WILL BECOME STRANDED THERE AS AUSTRIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS INCREASE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR BORDERS
WALES HAS BEATEN COMPETITION FROM MORE THAN TWENTY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO BECOME THE HOME OF THE NEW ASTON MARTIN CAR PLANT IT'S EXPECTED CONSTRUCTION AT THE SITE AT SAINT ATHENS IN THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN WILL START NEXT YEAR AND VEHICLE PRODUCTION IN TWENTY TWENTY
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS APPOINTED AN INDEPENDENT PANEL TO REVIEW AT HANDLING OF THE CASE OF PETER BOL A FORMER BISHOP WHO WAS LAST YEAR JAILED FOR SEXUALLY ABUSING YOUNG MEN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THE ENQUIRY WILL EXAMINE HOW MUCH THE CHURCH KNEW ABOUT PAUL AND WHETHER IT'S RESPONSE WAS APPROPRIATE
THE TIME TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE LORD CHANCELLOR MICHAEL GO HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S NEW DEAL WITH THE E.U. IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND COULD BE OVERTURNED BY EUROPEAN JUDGES NORMA SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN THIS IS SO OFTEN THE SOUNDS OF A DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID IT IS MISTER GOES VIEW IS THAT DEAL SO TORTUROUS LEE NEGOTIATED BY MISTER CAMERON AT THE BACK END OF LAST WEEK CANNON EFFECT BE RIPPED UP
BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN INCORPORATED INTO Y. YOU TREATERS AND THE EUROPEAN COURT WHICH IS THE SUPREME ARBITER OF E.U. LAW BASES ITS DECISIONS ON WHAT IS IN E.U. TREATIES THE NUMBER TEN ARGUMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THIS IS LEGALLY BINDING AND IRREVERSIBLE BECAUSE
THE DEAL HAS BEEN LODGED AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND IT TAKES THE FORM OF A SORT OF INTERNATIONAL CONTRACT WHICH CAN ONLY BE UNPICKED EVERY MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ALL TWENTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AGREED TO DO SO AND THE DOWNING STREET VIEW IS THAT NUMBER TEN WOULD ALWAYS VETO THAT SO IN EFFECT THEY SAY IT IS BINDING BUT
I MEAN THIS MATTERS MORE THAN A SORT OF ARCANE LEGAL DISPUTE IT MATTERS VERY DIRECTLY POLITICALLY BECAUSE THE CENTREPIECE OF MY CAMERON'S RENEGOTIATION NAMELY THE KERBS TO BENEFITS FOR E.U. MIGRANTS WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE CHALLENGED ALMOST AS SOON AS IT COMES INTO FORCE BECAUSE THE EXPECTATION IS CERTAINLY AMONGST A EURO SCEPTICS IS THAT
I DON'T KNOW POLISH TRADE UNIONS OR HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS OR CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAUX OR JUST PLAIN MISTER OR MISSUS ANGRY WILL CHALLENGE THE BENEFIT CURBS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY ARE DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST NON BRITISH WORKERS AND THAT THEY FLOUT
FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND THAT THEREFORE THEY WILL BE STRUCK DOWN BY THE EUROPEAN COURT IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE KEY PLANK OF MISTER CAMERON'S REFORMS IN EFFECT TO BE SAWN IN HALF ALMOST BEFORE THEY COME INTO FORCE AT QUICK WORD ON ANOTHER STORY THIS MORNING WHICH IS ON THE FRONT OF THE TELEGRAPH THAT SOME SENIOR MILITARY FIGURES ON THE SIDE OF STAYING IN
THIRTEEN VERY SENIOR FORMER MILITARY LEADERS WERE TALKING CHIEF THE DEFENCE STAFF ADMIRALS AIR MARSHALS FIELD MARSHALS ALL SAYING THAT THEY BELIEVE WE ARE MORE SECURE REMAINING IN THE E.U. THAT OF COURSE FOLLOWS THE LETTER WE HAD YESTERDAY FROM BUSINESS LEADERS AND I THINK IT POINTS TO WHAT NUMBER TEN WANT THIS REFERENDUM TO BE ABOUT THAT HIS TRUST I THINK BOTHER TRYING TO DO IS TO SAY LOOK WHO DO YOU TRUST ON THIS ISSUE DO TRUSTEES
MILITARY MEN DO YOU TRUST THE TOP BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ALSO DO YOU TRUST DAVID CAMERON SEEMS TO CAMERA KEEPS COMING BACK TO THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY ULTERIOR MOTIVE I'M STANDING DOWN THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS FOR ME BUT MY BEST JUDGEMENT AS PRIME MINISTER IS THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN IN OTHER WORDS TRUST ME AND I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE REFERENDUM AN ISSUE OF TRUST ROUND DO YOU TRUST DAVID CAMERON
OR BORIS JOHNSON DO YOU TRUST DAVID CAMERON OR NIGEL FOR RAJ AND TO MAKE THAT THE CRITICAL ARGUMENT WHICH THEY HOPE WILL SWING OPINION THEY'RE WAY NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THREE PEOPLE ARE STILL MISSING AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF A BUILDING AT DIDCOT POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE A CORRESPONDENT BEN MORE IS AT THE SCENE HOW ARE THEY GOING ABOUT THIS BEN GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ONGOING INSTABILITY ON THE SITE
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARCHING HERE OVERNIGHT IT IS OXFORDSHIRE FIRE AND RESCUE WHO ARE VERY MUCH IN COMMAND HERE AND THEY HAVE BEEN DRAFTING IN HELP FROM AROUND THE U.K. WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THESE USE OUR TEAMS COME IN THAT IS
URBAN SPECIALIST RESCUE TEAMS WITH SNIFFER DOGS THEY HAVE COME IN FROM PLACES LIKE THE WEST MIDLANDS AND FROM BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TO HELP WITH THIS OPERATION HERE IT IS NOT AN INCONSIDERABLE TOWER SEARCHING THIS HUGE PILE OF RUBBLE THE ESTIMATE SO IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FOOT HIGH WITH ABOUT TWELVE TONNES OF STEEL WERE CALL THEN MASHED AND MIXED IN WITH IT IS AS YOU MENTION EXTREMELY UNSTABLE AND THEY HAVE BEGUN TO SHORE IT UP
AND THEN ONCE THEY'VE SHOWN IT UP THEY CAN BRING IN THE SPECIALIST EARTH MOVING VEHICLES AND THESE TEAMS WITH THE SNIFFER DOGS TO TRY
THEY HOPE TO FIND THE THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL MISSING OR WHO THEY HOPE STILL ALIVE SOMEWHERE UNDER THAT BIG PILE OF RUBBLE AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ONE PERSON WAS KILLED DO WE KNOW YET WHY THE BUILDING COLLAPSED
WE DON'T THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE HAS BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE NOW HAVE SORT OF QUIET AND DOWN ON THE SPECULATION BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT
THE PEOPLE WHO THE MAN WHO TRAGICALLY DIED THERE FOR PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL IN THE THREE PEOPLE STILL MISSING WORKED FOR THE COALMAN GROUP WHICH WAS A DEMOLITION CONTRACT THEY WERE RIGGING AT THIS TURBINE HALL THIS THREE HUNDRED METRE LONG TURBINE HALL FOR DEMOLITION IN THE COMING WEEKS
IT IS BELIEVED OR WAS IN THE EARLY STAGES THAT SOMETHING'S OBVIOUSLY GONE WRONG WITH THAT PROCESS WHICH LED TO THE COLLAPSE OF HALF OF THIS BUILDING AND THE TRAGEDY THAT UNFOLDED BENMORE AT DIDCOT THANK YOU
THE TIME TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN THE QUEEN'S FORMER DOCTOR SIR RICHARD THOMPSON IS ONE OF SIX EMINENT PHYSICIANS CLAIMING THE PATIENTS ARE TOO OFTEN GIVEN USELESS AND SOMETIMES HARMFUL DRUGS THAT THEY DON'T NEED SO THE DRUGS COMPANIES CAN MAKE A PROFIT AND BRIM ELO IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM THIS IS QUITE A LIST OF CRITICISMS AGAINST THE BIG DRUGS COMPANIES AND THE WAY THE WHOLE SYSTEM OPERATES
YES REALLY WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS A QUESTION OF TRUST IN THE WAY THAT MEDICAL RESEARCH IS CARRIED OUT AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S TROUBLE THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR ENGLAND WHO LAST YEAR ASKED THE ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S SIR LOOK INTO THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MEDICINE AND ITS ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT HOW
EVIDENCE IS COLLECTED POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS HOW THEIR FINDINGS ARE COMMUNICATED IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND TO THE PUBLIC BUT THE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS BEING LED BY LONDON CARDIOLOGIST DOCTOR HAS SEEN MALHOTRA IS ARGUING THAT THE ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES IS ITSELF TO CLOSE TO INDUSTRY IN THAT IT IS PART OF A KIND OF MEDICAL RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT WHICH HAS BECOME PART OF THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WHAT DOES HE SUGGEST COULD BE DONE
WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS PRESENT IN WHAT HE WOULD REGARD AS A PROPERLY INDEPENDENT INQUIRY BY THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SOMETHING THAT IS IS NOT PART OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE HE SAYS AS YOU REFER TO THEIR ACERBIC ESSENTIALLY TOO MANY PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES BEING DISHED OUT AND THE PROBLEM THAT THAT'S LEADING TO IS THAT THEY'RE OFTEN
HARMFUL TO PATIENTS AND THAT THE U.K. REGULATORS AREN'T PROPERLY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC THEY TOO HE ARGUES A PART OF THE PROBLEM AND IT'S ALL TO DO WITH THIS THIS PERVASIVE AND WHAT HE REGARDS AS HARMFUL INFLUENCE OF THE FART AND PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY WHICH HE SET SAYS NEEDS TO BE CURBED WELL WE SHALL SPEAK TO HIM DOCTOR SEEN MALHOTRA AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT THE ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S ABOUT HALF PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING AND A RIBBON OH THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS BRITAIN IS A NATION DIVIDED ACCORDING TO THE TIMES WHICH HAS COMMISSIONED A YOUGOV POLL ON ATTITUDES TO THE E.U. THE RESULTS AT SAYS SUGGESTS THAT THE IN AND OUT CAMPAIGNS ARE CURRENTLY NECK AND NECK AND DAVID CAMERON'S ATTEMPT TO FOCUS ON THE THREAT THAT BRECHT'S IT MAY POSED TO SECURITY AND THE ECONOMY APPEARS TO BE WORKING AT REPORTS A SHARP FALL IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BACKING LEAVES SINCE HE STRUCK THE DEAL ON FRIDAY
THE INDEPENDENT QUOTES POLLING BY THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ALL THEY DEEPLY YOU'RE A SCEPTIC AND UNHAPPY WITH BRITAIN'S CURRENT MEMBERSHIP TERMS SIXTY PER CENT WHEN GIVEN A STRAIGHT CHOICE BETWEEN STAYING OR GOING THINK BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN THE UNION THE MALE USES ITS LEADER COLUMN TO CRITICISE THE CABINET SECRETARY SIR JEREMY HAYWARD'S INSTRUCTIONS TO CIVIL SERVANTS TO NOT HELP MINISTERS CAMPAIGN FOR BRECHT'S IT AND TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO OFFICIAL PAPERS ON Y. YOU MATTERS FOR THOSE SUPPORTING LEAVE
THE PAPER SAYS THEY APPEAR TO PLUMB NEW DEPTHS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPROPRIETY UKIP M.E.P. NATHAN GIL TELLS THE MIRROR THE EDICT IS THE GREATEST INSULT TO DEMOCRACY BECAUSE VOTERS WOULD NOT GET TO LEARN CRUCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP THEM MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION HE'D BETTER POINT OUT THE RULES ARE IN LINE WITH THOSE SET DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN DOWNING STREET HAS DEFENDED THE GUIDANCE TELLING THE TELEGRAPH THIS IS ABOUT HOW THE CIVIL SERVICE HAS A ROLE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY NOT
NOT TO SUPPORT PERSONAL POSITIONS ACCORDING TO THE LEAD IN THE GUARDIAN A FRESH WAVE OF STRIKES PLANNED BY JUNIOR DOCTORS REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF THE ALREADY BITTER AND LONG RUNNING DISPUTE OVER PAY WORKING HOURS AND PATIENT SAFETY BUT THE PAPER SAYS THERE IS A BELIEF IN WHITEHALL THAT ANGER OVER THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW CONTRACT WILL DISSIPATE ONE STOPPED AND START WORKING WITH THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS
THE SUN POLICE PUBLIC SYMPATHY FOR THE DOCTORS OUGHT TO BE BLOWN AWAY BY WHAT IT CALLS THE SICKENING NEW STRIKES THE PAPER ARGUES THEY'VE BEEN OFFERED AN EXTRAORDINARY DEAL AND SHOULD SHUN THE UNION AND THE WALKOUT BUT THE MIRROR PUTS THE BLAME AT THE DOOR OF THE HEALTH SECRETARY ACCUSING HIM OF POURING PETROL ON THE FLAMES OF THE DISPUTE
QUITE BEAUTY OF THE LAKE DISTRICT IS BEING DISTURBED BY AN UNLIKELY NEW BREED OF CRIMINALS ACCORDING TO THE EXPRESS IT REPORTS A POLICE ARE MYSTIFIED BY WHAT THEY CALL A GREY HEAD CRIME WAVE WHICH ARE SEEN SIXTY FOUR PENSIONERS ARE RESTED IN THE AREA IN THE PAST YEAR FOR CRIMES INCLUDING HARASSMENT AND SUPPLYING DRUGS A B.&B. OWNER TELLS A PAPER WHAT HE CALLS SAGA LOUTS ARE DRINKING TOO MUCH ACTING DISGRACEFULLY AND CAUSING A PUBLIC NUISANCE IN SOUTH CUMBRIA THEFT IS THE CRIME COMMITTED MOST BY OLDER PEOPLE AGE U.K. SAYS THIS COULD BE LINKED

IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO HAS CHALLENGED ONE OF THE CENTRAL PLANKS AND DAVID CAMERON'S CASE FOR BRITAIN REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE E.U. IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE JOINING THE CAMPAIGN MY GAVE US TOLD THE B. B. C. THE DEAL AGREED IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK ISN'T LEGALLY BINDING THAT'S OUR HEADLINE THIS MORNING
AND GOVERNMENT PLANS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY GIVEN TO OPPOSITION PARTIES AT WESTMINSTER CAME UNDER RENEWED ATTACK YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ONE LABOUR M.P. ACCUSED THE CONSERVATIVES OF FEATHERING THEIR OWN NESTS ARE CHARGED REJECTED BY THE MINISTER OF A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HUGHES REPORTS
THERE ARE SOME THINGS IT'S EASY TO GET PEOPLE TO REACH INTO THEIR WALLETS FOR CURING DISEASE SAY OR RESCUING KITTENS BUT FUNDING POLITICS WELL NOT SO POPULAR A MINISTER JOHN PENROSE PUT IT AT A TIME WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE OUTSIDE WESTMINSTER HAS HAD TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS WHY SHOULD POLITICIANS EXPECT TO BE TREATED DIFFERENT
FEATHERING THEIR OWN NESTS AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING TO CUT BY AROUND A FIFTH THE MONEY GIVEN TO OPPOSITION PARTIES TO HELP THEM SCRUTINISE MINISTERS AND REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS JOHN PENROSE SAID THE AMOUNT HAD GONE UP MASSIVELY IN RECENT YEARS ANTI WONDERED WHO KNEW HOW IT WAS USED HOW CAN IT BE RIGHT IN THE MODERN AGE FOR POLITICIANS TO EXPECT TO BE BUMMED A LOAD OF HARD TAXPAYERS' CASH
MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL SINCE TWENTY TEN FOR THE LABOUR PARTY FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT AT LEAST EXPLAINING HOW IT GETS SPENT NOW OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE FURIOUS AT THE CUT AND THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME IN A FORTNIGHT THAT LABOUR SHADOW COMMONS LEADER CHRIS BRYANT HAD INSISTED THE MINISTER COME AND BE QUESTIONED ABOUT IT FAIR MINDED PEOPLE WILL CONCLUDE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS DEVELOPING A NASTY AUTHORITARIAN STREET
AN OVERWEENING EXECUTIVE WANTS TO CRUSH ALL OPPOSITION
THEY'RE AFRAID OF STRAIGHTENING THE CONSERVATIVES HE SAID HAD BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY TO ACCEPT FORTY SIX MILLION POUNDS WHEN THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION AND THE COST OF GOVERNMENT SPECIAL ADVISERS HAD SOARED TO QUOTE THE MINISTER HIMSELF
WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE TREATED ANY BUT DIFFERENT FROM THE OPPOSITION FEATHERING THEIR OWN NEST THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING IT'S NOT JUST LABOUR THAT'S ANGRY THIS WAS THE LIB DEM TOM BRAKE WHAT HE'S PROPOSING ISN'T ACTUALLY ABOUT THE COST OF POLITICS BECAUSE IF IT WAS HE'D ALSO BE PROPOSING A CUT IN THE BUDGET FOR SPECIAL ADVISERS THIS IS ACTUALLY ABOUT GAG IN THE OPPOSITION
WHEN THE MINISTER SCRAP THIS RUSHED CONSULTATION ABANDON THE ATTACK ON THE SCRUTINY OF GOVERNMENT AND LOOK AGAIN AT HOW THE COST OF POLITICS CAN BE REDUCED BY INCLUDING FRIENDS SINCE CHOPPING THE BUDGET FOR SPECIAL ADVISORS BUT THE MINISTER JOHN PENROSE HAD LOTS OF OTHER IDEAS FOR CUTTING THE COSTS NOT ALL OF THEM WILDLY POPULAR WITH HER PEAS
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF CUTTING HIS RIGHT THE COST OF POLITICS WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN FRONT OF US PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF M.P.S IN THIS HOUSE AS AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO LIMIT WHAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO
TO THIS THE S.D.L.P. IS ALISTAIR MACDONNELL SAID THE MONEY WASN'T FOR POLITICIANS IT WAS FOR THOSE STAFF BUT THEY FACED A BIG CUT THE CHANCELLOR'S SPENDING ON SPECIAL ADVISERS OR SPUDS HAD SPIRALLED
THE CHANCELLOR ASPIRED TEAM MISTER SPEAKER NO COSTS MORE THAN THE TOTAL COST OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT GRANT GIVEN TO ALL OF US HERE
THE D.U.P. PLAYED COM ROOM SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY THE S.D.L.P. THE CHANCE FOR A BIT MORE THAN WE GO NOW THE PROPOSED CUT MAKE SOME CONSERVATIVES A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE TO THIS WAS THE CHAIR OF THE TREASURY COMMITTEE ANDREW TYREE WHO SAID HE'D ARGUED FOR MORE MONEY FOR THE OPPOSITION WHEN LABOUR WAS IN POWER I FEEL BUT
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY BEFORE ARGUING FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT
THIS NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED THIS DECISION FOR FACTORY TRADE SUBSTANTIALLY CUT AND HE SAID IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO INTRODUCE THE HOLE CUT IN ONE YEAR BUT THE FORMER TORY NEITHER UKIP M.P. DOUGLAS CAR AS WILL WHO'S TURNED DOWN FUNDING TOLD THE MINISTER TO STICK TO HIS GUNS THE SITE OF SPECIAL PLEADING FROM POLITICAL PARTIES WANTING TO GET BACK ON TAXPAYERS' CASH HIS DISGRACE
THERE'S NOT ONLY TO SLASH SHORT MONEY WHEN PRINCESS THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLISH FULLY AUDITED
WHAT THEY SPEND THAT MONEY ON AS MY PARTY WILL BE GOING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR SO HE CAN SEE THE HOTEL BILLS AND WATER WHO'S THEY SPEND THAT TAXPAYER MONEY ON PRECISELY A CONSERVATIVE MATTHEW OFFERED SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING AN ELEMENT OF PERFORMANCE RELATED PAY AT LEAST FOR THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
GIVEN THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST TAKE YOUR POSITION MONEY AWAY COMPLETELY
AN IDEA THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A MOMENT OF STARTLED SILENCE IT WAS GOING A TRIFLE TOO FAR FOR THE MINISTER WHO SAID THERE WAS A PLACE FOR FUNDING PROVIDING IT WASN'T EXCESSIVE TO MAKE SURE THE OPPOSITION COULD FUNCTION
REPORTING AS MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT SHORTLY AFTER HOPPER STATE ON ONE MANIC LONG WAVE AND OR DIGITAL RADIO THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FIFTY ONE PER CENT OF DISABLED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM PLAYGROUP SO PLEASE SPACES THAT'S THE STOCK FINDING OF A REPORT RELEASED TODAY BY THE DEAFBLIND CHARITY SENSE WHICH SAYS DISABLED CHILDREN ARE MISSING OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES VITAL FOR THEIR EMOTIONAL SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
THE INQUIRY WAS CHURCH BY CHAIRED BY LORD BLUNKETT AND BY LESLEY ROGERS WHO'S EIGHT YEAR OLD DAUGHTER RUBY HE'S DEAFBLIND LESLEY'S IN A RADIO CAR THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING AND WHAT DID THE PARENTS OF DISABLED CHILDREN SEE US AS PART OF THIS REPORT
UM VARIOUS THINGS REALLY ONE SHOCKING RESULT WAS THAT PARENTS WERE TURNED AWAY FROM PLAY SCHEMES BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY DISABLED WHICH IS ACTUALLY DISCUSSED IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND WAS THAT HAPPENING BECAUSE THE STAFF FELT THEY COULDN'T PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN
I DO I THINK IT WAS VARIOUS REASONS PUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH CHANGING FACILITIES OR THE EQUIPMENT WASN'T SUITABLE FOR THE CHILDREN I MEAN IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME PERSONALLY BUT LOOK AT THE
THE REPORT THERE IS QUITE QUITE SHOCKING EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY FROM ORDINARY PLAYGROUPS AND PLAY SCHEMES WHAT WHAT HAS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH RUBY BINNED LIKE HOW WHAT WHERE THE SORT OF FACILITIES THAT YOU THAT YOU FOUND WERE AVAILABLE TO HER
WELL BETWEEN THE AGES NOUGHT TO FIVE REALLY WASN'T ANY FACILITIES FOR RUBY TO GO TO
I DIDN'T FEEL I COULD TAKE HER TO A REGULAR PLAYGROUP THAT I COULD TAKE MY SON TO WHEN HE WAS OF A SIMILAR AGE BECAUSE LOOBY WOULD BE OVERWHELMED AND ANXIOUS AND STRESSED AT THE THE NOISE AND THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN THAT WERE THERE
AND I AS A PARENT YOU FEEL THAT PEOPLE ARE STARING AT YOU AND ASKING YOU QUESTIONS WHY YOUR CHILD IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR MAYBE THEIR CHILDREN CHILDREN STARE SAY NASTY COMMENTS PARENTS PARENTS ASKING YOU WHY YOUR CHILD IS DIFFERENT
YEAH I HAD AN INCIDENT WHEN I WAS DROPPING MY SON OFF AT SCHOOL ONE MORNING AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NEW OUT OF HOSPITAL SHE ONLY BEEN OUT OF HOSPITAL FOR THREE MONTHS
SHE HAD A FEEDING TUBE WHICH WAS ALWAYS INSERTED INTO HER MOUTH BECAUSE SHE HAD FEEDING PROBLEMS AND REGULAR THAT I'D KNOWN PROBABLY FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS
WHO OBVIOUSLY KNEW HOW WAS EXPECTED AND I'D HAD MY BABY THAT HADN'T BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY RUBY WAS SID HOSPITAL ACTUALLY TURN ROUND THERE SAID TO ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER IS SHE NORMAL
HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS VERY VERY UPSETTING VERY DISTRESSING YOU JUST DO YOU YOU JUST HAVE TO GET VERY TOUGH YOU HAVE TO HARDEN UP WITH PEOPLE'S COMMENTS AND STARING AND YUKI SAID HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO TAKE HER TO
ORDINARY MAINSTREAM PLACE SPACES DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED AS A AS A COUNTRY WE NEED MORE DEDICATED SPACES OR DO WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE OPEN AND AWARE ABOUT ABOUT CHANGING OF MAKING EXISTING MAIN THREE SPACES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO DISABLED CHILDREN
WELL I THINK IF THE PLAY SCHEMES ARE THERE AND RUN IN AT THE MOMENT THEN OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD MAKE SENSE ESPECIALLY WITH WITH FINANCES AS THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT TO ACTUALLY MAKE THOSE SCHEMES
MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE THE CHILDREN NEED TO PLAY IN THEY NEED TO PLAY FOR A VERY EARLY AGE
AS WAY OF LEARNING ALL ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM SO IF THE PLAY SCHEMES ARE THERE ALREADY WHY NOT JUST ADAPT THEM PUT SOME KEY WORKERS IN THERE SOME SKILLED PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOW TO ACTUALLY
TREAT OUR CHILDREN AND TALK TO PARENTS ABOUT US WITHOUT AN CONCERNS LESLIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MY PLEASURE THANK YOU TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN BRITAIN IS SETTING A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO THE WORLD BY UNDERMINING HUMAN RIGHTS THAT'S WHAT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL IS CLAIMING IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON THE STATE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORLD WHICH IS OUT TODAY IT'S CRITICISE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO GET RID OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT
TO RESETTLE RELATIVELY FEW REFUGEES HERE AND ITS PROPOSED NEW SPINE LAWS KATE ALLEN IS DIRECTOR OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL U.K. SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THIS CRITICISM OF THE REMOVAL OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT I MEAN WE'RE EARLY DAYS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'LL BE REPLACED WITH WHATEVER WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT IT'S ALREADY DOING DAMAGE
THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LEADING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS HAVING GONE MAD AND THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT NEEDS TO BE REPEALED IS NOT ONE THAT'S TAKING PLACE
AS A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW CAN WE PROTECT OUR RIGHTS IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE DRAW BACK FROM THOSE SO IT'S A VERY NEGATIVE CONVERSATION AND IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN DRAWN UPON BY OTHER COUNTRIES SO WE SEE IN RUSSIA LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN PASSED RECENTLY ALLOWING THEM TO IGNORE INTERNATIONAL COURTS WE'VE SEEN PRESIDENT KENYATTA KENYA QUOTE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE U.K. AS HE URGES HIS PARLIAMENT TO IGNORE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
IT IS PART OF SOMETHING THAT WE AS AMNESTY OR SEEING GLOBALLY WHERE THE LEGISLATION IN THE INSTITUTIONS UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING UNDER ATTACK AGAIN IN THE GAME BY GOVERNMENTS AND WASTING GOVERNMENT JOIN IN THAT THAT IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT ARGUE THAT IT'S COMPARABLE OR THAT IT MAKES THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO RUSSIA WHAT THE U.K. IS DOING IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IT REALLY DOES IN THE U.K.
AND THE REPUTATION OF THE U.K. IN THE WORLD ON THESE ISSUES IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT AND YOU KNOW AS I TRAVEL FOR AMNESTY AGAIN AND AGAIN I HEAR THE GOVERNMENT SAY WELL IT'S O.K. FOR THE U.K. GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO AND IT'S USED NOT JUST ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT IT'S USED ON THE ISSUE OF REFUGEES WILL COME ON TO THAT JUST A SEGMENT ON THE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH A BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS WHAT YOU'RE CRITICISING SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT WE'VE HEARD VARIOUS RUMOURS ABOUT IT BEING LESS WHAT IS IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AT THE MOMENT THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL BE THEIR RIGHTS WILL NOT BE PROTECTED AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE DESPERATELY WORRYING IF THE U.K. DECIDES THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE QUESTION OF REFUGEES THE DECISION THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN
IS TO SPEND MONEY IN THE REGION AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH THE U.K. SPENDING WHICH IS MORE THAN A BILLION POUND SECOND ONLY TO THE STATES AND FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAT SURELY IS IT A CREDITABLE THING TO DO IT MAY NOT BE DOING TAKE MOVING REFUGEES WHO HAVE STARTED TO MOVE BUT IT'S HELPING THE MILLIONS WHO ARE IN THE IN THE REGION
IT IS AND IT'S IT IS A VERY BRILLIANT CONTRIBUTION AND WE AMNESTY HAVE PRAISED THE GOVERNMENT FOR THAT BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH IT SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT WE ARE IN THE BIGGEST REFUGEE CRISIS IT'S THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR THERE ARE FIVE MILLION REFUGEES FROM SYRIA AND WE ALL SEE SERIA EVERY SINGLE DAY ON OUR TELEVISIONS IT IS APPALLING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THAT COUNTRY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE FLED
NOW WHEN I'VE BEEN IN LEBANON AND I'VE BEEN ON THE THE BORDERS BETWEEN LEBANON AND SYRIA AND SEEN THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE LIVING IF I'VE BEEN IN THOSE CAMPS FOR THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS I WOULD UP YOU CAN TAKE MY FAMILY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THERE IS WHERE THE U.K. IS FADING IT IS NOT JOINING UP WITH THE REST OF EUROPE IT IS NUMBERS ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE U.K. SHOULD TAKE AN ADDITION TO WHAT IT'S DOING IN THERE
I'M RELUCTANT TO PUT THIS PUT A PARTICULAR NUMBER GIVEN IT A BALLPARK BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT TWENTY THOUSAND OVER FIVE YEARS WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MILLION REFUGEES THAT CAME OUT WHAT NUMBER WHAT NUMBER WOULD AMNESTY BE HAPPILY WITH I DON'T WANT TO PUT A NUMBER WHERE I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS A EUROPEAN RESPONSE TO THIS SO FAR WE'VE SEEN ONLY GERMANY AND ONE OR TWO OF THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES PLAY THEIR ROLE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KAY
PROMPTING THE REST OF EUROPE AND WORKING WITH THE REST OF IT UP TO HAVE A PROPER REGIONAL RESPONSE TO THIS KATE ALLEN OF AMNESTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU COMING UP TO TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN CHRIS FORKS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FOR US THAT'S GOOD MORNING WELL WE'RE LOOKING THE FREEZING COLD START TO THE DAY TEMPERATURES ARE MANAGED TO GET DOWN TO MINUS SEVEN DEGREES CELSIUS IN A FEW SPOTS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND BUT THE FROST IS HARD AND IT IS WIDESPREAD THIS MORNING WE DO HAVE SOME PARTICULARLY COLD WEATHER THIS MORNING

USE INFLUENCE ON EVERY DAY OBJECTS BUT LISTENING TO TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE HAS GIVEN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE JOINING THEM JOINING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM TELLING THE B. B. C. THAT THE REFORM DEAL SECURED BY DAVID CAMERON COULD BE OVERTURNED BY EUROPEAN JUDGES RESCUERS HAVE SPENT ALL NIGHT SEARCHING FOR THREE WORKERS AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF PART OF A DISUSED POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE
AND DONALD TRUMP HAS WON ANOTHER VICTORY IN THE CONTEST TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY SUSAN RAE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOVE CHALLENGE THE PRIME MINISTER'S ASSERTION THAT HIS DEAL WITH THE E.U. LEADERS PAVING THE WAY FOR A REFERENDUM ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IS LEGALLY BINDING IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE DECLARING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN MY GOPHERS TOLD B.B.C. NEWS THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE COULD OVERTURN THE CHANGES BEFORE THEY ARE INCORPORATED INTO E.U. TREATIES AND HE ADDS WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE
HE ALSO SAYS PULLING OUT OF THE E.U. WILL BE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITAIN TO RECOVER ITS MOJO MY GOALS WERE SPEAKING TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR AT LAWRENCE BACK SO IT BEGINS NOT JUST RIVALS BUT POLITICAL FRIENDS THE CLOSEST KIND MAKING STRONG BUT CONTRADICTORY CLAIMS IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
DAVID CAMERON HAS BOASTED THAT THE DEAL HE SECURED IN BRUSSELS WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS IS LEGALLY BINDING AND CANNOT BE REVERSED HE BELIEVES THE PROMISES IN THE DEAL HAVE LEGAL FORCE AND THAT THEY WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO E.U. LAW AS PART OF TREATY AGREEMENT IN THE FUTURE
BUT IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE MAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGLISH LEGAL SYSTEM MICHAEL GO SUGGESTS THAT EUROPEAN JUDGES COULD THROW OUT THE CHANGES THAT MISTER CAMERON FOUGHT SO HARD TO ACHIEVE AND HE URGES PHOTOS TO REALISE THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT STILL STANDS ABOVE EVERY NATION STATE NOTHING HE BELIEVES IN THE DEAL WILL CHANGE THAT
THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE INTERPRETS THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATIES AND UNTIL THIS AGREEMENT IS EMBODIED IN TREATY CHANGE THEN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS NOT BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT
GIVEN HIS ROLE AND HIS CLOSENESS TO THE PRIME MINISTER MY GHOST COMMENTS HAVE CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS FRAUGHT CAMPAIGN
IN THE PAST HALF AN HOUR OF NUMBER TEN HAS ISSUED THIS STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO MY GOATS REMARKS IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THIS DEAL IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING BRITAIN'S NEW SETTLEMENT IN THE E.U. HAS LEGAL FORCE AND IS AN IRREVERSIBLE INTERNATIONAL LAW DECISION THAT REQUIRES THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT

THE LETTER WHICH WAS RELEASED BY DOWNING STREET MAKES VERY SIMILAR ARGUMENTS ALREADY PUT FORWARD BY DAVID CAMERON AS TO WHY BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE DEFENCE CHIEFS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NATO'S THE CORNERSTONE OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY THEY ARGUE THE E.U. HAS ALSO BECOME AN IMPORTANT PILLAR HELPING GIVE A UNITED RESPONSE TO THREATS RANGING FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE TO A RESURGENT RUSSIA
LIKE DAVID CAMERON THEY CONCLUDE THAT BRITAIN WILL BE SAFER INSIDE THE E.U. THAN OUT A CLAIM THAT'S BEEN HOTLY DISPUTED BY THE OTHER SIDE AND NOT EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY WILL NECESSARILY SHARE THEIR VIEWS AT LEAST TO DEFENCE MINISTERS PENNY MORDANT AND JULIAN BRAZIER ARE BACKING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
RESCUE TEAMS HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT SEARCHING FOR US THREE WORKERS WHO ARE MISSING AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF PART OF THE FORMER DIDCOT POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE ONE PERSON DIED FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL MARC ASHDOWN REPORTS

B.B.C. NEWS UNDERSTANDS THAT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT USED ON VERIFY DATA TO BACK HIS ARGUMENTS FOR A SEVEN DAY N. H. S. THE FIGURES RELATING TO WEEKEND DEATH RATES WERE MENTIONED IN A SPEECH LAST SUMMER LABOUR HAS CALLED FOR AN INQUIRY THE DETAILS FROM OUR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM
IN JULY LAST YEAR JEREMY HUNT SET OUT PLANS TO BOOST WEEKEND SERVICES IN HOSPITALS HE SAID THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND EXCESS DEATHS AMONGST THOSE ADMITTED ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY COMPARED TO MIDWEEK BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH COULDN'T CONFIRM WHERE THE FIGURE CAME FROM EMAIL SEEN BY THE B. B. C. AFTER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS REVEAL CONFUSION FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTERWARDS AN N.H.S. ENGLAND OFFICIALS SAID THEY ATTEMPTED TO OFFER UP THE MOST BLAND STATEMENT POSSIBLE THAT WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR CONTRADICT MY STATEMENT
THE U.K. STATISTICS AUTHORITY WROTE TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION SO USERS COULD UNDERSTAND THE SOURCE OFFICIALS LATER SAID THE SIX THOUSAND FIGURE HAD BEEN DERIVED FROM A PREVIOUS STUDY OF THE SO CALLED WEEKEND AFFECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAID THE FIGURE WAS N.H.S. ENGLAND ANALYSIS AND A LATER STUDY SHOWED THERE WERE ELEVEN THOUSAND EXCESS DEATHS AMONGST THOSE ADMITTED BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY
NORTH WALES POLICE HAVE DEFENDED THE DECISION TO RUN OVER AND KILL A STRAY DOG THAT WAS ROAMING LOOSE ON A DUAL CARRIAGEWAY IN CONWAY SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CATCH THE FOX HOUND ON THE A. FIFTY FIVE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF MONDAY ONE OFFICER WAS BITTEN CARS AND LORRIES WERE SWERVING TO AVOID THE DOG IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE ONLY SAFE AND QUICK OPTION TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT WAS TO RUN IT OVER THE FOUR SAID BOTH OFFICERS INVOLVED ARE DOG OWNERS AND DIDN'T TAKE THE DECISION LIGHTLY
TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN SPECIALIST TEAMS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT FOR THREE PEOPLE MISSING AFTER PART OF A BUILDING COLLAPSED AT DIDCOT POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE ONE PERSON HAS DIED AND SEVERAL OTHERS HAD BEEN INJURED IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND EMERGENCY SERVICES CALLED IT A VERY SEVERE INCIDENT
THE PLANT CLOSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND DEMOLITION WORK HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE EVER SINCE BUT THIS COLLAPSE WAS NOT PLANNED IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO SIFT THROUGH THE HIGH PILES OF RUBBLE AND THE LOCAL FIRE SERVICE SAID IT COULD BE DAYS SEEM A GOOD TEXTURE REPORTS THANK YOU COME ON BOY YOU WANT DOGS NO NOT AT ALL
JUST AFTER FOUR P.M. ON A TUESDAY IN DIDCOT THIS HAPPENED SO I HAD TO FIND OUT ANYWAY JUST RECORDING THE DOGS COS THEY WERE FRONT RUNNER PARKS IT CRAZY BLAINE SMITH WAS WALKING HIS DOGS CLOSE TO THE POWER STATION WHEN HE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION OR BUILDING HAD COME CRASHING DOWN STARTED TO RECORD THE OBVIOUSLY THE BUILDING COLLAPSING AND CAN HEAR THE KID SCREAMING IN THE STREET
AND THEN ALL THE RUMBLE IN THE BACKGROUND IS OBVIOUSLY THE MALE JUST ACTUALLY LIKE GETTING IN LIKE THE WHOLE BUILDING AND PLAYED AND ON TOP OF ITSELF THOSE UP AN AEROPLANE WAS COMING UP BEHIND YOU IT WAS LIKE YOU NEEDED TO TURN ROUND SEE WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT BEHIND YOU NOT THE STUFF SO THE DOG STOP STILL I STOP STILL WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECONDS YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE BUILDING BECAUSE THE DUST ROSE SO HIGH
UP TO FIFTY PEOPLE WERE TREATED FOR DUST INHALATION AT THE SCENE AFTER THE DUST AND SMOKE HAD SETTLED A PILE OF DEBRIS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEET DEEP WAS UNCOVERED
THOSE WHO LIVE NEARBY TOLD US A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF A TEN STOREY BUILDING HAD COLLAPSED
DOMINIC END AS A RESIDENTIAL ROAD NOT FAR FROM THE POWER STATION
ALL THE HOUSES HERE FACE THE POWER PLANTS AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEM
EITHER HEARD OR SAW THE BUILDING COME CRASHING
THERE'S A FEW NEIGHBOURS ON THE KIDS' KIND OF NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON COS THERE'S A LOT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BUT WE CAME IN AFTER A WHILE COS IT'S DOWN TO GET A BIT TOO MUCH I THINK
MELANIE MCCARTNEY WAS UP THE BACK OF THEIR HOUSE WHEN THE BUILDING COLLAPSED LIKE MANY HERE SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT
SAD POOR FAMILIES ROUND HERE I EXPECT WHEREVER THEY'RE FROM WAITING TO FIND OUT
I'M ON THE ROAD AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE POWER PLANT
IT'S BEEN CORDONED OFF BY POLICE
WE CAN REALLY SEE IN THE DARKNESS IS A TALL TOWER WITH RED LIGHTS ON IT
A WAREHOUSE IN FRONT OF IT AND SOME TREES AND RAILINGS IN THE DISTANCE
IT IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT THE EXTENT OF THE COLLAPSE AND ALSO THE SCALE OF IT IS LODGE NATHAN TRAVIS IS THE DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE OFFICER FOR OXFORDSHIRE FIRE AND RESCUE SERVICE IT'S NOW REALLY KEEN THAT WE GET THE SNIFFER DOGS ON AND WE GOT SPECIALIST IN AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO A DETERMINED SEARCH
DIDCOT A POWER STATION HAS BEEN CLOSED SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN SO SOME BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DEMOLISHED BUT THIS BUILDING COLLAPSE WAS UNEXPECTED AND SOME HEARSAY IT'S CAUSED SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE SITE
AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT WENT WRONG HAS BEEN LAUNCHED SI MACA TOUCHER REPORTING FROM DIDCOT THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S THE GOODNESS OF MILK SUGAR AND GLUCOSE AND BIG CHOCOLATE IN THE MARS THAT HELPS YOU WORK REST
UNFORTUNATELY FOR MARS ALL OF THAT MAY NOW COME WITH A BIT OF PLASTIC AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT A MAN IN GERMANY FOUND IN HIS SNICKERS BAR IT'S SPARKED A MASS RECALL OF MARS CHOCOLATE IN FIFTY FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE U.K. IT IS FUN SIZE MARS AND MILKY BARS THAT ARE AFFECTED AS OUR BOXES OF CELEBRATIONS HOW HIS MA'S GOING TO HANDLE THIS WE'RE JOINED FROM GUILDFORD BY VINCE SHIES MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY A Q. A. GROUP GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO COST THEM
WELL IT'S EARLY DAYS AT THE MOMENT PRODUCT RECALLS AN EXPENSIVE ACTIVITY SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT INVOLVES MANY PRODUCTS AND MANY COUNTRIES CAN TYPICALLY COST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS EVEN MILLIONS BUT IT IS A COST THAT IS WORTH TAKING TO WHAT IS TO WARD OFF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS PLASTIC IN OTHER LEADS TO LAWSUITS I'M SURE THAT THE WAY THAT MILES OR ANY COMPANY OF THIS TYPE WOULD ACT IN THE SNAKE IN THIS ISSUE
IS IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMER SAFETY AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN THIS CLEARLY IS A RISK OF A RIPPLE OF A REPORT OF A CONTAMINATION IN ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AT LEAST AND MARS HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO AND IT'S A VERY BIG DECISION TO INITIATE A PRODUCT RECALL ACROSS FIFTY FIVE COUNTRIES I THINK THEY SAY THEY'RE TAKING THAT ACTION OUT OF PRECAUTION
AND I MEAN OUR ADVICE TO COMPANIES IS ALWAYS MAKE YOUR DECISIONS IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMER SAFETY AND I THINK THAT THIS APPEARS TO BE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO RECALL ALL PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED AT ONE PARTICULAR PLOT IS IS THAT WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE ADVISED THEM TO DRAW THE LINE BECAUSE IT'S GONE ACROSS A LOT OF PRODUCT RANGES
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THERE IS A CONTAMINATION AND HAS IT STARTED ON OUR PARTICULAR PRODUCTION LINE
NOW THE TYPICAL APPROACH WOULD BE TO INVESTIGATE WHERE THE CONTAMINATIONS COME FROM IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY WHERE THAT PLASTIC ORIGINATED MAYBE IT WAS FROM A PIECE OF PLASTIC ON THE PRODUCTION LINE MAYBE THERE'S LITTLE BITS OF IT COMING OFF DURING PRODUCTION THEN YOU NEED TO WORK OUT AT WHAT STAGE DID WE LAST KNOWN THAT THAT PIECE OF PLASTIC ON THE PRODUCTION LINE WAS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IN PLACE
AND THEN ANYTHING THAT'S GONE THROUGH THAT LINE SINCE THAT DATE OR TIME COULD IN THEORY BE AFFECTED ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THE RISK IS VERY LOW AND SO THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE AND WHAT WOULD BE TYPICAL THAT THE THE RECALL IS VERY MUCH RESTRICTED TO THAT FACTORY AND I THINK EVEN TO THAT PRODUCTION LINE AND IN YOUR EXPERIENCE TO DO THESE SORTS OF THINGS A BLOW OVER FAIRLY QUICKLY OR IT'S ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THIS THIS IS A VERY BIG CASE AND GETTING INTO THE PRESS AND ON THE NEWS SOCIAL MEDIA EVERYTHING ACTUALLY IN A WAY WHILST I'M SURE THE NEWSPAPER HEADLINES THIS MORNING AREN'T GREAT COMFORT FROM MARS IT DOES MEAN THAT THE MESSAGE GETS ACROSS TO CONSUME VERY RAPIDLY WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE CHALLENGING FOR MANUFACTURERS TO GET THEIR MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS
AND I THINK AS I SAID BEFORE IF YOU ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMER SAFETY I THINK CONSUMERS OUT THERE WILL SEE THAT MARS ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND ACTING ACCORDINGLY AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS WILL NECESSARILY BE IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WEEKS MONTHS BEYOND THIS MILES GOD IS THE MOST POPULAR HEADLINERS THAT'S RIDICULOUS STORY THEN SARGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT JUNIOR DOCTORS TO GET THEM WORKING MORE WEEKENDS IS BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WILL BE BETTER FOR PATIENTS HERE'S THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT
WHEN YOU TURN MEDICINE INTO MONDAY TO FRIDAY PROFESSION YOU END UP WITH CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS AND IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE THEN GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE CONTRACT TO GIVE CONSULTANTS THEIR RIGHT TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY WORK AT WEEKENDS AND THE RESULT IS THAT NOW IF YOU ARE ADMITTED ON A SUNDAY YOU ARE FIFTEEN PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO DIE THAN IF YOU ADMITTED ON A WEDNESDAY WE HAVE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND AVOIDABLE DEATHS EVERY YEAR
WHEN THE HEALTH SECRETARY WAS CHALLENGED ON WHERE THAT FIGURE CAME FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND WERE NOT ENTIRELY FORTHCOMING ACCORDING TO A STRING OF EMAILS NOW SEEN BY THE B. B. C. THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR RESEARCH INTO WEEKEND DEATHS THAT HE WAS QUOTING HAD NOT BEEN PUBLISHED
OR PEER REVIEWED OUR HEALTH EDITOR HUGH BENT PYM JOINS US ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING
WE SHOULD COME ON WE SHOULD PROBABLY STOP I THINK IT WAS ULTIMATELY PUBLISHED IN FACT WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE ARE MORE DEATHS AT WEEKENDS
YES THIS ISSUE OF EXCESS DEATHS AMONGST PEOPLE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AT WEEKEND DEATHS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS HAS BECOME REALLY CENTRAL TO A LOT OF THE DEBATE AROUND THE SEVEN DAY N.H.S. DURING THE DISPUTE WITH THE JUNIOR DOCTORS SO THE FIGURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT HERE AND YES THE FIGURE OF SIX THOUSAND THAT YOU HEARD THERE FROM JEREMY HUNT LAST JULY
IT WAS SAID THEN ACTUALLY AN ACADEMIC STUDY THAT I'VE BEEN PEER REVIEWED WAS PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER WHICH CAME UP WITH A FIGURE OF ELEVEN THOUSAND EXCESS DEATHS BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY COMPARED TO MID WEEK BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS THAT SPEECH WAS QUITE A BIG WIDE RANGING SPEECH WILL SECRETARY OF STATE SETTING OUT HIS PLANS TO BOOST WEEKEND SERVICES AND THE SIX THOUSAND FIGURE HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD AT THAT POINT
WHEN JOURNALISTS CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT DAY INCLUDING SOME IN THE B. B. C. THEY WERE UNABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY JUSTIFICATION AT THE TIME FOR THE FIGURE AND IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE ANYTHING WAS SAID MORE IN PUBLIC BUT EMAIL SEEN BY THE B.B.C. FROM FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS
REVEAL A LOT OF CONFUSION IN WHITEHALL ON THE U.K. STATISTICS AUTHORITY GOT IN TOUCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REMINDING THEM THAT FIGURES USED BY MINISTERS SHOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EQUALLY TO ALL USERS AND EMAIL
SEEN BY ONE OFFICIAL TO ANOTHER SAID WE WERE CHALLENGED TO SITE THE SOURCE OF THE SIX THOUSAND FIGURE AND ATTEMPTED TO OFFER UP THE MOST BLAND STATEMENT POSSIBLE THAT WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR CONTRADICT THE STATEMENT WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE
EMERGED IS THAT ACTUALLY JEREMY HUNT DID GET THIS FIGURE FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND FROM SICK BRUCE CAIO THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR SO HE CONSIDERED THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SOUND FIGURE TO USE BUT IT DID TAKE A LITTLE WHILE FOR ANY CONFIRMATION OF WHERE THIS CAME FROM AND THEN IN THE END THE FIGURE PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER WAS ITS ELEVEN THOUSAND FIGURE WHICH ITSELF HAS PROVED CONTROVERSIAL SO THAT BASICALLY THEY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT AT THAT STAGE
WELL THERE WERE SUSPICIONS THAT SOMEHOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAD GOT HOLD OF AN ADVANCED SIGHTING OF THIS PIECE OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH THAT WAS ONGOING WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN PEER REVIEWED AT THAT POINT THE AUTHORS HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR THEY DIDN'T HAND OVER OFFICIALLY ANY OF THEIR
FINDINGS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF SOME OF THE FINDINGS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT AT HIGH LEVELS OF THE N.H.S. AND N.H.S. ENGLAND HAVE CONFIRMED SIR BRUCE WAS TALKING TO OFFICIALS AT THE TWO ARMS OF HEALTH ABOUT SOME OF THE HEADLINE FINDINGS AND THAT THESE WERE TAKEN ON BOARD BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE IT'S JUST THAT AT THAT TIME OFFICIALS WERE
UNABLE TO TELL US EXACTLY WHERE IT HAD COME FROM AND IT DOES RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT THERE WHY WHITEHALL OPERATES THE USE OF STATISTICS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT THE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIGURE FOR EXCESS DEATHS WAS HIGHER THAN THE SIX THOUSAND AND IT WAS PUBLISHED AND WAS PUT OUT THERE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER I DO SAY WE'RE AT THE END OF IT ALL THERE IS A WEEKEND EFFECT WE'RE JUST NOT SURE WHY AND WHETHER CHANGING CONTACTS MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO IT
YES I THINK THIS IS THE KEY POINT OF THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY SAID THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST IN THEIR VIEW ANY EVIDENCE LINKING IT TO STAFFING THEY'RE NOT RULING OUT STAFFING LEVELS AT THE GOVERNMENT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY THINK MORE DOCTORS OTHER STAFF ARE NEEDED MORE AT WEEKENDS THAT THE WEEKEND EFFECT IS A SERIOUS EFFECT FOR THE N.H.S. TO ADDRESS SO IT REMAINS AN ONGOING AND PRETTY SENSITIVE ISSUE IN THIS DISPUTE
THANKS VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY PAST SEVEN HOW WAS THE POUND DOING AFTER A SHOP DROP THAT SAW IT HIT A SEVEN YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR SIMON'S HERE TO TELL US MORE BUT THEY KEPT FALLING YOU NOW GET LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR FORTY CENTS FOR A POUND IT HASN'T BEEN THIS LOW SINCE THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND LINE HOW COME WELL HERE'S GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE JUST YESTERDAY WE'VE SEEN A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR IN THE F.X. MARKETS PARTICULARLY AFFECTS ARCHIE'S
THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE PURCHASE OF DOWNSIDE PROTECTION AGAINST FURTHER FALLS IN THE CURRENCY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF REFERENDA
PRIMULAS ARE COMING TO SCHOOL WILL DEANNE JULIUS IS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE AND COUNTY CHAIRMAN IF YOU SELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU I THOUGHT OFTEN THINK OF THE CURRENCY LIKE THE SHARE PRICE OF A COUNTRY AND OURS IS FALLING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE ANALOGY IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S AWAY WAY THE MARKETS CAN BELT OR INDICATE WHAT THEIR VIEW IS FOR OF THE CURRENT SITUATION BUT I DON'T THINK ONE SHOULD OVERPLAY A TIME AND I THINK THAT MISTER CARNE SAID IS RIGHT THAT PEOPLE WILL BE TAKING OUT DOWNSIDE PROTECTION BECAUSE THE GENERAL
THE VIEW IS THAT NOW THE REFERENDUM IS ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED STERLING IS GOING TO SEE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND PROBABLY DOWN TIGHT PRESSURE OH CASE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION LIKE AN INSURANCE POLICY IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT VERY PLEASANT USUALLY HAPPENS INSURANCE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CURRENCY IN HER BREAKS IT'S AN
WELL NOBODY KNOWS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY THAT ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHICH THE WITH THE REFERENDUM WILL EITHER COME OUT WITH A YESSIR AND A LEVER OR STAY AYE AND IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO THAT
TO HAVE A ONE WAY BET SO YOU TURNED THAT ONE DIRECTION AND TAKE OUT SOME PROTECTION IN CASE YOU'RE WRONG MARK KONY ALSO TOLD THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE YESTERDAY HE HAD A CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR THAT HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE BUT WHAT SORT OF THING WHAT MIGHT THAT INCLUDE IF YOU WANTED TO PUT A BIT OF PADDING ROUND YOURSELF WHAT WOULD HELP FORM WITH THAT
WELL IN CASE OF A CENTRAL BANK OF THE THE USUAL OBJECTIVE IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THE MARKETS REMAIN OPEN THAT IS THAT WE DON'T GET A FREEZER AT MARKETS AS WE HAD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOR A COMPLETELY OTHER ISN'T SO WHAT HE'LL BE DOING I SUSPECT HE'S JUST REASSURING BANKS LARGE CUSTOMERS THAT LIQUIDITY WILL BE FREELY PROVIDED SHOULD THERE BE A REAL DISRUPTION AT THE TIME THAT THE REFERENDUM RESULT IS ANNOUNCED AND OF COURSE COULD RETURN TO THE CURRENCY OR CHEAP APPARENT HIS NAME IT'S NOT ALL BAD AT ALL
WELL EXACTLY LIKE MOST ECONOMIC VARIABLES SOME SOME BENEFITS SOME SUFFER SO IT WOULD BE CERTAINLY GOOD FOR EXPORTERS ARE GOOD FOR THOSE COMPANIES IN BRITAIN WHO HAVE BIG OVERSEAS EARNINGS THAT THEY WILL BE BOOSTED AND IN THAT SENSE PROBABLY GOOD FOR THE EXCHEQUER OH KAY THE ANGELUS INFORM THEM THEN P.C. MANY THANKS INDEED

THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOVE SAYS DAVID CAMERON'S DEAL ON NEW TERMS FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. COULD BE CHALLENGED AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE IT HASN'T YET BEEN WRITTEN INTO AN E.U. TREATY IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE DECIDING TO CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE MY GOLF HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE COURT WASN'T BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT UNTIL TREATIES HAVE CHANGED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE
DOWNING STREET HAS REJECTED MY INTERPRETATION IT SAID THE DEAL HAD LEGAL FORCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH REQUIRED THE EUROPEAN COURT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
THIRTEEN OF THE U.K.'S MOST SENIOR FORMER MILITARY FIGURES HAVE SIGNED A LETTER ARGUING THAT BRITAIN IS SAFER IN THE U. AND BETTER ABLE TO MEET GLOBAL THREATS AT LEAST TO DEFENCE MINISTERS ARE BACKING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
A SEARCH OPERATION IS CONTINUING TO FIND THREE PEOPLE MISSING AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF HALF OF A DEFUNCT POWER STATION AT DIDCOT IN OXFORDSHIRE ONE PERSON DIED FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL
THE U.S. BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP HAS SCORED A THIRD CONSECUTIVE VICTORY IN THE RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PARTIAL RESULTS SUGGEST HE WON MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN A NEVADA CARCASSES

ASTON MARTIN HAS SELECTED A SITE IN WALES FOR ITS NEW CAR PLANT SAINT ATHENS IN THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN BEAT COMPETITION FROM TWENTY LOCATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD THE FACTORY WILL CREATE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY JOBS ITSELF AND A FURTHER THOUSAND JOBS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOCAL BUSINESSES
IT'S NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED THE DEAL HE STRUCK IN BRUSSELS LAST WEEK WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER IT LEADERS AS LEGALLY BINDING AND IRREVERSIBLE BUT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO SAYS THE REFORMS ARE NOT AND THEY COULD BE OVERTURNED BY EUROPEAN JUDGES
HE SPOKE TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KEARNS BERGEN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ANNOUNCING THAT HE WOULD CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. LAURA JOINS US AND LAURA HIS FIRST COMMENTS APPEAR TO BE WHAT A DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S
WELL LEN DID SARAH MICHAEL GOES COMMENTS HAVE PARTICULAR FORCE BECAUSE HE'S CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BIGGEST BRAINS IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND HE'S ALSO A MODERNISER LIKE DAVID CAMERON SOME WHO'S BEEN CLOSE TO HIM THROUGHOUT HIS POLITICAL JOURNEY
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S ALSO THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND IN RECENT DAYS DOWNING STREET HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID THE DEAL THEY'VE ACHIEVED IS LEGALLY BINDING THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT ON LOTS OF OCCASIONS SOME OF THEIR CRITICS HAVE SAID THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO I ASKED MICHAEL GO FOR YOU KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT THIS IF THE DEAL WAS SAFE FROM BEING CHALLENGED BY JUDGES AT THE EUROPEAN COURT
THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE INTERPRETS THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATIES AND UNTIL THIS AGREEMENT IS EMBODIED IN TREATY CHANGE THEN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS NOT BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT
SO HE'S THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM YOU WERE SAYING CLEARLY WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS GOT FROM BRUSSELS RIGHT NOW COULD BE CHUCKED OUT BY EUROPEAN JUDGES ULTIMATELY IT IS A MATTER OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW AND BRITISH
BUT ONLY TREATIES HAVE AFFECT AND THAT BECAUSE THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED I'M NOT YET
TREATY CHANGES THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE COULD TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT HERE BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLAIM IS WHAT HE GOT IN BRUSSELS IS IRREVOCABLE YOU'RE SAYING IT COULD EASILY BE AN UNDONE BY THE EUROPEAN COURTS I THINK THAT THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH ARE TRUE
THE FIRST THING IS THE PROMISE IS RIGHT THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS AND THOSE NATIONS HAVE ALL AGREED THAT THEY WILL ABIDE BY IT
ABOVE THOSE NATIONS IT'S THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND INDEED SAID TO BE COMPLETELY CLEAR YOU'RE A VERY CONVINCED
THAT THIS COULD BE CHUCKED OUT BY EUROPEAN JUDGES WHO OVER WHOM AS YOU SAY WE HAVE NO CONTROL I CAN ONLY STATE WHAT THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS ARE THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS NOT BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT UNTIL
TREATIES ARE CHANGED AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE THE DAVID CAMERON'S ASSERTION THIS IS IRREVOCABLE THIS IS A DONE DEAL THIS WILL DEFINITELY HAPPEN THAT'S WRONG NO YOU'RE TRYING DELIBERATELY UNDERSTANDABLY TO GET ME TO CRITICISE
THE PRIME HE WAS THE PROMISE WAS VERY PRECISE ALASKAN RUGS WAS VERY PRECISE AND STACEY AND I THINK THAT THIS WAS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BUT I'M ASKING YOU TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION IS THE PRIME MINISTER'S CAMPAIGN HERE IS TO SAY TO THE BRITISH POPULATION THAT THE CHANGES HE IS SECURED IN BRUSSELS WILL DEFINITELY HAPPEN THAT HE HAS GOT THEM LEGALLY BOUND
THAT HIS COMMITMENTS ARE ESSENTIALLY CAST IRON GUARANTEES AND YOU'RE SAYING ON YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT IS NOT THE CASE
THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT UNTIL THE TREATIES CHANGE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS BOUND ONLY TO INTERPRET THE TREATIES AND THAT MEANS THAT DAVID CAMERON IS SOMEHOW BEING THIS LEADER I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU TO QUINTO I DID YOU IF YOU COLLEAGUE NO I DON'T THINK YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE
HE'S TELLING PEOPLE SOMETHING ELSE HE'S TELLING PEOPLE THIS IS A DONE DEAL BUT THIS IS LEGALLY GOING TO HAPPEN THAT IS THE CENTRAL POINT OF HIS CAMPAIGN
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS A. A DEAL BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS ALL OF THEM BELIEVE IT
BUT THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS THAT IT STANDS ABOVE THE NATION STATES SO THE PROMISE IS RIGHT
THIS IS A DEAL THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT NATION STAND BEHIND I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S BEEN MISLEADING ANYONE BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PEOPLE ALSO RECOGNISE THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE STANDS ABOVE EVERY NATION STATE AND ULTIMATELY
IT WILL DECIDE ON THE BASIS OF THE TREATIES AND THIS DEAL WAS NOT YET IN THE TREATIES HOW DO YOU WANT THIS COUNTRY TO BE DIFFERENT I MEAN THIS IS PART OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION HERE ISN'T IT WHAT WOULD CHANGE IF WE LEFT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS
OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITAIN TO RECOVER ITS MAJOR
FOR BRITAIN TO BE A MORE FLEXIBLE OUTWARD LOOKING CREATIVE PLACE ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THAT IT'S HELD US
A SHARE OF TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS DIMINISHED DURING THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THE E.U. AND THE
THE NATURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S BUREAUCRACY THE FAILURE OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE PROBLEMS THAT HE'S HAD WITH MIGRATION
ALL OF THEM POINT TO THE FACT THAT IT IS AN OLD FASHIONED MODEL IT SCLEROTIC IT'S OUT OF DATE
BRITAIN COULD BE A LEAD IN SHAPING THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
WHAT ABOUT LAURA ON THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER THE DEAL COULD BE OVERTURNED WE DO KNOW THAT AT SOME STAGE IT WILL BE OR AT LEAST ELEMENTS OF IT WILL BE PUT INTO THE E.U. TREATIES IS IT JUST A QUESTION OF WHAT CAN BE UNDONE BEFORE
DOWNING STREET'S BEEN VERY ROBUST THIS MORNING ABOUT THIS TO GO TO COMMENT SAYING IT'S NOT TRUE THE DEAL THEY'VE GOT HAS GOT LEGAL FORCE BEFORE A NEW TREATY COMES INTO FORCE THEY'VE SAID THAT THE E.U. COURT WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT BUT THEY'VE BEEN QUITE CAREFUL WITH THEIR LANGUAGE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING INTO ACCOUNT IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING LEGALLY BOUND BY SOMETHING AND OF COURSE IT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE DAVID CAMERON STARTED OUT WANTING FULL ON TREATY CHANGE AS HE DESCRIBED IT THAT AMBITION WAS SCALED BACK AND IT'S NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS STAGE TO SAY
WHEN THE TREATIES MIGHT ACTUALLY BE CHANGED AND OF COURSE THE TREATY PROCESS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN TAKE YEARS IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE APPROVED BY EVERY COUNTRY SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR AT NUMBER TEN TO BE CATEGORICAL ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENING THEY SAY THEY'VE GOT A COMMITMENT IN GOOD FAITH AND ALL THE LEADERS ON A PIECE OF PAPER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THAT MUCH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND MICHAEL GO HE'S QUITE CAREFULLY TRYING NOT TO CRITICISE HIS FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE DIRECTLY BUT WHILE STILL VERY ROBUSTLY MAKING THIS POINT
BUT I THINK THIS DOES PLAY IN SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF DAVID CAMERON'S OPPONENTS ARE SAYING LOOK THIS DEAL IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT'S WRITTEN ON BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO A NEW TREATY DOWNING STREET ON THE OTHER SIDE I TRIED THEIR BEST TO SAY IT DOES HAVE LEGAL STATUS WHICH INDEED IT DOES BUT THEY CANNOT BE CATEGORIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN A ABOUT WHEN THE TREATY WILL ACTUALLY BE AGREED BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER WHOLE COMPLICATED NEGOTIATING PROCESS THERE MIGHT TAKE YEARS JUST LIKE THIS ONE
INDEED LAURA KINSBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL DOMINIC GRIEVE ABOUT THIS IN AN HOUR'S TIME AND ALSO IT'S GOING TO BE HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MARTIN SHORTS AT TEN PAST EIGHT THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS ARE RIGHT FARCES HOW THE SUN DESCRIBES A LETTER SIGNED BY BUSINESS LEADERS PLEADING TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PAPER SAYS IT COULDN'T CARE LESS THAT A FEW CORPORATE FAT CATS WANT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. IT SAYS THE LIST IS PEPPERED WITH TORY CRONIES DONORS AND FOREIGNERS
THOSE WHO SIGNED HER FACING A BACKLASH ACCORDING TO THE MAIL IT SAYS FIFTEEN OF THE COMPANY'S RECEIVED NINETY FOUR MILLION POUNDS IN GRANTS FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION A QUARTER HAD PREVIOUSLY CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.K. TO JOIN THE EURO THE DAILY MIRROR DESCRIBES DAVID CAMERON'S CAMPAIGN AS A SHAMBLES AND SAYS SEVEN OF HIS OWN BUSINESS ADVISERS SNUBBED HIS CALL TO PUBLICLY BACKED THE IN CAMPAIGN IT SAYS THE HEADS OF WHITBREAD LEGAL AND GENERAL AND PURSE MUM WERE AMONG THOSE WHO REFUSED TO SIGN
OLD SCHOOL TIES STILL MATTER FOR JUDGES DOCTORS AND ACTORS ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS BY THE SUDDEN TRUST THAT'S REPORTED IN A NUMBER OF PAPERS THE TELEGRAPH PICKS OUT THE TWO THIRDS OF THE U.K.'S OSCAR WINNING ACTORS WENT TO FEE PAYING SCHOOLS THE TIMES PUBLISHES A DOO DIAGRAM WHICH SHOWS TOP PERFORMERS IN MEDICINE LAW BUSINESS JOURNALISM THE CIVIL SERVICE AND THE MILITARY WENT TO INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS ONLY BRIT AWARD WINNERS BUCK THE TREND
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TRUST OF PETE AND AMPLE TELLS A GUARD IN THE KEY TO IMPROVING SOCIAL MOBILITY IS TO OPEN THESE SCHOOLS TO PUPILS BASED ON MERIT NOT MONEY THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION TELLS INDEPENDENT STATE SECTOR IS INCREASINGLY MATCHING THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC ATTAINMENT THE FINANCIAL TIMES LEADS AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE IS HOLDING MERGER TALKS WITH ITS GERMAN RIVAL DEUTSCHE BALSA
IN ITS LEX COLUMN THE PAPER NOTES THAT TWO PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO COMBINE THE TWO MARKETS HAVE FAILED PARTLY BECAUSE WHAT IT CALLS BRITISH HARRUMPHING OVER A NATIONAL INSTITUTION BEING SHIPPED ABROAD THE PAPER CONCLUDES THIS IS NO TIME FOR SENTIMENT AND URGES THOSE INVOLVED TO DO THE DEAL BUT NEIL'S PARTLY IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS IT'S A LONG WAY FROM BEING DONE ARGUING THAT THE L.S.E. MUST ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SELLING ITSELF TOO CHEAPLY AND WHETHER THE PROPOSED NEW PARTNERSHIP IS ANTI COMPETITIVE
THE MYSTERY OF THE BATTLE OF TEN SIXTY NINE HAS BEEN SOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL ACCORDING TO THE TIMES HE MAY NOT HAVE HEARD OF IT BUT WHAT THE INDEPENDENT DESCRIBED AS THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS REMATCH LOOKS SET TO CHANGE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ENGLISH HISTORY
THE BATTLE BETWEEN IT WAS BETWEEN THE SONS OF KING HAROLD HE OF COURSE DIED IN THAT BETTER KNOWN BATTLE IN TEN SIXTY SIX AND IT WAS BETWEEN THE SONS AND THE NORMANS IT WAS GRADUALLY FORGOTTEN BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT BUT FIVE YEARS OF RESEARCH BY NICK ARNOLD THE AUTHOR OF THE HORRIBLE SCIENCES BOOKS HAS LOCATED IT AND NORTH THEM ON THAT TOWEL ESTUARY IN NORTH DEVON AND THE QUEEN IS PICTURED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES THE EXPRESS AND THE TELEGRAPH SMILING BROADLY AS SHE FOLLOWED QUEEN VICTORIA IN HAVING A NEW RAIL LINE UNDER LONDON NAMED AFTER HER BEATRICE HOPES THAT
NOW IT IS CALLED ELIZABETH PEOPLE CAN PUT ALL THE CROSSNESS CAUSED BY THE SCHEME BEHIND THEM THE LINE WILL BE PURPLE ON MAPS AND IN WHAT THE TIME SCHOOLS NEAR PERFECT WARDROBE PLANNING HER MAJESTY'S OUTFIT MATCHED DESPITE HAVING ALLY NAMED AFTER HER THE QUEEN IS FAR FROM THE REGULAR UNDERGROUND TRAVELLER IN FACT THE LAST TIME SHE TRAVELLED ON THE TUBE WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SHE RODE IN THE DRIVER'S CAB AND THAT MOMENT WAS CAPTURED BY BRITISH PATSY THE QUEEN STAYED UP
THE NEW STATIONS WHICH VICTORIA COMPRISE THE WESTERN SECTION OF THE VICTORIA LINE AND THE COMPANY BY BEFORE THAT LONDON TRANSPORT THE QUEEN THEN MADE THE RETURN JOURNEY IN ONE OF THE BRIGHT MODERN COOKING HER MAJESTY INCIDENTALLY WAS THE FIRST REIGNING MONARCH EVER TO RIDE ON
SHE HAS HER OWN LIVELY ELIZABETH LINE THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS WHILE HAVING A FRY UP YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY WE SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS EVERY YEAR ON SAUSAGES BUT HOW HAS THE HUMBLE BRITISH BANGER BEEN CHANGED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT TEN EVERY DAY OBJECTS AND EXPLORE THE IMPACT OR OTHERWISE THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP HAS HAD ON THEM THE E.U. IN TEN OBJECTS IF YOU LIKE AND THE SAUSAGES FIRST UP HERE'S OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT OF MATTHEW PRICE
SIZZLING SAUSAGES HOW MUCH THOUGH HAS BROTHEL WE'VE GOT ITS HANDS ON THE BRITISH BANGER WELL LET'S START RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING
NO BUT ALL PIGS HAVE WRAPPED UP IN RED TAPE BRUSSELS CALLS IT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SLOWISH ONE TWENTY SLOWISH ISH SEE
IT COVERS ANIMAL WELFARE ACROSS THE E.U. BUT THE RED TAPE DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH FOR US WE'RE IN A NATION OF ANIMAL LOVERS WE'RE GOING TO DEMAND HIGH WELFARE STANDARDS ON EUROPE IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER THAT'S A PIG FARMER FERGUS HOWIE FROM WICKES MANOR IN ESSEX AND HE'S RIGHT WE HAVE HIGHER ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS THAN THE REST OF THE E.U. WHEN IT COMES TO PIG HAPPINESS WE WRAP OURSELVES UP IN MORE RED TAPE SOME BRUSSELS REQUIRES WE'VE HAD DUTCH
SPANISH FARMERS COME AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE WAY WE FIND PETEY IF YOU WERE MAD AT THE EUROPEAN METHOD OF FARMING IS TO HOUSE YOU PIGS INSIDE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT SO THE PIG HAS MAXIMUM GROWTH RATES IT'S A VERY
PROFITABLE WAY OF FARMING VERY CHEAP WAY OF FARMING BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO IMPORT PORK INTO THIS COUNTRY FAR BELOW THE COST THAT WE CAN PRODUCE FOR YEARS BRITISH MINISTERS HAVE PUSHED IN BRUSSELS FOR TIGHTER EACH ANIMAL WELFARE RULES THEY'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS
STILL COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN E.U. COUNTRIES OUR PIGS ARE HAPPY
MOSTLY A PORK IS BETTER QUALITY AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE
MOST PEOPLE PREFER TO BUY CHEAPER SAUSAGES CHEAPER CONTINENTAL IMPORTS
DENMARK HOLLAND GERMANY POLAND AND SPAIN MAKE UP SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PORK WE CONSUME
GOOD FOR YOU THE SHOPPER BAD FOR THE BRITISH PIG FARMER WHOSE PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET
IT'S MADE WORSE FOR THEM BECAUSE SOME E.U. COUNTRIES DON'T ENFORCE THE WELFARE RULES THAT DO EXIST
BRITISH PRICES IS DROPPING HAD BEEN FORCED DOWN BY CHEAP EUROPEAN IMPORTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED ILLEGALLY TO STANDARDS IN THIS COUNTRY IF I PRODUCE FOR TODAY'S STANDARDS I'LL BE LOCKED UP YOU'D SEE ME DRIVEN UP THE ROAD IN TANKER ON THE OTHER HAND EVEN IF WE LEFT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SELF SUFFICIENT IN PORK WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO IMPORT THE MEAT AND IT STILL WOULDN'T BE UP TO BRITISH STANDARDS
SMELLING GOOD NOW THE E.U. DOESN'T STIPULATE WHAT A SAUSAGE IS SO WE CAN MAKE THEM HOWEVER WE LIKE BROTHELS DOES THOUGH PROTECT SPECIFIC TYPES LIKE CUMBERLAND SAUSAGE
A MACHINE MAKING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SAUSAGES A MINUTE THE ADDITIVES AND E. NUMBERS THEY CONTAIN A CONTROLLED SOLELY
CREATED BY OUR MINISTERS AND OTHERS IN BRUSSELS E.U. RULES ALSO STIPULATE THE ORIGIN OF THE PORK MUST BE LABEL
BUT ONLY THE CARCASS NOT THE PROCESSED MEAT A BRITISH FIRM CAN IMPORT PORK FROM SPAIN PUBLIC THROUGH THE GRINDER AND CALL IT A BRITISH SAUSAGE
HOW DO WE KNOW THE MEAT IS SAFE AND WIDE BIG HEALTH CERTIFICATE SOMETIMES IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IF ONE COUNTRY ON EUROPEAN UNION GOES DOWN WITH A DISEASE THAT PREVENTS ALL OF
NOT ALWAYS THAT'S THE NATIONAL PIG ASSOCIATIONS DOCTOR GEORGINA CRAYFORD TWO YEARS AGO POLAND AND THE BALTIC STATES WENT DOWN WITH AFRICAN SWINE FEVER
RUSSIA CLOSE ITS BORDERS TO EUROPEAN PYGMY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S POSITION IS THAT IT WOULD LIKE ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS TO BE ON THIS EASY WIDE SCALE ALL OR NOTHING BUT MOST COUNTRIES SAY IF ONE NATION GETS A DISEASE IT WON'T STOP THEM IMPORTING FROM THE REST OF THE E.U. AND WITH OTHER PLACES LIKE THE GROWING FAR EAST MARKET WE HAVE BILATERAL DEALS THAT DON'T INVOLVE E.U. CERTIFICATION
SO FINALLY I GET TO HAVE THAT BREAKFAST
AND I CAN CONFIRM IT IS STILL A BRITISH BANGER MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING ON ONE OF OUR TEN OBJECTS ANOTHER THE MOBILE PHONE WILL BE LOOKING AT LATER THIS WEEK IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER WITH US HERE IN LONDON THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL IN OXFORD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING MICHELLE YESTERDAY M.P.S DEBATED HOW TO MEASURE THE LIFE CHANCES OF CHILDREN AND THE FACTORS THAT HOLD THEM BACK
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MEASURE FAMILY INCOME PREFERRING TO RECORD FACTORS SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD UNEMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT THEIR CRITICS ARGUED THAT FAMILY INCOME IS SUCH A KEY INDICATOR THAT IT CAN'T BE IGNORED NO HOUSEHOLD INCOME THEY SAY REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF POVERTY AMONG CHILDREN AND TO LOSE SIGHT OF THIS WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP
WHATEVER THE CAUSES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE OF CHILDREN IT'S POSSIBLE TO HEAR IN THIS ARGUMENT ECHOES OF AN OLD THEOLOGICAL DEBATE ABOUT HUMAN DESTINY AND ABOUT HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE WERE IN CHARGE OF OUR OWN DESTINY
THE PROTESTANT REFORMERS REJECTED THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD EARN YOUR OWN SALVATION BY GOOD WORKS THEY PREACH THAT SALVATION COMES FROM GOD ALONE AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO SAVE OURSELVES SOME WENT SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT I SIMPLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING MAN COULD GET IN THE WAY OF GOD'S FREE GRACE
AT THE EXTREME OF THIS ARGUMENT WAS THE HORRIBLE IDEA THAT SINCE GOD CHOOSES TO SAVE SOME THROUGH NO MERIT OF THEIR OWN HE MUST CHOOSE TO DAMN OTHERS THROUGH NO SPECIAL FAULT OF THEIR OWN THIS GRIM AND DOCTRINE LED MANY PEOPLE TO BE CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE DESTINED FOR HELL AND THEY LIVED A WRETCHED LIFE BECAUSE OF IT
THIS MAY SEEM A LONG WAY FROM YESTERDAY'S DEBATE BUT TRANSLATE PREDESTINATION INTO SECULAR TERMS DO YOU MAKE AT THE IDEA THAT IF YOU GROW UP IN A POOR HOUSEHOLD YOUR PRE DESTINED TO HAVE A POORER LIFE YOU CAN EXPECT TO DO LESS WELL AT SCHOOL TO HAVE WORSE HEALTH AND TO DIE EARLIER AND THEN IF YOU EXTEND THE ANALOGY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IT REQUIRES STATE INTERVENTION TO REDUCE INCOME INEQUALITY AND SO INCREASE YOUR LIFE CHANCES
THE OPPOSITE VIEW IS THAT IF YOU PREDICT FUTURE POVERTY ON THE BASIS OF LOW HOUSEHOLD INCOME YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
THIS WAS WORRIED THOSE WHO OPPOSE THAT OPTION OF PRE DESTINATION AT THE REFORMATION THEY ARGUED THAT GOD OFFERED SALVATION TO EVERYONE EVERYONE HAD A CHANCE HE MIGHT NOT EXACTLY EARN YOUR SALVATION BUT YOU COULD CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE TO IT ARE RESPONDING TO GOD'S GRACE
IN THIS ANALOGY MAKING POOR PEOPLE DEPENDENT DOESN'T SET THEM FREE BUT IN PRISON SOME INSTEAD INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR LIVES IT IS POSSIBLE FOR CHILDREN FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS TO DO WELL I SHOULD BE MEASURING THE OTHER FACTORS APART FROM HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT HELP OR HINDER THE BEST OUTCOMES
THIS TRUTH ON BOTH SIDES MOST OF US WOULD ACCEPT THAT WE'RE BOTH SHAPED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE ARE BORN AND THAT WE DO HAVE SOME CAPACITY TO MAKE THE BEST OF OURSELVES THAT IS BOTH PREDESTINATION AND FREE WILL
THE THEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT WAS NEVER QUITE RESOLVED AND CAN'T BE BECAUSE BOTH TRUTH REALLY MATTER
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CANNON ANGELA TELL BEA IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT SEARCH TEAMS ARE AT WORK AT DIDCOT POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE THIS MORNING TRYING TO FIND THE THREE PEOPLE STILL MISSING AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF A TEN STOREY BUILDING ON THE SITE ONE PERSON WAS KILLED AND FIVE INJURED
THE DIDCOT A PLANT WAS BUILT AS A COAL FIRED POWER STATION IN DECOMMISSIONED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AFTER FORTY THREE YEARS IN SERVICE IT'S SIX TOWERS DOMINATED THE LANDSCAPE AROUND THE TOWN THREE OF THEM WERE DEMOLISHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ED BY AUNT WHO RUNS A WEBSITE DEDICATED TO THE HISTORY AND ARCHITECTURE OF THE POWER STATION AND BY MARK ANTONY EDITOR OF DEMOLITION NEWS WHO JOINS US FROM GUILDFORD GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOODNIGHT
MORNING MARK ANTONY CLEARLY ARE TERRIBLY WORRYING TIME FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE THREE PEOPLE STILL MISSING IT SEEMS THAT THE COLLAPSE HAPPENED WHILE THE BUILDING WAS BEING RIGGED FOR DEMOLITION CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT PROCESS LIKE WELL LET ME START BY SAYING THAT MY HEART GOES OUT TO EVERYONE THAT HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS TRAGEDY
THERE'S NEVER ANY SUCH THING AS A GOOD DEMOLITION ACCIDENT BUT THIS ONE WILL BE PUT FELT PARTICULARLY KINGLY BECAUSE THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE COLEMAN COMPANY ARE ALEX BUT THEY ARE A GREAT FAMILY COMPANY AND VERY CLOSE KNIT IN TERMS OF IF YOU QUESTION BASICALLY YOU GOT IT PREPARING FOR AN EXPLOSION OR AN IMPLOSION
JUST BASICALLY MEAN STRIPPING THE BUILDING BACK ALL THE STRUCTURE BACK TO ITS BARE SKELETON OBVIOUSLY RECYCLING THESE DAYS DRIVES A LOT OF DEMOLITION SO THERE'S A LOT OF STRIPPING OUT WORK TO TAKE OUT SALVAGEABLE MATERIAL AND OBVIOUSLY TOOK TO MAKE THE IMPLOSION GO AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT COULD INVOLVE MAKING THE STRUCTURE LESS STABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU WERE STRIPPING OUT
NO NOT GENERALLY BUT BASICALLY YOU ARE PREPARING FOR AN IMPLOSION SO YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT ME AT THAT IMPLOSION TO GO AS SMOOTHLY AS YOU CAN BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'VE GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF OF SAFETY FACTORS AND OBVIOUSLY ON A POWER STATION SORT THOSE THOSE STAIRS ARE EXACT INCREDIBLY EXACTING
YOU'VE ALSO TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT DID DIDCOT IS HE'S VERY OPEN BEING A POWER STATION IT'S IT'S LARGELY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE SO YOU COULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGH WINDS AND THAT KIND OF THING SO I I'D BE VERY SURPRISED IF THE IF THE BUILDING HAD BEEN PRE WEAKEN TO ANY HUGE DEGREE A BIRD YOU KNOW THE THE SITE WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE INTERESTED ESSENTIALLY IN ITS HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE IS THAT RIGHT
AREA IS IT ARCHITECTURALLY IMPORTANT
MARK ANTONY WHAT WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN NOW IS
OBVIOUSLY TERRIBLE OD ON MANY LEVELS BUT PARTICULARLY FOR THE FOR THE FAMILY OF THE PERSON WHO'S DIED AND THOSE WHO ARE STILL MISSING IT MUST MEAN THE WORK HAS TO COME TO WORK TO A TO A COMPLETE STOP EVEN EVEN AFTER THIS SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCESS IS COMPLETED IS THAT RIGHT COS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED THE DEMOLITION BY THE END OF THE YEAR
IT WILL COME TO A TEMPORARY HALT I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY FROM THE COMPANY WILL BE PARTICULARLY KEEN TO GET BACK TO WORK AFTER A TRAGEDY OF THIS TYPE YOU'VE ALSO GOT THE FOR THE FORENSIC INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT IN THE FIRST PLACE AS WELL SO IT IS LIKELY TO IMPACT ON THE PROGRAMME
FRANKLY IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS THAT'S THAT'S A MINOR CONSIDERATION AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE COLLAPSES I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SPECULATE I HAVEN'T I'M THIS PROBABLY ONLY HALF A DOZEN COMPANIES IN THE U.K. THE CAPABLE OF THIS KIND OF WORK COMMON COMPANY WOULD BE WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THAT THEY WON A WORLD DEMOLITION AWARD LAST YEAR AS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD
I I'VE BEEN TO THE SITE THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE THE SAFETY STANDARDS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY EXEMPLARY IT FROM WHAT I CAN I CAN SEE SO FAR IT'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY AND EDVARD YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE DEMOLITION PROGRESS OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO
THEY THAT IS TO BE THE VOICE ONCE OR TWICE IF I'VE GOT TO KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE POISON THOUGH LIKEWISE I I REALLY FEEL I'M ALL OVER THIS TIME MARK THAT THERE WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE COMPANY
I'D BUY OUD FROM DIDCOT POWER STATION DOT COM THE WEBSITE AND MARK ANTONY EDITOR OF DEMOLITION NEWS THANK YOU BOTH THE TIMES NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST AND CHRIS FAWKES IS BACK WITH A FELLA CHRIS THAT'S A SARAH WELL A FREEZING COLD START TO THE MORNING TEMPERATURES DIP DOWN TO MINUS SEVEN CELSIUS IN THE COLDEST SPOTS THAT'S NORTHUMBERLAND AND ALSO YORKSHIRE WHICH TANK FOR THE COLDEST PLACE THIS MORNING

CLOSEST OF RIGHT
THE SIX NATIONS CONTINUES ON FRIDAY NIGHT WITH WALES VERSUS FRANCE KICKING OFF AT FIVE PAST EIGHT LIVE ON B. B. C. ONE AND ACROSS THE B.B.C.
IN THE NEXT HOUR THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MARTIN SCHULTZ AND THE MAN WHO DECIDED TO LIVE AS A GOAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING ONE OF THE LEADING OUT CAMPAIGNERS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM MICHAEL GOES HAS SAID THE DEAL RESHAPING BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING RESCUE TEAMS ARE SEARCHING FOR THREE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN THE RUBBLE OF THE COLLAPSED POWER STATION IN OXFORDSHIRE
DONALD TRUMP IS CELEBRATING HIS THIRD VICTORY IN A ROW IN THE CONTEST TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND ASTON MARTIN IS TO BUILD A NEW CAR PLANT IN WALES CREATING HUNDREDS OF JOBS THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY SUSAN RAY
THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOLD HAS CHALLENGED THE PRIME MINISTER'S ASSERTION THAT HIS DEAL WITH E.U. LEADERS PAVING THE WAY FOR A REFERENDUM ON BRITISH MEMBERSHIP IS LEGALLY BINDING IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE DECLARING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN MY GOPHERS TOLD B.B.C. NEWS THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE COULD OVERTURN THE CHANGES BEFORE THEY ARE INCORPORATED INTO E.U. TREATIES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE
HE ALSO SAYS PULLING OUT OF THE E.U. WILL BE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITAIN TO RECOVER ITS MOJO MY GOALS WERE SPEAKING TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA BACK SO IT BEGINS NOT JUST RIVALS BUT POLITICAL FRIENDS THE CLOSEST KIND MAKING STRONG BUT CONTRADICTORY CLAIMS IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
DAVID CAMERON HAS BOASTED THAT THE DEAL HE SECURED IN BRUSSELS WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS IS LEGALLY BINDING AND CANNOT BE REVERSED HE BELIEVES THE PROMISES IN THE DEAL HAVE LEGAL FORCE AND THAT THEY WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO E.U. LAW AS PART OF TREATY AGREEMENT IN THE FUTURE
BUT IN HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE ANNOUNCING HIS DECISION TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE MAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGLISH LEGAL SYSTEM MICHAEL GO SUGGESTS THAT EUROPEAN JUDGES COULD THROW OUT THE CHANGES THAT MISTER CAMERON FOUGHT SO HARD TO ACHIEVE AND HE URGES PHOTOS TO REALISE THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT STILL STANDS ABOVE EVERY NATION STATE NOTHING HE BELIEVES IN THE DEAL WILL CHANGE THAT
THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE INTERPRETS THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATIES AND UNTIL THIS AGREEMENT IS EMBODIED IN TREATY CHANGE THEN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS NOT BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT
GIVEN HIS ROLE AND HIS CLOSENESS TO THE PRIME MINISTER MY GHOST COMMENTS HAVE CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS FRAUGHT CAMPAIGN
NUMBER TEN HAS ISSUED THIS STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO MY GOATS REMARKS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THIS DEAL IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING BRITAIN'S NEW SETTLEMENT IN THE E.U. HAS LEGAL FORCE AND IS AN IRREVERSIBLE INTERNATIONAL LAW DECISION THAT REQUIRES THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
THIRTEEN FORMER MILITARY CHIEFS HAVE DECLARED THEIR SUPPORT FOR BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP IN A LETTER TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THEY SAY THE COUNTRY WILL BE IN A STRONGER POSITION TO TACKLE GLOBAL SECURITY THREATS INSIDE THE E.U. THE SIGNATORIES INCLUDE FOUR FORMER CHIEFS OF THE DEFENCE STAFF TO PREVIOUS FIRST SEA LORD AND TWO FORMER HEADS OF THE ARMY HE WAS A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BEALE
THE LETTER WHICH WAS RELEASED BY DOWNING STREET'S MAKES VERY SIMILAR ARGUMENTS ALREADY PUT FORWARD BY DAVID CAMERON AS TO WHY BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE DEFENCE CHIEFS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NATO'S THE CORNERSTONE OF BRITAIN'S SECURITY THEY ARGUE THE E.U. HAS ALSO BECOME AN IMPORTANT PILLAR HELPING GIVE A UNITED RESPONSE TO THREATS RANGING FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE TO A RESURGENT RUSSIA
LIKE DAVID CAMERON THEY CONCLUDE THAT BRITAIN WILL BE SAFER INSIDE THE E.U. THAN OUT A CLAIM THAT'S BEEN HOTLY DISPUTED BY THE OTHER SIDE AND NOT EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY WILL NECESSARILY SHARE THEIR VIEWS AT LEAST TO DEFENCE MINISTERS PENNY MORDANT AND JULIAN BRAZIER ARE BACKING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
THE SEARCH IS CONTINUING FOR THREE PEOPLE MISSING AFTER HALF OF A DECOMMISSIONED POWER STATION COLLAPSED AT DIDCOT IN OXFORDSHIRE YESTERDAY ONE PERSON HAS DIED FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL A CORRESPONDENT BEN MORE REPORTS FROM THE SCENE
POLICE ARE STILL MANNING A CHORD AND ONE HUNDRED METRES OUT FROM THE DIDCOT A SIGHT AS EXTENSIVE SEARCH AND RESCUE WORK CONTINUED OVERNIGHT OXFORD FIRE AND RESCUE SERVICE ARE IN COMMAND AND HAVE HELP FROM SPECIALIST URBAN RESCUE TEAMS WITH SNIFFER DOGS FROM ACROSS THE U.K.
THEY HOPE TO FIND THE MISSING THREE PEOPLE WHO COULD STILL BE ALIVE THE TASK IS NOT INCONSIDERABLE THOUGH HALF OF THE THREE HUNDRED METRE LONG TURBINE HALL HAS COLLAPSED IN ITS PLACE A THIRTY FOOT HIGH PILE OF RUBBLE THAT'S DESCRIBED AS UNSTABLE
THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE HAVE BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION BUT THIS OPERATION IS EXPECTED TO LAST FOR DAYS
DONALD TRUMP HAS SCORED AN EMPHATIC VICTORY IN NEVADA IN THE LATER STAGE OF THE RACE FOR THE U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION SENATOR TED CRUISIN SENATOR MARKLE RUBIO ARE COMPETING FOR SECOND PLACE OUR CORRESPONDENT JAMES COOKE REPORTS FROM LAS VEGAS DONALD TRUMP GOES MARCHING ON THE MAN WHO WAS REGARDED BY MANY AS A CURIOSITY WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HE WANTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IT'S NOW THE FAVOURITE TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOMINATION AND BY SOME DISTANCE
HIS TRIUMPH IN NEVADA FOLLOWS VICTORIES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SOUTH CAROLINA WE ARE WINNING WINNING WINNING SAID MISTER TRUMP IN A VICTORY SPEECH HIGHLIGHTING HIS SUPPORT ACROSS THE DEMOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM INCLUDING AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS WE KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU THAT O.K.
GREAT PLACE GREAT EVENING WE WILL BE CELEBRATING FOR A LONG TIME
AND SOUL SENIOR REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS AND DONORS PANICKED AT THE THOUGHT OF AN OUTSIDER TAKING OVER THEIR PARTY AND NOW RALLYING AROUND MARCO RUBIO AS THEIR PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE BUT TED CREW STRONG CASE HE CAN BEND CARSON ALL REMAIN IN THE RACE AND AS LONG AS THE ANTI TRUMP VOTE IS SPLIT THE PROPERTY TYCOON LOOKS ALMOST UNSTOPPABLE
ASTON MARTIN HAS ENDED A GLOBAL SEARCH FOR A SITE FOR A NEW CAR PLANT BY PICKING A LOCATION IN SOUTH WALES WORK ON THE FACTORY AT SAINT ATHENS WILL START NEXT YEAR IT SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL BY TWENTY TWENTY THE WELSH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL BE THE FIRST CAR PRODUCTION LINE IN WALES FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS HE'S OUR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT JOHN MORE THAN
ASTON MARTIN MAKES ITS ICONIC SPORTS CARS AT GAYDON IN WARWICKSHIRE BUT FOR THE PAST YEAR IT'S BEEN EVALUATING LOCATIONS WORLDWIDE INCLUDING IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST FOR ITS NEW PLANT IN THE END SAINT ATHENS IN THE VALE OF GLAMORGAN BEAT OFF ALL THE COMPETITION
THE NINETY ACRE SITE HAS M.O.D. LAND ASTON MARTIN INTENDS TO TRANSFORM SOME EXISTING SUPER HANGERS INTO A NEW STATE OF THE ART PRODUCTION FACILITY THE PLANT WOULD CREATE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY HIGH SKILLED JOBS WITH A FURTHER ONE THOUSAND EXPECTED IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOCAL BUSINESSES
THE NEW VEHICLE THE D.B. X. IS AIMED AT THE FAST GROWING MARKET FOR LUXURY CROSSOVER VEHICLES WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY IN DEMAND BY THE WORLD'S SUPER RICH
GREECE HAS LODGED A FORMAL DIPLOMATIC COMPLAINT AGAINST AUSTRIA AFTER BEING EXCLUDED FROM A MEETING ON THE MIGRATION CRISIS BEING HELD TODAY IN VIENNA MINISTERS FROM BALKAN COUNTRIES WILL BE TAKING PART THEIR DECISION TO TIGHTEN THEIR BORDERS HAS BEEN CRITICISED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AS I WAS EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
THE STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM CAUSED BY MASS MIGRATION INTO SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS BEEN SHOWING FOR MONTHS BUT THIS COULD BE A NEW PHASE IN THE CRISIS HAS COUNTRIES ARGUE AMONGST THEMSELVES AND BEGIN TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION
LAST WEEK AUSTRIA DECIDED TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS CROSSING ITS TERRITORY AND DEPOSE A DAILY LIMIT ON ASYLUM CLAIMS IT WAS A MOVE CONDEMNED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AS ILLEGAL AND IT'S NOW PROVOKED A CHAIN REACTION OF BORDER CLOSURES ELSEWHERE IN THE BALKANS
THE DECISION BY MACEDONIA TO PREVENT AFGHAN ASYLUM SEEKERS HEADING NORTH FROM GREECE IS OF PARTICULAR CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE SO MANY AFGHANS HAVE ARRIVED IN THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY IN RECENT DAYS SOON IF NOTHING CHANGES GREECE WILL BE UNABLE TO COPE AND BRUSSELS IS WARNING OF A BREWING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THE POLITICAL CRISIS IS ALREADY WELL UNDERWAY
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS GIVEN MORE DETAILS OF THE REVIEW IT'S ORDERED INTO HOW IT DEALT WITH THE DISGRACED FORMER BISHOP PETER BALL THE INQUIRY FOLLOWS CLAIMS THAT THE CHURCH COVERED UP THE FULL EXTENT OF ITS KNOWLEDGE OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE CARRIED OUT BY HIM HE'S A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT BISHOP PETER BALL WHO'S NOW EIGHTY THREE AND WAS JAILED LAST YEAR AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO ABUSING EIGHTEEN YOUNG MEN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WHEN HE WAS BISHOP OF LEWES
HE RESIGNED AS BISHOP OF GLOUCESTER IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AFTER ONE SURVIVOR OF HIS ABUSE WENT TO THE POLICE HOWEVER THE BISHOPS ACCEPTANCE OF A POLICE CAUTION AT THE TIME MEANT THAT HE AVOIDED MORE SERIOUS CHARGES UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION WAS REOPENED SOME TWO DECADES LATER
NOW THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF ITS HANDLING OF THE CASE WILL BE LED BY DAY MOIRA AGAIBH A FORMER DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CAMDEN COUNCIL IN A LETTER TO THOSE ABUSED BY BALL SHE SAID THE REVIEW WOULD SEEK TO ESTABLISH WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN ABOUT PAUL'S BEHAVIOUR SHE SAID HER INTENTION WAS THAT THE CHURCH LEARN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE FROM THE TERRACE
THE REVIEW IS EXPECTED TO LAST A YEAR AND HER TEAM WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MATERIAL AND FILES HELD BY THE CHURCH AT LAMBETH PALACE AND DIMPLES FORMER GUY SEES THEM ON CASTRO THE ELDER BROTHER OF CUBA'S FORMER AND CURRENT LEADERS FIDEL AND RAUL CASTRO HAS DIED IN HAVANA HE WAS NINETY ONE HE DIDN'T PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THE REVOLUTION THAT BROUGHT HIS BROTHERS TO POWER BUT HE DID GO ON TO SET UP SEVERAL STATE COMPANIES
TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT BE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO MARTIN SCHULTZ HAS SAID HE IS CONVINCED THAT BRITAIN WILL VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM FOR THE B.B.C. PROGRAMME HARD TORQUAY TOLD ME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME A CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER IS FIGHTING FOR THE E.U. AND THAT HE SAID HIS PROGRESS AND SOMETHING THAT HE AND POT CREDITED TO BORIS JOHNSON JOHNSON ENTERING THE DEBATE
HE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE MAYOR SUGGESTED THEY DEVOTE TO LEAVE COULD PROMPT AMOR FONT FUNDAMENTAL RENEGOTIATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH HIM IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY I ASKED FIRST IF DAVID CAMERON HAD GOT A GOOD DEAL FROM THE OTHER LEADERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK YES IT WAS A DIFFICULT NEGOTIATION BUT PREPARE UP AND MY PARLIAMENT CONTRIBUTED A LOT TO IMPROVE THE PAPERS ON THE TABLE AT THE END I THINK HE HAS THERE'S A DEAL
OH HELP TOO I HOPE
TO CONVINCE BRITISH WOOL TO STILL STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S A FAR CRY FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL FAR REACHING CHANGE THAT HE INITIALLY PROMISED WHEN HE WENT INTO THE NEGOTIATION ISN'T IT I THINK THERE IS A CHANGE TO LOOK TO THE FOUR SECTIONS OF THIS NEGOTIATION PAPER BUT ON THE BASIS OF THE PAPER YOU WILL FIND A LOT OF THINGS
ASKED FOR HER SPECIALLY THE AGREEMENT ON THAT I'M NOT MAKING BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE COMMISSION MEMBER STATES SHOWED THAT A LOT OF
WESTS OF DAVID CAMERON LESS BURDEN FOR SMALLER MEDIUM ENTERPRISES MOYA EFFECTIVENESS LESS BUREAUCRACY YOU MORE TRANSPARENCY HAS ALREADY EVEN THOUGH THEY AGREEMENTS ALERTING THE DEAL WAS BASED ON SOME MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THIS NOT LEAST THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER WHO SAYS THAT WE KNOW REVISION OF TREATIES KNOLE VITA'S FOR THE U.K. OVER REINFORCEMENT OF THE IN A NO CALLING INTO QUESTION THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE CIRCULATION
THAT'S DIFFERENT CERTAINLY FROM WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD THE U.K. WHICH IS THAT THIS WILL BE LEGALLY BINDING AND IRREVERSIBLE BECAUSE IT WILL BE IN THE TREATIES OF THE E.U.
DEAL WITH UNITED KINGDOM WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR NEVER CLOSE A UNION IS LEGALLY OR NOT BINDING FOR THE OTHER KINGDOM THAT WAS AGREED TO IN TWENTY EIGHT MEMBER STATES IN THE FUTURE TWENTY CHANGE THERE WILL BE WRITTEN EXACTLY LITERALLY LIKE A DEER IN THE TREATY
SO NOBODY CAN TELL INTO BRITISH WATERS OF BOOKINGS THERE WAS WRITTEN CLEARLY ON THE PAPER
OH KAY ON MIGRANTS AND BENEFITS WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG ISSUE AND CAUSED A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THEN WAS AS A RESULT OF THIS STILL THERE WILL BE CHANGES TO IN WORK BENEFITS THERE'S A FOUR YEAR TAPIR THAT CAN BE IN PLACE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THEN THEY'LL BE PAYING OF CHILD BENEFIT AT THE COST OF LIVING FROM THE MIGRANTS OWN COUNTRY
DO YOU THINK THE EFFECT OF THOSE CHANGES TO BENEFITS WILL PUT E.U. MIGRANTS OF GOING TO THE U.K. DON'T BELIEVE SO
THE WHOLE EXERCISE OR IT'LL PUT TECTOR YOU'RE NOT PICKING THEM FOR THE TIME BEING TO BE ABUSED WITH THE SYSTEM OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND THEN THE TEMPORARY LIMITED TIME I THINK BECAUSE ADMISSIBLE
SOME DIFFERENCE OF SPLIT THREE IN THE U.K. CITIZENS ARE NON CITIZENS IF THERE'S US TEMPORARY LIMIT
THIS IS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES DID THE SAME AFTER THE USE OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES JOINED THE EUROPEAN UNION SOME OF THE MEMBER STATES MY OWN INCLUDED HEAD OF SEVEN YEARS
PERIOD FOR FREE EGGS JUST TO THE LABOUR MARKET BY THE WAY IT WAS THE UNITED KINGDOM WHICH DID HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ALLOWING IT BUT MY QUESTION IS DIFFERENT MY QUESTIONNAIRES WILL IT PUT E.U. MIGRANTS OFF AND YOU SAY NO YOU DON'T THINK SO FOR THE TIME BEING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM DESCRIBED THE SITUATION
THE SITUATION WAS THE JUSTIFICATION TO GET THIS OPT OUT
AND THEY ARE SAID TO HAVE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION AS LOGICALLY IF THERE IS THEN APPLY I THINK THAT WILL LEAD TO LESS MIGRATION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE KEY IS THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM ARGUES FOR TOO MUCH AND THEREFORE BE ONE THERE ROBBED THEM I UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION AS A QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE
WE THAT IN FUTURE TIMES UNTIL THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO PREDICT BUT I PRESUME THAT THE ODD OLD IS ASKED TO APPROVE
MUCH IN THE UNITED KINGDOM YOU WILL KNOW THAT DAVID CAMERON CAME BACK AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE NOT LEAST JACOB REES MOGG A TORY M.P. WHO SAID THERE'S SO MUCH LABOUR HE HAS CHEEK ACHIEVED SO LITTLE AND IT WAS THIS ARGUMENT THAT ACTUALLY
YOU HAD EVERYBODY TALKING ABOUT CHILD BENEFIT OR THE TAPERING ON IN WORK BENEFITS THESE ARE TINY DICK LITTLE DETAILS THAT I'M NOT THE FUNDAMENTAL REFORM
THAT A LOT OF BRITAIN WANT SCISSORS BECAUSE SHE AMATEURS AS BECAUSE I CAN'T COMMEND BOLD AND RE OBSERVATION OF ANY BIT VENTURE OF THE TORIES OH KAY LET'S CUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE M.P. THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON BECAUSE HE ARGUES BUT YOU MAY SAY THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT WITH ALL THESE FACTORS BUT HE THINKS THERE IS A BETTER
BIGGER NEGOTIATION THAT CAN BE HAD AND HE'S ARGUING CAMPAIGNING FOR TO LEAVE THE E.U. BECAUSE HE SAYS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THE CHANGE WE NEED AND THAT IS TO VOTE TO GO
BECAUSE ALL E.U. HISTORY SHOWS THEY ONLY REALLY LISTEN TO A POPULATION WHEN IT SAYS NO I'D LIKE TO BE IN A REFORMED Y. YOU THAT'S MY HOPE AND E.U. THAT'S BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL TREATY
I HAVE NOTHING TO COMMEND THE BOD BORIS JOHNSON TO WHAT HE IS DOING BUT ONE THING IS FOR ME NOT CLEARER SINCE BORIS JOHNSON USED PUT EXPRESSED HIS VIEW FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE A LONG TIME THE CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IS FIGHT
FOR EUROPE AND FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS IS A PROGRESS IN ITSELF SO BORIS JOHNSON CONTRIBUTED TO A REAL CHANGE IN EUROPE THE BORIS JOHNSON IS SUGGESTING SOMETHING ELSE THAT THERE COULD BE A SECOND REFERENDUM THERE COULD BE A SECOND RENEGOTIATION
MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ THE CONCLUSIONS I'M MY MY FEELING IS ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO CLARIFICATION PRIME MINISTER IN THAT THE KINGDOM IS RUNNING FOR THE COMPLAINT OR STAY IN SO THAT MAKES HIM
BECAUSE IT IS NOT A BOLT TORREY DEBATE IT IS ABOUT WINNING THE CONFIDENCE
OF BRITISH VOTERS OF HORROR BRITISH ROAD AND THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR A BIGGER CUP BUT HE MIGHT NOT WIN HE WILL
HOW DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I AM CONFIDENT THAT
NOT ONLY CONFIDENT I'M CONVINCED IT WAS ANOTHER ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED THAT OF MIGRATION IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS THERE'S A FRUSTRATION THAT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT ESPECIALLY IN GERMANY I THINK FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND IT NECESSARY SORRY VERITY WITH OTHER COUNTRIES BUT ALSO MOVED IN IN MY EYES AND THE GOOD DIRECTION I HOPE THAT ON THE SEVENTH OF MARCH WITH ME AGAIN WITH THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT THAN THEM IF HE APPLIED TO THE SO CALLED
MEASURE PICKER WITH TURKEY AND EVERY CONTROLLED THE BORDERS MORE EFFECTIVELY START OF MODELS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY HAVE THE WE TRANSFER OVER THOSE WHO HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT RIDE TO STAY AS POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF THE RELOCATION SCHEME WE AGREE ON
REALLY AYE PUDDING FOUR'S DERMOT THE OTHER GOOD CHURNS TO MANAGE THEIR CRIES AND SOLUTION IS A FEAR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE REFUGEES AMONGST THE TWENTY MEMBER STATES AND YET THERE ISN'T IN UNI AND YET THERE IS NO MOVEMENT TOWARDS THAT FOR ALL THAT PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE E.U. ARE EFFECTIVELY DITCHING SHOWING AND I'M CLOSING THEIR BORDERS EXCITEDLY
NATIONAL INTEREST INSTEAD OF COMMON UNION SPIRIT THIS IS EUROPE WHICH NIGEL FOR OUCH ONE STUSSY IT'S YOUR A LEADING INTO A DISASTER OH KAY BUT ON THEIR MIGRATION QUESTION
WHAT IS HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT COUNTRIES ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THE REDISTRIBUTION
A GIFT OF LOVE THE PRIDE TO COMMUNES THAT NEEDS A PRAGMATIC SOLUTION ON THE BASIS OF OUR YOUR MONEY DARIAN RESPONSIBILITY THE RICHEST PART OF THE WORLD
VERY EGOISTIC CAN SOME MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION GERMANY'S REFUGEES COULD AND SHOULD COME TO GERMANY AND THAT I EXPECT FROM OTHER RICH COUNTRIES
THAT THEY ARE AS SOLID AS FOR EXAMPLE A COUNTRY LIKE JORDAN OR LIVE ON THEM THE REFUGEE CRISIS BRITAIN LEAVING
CAN YOU REMEMBER A TIME CAN YOU THINK OF A TIME WHEN THE E.U. WAS UNDER THREAT AS IT IS NOW IS THERE A DANGER IT COULD TEAR ITSELF APART THAT'S WHAT I REPEAT PERMANENTLY NUMBER IN MY POLITICAL ALLY HAVE NEVER IN MY TIME AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT I SAW THE UNION IN SUCH A DRAMATIC SHAPE
THEREFORE THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BY PICKING THE WARSAW STEP FORWARD IF BRITISH VOTERS VOTE YES TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A SING THEM OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ALL OF US
MARTIN SHORT'S TALKING TO ME FOR HARD TALKING YOU CAN SEE THAT PROGRAMME OR INDEED HEAR IT ON THE NEWS CHANNEL ON B. B. C. WORLD WORLD SERVICE OR OF COURSE ON I.P. AND INCIDENTALLY THE COMETS FROM MICHAEL GO TH THAT QUESTIONING JUST HOW PERMANENT HOW LEGALLY BINDING THAT IS WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT OF COURSE WITHIN THE NEXT OUT OF THE PIT
THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT A GROUP OF SENIOR DOCTORS INCLUDING THE QUEEN'S FORMER PHYSICIAN IS RAISING CONCERNS TODAY ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ON THE N.H.S. THE SIX DOCTORS INCLUDE SIR RICHARD THOMPSON WHO ALSO SERVED AS PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND HE SAYS WE NEED A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO THE WAY THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUGS IS ASSESSED
A GROUP OF DOCTORS AS LED BY THE CONSULTANT CARDIOLOGIST DOCTOR MULHALL TREVOR WHO'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE SHOW AND YOU SAY THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY AN EPIDEMIC OF MISINFORMED DOCTORS AND MISINFORMED PATIENTS ABSOLUTELY MICHELLE I MEAN FIRST THING TO SAY IS WE HAVE A COMPLETE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FAILURE WHERE WE ARE PRESCRIBING TOO MUCH MEDICINE
AND THE ROOT CAUSE BEHIND THIS PROBLEM WHICH IS RESULTING AS YOU SAY AND I HAVE SAID AN EPIDEMIC ARE MISINFORMED OXEN ARE MISINFORMED PATIENTS IS BIASED FUNDING OF RESEARCH THAT'S RESUS IT'S FUNDED BECAUSE IT'S LIKE TO BE PROFITABLE NOT BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS BIASED REPORTING MEDICAL JOURNALS BIASED REPORTING THE MEDIA AND COMMERCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THESE ARE VERY
SWEEPING ALLEGATIONS TO MAKE WHAT WHAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE LINKS AREN'T THERE BETWEEN INTERESTED PARTIES SO FOR EXAMPLE DRUGS COMPANIES AND DOCTORS THEY MIGHT ATTEND THE SAME MEETINGS AND GO TO THE SAME THINGS BECAUSE THAT THAT IS THEIR WORK SEE RIGHT MICHELLE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THIS AS A AS A WHOLE SYSTEM PROBLEM ISSUE BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS AT EVERY LEVEL ARE BEING INFLUENCED BY COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS BUT IT'S RESULTING A LOT OF HARM SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
THE F.D.A. NOW REPORTS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DEATHS TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BECAUSE OF A DRESS TOOK REACTIONS WHICH HAS TRIPLED IN A DECADE THAT'S IN THE UNITED STATES HAD STATES PETER GOTCHA CO FOUNDER OF CUT COCHRANE CLUB COLLABORATION RECENTLY DIDN'T ALISON B.M.J. LOOKING JUST AT PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS AND HIS ESTIMATE WAS HALF A MILLION DEATHS BEING CAUSED BECAUSE OF MEDICATIONS THAT ARE OVER PRESCRIBED AND THESE THIS IS IN THE U.S.A. AND EUROPE COMBINED EUROPEAN UNION
YOU DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AS FAR AS THE U.K. IS CONCERNED I DO THERE IS EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE I MEAN THE THING IS WE'VE SEEN VERY RECENTLY FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION BY THE B.M.J. THAT ACTUALLY SHOWED THAT ONE OF THE DRUGS WE'VE BEEN USING THE LAST FEW YEARS IN GOOD FAITH WHICH IS A BLOOD THINNING CHUCKLE RIVER ROCKS A BAND AT THE DEVICE USING THE ORIGINAL TRIAL PUBLISHED IN ONE OF THE MAJOR MEDICAL JOHNS WAS FAULTY BASICALLY GIVING CASTING HUGE DOUBTS ON TO THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL BUT BUT MICHELLE THIS TO SAY
THE END OF THE EVIDENCE ON THIS IN TERMS OF IN THE U.K. WE KNOW ABOUT A QUARTER OF HOSPITAL MISSIONS IN THE ELDERLY OR BECAUSE A BAD RESTAURANT REACTIONS WANTING THREE OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTY FIVE IF YOU'RE ELDERLY NEW FOR YOU FRACTURE HER HIP THEN A COURSE OF THE SPACES WILL DIE THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AND DRUGS COMPANIES AND OTHERS WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE MEDICATION WHEN YOU'VE SPOKEN UP BEFORE FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE USE OF OF STATINS AND YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S THAT STUFF
WHEN YOU OPEN YOU WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THIS IN THE IN THE B.M.J. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH SENT SIDE EFFECTS ARE STATINS OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT RESEARCH WAS FLAWED AND LATER ACKNOWLEDGED AS FLAWED SO YOU'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE WHEN YOU SPOKE IN A SHOWER THE RAM VERY GLAD YOU RAISED THAT POINT I'M VERY GLAD YOU RAISED THAT POINT BECAUSE WE HAVE WRITTEN AN EDITORIAL RECENTLY WITH SIMON KATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY ON THE OVERALL DATA ON SATURN SINCE THEM LIKE THAT THE TWENTY PERCENT FIGURE WAS WITHDRAWN
THAT TWENTY PERCENT WE FIGURE WAS CORRECTED ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU NOW IT IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY AN UNDERESTIMATE IN FACT ACTUALLY THE SIDE EFFECTS IN TERMS OF SIDE EFFECTS IN THROUGH THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE MAY WELL BE HIGHER AND OTHERS TELL YOU WHY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ADD WITH I WANT TO TALK TO THEIR PROFESSORS HAVE ELECTED A MOMENT UP ABOUT THIS BUT IF I PRESUME THAT IF YOU BELIEVE DIFFERENTLY YOU'LL PUT FORWARD EVIDENCE FOR THAT IN A SUBSEQUENT PEACE
THERE HAS BEEN ACTUALLY IT'S LAST TWO WEEKS FROM MICHELLE TO LORRIES YOUR CUT REPEAT A CARDIOLOGIST IN FRANCE'S ZESTED NOW THAT THE WHOLE EVIDENCE BASED BEHIND STATINS THEMSELVES AS VERY QUESTIONABLE EVEN FOR EFFICACY IN AAU PATIENT GROUPS ALL RIGHT WELL PROFESSOR SIR ROBERT NECKLACE ALSO HERE IN THE STUDIO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE'S NOW YOU AT THE ACADEMY HAVE BEEN ASKED BY THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER TO LOOK INTO THIS THIS SAME ISSUE OF THE OF THE INFLUENCE OF OF OF THE ALL ACTUALLY REALLY THE EVALUATION OF DRUGS
IS THERE A PROBLEM WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT DOCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TRAINED TO PRACTISE EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE AND TO INDULGE IN EVIDENCE BASED PRESCRIBING AND I THINK THE MEDICAL PROFESSION DOES THAT I'LL BE PERFECT OR DOING IT NO WE'RE NOT SO ARE THERE SOME OCCASIONS WHEN DRUGS MAYBE OVER PRESCRIBED PROBABLY SO CERTAINLY ANTIBIOTICS
WE NOW RECOGNISE WERE EXCESSIVELY USED AND WE ARE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE HAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF AN IN COURSE ADJUSTMENT BUT THE NOTION THAT THERE IS A GREAT CULTURE OF OVER PRESCRIBING I DON'T RECOGNISE AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO OVER PRESCRIBED THERE'S NO REWARD FOR PRESCRIBING DRUGS IN THIS COUNTRY FORTUNATELY SO I THINK THE KEY IS TO ALWAYS BE RIGOUROUS ABOUT A VALUATION AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE
NICE MEASUREMENTS YOU'D HAVE HEALTH AND CLINICAL EXCELLENCE WHICH IS A VERY RIGOUROUS EVALUATOR OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE ACADEMY'S LAUNCHED INTO A PIECE OF WORK NOW TO SEE HOW SOCIETY EVALUATES EVIDENCE BECAUSE IT NEEDS A PUBLIC DEBATE IT'S NOT SOGGY COMMENTS HOW CAN SOCIETY EVALUATE EVIDENCE WE WANT WE WANT A DECENT RIGOUROUS SYSTEM WHERE THE SYSTEM EVALUATE WELL I THINK THIS IS THE WAY OURS BUT SOME OF THE DATA COMING OUT IT'S CONFUSING I THINK SATURN IS A VERY GOOD CASE IN POINT THERE HAVE BEEN CONFUSING MESSAGES COMING OUT ABOUT STATINS AND SOME OF THE RISK BENEFIT ANALYSES ARE QUITE SUBTLE
SO I THINK THAT WE DO NEED A PUBLIC DIALOGUE AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD DECIDE AT WHAT LEVEL OF RISK IT IS SENSIBLE FOR THEM TO MEDICATE OR NOT SO I THINK IT DOES NEED A PUBLIC DEBATE AND THE ACADEMY'S PIECE OF WORK IS LOOKING AT THAT IT'S LOOKING AT RISK IT'S LOOKING AT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND HOW BEST TO MANAGE THAT IS TO AVOID BIAS AND IT'S ALSO
YOU'RE GOING TO GOING TO LOOK AT HOW TO COMMUNICATE RISK MORE EFFECTS WHAT ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OR PERHAPS OVER INFLUENCE OR UNDUE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUGS INDUSTRY ON THE N.H.S. FOR IT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SORTS OF DRUGS THAT ARE DEVELOPED THAT THE ACCUSATION THAT MORE MONEY IS PUT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS THAT ARE MORE PROFITABLE RATHER THAN PERHAPS MORE ORDINARY BUT MUCH NEEDED DRUGS LIKE ANTIBIOTICS SO OF COURSE FARMERS WHO'D HAVE INDUSTRIES WILL
TEND TO GO WHERE THERE IS A PROFIT MARGIN TO BE MADE OTHERWISE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MAKE THE DRUG I THINK THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE AND SO THERE IS HUGE UNMET NEED WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET DRUGS DEVELOPS IN THE RIGHT PLACES BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT I THINK IS THAT IT'S VITAL THAT THE ACADEMIC WORLD AND
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN THE BATTLE AGAINST THE N.H.S. WORKED TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THE UNMET NEED I THINK IS RATHER THAN ANY SUGGESTION BUT IT'S BAD FOR COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY IT'S ESSENTIAL HIS COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP BETTER DRUGS FOR THOSE UNMET NEEDS PROFESSOR SIR ROBERT SLACK LA AND DOCTOR SEYMOUR THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND SCENA LEASE BACK WITH US NO THANK YOU SARAH ARSENAL HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A MAMMOTH HURDLE TO JUMP TO REACH THE QUARTER FINALS OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS THEY LOST TWO NIL TO BARCELONA IN THE FIRST LEG OF THEIR LAST SIXTEEN TIE AT THE EMIRATES STADIUM LAST NIGHT

MAYBE THE WEATHER IT'S GONNA BE COLD AND SUNNY VERY COLD IN SOME PLACES THERE'S GONNA BE SOME WINTRY SHOWERS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE SUSAN RAY HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO SAYS DAVID CAMERON'S DEAL ON NEW TERMS FOR BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. COULD BE REVERSED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HE SAID THE COURT WASN'T BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE IT HASN'T YET BEEN WRITTEN INTO AN E.U. TREATY THAT DOWNING STREET HAS REJECTED MY INTERPRETATION IT SAID THE DEAL HAD LEGAL FORCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH REQUIRED THE EUROPEAN COURT TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT
THIRTEEN OF THE U.K.'S MOST SENIOR FORMER MILITARY FIGURES HAVE SIGNED A LETTER ARGUING THAT BRITAIN A SAFER IN THE U. Y. U. AND BETTER ABLE TO MEET GLOBAL THREATS AT LEAST TO DEFENCE MINISTERS ARE BACKING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
RESCUE TEAM SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF THE POWER STATION THAT COLLAPSED AND OXFORDSHIRE SO THEIR DOGS HAVE YET TO DETECT SIGNS OF THREE MISSING PEOPLE ONE PERSON DIED WHEN PART OF THE TURBINE HALL AT DIDCOT CAME DOWN YESTERDAY
DONALD TRUMP HAS SCORED A THIRD CONCERT CONSECUTIVE VICTORY IN THE RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE UNITED STATES PARTIAL RESULTS SUGGEST HE WON MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN THE DIVIDER CARCASSES
IT'S NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE HAS CHALLENGED THE PRIME MINISTER'S ASSERTION THAT HIS DEAL WITH E.U. LEADERS PAVING THE WAY FOR A REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP IS LEGALLY BINDING MY I'VE TOLD B.B.C. NEWS THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE
COULD OVERTURN THE CHANGES BEFORE THEY'RE INCORPORATED INTO E.U. TREATIES NUMBER TEN STRONGLY DISAGREES WITH MY GOATS VIEW AND ON THE LINE WE HAVE THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL DOMINIC GRIEVE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHO DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT
MICHAEL GAVE HIS WRONG ABOUT THIS QUITE PLAIN THAT THE TREATY THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE REACHED HAS LEGAL FALLS IT'LL HAVE LEGAL FALLS FROM THE DAY ON WHICH WE INDICATE AFTER A REFERENDUM THAT WE WISH TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND AFTER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT CAN BE RAISED IN ANY COURT CASE WHICH IS WHERE IT'S RELEVANT AND THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT BUT EXACTLY TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT NOT BE BOUND BY IT
ALL COURTS HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND BE BOUND BY WHAT HE'S SAID I THINK THIS IS A BIT OF AN EXERCISE IN SEMANTICS ULTIMATELY MICHAEL GOES PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE THAT HE JUST DOESN'T TRUST THE COURT
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THOUGHT THE PRIME MINISTER CAME BACK WITH RATHER A GOOD DEAL LIZ THAT HE'S CLARIFIED A NUMBER OF AREAS OF THE U.K. STATUS WITHIN YOU IN A WAY WHICH I THINK IS REALLY VERY GOOD I'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR THIS FOR SOME TIME AND WAS PLEASED TO SEE IT THE COURT CAN'T IGNORE THAT AND THE FACT THAT IT HASN'T YET BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE TREATIES
IN MY VIEW IS IRRELEVANT IT WOULD STILL CANNOT BE IGNORED THEREFORE ALTHOUGH ONE NOBODY CAN SAY EXACTLY HOW THE COURT IS GOING TO INTERPRET THE TREATIES IN LIGHT OF THE AGREEMENTS THAT'S A PERFECTLY FAIR COMMENT THIS IDEA THAT IN SOME WAY THE COURT CAN IGNORE THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE AGREEMENT WHICH HAS FORCED AN INTERNATIONAL LAW BETWEEN THE PARTIES
IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE TREATERS THEMSELVES BUT ONLY IF YOU IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE AND WE EXPECT A SITUATION WHERE FOR EXAMPLE A POLISH UNION MADE CHALLENGE SOME OF THESE CHANGES WHICH AT THE COURT AND THE COURT LOOKS AS IT HAS TWO GOES TO THE TREATIES AND IN THE TREATIES IT HAS NO DISCRIMINATION AND YET IT TAKES ACCOUNT OF WHAT WAS AGREED IN THIS DEAL IT COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WELL I'M AFRAID THE TREATY TRUMPS WHAT WAS AGREED LAST WEEK
IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT AN INTERPRETATION OF THE TREATY MAY TURN OUT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE UNITED KINGDOM MAY ARGUE ALL INTERNATIONAL TREATIES WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED BY THIRD PARTIES HAVE THAT RISK WE'VE SIGNED UP TO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY QUITE APART FROM THE E.U. TREATY THAT IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S A POSSIBILITY SO SHOULDN'T TAKE US INTO THE REALM OF THE FANCIFUL
IT IS FANCIFUL TO SAY THAT THE TREATY THAT THE AGREEMENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ARRIVED AT DOES NOT HAVE A FORCE IN LAW THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT AND ON THE FACE OF IT BECAUSE IT IS IN SOME AREAS SO CLEAR ABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM SPECIAL STATUS ONE WITH THEREFORE EXPECT THE COURT
TO ACCEPT THAT STATUS IN AN ARGUMENT WHICH WAS TAKING PLACE FOR EXAMPLE WITH A POLISH UNION ON DISCRIMINATION THEY CAN'T JUST IGNORE IT INDEED THE PERHAPS THE REASON THAT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY DOESN'T TRUST THE EUROPEAN COURT IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CASES IN THE PAST WHERE THERE HAD BEEN AN EXPECTATION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND THEN THEY WERE COURT RULINGS WHICH SEEMED TO MANY PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF IT SURPRISE HER
YES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE NEED TO CLARIFY THE UNITED KINGDOM STATUS PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT OF OUR OPT OUTS OR OPT INS AS THEY'RE SOMETIMES CALLED IS SO IMPORTANT AND AS ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS WAS SOMETHING I HAD TO WRESTLE WITH AT FREQUENT INTERVALS AND I WASN'T ALWAYS SATISFIED WITH THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE COURT ARRIVED THAT THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT ON THE TWO KEY ISSUES OF A SPECIAL STATUS OUTSIDE OF THE EUROZONE AND EVER CLOSER UNION AND THE RED CARD THE PRIME MINISTER'S ACTUALLY ACHIEVED SOMETHING WHICH IS
I THOUGHT WELL BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS IN THE NEGOTIATION VIEWING IT AS A LAWYER AND I'M NOT SURPRISED THEREFORE THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE COMPLAINED RATHER BITTERLY THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ITSELF A RATHER EXCEPTIONAL STATUS SO YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WE HAVE THAT STATUS IT IS ENSHRINED IN THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT SOME OF IT WILL BE INCORPORATED IN FUTURE TREATIES AND IT CAN'T JUST BE MAGICKED AWAY BY SAYING WELL
IT'S OF NO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE COURT CAN IGNORE IT TO THE COURT CANNOT IGNORE IT WOULD REMAIN A CREDIBLE CAUGHT YOU LEFT THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF YOUR OPPOSITION TO PLANNED CHANGES TOO NOT LEAST THE BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS THE PROPOSED BRITISH BIT OF RIGHTS WE FIND OURSELVES HERE JUST A FEW DAYS INTO THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY IS ON A MATTER OF LAW CONTRADICTING THE PRIME MINISTER
IT'S A VERY STRANGE SITUATION TO SAY THE LEAST DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS TENABLE ALL I CAN SAY I DON'T I CAN'T COMMENT AS TO WHY MICHAEL GO FOR THE MAID SAID WHAT IT DOES I SUGGEST THAT MICHAEL GO SHOULD CONSULT HIS OWN DEPARTMENTAL LAWYERS WHO I THINK WOULD BE ABLE TO ENLIGHTEN HIM AS TO THE STATUS OF THE AGREEMENTS AS FOR THE QUESTION ABOUT THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SENSIBLE DISCUSSION WHICH MEANS THAT THINGS CAN'T ALWAYS BE VIEWED IN BLACK AND WHITE
THIS APPLIES ON BOTH SIDES AS I'VE TRIED TO ATTEMPT TO DO FOR YOU THIS MORNING WE NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLE AND RATIONAL DEBATE BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO HELP THAT RATIONAL DEBATE TO SAY THAT IN FACT THE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ARRIVED AT WHICH WILL BECOME A FORCE OF LAW IF WE DECIDE TO STAY IN CAN SIMPLY BE IGNORED IT'S JUST NOT THE CASE
DOMINIC GRIEVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE THREE YEARS AGO LONDONDERRY WAS DESIGNATED AS THE FIRST U.K. CITY OF CULTURE NEXT YEAR HULL WILL BECOME THE SECOND AROUND HALF A DOZEN OTHER CITIES AND TOWNS ARE NOW IN THE RUNNING TO BE THE THIRD TAKING OVER FROM HOLLAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE
THE IDEA IS TO USE CULTURE TO HELP KICK START REGENERATION AS WELL AS SHOWCASE LOCAL ARTISTS IN THE FIRST OF A SERIES PROFILING THE CONTENDERS NICK HYAM HAS BEEN TO PAISLEY SOUTH WEST OF GLASGOW AND HOME OF THE FAMOUS PAISLEY PATTERN TEXTILES
CITY OF CULTURE SURELY NOT I HEAR YOU SCOFF IT'S NOT A CITY FOR A START IT HAS PRECIOUS LITTLE CULTURE AND FRANKLY IT'S A BIT OF A DUMP JUST LISTEN TO THIS LOCAL MAN DO YOU COME FROM
RESPECTABLE WE'RE HERE BECAUSE PEGGY WANTS TO BE THE CITY OF CULTURE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWO THOUSAND
I'M DEADLY SERIOUS BUT LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER IN A CONVERTED CHURCH JUST OFF PAISLEY HIGH STREET YOU'LL FIND ONE OF BRITAIN'S LARGEST YOUTH DRAMA GROUPS
PEOPLE TO COME AND STAND UP HERE IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE O.K. AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO SAY DON THEIR CHARACTER IT WAS FOUNDED ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO BY DAVID WALLIS PITS WERE SET UP BY A BRAT PERFORM MANY MANY MANY YEARS MOST OF IT
COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED PEOPLE COME TO PAISLEY GENUINELY COME TO PIERS LINSEY WOW WE DIDN'T REALISE PEAS WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL TIME FOR STYLE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO TO SHOW A BIT THAT I THINK PERHAPS PIERS WOULD BUY THESE I'VE BEEN SMALL TO STAND UP AND BE PROUD OF WHAT THEY HAVE
BUDDIES IS WHAT PAISLEY PEOPLE CALL THEMSELVES AND DAVID WALLIS BELIEVES BIDDING TO BE CITY OF CULTURE NEVER MIND ACTUALLY WINNING WILL HELP TRANSFORM THE WAY OUTSIDERS AND LOCALS ALIKE THINK OF THE TERM THE LOCAL COUNCIL'S HERE MARK MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION POUNDS TO HELP THE PROCESS ALONG
THE PAISLEY PATTERN AND THE TOWN'S HISTORY AS ONE OF EUROPE'S LEADING TEXTILE CENTRES ARE EXPOSED ARGUMENT THE CITY OF CULTURE STATUS
DOCTOR DAN COGHLAN TRAINED AS A HANDLOOM WEAVER HE CAN STILL OPERATE THE EIGHTEENTH OR NINETEENTH CENTURY LOOMS IN THE PAISLEY MUSEUM'S COLLECTION NOW HE'S THE CURATOR OF TEXTILES
UNLOCKED HIS FIREPROOF SAFE TO SHOW ME SOME OF HIS TWELVE HUNDRED PAISLEY SHAWLS AND NINETEENTH CENTURY BOOKS FULL OF DISTINCTIVE PAISLEY PATTERN DESIGNS BASED ON KASHMIRI ORIGINALS AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE ARE VERY VERY
COMPLEX DESIGNS AND THEY ALL HAVE THIS VERY TYPICAL CAN YOU DROP IT I THINK
DROP TO THE LANGUAGE EVERYONE KNOWS OF THE PISTE
MUCH OF THE COUNCIL'S INVESTMENT WILL GO TOWARDS TRANSFORMING THE MUSEUM WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND THE MUSEUM AND BUILD WHAT A WEAVING STUDIO OR A TEXAN STUDIO WHICH WILL TELL THE STORY IN FAR GREATER DEPTH AND HAS BEEN TOLD BEFORE AND THE SOCIAL HISTORY WHICH GOES WITH HER AS WELL BUT PAISLEY HAS SOME OF THE MOST DEPRIVED NEIGHBOURHOODS IN SCOTLAND
AINSLEY HAS PLENTY OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS NINETEENTH CENTURY TOWN HALL IS ESPECIALLY ELEGANT AND JUST ACROSS THE ROAD THAT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE WAR MEMORIAL WITH A CRUSADER KNIGHT FLANKED BY FOUR WORLD WAR ONE TOMMY'S
BUT THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HIGH STREET AS YOU WALK UP YOU GET SOME IDEA OF THE CHALLENGES THE TOWN FACES THE HIGH STREET IS FULL OF EMPTY SHOP FRONTS AND THERE ARE VERY FEW
THE CITY OF CULTURE BID IS ONE WAY TO ENCOURAGE INWARD INVESTMENT AND REGENERATION
THERE'S TWO
LIVES FOR OUR JOURNEY
CHICK O'CONNORS AN ENTHUSIAST FOR THE BEARD HE'S A SINGER SONGWRITER WHO HELPED FOUND THE PAISLEY SONGWRITERS' GUILD
WHAT'S A COMMITTED SCOTTISH NATIONALIST DOING SUPPORTING AN EXPLICITLY U.K. INITIATIVE
AS YOU SEE I'M NATIONALISTS AND PIERCE THEM OUR WISHES WOULD BE THAT WE COULD BE AN INDEPENDENT NATION AND IT'S REALLY THRILLING WHO WON IN THE AFTERBURNER ENOUGH EARS BUT WAS THERE WHEN THE MARRIAGE THEN YOU MAKE THE BEST BY THE MARRIAGE OF THE U.K.
SO PAISLEY HAS A VIBRANT CULTURAL SCENE AND PLENTY OF HERITAGE WHAT HE'D SO FAR WORKS ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY FIRST TRIP TO THE TOWER IS MUCH IN THE WAY OF RESTAURANTS FOR CITY OF CULTURE VISITORS TO IN
AND THINKING OF YOURSELF NICK HIGHAM THEY'RE REPORTING AT SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE AND ASTON MARTIN AS A NEW CAR NEW FACTORY IN WALES YEAH ASTON MARTIN HAS ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING TO BUILD A NEW CAR CALLED THE D. B. X. FOR JUST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND IN SAINT ATHENS IN WALES WEALTH WAS UP AGAINST SEVERAL SITES
AROUND THE WORLD TO APPEN ONE ANDREW PALMER IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND JOINED US ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU AT ONE STAGE DURING THAT WHEREAS YOU WERE CASTING AROUND FOR A PLACE YOU DESCRIBE ALABAMA AS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE WHY DID YOU SETTLE ON SAINT ATHENS WELL WE NEED A LOT OF DUE DILIGENCE WE DID ALMOST A YEAR OF LOOKING AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD TWENTY IN FACT WE ARE IN THERE IF YOU WILL

WELL OBVIOUSLY WELLS IT ROUND CARDIFF IS AN ASSISTED AREA AND THERE ARE THERE ARE GRANT AID AVAILABLE ARE AS THEY ARE TOO MANY BUSINESSES AND CERTAINLY IT'S A FACTOR WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WALES BY FAR WASN'T THAT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FROM UP FROM A PURE GRAN TAKE POINT OF VIEW WHAT WAS WHAT WAS MUCH MORE INTERESTING WAS THE ABILITY TO BRING THE CAR IN ON TIME AND THE QUALITY OF THE WORKFORCE I WOULD SAY THE PASSION OF THE
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BRINGING ASTON MARTIN TO WALES TO WHAT EXTENT IF ANY DID THE LOOMING REFERENDUM AFFECT YOUR THINKING HELP HAD A THAT GO TO THE PROCESS NOT AT ALL TO BE TO BE FRANK I DON'T THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE SELECTION BASED ON HYPOTHESES ARE WHAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAPPEN AND OUR ONLY DESIRE WI A MEMBER PERSONALLY I THINK THERE'S IT'S DOWN TO THE BRITISH PUBLIC TO DECIDE WHETHER WE STAY IN OR GO FRIGHTEN COME OUT OF THE E.U.
AND BASICALLY I WOULD WISH AND I GUESS WHAT BUSINESSES WOULD WISHES THAT WE MAINTAIN FREE TRADE AND THAT WE HAVE A STABLE ECONOMY YOU'VE HAD A FEW ROUGH YEARS AFTER THE CRISIS OR DESPITE A WORLDWIDE BOOM IN LUXURY CARS YOU ALSO BORROWING MONEY QUITE HIGH INTEREST RATES WERE OR WHY YOU'VE STRUGGLED WHEN EVERYONE ELSE ALL THE OTHER LUXURY COMIC OR SEEMS TO HAVE DONE WELL AND WHETHER YOU CAN SURVIVE AS AN INDEPENDENT
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WERE INDEPENDENT COMPANY AND WE DON'T HAVE THE HUGE RESOURCES OF A B.M.W. OR A V.W. BEHIND US WE HAVE TO STAND ON TWO LEGS WE'VE WE MANAGED TO RIGHT RAISE THE FINANCES TO NOT ONLY REPLACE THE D. B. NINE I ANNOUNCED THE D.B. ELEVEN IN GENEVA NEXT WEEK BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'VE GOT A CAR'S COMING AFTER THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE LAUNCHING A NEW A NEW CAR EVERY

MADE IN WALES ALL RIGHT ANDREW PALMER CHIEF EXEC TO ASTON MARTIN THANK YOU SO MUCH ONE THINK YOU HELP HIM HE'S A CHEAP POUND IT IS DOWN BY ONE ONE THIRTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE JUPITER'S BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE
SIMON THANK YOU THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE FATHER OF TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD RYAN MEYERS WHO TOOK HIS OWN LIFE AFTER GETTING INTO DEBT BECAUSE OF HIS GAMBLING ADDICTION HAS CALLED FOR STRICTER CONTROLS ON FIXED ODDS BETTING TERMINALS THE MACHINE'S FOUND IN BETTING SHOPS ACROSS THE U.K.
THEY ALLOW A MAXIMUM POSSIBLE STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS ON A SINGLE BET AND THE GAMBLING COMMISSION SAYS MORE THAN A BILLION AND A HALF POUNDS WAS LOST BY GAMBLERS ON THESE MACHINES IN THE YEAR UP TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM MERSEYSIDE BY RYAN'S FATHER JOHN MYERS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DO YOU KNOW HOW RYAN BECAME ADDICTED TO THESE MACHINES WE DIDN'T EVEN RHYME WAS ADDICTED TO BE WE ONLY FOUND OUT AFTER
HE HAD HER KILLED HIMSELF WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY IT DONNA WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY COS HE WAS A HAPPY GO LUCKY LAD ALWAYS LAUGHING AND JOKING AND IT'S ONLY WHEN WE LOOKED INTO THINGS THAT WE FOUND OUT HE'D ACTUALLY BEEN GAMBLING AND HOW MUCH DID HE LOSE
APPEARED AT THE TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF APPEARED AT A TIME AND WE KNOW THAT HE HAD THERE ALONE OUT WITH BANK AND HE ALSO HAD TO HAVE ONE OF THESE PAYDAY LOANS AS WELL
AND SO HE HAD HE HAD RACKED UP THAT THE DEBTS AND IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS SPENT AND LOST ON THESE ON THESE MACHINES EVERY YEAR WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HER
OFFERED IT TO START OFF BUT BUT WE NEED TO GET THE LIMIT DOWN I MEAN ONE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR WHAT IS A FEW SECOND SPIN AND IT COULD BE GONE IN SECONDS YOU KNOW BUT WITHIN AN HOUR YOU TALK ABOUT LOSING MAYBE HUNDREDS MAYBE THOUSANDS OF POUNDS JUST
SITTING ON A MACHINE JUST PUT MONEY IN TO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE MAXIMUM TO BE DO YOU THINK WHAT WOULD BE THIS THEIR WELL SAFE OR ACCEPTABLE LEVEL TO YOU
DOWN THE MERSEY BUT TOM JUST ON ONE IN THE RIVER MERSEY BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HIM AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE
SOMEWHERE AROUND ABOUT THIRTY TO FIFTY POUNDS BUT WITH MOST AS AS A MAXIM THAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT'S BROUGHT IN STRONGER CONTROLS ON THESE MACHINE SO FOR EXAMPLE ANYONE WANTING TO PLACE A STAKE OVER FIFTY HAS TO INTERACT WITH STAFF IN THE SHOP
DOES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED YOU'VE GOT STUFF IN THE SHOP ARE GOING TO BE BUSY ANYWAY TAKEN ALL THE BETS DOING OTHER THINGS AND PEOPLE HAVE COME IN
WHO'S GOING TO CHECK THAT WE CAN AFFORD IT NO BUT IT IS JUST GONNA LOOK AT HIM AND SAY MAKE A CHOICE O.K. YOU CAN CARRY ON DOING IT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT PERSON
THEY ARE NOT INFORMED ENOUGH TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT PERSON CAN AFFORD TO KEEP PUT MONEY IN THAT MACHINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM BANNED
COMPLETELY YEAH RICH THEY'VE JUST TAKEN OUT ENTIRELY TAKEN OUT IN TYLER YOU THINK THEY'RE THAT DANGEROUS I'VE BECOME THE CRACK COCAINE OF THE BETHAN INDUSTRY
AND THEY DO YOU DO YOU HOLD THESE MACHINES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR SON I HOLD HIS MACHINE BUT I ALSO OLD DIRECTOR YOUR WHOLE GAMBLE INDUSTRY I THINK YOU'VE GOT THINGS LIKE ONLINE GAMBLING WHICH IS THE SILENT ONE YOU CAN BE IN A PUBLIC HOUSE FULL OF PEOPLE
YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE PERSON WHO DRINKS A LOT YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE PERSON WHO TAKES DRUGS BUT THE MAN MAKANA SITTING THERE QUIETLY ON HIS PHONE YOU DON'T REALISE THAT
HE'S BETTING OLLIE HE'S LIFE AWAY NOBODY CAN SEE YOU ONLINE GAMBLING IS IS JUST AS BAD BECAUSE
YOU CAN SEE IT EVEN IF YOU LOSE MONEY BUT ON ONE SITE YOU CAN GO TO ANOTHER SITE THAT GIVE YOU FREE BETS EXCEPT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU TO DO MORE AND MORE
SO I THINK THAT'S JUST AS BAD AND THE ADVERTS ON T.V. AND EVERYWHERE IS JUST TERRIBLE JOHN MAYA'S FATHER OF RYAN MYERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE

THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO NINE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE NOW SIGNED A PETITION CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO WIDEN THE MENINGITIS VACCINATION PROGRAMME SO IT REACHES MORE CHILDREN THE CAMPAIGN SNOWBALLED AFTER THE RELEASE OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF CHILDREN VERY ILL WITH OR DYING FROM THE VIRUS
A PHOTO SHOWS LITTLE FAY IN HER FINAL DAYS HER PARENTS HAVE CHOSEN TO RELEASE IT TERENCE RELEASED A SHOCKING PICTURE WIDELY CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWING HER BODY CONSUMED BY A TERRIBLE RASH SHORTLY BEFORE DIAGNOSED IT SAYS HIS PARENTS FROM WALSALL HOPE THERE BY RELEASING AN IMAGE OF THEM CRADLING HIM IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS THEY CAN RAISE AWARENESS OF THE VACCINE CAMPAIGN
SO HOW SHOULD NEWS ORGANISATIONS HANDLE THESE SORTS OF IMAGES WERE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY SOPHIE BATTERY HAD A PICTURES AT INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERS AND FROM CHELMSFORD BY ALAN SPARROW CHAIR OF THE U.K. PICTURE EDITORS GUILD GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING CHEF GOOD MORNING SOPHIE HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT ARE THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THAT YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
HOLY FAMILY CONSENT IF A PICTURE BEING PUT OUT BY THE FAMILY GIVES IT A MUCH MORE REAL AND NICK FEELS LESS INTRUSIVE PERHAPS THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT IT DOES FEEL LESS INTRUSIVE AND THE FAMILY DEFINITELY WANT THE STORY TO BE TOLD BUT ALSO HOW SHOCKING IT IS WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN READERS AWAY FROM THE STORY OR TOWARDS THE STORY WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS A JOB AND EVERYTHING IS TO BRING A READER TOWARDS A STORY RATHER THAN AWAY FROM YES YOU WANT TO SELL THE NEWSPAPER
PARTLY THAT AND ALSO PEOPLE TO READ IT IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SALES BUT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE UPSET OR TURNED AWAY BY SOMETHING THERE'S THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SHOCK THAT YOU'RE AFTER EXACTLY ALAN SPARROW I WHAT IF IT'S CHANGED OVER TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE A PICTURE EDITOR OF THE GUARDIAN AND THE METRO FOR MANY MANY YEARS DO YOU THINK WE ARE LESS SHOCKABLE TODAY THAN WE WERE
I THINK THAT WE ARE LESS SHOCKABLE BECAUSE THE BAR IS BEEN ALTERED NOT BY A PROFESSIONAL PICTURES PEOPLE BUT BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY'RE ALTERING THE BAR I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE BRINGING IT LOWER BUT THEY ARE ALTERING THE LEVEL AT WHICH PEOPLE APPROACH HER EXCEPT IN THESE IMAGES SO SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOW
THE GOVERNOR OF WHAT WE DECIDE TO SEE IF IT'S ON THE TWITTER OR IT'S ON FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM ARE WE
PICTURE PROFESSIONALS IN NEWSPAPERS AND BROADCASTERS GOING TO SAY WE CAN'T USE THIS BECAUSE IT MIGHT SHOCK IT'S ALREADY OUT THERE WAS THERE A PICTURE IN YOUR TIME BUT YOU AGONISED OVER WHICH YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW TODAY WE WOULD WE WOULD POSSIBLY NOT EVEN
LINK THAT I THINK THAT THE ATTITUDE AND HERE HE'S BEEN VERY MUCH AGAINST SHOWING DEAD BODIES WHICH HAVING TO TURN THIS TERMINIX BROKE EXPLOSIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE MIND AND INJURED I THINK GOOD SENSE PREVAILS
IN MANY WAYS WITH THAT DON'T WE RESIST SHOWING THOSE SORT OF SHOCKING IMAGES FOR JUST FOR SENSATIONALISM OF COURSE ATTITUDES IN THE EAST IN FAR EAST ARE MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE THEY ARE MORE PREPARED TO PHOTOGRAPH HER AND USE THOSE IMAGES AND YET BUT HERE WE DON'T KNOW AND I'M GLAD OF THAT AND YOU THREW UP
TROUBLE WAS IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH THE APARTHEID AND THE NECKLACE IN AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU USE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO USE THOSE SORT OF THINGS SO IF YOU FOR YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IT WAS WHERE THE PICTURES COME FROM IN THE CASE OF OF THESE CHILDREN SOME OF WHOM LATER DIED FROM FROM MENINGITIS THAT THE PICTURES WERE PUT FORWARD BY BY THEIR PARENTS
YOU COULD STILL HAVE QUALMS COULD YOU NOT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THAT MINOR WHO WAS BEING PHOTOGRAPHED ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S ALWAYS AN AGONISING DECISION AS TO WHETHER IT'S RIGHT TO PUBLISH OR NOT IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK THE STORY'S OVERWHELMINGLY TOWARDS GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT THEM TO MAKE PARENTS AWARE AND GET THE PETITION SIGNED IN OTHER INSTANCES AS LESS OF A DRIVE TO PUBLISHED THOSE PICTURES SO YOU ARE THEREFORE CONTRIBUTING TO IT IN'T ESSENTIALLY BY PUBLISHING DO YOU REGARD THAT AS ENDORSING A CAMPAIGN
ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING LIKE THIS I MEAN WHATEVER WE DO WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OPINION
WHETHER NEGATIVELY OR POSITIVE MATE A BIT WHERE WHERE A CAMPAIGN AND THIS ONE YOU COULD SAY IS LEADING TO A VERY EMOTIONAL REACTION ABOUT THAT MAY INFLUENCE DECISION MAKING AWAY FROM A PURELY PURELY LOGIC BASED APPROACH WOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUALMS ABOUT THAT
A LITTLE BIT I MEAN THOUGHT IS GIVEN TO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WE IN PARTICULAR PERHAPS NOT USED THOSE IMAGES PARTICULARLY LARGE BECAUSE ALSO PLACEMENT PAYS A BIG BIG PART IN THIS IF WE WERE DOING THE STORY QUITE BIG WE MIGHT WELL USE A PICTURE OF THE CHILD IN HAPPIER TIMES
ON THE FRONT AND THEN HAVE A MORE DISTRESSING PICTURE INSIDE AND ALL OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED HEAVILY ALAN'S AS A PICTURE EDITORS TODAY TODAY'S ACTUALLY HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER WHAT GIVEN FACT THE SONY PICTURES ARE TAKEN BY PEOPLE THEMSELVES AND PUBLISH ON SOCIAL MEDIA
CONTROL IS AN INTERESTING WORD I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO REFLECT WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTED TO SEE WHAT HE SAYS IF IF THIS PICTURE IS PUT OUT BY THE FAMILY WITH A DEFINITE RESULT WHAT TO HIS MIND AND I THINK KIDS MAKES ALL I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALAN SPARROW SOPHIE BATTERY THANK YOU BOTH THAT'S IT OUR EDITORS ADAM COME AND SKIN JONATHAN HARVEY GOOD MORNING
