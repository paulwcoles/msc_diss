FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A FEW SHOWERS AROUND THIS MORNING OTHERWISE WE'RE LOOKING AT A PRETTY DECENT DAY WITH SUNNY SPELLS AND A FEW SHOWERS BREAKING OUT AT TIMES SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS WILL BE THE HIGH AND THEN TOMORROW APART FROM NORTHERN IRELAND AND WESTERN SCOTLAND WHICH WILL REMAIN BREEZY WITH A FEW SHOWERS THE REST OF THE U.K. WITH A FINE AND SETTLED DAY WITH GOOD LONG SUNNY SPELLS MAKING FEEL PLEASANTLY WARM STUFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE LEAD FOR THE TIMES
WITH THE HEADLINE BRICKS AT CAMP DIVIDED A SENIOR TORY WALKS OUT OF THIS IS BARONESS FARSI SIDE OF ARSEY WHO IS SWITCHING SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN NOW SUPPORTING REMAIN RATHER THAN LEAVE THE TIME SAYS BARONESS WELL SEE THE FORMER COMMUNITIES MINISTER WHO CO CHAIRED THE TORY PARTY ACCUSED MICHAEL GO THE JUSTICE SECRETARY AND BRECHT'S IT CAMPAIGN OF PEDDLING COMPLETE LIES AND SHE SAID THAT THE FINAL STRAW FOR HER WAS HERE IN NIGEL FARAGE THE UKIP LEADER DEFEND A POSTER WITH THE SLOGAN BREAKING POINT DEPICTING A LINE OF REFUGEES
TRUDGING ACROSS A EUROPE SHE TOLD THE TIMES THAT BREAKING POINT POSTER REALLY WAS FOR ME THE BREAKING POINT TO SAY I CAN'T GO ON SUPPORTING THIS ARE WE PREPARED TO TELL LIES TO SPREAD HATE AND XENOPHOBIA JUST TO WIN A CAMPAIGN FOR ME THAT'S A STEP TOO FAR WILL BE TALKING TO HER LATER IN THE PROGRAMME YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE PAPERS THAT WANTED TO VOTE LEAVE DO NOT HIGH LIKE THAT ON THE FRONT PAGE INSTEAD THEY DO HIGHLIGHT TO T. V. APPEARANCES YESTERDAY THE SUN'S HEADLINE
WE CAN'T KEEP THEM OUT Y. YOU CAMP IMPOSSIBLE IF REMAIN WINDS IS THE SUB HEADLINE THAT'S HIGHLIGHTING WHAT JEREMY CORBIN SAID TO ANDREW MARR YESTERDAY ON HIS T.V. SHOW IN WHICH HE SAID THERE COULD BE NO LIMIT TO IMMIGRATION THE MALE INSTEAD FOCUSING ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S APPEARANCE ON QUESTION TIME SPECIAL DAVID DIMBLEBY
P.M.'S TEE VEE MORNING OVER MIGRATION IS HOW MALE PUTS IT IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH CHOOSES TO HIGHLIGHT ITS OWN COLUMNIST BORIS JOHNSON MORE OPTIMISTIC HEADLINE OR BORIS VOTE LEAVE CHANGE HISTORY CLUTTERS PARLIAMENT IS BEING RECALLED TODAY TO REMEMBER JOE COX THE LATE LABOUR M.P. AND THE FRONT PAGE PICTURE IN THE GARDENERS IS OF THE YORKSHIRE VIKINGS CRICKET TEAM PAUSING YESTERDAY TO OBSERVE A MINUTE'S SILENCE
IN HER MEMORY IT'S ALSO THE FRONT PAGES THAT IS A STORY ABOUT THE JOKE COX FUND RAISING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS IN IN THE TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS SET UP JUST LOOKING AT THE FUN NOW IT'S RAISED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND SINCE THE GUARDIAN WROTE THAT THE MONEY WILL GO TO THREE OF HER FAVOURITE CHARITIES THE ROYAL VOLUNTARY SERVICE HOPE NOT HATE AND THE WHITE HELMETS ARE VOLUNTEER SEARCH AND RESCUE WORKERS
IT IS TEN PAST SIX MORE NOW ON THAT TELEVISION APPEARANCE BY DAVID CAMERON YESTERDAY MUST DO BETTER THAT WAS HOW HE MARKED HIS OWN REFERENDUM HOMEWORK WHEN HE APPEARED FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A BIG TELEVISION APPEARANCE BEFORE THE VOTE ON THURSDAY IT WAS A SPECIAL EDITION OF QUESTION TIME AND IT DAVID CAMERON ADMITTED HE HAD TO DO MORE TO GET HIS ARGUMENTS ACROSS THE FACE QUESTIONS FROM AN AUDIENCE IN MILTON KEYNES
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WARN THEM THAT IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. IT WOULD BE FOREVER THERE WOULD BE NO SECOND CHANCE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND AND AGAIN AND AGAIN HE URGED VOTERS TO IGNORE THOSE WHO ARE TELLING THEM TO IGNORE THE EXPERTS
THE BELIEVE CAMPAIGN SAY LET'S NOT LISTEN TO EXPERTS BUT IF WE'RE ABOUT TO GET INTO A CAR AND DRIVE OUR CHILDREN ON A MOTORWAY AND THE MECHANIC SAYS THE BRAKES DON'T WORK
THE PETROL GAUGE IS FAULTY THE STEERING ISN'T WORKING WE WOULDN'T GET IN THE CAR AND I SAY WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS BECAUSE THEY'RE GIVING US A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE ABOUT THE RISK TO THE ECONOMY THE WRIST OF THE JOBS AND THE REST OF THE LIVELIHOODS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO VOTE
THE REAL STARS OF THESE PROGRAMMES ARE OF COURSE THOSE ASKING THE QUESTIONS ONCE AGAIN THEY COME PREPARED TO MAKE LIFE AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE FOR THE MAN WHO YOU MAY RECALL CAME TO GET HIS PARTY'S LEADERSHIP BY TELLING THE CONSERVATIVES TO STOP OBSESSING ABOUT EUROPE THE ISSUE THAT OBSESSES MANY OF THOSE WHO WANT OUT OF COURSE IS THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION
YOU SAY THAT YOUR POLICY THAT YOU'VE NEGOTIATE WITH EUROPE CANNOT BE OVERHAULED IT KAREN SO ARE YOU REALLY THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN WAVING A PIECE OF PAPER
IT'S QUITE A DICTATORSHIP IN EUROPE CAN OVER WOOLRIDGE
HE WASN'T GOING TO GET A SIMPLE YES OR NO ANSWER THE CHARGE WAS IN EFFECT OF TREACHERY AND IT APPEARED TO FLIP A PRIME MINISTERIAL SWITCH WAS THIS ANGER WAS IT PRE SCRIPTED PASSION WAS IT PERHAPS A LITTLE OF BOTH
MY OFFICE I SEE TWO YARDS AWAY FROM THE CABINET ROOM WHERE WINSTON CHURCHILL DECIDED TO MAY NINETEEN FORTY TO FIGHT ON AGAINST THE BEST AND GREATEST DECISION THAT ANYONE'S EVER MADE IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE ALONE
YOU WANT TO BE FIGHTING WITH HER FRIENDSHIP WITH THE POLES AND THE OTHERS BUT HE DIDN'T QUIT HE DIDN'T QUIT ON EUROPE YOU DIDN'T QUIT ON EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY YOU DIDN'T QUIT ON EUROPEAN FREEDOM WE WANT TO FIGHT FOR THOSE THINGS TODAY AND YOU CAN'T WIN YOU CAN'T FIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE ROOM ALL RIGHT CAN'T WHEN I'VE GOT THEM
IF DIRECT CONFRONTATION HAD NOT UNSETTLE THE PRIME MINISTER A DIRECT QUESTION ASKED REPEATEDLY SEEM TO DISTIL THE FEARS THAT MILLIONS OF TURKS MIGHT FOLLOW THE POLES THE ROMANIANS THE BULGARIANS AND OTHERS INTO BRITAIN WOULD HE PROMISED A VETO TURKISH MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U.
IF THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT IT BUT THERE'S NOT GOING TO THIS IS ABOUT THIRTY FORTY YEARS TIME AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE PRIME MINISTER IN THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS TIME IT IS A RED HERRING AS I SAY IF PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DECIDED TO VOTE ME
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A CHOICE IT'S A REFERENDUM BUT TO DO IT ON THE BASIS OF TURKEY JOINING THE E.U. YOU'D BE VOTING TO LEAVE AN ORGANISATION TO DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY ON THE BASIS OF SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN O.K. THAT WILL BE A CRAZY THING WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT THIS STAGE WHEN THE E.U. IS TALKING ABOUT ACCELERATING THE PROCESS OF ACCESSION I KNOW YOU SAID I JUST WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW I TO LET ME EXPLAIN ON THE DISCUSSION NO MORE TALK NO IT'S RENOIR
HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY FAVOURABLE TO TURKEY WE WANT TURKEY TO BE WESTERN LEANING COUNTRY WANTED TO BE A DEMOCRACY WE WANT IT TO HAVE HAVE A RULE OF LAW WE DON'T WANT IT TO IMPRISON JOURNALIST FRANKLY THIS IS NOT GOING VERY WELL AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN POSITIVE TO TURKEY BUT LET ME SAY AGAIN THE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM ON THE BASIS OF TURKEY JOINING BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
IF A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON THURSDAY IT WILL OF COURSE NOT BE THE PRIME MINISTER BUT THE HISTORIANS WHO WILL BE MARKING HIS HOMEWORK AND THEY MAY MARK HIM DOWN AS THE MAN WHO TOOK BRITAIN OUT OF EUROPE BY MISTAKE
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX TO HOME NATIONS TAKE TO THE PITCH IN EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN TODAY WALES VERSES RUSSIA AND ENGLAND VERSUS SLOVAKIA OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE JOINS US NOW FROM SANTA I.T.N. AND MATTHEW THAT'S WHERE THE ENGLAND GAME WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY WHAT ARE ENGLAND'S CHANCES LOOKING LIKE
WELL THEY SHOULD BEAT SLOVAKIA I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IF THEY DO THAT
THEN THEY WIN THE GROUP WHICH MEANS THAT THEY STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF MOVING THROUGH TO A DECENT TEAM IN THE LAST SIXTEEN THEY'LL THEY'LL QUALIFY ALSO WITH A DRAW IF THEY LOSE AGAINST SLOVAKIA THEN IT STARTS TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE TRICKY BUT STILL NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH SO WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING THROUGH AFTER TONIGHT
PRETTY GOOD AND WHAT IS IT LIKE IN SANTA IN TERMS OF SECURITY AND ARE GIVEN THE TROUBLE THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN FROM RIGHT FROM THE START OF THIS TOURNAMENT
MICHELLE IT'S A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FROM MARSEILLE AND INDEED FROM LILLE ALTHOUGH LOANS WHERE THE ENGLAND TEAM PLAYED THEIR LAST GAME WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LESS CONFRONTATIONAL THAN LEO I MEAN YESTERDAY IT WAS FOOTBALL AND THE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
AS IT SHOULD BE A GOOD AMOUNT OF DRINKING FROM A LARGE AMOUNT OF FANS ENGLAND FANS TOOK OVER THE MAIN SQUARE HERE
HUGE ENGLAND FACT FLAGS FROM EVERY TREE AND EVERY BUILDING THEY COULD FIND THEY DANCED ALONG TO SONGS BEING PLAYED BY A D.J. I SAW A COUPLE OF FRIENDS WALK UP TO A COUPLE OF FRENCH POLICE AND TO GET THEIR PHOTOS TAKEN WITH THAT HIT US A SELFIE WITH THE FRENCH POLICE
I CAN TELL YOU I DID NOT SEE THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOUR IN MARSEILLES ON THE FRENCH SIDE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE FROM THE POLICE AS WELL IN MARSEILLE IN LEGAL IT WAS A SUGGESTION THAT THE RIOT POLICE WERE STANDING TOO CLOSE TO THE FENCE THAT THEY ALMOST PROVIDED A TARGET FOR THEM HERE THEY WERE STANDING WELL BACK THE RIOT VANS WERE A LONG LONG WAY AWAY FROM WHERE THE FANS WERE CONGREGATING
THE POLICE THEMSELVES DIDN'T HAVE THEIR RIOT SHIELDS UP THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR HELMETS ON THEY WERE WANDERING AMONGST THE CROWD IN A MUCH MORE RELAXED FASHION BEER WASN'T BEING SOLD IN BOTTLES IT WAS BEING SOLD OPENLY IN PLASTIC
CONTAINERS AND SO ALL OF THOSE FACTORS I THINK ADDED IN TOGETHER TO MEAN IT WAS A FAR MORE JOVIAL ATMOSPHERE THAN HAS BEEN SEEN SO FAR WITH ENGLAND FANS AND I FAR LESS CONFRONTATIONAL ATMOSPHERE AND ONE THING TO ADD IN THERE WEREN'T ANY RUSSIAN FANS AROUND SLOVAKS WERE WANDERING UP TO THE ENGLISH PUTTING THEIR ARMS ROUND THEM AND THEY WERE ALL HAVING A JOLLY GOOD OLD SING
NICE TO HEAR IT AND MATTHEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATTHEW PRICE AND SUNTAN TIAN SIX SIXTEEN WITH THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE THAT REFERENDUM BUSINESS LEADERS ARE LINING UP TO TELL US WHICH SIDE OF THE REFERENDUM THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE WIN WITH E.D.F. AND DIAGEO COMING OUT THIS MORNING FOR REMAIN JENNY BECKETT IS HERE WITH THAT AND ALL OF THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS
A GOOD MORNING TO YOU NICK THANKS YES WELL HERE'S A GROUP THAT IS REITERATING IT STANCE SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS BACK REMAINING WITHIN THE E.U. THE ORGANISATION HAS TODAY AND THAT'S THE SAME AS WHEN IT FIRST PUBLISHED THE DATE IN MARCH WHY DO THEY NEED TO REMIND US DOWN THE LINE NOW IS S. M. M. T. CHIEF EXECUTIVE MIKE WHORES MIKE WERE AT RISK OF DOUBLE COUNTING HERE
IT'S DOUBLE COUNTING WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS CLEARLY THE POLES ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DEVOTE UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME PERHAPS MISREPRESENTATION BUT WE'RE VERY CLEAR THE OUGHT U.K. AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING WELL YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION WOULD YOU LIKE WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT IF WE LEFT
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUT YOU HAVEN'T SAID TO THEM WELL IF WE DID LEAVE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SET UP MUCH MORE EASILY TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA AND INDIA AND THAT WOULD PROVE AN ADVANTAGE SO TO THAT EXTENT IT'S NOT A BALANCE QUESTION IS IT WHAT WE HAD IT WHEN HE TRADE WITH WITH CHINA WITH INDIA WITH BRAZIL BUT BY THERE MIGHT BE A REASON FOR THAT
THE DATE THEY ARE MARCUS BUT THEY'RE VOLATILE THE BIGGEST MARKET BY FIVE MEMBER EIGHTY PER CENT OF WHAT WE PRODUCE IS EXPORTED OVER HALF OF THAT GOES TO THE REST OF THE E.U. AND THE E. WAS GROWING GROWING BY SOME TWELVE PERCENT NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CAR INDUSTRY IN THAT CONTEST I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TALKING ABOUT THE CAR INDUSTRY TO LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA LIKE RUSSIA BOTH OF THOSE MARKETS IN TERMS OF U.K. EXPORTS DECLINE LAST YEAR COS THEN YOU AND THEY'RE VOLATILE BUT SOME OF YOUR MEMBERS HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
THEY WOULDN'T PICK UP AND MOVE THEIR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AFTER ALL THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND CUMBERSOME JUST THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PREFERENCE AT THE MOMENT TO STAY WITHIN THE E.U. HAS MORE THAN A PREFERENCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE INVESTMENT RAM GOES ABOUT THE AVERAGE CAR TO GET A NEW MODEL ABOUT EVERY FOUR YEARS WHICH MEANS EVERY FOUR YEARS A MANUFACTURING PLANT HAS TO GO TO HEADQUARTERS AND COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER LOCATIONS FOR THAT INVESTMENT
AND THE U.K.'S BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS IN SECURING THAT INVESTMENT WE ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PLACE IN EUROPE TO MAKE CARS LEAVING EUROPE WOULD POTENTIALLY ADD COST AND IN AN INDUSTRY WITH INCREDIBLY TIGHT MARGINS THAT WOULD MAKE IT EVER MORE DIFFICULT TO WIN THAT NEXT ROUND OF INVESTMENT BUT IN THE IMMEDIATE AND WE MIGHT SEE A DROP IN STIRLING THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF SPECULATION AROUND STIRLING AT THE MOMENT THAT WOULD PROVE ADVANTAGEOUS WOULDN'T IT
YOU COULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT EXCHANGE RATES YES IN TERMS OF EXPORT OF FINISHED GOODS ABSOLUTELY IT WOULD MAKE THEM CHEAPER BUT REMEMBER THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLEX VEHICLE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PARTS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE BROUGHT IN FROM ABROAD AROUND SIXTY PER CENT OF PARTS WE'RE TRYING TO REDRESS THAT BUT THE MAJORITY OF PARTS ARE BROUGHT IN FROM ABROAD TO YOU HAVE TO BUY THOSE PARTS IN DOLLARS AND A REDUCTION IN
THE POUND WOULD MAKE THAT MORE EXPENSIVE AND POTENTIALLY MAKE IT EQUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE TO EXPORT AS WELL THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE Y. SAY THAT IT OFTEN WORKS AGAINST ITSELF I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK WHICH OF COURSE IS AN E.U. BODY LOANED A TURKISH FORD SUBSIDIARY ONE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS OR JUST OVER TWO PERCENT I THINK IT WAS TWO POINT THREE PERCENT JUST AT A TIME THAT A SOUTHAMPTON FORD FACTORY WAS CLOSING THE TWO COINCIDED THEY MAY WELL NOT HAVE BEEN RELATED BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD
THEM THINGS LIKE THAT ARE NOT RELATED WE LOOK AT IS THE OVERALL PICTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE AND IT IS BETTER IN TERMS OF ITS BIGGEST SINGLE IT'S A BIG OUR BIGGEST MARKET AND THE SINGLE MARKET WE HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO
ALL OUR MEMBERS SAY THEY NEED PEOPLE WITH ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND VACANCIES IN THE U.K. ALMOST SACRAMENT WHICH WE CAN'T FILLED SO BIG ABLE TO MOVE PEOPLE TO TRY AND FILL THOSE GAPS IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO REMEMBER IF HE'S OUR BIGGEST MARKET THAT WE WANT TO TRADE WITH THE RULES OF THE GAME THE RULES OF TRADE A SET IN BRUSSELS AND IT'S BETTER THAT THE U.K. IS THERE MAKING SURE U.K. INTERESTS ARE DEFENDED AND PROMOTED
RATHER THAN BEING OUT OF IT SO YOU WOULD BE BEHIND A MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ROLE IN BRUSSELS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE YES WE'D LIKE TO SEE GIVEN EUROPE'S NOT PERFECT WE'RE LIKES IT MORE COMPETITIVE AND MORE FOCUS ON TRADE HAVING THOSE MORE INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS BUT WE ALSO WANT THE U.K. TO PLAY A STRONGER ROLE IT IS IT'S BEEN A REAL SUPPORTER OF THE U.K. AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY TRYING TO ENSURE WE ARE COMPETITIVE
WE WANT THAT ENTHUSIASM FOR COMPETITION TO BE THERE IN EUROPE AS WELL SO IF THE VOTE IS TO LEAVE VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF INWARD INVESTMENT WE EXPECT THEY WERE INWARD INVESTMENT WOULD BECOME MORE DIFFICULT NOT SAYING IT WILL BECOME MORE DIFFICULT BUT IT WOULDN'T STOP IT WOULDN'T STOP COMPLETELY BUT AS A SET AT THIS YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE SHORT TERM BUT THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET THOSE INVESTMENT ROWS WHICH HAPPEN EVERY FOUR YEARS THE U.K. WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED COMPARED TO SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS WITHIN EUROPE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ITS S. AND M. T. I BEG YOUR PARDON MY CAUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL THE POUND HAS BEEN MOVING HER HEAD IN ASIA TRADE IT'S HAD A BIT OF A CHOPPY TIME OF LATE WITH ME NOW IN THE STUDIO IS JEREMY STRETCH HE'S HEAD OF F. X. STRATEGY AT SEA I.B.C. GOOD MORNING MONTANA STRETCH SO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN ASIA TRADE AND WHY
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HER I'M NOT TICKING STERLING TO START THIS WEEK AND INDEED IT CARRYING ON FROM THE IMPROVEMENT WE SAW THE ACCELERATION IN THE VALLEY IT'S ALL RIGHT AT THE END OF LAST WEEK AND THIS IS A REFLECTION OF INVESTOR SENTIMENT AS WE MOVE INTO THE UPCOMING EVENTS THIS WEEK AND IN THERE THERE IS A GENERAL REDUCTION IN UNCERTAINTY OR AT LEAST
ANNEXE AND HOPE THAT THE SCENARIO FOR THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY ISN'T GOING TO BE THE SORT OF MARKET RISK EVENT THAT CERTAINLY WAS BEING PERCEIVED EARLIER LAST WEEK THE DIFFICULTY IS FOR INVESTORS IS THOUGH IT ISN'T REALLY PRECEDENT FOR IT IT'S NOTHING WE CAN'T COMPARE IT TO ANYTHING AND THAT MIGHT WELL BE WHERE SOME INVESTORS SAY IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THE OUTCOME LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE WHICH IS GOING TO PULL OUT AND SIT ON THE SIDELINES RIGHT NOW
I SPEAK TO A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL VERSUS I'VE BEEN TRAVELLING QUITE EXTENSIVELY IN THIS THAT IS ONE OF THE TOPICS THAT'S REALLY BEEN IMPACTING AS SARA SENTIMENT IS CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE IS THIS LACK OF PRESIDENT THERE IS A FEAR THAT LET'S JUST PULL BACK AND WAIT ON THE SIDELINES UNTIL THERE IS A DEGREE OF CLARITY SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS BEEN DOING CLEARLY A SUIT ALL THOSE IN THE U.K. WHO'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND UNDERSTANDING THE MINUTIAE OF EVENTS
PERHAPS HAVE TAKEN A SLIGHTLY MORE SANGUINE RESPONSIBLE INTERNATIONAL VESTAS ARE MUCH HAPPY TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES UNTIL THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF CLARITY I THINK AT ONE WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT OUT OF THE BIG MAIN CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD AND I'M TALKING HERE THE BAGGAGE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE UNITED STATES THE MOST SPECULATION OR THAT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WENT INTEREST RATE IS AROUND THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THAT IS VERY CENTRAL OF COURSE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENCY
OF COURSE THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTRE IN THE WHOLE DEBATE REGARDING MISTER CARNEY HAS BEEN NO I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING ON INDEED BUT IN TERMS OF THE POLICY DIRECTION I THINK THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY OR CORRECT IN THAT REGARD I THINK WE KNOW WHICH DIRECTION OF TRAVEL THE U.S. WILL BE GOING IT'S A CASE OF TIMING I THINK IN THE CONTEXT OF THE U.K. IF WE SCROLL BACK TO THE BACK END OF LAST YEAR I THINK THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION THAT PERHAPS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN INTEREST RATE HIKE IN THE U.K. PERHAPS AS EARLY AS THE BACK END OF TWENTY SIXTEEN OR EARLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN
OF COURSE THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN PUT ON THE BACK BURNER AND SO THERE IS A DEGREE OF OR LACK OF CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE STRAITS ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE WE ARE DISCUSSING WHAT WHAT COULD THE BANK OF ENGLAND BE DOING IN THE UPCOMING DAYS AND WEEKS THAT HAS AGAIN ADDED TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL MARKET RIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW WE MEASURE STIRLING AND ITS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE I LOOK EVERY DAY AND IT SEEMS TO BE SEVENTY EIGHT PENCE AGAINST THE EURO
IF YOU WERE LOOKING PURELY AT THAT YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF VARIATION SO WE WEIGHED UP AGAINST A BASKET OF CURRENCIES AND WET WHAT RANGES WOULD YOU PUT ON ITS PERFORMANCE JUST SO THAT WE MIGHT GET SOME OUTER OUTER REACHES HERE WHILE WE WE'VE SEEN THEM THEIR TRADE WAITED BOSS OF STERLING MOVING BY MORE THAN TEN PER CENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE SEEN STIRLING WE CAN QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY
IF YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. DOLLAR IS A BAROMETER WE'VE SEEN A RANGE OF MORE THAN TWENTY BIG FIGURES OR ONE FIFTY EIGHT TO ONE THIRTY EIGHT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS JUST UNDERLINES THE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WE'VE SEEN I THINK WE COULD WELL SEE THOSE LOWER REACHES EXCEEDED BY SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THOUGH LATER IN THE WEEK IF WE WERE TO SEE A SCENARIO PLAYING OUT BUT IT IS A CASE THAT STIRLING HAS BEEN AN EXCEPTIONALLY VOLATILE
ASSET CLASS OVER ALL THE EXCEPTION VOLATILE CURRENCY OF THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS I THINK THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO CONTINUE OVER THE SHORT TERM UNTIL THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF CLARITY JEREMY STRETCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DID SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE MARKETS AWAY FROM THE REFERENDUM HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO AS SACHA NAS BEAR WHO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND HER OF HERMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS
GETTING A LOT OF FOCUS IS THE FACT THAT THE BOSS OF INDIA'S CENTRAL BANK IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE IN HIS ROLE WHEN HIS TURN IS UP AND WE WERE TO NORMAL CENTRAL BANKERS SOME YEARS AGO DIDN'T WE APART FROM ALAN GREENSPAN POSSIBLY NOBODY KNEW WHO THEY WERE THIS GUY HAS BEEN COMPARED TO DOUBLE O. SEVEN WHY FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS AS AN ACADEMIC HE'S AN EX R.A.F. BANKER HE WAS ONE OF HIS CHIEF ECONOMIST WASN'T IT'S RIGHT HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY PREDICT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO THAT THERE'S A THAT HE WAS PRETTY GOOD AT HIS JOB
AND THE SECOND ONE DOES HE LOOK THE DECREE OF CREDENCE TO THE INDIAN CENTRAL BANK POLICY THAT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE HE WAS VERY GOOD AT CONTROLLING THE CURRENCY HE'S STABILISED THE SITUATION AND HE BROUGHT A DEGREE OF PROFESSIONALISM WHICH WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN SEEN BEFORE AND TO SOME DEGREE AND INFLATION WAS AND INFLATION AS WAS WAS HIGH AT THE TIME AND HE COULD PROBLEMS UNDER THE GREY THE SPECULATION IS THAT
HE IS NOT SEEN AS BEING AS GUNG HO ABOUT INDIAN NATIONAL ISN'T IT IT'S TYPICAL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT THEY TALK UP HOW GOOD THE MARKET THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT HEATED THERE TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE ACADEMIC HE WAS ALSO I UNDERSTAND SLIGHTLY CONTROVERSIAL POLITICALLY IN THAT HE SPOKE HE WAS A SPOKEN ON POLITICAL MATTERS WHICH WERE SEEN AS BIGGER NO NO BYE THEY'VE BEEN RULING PARTY AND SO HE WASN'T PUSHED OUR PARTICULARLY DECIDED THAT HE'D BETTER GO BACK TO BE GET BACK IN THERE AGAIN I THINK IT'S A LOSS TO INDIA ACTUALLY
DO YOU THINK THE PRIME MINISTER SAW THEM RIVAL IN TERMS OF ATTENTION WONDERS WONDERS LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROPERTY MARKET BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MOVES AND COMMENTS ON THE FOREIGN INVESTORS BOTH IN CANADA AND IN SYDNEY IN FACT AND THERE'S SPECULATION THAN IN SYDNEY IT WILL IN FACT I THINK IT IS IN FACT IT IMPOSING TAXES ON FOREIGNERS BUYING HOMES IN THE CITY
IT IS INTERESTING HOW HOT MONEY MOVES AROUND THE GLOW VERY QUICKLY AND SETTLES ON PROPERTY AND THE FACT IT HAVE HAS OF COURSE ON THE LOCAL POPULATION IS VERY GREAT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS WITH THE SUPER LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT THERE MUST BE BOB'S BUBBLES OFF INFLATION WHERE IS IT AND YOU SEE IT SOMETIMES IN PRIME PROPERTY WE SAW IT HERE IN THE U.K. IT'S GOING ROUND TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THAT SEEMS TO BE INTENT BY SAID ME TO STOP THEM FROM CROWDING OUT THE LOCAL MARKET
SECONDS B. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANKS TANYA IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND ROB BONNET HAS THIS MORNING SPORT TELEGRAPH IMAGE SHOWING US YOUR BACK PAGES SPLASH SPECULATION THIS MORNING ABOUT THE LIKELY COMPOSITION OF ENGLAND STARTING LINE UP TODAY FOR THEIR FINAL EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN GROUP B. GAIN IT'S AGAINST SLOVAKIA THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE AS MANY AS SIX CHANGES TO THE STARTING LINE UP THAT THE WALES LAST WEEK THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT CAPTAIN WAYNE ROONEY WILL BE ARRESTED
IN ANTICIPATION OF QUALIFYING FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN BUT HERE'S MANAGER ROY HODGSON ON THE FUR FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF STARTING WITH JAMIE BUDDY AND DANIEL STURRIDGE LADIES VERY WELL WITH ME WHEN THEY CAME ON AGAINST WALES AND I'M SURE THEY'D LIKE ANOTHER CHANCE TO SO THE OPTIONS ARE THERE WE'VE SPOKEN AT LENGTH ON MANY OCCASION ABOUT THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE ESPECIALLY IN THOSE FUN POSITIONS AND NOTHING CHANGES AND IT'S A DECISION HAS TO BE MADE FOR WALES A WIN TODAY AGAINST RUSSIA WILL QUALIFY THEM FOR THE KNOCKOUT PHASE HE'S MANAGER CHRIS COLEMAN
WE'RE EXPECTING A VERY VERY TOUGH GAME OF COURSE I THINK MAYBE THE RUSSIANS BEING CRITICISED BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OPPOSITION THEY'VE PLAYED AGAINST IN THE TWO TWO TEAMS HAVE PLAYED AGAINST A GOOD TEAM
MEANWHILE FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN IN THERE WAS A FIRST WIN FOR ALBANIA WHO BEAT ROMANIA ONE NIL ELSEWHERE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ALAN SHANE LOWRY AT THE U.S. OPEN IN OAKMONT ALLOW HIS FOUR SHOT THIRD ROUND LEAD EVAPORATED AND HE FINISHED JOINT SECOND THREE SHOTS OFF THE FOUR UNDER PAR WINNING SCORE OF THE AMERICAN DUSTIN JOHNSON BUT THERE WAS CONTROVERSY HERE'S A GOLF CORRESPONDENT IN CARTER

TODAY I FOUND IN MOMENTS WOULD A CERTAIN CURE FOR LOST OF BLOOD
A NEW SERIES OF THE ECHO CHAMBER STARTS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AT FOUR THIRTY AND THEN AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND KATHY CLARKSON WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN LADY VAST SEA HAS AN OUNCE SHE SWITCHED HER SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SHE TOLD THE TIME SHE WAS ANGRY AT WHAT SHE CALLED THE HIT AND XENOPHOBIA OF PARTS OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN
SHE SAID A POSTER DEPICTING A HUGE QUEUE OF REFUGEES SPLIT OUT BY UKIP LAST WEEK HAVE BEEN A STEP TOO FAR VOTE LEAVE SAID IT WASN'T AWARE THAT LADY VARTY HAVE BEEN PART OF ITS TEAM
THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER SAID THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD DROP HE'S PLEDGED TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE CAMPION'S CHAIRWOMAN THE LABOUR M. PIGGIES LE STUART SAID THE TARGET WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET INSIDE THE E.U.
SEVERAL OF THE BIG CAR MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING THEIR SON JAGUAR LAND ROVER AND TOYOTA HAVE WRITTEN TO THEIR STAFF BACKING BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS WHICH REPRESENTS THE INDUSTRY SO ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR WERE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS
THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE HAS ALSO COME OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE MOTION WAS SUPPORTED BY ALL TWENTY OF THE LEAGUES FOOTBALL CLUBS BUT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAID E.U. MEMBERSHIP PRODUCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGLISH PLAYERS AND MEANT IT WAS HARDER TO SIGN PLAYERS FROM OUTSIDE EUROPE
PARLIAMENT IS BEING RECALLED TODAY SO THAT POLITICIANS CAN PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX SHE WAS SHOT AND STABBED IN HER WEST YORKSHIRE CONSTITUENCY LAST THURSDAY
THREE TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS WHO BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL AFTER TAKING ECSTASY IN SALFORD ON SATURDAY AND I SAID TO BE IN A STABLE CONDITION A MAN AND A WOMAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
THE RUSSIAN BORN ACTOR ANTON YELTSIN BEST KNOWN FOR PLAYING CHECK OFF IN THE RECENT STAR TREK FILMS HAS BEEN KILLED IN A FREAK ACCIDENT AT HIS HOME IN LOS ANGELES POLICE SAY YELL CHIMP HE WAS TWENTY SEVEN BECAME PINNED AGAINST A WALL WHEN HIS CAR ROLLED TOWARDS HIM ON HIS STEEP DRIVEWAY
A NEW NATIONAL NEWSPAPER FOR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN LAUNCHED TODAY IT'S CALLED TWENTY FOUR AND IS AN ATTEMPT TO DELIVER NEWS WITH LESS OF A SOUTHERN PERSPECTIVE IT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED FROM PRESTON UP TO THE SCOTTISH BORDERS
THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN IT IS A MOMENTOUS WEEK NOT JUST FOR BRITISH POLITICS BUT FOR THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER TOOK QUESTIONS ON THE REFERENDUM FROM A LIVE TELEVISION AUDIENCE THIS MORNING A PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE HAS SWITCHED SIDES IN THE E.U. DEBATE LET'S TO OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH IN NORMAN LET'S START WITH THAT DECISION BY BARONESS OF ARSEY HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT DO YOU THINK
WELL IT IS SIGNIFICANT OR BEER THE LEAVES SIDE I'LL SORT OF SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND SOME CONFUSION BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY WEREN'T ACTUALLY WHERE SHE WAS A MEMBER OR A SUPPORTER OF THEIRS AND IT'S TRUE
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN PART IN ANY SPEECHES OR MAJOR EVENTS BUT SHE SENSED SHE BACK BRAKES SHE NOW DOESN'T WHY BECAUSE SHE SAYS OF QUOTES THE HATE AND XENOPHOBIA IN THEIR CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY AROUND IMMIGRATION SHE SITES IN PARTICULAR THAT POSTER BY NIGEL FARRAJ PICKED PICTURING THAT LONG QUEUE OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO GET INTO SOUTHERN EUROPE UNDER THE HEADLINE BREAKING POINT AND SHE ALSO ACCUSED MICHAEL GO FOR TELLING QUOTES COMPLETE LIES OVER TURKEY'S ADMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SIGNIFICANCE I THINK IT'S NOT
WHO SHE IS WHAT SHE'S DONE BUT WHAT SHE'S SAYING BECAUSE SHE POINTS TO WHAT I THINK IS BECOMING THE KEY VULNERABILITY OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN THESE LAST FEW DAYS AND THAT HIS TONE AND THE DANGER THAT THEY GET SUCKED UP INTO THE SLIPSTREAM OF NIGEL FARRAJ IS MUCH MORE ABRASIVE APPROACH
TO THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND THAT THEY BECOME ASSOCIATED IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND AS ALL ONE AND THE SAME AND THAT IS WHY I THINK OVER THE WEEKEND WE SAW A CLUSTER OF BIG HITTERS ON THE BRAKES IT SIDE DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THAT POSTERS AND ALSO TRYING TO ADOPT A MORE CONFIDENT OUT LOOKING POSITIVE APPROACH BORIS JOHNSON SAYING FOR EXAMPLE HE WAS IN FAVOUR OF AN AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS WHO'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWELVE YEARS OR MORE AND ALSO IN TODAY'S DAILY TELEGRAPH STRESSING
HE RESENTS THE SUGGESTION BUT SOMEHOW SHE AND OTHERS LIKE HIM ARE AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF MODERN BRITAIN BUT I THINK THEY'RE REAL FEAR AND IT HAS BEEN THERE FILL ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIS ASSOCIATION WITH NIGEL FARRAH SHARON WHERE THE CAMPAIGNS OF VULNERABLE NORMAN LOOKING AT THE PRIME MINISTER LAST NIGHT AND THE QUESTIONS HE TOOK FROM FROM THAT QUESTION TIME AUDIENCE IT WAS IMMIGRATION WHICH WHICH PROVIDED SOME OF THE DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR HIM IT WAS AT
THERE WAS A SORT OF FAMILIARITY IN THE NATURE OF THE EXCHANGE IS AGAIN AND AGAIN MISTER CAMERON TACKLED OVER THE DEAL HE DONE AND WHETHER THAT WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON MIGRATION WHETHER IT BE SUBJECT TO AN E.U. VETO WOW HOW LONG IT WOULD ACTUALLY LAST FOR WHETHER HIS TARGET WAS STILL A TARGET OF GETTING IT DOWN TO THE TENS THOUSANDS OF WHETHER IT'S NOW AN AMBITION WOODY VITO TURKEY AND HE HE'S HE STRUGGLES
ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION THE I THINK I THINK IT'S STRIKING IS A LEVEL OF SCEPTICISM CYNICISM MANATEES HOSTILITY HE SEEMS TO FACE PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE SCAREMONGERING ALLEGATIONS AND WHAT WE'VE GOT INSTEAD WAS A FAMILIAR REFRAIN IN TERMS OF RETREATING BACK INTO THE ECONOMY SINGLE MARKET LOOK AT WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY THE ONE OTHER THING WHICH I DID THINK WAS INTERESTING AND WE ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE OF MY CAMERA MISTER OSBORNE IS THE REVERSE ABILITY OF THIS DECISION AND I THINK THE THINKING IS THEIR RESEARCH SUGGESTS AS YOU GET NEARER THE VOTES THE UNDECIDED
TEND TO GRAVITATE AWAY FROM RISK AND IT SEEMS TO ME BY STRESSING THAT THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME THERE'S NO GOING BACK IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE IRELAND OR DENMARK BY STRESSING THE REVERSE ABILITY TO RAISE THE STAKES AND THE RISK AND THEREBY TRY AND SORT OF PUSHED THOSE WAVERERS BACK IN TO THE REMAIN CAMP HEATED FINAL DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN BUT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT WHEN M.P.S COME BACK TO THE TO THE HOUSE TODAY'S PARLIAMENTS RECALLED WE GET TRIBUTES TO JOE COX
TWO THIRTY THIS AFTERNOON AND OUR OF TRIBUTES WHICH WILL BE BEGUN BY THE SPEAKER THAN THE PRIME MINISTER THAN JEREMY CORBIN THEN OPENED OUT TO M.P.S ON ALL SIDES INTERESTING THERE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT M.P.S MIGHT NOT SIT IN THE NORMAL BENCHES THEY MIGHT SIT WITH EACH OTHER I THINK THAT MIGHT BE RELATIVELY LIMITED BECAUSE I SUSPECT MOST M.P.S WILL WANT TO SIT WITH FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES AND THEN AFTER THAT THEY MOVE OVER TO SAINT MARGARET'S A CHURCH THE ONLY
TIME I SORT OF RECALLED SIMILAR EVENT WAS PROBABLY JOHN SMITH'S DEATH AND THE ONE THING I NOTICE ABOUT IT IS THAT ONE ALWAYS THINKS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AS A VERY CONFRONTATIONAL ABRASIVE ENVIRONMENT IS STRIKING ON THESE OCCASIONS HOW EMOTIONAL THOUGHTFUL AND INDEED REFLECTIVE THE CHAMBER CAN OFTEN BE AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT TODAY NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW WE KNOW THAT ECSTASY IS A PARTY DRUG THAT CAN KILL WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL NOW IS THAT THE VERY YOUNG ARE BEING TARGETED THREE TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS ARE IN HOSPITAL IN SALFORD HAVING TAKEN WHAT A CHILLINGLY CALLED TEDDY TABLETS AND ARE CLEARLY TARGETED AT THE VERY YOUNG DAVE GUEST IS B.B.C. NORTH WEST TONIGHT'S QI FOR US PORTER AND JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM SALFORD MORNING TO YOU DAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT NEWS FOR MANY PEOPLE WILL BE HOW THE GIRLS ON
MORNING YES WELL THANKFULLY THEIR CONDITION HAS IMPROVED OVERNIGHT WHEN THEY WERE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON SATURDAY NIGHT THEY WERE IN A VERY POOR STATE THE POLICE WERE CALLED TO THE SALFORD SHOPPING CENTRE
AT AROUND TEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY NIGHTS REPORTS THAT ONE GIRL APPEARED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF OVERDOSE WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY FOUND THIS GIRL IN A VERY DISTRESSED STATE AND SHE TOLD THEM THAT SHE'D TAKEN SOMETHING CALLED THE TEDDY TABLET AND THAT TWO OF HER FRIENDS HAVE DONE LIKEWISE THE POLICE THEN FOUND THE OTHER TWO TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS IN SURROUNDING STREETS AND ALL THREE OF THEM
WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL THE POLICE PARTICULARLY DISTURB AS YOU SAY ABOUT THE VERY YOUNG AGE OF THESE GIRLS IN THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF THESE TABLETS IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY TOOK THE TABLETS DISSOLVED INTO SOME KIND OF SOFT DRINK COS THE QUESTION
DID THEY DO THAT KNOWINGLY WAS THE SOFT DRINK GIVEN TO THEM WITH THE TABLET ALREADY INNIT THIS OF COURSE IS GOING TO FORM PART OF THE POLICE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS CASE THIS LABELLING TEDDY TABLETS HOW NEW IS IT AS FAR AS THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED OR IS IT JUST THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO LOWER THE AGE AT WHICH YOU CAN TARGET ECSTASY ON THE
IT'S JUST THE LATEST FORM OF THIS PARTICULAR DRUG THE DIFFICULTY WITH ECSTASY IS IT KEEPS CHANGING ITS IT'S MAKE UP FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAD A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO DIED FROM TAKING AN ECSTASY TABLET IN A NIGHT SPOT NOT FAR FROM HERE IN THE NEIGHBOURING BOROUGH OF TRAFFORD JUST LAST MONTH NOW THE TABLETS SHE TOOK WAS CALLED MASTERCARD SO THESE THINGS KEEP POPPING UP IN DIFFERENT FORMS DIFFERENT GUISES
BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM IS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CHEMICAL COMPONENTS ARE OF THESE DRUGS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT REACTION THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE ON YOUR BODY AND OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD A TERRIBLE REACTION ON THE BODIES OF THESE THREE TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS THANKFULLY HOPEFULLY IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE IMPROVING NOW BUT THE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH WORSE NOW A MAN AND WOMAN
ARRESTED OVERNIGHT ON SUSPICION OF POSSESSING A CLASS A. CONTROLLED DRUG THEY'RE STILL BEING QUESTIONED BY THE CHURCHES IN SALFORD MEANTIME OF COURSE DOCTORS LOOKING AFTER THESE THREE GIRLS IN HOSPITAL THIS MORNING DAVE GUEST THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE SENIOR VOTE LEAVE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN A BORIS JOHNSON USES HIS COLUMN IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TO URGE PEOPLE TO SEIZE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY AND CHANGED THE COURSE OF EUROPEAN HISTORY HE SAYS THAT ALL VOTERS NEED TO DO IS BELIEVE IN WHAT BRITAIN CAN DO THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. INSISTS THE REMAIN CAMP OFFERS NOTHING APART FROM A MISERABLE EROSION OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY MAIL WHICH THE PAPER DESCRIBES AS MISTER JOHNSON'S DIRECT APPEAL TO WOMEN
HE SAYS THE TAKING BACK CONTROL OF MIGRATION WILL MEAN YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING HOME THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY LORD PATTEN WHO WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EAR OF COURSE HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES IN WHICH HE STRONGLY CRITICISES MY JOHNSON AND THE CO CHAIR OF VOTE LEAVE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE THE PEER DESCRIBED THEM AS RUEFULLY SANCTIMONIOUS AND CALLS ON THE M.P.S TO REFLECT ON THEIR ARGUMENTS LORD PATTEN SAYS THE CASE FOR LEAVING THE E.U. ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS
WAS LOST WHICH IS MEANT IMMIGRATION TOOK CENTRE STAGE IN AN UNPLEASANTLY DECEITFUL WAY THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER SIR JOHN MAJOR TELLS THE F.T. THE REFERENDUM IT'S BECOME A BATTLE BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND EMOTION THE SON SAYS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN MADE A CONFESSION YESTERDAY WHEN HE ADMITTED THERE'S NO UPPER LIMIT TO E.U. MIGRANTS COMING TO BRITAIN IF THERE'S A VOTE TO REMAIN THE PAPER ADMIRES HIS HONESTY BUT BELIEVES HE IS IGNORING MILLIONS OF HIS VOTERS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRATION
MISTER CORBIN HAS ACCORDING TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH INFURIATED HIS MODERATE EM PEASE WHO WARNED THAT HE COULD SINGLE HANDEDLY COS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THE REFERENDUM BY ALIENATING THE PARTY'S TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS THE SON HAS LEARNT THAT THE FORMER TORY CHANCELLOR KEN CLARKE IS PLANNING TO RETIRE AS AN M. P. MORE THAN FORTY FIVE YEARS AFTER HE WAS ELECTED TO THE COMMONS HE SAYS THAT HE WON'T BE STANDING IN THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION IS FELLOW TORY BACKBENCHER SIR NICHOLAS SOAMES TELLS THE MIRROR THERE MISTER CLARK'S DEPARTURE WILL BE A BIG LOSS
THE GUARDIAN REPORTS ON WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE BIGGEST DIVORCE CASE IN HISTORY WHICH COULD END UP IN THE BRITISH COURTS IF THE SETTLEMENT ISN'T REACHED IN RUSSIA THE DISPUTE HAS BEEN AS BETWEEN ITALIA PETAR WHO NOW LIVES IN LONDON AND WAS MARRIED TO ONE OF RUSSIA'S RICHEST OLIGARCHS BLOODY MO PUT ON IT
THEY ARE GUARDIAN UNDERSTANDS HE'S WORTH MORE THAN NINE BILLION POUNDS AND HIS EX WIFE IS SEEKING HALF OF HIS FORTUNE BECAUSE SHE CLAIMED IT WAS A CRUDE AFTER THEY FELL IN LOVE AS PENNILESS STUDENTS IN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE TIMES REPORTS THAT THE FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE SOCIETY IS SEETHING BECAUSE A VICTORIAN HEROINE ALMOST FADED INTO OBSCURITY IS ABOUT TO GET HER OWN BRONZE STATUE WHICH WILL BE TALL
THE NIGHTINGALES AT WATERLOO PLACE IN CENTRAL LONDON MARY SEACOLE STATUTE WALTZ ALSO STAND OUTSIDE SAINT THOMAS'S HOSPITAL IN LONDON WHERE FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE FOUNDED HER NURSING SCHOOL THE PAPERS THERE'S MARY SEACOLE WAS VOTED THE GREATEST BLACK BRITON BUT A GROUP OF HISTORIANS BELIEVE HER ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE CRIMEAN WAR HAD BEEN EXAGGERATED THE STATUE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE NURSING PROFESSION
OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THE PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN LADY VESEY HAS SAID SHE NO LONGER SUPPORTS BRICKS IT BECAUSE SOME CAMPAIGNERS ARE SPREADING XENOPHOBIA AND LIVES SHE WILL NOW BACK TO REMAIN SIDE VOTE LEAVE SAID IT WASN'T AWARE THAT SHE WAS PART OF ITS TEAM THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE STATE CONTROLLED CHINESE MEDIA HAS BEEN REPORTING THE EXISTENCE OF A DOCUMENT DATING FROM THE MING DYNASTY AND SAID TO PROVE BEIJING'S CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER MOST OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WITH AN INTERNATIONAL RULING ON THE CONTESTED WATER'S EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS CHINA VIEWS THE ANCIENT TEXT AS PROOF IF HISTORY IS ON ITS SIDE A BEIJING CORRESPONDENT JOHN SOUTHWORTH HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING
I'VE GOT THE FISH BEING LANDED HERE IN THE PORT OF TEN MEN ON CHINA'S SOUTHERN COAST ARE FROM SOME OF THE MOST CONTESTED WATER'S ON THERE
BUT THE CHINESE BOAT CAPTAINS ARE UNANIMOUS IN THEIR VIEW THAT'S GOING WITH HER MOTHER
OF COURSE THE SOUTH CHINA SEA BELONGS TO CHINA THIS CAPTAIN TELLS ME WE'VE BEEN GOING THERE FOR GENERATIONS
EVAN EVAN GENERATIONS OF OTHER FISHERMEN
ALSO BEEN
HE SMILES AND WAVES ME AWAY TELLING ME HE NEEDS TO GET ON WITH HIS WORK
THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT NARRATIVE FOLLOWS A SIMILAR LINE CHINA HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL UP TO NINETY PER CENT OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IT ARGUES BECAUSE ITS FISHERMEN WERE THERE FIRST AND RECENTLY STATE RUN MEDIA HAS BEEN REPORTING AN EXTRAORDINARY FIND
A SIX HUNDRED YEAR OLD BOOK BELONGING TO A RETIRED FISHERMAN WHICH IS SAID TO RECORD PRECISE NAVIGATIONAL DIRECTIONS TO FAR DISTANT ROCKS AND FEATURES
IT IS DESCRIBED AS NOTHING LESS THAN IRON CLAD PROOF OF CHINA'S SOVEREIGNTY AND WITH AN INTERNATIONAL COURT RULING ON THE LEGITIMACY OF CHINA'S TERRITORIAL CLAIMS EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE EXISTENCE OF THE DOCUMENT IS BEING GIVEN PROMINENT COVERAGE IN STATE RUN MEDIA
SO WE WENT TO MEET THE OWNER EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD SUE CHEONG FUN WHO NOW SPENDS HIS TIME INTERNMENT MAKING MODEL BOATS
YOU DON'T HAVE YOU STOP THAT
ADAM WAS PASSED DOWN FROM MY GRANDFATHER'S GENERATION TO MY FATHER'S GENERATION THEN TO MEET IN MANY TOP HOLE TO GO TO THE PARIS AND SPRIGHTLY ISLANDS AND HOW TO GET BACK HOME
BUT THEN WHEN WE ASK TO SEE THE BOOK THERE'S A SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT DOUBLE DOORS I'M GUTTED ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK WAS IMPORTANT I THREW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT WAS BROKEN SO YOU'VE LOST THE BOOK YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE CORNER
IT IS NOT THAT I LOST IT IT WAS FLIPPED THROUGH TOO MANY TIMES THE SALTY SEA WATER FROM OUR HANDS HAD CORRODED THE BOOK THE JELLO IN THE END I WAS NO LONGER UNREADABLE SO WHY THROW IT AWAY
WHY CHINA IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CLAIM THAT ITS FISHERMEN HAVE LONG BEEN USING THESE WATERS BUT A SIX HUNDRED YEAR OLD BOOK WOULD BE A POWERFUL DOCUMENT
WITHOUT IT THOUGH IT OFFERS IRON CLAD PROOF OF NOTHING AT ALL EXCEPT PERHAPS THE WILLINGNESS OF CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTY RUN MEDIA NOT TO LET A FEW FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF THE OFFICIAL HISTORICAL NARRATIVE
JOHN SAID WORTH REPORTING THERE IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT DOES SOME HOSPITALS GIVE SUCH AN INADEQUATE SERVICE AND OTHERS DO SO MUCH BETTER WELL IT IS NOT MONEY BUT MANAGEMENT WHICH HOLDS THE KEY ACCORDING TO THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION WHEN THEY APPEARED ON THE PROGRAMME RECENTLY TO CONDEMN THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE HOSPITAL IN PORTSMOUTH A REPORTER CENTURY BERGER'S BEEN INVESTIGATING WHY A NEARBY HOSPITAL IN WORTHING DOES SEEM TO PERFORM SO MUCH BETTER SHE FOLLOWED THE PROGRESS OF ONE PATIENT WERE CALLING HER MISSUS C. THROUGH THE HOSPITAL
HE WAS QUITE PALE SHE HAD A DEGREE OF TACHYCARDIA SO A FASTER HEART RATE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED INTO ONE OF OUR CUBICLES IN A MAJORS AREA
THREE HOURS AND SEVERAL TESTS LATER THIS IS C. WAS MOVED ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO THE EMERGENCY FLOOR THIS IS AN INNOVATION OR WALK IN CARE CENTRE
AND SIXTY SEVEN BEDS FOR MEDICAL SURGICAL OR FRAIL PATIENTS ROGER DUCKETT IS CLINICAL DIRECTOR FOR ACUTE MEDICINE AT WEST SUSSEX SO FOR PATIENTS IT MEANS THAT THEY GET PUT INTO HER BED
THEY GET THE TEAM COMING TO THEM THEY DON'T NEED TO MOVE AND THEY GET THE RIGHT TREATMENT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AS FAST AS POSS
EVER SINCE WE OPENED AMY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THAT THEY COULD FEEL THAT PATIENTS WERE STAYING IN THE ONLY DEPARTMENT FELICE
OWING TO HIM MORE OF THAT REPORT AND INDEED FROM THE ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES INVOLVED A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT BEFORE WE DO LET'S HEAR FROM CHRIS HAM IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE RESPECTED HELL THINK TANG THE KING'S FUND MORNING TO YOU CHRIS GOOD MORNING HOW HOW IMPORTANT ARE INNOVATIONS LIKE THIS SO CALLED EMERGENCY FLOOR LISTENERS MIGHT THINK SOUNDS A BIT OBVIOUS THAT WHY WOULDN'T EVERYBODY
IT IS IMPORTANT AND WORTHING IS TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR PROVIDING SUCH A GREAT SERVICE WHAT I'D SAY IS A E. IS THE INTERSECTION OF THE N.H.S. IT'S A BIT LIKE THE SPAGHETTI JUNCTION IF I COULD SAY THAT SPEAKING FROM BIRMINGHAM
THIS MORNING WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO MANAGE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE INTERSECTION AS WORTHING IS VERY WELL HAVING SENIOR DOCTORS THERE TO SEE PATIENTS IN SOME CASES A CHOLO KATE'S WITH G.P.S WHO CAN SEE THOSE WITH MINOR CONDITIONS BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW PATIENTS GET TO ANY IN THE FIRST PLACE BY FOR EXAMPLE
PROVIDING GOOD MEDICAL CARE IN CARE HOMES TO HELP PEOPLE REMAIN IN THOSE HOMES RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO A. AND E. IN THE FIRST PLACE NOW THAT OF COURSE RAISES THE ISSUE OF FUNDING THOUGH DOESN'T IT SO ALTHOUGH THE C.Q. SEE SAID IT WASN'T CASH THAT MATTERS IN A. AND E. MANY PEOPLE IN HOSPITALS OR TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO CASH FOR SOCIAL CARE THAT BEDS ARE BLOCKED WE CAN'T GET PATIENTS OUT TO DEAL WITH STRIKING THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND SIMON STEPHEN SAID IF THERE'S ANY MORE MONEY TO SPEND SPEND IT THERE DON'T SPEND IT ON THE N.H.S.
IT'S ABOUT BOTH THINGS OF COURSE NICK FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE RESOURCES YOU'VE GOT WELL TO MAKE SURE THE GOOD PRACTICE IS IMPLEMENTED EVERYWHERE AND YOU DON'T GET THE HUGE VARIATIONS IN CARE WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING FOR EXAMPLE NORTH MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL IS REALLY STRUGGLING WITH A PAW A ANY SERVICE WITHIN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE LET'S DO AS WELL AS WE CAN LET'S HAVE THOSE SENIOR DOCTORS THEY'RE REPLICATE THE INNOVATIONS BUT YES SIMON STEVENS IS RIGHT SOCIAL CARERS BEEN CUT IT WILL BE CUT EVEN FURTHER IF YOU CAN'T
DISCHARGE PATIENTS FROM BEDS YOU CAN'T ADMIT PATIENTS FROM A ANY INTO THE SAME BED SO MORE RESOURCES FOR SOCIAL CARE TO PROVIDE THE CARE PACKAGES TO GET PEOPLE HOME IN A TIMELY WAY AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT WHEN MOST PEOPLE WANT IT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOCIAL CARE CAN PLAY ITS PART THROUGH ADEQUATE FUNDING THERE ONE THING THAT WAS MEANT TO HELP OVER THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS WAS FREEDOMS FOR HOSPITALS OR COMPETITION IN OTHER WORDS
THE BEST WOULD REALLY SHOW OFF HOW GOOD THEY WERE THE WORST WOULD EFFECTIVELY GO OUT OF BUSINESS HOW'S THAT GOING COMPETITION HAS NOT DELIVERED WHAT ITS PROPONENTS PROMISED WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED AND SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS LABOUR CONSERVATIVE COALITION HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH AUTONOMY FOR HOSPITALS PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION TO COMPETE BELIEVING THAT WILL IMPROVE PATIENT CARE THAT HE'S AN EXPERIMENT THAT HAS CLEARLY FAILED
AND THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IF YOU'RE COMPETING YOU CAN'T COLLABORATE AND SHARE IN THE SAME WAY WHAT WE NEED IS MUCH MORE EMPHASIS ON IDENTIFYING WHAT WORKS ELSEWHERE COLLABORATING SHARING THAT SO IT BECOMES COMMON PRACTICE ACROSS THE N.H.S. AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE COMPETITION HAS BEEN GIVEN PRIORITY UNTIL RECENTLY IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO SHARE LEARN AND COLLABORATE IN THE WAY THE N.H.S. REQUIRES SO BRIEFLY IN RESPONSE TO WHAT THE C.Q. C. WOULD SAY
YOU SEEM TO BE OF COURSE MONEY MATTERS BUT MANAGEMENT MATTERS HUGELY TO MANAGEMENT MATTERS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY IT'S THE WORKFORCE MANY A. AND E. DEPARTMENT STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T RECRUIT A SPECIALIST TRAINED DOCTORS TO PROVIDE THE HIGH QUALITY CARE WE NEED TO PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT AS THE RESOURCING THAT'S AVAILABLE CHRIS HAMMER THE KING'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL HEAR MORE OF SANCHA BERG'S REPORT AND INDEED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HOSPITAL AFTER SEVEN THIRTY
THE TIME IS NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN PARLIAMENTARY RECALLS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND WHEN THE BENCHES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PHIL TODAY IT WILL BE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PAYING TRIBUTE TO ONE OF ITS OWN THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX HER FELLOW YORKSHIRE M. P. THE CONSERVATIVE JASON MCCARTNEY HAS SUGGESTED THAT M.P.S PEAS BE ALLOWED TO SIT WHEREVER THEY LIKE RATHER THAN WITH THEIR OWN PARTY COLLEAGUES THIS AFTERNOON HE JOINS US FROM THE RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING

ALONG WITH JOE LOUIS BARRY SHAMAN THE LABOUR M.P. FOR HUDDERSFIELD AND ALSO PULL THE SHERIFF THE LABOUR M.P. FOR DEWSBURY AND JUST THE FACT IN WHICH WE'D ALWAYS BEEN A CLOSE KNIT TEAM ALWAYS WORKED TOGETHER ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE DON'T ACTUALLY REALISE THAT M.P.S OF ALL PARTIES DO YOU WORK TOGETHER DO HAVE FRIENDSHIPS ACROSS PARTY LINES

GET THEIR M.P.S FROM ALL PARTIES WORKING ON CAMPAIGNS IT CAN REALLY ADAM TO IT AND THAT'S THE WAY JOE WORKED AND CERTAINLY THAT'S THE LIMIT I'LL REMEMBER HER AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN OR WHEN WHEN WE SEE M.P.S COME INTO THE CHAMBER THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH YOUR CALL FOR FOR PEOPLE TO SIT ACROSS PARTY LINES HAS BEEN WELCOMED IN REALITY M.P.S MIGHT WANT TO SIT WITH THEIR CLOSEST COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW PROBABLY WITH THOSE THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH THE MOST WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY
ABSOLUTELY I THINK TODAY IS IS ALL ABOUT REMEMBERING JOE PAYING TRIBUTE TO JO BUT I THINK WE ALSO WANT IT TO BE UPBEAT AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I'LL REMEMBER IT WHEN I LAST SAW IN PARLIAMENT I THINK IT'S MONDAY TUESDAY LAST WEEK RUSHING AROUND
SHE TAPPED ME ON THE ARM AND SAID HIYA JASON HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND AS WE BOTH RUSHED OFF TO OUR OUR NEXT APPOINTMENT SHE WAS AN INCREDIBLY UPBEAT SMILEY POSITIVE PERSON WELL YOU'LL HAVE ENERGY SO SO THAT'S IT ON THE LABOUR SIDE WHICH IS WHAT I WANT

WE'LL ALSO BE TALKING TO SIDE OF ARSEY ABOUT HER DECISION TO SWITCH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM AND THE RECALL OF PARLIAMENT YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON
GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE TWENTIETH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN LADY VESEY HAS SAID SHE NO LONGER SUPPORTS THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IS NOW BACKING THE REMAIN SIDE
THAT LEAVES SAYS DAVID CAMERON MUST ABANDON THE TORY MANIFESTO PLEDGE TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CHEAT
AND PARLIAMENT HAS BEING RECALLED TO ALLOW POLITICIANS OF ALL PARTIES TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE M.P. JOE COX THE BIG USES WITH THIS MORNING BY CATHY TUCKS THEM THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN LADY VICE SAYS SHE'S CHANGED HER MIND AND IS NOW SUPPORTING THE CAMPAIGN TO REMAIN IN THE E. SHE TOLD THE TIME SHE WAS ANGRY AT WHAT SHE CALLED THE HIT AND XENOPHOBIA PARTS OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN IN PARTICULAR ARE UKIP POSTER SHOWING REFUGEES ON THE BORDER BETWEEN SLOVENIA AND CROATIA
SHE ALSO ACCUSED MICHAEL GO OVER TELLING COMPLETE LIES ABOUT TURKEYS POSSIBLE MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. BUT VOTE LEAVE SAID IT DIDN'T REMEMBER LADY VARTY EVER BEING ON ITS SIDE A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN RIGHT HAS THE STORY LADY VARTY HAD VOICED HER SUPPORT FOR LEAVING THE E.U. ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN RECENT MONTHS BUT ALSO HER GROWING ANGER WITH THE TOAD AND TACTICS OF BRECHT'S IT CAMPAIGNERS
EARLIER THIS MONTH SHE WROTE AN OPEN LETTER ATTACKING COMMENTS MADE BY NIGEL FARRAJ AND IT WAS A POSTER DEPICTING A HUGE QUEUE OF REFUGEES PUT OUT BY UKIP LAST WEEK THAT WAS FOR HER A STEP TOO FAR
NIGEL FARAGE IS NOT IN THE OFFICIAL VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BUT LADY VASE HE TOLD THE TIMES SHE COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT TACTICS THAT IN HER WORD'S SPREAD HATE AND XENOPHOBIA
THE TORY PEER SAID SHE HAD WANTED THE LEAD CAMPAIGN TO BE MORE OUTWARD LOOKING AND ALSO ACCUSED THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOES OVER TELLING COMPLETE LIES ABOUT TURKEY'S ACCESSION TO THE E.U.

THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD DROP HIS PLEDGE TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CAMPAIGN THE LABOUR M.P. DIESEL OR STUART SO THE TARGET WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MATE UNLESS THE U.K. VOTED TO LEAVE
HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO MAKE ITS FINAL APPEAL ABOUT HER VOTES FOR DEMOCRACY SO IT IS PRESSING THIS POINT ON IMMIGRATION THAT PROMISING TO CONTROL THE NUMBERS YET CONSISTENTLY FAILING TO DO SO IS CORROSIVE OF PEOPLE'S TRUST IN POLITICIANS
HE'S LE STUART SAID IF THEY REMAIN SIDE WON THE REFERENDUM THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD SCRAP THE TARGET TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING BUT HE KNOWS HE'S IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID ASK DURING THE B.B.C.'S QUESTION TIME ABOUT THE NUMBERS MY CAMERON CONCEDED THAT CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION WAS VERY CHALLENGING BUT SAID HIS Y. U. RENEGOTIATION WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE HE ALSO ACCUSED HIS OPPONENTS OF TELLING UNTRUTHS ABOUT TURKEY JOINING THE E.U.

THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IN THE FINAL FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BIGGEST DECISION BRITAIN WILL MAKE FOR YEARS A PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE HAS SWITCH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE FROM LEAVE TO REMAIN SIDE OF ARSEY BARONESS FARSI FORMER CO CHAIR OF THE PARTY AND FORMER GOVERNMENT MINISTER HAS ACCUSED LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE SPREADING HATE AND XENOPHOBIA AND TELLING LIES PARTICULARLY SINGLING OUT WHAT MICHAEL GO HAS SAID ABOUT TURKEY SHE JOINS US NOW
FROM THE RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU TOLD THE TIMES THAT YESTERDAY WAS A WAS A PARTICULAR MOMENT FOR YOU IN MAKING THIS DECISION WHY
TO WAKE UP ON SUNDAY MORNING AND TURN ON THEIR TELEVISION AFTER HAVING HAD A PAUSING CAMPAIGNING AND TO HEAR BOTH MICHAEL GO OF CONTINUE TO REPEAT THEIR LIVES IN RELATION TO TURKEY'S ACCESSION TO THE E.U. ON TO HEAR NIGEL FARRAJ DEFEND HIS INDEFENSIBLE POSTER REALLY FOR ME WAS THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN I WHEN I REALISE THAT ACTUALLY IT WAS
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO CARRY ON SUPPORTING HER POSITION ALONGSIDE PEOPLE WHO HAD A VERY DIFFERENT VISION OF BRITAIN THAN I DID WHEN YOU SAY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING PEOPLE ON ON THE LEAVES SIDE THEY SAID TODAY THAT THEY NEVER REALISED THAT YOU WERE SUCH A SUPPORTER OF THEIRS AND YOU DIDN'T TAKE PART IN ANY OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNS EVENTS DID YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY SPEECHES
WELL I WAS MAKING THE CASE TO LEAVE A LONG BEFORE VOTE CLEVE HAD EVEN FORMALLY BEEN ESTABLISHED WHAT WAY CAMPAIGNING FOR BRECHT'S IT LAST SUMMER BUILDING THE FOUNDATION OF BRINGING ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICE TOOL WOULD BE HEARD IN THIS BRECHT'S IT CAMPAIGN IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME
THAT EVERYBODY IN BRITAIN COULD TAKE PART IN THIS DEBATE AND TO PRESENT A VISION FOR BRECHT'S IT THE REASON FOR BREAKFAST IF YOU HAVEN'T IT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PART OF THE OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN FACT DANIEL HANNAN ANY P. SAID WHEN I INVITED SIDE OF US TO JOIN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SHE DECLINED OH THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE THE LAST TIME I OPENLY SPOKE FOR BRECHT'S IT WAS ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO ON THE LAST TIME I DID MEDIA ON THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO
BUT THE DISCUSSIONS THAT I HAD WITH DANIEL AND HE'S BEEN VERY DISINGENUOUS WHEN HE SAYS HE'S DANIEL HE'S A GOOD FRIEND BUT I HAD A CONVERSATION VERY EARLY ON WITH HIM AND A NUMBER OF VERY SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN WHICH I SAID THAT THE VISION THAT WE NEEDED TO PRESENT WAS ONE THAT I DEFINED AS HELLO WORLD AS AN OPTIMISTIC VISION OF WHERE BRITAIN STANDS IN THE WORLD HOW IT TRADES FREELY IS OPEN TO THE BRIGHTEST AND BREAST FROM AROUND THE WORLD IS ROOTED IN ITS HUMANITARIAN INSTINCT
BUT UNFORTUNATELY DAY AFTER DAY WHAT WE ARE SEEING AS THEIR VISION FOR BRITAIN LIES AND XENOPHOBIC CAMPAIGN WE ALWAYS SEEM TO HEAR ALL WE SEEM TO HERE THIS IS IMPORTANT WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE INSTINCTIVELY YOU'RE A SCEPTIC HORFIELD E. UNIS REFORM AND WHO WANT TO REBALANCE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE FEELING THAT THEY NOW HAVE TO LEAVE LEAVE BECAUSE DAY AFTER DAY WHAT ARE WE HEARING
THE REFUGEES ARE COMING THE RAPISTS ARE COMING THE TURKS ARE COMING LINKING THE TEXT TO CRIMINALITY LUSCIOUS EXTREME IT'S SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT YOU'VE MADE TWO VERY SPECIFIC POINTS ABOUT WHAT YOU HEARD YESTERDAY ONE WAS ABOUT THE POSTER AND I'LL COME TO THAT IN A MOMENT BUT ABOUT MICHAEL GO FOR REPEATING LIES ABOUT TURKEY WHAT DID HE SAY THAT WAS A LIE
OR TO SUGGEST THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE TURKEY IS ON THE VERGE OF JOINING THE E.U. TO SUGGEST THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY TURKISH CITIZENS WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE UNITED KINGDOM BECAUSE ACCESSION WILL TAKE PLACE TO SUGGEST EVEN ACCESSION AREN'T PERVERT TO SUGGEST EVEN THAT THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE REFUGEE CRISIS IN WHICH TURKEY WAS DISCUSSING
THESE VISA FREE TRAVEL WHICH WAS ONLY TO THE SHANDON AREA TO SUGGEST THAT THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS A LIE BUT I THINK YOUR TROWEL SUGGESTED I GO I SHIP AND TODAY NO COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH THAT ACCESSION PROCESS HAS BEEN REFUSED AT IT THERE THEY APPLIED TO DECADES AGO ED THERE ARE OVER THIRTY SIX CHAPTERS I THINK THAT NEEDED TO BE DISCUSSED OF WHICH HALF HAVE BEEN OPENED AND WHICH ONE HAS BEEN CLOSED THAT IS THE JOURNEY TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW IMMINENT
BUT ALSO TO SUGGEST AS I SAID BEFORE THAT THIS KIND OF OTHER RING OF THE COMMUNITY BRITISH TURKISH COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR OVER FIVE OR SIX DECADES TO TRY AND SUGGEST THAT THAT IS ONE LINK BETWEEN CRIMINALITY AND TURKISH COMMUNITIES TO SUGGEST THAT TURKISH COMMUNITIES THAT EVERYBODY IN TURKEY IS ON THE VERGE OF UPPING STICKS AND ARRIVING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SCAREMONGERING RUBBISH NOT RUBBISH AND THAT'S RATHER DIFFERENT FROM FROM TALKING ABOUT TURKEYS
TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN KNOW I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT ABOUT THE POSTER AND YOU SAID YOU TALKED ABOUT NIGEL NOT LIKING HER NIGEL FARAGE DEFENDED THE POSTER I MEAN IT WON'T HAVE ESCAPED YOU THAT PEOPLE ON THE LEAVES SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT MICHAEL GO AND CHRIS GRAYLING HAVE SAID HOW MUCH THEY DISLIKE THAT POSTER
AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE POINT THAT I MADE RIGHT AT THE OUTSET WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAY THAT THE VISION THAT WE MUST PRESENT FOR BRECHT THE VISION THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE PRESENTING THE LOUD VOICES SHOULD BE FROM MODERATES WHO BELIEVE THAT BRITAIN HAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE FROM THE HELLO WILDERS NOT FROM THE LITTLE ISLAND WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THAT ABOUT POSTER WHAT WAS SO WRONG WITH IT IN YOUR FEET
HOW IS THAT POSTER EVEN DEFENSIBLE WHAT IS THAT POSTER EVEN SUGGESTED THE FACT THAT FIRST OF ALL IT IS PERPETUATING A SET OF LIES ABOUT WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE WHERE THEY WERE GOING SUGGESTING THAT THEY WERE COMING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM THIS KIND OF NUDGE NUDGE WINK WINK XENOPHOBIC RACES CAMPAIGN MAY BE POLITICALLY SAVVY POLITICALLY USEFUL IN THE SHORT TERM BUT IT CAUSES LONG TERM DAMAGE TO COMMUNITIES
IT'S WHY EVEN DURING THE MAYORAL CAMPAIGN I CALLED OUT MY OWN SIDE SAYING THAT THIS KIND OF DIVISIVE TOXIC POLITICS IN BRITAIN MUST NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SEE A MAYOR WHO WAS A CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE IT WAS A RELIEF THAT THAT CAMPAIGN DID NOT SUCCEED IT IS TIME FOR POLITICIANS TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE PART OF AN ENVIRONMENT OF HATE IN THIS COUNTRY
WHERE WE SAY THINGS AND WE DO THINGS AND WE ENDORSE PAUL'S POSTERS WHICH MAKE PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY FEEL LIKE THEY DO NOT BELONG AND CREATE DIVISION JUST HATE BETWEEN COMMUNE IT'S JUST FINALLY AND SPECIFICALLY ON ON YOUR COMMITMENT PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN ARE DEAD OR DOMINIC COMING SIR VOTE LEAVE SPECIFICALLY ASK YOU TO TAKE PART IN A BIG BREAKS THAT RALLY AND YOU DECLINED
I HAD A VERY CLEAR CONVERSATION IN WHICH I SAID THAT I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE NOW BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE VAULT LEAVE CAMPAIGN WHO WERE TAKING THE MESSAGE
OF WHAT TO VOTE TO LEAVE STOOD FOR DOWN A PATH WHICH I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE VISION THAT ME AND OTHER BRECK SITTERS WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED RIGHT FROM THE OUTSET WHO HAD A POSITIVE OUTWARD LOOKING VISION OF WHAT A BRECHT'S IT WOULD MEAN UNFORTUNATELY THOSE MODERATE VOICES HAVE NOW BEEN STIFLED AND WHAT WE SEE IS A DIVISIVE CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS RESULTED IN PEOPLE LIKE ME AND OTHERS WHO ARE DEEPLY EUROSCEPTIC I WANT TO SEE A REFORMED RELATIONSHIP FEEL THAT THEY NOW HAVE TO LEAVE LEAVE
BERNICE FUSSY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW IMAGINE YOU WERE TWELVE AGAIN THE NAME TEDDY TABLETS WILL BE PRETTY APPEALING WOULDN'T IT THESE TEDDY TABLETS THOUGH OR NOT SWEETS THEY'RE DANGEROUS DRUGS ECSTASY TO BE PRECISE AND THREE YOUNG GIRLS ALL AGED TWELVE
I KNOW IN HOSPITAL HAVING TAKEN THEM IN SALFORD WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY PROFESSOR FIONA MISSION AS SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE MISUSE OF DRUGS AND FOUNDER OF A DRUGS CHARITY CALLED THE LOOP MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR GOOD MORNING NOW
PEOPLE WILL BE SHOCKED BY THE AGE THEY'LL BE SHOT BY THE TITLE BUT ARE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S INVOLVED IN THIS DAY BY DAY ARE YOU SURPRISED OR YOUNG PEOPLE BEING TARGETED IN THIS WAY ALL THE TIME
I'M NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISED THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A TREND AT THE MOMENT IN YOUTH FRIENDLY IF WE CAN CALL THAT YOU FRIENDLY BRANDING OF THESE TABLETS SO WE SING TEDDY BEARS MICKEY MOUSE DARTH VADER R. TWO D. TWO BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE TRENDS IN THIS BRANDING AND WE ALSO HAVE THINGS LIKE LUXURY ADULT BRANDING LOUIS FUTON MERCEDES AND ROLLS ROYCE ARE ALSO SOME OF THE TYPES OF ECSTASY TABLETS AND HOW OFTEN I MEAN OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW IN THIS CASE YES BUT HOW OFTEN TO KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWELVE
NO THAT THEY'RE TAKING A DANGEROUS DRUG OR AT LEAST DRUG ECSTASY JUST LIKE THE TITLE AND HOW OFTEN ARE THEY COMPLETELY MISLED AS TO WHAT THEY'RE BUYING AND WE USUALLY SEE PEOPLE START TO EXPERIMENT WITH ECSTASY AT THE AGE OF SORT OF FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND ITS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTIES SO FESTIVALS NIGHT CLIPS AND ADULT PARTIES SO THIS IS VERY VERY YOUNG SO THIS IS UNUSUAL BUT WE DON'T YET KNOW I THINK WHETHER THEY INTENTIONALLY TOOK THE TABLETS OR WHETHER THEY WERE MIXED INTO A DRINK AND PERHAPS BUY WITH THEM
ANOTHER ICE IN BOOTS SERIOUSLY MORE DANGER BECAUSE OF THEIR YOUNG AGE AND PRESUMING BECAUSE THEIR BODIES BEING SMALLER AND LESS ABLE TO TACKLE A CERTAIN DOSE OF DRUG YES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THOSE PILLS CAN CONTAIN UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLIGRAMS OF ECSTASY WHICH IS THREE TIMES AN ADULT DOSE SO THEY'LL BE SMALLER THEY'LL HAVE A LOWER BODY MASS INDEX
WILL BE ADDED VULNERABILITY OF THEIR AGE AND ALSO THEY WILL HAVE A LOWER TOLERANCE ECSTASY PRODUCES RACE TOLERANCE QUITE QUICKLY SO IF THEY'VE NEVER HAD THE DRUG BEFORE THEN I HAVE A VERY LOW TOLERANCE TO THE DRUG AS WELL AND IN THE PAST WHEN WE HEARD OF PEOPLE BEING SERIOUSLY ILL OR WORSE STILL DYING AS A RESULT OF ECSTASY IT'S OFTEN BEEN DUE TO DEHYDRATION ISN'T IT BEING IN A HOT SWEATY CLUB NOT DRINKING ENOUGH AND SO ON SO IF OF NOT THE CASE IN THE CASE OF THESE GIRLS
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT SO SHE'S A YOUTH OF LOW B.M.I. POP POSSIBLY AN INDIVIDUAL FACTOR BUT NOT THE SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT YOU OUTLINE THERE AND DO YOU NOW NEED TO CHANGE THE MESSAGING TO GET TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE THAT MUCH YOUNGER TO EXPLAIN TO THEM MIGHTY HARD TO SAY TO A CHILD NEVER EVER EVER EXPERIMENT WITH THE DRUG BUT TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE BEING ASKED TO TAKE
ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WEAK HOW WE COME ABOUT THAT EDUCATION THERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TRADITIONAL DRUGS EDUCATION HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL BUT WHAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS A SORT OF LIFE SKILLS PROGRAMMES SO THAT YOU EMPHASISE HEALTHY LIVING WELL BEING SELF CONFIDENCE AND WAS A SELF DETERMINATION SO IF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFFERED DRUGS THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO FEEL THEY HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO SAY NO PROFESSOR MISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THANK YOU NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE HEARD EARLIER CARMAKERS VIEW OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE BE ECONOMY MOTOR ALONG REGARDLESS OF HER LEAVE TANYA HAS MORE ANARCHIC BUSINESS UPDATE TANYA YES GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN MICHELLE WILL EARLIER AS HE SAY MIGHT CAUSE OF THE S. T. THE MOTOR MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION TOLD US THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD JEOPARDISE THE CAR INDUSTRIES CONTINUED SUCCESS WITH ME IS JOHN LONGWORTH FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
AND NOW CHAIRMAN OF THE VOTE LEAVE BUSINESS COUNSEL GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO BADLY YOU DISAGREE
YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE NET CONTRIBUTION THAT WE PAY IN TO BE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB COMBINED WITH JESS SAVING TEN PER CENT OF THE REGULATOR ECOSSE BRANNAM WOULD GIVE US AN INITIAL ONE POT ONE PERCENT G.D.P. GROWTH AND IT WITHOUT IT WE'D GET SOME TARIFFS WITHOUT ANY WITHOUT ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT IN RETURN WE GET TARIFFS AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT FLOW NOT NECESSARILY JUST LET ME ANSWER THE POINT
TWO THINGS ONE IS THE AVERAGE TARIFF IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THREE POINT SIX PERCENT TO SURROUNDING ARAB CURRENCY MOVEMENT WE'VE ALREADY THEM COACHES MOVE FIVE PER CENT OF ALL ELIMINATED THAT SINCE LAST OCTOBER AND THE SECOND THING IS OF COURSE THE SINGLE MARKET IS IN NIRVANA IT'S A MIRAGE TOO MUCH A PROTECTIONIST AREA WE'D BE ABLE TO MOVE THE EXTERNAL BARRIERS REDUCE THE COST OF CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR REDUCE THE COST OF
FOOD PRODUCTS WE CAN'T PRODUCE IN THE U.K. BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE NEW PUPS TERRACE UP TO THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH WE HAVE TO PAY FOR RIGHT BUT WHEN WE I'M JUST LOOKING NOW AT THE AUTO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY RELIES VERY MUCH ON FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR WITHIN THE E.U. WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL OF ROUNDING ERROR MIGHT CAUSE SAYS HIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MARGINS ARE VERY TIGHT WELL LOOK THE MOTOR INDUSTRY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF INDUSTRY IN A SENSE IT HAS A TEN PER CENT
TERRY IF FROM CARS OUTSIDE THE E.U. BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS THE BIGGEST POWER RANGER IN THE EUROPEAN UNION GERMANY OF COURSE EXPORT WAY MORE CARS TO THE U.K. THAN WEEDY THOUSAND SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE ERECTION OF TARIFFS BECAUSE IT WOULD DAMAGE THEIR OWN INDUSTRY DID SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT AND EVEN IF THEY DID IT IN A MOMENT OF MADNESS THEY DID WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
GERMAN CARS WILL BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BY A FEW LESS AND WE END UP BY MORE BRITISH PRODUCE KARTS LET'S MOVE ON TO OTHER SECTORS THE CONSENSUS APPEARS WITHIN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS COMMUNITY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE O.E.C.D. THE I.M.F. THE BANK OF ENGLAND MANY MANY BUSINESSES EVEN RICHARD BRANSON OVERNIGHT CAME OUT AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE
BRITAIN TO STAY YOU SEEM AT ODDS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HOW IS IT PARTICULARLY WITH YOUR BACKGROUND NO ON THE CONTRARY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY'S VERY DIVIDED ON THIS ISSUE THE FEDERATION SMALL BUSINESSES WAS PRACTICALLY FIFTY FIFTY THE BRITISH TERMS A MY OLD OUTFIT PRODUCED A REPORT RECENTLY THAT SHOWED THAT COMPANIES THAT EXPORT ONLY OUTSIDE THE E.U. AND ONLY OPERA OR ANDOR ONLY OPERATE IN THE U.K. THAT'S EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE ECONOMY NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF BUSINESSES
WERE ACTUALLY MAJORITY IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TOWARDS LEAVING AND THE REASON FOR THAT OF COURSE IS THAT THEY KNOW THAT IT COSTS MONEY THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE CLUB THE SINGLE MARKET IS ACTUALLY OUT IT OUTWEIGHS MASSIVELY ANY BENEFITS THE SINGLE MARKET PROVIDES SO WOULD DISAGREE THAT THERE IS ANY MOMENTUM BEHIND REFORM IN THE E.U. AND PROPOSE REALLY A LEAP IN THE DARK WE HAD BEEN
IN BUSINESS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR DUMPERS EVERY CONTINENT IN THE WORLD APART FROM ANTARCTICA I'VE BEEN GOING TO BRUSSELS FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS WATCHING THEM HAVING THEIR CHAMPAGNE LUNCHES AND THE TRUTH THE MATTER IS THERE IS NO APPETITE IN EUROPEAN UNION FOR REFORM EVER MEANINGFUL NATURE WE SAW THAT BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER CAME BACK WITH A PATHETIC SET OF NEGOTIATIONS AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY WOULD ARGUE THEY WERE START IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT IT'S A POLITICAL PROJECT
THE LAW HAD OMITTED THAT BAROSS OR ON A STAGE LAST WEEK WITH ME THE FORMER PRESENT FOR YOU PINK AND SHE WAS VERY CLEAR IT'S A POLITICAL PROJECT WITH AN ECONOMIC PROJECT TACKED ON THE SIDE WORKS WITH SHUTTLING OURSELVES TO EAT DEAD CARCASS WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND EMBRACED THE WORLD JOHN NORMA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT TINY FOR SOME FOOTBALL IS SIMPLY A GAME BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF ENGLAND WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND JUST NOW HE COULD BE IN NO DOUBT THAT HE CAN ALSO SHAPE NOT JUST YOUR MOOD BUT THE NATIONAL MOOD AS WELL

OF BEING CUT AND AUTHORITIES THERE'LL BE LOTS OF ENGLAND HERE TODAY WILL BE POLICE ALL OVER AND I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU THAT'S NOT THE E.U.
WHY THE ENGLISH OF THE SEA OR EUROPE ISN'T AS PART OF THAT EUROPEAN FAMILY EUROPEANS DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR DRINKING CULTURE I'M GOING OUTSIDE FOR

OH SOME BELIEVE FOOTBALL HAS FORM WHEN IT COMES TO INFLUENCING POLITICS THEY CITE THE NINETEEN SEVENTY WORLD CUP
FOUR DAYS AFTER WEST GERMANY KNOCKED OUT ENGLAND WE HAD A GENERAL ELECTION I WOULDN'T HESITATE ON THIS EVIDENCE YOU SAY THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT IS THE FREEDOM THAT EDWARD HEATH AS AN EX PRIME MINISTER OF THE COUNTRY

WHAT OF THE LEAF AND REMAIN WOULDA LAST SIXTEEN THAT INCLUDED NORTHERN IRELAND WALES OR ENGLAND HELP OR HINDER
CIARAN MAGUIRE IS A FOOTBALL FINANCE EXPERT AT LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY HE BUYS INTO THE IDEA OF A FEELGOOD FACTOR INFLUENCING POLITY
BECAUSE THE SCENT OF SUCCESS IN EUROPE AND INCLUSIVITY WOULD IMPACT ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPSET
HE IS THERE THAT SENSE OF INCLUSIVITY BUT THIS
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I CUP AT THE WORLD CUP IN GERMANY THE SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS WAS TANGIBLE ONE ENGLISH FENDER BACK SLUG HIS ARMOUR

I'M GETTING KEEGAN MATES FOR THE IMMENSE DEPARTMENT AT WORTHING HOSPITAL
LAST WEEK MISSUS C. CAME THROUGH THE DOORS OF CATHERINE KEEGAN'S DEPARTMENT A TYPICAL PATIENT ELDERLY FRAIL BROUGHT BY AMBULANCE FROM HER CARE HOME
HE WAS OVERSEAS SCENE AND ASSESS THE AMBULANCE CREW HAND OVER TO MY NURSE IN CHARGE WHO IDENTIFIED THAT DESPITE HER RECTAL BLEEDING HER PARENTS SHE HAD NO PAIN AT ALL
HE WAS QUITE PALE SHE HAD A DEGREE OF TACHYCARDIA HAVE A FASTER HEART RATE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED INTO ONE OF OUR CUBICLES IN A MAJORS AREA
THREE HOURS AND SEVERAL TESTS LATER THIS IS C. WAS MOVED ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO THE EMERGENCY FLOOR THIS IS AN INNOVATION OR WALK IN CARE CENTRE
AND SIXTY SEVEN BEDS FOR MEDICAL SURGICAL OR FRAIL PATIENTS ROGER DUCKETT IS CLINICAL DIRECTOR FOR ACUTE MEDICINE AT WEST SUSSEX SO FOR PATIENTS IT MEANS THAT THEY GET PUT INTO HER BED
THEY GET THE TEAM COMING TO THEM THEY DON'T NEED TO MOVE AND THEY GET THE RIGHT TREATMENT IN THE RIGHT PLACE AS FAST AS POSS
WE OPERATED A SEVENTY TWO HOUR
TIME OF STEAK USUALLY AND EVER SINCE WE OPENED AND AMY IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THAT THEY COULD FEEL THAT PATIENTS WERE STAYING IN THE ONLY DEPARTMENT FOR LIST
AS PATIENTS MOVE ON TO THE EMERGENCY FLOOR THERE'S SPACE IN CATHERINE KEEGAN'S WARD SO IT'S RARE FOR AMBULANCES TO QUEUE UP OUTSIDE NEARLY A THIRD OF ALL PATIENTS ARE TREATED IN THE CARE CENTRE AND DON'T STAY OVERNIGHT BUT THE MISSUS C. WAS GIVEN A BED
AT FIRST DOCTORS THOUGHT SHE NEEDS SURGERY THEN THEY DECIDED SHE DIDN'T BUT SHE WASN'T MOVED FROM ONE WAR TO ANOTHER THE TEAMS SWAPPED INSTEAD
TIME IS CRUCIAL FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS THE LONGER THEY STAY IN HOSPITAL THE MORE THEY MOVE AROUND THE MORE DEBILITATED THEY BECOME THE HARDER IT IS TO SEND THEM HOME
THE LADY IN FIFTY SEVEN THIS IS SEES A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD SHE CAME IN WITH DILL AREA SHE'S GOT A BACKGROUND OF DEMENTIA AND SHE HAD SOME
RECTAL BLEEDING DOCTOR DAVID HUNT GERIATRIC CONSULTANT ON THE EMERGENCY FLOOR ASSESSING MISSUS SIMMONS CONDITION WITH DOCTORS NURSES PHYSIOTHERAPISTS OR LOCAL AUTHORITY SOCIAL WORKERS THIS IS THE DAILY MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM MEETING AS SOON AS PATIENTS COME IN THIS TEAM START WORKING OUT WHEN THEY CAN LEAVE SAFELY
SHE'S FINE SHE'S SHE'S SLEEPING AFTER HAVING HAD BREAKFAST BUT SHE'S PAINFULLY SHE'S COMFORTABLE AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO
ULTIMATELY WE COULD HAVE SENT HER HOME IF SHE HAD DIARRHOEA BUT BECAUSE OF THE INFECTION RISK WE WOULDN'T RIP A TRAITOR TOO
BACK TO HER CARE HOME WITHOUT HER DIARY AT HAVING SETTLED MISSUS C. WENT HOME THE NEXT DAY AFTER THREE NIGHTS
TWO YEARS AGO IT WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT SO PRIOR TO OPENING THE EMERGENCY FLOOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ADMITTED FROM EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO A SURGICAL WARD
WE'VE GOT THE SAME SURGICAL CARE BUT THE TRANSITION OF CARE FROM SURGERY TO CARE OF ELDERLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS SLICK AS EFFECTIVE AND WE WOULD HAVE GOT A ROOM REFERRAL WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE JUNIORS PROBABLY THE NEXT MORNING TO GO AND SEE
AND IT MAY WELL NOT HAVE BEEN ON THAT SAME DAY THAT SHE WAS REVIEWED SO THE PROCESS IS MUCH FASTER
THE EMERGENCY FLOOR IS A BIG IDEA A SMALLER ONE IS KEEPING A PATIENT'S HOME CARING PLACE FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER THEY'RE ADMITTED
IN THE PAST THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WOULD CUT THAT IMMEDIATELY AND ONCE THE PATIENT HAD BEEN TREATED IT TOOK THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO PUT IT BACK SO THE PATIENT WOULD BE STUCK IN HOSPITAL
GEORGE FINDLAY IS THE TRUST'S MEDICAL DIRECTOR IT'S A STUNNING EFFECT FOR A TINY SMALL INTERVENTION AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE MEAN THAT THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLETS ARE FIX THIS IT'S HARD WORK AND IT'S ATTENTION TO DETAIL WHEN IT'S LOTS OF LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS THE BRITISH CYCLING TEAMS MARGINAL GAINS THEORY I'VE GOT TO DO LOTS OF LITTLE THINGS WELL AND I LIKE DOCTOR A BIG IMPROVEMENT
LISTENING TO THAT MARION GRIFFITHS WHO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WESTERN SUSSEX HOSPITALS N.H.S. TRUST FASCINATING TO HEAR THAT NOTION OF TINY INCREMENTAL CHANGES MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE
A GOOD MORNING NICK YES INDEED IT IS AND FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE TOO LIKE MOST OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE N.H.S. HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ATTENDANCES IN ADMISSIONS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE DID RECOGNISE THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP SERVICES SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE THAT WE NEEDED TO CONCENTRATE ON IMPROVING MANY THINGS
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING IS OBVIOUSLY FIRST OF ALL THE CREATION OF OUR EMERGENCY FLOORS BOTH IN WORTHING AND INDEED CHICHESTER AND THOSE HAVE CULMINATED IN US BEING ABLE TO REDUCE THE OVER TWENTY FOUR HOUR ADMISSIONS IN SURGERY BY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT FIGURE IS THAT IT MEANS IT RELEASES ADDITIONAL BEDS SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE DO NEED THEM WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADMIT SO IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT INITIATIVE AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCE YOU'VE DONE A DEAL WITH A LOCAL AUTHORITY AS WELL WE HAVE AND AGAIN I THINK WE'RE IN A FORTUNATE SITUATION WE JUST HAVE ONE LOCAL AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THREE HOSPITALS
AND WE HAVE MANAGED TO PERSUADE OUR COLLEAGUES AND INDEED THEY ABSOLUTELY RECOGNISE THE BENEFIT OF IT THAT WHEN A PATIENT IS ADMITTED AND COMES FROM HAVING HAD A HOME CARE PACKAGE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY PROTECTED FOR THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT HOURS PREVIOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE IF A PERSON WAS TO BE DISCHARGING A PATIENT TO BE DISCHARGED AFTER TWO DAYS IT COULD TAKE POTENTIALLY UP TO ANOTHER ANOTHER THREE DAYS IN HOSPITAL FOR THAT PATIENT TO BE DISCHARGED
WE DO KNOW THAT EVERY DAY IN HOSPITAL PUTS BACK PATIENTS' REHABILITATION BY ABOUT TWO WEEKS EVERY DAY MATTERS I'M AFRAID WE'RE A BIT SHORT OF TIME BUT WE YOU BEGAN BY STRESSING THE PRESSURE'S ON YOU AND OTHER HOSPITALS I THINK YOU'RE PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE ACHIEVED AT WORTHING BUT A BIT NERVOUS IF ANYBODY HOLD YOU UP AS EVIDENCE THAT MONEY IS REALLY WHAT MATTERS IT'S PURELY MANAGEMENT
I THINK I THINK THINGS ARE COMPLICATED IN THE N.H.S. WHICH I WOULD SAY IS THAT MAINTAINING A HIGH MORALE AND A POSITIVE CULTURE IS JUST AS EQUAL AS MONEY IN THE SITUATION AND I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT EYE STUFF COME TO WORK IN ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS
TO DO A GOOD JOB BECAUSE SOMETIMES THINGS GET IN THE WAY IT'S OUR JOB AS LEADERS AND MANAGERS TO HELP REMOVE THOSE BLOCKS THAT ENABLE THEM TO DELIVER THE SAFEST AND BEST CARE THEY CAN
MARION GRIFFITHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EAT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE FINANCIAL TIME SAYS THE MURDER OF THE M.P. JOE COX HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE TERMS OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE THE PAPER BELIEVES DAVID CAMERON INVOKED HER MEMORY TO PRESS HIS CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. BY TWEETING A LINK TO AN ARTICLE ON MIGRATION SHE WROTE SHORTLY BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED ACCORDING TO THE F.T. SUSPENDING THE CAMPAIGN LAST WEEK HAS HELPED REMAIN AND POLITICIANS AS WELL AS FINANCIAL MARKETS
ARE MAKING COLD CALCULATIONS ABOUT HOW HER KILLING WILL AFFECT THE RESULT THE GUARDIAN REPEAL PORTS THAT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ARE FURIOUS THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS SOUGHT TO EMPHASISE MISSUS COX'S PRO E.U. VIEWS THE SON SAYS IN ITS LEADER COLUMN THE FOLLOWING HER MURDER THERE'S BEEN A DEPLORABLE MOVE BY SOME REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS TO EXPLOIT A NATION STILL IN MOURNING THE PAPER THAT MY IMMIGRATION IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO VOTE LEAVE THIS WEEK
ONTO A KIND CARING AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY HERE THEY FACE UNFAIR ACCUSATIONS OR BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE OF HER MANUS
MALLING OVER FAILURE TO CURB E.U. MIGRATION IS THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE VERDICT OF DAVID CAMERON'S PERFORMANCE ON B. B. C. ONES QUESTION TIME LAST NIGHT THE PAPER'S POLITICAL SKETCH WRITER QUENTIN LETTS SAYS THAT A MORE SOMBRE EVENT WAS EXPECTED FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF JOE COX THE COLUMNIST FELT THE PRIME MINISTER SNAPPED AT THE AUDIENCE AND THE MALES EDITORIAL ADDS THAT MISTER CAMERON BECAME VISIBLY SHAKEN AFTER A MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE TOLD HIM THE REFORM DEAL HE NEGOTIATED WITH OTHER E.U. LEADERS HAD MADE HIM A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN
THAT WAS THE PAPER SAYS PERHAPS THE UNKIND US CUT THE TIMES CALLED IT A BRUISING DEBATE TERMINATOR MATTHEW GIANCANA WRITING IN THE GUARDIAN AND HE RATES MISTER CAMERON'S PERFORMANCE AS THE BEST OF THE CAMPAIGN AND EVA BATTLE RALLYING CRY HE CALLS IT WHICH CONNECTED WITH THE AUDIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN HE DECLARED HE DIDN'T THINK BRITAIN IS A QUITTER
FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE PRIME MINISTER MADE HIS MOST PASSIONATE INTERVENTION YET WHEN HE COMPARED HIS FIGHT TO STAY IN THE E.U. WITH WINSTON CHURCHILL'S BATTLE AGAINST THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS MY CAMERON CAME OUT FIGHTING
FINALLY A NEW PAPERS ARRIVE TWENTY FOUR THE NORTH'S NATIONAL IT'S FOR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND IN THE SCOTTISH BORDERS IT WILL TAKE A NORTHERN PERSPECTIVE ON THE NATION'S NEWS IN THE MAIN STORY ON ITS FIRST FRONT PAGE IS A REPORT ON FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM WITH PAPER FIGURES SHOWING THAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY HAS BEEN BANNED FROM MATCHES WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT IT'S NOT THE IDEAL
TIME TO BE LAUNCHING GIVEN THAT ANOTHER NEWSPAPER THE NEW DAY FOLDED IN MARCH BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM CARLISLE OR BY DAVID HENRY WELL WHO'S THE EDITORIAL DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLISHERS OF TWENTY FOUR C. N. GROUP GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT WILL READERS OF A TWENTY FOUR GUESS ON A DAY BY DAY BIT MAKE THEIR BASES THAT IS NOT BEING OFFERED ELSEWHERE
WELL WE HOPE THEY WILL GET A GREAT MIX OF ALL OF THE BEST NATIONAL NEWS AND SPORT CONTENT THAT IS HE'S AROUND BUT AS YOU SAY ADDED WITH A BIT OF A NORTHERN FLAVOUR AS WELL
OBVIOUSLY THIS WEEK IS A HUGE WEEK IN TERMS OF NEWS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE MURDER OF JILL COX WITH THE EUROPEAN VOTE ON THURSDAY AND WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AT AT THE EUROS FOR THE FOOTBALL AS WELL
CLEARLY ALL THAT WILL BE PART OF A MIX BUT HAS ALONGSIDE THAT WE WILL BE MAKING SURE THAT THE VERY BEST OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WILL ALSO BE COVERED SO THERE'S MORE AND MORE STORIES OF RELEVANCE IN THERE TO PEOPLE OF THIS AREA WHAT WOULD A NORTHERN FLAVOUR ON A NATIONAL NEWS STORY LOOK LIKE
IT'S DIFFERENT THINGS REALLY SO IN TERMS OF A COMPLETELY NATIONAL STORY SUCH AS SAY THE THE ONES COME OUT EVERY FEW DAYS ABOUT THE NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE IT WAS MET IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS WRITTEN FROM A NORTHERN SPY PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN FROM THE SOUTH EAST PERSPECTIVE AND GENERALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN AT THE MOMENT
NO I DON'T THINK IT DOES NOW I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WE WILL BE OFFERING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND I THINK IN TERMS OF SPORT IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE CONCENTRATE ON THE TEAMS AT THE MOST POPULAR IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD SO THE MANCHESTER UNITED'S IN THE LIVERPOOL'S RATHER THAN THE THE CHELSEA'S AND THE ARSENALS AND I THINK IT'S ALSO JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE NOT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT HAPPENS IN THE U.K. THE ONLY A FRACTION OF IT GETS INTO A INTO A NEWSPAPERS AND IT'S IT CAN BE VERY SOUTH DOMINATED SO FOR INSTANCE
RATHER THAN COVERING COURT CASES FROM SAY CAMBRIDGE IN NORWICH THEY WERE THEY WOULD BE CASES THAT HAPPENED IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND THAT'S JUST REALLY ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE INTEND TO DO IT IS QUITE BRAVE OF YOU TO DO THIS SO SOON AFTER THAN THE NEW DAY FOLDED IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF WEEKS THAT THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE
YEAH BUT I MEAN THAT IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A NEWSPAPER I MEANT
WE IN THE U.K. LOVE OUR NEWSPAPERS WE STILL BUY THEM BY THE MILLION SO THERE IS PLENTY OF LIFE STILL LEFT IN THAT MARKET AND WHAT WE OBVIOUSLY THINK IS WE OFFER SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT A MODEL IS VERY DIFFERENT TO NEW DAY'S SPORT WILL BE A BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO WON'T WE BELIEVE IN YOU KNOW HARD NEWS WERE STILL SELLS NEWSPAPERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT AND ONLY SIX JOURNALISTS PUTTING THE PAPER OUT IS THAT RIGHT YOU'VE ONLY GOT A TEAM OF HALF A DOZEN
WELL WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM OF HALF A DOZEN DOING THIS BUT WE ARE SEEING GROUP WE HAVE WE EMPLOY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED JOURNALISTS AND WHEN CAN OBVIOUSLY CALL ON THAT STRENGTH
MOST OF OUR CONTENT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE PRESS ASSOCIATION WHO WERE THE U.K.'S LEADING AGENCIES SO THEY HAVE JOURNALISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS ALL OVER THE U.K. AND LINKS ALL ROUND THE WORLD SO WHILE IT'S A VERY SMALL DEDICATED TEAM IN TERMS OF HANDS ON PRODUCTION OF TWENTY FOUR THEY ARE BACKED BY ONE OF THE BIGGEST NEWSROOMS IN THE COUNTRY
DAVID HAD A WELL GOOD LUCK WITH IT IT'S THE FIRST DAY OFT OF TWENTY FOUR VERY BEST OF LUCK THANKS FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU TIME NOW IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS FRANCIS CAMPBELL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICK GOOD MORNING MICHELLE
REGARDLESS OF HOW ILLUSTRIOUS OUR LIVES IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THE SERMON OF OUR FUNERAL WILL TAKE NO LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES
A LIFE SUMMED UP IN FIVE MINUTES SOBERING ISN'T IT WHEN WE APPLY IT TO OUR OWN LIVES WHAT WE OFTEN PUT OURSELVES AT THE CENTRE
SO HOW WOULD WE SUM UP OUR LIVES TODAY IF WE WERE GIVEN FIVE MINUTES IN WHICH TO DO SO WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT AND WHAT WOULD BE IRRELEVANT HOW WOULD WE WANT TO BE REMEMBER
FOR SOME IT MIGHT BE HOT WE HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT WE HAVE LEFT BEHIND FOR OTHERS IT MIGHT BE SIMPLY HIGH WE WERE
ONE FRIEND SAID TO ME THAT WHEN THINKING OF DEATH HE CAME TO THE VIEW THAT WE SPENT FAR TOO MUCH OF OUR LIVES SEEKING THE NINE IT'S RATHER THAN THE ADJECTIVES AND THE VERBS
IN OTHER WORDS OUR LIVES SEEM TO PURSUE ROLES AS IF THEY HAD TO FIND US I'M IN TO TEMPORAL SENSE THEY DO AS DORIES AND LIFE CAN OPEN OR CLOSE ON THE BASIS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S POSITION AND SOCIETY BUT SHOULD THAT BE THE KISS
FOR CHRISTIANS AND FROM MANY OTHER RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS CLEARLY NOT AS THE TEMPORAL WORLD AS ONE WHICH ARE SIMPLY PASSING AND FINITE IT IS NOT THE NOUNS THAT BRING REDEMPTION OR ETERNAL SALVATION TO A RELIGIOUS BELIEVER IT DOES THE ADJECTIVES IN THE VERBS THE WORDS THAT DESCRIBE HOW WE WERE AND WHAT WE DID NOT WHAT WE WERE
TODAY'S RECALL OF PARLIAMENT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO JOE COX AND THE GLOWING PRAISE FOR HER AND RECENT DAHLIAS HAS BROUGHT THAT INTO SHARP FOCUS
BUT IT IS NOT JUST OUR LIVES THAT WILL BE SUMMED UP IN FIVE MINUTES THIS ERA IN WHICH WE NOW LIVE IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE SUMMED UP IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS WHEN FUTURE GENERATIONS COME TO LEARN ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY COME FROM THEIR HISTORY
WHAT WILL THEY LEARN ABOUT US WHAT JUDGEMENTS WERE THEY MAKE ABOUT HOW WE FIERCE THE CHALLENGERS A FORAGE WILL THEY SAY THAT WE CARE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE TO THE ADJECTIVES AND VERBS OR THE NINE WILL SEE OUR ERA AS A REMARKABLE ONE WHICH ROSE TO THE CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGE US AND TO THE HEIGHTS OF HUMAN OF TOURISM
A ONE WHICH SUNK TO THE BS OF NARROW SELF INTEREST
WHAT WHEN A COLLECTIVE SOCIETY A SOCIETAL LEGACY BE
WILL FUTURE HISTORIANS DESCRIBED THIS AS A HIGH POINT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN CIVILISATION OR SOMETHING LESS NOBLE WHICH WE SQUANDERED DESPITE ALL OUR MATERIAL ON CULTURAL ADVANTAGES
A FIVE MINUTE SUMMARY SS WHETHER APPROACHED AS INDIVIDUAL SORROW AS A SOCIETY SHOULD STRIVE TO BRING OUT THE BEST OF OUR HUMANITY NOT THE WORST
MORE OF A FOCUS ON HOW WE WERE AND NOT WHAT WE WERE WOULD HELP
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH FRANCIS CAMPBELL THE DINERS TEN TO EIGHT IN HER SHORT TIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS JOE COX NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF PARLIAMENT BEING RECALLED THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE ISSUE WAS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE SHE HAD NOT YET BEEN ELECTED OVER THE YEARS THE RECALL OF PARLIAMENT FROM A RECESS HAS BEEN USED ON OCCASIONS SUCH AS A ROYAL DEATH TERRORISM CIVIL DISORDER AND WALL
I'M SURE I'D HAVE THE WHOLE HOUSE WILL JOIN ME IN CONDEMNING TOTALLY UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA AGAINST BRITISH TERRITORY
I'M OPPOSED TO A WAR AGAINST
I AM OPPOSED TO ACTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED NATIONS I BELIEVE IT WOULD DIVIDE THE SECURITY
I BELIEVE IT MIGHT NOT EXACTLY YOU UNITE ARAB WORLD THAT MIGHT BRING MANY ARAB COUNTRIES TOGETHER
AND I THINK THE OUTCOME OF SUCH A WAR COULD NOT BE SURE
WE WILL NOT FORGET THE HORROR OF OMAN
BUT I SAY THIS TO THOSE THAT PERPETRATED THAT OUTBREAK YOU SOUGHT DIRECT THE AGREEMENT AND YOU FAIL
I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE NEED FOR A TOUGH RESPONSE TO THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN RESPECTING THE WILL OF THIS HOUSE
IT IS VERY CLEAR TONIGHT WHILE THE HOUSE HAS NOT PASSED A MOTION IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT REFLECTING THE VIEWS OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE BRITISH MILITARY ACTION
WELL ON THIS OCCASION EM PEAS WILL SPEAK OF ONE OF THEIR OWN THERE WILL BE TRIBUTES TO AND MEMORIES OF JOE COCK STARTING AT HALF PAST TWO THIS AFTERNOON AND THERE'LL BE LIVE COVERAGE ON THE B.B.C. NEWS CHANNEL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE LABOUR PEER BARONESS CHILD TESSA JOWELL AND BY MARY RIDDELL WHO WRITES FOR THE TELEGRAPH AND HE WAS A FRIEND OF JOE COX GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING BURN ESTELLE USEFUL QUITE A FEW RECORDS IN YOUR TIME AS AN M. P. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU
TO TALK ABOUT SOMEONE LIKE JOE COX IN THAT SETTING I THINK FIRST OF ALL TO SHOW LOVE AND RESPECT TO HER TO THE CONTRIBUTION THAT SHE MADE AND FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO COME TOGETHER
AND JUST REFLECT ON THEIR OWN FRIENDSHIP RELATIONSHIP ENCOUNTERS WITH JOE I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THING SHE IS ABSOLUTELY AT THE CENTRE OF THIS I THINK THERE'S A SECOND POINT WHICH IS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE RESILIENT DECENCY OF PARLIAMENT
THAT THIS AFTERNOON BUT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WILL TRAVEL FROM TRAVEL FROM THEIR CONSTITUENCIES PEOPLE WHO HELD DIFFERENT VIEWS TO THOSE THAT JOE HELD SO DEAR TO MARK AND CELEBRATE HER CONTRIBUTION AND I THINK THAT THAT RESILIENCE OF PARLIAMENT IS IMPORTANT
NOT JUST FOR THE M.P.S THEMSELVES AND PIERS BECAUSE I WILL BE THERE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AS WELL BUT THE RESILIENCE OF
PARLIAMENT BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S SENDING A VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO THE WIDER PUBLIC ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE INSTITUTION THAT PARLIAMENT IS CAPABLE OF THIS KIND OF DECENCY THAT SETS ASIDE WHAT ARE VERY OFTEN PASSIONATE DE DIFFERENCES MARY RIDDELL YOU KNEW HER YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT HER DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SEE
BACKBENCH OR SIT ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE HOUSE'S AS USUAL AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED WITHOUT DOUBT I MEAN SHE WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES I'M SURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED SHE DIDN'T WANT IT OF COURSE FOR PEOPLE TOO I'M SURE SIT WHEREVER THEY WANTED IN IN HER MEMORY AND TO TALK ABOUT HER AND PAY SORT OF TRIBUTES THAT TESSA'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND OF COURSE TODAY IS ABOUT TYING THIS DECENCY CONCILIATION
ALL THE IMPULSES WE'VE SEEN SO MANY OFF AMONG PUBLIC AND POLITICIANS OVER THE LAST DAYS BUT I THINK IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE SORT OF HORROR AND MAYHEM WHICH IS OFTEN NOT UNIVERSALLY BUT WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN THE SUBJECT OF PARLIAMENTARY RECALLS A TERRIBLE OUTRAGE HAS TAKEN PLACE AGAINST A YOUNG WOMAN GOING ABOUT HER PUP PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS
IN THE SERVICE OF HER CONSTITUENTS AND OUR DEMOCRACY AND I THINK THE SORT OF FULL MOT IF YOU LIKE FOR NORA THREE OF THE OCCASION IS IMPORTANT TOO BUT OF COURSE WHAT'S SHONE THROUGH
IS JOE SEWN WONDERFUL CHARACTER HER KINDNESS AND I'M SURE THE THOSE QUALITIES WHICH OF COURSE REFLECT AND A MIRRORED IN OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE PRIMARILY ON DISPLAY TODAY TESSA TOLD HAS BEEN THE RIGHT DECISION FROM DIFFERENT DEEP FROM THE PARTIES THAT FROM THE OTHER PARTIES THAT THIS WILL NOT BE A CONTESTED A BY ELECTION AT LEAST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THE MAIN PARLIAMENTARY PARTY
YES I DO AND I THINK AS PART OF THE SAME EXPRESSION OF RESPECT YOU KNOW THIS WAS ASKED IF YOU LIKE A KIND OF IT'S I MEAN IT WAS A MORTAL ASSAULT
ON WHAT SHE REPRESENTED WHAT SHE HELD DEAR WHAT SHE HAD BEEN ELECTED OVER A YEAR AT JUST OVER A YEAR AGO TO ITSELF TO IT TO HER CONSTITUENTS
AND SO I THINK AGAIN THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE MORE WIDELY WANT TO SEE FROM THEIR POLITICS NOT THE KIND OF VICIOUS PERSONAL ATTACKS BUT A RESPECT FOR THE OFFICE AND YOU KNOW JOE WAS MURDERED AND
THAT'S WHY OF PARLIAMENT IS BEING RECALLED THAT'S WHY IN TIME THERE WILL BE A BY ELECTION AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE SAID THAT THEY WON'T CONTEST THE BY ELECTION I'M SURE THAT WHEN WHOEVER
IS ELECTED IN DUE COURSE TO SUCCEED SHOW COMES TO PARLIAMENT THEY WILL ENGAGE IN EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF EXCHANGE IT'S NOT NOW THAT YOU KNOW IT IN OUR REMAINING TIME GALLE WAS MURDERED WHEN THAT BY ELECTION AFTER HIS DEATH WAS CONTESTED
YES IT WAS IAN CAROL WAS MURDERED IN AIREY NEAVE WAS MURDERED BEFORE HIM I WAS WORKING ON THE OXFORD MAIL ON THE DAY THAT HEROIN HE WAS BLOWN UP AND I REMEMBER THAT VERY VERY CAREFUL VERY VERY WELL BUT I THINK THE WOLF A SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCE
THEIRS WAS THEIRS IN A SENSE WILL SORT OF POLITICAL DEBTS THEY WERE BLOWN UP BY IRISH REPUBLICANS AND HORRIFIC AS THOSE ATTACKS WERE THEY FITTED INTO SOME KNOWN RUBRIC SOME FRAMEWORK THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD WITHIN POLITICS JEFF DEAF I THINK WAS OUT WITH THAT AND SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AND HONOURED A SUCH

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE TWENTIETH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIAN LADY VESEY HAS SAID XENOPHOBIA AND LIES HAVE FORCED HER TO ABANDON THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN AND SHE WILL NOW BACK THERE REMAIN SIDE VOTE LEAVE HAS SAID DAVID CAMERON SHOULD ABANDON THE TORY PLEDGED TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED
PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN RECALLED TO REMEMBER THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX WHO WAS SHOT AND STABBED LAST WEEK AND THE UN SAYS SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ARE NOW REFUGEES BECAUSE OF CONFLICT THE HIGHEST EVER FIGURE THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLARKSTON
THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN LADY VALESI SAYS SHE NICE SUPPORTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE CALLED THE HIT AND XENOPHOBIA OF THE LEAF SIDE SHE SAID HER MIND WAS MADE UP BY A UKIP POSTO SHOWING REFUGEES ON THE BORDER BETWEEN SLOVENIA AND CROATIA AND WHAT SHE CALLED MICHAEL GOES LIES ABOUT TURKEY'S ACCESSION TO THE E.U. VOTE LEAVE SAID IT DIDN'T REMEMBER LADY VICE EVER BEING ON ITS SIDE
OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH HAS JUST SENT THIS REPORT SIDE OF OURS HE WAS NEVER A PROMINENT SUPPORTER OF LEAVE BUT HER CRITICISM OF THE BRICKS AT CAMPAIGN IS BLUNT AND BRUISING SHE SIGHTS IN PARTICULAR THE TONE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN OVER IMMIGRATION ACCUSING THEM OF A NUDGE NUDGE WINK WINK XENOPHOBIC APPROACH
SHE ACCUSES THE LEE SIDE OF LYING OVERTAKE IS SUPPOSE IT IMMINENT ADMISSION TO THE E.U. AND CONDEMNS WHAT SHE CALLS THE INDEFENSIBLE POSTER UNVEILED BY NIGEL BARRAGE DEPICTING THE QUEUE OF MIGRANTS UNDER THE HEADLINE BREAKING POINT SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME LADY VICE SAID SHE HAD URGED THE BRICKS HAD CAMPAIGN TO ADOPT A MORE OPTIMISTIC AND INCLUSIVE APPROACH
WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE INSTINCTIVELY YOU'RE A SCEPTIC HORFIELD E. UNIS REFORM AND WHO WANT TO REBALANCE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE FEELING THAT THEY NOW HAVE TO LEAVE LEAVE BECAUSE DAY AFTER DAY WHAT ARE WE HEARING THE REFUGEES ARE COMING THE RAPISTS ARE COMING THE TURKS ARE COMING
THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN THE OFFICIAL LEAVES SIDE OF SALT TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE FROM NIGEL FIN RAJ AND OVER THE WEEKEND A SERIES A SENIOR FIGURES OPENLY CRITICISE THE UKIP POSTER AND THIS MORNING BORIS JOHNSON WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ATTACKS THOSE SEEKING TO PRESENT THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN AS HOSTILE TO OPENNESS AND TOLERANCE
THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD DROP HIS PLEDGE TO REDUCE NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR LABOUR M.P. DIESEL OR STUART SO THE TARGET WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET UNLESS THE U.K. VOTED TO LEAVE HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN
THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO MAKE ITS FINAL APPEAL ABOUT HER VOTES FOR DEMOCRACY SO IT IS PRESSING THIS POINT ON IMMIGRATION THAT PROMISING TO CONTROL THE NUMBERS YET CONSISTENTLY FAILING TO DO SO IS CORROSIVE OF PEOPLE'S TRUST IN POLITICIANS HE'S LE STUART SAID IF THEY REMAIN SIDE WON THE REFERENDUM THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD SCRAP THE TARGET TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND HE CANNOT CONTINUE TO PROMISE TO DO SOMETHING BUT HE KNOWS HE'S IMPOSSIBLE SHE SAID
ASK DURING THE B.B.C.'S QUESTION TIME ABOUT THE NUMBERS MY CAMERON CONCEDED THAT CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION WAS VERY CHALLENGING BUT SAID HIS Y. U. RENEGOTIATION WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE HE ALSO ACCUSED HIS OPPONENTS OF TELLING UNTRUTHS ABOUT TURKEY JOINING THE E.U. WITH THREE DAYS OF CAMPAIGNING LEFT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A MORE TRANQUIL TONE TO THIS DEBATE BORIS JOHNSON THANK THE REMAIN SIDE OF A DESPERATE AND INSULTING ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY BRECHT'S ITS SUPPORTERS AS OPPONENTS OF OPENNESS TOLERANCE AND DECENCY
SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CAR MANUFACTURERS INCLUDING THEIR SON JAGUAR LAND ROVER AND TOYOTA HAVE WRITTEN TO THEIR STAFF ADVISING THEM TO BACK BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE SOCIETY OF MOTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS WHICH REPRESENTS CARMAKERS IS WARNING THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD JEOPARDISE INVESTMENT IN AN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE GROUP SAYS THE SINGLE MARKET IS HUGELY BENEFICIAL
JOHN LONG WORSE IS THE FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND CHAIRS A VOTE LEAVES BUSINESS COUNCIL HE TOLD US THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY COULD SURVIVE OUTSIDE THE E.U.
GERMANY OF COURSE EXPORT WAY MORE CARS TO THE U.K. THAN WE DID FOR THEM SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE ERECTION OF TARIFFS BECAUSE IT WOULD DAMAGE THEIR OWN INDUSTRIES AND SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT AND EVEN IF THEY DID IT IN A MOMENT OF MADNESS THEY DID WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
GERMAN CARS WILL BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE WOULD BUY A FEW LESS AND WE END UP BY MORE BRITISH PRODUCE CARS
THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE HAS ALSO COME OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAINING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE MOTION WAS SUPPORTED BY ALL TWENTY OF THE LEAGUES FOOTBALL CLUBS LEAVE CAMPAIGNER SAID E.U. MEMBERSHIP REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGLISH PLAYERS AND MEANT IT WAS HARDER TO SIGN PLAYERS FROM OUTSIDE THE CONTINENT BUT THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE RICHARD SCUDAMORE SAID LEAVING WOULD SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL YOU JUST GOT TO DECIDE ARE WE BETTER BEING OPEN WE BETTER
ACTING LIKE WE WANT TO PLAY A PART IN THE WORLD AND BE WORLDLY CITIZENS
DO WE WANT TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE WORLD THAT SAYS ACTUALLY WERE KIND OF PULL IN THE DRAWBRIDGE UP HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CONTROL OF OUR OWN DESTINY WHAT THAT'S DOESN'T SEEM TO SIT VERY WELL
PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN RECALLED TODAY SO THAT POLITICIANS CAN PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX SHE WAS SHOT AND STABBED IN HER WEST YORKSHIRE CONSTITUENCY LAST THURSDAY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ELEANOR GARNIER REPORTS

BUT IT'S THOUGHT FRIENDS OF THE LATE N. P. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE WANT TO SIT TOGETHER WITH CLOSE PARTY COLLEAGUES SO NORMAL SEATING ARRANGEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING HAS SAID CONVENTIONAL PARTY POLITICS SHOULD BE A MILLION MILES AWAY
THREE TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRLS WHO BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL AFTER TAKING ECSTASY AND SALFORD ON SATURDAY AND I SAID TO BE IN A STABLE CONDITION A MAN AND A WOMAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED

BILLIONS OF POUNDS EVERY YEAR RICHARD LESTER REPORTS THE OBESITY HEALTH ALLIANCES ANALYSED A RANGE OF DATA ABOUT OUR WEIGHT AND SAYS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AROUND SEVEN IN TEN OF US WILL BE OVERWEIGHT AND OF THOSE FOUR WILL BE A PIECE

HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE SINCE LORD CARLISLE CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO YOUTH JUSTICE A DECADE AGO THE HOWARD LEAGUE REPORT SAYS THE NUMBER OF TEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS HELD IN CUSTODY HAS DROPPED SHARPLY BUT FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS REMAIN THE RATE AT WHICH STAFF USE FORCE TO RESTRAIN CHILDREN HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT SAYS THE REPORT SAYS TOO MANY BOYS ARE STILL BEING STRIP SEARCHED AND DUE TO STAFF SHORTAGES AND A RISE IN PRISON VIOLENCE
YOUNG OFFENDERS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING HELD ALONE IN THEIR CELLS IN CONDITIONS AMOUNTING TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE SAYS THE WELFARE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN ITS CARE IS ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY IT'S AWAITING THE RESULTS OF A REVIEW INTO THE YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM
THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY SAYS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DISPLACED BY CONFLICT HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN A NEW REPORT PUBLISHED ON WORLD REFUGEE DAY THE U.N. SAYS MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE EITHER REFUGEES ASYLUM SEEKERS OR INTERNALLY DISPLACED BY THE END OF LAST YEAR IMOGEN FOLKS REPORTS FROM GENEVA
WAR AND PERSECUTION CAUSED A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FORCED TO FLEE THEIR HOMES LAST YEAR OVER HALF OF ALL REFUGEES COME FROM SYRIA AFGHANISTAN AND SOMALIA MEANWHILE GERMANY RECEIVED THE MOST ASYLUM REQUESTS REFLECTING THE UN SAYS ITS READINESS TO ACCEPT REFUGEES FLEEING ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN BUT THE REFUGEE AGENCY POINTS OUT
DESPITE THE HUGE FOCUS ON EUROPE'S MIGRANT CRISIS WITH OVER A MILLION PEOPLE ARRIVING BY SEA LAST YEAR THEY ARE JUST A FRACTION OF THE GLOBAL TOTAL
EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF REFUGEES ARE BEING SHELTERED IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES THE U.N. SAYS GOVERNMENTS MUST SHOW UNITY IN THE FACE OF SUCH A VAST CRISIS NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF REFUGEES BUT IN THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN INTEREST
A NEW NEWSPAPER FOR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND SCOTTISH BORDERS HAS BEEN LAUNCHED TODAY IT'S CALLED TWENTY FOUR AND HIS ATTEMPT TO OFFER READERS A PRINTED NEWSPAPER WITH A LESS SOUTHERN PERSPECTIVE CATHY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS TEN PAST EIGHT
WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE NO EXPERT CAN GIVE YOU THE ANSWER NO FACTOR NO STATISTIC CAN HELP YOU TO FIND ONE IT IS A QUESTION A JUDGEMENT OF FEELING IF YOU LIKE FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE AND FOR MANY IT WILL BE THE KEY TO MAKING UP THEIR MINDS ON HOW TO VOTE ON THURSDAY THE PRIME MINISTER IS CLEAR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE HOPES YOU WILL VOTE TO AVOID
EVEN GIVES IT HER NAME NIGEL FARRAJ IS BRITAIN AND THIS MORNING THE FORMER TORY PARTY CHAIRMAN BARONESS VASEY HAS SWITCH SIDES IN THE E.U. DEBATE TO BACK REMAIN TELLING MICHELLE EARLIER OF HER DISTASTE FOR WHAT SHE CALLED NUDGE NUDGE WINK WINK XENOPHOBIA HER TARGET A UKIP POSTER UNDER THE HEADLINE BREAKING POINT THE CHAIRS A VAST QUEUE OF HUMANITY WITH THE SLOGAN THE E.U. HAS FAILED US ALL
HERE TO DISCUSS THAT AND OF COURSE THE REST THE ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN NIGEL FARRELL THE LEADER OF THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY MANY WORD SAID ABOUT IT YOU TELL US IN YOUR OWN WORDS THOUGH WHO IS ON THAT POSTER WHO ARE WE SAYING AND WHAT IS AT BREAKING BUT I RELEASED A VERY SIMILAR POSTER IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY EDIBLE ON THE ELECTIONS TO NO COMMENT AT ALL THIS POSTER
WHICH SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WITH THE MICHIGAN ZONE LAST YEAR AFTER MISSUS MERKEL MAY ONE OF THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE POLICY DECISIONS OF MODERN TIMES ONE THAT DIDN'T JUST AFFECT GERMANY BUT EFFECTIVE THE WHOLE OF THE KENYANS OWN WHICH
EFFECTIVELY AS LEADING SHOWING AND BREAKING UP FENCES BEING ERECTED AND PANIC MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW ON THAT POSTER PEOPLE CRUCIAL WHEN YOU'RE SAYING YOUR SHANE WE ARE MULTI WHAT AND HERE'S THE POINT IS WE ARE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION AND DO COME BACK WE'RE NOT IN CHECK CHECKING WE'RE NOT PART OF THE BORDERS AREA NONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE YET TO E.U. CITIZENS NONE OF THEM HAVE A RIGHT
TO THE U.K. SO WHILE ME EVEN FOR VOTE WHICH DOESN'T INVOLVE US JOINING THEM DO YOU HIGHLIGHT ALL THESE PEOPLE THE E.U. IS FAILING AT ALL THAT'S THE SLOGAN AND THE POINT IS THERE'S BEEN TWO LITTLE DEBATE IN THIS REFERENDUM ABOUT THIS UNION THAT WE REMEMBER OF DO YOU MAKE A POSTER SAYING VOTE THIS WAY COS YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT CROATIA SLOVENIA WHY ALL THOSE NICE PEOPLE WE WISH TO BE A MEMBER OF A UNION
WHERE IN THE NORTH MERKEL'S POLICY IS LEADING TO POLITICAL DISLOCATION WHERE FENCES ARE GOING UP EVERYWHERE AND HIM HERSELF WHERE THE EUROZONE CRISIS WILL COME BACK IN JULY WITH GREECE LOOKING FOR THIRD BAYLOR THAT WHY WOULD WE WANT TO BE PART OF THIS FAILING CLUB AND HAVE BEEN TOO LITTLE DEBATE
ACTUALLY ABOUT WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BECOME NOW LOOK WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO PRODUCE A POSTER WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BRITISH POLICY DOES NOT INVOLVE ANYBODY WHO IS IN FACT COMING HERE AND COINCIDENTALLY DOESN'T FEATURE A SINGLE WHITE
FACE LOOK I DIDN'T INVENT THE PICTURE THE PICTURE WAS REAL AND THAT PICTURE WAS ON THE FRONT PAGES OF ALL OUR NATIONAL PRESS LAST YEAR AND THIS PROGRAMME DEBATED THESE BIG MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE TAKING PLACE HE COULD'VE DONE A POSTER OF POLISH IMMIGRANTS WE COULD HAVE SHOWN SOME NURSES WELL HE'S FARMWORKERS THERE'S A RUN OUT THEM COMING TO BRITAIN WE PLAN TO RUN SIX POSTERS IN THE LAST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN AT THIS POSTER WAS DESIGNED FOR THE DAY
IT WAS UNFORTUNATE TIMING THAT WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS ARE RELEASING IT THIS TERRIBLE TRAGIC MURDER TOOK PLACE OF WHAT WE SAW THAT
WE IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW THE POSTER BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A DAY FOR EVERYBODY TO GO QUIET AND BE SILENT LOTS ONE ON THIS COS YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES AND YOU'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT FOR SOME IT'LL BE EFFECTS
WHAT EVEN DISCUSSING IMMIGRATION FOR SOME PEOPLE IS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE GOODNESS ME I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN LAUGHED AT I HAVE BEEN RIDICULED I'VE BEEN CONDEMNED I'VE BEEN DEMONISED BUT THE POINT IS THIS WE'VE MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE UNION THAT IS FAILING AND WE GET THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS OF MUCH OF IT
THE CENTRAL POINT OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS WE WANT TO CONTROL A COUNTRY AND PART OF THAT IS CONTROLLING OUR BORDERS O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS HE'LL HAVE INSTANT ANSWERS I'M SURE BECAUSE IN A LONG TIME TO COME UP WITH THEM IMMIGRATION
IF WE TREATED YOU TO SUSAN'S PRECISELY THE SAME WAY AS WE TREAT PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. ACCORDING TO MIGRATION WATCH YOU'RE VERY KEEN ON THEM THEY HAVE SAID NET MIGRATION WOULD STILL BE MASSIVELY OVER THE GOVERNMENT TARGET TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND WOULD YOU IDENTIFY FOR US ROUGHLY WHO ARE THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO COME HERE NOW WHO ARE NOT IN THE E.U.
NOT ME STUDENTS DO YOU WANNA STOP STUDENTS YOU STOP USING ASCOT WE HAVE NEVER LET HIM OUT I DIDN'T SAY THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CLOSED DOWN SOME OF THE BOGUS COLLARED ISM BOY THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM
AND AT THE MOMENT WHAT IS HAPPENING IS A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AS STUDENTS AND PAINTING TO DO SO WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT AND QUITE GOOD AND SIMPLY WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT A LOT OF THEM EVER GO BUT BUT CAN I JUST SAY THIS NURSES
COME ON WORKERS HAVE BEEN ONE IN ELEVEN CAN I JUST DOCTORS ARE FROM THE Y. CAN I JUST SAY THIS WE'RE QUITE WHY WE'RE NOT TRAINING MORE OF HER OWN DOCTORS OR NURSES IT'S PERHAPS A SEPARATE DEBATE WE'RE GOING TO SAY THIS THIS REFERENDUM IS ALMOST BECOMING AS IF THERE IS A MANIFESTO ON ONE SIDE AND THE MANIFESTO ON THE OTHER SIDE I THINK PERHAPS
WE GET INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS WE LOSE WHAT THIS REFERENDUM IS REALLY ALL ABOUT ALL PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S THE COUNTRY THEY'LL BE LIVING IN AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO YOU IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DRAMATIC CUT IN IMMIGRATION FROM NON E.U. CITIZENS NOT JUST FROM THE E.U. WHICH WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE AND YOU SHOULD GET SOME INDICATION TO PEOPLE I WATCH BUSINESSES WHICH PUBLIC SO WE'LL USE THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE AGAIN YOU CAN USE FLEXIBLE WORK PERMITS ANY TIME YOU HAVE A LABOUR SHORTAGE IN THE MARKET THAT IS WHAT NORMAL COUNTRIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD DO THE KEY POINT IS IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE WE ARE IN CHARGE NOW I THINK I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO GET NET MIGRATION BACK TO POST WAR LEVELS OF THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND LAST ONE ON HIM BUT I'VE GOT BUT ULTIMATELY THIS WILL BE FOR A BRITISH PARLIAMENT TO DECIDE AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE NO CONTROL AND A BRITISH PASSPORT IS AN E.U. PASSPORT OPEN TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE FORGIVE ME I DO WANT TO GET ON TO ANOTHER TOPIC SO ONE LAST ONE YOU'VE BEEN CLEAR CAN YOU BE AS CLEAR AS YOU CAN NOW YOU HAVE IN THERE SIT IN THE PA SAID IF AND I ACCEPT IT IN IF IT MAKES US POORER
TO DO THIS SO BE IT IF WERE A LESS CROWDED HAPPIER NATION PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FOR IT EVEN IF THEY THINK IT'LL MAKE US BORA TODAY'S MIGRATION WHAT REPORT SAYS THAT THAT MIGRATION IS COSTING US MONEY BUT NOBODY COSTS AND NEW SCHOOLS HOSPITALS ALL ROADS I WOULD ACCEPT THAT ECONOMICALLY IT'S ABOUT EVEN STEVEN
BUT I DO THINK THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE CALLED THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND IF YOU CAN'T GET A G.P. APPOINTMENT OR YOUR KIDS CAN'T GET A HOUSE OR YOU CAN'T GET YOUR FIVER UNTO A LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL THESE ARE REAL ISSUES REAL ISSUES INDEED FORGIVE ME FOR RUSHING IT WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO MOVE ON TO THE OTHER BIG ONE WHICH IS THE ECONOMY OF COURSE AGAIN
A LIFETIME YOU'VE EDUCATED TO TRYING TO DO THIS WE ARE THREE DAYS AWAY FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DECISION THIS COUNTRY WILL TAKE PROBABLY IN FIFTY YEARS SO YOU WOULD NOW BE HAPPY TO DESCRIBE FOR US SOME SORT OF NEW TRADING ARRANGEMENT FOR BRITAIN AFTER BREAKS IT YEAH I LIKE MY CAMERAMAN THE OTHER SPENT TWENTY YEARS BUYING AND SELLING GOODS AND TRADING THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD I KNOW HOW TRADE WORKS AND WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN SO WHAT WILL IT LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE A ROTTEN DEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION RIGHT NOW
WE JOIN SOMETHING FOR REDUCED TARIFF COS IN A VERY PROTECTION IS POST WAR WORLD THOSE TARIFFS HAVE NOW COME DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT IS LESS THAN THE ANNUAL CURRENCY MOVEMENT OF STIRLING EURO SIT SHE'LL BE LATE IF YOU LIVE IN OTHER WORDS WITH TARIFF SO JUMBLED UP WITH IF WE DON'T GET OVER ONE WE START TO BRING DOWN TARIFFS FOR AROUND THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT WILL GIVE US CHEAPER CARS CHEAPER CHEAPER SHOES CHEAPER FOOD WON'T END UP WITH TARIFF WITH HER YOU IN CHARGE OF ALL THESE IN THE NEGOTIATION WITH EUROPE AND IT IS VERY VERY SIMPLE
IT IS GUYS WE ARE NOW YOUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER IN THE WORLD YOU NEED US FAR MORE THAN WE NEED YOU WE PROPOSE THAT WE CARRY ON WITH TARIFF FREE ARRANGEMENT AND THEN THEY MADE SAY TODAY HAVE GIVE ME THEY MUST JUST ABOUT TERENCE MY I WERE TAKEN OFF THEIR NOSE TO SPITE THEIR FACES WHICH GIVEN THE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR IN FRANCE AND A GENERAL ELECTION JENNA WILL BE STUPID BUT EVEN IF THEY DID NO DEAL
IS BETTER THAN THE DEAL WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND THAT'S THE NO DEAL LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT THEIR DEAL MILLIONS WHAT NO DEAL MEANS IS IT MEANS TARIFFS THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS AND NO DEAL MEANS TARIFFS ON BRITISH CARS MOVING ON BRITISH OR FRENCH CHEESE MOVIE BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING CRUCIAL AS WELL NOT JUST HERS IF WE'RE NOT IN THE SINGLE MARKET EVERY BRITISH EXPORT TO THE E.U. HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS
MADE IN BRUSSELS MAY BY PEOPLE IN THE OVER WHICH WE WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INFLUENCE AT ALL EVER AS EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL THOSE COS EVERYBODY'S EXPORTS AMERICA HAS TO COMPLY WITH AMERICAN RULES WE HAVE NO SAY IN THE SENATE AND YOU COULD ARGUE
THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR THAT GOES BY THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TRADE WITH THE E.U. DIMINISHES AND I'LL PRESENT WITH THE WORLD DESPITE NOT HAVING THE ADVANTAGE OF MAKING HER OWN DEALS GOES UP AND IF YOU REALLY THINK BRITAIN'S GOT INFLUENCE GIVEN THE LAST SEVENTY TWO OCCASIONS THAT WE HAVE OPPOSED THEIR PIECE OF LAW AT THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND LOST ALL SEVENTY TWO TIMES I THINK FRANKLY WE'RE DELUDING OURSELVES WHAT'S I THINK PEOPLE MAY FIND CURIOUS IS THAT YOU'RE A MAN ON THE EVE IF YOU LIKE OF THIS HUGE DIVORCE YOU'RE RECOMMENDING AN ECONOMIC A POLITICAL
A DIPLOMATIC DIVORCE WITH THE LARGEST FREE TRADE AREA IN THE WORLD IT'S NOT A FREE TRADE WHAT YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY SAYING TO PEOPLE IS
DEBBIE NO COST TO THIS AT ALL I'M SO DON'T WORRY YOUR HEAD I'M SORRY I'LL BE FINE I'M SORRY THIS IS NOT A FREE TRADE AREA IT IS AN OUTDATED CUSTOMS UNION DOMINATED BY BIG BUSINESSES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S VIRTUALLY A CARTEL AND BY BEING PART OF IT WE ARE CUTTING OURSELVES OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD FOR TREASURE AID IN THIS SENSE ISN'T IT MY IF YOU SELL A GOOD TO ONE COUNTRY YOU CAN SELL TO TWENTY SEVEN OTHER WITHOUT SEPARATE WHAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY OTHER AND SEPARATE TARIFFS WE'RE CUTTING OURSELVES OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
WE'RE LIVING IN AN OVER REGULATED REGIME AND THE COSTS OF MEMBERSHIP FAR OUTWEIGH THE REDUCTION OF TARIFFS IN TODAY'S MODERN WORLD WHAT THIS REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION
WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD HE'S COME DOWN TO ONE THING CONFIDENCE DO WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO RUN HER OWN COUNTRY AND MAKE OUR OWN LAWS AND I DO AND THAT'S WHAT WE GOT A VOTE TO LEAVE TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF ALLY AND IF THE BRITISH PEOPLE BRIEFLY DO NOT SHARE YOUR VIEW
THAT'S IT NO MORE FARRAJ IN THERE TODAY OR DO YOU NEVER GIVE UP THIS IS NOT JUST BEFORE WE GO EVERY TIME IT'S AS MANY LIFETIMES AS YOU CAN MANAGE IF THIS PROPOSITION GETS REJECTED
THEN WE WILL NOT BE THE FIRST COUNTRIES LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE DANES OR THE SWEDES OR THE DUTCH WILL BEAT US TO IT BELIEVE ME THIS PROJECT IS DOOMED AS ICE AS WE STARTED OFF THIS INTERVIEW THE MIGRANT CRISIS IS DIVIDED BUT WE'VE NOT SEE YOUR RAISE ROUX IN THE SOUTH AND I HOPE WE WILL MAY DESPAIR AT THE THOUGHT THIS IS THE LAST FARROW'S INTERVIEW THEY'LL HEAR WELL I KNOW YOU'LL BE BACK BUT I STILL THINK I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE I THINK THOSE THAT WANT TO LEAVE HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP AND BELIEVE THAT NIGEL FARAGE AND LEADER OF THE U.K. CAME DEPENDENCE PARTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY PAST EIGHT ARE WE IN THE MIDST OF A NEW LOVE AFFAIR WITH HISTORIC INDOOR AND OUTDOOR PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS LAST MONTH PENZANCE IS JUBILEE POOL REOPENED AFTER A MAJOR REFURBISHMENT MANCHESTER'S VICTORIA BATHS ARE ENTERING THE SECOND STAGE OF THEIR RESTORATION AND THERE ARE CAMPAIGNS CAMPAIGN'S UNDERWAY TO SAVE AND IMPROVE OTHERS' A REPORTER ROSS HAWKINS HAS BEEN TO CHIPPING NORTON I DO IN OXFORDSHIRE TO EXPLORE THEIR FASCINATION
THIS IS THE LATEST LEADER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FANS HAVE ALREADY BEEN THINNED UNFOLD
IF THE PAPER ANY WHY TONY WELCOME TO THE SPECIFIC RIVIERA THE LIGHTER REDOLENT OF THE NERVY OR RAGE RESURGENT IN MALTON
AND LIFT LIKE THAT
YES THEY'VE GOT A BIT SOULLESS AS OPPOSED TO JUST GO INTO A LEISURE CENTRE THERE'S SOME HISTORY BEHIND IT AND IT WAS THERE BEFORE YOUR LEISURE CENTRE AND IT'S NOT JUST A SWIMMING POOL IF YOU DON'T JUST GO SWIMMING HERE YOU COME HERE
THIS ONE OPENED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY HE ALMOST KILLED OFF BY ONE OF THOSE LEISURE CENTRES WITH LUXURIES LIKE A ROOF THIRTY YEARS LATER SAVED BY LOCAL CAMPAIGNING WE LOVE THE PLACE IS QUITE QUAINT AND VERY ENGLISH AND ON DAYS LIKE THIS IT'S NOT MY PEOPLE
IT'S QUITE COLD I GREW UP IN THE STATES AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN PRIVATE PRIVATE CLUBS WHERE THE SAME SORT OF THING IS AVAILABLE WE'VE BEEN TURF YOU LIKE THOSE AROUND THE COUNTRY THERE ARE SOME REALLY REALLY NICE ONES BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE STUNNING LOCATIONS IT'S JUST RUDE
NICE UNDER CLOUDY SKIES TO SUSPEND DISBELIEF AND PRETEND YOU REALLY ARE ON HOLIDAY
WAS THE SWIMMING POOL LIKE ALL GOT GOOK WARMERS A HOT DOG IS IT YEAH I'M NOT SURE HE'S QUITE AS WARM AS A HOT DOG IS IT IT IS
NOT SURE IF ROSS WENT IN HIMSELF WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO MAKE HIS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE TEMPERATURE BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY JENNY LAND WITH A SWIMMING WRITER AND AUTHOR OF SWIMMING LONDON SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO AND FROM SALFORD BY JILL WRIGHT HE'S PROJECT MANAGER OF VICTORIA BATHS TRUST AND FOUNDER OF HISTORIC POOLS OF BRITAIN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING HARRIET AND JENNY WHAT IS THE APPEAL OF SWIMMING IN HER
WELL I THINK IT'S IT'S THREE PRONGED I THINK PROBABLY EVERY SWIMMER WILL WILL WILL TELL YOU A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STORY BUT FOR ME I THINK THERE'S THREE PRONGS OF IT I THINK
FIRSTLY IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITY AND YOU CAN AFFORD YOUR COMMUNITY AROUND AND I DO IN THE WAY THAT YOU CAN'T AS AN INDOOR POOL IN THE SAME WAY
THE SECOND THING I THINK IS THAT IT'S A VERY EGALITARIAN SPACE
THERE'S NO SOCIAL STATUS YOU CAN SWIM REGARDLESS OF AGE SOCIAL STATUS GENDER IT DOESN'T MATTER WE'RE ALL EQUAL IN THIS ONE SPACE
AND THE THIRD AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT PIECE IS THAT I THINK IT'S A COMPLETE ANTIDOTE TO EVERYTHING THAT THE MODERN LIFE THROWS AT US IT'S A VERY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD
BIT OF FUN THAT'S A LOT A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS JUST ABOUT SWIMMING ISN'T IT RATHER THAN NECESSARILY ABOUT THAT IF YOU SAY THAT THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
BRAVE ENOUGH TO SWIM OUTDOORS IN OUR IN OUR WEATHER SMALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING MUCH BIGGER ICE SWIM REGULATE TOOTING LIED IN THE COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY HE'S ACTUALLY VERY BIG UPS FROM THERE FOR YEARS AND I'LL STILL CONTINUE TO MEET PEOPLE I I DON'T KNOW SO IT'S NOT A KIND OF GROUP OF THREE OF US ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER OVER A THERMOS IT'S IT'S IT'S A GATHERING IT'S GATHERING MOMENTUM
HE'LL WRITE A BIT OF YORK OBVIOUSLY HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE VICTORIA BATHS PROGRAMME BUT WHAT IS IT FOR YOU ABOUT IN YOUR CASE CASES ABOUT SOMETHING INDOORS ISN'T IT IN A HISTORIC SETTING OH INDOORS ALL OUTDOOR POOLS HISTORIC POOLS HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER THAN THAN THEIR MODERN SWIMMING POOL THAT THERE'S THAT BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE WE'RE REALLY REALLY PROUD OF MANCHESTER HAVE VICTORIA BATHS WHICH HAS TO BE THE BEST MUNICIPAL POOL IN THE COUNTRY AND ANYONE WALKING THROUGH THE DOORS I DEFY THEM TO DISAGREE WITH ME ON THAT SO THEY CAN BE BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURALLY
SUCH AS VICTORIA BATHS AND EVEN THEM ON MODEST HISTORIC POOLS THEY HAVE LOVELY LITTLE FEATURES BUT THEY ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT AND THEY HOLD OUR SOCIAL HISTORY AND THESE ARE THESE ARE THE POOLS WHERE OUR GRANDPARENTS AND OUR GREAT GRANDPARENTS HAD A BATH
THESE ARE THE POOLS WHERE OUR GRANDPARENTS LEARNT AND PARENTS LEARNT TO SWIM THEY ALSO HAVE THIS GREAT SOCIAL FUNCTION AS JENNY SAID INDOOR POOLS WERE OFTEN FLAWED OVER IN THE WINTER MONTHS FOR DANCES SO PEOPLE MET AND MET THEIR PARTNERS AT VICTORIA BATHS AND WENT ON TO GET MARRIED
SO THEY ARE AMAZING SOCIAL SPACE AS THEY HOLD A HISTORY AND THEY CAN BE RELEVANT AGAIN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BECAUSE LIKE APRIL HAVE BEEN POOLS AGAIN CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT VICTOR OF IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT'S THIS RESTORATION IS COMPLETE WELL VICTORIA BATHS EVEN IN ITS SEPARATE SEMI RESTORED STATE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING AND WE'VE WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO HAVE GOT IT BACK INTO USE AS A HERITAGE ATTRACTION AND IT HAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VISITS A YEAR ALREADY FOR VARIOUS EVENTS WE'VE GOT FOOD EVENT COMING UP IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS SO IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IT'S FULL OF TILES AND STAINED GLASS
BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS GET THE FACILITIES BACK IN YEARS WE GO PULL BACK AND EVENTUALLY THE NEXT PHASE IS TO RESTORE AND REOPEN A TURKISH BATHS WEEK WHICH IS FULL OF TILES AND AGAIN SOME UNIQUE STAIN GLASS JENNY LAND AS FAR AS THESE ARE BOTH TYPES OF POOLS AND
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT A SOCIAL HISTORY'S CONCERNED WE'VE LOST SO MANY OVER THE YEARS IS ONLY ABOUT THIRTY LEFT OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE BUILT I MEAN IN LONDON ALONE THEY USED TO BE NEARLY SIXTY SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WERE I'VE BEEN I FEEL WELL SAY IF I LIVED I LIVED NEAR TO LIE DOES BUT ACTUALLY
TO HAVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN POOLS WHERE THERE USED TO BE NEARLY SIXTY IS HIS SHOCKING CONSIDERING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PROGRESSING FORWARD BUT THERE ARE CAMPAIGNS FOR NEW NEW POOLS AND I'M I THINK WE SHOULD ALL REALLY GET BEHIND THOSE AS A CAMPAIGN TO GET A LIGHT IN THE THAMES AND THERE'S A CAMPAIGN TO BRING PACK OF MAIDA BACK TO LIFE AND
WITH THOUGHT WITH PEOPLE GETTING BEHIND THESE KIND OF THINGS I THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS VERY POSITIVE THAT THE NUMBER WILL CREEP UP WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER USUALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SWIM IT DEPENDS WHAT TIME OF THE YEAR IT IS IN WINTER IN WINTER IT CAN GO BELOW FREEZING BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE CHEMICALS IN THE WATER IT GOES BELOW FREEZING AND THEN YOU BREAK THE ICE AND BUT I MEAN YOU'RE ONLY SWIMMING MAYBE ONE WIDTH AT THAT POINT THIRTY METRES SO BUT YOU BREAK THE ICE AND GET IN WELL THE LIFEGUARDS BREAK THE ICE USUALLY AND THEN YOU JUST GET IN AND SWIM
AND THEN YOU RUN VERY FAST TO THE SAUNA AND SIT IN A SAUNA FEELING LIKE SOME KIND OF GODDESS SO IT'S IT'S WORTH IT IN THE END YOU'RE RIGHT YOU DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS OF COURSE IN IN SOMEWHERE LIKE VICTORIA BATHS WELL WE'RE NOT A PULL YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU GO TO A HISTORIC POOL AND END UP THERE HE'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE BREAK IN THE ISO VISIT BIT VISIT YOUR LOCAL HISTORIC POOR IVY AND GET A SWIMMING BATHS AND NORTHAMPTON IS A BEAUTIFUL ART DECO POOL GO TO YOUR LOCAL LIDO DRUG DROITWICH SPA LEADER WANT JUBILEE PARK IN LINCOLNSHIRE
THESE POOLS GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AND GOING SWIMMING AND ALSO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL HISTORIC POOL BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH TO OFFER WE WERE LIVING IN HARD TIMES BUT I WOULD SAY HISTORIC POOLS WE'RE BUCKING THE TREND YOU KNOW THESE POOLS IF THEY'RE INVESTED AND THEY'RE WELL MANAGED
AND WE'VE GOT LEISURE TRUST AND COMMUNITY GROUPS AROUND THE COUNTRY MANAGING THE THESE POOLS NOW REALLY SUCCESSFULLY WE'RE BUCKING THE TREND YOU KNOW WE'RE INCREASING PUBLIC PROVISION AS WELL AS CELEBRATING OUR HISTORY CHILL RIGHT AND JENNY LANDER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH NOW YOU SAY THAT I DO I SAY LEAVE
LET'S CALL THE WHOLE LET'S JUST CALL IT A POOL IT'S MUCH SAFER I'M NOT SURE HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THIS AND YOU'RE TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT ROB WILL KNOW HE'S HERE WITH THE SPORTS LET'S CALL IT AN OPEN AIR POOL GOOD MORNING TO YOU A DAY OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENT TODAY FOR THE FOOTBALLERS OF ENGLAND AND WALES A WIN FOR BOTH WILL TAKE THEM THROUGH TO THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN KNOCKOUT PHASES FIRST AND SECOND IN GROUP B. THE DRAWER WOULD ALSO DO
FOR ENGLAND BEYOND THAT IT STARTS TO GET A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT MAYBE JUST AS COMPLEX THE PERMUTATIONS GOING THROUGH THE MIND OF ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HODGSON AS HE CONSIDERS HIS STARTING LINE UP FOR THIS EVENING'S MATCH AGAINST SLOVAKIA THE TIMES CHIEF FOOTBALL WRITER HENRY WINTER IS ON THE LINE FROM THE CENTRE MORNING HENRY MORNING ALL THE PAPERS THIS MORNING SEEM TO AGREE RUDI RESTED AND MAYBE AS MANY AS SIX CHANGES TO THE STARTING LINE UP THAT HOW YOU SEE IT
DEFINITELY STORAGE WILSHIRE HENDERSON KLEIN BIRCH AND IN STIRLING KANE WALKER I MEAN IT IS IT IS A GAMBLE BUT WE SO OFTEN ACCUSED ENGLAND PARTICULARLY TOURNAMENTS ARE BEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY WEAKENED THE MANAGER OF THE LACKING A VENTURE AND HODGSON HAS BEEN BOLTED BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES A SLOVAKIAN TEAM TALK WITH HIM RESTING ROONEY IN PARTICULAR THERE'S BOULDER THERE'S RECKLESS
HE'S DROPPED AS YOU SAY HE WILL BE IT WILL IT WILL LOOK RATHER FOOLISH TWENTY ROY HODGSON IF THEY ACTUALLY
WELL I THINK THAT THE SITUATION OF THE GROUP PARTICULARLY IF THEY WIN I'LL PROBABLY GET A DRAW WILL MEAN THEY GET THEIR PREFERRED CHOICE WINCHES PARIS ON SATURDAY AGAINST A THIRD PLACE TEAM OBVIOUSLY PARIS CLOSER CHANTIX MINIMUM TRAVELLED MINIMAL TRAVEL SO THEY'D LIKE THAT YES IT WAS A GAMBLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FULL BACK SOME THE SPURS FULL WALK AND ROSIE USED TO BEING ROTATED THIS SEASON AND KLINE AND BERTRAND
COME IN YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOOD FOR IS NOT TOO MUCH TO IT BUT BETWEEN THEM BUT THE CONCERN IS WHEN A PLAYER LIKE HER MUSIC THROUGH SLOVAKIA HAS I MEAN HE'S A REAL DANGER IF HE GETS ANY ROOM THEN THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM SO BIG GAME FOR WILL SHOULD BE GAME FOR HENDERSON
MEANWHILE HENRY THERE'S THE ISSUE OF HODGSON'S CONTRACT WHICH OUTGOING IF H. EMIGRATE DYKES WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE RENEWED EVEN IF ENGLAND AND GET TO THE SEMIS WATSON DIDN'T LIKE THE TIMING OF THAT REMARK
HE DIDN'T IT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE F.A. HAVE BEEN SORT OF BRIEFING AND SAYING PUBLICLY SINCE DECEMBER WHEN MARTIN GLYNN MATEYS COMETS I THINK IT MADE SENSE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE PERFORMANCE RELATED ELEMENT TO ANY CONTRACT DECISION I DON'T QUITE LIKE THE IDEA OF ENGLAND IF ENGLAND HAVE ANOTHER BRAVE FAILURE SENDING OFF WHICH WE KNOW ABOUT INSANITY OR PENALTIES WHICH AGAIN WE KNOW ABOUT INSANITY AND AN ENGLAND BARROW OUT OF A TOURNAMENT THAT WAY THEN MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE HIM A CONTRACT I THINK IT'S SEMI FINALS OR BUST
WHAT WAS INCHING YESTERDAY'S REALLY CAME OUT AND WAS VERY FULSOME IN ANY SUPPORT THERE'S A BIT MANDY RICE DAVIES HE WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T HE BECAUSE HE'S CAPTAIN AND HE'S DOING WELL UNDER HODGSON AND HE'S NOT DROP TODAY I MEAN HE IS JUST REST BECAUSE HODGSON NEEDS HIM FOR THE NEXT STAGE WILL'S MEANWHILE FACE RUSSIA WIN BUT ALSO GUARANTEE THEM A PLACE IN THE LAST SIXTEEN RUSSIA HAVE BEEN UNDERWHELMING OF COURSE IN THIS TOURNAMENT FOR THE WINNABLE MATCH FOR WALES TODAY SURELY
RUSSIA HAD BEEN UNDERWHELMING OFF THE PITCH AND FAIRLY OFFENSIVE OFF THE PITCH SO I DON'T THINK THERE'LL BE TOO MUCH MORNING AMONGST ORGANISERS OR POLICE OR MORE SUPPORTERS OUT HERE OF RUSSIA WENT OUT SO I THINK WALES CAN DO THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT A FAVOUR TODAY O.K.

BUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING WE WE AGREE TOP WE AGREE LOOK AT THE WEATHER NOW RAIN AND CLOUD SLOWLY CLEARING THE SOUTH ARE BRIGHTER AND IT'S
LET'S SAY THAT TO GET READING CLOUD SLOWLY CLEARING THE SOUTH BRIGHTER FURTHER NORTH BUT LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE WHO'S SAYING TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE KATHY CLARKSTON HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN LADY VICE SAYS SHE NICE SUPPORTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE CALLED THE HIT AND XENOPHOBIA OF THE LEAF SIDE SHE SET HER MIND WAS MADE UP BY A UKIP POSTER SHOWING REFUGEES ON THE BORDER BETWEEN SLOVENIA AND CROATIA
THE UKIP LEADER OR NIGEL THOROUGH TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THE UNION WAS FEELING WITH COUNTRIES REINSTATING BORDER FENCES TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT HE SAID HE WANTED BRITAIN TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS
PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN RECALLED THIS AFTERNOON TO THAT POLITICIANS CAN PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO THE LABOUR M.P. JOE COX SHE WAS KILLED IN HER WEST YORKSHIRE CONSTITUENCY LAST THURSDAY AND YOU REPORT SUGGESTS CHILDREN HELD IN CUSTODY AND ENGLAND AND WALES ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE FORCE USED AGAINST THEM BY STAFF THAN THEY WERE FIVE YEARS AGO THE FINDINGS HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM
UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY SAYS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DISPLACED BY CONFLICT HAS REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED IN A NEW REPORT PUBLISHED ON WORLD REFUGEE DAY THE U.N. SAYS MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE EITHER REFUGEES ASYLUM SEEKERS OR INTERNALLY DISPLACED BY THE END OF LAST YEAR
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE SOUTHERN RAIL SERVICES ALREADY FAR FROM IDEAL ON A NORMAL DAY WILL BE AT A STANDSTILL TOMORROW BECAUSE OF A STRIKE CALLED BY THE R. AND T. UNION SOME M.P.S HAVE CALLED FOR THE COMPANY THAT RUNS THE SERVICE GO VIA THAMES LINK TO BE STRIPPED OF ITS FRANCHISE FOR LABOUR'S POSITION WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM NOTTINGHAM BY THE SHADOW TRANSPORT SECRETARY LILLIAN GREENWOOD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN
IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE FRANCHISE IS FAILING PASSENGERS WHEN ENDURING THE WORST DELAYS IN THE COUNTRY FURS UP TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND THE PROMISED INVESTMENT LOOKS FURTHER AWAY THAN EVER I THINK BY RULING OUT CANCELLING THE FRANCHISE MINISTERS A FORFEIT IN THE CHANCE TO WORK PLACE ANY MEANINGFUL PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY GO VIA ATTEMPT LINK RAILWAY TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE WHAT THE REAL MINISTER CLAIRE PERRY HAS SAID
IS THAT THE OPERATOR'S NOT BEING LET OFF THE HOOK AT THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT DOES CONTAIN CLEAR PENALTIES FOR REPEATED POOR PERFORMANCE
WE'LL LET THE DAY THEY'VE PAID SOME PENALTIES BUT BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT THAT THEY PAID OUT LAST YEAR TO THE SHAREHOLDERS I THINK SHE'S RUNNING AWAY FROM HER OWN RESPONSIBILITIES THIS IS AN UNUSUAL FRANCHISE IN THE OLD BUT THE REVENUE RISK FALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT AND I THINK BY RULING OUT CANCELLING THAT FRANCHISE THE MINISTER IS LETTING GO FOR YOUR THAMES LINK OFF THE HOOK
BUT I MEAN ENDING ENDING THE FRANCHISE EARLY IF THAT'S WHAT IT CAME TO WOULD COME AT A COST WOULDN'T IT TO THE TAXPAYER WELL IF I WAS THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY I'D BE COMMISSIONING URGENT LEGAL ADVICE ON WHETHER THE FRANCHISE COULD BE ENDED WITHOUT INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE TAXPAYER RIGHT C. C. EXCEPT THAT IF THE COSTS WERE SIGNIFICANT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO IF YOU WEIGH UP
WEIGH UP THE COST TO THE TAXPAYER LIVING DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT ABOUT WHEN THE FRANCHISE KIT CAN BE ENDED WHEN THE COMPANY ARE IN D. FAULT THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT TO TAKE PLACE IT'S BUT IT'S ITS MINISTERS WHO ARE REFUSING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN WHILE PASSENGERS ARE SUFFERING JUST COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS LEVELS OF POOR SERVICE IS THERE A CASE FOR THE UNION TO ANSWER THEY'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF OF ORGANISING ON OFFICIAL
ACTION THE FACT THAT SO MANY TRAIN CONDUCTORS HAVE CALLED IN IN SICK MORE THAN A THOUSAND TIMES IN A MONTH
WELL I MEAN I THINK IT'S REALLY REGRETTABLE THAT THE THAT THE DEBATE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THAT LEVEL YOU HEARD THE OTHER DAY ON THE PROGRAMME BUT THOSE ALLEGATIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN DISPUTED IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BUT THERE IS A GENUINE DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE A SAFE SERVICE IT'S AND IT'S APPALLING THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL ASIAN WASN'T FIXED SET HAVE TAKEN A SICK DAY IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS
IT'S CLEAR THAT INDUSTRIAL ASIANS BETWEEN G.T. R. AND THE UNIONS HAVE GOT INTO AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE PLACE BUT OF COURSE THAT ISN'T HELPED BY THE COMMENTS OF ONE OF THE THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS WHO WAS ON RECORD AS SAYING THAT DEPARTMENT WANTS TO BREAK RAIL EMPLOYEES AND YOU HEARD FROM TONY MILES LAST WEEK THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY WERE SHOCKED AT THE SORT OF RHETORIC THAT THEY BUT THEY'VE HEARD MY BUT IT BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER YOU THINK THERE IS BUT THERE IS A DISTANCE THAT BOTH SIDES NEED TO GO ON THIS THE UNION AS AS WELL AS THE AS THE OWNERS OF THE FRANCHISE
THE LOOK THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT THAT THIS DISPUTE IS GOING TO BE ENDED IF PEOPLE GET BACK ROUND THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT OVER AT THE HEART OF THIS THERE ARE CLEARLY GENUINE CONCERNS ABOUT SAFE SURFACE AND THOSE NEED TO BE PROPERLY DISCUSSED AT THE MOMENT THAT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENT ON ROLLING OUT CHANGES TO TO THE ROLES OF RAIL EMPLOYEES WITH MINIMAL CONSULTATION AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE
LILLIAN GREENWOOD A THANK YOU WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE REAL MINISTER CLAIRE PERRY TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME TO TALK ABOUT SOUTHERN RAIL BUT SO FAR SHE HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TWENTY TWO MINUTES TONIGHT I KNOW WE'VE ALL HEARD OF BLETCHLEY ARE PLACED THE NAZI CODE WAS BROKEN OF COURSE FEW OF US THOUGH MAY HAVE HEARD OF M. D. ONE CHURCHILL'S PRIVATE SABOTAGE AND DESTRUCTION UNIT KNOWN AS CHURCHILL'S TOYSHOP NICK ENDED UP IN A HOUSE IN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE CALLED THE FUR'S NOW MORE OF US WILL HEAR OF IT BECAUSE A GILES MILK NOSEY STORING AND AUTHOR OF THE SPLENDIDLY TITLED
THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE MORNING TO JUDGE JUST HOW UNGENTLEMANLY WORTH VERY VERY UNGENTLEMANLY INDEED ONE OF THEIR LEADERS SAID THAT THIS WAS TOTAL WAR AND TOTAL WAR IS A VERY DIRTY GAME AND THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF DESIGNING BESPOKE SABOTAGE WEAPONS FOR UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS IN NAZI OCCUPIED EUROPE WHICH MATTERED IN TERMS THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR IT MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE THEY WERE DESTROYING KEY INFRASTRUCTURE BRIDGES VIADUCTS
POWER STATIONS WHICH WERE USED TO POWER TO SUPPORT THE NAZI WAR MACHINE SO INSTEAD OF ATTACKING DIRECTLY HITLER'S ARMY THEY WERE TAKING OUT KEY PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE WAS READING ABOUT ONE FASCINATING WHERE POWERED BY THE ANISEED BALLS TAKEN FROM THE LOCAL SWEET SHOP THERE WERE NO ANISEED BALLS EATEN BY CHILDREN FOR A WHILE NO THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST INVENTIONS OF M. D. ONE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE ONE THIS WAS THE LIMPETS MINE WHICH WAS A FANTASTIC WEAPON OF SABOTAGE IT WAS SIMPLY A MAGNETIC MINE
STUCK ON TO ANYTHING THAT WAS MADE OF METAL METAL SEND A DIVER DOWN AND HE COULD PLANT ONE UNDER THE WATERLINE OF A SHIP THEY COULD BE USED TO BLOW UP TURBINES POWER STATIONS ANYTHING AND IT RELIED ON THE THE DETONATING MECHANISM INDEED RELIED ON ANISEED BALLS AND TO KEEP IT DRY SO IMPORTANT THEY WOULDN'T SET OFF IN THE WAREHOUSE THEY USED CONDOMS OVER THOSE ANISEED BALLS TO MAKE THEM DRY WHY DIANA SEPALS BECAUSE HANSIE BALLS IT WAS DISCOVERED THEY DISSOLVED WITH ABSOLUTE REGULARITY
SO IT WAS IN FACT A HIGHLY ACCURATE WAY OF JUDGING WHEN THE LIMPET MINE IS GOING TO DETONATE AND THEY ALSO DESIGNED SOMETHING WE NOW CALL A DIRTY BOMB WOULDN'T WE IN TERMS OF ATTACKING RYAN HARD HYBRID WITH THIS IS VERY INTERESTING ONE OF THE KEY MEN IN EMPTY ONE WAS THIS A VERY ECCENTRIC MAVERICK INVENTOR CALLED CECIL CLARKE AND HIM HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO KILL ASSASSINATE HYDRATE
NOW HIDE RICK ALWAYS DROVE ROUND PRAGUE IN AN ARMOUR PLATED MERCEDES NOT AN EASY VEHICLE TO BLOW UP YOU CAN DO WITH A GRENADE IT WASN'T POWERFUL ENOUGH SUIT CECIL CLARKE TOOK AN ANTI TANK MINE AND COMPRESSED IT AND TURNED IT INTO AN ABSOLUTELY LETHAL DIRTY WEAPON THAT COULD BE THROWN AT THE MERCEDES BLOW UP SHRED THE ARMOUR PLATING AND STRIVE SHRAPNEL INTO HIJINKS BODY A VERY NASTY INDEED
AND BUT VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF COURSE HIDE RIC DID DIE I SHOULD JUST SAY THIS WAS VERY VERY CONTROVERSIAL ANTHONY EDEN WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THIS HE SAID THIS IS WAR CRIMES BUSINESS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ALL THE MORE FASCINATING THAT THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO CECIL PART THE ENGINEER WHO DESIGNED THAT AFTERWARDS HE WENT ON TO DO WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARILY AFTER THE WAR HE WENT ON TO BECOME A KEY MEMBER OF C. N. D. THE CAMPAIGN FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AS DID SEVERAL OTHERS SOME OF THEM WERE PACIFISTS AND BUT THEY JUST FELT THAT IN THE WAR AGAINST THE NAZIS
ANYTHING THE RULE BOOK WAS TORN UP WHY WAS IT SO SECRETIVE WE KNOW WAS SET UP OUTSIDE AS IT WERE AT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE DISTANT FROM THEM WHY SIR BECAUSE THE ARMY BELIEVED AMAZINGLY STILL THROUGHOUT THE WAR BELIEVED IN FIGHTING A GENTLEMAN'S WAR THERE WERE CERTAIN LINES YOU SHOULDN'T CROSS AND MY MY MEN I WRITE ABOUT THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING THEY SAID ANYTHING ASSASSINATION MURDER BLOWING UP ANYTHING CIVILIANS EVEN IF IT GOT TO YOUR GOAL
THIS OF COURSE WAS THAT THEY COULDN'T BE RELEASED INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AS IT WHERE PEOPLE COULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT SO CHURCHILL INSTRUCTED THIS THIS ORGANISATION TO REMAIN COMPLETELY SECRET IN ITS LITTLE COUNTRY HOUSE IN AYLESBURY AND
EVERYTHING WAS KEPT UNDER WRAPS AND THEN SHE'S FUNNY IT DISSOLVED THOUGH AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO KEEP IT GOING AFTER THE WAR THERE WAS TALK OF KEEPING IT GOING THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WANTS TO KEEP IT GOING BUT NO IT WAS COMPLETELY WOUND UP AND NOTHING WAS EVER WRITTEN ABOUT IT UNTIL UNTIL NOW HAVING SAID THAT THE AMERICANS HAD THEIR OWN EQUIVALENT ORGANISATION THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES THAT WAS NOT WOUND UP AFTER THE WAR HE WAS EXPANDED AND BECAME THE C.I.A. WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO THAT WHEN CHARLES MILTON AUTHOR OF THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE LAST NIGHT ALBANIA SECURED THEIR FIRST EVER WIN IN A MAJOR FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT AGAINST ROMANIA THE SCORE WAS ONE NIL ALBANIA WON'T KNOW UNTIL NEXT WEEK WHEN THE GROUP FACES OVER WHETHER THEY'RE THROUGH TO THE NEXT STAGE BUT IF THEY DO GO THROUGH THEY'LL PLAY EITHER ENGLAND OR GERMANY IN THE NEXT ROUND WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM TIRANA THE ALBANIAN CAPITAL BY ERY EN VILLE I WHO'S THE MAYOR OF TIRANA GOOD MORNING
YOU MUST BE DELIGHTED OH REAL EVERYBODY LIGHTED PEOPLE BEEN DANCING IF YOU'RE UP ONLY I WOULDN'T WANT YOU PEOPLE YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WOULD BE IT'S NOT THAT IT'S IN THE BUNK UP WITH MUM MUMMY DE POSSIBLE DO YOU THINK I THINK BLUBBING ICKLE TOO LONG COULD BE UNDER CLOCK YOU LOOK AS IF YOU'VE GOT A BLOODY SPORTS IN POLITICS I WANT COME ALONG ONE LEAK WE'VE GOT A DOUBLE GREAT
ROMANIA MANAGER HAS SAID THAT IT WAS THE SUPPORTERS OF THE T.B. ALBANIAN SUPPORTERS WHO GAVE ENERGY TO THE FOOTBALLERS OF THAT HELP THEM SCORE
CARRY ON MAYOR OF TIRANA THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS A QUARTER TO NINE NOW IF YOU REALLY EAT OR THINK YOU READ THE SAME PAPER SEVEN DAYS A WEEK YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE PUZZLED IF YOU THINK THE OWNERS HAVE NEWSPAPER SIMPLY TELL THEIR EDITORS WHO HOOTER BACK IN SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS THIS REFERENDUM HE MIGHT BE A BIT SURPRISED BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE SUNDAY TIMES CAME OUT FOR LEAVE THE TIMES THE DAY BEFORE HAD BACK REMAIN THE MAIL ON SUNDAY HAS JUST BACKED REMAIN AND WE DON'T LET'S BE HONEST BE A LITTLE SHOCKED IF THE DAILY MAIL
WAS TO DO THE SAME TO JUST TO DISCUSS HOW NEWSPAPERS MAKE THESE SORTS OF DECISIONS AND WITH A FRANKLY THEY MATTER A DAMN TO THE OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS OR REFERENDUM A DOMINIC LAWSON THE COLUMNIST FOR THE MALE AND THE SUNDAY TIMES JUST TO CONFUSE THINGS AND A FORMER EDITOR OF THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH AND THE SPECTATOR AND LISA MARKLE IS HERE SHE WAS THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY UNTIL IT CLOSED RECENTLY JUST BACK IN MARGE LISA
YOU DID EDITOR A FINE SUNDAY PAPER WHEN IT CAME TO BACKING HER PARTY IN THE GENERAL ELECTION
YOU CLEARLY WEREN'T TOLD YOU DON'T HAVE A PROPRIETOR BUT AT THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY DID YOU HAGGLE WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OR YOU COULD DO THIS AND I'LL DO THAT WAS ENTIRELY YOUR JUDGEMENT GOOD MORNING WHEN I WAS THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY WE OPERATED AS SEPARATE NEWSPAPERS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE POOLED MANY OF OUR RESOURCES SO BEFORE THE ELECTION WE GOT TOGETHER WITH THE POLITICAL TEAMS HAVE BOTH PAPERS AND TALKED IT THROUGH THERE WAS NO PROPRIETORIAL
INFLUENCE ON THAT DISCUSSION AND IN FACT WHAT HAPPENED JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION WAS ON MY SUNDAY I FELT VERY VERY STRONGLY NOT
TO ENDORSE A POLITICAL PARTY WE CALLED FOR RICH READERS TO ENGAGE IN THEIR POLITICAL
YOU NOTED TO VOTE BASICALLY PLEASE VOTE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO USE YOUR VOTE AND I WOULD SAY EXACTLY THE SAME TODAY I WAS FASCINATED THAT DAILY INDEPENDENT CAME UP FOR THE COALITION UNFORTUNATELY EVER SINCE THEN MANY HAVE MADE HAY WITH THE FACT THAT THAT WAS A CALL FOR TO VOTE TORY WHICH IT WASN'T BUT THE NUANCE GETS LOST OF COURSE AT THIS AT THESE TIMES WHATEVER I MEAN THESE VERY LONG CHEERY LEADING ARTICLES THAT YOU SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS
THERE'S ALWAYS JUST ONE WORD AT THE END REMAIN OR LEAVE DOMINIC LAWSON AS YOU READ THE MAIL ON SUNDAY IS A COLUMNIST IN THE MALE WE REMOTELY SURPRISED THAT THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING WHICH I THINK MANY NON READERS OF THE MAIL ON SUNDAY WOULD FIND SURPRISING BACKING THE PRIME MINISTER AND BACKING REMAIN
I WASN'T SURPRISED NICK BECAUSE THEIR COVERAGE FOR SOME WEEKS HAD BEEN VERY MUCH TILTED TOWARDS REMAIN AND GENERALLY SPEAKING AND PARTICULAR TABLOID PAPERS THE THE NEWS AND THE OPINION OF A KIND OF CONTINUUM
THERE ISN'T REALLY MUCH OF A DISTINCTION AND SO YOU CAN PRETTY WELL PREDICT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT THE MAID OF SUNDAY MAIL ON SUNDAY WENT THE WAY HE DID IT HOW THEY MAKING THEIR JUDGEMENTS DOMINIC COME IN ARE THEY WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE PROPRIETY SAYS ARE THEY THINK HOLD ON THIS IS MY BIG MOMENT I CAN SAY WHATEVER I LIKE I CAN USE THIS AS A PLATFORM OR ARE THEY TRYING TO GUESS WHAT THEY THINK THEIR READERS THINK
WELL I THINK THE THIRD IS ACTUALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE I THINK THAT NEWSPAPER EDITORS ARE A LITTLE BIT LIKE POLITICIANS THEY HAVE A CONSTITUENCY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE COMPLETELY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND INDEED I THINK MOST OF THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE BEEN POLLING THEIR READERS EITHER PUBLICLY IN THE CASE THE TELEGRAPH OR PRIVATELY AND IF THEY SEE THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEIR READERS IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THEY WILL IF YOU LIKE FOLLOW
FOLLOW THE READERS ALTHOUGH THE READERS OF COURSE YOU COULD SAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE PAPERS LINE PREVIOUSLY BUT IS THERE A DRAMATIC CHANGE A DIFFERENCE LISA BETWEEN AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE READERS OF THE MALE AND THE RIDGES THE MAIL ON SUNDAY I WOULD BE ASTONISHED IF THERE WAS A BIG DIFFERENCE I MEAN I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE CLEAR WATER BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM IS IS GETTING WIDER AND WIDER BUT I THINK ONE OF THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS REFERENDUM IS THAT THE
THE DON'T KNOWS AND THE UNDERSIDE IT'S A HUGE AND ANY NEWSPAPER EDITOR AT AS DOMINIC DOESN'T WANT TO CUT OFF WHAT COULD BE A LARGE PART OF THE AUDIENCE BY SAYING YOU ARE TOTALLY WRONG HE MUST DO THIS OR DO YOU NOTHING AT ALL AND SO
THERE IS I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S A BIT OF HEDGE BETTING GOING ON OF COURSE FOR PROPRIETORS WON A FUME HASN'T ALLEGEDLY HE CALLED IT WRONG FOR
MANY MANY MANY YEARS OR NOT ALLEGEDLY DEFINITELY YOU WONKY ALL I'M THINKING OF RUPERT MURDOCH IF ONE OF HIS PAPER SAYS REMAIN AND ONE SAYS LEAVE OF COURSE HE CAN CALL VICTORY EITHER WAY YES AND HE'S GOT THE SUN OF COURSE DOMINIC LAWSON IN THE CASE OF RUPERT MURDOCH HASN'T IT THE TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES SPLIT BUT THE SUN BACK TO WHAT THEY KNOW THEIR MASTER WHO WANT THEM TO SAY
BUT ALSO WHAT THEIR READERS WANT THEM TO SAY AND I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THIS TIME IS THAT THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY IS BETTER SAY COMPLETELY SPLIT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REFERENDUM THE MAIL AND THE EXPRESS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH ARE NOW SEEN AS VERY EUROSCEPTIC WERE
FANTASTICALLY PRO E.U. AND THE ONLY PAPER WHICH BACKED LEAVE WAS THE COMMUNIST MORNING STAR AND I THINK THAT NEWSPAPERS ARE NOW LESS CONNECTED TO WHAT WE USE CALLED THE ESTABLISHMENT THAN THERE USED TO BE YOU HAVE ALL THEM THERE THE OFFICIAL LINE OF ALL THE MAIN PARTIES IS TO REMAIN THAT WAS ALSO TRAIN SEVENTY FIVE BUT I THINK NEWSPAPERS TODAY I'M MUCH MORE INDEPENDENT THAN THEY WERE
MORE INDEPENDENT LISA AND CRITICALLY IT'S ABOUT THE NEWS COVERAGE THAT INFLUENCE PEOPLE IT ISN'T IT RATHER THAN THE EDITORIAL LINE IN OTHER WORDS I DO THE PAPER HAVE YOU EVERY MORNING I'M IN HERE THE MALE THE TELEGRAPH PUT IMMIGRATION ON THE FRONT PAGE ALMOST EVERY DAY THEY CAN THAT'S HOW THEY'RE SHAPING OPINION NOT BY WHAT'S UP LEADER COLUMNS AS A DAY OR TWO BEFORE
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET PAST THE VERY SHOUTY FRONT PAGES THAT WAS IN FACT THE EXPRESS I BELIEVE HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE PRESS REGULATOR FOR A THIRTY TWO FRONT PAGES MORE LET IN A ROW ATTACKING MIGRANTS WHICH IS A VERY DAMAGING METHOD OF BEATING PEOPLE OVER THE HEAD AND I WOULD PERSONALLY HOPE THAT READERS
ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM CAN SEE PAST THEY SHOUTING FRONT PAGES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY GET THEIR LEADER COLUMN INSIDE THERE ARE SOME VERY WISE VOICES DOMINIC LAWSON YOU DO WRITE COLUMNS FOR THE MAIL I KNOW YOU'RE NOT AS IT WERE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT COULD YOU BELIEVE THAT THE MALE MIGHT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN TELL US TO QUIT
NO NO I COULDN'T AND IT'S BEEN IMMENSELY CONSISTENT AND AS I SAY TABLOID PAPERS TEND TO HAVE A KIND OF THREAD RIGHT FROM THE FRONT TO THE BACK WHAT GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO TODGER DROPPER GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO ONE OF THE DELICATE MATTER IN TIMES INSIDE A NEWSPAPER SOME ALLEGE THAT THERE'S A KIND OF WAR GOING ON BETWEEN THE
SENIOR EDITOR AT THE MAIL PULLED BAKER THE MAN WHO RUNS THIS SUNDAY PAPER THE MAIL ON SUNDAY GEORDIE GREG A A BATTLE GOING ON FOR WHO RUNS A BETTER PAPER AND WHO IS THE FUTURE OF WHAT IS AFTER ALL ARE ONE OF OUR MOST INFLUENTIAL ONE OF OUR MOST POWERFUL NEWSPAPER BRANDS WHAT ACTUALLY HAD ENOUGH IN A FUNNY WHERE DID YOU GET SO WHEN I DID THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH THE PAPERS I ALWAYS FELT THE GREATEST RIVALRY WAS A DAILY TELEGRAPH
AND I THINK ACTUALLY SUNDAY PAPERS BECAUSE THEN WEIGHT DWARFED BY THE DAILY PAPERS EDITORS A SUNDAY PAPERS ARE VERY VERY KEEN TO ESTABLISH THEIR INDEPENDENCE TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT AND MAYBE A BIT MAVERICK SO IT'S NOT SO SURPRISING ACTUALLY AND LAST WHAT DO YOU DO DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS IN OTHER WORDS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR SOME READERS TO HEAR BACK MAYBE THEIR OWN OPINIONS REFLECTED TO THEM BUT IS ANYBODY GOING TO BE MUCH AFFECTED PURELY BY THE EDITORIAL COLUMN NOT NOT BY THE NEWS COVERAGE
NOT PURELY BY THE TOUR BUT REMEMBER THIS COULD BE INCREDIBLY CLOSE AND THEREFORE IF IT WAS VERY ONE SIDED IT REALLY WOULDN'T MATTER BUT IN A REALLY REALLY CLOSE BATTLE I KNOW THE POLITICIANS NINE OATH VERY SENIOR POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN RINGING UP EDITORS AND TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM TO BACK THERE SO I DON'T THE POLITICIANS WOULD DO THAT IF IT WAS COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT DOMINIC LAWSON LISA MARCO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE HAVE THE LEAVES ARE SHOCKED BY THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE SAME ORGANISATION MAY EVER BE IN ANY SENSE RIVALS
OUTRAGEOUS OF COURSE THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DISPLACED BY CONFLICT AROUND THE WORLD IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL EVER RECORDED THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY SAYS MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ARE EITHER REFUGEES ASYLUM SEEKERS OR INTERNALLY DISPLACED THAT WAS AT THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AN INCREASE OF FIVE MILLION IN A YEAR THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL HAS JUST BEEN VISITING CAMPS ON THE GREEK ISLANDS THAT LAST YEAR BECAME THE FRONT LINE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND A REPORT AMANDINE RHANA WHO SAW IT ALL FIRST HAND REPORTS FROM GREECE
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO GERMANY
SIX YEAR OLD BOOTY ISN'T ALONE EVERYONE HERE WANTS TO MOVE ON
MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND MIGRANTS HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES TRAPPED IN GREECE AS THE BORDERS HAVE BOLTED SHUT AROUND THEM DO FAMILIES THREE FAMILIES IN ONE CONTAINER SLEEPING YONDER
MORE VISITORS AREN'T USUALLY ALLOWED INTO THIS GOVERNMENT RUN REFUGEE CAMP ON THE ISLAND OF CHAOS AND ARE SOME OF THE RESIDENTS SHOW ME AROUND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY
CONDITIONS ARE CRAMPED AND BASIC ER THERE ARE CROWDED AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY FEEL AS IF THEY ARE IN PRISON
KIPPED HERE IN THIS ISLAND WAITING FOR FOR WHAT THEY JUST ASKING WHAT IS A REFORMED WHAT IS A WAS
WHY YOU DON'T LET US GUILT WE ARE VICTIMS WHO ARE NOT MURDERERS WHERE INNOCENT PEOPLE SO WHERE YOU ARE JUST KEEPING US HERE IN THIS DANGEROUS PLACE
THEY ARE VERY NERVOUS THEY ARE VERY DEPRESSED IT'S NOT SUITABLE LIFE FOR A HUMAN BEING
GREECE WITH ITS FAILING ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING TO COPE
THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED FUTURE CRAMMED INTO THIS CAMP WHICH STILL NEEDS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND MORE ON THE ISLAND SURVIVING ENTIRELY ON CHARITY
AND THE FEW DONATIONS ARE JUST DAYS
THE PEOPLE THAN I AM RIGHT THING IN MONTH FULL O.K. I LIKE IT
I CAN STAY FOR
ONE MONTH ANOTHER MONTH OF FILMS ARE WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT WASN'T IT
WERE THEY FRIENDLY I DON'T HAVE A MONEY AND LOOK HER IN THE HEAD OF THE U.N. BAN KI MOON HAS COME TO A CAMP ON LES BOSS TO SEE THE PROBLEMS FOR HIMSELF
HAVING SPENT PART OF HIS CHILDHOOD AS A REFUGEE WHEN THE KOREAN WAR BROKE OUT HE SAYS HE'S HERE TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH HOPE
WHAT HE DOESN'T HAVE A SOLUTIONS THIS IS A HEARTBREAKING TO SEE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG BOYS
CRYING ON THE APPEALING TO ME THESE ARE THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE HAVE TO WORK THEY NEED TO HEAD DO YOU THINK RHYS IS GETTING ENOUGH HELP AND THE REST OF EUROPE
ONE OF THE LEADERS HAD THIS PEN THEY'VE JUST BEEN ON THE SHOULDERS OF A GREEK
I THINK THE REST OF YOUR ACTIONS YOU KNOW ABOUT IT I BELIEVE SO BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW MICKEY OF CHALLENGES WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRY A SOUR FACE
FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SLUGGED THE LENGTH OF THIS SAUCE IS RENT THOSE ARE FREE TO GO
AND COMPASSION WITH THE LEADERSHIP THE POLITICAL WILL AND COMPASSION OF EUROPE HAVE COME UNDER FIRE SINCE THE E.U. TURKEY DEAL WHICH COULD SEE MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY RISKED THEIR LIVES TO GET TO THESE ISLANDS BEING SENT
BUT THE SECRETARY GENERAL BELIEVES DESPERATE TIMES NEED DESPERATE MEASURES DO YOU I THINK YOU TALK
ALL THE AIRPORTS SHOULD BE WHAT THE LIES INCLUDING EUROPEAN UNION AND TORCHES
I'M GOING THERE FOR US AND CRUISERS OF IDEAS AND WENT VOICE ANNOYED THERE SINCE THE OLD WE WENT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HER NUMBER OF REFUGEES WHO HAD BEEN REGISTERED SHARPLY REDUCED SO I THINK WITH THIS WALKING
THE DEAL HE'S CERTAINLY CUT THE NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS DOWN TO A TRICKLE BUT FOR THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY HERE LIVING IN LIMBO IN GREECE THERE ARE NO ANSWERS AND DESPERATION IS RISING WE DON'T HAVE HOPE NOW
EVERY VIDEO MAY HAVE BEEN THERE
