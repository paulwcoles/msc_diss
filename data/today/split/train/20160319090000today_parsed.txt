IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE NINETEENTH OF MARCH GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE PRIME MINISTER HAS QUESTIONED IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S SUDDEN DECISION TO RESIGN LAST NIGHT SAYING THAT CUTS AND DISABILITY PAYMENTS HAD BEEN COLLECTIVELY AGREED WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON
MORE THAN SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE FATHER OF A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO WAS SHOT LAST MONTH IN APPARENTLY RANDOM ATTACK IN MICHIGAN THE BRAIN DIRECTOR CAME IN
AND ASKED ME IF YOU CAN HEAR ME TURN YOUR THUMBS UP SO ABI IMMEDIATELY HELD THEIR HAND UP AND TURNED THE THUMB
AND MORE ON THE METEOR THAT BRIEFLY LIT UP JOHN'S JOURNEY TO WORK ON A THURSDAY MORNING THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CAPPIE CLARKSON DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID HE'S PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION FROM THE CABINET FOR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY SHOCKED WESTMINSTER BY QUITTING UNEXPECTEDLY LAST NIGHT SIGHTING INDEFENSIBLE CHANGES TO DISABILITY BENEFITS AT A TIME OF TAX CUTS FOR THE BETTER OFF
THE PRIME MINISTER IS THOUGHT TO HAVE PERSONALLY TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO STAY BUT IN A LENGTHY AND HIGHLY CRITICAL RESIGNATION STATEMENT MISTER DUNCAN SMITH DESCRIBED PLANNED CARDS TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS AS A COMPROMISE TOO FAR MISTER CAMERON HAS INSISTED THE PROPOSALS WERE AGREED WITH MISTER DUNCAN SMITH A WEEK AGO HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
TENSIONS BETWEEN THE FORMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY AND THE CHANCE THAT HAD BEEN SIMMERING FOR SOME TIME AND HIS RESIGNATION LETTER IN DUNCAN SMITH COMPLAINED ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS HE HAD TO WORK UNDER AND WONDERED IF ENOUGH HAD BEEN DONE TO PHIL GEORGE OSBORNE'S PERSONAL PLEDGE THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
BUT WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE CAUSED LAST NIGHT'S POLITICAL EXPLOSION WAS WHEN BRIEFINGS BY GOVERNMENT SOURCES SEEM TO PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS FIRMLY AT HIS DOOR
WHILE HE HAD THE FIGHT FELT HE'D BEEN PUT UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE TREASURY TO DELIVER THEM AND MISTER DUNCAN SMITH HADN'T BEEN IMPRESSED THE NUMBERS TEN AND ELEVEN DOWNING STREET THEN SEEM TO BACK OFF FROM THE VERY PLANS HE'D BEEN ASKED TO DEFEND BUT HE ALSO FELT HE HADN'T BEEN GIVEN ENOUGH ADVANCED WARNING OF SOME OTHER BUDGET MEASURES IN PARTICULAR CUTS TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX AS HE MAKES CLEAR IN HIS LETTER HE BELIEVED CUTTING TAXATION FOR THE BETTER OFF WELL RESTRICTING ELIGIBILITY TO BENEFITS WAS POTENTIALLY TOXIC AND UNNECESSARY
I AM UNABLE TO WATCH PASSIVELY WHILST CERTAIN POLICIES ARE ENACTED IN ORDER TO MEET THE FISCAL SELF IMPOSED RESTRAINTS THAT I BELIEVE ARE MORE AND MORE PERCEIVED AS DISTINCTLY POLITICAL RATHER THAN IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST TOO OFTEN MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN PRESSURED IN THE IMMEDIATE RUN UP TO A BUDGET OR FISCAL EVENT TO DELIVER YET MORE REDUCTIONS TO THE WORKING AGE BENEFIT BILL
THE PRIME MINISTER'S REPLY TO IAIN DUNCAN SMITH LIKE THE LAVISH PRAISE THAT'S USUALLY DEEMED A COURTESY FOR DEPARTING MINISTERS AND INSTEAD HE DECLARED THEMSELF PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED BY THE RESIGNATION YOU'LL KNOW THAT WELL IN DUNCAN SMITH WANTED TO TRAIN HIS FIRE ON THE CHANCELLOR HE HAS ALSO PROVIDED PLAINTIVE AMMUNITION FOR THE OPPOSITION TO USE AGAINST THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN SAID THE RESIGNATION OF MISTER DUNCAN SMITH REVEALED A GOVERNMENT IN DISARRAY AND A CHANCELLOR WHO'D LOST THEIR CREDIBILITY TO MANAGE THE ECONOMY
AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAD THE TASK OF PUSHING THROUGH TWO OF THE GOVERNMENT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES THE SPARE ROOM SUBSIDY WHICH CRITICS DUBBED THE BEDROOM TAX AND THE SINGLE MONTHLY BENEFIT PAYMENTS UNIVERSAL CREDIT WE'RE BOTH PART OF HIS RE MET OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BE CANNON CONSIDERS MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S LEGACY AT HIS FORMER DEPARTMENT
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH CAME TO OFFICE ON A MISSION TO REFORM THE WELFARE SYSTEM HOWEVER HIS REFORMING SEWELL OFTEN CLASHED WITH TREASURY DEMANDS TO SIMPLY SAVE MONEY
MUCH OF HIS CHANGES AND THEY WERE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE WELFARE SYSTEM HOWEVER HIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL REFORM UNIVERSAL CREDIT TURNING SIX BENEFITS INTO ONE MONTHLY PAYMENT AND STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS THE CONCEPT IS WIDELY SUPPORTED BUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION LIKE SOUTHERN LOVE MISTER DUNCAN SMITH CHANGES HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS
TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OFF AND IT'S MUCH DELAYED HIS SUCCESSOR WILL KNOW HALF TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SYSTEMIC REFORM CAN ACTUALLY BE DELIVERED
OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CAN SPARK ASSESSES THE IMPACT THE RESIGNATION OF SUCH A HIGH PROFILE EUROSCEPTIC MINISTER WILL HAVE ON BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE E.U. REFERENDUM
THE QUIET MAN NO MORE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS BLOWN GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET OPEN AND HIS RESIGNATION LETTER IS ANYTHING BUT QUIET
INDEED HE'S NOW VERY PUBLIC UNHAPPINESS CREATES A LIST OF PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT ALMOST AS LONG AS HIS TWO PAGE ATTACK IT UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET AND PUTS HIS SAVINGS TARGETS AT EVEN MORE RISK IT REQUIRES MINISTERIAL MOVES DE STABILISING AT A SENSITIVE TIME
THEIR DEPARTURE BREEDS EVEN MORE ANIMOSITY INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ALREADY EMBROILED IN BITTER WRANGLING OVER THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM AND FOR A PARTY ALWAYS WITH AN EYE ON ITS FUTURE IT UNDERMINED STILL FURTHER THE CHANCELLOR'S HOPES OF SMOOTHLY SUCCEEDING DAVID CAMERON AS THE TORIES NEXT LEADER
MOST DAMAGING LAY IT CAST DOUBT ON THE GOVERNMENT'S REPEATED MANTRA THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AS THEY MAKE CUTS QUESTIONING NOT JUST THE SCALE AND PACE OF AUSTERITY BUT ITS TARGETS TOO

OVER THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS ENGLAND INSPIRED BUT EDDIE JONES AND DYLAN HARTLEY HAVE MADE STEADY AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS EACH WIN BETTER THAN THE LAST ALL IS SET FOR A VERY SPECIAL CLIMAX TO A VERY SPECIAL CAMPAIGN
THE FRENCH ON THE OTHER HAND BEGAN BADLY AND GOT STEADILY WORSE WITH EACH MATCH
IF CURRENT FORM MEANS ANYTHING AT ALL ENGLAND OUGHT TO WIN AND HAD THE GRAND SLAM TO THE TRIPLE CROWN AND THE SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP TO CAP A GLORIOUS FEW WEEKS
IAN ROBERTSON THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL THE RESIGNATION OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS A SERIOUS BLOW OBVIOUSLY FOR DAVID CAMERON HAS GIVEN LOTS OF EXCUSE ME AMMUNITION TO THE OPPOSITION HERE'S OWN SMITH THE SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY ON THE WILL TONIGHT LAST NIGHT
IF YOU AND DUNCAN SMITH HE'S SAYING IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER THAT THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE TREASURY AND GEORGE OSBORNE BUT IT SHOULD BE GEORGE OSBORNE AS RESIGNING THIS EVENING ALONGSIDE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH BUT I I CONFESS I THINK IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THESE PROTESTS A BIT TOO MUCH BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY OVER HE'S SEEN MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF CUTS TO BE DISABLED
IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK HE'S USED THE WORDS WELFARE REFORM IS AN EXCUSE FOR DISMANTLING A SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THERE WILL BE MANY TEARS FOR HIM WELL I'M JOINED BY ONE OF HIS FRIENDS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. BERNARD JENKIN AND OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON THE LETTER THAT HE WROTE CHRIS VERY POWERFUL STUFF BECAUSE HE'S CALLING TO QUESTION KAMAL'S WHOLE APPROACH TO WYLFA ZINGER OF A LETTER SO OFTEN THESE RESIGNATION LETTERS
PLENTY OF WARM WORDS AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY FIND OUT WHAT THE MINISTER OR DEPARTING MINISTER TRULY THINKS WERE IN THIS INSTANCE WE ABSOLUTELY GET THAT DETAIL PARTICULARLY WHEN HE TAKES ISSUE WITH THAT
CENTRAL SOUND BITE THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING PRETTY MUCH EVERY WEEK FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS SUGGESTING THAT THE A WHOLE MANTRA OF THE CUTS IN THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEM WAS THAT QUOTE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AREN'T SUGGESTING THAT THIS VIV'S IDEA FLOATED JUST BEFORE THE BUDGET AND THEN IN THE BUDGET DOCUMENT ITSELF IN TERMS OF THE REFORM OF THE
PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT MEANT THAT IT WAS INCREASINGLY HARD FOR THAT TASTE OF MAKE THOSE AROUND THE INTRICATE SMITH MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT WHAT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR THEM WAS THAT THEY HAD A REAL RESERVATIONS WITH THIS WITH THIS CHANGE AND YET WERE ASKED TO GO OUT AND SELL IT AND THEN
LATE YESTERDAY EVENING PRIOR TO THE RESIGNATION WHEN WE WERE TOLD THAT DOWNING STREET WAS GETTING COLD FEET AND THE WHOLE THING WAS GOING TO BE KICKED INTO THE LONG GRASS THE CLUE THE IMPLICATION OF THAT STAGE MADE IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S FAULT AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THAT WAS THE FINAL STRAW FOR HIM WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
JUST OCCASIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN OUTBREAKS OF TENSION THAT ALMOST MADE IT PUBLIC BETWEEN IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND THE CHANCELLOR WHAT'S TENDED TO HAPPEN IS A JOINTS NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WITH BOTH HAVE THEIR NAMES ON IT AS APPEARED PROCLAIMING THEIR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR JOINT ENTERPRISE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL THE REST OF IT AND THE WHOLE THING'S GONE AWAY FOR A WHILE THIS CLEARLY THAT A MOMENTARY BECAUSE WITH THAT HE FELT THAT YOU JUST COULDN'T PUT UP WITH IT ANY LONGER THERE WILL BE SOME WHO WILL THINK THAT PERHAPS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
E.U. REFERENDUM WHERE OF COURSE HE IS ON ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT BUT AS CAMERON AND OSBORNE ARE ON THE OTHER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN REPLACED ANYWAY AND SO IF HE WANTED A MOMENT TO SAY HIS PIECE PERHAPS NOW WAS IT LITTLE OR DONE NO HARM TO THE OAT CAMPAIGN NO AND IT WILL MEAN THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO BE ENTIRELY SORT OF FREE AND FRANK IN A WAY THAT PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE REMOVAL OF COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AROUND THE CABINET TABLE
HE'D HAVE BEEN VERY CONSCIOUS THAT HE STILL OPERATING WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE IN THE DAILY MAIL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN WHICH IT WAS PRETTY CRITICAL OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF THE TONE AND THEIR APPROACH TO THE THE PRO E.U. CAMPAIGN IN PARTICULAR THE FRUSTRATION FROM SOME ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ARGUMENTS YOU HAVE SAID
HOW COME THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHERS WERE WILLING TO SAY THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO THAT THEY WOULD ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE THE E.U. IN THE MINUTE THEY GET THE DEAL THEY SUDDENLY THINK THAT THE IDEA OF LEAVING WOULD BE AT THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT SO THE CONTEXT IS CLEARLY I THINK THE THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE SPECIFIC IS VERY MUCH ON WELFARE REFORM INDEED THANKS FOR THAT ER BERNARD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING BUT THE TIMING TOOK TIME TO CREATE THE MAXIMUM DAMAGE
THE TIMING CAME AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO ME THAT IT IF IF ANYTHING I MEAN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH IAN OVER THE YEARS LOOK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN EUROPE HOW CAN YOU STAY IN THE GOVERNMENT BUT HE'S ALSO
MADE IT VERY VERY CLEAR ALWAYS THAT THIS JOB WHICH HAS BECOME HIS LIFE'S VOCATION REFORMING THE WELFARE SYSTEM TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE
BACK TO WORK TO TRY AND GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES EVER SINCE HE BECAME LEADER
WENT THROUGH SOMETHING OF A CHANGE IN HIS WHOLE PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE HE WAS EXPOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO SERIOUS DEPRIVATION THAT FAMOUS VISIT TO GO ALLIGATOR IN GLASGOW
WHICH CHANGED HIS WHOLE PERSPECTIVE THEN HE SET UP THE CENTRE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND REALLY DEVOTED HIS LIFE
TO MAKING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY A PARTY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND I THINK THAT THE
THE PERIOD OF SIX YEARS DOING THIS JOB HAS BEEN A CONSTANT BATTLE WITH THE TREASURY WHO GENERALLY TAKEN A VERY SHORT TERM VIEW OF WELFARE REFORM GENERALLY ALWAYS SOUGHT TO CHEESE PARED DOWN THE WELFARE BUDGET IN ADVANCE OF EVERY AUTUMN STATEMENT OF EVERY BUDGET NOT INTERESTED IN THE LONG TERM BENEFITS OF REFORMING WELFARE TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK ACTUALLY RATHER DEROGATORY OF
IAN'S PLANS AND I'M AFRAID I THINK THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN THE LAST STRAW THE ONE THING ABOUT IAN IS HE IS AN EXTREMELY COMMITTED AND PRINCIPLED PERSON
I THINK THE THE THE PRESENT CONSERVATIVE REGIME HAVE FOUND THAT RATHER DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET AS IAN POINTS OUT IN HIS LETTERS A LETTER THEY'VE ALWAYS TENDED TO BE VERY POLITICAL VERY TACTICAL VERY CLEVER
I MEAN THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF PROTECTING PENSIONERS TO THE ENTS DEGREE TO THE POINT WHERE WE KEEP THEIR FUEL ALLOWANCES AND THEY'RE FREE BUS PASSES HOWEVER MUCH IT COSTS BUT WE CARRY ON BASHING YOUNG PEOPLE AND DISABLED PEOPLE THIS ISN'T ABOUT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IT'S ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO SAY WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THAT THROUGH THAT HE IS SENDING WHICH IS THAT WE ARE NOT TRULY ALL IN THIS TOGETHER HOW MUCH WILL THAT RESONATE IN THE TORY PARTY
I THINK A LOT OF COLLEAGUES WOULD BE EXTREMELY ANNOYED AT THIS EXPLOSION BUT THEY WILL NOT BE SURPRISED YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LED UP THE HILL AND DOWN THE HILL BY THE CHANCE OF THE EXCHEQUER
WE WERE TOLD WE WERE GOING TO REFORM TAX CREDITS SOME OF US WARNED HIM QUITE QUICKLY THAT THIS WAS A REALLY A STEP TOO FAR AND THEN SUDDENLY HE HAD TONS OF MONEY IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND DANDY AND NOW HE'S RUNNING OUT OF MONEY AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A LITTLE
A LITTLE IMPATIENT WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S GYRATIONS I MEAN HE ACCUSES THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BRIEFING AGAINST IAIN DUNCAN SMITH NOW THAT HE WASN'T AND I AM NOT ABLE TO STICK TO HIS OWN SPENDING LIMITS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHANCES OWN FORECASTS THEY'VE GYRATED AROUND FAR LARGER FIGURES I MEAN NOT ENTIRELY ALL HIS FAULT OF COURSE BUT I THINK THE HIGH HANDED AND SHORT TERM EST POLITICAL APPROACH
THE CHANCELLOR HAS TENDED TO TAKE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER DEPARTMENT WILL BUDGETS HAS TESTED THE PATIENTS HAVE MORE THAN ONE MINISTER BUT DRINKING MANY THANKS THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A PLANE CARRYING SIXTY ONE PEOPLE HAS CRASHED AS IT WAS COMING INTO LAND IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA KILLING EVERYONE ON BOARD OUR CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG JOINS US FROM MOSCOW DO WE KNOW YET WHAT HAPPENED STEVE
THE INVESTIGATION IS UNDER WAY THIS WAS A FLY DUBAI FLIGHT FLIGHT NINE EIGHT ONE THAT WAS EN ROUTE FROM DUBAI TO SOUTHERN RUSH IT WAS TRYING TO LAND AT ROSTOV AIRPORT IT OR REMADE ONE PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO LAND IN POOR WEATHER BUT IT HAD TO ABANDON THAT AND THEN ENTER A HOLDING PATTERN AND SECOND TIME ROUND THE AIRCRAFT HIT THE GROUND AND BROKE INTO PIECES
A SECURITY CAMERA SOME DISTANCE AWAY CALL THAT THE FINAL SECONDS OF THE OF THE BOEING SEVEN THREE SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND AFTER THE CRASH YOU CAN SEE THERE'S AN EXPLOSION AND A HUGE FLASH WHICH LIGHTS UP THE SKY AS YOU SAID
ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE KILLED NO SURVIVORS AND AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN OPEN THE FACT THAT IT WAS COMING IN FROM THE MIDDLE EAST OR RAISE ANY FEARS THAT THE FOUL PLAY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT THE SHARM EL SHEIKH FLIGHT
I THINK INITIALLY IT DID BUT SUBSEQUENTLY IT SEEMS THAT RUSSIA'S INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE IS FOCUSING ON TWO MAIN THEORY SEE POSSIBLE PILOT ERROR
BECAUSE OF THE POOR WEATHER AND THE WEATHER WAS BAD THE WIND WAS VERY STRONG POOR VISIBILITY AND THE ROSTOV WEATHER CENTRE HAD ISSUED A STORM WARNING ACTUALLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THAT SO THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE THEORY THE OTHER ONE IS SOME KIND OF TECHNICAL PROBLEM ON BOARD IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF TERRORISM IS BEING LOOKED AT AS AS AS A PRIMARY THEORY
STEVE ROSENBERG IN MOSCOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN EXCUSE ME WE KNOW A BIT MORE NOW ABOUT THAT METEOR DELIGHTED PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN IT BURNED UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THURSDAY MORNING I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY RICHARD CATTERICK WHO IS THE FOUNDER
OF THE U.K. MEATIER AREN'T NETWORK AND YOU KNOW WHAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING MISTER CATTERICK HELLO GOOD MORNING IT WASN'T FOUR YEARS AGO HE'S FROM FAIRLY NEW IS IT RIGHT AND YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING THE METEOR WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT IT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME
WELL I'VE GOT SOME FRESH INFORMATION FROM ABOUT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT SO IT IS PRETTY FRESH
AND HOW BIG WAS THE METEOR THAT'S THE THING WE ALL WANT TO KNOW I SUPPOSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS AS BIG AS A LORRY NOW WASN'T THAT BIG BOSS IT'S WE
SOME HELP RUNNING SOME NUMBERS WITH THE GUYS AND THE INITIAL MINUS ONE HUNDRED AND NINE KILOGRAMS SO AS PROBABLY ABOUT BASKETBALL
O.K. RIGHT SO QUITE MODEST TO CREATE SUCH A BIG FLASH I AND IT WAS ENORMOUS WASN'T IT AND VERY BEAUTIFUL IT WAS DEFINITELY IT WAS VERY BRIGHT NEARLY AS
ALL WARM AND IT WAS SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EIGHT OF OUR CAMERAS RECORDED THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE GOT IT MORE ON MORE THAN ONE AND IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE AS WELL
I SEE SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAN BE SO DEFINITE ABOUT THE SIZE AND ALL THE REST OF IT BUT TELL ME HOW SUCH A DAD IT BIG IN TERMS OF METEORS OBVIOUSLY BUT NONETHELESS NOT ALL THAT BIG WHY HOW DOES IT CREATE SUCH A A GREAT DISPLAYS IT IT BECAUSE OF THE SPEED IT'S TRAVELLING AT IS THAT IT
YES THE SPEED IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ALL THIS AS IT TRAVELS
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND WE'VE CALCULATED THE SPEED TO BE FORTY THREE POINT FIVE KILOMETRES PER SECOND THAT TRANSLATES TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR
FIVE THAT IS FAST AND AS IT'S TRAVELLING
IT'S BURNING UP THERE THE ROCK IS IT WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY BURNT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ROCK CAN'T BURN CAN IT WHAT'S UP TO BE HAPPENING TO THE ROCK IS THE PRESSURE AS IT PASSES THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE IT HEATS UP THE AIR AROUND IT AND CREATES TENSION
AND THAT OBVIOUSLY CREATES A LIGHT SORT OF IT'S BURNING AND AS IT GOES INTO CRITICAL PHASES THEN HE'D EVEN EXPLODES AND IN OUR CASE TWICE OH I SEE SO THAT THE GREAT FLASH THAT ONE SEES IS THE ROCKET SELF EXPLODING
BECAUSE IF YOU I MEAN IF YOU HEAT A PIECE OF ROCK I DON'T KNOW WELL IT IN A VOLCANO I SUPPOSE THERE THE ROCK SPEWS OUT DID GET SO HOT THAT IT MELTS I SORT OF ASSUMED THAT THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE MEDIA BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE
A KIND OF FIT HE'S CITIES AS IT PASSES THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE IT HEATS UP SO THEN
THERE WILL BE SOME MELTING POINT DEPENDING OBVIOUSLY ON THE COMPOSITION AND IN OUR CASE WE WOULD SAY PROBABLY A QUANDARY
THEN IT DOES EVAPORATE COMPLETELY EVEN THOSE HUNDRED NINE KILOGRAMS THAT ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE DIDN'T SURVIVE IT THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO FAST DID NOT SURVIVE AT ALL JUST AS WHAT ABOUT A DROP ON OR ED'S MIGHT NEVER THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RICHARD THAT'S BRILLIANT THANKS A LOT NO IT'S PLATO
IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BENEFITS CUTS TO THE DISABLED A DEFENSIBLE IN NARROW TERMS BUT NOT WITHIN HER BUDGET THAT GIVES TO HIRE EARNING TAXPAYERS ONE OF THE CHARGES LEVELLED BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER IN WHICH HE ALSO RAILED AGAINST SALAMI SLICING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S VISION OF A NEW WELFARE TO WORK SYSTEM WE'RE JOINED NOW BY JONATHAN PORTERS WHO WAS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS AND IS NOW AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH GOOD MORNING
DOES IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAVE A POINT WHEN HE SUGGESTS THAT HIS PLANS FOR INCENTIVISING TOWARDS WORKING AND AWAY FROM WELFARE HAVE BEEN CHIPPED AWAY AT HE CERTAINLY DOES WIN IAN DUNCAN SMITH FIRST ANNOUNCED HIS PLANS FOR UNIVERSAL CREDIT HIS BIG IDEA TO UNIFY THE BENEFIT SYSTEM THAT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN BENEFITS SPENDING AND QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE A LOT BETTER OFF ESPECIALLY LOW PAID WORKING PEOPLE IN ON SHORT HOURS JOBS BECAUSE OF THE VARIOUS
CUTS CHIPPINGS AWAY IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE THAT PLAN WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TAX CREDIT CUTS OR GEORGE OSBORNE AND OUTCLASSED
LAST JULY WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN DITCHED IT ALL THEY'VE SIMPLY BEEN ROLLED INTO THE FUTURE UNIVERSAL CREDIT SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THAT UNIVERSAL CREDIT WILL NOW ACTUALLY REPRESENT A VERY SIGNIFICANT CUT ON THE PRESENT SYSTEM
SO HIS BIG IDEA CREDIT IS STILL THERE IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK OR HELPING PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIVING EXPENSES IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST ANY LONGER AND THE GIVEN THAT WAS HIS BRAINCHILD THAT PRETTY BIG DEAL BUT THE THE WELFARE CUTS THAT WERE PART OF THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO LAST YEAR
MUST HAVE SIGNED UP TO THEM THEY WERE THEY WERE PART OF OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THEY CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO SET OUT EXPLICIT PROMISED TO CUT WELFARE ABOUT TWELVE BILLION POUNDS AT THE SAME TIME AS IT SET OUT AN EXPLICIT PROMISE TO CUT TAXES THE BENEFITS OF WHICH INEVITABLY WILL GO MOSTLY TO PEOPLE ON MIDDLE AND ESPECIALLY ON UPPER ENCAMPED THROWING NOTICE WHICH WAS VERY MUCH SIGNED UP TO THIS
BUT I SUSPECT HE DIDN'T NOT REALLY FULLY THINK THROUGH WHAT THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE BOTH FREE UNIVERSAL CREDIT
FOR A DISABILITY BENEFITS AND DISABILITY BENEFITS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU DID THE IDEA OF THESE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT WAS TO BRING THE BILL DOWN FROM WHAT WAS THE DISABILITY LIVING ALLOWANCE AND YET IT IS FORECAST TO DO QUITE THE OPPOSITE THAT'S RIGHT AND THIS GOES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SO WE GET SOMETHING THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SIGNED UP TO NOT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ACTUALLY BUT SIXTY YEARS AGO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHAMFERS NUMBERS
THE TREASURY FORCED IAIN DUNCAN SMITH TO COMMIT TO A TWENTY PERCENT CUT IN DISABILITY LIVING ALLOWANCE WHAT'S NOW BECOME PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT COMPARED TO THE PROJECTIONS BUT BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY ONCE THEY STARTED RE TESTING PEOPLE THEY DISCOVERED THAT CONFLICT THE RHETORIC THAT REALLY A LOT OF SCROUNGERS OR PEOPLE WHO ARE FAKING THEIR CONDITIONS MOST PEOPLE CLAIMING D.L.A. ARE NOW CLAIMING WHAT'S CALLED THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT
DO YOU HAVE GENUINE NEEDS THEY FELT THEY COULDN'T MAKE THOSE CUTS AFTER ALL THIS IS A BACK DOOR AWAY THE CUTS ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK BACK TO A WAY OF TRYING TO RESTORE SOME OF THEIR SAVINGS TO ORIGINALLY PLANNED ALL WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THEY COULDN'T FIND THE SAVINGS THEIR HOPEFUL BUT THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY THE BILL IS PROJECTED TO GO UP AS SHARPLY AS IT IS WELL BELIEVED ALLOWED SHE'S ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY NEW BENEFIT FOR THOSE OF US IN SOCIAL SECURITY THAT IT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES SO IT'S STILL MATURING AS IT
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE POPULATION AND PARTICULARLY TO THOSE OF PENSION AGE SO A LOT OF THIS EXPANSION WAS ACTUALLY IT WAS ACTUALLY FORESEEABLE RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE OTHER PART OF IT OF COURSE IS THAT WE ARE FAR MORE PEOPLE ON DISABILITY BENEFITS THESE DATE HAD MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WERE MUCH BETTER AT RECOGNISING FOR
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR ILL THOSE ARE ABROAD SOCIAL TREND TOWARDS RECOGNISING THE CONSEQUENCE OF IMPLICATIONS OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WOULD JUST IT WAS JUST WASN'T THERE TWENTY YEARS AND SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE PREDICTED INCREASE IN THE BILL DOES REFLECT GENUINE NEED RATHER THAN A PROBLEM WITH THAT WITH THE WAY PEOPLE ARE BEING ASSESSED WHICH THEN SUGGEST THAT THIS IS NOT A GROUP THAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CUT
AT ALL OR AT LEAST NOT SIGNIFICANT I THINK WHAT WE FOUND IT WE FOUND THIS IT'S NOT JUST FOR THIS BENEFIT REMEMBER THAT THE EMPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT ALLOWANCE THE REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO SPIT SAVE EVEN MORE MONEY BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY A MILLION PEOPLE ON INCAPACITY BENEFITS WERE SUPPOSEDLY FIT TO WORK WE FOUND OUT OF COURSE THAT WENT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH
RUSHED THROUGH THE NEW TESTING PROGRAMME THAT LOTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLASSIFIED FIT FOR WORK WEREN'T FIT FOR WORK AT ALL AND AFTER APPEAL
AND THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE BREAKDOWN SYSTEM IT'S TURNED OUT THAT ROUGHLY THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE STILL ON THIS BENEFIT WHERE THIS IS GOOD OR BAD IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY BUT THE FACT THAT WE RECOGNISE DISABILITY MUCH MORE THAN WE USED TO RECOGNISE DIFFERENT FORMS OF DISABILITY DIFFERENT NEED THAT IS A WIDER SOCIAL TREND THAT HE DIDN'T GO TO REVERSE ANY FUNNY DID YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO NOW A LOOK AT THOSE THE PENSIONERS PARTICULARLY THE WEALTHIER PENSIONERS IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THIS GOAL OF OF TACKLING WELFARE SPENDING ANY
RAILWAY WELL THERE ARE CHOICES AND I THINK IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS MADE THEM PERFECTLY CLEAR YOU CAN CHOOSE FOR EXAMPLE NOT
TAXES FOR RICH PEOPLE WHICH IS WHAT CAPITAL GAINS TAX OR INDEED THE HIGHER RATE TAX CUTS WHICH WILL BENEFIT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME REPRESENTS OR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO ADDRESS THE BETTER OFF PENSIONERS BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE SOME RECOGNITION THAT ACTUALLY SIMPLY TRYING TO SALAMI SLICER DISABILITY BENEFITS BILL IS BOTH
TURNS OUT TO BE VERY INHUMANE IN PRACTICE AND ALSO HE'S NOT GOING LIVE WITH THE GUP RESULTS GOVERNMENT WANTS JONATHAN PORTERS THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN GARY SPORT JOHN MICHEL GOOD MORNING A GREAT CRICKET STORY TO REFLECT ON THIS MORNING ENGLAND CHASING A RECORD TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN THE WORLD T.

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT ON FEBRUARY THE TWENTIETH EIGHT PEOPLE IN THE SMALL TOWN OF CALUM A ZOO WEST OF DETROIT WAS SHOT IN A GUN RAMPAGE BLAMED ON AN ENGLISH DRIVER WHO WAS PICKING UP PASSENGERS IN BETWEEN THE ATTACKS SIX PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING FALL WHO WERE SITTING IN A PARKED CAR
ALSO IN THAT CAR WAS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ABIGAIL COP WHO WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD SHE'D BEEN OUT WITH A FAMILY FRIEND BARBARA HAWTHORN A WOMAN SHE REGARDED AS HER GRANDMOTHER THE GIRL'S PARENTS WERE TOLD IN HOSPITAL THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO SAVE HER AND THEN AS HER FATHER JEAN KOPF HAS BEEN TELLING US SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED
THEY HIT THE HOSPITAL I'M ALL RIGHT DOWN BECAUSE THE SHOOTER WAS STILL ABOUT THE CITY THEY WERE UP TO A ROOM THEY WANT JUST WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE AND WE WENT INTO HER ROOM AFTER WORDS
THAT'S FOR A RE SARA IN THE STATE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DESCRIBE BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE HEAD THAT WAS HER CONDITION THERE WAS A CONDITION AND THAT SCREWS THEM ENOUGH AND WHAT THEN HAPPENED WHAT DID THE DOCTORS TELL YOU THEY SAID HE WON'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT IT WAS VERY BLEAK
AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER WORDS WE WERE JUST HOLDING HANDS SHORTLY THEREAFTER WORDS HER HEART STOPPED BEATING L'ETRANGER REVIVER WOULD SEEM A WHILE STORY SURE THAT START
SO THEY CALLED HER TIME
ONE ME COLD IT CODING IN DOCTOR PARLANCE MEANS DEBT EVER SEES
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT TIME OF DEATH BUT IT'S IS THE TIME OF DEATH THAT I WANTED ALL THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS ALL IT ALL GAVE THAT WERE IN ALL SORTS OF TECHNICAL MEDICAL TERMS THAT AS FAR AS THE DOCTORS WERE CONCERNED THEY COULD DO NOTHING MORE FOR HER THERE IS CORRECT HER HE'D STABBED BEADING AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT AND THEN MY WIFE AND I WERE ALL IN HER HAND IN MY WAY NOT
BUT SHE SWIRLED WITH A PULSE SO SHE TOLD THE NURSE THE NURSE TOLD HER THAT IT'S NATURAL FOR BARRY'S TO TWITCH
BUT MY WIFE INSISTED CHECK THE NURSE NOTICED THERE WAS A PULSE ALTHOUGH IT WAS WEAK SO SHE CALLED THE TEAM IN
HE BROUGHT BACK THE VENTILATOR HOOKED MADE ON HER BACK UP TO THE VENTILATOR IN THERE SHE SAYS WE ALL THEIR HANDS FOR MANY HOURS
AND WE WERE ALL AFTER TALKING WITH THE DOCTORS THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY BRAIN DEAD THERE WAS NO
THERE WAS THAT DECLARED BRAIN DEATH IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE DECLARED IMMEDIATELY BUT THEY JUST SAID IN ALL PROBABILITY SHE WAS BRAINDEAD BUT SHE WAS PHYSICALLY ALIVE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT GIVEN WHAT YOU HAD PREPARED YOURSELVES FOR
IT IS IF YOU DON'T PREPARE YOURSELF FOR A FEW HOURS AGO YOU SORT YOUR DAUGHTER WAS FINE SHE WAS AN OUTING WITH HER GRANDMOTHER SO THERE WAS NO PREPARATION YEAH IT WAS A SHACK NONE OF IT SEEMED IT WAS ALSO A REAL SO THERE WAS NO PREPARATION BUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT HOW DID HOW DID ABIGAIL'S CONDITION START TO IMPROVE
MY WIFE WAS HOLDING HER HAND AND MY GIRLS NEVER LIKED HOLDING HANDS IN A TRADITIONAL FASHION SHE'S ALWAYS PREFERRED INTERLACED FINGERS
AND SHE KEPT UNHOOKING MADE MY DAUGHTER YOU'RE KEPT UNHOOKING HER HAND FROM MY WAIST FINGERY IAN'S IN FINGERS
SO MY WIFE INSISTED THAT DOCTORS ARE EXCELLENT NURSE AND HER ROOM NOTICED THAT FIRST YEAR BUT LATER
I'VE NURSED DID AGREE SHE SAW THAT HAPPEN
SO IF YOU GO DOWN THE DOCTOR'S BROUGHT HER BACK DOWN FOR ANOTHER CAT SCAN THE BRAIN DIRECTOR CAME IN
AND ASKED ME IF YOU CAN HEAR ME TURN YOUR THUMBS UP SO ABI HELD HER IMMEDIATELY HELD THEIR HAND UP AND TURNED THE THUMB
LOT OF YARD POLICY BECAUSE THEY CAN HEAR IT FEEL SO AT THAT POINT THEY WERE FOR BRAIN SURGERY
AND WHAT WERE YOUR EMOTIONS IN IN SEEING HER DO THAT
I HAD NO EMOTIONS AT THE END IT WAS ALSO A REAL IT WAS A STATE EVERYTHING WAS A TOTAL SHOCK IT'S LIKE ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED DREAMS WERE YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING YOU KNOW IT'S A DREAM AND IT WAS THE STATE IT WAS JUST A REALLY BAD DREAM WRITTEN AS JUST WAITING FOR IT TO END SO SHE HAD SURGERY AND HOW IS SHE NOW
SHE IS WHY SHOULD HE WHAT YESTERDAY SHE WHAT A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED METRES GIVE OR TAKE A LITTLE BIT
SHE CAN TALK BUT HER VOLUME IS VERY VERY LOW THE EVENTS ON THE VENTILATOR AND STUFF HERE HAVE MADE HER DIAPHRAGM WEEK WHICH IS BEING WORKED AND SHE HAS A POOR VOCABULARY SHE HAS BEEN RIDING FOR QUITE A WHILE
BUT SHE HAS A FOG VOCABULARY AND SPEAK BUT THE VINE A AS THOUGH
I THINK YOUR COMPUTER AREA TELEVISION ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THEN YOU TURN IT UP ONE NATCH ABOVE BARE BOTTOM
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO HER THERE'S ONE DOCTOR TURNED IT WHEN SHE STARTED COMING BACK AND THIS IS VERY CLEAR THE LILT OF THE LIGHT MORE BIZARRE
IT'S BLIND SHE'S THERE BUT FROM WHAT SHE IS SAYING AND FROM WHAT SHE IS WRITING DOES SHE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
THAT'S HARD TO SAY IT WE HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THAT THE DIARIES OF WIND US FIRST OF ALL SHE'S DEFINITELY HAVING SOME POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SO WE DON'T A EXACERBATE THERE BUT I'M TOP OF THAT THE DOCTORS HAVE WARNED US THAT WAS VERY COMMON
VICTOR AND OF CAMEL LIKE THIS TO GET THINGS AND SAYS DON'T MIND ABHORS A VACUUM IF YOU SAY ANYTHING TO THEM THEY WERE ALL PUT THERE IAN BACK TO FILL IN THE BLACK SO IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD JUST BY SAYING ANYTHING EXTRA
HEAT HER MEMORY WITH FALSE MEMORIES
BUT HAVE YOU TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY
SHE'S ASKED IF SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD AND SHE AND WE CAN'T FIND IT THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT EARTH TOLD US TO DO IS TO CONFIRM IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING RIGHT AND WE DID MENTION THAT HER GRANDMOTHER WAS SHE DID
OUTSIDE OF THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO A GREAT DEAL OF DETAIL WAITING FOR HER TO ASK QUESTIONS RABBIT AND AS TO THROW THINGS
NOT LONG AFTER THE SHOOTING YOU SPOKE AT ONE OF THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE WHERE YOU YOU BROUGHT UP GUN CONTROL DIRECTLY WITH HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SAUNDERS WHAT WAS THE POINT YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE
IT'S A POINT THAT PROBABLY EVERYONE IN EUROPE WHAT I KNOW MOST PEOPLE IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN WANDERING IN THERE IT IS WHAT'S QUITE OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND GUNS THERE IS NO OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY THERE'S HAVING MASS SHOOTINGS LIKE UNITED STATES AND THERE IT IS A HUGE GUN CULTURE HERE
AND I WAS TRYING TO BRING IT UP IT'S SOMETHING ONCE YOU MUST BE ADDRESSED EITHER OUR COUNTRY

EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TO LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION WAS THE AWKWARDLY TIME FOR THEIR FIRST EDITIONS BUT IT DID MAKE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES ON THE TELEGRAPH AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REWRITES BY THE OTHERS
LEAVING MOST OF THE PEOPLES OF THE LATER EDITIONS OF TIMES POINTS OUT THAT HIS DEPARTURE THE FIRST BY A CABINET MINISTER FOR TWO YEARS CAME IN SPITE OF A U. TURN BY THE CHANCELLOR OVER THE BUDGET CUTS THAT HAD PROMPTED IT THE TELEGRAPH SAYS GEORGE OSBORNE'S OFFERED TO DELAY THE CHANGES TO DISABILITY BENEFITS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT MISTER DUNCAN SMITH WALKING OUT AND HIS SHOCK RESIGNATION THREATENS TO THROW THE GOVERNMENT INTO DISARRAY IN THE GUARDIAN'S CARTOONIST DRAWS ONE SHOWS A MAGICIAN SAWING HIMSELF IN HALF AND EVISCERATING HIMSELF IN THE PROCESS
THE CAPTION THE UNBELIEVABLE GEORGE AND HE'S ETERNALLY UNRAVELLING BUDGET THE FINANCIAL TIMES NOTES AT MISTER DUNCAN SMITH AS A LEADING CAMPAIGNER FOR BRECHT CERTAIN SAYS FEW RESIGNATIONS IN RECENT TIMES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED TO INFLICT SO MUCH COLLATERAL DAMAGE IT BELIEVES ANY PROSPECT OF A RESTRAINED TO DEBATE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OVER EUROPE HAS BEEN BLOWN APART WRITING IN THE DAILY MIRROR THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN URGES READERS TO SIGN A PETITION DEMANDING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WITHDRAW THEIR DISABILITY CUTS
HE SAYS THE OFFER OF CONSULTATION IS NOT ENOUGH AND PROMISES TO FORCE A VOTE IN PARLIAMENT THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THE SCOTLAND YARD'S PLANNING TO ANNOUNCE ON MONDAY THAT IT IS SHUTTING DOWN OPERATION MIDLAND THAT SEA INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD SEX ABUSE AND MURDERED BY SENIOR POLITICIANS ARMY AND INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE INQUIRY IS TAKEN SIXTEEN MONTHS IT'S COST AN ESTIMATED TWO MILLION POUNDS AND INVOLVED RAIDS ON THE HOMES OF LORD BRAMALL LORD BRITAIN AND THE FORMER M.P. HARVEY PROCTOR
QUOTES A SOURCE CLOSE TO OPERATION MIDLAND DESCRIBING IT AS A DISASTER THE TELEGRAPH UNDERSTANDS MY PROCTOR THE LAST LIVING PERSON STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION WILL BE TOLD HE FACES NO FURTHER ACTION THE REST OF THE PARIS ATTACK SUSPECT CELLAR ABDUS SALAM IN BRUSSELS IS WIDELY COVERED IMAGES OF ARMED POLICE PINNING A HOODED SUSPECT AGAINST A CAR APPEAR ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE INDEPENDENT AND THE TIMES THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE CAPTURE OF EUROPE'S MOST WANTED MAN IS FAR FROM THE END OF THE INVESTIGATION WITH MANY MORE PEOPLE BEING SOUGHT
FINALLY THE LIVES ARE OUT OF THE WORLD MARMALADE AWARDS YES THE WORLD MARMALADE AWARDS IN CUMBRIA THIS WEEKEND ACCORDING TO THE TIMES IT SAID WAR HAS BROKEN OUT OVER THE ORIGINS OF MARMALADE AND JUDGES HAVE NOTICED A SURGEON ENTRIES FROM NORTH OF THE BORDER WHICH SIT CHARACTERISES AS AN OFFENSIVE TO RECLAIM THE QUINTESSENTIALLY ENGLISH SPREAD FOR SCOTLAND SIXTEEN SCOTTISH CLANS HAVE SUBMITTED JARS OB HOMEMADE MARMALADE
SON DECORATED IN CLAN TARTAN WHERE IS THIS GOING TO END THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A NEW WEEKLY MEET THE AUTHOR INTERVIEW AND THIS WEEK JIM IS TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO CRIME
SOPHIE HANNAH IS A CRIME WRITER WHO CRAFT PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERS PEOPLED WITH CYNICS AND MANY QUITE UNLOVABLE CHARACTERS BUT SHE'S ALSO A CHILD OF THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE DETECTIVE STORY SHE WAS ASKED BY THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ESTATE TO WRITE TO PYRO NOVELS AND UNDER THE GRITTY DARK SUFFERERS OF HER LATEST BOOK THE NARROW BED
LIES A QUITE TRADITIONAL FIENDISH PLOT THAT HE IS LOYAL
TO THE GENRE WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO TALK WE BEGAN WITH THE OPENING OF THE NARROW BED WHICH HE READ
HERE'S MY TIP FOR ANYONE UNDER SCRUTINY FROM THE POLICE AS SOON AS YOU TRY TO HIDE SOMETHING YOU MAKE IT GLARINGLY VISIBLE LIKE THE BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES THAT ARE SOMETIMES WRAPPED IN WHITE CLOTH BY ARTISTS MAKING EVERYONE STARE AND POINT AT THEM
ALL OFF THE CLOTH OFF AND YOU'VE GOT AN UNREMARKABLE OFFICE BLOCK OR A CONGESTED COMMUTER ROUTE ACROSS WATER PEOPLE WALK PAST WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN OBLIVION
TELL THE POLICE THE TRUTH IMMEDIATELY AND IN DETAIL AND NO ONE WILL PAY A SCRAP OF ATTENTION
THIS BOOK HAS REAL ELEMENTS IT HAS A STRUCTURE THAT SOMETIMES QUITE COMPLEX THERE'S A
BOOK RUNNING THROUGH IT WHICH IS WRITTEN BY THE MAIN CHARACTER THAN PIECES OF JOURNALISM THAT FIT INTO THE PATTERN SO IT'S AN EXTREMELY WELL I THINK IT IS A DARK VIEW OF OUR CONTEMPORARY WORLD ISN'T IT A DARK VIEW OF THE PRESSURES THAT EXIST ON THE PEOPLE WHO MOVE THROUGH THESE PAGES
IT MUST BE DARK BECAUSE PEOPLE TELL ME IT IS FULL AND THERE'S ALSO A SERIAL KILLER ON THE LOOSE YES BUT I MEAN I THINK WHAT I TRY TO DO IS WRITE ABOUT THE WORLD AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU KNOW HOWEVER JOLLY ONE IT IS
ONE CANNOT AVOID THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SOME FROM QUITE DANGEROUS AND UNPLEASANT THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD ALL AROUND US YOU KNOW QUITE A LOT OF THE MORE LIGHT HEARTED BANTER BETWEEN THE DETECTIVES IN ALL OF MY BOOKS IS A SORT OF
AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW THAT ACTUALLY IN IN THE REAL WORLD
LIGHT AND DARK ARE MIXED IN TOGETHER ALL THE TIME AND IT'S THE LIGHTNESS THAT ENABLES US TO TO COPE WITH THE DARKNESS AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DARK GETS YOU REALLY EXPLORING THE NATURE OF
WE CALL EVIL I'M TRYING TO SUGGEST IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S LURKING UNDER THE SURFACE IN PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHICH THEY ARE QUITE OFF
YES AND I THINK RATHER THAN INSOFAR AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT THE CRIME NOVEL DIVIDES CHARACTERS UP INTO THE GOOD ONES WHO HAVEN'T COMMITTED A MURDER AND THE EVIL ONES YOU HAVE I THINK THAT'S A VERY SIMPLISTIC VIEW I TRY TO WRITE BOOKS IN WHICH THE GOODIES AND THE BADDIES FOR WANT OF BETTER WORDS HAVE
IMPULSES TO DO GOOD AND IMPULSES TO DO HARM AND THEY'RE ALL JUMBLED UP TOGETHER THE MURDERER IS ALMOST ALWAYS IN MY BOOK SOMEONE WHO HAS JUST BEEN PUSHED TOO FAR THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ESTATE ASKED YOU TO WRITE A COUPLE OF PORNO NOVELS WHICH IS
TREMENDOUS ACCOLADE AND THE SECOND ONE I THINK IT'S COMING OUT IN SEPTEMBER YES HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH THE BUSINESS OF APPROACHING
THIS FABLED FIGURE MY FAIRLY SOON REALISED THAT THE ONLY REASON I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT IS THAT I HAD ALREADY
STARTED WRITING AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVELS SOME IN MY FIRST NOVEL LITTLE FACE AND EVERY NOVEL I'VE WRITTEN SINCE THEN LONG BEFORE I WAS ASKED TO WRITE A PYRO
HAD THOSE KIND OF AGATHA CHRISTIE ISH ELEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE A PLOP HOOK THAT'S NOT JUST HERE'S A DEAD BODY LET'S FIND OUT WHO KILLED THE DEAD BODY AND I'VE BEEN HAVING SORT OF DAY NEW MONTHS WHERE ALL THE SUSPECTS ARE GATHERED MY NEW BOOK THE NARROW BED
ENDS WITH ALL THE SUSPECTS BEING GATHERED BY THE DETECTIVE AND EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED IN THE TRADITION YES BUT IT'S NOT IN HER DRAWING ROOM AS IT WOULD BE AN AGATHA CHRISTIE IT'S IN AN INDIAN RESTAURANT FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON TO DO WITH THE PLOT SO I KIND OF REALISED THAT ALL ALONG I'D BEEN WRITING ACCORDING TO THE AGATHA BLUEPRINT AND THAT I SHARED ALL OF HER STORYTELLING PRIORITIES AND SO ACTUALLY
THE ADDED INGREDIENT OF PYRO WAS IT WAS JUST SORT OF LIKE A BRILLIANT BONUS TO BE ABLE TO TO WRITE ABOUT HIM
SOPHIE HANNAH AUTHOR OF THE NARROW BED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE TELEVISION VERSION OF JIM'S INTERVIEW WITH SOPHIE HANNAH IT'S ON THE B.B.C.
IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING MARTIN ROLL WRITER AND JOURNALIST MORNING MARTIN GOOD MORNING AS THE BUSES TRUNDLED BY PASSING PEDESTRIANS LOOK ON QUIZZICALLY TOMORROW MORNING I'LL JOIN ONE HUNDRED OTHERS IN THE GARDEN OF A PARISH CHURCH SLIGHTLY SELF CONSCIOUSLY WE'LL WAVE PALM CROSSES IN THE AIR AND SING A HYMN THEN WAS RELIEF WILL FOLLOW THE CHOIR THROUGH THE OLD OAK DOORS AND INTO CHURCH

THE WEEK AHEAD INCLUDES WORLD POETRY DAY ON MONDAY WORLD WAR TODAY ON WEDNESDAY AND EVEN ON GOOD FRIDAY INTERNATIONAL WAFFLE DAY EVERY DAY AS WORLD SOMETHING OR OTHER DAY BRANDED BY MARKETING AGENCIES TO SELL PRODUCTS OR BY CAMPAIGNERS TO BOOST GOOD CAUSES
THE FESTIVALS OF FAITH THOUGH I'M MORE JOINED UP AN INTEGRATED SUGGESTING ANOTHER ROUTE THROUGH HER LIFE AWAY TO PRACTISE FACE NOT JUST SPEAK IT THE FAMILY WE KNOW LIVING IN A BIG CITY DECIDED TO EXPERIMENT ONE LENT WITHOUT A CAR SIX WEEKS ON THEY'D ADOPTED IN A NEW MINDSET AND HAVE NEVER OWNED A CAR SINCE A JOURNALIST FRIEND IS SPENDING THIS LENT INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO GET ON WITH A COLLEAGUE SOMEONE WHO REALLY WINDS HER UP
HER LENT ISN'T A FORTY DAY DETOX BUT A PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION IT MIGHT TAKE HER AS LONG AS HER LIFE ADVENT EPIPHANY LENT EASTER CAN THIS ALTERNATIVE CALENDAR OF FAITH BE AN INTIMATION OF ANOTHER KIND OF LIVING THE WAY OF EMBEDDING NEW HABITS IN SEARCH OF A GOOD LIFE
THIS CALENDAR DOESN'T REMIND YOUR APPOINTMENTS AND DEADLINES BUT OF THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE THE WORLD YOU WANT TO LIVE IN IT'S NOT ABOUT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK OR SEVENTY YEARS OF HER LIFE BUT ABOUT EVERYONE IN ALL OF TIME IT SEASONS PAINT A BIGGER PICTURE AS BIG AS THE ONE IMAGINE BY THE LONG NOW FOUNDATION IN THE U.S. THE PEOPLE BEHIND SOMETHING CALLED A TEN THOUSAND YEAR CLOCK
THIS CLOCK WILL TICK JUST ONCE A YEAR IN PLACE OF AN HOUR HAND WILL HAVE A CENTURY HAND ITS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE IN THE LONG TERM THAT LIFE IS NOT ABOUT FASTER AND CHEAPER BUT SLOWER AND DEEPER THEIR NOTION OF THE LONG NOW RINGS TRUE IN THE ALTERNATIVE CALENDAR A FAITH WHERE PEOPLE RECITE AN ANCIENT CREED WHICH LOOKS FOR THE WORLD TO COME
HE ASKS US TO BECOME LONG SIGHTED TO PRACTISE BEING PEOPLE IT MAY TAKE A LIFETIME TO BECOME TO PLAN FOR A PRESENT WE MAY NEVER EXPERIENCE TO LONG FOR A WORLD WE MAY HAVE LEFT BEFORE IT HAS EVEN ARRIVED
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MARTIN ROWE THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT WE GOT HIM THAT'S HOW THE BELGIAN POLICE REPORTED THE CAP BRUCE THE MAN THEY SAY WAS THE RINGLEADER OF THE DEADLY ATTACKS ON PARIS FOUR MONTHS AGO HE WAS FINALLY CAUGHT AFTER A MASSIVE MANHUNT IN THE MODERN BIG AREA OF BRUSSELS THE AREA SUSPECTED OF HARBOURING SO MANY RADICAL MUSLIMS OVER THE YEARS THE MANCHESTER CITY CAPTAIN VINCENT COMPANY WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP NEAR THERE I'D LIKE MORE THAN BE THERE ARE MANY OTHER NEVER IN BRUSSELS LIKE THIS
IT'S NOT THIS IS THAT THE MEDIA MAKES IT OUT TO BE REALLY THERE'S A LOT OF TALENT AND A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAPPENING AND COMMON FROM WALLENBERG BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE'S HAD TO DEAL WITH A VERY VERY LONG TIME OF BEING IGNORED REALLY AND IT WAS VERY EASY EVEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE I GREW UP THERE JUST AS I SAID FALL OFF THE GRID WELL MICHELLE ALE ON BOSCH IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MODEL OF THE CITY COUNCIL GOOD MORNING TO YOU
MORNING WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE THERE NOW ARE PEOPLE DELIGHTED THAT HE'S BEEN CAUGHT WHAT ARE THEY SAYING HE WAS ONE OF US WERE SORRY THAT HE'S BEEN CAUGHT I HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH SOME PEOPLE NOT MUCH BUT
THEY ALL SAY DID YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A PRESSURE THAT'S GONE SINCE YESTERDAY BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A PROBLEM FOR THEM DAVID ALWAYS PROVEN HAVE THE POLICE EVERYWHERE CHECK KINGS AND CONTROL ZONE AND TOUCHING
THEY'RE HAPPY WITH WHAT HAPPENED WE HOPE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR THE COMMUNE IN GENERAL BUT HOW MUCH IF ANY IF ANY SYMPATHY WAS THERE IN MOLL BIG FOR THIS MAN
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE FORTY PERCENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND MOST OF THE
THE PERSON THAT ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE INDIES RADICALISATION IS YOUNG PEOPLE AS THEY DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO TO BE BUSY IT WAS
THEY HAVE DECIDED TO TO TO DO OTHER THINGS SOME ARE GOOD SOMETIMES BAD THAT IT'S A GANG THAT'S DRUG THAT YOU THROW THE GLAZE THERE A RADICALISATION AND GOING ABOUT MOMENT TO VIOLENCE SO
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY ALL THEY DID THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS I THINK THAT THE BIG MAJORITY HAPPY WAS IT BUT IT IS SURE THAT PROBABLY SOME OF THEM COULD FIELD HE WAS
BECAUSE HE WAS FIGHTING AGAINST THE SYSTEM TO TRYING TO DO TO GET OUT OF IT BUT NOT ON THE RIGHT WAY OF COURSE RIGHT YOU MENTION DRUGS THERE IMAGINE DRUGS PLAY A LARGE PART IN THIS THIS WHOLE RADICALISATION PROCESS
IT WAS A CONSULAR WE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WHO IS THE PERSON THAT ARE INVOLVED TOO TO FIGHT AGAINST RADICALISATION BUT NOT ONLY AND YES IT IS TRUE A DEBIT ALWAYS SEES THAT THEM DOMAIN
I THINK THAT IS MAKING THE LINK BETWEEN ALL THE KEYS THIS IS ALWAYS DRUG DRUGS
USING DEALING WHATEVER BUT DRUG IS PERMANENTLY VARIOUS BECAUSE MOST OF THE WEAPONS PROBABLY
WHAT AH WELL THAT'S THE OTHER THING OF COURSE OF ACT OUR SISTER WEAPONS BUT THEY ARE AS IT WERE WHAT DRAWN IN TO TO THIS WHOLE THING WITH THAT THERE'D BE A LOT TO YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG MEN PARTICULARLY BEING OFFERED DRUGS ARE DRAWING IN SOME STRAW IN THERE THROUGH THAT AVENUE ARE THEY
BUT ITS FUEL FOR THEM IT'S NOT THE BIG MAJORITY OF THEM BUT IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO AND YOUR INDUSTRY DID YE OLDE
OF COURSE IT WENT FROM CYGNUS IS PRESENTED TO YOU YOU ARE MORE WEAK TO REFUSE AND SO THIS IS
THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT PROBABLY THAT WE DID NOT ENOUGH TO TO HELP THEM TO TO GET OUT OF THIS AND WE HAVE PUT ALREADY HIM SUFFER PARIS THERE ARE YOU
WASTE TO THINK AND AND WE ARE WORKING ON TO FIND NEW WAYS TO HELP THEM AND TO GET OUT OF THIS YES SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING THE PROBLEM INDEED YOU YOU DON'T GET THE SENSE THAT THERE IS A GENUINE SENSE OF REAL FRUSTRATION WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND THAT THEY WILL DO ANYTHING THAT IS NEEDED TO YOU KNOW ESTABLISH A CALLOUS
NO NO I DON'T I DON'T THINK I DON'T SING THIS IT'S BUSINESS NOT THE FIGHT AGAINST IT JUST A FEW OF THEM BUT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE TOO WEAK TO TO TO TO REFUSE THE BUT
THE SCENE THAT WAS PROPOSED ANOTHER ONE MOMENT THEY JUMP ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE OF THE OPENED AT THAT'S ALL
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S AT THE GLOBE AT THE GLOBAL YOUNG PEOPLE OFF THOUGH THE COMMIT ABSOLUTELY NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT ME THIS IS A WRONG IDEA NOR RON VISION OF IT WILL THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US MICHELLE I'M A MOTH MANY THANKS

IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON AND THE LABOUR M.P. FRANK FIELD ON IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION THIS IS TODAY WITH ME JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE NINETEENTH OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE PRIME MINISTER HAS QUESTIONED IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S SUDDEN DECISION TO RESIGN LAST NIGHT HE INSISTED THERE'D BEEN A COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ON THE WELFARE CUTS WHICH THIS IS DUNCAN SMITH HAD CONDEMNED AS INDEFENSIBLE
A PLANE HAS CRASHED IN RUSSIA KILLING ALL SIXTY TWO PEOPLE ON BOARD AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS MEETING IN EMERGENCY SESSION TO DISCUSS THE ARREST OF A PRIME SUSPECT IN THE PARIS ATTACKS TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY CLOSE FROM DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID HE'S PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED BY THE SUDDEN RESIGNATION OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY
THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER DRAMATICALLY QUIT THE CABINET LAST NIGHT BY ISSUING AN EXPLOSIVE RESIGNATION STATEMENT IN WHICH HE CONDEMNED THE DECISION TO PRESS AHEAD WITH CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS AT A TIME WHEN THE WEALTHIER WERE BEING GIVEN TAX CUTS
HE ALSO QUESTIONED THE CHANCELLOR'S COMMITMENT TO THE MANTRA THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER BUT IN A LETTER TO MISTER DUNCAN SMITH MY CAMERON SAID THEY HAD BEEN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT ON THE PROPOSALS TO CHANGE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
BEFORE HE WAS OUSTED AS THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IAN DUNCAN SMITH WAS DUBBED THE QUIET MAN BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SUBDUED OR UNDERSTATED ABOUT THE MANNER OF HIS DEPARTURE LAST NIGHT INSTEAD XENIA OF A RESIGNATION LETTER DESIGNED TO INFLICT MAXIMUM DAMAGE ON THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAD LONG BEEN TESTY TESTED TO DESTRUCTION BY THIS WEEK'S BUDGET
BY QUESTIONING JUST AS THE CONSERVATIVES CRITICS HAVE LONG DONE THE TORY SLOGAN TO JUSTIFY THE CUTS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER MISTER DUNCAN SMITH KNOWINGLY PROVIDED THE GOVERNMENT'S OPPONENTS WITH AMMUNITION
HIS FRIEND AND FELLOW CAMPAIGNER FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. BERNARD JENKIN TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS NOT ALONE IN BEING IRRITATED BY GEORGE OSBORNE A LOT OF COLLEAGUES WOULD BE EXTREMELY ANNOYED AT THIS EXPLOSION
BUT THEY WILL NOT BE SURPRISED WE HAVE BEEN LED UP THE HILL AND DOWN THE HILL BY THE CHANCE OF THE EXCHEQUER I THINK THE HIGH HANDED AND SHORT TERM EST POLITICAL APPROACH THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS TENDED TO TAKE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OTHER DEPARTMENT WILL BUDGETS HAS TESTED THE PATIENTS HAVE MORE THAN ONE MINISTER
FOR A MAN WITH AMBITIONS TO LEAD HIS PARTY THESE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT DAYS FOR GEORGE OSBORNE BUT DOWNING STREET OUGHT TO POINT OUT THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAD COLLECTIVELY AGREED WITH NUMBER TEN AND THE TREASURY TO THE CHANGES TO THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT THAT PROVOKED HIS DEPARTURE I AM PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED BY YOUR RESIGNATION THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON WAKES TO A VACANCY IN HIS CABINET AND A WOUND INFLICTED ON HIS GOVERNMENT
AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAD THE TASK OF PUSHING THROUGH TWO OF THE GOVERNMENT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES THE SPARE ROOM SUBSIDY WHICH CRITICS DUBBED THE BEDROOM TAX AND THE SINGLE MONTHLY BENEFIT PAYMENT UNIVERSAL CREDIT WE'RE BOTH PART OF HIS REMIT OUR SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BUCHANAN CONSIDERS MY DUNCAN SMITH'S LEGACY AT HIS FORMER DEPARTMENT
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH CAME TO OFFICE ON A MISSION TO REFORM THE WELFARE SYSTEM THAN A TOADIE HAS TO COMPLEX AND BUREAUCRATIC BENEFITS BEIJING WAS PULLED APART SICKNESS DISABILITY HOUSING BENEFITS ALL WERE REMODELLED TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO GET A JOB WE MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S REFORMING SEWELL OFTEN CLASHED WITH TREASURY DEMANDS TO SIMPLY SAVE MONEY
MUCH OF HIS CHANGES AND THEY WERE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE WELFARE SYSTEM HOWEVER HIS MOST FUNDAMENTAL REFORM UNIVERSAL CREDIT TURNING SIX BENEFITS INTO ONE MONTHLY PAYMENT AND STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS THE CONCEPT IS WIDELY SUPPORTED BUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION LIKE SOUTHERN LOVE MISTER DUNCAN SMITH CHANGES HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS
TENS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OFF AND IT'S MUCH DELAYED HIS SUCCESSOR WILL KNOW HALF TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SYSTEMIC REFORM CAN ACTUALLY BE DELIVERED
OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG ASSESSES THE IMPACT THE RESIGNATION OF SUCH A HIGH PROFILE EURO SCEPTIC WILL HAVE ON BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE E.U. REFERENDUM
THE QUIET MAN NO MORE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS BLOWN GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET OPEN AND HIS RESIGNATION LETTER IS ANYTHING BUT QUIET
INDEED HE'S NOW VERY PUBLIC UNHAPPINESS CREATES A LIST OF PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT ALMOST AS LONG AS HIS TWO PAGE ATTACK IT UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET AND PUTS HIS SAVINGS TARGETS AT EVEN MORE RISK IT REQUIRES MINISTERIAL MOVES DE STABILISING AT A SENSITIVE TIME
AND THE DEPARTURE BREEDS EVEN MORE ANIMOSITY INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ALREADY EMBROILED IN BITTER WRANGLING OVER THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM AND FOR A PARTY ALWAYS WITH AN EYE ON ITS FUTURE IT UNDERMINED STILL FURTHER THE CHANCELLOR'S HOPES OF SMOOTHLY SUCCEEDING DAVID CAMERON AS THE TORIES NEXT LEADER
MOST DAMAGING LAY IT CAST DOUBT ON THE GOVERNMENT'S REPEATED MANTRA THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AS THEY MAKE CUTS QUESTIONING NOT JUST THE SCALE AND PACE OF AUSTERITY BUT ITS TARGETS TOO
A PLANE HAS CRASHED WHILE COMING INTO LAND AT THE SOUTHERN RUSSIAN CITY OF ROSTOV ON DON OR FIFTY FIVE PASSENGERS AND SEVEN CREW WERE KILLED THE AIRCRAFT HAD TAKEN OFF FROM DUBAI A MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG IS FOLLOWING THE STORY

THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT LOOK AGAIN AT THE BALANCE OF THE CUTS AND ASK IF ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO ENSURE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S PARTING SHOT TO DAVID CAMERON AS HE RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT LAST NIGHT FOR SIX YEARS HE'S BEEN TASKED WITH A CENTRAL PLANK OF THE CAMERON OSBORNE PLAN BRINGING DOWN THE WELFARE BILL IT MEANT CONTROVERSIAL REFORMS UNIVERSAL CREDIT AND CHANGING WHAT WAS DISABILITY LIVING ALLOWANCE INTO PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS IN THE END THE LIGHTNING ROD
HIS EXIT WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY PHILIPPA STROUD BARONESS STROUD WHO WORKED WITH IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IN THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS FOR FIVE YEARS SHE LEFT LAST AUTUMN TO BECOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE WHICH HE FOUNDED AND FROM WESTMINSTER BY FRANK FIELD LABOUR M.P. AND CHAIR OF THE WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AT THREAD YOU'VE TALKED TO MISTER DUNCAN SMITH SINCE THE RESIGNATION LAST NIGHT YES I HAVE WHAT DID HE SAY WHY NOW
I THINK IAN CAME INTO GOVERNMENT A MOVE HE DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE MANY BUT HE CAME BACK IN ORDER TO DELIVER A SOCIAL JUSTICE AGENDA OVER FORM AGENDA OF THE WELFARE STATE HE ALWAYS USED TO SAY TO ME I'M HERE IN ORDER TO DELIVER FORM AND TO PROTECT THE POOREST YESTERDAY HE FELT THAT HE COULD NO LONGER PROTECT THE POOREST
AND THEREFORE IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO STEP DOWN IT WAS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH OTHER BUDGETS IN WHICH THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT GAVE TO THE WEALTH WEALTHY AT THE SAME TIME AS BRINGING IN CULTS TO THE TO THE POOR AND A SOCIETY I THINK SO I ALWAYS JUDGEMENTS TO BE MET AT JUDGEMENT CALLS TO BE MADE IN GOVERNMENT BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME HE FELT THAT THE BALANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE WAS NOT RIGHT
THAT IT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE GIVING AWAY TAX INCENTIVES TO THE MIDDLE CLASSES ARE FREEZING FUEL DUTY AND PROTECTING UNIVERSAL BENEFITS AND PENSIONER BENEFITS AT THE TIME AT WHICH YOU'RE ALSO MAKING CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFIT BUT WHICH ABOUT AND KICKED INTO THE LONG GRASS
IT'S INTERESTING YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY HAVE THEY BEEN KICKED INTO THE LONG GRASS AND WHAT PART HAS IAN BEHIND THE SCENES BEEN PLAYING IN THIS IT WAS IAN BEHIND THE SCENES SAYING THIS IS NOT O.K. THIS IS A STEP TOO FAR THAT HAS CAUSED THEM TO BE KICKED INTO THE LONG GRASS BUT THE OTHER THING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF IS THE WAY THE TREASURY SCORE THESE SAVINGS
IS THAT ONE POINT THREE BILLION IS NOW STILL SITTING ON THE D.W.P. IS BALANCE SHEET AND UNLESS IAN WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO FAR FURTHER SAVINGS FROM PENSIONERS AND UNIVERSAL BENEFITS THEY WOULD BE COMING BACK FOR MORE FROM THE SAME BENEFITS THE EAR SAY DISABILITY BENEFITS JESS SAY ALL OF THESE FOR VULNERABLE PEOPLE LET'S TURN THEN TO THE LABOUR M.P. FRANK FIELD WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL OF THIS MISTER FIELD
WHEN I SPOKE WITH A COUPLE OF TIMES AS WE WERE VOTING LAST WEEK AND THEN THERE WERE NO SIGNS AT ALL OF A SENIOR MINISTER AT THE END OF THEIR RAG BEING BEATEN DOWN BY EVERYTHING SO I THINK WE DO HAVE TO LOOK TO THE VERY POINT THAT HAS LED US TO THAT IS THERE WERE GOING TO BE THESE VERY LARGE CUTS IN DISABILITY BENEFITS
HE WAS SENT OUT TO DEFEND THEM AND THEN THE FOLLOWING DAY WHEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF TORY BACKBENCHERS SAID THEY WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE HAPPIER OR VOTE FOR THESE CUTS UM NUMBER TEN AND NUMBER ELEVEN WERE PEDDLING OUT THE STORY WELL MAYBE WE WON'T DO IT AFTER ALL I MEAN I THINK THAT PROBABLY WAS THE SORT OF POINT WHERE YOU DECIDED TO DEPART KNOWING AS PHILIP HAS JUST SAID
THE CHANCELLOR WOULD STILL LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT WITH A BIG BILL TO PAY BUT I DO YOU THING BEHIND THIS IS A MUCH MUCH BIGGER DRAMA OF WHICH YEAR WAS THE DRIVE
IN THAT WHILE HE WITH PHILIPPA IN OPPOSITION THOUGHT OF WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO AND THAT WAS IN A SENSE BORN IN THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT NOW PHILIPPA AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT DIFFERENCES ABOUT THAT WHAT HE WAS ALSO CRUCIALLY KEPT CARED ABOUT WAS THE BALANCE OF RESOURCES GOING TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN YOUNGER PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE
AND BECAUSE HIS DEPARTMENT HAD THE LARGEST OF ALL GOVERNMENT BUDGETS THE CHANCELLOR DECIDED THAT WOULD BE MOST OF THE CARDS ABOUT SORRY CAN I JUST FINISHED I'LL SHUT UP BUT THE CRUCIAL THING WAS THAT THE PENSIONER ELEMENT OF THAT VERY LARGE BENEFIT
BUDGET THE BIGGEST PART OF THE BUDGET WAS ACTUALLY SAFEGUARDED IN FACT INCREASE AND THEREFORE ALL THESE CUTS WERE ON PEOPLE OF WORKING AGE AND I THINK IT'S AT THIS POINT THAT IAN THINKS THAT THIS SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BETWEEN GENERATIONS AND PROTECTING THE FUTURE GENERATION WAS BEING BROKEN AND THAT HAS BEEN A HALLMARK OF THIS GOVERNMENT RIGHT FROM THE START IT WAS SOMETHING THAT IAN DUNCAN FIND UP TO FOR SIX YEARS
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IAN FEELS THE PENSIONERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT PENSIONERS IS THAT PENSIONERS HAVE THE LEAST ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I THINK IT'S THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY ARE SUPPORTED AT THE SAME TIME AS CUTS OF BEING MADE TO DISABLED PEOPLE SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THIS NEEDS TO BE ABOUT BALANCE AND THIS RESIGNATION SHOULD BE VIEWED REALLY AS A CLARION CALL
TO THE GOVERNMENT OR SOCIAL JUSTICE CALL TO A LINE THEY'RE SPENDING INVESTMENT WITH THEIR SOCIAL REFORM REALITY AND IF THERE'D BEEN SOMETHING TO TO TO HIT THEIR BETTER OFF PENSIONERS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM IN THE GOVERNMENT AND TO BE HONEST IT BE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE SAVINGS AS WELL THEY'VE GOT THE TIMING OF THE FORTHCOMING E.U. REFERENDUM NOTHING AT ALL TO DO I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE I'M IN THIS COMPLETELY FREE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IAN'S BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A CONSTRAINED MAN
FRANK FIELD WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS NOW TO UNIVERSAL CREDIT THIS IS HIS FLAGSHIP REFORM IT HAD ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHERE DOES IT GO NOW WHILE IT'S CLEARLY PART OF THE LEAD UP TO OVER THE YEARS TO THIS POINT WHERE HE FEELS HE CAN NO LONGER WORK WITH HIS COLLEAGUES IN GOVERNMENT
NAMELY THAT THE IDEA WAS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY IN WORK ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT WILL BE BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE ON THE PREVIOUS HUGE ARRAY OF BENEFITS HE FAILED TO GET THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT AS PART OF THIS SO THAT ADDED ON SO TO SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE CLAIMING UNIVERSAL CREDIT AND BECAUSE THE CHANCELLOR WAS
IN A SENSE WHERE REINING BACK THE EXPENDITURE ON THIS PROGRAMME FOR THE REASONS OF TRYING TO RESTRAIN BUDGETS THE PROJECT ISN'T AS HE ORIGINALLY ENVISAGE AND THEREFORE WHILE NOBODY IS PAYING THESE ABSURD NINETY PER CENT TAX RATES
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING HIGHER TAX RATES THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY WOULD ON A MEDLEY OF BENEFITS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOW ONLY HAVE TO CAME ONE BENEFIT SO THIS THIS PUSHING HIS BUDGET CHANGING WHAT HE WANTED TO DO I'M TRYING TO DEFEND IT
I WAS THERE FROM DAY ONE AND I AGREE VERY MUCH WITH PHILIPPA'S POINT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE MYSELF WHO RID THEY WERE RELUCTANT LEVER
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WAS MORE POWERFUL AND I THOUGHT SURE IAN FELT HIMSELF MORE POWERFUL IN GOVERNMENT THAT ACTUALLY OUTSIDE COS THERE WAS NO WAY THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY BEING RESTRAINED BY COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH HAD BEEN SUSPENDED AND HE WAS ACTUALLY IX DEVELOPING THAT IN A WAY WHICH WHEN WE DID THAT LAST HAPPEN UNDER A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WITH A REFERENDUM THAT MINISTERS WERE FAR MORE RESTRAINED THAN IAN'S BEEN SO IT WASN'T THAT IS THE ISSUE I'M QUITE SURE
FRANK FIELD PHILIP ASTRIDE BARONESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE HAVE A LOT OF SPACE IN PROGRAMMES LIKE THIS TO THE STATE OF THE MILITARY FIGHTBACK AGAINST THE EXTREMISTS OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHETHER IT IRAQI FORCES FIGHTING ON THE GROUND OR THE COMBINED FORCES OF THE AMERICAN LED COALITION BUT DEFEATING THE IDEAS BEHIND TERRORISM IN THE LONG RUN HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABOUT MORE THAN THE USE OF MILITARY MIGHT A MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONNELLY HAS BEEN TRAVELLING THROUGH THE REGION
LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS TOOLS BEING BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THIS BATTLE OF IDEAS FOR THE LOT A FINAL REPORT IN HIS SERIES HE'S BEEN TO THE MOROCCAN CAPITAL RABAT WHERE A NEW CENTRE HAS OPENED FOR THE TRAINING OF IMAM FROM WEST AFRICA WHOSE JOB WILL BE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AND PREACH AGAINST VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM

CRANK SCIENCES AND HERE THE THROAT MISSION OF THE PROFITS NOT COMMON AS ONE IS AN ADVISER TO THE MOROCCAN MINISTER OF RELIGION HE SAYS HIS COUNTRY'S LEADING A COUNTER REVOLUTION AGAINST EXTREMISM TO SPREAD ITS OWN PEACEFUL VISION OF ISLAM
THROUGH THE MUSLIM WORLD WE HAVE TO SPREAD THIS KIND OFF TEACHING EVERYWHERE BECAUSE ISLAM IS BASED ON THE WAY THAT YOU CAN WORSHIP GOD BUT SMOOTHLY AND SOFTLY
THE FANATICS OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE RUN A SLICK AND GRIMLY EFFECTIVE INTERNET OPERATION DISSEMINATING THEIR DARK AND DANGEROUS IMAGES OF BOMBINGS AND BEHEADINGS DO YOUNG MUSLIMS IN COUNTRIES WHICH DENY THEM HOPE

FOR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY QUIT LAST NIGHT SAYING THAT THE CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS WERE INDEFENSIBLE AT A TIME WHEN THE RICH WERE BEING GIVEN TAX CUTS LADY STRIDE WHO WORKED WITH MISTER DUNCAN SMITH AND GOVERNMENT TOLD US THAT HE WANTED TO DELIVER SOCIAL JUSTICE AND DECIDED TO LEAVE WHEN HE COULD NO LONGER PROTECT THE POOREST IN SOCIETY
ALL SIXTY TWO PEOPLE ON BOARD A PASSENGER PLANE HAVE DIED IN A CRASH AND SOUTHERN RUSSIA THE FLY DUBAI FLIGHT BURST INTO FLAMES WHILE TRYING TO LAND AT ROSTOV ON DON AIRPORT IT'S BELIEVED BAD WEATHER MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRASH
THE PARIS ATTACK SUSPECTS A LA ABDUS SALAM HAS BEEN DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER BEING TREATED FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS AFTER SALAAM WAS SHOT IN THE LEG BY POLICE YESTERDAY BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED IN BRUSSELS THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT EXPECTS HIM TO BE EXTRADITED TO FRANCE WITHIN DAYS
A NEW VIDEO HAS APPEARED ONLINE APPARENTLY SHOWING A BRITISH PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE BY THE ISLAMIC STATE COULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY TWELVE IS THE FIRST FOOTAGE OF JOHN CURRENTLY TO EMERGE IN A YEAR TWENTY FIVE TO NINE AS IF MISTER CAMERON DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE REACTIONS TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH LAST NIGHT THAT HE IS RESIGNING AS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY HIS JOB
MAY HAVE NOT PUT HIM OFFICIALLY IN THE TOP RANK OF THE CABINET BUT IT WAS DOING WAS CRUCIAL TO ONE OF MISTER CAMERON'S BIG AMBITIONS TO BRING SPENDING ON THE WELFARE STATE UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT SETTING OFF THE NATION AT HIS THROAT AND MISTER CAMERON HAD CLEARLY NOT BEEN EXPECTING THE RESIGNATION WILL I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON AND ON THE LINE BY OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BUT THE POLISH ISN'T IT FIRST LAURA
GOOD MORNING JOHN WHY NOT SHARE IT'S VERY HEALTHY FOR ANYBODY LET ALONE A POLITICAL PARTY TO HAVE SO MUCH AS DEEPLY HELD ANGER FLYING AROUND ON A SATURDAY MORNING NO SENIOR MINISTERS ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW HE WAS ONLY IN IT FOR THE SOCIAL REFORM THAT HE WASN'T PART OF THE ATTEMPT TO SAVE MONEY FROM THE WELFARE BUDGET I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS MORNING BY SOME PEOPLE THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN OUTRAGEOUS
FOR HIS PAROLE POINT OF VIEW ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO HIM HE IS ALSO ABSOLUTELY FURIOUS CHEERING THAT DRIPS FROM EVERY LINE OF THAT EXPLOSIVE RESIGNATION LETTER I THINK IT REALLY CREATES A LIST OF PROBLEMS ALMOST AS LONG AS THAT TWO PAGES A VENOM ITSELF YOU KNOW IT MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE HAVE TO BE MINISTERIAL MOVES IN TEAMS AND A VERY SENSITIVE TIME IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST BIT BECAUSE THIS UNDERMINES ALSO NOT JUST THESE PARTICULAR REFORMS TO DISABILITY PAYMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN JUNKED
BUT OF COURSE GEORGE OSBORNE SUMS IN THEIR WHOLE BUDGET THIRDLY I THINK MAYBE MOST POINTEDLY OF ALL MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S LETTER BASICALLY QUESTIONS HOW THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN GOING ABOUT ITS BALANCE IT'S ITS MAIN MISSION TRYING TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND HE SUGGESTS THE GOVERNMENT'S MANTRA WE'VE ALL HEARD SO MANY TIMES FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER IT'S JUST NOT TRUE IT ALSO CREATES
EVEN MORE ANIMOSITY IN THE TORY PARTY DURING THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND OF COURSE IT UNDERMINES GEORGE OSBORNE'S CHANCES OF TAKING OVER THE TORY LEADERSHIP TO SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT LAURA THANK YOU FOR THAT MICHAEL FELON ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE WHO IS FURIOUS THIS MORNING NO LAST NIGHT NO I'M DISAPPOINTED IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S BEEN A BIG PART OF OUR REFORMS SINCE HE TOOK ON THE JOB SIX YEARS AGO
TWO MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN WORK THERE ARE MANY FEWER SOME SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN WORKLESS HOUSEHOLDS AND WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS A SIMPLER FUR A BENEFITS SYSTEM HE'S BEEN A BIG PART OF THAT THAT WELFARE REFORM PROGRAMME WILL GO ON AND I'LL BE A NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY APPOINTED LATER TODAY IN THE PROGRAMME WILL CONTINUE WHAT IF IT'S ALSO HUNKY DORY WHY WOULD HE HAVE GONE
WELL HE'S GONE NOW I THINK BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS ISSUE HAS UNFOLDED THESE REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE GIVING AWAY ON THERE YES THAT'S THE SLIGHT PUZZLE ABOUT ALL THIS THE DECISION WAS TAKEN YESTERDAY THAT MORE TIME WAS NEEDED TO GET THESE PROPOSALS WHICH CAME FROM HIS DEPARTMENT TO GET THEM INTO BETTER SHAPE SO IT IS A BIT OF A PUZZLE AS TO WHY HE'S CHOSEN TO GO NOW BUT YOU MUST ASK HE WAS ASK HIM THAT WELL WE WE HOPE TO BEFORE VERY MUCH LONGER OBVIOUSLY
HE'S MAKING A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT A POWERFUL POINT ISN'T HE THAT RESIGNATION LETTER WAS A VERY VERY STRONG LETTER INDEED BY ANY STANDARDS WAS IT WHEN HE SAYS HE'D RELUCTANTLY COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE LATEST CHANGES TO BENEFITS FOR THE DISABLED THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY'D BEEN MADE A COMPROMISE TOO FAR THEY MAY BE DEFENSIBLE IN NARROW TURN WAS GIVEN THE CONTINUING DEFICIT
THEY ARE NOT DEFENSIBLE IN THE WAY THEY WERE PLACED WITHIN A BUDGET THAT BENEFITS HIGHER BURNING TAXPAYERS THAT'S PRETTY DEVASTATING STUFF ISN'T IT WELL LET ME MAKE TWO POINTS ABOUT THAT FIRST THE EXPENDITURE ON THE DISABLED AND SICKNESS BENEFIT HAS BEEN GOING UP IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE BUDGET UNDER CONTROL THAT HAS LED TO SOME OF THESE REFORMS WERE SPENDING FIFTY BILLION A YEAR ON IT MUCH MORE THAN LABOUR THE SPENDING ON THE DISC THE DISABLED
AND WERE SPENDING MORE ON IT FOR EXAMPLE AND WE ARE ON MY DEFENCE BUDGET IF I DID THAT IN AGAINST THIRTY FIVE BID NOW ON YOUR CENTRAL POINT ABOUT FAIRNESS IS CENTRAL HIS CENTRAL POINT FITNESS I'M SORRY LET ME JUST SET THE POSITION I HAD EVERYBODY IN TWO WEEKS' TIME EVERYBODY'S A TAX FREE ALLOWANCE GOES UP TO ELEVEN THOUSAND TO GET UP AGAIN
NEXT APRIL TO ELEVEN AND A HALF THOUSAND EVERY PENSIONER IS GETTING THE BIGGEST EVER REAL TERMS INCREASE IN THEIR PENSION TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN POUNDS A WEEK IN TWO WEEKS' TIME EVERYBODY UNDER FORTY IS ENTITLED TO THEIR NEW LIFETIME SAVINGS ALLOWANCE EVERYBODY ON LOW WAGES GETS THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WEIGHTS AT THESE ARE POLICIES THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT EVERYBODY NOT JUST THE FEW BUT WHAT HE IS SAYING IS THAT THIS WAS POLITICAL THE BUDGET WAS
POLITICAL DISTINCTLY POLITICAL TO USE HIS EXACT WORDS RATHER THAN IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST AND WHAT THE POINT IS MAKING AND PEOPLE CAN GET THIS CAN'T THEY MMH IT'S VERY SIMPLE POINT YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM POOR DISABLED PEOPLE
AND USING IT TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE MIDDLE CLASS PUT VERY SIMPLY WE WEREN'T GOING TO TAKE MORE MONEY MONEY AWAY FROM POOR AND DISABLED PEOPLE IT MEANT WE WOULD HAVE LOST MONEY NO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU CAN SUPPOSE TONY'S AN EXPERT WELL THE PROJECT FURTHER
ON DISABILITY BENEFITS THE BUDGET HAS BEEN INCREASING THE SPENDER'S BEEN GOING UP EVERY YEAR AND THIS IS AND THIS WAS AT THESE WERE A SET OF PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE SPENDING MOST OF IT ON THOSE WHO REALLY NEEDED IT MOST NOW OF COURSE WE'VE NOW DECIDED THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO GET THOSE PARTICULAR PROPOSALS INTO BALANCE BUT OVERALL THE CHANCELLOR AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO TAKE US TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT OF WHETHER WE
STOP THE INCREASE IN FUEL DUTY FOR EVERYBODY WHETHER WE INCREASE EVERYBODY'S TAX FREE ALLOWANCE OR WHETHER WE MAKE CHANGES IN THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS NOW THE ENTIRE CABINET ENDORSE THE BUDGET INCLUDING END UP AND SMITH ON WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE IT WAS PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT THE CABINET WILL BE VOTING AND AS WITH THE REST OF THE WHOLE OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BUDGET ON TUESDAY AND WE WON'T GO ON WITH THIS WITH A POLICY OF MODERNISING THE WELFARE SYSTEM
BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE BENEFITS AS THE ECONOMY GROWS PERHAPS THE MOST DEVASTATING PART OF THE LETTER WAS HIS USE OF THE WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER BOTH BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN DAVID CAMERON'S PROUDEST CLAIM HASN'T IT AND IT HE HANDED TO PERSUADE THE NATION OF THAT I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT
ALL PRIME MINISTERS IN A SENSE HAVE TO PERSUADE THE NATION OF THAT WHAT BEING DUNCAN SMITH YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT WELL I DON'T ACCEPT THAT I'VE EXPLAINED ALREADY HOW EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THESE TAX CHANGES IN TWO WEEKS' TIME EVERY PENSIONER IS PROTECTED AND THERE WERE MEASURES IN THE BUDGET DON'T FORGET TO INCREASE THE TAX TO MAKE PROPERTY DEVELOPERS FOR EXAMPLE PAY MORE TAX TO STOP PEOPLE AVOIDING INCOME TAX BY SELLING THEMSELVES UP
PERSONAL SERVICE COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE WERE PLENTY OF MEASURES TO MAKE THE TAXATION SYSTEM FAIRER JUST AS WE HAVE PROPOSALS TO MAKE THE BENEFIT SYSTEM FAIRER ONE HAS TO WONDER WHETHER THIS IS IN PART WELL THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES ONE OF THEM IS THAT HE DID NOT GET ON WITH GEORGE OSBORNE MISTER OSBORNE APPARENTLY THOUGHT HE NOT HE WASN'T INTELLIGENT HE WAS TOO THICK FOR JOHN
WELL I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THEY'VE WORKED AT WHAT YOU HEARD IF HE COULD'VE BEEN IN MANY MANY MANY WHICH I READ OVER THE YEARS BUT THEY HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER FOR SIX YEARS ON THE VERY DIFFERENT IT WAS MAYBE OF GETTING GETTING THE WELFARE BUDGET PROPERLY BALANCED HELP GETTING HELP TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST MAKING SURE THE COST OF THE WELFARE BUDGET DON'T SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL THEY WORK SIDE BY SIDE AS THE PUBLIC FINANCES ARE BEING RESTORED THEY'VE BEEN GOOD COLLEAGUES AND THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WE SHOULD REMEMBER HAS BEEN PART OF HELPING MORE PEOPLE INTO WORK AND MOVING TOWARDS A SIMPLER AND A BENEFITS SYSTEM AND HE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THAT IN A SENTENCE IT HAS MADE MY CAMERON'S LIFE MORE DIFFICULT HASN'T IT WELL IT'S DISAPPOINTING BUT AS I SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME GOES ON THE WELFARE REFORM PROGRAMME WILL GO ON THERE WILL BE A NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY ANNOUNCED LATER TODAY WE WILL ALL BE IN THE LOBBY TOGETHER VOTING FOR THE BUDGET ON TUESDAY MICHAEL FALLON MANY THANKS
THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS LOTS OF COVERAGE AS YOU'D EXPECT OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION THE GUARDED CALLED AT THE MOST DRAMATIC CABINET DEPARTURE OF DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP ASSIGNED IT DIVISIONS OVER EUROPE HAVE HEIGHTENED TENSIONS IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE SUN COLUMNIST TREVOR CABINET PREDICTS THAT HE WON'T BE THE LAST MINISTER TO QUIT THE CABINET AS OTHERS ARE STRUGGLING TO SQUARE LOYALTY TO DAVID CAMERON WITH THEIR AMBITION TO SEE BRITAIN
OUT OF THE E.U. THE TELEGRAPH SAYS DAVID CAMERON WILL POSTPONE PUBLICATION OF THE IRAQ WAR INQUIRY UNTIL THE REPORT THAT IS UNTIL AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN JUNE AND THAT HAS LED TO ACCUSATIONS THAT HE IS DELIBERATELY DELAYING CONTROVERSIAL ANNOUNCEMENT IT SAYS SIR JOHN CHILCOTT REPORT IS DUE TO BE HANDED TO MINISTERS NEXT MONTH
AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT IT COULD BE SECURITY VETTED FOR RELEASE WITHIN TWO WEEKS TOG I QUOTE ANOTHER TENSE OR SAYING SIR JOHN HE SUGGESTED A JUNE OR JULY TIMETABLE FOR PUBLICATION LAST AUTUMN BUT NO DATE
COULD BE SPECIFIED UNTIL THE REPORT HAD BEEN SEEN AND THE SUN AMONG OTHERS REPORTS MISTER CAMERON WILL SPEND EASTER IN LANZAROTE AT ACCUSES HIM OF IGNORING HIS OWN PLEA FOR BRITISH FAMILIES TO TAKE THEIR HOLIDAYS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND TO HELP IT RECOVER FROM SEVERE WINTER FLOODS THE HEADLINE CALLS IN THE LANDS A ROTTER DOWNING STREET ISN'T COMMENTING ON THE TRIP BUT A GOVERNMENT SOURCE IS QUOTED IN THE SUN SAYING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER REGULARLY GOES ON HOLIDAY IN ENGLAND AS WELL AS ABROAD AND THE TWO THINGS ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE THE DINERS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE
THE MAIN SUSPECT FROM THE PARIS ATTACKS UP TO SALAAM EVADED CAPTURE FOR FOUR MONTHS BEFORE HE WAS ARRESTED LAST NIGHT IN THE BRUSSELS SUBURB OF MOLYN BACK THE VERY AREA WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY TARGETED BY BELGIAN ANTI TERROR POLICE WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON KERRERA AND HERE IN THE STUDIO BY CHRIS PHILLIPS FORMER HEAD OF THE NATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM SECURITY OFFICE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GORDON HOW MUCH BAKU IS IT THAT HE WAS CAPTURED ALIVE
WE GOT HIM WAS THE COMMENT FROM BELGIAN OFFICIALS AND THEY WERE CLEARLY JUBILANT AT THE FACT THAT THEY'D MANAGED TO FIND HIM AFTER FOUR MONTHS AND CATCH HIM ALIVE CERTAINLY THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT IF HE'S WILLING TO TALK THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS STILL UNANSWERED ABOUT THE PLANNING OF THE PARIS ATTACKS ABOUT THE LOGISTICS AND HOW WEAPONS AND MONEY WERE SENT IN ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS MOVED ABOUT THE SUPPORT NETWORK ABOUT WHO PROTECTED SALAH AD
AFTERWARDS HE MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THOSE IF HE'S WILLING TO TALK AND THAT'S WHY THE FRENCH WANT TO GET HOLD OF HIM SO FAST FRANCOIS LON SAID YOU WANTED HIM EXTRADITED SOON SO I THINK CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT GOOD TO HAVE GOT HIM ALIVE BUT ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT AS YOU SAID WHITE TOOK SO LONG AND CHRIS PHILLIPS HE DID END UP BEING ARRESTED IN THE VERY PLACE THAT IT BUT THEY'D HAVE BEEN A REPEATED FOCUS ANTI TERROR RAIDS AND ALL SORTS OF SUSPICIONS ABOUT ABOUT THIS AREA WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES
ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT HE WAS ON THE RUN FOR FOUR MONTHS AND CAPTURED THEIR WALLETS IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OVER IN BELGIUM BECAUSE IT REALLY THEY REALLY KNEW OR HAD A VERY GOOD IDEA WHERE THIS GUY WAS HE WAS LITERALLY TWO STREETS AWAY FROM WHERE HE LIVED PREVIOUSLY SO
IT DOES SHOW A PAUCITY OF OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN WITHIN BRUSSELS WITHIN THIS AREA WHICH IS KNOWN FOR TERRORISM AND I THINK THEY'LL BE WHAT'D BE JUBILANT THAT THEY'VE CAUGHT HIM THEY'LL ALSO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY THEY COULDN'T FIND HIM IN FOUR MONTHS FOR GOODNESS' SAKE YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD HOPE TO TO BE ABLE TO COVER THE CITY OF THE WHOLE OF LONDON IN THAT TIME AND AND WE HAD TERRORIST AND IN LONDON THE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE COME FORWARD VERY QUICKLY HAD TO REPORT TO YOU DO YOU THINK THE SITUATION IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN THIS COUNTRY
I CERTAINLY THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND TALK TO THE POLICE WE'VE HAD THAT IN THE PAST I THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT THE DIFFICULTIES THE BELGIANS HAVE GOT AND PROBABLY THE LACK OF LACK OF INTEL THAT THEY'RE GETTING FROM WITHIN THAT WITHIN THAT CITY WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO YOU THINK ARE OUR ABILITY IN THIS COUNTRY TOO WELL ESSENTIALLY HAVING
INFORMANTS OR INFORMATION COMING FROM THAT COMMUNITY'S BETTER ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IT'S SHOWN BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SHOW AND REPORT PEOPLE BECOMING RADICALISED THAT'S INCREASING IN THE U.K. I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT A PROBLEM I THINK BUT I THINK CERTAINLY IN BRUSSELS IT'S UP IT'S A PARTICULAR PROBLEM
GORDON OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW I MEAN PRESUMABLY WILL BE EXTRADITED TO FRANCE AND THEY WERE LEAD THIS YES THAT'S RIGHT THEY'VE MAKE CLEAR THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS THEY WANT TO ASK HIM IT WAS INTERESTING FRANCOIS LONG'S LAST NIGHT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A MUCH WIDER NETWORK AROUND THE PARIS ATTACKS THAN THEY'D FIRST THOUGHT IN THE AFTERMATH IT SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THERE WERE MANY MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND EVEN SOME OF THE
THE LEEDS WHICH LED TO YESTERDAY'S CAPTURE LOOK LIKE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT SUPPORT NETWORK AND SO CLEARLY THE FEAR IS THAT THERE IS A MUCH LARGER SUPPORT NETWORK SOME MAYBE SYMPATHISERS SOME MAY BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND OF COURSE THE FEAR IS SOME OF THOSE MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN PLANNING FUTURE ATTACKS AND SO THAT THE ABILITY TO TRACE ALL OF THOSE LEADS TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MOVEMENTS AND LOGISTICS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR
BRUSSELS HAS BEEN ON HIGH ALERT A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND THE FRENCH ARE STILL VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE SECURITY SITUATION CHRIS WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER NETWORK I THINK TIME WILL TELL BUT I THINK THERE'S IT'S A BIG CONCERN THAT WE'VE GOT PEOPLE ABLE TO TO GO AROUND THE CITIES OF BRUSSELS AND PARIS WITH THESE AND COMMIT OFFENCES I THINK I THINK WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET IS ACTUALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE RETURNED FROM IRAQ AND SYRIA IN ORDER TO COMMIT
CHRIS PHILLIPS AND GORDON THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS HAVE REACHED TO DEAL WITH TURKEY TO TRY TO TACKLE THE GREAT MIGRATION CRISIS UNDER THE AGREEMENT FROM MIDNIGHT ON SUNDAY MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN GREECE WILL BE SENT BACK TO TURKEY IF THEIR ASYLUM CLAIM IS REJECTED IN RETURN E.U. COUNTRIES WERE RESETTLED THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS DIRECTLY FROM TURKEY AND TURKEY WILL GET FINANCIAL AID AND FAST
EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP TALKS OR DANIEL BIRCHES A CORRESPONDENT IN IZMIR IN TURKEY DOES THIS MEAN DANIEL THAT TURKEY'S GOT EVERYTHING IT WANTED
SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN AGREED IS PERHAPS LESS THAN HAD INITIALLY BEEN PUT ON THE TABLE BUT THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS TURKEY HAS FELT VERY MUCH THAT IT HAS DONE MORE THAN ITS FAIR SHARE IT ALREADY HAD TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION SYRIAN REFUGEES
WITHIN ITS BORDERS AND YESTERDAY TURKEYS PRESIDENT SAID THAT EUROPE REALLY NEEDED TO SORT OUT ITS OWN POLICY
ON MIGRANTS BEFORE IT STARTED TELLING TURKEY WHAT TO DO NOW AS TO WHETHER THIS DEAL WILL WORK EVEN THOUGH THERE IS THIS MIDNIGHT DEADLINE AFTER WHICH THE RULES WILL CHANGE IT WILL STILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE PEOPLE WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO TURKEY THEY NEED TO SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THAT WORK THAT IT WOULD TAKE UP TO FOUR THOUSAND STAFF JUDGES INTERPRETERS BORDER GUARDS
FOR ALL OF THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THIS IS TO DISRUPT THAT FLOW OF MIGRANTS FROM TURKEY TO THE GREEK ISLANDS AND IF YOU GO TO SOME OF THOSE CROSSING POINTS WHERE THERE'S JUST A FEW MILES OF WATER BETWEEN THE TWO COASTS YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE
TAKE THAT RISK AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE WORK OF PEOPLE TRAFFICKERS COVE STREWN WITH BOXES FROM OUTBOARD ENGINES PACKAGING'S PERFECT FOR A TYRE INNER TUBES THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO MIGRANTS INSTEAD OF LIFEJACKETS DISCARDED CLOTHING ALL OF THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF MIGRANTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT IS NO LONGER WORTH TAKING
THAT RISK AND OVER THE PAST THEY WERE SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT COASTGUARDS HAVE STOPPED MORE AND MORE PEOPLE CROSSING SEVENTEEN HUNDRED OR SO YESTERDAY IN ONE DISTRICT NOW WHETHER THAT IS BECAUSE COASTGUARDS ARE CARRYING OUT MORE PATROLS OR WHETHER PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO RUSH TO BEAT THIS DEADLINE ISN'T CLEAR AT THEM AND JUST A QUICK THOUGHT IF YOU WOULD MANY PEOPLE ARE WORRIED
THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF THIS DEAL IS THERE WILL BE MANY MILLIONS OF TURKS IN EUROPE WHO WILL IN THE END BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS COUNTRY AS WELL
THAT IS PART OF THE DEAL THAT TURKEY WANTED THAT THERE IS THIS VISA FREE ACCESS TO THE SHERINGHAM AREAS OF THE AT THE MOMENT OF THE SEVENTY TWO CONDITIONS OR SO THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THAT ONLY A HALF OF THOSE
BEING MET THERE ALSO OTHER LONG TERM QUESTIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A CAT BOTH AROUND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND ON THIS SCHEME AFTER WHICH IT WOULD NO LONGER BE AN OPERATION THERE ARE SO MANY SYRIAN REFUGEES IN TURKEY IS THAT GOING TO MAKE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THAT BY TRYING TO SHOT OFF THIS ONE PARTICULAR ROUTE IT MAY PUSH PEOPLE TO OTHERS POTENTIALLY MORE DANGEROUS LONGER SEA CROSSINGS DANIEL MANY THANKS
THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO NINE POPE FRANCIS IS MARKING THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ELECTION TODAY BY JOINING INSTAGRAM THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPHS ARE EXPECTED AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE PLATFORM HAS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF USERS FAMOUS FOR THE LEB CELEBRITIES POSTING PICTURES OF THEMSELVES AND NOW IT IS INCREASING BEING USED BY PUBLIC FIGURES INCLUDING POLITICIANS
WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR MARIANNE HARDY FROM DURHAM UNIVERSITY WHO SPECIALISES IN MARKETING AT THE UNIVERSITY BUSINESS SCHOOL SHE'S IN A YORK STUDIO AND IN THE STUDIO HERE BY MIKE WE'RE GOING A JOURNALIST WOULD BE B. C. TRENDING GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING AND MIKE WENT IN WE GENERALLY PROBABLY THINK OF INSTAGRAM AT LEAST MOST OF US DO IS THE PRESERVE OF PEOPLE LIKE BEYONCE HOW MUCH IS IT CHANGING YEAH THAT'S RIGHT IT IS CHANGING AND POLITICIANS ARE CUT ME NINE I HAVE TO SAY THAT MOSTLY IT'S AMERICAN POLITICIANS
BRITISH POLITICIANS HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE IT YET TO BE QUITE BLUNT ABOUT IT AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S ON IT THOUGH ISN'T HE HE LAUNCHED HIS ACCOUNT ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO DOESN'T HAVE THAT MANY FOLLOWERS FEWER THAN TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE AND THE KINDS OF PHOTOS THAT HE'S
POSTING I HONESTLY THEY SHOW THAT HE HASN'T QUITE GOT THE HANG OF IT YET WHY WHAT ARE THEY LIKE THEY'RE QUITE PHOTO HAPPY THERE ARE YOU NO JUST HIM TALKING IN FRONT OF CROWDS IF YOU LOOK AT SAY PRESIDENT OBAMA HE POST PICTURES OF HIS FAMILY HE POST PICTURES
JOKES OF THINGS BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE WHITE HOUSE YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THAT I'M DAVID CAMERON IF YOU TAKING SELFIES AND PUTTING IT BUT PUTTING THEM ON I BELIEVE IT DOES HAVE SELFIES BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST SELFIES IT'S IT'S IT GIVES HER A SORT OF A FLAVOUR OF LIFE INSIDE THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE YOU DON'T GET
A FLAVOUR OF LIFE INSIDE NUMBER TEN FROM DAVID CAMERON'S INSTAGRAM FEET AND DOCTOR MARIANNE HARDY IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT WELL DO YOU HAVE TO USE IT DIFFERENTLY OR SEE IT DIFFERENTLY FROM FROM WHERE YOU WOULD PUT ALBUM WHERE YOU PUT OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS OTHERWISE I THINK YOU DO AND ACTUALLY JOHN'S POINT ABOUT SOPHIE'S IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN TERMS OF THE IMAGE OF THE SELF SURGERY WHAT'S COMPELLING ABOUT THIS IS WE GO FROM THE IMAGE OF HERSELF SELF TO THE IMAGE OF TAKING THE IMAGE OF HERSELF
THAT'S WHAT'S COMPELLING THAT'S WHAT'S PERSONAL ABOUT IT THAT'S WHAT'S SO ALMOST ADDICTIVE IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE OF THE CULTURE THAT WE CREATE AN ADDICTIVE IS HE'S WELL IMPORTANT BECAUSE WELL THIS IS THE PLATFORM THAT'S BLAMED FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING THE SELFIE CULTURE ENCOURAGING NARCISSISM
VERY MUCH SO AND AROUND THE SELFIE CULTURE IS ALSO THE EXTENSION OF THE SELF BUT DIFFERENT METHODS OF OF MAKING MONEY SO SPONSORED POST BRANDS ARE USING INSTAGRAM VERY WELL BUT ALSO INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PAID TO IF YOU'VE GOT ABOVE TEN K. FOLLOWERS FIFTY K. FOLLOWERS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLLOWERS MORE GETTING PAID TO ENDORSE PRODUCTS THEY SAY HAVE YOU DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE YOU ADVISE THAT THIS IS INSTAGRAM IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE FOR MARKETING IS IT
IN TERMS OF MARKETING YES IT IS AND THEN WE CAN SEE HOW THERE'S AN EXTENSION OF MULTI CHANNEL MARKETING METHODS DEBATE AROUND THE SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL MEDIA AND KINDS OF THE EVER CHANGING DYNAMICS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AROUND THAT AND IT'S WERE QUOTES THE AUDREY CONSUMER CAN KIND OF ENGAGE IN FORMS A VISUAL PRESENTATION LET'S SEE HOW THE POPE USERS THAT FROM ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING
MARION HARDY AND MIKE WENT THANK YOU BOTH FIVE NINE WHEN IAN DUNCAN SMITH WAS THE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HE FAMOUSLY DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS THE QUIET MAN WELL NOW OH CLICHE COMING UP THE QUIET MAN HAS MADE A LOT OF NOISY HAS RESIGNED FROM THE CABINET JUST THE TIME WHEN DAVID CAMERON IS ALREADY SERIOUSLY BELEAGUERED SO HOW MUCH DAMAGE SHE'S GOING TO DO I'M JOINED BY MATTHEW DOWN CORNER OF THE GUARDIAN AND ISABEL OAK SHOP OF THE DAILY MAIL WHAT'S THE LATEST TO ISABELLE
WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOMENT THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH DECIDED TO RESIGN WAS AROUND SEVEN OR EIGHT O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT WHEN A STORY DROPPED ON THE PRESS ASSOCIATION WIRES WHICH ESSENTIALLY DISTANCE THAT THE TREASURY FROM THESE REFORMS VERY VERY CONTROVERSIAL REFORMS TO DISABILITY BENEFIT I'M PRETTY MUCH
SUGGESTED THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE THING AND THAT WAS IT FOR HIM HE DECIDED HE'S HAD ENOUGH REALLY THAT SWIFT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN BREWING FOR HER YOU COULD SAY ACTUALLY FOR YEARS BUT IN TERMS OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IT'S BEEN BREWING FOR A FEW DAYS I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHILE HE HAD ESSENTIALLY SIGNED UP TO THESE CHANGES HE WANTED TO HANDLE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND HE WANTED TO HANDLE IT
DELICATELY AND SENSITIVELY AND IN FACT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TREASURY REFUSED TO LET HIM HANDLE IT THEY BRIEFED US OUT TO THE PAPERS LAST WEEKEND AND THEY MADE THIS TOXIC CONNECTION BETWEEN TAX CUTS FOR THE BETTER OFF AND THESE DISABILITY BENEFIT CARS AND THAT WAS CLEARLY EXTREMELY DIVISIVE SO MATTHEW THE DAMAGE WELL BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE DAMAGE TO MISTER CAMERON
WHAT ABOUT THE REASONS WHAT DID HE WANT INDIGO LET'S PUT IT BLUNTLY NO BUT I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AS ISOBEL SUGGESTED IS THAT
THIS IS A TURF WAR THAT'S JUST AS THEY'D IMPORTANT AS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE IT'S GOES BACK ALL THE WAY TO OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND TEND WHEN DUNCAN SMITH WAS FURIOUS THAT OSBORNE ANNOUNCED THE CUTS FOR A HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS TO CHILD BENEFIT WITHOUT TELLING HIM AND DUNCAN SMITH HAS NEVER BEEN QUITE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE FACT
THAT THE WORKING PENSION SECRETARIES JUNIOR IN THE CABINET TO THE CHANCELLOR HAVING BEEN A FORMALLY IT IS A DIFFICULT THING FOR HIM TO STAND AND HE AND OSBORNE HAVE CLASHED DAWNS FOR THE FULL SIX YEARS THAT THEY'VE BEATEN CABINET TOGETHER AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO GET A LONG AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT DUNCAN SMITH HAS SIGNED UP REPEATEDLY
TO THE FISCAL POLICY OF WHICH THIS BUDGET WAS APART AND HE OBJECTS VERY CAREFULLY IN HIS LETTER TO THE PRESENTATIONAL ISSUES RATHER THAN CONTENT LET'S GO MUCH FURTHER THAN THIS THING ABOUT WE ARE NOT
ALL IN IT TOGETHER YES LONG GRAY THAT WAS PRETTY DAMNING IT WELL HE WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT IT WAS IT WAS ILL ADVISED TO ANNOUNCE TO CHANGE IN THE CONTEXT OF A BUDGET THAT CONTAINED MEASURES HELPFUL TO THE THE BETTER OFF BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE THINGS THAT THAT OSBORNE HAS DONE THAT IT WILL HELP THE LESS BETTER OFF NOT TO MENTION NATIONAL WAGE ET-CETERA ET-CETERA
SO I FEEL THAT THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF A LONG PERSONAL BATTLE BETWEEN TWO POLITICIANS THE PEAK OVER THE CLEAR TOTAL BEDLAM OF THE LAST FEW DAYS OF BRIEF ENCOUNTER BRIEFING AND THE INEVITABLE TENSIONS ARE BRECK SET HAS BROUGHT RIGHT AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE SECOND WE'VE GOT TRY AND ISABELLE
WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE IS COME AND GOING TO BE GLAD TO BE SHOT OF HIM IN THE LONG RUN WELL I DON'T THINK SO IMPOSSIBLY IN THE LONG RUN BUT HE WILL HE BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A LONGER I THINK THAT THIS IS INCREDIBLY DESTABILISING IT WAS WHAT IS A SUPREMELY SENSITIVE TIME IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM IT IS THE LAST THING THAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD WANT NOW WE'RE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT INSTAGRAM IF THERE WAS AN INSTAGRAM PICTURE OF CAMERON BEHIND THE SCENES THIS MORNING HE WOULD HAVE HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND MATTHEW DID SEEM GENUINELY SURPRISED
WELL RIGHTLY SO BECAUSE DOUGLAS SMITH HAD SIGNED UP TO A STRATTON I THINK THAT THAT HE WAS I THINK TINKER DUNCAN SMITH WAS GOING TO GO AT SOME POINT DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE HAD HE HAD ATTACKED
CAMERON STEWARDSHIP OF THE E.U. NEGOTIATIONS IN TERMS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT VERY HARD FOR HIM TO RETURN TO GOVERNMENT SO AT SOME POINT BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THE DAY OF THE REFERENDUM I THINK HE WAS GOING TO GO AND THESE RECORD OF THE REFERENDUM VERY LITTLE I THINK THE THE ONLY COS IT WAS ALREADY SAID YES EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE REMAIN CAMP
DON'T LEAVE THE THAT THAT OUT CAMP ENDLESSLY HAVING THE INITIATIVE BORIS GETTING THE THEATRICALITY OF ANNOUNCING HE'S GOING OUT DUNCAN SMITH RESIGNING THE ENERGY IS ON THE ON THE MAKE OF THE WAVES AS A FINAL TWENTY SECONDS
I THINK THIS UNDERMINES DAVID CAMERON'S AUTHORITY AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY AN UNHELPFUL THING FOR THE REMAIN CAUSE AND I THINK ALSO IT'S SLIGHTLY ENHANCES IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S STATUS IN THE POPULAR MIND YOU KNOW THERE IS FOR SOME COHORT OF PEOPLE THE IDEA THAT HE IS NOW A BIT OF A MARTYR ISABELLE SHORTAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL MATTHEW DON'T CO OWNER OF THE GUARDIAN AND EVENING STANDARD THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL FROM US OUR EDITORS WERE TOM FIELDEN AND HARRIET NOBLE NEXT ON RADIO FOUR SATURDAY LIVE FROM ALL OF US GOOD MORNING
