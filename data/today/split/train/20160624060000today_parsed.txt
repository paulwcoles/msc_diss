IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE B. B. C. IS FORECASTING THAT THE U.K. HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS
WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF AREAS LEFT TO DECLARE FIFTY TWO PER CENT OF THE COUNTRY HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND FORTY EIGHT PER CENT TO REMAIN
UKIP'S LEADER NIGEL FIN RAJ HAS SAID IT'S AN HISTORIC DAY
JUMA TWENTY THIRD GO DOWN IN OUR HISTORY AS OUR INDEPENDENCE
THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGNER LABOUR'S SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY CHUKA SAID THIS THIS MOMENT THIS IS A SEISMIC MOMENT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT THIS IS EXPOSED AS A LOT OF DIVISION AND THERE'S A LOT TO TALK AS IF THIS IS AN OVERWHELMING WHEN IT ISN'T MESS FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE ON THE CURRENT PROJECTION WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR THIS STERLING HAS COLLAPSED ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS PLUNGING TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
MORE THAN EIGHTY CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE SIGNED A LETTER SAYING DAVID CAMERON HAS A DUTY TO STAY ON AS PRIME MINISTER
ALL THIRTY TWO LOCAL AUTHORITY AREAS IN SCOTLAND VOTED TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. AND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN TALK OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE PRIME MINISTER THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND GETTING REACTION TO A MOMENTOUS DECISION
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY ZEB SENSE AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS BRITAIN LOOK SENT TO END ITS MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. WITH NEARLY ALL OF THE VOTES IN THE HISTORIC REFERENDUM COUNTERED THE B. B. C. IS FORECASTING THAT LEAVE WILL WIN BY FOUR PER CENT THE RESULTS SO FAR SHOW THAT FIFTEEN AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE VOTED IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHILE SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION SAID THEY WANTED TO LEAVE TURNOUT WAS SEVENTY TWO PERCENT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN A NATIONWIDE BALLOT IN THE U.K. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO
SHORTLY AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED AT TEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT TO NEW OPINION POLL SUGGESTED A NARROW VICTORY FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN BUT IN THE HOURS THAT FOLLOWED UNEXPECTED RESULTS IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND PROMPTED A SWIFT CHANGE IN THE MOOD OR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
ALL NIGHT THE CONFIDENCE AMONG THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN STEADILY BUILDING AS VAST SWATHES OF THE COUNTRY VOTED FOR BRECHT'S IT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR REMAIN
FIFTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF LEAF WAS EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND
THE EARLY RESULTS FROM SUNDERLAND SIXTY ONE PER CENT IN FAVOUR OF LEAVE SET THE PATTERN FOR THE NIGHT WITH MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR AREAS PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH OPTING DECISIVELY FOR BRECHT'S IT
IN BARNSLEY IT WAS SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT SOUTH TYNESIDE SIXTY ONE PER CENT AND HARTLEPOOL SEVENTY PER CENT AND IN THOSE BIG METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE REMAIN HOPE TO DO WELL THE MARGIN OF THEIR VICTORY WAS MUCH LESS THAN EXPECTED IN NEWCASTLE AND SHEFFIELD THEY WON BY THE SLENDER WRIST OF MARGINS JUST FIFTY ONE PER CENT AND KEY CITIES AND TOWNS THERE TREMAYNE HAD BEEN HOPEFUL OF WINNING LIKE COVENTRY AND WATFORD
THEY LOST THE CITY OF DURHAM WHICH MANY ELECTION EXPERTS REGARDED AS A BELL THE RESULT WENT FAMILY FOR LEAVE BY FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT AND IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL BARRAGE WAS ALREADY SENSING VICTORY AT DAWN IS BREAKING ALL OF HIM THAT THEN DON'T YOU KNOW
IF THE PREDICTIONS NOW ARE RIGHT THIS WILL BE A VICTORY FOR REAL PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR DECENT
ONLY TWO LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO BUCK THIS TREND WERE LONDON AND SCOTLAND IN SCOTLAND WHERE ALL THIRTY TWO AREAS VOTED TO REMAIN THERE WAS A LOWER THAN EXPECTED TURNOUT OF SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
IN GLASGOW A STRONGLY PRO REMAIN CITY THE TURNOUT WAS JUST FIFTY SIX PER CENT
IN LONDON THERE WERE AS EXPECTED HUGE WINS FOR REMAIN LAMBETH SEVENTY NINE PER CENT ONES WORTH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND ISLINGTON SEVENTY PER CENT BUT SIGNIFICANTLY SOME OF THE POORER LABOUR AREAS SUCH AS BARKING AND DAGENHAM VOTED TO LEAVE
IN LABOUR RANKS THE RESULTS ARE CERTAIN TO PROMPT AN ANXIOUS DEBATE GIVEN SO MANY OF THE PARTY SUPPORTERS OPTED TO IGNORE THE APPEALS FROM THE LEADERSHIP TO BACK REMAIN IN WALES THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING VOTE IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S HAD WITH ONLY FOUR OF THE TWENTY TWO AREAS CHOOSING TO STAY LABOUR STRONGHOLDS LIKE MERTHYR TID PHIL NEWPORT IN CAERPHILLY ALL VOTED TO LEAVE SWANSEA TO BUY JUST FIFTY ONE PER CENT
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL THERE IS A DISAFFECTED VOTE AND HIS DISAFFECTED WITH POLITICS OVERALL DISAFFECTED WITH WESTMINSTER PARTIES IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THAT IS A LABOUR SUPPORTERS TOO LONG WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO TRY AND TURN THAT ROUND IT'S BEEN TOUGH AND THAT IS PETER IF IT GETS HER FEEL LIKE A BY ELECTION AT THE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE'S GRIEVANCES I'VE BEEN ED AS WELL AS A RESULT OF THIS VOTE
IN TORY CIRCLES THE RESULTS WILL COME AS A HAMMER BLOW TO MISTER CAMERON SENIOR BRECHT'S IT FIGURES LIKE BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO HAVE ALREADY SIGNED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR MISTER CAMERON REMAINING AS PRIME MINISTER HOWEVER ONE LEADING BRICKS IT FIGURE SUGGESTED WHILE MISTER CAMERON COULD STAY FOR A BIT GEORGE OSBORNE WOULD HAVE TO GO PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHTAWAY
THE RESULT OPENS A NEW CHAPTER IN BRITAIN'S HISTORY FORTY YEARS AFTER THE BRITISH ELECTORATE VOTED DECISIVELY TO JOIN WHAT WAS THEN THE COMMON MARKET BRITAIN HAS NOW DECIDED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE POUND INITIALLY ROSA'S TRADERS RESPONDED TO NEW OPINION POLLS IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN THAT IT QUICKLY FELL AS THE RESULTS STARTED COMING IN THE VALUE OF STERLING THEN TUMBLED THROUGH THE NIGHT AND HAS NOW FALLEN TO A THIRTY YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR MORE DETAILS FROM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMMAND AHMED
AS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT LEAVE WAS A HEADING FOR VICTORY STERLING TOOK THE BRUNT OF INVESTORS FEARS AS IT PLUNGED IN VALUE TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE IN DRAMATIC OVERNIGHT MARKET STERLING SWAN WILDLY WITH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY GREATER THAN DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THE BLACK WEDNESDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN THE POUND FELL OUT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM
STIRLING HIT A RECORD HIGH FOR THE YEAR SHORTLY AFTER THE POLLS CLOSE LAST NIGHT WHEN REMAIN APPEAR TO HAVE PERFORMED STRONGLY IT THEN FELL SHARPLY STOCK MARKETS WERE ALSO JITTERY THE JAPANESE MCCAY WAS DOWN TO THREE PER CENT OVERNIGHT AND FOOTSIE FEATURES WHICH PRECEDES THE OPENING OF THE LONDON MARKETS WAS DOWN TO SIX PER CENT
IT IS LIKELY THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO REASSURE MARKETS BUT IT WILL MAINTAIN FINANCIAL STABILITY BY THE PROVISION OF SUPPORT FOR BANKS
WITH SOME LEAF CAMPAIGNERS SUGGESTING THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE AUTUMN A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG CONSIDERS WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THE PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST COLLEAGUES USED TO SAY HE WAS A LUCKY POLITICIAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS CAREER HIS LUCK HAS DRAMATICALLY RUN OUT IN A SNUB TO HIM A SNUB TO THE STATUS QUO HAD A SNUB TO THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT BRITAIN HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TEAR UP THE SETTLEMENT THE COUNTRY'S HAD FOR DECADES UNLEASHING PERHAPS HUGE OPPORTUNITY OR PERHAPS HUGE RISK
PERHAPS BOTH THE COUNTRY'S DECISION CHANGES ALMOST EVERYTHING ALL THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN THE BRITISH MOTORIST TEND TO VOTE FOR WHAT THE CONSENSUS TELLS THEM HE'S THEIR ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST AND THAT REFERENDA THOSE VOTES WHERE THERE WAS ONLY BLACK AND WHITE NO SHADES OF GREY TEND TO PRODUCE THE STATUS QUO
AND IT COULD NOW SHATTERED THE PRIME MINISTER'S CAREER DESPITE PUBLIC PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY LETTERS FROM LOYALISTS PROMISES OF SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER'S TIME IN OFFICE MAY WELL BE CURTAILED THE TENSION CAN HE STAY IN OFFICE WITH HIS AUTHORITY DRAINED BY A DEFEAT OR WILKIE ENDEAVOUR TO STAY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE STABILITY AT A TIME OF CHANGE AND IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS OFFICIALLY PASSED THE WINNING POST IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SIX AND SARAH KEITH LUCAS IS AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE MORNING SARAH MORNING WE'VE GOT A QUIETER DAY TODAY IN TERMS OF THE WEATHER WE'RE LOSING THOSE BIG THUNDERSTORMS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE SOUTH EAST OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS A FRESHER FEEL TO THE WEATHER TODAY CERTAINLY LESS HUMID AND HIS WILL BE A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SCATTERED SHOWERS
STARTING OFF WITH THE DETAIL FOR THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND EASTERN ENGLAND AND THE EAST MIDLANDS HERE IT'S A LARGELY DRY CLEAR MORNING AND THROUGH THE DAY A LOT OF DRY WEATHER ON THE CARDS WITH SOME SUNSHINE JUST THE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED SHOWER AND TEMPERATURES IN LONDON TWENTY TWO DEGREES
FOR THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES THE WEST MIDLANDS AND THE WHOLE OF NORTHERN ENGLAND MAINLY DRY FIRST THING JUST ONE OR TWO SHOWERS WILL START TO SEE THOSE SHOWERS BECOMING HEAVIER AND MORE FREQUENT LATE IN THE DAY THEY'LL BE HIT AND MISS SOME DRY WEATHER IN BETWEEN WITH LIGHT WINDS TO THE SHOWERS COULD BE QUITE HEAVY AND THUNDERY PARTICULAR ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND AND WALES TO THE TEMPERATURES IN BETWEEN THOSE SHOWERS AROUND NINETEEN OR TWENTY DEGREES
LASTLY FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND A DAY OF SUNNY INTERVALS AND SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS BRINGING SOME HAIL AND SOME THUNDER AT TIMES TOO IF YOU DO CATCH ONE IT COULD BE HEAVY AND SLOW MOVING BUT SOME DRY WEATHER IN BETWEEN THOSE SHOWERS AND TEMPERATURES OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES
AS FOR THE WEEKEND SATURDAY BRINGS US ANOTHER DAY OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS BY THE TIME WE GET TO SUNDAY DRY AND BRIGHT WEATHER TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND THE EAST MORE RAIN HEADING INTO THE NORTH WEST
THANK YOU SARAH TEN PAST SIX SO WE HEARD IN THE LAST LITERALLY THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES THAT AND LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS OFFICIALLY PASSED THE WINNING POST PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS IS PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH PULLING COUNSEL YOU WON'T BE DESPERATELY SURPRISE JOHN BECAUSE YOU'D REFUSED TO MAKE A FORECAST FOR THIS ONE YOU SAID IT WAS TOO CLOSE A CALL PRETTY MUCH ALL THE WAY ALONG I GUESS IT WAS ALWAYS TOO CLOSE TO CALL AND THEY OF COURSE ALTHOUGH THE POLES DIDN'T AGREE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
THOSE POLES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OVER THE INTERNET HAD CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN ALL THE WAY BACK SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER SAID THAT THIS WAS A FIFTY FIFTY SHOT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PHONE POLLS TO AT THE END STILL HAD THEY REMAIN CIDER HEAD THEY HAD INDICATED THAT THE POSITION WAS NOW I'M GOING TO DO IT IF YOU LOOKED IN DETAIL AT THE POLES IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR EVEN BEFORE A BALLOT BOX WAS OPENED THAT ACTUALLY THE LEAVES SITE HAS CERTAINLY WON THE CAMPAIGN WHAT JUST REMAINED IN DARK WAS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE DONE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY WIN THE OVERALL
AND I KNOW WE'VE NEVER HAD A REFERENDUM LIKE THIS BEFORE WE MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT AGAIN I SUPPOSE BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK'S WON
I THINK A NUMBER OF THINGS I MEAN THE FIRST IS UNDOUBTEDLY IMMIGRATION WAS THE KEY CARD THAT THEY REMAIN SIDE HARD AND CRUCIALLY WHETHER CAME TO IMMIGRATION VOTERS BOTH THOUGHT THAT STAYING IN THE AIR WAS A PROBLEM ARE YOU TOO MUCH IMMIGRATION THAT LEAVING WOULD PROVIDE A SOLUTION THAT IS THAT IMMIGRATION WERE GO DOWN NOW IT'S TRUE THAT MANY OF VOTER WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE CONVINCED THAT ACTUALLY THINGS WOULD GET BETTER IF WE WOULD STAY SO IT WAS ALREADY A VERY ONE SIDED ARGUMENT AND THEN I THINK THE CRUCIAL MISTAKE THAT THE REMAIN SIDE MADE IF THEY FRANKLY OVER EGGED THE PUDDING I THINK THE MOMENT THAT YOU SAW FOR EXAMPLE THAT MOST PEOPLE SAID WE JUST DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WORSE OFF BY TWENTY THIRTY THE PONY GOVERNANCE OF THE CHANCEL IN PARTICULAR
WAS REGARDED AS LESS PERSUASIVE THAN ANY OTHER OF THE SENIOR POLITICIANS EVOLVED THE CAMPAIGN I THINK WAS AN INDICATION THAT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS TOO MUCH RELIANCE ON A. NEGATIVE ECONOMIC MESSAGE AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING VERY MUCH IN THE REMAIN CAN'T PAY DECIDE IF I JUST LOOK IF WE VOTE TO REMAIN THIS IS HOW YOUR LIVES WILL GET BETTER THAT WAS FRANKLY VIRTUALLY ENTIRELY MISSING PAGE IN THERE REMAINED A BOOK
JOHN CURTIS MANY BANKS IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX WELL STERLING HAS TAKEN A HUGE HIT IN REACTION TO THE NEWS THAT WE'RE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER A SHARP RISE JUST BEFORE THE POLLS CLOSED LAST NIGHT STERLING HAS SINCE SLUMPED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THIRTY YEARS AGAINST THE DOLLAR NOW BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACKERS AT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY SCHROEDER'S IN THE CITY AND SIMON WHAT'S THE MOOD
WELL PEOPLE ARE SHELL SHOCKED QUITE FRANKLY SARAH AND WE WOULD LIKE THAT HEARING ABOUT THE POLES THERE WE WERE WONDERING WHETHER THE POLES HAVE GOT IT RIGHT OR WHETHER THE CITY YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT BECAUSE AS YOU RIGHTLY SAY AS THE POLLS CLOSED A POUND WAS RISING IT WAS WORTH A DOLLAR FIFTY THE CITY WERE CALLING IT THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD IT IN THE BAG AND BOY WERE THEY WRONG AND THAT MEANS WE HAD AN ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE FALL IN STIRLING OVER TEN PER CENT
THAT IS TO THAT IS TWICE AS MUCH AS STERLING FELL ON BLACK WEDNESDAY SO YOU HAD TWO BLACK WEDNESDAY'S IN ONE MORNING STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD WILL FALL THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET WAS ALREADY DOWN TO SEVEN AND A HALF PER CENT THERE ARE PREDICTIONS AND THE FUTURES MARKET IS SAYING THAT HE WILL HAVE THE SAME THING
WHEN MARKETS OPEN SO REAL SHOCKWAVES BEING SENT RIGHT THROUGH THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND BEFORE MARKETS OPEN THERE WE ARE EXPECTING SOME SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR YET THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY WILL SAY SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WE STAND READY TO PUMP AND EXTRA MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM THERE'S A QUESTION OF LIQUIDITY CAN YOU SELL STUFF WHEN YOU WANT TO SELL IT IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY SLOSHING AROUND THE SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT OF PEOPLE
HANGING ON TO IT IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS I SHOULD SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT PEOPLE'S BANK DEPOSITS AREN'T AT RISK IN THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT BUT FOR THE INTER BANK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS LIQUIDITY WILL BE AT A PREMIUM THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR WILL PROBABLY COME OUT AND SAY WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WE PREPARED FOR IT AND YOU CAN COME TO US AND WE'LL PUT THAT MONEY IN BUT AS I SAY THE REAL SHOCK WAVES
AND THE TALKING HERE AMONGST THE TRADERS IS ALREADY ABOUT MANY JOBS MIGHT LEAVE LONDON AS A RESULT OF THIS OF COURSE WE'VE GOT WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS TO UNPICK ALL OF THIS BUT SEVERAL OF THE BIG BANKS HERE SAID THAT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THEY MIGHT RELOCATE STAFF SO THAT'S THE CHATTER AROUND THE WATER COOLER PRETTY SHELL SHOCKED CHATTER IN I MUST SAY IN LONDON AND AS FAR AS THE SHORT TERM IS CONCERNED YES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF COMMENTS ABOUT STABILITY WE'VE HAD
UNIVERSITIES MINISTER JOE JOHNSON WHO WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER TALKING TWEETING BIG DECISION LET'S MAKE IT WORK THERE'S GOING TO BE LOT OF THAT SORT OF CREATION OF MOOD BUT AS FAR
OR IS THERE MORE THAT COULD MEASURES THAT COULD BE TAKEN IF THERE IS HUGE VOLATILITY ON THE MARKET FOR EXAMPLE A SUSPENSION OF TRADING IN THE U.S. THE FUTURES MARKET HE'S ALREADY BEEN SUSPENDED THERE ISN'T THERE SAYING YOU CANNOT TRADE BELOW A CERTAIN PRICE UNTIL THEIR MARKET OPENS
AT TWO THIRTY NINE THIRTY THEIR TIME SO SOME MARKETS ALREADY BEEN SUSPENDED I WOULD NOT EXPECT THE LONDON STOCK MARKET OPEN ON TIME THIS MORNING THERE WILL BE YOU KNOW THERE'LL BE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS THEY'LL BE YOU WON'T OPEN IT IS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THE CITY THAT THIS MORNING THAT'S FOR SURE WHETHER IT WILL THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THIS QUESTION MARK WHERE THE TREASURE OF THE PROPERTY I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN I THINK THAT WOULD SEND A VERY BAD SIGN AND WOULDN'T STOP MARKET TERMS
WE'VE SEEN FALLS LIKE THIS BEFORE IT'S STIRLING WHERE WE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE AS A TWO TIMES THE DROP WE SAW ON BLACK WEDNESDAY BETTER BUSINESS VERY MUCH NOT AS USUAL IN THE CITY SIMON JACK FOR THE MOMENT THANKS VERY MUCH SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE OFFICIAL RESULT WILL BE ANNOUNCED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WE'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WHERE OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IS AT THE MANCHESTER TOWN HALL WHERE IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN ROSS ANY IDEA WHEN
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOME TIME OVER BREAKFAST DEPENDS WHEN THEY WANT THEIR BREAKFAST BUT IN ESSENCE WE ALREADY KNOW IT'S ALMOST BY THE BY REMARKABLE NIGHT HERE EUROSCEPTICS CONSERVATIVES IN UKIP EMBRACING EACH OTHER TEARS IN THEIR EYES THE MOST REMARKABLE NIGHT OF THEIR POLITICAL LIVES WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IS GEESE THERE STUART
THE LABOUR LEADER IS GOING TO TRAVEL FROM HERE TO LONDON SHE'S EXPECTED TO MEET WITH MICHAEL GO FROM BORIS JOHNSON I'M TOLD HE'S HAVING A BIT OF SLEEP AT THE MOMENT AND EXPECT SOME SORT OF JOINT STATEMENT FROM THEM IN EFFECT VOTE LEAST POSITION WE ARE IN A REMARKABLE PLACE AT THE MOMENT JOHN WHERE POLITICAL POWER DOES NOT REST WHO THE AT NUMBER TEN SO YOU CAN EXPECT TO HEAR THE PRIME MINISTER AND MERGE AT SOME POINT PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT STABILITY AND THE NEED FOR THE PARTY TO COME
TOGETHER BUT THE KEY IMMEDIATE QUESTION IS HIS FUTURE AND THEIR GREAT GREAT QUANDARY HERE IS THE LEVERS INSIST THEY WANT HIM TO STAY ON BUT IN ESSENCE ENTIRELY ON THEIR TERMS DON'T WANT THE MEDIA RESHUFFLE THEY SAY BUT IN ESSENCE DOWN THE LINE THEY WANT GEORGE OSBORNE GONE THEY WANT MICHAEL GAVE ME CHIEF NEGOTIATOR MAYBE CHANCE THROUGH A FOREIGN SECRETARY THEY WANT TO SACK INDIVIDUAL MINISTERS LIKE DAVID LIVINGSTONE
IN ESSENCE WHAT LEVER OFFERING THE PRIME MINISTER IS THE JOB AT NUMBER TEN PURSUING A POLICY HE NEVER WANTED WITH THE CABINET HE HASN'T CHOSEN THE QUESTION HAS TO BE DOES HE ACCEPT THAT HE CAN'T REALLY CAMMY
WELL SO HE PUT THE WAY YOU'VE JUST PUT IT IT WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY POSITION TO BE IN AS PRIME MINISTER AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT THIS IS A DECISION THAT HE IS HAVING TO MAKE NOW AND OF COURSE IF HE DECIDES TO GO HE STARTS THE GUN ON A LEADERSHIP CONTEST HE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY STAY ROUND IN THE SHORT TERM WHILST THE COUNTRY FACES
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS WILL THE UNITED KINGDOM SPLIT UP WITH TALKER ALEX SALMOND DEMANDING ANOTHER REFERENDUM MICHAEL MARTIN MCGUINNESS IS CALLING FOR A BORDER POLL WHETHER NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD REMAIN PART OF THE U.K. AND THAT'S EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO THE ISSUE OF THE VAST GULF
BETWEEN THE POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE BIG PARTIES AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE ELECTORATE WHO IN SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS REJECTED EVERYTHING THAT THEY DATED TO HEAR ROSS
EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WHEN WE WERE HEARING ABOUT THE EFFECT ON THE POUND OF THIS NEWS OUR BUSINESS PRESENTER DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS ON THE TRADING FLOOR A U. B'S IN THE CITY THIS MORNING AND CAN GIVE US THE LATEST FROM THERE DOMINIC IT'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU I'M IN THE HEART OF THE SQUARE MILE AS YOU SAID AND U.B.S. THE GIANT SWISS BANK IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING OUTSIDE BLUE SKY BRIGHT SUNSHINE
FOR MANY OF THOSE WHO WORK IN THE CITY IT'S A SOMBRE AND QUITE A SHOCKING DAY OVERNIGHT AS MARKETS HAVE DIGESTED THE LIKELY RESULT CONFIRMED THE RESULT THAT BRITAIN WILL LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE POUND HAS FALLEN FAST AND HARD IT CLOSE AND UNDERNEATH THAT JUST UNDER ONE DOLLAR FIFTY YOUR POUND BUY YOU ONE AMERICAN DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS AND IT'S FALLEN DOWN TO ONE DONNA THIRTY FOUR THAT'S A FALL OF NEARLY TEN PER CENT AND JUST TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT BACK ON BLACK WEDNESDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN BRITAIN IF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM IT FELL BY ONLY FOUR PER CENT SO NEXT TO BLACK WEDNESDAY
IN A FEW HOURS AND WHAT MAKES IT ALL THE WORSE FOR THOSE COMING TO WORK HERE IN THE CITY IS THAT MOST OF THEM CALLED AT WRONG YESTERDAY THE POUND STRENGTHENED A LITTLE BIT THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED WHICH TRACKS LEADING SHARES WAS UP ONE PER CENT I'M JOINED BY A GROUP OF CITY LEADERS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED AND FIRST I GO TO BELOW MEAL HIT OF U.K. INVESTMENT YOU B'S WEALTH MANAGEMENT BILL COULD YOU SUM UP TO US JUST HOW SHOCKING THIS IS FOR A LOT OF YOUR PEERS
CLEARLY THEY'RE CAUGHT SHE SAY IT WAS WRONG GOING INTO THE BOATS AND THE RESULTS AND HAVE THAT'S REFLECTED MAKIN THE ACTIONS AND YOU TEN PER CENT WHAT I THINK I GET THE SENSE THAT THE OFFSHORE REACTION IS ALMOST AS FEROCIOUS AS THE ON SHORE ARE CLEARLY THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK THROUGH SOME TIME TO DIGEST THIS IT'S A MULTI DIMENSIONAL
UP FOR A VENT I THINK CLEARLY THIS MORNING MARKETS IN THE CITY WILL BE FOCUSING ON THE
FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT OF THE FIRE BRIGADE IN OTHER WORDS THE CENTRAL BANKS AND PARTICULARLY OUR OWN CENTRAL BANK I THINK WHAT THE EFFORT HERE WILL BE TO BASICALLY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE MARKET SO THEY CAN TRADE IN A CALM FASHION AND HE CAN GET THROUGH THIS WHAT OF SIR THOMAS THE VOLATILITY TIE DOWN BUT IT IS A MULTI DIMENSIONAL
THE CONSEQUENCE ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS FROM POLITICS RIGHT THROUGH I THINK THE OTHER PART OF ALL THIS IS OVER THE WEEKEND WE HAVE THE SPANISH ELECTIONS A SETTER IS TO TAKE ON BOARD WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION REACTION WILL BE AS WELL BECAUSE IT HAS SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FROM MARKETS THERE AS WELL WE THINK THERE WILL BE SOME EFFORT TO SORT OF AGAIN ADDRESS THE VOICE OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC
I'M JOINED BY MIKE AMY AND MANAGING GREAT TRIP ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BOMB MANAGERS MIKE CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS THE POUND FALLING SO QUICKLY WHAT ARE TRADERS DOING TO MAKE IT GO
O.K. WELL THERE ARE THERE ARE TWO FACTORS HERE THE FIRST IS AS BILL MENTIONED THE FOCUS OR MOVE ON TO CENTRAL BANKS AND THE CHANCE OF
OF THE BANK REALLY CUTTING RATES SO A LOWER INTEREST RATE MAKES THE POUND RELATIVELY LESS ATTRACTIVE BUT I THINK THE BIGGER MOVE IS IS ONE OF
IT'S NOT A POLITICAL RISK PREMIUM WE NOW MOVE INTO A PERIOD OF QUITE PROFOUND UNCERTAINTY IS DAVID CAMERON GOING TO LEAD THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT ARE WE GOING TO BE IN FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT WHAT IS GOING TO BE A TRADING RELATION WITH EUROPE AND THAT POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AS I THINK THAT'S REALLY GOT THE GOING IT'S MARCUS DOGS YOU DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY AND CURRENCIES IN PARTICULAR DON'T LIKE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
THAT'S WHY I CAN JUST AND JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE EXPECT FROM DAVID CAMERON SHORTLY AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT PROBABLY
FROM MARK CARNEY BECOME OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE OTHER THING WE CAN TALK ABOUT COUNTIES BUT THE OTHER THING OF COURSE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STOCK MARKET AND WE'RE JOINED BY ANN RICHARDS A CHEAPIE TICKET HAVE BEEN N.G. ASSET MANAGER ONE OF HER BIGGEST FUND MANAGERS AND IT'S GOING TO BE A TUMULTUOUS MORNING FOR THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED I SUSPECT I THINK IT WILL BE PRETTY BOUNCY THIS MORNING WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE THEIR SIT DOWN SOMETHING BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN PERCENT BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT MARKETS IS THAT THEY ARE GREAT DISCOUNTING MECHANISM SAY THEY FORWARD LOOKING NOT LOOKING
AND IN SOME SENSES WE HAVE NOW PASSED TO THE POINT WHERE WE WILL PASS THE POINT OF MAXIMUM UNCERTAINTY THIS MORNING SO WE WILL GO THROUGH A VERY TURBULENT PERIOD THIS MORNING AND THEIR MARKETS WILL QUICKLY ADJUST TO THAT NEW REALITY SO WHAT THE SHEARS THIS MORNING WILL BE REFLECTING IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PUT THE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC AFTERMATH WILL BE
OF THE RESULT OF THIS REFERENDUM BUT VERY QUICKLY HE WILL START TO SAY WILL THERE BE SOME BENEFITS TO TO BUSINESS IN THE U.K. FROM THIS IN PARTICULARLY THE LARGEST COMPANY SOMETHING LIKE TWO THIRDS OR MORE OF THEIR EARNINGS COME FROM OVERSEAS SO THE WEAKNESS THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS MORNING IN STERLING WILL ACTUALLY START TO BENEFIT SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES RELATIVELY QUICKLY
SO I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY PAINFUL TODAY AND THEN WE'LL START TO SEE MARKETS LOOKING THROUGH THAT THROUGH THAT FROM THIS NEW LOWER LEVEL AS WE GO ON AND HAS HAD TO BE MENTIONED WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THE ATTENTION WE'VE AWAY FROM THE U.K. TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR THE EURO AND FOR EUROPEAN MARKET SO I THINK TODAY IS THE EYE OF THE STORM BUT WE WILL START TO MOVE THROUGH THIS AS WE GO INTO NEXT WEEK
YES THAT'S A GOOD POINT IT'S WORTH MOVING THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT THE BANKER JAPAN THIS IS GOING TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE NOW TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TURNING OUT TO NIGEL WILSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE LEGAL AND GENERAL ONE OF HER BIGGEST INSURANCE COMPANY PUT ONE HUNDRED SURE AND I DO A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS IS VERY STRANGE BECAUSE HOW OVERNIGHT CAME THE POUND FALL SO MUCH IT'S NOT BECAUSE IF THE U.K. ECONOMY SUDDENLY WORTH THAT MUCH LIST OR ITS PROSPECTS ARE MUCH POORER WHAT'S GOING ON
I THINK IT'S A CALL BY THE ELECTRIC FOR THE POLITICAL AND BUSINESS LEADERS TO STEP UP IN THE IN THE U.K. THIS SHOULDN'T COME AS A SHOCK TO MOST PEOPLE IN THE U.K. BECAUSE IN FACT THEY HAVE VOTED FOR THE THE OUTCOME OF THAT WE'VE GOT IT'S A HUGE SHOCK HERE IN THE CITY BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS IN THE INK AND EFFECTIVELY IN THINKING I LIKE THAT EXACTLY THE SAME LINES
HOWEVER WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A COOL HEAD AND ACTUALLY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THE ECONOMY GROW AND MAKE PEOPLE IN IN OUR SOCIETY BETTER OFF AS A HALL BECAUSE CLEARLY THE RICH RICHARD BEEN SHOUTING VERY LOUDLY THE POOR TELLING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO DO
AND HE VOTED AGAINST IT LARGELY AND SONG WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE INVESTMENT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN WE NEED MORE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING IN HEALTH CARE IN EDUCATION AND IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN GENERAL AND WE'VE HAD A SHORTAGE OF INVESTMENT NOT JUST ONE OR TWO YEARS BUT FOR THE LAST TWENTY HOURS HERE IN THE U.K. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH HOPING THAT WE CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH
POLITICAL LEADERS AND BITTER SAINT LEADERS COLLABORATE TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE ECONOMY AND NOT JUST FOR LONDON
JUST TURNING UP ON THEM ON THAT POINT ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE WHAT COMPANIES DO IT THE NIGHT DOES IT
NO IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WHAT PEEP PEOPLE DO OVERNIGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A STATE OF SHOCK AS AND SAID TO TODAY JUST BY THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO REMAIN EVEN THOUGH THE PAUL TO BEEN TELLING US FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT WAS IT WAS VERY CLOTS THAT TURNED OUT THE POULTS TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE ACCURATE IN THIS THIS THIS INSTANCE BUT ACTUALLY
COMPANIES WILL BE PEOPLE WILL BE TURNING UP TO WORK TODAY AND DOING EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID YESTERDAY THE WHOLE PROCESS OF HOW WE EXIT FROM YOU AT IT IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXIT COS WILL STILL CONTINUE TO TRADE WILL GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH LARGE PARTS OF EUROPE
IT'S A WAKE UP CALL TO ALL OF THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL LEADERS THE PEOPLE A BIT FED UP YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD Q.E. ONE WHICH HAS LED TO ASSET PRICE INFLATION BUT IT'S NOT LED TO REAL WAGE INFLATION IT'S NOT LED TO PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO ECONOMICS ONE OR ONE AND GET POLITICAL BLEEDERS DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER TO THEIR ELECTORATE
MIKE IF I COULD JUST COME BACK TO YOU QUICKLY WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT WHAT'S GOING THROUGH MARK CARNEY'S MIND AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT MIGHT HE SAY WIN HE DOES EVENTUALLY SPEAK
I THINK I THINK THEY'LL BE TWO THINGS ON MARK ON IS ONE OF THE FIRST WILL BE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR THE ECONOMY I THINK I THINK PROBABLY IN THE SHORTER TERM IT WILL BE IN HIS ROLE AS GUARDIAN OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AND HE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE VOLATILITY OF THE MARKETS THE BANQUET IS REALLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW CASH TO BANKS IN THE EVENT THEY EXTRA LIQUIDITY
I THINK HE'S HIS FOCUS WILL BE ON MAKING SURE THAT MARKETS CLEAR TODAY YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT LEVELS BUT THE CRUCIAL FACTORIES IS WHETHER PEOPLE CAN BUY OR SELL SECURITIES IF THEY CAN DO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE THE PRICE BUT IF THEY CAN DO THAT THEN I THINK HE WILL BE HE WILL FEEL REASSURED SO THE KEY THING IS IS TO KEEP THOSE FINANCIAL MARKETS RUNNING HE DOESN'T WANT A SEIZURE AS WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EXACTLY THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT THE LEVEL OF THE MARKET IS NOT REALLY HIS ISSUE SO MUCH TODAY IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TRANSACT THAT'S WHAT HE WILL BE FOCUSED ON
IF I COME BACK TO YOU BILL YOUR JOBS AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE BE DOING THIS MORNING WHAT INDIVIDUALS BE DOING IF THEY'RE LOOKING AT MARKETS PLUNGING AND THE PAN GOING DOWN WITH YOU ADVISED THEM TO TAKE AN EQUALLY QUICK ACTION NO I THINK IT'S CALLED CAM BASICALLY FOR NOW LESS SANTA BE LET BASICALLY THE VOLATILITY WALK THROUGH
LET'S GET A SENSE OF BEASTLY WORRIED THE DIRECTION OF POLICY TO SOME DEGREE IS GOING EARLY DAYS YES BUT WE'VE BEEN VERY MUCH EMPHASISING WITH OUR CLIENTS HERE THAT WE WON GLOBAL PORTFOLIO WHICH COULD HAVE EXPOSURE TO A WHOLE SELECTION OF MARKETS AND SECTORS AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST THE U.K. AND EVEN IF YOU KICK CLIMBED HERE YOU'RE STILL EXPOSED TO MULTIPLE MARKETS ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THE U.K.
AND WHIPPED IMPORTANT TO EMPHASISE THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE SAID EARLIER ON YOU KNOW WITH THE DOS WILL CIRCLE THERE WILL BE VALUED THERE AND CERTAIN ASSETS AND WE HAVE TO BASICALLY DRAW A CLIENT'S TOWARDS THERE WAS OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW IT IS IN SOME RESPECTS THEY REALITY WE'RE NOT
COMPACTLY SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE FULL RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS ARE THEY TO PLAY OUT ALL FOR MAYBE A YEAR IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY LONGER BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MISSED PRICING A SEARCHER BUT THE IMPORTANT THING FROM A CLYDESIDE IS ACTED TO RUN A VERY BROAD BASE OF EXPOSURES OF COURSE ASSETS
COMING BACK TO YOU EM A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TO WORK HERE IN THE SQUARE MILE THIS MORNING HEY THEY'LL BE SHOCKED BY IT BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED OVERNIGHT AND BY THE RESULT WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE SQUARE MILE IN THE BRITISH ECONOMY BO DO WILL THEY SWEET CHANGE WHAT THEY DO WHERE PEOPLE WORK THOSE VERY BASIC THING
I THINK THE THE HISTORY OF THE SQUARE MILE HAS BEEN ONE OF CONSTANT CHANGE AND EVOLUTION AND IT HAS PROVEN REMARKABLY ADEPT OVER MANY MANY MANY YEARS TO TO CHANGING TO SHIFT INTO SHAPE IT WITH THE NEW CONDITIONS AND I THINK WE WILL SEE THE CITY
DO EXACTLY THAT YET AGAIN THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES OF BEING PART OF A LARGE ECONOMIC BLOCK AND THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES OF BEING OUTSIDE THAT BLOCK AND I THINK WHAT YOU SEE THE CITY TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT WHERE IT CAN FIND THOSE ADVANTAGES MAYBE WAS NOT SORT OF THEM YET BUT WHERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING OUTSIDE RATHER THAN INSIDE AND THAT WILL BE ALL THE BUSINESSES AROUND US ARE TRYING TO DO
THERE'S ALWAYS A BIG SHOCK LEADS TO A BIG OPPORTUNITY LISTEN THANK YOU MUCH TO ALL MY GUESTS THANK YOU EMMA RICHARDS I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH ONE NUMBER SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POINT ONE THAT WAS WHAT THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED CLOSED LAST NIGHT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT OPENS THE SPORT

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NINTH THE REMAIN SIDE APPEARED HOPEFUL OF VICTORY BUT THIS WAS TO CHANGE HIS LEAVE PERFORMED STRONGLY AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT AREAS ESPECIALLY THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND WHERE TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTERS DEFIED THEIR PARTY STANCE AND BACK TO BRITISH EXIT REMAIN HAD ALSO BEEN RELYING ON BIG CITIES TO HELP THEM WIN WITH THEIR MARGIN OF VICTORY THERE WAS MUCH SLIMMER THAN HAD BEEN EXPECTED
IN WALES THERE WAS AN EMPHATIC VOTE IN FAVOUR OF BRICKS IT WITH ONLY FIVE OF TWENTY TWO AREAS CHOOSING TO STAYING IN SCOTLAND ALL THIRTY TWO AREAS VOTED TO REMAIN LONDON WAS ALSO STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARRAJ CENTRE THAT DAWN WAS BREAKING ON AN INDEPENDENT UNITED KINGDOM AND THAT THE OUTCOME REPRESENTED A VICTORY FOR REAL PEOPLE THE ENERGY SECRETARY ANDREA LETS OTHER PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER DESCRIBED THE RESULT AS FANTASTIC NEWS
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON IMMEDIATELY HINTED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM SHE SAID YE E. YOU VOTE HAD MADE CLEAR THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SAW THEIR FUTURE AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
STIRLING HAS SUFFERED HIS BIGGEST ONE DAY FOR THE VALUE OF THE POUND HAS DROPPED TO JUST UNDER ONE DOLL AT THIRTY FIVE LEVEL NOT SEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE EURO HAS ALSO WEAKENED AGAINST THE DOLLAR THERE'VE BEEN DRAMATIC FALLS ON STOCK MARKETS IN THE FAR EAST IN JAPAN THE NICK EH INDEX WAS DOWN BY EIGHT PER CENT HANG SENG IN HONG KONG FELL BY FIVE PER CENT
THE DEFEAT FOR DAVID CAMERON'S REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS LED TO QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FUTURE AS PRIME MINISTER LABOUR SAID HE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER HIS POSITION
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES SEVEN THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT A NIGHT IT'S THE NORMAN SMITH AS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR THEY STARTED WITH HOPES THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN BUT QUICKLY DASH NORMAN AND I THINK THE STORY OF THE NIGHT JOHN IS THAT IF YOU STRIP OUT LONDON AND SCOTLAND
THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY ACTUALLY TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YES THERE WERE SOME POCKETS OF PRO REMAIN PLACES LIKE BRISTOL THAN OXFORD MORE AFFLUENT MORE GRADUATE DOMINATED PLACES BUT BROADLY SPEAKING OUTSIDE OF LONDON AND SCOTLAND THE COUNTRY VOTED TO LEAVE AND EVEN IN THOSE CITIES WHERE THEY REMAIN CAMPED THOUGHT THEY MIGHT DO WELL PACE LIKE SHEFFIELD OR NEWCASTLE ACTUALLY THEY JUST SCRAPED A WIN
FIFTY ONE PER CENT AND THE MOST STRIKING STORY I THINK IS THE WAY THE TRADITIONAL LABOUR HEARTLANDS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY AND IN HUGE NUMBERS
TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SO YOU LOOK AT PLACES LIKE BARNSLEY SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING HARTLEPOOL SEVENTY PER CENT CORBY SIXTY FOUR PER CENT YOU LOOK AT WALES SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY TWO LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WALES VOTED TO LEAVE TRADITIONAL OR LABOUR BASTIONS LIKE MERTHYR TID VILLE TO PHILLY NEWPORT ALL VOTING TO LEAVE AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TOO
POINT TO A VERY DIVIDED BRITAIN BECAUSE
YES OF COURSE THIS WAS A VOTE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YES OF COURSE IT WAS A VOTE IN PART ABOUT IMMIGRATION BUT I THINK TO GIVE THEM THAT REVOLT IN THE LABOUR HEARTLANDS IT REFLECTS A DEEPER DISQUIET ANXIETY AMONGST MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS WELL OFF THAT THEY FEEL THEY NEVER GET TO WALK ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET IT'S IN PART I THINK A CONSEQUENCE OF A LONG PERIOD OF AUSTERITY A LONG PERIOD
DISENCHANTMENT GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BANKING CRISIS AND I THINK THAT IN PART HAS FUELLED THIS REVOLT AMONGST THE SORT OF TRADITIONAL LABOUR HEARTLANDS DESPITE THE PLEAS OF THE PARTY LEADERSHIP RIGHT SO WHERE DO WE GO NOW FIRST OF ALL WHAT ABOUT MISTER CAMERON AND HIS POSITION WELL I EXPECT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PRIME MINISTER SHORTLY PROBABLY BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK I THINK WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY IN AN EFFORT TO CALM THE MARKETS MY CAMERA AND I EXPECT WILL STRESS
THE NEED FOR CALM FOR STABILITY FOR UNITY I AM TOLD SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT WITH BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GOES BUT DISCUSSIONS WILL HAVE TO BEGIN SOON CERTAINLY WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS MISTER CAMERON IS BEING URGED BY LEADING BRECHT SITTERS NOT TO DO ANYTHING RASH NOT TO SUDDENLY INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY AND CATAPULT US INTO THE DEPARTURE PROCESS
ELSEWHERE THE BRAKES ARE TEARS ARE SAYING THEY WILL HAVE TO BE A CABINET RESHUFFLE TO REFLECT THE WAY THE NATION HAS VOTED AND THEN THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE A GREED BINDS A CABINET AND WHEN I ASKED ONE LEADING BRECHT'S A TEAR COULD MISTER CAMERON LEAD THE NEGOTIATIONS HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AS IF I WAS MAD OTHER LEADING BRECK'S AT FIGURES HAVE SAID TO ME QUITE A FEW OF THEM THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S POSITION IS UNTENABLE AND HE WILL HAVE TO GO ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND HAVE THE GRAND SCALE OF THINGS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE POLITICAL MISCALCULATION BY DAVID CAMERON I MEAN IT'S ALMOST ON A PAR WITH SUEZ IN FACT I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER THAN SEWERS IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS LORNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT LET'S TALK TO A LABOUR M.P. KATE HOEY A LABOUR LEAVE M. P. THAT IS SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT YOUR
PARTY IT SEEMS FOR YOUR TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN HEARING VOTED AGAINST YOUR PARTY'S LEADERSHIP ABSOLUTELY SOME OF US LIVE RELIEVES THOSE SMALL NUMBER IN PARLIAMENT BUT I HAVE ALWAYS SAID AND HAVE BEEN WARNING THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN FOR SOME TIME IT WAS VERY CLEAR AS I WENT ROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ARE AREAS OF OUR SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO HAD HAD SUPPORTED US IN THE PAST PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL SUPPORTING US BUT WE WERE NOT GOING TO ON THIS ISSUE
I THINK WHAT THERE IS THIS HUGE DISCONNECT IN LABOUR AREAS CERTAINLY AS FURTHER OUT OF LONDON YOU GET FROM THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP I I THOUGHT WE HAD ALL THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVES AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WAS IN THEIR PARTY I THINK A BIG DISCUSSIONS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A PARTY IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO WIN THESE PEOPLE BACK AND MADE PEOPLE WILL SAY THE ANSWER TO THAT IS JAMES THE LEADER
WELL I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK JEREMY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AT ALL AND IN JEREMY WAS WITH MYSELF AND OTHERS LIKE FRANK FIELDEN DIESEL ARE STUART AND ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE SAYING WE SHOULD BE LEAVING WE SHOULD BE HAPPY SUPPORTER RIGHT HE ACTUALLY YES OF COURSE BUT FOR THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HE'S BEEN VOTING IN THE SAME WAY AS I DID VERY MUCH AGAINST THE Y. YO HE BECAME LEADER OF THE PARTY AND I THINK HE FELT HE HAD TO KEEP THE PARTY TOGETHER IN THE WAY AT THE TOP LEVEL BUT I THINK WHAT I DOES HAPPEN IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE DIDN'T
TICKLEY WANT TO CAMPAIGN ON THIS ISSUE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN MY PARTY WHO WANT TO GET RID OF JEREMY WHATEVER HE HAD DONE SO I DON'T THINK THIS ITSELF WILL CHANGE THE SITUATION WAS THE LABOUR PARTY ABOUT ABOUT A LEADER BUT ON LEADER'S MEANT TO DO THAT AREN'T THEY MEANT TO LEAD AND IF THEY BELIEVE IN SOMETHING AREN'T THEY MEANT TO SAY NOT WITHSTANDING MUD PARTY THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE IN AND I WOULD TRY TO PERSUADE YOU TO FOLLOW ME AND IF YOU WON'T FOLLOW ME
OF THESE YES AND I THINK THAT THEY WERE PARTY SHOULD HAVE HAD I VERY MUCH CLEARER IF YOU LOSE THEY WERE QUITE HAPPY FOR PEOPLE TO BE CAMPAIGNING ON ON BOTH SIDES AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT JEREMY DIDN'T TAKE THAT VIEW AND OF COURSE THAT HE WAS UNDER HUGE PRESSURE FROM THERE FROM THE SHADOW CABINET WHO ARE ON THE WHOLE ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PRO E.U. WHEREAS OUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE I DON'T THEY AND THEN
OUTSIDE LONDON THERE IS THIS HUGE DIFFERENCE WHICH IT WAS IT HAS NOT BEEN REFLECTED BY OUR PARTY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT QUICK THOUGHT YOU WANT AN EARLY ELECTION I WANT TO SEE I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO SEE DAVID CAMERON LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE TO GET SOMEONE WHO REALLY GENUINELY IS COMMITTED EARLIER LIKE GETTING OUT I'VE NO IDEA BY THAT I THINK WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ONE OH I'M VERY HAPPY HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION ANY TIME BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT WOULD BE I THINK THE PURPOSE AT THE MOMENT SHOULD BE THAT WE SHOULD BE
GEORGE OSBORNE SHOULD BE HEAVILY CRITICISED FOR THE WAY HE HAS HANDLED THIS THE WAY HE IS SCARED THE MARKET SO WE'RE SEEING THE SITUATION IT'S HAPPENING TODAY BUT THAT WILL PASS NOW WHETHER HE WILL BE THERE TO SEE IT PASS I'M NOT SO SURE ALL RIGHT KATE HOEY THANKS A LOT TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN WILD SCOTLAND VOTED STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE RESULT WAS SIXTY THREE PERCENT IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT AGAINST SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM SARAH SMITH IS A SCOTLAND EDITOR AND JOINS US FROM EDINBURGH
AND BEFORE WE LOOK AT THAT LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE RESULTS FROM LAST NIGHT ALL THIRTY TWO COUNCIL AREAS IN SCOTLAND BACK TO REMAIN ABSOLUTELY IT COULDN'T BE A CLEARER RESULTS SAYING SCOTLAND ONCE THEIR STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BY A STRONG MAJORITY AND IN EVERY SINGLE REACHING THE TURNOUT WASN'T AS HIGH AS POSSIBLY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS MIGHT THINK THEY WERE CHEATED OF A FEW VOTES AS A RESULT BUT THE RESULT WAS VERY CLEAR
WHAT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT MEANS WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME COMMENTS FROM SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OR HIT THE SEEMING TO HINT AT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER REP INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND IT REALLY IS JUST A HINT LET ME EXPLAIN SOME OF THIS TEA THE SCENARIO THAT WE'RE IN WHERE THE U.K. IS VOTED TO LEAVE BUT SCOTLAND STRONGLY VOTED TO REMAIN IS EXACTLY WHAT NICOLA STURGEON WAS THINKING OF WHEN SHE TOLD US THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HOLD ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
IF THE COUNTRY IS TAKEN OUT OF THE E.U. AGAINST OUR WILL IN HER WORDS AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE REST OF THE U.K. COULDN'T BE MORE STARK NOW
BUT ALL SHE SAID SO FAR IS THAT THIS SHOWS THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SEE THEIR FUTURE AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SHE HAS NOT SAID THAT SHE'S GOING TO HOLD ANOTHER VAULT WILL HIRA SUBSTANTIAL STATEMENT FROM HER ABOUT MID MORNING I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF SHE DEFINITELY COMMITS HERSELF TO A SECOND REFERENDUM AT THIS POINT THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF PEOPLE LOTS OF INDEPENDENT SUPPORTERS WHO ASSUMED THAT THIS IS IT INDIA REF TOO AS IT'S CALLED IN SCOTLAND IS DEFINITELY ON
BUT NICOLA STURGEON IS A CAUTIOUS POLITICIAN AND SHE WILL NOT HOLD A REFERENDUM IF SHE THINKS THERE'S A CHANCE THAT SHE MIGHT LOSE IT BECAUSE NATIONALS NOW THEY REALLY ONLY HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE AT THIS IF THEY LOSE A SECOND REFERENDUM THEN THAT'S IT THEIR DREAM OF INDEPENDENCE REALLY WILL BE OVER AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THIS DEFINITELY MEANS THAT SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN IT OH KAY BICKER BUT BUT BUT THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WILL MOVE WHO WOULD'VE VOTED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THE LAST REFERENDUM WHO MAY NOW THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY
THERE WILL BE NOT LEAST BECAUSE DURING THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM SCOTS WERE TOLD IN UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U. YOU HAVE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE U.K. BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND WOULD GET TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE E.U. ANON WHAT TERMS SO THAT AND THE FACT THAT VOTES IN ENGLAND OUR FORCING SCOTS INTO A POSITION THAT THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR LEAVING THE E.U. THAT WILL IRRITATE AND INFURIATE PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY MAY NOW BE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
BUT ALL SORTS OF OTHER QUESTIONS COME UP YOU WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE CURRENCY ISSUE ALL OVER AGAIN VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE SCOTTISH NOW SINCE THE SAY THEY WOULD SHARE STERLING WITH THE REST OF THE U.K. IF ONE COUNTRY WILL BE INSIDE THE E.U. AND THE OTHER ONE OUT WHAT WITH THE TOWNS OF SCOTLAND'S ENTRY B. WITH THE B. A HARD BORDER BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND IT THROWS UP ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS WE DIDN'T DEBATE IN THE FIRST SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AND IT MEANS THE RESULT IS NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION
SARAH SMITH THANKS VERY MUCH THAT WAS SCOTLAND A VERY DIFFERENT RESULT IN WALES SHONE LLOYD'S A CORRESPONDENT IN CARDIFF EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LEAVES SEVEN HUNDRED ASSEMBLY REMAINED
YES THE SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY TWO LOCAL AUTHORITIES HERE IN WALES HAVE BACKED BRECHT'S IT AT THE TURNOUT WAS SEVENTY TWO PERCENT MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR STRONGHOLDS BACKING HER VOTE TO LEAVE INCLUDING METHOD TO DRILL TOLD VINE HAD FILLY AND LINE IT GWENT ARE ACTUALLY SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTE WANTED TO LEAVE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST MARGIN IN WALES
THOSE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE QUALIFIED FOR E.U. STRUCTURAL FUNDS OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS ALLOCATED TO PULL SOME OF EUROPE'S POOREST AREAS YOU TRAVEL TO THOSE TOWNS SEE NEW ROADS YOU SEE NEW SCHOOLS YOU SEE NEW HOSPITALS ALL BEARING THE EUROPEAN FLAG SAYING THAT FUNDING HAS COME FROM THERE BUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THEY HADN'T FELT THE BENEFIT AND MANY PEOPLE
IN THE SOUTH WALES VALLEYS WERE TALKING ABOUT CONCERNS OVER IMMIGRATION MORE AFFLUENT CARDIFF AND VALE OF GLAMORGAN VOTED TO STAY OR GWYNETH CEDDIE TO GO ON THE OTHER AREAS IN WALES DID BACK REMAIN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT REACTION THIS MORNING WE'RE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM THE FIRST MINISTER CAROLINE JONES LATER IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS LORD HAIN WHO LED A WELSH LABOUR'S REMAIN CAMPAIGN HERE
WELL HE'S SAYING THAT THE CONSERVATIVE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAD INVITED A KICKING IN THE REFERENDUM AND ARE BEING GIVEN IT HOWEVER THE LEADER OF THE WELSH CONSERVATIVES IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND LEAVE SUPPORT ANDREW DAVIES HE SAID THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT FOR WALES AND AT UKIP'S LEADER IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HERE IN CARDIFF NEIL HAMILTON WELL HE SAID HE'S DELIGHTED EVEN A LITTLE SURPRISED SO HOW DOES IT CHANGE POLITICS IN WALES
I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT MOST OF US ARE GOING TO BE ASKING THIS MORNING THE LABOUR HEARTLANDS WHERE
PEOPLE EXPECTED POTENTIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THEIR POSSIBLY TO BE A VOTE TO REMAINED THEY REALLY HAVE RETURNED THAT LEAVE THEIR VOTE SO THAT'S THE QUESTION FOR CARWYN JONES HERE THE LABOUR LEADER AND THE LEADER OF THE ASSEMBLY HERE THE FIRST MINISTER HERE IN WELLS A LEADER OF THE WELSH GOVERNMENT THERE'S THE QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING TO HIM AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE LATER
MANY THANKS IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN WELL LET'S GO TO NORTHERN IRELAND CHRIS PAGE A NORTHERN IRELAND CORRESPONDENT AND CHRIS THE VOTE THERE TO REMAIN BY FIFTY FIVE POINT EIGHT PER CENT IN IT THROWS UP ALL SORTS OF CONCERNS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND DOESN'T IT
WELL THAT'S RIGHT WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THIS RESULT IS THAT IT BREAKS DOWN REALLY ALONG THE CLASSIC UNIONIST NATIONALIST LINES THE ALLIES IN TERMS OF PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCIES NEARLY ALL THE CONSTITUENCIES IN WHICH THE M.P. AS A UNIONIST VOTE HAD TO LEAVE THE LIVING UNIONIST PARTY HERE THE BIGGEST PARTY MY ASSEMBLY THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONISTS HAD CAMPION VIGOROUSLY ON THE OUTSIDE BUT ALL THE CONSTITUENCIES WHERE THE M.P. IS A NATIONALIST VOTED TO REMAIN
THE MARGIN OF VICTORY FOR THE REMAIN PRETTY LEAVE CAMPION HERE FOR THE RIMMING CAMPION HERE I'M SORRY IT WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN REMAIN COMPUTERS HAD EXPECTED LEADING CAMPAIGNERS FOR REMAIN HERE HAD THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE PERHAPS TWO THIRDS IN THEIR FAVOUR IN REALITY IT'S BEEN FIFTY SIX PERCENT TURNOUT IN NATIONALIST AREAS RELATIVELY LITTLE COMPARED WITH UNIONIST AREAS SO IT APPEARS TO BE THE KISS FOR THEM INSIDE AND FOR THE NATIONALIST PARTIES HERE THEY QUITE SIMPLY DIDN'T GET THE BOWL TIGHT
OH K. BUT WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE OF COURSE UNITED KINGDOM NOW WILL BE LEAVING AND WE'VE HAD THE REMARKABLE COMMENTS FROM SINN FEIN CALLING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A REFERENDUM ON A UNITED IRELAND
THAT'S RIGHT IT ALWAYS LOOKED AT THIS REFERENDUM PRE MUST NOT A WHAT THE RESULT WAS IN FACT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THEIR UNITED IRELAND ARGUMENT IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS NAE AS EXPECTED SINN FEIN HAVE SAID THAT'S GIVEN THAT THE RESULT IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS A ROMANIAN BUT THE RESULT ACROSS THE U.K. IS A LEAVE WELL THEN THERE SHOULD BE A REFERENDUM ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND SINCE THE INTERNATIONAL CHAIRPERSON DECLAN KENNY HAS TALKED ABOUT ENGLISH FOOD WAS DRAGGING PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND I'D HAVE IT AGAINST THEIR WILL
NOW THE STATUS UNDER THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT IS THAT A REFERENDUM ON THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND CAN ONLY BE CALLED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT MAJORITY MAY VOTE IN FAVOUR OF NORTHERN IRELAND JOINING UP WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARIES OR VILLAS OF COURSE LEADING AISHA HAS SAID THAT THE EVIDENCE AT THE MOMENT IS THE OPERA SAID THAT ALL THE VOTING PATTERN SUGGESTIVE STILL A STRONG MAJORITY HERE IN FAVOUR OF NORTHERN IRELAND REMAINING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM
SO IS THERE GOING TO BE A BORDER PULL ANY TIME SOON I THINK THAT'S UNLIKELY BUT I DO THINK THIS RESULT WILL DO WILL BE TO CHANGE THE DEBATE AROUND THE UNITED AL ADDITION PERHAPS BRING IT ON TO THE EDGE AND IN A WAY IT HASN'T BEEN FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS CHRIS PAGE THANKS VERY MUCH TWELVE MINISTER SAID ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN AN HISTORIC MOVE THAT HAS STUNNED THE REST OF THE CONTINENT AND SENT THE POUND WHO HISTORIC GLOBE ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
IT IS AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING A HISTORIC MOMENT WE HAVE WOKEN UP SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTING IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HOW DO PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT WHAT THEY VOTED FOR YESTERDAY A REPORTER SEEM A GOOD TEXTURE IS GATHERING REACTION OUTSIDE KING'S CROSS RAILWAY STATION IN LONDON THIS MORNING SEEMA WHAT HAVE PEOPLE BEEN SAYING TO YOU
SARAH HAVE ACTUALLY GALT NICK LIKES WITH ME HE IS FROM LONDON HE'S JUST ABOUT TO GET ON A TRAIN TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE RESULT IS YET SO I'M JUST ABOUT TO TELL HIM LIVE ON AIR WE'RE GOING TO GET HIS REACTION SO NICK THE U.K. HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. YOUR FIRST REACTIONS
SHOCKED THAT THAT'LL BE THE FIRST WORDS SHOCKED SURPRISED BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT CHECKING SOCIAL MEDIA THE FIRST EDITIONS OF THE NEWSPAPERS THE TIMES THE SUN AND SO ON I THINK THE MIRROR OR REPORTED
LOST FOR FOR HOURS THAT THE U.K. HAD VOTED TO REMAIN SO TO WAKE UP AND COME HERE TODAY FIND OUT YOU'VE JUST HELPING OUT THAT'S A REAL SHOCK HOW DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE PANNING OUT
IMMEDIATELY I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY UNCERTAIN I I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY BUT I CAN'T
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT ANYBODY FORESAW THIS THIS HAPPENING I SUPPOSE IT'S GOING TO AFFECT OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES IN WAYS THAT WE PROBABLY COULDN'T IMAGINE RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S A CASE OF JOINING NON E.U. PASSPORT LINES AIRPORTS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A WHILE TO RIPPLE DOWN
RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S JUST QUITE A LOT TO TAKE IN ANNA IS WITH YOU YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE NEWS
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION YEAH MUCH SAME AS NICK TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T EXPECT IT I CAN'T DISAPPOINTED I THINK THAT'S THE WORD I THINK
AGAIN WHEN I WENT TO BED I WAS EXPECTING CUSTER TO REMAIN I WANTED US TO ME AND I VOTED TO REMAIN AND I KIND OF I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS NOW IT'S QUITE UNCERTAIN AND QUITE WORRYING ACTUALLY
O.K. THANK YOU WELL THAT'S NICK LIGHTFOOT AND THESE HERE AT KING'S CROSS STATION BACK TO YOU GREG
IT IS TEN TO SEVEN WERE EXPECTING DAVID CAMERON TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FROM TEN DOWNING STREET AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT PROBABLY WE THINK BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MEANTIME AT A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION INEVITABLY ANDREA LEAD SOME IS THE ENERGY MINISTER VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER WHAT SHOULD HE
HELLO OH WELL PERHAPS SHE ISN'T THERE YES YOU ARE GOOD YOU CAN HEAR ME CAN YOU HEAR ME
WELL I KNOW THAT SHE WAS THERE BUT I DON'T THINK SHE CAN HEAR US SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO TO SOMETHING ELSE WELL WE TRIED TO MAKE CONTACT IT ONE MORE TRY
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT IS IN THE PAPERS THEN THE VICTORY FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN CAME TOO LATE FOR THE PAPERS BUT REACTION ON THEIR WEBSITES WAS SWIFT WE'RE ON OUR WAY OUT THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES VOTERS IN NORTHERN ENGLAND DEFIED LABOUR'S ELITE AND GAVE TWO FINGERS TO BRUSSELS PRESSURE IS NOW BEING HEAPED ON DAVID CAMERON AND THE GOVERNMENT WITH LEADING POLITICIAN SAYING HE WILL NOT SURVIVE AS PRIME MINISTER THE PEOPLE ADDS THE MALE ANNOUNCES IT WRECKS IT EXPRESS DESCRIBED IT
A TRIUMPHANT RESULT THE MIRROR SAYS THE RESULTS REVEALS THE BROKEN STATE OF THE U.K. WITH WALES' MOST OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND MUCH OF THE MIDLANDS GOING FOR BRECHT'S IT FOR TIM STANLEY ON THE TELEGRAPHS WEBSITE THIS WAS THE DAY THE BRITISH PEOPLE DEFIED THEIR JAILERS HE SAYS THEY WERE TOO REFERENDUMS YESTERDAY THE FIRST WAS A MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE SECOND WAS ON THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT LEAVE ONE BOAT
JAMES COOK UP AND I'VE GOT A BITCH COMMENTATOR SAYS DAVID CAMERON IS FINISHED HE'S HEADING FOR A PLACE IN HISTORY AS THE PRIME MINISTER WHO GAMBLED WITH BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HIS OWN CAREER AND LOST THE COUNTRY HAS REJECTED HIS CASE ON THE BIGGEST DECISION OF THE U.K. HAS TAKEN IN A GENERATION THE ONLY QUESTION LEFT IS HOW LONG HE WAS ON IN THE JOB AND THAT HE BELIEVES WILL BE DECIDED NOT BY HIM BUT BY HIS OPPONENTS WITHIN HIS PARTY
THE GUARDIAN SAYS BRITAIN'S SELF REJECTION FROM EUROPE IS THE COMBINATION NOT JUST HER FOUR MONTHS OF HEADY CAMPAIGNING BUT FOUR DECADES OF LATENT EURO SCEPTICISM WHICH THROUGH GOOD TIMES AND BAD NEVER REALLY WENT AWAY ELSEWHERE THE PAPERS PAPERS COMMENTATOR RAFAEL BEAR SAYS THE BRAKES IT EARTHQUAKE AS HAPPENED AND THE RUBBLE WILL TAKE YEARS TO CLEAR I'LL CONTINENT IS LOOKING ON IN TREPIDATION HE SAYS EUROPE CANNOT BE THE SAME AGAIN
BROUGHT LEADING ARTICLE IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES SAYS BRITISH VOTERS HAVE WILFULLY WALKED OFF A CLIFF BY DECIDING TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE BRICKS IT VICTORY AS A DEFEAT FOR BRITAIN EUROPE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
BECAUSE ON TENS OF MILLIONS OF BRITONS VOTED FOR ISOLATION TO GO IT ALONE RATHER THAN FOR CO OPERATION EUROPE'S UNIFIED STANCE AGAINST ARE RE EMERGING AND AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA WILL BE SPLINTERED AND LIBERACE OR IN FRANCE SAYS THE DECISION WILL BE A PAINFUL ONE FOR BRITAIN AND ITS ECONOMY WILL SUFFER NEW YORK TIMES SAYS THE RESULT AS A HISTORIC DECISION SURE TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD RATTLE EUROPE AND ROCK POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WEST
GULF NEWS IN THE U.S.A. E. DESCRIBED IT AS A STUNNING POLITICAL BLOW TO DAVID CAMERON AND SEES ME BLOW TO THE FUTURE OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ITSELF AND LET US SEE IF WE CAN MAKE CONTACT WITH ANDREA LEAD SOME GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING A GOOD YOU'RE EXCELLENT WE KNOW THAT ME THINK MISTER CAMERON IS GOING TO APPEAR BEFORE THE CAMERAS WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO WATCH IT
I THINK HE SHOULD SAY THAT HE HAS HEARD WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE INSTRUCTED AND THAT HE WILL CARRY OUT THEIR WISHES I CERTAINLY HOPE AND EXPECT THAT HE WILL REMAIN PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY AND AND THEN WHAT WE NEED IS A PERIOD OF CALM
CALCULATION ON HOW BEST TO AN ACTOR THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PEOPLE YOU SAY YOU WANT HIM TO STAY ON AS PRIME MINISTER BUT SURELY THE IDEA OF A RE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NEGOTIATIONS TO LEAVE IN THIS CASE OF COURSE NOT THE RENEGOTIATION ON NEGOTIATIONS LEAD SHOULD BE LED BY A MAN WHO TRIED AND FAILED TO GET US TO STAY IN
WELL I THINK BEING PRIME MINISTER YOU DON'T ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE NEGOTIATIONS YOU TAKE PART UP IN A DIPLOMATIC SENSE BUT HE WILL OBVIOUSLY NEED A TEAM OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NO DOUBT THAT WOULD INCLUDE SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG ON THE LEAD SIDE BUT I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER DID AN AMAZING THING
GIVING US THIS REFERENDUM AND IN PARTICULAR THEY'RE NOT JUST ALLOWING US BUT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING US ALL AS M.P.S AND EVEN HIS MINISTERS TO GO WITH WHAT OUR HEARTS TOLD US HE'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SHOCKING ERROR OF JUDGEMENT DIDN'T IT WHAT WHAT DID HIS DECISION TO HOLD THE ART AT THE TIME HE DID WITH THE RENEGOTIATION THAT HE HAD
TRIED TO ACHIEVE THAT BUT IT'S NOT OH SHOCKING AIR OF JUDGEMENT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION I THINK IT WAS A GOOD VOTE YOUR WAY WELL DONE HOW DO YOU KNOW THEN YOU THEN YOU'D NEVER ALLOW ANYONE ANYTHING I DID YOU JUST LOCK PEOPLE UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS THAT CERTAIN THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN THE CONSTITUTION DIDN'T DEMAND THAT THE REVEREND ABOUT DABBLE BUT THE PRIME MINISTER FELT THAT IT HAD BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME
A PROMISE THAT HAD BEEN MADE THROUGH VARIOUS PARLIAMENTS THAT THEY WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION VERY CLEARLY AT ANY LEVEL WHAT WE ARE NOW EATING IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE VOTED ON IT IN THE VERY FIRST REFERENDUM BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SO HE FELT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR DOING THE RIGHT WRONG BECAUSE HE'S A MAN OF PRINCIPLE WELL THERE WE ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR CONSERVATIVE M.P. SIDE LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER TELLING HIM HE HAS A DUTY TO STAY ON ONE OF THEM ANDREA JENKINS CONSERVATIVE M.P. BACK LEAVE ELECTED LOT JUST LAST YEAR SHE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING A DUTY TO STAY ON MANY PEOPLE OF COURSE WOULD SAY HE HAS A DUTY TO GO
YOUR BOAT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT DAVID CAMERON CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS REFERENDUM THE CHOICE FOR THIS
PUBLIC TO MAKE THIS DECISION IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM AND I'M PROUD OF THIS IT'S CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER WHO BELIEVES IN THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AND THEY'VE MADE THEIR CHOICE AND LET'S GET ON WITH IT IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL NOW ALTHOUGH THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT JOB FOR THE GOVERNMENT NOW IS TO MICK RENEGOTIATE OR NEGOTIATE OUR EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HE BELIEVES SHOULD HAPPEN
NO BUT I THINK IT'S AT THE END OF THE DAY HE DID BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC ALWAYS SAID ALL ALONG THAT THE PUBLIC WILL DECIDE AND THEY'VE DECIDED HE GAVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY BY OFFERING THE REFERENDUM AND I THINK HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO BUY A SIGNED LETTER WE'RE GOING FOR A PERIOD OF CHOPPY WATERS AT THE MOMENT AND SAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE STABILITY
HE'S BEEN OUR P.M. NOW FOR SIX YEARS HE'S BEEN ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND I THINK HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD THROUGH INTO A PERIOD OF CALM WATERS IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO TRUST HIM DO YOU TRUST HIM TO GET THE MEGA NEGOTIATION WITH THE EXIT THAT I AND THE FAVOURABLE TERMS HAVE RENEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU WANT I COMPLETELY AGREE WHAT WITH WHAT ANDY SAID ACTUALLY AS A FELL EMBRACED AS WELL IS ABOUT HAVING
A STRONG TEAM AROUND YOU WITH WHICH BOTH THROUGH IT IS SIR REMAIN SIDE EXETER'S TOGETHER IN A PARTY AND OUR GOVERNMENT AND WORKED TOGETHER ON THIS AND THE THING IS WE'RE NOT GOING TO MESS WITH EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS THAT THE PARTY WAS WE'RE NOT GOING TO MESS THIS IS A TIME TO REALLY MAKE BRITAIN SHINE AND WHAT I THINK PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT YOU THIS IS HAIR AND HISTORIC MOMENTS I'M ABSOLUTELY ECSTATIC AT THE BRITISH
PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN TO LEAVE AND TAKE BACK CONTROL AND WE'RE NOW BEGIN THE PROCESS OF LIBERATING OUR COUNTRY AND BE FREE FROM THE SHACKLES OF BRISTLES AND SHARON KEPT COS IN THE WILD WHY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS COS THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT TODAY THERE IS WE SO FAR YOU LOOK AT WHO HAS BEEN
SPEAKING PUBLICLY ABOUT BRECK'S IT THE FACE OF BRECK'S IT HAS BEEN NIGEL FAHRT AAGE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM EITHER MICHAEL GO FOR BORIS JOHNSON DO YOU THINK THEY NEED TO SAY SOMETHING SOON
THAT'S UP TO THEM THERE MIGHT BE EVEN THIS MEANT HAVING A CELEBRATION PARTIES SO NO DOUBT YOU'LL HEAR FROM FROM THE KEY PEOPLE IN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS A DAY PROGRESSES ANDRA JENKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
A QUICK WEATHER FORECAST SARAH WE'VE GOT A FRESHER DAY AHEAD TODAY JOHN LESS HUMID THAN RECENT DAYS AND IT'LL BE A MIX OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FOR THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND LESS IN THE WAY OF HEAVY SHOWERS THAN WE'VE SEEN OVER RECENT DAYS
SO MANY DRY FOR THE SOUTH EAST AND EASTERN ENGLAND WITH SOME SUNSHINE AROUND AND HIGHS UP TO AROUND TWENTY TWO DEGREES SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS AND NORTHERN ENGLAND LOOKING LARGELY DRY FIRST THING BUT WE WILL SEE SHOWERS DEVELOPING LATER IN THE DAY SOME OF THEM ON THE HEAVY SIDE ACROSS WALES AND NORTHERN ENGLAND TOO
SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND WILL HAVE A DAY OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS A CHANCE THOSE SHOWERS COULD BRING SOME HAIL AND THUNDER AND LIGHTNING DURING THE AFTERNOON THAT LIGHT WINDS IN BETWEEN THE SHOWERS AND HIGHS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY AROUND ABOUT SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWO DEGREES
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN AN HISTORIC MOVE THAT HAS STUNNED THE REST OF THE CONTINENT AND SEND THE POUND PLUNGING ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND LEAVE CAMPAIGNER JACOB REES MOGG SAID THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN GIVEN THE CHANCE TO SPEAK
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN BASICALLY AN INSURGENT CAMPAIGN IT HAS BEEN A CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS A FIELD
THAT THE RULERS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOT OUT OF TOUCH WITH THOSE WHO ELECT THEM
THE GREEN PARTY M.P. CAROLINE LUCAS WHO IS A REMAIN CAMPAIGNER SAID SHE WAS SADDENED BY THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM I THINK THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING RESULT PERSONALLY I FEEL PRETTY HEARTBROKEN I THINK IT HAS REVEALED MASSIVE DIVISIONS WITHIN A COUNTRY
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS IN CONTACT WITH LEADING BANKS TO TRY TO CALM THE TURMOIL DOZENS OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE SIGNED A LETTER SAYING DAVID CAMERON HAS A DUTY TO STAY ON AS PRIME MINISTER SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER HAS HAD SCOTTISH VOTERS SEE THEIR FUTURE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION DAYS NEWSREADER
HIS ABSENCE AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS BRITAIN IS TO END ITS MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH VIRTUALLY ALL THE VOTES COUNTED IN THE REFERENDUM MORE THAN SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE MADE THE MOMENTOUS DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLION SAID THEY WANTED TO REMAIN
TURNOUT WAS SEVENTY TWO PER CENT THAT'S LEVEL IN A NATIONWIDE BALLOT IN THE U.K. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO SHORTLY AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED AT TEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT TO NEW OPINION POLL SUGGESTED A NARROW VICTORY FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AREN'T IN THE HOURS THAT FOLLOWED RESULTS IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND PROMPTED A SWIFT CHANGE IN THE MOOD OR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
ALL NIGHT THE CONFIDENCE AMONG THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN STEADILY BUILDING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN WAS FIFTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF LEAF WAS EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND
EARLY RESULTS FROM SUNDERLAND SIXTY ONE PERCENT IN FAVOUR OF LEAVE SET THE PATTERN FOR THE NIGHT WITH MANY TRADITIONAL LABOUR AREAS OPTING DECISIVELY FOR BRECHT IT IN BARNSLEY IT WAS SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT SOUTH TYNESIDE SIXTY ONE PER CENT AND HARTLEPOOL SEVENTY PER CENT AND IN THOSE BIG METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE REMAIN HAD HOPED TO DO WELL THE MARGIN OF THEIR VICTORY WAS MUCH LESS THAN EXPECTED IN NEWCASTLE AND SHEFFIELD THEY WON BY JUST FIFTY ONE PER CENT THE CITY OF DURHAM
WHICH MANY ELECTION EXPERTS REGARDED AS A BELLWETHER RESULT WENT FIRMLY FOR LEAVE BY FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT AND IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL BARRAGE WAS ALREADY SENSING VICTORY BUT DAWN IS BREAKING ALL OF HIM THAT THEN DON'T YOU KNOW
IF THE PREDICTIONS NOW ARE RIGHT THIS WILL BE A VICTORY FOR REAL PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR DECENT
THE ONLY TWO LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO BUCK THIS TREND WILL LONDON AND SCOTLAND IN LONDON THERE WERE AS EXPECTED HUGE WINS FOR REMAIN LAMBETH SEVENTY NINE PER CENT ONES WORTH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND ISLINGTON SEVENTY PER CENT BUT IN WALES SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY TWO AREAS VOTED TO LEAVE THEIR RESULTS ARE CERTAIN TO PROMPT AN ANXIOUS DEBATE IN LABOUR RANKS THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL THERE IS A DISAFFECTED VOTE
AND DISAFFECTED WITH POLITICS OVERALL DISAFFECTED WITH WESTMINSTER PARTIES IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THAT IS A LABOUR SUPPORTERS TOO LONG WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO TRY AND TURN THAT ROUND IT'S BEEN TOUGH AND THAT IS PETER IF IT GETS HER FEEL LIKE A BY ELECTION AT THE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE'S GRIEVANCES OR BIN
AND AS WELL AS A RESULT OF THIS VOTE IN TORY CIRCLES THE RESULT WILL COME AS A HAMMER BLOW TO MISTER CAMERON BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO LAST NIGHT SIGNED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HOWEVER ONE LEADING BREAKS IT FIGURED THIS MORNING SUGGESTED THAT WHILE MISTER CAMERON COULD STAY FOR A BIT GEORGE OSBORNE WOULD HAVE TO GO
PRETTY MUCH STRAIGHTAWAY THE RESULT OPENS A NEW CHAPTER IN BRITAIN'S HISTORY FORTY YEARS AFTER THE BRITISH ELECTORATE VOTED DECISIVELY TO JOIN WHAT WAS THEN THE COMMON MARKET BRITAIN HAS NOW DECIDED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
SCOTLAND VOTED EMPHATICALLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. WITH ALL THIRTY TWO LOCAL AUTHORITY AREAS BACKING REMAIN THE RESULT LED ONE S.N.P. MINISTER TO SAY A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE WOULD NOW BE AN OPTION I'LL SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLAINE REPORTS
IN SCOTLAND EVERY SINGLE RESULT WAS IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH THE FINAL SCOTTISH OUTCOME SIXTY TWO PERCENT TO THIRTY EIGHT AN EDINBURGH NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF VOTERS BACK STAYING IN EUROPE AND GLASGOW SUPPORT FOR REMAIN WAS TWO TO ONE
ONLY IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY OF MUDDY DID THE LEAF CAMPAIGN COME CLOSE WAS REMAINED JUST ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN VOTES AHEAD
THE U.K. DECISION TO LEAVE BRINGS WORTH IT RENEWED PRESSURE IN SCOTLAND FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY PROMISED IN ITS ELECTION MANIFESTO EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT IF SCOTLAND WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE E.U. THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HOLD ANOTHER REFERENDUM
THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON SAID THIS MORNING IT WAS CLEAR THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SAW THEIR FUTURE AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION STRONG SUPPORT FOR BREAKS IT IN WALES INCLUDING IN SWANSEA WEATHER REMAIN CAMP HAD EXPECTED TO PERFORM WELL THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRAP IS THE M.P. FOR PER SELLING IN PEMBROKESHIRE SAID THERE WAS WIDESPREAD DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE E.U.
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE SOUTH WALES VALLEYS AND ALSO IN SOME OF THE NORTH WALES LABOUR SEATS IS THE SAME PHENOMENON YOU'RE SEEING IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND IN SOME OF THE OTHER OLD INDUSTRIAL WHITE WORKING CLASS AREAS OF ENGLAND A LARGE NUMBER OF VOTERS SAYING SORRY WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THE LABOUR PARTY
ALL THE GOVERNMENT IN THE WAY THEY TELL US THAT EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION
IT'S GOOD FOR US THE VALUE OF STERLING TUMBLED THROUGH THE NIGHT AND HAS NOW FALLEN TO A THIRTY YEAR LOW AGAINST THE DOLLAR IS BEING REPORTED AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS IN CONTACT WITH THE BANKS BEFORE THE MARKETS OPEN THE RATINGS AGENCY STANDARD AND PAUSE AS ALREADY WARNED THAT THE U.K. IS LIKELY TO LOSE ITS TRIPLE A. CREDIT RATING MORE DETAILS FROM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ON AHMED
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT LEAVE WAS HEADING FOR VICTORY THE POUND AND GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS TOOK THE BRUNT OF INVESTORS FEARS STERLING FELL IN VALUE AGAINST THE DOLLAR TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE IN DRAMATIC OVERNIGHT MARKET THE CURRENCY SWAN WILDLY WITH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY CRATER AT DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND BLACK WEDNESDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN THE POUND FELL OUT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM
STIRLING HIT A RECORD HIGH FOR THE YEAR SHORTLY AFTER THE POLLS CLOSE LAST NIGHT WHEN REMAIN APPEAR TO HAVE PERFORMED STRONGLY IT THEN FELL SHARPLY
STOCK MARKETS WERE ALSO JITTERY THE JAPANESE MCCAY WAS DOWN NEARLY EIGHT PER CENT OVERNIGHT AND FOOTSIE FUTURES WHICH PRECEDES THE OPENING OF THE LONDON MARKET WAS DOWN SEVEN PERCENT
BANK STOCKS TRADED IN ASIA INCLUDING AGERS B. C. WERE ALSO HIT FALLING BY ALSO OVER SEVEN PERCENT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS SET TO MAKE A STATEMENT THIS MORNING TO REASSURE MARKETS THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN FINANCIAL STABILITY BY THE PROVISION OF SUPPORT FOR BANKS
ANY DECISION ON INTEREST RATES IS LIKELY TO BE DELAYED UNTIL THE DIRECTION OF THE ECONOMY BECOMES CLEARER AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS JUST MADE THIS STATEMENT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY IT HAS UNDERTAKEN EXTENSIVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH H.M. TREASURY OTHER DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES AND OVERSEAS CENTRAL BANKS THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONETARY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY
WITH LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SUGGESTING THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE AUTUMN MA POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG CONSIDERS WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THE PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST COLLEAGUES USED TO SAY HE WAS A LUCKY POLITICIAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS CAREER HIS LUCK HAS DRAMATICALLY RUN OUT IN A SNUB TO HIM A SNUB TO THE STATUS QUO HAD A SNUB TO THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT BRITAIN HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TEAR UP THE SETTLEMENT THE COUNTRY'S HAD FOR DECADES UNLEASHING PERHAPS HUGE OPPORTUNITY OR PERHAPS HUGE RISK PERHAPS BOTH
THE COUNTRY'S DECISION CHANGES ALMOST EVERYTHING ALL THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN THE BRITISH MOTORIST TEND TO VOTE FOR WHAT THE CONSENSUS TELLS THEM HE'S THEIR ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST AND THAT REFERENDA THOSE VOTES WHERE THERE WAS ONLY BLACK AND WHITE NO SHADES OF GREY TEND TO PRODUCE THE STATUS QUO
AND IT COULD NOW SHATTERED THE PRIME MINISTER'S CAREER DESPITE PUBLIC PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY LETTERS FROM LOYALISTS PROMISES OF SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER'S TIME IN OFFICE MAY WELL BE CURTAILED THE TENSION CAN HE STAY IN OFFICE WITH HIS AUTHORITY DRAINED BY A DEFEAT OR WILKIE ENDEAVOUR TO STAY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE STABILITY AT A TIME MULCH OF THIS CHANGE
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT MARTINE SHALL SAID HE EXPECTED NEGOTIATIONS OVER BRITAIN'S DEPARTURE TO BEGIN QUICKLY GERMANY'S FOREIGN MINISTER FRIEND VOLTAR STEIN MAYER SAID IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR EUROPE AND GREAT BRITAIN THE FRENCH FAR RIGHT LEAVE HIM OR IN THE PEN CALLED FOR AN E.U. REFERENDUM IN FRANCE A DEMAND ECHOED BY THE DUTCH ANTI IMMIGRANT LEADER HERE BUILDERS A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE EXPLAINS THE PROCESS OF HOW BRITAIN WILL LEAVE THE E.U.
WE MAY HAVE VOTED FOR BRECHT'S IT BUT THE U.K. WON'T ACTUALLY LEAVE THE E.U. FOR SOME TIME THE RULES ARE LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE FIFTY OF THE LISBON TREATY THIS SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO NOTIFY THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL FORMALLY THE BRITAIN INTENDS TO LEAVE
THAT WOULD TRIGGER A TWO YEAR PERIOD DURING WHICH THE U.K. WOULD NEGOTIATE ITS WITHDRAWAL SORTING OUT THINGS LIKE HALF USED BUDGETS AND THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS LIVING IN THE U.K. THE TWO YEARS COULD BE EXTENDED BUT ONLY WITH THE SUPPORT OF ALL E.U. COUNTRIES
THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WIN THIS ARTICLE FIFTY PROCESS SHOULD BEGIN DURING THE CAMPAIGN DAVID CAMERON SAID SOON PRO LEAVE MINISTERS SAID IT WOULD BE WRONG TO RUSH
THEY'VE ALSO SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE IMMEDIATE CHANGES BEFORE THE U.K. ACTUALLY LEAVES THE E.U. SUCH AS CURBING THE POWER OF E. U. JUDGES AND LIMITING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF WORKERS POTENTIALLY IN BREACH OF THE U.K.'S TREATY OBLIGATIONS
THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO HAVE TO NEGOTIATE ITS FUTURE TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. AND FIXED TRADE DEALS WITH NON E.U. COUNTRIES
IN WHITEHALL AND WESTMINSTER WILL NOW BEGIN THE MASSIVE TASK OF STITCHING THE U.K. FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF E.U. LAW DECIDING WHICH DIRECTIVES AND REGULATIONS TO KEEP HER OR DITCH SO BRITAIN MAY HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE BUT IT'LL BE SOME YEARS BEFORE WE SAY GOODBYE
JAMES LANDALE REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON AS JAMES SAID THE COUNTRY WAKING UP TO THE NEWS THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ALL OF THE RESULTS ARE NOW IN JUST UNDER FIFTY TWO PERCENT WENT FOR LEAVE WITH JUST OVER FORTY EIGHT PER CENT GOING FOR REMAIN ONE THE MAN WHO KNOWS ABOUT HOW WE ALL VOTED PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH PONY COUNCIL WHO HAS
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT WATCHING THE RESULTS COME IN AND JOHN WHAT THEY SEEM TO SHOW HE'S A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY DIVIDED COUNTRY GEOGRAPHICALLY I DIVIDED COUNTRY BUT IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND OF ITS POPULATION SO WE SEEN SCOTLAND OBVIOUSLY NORTHERN IRELAND VOTE TO REMAIN INSIDE
THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THEIR VOTES HAVE BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE VOTES OF ENGLAND I'D HAVE WALES AND INDEED WITHIN ENGLAND LONDON WHICH VOTED VERY STRONGLY TREMAINE HAS FOUND THAT IT'S SITUATED IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE PROVINCES SEALIFE VERY DIFFERENTLY OR BIG EDUCATIONAL DIVIDE I WILL BE NEW FROM THE OPINION POLLS THAT GRADUATES
KEY NOT REMAIN INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMFORTABLE WITH IMMIGRATION THEY DON'T FEEL IT'S A CHALLENGE AND THEY'RE CAPABLE OF SURVIVING IN THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR MARKET VERSES THOSE WITH MUCH LESS EDUCATION WHO FIND IMMIGRATION ARE MUCH BIGGER CULTURAL CHALLENGE I DO JUST FRANKLY DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THEY PROFIT FROM THIS PROCESS OF GLOBALISATION THAT IS APPARENTLY MAKING A SWITCH I KNEW SEE A VERY SHOCKED WAS ABOUT A TWENTY POINT DIFFERENCE
IN THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR RELEVE REMAIN IN THOSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBERS OF GRUDGES PLACE LIKE OXFORD CAMBRIDGE AND EDINBURGH AND THOSE WITH RELATIVELY FEW PLACES LIKE BOSTON AND CLACTON THANK YOU BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL FINAL RESULT FIFTY ONE POINT NINE PERCENT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAJORITY HAD ONLY JUST IS IT ENOUGH OF A MANDATE FOR THE SCALE OF CHANGE THAT'S ABOUT
I THINK THE TRUTH IS THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE COUNTRY A REFERENDUM AS MANY AS SEVENTY TWO PERCENT PEOPLE TURNED OUT TO VOTE THIS MAKES IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION ANY U.K. WIDE BY THAT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO I THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE BY THE RULE THAT HE SET HIMSELF AS INDEED IS THE REST OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHAT OF COURSE IS TREAT SIMPLY UNDERLINES THE POINT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE DIVIDED PRETTY MUCH FIFTY FIFTY THAT INDEED THIS IS A
SIRIUS DIVISION HALF THE COUNTRY TAKES ONE VIEW
HALF THE COUNTRY TAKES THE OTHER VIEW AND THE CHALLENGE NOW FACING WHOEVER IS THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER ASSUMING THAT DAVID CAMERON IS NOT WITH US FOR THAT LONG WILL INDEED BE TO TRY TO BRING TOGETHER THESE TWO PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND INDEED ALSO TO BRING TOGETHER EH CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT'S THE MOMENT IS SERIOUSLY DIVIDED I DEPART WHOM ONE OF THE QUESTION MARKS WILL BE ASKED IN THE COMING WEEKS IS CUT IT COME TOGETHER ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY SUSTAIN A GOVERNMENT AND AN ABLE THEIR PRIME MINISTER TO COMMAND THE CONFIDENCE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
JOHN CURTIS PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A NEW DAWN IS BREAKING FOR AN INDEPENDENT UNITED KINGDOM THAT IS WHAT THE LEADER OF UKIP NIGEL THOROUGH I'D SAID A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AND HE'S ON THE LINE NO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW WE RECOGNISE IT
WERE RECOGNISED I HOPE BY HAVING IT AS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY THE DAY WE BATORY OH ABSOLUTELY WENSLEY ME OTHERS NATIONAL HOLIDAY WHAT THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE INDEPENDENCE STAYS WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE IS WE VOTED TO BECOME HUNDRED EIGHTY FOURTH WE HAVE BROKEN FREE FROM A FAILING POLITICAL UNION WE HAVE MANAGED THE THE LITTLE PEOPLE THE ORDINARY PEOPLE HAVE IGNORED ALL THE THREATS THAT HAVE COME FROM BIG BUSINESS AND BIG POLITICS AND IT'S BEEN A HUGE
AMAZING EXERCISE IN DEMOCRACY AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT NEXT WELL THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS COMMITTED TO BRECHT'S IT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY SO GET RID OF DAVID CAMERON HE SHOULD RESIGN
WELL I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO STAY ON AS PRIME MINISTER GIVEN THAT HE INVOLVED HIMSELF SO HEAVILY IN THE CAMPAIGN TOLD US THAT DREADFUL THINGS WOULD HAPPEN TO US IF WE WERE TO LEAVE RECESSION OR THREATS OF WAR AND ALL THE REST OF IT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT HE COULD BECOME A BRECHT'S IT PRIME MINISTER I MIGHT BE WRONG BUT I DOUBT IT SO YOU BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD RESIGN WHAT
MORE OR LESS IMMEDIATELY CALL AN ELECTION ASK THE QUEEN TO CALL AN ELECTION WHAT OF IT WE DON'T NEED AN ELECTION NECESSARILY UM IN THERE IS A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY ABBY WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW BORIS JOHNSON MICHAEL GOLD ONE OF THE WRECKS OF TEARS IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TAKING OVER THERE ARE TWO THINGS ONE IS A BREAKS IT PRIME MINISTER AND SECONDLY WE NEED A NEGOTIATING TEAM WHO WERE GOING TO GO TO BRUSSELS TO GET US A NEW DEAL BUT ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY LET'S START NEGOTIATING NOT JUST WITH BRUSSELS
BUT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE REAL OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'VE GOT FROM BRECK'S IT IS WE'VE LEFT THE FAILING POLITICAL UNION IN EUROPE WE CAN NOW START TO RE ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD QUITE A JOB THAT SO WE SHOULD INVOKE OR TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY
IMMEDIATELY FOR THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING IT ONE IS YOU INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY THE SECOND WAY OF DOING IT IS THAT YOU PASSED LEGISLATION IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAT AMENDS OR APPEALS THE ORIGINAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE DON'T CONCEDE TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WHAT ALL I THINK WE DO BUT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRIME MINISTER WHO IS COMMITTED TO DOING IT SO IF
CAMERA RESIGNS IF WE HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET A PROBE WRECKS IT PRIME MINISTER SABIA
RIGHT AND THEN THAT PROBE WRECKS IT PRIME MINISTER SHOULD HE OR SHE VOTE SHOULD HE OR SHE CALLED FOR THE TRIGGERING OF ARTICLE FIFTY IMMEDIATELY OR SHOULD THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY WHAT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AS A SAINT COULD GO BACK TO THE NINETY WHICH IF YOU PREFER WHICH DO YOU FAVOUR
WELL I THINK THAT WE HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT THAT IS CALLED THE LISBON TREATY I WOULD NEVER HAVE VOTED FOR IT MYSELF BUT I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO PLAY WITHIN THE RULES OF THE CLUB AND THEREFORE TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTH TRIG TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AND BEGIN THE PROCESS AND ARTICLE FIFTY IS IS THAT ARTICLE IS THAT BIT A LAW ON EUROPEAN LAW WHICH SAYS ONCE IT HAS BEEN TOO GOOD WE HAVE TWO YEARS WITHIN WHICH TO NEGOTIATE OUR DEPARTURE BUT YOU'RE UP TO TWO YEARS UP TO TWO YEARS YES I LIKE THAT I MEAN LOOK
THE FACT IS WE'VE GOT GENERAL ELECTIONS COMING UP NEXT YEAR IN GERMANY AND IN FRANCE ALREADY THE GERMAN CAR INDUSTRY ARE SCREAMING TO SAY CAN WE PLEASE GET ON WITH THIS I HAVE A SIMPLE FREE TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.K. AND WHO KNOWS WE MIGHT FINISH UP WITH A DEAL WITH THE E. THAT MY PARENTS' GENERATION THOUGHT THEY WERE VOTING FOR ALL THOSE YEARS AGO NAMELY A TRADE MARKET SO IT'S YOUR VIEW THAT HAVING TRIGGERED ARTICLE FIFTY WE COULD BE OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BY WHEN WHAT THE CRUCIAL THING IS THIS
THE ABSOLUTE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US OUT OF THIS YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR I REALLY WOULD BUT THE CRUCIAL THING IS WHEN WE FIGHT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION IF IT STAYS ON THE RECURRENT TIMETABLE
WE HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS A GENERAL ELECTION WHICH WE'RE VOTING FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT NOT JUST A CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT BECAUSE GIVEN THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR LAWS ARE MADE SOMEWHERE ELSE ELECTIONS HAVE JUST DIMINISHED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY REALLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT ANY LONGER DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHO MADE ANYWHERE ELSE MAYBE THE LAST TIME YOU'LL EVER SAY IT WELL WHO KNOWS AND AND
JOHN THE FIRST TIME I APPEARED ON THIS PROGRAMME WITH YOU WERE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WE WERE CONSIDERED TO BE A COMPLETE JOKE PARTY WITH A MANIFESTO THAT WAS FOR THE SORT OF MAD AND THE BAD AND NOW SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR IT AND I COULDN'T BE MORE DELIGHTED AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE DIDN'T SUGGEST SUCH A THING AT THE TIME THERE YOU GO NIGEL FURROWS THANKS VERY MUCH
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL A RATHER DIFFERENT VIEW FROM THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON WHO SAYS HE IS HEARTBROKEN AT THIS RESULT HE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU'VE ALSO SAID THAT YOU'RE ANGRY WITH EVERY CONSERVATIVE M.P. AND MINISTER WHO DENIGRATED THE Y. YOU OVER THE YEARS YEAH I MEAN I I WANT
LAY BLAME ANYWHERE THEN I GUESS IT COMES IN TWO PLACES ONE IS THE I CAN SEE EVERY MINISTER EVERY PRIME MINISTER EVERY TORY M.P. OVER THE LAST TWENTY ODD YEARS WHO KNOWING IT WAS IN BRITAIN'S INTEREST TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CHOSE INSTEAD FOR CHEAP POLITICAL SHORT TIME AGAIN TO SLAG IT OFF AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND THEN I GUESS ALSO UTTERLY FRUSTRATING ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE AND HONOUR TO SHARE A PLATFORM WITH PEOPLE LIKE HARRIET HARMAN INCH CREMONA ANDY BURNHAM AND INDEED OTHERS PEOPLE LIKE CAROLINE LUCAS
THE REALITY IS THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY HAS BEEN UTTERLY SPINELESS IN THIS CAMPAIGN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HIM TO TAKE A SERIOUS ROLE AND WE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE THE BRITAIN WE WAKE UP TO IS AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THE ONE THAT APPARENTLY IS A BRITAIN THAT IS A NIGEL FARRAJ HIS VISION OF BRITAIN IS NOT ONE I SHARE I TOTALLY AND UTTERLY ACCEPT THE RESULT AND THE DECISION OF THE
PEOPLE AT THE BALLOT BOX BUT I I RETAIN THE RIGHT TO STAND UP FOR THOSE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO SAID A DIFFERENT KIND OF BRITAIN IS THAT WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WANT HIS OUTWARD LOOKING DECENT INCLUSIVE INTERNATIONALIST AND I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP FIGHTING FOR THAT JUST BECAUSE OF THIS RESULT O.K. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A PRIME MINISTER WHO OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T SUPPORT BRECK'S IT HAVING TO NEGOTIATE IT DO YOU THINK A GENERAL ELECTION IS THE NEXT STEP
I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TO STEADY THE MARKETS WE HAVE ALREADY WITHIN A MATTER OF MINUTES SEEN THE PROJECTS HE WAS ACTUALLY PROJECT FACT AND WE'RE SEEING AN ABSOLUTE COLOSSAL A DROP IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND AND IF HE CANNOT STABILISE THE MARKET THEN HE NEEDS TO GO FRANKLY WHETHER HE'S BE A GENERAL ELECTION OR NOT THAT WILL COME ABOUT IN TIME BUT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR ME IS THAT WE DO NOT THOSE OF US WHO ARE PROGRESSIVES WHO ARE MODERATE DO NOT ACCEPT
THEIR VISION OF BRITAIN THAT NIGEL FARRAJ HAS JUST SET OUT ONE WHICH IS LONELY AND ISOLATED IMPOVERISHED AND FEARFUL OF THE OTHER THAT IS WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ABOUT AND THAT WAS WHAT IT LED TO THIS RESULT SO WHILST I UTTERLY ACCEPT THE OUTCOME I I DON'T I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF LEE
WAS SEVENTEEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO
THIS'LL DECLARATION THE NUMBER THE NUMBER OF BALLOT PAPERS REJECTED THE NUMBER OF BALLOT PAPERS REJECTED WAS AS FOLLOWS NO OFFICIAL MARK SO IT'S BRILLIANT THIRTY TWO BOTH
COURSE AS WE HAVE THE OFFICIAL DECLARATION OF THE RESULT OF THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO MARTIN SCHULTZ HAS SAID THAT THE U.K.'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS A DRAMATIC DAY BUT HE SAID YOU HE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE RESULT
WE HAVE PREPARED SINCE WEEKS WE HAD TWO OPTIONS REMAIN OR LEAVE AND PREPARE FOR BOTH SCENARIOS NOW I REGRET VERY MUCH THAT IT WAS THE RESULT
BUT THAT'S THE SURRENDER OF BRITISH WOOL TO SUDDENLY HAVE TO RESPECT HER PUP TO TAKE IN THE COLD I WOULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT THE PRICES BECAUSE WE ARE BETTER PREPARE UP THEN I THINK KING THEM ALL SINCE FORTY YEARS WAS VERY VERY COULD BE IF WE FLEDGED MEMBER OR NOT NO WE HAVE CLARITY
THINGS ARE CLEAR FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM TO GO A KNOWN WAY
ONE FIGURE IN OF THE LAST HOURS
BESIDE THE FALL OF THE POUND STERLING ON THE MARKETS PEOPLE RATE SINCE EIGHTY FIVE ONE OTHER FIGURE TOUCHED ME A LOT MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THIS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF THE VOTERS VOTED FOR REMAIN
I THINK THIS VERY SERIOUS BECAUSE THE FEELING OF THIS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR ME IN THERE WITH OUR FUTURE BET THAT WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEN OUTSIDE OF O.K. NOW THE MAJORITY HAS CHOSEN TO BE ALT AND TO LEAVE US LEAVE
AND THIS IS NOT A CRISIS FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT HAS AN APPEAL TO THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE REASONS WHY BRITISH AS WANTED TO LEARN SOME OF THEM BY VERY NATIONALIST REASONS OTHERS BY SOCIAL REASONS I THINK IS VERY SERIOUS I DO YOU'RE A SOLE END THERE WAS MEMBERS FOR WANT OF DRAWING
FIGHT NO TOGETHER AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AGAINST EX FRAUD TAX EVASION BUT TAKE A DAY MIGRATION TRAIL INTEREST THIS WOULD BE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER THAT WAS MARTIN SHORT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AS A SAID WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM DAVID CAMERON PROBABLY NOW AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK AND ALSO
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY THE BANK'S ALREADY SAID THAT THEY ARE MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY THEY'VE UNDERTAKEN EXTENSIVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING THEIR WORKING CLOSELY WITH H.M. TREASURY OTHER DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES AND OVERSEE CENTRAL BANKS AND THEY WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONETARY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY YOU ALL OUR BUSINESS PRESENTED ON IT O'CONNELL IS IN THE CITY ON THE U. B'S TRADING FLOOR DOMINIC
THANK YOU MUCH JOHN YES I'M JOINED BY SOME MIKE RAKE THE CHAIRMAN OF B.T. WHO'S ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT VOICES IN FAVOUR REMAIN IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SO MIGHT WHAT DOES THIS RESULT MEAN FUR FOR BIG BUSINESS WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS WHAT WE FEARED IS A POTENTIALLY PROLONG PERIOD OF VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY AND THESE ARE EXACTLY THE THINGS OF COURSE THAT MEDICATED MEDITATE AGAINST
INVESTMENT IN THE CREATION OF JOBS SO WE ARE ALL VERY VERY CONCERNED INDEED ABOUT HOW OUR POLITICAL LEADERS NOW DEAL WITH THE SITUATION TO TRY AND CREATE SOME STABILITY AND TRY AND ELIMINATE SOME OF THIS VOLATILITY AS SOON AS IS PRACTICAL
WHAT MEAN FOR WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT MEAN FOR BRITISH MANUFACTURING WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT I'M AIMING FOR THE CITY BUT THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME BIG INWARD INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THIS AREN'T THERE I THINK IT IS REALLY CLEAR FIRST OF ALL I THINK OF THE SHORT TIME SHORT TERM WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME PLUSES AND MINUSES CLEARLY THERE'S PRECIPITATE FALLING STERLING IT'S GOING TO MAKE A GOOD SMALL COMPETITIVE IN THE SHORT TERM BUT I THINK WE FACE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE A MOTORCAR INDUSTRIES ME VERY CLEAR IN THE SHORT TERM THERE WON'T BE A LAY OFF JOBS
BUT THE NEXT TIME THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON A MODEL BUT I HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT TRADING ARRANGEMENTS WE HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST I'M NOT YOU KNOW IT IS THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD A HUGE INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MORE THAN HALF OUR EXPORTS FOR EXAMPLE OF CARS GO TO EUROPEAN UNION SO THERE'LL BE SOME SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS TO BE MADE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS AROUND THE FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING UNITED KINGDOM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
ISN'T THERE A CHEERFUL FOR BIG BUSINESS LEADERS LIKE YOURSELF YOU SPOKE AT VERY PROBABLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN AND YET THE VOTE HAS COME OUT THE OTHER WAY IS THERE SOMETHING HERE AROUND THE REPUTATION AND TRUST WE HAVE A BIG BUSINESS ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETELY I MEAN I THINK TO ME FOR SOME TIME WHEN I WAS PRESENT AT THE C.B.I. WE DID A LOT OF WORK AND CLEARLY THERE'S BEEN A BREAKDOWN
OF TRUSTING THE ESTABLISHMENT AS A WHOLE I WOULD SAY INCLUDING THE POLITICAL SISTER POLITICAL PARTIES INCLUDING PIG BUSINESS INCLUDING THE SORT OF SERVICE INCLUDING MANY THINGS AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GREAT CONCERN WE DO NEED TO REMEMBER HOWEVER YOU KNOW THAT SIXTY PER CENT OF THE ELECTORATE HAVE EITHER VOTED TO REMAIN OUGHT TO ABSTAIN SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A VERY CALM REFLECTION
BY OUR POLITICAL LEADERS ON REALLY CITY LOOKING WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO CREATE STABILITY TO ENGAGE SENSIBLY WITH OUR TRADING PARTNERS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TRY AND CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE DAMAGE WILL BE MINIMISED AND WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE AGAIN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS AS YOU KNOW WAS THE IMPACT NOT JUST ON US BUT ON ON GLOBALLY AND YOU CAN SEE NOW THE MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WE ARE WHEN PEOPLE SIT ROUND AROUND THE BOARDROOMS AND BIG BRITISH COMPANIES THIS MORNING WHAT WILL THEY BE THINKING
WHAT WILL THEY BE PLANNING I THINK BIG BUSINESS WILL GET OVER PRETTY QUICKLY IT SENSE OF SHOCK AND CONCERN OF VOLATILITY WAS SIT DOWN EACH INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS TO LOOK AT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR IT AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO STABILISE THE POSITION AND WE OF COURSE AT THE END OF THE DAY HAVE A PERIOD OF TIME WILL RECOVER FROM THIS AND WILL TRY AND MAKE THOSE DECISIONS WHICH WE THINK ARE BEST FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS OUR STAKEHOLDERS
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE THAT BUSINESS MIGHT LEAD A CAMPAIGN TO GET US BACK INTO THE INTO THE UNION I DON'T PERSONALLY SEE THAT I THINK WE TRIED TO SPEAK OUT EIGHTY NINETY PER CENT OF BUSINESS SPOKE OUT VERY CLEARLY ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW AS THE FACTS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THIS ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAVING AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO REFORM
YEAH SO MY CRAIG THANK YOU VERY MUCH TONIC THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S UPDATE YOU ON WHAT WE NOW KNOW WITH ALL OF THE RESULTS IN THEIR VOTE TO LEAVE WAS FIFTY ONE POINT NINE PER CENT REMAINING FORTY EIGHT POINT ONE PER CENT NOW TO GIVE YOU THAT IN NUMBERS SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE WITH REMAIN SIXTEEN POINT ONE MILLION THAT'S A GAP
OF MORE THAN A MILLION FOR THE LEAVES SIDE WELL SO THAT I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW ALSO ON A TURNOVER OF SEVENTY TWO PERCENT THAT OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT WHAT THE UNIONS WANTED FRANCES O'GRADY HE'S THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE BRITISH TRADE UNION CONGRESS JOINS US NOW AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOU YOU WERE OF COURSE VERY PROMINENT CAMPAIGNER FOR REMAIN AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WHAT YOU WANTED WHAT'S YOUR REACTION FIRST OF ALL
WELL OF COURSE WE ACCEPT THE RESULT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN BUT THE FIRST PRIORITY NOW HAS TO BE ABOUT BUILDING CONFIDENCE TO STOP THE ECONOMY CRASHING AND WE ARE CALLING FOR A NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO PROTECT BRITISH JOBS AND THAT HAS TO IMPORT BUSINESS AND THE UNIONS BECAUSE WORKERS MUST PAY THE PRICE OF THIS BREAKTHROUGH
AND YET YOU WERE WARNING JUST A DAY OR SO AGO THAT WAVE WAGES WILL BE THIRTY POUNDS A WEEK LOWER IT POTENT POSES A RISK TO JOBS AND RIGHTS AT WORK
WELL WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE IT DOES AND OF COURSE WORKING PEOPLE I ALREADY FEEL THEY PAID THE PRICE BUT THE FINANCIAL CRASH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT THEY MUSTN'T PAY THE PRICE FOR THIS ONE BUT THE REAL PRIORITY RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THE ECONOMY CRASHING AND TO PROTECT JOBS AND WE WE THINK WE NEED EVERYBODY NOW NEEDS UNITY TO FOCUS ON THAT TOP PRIORITY THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR PUPILS
LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR FUTURES IT WAS OF COURSE WORKING PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THIS ABSOLUTELY AND OF COURSE THE TRADE UNION MEMBERS ARE NO DIFFERENT TO THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE BUT WE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH AS WE SAW IT AND IN TERMS OF THE RISK REAL RISK AND HAD TO PAY TO JOB SOME RIGHTS OF THE BRICKS IT BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK THE FOCUS HAS TO BE WHEN WE'RE SEEING THE POUND
FALLING AND WE KNOW THE IMPACT THAT WILL HAVE ON PRICES AND LIVELIHOODS AND PENSIONS THAT WE NEED TO GET AROUND A TABLE BUSINESS UNIONS AND GOVERNMENT HAVE A WORK TOGETHER TO PROTECT JOBS GIVEN HER PASSIONATELY YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS I WONDER WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF TIM FARRON THE LIB DEM LEADER HIS COMMENTS ABOUT JEREMY CORBIN ACCUSING HIM OF UTTER SPINELESS NURSE OVER THE CAMPAIGN
LOOK ELLIE LABOUR'S POSITION WAS CLEAR HERMIT WHO WAS REMAIN DAVID CAMERON'S POSITION WAS CLEAR AND SO WAS OURS I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS HE'S HEALED THE WOUNDS IN THE COUNTRY I DON'T THINK I THINK THIS IS ABOUT MUCH MORE FRANKLY THAN THEIR CAREERS OF POLITICAL LEADERS OR POLITICAL PARTIES THIS IS ABOUT WORKING PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO NEED SECURITY FOR THEIR FUTURE AND NEED TO BE CONFIDENT THAT THEY WON'T END UP PAYING THE PRICE YET AGAIN
FRANCES O'GRADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT A QUICK SPORT GARY HOW QUICK YOU WANT IT VERY QUICK OH K. THIS ROOM

THANKS VERY MUCH THE WEATHER THE SUNSHINE IN SOME PLACES HEAVY SHOWERS THERE ARE GOING TO GOING TO CONTINUE IT WILL BE DRY FOR THE SOUTH EAST THOUGH YOU'RE LISTENING TO DO GO ON RADIO FOUR WITH SORT OF MONTAGUE AND JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EAT A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS NOW FROM THAT
THE U.K. HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION FORTY THREE YEARS AFTER JOINING THE COMMON MARKET THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM WAS CONFIRMED AT EXACTLY SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION VOTED FOR A BRITISH EXIT SIXTEEN POINT ONE MILLION WERE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN WHICH MEANT THAT LEAVE ONE BY FOUR PER CENT TURNOUT WAS SEVENTY TWO PER CENT TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN A NATIONWIDE BALLOT IN THE U.K. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT OF THE REMAIN SIDE APPEARED HOPEFUL OF VICTORY BUT THIS CHANGED WHEN RESULTS BEGAN TO BE ANNOUNCED IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND TRADITIONAL LABOUR VOTERS HAD DEFIED THEIR PARTY STANCE AND STRONGLY BACKED LEAVE REMAIN HAD HOPE THAT BIG ENGLISH CITIES WOULD HELP THEM WIN BUT THEIR MARGIN OF VICTORY IN THESE AREAS WAS MUCH SLIMMER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED IN LONDON VOTERS STRONGLY BACKED STAYING IN BUT IT WAS THE ONLY REGION OF ENGLAND TO DO SO
IN WALES THERE WAS AN EMPHATIC THOSE IN FAVOUR OF BRICKS IT WITH SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY TWO AREAS BACKING LEAVE IN SCOTLAND ALL THIRTY TWO AREAS VOTED TO REMAIN NORTHERN IRELAND ALSO VOTED TO STAY IN BY A MARGIN OF NEARLY TWELVE PER CENT
THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL HER ARCH CALLED IT A VICTORY FOR REAL ORDINARY DECENT PEOPLE AND SAID DAWN WAS BREAKING ON AN INDEPENDENT UNITED KINGDOM HE TOLD US DAVID CAMERON SHOULD QUIT AND BE REPLACED BY A PRIME MINISTER WHO BACK TO BRITISH EXIT SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON HAS HINTED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM IN THE FUTURE SHE SAID THE VOTE MAKE CLEAR THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SAW THEIR FUTURE AS PART OF THE E.U.
STIRLING HAS SUFFERED ITS BIGGEST ONE DAY FALL THE VALUE OF THE POUND WRONG TO ONE DOLLAR THIRTY FIVE A LEVEL NOT SEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE IN A STATEMENT THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID IT WAS MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY AND IT WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONETARY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY BUT THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A WARNING FROM THE CREDIT RATING AGENCY STANDARD AND PAUSE THAT THE U.K. IS LIKELY TO LOSE ITS TRIPLE A. CREDIT RATING
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WELL WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON THIS MORNING WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM JEREMY CORBIN SHORTLY TO NOW THOUGH LET'S WE CAN SPEAK TO IN WESTMINSTER THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING ARE VERY PROMINENT VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGNER GOOD MORNING TO HOWEVER AND YOU MUST BE HAPPY THIS MORNING I'M VERY PLEASED I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT RESULT FOR BRITAIN I THINK IT WILL GIVE US A STRONG FUTURE WITH AN INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
BUT I THINK NOW THE KEY THING IS THAT WE NEED A PERIOD OF CALM WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE PROCESS OF LEAVING WE NEED TO GET THE RIGHT TEAM IN LINE FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS AND ABOVE ALL I AM VERY COMMITTED TO KEEPING DAVID CAMERON IN HIS POST I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ENSURING WE HAVE STABILITY IN THE MARKETS AND THAT WE HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE PROCESS TO TAKE US OUT BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO THIS RESULT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN IT HOW CAN HE THEREFORE BE THE PERSON THAT OVERSEAS
THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME WILL BY DEFINITION HE IS THE PERSON WHO GAVE US THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE HE KNEW WHEN HE OFFERED THAT REFERENDUM THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CHOICE FOR THE PUBLIC THAT THEY COULD GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT ONLY HAS HE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB FOR THIS COUNTRY OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS BUT HE ACTUALLY IS THE BEST PERSON WITH THEIR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS HE HAS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS TO TAKE US TO THE NEXT STAGE WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND INTERESTING TO PROGRESS AND HE'S THE BEST PERSON TO LEAD IT
TRICKY PERSONAL RELATIONS ONE IMAGINES WITH SOME OF HIS FORMER FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES WHO SHOULD BE IN THAT RIGHT TEAM WHO SHOULD BE OVERSEEING THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE WHATEVER IT IS JUST ABOUT CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS I THINK WE NEED A BROAD RANGING TEAM WE NEED NIGEL BARRAGE AND BUSINESS WE NEED TO INVOLVE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM THIS IS A NATIONAL PROCESS SEAN WHAT DO YOU GIVE THE LEADING ROLE TO SOMEBODY LIKE BORIS JOHNSON MICHAEL GO FOR YOURSELF
NIGEL FARRELL I THINK IT'S FOR THE PRIME MINISTER FOR THE CABINET DECIDES THE NEXT STEPS FORWARD I THINK THAT SOMETHING IS TO WAIT FOR WHEN WE MEET AND DISCUSS HOW WE APPROACH THINGS BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO DO THIS CAREFULLY TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT SIR GET THE PREPARATIONS IN THE RIGHT SHAPE TO HAVE INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER E.U. LEADERS BEFORE WE START THE FORMAL PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YES THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR DESTINY
THAT'S A REAL POSITIVE WE'VE GOT TO DO IT IN THE RIGHT WAY WE COULD DO IT CAREFULLY I WANT US TO STAY CAN I FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS OF OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS ARE YOU UNNERVED BY WHAT YOU'VE SEEN ON THE MARKETS WE'VE HAD STERLING FALLS TO LEVELS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN THIRTY YEARS AND MANY ON YOUR SIDE WAS SAYING LOOK IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A CONCERN THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PERIOD OF TURBULENCE IN THE MARKETS WHAT MATTERS NOW IS IT'S A SHORT TERM PERIOD OF TURBULENCE WE KNOW MARKETS CAN MOVE UP AND DOWN PRETTY SHARPLY PRETTY QUICKLY
I KNOW THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL BE TAKING APPROPRIATE STEPS TO STABILISE THE MARKETS IF WE CAN OFFER POLITICAL STABILITY AND A CLEAR PATH FORWARD THAT WILL HELP TO NOTHING'S ACTUALLY CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY IN PRACTICAL TERMS WE'VE STILL GOT THE SAME TRADING ARRANGEMENTS WERE STILL MEMBERS THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS SOME CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME AHEAD BEFORE WE COMPLETE THE NEGOTIATIONS AND LEAVE RIGHT YOU WANT DAVID CAMERON IN POST TO THINK THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD
I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR JOBS THE CHANCE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN HELPING TURN THIS ECONOMY AROUND ALSO THE PERSON WHO TALKED ABOUT AN EMERGENCY BUDGET I THINK IT'S NOW A QUESTION FOR THE CABINET TO SIT DOWN COLLECTIVELY AND SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT HOW WE GOING TO DO THIS WHO'S GOING TO DO IT WHO WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN FROM OUTSIDE THE WORLD OF POLITICS WE WANT BUSINESS EXPERTISE WORKING ALONGSIDE YOUR SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN AND NOW THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE DIFFERENT I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT
PREPARATION AND NOT SACKINGS OR RESIGNATIONS I THINK IT'S ABOUT US DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE COUNTRY WE'VE TAKEN A HUGE STEP THIS MORNING IT IS A FANTASTIC STEP IN MY VIEW FOR THIS COUNTRY I WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THEIR VIEWS TOO THEY WILL EXPECT US TO TAKE THIS CAREFULLY AND RESPONSIBLY AND WE SHOULD DO THAT WITHOUT PRECIPITATE DECISIONS
ONE OF THOSE OF COURSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR THIS IS THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID COME AND HE'S GOING TO BE FEELING VERY BRUISED HE IS PRESUMED POSSIBLY FEELING LIKE GOING WELL I'M SURE HE WILL NOT BE HAPPY TO HAVE LOST THIS REFERENDUM I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I HOPE AND BELIEVE HE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE HE WILL NOW PLAY IN MAKING SURE WE GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF STABILITY
IT'S A CONTINUITY OF LEADERSHIP SENSIBLE DISCUSSION WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS WHERE HE HAS THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO US HE HAS A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB TO DO NOW HE MUST KNOW HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WENT INTO THIS PROCESS WILL BE STOOD ON ELECTION MANIFESTO THE PROMISED THE PEOPLE AS COUNTRY A CHOICE THAT THEY MIGHT CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT WE ARGUED FOR WILL RESPECT THAT
CHRIS GRAYLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY TO EIGHT OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN DIVIDED THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL SCENE PERHAPS AS NEVER BEFORE LABOUR AND CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT FOR EXCUSE ME SUPPORTERS VOTING IN LARGE NUMBERS AGAINST THEIR OWN PARTY'S STANCE OF THE LABOUR PARTY LEADER JEREMY CORBIN JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER MY YOUR REACTION BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE SEE YOU WON'T BE DESPERATELY SORRY THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RESULT THAT IS THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR VIEWS KNOWN WE NOW NEED TO TRY TO STABILISE THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROTECT JOBS BUT ALSO RECOGNISE THAT THE LEVELS OF INEQUALITY IN BRITAIN
HAVE LED PEOPLE OFTEN TOO I BELIEVE VOTING IN THIS PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND OUR JOB NOW IS TO TRY AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER
AND ALSO PROTECTS THE WORKING CONDITIONS WHICH I SAID A GREAT DEAL ABOUT DURING THE PAST MONTH AND A HALF OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN RIDING THAT STABILITY YOU'RE AFTER THEN PRESUMABLY YOU WOULD SUPPORT DAVID CAMERON STAYING IN PLACE WOULD YOU WELL IT'S DAVID CAMERON'S IMMEDIATE JOB AS THAT OF GEORGE OSBORNE IS OF COURSE TO TRY TO STABILISE THE POUND BECAUSE IT CONTINUING RUN ON THE POUND WILL HAVE
OBVIOUSLY ENORMOUS ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND ALSO TO BEGIN A PLAN FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ORDER TO PROTECT
MARKETS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF A VERY LARGE PORTION PROBABLY HALF OF OUR EXPORTS ACTUALLY GO TO THE EUROPEAN UNION IS VERY HIGH I FIGURE INDEED AND MANY JOBS ARE DEPENDENT ON THAT THOSE HAVE TO BE PROTECTED
AND WHAT IT WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW IN YOUR VIEW SHOULD WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTEEN WHICH STARTS THE PROCESS OF US LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IMMEDIATELY SHOULD THERE BE A PAUSE SHOULD WE TRY OTHER METHODS OF GETTING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT THE REFERENDUM IS QUITE CLEARLY MADE DECISION PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THEREFORE THAT DECISION MUST BE RESPECTED
THAT DECISION MUST BE EMBRACED AND WE HAVE TO THEN WORK OUT A FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ANY INDEED WAS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA THOSE ISSUES ARE A PRIORITY I DON'T THINK THERE CAN BE
EATING THAT DECISION NEITHER SHOULD THERE BE ANY WAY AVOIDING THAT TO SIT RIGHT SO WHEN DO WE DO IT WHERE DO WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIRST WELL THAT WILL BE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHEN THAT FOR I THINK WE SHOULD SET OUT WHAT THE OBJECTIVES ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS AND THEN APPROPRIATE TIME INVOKE IT IN ORDER TO START THOSE NEGOTIATE SET OUT THE IDEAS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO
ACHIEVE A COUNTRY RIGHT BUT THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG WHORE THAN A LONG WEEKEND SHOULD IT ME WHEN WHEN SHOULD WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY IT'S UP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHAT DO YOU THINK I DO IT I THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN REASONABLE TIME IN ORDER TO BUT FIRST OF ALL SET OUT THE IDEA OF WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE HAVE THAT DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT AND THEN MOVE ON FROM THAT STAGE I DO DAYS OR WEEKS I DON'T THINK WE CAN PUT AN EXACT DATE ON IT BUT I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A STATEMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY
THE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC ISSUES AND THEN THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS MINIMUM TIME FOR NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE TWO YEARS ANYWAY
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN POSITION BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE THAT YOU BEAR AT LEAST PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS RESULT BECAUSE YOU WERE AT BEST LUKEWARM IN YOUR SUPPORT FOR REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
ON THE CONTRARY I THINK THAT THE VIEWS I PUT FORWARD ACTUALLY DID REFLECT THE VIEWS OF AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE I CAMPAIGN THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS COUNTRY EVERY MAJOR TOWN AND CITY WE'VE HAD EVENTS IN AND WE'VE MADE THE POINT ABOUT PROTECTING OF WORKING CONDITIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTOCOLS AND SOME OF THE VERY BENEFICIAL THINGS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION I ALSO
POINTED OUT THAT THERE HAD TO BE AN END TO THE UNDERCUTTING OF WAGES THEREFORE I INSISTED ON THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTING THE
POSTING OF WORKERS' DIRECTIVE AND THE AGENCY WORKERS ISSUE AND ALSO TO ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS WE HAVE SOME GROTESQUE LEVELS OF APPALLING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN BRITAIN BECAUSE THEY'VE MANAGED TO CIRCUMVENT THESE REGULATIONS BUT HOW WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT SCENARIO AND WE HAVE TO
TRY TO IMPROVE AND PROTECT WORKING CONDITIONS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THE FACT IS THAT YOUR SUPPORTERS DECISIVELY REJECTED YOUR APPROACH THAT MUST WEAKEN YOUR POSITION
LABOUR VOTERS VOTED SOME VOTED TO LEAVE SOME VOTED TO REMAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT BREAKDOWN OF FIGURES IS BUT I DO KNOW LOOKING AT THE RESULTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND SOME AREAS THAT ARE VERY STRONG FOR LABOUR SUCH AS MUCH OF LONDON VOTED VERY STRONGLY
REMAIN OTHER AREAS THAT ARE STRONG FOR LABOUR SUCH AS THE NORTH EAST VOTED IN VARYING DEGREES SOME CASES VERY LARGE DEGREES TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SO QUITE CLEARLY
PEOPLE THAT VOTED LABOUR MANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE INDEED MANY VOTERS DRAMATIC NEVERTHELESS THE PARTY COMES TOGETHER NEVERTHELESS THE COUNTRY MUST COME TOGETHER NEVER THE LESS WE HAVE TO PUT FORWARD AND GENDER
FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY WITHIN OUR SOCIETY IN THAT'S WHAT WE THE LABOUR PARTY WILL BE DOING TO PEOPLE LIKE TIM FARRON OR WHO HAS A GOOD LEADER OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WHO'S ACCUSED YOU OF UTTER A SPINELESS AND US IN THE WAY YOU APPROACH THIS WHOLE THING YOU'D SAY WHAT
STRANGE FORM OF WORDS I HAVE PUT OUT A STRONG CASE ON BEHALF OF A PARTY FOR THE WAY IN WHICH WE WOULD HAVE SOUGHT TO REMAIN WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ORDER TO REFORM IT I'M QUITE REALISTIC ABOUT ITS MANY SHORTCOMINGS
I'M ALSO QUITE REALISTIC ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT COULD COME FROM IT AND THIS IS WHY WE PUT FORWARD THE CASE FOR REFORM I THINK THAT WAS ONE THAT MANY PEOPLE CLEARLY DID SUPPORT BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT A MAJORITY BUT I WAS ALSO GOING TO HAVE YOUR OWN SPECIFIC POSITION AND THE ATTACKS ON YOU PERSONALLY
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN THE ATTACKS AND ME PERSONALLY IN A DAY LIKE THIS WHAT IF I AM DOING IS SETTING OUT OUR PARTY'S POSITION A PARTY POLICY AND THIS MORNING WILL HAVE A SHADOW CABINET MEETING WHEN WE'LL BE OBVIOUSLY FURTHER DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES AND I WOULD EXPECT THE PRIME MINISTER BE MAKE A STATEMENT PARLIAMENT ON MONDAY WHICH WE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE READY FOR WHERE DO YOU WANT US TO BE IN THREE MONTHS FROM NOW
HAVING A CLEAR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL ON OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE CLEAR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF WHERE OUR FUTURE TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE AND A CLEAR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL ON PROTECTING THE WORKING CONDITIONS THAT WE'VE GOT THROUGH EUROPEAN REGULATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL
REGULATIONS AND OF COURSE THE HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT DO YOU OWN QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND YOU WOULD EXPECT US TO HAVE EMBARKED ON THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID CAMERA STILL IN POWER
AND YOURSELF STILL IN WELL WE'VE ALREADY EMBARKED ON THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BY THE REFERENDUM RESULT THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD THIS MORNING WHETHER LET THE CAMERAS IN OFFICE OR NOT I DON'T KNOW
I'VE BEEN ELECTED TO LEAD THIS PARTY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE IN A GENERAL ELECTION AT SOME POINT IN THE NEARISH FUTURE
WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS OVER THERE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BECAUSE CLEARLY DAVE'S ARE AT IT WAIT A MINUTE THE PRIORITY HAS TO BE STABILISING THE POUND AND STABILISING THE ECONOMY BECAUSE CLEARLY
JOB LOSSES COULD WELL BE IN THE OFFING AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND WE DO NOT NEED ON THE STEREOTYPE BUDGET WHICH WAS THREATENED BY THOSE WHO PROMOTED THE CAMPAIGN IS A SERIES OF CATASTROPHES ON EITHER SIDE INSTEAD WHERE WE WILL OPPOSE MY BUDGET BECAUSE WE BELIEVED THAT THE PROBLEMS OF INEQUALITY IN BRITAIN ACTUALLY LIKE THAT ALL RIGHT SO SO WHAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN THEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS THAT WOODS HAVE YOU SAYING YES WE MUST KNOW OF A GENERAL ELECTION
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS HAS TO BE SAID THE TEMP STABILISE THE NUMBER THAT'S A RICHER FULLY CROAK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT A MASSIVELY IMPORTANT OF COURSE BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY YOU WERE NOBODY WOULD ARGUE WITH THAT WITH THAT THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN OR SHOULD HAPPEN TO HAVE YOU SAY EITHER THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL ELECTION ALL THEY SHOULDN'T BE LET'S CARRY ON AS WE ARE GOVERNMENT HAS TO COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE PLAN
OF HOW IT'S GOING TO DEAL WITH THE EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HOW IT'S NOT GOING TO HIT THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND POOREST WITHIN OUR SOCIETY AND A LONGER TERM PLAN ON THE FUTURE TRADING RELY ON COUNTRY WITH THAT PLAN YOU WERE THEN CALL FOR YOU FROM WHAT DO YOU WAS THAT WOULD YOU SAY LET US DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE WHEN IT COMES ROUND WHICH WILL I THINK BE VERY VERY SOON WE DO NOT NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION THIS MORNING WE HAD A VERY BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY OTHER
VERY URGENT OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT I TELL YOU THIS THE LABOUR PARTY IS MORE THAN READY TO PUT FORWARD A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR THIS COUNTRY THAN THE GOVERNMENT DOES THAT DOES DEAL WITH UNDER EMPLOYMENT UNEMPLOYMENT AND INSECURE EMPLOYMENT AND DOES DEAL WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS AT SO MANY PEOPLE FACE JEREMY CORBIN MANY THANKS
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THERE'S A RESULT HAS NOW CLEAR OUR EMOTIONS THIS MORNING WILL BE STRONGLY CONTRASTING HUGELY EXCITED AND EXHILARATED OR APPALLED AND DEEPLY DEPRESSED
HOWEVER ARE FEELING THE CHANGE IS SAYERS MICK WITH HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERY COUNTRY IN THE U.K. FOR AS ONE HEADLINE PUT IT YESTERDAY WHO DO WE WANT TO BE AND THIS INVOLVES NOT JUST A NATIONAL IDENTITY BUT OUR CORE IDENTITY AS A HUMAN PERSON
AS WE ENTER THIS PERIOD OF GREAT TURBULENCE THAT WELL UNDER LIE MUCH OF WHAT WE DECIDE
ONE OF THE ADVANCES IN RECENT YEARS IS THE REALISATION THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES FOR EXAMPLE I REGARD MYSELF AS WELSH BY NATIONALITY BRITISH BY CITIZENSHIP EUROPEAN BY CULTURE AND CHRISTIAN RELIGION IT ALL GOES TO MAKE UP WHAT I AM
THE PROBLEM WITH ALL IDENTITIES HOWEVER IS THAT THEY ARE POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE IF I'M ENGLISH I'M NOT FRIENDSHIP I'M A CHRISTIAN I'M NOT MUSLIM AND SO ON AND AS WE KNOW SO WELL THIS DIVISIVENESS CAN LEAD TO WAR BETWEEN NATIONS VIOLENCE BETWEEN FOOTBALL CROWDS AND FOUL ABUSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA
AT A TIME LIKE THIS WITH SUCH COMPLEX NEGOTIATIONS AND DECISIONS AHEAD I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK FOR FORMS OF IDENTITY WHICH INCLUDE OTHERS RATHER THAN EXCLUDE THEM WHICH BIND US TOGETHER HOWEVER MUCH WE MIGHT DISAGREE WITH THEM
HOWEVER WE VOTED ON THE REFERENDUM WE ARE ALL BRITISH CITIZENS WHATEVER OUR VIEWS ON THE EUROPEAN UNION WE CONTINUE TO BE HEIRS OF EUROPEAN CULTURE
ALTHOUGH RELIGION HAS TOO OFTEN BEEN DEEPLY DIVISIVE I BELIEVE THE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD IT SHOULD BE A BINDING FACTOR ACROSS OR OUTER DIVISIONS AND THIS IS BECAUSE RELIGION IS ABOUT WHERE OUR ULTIMATE LOYALTY LIES AND WHAT IS ULTIMATE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED WITH ANYTHING THAT IS FINITE AND LIMITED WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE HAD IDOLATRY
I DON'T KNOW TREE ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT WORSHIPPING STATUES AS MAKING WHAT IS LESS ULTIMATE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE AND THAT BITE ME A NATION IT MIGHT BE A POLITICAL CAUSE OR A POLITICAL PARTY OR RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY OR EVEN A FOOTBALL TEAM
FROM THAT WIDER PERSPECTIVE WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE EVEN THOSE WITH WHOM WE STRONGLY DISAGREE AS WITH US AND NOT AGAINST US
WE'RE NOT JUST FELLOW CITIZENS WE ARE FROM A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW MADE IN THE DIVINE IMAGE AND CALL TO GROW INTO THE DIVINE LIGHTNESS
WE'RE NOT A BEGINNING OF A PERIOD OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY WITH ALL KIND OF POTENTIAL DANGERS AND OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD WE'RE LIKE A SHIP THAT SUDDENLY HIT A MAJOR STORM AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN THROWN AROUND
WHATEVER WAY WE VOTED AND WHATEVER FEELINGS ARE NOW WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY THROUGH TOGETHER AS WE ARE ALL IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PART OF THE CREW NOT JUST PASSENGERS
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY TO BOOK WITH RICHARD HARRIES THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT AND A QUICK REMINDER FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST WAKING UP OF WHAT THE RESULT ACTUALLY IS THIS MORNING SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS A MAJORITY A MAJORITY OF FIFTY ONE POINT NINE PER CENT ON A TURNOVER OF SEVENTY TWO PER CENT OF THE
ELECTORATE WELL OF THE ROSS HAWKINS OUR CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN A MANCHESTER WHERE IS THE OFFICIAL COUNT THE POINT AT WHICH THE FINAL DECLARATIONS WERE MADE AND ROSS QUITE A REMARKABLE NIGHT AN EXTRAORDINARY NIGHT IN A NIGHT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE AT THE START FAILED TO READ FAILED TO FORECAST NOW ONLY JUST
COMING TO TERMS WITH THEIR BEGINNING TO PACK AWAY HERE LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT SOME OF THE DRAMA WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY THERE IS GENUINE OUTRAGE IN FURY FROM SOME LABOUR M.P.S AT JEREMY CORBIN'S PERFORMANCE THIS MORNING THE SUGGESTION THAT HE MADE ON THE B. B. C. THAT ARTICLE FIFTY THIS PROCESS OF A TWO YEAR SET TIMESCALE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD BE INVOKED STRAIGHTAWAY IS
ANGERED SOME OF THEM ONE INFLUENTIAL FIGURE HAS SAID TO ME THAT WHILE THERE ISN'T A LETTER GOING AROUND HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO SOMEHOW OUST HIM THAT IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE THAT THERE IS NOW A NEW LEADER IN THE LABOUR PARTY ANOTHER LABOUR M. P. SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THE SCRIPTS THAT WAS LEAKED
THAT LABOUR SPOKE PEOPLE WERE MEANT TO USE SAYING THAT JEREMY CALLING WAS UNIQUE THE PLACE AS A CRITICAL REMAIN WAS OUTRAGEOUS AND RIDDLED WITH LIES THEIR VIEW IS THAT LABOUR SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON BUSINESS ON JOBS ON MORTGAGES THIS MORNING AND ALTHOUGH IT IS PRETTY MUCH A SECONDARY ISSUE COMPARED TO WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL OR WILL NOT TELL US IN THE COMING OUR ALSO THERE IS A GENUINE HIGH FEELING WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY RIGHT
ROSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MAKING A STATEMENT AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT THIS MORNING BUT THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN SOME REACTION SUITABLE REACTION IN BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CATCHER ADLER JOINS US CATCHER WHAT'S BEING SAID
NOT JUST IN BRUSSELS BUT ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE BEEN HEARING STRONG REACTION WE'VE LITERALLY JUST HEARD FROM DONALD TUSK OR HE'S THE MAN WHO REPRESENTS ALL THE E.U. LEADERS HERE IN BRUSSELS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND HE SAID THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR HYSTERIA WHAT MY FATHER USED TO TELL ME IS WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER BUT THE ACTUAL FEELING ON THE GROUND
THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST BODY BLOW YET FOR THE Y. U. WHICH WAS ALREADY REELING FROM THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND THE EURO CRISIS AND FEARS ABOUT WHAT SEEN AS AN AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA NEXT DOOR AND NOW BRECK SET AS THE U.K. LOOKS AT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OR SEE WHAT THE EFFECT ON THE POUND MIGHT BE

OF COURSE I MEAN HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER NOT ONLY WHO GAVE US THE BRITISH PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS REFERENDUM A DECISION THEY'RE NOT EVERYBODY THOUGHT WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME BUT HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER WHO PUT HIMSELF FRONT AND CENTRAL IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND HE'S NOW THE PRIME MINISTER WHO FINDS HIMSELF HUMILIATED SNUBBED BY THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE SAID NO TO WHAT HE WAS OFFERING IS A HUGE BLOW TO HIS PERSONAL AUTHORITY
REMEMBER HE IS ALSO A PRIME MINISTER WHO EVEN BEFORE THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION WHICH YOU DID WIN SNEAKING IN

DAVID CAMERON'S FELLOW LEADERS WILL EXPECT HIM TO INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY OF THE LISBON TREATY NEXT WEEK TRIGGERING A DIVORCE NEGOTIATION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS A VASTLY COMPLICATED LEGAL AND POLITICAL PROCESS THE BIG QUESTION WHAT KIND OF ACCESS WILL THE U.K. HAVE TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST SINGLE MARKET
THE REST OF THE E.U. WILL WANT TO FORGE A GOOD DEAL WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT BUT IN MANY CAPITALS THERE WILL BE LITTLE APPETITE FOR DOING THE U.K. ANY FAVOURS EURO SCEPTICISM IS ON THE RISE ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL LEADERS WILL NOT WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT LEAVING IS EASY WITH LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SUGGESTING THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION IN THE AUTUMN A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG CONSIDERS WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THE PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST COLLEAGUES USED TO SAY HE WAS A LUCKY POLITICIAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIGGEST GAMBLE OF HIS CAREER HIS LUCK HAS DRAMATICALLY RUN OUT IN A SNUB TO HIM A SNUB TO THE STATUS QUO HAD A SNUB TO THE ENTIRE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT BRITAIN HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TEAR UP THE SETTLEMENT THE COUNTRY'S HAD FOR DECADES UNLEASHING PERHAPS HUGE OPPORTUNITY OR PERHAPS HUGE RISK
PERHAPS BOTH THE COUNTRY'S DECISION CHANGES ALMOST EVERYTHING ALL THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN THE BRITISH MOTORIST TEND TO VOTE FOR WHAT THE CONSENSUS TELLS THEM HE'S THEIR ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST AND THAT REFERENDA THOSE VOTES WHERE THERE WAS ONLY BLACK AND WHITE NO SHADES OF GREY TEND TO PRODUCE THE STATUS QUO
AND IT COULD NOW SHATTERED THE PRIME MINISTER'S CAREER DESPITE PUBLIC PROTESTATIONS TO THE CONTRARY LETTERS FROM LOYALISTS PROMISES OF SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER'S TIME IN OFFICE MAY WELL BE CURTAILED THE TENSION CAN HE STAY IN OFFICE WITH HIS AUTHORITY DRAINED BY A DEFEAT OR WILKIE ENDEAVOUR TO STAY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE STABILITY AT A TIME OF CHANGE
OUR CORRESPONDENTS JOHNNY DIAMOND HAS SPENT THE LAST TEN WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN TRAVELLING ACROSS THE COUNTRY HE'S BEEN TALKING TO VOTERS FROM FISHERMEN IN CORNWALL TO STUDENTS IN GLASGOW ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATES THEM HE HAS THIS ASSESSMENT OF WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE U.K. HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
REVOLT CAME IN MANY GUISES AGAINST PARTY WITH A HUGE NUMBER OF LABOUR SUPPORTERS VOTING FIRMLY AGAINST THE LEADERSHIP LINE AGAINST THE DOMINANCE OF LONDON AS MUCH OF ENGLAND VOTED IN OPPOSITION TO THE CAPITAL AGAINST THE ADVICE OF GOVERNMENT OF COUNTLESS EXPERTS HAVE NEARLY ALL THE U.K.'S ALLIES
ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS OF THE LONG CAMPAIGN DID MAKE IT ONTO DOORSTEPS BUT CYNICISM ABOUT THE IDEAS OF THE POLITICAL AND METROPOLITAN CLASS WAS EVERYWHERE THE BACK AND FORTH OF WHAT OFTEN LOOKED LIKE A CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN LEFT MANY COLD WHILST ALARM OF IMMIGRATION CONCERN OVER PUBLIC SERVICES AND THE GAP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT RAN VERY DEEP
HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND WRONGS OF THE E.U. WILL BE LONG DEBATED BELIEVE CAMPAIGN TAPPED INTO A DEEP WELL OF SOMETIMES ANGRY RESENTMENT OR FEELING IN THE SMALLER TOWNS AND CITIES OF ENGLAND AND WALES BUT THE BIG CITIES AND THE BIG POLITICAL PARTIES HAD LOST TOUCH WITH THEM AND THAT THE PROSPERITY ENJOYED BY THE COSMOPOLITAN CLASS WAS OUT OF THEIR REACH THIS WAS A VOTE ABOUT THE E.U. BUT IT WAS ALSO A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE BY THE BRITISH IN WHAT THEIR COUNTRY HAS BECOME
JOHNNY DIAMOND REPORTING THERE TWELVE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHILE THE COUNTRY IS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A NEW CHAPTER IN ITS HISTORY WE HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BY A MAJORITY OF FIFTY ONE POINT NINE PER CENT SO NOW WHAT
WE DON'T KNOW IS THE SHORT ON TO THAT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT THIS IS A SEISMIC MOMENT IN BRITAIN'S HISTORY DAVID CAMERON WILL APPEAR OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET WE THINK POSSIBLY IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES BUT CERTAINLY WITH AN X. R. TO MAKE A SPEECH THAT HE HOPED AND PRAYED HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO MAKE OBVIOUSLY WE SHALL GO OVER TO DOWNING STREET AS SOON AS HE MAKES AN APPEARANCE BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY THERESA VILLIERS THE NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY AND A PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNER AND YOU WILL BE I SUPPOSE DELIGHTED IT'S THIS MORNING
I'M I'M OBVIOUSLY DELIGHTED AT THE RESULTS STILL IN A DEGREE OF SHOCK ABOUT IT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPECT IT BUT I THINK THE COUNTRY'S MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE IT'S TIME TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT SELF GOVERNING DEMOCRACY AGAIN AND WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER OR STEPS OUT IN THE NEXT AND IT'S ALSO TO MAKE A STATEMENT
WHAT DO YOU HOPE HE WILL SAY PUT ASIDE ALL THAT ALL THE STUFF YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO SAY I'D BE UNITED BRITAIN WE MUST MOVE FORWARD IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS THAT AND THE OTHER HE WILL SAY THAT OF COURSE BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY WELL I THINK I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT THE HEART OF WHAT HE WILL SAY
IS THE IMPORTANCE OF UNITING PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT A AS SHARPLY DIVIDED COUNTRY ON THIS QUESTION WAS THERE WAS A MAJORITY TO LEAVE THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WHO WANTED TO REMAIN
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS OF REASSURANCE NOW A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND CALM I WOULD NEED TO REFLECT ON HOW WE TAKE THINGS FORWARD BUT ALSO I THINK IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REASSURE THOSE WHO VOTED FOR REMAIN THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION DOESN'T MEAN
DISENGAGING WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS ARE NO LONGER CO OPERATING WITH THEM OF COURSE WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHERE WE WANT TO CO OPERATE IN ON MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST IT'S JUST WE DON'T NEED TO THE TRAPPINGS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DO THAT AND WHO IS GOING TO TAKE US THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS OR DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE IT COULD BE DAVID CAMERON
ABSOLUTELY I DO I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT DAVID CAMERON STAYS ON HE HAS THE STRONGEST MAN MANDATE POSSIBLE FROM A GENERAL ELECTION WHICH HE WON WENT NOBODY SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON THEIR DOORSTEPS IN THAT ELECTION TIME AND AGAIN IT WAS DAVID CAMERON THAT WAS THERE WAS WINNING THE ARGUMENT I SHOULD BE ON TIME AND YOU'RE ESTIMATING LOST THAT MANDATE SURELY YESTERDAY
BUT HE PUT THE QUESTION TO THE PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM THAT'S THE POINT OF THE REFERENDUM THAT IT IT'S THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT MAKE THE DECISION ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE'LL ACCEPT THAT DECISION IN ADVANCE OF THE RESULT LAST NIGHT I'M SURE THAT HE IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE US THROUGH THE NEGOTIATE COS THEY SAID IT VANISHINGLY STRANGE TO SAY TO SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS HER POSITION IN THE DEW
WHOLEHEARTEDLY OPPOSED WHO WENT THROUGH EUROPE SENT TO EUROPE EFFECTIVELY BY YOU WE EURO SCEPTICS TO NEGOTIATE RE NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH EUROPE FAILED TO DO THAT TO YOUR SATISFACTION AT LEAST CAME BACK HAVING FAILED YOU'RE NOW GOING TO SAY TO HIM NOW WE WANT YOU THE MAN WHO FAILED
YOU GO BACK INTO EUROPE AND TRY AGAIN ODD ISN'T IT I DON'T SEE THAT AS ODD AT ALL HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR ON MANY OCCASIONS IN THE PAST THE POLICE THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM COULD BE A SUCCESS OUTSIDE THE ALL RIGHT NOBODY BELIEVES IT'S WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF ACHIEVING
HE IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE ACHIEVING A GOOD DEAL IN OUR EXIT NEGOTIATIONS FROM EUROPE IT'S IT'S FAILING EUROPEAN UNION WELL DEALING WITH US BUT BUT HE FAILED WHEN HE HAD A MIGHTY POWERFUL WEAPON AT HIS DISPOSAL AND THAT WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT BRITAIN MIGHT LEAD BE YOUR OPINION WILL KNOW BRITAIN HASELEY DIONNE OPINION SO HE NO LONGER HAS THAT WEAPON HE'S EVEN WEAKER THAN HE WENT THE LAST TIME
WELL LAST TIME RONNIE GOT SOME HELPFUL CONCESSIONS BUT IT WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT DIDN'T DELIVER RADICAL CHANGE I THINK THAT THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT THAT WE WILL GET A GOOD TRADE DEAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DELIVERING IT WITH THE SAME CABINET BEHIND HIM WITH ALL THE OLD FACES IN PLACE THE PEOPLE WHOSE ARGUMENT
HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY I THINK THAT THIS IS A TIME FOR FOR UNITY AND THAT GOES FOR BOTH WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND WITHIN THE COUNTRY THIS IS A HUGELY BIG STEPS THAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE AS A COUNTRY I THINK NOW IS TO BE DRAWING ON SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE SO THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD IN A WAY WHICH PROVIDES REASSURANCE TO THOSE ON THE REMAINED SIDE
AND TAKES US FORWARD IN IN A WAY WHICH ENSURES THAT WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT SHOULD THAT MEAN SHOULDN'T MEAN TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY WHICH WOULD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF ART
DEPARTURE SHOULD IT MEAN TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY PRETTY MUCH IMMEDIATELY WELL I I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO RUSH INTO THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY YOU TEND TO GET EXCLUDED FROM A LOT OF CRUCIAL MEETING SO I THINK CERTAINLY THERE WOULD BE A CASE FOR WAITING FOR A PERIOD IN CARRYING OUT INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE NO ON FOREVER THAT THEY COULDN'T IT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT SAY WELL WE LIKE A BIT OF THIS AND WOULD LIKE A BIT OF THAT AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER I COULD GO ON FOREVER
THEY COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE SOME TIME BUT BY THE TIME MEANING MONTHS YUNUS WELL MICHAEL GO SUGGESTED IT COULD TAKE AS LONG AS FIVE YEARS I THINK WE WOULD WANT COMPLETED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE RUSHED IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROCESS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES WE WILL HAVE UNDERTAKEN FORTY WELL INDEED AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT WAS MADE TIME AGAIN DURING THE CAMPAIGN WHICH MANY PEOPLE SO THAT'S WHY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS
TO BE COMPLETELY WHAT I'M ASKING IS WHEN WE SHOULD BEGIN THAT BUGS AS WHEN WE SHOULD TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WELL I THINK WE SHOULD BEGIN A PERIOD OF INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS VERY SOON BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULDN'T SET A DATE TODAY ON EXACTLY WHEN WE WOULD TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY THERE'S NO NEED TO DO THAT AND THEN WHAT
WHAT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO LOOK WE ARE WE'RE AT THE SITUATION AT THE MOMENT WE ARE WE ARE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SCUM'S GOT SAVE ME BEALE NEARLY SURVEYED ALL THIS IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WHEN HE COMES OUT IF HE COMES OUT WE WERE KEEPING AN EYE ON NUMBER TEN THAT THE DOOR IS STILL FIRMLY CLOSED
BUT IF HE SAYS I INTEND TO
CARRY ON THESE NEGOTIATIONS MYSELF WITH THE SAME TEAM THAT I'VE HEARD YOU'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH THAT WOULD YOU YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE FOR INSTANCE BORIS JOHNSON PLAYING A BIGGER PART IN IT MICHAEL GOLD PLAYING A BIGGER I I'D BE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER THAT FOLLOWING THE TEAM YOU WOULD WAIT A MINUTE I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER IS WALKING OUT OF THE DOOR HE'S GOING TO THE LEK AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
THE COUNTRY HAS JUST TAKEN PART IN A GIANT DEMOCRATIC EXERCISE PERHAPS THE BIGGEST IN OUR HISTORY
OVER THIRTY THREE MILLION PEOPLE FROM ENGLAND SCOTLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND AND GIBRALTAR HAVE ALL HAD THEIR SAY
WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IN THESE ISLANDS WE TRUST THE PEOPLE WITH THESE BIG DECISION
WE NOT ONLY HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY BUT ON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HOW WE'RE GOVERNED THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS RIGHT TO ASK THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WILL MUST BE RESPECTED
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO TOOK PART IN THE CAMPAIGN ON MY SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT INCLUDING ALL THOSE WHO PUT PUT ASIDE PARTY DIFFERENCES TO SPEAK IN WHAT THEY BELIEVED WAS THE NATIONAL INTEREST
LET ME CONGRATULATE ALL THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN FOR THEIR SPIRITED AND PASSIONATE CASE THAT THEY MADE
THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IS AN INSTRUCTION THAT MUST BE DELIVERED IT WAS NOT A DECISION THAT WAS TAKEN LIGHTLY NOT LEAST BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS WERE SAID BY SO MANY DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DECISION
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE RESULT
ACROSS THE WORLD PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE CHOICE THAT BRITAIN HAS MADE
I WOULD REASSURE THOSE MARKETS AND INVESTORS THAT BRITAIN'S ECONOMY IS FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG
AND I WOULD ALSO REASSURE BRITS LIVING IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND EUROPEAN CITIZENS LIVING HERE THAT THERE WILL BE NO IMMEDIATE CHANGES IN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THERE'LL BE NO INITIAL CHANGE IN THE WAY OUR PEOPLE CAN TRAVEL IN THE WAY OUR GOODS CAN MOVE ALL THE WAY OUR SERVICES CAN BE SOLVED WE MUST NOW PREPARE FOR A NEGOTIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
THIS WILL NEED TO INVOLVE THE FULL ENGAGEMENT OF THE SCOTTISH WELSH AND NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT
TO ENSURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF ALL PARTS OF A UNITED KINGDOM ARE PROTECTED AND ADVANCE
BUT ABOVE ALL THIS WILL REQUIRE STRONG DETERMINED AND COMMITTED LEADERSHIP
I'M VERY PROUD AND VERY HONOURED TO HAVE BEEN PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY FOR SIX YEARS I BELIEVE WE'VE MADE GREAT STEPS WITH MORE PEOPLE IN WORK THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY WITH REFORMS TO WELFARE AND EDUCATION INCREASING PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES BUILDING A BIGGER AND STRONGER SOCIETY
KEEPING OUR PROMISES TO THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
AND ENABLING THOSE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER TO GET MARRIED WHATEVER THEIR SEXUALITY
BUT ABOVE ALL RESTORING BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND I'M GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE WHO'S HELPED TO MAKE THAT
I'VE ALSO ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT WE HAVE TO CONFRONT BIG DECISIONS NOT DUCK
THAT IS WHY WE DELIVERED THE FIRST COALITION GOVERNMENT IN SEVENTY YEARS TO BRING OUR ECONOMY BACK FROM THE BRINK
IT'S WHY WE DELIVERED A LEGAL AND DECISIVE REFERENDUM IN SCOTT
AND IT'S WHY I MADE THE PLEDGE TO RENEGOTIATE BRITAIN'S POSITION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE HOLD THE REFERENDUM ON OUR MEMBERSHIP AND HAVE CARRIED THOSE THINGS
I THOUGHT THIS CAMPAIGN IN THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HAVE WHICH IS TO SAY IT DIRECTLY AND PASSIONATELY WHAT I THINK AND FEEL
HEAD HEART AND SOUL I HELP NOTHING
I WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT MY BELIEF THAT BRITAIN IS STRONGER SAFER AND BETTER OFF INSIDE THE EUROPEAN
AND I MADE CLEAR THE REFERENDUM WAS ABOUT THIS AND THIS
NOT THE FUTURE OF ANY SINGLE POLITICIAN INCLUDING MYSELF
BUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MADE A VERY CLEAR DECISION TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH
AND AS SUCH I THINK THE COUNTRY REQUIRES FRESH LEADERSHIP TO TAKE IT IN THIS DIRECTION
I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS PRIME MINISTER TO STEADY THE SHIP OVER THE COMING WEEKS
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR ME TO TRY TO BE THE CAPTAIN
THAT STEERS A COUNTRY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION
THIS IS NOT A DECISION I'VE TAKEN LIGHTLY BUT I DO BELIEVE IT'S IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO HAVE A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND THEN THE NEW LEADERSHIP REQUIRED
THERE IS NO NEED FOR A PRECISE TIMETABLE TODAY BUT IN MY VIEW WE SHOULD AIM TO HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE BY THE START OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER DELIVERING STABILITY WILL BE IMPORTANT AND I WILL CONTINUE IN POST AS PRIME MINISTER WITH MY CABINET FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS
THE CABINET WILL MEET ON MONDAY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT THE STEPS THAT THE BANK AND THE TREASURY ARE TAKING TO REASSURE FINANCIAL MARKETS
WE WERE ALSO CONTINUE TAKING FORWARD THE IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT WE SET BEFORE PARLIAMENT IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH
AND I'VE SPOKEN TO HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN THIS MORNING FOR ADVISE HER OF THE STEPS THAT I'M TAKING THE NEGOTIATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL NEED TO BEGIN UNDER A NEW PRIME MINISTER
AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT THIS NEW PRIME MINISTER TAKES THE DECISION ABOUT WHEN TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AND START THE FORMAL AND LEGAL PROCESS OF LEAVING THE E.U.
I WILL ATTEND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL NEXT WEEK TO EXPLAIN THE DECISION THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN AND MY OWN DECISION THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MADE A CHOICE
THAT NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE RESPECTED BUT THOSE ON THE LOSING SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT MYSELF INCLUDED SHOULD HELP TO MAKE IT WORK
BRITAIN IS A SPECIAL COUNTRY WE HAVE SO MANY GREAT ADVANTAGES A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY WHERE WE RESOLVE GREAT ISSUES ABOUT OUR FUTURE THROUGH PEACEFUL DEBATE A GREAT TRADING NATION WITH A SCIENCE AND HEARTS ARE ENGINEERING AND OUR CREATIVITY RESPECTED THE WORLD OVER
AND WHILE WE ARE NOT PERFECT I DO BELIEVE WE CAN BE A MODEL OF A MULTI RACIAL MULTI FAITH DEMOCRACY
WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND MAKE A CONTRIBUTION AND RISE TO THE VERY HIGHEST THAT THAT TALENT
ALTHOUGH LEAVING EUROPE WAS NOT THE PATH I RECOMMENDED I'M THE FIRST TO PRAISE OUR INCREDIBLE STRENGTH
I SAID BEFORE THAT BRITAIN CAN SURVIVE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INDEED THAT WE COULD FIND A WAY
THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO LEAVE WE NEED TO FIND THE BEST WAY AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND I FEEL HONOURED TO HAVE SERVED
AND I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN IN FUTURE TO HELP THIS GREAT COUNTRY SUCCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS HE IS NOW WALKING BACK INTO DOWNING STREET WITH HIS WIFE SAMANTHA AND IF YOU HAVE JUST JOINED US WHAT HE SAID IN PART WAS THE COUNTRY REQUIRES FRESH LEADERSHIP
IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO BE THE CAPTAIN TO STEAL US TO THEIR NEXT DESTINATION A NEW PRIME MINISTER
MUST BE IN PLACE BY OCTOBER SO THAT HE'S ANSWERED MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING THROUGHOUT THIS PROGRAMME I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO AS WELL AS BEING JOINED BY TWO REASONABLE AS THE NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY BY MICHAEL FALLON THE DEFENCE SECRETARY TO MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET AND WE WERE TALKING TO YOU EARLIER THERESA VILLIERS LET ME JUST ASK YOU WHAT YOU MADE OF THAT I THINK ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL HIS VOICE BROKE AT THE END OF THAT
SPEECH AND HE WAS CLEARLY DEEPLY EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S TRULY SHOCKING NEW SIZE I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S DEEPLY SAD I'VE AS I WAS JUST SAYING AND IF YOU MINUTES AGO RIGHT
WOULD VERY MUCH HAVE PREFERRED DAVID CAMERON TO BE STEERING THIS COUNTRY THROUGH THE NEXT FEW YEARS SITE ENTIRELY OBVIOUSLY RESPECT HIS DECISION BUT I THINK IT'S A SAD DAY FOR THE COUNTRY THAT HE HAS DECIDED TO RUN TO STAND DOWN
MICHAEL FALLON LET ME ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION IF I MAY WHAT OF COURSE IT'S EXTREMELY SAD NEWS I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED HIM TO HAVE STAYED ON AND TO HELP MAKE THIS DECISION WORK BUT IT'S HIS DECISION AND I THINK HE FEELS IT'S THE HONOURABLE THING TO DO THE DECENT THING TO DO HE LOST THE ARGUMENT IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND HE DOES ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS TO WHO IS BEST PLACED TO TAKE THIS RENEGOTIATION FORWARD
WHO SHOULD THAT BE WELL THAT'S A MATTER FOR THE PARTY TO ELECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER TO BE IN PLACE FOR THE AUTUMN AND TO TAKE THAT FORWARD SO I THINK IT'S A BIT TOO EARLY TO START SPECULATING ABOUT THAT AND THERE IS PLENTY TO DO NOW TO HELP MAKE THIS DECISION WORK TO STABILISE OUR ECONOMY TO REASSURE OUR ALLIES AND TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAMME WE WERE ALL ELECTED ON LAST YEAR WHAT IS THE PROCESS NOW
THE PROCESS NOW IS THE PARTY WILL HAVE TO SELECT A NEW LEADER THAT MEANS THE M.P.S WILL SELECT THE FINAL TWO THOSE TWO THEN GO OUT TO THE
TO THE MEMBERSHIP AND THE MEMBERSHIP WILL DECIDE I GUESS AT SOME POINT IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE PRECISE TIMETABLE WILL WILL EMERGE I THINK IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND JUST TAKE US THROUGH THAT PROCEDURE IF YOU WOULD THE ELECTION PROCEDURE THE ELECTION PROCEDURE LAST TIME WAS THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND PUT THEIR NAMES FORWARD AND PARLIAMENT PARLIAMENT REFINES THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES DOWN TO THE FINAL TWO SAYS THEY'D BE HAPPY TO SERVE BEHIND EITHER OF THEM AND THEN THE PARTY IN THE COUNTRY HAS A VOTE AND DECIDES WHO THAT LEADER SHOULD BE
AND THAT WILL PRESUMABLY TAKE PLACE IN SEPTEMBER AND CLEARLY SOME OF THE NAMES ARE ONE OF THE NAMES THERE BORIS JOHNSON WE KNOW WILL BE THERE AT LEAST WE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT WE ASSUMED THAT HIS NAME WILL BE AMONGST THEM
PRESUMABLY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY OTHER OTHER NAMES THAT YOU PERHAPS WOULD EXPECT WELL THERE ARE PLENTY OF NAMES THAT HAVE BEEN BANDED AROUND IN THAT IS THERE THAT IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY BUT THERE IS PLENTY TO BE DONE BEFORE WE GET TO THAT STAGE AND I THINK WITH RESPECT JOHN IT'S A IT'S A VERY
TO BE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE'S GOING TO STAND A VERY EARLY TO START DADO HAVE GOT BETTING ON WHO IS GOING TO SUCCEED IN MY BIG INEVITABLY I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS THAT WE REASSURE THE COUNTRY WE HELP TO STABILISE THE MARKETS IN THE ECONOMY WE REASSURE OUR ALLIES THE BRITAIN IS NOT TURNING ITS BACK ON THE WORLD I WAS TALKING TO BE MEMBERS OF NATO AND CONTINUE OUR PART IN THE COALITION AGAINST THE DASH AND WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION
TO MAKE IT WORK AND DO OUR BEST FOR THE COUNTRY STAY WITH US IF YOU WOULD JUST A MOMENT BECAUSE WE EXPECT TO BE HERE FROM THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND SIR BUT UNTIL WE DO SO LET'S BRING IN THE S.N.P. HIS FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN IN WESTMINSTER ALEX SAM AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING YOU WILL HAVE HEARD THE STATEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER THE NEWS THAT HE HAS RESIGNED AND EXPECTS A NEW LEADER A NEW PRIME MINISTER TO BE IN PLACE BY OCTOBER WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO IT
WELL IT WAS INEVITABLE I DON'T EVEN LIKE SOME OTHERS I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN THIS POSITION OF BEING THE FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND WHO ORGANISED THE REFERENDUM TOOK MY CASE TO THE PEOPLE ARE LOST AND YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY CONTINUE IN OFFICE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND LEVEL HAD A SYMPTOM UP OF
A BACK SUPPORT WOULD BE FOLLOWED VERY SWIFTLY BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION AND INCIDENTALLY THAT THE CHANCELLOR AND MAKE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO US SOME ONLY A FEAST OF OPPOSITION OF ING NO CREDIBILITY WHATSOEVER IF YOU TAKE YOUR CASE TO THE COUNTRY IN A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE AND YOU LOSE
THEN THERE IT'S ONLY ONE COURSE TO TAKE A MATCH TO RESIGN AND I LOATHE THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO MANDY AND ONE PUTS THE RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND TO GO FORWARD AND TAKE FORWARD THAT MIGHT BE IT THAT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF WHAT ELSE CHANGES YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS MORNING I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE THE TRIGGER FOR A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM TO SCOTT
WHEN I KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLAND WHO ENTERED WE WILL EMERGE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS THE WORKING POLITICIAN WHO HAS RECEIVED A MANDATE FROM HER PEOPLE THEY ALL EVERY SINGLE LOCAL AUTHORITY IN SCOTLAND VOTED REMAIN THEY FOLLOWED THE LEADER OF THE FIRST MINISTER I'M SHOULD NICOLA STURGEON
WILL IMPLEMENT THE S.N.P. MANIFESTO AND WHAT SHE WAS ELECTED THE FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE VOTE JUST LAST MONTH THAT THE BIGGEST MAN BIT OF ANY GOVERNING PARTY IN WESTERN EUROPE AND THAT WAS TO SEE IT'S A SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL THE REFERENDUM UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SCOTLAND
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST THE WILL OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE UNPLUGGED THIS YOU'RE THE FOOT OF ENGLAND WAS SIX PER CENT THAT'S OF ENGLAND BETWEEN LEVEN REMAIN A SIX PER CENT VICTORY FOR LEAVE IN SCOTLAND THERE WAS A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT VICTORY FOUR REMAIN
ENCOMPASSING EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE COUNTRY YOU COULDN'T GET O. KAY OUGHT TO SAY SIR MANDY AT THE MAP SO WHEN YOU LOOK AHEAD IN THE SHORT TIME THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE'S THE PRIME MINISTER MAKE CLEAR IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR HIM TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY THE PROCESS
EFFECTIVELY THE NEGOTIATION START IT WILL BE DOWN TO THE WHOEVER TAKES OVER FROM HIM SO THAT WILL BE OCTOBER AT THE EARLIEST THAT IS A PROCESS THAT'S MEANT TO TAKE NO MORE THAN TWO YEARS DOES THAT MEAN ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS
WHEN THE PROCESS STARTS I THINK PROBABLY NO TALKING WILL FLICK TALK A BIT OF PRIME MINISTER GAVE US AND WHATEVER PAIN THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TAKES TO TRIGGER OF ARTICLE FIFTY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEAR TIME SKILL WHAT SEE THAT'S ROUGHLY THAT YES IT WOULD BE WERE FROM THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO COME OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION GO BACK IN
WHAT WOULD SEEK TO DO THIS TO REMAIN WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT BECAUSE STARVED AND OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS STARTING OFF AT THE NEXT OVER WILL OUTLINE EXACTLY HOPE THINKING A STRATEGY AND SHE WILL UM OUCH
MY MY HOPES ON THIS AS THE ONE POLITICIAN RECEIVING A MAN WHOSE THOUGHT THESE THINGS THROUGH AND WILL OFFER A CLEAR AND THE SEIS OF LEADERSHIP TO THE PEOPLE AT THIS VITAL TRADE ALEX SALMOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND TO MAKE A STATEMENT LET'S HAVE A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES THE PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL RESIGN AFTER THE U.K. VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SPEAKING IN DOWNING STREET HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE BY OCTOBER AND IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR HIM TO BE THE CAPTAIN THAT STEER THE COUNTRY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION HE SAID THE NEGOTIATIONS WOULD REQUIRE STRONG COMMITTED LEADERSHIP AND HE WAS PROUD TO HAVE SERVED AS PRIME MINISTER FOR SIX YEARS AT THE END AS HIS VOICE STARTED TO BREAK HE SAID HE'D DO EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD TO HELP THIS GREAT COUNTRY SUCCEED
EVERY REGION IN ENGLAND BY A LONDON CAME OUT IN FAVOUR OF SEVERING TIES WITH THE E.U. IN WALES SEVENTEEN OF THE TWENTY TWO AREAS BANK LEAVE IN SCOTLAND BY CONTRAST ALL THIRTY TWO AREAS BACK REMAIN NORTHERN IRELAND ALSO VOTED TO STAY IN BY A MARGIN OF NEARLY TWELVE PER CENT
THE POUND HAS FALLEN FURTHER THAN IT DID DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION AND AFTER THE U.K. PULLED OUT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM REACHING THE LOW NOT SEEN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID IT WOULD TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONETARY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX HAS FALLEN BY SEVEN PERCENT
AND WE ARE STILL JOINED IN THE STUDIO ABOUT TO REASONABLE AS THE NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY UNDER THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON NO WE'VE HAD AT LEAST A FOR A MOMENT OR TWO TO CONSIDER WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID I DON'T THINK YOU WERE EXPECTING IT EITHER OF YOU WERE YOU TERESA BELIEVES NO ABSOLUTELY NOT I AS I SAY I THINK IS A VERY SAD DAY I WISH THE PRIME MINISTER HAD STAYED ON I UNDERSTAND HIS DECISION BUT I'M VERY SORRY HE FELT HE HAD TO MAKE IT
AND HUMANS FUNNEL WHEELS BACON YOU KNOW I WAS HOPING IT WOULD STAY ON I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD A COUNTRY THROUGH BUT HE'S TAKEN THE DECISION I THINK IT'S AN HONOURABLE DECISION BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE JUST BE REFERENDUM WENT AGAINST HIM AND NOW WE MUST ALL PULL TOGETHER AND MAKE IT WORK AND HAS A HUGE JOB TO BE DONE NOT SOME PEOPLE IN THE PARTY TOGETHER BUT PUTTING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER
WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE END TILTED HIM TO DO THAT DO YOU THINK PERHAPS THAT WAS ALWAYS HIS INTENTION OR MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN HAS A RESULT OF THE WAY THE VOTE WHEN TAKE IT IN THE LAST IN THE CLOSING HOURS DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA DO YOU THINK AS YOU KNOW THEM QUITE WELL AND I WANT YOU WONDER WHETHER HE WAS THINKING OF SEVERAL HOURS AGO THAT HE DO IT OR SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS AGO THAT HE'D DO IT IF THE WORK WENT THAT WAY
WELL I'VE BEEN WITH HIM SEVERAL POINTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND HE THREW EVERYTHING INTO THIS CAMPAIGN HE WAS ABSOLUTELY PASSIONATE HAVING CARRIED OUT THEIR RENEGOTIATION HE WAS PASSIONATE THAT A PLACE DOES LIE WITHIN A REFORMED EUROPEAN UNION ANY THREW EVERYTHING INTO THAT AND I GUESS HE FELT THAT THE DECISION HAVING GONE AGAINST HIM THAT HE HAD TO RESPECT THAT
BUT WITH I WOULD SAY WITH THE HEAVY HARD OBVIOUSLY HE WANTED THE VOTE TO GO THE OTHER WAY BUT HE'D ALREADY EAST SET HAVEN'T IS THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO RUN FOR ANOTHER TURN AN OFFICE WE'D EXPECTED HIM NOT TO BE WITH US FOR MORE THAN WELL WHO KNOWS A PERIOD OF A COUPLE OF YEARS HE WAS HE WAS MONROE AGAIN
HE'D SAID HE WAS GOING TO SERVE THE FULL TERM OF THE PARLIAMENT SO WE EXPECTED HIM TO BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS HE'S BEEN PRIME MINISTER FOR SIX YEARS I THINK YOU'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT REFORMING PRIME MINISTERS HAS DONE A HUGE AMOUNT TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD AS HE DESCRIBED IN HIS STATEMENT
AND THE PROCESS AND WE KNOW THAT ARTICLE FIFTY IS NOT GOING TO BE INVOKED AT LEAST UNTIL WE HAVE A LOOK AT LEAST I'M NOT QUITE SURE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING THAT THAT IT WILL NOT BE INVOKED UNTIL WE HAVE A NEW MAN IN PLACE A NEW BUS I BEG YOUR PARDON A NEW LEADER IN PLACE YES I THINK THERESA VILLIERS WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT WE SHOULDN'T RUSH INTO ARTICLE FIFTY NOTIFICATION
IT'S A FAIRLY ABSTRUSE SUBJECT AN ARTICLE FIFTEEN THE WAY IT WORKS AND OF COURSE NO NO BIG COUNTRIES LEFT THE EUROPEAN IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO SO THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF VERY CAREFUL THOUGHT ON OUR SIDE AND INDEED ON THE SIDE OF OUR PARTNERS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY AND SO ON BECAUSE WHATEVER THE DECISION EUROPE ARE STILL THERE IT'S STILL AROUND FORTY PERCENT OF OUR TRADE YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE EXACT NUMBERS AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE WORK I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE ON THAT
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT A NEGOTIATION OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND JUST BE QUITE CLEAR NOTHING CAN HAPPEN IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH YOUR NOTHING CAN HAPPEN UNTIL
THAT ARTICLE HAS BEEN ABOUT IN OTHER WORDS UNTIL THE PROCEDURE HAS BEEN THE GUN WE CAST CAN'T THINK ABOUT SIGNING NEW TREATIES OR DOING WHAT WE GO ON AS WE GO ON AS MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE MOMENT DAVID CAMERON WILL BE ATTENDING THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEETING NEXT TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY IN BRUSSELS WE GO ON HAVING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THERE'S NO NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO BE LIVING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO PANIC OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE GO ON WITH ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS AND ADVANTAGES THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT
AND MICHAEL FALLON THERESA VILLIERS THANK YOU BOTH WE'VE GOT YES IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE WELL OF COURSE WE SAW DRAMATIC MARKET REACTIONS TO THE NEWS THAT BRITAIN HAD VOTED TO LEAVE THAT THE U.K. HAD VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW OF COURSE WE HAVE THE NEWS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS RESIGNED DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS ON A TRADING FLOOR TRADING FOR OF YOU S. IN THE CITY AND DOMINIC WHAT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO YES IT'S BEEN AN ASTONISHING MORNING IN THE CITY YOU HEARD OVERNIGHT HOW THE POUND FELL DRAMATICALLY THE SAME THING'S HAPPENED TO SHEARS NOW THAT THE MARKETS HAVE OPENED THERE PUT TO ONE HUNDRED STARTED AT SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ODD HAS PLUMS FROM THE SIX THOUSAND BARRIER
IT'S TRADING ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT DOWN THAT'S ROUGHLY ON A PAR WITH THE WORST DAY IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS IS NOW FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE SOME BIG MOVEMENTS AND THAT THE BIG HOUSE POOL DONE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT INDIVIDUAL BANK SPARK CLAY'S B'S DONE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS SMOOTHIES HAS PUT THE U.K. ON A NEGATIVE WATCH FOR ITS CREDIT RATING I'M JOINED BY KAREN ONLY HIT A FANATICALLY EQUITIES FOR YOU CAN YOU WERE JUST WATCHING DAVID CAMERON RESIGN WHAT WAS FOR ME ON THE FLOOR
MURDER ON OUR FLOOR WAS VERY SOMBRE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE IN SHOCK AND THEY REALISE THAT THIS IS GOING TO SET IN OVER DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS WE REALLY ARE IN A WORLD OF UNCERTAINTY AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT'S THAT IT'S JUST TRY AND PUT A NUMBER WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE VALUE OF THE FOOTY ONE HUNDRED IN THE END THE LAST HALF HOUR WHILE LITERALLY TWO HUNDRED BILLION HAS BEEN WIPED OUT OF U.K. STOCKS ON OPENING TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES INTO OPENING BUT SOME ASTONISHING ABOUT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE
WELL OBVIOUSLY THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WAS VERY SEVERE BUT I THINK THIS IS DIFFERENT WE THOUGHT WE PUT THOSE DAYS BEHIND US AND IF YOU LOOK AT A NUMBER OF THINGS YOU BUY FOR PROTECTION WHETHER IT BE A BARN DOOR WORK SET HER UP THOSE ARE AS EXPENSIVE NOW AS THEY WERE IN JULY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE PEAK OF THE EURO CRISIS SO WE HAVE NOT YET GOT OURSELVES OUT OF CRISIS MODE MARKETS TYPICALLY OVERREACT TO BAD NEWS PEOPLE GET VERY JUMPY DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF US BEING UNWELL AND DURING THE DAY AND THE FOOTY BOUNCING BACK
VERY DIFFERENT I MEAN THIS IS FORTY FIFTY YEARS HISTORY BEING UNWOUND REVERSED YOU'VE GOT A FOOTBALL CLUB THAT'S JUST LOST ONE OF ITS KEY VALUED PLAYERS WHICH IS THE U.K. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE E.U. GOING FORWARD WE DON'T KNOW AND IT'S WORTH NOTING WHICH WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED THE U.K. MARKETS BUT REALLY IT'S ALSO A EUROPEAN AND A WORLD WIDE STORY THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE MARKETS ACROSS THE WORLD
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST FEW MONTHS WHEN WE'RE GETTING NERVOUS ABOUT HER LEAVE YOU SAW A EUROPEAN BANKS DOWN ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH AS U.K. BANKS YOU SAW THE EAST DOCKS FIFTY DOWN THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SO THEY'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE AND WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR THE FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED IS JUST A NUMBER TO IT TO AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE VALUE OF OUR RETIREMENT PLANS OUR PENSIONS LOTS OF THINGS HANG OFF A STONE
YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT WAS A VOTE MADE PERHAPS WAS NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION AND BAD COMMUNICATION BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A COST TO THE AVERAGE PERSON I THINK G.D.P. GROWTH OF SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH YOU HAD MAYBE RISK OF HIGHER INFLATION HOLIDAYS COST MORE I THINK IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO KIND OF GET THROUGH THIS AND JUST TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE AGREEMENTS
THERE ARE THOUSANDS PROBABLY THAT NEED TO BE RENEGOTIATED THIS ISN'T DONE OVERNIGHT WE DON'T NO ONE REALLY HAS A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE U.K. IN THE E.U. WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE NEXT YEAR SO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND MARKETING YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE FOR QUITE A WHILE
YEAH I MEAN OF COURSE THINGS OVERREACT AND PASSIONS RUN HIGH INITIALLY BUT I DON'T SEE A QUICK FIX WHEN WE HAD THE EURO CRISIS DRUGGIE STEPPED IN AND SAID I'LL SAVE THE GIRL IT WAS A QUICK FIX I DON'T REALLY SEE A QUICK FIX TO THIS I THINK MOST OF THE M.P.S WHERE THEY VOTED FOR ECZEMA OR NOT
THE BLACKS THAT ARE NOT PROBABLY DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK THEY WERE GOING TO GET ONE WE'RE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM MARK CARNEY FAIRLY SHORTLY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM HER
OUR BELIEF IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME POTENTIAL CUTS IN INTEREST RATES AND SOME MORE QUANTITATIVE EASING R. E. THEY CANNOT AND PURCHASE SOME ASSETS WE DO NOT THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO NEGATIVE DEPOSIT RATES WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE E.U. AND REALLY HURTS THE BANKS SO IT'S YOUR YOUR CENTRAL US ON YOUR BASIC ASSUMPTION WAS A CARNY WILL HAVE TO CUT INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
NOT THAT HE'LL HAVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO DIFFER INSTILLED THAT IS A TOUGH QUESTION THERE'S ONLY ONE OR TWO CUTS TO GO BUT ONE OF THE FEARS AND IT'S A WAY OUT THERE IS AN OUTLIER IS SOME SORT OF STAGFLATION WHERE THE CURRENCY FALLS FURTHER AND WE NEED TO INCREASE RATES
THAT WOULD BE BAD NEWS FOR BANKS PROPERTY EXCEPT ARRGH SO THERE'S THIS IDEA OF STAGFLATION WAS THAT EVERYTHING HAS CAUGHT IN A BIT OF A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND THINGS JUST GET WORSE HE HAS LOW GROWTH AND YOU HAVE INFLATION SO THE WORST OF TWO EVILS EXACTLY ALSO CANNOT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT CITY EMPLOYMENT J.P. MORGAN THIS MORNING JAMIE DIAMOND CENTRE WHICH IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANK JAMIE DIAMOND IN A MEMO TO EMPLOYEES TALKING ABOUT RESTRUCTURING AT THE EUROPEAN OPERATIONS
THE PARTIES TALKED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND JOBS MOVING OUT OF THE U.K. THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S MINDS TODAY'S IN THERE BECAUSE THE CITY EXISTS IS SO STRONG IN PART BECAUSE HE'S ABLE TO SELL AT SERVICES INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE ODD THING IS NOT NECESSARILY WE'VE GOT TWO YEARS YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND YOU'VE GOT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE TRADING ARRANGEMENTS CHANGE
SO WITH BANKS AND PASSPORT IN RIGHTS INTO THE E.U. IN YOUR ABILITY TO SELF ON THE U.K. INTO THE E.U. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE I THINK BANKS ARE GOING TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY MOVES BUT THE POINT IS THE BANKS THEMSELVES AND A SECTOR TEAMS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT KIND OF PAST PUTTING RIGHT CAN EXIST DOWN THE ROAD ALL OF THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE RENEGOTIATED THE PROBLEM AS MOST OF THE TRADE NEGOTIATORS ARE SITTING IN BRUSSELS
IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS OR A CHANCE PERHAPS AT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WON'T WANT TO WAIT
BUT BUSINESS MOVES ON THEY WILL NOT WANT TO WAIT TWO YEARS THEY MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE THE SOUNDS QUITE QUICKLY I THINK I MEAN WHAT WE'VE LEARNT IT'S NOT REALLY A HORSEY OF OPERATIONS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT THE SYSTEM SET UP IN MANY COUNTRIES TO TAKE THAT KIND OF A BIG MOVE BACK OFFICERS EXCEPT THAT BIT BY BIT YOU'LL BE SETTING UP SORT OF LARGER OPERATIONS IN SOMEBODY'S COUNTRIES I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A HORSE ON MOVE OVERNIGHT
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT UNCERTAINTIES A BAD THING BUT WHAT BANKS WON'T WANT TO DO IS MOVE EVERYTHING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO SPAIN OR GERMANY OR SOMETHING AND REALISE ACTUALLY RULES HAVE BEEN SOFTENED AND WE HEARD WE HEARD JUST EERIE BUT MOODY'S HAVE PUT THE U.K. A NEGATIVE WATCH THEY JUST PUT UP THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WE EXPECT SOMETHING SIMILAR FROM THE OTHER BE CREDIT RATING AGENCY STANDARD AND POURS HIS EXPLAIN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY MEAN TO THE U.K.'S FINANCES TO AS PUBLIC FINANCES WILL IT JUST MEANS THE COST OF MONEY HAS GONE UP
IF YOU'VE GOT SORT OF HIGHER RISK RATING ON YOUR DEBT IT COULD BE THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTEREST RATE MAY GO UP SLIGHTLY IT COULD EVEN IF IT GETS MUCH IF WE GET SIGNIFICANT OUR CARRIES ON INTO THE FUTURE COULD MEAN HIGHER COST OF MORTGAGE RATES
EXCELLENT THANK YOU MUCH CASUALLY IF OF U.B.S. THANK YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOMINIC IT'S NOW QUARTER TO NINE AND JUST WAITING ON MARK CARNEY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO MAKE A STATEMENT THERE'S A LINE UP TO THE BANK AND WE'RE SOON AS WE
HE APPEARS WE WILL GO TO THAT FEED NOW THOUGH AND I CAN SEE THEY'RE SET TO GETTING THE PODIUM EDITOR DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE ANY MINUTE BUT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE HAD THIS NEWS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS RESIGNED HE WILL GO IN OCTOBER HE WANTS A NEW PERSON IN PLACE BY THEN AND LET'S BRING IN STEVE HILTON WHO OF COURSE WAS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF HIS AND WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM STEVE HILTON WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO HIS DECISION WHAT I WHAT
AND I THINK THAT IT REMINDED US THAT IS AMAZING
I'VE ARGUED ALL ALONG THAT WHATEVER THE OUTCOME HE SHOULD'VE STAYED ON NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO STEADY THE SHIP AS HE
YEAH BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW HIM AND ALEX SALMOND SAID THIS MORNING IT WAS INEVITABLE AND AS DAVID CAMERON SAID HE'S BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS BELIEF HAS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE WAS ADVISING PEOPLE TO DO AND YET THEY CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT
THIS MORNING BUT HE
COUNTRY TREE BELIEVE HER AND I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE MARK CARNEY SPEAKING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AND ADJUSTMENT FOLLOWING THIS RESULT BUT AS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT JUST THIS MORNING THERE'LL BE NO INITIAL CHANGE IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE CONTROLLER IN THE WAY OUR GOODS CAN MOVE ALL THE WAY OR SOURCES CAN BE
AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME FROM THE KING TO ESTABLISH NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH EUROPE AND THE REST
SOME MARKET AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITY CAN BE EXPECTED AS THIS PROCESS AND FOR
WE ARE WELL PREPARED FOR THIS
HER MAJESTY'S TREASURY AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAVE ENGAGED AND EXTENSIVE CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND THE CHANCELLOR AND I HAVE REMAINED IN CLOSE CONTACT INCLUDING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THERE'S MORE
TO BE CLEAR SIR THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES REQUIRED AS MARKETS
AS THE U.K. ECONOMY WAS FOR THOSE ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE SUPPORTED BY A RESILIENT U.K. FINANCIAL SYSTEM ONE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS CONSISTENTLY STROKED AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS
THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF A LARGEST BANKS NO TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN BEFORE
THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO STRESS TESTED THOSE BAGS AGAINST AN AREAS FAR MORE SUPERIOR THAN A COUNTRY CURRENTLY FACES AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS YOU KEEP PAINTS HAVE RAISED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION POUNDS OF NEW CAPITAL AND NO HELP MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS OF HIGH QUALITY LIQUID
WHAT IS THIS MATTER WELL THAT SUBSTANTIAL CAPEL HUGE WERE QUICKLY GIVES SPACE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEARN TO U.K. BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS EVEN DURING CHALLENGING TIME
MOREOVER AS A BACKSTOP AND TO SUPPORT THE FUNCTION AND MARKETS THE BANK OF ENGLAND STANDS READY TO PROVIDED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION POUNDS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH ITS NORMAL MARKET OPERATIONS THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS ALSO ABLE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL QUICKLY INFORM CURRENCY IF REQUIRED
AND WE EXPECT INSTITUTIONS TO DRAW ON THIS FOLLY IF AND WHEN APPROPRIATE JUST AS WE EXPECT THEM TO DRAW ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES AS NEEDED
NORWICH PROVIDE CREDIT TO SUPPLANT MARKETS
AND TO SUPPLY OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE REALITY
IN THE COMING WEEKS THE BOAT WILL ASSESS ECONOMIC CONDITION
WE WILL CONSIDER ANY ADDITIONAL POLICY RESPONSE
IF YOU WANT TO GO THE BANK JUDGE THAT THE RISKS AROUND THE REFERENDUM WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEAR TURNED DOMESTIC WRIST OF FINANCIAL STABILITY TO MITIGATE THE BANK HAS PUT IN PLACE EXTENSIVE CONTINGENCY
AND HIS PLANS BEGIN WITH ENSURING THAT THE CORE OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM AS WELL CAPITALISED IT'S LIQUID AND DESTROY STRONG
THIS RESILIENCE IS BACKED UP BY THE BAKERY WAS LIQUIDITY FACILITIES IN STIRLING AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES
AND ALL OF THESE RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT ORDERLY MARKET FUNCTIONING IN THE FACE OF ANY SHORTER VOLATILITY
THE BANK WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT AND CO OPERATE WITH ALL RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES
TO ENSURE THAT THE U.K. FINANCIAL SYSTEM CAN ABSORB ANY STRESSES AND COULD DO ITS JOB OF CONCENTRATING ON SERVING THE REALITY
THAT ECONOMY WILL ADJUST TO NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE PUT IN PLACE OR RETIRE
AND IT'S THESE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DECISIONS WHICH WILL DETERMINE THE U.K.'S LONG TERM ECONOMIC PROSPER
THE BEST CONTRIBUTION OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE BEST TELEVISION WE CAN MAKE TO THIS PROCESS USED TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE RELENTLESSLY OUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONITORING FINANCIAL STABILITY
THESE ARE UNCHANGED AND WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PREPARE FOR TODAY'S EVENT
AND IN THE FUTURE WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL MEASURES REQUIRED TO MEET OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A UNITED KINGDOM
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY AND FORGIVE ME STEVE HILTON WE WERE TALKING JUST BEFORE HE APPEARED I INTERRUPTED YOU HE HAS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE JOB TO DO ALONG WITH OTHERS ISN'T JUST TO STABILISE TO REASSURE PEOPLE WE HEARD THE START OF IT THERE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED THERE ISN'T IT AN EXIT IT IS
WE WERE ALL COME TOGETHER BUT SEND A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WE NOW IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE A ALREADY STRONG ECONOMY AND ONE THAT WILL BE EVEN STRONGER IN THE YEARS AHEAD AND THERE WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE WORLD ECONOMICALLY NOW BUT WE HAVE MADE THIS DECISION I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER AND WORK ON BECAUSE THAT'S IN THE INTEREST OF EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S SURELY WHAT
AS STEPHEN HILTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IN THE STUDIO WITH US IS ANNIE MINTON BED IT'S HIS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE ECONOMIST AND THERE'S ALL THAT TALK ABOUT REASSURING BUT WE'VE SEEN TWO HUNDRED BILLION WIPED OFF THE VALUE OF SHARES WE STEAMED STERLING STUMP STUMP TO LEVELS NOT SEEN IN THIRTY YEARS IS WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MARK CARNEY THE SORT OF THING THAT'S GOING TO REASSURE PEOPLE
I THINK MARCONI WAS DOING HIS ABSOLUTE BEST TO DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO WHICH IS TO TRY AND REASSURE PEOPLE I HAVE TO SAY WHEN HE SAID THAT WE WERE FACING A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AND ADJUSTMENT IT WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST UNDERSTATEMENT I'VE HEARD THIS MORNING AND I THINK STEVE HILTON IS RIGHT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER BUT I'M AFRAID I DON'T SHARE HIS OPTIMISM I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY ROCKY PERIOD WE'VE SEEN A HUGE ADJUSTMENT TO FINANCIAL MARKETS THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY I THINK THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO GO FOR PRETTY GRIM PATCH
DANNY MINTON IT'S FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I UNDERSTAND WE'RE JOINED BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH FORMER WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY AND OF COURSE A VERY PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNER GOOD MORNING TO YOU COME ON WE HAD OF COURSE BEEN REASSURED BY THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING THAT THIS SORT OF THING WOULDN'T HAPPEN HUGE VOLATILITY HUGE CHANGES IN THE MARKET
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE VOTE WAS THAT THE MARKET ITSELF BIT AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT WAS ON ANY REMAIN
SUCCESS AND THEREFORE YOU SAW STERLING RISE AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'RE TRYING TO CUT THEIR LOSSES AND THAT'S INEVITABLE AND YOU WILL ALWAYS GET A MOMENT OF INSTABILITY D'YOU EXPECT IT SECOND GUEST ON JUST LISTO WE'RE AND EVERYONE'S ALWAYS ADMIT THERE WOULD BE A SHORT TERM PERIOD OF INSTABILITY BECAUSE THE MARKET WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS SCALE TO WHAT WOULD BE IT WELL I THINK THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS YOU WILL SEE THINGS BEGIN TO STABILISE AGAIN THE BANK OF ENGLAND MADE THAT VERY CLEAR NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH REGARDS TO THE ESSENTIALS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY IT'S RUNNING
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ABILITY TO RIGHT ITSELF ITS RECORD ON THE GROWTH IT'S RECORD ON MONETARY POLICY IT'S RECORD ON EMPLOYMENT ALL THESE THINGS CONTINUE THERE'S NOTHING CHANGING OVERNIGHT WITH REGARDS O.K. RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION SO SO THIS IS THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET'S TRYING TO DO BHANA ROOM OR CELL ON THE FACT AND AT SOME POINT THEY'RE GOING TO DECIDE THAT
STERLING IT'S CHEAPER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE GREATER STABILISATION THE BANK WILL INTERVENE WHEN NESTS OVER THAT IS INVARIABLY THE CASE IN THE SHORT TERM BUT I BELIEVE IN THE MEDIUM TERM WE WILL SEE A MUCH GREATER STATE STABILITY AS WE BEGIN TO PUT TOGETHER THE PLANS FOR HOW NOT ONLY WILL WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE TO BE AFTER WE HAVE LEFT OH KAY HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU HEARD THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING THAT HE WOULD RESIGN
WELL I'M SAD I'M SAD I WASN'T SIGNAGE TO ANY LETTER COS NO ONE OFFERED ME TO THAT I WOULD'VE MADE IT PUBLIC FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THAT I FELT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S DUTY WAS TO STAY AND TO SEE THIS THROUGH BECAUSE HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A MANDATE FROM A YEAR AGO AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE DECISION HE MADE IT CLEAR PUBLICLY THAT HE WOULD CHOOSE TO STAY TO ENSURE THAT HE GOT STABILITY AND THE RIGHT PROCESS GOING AFTER NEGOTIATIONS A DISCUSSION WITH HIS COLLEAGUES
I'M SORRY TO TAKE A DIFFERENT SURGEON BUT OUT THE DID IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING AS ALEC SALMON MADE THE POINT IT'S INEVITABLE AND AS DAVID CAMERON SAID HE WAS HE'S BEEN CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HE BELIEVES AND THAT WHAT IS NEEDED NOW IS FRESH LEADERSHIP TO TAKE IT THAT THAT'S TO TAKE THE COUNTRY IN THE DIRECTION THAT IT WANTS TO GO
I AGREE THAT THAT IS HIS DECISION AND THERE WAS NO POINT IN DISCUSSING IT MUCH FURTHER I'M SORRY HE'S GONE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE PROVIDED THAT LEADERSHIP BUT HE'S PROCESS I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA AND THAT TO MY MIND IS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S SHORT TERM LEADERSHIP NOW WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO ENSURE THAT
THE ESSENTIALS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY ARE STABLE AND THAT THE MARKET'S RECOGNISE THAT AND THAT THIS GETS GREATER STABILITY IN THE MEDIUM TERM FOR US AS WELL SO THAT'S HIS PARTICULAR JOB RIGHT NOW TO DO WHATEVER HE HAS TO DO
TO GET THAT DONE THERE OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL GET A WHOLE SERIES OF PEOPLE I'M SURE AN INTERNAL TERMS WHO MAY WANT TO DECIDE TO RUN FOR LEADERSHIP OR WHATEVER I'VE DONE THAT MYSELF AND THEY'RE WELCOME TO IT FRANKLY BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE ENSURE THAT STABILITY GOES ON AND THEREFORE THE PRIME MINISTER DOES NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH HIS COLLEAGUES VERY QUICKLY TO DISCUSS WHAT PROCESS THAT ENTAILS AND THEN HOW THAT GOES ABOUT THAT SHOULD HAPPEN PRETTY MUCH IMMEDIATELY
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW FOUR MINUTES TO NINE AND WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON THE AIR UNTIL QUARTER TO TEN THIS MORNING BECAUSE AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS GOING TO STEP DOWN HE HE'S GOING TO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT LET HIM TELL YOU WHAT HE HAD TO SAY THIS WAS ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AGO AND MADE CLEAR THE REFERENDUM WAS ABOUT THIS AND THIS ALONE NOT THE FUTURE OF ANY SINGLE POLITICIAN INCLUDING MYSELF
BUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MADE A VERY CLEAR DECISION TO TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH
AND AS SUCH I THINK THE COUNTRY REQUIRES FRESH LEADERSHIP TO TAKE IT IN THIS
I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS PRIME MINISTER TO STEADY THE SHIP OVER THE COMING WEEKS
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR ME TO TRY TO BE THE CAPTAIN
THAT STEERS A COUNTRY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION
THIS IS NOT A DECISION I'VE TAKEN LIGHTLY BUT I DO BELIEVE IT'S IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO HAVE A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND THEN THE NEW LEADERSHIP
THERE IS NO NEED FOR A PRECISE TIMETABLE TODAY BUT IN MY VIEW WE SHOULD AIM TO HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE BY THE START OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER
AND ER LET'S GO TO ZEB SOAMES NOW A SUMMARY OF THE QUITE EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS OF THE PAST TWELVE ANSWERS DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID HE WILL RESIGN AS PRIME MINISTER AFTER THE REFERENDUM VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SPEAKING OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET IN THE LAST HOUR HE SAID THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE RESPECTED AND FRESH LEADERSHIP WAS REQUIRED
WITH HIS WIFE SAMANTHA BY HIS SIDE HE SAID HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING HE COULD IN THE FUTURE TO HELP WHAT HE CALLED THIS GREAT COUNTRY TO SUCCEED WITH ALL THE VOTES COUNTED FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO CAST A BALLOT MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND FORTY EIGHT PER CENT TO REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE CABINET THE NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY THERESA VILLIERS WHO WAS IN FAVOUR OF LEVER VOTE SO SHE WAS SADDENED THAT MY CAMERON'S DECISION
THE LEADER OF UKIP NIGEL FARAGE HAS CALLED THE RESULT OF BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENCE DAY HE SAID HE HOPED OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES WOULD FOLLOW BRITAIN THROUGH THE EXIT DOOR THE VALUE OF STERLING TUMBLED THROUGH THE NINTH DROPPING BY TEN PER CENT AGAINST THE DOLLAR TO A THIRTY YEAR LOW THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX FELL SHARPLY ON OPENING IT'S RECOVERED SLIGHTLY BUT HAS FALLEN NEARLY THREE HUNDRED POINTS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY HAS JUST SPOKEN AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND HE SAID PREPARATIONS WERE IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH MARKET VOLATILITY
THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID THE E.U. WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP ITS REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN MEMBERS AND BRITAIN'S HISTORIC VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD NOT PROVOKE HYSTERICAL REACTIONS
THE REFERENDUM HAS HIGHLIGHTED DEEP DIVISIONS WITHIN THE U.K. A MAJORITY OF WELSH VOTERS WERE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING BUT PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND VOTED STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF THE U.K. STAYING IN THE E.U. WITH ALL THIRTY TWO COUNCIL AREAS BACKING REMAIN THE FIRST MINISTER NICHOLAS SURGEON SAID IT WAS CLEAR THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SAW THEIR FUTURE AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
NORTHERN IRELAND ALSO VOTED TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BY A MAJORITY OF FIFTY SIX PERCENT TO FORTY FOUR PER CENT SINN FEIN AND MARTIN MCGUINNESS WHO SAID THE ENTIRE ISLAND OF IRELAND SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO VOTE ON REUNIFICATION
WELL WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS MONEY OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS OVER THE NEXT FORTY FIVE MINUTES AS I SAY WE HAVE TO BE ON THE AIR UNTIL THE QUARTER TO TEN I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY DANNY MINTON BETTERS YOU HAD REMEMBERED TO GO SHE'S THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE ECONOMIST AND ON THE LOAN BY ISABEL OAK SHOT HE WAS THE POLITICAL EDITOR AT LARGE OF THE DAILY MAIL
ISABEL THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY CAMERON I THINK AND BUG BUT DAVID COME AND I THINK EVERYBODY TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE WELL THIS IS A DESPERATE DESPERATE MOMENT FOR DAVID CAMERON WHAT A WAY FOR HIS PREMIERSHIP AND HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE TORY PARTY TO ENDS TWICE HE'S COME CLOSE TO DISASTER WITH REFERENDA BEFORE ONCE ON THE VOTE ON WHETHER TO CHANGE THE VOTING SYSTEM INTO A TYPE OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION AND THEN SECONDLY WAS SCOTLAND WHERE HE
REALLY WENT VERY CLOSE TO THE WIRE ON THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE THIRD TIME LUCKY AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING WITNESSING HIM MAKING THAT STATEMENT I HEARD THE CATCH IN HIS VOICE AT THE VERY END JUST SHOWING THE EMOTIONS THERE HE IS REALLY VERY VERY DEEPLY SHOCKED BY THIS AND YOU KNOW IN THE POLITICAL PRESS CORPS YOU YOU'D HAD NO INDICATION AT ALL EVEN THIS MORNING WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE
HIS VOTE TEST HIS POSITION HAD BEEN DEFEATED THE VOTE WAS LOST NO INDICATION AT ALL THAT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN WELL PERSONALLY I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IF HE LOST TO THIS HE WOULD HAVE TO STEP DOWN SO IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT HE MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT I THOUGHT THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME IF THERE WAS TO BE A LEAVE IT WOULD BE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO BUT HE WOULD MOST LIKELY
GIVE IT A PERIOD BEFORE GOING IN OTHER WORDS NOT JUST WALK OUT IMMEDIATELY I THINK THAT THAT AT THE FACT THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A COUPLE OF MONTHS HAS TAKEN SOME COLLEAGUES BY SURPRISE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THE OBVIOUS TIMETABLE IT DOES MEAN QUITE AN ACCELERATED LEADERSHIP CONTESSA WILL BE NO SORT OF MONTHS OF INDECISION FOR THE TORY PARTY WILL GAV TO GET ON WITH IT NO TAKE US THROUGH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WELL I IMAGINE THAT WE KNOW WHO SOME OF THE CONTENDERS ARE LIKELY TO BE IT MAY BE SLIGHTLY LIKE THE GRAND NATIONAL MIGHT BE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ENTERING BUT THERE ARE CLEARLY FIGURES WHO HAVE GOT A VERY BIG HEAD START OF COURSE BORIS JOHNSON SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL GAVE AS WELL THOUGH HE HAS FIRMLY DENIED IT AS WE MIGHT WE MIGHT GET A SORT OF JOINT TICKETS I SUPPOSE WITH BORIS JOHNSON AND SIMPLY SPECULATING HERE MICHAEL GAVE BACK HIM UP AS A SORT OF POTENTIAL FUTURE
CHANCELLOR AND THEN THEY WILL BE THE PROCESS OF EM PEAS WHICH TORY M.P.S CHOOSING WHICH CANDIDATE SHOULD GO FORWARD IN A SUCCESSION OF SORT OF HEAT AS IT WERE AND FINALLY ON TO THE TORY PARTY RULES THE DECISION GOES OUT TO THE WIDER MEMBERSHIP AND TWO CANDIDATES WOULD BE PUT FORWARD TO THE WIDER TORY PARTY TO CHOOSE FROM
AND THE ASSUMPTION IS ALTHOUGH HE'S NOT POPULAR WITH MANY M.P.S BUT THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT WOULD BE BORIS JOHNSON POSSIBLY THERESA MAY
WELL I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WILL BE BORIS JOHNSON BUT YOU KNOW TUI LEADERSHIP CONTEST CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE THINGS I THINK THE OTHER QUESTION MARK TODAY IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO GEORGE OSBORNE THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY MUCH A DUAL PREMIERSHIP I THINK THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EXPECTATION THAT WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM THAT GEORGE OSBORNE WAS GOING TO SURVIVE AS AN AWFUL LOT OF
HOSTILITY TOWARDS HIM WITHIN THE TORY PARLIAMENTARY PARTY EVEN BEFORE THE RESULTS TODAY SO CLEARLY HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED APPEAR BUTTER TOLD WE'VE JUST BEEN JOINED BY PETER SPEAK WHO WAS A NEWS EDITOR OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES UNDER FORMER BRUSSELS BUREAU CHIEFS PETER WE CAN COVER BOTH LOCAL AND CONTINENTAL POLICIES AS IT WERE BUT FIRST OF ALL DAVID CAMERA WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT
I THINK IT WAS EXPECTED IT HOW CAN YOU RUN A CAMPAIGN IN INTEL THE VOTERS THAT IF YOU BOOK TO REMAIN BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WILL BE DESTROYED AND THEN BE THE PRIME MINISTER WHO POTS TWO ON THAT PULSE IT WAS YOU WERE JUST UNTENABLE AND I THINK PRETTY GOOD POINT OF VIEW THERE WAS ACTUALLY WHAT EXPECTATION THAT IF YOU LOST HE WOULD HE WOULD HAVE TO BE DOING
WITH A NEW PRIME MINISTER IT MOST PEOPLE HAD BEEN PREDICTING THE DECEMBER SUMMAT SUMMAT COMMIT NEXT WEEK BUT THEY'RE ALSO TOO IN THE FORM INTO ONE OCTOBER ONE DECEMBER IN DECEMBER SUMMIT WAS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHERE THEY HAVE TO DO AT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER AND DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF HOW DO YOU BEGIN THE SEPARATION
ZOE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT I AGREE I I CAN'T SEE HOW HE COULD HAVE STAYED AT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING THAT HE'S MOVED SO QUICKLY I THINK AS A PRIME MINISTER WHO WHO SAID THERE WOULD BE CATASTROPHE IF WE LEFT EVENTUALLY HE CAN'T CREDIBLY NEGOTIATE THE LEAVING AND IT'S SURELY MUCH BETTER THAT HE GOES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER
PETER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC POLITICS BUT EUROPEAN POLITICS MASSIVELY AFFECTED BY BY THIS OR THE OTHER THE REFERENDUM RESULT WHAT D'YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO DO TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE SORT OF TWO DYNAMICS AT IN THIS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT BOWLING WEEKS AND POINT THE BRUSSELS DYNAMIC WHICH IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE TWENTY SEVEN CAN HOLD TOGETHER YOU'LL HAVE MERKEL MEANING THE FRONT ALONG TO IN THE COMING DAYS TO SHOW UNITY THEM EVEN THE NEW INITIATIVES TO PULL CLOSER TOGETHER OR FURTHER IMMIGRATION BUT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THIS MORNING IS THE SORT OF YOU KIT
LIKE ELEMENTS IN IN FRANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS IT'S GOING TO BE A CON FOR THEIR OWN REFERENDUMS SO THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A ATTEMPT BY THE MAINSTREAM LEADERS TO PULL TOGETHER BUT YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING THE CITRUS FORCES HAPPENING GOOD BUILDERS IT WAS LEADING NOW IN THE PAUSES IN DUTCH ELECTIONS CORN FOR HIT THE REFERENDUM ON MEMBERSHIP IS IT IS IT OVER DRAMATISING IT TO SUGGEST THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WE KNOW IT
HE MIGHT BE A BIT I THINK YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CORE IN THE PERIPHERY OF THE ONES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK ARE THE COUNTRIES THAT FRANKLY MOST LIKE THE U.K. SCANDINAVIAN PARTICULARLY OF SWEDEN AND DENMARK BOTH WE HAVE HAD VERY STRONG YOU'RE A SCEPTIC SENTIMENTS BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP TO BE HONEST WITH YOU WHEN YOU HAD SORT OF VERY SORT OF INTO E.U. PARTIES DO VERY WELL ON RECENT ELECTIONS THAT'S WHERE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OFFICIAL BEER ON THE MOST WORRYING EASTERN EUROPE YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN IN POLAND ARE VERY INTO YOU GOVERNMENT IN PLACE IN HUNGARY YOU SEEN AND ENTER YOU PRIME MINISTER
WITH VERY SIMILAR KIND OF RHETORIC SO THE PERIPHERAL AREAS OF THE WEEK WHERE THEY'RE MOST NERVOUS ABOUT IT IN THE EUROZONE AREA THE MOST WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAVE THE CONTAGION IN THE QUESTION IS IN THE CORE DOES THE NEVERLAND DOES FRANCE DO THESE CORE COUNTRIES ACQUIRE YOURS ON COUNTRIES BEGIN TO SUFFER THE SAME KIND OF CONTAGION I THINK THAT WILL BE WATCHING IN THE COMING DAYS AND THAT'S WHERE WANTS MOST NERVOUS
I THINK IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WE KNOW IT BECAUSE AS WE'VE KNOWN IT PAST I DON'T KNOW IT'S A GIFT BY DEFINITION HAD BRITAIN IN IT I THINK QUITE HOW FAR IT GOES IT IS IS NOT YET CLEAR IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE EUROPEANS THEMSELVES REACT AND WHAT LESSONS THEY DRAW FROM THIS IS THERE A RECOGNITION THAT WHETHER THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THERE ARE PERHAPS DIFFERENT PROXIMATE REASONS BUT THERE IS THIS ANGER AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT ACROSS EUROPE FRANKLY IT'S IN THE U.S. TOO
THERE IS THIS ANGER THAT THIS SENSE THAT WHAT THE ELITE ARE DOING IS NOT HELPING THEM AND A DESIRE FOR CHANGE AND TO HELL WITH WHAT KIND OF CHANGE THAT IS AND I THINK THAT'S THE REALLY SCARY THING NOW SUNNY PETER ISOBEL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH INDEED I SHALL WE HANG AROUND JUST IN CASE
JUST COME UP TO SEVEN MINUTES PAST NINE LET'S SPEAK TO OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG WHO WAS IN DOWNING STREET ALL THAT REMARKABLE ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENTS HERE THIS MORNING LAURA THAT'S RIGHT SERUM IN THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF IN A SENSE LOOK LIKE HE ALMOST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT I THINK HE WAS SORT OF HOLDING BACK THE TEARS REALLY HIS VOICE WAS CERTAINLY CRACKING WITH EMOTION AND HE CAME OUT AS SOON AS HE CAME OUT ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE SAMANTHA WHO LOOKING VERY DOWNCAST
IT WAS CLEAR THAT ACTUALLY HE HAD MADE THE PERSONAL CALCULATION THAT HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE NO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS IS THAT LOTS OF SENIOR CONSERVATIVES WERE PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY SAYING THIS WAS NOT WHAT THEY WANTED IN FACT A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SUCCEED HIM AS THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE LEADER PRIVATELY WOULD TELL YOU THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A LEADERSHIP CONTEST IN A HURRY
BUT CLEARLY HE MADE THE CALCULATION THAT IT WAS NOT TENABLE FOR HIM TO STAY ON TO OPEN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
SOME PEOPLE ARE PRIVATELY SUGGESTED HE JUST MIGHT NOT BE UP FOR THE FIGHT IF HE LOST HAVING STATE SO MUCH ON THIS HUGE GAMBLE BUT YOU KNOW IRONY UPON IRONY UPON IRONY YEARS AGO AS A VERY DIFFERENT LEADER YOUNG FRESH FACED UNTROUBLED BY YEARS IN OFFICE DAVID CAMERON TOLD HIS PARTY THAT HE WANTED TO STOP BANGING ON ABOUT EUROPE
HE DECIDED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO TRY TO SET ALL THAT FEST TO TRY AND CLOSE THAT FESTERING WOUND FOR GOOD THAT HE WOULD TAKE THE GAMBLE OF PROMISING A REFERENDUM HE'S BANGED ON ABOUT EUROPE AND THE RESULT HAS MEANT HE'S BANGO OFFICE WHILE WE ARE PROMISED APPARENTLY A STATEMENT FROM BORIS JOHNSON SHORTLY THE CAMERAS ARE CAMPED OUT ON HIS DOORSTEP WAITING
FOR HIM TO APPEAR JUST A BRIEF WORD ON HIM LAURA BEFORE WE MOVE ON I THINK INEVITABLY BORIS JOHNSON WILL BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT HIMSELF FORWARD FOR THE LEADERSHIP DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO AVOID ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS MORNING BUT I KNOW THAT HE WILL NOT WANT TO BE SEEN AS IF HE IS JUMPING STRAIGHT INTO IT YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE OF POLITICS TELLS YOU THAT NO
RIVAL FOR HER LEADERSHIP JOB WANTS TO BE SEEN AS THE FIRST PERSON TO POP THEIR HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET BUT AS MUCH AS HE MAY TRY TO REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT THIS MORNING IF BORIS JOHNSON MAKES ANY PROTESTATIONS ABOUT HIS AMBITION FOR THE JOB FRANKLY THEY WERE THEY WON'T REALLY BE BELIEVED
BUT THERE IS A REAL CHALLENGE HERE AFORE THE OUTERS MORE BROADLY THINK FAR BEYOND THE TORY LEADERSHIP THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER STORY HERE IS A DECISION AS A COUNTRY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT IS OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD GOING TO BE AND THERE'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE CAMP OF THOSE PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL GO VERN BORIS JOHNSON TO SHOW THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS IS NOT NIGEL FARRAJ HIS VISION OF BRITAIN THAT THE PUBLIC HAS CHOSEN
IT IS A DIFFERENT VISION SOMETHING THAT IS MORE FORWARD LOOKING MORE LIBERAL MORE PROGRESSIVE BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE SORT OF SCRAPPING OVER WHAT THIS DECISION REALLY MEANS ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND INDEED WHETHER THEY CAN DELIVER LAURA THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE LISTENING TO THAT ARE A BRUSSELS EDITOR CATCHER ADLAN CATCH OF COURSE THE RAMIFICATIONS NOT JUST HUGE FOR HERE BUT ALSO FOR THE Y. YOU WERE HEARING JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO ABOUT THE FEAR FROM OTHER E.U. LEADERS THE FEAR OF CONTAGION THAT THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO HOLD REFERENDUM
WE ALSO HAD THIS MORNING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HE'S THE MAN WHO REPRESENTS ALL E.U. LEADERS HERE IN BRUSSELS AND HE SAID YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS YOUNGER MY FATHER SAID TO ME WHAT DOESN'T KILL KILL US MAKES US STRONGER BUT THAT THE E.U. IS NOT FEELING STRONG AT ALL THIS MORNING IT WAS ALREADY REELING FROM
THE EURO CRISIS THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND FEARS OF WHAT SEEN AS AN AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA NEXT DOOR AND I THINK BRECHT'S IT COULD BE THAT BODY BLOW I MEAN THE U.K. REPRESENTED MANY THINGS
FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION ONE OF THAT ONE HAVE TO U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL SEATS BIG DIPLOMACY BIG ECONOMY A BIG WORKING MILITARY ALONGSIDE FRANCE A BIG PUSHING FACTOR BEHIND MAKING THE SINGLE MARKET MORE COMPETITIVE ALL OF THIS GOES NOW AND AGAIN AS WE HEARD THERE
BIG WORRIES ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS ALSO FOR THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU HAD EUROSCEPTIC LEADING VOICES ACROSS THE CONTINENT QUEUING UP TO CROW ABOUT THE BRECHT SET RESULTS TODAY AND EVERYBODY'S WONDERING WHERE
WHERE DOES THE Y. YOU GO NEXT AND I THINK YOU COULD SEE MORE DIVISIONS APPEARING NOW AS THE E.U. DECIDES A HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH YOU KAY HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH A NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP I'LL BE GENEROUS DO WE DO A QUICK DEAL OR DO WE DRAG IT OUT TO MAKE IT SEEM PAINFUL TO PUT OTHERS OFF AND ALSO WHERE DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION GO DO WE NEED
EVER CLOSER UNION NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN TO SHOW THAT WE ARE UNITED OR AS YOU HEARD FROM HUNGRIEST EURO SCEPTIC PRIME MINISTER TODAY BRICK SIX SHOWS BRUSSELS HAS TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE DO WE SEE A NEW AND REFORMED EUROPE AHEAD
CATCH ADLER THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX YOU'RE LISTENING TO AN EXTENDED EDITION OF THE TODAY PROGRAMME EITHER WAY WE'RE ON THE AIR UNTIL QUARTER TO TEN BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCING THAT HE WAS GOING TO RESIGN I'M JOINED ON THE LINE NOW BY ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS GRAHAM BRADY HERE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO COMMITTEE OF BACKBENCHERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING YOUR REACTION TO MY CAMERA'S ANNOUNCEMENT
WELL IT'S REMARKABLE OUTCOME
BUT I THINK THAT I SPEAK AS SOMEBODY WHO WHO WAS URGING THAT DAVID CAMERON SHOULD CARRY ON IN ORDER TO ENSURE A PERIOD OF GRACE'S POSSIBLE STABILITY
CONTINUITY I CLEARLY HE HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
STABILITY I CAN ONLY REALLY BE GUARANTEED BY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A LONG TERM PRIME MINISTER IN POSITION SOMEBODY WHO IS
PROPERLY FOR THE SIGNED UP TO LEAVING EUROPEAN UNION WHO HAS BEEN ADVOCATING THAT
AND THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP TO ARRIVE AT A BETTER OUTCOME SOONER AND YOU MAY BE RIGHT FOR THE TWO REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE HAS DONE THIS MORNING FOR WHICH I AM VERY GRATEFUL I THINK SHOULD BE THE FIRST IS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT WOULDN'T BE AN IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE
ALREADY HAVE A PRETTY QUICK BUT NOT IMMEDIATE WE'RE NOT PLUNGED INTO TALKING ABOUT OCTOBER AREN'T WE I'M AT ALL NOT A LOT WE'RE NOT PLUGS INTO IMMEDIATE TURMOIL AND THE I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THE MOMENT
HE'S TOO STEADY PEOPLE'S CONCERNS STEADY FOR MARKETS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE BEGINNING A PROCESS WHICH WILL BE GRADUAL THOUGHTFUL
AND CAN BE PROPERLY PLANNED AND THAT'S WHY THE SECOND REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU STARTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE ISN'T GOING TO TRIGGER
ARTICLE FIFTY IMMEDIATELY THAT'S THE ARTICLES OF THE THE TREATY THAT WOULD EXACTLY IN THE PROCESS OF US LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNITY TO THE TWO YEAR PROCESS FOR NEGOTIATING EXIT SO I THINK THAT GIVES US A DEGREE
CALM AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD AND A PLAN
AND STRUCTURED WAY AND ARE YOU SORT OF PERMANENTLY GEARED UP FOR THESE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS IS A SORT OF STATE OF PREPARE RUDENESS THAT'S ALWAYS THERE JUST IN CASE IT'S NEEDED AS IT WERE
I I WOULDN'T QUITE PUT IT LIKE THAT AND I DID THIS IS COVERS AS QUITE A SURPRISE TO ME WHEN I DID SO I'VE GOT DO WHAT YOU DO NOW WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF WHEREVER YOU ARE AT THE MOMENT AND YOU GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHAT'S THE NEXT THING YOU DO WELL I I THINK THE EXECUTIVES I STREW SECRET IS GOING TO HAVE TO MEET ON MONDAY
AND DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED I ASSUME THAT WE WILL FOLLOW THE SAME RULES AND PROCEDURES THAT WE DID WHEN THERE WAS VAST
CONCERNED ABOUT A LEADERSHIP ELECTION WHICH WAS ELEVEN YEARS AGO IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE DO ON SUCH A REGULAR BASIS THAT WE HAVE TO BE IN A STATE OF CONSTANT WEDDINGS YOU SAY YOU ASSUME IS IT POSSIBLE THE RULES COULD CHANGE THEM
IT IS IT IS POSSIBLE BUT I I THINK THE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE LAID OUT IN THE PARTY'S CONSTITUTION IT'S FOR CONSERVATIVE M.P.S TO PUT FORWARD A CHOICE OF CANDIDATES TO LEAVE MEMBERS IN THE COUNTRY
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT ME TOO I SHOULD THAT WOULD STILL BE THE CASE AND
IT WILL BE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EXHAUSTIVE BALLETS WHICH PROBABLY WON'T TAKE ALL THAT LONG TO TO TO TO GET THROUGH WHEN WE INITIATE PROCESS SO ANYBODY CAN THROW ANYBODY'S NAME INTO THE HAT AS IT WERE AT THIS STAGE
I SUPPOSE ALL SORTS MAJOR MIGHT THREATEN TO THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE PROPOSED AND SECONDED
AND THEN THEY WOULD BE CANDIDATES AND AN ELECTION DUE COURSE RIGHT AND SO THEY WOULD GO THROUGH TO THE FIRST ROUND LET'S ASSUME GET HALF A DOZEN NAMES THEY GO THROUGH THE FIRST ROUND AND THEY'D BEEN WIDOWED IT DOWN TO TWO
YES THAT'S THE WAY IT WOULD WORK AND THEN THOSE TWO NAMES WOULD BE PUT TO THE CONSTITUENCIES AND IT WOULD BE A MAJORITY VOTE OR ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT'S A MAJORITY
IS IT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOU ARE ON VERY EXPERIENCED BACKBENCHER FROM YOURS NEEDS HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER BE AS IT WERE PERSONALLY POPULAR WITH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT THEY MIGHT WELL RESPECT HIM OR HER HE EMPHASISED HER THAT BUT THE KIND OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM
WELL I'M I SHOULD STRESS BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF AS THE RETURNING OFFICER IN THE PROCESS I'M NOT GOING TO BE DRAWN INTO SPECULATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS BUT I THINK NO I AVOIDED ARTISTRY THAT DELIBERATELY I THOUGHT BUT I WAS JUST I THINK THAT
COLLEAGUES OBVIOUSLY TAKE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS
INTO ACCOUNT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO LEAD THE PARTY IN PARLIAMENT YOU NEED TO BUILD IN THE PARTY IN THE COUNTRY
AND OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BILL'S PROJECT A CLARITY OF MESSAGE TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE
EXTENSION WOULD BE CAPABLE OF WINNING ELECTIONS SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SKILLS WHICH ARE HE DOES AND THOSE ARE ALL THINGS TO BE BALANCED BY COLLEAGUES IN THE WEEKS AHEAD AS WE'VE SAID
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE WANTED TO BE GONE BY THE TORY PARTY CONFERENCE NEW LEADER IN PLACE BY THE TORY PARTY CONFERENCE WHICH IS OCTOBER THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER SO IT THIS PROCEDURE WOULD HAVE TO BEGIN WELL FAIRLY SOON
I THINK THAT IS VERY LIKE IF IT'S A CASE SO WEAK
NEW TO ALL OF US THIS MORNING SO WE WE HAVEN'T WORKED THROUGH WHAT THAT EXACTLY PROCESS WOULD BE BUT I THINK I THINK AS A REASONABLE
AND YOU'RE ALLOWED A PERSONAL REFLECTION I IMAGINE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE AND THEREFORE RETURNING OFFICER BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SAY HOW YOU FELT WHEN WHEN YOU SAW THE PRIME MINISTER MAKING THAT STATEMENT PURTY GLEE AT THE END OF IT HE DID SEEM TO BE QUITE EMOTIONAL
YES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL REMEMBER THAT
PEOPLE IN GAUGED IN THE POLITICAL LIFE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS WELL AND CLEARLY A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION
DAVID TO TAKE AND I SUPPORTED BY HIS WIFE AT HIS SIDE IN THE STATE
BUT I THINK ALSO NO DOUBT OUT FOR A REALLY SERIOUS PERIOD OF SOUL SEARCHING TO DECIDE WHAT WAS THE
BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR THE COUNTRY BUT I THINK AS I SAY WHILST I WAS SURPRISED THAT HE DECIDED ON SUCH A RAPID TIMETABLE I THINK AT THE SAME TIME RE ARMED
LOOKING AT AN IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE IMMEDIATE TRIGGERING OF THE ARTICLE FIFTY PROCESS
SO WE CAN I THINK PROCEED WITH
A DEGREE OF CALM AND DIGNITY AND SENSE HAVING HEARD MARK ON IT THIS MORNING HER DOING WHAT HE HAS DONE QUITE RIGHT
STEADY THE MARKET SOME TO GO CALM PEOPLE DOWN I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US NOW AFTER WHAT HE'S
WE'VE GOT A LEAK MOMENTOUS NIGHT AN IMPORTANT OCCASION
HER FULL WHO'D BUY SOMETHING MOMENTOUS NEWS THIS MORNING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WE ALL TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND REFLECT AND MOVE CALMLY FORWARD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES PAST NINE WE ARE STAYING ON AIR UNTIL QUARTER TO TEN GIVEN THE HUGE NEWS THAT WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST FEW HOURS LET'S SPEAK TO LORD MANDELSON THE FORMER LABOUR MINISTER AND OF COURSE FORMER E.U. COMMISSIONER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I KNOW YOU WERE WATCHING THE PRIME MINISTER IS HE MADE OF THAT STAINING THIS MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT
I FEEL VERY SAD ACTUALLY BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW IS THERE'S A SORT OF FELLOW PRACTITIONER OF POLITICS AND SOMEBODY WHO RESIDED PLAYED A ROLE IN TAKING
THE LABOUR PARTY ON TO THE CENTRE GROUND AYE AYE A SET BACK AND WATCHED HIM AND GEORGE OSBORNE TRYING TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME TO MAKE THE TORY PARTY AT THIS NASTY PARTY AND MORE SOCIALLY TOLERANCE AND INCLUSIVE PARTY AND ALSO OF COURSE A PRO EUROPEAN PARTY BUT THOSE WHO NEVER WANTED TO GO ON THAT JOURNEY WITH THEM HAVE FINALLY GOT THE UPPER HAND THEY DEFEATED HIM AND NOW THEY CAN TAKE THEIR LABOUR PUT OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
MORE IN THEIR OWN CHOSEN RIGHT WING ER DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT'S NOT WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS AND I THINK IT'S A SHAME BOTH FOR MISTER CAMERON A MISTER OSBORNE WHO INITIALLY FRANKLY DID SO WELL WITH WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO PULL OFF YOU SAY AND MISTER OSBORNE DO YOU THINK IT'S INEVITABLE THAT HIS POLITICAL CAREER IS OVER
IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN AFFECTED BY WHAT
BUT OVER A STOP FOR ME TO SAY I THINK IT'S OVER AND O.K. IT'S NOT MY PARTY SO ANNOYING INDEED IT'S NOT BUT WE HAD SO WE HAVE A NEW WE WILL HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE IN OCTOBER YES WOULD YOU DO YOU THINK THEY THEN HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNTRY THAT THEY'D THEN HAS TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THEY AT THE INCOMING
PRIME MINISTER I WANT TO GET HIS OR HER OWN MANDATED IT'S WHAT GORDON BROWN DIDN'T DO WHEN HE SUCCEEDED TONY BLAIR
I THINK THERE'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED AND I I WOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISED
IF THEY WENT FOR A GENERAL ELECTION AND OF COURSE THAT PRODUCES A MASSIVE QUESTION FOR THE LABOUR PARTY WHICH I WAS GOING TO BRING THE ALDWYCH AND WHETHER WE ARE READY TO FIGHT AN ELECTION THIS AUTUMN AND WITH JEREMY CORBIN AS LEADER
THAT'S THE QUESTION I KNOW AND WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER I THERE'S MY ANSWER MY ANSWER I'M AFRAID IS THAT
WHAT I THINK HAS BECOME CLEAR TO MANY IN THE PARTY DURING THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS THAT JEREMY CAN'T CUT IT
IT'S NOT AND IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF HIS BELIEFS AND VALUES WHICH ARE STRONG NOR IS IT A MATTER OF HIS
SINCERITY OR HIS COMMITMENT TO DOING THE JOB HE WORKS VERY VERY HARD HE WANTS TO DO A GOOD JOB BUT THE QUESTION IS DOES HE ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO IT AT THE LEADER OF A POLITICAL PARTY
DOESN'T JUST NEED TACTICAL OTHER SKILL THEY NEED US A REAL SENSE OF DIRECTION THEY'VE GOTTA SHOWED DEMONSTRATE STRENGTH
TO BOATERS SHOWS TO POUR THEM IN OUR DIRECTION AWAY FOR EXAMPLE YOU KIP NOW IN MANY LABOUR
AREAS BUT ABOVE ALL THEY'VE GOT TO USE THEIR VOICE TO MAKE AN IMPACT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE THAT'S WHAT WE DIDN'T SEE FROM JEREMY DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN HE DIDN'T SEE HIM
SO WOULD YOU URGE YOUR COLLEAGUES EM PEAS LABOUR M.P.S
TRIGGER AN ELECTION IMMEDIATELY NO IT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY NOT MY JOB TO DO THAT IT'S UP TO THE NEW GENERATION
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ALL I WOULD SAY ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY HAVE NOW HAD THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL IN A PARTY THE LABOUR M.P.S AT HEART ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE PUBLIC THEY WERE HEAVY DIRECT PERSONAL MANDATE
YOU KNOW ALL THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THEM IN THEIR CONSTITUENCIES IN THEIR JOB FRANKLY FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AS A WHOLE IS TO GET RE ELECTED IT MAKE SURE THERE'S A LABOUR GOVERNMENT AFTER THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION AND THEY'VE GOT TO CONSIDER VERY CAREFULLY
THE THE THE REQUIREMENTS THE CONDITIONS WHICH ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO SEE THAT SUCCESS AND OF COURSE TO JUDGE WHETHER WE HAD THE BEST LEAD ROT OUT YOU CAN LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY
INTO SUCCESS AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION WHICH FRANKLY I THINK WILL BE AND IT SHOULD BE AN OPEN GOAL FOR A SKIPPER WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ARE DOING TWO TO EACH OTHER INTO THEMSELVES IT SHOULD BE AN OPEN GOAL FOR US BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS NAGGING DOUBT I'M AFRAID AMONGST MANY THAT EVEN FACED WITH AN OPEN GOAL WE STILL MAY NOT SCORE
WHO DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THE REASONS THAT YOU THINK WE ARE WHERE WE ARE THIS MORNING OUT OF THE E.U. AND WITH A PRIME MINISTER STANDING
THEN WE COME TO THAT VERY DIRECTLY LIMITLESS SAY SOMETHING FIRST OF ALL AND THAT IS ABOUT A STRONGER RING TEAM I REASON I WANT TO SAY THIS IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE STRATEGY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PERFECT AND ALTHOUGH THERE MAY HAVE BEEN BAD POLITICAL JUDGEMENTS MADE BY THOSE WHO WERE IN CHARGE OF THE CAR
THEIR PROFESSIONALISM AND WHAT THEY BROUGHT TO THE CAMPAIGN IN THE SUPERB LEADERSHIP SHOWED BY WILL STRAW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CAMPAIGN AND WAS SECOND TO NONE
SECOND TO NONE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK AND I THINK THE REASON IT DIDN'T LIKE THIS FIRST OF ALL THAT FROM THE WORD GO IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A VERY TALL ORDER TWO TO WIN THIS RED FRED
I MEAN DOES IT IN THIS REFERENDUM IS A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS A MULTITUDE OF VIEWS ON SUBJECTS WHICH ARE UNWELL YOU WOULD NEVER WRESTLED IT OUT OF ITS PLACE
WELL AT THAT A REFERENDUM IS A LOTTERY YOU DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW WHAT ALL THE VOTERS AGAIN TOO
CHOOSERS THAT HAS THAT TOPIC SUBJECT CHRIS WHICH THEY ARE GOING TO CAST THEIR VOTE AND LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THIS THERE IS A LOT OF UNHAPPINESS IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE STATE OF PEOPLE'S LIVES
MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY FEEL THAT THEY'VE HAD THE ROUGH END OF WAITING LONG PERIOD OF AUSTERITY AND THEY FEEL MANY OF THEM IGNORED AND LEFT BEHIND BY ECONOMIC CHANGES EVEN IN A COUNTRY BY THE REWRITING OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RULES AND THEY FEEL THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO THEY
A LECK TO REPRESENT THEM BEEN SAFEGUARD THEIR INTERESTS ARE SIMPLY OVERLOOKING THEM OR NO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND DO THAT AND WE'VE GOT TO COME TO TERMS WITH HIM BISHOP ON WE LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WELL AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING TWO HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN WIPED OFF SHARES THIS MORNING AND STIRLING'S SLUMPED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THIRTY YEARS COME ON AHMED IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ALL WAS THIS WE WERE WARNED ABOUT TURBULENCE WE'RE EXPECTING TURBULENCE LIKE THIS
I THINK THE LEVELS OF VOLATILITY HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE I THINK FOR ANYONE WATCHING THE MARKETS OVERNIGHT AS I HAVE FROM TEN P.M. WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE REMAIN LOOK LIKE IT IT'D HAD A STRONG DAY THE POUND WENT UP TO ONE DOLLAR FIFTY EIGHT IT'S A HIGH FOR THE YEAR
AND THEN AS IT BECAME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT LEAVE HAD ACTUALLY WON THE POUND THEN FALL DOWN AND EXPERIENCE GREATER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY THAN IT DID IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THEN IT DID AT THE TIME WHEN THE POUND WAS EJECTED FROM THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO I THINK THAT JUST SHOWS THAT THE MARKETS I DON'T THINK ARE REALLY MAKING A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IN FIVE YEARS' TIME THE BRITISH ECONOMY WILL BE BETTER IAN OR OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT THEY'RE MAKING A JUDGEMENT OR I THINK IT'S TWO THINGS FIRSTLY
BRITAIN NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CREATES GREAT AMOUNTS OF UNCERTAINTY THERE IS JUST NO VISIBILITY ABOUT WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP WILL BE LIKE WITH OUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER THAT IS THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES OF THE E.U. AND SECONDLY NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE LIKELY TO HAVE
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANGE OF PRIME MINISTER POSSIBLY A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT DIRECTION THAT MEANS THE ECONOMIC DIRECTION OF THE U.K. COULD ALSO CHANGE I'VE GOT SORT OF TWIN TRACK OF UNCERTAINTY THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE THE E.U. ISSUE YOU ALSO HAVE NOW DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUE RIGHT WILL COME OH LET ME BRING IN SIR MARTIN SORRELL AT THAT THE BOSS OF W. P. P. HUGE MARKETING AND ADVERTISING COMPANY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
MORNING MORNING WHAT AT WHAT WAS FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR SITUATION FACING WHAT WE ARE FACING THIS MORNING WHAT DO YOU START THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW YOU MANAGE WHAT WHAT I SUPPOSE WE DON'T KNOW IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT
BUT FIRST THING AND NO RISK TO CHECK OUT THAT WE WE TAKEN ALL THE PROTECTIONS WE'RE NOT FORTUNATE PETITION AWAY THEN HE CAN BE FORTUNES SITUATIONS LIKE THIS THAT NINETY PERCENT OF OUR PROFITS ARE COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K. SO IN REPORTING TERMS
IN A WAY WE GET IT WE GET AN ADVANTAGE FROM THE WEAKNESS OF STERLING AND WERE ALSO HEDGE FROM A CURRENCY IF YOU COULD READ YOUR COST IN THAT DRAWER COUNTRIES WE OPERATE IT IN I'M NOT READY YET SO YOU MAKE THAT CERTAIN FIRST WILL BE THE BIGGEST ISSUES WHAT NO ROSE WHICH IS THE UNCERTAINTY WE WE HAVE ENOUGH GREY SWANS OR WAR
BLACK ONES WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEM ENOUGH GRACE ONES IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT WITH WHAT DOES HAPPEN O.K. WE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFERENDUM AND THAT THE RESULT MARVELLOUS RAISED
THE NEXT ANSWER WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER THERE'S AN INTERREGNUM PERIOD BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT INTRODUCES A MOTHER LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AND UNCERTAINTY IS THE ENEMY OF GROWTH AND WHAT WE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR US NOW IS THAT THERE WILL BE INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT WILL BE DELAYED THERE WILL BE DAY TO DAY DECISIONS THAT WILL BE DELAYED
I'M GOING TO SAY ENDED THE EXCUSE WILL BE IT'S NOT EXCUSE IT'S A RIO IT'S A REAL REASON FOR NOT TAKING RISK OUR BUSINESS IS ABOUT TAKING
DUKE DATED RISKS CALCULATED RISKS AND MAKING CALCULATED VESTMENTS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO THIS ADDS TO THE SHORT TERM ISM THAT WE SEE QUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT MY MY OWN INDIVIDUAL BELIEF IS THAT BRITAIN OUT OF THESE YOU WILL NOT GROW AS FAST
AS BRITAIN EAT ME AND WE WE HAS TO CUT IT WILL BE DISADVANTAGED I BELIEVE IN THE FOUR MAJOR MARKETS GERMANY FRANCE ITALY AND SPAIN WHICH ARE FOUR OF OUR TOP TEN PARK IT SO WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN THOSE MARKETS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE GROUND AT LOSE TRACTION ALONG WITH BUILDING A BUSINESS IN THE BREAKS BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA CHINA
THE NEXT ELEVEN WAS THE OTHER BIG MARKET SO FOCUSING ON OUR STRATEGY YOU DON'T NOW INCREASING ON CERTAIN TIME IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SIR MARTIN SORRELL COME ON AHMED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS HALF PAST NINE AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE DESERT ISLAND DISCS WAS GONE WELL WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR UNTIL QUARTER TO NINE BECAUSE OF THE EARTH SHATTERING EVENTS OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT YOU WILL KNOW THIS BY NOW I'VE NO DOUBT

IT WILL HAPPEN THAT WOULD SOMEHOW TAINTED BY DRIED OFF AND PULLED IT AND NOT NOT ONLY POPE HIS GOATEE WHO SHOULD BE THERE HERE IN BRITAIN WE ALL REACT CALMLY SUSAN
THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM AND OF COURSE WE DON'T
GET OLD VITE ODDS I'VE GOT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE IT IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE AND JUST A REMINDER YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS NEW STORY OF COURSE THROUGHOUT THE DAY I'VE GOT BADGERS IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME AND MONTHS INDEED CONTINUING COVERAGE ON FIVE LIVE THE NEWS CHANNEL ON THE NEWS WEBSITE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING
THERE'LL BE AN EXTENDED WORLD AT ONE IT'LL RUN FROM TWO HOURS FROM MIDDAY DAY TODAY HERE ON RADIO FOUR AND NICK ROBINSON A CONICAL BE HOSTING A SPECIAL B. B. C. ONE PROGRAMMED THE BIG DECISION ON B. B. C. ONE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TONIGHT
SO AS WE DRAW TO THE END OF THIS SPECIAL PROGRAMME EXTENDED PROGRAMME A REMINDER OF HOW THIS MORNING'S TUMULTUOUS EVENTS HAVE UNFOLDED IT WAS AS THE SUN ROSE THAT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS BEGAN TO REALISE THEY WERE ON COURSE FOR AN HISTORIC VICTORY HERE'S HOW THE LEADER OF UKIP NIGEL FARRAJ GREETED THAT VIEWS BUT DAWN IS BREAKING ALL OF INDEPENDENT UNITED KINGDOM
IF THE PREDICTIONS NOW ARE RIGHT THIS WILL BE A VICTORY FOR REAL PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE A VICTORY FOR DECENT
WE HAD OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF THE RESULT JUST AFTER SEVEN FROM THE CHAIR OF THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION JOHNNY WATSON SPEAKING IN MANCHESTER THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BALLOT PAPERS COUNTS WAS THIRTY THREE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN WAS SIXTEEN MILLION ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES CAST IN FAVOUR OF LEAF WAS SEVENTEEN MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN SAID THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE RESPECTED IN THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE Y. YOU SHOULD BEGIN SOON I'VE GOT FIFTY HAS TO BE IN VOGUE NOW SO THE RENEGOTIATE AND EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN
I THINK A LOT OF THE MESSAGE THAT'S COME BACK FROM THIS IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES
I'LL SET UP WITH CUTS THEY'VE HAD SET UP WITH ECONOMIC
DISLOCATION AND FEEL VERY ANGRY AT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN BETRAYED AND MARGINALISED BY
SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS IN VERY POOR AREAS OF THE COUNTRY
IT WASN'T LONG AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THE DAVID CAMERON APPEARED OUTSIDE DOWNING STREET TO DECLARE THAT HE WOULD CONTINUE AS PRIME MINISTER IN THE SHORT TERM HE SAID THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE RESPECTED AND FRESH LEADERSHIP WAS REQUIRED I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN AS PRIME MINISTER TO STEADY THE SHIP OVER THE COMING WEEKS
BUT I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE RIGHT FOR ME TO TRY TO BE THE CAPTAIN THAT STEERS A COUNTRY TO ITS NEXT DESTINATION
THIS IS NOT A DECISION I'VE TAKEN LIGHTLY BUT I DO BELIEVE IT'S IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST TO HAVE A PERIOD OF STABILITY AND THEN THE NEW LEADERSHIP REQUIRED THERE IS NO NEED FOR A PRECISE TIMETABLE TODAY BUT IN MY VIEW WE SHOULD AIM TO HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE BY THE START OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER
WELL I'M STILL JOINED IN THE STUDIO BYZANIUM INTO BETTER IS THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE ECONOMIST BY NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR WHAT A TIME NORMAN
I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING LIKE IT NOT JUST THE ENORMITY
OF EVENTS BUT THE PACE OF EVENTS NOW DAVID CAMERON IS GONE
I UNDERSTAND HE HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BORIS JOHNSON THIS MORNING I WOULD EXPECT THE TWO MEN TO TALK CERTAINLY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S HUGE PRESSURE ENOUGH MISTER CAMERON TO RECONFIGURE HIS CABINET TO REFLECT THIS VOTE TO BRING IN THE BRACTS ARE TEARS AND THEN TO ALL EXTENTS AND PURPOSES
HE IS PRETTY MUCH A HOSTAGE IT SEEMS TO ME IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT HAVE TO DO WHAT THE BRACTS TO TEARS ONE SO THE IDEA HE CAN TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY IF THEY DON'T WANT THAT I WOULD THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO DOWN THERE
JEREMY CORBIN SIMILARLY LATER THIS MORNING I UNDERSTAND YOU WILL HEAR A LABOUR M.P.S PUBLICLY CALLING ON HIM TO CONSIDER HIS POSITION BECAUSE THEY VIEW HIM AS VERY MUCH PART OF THE REASON WHY OUR PEOPLE ARE VOTED TO PRACTISE BECAUSE OF THE LACKLUSTRE CAMPAIGN HE THOUGHT SO HIS POSITION TO COME UNDER PRESSURE AND IN TERMS OF ALL OF US
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE KEY PIVOTAL MOMENTS IN OUR ISLAND'S STORY WE ARE TURNING OUR BACK ON FORTY YEARS OF SETTLE HISTORY I'M GOING IN AN ENTIRELY NEW DIRECTION
ZOE YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT I WOULD AND I'D HAD ONE MORE ADJECTIVE IT'S A KEY MOMENT A PIVOTAL MOMENT AND FRANKLY IT'S A TRAGIC MOMENT I THINK THIS IS REALLY A TRAGIC SPLIT IT'S BAD FOR THE BRITAIN IT'S BAD FOR EUROPE AND I THINK MORE BROADLY IT'S BAD FOR THE WESTERN I THINK WE WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS DAY AND SAY THAT FAR FROM WHAT DID NIGEL FARRAJ SAY HE'D WAS THEY'VE GOT THERE WITH THE DAWN OF BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT I THINK WE'LL LOOK BACK AND SAY THAT THIS WAS A DAY AT WHICH
BRITAIN CHOSE A PATH THAT LEFT IT POORER THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN AND EUROPE WEAKER THEY WERE OTHERWISE NO THAT ARGUMENT SUCH A LONG TIME AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T DOESN'T IT WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE BEFORE SO PERHAPS YOU'LL BE WRONG AND WILF HE SAID I WISH I HOPE VERY MUCH THAT EMMA AND NORMAN A FINAL THOUGHT FROM YOU
MY FINAL THOUGHT IS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
THIS HAS HAPPENED THERE WILL BE LOTS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT WAS IMMIGRATION IT WAS THE PEOPLE'S EVOLVED IN LARGE PART I THINK IT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT BORIS JOHNSON HE HAS GIVEN ME LEADERSHIP A FOCUS A PURPOSE TO THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT WHICH I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE STRUCK
WELL ON THAT NOTE WE WILL HAVE TO END IT I'M AFRAID NORMAN SMITH ONLY MINTON BETTERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO HAS CONTRIBUTED THIS PROBABLY THE EXTENDED PROGRAMME NEARLY FOUR HOURS OF IT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
