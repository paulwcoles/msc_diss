A MAJOR REVIEW OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE SET UP BY DAVID CAMERON HAS WARNED THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY SUPERBUGS COULD KILL ONE PERSON EVERY THREE SECONDS WORLDWIDE UNLESS THERE'S URGENT ACTION THE REPORT SAYS IT WILL COST ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS TO TACKLE THE THREAT FROM DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIA BUT FAILURE TO DO SO WILL MAKE A COMMON MEDICAL PROCEDURES TOO DANGEROUS
THE STUDY SAYS DOCTORS SHOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT TESTS BEFORE PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS TO CHECK WHERE THE PATIENTS ACTUALLY NEED THEM AND HE PROPOSES DRUG COMPANIES WHICH AREN'T INVESTING IN DEVELOPING NEW TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD FUND THOSE WHICH ARE IS OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WALSH
IN THE TWO YEARS THIS REVIEW HAS TAKEN THE TEAM INVOLVED ESTIMATE AROUND A MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE HAVE DIED FROM DRUG RESISTANT INFECTIONS BUT IT WARNS OF THIS COULD RISE TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR THE REPORT CALLS FOR A GLOBAL PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SO THAT PATIENTS DO NOT DEMAND ANTIBIOTICS WHEN THERE'S NO NEED

THANKS VERY MUCH DARREN IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES SON AND MAIL ALL LEAD ON FIGURES FROM THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS SHOWING THAT THERE ARE RECKON RECORD NUMBER OF E. U. WORKERS IN THE WORDS OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES HEADLINE THAT FIGURES IGNITE BRECK'S IT IMMIGRATION DEBATE MIGRANT WORKERS BLOW TO CAMERON IS THE HEADLINE IN THE MALE BECAUSE THE FIGURES SUGGEST
THAT THE GROWTH HAS ACCELERATED SHARPLY SINCE TWENTY TEN IT'S CLIMBED IT THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION Y. U. WORKERS AND THAT E.U. NATIONALS NOW WORK HERE THEY ACCOUNT FOR SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE THAT'S UP FROM FOUR POINT EIGHT PER CENT THREE YEARS AGO TWO POINT SIX PERCENT TEN YEARS AGO WHICH IS WHY THE SUN'S HEADLINE SHOP FIGURES BRITS NOT FAIR HE'S THE HEADLINE THE SUN PICKS UP ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE RECENT RISE IN EMPLOYMENT FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND
FOUR IN FIVE OF THOSE JOBS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K. OVER THE PAST YEAR SO ON THE SUBJECT OF EUROPE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK IS COMING TO SEE US LATER ON DURING THE PROGRAMME HAS TOLD THE TIMES THAT HE IS WELL HE'S NOT TELLING US HOW TO VOTE IT'S ONE OF THOSE PIECES THAT STARTS BY SAYING THEY'RE NOT TELLING US HOW TO VOTE BUT ACTUALLY IN THE END
MAKES IT PRETTY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS US TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. AS IN MOST POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS HE WRITES SOME OF THE RHETORIC ON BOTH SIDES HAS BEEN WILDLY EXAGGERATED BUT THERE'S NO DISPUTING ONE FACT GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF BRECHT'S ITS POLITICAL IMPACT A VOTE TO LEAVE IS A RISK THE QUESTION IS IS IT A RISK WORTH TAKING I'M NOT ADVISING THE BRITISH ELECTORATE HAD A VOTE MY BLOOMBERG SAYS BUT FOR CENTURIES THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND THEIR WORLD HAVE BENEFITED ENORMOUSLY FROM A CONFIDENT FORWARD LOOKING AND OUTWARD FACING U.K. BASED ON MY DESIRE TO SEE THE U.K. AND U.S. BOTH GROW STRONG
I'M HOPING THAT CONTINUES AND ALL THE PEAT PAPERS PICK UP ON THE WARNING YESTERDAY THAT ZEKE A VIRUS IS EXPECTED TO SPREAD IN EUROPE OVER THE COMING MONTHS ON THE FRONT OF THE TELEGRAPH AND MAKES THE LEAD FOR THE DAILY MIRROR
IT'S OF COURSE CARRIED BY MOSQUITOS AND EXPECTATION IS THAT IT WILL HIT SUMMER HOLIDAY HOTSPOTS ACCORDING TO HEALTH CHIEF
THE CONCERN OF COURSE IS MAINLY FOR PREGNANT TRAVELLERS WHO ARE BEING URGED TO TAKE STEPS TO AVOID MOSQUITOES THAT MAKE CAP CARRY IT THERE ARE WORRIES IT'S NOT A KILLER SAYS THE TRAVEL EDITOR OF THE MIRROR IT'S GOING TO BE A WORRY WE DO NEED CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT MALARIA THE CONCERN AND PICTURES OF BABIES WITH MICROCEPHALY EXTREMELY DISTRESSING BUT SEEKER IS NOT DEADLY
THE TIME IS TEN PAST SIX NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE WORN TODAY IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS AT THE WHOLE WORLD HAS GOT TO STOP USING ANTIBIOTICS LIKE SWEETS WE'VE GOT TO GET THE DRUG COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH NEW ONES AS WELL TO REPLACE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK TOM FILLED MY SCIENCE EDITOR AND JIMINY A LORD ANY HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR TWO YEARS
TOM AND HE'S NOT GONNA PULL HIS PUNCHES NO HE'S NOT AT ALL THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT THE O'NEILL REVIEW THAT WAS SET UP A DAVID CAMERAMAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN READY TO LOOK AT THIS GLOBAL PROBLEM OF THE RISE OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE THE RISE OF DRUG RESISTANT SUPERBUGS AND HE'S DIVIDED THIS REPORT INTO THREE SECTIONS REALLY THE FIRST LAYS OUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T PULL HIS PUNCHES HERE
HE DESCRIBES IT AS A SERIOUS GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND SECURITY THREAT WHICH HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO SEE TEN BILLION ADDITIONAL DEATHS A YEAR BY TWENTY FIFTY COST ONE HUNDRED TRILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF LOST MONEY I SUPPOSE TO THAT TO THE WORLD ECONOMY BY THEN THE SECOND SECTION LOOKS AT THE SOLUTIONS REALLY WHAT THAT COMES UP THERE WITH A WITH A TEN POINT PLAN TO TRY AND COMBAT THE PROBLEM AND THE THIRD INTERESTINGLY LOOKS AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT
AND ON OMELETTE PAYING FOR IT HE COMES UP WITH SOME SPECIFIC IDEAS THEN YOU TRY TO GET THE DRUG COMPANIES TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON THEIR NEW ANTIBIOTICS
THAT'S RIGHT BASICALLY WHAT HE'S TRYING IT I HE'S VERY KEEN TO MAKE THE POINT THAT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT IT'S ACTUALLY AN AWFUL LOT CHEAPER THAN NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON ON THE COSTS IN TERMS OF LIVES AND LOST MONEY TO THAT TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY TWENTY FIFTY
AND THEN HE COMES UP WITH THE CRICKET WITH THE DAMAGING FIGURE OF FORTY BILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WHICH IS WHAT HE THINKS IT WILL COST THE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WITH THE COMES UP OF A SERIES OF A OF A SORT OF CLEVER WAYS OF DOING THAT I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE G. TWENTY COUNTRIES COULD ALLOCATE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR EXISTING HEALTH BUDGETS JUST SHAVE OFF A COUPLE OF PER CENT HERE IN THERE PUT IT ALL IN THE GLOBAL FUND AND USE IT THAT WAY
HE GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF WAYS IN WHICH YOU MIGHT INCENTIVISED FOR THE DRUG COMPANIES TO DEVELOP NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO WORK OUT
PAYING FOR THAT WITH TRANSFERABLE VOUCHERS OR AN ANTIBIOTIC TAX ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SO HE'S THOUGHT QUITE QUITE SENSIBLY ABOUT HOW TO GET PEOPLE TO TO TO TO FUND THIS WITHOUT IT BEING TOO MUCH OF THAT HAVE AN ONEROUS BURDEN WELL PRESUMABLY THE INDUSTRY IF IF IT REALLY IS AS INTERVENTIONIST AS SOME OF HIS SUGGESTIONS ARE THE INDUSTRY WOULD RESIST WELL THEY MIGHT I MEAN THE PROBLEM FOR THE INDUSTRY IS
THERE ISN'T A GOOD ECONOMIC MODEL FOR INVESTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ANTIBIOTICS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS
SPENDING BILLIONS TO DEVELOP A DRUG THAT WE THEN WANT TO BE EXTREMELY POSSUM YES WITH AND NOT AS YOU SAID HAND THAT UP LIKE SWEETIES WE WANT TO KEEP IT IT KEEP IT BACK IF YOU LIKE SO HE'S ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT OFFERING A SORT OF DEVELOPMENT REWARD OF OF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR ANYBODY EVEN COME UP WITH A WITH A NEXT GENERATION ANTIBIOTIC THEY WOULD GET THE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD HELP TO TO OFFSET THEIR INVESTMENT COSTS
AND THEN AND THAT'S A WAY IN WHICH THE WORLD CAN GUARANTEE THAT WE DON'T MISUSE THIS DRUG IN THE WAY WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE CAN THEN KEEP IT ON THE SHELF ALL RIGHT ANTON THANK YOU WE'LL BE TALKING TO JIM AND HE LATER ON THE PROGRAMME TIME NOW FORTY MINUTES PAST SIX ONE OF THE GIRLS KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM IN NIGERIA HAS BEEN FOUND MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER SHE WAS TAKEN ALONG WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHERS
THE B.B.C.'S WELL ROSS HE WAS A CORRESPONDENT THERE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE GIRLS WERE TAKEN IS HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME NOW AT ONE IN THE MORNING IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SHE FOUND IT SEEMS IT WAS A LOCAL VIGILANTE GROUP THAT WAS OUT ON A PATROL IN THIS AREA THERE SOME PIECE OF FOREST WHICH IS A STRONGHOLD OR IT'S A DIMINISHING STRONGHOLD OF THE JIHADIST GROUP BOOK
AND THEY STUMBLED ACROSS SHE WAS THERE WITH HER FOUR MONTH OLD BABY GIRL SHE GAVE BIRTH IN CAPTIVITY WE WE THINK THE FATHER OF THAT BABY
ALMOST DEFINITELY ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BOOK OR RAM COMMANDERS AND SHE WAS THEN TAKEN AND HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY REUNION WITH HER HER MOTHER THE VIGILANTE GROUP TOOK US STRAIGHT TO THE VILLAGE NEAR CHIP BARK AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT AND THEY WERE HUGGING YOU KNOW UNABLE TO DETACH THEMSELVES FROM EACH OTHER AS THEY ARE THEY HUGGED EACH OTHER AND THEN SHE WAS WHISKED OFF TO THE NIGERIAN MILITARY AND SHE IS NOW BEING TAKEN OFF TO MEET THE PRESIDENT SO IT GOING THROUGH THIS EXTRAORDINARY
LIFE BUT AS I SAY I MEAN REALLY IT WAS AN ACCIDENTAL MEETING WITH SOME REPORTS THAT SHE WAS OUT FETCHING FIREWOOD SO IT WASN'T A RESCUE EFFORT AS SUCH BUT THE BIG QUESTION IT INDEED IT IS WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF FINDING THE OTHERS WELL THERE ARE SOME REPORTS GOING AROUND WE'VE GOT TO BE PRETTY CAREFUL COS PLENTY OF RUMOURS AT THE MOMENT
THAT THIS GIRL WHO WAS SEVENTEEN WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN THAT SHE'S SAYING THAT HUGE NUMBER A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF THESE GIRLS ARE IN THERE SOME PIECE OF FOREST ALIVE BUT UNDER HEAVY PROTECTION BY THE JIHADISTS SO THAT GIVES A LOT OF HOPE TO THE OTHER FAMILIES WHO ARE WAITING FOR NEWS OF THEIR MISSING LOVED ONES
EVEN NOW WITH A WEAKENED BOKO HARAM GROUP IT'S STILL GOING TO BE PRETTY RISKY AND DANGEROUS TO TRY AND GET THEM OUT BUT CERTAINLY A LOT EASIER THAN IT WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAVE HEARD SOME REPORTS THAT A FEW OF THEM SADLY HAVE DIED WHILST IN CAPTIVITY BUT CERTAINLY HIS SUGGESTION THAT A LARGE NUMBER ARE STILL ALIVE AND THAT AS A SABLE GIVE A LOT OF HOPE TO TO THE OTHER RELATIVES WILL ROSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX DIGITAL INNOVATION IS ON ROB YOUNG'S MIND THIS MORNING HE'S HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST OF US EACH MORNING GUESS GOOD MORNING ARE YOU KAY SPACEPORT DRIVERLESS CARS DRONES WHIZZING AROUND ABOVE OUR HEADS NOT A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE BUT PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OF BRITISH TRANSPORT UNVEILED IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH SO COULD BRITAIN BECOME A WORLD LEADER IN THESE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY WE CAN TALK TO ANTHONY MULLEN THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE TECH CONSULTANT GARTNER GOOD MORNING

WE'RE INCREASINGLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR FOR A MORE REALISTIC FOR TRANSPORTATION OF COOTS AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE DO DO GET WELL WE'RE AT THE SECOND AUTHOR CLARKE JUST THEIR NATIONAL SPACE INDUSTRY IN THE WORLD WHEN WE THINK ABOUT JOINS WHICH FORM PART OF THOUGHT I GUESS WE IMMEDIATELY JUMP TO THINK ABOUT CONSUMER DRAWN BUT I THINK WE'RE MUCH MORE LOYAL TO SEE PRISONERS USE OF DRONES TOOK PLACE FIRST FOR THE PASSING STUDENTS MAY KNOWING OR KISS
POLICING RIGHT SO WHAT COOK AT ONE OF THESE COMMERCIAL USES WHAT COULD THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DO WITH DRAINS WHAT COULD FARMERS DO WITH DRAINS
EXACTLY WELL WHAT A GREAT WAY OF QUANTIFYING RISK FOREIGN SURE OR SO OFTEN THEY HAVE TO WORK REMOTELY AND SECOND GUESS THE CONDITIONS ALSO AN ENVIRONMENT OR A PARTICULAR OFFENCE ANSELL JUST GIVES THEM REAL TIME EYES ON SAW THE THERE ARE THE REST MODELS CAN BE MUCH MORE UP TO DATE FARMING OF COURSE AGAIN YOU CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDED TO
FARMER LARGER CHEERING LANDON UNUSED JOINS AND THE SWEET TOO THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY CLEARLY VIEW S. SEEMS TO BE AHEAD ON MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD ON THIS COULD BE REALLY BECOME A WORLD LEADER GIVEN THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE AHEAD OF US
THAT THERE'S LOTS TO PLAY FOR YOU AND TO THE DRUMS OF THE LEEK JUST CAUGHT GOING I THINK THAT THE YESTERDAY WE TALKED ABOUT REGULATION FOR JAUNTS AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP
BUT I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD BECOME UP WE'VE GOT YOU'RE WITH THAT WAS A TRANCE I CAN'T A DRIVERLESS CARS THERE ARE TRIALS ALREADY UNDERWAY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF YOU U.K. INSURANCE LAWS ARE GOING TO BE UPDATED TO DEAL WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WHICH AREA OF MOTORING YOU THINK IS LIKELY TO BECOME DRIVERLESS FIRST
WHAT YOU AND I THINK IT'S ONE THING TO SAY IS THAT ACTUALLY CONDITIONS NEED TO GRATE YOUR FOR SOME OF THE MACHINE BY SOME TECHNIQUES TO WORK SO THAT MEANS POT HOLES AND THE ROADS THAT MEANS IMPROVING SIGNS SO THEY CAN BE READ BY MACHINES WE'RE ALSO SEEING QUITE A LOT OF ACTIVITY AND HAULAGE BEING TO SOME DEGREE IT'S ALSO THINK WILL WILL SEE SOME OF THE FIRST COURSE THE LONGER TERM
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ON THE ROAD HAVE PEOPLE MORE EFFECTIVELY I RACHE AND GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT TIME BACK I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK MORE UP THOUGH WAIT DOC PICTURE OF LOGISTICS
NOT JUST A YOU KNOW UNDER THAT YOU'LL DRIVE US AND SINGLE CARS O.K. THANK ANTONY ANTONY MELON THERE FROM ONE PLACE THAT'S ALREADY BECOMING A POWERHOUSE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION IS A STONIER POPULATION ONLY ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE BUT IT'S ONE OF EUROPE'S LEADING CENTRES FOR TECH START UPS IT'S WELL EDUCATED AND ENTREPRENEURIAL WORKFORCE ARE PARTLY TO THANK BUT OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT RORY CAPTAIN JAMES HAS BEEN FINDING OUT THE EXAMPLE OF ONE VERY SUCCESSFUL FIRM HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT
WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS A TINY SIX WILL ROBOT BASICALLY A BOX ON WHEELS
WHICH IS MAKING ITS WAY ROUND THIS INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IN TALLINN AND WERE ABOUT TO GO INSIDE AND SEE STARSHIP TECHNOLOGY IS THE COMPANY THAT'S MADE THIS
ROBOT THE SCOPE TO STARTED IN THIS RED BUILDING THEY'RE STILL OUTSIDE THE WINDOW THAT'S WHEN SHE STARTED YES AND ARTY HANDLER WAS ONE OF THE TEAM WHICH STARTED THE BEST KNOWN FIRM TO HAVE EMERGED FROM ESTONIA SKYPE HE'S NOW INVESTED SOME OF THE CASH SHE MADE THERE IN THIS ROBOT BUSINESS STARTING POINT WAS WE REALISE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THE LAST MY PROBLEM OF FOREST OF DELIVERIES
USING ROBOTS AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THAT TODAY'S OBVIOUSLY IT YOU'RE DYSTONIA IAN BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PLACE THAT MEANS
TECH COMPANIES DO YOU START HERE THERE ARE ENGINEERS HERE USED TO LIVING HERE AND WORKING WITH MY ENGINEERING TEAMS HERE AND OF COURSE IT'S A GOOD BASE TO DO ENGINEERING FOR HE'S NOT THAT'S GOOD PLACE TO DO BUSINESS AS IT WERE KIND OF LIMIT OR OUR TARGET MARKET TO ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE ANOTHER VETERAN OF SKYPE TARGET HENRICUS HAS GONE ON TO BASE HIS SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER WISE IN LONDON IT STILL DRAWS ON ESTONIAN SOFTWARE SKILLS
HE SAYS HIS COUNTRY'S PAST HAS GIVEN IT SOME ADVANTAGES TO ESTONIA WAS PART OF THE SOVIET UNION IT WAS ACTUALLY PROHIBITED TO HAVE A PRIVATE BUSINESS YET I THINK PEOPLE DO WERE INTO SOVIET TIMES ARE VERY ENTREPRENEURIAL BECAUSE ONLY WHERE YOU COULD GET SOMETHING IS ESSENTIALLY IF YOU BUILT IT YOURSELF
ACROSS TOWN A YOUNGER CROWD IS GATHERING FOR A NETWORK EVENING FOR START UPS MOBILE MONDAY TONIGHT YOU'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE LIKE ANDRE KARA BE NICK YOU'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED SEVERAL BUSINESSES
HE SAYS THERE'S ONE BIG FACTOR IN THIS COUNTRY'S SUCCESS ROY IMPACT OF SKY DENBY COMPARED DOING BACKED OFF FOR A COUPLE OF HUGE UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE OF PEOPLE GAME THROW SKYPE THE BUNCH OF THINGS
THEY MADE SOME MONEY THE ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN COMPANY'S RICE RICE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
IT'S LIKE LIKE THOSE LIKE SKYPE
IF YOU STEAL FOR A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE STONIE I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT EVERYONE IS SPEAKING ENGLISH AND STARTING A BUSINESS SEEMS SECOND NATURE HERE AND HE IS A STUDENT BUT ALSO AN ENTREPRENEUR I STARTED HEARING THIS STRONG STRONG MESSAGE
MAKE YOUR OWN COMPANY DON'T BE AFRAID LIKE LEARN HOW TO CODE EVEN YOU IF YOU'RE A GIRL I STARTED LEARNING HOW TO PROGRAM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND IF YOU SEE I'M STUDYING I.T. THAT'S CAUSING YOU CAN DO THAT SO A PARENT'S DREAM IS VERY POPULAR AND NORMAL AND
YEAH IT'S A GOOD THING LIKE STARTING A COMFORT YOUR OWN COMPANY YOUR OWN OR YOU WE BE COLIC IT TAKES LESS THAN A DAY IT JUST DO A FEW CLICKS ONLINE IT'S ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EUROS AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S SO SIMPLE
EVERY DAY THING IT'S VERY EASY
THAT WAS THAT REPORT THERE FROM RORY KATH AND JANE'S REPORTING FROM ESTONIA LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS ON INVESTORS MINDS THIS MORNING ON MARKETS GUESSES PARAS THE HEAD OF EUROPEAN EQUITIES AT FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL WHICH MANAGES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS OF ASSETS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING IT COULD INCREASE INTEREST RATES AGAIN PERHAPS IN JUNE WHY ARE THEY SO CONFIDENT
I THINK THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS BEEN PERFORMING WELL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME UNEMPLOYMENT'S BEEN FALLING BUT THE ONE THING THAT'S BEEN ABSENCE HAS BEEN INFLATION AND WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SIGNS OF INFLATION PICKING UP OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN A RECOVERING THE OIL PRICE BUT ACTUALLY IN THINGS LIKE SERVICES A HUGE PART OF THE U.S. ECONOMY ALSO STARTING SEEING PRICES PICKING UP THERE I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HE'S SHAPING THEIR ATTITUDE AT THE MOMENT A FURTHER RISE IN U.S. INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT COME THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WITHSTAND ANOTHER U.S. RAY PRICE
I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT COULD I THINK THAT THERE IS OFTEN THIS PERCEPTION THAT RATE RISES ARE A NEGATIVE THING OR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT I THINK THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE RISING FROM VERY LOW LEVELS I THINK WHAT IT COULD BE TAKEN AS IS A SIGN THAT THE U.S. IS ON A PATH OF SELF SUSTAINED GROWTH AND THAT YOU MIGHT BE TAKING QUITE POSITIVELY BY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WE'VE GOT SOME RESULTS OUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING FROM ROYAL MAIL NO LONGER OWNED BY THE STATE OF COURSE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THEM
THERE'S A FACT AT LEAST THREE THINGS THAT I THINK THE PEOPLE INVESTORS LIKE OURSELVES WILL BE FOCUSED ON IN THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES THE ROYAL MAIL TODAY IS AS MUCH A PLAY ON THE GROWTH OF COMMERCE AND ONLINE SHOPPING SO REALLY LOOKING AT THE VOLUME PICTURES ALL DELIVER SO MANY PAST ABSOLUTELY OR ALL OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS A DEMAND FOR HE SIS IS STRONG
AT THE SECOND IS PRICING WILL SEE QUITE A LOT OF REPAIR IN THE MARKETS ARE COMPANIES LIKE T.N.T. CITY LINK GOING OUT OF THE MARKETS ARE HOPEFULLY THE PRICING
ENVIRONMENT IS BETTER AND THEN THE THIRD THING REALLY IS ON EFFICIENCY THE REGULATORS PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ROYAL MAIL TO BE MORE EFFICIENT MORE COST EFFICIENT SO WILL BE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF THAT O.K. THANK YOU PARIS FROM FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL ESTATE AGENT SAY BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE COMPROMISING PLANS TO BUILD THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES A REPORT FROM TWO INDUSTRY BODIES ALSO SAYS A BRECHT
COULD LEAD TO LOWER RENT BILLS AND A FALL IN HOUSE PRICES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS PERHAPS PROVIDING FIRST TIME BUYERS WITH SOME BREATHING SPACE AS DEMAND FOR HOUSING EASES OFF WITH US THIS MORNING US DAVID COX THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENTIAL LETTING AGENTS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO WHAT PROPORTION THEN OF THE HOUSE BUILDING WORKFORCE IS MADE UP OF WORKERS FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF WORKERS ARE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DO YOU COME FROM WITHIN THE E.U. BUT OUTSIDE THE U.K.
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS THAT WE'VE ALREADY GOT A MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IN THE U.K. HOUSE BUILDERS ARE BUILDING NOWHERE NEAR THE NUMBER OF HOME TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE TRYING TO TRYING TO BUILD ONLY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IF YOU TAKE THAT SKILL SHORTAGE OUT
FIRSTLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE AS MANY CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO BUILD THE HOUSES BUT THOSE THAT ARE STILL HERE I CAN BE ABLE TO COMMAND A HIGHER PRICE THAT WILL INCREASE THE COST TO THE DEVELOPERS WHICH WILL BE PASSED ONTO HOMEOWNERS
HOUSES WOULD STILL BE BUILT THOUGH THEY WOULD INDEED WE ALSO HAVE TO FACTOR IN THINGS LIKE BRICKS WE HAVE CHRONIC SHORTAGE IN THE U.K. OF BRICKS AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF OUR OUR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AS WELL AS OUR WORKFORCE COME FROM WITHIN THE E.U. AND THEREFORE ALL OF THESE WILL START INCREASING THE COST TO THE DEVELOPERS ARE BUILDING WOULD BE PASSED ON TO FIRST TIME BUYERS AND THEREFORE WE WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT IN THE LONG RUN EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOT SOME UNCERTAINTY AT THE MOMENT IF CAMPAIGNERS SAY THERE WOULD STILL BE FREE TRADE AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD NECESSARILY IMPACT THAT THE PRICE OF ANY GOOD
BUT HOUSE PRICES IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN SAWING THE CHANCELLOR SAID THAT THEY COULD FALL IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION YOUR REPORT THIS MORNING SAYS THE SAME SIR HOW MUCH WOULD HOUSE PRICES FALL BY IN YOUR VIEW SONNY I WE SEARCH TODAY SUGGESTS THAT BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE IN THE U.K. IS LIKELY TO HAVE GONE DOWN BY ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MAYBE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS
BUT IF WE LOOK TO LONDON SPECIFICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF THOUSAND DROP IN HOUSE PRICES BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT'S NOT MUCH IT'S NOT MUCH ABOUT ONE PER CENT BUT IT WILL TAKE OUT ABOUT TWENTY SIX AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS OUT OF THE LONDON HOUSING MARKET AS WE LOSE OUR SAFE HAVEN STATUS
A CORRECTION IN HOUSE PRICES PARTICULARLY IN THE CAPITAL WOULD BE VERY MUCH WELCOME BUT I SUSPECT BY FIRST TIME BUYERS OR PERHAPS AN ECONOMIST IN BEEN MORNING ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET OVERHEATING INDEED IT WOULD AND I THINK FIRST TIME BUYERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS WHERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A BARGAIN BUT WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS AND THE LONG TERM SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUES IN THE HOUSING MARKET FOR THE GOVERNMENT REALLY ISN'T GETTING TO GRIPS WITH
IS DEMAND REALLY LIKELY TO FALL FROM FOREIGN INVESTORS TICKLEY FROM CHINA INDIA THE MIDDLE EAST WHEN LONDON WHICH HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY HUSS CLEARLY SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER THAN JUST ITS MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY SEEING IT I THINK IT'S THIS PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY PROPERTY PRICES ARE HIGH HOUSE COSTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HIGH IN THE U.K. WE'VE GOT THE SAFE HAVEN STATUS HERE
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME INVESTORS HOLDING OFF WAITING FOR HER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE ANSWER AWAITS THANK YOU DAVID DAVID COX THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF RESIDENTIAL LETTING AGENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET US TURN TO THE SPORTS AND ALISON AS THIS MORNING HELLO GOOD MORNING TO YOU JUSTIN MY LIVERPOOL CAPITULATED IN THE SECOND HALF LAST NIGHT'S OR LOSE THE FINAL OF THE EUROPA LEAGUE TO SEVERE THEY WERE LEADING ONE NIL COURTESY OF A BRILLIANT FINISH FROM DANIEL STURRIDGE BUT IT STARTED TO GO WRONG SOON AFTER HALF TIME HARRY

MEMBERS OF THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL BE ASKED TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO ACCEPT A DEAL REACHED YESTERDAY WITH GOVERNMENT GAULTIER SHE WAS TO END THE DISPUTE OVER A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND BOTH SIDES REACHED AN AGREEMENT AFTER TEN DAYS OF TALKS THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SAID THE DEAL WAS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A MINOR STROKE SHOULD TAKE ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT OR LIMIT THE HARM CAUSED BY FURTHER STROKES ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY WRITING OF THE LANCET MEDICAL JOURNAL RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAID THE BENEFITS OF TAKING ASPIRIN AT AN EARLY STAGE OF TREATMENT HAVE BEEN HUGELY UNDERESTIMATED
THE U.S. HAS ACCUSED CHINA HAVE SAFELY INTERCEPTING AN AMERICAN RECONNAISSANCE PLANE OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THE PENTAGON SAYS TO CHINESE FIGHTERS FLEW WITHIN TWENTY METRES OF THE U.S. AIRCRAFT FORCING THE PILOT WHO DRAMATICALLY LOSE HEIGHT TO PREVENT A COLLISION THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AS WE WERE HERE IN EGYPT AIR FLIGHT FROM PARIS TO CARA'S DISAPPEARED FROM THE RADAR LET'S TURN TO OUR CORRESPONDENT SELLING A BILL WHO IS IN CAIRO AND SUNNY JUST BRINGS UP TO DATE WITH WHAT THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO FAR IS THAT DRESS JOHN SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE UNDER WAY THEIR DICTION ARMY HAS ALREADY THE PLOY TEAMS TO SEARCH FOR THE PLAIN NAVY SHIPS THROUGH THE MEDITERRANEAN FIGHTER JETS ARE SEARCHING FOR THE PLANE IN THE LOCATION WHERE IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED BUT SO FAR THERE IS NO OFFICIAL STATEMENT WHATSOEVER TO CLARIFY WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED
LOCAL SAUCERS THE CAIRO AIRPORT SAID THAT AT THE LAST RECORDED CUT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PILOT AND AIRPORT AUTHORITY AS WAS IN GREASE TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE PLANE HAS DISAPPEARED ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT ISSUED BY EEJIT THERE IT SAID THAT THE PLANE DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER IT WENT INTO THE EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE THERE WERE SIXTY SIX MEMBERS ON BOYER SIXTY SIX PASSENGERS ON BOARD
AND WE DON'T KNOW SO FAR WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED IN FACT I THOUGHT IT IS THAT REALLY CAUTIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO AVIATION ACCIDENTS BOOK BUT WHAT WE DO SEEM TO BE DISCOVERING IS THAT WHATEVER DID HAPPEN WHATEVER WENT WRONG HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY
EXACTLY BECAUSE ACCORDING TO LOCAL SAUCERS NO DISTRESS CALL WHATSOEVER WAS RECORDED FROM THE PLANE BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED THEN THIS SURVEYS AS MANY QUESTIONS ACTUALLY ABOUT ONE OF THE REASONS BEHIND THE DISAPPEARANCE A AND THIS ADDS TO OUR INFLICTS MORE DAMAGE ON THE EGYPTIAN AVIATION INDUSTRY TOURISM INDUSTRY BECAUSE THIS IS THE THIRD MAJOR AVIATION ACCIDENT TO TAKE PLACE HERE AND HE'D HAVE BEEN IN A FEW MONTHS ACTUALLY
LAST OCTOBER A RUSSIAN PLANE CRASHED OVER THE EDGE OF THE SINAI PENINSULA LAST MARK LAST MARCH AN EGYPTIAN PLANE WAS HIJACKED AND TAKEN TO CYPRUS AND HERE WE GO WITH THIS ACCIDENT TODAY THIS CAUSES A LOT OF DAMAGE ACTUALLY TO BOTH STOOD AS AN AVIATION WILL OBVIOUSLY AS WE HEAR FURTHER DETAILS AND INDEED BECAUSE THE CRASH SITE POTENTIALLY AS FOUND DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU FOR THE TIME BEING CELL IN A BILL IN MY CURRY THANKS
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THAT COULD MEAN THERE ARE NO MORE STRIKES BY JUNIOR DOCTORS NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR AND NORMAN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL AND HOW THEY MANAGED TO REACH A BREAKTHROUGH AFTER SO LONG WELL IT'S A COMPLEX DEAL BUT BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE THE
JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE BEEN FORCED PRETTY MUCH ONTO THE BACK FOOT HERE BECAUSE THE DEAL MEANS THEY WILL NOW WORK ACROSS SEVEN DAYS OF THE WEEK AT NORMAL PAY RATES BUT IF THEY WORK A HIGHER PROPORTION OF WEEKENDS MORE THAN ONE IN SEVEN
THEY WILL GET A THREE PER CENT UPLIFT IN THEIR SALARY AND IF THEY WORK EVERY OTHER WEEKEND THEY'LL GET A TEN PERCENT UPLIFT IN THEIR SALARY BUT OFFSET AGAINST THAT THEIR OVERALL PAY RISES CUT FROM THIRTEEN PERCENT TO JUST OVER TEN PER CENT AND WHEN YOU ASK SO IS THERE ANY MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE
THE ANSWER IS NO AND MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THE B.M.A. RECOGNISED PRETTY MUCH RUN OUT OF ROAD ON THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION FRONT BECAUSE IT SEEMS THERE WAS
A VIEW THAT THEIR LAST STRIKE WHICH WAS THE ALL OUT STRIKE INVOLVING EMERGENCY CARE WAS PRETTY MUCH THERE LAST ROLL OF THE DICE IN TERMS OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION THERE WAS NO REAL STOMACH TO GO FURTHER IN TERMS OF A ROLLING CAMPAIGN OR AN ALL OUT STRIKE I THINK TOO THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT PRETTY MUCH HIT THE BUFFERS IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT RESISTANCE BECAUSE MINISTERS HAD MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A RED LINE FOR THEM THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CONCEDE ON A MANIFESTO COMMITMENT MORE THAN THAT
THEY TOOK THE VIEW THAT OTHER BIG PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS WERE WATCHING THIS AND THEY GAVE IN TO THE DOCTOR'S THEN THEY'D HAVE TO GIVE TO OTHERS THEIR ONLY REAL HOPE I THINK WAS THAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD STEP OVER JEREMY HUNT
AND HE WOULD INTERVENE WELL MISTER CAMERON HAS ACTUALLY COME IN BEHIND THE STANTON I THINK FACED WITH THAT THE B.M.A. HAVE DECIDED THEY'VE GOT TO SETTLE AND ARE NOW RECOMMENDING THIS DEAL TO THEIR MEMBERS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEIR MEMBERS WHO MANY OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW MADE INCREASINGLY ANGRY AND RADICAL
JUST BY GOING OUT ON STRIKE WHETHER THEY WILL BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE DEAL QUICK WORD MUD STORY THIS MORNING OF THE PLEA FROM THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. STEPHEN BAKER WHO WANTS THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE PLEA TO TONE DOWN SOME OF THE RHETORIC FROM THE REMAIN AS
HE'S BASICALLY CALLING FOR A TRUCE IN THE PERSONAL ATTACKS AND BRIEFINGS IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND HE ACCUSES THE REMAIN SIDE OF WHAT HE CALLS INSULTS PERSONAL ATTACKS AND TABLOID SMEARS AND WARNS IF THIS DOES NOT END THEN IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER AGAIN I MEAN IT'S WORTH SAYING OR SOMEONE ON THE RECEIVING END OF A LOT OF THESE BRIEFINGS
THESE COME FROM BOTH SIDES FRANKIE I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE FROM THE BRAKES IT SIDE ACCUSING SIR CAMERA OF BEING A LIAR TALKING ABOUT DODGY DEALS I'VE HAD SOME SUGGESTING THEY'RE GOING TO PUT OUT LEAFLETS NEARER THE REFERENDUM DATE SAYING KICK OUT CAMERON VOTE FOR BREAKS IT I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT ENTIRELY ONE SIDED AFFAIR
BUT I THINK IT DOES REFLECT THE HUGE MISMATCH IN IF YOU LIKE MEDIA RESOURCES AND GENERAL FIRE POWER BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS WHEN YOU GO TO BRIEFINGS IT'S CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN AWFUL LOT MORE WELLY THAN BE THE BRECHT'S THAT SIDE AND I THINK THEY ARE FEELING UNDER PRESSURE WHICH IS WHY BRIEFLY BRIEFLY THE I.D. WAS SLATED BY NIGEL FARAGE HAVE A SECOND REFERENDUM WE SAW THEIR REACTION TO THE I.T.V. DEBATE
PROPOSALS I MEAN I DO YOU THINK THEY'RE UNDER PRESSURE WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE NOW PRESENTING THIS REFERENDUM IS THE LITTLE GUY VERSES THE BIG GUY THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE ELITES NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S A GOOD THING TO KEEP AN ASPIRIN HANDY HIM NOT JUST FOR HEADACHE ADAM BRIM LOWERS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT THIS IS AN INTERESTING PIECE OF ADVICE ADAM ISN'T IT THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY UP POTENTIALLY CHANGE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE REGARD ASPIRIN AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ONE CLOSE BY
THAT'S RIGHT JUSTIN'S VERY POWERFUL NEW EVIDENCE ON THE BENEFITS OF ASPIRIN TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER A MINOR STROKE SO SUDDEN WEAKNESS IN THE FACE OR ARMS SLURRED SPEECH IMPAIRED VISION OR A MINI STROKE WHICH IS WHEN THE SYMPTOMS COME AND GO QUICKLY AND TAKEN TOGETHER THAT'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVENTS A YEAR IN THE U.K. AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS IF YOU HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS THERE'S A SERIOUS RISK OF ANOTHER STROKE OFTEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS
PREVIOUS EVIDENCE HE SUGGESTED TAKING ASPIRIN REDUCE THE RISK OF THAT HAPPENING BY ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT BUT THAT'S OVER QUITE A LONG PERIOD THIS STUDY IN THE LANCET HIGHLIGHTS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CRUCIAL HOURS AND DAYS
AFTER THE SYMPTOMS AND FOUND IT COULD REDUCE THE RISK OF ANOTHER STROKE BY EIGHTY PERCENT AND IF ANOTHER SHOW DEREK IS LIKE HE'D BE A LOT LESS SEVERE
BUT IS IT OURS ARE THEY SUGGESTING PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP ATOMS IN THEIR PURSES AND WALLETS OR OR JUST THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS OR HAVING THOSE SYMPTOMS HE SHOULD DO SOME IT'S ABOUT TAKING ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY IN THIS HAS PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE DESPITE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGNS TO GET HELP IF PEOPLE HAVE A STROKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH MINOR SYMPTOMS DON'T DO THAT THEY WAIT AND
AND THEY'RE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO GO TO HOSPITAL FOR A MINOR STROKE DOCTORS ARE OFTEN WARY OF GIVING ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY SO THE RESEARCHERS SAY THE MESSAGES FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENTS MUST CHANGE THEIR CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR DOCTORS THEY SAY SHOULD STRESS THE BENEFITS THAT ASPIRIN SHOULD BE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LATER AND THEY SAY FOR PATIENTS THAT MESSAGE SHOULD BE IF THERE'S A MILD STROKE OR MY STROKE SYMPTOMS CALL FOR HELP AND TAKE AN ASPIRIN AND A THAT THANKS
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF SEVERAL MULTI NATIONAL COMPANIES HAVE WRITTEN TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES SUPPORTING A VOTE FOR THE U.K. TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. THE LETTER SIGNATORIES INCLUDE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC HE TOUCHY AIRBUS AND BLOOMBERG THEY SAY BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP IS A WIN WIN SITUATION ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT GIVING COMPANIES ACCESS TO A MARKET OF HALF A BILLION PEOPLE
LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD MEAN A SHOCK TO THE U.K. ECONOMY HURTING GROWTH THEY SAID IN THE GUARDIAN THE NOVELIST SAY MITCHELL SAYS SHE'S FED UP WITH HEARING ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR BIG BUSINESS SHE SAYS THE E.U. POSES A DIRECT THREAT TO DEMOCRACY AND THE BRITISH WORKING CLASSES I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KIDS FROM THE ESTATE ARE EXCITED ABOUT STARTING THEIR OWN MEDIA COMPANY IN MILAN
ALASTAIR HEATH IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THE REMAIN ECONOMISTS ARE WRONG HERE REMEMBERS HOW MAJORITY OF LEADING ECONOMISTS WANTED THE U.K. TO JOIN THE EURO IN TWO THOUSAND FOR TIME AGAIN HE SAYS IT'S SMALL DESPISED MINORITY GETS IT RIGHT THE DAILY MAIL SAYS JEREMY HUNT APPEARS TO HAVE WON HIS BATTLE WITH JUNIOR DOCTORS
IT REPORTS THAT THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS SIGNED A PROVISIONAL CONTACT CONTRACT WHICH ON PAPER SEEMS FAR WORSE FOR DOCTORS THAN THE TERMS THEY FIRST DEMANDED THE TELEGRAPH SEES IT IN THE SAME LIGHT SAYING THAT THE UNIONIST CLIMB DOWN OVER WEEKEND PAY GUARDIAN SAYS A BACKLASH IS GROWING ONE DOCTOR TELLS THE PAPER IT'S THE BEE AMAZED TURN TO TRY TO SELL THIS AS A GOOD DEAL
THE MAIL SAYS TO S.N.P. M.P.S OR DEFACE A PARLIAMENTARY GRILLING AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF CLAIMING EXPENSES FOR ACCOMMODATION THEY WERE SAID TO HAVE HAD AFFAIRS INSIST SIR ANGUS MACNEIL AND STEWART HOSIE BHA BEEN REPORTED THE STANDARDS COMMISSIONER BY THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVES DEPUTY LEADER AND S.N.P. SPOKESMAN SAID TO SUGGEST ANY FINANCIAL IMPROPRIETIES TOTALLY WRONG SEVERAL OTHER PAPERS PICK UP THE STORY AS WELL THE TIME SAYS SENIOR FEMALE MEMBERS OF THE S.N.P. HAVE ROUNDED ON THE TWO MARRIED MEN AN UNNAMED M.P. TELLS THE PAPER THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS WITH MEN
A WOMAN PUSHES THEIR BUTTONS AND THEY FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THE NEWS THAT AN EGYPT AIR PASSENGER JET WITH SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD HAS DISAPPEARED ON A FLIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO THERE WAS POMP PAGEANTRY AND WHAT PASSES FOR PARLIAMENTARY HUMOUR YESTERDAY AS THE QUEEN SET OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN WAS WATCH
THE STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT IS A CURIOUS COCKTAIL OF PAGEANTRY AND POLITICS THE OLD AND THE NEW THE QUEEN TRAVELLED IN A GOLDEN CARRIAGE FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE TO WESTMINSTER TO AMOUNT TO PLANS FOR DRIVERLESS CARS MY MINISTERS WILL ENSURE THE UNITED KINGDOM IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY
A NEW FORMS OF TRANSPORT INCLUDING AUTONOMOUS ELECTRIC CLEAR CAUSE ONCE THE POMP AND CEREMONY WAS OUT OF THE WAY IT WAS TIME FOR ANOTHER TRADITION THE NEW PARLIAMENTARY YEAR BEGINS WITH LIGHT HEARTED SPEECHES FROM TWO GOVERNMENT TEN P.'S FIRST UP WAS THE FORMER ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY CAROLINE SPELLMAN WHO RISKED A MENTION OF THE FORTHCOMING E.U. REFERENDUM WHICHEVER WAY THE VOTE GOES WE WILL NEED TO ENSURE GOOD RELATIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS MOVING FORWARD
SECONDING WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE HUMBLE ADDRESS WAS PHILIP LEE A PRACTISING G.P. WHO TALKED ABOUT HIS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE OF P.
MEDICAL CONTEXT P. R. DOES NOT STAND FOR PUBLIC RELATIONS BRITISH SHORTHAND FOR THE TYPE OF EXAMINATION THAT INVOLVES PUTTING ON RUBBER GLOVES HOW CRYING AND ASKING A MAN TO CALL
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WAS RESPONDING TO THE QUEEN'S SPEECH FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS PLENTY OF CROSS PARTY LAUGHTER WHEN HE PRAISED CAROLINE SPELLMAN I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'S BEEN A STALWART OF THE PARLIAMENTARY CHOIR FOR MANY YEARS
PERHAPS YOU WILL FIND TIME TO GIVE ME SOME SINGING LESSONS GIVEN HER BACKGROUND PERHAPS TOGETHER WE COULD SING THE RED FLAG AS A DUET
THERE WAS MORE LAUGHTER WHEN A CONSERVATIVE SHOUTED OUT WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
WE'LL SIT WE'LL SAVE ON THE WIDEST HYMN SHEET BUT MISTER CORBIN WAS LESS IMPRESSED BY THE QUEEN'S SPEECH IF ANYONE WANTS TO DELIVER A MORE EQUAL SOCIETY AND ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE
A SOCIETY WHERE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL IT TAKES AN ACTIVE GOVERNMENT TO DO DOING
NOT THE DRIVERLESS CAR HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE IN THIS CUPBOARD AT THE PRESENT TIME
DRAWING DEBATES IN THE COMMONS M.P.S OFTEN STAND UP IN THE HOPE THAT THE PERSON WHO HAS THE FLOOR WILL TAKE THEIR INTERVENTION SEVERAL CONSERVATIVES TRIED TO CHALLENGE JEREMY CORBIN HE IGNORED THEM ALL HIS SPEECH LASTED JUST OVER FORTY MINUTES AND BY THE END THERE'D BEEN A DISTINCT CHANGE OF MOOD THE LABOUR LEADER SAT DOWN TO A LOUD CHEER FROM THE CONSERVATIVE BENCHES AND SARCASTIC SHOUTS FOR MORE
DAVID CAMERON ALSO PRAISED CAROLINE SPELLMAN AND MADE A JOKE AT HIS OWN EXPENSE BUT HIGHLIGHTED THE TENSIONS IN THE CONSERVATIVE RANKS OVER EUROPE EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE NO SHE IS A DEEPLY COMMITTED CHRISTIAN THIS WOULD'VE COME IN HANDY DURING HER TIME IN DEAF WHEN SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH FLOODS DROUGHTS FOOD SHORTAGES AND EVEN DISEASE INDEED EVERYTHING SHORT OF A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS WHICH OF COURSE I WILL BE PREDICTING IN MY NEXT SPEECH ON YOU
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THE QUEEN'S SPEECH WOULD HELP TACKLE DEEP SOCIAL PROBLEMS MISTER SPEAKER WE ARE BUILDING A GREATER BRITAIN AGAIN WITH A SOUND ECONOMY STRONGER FENCE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THESE ARE THE ACTIONS OF A PROGRESSIVE ONE NATION CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT I COMMEND THIS SPEECH TODAY
BUT THE S.N.P. LEADER AT WESTMINSTER ANGUS ROBERTSON BUT THERE WAS A LOT MISSING FROM THE PROGRAMME AND HE SAID NEARLY ALL OF THE PROPOSED MEASURES WOULD ONLY AFFECT ENGLAND AND WALES THEY RELATE TO EDUCATION TO ADOPTION TO REFORMS TO DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND SO WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER TALKS ABOUT THIS BEING A ONE NATION QUEEN SPEECH WE ON THESE BENCHES KNOW WHICH NATION JUST TALKING
AT THE OTHER END OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY TOM NOW LORD KING PAID A TUNEFUL TRIBUTE TO THE LEADER OF THE LORDS LADIES STOLE AS HE RECALLED SOME LINES FROM THE MUSICAL SOUTH PACIFIC HUNDRED POUNDS OF
THAT'S MY LITTLE HONEY
THE LORD'S INFLICTED SIXTY DEFEATS ON THE GOVERNMENT DURING THE LAST SESSION THE LEADER OF THE LIB DEM PIERS LORD WALLIS THANK SOME MINISTERS WHO'D BEEN WILLING TO COMPROMISE MINISTERS VERY OFTEN STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO BUDGE ON A HOST BUT VICIOUS
IS WHAT MATTERS WHICH CHALLENGED MANIFESTED COMMITMENTS
OR RATHER ONE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THESE COMMITMENTS WERE DELIVERED AND HER FEAR AND PROPORTIONATE MANNER
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH WAS OVER IN TEN MINUTES BUT M.P.S AND PEERS WILL SPEND THE NEXT WEEK DEBATING ITS CONTENTS
THAT WAS SEAN CURRAN AND MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT HALF PAST EIGHT ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE TUNNEL IS TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN WE SHOULD READ OUR DAUGHTER'S BETTER STORIES FEWER PRINCESSES AND MORE SUPERHEROES FEMALE
WINNERS ILONA FAB EALING IS THE CO CREATOR OF GOODNIGHT STORIES FOR REBEL GIRLS IT'S A START UP BASED IN LOS ANGELES RAISE QUITE A LOT OF MONEY TO GET A CAMPAIGN TOGETHER TO PUBLISH TALES ABOUT REAL LIFE WOMEN WHO DO AMAZING THINGS SHE'S ON THE LINE AND SAYS ABIE LONGSTAFF AS A CHILDREN'S AUTHOR WHOSE WORK INCLUDES THE FAIRYTALE HAIRDRESSER SERIES MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING HELLO THERE FOR THE FIRST OF ALL THE LINE FROM LOS ANGELES TELL US WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO PRODUCE
WE LAUNCHED A GOOD MY STORIES WERE REBEL GIRDERS AS A KICK START A PROJECT A FEW WEEKS AGO AND
THE GOAL WAS REALLY TO PRODUCE CHILDREN'S BOOK THAT COULD REINVENT FEAR IT IS SHOWING
THE EXAMPLE OF EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN FROM THE PAST FROM THE PRESENT TIME WE MEN WHO HAVE ACHIEVED EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WHOOSH O.K. SEEING AS CHEFS ENGINEERS PAINTERS
ARCHITECTS ANY ANY TYPE OF PAPER FEEL THAT JUST TO SHOW A LEG OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROLE MODELS FOR FOR YOUNG GIRDERS AND YOUNG WEE MEN AND WHO'S DOING THE WRITING
SO I AM DOING THE WRITING TOGETHER WITH MICHAEL FOUNDER FRANCESCA HAVE A LOW WE HAVE CHILDRESS MEDIA COMPANY CALLED TIMBUKTU LABS HERE
AND ARE YOU ANYWAY A PROFESSIONAL WRITER ARE THESE ARE THESE ARE DEEP DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW TO APPEAL TO THE AUDIENCE WHO WANT TO APPEAL TO
YES OF COURSE WE DO WE WE WE HAVE A CHILDREN'S MEDIA COMPANY SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PIECE FOR FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS NOW AND WE ALREADY PUBLISHED A FIRST SERIES OF SIX BOOKS LAST YEAR WITH OR WITHOUT THE EUROPEAN PUBLISHER THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE GOING TO PUBLISH
A BOOK AS AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS AT THE SAME TIME YES I BELONG STUFF DO YOU THINK HER WORK YES I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A PLACE FOR NON FICTION BOOKS ABOUT WOMEN OR BOYCE
BUT THERE STILL A PLACE FOR TRADITIONAL FAIRYTALES I MEAN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO READ YOUR CHILD THE KIND OF BOOKS THAT THEY WANT TO LISTEN TO READING IS ABOUT PLEASURE PARTICULARLY BEDTIME READING AND
THIS SMALL CHILDREN LEARN THAT READING IS FUN AND AND PLEASANT THE BETTER SO MANY SHELLS LOVE NON FICTION THEY LOVE ENCYCLOPAEDIAS SOME CHILDREN LOVE COMICS BUT LOTS OF CHILDREN STILL LOVE FICTION AND FAIRYTALES AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FEEL LIKE
YOU KNOW BAD PARENTS ARE BAD FEMINIST FOR READING THEM FAIRY TALE ONLY I SUPPOSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMETIMES THE FAIRYTALES MILITATE AGAINST THE NON FICTION STUFF SO WE HAVE NON FICTION THERE IS SHOWING HOW
STRONG WOMEN IN HISTORY AND INDEED NOW CAN ACHIEVE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEN YOU HAVE FAIRYTALES WHERE WOMEN ARE ALWAYS BEING RESCUED ARE NEVER THERE NEVER OTHER PROTAGONISTS IN THAT THAT IS LIKE A CLASH IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THAT YOU TALK ABOUT STRONG WOMEN IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THESE FAIRY TALES WERE WRITTEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AT A TIME WHERE THERE WERE VERY FEW RATES FOR WOMEN TO ADVANCE FINANCIALLY THEY USUALLY DIDN'T INHERIT THEY DIDN'T HAVE JOBS AS YOU SAY
THE ROOTS TO GO UP THE LADDER WAS MARRIAGE AND SO WE CAN'T REALLY JUDGE THEM SO MUCH BY THE LENS OF TODAY HE WAS ALWAYS AN OUTSIDER INTERACT AS A SLIGHTLY SORT OF TIMES NO MATTER JUDGING THEM IT'S A MATTER OF SAYING THEY'RE NO LONGER SUITABLE
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE THEY'RE STORIES ABOUT STRUGGLE THEIR STORIES ABOUT HOPE THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT BADDIES I MEAN
NON FICTION IS A PLACE FOR IT BUT YOU WOULDN'T READ A BOOK TO A CHILD A BEDTIME ABOUT SOMEONE BEING ABUSED BUT YOU MIGHT NEED THEM CINDERELLA AND THAT OPENS A DOOR TO TALK ABOUT DARK ISSUES AND THAT'S THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT FANTASY FICTION THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT REALLY THAT THAT YOU'RE NUMBER ONE IT SHOULD BE FUN OR NUMBER TWO IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN A SIMPLER KIND OF LECTURE HECTOR BEFORE BEDTIME THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN BE
IT'S NOT JUST A LECTURE IT'S MORE OF A SHOWING JUST MORE UNCONVENTIONAL MODELS TO IT TO YOUNG GIRLS BECAUSE MOST OF THE CHILDREN'S BOOKS THAT COME OUT EVERY EVERY YEAR STEALS SHOW MOSTLY MALE SAYS DOMAIN CHARACTERS AND OF COURSE IF EVERYTHING YOU SEE AROUND YOU
JUST KEEPS SHOWING ME MAIN CHARACTERS AS THE MAIN PROTAGONISTS OF COURSE USE YOU START BELIEVING THAT MAYBE YOU YOU CAN'T BE IN CHARGE OF YOUR OWN DESTINY SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE WITH THIS MARK

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE NINETEENTH OF MAY THE HEADLINES AND EGYPTIAN AIRLINER WITH SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD ONE OF THEM BRITISH HAS DISAPPEARED ON A FLIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO A MAJOR REVIEW OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE HAS CONCLUDED THAT SUPERBUGS COULD KILL ONE PERSON EVERY THREE SECONDS WORLDWIDE BY TWENTY FIFTY AND A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF CONDUCTING VICIOUS BRIEFINGS AGAINST THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY ZEB SENDS AN EGYPT AIRPLANE FLYING OVERNIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO HAS DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR SCREENS OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES SAY THERE WERE SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD INCLUDING ONE BRITISH CITIZEN SEARCH TEAMS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO THE AREA ACCORDING TO ONE UNCONFIRMED REPORT THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP WHICH WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES SOUTH OF THE GREEK ISLAND OF CAN'T HAVE THIS REPORTED SEEING A FLAME IN THE SKY IS A CORRESPONDENT CATRIONA RENTON
THE EGYPT HERE FLIGHT LEFT CHARLES TO CALL AIRPORT JUST BEFORE TEN PAST ELEVEN YESTERDAY EVENING THE AIRLINE SAID THEY WERE FIFTY SIX PASSENGERS INCLUDING ONE CHILD AND TWO BABIES AS WELL AS TEN CREW ONBOARD FLOAT M.S. EIGHT OH FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE PASSENGERS WERE FROM EGYPT FIFTEEN WHERE FRENCH AND THERE WAS ALSO ONE BRITISH CITIZEN
EGYPT DEAR SAID THE AIRBUS A. THREE TWENTY LOST CONTACT WITH THE RADAR AS A QUARTER TO THREE THIS MORNING CAIRO TIME TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS SCHEDULED TO LAND IN THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL THE AIRLINE SAYS THE PLANE DISAPPEARED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN TEN MILES INTO EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE

OF THE CODE PURPLE THIRTY PANIC
I'M GOING TO GO
IT VERY VERY QUICKLY
COULD WELL BE AN EXPLOSION ON BOARD BUT THIS IS PURE SPECULATION
A MAJOR REVIEW OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE SET UP BY DAVID CAMERON AS WE THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY SUPERBUGS COULD KILL ONE PERSON EVERY THREE SECONDS WORLDWIDE AND ESTHER'S URGENT ACTION THE STUDY SAYS DOCTORS SHOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT TESTS BEFORE PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS TO CHECK WITH THE PATIENTS ACTUALLY NEED THEM IS OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WALSH
IN THE TWO YEARS THIS REVIEW HAS TAKEN THE TEAM INVOLVED ESTIMATE AROUND A MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE HAVE DIED FROM DRUG RESISTANT INFECTIONS BUT IT WARNED THAT THIS COULD RISE TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR MORE THAN DIE FROM CANCER UNLESS THE WORLD TACKLES THE SUPERBUG CRISIS
THE REPORT CALLS FOR A GLOBAL PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SO THAT PATIENTS DO NOT DEMAND ANTIBIOTICS WHEN THERE'S NO NEED IT ALSO ONCE A MAJOR REDUCTION IN ANTIBIOTIC USE IN FARM ANIMALS NEW ANTI MICROBIAL AS ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED AND IT SAYS THERE SHOULD BE BIG FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP EFFECTIVE DRUGS
ANTIBIOTICS ARE PERHAPS THE MOST PRECIOUS MEDICINES WE HAVE IF THEY'RE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE IT WILL REQUIRE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION TO CONSERVE THEIR USE AND TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTIONS THAT FUELLED THE RISE OF SUPERBUGS
A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BRECK'S HAD CAMPAIGNERS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET ARE VICIOUSLY BRIEFING AGAINST TORIES IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. STEVE BAKER THE M.P. WHO CO CHAIRS THE CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN CAMPAIGN GROUP ONE NUMBER TEN'S ACTIONS WRIST LEAVING THE PARTY WITH DEEP DIVISIONS IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
SUCH IS THE FEROCITY OF THE CRITICISM BETWEEN THE RIVAL TORY CAMPS IN THIS REFERENDUM MANY SENIOR CONSERVATIVES FEAR IT MAY PROVE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO RE UNITE THE PARTY AFTERWARDS TODAY MISTER BAKER IN EFFECT CALLS FOR A TRUCE PERSONAL NASTINESS MUST END HE SAYS IF WE'RE TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN HOWEVER HIS WORDS MAY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT SINCE HE POINTS THE FINGER OF BLAME SQUARELY AT THE REMAINED SIDE FOR FUELLING THE VITRIOL
HE SAYS THEY'VE BEEN GUILTY OF INSULTS PERSONAL ATTACKS AND TABLOID SMEARS HE SIGHTS IN PARTICULAR THE ONSLAUGHT BY LORD HESELTINE ON BORIS JOHNSON THE CLAIM BY SIR JOHN MAJOR THAT BRECHT SAID CAMPAIGNERS WERE MORPHING INTO UKIP AND THE CHANCELLOR'S SUGGESTION THAT HIS OPPONENTS WERE ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE
DOWNING STREET HAVE DISMISSED THE CLAIMS AND INSIST THEIR CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ROOTED IN THE ARGUMENTS SOURCES I'VE ALSO REJECTED SUGGESTIONS THEY PROMPTED LORD HESELTINE TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS AND SAY HE WAS INVITED TO DO SO BY THE B.B.C.
THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS TO BALLET IS MEMBERS ABOUT WHETHER TO ACCEPT HER DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS TO END THE DISPUTE OVER A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND DOCTORS HAVE HELD A SERIES OF STRIKES INCLUDING TWO ALL OUT STOPPAGES IN WHICH JUNIOR MEDICS WITHDREW EMERGENCY CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAD THREATENED TO IMPOSE THEIR CONTRACT A HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM REPORTS
WILL BE FURTHER SCRUTINY OF THE AGREEMENT OVER THE JUNIOR DOCTOR CONTRACT TODAY INCLUDING IN THE COMMONS WHERE JEREMY HUNT WILL SPELL OUT THE DETAILS TO EM PEAS THERE'S BEEN A SCEPTICAL REACTION AMONG SOME DOCTORS WITH CALLS FOR MORE REASSURANCES OVER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO EXTEND N.H.S. SERVICES OVER SEVEN DAYS WILL MEAN FOR WORKING HOURS B.M.A. MEMBERS WILL STUDY CAREFULLY THE DEAL AND THE NEW CONTRACT BEFORE VOTING WITH A RESULT IN JULY FAR FROM A FOREGONE CONCLUSION
BUT YESTERDAY'S AGREEMENT WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD WITH BOTH SIDES SEEMINGLY FAR APART JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE B.M.A. EACH ARGUE THEY'VE STRUCK A GOOD DEAL WITH MANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ORIGINAL PROPOSALS NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE DOCTOR'S TO DELIVER THEIR VERDICT
LEADING RESEARCHERS FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SYMPTOMS OF A MINOR STROKES YOU TAKE ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE MEDICAL JOURNAL THE LANCET CONCLUDES THAT THE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF PREVENTING OR LIMITING THE HARM CAUSED BY FURTHER STROKES HAVE BEEN HUGELY UNDERESTIMATED THEY SAID ADVICE FOR DOCTORS AND FOR THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE CLARIFIED IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MINOR STROKE OR TEMPORARY SYMPTOMS HAVE A HIGH RISK OF A MAJOR STROKE SOON AFTERWARDS PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED ASPIRIN COULD PLAY SOME PART IN REDUCING THE RISK THIS STUDY CONCLUDES IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT PARTICULARLY IN THE CRUCIAL HOURS AND DAYS AFTER SYMPTOMS SHOW CUTTING THE RISK OF MAJOR STROKES BY EIGHTY PERCENT AND WHERE THEY DO OCCUR REDUCING THEIR SEVERITY
DO YOU WANT US WANT GUIDANCE FOR DOCTORS TO BE UPDATED SO IT'S CLEAR ASPIRIN SHOULD BE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY THEY SAY THIS MESSAGE SHOULD ALSO BE PUT OUT TO THE PUBLIC SO IF PEOPLE HAVE SYMPTOMS THEY KNOW TO CALL FOR HELP AND TAKE AN ASPIRIN
THE BENEFITS THEY SAY A POTENTIALLY HUGE N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS THE FINDINGS WILL NEED TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED NEW STROKE GUIDELINES FOR DOCTORS ARE DUE OUT IN THE AUTUMN
THE PENTAGON SAYS TO CHINESE FIGHTERS CONDUCTED AN UNSAFE INTERCEPT OF A U.S. SPY PLANE OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IS SAYS THE JETS FLEW SO CLOSE TO THE AMERICAN PILOT HE WAS FORCED TO DESCEND IN ORDER TO AVOID A COLLISION CHINESE DEFENCE MINISTRY SAYS IT'S LOOKING INTO THE REPORTS ARE NORTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT DAVID WILLIS REPORTS
THE PENTAGON SAYS A U.S. MARITIME PATROL RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WAS CONDUCTING WHAT IT CALLS ROUTINE OPERATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA SOUTH OF HONG KONG AS IT DID SO TO CHINESE J. ELEVEN FIGHTER JETS CAME WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE PLANE SO CLOSE THE PENTAGON SAYS THAT THE AMERICAN PILOT HAD TO DESCEND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IN ORDER TO AVOID HITTING THEM
A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S SHIPPING GOES THROUGH THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND THE REGION IS THOUGHT TO BE RICH IN OIL AND GAS RESERVES SIX NATIONS LAY CLAIM TO AT LEAST PART OF THE TERRITORY BUT IN RECENT YEARS CHINA HAS ASSERTED ITS CLAIM TO ALMOST THE ENTIRE AREA
THE SUPREME COURT WILL TODAY DELIVER ITS JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER TO LIFT AN INJUNCTION FORBIDDING THE NAMING OF A CELEBRITY INVOLVED IN AN EXTRAMARITAL RELATIONSHIP THE CASE BROUGHT BY THE SUN ON SUNDAY HAS DRAWN ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON THE LAW PROTECTING PRIVACY IN ENGLAND AND WALES
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN EGYPT HAS CONFIRMED THAT ONE BRITISH PERSON WAS ON BOARD THEIR FLIGHT BUT DISAPPEARED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN EN ROUTE TO CAIRO FROM PARIS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING
THERE WERE ALSO THIRTY FRENCH AMONG THE SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD WELL WE'RE JOINED FROM PARIS BY HUGH SCHOFIELD A CORRESPONDENT HUGH WHAT IS WHAT ARE THEY SAYING THEY'RE WHAT IS BOTH EGYPT AND OF THE FRENCH SAYING THERE ABOUT THIS FLIGHT AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT
YEAH WELL IT WAS A SCHEDULED FLIGHT M.S. EIGHT OH FOUR WHICH LEFT SHOULDER GOAL AT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT SO AN OVERNIGHT FLIGHT TO CAIRO AS YOU SAID SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD FIFTY SIX PASSENGERS TEN CREW INCLUDING THREE SECURITY AGENTS AMONG THAT CREW FIFTEEN FRENCH THAT EGYPTIANS ONE BRITAIN AND THE REST VARIOUS OTHER NATIONALITIES AND ANYWAY CONTACT WAS LOST
WHEN THE PLANE WAS ABOUT FIFTY KILOMETRES THIRTY MILES NORTH OF THE FRIEND OF THE EGYPTIAN COAST JUST MOVED INTO EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE SO THE CRUISING ALTITUDE SO MUST BE ABOUT THEN TO START ITS DESCENT TOWARDS CAIRO THERE WAS NO ALARM NO WARNING GIVEN NO ALERT RAISED BY THE PILOTS THESE WEBSITES WHICH TRACK COMMERCIAL PLANES
HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO LOSS OF ALTITUDE OR SPEED IN OTHER WORDS EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE GOING PERFECTLY NORMALLY AND THEN THERE WAS THIS LOSS OF CONTACT WITH
THE GROUND SO SPECULATION OF COURSE IS OF THE MOST PESSIMISTIC NATURE BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION ON BOARD ESSENTIALLY I THINK MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO BE DISCARDING THE THEORY OF AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS IN GOOD NICK THE PILOT WAS VERY EXPERIENCED AND SAUNTERED IN THERE THE MAIN THEORY IS AN ACT OF TERRORISM AT THE MOMENT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE
EGYPTIAN BOATS PLANES AND PROBABLY THOSE OF OTHER NATIONALITIES GREEKS ARE HEADING TOWARDS THE SCENE FIFTY KILOMETRES NORTH OF THE GHOST OF THAT YOU HAD TO SEE WHAT THERE IS THERE AND WILL KNOW I SUSPECT QUITE SHORTLY WHAT THERE IS TO BE SEEN BECAUSE THAT WILL BE THE NEXT THING WHEN THEY START FINDING WRECKAGE
WELL I MEAN IF WE SORT OF STICK WITH ITS PESSIMISTIC THEORY THEN THAT WOULD BE WHAT THEY FIND MAYBE IT'S OVER A VERY LARGE SPACE HE MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME TO FIND OUT BUT THE FACT THE PAIN'S COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED FROM RADARS THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING AT ALL NO SIGN OF TROUBLE AND OBVIOUSLY PROMPTS THE
THE CONCLUSION OF THE THEORY THAT THE PLANE BLEW UP SUDDENLY OH SOMETHING HAPPENED ON BOARD FOR VIOLENT NATURE AND THEREFORE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE FOUND ON THE SEA BELOW SO YES I MEAN THAT'S WHAT MAKES SETTLE THE OCEAN AND THE NEXT QUESTION OF COURSE IS WHY WHY THERE WOULD BE AN EXPLOSION ON BOARD THAT IS GOING TO BE WE'RE GONNA BE SOMEWHERE WAVE PRESUMABLY FROM BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT
SO WE NEED TO WRAP EVERYTHING UP WITH CAVEATS EITHER THE PRIME MINISTER HERE IS NO THEORY THEORY'S BEEN DISCARDED AND SO ON BUT I MEAN ONE CAN'T HELP BUT SPECULATE GIVEN GIVEN THAT IT'S HAD
EGYPT AND FRANCE FOR THAT MATTER IN BOTH COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF TASMIN IN EGYPT OF COURSE THE OTHER THE SHARMA SHEIK CRYER EXPLOSION WITH THE RUSSIAN I THINK WAS A BIT MORE GO IN THE MILLS AT HIJACK LAST THE END OF LAST YEAR THAT WENT TO CYPRUS SO THEIR TARGET THE FRENCH OF COURSE I'VE BEEN A TARGET THIS WAS A PLANE FROM FRANCE TO EGYPT YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN ONE CAN DRAW OBVIOUS
CONCLUSION DO SPECULATION ABOUT THAT QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT WAS IT WAS A DIBBER DEVICE BROUGHT ON WAS IT SOMEONE WHO BROUGHT SOMETHING ON IN PERSON WITH SOMETHING PLANTED ON THAT ON THE PLANE IF THAT WAS THE CASE WHERE SHALL THE BALL OR WHERE THE PLANE BEEN BEFORE THAT WAS HE JUST A LEG BETWEEN CAIRO AND PROP FRANCE OR LIBERAL IN EGYPT ALL THIS WILL BE A MATTER FOR INTENSE INVESTIGATION HUGH SCHOFIELD THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S ALL TOO NASTY THAT'S WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. STEVE BAKER ARE SAYING THIS MORNING ABOUT THE DOWNING STREET RUN CAMPAIGN TO KEEP US IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MISTER BAKER WHO WAS A LEADING LIGHT IN THE CAMPAIGN TO GET US OUT HAS WRITTEN A PIECE FOR THE WEBSITE CONSERVATIVE HOME IN WHICH HE SAYS THIS ISN'T THE DEBATE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MISTER BAKER IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SPECIFICALLY HAS WORRIED YOU WELL I'VE NAMED THREE THINGS THREE ATTACK LORD HESELTINE CARRIED OUT ON BORIS JOHNSON BRINGING HIS LEADERSHIP INTO PLAY IN SAYING IT
WAS LOSING HIS JUDGEMENT'S THE CHANCELLOR DESCRIBING A FORMER CHANCERS A FORMER LEADER OF A PARTY IS ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE AND ALSO JOHN MAJOR SAYING WE WERE FUELLING PRETTY PREJUDICE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHEN IN FACT WE TRIED EXTREMELY HARD TO POINT OUT FOR EXAMPLE THAT BRITISH CITIZENS WITH FAMILY OUTSIDE THE E.U. FACE CATEGORICALLY DIFFERENT MIGRATION WHAT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE SAYS THAT'S ALL JUST ROBUST STUFF
FOR BORIS JOHNSON AT MENTION HITLER ER PERFECTLY PLAIN NOW OBVIOUS THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF COME BACK ON THAT ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE WELL POLITICIANS OFTEN CALL EACH OTHER ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN MAKING YOUR COMPLAINT THIS MORNING HE'S RAISING THE WHITE FLAG YOU CAN'T HACK IT NOT AT ALL I THINK IT'S QUITE THE REVERSE I THINK THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAVE REALISED
THAT THEY'RE LOSING THE ARGUMENTS THAT PAINTED INTO A CORNER AND NOW THEY'RE LASHING OUT INDIVIDUALS BUT WE'RE NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT THEIR RENEGOTIATION WHY BECAUSE IT BECAME RIDICULOUS EVEN ON THIS PROGRAMME I HEARD ONE OF YOU SAY IN HER SIDE ARE WE STILL CALLING THIS A RENEGOTIATION IT BECAME RIDICULOUS THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE AN HONEST AND POSITIVE CASE FOR THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW YOU CITIZENSHIP OR COMMON TRADE POLICY AND ALL THE REST BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S A LOSING ARGUMENT AND SO
WE'VE BEEN REDUCED TO FEAR UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT ON THEIR REMAINS SIDE AND LASHING OUT INDIVIDUALS YOU SAY LASHING OUT INTO A JIG YOU IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ACCUSED THE EUROPE MINISTER OF PUNISHING POO I DID I KNEW I DID IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BE SEEN AMUSING YOU'RE LAUGHING NOW I KNEW IT WOULD BE AMUSING AND ONE OF THE SUDDENLY STUMPED HIM AND I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY GOOD I DON'T KNOW THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE ON BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN PRETTY LOW BROW AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE
I THINK THAT'S IT ALL OF US ASPIRE TO HAVE A HIGH QUALITY DEBATE ON THE FACTS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT'S O.K. I KNOW THAT WELL INDEED THE WAY IT KICKED OFF I REMEMBER BEING IN A STUDIO AND THE WAY IT KICKED OFF WITH WITH THE REMAIN SIDE SAYING THAT THEY WERE THE PATRIOTS AND WE WERE THE QUITTERS WE MANAGED TO DESTROY THAT LINE WITHIN HALF A DAY IS AN INSULTING LYING TO BEGIN WITH I TAKE FOR GRANTED THE PATRIOTISM THE LOVE THE COUNTRY THE GENERAL GOOD FELLOW FEELING OF EVERY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE OF COURSE
AND THE IDEA THAT WE'RE QUITTERS IS SILLY ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS A MARKET ECONOMY KNOWS THEIR EXIT FROM UNSATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENTS IS HOW YOU BUILD A BETTER SOCIETY SO THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN FROM THE RAIN REMAIN SIDE BY TRYING TO POSITION ASKED US AS QUITTERS ARE NOT PATRIOTIC WHAT THEY WILL SAY BEHIND THE SCENES IS LOOK WE NEED TO WIN THIS DOWNING STREET WE NEED TO WIN THIS ON THE REMAIN SIGN WE WILL DO IT AND WILL USE WHATEVER MEANS WE CAN AND THEN AFTERWARDS
WE'LL SAY O.K. LE'S FORGET EVERYONE COME BACK TOGETHER IT'LL BE FINE ARE YOU SAYING THIS MORNING IT WON'T BE WHAT I'M SAYING IS PLEASE DON'T ANYONE ANYONE ON ANY SIDE FOLLOW A SCORCHED EARTH POLICY BECAUSE WE SPENT I SPENT PERSONALLY ABOUT NINE MONTHS BUILDING CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY REMAINED ON GOOD TERMS
AND THAT CANNOT BE PUT AT RISK THEY'VE BEEN TOO MANY INSTANCES WHERE COMMENT IN THE PRESS FROM A CAMPAIGNER HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY ATTACKS ON THEM PERSONALLY THAT MUST STOP THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE FIND HARD YES BUT IF YOU LOSE WELL YOU SEE HE'S FOUND HARDIMAN POLITICS IS A TOUGH BUSINESS THEY WILL FIND IT HARD OF COURSE BUT THEN ONCE THEY'VE LOST IF THEY DO LOSE IF YOUR SIDE WORK TO LOSE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT STILL YOU'D NEED TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND EVERYONE WOULD FALL INTO LINE EVEN BORIS JOHNSON AFTER ALL THESE ATTACKS WOULD FALL INTO
WELL OF COURSE I AGREE THAT WE MUST GET BACK TOGETHER THAT'S WHY I'VE TAKEN THIS STEP BUT WHAT I ESSENTIALLY I'M SAYING HE'S QUEENSBERRY RULES SO FULL FRONTAL ASSAULT WOULD YOU WARNING IS FINE BUT THE DAGGER IN THE HEART STARTED FROM THE BACK THROUGH WHISPERING IN DARK CORRIDORS IS NOT OUT TERESA SOMEONE SAYS MENTIONS HITLER THEN IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY TO USE THE WORD PREPOSTEROUS ABOUT HIM WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WAS WAS AN ANY REASONABLE HISTORICAL CATALOGUE
OF EFFORTS TO UNITE EUROPE POLITICALLY WILL INCLUDE THE EVENTS THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND THAT'S ALL YOU THINK RICE JOHNSON WAS RIGHT TOO I THINK HORACE JOHNSON DID WE THINK IT WAS RIGHT I THINK WHAT HE DID WAS CATALOGUE HISTORICAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WAS HE RIGHT BUT HE DID HE WAS HE DID NOT THE HYSTERICAL REACTION WHICH HE EARNED FROM LORD HESELTINE NOW THING I'M NOT SAYING HE WAS RIGHT TO USE IT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IN THE WORDS THAT HE USED WHICH I FEEL SURE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU
HE JUST SIMPLY CATALOGUED HISTORICALLY EFFORTS TO UNITE EUROPE POLITICALLY NOW PERSONALLY I WOULDN'T BOTHER USING THE H. WORD BUT BORIS WAS SIMPLY HISTORICALLY CATALOGUING ATTEMPTS TO UNITE EUROPE POLITICALLY WHAT HE WAS NOT DOING HE WAS NOT COMPARING THE PROJECTS OF THAT PARTICULAR REGIME STEEP EGG THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MINOR STROKE HAVE A HIGH RISK OF A MAJOR STROKE SOON AFTERWARDS BUT IF THEY TAKE ASPIRIN THAT RISK IS REDUCED BY EIGHTY PER CENT THERE FIND IT COMES FROM NEW RESEARCH BY OXFORD UNIVERSITY IT'S PUBLISHED IN THE LANCET AND WE'RE JOINED BY PETER ROTHWELL HE'S PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY AT OXFORD AND OVERSAW THE STUDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THIS IS QUITE STRIKING FINDINGS THE DIFFERENCES IF YOU TAKE US
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER EFFECT THAN WE THAN WE EXPECTED OF COURSE THE RELEVANCE OF IT IS THAT THERE'S ASPIRIN IN NEARLY EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE COUNTRY SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CAN BE DONE VERY QUICKLY AFTER PEOPLE DEVELOP SYMPTOMS AND WHAT ARE THOSE SYMPTOMS
A MINI STROKE IS REALLY THE SAME AS WHAT WE'RE FOR MORE FAMILIAR WITH US AS A BIG STROKE BUT THE SYMPTOMS ARE MILDER AND OFTEN TRANSIENT SO YOU MIGHT FOR EXAMPLE GET SOME SPEECH DIFFICULTIES SOME SLURRED SPEECH LITTLE BIT OF FACIAL WEAKNESS YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME VISUAL DISTURBANCE WEAK HAND
DIFFICULTY TO BALANCE THE KEY THING IS THAT IT COMES ON SUDDENLY AND IT'S IT'S UNACCUSTOMED YOU'VE NOT HAD THIS BEFORE AND YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT SO ANY SUDDEN ONSET TRANSIENT NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORTH SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION ABOUT HIM AND TAKING AN ASPIRIN JUST IN CASE SO DO PEOPLE ALWAYS KNOW THAT THEY'VE HAD A MINISTRY
NO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH A BIG STROKE IT IT'S OBVIOUS THEY CALL NINE NINE NINE IF THEY CAN THEY GO STRAIGHT TO HOSPITAL ABOUT HALF THE PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WITH WITH MINOR EVENTS EITHER DON'T SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION AT ALL AND ONLY PRESENT HAVE TO THEY HAVE A RECURRENCE STROKE OR THEY DELAY FOR SEVERAL DAYS SOMETIMES AND SO IT'S THAT GROUPWARE WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT BUT I SUPPOSE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT ASPENS NOT GONNA DO YOU ANY HARM ANYWAY SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE ANY SIGNS OF THESE SYMPTOMS TAKEN ASPIRIN
ABSOLUTELY IF YOU HAVE A MAJOR STROKE THEN THERE IS THERE IS A RISK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BLEED AND SO THE ADVICE AFTER A BIG STROKE IS IS NOT TO TAKE ASPIRIN UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN SEEN IN HOSPITAL BUT AFTER A MINOR EVENT ARE SORT OF WALKING WOUNDED TYPE STROKE OR A TRANSIENT EVENT THEN THE RISK WOULD BE VERY LOW OF TAKING ASPIRIN FOR A A DEITY IS THIS THE SORT OF THING THAT YOUR DOCTOR'S GOING TO BE ADVISING YOU TO DO ANYWAY
AT THE MOMENT PATIENTS OFTEN DON'T GET THAT ADVICE THEY MIGHT RING UP THE G.P. WHO ARRANGES A HOSPITAL APPOINTMENT THE NEXT DAY SOMETIMES OR THE RING ONE ONE ONE AND THEY PAY OFTEN DON'T GET TOLD TO TAKE ASPIRIN SO WE'D BE TRYING TO GET THE GUIDELINES UPDATED TO SAY THAT AS SOON AS A PATIENT SEEKS MEDICAL ATTENTION IF ESAS SUSPICION OF A MINI STROKE THEY SHOULD BE ADVISED TO TAKE ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY
AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF IT THAT IT WILL THIN THE BLOOD WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE THEN ON PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES
WELL THERE IS THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF A MAJOR STROKE IN THOSE FIRST FEW HOURS AND AND DAYS AFTER THESE MINOR WARNING SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS ARE REALLY ON A KNIFE EDGE SHEEP THEY CAN TIP FORWARD INTO A VERY BIG DISABLING MORE FATAL STROKE OR THEY CAN BE TIPPED BACK FAIRLY EASILY BY SOMETHING LIKE ASPIRIN JUST TO MAKE THE BLOOD LESS STICKY AND REDUCE THE RISK OF A BIG STROKE
PROFESSOR ROTHWELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE IT'S MY SEVEN ROYAL MAIL HAVE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT RESULTS FOR THE AIR ROB YEUNG IS HERE WITH THEM WHAT A GOOD MORNING YES THE VOLUME OF LETTERS DELIVERED BY ROYAL MAIL CONTINUES TO SLIDE DOWN THREE PER CENT LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF PARCELS IT HANDLED GREW THOUGH BY THE SAME AMOUNT AGAIN THANKS TO ONLINE SHOPPING IT'S EUROPEAN BUSINESS HAS DONE INCREDIBLY WELL AGAIN ROYAL MAIL SAYS IT ANNUAL ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE TRANSFORMATION COST RAISE FIVE PER CENT T. SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION POUNDS ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE
THE COMPANY HAS SHOWN A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE IN CHALLENGING MARKETS WITH US STEPHEN GIBSON A FORMER POSTAL REGULATOR WHO NOW RUNS THE CONSULTANCY AT ALGAE ECONOMICS GOOD MORNING MORNING SO HOW CHALLENGING WHAT'S YOUR OVERALL ASSESSMENT A ROYAL MAIL'S PERFORMANCE WELL IT'S A BIT OF A MIXED BAG WHAT YOU SEEN IS VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN G. L. S. THE INTERNATIONAL PAT PARCELS OPERATOR
BUT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING NOT JUST IN THE LETTERS MARKET WOULD HAVE BEEN IN LONG TERM DECLINE FOR FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS NOW BUT IN PARCELS WHILE THEY ARE GROWING THEY'RE NOT GROWING AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE MARKET MARK IS GOING FOUR TO FIVE PER CENT PER ANNUM AND THEY'VE ONLY GROWING THEIR REVENUES BY ONE PER CENT SO THAT IS A REAL ONGOING PROBLEM RIGHT THERE'S NO LET UP IN THE DECLINE OF THE LETTER IS THE FEATURE OF THE DAILY POSTAL DELIVERY SECURE
WELL IT IS FOR THE TIME BEING BUT THE COMPANY IS VERY MUCH BEING SUPPORTED BY THAT GROWTH IN EUROPEAN POTTERS TO THE EUROPEAN PARCELS MARKET AND THEY REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW THAT THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCT RANGE IN THE U.K. TO SUPPORT THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE SO THE PARCELS DELIVERY BUSINESS IN EUROPE IS ESSENTIALLY SUPPORTING IN YOUR VIEW THE FINANCES OF THE DAILY DELIVERY HERE ABSOLUTELY
HOW IS ROYAL MAIL FARING AGAINST THE LIKES OF AMAZON WHICH NOW IS DELIVERING MORE AND MORE OF ITS OWN PARCELS THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGER STRATEGIC THREATS TO ROYAL MAIL ONE OF THEM WITH THEIR BIGGEST CUSTOMER HAS BEEN AMAZON IN TERMS OF ONLINE PARCEL DELIVERY AND MEMBERS AND ARE NOW MOVING TO
THEIR OWN DELIVERY THAT THEIR OWN AMAZON LOGISTICS OPERATORS WHO OPERATE AT A LOWER RATE THAN ROYAL MAIL CHILD PAYS FOR IT POSTMEN AND POST WOMEN AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE LOSING MARKET SHARE THAT IS A REAL STRATEGIC THREAT NOW THERE IS A REVIEW INTO THE REGULATION OF ROYAL MAIL BYE
OFCOM IS THE AIM OF THIS TO HELP ROYAL MAIL OR TO HELP INTRODUCE RIVALS TO ROYAL
THE AIM IS TO HELP CUSTOMERS OFCOM'S DUTY IS TO HELP CUSTOMERS AND TO PRESERVE THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE THAT WILL MEAN
USING COMPETITION WHICH MEANS ENCOURAGING RIVALS WHERE THAT THINKS THEY WEAR OFCOM THINKS THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY SO THESE REGULATORY CHANGES THAT COULD PERHAPS MAKE LIFE FOR ROYAL MAIL EVEN WORSE IT COULD MAKE IT CERTAINLY MORE CHALLENGING AND WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN THEN FOR THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATION TO DELIVER POST TO MOST OF US EVERY DAY
NO I THINK THE THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATION TO DELIVER TO EVERY ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY SIX DAYS A WEEK IS SECURE HE REQUIRES A CHANGED PRIME LEGISLATION FOR THAT BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT ROW MALCOLM FACE TIGHTER REGULATION PRICE CAPS EXCEPT TRES THANK YOU STEVEN STEVEN GIBSON FROM S.L. G. ECONOMICS
THEY WERE A SHRUB TIME TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN ELECTED MAYORS OF ENGLISH CITIES INCLUDING MANCHESTER BIRMINGHAM BRISTOL I'M GOING TO GET THE POWER TO CONTROL THE BUSES IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH YESTERDAY THAT RELAY BUS SERVICES MIGHT STILL BE PROVIDED BY SEPARATE PRIVATE COMPANIES THE MARES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPECIFY THE SERVICE OPERATES AS A SINGLE REGIONAL BUS SERVICE
COMMON BRAND NAME COMMON COLOUR SCHEME ON EVERY BUS JUST LIKE LONDON AT THAT AMONG THE CITY'S GETTING A METRO AND PERHAPS A SHINY NEW BUS SERVICE IS LIVERPOOL HAS SEEN A POTENTIAL REPORTS
IN THIS CITY EIGHTY PER CENT OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT JOURNEYS ARE MADE
THE BUSES ARE IN CHARGE OF THE TICKET PRICES TIMETABLES AND RUTH
I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR MATCHING FROM THE B.B.C.
DAVE'S BEEN DRIVING BUSES FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS AND SAYS NEW RULES MEAN HE'S GOT TO GET FROM ONE STOP TO ANOTHER QUICKER THE RUNNING SAM'S I'VE GOT SHORTER AND SHORTER SO YOU HAD TO DRIVE FAST
IT DOES THERE IS MORE DISTRESSED EBB OBVIOUSLY WE'VE GOT THE THE TRAFFIC SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THE THAT'S THE PRESSURE OBVIOUSLY TO GO FROM ON TOP LIKE TO ANOTHER
HE WANTS CHANGE AND HE MIGHT JUST GET THAT CHANGE NEXT YEAR IS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO DEVOLVE POWERS FROM WESTMINSTER TO THE REGIONS A NEW METRO MAYOR WILL BE ELECTED
DECIDE HOW THE CITY'S BUSES ON
I MEAN DOES IT MEAN THE PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP ON THE BUSES BECAUSE IT'S GOING UP PRETTY FAST AS IT IS EACH YEAR
DO YOU EVER TAKE THE BUS NO I GET THE TRAIN THE TRAIN'S NOT ALIVE ON THE BUSES BUSES TENDS CANTANKEROUS TRAFFIC ET-CETERA
MANY HERE ALTER WHERE AS THIS NEW POST BUT A RECENT POLL CARRIED OUT IN FIVE OF THE REGIONS THAT COULD HAVE METRO SECTION
FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE QUESTIONED WERE IN FAVOUR OF GIVING THEM MORE POWERS THAN THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS
ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE CUNARD BUILDING NOT FAR FROM THE WATERFRONT WE MEET JOE ANDERSON CURRENTLY MAYOR BUT ALSO A CANDIDATE FOR METRO
HE WANTS TO BRING BUS FARES DOWN AND SAYS IT'S AFFORDABLE
I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN LOCALISM I THINK I MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT ME THAN SOME WHITE ALL MONTH HE HASN'T SEEN LIVERPOOL ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS THAT THESE NEW METRO MAYORS WILL JUST HAVE FAR TOO MUCH TO DO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE I MEAN A GOOD LEAD THAT MAKE SURE THAT THEY DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITIES TO PEOPLE AND AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT A ALL ASKED ENVISIONED THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT THINGS CAN BE DELIVERED AND THINGS CAN BE MADE TO HAPPEN
CRITICS ARE DEVOLUTION SAY THE METRO MAYOR ROLE IS LEADING THE PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE FOR THE GOOD OF THE LOCAL POPULATION WHEN ACTUALLY THEY SAY HITTING TARGETS AND ACHIEVING GOALS REQUIRES MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS AND BEING DIPLOMATIC
WHAT I WANT IS A BETTER INTEGRATED TRANSPORT SYSTEM THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE AREA NOT NECESSARILY THE NEEDS OF THE COMPANIES THAT WERE ON THEM IT'S ALL VERY WELL BUT YOU WON'T LISTEN YOU WHAT
AT THE END OF THE DAY IS IT REALLY THAT EASY TO DO THAT COURSE A VISIT'S ABSOLUTELY EASY YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THE BOSS THERE FOR SOME GOING TO BE MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE FOR INSTANCE IN MY CABINET WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE WE HAVE TRANSPORT THE
IS KEY IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE NEW MAYOR OF LONDON SIDIQUE KHAN HAS ALREADY MADE SOME CHANGES IN HOW BUSES ARE RUN IN THE CAPITAL
DEVOLUTION MAY SOUND PROMISING BUT THERE ARE QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER IT CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT LOCAL COUNCILS AND BUSINESSES HAVE FAILED TO DEAL WITH
IT'S A STUDENT HAIR WHY DON'T USE THE BUS BECAUSE TRAINS ARE EASIER AND THE QUICKER AND THE CHEAPER AND THEY DON'T SMELL I USED TO BOX LAST WEEK TO MONA WAS DISCUSSED OR THEY'VE GOT TO PUT THE CHESHIRE OAKS AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT I DO TAXIS
I'M A CLASSY BROAD EYE DETECTS THAT PEOPLE DID

A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BRECK'S IT CAMPAIGNER HAS WARNED THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE COULD DAMAGE THE PARTY STEVE BAKER THE M.P. WHO CO CHAIRS THE CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN CAMPAIGN GROUP SAID THE DISCUSSION HAD DESCENDED INTO INSULTS PERSONAL ATTACKS AND PETTY TABLOID SMEARS HE ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF BRIEFING AGAINST TORIES IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U.
DOWNING STREET HAS DISMISSED THE CLAIMS AND INSISTS ITS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ROOTED IN THE ARGUMENTS
THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS AN AGREEMENT REACHED WITH GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS EVER NEW CONTRACTS FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND IS THE BEST AND FINAL WAY TO END THE ROUT THE DOCTORS' UNION WILL NOW POLE ITS MEMBERS OVER WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE DEAL DOCTORS HAVE HELD A SERIES OF STRIKES INCLUDING TWO ALL OUT WHICH STOPPAGES OVER GOVERNMENT PLANS TO IMPOSE THE NEW WORKING CONDITIONS
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A MINOR STROKES YOU TAKE ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT OR LIMIT THE HARM CAUSED BY FURTHER STROKES ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY WRITING IN THE LANCET MEDICAL JOURNAL RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAID THE BENEFITS OF TAKING ASPIRIN AT AN EARLY STAGE OF THE TREATMENT HAVE BEEN HUGELY UNDERESTIMATED
THE SUPREME COURT WILL TODAY DELIVER ITS JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER TO LIFT AN INJUNCTION FORBIDDING THE NAMING OF A CELEBRITY INVOLVED IN AN EXTRAMARITAL RELATIONSHIP THE CASE BROUGHT BY THE SUN ON SUNDAY HAS DRAWN ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON THE LAW PROTECTING PRIVACY IN ENGLAND AND WALES
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT A MEANER ALI HAS HAD AN EMOTIONAL REUNION WITH HER MOTHER SHE'S ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETEEN SCHOOLGIRLS WHO WERE KIDNAPPED BY BOKO HARAM MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO AND SHE IS THE FIRST TO BE FOUND FOUND WITH HER FOUR MONTH OLD BABY GIRL ON THE EDGE OF THE SAND PIECE OF FOREST NEAR HER HOME DOWN OF CHIP BARK IN NORTH EAST NIGERIA
JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO I SPOKE TO HAS A BARNARD HE'S CHAIRMAN OF THE CHIP UP PARENTS ASSOCIATION THE LYING TO HIM WASN'T GREAT I'M AFRAID BUT HE TOLD ME AND MEENA IS IN GOOD HEALTH AND SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT HER FRIENDS WHO WERE STILL BEING HELD
ARE YOU HOPEFUL THAT HAVING FOUND HER IT WILL LEAD TO GETTING HOLD OF THESE OTHER GIRLS WHO WERE TAKEN
WHO CUTS COMMUNICATION SO AS SOON AS YOU INVOLVE THE GOVERNMENT THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU WELL CHARLES ATTIRE IS A B.B.C. JOURNALIST AND ASSOCIATE FELLOW AT CHATHAM HOUSE JOINS ME ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I MEAN IN THE SUGGESTION THERE CHARLOTTE IS THAT SHE MAY HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY RELEASED AS PART OF A NEGOTIATING TACTIC DO YOU DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU LIKE THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO
IT DEFINITELY DOES A MEAN MEN THE STORY PERCH YESTERDAY THE IMMEDIATE THING I THOUGHT WAS WELL IF IF BOOK HER ARMOUR HOLDING ALL THESE GIRLS UNDER KIND OF HEAVY ARM GUARDS HOW CAN THIS ONE PERSON WITH A CHILD BE ALLOWED TO SORT OF ROAM AROUND THE FOREST GATHERING FIREWOOD IT JUST SOUNDED REALLY REALLY STRANGE
SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S LOOKING MORE LIKELY THAT SHE WAS LET GO BY THE GROUP FOR A REASON OR AS PART OF A NEGOTIATION THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT SHE WAS WITH SOMEBODY CLAIMING TO BE HER HUSBAND WHO WAS A SUSPECTED FIGHTER WITH BOKO HARAM WERE YOU ABLE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT
WELL THE HUSBAND WASN'T IN THE STORY EARLY YESTERDAY WHEN IT BROKE THE TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE HUSBAND WAS WITH HER AND AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER INCONSISTENCY IN THIS STORY AND FINDING THE MORE I HEAR THAT THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS DOTS THAT NEED TO BE JOINED
AND UM HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT WHEN SHE SPOKEN TO THE MILITARY PROPERLY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO HER AND WE'VE GOT HER STORY WILL KNOW HOW THIS HAS COME TO BE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE STORY THAT THESE SIX DEAD BODIES THAT WERE APPARENTLY IN THE VICINITY WHO WERE THERE AND NOW WE'RE HEARING THAT ALL THE GIRLS ARE STILL ALIVE BAR SIX ALL THESE SIX BODIES SIX GIRLS OR WITH HER OVER THEY'LL RELEASE AT THE SAME TIME WAS SHE TRYING TO ESCAPE WHAT THEY ALL TRYING TO ESCAPE
WERE THEY THERE BEFORE I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW IT HOPEFULLY WILL FIND OUT MORE AS A STORY PROGRESSES BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE NEXT STEP BECAUSE AS WE HEARD FROM SOME PETER HAS A BHANA THE BOKO HARAM HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HIM CLEARLY WANTED TO OPEN NEGOTIATIONS BUT AS SOON AS HE INVOLVES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THEY CUT COMMUNICATION
BOOKER HURRAH AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE A GOOD LEGACY WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATIONS GOVERNMENTS PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS HAVE SPOKEN VERY VOCALLY ABOUT NOT WANTING TO NEGOTIATE WITH BOOKER HER ARM AND REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GHOSTS THEY'RE FACE THIS HOW CAN YOU NEGOTIATE WITH THESE PEOPLE
AND THEY'VE KIND OF INSTEAD RELIED ON HEAVY MILITARY POWER BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF REALLY GOOD ATTEMPTS A NEGOTIATION THAT GO ON BEHIND THE SCENES TO INVOLVE NON GOVERNMENT ACTORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO BOOK HER ON WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRUST WITH THE GROUP
AND THAT REALLY SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT APPROACHES ANY NEGOTIATION WE HAVE THEM THE GROUP OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT LIKE DEALING DIRECTLY WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR GOVERNMENT ACTORS SO THE GOVERNMENT REALLY SHOULD BE RELYING AND TRUSTING THESE THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE GROUP BECAUSE A GROUP OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF TRUST IN THEM BUT THE SUGGESTION FROM THIS GIRL THAT ALL THAT THOUGH THE AT THOSE WHO WERE TAKEN TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN LESS SIX KILLED ARE IN THIS FORTIFIED AREA IN THE FOREST THE ONLY WAY SURELY TO GET THEM OUT IS TO NEGOTIATE
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S ALSO I MEAN TO SORT OF BE A BIT OF A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE IS ALSO QUITE CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE GIRLS OFF AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW THEY GET THEM OUT AND REALLY THEY SHOULD BE PULLING TOGETHER THEIR RESOURCES AND USING THESE THIRD PARTIES IS NON STATE ACTORS TO TRY AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE GROUP BECAUSE
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF AERIAL BOMBARDMENTS EARNS A HEAVY MILITARY POWER AND THEN CLAIM IN VICTORIES IT'S NOT WORKING ALL THAT'S HAPPENING IS A GROUPIE SPLINTERING OFF INTO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND WREAKING HAVOC IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
SO REALLY THERE SHOULD BE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO THE GROUP WHO CAN ACTUALLY WORK TOWARDS RESOLVING THIS CRISIS THE FACT THEY WERE IN THIS SITUATION AT ALL DOES IT SUGGEST THAT BOKO HARAM IS UNDER SUCH PRESSURE THAT IT IS A SPENT FORCE
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR I WOULDN'T I'D BE I'D BE QUITE SCEPTICAL ABOUT THAT THEIR TACTIC IS TO IS TO RETREAT WHEN THEY COME UNDER HEAVY BOMBARDMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE MILITARY SO THEY RETREAT THEY GO QUIET AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY KIND OF DO THIS KIND OF WEIRD HIGH FIVE CAMPAIGN AND LAUNCH HEAVY PROPAGANDA SAYING THE TERRORISTS ON THE BACK FOOT WHERE WINNING BLAH BLAH BLAH BUT THEN WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS USE THE HERO OF LONE ATTACKS OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS OR SHOOTINGS
AND THESE THINGS ARE VERY SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE WAY BOOK OR HER I'M USED TO OPERATE BEFORE WHEN THEY'D HAVE A MASSIVE AND FIGHTS WITH THE MILITARY BUT THESE THESE SMALL INCIDENTS CAN WREAK SO MUCH
FEAR AND TERROR IN COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR DAY TO DAY BUSINESS AND THEN GETTING BLOWN UP THIRTY BODIES AND FIFTY PEOPLE BEING SHOT THAT KIND OF THING IS REALLY WHAT TERRIFIES PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO I WOULD BE LOWEST TO SAY THAT BOOK HER ARMIES ON THE BACK FOOT BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY POPULAR GOVERNMENT LINE TO USE
BUT IS SIGN THOUGH THAT THE BRING BACK A GIRL'S CAMPAIGN MAY FINALLY BE NEARING ITS CONCLUSION CHARLOTTE I OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S TO EIGHT THAT'S ONE OF THE PAPERS MOST OF THEM ARE UNIMPRESSED BY THE QUEEN'S SPEECH IS FAIR TO SAY KEVIN MAGUIRE IN THE MIRROR SAYS RED PUB MENUS WITH MORE DETAIL IN THEM QUENTIN LETTS IN THE MAIL SAYS THIS ONCE GREAT DAY FELT A NUDE AT HER MAJESTY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SUBMITTED HER CONTRIBUTION BY SKYPE FROM WINDSOR CASTLE
SOME CALLS HER SPEECH LIMP THE OFFERING PROOF OF GOVERNMENT IS PARALYSED BY THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE TIMES THEY SAYS IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE LEGISLATION OUTLINED ON PRISONS ON PLANNING AND UNIVERSITIES WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS REFORM AGENDA
IN AN ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO SAYS WORK AND EDUCATION AT THE HEART OF THE PRISON REFORMS HE SAYS A PRISONER'S LIFE COULD BE CHANGED IF HE SPENDS TWENTY TWO HOURS A DAY LOCKED IN A CELL WATCHING TEAM CAN'T BE CHANGE RATHER IF HE SPENDS TWENTY TWO HOURS A DAY LOCKED IN A CELL WATCHING TELEVISION BUT SIMON JENKINS OF THE GUARDED SAYS THE REAL ISSUE WAS SENTENCING BRITNEY'S JAIL CRAZY HE SAYS IS THE COMMUNITY MADE SAFER BY LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR HACKING PHONES ARE RIGGING ENERGY PRICES OR EXPOSING BOTTOMS IN A CATHEDRAL
THE REFORMS WON'T WORK UNLESS PRISON NUMBERS ARE CUT AND SET FOR PAPERS LEAD ON YESTERDAY'S JOB FIGURES THAT SHOW A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THE REST OF THE E.U. WORKING IN THE U.K. THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS THE FIGURES HAVE IGNITED THE BRAKES AT IMMIGRATION DEBATE THE DAILY EXPRESS AS MASS E.U. MIGRATION IS PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WAGES THAT ANY MAIL CALLS THE FIGURES EXPLOSIVE IT SAYS TWO POINT TWO MILLION E.U. MIGRANTS ARE EXPLOITING FREE MOVEMENT RULES THE SUN AS THE HEADLINE BRITS NOT FAIR
OVERALL THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE PAST YEAR SAYS FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THOSE JOBS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K. THE TIME SAYS HER NEW BOOK PUBLISHED TODAY CLAIMS THAT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND WANTED A SENIOR GENERAL COURT MARSHALLED FOR CRITICISING CUTS TO THE ARMED FORCES
THE BOOK IS BY GENERAL SIR RICHARD SHERIFF HERE WERE TO LAUNCH EVENT YESTERDAY TOLD THE PAPER THAT THERE'D BEEN A CUTTING AWAY AT MUSCLE AND DAMN NEARLY BONE IN U.K. DEFENCES THE MALE ALSO AS THE STORY WHITE OR SOURCE TELLS A PAPER THIS GUY'S MADE A SERIES OF OUTLANDISH CLAIMS OVER THE YEARS HE'S TRYING TO SELL A BOOK THE SUN SAYS THAT AFTER THREE YEARS OF TALKS ON THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' CONTRACT WORLD AWARD THREE PICTURES HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SMILING IN AN EDITORIAL PAPER CONGRATULATES HIM FOR ESTABLISHING THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS WILL BE NORMAL WORKING DAY AT THE MIRROR SAYS MY HUNT REMAINS IN THE DARK
HE PURSUED A DEAL EARLIER INSTEAD OF SPREADING PROPAGANDA EIGHT WALKOUT AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POSTPONED OPERATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AND FUNNY THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS THREATENING TO FORCE THE VIDEO STREAMING FIRMS NET FLICKS AN AMAZON TO DEVOTE AT LEAST TWENTY PER CENT OF THEIR CATALOGUES TO EUROPEAN FILMS AND TELEVISION SHOWS HE SAYS HE'S SEEN A DRAFT PROPOSAL TO BE UNVEILED NEXT WEEK DESIGNED TO ENSURE VIEWERS ARE NOT OVERWHELMED BY U.S. IMPORTS THE FIRMS WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTERS WITH FRENCH CINEMA
TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME TO DIP INTO WHAT IMPACT THE E.U. HAS ON OUR DAILY LIVES OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE HAS BEEN TO HASTINGS ON THE SOUTH COAST TO SEE WHAT BRUSSELS HAS DONE FOR OUR BEACHES
JUST A PERFECT DAY
WARM ENOUGH FOR A NICE THOUGH PERHAPS NOT FOR A DAY
IF YOU DID WANT TO AT LEAST YOU'RE BY THE WATER HERE IS
THE OUT IT'S CALM AND IT'S CLEAN THIS IS KEVIN BOORMAN FROM HASTINGS BOROUGH COUNCIL LIFTED ALL MY LIFE MY FAMILY CONNECTION WHICH I'M PROUD OF IS IT MY NAME'S BY THEM MY GREAT UNCLE WAS COX OF THE HASTINGS LIFEBOAT FOR THE DUNKIRK EVACUATION IN NINETEEN FORTY YOU KNOW THIS PLACE WELL AND YOU KNOW ITS WATERS WELL I DO KNOW IT
WHEN I WAS A KEY IF YOU I DON'T THINK WE THOUGHT TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IF IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW I DON'T THINK I'D HAVE BEEN QUITE KEEN TO GO PET IN THE SEASIDE HERE RELATIONS IN THE NINETEENTH
BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES OUR WATERS WERE ABSOLUTELY FILTHY WE WERE PUMPING LARGE VOLUMES OF RAW SEWAGE INTO THE SEA AND SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS DID NOTHING ABOUT IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY BROUGHT IN RULES FORCING ALL ITS MEMBERS TO CLEAN UP THEIR WATERS
WE BATTLED BRUSSELS FOR YEARS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION EVEN STARTED INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE THATCHER GOVERNMENT
AND BY THE NINETEEN NINETIES AS A RESULT OF EUROPEAN INTERVENTION WESTMINSTER WAS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO FORCE THE NEWLY PRIVATISED WATER COMPANIES TO INVEST MORE IN WASTWATER TREE
BRITISH SEASIDE STILL WASN'T CLEAN ENOUGH IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE EUROPEAN UNION MADE THE STANDARDS TWICE AS TOUGH
THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY NOW HEADS OUT EVERY MAY TO SEPTEMBER TO CHECK SITES FOR AT LEAST TWO BACTERIA AND THAT E.U. STIPULATES THE RESULTS HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED SO WE ALL KNOW HOW CLEAN A WATERS OFF OR OTHERWISE
LAST YEAR SAW THE BEST EVER U.K. RESULT
NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR BATHING WATERS PAST AND HASTINGS FINALLY AFTER YEARS OF FAILING WAS ONE OF THEM
WE DID WORK WITH A LOT OF PARTNERS PARTICULARLY SOUTHERN WATER ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS A A PIPE THAT'S NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW WHICH WAS DISCHARGING QUITE AWFUL WATER INTO THE SEA
WE REALISED THAT THE WATER WAS GOING IN WAS REALLY HEAVILY POLLUTED IT CAME THROUGH A LOCAL PARK ALEXANDRA PARK AND ORDINARY THINGS LIKE DOC COOL AND BURP OOH DIDN'T HELP MUCH WORSE THAN THAT THERE WAS WE REALISED THAT SOME HOUSES HAVE BEEN WRONGLY PLUMBED AND THEY WERE DISCHARGING SEWAGE EFFECTIVELY INTO BUNNY STREAMS IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND THESE POMS YOU TO LITERALLY NEED TO DIG DOWN AND THAT IS TIME CONSUMING IT'S VERY EXPOSED
NATIONALLY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY IT'S INVESTED TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS IN THE CLEAN UP OTHERS WATER COMPANIES FARMERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT LANDOWNERS BUSINESSES ALL OF HAD TO PLAY A ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT UNTREATED SEWAGE DOESN'T GET INTO THE WATER SYSTEM
IF WE HADN'T DONE IT AFTER AFTER PIER AT ALL WHO WOULD LITERALLY HAD TO PUT SIGNS UP WARNING PEOPLE THAT TWINKS THE WATER MIGHT BE DANGEROUS IT COULD BE POLLUTED WHO WANTS TO GO TO THE SEASIDE RESORT THAT YOU CAN'T GO INTO THE C. FOUR IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF WE REALLY NEED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION TO PUSH US INTO THIS COULD BE NOT HAVE DONE THIS
I'M SURE WE COULD CERTAINLY I THINK IF YOU'VE GOT A REASON TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL GALVANISE EWING TO IT'S ALL TOO EASY IF THERE WAS PUSHING JUST PUT OFF
IT'S TOMORROW IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE DONE AND I'M REALLY PLEASED THAT WE WERE PUT INTO THIS BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE CLEAN WATERS ARE CLEAN BEACHES THAT WE CAN BE REALLY PROUD
SO BACK TO THE SUNSHINE IF NOT ON A BLUSTERY DAY LIKE THIS FOR THE BATHING EVENTUALLY A BEACH LIKE HASTINGS WE'LL HOPE FOR A BLUE FLAG AWARDS TO REFLECT ITS CLEANLINESS AND FACILITIES
THERE'S NO POINT LOOKING TOWARDS BRUSSELS FOR THAT THE BLUE FLAG SYSTEM IS RUN BY AN N.G.O. BASED ACROSS THE NORTH SEA STINTON
MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND I'VE TUNBRIDGE WELLS STUDIO THIS MORNING'S PROFESSOR ROBERT BECKFORD FROM CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO YOU TODAY IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA IS MALCOLM X. DAY SCHOOLS ANOTHER MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS ARE CLOSED TO HONOUR THEIR NINETEEN SIXTIES CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST
MALCOLM X. IS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE IN AMERICAN HISTORY BECAUSE OF HIS HARSH CRITICISM OF WHITE POWER STRUCTURES SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ONLY BERKELEY WITH ITS HISTORY OF COUNTERCULTURE AND PROGRESSIVE POLITICS RESPECTS MALCOLM X. WITH A DAY OFF WORK
MALCOLM X. IS BEING HONOURED FOR HIS POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT WHAT HE TAUGHT ME IS THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONNECTED ANALYSIS OF SOCIETY IN THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE TO RECOGNISE THE OVERLAP OF ISSUES OF RACE CLASS AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION
IN HIS TIME HE DECONSTRUCTED AMERICAN RACISM AND CLAIMED HER DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BLACKS WAS AS NATURAL TO AMERICA AS EATING APPLE PIE
HIS POLITICAL VOCABULARY EXTENDED BEYOND RACE TALK THOUGH AND HE ALSO CHALLENGED ECONOMIC DISPARITIES ON THE SUBJECT AGENDA MALCOLM AFFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EDUCATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AS RESISTANT TO GENDER INEQUALITY
FOR THOSE EMBARKING ON THIS DAY I THINK THE SALUTATION HAPPY MALCOLM X. DAY IS SOMEWHAT PREMATURE
AFTER ALL HOW CAN YOU CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST CRITICS WHEN THE COUNTRY HE HE'D CHALLENGED IS STILL STRUGGLING TO MAKE GOOD ON FAIRNESS
FOR INSTANCE IN RECENT YEARS THE BLACK LIVES MATTER CAMPAIGN HAS SHONE A LIGHT ON LONG STANDING ISSUES UP IN EQUITY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY AND ON THE MALCOLM'S MEMORY
ACCORDING TO THE FOOD CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIAN JOHANN BAPTIST MET THE PROPER WAY TO REMEMBER REQUIRES US TO CULTIVATE DANGEROUS MEMORIES
DANGEROUS MEMORIES RESULT FROM CRITIQUING THE PAST WHICH LEAD US TO QUESTION THE STORIES THAT OUR SOCIETY TELLS US STORIES THAT SAY THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER FOR ALL OF US STORIES THE TEACHERS THAT THERE IS JUSTICE FOR ALL
DANGEROUS MEMORIES ARE UNSENTIMENTAL WAYS OF REMEMBERING THE PAST THEY REMEMBER THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN BY SOCIETY THE POOR THE EXCLUDED THE SO CALLED WORTHLESS
REMEMBERING THEM AND THE INJUSTICE THEY EXPERIENCED IS DANGEROUS IN THAT WHEN WE ACT POSITIVELY UPON THESE MEMORIES IN THE PRESENT THEY CAN BE A POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION TO THOSE WHO CONTINUED TO PROMOTE INJUSTICE
THEREFORE IN AN IDEAL WORLD MEMORY ALWAYS INVOLVES ACTION IT IN DOING SOMETHING REDEMPTIVE AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU REMEMBER
APPLYING NICKED HIS VIEW OF MEMORY TO THE LIFE OF MALCOLM X. CHANGES THE MEANING OF HIS BIRTHDAY SALUTATION HAPPY MALCOLM X. DAY IS LESS OF A GREETING
BECAUSE IT IS MORE A CALL TO CONTINUE MALCOLM'S QUEST FOR RACE CLASS AND GENDER JUSTICE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH PROFESSOR ROBERT BECKFORD IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT WE ARE FACING A CALAMITY AND WE NEED TO ACT TOGETHER AS A WORLD OF CALAMITY IS TO BE AVOIDED THAT IS THE MESSAGE TODAY FROM LORD O'NEILL GERMANY O'NEILL THE ECONOMIST AND CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REVIEW ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE THE PROBLEM THAT HE SPENT TWO YEARS INVESTIGATING IS INCREASING RESISTANCE OF BUGS AGAINST TRADITIONAL ANTIBIOTICS AND THE FAMILY
NEW ANTIBIOTICS AREN'T COMING THROUGH FAST ENOUGH SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO SAVE MODERN MEDICINE LORD N. IS HERE THE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN WE START ON THE DOCTOR'S SURGERY FOR IT CAN WE BE CLEAR NOW ABOUT WHAT YOUR COMMITTEE'S VIEW IS YOUR RESEARCH
VIEW IS ON HOW DOCTORS SHOULD BE TREATING THAT THE CURRENT PRESCRIBING ABOUND ABOUT
SO THE WHOLE SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MAKING A SORT OF SPLIT INTO THINGS TO BOOST THEIR SUPPLY OF NEW DRUGS AND INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE DEMAND EXCESS OF DEMAND FOR DRUGS RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF IT
HE'S A BIGGER ROLE FOR SO CALLED RAPID DIAGNOSTICS WE LIVE IN AN AGE WHERE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY DOMINATES OUR LIVES AND YET IN THIS SPACE WE STILL BEHAVE AS WE DID
NINETEEN FIFTIES IF NOT EARLIER SO VERY INTERESTING STUDY JUST AS WE WERE
PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES TO A REPORT COME OUT THERE YOU WERE SHOWING THAT ONE IN THREE ANTIBIOTICS THAT'S PRESCRIBED IS NOT NECESSARY WE SIGH EVIDENCE SHOWING IT'S EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SO THAT'S PROSCRIBE BECAUSE THE DOCTOR THAT STAGE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER IT MIGHT WORK ON MIGHT NOT WORK HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED OBVIOUSLY HIGHLY INFORMED EDUCATED GUESS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE
AND IT'S PARTLY TO DO WITH THE PRESSURES THAT WE ALL PUT WE ALL WHAT THINK THIS WEEK'S MIRACLE SWEETS SO FAR AS SAYING THAT THEN IN THAT CASE WE SHOULDN'T PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS UNTIL WE KNOW THAT THEY COULD BE AFFECTED OUR OUR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION IS THAT AND A DEFINED TIME LINE WE WERE ACTUALLY SAYING TWENTY TO N.C. WHO SHOULD BECOME MANDATORY IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
COS IT'S NOT AS BAD PROBABLY IN THE U.K. AS OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IT SHOULD BECOME MANDATORY TO NOT ALLOW ANTIPODES THAT SABI SCREW UP TO BE PRESCRIBED WITHOUT A STATE OF THE ART TO HER BOSS THAT SHOULD WE GO OUR OWN WAY WHETHER OR NOT WE GET AGREEMENT IN TIME WITHOUT THE COUNTRY I THINK ON THIS ONE WE COULD NOT LOSE COS WE COULD SET AN EXAMPLE O.K. THAT'S VERY CLEAR WE COULD DO THE SAME WITH FARMS COULD MAIM AND THERE ARE FARMERS WHO DON'T USE ANTIBIOTICS WITH THEIR ANIMALS WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR I THINK IN FARMING AND AGRICULTURE
IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD AS AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM THAN IN HUMANS HERE EUROPE IS PROBABLY IN A BETTER POSITION THAN MOST OF THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THE U.K. INCLUDED BUT WE STILL HAVE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING TWENTY EIGHT ONWARDS LIMITS
EVERYWHERE ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT HAVE PHASED IN OVER TEN YEARS FOR REDUCING ANTIBIOTICS IN ANIMALS AND AGRICULTURE AND CRUCIALLY WE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT CERTAIN SO CALLED LAST IN LINE ANTIBIOTIC SHOULD BE BANNED COMPLETELY FOR THE USE IN AGRICULTURE COS THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY AND THEY ARE VITAL TO HUMANS AND AGAIN COULD BRITAIN LEAD THE WAY WITH THAT MAKE A GOOD WE GO FAST IN THE REST OF THE WORLD WE COULD BUT IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS CASE THERE
EVERYBODY TRIES THEIR HARDEST TO JOIN UP BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS VERY WORRYING CASE OF COOLEST IN THAT I THINK YOU GIRLS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED BEFORE
UNLESS IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE DENMARK AS BEING ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT TRYING TO TACKLE THIS HEAD ON AND YET THEY'VE HAD SOME CAN LISTON CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF CAR MOVEMENT OF ANIMALS FROM CHINA THAT'S ALL THE DEMAND FOR AND ABOUT INEZ TURN ONTO THE SUPPLY AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PERSUADE COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH A NEW ANTIBIOTICS THAT WE NEED SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS IS THAT YOU GET THEM EITHER TO TAKE PART IN RESEARCH TO PLAY
OR AT LEAST TO PAY FOR RESEARCH THAT THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO DO IT IS IS THAT A SERIOUS OPTION THEY SO IMPORTANTLY AS YOU JUST SAW JUSTIN WE SUSS OUT A WHOLE SERIES OF OPTIONS THAT GOVERNMENTS
SHOULD CONSIDER WHERE WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE G.TWENTY LEADERS NEED TO DECIDE ON I'M AWARE THAT THE BEGINNINGS OF DISCUSSIONS ARE ALREADY TAKING PLACE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE VERY SERIOUSLY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION IS INDEED WHAT WE'RE CALLING YOU EITHER PLAY I TRY TO GET
THE NEW SET OF ANTIBIOTICS THAT ARE NEEDED IN WHICH YOU DIRECTLY GET REMUNERATED FOR COVERING ALL THE COSTS OF IT MAYBE A BIT OF PROFIT BUT THE MONEY COULD COME FROM THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY THAT CHOOSES TO NOT PARTICIPATES BECAUSE
IN SOME WAYS IT'S A BIT OF A CLASSIC FREE RIDE PROBLEM I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT IT EARLIER TODAY IN TERMS OF AN INTERVENTION INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED WHEN YOU WHEN THE MARKET IS FAILING TO DELIVER WHAT OTHERWISE IS NEEDED AND IN THIS CASE NOT ONLY DO WE ALL IN SOCIETY OR SEVEN BILLION IT WAS ALL OVER THE WORLD MADE THEM
BUT THE FARMER INDUSTRY ITSELF ALSO NEEDS THEM FOR SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE DOING THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF THESE WONDERFUL CANCER TREATMENTS WHERE THEY MAKE A LOT AND SHE'S VERY BRIEF IN TWENTY SECONDS ARE SET THEY'D ETON YOU ACCEPT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE FARMER TO SAY COS YOU CAN SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T WORK AND MOST OF THEIR RESEARCH DOESN'T WORK AND IT'S AND ALSO ISN'T GOING TO BE USED IN ANY WAY WE'RE SAYING MARKET ENTRY REWARD WOULD DIRECTLY
GIVE HIM THE MONEY FOR THOSE THAT ARE PREPARED TO DO IT THEY WOULD GET PAID TO DO IT IT'S THE ISSUE IS THE DIFFERENT CHOICES AS TO HOW THAT MONEY IS FOUND AND PUT TOGETHER JIMINY A LOT N. HILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST AND DARREN BETS BACK WITH HER TELL HER DAD HELLO AGAIN WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BAND OF RAIN MOVING IN FROM THE ATLANTIC TODAY BUT AHEAD OF IT SOME WARM SUNSHINE IS DEVELOPING AS WELL SO WE START WITH THE DETAILS ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE EAST MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND NORTH EAST ENGLAND THE LOW CLOUD THAT WE STARTED WITH IS CONTINUING TO BREAK UP THE MOST WILL BE DRY WITH SUNNY SPELLS LIGHT SOUTH WESTERLY BREEZE WARMER THAN YESTERDAY SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN DEGREES

A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNER HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF CONDUCTING VICIOUS AND BRIEFINGS AGAINST THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. DOWNING STREET SAYS IT'S STUCK TO THE ARGUMENTS AND THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU HAS APOLOGISED TO PARLIAMENT AFTER A HEATED DEBATE BECAME RATHER PHYSICAL FOR B.B.C. NEWS READ BY ZEPPELINS
IN EGYPT AIRPLANE FLYING OVERNIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO WHO'S DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR SCREENS IN EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS SAY IT PROBABLY CRASHED EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES SAY THERE WERE SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD INCLUDING ONE BRITISH CITIZEN THE FOREIGN OFFICE SAYS IT'S URGENTLY SEEKING INFORMATION FROM PARIS AND CAIRO IT'S NOW BEING REPORTED THE FLIGHT DID SEND OUT A DISTRESS SIGNAL A MAJOR SEARCH OPERATION IS UNDER WAY HERE'S A CORRESPONDENT CATRIONA RENTON
THE EGYPT HERE FLIGHT LEFT SALVADOR AIRPORT JUST BEFORE TEN PAST ELEVEN YESTERDAY EVENING THE AIRLINE SAID THERE WERE FIFTY SIX PASSENGERS INCLUDING ONE CHILD AND TWO BABIES AS WELL AS TEN CREW ON BOARD FLIGHT M.S. EIGHT FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE PASSENGERS WERE FROM EGYPT FIFTEEN WHERE FRENCH AND THERE WAS ALSO ONE BRITISH CITIZEN
EGYPT DEAR SAID THE AIRBUS A. THREE TWENTY LOST CONTACT WITH RADAR TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE IT WAS SCHEDULED TO LAND IN THE EGYPTIAN CAPITAL AND THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY HE'S NO SAYING IT'S RECEIVED A DISTRESS SIGNAL FROM THE PLANE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST
SEARCH TEAMS HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE LAST RECORDED LOCATION THIRTY TO FORTY MILES NORTH OF EGYPT'S COAST ACCORDING TO ONE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP WHICH WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES SOUTH OF THE GREEK ISLAND OF CARPET HAS REPORTED SEEING A FLAME IN THE SKY
FAMILIES OF THE MISSING PASSENGERS ARE GATHERING IN CAIRO AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LONG IS ALSO HOLDING AN EMERGENCY MEETING WITH HIS MINISTERS
TODD CURTIS RUNS AN AIR SECURITY WEBSITE HE SAID THE PLANE WAS OPERATING WITHIN ITS CAPABILITIES AND WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE GOOD IT WAS A LIGHTLY LOADED AIRCRAFT ARE ROUGHLY FIFTY SIX PASSENGERS AND DRINK RUMOURS I'M GORAN SHE WAS AS FAR LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM GROSS SUPPOSED WEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THEY WERE NO RECORDED THUNDERSTORMS ARE OTHER SEVERE WEATHER OVER THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN AT THE TIME OF THIS OF THE DISAPPEARANCE
AND AVIATION EXPERT SEAN METHODS SAID THE PLANE WAS IN A FLIGHT ZONE WITH A SIGNIFICANT MILITARY PRESENCE IT IS OF COURSE AN AREA WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF COVERAGE FROM ALL SORTS OF REGIONS BECAUSE IT'S SO MILITARILY INVOLVED AROUND THE MIDDLE EAST THERE'LL BE LOTS OF RADARS LOOKING AT THAT AREA MILITARY AND CIVIL AND OF COURSE THERE WILL BE MANY MILITARY FORCES AROUND
A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BREAKS IT CAMPAIGN HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET ARE VICIOUSLY BRIEFING AGAINST TORIES IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. STEVE BAKER THE M.P. WHO CO CHAIRS THE CONSERVATIVES WERE BRITAIN CAMPAIGN GROUP WANT NUMBER TEN'S ACTIONS RISKED LEAVING THE PARTY WITH DEEP DIVISIONS IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
SUCH AS THE FEROCITY OF THE CRITICISM BETWEEN THE RIVAL TORY CAMPS MANY SENIOR CONSERVATIVES FEAR IT COULD PROVE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO REUNITE THE PARTY AFTER THE REFERENDUM TODAY MISTER BAKER IN EFFECT CALLS FOR A TRUCE HOWEVER HIS WORDS MAY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT SINCE HE POINTS THE FINGER OF BLAME SQUARELY AT THE REMAIN SIDE
SITES IN PARTICULAR THE ONSLAUGHT BY LORD HESELTINE ON BORIS JOHNSON THE CLAIM BY SIR JOHN MAJOR THAT BRECHT SAID CAMPAIGNERS WERE MORPHING INTO UKIP AND THE CHANCELLOR'S SUGGESTION THAT HIS OPPONENTS WERE ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE
SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME MY BAKER CALLED FRONT END TO NUMBER TEN'S SCORCHED EARTH POLICY WHAT I ESSENTIALLY I'M SAYING HE'S QUEENSBERRY RULES SO FULL FRONTAL ASSAULT WOULD YOU WARNING IS FINE BUT THE THE DAGGER IN THE HEART INSERTED FROM THE BACK THROUGH WHISPERING IN DARK CORRIDORS IS NOT O.K.
DOWNING STREET HAVE DISMISSED MY BAKER'S CLAIMS AND INSIST THEIR CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ROOTED IN THE ARGUMENTS SOURCES OF ALSO REJECTED SUGGESTIONS THEY PROMPTED LORD HESELTINE TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS AND SAY HE WAS INVITED TO DO SO BY THE B.B.C.
THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS TO BALLET IT'S MEMBERS ABOUT WHETHER TO ACCEPT HER DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS TO END THE DISPUTE OVER A NEW CONTRACT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND DOCTORS HAVE HELD A SERIES OF STRIKES INCLUDING TWO ALL OUT STOPPAGES IN WHICH JUNIOR MEDICS WITHDREW EMERGENCY CARE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAD THREATENED TO IMPOSE THE CONTRACT I HEALTH EDITOR HUGH PYM REPORTS
THERE WILL BE FURTHER SCRUTINY OF THE AGREEMENT OVER THE JUNIOR DOCTOR CONTRACT TODAY INCLUDING IN THE COMMONS WHERE JEREMY HUNT WILL SPELL OUT THE DETAILS TO EM PEAS THERE'S BEEN A SCEPTICAL REACTION AMONG SOME DOCTORS WITH CALLS FOR MORE REASSURANCES OVER WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO EXTEND N.H.S. SERVICES OVER SEVEN DAYS WILL MEAN FOR WORKING HOURS B.M.A. MEMBERS WILL STUDY CAREFULLY THE DEAL AND THE NEW CONTRACT BEFORE VOTING WITH A RESULT IN JULY FAR FROM A FOREGONE CONCLUSION
BUT YESTERDAY'S AGREEMENT WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD WITH BOTH SIDES SEEMINGLY FAR APART JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE B.M.A. EACH ARGUE THEY'VE STRUCK A GOOD DEAL WITH MANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ORIGINAL PROPOSALS NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE DOCTOR'S TO DELIVER THEIR VERDICT
A MAJOR REVIEW OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE SET UP BY DAVID CAMERON HAS WARNED THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY SUPERBUGS COULD KILL ONE PERSON EVERY THREE SECONDS WORLDWIDE UNLESS THERE'S URGENT ACTION THE STUDY SAYS DOCTORS SHOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT TESTS BEFORE PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS TO CHECK WITH THE PATIENTS ACTUALLY NEED THEM HERE'S OUR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT FERGUS WALSH
IN THE TWO YEARS THIS REVIEW HAS TAKEN THE TEAM INVOLVED ESTIMATE AROUND A MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE HAVE DIED FROM DRUG RESISTANT INFECTIONS BUT IT WARNS THAT THIS COULD RISE TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR MORE THAN DIE FROM CANCER UNLESS THE WORLD TACKLES THE SUPERBUG CRISIS
THE REPORT CALLS FOR A GLOBAL PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SO THAT PATIENTS DO NOT DEMAND ANTIBIOTICS WHEN THERE'S NO NEED IT ALSO ONCE A MAJOR REDUCTION IN ANTIBIOTIC USE IN FARM ANIMALS NEW ANTI MICROBIAL AS ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED AND IT SAYS THERE SHOULD BE BIG FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP EFFECTIVE DRUGS
ANTIBIOTICS ARE PERHAPS THE MOST PRECIOUS MEDICINES WE HAVE IF THEY'RE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE IT WILL REQUIRE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION TO CONSERVE THEIR USE AND TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTIONS THAT FUELLED THE RISE OF SUPERBUGS
RESEARCHERS FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SYMPTOMS OF A MINOR STROKE SHOULD TAKE ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY THE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE MEDICAL JOURNAL THE LANCET CONCLUDES THAT THE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF PREVENTING OR LIMITING THE HARM CAUSED BY FURTHER STROKES HAVE BEEN HUGELY UNDERESTIMATED THE LEAD RESEARCHER PROFESSOR PETER ROTHWELL SAYS THE ADVICE FOR DOCTORS AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE CLARIFIED
I THINK FIRST OF ALL WHEN PATIENTS SEE MEDICAL ATTENTION THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN ASPIRIN IMMEDIATELY THE GUIDELINES DO RECOMMEND THAT BUT OFTEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN PATIENTS ARE SENT HOME FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND THEY'RE TOLD TO START TAKING ASPIRIN AT SOME POINT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
AND SO THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE WE NEED TO GIVE PATIENTS ASPIRIN AS SOON AS THEY PRESENT WITH THE T.A. A MINOR STROKE
THE CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUST TUDO HAS APOLOGISED TO PARLIAMENT AFTER AN OPPOSITION M.P. ACCUSED HIM OF ELBOWING IN THE CHEST THERE WERE HEATED EXCHANGES DURING A PROCEDURAL VOTE ON A CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED DYING BILL A CORRESPONDENT DAVID WILLIS REPORTS
THERE WAS UPROAR IN THE NORMALLY STAID CANADIAN PARLIAMENT AS MISTER TRUDEAU STRODE OVER TO A GROUP OF OPPOSITION M.P.S AND THEN SET ABOUT PULLING ONE OF THEM THROUGH THE CROWD AS HE DID SO ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION RUTH ELLEN BRUCE CAN BE SEEN RECOILING IN PAIN VIDEO FOOTAGE THEN SHOWS MY TRUE RETURNING TO HIS SEAT ONLY TO CROSS THE FLOOR AGAIN THIS TIME TO ENGAGE IN AN ANIMATED SHOUTING MATCH WITH ANOTHER M. P.

A SPECIAL SERVICE WILL BE HELD IN LONDON LATER TODAY IN MEMORY OF SIR NICHOLAS WINTON YOU RESCUED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA AFTER THE NAZIS INVADED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE MOST OF THE CHILDREN WERE JEWISH THE FAMILIES DECIDING TO SEND THEM AWAY ON TRAINS ORGANISED BY SIR NICHOLAS WHICH RAN FROM PRAGUE TO LONDON
THEY BECAME KNOWN AS KINDER TRANSPORT SIR NICHOLAS DIED LAST YEAR AGED ONE HUNDRED AND SIX A CORRESPONDENT RICHARD GULPING REPORTS
EVEN NOW SOME OF THOSE RESCUED BY SIR NICHOLAS SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO SAY THEY SEE HIM AS A GODLIKE FIGURE TO WHOM EVERYTHING THEY WERE IN TOTAL EIGHT TRAINS WHICH MANAGED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY TO BRITAIN IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AS A NAZI SEIZE CONTROL OF ALL CZECHOSLOVAKIA
ANOTHER TRAIN FILLED WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CHILDREN WAS STOPPED FROM LEAVING PRAGUE BY THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR TWO ALMOST ALL THOSE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE MURDERED IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS BY THE GERMANS
AMONGST THOSE ATTENDING TODAY'S MEMORIAL SERVICE WILL BE MORE THAN TWENTY OF THOSE WHOSE LIVES WERE SAVED BY THE KINDERTRANSPORT OPERATION
THEY AND THE REST OF THE CONGREGATION WILL CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY AND DECISIVELY TO TRY TO SAVE THOSE BEING TARGETED BY THE NAZIS
RICHARD GALPIN REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT AND EGYPT AIRPLANE FLYING OVERNIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO HAS DISAPPEARED AS WE WERE HEARING THE NEWS FROM RADAR SCREENS IT DID IT IN EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING WITHIN THE LAST HOUR OR SO THAT IT HAS PROBABLY CRASHED
EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES SAY THERE WERE SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD INCLUDING ONE BRITISH CITIZEN L.S. TURN FIRST TO LUCY WILLIAMSON WHO'S THE B. B.B.C.'S PARIS CORRESPONDENT IN THIS ACTOR THE GIRL AIRPORT FROM WHERE THE PLANE TOOK OFF WHAT ARE YOU HEARING YOUR PSYCHE DELICACY
FRANCE IS SLOWLY MOVING INTO ACTION THIS MORNING THERE HAVE BEEN CRISIS CENTRES SET UP AT THE AIRPORT HERE ALSO AT THE FOREIGN MINISTRY PRESIDENTS ON LON HAS SPOKEN TO THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT AND PROMISED HIM CO OPERATION IN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG AND HE'S ALSO EXPECTED TO HOST A CRISIS MEETING AS YOU'D IMAGINE LATER ON TODAY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CABINET BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE FIFTY
FRENCH PASSENGERS ON BOARD THE PLANE AS WELL AS THIRTY EGYPTIANS ONE BRIT YOU MENTIONED AND SEVERAL OTHER NATIONALITIES SO THIS IS VERY MUCH THE PRIORITY I THINK FOR FRANCE AT THE MOMENT BUT OF COURSE THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS BEING RAISED ALREADY ABOUT WHAT CAUSED THIS CRASH AND WHAT POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS THERE MIGHT BE FOR FRANCE AS WELL AS FOR EGYPT AND CONSIDERABLE EARLY INTEREST IN WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS ANY SIGN OF DISTRESS INDEED INDEED ANY CONTACT BETWEEN THE PLANE AND CONTROLLERS BEFORE IT CAME DOWN
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS THE CASE ISN'T IT WITH CRASHES LIKE THIS YOU GET THESE TINY SCRAPS OF INFORMATION AND EVERYONE'S TRYING TO PORE OVER THEM TO WORK OUT WHAT POSSIBLY MIGHT HAVE GONE WRONG WHETHER IT WAS HUMAN ERROR WHETHER IT WAS DELIBERATE BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT A TECHNICAL FAILURE AT THE MOMENT WE KNOW THAT
THEY LOST CONTACT WITH THE PLANE JUST AFTER IT CROSSED INTO EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE THAT WAS ABOUT TWO FORTY FIVE LOCAL TIME THIS MORNING IT WAS VERY VERY CLOSE TO LANDING AT CAIRO AIRPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT TO BEGIN ITS DESCENT AND THAT'S WHEN THEY LOST CONTACT BUT THERE ARE SOME REPORTS
FROM EGYPT AIR IN FACT THAT THERE WAS A DISTRESS SIGNAL GIVEN FROM THE PLANE MUCH LATER
BUT THAT WAS SENT BY THE PLANE'S EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT A PERSON SAID THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENT AUTOMATICALLY M. M. O. K. LUCY WILLIAMSON AT THANK YOU LET'S TALK TO CHRIS PHILLIPS IS FORMER HEAD OF THE NATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM SECURITY OFFICE AND IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THAT DISTINCTION IS PRESUMABLY QUITE AN IMPORTANT ONE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS AN ACTUAL CONSCIOUS DISTRESS CALL OR WHETHER THIS IS JUST SOMETHING AUTOMATIC THERE COMES FROM THE PLAINS EQUIPPED
YEAH VERY MUCH SO AND IF IT IS IN FACT THE PLANE GIVEN OFF THE DISTRESS SIGNAL THAT IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPACTIVE A VERY QUICK AS HAPPENED TO THE PLANE UP IN THE AIR RATHER THAN FOR INSTANCE A HIJACKER TAKEN OVER AND SOMEONE COMMUNICATING WITH THE GROUND
IN TERMS OF SECURITY YOU'D EXPECT THAT SHELVES TO GO WOULD BE AMONG THE MORE SECURE AIRPORTS IN THE WORLD YEAH ABSOLUTELY
USED TO TERRORISM HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH IT A GREAT DEAL RECENTLY AND IN THE AVIATION SECTOR AS WELL BUT BUT OF COURSE PLANES DON'T JUST A START AND END AT ONE AIRPORT THIS AEROPLANE WILL HAVE BEEN FLYING AROUND THE WORLD PROBABLY
AFRICA NORTH AFRICA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET A DEVICE ONTO THE ONTO THE PLANE WHETHER IT BE AN INSIDER AT THE AIRPORT ONE OF THE AIRPORT'S PRIOR TO THAT INTO THE LUGGAGE OR DO THE CARGO THEN IT'S QUITE FEASIBLE THAT
IT'S BEEN DONE SOMEWHERE ELSE IF IT'S CRASHED ON WATER WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE SUGGESTION FROM EGYPT AIR THEN IT WILL BE THE MEDITERRANEAN NOT AS DEEP AS SUMMATIONS AND PRESUMABLY RELATIVELY FEASIBLE TO GET HOLD OF THE BLACK BOX RECORDERS PRETTY QUICKLY
YEAH I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE MILITARY FORCES IN AND AROUND THE AREA I DON'T ALREADY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS PLAY BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IN AN AREA THAT'S BEEN HIGHLY MONITORED IT'S CLOSE TO EFFECTIVELY WAR ZONES AND THERE'S A LOT OF MILITARY ACTION DOWN THERE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY RULE OUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED OTHER THAN THE BOMB ON THE PLANE COULD
SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND THAT'S COME UP TO HIT IT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE THAT BUT BUT I THINK FOR SURE THE WE WILL KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS WITHIN THE NEXT SIX HOURS AND WE DON'T ALSO KNOW THAT IT ISN'T JUST SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAS HAPPENED TO THE PLANE IN THE WAY TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS DO HAPPEN
YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE THING IS THESE PLANES ARE SO RELIABLE THESE DAYS THEY'RE VERY RARELY DO THEY MALFUNCTIONS THAT WOULDN'T AT LEAST INFORM THE GRANT AND CERTAINLY THE PILOT'S DEN WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT IT'S SO DRAMATIC IT'S SO QUICK AND THAT POINTS REALLY TOWARDS SOME KIND OF AN EXPLOSION
CHRIS PHILLIPS FORMER HEAD OF THE NATIONAL COUNTER TERRORISM SECURITY OFFICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST EIGHT IT'S TAKEN FOUR YEARS EIGHT DAYS OF STRIKES THIS YEAR AND THE MOST RECENTLY EIGHT DAYS OF INTENSE TALKS BUT LAST NIGHT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAY THEY STRUCK A DEAL THAT SHOULD MEAN NO MORE STRIKES BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND
IT WILL NEED TO BE APPROVED IN A VOTE OF ALL THE UNION'S MEMBERS BUT IT HAS THE SUPPORT OF DOCTORS' LEADERS AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SAID IT PROVIDED THE IMPORTANT CHANGES NECESSARY TO DELIVER A SAFER SEVEN DAY N.H.S. WHEN HE JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SARAH SO DID YOU WIN
I DON'T THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO TALK ABOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS THE GOVERNMENT SECURED OUR IMPORTANT RED LINES FOR DELIVERING A SAFE A SEVEN DAY SERVICE THIS DEAL BRINGS DOWN THE COST OF EMPLOYING EXTRA DOCTORS AT THE WEEKEND BY ABOUT A THIRD FOR HOSPITALS WHICH WILL REALLY HELP THEM TOO
MORE DOCTORS AT WEEKENDS IF THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I THINK IS ALSO VERY GOOD FOR DOCTORS THEY'RE SAYING THEIR BASIC PAY GO UP BY BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN PERCENT OR SEEN THE MAXIMUM HOURS THEY CAN BE ASKED TO WORK IN ANY WEEK WALK DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THE NUMBER OF NIGHTS THEY CAN ASK TO BE ASKED TO WORK IN A ROW
BROUGHT DOWN AND SOME REALLY IMPORTANT REFORMS FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE TIME OFF FOR MATERNITY FOR EXAMPLE SO I I THINK IT IS A WIN WIN AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD BASIS FOR GOING FORWARD FOR THE N.H.S. SAFER HIGHER QUALITY CARE FOR PATIENTS BUT ALSO BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS FOR DOCTORS BUT THIS LOT'S UP FOR THOSE OF US ON THE OUTSIDE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT HAS CHANGED AND THEREFORE WHY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS I ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I WONDERED WHAT CONCESSIONS DID YOU MAKE IN THE END IF YOU ASK
RUSSELL WHAT CONCESSIONS DID WE MAKE WE MADE I THINK SOME IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE POSTED ON A SIX MONTH ROTATION TO LEEDS AND YOUR PARTNER IS BASED IN LONDON THAT'S VERY DISRUPTIVE FOR FAMILY LIFE AND WE HAVE SAID THAT HEALTH EDUCATION ENGLAND THAT DECIDES THESE POSTINGS WILL NOW HAVE A DUTY TO CONSIDER FAMILY LIFE ISSUES WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHERE PEOPLE ARE POSTED
IF YOU TAKE TIME OFF FOR MATERNITY LEAVE WE'VE INTRODUCED WHAT I THINK IS A VERY INNOVATIVE PACKAGE WHICH COULD BECOME A MODEL FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE N.H.S. WHERE WE'LL ALLOW DOCTORS WHO MIGHT TAKE SIX MONTHS OFF TO HAVE A BABY TO CATCH UP BY DOING EXTRA CLASSES EXTRA TRAINING WHEN THEY COME BACK TO WORK SO THEY CAN GET BACK TO THE POSITION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THEIR TRAINING IF THEY HADN'T HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF HER MATERNITY LEAVE SO THERE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS BUT I THINK WHAT CHANGED
WAS THE BRAVE DECISION BY THE LEADER OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS COMMITTEE OF THE B.M.A. TO HAVE SENSIBLE PROPER NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT WEEKEND PREMIUM PAY THAT SOMETHING THAT THE B.M.A. HAD NOT BEEN WILLING TO DO
FOR THREE YEARS AND THAT WAS REALLY THE CAUSE OF THE TALKS BREAKING DOWN IN FEBRUARY AND HE TOOK THAT WHAT I RECOGNISE AS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS ON THAT AND ONCE HE'D DONE THAT I THINK WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE LOTS OF OTHER ISSUES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OUT VERY QUICKLY YOU SAID IN FEBRUARY THAT SOME ELEMENTS OF THE B.M.A. AIR USING THE STRIKES AS A POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO BASH A TORY GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HATE
IS THAT NO LONGER THE CASE WELL I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN A VERY SERIOUS POSITIVE THING THE DESTRUCTIVE ATTITUDE FROM THE LEADER OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS COMMITTEE JOHANN MARIJUANA AND IN IF THAT WAS THE CASE I THINK HE'S SHOWN THAT THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT WHAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE B.M.A. STAND FOR THEY CLEARLY DO YOU WANT TO DO A DEAL THAT IS THE RIGHT THING FOR PATIENTS IN THE RIGHT THING FOR DOCTORS BUT IT'S IT'S YOU SPOT
BASICALLY NOW TO GET THIS VOTE PAST OR MEMBERS OF THE B.M.A. AND AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE SAID ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENT WHERE GOVERNMENT MOVED HAS MOVED IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY WERE BEING OFFERED BEFORE
WELL I THINK THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WILL IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS AND I THINK
YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL GOT LESSONS TO LEARN FROM WHAT HAS BEEN AT TIMES AND INCREDIBLY BITTER PROTRACTED DISPUTE BUT CERTAINLY THE ONE THING THAT I HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THAT IT'S BEEN SO ACRIMONIOUS AND BEEN SO PROLONGED I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO THROUGH
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THE LAST TEN MONTHS AND SAY THAT EVERYONE HASN'T GOT LESSON TO LEARN INCLUDING THE HEALTH SECRETARY BUT WHAT I'VE CERTAINLY SO YOU WILL YOU WILL SAY TO MEMBERS TO JUNIOR DOCTORS LOOK I PUT MY HANDS UP I WAS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S GOT SO MESSY BUT I DON'T SO I'M THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND OPERATIONS DELAYED I DON'T SAY I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WAS A DECISION TAKEN BY THE B.M.A. AND ESSENTIALLY CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT AT THAT TIME
THERE WAS NO WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE ON THE BIG ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE TO DELIVER A SEVEN DAY N.H.S. BUT WHAT I DO SAY IS THAT I THINK WE HAVE COME TO APPRECIATE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF ANGER A LOT OF FRUSTRATION FELT BY JUNIOR DOCTORS ABOUT THINGS THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND THEIR CONTRACT ABOUT SOME OF THE INFLEXIBILITY IS IN THEIR TRAINING ABOUT THE CONTINUITY OF TRAINING THE FACT THAT THEY FEEL THAT IT CHOPS AND CHANGES A LOT ABOUT THE INFLEXIBILITY IS A MOVING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES
AND THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WE DO WANTS TO ADDRESS CONSTRUCTIVELY AND POSITIVELY I THINGS THAT WE HAVE
STARTED TO TRY AND DEAL WITH IN YESTERDAY'S AGREEMENT BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM CONSTRUCTIVE POSITIVELY AS WELL THIS IS A RECOGNITION THAT YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO TO
IMPROVE THEIR MORALE AMONG JUNIOR DOCTORS WHICH IS CLEARLY SHOT NOT LEAST GIVEN THE MOST RECENT PRICE
I THINK WHAT THE RECENT PROCESS HAS IT UNCOVERED IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FRUSTRATIONS AND BUGBEARS I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL THAT WE SHOULD DO ANYWAY AND NOT JUST FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS I THINK SOME OF THE ROSTERING
HE'S VERY INFLEXIBLE IF PEOPLE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT A PARENT OR A GRANDPARENT WITH DEMENTIA AND THEY HAVE CARING RESPONSIBILITIES OR IF THEY HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEY WANT TO WORK LESS IN SCHOOL HOLIDAYS THEN WE DO NEED TO HAVE A ROSTERING SYSTEM THAT'S FLEXIBLE OR RECOGNISES THOSE FAMILY COMMITMENTS BUT BY THE SAME MERIT WE ALSO NEED TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH DOCTORS TO MAKE CARE FOR PATIENTS SAFER AT WEEKENDS THAT WAS A
BIG COMMITMENT ABOUT THE N.H.S. ARE SAFER SEVEN DAY N.H.S. ON THE FIRST PAGE OF OUR MANIFESTO AND IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO DELIVER THAT AND ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT DO DELIVER THE SAFEST BEST CARE ACROSS ALL SEVEN DAYS
THOSE ARE ALSO THE PLACES WHERE THE MORALE AMONGST DOCTORS IS HIGHEST SO I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A WIN WIN I WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE QUEEN'S SPEECH YESTERDAY'S QUEEN SPEECH WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT WANTS TO DO WITH ITS TIME IN GOVERNMENT HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO YOUR COLLEAGUE IAN DUNCAN SMITH WHO SAID THAT MANY CONSERVATIVES BECOME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S HELTER SKELTER PURSUIT OF THE REFERENDUM THEY JET ACING JETTISONING OR WATERING DOWN KEY ELEMENTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME
I DON'T AGREE WITH IT ALTHOUGH I HAVE HUGE RESPECT FOR THE REFORMS THAT HE PUSHED THROUGH WHEN HE WAS WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY BUT I THINK IF YOU JUST LOOK AT TWO AREAS OF REFORM THAT WERE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH CASES THE BIGGEST REFORMS TO THEIR SECTORS IN OUR LIFETIMES
CHANGES TO THE PRISON SECTOR AND THE CHANGES TO THE UNIVERSITY SECTOR THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT IS REALLY COMMITTED TO BIG REFORMS AND THEY'RE NOT JUST WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK THEIR BUSINESS HARD LOOK ELSEWHERE IT'S A BIT THIN NO THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ON TOP OF THE ENORMOUS REFORMS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY AND THOSE CARRY ON WITH THE DIGITAL ECONOMY BILL WHICH IS GOING TO IMPROVE BROADBAND COVERAGE THE BILLS THAT WILL IMPROVE HOUSING PROVISION AND TRANSPORT PROVISION
THEY AREN'T JUST REFORMS FOR REFORM SAKE THESE ARE REFORMS WITH A PURPOSE THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT BELIEVES IN GIVING EVERYONE A SECOND CHANCE NO MATTER HOW TOUGH AND CHALLENGING THEIR UPBRINGING MAY HAVE BEEN THAT'S VERY MUCH PART OF OUR VISION AND THAT APPLIES TO PRISONERS
THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AFTER CHILDREN IN CARE INCREASED RATES OF ADOPTION AND PROVE THE QUITE EDUCATE EVERYBODY DID ALL THE CONTENTS OF THE OF THE QUEEN'S SPEECH YESTERDAY BUT ON THAT SAID ONE OF THE THE ARGUMENTS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS MAKING US THE PADRE'S ADJUSTING IT'S BECAUSE OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WE'VE HAD STEVEN BAKER ANOTHER OF YOUR COLLEAGUE THIS MORNING SAYING ITALY DOWN IT'S GOT TWO NASTY WITH ITS CAMPAIGNS DOES HE HAVE A POINT
I DON'T THINK HE DOES AND THE I STEVE ENORMOUSLY FOR THE INTEGRITY OF HIS POSITION EVEN IF I DON'T AGREE WITH IT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS A CAMPAIGN THIS IS A VERY VERY BIG DECISION THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE AND
INEVITABLY BOTH SIDES MAKE THEIR CASES ARE STRONGLY AS THEY CAN AND I THINK ANYONE LOOKING AT THE SUBJECTIVELY WOULD SAY THAT THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FORCEFULLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT IS THAT IN THE END IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT STEVE THINKS OR WHAT I THINK SO WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER THINKS IT'S THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR SAY JENNY FIRST TIME IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS JEREMY HUNT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR A LITTLE SPORT AND ALISON'S HERE JUSTIN THANK YOU GOOD MORNING LIVERPOOL MANAGER YAKKING CLOP HAS DECIDED TO USE THEIR EUROPA LEAGUE FINAL DEFEATS AND BE STRONGER NEXT SEASON WITHOUT EUROPEAN FOOTBALL LIVERPOOL LOST THREE ONE TO CHAMPION SEVERE
ENGLAND FAST BOWLER STUART BROAD BELIEVES THE TEAM CAN RETURN TO NUMBER ONE IN THE TEST RANKINGS IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED THAT THE SERIES AGAINST SRI LANKA WHICH STARTS TODAY WILL BE PLAYED AS A SUPER SERIES WITH POINTS AWARDED ACROSS ALL THREE FORMATS BROUGHT HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO ME AHEAD OF THE FIRST INVESTOR TEST AT HEADINGLEY A VENUE WHICH HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND
WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT RECORD AT HEADINGLEY AND I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK I'VE BOUGHT TICKLEY WHAT I HAD IN ME SO THAT'S A REAL BIG CHALLENGE FOR ME THIS WEEK IS TO SETTLE INTO THE SERIES QUICKLY GET USED TO THE CONDITIONS AT HEADINGLEY QUICKER THAN I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST TO TRY AND EXPOSE ANY MOVEMENT THAT MIGHT BE DOWN THERE WITH YOU YOU COME INTO THIS HEADINGLEY TEST MATCH THERE IS THE NUMBER ONE RANKED TEST BOWLER IN THE WORLD
WILL THERE BE ADDED EXPECTATION ON YOU WITH THAT LABEL I DON'T THINK I THINK EVERY TIME YOU STEP ON THE FIELD IN AN ENGLAND SHIRT THERE'S A LOT OF EXPECTATION AND I ALWAYS EXPECT A LOT FROM MYSELF I DON'T THINK I'VE PERFORMED
THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AT HEADINGLEY THAT TEND TO GO FOR TWOMBLY RUNS SIMPLY BUT IT'S EXCITING BEING ON ONE OF THE WORLD IT'S TEN DOESN'T MEAN I'M BETTER THAN ABOUT STAIN OR JIMMY OR ANYTHING IT JUST MEANS THAT I'VE BEEN FIT I'VE BEEN TAKING WICKETS IMPORTANT WICKETS THE GREAT THING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SPORT IS THAT IT KEEPS CHALLENGE PRETTY MUCH EVERY MINUTE THE DAY I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH SUMMER A REAL COMPETITIVE SOMEONE ON THE FIELD BUT I'M THE SORT OF GUY THAT THRIVES OFF COMPETITIVE NATURE AS WELL WHEN YOU GET THE CHOICE OF
NO NO I'M GOING TO COVER THE CHOICES ENDS IN NINE YEARS OF BOWLING AT THEM FROM JIMMY BUT BECAUSE JIMMY SWINGS THE BALL AWAY HE LOOKS TO TRY AND GET THE WIND GOING SLIGHTLY ACROSS BUT IMAGINE IT DOWN THE HEAD AT HEADINGLEY SO I'M SURE I'LL BE CHUCKING UP THAT HILL IF YOU DO GET THE CHANCE TO BOWL OVER HE'LL TRY AND MAKE USE OF IT YOU'RE THE NUMBER ONE RANKED BOWLER IS THERE EIGHTEEN AT GOAL TO RETURNED TO NUMBER ONE IN THE TEST RANKINGS THAT WAS A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN AND ANDY FLOWER IF THEIR SPECIFIC
HALFWAY TO GET THE TEAM BACK TO NUMBER ONE AND WHICH OTHER BAILIFF THERE IS CERTAINLY A HUGE AIM OF THE TEAM YOU'RE RIGHT WITHOUT THE FLOWER WAS A VERY STRATEGIC WE HAVE TO WIN THIS SERIES BY THIS THEN WE GO ONTO THIS SERIES WE'D BUY THAT AND I THINK WITH THE PLAYERS WE HAD IN THAT TEAM THAT REALLY WORLD WITH THIS TEAM THAT WOULDN'T WORK SO MUCH IT'S A BIT MORE FREE SPIRITED IT'S A BIT MORE PLAY THE DAY BY EAR ALMOST
THE BIGGEST THING THAT THE TEAM TALK ABOUT THE CHANGING ROOM IS ENTERTAINMENT ACTUALLY SO THAT'S THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE IN THE CHANGING AT THE MOMENT YOU NOTICED LAST YEAR WHEN WE THIRTY FOUR LORDS ROUTINE STOKE CITY BUT EVERYWHERE AND ENTERTAIN THE CROWD I THINK THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO GO ABOUT THINGS AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT THE TALENT TO CHANGE AND IF WE DO ENTERTAIN IF WE DO PLAY IN AN EXCITING MANNER WE WILL GET TO NUMBER ONE EVENT
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BE ENTERTAINED BY HIS ALISTAIR COOKE IS NEARING TEN THOUSAND TEST RUNS WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THE CAPTAIN AND THE WAY YOU'VE GOT ABOUT HIS CAREER TO ACCUMULATE THAT REALLY
IT'S AMAZING HE'S THE EXAMPLE TO EVERYONE NOT JUST PEOPLE PLAYING AT THE TOP LEVEL BUT YOUNGSTERS AS WELL COS HE HAS HAD TOUGH TIMES HE'S GOT THROUGH THOSE TOUGH TIMES I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE I'VE PLAYED IN A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THE TEST MATCHES WORRY SCORED ALL THOSE RUNS AND HE'S A GUY THERE WILL ALWAYS FIGHTS THE END THEY ALWAYS VERY PROUD TO REPRESENT ENGLAND HE'S DONE IT WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE AND WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF SKILL AND VERY PROUD TO

A LEADING CONSERVATIVE BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGN HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF BRIEFING AGAINST TORIES IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION SUE BAKER SAID THE REFERENDUM DEBATE HAD DESCENDED INTO INSULTS PERSONAL ATTACKS AND PETTY TABLOID SMEARS NUMBER TEN INSISTED CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ROOTED IN THE ARGUMENTS
THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS AN AGREEMENT REACHED WITH GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATORS OVER NEW CONTRACTS FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND IS THE BEST AND FINAL WAY TO END THE ROW THE DOCTORS' UNION WILL NOW POLE ITS MEMBERS ON THE DEAL THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT TOLD US THE GOVERNMENT MADE IT IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS BUT SECURED ITS RED LINES FOR DELIVERING A SAFE A SEVEN DAY SERVICE
A MAJOR REVIEW OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE HAS WARNED THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY SUPERBUGS COULD KILL ONE PERSON EVERY THREE SECONDS WORLDWIDE UNLESS THERE'S URGENT ACTION THE STUDY SAYS DOCTORS SHOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT TESTS BEFORE PRESCRIBING ANTIBIOTICS TO CHECK WHETHER PATIENTS ACTUALLY NEED THEM
THANK YOU TIS JUST EXACTLY HALF PAST EIGHT A FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK JUMPS INTO THE BRAKES AT DEBATE THIS MORNING HE'S TOLD THE TIMES THAT HE'S NOT TELLING US HOW TO VOTE BUT HE'S MAKING IT VERY CLEAR AS WELL THAT HE'S HOPING WE REMAIN IN THE E.U. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG SPEAKS AS A POLITICIAN BUT ALSO OF COURSE AS A BUSINESSMAN WHO EMPLOYS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND HE SAYS SO HE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE SOME OF THOSE OPERATIONS ACROSS THE CHANNEL IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE MY BLOOMBERG IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND YOU THINK THE ECONOMIC
THE CONSEQUENCES OF US LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO DO THAT WOULD BE DONE
I DON'T KNOW DI IS THE RIGHT WORD I JUST THINK THAT OF THE U.K. WOULD BE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THE SITUATION THEY HAVE NOW THEY HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF THE E.U. THEY HAVE THE BORDERS THAT THEY CAN CONTROL UNLIKE THE REST OF THE E.U. THEY HAVE A TRADE THAT SUPPLY US WITH THE REST OF THE E.U. THEY HAD SOME ABILITIES TO INFLUENCE THE DIALOGUE THAT WITHOUT WHICH THEY WOULD AND AMERICA WHICH IS MY CONCERN WOULD NOT BENEFIT
HAVE YOU GIVEN THE GAME AWAY WITH THE LAST SENTENCE THERE AMERICA IS YOUR CONCERN WELL I'M I'M NOT I MIGHT BUT FOR THOSE WHO JOE IF I JUST ASK TO THOSE WHO REPRESENT AMERICA AND ALSO REPRESENT VERY VERY BIG BUSINESS YOU'RE SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN WHICH IS IN AMERICA ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN THE WORLD THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH YES OF COURSE IT WOULD SUIT YOU AND YOUR PURSUIT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SUIT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS JUST TOTALLY NOT FAIR
I HAVE SOME CREDENTIALS HERE AND MY DAUGHTERS HAVE BRITISH PASSPORTS THANKS TO THEIR BRITISH MOTHER AYE WE DID RECEIVE AN HONORARY KNIGHT OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE FROM HER MAJESTY I ALSO HAVE RECEIVED THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY OF LONDON AWARD WHICH I CAN MEANS I CAN DRIVE CATTLE AND SHEEP OVER LONDON BRIDGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU INTEND IT WAS BOTH BORIS AND DAVID CAMERON AS THE SHOWED ME I WAS IN THE RAT A WHAT HAPPENS WITH RECKLESS I'LL STILL HAVE THAT SERIOUSLY IT'S NOT FOR ME TO TELL
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAD A VOTE IT IS FOR ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT AS AN EMPLOYER OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. SOMEBODY WHO HAS A RESIDENCE HERE AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS BUILDING TWO OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUILDINGS I THINK EVER BUILT HERE IN THE U.K. IN LONDON TO MAKE THIS A EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR COMPANY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR AMERICA WITHIN THEM THAT HAS TO GO INTO THE THINKING OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT FOR THEMSELVES AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP AS AN AMERICAN ARE YOU NOT IMPRESSED AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT BY THE ARGUMENT FROM THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AS THAT THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM YOU TALKED ABOUT OUR BORDER AND A CONTROL HAVE A BORDER THEY WOULD SAY WE DON'T CONTROL OUR BORDER BECAUSE FOREIGNERS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO COME INTO THIS COUNTRY AMERICA WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH THAT
THEY SAY SIMILARLY WE DON'T CONTROL OUR LAWS BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT LAWS ARE MADE IN BRUSSELS AMERICA WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH THAT AND IT WOULDN'T WORK THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE WE ALL LIVE IN AN INTERNATIONAL WORLD WE ALL HAVE AGREEMENTS AMERICA'S LAWS ARE MADE FOR UNITED STATES AMERICAN LAWYERS IT'S NONE OF SYED ALI LOVELY FINISH AS A MAID IN THE EEL BRITISH LAWS ARE MADE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WE HAVE ALL OF WHAT I WAS TOLD FROM YOU WANT TO TALK HE WON'T KNOW I'M JUST O.K. PRESSING ON THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME A CHANCE TO RESPIRE THAN PRESSING ME
WE HELP WE LIVE IN AN INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL WORLD IT'S VERY BIG PART OF THE U.K.'S ACADEMY IS BASED ON EXPORTS TO THE E.U. AND TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO THEY CERTAINLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE HEALTH OF THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES AND OF THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVING A RESPECT FOR THE U.K. THAT'S WHAT CREATES JOBS HERE IN THE U.K. IT IS IT'S WHAT THE TRADE BALANCES ARE DRAMATICALLY WADED IN FAVOUR OF THE U.K.
IN DEALING WITH THE E.U. AND IF THEY WERE TO DROP OUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE HOW THEY COULD EVER NEGOTIATED A TRADE DEAL WITH THE EEL THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE NOW AFTER ALL THE E.U. WOULD HAVE EVERY INTEREST TO NOT GIVE THEM THOSE THAT NOBODY ELSE WOULD DROP OUT OF THE E.U. BUT IN RETURN FOR THAT WE ARE ASKED TO TRADE SOME OF OUR FREEDOM AND I PUT IT TO YOU AGAIN IN A MANNER THAT AMERICANS WOULD NOT ALLOW
THAT'S NOT FAIR WE YOU'VE TRADE THAT YOU YOU MAKE AGREEMENTS TO DO THINGS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO AGREED TO DO IN THE INTEREST OF MUTUAL CO OPERATION DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T GO ON DO SOMETHING INDEPENDENTLY NO YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS INDEPENDENTLY BUT YOU HAVE TO YOU WILLING TO DO THINGS JOINTLY AS WELL
SHOULD YOU BE HERE AT THIS TIME OF CRISIS IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY POLITICAL CRISIS A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE HOPING YOU WERE GONNA RUN DISTRESSED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP DISTRESSED ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON TOO PRETTY UNPOPULAR CANDIDATE YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT RUNNING THIS I AM NOT RUNNING FOR A PRESENT STATE I KNOW
BECAUSE A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE NORRIS SYSTEM HAS NO CHANCE OF WINNING AND IF YOU HAD A CHANCE OF WINNING I WOULD'VE RUN BUT I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE OF DOING THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR AID TO CANDIDATE RACE BECAUSE IF NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY OF ELECTORAL VOTES AND THEN IT GOES TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY WOULD PICK ONE OF WHICHEVER PARTY VERY IN AT THE TIME
WILL PECK THAT CANDIDATES OF THE INDEPENDENT JUST HAS NO CHEST SO HE YOU WOULD HAVE FEARED THEN IF YOU'D RUN THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE PICKED DONALD TRUMP THAT HE MIGHT HAVE GOT IN THAT ACTUALLY YOU'RE RUNNING MIGHT HAVE MADE IT MORE LIKELY THAT HE'D BE ELECTED I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SENT IT TO THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE WOULD VOTE SOMETHING THAT THEY CONTINUE TO KEEP THE HOUSE AFTER THE NEXT ELECTION WHICH THE PILE SO WELL THAT THEY WOULD VOTE THE REPUBLIC HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE ABOUT DUNCAN
I'M WORRIED YOU PEEP NUMBER ONE PEOPLE SAY THINGS DURING CAMPAIGNS WHICH LATER ON HAVE NOTHING TO DO THE WAY THEY'RE GOVERNED SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING NUMBER TWO YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT EVERYBODY THAT RUNS AND TRIED TO SEE IF THEY TRY TO SUPPORT PARTICULARLY IF IT'S IN YOUR COUNTRY SUPPORT THE CANDIDATES THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU WHEN YOUR FAMILY YOU WERE NEVER GOING TO AGREE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WITH ANY CANDIDATE
BUT YOU STILL YOU STILL CAN HAVE A PREFERENCE I HAVE A PREFERENCE AND I WOULDN'T PERHAPS DOWN THE ROAD THAT EXPRESS THEIR PUBLICLY I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO EXPRESS THEIR PREFERENCE ON THE VOTING BOTH BUT WHAT SOME PEOPLE AND YOU WANT TO SPEND MY DO YOU INCLUDE THEM LOT ARE PROMINENT REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THAT THIS ISN'T ANY ORDINARY CANDIDATE THIS IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT THIS IS A MAN WHO'S TAKEN A POLITICAL PARTY HOSTAGE FOR HIS OWN
AMES THE FRIEND COULD DO ENORMOUS DAMAGE DO YOU DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IT IS AS SERIOUS AS THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR STATEMENT IS TRUE HE IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL CANDIDATE NOBODY PREDICTED THAT SOMEBODY EXPOSING THE VIEWS THAT HE HAS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE BELIEVES THE ROLE CHANGE THEM BUT WHAT HE SAID BEFORE NOBODY
NO POLITICAL EXPERT WOULD HAVE SAID SOMEBODY SAYING THOSE THINGS BEHAVING THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE A CHANCE AND YET THERE HE IS BUT THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT AND THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS BRIT WANTS SOMETHING THEN WINSTON CHURCHILL IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD SYSTEM BUT IT'S BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHERS MICHAEL DREAM BACK NICE TO TALK TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU HAVEN'T YOU
IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THE PRIME MINISTER SET OUT PLANS TO REFORM SCHOOLS PRISONS AND ADOPTION SERVICES IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH YESTERDAY A PROGRAMME THAT HE SAID THAT COMBINES ECONOMIC SECURITY WITH EXTENDING LIFE CHANCES FOR ALL FROM A PROGRESSIVE ONE NATION CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WELL JEREMY CORBIN JOKE THAT ON CURRENT FORM MUCH OF WHAT HER MAJESTY ANNOUNCED WILL NOT REQUIRE HER SIGNATURE
SO WHAT WILL LABOUR A POSE OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT TRIES TO DO IN THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR AHEAD WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY OWEN SMITH LABOUR M.P. FOR POINTY PRUDENT SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WORK AND PENSIONS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT WILL YOU BE OPPOSING OF WHAT YOU HEARD YESTERDAY
LOTS OF WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AND IMAGINE WE WILL SUPPORT WHAT I THINK WE WOULD BE IN FAVOUR OF BETTER MEANS OF GETTING ADOPTION WORKING THIS COUNTRY I THINK IF THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A CARAMELISATION ONLY BEING SOMETHING IS LABOUR ENVISAGE IT WORKING IN AREAS WHERE SCHOOLS AREN'T PERFORMING WELL THEN WE'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT TOO I THINK
POSSIBLY SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THEY PUT IN PLACE ABOUT OR THEY SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE AROUND PRISON REFORM COULD BE SOMETHING WE SUPPORT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MEAT TO EAT THE REALITY IT WAS A PRETTY FLABBY PRETTY THIN QUEEN'S SPEECH I THOUGHT THE QUEEN LOOKED A BIT BORED READING IT OUT HERSELF I SUSPECT SHE WAS WONDERING WHERE THE BEEF WAS WE WERE CERTAINLY WONDERING WHERE THE BEEF WAS ESPECIALLY
THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE DONE A LOT IN THIS QUEEN'S SPEECH THEY COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SUBSTANTIVE BILLS THEY BROUGHT FORWARD AND WE KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE GOT PROBLEMS IN THE TORY PARTY ABOUT THE REFERENDUM AND THEREFORE THEY DECIDED TO SOFT PEDAL IN THIS QUEEN'S SPEECH DOES MAKE ME WORRY A BIT ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE GOT
STORED UP FOR US AFTER THE REFERENDUM THAT THEY FELT THEY COULDN'T BRING FORWARD SOME OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE CONTROVERSIAL FOR THEIR BACKBENCHERS THIS SIDE OF THE REFERENDUM THAT DOES GIVE ME CAUSE FOR CONCERN NUMBER TEN SAID THEY WERE TWENTY ONE BUILT FROM THAT COMPARES WITH AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTEEN OVER THE LAST DECADE AND THEY SAY IT'S A BOLD AND RADICAL AGENDA YEAH WELL THEY WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T THEY BUT THEY'VE GOT THEY WERE THEY WERE THERE WAS A SPACE PORT BILL IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH YESTERDAY THEY WERE MINOR TINKERING THEY WERE FOR BILLS AT THEY'VE ANNOUNCED BEFORE THERE WAS A COUNTER EXTREMISM BILL AT THE IMMENSE LAST YEAR
IT WAS ANOTHER RISIBLE ATTEMPT TO REBRAND THE TORY PARTY THEY'VE BEEN THE PARTY OF WORK WORKERS LAST YOU KNOW THEY DESCRIBING THEMSELVES TO THE PARTY MOST ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE CHANCES ARE DISABLED AND DISADVANTAGE WELL YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT SHORT SHRIFT I THINK THE COUNTRY WILL GIVE SHORT SHRIFT TO YOU ACCUSING THEM OF TREADING WATER BUT COULDN'T LABOUR BE ACCUSED OF DOING THE SAME THING
NOT REALLY WE'RE NOT IN GOVERNMENT ARE WE SARAH IF THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU COULD BE PUSHING FOR OR DOING AN ARGUABLY ON ARE NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEBATE BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT AT ALL AND I THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR YESTERDAY THAT WE NEEDED FOR EXAMPLE A BIG ECONOMIC BILL WE'VE GOT LOTS OF GREAT RHETORIC FROM THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT REBALANCING THE ECONOMY ABOUT
GETTING RID OF THE REGIONAL INEQUALITIES IN OUR COUNTRY BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE STEEL INDUSTRY IS IN CRISIS IN SOUTH WALES AND MUCH OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WHEN AMERICA IS INTRODUCING YESTERDAY TARIFFS HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PER CENT ON CHINESE IMPORTED STEEL NOT A MENTION OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN WHITE SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE PUT FORWARD ON I THINK WE WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY PUT FORWARD A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH THE STEEL INDUSTRY I THINK IN WHAT WAY THAT
WELL WE KNOW THEY NEED HELP IN TERMS OF ENERGY COS WE KNOW THEY NEED HELP IN TOMBS ALL THE DUMPING IN PARTICULAR WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN EUROPE TWO THREE YEARS AGO ARGUING FOR REFORM OF THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO INTRODUCE GREATER TARIFFS ON CHINESE STEEL BUT THE VERY LEAST THEY SHOULD BE BRINGING FORWARD SERIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THEY COULD RE FLOAT A STEEL INDUSTRY THEY NEED AN INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG LONG TIME BUT FORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE GOT IS
A BUNCH OF BILLS WHAT SEEMS TO CONNECT THEM IS A SENSE THAT IF YOU FLOAT THESE THINGS OFF IF YOU TAKE SCHOOLS OR PRISONS OR ANYTHING ELSE OUT OF LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE THINGS IMPROVE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO BUY INTO THAT

BUT HE'S BEEN WRITING SCRIPTS SINCE HE WAS A PUPIL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS IN NEW YORK WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I WATCH THE WOODY ALLEN MOVIE AND I THOUGHT HE WAS SO WONDERFUL SO I WROTE A SCRIPT THAT WAS SET IN MODERN DAY BIT ABOUT HIM AND YET THAT I STARTED RIDING COS WHAT HAPPENED WAS SOMEBODY HAD READ IT AND I WAS FUNNY AND HE SAID TO AN AGENT AND THEY SENT TO A MANAGER AND HE SAID TO HIS LAWYER WHO SENT ME A CEASE AND DESIST MATTER ONCE A MONTH AND SO I PUT THAT THING DOWN BUT I REALISED I HAD THE SKILL SET OF RAIDING HUMOUR CHARACTER AND DIALOGUE AND A IT
JESSE EISENBERG HAS GONE ON TO APPEAR IN TWO WITH WOODY ALLEN'S FILMS INCLUDING HIS LATEST MOVIE CAFE SOCIETY AND I'M SO HAPPY JUST A BUT NOW ARMY TYRE
DIRECTOR HE'S FACED ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE WOODY ALLEN IS A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE DID THAT GIVE YOU ANY PAUSE FOR THOUGHT WHEN IT CAME TO DECIDING WHETHER TO WORK WITH HIM OR NOT
NO I MEAN I CAN ASSESS THE YOU KNOW NO NO IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO KIND OF GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY INTERACTION TO HIM HAVE BEEN FRANKLY MINIMAL ON A SOCIAL LEVEL AND VERY WONDERFUL AND CHORDS ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BUT YOU'LL BE AWARE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I MIGHT
INSENSITIVE TO I MEAN I'M AWARE OF THAT STUFF IN FACT I SPENT THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WORKING AT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER IN INDIANA RAISING MONEY TO PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGE I'M AWARE OF THIS STUFF AS A SOCIETY SHOULD WE DISCUSS SOMEBODY'S LEGAL OR PRIVATE MATTERS I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE COURTS AND LEGAL MATTERS AND IT'S WHY PEOPLE SHOULD USE THOSE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS ATTRACTIVE ON THE PRESS NONETHELESS JESSE EISENBERG KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE INTENSE SCRUTINY THAT COMES WITH STARDOM
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP WHINGEING ABOUT THE TRAPPINGS OF FAME I HAVE BEEN NOT RECOGNISABLE OR NOT NO AND IT'S A REAL STRUGGLE IF I WAS IN MOVIES ACTUALLY PLAYS UNKNOWN TO PRODUCE MY PLAY AND I WOULD READ MY PLACE AND NOW I GET RECOGNISED IN THE SUBWAY OCCASIONALLY HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH SOMEBODY BUT LOOK AT WHAT I GET IT'S INCREDIBLE THERE'S AND SOME ACTORS I THINK YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN COS THEIR PRIVACY IS INVADED FOR EXAMPLE KRISTEN STEWART IS IN THE MOVIE WITH ME HELICOPTERS FLYING OVER BUT FOR ME THE BENEFITS OF MY PUBLIC
PRESENCE OUTWEIGH TO SUCH AN UNBELIEVABLY DISPROPORTIONATE DEGREE THE ANNOYANCE AS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING I QUESTION I MEAN I'VE HAD SOME STRANGE SITUATIONS AND RUN INS WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE LESS THAN FRIENDLY BUT I MEAN THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED AND A BENEFITS GREATLY OUTWEIGH IT AND WHEN YOU SAY UNFRIENDLY SITUATIONS WHAT PEOPLE INTERNET TROLLS WERE ACTUALLY BEING READ TO YOUR FACE OH IT'S STUCK
OH GOSH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YEAH YEAH BUT I MEAN BESIDES THAT IT'S BEEN FINE IS THAT ALL SORTED THOUGH I'M DOING FINE WHAT HE HAS GOT TO WORRY ABOUT NOW HE SAYS HE'S MAKING HIS DEBUT ON THE WEST END STAGE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S GOT EVERY NIGHT THIS SHOW STARTED SEVEN THIRTY OR EIGHT O'CLOCK WHATEVER EVERY NIGHT AND I SPEND THE FIRST TEN HOURS OF MY DAY IN A PANIC ABOUT THAT SHOW ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE SHOW ENDS AND OVER BETTER HALF AN HOUR OF RELAXATION AND THEN START TO GO
REBEKAH JONES THERE REPORTING AND IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE EVERY PRISONER IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE GIVEN A TAILORED PERSONAL LEARNING PLAN UNDER NEW REFORMS TO PRISON EDUCATION AND THE PRISON A PRISON GOVERNOR WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT
PROGRESS THAT THEY MAKE AT LEAST THOSE ARE AMONG THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A REVIEW OF PRISON EDUCATION BY THE FORMER HEAD TEACHER DAME SALLY COATS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT EXCEPT IN PRINCIPLE
THE AIM IS TO CUT REOFFENDING BY BETTER REHABILITATION AND DAME SALLY JOINS US FROM BRIGHTON WERE ALSO JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO FIRST BY KELLY JUDGE YOU AS A FORMER PRISONER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING KELLY WOULD IT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE TO YOU IF YOU HAD BETTER EDUCATION IN PRISON
I BELIEVE THAT IN PRISON THERE WAS AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THERE
THAT IS TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHEN POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD HAVE HAD ANY EFFECT ON ME AS A PERSON BECAUSE YOU WERE IN AND OUT OF PRISON FOR TENURE OVER THE PAST AND I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF PRISON SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TO MARCH THIS YEAR
AND ON AND WHEN YOU GET IN WHAT ARE YOU OFFERED WHEN YOU GO IN
IT'S PRETTY STAGNANT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS YOU DON'T REALLY DO MUCH
AND THEN SOMETIMES THEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON AT THE OFFICES TO GET YOU ON THE LIST FOR INDUCTION SO THEY'LL BE AN INDUCTION FOR ENGLISH THERE'LL BE AN INDUCTION FOR MATHS THERE'LL BE AN INDUCTION FOR I.T. AND JIM AND BECAUSE OF THAT
HOW LONG WAS IT BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY GOT ANY FORM OF LESSONS OR HELP OR ANY EDUCATION THE SHORT IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS THE LONGEST HE'S BEEN TWELVE WEEKS RIGHT AND PRESUMABLY BUT NEW SO YOU DON'T THINK IT MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE DURO IT RE OFFENDED CAUSE A BIT OF THE PROPOSALS HERE ARE ABOUT IMPROVING THEIR REOFFENDING RICK I BELIEVE THAT I'M NOT A STUPID PERSON UM I WENT INTO PRISON BEFORE START GOING TO PRISON AND I HAD AN EDUCATION
AND I KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HAVING AN EDUCATIONAL STOP PEOPLE COMMITTING CRIME LET ME BRING IN DAME SALLY COATS HERE BECAUSE THAT IS THE OVERARCHING AIM OF IT ISN'T IT IT ABSOLUTELY IS WE SPEND BETWEEN NINE AND THIRTEEN BILLION AS A COUNTRY ON RE OFFENDING AT THE MOMENT SO THE THE MAIN AIM OF OF EDUCATION IS TO STOP PEOPLE REOFFENDING AND ENABLE THEM TO LIVE FULFILLING LIVES WHEN THEY RE ENTER SOCIETY
A CASE STUDY HERE KELLY JUDGE IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR BUT YOUR PRESUMPTION IS THAT IT WILL FOR OTHERS I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION WE TALK ABOUT IT IT'S BROADER SENSE IS NOT JUST SITTING IN A CLASSROOM LEARNING ENGLISH OR MATHS ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S ALSO LEARNING TRADING IS HEADING FOR A JOB LEARNING SKILLS THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO
TO ENTER THEY SAY BACK INTO SOCIETY AND DO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE SO AND IT'S ALSO SUFFER IS ABOUT GAINING CONFIDENCE AND SELF ESTEEM AND HERSELF WORSE AS WELL AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT PRISONERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO EYE PADS ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS EDUCATION WELL IT'S TYPICAL THAT THEY KIND OF MEDIA HAVE MADE A BIG THING ABOUT EYE PADS WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE TECHNOLOGY AT THEIR FINGERTIPS HAVE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY
AND WE NEED TO RISK ASSESS PRISONERS AND WHERE WE CONSIDER IT THAT WE CAN DO IT THERE WE SHOULD ENABLE TECHNOLOGY AFTER ALL IF YOU ARE LOCKED UP FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR TIME YOU CAN USE HIS CELL TECHNOLOGY TO LEARN AND TO EDUCATE YOURSELF AND TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT IN YOUR STUDY WHAT KELLY IS DESCRIBING IS ABSOLUTELY REAL
I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SAT AROUND IN SALES BEFORE THEY WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO EDUCATION AND IT'S WHAT MY REPORT REALLY SAYS IS THAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE A PRIORITY IN ITS BROADER SENSE EDUCATION SKILLS AND TRAIN TRAINING
RATHER THAN SECURITY LET ME GET MY CARRIAGE BRING KELLY JUDGE BACK IN ON THAT BECAUSE IF YOU HAD HAD SOMETHING THAT WAS TAILORED FOR WHAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN COULD IT HAVE BEEN A FOCUS THAT WOULD'VE STOPPED YOU GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE DOING IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE DOING TIME IN PRISON AND THE WAITING LISTS ARE SO LONG GETTING ON TO GROUPS THAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO HAIR AND BEAUTY DESIGN TECHNOLOGY
THE REAL FOCUSED EDUCATION'S GAMES YOUR WAY IN TIME IS IMMENSE SO IF YOU'RE JUST DOING LITTLE TO IT WAS SENSES IT'S NOT WORTH IT WHAT SAYS SALLY CASE I MEAN ULTIMATELY IF YOU'VE GOT THE PRISON NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE NOW CAN ANY OF THE INTRODUCTION OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT MAKE A DIFFERENCE JUST BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE OF NUMBERS
I REALLY HOPE SO BECAUSE I THINK ONCE WE GIVE GOVERNORS THE RIGHTS TO GOVAN WE GIVE THEM THEIR OWN BUDGET WE GIVE THEM ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT AS WELL AS THE AUTONOMY TO USE IT THEN THEY WILL BE THINKING MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY ABOUT DEPLOYMENT OF STAFF AND PRISONERS LIKE KELLY IS
SITTING IN THE SADDLE DOING ACTIVITIES WHICH AREN'T REALLY LEADING ANYWHERE ARE THEN TAKEN TO THE EDUCATION BLOCK ARE TAKEN TO THE HAIR AND BEAUTY SALON ARE GIVEN THE TRADING BECAUSE GOVERNORS PUT EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY AND THAT'S HOW THEY DEPLOY THEIR STAFF THEN SALLY COATS KELLY JUDGE THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU THANK YOU
IT IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE HAS LORD O'NEILL GEMMA O'NEILL COME UP WITH A WORKABLE PLAN TO SAVE THE WORLD OF MODERN MEDICINE THAT'S WHAT MANY THINK HE'S TASK HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS FEARFUL THAT ANTIBIOTICS ARE FAILING AND NOTHING MUCH IS COMING IN THEIR PLACE AND THEIR NEW ANTIBIOTICS IN THE PIPELINE AND DRUG COMPANIES NOT THAT INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THEM LAURA PADDOCK IS A PROFESSOR OF MICROBIOLOGY AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY AND IS ON THE LINE OR SO'S MARK WILL HOUSE IS PROFESSOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY UNIVERSE DEVELOPED THE MORNING TO YOU BOTH
GOOD MORNING MADAM MARK HAD AT FIRST WERE YOU YOU ADVISE THEM DIDN'T YOU DO YOU THINK THEY'VE COME UP WITH A GOOD AND USEFUL PIECE OF WORK
YES I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT ROAD MAP OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I'VE COME UP WITH TWO VERY INTERESTING PROPOSALS FOR HOW THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WHICH ARE
SO ONE IS A GLOBAL INNOVATION FUND TO STIMULATE BASIC SCIENCE INCLUDING EARLY DISCOVERY OF POSSIBLE NEW TARGETS FOR DRUGS AND INDEED COMPOUNDS THAT COULD FORM YOU DRUGS OF THE FUTURE
AND THEN SECONDLY THEY'VE COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF A REWARD SYSTEM FOR BIG DRUG COMPANIES THAT TAKE ON THESE NEW DISCOVERIES AND DEVELOPED THEM AND MAKE THEM INTO DRUGS FOR PATIENCE WHILE WILL HAS EVER LEFT ANYTHING OFF IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THAT THEY'D GONE DOWN IN THE WAY OF ROUTES TO SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTION THAT THEY HAVEN'T
LIKE LAURA I VERY MUCH WELCOME THE REPORT AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS GATHER THE EVIDENCE AND MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT PUT ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE FIRMLY ON THE GLOBAL POLITICAL GENDER AS WELL AS THEIR ECONOMIC AGENDA AND I THINK THAT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT THAT THEY'VE RAISED THE PROFILE OF THIS PROBLEM SO THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH THE G.TWENTY OR THE UN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH CONCRETE ACTION AT A GLOBAL SCALE
THAT THAT'S WHAT I HOPE THIS REPORT WILL ACHIEVE BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THEY'VE LEFT OUT AN ORDER OR A MILLION OTHER OTHER AREAS DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE POINT THAT THIS VERY THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT THEY MAKE TEN RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH I WON'T GO
NOW THERE'S ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS THEY COULD DO THEY RECOMMEND SETTING TARGETS FOR ANTI MICROBIAL CONSUMPTION IN THE FOOD ANIMAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK POSSIBLY WE ALSO NEED TARGETS FOR THE MEDICAL USE OF THESE DRUGS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCUSSED
WE ALSO AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANTLY TO TRAIN THE MEDICS MISS WHAT WE DO IN THE UNIVERSE TO TRAIN THE MEDICS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBED AND I THINK IT'S A GENERATIONAL ISSUE I THINK THIS NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE THAN CURRENT PRACTITIONER THAT'S ACTUALLY SUNNY JIM AND HE'LL MENTION TO US AN HOUR OR SO AGO AS BEING SOMETHING THAT HE REGARDED AS AS IMPORTANT THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE A CHANGE IN THE DOCTOR'S SURGERY I THINK THAT'S QUITE RIGHT
LORD O'NEILL CONCENTRATED VERY MUCH ON ON THE SHORT TERM FOR IMMEDIATE ACTIONS AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND ONE OF US YOU'RE TRAINING MEDICS AND THEIR ATTITUDE TO SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER IN THE VERY LONG TERM I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEAN OURSELVES OFF ANTIBIOTICS CERTAINLY THE WAY WE USE THEM NOWADAYS ALMOST COMPLETELY BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM IS SIMPLY GOING TO COME BACK IF WE DO MANAGE TO GENERATE NEW ANTIBIOTICS RESISTANCE IS VERY LIKELY TO EVOLVE TO THOSE WHEN THEY WERE IN THE SAME POSITION SO WE NEED TO BE
IMPORTANT RADICAL SHIFT IN THINKING SO THAT WE START USING OTHER MEANS OF CONTROLLING THE KINDS OF DISEASES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS ANTIBIOTICS CURRENTLY ADDRESSED THAT'S BETTER DO YOU SYMPATHISE WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES SAY AT THE MOMENT THERE JUST ISN'T A PROPER COMMERCIAL MODEL THAT ENCOURAGES THEM TO TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
I THINK SYMPATHISES THE WRONG TERMITE UNDERSTAND THEIR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE SHAREHOLDERS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE MONEY FOR
MY CONCERN IS THAT HOW MUCH MONEY DO COMPANIES NEED TO MAKE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT AREA OF MEDICINE THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS UNDERPINS ALL AREAS OF MEDICINE AND
WE NEED MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF TREATING INFECTIONS BUT ANTIBIOTICS ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH DOCTORS AND PATIENTS IS A TREATMENT PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH YEAH BUT IT'S A TREATMENT YOU CAN'T MAKE MONEY OUT OF WIG WE ACCEPT THAT IN THE WORLD WITH COMPANIES EXIST TO MAKE MONEY AS PART OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AND A DRUGS COMPANY
BILL'S AMOUNT ABOUT EVEN DOES THE RESEARCH POSSIBLY RESEARCHER DOESN'T LEAD ANYWHERE IS NOT NECESSARILY PROPERLY REWARDED AT THE MOMENT WELL THAT'S BEEN SAID AND SOME COMPANIES HAVE INDEED PRODUCED EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THAT SO THIS IS WHY THE O'NEILL REVIEW HAS COME UP WITH THE REWARD SYSTEM AND THE REWARD SYSTEM PROPOSED IS THAT
COMPANIES WOULD RECEIVE A PAYMENT FOR MAKING THE DRUGS WHEN THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY USED SO THAT
MAKING A NEW DRUG AND SELLING IT DE LINKED
WELL LAURA PUT THAT PROFESSOR PROFESSOR MARK WILL HOUSE AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH DON'T TIS SMOKE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE TIMES NOW THREE MINUTES TO NINE AND EGYPT AIRPLANE FLYING OVERNIGHT FROM PARIS TO CAIRO HAS DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR SCREENS IN EGYPTIAN AIRSPACE OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN WE'VE BEEN REPORTING THE NEWS SINCE WE FIRST HEARD IT BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR THIS MORNING OFFICIAL SAY IT PROBABLY CRASH THERE WAS SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD INCLUDING ONE BRITISH CITIZEN
FRANK GARDNER A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW AND FRANK BECAUSE HE DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE THE SUGGESTION IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A MID AIR EXPLOSION
WELL YES AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO KEEP A VERY OPEN MIND ON THIS AT THE MOMENT PUT IT INEVITABLY THE SPECTRE OF TERRORISM HOVERS OVER THIS INSTANT BECAUSE IT WAS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IT WAS ONLY SEVEN MONTHS AGO THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ROUBLE TO SMUGGLE A BOMB ON BOARD A RUSSIAN METRIC JET FLYING OUT OF SOMEWHAT SHAKEN EGYPT TO RUSSIA AND BLEW IT UP OVER THE SINAI KILLING EVERYBODY ON BOARD
ALSO HIJACK FROM ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO IN MARCH WHICH ENDED PEACEFULLY
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS PLANE WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO REALLY I SUPPOSE EFFECTIVELY TO WAR ZONES THE SYRIAN ONE AND ALSO A KIND OF LOO GREAT WAR ZONE IN THE SINAI IS GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY WAS IT BROUGHT DOWN BY TERRORISTS
AIRPORT SECURITY OF PARIS SHOULDER GO AIRPORT IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT ONE OF THINGS THAT'S WORRYING PEOPLE IS THAT THERE ARE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND WORKERS AIRPORT WORKERS IN FRANCE WHO'VE GOT
OUR SIDE CLEARANCE AND RECENTLY FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS AND IN PARIS SIXTY OF THOSE HAD THEIR AUTHORISATION WITHDRAWN BECAUSE THERE WAS FEAR THAT THEY COULD BE ISLAMIC RADICALS
SO THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY AT THAT IS IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT THE HEIGHT AND LOCATION OF THE PLANE DOES IT MEAN THAT WE CAN RULE OUT THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN BY SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND
BUT HE WAS FLYING AT A NORMAL CRUISING HEIGHT OF AROUND ELEVEN THOUSAND METRES THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FEET SO IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A KIND OF HAND HELD SO CALLED MAN PAD
YOU KNOW A KIND OF MAN PORTABLE AIR DEFENCE SYSTEM IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BEEN SOMETHING LIKE THE BOOK DRAGGED ALMOST A TANK BASICALLY THAT THAT THAT FOUND SOMETHING RIGHT UP AT HIGH ALTITUDE SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY UNLIKELY IF IT WAS TERRORISM IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WAS SMUGGLED ON BOARD
FRANK GARDNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S IT FROM US MELVYN BRAGG AND GUESTS DISCUSS THE MUSES AND THEIR ROLE IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY IN AND OUR TIME IN A FEW MOMENTS TIME EDITORS THIS MORNING WERE JOHN LAWS AND JONATHAN HARVEY FROM SARAH AND FROM ME GOOD MORNING

THESE PLANES ARE SO RELIABLE THESE DAYS VERY RARELY DO THEY HAVE MALFUNCTIONS THAT WOODEN AT LEAST INFORM THE GRANT AND CERTAINLY THE PILOT'S THEN WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE SO I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT IT'S SO DRAMATIC IT'S SO QUICK AND THAT POINTS REALLY TOWARDS SOME KIND OF AN EXPLOSION
A LEADING CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGNER FOR LEAVING THE E.U. HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF BEING BEHIND VICIOUS ATTACKS ON TORIES WHO SUPPORT BRECK'S IT THE M.P. STEVE BAKER WARNED THAT SUCH ACTION RISK CAUSING LASTING DIVISIONS WITHIN THE PARTY SPOKESMAN FOR NUMBER TEN SAYS IT DOESN'T ACCEPT THE CLAIMS

C. TELLS US THAT THERE WERE NINE OF THEM THAT THEY WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZEUS AND OF MEMORY AND THAT THEY WERE THE ONES TO INSPIRE HIM AND GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO COMPOSE HIS VERSE THEIR NAMES NUMBERS CHANGE BUT CONSISTENTLY THE MUSES BECAME A WAY TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POET OR CREATIVE IMAGINATION AND INSPIRATION
