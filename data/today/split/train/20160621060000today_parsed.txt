GOOD MORNING IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE TWENTY FIRST OF JUNE THIS IS TODAY WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON'S FORMER DIRECTOR A STRATEGY HAS SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TOLD BY WHITEHALL OFFICIALS FOUR YEARS AGO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION WHILE REMAINING IN THE E.U. THE BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR GEORGE SAW US AS WARNED THAT LEAVING THE E.U. COULD CAUSE A BLACK FRIDAY THIS WEEK
A BRITISH MAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SHOOT DONALD TRUMP AT A RALLY IN LAS VEGAS AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME A FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA TELLS OF HIS DECISION NOT TO BOMB SYRIA OVER ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS WAS A MISTAKE HAVING SAID THAT THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD BE A RED LINE FOR THE UNITED STATES IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BACK THAT UP
AND WELSH FANS CELEBRATE THEIR EURO SUCCESS OH MY GOD
NEVER COULD BE FORGOTTEN NOW OVER THE MAIN ITS FIFTH DAY NOW A LITTLE CRY
PREVIOUSLY NEWS READ BY SUSAN RAY WITH TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE E.U. REFERENDUM DAVID CAMERON'S IMMIGRATION POLICY HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY A MAN WHO WAS ONCE A CLOSE FRIEND AND ADVISOR STEVE HILTON A FORMER DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY AT NUMBER TEN SAID MISTER CAMERON WAS TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO BY HIS OWN OFFICIALS THAT CUTTING THAT MIGRATION TO THE TARGET OF UNDER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHILE INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION MY HILLS AND SAID IT WAS DISHONEST TO CONTINUE TO INSIST THEIR TARGET WAS ACHIEVABLE
MAKING PROMISES THAT CLEARLY CAN'T BE KEPT IS NOT A GOOD WAY
TO BUILD TRUST IN POLITICS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND THE FACT THAT IT'S CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ANY BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THE LEVEL OF IMMIGRATION AS LONG AS WE'RE IN THE E.U. AND YET STILL PROMISING TO DO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT UNDERMINES TRUST IN POLITICS
A DOWNING STREET SPOKESMAN SAID THEY DID NOT RECOGNISE MY HILTON STORY THE BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR GEORGE SAW US SAYS LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD TRIGGER A DAMAGING FALL IN STIRLING HAVE POSSIBLY MORE THAN FIFTEEN PER CENT TRIGGERING A BLACK FRIDAY THIS WEEK MORE SERIOUS THAN WHEN BRITAIN WAS FORCED OUT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM HE ALSO SAYS BRITISH PEOPLE ARE GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATING THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE U. BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JONTY BOOM REPORTS
GEORGE SAW US MADE HIS NAME IN AROUND ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT WHEN HE BET MASSIVELY ON THE POUND BEING FORCED OUT OF THE E.R.M. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IT MADE HIM A FORTUNE AND REPUTATION AS AN INSIGHTFUL INVESTOR NOW WRITING IN THE GUARDIAN HE WARNS THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING A PRECIPITOUS FALL IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND THAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE ONE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO
AND THAT WOULD BE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON FINANCIAL MARKETS INVESTMENT PRICES AND JOBS BELIEVE CAMPAIGN CALLED MY OSAURUS A LONGSTANDING ADVOCATE OF BRITAIN JOINED THE EURO AND OF GIVING FURTHER CONTROL TO THE E.U.
A BRITISH MAN HAS APPEARED IN COURT IN LAS VEGAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SHOOT DONALD TRUMP AT A RALLY ON SATURDAY MICHAEL SANDFORD WHO'S TWENTY IS ALLEGED TO HAVE TRIED TO WRESTLE A GUN FROM A POLICE OFFICER THE SECRET SERVICE SAID MISTER SANDFORD HAD BEEN PLANNING THE ATTACK FOR A YEAR COURT PAPERS SAID HE MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES AROUND EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
THE U.S. SENATE HAS REJECTED FOR MEASURES TO TIGHTEN GUN CONTROLS FOLLOWING THE ATTACK AT A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA IN WHICH FORTY NINE PEOPLE WERE KILLED THE PROPOSALS INCLUDED RESTRICTING SALES OF WEAPONS TO THOSE ON TERRORISM WATCH LISTS
FIGURES SUGGEST THE INTERNET HAS BEEN USED IN ENGLAND AND WALES TO COMMIT EIGHT SEXUAL OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN EVERY DAY THE CHARITY THE ENNIS PK OBTAINED THE DATA AFTER SUBMITTING FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST TO POLICE FORCES HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
THE N.S.P.C.C. SAYS THE FIGURES CONFIRM ITS FEARS THAT THE INTERNET IS PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN IN THE TWELVE MONTHS TO THE END OF MARCH POLICE RECORDED MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEXUAL OFFENCES THAT HAD AN ONLINE ELEMENT TO THEM THEY INCLUDED INCITING CHILDREN TO TAKE PART IN A SEXUAL ACT GROOMING VICTIMS BEFORE MEETING THEM AND LIVE STREAMING ABUSE IT'S THE FIRST TIME POLICE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO FLAG CRIMES WHICH INVOLVE THE INTERNET SO COMPARISONS WITH PREVIOUS YEARS ON POSSIBLE
NEVERTHELESS THE TRUE TOTAL IS LIKELY TO BE FAR HIGHER BECAUSE SIX FORCES INCLUDING THE METROPOLITAN POLICE DIDN'T PROVIDE DATA AND THE FIGURES DON'T ENCOMPASS CRIMES WHICH AREN'T REPORTED TO POLICE
NURSES ARE WARNING THAT RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE U.K. A PUTTING PATIENTS AT RISK OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER REPORTS FROM THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF NURSING'S ANNUAL CONGRESS IN GLASGOW

THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU NEED STAB IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THEIR MORNING PAPERS THE GUARDIAN LEADS ON THE STORY THAT WE'RE LEADING ON AN ARTICLE WRITTEN FOR THEM BY GEORGE SAW US OF COURSE THE MAN HE MADE SO MUCH MONEY BETTING AGAINST THE POUND OFF THAT ON WHAT BECAME BLACK WEDNESDAY HE IS NOW PREDICTING A BLACK FRIDAY ONCE THE RESULTS ARE KNOWN OF THE REFERENDUM IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. HE SAYS THAT THIS WOULD CAUSE
HUGE CONSEQUENCES IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE MAKING PEOPLE QUOTES MOST VOTERS QUOTES CONSIDERABLY POORER NOW THE PAPERS ARE INTERESTED IN THE MARKET REACTION AS WELL THE TIMES FROM PAGE POUNDS SAWS AS MARKETS BET ON HONOUR REMAIN VICTORY IN OTHER WORDS REFLECTING THE FACT THAT SOME OPINION POLLS SHOWED REMAIN PULLING CLOSER AGAIN I MEAN NOT NOT FROM WAY AHEAD IN TRUTH IT WAS NECK AND NECK
BUT MAKING SO SOME PROGRESS AND THAT LED TO THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED YESTERDAY A JUMPING BY THREE PER CENT THE F. TEARS WELL STIRLING AND STOCKS RALLY AS POLES NARROW AHEAD OF E.U. REFERENDUM AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH YOU VOTE GOES DOWN TO THE WIRE THE LAST TELEGRAPH POLE SHOWING THE PAPER SAYS AN OUTCOME OF REFERENDUM THAT IS STILL UNCERTAIN DESPITE
SURGE AS IT PUTS IT TOWARDS REMAIN BUT MUCH MORE PROMINENT THAN THAT RIGHT ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE IN RED LETTERS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IF THIS THURSDAY'S REFERENDUM IS A CHOICE BETWEEN FEAR AND HOPE THEN WE CHOOSE HOPE THERE WAS LONG EDITORIAL INSIDE THE PAPER SUPPORTING ABOUT TO LEAVE
ONCE AGAIN IT'S A SIMPLE PATTERN IF THE PAPER'S IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THERE I LIKE THE ECONOMY IF THEY'RE IN FAVOUR OF GETTING ELVES THEY HIGHLIGHT IMMIGRATION SO THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE CAMERON'S MIGRATION DECEPTION QUOTING STEVE HILTON WE HAD HIM IN THE NEWS THAT DIDN'T WITH THE MAN HE USED TO WORK SO CLOSELY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING THAT HE'D BEEN WARNED YEARS AGO DIRECTLY AND EXPLICITLY THAT IS TENS OF THOUSANDS
MIGRATION TARGET COULD NOT POSSIBLY MEET MET WHILE WE WERE IN THE E.U. THE SON HAS A HEADLINE ABOUT WHAT HE CALLS A CALAIS MIGRANT RIOTS WITH THE HEADLINE LETTERS IN BEFORE YOU VOTE OUT ILLEGAL STORM FERRY PORT TO THE U.K.
THE TIME IS TEN PAST SIX A YOUNG BRITISH MAN HAS APPEARED IN COURT IN LAS VEGAS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO KILLED DONALD TRUMP JAMES COOK IS CORRESPONDENT IS OUTSIDE THE HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS WHERE THIS IS ALLEGED TO HAVE HAPPENED AND WHAT EXACTLY DID HAPPEN JAMES
WHAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY AT A DONALD TRUMP RALLY WAS THAT OUR MAN WAS REMOVED FROM THAT RALLY HE WAS TAKEN AWAY AND WHAT THE SECRET SERVICE ALLEGE HAPPENED IS THAT HE TRIED TO GRAB A GUN OF UNIFORMED LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICER AND THEN WHEN THE SECRET SERVICE BEGAN TO CONDUCT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND BEGAN TO INTERVIEW THIS MAN WHOSE NAME IS MICHAEL STEPHEN SANDFORD
TWENTY YEARS OLD AND FROM THE U.K. THEY THEN FOUND OUT THEY SAY THAT HE HAD INTENDED TO KILL DONALD TRUMP IS HEAVIER DRIVEN FROM CALIFORNIA UP HERE TO NEVADA TO DO SO AND THAT HE HAD BEEN PLANNING TO DO SORT OF BUY FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THAT HE EXPECTED TO DIE IN THAT ATTEMPT
WE'RE STILL IN THE DAY BEFORE YOU AT THE MOMENT HERE IN LAS VEGAS AND HE APPEARED IN COURT A FEW HOURS AGO NO PLEA AT THIS STAGE NO FORMAL AN EXACT CHARGES AT THIS STAGE A HOLDING CHARGE REALLY OF COMMITTING AN ACT OF VIOLENCE ON RESTRICTED AND HE WAS REFUSED BAIL SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW
WELL NOW ANOTHER COURT APPEARANCE HAS BEEN SET FORWARDS ALIVE LIVE FISTS AND WHILE WE AWAIT THAT HAPPENING THERE WAS SOME MORE DETAILS OF THE COURSE ABOUT THE MAN HIMSELF HIS LAWYER WHO WAS APPOINTED BY THE COURT OF PUBLIC DEFENDER APPOINTED BY THE COURT TALKED ABOUT HIM HAVING AUTISM PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING SUICIDE OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT HE'D HAD A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS ALTHOUGH SHE SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY DIAGNOSED WITH ONE IN HE APPEARED TO BE
COMPETENT TO TAKE PART IN THESE PROCEEDINGS HE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN LIVING OUT OF HIS CAR AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB AND HE WAS IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY AFTER OVERSTAYING A VISA BUT OF COURSE JUST THE WIDER PICTURE HERE IS A PICTURE WHERE WE ARE SEEING AT RALLY AFTER RALLY
IF IT'S NOT VERY SERIOUS VIOLENCE OF THE POTENTIAL NATURE HERE SINCE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SERIOUS BUT OF LOW TO MEDIUM LEVEL VIOLENCE THREATS FIGHTING PUNCHES BEING THROWN A REALLY VOLATILE AND FEBRILE ATMOSPHERE IN U.S. POLITICS I THINK WITH THE ARREST PEOPLE OR JUST WONDERING AND WORRYING WHERE IT MIGHT LEAD
WELL WE WILL STAY IN TOUCH WITH JAMES COOK TIME IN THANKS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX LET THE TRAIN TAKE THE STRAIN THAT'S AN ADVERTISING SLOGAN UNLIKELY TO BE REVIVED ANY TIME SOON THERE'S ANOTHER STRIKE ON SOUTHERN RAIL AND IT IS CAUSING HUGE DISRUPTION FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS INTO LONDON THERE'S ONE HAPPENING IN SCOTT REAL TOO WILL HEAR ABOUT THAT ONE LATER BUT FIRST LET'S GO TO PAUL CLIFTON THE B. B. C. SELF TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU PAUL
WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THE DISRUPTION WE CAN EXPECT THIS MORNING MORNING THIS WILL BE A MISERABLE ONE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS CUVIER TIMBERLAND RAILWAY CARRIES SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PASSENGER JOURNEYS A DAY THAT IS ONE IN FIVE OF ALL RAIL PASSENGERS IN THE COUNTRY
THE STRIKE IS GOING TO HOLD MANY SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THERE'LL BE NO SOUTHERN TRAINS TODAY BETWEEN CHICHESTER PORTSMOUTH AND SOUTHAMPTON ON OTHER ROUTES THERE'LL BE A SKELETON SERVICE BETWEEN HALF PAST SIX IN THE MORNING AND SIX IN THE EVENING THE TRAIN COMPANY SAYS THEY WILL BE CROWDED AND IT CANNOT GUARANTEE TO GET EVERYONE HOME AND THIS DISPUTE IS MESSING UP COUNTLESS LIVES NOW NOT JUST ON STRIKE DAYS YESTERDAY AGAIN DOZENS OF SERVICES WERE CANCELLED
BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH STAFF TO RUN ALL THE TRAINS HAVE A DISPUTE ABOUT WHO OPENS AND CLOSES TRAIN DOORS ISN'T IT IT IS YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO KIND OF THE SAFETY ISSUES HERE WHAT WHAT ARE THEY OH KAY ON SIXTY PER CENT OF GO VIA TERMS IN RAILWAY SERVICES THE DRIVER OPENS THE DOORS ON FORTY PERCENT THE CONDUCTOR DOES IT AND THE M. T. UNIONS KEY ARGUMENT IS THAT HAVING A GOD OPERATE THE DOOR IS SAFER THAN WHAT THE INDUSTRY CALLS DRIVER ONLY OPERATION
WE ASKED THE RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD TO GO THROUGH THE EVIDENCE IT SAYS HE DOESN'T TAKE SIDES IT JUST GIVES THE FACTS THAT IS FUNDED BY THE RAIL INDUSTRY AND IT SAYS OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS NO WORK HAS IDENTIFIED ANY INCREASED RISK FROM DISPATCHING A TRAIN WITHOUT A GUARD BEING PRESENT AND IT GOES FURTHER IT SAYS DRIVER ONLY OPERATION WITHOUT A GUARD MAY ACTUALLY BE SAFER BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE POSSIBILITY
OF MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE GUARD IF THE WHOLE RAILWAY HAD DRIVERS OPERATING THE DOORS IT SAYS THIS WOULD BE SAFETY NEUTRAL
IS IT POSSIBLE BRIEFLY PAUL TO SEE AN END TO THIS DISPUTE OR DOES IT JUST FEEL LIKE IT IS GOING ON AND ON ON G.T. R. IN PARTICULAR THIS IS BECOMING A VITRIOLIC SLANGING MATCH EACH SIDE HAS ACCUSED THE OTHER OF LYING ONE IN SIX GARDENS BEEN REPORTING IN SICK THE COMPANY AND THE GOVERNMENT SAY THAT AMOUNTS TO AN OFFICIAL STRIKE ACTION
THEY WENT TO THE CONCILIATION SERVICE THEY CAST THEY FOUND NO COMMON GROUND AND EACH SIDE IS LEAVING NO WRIGGLE ROOM TO NEGOTIATE A WAY OUT OF THIS WITH HONOUR SO THE COMPANY HAS DECIDED TO IMPOSE THE CHANGES WHETHER THE GUARDS LIKE IT OR NOT FROM AUGUST
PAUL PAUL CLIFTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE R.M.T. UNION LATER IN THE PROGRAMME I KNOW I'VE GOT A PAST SIX ANOTHER BIG COMPANIES SPEAKING OUT ON THE REFERENDUM THIS MORNING THIS TIME IT'S VODAFONE AND DOMINIC ARE COMMONERS HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST THE BUSINESS THEY CHRIS' JUSTIN YOU CIVIL FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES HAVE WRITTEN TO THEIR STAFF OVER THE LAST WEEK SAYING THEY WANT BRITAIN TO STAY IN EUROPE
WE'VE NOT HAD MUCH FROM VODAFONE WHICH REALLY IS A BIG BEAST THE SEVENTH LARGEST LISTED COMPANY ON THE LONDON MARKET WE KNOW IT'S IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN BUT A FEW MINUTES AGO PATRIK ALLOW THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE GAVE HIS FIRST INTERVIEW ON THE SUBJECT TO ME TO TELL EXACTLY WHY HE'S HE WANTS BUT BEN IT'S ALL TO DO WITH GETTING THE RIGHT ACCESS TO WHAT WILL BE A NEW BIG DIGITAL MARKET
WE THINK THE DEED THAT SINGLE MIGHT IT IS THE NEXT BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ECONOMY IN EUROPE IN GENERAL AND PAPRIKA AND IN PARTICULAR THE PREVIOUS INCARNATION OF THE DIGITAL MARGARET WAS GREAT FOR MANUFACTURING YOU THINK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE BUT THIS HAS GIVEN TO COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY
OR OR EVEN ITALY ANOTHER NEW ONE THE NEW THING IS COMING IS THE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET FOR A DISHED THEM GOODS DIGITAL SERVICES IS PARTICULARLY STRONG ECONOMIC
SO FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WOULD BE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY GRATE ME SOME GLEE EDITH
BRITAIN WAS TRYING TO SIT OUTSIDE OF IT AND NOT SHAPING IT FROM INSIDE BUT BRITAIN WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY FINE OUTSIDE OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULDN'T IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET AND TRADE IN THE SINGLE DIGITAL MARKET AND TRADE ALL AROUND THE WORLD IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A TREAT TO TRADE IN THE MARKET BUT IT WOULD NOT BE SHAPING THE RULES THAT TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES THE COMMISSION
AND THE GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IN TERMS OF E. COMMERCE DATA PROTECTION PRIVACY CYBER SECURITY ALL THE ELEMENTS OF WORK WOULD BE DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET PACKAGE THERE IN THE SECOND PART OF THE SEA WE'VE GOT SO SO THE QUESTION IS IS IT BETTER TO BE A NEIGHBOUR OF A GREAT MARKET OR TO BE A CORE ORNARA AND THE SHAPE
IT'S BRITAIN ALREADY BEING EXCLUDED FROM SOME OF THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE ABOUT THIS BIG NEWMARKET I THINK DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT FOR SURE IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAD BEEN WITNESSING A GREAT ACTIVISM OF ESSENTIALLY GERMANY AND FRANCE AND THE COMMISSION IN THIS AREA
AND IF I'M HONEST BRITAIN HAS BEEN RATHER OCCUPIED THAT WITH THE OTHER ASIA'S SO I WOULDN'T SEE EXCLUDED BUT PUSH WERE PASSIVE AND NOT
ANOTHER PEOPLE ARGUING IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN LEAVING EUROPE SAY THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WERE SPEAKING FOR A VESTED ELITE IN BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO THAT'S ALL PART OF A BIG BUSINESS DESIRE TO STAY WHERE WE ARE WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT WELL I I WOULDN'T AGREE I WOULD SAY THAT OUR CUSTOMERS WANT RURAL MEAN WANT
AND THE ELIMINATION OF OR NURSE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE FREELY PART OF A SINGLE TERRITORY I WOULD SAY THAT SURE ARE USING CONTENT AND THE ABILITY TO USE YOUR CONTENT IN EVERY EUROPEAN MARKET WHICH IS ANOTHER TOPIC THAT THE COMMISSION IS WORKING ON
HE'S VERY DEAR NOW TO EVERYBODY NOW THAT WE ALL DEPEND ON THE YOU KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THAT WE ARE GETTING THE EYE AND THE OTHER CONTENT THAT WE ALL TRAVEL WITH SO I WOULDN'T FIND THIS IN THE LEAD JUST CONCERNED I WOULD BE FINDING THIS BIG BULLY TICKLISH
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO BRITAIN IF IT WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES LIKE YOURSELVES MULTINATIONALS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE MARKET DO YOU THINK YOU AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOUR TO AN HUNDRED LEADERS MIGHT HAVE TO CONSIDER MOVING YOUR HEADQUARTERS
WHEN NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT BREAKS IT'S GOT REALLY WILBY AND NOBODY KNOWS THE SHEEP BUT THIS WOULD BE SO IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT IN PRINCIPLE WE LIKE BRITAIN WAS THEY WELL ENGRAVED AND THEN HAVING OUR HEAD PORTER IMBREKE AND HAS PROVED TO BE AN ADVANTAGE
GREG DID CLAMS WITH RESTRICTIONS OF MOMENT OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OR FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL THEN OF COURSE WE SHOULD LAURIE CONSIDER OUR POSITION BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AND IF IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS WITH HULL CHANGES TO THOSE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS I.Q. AND OTHER FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY CHIEF EXECUTIVES BEING ENCOURAGED BY NUMBER TIN TO GET OUT AND SPREAD THE WORD IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN REMAIN
THIS IS NOT REAL NEED TO ENQUIRE JESS WE AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK FOR MORE UP ON WE NEVER TAKE POSITION ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE SO WHO WOULD NOT SAY TO THE BRITISH BROUGHT US THIS IS
THE BEST WAY OF BOARDING ON THIS IS NOT A GOOD WAY OF AVOIDING THE PUSH WHERE WE FEEL AT ANY TIME THERE IS IN MUD
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES AND OUR SHAREHOLDER WE FEEL THE URGE TO SPEAK SO WE NEED IT ON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WE DO IT ON ELECTROMAGNETISM WE HAVE TO DO IT ON BREAKS
WERE LISTENING TO THAT INTERVIEW OF MY CLOW WAS JON MOULTON THE VETERAN VENTURE CAPITALIST WHO SET AND A GUERNSEY STUDIO HE'S A FOUNDER OF INVESTMENT FIRM BIFFER CAPITAL AND UNLIKE THE VODAFONE BOSS HE THINKS BRITAIN SHOULD LEAVE EUROPE
JOHN WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE CANAL'S ARGUMENTS THIN BITTER IN EUROPE I THINK YOU DON'T KNOW HIM AND FROM WHERE HE SETS THIS IS A MAN WHO'S TAKEN OUT WHAT SOMETHING NORTH OF FIVE MILLION POUNDS FROM THE COMPANY THE COMPANY IS DOING VERY WELL MAKING QUITE A LOT OF PROFITS BIT OF A DECLINE QUITE WE CAN
CHANGE WOULD COST HIM A FORTUNE SO HE LIKES REGULATION IT HELPS BIG COMPANIES HE'D ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES NEW ENTRANT IT MAKES FOR LESS LIVELY MARKET HOW MUCH REALLY WHAT A BIG PART OF WHAT THE DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE
IF WE STAY IN EUROPE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ONE MONSTER BUREAUCRACY ONCE WHICH ACTUALLY HELPS BIG COMPANIES HURTS LITTLE LAUNCH SO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING BUT IT'S NOT MUCH FUN SO THIS THIS REALLY IS WHAT THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN LEAVING IS ALL ABOUT ISN'T IT IT'S ALL ABOUT
DESTROYING THAT STATUS QUO WHICH VICTORIA CLOW REPRESENTS ITS DESTRUCT DESTROYING US PROBABLY OVER DAY AT CERTAINLY EATING INTO THE STATUS QUO IN THE BELIEF THAT AN ECONOMY FREE OF THE SHACKLES AND REMEMBER THE YEW AT IN TOTAL AS THE ECONOMY IS A MISERABLE FAILURE WITH VERY HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT LOW GROWTH THE GENTLEMAN WAS JUST TALKING TO HOME COUNTRY ITALY HAS GOT A LEVEL OF GROWTH WHERE IT'S COMPETITIVE WITH BUENO Y. AND NOT MUCH ELSE
BUT ALMOST EVERY LARGE QUOTED COMPANY CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE SPOKEN OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN STAYING IN EUROPE WHAT DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALL THE EGGS ARE CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF LARGE BRITISH COMPANIES AND LARGE COMPANIES ARE BENEFITING FROM BEING IN THE KNOW QUESTION REGULATIONS FAVOUR LARGE COMPANIES COS THEY CAN AFFORD THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THOSE REGULATIONS MORE COMPANIES CAN'T
YOU'VE SAID IN THE PAST JOHN THAT YOU THINK CITY OF LONDON WHICH ACTUALLY FEARS BRICKS AT QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY AT WORRIES ABOUT YOU LOSING YOUR TRADING BECKONED TO GERMANY OR FRANCE YOU THINK THE CITY OF LONDON WOULD ACTUALLY BE COMPLETELY FINE OUTSIDE OF EUROPE THAT'S OVERDOING IT I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE COMPLETELY FINE THERE ARE CLEARLY ISSUES A LOT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU COME OUT OF EUROPE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO
IF YOU COME OUT VERY ACRIMONIOUSLY THEN THE ECONOMY AND THE SETTEE COULD ACTUALLY BE HURT QUITE BADLY THAT MUST BE FAIR IF WE COME OUT WITH A SENSIBLE CERTAIN NEGOTIATIONS THEN YOU COULD END UP WITH LONDON HAPPILY IN THEIR POSSESSION
OF HAVING LESSON MORE SENSIBLE REGULATION AND FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE REST OF EUROPE AND LONDON THRIVE IT WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE SETTEE THAT'S VERY OFTEN NOW IT'S WORKED ANYWAY EURGH BHANDARI HUGE DRIVER FOR THE CITY AND THEY WERE THE RESULT OF EXCESS REGULATION IN EUROPE AND ON THE STAGE
SO ACTUALLY YOU THINK PERHAPS AFTER AN INITIAL SHOCK YOU COULD SEE A NEW FLOURISHING A NEW BIG BANG YEAH ABSOLUTELY YOU COULD AND YOU COULD SEE THE SAYING THE SAME THING IN OTHER INDUSTRIES WERE REGULATION IS REDUCED OR NEW REGULATIONS AND PARDON IN THE U.K. GRADUALLY MOVES AHEAD FOR HAVING A MORE SENSIBLE REGIME THE ONE IMPOSED A CRUSHER OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT CLEARLY DOESN'T
JOHN YESTERDAY WE HAD GEORGE SOROS THE MAN WHO FAMOUSLY BROKE THE POUND BACK ON BLACK WEDNESDAY THE WARNING THAT THE POUND CAN FALL BY UP TO TWENTY PER CENT
SHOULD SMALL COMPANIES FEAR A COLLAPSE IN STERLING IF IF WE HAD TO LEAVE THE PATH I HESITATE TO GO AGAINST HIS VIEWS ON CURRENTLY AS YOU'VE MADE A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF IT HE'S PROBABLY GOT A POSITION IN THE CURRENTLY AT THE MOMENT
IT'S PAM GOES DOWN A BIT IT'LL MAKE EXPORTING EASIER FOR COMPANIES THAT DO EXPORT THIS IS GOOD NEWS IF THERE IS A TWO OR THREE PER CENT TARIFF BARRIER PUT UP TWO OR THREE PER CENT OFF STERLING SOLVES THAT PROBLEM WHEN WONGA I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING TO BE TERRIFIED OF I DON'T BELIEVE FOR TWENTY PER CENT
ANNE'S ALREADY WEAK AND QUITE A LOT IN TERMS OF PURCHASING POWER CURRENTLY STAND TO END UP THE POUND IS ALREADY UNDERVALUED YOU'RE GOING INTO EUROPE NOW EUROPE WILL FEEL EXPENSIVE AND TWENTY PER CENT MORE OFF IN A FEEL HIDEOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND WE'D BE SHOVELLING GOODS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CHEAP PRICES AND VOLUMES WE HAVEN'T DONE FOR DECADES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JON MOULTON A BIT OF CAPITAL SO JOIN ME TO DISCUSS ALL THE NEWS IN THE MARKETS IS DAVID STUBBS GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST J.P. MORGAN ASSET MENTIONED DAVID THESE ARE RINGING UNUSUAL DAYS THE MARKETS WE HAD A WEAKENING POUND LAST WEEK AND THEN YESTERDAY THE POUND HAD ITS BEST DAY AND OVER EIGHT YEARS JUMPING TWO AND A HALF PER CENT AGAINST A DONALD WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON WELL CERTAINLY I THINK THIS IS THIS IS MARK HE'S TRYING TO PRICE THE PROBABILITY OF BRECHT'S IT ALL REMAIN REMAIN VOTE
THEY ARE HOSTAGE TO THE THE NEXT OR OPPOSE US AS WE ALL ARE AND THIS IS GOING TO BE REPLICATED AND IN THE COMING DAYS AND TELLS VOLATILITY BEFORE EVERYONE GETS THEIR WROTE THIS VOLATILITY REALLY IS ALL ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST BRICKS THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS GOING ON THE MARKETS WHICH INVESTORS ARE TRYING TO PRICE
ONE PRETTY BLUNT INSTRUMENT THAT IS THE NATURE OF MARKETS AND DISCUSSING LIKE THIS OBVIOUSLY MARKETS ARE AN IMPERFECT DEVICE FOR FOR TRYING TO FIND THE PRICE OF SOMETHING THEY ARE THEY MAY BE THE BEST OF THE VICE IF YOU GET EVERYONE TOGETHER A DIFFERENT VIEWS AND YET CREATE A MARKET IN THAT WAY BUT IT IS PRONE TO CHANGES IN A MOTION TO CHANGE WITH SENTIMENT AND EVERYONE HAS IN PERFECT INFORMATION NO ONE KNOWS EVERYTHING THEY SHOULD MAKE THAT DECISION PEOPLE WAIT
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE DEPENDING ON THEIR OWN BIASES THEIR OWN BELIEFS AND THAT'S WHY YOU GET DIFFERENT VIEWS OF PRICE THAT'S WHAT CREATES A MARKET IN ITSELF BUT IT ALSO CREATES WILD SWINGS WHEN THE FAX THAT TO CHANGE
ONE THING THAT PUZZLED ME BECAUSE IN THESE TIMES OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED IF YOU INVEST IN IT IS STILL WOOD TURNING FOUR PER CENT WHY AREN'T MORE PEOPLE PILING INTO EQUITY I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS FOCUSED ON THIS BUT AT THE MOMENT A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS ARE SITTING ON THEIR HANDS WHERE THEY WANT TO MAKE SOME KIND OF ASSET ALLOCATION SHIFT FOR WHATEVER REASON AND JUST DECIDING TO TAKE A DECISION HERE WANTS THE REFERENDUM IS HE'S OUT OF THE WAY CERTAINLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET AND WE THINK THAT YOU WOULD COME WHATEVER
MEASURE WHATEVER ACTION WE GET A REFERENDUM MAYBE NEXT WEEK IT WILL LOOK GOOD EITHER THINGS ON SALE BECAUSE THINGS THAT MARKET'S GONE DOWN OR ALTHOUGH THE UNCERTAINTY WILL BE LIFTED BUT AT THE MARKET LOOKS O.K.

WHILE IN THE Y. YOU NORMAN SMITH MASAI SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR AND IS ON THE LINE AND THE POINT BEING THEN THAT THE CLAIM THAT MISTER CAMERON MADE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE ELECTION THAT HE WAS KEEPING TO THESE TARGETS THAT HE MUST HAVE KNOWN AT THE TIME THAT THAT CLAIM WAS WAS FALSE
IT'S THAT AND ALSO THE BROADER ASSERTION THAT THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF GETTING NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS ANY TIME SO LONG AS WE REMAIN PART OF THE E.U. AND AS YOU SAY MISTER HILTON CLAIMS MY CAMERA WAS TOLD AS MUCH BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE HAD A STOCKTAKING MEETING TID ASSESS HOW THIS POLICY WAS GOING AND OFFICIALS APPARENTLY
TOLD MISTER CAMERON QUOTE DIRECTLY AND EXPLICITLY THAT IT WOULD PROVE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS WE WERE PART OF THAT YOU AND MISTER HILTON SAYS THAT WHEN MISTER CAMERON PUT IT IN ITS TWENTY FIFTEEN MANIFESTO HE ASSUMED HE'D PUT IT IN THE MANIFESTO BECAUSE HE WAS CONFIDENT HE'D GET A DEAL FROM THE OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES RESTRICTING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ALL MY CAMERON PLAN TO CAMPAIGN TO PULL OUT OF THE E.U. NEITHER OF WHICH OF COURSE HAVE COME TO PASS
MISTER HILTON SAYS THAT EAR OF IMMIGRATION CARRIES ON AS IT IS IT IS LEADING TO QUOTE A SOCIAL DISASTER IT IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE DECENCY AND TOLERANCE OF BRITISH PEOPLE WHO SEE THEIR PUBLIC SERVICES OVERWHELMED AND HE SUGGESTS THAT AN INSULAR
ELITE IS IN DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THEIR NEIGHBOURHOODS AFFECTED NUMBER TEN SAY QUITE SIMPLY THEY DO NOT RECOGNISE MISTER HILTON'S ACCOUNT OF EVENTS I MEAN MORE BROADLY DID IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT
KAREN ALMOST NOW DOESN'T EVEN DEFEND THE TENS OF THOUSANDS TARGET INDEED DOESN'T EVEN REFER TO IT AS A TARGET ANY MORE IT'S IT'S AN AMBITION WITH NO TIMETABLE MY MY CAMERA'S CHALLENGED ABOUT IT HE TENDS INSTEAD TO EXTOL THE ADVANTAGES ARE BRITISH CITIZENS BEING ABLE TO GO ELSEWHERE IN THE E.U. THE BENEFITS OF HAVING YOU MIGRANTS WORKING IN THE N.H.S. HE POINTS TO HIS BENEFIT CURVES BUT EVEN UNDER THE TREASURE HIS OWN ANALYSIS WE KNOW NET MIGRATION IS PROJECTED TO KEEP ON GOING UP BY WELL ABOVE
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RIGHT UP TO TWENTY THIRTY AND PRIVATELY WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THEIR REMAIN CAMPAIGN THE PRETTY OPEN ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE SORT OF HONEST ASSESSMENT IS THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF GETTING SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN NET MIGRATION UNTIL AND UNLESS THE ECONOMY AS IN THE REST OF EUROPE BEGIN TO REVIVE AND IS NO LONGER THIS PUNK BACK TO THE U.K. STEVE HOME FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL GEORGE SAW US FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN
THE MAN WHO BASICALLY MADE A BUCKET LOAD OUT OF BLACK WEDNESDAY WARNING THAT MANY LIKE HIM WILL MAKE AN EVEN BIGGER BUCKET LOAD THIS FRIDAY ON BLACK FRIDAY HE SAYS IF WE VOTE FOR BRECHT SAID HE IS PREDICTING A CALAMITOUS COLLAPSE IN THE POUND OF MORE THAN HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE BOOTED OUT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM HE SUGGESTS IT COULD BE UP TO TWENTY PER CENT
IT'LL BE MUCH WORSE IT HIT PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FINANCES UNDER REASONS IT WILL BE MUCH WORSE IS THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT MORE PEOPLE LIKE HIM AROUND BIG POWERFUL INVESTORS READY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS HUGE COLLAPSE IN STIRLING AND SUGGESTS THE REMEDIAL MEASURES AVAILABLE ARE NOW MUCH DIMINISHED BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY GOT A BASEMENT INTEREST RATES FOR THERE'S NO PROSPECTS BE ABLE TO KICK START THE ECONOMY AND HE SAYS WE ARE MUCH MORE
DEPENDENT ON INWARD CAPITAL WHEN WHAT WE WILL SEE IS A FLIGHT OF CAPITAL NONE THANK YOU WERE TALKING TO MICHAEL GO TEN PAST EIGHT NICK CLEGG AS WELL
TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN IT IS RUSSIA'S LAST CHANCE TO TAKE PART IN THIS SUMMER'S OLYMPICS THE I.O.C. THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS HOLDING A SUMMIT IN TODAY TO DISCUSS WHETHER THE COUNTRY'S TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETES SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE DESPITE THAT BAN ON THEM BY THE WORLD ATHLETICS BODY THE EYE DOUBLE A. F. JOIN IS ON THE LINE FROM THOSE AND IN SWITZERLAND DAVID IS THERE ANY REASON DAVID TO BELIEVE THAT THE I.O.C. THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE WILL OVERTURN THIS BAN
NO I DON'T THINK SO NICK BECAUSE ON FRIDAY THE I DOUBLE A. F. WERE VERY FORTHRIGHT IN THEIR DECISION TO BAN RUSSIAN ATHLETES OR
HOLD THE BAN ON RUSSIAN ATHLETES FROM RIO AND ON SATURDAY WE RECEIVED A STATEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SUPPORTING THE I DOUBLE A. F. SO THERE'D BE A BIG SHOCK TODAY IF THEY PERFORMED A U. TURN ON THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RUBBER STAMP THAT REALLY VERY HISTORIC DECISION THAT COULD SEE
HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE WORLD OF SPORTS AND AN OLYMPIC GAMES WITHOUT A RUSSIAN ATHLETICS TEAM THE WON SO MANY MEDALS ONLY SECOND IN THE MEDAL TABLE BEHIND THE AMERICANS AT LONDON TWENTY TWELVE ATHLETICS TRACK AND FIELD CONTRIBUTED FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF RUSSIA'S TOTAL MEDALS AT LONDON TWENTY TWELVE SO THIS IS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT BUT THE R. O. C.
IF THEY WANT TO GET TOUGH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DOPING THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS AND WILL THE IDEA THAT SOME ATHLETES ARE FEW THAT CAN PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE COLLEEN CAN COMPETE BUT UNDER A NEUTRAL FLAG IS THAT GOING TO BE PURSUED TODAY
THAT'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSED YEAH THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE GUIDELINES REALLY FOR ALLOWING A SMALL NUMBER OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES WHO LIVE AND UNDERGO RIGOUROUS DRUG TESTING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY TO COMPETE IN RIO UNDER A NEUTRAL FLAG NOW SOME RUSSIAN ATHLETES WHO HAVE ALREADY AND COACHING STAFF HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY COULDN'T DO THIS IT'S BETRAYING THEIR COUNTRY
AND IT'S ONLY REALLY EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE TO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF ATHLETES IT'S REALLY JUST A CHINK OF LIGHT REALLY AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THIS DOPING IS
FAIRLY ROBUST BY THE LOOKS OF IT HOWEVER THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES APPEALING TO THE COURT OF ARBITRATION FOR SPORT AND THE PRESIDENT OF CASK WILL BE AT THIS MEETING IN LAUSANNE TODAY JOHN COATES HE'S ALSO AN I O. SEE DEPUTY PRESIDENT
SO THE BIG HITTERS HERE TODAY IS REALLY GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DAY HOWEVER WAIT AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT COMES OF IT IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS DAVID IN A ELIZA THANK YOU
THE TIME TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE DOCTORS' UNION THE B.M.A. OPPOSES ASSISTANT ASSISTED DYING BUT THAT MIGHT BE ABOUT TO CHANGE AND BRIMLESS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT THERE HAVING A CONFERENCE AND AND WHERE THEY WERE DISCUSSING A REAL CHANGE THAT THE B.M.A. COULD
TAKE OR JUST A CHANGE OF MOOD BEHIND THE SCENES WELL THERE COULD BE A REAL CHANGE THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR A SHIFT IN STANCE FROM ONE OF OPPOSITION TO ASSISTED DYING TO TO A NEUTRAL STANCE ON ASSISTED DYING AND THAT WOULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT STEP BY THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE GREAT ETHICAL DEBATE OF OUR TIMES AND
IT DIVIDES THE MEDICAL PROFESSION JUST AS IT DIVIDES WIDER SOCIETY AND THERE'S A SMALL BUT GROWING LIST OF PLACES WHERE ASSISTED DYING IS ALLOWED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM SWITZERLAND OF COURSE WHERE THE TICK LIST DIGNITAS CLINIC IS BASS PART OF THE UNITED STATES AND JUST LOST OUR LAST FEW DAYS CANADA HAS PASSED A BILL ON THIS BUT LAST YEAR BOTH TO WESTMINSTER AND HOLYROOD PARLIAMENTS
VOTED PRETTY EMPHATICALLY TO REJECT MOVES TO LEGALISE ASSISTED DYING IN A WAY THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING ISN'T IT THAT THAT IN SPITE OF THAT THERE IS A MOOD AMONG SOME DOCTORS THAT THEY SHOULD STILL BE CHANGING THEIR OWN POSITION I THINK THE THING HERE IS THAT DOCTORS ARE REALLY AT THE SHARP END OF THIS DILEMMA IT IS SEEN BY SOME AS A CHALLENGE OF THEIR THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF DO NO HARM WHILE OTHERS SEE IT AS A WAY TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING AND HELP PATIENTS TO A DIGNIFIED DEATH SO
I GET IT RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE OF DOCTORS SO IT'S NO SURPRISE IT'S A CONCERN IT JUST KEEPS COMING BACK IT'S BEEN DEBATED BY THE B.M.A. FOUR TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE OFFICIAL POSITION SWITCH TO ONE OF NEUTRALITY BUT IT CHANGE BACK TO OUTRIGHT OPPOSITION THE FOLLOWING YEAR IT'S REMAINED THAT WAY DESPITE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS TWO TO SHIFT THEIR STANCE
WE WILL BE HEARING FROM BOTH SIDES OR SELECTION OF VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME FOR THE TIME BEING ELLEN BRIMMER FACT IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS SOME OF FRANCE'S TOP COMPANIES HAVE TAKEN OUT ADVERTS IN THOSE PAPERS FAVOURING BRICKS IT IN THE TIMES THE TELEGRAPH IN THE SUN THEY APPEAL TO THEIR BRITISH FRIENDS TO PLAY AMI BRITANNIQUE
REMAIN HAD TO REMAIN IN FRENCH BUT ANYWAY AMONGST THEM AIR FRANCE THAN ONY AND ORANGE SAY WE LOVE YOU BUT WE'RE IN BUSINESS NOT JUST IN LOVE HOWEVER THE TIMES WHICH OF COURSE ACTUALLY BACKED STAYING IN SUGGEST THAT FRENCH VOTERS WILL SHED FEWEST EARS IF BRITAIN LEAVES IT REPORTS ONLY FORTY ONE PERCENT OF THE FRENCH IN AN E.U. WIDE SURVEY SO THEY WANTED BRITAIN TO REMAIN THE LOWEST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY
IT'S NOT JUST THE FRENCH MAKING TREATIES RICHARD BRANSON HAS TAKEN OUT FULL PAGE ADVERTS IN NEARLY EVERY NATIONAL PAPER HE SAYS BRITAIN IS BETTER OFF IN FOR PEACE PROSPERITY AND SECURITY AS THE DAILY EXPRESS CONTINUES WHAT IT CALLS ITS CRUSADE TO GET US OUT OF THE E.U. IT WARNS THAT BRITISH MEMBERSHIP COULD BE VERY BAD FOR PENSIONS QUOTING THE DIRECTOR OF THE PENSIONS INSTITUTE THE PAPER SUGGESTED AN E.U. DIRECTIVE COULD INCREASE THE COST OF PENSIONS ONE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WITH THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH SAYS
THERE REMAIN CAMP WINS THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT HANDS DOWN SUGGEST THAT PENSIONS COULD BE PUT AT RISK BY A BRECHT'S IT IT SAYS THERE ARE MAJOR CONCERNS A STOCK MARKET COULD HIT ROCKY TIMES CAUSING PENSION FUNDS TO DIFFERENT BACK THE SUN REPORTS FOR THE THREE GIRLS WHO FELL ILL IN SALFORD AFTER TAKING ECSTASY PILLS NICKNAME TEDDY TABLETS THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST SWEETS THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN SAYS HER DAUGHTER AGED ONLY HALF A BILL BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE
IN THE EYE A MOTHER WHOSE SON DIED AFTER TAKING ECSTASY CALLS ON PARENTS TO TALK TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT THE DRUG THE VIEWERS I COULD BY THE COLUMNIST GRACE DENT SPEECH YOUR TWELVE YEAR OLD SHE URGES IT'LL BE AWKWARD BUT IF YOU DON'T WHOEVER HAS THE TEDDIES
MIGHT THERE'S WORRY IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY ABOUT WHAT IT CALLS A HUGE SHORTFALL OF SAILORS ACCORDING TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IT BELIEVES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO TO SEA IN PART BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BEAR TO BE WITHOUT THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA MOST PARROT ON EMPLOYERS SUGGEST IT'S CRUCIAL TO START PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS ON SHIPS WALES'S SUCCESS AGAINST RUSSIAN YURI SIXTEEN IS CELEBRATED IN THE PAPERS WELSH WONDERS TAKE TOP PRIZE DECLARES THE DAILY STAR THE DAILY MAIL SAYS GARETH BALE DOES IT AGAIN CALLING HIM THE PRINCE OF WALES
A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WINGER IN ACTION TAKES UP MOST OF THE BACK PAGE OF THE EYE WITH THE HEADLINE WHALES SHOW ENGLAND HOW IT'S DONE THE MIRROR FEATURES A CARTOON OF THE RUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTER TELLING PRESIDENT PUTIN WE TRIED TO PROGRAMME THE MISSA COMRADE WE CAN'T SPELL ANY OF THE TOFF
THE MAIN HEADLINE AT SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IS THAT ONE OF DAVID CAMERON'S FORMER CLOSEST ADVISOR STEVE HILTON ARE SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WAS WARNED BY WHITEHALL OFFICIALS FOUR YEARS AGO THAT HIS TARGET OF REDUCING IMMIGRATION COULDN'T BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT LEAVING THE E.U.
M.P.S PAID TRIBUTE YESTERDAY TO JOE COX WHO WAS KILLED OF COURSE IN HER CONSTITUENCY IN WEST YORKSHIRE LAST THURSDAY PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS IN RECESS FOR THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WE WERE CALLED TO REMEMBER THE LABOUR M.P. HERE IS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE
PARLIAMENT IS USED TO GATHERING TO EXPRESS SORROW AND HORRIBLE AND TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN ACROSS THE WORLD BUT IT'S ONLY HUMAN TO FEEL IT MORE SHARP PLAYED WHEN THE LOSSES A FRIEND AND A COLLEAGUE WHO SAT NEXT TO YOU CHATTED WITH YOU MAYBE BOUGHT YOU COFFEE
AFTER HER MURDER LAST WEEK JOE COX'S USUAL SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR TWO ROSES ARE RED ONE FOR LABOUR AND A WHITE ONE FOR HER NATIVE YORKSHIRE APART FROM THAT SEAT M.P.S CRAMMED AND SILENCE INTO EVERY POSSIBLE SPACE TO HEAR TRIBUTES TO HER
UP IN THE GALLERY HER FAMILY INCLUDING HER TWO SMALL CHILDREN JUST THREE AND FIVE YEARS OLD LOOKED ON HERE FIRST AS HER FRIEND AND FELLOW LABOUR M.P. RITUAL REEVES WAS A CALL TO CARRY ON JOE COX'S WORK
THE COMBATS AND GUARD AGAINST HATRED INTOLERANCE AND INJUSTICE TO SERVE OTHERS WITH DIGNITY AND WITH LOVE AND THAT IS THE BEST WAY THAT WE CAN REMEMBER JOE AND ALL THAT SHE STOOD FOR
LAST LET ME SAY THIS BUT ME AND SPEND WILL GO ON TO ELECT A NEW M.P. BUT NO ONE REPLACE MUM
THE SESSION HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE SPEAKER JOHN BERKEL WHO LIKE NEARLY EVERY M.P. WAS WEARING A WHITE ROSE AN ATTACK LIKE THIS
STRIKE'S NOT ONLY AND INDEED
BUT AT OUR FREEDOM
THAT IS WHY WE ASSEMBLE HERE
BOTH TOP ON
AND TO DOUBLE OUR DEDICATION TO DEMOCRACY SOME M.P.S HAD PUT ARMS AROUND COLLEAGUES WHO WERE CLOSE FRIENDS OF JOE COX AND WERE CLEARLY UPSET LIBERAL LEADER JEREMY CORRIGAN GAVE HIS NEIGHBOUR LUCY PILE A COMFORTING SQUEEZE AS HE WAITED TO SPEAK
THE HORRIFIC ACT THAT TOOK HER FROM US WAS AN ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY
ON A WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SHOCKED AND SADDENED BY
BUT IN THE DAYS SINCE THE COUNTRY HAS ALSO LEARNT SOMETHING OF THE EXTRAORDINARY HUMANITY AND CAN
WHICH DROVE HER POLITICAL ACTIVISM AND BELIEFS
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE'D FIRST MET JILL COX TEN YEARS AGO IN DARFUR WHERE SHE WAS AN AID WORKER HELPING REFUGEES HE SAID MANY PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY OWED THEIR LIVES TO HER AND HER POLITICS WERE INSPIRED BY LOVE
JOE BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER SHE SAW THE BEST IN PEOPLE AND SHE BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN THEM A BRAVE ADVENTURER AND THE CLEAN TEAM CLIMBER SHE WAS NEVER DAUNTED
WHEN MOST PEOPLE HERE HAVE A PLACE CALLED THE INACCESSIBLE PINNACLE THEY LEAVE IT WELL ALONE
NOT JOE SHE DIDN'T JUST CLIMATE SHE ABSEILED DOWN IT AND DID SO DESPITE A BAD CASE OF MORNING SICKNESS
AND IT WAS A RESPECT IRREPRESSIBLE SPIRIT THAT HELP TO GIVE HER SUCH DETERMINATION AND FOCUS IN HER POLITICS TO THE LABOUR M.P. STEPHEN QANNICK WAS HER FRIEND FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND SHARED AN OFFICE WITH HER SO HIS MEMORIES WERE PERSONAL BUT HE DIDN'T SHY AWAY FROM POLITICS AND HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THE UKIP POSTER TITLED BREAKING POINT AND SHOWING A QUEUE OF MIGRANTS
MISTER SPEAKER I CAN ONLY IMAGINE JOE'S REACTION HAD SHE SEEN THE POSTER UNVEILED HOURS BEFORE HER DEATH HER POST ON THE STREETS OF BRITAIN THE DEMONISED HUNDREDS OF DESPERATE REFUGEES INCLUDING HUNGRY TERRIFIED CHILDREN FLEEING FROM THE TERROR OF ISIS AND FROM RUSSIAN BOMB
SHE WOULD HAVE RESPONDED WITH OUTRAGE AND WITH A ROBUST REJECTION OF THE CALCULATED NARRATIVE OF CYNICISM DIVISION AND DESPAIR THAT IT REPRESENTS CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS PAID THEIR TRIBUTES TO THE FORMER OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT SECRETARY ANDREW MITCHELL SAID SHE WAS LABOUR TO HER FINGERTIPS BUT THAT HADN'T STOPPED HER WORKING WITH HIM MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH A CRUSTY OLD TORY SH SHE AND I BECAME CO CHAIRS OF THE ALL PARTY FRIENDS OF SYRIA
AND SHE WAS BRAVE HER ENERGY AND EFFECTIVENESS WEREN'T INSPIRATION
AND FINALLY THIS FROM HER FRIENDS FIRST ALISON MCGOVERN AND THEN MARY CRAY
HALF HOLDING YOU UPRIGHT HALF SHOVING YOU FORWARD THAT WAS WHAT IT MEANT TO HAVE JOE'S AROUND YOUR SHOULDER AND HOW WE ALL LONG FOR THOSE ARMS AROUND A SHOULDER TODAY FOR ONE MORE HUG
AND DEFINITELY FOR ONE MORE SMILE BUT IT CANNOT BE IT WAS A BLESSING TO HAVE KNOWN JOE
REST IN PEACE
AND BEFORE FILING OUT OF THE CHAMBER TO ATTEND A SERVICE IN SAINT MARGARET'S CHURCH OPPOSITE M.P.S ALL STOOD AND BEGAN TO APPLAUD USUALLY AGAINST COMMONS RULES HAS A FINAL TRIBUTE TO JILL COX M.P. AND MOTHER AND THAT WAS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HUMOUR MORE FROM HER I THINK THIRTY ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO AS WELL TIME NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
YOU WAIT AND WAIT FOR A TRAIN STRIKE AND THEN ALONG COME TO I WANT THE FIRST HITTING COMEDIAN LINES IN LONDON AS WE WERE HEARING ALL GETTING INTO LONDON AT LEAST THE SECOND HEATING SCOTT RAIL SERVICES INTO EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW INDEED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY COLIN BLAINE EN SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT JOINS US FROM OUTSIDE QUEEN STREET STATION IN GLASGOW MORNING COLIN HOW MUCH DISRUPTION ARE WE EXPECTING THIS MORNING
WELL I THINK THERE WILL BE DISRUPTION IT'S GOING TO BE NOT EXTENSIVE BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COMMUTERS WILL NOT I'M AT QUEEN STREET STATION THE GLASGOW END OF SCOTLAND'S BUSIEST COMMUTER ROUTES ACROSS THE CENTRAL BELT TO EDINBURGH AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN A DIFFICULT SUMMER FOR REAL PASSENGERS HERE BECAUSE OF MAJOR ENGINEERING WORKS TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE NO MORE DISRUPTION BECAUSE OF THIS DISPUTE WITH THE R.M.T. OVER DRIVERS OPERATING THE TRAIN DOORS INSTEAD OF GUARDS I'M JOINED BY ROB SHORT HOSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF SCOTT
THE UNION SAYS IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE WITH A HOST OF PROBLEMS IN SCOTLAND THEY SAY WHAT THEY CALLED DRIVER ONLY TRAINS ARE ALREADY IN SERVICE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
GOOD MORNING CORN AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THERE'S TWO THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE ABOUT THAT THE FIRST THING IS
YOU'D HAVE SCORED FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL BY TRAIN DO SOMEONE A SERVICE
THE DOORS ARE SAFELY OPENED BY THE DRIVER AND THERE'S A SECOND MEMBER OF STAFF ON BOARD TO DO WITH YOUR CUSTOMER SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
SO THAT'S THE SORT OF SUMMER'S BEEN WORKING HERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THE SECOND THING IS THE REAL WAY IS HEAVILY REGULATED AND WHISTLE FOR SAFETY
AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT I'LL BE AT THE OFFICE OF AND REAL AND THIS IS AS RECENT AS YESTERDAY THEY WERE SAYING THAT THIS METHOD OF OPERATION OF THE DOORS AT ALL BY THE DRIVER AND LIKE A MEMBER OF STAFF ON BOARD AS A SAFE WE HAVE WORK IN SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS BEEN SAID AND ABOUT SAFETY BUT WE PREFER TO DEAL WITH THE FACTS BUT THERE IS A PARALLEL DISPUTE GOING ON WITH SOUTHERN DRINKS DOESN'T HE
TO BELIEVE ALL THE PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THIS THAT UNIONS COMPLAINED MOST OF SUBSTANCE WITH US THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S ACTION BUT ON IN OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. BUT WE'RE REALLY DEFINITELY OFF AND SCOTT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WOULD NOT MEET ANY FORM PROPOSALS TO THE UNIONS ALWAYS SAID AS WE WANT
SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW THERE'S ALL THE INVESTMENT THAT'S GOING ON ALL THE MODERNISATION OF SCHOOLBOY TRAINS OF OUR TRACKS OF A STATIONS WHO DO WE KEEP PIECE OUT OF THE WAY THAT WE SERVE THE CUSTOMERS KEEP PACE WITH THAT
SO WE'VE ALREADY SAID TO THE UNIONS REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE GO WITH ALL THOSE IDEAS WE COULD SIT DOWN AND TALK WILL GUARANTEE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND JOBS SO I THINK WE ARE A DIFFERENT SITUATION GIVEN SCOTT BRIEFLY IF YOU COULD TELL US WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE STRAIGHTS LIKE WERE TO BE HERE IN SCOTLAND YELLOW IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
DISRUPTED BY THAT ARE EMPTY ACTION TODAY BUT WITH THE RAILWAYS FOR BUSINESS WILL BE RUN THERE BUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF SERVICES AND THAT ALL THOSE THE CARRIER BUT SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF A NORMAL PERSON ON IT WE'RE UP FOR A BUSINESS PARTNER WHO IS UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE ARE WHEN IT FITS ABOUT DISRUPTION SO DIFFICULT THE FOR REAL COMMUTERS THAT SCOTLAND AND INDEED OVER THE BORDER
IN PLACES AS WELL IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED THERE'S LARGE POTS AS PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND IN HER OWN CHOIR SCHOOL ROCK WE ALREADY OPERATE THE SYSTEM THE THE DOORS ARE OPEN BY THE DRIVER WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER OF STAFF ON BOARD HAS BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR OR SO THEY WOULD BE AFFECTED BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL
SOME OF THE LONGER VERSUS SUSPECTS THEY ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED THAN YOU WOULD IN EVER MECHANICALLY PEOPLE MOVING WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP HOW DO WE REACH A POINT WHERE THE DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED WE WANT TO WE WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION WE WANT TO SET DOWN AND WE WANT TO DISCUSS IDEAS WITH THE UNIONS
WHAT WHAT YOU SAID AS WE CAN'T DO THAT WITH A BIT OF STRENGTH HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD YOU'RE LAST WEEK WE WERE IN WITH THE CAST
ON WEDNESDAY AND THE NIGHT BEFORE THE NIGHT BEFORE WE WERE DUE TO SET DOWN THE AISLE SEVEN STRAIGHT THIS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE DAY THAT'S NO WAY TO CARRY OVER NEGOTIATION WE WANT TO GET STRAIGHT CALLED OFF
TO TABLE LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THEIR WAS ROB SHOT THOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
COLIN BLAME THANK YOU IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN SHOULD TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE CANCER CHANGE A STUDY IN THE LANCET ONCOLOGY JOURNAL SUGGESTS VERY MUCH THAT IT SHOULD PROFESSOR DAVID THAT HIS HAIR WAS PROFESSOR OF YOUR LOGICAL ONCOLOGY AT THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH IN THE ROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL AS WELL AND CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT GOOD MORNING TO YOU THE MONEY AND YOUR SUGGESTION IS THAT WE ARE GETTING IT WRONG WITH RADIOTHERAPY
I THINK I'D CHANGE THAT SLIGHTLY I THINK WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND WE'RE GOING TO GET IT AND I WAS LIKE IN THE PICTURE BUT IT AIN'T IT'S ABOUT DOSAGE IN THE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE RADIOTHERAPY HAPPENED YES IT IS THERE'S BEEN VERY SOUND BIOLOGICAL REASON TO THINK THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE A READY THERAPY TREATMENTS AND PROSTATE CANCER HAS A SHORTER COURSE OF TREATMENT GIVING A BIGGER DOSE BUT A SMALLER NUMBER OF OVERALL DOSES AND OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE TEAM EFFORT
PATIENTS DOCTORS NURSES RADIOGRAPHERS AND PHYSICIST WHO DESIGN TREATMENT TO TEST THIS AND THOSE RESULTS WERE VERY PLEASED TO BE THEY'VE JUST BEEN REPORTED AND WHAT THOSE RESULTS HAVE SHOWN IS FIRSTLY THAT OVERALL WITH RADIOTHERAPY THE OUTCOME FOR MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER IS VERY GOOD NINE OUT OF TEN ARE FREE OF DISEASE FIVE YEARS OUT OF THERE
A TREATMENT AND SECONDLY THAT USING THE MODERN TECHNIQUES OF RADIOTHERAPY WHAT WE CALL INTENSITY MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY THAT WE INTRODUCED DURING THE STUDY ACTUALLY ABOUT HALVED AT THE SIDE EFFECTS OF RADIOTHERAPY SO THESE ARE REALLY AT A NOW AT A VERY LOW LEVEL GENERALLY SO THAT'S BEEN A BIG PLUS FOR ALL OF THE PATIENTS IN THE TRIAL BUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE
IS TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN GIVE AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT IN TWENTY TREATMENT RATHER THAN THIRTY SEVEN SO YOU SAVE SEVENTEEN TREATMENTS PER PATIENT IT'S ABOUT HALF THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT SO THAT MEANS THE PATIENTS HAVE TO COME TO HOSPITAL
ON FEWER OCCASIONS IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR PATIENT THROUGHPUT MUCH QUICKER THROUGH YOUR DEPARTMENT SO YOU ACTUALLY SAVE THAT RESOURCE WHICH MEANS YOU CAN GIVE BETTER QUALITY RADIOTHERAPY SO IT'S A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYBODY WHILE WE'RE NOT ALREADY BEEN DOING IT
RADIOTHERAPY HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST CENTURY TO BE SAFE AND GENERALLY SPEAKING WE USE SMALL DOSES OF RADIOTHERAPY BECAUSE THE BODY TOLERATES THEM BETTER WE CAN USE LARGER DOSES IF YOU REDUCE THE TOTAL DOSE OF RADIOTHERAPY OR GIVE A LITTLE BUT THAT BALANCE BETWEEN GETTING EFFECTIVENESS
AND LACK OF SIDE EFFECTS IS THE KEY AND THAT HE HAS HELPED AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE WE COULD DO NOW THAT POSSIBLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO I DON'T KNOW TEN YEARS AGO AND I THINK THE BETTER READY THERAPY TECHNIQUES MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE HERE AND IT MIGHT BE THAT ACTUALLY IF WE DONE IT TEN YEARS AGO WITHOUT THE NEW TECHNIQUES THAT WOULD HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH LIGHTER AND I COULDN'T WORK FOR OTHER CANCERS IT COULD WE WE KNOW THAT IT CERTAINLY IS USEFUL IN BREAST CANCER
WE'RE NOT SURE YET ABOUT OTHER CANCERS AND IT MAY BE THAT THERE'S THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT SORTS OF CANCERS SO MANY OTHER CANCERS MAY NEED THE LONGER COURSE OF TREATMENT BUT INTERESTING AND POTENTIALLY WELL FOR INDIVIDUALS PLAINLY BUT ALSO FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE MORE GENERALLY IF IT IF IF YOUR FINDINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER WERE APPLICABLE MORE WIDELY THEY'RE QUITE A BIG CHEQUE IT WOULD AN EVENING PROSTATE CANCER WE TREAT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND
IT'S THE COMMONEST TREATMENT FOR CURING PROSTATE CANCER IN THE U.K. AND IT'S ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE WORKLOAD OF RADIOTHERAPY DEPARTMENT SO THIS ACTUALLY HAS A BIG OVERALL IMPACT ON HOW WE CAN DELIVER THE RADIOTHERAPY SERVICE NATIONALLY PROFESSOR DAVID THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN STABBED AND ELSA'S HERE WITH THE WEATHER STUFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING TUBE TODAY'S ACTUALLY FINE AND DRY FOR MANY SOME WARM SUNSHINE AROUND BUT IT WILL BECOME
FAIRLY CLOUDY AS WE HEAD ON IN TOWARDS THE AFTERNOON BUT AT LEAST MAY PLACES STAYING DRY FOR ENGLAND AND IT'S A DRY FAIRLY MILD START PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST A FEW CHILLI SPOTS IN THE MIDLANDS WHERE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF MIST AND FOG AROUND THERE SOME VARIABLE CLOUD THIS MORNING BUT ALSO SOME SUNSHINE AGAIN THE BEST OF IT IN THE MIDLANDS NOT THROUGH THE DAY THE SKIES WILL TEND TO CLOUD OVER CONSIDERABLY WITH SUNNY SPELLS HERE AND THERE BUT MOST PLACES WILL SHE SHOULD REMAIN DRY HAD TO FEEL QUITE WARM HAVE HIGHS RANGE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO CELSIUS IN THE WARMEST SPOT
FOR WALES AS A FEW CHILLI SPOTS ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN AREAS WHERE SKIES CLEARED OVERNIGHT HERE THERE'S SOME MORNING SUNSHINE HOWEVER MUCH OF WALES HAVE A PRETTY CLOUDY START THAT CLOUD WILL THIN AND BREAK IN PLACES SET THROUGH THE DAY SO HAVE SOME SUNNY SPELLS TO DEVELOP THEIR WESTERN AND SOUTHERN AREAS MAY HOLD ONTO THE CLOUD ALL DAY TEMPERATURES REACHING SEVENTEEN TO MAYBE NINETEEN CELSIUS IN THE WARMEST SPOTS

SANFORD WENT TO A SHOOTING RANGED ALSO BEFORE THE RALLY TO LEARN HOW TO FIRE A GUN AND TOLD POLICE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER FIRED A WEAPON HOW SHOCKED AND SURPRISED A PEOPLE THAT THIS WAS NOT SOME APPARENTLY SPONTANEOUS ACTS BUT WAS A PROPER PLAN TO ASSASSINATE THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE
THIS YOU SAID MICK THERE'S BEEN A RUMP A HOLLOW TRUNK WHEREVER HE'S GONE THERE HAVE BEEN PROTESTS HAD MANY AS HIS RALLIES AND EVENTS SO IN SOME WAYS THE PHYSICAL CONFRONTATION ASPECT IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING BUT THE FACT THAT SOMEONE
AND SO LONG AGO TO ASSASSINATE MISTER TRUMP AND WANTED TO GO THROUGH WITH IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING NOBODY IS SEEMING WE TRIED TO DO THAT SO FAR IS COURT APPOINTED BARRISTER ONE IN SANDFORD REMANDED TO A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SAW THESE SHE SAID THAT SANDFORD HAD AUTISM

THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WITH TWO DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE E.U. REFERENDUM DAVID CAMERON'S IMMIGRATION POLICY HAS BEEN ATTACKED BY THE MAN WHO WAS ONCE A VERY CLOSE FRIEND AS WELL AS AN ADVISOR STEVE HILTON SAYS MUST KAREN WAS TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO BY HIS OWN OFFICIALS THAT CUTTING NET MIGRATION TO THE TARGET OF UNDER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHY WE WERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BE MOTHER FINANCIAL MARKETS PLAINLY THINK SOMETHING'S HAPPENING IN THE
HE REFERENCES REFERENDUM DEBATE AND THE POLLING THEIR BELIEF THAT THE REMAIN CAMP IS NOW DOING BETTER IN THE HOURS BEFORE THE VOTE HAD LED TO A BIG SURGE OF BUYING YESTERDAY SHARES UP THREE PER CENT THE POUND MAKING ITS BIGGEST ONE DAY AGAIN IN SEVEN YEARS AND JUST IN CASE WE DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE THE BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR GEORGE SOROS THE MAN WHO BET AGAINST THEM
NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND ONE HE SAYS HE THINKS COULD FALL BY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT IF WE LEFT THE E. ULUS DISCUSS ALL OF THIS WITH NICK CLEGG FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND I REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND FIRST OF ALL STEVE HILTON'S ALLEGATION YES YOU HAVE A DIP DID THE PRIME MINISTER NO WHO DURING THE COURSE OF THE TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN GOVERNMENT DID HE NO WAS HE TOLD THAT NET BY AGGRESSION THAT NET MIGRATION TARGET WAS UNATTAINABLE
LISTEN IT WASN'T EVEN A GOVERNMENT TARGET IT WAS AN INTERNAL CONSERVATIVE DEBATE IT'S REMARKABLE SAY CONSERVATIVE STEVE HILTON YET LONER BUT THOUGHT FORMALLY A GOOD FRIEND OF DAVID CAMERON NOW CRITICISING HIM FOR A TARGET WHICH THE CONSERVATIVES EN MASSE ESPOUSED AND WHAT I FIND I MEAN OF ALL THE FIBS ARE NONSENSE I'VE HEARD DURING THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN TO HEAR LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS TRYING TO BE SORT OF HOLIER THAN THOU ABOUT IMMIGRATION TARGETS WHEN THEY THEMSELVES
ARE NOW IN MY VIEW COMMITTING THE BIGGEST CON OF ALL TELLING MILLIONS OF VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY WILL DRAMATICALLY CUT IMMIGRATION WHEN THEY HAVE WHEN CAN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN THEY HAVE NO PLAN TO DO SO WHATSOEVER DID HE NO
BUT THIS WAS UNATTAINABLE WAS HE TOLD BY OFFICIALS WERE YOU THERE DID YOU NO I WAS NOT ALLOWED WE'VE GOT APPS RECOLLECTION OF THAT AT ALL AS IT AS IT BY THE WAY WHAT THE REASON IT WASN'T A GOVERNMENT TARGET WAS I DISAGREE IT'S A MATTER OF RECORD WITH THE CONSERVATIVE POLICY SHALL I TELL YOU WHY NOT BECAUSE WE WERE MEMBER OR NOT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE I THINK EH NET IMMIGRATION TARGET RELIES JUST AS MUCH OVER SOMETHING YOU CAN'T CONTROL NAMELY PEOPLE LEAVING AS PEOPLE COMING IN THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE THE AS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
THE PRECISE DISAGREEMENT BUT WHAT IS REALLY I THINK SUCH A DISSERVICE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS BETWEEN NOW AND AND THURSDAY IS THOSE WHO MIGHT BE SEDUCED INTO FOLLOWING WHAT MICHAEL GO FOR NIGEL FOR ARJUN BORIS JOHNSON SAY ABOUT IMMIGRATION WILL FIND THEMSELVES I THINK SORLEY LET DOWN I THINK I FEEL VERY ANGRY WHEN THEY DISCOVER THAT THE LEAF CAMPAIGNERS HAVE NO PLAN
AT ALL TO BRING IMMIGRATION DOWN IT ANY MEANINGFUL WAY IF WE WERE TO LEAVE WHAT IS THE BIGGEST YES BUT THAT'S NOT WHY THE SAME WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WE WERE NO THEY'RE SAYING WE WILL CONTROL IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THEY'RE NOT SAYING NECESSARILY SOME WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MUCH LOWER SOME WOULDN'T THEY'RE SAYING WE WOULD CONTROL AND THAT IS SIMPLY A FACT NO IT'S NOT IT WAS ONLY FIVE A NOT IN A CHARGE AND AT THE MOMENT IT IS EQUALLY FACT
WE'RE NOT IN CHARGE NO THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG THEY CANNOT EVEN AGREE AMONGST THEMSELVES BUT CHALLENGE THEM NOT ME THAT WOULD BE A LETTER FOR GOVERNMENTS TO CONTROL LET ME FINISH A SENTENCE THEY CAN'T EVEN AGREE AMONGST THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT A NEW LAND BORDER IN ISLAND OR NOT BY THE WAY IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THAT OF COURSE YOU JUST LEAVE THE BACK DOOR OPEN HAVING LOCKED THE FRONT DOOR WHAT'S THE POINT OF
CLAIMING IT WOULD CONTROL BORDERS WHEN WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO DO SO IF WE WERE GOING TO DO SO AN ISLAND IT WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE ON THE ON THE PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THEY EMULATE COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA WHICH HAVE MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF NET IN AND OUT OF IMMIGRATION THAN WE DID IN FACT OR TELLING PEOPLE THAT WE JUST CAN DO NOTHING AND WHAT PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY ONE DONE IS SOME SENSE OF THEM BEING IN SURE AGAIN WHAT'S FASCINATING ABOUT YOUR POSITION THIS MORNING IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING
STAY IN STAY OUT WE ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF OUR OWN IMMIGRATION OUR OWN CONTROL ABOUT WHO COMES OVER YOUR FRIEND YOU'RE PUTTING WORDS INTO MY MOUTH I HAVEN'T SAID THAT WHAT I'VE GOT ICE WHAT I WILL SAY ABOUT IMMIGRATION HAITIAN ISN'T ABSOLUTELY NOT MY VIEW IS FIRSTLY WE JUST HAVE TO BE CANDID WITH PEOPLE THAT THE LARGE SCALE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ACROSS LARGE DISTANCES WHETHER THEY'RE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS OR REFUGEES IS A FACT OF INTERNATIONAL LIFE WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE UPSIDES AND THE CHALLENGES AND THE DILEMMAS WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NOT
EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY WHICH IS LAUDED BY LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS NORWAY ICELAND SWITZERLAND CANADA AUSTRALIA UNITED STATES EVERY SINK YOUR THEY WILL HAVE IN COMMON THEY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF IMMIGRATION PER HEAD OF POPULATION THAN WE DO SO IT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE ALL SHARE ACROSS THERE WELL THAT'S THE FIRST POINT SECOND YOUR COURSE THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF IMMIGRATION AT THE MOMENT FROM COUNTRIES
OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION IF WE CHOSE TO DO SO AS A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY WE COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THAT IF WE WANTED TO OF COURSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH WE SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE UNDER PRESSURE UNDER CERTAIN AREAS YES OF COURSE YOU MUST IMPLEMENT THE REFORMS WHICH MEAN THAT PEOPLE CAN'T ACCESS BENEFITS WHEN THEY COME INTO THIS COUNTRY ON THE FIRST DAY THEY ARRIVE NO QUESTIONS ASKED SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS I CAN DO BUT WE SHOULD NOT DO AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY IT ANGERS ME ACTUALLY IS THE FALSE PROSPECTUS AT THE LEAF CAMPAIGNERS
GIVING TO PEOPLE THAT SOMEHOW IF YOU LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IMMIGRATION WILL DISAPPEAR LIKE THE MORNING MIST MELTING IN THE MORNING SUN IT WELL IT IS A FACT OF LIFE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHETHER ARE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NOT ON THE WIDER ECONOMIC QUESTION WE'VE GOT GEORGE SOROS WEARING IN THIS MORNING AND OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL VODAFONE TALKING TO A SAILOR ON THE PROGRAMME HOW MANY IF WE WEREN'T IN THE WOOD WE'VE BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO JOIN DO YOU THINK ISN'T THAT ATTRACTIVE
I THINK IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU'D HAVE TO INVENT SOMETHING PRETTY CLOSE TO IT NO BUT IT EXISTED AND WE WEREN'T IN IT WILL BE TRYING TO JOIN THIS MORNING ABOUT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE DO YOU THINK I THINK IT WOULD I THINK I THINK EXCLUDING OURSELVES WHICH IS WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAVE SAID FROM THE WORLD'S LARGEST MARKET PLACE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CONSUMES WHICH BY THE WAY
A BRIT INVENTED SOMEONE MUCH OVERLOOKED LORD COE FEEL ENDORSED FIVE MARK FAILING ECONOMIC AREA HUGE MASS UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMY THAT STUCK IN THE MUD NOT GROWING AS FAR AS MOST STRIKING AS MOST OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD YOU THINK WE WOULD WILLINGLY WANT TO ATTACH OURSELVES TO THAT YOU'LL BE A TECTONIC CLEAR WE ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY IN EUROPE THAT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE BY THE VOTE ON THURSDAY MOST OF ARE THE BIGGEST
MARKETS FOR OUR EXPORTS AND BY THE WAY THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE EXPORTS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR ECONOMY NAMELY SERVICES WILL ALL GO TO THAT HUGE SINGLE MARKET WHICH WE BRITS CREATED WHY SHOULD WE TURN OUR BACK ON SOMETHING WHICH WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CREATED IF HE WAS SUCH A DISASTER BY THE WAY IF IT WAS THIS
ECONOMIC BALL AND CHAIN HOW COME AFTER FORTY ONE YEARS OF BEING A MEMBER OF THIS CLUB I'LL BE THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY IN IT IF IT WAS THE SOURCE OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE SO SUCCESSFUL ECONOMICALLY COMPARED TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD NICK CLEGG THANK YOU THANK YOU
WE'LL BE TALKING TO MICHAEL GAVE AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN DOMINIC IS BACK WITH MORE BUSINESS NEWS AND HERE'S A QUESTION FOR US ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO HELP OLDER WORKERS RETRAINED THANK YOU LOOK AT LEAST ONE ORGANISATION THINKS THAT WE DEFINITELY ARE NOT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY SAYS THAT WITH EMPLOYEE STAYING OR WORK LONGER WE NEED TO DO MORE TO RETRAIN STAFF WITH ME STEVE HILL DIRECTOR AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY COME HONESTLY
TRUTH IS THAT REALLY WERE ALL GOING TO BE WORKING LONGER WE BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING LONGER BUT A PENSIONS AREN'T GETTING ANY BIGGER WILL THIS AGEING WORKFORCE BE FIT FOR PURPOSE DO YOU THINK HIYA GOOD MORNING I THINK THE STATS SHOW THAT ARE CURRENTLY THAT ISN'T THE CASE THE U.K. LIKE SEVENTEEN POINTS BEHIND THE OTHER G. SEVEN NATIONS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND WE SIMPLY HAVE TO DO MORE
WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE GAP THAT EXISTS WE HAVE SCORED IT WAS COMING IN BUT THEY WON'T BE ENOUGH TO FILL THE GAP EN VACANCES WILL THEY KNOW I AM ABSOLUTELY SO OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE THIRTEEN MILLION VACANCIES BUT THERE WILL ONLY BE SEVEN MILLION SCHOOL LEAVERS AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT NINETY PER CENT OF THE WORKFORCE TODAY WILL STILL BE IN EMPLOYMENT IN TEN YEARS' TIME SO WHAT SHOULD EMPLOYERS BE DOING THEM
I THINK THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO UP SKILL THE SYSTEM WORKFORCE THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT CORPORATE MEMORY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WITNESS COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENGINEERS IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA SCIENTISTS AND THERE IS A REAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN THE AREAS OF CYBER SECURITY
SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOME OF THESE OLD STAGES AROUND TO STOP YOU MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN AND AGAIN THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT WE WILL ALL HAVE THREE FOUR FIVE CAREERS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR SKILLS UP TO DATE TOOK TO ADDRESS THE SKILLS SCHOOL'S CRAP WHERE IS THE BIGGER SCOUT WHAT SKILLS DO WE WE MOST NEED
WHAT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA SCIENTISTS AND WE ALSO TOTAL NO TODAY THE ROLES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED IN IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS' TIME THIS IS A BIT OF AN AGE OLD PROBLEM ISN'T BECAUSE COMPANIES DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO PAY FOR A TRAIN ALL OF THEM DO ANYWAY BUT THEY'RE HAPPY TO BY STAFF THE OTHER COMPANIES HAD TRAINED
THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT SOME FORM OF COMPULSION AN APPRENTICESHIP LIBBY NOT ALL COMPANIES ARE HAPPY WITH THIS IDEA ARE THEY WON'T KNOW MANY COMPANIES ALREADY PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THEIR STAFF AND ONE CONCERN AROUND THE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY WILL BE THAN THE NEED TO TO TO BUY CERTAIN APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING A FREE CHOICE ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT THEY PREFER THAT THEIR FREEDOM BUT OF COURSE IF YOU GIVE THEM FREEDOM MAYBE THEY WON'T DO THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO DO
WELL SOME DO BUT AS A STOP A FINISH WHERE I STARTED IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES WE HAVE WITH PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT MANY DON'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH STEVE HILL DIRECTOR AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY DOMINIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES AFTER SEVEN
OF THE WAITING OVER HALF A CENTURY TO TAKE PART IN A MAJOR FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT WELSH FANS CAN NOW CELEBRATE TOPPING THEIR GROUP AT THE EUROS HAVING BEEN RUSSIA THREE NIL NOT ONLY THAT THEY PUSHED ENGLAND INTO SECOND PLACE CUE WILD CELEBRATIONS
WALES OR JOIN IN THE LAST SIXTEEN IS
OH NO EMOTION NOW IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE'D BE ON
THE MOUNTS PLAYERS THEY WERE AWESOME AND THE BRING IN THERE OH MY GOD
NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN NOW OVER THE EXCESS THAT NOW LITTLE CRY AMAZING AMAZING CAKE
WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN
IT IS A WONDERFUL JOURNEY LET'S HOPE IT CARRIES ON FOR QUITE A WHILE IT'S A NAIL TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE INTERNET IS BEING USED TO ABUSE CHILDREN THAT MUCH WE KNEW THE SCALE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ONLINE IS THEY WERE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO EMERGE AND N.S.P.C.C. SURVEY OF POLICE FORCES SUGGESTED AT LEAST EIGHT SEXUAL OFFENCES ARE COMMITTED ONLINE
EACH AND EVERY DAY AND THAT SURVEY DIDN'T INCLUDE ALL THE BIGGEST POLICE FORCES IT TO REFLECT ON WHAT THAT MIGHT TELL US IS VICKY SHADBOLT WHO'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF PARENTS OWN AND SHE ALSO SITS ON THE U.K. COUNCIL FOR CHILD INTERNET SAFETY COMMITTEE THAT ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST ON THE STATS FIRST OF ALL SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED BY THIS SCALE OF ABUSE
I THINK WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED I THINK THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE TRUE IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF THE INTERNET WASN'T INVOLVED IN THESE SORTS OF CRIMES AND I THINK IF ANYTHING THE FIGURES ARE ON THE LOW SIDE I THINK THE REAL PICTURE IS PROBABLY EVEN WORSE AND TALK US THROUGH IT I MEAN NOT EXPLICITLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT IF YOU DON'T MIND BUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED ON LINE
I THINK FOR CHILDREN THE THE CRIMES OPTICALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS RESEARCH COVER EVERYTHING FROM CHILDREN BEING ENCOURAGED TO SHARE INAPPROPRIATE IMAGES THROUGH TO CHILDREN BEING ENCOURAGED TO MEET OFFLINE WITH STRANGERS AND RAT LEADING TO TWO REALLY QUITE SERIOUS CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN TO ONCE AGAIN IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW WE AS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS CAN YVON THESE CHILDREN ON HOW TO USE THE INTERNET SAFELY WHAT DO YOU NOW RECOMMEND
IT'S A REALLY TRICKY ONE BECAUSE WHAT A LOT OF THE FOCUS TENDS TO END UP BEING ON IS HIS RISK AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TO SAY THAT CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO TAKE RISK ONLINE BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S HEALTHY AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF CHILDREN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO USE THE INTERNET WELL THIS IS QUITE QUITE DIFFERENT THIS IS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM HARM AND THE REALLY CRUCIAL THING THAT THAT PARENTS NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT CHILDREN HAVE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT COMING FORWARD WHEN THEY FEEL AS THOUGH THEY'RE IN DANGER AND AT THE MOMENT CHILDREN DON'T FEEL CHILDREN FEEL VERY RELUCTANT TO REPORT THEIR PARENTS OR ANYONE ELSE
IF THEY'RE BEING HARMED ON MINE WHAT'S STRIKING IS THAT AS A CHILD WE GREW UP WITH ROAD SAFETY MESSAGES DIMLY MY GOODNESS THE TUFTY CLUB THE GREEN CROSS CODE ALL THAT SORT OF THING IS THERE A NEED FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AND AS APPEALING TO CHILDREN AS THAT OR FRANKLY IS THAT FROM ANOTHER ERA WOULD NEVER WORK OH I THINK THAT IS FROM ANOTHER ERA AND IT IS KIND OF THAT THE HOLY GRAIL OF INTERNET SAFETY EVERYBODY STAYS COULDN'T WE JUST DO A ROAD SAFETY CAMPAIGN AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THE THE ONLINE WORLD IS AS COMPLEX IF NOT MORE COMPLEX
THEN THE OFFLINE WHAT AND IT JUST ISN'T THAT EASY TO BOIL IT DOWN TO A SIMPLE MESSAGE BUT AWARENESS IS THE CRUCIAL MESSAGES IN THE SENSE OF YOU WANT A CHILD TO BE AWARE THAT CAR COMING FUCK DISC IN A POTENTIALLY A KILLER IT WOULD A CHILD KNOWING THAT EVERYBODY YOU MEET ON THE INTERNET IS NOT A FRIEND HE'S A POTENTIAL RISK AND ONE SHOULD BE A SENSIBLE QUESTIONS THESE ARE THINGS YOU COULD TEACH THEM ON OH ABSOLUTELY AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLINE WORLD IS A COMPLICATED PLACE AND YOU HAVE TO BE
VERY AWARE OF THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE ON THEY'RE NOT ALL OF HIM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART AND THERE ARE SOME SKILLS I MEAN IT IS POSSIBLE TO TEACH CHILDREN HOW TO BLOCK PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE TALKING TO HOW TO REPORT WHEN THEY NEED TO SO THERE ARE SKILLS THEY'RE ALSO LIFE SKILLS THAT WE HAVE TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND THE OTHER QUESTION PARENTS ASK THEMSELVES IS TO WHAT EXTENT THEY SHOULD IN EFFECT SPY ON WHAT THEIR CHILDREN DOING DO YOU LOOK AT THEIR INTERNET HISTORY DO YOU BLOCK OFF ACCESS TO CERTAIN SIDES DO YOU TRY TO LOOK AT THEIR FACE BUT WE COUNT AND SO ON WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND
SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH THAT WE DID WITH THE OXFORD INSET INSTITUTE AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE MORE YOU BLOCK THE MORE YOU FILTER THE MORE YOU EVEN CO USE THE INTERNET WITH YOUR CHILDREN THE LESS SAFE THEY BECOME BECAUSE BECAUSE CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN THEIR OWN RESILIENCE THEY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE THEIR SPACES PRIVACY AND OPEN COMMUNICATION ARE REALLY CRUCIAL
BRIEFLY YOU CAN'T DO IT FOR THEM YOU CAN'T THEY YOU CAN TEACH THEM HOW THEY MIGHT DO IT EXACTLY THAT EXACTLY THAT VICKY SHADBOLT APPARENTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN OR WE TURN BACK TO SPORT I SAID BACK TIGS WE WERE HERE IT WON'T BE FROM WELSH FANS JUST A MOMENT AGO AND ANOTHER WELSH FAN IS GIVING US A SPORTS NEWS THIS MORNING NO MATTHEW

OFFICIAL ACTION LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE STRIKE IS IT IS A DISPUTE ESSENTIALLY ABOUT WHO OPENS AND CLOSES TRAIN DOORS NO THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANY WANTS YOU TO PROMOTE IT'S ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE GUARD IT'S ABOUT THE DILUTION OF SAFETY ON THE RAIL SYSTEM GUARDS AND CONDUCTORS TRAIN MANAGERS WHAT IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM THEY CALLED A LOT OF THINGS IN DIFFERENT PLACES HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SAFETY CRITICAL ROLE THE COMPANIES BOTH SCOTT AND GO THE SOUTHERN AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO REMOVE THE SAFETY CRITICAL ROLE OF THE GOD SO THAT THEY CAN DILUTE
THE SAFETY SYSTEM AND MAKE MORE MONEY OUT AND THAT IS NOT ABOUT OPENING DOORS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE RAIL SAY THAT IN STANDARDS BOARD THEY POINT OUT THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE TRAINS THE DOORS ARE CURRENTLY OPEN BY THE DRIVER NOT BY THE GUARD AND THEY SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY DETERIORATION IN SAFETY AS A RESULT WELL THEY ARE RECIPES BEEN WHEELED OUT TO PROPER GO VIA THE ARTIST PLEASE A MEMBERSHIP ORGANISATION IS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY THE TRAIN COMPANIES WE CAN'T BELIEVE
I DON'T BELIEVE THEM NO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A COMPANY THAT INVESTIGATES INCIDENTS WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE MANAGEMENT OF RISK BUT GIVEN THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF TRAINS THE DOORS ARE OPENED BY DRIVERS NATIONAL WHERE WHERE'S THE PROBLEM NATIONALLY SEVENTY PER CENT OF TRYING TO OPERATE BY GUARDS ON CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN RAIL NETWORK WAS A HIGHER PER CENT YES IT WAS THE OTHER WAS BROUGHT IN A FEW YEARS AGO PRESUMABLY WE'D SEE A SAFETY PROBLEM ON THEIR OWN SO IF YOU WERE THERE A TRAP AND DRAG INCIDENTS ON THE RAILWAY
QUITE OFTEN THE R. A. L. UP AND DRAG HIM INTO SOMEBODY GETTING CAUGHT PEOPLE GETTING CAUGHT IN THE DOOR THAN DRAGGED ALONG WHICH CAN OBVIOUSLY CAUSE LIFE CHANGING INJURIES AND EVEN FOR TALLY'S THEY WERE TWO MAJOR INCIDENTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BOLDLY R. A. R. I B. WHICH INVESTIGATES INCIDENTS NOT RISK AND WE WERE WAITING FOR THEIR CONCLUSIONS THE OBVIOUS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION IS THAT YOU'RE FAR SAFER WITH SOMEBODY WHOSE PURPOSE AND ROLL
UNDER LAW AND UNDER THE RULES IS TO LOOK AFTER THE SAFETY OF THE PASSENGERS ISN'T THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE AND SEE OVER THE YEARS HAS PROVED THAT IT'S VERY VERY GOOD JOB PROTECTION AND ALWAYS PRETENDS THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN SAFETY PROTECTION NOW WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN JOB PERFECTION WERE INTERESTED IN JOB SECURITY WELL PAID JOBS FOR THE DESERVING PEOPLE THAT DO A GOOD JOB BUT YOU'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC THIS STRIKE IS ALL ABOUT SAFETY MEMBERS ARE SACRIFICING THEIR DETECTING GUARDS JOBS
NO IT'S ABOUT THEY'VE BEEN OFFERED JOBS IN ALTERNATE IF IT'S ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE GOD WHICH WE BELIEVE IN WE SINCERELY BELIEVE IT SAFER TO HAVE CALLED WHO ARE PROPERLY TRAINED AND COMPETENT TO PROTECT THE PASSENGERS NOT TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S REVENUE LAST ONE THERE MAY BE MANY THINGS JUST A BRIEF ON IF YOU WERE THERE MAY BE MANY PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOU WERE CRITICAL OF THE COMPANY TOO
WHAT PROSPECT AT THIS ENDING IS THERE AND THERE'S A PROSPECT YOU MUST WANT TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT YOU MUST COME TO THE TABLE LOOKING FOR COMPROMISE WE'RE READY AND ABLE AND WILLING TO MEET WITH THEM TODAY WE THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET INVOLVED IN PARLIAMENT SHOULD LOOK AT THE FRANCHISE THIS COMPANY'S INCOMPETENT AND WE WANT TO GET A DEAL
LYNCH AND THEY ARE EMPTY THANK YOU JOIN US THANK YOU TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT THAT'S OWING TO THE PAPERS AND ONCE MORE ACROSS THE REFERENDUM DOMINATING THE ALMEIDA CLAIRE'S FORTY EIGHT HOURS EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS THE OUTCOME IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL WITH RESEARCH SUGGESTING IT'S HARDER FOR POSTERS TO REACH REMAINS SUPPORTERS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR GRAZES DOWN TO THE WIRE QUOTING DAVID CAMERON'S ELECTION STRATEGIST LYNTON CROSBY SAYS THE RESULT IS UNCERTAIN
DESPITE A BOOST IN THE POLES FOR THE REMAIN CAMP AT THE PAPER GIVES OVER HALF OF ITS FRONT PAGE TO EXPLAIN ITS SUPPORT FOR BRECHT'S SAYING IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN FEAR AND HOPE AND HE CHOOSES HOPE THE GARDEN DOES THE SAME WITH THE PLAYERS FOR THE REMAIN CAMP IT MAKES A DIRECT APPEAL TO THE ELECTORATE TO VOTE FOR A UNIFIED UNITED COUNTRY
THERE IS A CERTAIN LYRICISM AND THE ACCOUNTS OF PARLIAMENT'S TRIBUTES TO THE MURDERED M.P. JOE COX VOICES SHOOK AND EARS FELL IN HER HOUSE UNITED SAYS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE DAILY MAIL DESCRIBED THE MOMENT THE VOICE OF THE LATE M.P.S TODDLER HIS HEARD IN THE CHAMBER HAS A PICCOLO FLUTING UNDER THIS VAST VAULTED ROOF QUENTIN LETTS WRITES IN THAT INSTANT THE
HUMAN COST OF THIS KILLING WAS VOICED THE TIMES WARNS THAT IN THE WAKE OF THE DEATH M.P.S NEED NOW TO DRAIN WHAT IT CALLS THE UNHEALTHY SWAN
WHICH THE REFERENDUM DEBATE HAS CREATED SIR CLIFF RICHARD HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THE DAILY MAIL ABOUT WHAT IT CALLS HIS TWO YEARS OF HELL WHILE HE FACED ALLEGATIONS OF HISTORIC CHILD ABUSE THE STAR WAS TOLD LAST WEEK THAT HE WOULDN'T FACE ANY CHARGES AND HE SAYS NOW THAT THE STRESS OF THE INVESTIGATION MADE HIM THINK IT WAS GOING TO DIE HE DISMISSES THE ALLEGATIONS AS RIDICULOUS SAYING HE WAS MEANT TO HAVE CARRIED OUT A MOLESTATION ONCE WELL WHILE ON ROLLER SKATES HE TELLS THE MAIL THAT HE FORGIVES HIS ACCUSER
BUT HIS ANGER ABOUT HIS TREATMENT BY SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AND THE B. B. C. REMAINS THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS SIR CLOSE EXPERIENCE SHOULD INFURIATE ANYBODY CONCERNED ABOUT JUSTICE SAYING THE INNOCENT SHOULD NOT BE LEFT IN LIMBO FOR SO LONG THE DAILY EXPRESS SAID HE'S BEEN TREATED APPALLINGLY AND HOPES TELLING HIS STORY WILL HELP HIM FIND CLOSURE THE TIMES SAYS THE TRAIN COMPANIES COULD BE FINED IF THEIR SERVICES OR EVEN JUST ONE MINUTE LATE CURRENT RULES GIVE INTERCITY SERVICES UP TO TEN MINUTES' GRACE
THE RAIL REGULATOR TELLS THE PAPER THE PUBLIC FINDS THIS UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE NEW RULES COULD COME IN WITHIN THREE YEARS THAT IT'S WORTH FINISHING BY SAYING THAT ANY DISCORD ON THE FRONT PAGES CONTRASTS WITH AGREEMENT ON THE BACK THE MIRROR THE SUN AND THE TIMES OR CONCURRING ENGLAND
WERE SECOND RATE AND IT IN THE DAILY STAR CRITICISES AND SIX CHANGES TO THE TEAM LINE UP SAYING ROY HODGSON'S GAMBLE GOES WRONG THE DAILY MAIL CELEBRATES THE WELSH SUCCESS CALLING GARETH BALE PRINCE OF WALES GIVES THE SAME TITLE TO HODGSON BUT WITH A DIFFERENT SPELLING OF WALES GET IT
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE YOU BELIEVE BRECK'S IT COULD EITHER DECIMATE THE SETTEE SENDING JOBS AND BANKS TO CITIES LIKE PARIS OR FRANK WET FAT OR IT COULD ALLOW THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL SERVICES TO OPERATE UNFETTERED BY RULES IMPOSED FROM BRUSSELS AND DO MUCH BETTER WHO IS RIGHT OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME OUT A COMMENT HAS BEEN TO THE SQUARE MILE TO FIND
THE CITY OF LONDON IS THE CENTRE OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR IT'S THE MORNING RUSH HOUR AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING THEIR WAY
SOMETIMES WE TEND TO THINK OF THE U.K.'S FINANCIAL SERVICES ARE SIMPLY THE BANKS
BUT IT IS ALSO OF COURSE INSURANCE COMPANIES FUND MANAGERS ACCOUNTANCY IN LAW FIRMS WHICH TOGETHER EMPLOY OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE FROM BOURNEMOUTH TO ABERDEEN
IT IS A MAJOR EXPORT INDUSTRY WITH A TRADE SURPLUS OF EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS WITH THE REST
THE MAJOR QUESTION HOW WOULD SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE U.K. ECONOMY BE AFFECTED IF BRITAIN WERE TO PLUMP FOR BRECHT'S
WHEN HE INTERNATIONAL BANKS AT THE CORE OF THE U.K.'S FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THEY OPPOSE SUCH A MOVE BUT THE PICTURE IS NUANCED ANTHONY BROWN IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH BANKERS' ASSOCIATION
HOW MUCH IT MATTERS TO THEM DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IF YOU'RE A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL WHOLESALE BANK THAT OPERATES ACROSS EUROPE OUT OF OFFICES IN LONDON THEN CLEARLY HAVING FULL AND UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET IS ABSOLUTELY BUSINESS CRITICAL AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY VOCAL
BUT IF YOU'RE A U.K. ONLY BANKERS WERE REGIONAL RETAIL BANK FOR EXAMPLE THAN ACTUALLY ACCESS TO THE E.U. IS LESS IMPORTANT TO THEY TEND TO BE LESS
I'VE JUST COME ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO THIRTY THREE CANNON STREET
IT'S A PRETTY NONDESCRIPT BUILDING BUT ACTUALLY IT'S THE CENTRE OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICES THE CITY PROVIDES
ORGANISING BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT Y. YOU BUSINESSES
THIS SERVICE IS CALLED EURO NOMINATED CLEARING SOME THINK IT COULD BE A RISK THE BRITAIN LEADS THE EU
THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS ALREADY GOT ITS EYE ON IT SAME THAT EURO CLEARING BUSINESS WILL BE BETTER RELOCATED IN THE EUROZONE ARE PRESENT BRITAIN HAS BLOCKED THE E.C. C.B.S PROPOSALS BY TAKING LEGAL ACTION BY THE EUROPEAN COURTS
MATILDA HER WHY IS A FRENCH ECONOMIST A FORMER ADVISOR TO THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER DOMINIC DE VILLE AND NOW SITS ON THAT COUNTRY'S EQUIVALENT OF THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC WATCHDOG
I THINK THAT IF A EUROPEAN SON FOUND MONKEY DECIDES LOCATION OF THE CLEANING HOUSES
WITHIN A DAY EUROZONE THAT MANY EUROPEAN AS WELL AS NINE EUROPEAN BANKS WILL FOLLOW THE PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW THEIR THEREFORE DISC ELF WILL MOVE FROM LONDON TO THERE'S YOUR BEN YOU KNOW
GOOD NEWS THEN FOR THE FINANCIAL CAPITALS OF THE EUROZONE THAT'S FRANKFURT AND PARIS LES GOOD POSSIBLY FOR LONDON
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT TRADING ISSUES IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE BANKS INSURANCE COMPANIES THE WHOLE PANOPLY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE U.K. WILL ALSO BE WATCHING THE BRITISH ECONOMY CLOSELY IF BRECHT'S IT HAPPENS THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT MANY ECONOMISTS PREDICT WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR THE CITY
MADAME LE WILD THING STERLING WILL FALL DRAMATICALLY BUT SHE IS NOT AS GLOOMY AS MOST SAYING THERE WILL BE A DYNAMIC RESPONSE BY POLICY MAKERS TO EASE ANY ECONOMIC PAIN
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE PRIMING AND GOVERNMENT OFFICER THAN COFFIN GLEN WOULDN'T DO NURSING TO IMPROVE AS A SITUATION OFF COURSE THEY WOULD ACT WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE DECLINE INDEED YOU PLEASE
I REALLY THINK IT IS ILLUSORY TO THINK THAT LONDON WOULD SOMEHOW WITH THE WAY HE'D DIE IF IT WASN'T FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN ON THE CONTRARY BORIS JOHNSON MAKING HIS VIEWS PRETTY CLEAR HIS FORMER ADVISER IS GERARD LINES FOR HIM LONDON OUTSIDE THE REGULATORY CLUTCHES OF THE E.U. WOULD BE THE CENTRE OF CHOICE FOR GLOBAL FINANCE
WHICHEVER WAY ONE LOOKS AT IT I THINK LONDON AND THE CITY WILL REMAIN THE MAJOR FINANCIAL CENTRE OF EUROPE WHAT EVER HAPPENS IN THE REFERENDUM AND I THINK THE LONGER TERM OUTLOOK IS TO ACTUALLY POSITIONED LONDON NOT JUST WITHIN THE E.U. BUT AGAINST A FUTURE COMPETITION FROM NEW YORK SINGAPORE HONG KONG AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT ABILITY TO DO THAT OUTSIDE THE E.U. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF REMAINING WITHIN THE U.K.
THE END OF THE DAY IN THE CITY AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE STREAMING HOME THE SUN'S OUT IT'S A PRETTY NICE EVENING BUT THAT'S ALMOST A PALPABLE SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN ON REFERENDUM DAY
MANY OF THESE WORKERS KNOW THAT ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH IT COULD BE WAKING UP TO THE PROSPECT OF A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD AND THE MARKETS WILL GIVE THEIR JUDGEMENT THEN AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES IN BRITAIN
COME ON AHMED REPORTING THERE IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS LAURA JANNA CLOWNS WHO SENIOR RABBI TO REFORM JUDAISM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICK
WHEN MAJOR TIM PEAKE RETURNED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ON SATURDAY HE YEARNED TO SEE HIS FAMILY AS WELL AS FOR A PIZZA AND A COLD BEER HE'D BEEN CRAMMED ALONG WITH TWO OTHER ASTRONAUTS INTO A BOILING TINY CAPSULE JUST TWO METRES WIDE LANDING BACK ON EARTH MUST BE UNIMAGINABLY BUMPY AND THE IMPACT ON HIS BODY WAS LIKENED TO THAT OF A SERIOUS CAR CRASH HE DESCRIBED THE PROCESS OF RETURNING AS BEING SIMILAR TO THE WORLD'S WORST HANGOVER
HE EXPLAINED THAT THE MOST UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY OF HIS SIX MONTH MISSION WAS SIMPLY THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE AND AS HE SAID WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AWAY FROM EARTH YOU SEE HOW DARK SPACE IS IT'S JUST THE BLACKEST BLACK
I WONDER WHAT IT FELT LIKE FOR HIM WHAT IT DID TO HIS SPIRIT TO FACE SUCH DARKNESS DAY AFTER DAY IN MY BLEAK DARK MOMENTS I NEED TO CONSCIOUSLY FORCED MYSELF TO LOOK THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO TURN MY HEAD AWAY FROM THAT DARKNESS AND TO KEEP FOCUSED ON BEING ON THIS EARTH WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW AND THIS WEEK THE TOURIST SECTION SOME JEWS ARE READING HIGHLIGHTS DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ADVERSITY
WHEN THE ISRAELITES WERE WANDERING IN THE WILDERNESS THE TRIAD DESCRIBES HER MO'S THIS DISPATCH TWELVE OF THEM TO SCOUT OUT THE LAND OF CANAAN IT INSTRUCTED THEM TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK ASSESS THE PEOPLE NOW THEY STRONG OR WEAK
IS THE LAND PLEASANT OR HARSH ARE THEIR FORESTS ALL TWELVE SCOUTS WERE IN THE SAME LAND AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEY EXPERIENCED IT VERY DIFFERENTLY TEN OF THEM WERE PETRIFIED EXCLAIMING AT THE PEOPLE WERE LIKE GIANTS LIKE OGRES AND THAT IN COMPARISON THEY FELT LIKE GRASSHOPPERS
ALL THE ISRAELITES RESPONDED WITH A WHALING UPROAR AND ARE CALLED TO REBEL AGAINST MOSES WHY IS GOD BROUGHT US TO THIS COUNTRY TO KILL US WHY DON'T WE JUST HEAD BACK TO EGYPT AND RIGHT NOW
BUT TWO SCOUTS CALIPH EVAN JOSHUA SAW BEYOND THEIR OWN FEARS THEY WERE COURAGEOUS AND TRIED TO CALM THE CROWD SAYING DON'T BE AFRAID OF THEM OF THOSE CANAANITES WE'VE GOD'S PROTECTION WE CAN OVERCOME THIS THEY CHOSE
TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE BLEAKEST OPTIONS TOWARDS THE GOODNESS OF THEIR LAND AND SO UNLIKE THE OTHERS CALIPH WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE THERE AND JOSHUA WAS REWARDED WITH LEADING THE ISRAELITES AFTER MOSES HIS DEATH
I LIVE JOSHUA WELL MAJOR PEAK MODEL HOW WE CAN REASSESS OUR REACTIONS SO THAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE THE BLACKEST BLACK AS TRANQUILLITY INSTEAD OF TURBULENCE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WHEN LAURA JANNA CLOWNS NOW THE TIME TEN TO EIGHT THERE IS A REVOLT GOING ON IN THE AMERICAN STATE DEPARTMENT EVER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SYRIA POLICY DOZENS OF DIPLOMATS HAVE SIGNED A MEMO SUGGESTING THAT PRESIDENT ASAD'S REGIME SHOULD BE BOMBED THAN HELLO HAS REKINDLED THE DEBATE ABOUT OBAMA'S RELUCTANCE TO GET INVOLVED IN SYRIA HIS OWN FORMER MIDDLE EAST ADVISER PHILIP GORDON WHO WAS SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT WHITE HOUSE COORDINATOR OF MIDDLE EAST POLICY
HAS BEEN TALKING TO ME SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DECISION NOT TO PUNISH ASAD FOLLOWING HIS USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS REMEMBER IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WAS A THREAT TO BOMB HIM BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE THE U.S. STOOD DOWN MY GORDON HE'S NOT A FAN OF REGIME CHANGE SHE DOESN'T THINK BOMBING NOW WOULD BE WISE BUT HE DOES THINK AN OPPORTUNITY THEN WAS LOST I BELIEVED AT THE TIME AND STILL BELIEVE TODAY
HAVING SAID THAT THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD BE A RED LINE FOR THE UNITED STATES IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BACK THAT UP
AND IF WE SAID THERE WOULD BE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR VIOLATING AN INTERNATIONAL OR ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND KILLING A THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WE MEANT IT BECAUSE THE FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY SAYING TO A STARLING ANYONE ELSE FEEL FREE TO USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AS YOU SEE FIT BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW OF COURSE
IN THE END IT TURNED OUT ARGUABLY EVEN BETTER BECAUSE WE ENDED UP GETTING US DEAL WITH THE RUSSIANS TO GET RID OF THE BULK OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUT THAT'S NOT A LUXURY YOU HAVE AT THE TIME WHEN YOU MAKE THAT DECISION WHICH AGAIN AS WHY I THOUGHT AT THE TIME AND STILL THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A RED LINE FAWCETT BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ARGUING
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO SYRIA MILITARILY WITH SOME AGAIN BUT YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE REGIME BECAUSE I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD HELP HAD OTHER COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES YES BUT EVEN THE DECISION TO BOMB WOULD HAVE HAD OTHER CONSEQUENCES I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT IF THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN MADE THEN OTHER THINGS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THE POTENTIALLY MIGHT HAVE LED TO A BETTER OUTCOME THAN THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ONCE YOU START USING MILITARY FORCE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ENDS
I WOULD BE VERY WARY OF THE NOTION THAT A COUPLE OF DAYS OF BOMBING TO DEGRADE OR CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPACITY AND PUNISH FOR THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD HAVE LED TO THE COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL TRANSITION TO A. STABLE GOVERNMENT THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE
THERE'S MORE REASON TO BELIEVE AND I THINK THIS WAS ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CONCERNS AT THE TIME THAT IT ULTIMATELY BECOMES A SLIPPERY SLOPE
USE LIMITED FORCE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE EFFECT THAT YOU WANT YOU THEN USE A BIT MORE FORCE AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN A WAR AND YOU'VE POSSIBLY
VIOLENTLY OVERTHROWN THE REGIME AND I CALL THIS THE AT THE ROAD NOT TRAVEL PROBLEM IT'S EASY FOR CRITICS TO SAY WELL IF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD JUST BOMBED THEN MAYBE THIS WOULD HAVE ALL TURNED OUT BETTER WELL MAYBE BUT MAYBE NOT BUT WHAT EFFECT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE HAD GIVEN THAT YOU WANTED TO DO IT AT THE TIME YOU STILL BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED I THINK WHY
WHATEVER HAPPENED IS A SAAB WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS A REAL PRICE TO PAY FOR USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND WOULD HAVE REFRAIN FROM DOING SO AGAIN THAT IS A LIMITED OBJECTIVE
AND IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE LIMITED OBJECTS OBJECTIVES WITH LIMITED USE OF FORCE A REMEMBER IN THE COURSE OF A WAR WE HAD A LIMITED OBJECTIVE
WHICH WAS JUST TO GET SERBIAN MILITARY FORCES SECURITY FORCES OUT OF PART OF THE COUNTRY AND WE MANAGED TO DO THAT BUT ONLY WITH SEVENTY EIGHT DAYS OF NATO BOMBING IN THE THREAT OF A GROUND FORCE AND EXTREME PRESSURE
BUT WE'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IT LIMITED OBJECTIVE I SUPPOSE THE THING IS THAT PEOPLE LOOKING AT SYRIA NOW AND SAYING WHAT AN APPALLING CATASTROPHE AT HIS AND COULDN'T ANYTHING HAVE BEEN DONE AT LEAST TO REDUCE AT THE MARGINS THE SUFFERING OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AND WHAT YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING IS WELL YES THIS WOULDN'T HAVE SOLVED IT BUT IT COULD'VE HELPED
NOBODY CAN LOOK AT THE SITUATION IN SYRIA TODAY AND BE COMPLACENT OR SOMEHOW SATISFIED IT IS A REAL DISASTER AT THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OBVIOUSLY HUMANITARIAN DISASTER BUT IT'S ALSO STRATEGIC DISASTER IN TERMS OF UNDERMINING THE STABILITY OF THE NEIGHBOURS YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE REFUGEE FLOAT TO EUROPE WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE RADICALISATION OF LOT OF YOUNG MUSLIMS
STILL TO THIS DAY NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT EARLY MILITARY SUPPORT TO THE REBELS OR EVEN DIRECT MILITARY FORCE BY THE UNITED STATES WOULD HAVE LED TO A TRANSITION THAT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE VIOLENCE IN THE DISPLACEMENT THAT WE SEE TODAY
IS THERE A WIDER SENSE IN WHICH THE DIMINUTION OF AMERICAN POWER IN THE SENSE OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT HAS SAID SOMETHING AND NOT FOLLOWED UP ON IT HAS THAT HAD WIDER CONSEQUENCES YES I THINK IT IS
HERE THAT THAT DECISION HAD WIDER REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND
WHAT TOOK PLACE IN SYRIA IN TERMS OF AMERICAN CREDIBILITY AND POWER NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN VERY ARTICULATE ON THE QUESTION OF CREDIBILITY AND I THINK RIGHTLY SAYS IT IS OFTEN OVERSTATED
AND IT IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD REASON TO USE FORCE OR GOING TO WAR JUST TO BOLSTER YOUR CREDIBILITY AND LINKING SYRIA TO THINGS LIKE THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF CRIME HERE
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE NONETHELESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE USE OF FORCE IF OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE REALLY JUST NOT PREPARED TO DO IT
EVEN WHEN YOU SAID YOU ARE I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES I THINK INEVITABLY RAISES QUESTIONS IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
I THINK WE SEE THAT EVERYWHERE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO ASIA TO YOU STRING
CONCERNS THAT THE UNITED STATES MIGHT NOT BE IN A POSITION TO DETER OTHERS FROM ACTING SO IN THAT SENSE I THINK TWENTY THIRTEEN DECISION
HAD REPERCUSSIONS THAT THAT WENT EVEN BEYOND THE SITUATION SERIOUS ITSELF FOR THE GORDON THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US

MY VIEW IS FIRSTLY WE JUST HAVE TO BE CANDID WITH PEOPLE THAT THE LARGE SCALE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ACROSS LARGE DISTANCES WHETHER THEY'RE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS OR REFUGEES IS A FACT OF INTERNATIONAL LIFE WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH THE UPSIDES AND THE CHALLENGES AND THE DILEMMAS WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR NOT

THANK YOU SUSAN IT IS TEN PAST EIGHT IN JUST THREE DAYS' TIME WE'LL KNOW THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE SPOKEN THEIR VOTES WILL HAVE BEEN COUNTED BRITAIN'S DESTINY WILL BE CLEAR BUT THE FORCES UNLEASHED BY THIS E.U. REFERENDUM WE'RE NOT SUDDENLY BE STILLED ON FRIDAY MORNING
IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE IT'LL BE THE TURN OF THE MARKETS TO HAVE THEIR SAY ALONG WITH THE E.U. PARTNERS WE'VE CHOSEN TO WALK OUT ON AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WHO WE HOPE TO BUILD NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH SO WHAT MIGHT THAT FUTURE LOOK LIKE A FUTURE THERE BEGINS AS EARLY AS FRIDAY MORNING TOMORROW WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO A PROMINENT REMAIN CAMPAIGNER
THIS MORNING WHIP DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY MICHAEL GAVE JUSTICE SECRETARY OF COURSE AND THE INTELLECTUAL POWERHOUSE OF BELIEVE COMPANY GOOD MORNING TO YOU THAT'S VERY KIND I'M NOT FROM AN INTELLECTUAL ANYTHING THAT'S VERY SWEET WHAT WE'LL SEE WE WILL SEE HER YOU SAY WILL TAKE BACK CONTROL IF WE LEAVE THE E. YOU THIS MORNING AS YOU WILL KNOW GEORGE SAW US IS PREDICTING A BIGGER FALL IN THE POUND THAN THERE WAS OF THE BLACK WEDNESDAY NOW JUST IN TWO DAYS' TIME WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CONTROL THE PEOPLE YOU OR THE MARKET SPECULATORS LIKE GEORGE SOROS
THE PEOPLE BEING CONTROL ULTIMATE IT WHAT HAPPENS IN MARKETS IS A REFLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY AND WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST QUARTER EVEN AS WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS PASSIONATE AND ENGAGED TO DEBATE ABOUT BRITAIN'S FUTURE AND EVEN AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEEKING TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THAT RESULT MIGHT BE THAT EMPLOYMENT HAS GONE UP
MANUFACTURING OUTPUT HAS GONE UP THE BRITISH ECONOMY INCLUDING THE POUND HAS STRENGTHENED ANYBODY WITH A MEMORY OF BLACK WEDNESDAY WILL REMEMBER WHAT IT MEANT INTEREST RATES GOING UP OF COURSE PRICES GO UP WITH THE HAM GOES DOWN AS EXPORTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THEY MAY NOT BE MIGHTILY COMFORTED AT THE IDEA THAT ONE DAY THEY WILL HAVE SOVEREIGNTY IT WILL FEEL TO THEM LIKE THE MARKETS ARE IN CHARGE BECAUSE A DECISION WAS TAKEN THAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DON'T LIKE WELL I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO SAY THE FIRST
GEORGE SOROS HIMSELF IS AN ADVOCATE OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY USE AN ADVOCATE OF GREATER EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND HE HIMSELF SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THE SINGLE CURRENCY WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR EUROPE AND ANCHOR OF STABILITY NO IS HE ONE OF THOSE EXPERTS THE YOU SAY WE SHOULD SIMPLY IGNORE COS YOU APPARENTLY YOU THINK WE SHOULD ALL EXPERTS THESE DAYS I'VE NEVER SAID THAT WE SHOULD IGNORE ALL EXPERTS I SPECIFICALLY SAID AND THE SUPPLIES WE HEARD ENOUGH FROM EXPERTS WAS YOUR LINE THAT WAS HALF THE LINE THE THEM AS WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF EXPERTS FROM ORGANISATIONS WITH ACRONYMS THAT GOT THE SINGLE CURRENCY WRONG
YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN WHO SAYS THAT WHEN I MET LET'S LET'S NOT GO AND RUSSIAN SEE A DOCTOR THAT AN EXPERT PERISH ME NO WE OUGHT TO DO INSTEAD IS POP DOWN THE PUB AND YOU TAKE A SURVEY OF OPINION IF ECONOMIC FORECASTERS WERE AS LIABLE AS DOCTORS OR AIRLINE PILOTS BUT THEN EVERYONE WOULD BE A BILLIONAIRE THE TRUTH IS THAT ECONOMIC FORECASTERS LIKE GEORGE SOROS I'VE GOT THINGS WRONG IN THE PAST THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WHO ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD JOIN THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE SINGLE CURRENCY AS YOU KNOW HAS BROUGHT ECONOMIC MISERY
A MEDAL IF YOU WANT IN FACT BUT MURIEL RIBBING HE'S ANOTHER ONE HE PREDICTED THE TWO A THOUSAND A. CRASH HE SAYS BRECHT'S IT COULD STALL THE U.K. ECONOMY AND TIP IT INTO RECESSION AS THE SHOP TO BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE COULD BE SAID THAT WE SHOULD IGNORE HIM AS WELL SHOULD WE DO JEMELL AND WHO'S ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR WHO I THINK ALSO ANTICIPATED THE TWO THOUSAND IN THE CRASH BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE DID ARGUES THAT WILL BE STRONGER
OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THAT WHEN WE REFLECT ON WHAT GEORGE FORREST ARE SAYING WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE GOT THINGS WRONG IN THE PAST WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
BUT THE SINGLE CURRENCY AND EUROPE'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURES HAVE MEANT THAT THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT HAS LOWER GROWTH THAN ANY OTHER CONTINENT THE WORLD APART FROM ANT OUGHT TO CUT THE ECONOMIC MODEL THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION EMBODIES IS A JOB DESTROYING MISERY INDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT CREATING
TRAGEDY AND IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE WHAT WE CAN DO IS NOT JUST FOR YOURSELVES FROM THE SINKING SHIP WE CAN ALSO SEND EUROPE ENI BETTER AND MORE PROGRESSIVE DIRECTION NOW YOU MAY BE RIGHT A FORMER NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST IS NOW A PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS FOR EVERY WORLD ECONOMIC FORECASTING ORGANISATION IT COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BE A RIGHT INSTEAD THE KEY POINT IS THIS THOUGH YOU WON'T BE IN CONTROL THE PUBLIC WILL NOT BE IN CONTROL ON FRIDAY
THIS IS WITHIN THREE DAYS PEOPLE WHO MOVE MONEY WILL BE IN CONTROL IT IS A FICTION THAT YOU WILL BE IN CONTROL I THINK
THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT AT THE MOMENT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT IN CONTROL AT THE MOMENT THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ORGANISATIONS LIKE GOLDMAN SACHS AND OTHER BIG BANKS ARE IN CONTROL OF OUR ECONOMIC DESTINY IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS UNFAIR ONE OF THE POINTS THAT'S BEEN MADE CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT SO THEY TOOK THEIR JOBS AWAY A HUGE AMERICAN INVESTMENT BANKS EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN
NO I'M SPECIFICALLY POINTING OUT THAT THESE ORGANISATIONS SPEND MILLIONS OF POUNDS SEEKING TO RIG THE MARKET IN THEIR FAVOUR AGAINST WORKING PEOPLE
IT WAS GOLDMAN SACHS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAYING BUT GREECE COULD AND SHOULD JOIN THE EURO THEY SIGNED OFF THE CLIFF THEY WERE WRONG THEY'RE NOT JUST WRONG IN ECONOMIC TERMS WRONG ALSO IN MORAL TERMS BECAUSE THEY CONDEMNED THE PEOPLE OF GREECE ECONOMIC MISERY I WANT TO HAVE YOUR OWN WEDDING PEOPLE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE
WHO ARE AUTHORITIES ON ECONOMIC MATTERS PEOPLE WHO ARE INVESTORS IN THE CITY BUT MORE CRITICALLY PEOPLE WHO WERE MANUFACTURERS AND INVENTORS WHO THINK THAT BRITAIN'S MANUFACTURING BASE AND BRITAIN'S INGENUITY WOULD BE IN A STRONGER POSITION TO CREATE JOBS IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE I WANT TO MOVE YOU ON TO BEYOND FRIDAY YOU SAY THERE'LL BE NO ECONOMIC CRASH LOTS PEOPLE SAY THERE WILL BE BUT THEN THE NEXT THING YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IF WE LEAVE ON FRIDAY IS BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE Y. YOU ABOUT A NEW RELATIONSHIP
NOW YOU ALL WHOEVER IS PRIME MINISTER WILL GO TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE AND GERMANY AND ITALY AND YOU'LL SEE THIS WHEN WE'RE LEAVING WE WANT TO STOP PAYING ANY OF THE COSTS OF THE WHO WE WANT TO STOP HAVING FREE MOVEMENT NOW GIVE US AS GOOD A DEAL AS THE ONE WE HAVE NOW
HE'S GONNA BE IN CONTROL IN THAT SITUATION WITH THEM OR US WE'LL BE IN THE POSITION I THINK TO SECURE A BETTER DEAL THAN THE ONE THAT WE HAVE NOW SO WE PAY LESS AND WE GET A BETTER DEAL YES REALLY ABSOLUTELY BUT EVEN THOUGH THE CLOCK WILL TICK THERE'S A TWO YEAR TIMETABLE AS YOU KNOW IN WHICH IF THEY JUST SIT IT OUT WE ARE AUTOMATICALLY EJECTED FROM ME WE ARE IN CONTROL OF THAT TIMETABLE BECAUSE WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO TRICKLE THAT TO YOUR TIME TILL YOU TALK ABOUT ARTICLE FIFTY AS IT'S KNOWN
WE WOULD HAVE PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS AND I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE AN ELEMENT OF PEAK ON THE PART OF ONE OR TWO EUROCRATS BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO GO DOWN THE ROUTE THAT THEY HAVE PRESCRIBED FOR US BUT IT'S IN THE ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST OF OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS TO COME TO A GOOD DEAL WITH US AND IT'S A BLOCK AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST IF THEY WANT TO BLOT COMPETITION FROM THOSE BANKS THAT YOU APPARENTLY NOW DISLIKE
THEY'VE ALWAYS LOATHED THE CITY OF LONDON FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE ALWAYS LOATHE COMPETITION FROM OUR ADVERTISING AGENCIES AND A MARKETING SO WE KNOW THE LINE ABOUT GERMAN CARS AND FRENCH CHEESE BUT WE DON'T MAKE MONEY IN THIS COUNTRY FROM THOSE THINGS WE ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY FROM SERVICES MADE ME AND THEY WANT TO BLOCK THOSE BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE ISN'T A SINGLE MARKET IN SERVICES AS YOU KNOW WE DO VERY WELL
BECAUSE OF THE INGENUITY OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE THE TALENT IN THOSE INDUSTRIES BUT THE POINT ABOUT CARS AND AN AGRICULTURE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE THEN YOU YOU SKATE OVER IT WITH SUCH ELEGANCE BUT ACTUALLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT GERMANY SELLS ONE FIFTH OF ITS CARS IN BRITAIN
GERMAN CAR MANUFACTURERS WILLINGLY SAY TO THEIR WORKERS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE LAID OFF SO THAT I CAN INDULGE THE VANITY OF THE BROTHELS ELITE WHO WANTS TO SCORE A POLITICAL POINT OF BRITAIN MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT BUT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT ONLY COME UNDER PRESSURE FROM CAR MANUFACTURERS WILL COME UNDER PRESSURE FROM ADVERTISING AGENCIES FROM LEGAL COMPANIES FROM THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AS WOULD THE FRENCH MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ABOUT CONTROL
THEY ARE NEGOTIATING WITH US AND THE FRENCH AND THE GERMANS THE ITALIANS AND ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS WE WOULD NOT YOU MIGHT HOPE THEY WOULD GO WELL BUT YOU'RE IN NO POSITION TO SAY THEY WOULD WE DO HAVE CONTROL BECAUSE WE CAN DECIDE FIRSTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SECOND BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE HAVE FINANCIAL LEVERETT SECONDLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A BIG MARKET FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE THEY SELL MORE TO US COLLECTIVELY THEN WE SELL TO THEM AND THIRDLY THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF IS AND JOINED IN THE WAR TO FOSTER FRIENDLY CO OPERATION GOOD RELATIONS WITH ALL OF ITS NEIGHBOURS MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN THAT THERE IS A FREE TRADE AREA THAT EXTENDS FROM ICELAND
TO ISTANBUL THE ONLY COUNTRY OUTSIDE IT IS BELARUS NO ONE IS SERIOUSLY ARGUING THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE OUTSIDE THAT FREE TRADE AREA THAT TARIFF BARRIERS WOULD BE ERECTED AND BRITAIN'S MANUFACTURING GOODS WOULD BE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN I QUOTE AN ECONOMIC FORECAST YOU QUOTE ONE BACK AT ME LET'S GIVE YOU A MOMENT QUITE A SINGLE EUROPEAN LEADER OR POLITICIAN WHO AGREES WITH YOUR HIGHLY OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF THE BETTER DEAL WE GET WE WALK OUT
WE DON'T PAY THE BILLS WE REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE SINGLE MARKET WE REFUSED TO TAKE PART AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND HEY PRESTO THEY SAY WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER DEAL THAN THE ONE WE'VE GOT NOW WHO AGREES WITH JACQUES TO LAW AGREED WITH US AGREED WITH ME WHEN HE SAID BEFORE THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN CAME OUT ACTUALLY THAT IT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR BRITAIN TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN NOT ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS HE SAID HE'D BE BETTER TO BE SEPARATE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT THOUGH NOT GOING TO KNOW WHO AGREES WITH YOU ON TRADING I THINK YOU DO YOU JUST BELOW HE WAS SOMEONE WHO SPOKE WITH THE HONESTY OF HAVING LEFT OFFICE
IT'S OBVIOUSLY FOR THAT HISTORY DOCUMENTARY I DID ON THE DETAIL I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT HE'S DONE OR THINKS HE DOES NOT THINK WE BETTER FOR US HE THAT THAT THAT THAT IS WHAT HE SAID WHEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED IN THE PAST BY BY SOMEONE WHO WAS PERHAPS LESS GENTLE WITH HIM THEN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN NICKED BUT WHEN THEY WHEN THE TRUTH CAME OUT BUT MORE BROADLY THE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT CAN YOU NO SORRY FOR GUILTY JUST ON THE SPECIFIC CAN YOU NAME A SINGLE EUROPEAN LEADER WHO SAYS ANYTHING OTHER THAN BRITAIN WILL GET A WORSE DEAL IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S A DEJECTED OR IS THAT HE'S OUT OF OFFICE IF YOU TALK TO POLITICIANS WERE OUT OF OFFICE
THEY WILL OR NOT OR IF THEY WERE IN OFFICE AND OF COURSE THEY WANT BRITAIN TO STAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN NET CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR THREE DAYS TO GO THEREFORE THEY MAY TRUST THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN LEAVE CAMPAIGNER AND FORMER NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO THE LEADERS OF THE E.U. AND NICK THE THEY I HOPE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH ABOUT NEGOTIATION WHICH IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THEY GET SO MUCH MONEY FROM FROM THE U.K. DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT
SO THEY'RE GOING TO SAY PLEASE PLEASE STAY IF YOU GO IT WILL BE REALLY BAD FOR YOU BECAUSE THEY WANT THE MONEY TO CONTINUE TO FLOW THAT IS PERFECTLY RATIONAL THEY FOLLOW THE MONEY IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THEY WILL FOLLOW THE MONEY AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WOULD SEE THAT IT WAS IN THEIR INTEREST TO CUT A GOOD DEAL WITH US ON TRADE AND ANOTHER MATTER ISN'T IT GET TO THE SUBJECT THE VOTE LEAVE HAS BEEN VERY VERY KEEN FOR US TO TALK ABOUT EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION THERE YOU IT
WITH DAVID DIMBLEBY ON QUESTION TIME THE OTHER DAY YOU SAID THAT WE WOULD NOT BEGIN TO CUT IMMIGRATION INTO WE WERE FULLY OUT OF THE AND THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE WILL BE NO GREATER CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION DESPITE ALL THE RHETORIC NO GREATER CONTROL FOR FOUR YEARS IT'S NOT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WE CAN HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME HERE THAT IS CORRECT NO GREATER CONTROL
WE CAN CHANGE POLICY WITH RESPECT NON U. MIGRATION YOU COULD DO THAT NOW I MEAN YOU ARE A SENIOR MINISTER IN THE GOVERNMENT YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT IN ANY OF THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN OFFICE WHY HAVEN'T YOU WELL I'M NOT I DON'T CRITICISE ANY OTHER COLLEAGUE THERE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES O.K. TODAY'S A REFERENDUM CARE YOU'VE DONE NOTHING ELSE FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS WELL I I I LOOK AT THE RECORDS AND SEE ANY PARTICULAR CRITICISMS THAT I MAY HAVE MADE A PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I HAVE
BUT I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU AND YOUR RESEARCH AND IT THE BROADER POINT FOR THAT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MIGRATION WE'VE ARGUED FOR
A PROBE MIGRATION POLICY AND AUSTRALIAN STOP WHAT SYSTEM WHICH IS MANY HAVE POINTED OUT IN AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE NUMBER WHO SHOULD COME IN DO YOU GIVE ME BOTH IN THERE YOU SAY YOU HAVE IT OUR BARGAIN PARIS MIGRATION HAVE ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU FOR THE MANY OCCASION YOU HAVIN IT BECAUSE I'VE YOU'VE BEEN GENTLE I'VE FOR BORN TO AYE
OBJECT GERMANS EPAULETTES BUT THEY'RE A LOT I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL INTERROGATOR AND ENJOY IT ONCE YOU WANT TO MAKE I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY YOUR POINT YOU SAY YOUR PRO MIGRATION INTERRUPTED WAS THIS YOU HAVE ALSO HAD WHICH SOME MIGHT ARGUE REPRESENTS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE TO BE DO YOU WANT TO GET IMMIGRATION NET MIGRATION DOWN BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THERE AS YOU KNOW
NET MIGRATION FROM OUTSIDE EUROPE IS CURRENTLY ALMOST DOUBLE THAT INDEED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND SO IS IT NURSES YOU'D LIKE TO SEND HOME IS IT FARMWORKERS YOU WOULD LIKE TO STOP COMING HERE IS IT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RUN MOST OF OUR FOOD PROCESSING BUSINESS WHO WHO IS IT I DON'T LIKE TO
STOP COMING HERE I DO WANT TO SEND ANYONE HOME A POP DRUMMER STOP COMING UP APART FROM TWO THINGS THE ONLY PEOPLE I WANT TO SEND HOME OF THOSE WHO ARE CRIMINALS OR TERRORISTS AND PRESENCE HERE IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE PUBLIC WITH THE PEOPLE I WANT TO STOP COMING HERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CRIMINALS OR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE COMING HERE TO USE PUBLIC SERVICES WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY ON THE BROADER POINT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
THAT WAS A MANIFESTO COMMITMENT THAT WE ALL STOOD ON AS CONSERVATORS MY ARGUMENT IS THAT IF YOU VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE FIGURE IS SO YOU'RE RUNNING FOR A CHANGE THAT WILL BE THE MOST DRAMATIC CHANGE TO OUR ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC HISTORY FOR HALF A CENTURY AND A SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH IS HOW DO YOU WANT TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION GIVE YOU COULD BE IN CHARGE BY FRIDAY TENTH OF THIS POLICY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO GIVEN THAT NON EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION IS DOUBLE THE TARGET YOU'RE COMMITTED TO
TWO THINGS THERE ONE THE PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION BUT I'M GOING TO BE RUNNING ANYTHING OTHER MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ON FRIDAY I THINK HE'S WRONG BUT I WILL BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT DEBATE ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THE
I'M A STRONG START POINT SYSTEM ALLOWS THIS COUNTRY TO DECIDE EVERY YEAR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO ADMIT THE SCHOOLS THAT WE THINK OUR ECONOMY NEEDS THE NUMBER OF NEW JOBS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A NEW PEOPLE COMING HERE WE HAVE FOR NON EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION NOW AND THE FIGURES ARE DOUBLE YOUR TARGET THE POINTS SYSTEM THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN TO NON E.U. MIGRATION HAS
HAD BEEN DESIGNED IN A PARTICULAR WAY I'M NOT GOING TO CRITICISE THE WAY IN WHICH IT'S BEEN DESIGNED BECAUSE IT'S THE DON'T YOU THEY AGREE WITH STEVE HAD A LEAK BUT I DID YOU THINK BUT IN LESS THAT WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ONE THING IS CLEAR WE CAN'T CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME FROM THE E.U. THE SCENT OF THE GIMME A RELATION BUT IT'S FIFTY PER CENT OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME HERE STEVE MEAN SAYS THAT YOU KNEW THAT THAT NUMBER STEVE HILTON SAYS I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE BEFORE WE END TO COMMENT ON THIS STEVE HILTON SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TOLD THIS FOUR YEARS AGO
AS SHE KNEW KNEW AS WELL A CLOSE FRIEND OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND ALLY NOW STEVE HOME YOU WERE TOLD FOUR YEARS AGO THAT YOU COULD NOT GET TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT TARGET IF WE STAYED IN THE YOU SO DID YOU RUN FOR ELECTION ON THE BASIS OF A LOT I KNOW I DID NOT I
BELIEVED AND HOPED THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE A DEAL WITH EUROPE WHICH WOULD ENABLE US TO AMEND FREE MOVEMENT AND EVEN NOW A HOPE NOT ALIVE ONE WING AND A PRAYER MAYBE NO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO STRESS IS THAT I HAVE
CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THAT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION I SPECIFICALLY ARGUED THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION BY FUNDAMENTALLY REFORMING NOTCHED A RELATIONSHIP THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF DURING THE RENEGOTIATION I HOPED AND PRAYED THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE ABLE TO BRING ABOUT THAT CHANGE
HE WASN'T AND I DON'T BLAME HIM I DO BLAME THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE FINAL WHAT THAT CHANGE HAS NOT COME ABOUT I WAS COMPELLED RELUCTANTLY TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ONLY WAY NOT JUST THAT WE COULD CONTROL MIGRATION BUT THAT WE COULD RESTORE OUR DEMOCRACY WAS BY LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THAT
THE POINT YOU MAKE ABOUT NUMBERS AND THE POINT YOU MAKE ABOUT BAD FAITH PEOPLE WILL DRAW THEIR OWN CONCRETE LET ME ASK YOU WHAT ABOUT YOU FINALLY I DRAW FROM IS BUT MAKING PROMISES AND THEN SADDLING YOURSELF WITH THE POLITICAL
SYSTEM IN A POLITICAL UNION IT MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT DELIVER THOSE PROMISES I FEAR DOESN'T CONTRIBUTE TO AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE O.K. SIX AND THAT'S WHY WITH LET ME ASK ABOUT TRUST AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF THE WITCH TO LEAVE AND TOOK THAT CONTROL FINAL QUESTION BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD ABOUT TRUST AND CONFIDENCE YOU MADE CLEAR
WE CANNOT MEET YOU AS A GOVERNMENT CANNOT MEET ITS IMMIGRATION PROMISE IF WE STAY IN THE E.U. YES YOU'VE ALSO TOLD THE COUNTRY WE CAN'T BLOCK CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS IF WE STAY IN THE E.U. WE CAN'T RELEASE THE FUNDS NEEDED FOR THE N.H.S. SO PRESUMABLY IF THE COUNTRY VOTES TO REMAIN IN YOU WITH ALL CONSCIENCE ALL MORALITY MUST QUIT THE GOVERNMENT
I WILL DO EXACTLY AS THE PRIME MINISTER OFFAL IS YOUR CONSCIENCE SHOT YOU'VE SAID WE DON'T MEET ANY THESE PROMISES YOU NEED TO GET OUT I WANT PEOPLE TO CONCENTRATE NOT ON MY JOB PUT ON THEIR JOBS OF COURSE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE RESULT IS ON FRIDAY I WILL REFLECT AND I WILL DECIDE WHAT IS THE BEST COURSE FOR ME MICHAEL I WANT PEOPLE WHEN THEY CAST THEIR VOTE ON THURSDAY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE FATE OF INDIVIDUAL POLITICIANS WHETHER THEY LIKE THEM OR DISLIKE THEM
BUT TO THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES TO THE TRUST THEMSELVES TO GOVERN AND TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY OR DO THEY WANT THE FUTURE THIS COUNTRY DECIDED BY UNELECTED OFFICIALS WHOSE NAMES THEY DON'T KNOW WHOM THEY CANNOT KICK OUT LIKE O.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TAKE THAT CONTROL

USED TO BRING DOWN MIGRATION BUT THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED
GEORGE SOROS THE INVESTOR WHO MADE A BILLION DOLLARS BY BETTING AGAINST THE POUND ON BLACK WEDNESDAY IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HAS WARNED OF A BLACK FRIDAY IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. ON THURSDAY HE SAYS THAT STERLING WOULD DROP IN VALUE BY AT LEAST FIFTEEN PERCENT

THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE OTHER NATIONS DOCTORS CHANGING THEIR VIEW OF ASSISTED DYING M.P.S OF COURSE REJECTED CHANGE IN THE LAW LAST YEAR THEY B.M.A. THE DOCTORS' UNION IS OFFICIALLY AGAINST ASSISTED DYING BUT IT'S CONFERENCE TODAY IN BELFAST THERE IS A MOTION FOR DISCUSSION THAT SUGGESTS SOME CHANGE OF VIEW AT LEAST AMONG SOME DOCTORS THE MOTION SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S A CHANGE OF POLICY FROM
OPPOSITION TO A NEUTRAL STANCE LET'S TALK TO DOCTOR CLARE JERADO PAST PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S MEMBER ELECTED THE B.M.A. COUNCIL IS GOING TO SPEAK TO US IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY AND BARONESS FINLAY AS WELL CROSS BENCH PEER CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL PALLIATIVE CARE WHO WAS ALSO PRESENT WOULD BE M.A. A YEAR OR SO AGO BUT THE MONITOR YOU BOTH FIRST HOLDING GOOD MORNING DOCTOR GERRARD OR DID DO YOU SENSE
WHAT IS BEHIND WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY IS A REAL CHANGE OF MIND BY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF DOCTORS
WELL THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR IS FOR THE B.M.A. TO HOLD A NEUTRAL POSITION SO NEITHER BE OPPOSED OR IN FAVOUR OF ASSISTED DYING THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT THE B.M.A. BIG MEETING WHICH HOLES ONCE A YEAR SEVERAL TIMES AND
EACH TIME IT'S BEEN FELT THAT IT IT SHOULDN'T HOLD A NEUTRAL POSITION MY VIEW IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY IS THAT THAT IS THE ONLY FAIR AND HONEST VIEW THAT ANY LARGE MEDICAL ORGANISATION INCLUDING THE ONE THAT I LEAD THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S SHOULD HOLD BECAUSE
IF WE DON'T HOLD A NEUTRAL POSITION IT MEANS WE'RE PUTTING WITH TRUMPING THE MAN ON THE CLAPHAM OMNIBUS IT MEANS WE'RE BRINGING HER AS A COLLECTIVE AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE COLLECTIVE DOCTORS WITHIN THAT COLLECTIVE HOLD THE SAME VIEW I THINK IT'S NOT A SAFE VIEW TO HAVE IT DOESN'T MEAN JUST IN THAT WE CAN'T INDIVIDUALLY
USE OUR EXPERTISE AND SKILLS IN LAW AND MYSELF BOTH WORK WITH THE DYING TO INFLUENCE THE DEBATE AND TO LOBBY AND TO TALK TO POLITICIANS AND TO TRY AND INFLUENCE THE DEBATE BUT COLLECTIVELY THE B.M.A. REPRESENTS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCTORS TO CLAIM THAT IT SPEAKS WITH A SINGLE VOICE I THINK IS DISINGENUOUS AND THE ONLY SAFE YOU CAN HOLD IS A NEUTRAL POSITION AND LAURA FINLAY
DOCTORS CAN'T BE NEUTRAL ON SOMETHING THAT GOES TO THE VERY CORE OF MEDICAL PRACTICE THIS WOULD AFFECT EVERY DOCTOR WORKING CLINICALLY AND THEY WOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN ASSESSING WHOSE LIFE
IS WORTH WORKING HARD FOR AND WHO SHOULD BE GIVEN EQUAL DRUGS THAT GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT THEY DO DAY IN DAY OUT THEY CANNOT BE ASKED TO NOT HOLD TO VIEW THE B.M.A. HAS JUST FINISHED AN EIGHTEEN MONTH CONSULTATION WITH THE PUBLIC AND WITH DOCTORS
AND INTERESTINGLY THEY FOUND THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPORT DROPPED RIGHT BACK WHEN THE PUBLIC UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS INVOLVED AND THE DOCTORS DIDN'T SUPPORTED AND CLAIRE'S OWN COLLEGE DID THE LARGEST CONSULTATION IT IS EVER UNDERTAKEN WITH SEVENTEEN THOUSAND RESPONSES AND THEY SAID NO WE DON'T WANT TO GO NEUTRAL THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS DID THE SAME
AND MY OWN PROFESSIONAL GROUP IN PATENT MEDICINE HAVE SET NO THIS AFFECTS US AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE GOOD BUT AFFECT YOU HOW DO YOU JUST BEFORE I COME BACK TO YOU CADGE A RATHER A WOODEN ILORA FINLAY WHAT WHEN YOU SAY GO NEUTRAL I MEAN IT WOULD BE THE OFFICIAL POSITION
OF THE B.M.A. ANN AN INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR COULD STILL TAKE THE SAME VIEW WOULD STILL TAKE THE SAME VIEW OF IT THAT THEY TOOK THAT THEY TAKE TODAY AND THAT VIEW WILL BE DIVIDED BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL DOT NO BECAUSE THE THIS INVOLVES TWO PEOPLE THE PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR'S BEING ASKED TO ASSESS WHETHER SOMEBODY SHOULD BE GIVEN LEE FOR DRUGS AND THEN TO SUPPLY THEM AND CARRY THE CAN FOR ALL THE PROCESSES INVOLVED THAT'S WHY THEY ALSO HAVE A FEW
NOW THIS TALK OF GANG NEUTRAL IS REALLY TO CREATE THE HEADLINE OLD DOCTORS HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND THEN TRY TO PUSH AGAINST PARLIAMENT HAS SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY BOTH IN WESTMINSTER AND IN SOME OF THAT IN A WAY HAD TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION TO START OFF WHATEVER THIS WAS ABOUT A KIND OF SHIFT IN THE WAY
DOCTORS ARE FEELING BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT AND WOULD THIS WOULD THIS CHANGE ALONE SUGGEST TO PEOPLE INFLUENCE THE DEBATE IN A WAY THAT PUSHED IT IN ONE DIRECTION HERE OR JUST TO CORRECT IT OR IT WASN'T AS LARGE A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND AND ACTUALLY THE DEBATE WHICH I LED SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU ARE NOT ASKED BORED SO BORED SAINT G.P.S ON BOARD THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE OPPOSED TO A NEUTRAL BUT WHEN YOU'VE SURVEYED THEM PRIVATELY IN ANONYMOUSLY
THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO WANT A NEUTRAL POSITION TO ITS VERY COMPLEX MY SENSES OF COURSE ARE LAURA'S RIGHT OF COURSE DOCTORS HAVE TO BE THERE IF WE DO HAVE ASSISTED DYING TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE FOR PATIENTS TO ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN WELL REHEARSED OF COURSE IT'S IMPORTANT
JUST LIKE WE DO WHEN WE DO TERMINATIONS OF PREGNANCY BUT IT IS NOT THE CUT WHAT I ARGUE IS THAT MANY ASKED ALSO DO IS THAT IT IS PATRONISING IT'S AGAINST ALL THE WISHES OF PATIENTS AGAINST THOSE THAT WHEN THEY'RE SURVEYED THE DISABLED RELIGIOUS GROUPS
TO SAY THAT DOCTORS SHOULD BE OPPOSED TO ASSISTED DYING BECAUSE ACTUALLY IT'S NOT TRUE WE NEED TO IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY
SURVEY EVERY DOCTOR AND ACTUALLY THEN BE QUITE CLEAR THIS DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO URGE THIS DID DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE AGAINST PALLIATIVE CARE THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COERCING PATIENTS AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DOCTORS CANNOT USE THEIR EXPERTISE
INDIVIDUALLY TO AFFECT THE DELAY IF THEY WERE JUST BE HONEST WOULDN'T IT BECAUSE DOCTORS ARE SPLIT AND PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ALONG THE MIDDLE THERE IS A NEUTRAL POINT OF VIEW THAT FAIRLY SAYS WELL WE DON'T HAVE A DISTINCT POSITION AS DOCTORS WE HAVE A RANGE OF VIEWS JUST LIKE THE PUBLIC DID WELL WELL OF COURSE THERE'S A RANGE OF IS JUST LIKE THE PUBLIC TO BUT WHERE THE POLICY YOU HAVE TO EITHER HAVE IT OR NOT HAVE IT YOU ARE THE PASS THE LAW OR YOU DON'T I'M SORRY IT'S IT'S SEVENTEEN HUNDRED NOT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND I BEG YOUR PARDON WITH THAT FIGURE

CAROLINE BARKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE ANYONE WHO'S READ FREDERICK FORSYTH'S THRILLER THE DAY OF THE JACKAL OR INDEED SEEN THE FILM WILL KNOW THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER TOOK THE IDENTITY OF A DEAD CHILD IN RECENT YEARS IT'S EMERGED THAT THIS WAS A TACTIC ADOPTED BY SOME UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND
ON WEDNESDAY THERE JUDGE IT BACK TOMORROW THE JUDGE WHO'S CHAIRING THE INQUIRY INTO UNDERCOVER POLICING IS GOING TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO DISCLOSE TO THE PARENTS OF THE DEAD CHILD THAT THEIR CHILD'S IDENTITY HAS BEEN USED BY THE POLICE OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DUE KEVIN REPORT
I'M IN STRESS IN A CEMETERY IN SOUTH LONDON AND BURIED HERE IS A BABY BOY ROD RICHARDSON WHO WAS BORN AND DIED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
NOW IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SO FORTY YEARS LATER ROD'S MOTHER LEARNED THAT IT APPEARED THAT AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER HAD USED HER BABY'S NAME TO CREATE A FALSE IDENTITY
ROD HAD A VERY SHORT LIFE HE SURVIVED JUST
HEARD THE BABY IT WAS FINE
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME BECAUSE THEY SAID HE'S GOT TO GO AND INCUBATE HER BECAUSE HE WAS UNDERWAY
ROD'S MOTHER BARBARA SURE THOUGHT HER NEW SON JUST NEEDED TO PUT ON SOME WEIGHT BUT TWO DAYS AFTER HE WAS BORN SHE WAS TOLD HER BABY HAD DIED SUDDENLY
SIX YEARS AGO DETAILS BEGAN TO EMERGE OF THE TACTICS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FOR YEARS BY UNDERCOVER OFFICERS SOME HAD DUPED WOMEN INTO LONG TERM PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS SOME HAD TAKEN THE NAMES OF DEAD CHILDREN AS THEY TRIED TO BUILD WHAT THEY CALLED THEIR LEGEND IN OTHER WORDS THEIR BACK STORY THESE WERE THE SECRET POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAD INFILTRATED PROTEST GROUPS
AND ON THE STREETS AMONGST THE OFFICERS MASQUERADING AS POLITICAL ACTIVISTS WAS A MAN WHO CALLED HIMSELF ROD RICHARDSON
THE SAME NAME AS BARBARA SURE SON AND HE HAS USED HER CHARLES DATE OF BIRTH HOWEVER SHE SAYS THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HASN'T CONFIRMED THAT HER SON'S IDENTITY WAS TAKEN SHE'S CLEAR ABOUT WHAT SHE WANTS FROM THE FORCE AND APOLOGY A PROPER APOLOGY
CONFIRMED THAT WHAT THEY'VE DONE AN EXCLAMATION
THEREFORE I WANT REALLY SO FAR IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE IDENTITIES OF FORTY TWO DEAD CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WE USED A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN'S NAMES HAVE EMERGED BUT MANY PARENTS WHO LOST CHILDREN AND PAST DECADES HAVE BEEN LEFT WONDERING THIS IS BENJAMIN HE SAYS YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE IN THE PICTURE
USE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOYS YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE AND PERFECTLY FORMED IN EVERY WAY GORDON PETER SON BENJAMIN LIVE FOR JUST A WEEK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND HIS MOTHER AND I NURSED HIM THROUGH THAT WEEK BUT WE LEARNED THAT HE WAS NEVER LIKELY TO SURVIVE AND IN FACT HE DID DIE AFTER SEVEN DAYS
LAWYERS FOR GORDON PETERS AND BARBARA SHAW WILL BE ARGUING BEFORE LORD JUSTICE PITCH WOULD THE JUDGE WHO'S CHAIRING THE INQUIRY INTO UNDERCOVER POLICING THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE TOLD WHETHER AND WHY THEIR CHILD'S NAME WAS USED
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE HAS APOLOGISED FOR THE HURT CAUSED BY THE PRACTICE BUT IT HAS A POLICY OF NEITHER CONFIRMING OR DENYING WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHETHER THE NAME OF A PARTICULAR CHILD WAS USED GORDON PETERS BELIEVES THIS APPROACH IS UNSUSTAINABLE THERE NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY POLICY WHICH THE POLICE AND SYSTEM MAINTAINING
SEEMS TO ME AND ABROGATION OF BASIC RIGHT
MAKES ONE FEEL THAT
OUR RATES ARE SECONDARY TO THOSE OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF LAW AND ORDER WHO SEEM TO WANT TO DECIDE WHEN WE SHOULD KNOW THINGS AND WHEN WE SHOULDN'T KNOW THINGS
THE MET SAYS THAT HE'S AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER WHO'S USED TO DEAD CHARLES IDENTITY HIS NAME TO THE FORTHCOMING INQUIRY THEN WE'LL EXPLAIN AND APOLOGISE TO THE FAMILY INVOLVED BUT MANY OFFICERS HAVE ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND THE JUDGE WILL DECIDE IN THE CASE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL OFFICER WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS THE MET ARE STRESSING THAT THE PRACTICE OF TAKING IDENTITIES HAS STOPPED
AS A BEREAVED MOTHER BARBARA SURE BELIEVES THE SECRET POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF WHAT THEY DID THEY SHOULD ALL BE DISCUSSING WITH US
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT YOU SEE THE BERNINI OF IT THE BABY'S RESTING PLACE THERE WAS GENE KELLY REPORTING TALK TO JULES CAREY WHO IS A LAWYER AND BIND THE LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS SOME OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND WHAT DO YOU WANT THE JUDGE TO SAY
THE JUDGE HAS TO FIRSTLY DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A DUTY ON THE STATE TO DISCLOSE THE DISCO'S MOTHER NOT CHILDREN'S DETAILS WERE USED IN THIS WAY AND IF HE DECIDED THAT WHAT WOULD IT INVOLVE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARRY OUT A BALANCING ACT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IN EACH PARTICULAR CASE THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD BE NOTIFIED WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE DEAD CHARLES DETAILS WERE USED
WHAT I SHOULD SAY IS THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE BROUGHT INTO THIS INQUIRY
BUT SO FAR APPROXIMATELY ONLY TWELVE OF THEM HAVE APPLIED FOR WHAT'S CALLED A RESTRICTION ORDER TO PREVENT THEIR DETAILS BEING PUBLICLY DISCLOSED SO THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION IS THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THE COVER NAMES WILL BE DISCLOSED AND IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE THE DEAD CHILDREN'S DETAILS WERE USED TO PHONE COVER NAMES THE FAMILIES WILL BE SENSITIVELY NOTIFIED
SHE WHAT BERNARD HEARD AND HOW HER SAID FROM METROPOLITAN POLICE SAID IS ACTUALLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO HE'S SENT IT WAS NEVER INTENDED OR FOR SCENE THAT ANY OF THE IDENTITIES USED WOULD BECOME PUBLIC
HE MAY WELL HAVE SAID THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT REASONABLE GROUNDS WHO'D HAVE ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT IN EVEN IN MANY CRIMINAL CASES AND DETAILS OF UNDERCOVER OPERATION TO MAKE PUBLIC THAT I DON'T THINK ANY INDIVIDUAL OFFICER WOULD HAVE HAD AN EXPECTATION THAT FOR ALL TIME IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THE IDENTITIES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REVEALED HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT
THAT THERE IS FULL DISCLOSURE NOW IN OTHER WORDS ONE CAN IMAGINE IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES PEOPLE SAYING
I'D RATHER NOT KNOW BUT OTHERS THINK VERY KEEN TO KNOW AMONG THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT WHAT IS THERE WHAT IS THE THING THAT IS DRIVING THEM AND DRIVING THEM TO ASK YOU TO DO THE WORK ORDER
THERE'S TWO THINGS THE FIRST THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT THIS ISN'T THE INQUIRY ISN'T LOOKING INTO THE POLICING OF ORGANISED CRIMINAL GANGS IS LOOKING AT THE INFILTRATION OF POLITICAL GROUPS AND ORGANISATIONS AND ACTIVISTS AND THAT UNDERCOVER OFFICERS WERE INFILTRATING THOSE GROUPS IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC CONCERN WHICH IS QUITE A PUBLIC INQUIRY WAS SET UP TO LOOK AT THIS
BUT MOST OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO I REPRESENT SIMPLY WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICISED BOTH BY THE HAMMER FIRST FLICK COMMITTEE WHO DESCRIBED AS GHOULISH AND DISRESPECTFUL AND THE HOME SECRETARY HUGH WHEN SHE SET UP AN INQUIRY INDICATED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD FACE DISCIPLINE YOUR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS FOR THIS PRACTICE
HOW THIS CAME ABOUT AND HOW HIGH UP THE RANKS IT WAS AUTHORISED IT WAS STANDARD PRACTICE IN ONE UNIT THE SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION SQUAD BETWEEN NINETY BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT IN THE END IT WAS BANNED AND POST ON ETHICAL GROUNDS AND ON THE BASIS THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A RISK THAT AN OFFICER WOULD IN THE END WHO PROVIDED WITH A COPY OF HIS OWN DEATH CERTIFICATE SO THE PRACTICE ITSELF WAS NEITHER ETHICAL OR
PRACTICAL BUT EVERYONE EXCEPT THAT NOW I JUST WONDER WHAT MORE CAN BE GOT FOR THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT
THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT AS YOU HEARD THE CONTRIBUTORS THEY SAID THAT FOR SOME OF THEM THEY SIMPLY WANT TO KNOW THEY THEY THEY SAY THEY HAVE VERY SHORT MEMORIES VERY FEW MEMORIES OF THEIR DEAD CHILD AND THE ONES THAT THEY HAVE NOW UTTERLY CONTAMINATED BY THE THOUGHT
BUT THEIR DEAD CHILD WOULD MEMORY OF THAT HER CHILD WAS GIVEN LIFE THEY WAS ROAMING AROUND AND ENGAGED IN SORT OF CERTAIN AXE AND IT WASN'T AT THE OFFICER'S JUST BORROWED THE NAME AND THE DATE
THEY WENT TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND VILLAGES THEY WORKED OUT WHAT THE JOBS OF THE PARENTS WERE THEY CREATED AN ENTIRE LEGEND AROUND THE PERSON SO THAT THE PARENTS I MEAN ONE WHISTLEBLOWER POLICE OFFICER PETER FRANCIS SAID THAT THE IDENTITY HE ADOPTED HE NOTED THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN THE ARMY
AND SO PART OF HIS COVER STORY WAS THAT HE WAS REGULARLY BEATEN BY HIS FATHER AND THEY WOULD GO TO THE SCHOOLS AND THE LOCAL PARKS AND THEY CREATED AN ENTIRE FICTIONAL CHARACTER AND THAT IS THAT'S A SOURCE OF BEWILDERMENT AND DISCUSSED FOR MY MEAT FOR AND HAS WON IT WE REPRESENT HE CONSTRUCTED NOW JOE'S CAREY FROM VIOLENCE THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU
SIX MINUTES TO NINE WOMEN AS WE KNOW PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN WORLD WAR ONE MANY OF THEM WORKING IN THE FACTORIES THAT SUPPLIED THE FRONT LINE ONE GROUP OF THEM THE CIRCLE BOMBO LASSES PAID A TERRIBLE PRICE
WHEN THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION IN THEIR MUNITIONS FACTORY IN LEEDS A CENTURY AGO WELL THEY ARE BEING REMEMBERED IN A NEW PLAY WHICH OPENS AT THE WEST YORKSHIRE PLAYHOUSE TONIGHT
WELL THAT IS A SOUND OF THE NEW PLAY THE DIRECTOR OF IT KATE WHAT'S A BIRD JOINS US FROM LEEDS AS DOES JACKIE LAWRENCE FROM THE EAST LEADS HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY SOCIETY MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU GOOD MORNING KATE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS STORY OF A HUGE HUGE MUNITIONS FACTORY THAT INSPIRED YOU INSPIRED THE PLAYWRIGHT TO THINK IT WAS WORTH PUTTING ON THE STAGE
I THINK THE FACT THAT IT'S A STORY THAT'S BEEN LARGELY I'M TOLD FOR THE LAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HELP US WIN WORLD WAR ONE AND BECAUSE THEY WERE WOMEN POOR WOMEN THEIR STORY WAS LARGELY IGNORE DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE LOSS OF LIFE IN LEEDS
THIRTY FIVE SO CALLED MUNITION NETS KILLED IN ONE EXPLOSION YEAH THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TOTAL OF FORTY I THINK OVER THERE FOR THE FIRST WORLD WAR BUT THERE WAS A SINGLE EXPLOSION WHICH IS THAT'S THE TIME PERIOD THAT THE PLAY LOOKS THAT BUT KILL THIRTY FIVE WOMEN AND JACKIE ALTHOUGH YOU KNEW ABOUT THE FACTORY OF COURSE SHE DID GROWING UP IN LEEDS THE ACCIDENT WAS HUSHED UP WAS IN
YES IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE YOU KNOW THE POWERS THAT BE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM WITH WITH MORALE IF IF THE IF THE INFORMATION WAS WHEN MADE AVAILABLE TO WHEN YOU BEGAN RESEARCHING IT A FEW YEARS AGO WERE YOU WERE YOU SHOCKED
YES I WAS I WAS SHOCKED WHAT REALLY CAME ACROSS TO ME WAS THAT THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE BECAUSE WE STARTED SPEAKING TO RELATIVES OF THE GIRLS WHO WERE INVOLVED
SO WE GOT THE REAL STORIES AND THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE AND
IMPORTANT I THINK REALLY WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HEAR THAT HE'S REAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND CAKE THAT EXTRA WE HAVE IN THE PLAY SOUNDS ALL VERY JOLLY BUT THIS WAS A GRIM GRIM HER LIFE FOR MANY OF THE WOMEN YOUNG WOMEN WORKING IN THESE FACTORIES EVEN IF THEY SURVIVED EXPLOSIONS THEY WERE TERRIBLE RISKS IN OTHER WAYS THEY WERE TOGETHER T.N.T. THEY HANDLED WAS HIGHLY POISONOUS SO THEY TURNED YELLOW THEY WERE CALLED THE BOMBAY CANARIES IN THE PLACE CALLED THE BOMBAY CANARIES THEY TURNED YELLOW BECAUSE THEY WERE INGESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF POISON
THAT SAID THEY WERE REALLY TOUGH AND THEY WORKED REALLY HARD AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE PLAY REALLY CELEBRATES IS THAT FOR THEM THIS WAS A HUGE NEW FOUND FREEDOM THEY WERE MAKING MORE MONEY THAN THEY'D EVER ANY OF THEM HAD EVER SEEN IN THEIR LIVES THEY SUDDENLY HAD INDEPENDENTS AND MONEY IN THEIR POCKET THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO OUT BY THEMSELVES AND A LOT OF THEM WERE VERY YOUNG SO IT'S ALSO ALMOST THE BEGINNING OF THE BIRTH OF THE TEENAGER THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE PLAY HAS A LOT OF FUN WITH AND JACKIE WHEN YOU DID SPEAK TO RELATIVES
PEOPLE WITH SOME DISTANT MEMORIES OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT WAS THIS STILL ANGER THEIR ANGER AT THE WAY THE FACTORY HAD BEEN RUN ANGER AT THE SMALL AMOUNTS OF COMPENSATION THE PEOPLE GOD IF THEY LOST A RELATIVE OR INDEED THEY WERE INJURED THEMSELVES THERE WAS SOME OF THAT BUT I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT CAME ACROSS TO US WAS THE PRIDE THAT PEOPLE HAD IN WHAT THE RELATIVES HAD DONE
PRY BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING YES YES AND INDEED THEY WERE THAT I THINK THAT WAS THE OVERRIDING EMOTION OF THE GIRLS THAT THEY WERE
THEY WERE VERY PATRIOTIC AND THEY WERE WANTING TO SORT OF PART OF THE MEN WHO WERE AT THE FRONT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE FAMILIES WERE REALLY PROUD OF IT IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER I MEAN I DON'T REMEMBER OF COURSE BUT IT'S HARD TO TAKE IN THE SHEER SCALE OF THIS I WAS READING THAT THIS FACTORY COVERED TWO HUNDRED ACRES AND PRODUCED TEN THOUSAND SHELLS A WEEK AT ONE STAGE YES IN FACT IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED ACRES
YES IT WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT YEAH IT WAS HUGE IT WAS WHEN IT WAS BUILT IT WAS THE LARGEST MUNITIONS FACTORY IN EUROPE
SO KATE WHAT PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE PLAY WILL GET IS NOT MERELY AS IT WERE COMMEMORATING AN AWFUL TRAGEDY BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THESE WOMEN WERE EMPOWERED ABSOLUTELY YEAH THIS IS A STORY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN DESTINY FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND ALTHOUGH OF COURSE AFTER THE WAR WOMEN WORSE ALONG BACK INTO THEIR HOME AND WEREN'T GIVEN CERTAINLY WORKING CLASS WOMEN WEREN'T GIVEN THE VOTE AS THEY WERE PROMISED IT WAS THE BIRTH OF THAT UNDERSTANDING AND I THINK EVENTUALLY LEADS TO
MODERN FEMINISM THAT THESE WOMEN SUDDENLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY COULD DO ANYTHING THAT A MAN COULD DO AN EIGHT HELP TO WIN THE WAR AND THEY DESERVE THEIR PLACE IN SOCIETY RATHER BRIEFLY IF YOU WILL KATE YOU DECIDED TO BRING IN A COMMUNITY CHORUS ALONGSIDE THE PROFESSIONALS YEAH THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE WOMEN OF LEEDS AND WE THOUGHT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY WERE REPRESENTED ON THE STAGE SO WE HAVE A GROUP OF FORTY ONE WOMEN WHO PERFORM IN TWO TEAMS AND THEY ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SHOW GO IN ALMOST EVERY SCENE AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SO WE CAN GO TO THE WEST YORKSHIRE PLAYHOUSE TONIGHT
