I'LL START WITH ENGLAND IT'S DRYING COLD TO BEGIN WITH ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST AND EAST BUT WET AND BREEZY IN THE NORTH AND WEST WITH SOME HEAVY BURSTS OF RAIN MAKING FOR SOME PRETTY HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS ON THE ROADS FOR THE MORNING OUR RUSH HOUR COMMUTE THE STANDING WATER AND SPRAY SLEET AND SNOW WILL FALL OVER THE HILLS ESPECIALLY OF THE PENNINES
BUT THEN ALSO ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDLANDS INTO YORKSHIRE AND EAST AND EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WE HEAD ON TOWARDS THE MIDDLE PART OF THE DAY THE SOUTH EAST THERE REMAIN DRY FOR MUCH OF THE DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE THIS MORNING WITH RAIN ARRIVING HERE LATER ON IN THE DAY IT WILL FEEL QUITE COLD FOR MOST ESPECIALLY IN THE RAIN WITH HIGHS OF FOUR TO EIGHT CELSIUS
FOR WALES AND WE'VE GOT A CLOUDY WET MORNING SOME HEAVY BURSTS OF RAIN AND SNOW ON THE HILLS AGAIN MAKING FOR SIMPLY HAD THIS ROW CONDITIONS THIS MORNING IT WILL BE PRETTY CLOUDY AND WET ALL DAY WITH RAIN SLOWLY CLEARING FROM THE WEST AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE AFTERNOON IT'LL FEEL CHILLY FOR ALL FIVE TO EIGHT CELSIUS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AFTER A WET NIGHT WITH SNOW ON THE HILLS RAIN WILL CLEAR THE BELFAST AREA VERY SOON AND THEN WE'LL SEE A RISK OF ICE IN THE WEST BRIEFLY HOWEVER WE'RE LOOKING AT A FINE MAINLY DRY AND BRIGHT DAY WITH SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE JUST A FEW SHOWERS IN THE WEST AND TEMPERATURES ARE FIVE TO SIX CELSIUS
FOR SCOTLAND AFTER A VERY WET TWENTY FOUR HOURS ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE WEST TODAY LOOKS A LITTLE BIT BETTER DRY AND BRIGHTER ONCE THE MORNING RAIN AND HILL SNOW CLEARS AWAY SO BY THE AFTERNOON YOU'LL BE BRIGHTER WITH SOME SUNSHINE ALSO A FEW SHOWERS IN THE WEST SOME OF THEM COULD BE QUITE HEAVY IN MODERATE SOUTH WEST WINDS TEMPERATURES ARE RICH HIGHS OF FOUR TO SIX CELSIUS THAT'S YOUR WEATHER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND AHEAD OF THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT THE BEGINS TOMORROW NIGHT IN BRUSSELS THERE IS LOTS OF ATTENTION TO THE POINTS OF THE DRAFT AGREEMENT THAT COULD PROVE MOST PROBLEMATIC FOR DAVID CAMERON TO GET AGREEMENT FROM THE OTHER E.U. LEADERS ON THE INDEPENDENT AND THE GUARDIAN ARE BOTH FOCUSING ON DEMAND FROM EASTERN EUROPEAN LEADERS THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THEY'RE DEMANDING THAT
DAVID CAMERON WATER DOWN KEY DEMANDS FOR RESTRICTIONS ON MIGRANT BENEFITS AS THEIR PRICE FOR SIGNING UP TO HIS WIDER E.U. RENEGOTIATION A PACKAGE AND DONALD TUSKER SAYS THE GUARDIAN FORMER POLISH PRIME MINISTER IS IN CHARGE OF BROKERING THE DEAL AS THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT SAYS THAT IT'S CLEAR E.U. LEADERS WILL HAVE TO GO AN EXTRA MILE TO REACH AGREEMENT HE WAS SPEAKING OUT AFTER POLAND SLOVAKIA HUNGARY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC REACHED A COMMON POSITION ON REJECTING THE PROPOSALS ON CURBING CHILD BENEFIT
ALL THE PAPERS PICK UP ON WHAT PRINCE WILLIAM SAID YESTERDAY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS ITS LEAD ITS HEADLINE PRINCE WILLIAM DRAWN INTO THE ROW BECAUSE HE IS HAS BEEN ACCUSED IN THE WORDS OF THE MALE OF BACKING THE PRO Y. YOU CAMPAIGN WE DID HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY MENTION THE WORD EUROPE AND THAT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY HIS ADVISORS AND HIS CAMP BUT HE DID SAY RIGHT NOW THE BIG QUESTIONS IN THE U.N. NATO THE MIDDLE EAST AND ELSEWHERE ARE PREDICATED ON WORKING ON
ARE NOW WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHERS SOMEBODY ELSE HAS BEEN TORN INTO THE ROW IS EMMA THOMPSON WHO'S ON THE FRONT OF THE MAIL AND THE SUN THE SUN GIVES OVER RAMPAGED TO TELLING HER TO SHUT YOUR CAKE HOLE BECAUSE SHE REFERRED TO THE U.K. AS A CAKE FILLED MISERY LADEN GREY OLD ISLANDERS SHE WAS SAYING THAT THE U.K. WILL BE MAD TO LEAVE IT
AND ACROSS THE PAPERS THEY'RE PICKING UP ON THE STORY FROM ANTI SUGAR CAMPAIGNERS WHO ARE TARGETING THE SORTS OF THINGS NOT FIZZY DRINKS BUT THE SORT OF THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BUY IN A COFFEE SHOP LIKE STARBUCKS COSTA WHEN YOU TREAT YOURSELF TO A CREAMY HOT CHOCOLATE OR A SPICY MULLED
DRINK SAYS THE DAILY MAIL YOU'LL KNOW THEY'LL CONTAIN A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUGAR BUT YOU MIGHT BE SHOCKED IF YOU REALISED HOW MUCH AS IN SOME TRENDY SPECIALITY HOT DRINKS SOLD BY HIGH STREET CHAINS THE WORST OFFENDER APPARENTLY THIS IS BASED ON A LARGE SERVING BUT THE WORST OFFENDER IS THE HOT MULLED FRUIT GRAPE WITH CHILD ORANGE AND CINNAMON THAT YOU WOULD GET IN STARBUCKS IF YOU CHOSE THE VENTI SIZE THE BIGGER SIZE YOU'D HAVE NINETY NINE GRAMS OF SUGAR IN IT WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS
MORE THAN SOME THROUGH THE DRINKS WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE PERSON WHO DID THAT RESEARCH A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND GREECE HAS OPENED FOUR OF FIVE CENTRES OR HOT SPOTS FOR PROCESSING MIGRANTS WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY JAMES REYNOLDS IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN ATHENS AND JAMES THESE HAVE SORT OF LONG BEEN PROMISED BY GREECE HAVEN'T THEY DID AS A WAY OF DEALING WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS
THE HOT SPOT IS GREECE'S ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CHECKING AND SCREENING ALL OF THE MIGRANTS COMING IN BECAUSE THE E.U. HAS MADE IT CLEAR TO GREET YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK EVERYONE YOU'VE GOT TO SCREEN OVER ONCE AGREED TO SET UP THESE HOTSPOTS
PEOPLE WILL BE TAKEN THERE AND THEN THEY'LL BE CLASSIFIED THAT REGISTERED AND PUT EM FINGERPRINTED THOSE DEEMED TO BE REFUGEES WILL GET TO MOVE ON TO THE REST OF EUROPE THOSE DEEMED TO BE ECONOMIC MIGRANTS WILL HAVE TO STOP THEIR JOURNEYS AND MAY EVENTUALLY BE DEPORTED IT'S HIS WAY OF SHOWING IT HE'S TAKEN CONTROL OF ITS BORDERS RIGHT THESE SO THESE HOT EAT HOTSPOT IS LARGE I MEAN IS IT LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD MANY PEOPLE IF THEY'D IS DEEMED AS BEING PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE DEPORTED
IT'S NOT YET CLEAR WE UNDERSTAND THE FIVE HOTSPOTS HAVE A TOTAL CAPACITY OF ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND BUT I THINK VERY CLEARLY YOU KEEP YOUR FINGER ON POSSIBLY ONE OF THE WEAK POINTS WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE'S BEEN REJECTED THEY STEP A HOT SPOT OR DO THEY MOVE TO ANOTHER TRANSIT CAMP I WOULD IMAGINE THE FORCE OF NUMBERS AT ONE POINT MAY MAKE GREECE HAVE TO TAKE THOSE HAVE BEEN REJECTED ITS REFUGEES TO OTHER PLACES BUT HOW ARE PEOPLE IN THE AREAS FEELING ABOUT THEM COS YOU MAY NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY
THEY DON'T MUCH LIKE IT THE REASON THEY'RE ONLY FOUR OF THE FIVE MARGARET CENTRES HAVE BEEN OPENED IS THERE IN THE FIFTH SCENT ON THE ISLANDS OF COS THERE'S BEEN STRONG LOCAL PROTEST AND REJECTION OF IT BUT THEY AGREE SAYS THAT IT WILL OPEN THE NEXT FEW DAYS
JAMES REYNOLDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX AN INSPECTION OF A PRISON IN LEICESTER HAS REVEALED HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE INCLUDING SELF HARM AND STAFF BEING REGULARLY ASSAULTED A REPORTER NICK BEAK HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE REPORT IN THIS IS BASED ON AN UNANNOUNCED INSPECTION AND SEPTEMBER NICK WANTED IT FIND
THAT'S RUBBISH I EVER THERE WERE A SERIES OF WORRYING FINDINGS AMONG THEM INSPECTOR SAID THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE PRISONERS AND THAT WAS BECAUSE NEITHER THE STAFF NO PRISONERS THEMSELVES KNEW THEIR DAILY ROUTINE IN THE INSPECTOR'S WORDS THEY SAID THAT THE CONSEQUENCE WAS CHAOS INSPECTORS WANT TO CARRY OUT SPOT CHECKS BUT THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE MEMBERS OF STAFF DOESN'T KNOW WHERE PRISONERS WERE THEY ALSO IDENTIFIED VERY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AT THE PRISON PARTICULARLY AGAINST THE STAFF
BUT ONE IS OF HIS REAL CONCERN IS THAT THE VIOLENCE WAS SAID TO BE THREE TIMES THAT OF OTHER SIMILAR CATEGORY B. PRISON SO A CITY CENTRE PRISONS SELF HARM WAS SAID TO BE FIVE TIMES THAT OF OTHER SIMILAR PRISONS AND IT ALL MADE FOR WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS A CHAOTIC PICTURE REALLY JUST BASICS NOT BEEN DONE WELL THE PRISONERS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO CLEAN CLOTHES UNABLE TO GET TO TOILETS AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SEGREGATION WING IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE KNOW THEY'VE HAD PROBLEMS BECAUSE BACK IN DECEMBER
THIS WAS A UNIT WEST SIX INMATES SMASHED THROUGH THEIR CELL WALLS AND THERE WAS A FOUR HOUR STAND OFF WITH GUARDS A WRECK AT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THIS REPORT IS THAT IT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE CLOSED IMMEDIATELY THAT UNIT'S GIVEN THAT IT IS A FEW MONTHS CENSUS INSPECTION HAPPEN DO WE KNOW WHAT THIS PRISON IS LIKE NOW
WE DON'T WE WE DO HAVE A STATEMENT FROM THE POWERS THAT BE THE NATIONAL OFFENDERS MANAGEMENT SERVICE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A DISAPPOINTING REPORT IN THEIR WORDS THEY SAY A NEW GOVERNESS BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE BIG PROBLEMS HERE AND THAT HE WILL MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME WAYS IT'S A SIMILAR PRISON TOOK TO OTHERS IT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS OLD AND OF COURSE DAVID CAMERON LAST WEEK WAS TALKING ABOUT AND THE BIGGEST OVERHAUL OF PRISON SINCE THE VICTORIAN ERA BUT YOU'VE GOT A PLACE HERE WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS
SHABBY WITH ONGOING PROBLEMS IT'S OVERCROWDED BY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND I THINK WHAT IS CONCERNING COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS INSPECTION TWO YEARS EARLIER THEY SAY THE PICTURED ACTUALLY DETERIORATED THAT POINT ABOUT OVERCROWDING IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF PRISONS ARE IN THAT POSITION THEN THEN THAT MUST QUESTION THE WHAT THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE WITHIN THE PRISON IF THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE SORTS OF NUMBERS THEY WEREN'T BUILT FOR
ABSOLUTELY JUST TALK TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR STUFF THEY SAY THE LOCALISED ISSUE WITH LEICESTER IS THAT LIKE OTHER CITY CENTRE PRISONS THERE'S A HIGH CHURN OF OF OF INMATES PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE COURTS THERE'S A HIGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON REMAND SAY THAT MAKES THINGS DIFFERENT I MENTIONED THAT IT'S AN OLD PRISON HUNDRED FORTY YEARS OLD BUT OF COURSE LIKE OTHER PLACES IT IS PLAGUED BY A VERY MODERN PHENOMENON THAT OF DRUGS PARTICULARLY SYNTHETIC DRUGS SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS
THIS REPORT FOUND THAT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF THE PRISON POPULATION SUFFERED FROM A DRUGS PROBLEM IN SOMEWAY ALTHOUGH IT DID KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO DID HAVE A PROBLEM WORK WOULD DEALT WITH QUITE EFFECTIVELY BY STAFF AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRAISED IN PART FOR THE WAY THEY DEALT WITH PEOPLE PRISONERS WERE SAID TO RESPECT STAFF OF THE JOB THEY DID BUT IT'S CLEAR READING THIS REPORT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A STRATEGY MANAGEMENT IS SEVERELY CRITICISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO DO THE BASICS AND ALSO IMPROVE THE PLACE
NICK BAKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT ON IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX FOUR OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OIL EXPORTERS HAVE AGREED TO FREEZE PRODUCTION TO TRY TO PUSH UP
PRICES HAS IT WORKED FULL TIME YOU BECKETT'S HERE TO TELL US WELL AT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS NO WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE OIL CARTEL OPEC ARE NOW TRAVELLING TO IRAN TO PERSUADE THE COUNTRY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEAL TO FREEZE OUTPUT SAUDI ARABIA RUSSIA QATAR AND VENEZUELA HAVE AGREED TO KEEP OUTPUT STEADY IN A BID TO STABILISE THE OIL PRICE WHICH OF COURSE IS FALLEN SEVENTY PERCENT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS HERE'S THE SAUDI OIL MINISTER ALLY I KNOW ME
IT IS A BEGINNING OF A PROCESS WHICH WE WERE THERE
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE NEED STEPS TO STABILISE AND HIM FOR ALL THE MARKET WE DON'T WANT
WE'RE GOING TO THICKEN GYRATIONS IN PRICES WE WANT JOHN THESE THE MAN AND THE WAY YOU WANT A STABLE OIL
TO ANSWER SARAH'S QUESTION AFTER A BRIEF SURGE THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF BRENT CRUDE FELL ACTUALLY MORE THAN THREE PER CENT YESTERDAY JUST OVER THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL IT HAS SINCE RE BOUNDED SLIGHTLY PULL STEVENS IS FROM THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CHATHAM HOUSE AND AN EXPERT ON ALL THE MARKETS AND THE MIDDLE EAST GOOD MORNING TO YOU HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT IRAN IS ON BOARD AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY JUST RETURNING TO THE MARKET
I THINK IN REALITY THIS AGREEMENT NO MATTER WHO IS ON BOARD HAS NO CREDIBILITY WHATSOEVER WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY THE MARKETS HAVE SORT OF DISCOUNTED IT IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE RECORD OF RUSSIA IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE RUSSIA AGREED WITH SAUDI ARABIA THAT THEY WOULD ASSIST IN PROMOTING HIGHER OIL PRICES AND THEN IMMEDIATELY RENEGE ON THAT AGREEMENT SO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY SO IN THE END NOT A GREAT DEAL WILL BE ACHIEVED
NO I THINK VERY LITTLE WILL BE AND I THINK IN A WAY THE SAUDIS REALISED THIS THEY CAN STICK TO THE AGREEMENT AND THEN IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME IF THE OIL PRICES BOUNCING OFF TWENTY DOLLARS A BARREL THEY CAN TURN ROUND AND SAID WELL WE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT BUT OTHER PEOPLE WOULDN'T HELP US SO WHY IS THERE A LACK OF WILL
I THINK EVERYBODY IS DESPERATE FOR THE REVENUE US AND THE FEELING IS WELL LET THEM TAKE THE PAIN AND WE CAN SIT BACK AND FREE RIDE
BUT OF COURSE THE IF THE ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS BY SAUDI ARABIA TO TRY TO PUT U.S. PRODUCERS OUT OF BUSINESS IT HASN'T REALLY WORKED HAS IT NO NOT SO FAR I MEAN PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE U.S. TITLE OIL PRODUCTION HAS PROVED TO BE FAR MORE RESILIENT THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT
IT THEY HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY EFFICIENCY REDUCING COSTS AND ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE TIGHT OIL PRODUCERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE LOSING MONEY HAND OVER FIST THEY STILL NEED EVERY DOLLAR THEY CAN GET BECAUSE THEY NEED THE MONEY TO PAY BACK THE BANKS THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS COMPLICATING MATTERS FOR A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE OF COURSE WITHIN OPEC BECAUSE SOME OPEC MEMBERS ARE SUPPORTING ONE SIDE OF THE CONFLICTS AND OTHERS SUPPORTING THE OTHER
YES THAT'S TRUE I MEAN THERE'S THE OBVIOUS CONFLICT IS BETWEEN IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN GOING FOR MARKET SHARE RAM HAS ALSO THREATENED THAT IT WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT'S BEEN OUT OF THE GAME FOR SOME TIME BECAUSE OF SANCTIONS
WE DESCRIBE THE FALLING ALL PRICE THIS DRAMATICALLY AS BEING A PROBLEM FOR MANY COUNTRIES OF COURSE IT'S NOT BUT IF SOME COUNTRIES GET INTO ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY THAT IN OF ITSELF COULD BE A PROBLEM SO IS THERE AN IDEAL PRICE FOR OIL IN THAT RESPECT THE IDEAL PRICES A PRICE THAT KEEPS EVERYBODY HAPPY WHICH MEANS OF COURSE WHERE MIGHT THAT BE WELL IT IT DOESN'T EXIST OF COURSE THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT THAT THE PRODUCERS WILL ALWAYS WANT HIGHER PRICES THE CONSUMERS WILL WANT LOWER PRICES
HOWEVER I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THESE LEVELS OF PRICES BECAUSE A NUMBER OF THE OIL PRODUCERS AND I'M THINKING OF VENEZUELA NIGERIA ANGOLA ALGERIA FACING SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHICH IS QUITE LIKELY TO SPILL OVER INTO POLITICAL UNREST IN THE RUSSIA OF COURSE WOULD BE ALSO FALLING INTO THAT CATEGORY YES O.K. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BASIC DYNAMICS OF COURSE PART OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE MARKETS PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE DESIRE TO PUT THE PUSH THE PRICE UP
IS THAT IN JANUARY THERE WAS IN FACT A GLUT OF OIL PRODUCTION SO SAYING THAT YOU WILL FREEZE PRODUCTION AT JANUARY LEVELS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO PUSH THE PRICE UP IS IT NO IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP AT ALL BECAUSE THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL OIL ABOVE GROUND
IN MANY CASES STORAGE IS PRETTY WELL FOR THE RESULT OF THIS IS THE THIS OVER SUPPLY IS HANGING OVER THE MARKETS ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IF THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND REDUCE THAT STOCK OVERHANG BECAUSE WHILE THAT STOCK OVERHANG IS THEIR PRICES ARE NOT GOING TO RISE VERY
PULL STEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY FACTORS OF COURSE CAUSING VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AT THE MOMENT ALEX DRYDEN IS GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT HE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO I WANT TO ASK YOU FIRST ABOUT A STORY THAT HAS EMERGED FROM THE UNITED STATES AND THAT IS THAT APPLE THE MAKER OF COURSE OF THE I PHONE
HE'S ISSUING BONDS NOW THIS IS THE EXTRAORDINARY THING TO BE DOING ISSUING TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BOMBS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW IT HAS A VAST AMOUNT OF CASH SITTING ON ITS BALANCE SHEET SO WHY DO YOU NEED DEBT IF YOU HAVE CASH
THE KEY IS ABOUT WHERE THAT CASH IS ACTUALLY LOCATED AND IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE LOCATION OF APPLE CASH A LOT OF IT SITTING OFFS OFFSHORE NOW FOR A LOT OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES IT SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST BRING THE CASH BACK HOME THE U.S. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE IS A TAXATION WHEN YOU REPATRIATE THAT CASH BACK INTO ON INTO U.S. SOIL OF AROUND THIRTY PER CENT NOW OBVIOUSLY U.S. COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO PAY THAT CASH SO WHILST INTEREST RATES ARE VERY LOW
HIGH QUALITY COMPANIES SUCH AS APPLE CAN BORROW AT VERY LOW INTEREST RATES THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RAISE MONEY AT HOME IN THE UNITED STATES AND NOT HAVE TO PAY THAT TAX ARE AN INTERESTING LITTLE QUIRK O.K. LET'S TURN NOW TO OTHER THOUGHTS OCCUPYING THE MARKET WE'VE MENTIONED OIL OF COURSE CHINA IS ANOTHER ONE WE'VE HAD NEWS THAT LOANS ARE EXPANDING AT QUITE A SIGNIFICANT RATE
HOW IMPORTANT AT THIS STAGE IS ARE THE DEBT CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO BECAUSE THEY KEEP COMING BACK IT APPEARS TO BE THE CURRENCY AND THE FOREIGN RESERVES THEIR INABILITY THEREFORE TO STABILISE THE CURRENCY AND ADD THE DEBT LEVELS
SO THE DEBT LEVELS ARE OUR CONCERN THEY ARE VERY LARGE NOW PEOPLE ARE SORT OF COMPARING THAT TO THE U.S. SUB PRIME MORTGAGE DEBT AND HOW OUT OF CONTROL THAT DEBT BURDEN WHO'D GOT DEBT BURDENS ARE OUT OF CONTROL ARE A QUITE DANGEROUS THE ISSUE HERE HOWEVER IS THAT WHEN THE U.S. SUB PRIME DEBT BREAKDOWN
A LOT OF THAT DEBT WAS SITTING ON BANKS ALL INTERNATIONAL BANKS' BALANCE SHEETS AND ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT FLOATED EXTERNALLY THE CHINESE HOWEVER IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION THE DEBT MOUNTAIN IS HELD INTERNALLY WITHIN CHINA LESS THAN TWO PER CENT OF CHINESE DEBT FLOATS AROUND NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS IT'S CHINESE DEBT BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN IT WOULDN'T IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE THE SAME SYSTEMATIC FRET AS THE U.S. SITUATION BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL BANKS ARE JUST NOT HOLDING CHINESE DAY
SO IF YOU WERE TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN CHINESE AUTHORITIES IN THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE SITUATION I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CENTRAL BANK PARTICULARLY WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY ABSENT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC COMMENT UNTIL RECENTLY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU BE CONFIDENT THAT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES COULD DO THE JOB I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT CHINA TRYING TO DO THEY'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THIS TRANSFORMATION INTO CONSUMPTION LED ECONOMY AND AWAY FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE LED ECONOMY NOW
THEY HAVE SIX SOME SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL FIREPOWER WHICH THEY CONFRONT THEIR SITUATION THEY HAVE THREE TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES WHICH THEY CAN USE TO BUY THE CURRENCY THEY CAN USE IT TO BUY DEBTS OR EQUITIES ALL OF THAT HELPS STABILISE THE SITUATION THEY'VE ALSO GOT INTEREST RATES THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO CUT THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE DEVELOPED WORLD WHERE THEIR INTEREST RATES VERY LOW THEY COULD CUT THAT GIVES THEM A LOT OF FINANCIAL FIREPOWER THEY CAN USE TO HELP STABILISE THE SITUATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
LET'S TURN NOW TO ANOTHER SHADOW LOOMING OVER THE MARKETS AND THAT IS THE POTENTIAL U.K. EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IS OF COURSE A PRETTY UNQUANTIFIABLE RISK AT THIS STAGE BUT THERE ARE ALREADY SIGNS THAT BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING AT IT VERY CAREFULLY IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS SO NOBEL THE DUTCH COMPANY BEHIND DO YOU LUX EMPLOYS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE U.K. IN IS INVESTING ONE HUNDRED MILLION
IN A NEW PAINT FACTORY IN ASHINGTON WHICH IS NEAR NEWCASTLE CONSTRUCTION WILL START LATER THIS YEAR I SPOKE TO THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE TONG BRUCKNER AND ASKED HIM WHETHER THAT INVESTMENT MEANS THAT HE'S NOT OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE BRAX IT
THAT PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IS DRIVEN BY THE TWO LOOKS BRAND THEIR BRANDS LIKE WEATHER SHIELD HAMMER RIGHT AND THESE ARE BRANDS THAT ARE BEING SUPPLIED TO THE U.K. ITSELF WE OF COURSE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN DO YOU
WE'VE INVESTED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH REQUIRED TO LARGE COMPANIES WE EMPLOY THIRTY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE WE HAVE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTRES SO THE U.K. FOR AUCTION ABOUT IS VERY VERY
THEREFORE WE'VE ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE WISH THAT IF WE HAD A CHOICE THAT WE WOULD PREFER THE U.K. TO STAY INSIDE AT THE E.U. BUT OF COURSE RESPECT EVERY DECISION THAT STEAK
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT AS TIME IS MOVING ON SOME COMPANIES ARE SEEING IT LESS AS A BIG WORRY MEANING THAT THEY FEEL MAY BE THAT THE U.K. COULD BROKER SOME INDIVIDUAL TRADE DEALS THAT IT WOULDN'T BE THE BIG DISASTER BUT IT WAS PERCEIVED SAY FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK IT'S ALL A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE
SO AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMPANY YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT INTERNATIONAL TRADE THE ROTATION AND EDUCATION OF PEOPLE THE EXCHANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT'S DONE IN THEN AS EASY AS POSSIBLE WAY WOULD IT AFFECT YOUR APPROACH TO DOING BUSINESS IN THE U.K. IF BRITAIN LEFT
AT THIS POINT IN TIME MOST OF OUR BUSINESSES ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE IN THE U.K. FOR THE U.K. SO THE SHORT TERM IMPACT IS EXPECTED TO BE QUITE LOW BUT IN THE LONG TERM WITH ALL THE EXCHANGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE IT MAY HAVE A NAME
WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO RUN BUSINESSES THEY TYPICALLY SAY THEY WOULD RATHER THAT BRITAIN STAYED WITHIN THE E.U. THEN IS YOU TALK TO THEM AS INDIVIDUALS THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE NUANCED VIEW YOU'RE A DUTCHMAN SO YOU CAN SEE FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE WHAT THIS NEGOTIATION LOOKS LIKE WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT HOW PRODUCTIVE IT IS EVEN TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
I BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE U.K. TO STAY IN THE E.U. BECAUSE I WOULD PERSONALLY MUCH PREFER THE U.K. TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU TO BECOME BETTER AS OPPOSED TO COMMON THING FROM THE SIDELINES WHAT WOULD MAKE THE EAD YOU BETTER WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT
AT THE MOMENT I GUESS THERE IS A GENERAL POPULATION DISSATISFACTION WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE RULES THAT COME OUT OF IT AND SOME OF THE INTERFERENCE THAT'S THERE AND OVERALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE E.U. IS A POSITIVE ASPECT I BELIEVE IT IS A VERY POSITIVE THING FOR EVERYBODY BUT THAT CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT YOU NEED TO DO YOU CAN HELP US
IS THE Y. YOU WERE TRADE ZONE OR DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MORE THAN THAT IT CAN BE MORE THAN THAT IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT MOTIVATES ITS POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY CREATES POSITIVE SPIRITS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE SEE AT THIS POINT IN TIME
THAT'S THE PROBLEM ISN'T IT THAT THE MIGRANT CRISIS THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THESE THINGS REALLY HAVE EXPOSED SOME VERY DIFFERENT THINKING WITHIN EUROPE
NOT ONLY HAVE THE EXPOSE DIFFERENT THINKING THEY'VE ALMOST BEEN MORE NOISY THAN THE ACTUAL POSITIVE ASPECTS THAT THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF FREE TRADE FREE TRAVEL
SINGLE CRAZIES AMONG MANY OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE ACTUAL CROSS LEARNING AMONG THE COUNTRY'S ALL THESE POSITIVE THINGS ALMOST ARE SNOWED UNDER IN THE NOISES THAT WE HAD
TOM BOOKING AT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ACCENT NOBEL TANYA THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX TIME FOR SOME SPORT AND ROB ON IT'S WITH US THIS MORNING WELL MORNING MYSEL SUNG IT WAS GOING WELL FOR CHELSEA AT PARIS SOUNDS AND MY LAST NIGHT IN THE FIRST LEG OF THEIR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TIE ONE ALL WITH TWELVE MINUTES TO GO IBRAHIM IMAGE FOR P.S.G.

INSPECTORS HAVE SEVERELY CRITICISED CONDITIONS AT LEICESTER PRISON THEY SAY THAT DURING THEIR VISIT IN OCTOBER THEY FIND UNACCEPTABLY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND THAT STAFF WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND SOME OF THE INMATES
CAMPAIGNERS HAVE WARNED THAT THERE'S EXCESS OF SUGAR IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOT FLAVOUR DRINK SERVED IN HIGH STREET CAFES THE GROUP ACTION ON SUGAR SAYS THAT AND SOME OF THE WORST CASES THE DRINKS HAVE TWENTY OR MORE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR
AN ASSOCIATION OF NURSERY SCHOOLS AND ENGLAND SAYS SERIOUS FUNDING SHORTFALLS COULD SEE FEWER THAN HALF OF ITS MEMBERS OFFERING THE EXTENDED FREE CHILDCARE FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS PLANNED BY THE GOVERNMENT

THE AMERICAN ROCK BAND EAGLES OF DEATH METAL HAVE PLAYED A CONCERT IN PARIS THREE MONTHS AFTER ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS MURDERED EIGHTY NINE OF THEIR FANS AT THE BATTER CLAR THEATRE SURVIVORS OF THE ATTACKS WERE IN THE AUDIENCE
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN DAVID CAMERON'S MAKING FINAL PREPARATIONS TO DAY AHEAD OF A EUROPEAN SUMMIT LIKE NO OTHER HE HAS KNOWN YOU'LL MEET THE TWENTY SEVEN OTHER LEADERS TOMORROW NIGHT CHRIS MORRIS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW FROM BRUSSELS OR TAKE US THROUGH THE POTENTIAL BIG STICKING POINTS THAT REMAIN KRIS
WELL MICHELLE WHERE D'YOU WANT ME TO START IT IT SEEMS THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE SUMMIT DAY BEGINS IT REMAINS CHILD BENEFIT LOOK AT WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS ASKED FOR IN THE PAST THE SPEECH BACK IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN A J.C.B. IN STAFFORDSHIRE YOU MAY REMEMBER AN ALARM GOING OFF IN THE BACKGROUND AS HE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT HIS RENEGOTIATION CLARENCE HE SAID THEN THAT IF YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR FAMILY
ARE AT HOME IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY WHILE YOU'RE WORKING HERE IN BRITAIN CHILD BENEFIT WILL NOT GO FROM BRITAIN TO THAT COUNTRY IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE BAN THAT'S ALREADY HAD TO BE WATERED DOWN TO CHILD BENEFIT BEING INDEX TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE CHILD LIVES IN POLAND FOR EXAMPLE
BUT NOW IT SEEMS THAT THIS GROUP OF EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE CLUBBING TOGETHER AND ARE INSISTING THAT PEOPLE CURRENTLY GETTING CHILD BENEFIT DO NOT HAVE IT CUT AND THESE NEW REDUCTIONS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO NEW APPLICANTS IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY REDUCTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM SO I THINK FOR MISTER CAMERON THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY PROBLEMATIC WE HEARD FROM
DONALD TOOK THAT SUMMIT CHAIRMAN YESTERDAY THOSE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ABSOLUTELY ADAMANT ON THIS POINT AND HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK AN EXTRA MILE THAT COULD BE I THINK A PRETTY LONG MILE BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE BIGGEST STICKING POINT AT THE MOMENT BUT OFFICIALS WILL BE TRYING TO USE THE TIME FROM NOW UNTIL DAVID CAMERON ACTUALLY GETS TO SEE THE OTHER LEADERS IN BRUSSELS TO TRY AND WORK OUT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN IN ADVANCE
THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN THERE IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAMMERING THROUGH THIS IN IN THAT SORT OF DETAIL AT THE TIME
I THINK SOME OF THOSE POINTS WILL HAVE TO BE HAMMERED THROUGH BY LEADERS YES YOU'RE RIGHT MEAN DIPLOMAT AND THE SHERPAS AS THEY'RE CALLED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN GETTING PRETTY LITTLE SLEEP FOR MONTHS NOW THEY'LL BE WORKING THROUGH THE DAY TODAY WE EXPECT SOME TIME TODAY
A NEW DRAFT OF THE TEXT TO BE FINALISED WHETHER WE'LL SEE THAT DURING THE DAY WE WE WE HOPE TO GET HOLD OF ONE TOMORROW DURING THE SUMMIT WE UNDERSTAND THE BRITISH YOU WILL BE DISCUSSED FIRST WHEN LEADERS MEET IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THEN THEY'LL MOVE ON TO
LET'S NOT FORGET FOR MANY COUNTRIES IT IS THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE STILL HAVE THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS BEFORE COMING BACK TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE BRITISH PROBLEM EITHER VERY LATE AT NIGHT OR FIRST THING ON FRIDAY MORNING I SUSPECT THEY WILL GO VERY VERY LATE INTO FRIDAY MORNING AND THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WE MENTIONED CHILD BENEFIT
THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE ON ON THE LANGUAGE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES THAT USE THE EURO SAINT AND THOSE THAT DON'T THERE ARE COUNTRIES WHO ARE STILL UNHAPPY ABOUT BRITAIN'S INSISTENCE THAT IT SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE IDEA OF EVER CLOSER UNION ALL AROUND THERE ARE STILL COUNTRIES TRYING TO PICK LITTLE BITS OF THE STITCHING AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO BE SO COMPLEX TO PUT THE DEAL TOGETHER AND MAURICE THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN TOLD HE CAN DELIVER AID TO SEVEN BESIEGED TOWNS IN SYRIA FOR HER SURROUNDED BY GOVERNMENT FORCES TO BY REBELS AND WON BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IN THAT ONE CAN ONLY BE REACHED WITH AN AIRDROP LENA SIN JAB IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BEIRUT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AREAS THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED OF HELP FROM OUTSIDE
YES INDEED AT THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN BESIEGED FOR MONTHS NOW IN THE AREA OF MUD IN SOUTH OF THE MASK AS A KEY SIXTEEN PEOPLE DIED SINCE THE LAST A DELIVERY LAST MONTH WE EXPECTING TODAY THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH AT LEAST FIVE TOWNS THREE IN IN THE MASK OR AROUND THE MASK
TWO IN THE NORTH AND THE DATA SAW AREA THIS IS BESIEGED BY THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WILL HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE END OF THE WEEK FOR AIR DROP TO BE ARRANGED BY THE U.N. YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING I KNOW TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THESE BESIEGED AREAS AND WHO HAVE AT SOME STAGE IN THE PAST GOT IT
YES INDEED I SPOKE TO A WOMAN IN MY DIRE HER VOICE WAS VERY FRAGILE SHE WAS EXPLAINING THE SITUATION ABOUT THE VERY LITTLE OLD FORWARD ARRIVED SHE ALSO SAID THAT SOME OF THE FORWARD THAT WAS DELIVERED WAS STOLEN BY BOTH THE CHECKPOINT THE GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNMENT AFFILIATE CHOCCY CHECKPOINTS AND THE REBELS INSIDE MY BUYER SO THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WHEN ADA'S DELIVERED IT'S NOT THREE.D.
REACHING PEOPLE IN NEED SHE ALSO SPOKE ABOUT A MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN HER NEEDING MEDICAL ASSISTANT BUT ALMOST EVERYONE YOU TALK TO HIM HIS BESIEGED AREA THEY SAY FORD IS NOT ENOUGH THEY WANT A BESIEGED TO BE LIFTED THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO NORMALITY WE WILL BE HEARING YOUR REPORT AND SPEAKING TO SENIOR FIGURE AT THE UN A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THANKS
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN A NEW SCHEME TARGETING HIGH RISK PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS TO BEGIN IN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES IN APRIL GIVING ONE TO ONE SUPPORT TO THOSE CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF CAUSING SERIOUS HARM OR EVEN MURDER DANNY SURE AS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY IS THIS GOING TO TARGET THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NOT NECESSARILY WILL TARGET PEOPLE THOUGHT TO BE AT HIGH RISK OF CAUSING SERIOUS HARM AND THEY MAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED THEY MAY NOT BUT THEY WILL BE IDENTIFIED
BY WHAT'S CALLED MULTI AGENCY GROUPS WHO PERHAPS INFORMED BY THE VICTIM THAT THEIR PARTNER IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDER AND THEN THEY WILL BE OFFERED SUPPORT UNDER THE SCHEME AND THE SORT OF SUPPORT THEY'LL BE OFFERED IS NOT ONLY
BESPOKE ONE TO ONE SESSIONS WITH A TRAIN CASE WORKER BUT ALSO HELP TO ADDRESS ANY ALCOHOL DRUGS OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THEY MAY HAVE AS WELL AS BEING GIVEN ADVICE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND PARENTING FOR EXAMPLE
THAT IS THE CARROTS IF YOU LIKE THE STICK IS IF THEY DON'T COMPLY IF THEY DON'T CO OPERATE WITH THE SCHEME THEN THEY WILL BE REFERRED TO POLICE AND THE POLICE WILL BE ON THEIR CASE THAT THE POLICE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL BE MADE AWARE THAT THEY POTENTIALLY CAUSE A RISK
AND THEY WILL TRY AND DO ANYTHING TO DISRUPT THEIR OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR AND BECAUSE THE CRITICISM WOULD BE IN THOSE CASES WHERE SOMEONE HAS ALREADY COMMITTED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU COULD SAY THE FOCUS OUGHT TO BE ON ON THE PROSECUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE RATHER THAN OFFERING THIS OTHER AVENUE
I THINK THE DIFFICULTY IS HE'S GETTING A PROSECUTION IN SOME CASES BECAUSE PERHAPS THE THE VICTIM DOESN'T WANT TO COME FORWARD DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE EVIDENCE PERHAPS IT'S HARD TO TO FIND THE EVIDENCE THE PROSECUTION IS ONE AVENUE BUT THIS IS ANOTHER ROUTE AND ALSO I THINK THE IDEA IS NOT JUST TO TACKLE THE OFFENDING NOW BUT ALSO TO TRY AND STOP IT IN THE FUTURE TO STOP
FUTURE VICTIMS IF PERHAPS THE PERSON HAS MOVED ON FROM THEIR PARTNER THEY'VE BEEN ABUSING TO STOP THEIR NEW PARTNER FROM FROM BEING ABUSED IT IS I'M TOLD AN INNOVATIVE NEW APPROACH IT'S CERTAINLY VERY AMBITIOUS
IT'S GOING TO BE PILOTED FOR THREE YEARS THREE AREAS ESSEX SUSSEX A SOUTH WALES ON NINE HUNDRED OFFENDERS OVER THOSE THREE YEARS AND CLEARLY IF IT'S A SUCCESS IT COULD BE ROLLED OUT BUT IT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST TRYING TO ADDRESS A BIG PROBLEM IF YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE STATISTICS ON NOT JUST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY THEIR CURRENT OR THEIR FORMER PARTNERS YES I THINK THE FIGURES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACTUALLY CAME OUT LAST WEEK HE FIGURES FROM THE CRIME SURVEY OF ENGLAND AND WALES
ONE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE LAST YEAR MEN AND WOMEN SAID THEY'D BEEN THE VICTIMS OF SOME KIND OF DOMESTIC ABUSE IT'S ALSO ESTIMATED THAT I THINK EVERY WEEK AROUND TWO WOMEN ARE KILLED BY THEIR EX PARTNER OR PARTNER SHOCKING FIGURES DANNY SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE TIMES TALKS OF A VERY STRESSED DAVID CAMERON PLEADING WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS YESTERDAY TO SAVE HIS RENEGOTIATION AND WARNING THEM THAT BRITAIN WAS IN DANGER OF VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U.

SIGNED MEMENTOS FROM THE LIKES OF GARY GLITTER ROLF HARRIS AND STUART HALL SUPERSTRONG LASER PENS AND DOZENS OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS INCLUDING EXTENDABLE BATTENS OR KNUCKLE DUSTERS IT RENAMED THE SITE SICK BAY AN EBAY REPRESENTATIVE TELLS THE PAPER THE SITE WORKS WITH REGULATORS TO ENSURE THAT LISTINGS COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND THE PROHIBITIVE MATERIALS REMOVED AS SOON AS THEY'RE IDENTIFIED THE DAILY MAIL'S MAIN STORIES AN ATTEMPT BY THE RINGLEADER OF A NATION GROOMING GANG THAT PREYED ON GIRLS IN ROCHDALE TO USE HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS TO AVOID BEING DEPORTED
AN IMMIGRATION TRIBUNAL HAS BEEN TOLD THAT SHOULD BE A AHMED WHO'S SIXTY THREE CLAIMS HE'S THE VICTIM OF A CONSPIRACY TO SCAPEGOAT MUSLIMS THE PAPER'S HEADLINE CALLS IT A PERVERSION OF JUSTICE THE DAILY MIRROR HIGHLIGHTS THE CASE OF A MISSING JUNIOR DOCTOR WHO'S REPORTED TO HAVE LEFT A LENGTHY NOTE FOR HER FAMILY IN WHICH SHE BRIEFLY MENTIONS THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT

AND FINALLY BACK TO BRECK'S IT EMMA THOMPSON APPEARS ON A COUPLE OF FRONT PAGES AFTER SIGNALLING HER SUPPORT FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. BY DESCRIBING BRITAIN AS A CAKE FILLED MISERY LADEN GREY OLD ISLAND THIS MONTH'S SON DISMISSES THE ACTRESS AS A PRO E.U. LOVEY AND TELLS HER IN HUGE TYPE SHUT YOUR CAKEHOLE THERE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ON MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING BRITISH OFFICIALS MAKING A FINAL PUSH TO FRAME A DRAFT DEAL ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE EVE OF A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
AT THIS POINT IN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL YEAR CANON OUTGOING PRESIDENT STILL GET HIS CHOICE FOR A NEW JUDGE ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT IS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ONCE AFTER THE DEATH OF JUSTICE ANTHONY AND SCAR LEAH HE'S TOLD REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DELAY CONFIRMATION HEARINGS THE CONSTITUTION
IS PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THAT WHEN THERE IS A VACANCY ON THE SUPREME COURT THE PRESENT THE UNITED STATES IS TO NOMINATE
IS TO CONSIDER THAT
EITHER THEY DISAPPROVE OF THAT NOMINEE OR THAT NOW MANY IS ELEVATED TO THE SPRING
HISTORICALLY THIS HAS NOT BEEN VIEWED AS A QUESTION
THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME FOR THE SENATE TO CONSIDER IN A FOUR WAY THE RECORD HOW MANY THAT I PUT
AND TO MAKE A DECISION WHEN I ASKED ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOFA WHAT THE REACTION'S BEEN LIKE
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE FIRST OF ALL THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL HAS SAID THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO BARACK OBAMA WANTS TO PROPOSE HE'S NOT GOING TO ENTERTAIN ANY HEARINGS FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON WHO SHOULD BE
ON THE SUPREME COURT WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY REWRITING OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE AS FAR AS ONE NO I THINK THE PRESIDENT SAYS FOR FOUR YEARS NOT FOR THREE YEARS BUT MITCH MCCONNELL SEEMS TO BE TAKING THE VIEW AND HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP THAT HE THEN SHOULD BE NO HEARING AT ALL FOR A NEW SUPREME COURT JUDGE
WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STILL IN OFFICE I SHOULD WAIT FOR A NEW PRESIDENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE MICHELLE I KNOW THIS WILL SHOCK YOU IF I SAY IT BUT I THINK POLITICS MIGHT HAVE COME INTO THIS BUT WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR THIS DECISION IS THERE A POINT BY WHICH THERE HAS TO BE A NEW JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE IN PLACE
NO THERE ISN'T BUT WHAT YOU HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS A DEADLOCK SUPREME COURT WHERE YOU HAVE EIGHT MEMBERS FOR BROADLY SPEAKING LIBERAL FOR BROADLY SPEAKING CONSERVATIVE AND IF THEY ARE DEAD LOCKED THEN THE DECISIONS OF LOWER COURTS
WILL PERTAIN SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A CHALLENGE GOING ON FROM TEXAS AT THE MOMENT ABOUT TIGHTENING ABORTION LAW THE TEXAN COURTS HAVE SAID THAT'S FINE IT WAS BEING CHALLENGED IN THE SUPREME COURT THAT LAW WILL NOW STAND IT COULD INADVERTENTLY WOULD LEAD TO MASSIVE TIGHTENING OF APPORTIONED OR BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY OF IT BEING CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE COURT IS DEADLOCK SO YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE TO GET THIS SORTED OUT
BUT THE APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT IS FOR LIFE AND IF YOU SUDDENLY HAVE
A LIBERAL MAJORITY ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTY YEARS WELL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO FIGHT AGAINST WITH EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT ALL IT ADDS ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THE THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND ON THE THEATRICS OF THAT HAD A TWEET THAT GENERATED A LOT OF REACTION A TWEET FROM JEB BUSH
YEAH JEB BUSH TWEETED
A PICTURE OF A HANDGUN WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED WITH WITH HIS NAME CARVED INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDGUN GOVERNOR JEB BUSH I'D HE TWEETED A PICTURE OF IT ACCOMPANIED BY ONE WORD ON THE ONE WORD WAS AMERICA
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THERE'S THE MEETING THAT HE THINKS OF AMERICA AS BEING GUNS WAS IT A MISTAKE DID HE HIT TWEET TOO SOON AND WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE MESSAGE THAT HE WANTED TO SEND EITHER WENT ANSWERED THE JEB BUSH WEBSITE BECAUSE I WANTED TO CHECK WHETHER THERE'D BEEN ANY KIND OF CLARIFICATION FROM HIM
THE OWNERSHIP OF THE JEB BUSH WEBSITE THE DOMAINE HAS LAPSED AND WAS BOUGHT BY DONALD TRUMP YOU GO TO THE JEB BUSH WEBSITE YOU ARRIVE BUT DONALD TRUMP DOC
JOHN SO FAR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR IT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THE BAND THE EAGLES OF DEATH METAL PLAYED THEIR FIRST CONCERT CONCERT IN PARIS LAST NIGHT SINCE JIHAD IS ATTACKED DURING THEIR PERFORMANCE AT THE BATTER CLAN THEATRE THREE MONTHS AGO THAT WAS THE NIGHT EIGHTY NINE OF THEIR FANS WERE KILLED A CORRESPONDENT COLIN PATERSON FOLLOWED THREE BRITS WHO WERE AT THE ORIGINAL GEGEN RETURNED TO PARIS TO SEE THE BAND PLAY AGAIN

COLIN PATERSON REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN IF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM IS CALLED AT THE END OF THE WEEK YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS OF THE Y. YOU OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IT WAS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY WHERE DAVID CAMERON WAS FOCUSING ON ANY PEAS OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICES ARE FORMER EUROPE CORRESPONDENTS ARE ABLE TO GUIDE US THROUGH WHO DOES WHAT AND WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW AND MATTHEW THE POINT ABOUT THE ANY PEAS WAS THAT WAS THE WORRY THAT AT A LATER DATE AFTER A REFERENDUM HERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHANGE WHAT'S AGREED
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE I MEAN I THINK THE WORD VITO IS PROBABLY TOO STRONG A WORD IT'S A WORD THAT'S BECOME POLITICISED BUT CERTAINLY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS PUSHED OVER THE YEARS SINCE ITS FOUNDATION TO BECOME STRONGER TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND SO M.E. PEAS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT IF
BRITISH PEOPLE VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. AND DAVID CAMERON'S PLAN THEREFORE NEEDS TO BECOME EUROPEAN UNION LAW ANY PEAS ARE GOING TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS UNDER WHICH IT BECOMES IF IT DOES EUROPEAN LAW O.K. LET'S START THEN AT THAT AT THE TOP OF THE OF THE TREE IF YOU LIKE OF THESE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS DAVID CAMERON WHEN HE SITS DOWN FOR THIS MEETING IN BRUSSELS TOMORROW NIGHT HE'S MEETING THE NATIONAL LEADERS THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL
YEAH SO WELL YOU SAY THE TOP OF THE TREE BUT ACTUALLY IN BRUSSELS THIS THERE'S A FIERCE DIVISION OVER WHICH IS THE STRONGER OF THE THREE MAIN INSTITUTIONS TO EUROPEAN COMMISSION THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS ALREADY MENTIONED BUT BUT
LET'S START THEN WITH THOSE TWENTY EIGHT MEMBER STATES THE COUNCIL ITSELF I THINK REALLY YOU'VE SEEN THIS IN HIS FOCUS WITH THE EUROPEAN LEADERS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY ARE INDEED THE PEOPLE THAT HE NEEDS TO SECURE THE BACKING OFF FOR THIS PLAN SO THEY ARE BROADLY SPEAKING GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE IF THEY CHOOSE TO THAT HELP HIM GET THROUGH THIS PLAN BUT THEY HAVE
CO DECISION IT'S CALLED ESSENTIALLY ON PAPER AT LEAST AN EQUAL PART OF THE DECISION BREAKING PROCESS ALONG WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT I MENTIONED THE COMMISSION LET'S GO BACK TO THEM LET'S LET'S LET'S LET'S ASSUME THAT
DAVID CAMERON'S PLAN IS PUT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION TO BECOME LAW IN THE EVENT THAT BRITAIN VOTES TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FIRST PART OF THE JIGSAW PUZZLE THEN WILL BE THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WILL PROPOSE DAVID CAMERON'S PLAN OR
ITS WORDING OF IT LEGALLY STICKLEY AS A NEW SERIES OF LAWS THAT HAVE TO BE PASSED BECAUSE THERE WILL NEED TO BE CHANGES NOT TO THE TREATIES BUT TO SECONDARY LEGISLATION THEY WILL THEN PASS
THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WHO WILL LOOK AT THEM AND DECIDE WHETHER THEY LIKE THEM OR NOT LET'S ASSUME THEY TOOK THEM OFF THEY'LL SEND THEM DOWN THE ROAD IT'S ABOUT HALF A MILE OR SO TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT'S COMMITTEE ON THIS WILL START TO LOOK AT THEM AND SEE IF THEY LIKE THEM AS WELL THEY WILL THEN PASS ANY AMENDMENTS ON TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT'S PLENARY SESSION AND IT COULD GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE TWO BODIES NOT AT ALL EASY TO EXPLAIN BUT THANKS FOR HAVING A GO PRICE THANK YOU
DID A MARVELLOUS JOB SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THE N.H.S. HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY BAD INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGY HAVE LONG BEEN TOLD IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO LINK UP THE ENTIRE HEALTH SERVICE AT THE PRESS OF A BUTTON BUT THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATE FOR THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WAS THAT FAILED I.T. SCHEMES HAD COST THE N.H.S.
TEN BILLION POUNDS AND THAT'S WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT THE THINK TANK THE NOTHING NUFFIELD TRUST HAS PUBLISHED A REPORT THEY SAY THAT RATHER THAN SOME BIG OVERARCHING SCHEME DOCTOR SHOULD USE MORE TECHNOLOGY IN THERE EVERY DAY DEALINGS WITH PATIENTS NIGEL EDWARDS IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NUFFIELD TRUST
LIKE TODAY'S REPORT HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ANY AND YOU FOUND THAT RATHER REMARKABLY SEEMED HEALTHCARE IS AT LEAST A DECADE BEHIND OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE WAY THAT HE USES I.T. THAT BEEN OPTIMISTIC ASSESSMENT THIS IS FINDING AN AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL I THINK HE'S EXTREMELY COMPLEX BUT AND BUT PEOPLE EXPECT TO FIND THAT SAME LEVEL OF DIGITAL TOOLS AND THE THINGS THAT BOOKING SYSTEMS THEY HAVE IN THEIR EVERY DAY LIFE AND THEY GET TO THE DOORS OF THE HOSPITAL AND IT ALL STOPS AND THAT'S TRUE FOR A LOT OF DOCTORS
THE SYSTEM SO SEEM TO HAVE WORKED AND THEY MUCH MUCH SMALLER MORE MANAGEABLE I THINK MAYBE WHERE WE'VE GONE WRONG AS A SORT OF IN A FIT OF TECHNO OPTIMISM THOUGHT THAT YOU'D HAVE ONE BIG SYSTEM BUT WE'VE LEARNT IS THAT YOU NEED TO GET THE REDESIGN THE SYSTEMS GET THE CONDITIONS REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WORKS IT BECAUSE IF YOU COMPUTERISE OR BY A BAD SYSTEM YOU GET A BAD SYSTEM THAT WORKS MUCH FASTER RIGHT SO IT'S BASICALLY FROM THE BOTTOM UP YOU'RE SAYING LET'S DO IT FROM THE BOTTOM UP RATHER THAN THE TOP DOWN
WHAT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE IN A WAY THAT THE INTERNET HAS DEVELOPED AN APSE HAVE DEVELOPED YES MANY HOSTELS HAVE PERHAPS GONE AND A BIT FAR IN THAT DIRECTION EVEN A MEDIUM SIZE HOSPITAL MIGHT HAVE ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT I.T. SYSTEMS YOU'VE GOT TO GET THEM TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND IT'S NEAT THERE'S A GOOD ARGUMENT HARRY ONE SYSTEM IN THE HOSPITAL BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ONE FOR THE N.H.S. WHAT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THOUGH IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE SYSTEM TO STANDARDISE WORK TO IMPROVE CO ORDINATION TO HELP PATIENTS USE THE SYSTEM IN A IN A MORE USER FRIENDLY WAY
AND WITH THIS BUT NOT BEEN NEARLY ENOUGH FOCUS ON THE ORGANISATIONAL ON BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS OF THIS ONE'S GOT VERY OBSESSED WITH THE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SOFTWARE AND GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BUT THE MISSED THE POINT THAT IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW THE PEOPLE WORK AND HOW YOU GET INVOLVED IN IN THINKING ABOUT THIS IT WILL FAIL OH I WOULD JUST GIVE ONE EXAMPLE YOU TALK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE OF AN APP ON A SMARTPHONE WHICH WHERE YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR DOOR IF YOU'RE DIABETIC YOU CAN PUT IN THE ODD YOUR DETAILS IN THERE AND THE DOCTOR WILL KNOW
WHAT HOW THEY SHOULD TREAT YOU THERE'S FORTY SIX AS NAPS LIKE THAT ON THE EYE TUNE STORE WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES WORK AND WE DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW HOW YET TO GET THOSE SORT OF TALKING TO THE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY GOOD IF YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN ONE DISEASE BUT WITH JUST TIPPING POINT I THINK WHERE AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF OF OFTEN FAILED EXPERIMENT WE'VE NOW GOT ENOUGH EXPERIENCE ABOUT KNOWING HOW TO DO THIS THAT WE MAY BE AT THE POINT WHERE WE START TO SEE THIS HAVING A DIFFERENCE NIGEL EDWARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE MAKING A FINAL ATTEMPT TO SHAPE A DRAFT DEAL ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE EVE OF THE SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS AND A CAMPAIGN GROUP IS WARNING THAT FLAVOURED HOT DRINKS IN WELL KNOWN COFFEE SHOPS CAN CONTAIN THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY BUXTON B.B.C. NEWS HAS BEEN GIVEN DETAILS OF A NEW SCHEME UNDER WHICH MAN WHO POSE A HIGH RISK OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WILL BE OFFERED SUPPORT TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR THE PROGRAMME KNOWN AS DRIVE IS BACKED BY TWO DOMESTIC ABUSE CHARITIES SAVE LIVES AND RESPECT AND IS BEING PILOTED AN ESSEX SUSSEX AND SOUTH WALES ONE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO THEY'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE LAST YEAR WITH TWO WOMEN KILLED EVERY WEEK HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE

BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE OUT OF THE FINAL PHASE OF NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD OF THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT TOMORROW WHICH COULD SEE DAVID CAMERON SEAL AN AGREEMENT ON CHANGES TO THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT WHETHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL SIGN UP TO THEIR PLAN TO TIGHTEN ACCESS TO WELFARE PAYMENTS WITH DINING STREET KEEN TO ENSURE DRAFT PROPOSALS AREN'T WATER OR DIE
IF Y. U. LEADERS APPROVE A DEAL THE REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP COULD BE HELD AS EARLY AS JUNE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
THE NEGOTIATIONS SURROUNDING THE DEAL HAVE REACHED A DIFFICULT STAGE HIS OFFICIALS HAGGLE OVER A REVISED DRAFT TO PRESENT TO THEIR PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS THE CURRENT TEXT INSIST THAT THIS WILL BE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT SO EVERY WORD MATTERS THERE ARE STILL DISPUTES ABOUT THE SCOPE AND THE EXACT NATURE OF RESTRICTIONS ON WELFARE BENEFITS FOR CITIZENS FROM OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE U.K.
IN ADDITION FRANCE IS JUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES AND JUST TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IN THE DEAL WOULD ALLOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE CITY OF LONDON TO BENEFIT FROM LIGHTER REGULATIONS THAN THEIR CONTINENTAL COUNTERPARTS
MOST DIPLOMAT SEEM CONFIDENT THAT A DEAL CAN BE DONE THIS WEEK NOT LEAST BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR POLITICAL MASTERS ON TO FOCUS ON OTHER ISSUES NOTABLY THE MIGRATION CRISIS THAT MEANS WE COULD NOW ON FRIDAY EVENING WHEN THE REFERENDUM WILL BE HELD TO DECIDE WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS IN THE E.U. OR LEAVES
GREECE SAYS IT'S FINISHED WORK ON FOR MIGRANT SCREENING FACILITIES THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED FOR ITS BORDER CONTROLS AND THE NEW CENTRES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR GREEK OFFICIALS TO HANDLE THE MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD THEIR TO REACH THE E.U.

DAVID CAMERON HAS PROMISED THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF PRISONS SINCE THE VICTORIAN ERA THE PICTURE PAINTED AT LESTER SUGGEST IT'S BADLY NEEDED INSPECTORS DESCRIBED THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR OLD PRISON AS CHAOTIC AND SHABBY AND CALLED THE SEGREGATION UNIT TERRIBLE AND SAID IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN
LEVELS OF VIOLENCE WERE THREE TIMES THAT FOUND IN OTHER CATEGORY B.

IT SAYS NURSERIES ARE ABLE TO MAKE UP THE LOSS ONLY BY CHARGING PARENTS ARE HIGHER RATE FOR THE TIME THEIR CHILDREN SPEND ABOVE FIFTEEN HOURS THE ASSOCIATION SAID FEWER THAN HALF OF NURSERIES THAT RESPONDED TO ITS SURVEY SAID THEY WERE LIKELY TO OFFER THE EXTRA TIME THE EDUCATION MINISTER SAM GINA SAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR WAS BEING SPENT IMPROVING THE RATE NURSERIES RECEIVED AND HE INSISTED IT WAS SUFFICIENT

HE MAY HAVE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS FACES IN THE WORLD BUT IT SEEMS EVEN SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY IS NOT RECOGNISED FROM TIME TO TIME FOOTAGE HAS EMERGED OF SIR PAUL BEING TURNED AWAY FROM HER GRAMMYS AFTER SHOW PARTY IN HOLLYWOOD HOSTED BY THE RAPPER TIGER IN THE VIDEO ON THE T. M. C. WEBSITE SO PAUL ACCOMPANIED BY THE ROCK STAR'S BECK AND TAYLOR HAWKINS IS HEARD ASKING I.V.I. P. TO BE GOING TO GET
WE'VE GOT TO GO NOW WHO WILL YOU
HOW DO YOU NORMALLY GO
SO PAUL MCCARTNEY THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE BIGGEST EUROPEAN SUMMIT OF DAVID CAMERON'S CAREER AND THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR BRITAIN FOR MANY YEARS BEGINS IN BRUSSELS TOMORROW NIGHT WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER WILL FACE A GATHERING OF TWENTY SEVEN OTHER LEADERS EACH NEEDING TO BE PERSUADED OF HIS CASE FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR THAT SUMMIT OF BEING MADE TODAY AND WE'RE JOINED BY OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BERG LAURA WHERE DO WE STAND NOW ON THE CHANCES OF THE DRAFT DEAL BEING APPROVED
MICHELLE I THINK THEY'RE VERY GOOD BUT IT'S NOT A SLAM DUNK COMING IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IT IS NOT GOING TO BE FOR THE WANT OF TRYING IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HE'S AT MEETING AFTER MEETING IN DIFFERENT EUROPEAN CAPITALS TO TRY TO SQUARE THE NEVER ENDING CIRCLES IN THIS DEAL AND IT'S ALMOST TIME THAT THE POLITICAL LEADERS LOOK INTO THE WHITES HAVE EACH OTHER'S EYES ACROSS THE DINNER TABLE IN BRUSSELS WHERE THE BLOCKAGES CAN IN THEORY MIRACULOUSLY COME UNSTUCK
THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO BE IRONED OUT ON BENEFITS IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO ON THE RULES ABOUT MAKING THINGS EQUAL BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROZONE AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN IT LIKE US BUT THE ONE THING THERE IS CONSENSUS ON IS THAT LEADERS WANT TO GET THIS DONE AND THEY WANT TO GET OFF THE AGENDA
AND IT'S NEARLY ALWAYS IN THE MANNER OF THESE THINGS THAT THERE'S A REAL SENSE OF SORT OF LAST MINUTE BRINKMANSHIP CAN THEY GET A DEAL OVER THE LINE THEN LO AND BEHOLD TWO A.M. IN THE SORT OF SWEATY SUMMIT A DEALER'S PRODUCED WITH A FINAL FLOURISH BUT I WOULD SAY THIS IT'S JUST WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE DEADLINE HERE IS A POLITICAL DESIRE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN GET IT DONE AND GIVE US ALL A VOTE AT THE END OF JUNE BUT IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL FIXED ONE THE PRIME MINISTER DOES HAVE A WRIGGLE ROOM
AND THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THIS ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT IT CAN BE PUT OFF BECAUSE THE REFERENDUM DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE UNTIL THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN BUT ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY WHO'LL BE IN DOWNING STREET ACTUALLY RATHER THAN ON THE CONTINENT HE DOESN'T JUST HAVE SQUARES TO CIRCLE WITH OTHER E.U. LEADERS HE STILL HAS WORK TO DO WITH HIS COLLEAGUES TOO WELL INDEED SO WHAT CAN HE PRODUCE TO REASSURE THOSE AT HOME OR TO CONVINCE AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE AT HOME OFTEN YOU SEE THERE'LL BE SOME WILL NEVER BE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING BUT HE PRINTED
WE EXPECT ALONGSIDE THE DEAL IN BRUSSELS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO PRESENT SOME SORT OF PLAN TO GIVE OUR SUPREME COURT MORE POWERS TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE EUROPEAN COURTS TO JUST BE ABLE TO OVERTURN BRITISH LAWS THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE BUGBEAR FOR HER MANY CONSERVATIVES THAT LAWS MADE IN WESTMINSTER CAN BE CHUCKED OUT AND FINDING A LEGAL WAY OF TWEAKING THAT HAS NOW BECOME A KEY TEST FOR SOME MINISTERS IN PARTICULAR YOU'VE BEEN FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA OF BACKING LEAVING THE E.U. THERE IT'S VERY TRICKY LEGALLY TO DO THIS AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED IT'S FIENDISHLY DIFFICULT IT WOULD IT WOULD NEVER REALLY WORK
BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN SUBSTANTIVE DETAILS OF THAT PUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BUT I UNDERSTAND THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY WILL BE WORKING THE PHONES IN SEEING COLLEAGUES AND BEGINNING TO SHARE THE DETAILS OF THAT PLAN
POLITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF COURSE BORIS JOHNSON IS ONE OF THOSE AMONG OTHERS HE'S LIKELY TO BE PRESENTED WITH THE DETAILS AND THIS WILL BE A PART OF HIM AND OTHERS EVENTUALLY MAKING UP THEIR MINDS AND OF COURSE WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHO'S GOING TO BE IN AND OUT BUT THERE ARE SOME BIG NAMES STILL UNDECIDED BUT COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO HOW THIS PLAYS OUT DORIC AND BAG THANK YOU
IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE ALL KNOW CANNED FIZZY DRINKS HAVE LOTS OF SUGAR WHAT IF YOU BUY A COFFEE WITH A FLAVOUR SHOT IN IT THE CAMPAIGN GROUP ACTION ON SUGAR FOUND ONE DRINK AT STARBUCKS WITH THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR
AND THE LARGE HOT CHOCOLATES CONTAIN FIFTEEN TEASPOONS AS DOUBLE THE MAXIMUM THAT AN ADULT SHOULD HAVE IN A DAY QUARTER HASHEM IS THE NUTRITIONIST TO COMPILE THE REPORT FOR ACTION ON SUGAR AND HE'S IN A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING THERE WE SHOULD BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SORT OF A NORMAL COFFEE ARE WE NO ABSOLUTELY NOT WE DID INCLUDE ANY STANDARD LATTES CAPPUCCINOS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WHAT DID YOU LOOK AT COS YOU LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT OF DRINKS
YES WE LOOKED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PRODUCTS OF WHICH ARE ALL FLAVOURED AND SOME SORT OF WAY SO THEY HAVE A HAVE ADDED SYRUP THEY HAVE ADDED CHOCOLATE POWDERS AND ALL THEY THEY JUST HAD SOME SORT OF FRUIT JUICE PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE THE HOT TO ME OLD FRUIT PRODUCTS OUT OF THEM SO IT'S THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE FLAVOURED THE ONES THAT WE KNOW THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF ADDED SUGAR TO THEM BUT YOU FOUND THERE WAS HUGE AMOUNTS OF SUGAR
ABSOLUTELY SO THERE ARE PRODUCTS LIKE YOU MENTIONED I HAVE TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OTHERS THAT ARE LIKE A CHILD I'LL TAKE THAT HAVE TWENTY TEASPOONS OF SUGAR YES THESE PRODUCTS ARE THE LARGER PORTION SIZES BUT EVEN THOSE THAT'S OUR REGULAR STANDARD PORTION SIZES STILL HAVE ABOUT FIFTY GRAMS OF SUGAR AND WE WERE SURPRISED WITH THAT EYE I HAD ASSUMED IT WOULD BE PROBABLY HALF THAT AMOUNT NOT EXPECTING GET TO SOME PRODUCTS TO CONTAIN NINETY NINETY NINE GRAMS OF SUGAR
NOW THE STARBUCKS HAS SAID WHICH IS GETTING IN THE NECK A BIT FROM YOUR REPORT THAT IT'S COMMITTED TO REDUCING ADDED SUGAR AND IT'S DRINKS BY A QUARTER BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT THEY PUT ALL THEIR NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION IT'S AVAILABLE IF SOMEBODY'S BUYING THESE DRAINS
IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND THOSE THAT INFORMATION IN STORE THEY ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE NOT AT ALL THEY'RE OUT OF HOME KATH'S CHAINS AND FAST FOOD CHAINS HAVE THAT INFORMATION EVEN ON THEIR WEBSITE SO NOT OUR CONSUMERS HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR BETTER LABELLING INSTALL PARTICULARLY FOR THE SUGAR CONTENT OF THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE GENERALLY PEOPLE WON'T ASSOCIATE THAT STAGGER AMOUNT OF SUGAR WITH THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS PRESUMABLY LES EQUITY BY HOT CHOCOLATE YOU KNOW YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING THAT'S SWEET
YES BUT NOT THAT MUCH SUGAR TO CONTAIN YOU KNOW THREE TIMES OR TWO TIMES YOU'RE RECOMMENDED INTAKE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY AND ALL THAT YOU DON'T IT'S THE COFFEE SHOPS THAT ARE THE WORST OR IS IT THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WE SEE ON THE HIGH STREETS
YES AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE LARGER PORTION SIZES WHICH IS WHY WERE ALSO CALLING FOR THOSE LARGER PORTION SIZES TO NOT BE AVAILABLE ANY MORE I DON'T SEE WHY THIS SHOULD BE A PINT OF COFFEE PARTLY THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CAFFEINE CONTENT IN THEM BUT ALSO QUITE A LOT OF SUGAR BECAUSE OF THE LARGE PORTION SIZES COURSE HASHEM THANK YOU
IT'S A QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S EXTENSION OF FREE CHILDCARE FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN ENGLAND IS DUE TO BEGIN IN THE AUTUMN ELIGIBLE PARENTS WOULD BE OFFERED THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IN TERM TIME BUT THE NATIONAL DAY NURSERIES ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT MANY OF ITS MEMBERS WILL STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE THE EXTRA HOURS BECAUSE THE SCHEME IS POORLY FUNDED THAN HIM AN IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ASSOCIATION IN SHE JOINS US FROM BLACKBURN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE OFFERING PER HOUR OF CHILD CARE AND WHAT YOU SAY IS NEEDED
I THINK AT THAT MOMENT ACTUALLY THE IF IT'S THAT DIFFERENT OUR REPORT WHAT IS SHOWING IS THAT THE LAST THAT THEIR SETTEES ARE MAKING I HAVE ONE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS PARALYSES ABOUT ONE POUND SIXTY EIGHT NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN THE SPENDING REVIEW THAT FUNDING DOESN'T COME UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN
AND THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN EXISTING FOR HER NUMBER AFIA'S IN TERMS OF THE CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING UP THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME AND THAT'S WHY THE NURSERIES ARE ACTUALLY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE EXTENDED HOURS SO IF YOU LIKE ME AND YOU ARE HAPPY WITH WHAT WILL BE IN PLACE AFTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT'S THE UNDERFUNDING UP TO THAT POINT THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT I THINK IT'S NOT WE ARE HAPPY BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION WORKS OUT ABOUT FOUR POUND EIGHTY EIGHT
AND AT THE MOMENT THE NURSERY'S ACTUALLY GET ON AVERAGE ABOUT THREE POUND EIGHTY FROM THEIR LOCAL AUTHORITY I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE AND UNDERSTAND IS THAT IF ALL THAT MONEY IS PASSED ON TO THE NURSERY PROVIDERS
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DELIVER THIS PADDED MIXTURE ARE PAID CHILDREN FULLY PAID CHILDREN THE SUMP AND THE CHILDREN BACK AT THE MOMENT THEY DO NOT GET ALL THAT MONEY BECAUSE EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY DECIDES ON HOW MUCH MONEY THEY PASS ON TO THE LOCAL MAYOR SLEAZE TO DELIVER THIS HALF AND THAT'S WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT WHAT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO DOING IN THE FUNDING THAT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
HE'S MAKING AVAILABLE WE DID OFF THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION TO TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME THEY DIDN'T BUT THEY DID SAY THAT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVING HAS BEEN GOING UP AND THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY'VE SET ASIDE HAS BEEN BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU I THINK THE THE FACT THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN GOING UP ON THEM BUT THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE PASSING AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT ACTUALLY WHAT THE SURVEYOR HAS HIGHLIGHTED
THAT ONLY TWENTY FOUR PERCENT HAD A VERY SLIGHT INCREASE BECAUSE LAST YEAR THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY THIS YEAR IS ABOUT EIGHTY THREE BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE NATIONAL LIVING BED HAS ACTUALLY PUT UP THE PAYROLL COST FOR GAME EH AT LEAST TEN PERCENT THIS YEAR AND THAT WILL KEEP ON INCREASING BY TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE LOOKING AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PERIL AND STUFFING COS FOR NURSERIES AND THERE'S NO WAY THIS SOMETHING IS GOING TO BE ADEQUATE WHAT WILL YOUR MEMBERS DO THEN
WELL I THINK WHAT THEY'RE HAVING TO DO IS ACTUALLY THINK VERY CAREFULLY HOW MANY HOURS THEY WERE ABLE TO OFFER AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PLACES THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER AND THAT'S WHY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE NURSERIES THAT WE'VE SURVEYED OUR SAYING THEY ARE LIKELY ARE LESS LIKELY TO ACTUALLY OFFER THESE PLACES IN THE FUTURE WHICH WOULD MEAN IT WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO AS MANY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AS THE GOVERNOR IF THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW AT THE PARENTS WILL WILL STRUGGLE IN TERMS OF FINDING ADEQUATE PLACES
A FLEXIBLE FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN FAMILY'S NEEDS AND HEMA TEN WHO COULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S NINETY MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CHANCERS CONSIDERING CHANGING TAX RELIEF ON PENSIONS BUT WOULD IT PUT PEOPLE OFF SAVING TANYA BECKETT
GOOD MORNING TO YOU WELL THE CONCERN IS THAT IT MIGHT THIS OF COURSE IS IN RESPONSE TO PLANS BEING CONSIDERED BY GEORGE OSBORNE IN NEXT MONTH'S BUDGET TO CHANGE THE TAX RELIEF ON PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS DOWN THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY PRICE HIGHER EARNERS OUT OF PENSION SAVINGS JOHN SPEARS IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT FIRM BUT EKI INVESTORS HE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT IS IN THE OFFING RIGHT NOW
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT OF TAX RELIEF TO BE LINKED TO THE AMOUNT OF TAX YOU PAY FOR IT TO BE A FLAT FOR EIGHT AND THAT'S THAT YOU WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE TAXED ON PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IF YOU WERE A HIGHER TAX RATE PAYER SIMPLE AS THAT
YOU'D GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX RELIEF AS SOMEONE WHO WAS PAYING A LOWER RATE OF WE KNOW WHAT HE WOULD'VE PAID INCOME TAX BUT YOU WOULDN'T GET IT ALL BACK AS YOU NOW DO EXACTLY SO WHAT IS THE THINKING BEHIND THIS I MEAN THE OBVIOUS THING AND I'M SURE THIS HASN'T CROSS THE CHANCELLOR'S MIND IS THAT IT WOULD PUT MONEY IN HIS POT IN HIS COFFERS RIGHT
YES THAT'S QUITE A CONVENIENT OUTCOME OF THIS AND I'M AFRAID I'M A LITTLE MORE CYNICAL THAN EUROPE
BUT IF YOU'RE DESIGNING A PENSION SCHEME FROM FROM THE SCRATCH NOW I THINK HE'D BE QUITE HARD TO SEE WHY YOU SHOULD GIVE AN EXTRA INCENTIVES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY QUITE A LOT BETTER OFF THAN THE AVERAGE
BUT WHEN YOU KEEP MAKING CHANGES TO THE SCHEME EVERY YEAR AND YOU'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO INVEST FOR DECADES ON IT IS THIS AND THEN YOU CHANGE THAT IT SEEMS A LITTLE UNFAIR AS IT REDUCES THEIR CONFIDENCE AND SO HE'S HE'S GOT A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT HERE HE'S ALSO OF COURSE BROUGHT DOWN A CAP ON THE AMOUNT BUT YOU CAN HAVE IN A PENSION FUND AND STILL CONTRIBUTE AND GET TAX RELIEF TO IT
YES IT'S BECOME INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND IT PENALISES STRONG INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IF HE DOES BRING IN THIS FLAT RATE SKEIN WHICH I THINK HE WILL THEN THEN AT THE VERY LEAST I'M HOPING HE'LL REMOVE THE LIFETIME LIMIT O.K. BUT WHAT DO YOU THE UNDERLYING PURPOSE HERE IS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO SAVE IS HE ACHIEVING THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE'S THE OTHER ASPECT WHICH IS THAT YOU'RE NOW ALLOWED TO TAKE OUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WHEN YOU'RE FIFTY FIVE TAX RATE
WELL THE BIG THING THAT'S HAPPENING IS HE'S BRINGIN OUGHTA ENROLMENT AND NOW WE'VE GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAVING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC AND THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING INTO THEIR SCHEME'S GOING TO INCREASE QUITE SHARPLY IN A FEW YEARS' TIME AND HE WILL HAVE TO OFFER PENSION RELIEF ON THAT OF COURSE HE WERE ON THAT'S GOING TO COST HIM QUITE A BIT OF EXTRA MONEY FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONWARDS SO WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THESE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE PUT THROUGH IN THE BUDGET
IF I WAS A BETTING MAN I THINK I HAVE QUITE A LOT OF MONEY ON ON THAT THIS CHANGE COMING THROUGH JOHN'S SPEARS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON'S REAFFIRMED BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO DEFEND THE FALKLANDS ON A VISIT TO THE ISLANDS THE FIRST BY BRITISH DEFENCE SECRETARY MORE THAN A DECADE HE CONFIRMED THAT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE WOULD SPEND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS ON IMPROVING THE DEFENCES OF THE FALKLANDS OVER THE NEXT DECADE
HE TALKED OF HOPES OF IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH ARGENTINA BUT CLAIMED THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE FUTURE OF THE ISLANDS CAME FROM THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BILL HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH THE DEFENCE SECRETARY AND SENT THIS REPORT
WITH THE SOUND OF THE WAVES AND THE WIND EIGHT THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME
MICHAEL FALLON LIKE MANY TOURISTS WHO VISIT THE FALKLANDS EVERY YEAR HAS COME TO LOOK AT THE WILDLIFE THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS AT THE PENGUIN NUMBERS YEAH YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT BUT THIS VISIT IS ABOUT MORE THAN
THE ROAR OF R.A.F. TYPHOON JETS PERMANENTLY STATIONED HERE IS A REMINDER OF THE FALKLANDS DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ARGENT
LADDER CLEAR AS WELL AS THESE MEMBERS OF THE SEVENTY FIVE STRONG FALKLAND'S DEFENCE FORCE THEIR HOME GUARD THERE ARE STILL TWELVE HUNDRED BRITISH MILITARY PERSONNEL STATIONED ON THE ISLANDS
AND BACK IN THE U.K. THERE ARE FEARS MISTER FALLON'S VISIT THE FIRST BY A DEFENCE SECRETARY IN FOURTEEN YEARS COULD INFLAME TENSIONS WITH ARGENTINA
BUT HE SEEMS MORE INTERESTED IN PICKING A FIGHT WITH A LABOUR LEADER IS CALLED FOR A DIALOGUE WITH ARGENTINA ABOUT THE ISLAND'S FUTURE
THE BIGGEST THREAT AT THE MOMENT ISN'T ARGENTINA ACTUALLY IT IS JEREMY CORBOULD ON THE LABOUR PARTY WHO SEEM DETERMINED TO OVERRIDE THE WISHES OF THE ISLANDERS THAT'S THE IMMEDIATE THREAT
WHY WHAT IS IT AN IMMEDIATE THREAT THAT'S BECAUSE LABOUR THE PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION WILL BE PRESUMABLY FIGHTING THE NEXT ELECTION ON THAT BASIS HE HASN'T SAID WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE FOOTMAN'S UP JEREMY CALLED IT NOBODY'S SAID THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE ISLANDERS CAN'T BE HOLED UP AT A KIND OF DIALOGUE
MICHAEL FALLON'S COME HERE TO LAY A WREATH AT THE MEMORIAL TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE BRITISH SERVICEMEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES LIBERATING THE FALKLANDS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU EACH HAVE THEIR NAMES WRITTEN ON WHETHER
THIS MEMORIALS NEAR A STREET CALLED THATCHER DRIVE AND A STATUE JUST OVER THERE TO THE FORMER TORY LEADER THE POLITICS OF THE FALKLANDS IS HARD TO IGNORE BUT MICHAEL SUMMERS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FALKLANDS LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY SAYS JEREMY CORBIN'S NOT THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN
IT'S UNDOUBTEDLY ARGENTINA AND THE ARGENTINE GENERAL APPROACH TO THE FALKLANDS I MISSED MISTER CORBIN HAS HIS HAS HIS VIEWS WE'VE INVITED HIM TO TO LISTEN TO FALKLAND ISLANDERS SO HE PROPERLY UNDERSTAND SORT OF MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FALKLANDS AND OUR WAY OF LIFE BUT IT'S NOT A THREAT BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S A THREAT
AT THE VICTORY PARTY IN STANLEY THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT AS TO HOW FALKLAND ISLANDERS THEMSELVES IT'S DECKED OUT IN UNION FLAGS HERE THEY REMIND VISITORS THAT THEY VOTED ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY TO REMAIN A BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY IN A REFERENDUM JUST THREE YEARS AGO
IF YOU WONDERFUL TO SEE JEREMY CORGAN COME HERE AS WELL AND THEN MAYBE FIRST HAND HE CAN HE CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ISLANDS AND THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY VOTED FOR IN THE REFERENDUM WAS A CHOICE TO BE BRITISH NO ONE FORCED UPON US AND THE RELATIONSHIP THERE WITH ITS BRILLIANCE AND THEY'RE BEING VERY POSITIVE AND STAUNCH AND ESCORT WHICH ISN'T REALLY HAPPENING FOR US
MANY M.P.S COME DOWN HERE TO GET THE FACTS AND SEE IT FIRST HAND
LIKE HE SAID ROCKS GEMMA CALL THEM BENEFIT A LOT FROM ACTUALLY SEEN WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE GROUND SPEAK AND THE ISLANDERS AND
A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE LIFE HERE IN LINE
MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS ON FROM THE FALKLANDS WAR THESE ISLANDS REMAINED RESOLUTELY BRITISH MICHAEL FALLON SAYS QUESTIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY ARE NOT OPEN FOR DISCUSSION AND THAT IS THE MESSAGE THE LOCALS WANT TO HEAR
JONATHAN BAIL REPORTING FROM THE FALKLANDS IT'S NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND ROB'S BACK WITH AS WELL HER HELLO AGAIN ONE'S LATTER IBRAHIM OF WHICH CELEBRATED HIS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GOAL FOR PAY SOUNDS AGAINST CHELSEA LAST NIGHT AS IF IT WAS ANOTHER MOMENT OF PERSONAL BRILLIANCE
IN FACT IT WAS A FORTUNATELY DEFLECTED FREE KICK OFF CHELSEA'S ME KILL WHO RESPONDED JUST BEFORE HALF TIME WITH THE GOAL OF HIS OWN BUT CHELSEA EVENTUALLY SUCCUMBED TO A SECOND P.S.G. GO FROM SUBSTITUTE EDISON CARAVANNING SO CHELSEA TWO ONE DOWN WITH THE SECOND LEG TO COME AT STAMFORD BRIDGE AND MAYBE JOHN TERRY TO RETURN HIS INTERIM BOSS GOES HEADING
WE HAVE SOME WEEKS TO PREPARE FOR THIS AND I HOPE EVERYONE IS ON BOARD IN THE SECOND LEG OF THIS GAME I ENVY HER BID I MUST SAY THE BENCH OFF FOR VERY STRONG
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN INTERNATIONAL PLACE WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHEN OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY WAS IN THE PARC DE LAST NIGHT TO JOHN A VALUABLE AWAY GOAL IN A TWO ONE DEFEAT THE TRUTH IS THOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL WORSE COULDN'T IT YES I SAT IN THE MEDIA ROOM WITH THE THE TWO CULTURES AFTER THE MATCH LAST NIGHT COS HE TINK AND WARREN PONGA PARISH SAINT
I THINK THEIR RESPECTIVE MOODS TOLD US HOW IT IS BECAUSE CRUSADING WAS ACTUALLY QUITE UPBEAT TALKED OPTIMISTICALLY ABOUT THING ABOUT STILL BEING IN THE RACE IT AS HE PUT IT WHERE IS LAUREN PLONK LOOKED TO ME JUST A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THEY DON'T HAVE A GREATER ADVANTAGE FOR THE SECOND LEG WHICH IS THREE WEEKS TONIGHT AND I THINK THEY COULD EASILY HAVE GONE THE WAY THAT THE MATCH PLAYED OUT PLENTY OF TALK AT THE MOMENT ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT TO CHELSEA WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SITUATION
YES THE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LAST SEASON IS TURNED INTO SOMETHING OF AN ENIGMA THIS SEASON AND I WOULD SAY THOUGH I'M NOT SURE LAST NIGHT WAS THE BEST PLACED TO JUDGE AND BECAUSE CHELSEA WERE UP AGAINST IT FOR FOR LARGE PERIODS
IT'S HOW HE'S BEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON AND IS LEVEL HAS BEEN NOWHERE NEAR THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT HE HIMSELF HAS SET IN THE TIME THAT HE'S BEEN AT CHELSEA IN AND THAT'S WHY THEY DO SEEM TO BE A GROWING FEELING THAT HE MIGHT BE COMING TO THE END OF HIS TIME AT CHELSEA BUT I THINK THE SECOND LEG WILL BE MUCH MORE OF A TIE AND A PLACE TO JUDGE HIM YES WELL IT'S A PIVOTAL WEEK FOR CHELSEA ISN'T IT IF THEY'RE TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS SEASON THEY FACE MANCHESTER CITY IN THE F.A. CUP ON SUNDAY
YES OR WE COULD JUDGE AZAD ON SUNDAY THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO JUDGE HIM AS WELL YES LAST NIGHT'S RESULT THE FACT THAT THEY LOST THE GAME MEANS THAT THE F.A. CUP WHICH WAS ALREADY VERY HIGH ON ON CHELSEA'S AGENDA BECAUSE THE SOFA I DON'T HAVE THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS SEASON MAKES THE F.A. CUP EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OF A QUESTION OVER HOW STRONG IT TEAM MANCHESTER CITY WILL FIELD FOR THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING FOR THEIR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH NEXT WEEK IN UKRAINE THE FOLLOWING DAY
AND CHELSEA WHETHER WE'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA TODAY GOES HE TINK SAID IF JOHN TERRY MIGHT BE FIT TO PLAY IN THAT WHAT HAVING NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME TO PARIS BUT BECAUSE HE DID SO THEY'LL HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH JOHN TERRY YES AND JOHN WHILE YOU'RE ON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE F.A. ZONE SUGGESTION THAT F.A. CUP REPLAY SHOULD BE
SAD I'D BE I'D BE VERY SORRY IF THAT CAME TO PASS I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD IT IS ONLY AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN FLOATED AT THIS STAGE BUT I THINK THEY ARE TESTING THE WATER BUT I CAN ALSO UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT THE CLUBS WOULD BE BETTER OFF
PLAYING FEWER MATCHES TO ANNOUNCE THEIR CHANCES IN THE CHANCES OF THE ENGLAND TEAM AND YOU CAN ONLY REDUCE MATCHES IN THE LEAGUE IF YOU CUT IT TO WAITING TEAMS THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE LEAGUE CUP WHICH DOESN'T HAVE REPLAYS BUT HAS A TWO LEG SEMI FINAL OR THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE IS THE F.A. CUP MIND YOU HOW ABOUT
CUTTING BACK ON THE CLUB'S EVER INCREASING LONG DRAWN OUT FREE AND SOMETIMES POST MATCH TWO HOURS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR THE BIGGEST CLUBS YES THEY DO MAKE A BIT OF MONEY DON'T THEY JOHN MARIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WHAT ELSE WEAR THIS MORNING A BUILDER WILL DRAW TO REPORT BETWEEN CHAMPIONSHIP LEADERS HARLAN THIRD PLACE BRIGHTON WHO ARE THREE POINTS OFF THE TOP AND A POINT BEHIND SECOND PLACE MIDDLESBROUGH RACING TIPS THEN LINGFIELD TO THIRTY FIVE NUMBER FIVE JESS TOASTER TWO TWENTY FIVE NUMBER EIGHT KELSEY
THANK YOU ROB NOW MICHAEL BACKS JOINED US IN THE STUDIO TO TELL US THAT TONIGHT'S MORAL MATES MORNING MICHAEL MORNING MORNING SARAH THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S MUCH PREDICTED MOVE THIS WEEK TO STOP LOCAL COUNCILS AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES FROM BOYCOTTING COMPANIES FOR POLITICAL REASONS MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT SEEM PIFFLING AFTER ALL IF MUCH TRUMPINGTON PARISH COUNCIL STOP SERVING JAFFA ORANGE JUICE IT'S MEETINGS BECAUSE OF ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS ON THE WEST BANK IT'S NOT LIKELY TO CAUSE MUCH TREMBLING IN JERUSALEM BUT THERE ARE BIG ISSUES HERE
THE BOYCOTT DI VESTMENT AND SANCTIONS MOVEMENT WAS GATHERING PACE AND HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS THE ONE AGAINST ISRAEL IS PARTICULARLY POTENT BUT REGARDED BY MANY JEWS AS A MODERN FORM OF ANTI SCIMITARS AND THE GOVERNMENT CALLS IT GESTURE POLITICS THAT UNDERMINES NATIONAL SECURITY BUT THEIR OPPONENT SEE THIS PROJECTED BAN WHICH CARRIES SEVERE PENALTIES AS AN ANTI DEMOCRATIC MOVE THAT EFFECTIVELY MAKES ETHICS ILLEGAL
SHOULD PUBLIC BODIES TAKE ETHICAL STANDS CRITICS WOULD SAY PLAY POLITICAL GAMES BUT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY AND A BOYCOTTS SIR GOOD AND MORAL WAY TO EXPRESS DISAPPROVAL OR A SELF INDULGENT SUBSTITUTE FOR ARGUMENT TOMORROW MAZE AFTER THE NEWS AT EIGHT TONIGHT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MICHAEL AND TO WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE CONTINUE TO BE QUITE CHILLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND KATHY CLARKSTON HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
B.B.C. NEWS HAS BEEN GIVEN DETAILS OF A NEW SCHEME UNDER WHICH MAN WHO POSE A HIGH RISK OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WILL BE OFFERED ONE TO ONE SESSIONS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR THE PROGRAMMERS BAGGED BY TWO DOMESTIC ABUSE CHARITIES AND IT'S BEING PILOTED AN ESSEX SUSSEX ON SOUTH WALES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT EVERY WEEK AND ENGLAND AND WALES TWO WOMEN ARE KILLED BY HER PARTNER OR FORMER PARTNER
BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE ENTER THE FINAL PHASE OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE FUTURE OF THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION OR SUMMAT OF E.U. LEADERS TOMORROW COULD SEE DAVID CAMERON SEALAND AGREEMENT ON CHANGES THIS WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR A BRITISH REFERENDUM POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS JUNE HOWEVER CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT WHETHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL SIGN UP TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S PLAN TO TIGHTEN ACCESS TO WELFARE PAYMENTS WITH DINING STREET KEEN TO ENSURE DRAFT PROPOSALS AREN'T WATER DINE
INSPECTOR SAY CONDITIONS AT LEICESTER PRISON ARE CHAOTIC AND SHABBY DURING A VISIT IN OCTOBER GUARDS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE PRISONERS AND INSPECTOR SAID THEY ROUTINELY FIND IN THERE IT'S WHERE THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE H.M. INSPECTORATE OF PRISONS ALSO SAID THERE WAS A VERY HIGH RATE OF ASSAULTS ON STAFF
A CAMPAIGN GROUP SAYS HIGH STREET COFFEE CHAINS ARE SELLING HOT DRINKS CONTAINING SCANDALOUS AMOUNTS OF SUGAR ACTION ON SUGAR ANALYSED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE FLAVOUR DRINKS IT FIND STARBUCKS LARGE GRIP WITH CHAI HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR PER SERVING WHILE KOSTAS LARGE CHAI LATTE CONTAIN TWENTY TEASPOONS
STARBUCK SAID IT WOULD REDUCE ADDED SUGAR AND WHAT ARE CALLED INDULGENT DRINKS BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS COSTER SAID IT TOOK THE NUTRITIONAL BALANCE OF ITS FOOD AND DRINK VERY SERIOUSLY
THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT HAS PUBLISHED ITS PROPOSALS FOR CHANGING THE B. B. C. IT WANTS NEW GOVERNING ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL AS A SCOTTISH SIX O'CLOCK T.V. NEWS BULLETIN AND A SCOTTISH I PLAYER THE POLICY PAPER IS INTENDED TO INFLUENCE THE RENEWAL OF THE B.B.C.'S ROYAL CHARTER THE CURRENT CHARTER EXPIRES AT THE END OF THIS YEAR
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ARE BADLY OVERCROWDED PRISON WITH HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND WHETHER STAFF SOMETIMES DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THE PRISONERS WERE THAT IS WHAT INSPECTORS HAVE FOUND TO BE THE CASE AT HER MAJESTY'S PRISON LESTER IT'S A HUNDRED FORTY YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTOR'S VISIT IN SEPTEMBER IT WAS HOLDING FIFTY PER CENT MORE INMATES THAN IT WAS BUILT FOR HE IS PART OF WHAT THEY SAID
VERY LITTLE THAT WAS DONE TO PROMOTE SAFETY WAS DUNWELL LEVELS OF VIOLENCE WERE HIGH INCLUDING A VERY HIGH ASSAULT RATE AGAINST STAFF IN OUR SURVEY OVER HALF OF PRISONERS INDICATED THAT THEY HAD FELT UNSAFE IN LEICESTER
THERE WAS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT NEW PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND ALCOHOL WERE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE PRISON WELL OVER HALF OF PRISONERS THOUGHT THEY WERE EASY TO OBTAIN AND YET TOO LITTLE WAS DONE TO DISRUPT SUPPLY
BASIC PROCEDURAL SECURITY WAS POOR STAFF OFTEN COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR PRISONERS AND WE ROUTINELY FOUND PRISONERS WHERE THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
WELL A NEW GOVERNOR HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN LEICESTER SINCE THE INSPECTORS VISITED IN SEPTEMBER SHE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW AND ALWAYS ANYONE FROM THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION OR THE PRISON OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION WE'RE JOINED BY FRANCES CROOK THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HOWARD BEAK FOR PENAL REFORM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO OTHER PRISON REPORTS THAT YOU LOOK AT THEY'RE ALL PRETTY BAD I MEAN I'VE LOOKED BACK OVER HER RECENT REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT AND LEICESTER IS IS AMONGST THE WORST
BUT REPORTS RECENTLY HAVE COME OUT ON FELTON PRISON WHICH HOLDS A TEENAGER BOYS AND THAT'S AT THE BOYS ARE LOCKED UP ALL THE TIME AND IT'S A VERY VIOLENT PLACE THERE'S A REPORT ON HUMBER AND THINK IT'S NOT SAFE THERE'S A LACK OF ACTIVITY AS REPORT ON LIVERPOOL PRISON WHICH WAS FILTHY AND TEN PEOPLE HAD DIED AND DID REPORT GOES ALL THE REPORTS GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW AWFUL THE PRISONS ARE O.K. BUT I'M GOING OUT IN THIS CASE NOT KNOWING WHERE THE PRISONERS WERE
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THAT CAN BE ALLOWED IN SOMEWHERE WHERE THE WHOLE NATURE OF INCARCERATION IS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERYONE IT IS BIZARRE IT'S EXTRAORDINARY AND I THINK THE WORD COMING OUT OF THIS REPORT ON LESTER IS CHAOS BUT MY WORRY IS THAT HAVING PUT A NEW GOVERNOR IN THEY'RE GOING TO THE MINISTERS ARE GOING TO SAY THAT THIS IS AS ALL BEEN SOLVED WHEREAS IT HASN'T THAT'S A STICKING PLASTER THAT'S LIKE GIVING AN ASPIRIN SOME HE'S GOT A BROKEN LEG
IF YOU DON'T SOLVE THE REAL PROBLEM AND YOU JUST APPEAR TO TO GIVE HER SOME SOME SORT OF STICKING PASSER HE WON'T ACTUALLY DO WITH THE PROBLEM YOU MEAN THE NUMBERS THE NUMBERS YOU'VE GOT TO COME DOWN TO THE NUMBERS LOOK WHAT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID LAST WEEK WAS REALLY WELCOME AND WHAT THE NEW SECRETARY OF STATE FOR JUSTICE SAYING HE'S REALLY WELCOME WE HAVE TO OFFER REDEMPTION AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY IT'S A PROBLEM BUT
AND THERE'S A REALLY BIG BUT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'M GOING TO BE COMING TO THE STUDIO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE DYING ONE PERSON EVERY FOUR DAYS TAKES THEIR OWN LIFE IN PRISON AND WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBABLY HAVE TO CONTROL THE COURT'S ABILITY TO SEND PEOPLE TO ON ON REMAND SEVENTY PER CENT OF WHO WON'T GET A PRISON SENTENCE SO WHY THEY'VE BEEN REMINDED TO CUT IF YOU'RE FIRST ON THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
SAID IN RELATION TO THIS THEY SAID NESSA'S REPORT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR AGEING PRISONS NEED REFORM WE WILL BE INVESTING ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS TO TRANSFORM THE PRISON ESTATE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO BETTER SUPPORT REHABILITATION AND TACKLE BULLYING VIOLENCE AND DRUGS THAT TRANSFORMATION OF THE PRISON ESTATE SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD DEAL WITH THE NUMBERS THAT ARE THERE AT THE MOMENT SO THEY ARE NOT OVERCROWDED BECAUSE
THIS SPACE THAT AIR IN WHICH THEY ARE WILL BE DIFFERENT YOU CAN'T BUILD YOUR WAY OUT OF AN OVERCROWDING SYSTEM BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE COURTS FILL THE PRISONS BEFORE THE PRISONS ARE BUILT THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TRIED THIS STATE THEY HAD A HUGE PROGRAMME A PRISON EXPANSION AND WE ARE STILL IN A PRE SYSTEM OF OVERCROWDING YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE FLOW INTO THE PRISON
YOU HAVE TO REDUCE REMANDS YOU HAVE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING IN A SHORT SENTENCES BECAUSE THEY'RE A NUISANCE NOT BECAUSE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A PARTICULAR PROBLEM AT LEICESTER BECAUSE IT WAS A BIT OF RESIN AND THERE WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGGING PEOPLE WHO ARE ANNOYING WE SHOULDN'T BE SENDING THEM TO PRISON AND WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE MAGISTRATES ABILITY TO USE PRISON FOR THESE PEOPLE BUT WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS OUTLINED IN THIS SHAKE UP OF OF PRISONS I MEAN IT IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
ISN'T IT I MEAN YOU ARE CHOOSING TO FOCUS ON OVERCROWDING BUT THIS IS THIS IS A BIG PROGRAMME TO TRY AND TACKLE SOME OF THE WORST ISSUES AS A SOAP AND THE LAST GOVERNOR TRIED EXACTLY THE SAME THING AND IT DIDN'T WORK YOU CANNOT BUILD YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS NEW
MODERN PRISONS ARE OFTEN JUST AS DANGEROUS AND OVERCROWDED AS THE OLD PRISONS IT'S NOT THE BUILDINGS THAT HAVE THE PROBLEM IF IT WAS THE VICTORIAN PRISONS THAT WERE THE BUILDINGS A PROBLEM UCOS OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITIES IT'S NOT THE BUILDINGS IT'S THE OVERCROWDING AND IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM THEN THEY WON'T FIND A PROPER SOLUTION FRANCIS CRICK CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM THANK YOU
THE TIMES TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND TO THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE IS PICTURED ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES AFTER DENIALS BY ROYAL OFFICIALS THAT A SPEECH HE MADE YESTERDAY SIGNAL SUPPORT FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. THE PAPER SAYS KENSINGTON PALACE HAS BEEN EMBARRASSED BY THE ROW THE TELEGRAPH BELIEVES HIS REMARKS COULDN'T BE SEEN AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE E.U. BUT THE PAPER SAYS THAT'S THAT'S GOVERNMENT POLICY AND THE DUKE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO REFLECT IT
NOT EVERYONE HAD THE SAME MESSAGE THE PRINCE SAID BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN OUTWARD LOOKING NATION THAT ASSAULT SOUGHT TO EXPLORE WHAT IS BEYOND THE HORIZON SAYS THE DAILY MAIL IN OTHER WORDS BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FREE TRADING NATION AT ITS BEST WE'RE NOT CONFINED BY THE NARROW STALINIST OVER REGULATED AND ARTHRITIC EUROPEAN UNION WE COULDN'T HAVE PUT IT BETTER STAY OUT OF IT THE SUN TELLS PRINCE WILLIAM THE ROYALS MUST REMAIN NEUTRAL THEY CANNOT TAKE SIDES IN THE E.U. DEBATE
BRITAIN HAS A GAMBLING PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE PAPER DESCRIBES IT AS AN EPIDEMIC ONE SO SERIOUS THAT THE N.H.S. HAS STARTED PRESCRIBING TEN THOUSAND A YEAR THAT DRUGS FOR SOME OF THE WORST ADDICTS IN AN EDITORIAL THE PAPER DEMANDS ACTION TO TACKLE THE RISER FIXED ODDS BETTING MACHINES DESCRIBING THEM AS THE SCOURGE OF IMPOVERISHED NEIGHBOURHOODS AND VULNERABLE FAMILIES GAMBLING ADDICT IMPACT THE LIVES OF ALL AROUND THEM SAYS THE TIMES THE MACHINES A DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND SHOULD BE REGULATED AS SUCH
THE WORD EPIDEMIC CROPS UP AGAIN IN THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH USES IT TO DESCRIBE WHAT'S SAID TO BE A MASSIVE RISE IN THE NUMBER OF SICK PUPPIES BEING SMUGGLED INTO BRITAIN PUTS A TOTAL OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED A DAY OR ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND A YEAR AND SAYS THE REASON IS SOARING DEMAND FOR DESIGNER DOGS THE DOGS ARE SAID TO COME FROM ILLEGAL FARMS IN EASTERN EUROPE AND IRELAND BRITAIN SUPPOSED TO BE A NATION OF ANIMAL LOVERS LOVERS THE PAPER SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IN THE E.U. SHOULD UPDATE LAWS TO STAMP OUT THIS CRUELTY
ANOTHER SCHOOL IS IN THE NEWS FOR HAVING TO TAKE PARENTS OFF ABOUT THEIR CONDUCT AT THE SCHOOL GATES LAST MONTH IT WAS A PLEA NOT TO WEAR PYJAMAS TODAY VIRTUALLY ALL THE PAPERS REPORT ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIMARY SCHOOL IN GREATER MANCHESTER THAT'S WRITTEN TO PARENTS ASKING THEM NOT TO SMOKE CANNABIS WHILE DROPPING OFF AND PICKING UP CHILDREN IT IS AN APPALLING WAY TO BEHAVE SAYS THE DAILY EXPRESS THOSE TAKING THE DRUGS SHOULD BE ASHAMED IN A JUST WORLD THEY'D GET A VISIT FROM THE POLICE THE SUN CALLS THE PARENTS DOPEY
IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING LIKE THAT TROUBLE THE AUTHORITIES AT OUR LADY SCHOOL AT ABINGDON IN OXFORDSHIRE IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AT THE REQUEST OF AN AMERICAN SCHOLAR SAYS THE GUARDIAN THE SCHOOL HAS JUST SEARCHED ITS ARCHIVES FOR A NINETEEN THIRTY SIX EDITION OF ITS MAGAZINE THE ABINGDON CHRONICLE AND IT FOUND TWO UNKNOWN POEMS BY J. R. R. TOLKIEN
THE HEAD TEACHER STEVE NONE OF US IS A GREAT TOLKIEN FAN WAS THRILLED TO DISCOVER THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL HE SAYS THE POEMS ONE CALLED THE SHADOW MAN AND A CHRISTMAS POEM CALLED NOEL A VERY ATMOSPHERIC AND IMBUED WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY THE TIME IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT A MATHS TEACHER FROM WEMBLEY IS DOWN TO THE FINAL TEN IN THIS YEAR'S GLOBAL TEACHER PRICE IF HE WINS HE'LL BE GIVEN A MILLION DOLLARS AND BE CONSIDERED THE BEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD
HE WAS NOMINATED IN PART BECAUSE OF THE MATHS VIDEOS THAT HE PUTS ONLINE ORIGINALLY THEY WERE TO ALLOW JUST ONE OF HIS PUPILS WHO WAS ILL TO CATCH UP BUT THEY'VE NOW BEEN VIEWED OVER FIVE MILLION TIMES AND ALL OVER THE WORLD HERE'S A SECTION
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF GET RID OF SOME NEGATIVE THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ABOUT MATHS O.K. A LOT OF STUDENTS ON TWITTER AND YOUTUBE SAY THEY'RE LOW IN MATHS CONFIDENCE THEY'RE NOT SURE THEY CAN DO IT THEY DON'T LIKE MATHS EXCEPT RID YOURSELF OF THOSE THOUGHTS O.K.
YOU'VE GOT TO START OFF ON A LEVEL FOOTY YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WORK HARD AND YOU'RE DEDICATED YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MATHS
COLIN HEGARTY THERE WHO NORMALLY TEACHES MATHS AT PRESTON MANOR SCHOOL THIS MORNING HE JOINS US FROM SALFORD THERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND RAMMED SARAH CONGRATULATIONS OH THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S I'M FLABBERGASTED
OR YOU WERE THOUGH I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY WON AWARDS FOR YOUR TEACHING IN THE U.K. BEFORE YEAH IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WON THE U.K. TEACHING AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING USE OF TECHNOLOGY SO I'VE BEEN LUCKY BEFORE RIGHT AND NOW YOU WE HEARD YOU IN THAT CLIP REALLY CAN ANYONE DO MELT ABSOLUTELY SARAH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT I THINK WITH MATHS IT IT
LIKE WITH MOST IN MOST THINGS IN LIFE IT'S A CONFIDENCE ISSUE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN MATTERS EITHER RIGHT OR WRONG I THINK STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE A WRONG ANSWER A FEW TIMES INTERNALISE IT I THINK THEY'RE BAD AT MATHS THEN GIVE UP AND THEN ACTUALLY FOR PHIL THAT PROPHECY AND THEY BECOME BAD AT MATHS
BUT MATHS LIKE ANYTHING JUST NEEDS A BIT OF HARD WORK DETERMINATION AND CONFIDENCE AND YOU CAN DEFINITELY DO IT I SUPPOSE ALSO THEY MAY BE AFFECTED BY THEIR PARENTS SAYING I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD AT MATHS I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT I THINK SOMETIMES YOU KNOW IN THE U.K. WE WEE TENT
IT ALLOWS SENTENCES LIKE I WAS NEVER GOOD AT MATHS AND LAUGH IT OFF WHEREAS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE OH CASE SO IT'S PARTLY DOWN TO THE TEACHING OF COURSE WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU A GOOD TEACHER
I THINK IT COMES FROM MY CHILDHOOD FIRSTLY MY PARENTS I'M FROM HUMBLE BACKGROUNDS AND MY PARENTS I WAS SO LUCKY AT MY DAD'S A BUILDER EVERY DAY AFTER WORK HE READ TO ME MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME MY TIMES TABLES AND WALK THE ROAD LEARNING MY GERMAN VOCABULARY SO THEY TAUGHT ME EDUCATION WAS THE THE WAY TO IMPROVE MY LIFE CHANCES
I BELIEVE THAT I LOVE LEARNING AND I LOVE SHARING THE GIFT OF LEARNING WITH OTHER CHILDREN IT'S MY HUGE PASSION SO I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IF ANYTHING IS IS IS WHAT MAKES ME DECENT
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE IS SOMETHING THAT SAL KHAN RATHER FAMOUSLY DID YOU PUT A VIDEO ONLINE AND DISCOVERED THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE USE THEM BUT YOU USE YOUR OWN VIDEOS USED FLIP YOUR CLASSROOM DON'T YOU HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE VIDEOS AND THEN YOU CAN
AS AS THEIR HOMER EXACTLY YEAH ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO I STARTED AT A STUDENT I TAUGHT WHO HIS DAD WAS ILL AND HAD TO BE WITH HIS DAD FOR TWO MONTHS AT THE START OF HIS A. LEVELS SO I KNEW ABOUT SAL KHAN AYE AYE LOOK A NEW TUBE TO TO TRY AND FIX MY CAR IF IT'S BROKEN SO IT MADE SENSE TO IT TO MAKE HIS MATHS A. LEVEL AVAILABLE TIM HIM ONLINE
AND I FLIPPED THE CLASSROOM WITH WITH ALL MY A. LEVEL CLASS THAT YEAR AND WE WE ACTUALLY GOT THE BEST DAY LEVEL RESULTS AT G.C.S.E. RESULTS IN THE SCHOOL EVER SO IT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT THEY WANT THEY'LL WATCH THE VIDEOS AT HOME AND THEN WHEN THEY COME IN YOU CAN DO THE MATHS PROBLEMS BASED ON THOSE WITH YES HE EXACTLY SARAH AND I THINK WITH MATHS I FIND IN LIFE AS WELL YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL SOMEONE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IT'S QUITE AN AWKWARD SOCIAL SITUATION SO IMAGINE WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD AND YOU HAVE TO ASK SEVERAL TIMES YOU DON'T GET THINGS
BEING ABLE TO GO HOME AND WATCH THAT VIDEO MAYBE TWENTY TIMES OR WHATEVER IT TAKES TO JUST GET THAT LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA SUPPORT YOU NEED I THINK REALLY LIBERATES CHILDREN AND GIVES THEM THAT CONFIDENCE TO COME INTO THE CLASS PREPARED READY TO LEARN THEM READY TO YOU KNOW SUCCEED COLIN HAGGERTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD LUCK WITH HOPEFULLY WINNING THAT MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU SARAH
THE TIME IS A QUARTER TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND OXFORD STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING LAST NIGHT THE GENERAL SYNOD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND PASSED A MOTION CALLING ON ALL PARISHES TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GIVE BLOOD AND TO REGISTER OF ORGAN DONORS
THOSE WHO PUT THE MOTION FORWARD WERE WELL AWARE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AFTER A TRAUMATIC DEATH FOR RELATIVES TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR ORGANS TO BE USED UNLESS THE DECEASED HAS ALREADY REGISTERED AS A DONOR
SOME YEARS AGO I WAS TEACHING A MASTERS COURSE ON CONTEMPORARY SPIRITUALITY A STUDENT CHOSE A SUBJECT FOR HER DISSERTATION THE SPIRITUALITY OF BLOOD NATION SHOULD BEEN A DONOR HERSELF FOR MANY YEARS AND WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT MOTIVATED OTHER PEOPLE TO GO TO THE TIME AND TROUBLE OF DONATING BLOOD
AFTER A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH FELLOW DONORS SHE DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THEM DID SO OUT OF A STRONG SENSE OF ALTRUISM THEY'RE SURPRISE THERE PERHAPS BUT THEY ALSO FELT THAT BY DOING SO THEY HAD AN ALMOST MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF UNITY WITH THE UNKNOWN RECIPIENTS WHICH THEY FOUND PROFOUNDLY MOVING AND HUMBLING
SHE SUGGESTED THAT BLOOD TO NATION SHOULD BE SEEN AS A FORM OF SECULAR SPIRITUALITY SOMETHING WHICH ANYONE COULD DO WHATEVER THEIR BELIEFS AND WHICH COULD TRANSFORM THEIR LIFE
THERE'S NOTHING MORE INTIMATE THAN BLOOD NOTHING MORE ESSENTIAL TO LIFE THAN THE ORGANS WHICH MAINTAIN US NO WONDER BLOOD IS REGARDED AS SACRED SACRED US CAN WORK BOTH WAYS EITHER TO PREVENT US FROM SHARING A BLOOD OR ENCOURAGING US TO DO SO
BLOOD DONATION HAS HELPED US DISCOVER BLOOD AS THE GREAT LEVELLER IT HAS GROUPS OF ITS OWN WHICH MIX OR DON'T MIX WITH OTHERS AND THE RARE GROUPS ARE PARTICULARLY NEEDED BUT THEY DON'T SIGNIFY ANY SPECIAL MERIT THERE'S NO ARISTOCRACY IN THE BLOOD NO REAL BLUE BLOOD
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC MIRACLE THAT WE CAN EXCHANGE BLOOD AND ORGANS I REMEMBER SEEING THE LITTLE GIRL ON THE B.B.C. PROGRAMMES ABOUT GREAT ORMOND STREET WHO'D RECEIVED NEW LUNGS FROM A DONOR WHO DIED IN AN ACCIDENT SHE WAS TOUCHINGLY AWARE OF THE GIFT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN AND DETERMINED TO LIVE HER LIFE TO THE FULL AND SOME STRANGE I HAVE TO USE THE WORD MYSTICAL AGAIN SHE FELT SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING PART OF THE DONOR'S LIFE ONWARDS
I FIND IN THIS EXPERIENCE CONFIRMATION OF THE INSIGHT OF FAITH THAT HUMANITY IS ESSENTIALLY ONE BEYOND RACE AND ETHNICITY
THE CHRISTIAN FAITH TAKES THIS INSIGHT TO EXTREMES I WORSHIP CENTRES ON THE MYSTICAL RECEPTION OF THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST SHARING HIS BODY MAKES US ONE WITH EACH OTHER HOLY COMMUNION
IN THE END WE ARE EITHER ATOMISED INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT CONNECT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND CAN ONLY COMPETE OR COMPEL EACH OTHER WE ARE LINKED IN OUR VERY BEING LIVING EACH OTHER'S LIFE DYING EACH OTHER'S
THAT'S WHAT MY FAITH THE FIRMS AND WHAT THOSE WHO GIVE BLOOD DISCOVER FOR THEMSELVES
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CANNON ANGELA TILL B. THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN TOLD THAT IT CAN DELIVER AID FROM TODAY TO SEVEN BESIEGED TOWNS IN SYRIA SOME OF THEM LIKE THE DIRE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF STARVATION OR SURROUNDED BY GOVERNMENT FORCES A COUPLE OF THE TOWNS THEY WERE BESIEGED BY REBEL GROUPS AND ONE WHERE THERE WILL BE AN AIRDROP IS SURROUNDED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE EIGHT DELIVERY NEGOTIATED WITH THE VARIOUS PARTIES COMES AHEAD OF WHAT IS HOPE WILL BE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BY ALL SIDES IN THIS FIVE YEAR OLD WAR A CORRESPONDENT LENA CINCH SIN JAB HAS FROM BEIRUT IN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE LIVING UNDER SIEGE BOTH FROM PRO GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION FORCES
THIS IS A CRUCIAL WEEK FOR SYRIA SEVEN DAYS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DELIVER ON ITS AIM OF SUSPENDING THE FIGHTING AND RESTARTING THE DELIVERY OF FOOD TO PEOPLE
IT'S NOW A MONTH SINCE THE TRUCK'S MEET THE LONGEST MADE A DELIVERY OF EIGHT
SIXTEEN PEOPLE HAVE STARVED TO DEATH SINCE THEN ACCORDING TO DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED IN THE TOWN BESIEGED BY PRO GOVERNMENT FORCES THE LAVA
MY SISTER HASN'T HAD FOOD FOR MY MOMENT THAT I'LL GET THAT THEN I'M GOING IN AND THE RED CROSS THE YOU WON'T NEED TO HELP US
HER SISTER IS AN UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN UNABLE TO GET MEDICAL HELP UNABLE TO GET FOOD BECAUSE OF THE SIEGE LEYLA NOT HER REAL NAME TOLD ME THAT FOR AGES NO BEING SAW THAT EXORBITANT PRICES I'M GOING TO THAT THOSE FOOTBALL SINCE ADAM L. BEING SOUGHT FOR EIGHT HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS
PEOPLE ARE SAYING GET ON WE DIDN'T GET ALL THE AID THAT WAS DELIVERED SOMEONE STOLEN SOMEONE SAW THAT WHAT WE ACTUALLY DECEIVED WAS VERY LITERATE YOU'RE SAYING IN THE FORD WERE STOLEN ALMOST ALL THERE FOR YOU ALL GOT IT FROM YOU
LIKE IT WAS ADAM GANGS I CAN'T GIVE YOU NAMES EVERYONE KNOWS WHO STOLE IT ONCE IT WAS DELIVERED LATER LATER TOLD ME WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE SHE BLAMED BOTH SIDES PRO GOVERNMENT FIGHTERS OUTSIDE THE TOWN ANT REBELS INSIDE MOTHER
BOTH SHE SAID ARE PROFITING BY SELLING STOLEN FOOD
WOOD JUST ANOTHER WHOPPING OFF WARD IN SYRIA GOVERNMENT AND REBELS FORCES BESIEGING TOWNS STARVING THOUSANDS OF FEW BOB
HE'S SURROUNDED BY OPPOSITION FIGHTERS IT DID RECEIVE SOME AIR DROPS OF AID BUT NO LONGER
HE SAYS WIFE AND SIX CHILDREN I'D TRY THERE YEAH IT IT'S AS IF YOU'RE GIVING A CLOCK AFLOAT AT WORTH S.T. MAN THE FORWARD QUANTITIES DELIVERED A ARE VERY SMALL AND NOT ENOUGH TO FEED A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION
HOW DOES IT FEEL FOR YOU THAT'S YOUR FAMILY IS THERE THEY ARE BESIEGED THEM THEY NEED FOOD ANY MARK ON THE WORK I HAVE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS THINKING OFF BY CHILDREN AND ALL THEIR CHILDREN OFF WHAT THE PEOPLE ONLY HAD A GLASS OF MILK AND THEY CAN'T HAVE IT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO LIFT THE SIEGE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MOVE IN AND OUT SAFELY BUT THE WAR HAS INTENSIFIED IN THE LAST WEEK
THE LAST SIX DAYS RUSSIAN PLANES HAVE HIT MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED TARGETS IN SYRIA
THE INCREASED TEMPLE OF THE WALL IS MAKING IT HARD FOR AID DELIVERIES IN THE U.N. IS ASKING FOR UNHINDERED ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES THEY'VE BEEN HELL
AXIS THAT CAN ONLY BE GIVEN BY AGREEMENT FROM ALL THE WARRING PARTIES
THIS WEEK HE'S SUPPOSED TO SEE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN SYRIA THAT'S WHAT WAR POWERS IN MUNICH AGREED LAST FRIDAY DELIVERY OF EIGHT WOULD BE A STEP TOWARDS THAT WALL
LAILA AND OTHER SYRIANS ON THE SEAT FORWARD IS A PRIORITY BUT THEY NEED SO MUCH MORE ALL RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT TO US WE HAVE NO IDEA THAT TOMORROW WILL BRING
LENA'S SIN JAB REPORTING THERE WAS STEPHEN IRAN IS THE UNITED NATIONS UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE UN HAS PLANS FOR TODAY
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT AS OF YESTERDAY THE AUTHORISATION WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNOR OF SYRIA TO DELIVER ASSISTANCE TO RESORT NOW THAT'S THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BESIEGED BY I SELL OVER IN THE EAST I THINK A FRIAR DEFER THOSE THE TWO TOWNS AND IT LEARNT WHICH BESIEGED BY
ARMED OPPOSITION GROUPS ANDREW TO MY DIET AND ZEBRA DALI WHICH ARE PARTLY SO CALLED FORT TOWNS AS WELL AS CUFF AND WHY DIDN'T IT THAT EACH AND EVERY CONVOY IT'S GOT TO BE VERY CAREFULLY PREPARED
THE TRUCK'S GOT WE'RE LOADED WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT ENOUGH AT THE RIGHT MATERIALS ON THE TRUCKS BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE GREAT THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR THIS THE SUPPORT TO GET THROUGH AND THE TOWNS ARE TALKING ABOUT A BESIEGED IT RIPPED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PLACES HOW HAS THE ARRANGEMENT BIN THAT YOU CAN FOR EXAMPLE GET INTO AN AREA CONTROLLED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
WELL ON THAT ONE NO IT HASN'T BEEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE AND SO THAT WILL BE
AFTER VERY CAREFUL PREPARATION COS IT'S VERY COMPLEX AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE GOOD TRADING UP'S A GOOD APPROACH IS TO GET AIR DROPS IN AT PTEROSAUR AREA BUT THE OTHERS
BESIEGED BY THE ARMED OPPOSITION GROUP SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD REASON WHY WE HAVE TO HELP THESE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ALL THE PARTIES AND YOU SAW IN THAT PACKAGE THAT
LEAVE US IN JEB REFERRED TO RETIRE WHERE WE GOT IN MONTHS AGO WITH A MONTH OF SUPPLIER SO OF COURSE WE NEED TO GET IN TODAY TORRENTIAL WE CAN GET MORE SUPPLIES
JUST TO GIVE A VERY CLEAR EXAMPLES WHERE WHEN WE GET AGREEMENT FROM THE GUMS OF SYRIA BECAUSE THAT IS BESIEGED BY THE GOVERNOR TO SYRIA WHERE WE GET THE FIRST'S ABOUT SAY SIX OR EIGHT CHECKPOINTS ON THE ROAD TO
YOU THEN HAVE TO ALSO NEGOTIATE WITH HIS BROTHER WHO CHECKPOINT THE LAST TWO OR THREE ON THE OUTER RIM OF THE TARP IF WE GET IT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP THERE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE TRUCKS TO BE LOOTED YOU WANT TO GET THE TRUCKS SO THAT DISTRIBUTION PROPERLY SUPERVISE CAN REACH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE GRAVEST NEED AND GROUPERS RESPONSIBILITY AND IS WHAT IS BEING SENT IN AS THAT MAN SAID A DROP OF WATER TO A THIRSTY MAN
WITHOUT IT IT'S EVEN WORSE BUT THE QUANTITIES THAT ARE BEING LOADED ONTO TRUCKS ARE AS YOU HEARD FROM THEM AT OUR EXAMPLE THESE SUFFICED FOR HIM UP
THE TROUBLE IS A MONTH PASSES SURPRISINGLY QUICKLY AND YOU NEED TO GET THE RESUPPLY IAN IT'S VERY WORRYING THAT FOR INSTANCE IN A PLACE LIKE KAFFIR BATON UH OH THE U.N. HAS NOT HAD PROPER ACCESS THERE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS SO WHEN WE GET THERE
THEY VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THE WHEELS WILL ROLL IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AS WE SPEAK THAT IS ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TO FIND WHAT WE FIND WE DREAD OF COURSE WHAT WE'LL FIND BUT AFTER TWO YEARS THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT'S BEEN BROKEN WHEN I WAS LAST IN SERIOUS WEEKS GO
I JOINED THE CONVOYS GOING ACROSS THE LINE THESE ARE EXTREMELY FRAGILE DANGEROUS THINGS TO DO AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A LOT OF ROOMS TALK ABOUT LITERALLY A ROPE SUSPENDED ACROSS A PIECE OF ROAD IT'S THAT CLOSE WE'RE IN POPULATED AREAS WHICH IS WHY
ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT
SHELLING AND BOMBING GETS INDISCRIMINATE ON CIVILIANS IS SO SEVERE SO SUCH A WORRY AND OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS NOT DONE WITH THOUGH THERE IS NO COMMUNITY THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE THE EVIDENCE IS GATHERED WE MUST RECOGNISE THAT THIS IS THE PARTIES WERE PERPETRATING A TALK CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND INDEED AS YOU HEARD FROM MANY PARTIES
SUBJECT THE EVIDENCE CAN BE WAR CRIMES COULD PRESIDENT ASSAD'S STOP THIS TOMORROW IF HE WANTED TO ALL PARTIES COULD STOP THIS TOMORROW IT HAS TO BE A RECOGNITION THAT IF THERE IS A SUSPENSION OF HOSTILITIES OR IF THERE IS ANY IT'S A CONTINUATION OF THE
THE FIGHT BY VIOLENCE THAT IS NOT GOING TO THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO LEAD TO A RESULT IT'S A SESSION OF HOSTILITIES WHICH CAN GROW THEIR CONFIDENCE THAT ENABLE THE PARTIES TO GET TO TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CONSTRUCT A FUTURE
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD AND THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IT APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING TO ALLOW AID INTO THE COUNTRY AND THEN WHAT THE FIGHTING STARTS AGAIN NO LET'S BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THE OBLIGATION FOR
THE AID FOR THE RELIEF FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED LIFESAVING
FOR THE PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS THAT AS IS AS A MATTER OF LAW IS SOMETHING WHICH ALL PARTIES TO A FIGHT ARE REQUIRED TO GRANT SAFE AND UNIMPEDED ACCESS AT ALL TIMES THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONAL CONDITIONAL TO ABILITY THAT IS THE LAW AND THIS IS WHAT WE DID MARK STEPHEN O'BRIEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

DARRYL BECOMES A SYMBOL OF THE FRENCH CAPACITY TO DEFEND THEIR SOIL NO MATTER WHAT THEIR DOWN THE SACRED WOUND ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR BEGINS THIS MORNING AT ELEVEN
IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THE PROGRAMME MY CHILDREN IN ENGLAND ARE AMONGST THE UNHAPPIEST IN THE WORLD AND ROB BONNET ON WHETHER GOLF IS GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES A SCHEME TO PREVENT HUNDREDS OF MEN CARRYING OUT DOMESTIC ABUSE IS GETTING UNDER WAY IN ENGLAND AND WALES BRITISH DIPLOMATS ARE MAKING FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS TOMORROW WHICH COULD SEE A NEW SETTLEMENT FOR THE U.K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT'S EMERGED THAT SOME HOT FLAVOURED DRINKS SERVED IN HIGH STREET CAFES CAN CONTAIN UP TO TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLARKSTON B.B.C. NEWS HAS BEEN GIVEN DETAILS OF A NEW SCHEME UNDER WHICH MAN WHO POSE A HIGH RISK OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WILL BE OFFERED SUPPORT TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR THE PROGRAMME KNOWN AS DRIVE IS BACKED BY TWO DOMESTIC ABUSE CHARITIES SAVE LIVES AND RESPECT AND AS BEING PILOTED AN ESSEX SUSSEX AND SOUTH WALES
ONE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND WALES SO THEY'VE BEEN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE LAST YEAR WITH TWO WOMEN KILLED EVERY WEEK HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
THE DRIVE PROGRAMME FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS IS AIMED AT DANGEROUS OFFENDERS INCLUDING THOSE THOUGHT TO BE AT RISK OF CAUSING SERIOUS HARM OR COMMITTING MURDER UNLIKE MOST EXISTING SCHEMES WHICH INVOLVE GROUP WORK OR FAMILY THERAPY OFFENDERS ON THE DRIVE PROGRAMME WILL BE GIVEN BESPOKE ONE TO ONE SESSIONS THEY'LL BE OFFERED SUPPORT TO ADDRESS ANY ALCOHOL DRUGS OR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THEY MAY HAVE ADVICE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND PARENTING WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE
THOSE WHO REFUSED TO CO OPERATE WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY BY POLICE CIVIL COURT ORDERS AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED TO DISRUPT THEIR OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR IT'S AN AMBITIOUS IDEA WHICH WILL BE TRIED OUT ON NINE HUNDRED OFFENDERS IN THREE AREAS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE ENTERED THE FINAL PHASE OF NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD OF THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT TOMORROW WHICH COULD SEE DAVID CAMERON SEAL AN AGREEMENT ON CHANGES TO THE U.K.'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT WHETHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL SIGN UP TO THEIR PLAN TO TIGHTEN ACCESS TO WELFARE PAYMENTS WITH DOWNING STREET KEEN TO ENSURE DRAFT PROPOSALS AREN'T WATER DINE
IF Y. U. LEADERS APPROVE A DEAL THE REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP COULD BE HELD AS EARLY AS JUNE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
THE NEGOTIATIONS SURROUNDING THE DEAL HAVE REACHED A DIFFICULT STAGE HIS OFFICIALS HAGGLE OVER A REVISED DRAFT TO PRESENT TO THEIR PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS THE CURRENT TEXT INSIST THAT THIS WILL BE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT SO EVERY WORD MATTERS THERE ARE STILL DISPUTES ABOUT THE SCOPE AND THE EXACT NATURE OF RESTRICTIONS ON WELFARE BENEFITS FOR CITIZENS FROM OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE U.K.
IN ADDITION FRANCE IS JUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES ANXIOUS TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IN THE DEAL WOULD ALLOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE CITY OF LONDON TO BENEFIT FROM LIGHTER REGULATIONS THAN THEIR CONTINENTAL COUNTERPARTS
MOST DIPLOMAT SEEM CONFIDENT THAT A DEAL CAN BE DONE THIS WEEK NOT LEAST BECAUSE MOST OF THEIR POLITICAL MASTERS WANT TO FOCUS ON OTHER ISSUES NOTABLY THE MIGRATION CRISIS THAT MEANS WE COULD NOW ON FRIDAY EVENING WHEN THE REFERENDUM WILL BE HELD TO DECIDE WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS IN THE E.U. OR LEAVES
A CAMPAIGN GROUP HAS WARNED THAT THERE'S AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOT FLAVOUR DRINK SERVED IN HIGH STREET CAFES ACTION ON SUGAR TESTED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE DIFFERENT DRINKS IT FIND THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FIVE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR IN STARBUCKS VENTI GRIP WITH CHAI ORANGE AND CINNAMON HOT MULLED FRUIT A LARGE LATTE CHAI FROM COSTA CONTAINS TWENTY TEASPOONS
BOTH COMPANIES SAY THEY'RE COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THERE DRINKS ONE OF THE NUTRITIONISTS WHO COMPILED A REPORT FOR HASHIM TOLD US SHE WAS SHOCKED BY THE RESULTS
THESE PRODUCTS ARE THE LARGER PORTION SIZES BUT EVEN THOSE THAT'S OUR REGULAR STANDARD PORTION SIZES STILL HAVE ABOUT FIFTY GRAMS OF SUGAR AND WE WERE SURPRISED WITH THAT EYE I HAD ASSUMED IT WOULD BE PROBABLY HALF THAT AMOUNT NOT EXPECTING GET TO SOME PRODUCTS TO CONTAIN NINETY NINE GRAMS OF SUGAR
INSPECTORS HAVE SEVERELY CRITICISED CONDITIONS AT LEICESTER PRISON SAYING THAT DURING THEIR VISIT TO STAFF WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND SOME OF THE INMATES IN A REPORT THEY SAID THE MAIN WING WAS OFTEN CHAOTIC AND THERE WAS A VERY HIGH RATE OF ASSAULTS ON STAFF LAST WEEK THE PRIME MINISTER SET OUT PLANS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND REOFFENDING IN ENGLAND AND WALES MORE DETAILS FROM NICK BEAK
DAVID CAMERON HAS PROMISED THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP OF PRISONS SINCE THE VICTORIAN ERA THE PICTURE PAINTED AT LESTER SUGGEST IT'S BADLY NEEDED INSPECTORS DESCRIBED THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR OLD PRISON AS CHAOTIC AND SHABBY AND CALLED THE SEGREGATION UNIT TERRIBLE AND SAID IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN
LEVELS OF VIOLENCE WERE THREE TIMES THAT FOUND IN OTHER CATEGORY B. PRISONS SELF HARM WAS FIVE TIMES HIGHER DURING THE UNANNOUNCED INSPECTION LAST AUTUMN STAFF WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE SOME PRISONERS THERE WAS NO EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR IMPROVEMENT THE NATIONAL OFFENDERS MANAGEMENT SERVICE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRISONS CONCEDED THIS WAS A DISAPPOINTING REPORT AND SAID A NEW GOVERNOR HAD BEEN APPOINTED WHO WOULD NOW TRY TO TURN THINGS ROUND
AN ASSOCIATION OF NURSERY SCHOOLS AND ENGLAND SAYS FEWER THAN HALF OF ITS MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO OFFER EXTENDED FREE CHILDCARE OURS PLANNED BY THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF FUNDING SHORTFALLS THEIR NATIONAL DAY NURSERY ASSOCIATION SAYS MANY ALREADY STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN STATE FUNDED HOURS A WEEK AND CAN'T AFFORD TO OFFER THIRTY HOURS
THE ASSOCIATION'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE PRINNY METALLICA TOLD US NURSES WERE LOSING ABOUT ONE PINT SIXTY EIGHT ON THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND COSTS WERE RISING BECAUSE A FACTOR SUCH AS THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN THE SPENDING REVIEW ABOUT FUNDING DOESN'T COME UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN EXISTING FOR A NUMBER AFIA'S IN TERMS OF THE CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING UP THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME AND THAT'S WHY THE NURSERIES ARE ACTUALLY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE EXTENDED HOURS IN FUTURE
GRACE SAYS THAT HAS FINISHED WORK ON FOR MIGRANT SCREENING FACILITIES THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED FOR ITS BORDER CONTROLS AND THE NEW CENTRE IS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR GREEK OFFICIALS TO HANDLE THE MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD THERE TO REACH THE E.U. FROM ATHENS JAMES REYNOLDS REPORTS
AT THE START OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND OVERWHELMED GREECE WAVED THROUGH MANY MIGRANTS WITHOUT PROPER CHECKS
AFTER MANY DELAYS THIS COUNTRY HAS NOW FINALLY OPENED FOUR OF THE FIVE MIGRANT SCREENING CENTRES IT PROMISED TO BUILD ON ITS ISLANDS THE CENTRES ARE KNOWN AS HOT SPOTS OR NEW MIGRANTS WILL BE TAKEN TO ONE OF THESE HOT SPOTS TO BE PROCESSED THOSE DEEMED TO BE REFUGEES ESCAPING WAR WILL BE ALLOWED TO CARRY ON THEIR JOURNEYS TO THE REST OF EUROPE THOSE CLASSIFIED AS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS WILL BE STOPPED AND MAY EVENTUALLY BE DEPORTED
U.N. CONVOYS ARE EXPECTED TO DELIVER SUPPLIES TO COMMUNITIES AND SYRIA THAT NEED URGENT HELP INCLUDING THE CITY OF MY DIRE WERE DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY THOUGHT TO HAVE STARVED TO DEATH ALLOWING HUMANITARIAN ACCESS TO BESIEGED ARIUS WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF A DEAL REACHED IN MUNICH LAST WEEK BUT CONTINUED BOMBING HAS DIMMED HOPES FOR A CEASEFIRE OUR CORRESPONDENT MESSENGER IS FOLLOWING EVENTS FROM BEIRUT
THE U.N. IS AIMING TO DELIVER AID TO FIVE DIFFERENT BESIEGED AREAS OR SYRIA TODAY THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN APPROVAL BY THE GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION GROUPS TO ALLOW THEIR TEAMS AND THE RED CHRISTENED TO DELIVER AID TRUCKS HAD EXPECTED TO REACH COMMUNITIES IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SYRIA SIMULTANEOUSLY

HELEN FORKS REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT EVERY MONTH IN ENGLAND AND WALES AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN WOMEN AND TWO MEN ARE KILLED BY THEIR CURRENT OR FORMER PARTNER IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS TRIED TO TACKLE WITH A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES FOCUSING ON THE ARREST PROSECUTION AND IMPRISONMENT OF OFFENDERS
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE IS NOW TO BE A DIFFERENT FOCUS ON THE MOST DANGEROUS PERPETRATORS THOSE THOUGHT CAPABLE OF SERIOUS HARM OR EVEN MURDER IN A PILOT PROJECT IN TWO PARTS OF ENGLAND AND IN SOUTH WALES THEY WILL BE GIVEN ONE TO ONE HELP WITH ALCOHOL DRUGS AND MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS ADVICE ON EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND PARENTING WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE SCHEME IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST THE EXPERIENCE OF RACHEL WILLIAMS WHOSE HUSBAND DARREN SUBJECTED HER TO YEARS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE
BEFORE SHOOTING HER AND KILLING HIMSELF YOU MAY FIND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR DISTURBING
THE FIERCEST VIVID MOMENT IN MY RELATIONSHIP WAS WHEN I WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT AND WE HAD A ROW AND THAT RESULTED IN DARREN LIFTING ME OFF THE FLOOR BY MY THROAT AND HE LET ME GO WHEN I TURN BLUE AND THAT WAS HIS WIT AND DARREN COULD DO THAT COS HE WAS SIX FOOT SEVEN AND TWENTY TWO STONE HE WAS A BODY BUILDER SO THAT'S THE THE FACE REAL VIVID MOMENT OF ABUSE FOR ME
AND DID IT DID IT CARRY ON ON A ON A REGULAR BASIS YEAH IT WAS QUITE RARE CLAIRE BUT WHEN YOU'RE A VICTIM YOU ARE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS BECAUSE ONE MINUTE THEY'RE NICE AND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY HURRIED AND YOU JUST YOU JUST WAITING FOR THE UNEXPECTED ALL THE TIME HOW LONG WERE YOU MARRIED WE WERE TOGETHER EIGHTEEN YEARS AND HOW DID THINGS COME TO A HEAD
HE'D STRANGLED ME ON THE MORNING OF JULY THE NINTH AND HE STRANGLED ME SO FEROCIOUSLY THAT THE NOISE THAT I MADE WILL BOTH MY SONS AND THEY BOTH RUN DOWNSTAIRS WHEN DENNIS I LOOK MY NINE ANKLE AND THE OTHER ONE HAD A BASEBALL BAT AND THAT'S WHEN I REALISED THAT THE FEEL OF STEAM WITH DOWN BECAME GREATER THAN THE FEAR OF LEAVING NAME SO THAT WAS WHEN I DECIDED I HAD TO DO SOMETHING SO YOU DID LEAVE HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
SO THAT THEY WERE SIX WEEKS SORT OF PROCESS AFTER I'D LEFT IN MY FILE FOR DIVORCE AND REALLY WAS GONE FULL STEAM AHEAD ENGAGED WITH ALL THE SERVICES TO SORT OF GET A CONVICTION FOR DARREN AND ON THE MORNING OF THE NINETEENTH OF AUGUST DOWN CAME TO MY PLACE OF WORK AND WITH A SAWN OFF SHOTGUN AND SHOT ME HE SHOT YOU IN YOUR PLACE OF WORK
YEAH I JUST ACTUALLY LITERALLY FINISHED ON A LADY'S HAIR AND I GAVE THE LADY HER CHANGE BACK AND SHE SAID TO ME ALWAYS IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT COS THEY SORT OF KNEW HIM WITH WHAT WAS SORT OF GOING ON I LOOKED AT THE DOOR BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING OBSCURE THE LIGHT COS IT IS A REAL SUNNY DAY AND FILL IN THE DOORFRAME WAS DARREN WALKING THROUGH THERE THE DOOR POLLINATOR HAVE AGAIN EIGHT OF HIS BAG AND WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GET HIT
IN MY AIM FOR MY CHEST AFTER MY VAN TOWARDS IT AND TRIED TO GET TO GOING OFF HIM AND HE HIT ME WITH THE BETTER THE GIRTON AND I FELL ON THE FLOOR AND I TRIED TO PULL THE RECEPTION DESK OVER MY LEGS WHICH WAS KICKED AWAY BY HIM
AND I HAD PRESENCE OF MIND TO PULL MY LEGS AND PUT MY KNEES RIGHT UNDERNEATH MY CHIN AS HE FIRED IT IT HIT MY LEFT LEG AND THE HE FIRED AGAIN AND THANKFULLY THAT MACE JUST SORT OF WENT PAST MY MANY PUT AGAIN DEIGNED TO RELOAD WHEN I GRABBED THE GUN AND MAD A SUPERNATURAL STRENGTH AND WE WERE FIGHTING FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN COS HE COULDN'T GET THE GOING OFF ME HE THEN PROCEEDED TO KICK ME AND STAMP AND PINCH ALL OVER
SUPERNATURAL STRENGTH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU MUST HAVE NEEDED BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS A VERY BIG MAN YEAH HE WAS HUGE I MEAN MY FRAME OF BEINN FIFA EIGHT AND JUST OVER TEN AND A HALF STONE
I WASN'T MUCH OF A MATCH FOR HIM I MEAN NO MAN WAS A MATCH FOR HIM IN A LONG MYSELF BUT I THINK WHEN YOU'RE FACING DEATH I THINK IT HIT SOMETHING TAKES OVER YOU WHEN YOU YOU SORT OF GIVE THE URAL WATTAGE
YOU FIND OUT AFTER YOU WENT TO HOSPITAL WHAT HAPPENED TO DARREN IT WAS SOME OF THE SCRUFFY WHERE WAS LATER THERE WAS A MANHUNT FOR HIM COS OBVIOUSLY WAS ARMED AND DANGEROUS AND I CAN JUST REMEMBER THEM BEING TOLD US LATER ON IN THE EVENING THAT BAKED BEING FAME DEAD BUT I ALREADY KNEW THAT ANYWAY COS DOWN WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO PRISON SO I KNEW HE WOULD HAVE HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE SO THAT WAS JUST I WAS JUST WAITING FOR IT TO BE CONFIRMED YOU'RE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT TODAY
IN AN INCREDIBLY MATTER OF FACT WAY BUT WHAT WAS THE IMPACT ON YOU AND YOUR SONS
WELL TRAGICALLY I SPENT SIX WEEKS IN HOSPITAL DON'T SWANSEA MORRISON AND DURING THAT TIME JACK SORT OF BECAME ESTRANGED FROM THEIR FAMILY
COS HE WENT TO HIS DAD'S FAMILY FOR SYMPATHY FOR HIS DEATH WHICH OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T GET FOR MY FAMILY AND I THINK IT JUST SORT OF MESSED WITH HIS HEAD SO MUCH THAT HE JUST COULDN'T COPE AND HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
YOUR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD TOOK HIS OWN LIFE YEAH SO HE'S A VICTIM AS WELL OF DOMESTIC ABUSE
WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE SCHEME THAT IS BEING PLANNED NOW THAT IS GOING TO TARGET EITHER THOSE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AT RISK OF SERIOUS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALL HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED SOME DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AND HELP THEM WITH WITH ONE TO ONE SESSIONS IN EVERYTHING FROM HOUSING TO MENTAL HEALTH TO PARENTING
WOULD IT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN A CASE LIKE YOURS I THINK IT DOWN PROBABLY WOULD'VE ENGAGE WITH IT FOR A WHILE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG FOR I MEAN HINDSIGHT IS WONDERFUL IN IT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AT LEAST HE COULD HAVE BEEN RISK ASSESSED AND
IT'S ALL THE AGENCIES IN THE SERVICES WOULD IT WHO WHO ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED WITH THIS PILOT SCHEME WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED SO I WOULD HAVE KNOWN I WAS BEING FULLY SUPPORTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND PUT ALL THE MEASURES IN PLACE SO IF DARREN HAD HIS MINDSET HADN'T BEEN CHANGED THROUGH THE PILOT SCHEME THEN CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN RISK ASSESSED AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE RADAR WERE THERE TIMES WHEN WHEN YOU WISH THAT THERE WAS
SOME SORT OF PROFESSIONAL HELP FOR HIM AT LEAST DEFINITELY I MEAN I REMEMBER ONE TIME PHONE IN MIND AND ASK YOU NEED TO SOME SORT OF COUNSELLING BECAUSE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A VIOLENT HOUSEHOLD HIMSELF MANY TOLD ME THERE WAS A VERY LONG WAITING LIST AND I COULD PUT HIS NAME DOWN ON THE WAITING LIST BUT THERE WAS A SUPPORT WORKER FOR ME AND MY RESPONSE WAS I NOT THE BUM OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES I DON'T NEED SUPPORT
THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS WE COULD SAY THAT ONCE ONCE SOMEONE IS IN THE CASE WHERE SOMEONE IS KNOWN TO HAVE CARRIED OUT THESE SORTS OF ACTS THEN THEN THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR IT AND THAT SHOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YEAH BUT THE OWNERSHIP SHOULD BE PUT PIPPA TRAITOR THEY ARE THE PROBLEM WHY IS IT ALWAYS THE WOMAN THAT'S GOT A LEAVE THEIR HOME AND THEIR FAMILY HOME AND TAKE THE KIDS AND BROUGHT HIM UP COUNTRY WHEREVER THEY GOT A GIRL AND THE KIDS COATING YOUR SCORES IT'S NOT FEAR THE YON GILL NETS SHOULD BE ON THE PIER THE TRAITOR AND HOW ARE YOU NOW
I'M FINE I'VE GOT I GOT A RIDE IN MY LEG AND YOU KNOW IT BE STICKS ME INCIDENT THINGS BET YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M NO LONGER A VICTIM I'M THICK DOOR I'VE WHEN THE VICTORY I'M STILL STAND IN I WANT TO BE THE VOICE FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT STILL STANDIN AND WHILE I'VE GOT BREATH IN MY LUNGS ARE GOING TO KEEP ON CAMPAIGN INTO TO SEE CHANGE WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
RACHEL WILLIAMS WILL BE INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT OFFER SUPPORT TO PERPETRATORS THIS CALL DRIVE ONE OF THE CHARITY'S BACKING IT IS SAFE LIVES ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIED A BARON IS WITH US AND WE'RE DRAWN FROM BATH BY MIKE BEDFORD FROM SPLITS AN INDEPENDENT CHARITY AND LEADING PROVIDER OF DOMESTIC ABUSE SUPPORT SERVICES IN SOUTH WEST ENGLAND GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING DINA BARON HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT IDENTIFYING THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE SCHEME
SO THEY WILL BE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE THEIR PARTNERS WILL HAVE BEEN
RISK ASSESSED AND SEEN AS THE HIGHEST RISK AND MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS IN THEIR PARTICULAR AREA SO ONCE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE WOMAN WHO IS MOST AT RISK THEN THEIR PARTNERS WILL BE REFERRED TO THE DRIVE PROGRAMME HOWEVER SERIOUS THEIR ACT WAS I'M WONDERING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A CASE LIKE RACHEL WILLIAMS WHERE WHEN SHE WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT HER HUSBAND
TRIED TO STRANGLE HOW DID STRANGLE HER JUST NOT DEATH WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE HE WOULD'VE BEEN ELIGIBLE SO HOW'D SERIOUS DOES IT HAVE TO GET BEFORE IT IS SOLELY A POLICE CASE
I THINK SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS CASES ACTUALLY NEVER COME TO THE SITE OF THE POLICE SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RISK AND DOMESTIC ABUSE OFTEN THAT CAN TAKE THE FORM OF EXTREME LEVELS OF CONTROL AS WELL AS EXTREME LEVELS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ABUSE AND AS RACHEL SAID
THIS IS OFTEN INTERMITTENT SO THIS PROJECT WILL BE DRIVEN BY SAFEGUARDING VICTIMS AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING NEITHER AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE NOR ARE THEY BEING HELD TO ACCOUNT AND THE POINT OF DRIVE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BASS THERE'S BOTH THE CARROT
AND A STICK AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE NEED TO GET THEM THERE AND GET THEM THEY'RE SOLIDLY SO AT THE POINT THAT YOU'RE CONDUCTING THESE THESE ONE TO ONE SESSIONS HE'S VERY BIG THIS VERY INTENSIVE PROCESS WITH WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT ALREADY BE BE PERPETRATORS EVEN OF SERIOUS VIOLENCE
YOU ARE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THEY MAY END UP BEING PROSECUTED YOU DO YOU KEEP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ABREAST BREAST WHAT'S GOING COMPLETELY SO THE ROLE OF THE DRIVE CASE MANAGER IS REALLY A COORDINATING LAND BETWEEN THOSE AGENCIES WHO IN THE JARGON CAN DISRUPT SOMEBODY'S BEHAVIOUR WHICH WOULD BE POLICE OR PROBATION OR
YOUTH SERVICES AND THOSE WHO CAN DIVERT SO THOSE WHO CAN HELP
SUPPORT SOMEBODY TO CHANGE BUT IT IS THAT COMBINATION THAT WE HOPE WILL HOLD PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT AND EITHER CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR OR MANAGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR MIGHT BEDFORD WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE SCHEME I THINK'S VERY POSITIVE SCHEME TO ENGAGE WITH THEM
THE MOST PERSISTENT AND HIGH RISK OFFENDERS WHICH IS GENERALLY WHAT WE DON'T DO WE DEAL WITH MEN WHO COME TO US BECAUSE I'VE IDENTIFIED THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE MUCH MORE EASIER TO ENABLE CHANGE WITHIN
BECAUSE I'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PART OF A COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSE FOR A BIT BUT THAT WOULD BE WHAT WOULD THAT BE THE MAJORITY OF OF PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE'S THIS SCHEME WOULD TARGET THE MINORITY WHO WHO ARE THE MORE EXTREME
I THINK IT WOULD BE A MINORITY BUT IT'S STILL A VERY HIGH NUMBER IF I LOOK AT WILTSHIRE AND THE NUMBER OF REOFFENDING CASES ATTEND THE MULTI AGENCY RISK ASSESSMENT CONFERENCE THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER WE COULD ENGAGE WITH
BY DOING THE DRIVE PROCESS WITHIN WILTSHIRE SO WHERE IT'S BEING TRIALLED I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS AND HOPE WE CAN
FACILITATE CHANGE IN THE HIGH RISK OFFENDERS IN DUE COURSE BUT DINA BARONETS IT'S A THREE YEAR PILOT PROJECTS THAT WILL BEGIN HOW WILL YOU GAUGE WHETHER YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES FOR THE NUMBERS OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO DIE EVERY MONTH IN ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S PRETTY SHOCKING
ABSOLUTELY IS SHOCKING AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS LIKE SOPH LIVES AND SPLITS AND COUNTLESS WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS ROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS TRYING TO TURN THIS ROUND SO WE REALLY
YOU KNOW ARE CONVINCED AND YOU HAD RACHEL PUT IT MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN ANY OF US CAN THAT UNLESS WE DEAL WITH THE PERPETRATOR WERE NEVER GOING TO CUT THOSE NUMBERS BACK IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE WERE HAVING AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION DONE BY PROFESSOR MARIANNE HESTER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL SO THERE'LL BE A PROPER ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE
OUR CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS WILL BE THE SAFETY OF VICTIMS AND CHILDREN AND THE REPEAT OFFENDING OF THE GUYS WHEN WORKING WITH MIKE BEDFORD WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS YOU KNOW WORKING AS AS YOU DO WITH THE LESS EXTREME CASES THAT THAT IF SOMEONE IS OFFERED THIS SCHEME OR OR PUT ON THIS SCHEME THAT IT IN SOME WAY THEY THEY ARE BEING LABELLED AS A AS A HIGH RISK PERSON
NO WE WE WE NEED TO WORK WITH THESE MEN WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE CAUSE NOT THE EFFECT AND AS RACHEL DID PUTTING IF WE JUST KEEP MOVING WOMEN AWAY FROM THE SITUATION WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THE CAUSE AND THAT MAN MAY GO ON TO MURDER IN FUTURE SO LET'S DEAL WITH THESE PERSISTENT HIGH RISK OFFENDERS SO YOU ARE INTERVENING TO SUPPORT THE MEN IT'S JUST THAT THIS PARTICULAR SCHEME IS IS ONE TO ONE WHEREAS HOW DO YOU OPERATE IN GROUPS YEAH WE RUN A TWENTY FIVE WE GROUP WORK PROGRAMME
FOLLOWED BY TWELVE MONTHS ON THE RELAPSE PREVENTION GROUP TO ENABLE MEANT TO MAINTAIN AND SUSTAIN THE CHANGES THEY HAVE LEARNT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF A GROUP
AND IS IT THAT ONGOING SUPPORT THAT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF YOU COULD SAY WANT ONE THING THAT DOES WORK IN IN CHANGING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE HAVING THE READ OUTS PREVENTION GROUP IS THE KEY FOR US BECAUSE MEN CAN POP IN AND POP OUT AND SAY YES I HAD A BIT OF A THOUGHT AND I NEED TO DO SOMETHING SO WE CAN GET THEM STRAIGHT IN AND HAVE A CHAT AND GET THEM
INTO THE NEXT RELAPSE PREVENTION GROUP IS A FAIL SAFE POSITION FOR THE MAN BECAUSE I DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR FACILITATORS LIKE BEDFORD FROM THE CHARITY SPLITS AND DINA BARON FROM SAY FLOOD THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
BUT I WAS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT IS A BIG YEAR FOR GOLF THE SPORT IS BACK IN THE OLYMPICS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND RIO IN AUGUST WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MINNESOTA IN SEPTEMBER IN THE RYDER CUP AND YET SINCE A BOOM IN THE NINETIES GOLF'S BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A DROP IN THE NUMBERS PLAYING AND COURSES CLOSING THE REASONS PERHAPS THE TIME IT TAKES TO PLAY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT AND PERCEPTION THAT IT IS AN ELITIST GAME
ROB ON IT'S BEEN TO A PUBLIC COURSE IN SOUTH LONDON THAT'S THREATENED WITH CLOSURE AND THERE'S CAMPAIGNING TO KEEP IT OPEN WILL LEARN TODAY WHETHER THEIR FEARS ARE TO BE CONFIRMED
THEY CAN REPLACE PARK GOLF COURSES AND BY LEWISHAM COUNCIL WHOSE MEN MUST MAKE A BIG DECISION THIS EVENING DOES HE ORDERED THE CLOSURE OF A SPORTS FACILITY OPEN TO I A LOT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES PLAYED GOLF AT THE SQUAT IS ACCESSED ACROSS THIS QUITE ELITIST FORBIDDEN OTHER COURSES HOW MUCH LEWISHAM ADVERTISING THE GOLF COURSE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF IT WHEN I FIRST CAME UP HERE
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLY BISSY IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE CAME IN IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY SUPERB
AT THIS POINT I SHOULD DECLARE AN INTEREST AT BECKENHAM PLACE PARTS WHERE I ONCE LEARNED TO PLAY BADLY LOUDLY NO DOUBT GENERALLY MAKING A NUISANCE OF MYSELF OTHERS LEARNT THERE IS ADULTS HIS FORMER ARSENAL AND ENGLAND FOOTBALLER IAN WRIGHT
I STARTED PLAYING GOLF IN TWO THOUSAND AND OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE ROCKING UP AT THESE REALLY PLUSH GOLF COURSES NOT NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS DOING SO I USED TO GO TO TO BECKENHAM WE WILL MAKE TONY AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I STARTED MY FIRST FEW ROUNDS OF GOLFERS ARE AT THEY CAN IMPOSE FAR AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ABOUT ROB IS THAT I THINK IT'D BE A SHAME IF IT WASN'T
LEWISHAM'S PLANS INCLUDE THE FLOODING OF SOME FAIRWAYS WITH AN ARTIFICIAL LAKE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF OTHER LEISURE FACILITIES ACROSS THE COURSE THEY'RE APPLYING TO THE HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND FOR ABOUT FIVE MILLION POUNDS TO DO THE WORK THE MONEY WON'T BE AVAILABLE THEY SAY IF THE GOLF COURSE IS RETAINED THEY ALSO SAY THEY'VE CONSULTED THE PUBLIC AT THE COURT IN ANY CASE HE'S LOSING MONEY CAROL HOPE A NON GOLFER SPEAKS FOR THE CAMPAIGN
I AM TOLD BY LEWISHAM COUNCIL THAT THEY SPOKE TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE OR ORGANISATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE GOLF COURSE OF WHICH ONLY SIXTY TWO PEOPLE SUPPORT THE SCHEME THAT LEWISHAM HAVE GONE WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A PAPER PETITION AGAINST CLOSURE OF THE GOLF COURSE
I'M JENNY KAY AND I'M PLAY WITH BRACE I'D LADIES' GOLF CLUB MANY OF US PLAYED A FIRST EVER GAME OF GOLF HERE AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE A THRIVING GOLF CLUB IF ONLY IT WAS PROPERLY MARKETED WE ALL PAY CASH TO PLAY GOLF
WE ASKED THE QUESTION WHERE IS THAT CASH GONE COS IT HASN'T GONE INTO INVESTING IN THE GOLF COURSE THIS COULD BECOME A THRIVING IN A LONDON GOLF COURSE
LEWISHAM FELT UNABLE TO PROVIDE A SPOKESPERSON IN RESPONSE BUT SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT THE LOTTERY FUND INVESTMENT CAN I QUOTE ATTRACT NEW VISITORS TO NEW ATTRACTION
CITING ALSO PRIORITIES WITH GOVERNMENT CUTS TO OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH AS SOCIAL CARE AND STREET SWEEPING AND THEY EITHER THEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO QUOTE ARREST THE NATIONAL TREND OF DECLINING USAGE OF GOLF COURSES
NOW LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PUBLIC COURSES IN ENGLAND LET'S HOPE THIS IS NOT A TREND THAT GETS TOO STRONG MARTIN SLUMBERS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ROYAL AND ANCIENT GOLF CLUB I THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR SOME OF THOSE COUNCILS IN TERMS OF MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
THE MORE PEOPLE PLAYING THE MORE THE ECONOMICS WILL IMPROVE FOR THOSE COURSES THERE'S SOME VERY INTERESTING RESEARCH GOING AROUND A BROADER VIEW OR PARTICIPATION INCLUDING PAR THREE COURSES DRIVING RANGES NINE HOLE GOLF COURSE AS WELL AS THE TRADITIONAL EIGHTEEN
MEANWHILE GOLF ENGLAND HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF MARKETING FORUMS FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COURSE MANAGERS IN ORDER TO BUILD ON THOSE INNOVATIONS BUT COUNSEL AND COURSES REMAIN VULNERABLE THEY'VE HE MCLEAN A BATCH WHAT WHOLE CLUB WHOSE COURSE IS OWNED BY SAINT ALBAN'S COUNSEL WE WILL ALWAYS BE UNDER THREAT BECAUSE ESPECIALLY
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION THAT WILL KNOW ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BUILD A GREEN LAND SITE THERE ARE MANY OTHER CLUBS OF LOOKED UP TO THIS AND IT'S BEEN VERY LUCRATIVE TO PERHAPS SELL YOUR CALL GOLF COURSE AND THEN MOVE ON TO ANOTHER SAY ELSEWHERE I DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S NOT LIGHTWEIGHTS WHO HAPPEN TO US BUT IN A PLACE LIKE SAINT ALBAN SPHERE LAND IS AT AN ABSOLUTE PREMIUM IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE WOULDN'T LOOK OUT IN THE FUTURE
WE'RE GOING TO PLACE PARKER'S HAD A GOLF COURSE SINCE NINETEEN OH SEVEN AND IN ITS HEYDAY WAS DESCRIBED AS THE BUSIEST IN EUROPE BUT IF THE MAYOR AGREES THIS EVENING IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY CLOTHES IN DECEMBER
WHERE A COHESIVE COMMUNITY WHERE A SOCIAL GROUP AS WELL AS A SPORTING GROUP IT WOULD JUST BE TERRIBLY SAD IF WE CAN'T CONTINUE THAT TRADITION
WE'LL BE BEREFT BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE IT BUT WE NEED IT TO SURVIVE THIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY IN THEIR LONDON GOLF COURSES WHEN THIS IS GONE WHAT DO WE HAVE LEFT
ROB BONNET REPORTING IN A REMARKABLY HE'S HOT FOOTED IT FROM THE GOLF COURSE STRAIGHT INTO THE STUDIO YES FROM BECKENHAM TO HERE IS ABOUT WHAT TWELVE MILES IT'S AMAZING ISN'T IT REALLY ISN'T SCIENCE WONDERFUL PARIS TO CHELSEA ONE REPRESENTS SOMETHING OF A QUALIFIED SUCCESS FOR THE LONDON SIDE FROM A TRICKY LOOKING CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FIXTURE THEY HAVE AN AWAY GOAL SCORED BY THE KELP

THE COUNTRY A FORMIDABLE FORCE OF COURSE IN THE SPORT'S MIDDLE AND LONG DISTANCE OF ENSIGN FOLLOWING A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION LAST WEEK IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE ABOUT DOPING AMONGST ITS COMPETITORS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ATHLETICS KENYA ISAAC KNOW LANKY HAS NOW BEEN ACCUSED OF ASKING ATHLETES FOR BRIBES TO REDUCE THE DOPING BANDS HE STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS POST TEMPORARILY HE SAYS AND DENIES THE ALLEGATION AND AS A SPORTS CORRESPONDENT RICHARD CONWAY HE'S BEEN TELLING ME HE'S BEEN DESCRIBING HIS CURRENT DISTRESSED
WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE CAUSED HIM A LOT OF MENTAL ANGUISH NO THAT WAS IN THE LETTER TO THE ATHLETICS GOVERNING BODY IN KENYA HE SAYS HE'S ANXIOUS TO CLEAR HIS NAME HE DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HER BUT OF COURSE THIS COMES AFTER THREE OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE SUSPENDED LAST YEAR THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO BUY THE IDLE F. WHILE INVESTIGATION TOOK PLACE IN THE ALLEGATIONS OF WHAT
SUBVERSION OF THE ANTI DOPING PROCESS IN KENYA WHAT HAPPENED THE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM ONE OF THE SPONSORS NIKE HOW SERIOUS IS THIS ISSUE FOR ATHLETICS IT SOUNDS PRETTY GREY
THEY'VE MISSED A DEADLINE SET BY THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY WILD OR TWO TO GET THEMSELVES INTO SHAPE AND TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THINGS THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY BEEN PUT ON PROBATION
BY GOD AND NOW THEY HAVE TO ANSWER SOME BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR PROCESSES WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND OF COURSE THAT ALL FOLLOWS STRING OF POSITIVE DO DRUGS TESTS IN A CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS SO THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES LIKELY THEY COULD BE FACING SUSPENSION
THEY COULD EVEN MISSED THE OLYMPICS LIKE RUSSIA IS FACING AS WELL BECAUSE IT ALL SOME FORTY KENYANS HAVE FAILED DRUGS TESTS IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER THEN ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR TRACK AND FIELD IN RIO IF NEITHER KENYA NOR RUSSIA ACTUALLY APPEAR
THEY ARE OF COURSE AREN'T THEY WERE UP THERE TO THE BIGGEST NATIONS IN TRACK AND FIELD IN ATHLETICS OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT KEN YOU WHO WOULD SEVEN GOLDS AT THE LAST WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS RUSSIA WHO EIGHT OLYMPIC TRACK AND FIELD GOALS IT AT LONDON TWENTY TWELVE LOCALS WE NOW KNOW THAT MANY ATHLETES HAVE BEEN TAINTED BY BY DOPING ACCORDING TO THOSE IN IF THERE'S COMMISSION REPORTS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THIS YEAR AND IN THE LATTER PART OF LAST YEAR
IT ALL WE IN TERMS OF RUSSIA RUSSIAN KEN YOU'RE MISSING OUT I THINK THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON THIS YOU ARE KEN YOU WILL BE DESPERATE TO TRY AND PROVE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THINGS ORGANISED THIS GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT AS WELL THE BIG QUESTION THE REMAINS OVER RUSSIA IN MANY PEOPLE SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD PERHAPS MISS OUT ON THIS UPCOMING OLYMPICS GIVEN THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'VE HAD AT THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THEM BUT YOU CAN'T THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU

BRITISH OFFICIALS ARE MAKING A FINAL PUSH TO FRAME A DRAFT DEAL ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID CAMERON IS HOPING TO SECURE BACKING FOR HIS PROPOSED CHANGES AT A SUMMIT WHICH STARTS IN BRUSSELS TOMORROW A REFERENDUM COULD BE HELD IN THE U.K. AS EARLY AS JUNE

INSPECTORS HAVE RELEASED A HIGHLY CRITICAL REPORT ABOUT CONDITIONS IN LEICESTER PRISON THEY SAID THAT DURING A VISIT IN OCTOBER A NUMBER OF INMATES COULDN'T BE FINED
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE UNITED NATIONS IS HOPING TO GET AID TO SEVEN TOWNS IN SYRIA FROM TODAY ONE OF THEM THE DIARIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STARVING TO DEATH ANOTHER KATH ABOUT NOW THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO IN TWO YEARS AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'LL FIND A THIRD DARE OURS CAN ONLY BE REACHED WITH AIR DROPS BECAUSE IT'S BESIEGED BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR ACCESS COMES THEIR HOPES FOR A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BY THE END OF THE WEEK
SOMEONE WHO HAS SOME SENSE OF WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE IN SYRIA IS THE WAR REPORTER JANINE DI GIOVANNI WHO'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK THE MORNING THEY CAME FOR US DISPATCHES FROM SYRIAN SHE'S HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE OF OF WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN BECAUSE THESE ARE JUST SEVEN TOWNS BUT PRESUMABLY THIS IS REPLICATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY LIFE IS TERRIFIC
THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR OF WAR AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THAT MEANS HER FOR FIVE YEARS PEOPLE'S LIVES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DISRUPTED CHILDREN DON'T GO TO SCHOOL NO ELECTRICITY NO HEATING IN MANY PLACES FOOD DISRUPTION JUST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE FROZEN IN THE SIEGE OF SORRY EVER WENT ON FOR THREE YEARS AND IT WAS THE WORST THING I THOUGHT I'D EVER SEEN THIS IS FAR WORSE AND I THINK THE MAIN THING WE HAVE TO THINK OF HIS SINCE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THE RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES BEGAN
IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE FADERS AND END CIVILIANS TELL ME THAT THEY NOW FEAR THE RUSSIAN PLANES MUCH MORE THAN THEY EVER FEARED ASAD THE REGIME PLANES OR THE BOMBING OR THE FADING
I THINK THAT IT'S ESCALADE IT NOT ONLY THE REFUGEE CRISIS WHICH IS HORRIFIC IN EUROPE AS WE NOW MAKING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE HAVING TO FLEE THEIR HOMES LEAVE BEHIND EVERYTHING THEY KNOW BUT ALSO IT IT'S NOW BROKER LIKE A LARGER WIDER WAR THAT COULD HAPPEN
BETWEEN RUSSIA TURKEY THEY'VE JUST COMPLETELY UPPED THE ANTE WITH THEIR RUTHLESSNESS AND YET WE ALSO HAVE THIS POSSIBILITY OF A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES WITHIN DAYS WHATEVER WHATEVER THAT MEANS YES I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IT I WON'T I DON'T WANT TO BE CYNICAL EVEN THOUGH THIS IS THE MOST CYNICAL WAR I HAVE EVER REPORTED IT I HAVE NEVER SEEN PARTY USE THERE ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN PEOPLE
FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAINS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND IT HAS BECOME A PROXY WAR THAT IS SO WIDESPREAD AND SO DETERMINED THAT IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY SAPPED ANY KIND OF DIPLOMATIC PATHWAY OR COULD BE MADE OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES
FOR ME A CEASEFIRE ALWAYS MEANS TIME FOR FADERS TO REGROUP AND TO REASSESS THEIR STRATEGY AND THIS IS CERTAINLY WHAT THE RUSSIANS AND ASAD ARE DOING WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THEY'RE WINNING THEIR WINNING WHY WOULD THEY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GIVE BACK ANY TERRITORY PUTIN IS IN CONTROL NOW BUT IS THERE ANOTHER AT LEAST HOPE FOR THE END OF THIS THAT ACTUALLY
PRESENT THE SAD WHENCE I THINK IT WILL INCREASINGLY LOOKS NOW AS THOUGH HE HAS ONE AND THIS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE WESTERN INACTION WHICH WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN VARIOUS WARS THAT HAVE TO BOSNIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT I THINK THAT AT THIS POINT ASAD HAS WITH THE BACKING OF ARANA AND RUSSIA AND SINCE THE RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES
HAS STRATEGICALLY TAKEN MORE CONTROL AND ALSO THE RISE OF RADICALISM HAS MADE PEOPLE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION TURN BACK AND WANT US SUPPORT ASAD BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT DAISHA ISIS
IN DAMASCUS SO THEY PREFER TO HAVE ASAD THE DEVIL THEY KNOW REMAIN IN PLACE THEN TO HAVE AND RADICALISM AND IS THAT THE SORT OF MESSAGE THAT YOU PICKED UP JUST FROM THE PEOPLE WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING THAT YOU SPOKE TO WHEN YOU WERE THERE WELL WHAT I TRY TO DO IS TO TRY TO TELL THE WAR THROUGH THE STORIES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE AND TO LET THEM TELL IT AND TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM FROM THE BEGINNING HOW THEY TRIED TO RISE UP SOME OF THEM IN A PEACEFUL UPRISING HOW IT BECAME VIOLENT AND NOW HOWARD A SPIRAL
SO THAT IS NO LONGER ABOUT SYRIA REALLY IT'S ABOUT A MUCH WIDER PICTURE IT'S ABOUT RUSSIA TRYING TO REGAIN THEIR FOOTBALL AND THEIR TYRANNY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IT'S ABOUT PUTIN'S RUTHLESSNESS IT'S ABOUT THE WEST'S IN IN ACTION
IT'S ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WHOM I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR PUTTING THIS ON HOLD FOR SO LONG THAT WE ALLOWED DAISH ISIS TO RISE UP AND BECOME A FORCE THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T THINK WILL BE ABLE TO CONQUER AND IT'S ABOUT THE RISE OF RADICAL EXTREMISM
THE REFUGEE CRISIS IN EUROPE SO NONE OF THIS COMES WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES IT'S ALL CONNECTED
WE WEIGHED IT FOR SO LONG WHEN I STARTED COVERING THIS WAR AND RAIDING THIS BOOK IF I COULD SEE ISIS COMING WHY DIDN'T BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE WHY DIDN'T THEY DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT WHAT HAS NOW BECOME
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE ANOTHER MAJOR WAR THIS IS BIG THIS IS RUSSIA THIS IS TURKEY DIS IS SAUDI CATARRH IRAN AND WE JUST LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN
JANINE DID GIOVANNI THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME HE'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE THE POLICE NEED TO RE FORMULATE THEIR APPROACH TO AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ABUSE SO THAT THE COMPLAINANT IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVED THAT'S WHAT THE COMMISSION OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE SAYS SHOULD HAPPEN AFTER CRITICISM OF POLICE HANDLING OF HIGH PROFILE CASES COULD THAT TAKE US BACK TO AN EARLIER ERA WHERE WOMEN WERE OFTEN DISMISSED OR NOT BELIEVED WHEN THEY WENT TO THE POLICE
AS SEEN IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO B.B.C. DOCUMENTARY A COMPLAINT OF RAPE BY THE FILM MAKER AND CRIMINOLOGIST ROGER GRIEF WAS HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOUR DOCUMENTARY WAS INCREDIBLY INFLUENTIAL IT CHANGE THE WAY THE POLICE HANDLED THESE SORTS OF CASES WHERE THEY CHANGE THE WAY A LOT OF POLICE HANDLE RAPE AND THEY STILL SHOW IT IN TRAINING AS HOW NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY DON'T BELIEVE THE WOMAN WHO BRINGS THE COMPLAINT BUT WE STILL HAVE THE SITUATION IN WHICH ONE IN FOUR
ALLEGATIONS OF SEX SEXUAL VIOLENCE I'M NOT RECORDED BY THE POLICE AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRIGGER FROM LEAVING THE VICTIM CAME IT WAS IN A REPORT BY THE AGE OF MY SEA SAYING THAT THAT'S A BIT A LOT OF CRIME IS UNDER REPORT ONE IN FIVE CRIMES ARE UNDER RECORDED AND ONE IN FOR SEXUAL ONES BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT ALSO SAID THEY WERE RESPECTED
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE POLICE TO TREAT ALL EVIDENCE NEUTRALLY HAS
AS EVIDENCE AND TO TEST IT BUT THEY NEED TO DO IT WITH RESPECT COS THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING DOES THAT MEAN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WHETHER THE POLICE BELIEVE THE VICTIM BECAUSE BELIEF IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT WORD NOW AS IT WAS WHEN YOU LOOKED INTO INTO ALL OF THIS
WHERE SHOULD BELIEF COME INTO THE PROCESS WELL IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE CASES LIKE THE YORKSHIRE RIPPER WHO WAS IN POLICE HANDS NINE TIMES BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT BY ACCIDENT BY A P.C. AND A TRAFFIC STOP THAT THE NOTION OF BELIEF GUIDES PEOPLE'S HANDLING OF EVIDENCE BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THEY NEED TO BE AS EXECUTIVE AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND TO TAKE THIS A LITTLE FURTHER I FEEL ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ABOUT THE WHOLE HISTORIC SEX ABUSE CASES IS THAT IT'S SO HARD TO TEST THOSE BELIEFS NOW AGAINST
THE LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT COMES WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME AND I THOUGHT I WORRY THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TO COMPLETELY BUFFALOED BY THE REACTION TO THE JIMMY SAVILE CASE AND THAT'S WHY THEY'VE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH VERY PRECIOUS AND REDUCING POLICE RESOURCES ON THIS BUSINESS THAN THE BELIEF ISSUE AUNTS IRISH ARE COMING BACK TO THEIR RELIEF ISSUE IS WHAT FAMOUSLY
THE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT SAID THAT NICK IN THE FAMOUS OPERATION MIDDLING CASE WAS CREDIBLE AND DREW WILL HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS BELIEF THAT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY
WHEN SOMEBODY WAS IN CHARGE OF HER CASE SAYS I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED AND THAT HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE WHAT DO YOU THINK SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS HAS IT RIGHT NOW WHEN HE SAYS THAT POLICE SHOULD SHOW EMPATHY TOWARDS VICTIMS BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND SO NO AUTOMATIC BELIEF I DO THINK THAT BUT THEY HAVE TO ALSO DO IT WITH RESPECT AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S BEEN MISSING A LONG YOU KNOW I HAVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RAPES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING EVERY YEAR OF WHICH ONLY FIFTEEN PER CENT ARE REPORTED AT ALL
AND FIVE PERCENT OF THE CASES THAT ARE REPORTED GET CONVICTIONS IN COURT OF THE PROSECUTION SAID THAT HAPPEN AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE WHOLE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS AGAINST THE VICTIM RE VICTIMISED AS THEM IN COURT AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS IT'S STILL TINY AND THERE'S A LEAVEN RAPES AN HOUR ACCORDING TO THESE DICK THINK ABOUT THAT AND SO LITTLE OF THAT IS GETTING DEALT WITH PROPERLY UNTIL IT'S IN IT IS A KIND OF EMERGENCY BUT WE CAN'T DO IT BY JUST SAYING
ALL THE VICTIMS ARE RIGHT ALL THE VICTIMS ARE WRONG IT'S NONSENSE BUT CAMPAIGNERS MIGHT SAY THAT THIS RE FORMULATION IS SORT OF MOVING AWAY FROM AUTOMATIC BELIEVE COULD MAKE EXACTLY THAT PICTURE YOU'RE PAINTING EVEN WORSE BUT IT COULD PUT ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS DOING THIS WORK I SAW IT HENDON POLICE COLLEGE A WOMAN CLEANING ANOTHER WOMAN RATHER ROUGHLY AS AN INTERROGATOR WHEN SHE WAS ACTING OUT THE VICTIM'S ROLE AND SAID SIXTY PER CENT OF RAVE CLAIMS A FORCE THAT'S A FICTIONAL NUMBER IS COMPLETE NONSENSE IT'S A NUN NUMBER BUT IF YOU GO INTO HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED DISBELIEVING
RATHER THAN KEEPING AN OPEN MIND THAT'S TERRIBLE SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD EITHER ASSUME ALL OF THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BRING CASES YOU KNOW WITH FOR MALICIOUS REASONS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THEY DO TEST ALL THE EVIDENCE INCLUDING THE ALLEGATIONS ROGER GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE A COURT IN AMERICA HAS ORDERED APPLE TO HELP THE F.B.I. GET INTO THE PHONE OF THE SAN BERNARDINO KILLER SIRED RIZ ONE FARRUKH HE WAS SHOT DEAD AFTER HE AND HIS WIFE KILLED FOURTEEN PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR THE DATA IN THE PHONE IS ENCRYPTED
AN APPLE SAYS NO ONE NOT EVEN THEM CAN ACCESS IT BUT NOW THE F.B.I. IS JUST ASKING FOR HELP UNLOCKING THE PHONE SOMETHING THAT APPLE IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE RESISTING DAVE LEE IS B. B. C. TECHNOLOGY REPORTER AND JOINED US ON THE LINE DAVID EXPLAIN CAN YOU EXPLAIN FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE COURT IS SAYING THAT APPLE SHOULD DO
THE COURT IS SEND THAT APPLE SHOULD HELP THE F.B.I. BASICALLY CARRY OUT WHAT'S CALLED A BRUTE FORCE ATTACK IN THIS IS WHERE YOU TRY EVERY POSSIBLE CODE TO GET INTO THE ICE SO LIKE WE ALL DO THIS I FIND IS LOCKED WITH A FOUR DIGIT PASS CODE AND IF THE F.B.I. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRY EVERY SINGLE COMBINATION THAT'S TEN THOUSAND IN THIS CASE AND AN UNTIL THEY GET THE RIGHT ONE AND UNLOCK THE PHONE
AND THAT WAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION THAT'S ON THERE WITHOUT DOING THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO IT AT ALL AND APPLE LIKE YOU MENTIONED SO THEY HAVE NO ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF DOING THAT EITHER THAT'S APPLE HAVE IN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS RESPONDED TO THIS THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THEY ARE GOING TO FIGHT THE COURT ORDER
AND THEY SAID TO THE DEMANDS TO DO THIS TO CREATE WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE CALL A BACK DOOR TO THE IRISH PHONE AWAY IN THAT WE PREVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THEY'RE SAYING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY CHILLING AS THOUGH IT'S ALTHOUGH THAT WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT A DEAD MAN DEAD KILLER SOMEONE WHO KILLED HE AND HIS WIFE KILLED FOURTEEN PEOPLE AND YET HE THEY'RE SAYING APPLE OR SAYING THAT EVEN SO THEY CAN'T HELP THE F.B.I.
YES APPLES THE FENCE HERE IS THE SAME DEFENCE THAT MOST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE AND THAT IF YOU MAKE A BACK DOOR TO THE ICE SCIENCE IT'S NOT JUST FOR THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU CURATOR BACK DAUGHTER EVERYBODY'S I THOUGHT INSIDE WHILE IN THIS INSTANCE
THE MORAL OBLIGATION SEEMS QUITE CLEAR AND INDEED APPLE HAVE SET THEMSELVES THEY'RE SHOCKED AND OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED THEY HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR TERRORISTS THEY SAY ISN'T QUITE AS CLEAR CUT IT'S JUST SOLVING THIS ONE ISSUE BY CURATING THIS BACK DOOR WHICH THEY SAY WILL BE VERY DANGEROUS THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY BUILT A BACKDOOR SAVOURY I PHONE IN EVERYBODY'S POCKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND THEY'RE REALLY OBVIOUSLY HESITANT TO CREATE ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THEY'LL CHALLENGE IT IN THE COURT AND IT WILL BE DOWN TO THE COURT TO DECIDE
YES IT WILL AND WE HAVEN'T YET OBVIOUSLY HEARD THE RESPONSE OF THE INVESTIGATORS TO APPLES RESISTANCE THEY EXPECTED APPLE TO RESIST THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TELLING US EARLIER I MEAN THE QUESTION IS FOUR FOUR APPLE AS WE HAVE THIS IS EVEN A FEASIBLE POSSIBILITY WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL THAT WILL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE ON THEIR OWN SOFTWARE THIS WILL BE EXTENDING THE DEBATE THAT'S BEEN HITTING SILICON VALLEY EVER SINCE THE SHOOTINGS TO PLACE
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CASES WHERE LOCKED PHONES HAVE CAUSED THE HEADACHE FOR THE POLICE AS WELL THIS IS GOING TO HEIGHTEN THE PRESSURE ON COMPANIES BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT AFTER APPLES LETTERS TODAY WHICH GOES INTO A LOT OF DEBTS ABOUT WHY THEY ARE GOING AGAINST THE ORDER I THINK THEY WILL HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY AND PROBABLY MANY OF THEIR USES AS WELL
DAVEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE OR MORE DECENTRALISED B. B. C. TO MATCH HER MORE DEVOLVED COUNTRY THAT IS WHAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WANTS FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE RENEWAL OF THE B.B.C.'S ROYAL CHARTER STEVE YOU'D A PRESENTER OF THE MEDIA SHOW ON RADIO FOUR IS WITH US NOW HOW WAS THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT SUGGESTING THINGS SHOULD WORK INSTEAD STEVE WHAT THIS THING IS A PRETTY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE YOU MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS THE FEDERAL ISATION OF THE B.B.C.
IN A NUTSHELL THERE SAYING BUT IN ORDER TO GIVE DE CHARACTER CREATE MORE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE LOCAL CONTROL IN SCOTLAND IN THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND OF THE B.B.C.'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THE B.B.C.'S COLLAR SHOULD BE RECONSTITUTED
IN A FORM WHICH MEANS THAT STILL PART OF THE B.B.C. BUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OF ALL LICENCE FEES RAISED IN SCOTLAND WHICH IT WOULD THEN HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER HOW ARE SPENT AND THE UP THAT THE SUNNY UPLANDS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE MORE CHANNELS FOR SCOTLAND IN RADIO AND T.V. MORE BESPOKE ONLINE SERVICES GREATER SUPPORT FOR SCOTTISH CREATIVE INDUSTRIES EXCEPT EXCEPT EXCEPT
THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS IN THE DETAIL FIRST OF ALL THE CONTEXT THIS IS POTENTIALLY VERY SERIOUS AND HE WAS A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE B.B.C. LORD PATTEN ONCE TOLD ME THAT HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ISSUE
WHAT'S POTENTIALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT AND MOST TOXIC THAT B. B. C. FACED IT MODERN BECAUSE IT FRAGMENTS IT BECAUSE HE COULD PULL IT APART NOW SIR AND ALSO OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT WHAT REACTION U.K. GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO ALL THE CIRCUIT AGAIN IS UNKNOWN AT THIS POINT BUT REMEMBER THEY JUST FOUGHT A HARD
CAMPAIGN AGAINST FOR A NO VOTE IN THE INDIE REF AND THIS LOOKS FOR ALL THE WORLD A BIT LIKE SORT OF TRYING TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TAKING U.K. INSTITUTION PULLING IT APART BUT IT DOESN'T ISN'T THERE AN ASSUMPTION IN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT SCOTTISH VIEWERS AND LISTENERS WANT MORE BESPOKE CONTENT FOR SCOTLAND RATHER THAN ENJOYING THE PAN U.K. SERVICES I WAS IF I WAS IN SCHOOL I THINK I'D WANT BOTH BUT THE PROBLEM IS IN THE NUMBERS SO THREE ROUGHLY SPEAKING BACK IN THE OLD MONEY BACK OF A FAG PACKET APOLOGIES
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION POUNDS OF LICENCE FEES TWO HUNDRED MILLION OR THEREABOUTS SPENT ON CONTENT FOR SCOTLAND AND SCOTTISH PRODUCTION FOR THE U.K. NETWORKS LEAVES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY WHICH IS
THE MONEY YOU WOULD YOU COULD USE SOME OFF TO DO THE NEW THINGS WE'VE GOT TO DO OR IT'S A FAIR PRICE PAID FOR ALL THE U.K. NETWORK CONTENT THAT VIEWERS THAN LISTEN TO SCOTLAND ENJOY SO THE THE SO THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT'S VIEW IS THAT LICENCE PRESENT SCOTLAND A NET
CONTRIBUTORS AND OTHER WORDS THAT THEY PUT IN MORE THAN THEY GET OUT THE B.B.C.'S HONEST OF YOU HAVING RUN THE NUMBERS IS THAT VIEWERS OR LISTENERS I SUPPOSE IN SCOTLAND ON NET
RECIPIENTS WHO WAS THAT THEY ALREADY GET BACK MORE IN VALUE TERMS AND THEY PUT IN IF THERE'S NO SPACE IN THE NUMBERS THEN
THE EFFECTS OF THIS IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU GET TO THE DETAIL IT'S REALLY QUITE CORROSIVE HAS HER SAY IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PULL THE B. B. C. A PART AS A U.K. WIDE INSTITUTION BUT HOW INFLUENTIAL IS THIS ARGUMENT GOING TO BE IN THE BIG PICTURE OF CHARTER RENEWAL
DIFFICULT TO SAY I THINK I MEAN SOME THINGS ARE EASY THE SCOTS LOCAL SCOTTISH SIX IS A SYMBOLIC THING THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT USED IN SCOTLAND WOULD BE CONTROLLED IN SCOTLAND YOU KNOW THAT IT WOULD THAT EDITOR IN SCOTLAND WOULD HAVE CONTROL OF WHICH ITEMS TO RUN IN WATER HOLE HALF HOUR WOULD BE COMPLETELY DIF WHAT IT IT WOULD BE ORGANISED FOR SCOTTISH VIEWERS
THAT ACTUALLY VIC TODAY TECHNOLOGICALLY VERY EASY TO DO DOESN'T REQUIRE TOSSED CHARD TO CHANGE MY GUESS IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WILL HAPPEN MORE FUNDAMENTALLY WILL BE B. C. SCOTLAND BECOME
PART OR BECOME FEDERAL ISED BECAUSE BY THE WAY THIS IS BEING WATCHED WITH RAPT ATTENTION IN WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND YOU CAN ALL SEE THIS COMING INTO THE SIMPLIFIED THE SIMPLE NOTION WOULD BE TO FEDERAL ASS TO B. B. C. TO HAVE SEPARATE ENTITIES IN SCOTLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND AND WHAT'S LEFT OF ENGLAND AS IT WERE WITH THEIR OWN BUDGETS WHICH THEY THEN EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE PROBLEM IN SCOTLAND DOING THAT OUT OF IT
WHEN YOU COME TO A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE VALUES THAT VIEWERS AND LISTENERS SCOTLAND GET FROM U.K. WIDE SERVICES OR SAY THE B.B.C. THINKS THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE FULL VALUE AND THINKS THEY'RE PAYING VASTLY MORE THAN THE FULL VALUE THE B. B. C. WOULD BE LEFT IN A POSITION WHERE IN ORDER TO DELIVER EQUITY THE LICENCE PAYERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES IT MAY WELL BE THE SCOTTISH LISTENERS AND VIEWERS WOULD BE WORSE OFF IN A FEDERAL I STRUCTURE AND THEY ARE NOW
STEVE HEWLETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY MUST BE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ONE IMAGINES HE'S PROBABLY NOT USED TO BEING TURNED AWAY FROM ANYWHERE BUT DURING A POST GRAMMYS PARTY ON MONDAY NIGHT OR BOUNCER APPEARED TO SHUT THE DOOR ON THE BEATLES STAR
SOMEONE WAS FILMING THE OCCASION AND IT WAS CAPTURED BY THE WEBSITE T.M. SAID
WELL WE'VE GOT A V.I.P. WE'VE GOTTA GO NOW WHO WILL LET YOU
GUYS YOU WORK I THINK YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR
THAT PHRASE HELL V.I.P. IS NOW TRENDING ON TWITTER AND WE'RE JOINED BY THEIR SON'S HEAD OF SHOWBIZ DAN WOULDN'T GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU WATCH THE VIDEO IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THAT I MEAN HE WAS OUTSIDE THE DOOR FOR QUITE A LONG TIME CLEARLY NOT ALLOWED TO GET IN
I DON'T THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT'S MERE MORTALS HAVE TO FACE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET US INTO A HOLLYWOOD CLUB BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST YOU'RE NOT GETTING IN AND THERE'S THIS HORRIBLE THING THAT PROBABLY IF HE WAS WITH A MEMBER OF A REALITY CLAN LIKE THE KARDASHIAN SOMETHING LIKE THE VELVET ROPE WOULD HAVE BEEN LISTED AND HE WOULD HAVE WALKED STRAIGHT EMBOLUS OF BEATLE PAUL MCCARTNEY COULDN'T GET INTO THE CLUB
WE'RE THE WRAP HER TIGER WAS PERFORMING WHAT'S INTERESTING NOW THOUGH THE CLUB HAS GONE INTO FULL DAMAGE CONTROL MODE IT'S CALLED THE ARGYLE AND HOLLYWOOD AND SAID LOOK WE DIDN'T TURN MACCA AWAY IN FACT HE WAS TRYING TO GO TO MARK RONSON'S PARTY AT A DIFFERENT VENUE AND WE JUST POINTED HIM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT OR INDEED SOUND LIKE THAT FROM HIS REACTION
ABSOLUTELY NOT END HE'S HE'S HE'S WITH DICK WHO OBVIOUSLY WON ALBUM OF THE YEAR THE GRAND LAST YEAR AND HITS THE COMET WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO WE'VE GOT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WE HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER HIT BEX'S MAYBE NEXT YEAR PAUL BUT LOOK THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE
IT'S SORT OF A HUGE TRAINED IN HOLLYWOOD WITH THESE BOUNCERS ARE VERY MUCH DO DROWN THESE HUGE VENUES BASED ON WHO HAPPENS TO APPEAR ON THEIR CLIPBOARD AND IT CAN BE A MESSY PROBLEM IF YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE IT CAN ALSO GIVE THEM A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLICITY I MEAN CLEARLY NOT IF THEY'RE TURNING AWAY NATIONAL TREASURE LIKE SIR PAUL BUT SOMEBODY ELSE IT MIGHT GIVE HIM SOME GOOD PUBLICITY
WELL YES OF COURSE THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS YOU KNOW A COLOUR MANCHESTER MADE A VERY BIG THING ABOUT HAVING TURNED AWAY JUSTIN BEEPER BUT THEY HAVE BEEN A FEW OTHER HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLES OF THIS RECENTLY JAMES HACKER THE CASINOS TYCOON AND AUSTRALIA WHO'S NOW ENGAGED TO MARIAH CAREY WAS ACTUALLY TURNED AWAY OVER NEW YEAR FROM HIS OWN VINEYARD

ABSOLUTELY ALTHOUGH AFTER THE GRAMMYS I THINK THAT IS ONE NIGHT IN HOLLYWOOD WE'RE ALL THESE CLUBS DO GO PARTICULARLY MAD AND I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN CASES WHERE IF YOU ARE WITH A BIG STAR LIKE RIHANNA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN GET ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE AND AT ONE TIME AND NO ONE'S CHICKS SO IT IS I JUST IT'S KIND OF BEEN A SLIGHT WAKE UP CALL FOR HIM

WELL THERE YOU GO SORTED ALL THAT OUT DAMN BUTTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANOTHER HARSH LESSON TO HAVE TO DO JUST THE TIME IS FIVE TO NINE
HOW HAPPY OUR CHILDREN IN ENGLAND WELL ACCORDING TO A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL STUDY ENGLAND RANKS THIRTEEN OUT OF SIXTEEN COUNTRIES WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN'S LIFE SATISFACTION THE REPORT ASKED ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND EIGHT YEAR OLDS FROM SIXTEEN COUNTRIES WHAT THEY DO FEEL AND WANT AND CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION PROFESSOR JONATHON BRADSHAW IS PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL POLICY
UNIVERSITY OF YORK AND HE CO EDITED THE REPORT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT'S IT'S PRETTY DEPRESSING THAT ENGLAND ARE RANKS IN THIS POSITION YES IT IS AND IT WAS THE LARGEST STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE OF EIGHT YEAR OLDS
AT A CONSIDERABLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF COUNTRIES FROM VERY POOR COUNTRIES TO RICH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHERE DOWN THERE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LEAGUE TABLE I'M AFRAID AND IT WAS IT'S ENGLAND WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE POSITION IS IN SCOTLAND AND WALES NO WE ONLY STUDDED CHILDREN IN ENGLAND IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY BECAUSE IT WAS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CHILDREN'S SOCIETY AND THEY WORK IN ENGLAND
AND WHAT ARE THE REASONS WHY WHAT WERE YOU ASKING THEM AND WHAT WERE THEY SAYING WE WERE ASKING THEM ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THEIR LIVES GENERALLY BUT CHILDREN EVERYWHERE ARE HAPPY AND SO THIS IS COMPARATIVE DATA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE COMPARATIVELY COMPARATIVELY WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OUR CHILDREN AREN'T SO HAPPY
THE THE THE THE THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY SEEM TO BE LEAST HAPPILY IN WE'RE IN AND IN RELATION TO THEIR SCHOOLING THEM THAN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WERE TEACHERS IN THEIR SCHOOL EXPERIENCE IN THEIR SATISFACTION WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL
THEY WERE ALSO EXTREMELY UNHAPPY ABOUT THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY LOOK AND THEIR OWN BODIES AND WE WERE PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO FIND THAT CHILLED THESE EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN ENGLAND WERE REPORTING OF COMPARATIVELY HIGH RATES OF BULLYING IN SCHOOL AND BEING LEFT OUT AND WE KNOW FROM OTHER WORKS THAT BULLYING AND EXCLUSION FROM FRIENDSHIPS AS A PARTICULARLY DAMAGING EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN
SO WHO WHAT WHAT COUNTRIES WERE HIGHER ON THE LIST THAN US AND WHO SHOULD WE LOOK TOWARDS MORE FAVOURITE WELL ROMANIA CAME TOP OF THE LEAGUE TABLE POLAND NORWAY WAS MUCH BETTER THAN US SPAIN EVEN TURKEY THE TURKISH CHILDREN WERE BETTER WE WEREN'T AS BAD AS SOUTH KOREA SOUTH CRIM CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY MISERABLE AND OUR CHILDREN NOT SURPRISING THEY WANT AS BADLY OFF AS CHILDREN IN ETHIOPIA IN THE PAUL WHICH CAUSE MUCH POORER COUNTRIES
BUT INDEED I'M LOOKING AT THE TO THE TABLE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE FORTY I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MEASURE IT FORTY ONE PER CENT IN THE IN ENGLAND WERE
WHAT REPORTING BEING FEELING GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES YES
WHICH IS WHICH WHETHER IT YOU MEAN YOU MIGHT COMPARE I MEAN I THINK REMAIN IS FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT BUT FORTY OR FORTY ONE PERCENT IT'S VERY LOW I'M IN THAT IT'S A SORT OF DEPRESSING A STATISTIC WHEN PRESUME MOST PEOPLE THEY LOOK BACK TO THE TIME THEY WERE EIGHT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE HAPPIEST TIMES THEN I YES I MEAN I CAN BUT I THINK THAT THAT DOES THAT MOST CHILDREN ARE HAPPY THERE'S A TALE OF CHILDREN WHO ARE BUT BUT WHAT WELL PARTICULARLY UNHAPPY AND THE TAIL IN ENGLAND IS IS LARGER THAN OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IT'S QUITE SMALL IN THAT BUT NINE PER CENT
OF THAT SHORT OF OUR EIGHT YEAR OLDS FORM BUT PERFORM BELOW THE MIDDLE OF THE BUT OF THE OF THE LEAGUE TABLE SO THEY SO SO I DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE THE MISERABLE NATURE OF EIGHT YEAR OLD CHILDREN LOOK AT THIS JUST COMPARATIVELY WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS WE MIGHT ME SO WE MIGHT LOOK AT COUNTRIES LIKE REMAIN HER AND SEE HOW THEY'RE TREATING THEIR CHILDREN TO GET SOME LESSONS FOR US INDEED AND I THINK PROBABLY LOOKING AT AT AT AT THAT THEY REGIMES IN SCHOOLS IN THESE COUNTRIES MIGHT WE MIGHT LEARN LESSONS FROM
