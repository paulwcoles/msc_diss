THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JOHN IT IS NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX SO MUCH WAS THE SAME SO MUCH WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT HERE IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT STILL FLYING THE UNION JACK ALONGSIDE THE TWENTY SEVEN OTHER FLAGS OF THE Y. YOU STILL ON TOP OF THE AGENDA IS NEED ALWAYS BRITAIN'S TORTURED RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS EUROPEAN CLUB STILL HERE THE PRIME MINISTER BUT NOW
HE'S GONE LATE LAST NIGHT DAVID CAMERON'S FELLOW E.U. LEADERS FOR NOW BADE HIM FAREWELL TODAY THEY WILL MEET WITHOUT HIM SPEAKING AFTER THE LEADERS' SUMMIT DINNER THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGLER MERKEL SAID THE DISCUSSIONS HAD REFLECTED THE FACT
THIS WAS A SEA CHANGE A WATERSHED MOMENT A HISTORIC MOMENT SHE SAID THAT EUROPEAN LEADERS HAD TO BE READY TO TAKE ACTION AS FINANCIAL MARKETS WOULD BE LESS PATIENT THAN POLITICIANS TO LEARN WHAT WOULD FOLLOW NEXT
IF GIGLI THE BED SITUATION
IN A WAY IS CHARACTERISED BY TURMOIL BY TURBULENCE IS THE WORLD IS NOT WAITING FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION TO MAKE UP ITS MIND AND WE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE INSTABILITY WITH THE IMPACT OF CRISES IN OUR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD SO WE HAVE TO SHOW A BREAD IN THIS ACT
MOST IMPATIENT OF ALL PERHAPS JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HE IS PRESSING BRITAIN TO GET ON WITH FORMALLY FILING FOR DIVORCE ONCE WE HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER THEY WANT THIS
I'VE GOT TO BE SEEN AS SOON AS
POSSIBLY BUT IF SOMEONE FROM THE REMAINING CAMP WE'VE BECOME BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
THIS HAS TO BE DONE INTO BEAKS AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT IF THE NEXT BRITISH P.M. IS COMING FROM THE LIVE COMPARING IT SHOULD BE DONE TODAY AFTER HAS A POINT
A MESSAGE TO BORIS IN OTHER WORDS NOW LEADER AFTER LEADER HERE INSISTED THAT BRITAIN COULD NOT HOPE TO HAVE
THE BENEFITS OF EUROPE WITHOUT PAYING THE COSTS WE COULD NOT IN OTHER WORDS EXPECT TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO BUY AND SELL IN THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT ACCEPTING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THE PRIME MINISTER AGREED THAT HIS SUCCESSOR WHOEVER HE POINTEDLY SAID SHE OR HE WAS WOULD HAVE TO MAKE COMPROMISES
WHILE WE SEEK THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE CAN AFTER LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HOW ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP WITHOUT SOME OF THE COSTS OF MEMBERSHIP THAT'S SOMETHING THE NEXT BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO THINK THROUGH VERY CAREFULLY
THEY WILL PERHAPS HAVE TO THINK EVEN MORE CAREFULLY THAN THIS GOVERNMENT DID ABOUT A REFERENDUM AND WHAT MIGHT FOLLOW IT
ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S LOOK AT WHAT THE PAPER'S HERE IN EUROPE ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS SUMMIT THE LOCAL PAPER THE BRUSSELS PAPER LE SOIR SAYS NO TO EUROPE ALLA CARTS FOR PAULIE BRITANNIQUE FOR THE BRITISH OF COURSE AND IT SAYS EUROPEAN LEADERS WANT TO MOVE FASTER NOW THE BRITAIN IS GETTING OUT OF EUROPE
WHAT IS MOST STRIKING THERE MICHELLE IN THIS PAPER IS AS YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO AND THEN PAGE THREE AND PAGE FOUR AND PAGE FIVE AND YOU KEEP GOING WITH THE HEADLINES THE MOOR ON THE APP RAIL OR BREAKS IT
THE WORLD OF THE BREAD TO ONE OF THE PAPER FOR YOU FROM EUROPE ARE JEREMY'S PAPERS YOU DON'T SHOWS ITEM HAS A GRIM FACED DAVID CAMERON AND IT SAYS THAT HE IS LOOKING TO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE WE SET THE AGENDA IS THE DEFIANT MESSAGE FROM ANGLE MERKEL WHO SAID BUY THE PAPER TO HAVE DAMPENED HOPES THAT A BRITISH WITHDRAWAL COULD BE CORRECTED I WANT TO SAY SHE IS QUOTED AS SAYING QUITE FRANKLY I SEE NO WAY TO DO THIS TO REVERSE IT AGAIN
THE BRUSSELS SUMMIT AND DAVID CAMERON'S APPEARANCE THERE AS WELL AS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY PROVIDE THE LEAD FOR MOST OF THE PAPERS HERE THE TIMES IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES UM TALKING ABOUT DAVID CAMERON BLAMING THE BRICKS ARE DEFEAT ON E.U. FAILURE TO TACKLE IMMIGRATION AS ONE'S JEREMY CORBIN IS CONCERNED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE AMONG HIS M. PEAS YESTERDAY THE EDITORIAL IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS
THE QUESTION IS NO LONGER WHETHER MISTER CORBIN SHOULD CONTINUE TO LEAD BUT WHETHER HE IS IN FACT ANY LONGER LEADING AT ALL THE UNAVOIDABLE ANSWER IS THAT HE HAS CEASED TO DO SO IN ANY ORDINARY AND SENSE IT SAYS THAT IF MISTER CORBIN CLINGS TO HIS LEADERSHIP THE PAPER SAYS THAT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN BUT NOR SHOULD MISTER CORBIN SUPPORTERS BE ASKED TO FOLD WITHOUT SOME REASSURANCE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS VICTORY LAST YEAR REFLECTED DEEP DISCONTENT WITH NEW LABOUR'S ECONOMIC
AND FOREIGN POLICIES THE COCKBURN EXPERIMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OVER AT WESTMINSTER SAYS THE GUARDIAN AND AS FAR AS THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP RACE IS CONCERNED NOMINATIONS OPEN TODAY AND THE TELEGRAPH HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH MICKEY MORGAN WHO IS CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP AND IN IT SHE SAYS POLITICIANS SHOULD LEVEL WITH PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT IMMIGRATION IS AN INEVITABLE AND AN OFTEN BENEFICIAL PART OF MODERN LIFE WILL BE SPEAKING TO LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
EVENTS AT ISTANBUL AIRPORT HAPPENED YESTERDAY EVENING AND SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE IN THIS MORNING'S PAPERS ALTHOUGH THE DEATH TOLD CLIMBED QUITE LATE LAST NIGHT WE NOW KNOW THAT THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARNAGE THAT BEGAN IN THE DEPARTURES HALL OF THE AIRPORT THIRTY SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INJURED OR A STUMBLE CORRESPONDENT MARK LOWE AND FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT UP IN IT
WELL I WAS FLYING IN FROM SWEAR I'VE BEEN COVERING THE ENGLAND ICELAND MATCH AND WE LANDED INTO ISTANBUL THAT'S A AIRPORT THE MAIN AIRPORT IN THE THIRD BUSIEST IN EUROPE AND THERE WAS NO WARNING AT ALL OR NO CONCERN AT ALL AND THEN AS WE WERE TAXIING TURNED ON MY PHONE OF COURSE GOT ALL THEIR MESSAGES
AND THE ATTACK HAD HAPPENED ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE WE LANDED AND WE WERE THEN HELD ON THE ON THE PLANE ON THE TARMAC FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS PEOPLE ARE VERY CALM ON BOARD BUT IT EVERYBODY WAS VERY AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH MESSAGES
WE THEN WERE ALLOWED TO DISEMBARK AND WENT TOWARDS THE TERMINAL BUILDING AND BUSES AND WERE HELD THERE FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND IT WAS CHAOS REALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO THE TERMINAL BUILDING QUEUING UP AT PASSPORT CONTROL AND WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE WERE THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS INVOLVED FROM WHICH GROUP WHO DO YOU THINK THEY WERE
THE PRIME MINISTER WENT TO THE AIRPORT AND HE SAID THAT THE SUSPICION IS VERY MUCH ON SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IF THAT IS PROVEN IT WOULD BE BY NO MEANS THE FIRST ATTACK BY EYE ASS ON TURKEY SOIL THEY HAVE LAUNCHED VARIOUS ATTACKS IN THE LAST YEAR THE DEADLIEST OF WHICH WAS BACK IN OCTOBER IN ANKARA THAT KILLED OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS ONE EARLIER THIS MONTH ACTUALLY IN THIS IN ISTANBUL BUT KILLED
DOESN'T PEOPLE IT IS NOT THE ONLY GROUP THAT HE'S LAUNCHING ATTACKS HERE THERE IS ALSO A RESURGENCE OF KURDISH MILITANCY THE P.K.K. KURDISH MILITANTS AND THEY HAVE ALSO LAUNCHED ATTACKS ACROSS TURKEY NOT JUST IN THE CURD IT PREDOMINANT KURDISH AREAS IN THE SOUTH EAST BUT ALSO ISTANBUL AND ANKARA
TURKEY SIMPLY FINDS ITSELF AT THE CENTRE OF A MULTIPLE TERROR THREATS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO STAND WITH IT AND IN THIS CASE THE TARGET A HIGH PROFILE PLACE A BUSY PLACE A PLACE THAT MANY VISITORS TO TURKEY WOULD KNOW I HAVE FREQUENTLY THOUGHT MICHELLE ACTUALLY AS AS AS I HAVE DRIVEN TOWARDS THE AIRPORT
A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I'VE LIVED HERE THAT IT IS POTENTIALLY A SOFT TARGET BECAUSE CARS THAT DRIVE HIM TO THE AIRPORT PERIMETER OF VERY INFREQUENTLY CHECKED EVEN IN THE LAST YEAR WHEN ATTACKS HAVE BEEN STEPPED UP IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU ACTUALLY TRY TO ENTER THE TERMINAL BUILDING THEIR X. RAY MACHINES ARE METAL DETECTORS THEN THE SECURITY STARTS BUT CLEARLY IN THE WAKE OF THIS DEVASTATING ATTACK SECURITY WILL BE STEPPED UP BUT IT WILL BE TOO LATE FOR A COUNTRY THAT IS REELING AND IS PROFOUNDLY SHAKEN BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED MARK LOAN THANK YOU
IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW THOSE VOLATILE MARKETS HAVE COOLED A LITTLE AND EVEN BOUNCE BACK AS WELL BUT WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR BUSINESS POST REFERENDUM THE MANY NOS DOMINIKA COME UP HERE WITH THE BUSINESS NEWS MORNING ON IT THANK YOU THANK YOU THE MARKETS HAVE COME THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED CLIMB TWO AND A HALF PER CENT YESTERDAY THE DOW JONES AND AMERICAN IN JAPAN WERE ALSO POSITIVE TERRITORY AS A SINCE FINALLY THE COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO CHART WHAT THEIR FUTURE MIGHT BE AFTER THE BRICKS IT VOTE
TRYING TO BE DOWN THE LINE TO DISCUSS OPPORTUNITIES AS GERHARD LINES CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST FOR NICK WEALTH A MEMBER OF A COLUMNIST FOR BRICKS AND A FORMER ADVISOR TO BORIS JOHNSON WHEN HE WAS MAYOR OF LONDON
GERHARD WE HAD PETER ARE HARGREAVES ON THE FOUNDER OF HARGREAVES LANDS DOWN IN THE WEEK HE MADE A VERY GOOD CASE FOR MANUFACTURING WEAKER POUND HELPING MANUFACTURERS CAN YOU MAKE A SIMILAR CASE FOR THEIR SERVICES COMPANIES AND OUR ECONOMY WHICH OTHER THE BIGGEST PART OF THE ECONOMY IN A PARTICULAR FOR THE CITY OF LONDON
GOOD MORNING WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK IT WAS CLEARLY POSITIVE TO MAKE THE CASE MANUFACTORY I THINK THERE IS A VERY STRONG POSITIVE ON FOR MANUFACTURING BUT LIKEWISE I THINK THE U.K. SERVICE SECTOR IS IN INCREDIBLY STRONG POSITION PARTICULARLY THE CITY OF LONDON THE CITY OF LONDON HAS THE SKILLS THE KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT LONDON REMAINS THE MAJOR FINANCIAL CENTRE OF EUROPE AND IT'S VITAL TO STRESS THAT IF WE HAD STAYED IN THE E.U. THERE WAS A SLOW TICKING TIME BOMB UNDERNEATH THE CITY
MANY FUTURE PROBLEMS ABOUT TO HIT IT SOME RESPECTS LEAVING THE E.U. MEANS THE ISSUES COME TO THE FORE IMMEDIATELY PASSPORT EEN BEAM ONE OF THEM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT AGAIN ARTICLE FIFTY WHEN IT'S EXERCISE MEANS FOR TWO YEARS THINGS DON'T IMMEDIATELY CHANGE THAT GIVES EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPOSITION THEMSELVES YOU TALKED YOU TALKED ABOUT A TICKING TIME BOMB MAYBE IF HE'S ALREADY GONE OFF BECAUSE PASSPORT IT WHICH IS JUST A FANCY WAY OF SAYING THAT THE CITY IS ABLE TO SUMMAT SERVICES INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION SINGLE MARKET
IT'S CLEAR THAT THAT IS NOW UP FOR GRABS ISN'T IT AND IF THAT HAPPENS I'LL BE GOING TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF JOB LOSSES IN THE CITY NO IS THE ANSWER TO THE LAST PART THAT I THINK BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S I LIKE MANY OTHERS POINTED OUT THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME NEAR TO ISSUES AND IN TERMS OF THE CITY PASSPORTS INURA CLEARING BUT BOTH OF THOSE
I THINK IT'S FIRST TO REASSURE PEOPLE BEFORE THE END OF ARTICLE FIFTY FINISHES IN TERMS OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS SOMETHING CALLED MIFFY TO COMES INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY VALVE FOR THE CITY IN THIS AREA HAVE PASSPORTS BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS HE'S FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN EQUIVALENCE BECOMES THE ISSUE SOUNDS QUITE TECHNICAL BUT REGULATOR EQUIVALENCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THE CITY AND LONDON HAS
ALL COMPANIES WORKING IN MY THIRD COUNTRY AS THE U.K. WITH THEN P. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL INTO THE E. OR Y. YOU AREA NOW THAT'S AN IMPORTANT SAFETY AGAINST WHICH WE SHOULD REST BUT BEFORE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS PASSPORT IN UP FRONT AND IT WAS MADE CLEAR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS THAT PASSPORT IS NOT ONLY IN THE COACH BOY ISSUE BUT IT'S A TWO WAY YOU SURE
THAT HIS OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE Y. A. AREA NEED TO PASSPORT THEIR SERVICES INTO LONDON AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT LONDON HAS THE CAPITAL MARKET BUT THE E. U. NEEDS SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD IGNORE IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE QUITE PRAGMATIC WHEN WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PASSPORTS BUT UNGRAMMATICAL SAID YESTERDAY NO CHERRY PICKING I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SAID THAT'S A DIRECT THREAT TO THE CITY OF LONDON YOU CAN'T HAVE FREE MOVEMENT YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR SERVICES WELL IF ANY FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL HAVE THOSE JOBS OVER HERE IN FRANKFURT OR PARIS LOOK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THERE WAS A BIG CHANGES TO CONTRACTS TO TRY AND MOVE CUP WITH BUSINESSES FROM LONDON TO FRANKFORT TRADING TESTS WERE FORCED TO MOVE WITHIN TWO YEARS THEY WERE BACK IN LONDON FRANKFURT DOESN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WILL BE APPROACHING IT DIFFERENTLY BUT THE KEY ISSUE IN THE TERMS OF GLOBAL FINANCE IS THIS IS A GLOBAL BUSINESS
IN TERMS OF WESTERN EUROPE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT WHILE OTHER COUNTRIES WILL SAY THE THINGS THEY ARE SAYING WE NEED TO OBVIOUSLY ADDRESSED HEAD ON SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT SPEAK QUITE REASSURED IN ONE RESPECT ABOUT ALL THE FACILITIES BEEN IN PLACE THAT PUTS LONDON STOOD IN THE STRONG POSITION NOT WITHSTANDING SOME IMMEDIATE ISSUE SUCH AS DURER CLEARING AND PASSPORT THING FINALLY JA WHAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE OF EUROPE THAT DOES BRICKS ALEXIA ACTUALLY OPEN TO NEW HORIZONS FOR SERVICES COMPANIES OH ABSOLUTELY
REMEMBER IN TERMS OF THE SINGLE MARKET IT NEVER WORKED FULLY PROPERLY IN SERVICES ANYWAY EUAN FINANCIAL SERVICES SO WE CAN STILL MOST EFFECTIVELY CONTINUE ON THAT BUT IN TERMS OF SERVICES WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY RECOGNISES THAT WE NEED TO FIRST FREE OURSELVES FROM THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE WITHIN THE E.U. AND THEN WE NOW NEED TO START POSITION OURSELVES NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WESTERN EUROPE
IN LONDON AND THE CITY REMAINS VERY IMPORTANT BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN P. BUSINESS ISLAMIC FINANCE AND ALSO SOME OF THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT BUT VERY IMPORTANT
THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WE NEED TO HAVE POLITICAL STABILITY CLARITY AND POLICY BUT WITHIN THAT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO START POSITIONING OURSELVES TO ACTUALLY SEE STRONGER GROWTH IN THE U.K. HELPED BY MORE CONSERVATORY FISCAL AS WELL AS MONETARY POLICY BUT REST ASSURED SERVICES LIKE MANUFACTURING DESPITE THE NEAR TERM UNCERTAINTY OF WHICH THERE ARE SOME WILL BE WELL PLACED IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERHARD LIONS
YESTERDAY VODAFONE RACE THE PROSPECT THAT IT COULD MOVE ITS HEAD CALLED US OUT OF THE U.K. AFTER THE BRICKS HAVE VOTE I SPOKE TO ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE FOR TURA KALEIL LAST WEEK BEFORE THE VOTE AND HE MADE A PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THE COMPANY NEEDED IF IT WERE TO STAY
NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT BREAKS IT REALLY WOULD BE A NOBODY KNOWS THIS SHAPE BUT THESE WOULD DATE SO IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT IN PRINCIPLE WE LIKE BRITAIN WAS TAME WELL ENGRAVED AND THEN HAVING A HEAD PORTER IMBREKE AND HAS PROVED TO BE AN ADVANTAGE
GREG DID CLAMS WITH RESTRICTIONS OF MOMENT OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OR FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL THEN OF COURSE WE SHOULD RECONSIDER OUR POSITION BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN AND IF IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS WITH HAL CHANGES TO THOSE TWO IMPORTANT THINGS I'M JOINED NOW BY BRENDA KELLY THE INDEPENDENT MARKET ANALYST
DISCUSS THAT AND THE OTHER BIG MARKET STORIES YOU THE TOUR WAS A VEILED THREAT BUT IT WAS A THREAT NONETHELESS SHALL WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY DO YOU THINK FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES REALLY WILL LEAVE LONDON WE'VE HAD SABRE RATTLING BEFORE BY H.S.B.C. AND OTHERS OVER THE BANK
IT NEVER CAME TO MUCH AS US A REPEAT OF THAT WELL IT COULD VERY WELL BE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME I THINK IT'S VERY UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SOME OF THESE LARGER COMPANIES AND MOST WILL NEED THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE CAPITAL AND GOODS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE STATUS QUO AND OF COURSE THAT'S STATUS QUO FEELS A LITTLE BIT SORT OF IN THERE IN THE BALANCE AT THE MOMENT OBVIOUSLY
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO REALLY WAIT AND SEE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AHEAD OF US UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GET A GOVERNMENT IN PLACE GET A LEADER IN PLACE AND GET THE ARTICLE FIFTY ACTUALLY ACTIVATORS AND SEE WHERE WE ARE THEY'RE IN TRY TO NEGOTIATIONS BUT WE CAN PROBABLY EXPECT TO SEE THIS FOR A CHOPPING US AMONGST THOSE COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE THIS FREE MOVEMENT OVER THE COMING WEEKS
THERE COULD BE ONE IMMEDIATE BIG TIS COULDN'T HEAR THERE WAS A THERE WAS A DEAL MOOTED A MERGER BETWEEN THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE BIGGEST GERMAN MARKETS COMPANY DEUTSCHE BURSAR SHAREHOLDERS GET TO VOTE ON THAT NEXT MONTH JULY THE FOURTH BUT LAST NIGHT THEY HAD OF THE GERMAN FINANCIAL MARKETS AUTHORITY SAID HE COULDN'T SEE IT
COULDN'T SEE IT GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON HE SAID HOW CAN YOU EVER HEADQUARTERS OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WELL CERTAINLY HAD THAT DOES THROW THAT PARTICULAR MURDER INTO A POTENTIAL DISARRAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE FINANCIAL WATCHDOG AND GERMANY HAS VERY LITTLE POWER TO BLOCK THIS PARTICULAR MERGER AND THE FINAL DECISION WILL BE TAKEN BY GERMANY IN THE ECONOMICS MINISTRY SO IT STILL HAS TO PASS ANTI TRUST SCROOGE SCRUTINY IN BRUSSELS IN ANY CASE BUT YES THERE IS A COULD POSSIBILITY DUFF PARTICULAR MERGER COULD BE TURNING INTO THE BALANCE ON THE BACK
THE U.K. NOT BEEN PART OF THE E.U. ANY LONGER AND IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A ROCKY TIME IN THE MARKETS FOR THE MARKETS HAVE REBOUNDED A BIT WHAT'S YOUR PICTURE WITH THE FOOTY ONE HUNDRED'S GOING FROM HERE MORE MORE VOLATILITY OR TWO YEARS OF CALM
I LIKE THE VERY BIG ENLARGED END OF THE SPECTRUM THERE I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OTHERS WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE AN UPSIDE IN THE FOOTSIE TODAY BEAR IN MIND THAT ON PROS DAY MARKETS WERE VERY UNPREPARED FOR THE LEA VOTE TO CARRY SO THEY HAD TO THEY CLIMBED QUITE A HIGH DISTANCE AND THEREFORE HAD TO CORRECT QUITE QUITE QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY
SO WE ARE SEEING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POSITIVE TOWN CERTAINLY YESTERDAY EXPECTING TO SEE THE FOOTY OPEN AGAIN HIYA TODAY BUT AGAIN THESE BIG SWINGS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE INDICATIVE OF UNCERTAINTY AND THIS VOLATILITY IN THE DOWN TREND THAT WE'RE A PUBLIC WANT TO SEE OVER THE NEXT COMING MONTHS THANK YOU MUCH GOING TO CARRY WELL ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER INSTALLMENT IN THE SOAP OPERA THAT IS

THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN DAVID CAMERON'S LAST EVER E.U. SUMMIT FINISHED WITH HER DINNER LATE LAST NIGHT HERE IN BRUSSELS ON THE MENU EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET NOT ON THE MENU ANY HINT OF THE SORT OF DEAL THAT THOSE WHO CAMPAIGNED TO LEAVE THE E.U. SAY THEY WANT IN OTHER WORDS ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE I LAST SAW CHRIS MORRIS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING IN THE SUMMIT CENTRE HE'S BACK HE IS OF COURSE THE B.B.C.'S EUROPE CORRESPONDENT MORNING TO YOU CHRIS
MORNING EXTRAORDINARY WORDS FROM A CLOSE ALLY OF DAVID CAMERON'S MARK RUTTER YESTERDAY WHICH YOU PICKED UP ON WHEN YOU ASKED HIM A QUESTION AT THE SUMMIT
YES ALONGSIDE THE WARM WORDS AND THERE WERE SOME WARM WORDS FLOATING AROUND YESTERDAY EVENING REGRET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE U.K. IS LEAVING MARK RITTER SAID LISTEN ENGLAND HAS COLLAPSED POLITICALLY MUM ARE TERRIBLY CONSTITUTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SO THE HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE END OF THE SUMMIT DAY I ASKED HIM WHAT WE HAVE LEFT HE SAID YOU HAD THE B. B. C. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A SOURCE OF GREAT COMFORT BUT HE ADDED RATHER MORE OMINOUSLY LISTEN I COMMENTED ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE U.K. SINCE LAST FRIDAY
ANYONE THINKING IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE MESSAGES THE USE OF THE LEADERS WANT TO GIVE OUT WHICH IS DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT TO OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO FOLLOW THE COURSE THAT MISTER CAMERON FOLLOWED
IT IS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANYONE THINKING THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON A DIVORCE ARE GOING TO BE EASY IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO THINK AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT WILL BE OFFERED DAVID CAMERON MADE IT VERY CLEAR DURING HIS INTERVENTION AT DINNER LAST NIGHT THAT HE BELIEVES HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE REFERENDUM RESULT IF HE'D BEEN GIVEN A LITTLE MORE
BY OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS TO CONTROL MIGRATION HE BELIEVES THE QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION COULD MAKE TALKS ON A FUTURE TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. YOU MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BUT WE HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF OTHER LEADERS A RANGE OF LEADERS YOU CANNOT DIVORCE THE IDEA OF FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET FROM THE IDEA OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THAT ISSUE IS GOING TO COME BACK AND THEY'RE BEDEVIL THIS RELATIONSHIP TIME AND AGAIN
AND BRIEFLY CHRIS IF YOU WOULD THIS MORNING SOMETHING VERY STRIKING A MEETING A SUMMIT BUT NO BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE
AND IT REALLY IS YOU KNOW IT'S AN OVER USED BUT IT IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT IT'S FORTY YEARS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS SINCE BRITAIN HAS NOT BEEN AT THE TABLE FOR A MAJOR E.U. MEETING AND WE COULD HEAR IN THE WORDS OF ANGELA MERKEL FOR EXAMPLE YESTERDAY EVENING AT THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR WISHFUL THINKING IT'S TIME FOR LOOKING AT REALITY THEY'RE BEGINNING TO MOVE ON ALREADY
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE Y. YOU MIGHT LOOK LIKE AS A UNION ARE TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF REFORM INTENT OF CHANGING THE UNION TO PERSUADE OTHER PEOPLE TO PERSUADE OTHER COUNTRIES NOT TO FOLLOW THE BRITISH PATH CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE PROCESS OF FINDING DAVID CAMERON SUCCESSOR BEGINS IN EARNEST TODAY WITH NOMINATIONS OPENING FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOR LABOUR MEANWHILE JEREMY CORBIN HAS SAID THAT HE WON'T BE RESIGNING DESPITE THE MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE PASSED BY A MAJORITY OF HIS M.P.S YESTERDAY NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR IS ON THE LINE LET'S TALK ABOUT LABOUR FIRST NORMAN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
QUITE LIKELY CIVIL WAR I THINK IS THE HONEST ANSWER JEREMY CORBIN HAS SHOWN HE'S NOT GOING TO GO I THINK EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO GO HE HAS PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO HAVE PRETTY MUCH
LOCKED HIM IN THE ROOM THROWN AWAY THE KEY AND SAID TO HIM YOU ARE NOT LEAVING INDEED MISTER CORBIN WILL TONIGHT BE ATTENDING A RALLY TO GALVANISE SUPPORT FOR THE LOOMING CLASH AHEAD AND CLASH THERE WILL BE I EXPECT HIS CRITICS TO UNVEILING SINGLE CONTENDER LATER TODAY MOST LIKELY ANGELA EAGLE WHO'S THOUGHT TO HAVE A GREATER BREADTH OF SUPPORT THEM TOM WATSON THAT I SUSPECT WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS BECAUSE
THEY WILL WANT TO FLAG UP THE LACK OF SUPPORT MISTER CORBIN HAS IN HIS DENUDED FRONT BENCHERS ANECDOTAL ASIDE THE S. AND P. APPARENTLY ARE TALKING ABOUT ASKING THE SPEAKER TO ALLOW THEM TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION BECAUSE ANGUS ROBERTSON HAS MORE M.P.S SUPPORTING HIM AND JEREMY CORBIN AND THEN WE WILL BE INTO A FULL BLOODED LEADERSHIP
CONTEST NOW AT THIS POINT IN NORMAL TIMES THE TRADE UNIONS WOULD STEP IN AND SAY TO MISTER CORBIN JEREMY I'M SORRY IT HASN'T WORKED OUT YOU'VE GOT TO STEP ASIDE BUT THESE ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES BECAUSE THE UNIONS THE BIG UNIONS AT THE MOMENT ARE SIGNALLING THEY ARE BEHIND MY ORGAN AND THEREFORE WE HAVE IN PROSPECT A CIVIL WAR WHERE THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY IS AT LOGGERHEADS WITH THE UNIONS AND VAST SWATHES OF THE PARTY IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO POINT TO WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT
THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY BELIEVE THEIR JOB IS TO DEFEND WORKING PEOPLE BY PRESENTING THEMSELVES AS AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT MISTER CORBIN AND HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THEIR TASK IS TO FORM A SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEY SOCIAL UPRISING TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF WORKING PEOPLE AND THAT AT THE HEART I THINK IS WHAT THIS DIVIDE IS ABOUT MEANWHILE ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE NOMINATIONS OPENING FOR THE LEADERSHIP THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON BORIS JOHNSON
THERESA MAY IN RECENT DAYS HOW LARGE FEEL DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET IT THERE IS A WHOLE CAVALCADE OF CONTENDERS I'VE COUNTED EIGHT AT THE LAST COUNT FIRST OUT OF THE BOX THEY WILL BE STEPHEN CRABB THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY WHO'LL BE PRESENTING HIMSELF AS A SORT OF BLUE COLLAR TORY APPEALING TO WORKING CLASS CONSERVATIVES POINTING TO A SUCCESS IN
WALES WERE THE TORIES TRADITIONALLY NOT DONE WELL BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT BORIS JOHNSON REMAINS THE CANDIDATES ARE BEATEN WHILE IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THERE ARE A LOT OF TORIES FRANKLY WOULD RATHER VOTE FOR A DEAD SHEEP THAN BORIS JOHNSON THE ANYONE BUT BORIS CAMPAIGN I CANNOT SEE HOW THEY STOP HIM AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE I THINK OVER THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS
IS BORIS JOHNSON OR RE PRESENTING HIMSELF TO THE TORY PARTY IS BORIS JOHNSON MARK ONE THE SOCIALLY LIBERAL MAYOR OF LONDON AND DISCARDING BORIS JOHNSON MARK TO THE POPULIST BRECK'S A TEAR AND SIGNIFICANTLY HE IS ALREADY ATTRACTING SUPPORT FROM PROMINENT ONE NATION TORIES LIKE NICHOLAS SOAMES AND INTERESTINGLY FROM PROMINENT REMAIN AS LIKE LIZ TRUST YOU ACTUALLY STOOD BESIDE GEORGE OSBORNE WHEN HE ISSUED HIS SO CALLED DOSSIER OF DOOM
AND IF IT GOES THROUGH AS I EXPECT TO BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY IN THE FINAL RUN OFF ON TORY M.P. SAID TO ME YESTERDAY THEY HAD A FUNDRAISING DINNER FOR BORIS JOHNSON AND THEY SOLD SO UNLIKE THREE HUNDRED TICKETS AT SIXTY AHEAD WHEN THEY HAD THE SAME PATRICE MADE THEY SOLD WHAT GRAND TWENTY OR THIRTY AT THIRTY POUNDS HEAD HARD TO SEE HOW BORIS JOHNSON STOP WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO SARGE EACH OTHER DOWN TO NICKY MORGAN LATER THIS MORNING NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH CAPTURES THE MOMENT WHEN DAVID CAMERON MET ANGELA MERKEL HERE IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY IT PICTURES THE PRIME MINISTER WITH HIS HEAD COCKED SMILING FAINTLY THE PAPER SAYS HE TOLD THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR THE LOST THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED
THE DAILY EXPRESS PUTS IT MORE POINTEDLY IT SAYS MY CAMERON TOLD FELLOW LEADERS THAT THE BRICKS IT VOTE WAS THEIR FAULT AS IT COULD BE PUT DOWN TO THEIR REFUSAL TO ALLOW THE U.K. TO STOP MASS MIGRATION THERE ARE CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF THE TORY LEADERSHIP RACE THE SUN SAYS BORIS JOHNSON HAS SURGED TO THE FRONT WITH ONE HUNDRED M. PEAS BACKING IN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THERESA MAY
HAS TAKEN AN EARLY LEAD SHATTERING THE ASSUMPTION THAT ONLY A BRECK'S A TEAR CAN LEAD THE PARTY THE FINANCIAL TIMES AGREES THAT A SENSE OF MOMENTUM HAS SWUNG BEHIND THE HOME SECRETARY AN ALLY OF THE CHANCELLOR TELLS THE PAPER THAT WITH MISSUS MAIN CHARGE THERE'D BE LESS OF A CLAMOUR FOR A GENERAL ELECTION BORIS JOHNSON ON THE OTHER HAND HAS NEVER SPOKEN AT THE DESPATCH BOX AND IT WOULD BE HARDER TO AVOID THE NEED FOR AN ELECTION IF HE WERE
I SAYS THAT JEREMY CORBIN HAS SHRUGGED OFF A BLISTERING DEFEAT IN A VOTE OF NO COMMS WITH CONFIDENCE AS IF IT WERE AN IRRELEVANCE SOURCE TELLS THE PAPER THE MISTER CORBIN'S REACTION TO THE RESULT WAS ABSOLUTELY NIL AND THAT HE REALLY HAS GOT THE HIDE OF A RHINO IN THE PAPERS ANALYSIS IF HE'S DETERMINED TO HANG ON IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW WE CAN BE OUSTED SO SOON AFTER GAINING AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE FROM ACTIVISTS
THE MIRROR REFLECTS ON IT GO NOW FRONT PAGE HEADLINE OF YESTERDAY THE PAPER'S EDITOR IN CHIEF SAYS HE HAD A LOT OF LETTERS AND IT PRINTS SOME OF THEM INCLUDING ONE FROM A TONY SCHOFIELD FROM BOLTON WHO WAS THE LAST DAY I'LL READ THE MIRROR AFTER OVER FIFTY YEARS HE SAYS IT MISTER CORBIN IS DEPOSED I'LL RESIGN FROM THE LABOUR PARTY AND VOTE GREEN BUT THE TIMES HAD AN EDITORIAL ARGUES THAT MYSTICAL BEEN MUST RESIGN IT SAYS HE NEEDS TO REFLECT ON HIS POSITION AND REALISE
IT'S HOPELESS THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING SENIOR E.U. OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATE IMPATIENCE AT BRITAIN'S DELAY IN TRIGGERING THE FORMAL DEPARTURE PROCESS BUT DAVID CAMERON IT IS FINAL SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS HAD BOTH SIDES HAD TO GET IT RIGHT SO THEY COULD ESTABLISH THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP FOR THE FUTURE
WELL AS THE FALL OUT FROM THE REFERENDUM RESULT CONTINUES TO RADICALLY RESHAPED THE POLITICAL SCENE HERE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MET IN EMERGENCY SESSION IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY WITH THE DETAILS HE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HIM THE HOLLYWOOD FILM STAR KEANU REEVES VISITED WESTMINSTER YESTERDAY IF HE'D COME TO SEE ALL THE POLITICAL DRAMA HE'D HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY HIS TRIP TO THE COMMONS CHAMBER WHERE A TREASURY MINISTER WAS GOING THROUGH THE FINER DETAILS OF THE TAX CHANGES SET OUT IN THE BUDGET
TO A VIRTUALLY DESERTED CHAMBER ALLOWS EACH MORE ROSSI TO MAKE A. PROVISIONAL GAR COUNTERACT SURE WHERE THEY BELIEVE ADDITIONAL TAXES AT THE ASSESSMENT TIME ALL THE POLITICAL SPECIAL EFFECTS WE'RE GOING ON ELSEWHERE NOT JUST IN THE LEADERSHIP TURMOIL FOR BOTH OPPOSITION AND GOVERNMENT BEING PLAYED OUT IN THE ROOMS AND CORRIDORS AT WESTMINSTER BUT MILES AWAY IN BRUSSELS BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WAS HOLDING AN EMERGENCY DEBATE ABOUT THE U.K.'S VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE UKIP LEADER AND NIGEL FARROW HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT HE HAS MADE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE THERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
BOOS AND WHISTLES FROM SOMMERS MISTER FARROW STOOD TO SPEAK BUT CLEARLY THERE ARE MIXED EMOTIONS HE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE YOUNG KIRKER HAD CHATTERED AND EVEN EMBRACED IN A VERY CONTINENTAL WAY BEFORE THE SESSION
NIGEL FARROW JUST A COUPLE OF FEET AWAY APPLAUDED AS MISTER YOUNG PER SAID BRITISH DEMOCRACY HAD TO BE RESPECTED BUT SWITCHING TO ENGLISH THAT'S WHY MY YONKERS PLEASANTRIES TOWARDS NIGEL FIN RAJ ENDED
THE LAST TIME YOU GOT APPLAUDING
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT YOU WERE HERE
FIGHTING FOR THE EXIT THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED IN FAVOUR THERE
IT WAS A SESSION OF RAW EMOTIONS MUCH OF IT DIRECTED AT MISTER FARRELL HAS THIS WAS THE GERMAN CENTRE RIGHT POLITICIAN MANFRED WEBER
SPREAD HATE IT OR USE ANY TO ALL THEY CAN FIND EVEN LIVES THE BURST LIARS CAN BE FOUND AMONG YOU
THE BELGIAN LIBERAL GAVE HER HALF START WENT IN EVEN HARDER WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR ME AND I THINK ALSO FOR THE OTHER GROUPS EITHER FOR EVERYBODY HERE IN THIS HOUSE IS THE WAY IT'S EXCEEDED THEIR ABSOLUTE NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN
THE POSTERS OF MY FATHER AS A SHOW THE WAY REFUGEES LIKE THE NAZI PROPAGANDA WE'VE GOT A COPY
THE S.N.P. IS ALAN SMITH SAID HE WAS PROUDLY EUROPEAN AND SCOTTISH SO PLEASE REMEMBER THIS SCOTLAND'S DID NOT LET YOU DOWN
PLEASE I BEG YOU DO NOT
HE GOT A STANDING OVATION FOR THAT BUT OTHER M.E.P.S TO CART FROM THE U.K.'S DECISION THE GERMAN LEFT WING POLITICIAN GABRIELLA SIMMER ARGUED THAT THE E.U. YOU HAD IGNORED WHAT ORDINARY PEOPLE WERE FEELING IT A KAVANA SEIZED BY THE E.U. CARAVAN ROLLS ON PLACEBOS WON'T HELP AT THE PATIENT IS VERY SERIOUSLY ILL I CAN'T
AND THE FRENCH RIGHT WING EMMY P. MARINE LE PEN CALLED THE REFERENDUM RESULT A SYMBOL OF LIBERTY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD A CRY OF LOVE OF A PEOPLE FOR THEIR COUNTRY THAT BURP BUSTLE
NIGEL FARAGE RESPONDED TO THE ATTACKS ON HIM IN KIND WITH A SMALL UNION JACK ON HIS DESK HE SAID THAT AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS HE HAD BEEN PROVED RIGHT ISN'T IT FUNNY YOU KNOW WHAT I CAME HERE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO
AND I SAID I WANTED TO LEAD A CAMPAIGN TO GET BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU ALL LAUGHED AT ME
I HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING NOW ARE YOU AND THE REASON YOU'RE SO UPSET
THE REASON YOU'RE SO ANGRY HAS BEEN PERFECTLY CLEAR
FROM ALL THE ANGRY EXCHANGES THIS MORNING YOU AS A POLITICAL PROJECT ARE IN DENIAL AND GETTING PERSONAL
VIRTUALLY NONE OF YOU HAVE EVER DONE A PROPER JOB IN YOUR LIVES
BARTY ARGUED WE COULD STILL TRADE AND STILL BE FRIENDS WE WILL TRADE WITH YOU WE WILL CO OPERATE WITH YOU WE WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD BUT I DO
DO IT SENSIBLY AND ALLOW US TO GO OFF AND PURSUE A GLOBAL AMBITIONS AND FUTURE BANK
AS THEY SAT DOWN TO BOOZE MISTER FARROW SMILED AND GAVE A SMALL CHUCKLE ON SOME LEVEL PERHAPS HE'LL MISS THEM A BIT AFTER ALL
SUSAN WHOM THERE REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HERE IN BRUSSELS YOU CAN HEAR MORE OF COURSE AT EIGHT THIRTY ON LONG WAVE OR ON DIGITAL TIME NOW'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST THIRTY MINUTES TO SEVEN I'M SORRY NOW THERE'S ONE THING THAT BUSINESSES DO NOT LIKE IT UNCERTAINTY AS ONE THING THAT BUSINESSES HAVE GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF NOW
UNCERTAINTY NONE MORE SO OF COURSE IN THE FIRMS OPERATING HERE IN BELGIUM AND PROMOTING TRADE BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE E. I'M JOINED BY GLENN VAUGHAN HE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN BELGIAN WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF THE FLAVOUR OF THE EMOTION IN THIS TOWN IN THAT IN THOSE EXTRACTS FROM YESTERDAY IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
AWKWARD IS IT EMOTIONALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BRITISH TRYING TO DO BUSINESS IN THIS TOWN BUT NICK
LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE LIKE THE PRINCE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR FRIENDS LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE SAD SOME ARE ANGRY AND YOU HEARD THAT EARLIER
WE HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT ACTUALLY WE ALL KNOW IN BUSINESS THAT FEELINGS MATTER MORE RELATIONSHIPS MATTER AND IS THERE A SENSE ALREADY THAT IF YOU'RE DEALING SAY WITH BRITS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OR ANOTHER REGULATORY BODIES HERE THERE'S ALREADY A SENSE OF WELL WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON ARE YOU A BRITON YOU LEAVING OR ARE YOU STILL REALLY PART OF THIS EUROPEAN PROJECT
YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CLEAR HERE
AT HOW THEY FELT AND IF I THINK ABOUT OUR MEMBERS THEY WERE ALMOST UNANIMOUS IN SAYING THEY WOULD LIKE US TO ME
THEY'RE SAYING THAT TO THEIR COLLEAGUES BUT THEN THEY'RE SAYING OH KATE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE TO GET ON WE HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE
AND MAKING THE BEST MEANS DOESN'T IT THAT YES UNCERTAINTY OF COURSE IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE REFERENDUM BUT IF I TALK TO YOU IN A WEEK OR TWO MAYBE A MONTH OR TWO WOULDN'T HAVE LEARNT TO LIVE WITH THAT AND YOU'LL GET ON WITH BUSINESS NO
UNCERTAINTY IS REAL IT HAS A REAL IMPACT ON BUSINESS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF OUR BUSINESS IS HERE RIGHT NOW IT MEANS INVESTMENT DECISIONS SHELF
THAT'S A REAL THING INVESTMENT DECISIONS SHELVED MEANS LESS JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WIN BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE
AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE EFFECT ON COSTS AND THE WHOLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN EVEN SELL OUR STUFF HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE A DEBATE HERE WHICH MANY PEOPLE FIND HARD TO FOLLOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET OR HAVING SOMETHING WHICH I THINK YOU THINK HE'S RATHER DIFFERENT MERELY FREE TRADE CAN YOU CUT THROUGH THE CONFUSION
FREE TRADE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IT MEANS I SELL MY STUFF TO YOU AND YOU DON'T PUT AN EXTRA TAX ON IT WHEN IT GETS TO THE CUSTOMER AND LIKEWISE
BEING IN THE SINGLE MARKET IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT'S A BUY OUT
WE'VE GOT THE SAME REGULATIONS AND RULES WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF I WANT TO DO BUSINESS HERE
I'VE ALREADY MEET ALL OF THE RULES I CAN MOVE MY PEOPLE THE PAPERWORK IS MUCH LESS I DON'T NEED IT DIFFERENT LICENCE TO OPERATE
ALL OF THIS STUFF ABOUT PASSPORT ING IS HOW CAN I OPERATE MY BUSINESS
ON THAT STRAIGHT AND EASY SO I DON'T WORK THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THESE WORDS MATTERS HUGELY FOR BUSINESS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE CLAIM OF ALL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN BELGIUM THANK YOU
IT'S NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN AN INQUIRY INTO THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC SERVICE TELEVISION PUBLISHES ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY IT WAS SET UP LAST YEAR AND HE'S REPORTING NOT LONG AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WHITE PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF THE B.B.C. LORD PUTTNAM CHAIR OF THE INQUIRY JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING BASICALLY IT'S A INQUIRY TOOK EIGHT MONTHS WE WENT ROUND THE COUNTRY AND TOOK A LOT OF THE PUBLIC SURROUNDINGS ARE LOOKING AT THE APPETITE THROUGH
PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING NOW AND THE WAY IN WHICH PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING CAN ENSURE A FUTURE IN A DIGITAL WORLD CONCLUSION ESSENTIALLY IS THAT PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE ITS
CREATION BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING IN AND ENVIRONMENT AND AND YOU WERE REPORTING ON IT EVERY SINGLE DAY WHERE THE EROSION OF TRUST HAS BECOME ALMOST ABSOLUTE AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS PUBLIC SO IT'S BROADCASTING SYSTEM
WHICH IS COMMITTED TO BEING ACCURATE TRUST TRUSTED BECOMES BUT FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF HAVING ANY SUSTAINABLE DEMOCRACY AND WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS THERE WOULD THERE HOW WOULD YOU ENVISAGE IT OPERATING DIFFERENTLY FROM HOW IT DOESN'T PRESENT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT OUR PROPOSALS IS TO DO WITH THE INDEPENDENCE THE B.B.C. AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE APPOINTMENTS ARE MADE TO THE B.B.C.'S NEW UNITARY BOUGHT WE SUPPORT THE BOARD WOULDN'T WELCOME IT BUT THE IDEA THAT IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT
WOULD BE COLOURED BY DECISIONS MADE BY GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS NOT A PART OF A LITTLE ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT ANY GOVERNMENT THIS IS ABOUT THE APPOINTMENT OF SOME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS BY THE GOVERNMENT WE THINK IT'S AND I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S CATASTROPHIC I THINK IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PUBLIC SERVICE INFORMATION SERVICE EFFECTIVELY WAS IT TRULY INDEPENDENT UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC TO INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT IT IS NOW AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT
AGAIN I SAY ANY GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAS IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM ABLE TO COLOUR THE NATURE OF THE BOARD IS HIS CATASTROPHIC AND YOU WOULD WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT
YOU STARTED WORK AT A TIME WHERE THE FEELING WAS THAT THE B. B. C. MIGHT BE UNDER ATTACK FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND AFTER THE WHITE PAPER CAME OUT OF ME YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT THE PRIDE THAT YOU THOUGHT THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR HAD SEEN OFF AN IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA DIDN'T DIDN'T THE THE NEW SETTLEMENT END UP MORE BENIGN THAN MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING YOU MIGHT HAVE FEARED I THINK NEW SETTLEMENT IS IN A SENSE MORE BENIGN BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S A WHITE PAPER
THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR WHO I THINK DID AN EXCELLENT JOB AND I WOULD VENICE I THINK SO DID THE DETECTIVE STAY PUT A D.C. MESS AT JOHN WAITING TILL THEY DID GOOD DO A GOOD JOB WE'RE IN A NEW TERRITORY NOW SHALL WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE PRIME MINISTER OR WHO THE CHANCELLOR OR INDEED TO THE INNOCENT DO YOU SEE M.S. WILL BE WE'LL ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE TROTTER SO IT'D GET ANOTHER REASON WHY
IT NEEDS TO BE ABSOLUTELY AT ARM'S LENGTH FROM THE GOVERNMENT OH K. AND THE OTHER PART WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING UP OFF THE B. B. C. CHANNEL FOUR YES SHALL WE COME UP VERY VERY CLEARLY THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT CHANNEL FOUR SHOULD NOT BE PRIVATISED THERE'S NO CASE FOR PRIVATISATION THERE'S NO SENSE OF MARKET FAILURE TELEPORT OUT OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL YEAR EVER HAD A VERY HAPPY SIX YEARS AS A BOARD MEMBER IT'S MORE SUCCESSFUL NOW THAN WHEN I LEFT THE BOAT MAY BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF THE BOARD I DON'T KNOW LORD PUTTNAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TURNER IS SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT HOW SHOULD UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS BEHAVE THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF A NEW RULE BOOK WHICH HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY THE COLLEGE OF POLICING FOLLOWING THE SCANDAL OF A STRING OF UNDERCOVER OFFICERS HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THOSE THEY WERE MEANT TO BE SPYING UPON
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ALEX MARSHALL CHIEF CONSTABLE OF THE COLLEGE OF POLICING WAS ON THE LINE FROM SALFORD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING RULE ONE PRESUME HE'S A RATHER SIMPLE ONE DON'T HAVE SEX WITH THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE INVESTIGATING THAT'S A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE IN THESE STANDARDS THAT ARE PUBLISHED FOR CONSULTATION TODAY IT'S NEVER ACCEPTABLE FOR AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER TO FORM AN INTIMATE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE THERE THEY'RE TARGETING OR THEY MEET WHILE CARRYING OUT THESE DUTY SO YES THERE IS A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT BUT I THINK
ALSO IMPORTANTLY WE NOW PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THE ROLLS THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE EXPECTATIONS IN THIS AREA SO THAT THIS IMPORTANT TACTIC WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CATCHING DANGEROUS AND SERIOUS CRIMINALS OVER THE YEARS IS NOT ABUSED AND THE PEOPLE WE SERVE CAN SEE WHAT THE RULES ARE
DOES THIS SIMPLY GUIDE AS TO WHAT YOU DO ONCE YOU'RE SPYING ON SOMEONE OR DOES IT TALK ABOUT WHO YOU SPY ON COS OFTEN THAT IS THE CONTROVERSY ISN'T IT GIVEN FOR EXAMPLE THE SPYING ON STEPHEN LAWRENCE'S FAMILY YEAH IN FACT IT COMES BACK FURTHER THAN THAT THESE THEY STANDARDS AND THIS GUIDANCE TALKS ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE SELECTED FOR THESE ROLES IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN THE TYPE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO UNDERGO AND TO THE POINT OF YOUR QUESTION
THE PERSON WHO AUTHORISES THIS UNDERCOVER DEPLOYMENT IS GOING TO BE A SENIOR OFFICER A CHIEF OFFICER IF IT GOES OVER A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A CHIEF CONSTABLE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED IN THIS AREA AND THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS THIS TACTIC SHOULD BE USED AGAINST SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CRIMINALS IT SHOULD NOT IN OTHER WORDS BE USED TO SPY ON FOR EXAMPLE STEPHEN LAWRENCE'S FAMILY OR FAMILY JUSTICE CAMPAIGNS LEFT WING M.P.S TREGINNIS IN THEIR LIFE
IT IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW THIS TACTIC SHOULD BE TARGETED IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT A RISK TO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF BEING SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CRIMINALS AND RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE OPERATION
BEFORE IT'S AUTHORISED WHEN IT'S DESIGNED WHO YOU SELECT FOR IT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS HAVE TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH EXPLAINED AND WRITTEN DOWN IS IT REALLY ABOUT GUIDELINES OR IS IT NOT ABOUT PROPER LEADERSHIP AND ENSURING THAT THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE KNOW WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THEIR NAME BY THEIR FORCE IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT THAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TERRIBLE FAILINGS IN THIS AREA AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S BEEN A LOSS OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE USE OF WHAT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL TACTIC IN OTHER WAYS IT IN CATCHING SERIOUS CRIMINALS BUT YOU CAN'T PUT ALL
THE BLAME ON THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT END YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY MANAGED HOW WERE THEY SELECTED WHO AUTHORISED THIS OPERATION AND WHO'S CHECKING IT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THAT'S WHAT THESE CONSULTATIONS STANDARD SET OUT TODAY IT EXPLAINS THE WHOLE CHAIN OF COMMAND IN UNDERCOVER IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PERSON AT THE FRONT END THEY DESERVE A LOT OF SUPPORT ACTUALLY BUT THERE ISN'T A NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT THEY DESERVE SUPPORT IN THIS HIGH RISK ROLE AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S THE WHOLE CHAIN OF COMMAND

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID BRITAIN WILL SEEK THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER IT LEAVES THAT HE WON'T E.U. LEADERS AND BRUSSELS THEY WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS ENTERED THE CONTEST TO BECOME THE NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND EX PRIME MINISTER
AND THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS HAVE KILLED AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE IN AN ATTACK ON THE MAIN AIRPORT IN ISTANBUL THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
DAVID CAMERON HAS WORN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT ONE OF ITS CENTRAL PRINCIPLES FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AS WELL AS IMMIGRATION AS IT WORKS OUT ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH BRITAIN SPEAKING AFTER AN E.U. SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT HE SAID THE TONE OF THE MEETING WAS ONE OF SADNESS AND REGRET THAT THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE HE SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO UNDUE PRESSURE TO INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY THE FORMAL NOTIFICATION OF LEAVING BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDIO
TOLD THE B. B. C. MISTER CAMERON SUCCESSOR WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO THAT SPEEDILY IF SOMEONE FROM UNDER MAIN CAMP WE'VE BECOME BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
THIS HAS TO BE DONE INTO BEAKS AFTER HIS APPOINTMENT IF THE NEXT BRITISH P.M. IS COMING FROM THE LIVE COMPARING IT SHOULD BE DONE TODAY AFTER HAS A POINT
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGULAR MERKEL'S SAID ALL THE LEADERS FELT THE E. U. WAS FACING A SEA CHANGE A WATERSHED MOMENT MISTER CAMERON SAID BRITAIN WANTED THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FUTURE A PROCESS THAT WOULD INVOLVE COMPROMISE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS BARRING EMERGENCIES DAVID CAMERON HAS NOW ATTENDED HIS LAST E.U. SUMMIT AND OVER DINNER LAST NIGHT HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING HE NEVER INTENDED TO DO TELL HIS FELLOW LEADERS THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE LEAVING THE E.U.
HIS COLLEAGUES ARE INSISTING THAT THERE CAN BE NO NEGOTIATION ON HER U.K. DEPARTURE BEFORE IT HAS FORMALLY INVOKED ARTICLE FIFTY AT THE LISBON TREATY BUT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE'D NOT BEEN PUT UNDER ANY PRESSURE I THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE READ AND SEE
A CLAMOUR FOR BRITAIN TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WITHOUT DELAY THAT WAS NOT THE MOOD OF THE MEETING THAT WAS NOT WHAT CLEAR MAJORITY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS SAID BUT OF COURSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE A CLEAR
MODEL UP HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT BRITAIN THINKS IS RIGHT FOR ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE BUT PATIENCE IS LIMITED YOU KNOWS THAT DELAY COULD DAMAGE THE REST OF THE UNION
AND THERE IS PLENTY OF SCOPE FOR OTHER DISAGREEMENTS DAVID CAMERON ARGUED THAT HE'D LOST THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE THE E.U. HAD FAILED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF FREE MOVEMENT AND IMMIGRATION
BUT DONALD TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL SAID THE E.U. HAD TO DEFEND ITS VALUES WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALSO REASON
FOLD THIS IN THE U.K. THE MIGRATION THEN TELL A MIGRATION IN EUROPE BUT EVITA HAD THAT THE SISTER TO COME
MAINE METAL TO THE VALUE OF FREE MOVEMENT IT'S AND AND SHANGO I'M OFFERED THEM SURE THAT THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF
THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN E.U. LEADERS WILL GATHER THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE WITHOUT THE U.K. AT THE TABLE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS BUT THIS IS AS BIG A CHALLENGE FOR THE E.U. AS IT IS FOR THE U.K. THERE WILL BE CALLED FOR UNITY AND FOR REFORM PROMISES WILL NEED TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE QUICKLY BECAUSE THE U.K. REFERENDUM HAS SHAKEN EUROPE TO THE CORE
NOMINATIONS OPEN TODAY IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL STAND ON A JOINT TICKET WITH THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SURGIT JAVID BORIS JOHNSON AND THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY WILL ALSO ENTER THE RACE BEFORE NOMINATIONS CLOSE TOMORROW HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON

WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH STEPHEN CRABB PROMISES TO LEAD WHAT HE CALLS A ONE NATION GOVERNMENT A MODERN COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK HE SAYS
MY CRAB YOU CAMPAIGN FOR HER REMAIN VOTE SAYS A SECOND REFERENDUM IS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS A RED LINE IT IS INSTEAD HE ARGUES TIME TO CRAFT AN IMMIGRATION POLICY BUT HIS OUTWARD LOOKING ENSURES WE GET THE SKILLS WE NEED AND IS ULTIMATELY DECIDED IN THE U.K.

AND IF WE LOSE ELECTIONS THEN THE PRICE OF FAILURE IS PAID BY THE WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO DO NOT HAVE A GOVERNMENT TO STAND UP FOR THEM I BELIEVE THAT WE DO NEED A LABOUR LEADER WHO CAN LEAD US TO BE A CREDIBLE OPPOSITION LOOK LIKE A GOVERNMENT IN WAITING AND REACH OUT TO THE VOTERS THAT WE HAVE LOST
SPEAKING ON THE SAME PROGRAMME THE NEWLY APPOINTED SHADOW ENERGY SECRETARY BARRY GARDNER SAID M.P.S WERE USING A BACKDOOR MANOEUVRE TO UNDERMINE MY HE HAS NEVER HAD THE CONFIDENCE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF LABOUR M.P.S I DIDN'T VOTE FOR I DON'T PAINT I DIDN'T NOMINATE HIM BUT
THE PARTY CHOSE IN ITS WISDOM
TO HAVE HIM AS ITS LEADER WE MUST WORK WITH THAT AND THEN USE THE RULES THAT THE PARTY HAS SET TO CHANGE THE LEADER IF WE DON'T LIKE
AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A GUN AND BOMB ATTACK ON ISTANBUL'S ATATURK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OTHERS WERE WOUNDED WHEN THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS OPENED FIRE WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BEFORE BLOWING THEMSELVES UP AT A SECURITY CHECKPOINT A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT MARK OWEN HAD JUST LANDED AT THE AIRPORT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT STRUCK
IT WAS A BRAZEN ATTACK ON EUROPE'S THIRD BUSIEST AIRPORT EMERGENCY SERVICES RUSHING TO THE INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL AT ISTANBUL ATATURK AFTER THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS OPENED FIRE AND THEN BLEW THEMSELVES
DOZENS WERE KILLED AND MANY MORE INJURED BY THE GUNMEN WHO ARRIVED IN TAXIS BEFORE LAUNCHING THEIR COORDINATED ATTACK
PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING I WAS SAD WE ALL ROUND THE OTHER WAY
AND THEN THEIR ADVANCE IT OFF OR NOT PAUL IS IT ISN'T IT HOW DO YOU PULL IS THERE OR NOT THEY WERE SHOOTING AT THE POLICE AND THE POLICE WERE SHOOTING AT THEM SOMEONE NEXT TO A SCOT SHOT MIKE THEN WE SAW THE BOMB IN THE X. RAY MACHINE EXPLODE EVERYBODY AROUND IT DIED IN THAT BLAST THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER VISITED THE SCENE HAD SAID SIGNS POINT TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP TURKEY HAS SEEN A WAVE OF BOMBINGS OVER THE PAST YEAR BOTH BY I S. AND KURDISH MILITANTS SINCE THE CEASEFIRE WITH THE P.K.K. BROKE DOWN
CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT TALK OF SECURITY LAPSES AND POLICY FAILURES THAT HAVE ALLOWED CELLS TO GROW WITHIN TURKEY THE GOVERNMENT DENIES THE CHARGE ATATURK AIRPORT HAS LONG SEEMED A SOFT TARGET FEW VEHICLES ARE CHECKED DRIVING IN THEIR SCANNERS ARE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TERMINAL
THE BOMBERS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR EASY APPROACH AND STRUCK WITH DEVASTATING IMPACT
A RULE BOOK COVERING THE CONDUCT OF UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DRAFT GUIDANCE BANDS SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND SAYS OFFICERS MUST SUBMIT TO REGULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING
THE GUITAR IT'S SCOTTY MOORE WHO PLAYED ON THE RECORDINGS THAT KICKSTARTED ELVIS PRESLEY'S CAREER HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR MORE ON THE BASIS BILL BLACK ACCOMPANIED PRESLEY AT THE SESSIONS AT SUN STUDIOS IN MEMPHIS THAT PRODUCED HIS FIRST HIT THAT'S ALL RIGHT IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR I WAS SHEENA
THE SONG WAS REGARDED BY SOME AS THE FIRST ROCK'N'ROLL RECORD BLENDING BLUES GOSPEL AND COUNTRY MORE ALSO PLAYED ON HITS SUCH AS HEARTBREAK HOTEL AND HOUND DOG AND APPEARED ON PRISON IS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT TELEVISION COMEBACK CONCERT
THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ATATURK AIRPORT IN ISTANBUL IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BUSIEST THE SUICIDE BOMBERS THAT STRUCK AT YESTERDAY ARRIVED AT THE DEPARTURES HALL BY TAXI AND OPEN FIRE LATER BLOWING THEMSELVES UP THIRTY SIX PEOPLE WERE KILLED ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INJURED THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IS RESPONSIBLE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE B.B.C.'S HUGH SYKES AND HUGH YOU WERE AT THE AIRPORT AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK
I WILL BE SURE YES GOOD MORNING I WAS JUST LANDED ON A FLIGHT FROM LONDON WHICH IS THEN NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN ITS DOORS FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU GOT OUT
WHAT I SAW AND HEARD THAT WE TELL YOU WHAT THE DETAILS ARE THE LATEST NEWS IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THREE PEOPLE STARTED SHOOTING OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE
TO THE INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL AT ATATURK AIRPORT HERE IN ISTANBUL POLICE THEN SHOT BACK AT THEM AND THEY DETONATED THEIR SUICIDE BURSTS AND THE VIVID VIDEO FOOTAGE GOING AROUND NOW
FILMED ON MOBILE PHONES THE TWO EXPLOSIONS IN QUITE QUICK SUCCESSION
AND I RECORDED THIS DESCRIPTION AS I WALKED OUT OF THE AIRPORT
AFTER PASSPORT CONTROL WAS SORT OF GOING DOWN THE SLOPE CONFIDENTLY DRAWS THE BAGGAGE CAROUSEL
THERE ARE SCREENINGS OF EMPEROR BUT THERE ARE GAPS BETWEEN THE SCREE
LOOKING THROUGH THE GAPS YOU CAN SEE
SECONDS OF FEELING FORMAL TO THE GROUND
HUGE PANES OF PLATE GLASS PARTLY SHATTERED AND BLOOD ON THE GROUND
THIS THEME CONTINUES FOR QUITE A FEW METRES
FOR YOU EMERGE INTO THE DOMESTIC TERMINAL DISASTER
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS ATTACK LAST NIGHT DISASTER FOR TERRY
CYNICAL TIMING BY WHOEVER DID THAT
TO HAVE MAXIMUM IMPACT
AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TURKISH SUMMER TOURISTS
THE SECURITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSIVE GOING INTO THE TERMINALS HERE WHO CAN'T GET INTO THE MAIN TERMINALS THEMSELVES WITHOUT PUSHING YOUR LUGGAGE THROUGH A SCANNER IT'S NOT LIKE GATWICK OR HEATHROW LONDON CITY AIRPORT
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR BAGS OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE RIGHT INSIDE THE AIRPORT HERE VERSUS SECURITY SCANNERS RIGHT BY THE ENTRANCE
THE TWO MAIN TERMINALS AND THAT'S WHERE THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE THE EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE VERY CLOSE TO THOSE SECURITY SCANNERS SO IN A SENSE THEY WORK BUT CHECKPOINTS AND SECURITY SCANNERS ARE ALSO TARGET
BECAUSE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE GATHER AROUND THEM AND THE SECURITY STAFF WERE OPERATING
ARE IN GREAT DANGER FOR ANYBODY MEANING THEM HARM WITH A BOMB WHICH IS WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED HERE IN ISTANBUL LAST NIGHT
THE AIRPORT OBVIOUSLY CLOSED THIS MORNING DEBRIS THE BLOOD IS BEING REMOVED AND THE COLLAPSED CEILING PANELS AND
BROKEN LIGHT FITTINGS HANGING DOWN FROM THE CEILING OF BEING REMOVED AND SECURED AND I THINK THE FOCUS TODAY WILL BE
THE FIRST STAGE OF THE SECURITY CHECK YOU WHICH THERE IS AT THE AIRPORT IS OF A MOTOR A CHECKPOINT CHECKPOINT FOR VEHICLES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SECURITY CHECKED AS THEY'RE GOING INTO THE AIRPORT IT'S FITTED WITH INEVITABLY C.C.T.V. CAMERAS WHICH CAN REPORT NUMBER PLATES BUT THAT THAT'S NOT MUCH USE IF YOU'VE GOT SUICIDE BOMBERS
MEN WITH KALASHNIKOVS COMING IN IN A TAXI AS IT SEEMED LAST NIGHT AN INTERN
ATTACK WITH WITHIN I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS AIRPORT MANY MANY TIMES AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH ANECDOTAL I KNOW BUT I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN ANY VEHICLE BEING CHECKED ON THE WAY IN TO ATATURK AIRPORT AND HUGH IN A BROADER QUESTIONS TOO ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE TURKEY GIVEN THAT WE'VE HAD SO MANY ATTACKS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF REASON
YES THIS ONE IS IT BEING THOUGHT NOBODY'S ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN YET WHO DID IT BUT IT'S
THE OFFICIAL VIEW HERE IS THAT IT'S ISLAMIC STATE DIRE ASH AS IT'S CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THERE'S BEEN A STRING OF OVERTAX BORROWED THEM AND ALSO BY THE P.K.K.
TURKISH INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT A STRING OF ATTACKS IN ANKARA AND IN TURKEY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE KILLED IN ONE ATTACK HIM IN ANKARA
LAST YEAR THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE KILLED IN MY GROUP THIS YEAR A SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN ISTANBUL THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR SO
IT DID IT AS A SAID IT'S INCREDIBLY BAD BAD NEWS OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED DESPERATELY SAD FOR THE RELATIVES OF THE DEAD AND
HUGELY WOUNDING TO THE TOURIST INDUSTRY
TURKEY MASSIVELY RELIES ON YOU SYKES IN ISTANBUL THANK YOU
IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN HE'S AT THE BEGINNING COULD OTHERS FOLLOW HAS BRITAIN DECIDED TO DESERT A CLUB WHICH IS NOW SET TO DISINTEGRATE ALL HAS THE PUNISHMENT METED OUT BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. MIGHT BE
AND THE TOUGH RESPONSE OF A SOON TO BE FORMER ALLIES ENSURED THAT THE EUROPEAN CLUB WILL HOLD TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF YET ANOTHER CRISIS I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC HERE IN BRUSSELS OR STOPPED IT JOINING ME IN THE STUDIO BY MARIO MONTI THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY AND A FORMER E.U. COMMISSIONER AS WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU MY
THERE IS A SENSE HERE IN THIS CITY ISN'T THERE THAT THE E.U. NEEDS BRITAIN TO BE SEEN TO SUFFER SO NO ONE ELSE DARES TO ASK FOR THE SORT OF CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP THAT BRITAIN WANTED
ITALY DERMOT PLANTS TO PROMOTE IT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RICHES BOOTH A RETREAT YOU SHOULDN'T HORROR CRIME UP EFFECT IT'S IN PRETTY BAD SO NUMBER ONE THE U.K. ALREADY AT ALL ON CRIPPLE ACHIEVER INDEED THAT IS NEW CONDITIONS FOR CONTINUING TO BELONGS TO YOU AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIXTY YEARS THE OTHER MEMBER SPEAKS A AGREE
THE RED SIGNAL BUT NOW LEAVE THEM HE'S OUT ALTHOUGH A SAMBA AND OF COURSE AND THEY REALISE BRITISH CITIZENS REALISED WAR WAS NOT BROKEN UP SO THEY ARE POTENTIAL NEW OR IN REALLY HOW PROBLEMATIC AND CRYSTAL ARE MUDDY
O.K. LET'S DO A WEEK LAST WEEK DID NOT HAPPEN BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE
BETWEEN EACH REMEMBER SPEED AND THERE YOU'LL BE IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK AND HOPE BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PUB
YOU'VE GOT AS I USE I STRONGLY HOPED THAT THERE WILL
BUT OF COURSE RIGOUROUS NICHOLAS'S SHONE NOT TO FURTHER ALL BECAUSE OF THE NEEDS OF THE BRITISH THE MOST IT IS THAT THE WHOLE FABRIC
BUT
LET ME EXPLORE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IN TERMS OF NOT UNDOING THOSE PRINCIPLES THEN BORIS JOHNSON THE LEADING LEAVE CAMPAIGNER SAYS WE WANT SOMETHING VERY VERY SIMPLE WE WANT ACCESS AN IMPORTANT WORD ACCESS TO THE E.U. SINGLE MARKET PLUS A LIMIT TO THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IS SUCH A DEAL IN YOUR VIEW EVER POSSIBLE NO BLUNTLY NO
ONE KILO OF THE WITCHES THE SINGLE MARKET BY THE WAY BELOW THEIR CLAWS ON
ITS CONSTRUCTION AND UM HE WAS NOT SO GOOD AT
ISN'T THE PROBLEM HERE THOUGH AND SOME BRITISH VOTERS MANY VOTED LEAVE WILL SAY YOU DON'T GET IT EUROPE'S LEADERS DON'T GET IT THE ANGER THAT IS FELT AMONGST MANY IN BRITAIN TOWARDS THE VIEW IS SHARED BY MANY VOTERS RIGHT ACROSS THE CONTINENT IF YOU SIMPLY SAY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PRINCIPLES LIKE THEM OR LUMP THEM YOU WILL FIND REBELLIONS IN COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY
WHY WAS HE SO YOU HAVE A COUNTRY WHERE UP TO SEE IT FOR A LAUGH I'M SURE HE'S STORY CHLOE AND OR NOT BECAUSE IT AND PULL IT
COULD BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT LET'S CALL IT PRINCIPLE OR OR LIKE COME ON COME ON AND EVEN POM HELP POLICE TOGETHER IS THAT IT ALL MEMBER STATES SHOULD BE TREATED EQUAL
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GREAT BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY PRETTY MARIO MONTI THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND GOOD LUCK IN THE BRUSSELS TRAFFIC NIGHTIE IT'S PAST SEVEN
HIGH STREET CHAIN DIXONS COFFIN IS ONE OF THE FIRST BIG COMPANIES TO REPORT ANNUAL RESULTS AFTER THE BRICKS EFFECT DOMINIC'S BACK WITH MORE ON THAT THANKS MY SHOT IN A DECENT SAID RESULTS THEY ARE SALES UP FIVE PER CENT PROFIT UP SEVENTEEN PERCENT WITH ME TO HAVE A CHAT ABOUT THEM AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE SLIPS IT JAMES SAID THESE ARE VERY GOOD RESULTS BUT OF COURSE IT ALL HAPPENED BEFORE THE BIG EVENT BEFORE THE BRICKS HAD VOTE YES WHAT'S HAPPENED SIR
SINCE IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF HIS PRETTY EARLY DAYS WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN TRADE PRETTY MUCH CONTINUE AS BEFORE WITH SAILS UP I THINK THAT MOST CUSTOMERS ARE CARRYING ON WITH THEIR LIVES I THINK WE GET VERY TIED UP IN IN A IN A IN A WORLDS AND I THINKING THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY ARE BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY THEY'RE JUST CARRYING ON DOING WHAT THEY WERE DOING BEFORE COS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SURVEYS OUT HEAVEN IS SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE WILL PUT MORE MONEY INTO SAVING STOP SPINNING ON LITERAL GOODS AND HOME IMPROVEMENTS
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET NOT SO FAR I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC I THINK FOR OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE FOR A CUPPA REASONS FIRSTLY AS YOU SAY WE'VE COME OUT OF A RECORD WHICH WE MADE RECORD PROFITS WE HAVE A VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND FORTUNE TENDS TO FAVOUR THE BOTH THE BRAVE AND THE STRONG AND I THINK WITH BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AND SECONDLY WE'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD TRACK RECORD OF DEALING WITH TURBULENT TIMES BOTH IN THE U.K. A FEW YEARS AGO AND INCREASED LAST YEAR WHERE WE EMERGE FROM THOSE WITH HIGH MARKET SHARE AND
AND BETTER PROFITABILITY SO UH A FOR OUR BUSINESS I THINK WE ARE WE'RE IN AS GOOD A SHAPE AS WE CAN BE TWO TWO AS WE GO INTO THIS THE MORE DIFFICULT TIME YOU HAVE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT EUROPE HAVE JUST HAD MARIO MONTI BEER TALKING ABOUT HOW BRITAIN CAN'T EXPECT TO HAVE FREE ACCESS TO THE MARKETS FOR NO PRICE AT ALL ARE YOU EXPECTING SOME DISRUPTION TO OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF WHAT
FOLLOWS ON FROM THE BRICKS AT VOTE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE LOTS OF LOTS OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING AND I THINK MARK MIGHT MY MESSAGE SENT TO MY TEAMS IS THAT WE NEED TO ABSOLUTELY DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LEADERS GET ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAL THE RIFTS THAT THIS DEBATE HAS CAUSED IN OUR SOCIETY AND I THINK WE JUST NEED TO KEEP OUR PECKERS UP AND CARRY ON DOING WHAT WE DO ARE YOU ARE YOU LOOKING TO OFFLOAD LOTS OF RED TAPE AND THE BRICKS IT TEARS ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT FREEDOM OF BUSINESS FROM
FROM BRUSSELS BUT LOADS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT WE HAVE WE'VE VOTED TO LEAVE WE'LL HAVE TO SEE I MEAN I MIGHT MIGHT MY FEELING IS THAT AS A BUSINESS AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERY BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRY WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO REACT QUITE A LOT FASTER THAN OUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND WE WILL WE WILL SEE WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE WIRE AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO TURN THAT TO OUR ADVANTAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN USE ANY FREEDOMS THAT WE GET TO OFFER BETTER DEALS TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT SORT OF WHAT WE'RE PAID TO DO

THERE'S LIFE IN THE HIGH STREET YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH SID JAMES CHIEF OF DIXONS CARPHONE
DOMINIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE MEETS IMMOVABLE OBJECT WELCOME TO THE LABOUR PARTY NO LEADER IN POLITICAL HISTORY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE A REVOLT ON THE SCALE OF THE ONE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE INSIDE THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY BUT NO LEADER IN POLITICAL HISTORY HAS BEEN WILLING TO SIMPLY IGNORE THE VIEWS OF HIS CLOSEST COLLEAGUES
ON THE GROUNDS THAT WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE VIEWS OF THE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE PARTY MEMBERS WHO ELECTED HIM FAIRLY RECENTLY SO WHAT OR WHO WILL NOW GIVE JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE FORMER LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY THE M.P. FOR DERBY SOUTH DAME MARGARET BECKETT GOOD MORNING TO YOU
IF YOUR SUCCESSOR OF JEREMY CORBIN INVITED YOU IN FOR A PRIVATE ONE TO ONE WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HIM
TELL HIM THAT IT IS AN EXTREME THIS IS THE WORST JOB IN POLITICS AND BEING THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IS WORSE IT'S STILL
AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESSURES ARE HORRENDOUS AND IT CAN MAKE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES THAT ARE HARD TO OVERCOME BUT THAT
WHEN HE WAS SOON LEADERSHIP YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE INTERESTS OF THOSE YOU DEED COME BEFORE YOUR OWN AND IN THOSE INTERESTS I'M AFRAID HE SHOULD STAND ASIDE YOU'VE GOT TO GO I FEAR SO I MEAN YESTERDAY I FOUND IT
MUCH OF THE TIME THAT THE BALLET CAME I HAD SOUGHT OF STEELED MYSELF TO THE SUB BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAD TO VOTE FOR HER BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS JEREMY'S THERE NICE
LABEL IT AND I HAVE NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I IMAGINE THAT I WOULD BE CASTING A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WITH THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS AND APPROACH THIS IS LIKE A FAMILY TRAUMA I SENSE WHAT IT IS PINGING OFF THE LEAD PUTTING THERE'S A FAMILY AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT IT IS
AND YET THEY'RE MAYBE PARTY ACTIVISTS PARTY MEMBERS LISTENING AND SAYING WHAT DON'T DO IT BUT WE'VE ONLY JUST VOTED FOR HIM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF US STILL LOVE HIM AND ADMIRE HIM AND WANT HIM TO CARRY ON SO WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE MARGARET BECKETT INSISTING HE HAS TO GO
I'D SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT YES OF COURSE THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ADMIRE
MANY FINE QUALITIES THAT JEREMY HARRIS AND NO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY PRETTY MUCH IS QUARRELLING WITH THAT
AND EVERYBODY WOULD WANT PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW HE'S GOT INTEGRITY AND DECENCY AND SO ON AND THAT'S TRUE AND THEY ARE THOSE ARE QUALITIES YOU MIGHT HOPE TO FIND IN A LEADER BUT THEY DON'T LOVE THEMSELVES MAKE YOU AT THE
I'M VERY SORRY TO SAY THAT PEOPLE RIGHT ACROSS THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY I WE ALL KNOW
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE NEVER RECONCILED TO JEREMY IS BEING ELECTED LEADER LET'S PUT THAT ON ONE SIDE
IN MY VIEW OF THE BULK OF THE LABOUR PARTY TOOK THE VIEW IT WAS GOING TO BE VERY ROCKY ROAD BECAUSE JEREMY HAS NO EXPERIENCE ISN'T IT'S NOT HER FAULT IT'S JUST A FACT HE HAS NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL ON THE PROBLEMS OF LEADERSHIP OR OF BEING ON THE FRONT BENCH
THAT'S ALL THE SCRUTINY FROM YOUR PROFESSION THE COMPROMISES THAT YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T PRECISELY SHARE YOUR POINT OF VIEW TO GET TO THE BEST COMMON GROUND THAT'S THAT'S HAD A WORLD THAT WAS BEYOND HIM
UNTIL HE WAS ELECTED LEADER AND PEOPLE WERE WILLING AND VERY WILLING TO TRY AND HELP AND SUPPORT HIM THROUGH THAT IN TO SEE IF HE COULD HAVE THE SAME MAGIC EFFECT ON ME
ELECTORATE AS HE HAD ON THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY BUT YOUR CLOCK LUCIAN I THINK IZZY'S TRIED AND HE'S FAILED AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ANGER IS THERE NOT THAT THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DO NOT GIVE YOU THE ACCESS AS LABOUR M.P.S YOU MIGHT WANT TO NOT AND DID NOT DO WHAT YOU WANTED IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IT'S THE BIGGEST CLICHE IN POLITICS BUT ONE OF THEM
WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO CRITICISE A LEADER THEY SAY WELL I'M AT THE LEADER'S OFFICE ISN'T DOING THINGS RIGHT BUT ACTUALLY
I'M AFRAID THE PEOPLE IN THERE AND THE LEADER'S OFFICE ACTS LIKE A SEPARATE UNIT FROM THE LABOUR PARTY AND ONE OF THE MOST TELLING THINGS ABOUT YESTERDAY WHAT I WOULD URGE PARTY MEMBERS TO TO OBSERVE AND TAKE HEED OF IS THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT JEREMY'S DONE
POLICY WAS MORE OPEN AREN'T UNDER ED MILLIBAND AND JEREMY HAS EXTENDED THAT STILL FURTHER POLICY MAKING AND JEREMY HAS BROUGHT ON A WHOLE NEW RAFT OF TALENT PARTLY BECAUSE
SOME MORE EXPERIENCE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY HE HAS BROUGHT ON NEW OR PEOPLE WHO HAD MORE LIMITED EXPERIENCE INTO THE SHADOW CABINET AND THEY HAVE GONE
AND THAT'S NOT COS THERE WAS A COUP OR A PLOT THEY'VE GONE BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY COULD NO LONGER DEAL WITH THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD MARGARET BECKETT THERE ARE SOME FROM OUTSIDE WHO WONDER WHETHER YOUR PARTY NOW HAS A DEATH WISH
NO AND IT'S BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PART OF WHAT CAME OUT OF THE TURBULENCE OF THE LAST DAY OR SO IS A REALISATION THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND JEREMY WHO ARE PREPARED TO SEE THE LABOUR PARTY SPLIT
RATHER THAN FOR HIM TO GO AND THAT IS A NAFF
EVERYBODY WHO THINKS THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS GOVERNMENT AND THE DAMAGE THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY FURTHER DAMAGE THAT HER RIGHT EVEN MORE RIGHT WING TORY GOVERNMENT WOULD DO
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT URGENT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER IT HAS TO SURVIVE BECAUSE IT WE HAVE ANY RIGHT TO EXIST AS A PARTY BUT BECAUSE THE NATION NEEDS A STRONG OPPOSITION AND WE NEED AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNMENT MARGARET BECKETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US

THANK YOU CHRIS IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO EAT IF YOU'RE GOING GO GET ON WITH IT STOP HANGING AROUND THAT'S BEEN A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER WHO LAYS THE IDEA THAT THE REST OF THE E.U. HAS TO WAIT WHAT'S THE TORY PARTY CHOOSES A NEW LEADER AND WHOEVER THAT MIGHT BE THEN DECIDES WHEN AND HOW TO FORMALLY QUIT THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU LEADERS HAVE STARTED TO ARRIVE FOR THEIR SECOND DAY OF THEIR SUMMIT HERE IN BRUSSELS THIS MORNING BUT THERE IS NO
BRITISH REPRESENTATIVE DAVID CAMERON FLEW HOME LAST NIGHT IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN THIS ORGANISATION'S HISTORY BUT THE SUMMIT HAS GONE AHEAD WITH ONE MEMBER NOT PRESENT WHY BECAUSE OF COURSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN THIS ORGANISATION'S HISTORY THAT A COUNTRY HAS CHOSEN TO LEAVE
I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO ONE OF MISTER YONKERS COLLEAGUES THE COMPETITION COMMISSIONER MARGARET A VEST TIGGER A DANISH POLITICIAN WHO WAS THE MODEL FOR BIRD GITA THE FICTIONAL PRIME MINISTER IN THE DRAMA BORG
PEOPLE I'M VERY VERY SAD AND SO I MIGHT BE SAD BECAUSE OF A FRENCH SHIPS BEING BROKEN OR SAD BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES HERE AND AND FEEL REJECTED
AS IF THEY WEREN'T SERVING OR SO THE CITIZENS OF GREAT BRITAIN THERE IS A SUSPICION FROM SOME AT HOME THAT EUROPEANS WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GET RID BRITAIN ALWAYS COMPLAINING ALWAYS WANTING THE RULES CHANGE SPECIALLY FOR THE
OH NO ON THE CONTRARY BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THE SLOGAN THAT WE ARE UNITED IN THEIR IN DIVERSITY IT HAS A REAL BITE
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT FIND GOOD THINGS IF EVERYONE AGREE IN THE OUTSET IF THERE IS NO ONE COMING WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE SOMETIMES BEING STUBBORN SOMETIMES BEING CONSTRUCTIVE BUT BRINGING SOMETHING ELSE TO THE TABLE
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WILL BE GREATLY MISSED AND YET THE HEAD OF THE COMMISSION MISTER YOUNGER HE'S BANGING THE TABLE AND SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO YOU BETTER GET GOING AND GO QUICKLY WHY THE IMPATIENCE WHY NOT MORE UNDERSTANDING
I THINK I THINK ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS BUT THE THING IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF THE EUROPEANS AND THE LONGER IT TAKES THE BIGGER IT IS THE UNCERTAINTY
AND YOU HAD THIS TO SAY OH I HAD PLANNED THIS INVESTMENT BUT I WILL WAIT AND SEE I HAD PLANNED TO HIRED TWO OR FIVE MORE PEOPLE BUT I'LL JUST WAIT AND SEE
ACTUALLY I WOULD HAVE DOUBLED UP ON MY APPRENTICESHIP BUT LET'S JUST PUT IT IN THE BOX AGAIN NOW YOU MAY WANT THIS TO BE RESOLVED QUICKLY BUT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO IF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO GO SLOW IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO FILE FOR DIVORCE NOT TO USE THIS ARTICLE FIFTY IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO FORCE IT
NO OBVIOUSLY THE INITIATIVE IS THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HERE AND THE TALK NOW IS OF WHAT THE NEW DEAL MIGHT BE BETWEEN THE U.K.
AND THE YOU KNOW BORIS JOHNSON WHO LED TO LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAYS HE WANTS FOR ACCESS TO THE SIGNAL MARKET BUT HE WANTS LIMITS TO THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE TO SUCH A DEAL EXIST
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND ANYONE WHO HAS HAD STUDIO BECAUSE THE SINGLE MARKET COMES WITH WITH THEIR BASIC FREEDOMS
MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL GOODS AND SERVICES AND PEOPLE
YOU CAN WORK IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY IT IS IT IS SO INTO TWINNED WHAT WE DO HERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE MARKET OF CAPITAL AND SERVICES AND GOETZ IT'S ALSO A MARKET WHICH IS REGULATED TO SERVE THE CITY SENT IN EUROPE BUT THIS WAS AN IDEA DREAMT UP LONG BEFORE PEOPLE
YOU ALL COULD AFFORD TO SIMPLY MOVE AT THE DROP OF A HAT FOR A FEW POUNDS OR A FEW KRONER A FEW EURO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY THIS WAS DREAMT OF IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE MASS MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES SO MAYBE IT NEEDS THINKING THROUGH AGAIN
BUT ACTUALLY WE THINK A LOT ABOUT IT AND WE TAKE A VERY SET A VERY SERIOUS IT'S MY INTERESTS AND MY COLLEAGUE WHO S. A PRIME RESPONSIBILITY BUT IT'S NOT EVEN FIVE PER CENT
OF EUROPEANS WHO WORK IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR CITIZENSHIP
OF COURSE A MOVE FOR EDUCATION OR BECAUSE THEY'RE RETIRED BUT WHEN IT COMES TO WORK IN ANOTHER COUNTRY IT'S LESS THAN FIVE PER CENT THERE'S MUCH TALK ABOUT WHAT BRITAIN SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS REFERENDUM WHAT SHOULD EUROPE LEARNED IS IT NOT A WAKE UP CALL TO EUROPE AS A WHOLE AND TO THIS CITY IN PARTICULAR IN THE BUREAUCRACY BASED HERE BUT I THINK THAT THE CLOCK HAS BEEN RINGING FOR QUITE SOME TIME
MAYBE THE SNOOZE BUTTON WOODS WAS HIT FOR FIRST SOME YES BUT WHAT I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH WORKING HERE IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SLIM DOWN THINGS TO FOCUS AND SOMETHING THAT CAN SHOULD BE DONE IN THE EUROPEAN PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THEN LEAVE
A NUMBER OF THINGS FOR FOUR MEMBER STATES BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE AS WELL OR EVEN BETTER IN MEMBER STATES PARLIAMENT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW ARGUE WITH US THAT WE SHOULD LEGISLATE MORE BECAUSE THEY FIND THAT THEY HAD TOO LITTLE TO DO
DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT BRITAIN IS NOW OUT IN OTHER WORDS IN THIS CITY DID PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT
FORGET THE REFERENDUM THE DANES VOTED AGAINST MAASTRICHT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HE DID IT AGAIN THE FRENCH BOASTED AGAINST A TREATY THEY DID IT AGAIN MAYBE THE BRITS WILL SIMPLY CHANGE THEIR MINDS
BUT THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IT WAS OF COURSE THE TREATY OF LISBON FOR SEES THAT ARE MEMBERS THEY MAY LEAVE BUT HE HAS NOT HAPPENED BEFORE
THERE'S A VERY UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT AND THAT THE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE SO SAD IS THAT THEY THINK IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN THAT THE U.K.'S GOING TO LEAVE BUT
BRITAIN WERE TO RETHINK WHAT THEY GET A HEARING IN BRUSSELS OR AS BRUSSELS ALREADY DECIDED YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE WE GAVE YOU A DEAL YOU REJECTED IT YOU WANT OUT I'M SORRY NOW I HAVE TO GO AND YOU HAVE TO GO AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS WAS NEVER THIS WAS NEVER IN ANY EUROPEAN UNION THING
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL THE TIME PLEASE STAY
CAN WE MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU WHERE WE FEEL AT HOME AS WELL YES PLEASE STAY THIS IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT US THIS IS ABOUT THE U.K.
COMMISSIONER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT WAS A PLEASURE TALKING TO YOU THANK YOU
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND MOST OF THEM LEAD ON DAVID CAMERON'S ANALYSIS OF WHY BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS THE HEADLINE KAMRAN BLAMES BREAKFAST DEFEAT ON E.U. FAILURE TO TACKLE IMMIGRATION THE PAPER SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD EUROPEAN LEADERS IN BRUSSELS THAT HE LOST THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO ADDRESS PUBLIC CONCERNS OVER IMMIGRATION THE SUN HAS THE HEADLINE NOW HE GETS IT
SPELT EXCI T. AT THE END IT SAYS MISTER CAMERON LAID OUT HIS THINKING OVER DINNER TELLING E.U. LEADERS HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE THE TIME SAYS HE GAVE AN ULTIMATUM IF YOU WANT A FUTURE DEAL WITH BRITAIN ON THE SINGLE MARKET REFORM FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT RULES
COLUMNIST CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE WHAT NOW QUESTION AND WE COME TO VERY DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS MATTHEW NORMAN IN THE IBEX THE CALL FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM MADE IN A PETITION SIGNED BY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE HE SAYS IF HE EVEN THE LIKES OF THE SUN COLUMNIST KELVIN MACKENZIE AND DOUBTING THEIR VOTE TO LEAVE HOW MANY LESS SELF RIGHTEOUS OTHERS HAVE PRIVATELY CONCLUDED THE SAME
BUT GEORGE WON'T BE ON THE GUARDIAN SAYS A SECOND REFERENDUM WOULD BE BAD POLITICS AND BAD DEMOCRACY THERE'D BE A FULL SCALE CLASS AND CULTURE WAR HE SAYS BETTER TO RAISE YOUR EYES AND SEE THAT IF BRITAIN HAS TO RENEGOTIATE TRADE TREATIES IT IS THE BEST CHANCE WE'VE HAD IN DECADES TO CONTAIN CORPORATE POWER AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH CARRIES NOT ONE BUT THREE PICTURES FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB IS PICTURED STANDING IN A DOORWAY OF THE SOLID WOODEN KIND AND HE'S GIVEN SPACE TO ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY
HE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO LEAD WOULD CONFRONT THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS THAT AROSE FROM THE REFERENDUM FROM ME FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS A RED LINE HE SAYS THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN OR SEEN SITTING BY WATER FOUNTAIN SHE SAYS CONSERVATORS MUST DO MORE TO MAKE THE POSITIVE CASE FOR IMMIGRATION THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY LIZ TRUSS WRITES A COLUMN BACKING BORIS JOHNSON SHE SAYS THAT MORE THAN ANYONE HE IS THE POLITICIAN WHO CAN BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER
FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT ATATURK AIRPORT IN ISTANBUL YESTERDAY NOW IT IS NOT JUST THE MAJOR GATEWAY INTO TURKEY FOR MANY VISITORS BUT ALSO A TRANSIT HOW PARTICULARLY BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST AND CENTRAL ASIA ONE EYEWITNESS TO THE ATTACK THE BRITISH AID WORKER WILL CARTER WAS THERE YESTERDAY EN ROUTE FROM AFGHANISTAN TO THE U.K. HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE MOMENT HE HEARD THE FIRST EXPLOSIONS I WAS PRETTY ALERT BY THE FIRST EXPLOSION BUT WORKING CONFLICT ZONES IN THEIR FREEZE AN ACCIDENT
WHEN ATTACK AT THAT POINT IN TIME NO NEVER SEEM TO BE REACTING MUCH BUT THE SECOND WILL CLOSURE HAPPENED I WAS QUIET I WANT TO
FOR THERE TO BE A BIT MORE URGENCY WITH HOW THE STAFF ARE DEALING WITH IT SHOUTED THEN FOR US TO TELL US WHEN EMERGENCY EXIT WAS AND THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER THERE IS
THERE'S A FLASH THERE IS THIS LITTLE BALL OF FIRE WAS JUST THAT AT NINE HUNDRED METRES OR SO AWAY WHEREVER ON SOME OF THE THE CEILING HAD COME LOOSE IN FEBRUARY WAS PLAYING
AND THEN WE STARTED RUNNING AFTER THAT THE ONLY EXIT WAS BACK THROUGH THAT AREA WHERE WHERE THAT LAST THE THIRD BOMBER HAD DETONATED IN WHICH YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THE MOORS TO COME PARENTS I NURSED STUD RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT AND THROUGH IMMIGRATION AREA THE CROWDS I THINK FOLLOWED WITH ME
WE WE WE TOOK SHELTER IN ONE OF THE BACK OF THE AIRPORT AFTER THREE EXPLOSIONS PROGRESSIVELY CLOSE HERE IS PRETTY SCARY AND WE WE DIDN'T LEFT WHAT'S TO COME ONCE YOU TOOK SHELTER HOW LONG WERE YOU
NOT SURE ABOUT THE EXACT TIME I THINK IT WAS TWO TO THREE HOURS OR SO AND WHAT COULD YOU HEAR OR SEE AROUND YOU IN THAT PERIOD
FIRST FIRST HOURS SO IT WAS VERY TENSE YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ANXIOUS WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE'D BE MORE EXPLOSIONS AFTER THE INITIAL INITIAL BLAST HERE WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HOW MUCH MORE SAFE THEY ARE HALF AN HOUR AN HOUR AFTERWARDS IT WILL BECOME TO CALM A LITTLE BIT AND WHEN YOU CAME OUT FINALLY WHAT DID YOU SEE AROUND YOU AS YOU WALK THROUGH THE AIRPORT
IT'S QUITE A LARGE HOLE IN THE CEILING SHATTER GLASS AROUND THAT POINT WHERE FAMILIES ME JUST AFTER YOU COLLECT YOUR BAGS AND GONE THROUGH CUSTOMS AND JUST FOR THOSE DOORS OPEN SO IS IT A BIT OF BLOOD ON THE FLOOR IT'S OBVIOUS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED YEAH THERE IS
SO I WAS IN THERE A FEW MOMENTS LATER WHERE EARLIER I THINK YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE IN A VERY TOUGH SITUATION ROOM FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE WELL CARTER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING RHIDIAN BROOK
GOOD MORNING IT IS SAID THAT IN TIMES OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY PEOPLE PRAY MORE SO WE CAN ASSUME THE LINES ARE JAMMED RIGHT NOW AND WITH A RECENT REPORT FROM THE THINK TANK FIOR SUGGESTING THAT PRAYING TOGETHER IS GOOD FOR US WHETHER WE BELIEVE PRAYER WORKS OR NOT MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL BE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE TO PRAY AND SOMEONE TO PRAY WITH
TWENTY YEARS AGO A FRIEND OF MINE STARTED A PRAYER GROUP THAT MET EVERY FRIDAY IN HIS GARDEN SHED
OVER THE YEARS THE SHEDS AND HEADS HAVE CHANGED BUT THE GROUP STILL MEETS IN TWENTY YEARS YOU END UP PRAYING FOR A LOT OF WARS GOVERNMENT COLLAPSES STOCKMARKET CRASHES AND ENGLAND FOOTBALL FIASCOS WERE ALL OUR PRAYERS FOR PEACE AND STABILITY ANSWERED CLEARLY NOT DID WE PRAY YES
TWENTY YEARS AND HAS ALSO SEEN A LOT OF PRESS FOR HELP AND HEALING SHOT OUT FROM SHEDS FRONT ROOMS AND ALLOTMENTS
WAS EVERY SINGLE REQUEST MET NOT REALLY THERE WAS A MAN WE PRAY FOR WHO CAME OUT OF A COMA BUT THERE WAS ALSO THE MOTHER OF TWO WHO DIDN'T COME THROUGH THE CANCER DID WE GIVE UP PRAYING AFTER THAT OF COURSE NOT
IN ITS WIDEST SENSE PRAYER IS A UNIVERSAL HUMAN ACTIVITY AS ELEMENTAL AS BREATHING
FOR SOME IT SPRINGS FROM A YEAR EARNING FAR DEEPER THAN SIMPLY NEEDING TO GET STUFF WE WANT WE KNOW UNLESS WE ARE DELUDED THAT WE CAN NEVER COMPLETELY CONTROL OUR PERSONAL LIVES OR EVENTS IN THE WORLD
SO WE BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT HE'S DONE TO US BY WISHING LONGING DESPAIRING AND HOPING
ALL OF THESE CAN BE FORMS OF PRAYER WE MIGHT PRAY BECAUSE WE ARE GRATEFUL WE MIGHT PRAY BECAUSE WE ARE DESPERATE BUT WE STILL PRAY AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID I'M DRIVEN TO MY KNEES BY THE OVERWHELMING CONVICTION THAT I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
AT ITS MOST BASIC REATA PRAYERS IN THE HOPE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING GOOD UNDERPINNING ALL OF LIFE SOMETHING AT THE CORE OF EXISTENCE THAT CAN BRING STABILITY TO A WOBBLY LIVES IN THIS VOLATILE WORLD
HE'S PRESIDENT HAVE TO BE LONG MORE ELOQUENT AND MAYBE DON'T EVEN REQUIRE A GREAT FAITH MY FRIEND'S PREFERRED PRAYERS WERE USUALLY OH GOD HELP AND JESUS PLEASE DO SOMETHING
JESUS HIMSELF SAID THE SHORTER OPERAS THE BETTER WHEN THE DISCIPLES ASKED HIM HOW TO PRAY HE GAVE THEM THE LORD'S PRAYER ONE OF THE PITHY EST MIXES OF POETRY IN PRACTICALITY EVER UTTERED
BE THANKFUL BE DIRECT AND BRING YOUR REQUESTS THE DO IT ALL WITH HER CONFIDENCE AND HOPE THAT PRAYERS WEATHER OFFERED UP FROM SHARED SAW CARS CATHEDRALS OR BEDS DO NOT GO OUT AND COME BACK VOID BUT I HEARD BY GOD HE WAS A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIMES OF TROUBLE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE WRITER RHIDIAN BROOK THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOMINATIONS TO BE THE NEXT LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THEREFORE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OPEN TODAY SOME M.P.S ARE STILL WEIGHING UP THEIR CHANCES IT SEEMS CLEAR THEY'LL BE LEADERSHIP BIDS FROM THERESA MAY BORIS JOHNSON AND AS MANY AS SIX OTHERS INCLUDING THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRAB ON A JOINT TICKET ALONGSIDE THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SUCH A JOB BUT HE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING MY THEY DON'T WANT TO ARE YOU RUNNING FOR CHANCELLOR
I'M RUNNING ALONGSIDE STEPHEN IF STEPHEN WINS THAT'S THE POSITION I HOPE TO HAVE RIGHT O.K. SO HE IS THE THE PRIME MINISTERIAL CANDID LEAVING ABSOLUTELY WHY
I HAVE I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE TO WORK WITH HIM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE THE PERIOD OUR COUNTRIES ENTERING INTO NOW WHICH IS WON'T BE EASY I THINK WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PERHAPS IN A GENERATION I THINK STEPHEN HAS ABSOLUTELY WHAT IT TAKES TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE SURE IT COMES BACK STRONGER AND ALSO THAT IT COMES OUT AS A MUCH MORE UNITED COUNTRY O.K. YOU WOULD BE TO REMAIN AS LEADING THE COUNTRY IN THE AFTERMATH OF HER LEAVE VOTE
WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR WHAT THE E. USE NUDE WITH BRITAIN'S NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE SHOULD BE WHAT I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE TEAM THAT STEPHEN WILL PUT TOGETHER WOULD BE THE TEAM THAT WOULD LEAD THIS COUNTRY WILL BE STEVE ON ITS OWN AND THAT TEAM WILL INCLUDE PEOPLE THAT WERE ON ALL SIDES OF THE CAMPAIGN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE DECISION CLEARLY HAS BEEN MADE AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GOVERNMENT TO PARLIAMENT HAVE BEEN ISSUED
AND THAT IS THE JOB OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT THAT THERE'LL BE NO GOING BACK ON THAT DECISION THERE'S NO SECOND REFERENDUM AND IT'S ALL ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION DOWN WHO WERE THE BEST PEOPLE THE BEST TEAM YES ACTUALLY GET THIS DONE O.K. SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DISTINCTION ANY MORE BETWEEN WHETHER SOMEONE WAS A A TEAR OR REMAIN IN SOME WAYS WERE ALL BRECHT'S OR TEARS OR CONSERVATIVES AND WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER WITH THE RIGHT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP TO IMPLEMENT THE PEOPLE'S DECISION ISN'T THERE A PERSONAL PROBLEM FOR YOU IN ALL OF THIS IN THAT
IN THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN A KNOWN DURER SCEPTIC FOR A LONG TIME WHEN YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU IN THE END WHEN YOU CAME UP FOR ME AND HE SAID MY HEART SAYS WE'RE BETTER OFF OUT OF MY HEAD SAYS IT'S TOO RISKY RIGHT NOW SO YOU DIDN'T GO WITH WHAT YOU BELIEVED IN YOUR HEART
THEY MIGHT VIEWS ON THIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY CLEAR I STAND BY MY DECISION BUT NOW WE NEED TO ALL OF US WHETHER IT'S ME WHETHER STEPHEN WHETHER IT'S ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WE NEED TO GET ON WITH THIS DECISION AND WE KNOW WORLD WORK THIS DECISION WEREN'T CLEAR I MEAN IAIN DUNCAN SMITH CAME ON THIS PROGRAMME AND SAID HE WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU BACKING REMAIN BECAUSE
YOU TOLD HIM THAT YOU WERE FOR LEAVE THE DECISION OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE IS CLEAR ON THIS AND IT IS IT IS REALLY ALL ABOUT HOW DO WE GET ON WITH IT YOUR POSITION THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WHAT IT WHAT IS REQUITE LET'S JUST LOOK AT LOOK AT LOOK AHEAD OF WHAT'S REQUIRED NOW AS I SAID THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PERIODS NOW FAR COUNTRY WITH THE BRICKS DECISION OF COURSE THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BUT IN A WAY THAT IT PROTECTS OUR ECONOMY WE COME OUT STRONGER
WE DON'T MAKE ANY HASTY DECISIONS AND THAT REQUIRES PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE THERE CAN ACTUALLY DELIVER ON THEIR DECISION BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE THAT ALSO WON'T GO BACK ON THEIR DECISION THERE'S SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT SECOND REFERENDUMS SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE WE EACH HAVE A DIFFERENT POACHED IMMIGRATION IN THE ONE THAT WAS ARTICULATED BY THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AT THE TIME AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE SIZE STEPHEN SETS OUT HIS STALL
I THINK HE WILL MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR HOW HE INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT DECISION AND IMPLEMENT THE PEOPLE'S WAY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU DON'T WANT SO YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMY DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU THINK IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WE MAY HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON FREE MOVEMENT
I THINK THEY'RE FROM THIS DECISION TO THREE THINGS WERE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND WE CANNOT COMPROMISE ON THEM ANYWAY ONE IS OF COURSE TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND TO MAKE SURE U.K. LAW IS SUPREME BUT OF COURSE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WANT ACCESS TO THE MARKET THEY WANT TO KEEP TRADING AS FRIENDS AND I THINK THOSE TWO THINGS ARE PERFECTLY COMPATIBLE
THE SECOND THING WAS CLEARLY AROUND THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THE BRITISH PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW GOING FORWARD THAT IS A POLICY THAT IS IN THE FULL CONTROL OF THE U.K. IMMIGRATION IS UNDER CONTROL AND ALSO WITH THE ACTRESS YOU SUPPORT WHAT BORIS JOHNSON SAID COS HE SAID AT THE START OF THIS WEEK THAT HE THINKS YOU COULD HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND LIMITS TO FREE MOVEMENT YOU COULD JUST SUPPORT HIM THEN
WHICH I SUPPORT SEE FROM CRAB BUT I THINK HE'S THE MAN TO DELIVER THIS IT'S ALL ABOUT DELIVERY NOW AND WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE TEAM THAT CAN ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND GET THIS JOB DONE AND IN STEPHEN AND THE TEAM HE WILL PUT TOGETHER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BUT NO ONE KNOWS ULTIMATELY YET YOU WHAT KIND OF DEAL WERE GOING TO GET WITH THE E.U. BUT YOU NEED PEOPLE
THAT CAN DO THE NEGOTIATION THEY HAVE CLEAR IDEAS THEY CAN BRING IN ASSEMBLE A TEAM THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THEN ULTIMATELY COME UP WITH THE RIGHT DEAL FOR BRITAIN THAT KEEPS OUR ECONOMY OPEN OPEN TO BUSINESS FOR AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST EUROPE BUT ALSO TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW FREEDOMS THAT WILL GET WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE THEN BETWEEN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND LIMITS TO FREE MOVEMENT AND WHAT BORIS JOHNSON HAS
ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT BORIS JOHNSON IS IN THIS ISN'T ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON AND BORIS JOHNSON I'M SURE IN DUE COURSE WILL SET OUT HIS STALL THIS IS ABOUT STEPHEN CRABB AND HOW HE AND HIS TEAM WILL IMPLEMENT THIS DYSPRAXIC DECISION IF I MAY SAY THIS IS MORE THAN JUST ABOUT BRICKS IT OF COURSE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE MAJOR ISSUE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT ANY NEW LEADER OVER THE NEXT MONTHS AND YEARS BUT WE NEED TO ALSO LOOK BEYOND THAT WHAT THE OTHER THING THAT CAME OUT FOR THE REFERENDUM
IS THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO RIGHTLY I THINK IS SOME WAYS USED IT AS A PROTEST AGAINST WESTMINSTER ABOUT PEOPLE IN WESTMINSTER THEY FELT THEY WERE OUT OF TOUCH THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN AND THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S WEALTH ACCUMULATED IT IN OUR COUNTRY AT THE TOP IT'S NOT TRICKLING DOWN TO EVERYONE ELSE THESE ARE THESE ARE BIG ISSUES IN A COUNTRY THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED THEM DEALT WITH SO WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND
EXIT AS WELL I THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE HOW DO WE UNITE AND HEAL THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT IF YOU'RE IN THE POSITION WHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NEGOTIATIONS THERE HAD TO BE A TRADE OFF OR YOU HAD TO DECIDE WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THE SINGLE MARKET OR IMMIGRATION WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PUT IN THAT SITUATION WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE IF WE ARE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE PUT IN THAT SITUATION THAT'S AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO WHY YOU NEED A TEAM THAT CAN DELIVER ON WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED FOR
I'M NOT SITTING HERE PRETENDING IT'S GOING TO BE EASY OF COURSE IT'S NOT THIS IS A HUGE TASK FOR EVERYONE BUT WE NEED THE RIGHT TEAM TO GET THIS DONE AND I THINK AS PEOPLE GET TO KNOW STEPHEN BORN MORE HE'LL BE SETTING OUT HIS STALL TODAY THERE'LL BE A FORMAL LAUNCH TODAY THEY LEARN MORE ABOUT HIM HIS BACKGROUND HOW HE'S DEALT WITH ADVERSITY IN THE PAST AND PHALLUS DEALT HIS CHARACTER SO DID HAVE OTHER BACK HIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON IN BRUSSELS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN IN LONDON
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON HAS TOLD E.U. LEADERS THAT BRITAIN WON'T TURN ITS BACK ON THEM WHEN IT LEAVES BUT HE WARNED THEY WOULD HAVE TO TACKLE CONCERNS ABOUT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABBER REMAIN SUPPORTER IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM HAS DECLARED HIMSELF A CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED MISTER CAMERON AS CONSERVATIVE LEADER
TURKEY HAS BLAMED THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP FOR AN ATTACK ON THE MAIN AIRPORT IN ISTANBUL IN IT WHICH AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND SCOTTY MOORE THE GUITARIST WHO PLAYED ON ELVIS PRESLEY'S FIRST HITS HAS DIED THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
DAVID CAMERON HAS WORN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IT WILL HAVE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT ONE A BIT CENTRAL PRINCIPLES FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AS WELL AS IMMIGRATION AS IT WORKS OUT ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH BRITAIN SPEAKING AFTER AN E.U. SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT HE SAID THE TONE OF THE MEETING WAS ONE OF SADNESS AND REGRET THAT THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE HE SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO UNDUE PRESSURE TO INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY THE FORMAL NOTIFICATION OF LEAVING
BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER TOLD THE B. B. C. MISTER CAMERON SUCCESSOR WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO THAT SPEEDILY IF SOMEONE FROM THE REMAINING CAMP WE'VE BECOME BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
THIS HAS TO BE DONE INTO BEAKS AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT IF THE NEXT BRITISH IS COMING FROM THE LIVE COMPARING IT SHOULD BE DONE TODAY AFTER HAS A POINT
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL SAID ALL THE LEADERS FELT THE E. U. WAS FACING A SEA CHANGE A WATERSHED MOMENT MY CAMERON SAID BRITAIN WANTED THE BEST POSSIBLE PARTNERSHIP IN THE FUTURE A PROCESS THAT WOULD INVOLVE COMPROMISE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
BARRING EMERGENCIES DAVID CAMERON HAS NOW ATTENDED HIS LAST E.U. SUMMIT AND OVER DINNER LAST NIGHT HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING HE NEVER INTENDED TO DO TELL HIS FELLOW LEADERS THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE LEAVING THE E.U.
HIS COLLEAGUES ARE INSISTING THAT THERE CAN BE NO NEGOTIATION ON HER U.K. DEPARTURE BEFORE IT HAS FORMALLY INVOKED ARTICLE FIFTY AT THE LISBON TREATY BUT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE'D NOT BEEN PUT UNDER ANY PRESSURE I THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE READ AND SEE
A CLAMOUR FOR BRITAIN TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WITHOUT DELAY THAT WAS NOT THE MOOD OF THE MEETING THAT WAS NOT WHAT A CLEAR MAJORITY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS SAID BUT OF COURSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE A CLEAR
MODEL UP HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT BRITAIN THINKS IS RIGHT FOR ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE BUT PATIENCE IS LIMITED YOU KNOWS THAT DELAY COULD DAMAGE THE REST OF THE UNION
THERE IS PLENTY OF SCOPE FOR OTHER DISAGREEMENTS DAVID CAMERON ARGUE THAT HE'D LOST THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE THE E.U. HAD FAILED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF FREE MOVEMENT AND IMMIGRATION
BUT DONALD TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL SAID THE E.U. HAD TO DEFEND ITS VALUES WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALSO REASONS
FOLD THAT IN THE U.K. THE MIGRATION THEN TELL A MIGRATION IN EUROPE BUT EVITA A TRUE THAT THE SISTER TO COME
MAINE METAL TO THE VALUE OF FREE MOVEMENT IT'S AND POLLEN AND SHANGO I'M OFFERED THEM SURE THAT THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF
THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN E.U. LEADERS WILL GATHER THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE WITHOUT THE U.K. AT THE TABLE THAT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS
NOMINATIONS OPEN TODAY IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WILL STAND ON A JOINT TICKET WITH THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAGEDE JAVID BORIS JOHNSON AND THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY WILL ALSO INTO THE RACE BEFORE NOMINATIONS CLOSED TOMORROW HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DOBBS THE BLUE COLLAR TICKETS STEPHEN CRABB AND SERGEY JAVID ARE BOTH FROM WORKING CLASS BACKGROUNDS IN CONTRAST TO SOME OF THEIR BLUE BLOODED COLLEAGUES THEY'RE ALSO OUTSIDERS TAKE YOUNG CAMPAIGNS FROM BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY THAT HAVE BEEN LONG IN THE PLANNING BUT OUTSIDERS HAVE A KNACK OF WINNING TORY LEADERSHIP RACES
WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH STEPHEN CRABB PROMISES TO LEAD WHAT HE CALLS A ONE NATION GOVERNMENT A MODERN COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS THAT HOLD PEOPLE BACK HE SAYS
MY CRAB YOU CAMPAIGN FOR HER REMAIN VOTE SAYS A SECOND REFERENDUM IS OUT OF THE QUESTION AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS A RED LINE IT IS INSTEAD HE ARGUES TIME TO CRAFT AN IMMIGRATION POLICY BUT HIS OUTWARD LOOKING ENSURES WE GET THE SKILLS WE NEED AND IS ULTIMATELY DECIDED IN THE U.K.
JEREMY CORBIN IS EXPECTED TO FACE A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE TODAY AFTER THREE QUARTERS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY BACK TO MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM THE FORMER LABOUR LEADER MARGARET BECKETT TOLD US MISTER CORBIN HAD BROUGHT IN A RAFT OF TALENT TO THE SHADOW CABINET THAT THEY HAD GONE BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY COULD NO LONGER DEAL WITH THE SITUATION IN ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN
FAR FROM BACKING DOWN MISTER CORBIN WILL TODAY UNDERLINE HIS DETERMINATION TO FIGHT ON BY ADDRESSING A RALLY OF HIS SUPPORTERS TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE LOOMING CLASH AHEAD LEFT LEANING M.P.S AND UNION FIGURES OF THIS MORNING EXPECTED TO MAKE ONE FINAL PLEAD TO MISTER CORBIN TO STAND ASIDE
HIS CRITICS HOWEVER FEAR THE LABOUR LEADER IS BEING UNDULY INFLUENCED BY HIS SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL AND OTHERS WHO WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE A STAND IN AN EFFORT TO RESHAPE THE LABOUR PARTY SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME ONE OF THE PARTIES MOST SENIOR M.P.S MARGARET BECKETT URGED MISTER CORBIN TO THINK AGAIN NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS JEREMY'S THE NICE LABEL IT AND I HAVE SAID
NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I IMAGINE THAT I WOULD BE CASTING A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WITH THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS AND APPROACH SHIPS A RIVAL CANDIDATE PROBABLY THE FORMER SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE IS LIKELY TO BE ANNOUNCED AFTER PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS BUT I HOPE THAT MISTER CORBIN'S RELATIVE ISOLATION IN THE COMMONS WITH A DENUDED FRONT BENCH WILL FURTHER INCREASE THE PRESSURE ON HIM TO QUIT
AT THE SAME TIME THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY WILL ASK THE SPEAKER TO DECLARE THEM RATHER THAN LABOUR AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION GIVEN ONLY FORTY M.P.S ARE NOW PREPARED TO BACK MISTER CORBIN
AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN A GUN AND BOMB ATTACK ON ISTANBUL'S ATATURK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OTHERS WERE WOUNDED WHEN THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS OPEN FIRE WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS BEFORE BLOWING THEMSELVES UP AT A SECURITY CHECKPOINT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TERMINAL BUILDING THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE TROOPERS WAS BEHIND THE ATTACK A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT MARK LOAN HAD JUST LANDED AT THE AIRPORT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

AND KURDISH MILITANTS SINCE THE CEASEFIRE WITH THE P.K.K. BROKED
CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT TALK OF SECURITY LAPSES AND POLICY FAILURES THAT HAVE ALLOWED CELLS TO GROW WITHIN TURKEY THE GOVERNMENT DENIES THE CHARGE ATATURK AIRPORT HAS LONG SEEMED A SOFT TARGET FEW VEHICLES ARE CHECKED DRIVING IN THEIR SCANNERS ARE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TERMINAL

A RULE BOOK COVERING THE CONDUCT OF UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES AND HOW THEY'RE VETTED AND OVERSEEN HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DRAFT GUIDANCE BANS SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND SAYS OFFICERS MUST SUBMIT TO REGULAR PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING
THE ROCK'N'ROLL GUITARIST SCOTTY MOORE BEST KNOWN FOR PLAYING ON ELVIS PRESLEY'S EARLY RECORDINGS HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR IS CREDITED WITH COMBINING ELEMENTS OF COUNTRY AND WESTERN RHYTHM AND BLUES AND GOSPEL TO CREATE A SOUND THAT INFLUENCED A GENERATION OF ROCK GUITARISTS JASON KATIE LOOKS BACK AT HIS LIFE AND CAREER
SCOTTY MOORE STARTED PLAYING THE GUITAR AT THE AGE OF EIGHT AND BY HIS EARLY TWENTIES WAS A SESSION MUSICIAN IN MEMPHIS WHERE HE AND BASIS BILL BLACK WERE TEAMED UP WITH A TEENAGED ELVIS PRESLEY
IT'S A CLUB
REGARDED BY MANY AS THE FIRST ROCK'N'ROLL SONG ELVIS'S FIRST HIT LED TO A STRING OF SUCCESSES WITH THE SAME BAND INCLUDING HOUND DOG HEARTBREAK HOTEL AND JAILHOUSE ROCK
SCOTTY MOORE STYLE INFLUENCED A GENERATION OF GUITARISTS TO FOLLOW INCLUDING BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN LED ZEPPELIN'S JIMMY PAGE AND ROLLING STONES KEITH RICHARDS WHO ONCE OBSERVED WHILE EVERYONE ELSE WANTED TO BE ELVIS HE WANTED TO BE SCOTT
JASON KAYE REPORTING IT IS NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE DONE IT STRIDING PURPOSELY ONTO THE STAGE HERE IN BRUSSELS PLANTING HIS FEET LIKE A RUGBY PROP FORWARD PREPARING FOR A SCRUM GRIPPING THE SIDES OF THAT PRIME MINISTERIAL LECTERN STARING DOWN THE T. V. CAMERA LENSES BEFORE DECLARING BRITAIN VICTORY FOR BRITAIN NOT THIS TIME NOT LAST NIGHT
EVER SO SLOWLY EVER SO QUIETLY HAVE A SO SADLY RATHER DIMINISHED DAVID CAMERON APPEARED FOR A LATE NIGHT POST SUMMIT NEWS CONFERENCE HIS LAST AND ONE OF THE LAST EVER TO BE MADE BY ANY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER GOOD GOOD EVENING EVERYONE I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE EUROPEAN COUNCILS FOR SIX YEARS
BARRING AN EMERGENCY COUNCIL OF WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IN THE LAST SIX YEARS THIS WILL BE MY LAST ONE TONIGHT OBVIOUSLY WAS AN IMPORTANT MEETING IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THE EUROPEAN CANCELLED MET SINCE THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND THERE WAS THE UNIVERSAL RESPECT FOR THIS DECISION AND THIS DECISION
WILL BE CARRIED THROUGH IN BRITAIN AND HE'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WILL BE CARRIED THROUGH HERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT OF COURSE THE TONE OF THE MEETING WAS ONE OF SADNESS AND REGRET
SADNESS AND REGRET AT THE FACT THAT BRITAIN HAD CHOSEN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN CLUB IT SPENT SO MANY YEARS FIGHTING TO GET INTO SADNESS AND REGRET THAT WE ARE THE FIRST COUNTRY IN AN ORGANISATION USED TO WELCOMING A STEADY FLOW OF NEW MEMBERS WHICH HE'S CHOSEN TO QUIT
BUT NOT EVERYONE IT SEEM LAST NIGHT WAS QUITE SO MISTY HIDE THE MESSAGE FROM JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER THE MAN DAVID CAMERON HAD TRIED SO HARD TO STOP BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WAS QUITE SIMPLY I TOLD YOU SO HAS HE OFFERED UP THAT DISH WHICH IS SAID TO BE BEST SERVED COLD
IF YOU ARE OVER YOU'VE NOT THE KATE'S TELLING OF PUBLIC THAT MEANS YOUR SENSES THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH EUROPEAN UNION THAT THIS EUROPEAN UNITY IS TO BUILD QUALITY TO DETECT A QUITE BIG YOU WERE UNDERTAKEN BY SUPPLIERS
IF VOTERS WILL BE BELIEVE YOU
THE FRENCH BUT NEVERTHELESS WE NEED WOMEN THAT'S THE ONLY THING WHICH WILL REMAIN THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN YOUR PITCH
THIS SUMMIT THIS INSTITUTION THIS CITY IS IN SHOCK IN EVERY CORNER DOWN EVERY CORRIDOR IN EVERY RESTAURANT THE CONVERSATION IS THE SAME HOW ON EARTH DID IT COME TO THIS OR MIGHT JUST BE POSSIBLE THAT THE BRITS WILL FIND AN EXIT FROM BRICKS
ONLY ONE THING SEEMS TO CHEER THEM IN A CURIOUS WAY THE THOUGHT THAT BRITAIN IS PAYING A HEAVY PRICE FOR DARING TO LEAVE A PROMISE GRAPHICALLY SPELL TALES BY MARK RUTTER THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER UNUSUALLY AN ARCH ALLY OF DAVID CAMERON'S MIGHT BE BUSY COLLIE CHRIS MORRIS ASKED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE'D SAID
YOU SAID ON YOUR WAY IN THAT ENGLAND HAS COLLAPSED POLITICALLY MUN A TERRIBLY CONSTITUTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'VE GOT LEFT WHILE THE B.B.C. THE B.B.C.
I'VE GOT WANTED BASICALLY ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS SINCE LAST FIND IT WE HAVE SEEN PROSTITUTION
THAT BASTARD YOU CAME ON TO BREAK AWAY WE HAVE SEEN POLITICALLY THAT THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES ARE IN DISARRAY THE PUNTERS AT THE LEVEL IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND ECONOMICALLY WE HAVE SEEN ALMOST ALL THE BIGGER BUSINESSES IN YOUR GAME SMALLER BUSINESSES TOO SICK TO TELL US THAT HE WILL HOLD NEW INVESTMENTS AND ARE CONSIDERING LEAVING YOUR KINGDOM
FOR EVERYBODY THINKING IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT THAT MISTER RITTER HOPES THEY THE OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS HOPE WILL BE A WARNING TO ANY OTHER LEADER WHO DARES TO CONTEMPLATE FOLLOWING THE SAME PATH AS DAVID CAMERON A WARNING TO TO HIS SUCCESSOR THAT HOWEVER THEY MIGHT DISLIKE HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT DISLIKE THE E.U. THEY WILL DISLIKE THE ALTERNATIVE
OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRIME MINISTER NICK ROBINSON B.B.C. A FRIEND OF YOURS I BELIEVE AN ALLY OF YOURS MARK WROTE TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NETHERLANDS HAD A VERY STARK VERDICT HE SAID ENGLAND HAS COLLAPSED POLITICALLY MULLET TERRIBLY CONSTITUTIONALLY
AND ECONOMICALLY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT AND CAN I ASK YOU ON A MUCH MORE PERSONAL BASIS HAVING FOLLOWED YOU ALL THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN PRIME MINISTER I SENSE THIS IS A SAD NIGHT FOR YOU PERSONALLY
DO YOU FEEL A SADNESS A WISTFULNESS PERHAPS EVEN AN ANGER AND REGRET THAT WHEN YOU LEAVE TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY THERE WILL BE AN EMPTY CHAIR BRITAIN WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED AT A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL SUMMIT
IT WAS YOUR FIRST QUESTION I MEAN I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE BRITAIN IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY STRENGTHENED OUR ECONOMY OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OF NATO WHICH WILL BE MEETING SHORTLY MEMBERS OF THE G.SEVEN WHICH IS JUST MET THERE WAS THE G. TWENTY WILL BE MEETING IN SEPTEMBER LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMONWEALTH LOCALS WILL BE HOSTING THE COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BRITAIN IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST CONNECTED NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD I MEAN I AND OF COURSE IT'S A SAD NIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THIS POSITION I WANTED BRITAIN TO STAY IN A REFORMED EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT HARD OF ONE NEGOTIATION
WHICH TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK THAT NOW IS NOT OPERATIVE SO GETTING OUT OF EVER CLOSER UNION GETTING A DEAL TO RESTRICT WELFARE FOR PEOPLE COMING INTO THE U.K. CUTTING BUREAUCRACY AND ALL THE REST WITH THOSE THINGS AREN'T GOING TO HAPPEN WHICH OBVIOUSLY I'M AGAIN PERSON IS SAD ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WAS EH
FAR BETTER OUTCOME OF THE STATUS QUO AND BETTER THAN LEAVING SO OF COURSE THERE'S THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M A DEMO
I FOUGHT VERY HARD FOR WHAT I BELIEVED
I DIDN'T STAND BACK AND SAY WELL EITHER OUTCOME IS INTERESTING ONE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE OTHER I THREW MYSELF IN HEAD HEART AND SOUL TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I DIDN'T SUCCEED AND IN POLITICS YOU HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT YOU FIGHT AND WHEN YOU WIN YOU CARRY OUT YOUR PROGRAMME BUT WHEN YOU LOSE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SAY RIGHT
I'VE LOST THAT ARGUMENT I'VE LOST THAT DEBATED RIGHT TO HAND OVER TO SOMEONE ELSE WILL TAKE THE COUNTRY FORWARD THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH INDEED FOR COMING SLIGHTLY BETTER ATTEND A PRESS CONFERENCE AND SOME OF THE ONES I'VE DONE OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS BUT YOU'RE ALL VERY WELCOME THANKS
AND WITH THAT HE WAS GONE THE PRIME MINISTER FLEW HOME THERE IS IN FACT A BRITISH AND EMPTY BRITISH CHAIR TODAY THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN LEADERS HAVE BEGUN TO ARRIVE HERE IN BRUSSELS THEY WILL MEET TO DISCUSS BRICKS IT
WITHOUT BRITAIN AND WATCHING THEM WILL BE A EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ALAN ADLER WHO JOINS MENO BRUSSEL STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT ISN'T IT A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HOME THE OTHERS MEETING WITHOUT HIM
IT'S A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT MOMENT YOU HEARD THE FRENCH PRESIDENT YESTERDAY FRANCOIS HE SAID THIS IS A HISTORICAL MOMENT IT WAS A MEMBER OF A EUROPEAN UNION CHOSE TO LEAVE BUT HE SAID HISTORY DOESN'T END WITH BRECHT IT AND I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH OF THE MOOD IN WHICH THE TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES AND MEETS TODAY YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF LITHUANIA ON HER WAY AND SHE WAS SORT OF
PUNCHES ABOVE HER WEIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW SHE FEATURES IT'S A VERY SORT OF PITHY TURN OF PHRASE SHE SAID TODAY'S NOT ABOUT HIM
IT'S NOT ABOUT CAMERON IS ABOUT US SO THEY WILL CHOOSE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO HANDLE BRECK SETS BUT ALSO THIS IS KEY FOR THEM THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT THE U.K. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THEM HANDLING BRICKS IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THEY FEAR THAT WORD OFTEN USED IN THIS CITY CLINT EH JIM THE IDEA THAT OTHERS MIGHT GET THE SAME IDEA
THAT'S RIGHT AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE LISTEN TO THE DEBATE ASIDE THE U.K. WHAT COULD A FUTURE TRAY DEAL BE WITH WITH THE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE ARE THEIR ESCAPE CLAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD NOW FROM UNCLE OR MICHAEL HERE AT THE SUMMIT AND FROM FRANCOIS LAWNS AND DON'T FORGET THESE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING ACTUAL DECISIONS THEY SAY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE
FULL ACCESS OR VERY CLOSE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND HAVE CURBS ON E.U. MIGRATION THEY'VE SAID THAT VERY VERY CLEARLY THIS IS NOT JUST TO THE U.K. THEY'RE SAYING IT TO THE DOMESTIC AUDIENCES THEY'RE SAYING IT TO ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION TO THOSE EUROSCEPTIC PUBLIC AND FRANCOIS A LOT PARTICULARLY TO THE VERY EUROSCEPTIC FRIEND SHE GOES TO THE POLLS DON'T FORGET NEXT YEAR TO WHICH SOME MIGHT SAY THEY SIMPLY DON'T GET IT
OR IS IT THAT THEY ARE JUST WOULDN'T WANTING TO APPEAR TO SOUND TOUGH AND ONCE THEY GOT THROUGH THOSE ELECTIONS IN FRANCE IN GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE THAT THEY WILL THEN DO THE SORT OF DEAL THAT BORIS JOHNSON THAT OTHER LEADING CONTENDERS TO BE PRIME MINISTER TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'LL BE IN THEIR INTEREST
I'M GONNA TO IS NOT ONE TO GIVE UP WILL NOT WANT TO GIVE UP ON GERMAN TRADE INTERESTS AND ANGLE MICHAEL DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE UP ON HER CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. EVEN THOUGH WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE FRANCO GERMAN MOTOR AND OF THE Y. YOU SHE'S ALWAYS FELT POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY IF YOU LIKE MUCH CLOSER TO THE ANGLO SAXON MODEL SHE DOESN'T WANT A FRONT TO TAKE OVER TO BECOME MORE PROTECTIONIST SO YES SHE WILL WANT TO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THERE WILL BE WIGGLE ROOM IT'S A CITY OF COMPROMISE BUT DON'T EXPECT THAT QUICKLY THEY DO NOT WANT AN EASY GENEROUS DEAL FOR THE U.K. THEY WANT TO PUT OTHERS OFF LEAVING AND BRIEFLY JUST TO BE CLEAR DAVID CAMERON SUCCESS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO COME TO E.U. SUMMITS IT'S JUST ONE BREAKS IT IS DISCUSSED HE OR SHE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
ABSOLUTELY UNTIL NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FINISHED ON A NEW DEAL A NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE E.U. AND THE U.K. REMAINS A MEMBER OF THE E.U. WITH FULL RIGHTS AND FULL COMMITMENTS BUT THAT PRECLUDES ANY UNILATERAL ACTION ON ON EITHER SIDE OF COURSE CATCH ADLER A EUROPE EDITOR THANK YOU

THE S.N.P. WERE ASKED TO BE DECLARED THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION AT WESTMINSTER THEY SAY THEIR LEADER IN THE COMMONS ANGUS ROBERTSON ENJOYS MORE SUPPORT THAN THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN THERE ARE FIFTY SIX S.N.P. M.P.S BUT ONLY FORTY LABOUR M.P.S HAVE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR MISTER CORBIN IS EXPECTED TO FACE A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE AFTER HE LOST A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM

THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS HAVE ATTACKED ISTANBUL'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT KILLING AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO SAID ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK
THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE A HEINOUS PLANNED ATTACK THAT TARGETED INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT IS HOW TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER HAS DESCRIBED THAT ATTACK THAT IS CLAIMED THIRTY SIX LIVES AND LEFT MANY OTHERS INJURED THREE GUNMEN WERE INVOLVED ONE OPEN FIRE IN THE DEPARTURES HALL SENDING PASSENGERS' DIVING FOR COVER POLICE FIRED SHOTS TO TRY TO STOP THEM JUST BEFORE THEY REACHED TO SECURITY CHECKPOINT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARRIVALS HALL BUT THEY DETONATED THEIR EXPLOSIVES
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT SAY THAT ISLAMIC STATE WAS BEHIND ME ASSAULT OR JOINED ON THE LINE FROM COVENTRY UNIVERSITY BY THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR TRUST PEACE AND SOCIAL RELATIONS BY PROFESSOR AMPERSAND AS ADAM GOOD MORNING TRIBUTE TO YOU PROFESSOR
GOOD MORNING HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS IT FOR TURKEY TO BE ABLE TO SEE CLEARLY THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK BY THE SO CALLED I.S.
IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE WAY THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT TO SHOW ALL THE INDICATIONS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE IN TURKEY
AND ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT AN AIRPORT WAS TARGETED OR IN A SENSE DO WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE FACT THAT THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS ON SOFT VULNERABLE AREAS IN WHICH THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE NOW HIGHLY LIKELY
ADY IS STUMBLE I TODAY A PART IS IS A PRIME TARGET BECAUSE HISTORY TO BUSY IS THE TURK BUSIEST AIRPORT IN EUROPE AND THIS VERY SIGNIFICANT PLACE FOR TURKISH ECONOMY AND SO I'M NOT SURPRISED IN THE WAY THAT THE DE TERRORISTS TARGETED THE AIRPORT AND AND I THINK THIS A SHOT OF STOUT SUCH ATTACKS COULD TAKE PLACE
ANYWHERE IN TERMS OF THE DE DE DE NATURE ASKED TO PLACE AND THEY HAVE NO RESERVATION SORT OF ATTACKING AND KILLING CIVILIANS
THAT MESSAGE THAT IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR TURKEY ISN'T IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE AN EVEN MORE DRAMATIC DROP IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TRAVEL TO THE COUNTRY FOR TOURISM
IT'S TRUE THAT THE TURKS TOURISM HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE OFF THE ATTACKS OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND PROBABLY IN THE MINDS OF MANY PEOPLE TOTALLY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SO CLOSE TO TRAVEL TO BUT I THINK THIS WOOD ON THE SORT OF A GAVE WHAT THE TERRORISTS WANT WHAT WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE
YES IT MIGHT TAKE PLACE ANYWHERE IN TURKEY BUT ALSO IT MY TAKE PLACE IN THE U.K. AS IT'S DEPRESSING
YOU KNOW OUT OF PLACES AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR TURKEY STRATEGICALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A SENSE UP UNTIL RECENTLY THAT I S. WERE NOT CRUCIAL IN THE MINDS OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT BUT THEIR PRIORITY WAS DEALING WITH KURDISH SEPARATIST RATHER THAN WORRYING ABOUT TERRORISM FROM THIS SOURCE
THE LAST OF OUR FIRE SIX MONTHS ISLAMIC STATE HAS BECOME A TARGET OF TURKISH AERIAL ATTACKS IN NORTHERN SYRIA
AND AND I THINK THIS MIGHT EVEN BE A REACTION TO TERRITORY AND YOUR RELATIONS THAT DOUBT THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY IN THE AGREEMENT TO RESTART AT DOES RELATIONSHIPS YESTERDAY AND ALSO TURKEY IS WARMING HIS RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA
IT TURNED OUT WAS THAT WAS SOME DEVELOPMENTS WITH THAT YESTERDAY SO IF TO SET OUR TED THAT HAD REALLY BEEN CARRIED OUT BY BY THE ISLAMIC STATE THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF A RICH RELATION AND THE CONNECTION WHERE TO PUT THOSE DECISIONS
PROFESSOR RESIDENT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE WE'LL HAVE THE FULL LIST TOMORROW OF THOSE LAUNCHING BIDS TO BE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOMINATIONS OPEN THIS MORNING ONE OF THOSE CONSIDERING A BEARD IS THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN WHO BACKED REMAIN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND SAYS IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY THAT CONSERVATIVES SHOULD DO MORE TO EXPLAIN THE BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION
SHE JOINS US NOW FROM OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HAVE YOU DECIDED THAT YOU ARE RUNNING NO NO I'M ACTUALLY CONSIDERING IT AND TALKING TO LOTS OF COLLEAGUES AND PEOPLE IN BOTH THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY AND OBVIOUSLY LIKE A ALSO I HAVE UNTIL MIDDAY TOMORROW TO MAKE UP MY MIND RIGHT SO LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU ARE GOING TO REFUND FOR THE BASIS OF THIS INTERVIEW WHAT WOULD BE THE ESSENCE OF YOUR CAMPAIGN
MY CAMPAIGN IS THAT OF COURSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE RESULTS FROM LAST WEEK AND THE EXIT NEGOTIATIONS FROM THE E.U. TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE BUT WE CANNOT HAVE THE NEXT THREE AND A HALF YEARS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY DEFINED BY JUST EUROPE WE HAVE A MANIFESTO WE WERE AT JEAN LAST YEAR WE HAVE A CENTRE GROUND TO BRITISH POLITICS WHICH WE NEED TO APPEAL TO I'M A MARGINAL SEAT MEMBER PALM I WON MY SEAT OFF THE LABOUR PARTY AND TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO BUILD A COALITION OF VOTERS THAT'S WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
NEEDS TO DO TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE RIGHT SO BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT EUROPE BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER HAS TO DEAL WITH FROM DAY ONE AND INDEED EVERYONE HAS TO ADDRESS IN IN THE RUN UP TO TWO TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULT WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL FOR EUROPE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN IT INVOLVES A PRETTY HARD FOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE E.U. BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS GOING TO BE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
AND ACCEPTING THAT COMING WITH THAT AS WE MADE THE CASE IN THE CAMPAIGN IS SOME MOVEMENT OF OF PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY THE POINT I'M MAKING THE ARTICLE TODAY IS THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE CASE TO BE MADE FOR IMMIGRATION WHICH WE DEVON OFTEN HEARD PEOPLE COME HERE THEY BRING THEIR TALENTS THEIR SKILLS AND THEY PAY THEIR TAXES WHICH OBVIOUSLY FOND ARE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND SO I THINK WE DID A MUCH BETTER DEBATE AND CONVERSATION BUT WE HAD THAT DEBATE DIDN'T WE OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN THE ELECTORATE DECIDED
DIFFERENTLY AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS VOTED TO LEAVE IN THIS REFERENDUM ON THE BASIS OF WANTING AND ENTER FREE MOVEMENT YOU WOULD NOT BE THE CANDIDATE FOR THEM WHY DON'T WE DID HAVE THAT DEBATE I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT ACTUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE OR SO WE HAVEN'T HAD A DEBATE AND PEOPLE FEEL THAT IMMIGRATION HAS OBVIOUSLY A CHANGE THEIR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK IT'S A COME ON POLITICIANS TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IT'S NOT
BLAMING IMMIGRANTS ABOUT JOBS AND HOUSING ASHES TO ASKED YOU TO PROVIDE THE OTHER SOLUTIONS AND TO TALK TO PEOPLE LOOK I'M A I'M A MIDLANDS MARSHALL M.P. I REPRESENT DIVERSE COMMUNITY HAVE LESTER THE FIRST MAJORITY NON WHITE CITY NOT FAR AWAY FROM ME WERE ACTUALLY PEOPLE HAVE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD NIGHT INTEGRATION AND BUT I'M JUST KEEN TO TO US ESTABLISH THIS THAT YOU SUPPORTED REMAIN IN THE CAMPAIGN WE ENDED UP WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT AND YOU WERE ALSO SAYING NOW ESSENTIALLY THE PEOPLE
WE'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO END FREE MOVEMENT WHERE THAT LIVES YOU'RE OUT OF STEP WITH THE LARGE PART OF THE ELECTORATE I THINK WHAT PEOPLE WANTED HIS CONTROL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LOST CONTROL OVER THE ARRIVALS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTROL OVER FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE I STILL THINK I STILL THINK THAT WE DO HAVE THAT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE SADNESSES OF THEIR CAMPAIGN WAS THE QUALITY OF THE BAIT ON THAT LOOK WE HAVE THE RESULTS FROM LAST WEEK IT'S UP TO US AS POLITICIANS
TO NOW MAKE SURE WE GET OF THE SAY THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL TO FOLLOW THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE SAY WHAT WHATEVER SIDE OF DEBATE PEOPLE ON THAT DEBATE IS OVER AND WE NOW HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY BUT I'M ALSO SAYING THAT WE CANNOT AS A PARTY THE ONLY ABOUT THE E.U. I THINK WHAT LAST WEEK'S RESULTS SHOWED
WAS A DIVIDED NATION BETWEEN YOUNG AND OLD BETWEEN ON THE E.U. WELL I KNOW I THINK I MEAN I THINK IT SHOWED THAT WE WERE RIGHT AND IT WAS A VOTE ABOUT THE Y. YOU DID THAT DID CRYSTALLISED TO VISIONS
I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I SEE THIS IS EDUCATION SECRETARY IS THIS ISSUE OF INTER GENERATIONAL UNFAIRNESS THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT IT WAS THEIR JOBS ARE AFFECTED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSIONAL LACK OF GRADUATE JOBS OR HOUSING IS A BIG CONCERN TO THEM I WOULD ARGUE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BIG AND BOLD AND WITH THE ONE THINGS WE COULD DO WE OFFERING SIXTEEN SEVENTY YEAR OLDS SHE SAYING WE WANT THEM TO TAKE PART IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS THAT'S WHAT HIS RATE OF ME WHEN I GO AND SPEAK TO SCHOOLS AND SICK FORMS THAT ISN'T SHE RAISED ME ALL THE TIME IT'S A LITTLE B. SHOULD HE RENEGOTIATION I MEAN IN IN THE NEGOTIATION GOING FORWARD ON ON OUR EXIT FROM THE E.U. THE RED LINE FOR YOU THEN WOULD BE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THAT WOULD BE PARAMOUNT TO QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BUSINESSES AND ORGANISATIONS ARE MOST LOOKING FOR AT THE MOMENT IS THAT CERTAINTY AND STABILITY WE CAN ALREADY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED WE'RE HEARING ABOUT ISSUES AMONGST THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY REAL REAL WORRIES AND I I WORRY ABOUT PARTICULARLY THIS ISSUE ABOUT INVESTMENT BUY BY BUSINESSES IN TERMS OF GROWTH BUT ALSO ABOUT HIRING AND JOBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I THINK THAT WHOEVER TAKES OVER IF IT IF IT WERE TO BE ABOUT MAKING SURE WE GET THE BEST CULTURE AND A QUICK DEAL WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CERTAINTY
AND STABILITY WHAT PEOPLE CAN'T ABIDE IS A IS A VACUUM AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS STRONG LEADERSHIP COS WE CAN SEE WITH THE OPPOSITION ACTUALLY THEY HAVE VACATED THE GROUND'S UNDERGROUND TO BRITISH POLITICS AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PROVIDE AN OPPOSITION YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW DO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'D BEEN A PROPER DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION FROM THE REMAIN SIDE DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN I MEAN YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT WOULDN'T YOU MEMBER OF THE CABINET YOU'RE A PROMINENT PART OF THAT SIDE BUT ALSO YOU'RE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT
THAT HAS TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRATION OVER THE YEARS YOU PRINCIPALLY WITH THAT TARGET ARE BRINGING THE NUMBERS DOWN HAS FAILED TO DELIVER AND THAT IS PART OF WHY PEOPLE HAVE LOST TRUST ON THIS ISSUE
I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT INEVITABLY IF POLITICIANS MAKE PROMISES OR COMMITMENTS AND THEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE IS NOT JUST ON THIS IT'S OTHER THINGS AS WELL WE'VE ENDED UP SOMETIMES A BIT OF A SOUND BITE POLITICAL ERA AND PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS I SAY TODAY IN THAT INTERVIEW WAS ABOUT BEING HELPED IN HUNT ARE LEVEL WITH THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY HAVING A PROPER AS A. A CONVERSATION AND A DEBATE ABOUT ISSUES THAT THEY THAT THEY CARE ABOUT GOD MICKEY MORGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
TIME NOW IS QUARTER TO NINE HE'S SHAMBA TAR HAS WRITTEN TWO CELEBRATED BOOKS OF FICTION EXPLORING THE TRAGEDY OF LIBYA WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS TORN APART IN THE GOOD FOR YEARS AND WHERE HIS FATHER WAS ARRESTED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IN HIS NEW BOOK THE RETURN HE TELLS THE HARROWING STORY OF HIS OWN ATTEMPTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FATHER AN OPPONENT OF THE CND HAPPY REGIME
WAS HE STILL ALIVE AND IF NOT HOW DID HE DIE JIM KNOCKED IT HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM ABOUT THE BOOK
CHAPTER ONE TRAP DOORS EARLY MORNING MARCH TWENTY TWELVE
MY MOTHER MY WIFE DIANA AND I WERE SITTING IN A ROW OF SEATS THEY WERE BOLTED TO THE TILED FLOOR FOR LOUNGE IN CAIRO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
FLIGHT EIGHT THREE FIVE FOUR BLOUSY HER VOICE ANNOUNCED WAS DUE TO DEPART ON TIME
EVERY NOW AND THEN WHERE MOTHER GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT ME DIANA TO SEEMED CONCERNED SHE PLACED HER HAND ON MY ARM AND SMILED
I SHOULD GET UP AND WALK AROUND I TOLD MYSELF BUT MY BODY REMAINED RIGID HAD NEVER FELT MORE CAPABLE OF STILLNESS
WHEN YOU WENT BACK AND SAW WHAT HAD HAPPENED FELT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND BEGAN TO WRITE EFFECTIVELY A JOURNAL WHAT WAS THE EFFECT ON YOU
I THOUGHT SUBMERGED BY THE PLACE BY MY EMOTIONS TOWARDS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW WHAT TOOLS STOOL TO APPROACH THIS PLACE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE PAST TO MEMORIES TO MY FATHER AND SO THEY DID WHAT ALL WRITERS DO WHICH IS A VERY APPROACH THE WORLD WITH THE TOOLS THEY HAD AND THAT WAS ONE WAY OF KEEPING AFLOAT
YOU WERE GOING BACK AFTER MANY YEARS
AND THERE WAS A QUEST AT THE HEART OF IT TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER AFTER HIS ARREST AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE BOOK DOESN'T ENTIRELY RESOLVE THAT QUESTION DOES THAT MEAN THAT
IT IS AS PAINFUL NOW AS IT WAS BEFORE YOU BEGAN OR IS THERE SOME MEASURE OF RECONCILIATION INVOLVED IN HAVING WRITTEN IN THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR FATHER YOU LOOKING FOR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO AND ALTHOUGH THE BOOK HASN'T HAD A CATHARTIC EFFECT ON MY LIFE
IT WAS A MOMENT FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT THIS OBSESSION BUT I'VE HAD FOR MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE FORTY FIVE MY FATHER DISAPPEARED WHEN I WAS NINETEEN
AND ALL THROUGH THAT TIME AND MY YOU KNOW THAT THE RIVER OF MY LIFE WAS GUIDED BY THIS MISHAPS
WITH GUNFIRE BEEN HEARD ACROSS TRIPOLI RUMOUR SWEPT LIBYA THAT COLONEL GADDAFI HAD FLED CYCLE IS LONGER DAVID THEN MADE A RAMBLING UNSCRIPTED APPEARANCE ON STATE T.V.
WE WILL NOT LET YOU GO WE WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST MEN TO THE LAST BULLET THERE ARE PASSAGES IN THE BOOK WHERE YOU COME FACE TO FACE WITH SEE IF I WAS LAMP GADAFFI SON
AND THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FORCES THAT TOOK YOUR FATHER FROM YOU
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARILY PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND WRITING IT WAS TO TO NOT COLLAPSE IT INTO THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSIONS AND I DON'T KNOW PARIS DOING HMM
POINTING OUT AS YOU KNOW HAS FLAWS BUT TO TRY TO EVOKE THAT TIME IN TO JUST LEAVE IT THERE SUSPENDED FOR THE FOR THE READER FISHER MY TA THANK YOU
BUT I WAS TALKING TO JIM KNOTTY THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE BEFORE THE REFERENDUM MOST BIG BUSINESSES CAMPAIGN FOR REMAIN NOW THE PEOPLE HAVE DELIVERED A DIFFERENT OUTCOME THEY NEED TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT THE FORMER NUMBER TEN ADVISOR ROHAN SILVER HAS TOLD HIS COUNTERPARTS IN THE TECH SECTOR TO CHEER UP AND STRATEGISE WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY TWO BUSINESS PEOPLE WHO WERE FOR LEAVE JOHN MILLS CHAIRMAN OF THE SHOPPING CHANNEL COMPANY J. M. L. AND FORMER DEPUTY CHAIR OF VOTE LEAVE UNTIL HE LEFT EARLIER THIS YEAR TO JOIN LABOUR LEAVE
AND ALSO BY FARES ON ABOUT WELL HE'S THE FOUNDER OF COWS AND P. AH GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH A JOHN MILLS WERE YOU PREPARED FOR THE REACTION THAT WE SAW ON THE CURRENCY MARKETS AND ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO THE OUTCOME WELL I WAS A BIT SURPRISED BY HOW BIG THE REACTION WAS I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A REACTION AND I WAS ALSO VERY SURPRISED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE REACTION OF MANY PEOPLE WIN THAT LEAVE RESULT CAME THROUGH
THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH BALANCE ABOUT A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BUT OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WERE DISAPPOINTED UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE WORLD HASN'T COME TO AN END THERE'S LOTS WE CAN DO TO MAKE A BIG SUCCESS OF THE BRICKS IT TO DECISION WE'VE NOW TAKEN AND THAT'S THE WAY I THINK WE NEED TO FACE A BUSINESS A SIX A BUSINESS SUCCESS BECAUSE I'LL BE MANY BUSINESSES WERE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM WELL I THINK THE BIG ISSUE IS WHETHER BRECHT'S IT IS GOING TO LEAD
IN THE MEDIUM AND LONG TERM TO A BETTER ECONOMIC OUTCOME RATHER THAN THE WORSE ONE AND I MUST SAY THE GOT LOTS GOING TO DEPEND ON THEIR POLICIES ARE PURSUED BUT IF THEIR OUTWARD LOOKING POLICIES STOP PROTECTIONIST ONCE IT REDUCE UNNECESSARY REGULATION WHICH HELPED THE CITY TO COMPETE WITH HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE AND NEW YORK
AND WHICH ENABLED THE BRITISH MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO FLOURISHED THEN I THINK WE WILL DO BETTER AND I THINK THERE'S EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS TO THE BDA EXPORTERS AT LEAST TO THE TO THE VALUE OF THE POUND BEING WHAT IT IS BUT THAT THIRTY ONE YELLOW I MEAN DOES THAT NOT GIVE YOU PAUSE
FRANKLY DOESN'T NOW BUT I THINK THAT THAT THEY THE THING THE POUND IS STILL TOO STRONG FOR MANUFACTURING AND THAT I THINK WE MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THERE'S SOME FIGURES GOING TO COME OUT OR TOMORROW ACTUALLY FOR THE OFFICER A NATIONAL STATISTICS SHOWING WHAT THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFICIT IS GOING TO BE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AND I SUSPECT IT'S GOING TO BE HORRIBLE AND I WOULD BE A BIT SURPRISED I THINK ACTUALLY THIS IS A MORE MAJOR ISSUE THAT THE COUNTRY'S FACING THAT ANYTHING TO DO WITH BRECHT SAID AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REACT
VERY STRONGLY TO THOSE FIGURES FOR CELIBATE WILL YOU RUN A P. A COMPANY A SMALL BUSINESS YES WHY WERE YOU FOR LEAVE WERE FUNDAMENTALLY MY MAIN ISSUE IS TALENT AND THEN I HAVE AN OFFICE IN NEW YORK AND INTO BY THE MAJORITY OF MY BUSINESS OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF MY BUSINESS COMES FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. SO I SAW THE GROWTH WITH COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA WITH INDIA I ALSO REALISES AS I TRAVELLED AROUND THE WORLD AND HAD INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS BUT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR BRITISH BUSINESS TO BRAND OF BRITAIN
AND IN MY INDUSTRY P.R. ARE SEEN AS IT'S A CENTRE THAT THEY HELD BACK BY BEING IN THE E.U. BUT I FELT AS IF THERE WAS A GLOBAL THERE WAS A NARRATIVE IN THE E.U. TO BE INWARD FACING RATHER THAN INTERNATIONAL AND I FELT IT WAS ABSURD BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE E.U. IN ITSELF IS STAGNANT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FAST GROWING ECONOMIES IN THE EAST INDIAN CHINA I THOUGHT WORRY LOOKING TOWARDS A CLOSE INTEGRATION WITH THE E.U.
PAYING FOR IT ON TOP OF THAT ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE WE OFTEN HEARD FROM SMALL BUSINESSES OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE E.U. WAS ABOUT REGULATION RED RED TAPE AS IT'S OFTEN REFER TO ARE YOU NOW HOPING THAT SOME OF THAT IS ROLLED BACK AND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ROLL BACK GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES WHAT HAVE YOU FOR INSTANCE IN WHAT I AM BUT I'M HOPING FOR ULTIMATELY IS
THE TALENT POOL SO AT THE MOMENT I WANT TO HIRE PEOPLE FROM SOUTH AFRICA I WANT TO HIDE THE FORGIVE ME IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU REGULATION SO WHAT WERE HIS OTHER OTHER SPECIFIC REGULATIONS RED TAPE YOU WERE LOOKING TO SELL I MEAN MY MAIN ISSUE IF I CAN JUST MAKE IT CLEAR IS THE FACT THAT I WANT TO RECRUIT FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. AND I FELT AS IF RECRUITING FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. IS SUCH A DISCRIMINATORY BECAUSE PEOPLE COMING FROM THE E.U. MY EMPLOYMENT LAWYER SAID OH WHY DON'T YOU JUST FOCUS ON HIRING FROM
PEOPLE FROM THE E.U. AT MY ISSUE WAS THAT I NEED TO HIRE FROM OUTSIDE AS I WASN'T ABLE TO DO SO IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION COMING IN FROM THE E.U. AND TO MEET THE NET MIGRATION FIGURES FOR THE GOVERNMENT THERE WAS THEREFORE A NEGATIVE IMPACT AND BEEN ABLE TO IN THE CREW PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. THAT WAS MY FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HOW DO YOU THINK THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER SHOULD BALANCE THE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND THEIR CONCERNS THAT MANY VOTERS HAVE HAD AND HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT IMMIGRATION
WELL I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WHERE WHERE IN THE SINGLE MARKET BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT BORDER CONTROL
AND THEREFORE I THINK THE SOLUTION IS FOR US NOT TO BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET BUT TO TRADE WITH EUROPE WE DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND IF I LET THE TARIFFS YOU DO YOU KNOW YOU HAD IT WITH TARIFFS THEIR TARIFFS ARE ONLY ABOUT THREE PERCENT OR SOMETHING ON AVERAGE AND THE PAN'S ALREADY GONE DOWN BY SOMEBODY I SAID RATE PER CENT SO YOU'RE JUST AS COMPETITIVE IF NOT MORE SO THAN WE WERE BEFORE BUT WITHOUT ALL THE BAGGAGE OF REGULATION AND CONTROL OVER BORDERS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE SINGLE MARKET BRINGS IN TRAIN THIS IS GREAT REALLY THAT IS THE BEST OUTCOME DO YOU TAKE THE SAME VIEW FOR FAISALABAD WELL ON ON ON ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET ESSENTIALLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO GET TOO HUNG UP ON WE'D BE HAPPY WOULD BE FIND OUTSIDE I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF RUNNING A BUSINESS WHERE HARDLY ANY OF MY BUSINESS CAME IN FROM THE E.U. AND SURVIVED FOCUS REALLY IS IS OUTSIDE OF THAT YOU AND I AM GLAD THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY EXITED HER THAT WE WILL BE EXITING BECAUSE I WORK WITH INDIA AND CHINA
QUITE A LOT AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE THE GROWTH AND THAT'S WHERE I SEE BRITAIN ACTUALLY BUILDING IT'S CLOSER ECONOMIC TIES WITH FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE FOR ZANNA BEDWELL AND JOHN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THANK YOU IF THE TIME NOW IS ABOUT FIVE WHAT IT IS PRECISELY ACTUALLY COMING UP TO FIVE TO NINE HERE IN BRUSSELS NOW LAST NIGHT DAVID CAMERON AFTER HIS FINAL SUMMIT DINNER BEFORE HE FLEW HOME SAID THAT BRITAIN WOULD NOT BE TURNING ITS BACK ON EUROPE THE QUESTION THOUGH IS ARE THEY BEGINNING TO TURN THEIR BACK ON US
BECAUSE WE ARE HEADING FOR THE BRICKS IT JOINT TO DISCUSS THAT BY THE BRUSSEL BUREAU CHIEF OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES ALEX PARKER AND ALSO BY ESTHER'S A LAND WHOSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE E.U. OBSERVER AN ONLINE NEWSPAPER MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU
VERY SIGNIFICANT MOMENT THIS MORNING ALEX IS IT NOT WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER IS NOT HERE HE'S GONE HOME AND TWENTY SEVEN LEADERS MEET WITHOUT IT
REALLY BE IN NO DOUBT OF WHAT AN IMPORTANT MOMENT THIS IS IT BLEEDERS HAVE MISSED SUMMITS BEFORE BUT THAT'S BEEN FOR ILLNESS OR WHATEVER BUT YOU'VE NEVER HAD A SITUATION WHERE TWENTY SEVEN ARE GETTING TOGETHER TO PLOT AGAINST THEM EFFECTIVELY AND THIS IS THE SEPARATION HAPPENING BEFORE A DIVORCE BEFORE OUR EYES BEFORE LEGALLY ACTUALLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED THEY CALL IT INFORMAL FOR THAT REASON IT'S NOT REALLY LEGALLY ALLOWED FOR THEM TO GET TOGETHER IN THIS WAY BUT BRITAIN IS SLOWLY BEING DEFINED AS THE UPPER
IS DAVID CAMERON FOUND WHEN HE TRIED TO STOP ME DON'T JUMP YOUNGER BECOMING EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT IT'S GOT QUITE A GALVANISING EFFECT AND I'M MET THEM AND THE PLOT OF USE YOU DESCRIBE IT HE'S SAYING WHAT IS A COMMON NEGOTIATING POSITION TO BE TOUGH WITH WHOEVER IS DAVID CAMERON SUCCESSOR INDEED THEY'RE LAYING DOWN THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THIS NEGOTIATION
THAT'S PART OF IT I THINK THAT'S PART OF SEWING UNITY I'M ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH SAYING THIS STAND OUT IT WON'T BE A CONTAGION AND PUTTING FORWARD PERHAPS IDEAS OF HOW YOU CAN BE REFORMED HOW MUCH FEAR OF CONTAGION AS IT'S CALLED IN THIS CITY IS THERE IN OTHER WORDS THE IDEA THERE'LL BE OTHER POPULIST MOVEMENTS IN YOUR OWN HOME COUNTRY AND HUNGRY THERE IS A REFERENDUM AS IT HAPPENS IT'S ALL MIGRATION QUOTAS ISN'T IT BUT IT'S
OPPORTUNITY ONE OF MANY IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AT THE BALLOT BOX FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S TO SHOW THEIR ANGER WITH BRUSSELS I THINK THERE'S A REAL RISK OF CONTAGION I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THE U.K. REFERENDUM IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LEFT OUT OF GLOBALISATION AND THEY'RE FALLING BEHIND AND THERE ARE WORDS ARE NOT BEING LISTENED TO EITHER BY BRUSSELS OR BY THE CAPITAL BUT IF YOU WERE LOOKING AS YOU DO PROFESSIONALLY EVERY DAY IN THIS CITY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SIGN THAT THEY GET IT ALEX PARKER IN OTHER WORDS THAT THEY ARE CHANGING
WHAT THEY DO IN RESPONSE TO WHAT PEOPLE WOULD OFTEN CALL DEMOCRACY RATHER THAN CONTAGION IS THERE A SIGN YOU'RE HERE A LOT OF BOILER PLATE TALK ABOUT HAVING TO RETHINK AND RECONNECT WITH VOTERS AND DELIVER AND ACTUALLY THE MOST INTERESTING AND I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IS THAT LEADERS ARE SEEING THE KIND OF HUGE IMPACT AND THE TURMOIL IN THE U.K. AND THINKING
GOD THIS IS A BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY YOU'VE HAD FRANCOIS LONG IN FRANCE MARK WRITTEN IN THE NETHERLANDS PINNED DOWN BY ANTI E.U. ANTI ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS AND SUDDENLY THIS BREAK IS THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW BUT THERE'S A COST TO THERE SO ANOTHER IS THAT EXTRAORDINARY LANGUAGE WE HEARD FROM THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER IN WHICH HE SAID HE ENGLAND WAS BROKEN
POLITICALLY ECONOMICALLY CONSTITUTION APART FROM THE B. B. C. O. K. N. HE'S WAGGING HIS FINGER AT HIS ELECTORATE SAYING CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR AND I DON'T KNOW HE'S ELECTRA DORSAL TO FRANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE PROPOLIS PARTIES ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR A REFERENDUM OR LEAVING TO YOU AND PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WHETHER THERE COULD BE MAYBE NOT NOW IN THE FUTURE SOME SORT OF DEAL WHERE BRITAIN GET SOME ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND GET SOME SORT OF LIMITATION TO FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
AGAIN AND AGAIN WE'RE HEARING PEOPLE ESTHER'S SAYING NO DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY GO ON HAVE IT NOW THAT'S GONNA BE THAT'S GOING TO BE THEIR MAIN MANIA SURE DO NEGOTIATIONS I THINK YOU WEE OUT YESTERDAY FROM JUNGLE LINK YOUR UNCLE AND OTHER LEADERS THAT IS VERY STRONG ON THAT POSITION IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR SINGLE MARKER DO NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF
A LEVEL OF FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT DO WE THINK IT MAY BE IN TWO YEARS AFTER THEY FACED THEIR OWN ELECTORATES THAT FIND THE DEAL COS THEY'VE GOT EVEN BEFORE THE VOTE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF WISE OLD OWLS AROUND TOWN WHO SAID WELL YOU KNOW THEY CAN VOTE ALBERT THIS CAN CHANGE THEIR ELECTIONS TIME MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE I THINK ONE CLEAR THAT'S THE ONE THING IS BECOMING CLEAR IS THAT
THEY WANT TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN TERMS THEY WANTED ARTICLE FIFTY THEY WANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF THAT PROCESS AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE A DEAL TOO EARLY BUT THE PRIME MINISTER EARLY A LAST THOUGHT TO BOTH OF YOU I'VE BEEN COMING TO THE SUMMITS FOR YEARS YOU COVER THE SUMMITS ALL THE TIME I'M STRUCK BY THE EMOTION YEAH ESTHER
LOOKING AT THE PRIME MINISTER YESTERDAY HE WAS A SAD MAN THERE AND THEY'RE A LOT OF PEOPLE I WAS IN THE COMMISSION YESTERDAY WHO SEEM EQUALLY SAD YEAH IT WAS IT WAS A VERY SAD MOMENT AND GENTLE MIRACLE SAID ALSO THAT IN THE ROOM EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT AND SAD MOMENT I HAVE TO SAY I'M ON JOURNALIST OURSELVES WE'RE SORT OF
