ALL COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS WORLDWIDE OF THE TYPE OF AIRBUS HELICOPTER INVOLVED IN A FATAL CRASH IN NORWAY YESTERDAY HAVE BEEN GROUNDED THE SUPER PUMA CAME DOWN IN THE NORTH SEA NEAR THE CITY OF BERGEN AND IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN OIL PLATFORM OR THIRTEEN PEOPLE ON BOARD INCLUDING A BRITISH MEN WERE KILLED OR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT REPORTS
A SIGNIFICANT CLUE HAS EMERGED AS SOME WHY THIS HELICOPTER CRASHED IT'S AN AMATEUR VIDEOS SHOWING THE ROTOR BLADES CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BODY OF THE HELICOPTER GENTLY CIRCLING THEIR WAY TO EARTH AS THE CAMERA PANS AROUND YOU SEE BLACK SMOKE THE AIRCRAFT HAS ALREADY HIT THE GROUND
DATA SHOWS IT FELL MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FEET IN JUST TEN SECONDS INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOW FOUND THE BLACK BOX WHICH RECORDS WHAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS DOING AND WHAT THE PILOTS WERE SAYING THEY ARE BUILT TO WITHSTAND CRASHES BUT THIS WAS A VERY HEAVY IMPACT SO IT MAY BE BADLY DAMAGED
THE SAME TYPE OF HELICOPTER AND E. C. TWO TO FIVE HAS HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE THE MODEL WAS IN EFFECT GROUNDED FOR A FEW MONTHS IN TWENTY TWELVE AFTER DITCHING TWICE IN THE NORTH SEA WITH GEARBOX PROBLEMS ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS KILLED
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES HAVE ANNOUNCED A TRUCE IN TWO AREAS OF THE COUNTRY IT SAYS IS AIMED AT SALVAGING THE U.N. BACKED CEASEFIRE HAS BEEN ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE IN RECENT DAYS THE TRUCE EXCLUDES THE CITY OF ALEPPO WHERE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS WEEK OUR CORRESPONDENT REPORTS FROM BEIRUT
UNDER THE NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE SYRIAN ARMY SAYS IT WILL OBSERVE WHAT IT CALLED A REGIME OF CALM FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE DAMASCUS AREA FOR THREE DAYS IN THE COASTAL LATTER AKIO PROVINCE
IT'S AT THE GOAL WAS TO DEPRIVE THE REBELS OR TERRORISTS AS IT CALLED THEM OF A PRETEXT FOR HITTING CIVILIAN TARGETS AND TO BOLSTER THE EXISTING CEASEFIRE WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT TWO MONTHS AGO THE AMERICANS ARE HOPING THAT IT WILL CALM HOSTILITIES IN THOSE AREAS THAT THE PROCESS COULD BE EXTENDED TO THE BIGGEST CURRENT TROUBLE SPOT ALEPPO WHICH THE RUSSIANS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE REFUSED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR LATEST TRUCE
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST EIGHT DAYS OF DEEPENING VIOLENCE THERE THAT'S RAISED FEARS OF A LONG AND BITTER NEW BOUT OF HOSTILITIES WHICH WOULD DESTROY ANY HOPE OF A RETURN TO PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND GENEVA
THE NEW LEADER OF THE HEAD TEACHERS' UNION HAS WARNED THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST RUSHING AHEAD WITH PLANS TO FORCE ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TO BECOME ACADEMIES OUTSIDE LOCAL AUTHORITY CONTROL KYM JOHNSON THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS SAYS IT WILL COST MONEY THAT COULD BE SPENT IN CLASSROOMS IT OCCASION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN IS EXPECTED TO DEFEND THEIR PLANS AT THEIR CONFERENCE THIS MORNING EDUCATION EDITOR WHEN JEFFREY'S REPORTS FROM BIRMINGHAM
KYM JOHNSON IS THE HEAD TEACHER OF AN ACADEMY SCHOOL AND SAYS HE'S HAPPY TO PERSUADE FELLOW TEACHERS OF THE BENEFITS BUT HE ARGUES NO SCHOOL SHOULD BE FORCED TO CONVERT TO AN ACADEMY THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE N. A. H. T. ONE SMALLER SCHOOLS COULD SUFFER AND SAYS THE BENEFITS OVERALL ARE UNCERTAIN HE'S CALLED ON MICKEY MORGAN TO EXPLAIN HOW THE CHANGE WILL BENEFIT CHILDREN WHEN SHE SPEAKS TO HER TEACHERS AT THE CONFERENCE TODAY
THE EDUCATION SECRETARY HAS ARGUED AND ALL ACADEMY SYSTEM AND ENGLAND WOULD BE MORE CONSISTENT AND DELIVER FREEDOM SCHOOLS NEED TO IMPROVE UNDER THEIR PLANS LOCAL COUNCILS WOULD NO LONGER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN ANY SCHOOL THE SCALE AND SPEED OF THE CHANGE OF PROVOKED OPPOSITION FROM SOME CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AND COUNCILLORS
USING A MOBILE PHONE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD GET SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER FRONT TODAY FURTHER CAMPS ARE BEING MADE TO ROAMING CHARGES AHEAD OF A FULL BAND NEXT JUNE EXTRA CHARGES FOR DOWNLOADING DATA WILL TYPICALLY DROP FROM SEVENTEEN PENCE PER MEGABYTE TO FOUR PENCE INCLUDING V.A.T. WITH ROAMING CHARGES WERE CALLS CAPPED AT FOUR PENCE PER MINUTE THE DIGITAL ECONOMY MINISTER ED VAIZEY SPELLED OUT THE BENEFITS
ROUGHLY A MILLION BRITS STAY THE NIGHT IN EUROPE EVERY DAY
THEY SPEND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION A YEAR
ON EXTRA ROAMING CHARGES SO BY REDUCING THESE CHARGES WE'RE GOING TO SAY BRITISH CONSUMERS MILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR RESCUERS IN THE KENYAN CAPITAL NAIROBI ARE SEARCHING FOR DOZENS OF PEOPLE FEAR TRAPPED AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF A SEVEN STOREY BUILDING THE APARTMENT BLOCK CAME DOWN AFTER HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING FORTY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY BEEN PULLED ALIVE FROM THE RUBBLE
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT INCREASING BOUTS OF DEPRESSION IN OLDER PEOPLE ARE LINKED TO A HIGHER RISK OF DEVELOPING DEMENTIA FIRST EVER LONG TERM STUDY INTO THE ISSUE REPORTED IN THE MEDICAL JOURNAL THE LANCET PSYCHIATRY SUGGESTS SUCH A PATTERN OF DEPRESSION COULD BE AN EARLY WARNING SIGN IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC HUGHES
RESEARCHERS STUDIED DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEPRESSION IN A GROUP OF MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED LOW BUT STABLE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AROUND TEN PER CENT WENT ON TO DEVELOP DEMENTIA THE RISK WAS NO GREATER FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION BUT IN THE GROUP THAT SAW EPISODES OF DEPRESSION INCREASING OVER TIME THE RISK WAS MUCH HIGHER WITH MORE THAN ONE IN FIVE OF THE GROUP EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING DEMENTIA
THE AUTHORS SAY THIS SUPPORTS THE THEORY BUT INCREASING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN OLDER PEOPLE COULD BE AN EARLY STAGE OF DEMENTIA AND THE DEMENTIA AND SOME FORMS OF DEPRESSION MAYBE SYMPTOMS OF A COMMON UNDERLYING CAUSE
THE STUDENT IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DISCOVERED A HUGE ARCHIVE OF JOURNALISM BY THE CELEBRATED NINETEENTH CENTURY POET WALT WHITMAN THE WEEKLY SERIES ON MANLY HEALTH WAS PUBLISHED IN AN OBSCURE NEWSPAPER AND HAD BEEN LOST FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IN A DIGITAL ARCHIVE BY THE STUDENT WHO RECOGNISED A SUITED HIM USED BY WHITMAN

THEY COULD ALL LEAVE AND THEY COULD ALL LEAVE BUT THEY CHOOSE TO STAY THEY CHOOSE TO STAY BECAUSE OF HIPPOCRATIC OATH THAT THEY'VE TAKEN THEY'RE THERE TO HELP PEOPLE AND THEY THEN THEY'RE JUST STAYING ALL THE TIME MEAN I'M IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THEM NOW ON VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA TO SEE IF THEY'RE O.K. AND IT'S IT'S PITIFUL TO HEAR THEM
SUFFERING FROM THE ATTACKS THAT THEY'RE GETTING AT THE MOMENT WHAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST RECENT CONTACTS YOU'VE HAD THEM WITH PEOPLE IN IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS KILLED YESTERDAY I MEAN I I WHAT'S THAT A FRIEND OF MINE YESTERDAY AND SAID ARE YOU O.K. HE DIDN'T REPLY BACK TILL LATE ON LAST NIGHT SAYING WELL IT'S TERRIBLE BUT WE'RE STILL O.K. AND THAT'S IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE I WORKED WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED METRES FROM THE HOSPITAL
WHICH WAS ATTACKED RECENTLY AND I'M JUST DESPERATE TO THINK THAT THEN THAT HOSPITAL NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ATTACKED BECAUSE THEY'RE SO IT'S A SYSTEMATIC TARGETING OF ALL THE DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND EVERYTHING SO SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT SURELY SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT IT NOW WELL WHAT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT IS THE QUESTION ISN'T IT THAT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS STAGES WHERE SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT SYRIA BUT THOSE STAGES HAVE ALL BEEN
FAST HAVEN'T THEY THE RUSSIANS WHO ARE SUPPORTING OUR SENT FORCES IN DOING THESE THINGS ARE VERY MUCH IN CONTROL THERE AND THAT'S BEEN ON IN A SENSE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE WASN'T IT FROM THE WEST WELL IT HAS BEEN BUT NOW YOU KNOW IT HAS TO STOP NOW THIS IS RIDICULOUS IT'S GOT ON AND ON FOR FIVE YEARS THE DOCTOR'S I WORKING WITH THAT I WAS WORKING WITH HAVE BEEN THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR FIVE YEARS
YESTERDAY THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS AND THE M.S.F. PRESIDENT'S GOT TOGETHER AND SAID THERE MUST BE SOME U.N. DELEGATION OR U.N. MANDATE TO TRY AND STOP THIS BUT THE U.N. HAVE DONE VERY LITTLE I THINK IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SO YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO EVERYBODY SAYING O.K. THE VACILLATING ON THEIR IDEA THAT PETE
BUT ASAD SHOULD STAY IN IN POWER IT'S NONSENSE I SAID SHOULD GO HE IS THE CULPRIT OF ALL THESE MURDERS I MEAN BASICALLY MURDERERS AND IN SUITS AND NOBODY CAN REALLY DO THAT NOBODY CAN REALLY SEE EXACTLY WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THE CHANCES OF GETTING RID OF HIM NOW THERE WERE CHANCES IN THE PAST AND OF COURSE WHEN HE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND PRESIDENT OBAMA
THREATENED HIM AND SAID THAT WAS A RED LION BUT THEN DID NOTHING AND INDEED THERE WAS A VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND BRITAIN DECIDED NOT TO ATTACK UNTIL YOU LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE BIN DO YOU LOOK BACK ON THOSE THINGS AND SAY ACTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE ACTED THEN ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THE PROBLEM WAS LEADERSHIP LEADERSHIP FROM THE HIGH YOU KNOW AMERICA U.K. EVERYBODY THERE WAS LACK OF LEADERSHIP BECAUSE NOBODY REALLY KNEW WHAT TO DO BUT NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU CAN SEE IT'S A LOT IT'S A GENOCIDE OF OF THAT
I MEAN THE PEOPLE ARE IN A LEPER AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NORMAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I GOING ABOUT THEIR WORK THEN THEY'RE NOT WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS THEY ARE ARMED GANGS OF PEOPLE ROAMING AROUND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST CIVILIANS AND THE DOCTORS THERE ARE ALSO BILLIONS YEAH COS I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT A LEOPARD SO YOU WERE THERE IN WHAT TWENTY FOURTEEN YES JUST GIVE US A SORT OF SENSE
OF THE CITY WHEN IT FUNCTIONS RELATIVELY NORMALLY WHO'S DOWN WHAT WHEN I WAS DOWN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS WELL AND IT WAS FUNCTIONING MUCH BETTER THAN IT DID TWO IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WAS A RELATIVELY NORMAL CITY THERE WAS LOTS OF SNIPER ATTACKS GOING ROUND AND WE HAD EVERY DAY BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE SUB SNIPER ATTACKS LITTLE HOSPITAL
WHICH WE WERE DEALING WITH IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT WAS MUCH WORSE THAN THAT IT WAS SIGNIFICANT BOMBING AERIAL BOMBING BARRELLED BOMBING AND THE WHOLE PLACE WAS WAS REALLY TRIED TO BE FLATTENED BY BY ALL THESE BARREL BOMBS AND SO IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE LEFT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY UNDER A REGIME THAT IS
FIRING BARREL BOMBS ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW NOBODY'S GOING TO LIVE NOBODY'S GOING TO SIT THERE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE HE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAVEN'T THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING IN A WAY THAT THERE ARE STILL POOR ORDINARY CIVILIANS THERE WELL THERE ARE THERE ARE ALL THE MISSING THIS TORTURE WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY ARE UNDERGOING A TORCH WHEN I WAS THERE YOU THINK THE WHOLE PLACE IS FULL OF EXTREMISM IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT AND IN FACT I WAS
ON THE ON IN ALEPPO CITY WHERE I VISITED THERE WAS A CATHOLIC CHURCH RUN BY NUNS AND RUN BY A PRIEST AND IN FACT THAT POOR PRIEST ALSO GOT KILLED BY A BARREL BOMB AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO AND HE WAS A LOVELY GUY AND EVERYBODY LOOKS AFTER EACH OTHER PEOPLE READ LOOK AT THIS AND THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO STOP NOW DAVID NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED OF
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TURN EVERY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND INTO AN ACADEMY IT'S MEETING A LOT OF OPPOSITION SO THE EDUCATION SECRETARY MICKEY MORGAN MAY GET A ROUGH RIDE WHEN SHE TALKS AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS TODAY WHILE I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY KIM JOHNSON WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THAT ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU'VE RUN AN ACADEMY YOURSELF I HAVE INDEED YES AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT
THE SYSTEM I MEAN IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR US WE MADE THE DECISION BECAUSE WE FELT THAT OUR LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD NOTHING REALLY TO OFFER US WITH REGARD SCHOOL IMPROVEMENTS AND FURTHER DEVELOPING OUR CURRICULUM AND INDEED MAKING THE THE JOBS OF THE THE STAFF SECURE SO IT WAS IT WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR US BUT YOU WON'T BE SAYING TODAY TO THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NOR AS I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECT ME IF I'M ON WILL YOUR ASSOCIATION THIS IS A GOOD POLICY TO MAKE THEM ALL ACADEMIES
OUR VIEW IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ACADEMY IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS WITH SCHOOLS BEING FORCED TO BECOME ACADEMIES PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'VE GOT SO MANY OF THEM THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOOD AND OUTSTANDING AND THE STUDENTS AT THE PUPILS THAT WERE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND SO TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AND DEED AND INDEED COULD BE AND USE OF MONEY THAT COULD BE SPENT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CLASSROOM BEING SPENT ON MAKING THAT CONVERSION OCCURRED WHY WOULD IT COST A LOT OF MONEY TO TURN A SCHOOL INTO AN ACADEMY
THIS THIS IS A STRUCTURAL CHANGE THAT OCCURS WITH REGARD THE GOVERNMENTS AND HIS MONEY THAT'S PUT ASIDE ACTUALLY TO ALLOW THAT TO TAKE PLACE I REMEMBER WHEN WE CONVERTED THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WAS IMPLICIT ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE FOR FOR MY BUSINESS MANAGER AND MY AND TO THE TEAM IN THE OFFICE WAS WAS CONSIDERABLE BUT IN THE END AND I KNOW IT'S A CLICHED FORGIVE ME BUT THERE IT IS THE SCHOOLS EXIST TO SERVE THE CHILDREN IN THEM IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF
BUT IN AN ACADEMY RATHER THAN A STATE RUN SCHOOL THEN THE CHANGE SHOULD BE NURTURED
THE POINT THAT YOU MAKE IS IF IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF IN THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY BE BETTER OFF AND I CAN THINK OF EXAMPLES CLEARLY WE HAVE GOT COLLEAGUES WERE RUNNING ACADEMIES AND THEY'VE BEEN RUN VERY WELL AND INDEED THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS GOOD AND PROBABLY HAS IMPROVED BUT INDEED LACQUER LIKE I SAID BEFORE THERE ARE MANY MANY SCHOOLS ARE GOOD AND OUTSTANDING THAT WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FRAMEWORK SO THAT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IMPLICITLY YES THAT'S YOU ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT
SOME OF THE SMALLER SCHOOLS BEING TURNED INTO CABINET YES I THINK BACK TO MY CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE AT SCHOOL THEY WERE IN THE SCHOOL OF TWENTY ONE PEOPLE'S ALTOGETHER THE WHOLE OF THE THE PRIMARY SCHOOL IT WAS VERY MUCH A HUB OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY
AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT IF SOME OF THOSE SMALLER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY ARE TAKEN ON BY ACADEMIES WHETHER BECAUSE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE THEY WILL THEY WILL DISAPPEAR AND AS SUCH THAT THE IMPACT ADVERSELY ON THE ON THE COMMUNITY AND A GAME WHERE YOU'VE GOT A FINE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS TAKING PLACE IN THOSE SCHOOLS WHY CHANGE IT GO BACK TO YOUR STATEMENT I'M TO GO AND WHO HE BROKE DON'T FIX IT SO ARE YOU SAYING AT THE MOMENT THE STANDARD OF OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS THE BOARD IS PRETTY GOOD AND WE SHOULD PRETTY MUCH LEAVE THINGS AS THEY ARE
I'M NOT SAYING LEAVE IT LEAVE IT AS THEY ARE THERE ARE THERE THERE'S CERTAINLY A CASE FOR WHERE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES WANT TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO ACADEMIES OR JOIN MULTI ACADEMY TRUSTS TO ACTUALLY RAISE THE STANDARDS AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY THAT THEY CAN DO IT AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE BUT WHERE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME ARE WORKING WITHIN A FRAME MIGHT BE THAT IN A FEDERATION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACADEMIES BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF DOING THIS SCHOOLS AT WORK WITHIN LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT CAN SUPPORT THEM THEN WHY CHANGE THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY WORKING IN FEDERATIONS
WHETHER WITH IS THAT KAL EEJIT APPROACH AND ALL THE THEMES ARE IMPLICIT IN SCHOOL IMPROVEMENTS IN RAISING OF STANDARD SO THEY'RE WHY CHANGE THAT IT IT REALLY DOES SEAL I SAID YESTERDAY MY SPEECH IT SEEMS RATHER ODD THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ANYTHING ELSE IN CONSERVATIVE POLICY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT MIXED ECONOMY AND THAT DIVERSITY WITH EDUCATION IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL
KYM JOHNSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THAT TYNE EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LABOURS INQUIRY INTO ANTI CEMETERIES AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE TWO MONTHS IT WILL BE CHAIRED BY ASTRONOMY SSH ACCRA BART. THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF LIBERTY TOM BATEMAN A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS HERE AND DO WE KNOW HOW SHE'S GOING TO
WHAT WE DO THERE ARE TWO THINGS GOING ON READY BECAUSE THERE'S THIS INQUIRY BY CHECKER BART. THERE IS ALSO IN THE MEANTIME JEREMY CORBIN GOING TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND SAYING THAT HE IS GONNA PROPOSE A BRAND NEW CODE OF CONDUCT IN THE INTERIM IN TERMS OF THE THIS REVIEW THIS INQUIRY IT SEEMS QUITE LOOSE IN THE SENSE THAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT OF JAMMY CORBETT IS TALK ABOUT HER
CONSULTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND AND OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN COMING BACK WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS NOW INTRIGUINGLY THESE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR M.P.S SO THIS IS CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT BY JEREMY CORBIN TO PUT A LID ON THIS AND TO SAY I AM DEALING WITH IT GIVEN THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DIRECT CRITICISM ALL WEEK THAT HE'S FAILED
QUICKLY ENOUGH AND HARD ENOUGH TO GET A HANDLE ON WE TALK TO JONATHAN A CRUSH THE PRESIDENT BOARD OF DEPUTIES BRITISH JEWS MUN THINGS HE SAID AS A MISTER WHEN HIMSELF OUGHT TO LOOK TO HIMSELF HE HE SUGGESTS MISTER CORBIN HAS CONTACTS WITH ANTI SEAMOUNTS THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE SHARES PLATFORMS WITH ISLAMISTS AND THAT THAT ACTUALLY HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT STOPS US WHEN HE DIRECTLY CALLED FOUR DID YOU GET ANY SENSE THAT THAT THAT IS PART OF THIS INQUIRY
THAT WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION AND CERTAINLY I THINK IN THE BACKGROUND OF SOME OF MY KEY DETRACTORS THAT IS CLEARLY THE SUBTEXT FOR WHAT YOU'VE HAD SO FAR AT LEAST PUBLICLY IS THE USE OF KEN LIVINGSTONE IS THE KIND OF PROXY
AS THE WAY TO GET IT JEREMY CORBIN OVER AND IT'S NOT JUST ON THE LEADERSHIP ISSUE MOTHER HE'S GOT A GRIP ON IT BUT ALSO AS YOU SAY THAT THAT SORT OF SUBTEXT BUT HE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER HIMSELF AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GETTING NOW IS BY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COMING OUT INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET LIKE CRISP RIGHT AND OTHERS CALLING FOR THE EXPULSION OF KEN LIVINGSTON YOU THEN GET A CONDITION PLACED ON CHEMICAL WINS LEADERSHIP IN THE SENSE THAT THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS
COMPLETELY BINARY DECISION TO MAKE REALLY EITHER THEY EXPEL HIM OR THEY DON'T SO ONCE YOU REACH THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THEN THE POTENTIAL OF ALL OF THIS TO COME BACK AND CREATE MORE PROBLEMS FOR JEREMY CALLING THAT'S OUTSIDE REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE SHAMMY SHAKA BART.
INVESTIGATION AND I'VE GOT OF COURSE THIS WEEK WE HAVE ALL THIS THURSDAY COMING WE HAVE LOCAL ELECTIONS IN ENGLAND ELECTIONS IN SCOTLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND AND THERE ARE BIG FEARS THE PARTY ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH THE RESULTS WE HAD THE SCENE YESTERDAY WHICH EMMA CORGAN COULDN'T GO TO WALES BECAUSE THEY FELT THERE THAT HE WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THE CAMPAIGN HE'S SANE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO THE GUARDIAN LAST NIGHT SAYING HE'S NOT GONNA ACCEPT ARBITRARY MEASURES OF SUCCESS ON THE ELECTION RESULTS AND IN TERMS THAT LEADERSHIP QUESTION HE SAYS HE'S KEEPING GOING
I'LL MAKE THEM THANKS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW HERE'S AN INTERESTING CHALLENGE IF YOU COULD PICK A FILM FROM MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT YOU'D MOST LIKE TO SEE RESTORED AND DIGITISE WHAT WOULD IT BE WELL THERE HAS INDEED BEEN A VOTE ONLINE FORD JUST THAT AND HE IS THE WINNER
THE BARONESS WHO HAS JUST ASKED HIM TO GIVE HER GRANDSON ARRIBA LEFT ALREADY HAS TWO BOYS IN THE SCHOOL AND I MYSELF HAVE CERTAIN OBBLY
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I PUT IT TO YOU BUT I WILL NOT BE SURPRISED
IF THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT MISTAKE
BUT HIDDEN PAST THE MUGS THAT DAY HEAVY IN THIS BOOK THE MARKS THE DATE GAVE TO THE BOY
MY BILL POWERS DON'T YOU SEE THAT THAT'S IMPOSS
ENGLISH NOT ARITHMETIC NOT THIS DID YOU WANT HER GOT NO
PLEASE LOOK MORE CLOSELY MISTER AFFAIRS LOOK MORE CLOSELY CAN'T YOU SEE IN ME MISTAKE
MISTER TOO AS MADE IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE STARTING THE GREET PETER SELLERS WHY THAT ONE WELL JOE BOTTING HE'S FIXING CURATOR AT THE B.F.I. NATIONAL ARCHIVE GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT'S A GOOD
IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING FILM AND I THINK WHAT CATCHES PEOPLE'S ATTENTION IS THAT IT IT'S THE SELLER'S FILM SELLERS FANS WE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
OFF THE RADAR FOR SO LONG THEY GOT RELEASED TWO REASONABLE REVIEWS BUT IT JUST SANK WITHOUT TRACE AFTER THEY DIDN'T IT BECAUSE I HAD TO SAY WHA WHAT WAS THAT A SORT OF MIKE LEIGH WELL IS BASED ON A MARCEL PAGNOL PLAY HIM IT'S A VERY FAMOUS STORY A NICE STORY THE SCHOOLTEACHER UNASSUMING SCHOOLTEACHER WHO AREN'T ENDS UP NOBODY GOT FIRED DIDN'T DIE AND THEN HE ENDED UP BECOMING RATHER RAPACIOUS FINANCE HERE ABSOLUTELY A PARABLE FOR A THAI PARABLES WERE QUITE IN A WAY BUT THAT THIS BUSINESS OF
RESTORING FILMS NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS COS YOU CAN'T IMPROVE ON THE ORIGINAL CAMEO WELL THERE ARE WAYS NOW TO DO THAT IN THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN TO CHEMICALLY I.E. GOING TO FILM AGAIN FROM FILM SO YOU GO BACK TO THE NEGATIVE WELL THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS CASE THE NEGATIVE DIDN'T EXIST SO THEY HAVE NEGATIVE IS HE'S LOST AS FAR AS WE KNOW WE HAVE PRINCE IN THE ARCHIVES THAT HAVE BEEN WITH US SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
SO WE HAVE BEEN PRESERVING THAT MATERIAL AND THANK GOODNESS THAT THAT IT CAME TO US AND I THOUGHT HE WERE COLOURED VERY FADED QUITE QUITE BADLY SO IT WAS VERY PINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE PINK DYE DEVISED BETTER THAN THE OTHERS AND YOU'RE GOING TO RESTORE THE OLD COLOURS ONCE IT'S BEEN DIGITISED THEN THEY CAN WORK SOME MAGIC AND THEY CAN BRING THE COLOUR BACK BUT IS THAT CHEATING IT UP IN A CHEAP STUPID WOOD TO USE ISN'T IT DOES IT IS IT IS IT
AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF WHAT THE FILM SHOULD THAT'S VERY HARD TO SAY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A HOBBY TO COMPARE IT TO BUT WE CAN DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY CAN ACTUALLY TRY AND RESTORE THE COLOURS AS MUCH AS HE AS THEY THINK HE'S IS CORRECT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WHAT WHY BECAUSE WHY DO IT NOW BECAUSE ENDLESS FILMS GO TO DIGITAL NOW WE COULD WE COULD GET C.D.S WE GET ON LET FIX OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE WHY WOULD WE NEED TO DO THIS
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THEM NOW THAT'S THE WAY PEOPLE WATCH FILMS OBVIOUSLY MAKING NEW PRINCES IS KIND OF REDUNDANT NOW BECAUSE MY CINEMAS DON'T PROJECT THIRTY FIVE MILLIMETRE FILM THEY DON'T KNOW THEY DIGITAL IS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WATCH FILMS NOW AND THE WONDERFUL THING IS YOU CAN PROJECT ON A SCREEN YOU CAN WATCH ON YOUR COMPUTER OR DEVICE WHAT AT THE B.F.I. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO DIGITISE AS MANY OF THESE FILMS THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE SO THAT
THE HISTORY OF BRITISH CINEMA IS IS NO LONGER ONLY THOSE GREAT CLASSICS THAT WE ALL DID JUST A VERY QUICK AND CAN YOU MAKE BLACK AND WHITE FILMS COLOUR AND SHOULD YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY YES BUT THAT SOMEHOW THAT WAS VERY MUCH FROWNED UPON IN POINT COMMUNITY HE IS HE'S ABSOLUTELY JOE BOTTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN AND GARY IS HERE WITH THE SPORT YOU'D USE OF WATCH JOHN ON TELEVISION I WAS LIKE A BIG BLACK AND WHITE GOOD ME AND HER COULD YOU MAKE AND COLOUR LOOK AT HIS LITTLE CANE AND HIS BOWLER

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE LAST YEAR THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS WAITING FOR A COUNCIL HOUSE IN LONDON SOME COUNCILS HAVE STOPPED PRETENDING THAT THEY CAN MEET DEMAND
THIS IS WHAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU CALL THE HOUSING ADVICE LINE IN ISLINGTON
AWARE THAT ONLY SIX PERCENT OF THE TWENTIES ALBUM HOUSEHOLD WHEN A HOUSE IN REGISTER HOUSE LAST YEAR SOME BLAME THE SHORTAGE ON RIGHT TO BUY THEIR SELLING OFF OF COUNCIL PROPERTIES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT NOW WANTS TO EXTEND TO HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS JUST TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SAD SO THERE'S MY MAN CAVE DAVID FROM ARIZONA IS A FINANCIAL ANALYST OR QUANT AS THEY CALL THEM IN AMERICA AND HE OFTEN WORKS FROM HIS GARDEN SHED DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST QUANT ON THIS ESTATE

THAT WAS ZOE REPORT REPORTING THOUGH AND IRELAND LONDON POLITICAL EDDA IS TIM DONOVAN TIM THIS IS A BIG ISSUE RENTAL ISN'T IT
AND IN SIMPLE TERMS AS A TRADE OFF HERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN IMPOSE CONTROLS ON RENT AND TRIED TO INTERVENE YOU HAVE BEEN STUDIES ABOUT THIS FAIRLY RECENTLY BUT IT'S LIKELY TO LEAD TO FEWER LANDLORD'S COMING INTO THE SECTOR AND A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY HIM AND THAT'S A REALITY AND LONDONERS HAVE HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR IN PARTICULAR THIRTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE IT'S ESTIMATED A THIRD USE IT PARTLY A REFLECTION OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE RENTED HOMES ON PUBLIC LAND AND SO ON SUBSIDISED HOUSING
BUT ALSO A RESULT OF THE ROCKETING PRICES AND IS THAT A BIG ISSUE IN THE ELECTION BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANT TO SELL OFF SOME HOUSING ASSOCIATION PROPERTY AND THOSE WHO DON'T
WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CITY CAN'T FOR LABOUR AND ZAC GOLDSMITH OF THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE ON THIS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF APPROACH GENERALLY TO THIS SETTEE CALM MUCH MORE INTERVENTIONIST WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CATEGORY OF LIVING RENT HELD AT ABOUT A THIRD OF OF LOCAL INCOME IN SOME AREAS THAT GOLDSMITH IT'S CLEARLY DOESN'T WANT TARGETS HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THIS INTO INTERFERENCE TOO MUCH BECAUSE THE REASONS WE GIVE IT WILL EFFECT A SUPPLY BUT HE'S INTERESTED IN PARTICULAR IN EXPLORING
BUILD TO RENT GETTING MORE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS PENSION FUNDS AND SO ON INTO THE SECTOR AND THEN GUARANTEEING RENTS BELOW MARKET RATES THERE AND LONGER TENANCIES AND SO ON RIGHT THE OTHER BIG ISSUE WHO IS OF COURSE RACE IN THE ELECTION AND WHAT HAPPENED WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE LABOUR PARTY WILL BE HAVING AN IMPACT IDEA SOON
FRACTIOUS TO SAY THE LEAST SOME WOULD SAY TOXIC WOULDN'T THEY AND SLEEP GONE FOUND HIMSELF THE LABOUR CANDIDATE PULLED RIGHT INTO THAT ROW OVER KEN LIVINGSTONE'S REMARKS BECAUSE
WITH A WEEK TO GO A LIVINGSTON HAVING WARMLY ENDORSE A CANDIDATE AND CON WAS IT HAS TO BE SAID ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO CALL FOR ACTION YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO DUE PROCESS HE SAID THAT KEN LIVINGSTONE SHOULD QUOTE BE KICKED OUT OF THE PARTY SO YOU MOVE QUICKLY TO DISTANCE MYSELF BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES
BORIS JOHNSON ACTUALLY TRIED TO LINK SAID THERE WAS A CONTINUUM A LINKING KEN LIVINGSTON THROUGH JEREMY CORBIN TO SETTEE ON A VIRULENT STRAIN OF ANTI CEMETERIES AND SILLY
TEAM HAVE A FEAST HE DENIED THAT HE'S ALWAYS HAD AN INTER COMMUNAL VERY INCLUSIVE APPROACH NOT JUST OF THIS CAMPAIGN BUT HE'S A CAREER IN FACT SOME CONSERVATIVES LIKE BARONESS SADR VASILY HAVE PULLED BORIS JOHNSON UP ON THAT AND WHAT ABOUT ANGLE SMITH AS HE AGREED WITH JOHNSON
HE HASN'T NO HE'S BEEN VERY CAREFUL NOT TO ALTHOUGH HE POINTS OUT ALL SUGGESTS THAT HE CAN'T MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A ROBUST ENOUGH ABOUT KEN LIVINGSTONE'S OTHER COMMENT INTERVENTIONS IN THIS CAMPAIGN YOU'LL REMEMBER THERE WAS A ROW NOT LONG AGO AND HE WAS MAKING COMMENTS WHICH SOME DIDN'T LIKE MAKING CASTING ASPERSIONS ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF SOME OTHER AND PEAS SO HE HAD HE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO TO DISTANCE HIMSELF WHERE WHERE NECESSARY BUT IT COMES OFF THERE
YOU KNOW THAT A PREDOMINANT ISSUE OF IDENTITY POLITICS HAS OVERSHADOWED IT CAMPAIGN IF YOU LIKE WHICH HAS BEEN GOLDSMITH CAMPAIGN OR CLAIMS THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING UP A NEGATIVE OR TANK STRATEGY BASED ON SETTEE CAN'T BEING A MUSLIM SO TRAWLING OVER HIS PAST CONTACTS AS A CITY LAWYER AND SO ON AND IN A RECENT TIMES OBVIOUSLY HIS CONTACT WITH HER WITH THAT WITH A LOCAL IMAM SO THIS KIND OF IDENTITY
POLITICS FAIRLY NEGATIVE A POLITICAL A AND POLITICS HAS HOW HAS CERTAINLY OVERSHADOWED THE LAST WEEKS OF THIS CAMPAIGN INDEED WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT TIM WILL BE TALKING TO THAT GOLDSMITH A TEMPLE STREET
TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE HEADLINES CONTINUED TO MAKE GLOOMY READING IT'S FAIR TO SAY FOR THE LABOUR LEADER COOGAN'S NIGHTMARE BEFORE POLLING DAY IS HOW THE SUMS UP THE PARTY'S PREDICAMENT ON ITS FRONT PAGE THE TELEGRAPH BELIEVES THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET ARE PLOTTING TO TOPPLE JEREMY CALLED IN AFTER THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE OF HIS HANDLING OF THE ANTI CEMETERIES AND MISTER CORBIN IS INCOMPETENT MOOD IN A GUARDIAN INTERVIEW INSISTING YOU WON'T BE HELD ARBITRARY MEASURES OF SUCCESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLE
THE GUARDIAN ALSO PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM A GROUP DESCRIBING THEMSELVES AS JEWISH MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE LABOUR PARTY THEY REJECT THE IDEA THAT ANTI SENATORS ISM IS RIFE IN LABOUR THEY ARGUED THAT THE ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN TIME TO DAMAGE THEIR PROSPECTS NEXT WEEK AS DUNES THEY'RE RIGHT WE ARE APPALLED
BUT A SERIOUS ISSUE IS BEING USED IN THIS CYNICAL AND MANIPULATIVE WAY THOUSANDS OF PARENTS IN ENGLAND ARE PLANNING TO REMOVE THEIR CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL FOR ONE DAY NEXT WEEK IN A PROTEST AGAINST TESTS ACCORDING TO THE LEAD IN THE TIMES A CAMPAIGN GROUP LET OUR KIDS BIG KIDS CLAIMS AT THE TOUGHER ASSESSMENTS ARE MAKING SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS ANXIOUS THEIR LABELLING THEMSELVES AS FAILURES
THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THE TESTS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE IT WANTS BRITISH PEOPLES TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONAL AID INSIST THE ASSESSMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO JUDGE THE PERFORMANCE OF SCHOOLS AND SHOULDN'T BE A CAUSE OF STRESS FOR PUPILS IN ITALY THE MIRROR REVEALS THAT THE TELEVISION PRESENTER CHRIS PACKHAM CONSIDERED KILLING HIMSELF AS HE STRUGGLED WITH ASPERGER'S SYNDROME PAPER SAYS THE CONDITION LEFT HIM ISOLATED DURING HIS SCHOOL YEARS BUT ALSO FUELLED HIS ALL CONSUMING INTEREST IN WILDLIFE
HE DESCRIBES HOW HE FOUND THAT HE COULDN'T COPE WITH THE DEATH OF HIS PETS WHICH LEFT HIM FEELING SUICIDAL THE MIRROR PRAISES HIS HONESTY SO HE'S FRANK ADMISSION WILL HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS WITH ASPERGER'S SYNDROME AND CHALLENGE PREJUDICE TO WARRANT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE AS PLEDGED
BUSINESS RATES TO HELP PROTECT STRUGGLING LOCAL NEWSPAPERS DURING DINNER WESTMINSTER CORRESPONDENT MISTER OSMAN ALSO HINTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD FUND A REVENUE FROM THE B.B.C. LICENCE FEE TO HELP SUPPORT THE LOCAL PRESS HE ARGUES THE INTRODUCTION OF POWERFUL ELECTED MAYORS MEANS THERE NEEDS TO BE STRONG LOCAL MEDIA TO HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT AND NOTES THAT IN PREVIOUSLY SUCCESSFUL LOCAL
TITLES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE CLOSED THE MALE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WELCOMES MISTER OSBORNE'S PROMISE ON BUSINESS RATES SAYING THE REGIONAL PRESS HAS SUFFERED WITH ADVERTISING REVENUE MIGRATING TO THE END
LEICESTER CITY AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ON THE VERGE OF WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND STAGING ONE OF THE GREATEST SOME SAY THE GREATEST UPSETS SINCE BRITISH SPORTING HISTORY THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IT'S THE PLIGHT OF THE BOOKIES THE ODDS ON LESTER FINISHING TOP AT THE START OF THE SEASON WERE FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE AND ACCORDING TO THE F.T. TOTAL PAYOUTS COULD REACH FIFTY MILLION POUNDS THE TIME SAYS ONE MAN WHO HAD A FIVE POUND WAGER
STANDS TO WIN MORE THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND IN BETTY INTO THEM OF THE F.T. NOTES IT WAS CONSIDERED FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY I THOUGHT THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT CAN IT I THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT ELVIS WOULD BE FOUND ALIVE LOOK AT THE STILL WOULD TRY AND THAT DOES PUT IT INTO THIS THEY'VE GOT BOTH OF THEM ARE SENT SOME ISN'T IT IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO MAKE TIME NOW FOR MEET THE AUTHOR AND HERE IS JIM
PAT BARKER'S SECOND WAR TRILOGY TAKING US THROUGH TO THE BLITZ ON LONDON IN NINETEEN FORTY REVOLVES AROUND CHARACTERS WHO CARRY MEMORIES AND SCARS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR INTO THE SECOND MOON DAY IS THE BOOK THAT COMPLETES THE TRILOGY A STORY OF LOSS AND RELATIONSHIPS CHANGED UTTERLY OR BY A WORLD THAT SEEMS TO BE COLLAPSING IN THE RUBBLE THAT'S PILING UP ALL AROUND
IN A WAY IT'S THE END OF A STORY THAT BEGAN WITH REGENERATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT IN THAT FIRST PRIZE WINNING TRILOGY
WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH PAT BARKER ASKED HER FIRST OF ALL IF SHE FELT LOOKING BACK THAT WE WERE STILL PRONE TO MYTHOLOGISING LIFE
I THINK AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT AND EVEN IN THE UNDER THOUGH I TRIED TO TELL THE TRUTH I'M VERY MUCH AWARE OF HAVING LEFT CRUCIAL THINGS OUT LIKE THE CRIME WAVE THAT HIT LONDON DURING THE BLITZ YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WAS PULLING TOGETHER AND THEY WERE ALSO STICKY THING FROM LOOT FROM BODIES SOMETIMES
I HAVE I TEND TO LEAVE THE HOUSE I JUST COULDN'T FIND A WAY OF BRINGING IT IN BUT THE FIRE SERVICE IN PARTICULAR HAD A LOT OF EXPERIMENTAL NOVELISTS AND ED BUT IT ALSO HAD AN AWFUL LOT OF BURGLARS SO YOU'RE NOT ROMANTICISING THE LONDON OF THE BLITZ AND INDEED ANYBODY COMING TO THE BOOK
PUBLISHED IN HARDBACK LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME WILL REALISE THAT IT IS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS OF PEOPLE SOME OF WHOM WE KNOW FROM THE EARLIER TWO BOOKS IN THE TRILOGY
I'M NOT REALLY ABOUT THE BLITZ ITSELF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WITH ENORMOUS FORCE DISRUPTIVE FORCE IN THEIR LIVES BUT IT'S ABOUT THE WAY THEY WORK OUT THE RELATIONSHIPS IN WAR WHICH THEY REALISE IT'S GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'M ASKING IS IF YOU IF YOU'VE GOT A MARRIAGE LIKE ELLEN ELLEN PAUL HAVE WHICH IS A RATHER TIRED MARRIAGE WITH THE USUAL MIDDLE AGE TEMPTATIONS WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THIS NIGHT
AND THIS TEMPTATION MIGHT BE THE LAST ELEANOR IS IN THE AMBULANCE SERVICE PAUL IS AN EVERY WHARTON AND THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS LOT NIGHT MAY BE THEIR LAST AND THEY GRAB AT COMFORT FROM STRANGERS OR COMFORT FROM OLD FRIENDS AND GENERALLY BEHAVING IN A RATHER AMORAL WAY THE IDEA THAT THIS NIGHT MIGHT BE THE LAST IS A VERY POWERFUL ONE AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF POINTS IN THE BOOK AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ONE OF THE MAIN
PLOT LINES WHICH IS A RATHER A THRILLING AND TOUCHING ONE BUT THERE IS A FEELING ALWAYS THAT SOMEBODY MAY TURN A CORNER AND NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN OR
THE SUN MAY COME UP IN THE MORNING AND THERE'S A SCHOOL OR A PUB THAT WAS THERE LAST NIGHT THAT IS NO LONGER THERE SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW OF US CONFRONT ON A DAILY BASIS
I THINK IT'S I THINK LONDON AT THE TIME WAS HAUNTED I THINK IT WAS HAUNTED STILL BY MEMORIES OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST AND IT WAS ALSO HAUNTED AND IN OR NUMBER AND MORE VIVID BASIS BY PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THERE IT LITERALLY A VENUE SELLER WHO WON IF HIS REGULARS HASN'T TURNED UP TO BUY THE PAPER AND HE MAY BE DEAD IT'S INESCAPABLE THAT NOON DAY IS THE THIRD
BOOKING YOUR SECOND TO TRILOGY THE MATHS A FAIRLY OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE I HOPE WHICH BEGAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SIR SOON AND WILFRED OWEN AND THEN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR
YOU SEE AS OBVIOUSLY STORY THE TO CATACLYSMIC EVENTS AS BEING VERY CLOSELY CONNECTED DON'T YOU THE SECOND VERY MUCH PLAYED OUT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE FUR I THINK IF WE SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH I THINK FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TIME PEOPLE WILL SEE ONLY ONE WORLD WELL IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
YOU THINK THAT'S I THINK THEY'LL BE TRUTH IN THEIR METTLE AS THEY WERE IN THE THIRTY YEARS WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS IN A SENSE YES AND EVEN PEOPLE CHANGING SIDES BUT BASICALLY IT WILL BE SEEN AS A SINGLE WALL
YOUR ESCAPE A BHILIDH TIED UP WITH THE LITERATURE OF WAR WHICH HAS GOT A GREAT HISTORY AND A MUCH LOVED HISTORY FOR READERS DO YOU SOMETIMES FEEL
TRAPPED BY THESE TWO WARS ARE I FELT TRAPPED BY THE STEREOTYPING IN I STARTED OFF AS A WRITER AS A NORTHERN WORKING CLASS GOOD RETTY FEMINIST I KNOW IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO SORT OF MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AND THEN OF COURSE THE WAR NOVELIST I WAS ASKED WHY DO YOU NEVER WRITE ABOUT MEN NOW I'M ASKED WHY DO YOU ONLY WRITE ABOUT MEN YOU CAN'T WIN CAN YOU FIND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
GENERATIONS AND THERE'S A VERY TOUCHING SERIES OF PASSAGES ABOUT
ELEANOR'S MOTHER AND HER SISTER RACHEL AND THOUGH THESE HAUNTING LINES FROM BLAKE UM DAY THE CATERPILLAR ON THE LEAF REPEATS TO V. THY MOTHER'S GRIEF
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE ALLIANCE THE LODGES IN INDIAN I THINK REALLY GREAT RIGHT HANK THAT'S WILLIAM BLAKE OF COURSE CAN'T BE TRANSLATED INTO ANY TERMS OR OTHER THAN ITSELF THE CATERPILLAR ON THE LEAF REPEATS TO THE MOTHER'S GRIEF WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS AND WE KNOW IT'S TRUE
BARKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU JIM THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NO TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS THE WRITER MARTIN ROWE MORNING MARTIN GOOD MORNING THE FOOTBALL SEASON AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING IS REACHING ITS CLIMAX SHOULD MAN UNITED OR SPURS LOSE THIS WEEKEND THEN FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE OUTSIDERS LEICESTER CITY WILL BECOME PREMIERSHIP CHAMPIONS
CAN A TEAM BEREFT OF SUPERSTARS WHO NARROWLY AVOIDED RELEGATION A YEAR AGO REALLY DO IT ON THURSDAY MY OWN TEAM CONCEDED A LAST MINUTE EQUALISER AND WERE HELD TO A DRAW ELEVEN ALL WE'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR TWENTY YEARS FOURTEEN A SEVEN A SIDE
SOME PEOPLE HAVE MOVED AWAY SOME RETIRED HURT THESE ANKLES PRIDE IS ABOUT FITNESS FUN COMPETITION BUT MAINLY IT'S ABOUT COMMUNITY
MEN ARE DIFFERENT ON A FOOTBALL PITCH AND MILD MANNERED ACADEMIC IS THE MIDFIELD ENFORCER CHANNELLING HIS IN ROY KEANE THE GENTLE HOSPICE NURSE WIPING THE LIPS OF THE DYING BY DAY REVEALS A KILLER INSTINCT IN THE PENALTY BOX IN OUR HEADS WERE TWENTY ONE THOUGH SOME OF US CAN'T QUITE RECALL FIFTY ONE
UNDERNEATH IT ALL IS DYLAN THOMAS'S RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT WE KNOW HOW A PERFECTLY WEIGHTED PASS CAN POSTPONE THE FALLING DARK WE KNOW WHAT'S COMING HOW THE LIGHT FADES EVERY WEEK
RECENTLY WE WEPT THROUGH THE FUNERAL OF ONE OF OUR FINEST PLAYERS ANOTHER FRIEND AFTER A STROKE MUST NOW WATCHES FROM THE SIDELINES FOOTBALL MEASURES A DES IT'S THRILLING DRAMA CATCHES US AS PLAYERS OR FANS IT DES US TO BELIEVE AT THE IMPLAUSIBLE IS NOT ALWAYS THE IMPOSSIBLE
AT LEICESTER CITY MIGHT ACTUALLY DO IT LIKE GREAT LITERATURE OR ART TO MUSIC SOMETIMES SPORT SAYS THE UNSAYABLE THE THING NONE OF US DARE PUT INTO WORDS AND IT CAN BIND COMMUNITIES CLOSE IN THE DARKEST DAYS WITNESSED THE DIGNIFIED FORTITUDE AT THIS WEEK'S HILLSBOROUGH VERDICT OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO LOST THEIR LOVED ONES
A LITTLE COMPARED TO THE QUALITY OF DEEP SILENCE IN A PACKED STADIUM ON A MATCH DAY NEAR REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY FOR ALL OUR COMPETITION IN CONFLICT WE NOTICED THAT IN THE END IT'S ABOUT US NOT I ABOUT THE TEAM NOT THE PLAYER
CLAUDIO RANIERI IS LESTER DO PULL IT OFF GARY LINEKER THAT'S THREATENED WILL PRESENT MATCH OF THE DAY IN HIS BOXERS
BUT MORE SIGNIFICANT WILL BE THE WITNESS TO THE WORDS OF A RIVAL MANAGER ALISON VENGA THE ACT OF PLAYING FOR THE TEAM HE SAID MAKES EVERY INDIVIDUAL STRONGER
PAUL THE APOSTLE WOULD HAVE AGREED IN ONE OF HIS EARLY TEAM TALKS HE SAID IN HUMILITY COUNT OTHERS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN YOURSELVES AND IN ANOTHER THE BODY HAS MANY PARTS LIMBS ORGANS CELLS BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY YOU CAN NAME YOUR STILL ONE BODY
WHEN THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS WHEN IT'S ABOUT US NOT MY SPORT TRANSCENDS ITSELF ON SOME DAYS IT HAD A SACRED QUALITY
AT THE FIRST MATCH FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL OF A FRIEND RECENTLY WE ALL STOOD QUIETLY ON THE CENTRE CIRCLE HEADS BOWED REVERENT AND THEN WE KICKED OFF
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MARTIN ROWE THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT AND DOESN'T SEEM TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT THE N.H.S. IS CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FULLY ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES AT SOUTHERN HEALTH CARE TRUST WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND THAT ABILITY HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO QUESTION TO PUT IT MILDLY BY INSPECTORS AT THE CARE QUALITY COMMISSION A REPORT THIS WEEK SAID SENIOR MANAGEMENT AT THE TRUST WAS NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB
N.H.S. IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE HEALTH REGULATOR SAID THE FINDINGS WERE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING AND IT WAS CONSIDERING WHAT ACTION TO TAKE ONE OF THE GOVERNORS OF SOUTHERN HEALTH CARE TRUST MARK ASPEN OR HAS RESIGNED AFTER THAT REPORT HE TOLD THE WORLD TONIGHT LAST NIGHT WHY HE THOUGHT CHANGES HAVEN'T BEEN MADE QUICKLY ENOUGH
I THINK THE THE LEADERSHIP AT THE TRUST HAS SOME WEAKNESSES I THINK THAT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS I THINK FROM A MORE GENERAL POINT OF VIEW THERE'S A WAY OF DOING THINGS IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE WHICH MEANS THAT THINGS TAKE AN INCREDIBLY LONG TIME TO DO AND THERE'S ALMOST THESE OBSTACLES THAT THE HEALTH SERVICE ITSELF CREATES TO CHANGING QUICKLY
AND I THINK THAT ALL BUILDS TOGETHER TO MEAN THE CHANGES THAT WE NEEDED THAT SUDDEN JUST HAVEN'T HAPPENED AT THE RATE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT WHERE JOHN BY SO I'LL OFFEND FERNANDEZ WHO IS THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR FAREHAM ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THE TRUST OPERATES GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND WHAT A BUSINESS IT IS WHEN WE WERE HEARING FROM THE MOTHER OF A BOY WHO DIED IN THE BATH HAD AN EPILEPTIC FIT AND HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY
CARED FOR YESTERDAY AND WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IS WHILE SHE WAS CRYING OUT REALLY FOR US FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE SOME KIND OF ACTION AT THE TOP LEVEL ARE YOU CONFIDENT NOW THAT THINGS WILL CHANGE
YES AND I'VE MET MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN FAREHAM WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE WITH TRAGIC STORY SORT OF LOVED ONES OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WHILST UNDER THE CARE OF SOUTHERN HEALTH SADLY COMMITTED SUICIDE OR DIED AND IT SEEMS THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE THOSE DEATHS TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED OR ENGAGE WITH THEIR FAMILIES IN THE AFTERMATH WHICH CAUSED A LOT OF UNDERSTANDABLE PAIN AND DISTRESS
AND YES THERE'S A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR MANY YEARS NOW OF THE LEADERSHIP GOVERNANCE AND MANAGE BUT THAT'S THE THING FOR MANY YEARS NOW I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PARENTS AND THE OTHER
PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE SAYING IS THIS REALLY HAS IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SOMETHING JUST SUDDENLY BEING DISCOVERED TO BE WRONG WE'VE GOT TO WORK OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT WE HAVE ACTUALLY KNOWN PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT SOMETHING IS SEVERELY WRONG AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS WHAT WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING MORE QUICKLY
THERE HAS BEEN SOME ACTION WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE REGULATORS AND THE INDEPENDENT BODIES SO THAT'S ONE REALLY PLEASED THAT N.H.S. IMPROVEMENT HAS STEPPED IN AND APPOINTED A NEW CHAIRMAN JUST YESTERDAY WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND HE WILL BE CARRYING OUT A REVIEW INTO THE CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY OF THE TRUST TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES HE'LL BE WORKING WITH AN IMPROVEMENT DIRECTOR TO CARRY OUT
WHAT NEEDS TO BE URGENTLY DONE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S KEY IMPLEMENTING THE URGENT CHANGES TO REASSURE PATIENTS AND DEAL WITH THE FAILURES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED DO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE CORRIE CATRIONA PAT PERCY
BETWEEN A PERCY HAS COME TO PARLIAMENT TO MEET MANY OF MY HAMPSHIRE PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF TO TAKE QUESTIONS
ON DIET ON IN PARTICULAR CASES AND ON HER CAPACITY TO LEAD THIS ORGANISATION AND I THINK THAT
I DON'T THINK THIS IS ABOUT PERSONALITIES BUT CLEARLY A FRESH START IS NEEDED AND THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT WILL NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THEY CAN BEST HELP THAT PROCESS
SO YOU'RE SAYING SHE SHOULD RESIGN I'M SAYING THAT I'M FOR ASSISTED CALLING FOR RESIGNATIONS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET THE PROBLEM SORTED OUT TO ADDRESS THEIR FAILINGS IDENTIFY WHAT THEIR MOTHER WAS WAS TELLING US WHO WHO WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THESE THINGS AND I SUSPECT OTHERS AS WELL CERTAINLY OTHERS AS WELL IS IS THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN'T MOVE ON YOU CAN'T MAKE THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IF KATRINA PERCY STILL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SO IT'S RIGHT THAT SHE
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT YOU'D YOU WOULDN'T GO AS FAR AS TO AGREE WITH THEM I'M SAYING THAT THERE DOES COME A TIME WHEN IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO RE BUILD THAT CONFIDENCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULARLY AMONGST THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IN THE WIDER PUBLIC BUT AS THAT TIME COME
I THINK THAT THERE IS A CONCERN FOR MANY OF THE PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO THAT THEY WILL THAT THAT IT IS RIGHT FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE TO CONSIDER HER POSITION AND YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND SHE SHOULD I THINK THAT IT'S
A JUDGEMENT FOR HER TO TAKE HERSELF THERE'S N.H.S. IMPROVEMENT YOU HAS A LEGAL POWER TO CHANGE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IF THEY CONSIDER THAT THE PERSON THAT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES BUT I AGREE IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE IN POST AND THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN IN POST SO THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE PROBLEM
WELL THE FINANCE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR FAREHAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST JOHN HAMMOND GOOD MORNING JOHN AND WE ARE SLOWLY EMERGING FROM THAT VERY CHILLY SPELL WE HAD OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE IT AS WE HEAD TOWARDS MADE MY JUTES CONSULTS WITH A TOUCH OF FROST AROUND BUT THAT'S ALREADY VANISHING

A SIGNIFICANT CLUE HAS EMERGED AS SOME WHY THIS HELICOPTER CRASHED IT'S AN AMATEUR VIDEOS SHOWING THE ROTOR BLADES CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BODY OF THE HELICOPTER GENTLY CIRCLING THEIR WAY TO EARTH AS THE CAMERA PANS AROUND YOU SEE BLACK SMOKE THE AIRCRAFT HAS ALREADY HIT THE GROUND
DATA SHOWS IT FELL MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FEET IN JUST TEN SECONDS INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOW FOUND THE BLACK BOX WHICH RECORDS WHAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS DOING AND WHAT THE PILOTS WERE SAYING THEY ARE BUILT TO WITHSTAND CRASHES BUT THIS WAS A VERY HEAVY IMPACT SO IT MAY BE BADLY DAMAGED
THE SAME TYPE OF HELICOPTER AND E. C. TWO TO FIVE HAS HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE THE MODEL WAS IN EFFECT GROUNDED FOR A FEW MONTHS IN TWENTY TWELVE AFTER DITCHING TWICE IN THE NORTH SEA WITH GEARBOX PROBLEMS ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS KILLED
TOMMY CAMPBELL FROM THE UNITE UNION SAYS THE CRASH AS ONCE AGAIN RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ALRIC WORKERS WE NEED TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BRANCH UNCOVER BUT BY THESE EARLY REPORTS APPEAR SET OF THIS SOME SORT OF MECHANICAL FAULT AND FLAT ONES I TO BE THE CASE SO I THINK THE WORKFORCE IS CONFIDENCE AND HELICOPTER TRAVEL LIKE IAN HAD AN ALL TIME LOW
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES HAVE ANNOUNCED A TRUCE IN TWO AREAS OF THE COUNTRY AT SAYS IS AIMED AT SALVAGING THE U.N. BACKED CEASEFIRE THAT'S BEEN ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE IN RECENT DAYS THE TRUCE EXCLUDES THE CITY OF ALEPPO WHERE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS WEEK OUR CORRESPONDENT JIM MUIR REPORTS FROM BEIRUT
UNDER THE NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE SYRIAN ARMY SAYS IT WILL OBSERVE WHAT IT CALLED A REGIME OF CALM FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THE DAMASCUS AREA AND FOR THREE DAYS IN THE COASTAL LATTER AKIO PROVINCE IT'S AT THE GOAL WAS TO DEPRIVE THE REBELS OR TERRORISTS AS HE CALLED THEM OF A PRETEXT FOR HITTING CIVILIAN TARGETS AND TO BOLSTER THE EXISTING CEASEFIRE WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT TWO MONTHS AGO
THE AMERICANS ARE HOPING THAT IT WILL CALM HOSTILITIES IN THOSE AREAS THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE BIGGEST CURRENT TROUBLE SPOT ALEPPO WHICH THE RUSSIANS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE REFUSED TO INCLUDE IN THEIR LATEST TRUCE
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE PAST EIGHT DAYS OF DEEPENING VIOLENCE THERE THAT'S RAISED FEARS OF A LONG AND BITTER NEW BOUT OF HOSTILITIES WHICH WOULD DESTROY ANY HOPE OF A RETURN TO PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND GENEVA

BUT CONSERVATIONISTS DISAGREE OVER THE APPROACH CRITICS SAY DESTROYING SO MUCH ARE A RARE COMMODITY COULD INCREASE ITS VALUE AND ENCOURAGE MORE POACHING RATHER THAN LESS BOTSWANA WHICH IS HOME TO AROUND HALF OF AFRICA'S LAST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEPHANTS IS OPPOSED TO THE BURN AND ITS PRESIDENT WILL NOT ATTEND THE EVENT THE NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK

JAMES REID REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT LONDON WILL HAVE A NEW MAYOR ON FRIDAY AND IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE WILL GET TO KNOW HIM OR HER VERY WELL OVER THE COMING YEARS WHETHER WE LIVE IN LONDON OR NOT THINK BORIS JOHNSON OR KEN LIVINGSTONE THE RACE THIS TIME BETWEEN THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS SIDDIQUE KHAN FOR LABOUR AND ZAC GOLDSMITH OF THE CONSERVATIVES HAS BECOME PRETTY RANCOROUS LARGELY BECAUSE OF RACIAL ALLEGATIONS BEING FLUNG AROUND THE GOLDSMITH HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SO CALLED DOG WHISTLE POLITICS USING SPECIFIC WORDS OR PHRASES TO INFLAME EMOTIONS WITHOUT QUITE SPELLING IT OUT
I'M JOINED BY MISTER GOLDSMITH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND LET'S KICK OFF WITH THAT THOUGHT BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE IS AN IDEOLOGICAL CONTINUUM BETWEEN THE VIEWS OF KEN LIVINGSTONE ABOUT ISRAEL AND THEIR CANDIDATE FOR LONDON MAYOR SADIQ KHAN DO YOU AGREE
THEY'RE CERTAINLY PART OF THE SAME MOVEMENT WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY KEN LIVINGSTONE HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF STUDY CAN'T AND VICE VERSA SO IT'S A KEN LIVINGSTONE HASN'T SUDDENLY DECIDED TO MAKE OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS HE'S BEEN MAKING THEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND PREVIOUS OCCASIONS WAYS DOWN SO HE CAN'T HAVE
BRUSHED PUBLICLY TO HIS DEFENCE SO THAT IS AN IDEAL ISN'T IT THIS IS RATHER GOOD THIS IS NOT A KID THIS IS NOT A KEN LIVINGSTONE PROBLEM THIS IS A LABOUR PARTY PROBLEM THERE IS A A STREAK RUNNING THROUGH THE LABOUR PARTY I DON'T THINK ANYONE ROUND AND I DON'T THINK THE LABOUR PARTY NOW DENIES A STREAK RUNNING THROUGH THE PARTY WHERE ANTI SEMITE ISM OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FORM HAS
BECOME NORMALISED SAYS HE CAN'T PRESSED HORROR AS ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED LIVINGSTONE'S MISTER LIVINGSTON'S APPALLING HANG ON APPALLING AND INEXCUSABLE REMARKS AND CALLED FOR THE PARTY TO SUSPEND HIM
I DON'T HAVE THIS SINCERITY AND HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO HAVE SAID WHAT HE SAID HE SAID IT NEXT TO ME AND ONE OF OUR HUSTINGS WELCOME WHAT HE SAID AND WHAT HE SAID IN PREVIOUS IN RECENT WEEKS TO ON THIS ISSUE AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THAT STUDY IS ANTI SEMITIC I'VE NOT MADE THAT CLAIM AND I I HAVEN'T EVEN HINTED THAT HE'S AN IDEOLOGICAL CONTINUE AND BE DREAMS HE WAS HE WAS LIVINGSTONE'S YOU NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ON THESE KINDS OF ISSUES NOT TO RIDE TWO HORSES AND THE REALITY IS
THAT UNTIL THIS MERRILL CAME MAYORAL CAMPAIGN BEGAN AND SAID IT CAN'T HAS NOT BEEN AS ANYTHING LIKE AS CLEAR ON THIS ISSUE AS HE HAS BEEN IN RECENT WEEKS AND THAT AND SO ON THAT BASIS I THINK BORIS JOHNSON IS RIGHT BUT YOU'RE QUITE CLEAR THAT MY CAR IS NOT IN ANY WAY NOR EVER HAS BEEN ANTI SEMITIC
I'M QUITE CLEAR THAT HE ISN'T IN MAKING THE RIGHT COMMENTS IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMEL THAT'S A YES OR NO REALLY I GOT THAT QUESTION NOT YET SOUGHT I CUP HAD THERE JOHN I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID IT CAN'T IT'S ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES HE HAS HE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON IN THIS CAMPAIGN TO THE PERSON HE HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS CAMPAIGN BEGAN THERE HAD BEEN AN ENDLESS OCCASIONS DURING HIS LIFE INCLUDING RECENTLY
WHERE HE HAS GIVEN PLATFORMS AND OXYGEN AND EVEN MADE EXCUSES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE VIEWS WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING THAT THE CITY STANDS FOR I DON'T SUGGEST I'VE NEVER SUGGESTED THAT HE SHARES THOSE VIEWS BUT I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN PEOPLE ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THESE ARGUMENTS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
CONFIRM THEIR SUSPICIONS OF MANY PEOPLE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A SORT OF NUDGE NUDGE WINK WINK DON'T THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FAITH IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH ETHNICITY OR RELIGION OR BACKGROUND OR ANY OF THESE ISSUES YVETTE COOPER DURING THE LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN HEAVILY ATTACKED JEREMY CORBIN FOR SHOWING PLATFORMS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS EXTREME
PEOPLE WITH WHOM A SAID IT CONNOR SHOW APART FROM SHE SAID WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO GIVE THEM LEGITIMACY THE LABOUR PARTY SHOULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM IN ANY WAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT A SUD IT KHAN ON THE BASIS OF WHERE HE COMES FROM ANY MORE THAN IT'S RELEVANT TO ANY MORE THAN JEREMY CORBIN'S BACKGROUND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT GIVING PLATFORMS TO PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT WHAT YOU CAN'T
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS I THINK IS THAT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE DOWN WHAT ARE CLEARLY LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS BY BEING CASUAL IN THERE ACCUSATION OF RACISM YOU CAN'T WANT TO BE MAYOR OF THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD WITH A BIG SECURITY REMIT AND EXPECT PEOPLE NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR HAVING SHARED PLATFORMS GIVEN OXYGEN PROVIDED COVER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE CITY'S BEST IN SHOW ALL RIGHT
LET'S PICK UP BITS OF INFAMY THAT THAT SHARED PLATFORM IDEA YOU'VE ACCUSED HIM AMONGST OTHER THINGS OF SHARING A PLATFORM WITH SULIMAN GALI IMAM FROM MISTER KHAN'S CONSTITUENCY WHOM HE'S LABELLED AS ONE OF THE MOST REPELLENT FIGURES IN THIS COUNTRY YOU YOURSELF SHARED A PLATFORM OR RATHER WERE AT A MEETING WITH THAT VERY SAME MAN IT'S HAPPENS IN POLITICS AND YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS EVERYBODY ELSE
JOHN JOHN HE SHARED A PLATFORM NINE TIMES WITH A MAN WITH HIM BY THE WAY HAVE NEVER SHARED A PLATFORM BUT IT'S JUST ONE ILLUSTRATION OF A VERY LONG LIST OF ASSOCIATIONS WHO SHARED A PLATFORM WITH SOMEBODY CALLED FOR JEWS TO BE DROWNED IN THE OCEAN WHO THREATEN FIRE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD YOU WERE WITH MISS WAS OURS IT WAS IT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE ZEBRAS ARE EVENT WAS ASKED WAS ASKED ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT THE JEWS BEING DROWNED AFTER WHEN IT'S JUST FLOWERY LANGUAGE WILL IT'S NOT FLOWERY LANGUAGE IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A JEW LIVING IN ISRAEL
HE CHOSE TO DEFEND ONE OF THE SELF CONFESSED NINE ELEVEN TERRORIST HE PUBLISHED A LETTER AFTER SEVEN SEVEN BLAMING TERRORISM IN THIS COUNTRY ON BRITISH GOVERNMENT POLICY HE CHOSE TO TAKE THE GOVERNMENT ON TO TRY AND OVERTURN THE BAN ON THE HATE PREACHER LOUIS FARRAKHAN I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON HE PRODUCED A STEP BY SO ONE ALL RIGHT LOOK I WANT TO SEE THE MATCH SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT SOLOMON GYNAE THIS IS ABOUT JUDGEMENT I HAVE NEVER SAID AND NOR HAS ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH MY CAMPAIGN OR MY PARTY THAT
SUD IT CAN'T SHOW US THEIR VIEWS OF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE BUT THERE'S A BIG QUESTION OF JUDGEMENT AND I THINK HE'S SHOWN THE WRONG JUDGEMENT AND RATHER THAN TRY AND CLOSE DOWN THOSE QUESTIONS BY ACCUSING PEOPLE WHO ASKED THEM ME EVEN PEOPLE NOT CONNECTED WITH MY POLITICAL PARTY OF BEING RACIST THAT WHICH I THINK IS TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE I THINK YOU SHOULD ANSWER THIS RIGHT SO YOU SAY I THINK AS A LEGITIMATE DECISION TODAY ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SAYING IS THAT MY CAR ABSOLUTELY NOT
ANYTHING WHAT GIVE ME YOUR DESCRIPTION OF HIM THERE JUST GIVE ME YOUR DEFINITION OF A IT'S IN THERE I FIND THAT VERY DIFFICULT WHILE THE INFINITE PERHAPS THEY WERE ATTACK HIM PRETTY VIRULENTLY YOU'VE GOT A MINUTE I'M I MAINTAIN THAT I THAT I HAVE I THINK THERE ARE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT
HIS JUDGEMENT RIGHT AND I THINK IT IS ABSURD AND WHAT IS INFURIATING AND WRONG IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS TO BE LABELLED RACIST IT'S AN ABSURD THING TO SAY YVETTE COOPER ASKED EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTIONS OF JEREMY CORBIN ARE CLEARLY WAS NOT ACCUSED A BIT OF STOKING RACISM BUT IT'S PRETTY SHE WAS ASKING THE RIGHT SUCH AS YOU TELL ME THIS WHAT THE RESPONSIBLE WHEN SOMEBODY LIKE BORIS JOHNSON FOR INSTANCE USES AN EXPRESSION AS HE DID ADMITTEDLY QUITE A LONG TIME AGO ABOUT PICCANINNIES WITH WATERMELON
SMILES HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT YOU REGARD HIM AS A BIT OF A MATE DON'T IT I MEAN HE'S A FRIEND WORK BORIS BORIS BORIS IS A FRIEND HE'S AN ALLY HE'S HELPING WITH MY CAMPAIGN BUT THIS THIS IS A RED HERRING JOHN ARE YOURS WE WERE SEMI JUDGE YOU ARE ON YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE MY MATE HE'S HIS ANYWAY AS ANYONE IS ANYONE PRETENDING THAT BORIS JOHNSON IS AN EXTREMIST I DON'T THINK SO EVEN ARE YOU PRETEND HE'S SAID HE CAN'T PROMISE ENDING IS ANYONE PRETEND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MY ASSOCIATION WITH INDEED I'M TRYING TO NAIL DOWN WHAT IT IS YOU'RE ACCUSING SADLY KHAN OF ISSY ANNEXE
NO HE'S NOT I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT I'VE SAID AS THREE TIMES TO YOU NOW THAT I QUESTION HIS JUDGEMENT IN GIVING PLATFORMS OR UNCOVER MAKING EXCUSES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT
ON MANY MANY MANY OCCASIONS AND I QUESTION HIS JUDGEMENT AND HIS PARTY'S JUDGEMENT IN TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN THOSE QUESTIONS BY CALLING PEOPLE RACIST HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM A GROWING PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK IT DEMEANS THE DEBATE EURGH EURGH GREEN CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGNER HAVE BEEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE TERRIBLY GREEN ABOUT LONDON IF YOU WANT FOR INSTANCE AN ULTRA LOW EMISSIONS AND WHY DID YOU MAKE THE WHOLE CITY AN ULTRA LOW EMISSION CITY
I SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT I WANT THE WHOLE OF GREATER LONDON NOT JUST CENTRAL LONDON TO BECOME A POLLUTION FREE ZONE AND I'VE EXPLAINED IN MY MANIFESTO HOW HE WILL DO THAT WITH A DIRTY OR LORRIES BUT ONLY ON WHAT NO NO MUCH MORE THAN THAT MUCH MORE THAN THAT I'VE COMMITTED THAT EVERY BUS IN LONDON EVERY SINGLE BUS NOT JUST IN CENTRAL LONDON WILL EITHER BE ELECTRICAL
ULTRA LOW EMISSIONS AND COMPLIANT OH THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY ALREADY WHAT ABOUT CARS BUT WILL THEM TO SOME OF THEM ARE CUT I WANT TO CREATE A A LONDON WIDE A GREATER LONDON WIDE GREEN CAR CLUB LIKE PARIS IS BEGINNING TO DO AND IT WORKS OR HOW ABOUT MANNING DIESEL CARS ARE CHUCK A CHARGING INTEREST IF PEOPLE HAVE JUST BOUGHT A DIESEL CAR AND THEY USE IT FOR THEIR BUSINESS IT'S NOT FAIR TO COME ALONG AND BAN IT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T USE IT AS A BUSINESS SINCE YOU'VE GOT WOOD IT'S VERY HARD TO DISTINGUISH BUT YOU'VE GOT TO I DON'T
I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR DECISIONS THEY'VE ONLY TAKEN I WANT TO CREATE A SITUATION WHERE LONDON AS A WHOLE BECOMES A POLLUTION FREE ZONE AN AWFUL LOT I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT AS LONG AS WE PROTECT INVESTMENT IN IT WHICH I'M PLEDGED TO DO OUR BUSES ARE TAXIS WILL BE AT THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD WE CAN GET TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST HAULAGE FIRMS IN LONDON
OR REMOVING TRUCKS AT A RATE OF KNOTS OFF THE ROADS BY USING RAIL RISING RIVER AND AND CONSOLIDATION SOUNDS LIKE A MANDATE FROM THE CENTRE IN THE LONDON PLAN AND THAT'S WHAT I DO MY RECORD YOU CEMENT THIS SHOWS WELL THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I DID BUT I'D RATHER YOU DEAL IN SPECIFICS AND GENERALITIES AND YOU SAY YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN PUNISHING PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT NEW DIESEL CARS
WHAT ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING PUNISHED BY THE FILTH THAT COMES OUT OF THE BACK OF DIESEL CARS AND THEREFORE IT IS A SCANDAL AS YOU SAY IN IT NO NOBODY DENIES HE'S NO BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE MANUFACTURERS AND SO ON SO THERE IS SURELY AWAY TO FIND OF BANNING THOSE CARS IDENTIFYING WHO MUST ABSOLUTELY USE THEM FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND THOSE WHO DON'T BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD AT ALL WE HAVE WE HAVE A SCHEME IS ALREADY IN PLACE WHICH WILL KICK START IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR YEARS FROM NOW
WHICH IS AN ULTRA LOW EMISSION ZONE I'VE SAID THAT I'LL CONSULT ON STRENGTHENING THE STRENGTHENING AT AND RAMPING IT UP BUT IT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THE REASON IT STARTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AS BECAUSE THAT IS DEEMED TO BE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR DECISIONS TO MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS AND TO PREPARE
IF YOU BRING THAT FORWARD YOU ARE PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR FOR HAVING PREPARED FOR SOMETHING WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY AND I THINK THERE IS AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS THAT FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING EARLY BECAUSE OF YOUR IT'S TERMS IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SCANDAL IN LONDON TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR DIE EARLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF POLLUTION AND WE CAN DO WITH A FIFTEEN PER CENT OF ALL THE EMISSIONS COME FROM WORK'S VEHICLES ON DAY ONE I SO IF IN TAKE CRISIS
SO I'M EXPLAINING THE MEASURES JOINED YOU ON DAY ONE I CAN ENSURE THAT NO OR CONTRACTS ARE AWARDED TO COMPANIES THAT DON'T USE THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE WORKS BECAUSE THAT'S FIFTEEN PER CENT OF OMISSIONS AND THEN I'M ABSOLUTELY OPPOSING HEATHROW EXPANSION WHICH WOULD BE IRRECONCILABLE WITH ANY KIND OF HOPE OF MEETING AIR QUALITY TARGETS ARE CLEAN UP OUR BUSES ARE CAB'S ON MINI CABS AND I WILL CREATE AT THE FIRST THE CITYWIDE
A GREEN CAR CLUB AND I'LL PUSH THAT RELENTLESSLY ARE BACK THE CYCLING ALL RIGHT INVESTMENT WE SEEN UNDER BORIS JOHNSON WE HAVE ALL THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN WITHOUT BEING UNNECESSARILY PROVOCATIVE WITHOUT PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS GETTING NOSES OUT OF JOINT AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ZAC GOLDSMITH MANY BACKS
THE TIME TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT KENYA IS GOING TO SET FIRE TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE TONNES OF IVORY TODAY IT'S THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF TUSKS EVER PLANT IN ONE PLACE AND THE AIM IS TO SEND THE MESSAGE AROUND THE WORLD REALLY THAT THE APPETITE FOR IVORY IN ASIA AND THE POACHERS AND TRAFFICKERS HE'S SET IT IS CAUSING THE DEATHS OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ELEPHANTS EVERY YEAR BUT IS BURNING THE IVORY THE BEST THING TO DO AFRICA CORRESPONDENT ALISTAIR BE PEG REPORTS FROM MURRAY
WELL I'M OUT THE SITE OF THE IVORY BURN HERE IN NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK THERE ARE ELEVEN HUGE PYRES MADE UP OF THOUSANDS OF TASKS ALL OF THIS
PRESIDENT KENYATTA WILL LIKE THE FIRST OF THEM AND HIS GUESTS WILL LIKE THE OTHERS IT REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF ELEPHANTS THAT HAVE DIED IT'S WORTH A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS WAS TO RICHARD'S MARKET IN ASIA WE'RE TALKING WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION
BUT IT'S ALL GOING TO GO UP IN SMOKE BECAUSE KENYA BELIEVES IT'S WORTH NOTHING IT'S WORTH FAR MORE ON THE ELEPHANT BUT IT IS PILED UP LIKE THIS OR CARVED ON SOMEONE'S MANTELPIECE
BUT IVORY DOESN'T BURN THAT EASILY ROBIN HOLLISTER IS THE MAN WITH A CHALLENGE MAKING SURE ALL THE TASKS ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED
THE WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT BURNING IT IS THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY PUTTING YOUR BEYOND ECONOMIC VALUE WE COULD CRUSH IT IN A STONE THAT YOU KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY THE MOST SORT OF SPECTACULAR IS BURNING IT IT'LL DEFINITELY DESTROYED I MEAN IT'LL CHAR IT INITIALLY BUT THEN THE TEMPERATURES WERE AIMING AT BREAK IT DOWN COMPLETE
BUT WHY BURN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT'S TO BE GAINED IT COULD BE SOLD AND THE MONEY USED FOR CONSERVATION THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF KENYA WILDLIFE SERVICE IS COTILLION BATH IT THE REASON IS TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE WORLD THAT WE ARE NUMBER ONE COMMITTED TO CONSERVATION AND TO UNDERLINE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE ANY VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO IVORY AND RAIN OR AN EXCEPT ON ELEPHANTS AND RYAN
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY VIEW A DRAMATIC STATEMENT CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES BUT DESTROYING LARGE AMOUNTS OF A RARE COMMODITY CAN AFFECT ITS PRICE ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIST MIKE NORTON GRIFFITHS THINKS BURNING IVORY IS THE WRONG APPROACH
I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT IS I THINK IT'S ALMOST RECKLESS OF THE KENYANS THE PROBLEM IS IT'S A VERY LARGE BURNER BY PRE FIVE PER CENT OF THE GLOBAL STOCKS OF IVORY
WHEN YOU TAKE FIVE PER CENT OR STOCKS OUT OF A MARKET LIKE THIS HAVE A RESOURCE MARKET
SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT COULD THAT DO TO THE PRICE HAS BEEN THE ARGUMENT IS THAT BY TAKING IT OUT OF THE MARKET YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST I THINK IF YOU SEE ANYTHING YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR TRADERS WILL SEE FIVE PER CENT LESS IVORY AVAILABLE TO BE RELEASED TO THEM THEIR RESPONSE WILL BE THEY'RE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO RELEASE THIS HYBRID TO US WE MUST GO AND COLLECT MORE
THE HELICOPTER LANDS AND FOUR ARMED RANGERS IN THE TRACKING DOG RUSH OUT IT'S A DEMONSTRATION OF AN ANTI POACHING FAST RESPONSE TEAM WORKING ON THE PRIVATE GAME RESERVES WHERE MOST ANIMALS ARE POACHED AND TRAINED BY FORMER BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES
THE DEMO WAS PART OF THE GIANT'S CLUB SUMMIT MEETING WHICH HAS BROUGHT THREE AFRICAN HEADS OF STATE AND SENIOR CONSERVATIONISTS TOGETHER HERE IN KENYA SO THIS IS DONE AND THIS IS THE LAST
NO MORE THAN THE WHITE RHINO MALE
LEFT IN THE WORLD LIKES GRAHAM RUNS CAMPAIGN GROUP SPACE FOR GIANTS THAT HELPED ORGANISE THE SUMMIT MORE THAN A TON OF RHINO HORN IS ALSO BEING BURNT TODAY AND THE LONG TERM IT'S ALL ABOUT BEYOND POACHING HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT ANIMALS LIKE THIS LIKE ELEPHANTS
SIX TIME ANIMALS FOUGHT ON ANIMALS IS A BIG FEROCIOUS BEASTS CAN SURVIVE IN A HUMAN WORLD BECAUSE THAT'S THE BROTHER IN RIGHT NOW UNLESS PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING FROM
THESE ANIMALS UNLESS PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING THE COST OF LIVING IS ANIMALS THEY'VE GOT NO FUTURE SO THAT'S THE LONG TERM
ELEPHANT NUMBERS ARE DECLINING FAST IT'S HOPED KENYA'S IVORY BURN WILL SEND AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE BUT IT'S ABOUT LEADERSHIP IN AFRICA TO STOP THE CORRUPTION THAT ALLOWS TRAFFICKING AND POACHING TO THRIVE AND IN CHINA TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES TO IVORY TO DRY UP
THAT WAS ALISTAIR LEAVE REPORTING FROM NAIROBI TIME TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT GARY'S EVEN SPORT JUSTIN JOHN GOOD MORNING THIS TIME LAST YEAR LEICESTER CITY WERE FIGHTING TO AVOID RELEGATION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE THEY DID MANAGE TO ESCAPE AND AT THE START OF THE SEASON THEY WERE AMONG THE FAVOURITES TO BE RELEGATED AGAIN AND CONSIDER THIS THEY WERE FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE TO ACTUALLY WIN THE LEAGUE OF MORE THAN A FEW PEOPLE MIGHT BE CASHING IN BECAUSE OF LEICESTER CITY BEAT MANCHESTER UNITED TOMORROW THEY'LL BE CHAMPIONS AND WHAT WILL BE THE BIGGEST DOMESTIC FOOTBALL STORY EVER

THAT'S MY I'LL GET IT THERE WITH A SOUFFLE WITH FOOTBALL IN GENERAL BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD FACILITIES TO TWO GREW UP AS A CHEW
IT'S GOOD TO CREATE FOOTBALL PITCHES IS GOOD TO CREATE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE UNTIL FOOTBALL WE KIND OF
AND LASTLY YOU REALLY WANT TO OBVIOUSLY BEAT LEICESTER CITY BUT I'M SURE THAT IN A WAY IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR FOOTBALL WOULDN'T IT IF LESTER DID WIN THE LEAGUE DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT WELL I AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT I WANT TO BE IN THE SUN

WITH A SUMMER IN THE NEWS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HAS SET UP AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO ANTI SEPARATISM WITHIN THE PARTY FOLLOWING DAYS OF TURMOIL OVER THE ISSUE EARLIER THIS WEEK TWO PROMINENT PARTY MEMBERS KEN LIVINGSTON AND SUSPENDED AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF MAKING ANTI SEMITIC REMARKS

PEOPLE USING THEIR PHONES ARE BROUGHT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL SEE REDUCTIONS IN THEIR BILLS FROM TODAY FURTHER CAMPS ARE COMING INTO EFFECT FOR ROAMING CHARGES IN ALL TWENTY EIGHT E.U. COUNTRIES
THANK YOU HE'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE SIRIUS DIVIDED SECOND CITY ALEPPO SEEN YET MORE BLOODSHED OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS YESTERDAY REBEL FORCES SHELLED A MOSQUE IN A GOVERNMENT HEALTH DISTRICT KILLING FIFTEEN PEOPLE AIR STRIKES IN THE REBEL CONTROLLED EAST OF THE CITY LEFT ELEVEN DEAD THEY DESTROYED A MEDICAL FACILITY
AND THE CARNAGE FOLLOWED WELL A WEEK OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE THOMPSON HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO MOHAMMED WHO IS A RESIDENT OF ALEPPO JUST HOURS AFTER HE MANAGED TO REACH THE COMPARATIVE SAFETY OF THE CAPITAL DAMASCUS
ONE IT WHAT I FEEL ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ALEPPO NOW EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK OUR BUILDINGS ARE IN RUBBLE AND BLOOD AND BODIES ARE EVERYWHERE
I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN TO SEE THIS MANY PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE CITY THEY CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE
THIS IS SYRIA'S BIGGEST CITY AND NOW MUCH OF IT IS IN PIECES I BEG ANYONE AROUND THE WORLD WHO CARES ABOUT HUMANITY TO HELP STOP THIS
THE LATEST REPORTS WE HAVE SUGGESTS THAT AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE DIED OVER THE LAST SIX DAYS LARGELY BECAUSE OF SHELLING AND BOMBING AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ALEPPO OF REBEL AREAS OF ALEPPO HAVE BEEN WITHOUT WATER AND ELECTRICITY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW SO HOW ARE PEOPLE COPING WITH ALL THIS THERE
IT'S HARD TO PUT AN EXACT FIGURE ON THE CASUALTIES BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THINGS ARE TERRIBLE AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BOMBING THERE WAS HARDLY ANY FOOD AT ALL AND THE LITTLE THERE IS IS VERY EXPENSIVE
BOTH REBELS AND GOVERNMENT FORCES FIRE AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT CARING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO CIVILIANS MOST PEOPLE AND I'LL JUST RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES TRYING TO FIND SOME SORT OF SAFETY YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM ALEPPO JUST A FEW HOURS AGO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE BEFORE YOU GO BACK IF INDEED YOU GO BACK AT ALL
YES OF COURSE I'M GOING TO GO BACK ALEPPO IS MY CITY IT'S THE PLACE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE ALL MY MOST BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES ARE THERE IN FACT I'M GOING BACK TOMORROW
BUT ISN'T THAT VERY DANGEROUS I NEVER THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN DESTINY NOBODY KNOWS WHEN THEY WILL DIE SO WHEN IT HAPPENS TO ME I WANTED TO BE IN MY HOME CITY
IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT THE REBEL HELD AREAS OF ALEPPO COULD FALL TO GOVERNMENT FORCES DO YOU THINK THAT'S UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON
AFTER ALL THIS TERRIBLE CARNAGE I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT EITHER SIDE IS GOING TO GIVE UP AND ACCEPT DEFEAT IN ALEPPO
THEY'LL BOTH KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL THE END I JUST HOPE THAT SOMEHOW FROM SOMEWHERE A POLITICAL SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND THAT BOTH WILL ACCEPT AND ALL THIS KILLING WILL STOP
THERE WAS MIKE THOMPSON TALKING TO MOHAMMED LET US TALK NOW TO BUST MY CUNT MANI WHO IS ONE OF THE CHIEF NEGOTIATORS FOR THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION AT THE GENEVA PEACE TALKS JOINS US NOW FROM PARIS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR THE AGONY THAT ALEPPO ARE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS TO STOP
I SUPPOSE IT QUITE CHOIR IS A VERY SIMPLE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HIS BOMBINGS BY THE FORCE OF THE REGIME AS WELL AS FRESH OUT THE POPULATION ON THE GROUND HE'S USED TO IT TO THE AIR FORCE AND THE RECOGNISE US PLANES AND THEY DO SEE RUSSIAN PLANES OUT THERE SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A RETURN OF A COMMITMENT BY RUSSIA IN PARTICULAR
TO THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES WHICH WAS AGREED AT THE END OF FEBRUARY AND WAS IMPLEMENTED WHEN RUSSIA WAS WANTED IT TO BE IMPLEMENTED THAT IS IT IS ABLE TO PRESSURE THE REGIME TO DO SO THERE'S CLEARLY A DECISION HERE TO GO
FOR A FULL ATTACK ON AVON ALEPPO AND CHANGED THE BALANCE OF FORCES ON THE GROUND DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT RUSSIA HAS DECIDED NOW THAT THEY WANT A SAD TO REMAIN IN POWER AND OBVIOUSLY IF HE WERE TO SEIZE ALL OF ALEPPO THAT WOULD BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ACHIEVING
I DON'T THINK A LIBERAL IS EASY TO TAKE A BRUSH I HAVE AS CLEARLY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NEVER A HINT THAT IT WANTED TO PUT ASIDE BACK IN PLACE AND GET POLITICAL AGREEMENT ON ITS OWN TERMS AS I HAD BEEN A FEELING HADN'T THOUGH THAT PART OF THE REASON WHY RUSSIA PULLED OUT AND MADE SUCH A SONG AND DANCE OF PULLING OUT RECENTLY WAS THAT
IT WANTED TO SEND A SIGN TO A SAD THAT HE WASN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE STAYING LONG TERM WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RUSSIAN VIEW IS NOW OF WHAT SHOULD I HAVE
I THINK THE RUSSIANS ARE REUSING SYRIA AS A PLACE TO PROVE THAT THEY
SET THEIR OWN TERMS IN A COUNTRY THEY DO NOT WANT REGIME CHANGE BUT NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT REGIME CHANGE BY FORCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS WHAT WE DON'T SEE FROM RUSSIA WE ARE SEEING WHAT WE SAW IN UKRAINE WHICH IS SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER AND CLEARLY NOW THAT THE POSITION OF RUSSIA IS TO PUT THE REGIME BACK IN ITS PLACE
BOTH IN ALEPPO THERE IS MOBILISATION AND CONCENTRATION OF TROOPS OR MOVING ALONG AND TO THE NORTH EAST OF SEA THAT IS IN THE AREAS AGAINST THAT WE WISH THAT WAS THE CASE BUT IT IS CONCENTRATING ON AN APPLE AND I LOVE ALWAYS A CITY WHERE THE MODERATE FORCES A BEER INCLUDING CIVILIAN POPULATION SO RUSSIA IS BASICALLY KILLING THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO WORK WHO WERE WILLING TO COMMIT TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND WORK
PRESENT IN GENEVA SO WHAT IS EXACTLY THE OUTCOME OF A BATTLE IN ALEPPO IN TERMS OF POLITICS HOW DO WE GO BACK TO GENEVA WHO GOES BACK AND WHO AGREES ON A COMPROMISE SOLUTION
ALL THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS AREN'T THEY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE IF THE RUSSIANS HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA AND ARE DETERMINED TO SEE IT THROUGH
WHAT PRESSURE THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHETHER IT'S AMERICA WERE THE RATES OTHER ARAB NATIONS ARE INVOLVED WHETHER WELL WHO CAN PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO CHANGE
WELL WE CAN DEFINITELY SAY THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS LOST ITS AVERAGE
IN THE SYRIAN SITUATION MAYBE IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL BUT SYRIA DEFINITELY OR IS UNWILLING TO USE IT AND THAT MAY WELL BE THAT THE REALITY THE UNITED STATES LEAVING RUSSIA BOMB ALEPPO AND WE HAVE HEARD
VERY AMBIGUOUS STATEMENTS FROM THE U.S. SAYING LET TURKEY AND THE COUNTRYSIDE OF DAMASCUS BUT NOT A LEPER OR NO WE ARE AGREEING ON A NEW TRUCE IN THOSE AREAS BUT NOT IN THEM UP WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES THIS SAY TO US THAT THE UNITED STATES AS ALLOWING
THE UPPER ENCIRCLEMENT OF ALEPPO THESE ATTACKS ON ALEPPO AND LEAVING RUSSIA TO DO SO I MUST SAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO ON FOR A MONTH AND MONTH ALEPPO HAS A VERY BIG CITY AND WILL NOT BE ENCIRCLED AND BESIEGED EASILY SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE A VERY VERY DEADLY
SERIES OF BATTLES YOU SEE THERE IS A VIEW ISN'T THERE ABOUT SOME OF THE WEST WHICH CERTAINLY HEARD IT IN BRITAIN INCLUDING FRONT SOME MILITARY PEOPLE WHO SAY LOOK WE'VE WE'VE GOT SUCH A FIGHT AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
WE REALLY NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON THAT AND PART OF THE BUSINESS OF CONCENTRATING ON THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND NOT THAT WE LIKE PRESIDENT ASAD APPROVE OF WHAT HE'S DONE BUT THAT ACTUALLY HE HAS GOT TO BE TO SOME EXTENT AN ALLY IN THAT STRUGGLE
LET ME TELL YOU THE OPPOSITION FORCES ARE ALL READY AND ARE ACTUALLY FIGHTING ISIS AND IF ONLY THAT THAT THOSE BATTLES AGAINST THE FROM THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IF ONLY THE BATTLE IN A LEPER WOULD STOP ALL OF THESE FORCES WOULD MOBILISE AGAINST ISIS AND THEY ARE DOING SO IN THE SOUTH ALREADY SO WHAT WE ARE SPEAKING OF SOMETHING THAT IS A MYTH
A SAAB IS HANDS OVER TO ISIS AND THEN TAKES THEM BACK IN AGREEMENT WITH ICE AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN MANY MANY PLACES WHEREAS THE OPPOSITION FORCES ARE THE ONES WHO WERE SINCERELY FIGHTING ISIS IF WE COULD HAVE A CONCENTRATION OF FORCES AND WE CAN EVEN HAVE THE OPPOSITION FORCES FIGHT IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE SYRIAN ARMY OF OUR SIDE SO WHAT WE NEED IS AN AGREEMENT IN GENEVA THE TELLS US
ALL FORCES CAN MOBILISE AGAINST ISIS AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIGHT ICES HAS A SAD REDUCED ICE HAS HORSES ANYWHERE IN SYRIA THEY'VE ONLY EXPANDED UNDER A SUN SO ALL WHAT WE NEED NOW IS FOR THE FURIOUS FORCES AGAINST ISIS TO MOBILISE AND WORK NOW THAT'S MCCUDDEN MALE MEMBER OF ONE OF THE CHIEF NEGOTIATORS FOR THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION IN THE GENEVA PEACE TALKS THANKS VERY MUCH
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A LOOK THE PAPERS AND THE HAS SOME MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET BIGGER PLOTTING TO TOPPLE JEREMY CORBIN HE QUOTES A SAUCER IN THE CHALLENGE NOW LOOKS INEVITABLE DURING THE SUMMER IT'S A LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS ARE A DISASTER IT THINKS IS A GROWING SPLIT BETWEEN MISTER CORBIN AND JOHN MACDONALD THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR WHO IS APPARENTLY ALLEGEDLY AFTER HIS LEADER'S JOB THE EXPRESS ACCUSES JEREMY COMMON HAVE A LACKLUSTRE RESPONSE TO CLAIMS OF ANTI SEMITE ISM AND A GUARDIAN INTERVIEW HE STRESSES
PARTY'S RECORD STANDING AGAINST RACISM INSISTING HE WILL NOT ALLOW THE CURRENT ROAD TO BLOW HIS LEADERSHIP OF COURSE THE SUN SAYS LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF RUNNING SCARED FROM A TELEVISED E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER THE BRICKS AT CAMP BILLY'S MISTER CAMERON ONLY WANTS TO FACE UKIP'S NIGEL FARRAJ TO AVOID WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS BLUE ON BLUE DEBATE THE SUN SAYS NUMBER TEN SOURCES HAVE REJECTED THIS
THE TIMES COLUMNIST MATTHEW PARRIS HAS SOME ADVICE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD HE WIN THE REFERENDUM HE SAYS HE SHOULD FORGET ABOUT TRYING TO BRING THE CONSERVATIVES BACK TOGETHER AND INSTEAD BURN HIS BRIDGES WITH THE RIGHT OF THE PARTY HE URGES DAVID CAMERON TO CONSIDER HOW IT'LL PLAY WITH THOSE HE DESCRIBES AS MODERATES OF PRIME MINISTER REWARDS THE CREW WHO STABBED HIM IN THE BACK CALLED HIM A LIAR AND QUESTIONED HIS PATRIOTISM
QUEEN'S LATEST FORAY INTO SOCIAL MEDIA MAKES MANY OF THE PAPERS SHE FEATURES IN A VIDEO ALONGSIDE PRINCE HARRY PROMOTING THE INVICTUS GAME SET UP TO RAISE MONEY FOR WOUNDED SIR SERVICE PERSONNEL IN THE FILM BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA ALSO APPEAR THEY THROW DOWN A GAUNTLET FOR THE BRITISH TEAM WILL COMPETE IN FLORIDA AND MAY AND SPUN INTO THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT'S CHALLENGE THE QUEEN DELIVERS HER WEATHERING A REALLY PLEASE AND ROBERTS IN THE GUARDIAN SAYS EASY TO IMAGINE HER ADDING
IT'S FUN VIRAL YET WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE ROLLING IN THEM AND THE FASHION MAGAZINE WAS PLANNING TO CELEBRATE ITS CENTENARY GO FEATURING A MODEL WHO IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD BUT THE TELEGRAPH AND THE TIMES PRINTED PHOTOGRAPH OF A MARJORIE BOO GILBERT WEARING A FUCHSIA
PINK COAT A DARKER BLUE TOP BY VICTORIA BECKHAM AND WHITE TROUSERS SHE DESCRIBES A FIFTIES AS A FAVOURITE DECADE REMEMBERS FONDLY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TROUSER SUIT AND MOURNS THE DEATH OF HATS AS AN EVERYDAY FASHION ACCESSORY THE TIMES COURT TO DENY THE MOST EXPENSIVE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES
BY A TINY BEACH MARTIN A MEMBER OF THE WEASEL FAMILY WEASEL THE EXPERIMENT IS OF COURSE THE LARGE HAD WRONG COLLIDER AT CERN IN SWITZERLAND THE PROJECT THAT COST BILLIONS AND IS WELL ON ITS WAY TO UNRAVELLING SOME OF THE MOST PROFOUND MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE IT'S ALREADY DONE SOME REMARKABLE STUFF LIKE PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF THE HIGGS BOSON BUT THEY DIDN'T RECKON WITH THE WEASEL DOCTOR VICTORIA MARTIN IS A PARTICLE PHYSICIST AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY SHE'S PART OF THE TEAM WORKING ON THE ATLAS EXPERIMENT WITH THE L. Y. C. KNOWS IT WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU
IF THIS IS AN ENTIRELY WONDERFUL STORY BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT AT CERTAIN NO NO WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD THIS WEEK TO GO FIRST
COLLISION WHICH SEAWARD OFF LYING OVER THE WINTER TO BE LICKED
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FIRST DATA COMING THROUGH THIS WEEKEND AND THE WEASEL TUESDAY A LITTLE CABLE AND THE WHOLE THING'S DOWN FOREVER OH IS THAT ME IS THAT WHAT IT DID IT JUST TO THROW A LITTLE CABLE BUT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND YES IT'S ONE OF THEIR ELECTRICITY SUBSTATIONS THAT'S ON THE SURFACE OF THE L.H.C. ITSELF IS HIS UNDERGROUND BUT THE SUN'S UP ON THEM
AND IT ACHIEVED RICKY THERE IT HAPPENS A LOT WITH COLOURS YEAH I KNOW BUT WHY MISS WELL YEAH ABBA CARS AND THEY HAD A LARGE HAD ROG COULDN'T THEY JUST STICK IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN BECAME PUT A BIT OF TAPE ON THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT IT IS
JUSTICE LIKE STATIONS ON THE ELECTRICIANS HAVE TO GO IN AND CHECK IT AND CHECK THAT IT'S ALL SAFE AND TEST IT WILL RIGHT SWITCH THE ELEC SI BACK AND THERE'S THIS OF COURSE IS NOT THE FIRST TIME AN ANIMAL OR ONE IN THE OTHER CASE A BIRD OATH INTERFERED WITH CERTAIN YES SO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THEN WE WERE JUST SWITCHING THE ALEX YON ALMOST FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH ONE OF THE THE ELECTRICITY SUBSTATIONS ON THE SURFACE
THE RUMOUR IS IT WAS A SEAGULL APPARENTLY ALL THE FRIENDS' FEATHERS WHO HAD DROPPED THE GAY FOR BREAD I THINK IT WAS SIX ROUGHLY DID TO BE ABLE TO GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS
IT INTO WATER IT AGAIN TO ONE OF THE ELECTRICITY SUBSTATIONS I MEAN THIS IS ABOUT THE ONLY THING ON THE SURFACE THAT ONE COULD INTERFERE WITH THESE LOVELY PRETTY NORMAL MOST OF THE LISTENERS
A SUBSTATION ER IT'S SORT OF MILDLY BIZARRE ISN'T IT THAT THIS VASTLY HUGELY SOPHISTICATED SCIENTIFIC OPERATION RELIES ON THE SORT OF LITTLE SUBSTRATE AS WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR BACK GARDEN ALMOST LIKE A LITTLE BIT I THINK THEY'RE SLIGHTLY LARGER SUBSTATIONS THAT BUT YEAH I MEAN WE NEED ELECTRICITY WE NEED A LOT OF ELECTRICITY TO RUN THE LEGS LATER WE MANAGE OUR OWN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
TO SOME EXTENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S GONE WRONG RIGHT AND ALL I CAN SAY IS KEEP YOUR EYE OUT FOR WEASELS AND SEAGULLS AND MAYBE WE WILL DISCOVER THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE OF THE DATUM MARTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE CAN YOU BE ANTI ISRAELI WITHOUT BEING ANTI SEMITIC QUESTIONED SWIRLS AROUND THE DEBATE ABOUT LABOUR'S CURRENT DIFFICULTIES WHAT DOES THE DIVIDING LINE ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE WE HAD ON THIS PROGRAMME DURING THE WEEK AND OPEN DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO JEWISH COMMENTATORS ABOUT WHETHER DISPUTING ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST DID OR DIDN'T NOT ITSELF CONSTITUTE ANTI CEMETERIES
OTHER SUGGEST THE ILLEGAL SETTLEMENT BUILT PALESTINIAN LAND IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE MODERN PROBLEM SO HOW DOES IT ALL LOOK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BURN HIS INJURIES THEM I ASKED HIM FIRST WHAT THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED DIFFERENCE WAS BETWEEN ANTI SCIMITARS AND ANTI ZIONIST
ANTI ZIONISM IS OPPOSITION TO THE THE IDEA OF ZIONISM WHICH EMERGED AS AN IDEA IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THAT WAS A TIME WHEN NATIONALISM AND SELF DETERMINATION WERE VERY BIG IDEAS IN EUROPE WHERE LARGE EMPIRES RULED MANY DIFFERENT RACES
IF YOU LIKE ZIONISM OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS THE JEWISH EQUIVALENT OF THAT NATIONALISM WAS THE IDEA THAT JEWS COULD GO BACK TO WHAT THEY REGARDED AS THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND WHICH DEPENDING ON DEFINITIONS MEANS VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF THE LAND BETWEEN THE RIVER JORDAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA NOW ANTI SEMITE
IS THE HATRED OF JEWS BECAUSE THEY JEWS INCLUDES THE BLOOD LIBEL
THE JEWS MURDER KRISTIAN'S TO USE THEIR BLOOD IN JEWISH RITUALS AND IT ALSO CLASSICALLY INCLUDES THE PROMOTION OF STEREOTYPES THE EVIL GRASPING JEW LIKE SHYLOCK IN SHAKESPEARE'S MERCHANT OF VENICE
SO WHEN YOU COME TO MODERN TIMES AND TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND THE WAY THAT ISRAEL IS
SET UP DID IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT ISRAEL THAT FUEL WELL ALL OF ALL OF THESE THINGS BOTH ANTI ZIONISM AND ANTI CENTRES AS WELL
WELL YOU REALLY THE BIG ISSUE IS WHERE IS THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT REGARD AS LEGITIMATE CRITICISM OF THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AS A GOVERNMENT
AND ANTI SUMMIT ISM WHICH IS SIMPLY CRITICISING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE JEWS NOW HERE'S SOME EXAMPLES THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE P.D.S. CAMPAIGN WHICH IS ABOUT BOYCOTT DIVEST HIM AND SANCTIONS AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE OF ITS OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND ACTIONS IT'S TAKEN
THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN ANTI SEMITIC CAMPAIGN BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS IT DENIES THE RIGHT IT DUE TO SELF DETERMINATION THEY'D SAY USES CLASSIC ANTI SALMON SEMITIC SYMBOLS AND EVEN AT TIMES
ACCORDING TO N.G.O. MONITOR DOT ORG WHICH FULL LOOKS AT THESE THINGS WERE PRO ISRAEL POINT OF VIEW COMPARES CONTEMPORARY ISRAELI POLICY WITH THE NAZIS NOW SUPPORTERS OF THIS CAMPAIGN CALLED B. D. S. SAY IT'S A LEGITIMATE TACTIC OF NON VIOLENT RESISTANCE
AND THE ONLY AND THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ONLY COMPLAINS ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WORKS AS IT WORKS FOR THAT THROWS THEIR CONCERN AS A FORM OF PRESSURE SO I MEAN THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES ON THE DIVIDING LINE THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL YOU MAY REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS IN
IN A VOTE THAT WAS NON BINDING EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA OF RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF U.N. MEMBERS HAVE RECOGNISED A PALESTINIAN STATE BUT THE COMMUNITY SECURITY TRUST WHICH IS A BRITISH JEWISH ORGANISATION THAT MONITORS ANTI SENATORS
IT'S SAID THAT THAT VOTE STOKED ANTI SEMITE ISM IN BRITAIN SO WHERE YOU PUT THAT DIVIDING LINE IS HE'S QUITE A MATTER OF DEBATE ONCE YOU GET AWAY FROM THE DEEP THE CLEAR EXTREMES AND WERE ALL THESE ARGUMENTS LOOK LIKE TO PALESTINIANS
WELL YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF LOT OF PALESTINIANS YOUR PALESTINIANS OFTEN ROUTINELY REFER TO ISRAELIS WHEN THE SPEAKING ARABIC THEY DON'T CALL THEM THE ISRAELIS THEY CALL THEM THE JEWS
AND YOU DO HEAR QUITE ANTI SEMITIC REMARKS FROM
PALESTINIANS AND SOMETIMES IF YOU CHALLENGE THEM ON THEM THEY SAY THINGS LIKE YOU DON'T ALWAYS HIT WAS BY THE WAY I HAVE TO SAY THAT BUT SOME AS A CHALLENGE AND THEY SAY LOOK IT'S ABOUT THE OCCUPATION THEY'VE TAKEN OUR LAND THEY'VE TAKEN WHAT WE BELIEVE IS OURS SO WE DON'T LIKE THEM FOR THAT REASON AND THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY AND HE SAID
FOR CENTURIES JEWS LIVED NEXT TO ARABS AND THERE WEREN'T PROBLEMS UNTIL THE STATE OF ISRAEL STARTED SO AGAIN ON THE PALESTINIAN POINT OF VIEW THAT I THINK THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN PARTICULAR ISSUES THEN WHETHER OR NOT THINGS OR ARE ANTI SEMITIC
JERRY BURN INJURIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE IT WAS THE DOOR STEPPING THAT DID FOR KEN LIVINGSTONE ON THURSDAY AND BY ONE OF HIS OWN COLLEAGUES THE LABOUR M.P. JOHN MAN WHO CALLED HIM A RACIST USUALLY IT'S JOURNALISTS DOING THE DOORSTEPPING WITH MIXED RESULTS

LOOKED AS IF SHE'D LOST HER GRIP ON POWER BUT SHE HAD AND TWO DAYS LATER SHE RESIGNED SO THE POINT OF THE DOORSTEP
IS THAT THERE'S SOME CRAZY MISUNDERSTANDING BUT IT THEN ACT AS A METAPHOR KEN LIVINGSTONE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED ON HIS MOBILE PHONE WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON SO JOHN MAN WHO WAS ATTACKING HIM
I THOUGHT HE WASN'T RESPONDING BUT LIVINGSTONE WASN'T RESPONDING BECAUSE HE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED ON HIS MOBILE PHONE BUT THE IMPRESSION WAS
THE LABOUR PARTY'S IN CHAOS AND THAT'S WHERE THE DANGER COMES THAT'S FOR THEM WHY THESE SCENES ARE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF COURSE A PICTURE TELLS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND WET WEATHER THEY PRODUCE ANYTHING UP WE'VE GOT ANOTHER LITTLE CLIP HERE OF MY CORE BEING BEING STRIP DOORSTEP YOU'RE DOORSTEPPED BY SKY

THAT IS LIKE A GREAT BIG NEWS CONFERENCE UM HE'S GOT HIS TALKING TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SO IF HE SAYS GOODBYE TO HER AT A REPORTER IN ACROSS FASHION
THAT IS JUST HOPELESS WHAT DO YOU WHAT HE'S GOT TO DO IS TO WORK OUT DIFFERENT WAYS GETTING INTO BUILDINGS I ONCE CHASED TONY BENN ALL OVER YORKSHIRE DURING THE MINERS' STRIKE BUT TONY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS BEING DOORSTEPPED SO THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
WAS FOR HIM TO FIND SOME OTHER EXITS SO HE'D CLIMB OUT OF WINDOWS OR GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT JUST TO AVOID THIS SCENE BECAUSE TONY BLAIR KNEW VERY EXPERIENCED
HOW DANGEROUS THESE WORTHIES A VERY TRICK HAMMOND AND INDEED YOU FOUND THAT YOURSELF MICHAEL WHEN YOU DOORSTEP GODFREY BLOOM WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE GOT A LITTLE CLIP OF THAT
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FRONT COVER OF THIS YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THE CONFERENCE BROCHURE WITH NO BLACK FACES ON IT

THE PARTY BY HIS GREAT MATE NIGEL FARAGE RATHER SIMILAR ACTUALLY TO THE SITUATION
CORBIN AND LIVINGSTONE WILL BUT IT SHOWED THAT THE ONE OF THESE HAVE TO DO IN A DOORSTEP REALLY IS TO PROVOKE OR REAR
I KNEW IF I ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTION I WOULD GET INTERESTING ANSWER I'D HAVE GONE FOR RUTH I DIDN'T REALISE IT WOULD BE QUITE THAT'S INTERESTING THAT IT WOULD BE YES VIOLENT
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU WORKED WITH YOU REMEMBER JOHN SIMPSON ARE OLD COLLEAGUE BEING TRYING TO INTERVIEW DOORSTEP HAROLD WILSON HE GOT OFF THE TRAIN AT PADDINGTON WALKING DOWN THE STATION JOHN STUCK THEM WILL WILSON PUNCH IN THE STOMACH BUT PUNCHED HIM IN THE STOMACH I MEAN YOU GET THESE VERY ANGRY PEOPLE I WAS IN TOKYO ONCE THE JOHN MAJOR ASKED HIM ABOUT EUROPE WHY NOT THEY WERE CROSS THEY WANTED WANTED ME TO ASK ABOUT JAPAN FOR GOODNESS SAKE
