I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF SUNSHINE AROUND BUT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO SEE IT WELL THAT'LL BOOST THE TEMPERATURES OUT OF THE MID TEENS PERHAPS PUSHING TOWARDS TWENTY DEGREES OR SO I THINK THERE'S A BETTER CHANCE OF THAT PERHAPS IN THE SOUTH EAST YES THERE'S THE ODD SHOWER AROUND AT THE MOMENT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE SOUTH EAST WILL ESCAPE THE WORST OF THESE DURING THIS MORNING AND CERTAINLY THIS AFTERNOON YOU WILL BE DRIER THAN SOME AND THAT LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH I ASSURE YOU

THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS CLEMENT FREUD CHILD ABUSE IS THE HEADLINE ON THE DAILY MAIL WITH THE NEWS THAT TWO WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO CLAIM THAT THE LATE BROADCASTER FORMER M.P. LIBERAL M.P. MOLESTED THEM THE CLAIMS ARE MADE IN A DOCUMENTARY THAT IS BEING BROADCAST TONIGHT IT'S ALSO A STORY THAT'S PICKED UP ON THE FRONT OF THE TELEGRAPH
CLEMENT FREUD THE CHILD ABUSER HE DIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SEAT SPENT YEARS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH ABUSING A GIRL WHO ME BROUGHT UP AS A DAUGHTER AND VIOLENT RAPE TO TEETER TEENAGER WHILE HE WAS AN M.P. HIS WIDOW HAS APOLOGISED TO HIS VICTIMS THE MAIN STORY ACROSS MOST OF THE FRONT PAGES IS THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE FINANCIAL TIME SWING TO IT FUELS TURMOIL THE PROSPECT OF BRITAIN'S VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. NEXT WEEK
FUELLED GLOBAL MARKET UPHEAVAL YESTERDAY IT SAYS WITH INVESTORS RUSHING TO SAFETY BOTH THE GUARDIAN AND THE TIMES LEAD ON THE BRICKS IT BUDGET WHICH IS TO BE PRESENTED BY GEORGE OSBORNE AND HIS LABOUR PREDECESSOR ALISTAIR DARLING TODAY MISTER OSBORNE WILL THREATEN TO PUT TWO P. ON THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX RAISED FEEL DO SEIZED SLOT SLASH SPENDING ON HEALTH EDUCATION DEFENCE AND
MENTIONS THE COMMITTEE AND POINTS OUT THAT BREAKS AT SPORTING CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS HAVE SAID OSBORNE'S CREDIBILITY WOULD BE DAMAGED BY INITIATING WHAT THEY CALLED A PUNISHMENT BUDGET IN RESPONSE TO A BRECK'S IT IN A SIGN OF THE POTENTIAL TORY REBELLION THAT OSBORNE COULD FACE IF HE DOES TRY TO DRIVE THROUGH THE EMERGENCY MEASURES A STEVE BAKER A PROMINENT OR LEAVE CAMPAIGN AN M.P. SAID THAT HE WOULD REFUSE TO BACK CUTS TO THE N.H.S. OR TAX RISES FOR HARD WORKING FAMILIES
ALL THE PAPERS PICK UP ON THE FEARS ABOUT FURTHER VIOLENCE IN FRANCE NOT LEAST IN LEGAL BECAUSE ALTHOUGH RUSSIA IS PLAYING TODAY ENGLAND IS PLAYING NEAR IN NEARBY LON'S TOMORROW SO THERE ARE PLENTY OF FANS IN LEO AT THE MOMENT FROM BOTH ENGLAND AND RUSSIA AND THERE'S A BAN ON ALCOHOL SALES AND SHOPS AND SUPERMARKETS WILL
RUN UNTIL SIX A.M. ON FRIDAY SUCH ARE THE FEARS AND ALL THE PAPERS PICKED UP ABOUT THE MAST RUSSIAN GANGS HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER ASSAULT WITH RUSSIAN HOOLIGANS ATTACKING ENGLAND AND WALES FOUND
THE TIME IS TEN PAST SIX THE LATER M.P. AND BROADCASTER SIR CLEMENT FREUD HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY TWO WOMEN HAVE SEXUAL ABUSE ONE OF THEM SYLVIA WAS LEE MET FREUD A FAMILY FRIEND WHEN SHE WAS TEN NOW IN HER LATE SEVENTIES SHE TOLD I.T.V.'S EXPOSURE PROGRAMME ABOUT THE ABUSE I WAS FEELING
SOMETHING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I DIDN'T I'D MY DIDN'T REACT IN ANY WAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE MY WORD THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY BECAUSE HE WAS NICE STEWY
HE WAS REALLY A DULL TOO GROWN UP AN OLDER CHILD SO YOU KNOW I BE STILL
CLAY LOVES YOU THAT'S ALL I HEARD ALL THE TIME SYLVIE WAS HE ALSO DESCRIBED HOW FREUD'S ACTIONS HAVE AFFECTED HER HE DESTROYED SOMETHING IN ME THAT BROKE
I SUPPOSE IT'S AFFECTED MY BEHAVIOUR
BEEN MARRIED TWICE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH
A LACK OF TRUST BY LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE MY DEST SELF DESTRUCTION ANOTHER WOMAN WHO HAS CHOSEN TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS SAID FREUD ABUSED HER AS A CHILD AND RAPED HER WHEN SHE WAS EIGHTEEN AND SHE TOLD EXPOSURE ABOUT ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT HAD HAPPENED FOUR YEARS EARLIER HER WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY AN ACTOR
PROMISING TO COOK ESPECIALLY FOR US HE INVITED A GIRLFRIEND NICE SELF TO HIS HOME DURING A TOUR OF THE HOUSE HE TRIED TO LOCK US INTO HIS BASEMENT BEDROOM I CANNOT ENTIRELY REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID BUT IT WAS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET NAKED AND HAVE SOME FUN MY FRIEND ALSO FOURTEEN WAS MUCH MORE SAVVY THAN I WAS AND EMPOWERED ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO GET LOST HE JUST LAUGHED IT OFF
SIR CLEMENTS WIDOW JILL WHO SONIA WAS LEE BELIEVES KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ABUSE HAS RESPONDED TO THE PROGRAMME SAYING THIS IS A VERY SAD DAY FOR ME I WAS MARRIED TO CLEMENT FOR FIFTY EIGHT YEARS AND LOVED HIM DEARLY I'M SHOCKED DEEPLY SADDENED AND PROFOUNDLY SORRY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THESE WOMEN I SINCERELY HOPE THEY WILL NOW HAVE SOME PEACE THE PROGRAMME EXPOSURE IS ON I.T.V. ONE AT ELEVEN OH FIVE TONIGHT
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX SHOULD SOMEONE WITH A BUGGY ON A BUS HAVE TO MAKE WAY FOR SOMEONE IN A WHEELCHAIR THE SUPREME COURT WILL START CONSIDERING THE ANSWER TO THAT TODAY CLIVE COLEMAN HAS MORE AND CLIVE IT'S THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE IT'S GONE ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THE OTHER COURTS
WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS THIS IS REALLY BASICALLY A STORY ABOUT A MAN GETTING ON A BUS OR AT LEAST TRYING TO THE MAN IS DUG POORLY AND IN TWENTY TWELVE HE TRIED TO BOARD A BUS IN WETHERBY TO GO TO LEEDS BUT THERE WAS A LADY WITH A CHILD'S BUGGY IN THE ONLY DESIGNATED WHEELCHAIR SPACE ON THE BUS THE DRIVER ASKED HER TO MOVE SHE REFUSED TO DO SO IT'S HER DOG POORLY
COULDN'T GET ON THAT BUS NOW HE SUED THE BUS OPERATOR FIRST GROUP P.L.C. HE WON A RULING INITIALLY THAT THEIR POLICY OF REQUESTING BUT NOT REQUIRING OTHER WORDS ASKING BUT NOT MAKING ABLE BODIED PEOPLE MOVE FROM THE DISABLED SPACE
THAT THAT WAS UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION SHOULD SAY THAT UNDER THE EQUALITY ACT AT SARAH ANYONE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC MUST MAKE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE DISABLED MY IT WAS INITIALLY AWARDED FIVE AND A HALF THOUSAND COMPENSATION AND FIRST GROUP WAS GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO CHANGE ITS POLICY BUT THEY APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEAL AND THE JUDGEMENT INITIALLY MISTER PAULY'S FAVOUR THE ORIGINAL JUDGEMENT WAS REVERSED BY THE COURT OF APPEAL
IT RULED THAT ALTHOUGH WHEELCHAIR USERS HAVE PRIORITY TO OCCUPY THE WHEELCHAIR SPACE THERE'S NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR BUS DRIVERS TO MOVE OTHER PASSENGERS FROM IT SO THIS WHAT'S BEEN DUBBED BY SOME OF THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE WHEELCHAIR IN THE BUGGY FINALLY ARRIVES AT THE SUPREME COURT TODAY AND IF THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN HIS FAVOUR WE COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WHAT THE DRIVER OF A BUS WILL HAVE TO COME BACK AND THROW A MOTHER WITH HER BABY OFF
YES I MEAN IN THE COURT OF APPEAL THERE ALL SORTS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE FACT THE DRIVERS AREN'T EMPOWERED TO DO THAT THEY MIGHTN'T RUN FOUL OF THE CRIMINAL LAW IF THEY WERE TO DO SO BUT WHAT IT WOULD AMOUNT TO I THINK IS THIS THAT THEY WOULD TURN THE BUS COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES OF REQUESTING BUT NOT REQUIRING THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY WILL EFFECTIVELY THROW PASSENGERS OFF THE BUS OR CERTAINLY WAIT UNTIL THOSE PASSENGERS LEAVE THE BUS AND DID THAT FOR INSTANCE IF THEY'RE CARRYING EXTRAORDINARY LARGE
PARCELS THAT SORT OF THING IF THEY'RE CAUSING TROUBLE SO WATCH IS BEING SOUGHT BY MY POORLY IS A CHANGE IN THE POLICY AND IF HE'S SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD HAVE BIG IMPLICATIONS I THINK FOR PASTA AND TRAIN COMPANIES AROUND THE COUNTRY I SHOULD SAY BY THE WAY THIS IS THE FIRST DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CASE INVOLVING THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC THAT HAS REACHED THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN VERY EAGERLY WATCHED CLIVE COMMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX ROLLS ROYCE HAS WRITTEN TO EMPLOYEES THIS MORNING SAYING IT WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS THAT IN THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS MORNING DOMINIC THANKS MICHELLE RURAL THRICE IS PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS NAME AND BRITISH ENGINEERING AND STILL ACCOUNTS FOR ONE POUND AND EVERY FIFTY OF BRITISH EXPORTS I SPOKE YESTERDAY TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WARREN EAST
HERE HAVE THE ROLLS ROYCE FACILITY IN DERBY YOU MIGHT HEAR RUTH AND KNOW HOW
THAT'S THE NOISE OF ONE OF THE GIANT AERO ENGINE TO TIS FACILITIES
ALSO IT COULD USE ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE HERE AT DERBY BUT THAT'S UNDER THREAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAYS BECAUSE OF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE EUROPE THAT KIND OF A BASEMENT DECISION WILL BE PUT ON HOLD
WARREN EAST I'M CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROLLS ROYCE WARREN YOU ROLLS ROYCE'S WRITTEN TODAY TO ITS EMPLOYEES TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BRITAIN STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS
THAT THE PRIMARY REASON IS WE BELIEVE IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SUPPLIERS IF WE REMAIN
IF BRITAIN REMAINS PART OF EUROPE THIS IS COS WE'RE VERY INTERCONNECTED OPERATION ACROSS EUROPE WE HAVE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN EUROPE HALF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE IN THE U.K. ANOTHER QUARTER OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN MAINLAND EUROPE A LOT OF OUR EXTERNAL SUPPLIERS IN EUROPE
BIG CUSTOMERS BIG AIRLINE AIRCRAFT PARTNERS LIKE LIKE AIRBUS AND IF BRECK'S IT OCCURS THEY WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY
AND UNCERTAINTY IS WHAT WE CAN'T COPE WITH WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING SERIOUS INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND WIT WITH ALL OF THAT INTERCONNECT IN OPERATION AROUND THOSE DECISIONS ARE COMPETITORS BASED IN THE U.S. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT UNCERTAINTY
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US SIR A CONCRETE EXAMPLE YOU CAN GIVE OF AN INVESTMENT DECISION THERE MIGHT BE PUT ON HOLD OR ENDANGERED
IF BRITAIN WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE WELL FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE STANDING HERE IN THIS PRODUCTION FACILITY WHERE WERE ASSEMBLING OUR LATEST ENGINES FOR THE NEW AIRBUS A. THREE
PRODUCTION VOLUMES ARE RAMPING VERY STEEPLY AT THE MOMENT AND INDEED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT WE WON'T NEED SORT OF SOME FORM OF EXTRA CAPACITY AS WE RAMP
THREE HUNDRED ENGINES A YEAR LAST YEAR TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED ENGINES IN A FEW YEARS' TIME WHERE WE PLAY SOME OF THAT INCREMENTAL CAPACITY FOR TESTING WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET AND THERE'LL BE A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS
BUT FOR SURE SOME FORM OF OF INFLUENCE AND FORMER FUNDING FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDING WE GET GOVERNMENT FUNDING FROM THE U.K. WE GET GOVERNMENT FUNDING FROM EUROPE WE GET GOVERNMENT FUNDING PERHAPS FROM FROM THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SAY NO THAT'S GOING TO BE A FACTOR THAT INFLUENCES OUR DECISION AND JUST HAVING THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHETHER
SOME OF THAT'S HAPPENING WHAT THE RULES ARE AROUND THAT IS GOING TO IMPACT OUR DECISION AND DELAY CAN BE A BAD THING
YOU'RE NOT SAYING SO MUCH THAT IT DEFINITELY WON'T HAPPEN IN THE U.K.
IF THERE WAS BRICKS IT WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THE DECISION WOULD GO ON HOLD AND YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER FACTORS IT CAME INTO PLAY
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY THERE PUTTING DECISIONS ON HOLD THAT IS THE PROBLEM IT'S SOMETHING OUR COMPETITORS
BUSINESS INVESTMENT DECISIONS A CONTINUOUS PART OF WHAT WE DO
AND IF WE'RE OUT OF THOSE DECISIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN OUR COMPETITORS ARE IN THOSE DECISIONS IS IT'S LIKE RUNNING A MULTI LAP RACE
WITH EACH LAP A COMPETITOR HAS EIGHT OR TEN YARDS
AND YOU CAN TOLERATE THAT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT NOT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
THAT WAS WARREN EAST THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROLLS ROYCE AND WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM AFTER SEVEN A.M. ON THE PROGRAMME TONY NOW TO B.H.S. AND ITS FORMER OWNER OF THE BILLIONAIRE SIR PHILIP GREEN IS DUE TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM PEACE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE SALE AND COLLAPSE OF THE COMPANY SIR PHILIP SOLD BRITISH HOME STORES TO RETAIL ACQUISITIONS OF LAST YEAR FOR JUST ONE POUND BUT BY APRIL THIS YEAR B.H.S. WAS IN HER MINISTRATIONS ANNOUNCE IN LIQUIDATION WITH ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK
DOMINIC SHH APPELLE THEIR HEAD OF RETAIL ACQUISITIONS HAS ALREADY APOLOGISED FOR HIS ROLE
AND YOU KNOW I AM VERY
BUT THERE ARE ELEVEN THOUSAND
DIRECTLY AND NUMBER OF THOUSAND PEOPLE INDIRECTLY WHO NOW HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND IT IS A TRAVESTY
VERY UPSET THAT THIS HAPPENED AND IT WAS A VOID
FOR THE RECORD IS THAT AN APOLOGY THAT IS ENOUGH
I UNDERSTAND SIR PHILIP WILL TODAY SAY HE'S HAPPY TO PUT MY MONEY INTO THE PAINT SCHEME BUT THAT IS NOT PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE THE SUM IN PUBLIC WITH THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS B.H.S. I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY ATOMIC FAIL IT OR PINSON'S RESEARCH FOR HARGREAVES LANDS DOWN WHILE ALISON STEWART PELHAM HIT OF THE SCUSE ME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PARTNERS A BUSINESS CONSULTANT HE JOINS US FROM OUR STUDIO IN WESTMINSTER
GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH TOM CAN I START WITH YOU COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT WITH THE B.H.S. PICTURE SO THE PENSION SCHEME STILL HAS ALL OF ITS ASSETS HE'D STILL ON A DAILY BASIS PAYING PENSIONS OUT TO ITS RETIRED MEMBERS IT'S MANAGING THAT PORTFOLIO OF MONEY BUT THERE IS THIS RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE LONG TERM TO MEET ALL OF ITS LIABILITIES SO IN THE MEANTIME IT IS NOW BEING ASSESSED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND AND THE CONCLUSION OF THAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS WHICH COULD TAKE SOME
CONSIDER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME WOULD BE THAT THE PENSION SCHEME WOULD BE PASSED OVER ULTIMATELY TO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WHICH WOULD THEN TAKE ON ALL OF THE ASSET AND THE LIABILITIES AND WE TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTINUED PAYMENT OF PEOPLE'S PENSIONS THE MEMBERS
ANYONE RETIRING FROM HERE FROM NOW ON AND INTO THE FUTURE WE'LL SEE A MODEST REDUCTION IN THEIR PENSION BENEFITS WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN A BIT OF A CUT AND THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE THE NEGOTIATION IS ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE MONEY CAN BE PUT INTO THAT PROCESS AND AT SIR FOR THAT WAS TO PUT MONEY IN OTHER RELEASE OTHER ANY INDICATORS OUT THERE AS TO HOW MUCH
IT WOULD HE WOULD HAVE TO PUT HIM TO TO DO BETTER THAN THE P. P. F. AS IT WERE SO THE SUGGESTION FROM THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND IS THAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A SUM IN THE REGION OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS THE FINAL FIGURE MIGHT BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THAT BUT IT'S THAT KIND OF BALL PARK THAT CLEARLY IS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN ANY SUGGESTIONS WE HAD FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN HERE THUS FAR AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE NEGOTIATIONS GOING TO STAYING KEN THEY FORCE HIM TO PAY UP
GOOD QUESTION THE PENSIONS REGULATOR CAN PURSUE THIS YOU FINANCIAL SUPPORT DIRECTIONS TO FORMER OWNERS OF BUSINESSES THERE IS A PRECEDENT FOR THAT KIND OF INTERVENTION
IF HE IS UNWILLING IF HE'D JUST CONCLUDE THAT HIS BEST INTEREST SULTAN HAD TO GO DOWN FIGHTING THAN IT COULD BE QUITE A PROTRACTED PROCESS AND PINNING IT ON HIM COULD BE QUITE CHALLENGING SO I THINK TODAY'S PUBLIC HEARING AND HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION WILL BE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THIS
THANK YOU TOM TURNING NOW TO ALISON ALISON BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE COLLAPSE OF THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS BUT I SEE THE B.H.S. STORY GOES BACK A LONG WAY DOESN'T IT YES IT DOES I MEAN THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE A HIGH STREET RETAILER IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION AS WE SAY IN MY BUSINESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PROMISING TO THE CONSUMER IF YOU'RE IN THAT MIDDLE GROUND
WHICH B.H.S. HAS BEN IAN AND ALL AROUND YOU THE COMPETITION IS INTENSIFYING YOUR FINDING ONLINE RETAILERS BEING INNOVATIVE YOU'RE FINDING THOSE ABOVE AND BELOW YOU IN TERMS OF PRICING A CONSISTENTLY INNOVATING AND YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE AND YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT YOU ARE LOST AND YOU'RE IN THAT NO MAN'S LAND SPACE THE B.H.S. HAS BEEN IN FOR SOME TIME SO THIS IS NOT A BIG SHARK THAT B.H.S. AS HAVING
PROBLEMS V.H.S.S HAD THEN EXPERIENCING YOU KNOW ISSUES FOR SOME TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THAT SPACE IN THE MIDDLE AND NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY STAND FOR AND ALISON WHAT ABOUT THE BROADER PICTURE WHAT DOES THIS DO FOR THE IMAGE OF BRITISH BUSINESS WITH HAD WITH HER BUSINESS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THREATS TO KILL BEFORE A SELECT COMMITTEE ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF
IT'S NOT GREAT IS IT IT'S REALLY NOT YOU KNOW THE VIEW OF BUSINESS IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW NOW IN THE U.K. AND IN MANY PARTS OF FIRST WORLD ECONOMIES AND IF ANYTHING BUSINESSES NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE A FORCE FOR GOOD THAT THEY HAVE THE INTERESTS OF THEIR BROADER STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AT HEART NOT JUST THE OWNERS BUT THE EMPLOYEES THE SUPPLIERS
THE CUSTOMERS AND ALL OF THE OTHER PUBLIC STEP THEY SERVE AND THERE IS AN EXPECTATION INCREASINGLY THAT BUSINESS DOES PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE INTERESTS AND INTAKE DAY IS MORE THAN JUST TOKEN GESTURES THAT THESE ARE QUITE MEANINGFUL WAYS THAT BUSINESSES WE PROVE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE HEART OF OTHER ACTIVITIES
ALISON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS ALISON STEWART ON THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL MARKING PARTNERS AND PINKS WHO'D ATOMIC FAIL HERE OF PINSON'S RESEARCH AT HARGREAVES' LANDS DOWN
TURNING NOW TO THE MARKETS AND JOINING US FROM EDINBURGH IS COLIN MACLEAN MANAGING DIRECTOR OF S.P. ASSET MANAGEMENT COLUMN QUITE A TURBULENT DAY IN THE MARKET SYSTOLE THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FINISHING DOWN TWO PER CENT WE'RE INVESTORS TURNING FOR SAFE HAVENS
IT LOOKS AS IF FOR TURNING TO GOVERNMENT BONDS FOR ABSOLUTE SAFETY IN PARTICULAR WE'VE SEEN THE GERMAN TENURE BONZO BOONE'S MOVE INTO NEGATIVE RATES OF COURSE COST MONEY TO OR NUMB THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED SAFE ALTHOUGH IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY THAT SAFE
THIS IS GOOD THIS IS QUITE AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT OF GERMAN GOVERNMENT DEBT THE IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT A GUARANTEED LOSS THAT DOESN'T SO MUCH SMARTER AND LISTENING TO ME
THEY KNOW IT'S PERHAPS INDICATES JUST HOW WORRIED PEOPLE ARE ABOUT SHARES PATRICIANS ALSO HOLDING A LOT OF CASH BUT THE AND SAY WILL END UP COSTING INVESTORS OF INFLATION RETURNED SO THEY COULD PROVE TO BE FAR FROM A SAFE INVESTMENT IT GOES TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SO FEARFUL OF MARKETS IN GENERAL DOESN'T IT AND IT'S NOT JUST BRICKS AT THAT'S MAKING PEOPLE FEARFUL
NO I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT THEY HAVE THIS DATE PRICE POINTS TO IS DEFLATION FORCES INTERNATIONALLY WE SEE AMERICAN COMPANIES CUTTING COSTS REFUSING TO HIRE A FOLLOWING COMMODITY PRICES IN GENERAL AND THE BENCH RECENTLY
AND ALL OF THIS POINTS TO A LACK OF INFLATION GLOBALLY AND IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SEXUAL ABANDON BONDS WRITTEN ON THAT STAYING WITH THAT THEME THAT LACK OF INFLATION WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE FIDDLE RESERVE TO DO LATER TODAY WE HAVE AN INTEREST RATE DECISION OUT FROM AND THEY WERE THE FIRST OF THE BIG ECONOMIES TO INCREASE INTEREST RATES AFTER THE AFTER THE CRISIS SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY PERHAPS
I THINK WORD NOT GOING TO GET AN AWFUL LOT OF GUIDANCE I THINK THE LAST COMMENTS WE HAD FROM THE CHAIR WERE QUITE CONFUSING IT CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AS IF SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT BREAKS IT BUT ALSO CONCERNED I THINK ABOUT QUITE WEAK U.S. JOB NUMBERS THAT WE'VE HAD SO THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE POINT TO AN EMINENT RICE JUST NOW BUT SHE NEEDS TO HOLD OPEN THE PROSPECT MAYBE LATER IN THE YEAR AND COLUMN BRICKS IT WAS MEANT TO
ALL THERE ALL TAKEOVER DEALS IN THE PREMIER FUNNEL NOT QUITE A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT STILL A WELL KNOWN BRITISH ENGINEER LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO FALL TO THE GERMANS ANOTHER ONE FOR ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION POUNDS
YES THIS HAS BEEN A COMPANY THAT'S HAD TWO PROFIT WARNINGS IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO THAT'S JUST TAKES THE PRICE BACK UP TO PERHAPS HE WOULD WORK WITH IT WAS A YEAR OR SO AGO BUT IT HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING BRITISH BUSINESS HE WAS PERHAPS TALK TO MY MARRIAGE WITH ANOTHER BRITISH ONE AND THERE'S THE CAESAR MOVE OVERSEAS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLIN MACLEAN MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THIS ASSET MANAGEMENT

M.P.S WILL GET THE CHANCE TO QUESTION THE FORMER BOSS OF B.H.S. SIR PHILIP GREEN ABOUT THE COMPANY'S COLLAPSE LATER TODAY THERE'LL BE ASKED ABOUT THE SALE OF B.H.S. TO A FORMER BANKRUPT ITS PENSION DEFICIT AND THE DIVIDENDS HE AND HIS FAMILY TOOK FROM THE BITTERNESS
THE N.S.P.C.C. HE SAYS A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING STRIPPED OF THEIR CHILDHOODS THROUGH WATCHING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES ON THE INTERNET THE CHARITY SAYS HALF OF ALL THE ELEVEN TO SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO TOOK PART IN A SURVEY THAT VIEW TO PORNOGRAPHY
THE TIME IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE CHANCELLOR WILL WARM TODAY THAT A VOTE FOR BRICKS IT WOULD LEAD TO AN EMERGENCY BUDGET INVOLVING BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS ARE ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH IS ON THE LINE A SIGN THEY'RE WORRIED NORMAN
MAYBE BUT I THINK IT'S MORE A DETERMINATION TO KEEP HAMMERING HOME WHAT THEY CLAIM IS THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF BRECHT'S IT WITH THE CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING TODAY'S SETTING OUT EMERGENCY BUDGET WHICH THEY SAY WOULD BE NECESSARY WITHIN WEEKS BECAUSE OF A PROJECTED HEAD TO THE PUBLIC FINANCES ARE BETWEEN TWENTY AND FORTY BILLION FORECAST BY GROUPS LIKE THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES AND SO THEY SET OUT THE CHOICES THEY BELIEVE WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE
WHICH WOULD INVOLVE FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF TAX RISE AS THEY SAY IN FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF SPENDING CUTS INVOLVING DECISIONS SUCH AS PUTTING TWO P. ON THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX THREE P. ON THE HIGHER RATE FIVE PENCE ON INHERITANCE TAX INCREASES IN ROAD AND ALCOHOL DUTIES AND IN TERMS OF CUTS THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS TO PROTECT KEY DEPARTMENTS WOULD HAVE TO BE TORN UP SO THAT HAVE TO BE TWO PER CENT CUTS TO THE N.H.S. DEFENCE SCHOOLS A TWO BILLION POUND HIT TWO PENSIONS
AND YOU KNOW ALMOST BEFORE THEY'VE SAID IT OF COURSE I WILL BE THE OUTCRY OF HERE WE GO AGAIN PROJECT FEAR ON STEROIDS
THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS IS PROJECT REALITY THEY SAY BUT IN CAMPAIGN TERMS I THINK THEY TAKE THE VIEW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY DESPITE THE SQUALLS AROUND IMMIGRATION THE ECONOMY WILL WIN THROUGH IS THE KEY ISSUE BECAUSE IT ALWAYS DOES IN ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUMS AND I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT
THE PREVIOUS IF YOU LIKE BOSSY AS WARNING OF DIRE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TO SOME EXTENT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT THEORETICAL POINTING ABOUT A NOTIONAL HIT TO PUBLIC FINANCES IN FIFTEEN YEARS' TIME A POSSIBLE DETERIORATION IN HOUSE PRICES
THIS BUDGET IS SOMETHING THEY SAY WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN WEEKS SO IT'S A MUCH MORE IMMEDIATE IMPACT TO FAMILY FINANCES COULD THERE BE ANYTHING MORE ANYTHING THEY COULD SAY ON THE IMMIGRATION SIDE THEY'VE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY REMAIN CAMPAIGN WOULD BE WILLING TO OFFER OR SUGGEST ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY A DISCUSSION AND DEBATE IN THE REMAIN SIDE I THINK
FROM DOWNING STREET'S PERSPECTIVE THEY DO NOT WANT TO OPEN THE LID ON LOOKING AT FREE MOVEMENT CHANGING THEIR STANCE ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE SET THE COURSE ON THE ECONOMY AND ARE GOING TO KEEP HAMMERING HOME ON THAT DAY AFTER DAY ON THE LABOUR SIDE THERE IS
A DIVISION IT SEEMS TO ME BETWEEN SOME IN THE SHADOW CABINET AROUND JEREMY CORBIN WHO BELIEVE THAT FREE MOVEMENT IS PART OF THE DEAL FOR BEING PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET UNDER ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO TRY AND RE VISITED AND THEN OTHER FIGURES LIKE TOM WATSON AND ANDY BURNHAM WHO BELIEVE THE GUT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS TO SIGNAL ITS READINESS TO LOOK AGAIN AT FREE MOVEMENT AS A WAY OF SIGNALLING TO ITS SUPPORTERS THAT IT UNDERSTANDS THEY CONCERNS THAT SERIOUS ABOUT THEM
AND IS WILLING TO LOOK AT SORT OF NEW MEASURES THE DIFFICULTY OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE YEARS DOWN THE LINE BEFORE YOU GOT A FUTURE PUTATIVE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND WITH ONLY DAYS TO GO IT'S VERY LATE TO START TO TRY AND RE PRESENT YOURSELF ON IMMIGRATION UNBELIEVE SIDE A NORMAN A LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME BEING TALKED ABOUT TODAY
WE GET TODAY FROM THE LEE SIDE THEIR TIMETABLE AND LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR DISENTANGLING US FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD BE VOTE FOR BRECHT'S IT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT
IT IS ALMOST A SORT OF A MINI QUEEN SPEECH WITH SIX BILLS SETTING OUT MEASURES SUCH AS ENDING THE JURISDICTION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT ENDING FREE MOVEMENT TOLL FREE ACCESS FOR A EUROPEAN CITIZENS
AND THEY SOUND INCREASINGLY ALMOST LIKE A SORT OF BRECHT'S IT GOVERNMENT IN WAITING AND THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO RUSH INTO A DEAL UNDER SO CALLED ARTICLE FIFTY WHICH SUGGESTS IT WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE DONE AND DUSTED WITHIN TWO YEARS WHICH OF COURSE GIVES MASSIVE BARGAINING POWER TO THE E.U. THEY SAY THERE'LL BE NO RUSH IT CAN YOU CAN GET IT DONE BY THE TIME OF THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION CRUCIALLY THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE THEY COULD GET A NEW TRADE DEAL AS WELL BY THE TIME OF THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION IN TWENTY TWENTY
FOR THE REMAIN INSIDE THE CHANCELLOR WILL BE HERE TALKING TO US LIVE AT TEN PAST EIGHT NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU THE IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN RUSSIA'S PLAYING SLOVAKIA IN THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP IN LIL THIS AFTERNOON AND IF THERE'S ANY TROUBLE FROM THE RUSSIAN FANS THE TEAM WILL BE KICKED OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT VICTOR NICKY'S IN IS FROM THE B.

WELL YOU COULD SAY SOIL WITH IT DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IT DOESN'T HAVE A CERTAIN I DON'T KNOW YES YOU TO ATTRIBUTE
TO DEAL WITH BUT OF COURSE THEY'RE ALWAYS FUN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THERE WAS A DIFFERENT GROUPS OR FAIRS WHY SHOULD FOOTBALL FRIENDS SOME OF THEM ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE WELL REAL HOOLIGANS
WE SEE AND PULLEY IS WELL LEARN TO DEAL WITH THEM THEY'RE THE MOST
THE MOST THE BIGGEST PROBABLY PROBLEMS WITH FOOTBALL FANS WEAR LIKE TEN YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO WITH THAT MANY PEOPLE NOW ASKING WHERE THE
AGGRESSIVE HOOLIGANS IN MY SEA KING FROM ACTUALLY ACQUIRE V. AND I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR WAY EVEN COLLECTED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF RUSSIA SOLD TO FORM THIS ORGANISE GROUP OF HOOLIGANS AND TO SEND IT
VICTOR NICKY'S IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN REPORTS FROM FLORIDA SUGGESTS THAT THE WIFE OF THE ORLANDO GUNMEN OH MAMA TEAM COULD BE CHARGED OVER THE NIGHTCLUB ATTACK IN WHICH HE KILLED FORTY NINE PEOPLE ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO AS IN ORLANDO
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THE F.B.I. ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER TO GIVE THE TECHNICAL TERM SHE WAS GUILTY OF A MISS PRISSY IAN I'VE A FELONY IN OTHER WORDS SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND DIDN'T TELL THE AUTHORITIES AND SO IT SEEMS THAT ACCORDING TO JUDICIAL SOURCES
SHE ACCOMPANIED HIM ON A NUMBER OF TRIPS THAT HE MADE TO THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB AND ALSO TO THE DISNEY SPRINGS COMPLEX WHERE IT SEEMS EARLIER THIS MONTH HE ALSO WENT A COUPLE OF TIMES TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND
THE SAME SOURCES ARE SAYING THAT THERE IS C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE OF HER DROPPING HIM OFF OUTSIDE THE NIGHTCLUB PRESUMABLY POSSIBLY IT'S A SCOOP IT FOR SOME KIND OF ATTACK
THAT IS WHAT THE F.B.I. ARE INVESTIGATING BUT SHE'S SAYING SHE DIDN'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT HE WAS PLANNING TO DO ALTHOUGH SHE WAS
AWARE THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME IDEA IN HIS MIND TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK IN THAT SHE WAS DOING HER BEST TO DISSUADE HIM OF IT AND THE F.B.I. ARE TRYING TO SIFT THIS EVIDENCE TO WORK OUT WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN ANY CRIMINAL OFFENCE COMMITTED AT THE SAME TIME THE POLITICS PLAYING OUT IN THE BACKGROUND INCLUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA TALKING WILL PRESUMABLY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
YES THERE WAS NO MISTAKES HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TALKING AT ONE STAGE TALKING OPENLY ABOUT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE BUT AT OTHER TIMES TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO GO ON TO TWITTER AND MAKE A LOT OF NOISE I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY DONALD TRUMP AND HE SAID HE WAS I WAS REALLY STRUCK LISTENING TO THE SPEECH BECAUSE IT HADN'T BEEN BILLED AS ANYTHING PARTICULAR THAT JUST HOW ANGRY HE WAS
WITH DONALD TRUMP AND THE WAY HE WAS FRASER GET IN THE WAY HE TACKLED HIM HEAD ON OVER DONALD TRUMP'S CRITICISM AND DEMAND THAT THE PRESIDENT RESIGNED FOR REFUSING TO USE THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM
AND BARACK OBAMA COUNTED THERE IS NO MAGIC TO THE PHRASE ISLAMIC RADICAL ISLAM IT'S A POLITICAL TALKING POINT AND HE WENT UP THE REASON I'M CAREFUL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH DEFEATING EXTREMISM AND HE WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ARGUING WAS UN AMERICAN ESSENTIALLY THAT YOU CANNOT JUST
BAN A WHOLE RELIGION AND DEMONISE A WHOLE RELIGION BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF A FEW PEOPLE DONALD TRUMP AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IT BEING DONALD TRUMP HASN'T TAKEN IT LYING DOWN HE SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA SEEMS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN HE DOES WITH THE PERPETRATOR OF THE ATTACKING ORLANDO JOHN SO PAUL THANK YOU
ARE NORTH AMERICA EDITOR REPORTING FROM ORLANDO AND MEANWHILE WE'RE ALSO HEARING FROM ORLANDO THAT THE AUTHORITIES THERE ARE SEARCHING FOR A TWO YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS DRAGGED INTO THE WATER BY AN ALLIGATOR NEAR DISNEY'S GRAND FOR RHYDIAN RESORT AND SPA THE SHERIFF OF ORANGE COUNTY HAS SAID THAT THE FAMILY WAS ON VACATION AT THE TIME AND WADING IN A LAKE WHEN THE ATTACK HAPPENED LAST NIGHT
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND WHEN SIR CLEMENT FREUD DIED THE TELEGRAPH RECALLS HIS FUNERAL WAS PACKED WITH POLITICIANS POP STARS AND MEDIA PRESENTERS FROM GORDON BROWN TO BORROW IT SAYS THEY WERE THERE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO A FORMER M.P. CELEBRATED AS A WIT A RACONTEUR AND A CHEF NOW THE DAILY MIRROR DESCRIBED HIM AS A PREDATORY PAEDO THE SUN HARLOTS THE APOLOGY HIS WIDOW HAS MADE TO ONE WOMAN WHO SAYS THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER THROUGHOUT HER TEENAGE YEARS
THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS HOW SIR CLEMENT STRUCK UP AN UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIP WITH THE PARENTS OF MADELEINE MCCANN HE HAD A VILLA IN THE PORTUGUESE RESORT FROM WHICH SHE WAS ABDUCTED AND SUPPORTED THEM IN THE AFTERMATH THE PAPERS SUGGEST IN THE CANS WILL BE APPALLED BY THE REVELATIONS MADE IN THE I.T.V. PROGRAMME ABOUT HIM WHICH HAS BEEN BROADCAST
WRITING IN THE TIMES GEORGE OSBORNE AND ALISTAIR DARLING EXPLAIN WHY THEY HAVE SET ASIDE CONVENTIONAL PARTY POLITICS TO PUT A PRICE ON THE CONSEQUENCES IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. THEY SAY WITHDRAWAL WOULD BE A COSTLY LEAP IN THE DARK AND ALL OF IT CAN BE AVOIDED THEIR WARNING IS ANGRILY DISMISSED BY THE MALE WHICH ADDS HIS FORECAST TO A LIST OF PREDICTIONS FROM PROJECT FEAR THAT BRICKS IT WILL BRING GENOCIDE WAR RECESSION MIGRANT CAMPS IN KENT HOUSE PRICE COLLAPSE
AND THE END OF CHEAP HOLIDAYS NOT FOR A MINUTE OR DECLARES DOES THE MALE EXCEPT THEY'RE LUDICROUSLY BLEAK PROGNOSIS FOR THE FUTURE PHILIP JOHNSTON AT THE TELEGRAPH ARGUES THAT THE PERILS OF STAYING IN THE E.U. ARE GREATER THAN THE RISK OF LEAVING BUT IN THE GUARDIAN RAFFAELLA DISPUTES THAT MAKING THE CASE FOR HIM PERFECT COMPROMISE AND COLLABORATION ISN'T EASY HE WRITES IT INVOLVES TELLING ANGRY PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE WHAT THEY WANT CERTAINTIES OF THE PAST ARE LOST AND THE JOURNEY TO A BETTER FUTURE REQUIRES PATIENCE
ACCORDING TO THE DAILY EXPRESS THE RETAILER SIR PHILIP GREEN HOPES HE WILL RECEIVE A FAIR HEARING WHEN HE'S QUESTIONED BY M.P.S ABOUT THE DEMISE OF B.H.S. THE MALE PRINCE A LIST OF THE TEN QUESTIONS WHICH IT BELIEVES HE MUST ANSWER THE LAST IS DOES YOUR CONDUCT BEFIT A KNIGHT OF THE REALM THE TYCOON WHO RECOMMENDED HIM FOR A KNIGHTHOOD SIR JOHN COLLINS TELL THAT TELLS THE MIRROR THAT HE WOULDN'T DO SO NOW THE PAPER ACCUSER SIR PHILIP OF MAKING HIS FORTUNE ON THE BACKS OF BRITISH WORKERS AND SAYS HIS REPUTATION IS IN FREEFALL
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE TWO SIDES OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE HAVE SET OUT THEIR VISIONS OF A POST BRICKS IT TO BRITAIN REMAIN PREDICTS TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS VOTE LEAVE PLANS LEGISLATION TO END Y. YOU INFLUENCE OVER IMMIGRATION TRADE AND THE COURTS
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN THEY WERE THE COMMENTS THAT LED TO HIM BEING SUSPENDED FROM THE LABOUR PARTY BUT WHEN THE FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON KEN LIVINGSTONE APPEARED IN FRONT OF EM PEAS YESTERDAY HE REFUSED TO APOLOGISE FOR HIS REMARKS ON HITLER AND ZIONISM HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
BACK IN APRIL THE FORMER LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON KEN LIVINGSTONE CREATED A FURORE WHEN HE SAID IN A RADIO INTERVIEW THAT HITLER HAD SUPPORTED ZIONISM IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES BECAUSE HE WANTED ALL JEWS TO LEAVE GERMANY HE WAS CONFRONTED IN PUBLIC BY LABOUR COLLEAGUE WHO DENOUNCED HIM AS ANTI SEMITIC HE WAS SUSPENDED FROM THE LABOUR PARTY WHICH HAS COMMISSIONED AN INQUIRY INTO ANTI SCIMITARS ARE MINUTES RANKS SO M.P.S ON THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WONDERED IF YOU WERE SORRY
ANYONE WHO'S BEEN UPSET BY WHAT I SAY I AM SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID IS TRUE AND
LITERALLY HITLER SUPPORTED SIGN IT'S NESSIE ONE SENTENCE WELL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN UPSET BY WHAT HE SAID THE M.P.S EARLIER QUESTION JONATHAN ARCAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DEPUTIES OF BRITISH JEWS THE LABOUR CHAIR KEITH VAZ ASKED YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THOSE ARE ANTI SEMITIC REMARKS I'M ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO OFFEND AND THEY WERE ANTI SEMITIC
BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT HE INTENDED ABOUT WHICH THERE MIGHT BE SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID IN TRYING TO SAVE THAT JEWS WERE LIKE
NOT ZIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS PLAINLY ANTI SEMITIC AND I JUST FIND IT ASTONISHING WE COULD HAVE MADE THOSE REMARKS AND STILL STAND BY
KEN LIVINGSTONE HAD BEEN SITTING LISTENING TO THAT CLOSELY FROM THE PUBLIC AREA JUST A FEW FEET AWAY TAPPING HIS FINGERS ON HIS KNEES WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN HE TOLD M.P.S HE WISHED HE COULD TAKE BACK WHAT HE'D SAID BUT NOT BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND AVOID REFERRING TO HIT GRAND ZIONISM IN THERE VANESSA FELTZ IN WHO I WOULD BECAUSE IT'S IT
IT'S YOU SORRY WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT WOULDN'T IT WE MADE IT BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ALL THE ANTI JEREMY AND PEOPLE IN THE LABOUR PARTY TO START WHIPPING UP THIS IS AN EVEN BIGGER ISSUE
ONE WAY WITNESSES SOMETIMES SURVIVE A DRESSING DOWN IN FRONT OF A COMMONS COMMITTEE IS TO AGREE WITH THE M.P.S AND EXPRESS MUCH SADNESS AND REGRET AT THEIR PAST BEHAVIOUR BUT AS THE CONSERVATIVE JAMES BERRY DISCOVERED THAT'S NOT KEN LIVINGSTONE'S WAY YOU'RE PERSISTENT HER ABSOLUTE REFUSAL TO APOLOGISED FOR OFFENCE YOU CAUSED TO JEWISH PEOPLE
COMPOUNDS THE INITIAL OFFENCE THAT YOU CAUSED BY YOUR COMMENTS WELL LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS
I COULDN'T MOVE THIS LAST FEW MONTHS I CAN'T GET DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT PEOPLE STOPPING ME AND SAYING WE KNOW WHAT YOU SAID IS TRUE DON'T GIVE IN
HORSE A LOT OF JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE OFFENDED
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TOLD A LIE THEY'VE BEEN TOLD I WAS A NAZI PUBLISHES APPALS ME SIR AND LABOUR M.P.S USE THIS IF YOU DELIBERATELY LIED ABOUT WHAT I'D SAID AND SMEAR MAYBE WISH TO UNDERMINE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND I MEAN THEY SHOULD BE THE ONES BEING SUSPENDED
LABOUR IS CHOKER MINA SAID AS A LONDONER HE'D CAMPAIGNED FOR KEN LIVINGSTON HE AGREED HE'D DONE A GOOD JOB ON HOUSING ON INEQUALITY BUT BY NEED TO SLEEP
AND REPEATEDLY OFFENDED JEWISH PEOPLE IN THIS WAY YOU'VE NOT ONLY BETRAYED OUR LABOUR VALUES BUT YOU BETRAYED YOUR LEGACY AS MAYOR BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE NOW GOING TO BE
HE'S BECOMING A PIN UP FOR THE KIND OF PREJUDICE THAT OUR PARTY WAS BUILT TO FIGHT
THAT IS A HUGE SHAME IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT KEN LIVINGSTONE ARGUED THAT HE HAD OFTEN BEEN REVILED IN THE PAST FOR HIS BELIEFS FOR STANDING UP FOR GAY RIGHTS OR FOR ADVOCATING DIALOGUE WITH THE I.R.A. AND ONCE AGAIN HE INSISTED THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN STIRRED UP BY M.P.S WHO OPPOSED JEREMY CORBIN AND THE LEFT WING OF THE PARTY
WHAT CAUSED OFFENCE WAS A GROUP OF BEEN BIT ALL PLAY OUT IN HE'S RUNNING ROUND LYING ABOUT WHAT I SAY YES
YES I WAS NO GOOD YOU WRIGGLING AWAY TOOK OVER DESCRIBING ROSS YOU POLISH THIS IS A LOT
AND I COULD HAVE SUED HIM I'M JUST NOT THE WASTE MY TIME AS FOR HIS ARGUMENT WELL NO ONE HAD REFUTED IT ANYONE CAN PROVE MY CITIZEN JOHN TAKE THAT TO THE BEST DINNER OF THEIR LIVES ODDLY ENOUGH NO ONE'S COME UP THIS WHAT ANY OF YOU DEMONSTRATE WHAT I SAID ISN'T TRUE
THAT'S THE FACT OF THE MATTER I CAME INTO POLITICS OR TELL THE TRUTH IT MAY BE THAT NOBODY ACTUALLY WANTS TO HAVE DINNER
NOT ONLY REJECTING HER SUPPER DATE KEITH VAZ SAID MISTER LIVINGSTONE HAD BEEN UNCONVINCING BUT KEN LIVINGSTON STILL INSISTED HE HAD ONLY TOLD THE TRUTH ADDING I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO POLITICS
SUSAN HERE REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED YES IN PARLIAMENT HALF PAST EIGHT AS USUAL ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEPARATE TODAY'S CLAIMS FROM THE RIVAL SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WILL INVOLVE THE CHANCELLOR AND HIS PREDECESSOR ALISTAIR DARLING WARNING OF ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT OF BRICKS IT AND THE LEAVES SIDE OUTLINING THE IMMEDIATE STEPS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN IF THAT IS THE RESULT
BUT HOW MUCH OF THE VOTERS LISTENING A CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IS IN NANTWICH IN CHESHIRE THIS MORNING WHAT ARE YOU FINDING ROSS ABOUT HOW MUCH THE MESSAGES ARE CUTTING THROUGH
THE MID MORNING BIRDSONG HERE THE TERRIFYING THOUGHT FOR POLITICIANS IS THEY CAN'T KNOW HOW MUCH ATTENTION VOTERS ARE ACTUALLY PAYING TO THE CLAIMS LIKE WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING AND WHAT IF THE PUBLIC AFTER WEEKS OF THIS NOW HAS DECIDED THEY WON'T HAVE THEIR MINDS CHANGED ALL MADE UP FOR THEM WHAT IF THEY'VE SIMPLY HEARD SO MUCH THAT THEY'VE STOPPED LISTENING TO HEART TO WHAT THOSE POLITICIANS HAVE TO SAY
WITH ITS LOAN BUSKER TUDOR TIMBER BEAMS AND UNION FLAGS NANTWICH DOESN'T FEEL WRACKED BY REFERENDUM ANGST BUT THERE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS STILL TO BE MADE
I'M EIGHTY ONE SO I HAVEN'T GOT LONG TO GO
SO I DON'T KNOW REALLY KNOW WHY I SHOULD BE TOO BOTHERED ABOUT IT BUT I AM
I AM BOTHERED ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY JUST A GENERAL WAY OF LIFE IS CHANGING
RON GILCHRIST THERE HE SOUNDS SOLD ON LEAVING BUT HE INSISTS THE RIGHT ARGUMENTS COULD YET SHIFT HIS VOTE SO THE OBVIOUS QUESTION HAS ANYTHING A POLITICIAN OR SAID IN THIS CAMPAIGN CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ALL UNFORTUNATELY NO
AND A LITTLE INDECISION MEANS GOOD TRADE FOR SOME WE DON'T NORMALLY SELL A LOT OF POLITICAL BOOKS IN THE BOOKSHOP AT THE SWAN HAS HAS PROVED TO BE VERY POPULAR
BOOKSHOP OWNER STEVE LAWSON UNDECIDED VOTER HAS RUN OUT OF COPIES OF THE GUIDE TO THE REFERENDUM ISSUES AUTHORS EXPERTS ARE ALL GETTING A HEARING HERE ANY ONE BUT THOSE WHO'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ELECTED
WITH POLITICIANS YOU WONDER DO THEY HAVE A SEPARATE AGENDA TO IT YOU KNOW YOU LOOK TO MAYBE LEADING BUSINESS PEOPLE LEADING ECONOMISTS OTHER SORT OF PUBLIC FIGURES MAYBE TO DIRECT
ALL VERY WELL BUT WHY WOULD YOU GO SURVEY SHARE WITH THIS PROGRAMME SUGGEST INDIVIDUAL POLITICIANS CAMERON CORBIN FAHRT ARGE JOHNSON HAVE HEFTY NEGATIVE TRUST RATINGS SO TWO TWO CELEBRITIES WHO VOICED A VIEW LIKE JEREMY CLARKSON OR MICHAEL CAINE AND CRUCIALLY ALSO GROUPS OF EXPERTS LIKE
BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ECONOMISTS ONLY ACADEMICS IN THE PERSONAL FINANCE JOURNALIST MARTIN LEWIS EMERGED WITH A POSITIVE SCORE IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE TRUST NO ONE'S VIEW BUT OUR OWN
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY LIKELY REMAIN VOTE A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD JESS GREEN CLEARING UP IN THE SHOP PREFERS FACTS NOT DELIVERED BY PERSONALITIES BUT SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR ME IT'S ALL TOO POLITICAL WHEN YOU SEE JUST PURE
ACTUAL THINGS WITHOUT ANY POLITICIANS ANY POLITICS NECESSARILY INVOLVED IT'S JUST NICE TO KNOW
OR THE BIT UNFAIR THIS ON POLITICIANS WELL PERHAPS THEY OFTEN SCHOOL NEGATIVELY ON TRUST AND WE WILL TEND TO INSIST WE ARE RIGOUROUS INDEPENDENT THINKERS FORMING OUR OWN CONCLUSIONS BUT WHEN THE BOOKSHOP CLOSED I WENT UP THE ROAD TO A NOISY SNOOKER ROOM IN CREWE WHERE I FOUND JUSTIFIED OR NOT
PORTION ABOUT POLITICIANS IN THIS REFERENDUM TURNED INTO SOMETHING MUCH MORE BIKE OUTRIGHT CONTEMPT
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO GO ON I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE SWAYED BY POLITICIANS SOME OF THE STUFF THEY COME OUT WITH THIS RIDICULOUS
I TRY NOT TO LISTEN TO HIM TO BE HONEST THEY WILL LIE IN THE VAGUE THEY NEVER ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IS TO WATCH QUESTION TIME CRACK QUITE REGULAR BOSTOCK WATCHING UP BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO SMASH THE TALLY
THAT REPORT FROM ROSS HAWKINS AND THOSE VOTERS WILL BE LISTENING WITH HIM TO GEORGE OSBORNE LIVE AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK AND WILL BE GETTING THEIR VERDICT ON WHAT THEY'VE HEARD FROM THE CHANCELLOR THEN
IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT COULD STRUGGLE TO FIND ENOUGH STAFF TO FULFIL ITS PLEDGE TO PROVIDE THIRTY HOURS OF CHILD CARE TO WORKING FAMILIES BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO SAY M.P.S ON THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE THEY SAY THE SUMS JUST DON'T ADD UP THE LABOUR M.P. MEG HILLIER CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE AND HE'S HERE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THAT'S FIFTEEN HOURS AT THE MOMENT THIS WAS A PROMISE TO EXTEND IT TO THIRTY BASICALLY TO ALLOW MORE WOMEN TO GET INTO INTO WORK WHAT'S
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING IS WRONG WITH IT IT'S AN APPEALING POLICY AS A WORKING MUM MYSELF OUT MY TONGUE A BIT OLD NOW AND BUT IT'S A GREAT POLICY BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PLACES TO FILL THAT MONEY WE HEARD VERY CLEARLY WAS A LOT OF PROVIDERS RELY ON PARENTS TOPPING UP THEIR FIFTEEN HOURS BY PAYING AT A HIGHER RATE AND THAT'S HOW THEY SURVIVE SO THERE'S NOT ENOUGH NECESSARY ENOUGH PLACES I'M NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS WHO ARE AND WE CAN ABSOLUTELY BE SURE AT THIS POINT WILL BE WILLING TO TAKE IT UP AT THE RATE
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT FUND IT SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE FIFTEEN HOURS THAT'S CURRENTLY BOAT ONLY WORKS BECAUSE IT'S SUBSIDISED BY PEOPLE PAYING FOR MORE ABSOLUTELY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE GOVERNMENT PUTS TOWARDS EACH PLACE ISN'T ENOUGH PROVIDERS TOLD US TO COVER THEIR COSTS PARTICULARLY WITH INCREASED WAGING COSTS BECAUSE OF MY QUALIFICATIONS WHICH AS WORKING PARENTS WANT QUALITY CHILDCARE THAT'S A GOOD THING TOO BUT THESE ARE PRESSURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T FACTORED IN
THEIR MATHS AND THEY'RE PILOTING IT IN SEPTEMBER BUT THAT'S VERY EARLY VERY LATE IN THE DAY WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND THE SPACE TO BE INTRODUCING IT THE FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER SO IT'S ALL A BIT OF A RUSH AND THEY'VE GOT A BIG TASK BUT IN THAT PILOT THEY HAVE SORTED OUT THEY'VE AGREED AN HOURLY RATE WINDOWS NURSERIES IN THE POND AREAS WHO HAVE
CLEARLY BEEN SATISFIED BY THAT SO WHY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE EXTENDED IF IT CAN WORK IN THE PILOT WELL IT DEPENDS EXACTLY WHETHER OTHER PROVIDERS WILL AGREE TO TAKE IT UP COS THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY WILL TAKE THE THUNDER PLACES BY GOVERNMENT MANY IF YOU WERE BASS IF YOU'RE PROVIDING YOU WITH A PARENT WING TO PAY TOP WHACK YOU MIGHT PREFER TO TAKE THEM OVER THE FREE PLACES IF YOU DON'T OFFER THEIR FREE PLACES YOU DON'T KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT AND SO THAT'S A REAL CONCERN GOT IF THE PROVIDERS I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THIS
THEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS A REAL STICKY PROBLEM COME SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT THEIR DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS REPORTER SAID WE'RE COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING HARDWORKING FAMILIES NOTHING SHOWS IS BETTER THAN THIS OFFER WE SEE WE'VE SEEN HUGE DEMAND FROM LOCAL AREAS TO TAKE PART IN DELIVERING THAT OFFER A YEAR EARLY WELL THAT'S GREAT IF THAT'S HAPPENED THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIGURES NINETY NINE PER CENT OF FOUR YEAR OLDS FREE ENTITLEMENT SO FAR ON THE CURRENT FIFTEEN HOURS HAS BEEN TAKEN UP LIKE LAMPS AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE IN THAT
NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THREE YEAR OLDS IF YOU GAV THAT DEMAND ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE CHILDCARE OUT THERE AND THE PROVIDERS ARE GOING AFTER WINNING TO DO IT SO IT'S ABOUT VOLUME BUT ALSO ABOUT WHETHER ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE THE PRICE JUST BRIEFLY YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE PEOPLE WILL LOSE OUT WHO WILL LOSE OUT IF AND WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK WILL BE THOSE WHO ARE POROUS ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALREADY HERE WE HAD EVIDENCE AND THAT AND THE MOMENT THAT LOT OF PARENTS ARE ASKED AND THAT'S WHEN YOU PAY THE EXTRA FOR ALL FOR THE TOP UP HOURS THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN BUT IT DOES AND THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAPPEN MORE
MEG HILLIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AT PHILIP AVERY'S JOINED US FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST THOUGH MORNING VERY GOOD MORNING TO SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND ALREADY FOR SOME OF YOU YOU HAVE THE MEASURE OF THE DAY IT'S BEEN TORRENTIAL ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTH WEST THERE ARE THUNDERSTORMS ALREADY ACROSS PARTS OF WALES THESE WILL BECOME EVER MORE PREVALENT ACROSS THIS PARTICULAR SWATHE OF THE COUNTRY AS TIME GOES ON TODAY ESPECIALLY SO INTO THE AFTERNOON
HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT ONE OR TWO FAVOURED AREAS WE'LL JUST SEE SOME SUNSHINE YOU'LL MISS THE VERY WORST OF THE CONDITIONS BUT AT THEIR WORST WELL THERE WILL BE SOME ISSUES WITH FLOODING I'M SURE ON THE ROADS AS THE DRAINS JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE INUNDATION TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT THE MID UPPER TEENS OR SO I'VE LEFT AT THE SOUTH EASTERN AREA OF ENGLAND NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMPLETELY DRY THROUGHOUT THE DAY O.K. AND MANY OF YOU HERE
WE'LL SEE SOME SUNSHINE BUT THERE IS STILL THAT POTENTIAL OF ONE OR TWO HEAVY DOWNPOURS BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE THE FREQUENCY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE FOR THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AGAIN MURKY FARE HERE THE CLOUD SITTING VERY LOW IN THE ATMOSPHERE HILL FOG BITS AND PIECES OF DRIZZLE WESTERN SIDE OF THE PENNINES PERHAPS SOMEWHAT CHEERIER PROSPECT AT THE SUNSHINE AND AGAIN ONE OR TWO SHOWERS HERE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND I THINK THINGS GRADUALLY IMPROVING THROUGH THE DAY AFTER A FAIRLY DULL START BITS AND PIECES AROUND THE AFTERNOON BRIGHTER DRIER SUNSHINE
TEMPERATURE OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN DEGREES AND FINALLY TO SCOTLAND OH DEAR SOUTHWESTERN SCOTLAND SUNSHINE AS A PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON THE EAST AND THE NORTH FOR THE MOST PART IT'S DULL WET AND WINDY IN MANY AREAS OF THE NORTHERN ARE STILL JUST POKING OUT IN SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE PALATABLE THE HIGH HERE OF EIGHTY
THANKS VERY MUCH NOW IF YOU WANT MORE GUIDANCE AROUND THE E.U. REFERENDUM TRYING TO SORT OUT FACTS THERE'S HELP ON LINE

UNCOVER THE FACTS BEHIND THE CLAIMANTS WITH B.B.C. REALITY
HELPING YOU MAKE SENSE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM SEARCH ONLINE AT B.B.C. REALITY
IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THIS PROGRAMME COMMUTING HELL HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH FOR RAIL PASSENGERS FACING REGULAR DELAYS AND WHAT SHOULD M.P.S ASKED THE FORMER BOSS OF B.H.S. SIR PHILIP GREEN WHEN HE APPEARS BEFORE THEM TODAY WILL BE HEARING FROM THE SHOP WORKERS UNION YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THE CHANCELLOR SAYS IT BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET WITH TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS ROLLS ROYCE'S WANTED A VOTERS SOAP FOR BRECK'S IT IT WILL RECONSIDER PLANS TO BUILD A NEW ENGINE TESTING PLANTS IN THE U.K.
THEY BROADCASTER AND POLITICIAN SIR CLEMENT FREUD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ABUSING GIRLS
THE NEWS IS READ BY CORI CORFIELD WE JUST EIGHT DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE TWO SIDES OF THE DEBATE ARE PUTTING FORWARD VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF BRITAIN BOATS TO END ITS MEMBERSHIP FOR REMAINING IN THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE BUT WARNED THAT AFTER BRECK SEARCH THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET WHICH COULD SLASH PUBLIC SPENDING AND INCREASE THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX BY TWO PENCE IN THE POUND
MISTER OSBORNE AND HIS LABOUR PREDECESSOR ALISTAIR DARLING OF SETTING OUT CUTS TO THE N.H.S. EDUCATION AND DEFENCE SPENDING WHICH THEY SAY MIGHT HAVE TO BE MADE TO PLUCK A BLACK HOLE IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT BEN RIGHT
THIS IS A STARK RAMPING UP OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CORE REFERENDA MESSAGE DON'T RISK IT GEORGE OSBORNE WILL SAY LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD BE A LOSE LOSE FOR BRITISH FAMILIES TRIGGERING A RECESSION THAT WOULD REQUIRE SPENDING CUTS AND TAX RISES WORTH THIRTY BILLION POUNDS TO REPAIR THE PUBLIC FINANCES DURING THIS PARLIAMENT THE FIGURE COMES FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES FORECAST OF THE LIKELY ECONOMIC IMPACT OF A BRECK'S IT
MISTER OSBORNE AND THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING WILL SAY SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND THE ARMED FORCES COULD SEE THEIR SPENDING CUT THE BASIC RATE OF INCOME TAX MIGHT HAVE TO RISE BY TEN PER CENT THE TOP RATE BY THREE PENCE THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS STRAINING TO CONVINCE VOTERS THERE WILL BE NO FINANCIAL WINDFALL FROM LEAVING THE E.U. ONLY SERIOUS ECONOMIC PAIN
BUT VOTE LEAVE ACCUSED THEIR OPPONENTS OF PANICKING AND SAID VOTERS WOULD NOT BELIEVE THESE HYSTERICAL PROPHECIES OF DOOM WITH A SMALL MAJORITY THE GOVERNMENT MAY STRUGGLE TO GET SUCH A BUDGET PASSED AND LABOUR SOURCES SAY THE PARTY WOULD NOT SUPPORT ANY FURTHER AUSTERITY
ONE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE SOURCE TOLD THE B. B. C. IT WAS A LAUGHABLE IDEA GEORGE OSBORNE WOULD STILL BE CHANCELLOR AFTER A VOTE TO LEAVE
THE BOAT LEAVE GREW SET OUT WHAT IT THINKS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO IF IT WINDS THE CAMPAIGN HIT TWIT TO AIM TO SETTLE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE E. BY TWENTY TWENTY AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO END THE ROLE OF E.U. JUDGES IN BRITISH LAW AND TO ABOLISH V.A.T. ON HOUSEHOLD ENERGY BILLS HE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
IN AN EFFORT TO QUASH CLAIMS BRECHT'S IT WOULD LEAD TO A LEAP IN THE DARK THE LEAF CAMPAIGN ARE SET OUT A TIMETABLE AND LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR BREAKING WITH THE E.U. THEY INSIST THE PROCESS WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE TWO YEARS ENVISAGED BY THE E.U. A TIME TIMEFRAME CRITICS CLAIM WOULD GIVE THEM A CRUCIAL ADVANTAGE IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS INSTEAD THE LEE SIDE SAY THEY WOULD AIM TO COMPLETE THE U.K.'S WITHDRAWAL BY THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION
PROCESS WOULD BEGIN WITH THE PULLING TOGETHER OF A CROSS PARTY NEGOTIATING TEAM PARLIAMENT WOULD THEN APPROVE A SERIES OF BILL'S AMONG THEM MEASURES TO HOLT AUTOMATIC ACCESS TO THE U.K. FOR E.U. CITIZENS AND AN END TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE EUROPEAN COURT AND THEY PREDICT THEY COULD ALSO CONCLUDE A NEW TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY
REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DISMISSED THE PLANS AS WILDLY OPTIMISTIC THEY ALSO POINT OUT THE BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGN ARE NOT IN POWER EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BEGINNING TO SOUND INCREASINGLY LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE BRECHT'S ITS GOVERNMENT IN WAITING
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST NAME MANUFACTURERS ROLLS ROYCE THAT IT WOULD RECONSIDER IT'S PLANNED INVESTMENT IN A NEW SIXTY FIVE MILLION POUND ENGINE TESTING FACILITY IN THE U.K. IF VOTERS OPTED FOR BRICK SET THE COMPANY WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ONE POUND IN EVERY FIFTIETH BRITISH EXPORTS HAS WRITTEN TO ALL ITS EMPLOYEES SING IT WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ROLLS ROYCE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT WARREN EAST SAYS LEAVING WOULD LIMIT ANY COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE
WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHERE TO PLACE DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR OPERATION WAY TO PLACE BUSINESS LIKE THAT AND UNST

THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S BEEN A WARNING ON BRECK'S IT FROM ROLLS ROYCE THIS MORNING AND DOMINIC HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE WARREN EAST DOMINIC YES HIM ASIDE FROM BRICKS AT ROLLS ROYCE HAS HAD A TORRID TIME IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH FIVE PROFIT WARNINGS AND HAVING TO SEE THE SHARE PRICE HALVED I ASKED WARREN IS WHAT HE WAS DOING TO TURN THE COMPANY ROUND
OUR TECHNOLOGY WINGS SO IN A COMPETITIVE HEAD TO HEAD
THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE WIN THAT'S A GREAT PLATFORM BUT WE HAVE SOME OF OUR FACILITIES THAT THAT NEED MODERNISATION AND SOME OF OUR PROCESSES PRACTICES AND BEHAVIOURS ALSO NEED MODERNISATION AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS THERE IS IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHEN YOU GO INTO A MODERN COMPANY
YOU WANT A COMPANY FULL OF DOERS NOT A COMPANY FULL OF COMMENT
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE CULTURE THEY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS OF RABBIT ROLLS ROYCE WAS SET ANOTHER ROLLS ROYCE CULTURAL PROBLEM DO YOU THINK
I DON'T THINK AS I WALKED INTO THE COMPANY NEARLY TWELVE MONTHS AGO I DON'T THINK THAT IS A PROBLEM WHICH
EXISTED THEN AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T EXIST TODAY WE WILL TOLERATE ABSOLUTELY NO IMPROPER BEHAVIOUR WHATSOEVER AND I THINK EVERY ONE OF OUR FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS EMPLOYEES IS IS WELL AWARE OF THAT AS WE SPEAK TODAY IT'S WELL KNOWN THIS AND S.F.O. INVESTIGATION GOING ON
HISTORICAL PRAXIS YOU'RE HAVING TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'RE ENGAGING QUITE A TOUGH COST CUTTING PROGRAMME YOU TAKE ABOUT A BILLION POUNDS OF COST OUT OF THE BUSINESS CAN YOU DO THE TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME
WE CAN CERTAINLY DID IT DO THE TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME TAKE COST OUT AND INCREASE PRODUCTION IN FACT I'D SAY THESE TWO THINGS ARE LINKED AND AT THE MOMENT OUR PLAN IS TO BE ABLE TO DOUBLE
PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF LARGE ENGINES LIKE THIS AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE THE PHYSICAL AREA
THAT WE'RE USING TO DO THAT BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING OURSELVES MORE EFFICIENT USING MORE MACHINES AND GENERALLY CREATING A MUCH MORE MODERN OPERATION
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THE LEVELS OF U.K. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT THE ROLLS ROYCE RECEIVES WE DO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FROM
GOVERNMENT OTHER GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR R. AND D. INVEST
POINT TWO BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL PER ANNUM COMES FROM GOVERNMENTS THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN GOOD PLAYING ITS PART
WHAT WE NEED FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSISTENCY DON'T NEED STOP START STOP START MEANS YOU CAN'T INVEST WITH CERTAINTY
CERTAINTIES WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP
IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF GOVERNMENTS THAT WOULD LIKE ROLLS ROYCE TO DO MORE IN THEIR BACK YARD AND ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY
WE DO GET GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN SINGAPORE GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
EUROPEAN FUNDS AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE SUPPORT FROM THE U.K. BECAUSE WHERE U.K. COMPANY
WITH A LOT OF JOBS HERE IN IN THE U.K. AND WE INTEND TO REMAIN A U.K. COMPANY AND A GREAT LEADER AT THE SAME TIME
THERE WAS WARREN IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ROLLS ROYCE AND A BREAKING STORY BERKELEY GROUP THE BIG LONDON HOUSE BUILDER THAT SPECIALISES IN UPMARKET PROPERTY IN THE CAPITAL THIS JUST TOLD THE STOCK MARKET THAT RESERVATIONS WERE DOWN TWENTY PER CENT IN THE FIVE MONTHS TO MAY IT'S BLAMING THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OUTCOME OF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM A SIGN PERHAPS THAT FINALLY THE LONDON HOUSING MARKET MIGHT BE RUNNING OUT OF STEAM

AND THERE WERE A LOT OF WORRIES ABOUT THE DO YOU OH OF COURSE AND HOW TO PREPARE FOR STEW REALLY IT WAS A LOT OF DEBATE AROUND
WHERE WE SHOULD CHEAP DEFEND ZONES ON HOW WE SECURE THE CITY CENTRES
ENTER A LOT OF MEASURES WE'RE TAKING A BED IT'S THERE'S NO WEIGHT SHOULD ENSURE AS YOU'RE A RISK OF COURSE AND I THINK PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THE THREAT FROM TERRORISM HOW SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE RESPONDING TO THAT
WE'VE WITH NANA OBVIOUSLY FRIENDS FIRST TIME INCH WHICH LINE THE RECENT THAT'D BEEN SHARKBAIT TERRORISM ARE SO WE'VE ALREADY PARIS
SEVERAL INTELLIGENCE GIRLS AND SO NOW IT'S NOT ABOUT PUTTING IN OR IT WON'T CHANGING AGAIN

DE BREADY COHESION OF THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL IT WAS VERY QUICK AND SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE FACE NOW IT'S REALLY BEING ABLE TO DETECT PEOPLE

THAT WAS KARIN THERE ASA GAV TALKING TO ME EARLIER THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER STRIKE ON SOUTHERN RAILWAY THIS MONTH IN A ROW OVER CHANGES TO THE ROLE OF ITS CONDUCTORS FROM AUGUST THEY'LL NO LONGER BE ON THE PLATFORMS TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE TRAIN DOORS BUT ACTORS ON BOARD SUPERVISES THE R.M.T. UNION SAYS THE GUARD'S CURRENT ROLE IS VITAL FOR SAFETY LAST NIGHT COMMUTERS GATHERED AT BRIGHTON STATION TO VOICE THEIR ANGER AT THE DISRUPTION
STRESSFUL I'M SIX MONTHS PREGNANT IT'S REALLY HARD SO
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS THEY'LL BE YOUR LEAVE WORK AND IT WILL TAKE THREE SOMETIMES
YOU'LL BE STRANDED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY HAYWARDS HEATH IS A PRIME LOCATION FOR TURFING YOU OFF THE TRAIN LEAVING
IT'S JUST APPALLING THAT'S JUST RUBBISH INNIT I'M GETTING I'M GETTING I'M HAVING DINNER DARREN'S GO STRAP EDUTAINMENT SOFA AT THE END OF THAT I DO
MY WORK'S SUFFERING I FEEL I LET PEOPLE DOWN THAT'S JUST BEEN ROTTEN I JUST WANT TO TRAIN I DON'T EVEN MIND STANDING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I JUST WANNA TRAIN THAT LEAVES LONDON AND GETS ME HOME IN AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES THAT'S
IT'S TAKEN ME AN AVERAGE OF THREE HOURS EVERY NIGHT LAST WEEK I THINK THE WORST THING ABOUT BEING COMMUTERS A FEW UTTERLY POWERLESS WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS
GRIT OUR TEETH AND GET ON THE TRAIN
WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY CHRIS FELT THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR CROYDON SOUTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHO IS AT FAULT FOR THE SITUATION I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF DUTY ARE THE FRANCHISE HOLDER OF SOUTHERN WHO HAVE BEEN DOING AN APPALLING JOB NOT JUST IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS BUT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THIS IS THE WHAT THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST PERFORMING RAILWAY NETWORK IN THE COUNTRY
AND IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE AND I THINK THEY SHOULD ACTUALLY LOSE THE FRANCHISE AND THIS FRANCHISE WHICH IS FAR TOO BIG IT COVERS TWENTY THREE PER CENT OF ALL U.K. RAIL JOURNEYS SHOULD BE BROKEN UP HOW WAS I GOING TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THESE COMMUTERS TAKING THREE TO FOUR HOURS TO GET HOME TO BRIGHTON FROM LONDON THE SERVICE HAS BEEN APPALLING I'VE HAD A CONSTITUENT IS ACTUALLY LOST THEIR JOB BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LATE SO PERSISTENTLY I'VE GOT CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE NOT SEEING THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY NEVER GET
HOME ON TIME JUST ON MONDAY OF THIS WEEK SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE TRAINS WERE EITHER CANCELLED OR OVER HALF AN HOUR LATE AND HOWARD WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR BREAKING UP THE FRANCHISE I THINK HE WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE YOU CAN TRANSFER THE METRO SERVICES INSIDE THE M. TWENTY FIVE TO TRANSPORT FOR LONDON WHO DO ARE VERY AND WITH THEY'D THAT'S HAPPENED ALREADY WITH WITH ANGLIAN RAILWAYS AND THEY DO LOOK EMPTY EIFFEL TRANSPORT FOR LONDON DO A GREAT JOB MANAGING THE LONDON OVERGROUND HAVING THIS UNWIELDY NETWORK THE COVERS A QUARTER OF ALL U.K. TRAIN JOURNEYS ARE SIMPLY TOO BIG AND G.T. R. I'VE DONE A TERRIBLE JOB
RUNNING IT BUT THE R. AND T. UNION ARE ALSO FELT THIS THESE STRIKE ACTION THEY'VE HELD ALREADY IN THERE'S ANOTHER STRIKE COMING IN ABOUT A WEEK'S TIME IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY THE CHANGES SET UNNECESSARY DID ALBERT THAT THE NETWORK THE SOUTHERN RAIL ARE BRINGING IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE WAY THAT THAT THE CONDUCTORS ARE USED AND WHAT THEY DO THEY WILL NO LONGER BE STANDING ON THE PLATFORM OPENING AND CLOSING THE DOORS WHICH IS
BASIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS YOU'D WANT SOMEONE TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR YOU IF I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR YOU BUT IF YOU WERE A BIT WORSE FOR WEAR TO GETTING ON THE TRAIN LATE AT NIGHT HEAVEN FORBID SIXTY PER CENT OF THE TRAINS ON THIS NETWORK ALREADY A DRIVER ONLY OPERATED IN THAT THEY WORK PERFECTLY SAFELY AND ALL THEY'RE DOING IS CHANGING THE ROLE SO THE DRIVER OPERATES THE DOORS
AND THE PERSON THAT'S CURRENTLY THE CONDUCTOR CONCENTRATES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TICKET COLLECTION AND THE DRIVER SITTING IN HIS CAB THAT'S BEEN UP THERE THAT'S CORRECT AND ABBEYS AND SIX TRAINS ALREADY NO ONE'S GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB NO ONE'S GOING TO GET PAID LESS MONEY NO TRAINS WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO PEOPLE WILL GO DOWN TO ONE PERSON SO FRANKIE DORON AND T. ARE AT FAULT FOR CALLING STRIKE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WORSE THAN THAT NOT ONLY ARE THEY HAVING OFFICIAL STRIKES THEY ALSO ORGANISE IN MY VIEW APPEARED TO BE ORGANISING SORT OF INFORMAL WILDCAT STRIKES BECAUSE THE SICKNESS AMONGST CONDUCTORS ON THE SERVICE
HAS GONE UP MASSIVE WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE DENIED WELL I MEAN THERE'S BEEN THE LEVEL OF CYGNUS HAS GONE UP BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF FIVE OVER THE PAST MONTHS OF STRESS OVER THERE THE CHANGES THAT THEIR EMPLOYER IS TRYING TO BRING IN MY JUST THE CHANGES ARE PRETTY MINOR SO I I HOPE BOTH RESPONSIBLE I THINK THEY'D THE FRANCHISE HOLDER SHOULD LOSE THE FRANCHISE BLOODING THE R. AND T. ARE BEING DEEPLY IRRESPONSIBLE AS WELL AND THE PEOPLE SUFFERING AND MY CONSTITUENTS OR USE THE
SERVICE EVERY DAY TO GET TO WORK WHOAH AS WE JUST HEARD FROM THE CLIP UNABLE TO GET TO WORK ON TIME AND NOT SEEING THEIR CHILDREN ANNIE MORNING ONE EXTREME CASE EVEN LOST THEIR JOB AS A RESULT OF THIS IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE IT'S GOT A FINISH CHRIS FELT AND P. THANK YOU

HOW GOOD A BRITISH HOME STORES THIS AND YOU GET CERTAIN STUFF THERE WITH US AT CHRISTMAS TIME WITH THEM IT'S EAST OF EXETER AND IT'S A VERY SAD TIME AND SHOULD BE ACTUALLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT WE WON'T KNOW TILL LATER OF COURSE HOW HOW HE'S GOING TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BUT HE MIGHT SAY LOOK HOW DIFFICULT THE RETAIL CLIMATE IS THE RISE OF THE OF THE LOW COST CHEAPER RETAILERS AND HOW MUCH THEY'VE SQUEEZED THE HIGH STREET IN GENERAL
I THINK YOU COULD SAY THAT I THINK WE COULD BE SAYING THE SAME FOR ALL RETAILERS I THINK THE MAIN THING WHAT PEOPLE FIND CONCERNING AS HE CAN JUST FELT HIS COMPANY FOR ONE POUND TO SOMEBODY'S BEEN BANKRUPT A NUMBER OF TIMES IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE EVEN TRIED TO SELL IT ON TO SOMEBODY CREDIBLE WHO COULD ACTUALLY TRY AND TURN THE BUSINESS ROUND I THINK READING BETWEEN THE LINES YOU SEEMS THAT HIS VIEW WAS JUST TRY AND GET RID OF IT QUICK AS POSSIBLE DO YOU STILL THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A BUYER SOMEONE IS GOING TO TAKE IT ON AND KEEP IT AFLOAT
I DO ACTUALLY STILL TAKE THAT VIEW AFTER I MEAN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE ADMINISTRATORS I DO KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL SOME CREDIBLE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT BUYING MAYBE NOT ALL THE BUSINESS BUT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT AND HOPEFULLY KEEP IN THE VAST MAJORITY IN JOBS AND KEEP IN THE BRITISH HOME STORE LOGO ON THE HIGH STREET WHICH ARE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE ASPECTS DO YOU THINK I THINK THE MOST ATTRACTIVE ASPECTS AFTER ME IS ACTUALLY KEEPING PEOPLE IN EMPLOYMENT
ABOUT HOW MANY I MEAN IN YOUR BEST CASE SCENARIO AM I WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY THAT BE THAT'S PROBABLY SAY TWO OR THREE RIGHT OUT OF ELEVEN THOUSAND YES
NO EMPLOYEE SORRY HOPEFULLY THERE LOOKING TO PROBABLY HALF THE STORE SO AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE HEAD COUNT WITHIN THE STORES ITSELF YOU MAY BE TALKING SIX THOUSAND HOPEFULLY
DAVE GILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIMON I MEAN DIP AT HEREFORD BUT THIS IS THIS IS THAT THE BALANCE ULTIMATE HAS TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN THE PRESENT IN THE PAST EMPLOYS AN END WEATHER THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS VERY ACRIMONIOUS PROCESS YOU'RE SORT OF HIGHLIGHTING THE PROBLEMS OF B.H.S. AND GIVING UP ON THE SEARCH FOR A BUYER I EXPECT THERE WILL BE BUYERS FOR SOME OF THE STORES I THINK PEOPLE COLLECT THE CAME CLOSE TO GET HER DOING SOME SORT OF DEAL BUT THERE'S NO POINT OF DOING IT WENT BEFORE IT WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION I EXPECT SOMEONE LIKE MIKE ASHLEY WILL
PROBABLY SHOW UP TO BUY PARCELS OF STORES AND WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IN THESE SITUATIONS OF THE WORKERS IN THOSE STORES ARE USUALLY TAKEN ON BY THE NEW TENANTS I THINK THE OTHER THING WE SHOULD SAY ABOUT THIS IS THIS
IN MANY WAYS THIS IS NOT A NEW STORY THIS IS A RETAIL BUST SOME STALLS ADAPT A OUT AND THRIVE AS THEY CHANGED TO THEIR CHANGING CUSTOMERS OTHERS DON'T AND THEY PERISHED BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS CASE BECAUSE THE PERSONNEL BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS WENT OUT IN THE GOOD
THE GOOD YEARS IN THE EARLY IS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR IT SHINES A LIGHT ON CAPITALISM IN THE MODERN AGE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT IN MOST OF THIS MONEY ENDED UP IN MONACO THEY'VE LIVED A VERY LAVISH LIFESTYLE THE GREENS SO THERE ARE SO MANY EXTRA DIMENSIONS TO THIS WHICH SHINE A LIGHT ON SO IT'S BEEN A REAL PRISON
THROUGH WHICH TO LOOK AT MODERN CAPITALISM THERE WERE LOTS OF BLUE CHIP ADVISERS YOU KNOW GRANT THORNTON ON SWING P.W.C. TO LAUNCH THESE ARE BLUE CHIP NAMES WERE ALL INVOLVED IN A TRANSACTION THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK HAD NO CHANCE OF OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS AND LOTS OF FISH LOTS OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT IF YOU LIKE THE FINANCIAL ESTABLISHMENT AS WELL AS THIS COLOURFUL TYCOON SIMON JACK AND DAVID GILL THANK YOU BOTH
IT'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND A CARTOON IN THE TIMES OFFERS A SOMEWHAT UNFLATTERING ASSESSMENT OF THE LABOUR LEADERS CONTRIBUTION TO THE REFERENDUM DEBATE A BEVY OF WELL KNOWN POLITICIANS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES ARE STRAINING EVERY MUSCLE AND SINEW IN A TUG OF WAR CONTEST AT THE BACK THE ROPE SLACKEN HIS HANDS STANDS JEREMY CORBIN DAILY MAIL THINKS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE SPEECH HE GAVE SURROUNDED BY HIS SENIOR COLLEAGUES WAS NOT WHAT HE SAID BUT THE IMAGE OF UNITY IT SUGGESTED
IF ONLY THEY'D BEEN ALLOWED TO WEAR TOGAS SAYS THE PAPIST SKETCH WRITER KEPT QUENTIN LETTS THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN US A RIVETING PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSASSINATION SCENE IN SHAKESPEARE'S JULIUS CAESAR A COUPLE OF GOD IN REPORTERS HAVE BEEN TO STOKE ON TRENT TO FIND OUT HOW MISTER CORBIN'S MESSAGE OF SUPPORT FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS GONE DOWN WITH LABOUR VOTERS IN A LABOUR SEAT THEY FOUND THAT ALMOST EVERYONE WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND OTHER GRIEVANCES THE SUN WHICH WANTS PEOPLE TO VOTE TO LEAVE IS SCATHING ABOUT LABOUR'S RECENT CONCERNS ABOUT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE
IT SAYS THE PARTY REVEALED ITS TRUE COLOURS WHEN IT'S SMEARED ITS OWN WORKING CLASS VOTERS AS RACES FOR OBJECTING TO THE HUGE INFLUX OF CHEAP LABOUR BUT THE DAILY MIRROR OFFERS ROBUST SUPPORT TO MISTER CORBIN THE TRADE UNIONS
AND THERE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAYING WALKING AWAY WOULD MEAN RECESSION LOST JOBS LOW INCOMES AND HIGHER PRICES THE DAILY STAR REPORTS THAT RUSSIAN HOOLIGANS CONTINUED TO ATTACK BRITISH FOOTBALL FANS IN LIL DESPITE THREATS TO EXPEL THE TEAM FROM THE TOURNAMENT THE F. T. SAYS THE SIGHT OF SUCH CRASHES IS DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIAR IT FEARS THAT A BELATED CAN DEP CONDEMNATION OF THE VIOLENCE BY THE KREMLIN WAS JUST PERFUNCTORY NOT A GENUINE CHANGE OF HEART EXPRESS HOPES THE DISPATCHING OF MORE BRITISH POLICE TO ASSIST WILL HELP CALM THE SITUATION
SIMON COW WRITING IN THE EYES HAS HE LIKE ANY OTHER FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS BEEN SWEPT ALONG BY TRIBAL PASSIONS ARE BIG MATCHES EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF BECOMING ABUSIVE BUT HE MAKES THE POINT THAT IN THE MAIN ENGLISH MAN'S KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE AND REMINDS HIS READERS THAT NOT ALL FIRMS ARE THUGS PICTURES IN THE DAILY MAIL RECALL THE IMPACT OF THE WORST DOWNPOUR FOR FORTY YEARS AT ASCOT OR SPLASH SKIRT AS THE SUN CALLS IT THE MIRROR SAYS THE DELUGE BROUGHT OUT BROLLIES AND CHIVALRY IN THE RAIN MIRACULOUSLY STOPPED WHEN THE QUEEN ARRIVED
YET MADE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTS OF THE WORLD WAS THE WORLD'S HOTTEST MONTH ON RECORD IN CASE OPTIMISM STARTS TAKING HOLD OF THE TIMES WARNS THAT BOOKIES HAVE STOPPED TAKING BETS ON DUNE BEING THE WETTEST ON RECORD A WORRY FOR ANYONE CONTEMPLATING WIMBLEDON AND GLASTONBURY
IN A LEADING ARTICLE THE TELEGRAPH POINTS OUT THAT THE PHRASE FLAMING JUNE WAS ONLY EVER THE TITLE OF VICTORIAN PAINTING NOT A DESCRIPTION OF THE WEATHER AND THE SUN TELLS A TALE OF A PENSIONER WHO SURVIVED BEING STRUCK BY A BOLT OF LIGHTNING AS HE WASHED UP AT THE WEEKEND HE'D BEEN HOLDING A CARVING KNIFE AND FORK AND WAS THROWN FIVE FEET ACROSS THE KITCHEN PARAMEDICS SAY BRIAN PHILLIPS HAS PROBABLY SAVED BY HIS RUBBER SOLED EMINA SLIPPERS THE HEADLINE IS MARKS AND SPARKS
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO IT RED TAPE WE ARE WRAPPED IN IT APPARENTLY HER LARGELY SOME ARGUE BECAUSE WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COVERS EVERYTHING FROM THE NUMBER OF FISH WE CAN CATCH TO HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH LEADS US TO THE NEXT IN A SERIES OF OBJECTS AND HOW OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AFFECTS THEM TIME TO TALK ABOUT CAR HERE'S MATTHEW PRICE
RIGHT SO THERE'S ONE ON THE SPARE TYRE
ANOTHER ONE ON THE WINDOW
THERE'S SEVERAL ALL OVER THE PLACE AS ONE OF THE WINDSCREEN WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE CAPITAL LETTER IT'S A SAFETY STANDARD BUT IT'S NOT AN E. YOU WON THE LETTER WHICH APPEARS ALL OVER OUR CARS IS A UNITED NATIONS MEASURE
I GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW UNLESS YOU'RE HEAVILY INTO THE MINUTIAE OF TRANSPORT POLICY THAT EASE SYMBOL COMES FROM AN INSTITUTION THAT I HADN'T HEARD OFF BEFORE I STARTED TO RESEARCH THIS OBJECT IT'S THE U. N. E. C. E. THE UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR EUROPE
IT'S SETS GLOBAL REGULATIONS FOR VEHICLES ON EVERYTHING FROM EMISSIONS TO FUEL CONSUMPTION AND SAFETY BRITAIN IS PART OF THE U. N. E. C. E. AND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRANSPORT HAS BEEN HEADING OFF TO SWITZERLAND WHERE ITS BASE TO HELP WRITE THE RULES WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS AND MOST OF THE REGULATIONS WHICH AFFECT THE CARS WE DRIVE IN HERE ARE YOU WIN RULES WHICH HAVE BEEN WRITTEN INTO U.K. LAW
RIGHT I'M JUST STRUGGLING TO
PUT THE CHILD SEAT IN HERE DADDY HARRY YEAH U.N. SYSTEM FOR INSTANCE CAME UP WITH THE RULES ON THESE THEY RECENTLY CHANGED THEIR SAFETY CRITERIA AND SO AS A RESULT OF THE U.K. AND THE E.U. BUT SOME E.U. COUNTRIES HAVE TOUGHER STANDARDS THAN THE MINIMUM SIT BY THE YEAR WHEN YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE PERFECTLY LEGAL IN THEIR SEAT WHEN DRIVING HERE
BUT HEAD TO ITALY OR FRANCE OR GERMANY WHERE THE STANDARDS ARE TIGHTER AND THEY MIGHT NOT BE
ONE RULE THAT BRUSSELS HAS IMPOSED TO CROSS THE BLOCK
IS THE NEED TO BELT UP WHEREVER YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE E.U. THAT'S YOU AND YOUR PASSENGER THERE YEAH BEING IN THE E.U. HASN'T MEANT WE HAVE TO DRIVE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD AS THEY DO ON THE REST OF THE CONTINENT NOR HAS IT MEANT THAT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT THE FRENCH MARSTON DRIVE AROUND WITH A BREATHALYSER KIT IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT
LED BY THE U.N. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS HAS SOUGHT TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION THAT OUR CARS MAKE THE E.U. SETS MEANT THREE EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS FOR NEW CARS THERE WERE PENALTIES FOR MANUFACTURERS WHO FAILED TO HIT THEIR TARGETS REWARDS FOR THOSE WHO MET THEM THE CURRENT E.U. EMISSIONS TESTING REGIME IS IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE
I AM THE CLEAN VEHICLES DIRECTOR FOR TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT IN BRUSSELS WE HAVE A SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT IN WHICH THE CAR INDUSTRY ACTUALLY PAYS FOR THE ORGANISATION'S UNDERTAKE THE TESTS THEY PAY THE NATIONAL REGULATORS WHO APPROVE THEIR VEHICLES FOR THEM IN SOME CASES LIKE GERMANY OR IN FRANCE THE REGULATORS ARE VERY WEAK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP THEIR NATIONAL COMPANIES
ONCE ONE REGULATOR HAS
VEHICLE THEN HAS AN E.U. WIDE CERTIFICATE FOR SALE NOW THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WANTS TO STRENGTHEN THIS SYSTEM WITH LESS CONTROL OVER TESTING GIVEN TO THE NATIONAL REGULATORS THE FRENCH AND GERMANS AND OTHERS ARE RESISTING THE U.K.
VERY OFTEN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THE FRENCH AND GERMAN POSITIONS
EXPECT A BIG DELAYS IN DRAWING UP THE NEW RULES ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BRUSSELS AND IN THIS CASE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WANTING CONTROL TO BE CENTRALISED WHILE MANY OF THE BIG E.U. COUNTRIES SIT IN THE SLOW LANE REFUSING TO GIVE
MATTHEW PRICE WITH THE LATEST IN A SERIES ON THE E. AND EVERY DAY OBJECTS AND TOMORROW WE'RE HAVING ANOTHER QUESTION DAY ACROSS B.B.C. NEWS A CHANCE TO SEND IN YOUR QUESTIONS ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH WE WILL PUT TO THE B.B.C.'S FINEST MINDS WHETHER ON EUROPE POLITICS BUSINESS ECONOMICS THE LAW SO IF YOU'RE STILL DECIDING HOW TO VOTE SEND YOUR QUESTION TO ASK BY EMAIL TODAY AT B.B.C. DOT CO DOT U.K.
ON TWITTER AT B. B. C. R. FOR TODAY ALL VIA A FACEBOOK PAGES AND WE WILL BE ANSWERING THEM ON TOMORROW'S PROGRAMME AT HOPPER STATE IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A OXER STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRISTCHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YESTERDAY MARKED ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FUNERAL OF HORATIO HERBERT KITCHENER LORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM
ON THE FIFTH OF AUGUST NINETEEN FOURTEEN THE DAY AFTER BRITAIN DECLARED WAR ON GERMANY KITCHENER WAS MADE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR HE WAS ALREADY A NATIONAL HERO A FIELD MARSHAL AND A FORMER COLONIAL ADMINISTRATOR HE REALISED AS FEW DID AT THE TIME THAT THERE WOULD BE NO EASY VICTORY AHEAD BUT A LONG AND GRUELLING CAMPAIGN
WHAT HE'S MOST FAMOUS FOR IS HIS IMAGE IT WAS HIS STERN FACE THAT STARED DOWN FROM RECRUITING POSTERS IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEMANDING YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU RECRUITMENT WAS ALREADY HIGH AND BY THE END OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR TWO AND A HALF MILLION MEN HAD SIGNED UP
MAKING THE LARGEST VOLUNTEER ARMY THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN THE IMAGE OF KITCHENER HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF AN ICON OF ADVERTISING IT'S BEEN IMITATED PARODIED AND OFTEN RIDICULED BUT IN ITS TIME THE POSTAL STRIKE A CHORD THIS WAS NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT CONVEYED AUTHORITY IN AN AGE WHEN THERE WAS MORE RESPECT FOR IT THAN THERE IS TODAY
THE GROOMED MOUSTACHE THE I'M SMILING GAVE THE POINTED FINGER SEEKING YOU OUT BUT THE FAMILIAR FACE ALSO GAVE THE POSTER OF PERSONAL QUALITY KITCHEN ARE PERSONIFIED THE COUNTRY NOT AS A NATION OF STRENGTH BUT AS A NATION IN NEED THERE'S THE SHADOW OF THE PREACHER IN HIS APPEAL THE POINTED FINGER RECALLING THE FINGER OF GOD AND GOD'S PLEASED TO EVERY HUMAN HEART TO RESPOND WITH FAITH AND COURAGE
KITCHENER TO NOT LIVE TO SEE THE FINAL VICTORY HE WAS DROWNED ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE NINETEEN SIXTEEN ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION TO RUSSIA
HIS SHIP H.M.S. HAMPSHIRE IT'S A GERMAN MINE AND SANK WITH ITS SIX HUNDRED MEN JUST OFF THE COAST OF ORKNEY
HIS FUNERAL AT SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL WAS A GREAT EVENT CORRESPONDENCE AT THE TIME DESCRIBED THE CONGREGATION AS A SOMBRE TWO TONE SEA OF BLACK FOR MOURNING SET OFF BY THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE MILITARY THE NATIONAL MOOD TOWARDS HIM AS ONE OF GRATITUDE THAT HE WAS A FLAWED HERO DIFFICULT AND ABRASIVE
BUT IT'S THE POSTER IMAGE OF KITCHENER THAT'S LIVED ON THE EFFECT OF HIS STARE IS PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE HAD A CAST IN ONE EYE AND HE REALLY DOES LOOK RIGHT THROUGH YOU BUT HE ALSO ASKED FOR HELP
WE ALL WANT TO BE NEEDED WE WANT TO FEEL WE'RE NOT JUST PASSIVE RECIPIENTS OF WHATEVER FATE HANDED DOWN TO US BUT ACTIVE AGENTS AND SHAPING THE FUTURE
REFLECTING ON THAT I WONDER WHAT A POSTER SAYING YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU WOULD EVOKE TODAY WHO WOULD MAKE THE APPEAL AND WHO WOULD RESPOND
IF THEY WERE TO BE SUCH AN APPEAL IT WOULD SURELY BE ASKING US TO UNITE TO SEARCH OUR SOULS FOR THE VALUES WE HOLD IN COMMON THE VALUES WHICH LEAD TO FREEDOM PEACE AND JUSTICE THERE ARE IMPORTANT DEBATES ABOUT HOW WE GET THERE BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS THE GOAL
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CANNON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT FRANCE'S PRIME MINISTER CALLED YESTERDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK A WATERSHED IN TERMS OF HORROR A COUPLE BOTH IN THE POLICE STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR HOME AND THE ATTACK POSTED LIVE ON FACEBOOK THE KILLER IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID OF THEIR THREE YEAR OLD SON WHO SAW THE WHOLE THING I DON'T YET KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH HIM
THAT YOUNG BOY WAS LATER RESCUED BY POLICE JEAN CHRISTOPH CUVEE IS WITH THE POLICE UNION UNITY S. G.P. AND HE JOINS US FROM PARIS AND WERE ALSO JOHN AT THE MIND BY A C. M. ELDER FRAU WHO IS EXPERT ON JARRED EASON ADVISES THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH HELLO GOOD MORNING FROM PARIS JEAN
JEAN CHRISTOPH GROOVY TWO DEAD IS NOT AS HIGH A DEATH TOLL AS MANY OTHER TERRORIST ATTACKS BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PERHAPS THE INTIMACY OF IT BEING IN THESE COUPLES HOME HOW HAVE THE POLICE BEEN AFFECTED BY
SO I DO FIRST SO VERY VERY SAD BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT IN FRANCE A POLICEMAN AND HIS WIFE HE'S CLEANED IN FRONT OF HIS YOU KNOW FOR US HOME IS
HE'S LIKE A SANCTUARY AND INVOLVED AND THEY'RE VERY VERY SELDOM
WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU HAVE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE HAD PUT THIS ON FACEBOOK AND WAS EFFECTIVELY BROADCASTING IT TO THE
YOU KNOW
ORGANISED A DEBAUCHED AND NOW HAD A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS ONE WAY AND IT'S EASY FOR FOR TERRORIST TO TO SPREAD THOUGHT
AND THEY SHOWED IN A MOVIE YOU KNOW THEY WEREN'T TOO TO HAVE SUMMONED AT THOSE ING FOR A CRIME
NOW I KNOW THE UNIONS MET THE POLICING MINISTER YESTERDAY WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT WHAT DID YOU ASK FOR IN DEALING WITH THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS SO WE WENT TO
KERRY OR ENDS WHEN AUF OTHO VACANCY
WE WENT TO TO TO BRING WIZ HER BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE TWENTY FOUNDER OF AN ODD CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY WHERE
HOW CAN I SAY THE THE DETAIN YOU WANT TO BE ARMED ALL THE TIME JUST DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ON DUTY AS YOU CAN I BRING YOU IN HERE HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THEY THE GOVERNMENT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS ATTACK PARTICULARLY GIVING THAT IT COMES ON THE HEELS OF OTHERS
I MEAN LIKE IT MUST BE A LONG TERM RESPONDS LIME AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO HORACE THAT'S THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WAS FOR MANY MANY YEARS VERY VERY HESITANT GEM PUTTING FOR EXAMPLE PREVENTION CENTRES AND PRESENCE INTO PLACE
MEANING UM LIKE THE SAME THING AS THE UNFORTUNATES ARE THE ATTACKS OR SHIRLEY HAVE DOOR LAST YEAR ENDS IN NOVEMBER ATTACKS AS YES THERE'S A CHEQUE AGAIN WAS A CONDEMNED CRIMINAL HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR CRIMINAL FANTASY JUST GOT VERY RECENTLY QUITE RECENTLY OUT OF PRISON THERE WAS NO FOLLOW UP ON HIM AT ALL
IN TERMS OF REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY AND SO WE HAVE LIKE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN OUR ONLY PRESENT FOR MANY MANY HOURS THEY'RE RELEASED AND I DO NOT WATCH CLOSELY ENOUGH LAND TO THEM SOMETIMES NOT HOW TO REINTEGRATE INTO SCIENCE I'VE BEEN SINCE THE FIRST I'M SURE IT'S VERY VIRUS I'M SO SORRY FORGIVE ME AND PLAYS FORGIVE ME FOR DRUNK SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IN ALL THESE CASES THESE WERE CRIMINALS WHO WERE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T REHABILITATED RADICALISED
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M SAYING I'D LIKE AND THE ONES YES LIKE CRIMINALS WHO WERE PETTY CRIMINALS AND BECAME RADICALISED EVEN WENT ALREADY INTO PRISON FOR A JIHADI FANTAS AND DOESN'T WERE FANS AS THEY GET OUT OF PRISON AND COMMIT HORRIBLE CRIME SO THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE SEWERS OF JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN THEN OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE SOME SOUL SEARCHING FINDING OUT WHY SO MANY OF THOSE ATTACKS HAPPEN IN FRANCE YOU KNOW
COMMITTED BY YOUNG MAN WHO HAS OFTEN COMMON ORIGINS MEANING ON THE TRAMS OF IMMIGRATION IN SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND LIVING ROOM FRENCH SUBURBS HAVING THE PAST LESS PETTY CRIMINALS OR SOMETIMES IN MORE VIOLENT CRIME SO I'M JUST ASKING LIKE IT MAJOR QUESTIONS WHICH FRENCH THE SIRENS FRAGILE GOVERNMENTS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WAS LIKE BUT THAT'S MAYBE TRUE FOR EUROPEAN SECURITY SERVICES EVEN THE AMERICANS YOU KNOW
A LOT OF TAX LIKE IT WILL LAND LAMBERT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN LAND BY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INTERROGATED I SECURITY SEARCHES MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE F.B.I. FRENCH SECURITY AS A STOOL COME IT'S KIND OF HORRENDOUS ACT SO OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE TOLD SEARCHING AND A BIG QUESTION IN TRAMS ARE FIRM HOW EFFICIENT AS POLICE WORK
WHY WHY THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR QUESTIONING MOTHER HAD NOT BEEN DETECTIVES AS POTENTIAL TERRORISTS SO THAT PERHAPS THEY HAVE IT'S JUST THAT THEY HAVE AND ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING AND THAT MAY BE PART OF THE PROBLEM
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S PART OF PROBLEMS OUT BUT IF YOU HAVE THOSE PEOPLE ON THE RADAR AND YOU NEED TO HAVE SALMON RUNS A RAIDER PROMINENTLY ON THE APPARENTLY SO MAYBE FRENCH ALL EUROPEAN POLICE SERVICE AS WELL AS AMERICANS NEED NEED TO HAVE SPECIALISED UNITS
AND MORE MANPOWER TO FOLLOW ARTIST PEOPLE YOU TRY JUST IN FRANCE AND ANOTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS SINCE LIKE WHICH IS NOT REALLY RELEVANT TO THE CASE I'LL FIRM
THE MURDERER OF THE FRENCH POLICEMAN THERE'S A LEG EACH LEG OF OUR SPEAKERS IT'S BECAUSE YOUR PIMPLY SERVICES JUST A FINAL BRIEF WORD FROM YOU JEAN CHRISTOPH CUVEE THE FRENCH POLICE ARE UNDER HUGE PRESSURE AT THE MOMENT YOU'VE GOT THE EUROS AND WE'VE SEEN THE VIOLENCE THERE WE'VE GOT RIOTS IN PARIS LAST NIGHT AS A RESULT OF THE LABOUR REFORMS AND THEN THIS ATTACK WHAT'S THE MOOD AMONG POLICEMEN

REFERENDUM THE TWO SIDES OF THE DEBATE ARE PUTTING FORWARD VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN BRITAIN BOATS TO END ITS MEMBERSHIP FOR REMAINING IN THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE AND SLEEP SLEEPER PREDECESSOR ALISTAIR DARLING OR WARM THAT AFTER BRECK SAID STAY THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET IN THIS PARLIAMENT WHICH COULD SLASH PUBLIC SPENDING AND INCREASED TAXES
HE BASED THAT ON INDEPENDENT FORECASTS FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES WHICH PREDICTED THIRTY BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES BUT FIFTY SEVEN TORY M.P.S IN FAVOUR OF BRICK SUIT SAY THEY WERE TRIED TO BLOCK ANY SUCH BUDGET HERE'S OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CAN SPARE
THE MOST DRASTIC WARNING YET IN A CAMPAIGN LACED WITH FEAR HAS MET A DRASTIC RESPONSE TO AT OSBORNE TOGETHER WITH THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING VOWS TODAY THAT THE HIT TO THE ECONOMY WOULD BE SO GREAT IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. THAT HE'D HOLD A BUDGET WITH CUTS AND TAX RISES
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BUT IN RETALIATION IN A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO MISTER OSBORNE'S AUTHORITY FIFTY SEVEN TORY M.P.S INCLUDING FORMER CABINET MINISTERS HAVE ISSUED A STATEMENT INCREDULOUS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S BEHAVIOUR SAYING IT'S ABSURD TO MAKE A POLITICAL PROMISE TO PUNISH HER VOTERS IN THIS WAY BREAK CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO PROMISES AND MOST SERIOUSLY FOR A GOVERNMENT WITH A TINY MAJORITY
THEY SAY THEY WOULD VOTE TO BLOCK SUCH A BUDGET MAKING MISTER OSBORNE'S POSITION UNTENABLE AS THE CHANCELLOR THREATENS DRASTIC ACTION SO TWO BY SUGGESTING AN OPEN COUP AGAINST HIM HIS INTERNAL OPPONENTS THREATEN HIM
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE A WEEK TOMORROW THE GOVERNING PARTY MAYBE CHANGED FOR GOOD
DON'T LEAVE GROUP HAS ALSO SET OUT WHAT IT THINKS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO IF IT WINS THE CAMPAIGN IT WOULD HELP TO SETTLE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
IN AN EFFORT TO QUASH CLAIMS BREAKS IT WOULD LEAD TO A LEAP IN THE DARK THE LEAF CAMPAIGN SET OUT A TIME TABLE AND LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR BREAKING WITH THE E.U. THEY INSIST THE PROCESS WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE TWO YEARS ENVISAGED BY THE E.U. A TIME FRAME CRITICS CLAIM WOULD GIVE THEM A CRUCIAL ADVANTAGE IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS INSTEAD THE LEE SIDE SAY THEY'D AIM TO COMPLETE THE U.K.'S WITHDRAWAL BY THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION
THE PROCESS WOULD BEGIN WITH THE PULLING TOGETHER OF A CROSS PARTY NEGOTIATING TEAM PARLIAMENT WITH THEN APPROVE A SERIES OF BILL'S AMONG THEM MEASURES TO HOLT THE AUTOMATIC ACCESS TO THE U.K. FOR E.U. CITIZENS AND AN END TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE EUROPEAN COURT AND THEY PREDICT THEY COULD ALSO CONCLUDE A NEW TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY
SOME IN THE E.U. YOU SUGGESTED IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS AND REMAIN SUPPORTERS THIS MORNING STRESS THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN WE'RE NOT IN POWER EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BEGINNING TO SOUND INCREASINGLY LIKE AN ALTERNATIVE BRECHT'S ITS GOVERNMENT IN WAITING
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN MANUFACTURERS ROLLS ROYCE HAS WARNED THAT IT WOULD RECONSIDER THAT'S PLANNED INVESTMENT IN A NEW SIXTY FIVE MILLION POUND ENGINE TESTING FACILITY IN THE U.K. IF VOTERS OPTED FOR BRICK SET THE COMPANY HAS WRITTEN TO ITS EMPLOYEES SAYING IT WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC O'DONNELL REPORTS
IN A LETTER TO WORK AS A ROLLS ROYCE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WARRANT EAST SAYS THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD LIMIT ANY COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PLAN AND BUDGET FOR THEIR FUTURE
ROLLS ROYCE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG INVESTMENT PROGRAMME TO DOUBLE ITS OUTPUT OF ENGINES BUT MISTER EAST IF BRITAIN LEAVES A EUROPEAN UNION INVESTMENT COULD BE PUT ON HOLD INCLUDING PLANS FOR A NEW SIXTY FIVE MILLION POUND ENGINE TEST FACILITY FOR EXIT RESULT WOULD LIKELY LEADS TO A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY
WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD WE'RE GOING TO BE HELD BACK BY UNCERTAINTY AND WE COULD DO WITHOUT THAT
MISTER EAST SAID BRICKS IT WOULD GIVE THE HERO IN JAMAICA'S BIG AMERICAN RIVALS G. IAN PRATT AND WHITNEY HE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THE COMPANY'S INTERVENTION ON THE BRICKS AT THE BAIT IS SIGNIFICANT AS WELL AS HAVING THE MOST FAMOUS NAME IN BRITISH MANUFACTURING IT ACCOUNTS FOR ONE POUND IN EVERY FIFTY HAVE BRITISH EXPORTS

IN TWENTY TWELVE DOUG POORLY TRIED TO GET ON A BUS IN WETHERBY BUT A MOTHER WITH A BUGGY REFUSED THE DRIVER'S REQUEST TO MOVE FROM THE WHEELCHAIR SPACE MY PAULY COULDN'T TRAVEL HE SUED THE BUS OPERATOR FIRST GROUP AND WON A JUDGEMENT THAT THEIR POLICY OF ASKING BUT NOT MAKING ABLE BODIED PEOPLE VACATE THE SPACE WAS UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION
THE COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED THAT RULING THERE WAS NO LEGAL DUTY TO MAKE PEOPLE MOVE NOW MISTER PAUL IS TAKING HIS CASE FUNDED BY THE EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND
CLIVE COLEMAN REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT AND INCREASE IN INCOME TAX INHERITANCE TAX FUEL AND ALCOHOL DUTY A CUT IN THEIR BUDGETS OF THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS AND DEFENCE ALL OF THAT IS WHAT THE CHANCELLOR SAYS COULD HAPPEN IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION NEXT WEEK APPEARING ALONGSIDE HIS LABOUR PREDECESSOR ALISTAIR DARLING GEORGE OSBORNE WILL SAY TODAY THAT BOTH SPENDING CUTS AND TAX RISES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FILL A THIRTY BILLION POUND HOLE IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES
HE ASSUMED HE'D BE IN OFFICE TO PUT THOSE INTO A POST FOR EXIT BUDGET THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM FIFTY SEVEN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAVE SAID THIS MORNING THEY WON'T HAVE IT HIS POSITION WOULD BE UNTENABLE AND GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S SMALL MAJORITY HE IGNORES THEIR THREAT AT HIS PERIL THE CHANCELLOR'S WITH A SOUND THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CAN WE FIRST BE CLEAR ON THE STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT IT IS A CAMPAIGN DOCUMENT FROM REMAIN NOTHING MORE
FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY YOU HAVE A CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR CHANCELLOR AGREEING ON THE SCALE OF DECISIONS NEEDED TO FIX THE PUBLIC FINANCES IF WE QUIT THE E.U. THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE INCREASES IN TANKS THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE CUTS IN PUBLIC SPENDING TO FILL THE BLACK HOLE AND WE'VE GOT THE MARKET'S WARNING US NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE QUIT YOU'VE GOT THE EXPERT'S SPELLING OUT THE CONSEQUENCES AND TODAY YOU'VE GOT A CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR CHANCELLOR
SPELLING OUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THE TAXES THEY PAY AND IT WOULD BE SELF IMPOSED AUSTERITY MANY YEARS TO COME THEY'LL BE JUST FOR THAT HAVE MADE MY POINT WITH FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAST RECESSION WHY WOULD WE WANT TO IMPOSE A RECESSION ON OURSELVES IN JUST OVER A WEEK'S TIME BUT WHEN YOU SAY THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN AND YOU YOU WRITE IN THE TIME STAY THERE WOULD BE A PERMANENT TO DETERIORATION IN PUBLIC FINANCES
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING ABOUT I MEAN NO COUNTRY HAS EVER LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION LET ALONE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT BRITAIN WOULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT SO HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT WOULD DEFINITELY HAPPEN FIRST FOR YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT OF EXPERT OPINION TOO GOT THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES SAYING THERE WOULD BE A TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION POUND
DETERIORATION IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH SAYS MORE THAN FORTY BILLION POUND DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC FINANCES SECOND ALL THE MODELS ARE BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST ME THEY USE ALL THAT KIND OF DATE AND THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS SCENARIO IN THURSO YOU'VE GOT ON THE WORLD'S LEADING INDEPENDENT THINK TANKS EXTERNAL BODIES AND YOU'VE GOT THE MARKET'S LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR
PROGRAMME IS TELLING LISTENERS TODAY YOU'VE GOT A ROLLS ROYCE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST COMPANIES ISSUING A WARNING TO ITS STAFF ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF QUITTING THE E.U. YOU'VE GOT ONE OF OUR LARGEST PROPERTY DEVELOPERS BERKELEY HOMES SAYING THAT THERE'S BEEN A SHARP FALL IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR NEW HOUSES AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF FEARS ABOUT THE Y. HE'S A REAL WORLD THINGS WERE ANNIE NOW AND AS FAR AS THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO TO BRITAIN ARE CONCERNED
ECONOMICALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE ALREADY WEREN'T DOING AS WELL AS WE WERE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WAS WEAKER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR COMPARED TO THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT SUITS YOU AT THIS MOMENT TO SAY THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE FEARS OF BRICKS IT BUT THIS WAS ALREADY A WEAK ECONOMY BEFORE ALL OF THIS BECAME A REAL PROSPECT ACTUALLY WITH ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES IN THE WEST AND WE HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN WORK
WE ARE GROWING LESS THAN WE WERE AT LAST IT WAS I DIDN'T THERE'S CLEARLY THERE WAS A PROBLEM AT THE START OF THIS YEAR THAT YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE COUNTRY FACES ALL SORTS OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES YES IT DOES LOOK ALL THESE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES FACE THIS CHALLENGE OF HOW YOU HAVE SUSTAINABLE UNPRODUCTIVE GROWTH IN THE COMING YEARS BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING
CUTTING OFF YOUR LINKS WITH YOUR CLOSEST TRADING ALLIES SELF IMPOSING ON YOURSELF A RECESSION IS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS AND IN THE END IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS SHOW WHO EITHER WORK OR RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESS
AND LOTS OF PEOPLE AND LOTS OF BUSINESSES ARE AT THE MOMENT DELAYING DECISIONS BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN BRITAIN QUIT EAR AND YOU EVEN HAVE THOSE TODAY WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. SAYING IT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS FOR YEARS AND EBBING OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FIXING THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS FOUR YEARS OF DELAYED ACTIVITY LESS
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S HOW THE COUNTRY FUNDS IT'S PUBLIC SERVICES THAT'S SO WE EITHER HAVE TO GET MORE MONEY IN BY RAISING TAXES LIKE INCOME TAX
ALL YOU HAVE TO SPEND LESS ON THE BIG PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE THE HEALTH SERVICE OR THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ALL THE DEFENCE BUDGET AND YOU ARE RAISING THINGS WHICH NOT ONLY DID YOU VOW IT YOU'RE IN YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO LAST YEAR THAT YOU WOULD NOT DUBAI BY TALKING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX YOU COULD BE BREAKING YOUR OWN TAX LOCK LEGISLATION WELL WHEN WE FOUGHT THE GENERAL ELECTION WE HAD AN ECONOMIC PLAN AND WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMIC PLAN
THAT IS DELIVERING THAT PROSPERITY IN THE JOBS IN THERE LIKE YOU HEARD ABOUT AND FOR A REFERENDUM ON THE WAY DON'T TRUST US TOGETHER THE POINT IS THE COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN
IF WE QUIT THE E.U. THERE WOULD BE WE'D WAKE UP AND JUST OVER A WEEK'S TIME WITH NO ECONOMIC PLAN FOR A COUNTRY WITH FINANCIAL INSTABILITY WITH YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO CUT YOUR CLOTH ACCORDINGLY THE COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD
THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT AND WE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE TAXES THAT IS THE REALITY OF A COUNTRY THAT IS NOT JUST IMMEDIATELY POORER BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THERE LIKE THAT FOR DECADES AHEAD WILL BE DOING LESS TRADE
WITH ITS KEY PARTNERS IT'S KEY ALLIES AND INDEED THE REST OF THE WORLD THERE'S A LOT OF OUR TRADE DEALS ACTUALLY DEPEND ON OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE THAT'S COMMON SENSE IF YOU'RE TRADING LESS IF THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE'S LESS MONEY COMING INTO THE EXCHEQUER AND THEREFORE THERE HAS TO BE LESS MONEY GOING OUT
THE PROBLEM WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING AND THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON THE ECONOMY IS THAT PERHAPS IT'S POSSIBLE VOTERS WON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ALL THEY MIGHT BE THINKING YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY THIS IS THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE BETTER OR WORSE OFF IT'S ABOUT THE KIND OF COUNTRY THEY WANT AN IMMIGRATION IS A BIG PART OF WHY SOME FEEL LIKE THIS
IS THERE ANYTHING FURTHER THAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER IN TERMS OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
WITH IT LIVING JUST A MOMENT BUT LET ME DRESS THIS POINT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WEALTHY TO SAY WHY I DON'T MIND WE'LL HAVE A RECESSION FOR A FEW YEARS I DON'T MIND HAVE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE LOST I DON'T CARE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO A LIVING STANDARDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BUT I DO CARE WHAT HAPPENS THERE'S PEOPLE BREAKS IT MIGHT I I DO I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ADDRESS VOTER CONCERNS ON IMMIGRATION AND SOME ON AND THEN AND SOME OF THEM ARE AMONGST THE LOWEST PAID IT IN THE LEAST WELL OFF AND I'LL SORT HER NIGHTIE I'M JUST ADDRESSING HIS POINT THAT SOMEHOW
THERE'S AN ECONOMIC CHAOS AS A PRICE WORTH PAYING I'M SAYING THE BRICKS IT MIGHT BE FOR THE VERY RICH IT'S NOT A COUNTRY BUT IT IS THE PEOPLE ON LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES WHO WILL BE AFFECTED IS THE PEOPLE WITH JOB INSECURITY WHO WILL LOSE THEIR JOB THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY THE PRICE FOR THIS ENORMOUS LEAP IN THE DARK AND BY THE WAY WHEN WE WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR
NEXT THURSDAY THERE IS NO COMING BACK WE'RE NOT GONNA BE REJOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION IN YEARS TO COME WHEN WE THINK WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE IT WILL BE A ONE WAY EXIT
AND THAT IS GOING TO LIVE WITH US NOW ON A STATION IS THERE AND IT'S A SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THAT IT DID THE GUARDIAN IS REPORTING THIS MORNING THAT A DOWNING STREET IS CONSIDERING WHETHER THEY COULD BE ANYTHING MORE TO OFFER IN TERMS OF PERHAPS CONTROLS ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT WOULD REASSURE VOTERS WHO WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE OPEN DOOR TO THIS COUNTRY FOR YOU CITIZENS IS THERE BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PLAN AND THE PLAN IS TO RESTRICT THE WELFARE THAT PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY COME TO THIS COUNTRY SO YOU DON'T GET OUT UNTIL YOU PUT IN AND THAT IS THE PLAN WE WILL IMPLEMENT WITH THE AGREEMENT OF OUR PARTNERS AND IT IS PART OF A MULTI PRONGED ATTACK TO DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION CONTROLLING IT FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. DEALING WITH ABUSES OF FREE MOVEMENT
ALSO CRUCIALLY SEEING EUROPEAN ECONOMY IS NOW GROWING ACTUALLY AT ROUGHLY THE SAME RATE ARE YOU SURE COMFORTABLE I'LL HELP I'M DREADFUL WITH NET MIGRATION FROM THE E.U. BEING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND LAST
WELL NO BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE IT REDUCED TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS HOW WOULD I DO THAT WHEN I'VE SET OUT YOU NEED TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION FROM OUTSIDE THAT NO I'M NOT IF YOU'RE NOT THAT'S CRUCIAL THING ABOUT OUTSIDE YOU'RE DELIGHTED WITH ALL MY NATION COMES I ASK YOU DO YOU WANT TO REDRESS THAT ABOUT MIGRATION FROM THE E.U. YOU SAID YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE LEVEL IT IS AT THE MOMENT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DRESS IT OR WHAT WILL YOU BRING IT DOWN TO FIRST OF ALL WE WILL ADDRESS IT
BY DEALING WITH THE ABUSE OF FREE MOVEMENT DEALING WITH THE CONCERN THE BRITISH PUBLIC HAVE THAT PEOPLE COME HERE TO CLAIM WELFARE THE VERY BIG ATTRACTION THAT A BIG WELFARE PAYMENTS HAVE OFFERED TO PEOPLE AND SECOND BY MAKING SURE THAT THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY IS GROWING IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACTUALLY THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES WERE GROWING FASTER THAN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY OR INDEED THE BRITISH ECONOMY SO YOU ARE HAVING WE'VE HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD FOR LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE BRITISH ECONOMY HAS DONE WELL
THE EUROZONE HAS BEEN OF COURSE WEEK THAT'S CREATED ITS PROBLEMS NOW THOSE PROBLEMS ARE BEING RESOLVED AND AGAIN ON THE BASIS OF A COUPLE OF YEARS OF DIFFICULTY IN THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES TO CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE E.U. PERMANENTLY I THINK WOULD BE A MASSIVE MISTAKE AND YOU DON'T IN THE END DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
BY WRECKING YOUR ECONOMY PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OR CUTTING THEIR INCOMES THESE ARE NOT THE YOU'VE GOT ANSWERS O.K. DO A PERSON WHO YOU HAVE SET OUT TODAY WHAT YOU AS CHANCELLOR WOULD DO IN A POST BRECHT'S BUDGET THE PROBLEM IS THAT FIFTY SEVEN OF YOUR OWN M.P.S ARE SAYING THEY WOULD SIMPLY VOTE AGAINST ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO VOTED FOR BRICKS AND AND BECAUSE IT WOULD RENEGE ON SO MANY OF YOUR MANIFESTO PLEDGES
WELL FIRST OF ALL HAVE THIS UNUSUAL SITUATION I WAS CHECKING ON THE WAY HERE WHEN THE TODAY PROGRAMME WAS FIRST BROADCAST I THINK IT WAS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN I DOUBT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN YOU HAD A SITUATION WHERE EIGHT CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR CHANCELLOR O.K. BOTH AGREE ON THE SKY MENTION SEE I CAN SEE WHY YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS NOT IT'S NO ASK AUNT IT'S OFF HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PASS A BUDGET ON THE LINES OF WHAT YOU'VE INVOLVED FIFTY BILLION POUNDS OF SPENDING CUTS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX RISES WHEN FIFTY SEVEN OF YOUR OWN M.P.S WOULD VOTE AGAINST IT
WELL I'M POINTING OUT THAT THE KINDA MEASURES WOULD HAVE TO TAKE OUR ONES THAT ANY CHANCELLOR AND ANY GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE HOW WOULD YOU THEN PEAS OF COURSE
DON'T LIKE RAISING TAXES THERE I'M I'M A CONSERVATIVE ALSO BY THE WAY GO ON REDUCING TAXES MY BANISTER REDUCE TAXES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT AND YOU COULDN'T PASS US BUT IF WE REMAIN IN BECAUSE A FIFTY SEVEN IF YOUR M.P.S VOTING LABOUR IS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR SPENDING CUT IF WE IF WE QUIT BUT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY ALISTAIR DARLING WARNING TODAY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO CUT SPENDING LABOUR AND SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT I NOTE FOR THIS LET'S BE CLEAR LET'S BE CLEAR
NO CONSERVATIVE WANTS TO RAISE TAXES LEAST BONY BUT EQUALLY CONSERVATIVES UNDERSTAND AND INDEED I SUSPECT MANY LABOUR POLITICIANS UNDERSTAND YOU CANNOT HAVE CHAOS IN YOUR PUBLIC FINANCES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE HOLE THAT WOULD EMERGE IF WE QUIT THE E.U. AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES BY THE WAY
WHEN I FIRST BECAME THE CHANCELLOR CONSERVATIVE M.P.S VERY RELUCTANTLY VOTED FOR AN INCREASE IN V.A.T. TO FIX THIS I KNOW WE WILL TASTE YOU HAVE CHAOS IN YOUR PARTY AND YOUR OUTLINING SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GET THROUGH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD DO WHAT WAS NEEDED TO DEAL WITH HUGE INSTABILITY IN OUR ECONOMY
AND OF COURSE THE CELTS IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES WOULD IT WOULD IT BE EASY FOR FOLK WHO PAY THEIR TAXES FOR THE PUBLIC OF COURSE NOT BUT WE WOULD HAVE IMPOSED THIS ON A COUNTRY AND THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE IF WE VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE NEXT WEEK
THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER SAFER BETTER OFF WILL BE GOING ON BUILDING THAT ECONOMY CREATING JOBS BUSINESSES WILL BE OUT THERE WORKING HARD TO GROW OUR ECONOMY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE THAT THAT'S LET'S LET'S VOTE FOR THE REPOSITORY FOR UPSIDE AND ALL PEOPLE ALL THE CONCERT OF PEOPLES AND I GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION YOU ARE TRYING TO SCARE THEM WHETHER THEY ARE VOTERS WHETHER YOU'RE THERE IN YOUR PARTY I MEAN THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF PROJECTS HERE IS AN APOCALYPTIC
THIRTY BILLION POUNDS IT'S ALL ON THE PUBLIC FINANCE THIS IS WHAT EVERY INDEPENDENT EXPERT IN THE WORLD IS TELLING US AND JUST LOOK WITH THE PEOPLE VOTING WITH THEIR OWN MONEY THEY'RE NOT BRITISH PEOPLE THEIR INVESTORS IN BRITAIN ALL AROUND THE WORLD YOU KNOW STIRLING IS FALLING MONEY IS COMING OUT OF A STOCK MARKET THERE YOU'VE GOT A BIG COMPANIES LIKE ROLLS ROYCE WARNING THEIR WORKFORCE YOU'VE GOT
BIG PROPERTY DEVELOPER SAME PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING HOMES YOU'VE GOT SMALL BUSINESSES WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE THAT THIS ISN'T WARNING'S JUST FROM A CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR THIS IS REAL MONEY OUT THERE IN THE REAL WORLD AND THIS IS THE IRREVERSIBLE DECISION WE FACE NEXT THURSDAY IF WE WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR WE QUIT THAT YOU TAXES WILL GO UP PUBLIC SPENDING WILL BE CUT AND WILL BE LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YEARS TO COME CHILDREN'S ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
AND THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WELL LISTENING TO THE CHANCELLOR IS ROSS HAWKINS OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO'S IN CHESHIRE THIS MORNING AND YOU WERE TALKING TO VOTERS EARLIER THIS ONE I THINK THEY'RE WITH YOU AGAIN AND THEY'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT THE CHANCELLOR SAID CONVINCED
WELL THEY WERE LISTENING THEY WERE LISTENING TO HIM REFERRING TO THEM WHAT THEY WOULD MAKE OF IT ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MORNINGS I THINK IN THE REFERENDUM SO FAR
THERE ARE THREE VOTERS DIFFERENT VIEWS BUT THEY ALL INSIST THEY'VE GOT AN OPEN MIND THAT START WITH JESS GREEN IS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WORKS IN THIS BOOK SHOP AND COFFEE SHOP I MEAN HERE IN NANTWICH YOU SAY A LOT OF YOUR FRIENDS YOUR YOUNG FRIENDS ARE BASICALLY PRO LEAVE HAVING LISTENED QUITE CLOSELY TO THE CHANCE THAT THERE DO YOU THINK YOU'LL CHANGE THEIR MIND TO YOUR OPINION

THE GREAT START UP WE CAN'T BACK THEM UP AS IT WAS IT FIFTY SEVEN M. PEAS OR SAID THEY WOULDN'T PUT THAT THROUGH THE LABOUR WON'T VOTE FOR IT I THINK TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS AND MAKE MORE SCAREMONGERING IT'S NOT GOING TO TURN CHANGE PEOPLE'S OPINIONS TO STAY IN IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY BUT HE IS THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENT OF THE I.S.S. THINK TANK AND HIS TALK ABOUT SELF IMPOSED AUSTERITY FOR YEARS POTENTIALLY DOES THAT JUST BOUNCE OFF PEOPLE I DON'T THINK A ABOUT STUFF PEOPLE NO I THINK IT
CERTAINLY SIT IN THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO HIS
IT'S CLAIMED THAT HE'S MAKING I DON'T THINK THAT'S NOT MY REASON TO WANT TO STAY IN I DON'T THINK
THEY WILL EVER BE ALLOWED TO CUT THE N.H.S. BUDGET THEY WERE EVER BE ALLOWED TO RAISE TAXES BY THAT MUCH BECAUSE IT HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THERE BUT HE WON'T GET TO PUT THE BUDGET THROUGH IT WON'T GO THROUGH THERE'S NO WAY RON GILCHRIST COMMITTED LEVER AND YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND IMMIGRATION THE CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS DIRECTLY HE SAYS YOU DON'T DEAL WITH THOSE WORRIES ON IMMIGRATION BY WRECKING THE ECONOMY AND PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK
WELL MY ISN'T IT I MEAN IT WASN'T A REPLY REALLY IT NEVER IS WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION TO A POLITICIAN THEY NEVER DO REPLY DEAR LADY ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION OR DIVERT YOU SOME OTHER WAY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WEAR I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REPLY TO THAT REALLY BUT YOU WOULD WOULD YOU TAKE AN ECONOMIC HIT FOR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND IMMIGRATION TO BE ADDRESS WOULD YOU JUST SAY THAT THAT'S WORTH IT AS GEORGE OSBORNE SUGGESTED THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT
WELL HE YES I THINK I WOULD BE NICE TO SEE YOU OH YOU ARE WITHOUT A STRAIGHT OUT ABOUT THAT YES YES I THINK YOU'RE STRAIGHT ARCH THAT QUESTION OF LEAVE AS A LEVER IS YES I THINK IT HURT THE ECONOMY BUT YES I THINK IT'S WORTH IT
THAT'S CORRECT YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE YES LET'S TALK TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN A WAY STEVE LAWSON WHO RUNS THE BOOKSHOP IT COMPLETELY UNDECIDED ON THIS HAVING LISTENED TO THAT ARE YOU ANY CLOSER TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT HOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO VOTE
NOT REALLY AT AT FIRST WHEN THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT WE'RE LOOKING IN THE RECESSION AGAIN HAVING JUST COME THROUGH ON IT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THAT GOT ME REALLY SCARED AND WORRIED
BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT AND I SUPPOSE A BIT LIKE A DIVORCE IT IT'S NEVER EASY BUT MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN THINGS ARE BETTER SO YOU'VE JUST BEEN TELLING ME AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND NINE YOU HAD TO KEEP THIS PLACE ROPING IN NOW OPEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU COULD PAY THE MORTGAGE PAY THE BILLS DOES THAT NOT GIVE YOU A MOMENT WHAT THE CHANCE
IT DID YEAH IT WAS IT WAS SCARY RIGHT OFF WHAT HE SAID BUT WE DID GET THROUGH LAST TIME YOU KNOW THINGS ARE BETTER NOW THAN THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO WE MIGHT BE WE WOULD BE BETTER PREPARED FOR SUCH A SITUATION

THE TIME IS NOW NEARLY EIGHT THIRTY TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND ROB ON ITSELF THE SPORT THANKS MICHELLE HER WELL YOU CAN'T CALL IT A SENSATION BUT A ONE ALL DRAW FOR ICELAND AGAINST PORTUGAL INSANITY END LAST NIGHT CERTAINLY COUNTS AS THE MOST EYE CATCHING RESULT OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN SO FAR ANOTHER PORTUGAL'S RONALDO WAS A SPECIALLY IMPRESSED HE SAID THAT ICELAND'S PLAYING STRATEGY WAS BASED ON A QUOTE SMALL MENTALITY AND THAT THEY WON'T ACHIEVE ANYTHING AT THE YEAR AS WELL
NO ONE'S EXPECTING THEM TO WIN IT OF COURSE BUT THAT SMALL MENTALITY QUOTE HARDLY DOES JUSTICE TO A NATION OF JUST THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND AND IN THE FINALS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME EXCUSE ME WHEN I'M OUT SHOCKED TOO IN THE DAY'S OTHER MATCH AREN'T HUNGRY BEATING AUSTRIA TO ZERO AND THEREFORE TOPPING THE GROUP AS THE FIRST ROUND OF MATCHES COME TO AN END AND SO TO ROUND TWO STARTING TODAY WITH RUSSIA AGAINST SLOVAKIA WITH ALL EYES ON THE CONDUCT OF THE RUSSIANS IN THE STANDS
AS MUCH AS ON THE PITCH TROUBLE INSIDE THE STADIUM IN LILLE MIGHT WELL LEAD TO THE TEAM'S EXPULSION FROM THE TOURNAMENT AND FOR ENGLAND TO THE STAKES ARE HIGH AHEAD OF THEIR GAME AGAINST WALES TOMORROW WHEN OUR SENIOR FOOTBALL REPORTER IAN DENNIS IS WITH THE ENGLAND TEAM IN CHANTIX IAN ALL THIS MUST BE DISTRACTING FOR THE PLAYERS HOW MUCH THEY TRY TO FOCUS ON THE TASK IN HAND
WELL IT IS ROB YES GOOD MORNING I THINK THE F. A. R. A. ACUTELY AWARE THAT THIS THREAT FROM UEFA CERTAINLY ISN'T AN EMPTY ONE SO MUCH SO THAT IN FACT LAST NIGHT MARTIN GLENN THE F.A. CHIEF EXECUTIVE HAD ALREADY ISSUED TWO STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AN E. LETTER TO EVERY MEMBER OF ENGLAND'S TRAVEL CLUB MEMBERS REMINDING THEM TO BE RESPECTFUL TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND TO ALSO STAY SAFE UEFA HAVE ACKNOWLEDGE THE EFFORTS OF THE ENGLISH F.A. WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDED THAT APPEAL FROM THE CAPTAIN WAYNE ROONEY AS WELL AS THE MANAGER
ROY HODGSON WHICH I THINK HE WAS GLAD TO DO THAT ROB BECAUSE THERE IS GENUINE CONCERN WITHIN THE F.A. WITH THIS THREAT OF AN EXPLOSION AT TURNING TO TEENS THEMSELVES AND IT'S A VERY PROVOCATIVE HEADLINES IN THE NEWSPAPERS MORNING AMONGST THEM YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WEAR A SHIRT THAT'S THE BACK PAGE LEAD IN THE DAILY MIRROR HAVE GOT EXACTLY WHAT WALES GARETH BALE SAID ABOUT ANY OF THE ENGLAND PLAYERS OF COURSE BUT HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T BUY INTO THE IDEA THAT ENGLAND HAVE A BETTER SQUAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS JUST A MEDIA WAR OR DO YOU SENSE THE TWO SQUADS HAVE SOME KIND OF GENUINE ANTIPATHY
I THINK IT'S ALL PART OF THE THE GAMES FROM THE HEIGHT FOR THE PART AND PARCEL OF THE MEDIA IF YOU LIKE IT'S A BIT LIKE TWO BOXES ON STAGE IN A PRE FIGHT BUILD UP IF YOU LIKE I THINK DEEP DOWN THERE'S A LOT OF RESPECT I MEAN YOU'VE HAD GARETH BALE SAY WALES HAVE GOT MORE PRIDE AND PASSION WILL SHE WAS CLAIMED ENGLAND HAVE THE BETTER PLAYERS AND THEN YESTERDAY THE GARETH BALE WHO I'VE GOT TO SAY WAS SMILING THROUGHOUT
WHEN HE GAVE THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT NO ENGLISH PLAYERS WOULD ACTUALLY GET INTO THE WALES TEAM BUT I SPELT WITHOUT AN LA LANA YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS AND HE SAYS THAT EVERY PLAYER IS GIVING THE MEDIA LINES AND IN HIS OPINION IT JUST ADDS TO THE ATMOSPHERE FINAL THOUGHT HE AND INTERESTING ENGLISH GOALSCORER AGAINST RUSSIA ERIC DYER SO HE DOESN'T FEEL AN INTRICATE PART OF THE SQUAD YOU'D IMAGINE HE'LL KEEP HIS PLACE TOMORROW I SUPPOSE BUT HE'S ROY HODGSON COMPLET CONTEMPLATING ANY CHANGES HIS RHYME STERLING VULNERABLE FOR INSTANCE
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK IF ANYTHING ROY HODGSON MIGHT LOOK TO MAYBE TWEAK IT BUT I WOULDN'T AT ALL BE SURPRISED IF HE NAMED AND UNCHANGED SIDE ONLY BECAUSE AND SPEAKING TO A LOT OF THE PLAYERS THEY WERE VERY VERY CONFIDENT WITH HOW THEY PERFORMED IT WAS IT WAS A DRAW THAT FELT LIKE A DEFEAT BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE THERE WAS MORE POSITIVES THE NEGATIVES SO I WOULD EXPECT ROY HODGSON TO NAME AN UNCHANGED SIDE AGAINST WALES OH KAY AND DENNIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ELSEWHERE THAT THEY REMAIN YOUR PLACE SWITZERLAND AT FIVE O'CLOCK THEIR MATCH IN PARIS

THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WOULD LEAVE HIM WITH NO OPTION BUT TO INTRODUCE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET BUT THIRTY BILLION POUND PACKAGE OF TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS FIFTY SEVEN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WHO WANT A BRITISH EXIT OUT OF ONE MISTER OSBORNE HIS POSITION WOULD BE UNTENABLE IF YOU WENT AHEAD WITH THE CUTS BUT THE CHANCELLOR TOLD US ABOUT TO LEAVE WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO SELF IMPOSED AUSTERITY AND RECESSION
THE LEAVE GROUP HAS SET OUT WHAT IT THINKS OF BRITISH GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO IF EDWIN'S SIR CAMPAIGN IT WOULD AIM TO SETTLE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO END THE ROLE OF THE E.U. CHARGES IN BRITISH LAW AND TO ABOLISH THE A. T. ON HOUSEHOLD ENERGY BILLS
TWO WOMEN HAVE ALLEGED THEY WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED AS TEENAGERS BY THE LATE LIBERAL M.P. AND BROADCASTER SIR CLEMENT FREUD HIS WIDOW SAID SHE WAS PROFOUNDLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED SEARCH TEAMS NEARER DISNEY RESORT IN OR LAND IT WERE TRYING TO FIND A TWO YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS SNATCHED BY AN ALLIGATOR THE CHILD'S FATHER WAS UNABLE TO SAVE HIM WHEN HE WAS DRAGGED BELOW THE SURFACE OF A LAGOON
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE LATE SIR CLEMENT FREUD LIBERAL M.P. BROADCASTER CHEF AND RACONTEUR IS THE LATEST ONE IN FIGURE TO BE ACCUSED OF CHILD SEX ABUSE SYLVIA WAS LEE WHO'S NOW IN HER SEVENTIES SAYS HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER FROM THE AGE OF FOURTEEN FOR FIVE YEARS I WAS FEELING
SOMETHING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS IT I DIDN'T
I HAD THIS DIDN'T REACT IN ANY WAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I WEREN'T THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANGRY BECAUSE HE WAS NICE TO ME
HE WAS REALLY DULL TO GROWN UP AN OLDER CHILD SO YOU KNOW I CAN STILL
THEY LOVE DID YOU THAT'S ALL I HEARD ALL THE TIME SYLVIA WEASLEY WHO WHEEL YOU CAN SEE ON I.T.V.'S EXPRESS EXPOSURE PROGRAMME TONIGHT WELL LUKE DENNIS FROM THE PROGRAMME RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE RESEARCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW YOU DOING HOW DID YOU COME ACROSS THIS STORY I DIDN'T PERSONALLY COME ACROSS A SYLVIA HAD IN A REFLECTIVE MOMENT CHOSEN TO WRITE HER MANUSCRIPTS WHICH DETAILED TO THE EVENTS OF HER LIFE
AND SHE PASSED IT ON TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND I'M PART OF THIS FEATURED WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS A CHILD'S OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE THING THAT JUMPED OUT TO THEM I'M ALARMED THEM AND THEY PASS IT ON TO A FRIEND WHO KNEW DAVID HENSHAW WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER HARD CASH PRODUCTIONS AND HE SORT OF READ THIS AND SAID
YOU KNOW LET'S TAKE THIS TO I.T.V. THEY MADE JIMMY SEVERAL AND THEN WE SORT OF WENT FROM THERE REALLY BUT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN SAY LOOK SOME ONE WOMAN IS CLAIMING SOMETHING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO TO THE POINT AT WHICH YOU GO TO THE PROGRAMME THERE'S SOME CORROBORATION YOU NEED TO DO HOW ABSOLUTELY
WHAT WHAT WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO ESTABLISH SO IT WAS IT WAS A VERY LONG PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY WE HAD TO TAKE THE ALLEGATIONS WITH A DOSE OF SCEPTICISM AS YOU DO WITH ANY STORY AND SORT OF LOOK FOR EVIDENCE RATHER THAN JUST ASSUMING THAT THEY WERE CORRECT
HOWEVER AS WE SORT OF LOOKED INTO THINGS AND THESE ARE EVENTS HAVE SORT OF SIXTY YEARS AGO SO IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND PEOPLE ALIVE BUT WE DID ACTUALLY MANAGED TO FIND THE SON OF A LODGER WHO WAS LIVING IN THE FREUD HOUSEHOLD AT THE TIME IF YOU SENT US A LETTER
DETAILING THAT HE'D BEEN TOLD A STORY BY HIS MOTHER WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER ABOUT HOW CLEMENT FREUD HAD BEEN SNEAKING UP TO THIS YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM AT NIGHT AND SECRETLY SLEEPING WITH HER SO AT THAT POINT WE THOUGHT
THERE'S THERE'S GOT TO BE SORT OF MORE OUT THERE AND WE STARTED TO SORT OF EXPAND OUR RESEARCH AND WE MANAGED TO PLAY SYLVIA IN AND THE HOUSE AT THE TIME THREE SCHOOL RECORDS FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AT THE AGE THAT SHE SAID SHE WAS LOTS OF OTHER DETAILS AGAIN WHICH IS SORT OF CO OPERATED THE DATE

YES SHE SHE CLAIMS SHE WAS RAPED SHE SAYS SHE WAS GROOMED BY HIM AS A TEENAGE GIRL AND THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO STORIES ARE QUITE STRIKING AS A YOUNG TEENAGER CLEMENT FREUD WAS CLOSE TO HER FAMILY IN THE SAME WAY THAT SHE WAS WITH SYLVIA WEASLEY AND HE WOULD WRITE HER LETTERS AND TAKE YOU ON TRIPS TO PARLIAMENT AND MAKE HER FEEL SPECIAL AND BOTH THESE GIRLS CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE VERY SORT OF SOCIALLY ISOLATED AND I BELIEVE THAT HE PICKED THEM OUT BECAUSE OF THIS
AND WERE YOU ABLE TO CORROBORATE HER CLAIMS AND WHAT WHAT EVIDENCE WEAR YOU OUT A PARTICULAR GIVEN IT SO LONG AGO NDS MADE ANONYMOUSLY IT WAS MADE ON LINE
YEAH WE WERE INDEED SHE CONFIDED IN FRIENDS OF HERS AT THE TIME WHO WE MANAGED TO FIND ON SPOKE TO AND THEY FEATURE IN THE PROGRAMME AS WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS QUITE STRIKING PARTICULARLY A GOOD FRIEND OF HERS WHO ACTUALLY PHONED WHILE CLEMENT FREUD WAS AT THE FLAT THAT EVENING AND WAS IMMEDIATELY ALARM

HE SAID THAT YOU SAW PEOPLE DROPPING TO THE GROUND
DID YOU SEE THE GUNMAN AND YOU RAN TO THE BATHROOM
WHAT HAPPENED I HEARD IT ON THE SINK ACTUALLY TRYING TO COME TO ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD TO THINK WHERE I WAS PHONING
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HAVE BEEN CARL CAN I HIDE SO I WON'T GET HIT IF I DID GET HERE I WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS JUST I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO FEEL ANYTHING WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT BATHROOM WHAT WERE YOU HEARING
I WAS TRYING A BRAIN THERE WAS
END UP TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
PEOPLE RIDGES YELLOWING
A FEW PEOPLE SEEING THEM HERE OR
THOSE PEOPLE TRYING TO JUMP INTO A STAR WHEN THERE WAS IN WRONG AT ALL SO THEY WERE JUST FUNNY AND ON TOP OF EVERYBODY THAT WAS ON THERE
WE JUST KEPT GOING
CASSANDRA WAS EVENTUALLY RESCUED BY THE POLICE ALSO AT THE CLUB THAT NIGHT WERE HER FORTY NINE YEAR OLD COUSIN BRENDAN ARE COOL AND HER SON ISAIAH BOTH WENT TO PULSE EVERY WEEK I THOUGHT AS I WHAT THEN I SEEN I SEEN BRENDA IT'S INTERESTING
NO HAVE YOU BECAUSE THERE IS SEEN HERE IN A LONG TIME I THOUGHT OH GOOD TO SEE FIRMLY THERE DIDN'T YOU SEE IT THEY CAME UP TO ME FOR A LITTLE BIT AND I THOUGHT I'LL BE BACK AND THEN WHEN I CAME BACK WE ARE LINKED UP TOGETHER BUT WHY
WE'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE WE SPLIT
WHEN DID YOU REALISE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM WHEN CALVES TOOK US OUT OF THE BUILDING AND WE WERE ACROSS THE STREET PLANNING ANOTHER BUILDING AS IT CAME UP TO ME SCREAMING

SOMEBODY ELSE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A ONE OFF OR IT'S SOMETHING I'M CONFUSED I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULDN'T DO THIS'LL DO WON'T IT
I'M SCARED NOW I DON'T WANT TO GO TO ONE WAY AND ONE A GOOD GAP STATION AND I WANT TO GO ANYWHERE
WHEN SHE LOOKS BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED CASSANDRA WISHES SHE COULD HAVE FOUGHT BACK I HONESTLY WISH I HAD MY LICENCE TO HAVE A GO
AT THAT POINT BECAUSE I NEED IT IF I HAD MY LICENCE I PUT IT I COULD PROBABLY
WHEN IT HAD BEEN OTHER PEOPLE SAY
BUT IF THERE WAS TIGHTER GUN CONTROL IN THEIR ATTACKER WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUY THOSE GUNS LEGALLY SO EASILY I THINK I HAVE A GUN CONTROL
FROM MY EXPERIENCE THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT THINGS UNTIL THEN GET A LICENCE COS
CASSANDRA MARKERS WERE SPEAKING TO OUR REPORTER REGGIE AND IF I DO NATHAN IN ORLANDO IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE HAD A SHORT TIME AGO FROM THE CHANCELLOR WARNING US THAT IF WE VOTED OUT OF THE E.U. HE WOULD HAVE TO DELIVER AN EMERGENCY BUDGET ONE IN WHICH HE WOULD SLASH PUBLIC SPENDING AND RAISE TAXES TO MAKE UP THE THIRTY BILLION POUND BLACK HOLE THERE WOULD BE IN THE COUNTRY'S FINANCES
THE FIFTY SEVEN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WHO ARE IN FAVOUR OF EXIT HAVE SIGNED LETTER SAYING THAT THEY WOULD BLOCK ANY SUCH MOVE AND ONE OF THEM IS STEVE BAKER HE CO CHAIRS THE CONSERVATIVES FOR BRITAIN CAMPAIGN GROUP JOINS US ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THIS IS
SEEMS TO GO BEYOND CRITICISM ALMOST TO INSURRECTION I MEAN IT'S OPEN WARFARE IN THE PARTY NOW I DO YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS NOT OPEN WATER AT MY LEVEL AT MY LEVEL COLLEAGUES ARE STILL GETTING ON PERFECTLY WELL IN FACT ON THE WAY TO THE STUDIO I SAW TWO COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EXCHANGE CHEERY WORDS AND CHEERY GREETING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS A SCARY STORY EH CAMPAIGN TACTICS THIS IS NOT A BUDGET THIS IS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO WHIP UP FEAR TO TRY AND SECURE A POLITICAL POLITICAL OBJECTIVE SO
IT'S NOT OPEN WARFARE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RESPONDING TO A CAMPAIGN TACTIC BY SAYING WE WILL NOT ALLOW A PUNISHMENT BUDGET PERPETRATED AGAINST THE POOR THE SICK THE DISABLED AND THE OLD BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU SAY YOU WON'T SUPPORT A BUDGET IT'S EFFECTIVELY A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE
IF THIS BUDGET COMES FORWARD WE WILL OPPOSE IT IF IT COMES FORWARD AS A PUNISHMENT BUDGET BUT LET'S BE CLEAR WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO COME FORWARD AS A BUDGET WE WHEN THIS WAS PRESENTED TO COLLEAGUES LAST NIGHT THEY MET THIS PROPOSAL WITH DERISION AND CONTEMPT IT IS JUST A SCARY STORY A CAMPAIGN TACTIC DESIGNED TO PUT PEOPLE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY THINK TWICE ABOUT THEIR VOTE ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOUR CHANCELLOR DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NETTED
I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARY AND WELL I'M NOT ASKING YOU THAT DO YOU ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOUR OWN YOUR FELLOW CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY HE'S PURELY SAYING IT FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS I THINK THAT HE IS IN FACT SAYING THIS AS A CAMPAIGN TACTIC
IN ORDER TO GET HIM THROUGH A WEEK WHERE THEY'VE GOT NOTHING POSITIVE TO SAY ABOUT OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP AND IF WE VOTED OUT OF THE E. YOU HOW DO YOU THINK THE CHANCELLOR WOULD RESPOND AFTER THAT DO YOU THINK HE WOULDN'T CALL AN EMERGENCY BUDGET DESPITE WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TODAY I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT HE WOULD NOT BRING FORWARD THIS BUDGET AFTER THE VOTE I AM CONFIDENT AFTER THE VOTE ALL OF THE BIG PLAYERS IN GOVERNMENT WHO CAN SHIFT EXPECTATIONS AND CREATE UNCERTAINTY WOULD CHANGE THEIR TUNE VERY QUICKLY THE PRIME MINISTER
THE CHANCE OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WOULD ALL BE UNITED VERY QUICKLY IN CREATING STABILITY AND CALM PROMOTING PROSPERITY WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE THIS IS A SCARY STORY A CAMPAIGN TACTIC IT'S NOT A SERIOUS BUDGET AND IT SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BUT HIS ARGUMENT OF COURSE IS THAT IT IS ABOUT STABILITY THAT IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT THAT THE COUNTRY THE FINANCES ARE STABLE IN THE EVENT OF
AN UNKNOWN SITUATION WELL IT'S NOT AN UNKNOWN SITUATION BECAUSE THE DAY AFTER THE VOTE NOTHING CHANGES IN LAW WE'VE COME AN AWFULLY LONG WAY SINCE LORD ROSE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN WAS TELLING US THAT NOT MUCH WOULD CHANGE IT WOULD BE A GRADUAL PROCESS THE TRUTH IS HE HE HE SAID THAT BECAUSE HE HADN'T BEEN GOT TO BY THE SPIN DOCTORS THAT HE HE KNEW THAT IF HE SET OUT THAT THE TRUTH YOU COULD HAVE A REASONABLE CONVERSATION BUT ACTUALLY TODAY THE TRUTH WAS IN THIS REGARD
IS NOW A LONG DISTANT MEMORY BUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STOCK MARKET'S YESTERDAY WHAT'S HAPPENED TO STIRLING RECENTLY AND THIS IS JUST WITH A WEEK A WEEK TO GO OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE EVENT OF A VOTE TO LEAVE THERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EITHER STERLING OR THE MARKETS AFTER THE VOTE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT ALL THE BIG PLAYERS WITH SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INSTEAD OF CAMPAIGNING FOR A PARTICULAR OUTCOME
THEY WILL CHANGE WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL STABILISE THE MARKETS AND WE WILL GO ON AS BEFORE I THINK IT'S WORTH BUT WE HAVE A PROPER PROSPECT PROSPECTUS PUT FORWARD THIS SYMPTOM TODAY BY THOSE IN THE LEAVE LIT ON THE LEAVES SIDE SUGGESTING THAT ACTUALLY
THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD NOT DO WHAT HE SAID HE'LL DO WHICH IS TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY THE PROCESS OF LEAVING INSTEAD THERE SHOULD BE FOUR YEARS OF THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP A NEW SETTLEMENT AND FOUR YEARS BEFORE EFFECTIVELY THERE ARE ANY CHANGES
WHEN THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE TOOK EVIDENCE ON THESE ISSUES DROP FROM SIR JOHN CUNLIFFE HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRICK AT THE ARTICLE FIFTY UNTIL WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE GOING TO GET THAT WAS HIS ADVICE AND THE TREASURY COMMITTEE MADE AN APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATION IN OUR REPORT AND SAID THAT IT WOULD BE AND I PUT IT WHAT ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE THAT'S BEEN SET OUT TODAY WHICH IS THAT YOU SET UP YOU TAKE HER FOOT THAT IT'S A FOUR YEAR PROCESS OR NOTHING CHANGES FOR FOUR YEARS AND DURING THAT TIME YOU
TRY TO RENEGOTIATE WHATEVER NEW SETTLEMENTS SO I'M VERY PROUD THAT WE'VE SET OUT A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR EMERGENCY BILL TO RESTRICT THE PARROT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE TO ZERO RATE V.A.T. TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE N.H.S. TO GET IMMIGRATION UNDER CONTROL AND START DOING OUR OWN TRADE DEALS THESE ARE AFTER ALL THE SUBSTANCE OF EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR NOT ONLY OVER THE LAST YEAR SINCE I LAUNCHED CONSERVATIVES WRITTEN BUT IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT
THIS IS A POSITIVE VISION TO TAKE BACK CONTROL SPEND OUR MONEY ON OUR PRIORITIES AND DELIVER THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT THAT BRITISH PEOPLE CAN BE PROUD OF AND MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS AND SAY IT'S FANCIFUL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PULLING OUT OF ALL THE BITS OF THE OF THE E.U. THAT YOU DON'T WANT BUT STILL HAVING FREE TRADE SORT OF
GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE BUT KEEPING EVERYTHING HAPPY AND HAVING ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF MARRIAGE IT'S A MATTER OF FACT FREE TRADE TAKES PLACE IN EUROPE FROM ICELAND DOWN TO TURKEY EVERYBODY'S A PART OF IT AND IT'S QUITE ABSURD TO SUGGEST THAT WE WOULDN'T BE TRADING IN FACT THE PRIME MINISTER APPEARED ON THE MARKED MARCEAU AND SAID WE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE TRADING OR DOM WHO GOT THE QUOTE TO HAND AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY SCARE STORIES ABOUT IT AND NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE
THE REALITY IS WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRADE AND IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT THE PUBLIC CAN GO TO A SHOP AND BUY ALL SORTS OF PRODUCTS MADE IN CHINA WITH HIM WE HAVE NO TRADE DEAL WE DO MORE SERVICES BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITHOUT WHOM WE HAVE NO TRADE DEAL WITH THIS WE'LL BE ABSOLUTELY FINE SINCE DID THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TEN TO NINE TWO SCULPTURES BY DAME BARBARA HEPWORTH HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR MORE THAN TWO MILLION POUNDS AFTER BEING AUCTIONED OFF BY HER OLD SCHOOL THEY FETCH DOUBLE THE ASKING PRICE IN A SALE AT SOTHEBY'S WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY DOCTOR CAROL ATACK WHO ATTENDED WAKEFIELD GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL WHICH END THE SCULPTURES BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO BARBARA HEPWORTH I LEFT IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN GOOD MORNING DOCTOR GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS SALE
I FEEL SAD AND THAT THE CURRENT GENERATION AND FUTURE GIRLS AT THE SCHOOL WON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH THESE FABULOUS PIECES
ART AND TO SHARE IN THE HERITAGE OF THE SCHOOL AND BE INSPIRED BY DAME BARBARA IN THE WAY I WAS WHEN I ATTENDED THE SCHOOL AND THE GIRLS HAVE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS MANY OF WHOM WORKED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF A SKULL ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF THE SCULPTURES AREN'T DID
A BIG GIVES SO THEY WERE ON DISPLAY WHEN YOU WERE AT THE SCHOOL ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE FOR SOME TIME THIS THE SCHOOL SAYS THAT BECAUSE OF THE RISING COST OF INSURANCE THEY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DISPLAY THEM WELL INDEED AREN'T ONE OF THE SCULPTURES QUIET FORMED MARBLE PIECE THAT MADE MOST OF THE MONEY WAS ON DISPLAY AT THE HEPWORTH MUSEUM WHICH WAS OPENED FIVE YEARS AGO TO SHOWCASE DAME BARBARA'S WORK AND CAREER
IN WAKEFIELD SO I'M ALSO VERY SAD THAT THE WORKS HAVE GONE INTO A PRIVATE COLLECTION AND NOT INTO ONE OF INTO THAT GREAT CULTURAL RESOURCING ALWAYS FELT THEIR MONEY AND PRESUMABLY THERE WAS MORE MONEY AVAILABLE FROM THIS BRIGHT PRIVATE BY THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM A GALLERY AND IT WILL GO TOWARDS BURSARIES
FOR PUPILS SO FOR THE BENEFIT OF GIRLS WERE AT THE SCHOOL NOW AND THOSE IN THE FUTURE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT GIRLS
MANY GIRLS CAN HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE SAME GREAT EDUCATION FOR I HAD BUT I'M SELLING THESE SCULPTURES WASN'T THE ONLY WAY TO RAISE MONEY AND THERE'S A BIGGER QUESTION ABOUT
THEY VALUE YOU KNOW DO WE VALUE ART AND OUR CONNECTION WITH THE PAST PURELY IN MONETARY TERMS FOR ARTISTS WORKING WITH SCHOOLS NOW ARE THEY DOING THAT WORK
FOR ENHANCEMENT AND CULTURAL BENEFIT OR TO CREATE SOMETHING AN ASSET THAT THE SCHOOL CAN'T FLOG OFF NEXT TIME IT WANTS TO MAKE AN ASSET THAT WASN'T ON DISPLAY IN ANY EVENT SO GIRLS WERE AT THE SCHOOL NOW WOULDN'T HAVE WELL I THINK I THINK I DO HURT I DO THINK THAT'S A GREAT SHAME AND THAT AND THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS
THAT MAKING AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE HEPWORTH FOR EXAMPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE ENABLED BOTH GIRLS AT THE SCHOOL AND MANY MORE PEOPLE AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY
TO SEE THAT I MEAN QUIET FORM WAS VERY PERSONAL PIECE THAT COMMEMORATES DAME BARBARA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL AND HER AFFECTION FOR MISS NOT THE FORMER HEADMISTRESS COURAGE TO A GREAT DEAL THANK YOU SO SO IT'S
IT'S A REAL A REAL SHAME THAT THAT LINK BETWEEN ART AND ITS PLACE AND CONTEXT HAS BEEN BROKEN DOCTOR CAROL LATEX THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE WHEELCHAIR USER WHO COULDN'T TRAVEL ON A BUS BECAUSE HER MOTHER WITH HER CHILDREN'S BUGGY REFUSED TO MOVE FROM THE WHEELCHAIR SPACE IS TAKING HIS CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT TODAY THE OUTCOME OF DOUG PAULIE'S CASE FOR UNLAWFUL DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION COULD HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR BUS AND TRAIN COMPANIES YOU MAY HAVE TO GO FURTHER THAN ASKING AND ACTUALLY FOURTH ABLE BODIED PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF DISABLED SPACES ARE LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN REPORTS
HERE THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A MAN GETTING ON A BUS OR TRYING TO AND HOW IT LED TO A FOUR YEAR LEGAL BATTLE
IN TWENTY TWELVE DOUG POORLY TRYING TO BOARD A BUS FROM WETHERBY TO LEEDS AND THERE WAS A PROBLEM I WENT TO WETHERBY WE'VE GOT ON THE BUS WITH HIM SO WELL
MAYBE SOMEBODY WITH A BUGGY IN THE WAY
WHEN I WENT TO GET ON THE BUS THE DRIVER ASKED IF THEY WERE
UNFORTUNATELY REFUSED TO DO SO AND I WASN'T ABLE TO GET ON
I CAN SEE THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
REMOVE ALL YOUR SHOPPING MAYBE WITH A TOP OF THE ROOM
THEY WILL
DOUG POORLY SUED THE BUS COMPANY FIRST GROUP AND WON A RULING THAT ITS POLICY OF REQUESTING BUT NOT REQUIRING ABLE BODIED PEOPLE TO MOVE FROM THE DISABLED SPACE WAS UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION
BUS COMPANIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES SHOULD NOT BE LEGALLY OBLIGED TO FORCE PASSENGERS TO MAKE WAIT FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS EVEN IN THEIR JUDGEMENT IN DOUG'S FAVOUR WAS REVERSED BY THE COURT OF APPEAL WHICH RULED THAT ALTHOUGH WHEELCHAIR USERS HAVE PRIORITY TO OCCUPY THE WHEELCHAIR SPACE THERE'S NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR BUS DRIVERS TO MOVE OTHER PASSENGERS FROM IT
IT'S IN A SUIT EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE BUGGY WILLING MUMS OF WETHERBY SEEM TO HAVE A VIEW ON UNABLE TO FOLD MY BOOK AND I CAN I CAN MY SON UP AND IS ALWAYS SOMEONE TO HELP AND IF YOU CAT WALKING YOU NEED A WHEELCHAIR
AND YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEST THAN I DO IF NECESSARY AND I CRY AFTER FURTHER PUSH SHERIFF I GUESS IT WOULD BE A BIT OF A PAIN COS NINE OF SPADES THAT IS I THINK IT'S TRICKY I THINK WITH THE WHEELCHAIR IT'S NOT AS IF THEY CAN TAKE TO ANOTHER SAVE
THE BABY YOU CAN PUT THE PAN DOWN YEAH YOU IMAGINE IF YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL
BEEN PUT IN THAT POSITION OF WHERE WHERE DO YOU WANT MAKE SO I'M STANDING IN THE DARK OAK PANELLED SPLENDOUR OF CAUGHT ONE AT THE SUPREME COURT WHERE SEVEN JUSTICES WILL DECIDE IF BUS COMPANIES SHOULD SIMPLY ASK MUMS AND OTHERS TO MOVE FROM THE DISABLED SPACE OR MAKE THE MOVE
FIRST GROUP MAINTAIN ITS POLICY OF REQUESTING NOT REQUIRING OTHERS TO VACATE THE WHEELCHAIR SPACE IS LAWFUL GILES FEARNLEY IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ITS BUS GROUP FIRST BUS IT IS VERY RARE FOR A PASSENGER TO REFUSE TO MOVE
DRIVERS WILL WE'LL ASK A PASSENGER IN THE STRONGEST POLITEST WAY THEY CAN TO MOVE OR WE TRAIN THEM TO DO SO WHEN SOMEBODY DOES REFUSED TO MOVE ITS EXTRAORDINARY UNFORTUNATE WHO DO BELIEVE FOR THE POST WE TAKE IS THE MOST FEASIBLE DOUG PAUL HIS APPEAL IS THE FIRST DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CASE INVOLVING THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC TO BE HEARD IN THE SUPREME COURT AND FOR HIM
IT'S ABOUT FAR MORE THAN SIMPLY MISSING THE BUS IT'S ABOUT BEING REASONABLE
ORGANISATIONS HAVE TO MAKE SO THAT DISABLED PEOPLE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE THINGS OTHER PEOPLE IN SOCIETY TAKE FOR GRANTED
CLIVE COLEMAN REPORTING THERE AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY BARONESS BENTON WHO IS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS PARTY PRESIDENT IS IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HAS THIS SAME THING HAPPEN TO YOU HAVEN'T I HAVE JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE NEAR EMPTY BUS AND A DAD AND A BUGGY WHO WOULD NOT EVEN MOVE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO LET ME INTO THE WHEELCHAIR STOP THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ROOM FOR THE BUGGY TO COME BACK IN FRONT OF ME
WOULDN'T DO IT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE LAW BECAUSE THE DRIVER HAS NO POWER TO REQUIRE SO IT'LL BE VERY INTERESTING IN THE COURT TO HEAR TODAY THERE'S A REQUIREMENT ON BUS COMPANIES NOW TO HAVE A WHEELCHAIR SPACE BUT NO REQUIREMENT UNDER LAW TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEELCHAIRS CAN USE IT THAT'S THE ANOMALY SO WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR CASE THE CONDUCTOR AND THE DRIVER AND I TRIED TO PERSUADE THE DAD JUST TO MOVE HE REFUSED POINT BLANK
I COULDN'T GET ON THE BUS COS THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN GO IN A WHEELCHAIR HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR SPACE SO I HAD TO WAVE FAREWELL TO THE BUS AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE
BUT YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT HE COULD HAVE MOVED OVER THERE ON MOST BUSES THERE IS SPACE FOR HIM AND I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS ON THE DESIGN OF BOTH THE WHEELCHAIR AND THE BUGGY BUT THERE IS TYPICALLY SPACE WERE BOTH THERE IS USUALLY THE WHEELCHAIR SPACES DEEP ENOUGH FOR A WHEELCHAIR TO BE ABLE TO REVERSE INTO AND THEN SLOT A BUGGY IN FRONT I'VE NOT SEEN A BUS WHERE YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU WOULD LIKE THAT ONE BUGGY OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IF YOU WOULD LIKE THE COURT TO MAKE IT A REQUIREMENT BUT IT IS WORKABLE
IN MOST CASES IT WILL BE I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF THE BUS IS ABSOLUTELY FULL OF STANDING PASSENGERS THERE'S NOWHERE WHEELCHAIR USER COULD INSIST ON EVERYONE ELSE GETTING OFF THE BUS SO THEY COULD GET IN THERE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS MAKING A SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE WHEELCHAIR USER TO GET INTO AN AREA OF SPACE NOT JUST SAFE FOR THEM BUT ALSO SAFE FOR OTHER PASSENGERS AND GO DOWN TAKE THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU WERE IN WHEN THE SENSIBLE REASONABLE THING WOULD HE SHOULD HAVE MOVED OVER AND YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE HE WASN'T CLEARLY WASN'T BEING IT FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT
SO WHAT COULD THE BUS DRIVER OR WHAT SHOULD THE BUS DRIVER HAVE DONE UNDER THAT IF THE LAW CHANGE IF THE LAW CHANGES THEY WOULD BE THE ABILITY FOR THE BUS REGULATIONS TO BE ENFORCED A PENALTY IN THE SAME WAY AS SOMEBODY NOT PAYING A FAIR TO BE HANDED OUT WHO WOULD BE AN ISSUE OF LAST RESORT BUT IT WOULD EMPOWER THE DRIVERS TO BE ABLE TO SAY LOOK YOU REALLY DO NEED TO MOVE IT'S ACTUALLY A REQUIREMENT IN THE MOMENT
WHOLE POINT OF THIS APPEAL IS GOING TO TURN ONE REQUIREMENT IT IS BUT IT WILL IT WILL COULD MEAN WHEELCHAIR USERS EFFECTIVELY KICKING A MUM AND A BUGGY OFF A VERY UNUSUAL FOR THAT TO HAPPEN COS AS THE MUMS HAVE JUST SAID USUALLY THE MUMS CAN GET THE BABIES OUT SIT THEM ON THEIR LAPS THIS PRIORITY SEATS FOR THEM BARONESS SELL BRINTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL FROM US OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE SARAH NELSON AND TIM TO FARM AND AFTER THE NEWS LIBBY PURVES AND GUESS FOR MID WEEK FROM ALL OF US A VERY GOOD MORNING
