OF WHICH THERE ARE A FEW
OUR COASTLINE IS PRETTY MUCH UNDEFENDED AND CERTAINLY UNDEFENDED WHEN YOU COMPARE IT
THE FRENCH OR THE ITALIAN

EFFORTS TO BRING PEACE TO SYRIA HAVE SUFFERED A NEW SETBACK WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR FROM THE COUNTRY'S MAINSTREAM OPPOSITION MUHAMMAD ALI LOUCHE SAYS HE'S QUITTING THE HIGHER NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE BECAUSE U.N. BACKED PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA HAVE NOT BROUGHT A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT OR EASE THE PLIGHT OF SYRIANS MORE DETAILS FROM FAHAD A DOWARD
THIS IS ANOTHER BLOW TO THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS WHICH HAVE BEEN STALLED SINCE APRIL FOUR MONTHS THE HIGH NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE HAS SPOKEN OF THEIR FRUSTRATIONS THEY'VE BEEN ANGERED BY THE LACK OF HUMANITARIAN AID REACHING BESIEGED AREAS
THE SLOW RELEASE OF POLITICAL DETAINEES AND THE ABSENCE OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS A POLITICAL TRANSITION IN SYRIA WITHOUT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL SADE
A NATIONWIDE TRUTH BETWEEN REBEL AND GOVERNMENT FORCES BROKERED BY THE U.S. AND RUSSIA IS OFFICIALLY STILL IN PLACE BUT IS FREQUENTLY VIOLATED
A WOMAN IS FEARED DEAD AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY A CROCODILE OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA SHE WAS SWIMMING WITH HER FRIEND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE CROCODILE STRUCK FROM SYDNEY FILM MERCER REPORTS
IT WAS TEN THIRTY AT NIGHT AND TWO WOMEN WERE SWIMMING IN WAIST DEEP WATER AT THORNTON BEACH IN THE DAINTREE NATIONAL PARK NORTH OF CAIRNS A FEW TERRIFYING MOMENTS LATER ONE HAD DISAPPEARED DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF HER FRIEND WHO TRIED TO GRAB HER OFF TO THE CROCODILE STRUCK
SO FAR THERE'S BEEN NO TRACE OF THE MISSING WOMAN WHO'S IN HER MID FORTIES EXPERTS SAY A FIVE METRE SALTWATER CROCODILE HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE AREA IN RECENT WEEKS
DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD A HUGE MOTORCYCLE RALLY THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN TREATED BETTER THAN U.S. MILITARY VETERANS THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS SPEAKING AT THE ANNUAL ROLLING THUNDER EVENT IN WASHINGTON D.C. WHICH HONOURS FORMER SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HE SAID CARE FOR VETERANS WOULD IMPROVE IF HE WAS ELECTED TO OFFICE WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR VETS AND IN MANY CASES ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING MUCH CARE REALLY I TAKE IT MUCH BETTER
BY THIS CAR G. J. CAN CURVE THERE ARE VETERANS AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OH KAY IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN ANY LONGER
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF SHOPPERS WHO BUY CLOTHES ONLINE RETURN AT LEAST ONE ITEM THE STUDY FOR YOU ENDURANCE ON RADIO FOUR INDICATES THAT ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE BUYING WOMEN'S CLOTHING SEND SOMETHING BACK SOME BUSINESSES SAY THE COST OF SO MANY RETURNS IS PUSHING UP PRICES FOR CONSUMERS
THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS SOUGHT TO REASSURE ATHLETE'S ABOUT THE RISKS POSED BY THE SEEKER VIRUS AHEAD OF THE PARALYMPIC GAMES WHICH ARE DUE TO START IN RIO IN ONE HUNDRED DAYS SO PHILIP CRAVEN'S HER PARALYMPIANS TAKING PART SHOULD BE SAFE IF THEY STICK TO OFFICIAL ADVICE
SCIENTISTS IN AUSTRALIA SAY MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CORAL IN PARTS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY MASS BLEACHING IT'S THE THIRD TIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE HAS EXPERIENCED BLEACHING BUT THE RESEARCHERS SAY THE DAMAGE CAUSED THIS YEAR IS MORE SERIOUS FROM SYDNEY JOHN DOBSON
THE STUDY CARRIED OUT BY JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY FOUNDED IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF CORAL WAS EITHER DEAD OR DYING THE RESEARCH TEAM DESCRIBED IT AS THE MOST EXTREME CASE OF MASS BLEACHING THEY'D EVER MEASURED AT THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE
CORAL BLEACHING HAS BEEN LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT HAPPENS WHEN WARMER WATER CAUSES FOR CORAL TO WEAKEN AND LOSE THEIR COLOURFUL ALGAE THAT PROVIDE OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS
THIS LATEST RESEARCH WILL INCREASE CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TO CATEGORISE THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AS IN DANGER SOMETHING IT WAS SO FAR HELD BACK FROM DOING
THE CAMPAIGN GROUP THE TAXPAYERS' ALLIANCE HAS DESCRIBED THE PLANNED SUGAR TAX AS AN ARBITRARY BURDEN ON THE POOR WHICH SHOULD BE SCRAPPED THE ALLIANCE HAS MANY DRINKS INCLUDING SOME BRANDS OF HOT CHOCOLATES ARE LADEN WITH SUGAR BUT EXEMPT FROM THE LEVY THE TREASURY SAID THE SUGAR TAX WAS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN ITS EFFORTS TO TACKLE CHILDHOOD OBESITY
THE DRUM IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX THEN RICHES AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING BILL GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOHN WELL SO FAR THE BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND HAS BROUGHT SUCH A BIT OF A MIX OF WEATHER SOME PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS FOR SOME OF US BUT FOR MANY ACTUALLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF DRY WEATHER AND I THINK THROUGH TODAY IT IS GOING TO STAY DRY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY AND FOR MANY THERE'LL BE SOME SUNSHINE AS WELL I'LL BEGIN WITH A FORECAST FOR SOUTH WEST ENGLAND FROM WALES
FOR NORTH WEST ENGLAND THAT ALSO FOR SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND BECAUSE IN THESE AREAS IT'S A DRY FAIRLY BRIGHT START THERE IS THE ODD FOG PATCH BUT ANY FOG WON'T LAST VERY LONG AND THEN IT'LL STAY FINE THROUGH THE DAY SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE RIGHTS INTO THE AFTERNOON AND WARM AS WELL WITH HIGHS OF NINETEEN DEGREES FOR GLASGOW AND MANCHESTER TWENTY FOR CARDIFF AND PLYMOUTH
FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND FOR THE MIDLANDS FOR EASTERN ENGLAND FOR NORTH EAST ENGLAND AND ALSO FOR EASTERN SCOTLAND IN THESE AREAS IT IS QUITE A CLOUDY START A GREY MORNING THE ODD SPOT OF DRIZZLE FIRST THING PARTICULARLY FOR HER COASTS AND HILLS BUT GRADUALLY SLOWLY BUT SURELY THINGS SHOULD BRIGHTEN UP WE'LL SEE SUNNY SPELLS DEVELOPING FOR MOST BY THE AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH FOR THE IMMEDIATE NORTH SEA COAST
AND ALSO FOR EAST ANGLIA IT IS LIKELY TO STAY CLOUDY RATHER BREEZY QUITE COOL AS WELL JUST FIFTEEN DEGREES IN NORWICH BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SIXTEEN IN NEWCASTLE SEVENTEEN IN ABERDEEN EIGHTEEN IN BIRMINGHAM TWENTY IN LONDON
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND ALSO FOR NORTHERN SCOTLAND THE ODD FOG PATCH FIRST THING THEY SHOULD CLEAR QUITE QUICKLY AND THEN SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE DAY THE SMALL RISK OF A HEAVY SHOWER THIS AFTERNOON BUT MOST PLACES DRY FOURTEEN DEGREES IN STORNOWAY EIGHTEEN IN BELFAST IN THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT SOME THUNDERY RAIN EVENTUALLY ARRIVING FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN ENGLAND BUT ELSEWHERE IT WILL STATE
BEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE GUARDIAN'S LEAD OF THE ATTACKS ON DAVID CAMERON THAT EMERGED OVER THE WEEKEND PARTICULARLY HER YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON'S HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO AVOID TERMINAL DAMAGE TO CONSERVATIVE PARTY UNITY AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WERE DENTED YESTERDAY WHEN TWO M.P.S OPENLY CALLED FOR A NEW LEADER IN A GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE ATTACKS CAME FROM ANDREW BRIDGEND HE WAS SPEAKING TO JOHN A DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR
AND ALSO FROM NADINE DORIS WHO WAS SPEAKING TO PESTON ON SUNDAY BOTH LONGSTANDING OPPONENTS OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND FOR THE LEAVE A CAMPAIGN THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT EVEN IF AS MANY TORIES EXPECT HER CONFIDENCE VOTE DOES NOT MATERIALISED THE BRIDGEND DORIS COMMENTS ARE A REMINDER OF HOW MAVERICK HARDLINE EURO SCEPTICS WERE ABLE TO PLAY HAVOC WITH JOHN MAJOR'S GOVERNMENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH A SMALL MAJORITY CAMERON'S WORKING MAJORITY IS JUST SIXTEEN
THE TIMES LEAVES WITH A STORY THAT SAYS THE PANEL OF EXPERTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE BRITAIN'S SAFE DRINKING LEVELS CONTAINED SEVERAL ANTI ALCOHOL OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN INSIDER HAS BEEN TALKING TO THE TIMES ARE VOTED THE COMMITTEE'S REPORT YOU MAY REMEMBER LED TO THE WEEKLY LIMIT FOR MEN BEING CUT FROM TWENTY ONE UNITS A WEEK
FOURTEEN UNITS STARK WARNINGS TO WOMEN THAT EVERY GLASS OF WINE RAISE THEIR RISK OF BREAST CANCER THE REPORT PRISON SHE'D MEDICAL OFFICER
WHOEVER PROVOKED AN OUTCRY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THE NEW LIMIT IN GENERALLY DID NOT MENTION THAT FOR KEY FIGURES BEHIND IT WERE MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE OF ALCOHOL THE ALCOHOL STUDIES A LOBBY GROUP FINANCED BY THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT
ON THURSDAY THE NEW THE NEW FIVE POUND NOTE FEATURING WINSTON CHURCHILL IS GOING TO BE UNVEILED AHEAD OF ITS LAUNCH IN SEPTEMBER AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AS A STORE AND IT'S FRONT PAGE ABOUT WHAT IT CALLS A STICKING POINT OF THE NEW PLASTIC FIVE POUND NOTE IS GOING TO HAVE IT'S GOING TO BE THAT THE FIRST NOTE TO HAVE A PLASTIC POLYMER OVERWRITTEN THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT A NUDE THE NEW PLASTIC NOTES ARE PRONE TO STICKING TOGETHER MEANING THAT SHOPPERS WILL BE AT RISK OF HANDING OVER TWO AT ONCE
THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS ADMITTED THAT THE NEW POLYMER NOTES CAN SOMETIMES STICK TOGETHER BUT SAYS THIS EFFECT IS SHORT LIVED A ONCE IN A USE BUT THE THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THIS COULD CREATE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE AS THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO USE CASH BUT MAY NOT NOTICE THE NOTES STICKING TOGETHER
THE DRUM IS NOW TEN PAST SIX THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS ARE STRUGGLING WITHOUT PUTTING IT RATHER MILDLY IMOGEN FOLKS AS A CORRESPONDENT IN GENEVA WHERE THEY ARE HAPPENING ALL THEY ARE MEANT TO BE HAPPENING IMOGEN THE CHIEF PEACE NEGOTIATOR FOR THE OPPOSITION GROUPS OPPOSITION GROUPING HAS RESIGNED
YES THAT'S RIGHT AS YOU SAY THIS WILL PROBABLY PUT THE ALREADY STRUGGLING VERY COMPLEX VERY SLOPEY STOCKS IN GENEVA WILL POSSIBLY CAUSE THEM TO COME TO A GRINDING HALT BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE THIS RESIGNATION WE HAD NO DATE FOR THE TALKS TO RESTART
WE HAD IN THE LAST ROUND NO REAL PROGRESS AND CERTAINLY NO ENGAGEMENT ON THE PART OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO TALK ABOUT POLITICAL TRENT TRANSITION IN SYRIA AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT LIES BEHIND MUHAMMAD AL BOOSTERS RESIGNATION IS THAT NOT ONLY IS HE HE'S NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE FRUSTRATED BUT THERE IS HUGE PRESSURE
FROM HIS CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTING IN SYRIA WHO ARE SAYING
WHAT NURSE ARE YOU GOING TO GENEVA FOR NOTHING'S HAPPENING AND DOWN ON THE GROUND OUR ARAB CITIES ARE BESIEGED WE'RE STARVING AND WERE GETTING BOMBED SO WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS IS THAT I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE KEY REASON THAT HE WENT BUT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WASN'T THERE ME WE DID HAVE I KNOW THEY WERE CALLING IT A CEASEFIRE AS SUCH BUT WE DID HAVE THE SORT OF CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES FOR A WHILE
WE STILL THEORETICALLY HAVE THAT AND WE HAVE THIS RATHER SHY OPERATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS HERE IN GENEVA WHO WERE MONITORING THE FIGHTING ON THE GROUND AND WHEN THEY CAN THE INTERVIEWING WITH THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE CONTACTS OF COURSE WE KNOW THEY DO
AND WE HAVE THE HUMANITARIAN TASK FORCE WHICH IS NEGOTIATING AGE TO BESIEGED AREAS BUT NEITHER OF THEM I'VE BEEN HAVING A HUGE AMOUNT OF SUCCESS WE KNOW THERE IS FIGHTING AROUND THE LEOPARD WE'VE HEARD WARNINGS THAT SELF STYLED ISLAMIC STATE IS MOVING ON TOWARDS THE NORTH NOW AND PEOPLE ARE FLEEING
AND OF THE ESTIMATED MILLION OR MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED AID TO A BESIEGED IN ME ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND WERE REACHED SO THERE'S A LIMITED WOULD BE A POSITIVE WAY OF TALKING ABOUT IT LIMITED SUCCESS SO FAR AND NOT NEARLY ENOUGH OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION REALLY FELT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW
THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN SYRIA AND THAT I THINK IS WHY THEY FEEL IT'S NO LONGER REALISTIC TO TAKE PART IN A JOINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX CLOSING GUANTANAMO BAY WAS ONE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST DIRECTORS WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE BUT AS THE END OF HIS SECOND TERM APPROACHES THE CAMP IS VERY MUCH STILL THERE ON NORTH AMERICA AMERICA CORRESPONDENT ALLY MC BULL HAS BEEN TO SEE IT AND TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PRESIDENT'S AMBITION IS ACHIEVABLE
THEY'RE CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A DETENTION CENTRE THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE BY THE TIME PRESIDENT OBAMA LEEDS OFFICE AND IT WAS ONE OF HIS VERY FIRST PROMISES TO CLOSE IT ON VARIOUS GROUNDS
FIRST OF ALL THAT IT WAS A SORT OF STAIN ON AMERICA'S REPUTATION BUT ALSO THAT IT WAS VERY SYMBOLIC AND IN A SENSE A VERY POWERFUL RECRUITING TOOL FOR ISLAMIST MILITANT GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD
BUT ALSO HE'S BEEN TALKING MUCH MORE RECENTLY PARTICULARLY TO THOSE REPUBLICANS WHO DON'T AGREE ON WHO TO THOSE GROUNDS SO LOOK WE'LL JUST FINANCIALLY IT COSTS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY AND I WENT THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY PRISONERS RELEASED AND WE DOWN FROM
A HIGH OF A FEW YEARS AGO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED TO JUST EIGHTY IT IS A HUGE SPRAWLING COMPLEX ENGLAND HANNAH MOPANE LOTS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS THREE DIFFERENT CAMPS IN USEFUL WE GOT SHOWN CAMP SIX WHICH IS WHERE THEY ARE THERE ARE PRISONERS WHO RECENTLY HAVE ALWAYS OBEYED THE RULES THEY HAVEN'T NEEDED FORCE FEEDING FOR EXAMPLE AND AARON MORE COMELY COMMUNAL AREAS AND THERE ARE
THIS MYSTERIOUS CAMP SEVEN WHICH NONE OF US I GOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO TO WHICH IS WHERE
A SMALL NUMBER OF PRISONERS WELL FIFTEEN PRISONERS THAT AMERICA WILL NEVER SEE RELEASED AND HER BEING HOUSE AND IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS GOING TO CLOSE AND TIME SOON EVEN CONSTRUCTION WORK WAS GOING ON WILL BE MAINTENANCE CONSTRUCTION WORK AND IT'S STILL GOING ON TODAY AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND PLACES TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE DETAINED AT GUANTANAMO BAY BUT BECAUSE THE FEELING MIGHT BE CHANGING ABOUT ITS PURPOSE AND ITS USEFULNESS
WELL CERTAINLY THERE THERE HAS BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OBSTACLES TO A CLOSING ALREADY UP UNTIL THIS POINT A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY REPUBLICANS BUT SOME DEMOCRATS AS WELL SAYING WE CAN'T BRING THESE REMAINING PEOPLE ONTO THE AMERICAN MAINLAND BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE OF A CLAMOUR IF YOU LIKE TO GIVE THEM THEIR RIGHTS AND IF THERE ISN'T THE EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE PRESENTED A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IT'S NOW BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED AND TORTURED
THEN THERE MIGHT BE MORE OF A CLIMBER'S I'VE MORE OF THEM RELEASED SOME OF WHOM AMERICAN EVER WANTS TO RELEASE BUT IT'S INTERESTING OUT I SPOKE INTO REPUBLICANS WHO WERE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO CLOSING GUANTANAMO
THOSE KIND OF GROUNDS WHO ARE NOW SAYING
THAT IT SHOULD REMAIN OPEN SOAKED FUTURE ENEMY COMBATANTS WHO ARE WHO ARE PICKED UP CAN BE HOUSED THERE AS WELL INCLUDING ISLAMIC STATE REFERRED
YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP SAY ALL KINDS OF THINGS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF COURSE WHEN IT COMES TO GWENT HONOUR ONLY WENT ON A GREY BUT HE SAID HE WANTS TO FILL THE PLACE WITH BAD DEEDS BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS CATCHING ON ARE WE HEARING MORE AND MORE REPUBLICANS SAY THAT COUNTRY AND HE MABLE THANK YOU IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY THE RETAIL SECTOR IS STRUGGLING HE'S IN DESPERATE DESPERATE TROUBLE AND PRICES ARE ROCKETING THROUGH THE ROOF
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT WELL IT IS IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE BRACKETS WOMEN CLOSE BRACKETS WHO BUYS CLOTHES AND THEN RETURNS THEM ON THE INTERNET WITH THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE BUY CLOTHES IN THE FIRST PLACE GOOD MORNING TO YOU THEY SEARCH BY RADIO FOUR'S YOU AND YOURS PROGRAMME SAYS THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF WOMENSWEAR BOUGHT ONLINE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS WAS RETURNED
AND IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CLOTHES BOUGHT ONLINE OR SENT BACK ACCORDING TO BARCLAYCARD ONE IN FIVE ONLINE BUSINESSES HAVE INCREASED PRICES TO COVER THE COST OF MANAGING AND PROCESSING CUSTOMER RETURNS FROM LEEDS I'M JOINED NOW BY THE REPORT'S RESEARCHER KATHRYN SHUTTLEWORTH FROM SAVVY RETAIL AGENCY GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT'S GOING WRONG HERE WHY ARE WE SENDING SO MUCH STUFF BACK
I WAS FOR SENDING STUFF BACK WE'RE ALSO KEEPING QUITE A LOT OF STUFF SO THE ONLINE SHOPPING MARK IS GROWN BY ABOUT TEN PER CENT ON A YEAR AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE BUY CLOTHES PARTICULARLY FEMALE CLOTHES AND PARTICULARLY YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS THEY TEND TO ORDER MORE THAN THEY NEED AND THEN DECEMBER AT WHAT WE DON'T WANT SO WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS FROM THIS RESEARCH WE TALK TO A LOT OF SHOPPERS AND THEY'VE SAID AS WELL I ORDER TWO OR THREE THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE OF SIZING
WHICH IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE ONLINE I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE ITEMS GOING TO LOOK LIKE THEY THEN CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO KEEP AND SEND THE REST BUT THIS IS THE TRUTH ISN'T IT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPEAKING AS A WOMAN IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAUGE WHAT THE TEXTILE FABRIC IS LIKE AND ALSO WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE RIGHT SIZE AND ALSO WHAT COLOUR IT IS SO WHAT CAN RETAILERS DO BETTER TO REDUCE THAT FIGURE
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK THAT MOST WOMEN YOU WOULD TALK TO WOULD SAY THAT WHAT RETAILERS CAN DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SIZING IS FAIRLY STANDARDISED AND MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY DO DO PHOTOGRAPHS ONLINE BUT THEY LOOK AS CLEAR MESSAGING IS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE BUT THE OTHER GREAT THING ABOUT ONLINE AS IT OPENS UP A WHOLE WORLDWIDE MARKET PLACE TO A SHOPPERS AND IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA TRY THINGS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE EVERYTHING
THAT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING FOR RETAILERS BECAUSE WHILST PEOPLE ARE SELLING A LOT OF THINGS BACK AS A SAY THEY ARE RETAINING A LOT OF ITEMS AS WELL BUT IT'S COSTLY WHEN THEY SEND IT BACK ISN'T IT AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ITEMS THAT DO GET RETURN BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE EXCEPT HE'S NOT FOR THE SHOPPER IS IT BECAUSE MOST OF US LIVE IN THE END IT IS SURELY WE LIKE FREE DELIVERIES AND WE LIKE FREE RETURNS AND I THINK HE SAID THAT SOME RETAILERS HAVE INCREASED THEIR PRICES NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE IT IS STILL A COMPETITIVE MARKET
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALL THESE ITEMS ARE RETURNED AS THEY GO BACK THROUGH REVERSE LOGISTICS BUSINESS THE CALDER EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS THEIR BUSINESSES THAT COLLECTS ALL OF THESE ITEMS AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FIT FOR RE SELLING MOST OF THE RETAILERS ARE VERY CLEAR RETURNS POLICY SO IF YOU DO RETURN SOMETHING IT'S GOT TO BE WITHIN A SPECIFIC SET TIME OF NUMBER OF DAYS AND ALSO STUFF'S GOT TO BE FIT TO RESELL
BUT THESE BUSINESSES ARE GROWING ENORMOUSLY AND MOST SHOPPERS DON'T REALISE THEY EXIST ONCE FIGURE I WAS FIND ASTONISHING IS ACTUALLY HOW LITTLE WE STILL TO UNBIND THIS IS A REVOLUTION RIGHTED IT'S BEGINNING ISN'T IT IT IS AND WE TALK THE SHOP SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY WILL DO MORE BUT NINETY SIX PERCENT OF US HAVE SHOPPED ONLINE IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS WHICH I THINK IS IS A PHENOMENAL FIGURE AND IS ONLY SET TO GROW
CATHERINE SHUTTLEWORTH FROM SURREY RETAILER AGENCY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW NOT UNRELATED A WEE FAST HEADING TOWARDS A CASHLESS SOCIETY IN THE U.K. CONTACTLESS CARD TRANSACTIONS HAVE RISEN BY A THIRD IN THE PAST YEAR AND A MASTERCARD SURVEY SHOWS A QUARTER OF US INTEND TO MAKE PAYMENTS WITH A PHONE OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO RELY ON CASH HERE'S SUSANNA STREET
PETER'S GOING TO BROTHERS IT IS A VERY GOOD SEX WITH THE MERCEDES BLAST OF WET I'LL TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL
SO YOU THROW OUT THE SHERRY UNDERNEATH MY LAD THE DARING OF DYNAMO MIKE DRAWS A BIG CROWD IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE JUGGLING MACHETES AND CHAINSAWS WELL ON A THREE METRE HIGH UNICYCLE IS NO MEAN FEAT IN THE WE'RE PETER STANDING NOW
WITH MY HAT OFF TO YOU BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE WILL BE TODAY'S CROWD FOR YOUR TIPS HE'S USUALLY REWARDED BY A CLINK OF COINS AND A FLURRY OF NOTES BUT INCREASINGLY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE ARE SAYING THEY'RE OUT OF CASH THE TRENT IS WHY MIKE HE'S A BIG ADVOCATE OF THE NEW ACT OF THE BUS
SOME OF US USING A PAPER ADVERTISED IN THE MONTH SIGNS TO SHOW US ONE OF MY BEST BUDDIES IS USING HOW MUCH HOW DO YOU DO THEY TOUCH US TOO AS I FOUND WITH THE BUS SKABB DOES THE RESOURCES TOGETHER
BUT IF YOU WERE GONNA MINISTRIES ACROSS MY CAMERA IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO MAKE A PROFILE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT THE ARTISTS GOING TO FOLD THEM IN AND OUT OF FINDING WHERE THE WORKING AND
IN THE CASE MUSICAL BUSKERS ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO BUY NOW YOU LOOKED ON LINE WHICH IS
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE VENDORS WHO SELL MAGAZINES TO HELP PAY THE RENT OR I THOUGHT A NIGHT IN A HOSTEL ALSO OFTEN HAVE A LOYAL CUSTOMER BASE BUT THE LACK OF LOOSE CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS IS ALREADY BEING FELT I MET STEVEN ROBERTS AND THE C.E.O. AT THE BIG ISSUE FOUNDATION ON A LONDON STREET HAD A BIG ISSUE WE ARE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS VEIN
ON THE ONE HAND WE'RE TALKING TO TECH PROVIDERS AND ON THE OTHER WE'RE TALKING TO MAINSTREAM
WE HOPE TO BRING THE TWO TOGETHER TO FIND IT EASY TO YOU
MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR US IN THE BEGINNING
TO GIVE ALL ABOUT THEN THERE'S ACCESS TO A MAINSTREAM BANK ACCOUNT WITH THE REST OF US
THE CONGREGATION AT THE HOPE COMMUNITY CHURCH IN BRISTOL HAVE ALREADY MADE THE LEAP INTO DIGITAL PAYMENTS THE PASTA CHRIS BOND TOLD ME STANDING ORDERS HAVE BEEN POPULAR NOW THEY'RE TRYING SOMETHING NEW
AND IN A PAPER A BUTTON TO A WEBSITE SO THAT'S MAKING A LITTLE BIT EASIER RATHER THAN HAVING TO SEND YOUR BANK DETAILS THOUGHT HER THE ACCOUNT NUMBER TWO TO THE CHURCH OF THE PEOPLE
YOU CAN JUST LOOK ON THE WEBSITE AND INTO A TRANSACTION ONLINE THAT MEANS I THINK WE'RE QUITE GEARED UP TO
IF YOU'VE GOT SIMPLY FINANCIALLY AND IT'S QUICK AND EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD NICE AUDIT TRAIL UNCOUNTABLE OH
AS CHURCHES LEAVE THE COLLECTION PLATE BEHIND THE RATTLE OF THE COLLECTION TIN IS GETTING QUIETER
THAT A CONTACTLESS DOG IT'S ONE SOLUTION FOR THE PET CHARITY BLUE CROSS HE WEARS A SPECIAL COPE WITH AN INTEGRATED CARD READER WHICH WENT TACT WITH A DEBIT CARD TAKES CONTACTLESS PAYMENT
IT MAY SEEM LIKE A GIMMICK RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE APPROACHING THE TIPPING POINT WHEN CASH WILL NO LONGER BE KING I WAS DRIVEN
MANY ORGANISATIONS RELIANT ON SPONTANEOUS GIVING ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO ADAPT OR MY LEFT BEHIND DON'T HAVE ANYBODY
IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY I WOULD LIKE SOME SUSANNAH STREET ARE REPORTING THERE NOW THAT'S THE SPENDING SIDE OF THINGS WHAT ABOUT SAVING A NEW REPORT SAYS THAT ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THOSE AGED BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY FOUR ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY SAVING ENOUGH FOR THEIR FUTURE DAVID WHITTAKER IS THE MANAGING ECONOMIST AT THE CENTRE FOR ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS AT THE THINK TANK THAT DID THE RESEARCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL US WHAT DOES IT TELL US THAT WE ARE OVER WORRIED ABOUT SAVING OR NOT WORRIED ENOUGH
IT'S SUNNY TELLS US THAT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE CONFIDENCE OVER THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR SAVINGS WE'VE SEEN THOSE AGE FIFTY FIVE AND EVA ARE TWICE AS CONFIDENT ABOUT THEIR SAVINGS AND THEIR FUTURE THAN THOSE IN YOUNGER AGE GROUPS OBVIOUSLY NOWADAYS WE HAVE TO SAVE MORE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LIVING LONGER SO IS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE SORT OF COPPING ONTO THE REALITY
I THINK THERE IS GROWING REALISATION THAT THE U.K. AGES AND PEOPLE LIVING LONGER AND HAVING TO POSSIBLY WORK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAVE MORE AS WELL AND THAT THEY MAY NOT BE SAVING ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT WE OFTEN HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR SAVINGS RATIO OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S SAVINGS RATIO WHAT IS THAT AND DOES IT TELL US ANYTHING SIMPLY THE RATIO OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAVING RELATIVE TO DISPOSAL INCOME SO IT'S NICE TO BE AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN FIFTY YEARS SO WHAT IF I TELL HER
THAT'S THAT TELLS US AT THE MOMENT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT OF ULTRA LOW INTEREST RATES AND STAGNANT WAGES THAT PEOPLE MAY FIND THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TO SAY OH THEY FEEL THEY DON'T AND THE FACT THAT IT'S LOW IT ACROSS OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL NOT JUST THE U.K. MEANS IT'S NOT JUST A PHENOMENON THAT'S LOCATED HERE WHAT WE WILL FIND OVER TIME IS THAT IF THIS THIS RATIO STATES PARTICULARLY
THAT PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THEIR SAVING IT FOR THEIR RETIREMENT AND PEOPLE SHOULD ACTUALLY START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF RETIREMENT THEY WANT NOW AND TRY TO ADJUST THEIR SAVINGS ACCORDINGLY YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S DOUBLY DIFFICULT OF PEOPLE CAN'T GET ONTO THE PROPERTY LADDER OH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THIS REPORT HAS FOUND THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE HOME FROM ABOUT NINETEEN SIXTY THREE ONWARDS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE HAD IN THEIR INCOME RELATIVE TO THE HOUSE PRICE HAS GONE UP IT WAS ABOUT THREE TIMES BETWEEN SORT OF THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AROUND NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND AS OF LAST YEAR IT'S NOW CLIMBED TO FOUR AND A HALF DOWN TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE PRICE IS NOW FOUR AND A HALF TIMES WHAT THEY'RE SORT OF AVERAGE INCOME IT'S AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO GO UP BASED ON A PROJECT WHAT WOULD NEED TO CHANGE NOW IN ORDER FOR US TO FEEL MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT WAS OPEN
I THINK THAT SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED WILL HELP DO THAT WE SUPPORT THAT MANX VIEW WHO WE CONDUCTED THIS REPORT WITH THAT SOME OF THE POLICIES I'VE BEEN OUT SUCH AS A HELP TO SAVE THE HELP TO BUY ICE AND THE LIFETIME AS A WELCOMED AND SHOULD ACTUALLY POSSIBLY BE DEVELOPED AND MADE MORE GENEROUS DEBBIE WHITAKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT THE MARKETS OF COURSE BUT NOT THE STOCK MARKET IS CLOSED TODAY BUT JUSTIN URQUHART STEWART IS NOT CLOSED
HE'S WITH US IN THE STREET WHO CAN HE'S ALIVE AND WELL AND WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO IT'S TALKING ABOUT SAVINGS JACOB ROTHSCHILD THE INVESTMENT TRUST
HE'S LOOKING TO BUY ALLIANCE TRUST WHAT'S THE BACK STORY HERE THIS WILL BE A FIVE BILLION POUND DEAL BUT IT'S INTERESTING IN TERMS OF THE SAVINGS INDUSTRY ISN'T IT IT IS FASCINATING COS THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES ONE POINT TO DAVID'S MAKING THERE WE DON'T EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT SAVING SO PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO TRY AND DO A LANCE TRUST IS ONE OF THOSE OLD ORGANISATIONS OLD INVESTMENT TRUST IS BACK TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHICH WAS ALL BASED AROUND PEOPLE SAVING FOR THE LONGER TERM RELATIVE QUITE SMALL THUMBS
AND THOSE INVESTMENT TRUSTS LOOK AROUND IN THE BACKGROUND DON'T GET MUCH COVERAGE OF THE COMPANIES LIKE A LANCE TRUST CALEDONIAN THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN SLOWLY BAD DEVELOPING NOW ALLOWED TRUST HAS BEEN TRYING TO GROW BUT A LOT OF THESE OUT THE COMPANIES HAVE ASSETS WHICH VALUED BELOW THEIR SHARE PRICE OF THE VALLEY BELOW THE ACTUAL VALUE THE COMPANY ITSELF A DISCOUNT IN THEIR CASE THAT DISCOUNT GOT AS LOW AS ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT GOT TO TWELVE PER CENT AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE IT UP SO THAT IT'S CLOSER TO THE VALUE OF THE ACTUAL ASSET
THIS IS WHERE ROTHSCHILD COMING ROSS CHILD HAVE BEEN SEE IF THEY CAN TRY AND HELP ALLOWED TO DO THIS COS ACTUALLY THEY'RE ABOUT THE SHARE PRICE WHICH ALSO HAS AN INVESTMENT TRUST IS ACTUALLY AT A PREMIUM SO IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WILL BUY IT BUT LANCE TRUST HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM AN AGGRESSIVE SHAREHOLDER WHO'VE BEEN GOING IN THERE TRYING TO STIR THINGS UP WHO WILL ELLIOT ADVISOR AND UNITED STATES SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A FINANCIAL SOAP OPERA ALMOST IN DUNDEE THREE HUNDRED JOBS OF CONCERN UP THERE AND SO ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN WILL MEAN THAT YOU TRY AND PROTECT THOSE JOBS

LAST WEEK SEVENTEEN ALBANIANS UNDER BRITISH MAN WANTED FOR MURDER WERE DETAINED WHEN A CATAMARAN ARRIVED AT CHICHESTER MARINA IN WEST SUSSEX SOME OBSERVERS HAVE RAISED DOUBTS ABOUT BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO PATROL ITS COASTS
THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR OF SYRIA'S MAIN OPPOSITION GROUPING HAS RESIGNED OVER WHAT HE SAYS IS THE FAILURE OF PEACE TALKS DESIGNED TO END THE FIVE YEAR CONFLICT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE B. B. C. MUHAMMAD ALI LOUCHE SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENEVA TALKS WHILE THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WERE BEING BOMBED AND BESIEGED HE SAID THAT UNLESS CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND IMPROVED IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATIONS
A WOMAN IS MISSING AFTER BEING SNATCHED BY A CROCODILE IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA SHE WAS SWIMMING WITH A FRIEND IN QUEENSLAND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE ANIMAL STRUCK A SIXTEEN FOOT CROCODILE HAS BEEN SEEN IN THE AREA IN RECENT WEEKS
DONALD TRUMP HER SAID ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN TREATED BETTER THAN U.S. MILITARY VETERANS THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MADE THE CLAIM WERE ADDRESSING A HUGE MOTORCYCLE RALLY FOR VETERANS IN WASHINGTON D. C. HE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE TO BACK UP HIS ALLEGATIONS

THOSE TWENTY ODD BEING HELD IN DOVER STILL BEING QUESTIONED AMONGST THE EIGHTEEN ALBANIANS BELIEVED TO BE TWO CHILDREN AND ONE WOMAN WE DON'T TO MORE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THIS OPERATION YES SAY THE FIRST IS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THOSE IMAGES HAVE AN INFLATABLE BOAT ON THE BEACH BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY BORDER FORCE THAT WASN'T THE BOAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE RESCUE SO THAT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ACTUALLY
TWO BOATS INVOLVED IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE A PEOPLE SMUGGLING OPERATION NOW WE ALSO HEARD LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON FROM THE HOME OFFICE THAT TO COASTGUARD CUTTERS AS THEY CALL THEM TO COASTGUARD SHIPS WERE ALSO ON THE SCENE OVER THE WEEKEND IN ADDITION TO TWO LIFEBOATS AND A SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER SO IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY THAT
TWO CUTTERS WERE THERE AT DYMCHURCH WHEN THIS INSTANT WAS HAPPENING TO ME RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN SOME SORT OF ANTI PEOPLE SMUGGLING OPERATION BUT HOW WELL IS IS IS THE COASTLINE POLICED THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF BOATS THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING THIS SORT OF THING THAT'S RIGHT QUESTIONS ARE CERTAINLY BEING ASKED ABOUT IT WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FIVE CUTTERS SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY ARE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN HELPING IN THE OPERATION THERE
THERE WAS AN OFFICIAL REPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SAID TWO OF THEM WERE MOTHBALLED CERTAINLY AT ONE STAGE LAST YEAR THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPERATIONAL CUTTER TO PATROL THE ENTIRE BRITISH COASTLINE WHICH SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY GIVEN THE LENGTH OF IT AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL FROM FROM CALAIS LARGELY NOT BY BOAT BUT THERE'S THERE'S A PROBLEM
AND THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE AWARE OF THAT PROBLEM THEY ACTUALLY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE LAST WEEK BEFORE THE DYMCHURCH INSTANT AND THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO BE NEW PATROL VESSELS PUT IN THE WATER THEY SENT THE FIRST BATCH OF THOSE VESSELS WILL BE OPERATIONAL WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
THEY SAID ALL OF THEM WOULD BE OPERATIONAL BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR AND THEY ALSO SAY THEY'VE BEEFED UP THE POWERS OF THE BORDER FORCE SO THAT FROM TOMORROW IN FACT THEY CAN BOARD AND DETAIN ANYONE WHO IS SUSPECTED OF PEOPLE SMUGGLING SO THE GOVERNMENT WILL SAY IT IS ON THE CASE WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK ANTI MORE THANK YOU
TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS ARE IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PROVE TO A PAROLE BOARD THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER A RISK
THEY'RE SERVING WHAT'S CALLED AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE IT'S CALLED A. P. P. STANDS FOR IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO WAS ORDERED TO REVIEW OUR REPORTERS VERY CONWAY IS HERE JUST GIVE US AN IDEA ZOE WHAT AN I. P. P. IS
THEY WERE INTRODUCED BY THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND THE THINKING WAS THAT YOU WOULD KEEP VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN PRISON UNTIL THEY'D PROVEN THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC SO THEY MIGHT GET A SIX MONTH SENTENCE BUT THAT THAT'D MEAN THEY'D BE OUT AT SIX MONTHS EXACTLY SO YOU THEY WOULD BE GIVEN A MINIMUM SENTENCE LET'S SAY OF SIX MONTHS
THE THINKING WAS IT WOULD AFFECT NINE HUNDRED OFFENDERS BUT IT WAS APPLIED FAR MORE WIDELY AT ITS PEAK THERE WERE SIX THOUSAND PRISONERS ON I.P. PEAS NOW THERE ARE STILL EVEN THOUGH THE SENTENCE HAS BEEN ABOLISHED BY THE WAY THERE ARE STILL FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN PRISON OR DIE P. SENTENCES AND THE VAST MAJORITY ARE WAY OVER THAT MINIMUM THEY'VE ALREADY SERVED THE MINIMUM THEY'RE SORT OF TRAPPED IF YOU LIKE
FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM HAVE SERVED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO ONE OF THEM THAT'S RIGHT HIS NAME IS JAMES WARD AND HE GOT A TEN MONTH I.P. PIECE SO A TEN MONTH MINIMUM SENTENCE FOR ARSON IN TWO THOUSAND SIX NEARLY TEN YEARS LATER HE SOON PRISON HE DOESN'T HAVE A RELEASE DATE
THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD NOW HE WAS IN AND OUT OF TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS FATHER IT ENDED IN HIM BEING CONVICTED FOR ASSAULT FOR AVIATION BEING SENT TO PRISON NOW CLOSE TO THE END OF THAT PRISON SENTENCE HE WAS IN PRISON FOR A YEAR
HE JUST COULDN'T COPE HE HAS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE HAS LOW I.Q. HE SET LIGHT TO THE MATTRESS IN HIS CELL FOR DOING THAT A JUDGE GAVE HIM A TEN MONTH I.P. PEE
AND AS I SAID HE'S STILL IN PRISON TEN YEARS LATER AS HIS SISTER EXPLAINS HE'S BEEN STRUGGLING TO COPE THROUGHOUT HIS SENTENCE
BECAUSE HIS RACE HE BURNED HIS PATIO OFF HIS BODY A COUPLE OF TIMES HE'S BURNT HIMSELF TO SEVERELY LASHING QUITTING HIMSELF
FIRES TWISELLS YEAH DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY IT WILL GET THE PHONE CALL THAT JIMMY HAS TOOK HIS OWN LIFE DEFINITELY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS JAMES HAS BEEN WRITING TO THE TODAY PROGRAMME AND HIS WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS
I GET MY MEDS FOR A.D.H.D. EVERY MORNING WHICH DO HELP ME THAT PRISON'S NOT FIT TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE'S MADE ME WORSE HOW CAN I CHANGE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING SCARED OF WHAT THE DAY MIGHT HOLD
JAMES ALSO HAS A LOW I.Q. AND HIS SOLICITOR SAYS HE STRUGGLES TO UNDERSTAND HIS SENTENCE WHY THERE ISN'T REALLY STATE AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS SHE SAYS WHY HE BECOMES OVERWHELMED AND DOES THINGS LIKE BARRICADED HIMSELF INTO HIS CELL AND WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM AS A TEMPLE TO BE TALKING TO THE FORMER JUSTICE SECRETARY KEN CLARKE THE MAN WHO ABOLISHED SENTENCES A FEW YEARS AGO
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GLOVES ARE OFF FOR CONSERVATIVES ANGRY AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S HANDLING OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WITH OPEN DISCUSSION OF A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE AFTER THE VOTE TODAY DAVID CAMERON WOULD BE CAMPAIGNING ALONGSIDE THE NEW LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON SIDIQUE KHAN A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN IS HERE AND THERE
POTENTIALLY OFF POSSIBLY HAVE AN EASIER PLACE FOR HIM TO BE GIVEN THE RHETORIC FROM SOME OF HIS OWN SIDE YEAH BIZARRELY THIS IS ANOTHER OF THIS ARE VERY UNUSUAL ALLIANCES THAT THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS FORGING SIDIQUE KHAN THE NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON ALONGSIDE DAVID CAMERON ON THE PLATFORM AND REMEMBER WHEN SIDIQUE KHAN WAS DURING THE CAMPAIGN
FOR THE MAYORAL ELECTION THERE WAS A REALLY BITTER ROW WHICH THE PRIME MINISTER GOT IMPS GOT GOT INVOLVED IN HIMSELF AT THE DESPATCH BOX THAT PROMISED US QUESTIONS ACCUSING MISTER KHAN OF HAVING SHARED PLATFORMS WITH EXTREMISTS IN THE PAST THAT STRATEGY CLEARLY FAILED TO CUT THROUGH IN THAT
SILICON WAS ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON WHAT THE PAIR ARE DOING LATER IS TO HIGHLIGHTS WHAT THEY'RE CALLING A GUARANTEED CARD IT'S ONE OF THESE PLEDGE CARDS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HANDING OUT RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY THERE REMAIN SIDE WITH FIVE WHAT THEY CALL FIVE GUARANTEES OF WHAT E.U. MEMBERSHIP WILL CONTINUE TO BRING THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WORKERS RIGHT TO PROTECT I THINK WHAT'S STRIKING ACTUALLY ABOUT THE GUARANTEES IS THAT AT LEAST TWO OF THEM ARE VERY CLEARLY THOSE PARTS OF
THE CAMPAIGN THAT THE LABOUR SIDE HAS BEEN TRYING TO PROMOTE SO WORKERS' RIGHTS AND LIVING STANDARDS AND I THINK THERE IS A REAL SENSE NOW WITHIN THE REMAINS LIKE THEY'VE GOT TO TRY AND CUT THREE TO THOSE LABOUR VOTERS WHO REALLY COULD BE CRUCIAL TO A VICTORY FOR THEM MEANS VOTE LEAVE THE SAME THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER VOTE PERMANENT FREE MOVEMENT AND AGAIN THEY'RE PUSHING THIS LINE THAT IT WOULD ALLOW TURKEY TOO
JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION ON ON THE THE POINT ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S OWN DIFFICULTIES FROM FOR A PARTICULAR LOOK OR BIG LOOKING AT WHAT ANDREW BRIDGE IN A DEAN DORIS SAID OVER THE WEEKEND AND CRITICISM FROM BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GAVE HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS BUILDING HERE AND HAS IT GONE BEYOND WHAT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE HOPED FOR AND IN TERMS OF THE TONE OF THIS I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE I MEAN I THINK WHAT WAS
POTENTIALLY MORE DIFFICULT MORE DAMAGING YESTERDAY WAS ACTUALLY WHAT BORIS JOHNSON MICHAEL GAVE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S PLEDGED TO CUT IMMIGRATION BEING CORROSIVE OF PUBLIC TRUST ME THAT WAS REALLY QUITE A DIRECT ATTACK AND ALSO PRETTY PATEL ATTACKING THE LIFESTYLES OF WHAT SHE CALLED THE LEADERS OF THE MAIN CAMPAIGNER CLEARLY INTENDED
BE DIRECTED TOWARDS GEORGE OSBORNE AND DAVID CAMERON I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF NADINE DORIS AND ANDREW BRIDGE IN THESE ARE THE USUAL SUSPECTS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A HUGE SURPRISE THAT THEY'RE ATTACKING THE PRIME MINISTER AS BACKBENCHERS BUT I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE ONE IS THAT WE'VE SEEN EARLIER IN THE CAMPAIGN IT'S REALLY HARD FOR DOWNING STREET TO FIGHT ON MORE THAN ONE FRONT AT THE SAME TIME WE SAW THIS AFTER THE RESIGNATION OF
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AND THEN OVER PROMISED HIS TAX AFFAIRS AFTER THE PANAMA PAPERS THAT HAVING THE REFERENDUM ERIN TRYING TO FIGHT WITH YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS COMING FROM THE SIDELINES IS REALLY QUITE TRICKY BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT THE DEAN DORIS POINT RAISES
SHE'S CLEARLY PUTTING IT OUT THERE PUBLICLY THAT ARE A THIN MARGIN VICTORY FOR THE REMAIN SITE IS NOT ENOUGH AND THEY WERE YOU SHE SAID A SIXTY FORTY WIN FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO BE ON SAFE GRAB DOWNING STREET SAYS ALL A DISTRACTION ALL INTENDED TO TAKE ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS FOR STAYING IN THE TUB OPEN THANK YOU
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND ATTEMPTS BY MIGRANTS TO REACH OF THIS COUNTRY BY BOAT AT THE LEAD STORY IN THE MAIL AND THE EXPRESS BOTH FOLLOWING UP THE STORY IN THE SUNDAY TIMES YESTERDAY
THE MAIL SAYS THE CONTROL OF BRITAIN'S COASTLINE IS A FIASCO EXPRESSES THE HORROR OF PEOPLE DYING AS THEY CROSS THE MED IS LIKELY TO BE REPEATED IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TRAFFICKERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING SMALL AND SUITABLE BATTLES ON THE NOTORIOUSLY TREACHEROUS STRETCH OF SEA THE MIRROR SAYS THE BOOK MUST BE THROWN OUT OR PEOPLE SMUGGLERS TRYING TO SNEAK MIGRANTS INTO BRITAIN BY BOAT OR THE FLOODGATES WILL OPEN
AND LIVES WILL BE LOST BRITAIN SEAS OF THE NEW FRONTLINE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANISED CRIME THAT'S WHAT THE SUN SAYS THE GOVERNMENT MUST BE FOR POLICING OF U.K. WATERS THE E.U. IS ABOUT TO ISSUE THE BIGGEST CARTEL FINE IN ITS HISTORY REPORTS THE FINANCIAL TIMES PUNISHING EUROPE'S LARGEST LAURIE MANUFACTURERS ON CHARGES OF FIXING PRICES AND DELAYING THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES THE COMPANIES SAY THEY'RE CO OPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION ALTHOUGH ONE SAID IT MIGHT APPEAL AGAINST ANY NEGATIVE DECISION
THE PAPER SAYS THE FINES COULD TOTAL MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION POUNDS AND TWO FIRMS OR DISCUSS LENIENCY WITH THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE FIND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNING BODY OF DAVID CAMERON'S OLD SCHOOL IS THREATENING TO RESIGN FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE PROVOST OF ETON HE SAYS HE CANNOT ACCEPT THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO MAKE EMPLOYERS ASK JOB APPLICANTS WHETHER THEY ATTENDED AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL
IS PART OF DAVID CAMERON'S LIFE CHANCES AGENDA WHICH HE SAYS WILL SPREAD ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY TO POORER CHILDREN BUT WHO SERVED IN MARGARET THATCHER AND JOHN MAJOR'S GOVERNMENT SAYS JOBS SHOULD BE GIVEN ON MERIT REGARDLESS OF BACKGROUND
IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG TO PUNISH CHILDREN FOR THEIR DECISIONS TAKEN BY THEIR PARENTS AND THE DAILY MIRROR AND THE TIMES HAVE DRAMATIC PICTURES ON THEIR FRONT PAGES OF YESTERDAY'S ENCOUNTER BETWEEN A THIRTY STONE GORILLA AND HER FOUR YEAR OLD BOY WHO FELL INTO HIS ENCLOSURE AT CINCINNATI ZOO THE MIRROR TALKS OF A TERRIFYING TEN MINUTE ORDEAL BEFORE THE ENDANGERED APE WAS SHOT SPARKING FURY AMONG ANIMAL LOVERS THE PAPER SAYS EXPERTS HAVE DEFENDED THE ZOO'S DECISION ARGUING THE GORILLA COULD HAVE BEEN IT COULD HAVE KILLED THE CHILD WITH ONE SWIPE

MAIN INTERESTS OF DRONES HERE THAT YOU'VE GOT THE DEAL
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GROUND AND YOU'RE ABLE TO BRINGS THIS VIDEO
A BIT SO THE PILOTS OF THE DRAWN BUT AS SOON AS A GRAND FRANCIE'S ELEMENT TO GROUND CAYMAN
INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE SHARE REALLY UNDERLINES THE COUNTRY'S CRUCIAL ROLE AS A KEY PARTNER FOR THEM
ONE MAJOR AREA OF CONCERN IS THE BOCA HER RUM INSURGENCY IN NIGERIA AND VIOLENCE THERE WAS SPILLED ACROSS THE BOARD
THE WORST AFFECTED AREA IS TUDORS DRIVE FROM HERE IN THE SOUTH EASTERN REGION OF DEEFER WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED
I DID I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT LOOK AT THE CAR DRIVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY THIS IS AN AREA OF RELATIVE SAFETY RELATIVE
REMAINS A THREAD WHICH EXPLAINS WHY AS WERE DRIVING ALONG WITH THAT SHE GOT IT

FOR THOSE FORCED TO FLEE ENDING THE THREAT POSED BY BOCA HER ARM CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH NIGER CAN'T TACKLE THE MILITANTS ON IT
THE GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT A JOINT REGIONAL MILITARY PUSH WILL HELP PREVENT BOOKER HURRAH FROM GAINING A FOOTHOLD ON ITS SOIL
HAS SOON ME MUST SOLD HIS SHARES DEFENCE MINISTER SOMEONE GOING TO FILM SOMEONE WE'RE SOON GOING TO LAUNCH A MASSIVE INTERVENTION AGAINST BOOK OR WE ARE GOING TO BREAK THEIR SPINE WE ARE KIP ABLE OF TAKING ON THE ENEMY FROM BOTH SIDES FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE FINAL BATTLE
JULIAN KEANE REPORTING FROM NIGER THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN A MOTORCYCLIST HAS BEEN KILLED IN A CRASH IN THE RUN UP TO THE ISLE OF MAN T.T. RACE SAID TO BE ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS MOTORSPORT EVENTS IT'S BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND IN THAT TIME NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY RIDERS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE MAIN EVENT YESTERDAY DEAN MARTIN WHO WAS FIFTY EIGHT WAS KILLED WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE COMMENTATOR AND FORMER T.T. RIDER STEVE PARRISH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND DEAN MARTIN'S DEATH THEY CAME IN
DURING A PRACTICE SESSION AHEAD OF THE MAIN RACE YES IT DID IT ACTUALLY WASN'T ON THE T.T. COURSE THEY HAVE A APPRIS T.T. RACE MEETING OVER HERE CALLED THE THE PRE T. TAKE CLASSICS AND IT'S NOW RUN RUN ON THE BILL OUT ON THE CIRCUIT WHICH IS MUCH MUCH SHORTER THAN THE T.T. COURSE IT'S FOUR POINT TWO FIVE MILES AS OPPOSED TO THIRTY SEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES ROUND OF THE T.T. COURSE IT'S A CLASSIC EVENT AND LOTS OF RIDERS AND PEOPLE TAKE IN
AND UNFORTUNATELY DEAN MARTIN CAME OFF HIS BIKE BICKLE CLYDEY WITH ANOTHER BUY AND LOST HIS LIFE AND IT HAD A VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OBVIOUSLY NOT NICE TO START THE FORTNIGHT HERE AT THE T.T. BUT WHY IS THE T.T. SO DANGEROUS IS IT ABOUT THE SPEEDS AT WHICH THE RIDERS RACE OR IS IT THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE COURSE ARGUABLY THE TOPOGRAPHY IS ON A ROAD COURSE WHICH
A LOT OF GRAND PRIX IS FOR INSTANCE ARE ON MAN MADE CIRCUITS HAVE BIG RUN OFF AREAS BUT THE THRILL AND THE EXCITEMENT AND THE MY GUESS THE SATISFACTION YOU GET FROM RIDING ON THE T.T. COURSE IT IS THE ULTIMATE IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN MOTORCYCLING YOU COULD SAY IT'S THE EVEREST OF BIKES AND IT'S ON A COURSE THAT HAS VILLAGES TREES WALLS MOUNTAINS HUMPBACK BRIDGES YOU NAME IT IT'S ALL ON THE COURSE ARE THE DANGER IS PART OF THE ATTRACTION
VERY MUCH SO I THINK IN MY LIFE THE DANGER IS WHAT GIVES ME GOOD WHO'S GIVE ME ALL THE THRILLS ON THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN HOW DANGEROUS AND HOW MUCH EXCITEMENT THRILL IT GIVES YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MADE SAFE FURTHER AND I'M A MODICUM PER SAFE SAFER FOR THE SPECTATORS AS AS WELL AS FOR THOSE TAKING PART AND THIS IS HAPPENING IT'S EVOLVING EVERY YEAR IT GETS SAFER IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S MORE AIR SINCE HE'S PUT OUT AND PADDING AROUND THE COURSE
SPECTATORS ARE RESTRICTED TO MORE AREAS THAN I EVER USED TO BE MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING LEATHERS AIRBAGS THAT THEY RIDE THEIR HELMETS EVERYTHING IS GETTING STATES A YEAR BY YEAR AS I GUESS LIFE DOES BUT YOU CAN NEVER MAKE THE T.T. COURSE I SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS A VERY HIGH SPEED COURSE AROUND AROUND AND IRELAND ON IT HAS SOLID OBJECTS THAT YOU CAN HEAR SPEEDERS NEVER KILLED ANYONE IT'S STOPPING QUICKLY KILLS YOUR I'M AFRAID
SO WHEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU WERE TAKING PART IN IT YOURSELF YOU ALWAYS YOU PRESUME YOU WEIGHED UP ALL OF THIS BUT YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THESE WERE A RISK WORTH TAKING YEAH YOU CAME OVER ON THE FERRY TO GET HERE YOU KNEW THE RISKS THAT YOU WERE TAKING HER I GUESS UNFORTUNATELY YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS DID
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO NOT DO SOMETHING THAT IS AN ULTIMATE CHALLENGE AND IT HAPPENS WITH A GUESS BASE JUMPING MOUNTAIN CLIMBING YOU NAME IT IT'S OUT THERE AND HE IS HARD TO DESCRIBE TO SOME THEY CALL IT A DRUG AND IT IS REALLY ADRENALIN DRUG AGUS YOU GET GOING IT'S HUGELY EXCITING A MASSIVELY SATISFYING WHEN YOU'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING
STEVE PARRISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN H.I.V. MAY NO LONGER ATTRACT THE SAME SORT OF ATTENTION IT ONCE DID IN THIS COUNTRY MY LIVERPOOL AS PART OF THE WORLD ESPECIALLY SUB SAHARAN AFRICA STILL A SERIOUS THREAT THERE IS A NEW WAY OF DIAGNOSING IT THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED BY SCIENTISTS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR HELEN LEE HAS LED THIS PROJECT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOING AND THIS IS THE
PIECE OF KIT THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A COFFEE MACHINE IT'S CALLED SAMBA YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHY IT'S A DIAGNOSTIC KIT YES THE REASON IS COS THE ENGINEER WHO DO YOU LIKE DANCING
AND SO HE WANTED A COLLEGE SAMBA SO THE SHAKES AND BAKES THAN RUGS WE ADOPTED THE NAME AND WE LIKE IT RIGHT AND WHAT DOES IT DO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW QUICKLY DOES IT DO IT WELL IT LOOKS FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE VIRUS ITSELF IN A DROP OF BLOOD SO IT'S A BIT LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
AND SAW WE CHEMICALLY HAVE A PROBE THERE SPECIFICALLY LOCATE THE NEEDLE MULTIPLY BILLIONS OF TIMES THEN VISUALISE THE SIGNALS SO THAT TWO LINES IT'S POSITIVE WHEN LINE IS NEGATIVE NO LINE YOU DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT AND THE KIDDIES HE'D STABLE SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE REFRIGERATION
AND IT CAN BE I ALWAYS SAID BY ANYONE WHO CAN COOK WHICH LEAVES HALF OF THEIR MEN OUT TO VERY SEXIST COMEDY RIGHT ON AND IT WORKS WITHIN A SPIT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE THAT JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AND WAVE TAKES NINETEEN MINUTES FOR ONE PARTICULAR TEST AND UP TO TWO HOURS BY A SECOND TEST
THE POINT IS THAT THIS CAN BE DONE WHEN THE PATIENTS THEY'RE STILL ON SIDE SO THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL ACTION CAN BE TAKEN OUR RIGHT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE BLOOD SEND THE PERSON AWAY AND THEN SIX WEEKS LATER YOU'RE YOU'RE POSITIVE EXACTLY ALTEN THERE DID LES
BECAUSE HE HAS WHAT IS CALLED THE LAST OF OUR LOT WHICH DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY CAN BE FROM THIRTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT SO YOU MAY AS WELL NOT HAVE DONE THE TEST ABSOLUTELY AND HAVING DONE THE TEST AND OBVIOUSLY THAT IS A MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH DO THAT IS THEIR ACCESS TO THE RIGHT SORT OF DRUGS IN THOSE VERY POOR COUNTRIES TO HELP THE PERSON I THINK EXCESS TO DIAGNOSTIC
DRUGS IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE IN MANY COUNTRIES BUT THERE ARE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS YOU AND HE'D TAKE THE GROVE AND CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS THAT DO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR THAT TEST AND FOR THE TREATMENT
RIGHT SO ENSURED A LOT OF LIVES ARE GOING TO BE SAVED OF AT LEAST A LOT OF LIVES ARE GOING TO MASSIVELY IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF THIS I HOPE SO BUT I THINK I NEED TO SAY THAT THIS PROUD IS THAT THE TEAM DEVELOPED THIS TEST WHICH REALLY TOOK OVER A DECADE
IT IS STILL JUST AT ALL IN THE WHOLE CHAIN OF IVAN'S UNLESS IT IS EFFECTIVELY LINKED WITH APPROPRIATE TREATMENT THEN IT IS STILL NOT BEING A A WE'RE NOW STILL YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE EFFECT THAT THAT IS HIS INTENDED WELL AS YOU SAY THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE STEP FORWARD PROFESSOR HELEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD A HUGE MOTORCYCLE RALLY THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN BETTER TREATED THAN U.S. MILITARY VETERANS THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS SPEAKING AT THE ANNUAL ROLLING THUNDER EVENT WHICH HONOURS FORMER SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN FROM WASHINGTON D.C. ARE NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL REPORTS
A MILLION BIKERS FROM ALL OVER THE U.S. CONVERGED ON WASHINGTON TO TAKE PART IN THE ANNUAL PARADE TO REMEMBER YOU S. SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE TAKEN PRISONER OF WAR OR WENT MISSING IN ACTION

OUR VETERANS HAVE BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THE CROWD AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL CHEERED ENTHUSIASTICALLY THOUGH SOME WE SPOKE TO WERE RATHER NUANCED IN THEIR SUPPORT FOR HIM IF YOU LIKE
HE'S A LESSER OF ALL THE EVILS WHAT ABOUT HILARY WHAT D'YOU THINK OF HER SHE'S TRASH SHE WAS IN PRISON

BECAUSE IT'S HILLARY CLINTON YOU'RE GONNA VOTE FOR DULL JOB THIS WASN'T DONALD TRUMP PANDERING TO A SMALL MINORITY THE VETERANS AND BIKER VOTE IS SIGNIFICANT IN U.S. POLITICS AND IT'S A GROUP HE'S DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS OWN

SCIENTISTS IN AUSTRALIA SO MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE CORAL IN PARTS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY MASS BLEACHING THERE'D HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF BLEACHING INCIDENTS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BUT THE RESEARCHERS SAY THE DAMAGE CAUSED THIS YEAR IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN ANYTHING SEEN BEFORE FROM SYDNEY JOHN DONNA
A STUDY CARRIED OUT BY JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY FOUNDED IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF CORAL WAS EITHER DEAD OR DYING THE RESEARCH TEAM DESCRIBED IT AS THE MOST EXTREME CASE OF MASS BLEACHING THEY'D EVER MEASURED AT THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE
CORAL BLEACHING HAS BEEN LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT HAPPENS WHEN WARMER WATER CAUSES FOR CORAL TO WEAKEN AND LOSE THEIR COLOURFUL ALGAE THAT PROVIDE OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS
THIS LATEST RESEARCH WILL INCREASE CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TO CATEGORISE THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AS IN DANGER SOMETHING IT WAS SO FAR HELD BACK FROM DOING

THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN SHOULD THE NEAR SINKING OF A BOAT CARRYING ALBANIAN MIGRANTS OFF THE KENT COAST TO SERVE AS A WAKE UP CALL ABOUT THE USE OF THE CHANNEL AS A ROUTE FOR ILLEGAL MIGRATION THERE TWENTY PEOPLE RESCUED FROM THE BOAT THAT GOT INTO DIFFICULTY NEAR DYMCHURCH AND NOW BEING QUESTIONED TWO CHILDREN ARE THOUGHT TO BE AMONG THE EIGHTEEN ALBANIAN CITIZENS WE'RE JOINED NOW BY JOHN VINE WHO WAS UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU BUY THIS
I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REPORTS IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT THE LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE OF INSTANT AND IN FACT WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK THE RELATIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE BOATS INFORMED THE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR LOVED ONES SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOW LOOK AT THIS VERY SERIOUSLY
IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REPORTS NOT LEAST IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR FROM MY SUCCESS WAS A CHIEF INSPECTOR BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION WHO SAID THERE WAS NO EFFECTIVE STRATEGY ON THE PART OF BORDER FORCE TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH WHAT'S CALLED THE GENERAL MARITIME THREAT HER GENTLE MARITIME IS THE TERM USED FOR THE SMALL PORTS
AROUND THE U.K. AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT TO BORDER CONTROL OUT THEM AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOSE SMALL PORTS YES THERE ARE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SMALL PORES ARE THERE FOR A LOT OF SMALL AIRPORTS AS WELL SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR BORDER FORCE TO DEPLOY EFFECTIVELY TO THEM THEY CAN'T BE THERE ALL THE TIME CLEARLY BUT THEY DO NEED SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND A PLAN TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF THREAT AND WHEN YOU SAY SUFFICIENT RESOURCES WHAT DO WE NEED BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THAT THAT
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE BORDER FORCE CUTTERS IN ALL TWO OF WHICH ARE MOTHBALLED ONE OF WHICH IS APPARENTLY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN YES THERE ARE FIVE ER SMALL COASTGUARD CUTTERS AND THEY USED BY BORDER FORCE TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE BORDER CONTROLS AT THESE PORTS AND ALSO TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WE'RE REFERRING BACK TO THE MOST RECENT REPORT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE'S NOT A GREAT DEAL OF PRESENCE OF PORTS WHEN
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR LOOKED AT WHETHER THEY BORDER FORCE OFFICIALS WERE KNOWN TO HARBOUR AUTHORITIES AND USES A SMALL HARBOURS THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THAT WAS THE CASE AND IN FACT TWO OF THE COASTGUARD CUTTERS HAVE BEEN MOTHBALLED I THINK TO SAVE MONEY SO WHAT WOULD SUFFICIENT RESOURCES LOOK LIKE WHAT WOULD REALLY BE NEEDED TO TACKLE THIS WELL
I THINK THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE PUBLISHED A REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SAID THAT THE FRANCE OF THE FRENCH SHELL ANTIC COAST HAD TWENTY TIMES THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE U.K. TO DO TO PATROL THE COASTLINE I HAVE THE EQUIVALENT COASTLINE
AND SO THAT DOES NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE RESOURCES THE EXTENT TO WHICH I THINK NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF INTELLIGENCE ON THE BASIS OF THE BORDER FORCE WORKING WITH OTHER ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THE POLICE THE COASTGUARD AGENCY AND OF COURSE HAVING GOOD LIAISON WITH HARBOUR MASTER'S AROUND THE U.K. AND YOU YOU YOU YOU POINTED OUT THAT WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS INCIDENT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ON BOARD GOT INTO DIFFICULTY AND THEY CALL THEIR RELATIVES WHO THEN ALERTED THE AUTHORITIES DO YOU THINK THAT THESE SORTS OF INCIDENTS
HAVE BEEN GOING ON THEREFORE FOR SOME TIME WITH SOME PEOPLE MANAGING TO TO REACH THEM THE BRITISH COAST OR IS THIS A NEW PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON FERRIES AND LORRIES I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN THAT THIS SORT OF THING THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING THE TROUBLE WITH THIS SORT OF THING IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF IT WE ONLY KNOW WHAT'S REPORTED OR WHAT BORDER FORCE FIND IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY WE DO KNOW IS THAT IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASING NUMBER
OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS FOUND IN CONTAINERS ON BOARD LORRIES THAT HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BECAUSE OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY PORTS LIKE DOVER
BUT WE NEVER KNOW HOW MANY HAVE NOT BEEN DETECTED SO I THINK IN THAT CONTACTS IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS FOUND IN THE CONTEXT OF SMALL PORTS OF COURSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THIS
BUT I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AND HERE IS IF THIS IS NOW THE START OF A NEW TREND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO BE GATHERING THE INTELLIGENCE ON THE RESOURCES TO NIP IT IN THE BUD WAS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WARNED THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN OFFICE YES I REPORTED ON THIS TWO INSPECTIONS WON IN TWO THOUSAND LEVEL WANTED TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WHICH WERE FOLLOWED UP AT THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE ANITA BUT IN THE WAY THAT YOUR REPORTS WERE RECEIVED WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS HE WHAT WAS YOUR SENSE OF OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AWARENESS OR WILLINGNESS TO ACT ON THE BASIS OF WHAT YOU SAID WELL MY SENSE WAS THIS WASN'T A MAJOR PRIORITY THAT THIS WAS A LOWER PRIORITY IN THE FACE OF OTHER DEMANDS ELSEWHERE NOW
THAT'S ENTIRELY REASONABLE IF AN ORGANISATION AS LIMITED RESOURCES IT HAS TO PRIORITISE WHERE ITS ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY IS BUT CLEARLY IF THIS IS NOW THE START OF SOMETHING NEW THEN REALLY THAT ASSESSMENT ABUSE OF PRIORITIES THAT NEEDS TO BE REASSESSED THE RESOURCES NEED TO BE PUT INTO A BEND THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH COAST GUARD SAYS THAT HIS BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT THE SAME KIND OF TRAGEDIES WE SEE IN GREECE OR ITALY WILL START TO BE REPEATED IN THE CHANNEL AS THAT
WELL CLEARLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY FOCUSES OF THE AUTHORITIES NEED TO BE ENSURING THAT PEOPLE DON'T LOSE THEIR LIVES AND ARE CLEARLY WE'VE SEEN THAT AT THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN I'M NOT I'M NOT A NAUTICAL PERSON BUT I WOULD'VE THOUGHT CROSSING THE CHANNEL
WITH ALL THE HAZARDS IN TERMS OF CROSS CHANNEL TRAFFIC AS WELL AS THE WEATHER AND THE SEA CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO MEAN THAT THERE'S AN EQUAL CHANCE OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIVES UNLESS THE SORT OF THING HE'S STOPPED JOHN FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
QUARTER PAST SEVEN IT'S FOUR YEARS SINCE THE GOVERNMENT PASSED A LAW TO STOP JUDGES IMPOSING INDETERMINATE SENTENCES IN OTHER WORDS SENTENCING SOMEONE TO JAIL FOR A MINIMUM TIME PUTTING NO MAXIMUM LIMIT ON IT BUT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL IN JAIL
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROVE TO PATROL PAROLE BOARD THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER AT RISK THE PRISON REFORM DRESS SAYS THAT IS WRONG JULIET LION IS ITS DIRECTOR GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND IT WAS WRONG BECAUSE WHAT
IT'S WRONG BECAUSE IT'S UNJUST TO LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR WHAT THEY POSSIBLY MIGHT DO IN THE FUTURE RATHER THAN WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST IT'S WRONG BECAUSE KEN CLARKE WHEN HE WAS JUST HIS SECRETARY ABOLISH THE SENTENCE
BECAUSE OF THAT INJUSTICE IT IT'S WRONG BECAUSE THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION SAY THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO MANAGING PEOPLE IN A SENTENCE STILL SERVING AND IN FACT ABOLISHED SENTENCE WHICH DOESN'T HAVE ANY LEGITIMACY ANY LONGER BUT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO LET SOMEBODY OUT OF JAIL IF THEY'VE THEN WENT OFF AND MURDERED SOMEBODY
WELL IT WOULD BE WRONG TO LET SOMEBODY OUT OF JAIL WITHOUT THEIR SUPPORT AND SUPERVISION THEY WOULD NEED PARTICULARLY AFTER THEY'VE BEEN HELD IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION FOR SO MANY YEARS SO IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO HAVE THE PROBATION SERVICE MAKING ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN HE HAD PROPER RELEASE PLANS FOR PEOPLE I GUESS IT WOULD BE RIGHT CERTAINLY TO MAKE SURE THE PAROLE BOARD HAD ENOUGH RESOURCES
TO GET PAST ITS BACKLOG ACTUALLY SEE THESE PEOPLE CONSIDER THEIR CASES YOU KNOW WE'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY HAVING A CASE BY CASE REVIEW OF THE THE FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT I'M STRANDED ON THE SENTENCE THE JOB
WELL IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE IN EVERY SENSE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THESE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF UNCERTAINTY AND HER MENTAL HEALTH
SUICIDE SELF HARM RISK IT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE FAMILIES WHO ARE WORRIED SICK ON THE OUTSIDE BUT IT IS ALSO COSTING TAXPAYERS IT'S COSTS ABOUT WE THINK FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SO FAR AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION PER YEAR OR TWO IN ORDER TO KEEP ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHEN PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T BE KEPT WELL THAT'S RIGHT BUT OF COURSE THAT IS THAT WOULD PERHAPS ISN'T IT
WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE A SENTENCE THAT SO UNCERTAIN YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN ABOLISH IT IT JUST WASN'T ABOLISHED RETROSPECTIVELY SO THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT STRANDED NOW IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DANGEROUS WITHIN THAT GROUP AND THERE MAY WELL BE THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ADEQUATE SUPERVISION IN THE COMMUNITY PROPER
SUPPORT POSSIBLY TAGGING FOR PUBLIC REASSURANCE BUT SOME WAY OF MOVING THEM FORWARD YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST START PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT AS KAFKA ESQUE AM I I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY OF DESCRIBING IT BUT THEY CAN'T GO TO THE PAROLE BOARD CAN'T THEY
THEY DO GO TO THE PAROLE BOARD THEY DO BUT THEY MAY WAIT A YEAR TWO YEARS IF THEY GET TO THE PAROLE BOARD IN THE DOSSIER HASN'T BEEN COMPLETED PROPERLY WHEN THERE ISN'T A POST RELEASE PLAN OR THEY MAYBE WERE IN A PRISON WHERE THEY COULDN'T DO A COURSE THEY WERE EXPECTED TO DO THEN THEY'LL BE KNOCKED BACK AND THEY'RE NOT PAT MIGHT MEAN ANOTHER TWO YEAR WAIT
SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ROUGH I DON'T WHETHER THE WORD IS REHABILITATED OR PERHAPS THEY WERE NEVER THAT SERIOUS A DANGER IN THE FIRST PLACE WHO CAN SAY BUT WHO SHOULD NOT IN MANY MANY CASES YOU BELIEVE BE IN PRISON AT ALL
THEY CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T BE NOW BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM AT THE TIME THAT SENTENCE WAS PASSED MAYBE THE SENTENCE WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOU HOPE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS A JUST AND RIGHT SENTENCE BUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE STILL THERE AND THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE RELEASED AND THEY'RE LIVING WITH THAT UNCERTAINTY
CAN'T BE RIGHT AND IT MUST BE DEALT WITH WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY WHO'S PROMISED TO REVIEW MUST TAKE ACTION AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE JUSTICE COMMITTEE SHOULD MAKE AN INQUIRY NOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN FRANCE WILL GO ALL THE WAY TO GUARANTEEING A BIG MULTINATIONALS PAY THEIR TAXES SO SAYS THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER HOW EASY WILL THAT BE IN PRACTICE THEY TANYA BECKETT HAS THEM ALL FOR US WELL I THINK IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME IT'S THE ANSWER OR THE SHORT ANSWER AT LEAST MICHELLE MICHELLE SEPALS YOU SAID THAT SAID THAT MORE CASES WOULD FOLLOW AFTER GOOGLE AND MACDONALDS WERE TARGETED BY TAX RAIDS GOOGLE LAST WEEK
HE RULED OUT NEGOTIATING ANY DEAL WITH GOOGLE ON BACK TAXES OF COURSE BRITAIN DID EXACTLY THAT IN JANUARY I'M JOINED NOW BY JOHN COLOUR NAME WHO IS TAX POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE OF TAX GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO THE FRENCH ARE SAYING THEY'LL PURSUE IT THROUGH THE COURTS WHERE THE U.K. DECIDED TO CUT A DEAL WHY
WELL YOU CAN SEE REVENUE OUR OFFICIAL LITIGATION STRATEGY WHICH SAYS THEY DO NOT DO DEALS THEY ONLY COME TO AGREEMENTS WHERE THE AGREEMENT IS WHAT THEY THINK FAIRLY REFLECTS WHAT IS LIKELY TO COME OUT OF A COURT PROCESS
SO ACCEPTING THERE CAN BE SOME UNCERTAINTY THEY WON'T DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A COSY DEAL THE FRENCH ALL KIND OF IN EFFECT SAYING WE THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY DID AS A KIND OF US ASIDE
THEY ALSO HAVE AN ELECTION NEXT YEAR IN FRANCE WELL THAT IS TRUE SO THERE'S SO IT FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW IT MAY BE APPEALING TO THE OF THE FRENCH MINISTER IF THEIR BATTLE LINES DRAWN WITH THE U.S. MULTINATIONALS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AHEAD DOES IT MATTER THAT THERE'S NOT A CONSISTENT APPROACH WITHIN THE E.U. OVER THERE
UM NOT NECESSARILY I THINK WHAT IT WHAT MATTERS MOST OF ALL IS THAT THE ER THE LAWS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES SHOULD BE CONSISTENT
SO THERE A KIND OF HOLES OPENED UP FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPLOITATION A LOT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE O.E.C.D. IN THE RECENT PAST TO KIND OF TRY AND GET THE LAW'S PIECED TOGETHER THEY'RE VIRTUALLY THE ONLY THING THESE BUSINESSES HAVE IN COMMON ONE WOULD'VE THOUGHT GOOGLE APPLE MACDONALD IS THAT THEY ARE LARGE INTERNATIONAL U.S. BASED FIRMS BUT THE TYPE OF BUSINESS IS THE RUNNING ARE ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFERENT SO HOW IS IT THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE ALL MANAGED TO GET INTO THIS SITUATION OF DISPUTE WHAT'S THE UNDERLYING LOOPHOLE
I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES FOR DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT ONES WITH GOOGLE IT WAS ALL ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLEARLY THE VALUE OF GOOGLE IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITH FAST FOOD MCDONNELL'S FROM WHAT YOU CAN PICK UP IN THE PRESS THE ISSUE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT NO HELL SO THE FRENCH COMPANY IS PAYING A LUXEMBOURG COMPANY FOR THE RIGHT TO USE THE KNOW HOW AND OBVIOUSLY AS THE KNOWHOW WAS PREDOMINANTLY DEVELOPED IN THE STATES
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SOLD INTO LUXEMBOURG AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST BUT IF YOU BIT ANYBODY LISTENING TO THIS MIGHT SAY BUT ACCOUNTS ARE ACCOUNTS SURELY THIS MUST BE REGISTERED SOMEWHERE AS TO HOW MUCH IS BEING PAID FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR NO HOWELL OR WHATEVER ASPECT WHICH IS WHICH IS THE NON TANGIBLE ASPECT OF THIS SO WHY IS THERE NOT A WHY IS THERE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN
THE ACCOUNTS THAT COMPANY'S FILE AND WHAT THEY PRESENT TO THE TAX OFFICE WELL THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS CHOOSE TO MAKE DISCREPANCIES AND I THINK IN GENERAL THE FEAR DISCREPANCIES THEY MADE OUT THAT HE CAN'T BE PERFECTLY ALIGNED BUT THE BETTER IT WOULD BE BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH SAYING BUT DONALD'S TOUPEE GLOBALLY A GREAT DEAL MORE TAX EVEN THE GOOGLE DO THEY PAY ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT
IT'S ABOUT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF U.S. TAX ON THEIR U.S. PROFITS AND ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT GLOBALLY SO THEY PAY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TAX JOHN COME ON IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU TURN THE OTHER TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE WOMAN WHO WAS SUSPENDED FROM THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE OF COMMENT SHE MADE ABOUT ISRAEL HAS BEEN REINSTATED SHE'S JACKIE WALKER A PROMINENT SUPPORTER OF JEREMY CORBIN AND SHE IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU HI DID YOU EXPECT TO BE REINSTATED GIVEN THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD SET YES OF COURSE
SO DO YOU ACCEPT NO OR DO YOU HAVE ANY APOLOGY TO MAKE LET'S PUT IT LIKE THAT FOR THOSE THINGS YOU SAID LIKE I DON'T HAVE AN APOLOGY TO MAKE YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M SADDENED IF I'VE UPSET PEOPLE
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN WE'RE TALKING IN POLITICAL SPEECH WE UPSET PEOPLE AND THESE ISSUES ARE VERY UPSETTING YOU KNOW THE ISSUE'S ABOUT
MIGRATION AND REFUGEES AND OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOLOCAUST SNOT JUST THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST BUT THE AFRICAN HOLOCAUST ON THE OTHER GENOCIDES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BUT WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN ESSENCE SURELY WAS DIMINISHING
THE HOLOCAUST YOU WROTE ON FACEBOOK TO ONE OF YOUR CORRESPONDENTS ON FACEBOOK AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW MILLIONS MORE AFRICANS WERE KILLED IN THE AFRICAN HOLOCAUST AND THEIR OPPRESSION OPPRESSION CONTINUES TO GO ON A SCALE THE GLOBAL SCALE IN A WAY IT DOESN'T FOR JEWS SO IN OTHER WORDS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE
SURELY HE'S ACTUALLY LET'S GET OVER THE HOLOCAUST IT HAPPENED LIVE WITH IT
OH MY GOODNESS NO I'M SAYING THE OPPOSITE ALL I'M SAYING IS EVERY SINGLE DEATH OF EVERY PERSON NO MATTER WHAT THEIR RACE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR CULTURE IS AN AWFUL THING
NO ONE GENOCIDE NO ONE HOLOCAUST IS IN MY OPINION WORSE THAN ANY OTHER I'M AN INTERNATIONALIST THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN INTERNATIONALIST
AND I THINK EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN PARTICULAR HISTORY AND EACH GENOCIDE HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR HISTORY BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS
ANY OF THE HISTORY OF OUR ANCESTORS BEING USED IF YOU LIKE TO AUTHENTICATE
HUMAN RIGHTS INFRINGEMENTS NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT BUT YOU DON'T GET IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT POINT YOU DON'T HAVE TO INVOKE THE HOLOCAUST DO YOU YOU SAY MANY JEWS MY ANCESTORS TOO
WITH THE CHIEF FINANCIERS OF THE SUGAR AND SLAVE TRADE WHICH IS OF COURSE WHY THERE WERE SO MANY EARLY SYNAGOGUES IN THE CARIBBEAN SO WHO ARE VICTIMS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN
CLEAR IMPRESSION TO MANY PEOPLE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANTED YOU TO BE SUSPENDED IS THAT YOU WERE SAYING THE JEWS HAD IT COMING ALMOST OH GOD WHAT AN AWFUL THING TO SAY NOBODY HAS THAT KIND OF THING COMING LESS SHOCKING THING TO SAY
CAN I JUST SAY ON THIS THE CONTEXT OF THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CAN I JUST REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THIS WAS IN A PRIVATE FACEBOOK POST THAT WAS BUT DOESN'T MATTER CAN I CAN I JUST FINISH I'M SORRY BUT CAN I FINISH THIS
THE CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT I WAS TALKING TO TWO FRIENDS ONE OF WHOM IS AN ISRAELI ZIONIST ONE OF WHOM IS THE PERSON WHO WITH MY FRIEND HE'S THE ISRAELI STUDIED THE HOLOCAUST BOTH THE AFRICAN HOLOCAUST AND THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST WITH ME
AND WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY WAS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS AN ETHICAL ARGUMENT AGAINST SANCTIONING
ISRAEL THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
SO THERE IS NOT THE POINT OF YOU KNOW WHETHER WHETHER THE JEWISH HOLOCAUST WAS NOT IMPORTANT IT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO WHAT'S HAPPENED IT WAS QUITE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE SLAVE TRADE BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND OF COURSE IT WAS DIFFERENT OF COURSE IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT IF I CAN JUST FINISH MY POINT
IT WAS ME AND MY COMRADES WHO WERE DOWN IN DOVER RESISTING THE FASCISTS THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLED HITLER WAS RIGHT
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT'S A WHOLE UP SWELL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SO ALARMED
BY WHAT THE JEWISH CHRONICLE HAVE REPORTED LET'S SEE THEM DOWN THERE IN SOLIDARITY WITH US FIGHTING THOSE FASCISTS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE LABOUR PARTY HAS A PROBLEM WITH ANTI SENATORS
I THINK THAT THE LABOUR PARTY IN SOME WAYS REFLECTS SOCIETY IN GENERAL IN FACT MY EXPERIENCE OF THE LABOUR PARTY OR SHALL I SAY THE LABOUR MOVEMENT TELLS ME THAT THE LABOUR MOVEMENT HAS MUCH TO BE PROUD OF IN ITS ANTI RACIST WE'RE COMING JUST COMPARE IT TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
IN THE TORY PARTY AND LET'S QUESTION WHY THE RACISM OF THE TORY PARTY THAT IS SO EASILY POINTED TO HE'S NOT COMING UNDER INSPECTION OR PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A FORMER CANDIDATE WHO WAS SUSPENDED AFTER TREATING
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT JEWS THEY'VE GOT BIG NOSES AND SUPPORT SPURS BELLOW WELL PERHAPS THAT'S WHY WELL THEY MIGHT NOT BUT YOU COULD QUESTION WHY BORIS JOHNSON WHO DESCRIBED BLACK PEOPLE AS PICCANINNIES WITH WATERMELON SMILES WASN'T SUSPENDED BECAUSE I KNOW IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE LABOUR PARTY HE WOULD'VE BEEN JACKIE WALKER
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ROB ON ITS HERE WITH THE SPORT THANKS MICHELLE HELLO AGAIN WELL ANDY MURRAY THROUGH TO THE FRENCH OPEN QUARTER FINALS IN A MATCH AGAINST HER RE SHAG GASKET AFTER DEFEATING JOHN IS TO IN STRAIGHT SETS SRI LANKA FIGHTING BACK AT CHESTER LE STREET AS WE ENTER THE FOURTH DAY AT THE SECOND TEST BUT ENGLAND STILL LEAD BY EIGHTY EIGHT ROUNDS WITH JUST FIVE MORE SHRUNKEN SECOND INNINGS WICKETS REMAINING TONY BELL YOU IS BRITAIN'S LATEST BOXING CHAMPION AFTER KNOCKING OUT IN LONGER MACABRE WIN THE THIRD ROUND OF THEIR CRUISERWEIGHT TITLE FIGHT AT GOODISON PARK
AND ENGLAND FLY HAVE GEORGE FOR BUDE AT TWICKENHAM AFTER MISSING SIX OUT OF SEVEN PENALTIES AS WALES WERE BEATEN TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN IN THEIR PRE SUMMER TOUR AS FRIENDLY BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON LEWIS HAMILTON'S FIRST WIN OF THIS FORMULA ONE SEASON ENDING A DROUGHT OF SOME SEVEN MONTHS WITHOUT ONE HE HELD OFF REBELS DANIELLE RICARDO WHO SAID HE'D BEEN QUOTE SCREWED BY A BUNGLE PITSTOP
AND WITH HER MEANWHILE HAD BEEN WAVED THROUGH BY MERCEDES TEAM MAKE NICO ROSBERG WHO HAD TEMPERATURE MALFUNCTIONS WITH HIS CAR SO HAMILTON HAS REDUCED ROSBERG CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD TO TWENTY FOUR POINTS WITH ACCORDING TO FORMER F. ONE DRIVER ALLAN MCNISH THE REAL POSSIBILITY NOW DEVELOPING SOME MOMENTUM FOR THE SEASON
WELL THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS A PERFECT DAY FOR LEWIS HAMILTON FIRST OF ALL HE WON THE GRAND PRIX WON THE MONACO GRAND PRIX IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS WEATHER IS STARTING WET AND THEN DRYING UP LATER ON AND HE TOOK CHARGE OF THE RACE AND ALSO GOT HIS CHAMPIONSHIP BACK INTO CONTENTION BECAUSE NICO ROSBERG CASE TEAMMATE WHO IS LEADING SIGNIFICANTLY UP UNTIL THEN ACTUALLY COULD ONLY FINISH SEVENTH
IDEALLY FOR A LEWIS HAMILTON HE TOOK AWAY THE BIG TROPHY BUT HE TOOK AWAY THE POINTS AND I THINK THIS'LL GIVE HIM A MOMENT'S ON ROB BECAUSE UNTIL THEN HE'D ONLY LEAD ONE LAP OF THIS COMPLETE GRAND PRIX SEASON YEAH HE'S GOT A GOOD POSITIVE FEELING AND I THINK GOING INTO THE REST OF THE SEASON THEN THE CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLES BACK ON YES I MEAN AS YOU WERE SUGGESTING ELLEN IT WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED DRIVE FROM HEALTH AND UNDER TESTING CONDITIONS OPPOSITE BOLSTERS THE ARGUMENT THAT IN TERMS OF PURE DRIVING TALENT WHEN HE IS THE BEST ON THE CIRCUIT
IN TERMS OF FEEL I THINK IT WOULD DO BEING THE IDEAL RACE FOR LEWIS HAMILTON BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A SENSITIVITY OR RAW SEAT OF THE PANTS FEEL AND THEN WHEN YOU ADD IN THE RAIN THAT HAPPENED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RACE THEY KNIT IT REQUIRES JUST ACT NATURAL SKILL AND HE'S GOT IT IN ABUNDANCE THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THERE'S ONE THING THAT REALLY DOES CONFUSE ME HOW CAN A TEAM IN THIS CASE RED BULL POSSIBLY FAILED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TYRES READY HER PETS FOR THERE
HEY ROB IT'S NOT ONLY YOU AND IT'S ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND IT'S ALSO INCLUDED RENTAL BECAUSE THERE WERE VARIOUS OPTIONS OF TYRES I FEEL TO THEM AND BE HEARD THERE ARE SETS OF TYRES AT THE BACK OF THE GARAGE ON ONE OF THEM WAS OUT THE BACK AND THAT MADE THE TEAM JUST WASN'T READY TO SEE DANIEL RICARDO COMING IN FROM THE LEAD AND HE WOULD HAVE WON THE STREETS LET'S MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT WON THE RACE
COMING TO THE END HE WAS JUST THERE WAS NO WHEELS ON HIS CAR IT WAS LIKE IT WAS UP ON BRICKS IT WAS ACTUALLY FRANKLY EMBARRASSING BUT SO THE HELD THEIR HANDS UP TO THAT AND DANIEL WAS ABSOLUTELY FIZZING BECAUSE FOR HIM THIS IS THE LAST TWO WEEKENDS ON THE TROT QUID HE COULD HAVE WON THE GRAND PRIX AND DIDN'T
AND FINALLY ALAN FOR ALL ITS QUIRKINESS THE DIFFICULTIES OF OVERTAKING THE LOCAL DISRUPTION YOU BELIEVE THE MONACO GRAND PRIX STILL DESERVES ITS HIGH STANDING DO YOU ON THE F. ONE CIRCUIT
THE FACT THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PACKED FULL THE SPECTATORS BECAUSE THE BOATS WERE BOBBING AROUND IN THE HARBOUR OR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD A FANTASTIC RACE AT THE END OF IT AND IT WAS JUST A BIT OF YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE BEING IN THE CASINO ON THERE'S A CASINO MONOCLE THERE IS NO QUESTION IT STILL WILL BE ON THE CALENDAR FOR MANY YEARS TO COME ALLAN MCNISH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

THE CAMPAIGN GROUP THE TAXPAYERS' ALLIANCE HAS DESCRIBED THE PLANT SUGAR TAX AS AN ARBITRARY BURDEN ON THE POOR WHICH SHOULD BE SCRAPPED THE ORGANISATION TESTED A NUMBER OF SWEET DRINKS AND FIND THAT SOME FROM COFFEE SHOPS HAD MORE SUGAR THAN COCA COLA BUT WOULDN'T BE TAXED THE TREASURY SAID THE SUGAR TAX WAS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN ITS EFFORTS TO TACKLE CHILDHOOD OBESITY
IT IS TO ACTUALLY MEET TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHT IF YOU MAKE A DONATION TO A CHARITY AFTER YOU'VE HAD A LETTER FROM THEM YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THAT MOST OF YOUR DONATION WILL HELP THAT CHARITY DO ITS JOB WE NOW KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THE CHARITY COMMISSIONERS FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES MOST OF THAT DONATION GOES TO THE COMPANY OFTEN AN AMERICAN COMPANY THAT SENT THE LETTERS AS MUCH AS THREE QUARTERS OF IT WELL I'M JOINED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE CHARITY COMMISSION DAVID HOLDSWORTH AND ALSO HERE IN THE STUDIO BY CAR WILDING WHOSE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY
ORGANISATIONS MORNING TWO BOWS DAVID HOLDSWORTH THIS ISN'T RIGHT IS IT
GOOD MORNING JOHN NO IT ISN'T RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY THE CHARITY COMMISSION IN THESE CASES TOOK ACTION AND INVESTIGATED THESE CASES AND ENGAGE WITH THE CHARITIES AND ENSURED THAT THERE WAS ACTION TAKEN PLACE TO PUT THIS RIGHT ACTION SUCH AS WE'VE REQUIRED A SERIES OF ACTIONS BY THE CHARITIES SUCH AS REDUCING THE COST OF FUNDRAISING
ENSURING THEY ARE MORE TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC AT THE DONOR'S ENSURING THAT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO DONATE OR NOT IS VERY CLEAR AND SHOWS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR DONATION WILL END UP WITH THE END BENEFICIARY OF THE CHARITY SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU GET A BEGGING LETTER FROM A CHARITY
OR INDEED READ SOME MATERIAL ABOUT THAT CHARITY FOR YOU MAYBE IT PUT OUT AN ADVERT OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE UP SHOULD THEY SAY INTO
WE HAVE SPEND X. AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU'RE X. PERCENTAGE OF DONATION ROOMS RAISING THOSE DONATIONS SHOULD THEY BE ABSOLUTELY EXPLICIT ABOUT IT
THEY SHOULD BE IS AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT FOR A SOLICITATION STATEMENT TO BE INCLUDED IN SUCH PUBLICITY AND MAILINGS SO THEY ABSOLUTELY MUST BE CLEAR ON WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE DONATION IS GOING TO THE END CAUSE AND YOU FOUND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SPECIFICALLY USING DIRECT MAIL AS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF FUND RAISING AND IN SOME CASES AS I'VE JUST SAID SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE MONEY THEY RAISE WENT TO THAT COMPANY ARE YOU IN A POSITION IN THE BAND
WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO PLANET AND REGULATION FOR FUNDRAISING IS A SELF REGULATED MATTER IT'S WHY THE NEW FUNDRAISING REGULATOR IS IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT WE CAN DO AS THE COMMISSION REGULATOR IS WHERE WE SEE ISSUES AROUND GOVERNANCE WHERE WE SEE ISSUES AROUND PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WE ARE VERY CLOSELY MONITORING THIS AND WE WILL INTERVENE CAR WORLD IN YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK IT'S RIGHT YES THESE CHARITIES WERE NOT WELL RUN BUT I DON'T THINK THE TYPICAL AND I THINK THAT'S A POINT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT THIS MORNING JOHN FROM WHAT WE CAN SEE AND WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS AT THE CHARGE COMMISSION HAVE THESE WEREN'T PARTICULARLY WELL GOVERNED AND SO ON AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHARITIES THAT FUNDRAISE TAKE FUNDRAISING EXTREMELY RESPONSIBLE AND DON'T SET OUT TO SPEND AS MUCH MONEY AS THESE CHARITIES DID ON FUND RAISING COSTS BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THOSE THAT DO WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT
I DO ACCEPT THAT ABSOLUTELY AND INDEED I WOULD ARGUE TO YOU THAT CHARITIES THEY LOOK AT THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR THEY RECOGNISE THAT THE PUBLIC WERE ANGRY AND IN SOME CASES QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR JUST BE CLEAR THERE WAS THAT ELDERLY LADY WHO KILLED HERSELF BECAUSE SHE HAD A HUGE NUMBER BEGGING LETTERS AT LEAST IT'S BELIEVE THAT'S WHY SHE DID IT WELL ACTUALLY SHE DIDN'T OR HERSELF BECAUSE HER MAYBE SHE DIDN'T BUT THAT WAS WHAT WAS REPORTED AT THE TIME
IT WAS AND AND CHARITIES HAVE LISTENED TO THE PUBLIC'S CONCERN AND AS DAVID JUST SAID THEN WE HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD WE'VE SET UP A NEW STRONGER FUNDRAISING REGULATOR THAT SCOTT STRONGER POWERS OF SANCTION AND SO ON WE'VE LISTENED AND I THINK WE'RE TAKING THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN SPECIFICALLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO STOP THIS SORT OF THING GOING ON
THE FUNDRAISING COMMUNITY HAS A CODE OF CONDUCT THAT IT SHOULD FOLLOW FOLLOWING IT DOES IT WELL THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A NEW FUNDRAISING REGULATED THAT'S TAKING OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE FUNDRAISING COMMUNITY THEMSELVES ARE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO OPERATE TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS SHOULD THERE BE A BAN ARE VERY CLEAR LIMIT RATHER THAN LET'S NOT USE THE WORD BAN LET'S USE THE WORD LIMIT SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT A CLEAR LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THE DONORS' MONEY
SHOULD BE SPENT IS ALLOWED TO BE SPENT ON RAISING THOSE DONATIONS NO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD ARGUE TO YOU THAT IN SOME CASES THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS WHY CHARITIES WOULD HAVE HIGH FUNDRAISING COSTS IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR YEAR AND THAT'S BECAUSE JUST LIKE ANY BUSINESS THAT'S MAKING AN INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN THAT GENERATES INCOME OVER A LONGER PERIOD
I WOULD OF COURSE BE CONCERNED IF CHARITIES HAD HIRERS HYPHEN RAISING COSTS SUCH AS THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO RATHER THAN A BAN WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS THAT CHARITY SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR FUND RAISING COSTS AND DONNA SHOULD ACTUALLY NOT BE AFRAID OF ASKING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
BUT THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IS NOT HOW LOW YOUR OVERHEAD OR YOUR FUND RAISING COSTS OR THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IS HOW BIG IS YOUR IMPACT AND THAT'S WHAT DONNA SHOULD BE ASKING ALL THE TIME VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE THAT WHAT ABOUT YOU DAVID ELLSWORTH DAVID HOLDSWORTH A LIMIT
AS AS KARL SAID I WOULD AGREE IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IT'S ABOUT ENSURING MAXIMUM IMPACT AND ENSURING THE PUBLIC IS WELL INFORMED SO IT CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO DONATE TO ENSURE ITS MONEY GOES TO THE BEST POSSIBLE CAUSE
SO MORE STEPS HAVE TO BE TAKEN CAN WE BE SURE COS WE DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH DO WE OR CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ABOUT HOW THE NEW BODY WILL OPERATE THE NEW REGULATOR THE BODY WILL OPERATE
THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE NEW REGULATOR IN ITS SET UP WE HAVE A PERSON SECONDED IN TO THE NEW REGULATOR TO HELP IT SET UP SO IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH MOVING ALONG AND IT IS ON TRACK TO GO LIVE OVER THIS SUMMER AND WE ARE WORKING WITH IT TO ENSURE THAT ITS IMPACT IS THERE FOR THE SECTOR DAVID HOLDSWORTH CAR WORLD IN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AT WHAT MANY OBSERVERS NOW REGARD AS OPEN WARFARE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FEATURES ON SEVERAL FRONT PAGES DAVID CAMERON'S HOPES OF BEING ABLE TO AVOID TERMINAL DAMAGE TO PARTY UNITY AFTER THE E.U.

ANOTHER WAS A LONG TERM CAMPAIGNER ON DRINK RELATED HEALTH CONCERNS ONE SCIENTIST WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PANELS WORKING HIS HEAD HAVE BEEN SHOCKED BY THE OUTCOME THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS THE PANEL WAS MADE UP OF PEOPLE CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THEIR EXPERTISE AND ABILITY AND ALL THEIR DETAILS IT SAYS WERE PUBLISHED AND IT'S LOST THE SPARK OF GENIUS PAST THE JUMP LEADS SAYS QUENTIN LETTS OF THE DAILY MAIL HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE NEW TOP GEAR WITH CHRIS EVANS AND MAP THE BLOG
PLOP SAYS THE SUN PARAPHRASING THE TWITTER ARTY BLOWING A COLLECTIVE GASKET ITS OWN VERDICT IS THAT THE SHOW A RETREAD THE IRON THE TIMES BOTH GIVE IT TWO STARS OUT OF FIVE BUT HE GETS A FALL FROM THE TELEGRAPH WAS IT FLOP GEAR ASKS THE DAILY MIRROR NOSE SAYS IT'S T.V. CRITIC IAN HYLAND IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A DISASTER HOPEFULLY JEREMY CLARKSON SULKY FANS CAN SWALLOW THEIR PRIDE AND TIME TO REALISE THAT THEY COULD BE A LOT FOR THEM TO APPRECIATE HERE SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN THE INVENTORS SARAH GUPPY TOOK OUT A PATENT FOR ERECTING BRIDGES WITHOUT ARCHES ALL STIRLING'S USING WHAT SHE CALLED ROSE OF PILES AND SUITABLE FRAMING HER IDEAS INFLUENCE BOTH THOMAS TELFORD AND HIS MEN I BRIDGE AND BRUNEL IN HIS CLIFTON SUSPENSION BRIDGE BUT ONLY NOW HAS SHE BEEN FORMALLY RECOGNISED IN THE NEW EDITION OF THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY AS INVENTOR AND SUSPENSION BRIDGE
DESIGNER WE'RE JOINED BY DEBORAH JAFFA YOU THE AUTHOR OF INGENIOUS WOMEN A BOOK ON INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES THAT FEATURED SARAH GUPPY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MUCH DO THE TELFORD AND BRUNEL
LOOK UM I THINK AT THAT PERIOD THE RUTHLESS PEOPLE INTO BRITISH DESIGN IT IT'S NOT TRUE TO SAY THAT SARAH GUPPY WAS THE INVENTOR OF THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE SUSPENSION BRIDGES HAD EXISTED FOR CENTURIES ACROSS GORGES
BUT WHAT DID HAPPEN WAS IN THE UNITED STATES AROUND EIGHTEEN OH FIVE SOMEBODY INVENTED A SUSPENSION BRIDGE WHERE THE WALKWAY WAS ABSOLUTELY FLAT
AND THAT THEN LED TO THIS WHOLE DEVELOPMENT TO SUSPENSION BRIDGES WHAT SARAH COPY DID IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN
SHE INVENTED A METHOD TO PUT DEEP PILING ON EITHER SIDE OF A RIVER BANK SO DEEP THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WASHED AWAY AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF
I THINK ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN SUSPENSION BRIDGES AND INDEED THOMAS TELFORD CAME TO HER AND ASK FOR HER PERMISSION TO USE HIS PATIENT IN HIS DESIGN FOR THE MENAI BRIDGE THAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THOSE ARE LOTS THAT THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND AT THE TIME TOLD FOOD NOW ALL THESE BRIDGE BUILDERS
I I I YES SHE WAS SHE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN IN SHE WAS FROM SARAH GUPPY WAS MARRIED TO SAMUEL GUPPY IN BRISTOL
VERY WELL KNOWN FAMILY VERY WEALTHY WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE PATENT IS THAT SHE TOOK IT OUT IN HER OWN NAME WHICH IS VERY VERY UNUSUAL BEFORE THE MARRIED WOMEN'S PROPERTY ACT UNTIL THEN A A EVERYTHING AMARIT MARRIED WOMAN OWNED IT WAS THE PROPERTY OF HER HUSBAND AND THIS THIS WAS THE FIRST OF FOUR PATIENTS THAT SHE TOOK OUT WHAT WERE THE OTHERS
THE OTHER WAS FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE WAS A MESSAGE OF IMPROVEMENTS TO TEA AND COFFEE BEANS WHICH I KNOW THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE GOES FROM
THE HUTUS HAVE A BRIDGE OF POTENTIAL BRITISH DESIGN TO TEA AND COFFEE WHICH ON THE TOP OF THE WATER IN THE URN YOU COULD BOIL AN EGG AND THEN THERE WAS A RACK ON THE TOP TO KEEP THE TOAST WARM
AND THEN DOES IT EVER MADE I'VE NO IDEA IF HE'S EVER MADE AND THEN BY EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE SHE'S NO WE WHEN ICE FROM THIS PATENT I WAS RIGHT THE FELT SORRY FOR HER COS IT'S A FOUR POSTER BED WHICH HAS GOT STEPS UP THE SIDE BUT INSIDE THE BED IS AN EXERCISE BAR UNTIL GYMNASIUM
AND THEN IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR SHE'S REMARRIED AND MY CUTE WHO IT TURNS OUT WAS MUCH MUCH YOUNGER THAN HER ABOUT THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER SO OBVIOUSLY THE EXERCISE BEPPE HE'S GOT OVER THAT
I HAD AND IT WAS VERY HOPEFUL TO HER AND SHE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR SHE'S GETTING BACK INTO THE YOU KNOW THE BIG THINGS IT WAS A METHOD OF CAULKING OF WATERPROOFING SHIPS SO CLEARLY HAD AN INCREDIBLE MIND INCREDIBLE IMAGINATION WHY DON'T WE KNOW HER BETTER KNOW HER NAME WELL I THINK I'M SOMEONE AS WRITING THE BOOK THAT PEOPLE SAY WOMEN HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
OUT OF HISTORY I DON'T THINK THEY'VE HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE AND THERE'S CLEARLY MUCH MORE TO FIND OUT ABOUT SARAH GUPPY AND IT'S TRUE THAT HER SON THOMAS GUPPY WAS INVESTOR IN BRUNEL'S GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY SO SHE'S PART
PART OF WHAT YOU KNOW OF BRICKS CALLED THE THE THE THE EVENT AS PARADISE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THAT WOMEN WERE PART OF THAT THEY WERE THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AND MOTHERS OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS OR WHY SHOULDN'T SHE SHE HERSELF AT ONE POINT SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT THE CREDIT FOR A CREDIT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WHEN SHE WROTE HIM A BRUNEL AND GAVE HER SOME ADVICE SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT THE CREDIT BECAUSE WOMEN MUST NOT BE BOASTFUL
THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE ATTITUDE AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW THEY WERE VERY MUCH PART OF IT ALL AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THAT ATTITUDE DOESN'T HELP IN THEM NEVER BEEN WRITTEN INTO THE HISTORY DEBORAH JACKIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
AND THEN WHATEVER BOASTFUL AS WIND OR SADDLE ACTUALLY DIDN'T
THE STEREO NOW TO STICK IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY ENDED A NEWCASTLE STUDIO THIS MORNING PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING DAVID GOOD MORNING CHARLIE
TOMORROW THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND AND WILD HISTORIANS CONTINUE TO DEBATE WHETHER IT WAS STALEMATE OR VICTORY COMMEMORATIONS RIGHTLY HIGHLIGHT THE COST OF WAR IN INDIVIDUAL LIVES
OVER EIGHT THOUSAND DIED AS ADMIRAL LORD WEST COMMENTED THEY SOULLESS DIDN'T DIE IN AN INSTANT THEY WERE ONCE TRAPPED BELOW DECKS TERRIBLE BURNS WAR IS HORRIBLE IT WAS A HORRIBLE DEATH ON BOTH SIDES AND WE MUST REMEMBER THAT
THEY INCLUDED SIXTEEN YEAR OLD JACK CORNWELL THE FORMER DELIVERY BOY FROM LEYTON WHO WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED IN THE FIRST SOUTH OVER THE BATTLE AND DUE TO HIS BRAVERY AT STAIN IT'S POST BECAME THE YOUNGEST RECIPIENT OF THE VICTORIA CROSS
WHILE JACK BECAME A NATIONAL HERO MANY OTHER VICTIMS ARE EASILY FORGOTTEN ROSS CALLED HOWARD'S NEW BOOK THE LOST TOMMY'S PRESENTS AN AMATEUR IT'S A PHOTOGRAPHIC ARCHIVE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT IN THE SAME WAR AT THE SOMME
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND THE SEVENTEEN MILLION WHO DIED IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR BUT THE HORRIFIC REALITIES ETCHED IN THE FACES OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS SOLDIERS AS NERVOUS SMILES ARE SLOWLY REPLACED BY DISMAY
SOMETIMES IN THE BIG POLITICAL AND MILITARY DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR NEED TACTICS AND WEAPONS OF WAR OFFER IT'S EASY TO FORGET THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE INDIVIDUAL STORIES POINT US BACK TO OUR HUMANITY
NEVER TEENAGER A CHUCKLE AND A GORILLA'S SURVIVE SHRAPNEL LODGED IN HIS FOREHAND AND WENT ON TO ALSO FIGHT IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THE BIBLE GIVEN TO HIM BY HIS GRANDMOTHER STAYED WITH HIM DURING ALL THIS TIME AND IT'S ANNOTATED ON VARIOUS DATES WITH SOMEWHAT SADLY STILL AT WAR
HE FALLS OPEN AT PSALM TWENTY THREE THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD
PERHAPS IN THE MIDST OF WHERE INDIVIDUAL CARRIAGE AND FEAR IS OFTEN SUBSUMED BY PROPAGANDA AND POLITICS ALISON COUNTED TO GUARD HIS LOVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IS CONSTANT DESPITE THE MESS OF THIS WORLD
AT THIS BELIEF OF CHRISTIANS WHILE PROVIDING COMFORT IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN OPIATE TO TOLERATE THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR OR INJUSTICE
GOD'S CONCERN FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS ENERGISED ETHICAL REFLECTION COMBAT AT THE KIND OF FANATICISM WHICH CLAIMS THAT WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE EVERYTHING IS JUSTIFIED AND LED TO POLITICAL REFORM
THE COMMEMORATION OF THE NAVAL BATTLE FOUGHT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO RIGHTLY REMEMBERS INDIVIDUAL STORIES
NOT ONLY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HISTORY BUT LEST WE FORGET THAT THE TERRIBLE COST OF WAR IS BORN IN THE STORIES OF REFUGEES THE INJURED AND THE DEAD WEATHER OFF THE COAST OF JUTLAND OR LIBYA OR IN THE CITY OF FULL LUCHA THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT
THE SCENE AT CINCINNATI ZOO ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AFTER A FOUR YEAR OLD BOY FELL INTO THE GORILLA ENCLOSURE WITHIN TEN MINUTES THE GORILLA HAD BEEN SHOT DEAD AFTER IT PICK THE CHILD UP AND BEGAN CARRYING HIM AWAY THE DIRECTOR OF THE ZOO THANE MAYNARD SAID THE DECISION TO SHOOT WAS THE RIGHT ONE
IT'S A SAD DAY ALL THE WAY AROUND THE RIGHT CHOICE WAS MADE IT WAS DIFFICULT CHOICE OH WE HAVE PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES WE DO DRILLS WITH A DANGEROUS ANIMAL RESPONSE TEAM
BUT WE NEVER HAD A SITUATION LIKE THIS AT THE CENTRE WHERE A DANGEROUS ANIMAL NEEDED TO BE DISPATCHED IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION
BUT THE TEAM DID A GOOD JOB IN THE MOOD TOUGH CHOICE AND THEY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE THAT ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY SOME THE PRIMATE SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN SAID IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THE GORILLA WOULD HAVE DONE ANY HARM WE'RE JOINED NOW BY KRISTAN POLAND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH AND IRISH ASSOCIATION OF ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS SHE HAS A P.H.D. AND GORILLA BEHAVIOUR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING FROM WHAT DO YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS AND INDEED
THERE IS A VIDEO THAT SHOWS SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED WHAT DO YOU THINK THE GORILLAS INTENTION WAS I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY FOR CERTAIN AND THIS IS THE THE SITUATION THAT FACED THE ZOO WITH THEIR DECISION OF HOW TO HANDLE IT CERTAINLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BEHAVIOUR FROM WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE VIDEO CLIP YOU CAN SEE AN ANIMAL THAT'S ON ALL FOURS
HE'S IN A TENT STANCE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER HE'S GOING TO BE AGGRESSIVE USUALLY YOU WOULD LOOK FOR FACIAL EXPRESSION TO ACTUALLY REALLY GET A READ ON THAT AND YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT ON THE VIDEO SHOTS THAT I'VE SEEN ON YOUTUBE
SO I WOULD CERTAINLY LABEL IT AS A VERY UNPREDICTABLE SITUATION AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY POWERFUL ANIMAL WHO'S STANDING OVER A QUITE DEFENSIVE AND VULNERABLE EATING HONOURABLE CHILD EVEN IF IT DOESN'T INTEND TO DO YOU HARM ITS SIZE AND ITS POWER MEANS THAT HARM CAN COME TO A CHILD IN THAT SITUATION THIS IS ALWAYS THE RISK AND WE HAVE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE GORILLAS BEHAVE WIN
CREDIBLE DEXTERITY AND INCREDIBLE GENTLENESS FOOT THERE IS ALSO REPORTS FROM THE SITUATIONS THAT THE GORILLA WAS DRAGGING THE BOY THROUGH THE WATER AND YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT A COMPARABLE AGE BABY GORILLA IS A MUCH STRONGER MUCH MORE ROBUST PHYSICAL AND BEING AND IS ABLE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF ROUGH AND TUMBLE IN COMPARISON TO A YOUNG HUMAN CHILD AS WELL THERE WAS A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN JERSEY WERE WHERE OH WHERE ARE WHERE THERE WAS A CHILD WHO ENDED UP IN A GORILLA ENCLOSURE AND AND IN THAT CASE THE CHILD WAS PROTECTED BY ONE OF THE GORILLAS WILL THERE ARE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES THERE AND I THINK THERE IS SCOPE FOR INTERPRETATION ALL DIFFERENCES WITH THIS ONE AS WELL SO THE GORILLA IN THE JERSEY SITUATION YEAH AMBO HE WAS A VERY WELL KNOWN GORILLA HE'D HAD HUMAN CONTACT
AND HE WAS A VERY HIT HIS ATTITUDE WAS A VERY GENTLE GORILLA AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT GORILLAS EXHIBIT DIFFERENT PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES JUST AS HUMANS DO BUT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT THAT SITUATION WAS THE CHILD WAS UNCONSCIOUS HE WASN'T MOVING AROUND SO THERE WAS NO POTENTIAL FOR ANY OF THE CHILD'S MOVEMENTS TO RAMP UP THE SITUATION
AND ALSO A SILVERBACKS ROLE WITHIN A GORILLA FAMILY IS TO PLACE HIMSELF BETWEEN HIS FAMILY AND POTENTIAL DANGER SO THOUGH WE LIKE TO INTERPRET INTERPRET THE AMBOS RESPONSE
BEING PROTECTIVE OF THEIR CHILD AND THAT CERTAINLY IS ONE INTERPRETATION IT COULD ALSO BE INTERPRETED AS KEEPING HIS GORILLA FAMILY AWAY FROM SOMETHING NEW IN THE EXHIBIT SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT USUALLY HAPPEN AND SOMETHING THAT WAS UNPREDICTABLE IN TERMS OF RESPONSIBLE IN HIS POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD NOT CHARACTERISE ALL GORILLAS AS THE PRIMATE SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN DID AS GENTLE GIANTS THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION IN
BEHAVIOUR AND PERSONALITY WITHIN A GROUP OF ANIMALS LIKE THIS AND THEY ARE VERY STRONG ANIMALS SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW YOU INTERPRET SITUATIONS IT'S VERY EASY FOR US TO IDENTIFY QUITE CLOSELY WITH GORILLAS THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO US IN SOME OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS GENETICALLY THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO HER SO THERE IS A PAUL FOR US TO FEEL THAT WE CAN REALLY TRULY UNDERSTAND THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A VERY SUBJECTIVE WAY ANT
IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE THAT AFTERNOON AT THE ZOO IF IT HAD BEEN YOUR CALL WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW FROM THE VIDEO AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHERE THE REST OF THE GORILLA FAMILY ARE IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE FACILITIES ARE WITHIN THE ZOO THERE IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE COMPLEX OUTSIDE ENCLOSURE FOR THE ANIMALS TO BE LIVING IN BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT OPTIONS THE THE KEEPERS HAD AND I'M SURE THEY HAD A RANGE OF OPTIONS AND HAD GONE THROUGH THAT IN THEIR HEAD
THE THING IS THEY HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE POINT THEY'D RUN THROUGH DRILLS AND PROTOCOLS THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AND THE PRIORITY HAS TO BE HUMAN LIFE AND WE WERE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAID WAS THAT THE REASON THEY COULDN'T TRANQUILLISE WAS BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG IF YOU IF YOU SHOOT A TRANQUILLISER DART AT AN ANIMAL LIKE THAT IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR IT
TO TO TAKE EFFECT IS IS THAT RIGHT YES THIS IS ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WITH TRANQUILISERS IF YOU'RE DARTING AN ANIMAL THAT'S CALM THAT SAT THERE THERE THAT'S IN A GOOD SITUATION FOR TRANQUILLISERS CAN WORKING KICKIN WITH IN QUITE A SHORT SPACE OF TIME BUT ONCE THE ANIMAL'S AGITATED THE ADRENALINE'S FLOWING AND DON'T FORGET THERE WAS A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING FROM THE PUBLIC NOT UNEXPECTEDLY
AND THAT DOES CAUSE PROBLEMS IT IS POTENTIALLY VIABLE THAT A TRANQUILLISER COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND NOT HAD THE EFFECT AND THEN YOU GET INTO THE DIFFICULT SITUATION OF IS THAT GOING TO AGITATE THE GORILLA EVEN FURTHER OR ARE YOU GOING TO RISK UPPING THE DOSE OF THE TRANQUILISER WHICH COULD EQUALLY BE DANGEROUS FOR THE GORILLA AS WELL CUSTOM PULLEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ER TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST
YES JOHN MORNING TO YOU I'M SURE MOST PEOPLE WANT TO DRY BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY AND FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET PLENTY OF FINE AND DRY WEATHER OUT THERE THROUGH THE REST OFF TODAY IF NOT ALWAYS SUNNY FOR ALL OF US IT IS THOUGH QUITE A BRIGHT AND SUNNY START ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WALES AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND AND SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND'S AND HERE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HOLD OF SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE RIGHT THROUGH INTO THE AFTERNOON IT'LL FEEL WARM NINETEEN DEGREES FOR GLASGOW FOR MANCHESTER TWENTY FOR CARDIFF AND FOR PLYMOUTH

A STUDY CARRIED OUT BY JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY FOUNDED IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF CORAL WAS EITHER DEAD OR DYING THE RESEARCH TEAM DESCRIBED IT AS THE MOST EXTREME CASE OF MASS BLEACHING THEY'D EVER MEASURED AT THE WORLD HERITAGE SITE
CORAL BLEACHING HAS BEEN LINKED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IT HAPPENS WHEN WARMER WATER CAUSES FOR CORAL TO WEAKEN AND LOSE THEIR COLOURFUL ALGAE THAT PROVIDE OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS
THIS LATEST RESEARCH WILL INCREASE CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TO CATEGORISE THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AS IN DANGER SOMETHING IT WAS SO FAR HELD BACK FROM DOING
JOHN DONNA'S AND REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IT HAS BEEN CALLED A KAFKA ESQUE SYSTEM THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS TRAPPED IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PROVE TO A PAROLE BOARD THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER A RISK THEY'RE SERVING AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE IT'S CALLED A KNIFE P. P. IMPRISONMENT FOR POLITICAL FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION MEANS THEY WERE GIVEN A MINIMUM JAIL TERM WHEN THEY WERE SENTENCE BUT NO RELEASE DATE
LABOUR INTRODUCED THEM IN TWO THOUSAND FREE AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD APPLY TO A FEW HUNDRED SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS BUT THEY WERE USED FAR MORE WIDELY KEN CLARKE WHEN HE WAS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY CALL THEM A STAIN ON THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ABOLISH THEM BUT
FOUR THOUSAND REMAIN INSIDE AND NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM HAVE SERVED MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE NOW A REVIEW HAS BEEN SET UP TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THEM ARE REPORTERS ZOE CONWAY HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THE CASE OF JAMES WARD HE WAS GIVEN A TEN MONTH SENTENCE FOR ARSON NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO HE STILL IN PRISON
CUT HIS WRISTS HE BURNED HIS PATIO OFF HIS BODY A COUPLE OF TIMES HE'S BURNT HIMSELF TO SEVERELY LASHING QUITTING HIMSELF
FIRES TO HIS CELLS YEAH DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY IT WILL GET A PHONE CALL THAT JIMMY HAS TOOK HIS OWN LIFE DEFINITELY APRIL WARD IS TALKING ABOUT HER BROTHER JAMES IN TWO THOUSAND SIX HE WAS GIVEN A TEN MONTH PRISON SENTENCE
TEN YEARS LATER HE IS STILL INSIDE HE HAS NO RELEASE DATE IS JUST GO ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS JAMES WARD WHO IS NOW THIRTY ONE HAS WRITTEN TO THE TODAY PROGRAMME TO TELL US ABOUT HIS LIFE INSIDE PRISON
AYE FINE PRISON HARD TO COPE WITH BEING TRAPPED IN A BOX I KNOW MY FAMILY ARE AMAZING THEY WANT ME OUT OF PRISON I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO GET MYSELF OUT I OUT AS MUCH TO THEM MY MYSELF I'M SORRY I FEEL REALLY FED UP
AS A TEENAGER JAMES WAS IN AND OUT OF TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE AND HIS FAMILY COULDN'T COPE WITH HIS BEHAVIOUR ONE DAY HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS FATHER BILL OVER THE FAMILY DOG ON THIS TO MORE GENERAL DEATH I'M JAMES WARD'S MUM CHRISTINE
AND THEN DOWN TO PIGGLEY DOUBLE AS A PARENT THEN KEEP ME STRAIGHT TO YOUR FACE I DON'T REALLY I DON'T THINK YOU REALISE WHERE YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WAS COVERED IN BLOOD HE CALLED LA VILLE DRESSER TOP
WELL NO ONE ELSE A NOT SO WHEN TWO FROM THE POLICE THAT ASSAULT LEAD TO JAMES BEING SENT TO PRISON FOR A YEAR HE STRUGGLED TO COPE CLOSE TO THE END OF HIS SENTENCE HE SET FIRE TO THE MATTRESS IN HIS CELL
FOR DOING THIS A JUDGE GAVE HIM AN I.P. P. OR IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION AND SAID HE SHOULD SERVE A MINIMUM OF TEN MONTHS SOME PEOPLE LISTENING MIGHT SAY HE MUST BE IN PRISON BECAUSE HE DESERVES TO BE IN PRISON HE MUST BE A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC I WAS NOT A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC NOBODY WANT TO HURT ANYBODY ALL HE'S DOING IS AYRTON SELF HE TOLD ME A BIT LEFT MISTAKE I EVER MADE A LOOK AT IT WILL DRIP AGAIN EDDIE
THEY SHOULD BE SETTING THAT ALSO STILL RIGHT AND I MAY NOT KNOW
JAMES HAS A LOW I.Q. AND HAS SUFFERED FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT HIS SENTENCE AS HE EXPLAINED IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS TO US HE RECEIVES MEDICATION FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER
I GET MY MEDS FOR A.D.H.D. EVERY MORNING DO HELP ME THAT PRISON'S NOT FIT TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE'S MADE ME WORSE HOW CAN I CHANGE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING SCARED OF WHAT THE DAY MIGHT HOLD
IN ORDER TO BE RELEASED JAMES MUST PROVE TO A PAROLE BOARD BUT HE IS NO LONGER A RISK TO THE PUBLIC THAT MIGHT SEEM STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT JAMES A SEEMINGLY TRAPPED IN A DESTRUCTIVE CYCLE BARRICADING HIMSELF INTO HIS CELL SETTING LIGHT TO HIS CELL HIS SOLICITOR HE'S PIPPA CARRUTHERS
I THINK IT LINKS TO HIS MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES I THINK IT BECOMES OVERWHELMED AT THE SITUATION AND SORE AT THE TIME WHEN HE'S ACTING IN A DESTRUCTIVE WAY HE'S NOT KEEPING IN MIND THE PAROLE BOARD TEST AND WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO
I CAN'T SEE NO END TO MY SENTENCE I'VE GOT NO FIGHT LEFT IN ME ANY MORE I'M ROTTING IN THE PRISON SYSTEM IT'S WRONG RECENTLY JAMES'S FAMILY VISITED HIM IN PRISON
HOW DID YOU FIND IT HARD DEFINITELY AND YEAH WORRIED ABOUT HIM THAT YOU KNOW THE WAY THE WAY IT LOOKS THE WAY LOOKS LIKE FOOD LAST YEAH LIKE A LOST CHILD
YOU'RE JUST CONTRARY LOOKS CONFUSED JAMES HASN'T HAD A PAROLE BOARD HEARING FOR TWO YEARS AND HE'S JUST TIRED HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED TO CARRY OUT THE NECESSARY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENTS HE COULD BE IN PRISON FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS
THAT WAS ZOE CONWAY REPORTING LINE DRAWN ON THE LINE BY KENNETH CLARK WHO WAS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY WHO ABOLISHED THOSE SENTENCES THERE WAS ARE YOU PEE PEES BUT TO MY CLERK I ASSUME YOU'RE NOT HAPPY THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE STILL IN PRISON SERVING THEM
NO I'M NOT IT'S QUITE ABSURD THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE THERE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN THEORY WHO WAS SERVING A SENTENCE WHICH PARLIAMENT AGREED TO GET RID OF COS YOU HAVEN'T WORKED AS ANYBODY INTENDED A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE TROUBLE IS THIS RIDICULOUS BURDEN ON THE PAROLE BOARD
OF SAYING THEY CAN ONLY RELEASE PEOPLE IF IT'S PROVED TO THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC IS NOT REASONABLE WELL NO PRISONER CAN PROVE THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE THAT CONTROL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE VERY LEAST AT THE MOMENT ALMOST HALF PRISONERS IN PRISONS RE OFFEND THE KEY THING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IS TO IMPROVE THAT AND WE WANT MORE OF THESE CRIMINALS NEVER ME
CRIME AGAIN AND THAT IS FIRSTLY AN EFFECTIVE PUNISHMENT AND ALL THE PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HER FINISHED THE TERM THEY WERE GIVEN AS THE
PUNISHMENT FOR THE OFFENCE THEY COMMITTED AND THEN WHAT YOU NEED IS TO MAKE THEM FIT TO GET A JOB TO GET HER HOME TO SETTLE DOWN AND WE HOPE A HIGH PROPORTION OF THEM WILL BECOME HONEST CITIZENS AND STOP OFFENDING AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE AGAIN NOW MEANWHILE YOU HAVE A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE
STILL IN OUR PRISONS WITH NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUT AND THE PAROLE BOARD THAT DENT LET THEM OUT FOR FEAR OF PUBLIC ATTACK YOU ONE OF THEM THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUS AND THEY'VE DECIDED THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE SATISFIED THAT THEY WERE SAFE WHERE YOU CAN'T BE SATISFIED SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WILL STAY THERE FOREVER BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING TO YOU WOULD SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO ON ANY ONE SIDE I WANT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION SO THAT MY KIDS DON'T GET ATTACKED IN THE STREET THAT WAS THURSDAY ALSO
I THINK THE BEST WAY OF MAKING SURE YOUR KIDS DON'T GET ATTACKED IS TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING IN PRISON WHICH MAKES THESE PEOPLE LESS LIKELY TO DO IT AGAIN THE MOMENT WE HAVE HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN PRISON THAN WE WOULD HAVE AN EVEN MORE WE'D HAVE HAD OVER NINETY THOUSAND PRISONERS BY NOW IF I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE PARLIAMENT TO GET RID OF THESE OPEN ENDED SCENT YOU DON'T LET THEM ALL OUT WOULDN'T YOU AT THE TIME I WOULD HAVE LET THEM OUT WHEN THEY'VE FINISHED THEIR CENTRE AND I'M AFRAID
AND WE WENT FOR TWENTY YEARS WHEN MOST JUSTICE POLICY WAS DETERMINED BY FEAR OF THE TABLOID NEWSPAPERS AND SO THERE WAS REGARDED AS A BRIDGE TOO FAR I DEVELOP YOUR SUCCESSOR AS WELL THEN CHRIS GRAYLING I HAVE A WORD WITH CHRIS IS BETTER ANSWER FOR HIMSELF BUT HE DIDN'T ADDRESS MICHAEL MICHAEL GO MOVE HE'S GONE BACK TO MY AGENDA AND MICHAEL GO WAS GONE BACK NOT BECAUSE HE AND I ARE SOFT ON CRIME THAT IS ABSURD
THERE AREN'T MANY LAW ABIDING PEOPLE OF SOFT ON CRIME TICKLEY MADE A VICTIM OF CRIME WE'RE GOING TO BE HE WON'T THE PRISON SYSTEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO MAKING BRITAIN A SAFER AND MORE CIVILISED PLACE CRIME IS DROPPING WINNING THE LOTTERY WE READ SUCCESSFUL IN SOME AREAS
BUT THE TROUBLE IS HE IN PRISON SLOAN'S IT OVERCROWDED SLUMS SLOGAN DON'T TACKLE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS YOU DON'T TACK OR DRUG ABUSE PROPERLY YOU DON'T GIVE PEOPLE SOME BASIC EDUCATION WHEN THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY AND YOU DON'T PREPARE THEM FOR A JOB YOU'RE ACTUALLY TOUGHENING UP SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE MORE RISK WHEN THEY COME OUT BUT YOU COULD ARGUE COULDN'T DO THAT THAT YOUR SUCCESSORS SUCCESSIVE TORY GOVERNMENTS FOR THAT MATTER HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS
WHAT YOU OBVIOUSLY THINK OF A SHOCKING STATE OF AFFAIRS OR MICHAEL GO MOVE HAS NOT ONLY WITH HIMSELF TO THE AGENDA THAT I WAS FOLLOWING BUT HE'S ADDED TO EACH I MEAN HE'S HE'S GOT A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION COULD BE HUGE PROPORTION OF THESE PRISONERS DON'T REALLY HAVE SUFFICIENT LITERACY AND NUMERACY COMPARED ALONE ANYTHING ELSE TO ENABLE THEM TO READ AN ORDINARY LIFE PARTICULARLY YOUNG CRIMINALS
THE BEST CHANCE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO OFFEND AGAIN SO I WAS THEY'RE NOT SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS ALL THIS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT DRUG ABUSERS AT THE BEST CHANCE THEY'VE GOT USED TO GET A FLAT A GIRLFRIEND AND A JOB SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HAD A JOB IN THEIR LIVES
YOU NEED TO CARRY ON THEY WERE ONE OF THE MAIN CHUTE I CONCENTRATE ON WAS GETTING EMPLOYED AS REAL LIFE EMPLOYERS IN TO TRAIN PEOPLE WHO WERE IN PRISON TO PREPARE THEM FOR WORK RIGHT SO SO THERE'S NO ROOM TO DO ALL THIS TO PRISONS ARE OVERCROWDED SLUMS WE HAVE A LOT ON CHRISTIAN LEVEL OF INCARCERATION IN THIS COUNTRY ARE QUICK FINAL THOUGHT ON THIS ONE BUT TALK ABOUT THE SECOND QUICK FINAL THOUGHT ON THIS ARE YOU SUGGESTING ARE YOU SAYING THAT EVERY SINGLE CASE SHOULD BE REVIEWED AND REVIEWED QUICK
WHAT I SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PARLIAMENT IN A SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS VEHICLE SHORT YOUR VIEWS ARE ALWAYS KEPT SECRET FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD BUT I ACTUALLY DID SUGGEST HE ALTERED THE BURDEN OF PROOF SO THE PAROLE BOARD ONLY KEPT IN THOSE WHERE THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE AND SATISFY THEM THIS PERSON WAS A DANGER LET OUT THE OTHERS THEY'VE FINISHED THEIR PUNISHMENT WHICH THEY RIGHTLY GOT BUT THE GUY YOU'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT HE'S BEEN PUNISHED FOR BURNING THE MATTRESS IN THE CELL HE SHOULDN'T BE THERE
WALKED ALMOST TEN YEARS AFTER HE'S FINISHED THE SENTENCE ALL RIGHT ANOTHER QUICK THOUGHT FOR ME ON THAT IS ON THE CIVIL WAR IN THE TORY PARTY ARE THOSE BACKBENCHERS RIGHT CERTAIN BACKBENCHERS YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE WHO SAY THAT EVEN IF MISTER CAMERON WINS THE REFERENDUM IT'S NOT GONNA STOP IN FACING A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IN OTHER WORDS HE'S A DEAD DUCK I THINK IS COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL NOT NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT DIVERTS ATTENTION THROUGH ARE WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT
THE BENEFIT THIS COUNTRY GETS AND ALWAYS HAVE THE OTHER ONE THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE TROUBLE YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT THESE COMET THEN WE DON'T WE DON'T WE JUST WOULD NOT IF I DO YOU DO ON THIS EARTH AND WE'RE ALWAYS ALONE FAR MAURICE IN THE PERSONNEL ALL RIGHT WELL THIS IS WHERE WE HAD THAT THERE WE ARE THIS GET IN THE WAY AND THERE IT'S NO GOOD TURNING LEAVE CAMPAIGN INTO A KIND OF LEADERSHIP BID FOR BORIS JOB BUT THAT IS WHAT HER IMMIGRANT FEARS THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
I'M AFRAID IT IS AND I'D LIKE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE ADDER
INFLUENCE IT GIVES IN THE WORLD LONELY COMFORT HE GIVES TO OUR FRIENDS THAT WERE LEADING MEMBERS OF THE E.U. AND THE FACT IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY A CENTRAL BASE FOR A MODERN ECONOMY IN THE MODERN WHY WHAT HAVE I DONE ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT WOMEN THE ONE OR TWO BACK BENCHERS HAVE SIGNED LETTERS CALLING FOR DAVID CAMERON TO RESIGN I THINK MOST OF THE PUBLIC WOULD AGREE IS A BIT OF A DIVERSION WHY DON'T YOU TAKE BORIS JOHNSON BEHIND THE BIKE SHEDS AND OFF
OR WHATEVER EFFORT DO YOU PREFER I DON'T THINK BORIS WOULD TAKE MOST NOTES LIKE THIS IS WORTH A TRY I THINK BORIS AND DONALD TRUMP SHOULD GO AWAY FOR A BIT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AS NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH MARTIN COUNTRIES IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FACE WE WILL NOTICE THAT YOU BRACKET BORIS JOHNSON WITH DONALD TRUMP IS ABOUT TO NISAA VERSION OF DONALD TRUMP THE CAMPAIGN IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN MY OPINION AND ABOUT AS RELEVANT TO THE REAL PROBLEMS AT THE PUBLIC FACE
DIDN'T YOU SAY YOURSELF SO THAT HE WON'T WANT YOU DITCH SO YOURSELF YOU KNEW THAT MY CAMERA WON'T LAST THIRTY SECONDS IF HE LOSES THE REFERENDUM I DON'T HE WILL OBVIOUSLY HIS AUTHORITY WILL BE DESTROYED AND THOSE WE CAN SEE HALF THE CAMPAIGNERS CAMPAIGNING BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR PRINCIPAL HOPE BRUNO WILL SUCCEED HIM OUT OF ITS NOSE AT ALL MISSUS MERCER
THAT'S DAMAGING TO THE TORY PARTY IT'S DAMAGING TO THE REFERENDUM IT'S EXTREME ANNOYS THE PUBLIC CAN REPUBLICAN GETTING FED UP WITH TORY CIVIL WARS WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE BEING ASKED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN EARNED IT I THINK ONE ONLY HAS TO ASK THEMSELVES WHY I'LL BELIEVE CAMPAIGN TURNING THE WHOLE THING INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT TURKISH CRIMINALS ABOUT TO FLOOD INTO THE COUNTRY AND BORIS JOHNSON BID FOR THE LEADERSHIP
MANY THANKS THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE NEW TOP GEAR MADE ITS DEBUT LAST NIGHT THE POST CLOCKS AN ERA FEATURING CHRIS EVANS AT THE HELM AND THE FORMER FRIENDS ACTOR MATT LE BLANC
TRIP A U.K. U.S.A. CHALLENGE I SAY SURE THEY SAY HEAD TO HEAD WITH CHRIS I SAY BRING IT ON THEY SAY BLACKPOOL I SAY WHERE
FAVOURITE LEFT THREE WHEELERS I SEE WHAT
WE WON'T KNOW TILL THE RATINGS LATER THIS MORNING HOW MANY PEOPLE TUNED IN TO WATCH ON B.B.C. TWO BUT WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE T.V. CRITIC KEVIN O'SULLIVAN AND FROM OXFORD BY AMANDA THREATENED FORMER RACING DRIVER AND NOW MOTORING EDITOR OF THE PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE CONFUSED DOT COM GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THE STAR RATING KEVIN OUT OF FIVE WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE IT
TWO OUT OF FIVE AMANDA I'M AFRAID I'LL AGREE WITH HIM AT TEAM RIGHT WHY
WELL I THINK THIS WAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR TOP GEAR TO TO REJIG THEIR FORMAT AND I THINK THE GREATER SHANE WAS ACTUALLY THAT NO REAL CHANGES TOOK PLACE AND THE FORMAT WAS TIRED WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT
EVERYBODY WAS STARTING TO THROW SOME CRITICISM AT THE WAY TOP GEAR WAS BEING PRESENTED AND I JUST THINK THIS WAS A REALLY REALLY SAD CASE OF AN OPPORTUNITY LOST BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY BRAVE THING TO DO TO HAVE THE PRESENTERS CHANGE ON THE FORMAT CHANGE AT THE SAME TIME WELL I DON'T THINK SO REALLY BECAUSE AT THE PRESENTERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT SO
YOU KNOW WE WE AREN'T REALLY LOOKING AT MOTORING EXPERTS IF YOU LIKE AS A PRESENTERS NOW WHEREAS WE WERE IN THE PREVIOUS INCARNATION WE KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A POPULAR ACTOR AND A POPULAR BROADCASTER SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T KEVIN WHY WHY DO YOU GIVE IT TO HER
WELL I THINK IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING TO DO TO JUST DELIVER THIS SORT OF FEEBLE JEREMY CLARKSON IMPRESSION DURING THE INTERMINABLE BUILD UP TO THIS PROGRAMME WE WERE TOLD CHRIS EVANS PERSONALLY SAID WE WON'T DO IT IN CLARKSON'S IMAGE WE MUST PLOUGH OUR OWN FURROW GO DOWN OUR OWN ROAD BE A NEW SHOW AND YET WE GOT THIS VERY STRANGE FEEBLE IMPERSONATION OF PARKS OR YOU DON'T MEAN THE FORMER YOU MEAN IN THAT THE DELIVERY THAT I MEAN THE FORMAT THE FORMAT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME
AND THE DELIVERY WAS CHRIS EVANS DOING AN IMPRESSION OF JEREMY CLARKSON HE ACTUALLY STARTED THE SHOW HE OPENED HIS ACCOUNT WITH A DEFINITE IMPRESSION OF JEREMY CLARKSON WAS BY THE WAY WAS VERY BAD BUT DEFINITELY AND SO IT DIDN'T INVITE DEMANDED YOU MEAN HAD A JOKE JIM YOU MEAN THE JOKE ABOUT
NO NO HE ACTUALLY DID HE DID BALLOON I'D SHOW WE HAVE HE DID A CLARKSON'S IMPRESSION WHICH WERE SO WE WEREN'T INVITED TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST WE WERE DEMANDED TO THEREFORE YOU COULDN'T EVERY SINGLE SEED YOU JUST WEAR IT WELL THIS IS JUST LIKE THE OLD SHOW WITHOUT THE LAUGHS IT WAS THERE IT WAS WITNESS THE SCRIPT WAS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD CLARKSON UM THE BLOKE HAD ALL THE CHEMISTRY OF ADMIN AND DAVID EVEN BEING GENEROUS
I'M JUST SAY IT LOOKED BEAUTIFUL THE SCRIPT WAS BAD AND SO I'M TRYING TO GIVE IT TWO STARS TO BE POSITIVE TO ALLOW IT TO IMPROVE WITH AGE AS IT GOES ON ABOUT AMANDA THREATEN WAR FIRST WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE BLOG AND SECONDLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO NEED TO BED IN ISN'T IT IT'S GOING THERE THINGS MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME IT IS AND I'M GOING TO START WITH THE SECOND POINT YOU MADE FIRST BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE VERY FIRST SERIES OF THE NEW TOP GEAR AS WE NOW LOOK BACK AT IT
WHEN THERE WAS JASON DOOR AT THE HELM WITH JEREMY CLARKSON AND RICHARD HAMMOND WAS SHOCKING THE FIRST SERIES WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING AND IN FACT YOU CAN'T SEE ANY OF THOSE EPISODES BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE ALL BEEN PULLED SO WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY WATCHING THE REPEATS ON OTHER CHANNELS ROSE THAT SERIES ONE WILL NEVER EVER BE BROADCAST SO I DO THINK WE NEED TO GIVE IT TIME
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT MATT LE BLUNT WAS GREAT BECAUSE I MEAN LET'S FACE IT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN INFORMATIVE
PROGRAMME ABOUT CARS THIS IS MEANT TO BE ENTERTAINMENT AND AS SUCH IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TARGETED AT CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE YOU MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS SO IN THAT SENSE IT WAS A SUCCESS WASN'T WAS IT A SUCCESS AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CHRIS EVANS WANTED TO DO IT WAS HE SAID MAKE IT LESS BLOKEY YEAH WELL I THINK WHEN HE SAID THIS WILL BE LESS BLOKE IS OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANT IT WOULD BE MORE P.C.
MORE IN LINE WITH PROBABLY WHAT THE B.B.C. BOSSES WANTED BUT I INTERPRET IT NOW AS LESS BLOKEY MEANS LESS FUNNY IF SO MISSION ACCOMPLISHED IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR AS FUNNY AND IT PROVED THAT CLARKSON AND HIS GANG WERE VERY INTEGRAL TO THE ENTIRE PROCESS I'M ACTUALLY JUST LET IT OUT AS I SAY THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN ROAD IT WAS A VERY STRANGE THING TO DO I ACTUALLY FOUND THIS FUNNIER THAN THE PREVIOUS TOP GET MY I ACTUALLY ENJOYED SOME OF IT AND PARTICULARLY I HAVE TO SAY THE MATT LE BLANC
PIECES WHERE HE WAS WHEN HE WAS ON HIS OWN BUT WHEN HE WAS WITH CLERKS AND IT WAS JUST YOU MEAN WITH CHRIS EVANS SO I'LL SEE YOU IN PERSON WAS I DID AND I ACTUALLY I REALLY ENJOYED IT NOW MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M ALSO HAVE THEIR FRIENDS GENERATIONS SO I HAVE A SORT OF SOFT SPOT FOR HIM AS AS JUST A PERSON AS AND AS A CHARACTER BUT I ACTUALLY THINK IN TERMS OF IT BEING LESS BLOKEY I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE THAT THEY DID SUCCEED ALTHOUGH I I DO I WHEN I DON'T WANT TO CRITICISE BECAUSE
IT'S ALWAYS THINK YOU HURT YOU PERSONALLY BUT I DID I WOULD I'VE I DID FIND THE THE CHRIS EVANS SECTIONS TERRIBLY SHOUTY AND SO ACTUALLY THAT WAS ALMOST THE ANTITHESIS TO WHAT I WAS BENEFITING FROM WITH MATT WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AS I SAID WE'LL FIND OUT THE RATINGS LATER ON TODAY A MAN TO THREATEN AND KEVIN O'SULLIVAN THANK YOU
WHAT DO YOU GIVE IT DIDN'T SAY MATE OH THAT'S A CUT WHILST YOUR BEDS I DON'T KNOW PAST MY BEDTIME AND WATCHING SOME SPORT PROBABLY SOMEWHERE DIDN'T FINISH WITH THE FRENCH OPEN BY THEN THOUGH ANDY MURRAY GETS A REST TODAY AFTER DEFEATING JOHN IS THERE IN THE FRENCH OPEN IN STRAIGHT SETS THE REFUSE ON COURT OUTBURSTS INCLUDING THE RATHER COLOURFUL DESCRIPTION OF HIMSELF AS A TURNIP

CRUISERWEIGHT TITLES LIVERPOOL'S TONY BELL YOU AT HIS BELOVED GOODISON PARK LAST NIGHT THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO IT'S LONGER MACLEOD WITH THE MAN ON THE CANVAS EARLIER IT HAD BEEN VALUE
THEY CATCH ME ME I FELT IT RIGHT TO BE LEGS BUT WHEN I GODEL IT WASN'T REALLY AN ISSUE I OF WHAT I DO I TRY TO SAY THE BE I'M SCARED FRIGHTENS ME HOW FAR I'LL GO OF SCARED THEM YOURSELF
I'M NOT MESSIN I WANT TO SAY I'M WOMAN TO DIANA RIGG THAT'S QUITE A QUOTE AND A FULL SCALE INQUIRY AT RED BALL AFTER THE BUNGLE PITSTOP WHICH DENY DRIVER DANIEL RICARDO WHAT LOOK LIKE CERTAIN VICTORY IN YESTERDAY'S MONACO GRAND PRIX THE TYRES HE COME IN FOR WE ARE AT THE BACK OF THE GARAGE ALLOWING LEWIS HAMILTON TO CLAIM HIS FIRST WIN OF THE SEASON AND CLOSE THE GAP ON MERCEDES TEAM MATE AND CHAMPIONSHIP LEADER NICO ROSBERG TWENTY FOUR POINTS AT THE KICKING CONFIDENCE OF ENGLAND'S GEORGE FORD IS
ALSO IN QUESTION THIS MORNING AFTER HIS FAILURE TO LAND ALL BUT ONE OF SEVEN PENALTIES DURING YESTERDAY'S TWENTY SEVEN THIRTEEN WIN AGAINST WALES AT TWICKENHAM THE CROWD BOOED HIM BUT HAD COACH EDDIE JONES HAS SUPPORTED HIM I THOUGHT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING THEY RUN AS A BED DAY MISSING GIRL KEEPS TIGER WOODS MISTS PAST SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS I THOUGHT HE PLAYED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL FOR US HE'S HAD A TOUGH PERIOD OF TIME YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T REALISE HOW DIFFICULT
CORRESPONDENT IN ROBERT SUMMERS AT THE GAY MORNING IAN MORNING EDDIE JONES MAY HAVE A POINT I SUPPOSE WITH HIS TIGER WOODS ANALOGY BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHAT HE MEANS BY FORD'S TOUGH PERIOD OF TIME
OF ONE OF THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS HIS CLUB SIDE FORM NOT HIS FORM BUT BATH BATH HAVE HAD AN APPALLING SEASON BY THEIR STANDARDS WITH SO MANY GOOD PLAYERS IN THERE SAY THEY'VE ENDED UP IN THE BOTTOM THIRD OF THE PREMIERSHIP AND THAT MEANS FLY HALF AND THE REST OF THE BACK SUFFER IN CONSEQUENCE COS THEY'RE NOT GETTING
DRIVE FORWARD PLATFORM AND THEY'VE HAD A POOR SEASON FROM START TO FINISH AND THAT AFFECTS AFFORD IT WHEN HE COMES TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL YOU JUST LOST HIS CONFIDENCE YOU MISSED THE FIRST KICK AND IT WASN'T A VERY DIFFICULT ONE MANY MISSED THE SECOND KICK
AND THEN SUDDENLY EVEN A KICK IN FRONT OF THE POST BECOMES A NERVE RACKING EXPERIENCE AND ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE KICKS WERE PARTICULARLY ONE WAS FROM FIRE OUT BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE KICKS HE WOULD NORMALLY GET NINETY PER CENT AND HE MISSED SIX OUT OF SEVEN FOURTEEN POINTS OTHERWISE ENGLAND WOULD'VE WON BY FORTY ONE POINTS TO THIRTEEN
THERE'D HAVE BE NO BOOING ANYBODY THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BOOED IT WAS CHEERING WHEN HE WENT OFF IT I FELT VERY SORRY FOR HER BECAUSE HE PLAYED A PERFECTLY GOOD GAME AS A FLY HALF HE HAD ONE OF THOSE SHOCKING DAYS AS A GOAL KICKER WHICH EVERY GAWK
VERY QUICKLY THE SUMMER TOURS THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IT IN AUSTRALIA WALES IN NEW ZEALAND WHAT PROSPECTS ENGLAND HAVE A GREAT CHANCE IN AUSTRALIA I KNOW AUSTRALIA REACHED THE FINAL OF THE WORLD CUP THEY WON'T HAVE ALL THE PLAYERS AVAILABLE WHO WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE WORLD CUP
THERE THEY ARE SUSCEPTIBLE THEY'VE GOT A GREAT COACH MICHAEL CHECKER BUT EDDIE JONES OR GO OUT THERE WITH A TEAM BRIMMING WITH CONFIDENCE AND THEY COULD WIN A SERIES OUT THERE THEY'VE NEVER WON A SERIES IN AUSTRALIA OR NEW ZEALAND TO THEY'VE GOT A GREAT CHANCE AND YOUR QUESTION ABOUT NEW ZEALAND WALES I'VE GOT A HORRIFIC AS A SET OF THREE TESTS
THEY'RE PLAYING THE CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD IT WOULD BE VERY SURPRISING IF THEY WON THAT SERIES BUT THEY'LL CERTAINLY PLAY A LOT BETTER IN NEW ZEALAND THAN THEY DID AT TWICKENHAM YESTERDAY IAN ROBERTSON THANKS VERY MUCH RACING TIPS CAN'T NO ONE FIFTY FIVE CIAO CELLO HUNTED AND TWO O'CLOCK LOOK AT THE CLOCK I CAN'T HEAR YOU YOU TWO HAD A LOOK HER PRIEST YEAR I FORGOT TO PUT THE NUMBERS DOWN AS WELL SO THAT WASN'T VERY HELPFUL LIKE THAT
ROB THANK YOU ANYWAY AND START THE WEEK COMES FROM THE HAY FESTIVAL THIS MORNING HERE'S TOM SUTCLIFFE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAR THIS WEEK WHAT IT INFLICTS ON THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE IT AND WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE TO LIMIT ITS HORRORS THROUGH LAW HARRY PARKER IS WITH US TO TALK ABOUT SURVIVING AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN I.U.D. AND TURNING THAT EXPERIENCE INTO ART AWARD WINNING JOURNALIST JANINE THE GIOVANNI OFFERS DISPATCHES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE LINES IN THE WAR IN SYRIA
HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER PHILIPPE'S TELLS THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW LEADING UP TO THE NUREMBERG TRIALS AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY MICHAEL HAYDEN WHO AS HEAD OF THE N.S.A. AND THE C.I.A. HAS SPENT MUCH OF HIS CAREER VERY CLOSE TO THAT THIN LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS LAWFUL IN WAR AND WHAT ISN'T
THAT START THE WEEK ON THE FINE PRINT OF WAR IN EVERY SENSE JUST AFTER NINE MOST OF THE WEATHER WARM SUNSHINE FOR MANY PEOPLE TODAY NOT HOWEVER IN THE SOUTH EAST WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE CLOUDY AND THERE WILL BE SOME RING TONIGHT THEY'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE KATHY CLAXTON HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT MORE MUST BE DONE TO SECURE BRITAIN'S COASTLINE
JOHN VINE SAYS THE U.K. BORDER FORCE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE SMUGGLERS AND MIGRANTS TRYING TO CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL YESTERDAY IT TEEN ALBANIANS WHO ARE BELIEVED TO BE MIGRANTS AND TWO BRITISH PEOPLE WERE PICKED UP OFF THE COAST OF KENT IRAQI FORCES ARE REPORTED TO HAVE ENTERED FOR LOU JET IN A NEW PHASE OF THEIR OPERATION TO RECAPTURE THE CITY FROM ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS THEY'RE SAID TO BE FACING STIFF RESISTANCE FROM
THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING CALLS TO REVIEW THE CASE IS OF MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PRISON INMATES WHO ARE SERVING INDETERMINATE SENTENCES IMPOSED FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION THE FORMER JUST TO SECRETARY KENNETH CLARKE TOLD US IT WAS ABSURD THAT MANY OF THE PRISONERS WERE STILL IN JAIL DESPITE HAVING SERVED THEIR MINIMUM TARIFF YEARS AGO
AND A WOMAN IS FEARED DEAD AFTER BEING TAKEN BY A CROCODILE DURING A LATE NIGHT SWIM IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA POLICE SAY THE VICTIM IS NOT FROM THE LOCAL AREA SOME REPORTS SUGGEST SHE COULD BE A FOREIGN TOURIST
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE POLICING OR LACK OF IT HAVE A COASTLINE UNTIL NOW IT'S BEEN LARGELY ASSUMED THE CROSSING THE CHANNEL BY BOAT IS IMPRACTICAL AS AN ILLEGAL MIGRATION ROUTE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL SHIPPING BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TWO INCIDENTS IN THE LAST WEEK REPORTEDLY INVOLVING ALBANIAN MIGRANTS COMING INTO THE SOUTH COAST THE MOST RECENT ON SATURDAY INVOLVED TWENTY PEOPLE BEING RESCUED OFF THE COAST OF DYMCHURCH NEAR FOLKSTONE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY DAMIAN COLLINS WHO IS THE M.P. FOR FOLKESTONE AND HYTHE GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING DO YOU AGREE WITH JOHN VINE THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION HE TOLD US EARLIER THAT IF THIS IS THE START OF A NEW TREND THEN IT IS ONE THAT WE NEED TO ACT ON EMERGENCY IMMEDIATELY AND TRY AND NIP IN THE BUD I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT WE SAW LAST SUMMER SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING SECURITY AT THE CALAIS PORT AND THAT COCK HELP FOR THE CHANNEL TUNNEL AS WELL IN RESPONSE TO THE MIKE AND CRISIS WHAT WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOW IS THAT
IF THAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS WHICH I THINK IT HAS IS THAT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE EVEN MORE RISKY EFFORTS TO CROSS THE CHANNEL AND THEREFORE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ALIVE TO THAT RISK AND IN IN THE AUTUMN LAST YEAR THE HOME SECRETARY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL POWERS AND RESOURCES FOR THE BORDER FORCE TO INTERCEPT VESSELS AT SEA RUBBLE WE STILL HAVE ONLY FIVE BUT OF BERBER CUTTERS ALTOGETHER THAT THE BORDER FORCE OPERATE OF WHICH IT'S THOUGHT ONLY THREE
OPERATING IN FACT I THINK THE KEY THING IS IS WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN USED AND WE KNOW THAT THE MIGRANTS ARE WE KNOW WHERE THE MARKETS THERE LARGELY END DUNKIRK IN CALAIS WE KNOW THAT THE SHORTEST CROSSING POINT IS THROUGH THE STRAITS OF DOVER INTERESTED OVER AN INCH AND INTO MY CONSTITUENCY SO THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THE CONCENTRATION OF RESOURCES AT THEIR MOST LIKELY CROSSING POINTS BUT I THINK
WITH THE WITH THE BEST THAT LANDED AT DYMCHURCH AT THE WEEKEND I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THAT IS THE FACT THERE WERE TWO BRITISH NATIONALS ON BOARD SO I THINK IN TERMS OF THE INTELLIGENCE LED RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE IT WHAT IT WHAT CAN WE DO TO IT TO MONITOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN PEOPLE TRAFFICKING GANGS
TO INTERCEPT THOSE PEOPLE AND CLOSE DOWN THEIR NETWORKS OPERATIONS IN CALAIS BEFORE THE BOATS GET IN THE WATER THAT WE CAN TRY AND PREVENT THESE VESSELS LEAVING RATHER THAN JUST INTERCEPT THEM AS THEY AS THEY CROSS THE CHANNEL I YOU SAYING THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH WITH THE RESOURCES AT THE BORDER FORCE HAVE A PRESENT FOR THE INTER
A POTENTIAL INTERCEPTION ALONG THE COAST AWAY FROM THERE AWAY FROM THE BIG PORTS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE HAS TO BE KEPT UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW MY LAST SUMMER IN RESPONSE TO THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS AT THE CAFF AND THE GROWING AT CAMP AT CALAIS THE RESPONSE TO THAT WAS AND IS A SUBSTANTIAL EXTRA INVESTMENT FROM THE HOME OFFICE AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IN IMPROVING SECURITY THERE YES AND THAT WAS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO I THOUGHT SO I THINK IT'S IF IF THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS WE THINK THERE'S NOW A GREATER RISK NOT HAVE PEOPLE BREAKING IN THERE BIT OF TRYING TO CROSS THE CHANNEL
ON SMALL VESSELS AND THAT RISK IS GROWING THEN CLEARLY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO COMBAT THAT JUST AS WE INCREASE THE RESOURCES LAST YEAR THE THREAT ON LAND AND CALAIS AND COCK DON'T YOU THINK THAT THESE TWO INCIDENTS IN THE LAST WEEK PROVIDE EXACTLY THE SORT OF EVIDENCE OF THAT
I THINK THAT THAT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY AS I SAID ME LAST YEAR I THINK THE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THIS RISK BECAUSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BORDER FORCEFUL FOR MARITIME INTERCEPTION AND ADDITIONAL POWERS GIVEN AS WELL IN THE UNDER THE
IMMIGRATION NOT JUST PASSED PASSED BY PARLIAMENT TO MAKE IT A CRIMINAL OFFENCE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ASSISTING MIGRANTS SEEKING TO CROSS THE CHANNEL IN THIS WAY SO IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE THREAT AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST HEAVILY MONITORED AREA OF WATER ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND IT'S THE WORLD'S BUSIEST SHIPPING LANE IN THE MINUTE YOU MENTION IN YOUR INTRODUCTION IT'S WHAT MAKES CROSSING THE CHANNEL SO DANGEROUS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THOSE WATERS
I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY AT THE MOMENT IS THIS IT'S A NEW TREND IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN AWARE OF THE CLEARLY IF THERE WAS A GROWING ACTIVITY OF THIS KIND WE NEED TO SEE AN INCREASE RESPONSE BOTH IN FRONT STOP PEOPLE CROSSING FROM FRANCE AND INTERCEPTING THEM AS THEY TRY TO BUT AT THE MOMENT I THINK IT'S A RISK WE ARE AWARE OF AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO FIGHT IT GAMING COLLINS M. P. THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TO NINE IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS YOU GET THREE HUNDRED POUNDS FOR SHOWING UP FOR THE DAY TO DO ANYTHING LIKE SPEAK OR EVEN VOTE JUST SHOW UP YOU CAN ALSO CLAIM EXPENSES AND IT'S THE LEVEL OF THOSE EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE ALLOWANCES THAT'S BEING QUESTIONED IN A NEW BOOK PARLIAMENT P.L.C. BY THE JOURNALIST MARTIN WILLIAMS HE'S WITH ME ON THE LINE BARONESS SMITH SMITH LABOUR'S LEADER
IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS GIVE US AN IDEA OF THE SORTS OF EXPENSES IT'S COMBINED WITH ALLOWANCES THAT SOME MEMBERS CLAIM WHO DO NOTHING WELL ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL SO IT'S BUT PARLIAMENT LIMITED L.T. P.L.C. AND FORMED THE I MEAN THIS IS COMPLETELY SHOCKING I THINK I THINK ANYONE KIND OF WITH A CAN OF ANY SENSE OF A KIND
WHAT'S REASONABLE WORLD CAN HAVE FIND THESE FIGURES AT THE KIND OF APPALLING REALLY WE'VE GOT FORTY THREE PIERS WHO CLAIMED FORTY THREE THOUSAND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PEERS WHO CLAIMED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND WITHOUT VOTING
AND THERE ARE EIGHT PEERS WHO HAVE NEITHER SPOKEN NOR VOTED AND THEY CLAIMED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE POUND WHEN YOU SAY CLAIM THAT THEIR ALLOWANCE AS WELL THE ALLOWANCE THAT SHOULDN'T YOU SEPARATE THE TWO REALLY BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU GET FOR GOING TO WORK AS WELL BUT IT'S NOT WORK IS IT IT'S TO BE A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS IS NOT CONSIDERED A FULL TIME JOB AND THE SO MANY OF THEM GO OFF AND WORK IN LUCRATIVE SECOND JOBS WORKING FOR BANKS BIG BUSINESSES EVEN LOBBYING COMPANIES AND THE ARMS TRADE
AND THE ALLOWANCE THAT THEY'RE GIVEN IT HER TAX FREE ALLOWANCE NOT A SALLOW SOME DON'T CHARGE IT TO DON'T CLAIM THAT'S TRUE SUMPS AND SOME DON'T BUT PLENTY DO AND IF WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAIMING THIS MONEY WITHOUT ACTUALLY WELL IT WITHOUT APPEARING TO MAKE ANY GREAT CONTRIBUTION AT ALL WE'VE GOT ONE ONE LORD LORD MACFARLANE WHO CLAIMED REGULAR RETURN FLIGHTS FROM GLASGOW
B. A. Y. FLIGHT'S AT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO POUNDS A POP FOR THAT IS ANOTHER LORD WHO IN TWO MONTHS YOU MADE EIGHTEEN TRIPS BETWEEN LONDON AND BLACKPOOL AND CLAIMED ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POUNDS FOR EACH TRIP OVER TWO MONTH YOU RACKED UP
TRAVEL EXPENSES WORTH OVER TWELVE THOUSAND FOR SPENDING MONEY TO GET TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS THAT'S THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CLINCH WELL YES BUT THEN WHAT ARE THEY DOING THERE WHEN THEY GET INTO THE HOUSE AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WELL THERE'S THE CASE OF LORD PADDICK THAT WAS YOU YOU MENTIONED IT WAS NINE THOUSAND QUID EACH OTHER COS HE WAS ON HOLIDAY IN THE STATES CAME BACK TO BRITAIN MADE A SPEECH NOT A VERY BIG ONE ADMITTEDLY BUT NONETHELESS HE MADE THE SPEECH WENT BACK AGAIN CHARGED ALL TOGETHER ABOUT NINE THOUSAND QUID
WELL I MEAN I MEAN IT I THINK YOU'LL BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT A REASONABLE USE OF EXPENSES NINE THOUSAND FOR A AN UNELECTED MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS
TO FLY BUSINESS CLASS FROM NEW YORK TO LONDON TO MAKE UP FOR ME IS THE UNELECTED BITTERS IRRELEVANT IF A FOUR MINUTE SPEECH AND PART OF HIS TAXPAYER FUNDED TICKET INCLUDED A A FULL FLAT BEDS ON THE ON THE B.A. PLANE IT INCLUDED ACCESS TO THE OPTION OF SPA LUXURY SPA TREATMENTS AND EVEN ALL RIGHT A MASSAGE WHEN HE GOT INTO IT WE BETTER WILL WE BUT THE LADYSMITH WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ALL
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU TRIED TO GEORGE TENSION BETWEEN THE ALLOWANCE AND THE EXPENSES MARTIN DIDN'T ANSWER THE DAILY ALLOWANCE COVERS ACCOMMODATION IF YOU'VE GOT ANY STAFF AND YOUR COST OF WORK IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS THAT THE ALLOWANCE IS THERE FOR THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT TO SCRUTINISE AND CHALLENGE LEGISLATION TO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT NEVER SOMETHING I DON'T THAT'S THE POINT WELL I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF MARTIN ALSO LOOKED AT THE COMMITTEE WORK BECAUSE
WHAT MOST TURN LIST DO WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE BOOK THE HOUSE OF LORDS OR C. HOW MANY TIMES TO SOMEBODY SPOKEN IN THE CHAMBER AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING LOADS TO DO THEM ALL ROUND TWENTY COMMITTED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHICH MEMBERS OF WORK AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE ON VERY DETAILED REPORTS MANY OF WHICH YOU COVER IN DETAIL ON YOUR PROGRAMME IN THE MORNIN SO YOU'VE GOT US ASK HIM WHETHER HE DID
CHECK ON THAT I DID AND MANY OF THESE I'M NOT INVOLVED IN ANY COMMITTEE SOME OF THEM ARE SOME OF THEM ARE BUT MANY OF THEM AT THE PITCH SOME OF THEM ARE THEY APPEARED VERY FEW PEERS I KNOW I STRUGGLE TO THINK THE COMING AND DOING NOTHING SO WHAT ASHLEY I THINK TOO MANY P. HAS EIGHT HUNDRED TO I'D LIKE TO SEE YOUR SECOND BIGGEST LEGISLATION TO THE CHINESE P.M. LET'S JOIN BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO PERSUADE ME ON THAT ONE ALL RIGHT SMALLER CHAMBER FOR SOME TIME
WE DON'T VOTE AS OFTEN AS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS PERSUADE THE GOVERNMENT BY ADVOCACY WHEN NEEDS WHO WE VOTE I THINK THINGS LIKE THE TAX CREDITS TO TRADE UNION BILL ALF DUBS AMENDMENT WHICH YOU SPOKE OF IN YOUR PROGRAMME ON CHILL CHILD REFUGEE EATON'S WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WORKS THE LORDS DOES A MOST PEONS ARE VERY MUCH VERY CLEAR THOUGH THIS IS NOT ABOUT SAYING THAT
POLITICIAN SHOULD HAVE NO EXPENSES WE CAN LOOK AT THE CONNAUGHT L. ALLOWANCES IT'S SPEND IT WELL DON'T SHOULD LOOK LIKE THAT'S NOT ABOUT SAYING THERE SHOULD BE NO MONEY FOR POLITICIANS THIS IS ABOUT SAYING WE'VE WE'VE WE HAD THE EXPENSES SCANDAL IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE WERE TOLD BUT POLITICIANS POP ON ALL SIDES OF THE HOUSE PROMISED US THAT THEY WERE CLEAN UP THEIR ACT AND AND THERE HAVE BEEN FOR ME WHAT IT IS BUT THIS LOT IF YOU NEED TO IF I MY ENTITLEMENT O.K. LET ME JUST SAY PRESENTLY
I THINK IT'S A BIT UNFAIR HE'S TRYING TO SORT OF TOP ALL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS ARE GREED AND CORRUPTION I SIT THERE EVERY DAY I SEE PEOPLE WORK EXTRAORDINARY HARD VERY LONG HOURS TO SCRUTINISE LEGISLATION AND WHAT ABOUT THIS METAL LEGISLATION AS A RESULT LET'S TAKE A BIT OF OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A STERLING JOB DONNA MOST THAT MOTEL THEY'RE FAR MORE THAT WERE OVERWHELMINGLY ALL RIGHT NO MORE THAT COME IN WE JUST FINISHED A POINT JOHN
SOME OF THOSE THAT COME IN WHO DO THAT WORK AND DON'T CLEAN ANYTHING AT ALL NOW I DON'T WANT TO PARLIAMENT OF RICH PEOPLE I WANT TO SEE A BALANCE OF PARLIAMENT AS THOSE WHO DO COME IN AND USE THOSE ALLOWANCES TO DO GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY AND WHAT A SERVICE AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE TO DO NOTHING I'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THOSE THAT DO NOTHING AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN A VERY FEW RIGHT BUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THOSE CASES WE HAVE TAKEN THE MICKEY WHAT SHUT UP
AS WE'VE SEEN BEFORE THE HOUSE OF LORDS IS VERY QUICK TO TAKE ACTION IF SOMEONE CLAIMS INAPPROPRIATELY DOING IT LIKE A CHARGING AT THREE HUNDRED QUID COMING IN THERE I'M IN A CUP OF COFFEE ON THE GO AND OMEGA I THINK THAT'S COS IF THERE ARE PEOPLE DOING NOTHING JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE DOESN'T SPEAK OR VOTE ON THAT DAY DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT DOING OTHER WORK AND THAT'S NOT A PUMP TO CHECK ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF WORK THAT GOES ON
I TALKED TO COLLEAGUES WHO MAY NOT BE GREAT ORATORS ARE NOT THERE COS THEY'RE GREAT ORATORS THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME EXPERT TELL US CAN I SHOW OF COLLEAGUES AND WORKING COMMITTEES ON ALL RIGHT QUICK GET IT CAN I JUST PUT THIS VERY QUICKLY AND CONTACTS WE THESE ARE YOU GOING FOR ANYTHING ELSE IN WHAT CONTEXT YOU LIKE THAT AND THEN EVEN PRINTED AND ALLOWANCES COME ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT POLITICIANS ARE IN THE HOUSE IN THE IN THE LORDS AND IN THE COMMONS
ARE MAKING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO LUCRATIVE SECOND JOB I KNOW IT'S NOT ALL SOME OF THEM ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ALL RIGHT THEY ARE IN FOG WE DID IT WE DID IT LET'S HOLD EXCLUSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS IN THE BOOK OF OF POLITICIANS AND THE COMPANIES THEY'RE INVOLVED IN AND WE FOUND THERE ARE NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES HAVE POLITICIAN SAT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THEY MAKE A VERY GOOD LINE TWENTY BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT GO QUICK QUICK RESPONSE TO THAT EXPERTISE SOME LAWS I HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THE SUPPOSED TO HAVE INTERESTS OUTSIDE TO BE CHARITY INTERESTS IT CAN BE JOURNALISM OR BIG BUSINESS EXPERTS OR IT MAY BE BUT MANY MANY MANY DON'T ALL RIGHT I THINK YOU GIVEN A VERY UNBALANCED VIEW OF WHAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WORK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR BOTH FROM BOTH LIVE BUT I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT LORD PADDED BRIAN PADDICK HAS MADE A STATEMENT BECAUSE
THE STORY APPEARED IN THE SUNDAY TIMES THE ONLY TED I SOUGHT THE ADVICE OF THE CHIEF WHIP AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS AUTHORITIES BEFORE TRAVELLING OH VIS-A-VIS WHAT DICK AND I SHOULD BUY I GAVE UP TWO DAYS OF MY HOLIDAY TO SPEAK IN AN IMPORTANT DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT SO THERE WE ARE HE SAID HE DIDN'T GAIN FINANCIALLY FROM THE CLAIM THANK YOU BOTH MARTYN WILLIAMS AND BARON OR SMITH
IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE IS IT STILL POSSIBLE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE HAVING FULFILLED ONE OF HIS FIRST PLEDGES IN OFFICE TO CLOSE THE DETENTION CAMP AT GUANTANAMO BAY NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BUT IT STILL HOLDS EIGHTY PRISONERS AND WITH THE RISE OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE KEPT OPEN A NORTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT TO LIMA BULL HAS BEEN TO SEE WHAT THE CAMP IS LIKE KEEPING THOSE FOR SOUL ORPHAN IS CONTRARY TO ABOUT YOUS
IT UNDERMINES OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD IT IS VIEWED AS A STAIN ON OUR BROADER RECORD OF UPHOLDING
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ALL THE WAR THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS AND IN HIS FINAL MONTHS IN OFFICE THE REMAINING EIGHTY PRISONERS AT THE SPRAWLING COMPLEX OF GUANTANAMO BAY IS DETENTION CENTRE ARE WONDERING WHAT COULD HAPPEN
WE GOT SHOWN INSIDE THE LOWEST SECURITY WING WHERE WE SAW THE INMATES HAVING THEIR COMMUNAL TIME SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN FOURTEEN YEARS WITHOUT TRIAL OR EVEN HAVING BEEN OFFICIALLY TOLD THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM
DARK IN HERE BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING
PRISONER THROUGH ONE WAY GLASS AND IS FAR EMPTIER THAN EVEN A YEAR AGO
MANY HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN RECENT MONTHS THOSE LEFT BEHIND HAVE BEEN HERE SO LONG IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE USED TO THEIR MEALTIME ROUTINES
SYSTEM AMONG THEMSELVES FOR DISHING OUT AND CLEANING UP HE SAW AS THEY PACED AROUND THE SPACE THEY HAVE TO GET EXERCISE AND SAW SOME INTERACTING WITH THE GUARDS
THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS HERE NOW HE'S JUST A TENTH OF WHAT THERE ONCE WAS AND MORE RELEASES ARE DUE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
BUT AROUND TWO THOUSAND SOLDIERS STILL OPERATE THE PLACE WE STARTED OUT CAMP X. RAY THEY'RE KEPT FOR CAMP DELTA IN CHARGE OF THEM IS PRISON COMMANDER COLONEL DAVID HEATH IF YOU'D BEEN HERE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT HERE AND NOW YOU
GENERAL I WOULDN'T SEE ANY APPROACHABLE DIFFERENCE BUT THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M REQUIRED TO PLAN FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO HERE AND DO YOU SEE ANY REASON WHY A FACILITY LIKE
LIKE THIS COULDN'T HOLD THE SAME DETAINEES BUT ON THE MAIN
AND APPROPRIATE SECURITY CONDITIONS IN THERE IN THE UNITED STATES THESE DETAINEES
THERE THAT THEY WERE THEN THEY DO HERE AS LONG AS HAVE SECURITY IS
APPROPRIATE OR EVEN THE NAME GUANTANAMO CONJURES UP IMAGES OF ORANGE JUMPSUITS IT'S ANONYMOUS WITH ISSUES AROUND TORCH AND FORCE FEEDING AND WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE WHILE STILL STANDING IT REMAINS A POWERFUL RECRUITING TOOL FOR MILITANT GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD IN ROAD NOR NO
BY THE SET HERE IN ITS BRUTAL PROPAGANDA VIDEOS SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE EVEN EVOKES IMAGES OF GUANTANAMO INCLUDING THOSE PRISON UNIFORMS AS AN EXAMPLE OF AMERICAN HYPOCRISY AND CLOSE DOWN ONE SO THE WHITE HOUSE ONCE IT SHOT THE OFFICERS RUNNING IT THINK THE PRISONERS COULD BE HOUSED ELSEWHERE AND IT SEEN BY MANY AS A SMEAR ON AMERICA'S REPUTATION SO WHY IS GWEN TURNER MOAT STILL OPEN
THE ANSWER IS CONTINUED POLITICAL OPPOSITION BACK IN WASHINGTON GUANTANAMO BAY NEEDS TO BE KEPT UP IN THEIR OWN WAY TO DETAIN THESE UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANTS BUT THE NEXT ONE'S MARK POMPEII IS ONE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WHO'S BEEN MOST VOCALLY OPPOSED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN THERE ARE MANY REASONS THEY SHOULD BE KEPT THERE ONCE THEY COME TO THE UNITED STATES THEY WILL HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS OF A U.S. INNOCENT HE'S IN DETENTION THAT MEANS THEY'LL HAVE
OUR LAWYERS AND THEIR RIGHT NOT TO SPEAK
BUT THESE WERE MEMBERS OF A TERROR NETWORK IT'S AN INTENTIONAL DECEPTION ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT IN HIS ALPHA TO CLOSE THIS FACILITY IT'S WRONG TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ISLAMIC WORLD THAT THIS FACILITY AS WHAT COUSINS THERE SHE HARD WE KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE MOTIVATION AND WE SHOULD DEAL WITH GUANTANAMO BAY ON THE FAX I SOME MADE UP RATIONALE FOR ITS POTENTIAL CLOSURE THERE WERE PARTS OF GUANTANAMO WE WEREN'T SHOWN WHICH HOUSED MEN DEEMED SO DANGEROUS AMERICAN EVER WANTS THEM RELEASED BUT AFTER ALL THE TALK WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND TO THE DETENTION CENTRE AS A HOLE NOW LOOKS AN ISSUE THAT WILL BE LEFT TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT
ALI MABLE REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE IT'S SAD SEEING A LOVELY OLD BUILDING FALLING INTO DECAY AND EVENTUALLY PERHAPS BEING REPLACED BY A MODERN CONCRETE MONSTROSITY MORE THAN SAD OUTRAGEOUS ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKER NICK BROOMFIELD I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM ABOUT A FILM HE MADE FOR B. B. C. FOR ABOUT A COUPLE OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS ONE IN LIVERPOOL ONE IN CARDIFF THE OLD COAL EXCHANGE IN THE BUTETOWN AREA OF THE CITY
WE OBVIOUSLY HAD A LONG LIST OF BUILDINGS LIKE THE COAL EXCHANGE IN THE WILLING TO ROOMS THERE WERE MANY IN MANY WAYS VERY FINE HISTORICAL BUILDINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE TOWN HALL IN SHEFFIELD
VERY MUCH A CENTRE OF SHEFFIELD JUST FALLING TO PIECES WAS JUST ONE OTHER EXAMPLE IT ALWAYS SORT OF COMES TO THE SAME THING WHICH IS THESE BUILDINGS AND THOSE SITES ARE WORTH MORE MONEY WITH NEW BUILDINGS ON THEM THAN THEY ARE WITH THE BUILDINGS THAT EXISTS AT THE MOMENT
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT ISN'T IT IF YOU'RE A CITY COUNCIL OR WHATEVER PUBLIC BODY IT HAPPENS TO BE AND YOU FACE THE CHOICE BETWEEN
SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY THE PUBLIC'S MONEY PROTECTING A BUILDING AND USING THAT MONEY TO DEVELOP NEW HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED HOMES FOR INSTANCE
WELL I THINK THAT ABOUT A QUAD THAT'S TRUE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF CAUSES THESE BUILDINGS BEEN EMPTY FOR TWENTY YEARS SO ALL THE LEAD'S BEEN STRIPPED OFF THEM AND THEY'RE NOW IN A CHRONIC STATE OF DISREPAIR SO OFTEN IT'S BEEN TAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO THEIR DECISIONS
BY PEOPLE GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMMUNITY I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IN BUTE TOWN THERE WAS A PHONE CALL AS ME IMAGE IN CARDIFF FANTASTIC COMMUNITY OF OVER FIFTY NATIONALITIES ALL OF THEM GOT ON INCREDIBLY WELL
AND IT WAS A MAGICAL PLACE AND ALL THESE PLANNING DECISIONS WERE TAKEN WHERE BY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS BROKEN UP AND THESE REALLY AWFUL HOUSES WERE PUT UP I KNOW CARDIFF VERY WELL I WAS BORN THERE REMEMBER WHAT YOU DESCRIBE IT VERY WELL INDEED
A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW SAY WHAT HOW WONDERFUL CARDIFF BAY IS FULL OF PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE THERE IT'S VERY IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE OTHER PEOPLE OF COURSE IT LOOKS LIKE LEGO LAND ON THEY HATED THEM BUT HOW DO YOU LET HER DECISION
WELL I THINK THAT IT'S ALL TO DO WITH PLACES EMBRACING THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR HISTORICAL HERITAGE AND TAKING THE BEST OF IT INTO THE FUTURE
SO WHAT YOU HAVE PRAY GOD WILL WAKE UP ONE OF THESE FINE DAYS LOOK FOR OUR HERITAGE AND IT WON'T BE THERE
WELL I DO OR IN ANY KIND OF CONSIDERED WAY ARE YOU I THINK YOU KNOW LIVERPOOL IN A SENSE IS UNUSUAL IN THAT IT'S EMBRACED ITS
SLAVERY IS AND IT'S KIND OF TURNED IT VERY MUCH TO ITS ADVANTAGE AND MADE IT VERY INTERESTING POINT OF HER BITS
CITY HAVE MADE IT VERY ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE TO COME TO AND I THINK IT'S A KIND OF LONGER TERM PLAN AND SO MUCH PLANNING HAS BEEN ABOUT SHOT SHORT TERM GAIN WHICH HAS MEANT THAT A LOT OF MAGNIFICENT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE SHORT TERM GAIN IS TO REBUILD VERY VERY QUICKLY
I DON'T THINK IT GAINS MORE MONEY IN THE LONG TERM FAR FROM IT
NICK BROOMFIELD THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S FIVE TO NINE BEYOND AN ONLINE SHOPPING HABIT TO TOO MANY OF US HAVE A HABIT OF RETURNING WHAT WE BUY ON LINE SO MUCH SO THAT BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO COPE RESEARCH FOR YOU AND YOURS ON RADIO FOUR HAS FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CLOTHES BOUGHT ONLINE ARE SENT BACK
WE'RE JOINED FROM THE RADIO CAR BY JUSTIN OPIE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF IRON MARJORIE THE U.K.'S ONLINE RETAIL ASSOCIATION AND FROM LEEDS BY THE RETAIL ANALYST KATE HARDCASTLE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HARDCASTLE ISN'T IS A NECESSARY PART OF THE CONCEPT OF PEOPLE BUYING GOODS UNSEEN
VERY MUCH THE CONSUMER SITES THAT THE AVAILABILITY CONVENIENCE AND A GOOD RETURNS POLICY ARE ALL AMONGST THE REASONS THAT THEY WOULD SHOP ONLINE AND THEY LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TRUST IN THAT THE LAW IS ON THEIR SIDE FOR RETURNING THINGS WITHOUT HASSLE AND THEY SEE IT AS ONE OF THE MORE CONVENIENT PARTS OF THE PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN TRY ITEMS ON ONLINE WITH THEIR OWN WARDROBE IN THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN HOME SO THAT MEANS JUST AN L.P. THAT RETAILERS SHOULD JUST ACCEPT THAT THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL
I THINK IT'S A BIT OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THOUGH BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE ON ONE HAND THE RETAILERS HAVE TO MAKE THE RETURNS AS CHEAP AND CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE
BUT SIMILARLY IN DOING SO THAT MEANS THE RETURNS RATE RISES SO IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE BUT IT'S SUCH A HOTLY CONTESTED ENVIRONMENT IT'S AN ESSENTIAL IS A SORT OF ESSENTIAL STRATEGY FOR THE RETAILERS BUT DO YOU THINK IT IS BECOMING A PROBLEM IF IT IS THIS PROPORTION IF THIS SURVEY IS BORNE OUT AND THEY DID THIS PROPORTION OF CLOTHES BOUGHT ONLINE THAT ARE BEING SENT BACK AND IT DOES THAT
DOES THAT MEAN THINGS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE IN TERMS OF PRICING OF THE ITEMS THEMSELVES ALL DELIVERY COSTS
I THINK YOU'RE SEEING PRICING EVOLVE ANYWAY I MEAN FOR KNOW FOR QUITE A LONG TIME NOW CONSUMERS HAVE EXPECTED FREE DELIVERY AND FREE RETURNS
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE IN SOME CASES THAT THE PRICING THRESHOLD FOR DELIVERY FOR FREE DELIVERY INCREASE AND ALSO RETAILERS YES THEY DO RECOGNISE US OF A VERY REAL COST TO PROVIDING THIS SERVICE BUT IT'S A KIND OF A TRADE OFF
IF THEY DON'T PROVIDE THIS THIS FREE SERVICE INCONVENIENCE THEN OF COURSE THERE IS A RISK THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE MARKET SHARE AND ULTIMATELY I SUPPOSE THE POWER RESTS WITH THE CONSUMER AND IF THE CONSUMER IS ABLE TO SOURCE GOODS TO BUY GOODS FOR FREE AND TO RETURN THEM FOR FREE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY LOOK FOR
IN THE RETAIL IS UNDER AN AWFUL LOT OF PRESSURE TO THE BLONDE THERE'S AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN THE THRESHOLD FOR ANY FREE DELIVERY ORRIN AND INDEED WHETHER RETAILERS OFFER A FREE RETURN SERVICE HUGE AMOUNT OF VARIATION IN THAT KATE HARDCASTLE
IS THERE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH WOMEN'S WEAR BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM FROM THIS SURVEY IS THAT IT IS MORE WOMEN'S WEAR THAT IS BEING SENT BACK THEN OTHER CLOTHING I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE IS THAT THE WOMAN IS NOW HAVING MORE POWER AND MORE CONSUMER POWER AT HER FINGERTIPS SHE'S ENJOYING THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE AND TRY DIFFERENT STYLES DIFFERENT SIZES IN THE COMFORT OF HER OWN HER AND I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM THE STATES WERE ACTUALLY COMPANIES THERE ARE USING THAT AS A REASON TO SELL
THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHAT ORDER AS MANY DIFFERENT STYLES YOU WANT DO YOU WANT A BIT OF SIZE OR SEE YOU CAN BE FULLY COMFORTABLE IN OUR TRANSACTION AS JUST MENTIONED YOU SEVENTY EIGHTY PERCENT OF ONLINE CONSUMERS ARE SAYING IF THERE'S HASSLE FREE RETURNS THEN THE RARE TINA MY INTERACTION WITH THAT STAR IS GOING TO BE HIGHER BUT THIS IS A TRADE OFF AGAINST A VERY EXPENSIVE ROWAN
INSTALL YOU KNOW HIGH STREET OFFER WITH MANY MANY STAFF SO ONE COST KIND OF WORK OUT AGAINST THE OTHER SO JUST AN OPI THE WOMAN CONSUMER WHO DOES THAT IS NOT IT IS SHE ACTING UNREASONABLY OR UNFAIRLY TO THE RETAILER BY PASSED BY MORE THAN SHE NEEDS WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF SENDING THINGS BACK
I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN I THINK CONSUMERS ARE GOING TO BEHAVE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY TO THEM AND IT IS TRUE ACTUALLY WE DID SOME RESEARCH AND WE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME RESULTS ON AS AN ITEM
ADDRESSES ARE BY FAR THE MOST IN A GARMENT MOST HIGHLY RETURN ALL RIGHT JUSTIN OPIE AND KATE HARDCASTLE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THAT'S IT FROM US OR EDITORS TODAY WERE DID MACMILLAN AND ANDREW ADAM COMISKEY COMING UP THE HAY FESTIVAL ON START THE WEEK
