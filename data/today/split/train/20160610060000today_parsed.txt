NOT JUST HERE IN THE CITY CENTRE BUT ALSO AT THE NATIONAL STADIUM WHERE THE GAMES KICK OFF THIS EVENING THEY HAVE BEEN WARNINGS FROM BRITISH AND U.S. INTELLIGENCE AMONGST OTHERS THAT TOURNAMENT COULD BE TARGETED IN THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE WILL BE ALSO EXAMINING WITH A FORMER FRENCH INTERNATIONAL
OF IMMIGRANT BACKGROUND THE STATE OF MULTICULTURALISM IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL OF COURSE AS TRYING TO PREDICT WITH ALAN SHEARER HOW FAR WALES NORTHERN IRELAND AND ENGLAND MIGHT PROGRESS I'M JUST GOING TO PICK UP SOME OF THAT
NEWSPAPERS HERE THIS MORNING AND LE FIGARO PICKS UP ON THAT STORY THAT WE HEARD
OF IN THE NEWS ABOUT THE STRIKES BECAUSE IT IS THE LESS THE SECURITY SITUATION AT THE MOMENT AND MORE THE SITUATION OF THE UNIONS WHO HAVE BEEN HOLDING ALL SORTS OF STRIKES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THE GOVERNMENT DENOUNCING THE GORILLA UNIONS AS CONCERN IS GROWING BUT THEY COULD TARNISH THE START OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS HERE LE MONDE ALSO COVERS THAT STORY AND TALKS OF A TENSE SOCIAL CLIMATE FOR THE BEGINNING
OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS ALSO IN LE MONS THEY MENTION SOME SMALL CLASHES THAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY IN MA BETWEEN ENGLAND SUPPORTERS AND WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS LOCAL YOUTHS AND THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING PICKED UP IN THE MIRROR THIS MORNING WHICH IS COVERING JUST THOSE SMALL DISTURBANCES
THE BIG STORY FOR THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS THE TIMES HEADLINE SCIENTIST CLOSE TO M. S. CURE M.S. IT SAYS IS CLOSE TO BEING CURED AFTER A PIONEERING TREATMENT WAS FOUND TO STOP AND EVEN REVERSE THE DISEASE HE SAID LAST NIGHT RESULTS OF THE TRIAL WERE HILDA'S REMARKABLE WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THE DIMBLEBY DEBILITATING DIVVIES HALTED IN ALMOST ALL PATIENTS WHO HAD THE TREATMENT A QUARTER OF THE M.S. SUFFERERS HAD THEIR CONDITIONS AFFECTED BE SUPPRESSED
THE GUARDIAN DESCRIBED IT AS A RADICAL AND RISKY STEM CELL THERAPY BUT SAYS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HOLT AND EVEN REVERSE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS MEL'S TORY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE
HAS A STORY ABOUT SIR PHILIP GREEN A PHOTOGRAPH HOVERING OUTSIDE HIS OFFICERS IN LONDON THIS WEEK HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE COUNTRY FOR SIX WEEKS IT'S RYAN AS HAUNTED AND UNSHAVEN HE CUTS A SORRY FIGURE AS THE CRISIS AROUND THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. DEEPENED LAST YEAR
IT'S HEADLINE A STRIP SO SHIFTY OF HIS TITLE THERE IS ALSO SOME COVERAGE IN THE NEWSPAPERS ARE BOTH TEACHERS TEACHER TRAINING A PARTICULAR BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS JULIAN HARGREAVES IS OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT QUITE A SERIOUS SHORTAGE JULIA
SCATHING ATTACK FROM THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE ON THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION'S ABILITY TO SORT THIS PROBLEM OUT THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE IN A REPORT PUBLISHED TODAY SAYS THAT THE D. F. E. IS WOEFULLY ALOOF AWAY FROM THE DIFFICULTIES THAT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS
FACE TRYING TO RECRUIT TEACHERS WHO ARE QUALIFIED IN THE RIGHT SUBJECTS IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN POORER AREAS ISOLATED AREAS AND PLACES WHERE THIS HISTORICALLY A LOWER ATTAINMENT RATE FOR PUPILS IT'S AS THOUGH TEACHERS REALLY ARE NOT FINDING THOSE SORT OF PLACES APPEALING AND HEAD TEACHERS ARE STRUGGLING TO RECRUIT
HE DID THE THE INCIDENCE OF TRAINEE TEACHERS VARIES A LOT ACROSS ENGLAND AS WELL TEACHER TRAINING PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE WIDE VARIATIONS THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE TRAINEES EGGS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EAST OF ENGLAND FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS COMPARED WITH FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN TRAINEES FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS IN THE NORTH WEST SO THEY'RE A REALLY ACUTE REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS ACCUSED OF NOT PLANNING WELL ENOUGH
I'M NOT DOING ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ROOTS INTO TEACHING EASY CLEAN AND ENTICING ENOUGH GRADUATES IN THE RIGHT SUBJECTS TO COME FORWARD TO ENTER THAT CAREER TO M.P.S HAVE A SOLUTION
WELL THEY SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS A PROPER PLAN AND ALSO NEEDS TO KEEP TABS ON THE MONEY MORE ADEQUATELY THERE IS A SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION POUND BURSARY SCHEME TO TRY TO ATTRACT GRADUATES IN SUBJECTS LIKE MATHS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY WHETHER IN NATIONAL SHORTAGES OF TEACHERS AND THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT PROPERLY
KEEPING ITS EYE ON THAT MONEY AND WHAT GRADUATES ARE DOING THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO'RE TAKING THESE BURSARIES OR EVEN COMPLETING TEACHER TRAINING COURSES NEVER MIND IF THEY ENTER THE PROFESSION AND GET A JOB AS A TEACHER AND THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT'S NOT ADEQUATE SOLDIER AND A QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT MICHAEL WILSHAW THE CHIEF INSPECTOR HE IS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO SOME CHILDREN WHEN THEY LEAVE PRIMARY SCHOOL
YES NOW HE'S APPEARING ON THE PROGRAMME LATER THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND HE SAYS THAT THE VERY BRIGHTEST CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING ENCOURAGED ADEQUATELY WHEN THEY GET INTO SECONDARY SCHOOL SO SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT JOHN OF CHILDREN WHO GET THEIR TOP LEVEL AT PRIMARY SCHOOL IN THEIR TESTS AT ELEVEN
FAIL TO GET AN A OR A.STAR GRADE WHEN THEY GET INTO SECONDARY SCHOOL AND HE SAYS THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THEY ARE CLEARLY NOT BEING PUSHED AT THEIR LEVEL AND ENCOURAGED AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY ARE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL IN SECONDARY SCHOOL AND THEY TEND TO COAST ALONG AND THEN SIMPLY DON'T GET THE GRADES THAT THEY WERE PERFECTLY WELL CAPABLE OFFICE PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN
AND YOU SENSE THAT IS IS IT IT IS A SYMPTOM OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS THAT THEY ARE NOT PUSHING THE VERY BEST PUPILS WELL ENOUGH AND YOU SAID THAT'S GOT ALL SORTS OF IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY IF THE VERY BRIGHTEST CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING THE TOP GRADES AT SIXTEEN THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING THANK YOU JULIAN AS YOU SAY WILL BE TALKING TO SIR MICHAEL ARE TOUGH BUT HELP US UP
SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX ONE OF THE MANY CLOUDS HANGING OVER FRANCE AS THE EUROSTAR TODAY'S THE POOR ECONOMIC SITUATION STAGNATION REALLY IN THIS COUNTRY SLUGGISH ECONOMIC GROWTH TO IN THE U.K. AS WE ARE IN THE RUN UP TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS FROM TANYA BECKETT MORNING TONY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MATTHEW THANKS VERY MUCH WELL YES THE CONCERN IS THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NOT PICKING UP FAST ENOUGH BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AT A RECORD LOW FOR FOUR YEARS
THESE ARE THE MESSAGES EMERGING FROM THE LATEST FORECAST FROM THE INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES LOOMING LARGE OF COURSE OVER EVERYTHING IS THE LACKLUSTRE PERFORMANCE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE FAST APPROACHING VOTE ON A POSSIBLE BRAX IT DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS FOR THE INSTITUTE OF CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS STEPHEN AND STEVE LET'S START WITH BUSINESS INVESTMENT HOW IS THAT LOOKING
AND IF IT'S WEAK WHICH IT IS WHY GOOD MORNING TANYA I SERVE IN THE BUSINESS INVESTMENT IS INDEED DECLINE AND IT WAS PROBABLY SIX PERCENT LAST YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT FOUR PER CENT AND OUR LATEST FORECAST THIS YEAR THE GROWTH THAT DOESN'T SOUND TERRIBLY WEAK TO BE HER THEY'D SLOW FOUR PER CENT IS QUITE LOW AND THE REASONS FOR THAT PROBABLY WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE THE SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CERTAINLY IN THE U.K. CONCERN AROUND A POSSIBLE BREAKS IT
AND THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ACRIMONIOUS AFTERMATH IF THERE WAS A BRECK'S THAT THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT YES THAT'S TRUE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE ALSO CONCERNED AT THIS MOMENT ABOUT UNCERTAINTY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEREFORE WHEN THAT
AS THE SITUATION PEOPLE WILL PERHAPS STOP SPENDING MONEY AND STOP INVESTMENT UNTIL THEY'RE A BIT CLEAR ON WHAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN POST FINANCIAL CRISIS OUR ASSESSMENT OF ECONOMIES HAS OF COURSE CHANGE BECAUSE ECONOMIES HAVE RESTRUCTURED ALSO BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY SO SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BUSINESS INVESTMENT REALLY AS A BAROMETER IN THE SAME WAY
IT'S STILL A VERY IMPORTANT INDICATOR I MEAN INVESTMENT IS A LEAD AN INDICATOR OF LIKELY ECONOMIC GROWTH AND AS YOU SAID EARLIER FROM A SURVEY OF TOT ACCOUNTANT FINANCE DIRECTORS WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND SHOWING TO DECLINE AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS DOWN TO ALMOST FLAT AT THE MOMENT FROM A IN AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN
WHAT TENDS TO BE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT BUSINESS MISSUS SPEND MONEY AND THEN SUN SOMETIME AFTER THE ECONOMY GROWS FOR WHAT'S THE TIME LAG WHILE THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS AND TRACKS VERY CLOSELY IT CLEARLY AS A LEAD IN BUT IT'S VERY VERY STRONG INDICATOR AND WE ARE WE
THAT GREAT HAD NOT AT THIS MOMENT BUT THE LESS TIME ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE U.K. TO TWO PER CENT WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF OTHERS FOLLOWED US AND IF CONFIDENCE CONTINUES TO DECLINE WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THAT DECLINE AS WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTING IN THE LIGHTER LOWER PRICES AND VERY LOW INTEREST RATES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE CONSUMER DEMAND EST AND STRONG WHEN IT'S THERE'S ANOTHER FACTOR THEY'RE STILL ABOUT TWO PER CENT WAYS GROWTH WHICH IN A ZERO INFLATION ENVIRONMENT IS GIVEN REAL GROWTH IN WAGES FOR PEOPLE SO CONSUMER DEMAND IS QUITE STRONG BUT
AS AS WEEPS BUSINESS CONFIDENCE IS QUITE LOW STEVEN EDSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE NOW TO OIL PRICES AS WE KNOW THEY'VE SEEN SOME TWENTY SIXTEEN HIGHS RECENTLY THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRASS IT APPEARS THAT OR PRICES HAVE BEEN ON A PRETTY STRONG RECOVERY FROM FORGETTING A FUR TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THAT OF COURSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REALLY DRAMATIC SLIDE WE SAW SINCE THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN UP UNTIL THAT POINT I THINK IT OUT THIS MORNING FROM OIL AND GAS U.K. WHICH IS THE U.K.
OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION GIVE US A CLEAR IMPACT A PICTURE OF THE IMPACT OF THE OIL PRICE DOWN TERM THAT WE SAW PRICE AT THE START OF THIS YEAR ON JOBS DID COMMITTEE IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF OIL AND GAS U.K. SHE JOINS US NOW FROM OUR STUDIO IN ABERDEEN WHICH OF COURSE IS THE BEATING HEART OF THE U.K.'S OIL INDUSTRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU DID SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO JOBS AND AS I'VE SAID IN ALL PRICES APPEAR TO BE ON THE TURN SO ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE AFFECTING OIL COMPANIES OUTLOOKS ON FOR COSTS
YES GOOD MORNING TANYA SO YET TODAY WE ARE SHARING OUR LATEST EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR THE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND SINCE THEIR PEAK ARE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHERE WE ESTIMATED WE HAD FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS WE'RE NOW ESTIMATE THAT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WILL HAVE REDUCED BY AROUND TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND
SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY REINFORCING THE CHALLENGING TIMES AT THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH AND CONTINUES TO GO THROUGH AND OBVIOUSLY IN RELATION TO THE OLD PRICE YES WE'VE STARTED TO SEE THE OIL PRICE GO UP IT'S ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR
BUT TO BE HONEST IN HEATS TO KEEP MOVING UP AND IT NEEDS TO STAY AT A SUSTAINED AND HIGHER LEVEL FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME TO BUILD THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU PREVIOUS CONTRIBUTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT AND THEN START GENERATING THE PROFITS THAT COMPANIES CAN THEN START REINVESTING SO THE CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE AS AS KEY TO THIS INDUSTRY AS THEY ARE TO OTHER INTERESTS RIGHT BUT EVEN IF IT DOES CONTINUE TO RECOVER THE TRUTH IS THAT THE NORTH SEA IS A VERY EXPENSIVE PLACE TO BE EXTRACTING
AND IT HAS BEEN THAT HAS BEEN ITS HISTORY BUT ACTUALLY INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS REALLY BEEN GRIPPING ITS PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF IT'S GOT SPACE WE'VE SEEN EFFICIENCY IMPROVING AND WE'VE SEEN PRODUCTION INCREASE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS AND ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF THEIR FOCUS ON IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN REDUCING COSTS WE ESTIMATE THAT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE'LL SEE A FORTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN OPERATING COSTS
SO THE WHOLE FOCUS WE CAN'T CONTROL THE OIL PRICE WE KNOW THAT BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS ENSURE THAT WE ARE A COMPETITIVE BASIN WE'VE GOT A BASINS GLOBALLY O.K. SO WHERE DO WE THINK THE OIL PRICE IS HEADING AND WHAT MIGHT THAT MEAN FOR JOBS GOING FORWARD ASSUMING THAT ALL COMPANIES ARE MAKING THESE TARTS OR PREDICTIONS SO YES SO WHO WHO KNOWS AND I I'M NOT I DON'T SPECULATE ON THE OLD PRICE OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE THAT THE SUPPLY DEMAND DOES CORRECT ITSELF I DON'T THINK PUNDITS ARE SAYING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON
SO HENCE AGAIN THE FOCUS HAS TO BE YON ENSURING WE WE REINFORCE OUR EMPHASIS AROUND KEEPING A COS TIGHT AND COMPETITIVE AND IMPROVING OUR EFFICIENCY SO THAT INVESTMENT WHICH COMES IN AT A GLOBAL LEVEL THEY LOOK CRIME BUT THE WORLD AND THEY LOOK AT THE U.K. AND THEY THINK THERE'S SOMEWHERE THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR MONEY BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO INVEST
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL THE OIL PRICE WAS PLAYING QUITE A LARGE ROLE IN PERFORMANCE OR LACK THEREOF OF THE MARKETS YESTERDAY POWER JANNA IS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT LONDON AND CAPITAL IS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT IF THE MARKET'S LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE OIL PRICE HAS PROVED INCREDIBLY INFLUENTIAL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS WASN'T IT IN TERMS OF AS I SAY THE PERFORMANCE OF EQUITIES
HE NEEDED SETTING THE TONE EVEN IF AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL EQUITIES MINING OIL RELATED BUSINESSES ARE NOW REPRESENT THE DIBLEY HIGH NEVERTHELESS THEY'RE SETTING THE TONE BECAUSE THE OR PRESENT THE SIGNAL SOME DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE AT THE MUM MARKETS ARE PRETTY MUCH THIS COUNTING THAT THE VERY SHORT TERM FACTORS ARE MOVING OIL PRICE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS
WITH RESPECT FOR HIS NIGERIAN STRIKES ARE DUE TO COME TO AN END THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY MEAN THAT OLD PRIZE MIGHT RESUME ITS ITS DOWNWARD SPIRAL REALLY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WHAT DO YOU MAKE
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE FIGURES ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT BY COMPANIES WHY MIGHT THEY BE IN YOUR VIEW HESITANT TO INVEST IS IT THE PROSPECT OF OF WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM OR IS IT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY ALL THIS VERY UNCERTAIN PICTURE FOR OIL PRICES WHAT IS INFLUENCING MINDS RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S IN THE VERY SHORT TERM IT'S A FAGGOT WE HAVE
AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF GEO POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES STARTING WITH BREAKFAST CONTINUE WITH SPANISH ALEXIS CONTINUING WITH YOU AS ELECTION CONTINUING WITH ITALIAN ELECTIONS THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN A RECENT APPEARED WHERE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WITH POLICY FOR INSTANCE WOULD LOOK LIKE IN SOME OF THE MAJOR BLOCS
YOU CAN BUY THESE WITH THE FACT THAT FROM THAT GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE WE
A RICH STAGFLATION WE'RE LOOKING VERY MUCH LIKE TO JAPAN STORY LOOK LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHERE OUR WESTERN DEMOGRAPHICS ARE POOR AND OUR BUSINESSES AS MEASURED JUST BEFORE A VERY MUCH AND DEMOGRAPHICS WERE EXACTLY WHAT MARRIAGE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WHICH I THOUGHT WHEN HE SPOKE THERE SEEM TO BE A SENSE OF EXASPERATION HE WOULD SEEM TO BE SAYING LOOK I'M RUNNING UP TOOLS IN THE BOX
HE IS THE LAST SHERIFF IN TOWN HE'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY SORT OF ENTITY THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT INTO WITH THE MARKETS BECAUSE WE HAVE
TWO BIG SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY CONSUMERS AND COMPANIES VERY MUCH INCREASING THE SAVINGS RATES VERY CAUTIOUS AND THEN WE HAVE A SECTOR WHICH IS THE PUBLIC SAID THE UNWILLING
OR UNABLE TO REALLY COUNTERACT WITH A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL SPENDING THE LAST SHERIFF IN TOWN IS THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE ONLY THING THEY CAN DO AT THE MOMENT HAS BEEN KEPT INTEREST RATES LOW
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY STARTED BY WOODS ARE VERY IMPORTANT OR SOME DARING IN CORPORATE IF I'M GOING TO ASK YOU FOR A VERY BRIEF SENTENCE ON WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT EMERGE FROM THIS FAST MOVING SOAP OPERA CALLED B.H.S.
I THINK CERTAINLY THERE'S GOING TO BE FURTHER PRESSURE ON MY MY GRIM POLLY WAS IN LONDON THIS WEEK THERE MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME IN THIS COUNTRY COS I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IF IF IF HE HAS TO TO TO STAY FOR A LOT LONGER WAS IMPORTANT HOWEVER IS THAT THESE FURTHER REINFORCES THE FACT THAT
CONSUMERS AND SEE RESULT I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THIS SHERRY IN LOOK OH MY GOD MY PLEASURE MAYBE HE'D WHISK THAT BUT FOR THE PRESSURE ON THE CONSUMER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW FRIDAY IT'S TIME FOR THE FRIDAY BOSS THE IDEA BEING OF COURSE WE GIVE A LEADING INDUSTRY FIGURE JUST A BIT MORE TIME TO TELL US ABOUT THE SECTOR AND THIS MORNING IT IS THE TURN OF DAVID LOCKWOOD THE C.E.O. OF LAIRD TECHNOLOGIES LED GROUP A LEADING BRITISH BASE ELECTRONICS AND TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS AND OF COURSE CONSTITUENT OF THE FOOTSIE TOO FIFTY GOOD MORNING TO YOU DAVID LOCKWOOD LET ME ASK YOU FIRST BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WHAT YOUR COMPANY DOES
GOOD MORNING TANYA AFTER LISTENING TO YOUR LAST THREE GUESTS DO YOU THINK WE ARE VERY LUCKY SO WE OPERATE IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IN THE CONNECTIVITY SECTOR AND WE REALLY DO TWO THINGS WE PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY WERE THE DEVICES EVERYONE RELIES ON TO WORK SO SMARTPHONES TABLETS AND SO ON AND THEN WE MAKE THE CONNECTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PROVIDER OF SHOTS AND ANTENNAS YOU'LL SEE ON CARS
BIGGEST ARE MOST GLOBAL SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY OF YOUR LISTENERS COULD GET FROM HOME TO WORK WITHOUT USING A TECHNOLOGY RIGHT LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT DRIVERLESS CARS THIS IS AN AREA OF MUCH INTEREST AT THE MOMENT IT'S STILL FEELS VERY FUTURISTIC BUT WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU IS IS HOW THE TRANSITION MIGHT BE MADE BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY INVOLVED IN THIS OF COURSE YOU BROUGHT A COMPANY IN GERMANY SO WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION AS TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE THROWN UP BY THE TRANSITION IF WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT OVER WHAT PERIOD TO DRIVERLESS CARS
SO I THINK IT WILL BE A TRANSITION IT WON'T BE A STEP FUNCTION WE WILL SEE A GROWTH OF CONNECTIVITY MORE AND MORE SERVICES IN THE CAR THE CAR AT THE HOME OFFICE AND SO ON I WILL SEE MORE AND MORE DRIVER ASSIST BY TWENTY TWENTY MOST PEOPLE THINK THERE WILL BE DEMONSTRATED DRIVERLESS CARS ON THE ROAD AS A MASS TRANSPORT PROBABLY MORE LIKE MID TWENTY THIRTIES
SO SOME VERY SERIOUS QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE THROWN UP IN THE INTERIM AND THAT IS HOW DRIVERLESS CARS INTERACT WITH NON DRIVERLESS CARS ARE ONES THAT ARE DRIVEN HOW DRIVER MIGHT ENGAGE HAVING DISENGAGED AND ALSO WHAT DECISIONS THEY MIGHT MAKE IN WHEN THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR A COLLISION
THIS IS QUITE AN INTERESTING MORAL ISSUES AND YOU OF COURSE COME FROM A MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND ARE YOU A CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT TOO SO YOU'VE HAD TO ENGAGE IN A LOT OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW SOCIETY CHANGES SO THE SOCIAL SCIENCES SO I SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE
THE TIME LINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS DRIVEN BY THE SOCIAL SCIENCE IS NOT TECHNICAL SCIENCES WILL BE MUCH MORE READY FOR FOUR IT TECHNICALLY THEN WE WILL SOCIAL SOCIETY WHY IT'S SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A CAR HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HITTING A SCHOOL BUS WHICH HAS JUST BLOWN A TYRE
FOR KILLING A CYCLIST AND THAT'S THE ONLY TWO CHOICES ARE WE PREPARED TO LET A MACHINE MAKE THAT CHOICE OR ARE WE ALLOWED TO PROGRAM HER OWN MORAL CHOICES INTO A CAR FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN LONDON YOU HAVE A THING ABOUT CYCLISTS DO YOU LOAD IT IN YOUR OWN WAY DAVID LOCKWOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH

SCIENTISTS IN CANADA HER FOUND FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS THE THERAPY INVOLVES THE USE OF POWERFUL CHEMOTHERAPY TO COMPLETELY DESTROY IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS THEN REBUILT WITH STEM CELLS THE STUDY SHOWED ENCOURAGING RESULTS BUT IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SIGNIFICANT RISKS ONE OF THE TWENTY FOUR PATIENTS DIED
THREE DAYS OF CELEBRATIONS FOR THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL NINETIETH BIRTHDAY START THIS MORNING WITH A NATIONAL SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING AT SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL TODAY IS ALSO PRINCE PHILIP'S NINETY FIFTH BIRTHDAY
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE FIRST OF THE HEAD TO HEAD DEBATES LAST NIGHT AT LEAST THE FIRST TIME THEY'D SHARED A PLATFORM ON TELEVISION DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BORIS JOHNSON TRIED TO MAKE IMMIGRATION THE STORY OF THE NIGHT FOR VOGUE LEAVE ON THE STREETS OF A CITY ON THE STREETS
BECAUSE OF THE EUROPEAN JUDGES THERE ARE TERRORISTS AND MURDERERS AND VERY SERIOUS CRIMINALS THAT WE CANNOT DEPORT BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN COURT IS TAKING CONTROL OVER THAT KIND OF QUESTION I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT CONTROL THANK YOU
AMBER RUDD FOUR REMAIN ACCUSED MY JOHNSON OF HAVING A HIDDEN AGENDA
THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM THERE ISN'T A SILVER BULLET AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT BORIS AND HIS TEAM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ALTHOUGH I FEAR THE ONLY NUMBER THAT BORIS IS INTERESTED IN IS THE ONE THAT SAYS NUMBER TWO
TALBOT IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WHAT APART FROM ALL THAT TOLD THE STORY TODAY IS PROBABLY LABOUR ISN'T IT IT IS I MEAN STRIKING IN THAT DEBATE LAST NIGHT HOW YOU KNOW THE SORT OF SO CALLED BLUE ON BLUE STUFF JUST CONTINUED AND YOU HEARD AMBER ROD THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON'S PRIME MINISTERIAL AMBITIONS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IT IS NOT JUST THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT IS ODDS WITH THE AT ODDS WITH ITSELF DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF COURSE THE LABOUR
HAS DIVISIONS NOW THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WE KNOW IS OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOUR OF A REMAIN VOTE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT A REALLY SORT OF OUTSPOKEN CRITIQUE THIS MORNING BY JOHN
THE LABOUR M.P. FOR BASSETT LAW HE WAS SAYING LOOK THIS IS A SORT OF WESTMINSTER ELITE BUBBLE ISSUE WE JUST DO NOT GET IT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDLANDS IN THE NORTH A TRADITIONAL BASE WHERE IMMIGRATION IS SUCH AN ISSUE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE AND SHOULD VOTE IN HIS VIEW FOR LEAVE AND THIS ON TOP OF ANDY BURNHAM THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY SAYING ON NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT BUT HE THINKS THERE IS OF A VERY REAL PROSPECT LEAVE WILL WIN BECAUSE OF ALL THIS BECAUSE HE
FEARS LABOUR ISN'T TALKING TO THAT HEARTLAND SUPPORT SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE OF THIS TODAY ED MILIBAND'S COMING OUT TRYING TO SAY WELL HOLD ON A MINUTE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THERE WAS A BRECK'S IT BECAUSE IN HIS VIEW IS LOOKING AT THE IFE S. FIGURES INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYING THAT THEY COULD BE A RECESSION AFTER BRECK SAID AND IT WOULD BE LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE SO WHAT IS IT DO YOU THINK THAT IS IF WHAT IF THIS IS THE RIGHT WORD APPEALING TO LABOUR VOTERS OVER THEIR HEADS
OF THEIR LEADERS IS OF IMMIGRATION WAS CERTAINLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES I THINK IT IS IT'S STRIKING JOHN I WAS ON THE THE LABOUR IN BATTLE BUS WITH ALAN JOHNSON WHO HEADS THAT CAMPAIGN DOWN IN CORNWALL FOR A TIME LAST WEEK AND WE WERE IN A TOWN CALLED CAMBORNE AND MY JOHNSON WAS GIVING A STUMP SPEECH I MEAN I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK VIRTUALLY NO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TURNED UP THESE WERE ALL REMAIN ACTIVIST LABOUR SUPPORTERS
AND A FISHERMAN SHOWED UP A CORNISH FISHERMAN WHO REALLY VIGOROUSLY HECKLED HIM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE FISHING QUOTAS AND IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME HE'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF PERSON THAT LABOUR SHOULD BE APPEALING TO IN ALL THIS AND YET THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE GETTING THAT MESSAGE ACROSS AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY FROM PEOPLE LIKE TOM WATSON FROM
FROM ED MILLIBAND AND SO ON IS A REAL ATTEMPT TO TRY AND DRIVE THAT MESSAGE HOME I THINK THEY SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT WITH PERHAPS MORE MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND THEY CAN PUSH THE POSITIVES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT MESSAGE WILL GET ACROSS I THINK THEY FEEL THAT THEY STILL HAVE A CHALLENGE REALLY IN APPEALING TO THOSE MORE TRADITIONAL LOWER INCOME PAST THE NORTH AND THE MIDLANDS AND IN TERMS OF GETTING THAT MESSAGE ACROSS AND GETTING ACROSS A MESSAGE THAT APPEALS TO THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IMMIGRATION TOM THANKS A LOT BE TALKING TO ED MILIBAND OR TEN PAST EIGHT
TWENTY TWO MINUTES NOW SEVEN AND A MILLION FOREIGN FANS ARE EXPECTED TO COME HERE TO FRANCE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TWO AND A HALF MILLION WILL BE INSIDE THE TEN STADIUMS HOSTING GAMES IT SHOULD BE A MOMENT OF CELEBRATION FOR FRANCE ESPECIALLY AS THE NATIONAL SIDE OF THE BOOKIES' FAVOURITE TO WIN AND YET LUCY WILLIAMSON
IS A PARIS CORRESPONDENT AND YET I MEAN ECONOMIC STAGNATION STRIKES THREATS OF ATTACKS FLOODS ONLY LAST WEEK HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERISE THE NATIONAL MOOD IT'S TRICKY I THINK WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE HERE THERE IS EXCITEMENT THE NATIONAL TEAM IS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE FRANCE REALLY NEEDS A FEELGOOD MOMENT AT THE MOMENT
BUT IT'S VERY MUTED I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PAPERS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN PUBLIC THERE'S A LOT OF FOOTBALL IT'S JUST NOT REALLY ABOUT THE FOOTBALL IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT LOGISTICS OR IT'S ABOUT SECURITY RISKS AND SO I THINK AT THE FOREFRONT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS IS THAT FEAR IS IS IT GOING TO GO O.K.
AND IS IT A FEAR OF THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT WALKING AROUND HERE YESTERDAY EVENING I TALK TO HER JUST A HANDFUL OF FRENCH PEOPLE AND AND I SAID DO YOU HAVE IN THE BACK OF YOUR MINDS THE ATTACKS FROM LAST NOVEMBER FROM LAST YEAR AND THEY SAID WELL ACTUALLY WE DO ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT GOING TO NOT COME OUT
YEAH I THINK THE OPENING GAME TONIGHT AT THE STUD THE FAIENCE IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY POIGNANT MOMENT COS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE REMEMBERING ANOTHER GETTING IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS
BUNDLED OUT OF THE STADIUM AND THREE SUICIDE BOMBERS WERE BLOWING THEMSELVES UP OUTSIDE SO I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO REMEMBER THAT NIGHT AND THIS I THINK THIS TOURNAMENT IS A REALLY BIG TEST FOR FRANCE IF IT CAN PULL IT OFF AND IT GOES PEACEFULLY AND HE GOES WELL THAT'S GOING TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE FEEL THAT SENSE OF SECURITY THAT HAS BEEN GONE HERE IT'S ACTUALLY SINCE LAST YEAR
WHAT SORT OF SECURITY PREPARATIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR THEY'VE GOT MORE PEOPLE ON THE STREET HERE THEY'VE GOT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SECURITY PERSONNEL ON THE STREETS THAT SOLDIERS THAT'S POLICE THAT SECURITY GUARDS BUT DESPITE THAT THERE ARE YOU CAN TELL THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF NERVOUSNESS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SECURITY AROUND FANS ZONES THE GOVERNMENT'S JUST SAID THAT BARS AND RESTAURANTS CAN'T SCREEN
THE GAMES ON TELEVISION SCREENS OUTSIDE THE BARS AND RESTAURANTS IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO SECURE THAT THE INTERIOR MINISTER AND SAID LOOK WE'RE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS BUT YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ZERO RISK AND YET THE FRONT PAGES ARE LESS FULL OF THE SECURITY THREAT AND MORE TALKING ABOUT THE STRIKES AIR FRANCE ON STRIKE TOMORROW FOR A FEW DAYS S.N.C.F. THE NATIONAL RAIL OPERATOR THREATENING STRIKES PARISIAN TRANSPORT WORKERS THREATENING STRIKES THE FANS GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND THE COUNTRY CAN THE GAP AND GO FROM GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED
I THINK AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF THAT COS THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH FRANCE SHOULD BE UNIFIED PULLING TOGETHER AT THE MOMENT AND THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT ACTUALLY THESE ARE GOING TO PERHAPS DISRUPT THE PROCEDURE'S A LITTLE BIT I MEAN THE RAILWAY IS THE FART THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS ARE PRETTY MUCH THERE BUT EIGHTY PER CENT ARE NOW RUNNING O.K. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S AN AIR FRANCE STRIKE KICKING IN BIN MEN ARE PREVENTING THAT RUBBISH FROM BEING COLLECTED IN THE STREETS OF PARIS AND MARSEILLE SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NOTICE ALL RIGHT LUCY WILLIAMSON A PARIS CORRESPONDENT THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NINETY MINUTES SEVEN LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THEY ALL REFLECT ON THE LECTURES FROM SIR JOHN MAJOR AND TONY BLAIR
IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN TELLING AS VOTERS NEED NO LECTURES
FROM THEM THE TWO FORMER PRIME MINISTERS TOLD AN AUDIENCE THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD BE AN HISTORIC MISTAKE THAT COULD TEAR APART THE U.K. I THINK
USE TEN DENTURES GIVES INSUFFICIENT CREDIT TO THE POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENTS FORGED IN NORTHERN IRELAND DURING THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE MALE PICTURES THE TWO MEN BENEATH THE HEADLINE GOOD GRIEF THEY MUST BE DESPERATE IN THE TIMES CARTOON AND JOWLY SIR JOHN INTONING WRECKS IT WILL DESTROY OUR GREAT COUNTRY HAS HIS SENTENCE FINISHED BY RED EYED MY
IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT FINANCIAL TIMES AGREES WITH THEM THAT THE RETURN OF A HARD FRONTIER BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK FOR THE PEACE PROCESS IT WOULD BE AN IMMENSE PRICE TO PAY FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION EXCESS
THE TIMES LEADS ON THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TREATMENT TRIAL IN CANADA REPORTING THAT SCIENTISTS ARE CLOSE TO A CURE IT SAYS THE PROGRESSION OF THE DEEP BILL TOTING DISEASE HALTED IN ALMOST ALL THE TWENTY FOUR PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT AGGRESSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY COMBINED WITH A TRANSPLANT OF THEIR OWN CELLS THE GUARDIAN ALSO LEADS ON THE TRIAL RESULTS SAYING THE RADICAL AND RISKY STEM CELL THERAPY OFFERS HOPE
THE RESULTS WILL LEAD TO A WORLDWIDE CLAMOUR FOR THE TRANSPLANTS TO BE WIDELY AVAILABLE THE PAPER SAYS THE MALE HAS A PICTURE OF SIR PHILIP GREEN ON ITS FRONT PAGE LOOKING IN ITS WORDS HAUNTED AND UNSHAVEN THE HEADLINE SAYS STRIP SO SHIFTY OF HIS TITLE
REPORTS THAT ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS RELEASED BY M. PIECE OF FILLET DODGED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIABILITIES OF B.H.S. WHEN HE SOLD THEM HOW COLLAPSED BUSINESS LAST YEAR THE MIRROR SO AS A GROUP OF TORY M.P.S WILL TELL SIR PHILIP NEXT WEEK TO COUGH UP SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS TO COVER THE B.H.S. PENSIONS BLACK
THE TELEGRAPH PICTURES SIX NEW BORN BABIES LYING ON A SINGLE BED IN THE HOSPITAL IN ALEPPO IN SYRIA SUMMER WEARING BANDAGES AND FEEDING TUBES THE PAPER SAYS THEY WERE ALL TAKEN OUT OF INCUBATORS AS BOMBS DROPPED BY SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WARPLANES FELL OUTSIDE
THE GUARDIAN HAS INTERVIEWED ANG HELL SUSSED THE SPANISH JOURNALIST RELEASED IN MAY BY AN AFFILIATE AFTER BEING HELD HOSTAGE FOR TEN MONTHS IN SYRIA THE MEDIA HAVE TO COMMIT TO PUTTING REPORTERS ON THE GROUND HE SAYS BECAUSE WARS WITHOUT WITNESSES ARE THE WORST KIND OF WARS KELVIN MACKENZIE IN THE CENTRE'S CALL ME OLD FASHIONED BUT HE WAS QUITE SHOCKED TO SEE THAT TATTOOED FIGURE OF THE ENGLAND RUGBY WINGER JACK NO OR MOST OF HIS UPPER BODY IS COVERED BY A VAST JAPANESE DESIGN
YOU LOOK LIKE IN THIRTY YEARS' TIME THE TIMES REPORTED THAT THE SURGING POPULARITY OF BODY ART HAS PROMPTED
THE U.S. MARINE CORPS TO WRITE A NEW COMPREHENSIVE THIRTY TWO PAGE TATTOO POLICY TATTOOS ARE BANNED FROM KNEES AND ELBOWS HEADS AND NECKS AND FROM THE FIRST TWO INCHES OF THE WRIST SO THE MARINES CAN MAINTAIN A SHAFT
PERSONAL APPEARANCE WHICH IS OF COURSE WHAT WE ALWAYS MAINTAINED ON THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAMME SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING SENIOR LABOUR POLITICIANS ARE GIVING WHAT THEY ARE CALLING THEIR STARQUEST WARNING YET TO THEIR SUPPORTERS ABOUT THE RISKS OF A BRICK SIT VOTE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM
THE DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS TO VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM PAST MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT EMERGENCY LEGISLATION TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME WAS RUSHED THROUGH PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY AFTER PROBLEMS WITH AN OFFICIAL WEBSITE HERE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
ON TUESDAY NIGHT PEOPLE RUSHING TO BETA MIDNIGHT DEADLINE WERE THWARTED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO APPLY TO REGISTER TO VOTE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE CRASHED THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER OLIVER LETWIN THE MINISTER IN CHARGE OF THE CABINET OFFICE SAID MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD APPLIED TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE HOUR BEFORE THINGS WENT WRONG
I'M NOT A TECHNICAL EXPERT ON COMPUTER OR BUT I'M ADVISED BY THOSE INSIDE THE CABINET OFFICE AND THE GOVERNMENT DIGITAL SERVICE SO FAR AS THEY CAN MAKE OUT THERE WAS NO UNTOWARD EVENT WHATSOEVER
THERE WAS SIMPLY AN INCAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM TO HANDLE VATS NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS HE SAID THE SYSTEM HADN'T BEEN DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THAT SORT OF DEMAND SO IT WAS NOT IN RETROSPECT SURPRISING THAT IT FELL OVER
A LIB DEM FORMER MINISTER TOM BREAK SAID ONE OF THE BIG BUGBEARS PEOPLE HAD WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM WASN'T THEY HAD TO REGISTER TO VOTE SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF AN ELECTION I'M VERY PLEASED THE GOVERNMENT HAVE NOW FOUND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHORTEN THAT PERIOD IS IT THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION
BUT PERHAPS FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS THERE MAY ALSO BE A SHORTER PERIOD SOAKS IT TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME TO REGISTER IN ADVANCE A FUTURE MUCH
LABOUR'S SPOKESMAN WAYNE DAVID SAID HE'D BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY THE REACTION FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IT IS SAID BY SUN BUT THIS STARTED THE SPENT IS DISPROPORTION
OTHERS IN THE BOARD LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAVE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT THE REGISTRATION SAFE WAS DELIBERATELY CRASHED TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE FOR EXTENDING THE REGISTRATION
THE S.N.P. STEPHEN GETHIN'S SAID HIS PARTY BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS WERE IN THERE IN THE FINAL STRAIGHT TWO WEEKS UNTIL THE REFERENDUM BUT I WANT TO GIVE THE MINISTER ALL SHOW US THAT THERE WILL BE A POST MATCH ANALYSIS ON THIS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LESSONS
WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE PAST FORTY EIGHT
I WAS THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY LIAM FOX SAID HE'D BEEN VERY SURPRISED THAT THE WEBSITE HAD CRASHED WHY DID THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION NOT MAKE THE SUFFICIENT
ARRANGEMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SYSTEM COULD ACTUALLY
WITH THE DEMAND AND HOW DO WE KNOW BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN IF WE HAVE ANOTHER DEADLINE TONIGHT HOW DO WE DO THE SYSTEM WOULD CRASH IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY OLIVER LETWIN SAID THE WEBSITE NOW HAD A LARGER CAPACITY SO WE WOULD NOW HAVE TO HAVE ABOUT SIX TIMES AS MUCH AS HAPPENED AT THE GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE IT CRASHED AGAIN A VERY PROFOUNDLY HOPE IT ISN'T
SUE WAS A SPEAKER DO WE
THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE BERNARD JENKIN SAID VOTE LEAVE WELCOMED THE SURGE OF PEOPLE APPLYING TO REGISTER TO VOTE BUT HE SUGGESTED THAT EXTENDING THE DEADLINE NOW THAT POSTAL VOTING WAS UNDER WAY WAS ON THE CUSP OF LEGALITY
IF WE SAW THIS HAPPENING IN SOME FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY IN FORMER SOVIET UNION OR AFRICA
WHAT WOULD WE HAVE OBSERVERS SAY ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THIS PAUL THIS IS A REALLY UNPLEASANT PRECEDENT TO BE SETTING IN A SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE ONE OF THE FINEST DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD
BUT A LABOUR M.P. KEVIN JONES SUGGESTED BERNARD JENKIN AND THE LEAF CAMPAIGN OR TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATERS ONLY DOESN'T ANY CREDIT TRYING TO RUBBISH THIS
A FRIEND EVEN BEFORE IT STARTS NEWSON HIGHLY EMOTIVE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN USED IN TERMS OF REFERRING TO THIS PROCESS THAT WOULD BE QUESTIONABLE IN SOME TYPE OF DEVELOP STATE DON'T GIVE HIS VERY HELPFUL AT ALL
M.P.S WENT ON TO APPROVE THE PLANS TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE WITHOUT A VOTE AND A FEW HOURS LATER THE PROPOSALS BECAME LAW WHEN THE HOUSE OF LORDS GAVE ITS APPROVAL BUT IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE APPLYING TO VOTE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH GOVERNMENT WEBSITE
SOME PEERS HAVE FOUND THEY CAN'T INCLUDE THEIR HONOURS AND TITLES WHEN THEY FILL OUT FORMS ON OFFICIAL SITES AND IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNMENT WEBSITE A LIB DEM LAW TYLER REVEALED THAT BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION HE'D COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT AND I COMPLETELY BAKE CORRECTLY I KEPT RECEIVING THIS IS DIRECTED TO MISTER LORD UTHER
A FORMER HEAD OF THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE THE CROSS BENCH OR INDEPENDENT PEER LORD RIGHT ALSO SPOKE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
NUMBERING FROM HER PAST EXISTENCE GRIFFEY FEMALE EXPERIENCE OF ADDRESSING ENVELOPES TO LORD MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMA
AND I SUGGEST THE CHI AFTERNOON'S WEATHER DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ADVISED PERHAPS TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF AWARDS
SO EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO GONGS AND MEDALS IT SEEMS YOU CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING SEAN CURRAN REPORTING YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT OVER ON LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO
TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WE ALL KNOW THE N.H.S. HAS MONEY PROBLEMS NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD BY ONE OF THE LEADING HEALTH SERVICE THINK TANKS WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE EVEN MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN IT NIGEL EDWARDS IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NUFFIELD TRUST WHY DO YOU COME TO THAT CONCLUSION
WE'VE PULLED A PANEL OF HEALTH LEADERS AND IT REALLY GIVES THE PICTURE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF OTHER EVIDENCE THAT THAT WERE A COMBINATION OF WORKLOAD ANXIETY ABOUT THE FINANCIAL POSITION WITH THEIR OWN ORGANISATION IN THE N.H.S. MORE GENERALLY AND THIS GROWING FEEDING AT THE N.H.S. IS UNDER SEA SEEMS TO BE HAVING AN EFFECT ON STAFF IS NOT SO SURPRISING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD
ARE CHARACTERISED BY HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND THE BULLYING IF YOU LAYER ON THAT BULLY BUT THEY SEEM TO BE A FEATURE OF HIERARCHIES ARE WITH THE STRESS THAT'S INVOLVED IN PROVIDING HEALTHCARE DOES SEEM TO BE IN ISSUE THIRTY PER CENT TO STAFF REPORT THERE'RE THAT THEY'RE BULLIED BULLIED AT WORK AND WE'VE GOT IN THE N.H.S. AN EXTRA LAYER OF INSPECTION AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT WHICH I THINK ADDS TO IT ADDS TO THAT CULTURE WHICH IS WHICH IS PARTICULARLY AN ISSUE AT THE MOMENT AS WHOM MUCH MANAGEMENT
IT'S NOT REALLY MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY I THINK IN FACT THE STAFF SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT AT THAT THEM THE MANAGERS ARE AS MUCH CAUGHT IN THIS SYSTEM AND I DOING QUITE A BIT TO PROTECT THE STAFF SO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A GENERAL CULTURE ISSUE I THINK SOME OF THIS SOME OF THE STEMS FROM THE TOP MICHAEL WEST EMINENT PSYCHOLOGIST HE LOOKS HIS ISSUE SAYS BULLYING SPREADS FIVE TO SIX LEVELS DOWN THE ORGANISATION DOWN ORGANISATIONS
THERE'S NOT BUT IT'S NOT JUST PULLING I THINK THE REAL ISSUE THAT COMES OUT FROM WHAT WE HEAR HIS WORKLOAD HAS BEEN GOING UP THE STAFFING NUMBERS HAVE NOT PAY AS BEING KAT THERE'S A GENERAL SORT OF FEELING THAT STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN VALUED AND I THINK HER ANOTHER CONCERN OBVIOUSLY IS THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT THAT WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY WITH THE WITH IT WITH THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AND A GENERAL ATMOSPHERE THAT'S INCREASINGLY STAFF FEEL UNDER STRESS
PERHAPS NOT AS OVERSTRESSED OVIS OVIS OVERSTRESSED UNDERVALUED AND I'VE GOT A SIGNAL I DO THINK THAT THE RIGHT WAY AT THEIR LOCAL MANAGERS ACTUALLY SEEM TO BE DOING QUITE A GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AFTER THEM BUT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S MORE TO DO BUT I THINK THE BIG THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE N.H.S. AS A SORT OF TOTAL ORGANISATION IS IF YOU LOSE THEIR CONNECTION WITH YOUR STAFF IF THEY
IF THEY FEEL THAT ACTUALLY WE'RE BETTER OFF WORKING FOR AN AGENCY AND COME TO WORK WHEN WE FEEL LIKE IT I DO FEEL LIKE I WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING AROUND ME ONCE YOU'VE LOST THAT YOU'VE REALLY LOST SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY
TIRED ANY MASSIVE ORGANISATION AND CERTAINLY THE N.H.S. AS A MASSIVE ORGANISATION YOU'LL FIND MAYOR MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE SAY BURRELL ALI IS AT ROCK BOTTOM IT'S THAT IT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE BEAST YES I MEAN WHEN I JOIN THE N.H.S. I WAS TOLD THAT MORALE WAS AT AN ALL TIME EXACT AND THEY WANT US WONDER WHAT APPOINTMENT AT THAT THAT THAT THAT STOPS BEING THE JOKING THAT MAYBE NOW AND THE RIG THING THAT HAS CAUSED THAT THE SINGLE THING THAT'S CAUSE THAT I THINK IS THAT IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS IT'S THE IT'S THE
PROBABLY BLOWN AND I HEALTH LEAVES PANEL RE EMPHASISES ITS THE WORKLOAD THE POPULATION IS GETTING OLDER AND SICKER AND IT'S GROWING AND THAT THAT HAS REALLY NOT BEEN KEPT UP WITH I SUSPECT IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF STAFF AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN NO IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A FINANCIAL PROBLEM AND NEED TO PUT BACK MORE STAFF IN ONTO THE WARDS TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS AN INCREASINGLY SICK INDEPENDENT POPULATION NIGEL EDWARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S COMING UP TO SEVEN MINUTES TO SERVE AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE START OF A MONTH OF CELEBRATIONS HERE IN FRANCE FOR THE FOOTBALL IT IS ALSO OF COURSE THE START OF THREE DAYS OF CELEBRATIONS FOR THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH BIRTHDAY HER ACTUAL BIRTHDAY WAS IN APRIL MAKING THIS HER SECOND BIRTHDAY OF THE YEAR OF COURSE THE QUEEN
DOES HAVE TWO BIRTHDAYS EVERY YEAR BUT IN LIGHT OF HER NINETIETH WE'VE BEEN ASKING CHILDREN AROUND THE WORLD WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY HAD TWO BIRTHDAYS AND THESE CHILDREN ARE IN SWEATER

EAT LET'S HAVE CAKE
THERE YOU GO JOHN YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO BIRTHDAYS THAT EAST WERE TELLING MILTON AND CO IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN SOWETO SOUTH AFRICA YOU CAN SEE WHERE THEY COME IN AT SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IS ONE OF THOSE HIDEOUS DISEASES THAT'S DEFIED THE BEST ATTEMPTS OF SCIENTISTS TO FIND ANYTHING RESEMBLING A CURE BUT NOW AT LAST THERE ARE SIGNS THEY MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO STOP IT GETTING WORSE DOCTOR
HIS CONSULTANT NEUROLOGIST AT KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL WHERE HE SET UP THERE AN M.S. SO THIS MORNING TO YOU MORNING JOHN SO NOT A CURE WHAT WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WE'VE GOT IS AN IMMUNE SYSTEM WHERE A BODY'S OWN IMMUNE CELLS INSTEAD OF FIGHTING BACTERIA OR VIRUSES ARE MAKING A MISTAKE AND THEY'RE DAMAGING
PARTS OF THE BRAIN AND THE SPINAL CORD AND WE'VE GOT SOME TREATMENTS THAT CAN STOP THESE FLARE UPS BUT SOMETIMES THE TREATMENTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AND IN THIS PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE GROUP OF PATIENTS WHO FAILED THE EXISTING DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIES THEY THEN OFFERED THEM STEM CELL THERAPY ARE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS GIVEN THEM VERY POWERFUL CHEMOTHERAPY DESTROYED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEN TRANSPLANTED BACK THE BODY'S OWN STEM CELLS AND BY DOING THAT THEY'VE STABILISED THE DISEASE IN ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT OF CASES
KILLED OFF ONE LOT OF BAD CELLS AND REPLACED HIM WITH ANOTHER LOT OF GOOD SELL EXACTLY THE SAME AS WE WOULD MANAGE A POSTING WITH THE SEVERE BLOOD CANCER AND ARE USING THE SAME TECHNIQUES BUT IT COMES WITH THE SAME RISKS AS IF YOU'RE MANAGING THE SORTS OF PATIENT AH HOW RISKY WELL THEY WERE TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE ONLY OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD SO THEY HAD TO SELECT THEIR PATIENTS
VERY VERY CAREFULLY SO IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE GROUP OF PATIENTS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE AND OUT OF THIS TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE ONE PERSON UNFORTUNATELY DIED OF LIVER FAILURE ANOTHER ONE LANDED UP WITH CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT BUT THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME VERY VERY EARLY ANYWAY SO THESE WERE PATIENTS WHO ARE LIKELY TO HAVE BECOME ILL BASED ON OUR MODELS AND BASED ON OUR PREDICTIONS AND THEY'VE BEEN SELECTED THEM AND SAID YOUR DISEASES LOOKING BAD YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN ON THERAPIES WE'RE OFFERING YOU THIS THERAPY
AND PEOPLE THEN CHOSE TO GO ON TO TREATMENT YES RIGHT SO PEOPLE WITH THEE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF M.S. I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHEN THEY HEAR YOU THIS MORNING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE SAY A GREAT
IT'S HAD ITS CURE WHAT I CAN NOW GO ON GET SOME PRITPAL AND THE DISEASE WON'T DEVELOP IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE EXCELLENT DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIES THERE ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING REMITTING DISEASE AND I'M GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR RELAPSES BUT IN PEOPLE WITH MORE SEVERE DISEASE WHO HAVING MAUDE RELAPSES OR HAVING RELAPSES DESPITE THESE THERAPIES THIS OFFERS ANOTHER THERAPY THAT WE CAN ADD ON AND WE WERE ALREADY OFFERING IT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE BUT SEVERE BREAKTHROUGH DISEASE
AS A RISK YOU THERAPY AND IS IT POSSIBLE THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THIS TREATMENT CAN BE DEVELOPED SO THAT EVENTUALLY
WE ARE ABLE TO STOP THE DISEASE IN ITS TRACKS I THINK IT OFFERS POTENTIAL I THINK IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS FOR US TO BE CERTAIN BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL IN TIME THAT IF WE CAN TREAT THE DISEASE VERY EARLY AND POTENTIALLY AGGRESSIVELY WE MAY BE ABLE TO STOP IT IN THIS IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RIGHT SO THIS WITH SOME CAVEATS THIS IS REALLY GOOD NEWS THERE IS THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF OPTIMISM THAT WE NEED TO ADD SOME CAUTION TO THAT AS WELL BUT HE REALISED SILVER OF KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH

REFERENDUM PARTY'S MAKES A FRESH APPEAL TO ITS SUPPORTERS TO GET BEHIND THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN
THE EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IS OPENING IN FRANCE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND ENHANCED SECURITY AND THE TEACHING OFFERED TO THE BRIGHTEST PUPILS IN ENGLAND STATE SCHOOLS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A NATIONAL SCANDAL TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS DIANA SPEED
SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES ATTENDING THE PARTY SUPPORTERS THAT THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WILL BE HIT BY TAX RISES SPENDING CUTS AND A WATERING DOWN OF WORKERS' RIGHTS OF BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. THEY'RE MAKING THE WARNING AS THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM CRITICISED LABOUR'S CAMPAIGNING IN THE REFERENDUM HE SAID IT WAS FAILING TO GET THROUGH TO THE PARTY'S TRADITIONAL VOTERS AND THERE REMAIN SIDE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING DEFEATED HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WHAT
LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON AND SHADOW CABINET COLLEAGUES WOULD SUGGEST THIS MORNING THAT AN EMERGENCY BUDGET WOULD BE NECESSARY IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WILL PRESENT THEIR OWN ANALYSIS OF FIGURES FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SUGGESTING THAT EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF SPENDING CUTS AND TAX RISES WOULD BE IN THE PIPELINE AND LABOUR VOTERS FACE FURTHER SHOCK THERAPY FROM THE PARTY'S FORMER LEADER ED MILIBAND WHO WANTS SEPARATELY THAT THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD MOVE TO THE RATE AFTER BREAK
AND RIDGES WORKERS' RIGHTS PORT LEAVE SAY THE CLAIMS ARE FANCIFUL AND DESCRIBE SUCH TACTICS AS PROJECT FEAR BUT IN TRUTH IT SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES WHO ARE CURRENTLY VERY WORRIED
BY TALKING WITH ELECTION AGENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY'VE BEEN DISCOVERING IT FAR MORE OF THEIR SUPPORTERS ARE PREPARED TO BACK BRAKES IT THAN THE DENTISTS ARE PITTED AND A NEWSNIGHT THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM EVEN RAISED THE PROSPECT OF DEFEAT FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN FAR TOO MUCH
AND NOT ENOUGH HOLE IN RECENT TIMES WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT HERE WE ARE TWO WEEKS AWAY
FROM THE VERY REAL PROSPECT THAT BRITAIN WILL VOTE
ISOLATION THAT'S HOW I SEE THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE LABOUR M.P. JOHN MANN AND THE LEFT WINGER DENNIS SKINNER HAVE DECLARED THEIR BACKING FOR BREAKS AT THE SPAWNING SETTING CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION MY MIND HAD SUGGESTED WESTMINSTER WOULD BE SHOCKED TO LEARN JUST HOW MANY MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY WILL ALSO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE ENERGY SECRETARY AMBER RUDD HAS ACCUSED HER CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUE BORIS JOHNSON OF PUTTING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN ORDER TO FURTHER HIS AMBITION TO BE PRIME MINISTER SHE MADE THE COMMENT IN A TELEVISED DEBATE INVOLVING SIX POLITICIANS THREE FROM EACH SIDE ON I. T. V. LAST NIGHT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG WAS WATCHING THE OUTERS WERE ALL ON THE SAME SCRIPT
THERE REMAIN AT ALL HAD ONE TARGET BORIS JOHNSON WHO WAS REPEATEDLY ACCUSED EVEN BY HIS COLLEAGUE AMBER RUDD OF BEING MORE INTERESTED IN HIS OWN AMBITION IN THE REFERENDUM THIS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM THERE ISN'T A SILVER BULLET AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT BORIS AND HIS TEAM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS ALTHOUGH I FEAR THE ONLY NUMBER THAT BORIS IS INTERESTED IN IS THE ONE THAT SAYS NUMBER TEN I'M MASSIVELY PRO IMMIGRATION I'M THE DESCENDANT OF TUCKS AND VERY PROUD OF IT TOO
THERE'S GOT TO BE DEMOCRATIC CONSENT FOR THE SCALE OF THE FLOWS THAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IT'S CORROSIVE OF TRUST IN DEMOCRACY THE CENTRAL DISPUTE SWEAR ALL REHEARSED
THE AD CAMPAIGN ATTACKED FOR NOT SPELLING OUT A PRECISE VISION OF HOW THE ECONOMY WOULD BE AFFECTED IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. THERE ARE MAIN CAMP ACCUSED OF FILLING VOTERS WITH FEAR ABOUT WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IMMIGRATION A CONSTANT THEME
BOTH SIDES INEVITABLY PERHAPS CLAIMED VICTORY WITHIN MINUTES BUT WHILE REMAIN CLEARLY TRIED TO DIMINISH THE OUT CAMPS BIGGEST FIGURE BORIS JOHNSON
DESPITE TWO HOURS OF BAD TEMPERS THE DYNAMICS OF THE CAMPAIGN STAY THE SAME

THE MOST DIFFICULT THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FACE
GERMANY AND POLAND AND UKRAINE GETTING TO APPALLING GIVES THE BIGGEST WORRY I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST WE TRAVEL WE'VE GOT A HALF LIFE LAID ON SATURDAY MORNING I'LL BE O.K. WELL THAT'S A VENTOUSE
WELL THE FIRST EVENT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP A CONCERT WAS HELD HERE IN THE HUGE FANS OWN IN CENTRAL PARIS LAST NIGHT IT'S SITUATED RIGHT UNDER THE GIANT CURVING METAL ARCHES OF THE EIFFEL TOWER I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO JEAN FRANCOIS TOWNS THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF PARIS FOR SPORT AND TOURISM ABOUT THE SECURITY PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE IN THIS CITY AND INDEED ACROSS THE NATION AND I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE COULD GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE FANS
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST NO COUNTRY AND NO CITIES IN WESTERN COUNTRIES RIGHT NOW CAN CLAIM THAT IT'S NOT UNDER THEM A TERRORIST RIGHT IT'S NOW GLOBAL SWEAT DOES YOU'RE A PERSONAL RISK NEVER EXISTED BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW HE'S THAT JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER THE TERRIBLE ATTACKS OF NOVEMBER WE ALMOST IN BARRY'S THE CUP TWENTY ONE WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CHIEF I'VE GOVERNMENTS FROM ALL THE WONDER WORLD AND WE PLANNED FOR YOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR FOUR YEARS NOW THANKS TO HER
WORK BETWEEN ALL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN EUROPE THEY WILL HELP US TO HAVE BETTER INTELLIGENCE BEFORE THE COMPETITION AND DURING THE GAMES AND YET THE SECURITY THREAT ITSELF HAS UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASED IN THOSE FOUR YEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR THIS HASN'T IT WE SAW LAST YEAR JUST THE TERRIBLE SERIES OF ATTACKS ARE NOT JUST ON PARIS PUT ON OTHER PLACES AROUND FRANCE YES OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE TERRORIST REDS AS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF OUR WERE
DELIVERING PLAN FOR DO YOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN BECAUSE THE CHERRY THREAT EXIST ON MAJOR SPORT EVEN FOR DECADES NOW REMEMBER MUNICH IF YOU REMEMBER THE MARATHON OF BOSTON

HAPPY EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE DO YOU THINK THE SECURITY MEASURES ARE STRONG ENOUGH AT THE FANS IN THAT YOU HAVE PLANNED TO BE AT THE EIFFEL TOWER A FORMER CHIEF OF POLICE OF FRANCE HAS SAID IT'S MADNESS TO PUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER THE EIFFEL TOWER EVERY NIGHT FOR A MONTH AND NOT EXPECT THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF RISK INVOLVED THEIR SECURITY OF THE FANS WILL BE THE SAME AS IN AN AIRPORT
YOU HAVE DOUBLE CONTROL YOU AFTAB YOU HAVE MAGNETIC CONTROLLED YOU'LL HAVE TO OPEN YOUR BAG BEFORE ENTERING SECONDLY WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY DANGEROUS IS NOT TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO OFFER THE FANS AND TO LET THEM ALL AROUND PARIS WITH NO SECURITY IF WE WOULD
NUTS ORGANISED STANDS ON WE WILL HAVE ADMITS THAT THE TERRORISTS HAVE WON WE HAVE TO ORGANISE THIS KIND OF FANS ON TO SHOW THAT THE BERRIES AND THE EUROPEANS PEOPLE ARE STILL ALIVE WANT TO LEAVE ONE TO CELEBRATE THE FOOTBALL LIKE EVER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR TALKING TO ME AND OF COURSE WE ALL WISH YOU ALL THE BEST WITH ALL THE PREPARATIONS YOU'VE MADE AND INDEED FOR THE TOURNAMENT ITSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OR MAYBE HOPE A FINAL BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FRANCE
OR WALES FRANCE PERHAPS QUARTER PAST SEVEN WHEN DAVID CAMERON CAME BACK FROM BRUSSELS ALL THOSE WEEKS AGO AFTER COMPLETING HIS NEGOTIATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS HE CLAIMED HE DID SHE WAS THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM EVER CLOSER UNION IT REPEATED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS YESTERDAY THAT HE'D SECURED TWO VITAL TREATY CHANGES BUT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IN THE PERSON OF THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. SIR BILL CASH WHO ALSO CHAIRS THE EUROPEAN SCRUTINY COMMITTEE SAYS THAT HE'S JUST NOT THE CASE AND HE IS WITH ME NOW
WHY ISN'T IT THE CASE HE IF HE SAYS HE DID THAT THAT'S WHAT HE DID ISN'T THAT THE CASE WELL A VERY SIMPLY BECAUSE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE ARE GUARANTEED TO THE VOTER ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THAT TO REMAIN IN MEANS THAT REFORMED UNION HE HAS TO ACTUALLY GET
EH TREATY CHANGE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AND HE CAN'T GET THAT BEFORE THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE QUITE OBVIOUSLY AND HE CANNOT THEREFORE SAY THE HAIR HE HAS SECURED VITAL TREATY CHANGES INCLUDING EVER CLOSER UNION AND HE HAS TO GET HER SHE SHOULD CHANGE HER EVER CLOSER UNION BECAUSE IT'S AN ARTICLE ONE OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF WHEN THOSE TREATIES ARE PRESENTED
WELL YES BUT THE FACT IS THAT ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THE VOTE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION HAS HE GOT A REFORMED UNION OR HASN'T IT AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO AND FURTHERMORE IT CAN'T BE ACHIEVED BY THEN SO THAT HE'S A LOT BETTER
SO SHE WAS EFFECTIVELY BEING CHEATED IN MY PEN BUT HE HAS AN UNDERTAKING HE TOLD US HE HAS ASSURED US HE HAS AN UNDERTAKING FROM OTHER LEADERS OF THE LEADERS WITH WHOM HE NEGOTIATED A FEW MONTHS AGO HE HAS AN UNDERTAKING THAT BRITAIN WILL NOT BE FORCED TO BECOME A PART OF THE EVER CLOSER UNION AS HE PUT IT WILL THE HOUSE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LIBRARY FOR EXAMPLE HAS PRODUCED A REPORT ON TWENTY SIXTH OF MAY
AND IT TALKS ABOUT THAT VERY DECISION AND IT SAYS IT CANNOT GUARANTEED THE OUTCOMES ENVISAGED IN IT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON FACTORS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE NATIONAL REFERENDUMS OR CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT SO ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS AND BY THE WEATHER YOUR PRINCE SCRUTINY CHRISTINA RICH I'M CHAIRMAN ALSO SAID WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT DECISION ITSELF DOES NOT AND CANNOT CHANGE THE TREATY AND THAT WAS AFTER TAKING ENORMOUS EVIDENCE FROM ALL THE EXPERTS
BUT THEN GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ALL WE DID MANAGE NOT TO BE A PART OF THE EURO WE DID MANAGE NOT TO BE A PART OF SHOWING THEM THAT IS CORRECT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT PASO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE ACTUALLY WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS PACKAGE WAS ABSOLUTELY VITAL BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO PRODUCE A REFORMED UNION WE WERE TOLD WE WERE GOING TO GET FULL ON TREATY CHANGE WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T GOT IT I'VE GOT IT YET NO BUT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF YET AS I'VE EXPLAINED
ALL THE EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU AND IT'S HERE IN BOTH THESE DOCUMENTS AS I'VE GOT HERE ABOUT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LIBRARY AND THE EUROPEAN SCRUTINY COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE DECISION THAT'S BEEN TAKEN BY THESE OTHER
COUNTRIES TOGETHER WITH US AND IT DOESN'T BIND IN EUROPEAN LAW THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL AND ONE LAST THING IF I MAY SAY ON THIS THE SPEAKER IS INDICATED IN REPLY TO MY POINT OF ORDER THAT ACTUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY ACCORDING TO A RESOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HAS GOT TO GIVE ME A REPLY WHICH I'VE SOUGHT BY TODAY BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL SAY THIS THAT IT'S QUITE CLEAR TO ME THAT HE CANNOT
RECTIFY THIS EXCEPT BY SIMPLY ACCEPTING THAT HE DID HE MADE A MISTAKE I WAS ACTUALLY HE WAS NOT CORRECT IN MAKING THE ASSERTION THAT HE'S GOT THESE VITAL TREES BEEN PRETTY TOUGH ON MISTER CAMERON WERE SEEING A LOT OF WHAT IS CALLED BLUE ON BLUE LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE WAS INTERESTING WASN'T IT BECAUSE THEY'D PILED INTO BORIS JOHNSON IT'S COMING APART AT THE SEAMS THE PARTY ISN'T IT AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEY'RE SAYING A SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK AT THE PARTY SAYING TO BORIS JOHNSON BACK OFF
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT THIS IS NOT A BLUE ON BLUE IF I MAY SAY SO NOT YOUR I'VE GOT ON THE PERSON AT THE BORIS JOHNSON THING IS WELL IT'S A BLUE ON BLUE WELL ACTUALLY IT IS IT IS THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE AS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO REMAIN THAT IS THE KEY ISSUE
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IF IT'S BLUE ON BLUE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SIMILAR SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND IN SEVERAL OTHER PARTIES THAT THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT BLUE ON BLUE IT'S IT'S THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND A BILL CASH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH

WELL I THINK THE RATE OF PUB CLOSURES THIS TOE DOWN QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE GOVERNMENT ABOLISHED THE DUTY ESCALATOR AND I THINK THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT IF YOU RUN PUBS VERY WELL IF YOU CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STAFF AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FOOD THEN THERE'S A GREAT ROLE FOR THE MODERN PUB IN TODAY'S SOCIETY OH COUPLE HAD WHEN'S LIVING WAGE AND BRICKS AT THE POPE POSSIBILITY FOR HAD A FRACTURE
I THINK THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE IS SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IN GENERAL IS GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT AND ACCOMMODATE WE TOOK THE DECISION TO PAY ALL OF OUR STAFF IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR AGE THEIR NATIONAL LIVING WAGE FROM OCTOBER IF THEY WERE TAKING PART IN ONE OF OUR FOURTEEN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES LIKE THAT'S BEEN REALLY WELL ACCEPTED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THE BUSINESS OF ACTS IT WOULD WORRY YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY DEPENDENT ON MIGRANT WORKERS
I THINK FIRSTLY THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN AROUND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE YEARS WE CONSCIOUSLY DESIGNED THE BUSINESS SO THAT IT CAN WEAR THE RECESSIONS CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT WORLD WARS BUT WE ARE RELIANT ON THE FACT THAT IN OUR PUBS WE HAVE A GREAT CHOICE OF STUFF TO CHOOSE FROM
IF YOU TAKE FOOD FOR EXAMPLE WERE ALL OF OUR FOOD IS FRESH WE DO IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE A TALENT POOL OF GREAT CHEFS AVAILABLE TO COOK FOOD NOW PUPS AND MUKKA WE WOULD FAVOUR REMAINING IN THE UNION WE TALKED ABOUT THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY THIS WEEKEND MATTHEW MENTIONED THIS WEEKEND TO BE EXTENDED OPENING HOURS HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR TAKINGS

TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW ROB'S HERE WITH THE SPORT THANKS MATTHEW AND AS YOU KNOW YOUR IMMEDIATE PROSPECTS FOR EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN HOURS FOLLOWS FRANCE AGAINST ROMANIA AS THE TOURNAMENT OPENS TODAY POLAND AGAINST NORTHERN IRELAND ON SUNDAY WAS TOMORROW ENGLAND AGAINST RUSSIA AND WALES AGAINST SLOVAKIA
WALES IN A MAJOR TOURNAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHRIS COLEMAN WILL TRAVEL BOTH AS A PLAYER AND AS A MANAGER BUT INTRODUCED TO THE JOB IN JANUARY TWENTY TWELVE IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVIOUS MANAGER GARY SPEED A PERSONAL FRIEND HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD AT HOME TWO MONTHS BEFORE FOLLOWING AN APPARENT SUICIDE AT THIS THE CONTEXT FOR COLEMAN'S NEW ROLE WHICH STARTED BADLY WITH FIVE CONSECUTIVE DEFEATS AS HE'S BEEN REMEMBERING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE PRETTY AROUND US WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE JOB IN THAT SITUATION WHERE I THINK ANYBODY
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN IN THAT WAS INCREDIBLE TOUGH TIME FOR EVERYONE AT THE TIME ANYWAY HE WAS ALL ABOUT RESULTS AND PERFORMANCES WHICH WON'T CREATE BUT I THINK MYSELF INCLUDED EIGHT ARE PROBABLY THEN UNDERSTAND ENOUGH THAT THE PLAYERS WERE STILL PROBABLY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION WE ALL FOUND OURSELVES IT PERMEATED THE WHOLE SQUAD I DON'T AND YOU GO FOR A LONG LONG TIME PERSONALLY
WE WERE ALL DEVASTATED WE ALL SORT OF EXPECTED TO DO A JOB
LOCK THAT MYSELF AND OUT YOU LOOK AT THE PLAYERS AND YOU ALMOST FORGET THE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE'VE GOT FEELINGS SO I DON'T THINK THEY WERE READY TO MOVE ON FROM THAT SITUATION AND LISTEN WITHOUT HIDING BEHIND ANYTHING COUPLED WITH THAT I WASN'T EXACTLY LEAD IN THE GROUP THE WAY SHOULD HAVE I WAS DOING THINGS THAT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT I WAS DOING THINGS THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS DONE BEFORE ME
IS THAT TACTICAL OR IS THAT IN MANAGEMENT WHAT IS THAT I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF EVERYTHING REALLY I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY ON THE PITCH I WAS TRYING TO KEEP THE SAME AS WHAT GARY HAD BEEN DOING BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE HAD A REAL GOOD TEN GAMES OR SAW ELEVEN GAMES IN CHARGE
THEY WON FIVE OF THOSE GAMES SO SO THEN EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP IT THE SAME WAY SO I FELT UNDER PRESSURE TO DO THAT WHEN I'M IN FRONT OF THE GROUP THE PLAYERS AND THEY DETECT THAT MAYBE I WAS AND BELIEVE IN WHAT I WAS SAYING TO THEM THEY'RE GOING TO PICK UP ON THAT AND I THINK THEY'RE DEAD HENCE WE HAD SOME POOR PERFORMANCES AND YET I DON'T HAVE YOU MARKED DOWN AS A MAN WHO'S ESPECIALLY CONFLICTED BY SELF DOUBT
MY FRIENDS BACK IN OR CHANGE ANYTHING AROUND BECAUSE HE WASN'T IT I OWE DETECTOR SPEEDS TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN PLACE BECAUSE WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS VERY GOOD YOU KNOW WHEN I ARRIVED IT WASN'T IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE WAS ANYTHING NEW THEY HAD SEEN YOU KNOW THE SPORT SCIENCE THAT HE INTRODUCED WELLES WAS SPORT SCIENCE ALL MY MANAGERIAL CAREER WALES HAD MAD SPORTS SCIENCE UNTIL GARY
CAME INTO US HE TOOK IT TO A NEW LEVEL IN THAT SENSE IN THAT SENSE BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED THE MANAGER BEFORE SPEEDS WAS JOHN TOSHACK AND JOHN HE'S FROM A DIFFERENT AREAS ON BELIEFS WHY WOULD JOHN WANNA CHANGE HIS BELIEFS HIS BEES IS AT THE VERY VERY TOP JOHN IDEAS HIS WE'RE DOING IT SPEEDS WE WAS DIFFERENT AND HE INTRODUCED TO SPORTS
BRING ON THE PITCH IN I FELT I OWED IT TO HIM WHEN WE HAD A LOT OF YOUNG PLAYERS WOULD BEEN USED TO PLAY IN A CERTAIN WAY IN SO THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT ENOUGH I COULDN'T SUSTAIN THAT BECAUSE IT IS NOT MY WAY OF TO DO THINGS I HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THINGS AND TOOK ME A WHOLE
TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO REALLY CHANGE AND START DOING THINGS I REALLY WANT TO DO IT SO MUCH OF THIS CAMPAIGN THEN GOES TO THE MEMORY OF GARY
WE ALL REMEMBER SPEEDS I THINK ABOUT HIM CONSTANTLY NOT JUST WHEN WE'RE ON CAMP SO I THINK THIS CONSTANT REMINDERS WE NEVER FORGET SPEEDS YOU'VE ALWAYS SPOKEN ABOUT HOW YOU ENJOY PLAYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY RATHER THAN FOR YOUR CLUB IS IT THE SAME FOR MARRIAGE
YEAH IT'S ALWAYS NOT THAT IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING THREE PLAYING FOR ANY OF THE CLUBS ARE PLAYFUL BUT WHEN YOU REPRESENT IN COUNTRY AREAS IT IS DIFFERENT SO A MANAGER YOU'RE A TRUE PATRIOT AREN'T YOU I AM I AM I AM PITY I THINK HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FIT THE ARCTIC IS NO GREATER HONOUR I'M NOT GOING TO GET A GREATER ONE ON ONE I'VE GOT NOW AND I'M PROUD OF THAT I WAS LUCKY TO PLAY FOR MY COUNTRY AND THEY WITNESSED STAND THEN THEY'RE SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AS A PLAYER IN ALL KNOWN DOON AS A MANAGER YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT IT ONCE YOU GET THAT FEELING THAT FEELING THAT YOU CAN'T TOP

WE DO RECOGNISE IT AND WE HAVE BEEN WARNING OFSTED HAS BEEN WARNING THE GOVERNMENT NOW FOR SOME TIME THAT THERE IS A GROWING PROBLEM OF TEACHER SHORTAGES AND TEACHER SUPPLY IT WAS A MAJOR FEATURE OF MAYA MY ANNUAL REPORT TO PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR WE DONE A SURVEY IN THREE BIG REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY
AND FOUND THE HEAD TEACHERS WERE STRUGGLING TO FILL POST WHY THEY WERE PARTICULARLY STRUGGLING TO FOOL POSED IN THE POOREST COMMUNITIES WELL I THINK THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM ABOUT THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED BY THE NASH BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
AND IT ARMED THAT DEALS WITH THIS THE NATIONAL COLLEGE FOR TEACHING AND LEADERSHIP AND WHAT I MEAN BY THE DATA IS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND THERE ARE NATIONAL STATISTICS AND THERE ARE REGIONAL STATISTICS THEY'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOWESTOFT IN LINCOLN AND LONDON WHAT SAID THEY'RE TRYING TO SORT OF MATCH ONE SIZE FITS ALL MAPPED WITHOUT DATA FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING A MATCH THAT DATA TO THE TRAINEES ARE TRAINED IN SCHOOL AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO WE WHEN WE DID THIS A SURVEY WE FIND THAT A LOT OF POSTS WOULD BEEN COVERED BY TEMPORARY STAFF AND THAT IS A STATISTIC THAT'S NOT COLLECTED WE FOUND THAT
LEVERS ARE LEAVING THEIR TRAINING INSTITUTIONS AND THAT STATISTIC IS NOT BEEN COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE YEAH AND THAT AND
IF YOU IF YOU DON'T COLLECT ACCURATE DATA ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING REGIONALLY AND SUB RUGELEY THEN YOU CAN'T PLAN FOR THE NUMBER OF TRAINEES IN TRAINING INSTITUTION ISN'T A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT BIT'S FEATURES IN THE IN THE P.A.C. REPORT WHICH IS OUT TODAY IS THAT IN IN LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST ARE OFF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT TRAINEES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND
PUPILS IN THE EAST OF ENGLAND THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY TRAINEES FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THIS IS THIS IS REALLY WORRYING BECAUSE THE EAST OF ENGLAND ISN'T UNDERACHIEVING PART OF THE COUNTRY LONDON THE SOUTH EAST ISN'T IT YOU NEED MORE TRAINEES WRITING TRADE SO THAT EACH TRAINEE HAS BEEN TRAINED THEN IN LONDON SO IT'S NOT THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT TO BE TEACHERS LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO BE TEACHERS BUT THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATOR OF SYSTEM HE'S BROKE HIS POOR IT'S
POORLY MANAGED AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF A TREE TRAINEES IS HIS POOR RUN NATIONAL COLLEGE FOR TEACHING LEADERSHIP IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB TO SERVE A TEACHING PROFESSIONS RIGHT AND YOU USED A VERY STRONG WORD TO DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS THEY LEAVE PRIMARY SCHOOL TO GO TO SECONDARY SCHOOL THEY DON'T GET THE TREAT THE TEACHING THEY NEED YOU CALLED IT A SCANDAL
IT IS A SCANDAL AND THE TWO ISSUES THE ISSUE OF TRAINING TEACHERS AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS AND GOOD TEACHERS NOT SCHOOLS IS RELATED TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF OF GETTING THE BEST OUT OF OUR BRIGHTEST CHILDREN BECAUSE UNLESS YOU'VE GOT WELL QUALIFIED PEOPLE
PEOPLE WITH GOOD SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE BEST OUT OF ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN IN POORER AREAS ESPECIALLY THE STATISTICS OR START TWO THIRDS OF YOUNGSTERS WHO'VE GOT THE BEST GRADES AT THE END OF KEY STAGE TWO THE END OF PRIMARY SCHOOL TWO THIRDS AND DIDN'T GET MY OWN A. STAR FIVE YEARS LATER A QUART OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN GET THE EXPECTED LEVEL OF A B. GRADE THAT IS SHOCKING AS THAT IS SHOCKING WE'VE SAID THIS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED AGAIN UNLESS WE GET
GOOD PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM WELL QUALIFIED PEOPLE WITH GOOD SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE THAT SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO IMPROVE SO LOOK AT A LOT SHALL WE SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS NOT DOING ITS JOB WELL THE NATIONAL POLITICIAN RELIGION WHICH IS THE ART DEPARTMENT HAS GOT TO GET IT TACKED TOGETHER HEAD TEACHERS THAT I SPEAK TO A FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WHAT THEY CAN'T DO AND I SPEAK AS AN EX HEAD ON THIS ONE THEY CAN'T DO IS WORRY ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHERE THEIR NEXT MATHS
POST IS GOING TO COME FROM WHERE THE NEXT SIZE POSER GOING TO COME THEY'VE GOT TO MANAGE THEIR SCHOOL MONITOR CLASSROOM ACTIVITY DEAL WITH DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS AND SO ON IF THEY CONSTANTLY WORRYING ABOUT WHERE THE NEXT TEACHER'S GOING TO COME FROM THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB PROPERLY SO MICHAEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS ALMOST TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SORRY EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND WILL TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS MIGRANTS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TRYING TO SNEAK INTO BRITAIN AT A RATE OF ONE EVERY SIX MINUTES THE PAPER SAYS OFFICIAL FIGURES RELEASED AFTER WEEKS OF URGING UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT SHOW THAT THERE WERE EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DETENTIONS THAT U.K. BORDER PORTS IT POINTS IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM LAST YEAR THE DAILY MAIL HAS ANOTHER FIGURE
IT SAYS IT EMERGE YESTERDAY THAT NEARLY TWO MILLION MIGRANTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE SETTLED IN BRITAIN IN JUST TEN YEARS BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS SAID THE HUGE NUMBERS PLACE MASSIVE PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES THE PAPER REPORTS THE GUARDIAN QUOTES NICOLA STURGEON FROM LAST NIGHT'S REFERENDUM DEBATE ON I. T. V. SHE SAID IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO ACCESS PUBLIC SERVICES
BLAME THE POLITICIANS NOT THE IMMIGRANTS THE GUARDIAN THINKS SHE LED A CONCERTED ONSLAUGHT BY SENIOR REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS TO DISCREDIT BORIS JOHNSON DURING THE DEBATE
THE MALE AGREES WITH THAT THE THREE REMAINING THE WOMEN AS THEY PUT IT GANGED UP ON MY JOHNSON SAYS THE TORY M.P. JOHNSON SUFFERED RELENTLESS BARBS ABOUT HIS NUMBER TEN AMBITIONS
THE SECURITY MINISTER JOHN HAYES HAS TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TOO RIGID TO DEAL WITH A PAN NATIONAL TERRORIST THREAT IT PROMPTS THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE BRITAIN CAN FIGHT TERROR THREAT BETTER OUTSIDE THE PAPER SAYS THE INTERVENTION BY MISTER HAYES RISKS UNDERMINING ONE OF THE CENTRAL ARGUMENTS OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN
BUT THE TIMES COLUMNIST PHILIP COLLINS SAYS VOTE LEAVE HAS BEEN IN HIS WORDS THE MOST UNSERIOUS POLITICAL CAMPAIGN I CAN REMEMBER THEY ARE THE MOTLEY CREWS MOTLEY CREW HE SAYS THEY ALL WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE MIRROR SAYS IT HAS EXPOSED A MASSIVE SECURITY FAILURE BY FINDING ENGLAND'S EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TEAM BUS UNGUARDED IN CHANTILLY IN FRANCE WITH CHIEF REPORTER AND THE LINES IS PICTURED IN SHORTS AND T. SHIRT
SITTING IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT HE ALSO MANAGED TO CLAMBER INTO THE BAGGAGE HOLD PAPER SAYS THAT WITH FEARS AND ISLAMIC STATE TERROR STRIKE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH IN FRANCE THE BUS IN MEANT TO BE GUARDED BY ARMED SECURITY PERSONNEL AROUND THE CLOCK
IT IS COMING UP TO SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE FUNERAL OF THE THREE TIMES HEAVYWEIGHT WORLD BOXING CHAMPION MUHAMMAD ALI WILL TAKE PLACE LATER TODAY IN THE TOWN WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP LOU EVIL CAN TURKEY HE SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE BATTLING NOT JUST IN THE RING BUT ALSO OUTSIDE IT FOR THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES AND THE POOR TODAY THE FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WILL GIVE A EULOGY
AND AMONG THOSE CARRYING ALI'S COFFIN WILL BE THE BRITISH FORMER WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION LENNOX LEWIS I ASKED HIM EARLIER WHAT HE'D BE THINKING OFFICE HE HELPS TO CARRY THE BOXER WHO INSPIRED HIM
I'M SURE A LOT OF MEMORIES GOOD THOUGHTS WILL GO THROUGH MY MIND BY THE TIME IT'S A VERY HUMBLING FEELING A WARM FEELING THAT WILL GO THROUGH MY MIND AND POSITIVE
YOU DESCRIBE MUHAMMAD ALI AS BEING LIKE A FATHER TO YOU WHY DID YOU FEEL SUCH A PERSONAL BOND BECAUSE OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN WE USED TO GO TO SCHOOL AND PEOPLE SAID ONE WHO WERE YOUR HEROES AND WHY
YOU COULD SAY HE'S A FATHER BECAUSE WE WERE COMING FROM THE SAME KIND OF SITUATION ONE PARENT AND I EVEN WOULD WANT PARENT HE'S SHOWN THAT OTHER KIDS OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN STILL BE THE GREATEST
YOU SAY YOU HAVE TWO HEROES REALLY MUHAMMAD ALI AS ONE AND NELSON MANDELA BEING THE ARTHUR I WONDER IF SOME PEOPLE WILL FIND IT STRANGE THAT YOU PUT THOSE TWO MEN HAVE SUCH DIFFERENT TALENTS AND SUCH DIFFERENT IT IMPACT ON THE WORLD INTO THE SAME CATEGORY CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT FOR YOU LINKS THE TWO JUST WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW YOU COULD LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF AMERICA
WHEN MUM DOLLY CAME UP YOU KNOW HE WAS VERY BOISTEROUS AND VERY FOCUSED AND HE WASN'T AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT
YOU COULD LOOK AT MANDELA'S BE IN THE SAME WAY HE HE WENT TO JOE OFFERS BELIEVES AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WASN'T UPSET
THAT WAS REALLY POSITIVE MA'AM DOLLY FART FOR EQUAL RIGHTS HE FAR FOR OTHER PEOPLE HE WHAT HE REALLY WANTED TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND HE WAS VERY VOCAL ABOUT HIS RELIGION AND NEVER PEOPLE STOP HIS BELIEFS
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS RACIALLY ABUSED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE YOU'VE MADE SOME COMPARISONS WITH WHERE HE WAS COMING FROM AND WHERE YOU WERE COMING FROM ARE YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE BUT DO YOU THINK HE HAD AN IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES
YEAH I THINK HE HAD AN IMPACT ON EVERY YOUNG KID AROUND THE WORLD THAT WATCHED HIM HE SAID HE WAS THE GREATEST SAID HE WAS BEAUTIFUL HE SAID HE WAS THE PRETTIEST BOXER OUTBURST SO PEOPLE AROUND THERE WAS THERE WAS THIS GUY SAYING HE'S PRETTY THERE'S A SCOUT TALK INSOMUCH AS MY ON THE DOLLY
WHEN A PERSON TALKS LIKE THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO USED WHO'S THAT TALKING IT'S MUHAMMAD ALI SO HE WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR
WHY DO YOU THINK MUHAMMAD ALI CAPTURED THE PUBLIC IMAGINATION LIKE NO OTHER BOXER
PART OF THE REASON WAS BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WASN'T AFRAID TO SPEAK AND REALLY IN ONE SENSE YOU COULD SAY WHEN AGAINST AMERICA WHEN AMERICA WANTED HIM TO GO TO THE WAR HE BASICALLY SAID NO AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO RESPECT A MAN LIKE THAT
I THINK YOU'VE SAID THAT THE FIRST TIME YOU MET HIM WAS WHEN YOU WERE FIGHTING AND HE WAS WATCHING YOUR FIGHT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY DAUNTING FOR A YOUNG BOXER IT WAS BUT WE REALISE THAT YOU KNOW THE GREATEST RINGSIDE WATCHING YOU
FOR ME I JUST WANTED TO SHAKE HIS HAND THEN LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ON MY PARTY SO YOU LOST THAT FIGHT DIDN'T YOU I LOST THAT FIGHT HE SAID I WANT TO AND HE SAID I WAS GOING TO BE GOOD SOME DAY AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME I STEPPED IN THE GYM WENT TO PRACTICE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SO THEY'RE REALLY HELP ME ACHIEVE MY GOAL
AND OVER THE YEARS THAT FRIENDSHIP THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU OBVIOUSLY GREW WHY WAS THAT IT CLEARLY WASN'T JUST BECAUSE OF HIS BOXING ABILITY
I THINK MOST OF ALL IS BECAUSE HE APPROVED OF ME AND HE WAS SHOWING HIS A PROVEN AND WHY DID THAT MEAN SO MUCH TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I CAN SAY THAT
GOOD IS SOMEBODY THAT'S GOOD AND HE IS THE GREATEST SO IF HE SAYS I'M GREAT I HAVE TO BELIEVE THEM AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT LENNOX LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A NORWICH STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE RIGHT REVEREND GRAHAM JAMES GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IN ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN STORIES ABOUT THE QUEEN SHE SPEAKING TO A PERSON WHOSE MOBILE PHONE THEN STARTS RINGING PAUSING BRIEFLY THE QUEEN APPARENTLY SAYS YOU BETTER ANSWER THAT IT MAY BE SOMEONE IMPORTANT
TODAY A SULPHUR FACING MONARCH WILL BE AT SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL FOR A SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING FOR HER NINETIETH BIRTHDAY LONG LIFE DOES NOT IN ITSELF GENERATE AFFECTION BUT THE WARMTH OF THE ADMIRATION FOR THE QUEEN IS SUCH THAT EVEN PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER MET HER SPEAK OF LOVING
IT'S SURPRISING THAT THE MONARCHY IS SO POPULAR WHEN THE HEREDITARY PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN LARGELY EXCISED FROM THE BODY POLITIC DURING THE QUEEN'S REIGN BUT THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE IT'S STILL ALIVE AND WELL IN OUR FAMILIES THE NEXT GENERATION DOES NOT SIMPLY INHERIT WHATEVER WEALTH WE'VE GOT THAT FAMILY STORIES AND TRADITIONS TO SEW A ROYAL FAMILY CAN BE WON WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE OF A NATION IDENTIFY BOTH IN JOYFUL TIMES AND SAD ALIKE
THE QUEEN'S REFERENCE TO HER ANNUS HORRIBILIS IS VIVIDLY REMEMBERED BY CONTRAST THE RECENT HAPPY PHOTOGRAPHS OF FOUR GENERATIONS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TOGETHER SUGGESTS THE SORT OF CONTINUITY IS THE FRENZY OF MODERN POLITICS COULD NEVER SUPPLY
NOT LONG AGO A COIN COLLECTOR POINTED OUT TO ME HOW IN OUR POCKETS WE CARRY A HISTORY OF THE QUEEN'S LIFE HER GRACEFUL AGEING ON A COINAGE HAS BEEN DELICATELY DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF HER REIGN SHE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN SURROUNDED BY ELDERLY MEN IN POLITICS THE CHURCH THE LAW AND BUSINESS SHE WAS THEN A REFRESHING COUNTER TO THE MAINSTREAM
IN HER LATER YEARS SHE IS SURROUNDED BY MEN AND WOMEN STILL MOSTLY MEN OR VERY JUNIOR TO HER A GENTLE CHALLENGE TO A SOCIETY WHICH CAN SOMETIMES BE AGEIST
THE QUEEN HAS ALSO TRAVELLED AGAINST THE FLOW BY REMAINING SO EMPHATICALLY LOYAL TO HER CHRISTIAN FAITH IN AN INCREASINGLY SECULAR AGE WHEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY SUCH AS IN HER CHRISTMAS BROADCASTS SHE HAS SPOKEN OF JESUS CHRIST BEING AN INSPIRATION AND AN ANCHOR IN MY LIFE A ROLE MODEL OF RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS
THE QUEEN IS NOT ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE TRENDS OF HER TIME BUT REMAIN DETERMINEDLY CONSISTENT PERHAPS OUR ADMIRATION IS KEENER BECAUSE WE REALISE THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S CALLING WAS UN CHOSEN IT IS DEDICATION TO IT HIS UNWAVERING AND WHO STEADFASTNESS AND FAITH AS A REMINDER THAT SHE'S HER OWN PERSON
SOME WORDS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH THE FIRST FOUR CENTURIES AGO A APPROACH APPLY EQUALLY NOW TO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND THOUGH SHE'D PROBABLY BE TOO MODEST TO SAY THEM THOUGH GOD HAS RAISED ME HIGH YET THIS COUNT THE GLORY OF MY CROWN THAT I HAVE REIGNED WITH YOUR LOVES
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE RIGHT REVEREND GRAHAM JAMES THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE LAST TIME THAT FRANCE HOSTED A MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP LIKE THIS WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE WORLD CUP THEY WON IT WITH A TEAM WHICH GAINED A NICKNAME BLACK BLONK
IT WAS A NAME THAT REFLECTED THE MULTI CULTURAL MAKE UP OF THE WINNING SQUAD BLACK WHITE ARAB AND AT THE TIME THAT TEAM WAS HELD UP AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW FRANCE HAD EMBRACED ITS MULTI CULTURAL MAKE UP
ALMOST TWO DECADES ON WE WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THAT IS STILL THE CASE MANY SAY IT IS NOT SO I TOOK A TOUR OF PARIS WITH FORMER FRENCH INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALLER LUIS A ONCE OFF MANCHESTER UNITED EVERTON AND FULHAM FAME AMONG OTHERS WHO WAS BORN IN THIS CITY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT A YEAR AFTER HIS PARENTS WHO WERE MUSLIMS ARRIVED HERE FROM GUADELOUPE
YOU MEAN A LOT TO ME I'M BORN HERE I GREW UP HERE
THEY START IN THE WORLD WHEN I LOOK AT THE MAP I THINK PARIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TIME YOU CAN TRY
WHAT DID IT MEAN FOR THE CITY AND FOR YOU WHEN THE ATTACKS HAPPENED SEVERAL ATTACKS LAST YEAR WAS A DISASTER I WAS QUITE AWARE IN SO I WAS
FRAID FROM MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY SOME PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I'VE BEEN HIT
THIS IS VERY UNPLEASANT VERY SAD TO SEE PEOPLE CAN GO TO THE EXTREME
SO THE FIRST PLACE LOUISE BROUGHT ME TO IS THE FOOTBALL CLUB WHERE HE I GUESS YOU COULD SAY STARTED HIS CAREER WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
I WAS REALLY ON REMEMBER SITTING ON THAT ON THIS VENTURE ACTUALLY WAITING FOR HOURS TO ACTUALLY DECIDE TO GO FOR SHE'S A CHARMER WE'RE GONNA MEET A COUPLE OF HIS FRIENDS FROM THAT TIME BACK
SO THIS IS ONE OF THEM PAUL EVE WHOSE PARENTS CAME FROM THE CONGO ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT LUISA HAAS PARENTS CAME FROM GUADELOUPE
BOTH BOYS WERE BORN HERE IN PARIS
AND AT FIRST THEY SAY THEY DON'T REALLY NOTICE RACISM IN THEIR DAILY LIVES
WHAT ONLY DRINKS OR POSSES COMES OR WHEN YOU'RE A KID YOU DO NOT FEEL ANY RACISM BUT WHEN YOU GROW UP YOU DIE SEE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE YOU JUST ENJOY YOURSELF THAT'S IT
SO THE FIRST MOMENT WHERE I REALISED
EXISTED THERE WHEN HOUR IS ONLY GUNS FROM THIS SPECIAL MOMENT
MY BEST FRIEND AND MY DAD WE WENT WITH
ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN KIND OF ATTACK FROM MY FANS
WE'VE ALL GOT OLDER OR YOUNGER BROTHERS WHO ARE REALLY WELL QUALIFIED BUT ARE STILL WORKING AT MCDONALD'S JUST COS THEIR NAME DOESN'T FIT ELSEWHERE
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE'RE BORN WE HAVE TO WORK TWO OR THREE TIMES HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE JUST TO MAKE IT AND WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD THAT AS WELL WE JUST NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY SORRY BUBBLE
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS GOING TREASONS DOING MORE LIKE HIM GOING I THINK I FELT HE WAS SAFE IN THE INTEGRATED MAYBE
LIVING IN THE WAR BECAUSE I AM TALKING ABOUT FOOD AND I'VE GONE WITH A WITH A NAME AND A CONSUMER FOOTAGE IMPORTED FROM A NEW TYPE OF
AND EVEN NOW WITH WITH YOUR STATUS WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE KNOW YOU
YOU FEEL THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE VIEW THE COLOUR OF YOUR SKIN IN ENGLAND
AS OPPOSED TO FRANCE YES IF I WOULD SAY THAT IS A STAGGERING DIFFERENCE
ALL OF THEM AND THE DRUMMER WITH THE OP ON TOM'S SUMMONING ENGLAND JUST LOOK AT LONDON'S NEW MAYOR HE'S A MUSLIM HE'S A SON OF AN IMMIGRANT HE'S GOT A POSITION ON MERITS
HERE IN FRANCE IS NOTHING TO DO WITH MERIT THERE RELIGIOUS BARRIERS IS BARRIERS BECAUSE YOUR COLOUR
YOUR GENDER OF COURSE AS WELL BASICALLY THERE ARE LOADS OF BARRIERS THANK YOU OF THE PROBLEMS FOR YOU SO DO YOU BOOK THE BOOK
HEY I WAS HERE IN PARIS AFTER THE BUTTER CLAW UNDERSTAND THE FRANCE ATTACKED IN NOVEMBER AND ON BOTH THOSE OCCASIONS PEOPLE WE MUST BE STRONGER WE MISS LIVED TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE SUSPICIOUS OF THE OTHER
I THINK IF YOU ASK ME THAT QUESTION ANSWER THING PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
THE MOMENT OF THE FRED WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE
WHICH DRESS SO JOHN WHERE'S IS LIKE SOMEONE IF YOU CAN DRESS WE TRACKSUIT WITH A HOOD MISSING THAT DOG PROPERLY HE WHICH IS EXTREME WITH SOME PEOPLE
DOING OR ABLE THINGS PRESENT TO BE PUT IN THE BASKET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING AND TRY TO BE
I SUPPOSE THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE TO END THIS BRIEF TOUR OF PARIS UP ON THE STEPS OF SECULAR CURE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING THERE LISTENING TO THE MUSICIAN
I'M NOW TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING OUT OVER THIS HUGE BEAUTIFUL CITY
WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW OFF TO THE WORLD
WE'RE HERE TO ENJOY IT AND WE WOULD CLUB DREAMS TOGETHER TO A MOTION TOGETHER THERE IS A LOT OF MY MOMENT LIKE THIS WE CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT WHAT A LADY'S VALUE NOW OLD WOW WE'RE STILL HERE

REFERENDUM UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE ACROSS FRANCE FOR THE START OF THE EURO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT AND A NATIONAL SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING IS BEING HELD IN LONDON TO MARK THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH BIRTHDAY TODAY'S NEWSREADER DIANA SPEAK
SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES ARE TOEING THE PARTY SUPPORTERS THEY AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WILL BE HIT BY TAX RISES SPENDING CUTS AND A WATERING DOWN OF WORKERS' RIGHTS OF BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. THEY'RE MAKING THE WARNING AS THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM CRITICISED LABOUR'S CAMPAIGNING IN THE REFERENDUM HE SAID IT WAS FAILING TO GET THROUGH TO THE PARTY'S TRADITIONAL VOTERS AND THERE REMAIN SIDE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING DEFEATED HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATTS
LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON AND SHADOW CABINET COLLEAGUES WOULD SUGGEST THIS MORNING THAT'S AN EMERGENCY BUDGET WOULD BE NECESSARY IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WILL PRESENT THEIR OWN ANALYSIS OF FIGURES FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SUGGESTING THAT EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF SPENDING CUTS AND TAX RISES WOULD BE IN THE PIPELINE AND LABOUR VOTERS FACE FURTHER SHOCK THERAPY FROM THE PARTY'S FORMER LEADER ED MILIBAND WHO WANTS SEPARATELY THAT THE CONSERVATIVES WOULD MOVE TO THE RATE AFTER BREAK
AND REDUCE WORKERS' RIGHTS COURT LEAVE SAY THE CLAIMS ARE FANCIFUL AND DESCRIBE SUCH TACTICS AS PROJECT FEAR BUT IN TRUTH IT SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES WHO ARE CURRENTLY VERY WORRIED
BY TALKING WITH ELECTION AGENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY'VE BEEN DISCOVERING IT FAR MORE OF THEIR SUPPORTERS ARE PREPARED TO BACK BRAKES IT'S THAN YOU DENTISTS ARE PITTED AND A NEWSNIGHT THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM EVEN RAISED THE PROSPECT OF DEFEAT FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN FAR TOO MUCH
AND NOT ENOUGH HOLE IN RECENT TIMES WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT HERE WE ARE TWO WEEKS AWAY
FROM THE VERY REAL PROSPECT THAT BRITAIN WILL VOTE
ISOLATION THAT'S HOW I SEE THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE LABOUR M.P. JOHN MANN AND THE LEFT WINGER DENNIS SKINNER HAVE DECLARED THEIR BACKING FOR BREAKS AT THIS MORNING SATING CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION MY MIND HAD SUGGESTED WESTMINSTER WOULD BE SHOCKED TO LEARN JUST HOW MANY MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY WILL ALSO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GETS UNDERWAY IN FRANCE THIS EVENING WITH THE COUNTRY STILL ON THE HIGHEST STATE OF ALERT AFTER LAST NOVEMBER'S TERROR ATTACKS IN PARIS SEVEN MILLION FERNS ARE EXPECTED TO VISIT THE TEN WHO CITIES OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AGAINST A BACKDROP OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY RAIL WORKERS AND AIRLINE PILOTS OUR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT KATIE GORNALL WHO'S A NEON LOOKS AHEAD TO THE TOURNAMENT
AS EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN PREPARES TO KICK OFF FRANZ REMAINS A COUNTRY ON EDGE LABOUR DISPUTES HAVE LEFT THE NATION FACING BRUISING STRIKES WHILE FANS ARRIVING AT THEIR STAB TO FRANCE FOR TONIGHT'S OPENING GAME BETWEEN THE HOSTS ARE ROMANIA WILL EXPERIENCE THE MOST INTENSE SECURITY OPERATION EVER SEEN AT A MAJOR TOURNAMENT
SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS FEARS OVER TERRORISM REMAIN ACUTE UP TO NINETY THOUSAND POLICE OFFICERS AND PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS HAVE BEEN DRAFTED IN FOR THE MONTH LONG EVENT THE FRENCH HOPE THEY'RE TALENTED SIDE COULD LIFT THE COUNTRY'S SPIRITS AND THERE IS AN AIR OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION EIGHTEEN YEARS AFTER FRANCE WON THE WORLD CUP ON HOME SOIL
FRENCH POLICE USED TEAR GAS TO TACKLE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN ENGLAND FOOTBALL FANS AND LOCAL YOUTHS AND MUST SAY ONE SUPPORTER SUFFERED A HEAD INJURY AFTER BEING STRUCK BY A CHAIR DURING A BRAWL OUTSIDE A BURGER BAR CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT STEVE NEIL WHO'S IN CHARGE OF ENGLAND FAN SECURITY IN THE CITY PRAISED THE RESPONSE OF HIS FRENCH COLLEAGUES
POLICE HAVE MOVED IN VERY QUICKLY DISPERSE AND WE'VE SEEN SCENES WHERE THERE WAS TEAR GAS USE WHICH FOR US AS ENGLISH AND U.K. RESIDENTS WERE NOT USED TO SEE THAT LOOKS FAIRLY DRAMATIC BUT THEY ARE ON EUROPE IT'S A NORMAL TACTIC OATH ENABLES THEM TO DISPERSE OR TO SUCH AN ORDER WAS RESTORED VERY QUICKLY
HUMANITARIAN WORKERS IN SYRIA'S SAY THE BESIEGED REBEL HELD TOWN OF DE RARE HAS RECEIVED HIS FIRST DELIVERY OF FOOD AID SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE CONVOY OF MIND LORRIES WAS CARRYING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE POPULATION FOR ONE MONTH AS WELL AS MEDICAL AID
M.P.S HAVE CALLED FOR AN URGENT REVIEW OF TEACHER TRAINING IN ENGLAND CLAIMING THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO PLAN TO SOLVE A GROWING SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE SAYS TARGETS TO FILL TEACHER TRAINING PLACES HAVE MISTER HAVE BEEN MISSED FOUR YEARS IN A ROW OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT JULIAN HARGREAVES HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT
WHAT DOES A GOOD TEACHER MAKE THESE STAGES THEY MAKE THE COMPLEX UNDERSTANDABLE AND THE MIND BOGGLING MAGIC THE CURRENT ADVERTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION AIMS TO ENTICE GRADUATES INTO THE CLASSROOM THERE ARE WIDE VARIATIONS IN TEACHER TRAINING PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE TRAINEES FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUPILS IN THE EAST OF ENGLAND COMPARED TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE NORTH WEST
AS A RESULT SCHOOLS IN POORER AREAS ISOLATED PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THOSE WITH LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT GOOD TEACHERS WITH RELEVANT SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SAYS THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED APPROACH TO TEACHER RECRUITMENT INCLUDING HIGH PROFILE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS NEW ROUTES INTO TEACHING AND GENEROUS BURSARIES
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT TEACHER TRAINING WAS BEING POORLY MANAGED AND WAS CONTRIBUTING TO WHAT HE CALLED A SCANDAL THE UNDER PERFORMANCE HAVE BRIGHT PUPILS AND ENGLAND SIR MICHAEL IS DUE TO STAND DOWN AS HEAD OF OFSTED IN DECEMBER IN A REPORT TODAY HE SAYS HE HAS CONSISTENTLY LAMENTED THE FAILURE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO STRETCH THE MOST ABLE CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS
THE STATISTICS ARE START TWO THIRDS OF YOUNGSTERS WHO'VE GOT THE BEST GRADES AT THE END OF KEY STAGE TWO THE END OF PRIMARY SCHOOL TWO THIRDS AND DIDN'T GET MY OWN A. STAR FIVE YEARS LATER THAT IS SHOCKING WE'VE SAID THIS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND NOT MUCH IS CHANGED AGAIN UNLESS WE GET GOOD PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM WELL QUALIFIED PEOPLE WITH GOOD SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE THAT SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO IMPROVE
FURTHER EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS THE PROCEDURE INVOLVES POWERFUL CHEMOTHERAPY TO COMPLETELY DESTROY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS THEN REBUILT USING STEM CELLS THE STUDY BY CANADIAN RESEARCHERS HAS SHOWN ENCOURAGING RESULTS WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE HALTED AND IN SOME CASES EVEN REVERSED BUT IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED SIGNIFICANT RISKS AS A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC HUGHES REPORTS
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS OR M.S. IS CAUSED WHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE BODY DAMAGING NERVE CELLS IN THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD AROUND TWO MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE AFFECTED ONE EXISTING TREATMENT IS FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO BE SUPPRESSED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY BEFORE STEM CELLS ARE INTRODUCED TO THE PATIENT'S BLOODSTREAM BUT WRITING IN MY JOURNAL THE LANCET RESEARCHERS FROM CANADA REPORT HOW THEY WENT FURTHER BY DESTROYING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER BEFORE REBUILDING IT WITH STEM CELLS
THIS AGGRESSIVE APPROACH HAS RISKS IN THIS SMALL STUDY OF JUST TWENTY FOUR PATIENTS ONE DIED BUT AMONG THE SURVIVORS OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO THIRTEEN YEARS THERE WERE NO RELAPSES AND NO NEW DETECTABLE SIGNS OF THE DISEASE THE AUTHORS AND OTHER EXPERTS WARN THAT THE RESULTS SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH CAUTION AND HIGHLIGHT THIS SUBSTANTIAL RISKS BUT SAY TREATMENTS LIKE THIS DO OFFER HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
HILLARY CLINTON HAS ONE MORE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN THE UNITED STATES SHE'S BEEN ENDORSED BY THE PROMINENT LIBERAL SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN AND THE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN THEY'RE BACKING FOLLOWED THAT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO RELEASED A VIDEO LAST NIGHT SAYING SHE HAD THE COURAGE AND COMPASSION TO SUCCEED HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
BOTH IN TONE AND TIMING BARACK OBAMA COULDN'T HAVE DONE MORE HE WAS FULL OF PRAISE FOR HIS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WAR CAMPAIGN WITH HER IN WISCONSIN NEXT WEEK AND THE TIMING IS PERFECT AS IT KEEPS THE MOMENTUM GOING AFTER HER VICTORY EARLIER IN THE WEEK BUT NO ENDORSEMENT YET FROM HER RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS HE'S WON THE SUPPORT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PRIMARY RACE AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IT DOING THAT ALL TO WIN HIM AND HIS SUPPORT BASE OVER HE SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO MEETING HER IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO SEE HOW THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER
THAT'S BEING SEEN AS A POSITIVE SIGN TO OTHER ENDORSEMENTS THAT HILLARY CLINTON PICKED UP LAST NIGHT WITH HIM OR VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN SHE SEEMED TO BE CLOSER TO BERNIE SANDRA'S POLITICALLY BUT WHAT'S MARKED HER OUT IT'S HER ABILITY SEEMINGLY TO RILE DONALD TRUMP IN HER MOST RECENT THOUGH SHE DESCRIBED HIM AS A NASTY THIN SKINNED FRAUD
THE FUNERAL OF MUHAMMAD ALI TAKES PLACE IN HIS HOME TOWN OF LOUIS VILLE IN KENTUCKY TODAY THERE WILL BE A PROCESSION THROUGH THE CITY BEFORE AN INTERFAITH MEMORIAL SERVICE AS A SPORTS STADIUM THE FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WILL DELIVER THE EULOGY WHILE TWO OF THE BOX CHILDREN AND HIS WIDOW WILL ALSO SPEAK

THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM AND SAID THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS FACING A VERY REAL PROSPECT OF DEFEAT WILL MISTER MILIBAND IS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO BUT FIRST
LAURA COULDN'T BOOK A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LABOUR LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE IT RATHER LOOKED AS THOUGH QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WERE GANGING UP ON BORIS JOHNSON
IT CERTAINLY DID JOHN I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST NOTABLE THING I WAS A VERY GRUMPY BAD TEMPERED TUE OURS YOU KNOW TIME AND AGAIN THE REMAIN CAMP TRIED TO GO ASKED HIM BORIS JOHNSON HE BY CONTRAST WAS RATHER UNUSUALLY A BIT LIKE A SORT OF CAGED BEAST LAST NIGHT SORT OF CLEARLY TRYING VERY MUCH NOT TO RETALIATE BUT IT WAS A CLEAR ATTEMPT TO DIMINISH HIM HE TELLS YOU THE REMAIN CAMP DO YOU FEAR HOW VALUABLE HE IS TO THEIR RIVALS THAT THEY WERE DELIBERATELY I THINK TRYING TO HUMBLE HIM IN FRONT OF A BIG AUDIENCE WAS ALSO
REALLY INTERESTING WAS THAT AN EXTRA LAYER OF HIS CABINET COLLEAGUE AMBER RUDD WENT AFTER HIM RIGHT FROM THE GECKO ONE MINISTER THAT TO ME IS BENEATH HER AND FOOLISH
BUT THERE WERE SOME PRETTY VICIOUS CLASHES BETWEEN HER AND ANDREA LEAD SOME HARD TORY COLLEAGUE THEY EVEN WORK IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT THE PRIME MINISTER IS THEN TWEETING MESSAGES PRAISING AMBER ARRIVED AFTER THE DEBATE WHAT DOES THAT TELL US IT TELLS US THAT THE REMAIN CAMP ARE NERVOUS ENOUGH ABOUT LOSING THIS REFERENDUM THAT THOSE EARLY INTENTIONS OF AVOIDING SO CALLED BLUE ON BLUE CLASHES BETWEEN TORIES THEY ARE TOTALLY AND UTTERLY SMASHED TO BITS DOES IT ALSO TELL US JUST QUICKLY IF YOU WOULD ON THIS ONE THAT SCARED BORIS JOHNSON MIGHT BECOME PRIME MINISTER ONE DAY
WELL I THINK LOOK THIS TORY LEADERSHIP LEADERSHIP AMBITIONS ARE SORT OF LACED THROUGH ALL OF THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY AMBER RUDD WASN'T JUST GOING AFTER BORIS JOHNSON SHE WAS PLAINLY SAYING DON'T TRUST THIS GUY COS HE'S ONLY IN THIS BECAUSE YOU WANT DAVID CAMERON JOB THAT SOLO IN PUBLIC NO NOT EVEN PRIVATE PRIVATE VICIOUS GOSSIP EVERYONE RIGHT WHAT ABOUT LABOUR WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO ACHIEVE
THEY'RE PILING IN TODAY WITH A BOLD CLAIM THAT IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THERE MIGHT BE EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS OF CUTS OR TAX RISES BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE ECONOMY IF WE GO ED MILLIBAND WILL BE MAKING WARNINGS TO HIS CLOSEST TO THAT TORIES IT MOVED TO THE RIGHT IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. THE VOLUME AND THE PROFILE OF LABOUR'S CAMPAIGNING IS DEFINITELY GOING UP A GEAR JEREMY CORBIN HAS BEEN ON THE STAND THE WHOLE TIME GORDON BROWN IS MAKING SPEECHES ALL OVER THE PLACE
HILARY BENN ALAN JOHNSON THE ENERGY THAT'S GOING INTO THIS CAMPAIGN IS INCREASING THAT'S BECAUSE NOT JUST BECAUSE THE PARTY BY AND LARGE IS VERY PRO IS STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THEY'RE VERY DEEP FEARS INSIDE LABOUR ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARING BACK ON THE DOORSTEP SEVERAL SENIOR FIGURES HAVE TOLD ME THEY'RE REALLY VERY GENUINELY WORRIED THAT MANY MANY LABOUR VOTERS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE UP FOR THE IDEA OF STICKING TWO FINGERS UP TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND VOTING OUT
PARTICULARLY DUE TO THE CONCERNS THEY HAVE OVER IMMIGRATION ONE OF THEIR MOST OUTSPOKEN M.P.S JOHN MANN HAS COME OUT FOR EXIT OVERNIGHT AS THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM ANALYSED IT LAST NIGHT HE SAYS IT'S NOT CRITICISING THE CAMPAIGN BUT THAT IT HAS BEEN TOO MUCH HAMPSTEAD NOT ENOUGH HULL THEY ARE NOT SO FAR MANAGING TO TALK TO YOU AND MOTIVATE ORDINARY LABOUR VOTERS
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW NINE MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AT THE GENERAL ELECTION THERE A HUGE PROPORTION OF THE ELECTORATE MOST PEOPLE THINK THIS REFERENDUM RESULT IS GOING TO BE TIGHT SO IF THE LABOUR VOTE DECIDES TO GO THE OTHER WAY OR HAD TO STAY AT HOME THEN THEY'RE A VERY SIGNIFICANT AND JUSTIFIED FEARS ON THE ROOM MAIN SIDE THAT THIS COULD BE LOST AND AN EXTRAORDINARY THING IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES ARE EVEN SAYING THAT ON THE RECORD WORRIED THAT THEY MIGHT LOSE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT LOT ED MILLIBAND MONITOR YOU MORNING SHE HAS A POINT
WELL THIS REFERENDUM IS IN QUESTION AND THAT'S WHY THE LABOUR MESSAGE HAS GOT TO BE HEARD AND I THINK SO FAR NOT ENOUGH OF OUR VOTERS HAVE HEARD THAT WE ARE FOR IAN AND FOR REMAIN AND WE'RE FOR IT BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY WITH STRONGER FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS WAS STRONGER AND TACKLING THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN THE WORLD WITH STRONGER AND YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A BLUE ON BLUE REFERENDUM IF YOU LIKE
WELL NO BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF LABOUR M.P.S EVERY MAJOR TRADE UNION LEADER OR EX LABOUR LEADERS AND INDEED JEREMY CORBIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PARTY IS FURTHER REMAIN AND YOU KNOW I DO THINK I'M CALLING THIS OUT TODAY JOHN
THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TRYING TO PERPETRATE FRAUD ON LABOUR VOTERS THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY LOOK WE REALLY SHOW YOUR VALUES WHETHER IT'S THE N.H.S. OR WORKERS' RIGHTS L. OR FAIRNESS IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S WHAT WE CARE ABOUT AND WE'VE GOT A CALL THAT OUT AND WE CALL THAT OUT BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY AT THE CUTS THAT WOULD COME FROM THE ECONOMIC SHOCK THAT WOULD HIT THE COUNTRY WOULD HIT LABOUR AREAS HARDEST
BECAUSE THE RECORD OF THESE PEOPLE IN THEIR LEAVE CAMPAIGN IF THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION NOT TO IMPROVE WORKERS' RIGHTS BUT TO SWEEP THEM AWAY AND THAT'S WHY I'M OUT THERE TODAY THAT'S WHY JEREMY IS OUT THERE AND INDIE PEOPLE RIGHT ACROSS THE LABOUR PARTY IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HARD PART OF THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO SO YES WE'VE SEEN MY CORBIN OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HE'S BEEN DOING QUITE A FEW SPEECHES BUT THEY LOOK
BACK AT WHAT HE HAS SAID OVER THE YEARS AND THEY DON'T SEE HIM AS A COMMITTED EURGH EURGH ZEALOT WELL O.K. I'M NOT EVEN IN NO NOT A EURO ZEALOT CERTAINLY BUT I DON'T KNOW THEIR DUBIOUS THEY'RE DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS CREDENTIALS BUT YOU KNOW LOOK HERE'S THE THING I ACTUALLY THINK THAT WHERE JEREMY STANDS WHICH IS HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT SOME PARTS OF THE WAY EUROPE HAS BEHAVED ON CERTAIN ISSUES BUT FEELING FIRMLY WE SHOULD REMAIN
HE'S QUITE CLOSE TO THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN AND YOU KNOW I WAS WITH HIM IN DONCASTER AND IN MY CONSTITUENCY RECENTLY WHERE HE WAS SETTING OUT THE LABOUR CASE AND I THINK HE'S A EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE I KNOW FROM TALKING TO HIM THIS WEEK YOU'VE BEEN GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY WAS IN THE SOUTH WEST AT THE WEEKEND HE'S BEEN IN WALES BEEN SCOTLAND THIS WEEKEND SO HE IS OUT THERE TOO BUT BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING TO ME DE MORE PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THE LABOUR MESSAGE TO MORE LABOUR VOTERS BECAUSE SOME LABOUR VOTERS DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND AT THE MOMENT WHAT ARE THEY
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOT A MESSAGE ACROSS BECAUSE I THINK PART OF IT AS I SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW I'M NOT BLAMING THE MEDIA FOR THIS BUT BUT THE SORT OF SEXY PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE BLUE ON BLUE ACTION IF I CAN PUT IT THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN BORIS JOHNSON AND DAVID CAMERON AND YOU KNOW IN OTHER WORDS THEY'VE BEEN ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION THAT'S WHAT POLITICIANS HAVE TO DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU GAVE ALL THE MYTH OF THEIR DISUNITY BUT BUT LOOK I WANNA SAY TO LABOUR VOTERS
BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO GET ACROSS THIS IS NOT A MID TERM PROTEST THIS IS NOT SOME SUPER BY ELECTION THIS IS THIS IS A ONCE IN A GENERATION DECISION WHICH WILL SHAPE OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COMMON AS SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO WIN THE ELECTION AND FAILED
I KNOW THAT THAT WHEN THERE IS A LABOUR GOVERNMENT I WANTED TO BE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL BE BETTER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE BETTER FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS BETTER FOR OUR ECONOMY AND YOU ARE BETTER ABLE TO TACKLE THE MASSIVE CHALLENGES OF INEQUALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE OF THE BIG BIG FORCES THAT WE FACE AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION IN THAT LITTLE LIST IMMIGRATION AND FOR MANY PEOPLE AS WE NOW KNOW THAT
IS LIKELY COULD BE THE KEY FACTOR IN THIS REFERENDUM BUT MISTER CORBIN DOESN'T WANT TO MENTION IMMIGRATION HE DOESN'T WANTED TO APPEAR ON YOUR LEAFLETS THAT YOU'RE STICKING THROUGH THE DOORS FOR INSTANCE OR SO WE ARE TOLD WHAT I DON'T HAVE A HAD A WRITING THE LEAFLESS ANY MORE TALK TO JEREMY COVERED BUT USED START SURE SURE I DO BUT BUT BUT LET ME JUST BE CLEAR ON IMMIGRATION OR BECAUSE IT IS A CONCERN FOR LABOUR VOTERS I DON'T DISMISS AND INDEED ALL VOTERS I DON'T DISMISS THAT CONCERN BUT WHAT I SAY
DON'T CRATER OUR ECONOMY TO TRY AND DEAL WITH THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THAT IS THE EFFECT CRINKLY YET LOOK LOOK AT ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE LOOK AT WHAT THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES OF THAT ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF AUSTERITY LOOK AT WHAT THE I.M.F. THE O.E.C.D. THE TREASURY HOOK RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD THEY ARE SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY BAD FOR OUR ECONOMY AND IT'S WORKING PEOPLE THERE WOULD BE HIT ANOTHER TWO SAYING LET IT RIP
NOT AT ALL NO I'M NO I'M NOT SAYING THAT I THINK WE'VE GOT A DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S CONCERNS A FOR EXAMPLE WE SHOULD USE THE FACT THAT WHEN MIGRANTS COME HERE THEY CONTRIBUTE MORE IN TAXES THAN THEY THAN HER PAID IN BENEFITS TO HAVE A MIGRATION FUND TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE PRESSURES ON PUBLIC SERVICES WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL UNDERCUTTING OF WAGES THAT TAKE PLACE AND WE CAN DO A LOT MORE TO DO THAT BUT THE OTHER THING WE SHOULDN'T DO IS WE SHOULDN'T USE AND I'M AFRAID THIS IS WHERE
THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN ARE AT FAULT WE SHOULDN'T USE THE PROBLEMS IN THE N.H.S. THE PROBLEMS IN HOUSING OF PROBLEMS THERE FACING THE NEXT GENERATION OUR COUNTRY WE SHOULDN'T USE IMMIGRATION AS THE ALIBI I THINK WE'VE GOT A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT BUT ISN'T ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND WE TAKE THE N.H.S. IN TWENTY TEN WE HAD HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION AND WE HAD RECORD LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IMMIGRATION THAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEMS IN THE N.H.S. I THINK IT'S JEREMY HUNT AND DAVID CAMERON BUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND THEY'RE MAKING IT TERRIBLY CLEAR THE LEAD LOT IS THERE MUST BE LIMITS ON IMMIGRATION MAY BE ONE WAY TO DO IT IS THE AUSTRALIAN WAY AND YOU WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT I'M SURE BUT I WASN'T REALLY HAS HIGHER IMMIGRATE AT THAT THAN BRITAIN PER CAPITA THEY'VE ANOTHER FRAUD I DON'T ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE AUSTRALIA HAS SELECTED THOSE PEOPLE THEY WANTED AND THEY SELECTED THEM ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ABILITIES TO DO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ECONOMY THERE'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ARGUMENT
BUT BUT YOU'RE NOT PREPARED ON THIS IS WHAT WHAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO SAY PRESUMABLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT THERE HAS TO BE A LIMIT TO WHAT I'VE GOT ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN COME INTO THIS COUNTRY WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT
OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION NO THEY DO THEY ARE HOW MANY OR WHAT HANG ON NO HANG ON A MINUTE BECAUSE ACTUALLY COUNTRIES ARE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET LIKE NORWAY LIKES WOULD ALSO HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU AND INDEED LABOUR VOTERS IS THE PRICE WE WOULD PAY OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IN TRADE IN WAGES IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN RECESSION
IT'S A PRICE THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE WILLING TO PAY INSTEAD WE SHOULD TACKLE THE REAL CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT BETTER IN EUROPE BETTER HERE OR AT HOME BUT THAT LET'S NOT LET'S NOT DO DAMAGE UNTOLD DAMAGE TO WORKING PEOPLE AND INDEED A COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO AFFECT THE ISSUES AKATA BUT AS WE SPEAK WITH WHAT THIRTEEN DAYS TO GO YOU THINK THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE IT
MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T VOTED IN THIS REFERENDUM YET THE RESULT IS ALL AS I KNOW FROM THE GENERAL ELECTIONS ON OTHER AS HALTWHISTLE IS IN QUESTION AND YOU KNOW I THINK I'VE GOT OUT OF THE FORECASTING BUSINESS OFF NOT OPTIMISM AS THAT WE DOCTOR NO NO I'M I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN WIN THIS REFERENDUM WE'VE GOT TO GET THE ARGUMENTS ACROSS AND IF YOU MEDAL AND EVERY WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH YET WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHERE LABOUR STANDS I KNOW JEREMY BELIEVES THAT
EVERYBODY NOW PARTY BELIEVE THAT AND THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION FOR OUR COUNTRY I THOUGHT THE LAST GENERAL ELECTION THAT WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT BECAUSE IT WILL SHAPE OUR ABILITY TO AFFECT OUR FUTURE IN PROFOUND WAYS HE'LL SHAKE THE PROSPECTS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN PROFOUND WAYS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE ALL GOT TO BE OUT THERE ED MILIBAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
THAT IS THE SOUND OF DISTURBANCES IN MARSEILLES LAST NIGHT TEAR GAS WAS FIRED DURING SOME LIMITED FIGHTING BETWEEN ENGLAND SUPPORTERS WHO WERE IN THE CITY AHEAD OF ENGLAND'S GAME AGAINST RUSSIA TOMORROW AND LOCAL YOUTHS THE BRITISH POLICEMAN IN CHARGE OF ENGLAND FANS SECURITY EVEN MARSEILLES CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT STEVE NEIL SAID THERE WERE TWO ARRESTS
THE FIRST COUPLE HUNDRED FINES WHO ARRIVED IN MARSEILLES THEY SET UP CAMP IN A COUPLE OF BARS NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPECTED THEY WERE QUITE NOISY AND BOISTEROUS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND EVENING WHICH IS NORMAL
AND THEN ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT THERE'S BEEN A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN A GROUP OF SOME LOCAL YOUTHS POLICE HAVE MOVED IN VERY QUICKLY DISPERSE AND WE'VE SEEN SCENES WHERE THERE WAS TEAR GAS USE WHICH FOR US AS ENGLISH AND U.K. RESIDENTS WERE NOT USED TO SEEING THAT LOOKS FAIRLY DRAMATIC BUT THEY'RE ON EUROPE IT'S A NORMAL TACTIC OATH ENABLES THEM TO DISPERSE THE TWO SET
NOTHING OF THAT SORT ARE HIDDEN HERE IN PARIS YESTERDAY ALTHOUGH PERHAPS THE IS MORE MUTED THAN IN THE LEAD UP TO OTHER MAJOR FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS I'VE COVERED A REFLECTION OF THAT SECURITY FEARS AND THE THREAT OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION THROUGHOUT THE TOURNAMENT I'M GOING TO CHAT TO JOHN MARRIED B. B. C. FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT IN JUST A MOMENT BUT FIRST THAT FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN ALAN SHEARER IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING MORNING
ALAN I DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE SPORT IN IN JUST A SECOND BUT FIRST YOU PLAYED BACK IN THE NINETY EIGHT WORLD CUP HERE IN FRANCE ENGLAND FANS WERE INVOLVED IN RIOTS IN MARSEILLES OR DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I AM WHAT IS IT ABOUT ENGLAND FANS SPECIFICALLY YES A MINORITY BUT THEY OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES AT THE HEART OF TROUBLE YES I HAVE
JUST LIKE YOU THIS MORNING TO THE HEADLINES FOR THE NEWSPAPERS TO THE VIDEOS WHATEVER IT IS DISGUSTING TO TO SEE IT
UNFORTUNATELY THAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN AND EVERY TOURNAMENT ENGLAND GO THROUGH AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS A MINORITY AND IT'S JUST NOT GOOD TO SEE YOU AT ALL IS IT
DOES IT AFFECT THE PLAYERS JUST THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE PLAYERS WE'VE HEARD REPORTS THAT FRANCE IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO BE BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF TERRORISM WELL I ARRIVED IN PARIS A COUPLE OF DAYS ARE GOING TO SEE SAY THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUILDING HERE BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF SECURITY A LOT OF POLICE AROUND WHICH I THINK IS IS INEVITABLE
BUT THAT'S IT WAS IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN AS A SET EVERY EVERY TOURNAMENT WE GO INTO WE WAKE UP ONE MORNING TO SORT OF MINDLESS
FOLKS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S IT IT IT IT TARNISHES A NAME AND A GAME UNFORTUNATE BUT IT IS A MINORITY HOPE HOPEFULLY THAT'S THE LAST WE SEE IF IT ABSOLUTELY LET'S HOPE SO UM LET'S TALK ABOUT ON THE PITCH PROSPECTS FOR ENGLAND
WELL HOPEFUL AREN'T WE I MEAN WITH PEOPLE HE SEEMS A HAPPY HORSE HALL YOU'VE WHISKED UP WITH WE'VE GOT A BIT OF YOUTH ABOUT THIS IN THIS IN THIS SQUAD WE'VE GOT A BIT OF ENERGY I THINK ERM I MEAN I NEVER EVER THOUGHT LESTER WOULD WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT I DON'T THINK ENGLAND WILL WIN THE EUROS EITHER A HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GO IN AND IN AT LEAST IT'S SHORT SOME IMPROVEMENT WHICH SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT
OTHER TOURNAMENTS THAT WE'VE WE'VE ENTERED BOOK I HOPE I'M HOPING WE CAN GIVE A GOOD ACCOUNT OF OURSELVES
I WATCHED THAT FANTASTIC DOCUMENTARY YOU MADE ABOUT THE EURO NINETY SIX TEAM IN WHICH THAT THEY SEEM TO BE GREAT LOVE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS A REAL RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER CERTAINLY THOSE THAT YOU FEATURED DOES THAT EXIST IN THE CURRENT SQUAD DO YOU THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT YOU NEEDED A GOOD TEAM SPIRIT I MEAN AFTER ALL YOU THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE AWAY TOGETHER BONDING TOGETHER LIVING TOGETHER WILL HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN THERE WE'LL HOPEFULLY FOR THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS DEPENDING ON
ONE RESULT SO YOU'VE ALL GOT TO GET ON YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A GREAT TEAM SPIRIT AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE HAD WE CERTAINLY HAD THAT IN IN NINETY SIX WHAT WE ALSO HEART WAS A TEAM FULL OF LEADERS FULL OF CAPTAINS BUT IT JUST WASN'T TO BE ON PENALTIES AGAIN SO WE OPEN OUT THIS ENGLAND TEAM CAN GO ONE STEP FURTHER
AND REPORTS IN THE PAPERS TODAY THAT JAMIE THOUGHT HE MAY NOT PLAY TOMORROW AGAINST RUSSIA YEAH THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF HE DIDN'T START I THINK WILL GO IN WITH A FORMATION VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT THE USED AGAINST GERMANY
A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN THEY HAD A VERY VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE OF JERMYN WON THREE TWO AND IF THAT IS THE CASE AND THAT WOULD MEAN HURRICANE UP FRONT ON HIS OWN WITH MAYBE TWO OR THREE BEHIND
JOHN MURRAY B. B. C. FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT WALES LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO PLAY ENGLAND IN THE SECOND GAME OF THE SORT OF THE SEAMS TOURNAMENT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEIR CHANCES WELL YET OBVIOUSLY
GARETH BALE IS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO HOW WILL'S FAIR AND HE HAS BEEN DURING THE COURSE OF THE QUALIFYING CAMPAIGN
AND YOU THINK YOU ALWAYS SAY ABOUT GARETH BALE IS HE HE DOESN'T DIP OUT OF WALES MATCHES WE HAVEN'T GOT THE BEST DEFENCE ENGLAND HAVE THE WHOLE NO WELL YOU SEE I FEEL WITH ENGLAND THERE ARE AS MANY REASONS TO BE OPTIMISTIC AS THERE ARE TO BE PESSIMISTIC AND THE CONCERN IS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE DEFENCE
AND SO GARETH BILL WILL OBVIOUSLY AND WALES WILL LOOK TO TO TO EXPLOIT THAT
IT ALL DEPENDS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIRST MATCHES THE OPENING MATCHES WILL PROBABLY SET THE TONE FOR THE ENGLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TEAM AND MICHAEL AND NEIL HAS PERFORMED MIRACLES THEN MANAGER PERFORM MIRACLES REALLY IN ORDER TO TO GET THEM INTO A POSITION WHEREBY THEY HAD A CHANCE OF QUALIFYING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT TO GET THEM HERE
REALLY TOUGH GROUP BUT THAT TEAM ETHIC THAT THEY HAVE IS CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF PICKING UP A POINT OR TWO OR MAYBE MORE I MET A COUPLE OF
NORTHERN IRISH FANS YESTERDAY LADS HERE SO EXCITED THEY HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TICKETS THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST HERE AND EXCITED ABOUT IT AND ALAN YOU MENTIONED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUILDING UP I MEAN IT FEELS A BIT MUTED AT THE MOMENT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER TOURNAMENTS BUT BUT PRESUMABLY THE MOMENT THE FRENCH KICK OFF THIS EVENING THEN THE NATION WILL RALLY BEHIND THE CHAMPIONSHIPS YEAH I'M SURE THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE AS A SET I ARRIVED IN PARIS A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THE ATMOSPHERE IS SLOWLY BUT SURELY BUILDING
I THINK EVERYONE'S GETTING EXCITED AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS TO THIS FIRST GAME ONCE IT KICKS OFF THEN THEN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO AND KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED AND HOPE AND PRAY LIKE WE DID WITH EVERY OTHER TOURNAMENT HASN'T WORKED UP TILL NOW KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED BUT BUT LET'S DO IT AGAIN ALAN SHEARER THANKS SO MUCH AND THEY GOT MURRAY AS WELL
TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST IT IS POSSIBLE ROB THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WHO WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT ARTICULATE EVENT I SUPPOSE I DO CHANT YES GOOD MORNING AS YOU'VE JUST BEEN HEARING FIRST MATCH IF YOU ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN TODAY JUNE THE TENTH HOUSE FRANCE AGAINST ROMANIA IN PARIS THE FINAL EXACTLY A MONTH AWAY ON JULY THE TENTH BUT MORE IMMEDIATELY THE BUSINESS OF GETTING OUT OF THE QUALIFYING GROUPS NORTHERN IRELAND WILL MEET POLAND UKRAINE AND GERMANY IN THEIR EFFORTS TO REACH THE LAST SIXTEEN
WHILE ENGLAND AND WALES JOIN IN THE SAME GROUP B. WAS FACE RUSSIA AND SLOVAKIA THIS WEEKEND AS WELL AS EACH OTHER NEXT THURSDAY FOR ENGLAND A QUARTER FINAL PLACE IS REGARDED AS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT BUT WHAT OF WALES' LAST PRESENT AMONGST FOOTBALL'S ELITE IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT WITH REAL MADRID GARETH BALE AS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING A POTENTIAL MATCH WINNER AND THE TEAM FIRED UP WITH THE SLOGAN TOGETHER STRONGER AND PASSIONATE PATRIOTIC MANAGER CHRIS COLEMAN HAS ANOTHER SLOGAN FOR HIS TOURNAMENT STRATEGY
FIRE IN THE BELLY ICE IN THEIR MIND SO YOU MUST NEVER LOSE THE PASSION THAT'S FOR SURE LEFT OF SELF MOTIVATION BUT THEN I THOUGHT OF A PLAN
YOU HAVE TO BE A CLEAR THINKER SOMETIMES IT DON'T SEEM CLEAR AT ALL SOMETIMES IT'S VERY MESSY AND CLOUDY BUT THAT'S AS MUCH HOW MESSY DOES IT GET EXTREMELY MESSY APPROACH IT AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES BUT YOU NEVER LOSE THAT PASSION NOT HONESTLY NATION ANYWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE IF TACTICALLY SOMETIMES IN THE GAME WHEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE THINGS ROUND MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO IT POSITIVELY AND IF YOU THINK IT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GO WITH THAT
ONE OF THE PLAYERS FEEL ABOUT PASSION FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND SO MANY PLAYERS IN THE PAST WE'VE LEARNT
ACTUALLY SAY I'M PAID BY MY CLUB I PLAY ABOVE ALL FOR MY CLUB BUT SOMETIMES FORCED INTO THAT ATTITUDE BY THEIR CLUB MANAGERS BUT HAVE YOU MANAGED TO INCULCATE THAT PASSION INTO YOUR SQUAD
I THINK CERTAIN PLAYERS MAY THINK LIKE THAT GLAD WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY OF THEM WITH US OF COURSE
EFFECTIVELY WE BORROW THE PLAYERS THEY DON'T BELONG TO US YOU KNOW THEIR DOOR BELONG TO THE CLUB'S A CONTRACT TO THE CLUBS AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WE'VE HAD GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH CLUBS BECAUSE WE WON THEY COME WITH US HIS DUTY OF CARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE SEND THEM
IN THE SAME CONDITION AS WE RECEIVE AN UNFORTUNATE ESPECIALLY BACK TO ROMAN DRESS THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT FOOT WILL BE A FOOTBALL THINGS HAPPEN BUT I THINK WE'RE LUCKY WE'VE GOT A BUNCH OF PERIODIC BOYS A LOT OF THEM ARE YOUNG DO YOU GOT A LOT TO LEARN A LOT IN FRONT OF THEM BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY GOOD PLAYERS ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IF PROVE THAT AND THERE'S MORE TO COME FROM THIS BUNCH AND THEY LOVE PLAYING FOR THEIR COUNTRY SO WE'RE IN THE FORTUNATE POSITION I SUPPOSE YOUR GROUP OPPONENTS WILL BE EXPECTING YOU TO BUILD THE TEEN AROUND GARETH BALE
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT ABSOLUTELY WE'RE NOT DAFT WE ALL KNOW GARETH BEERS AND THERE'S A SPAIN IN THE TEAM ISN'T IT WITH JO ALAN AND WAYNE HENNESSEY RIGHT RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE TEAM AND THAT ALL PLAYING TOP LEVEL FOOTBALL THIS IN ANY MANAGER
ANYBODY THAT'S GOOD STAFF AN IDEA ABOUT FOOTBALL IN KNOW YOU NEED A STRONG SPAIN WHAT GAS BELL SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO TWENTY SIXTEEN JUST TURN UP AND TO TAKE PART ON THE RECORD HE WANTS TO WIN IT I MEAN IS THAT REALISTIC I THINK FOOTBALL IN A COMPETITION LIKE THE ONE WE'RE GOING INTO WHERE WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THE GROUP
GET OUT OF THE GROUP YES ON THAT ONE OFF GAME
STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN THEN YOU NEVER NEVER KNOW I MEAN FOR US TO MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT I THINK THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT BUT FOR US TO SAY WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AS BEST AS WE CAN IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF THE GROUP
BY BEATING ENGLAND WHILE I THINK ENGLAND'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH TESSA'S BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S SLOVAKIA THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BIG TEST FOR US YOU KNOW THAT FEAR SCHEME FOR EVERYBODY IS A TOUGH ONE CERTAINLY FOR COUNTRIES WILL NEVER BEEN IN THE TOURNAMENT
SO YOU WON'T TAKE THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BEAT ENGLAND BUT BE ELIMINATED AT THE GROUP STAGE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT ONE MATCH NOT THAT THAT WILL MARK THERE AT ALL TO ME
WE BEAT ENGLAND BUT WE DON'T GO THROUGH THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF OUR HOWEVER THE ENGLAND RESULT GOES IT GOES IT'S ALL ABOUT ACCUMULATE IN THE POINTS WE NEED TO GET THROUGH THAT'S WHY WE'RE THERE THAT'S WHERE WE DONE ALL THE HARD WORK IS NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WE'VE QUALIFIED WITH THE FIRST TEAM TO QUALIFY SINCE FIFTY EIGHT THAT'LL GRIP THAT'S DONE THIS FINISHED
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NEXT AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THIS TOURNAMENT THAN CAN WE PERFORM IT WITH THE BEST TEAMS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WHEN THE GENERAL OBSERVATION IS YOU KNOW IS THAT ENGLAND HAVE A SHAKY DEFENCE
I TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT THEY'VE GOT A GOOD TEAM I KNOW THAT THEY'VE GOT A VERY GOOD MANAGER BUT EXPERIENCE MANAGER WHO'S BEEN AT TOURNAMENTS BEFORE THEY'VE GOT GOOD PLAYERS I KNOW THERE'LL BE PRESSURE ON ENGLAND THERE ALWAYS HAS GONE INTO THE TOURNAMENT BUT THERE WILL STILL BE A TEAM THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT AND FEAR BECAUSE IF ENGLAND CAN GET IT RIGHT WITH THE PLAYERS UP THEY'VE GOTTEN CAPABLE OF BEATING ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

THE FORMER LABOUR LEADER ED MILIBAND WHO USE OF SPEECH TO WARN OF A CONSERVATIVE SHIFT TO THE RIGHT IN THE EVENT OF A BRECK'S IT VOTE HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM WAS IN QUESTION AND NOT ENOUGH VOTERS AT HER THAT LABOUR SUPPORTS REMAINING IN THE E.U. MY BURNS AT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SHOULDN'T USE IMMIGRATION AS THE ALIBI FOR PROBLEMS IN THE N.H.S. AND HOUSING

SCIENTISTS IN CANADA ARE REPORTING ENCOURAGING RESULTS FROM A RADICAL WAY OF TREATING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS THE PROCEDURE INVOLVES USING CHEMOTHERAPY TO DESTROY A PATIENT'S IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THEN REBUILDING IT USING STEM CELLS
THANKSGIVING SERVICE IS BEING HELD IN LONDON THIS MORNING TO MARK THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL NINETIETH BIRTHDAY SHE HAD NINETY IN APRIL PRINCE PHILIP IS NINETY FIVE TODAY
TWENTY FIVE TO NINE KT TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO SIX MEN WERE SHOT DEAD WHILE THEY WERE WATCHING THE WORLD CUP FOOTBALL MATCH IN A PUB IN NORTHERN IRELAND THEY COLOURS WORK LOYALIST GUNMEN MEMBERS OF THE U.V.F. YESTERDAY THE NORTHERN IRELAND OMBUDSMAN FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN COLLUSION BETWEEN THEM AND SOME POLICE OFFICERS THEY HAD EFFECTIVELY BEEN PROTECTED BY THE POLICE
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY IT WAS SOME VINDICATION AFTER A CAMPAIGN THAT THEY'D BEEN WAITING EVER SINCE THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY JEFFREY DONALDSON WHO'S D. U. P. M. P. AND BY EMMA ROGAN WHO'S THE DAUGHTER OF ADRIAN ROGUE AND HE WAS THE YOUNGEST VICTIM OF
THAT MASS MURDER HE DIED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY FOUR MISS ROGUE AND YOUR REACTION TO WHAT THE OMBUDSMAN FOUND YESTERDAY
MY REACTION WAS FIRST ONE OF EUPHORIA THAT WE GOT THE TRACE EVENTUALLY IT QUICKLY TURNED TO ONE OF
ANGER WHEN WHEN YOU READ THE REPORT AND WHAT DETAIL THE LOT IT'S A HARD TRUTH TO HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH
BUT YOU HAD SUSPECTED ALL ALONG THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF PROTECTION FOR THESE GUNMEN
WE HAD THEM WE ALWAYS HAD A SUSPICION THAT THERE WAS A POLICE INFORMER IS ON AND THE COLLISION HAD TAKEN PLACE BUT NOT TO THE GRAVITY THAT AT IT IT HAS BEEN FINED IN THE REPORT BY DOCTOR MCGUIRE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW IN YOUR VIEW
AND IF THERE'S ANY POTENTIAL FOR ANYBODY TO BE ARRESTED THEY SHOULD BE
UNLESS FAMILIES AND THERE'S THIS RIVA IS WE SHOULD HAVE AN APOLOGY FROM THE BRITISH STATE FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE MURDER OF HER LOVED ONES
THE ROLE OF THE BRITISH DON'T YEP THERE BUT THE AGENTS POLICE INFORMANTS
FROM THE VERY GUNS TO THE CARD TO THE PEOPLE ARE PERPETRATED THIS TO THE POLICE COVERING UP
POLICE TALLY SUSPECTS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ARRESTED THE NIGHT BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT THEY THEY WERE DUE TO BE ARRESTED
YOU HAVE NO DOUBT BUT THAT THOSE POLICE OFFICERS WHO
AND PROTECTED THE GUNMEN WERE
GETTING THEIR ORDERS FROM PEOPLE WHO WILL STRETCH ALL THE WAY TO WESTMINSTER IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABSOLUTELY THIS GOES TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL
YES THIS HAS BEEN COVERED UP BY AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IF THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THAT WOULDN'T BE OMBUDSMAN FOUND IT HE WAS AFTER ALL THE REPORT RATHER WAS PRETTY FRANK AND IT AND IT WAS A PRETTY DETAILED REPORT WASN'T IT IT WAS ANNA DETAILED THAT THEIR WEAPONS THAT WERE USED IN THE MURDER OF MY FATHER WERE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY IN A SHIPMENT THAT WAS OVERSEEN BY A BRITISH STATE YOU DON'T
SO YOU WANT THOSE PEOPLE ALL OF THEM AT THE VERY LEAST EXPOSED AND IDEALLY BROUGHT TO JUSTICE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT TO SEE THEM IN COURT
ABSOLUTELY AND I WANT AN APOLOGY TO MAC TO MY FAMILY AND TO THE SURVIVORS THANK YOU JEFFREY DONALDSON SHOULD THAT HAPPEN
WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT EMMA'S FATHER ADRIAN WAS AN INNOCENT VICTIM THAT THIS MURDER WAS APPALLING AND THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND AFFAIR EVIDENCE CAN BE FOUND PROSECUTE THEM I WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPENING AS I DO FOR ALL INNOCENT VICTIMS IN NORTHERN IRELAND
IN RELATION TO ANY POLICE WRONGDOING AGAIN IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THEN THOSE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS WE DO NOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO WRONGDOING THAT IS VERY CLEAR
HOWEVER I WOULD WANT AT THE SAME TIME TO DEFEND THE USE OF INFORMANTS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY IN NORTHERN IRELAND BECAUSE THE POLICE AND THE SECURITY FORCES SUCCESSFULLY INFILTRATED AT LOYALIST AND REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS AND INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED BY THOSE INFORMANTS HELP TO PROTECT MANY LIVES HELPED PREVENT MANY MURDERS THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE ANY COVER UP
THE OMBUDSMAN WAS ALSO CLEAR THE POLICE DID NOT KNOWN ADVANCE THAT THIS ATTACK WAS GOING TO OCCUR AT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THEY COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT BUT IF THERE WERE SOME IN THE POLICE WHO SOUGHT TO EITHER COVER UP OR TO PROTECT MURDERERS THEN CLEARLY IF THE EVIDENCE CAN BE FOUND OF WRONGDOING THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AND YOU HEARD EMMA ROGAN SAYING A MOMENT AGO THAT THE EVIDENCE IS THERE IN THAT REPORT
WELL THERE IS INFORMATION IN THE REPORT AND OF COURSE AS DOCTOR MCGUIRE HIMSELF HAS SAID WHEN HE WAS ASKED HAD HE REPORTED AT ANY OF THIS TO THE POLICE AND TERMS OF PROSECUTIONS HE SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO GET THE EVIDENCE TO SECURE A PROSECUTIONS AND EVIDENCE IS THE TEST THAT NEEDS TO BE MAPPED IN TERMS OF ANYONE BEING PROSECUTED
IF THAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THEN OF COURSE IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE POLICE WERE AT THE LAWFUL AUTHORITY ON THEY SHOULD INVESTIGATE ANY WRONGDOING SHOULD THERE BE AN APOLOGY BY THE GOVERNMENT WELL
THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS REPORT THAT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT TOOK A DECISION TO COVER UP THIS MURDER AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WHO ACTED IN A WAY THAT WAS WRONG BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
THAT THERE WAS A GOVERNMENT COLLUSION IN THERE SIT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT THEMSELVES WERE INVOLVED IN TAKING DECISIONS THAT LED TO PEOPLE AVOIDING PROSECUTION BUT IF PEOPLE HAVE HAD INFORMATION EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT THEN THEY NEED TO BRING IT FORWARD BUT AT THE MOMENT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE REPORT SAYS JEFFREY DONALDSON AND EMMA ARE GOING THANK YOU BOTH

THE EYES ON US TO DAUGHTERS ACTION I THINK THAT WOULD START AND I THINK EVERYBODY WILL ENJOY THE TOURNAMENT HAS BEEN A VERY TOUGH TWENTY FIFTEEN YEAR FOR US WITH ORDER TERRORIST ATTACKS AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE SOMETHING TO CHEER RECEPTOR PUT SMILES BACK ON OUR FACES AND TO GET TOGETHER HAVE A BIG PARTY WITH THE REST OF EUROPE SO I THINK WE DO
ANY COMING HERE I MEAN HAVE YOU BEEN NERVOUS ABOUT YOU WILL HAVE SEEN THE ATTACKS IN PARIS LAST YEAR HAS THAT FEED THROUGH TO INTO A NERVOUSNESS ON YOUR PART ABOUT COMING HERE AT ALL ERM I THINK THERE IS A NERVOUSNESS OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO FRESH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD THAT NECESSARILY STOPS PEOPLE FROM COMING TO FRANCE AND WANT TO ENJOY WHAT IS VERY POSITIVE
TOURNAMENT AND FOOTBALL ALWAYS HAS THAT EFFECT OF UNITING PEOPLE AND MAKING PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT WHAT IS QUITE SCARY QUITE SCARY THING BUT I THINK IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE SECURITY HAS STEPPED UP HERE AND HE'S PROBABLY IRONICALLY PROBABLY THIS ONE OF THE SAFEST TIME TO COME TO FRANCE BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S JUST ON HIGH ALERT AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
THERE'S A LOT OF POLICE OUT ON THE STREETS WE'VE GOT NINETY THOUSAND EXTRA SECURITY PERSONNEL OUT ON THE STREETS AROUND FRANCE OVERALL YEAH I MEAN IN TERMS OF KICK OFF TONIGHT FRANCE ROMANIA YOU WERE JUST SAYING JUST NOW YOU'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS I CAN'T

ANY WHEN I SPOKE TO LEWIS FORMER FRENCH INTERNATIONAL A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HERE IN PARIS AND HE'S BEEN ON THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING AS WELL HE WAS SAYING THAT THE FRENCH DEFENCE IT'S WHAT WORRIES HIM
BUT WE ALWAYS SAY THAT ABOUT ENGLAND AS WELL WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE CHART ENGLAND COULD MEET FRANCE IN THE FINAL YEAH IS IT GOING TO BE AMAZING SO I THINK I MEAN I CERTAINLY THINK IT WILL DO WELL IN THE TOURNAMENT AND I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
GETTING TO THE FINAL AND I THINK THEY'LL GET TO THE SEMI FINAL BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I I THINK YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT BACK FOUR AND IT'S IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY WEAKER THAN THEIR ATTACKER THINK FRANCE HAVE GOT AN AMAZING ATTACKING MIDFIELDER AS WELL AS AS AS A STRIKE FORCE OR YOU LOOK AT EVER
THEY DO LACK PACE AND SO I'LL GET THE TEAM IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN AS FAR AS THE BOOK AND I THINK RIGHTLY SO I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PLAYERS IN THE FRENCH SQUAD I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE HAD SUCH GREAT SEASONS WHEN YOU LOOK AT POG
ET MA CHAILL ZERO WAS CRITICISED A LOT BUT ACTUALLY FINISHED IN THE TOP FIVE SCORES IN LEAGUE WITH EIGHTEEN GOALS YOU LOOK AT THESE GUYS AND THEY'VE ALL HAD FANTASTIC SEAS AND I'M GOING TO COME TODAY THESE SOME OF THEM WON'T EVEN GET INTO THE STARTING LINE UP ALL RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT AN ENGLAND WOMEN'S FOOTBALLER TALKING UP THE FRENCH SIZE THAT SORT OF A FRENCH JOURNALIST AND SPORTSWRITER TALKING UP THE ENGLAND SIDE ENGLAND'S CHANCES MY PREDICTION IS THAT THEY WERE IN FRANCE IN THE FINAL
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY DOOBA NO HIGHER IF WE CAN FIND THE BIBLE AS BETWEEN THE YOUNGER PLAYERS THE MOST EXPENSE PLAYER IF YOU HAVE THE KEY PLAYERS LIKE ROONEY ARE THEY BEST I THINKING ANOTHER A VERY GOOD
AND DOES FIVE HARDY WORRY OTHER PLAYERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES HE'S HAD SUCH A GREAT SEASON FOR LESS THAT YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD

WE WILL NOTE WE NOTICED YOU CORRECTED THE WEE INTO ENGLAND GOING TO BE YOU'LL BE SUPPORTING WALES BUT
INDEPENDENT OF THE OF COURSE SIX SPICS THAN I KNOW IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT HE'S NEVER BEEN A MONARCH AS WELL TRAVELLED AS THE QUEEN EAST I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT'S NOT A BRITISH MONARCH IT IS HER OFFICIAL BIRTHDAY TODAY OF COURSE AND AT THE AGE OF NINETY
IT WOULD BE SURPRISING IF SHE WEREN'T SLOWING DOWN A BIT WHAT DO THEY MAKE OF HER IN THE VAST NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THAT SHE HAS VISITED OVER THE YEARS WHILE I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY TWO PEOPLE WITH VIEWS ON THAT CATHERINE ARNOLD IS THE CURRENT BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO MONGOLIA AND DAME MARGARET ANSTEY WAS SHE GOES BACK A VERY LONG TIME I'LL GIVE AWAY YOUR BIRTHDAY FOR MAY DAY MARGARET YOU WERE YOU WERE BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX SO WHAT A VINTAGE YEAR YOU AND THE QUEEN
WELL YES THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SEE IT AS A GREEN SOMETIME ADDING THAT ESPECIALLY ON THE DISTAFF SIDE GO ON MORNING FROM THE WELSH MARCHES WELL DONE EXCELLENT NOW YOU WERE A DIPLOMAT AWAY BACK IN THE FORTIES UNITED NATIONS REPRESENTED GO ANGOLA YOU WORK ALL OVER THE PLACE IN FACT I THINK YOU'VE TRAVELLED POSSIBLY TO MORE COUNTRIES EVEN ON THE QUEEN
WELL I HEARD YOU DON'T ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BRIDGES NOT BAD MY LAST TASK WAS ABOUT
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY GOOD HEAVENS SO I BEAT AND I LIVED AT OF COURSE MORE THAN A DOZEN MOSTLY OF COURSE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BACKWARD AND OFTEN IN CONFLICT
NOW WHAT ABOUT THE QUEEN WHAT FIRST OF ALL LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SORT OF GARDEN PARTY IS A KIND OF THINGS WERE YOU BROUGHT ALL THE EX PATS TOGETHER AND CATHERINE ARE PRESUMABLY YOU ARE STILL DOING THIS TODAY AS ARE YOU
WE ARE INDEED GOOD MORNING MONGOLIA ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY MUCH THE AFTERNOON IN HERE YES WE HOSTED A QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY PARTY ON WEDNESDAY BUT IT ISN'T JUST FOR EXPERTS IT'S VERY MUCH FOR SENIOR MONGOLIANS BE THEY IN GOVERNMENT
SENIOR THEN AND OF COURSE ALL THE BRITISH COMPANIES ARE BRITISH N.G.O. WORKERS WHO ARE HERE IN MONGOLIA AND WHEN YOU INVITE THEM THE MONGOLIANS I'M TALKING ABOUT NO RATHER THAN THE EXPATS OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU INVITE THEM ARE THEY SLIGHTLY PUZZLED AT THE IDEA OF GOING TO A PARTY AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTHDAY OF THE QUEEN
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE PUZZLED I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED I THINK ALONG WITH MANY OBVIOUSLY THE COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES CELEBRATE THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY BUT ALONG WITH MANY COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD THERE'S A HUGE RESPECT AND FASCINATION FOR THE BRITISH MONARCHY HERE IN MONGOLIA IN FACT ONE OF MY GUEST PRESENTED ME WITH A FIRST DAY COVER ISSUES OF SOME STAMPS
FROM THE MONGOLIAN POST IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN TO CELEBRATE THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE'S WEDDING SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE VERY FACT THAT THE MONGOLIAN POSTERS PRODUCING STAMPS ABOUT A ROYAL FAMILY GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THEIR PROFILE AROUND THE WORLD ABSOLUTELY HOW EXTRAORDINARY I HOPE YOU CATCH THEM WITH THAT YEAH THERE MARGARET
I AGREE WITH THAT I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY THAT CELEBRATES A NATIONAL DAY IT'S A LONG DIPLOMATIC TRADITION AND AS THE AMBASSADOR SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL TO FLY THE FLAG SECOND DELAY IN ORDER TO
YOU COULD HAVE INFORMAL CONTACT WITH PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HELPS MATTERS CONSIDERABLY BRINGS THE BRITISH COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND IT WAS THE SIZE OF IT DEPENDS ON THE COUNTRY BUT IS CELEBRATED IN SOME PLACES WHERE THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE IN CONFLICT OR WEAR OF THE BRITISH COMMUNITY IS VERY SMALL
YEAH AND THINK YES GOOD NO I WAS GOING TO SAY I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I MEAN A BIRTHDAY PARTY CELEBRATION WITH WITH ATTENDED BY THE MONGOLIAN FOREIGN MINISTER
AND THAT GAVE ME A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE IMPERSONATOR A FEW OF THE BRITISH ORGANISATIONS THAT ARE WORKING HERE SUCH AS LONDON ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY COUNTERING THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE THROUGH TO D'OH A DELEGATION WE HAD FROM THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE'S THINK TANK WHO ARE OUT HERE TO DISCUSS MONGOLIANS ROLE PEACEKEEPING AROUND THE WORLD ON WHICH THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE SO IT'S A WONDERFUL WAY NOT ONLY TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD FOR BRITISH INTERESTS OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT ALSO TO CREATE NEW CONTACTS AND OF COURSE
WITH EXPORTS HIGH ON THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA A WONDERFUL WAY TO PROMOTE BRITISH BUSINESS HERE IN A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET DEMOTED I WONDER HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE MANY MANY YEARS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND HOW ATTITUDES TO THE ROYAL FAMILY TO THE QUEEN SPECIFICALLY HAVE CHANGED
WELL I HAD I THINK THEY HAVE PERHAPS BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMAL BUT
HAVE TO SAY THAT WHENEVER I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF THESE OCCASIONS THERE IS GREAT RESPECT OF COURSE SPECIALLY FOR THE CREEK WITH THE GREEN AND ALSO FOR THE U.K. BUT DON'T LET'S FORGET THAT EVERY COUNTRY HAS ITS OWN NATIONAL DAY AS THE HEAD OF THE U.N. MISSION IN VARIOUS PLACES I HAD TO GIVE SOMETHING A RECEPTION ON URINE DAY WHICH ALSO SERVED A SIMILAR PURSE
A SIMILAR PURPOSE INTERNATIONALLY BUT I WONDER SOMETIMES IT'S VERY FRAUGHT ON ONE OCCASION IN ONE COUNTRY
MINERS WERE POISED TO COME DOWN INTO THE CITY AND ARM OF A REVOLUTION AND THE GOVERNMENT I WAS WANTING TO CANCEL THE PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT RANG UP AND SAID PLEASE PLEASE DON'T WE WANT TO TRY AND PRETEND THAT EVERYTHING IS NORMAL
AND SO A FEW INTREPID PEOPLE DID COME AND BE SERVED ANOTHER PURPOSE THERE WELL IT AT THE SAME QUESTION TO YOU CATHERINE ARNOLD ANYTHING CHANGED OVER THE YEARS OF COURSE I KNOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST AMBASSADORIAL POSE BUT BUT I WANT TO WORK WHETHER YOU'RE SPORTING A BIT OF A CHANGE AND WHETHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING WILL IT BE THE SAME AFTER THIS QUEEN DEPART
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WHO SAY THAT I THINK IT'S THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT IN MANY WAYS I THINK YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THANK YOU AND THE U.K. HAVE BEEN IN MONGOLIA FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS SO IT'S DEFINITELY CHANGED THE WAY WE DO IT THANK YOU CATHERINE ALL DAY MARGARET THANK YOU BOTH AND GOOD MORNING FROM ALL OF US
