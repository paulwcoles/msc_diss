AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME I RESPECT WOMEN INCREDIBLY I HAD A WOMAN WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE BUILDING OF TRUMP TOWER BEFORE ANYBODY WOULD HAVE EVEN THOUGHT OF IT I DID A FANTASTIC JOB
WELL HE DOESN'T NORMALLY NAME HER ON HIS STUMP SPEECHES BUT I HAVE TRACKED HER DOWN THE WOMAN WHO BUILT TRUMP TOWER AND ASKED HER WHAT DONALD TRUMP REALLY DOES THINK ABOUT WEIRD PLUS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING FIGURES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TELLS US ABOUT CREATING MACHINES
THERE ARE SMARTER THAN THE SMARTEST HUMANS AND THE ACTRESS TURNED PRODUCER JEMMA ASHTON TELLS US WHERE THE REAL POWER LIES
THERE'S BEEN TIMES WHERE I'VE GONE INTO A MEETING WITH THE FINANCIER AND THERE AND IT'S A FILM ABOUT A WOMAN AND THEY SAY YEAH BUT CAN WE WRITE UP THE MANX OTHERWISE WE WON'T FINANCE IT AND I'M LIKE NO IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN FROM THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY SUSAN
THE TURKISH PRESIDENT REG IT TIE AIR DO AVON HAS RESPONDED DEFIANTLY TO YESTERDAY'S CAR BOMBING IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA WHICH KILLED THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE HE SAID THE ATTACK THE THIRD IN RECENT MONTHS BOLSTERED THE COUNTRY'S DETERMINATION TO FIGHT TERRORISM THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID THE PERPETRATOR IS THOUGHT TO BE KURDISH REBELS HAD TARGETED CIVILIANS WAITING FOR BUSES MARK LOWE AND HAS BEEN MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS FROM ISTANBUL
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS INITIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE ATTACK SHOULD CONCLUDE TODAY BY WHICH TIME EVER RELEASE THE NAME OF THE GROUP IT BELIEVES WAS BEHIND IT INITIAL INDICATION SAY OFFICIALS POINT TO THE P.K.K. THE KURDISH GUERRILLA GROUP WITH WHICH THE STATE HAS BEEN FIGHTING A RENEWED CONFLICT SINCE LAST JULY A P.K.K. OFFSHOOT SAID IT WAS BEHIND LAST MONTH'S CAR BOMB IN ANKARA
PRESIDENT ADD ONE SAID THE ATTACKS THREATEN TURKEYS INTEGRITY AND UNITY BUT DO NOT WEAKEN ITS RESOLVE VOWING TO BRING TERRORISM TO ITS KNEES THERE WILL THEY BE SERIOUS QUESTIONS OVER HIS GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SECURITY AFTER THREE ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL IN FIVE MONTHS
AN ANTI IMMIGRATION PARTY HAS MADE BIG GAINS IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN GERMANY IN WHAT'S BEING SEEN AS A SHARP REBUKE BY VOTERS TO ANGELA MERKEL'S OPEN DOOR POLICY ON REFUGEES THE CHANCELLOR C.D.U. PARTY SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES AT THE HANDS OF THE ALTERNATIVE FOR DUTCH HAND PARTY THE F. D. IT WON SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS OF ALL THREE STATES THAT VOTED IN YESTERDAY'S ELECTIONS HERE'S OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT JENNY HILL
I'M GOING MERKEL ONCE DISMISSED ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND AS A SMALL FRINGE PARTY IT'S A COMMENT SHE MAY NOW REGRET A.F. DE IS FIERCELY OPPOSED TO HER REFUGEE POLICY ITS LEADER RECENTLY SUGGESTED BORDER GUARDS SHOULD SHOOT AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND IT MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN YESTERDAY'S ELECTIONS IN ONE STATE IT ONE NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE VOTE
FIFTIES ELECTORAL SUCCESS THAT WORRIES MANY HERE THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST TABLOID NEWSPAPER BUILT IS RUNNING THE HEADLINE NIGHTMARE FOR GERMANY
A PROPOSED DEAL TO END THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS RUNNING INTO SERIOUS LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES UNDER THE AGREEMENT TURKEY WOULD TAKE BACK ALL ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS ARE THE E. YOU WOULD ACCEPT AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SYRIANS FROM TURKISH CAMPS THE DEAL WAS DUE TO BE FINALISED AT A SUMMIT LATER THIS WEEK BUT IT FACES CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION AS OUR EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS
THE DRAFT DEAL HAS RUN INTO A STORM OF PROTEST FROM THE U.N. AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS WHO DESCRIBED IT AS IMMORAL AND ILLEGAL LAWYERS ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEVISE A PLAN THAT WOULD HELP MEET THE E. USE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS THE RIGHT OF ANYONE SEEKING ASYLUM TO APPEAL AGAINST THEIR RETURN TO TURKEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE GUARANTEED AND EVERY CASE WOULD HAVE TO BE HEARD INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE A TRIBUNAL
THE PROPOSED DEAL ALSO INCLUDES NUMEROUS INCENTIVES FOR TURKEY BUT SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES ARE UNHAPPY THEY CAN BE NO SHORT CUT THEY INSIST TO VISA FREE TRAVEL FOR TURKEY CITIZENS TO THE SHAMAN AREA
THE ISLAMIST GROUP I'LL COLLIDER IN THE ISLAMIC MCGRATH HAS SAID IT CARRIED OUT A GUN ATTACK ON A BEACH RESORT IN IVORY COAST YESTERDAY FOURTEEN CIVILIANS AND TWO SOLDIERS DIED IN THE ASSAULT ON GRAND BY SOME SIX GUNMEN WERE KILLED WITNESSES SAYS MUST SAID MUST GUNMAN FIRST STARTED SHOOTING TOURISTS ON THE BEACH AND THEN MOVED INTO HER TALES
ANOTHER ROUND OF PEACE TALKS AIMED AT ENDING THE FIVE YEAR CONFLICT IN SYRIA IS DUE TO BEGIN IN GENEVA TODAY NEITHER OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT NO THE OPPOSITION ARE SHOWING ANY SIGN OF COMPROMISE OVER THE KEY ISSUE OF THE FUTURE OF PRESIDENT ASAD
THE GOVERNMENT IS LAUNCHING AN INITIATIVE TO ENCOURAGE LOW INCOME WORKERS TO SAVE MORE FOR HELP TO SAVE SCHEME TO BE SET OUT TODAY BY THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE OPEN TO AROUND THREE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT OF WORKING TAX CREDIT MORE DETAILS FROM OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
THE HELP TO SAVE SCHEME AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE THE VERY LOWEST PAID TO PUT MONEY ASIDE EACH MONTH BY OFFERING A BONUS OF FIFTY PER CENT UP TO A MAXIMUM OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS OF WHAT THEY'VE SAVED AFTER TWO YEARS AFTER ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF SAVING THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANOTHER BONUS AGAIN UP TO SIX HUNDRED POUNDS
THE MONEY COULD BE SPENT ON ANYTHING THE SAVER WANTED BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THE SCHEME IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS SUGGEST MINISTERS DON'T EXPECT MANY OF THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR IT TO PARTICIPATE
THE HIGH COURT IS EXPECTED TO DECIDE TODAY ON A LEGAL CHALLENGE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SEEKING TO HER SEEKING TO BAN A ONE DAY STRIKE TOMORROW BY SIXTH FORM COLLEGE LECTURERS IN ENGLAND MINISTERS SAY THE DISPUTE WHICH IS ABOUT THE FUNDING OF COLLEGES IS POLITICAL

THANKS SO MUCH STAB IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGES OF THE PAPERS AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ACROSS ITS FRONT PAGE HAS BORAGE BORIS BORAGE BORIS RAGE AT HYPOCRITE OBAMA THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY THAT BORIS JOHNSON HAS WRITTEN FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HE WRITES FOR THEM REGULARLY BUT HE HAS TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO DELIVER A BROADSIDE AGAINST BARACK OBAMA WHO IS INTENDING TO COME TO BRITAIN AND TO SUGGEST TO US THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
HIS PLAN TO URGE VOTED TO REMAIN NEAR OPINION IS A PIECE OF OUTRAGEOUS AND EXORBITANT HYPOCRISY BORIS JOHNSON SAYS AND THE REASON IS THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO THE KIND OF DILUTION OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT EUROPE ENTAILS SO CITES AMONG OTHER THINGS THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT IN THE HAGUE THE U.S. DOES NOT ALLOW ITS CITIZENS TO BE INVOLVED WITH THEY HAVEN'T EVEN SIGNED UP TO THE CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA
BORIS JOHNSON SAYS HER CAN YOU IMAGINE THE AMERICAN SUBMITTING THEIR DEMOCRACY TO THE KIND OF REGIME THAT WE HAVE IN THE AND THE TIMES AND THE MAIL BOTH LEAD ON THE NEWS IT FROM GERMANY THE BIG ELECTIONS THERE OF COURSE MERKEL LEFT WOUNDED AS GERMANS TURN WRITERS HOW THE TIMES PUT IT THE SO CALLED SUPER SUDDENLY ELECTIONS REGIONAL ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE IN GERMANY
IN WHICH THE ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY A. F. D. DID SO WELL THE ELECTIONS INVOLVING ABOUT A FIFTH OF GERMAN VOTERS THE DAILY MAIL'S WAY OF REPORTING IT IS CRUSHING VERDICT ON OPEN DOOR MIGRATION THE PAPER SAYS THAT IT WAS A DAMNING VERDICT ON ANGELA MERKEL'S
OPEN DOOR BORDER POLICY AND REFERS ON THE INSIDES TOO IN INVERTED COMMAS I SHOULD STRESS HOW NOT NAZIS IN PINSTRIPES HAVE HELPED TO DEFEAT MERKEL TIMES ON ITS FRONT PAGE SHOWS THE SCALE OF BRITAIN'S SCHOOL MATHS CRISIS IS BEING REVEALED AFTER A HIGHLY CRITICAL INTERNATIONAL ANALYSIS LABEL STANDARDS INADEQUATE AND TEACHING SUPERFICIAL LEADING AUTHORITY AND WORLD EDUCATION SENT THE MATHS CURRICULA IN BRITAIN WAS A MILE WIDE AND AN INCH DEEP IT LEFT PUPILS WITH ANY A SHALLOW GRASS
OF THE SUBJECT THIS COMES FROM THE ORGANISATION FOR THE ECONOMIC FOR ECONOMIC CO OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT THERE WE SEE HAD ECHOES THE TIME SAYS COMPLAINTS BY BUSINESS LEADERS AT SOME SCHOOL LEAVERS EVEN GRADUATES LACK ACCEPTABLE
DEGREE OF NUMERACY IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX IS THERE LIFE ON MARS IT'S QUESTION WE ASKED A WEEK GO MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S QUESTION SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SOME TIME AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE IT SEEMS GETTING QUITE CLOSE NOW TO FINDING OUT THE TRUTH
AND THIS IS A ROCKET THAT IS AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS ABOUT TO TAKE OFF HIS JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN EUROPEANS AND THE RUSSIANS JONATHAN AMOS IS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT IN DARMSTADT WHERE THE EUROPEAN SIDE OF IT IS ALL BEING ORGANISED AND ODO HOW QUICKLY JONATHAN WILL THIS MISSION TO MARS TELL US THINGS THAT ARE NEW AND INTERESTING
WELL WITHIN A FEW YEARS I WOULD SAY JUST A NOTHING IS EVER QUICK IN SCIENCE IT'S METHODICAL AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TODAY IS A SATELLITE THAT'S GOING TO LIFT OFF ON A PROTON ROCKET TAKES SEVEN MONTHS TO GET TO THE RED PLANET THEN GOTTA MOVE MANOEUVRE ITSELF INTO WHAT INTO ORBIT AROUND THE PLANET AND THEN IT'LL START STUDYING THE ATMOSPHERE LOOKING AT NEATH THINGS VERY INTERESTING AT MARS BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T REALLY BE THERE
ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT FROM THE SUN SHOULD BREAK IT DOWN PRETTY RAPIDLY SHOULD DISAPPEAR IN A FEW HUNDRED YEARS BUT THE FACT THAT IT PERSISTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE SUGGEST OR SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF THE METHANE THAT'S WHAT THE SATELLITE IS GOING TO TRY AND DETERMINE AND EVENTUALLY BY DRILLING AS WELL
THAT'S A MISSION THAT'S COMING LATER THAT'S THE BIG BRITISH ELEMENT TO THIS JOINT RUSSIAN EUROPEAN PROJECT THERE'S A ROVER THAT'S GOING TO BE MADE IN BRITAIN AND THAT'S GOING TO BE SENT TO DRILL INTO THE SURFACE WHERE DOES THE METHANE COME FROM IT COULD COME FROM GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES WE THINK OF THE PLANET IS BEING LONG DEAD BUT MAYBE SOMETHING IS STILL GOING ON UNDER THE SURFACE THE LOOK AT THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH AND MOST OF THE METHANE COMES FROM MICROBES
YOU KNOW IN THE STOMACHS OF RUMINANTS THERE ARE NO COWS ON MARK WE'VE SPOTTED ANY OF THOSE BUT THERE MUST PIN MY PROBES UNDER THE SURFACE THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO DRILL TWO AND THE BRITISH ROVER IF IT GOES IN TWO OR FOUR YEARS' TIME THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IT'S GOT A DRILL INTO THE SURFACE AND SEE IF THERE ARE SOME MICROBES DOWN THEY'RE USING ITS INSTRUMENTATION AND YOU MENTIONED JOHN THERE THE BRITISH ELEMENT OF THIS WHICH IS IMPORTANT ISN'T IT
YES SO THEY DO YOU KAY HAS PUT A HUGE AMOUNT INTO THIS PROJECT THE SATELLITE THAT'S GOING TODAY WAS WAS MADE IN FRANCE IT ALSO PUT A MODULE ON THE SURFACE AS WELL BUILT IN ITALY THAT WILL TEST THE TECHNOLOGY'S NEEDED TO GET THE ROVER DOWN SAFELY WHEN IT GOES BUT THE U.K. PART OF THIS PROJECT YES HEAVILY INVESTED IN THIS ROVER AND SO YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT TODAY AND OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
SO THAT THERE'S A CLEAR PATH AFORE THAT ROVER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY IF THAT'S WHEN IT LAUNCHES WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY FOUND A COW WOULDN'T IT JONATHAN EMMA THANKS WE WANT DAVID BOOT YOU BACK TOWARDS COMPOSED ABOUT AND THAT IS THIRTY MINUTES PUT A SIX
GUNFIRE BLOODSHED HORROR ONCE AGAIN THAT WAS THE SCENE AT ONCE PEACEFUL AFRICAN BEACH RESORT YESTERDAY TWENTY TWO PEOPLE DIED IN A SHOOT OUT WITH TERRORISTS ON GRAND BASSAM BEACH ON THE IVORY COAST TAMSIN FORD AS A CORRESPONDENT IN ABID TO JAN WELCOME TO YOU TAMSIN YOU'VE BEEN SPEAKING I THINK TO EYE WITNESSES WHO HAVE SEEN THIS HORRIFIC ATTACK
YES EXACTLY AS YOU SAID IT HAPPENED ON THE BEACH WHERE PEOPLE WERE IN THEIR SWIMWEAR I'VE WORRYING'S AND FOREIGN NATIONALS GRANDER SAM IS A SMALL TOWN FORTY KILOMETRES AT THE ECONOMIC CAPITAL ABBEY JOHN WHERE I AM NOW AND IT'S WHERE PEOPLE GO TO AT THE WEEKEND TO ENJOY
NICE FOOD AND TO GO TO THE BEACH IT'S UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE THE CULTURAL CAPITAL OF IVORY COAST AND I SPOKE TO ONE BELGIAN FAMILY WHO WHO WERE THERE WITH THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS
THE THREE YEAR OLD WAS SITTING HAVING LUNCH WITH NO CLOTHES ON THE BABY WAS IN A NAPPY OR BOTH PARENTS WERE IN THEIR SWIMMING COSTUMES AND THEY HEARD GUNFIRE ON THE BEACH AND THEN THEY SAW PEOPLE RUNNING THEY REALISED IT WAS A CELEBRATION OF A PARTY WHICH IS WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS HER FIRST AND SO THEY STARTED RUNNING IN THE MELEE THEY GOT SPLIT UP FROM EACH OTHER AND THEIR MOTHER HID IN A HOTEL WITH A BABY FOR TWO HOURS
DESCRIBE TO ME HOW SHE JUST PRAYED THAT THE BABY WOULDN'T CRY BECAUSE SHE HEARD THE TERRORISTS
OUTSIDE THE SMALL WINDOW OF HERB OF THE TOILET THAT SHE WAS IN ROOTING THROUGH THE ROOMS IN THE HOTEL ROOM AND SHE WAS PETRIFIED THEY WERE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO SHOOT WE KNOW THAT AIR SIXTEEN PEOPLE WERE SHOT DEAD FOURTEEN OF THEM CIVILIANS TO FROM THE IVORIAN SECURITY FORCES
THIS IS A SIMILAR ATTACK IN THIS REGION SINCE NOVEMBER YOU MAY REMEMBER AN ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL BECAME BEGINNER FASO MAGAZINE GAVE A VERY SIMILAR TACK TARGETING FOREIGN NATIONALS AND ALSO IN BAMAKO IN MALI
AND IVORY COAST WAS AWARE THAT THEY COULD BE A TARGET
THE FRENCH EMBASSY HAD WARNED ITS CITIZENS TO BE VIGILANT BUT NOBODY IMAGINED IT WOULD HAPPEN AT BEACH HOTELS IN THE SMALL DUSTY TOWN OUTSIDE OF ABIDJAN
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN HERE WHERE YOU'VE GOT A VIBRANT SHOPPING MALLS AND CINEMA WAS IVORY COAST OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST COCOA EXPORTER IN THE WORLD SO YOU HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF PRIVATE COMPANIES HERE WHERE FOREIGN NATIONALS DO WORK SO THIS REALLY WAS A SHOCK THAT IT HAPPENED
DID PEOPLE SO DEFENCELESS LYING ON THE BEACH ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON CHOCKING TO HEAR THOSE GLORIOUS PEACEFUL SOUNDS OF DAWN BREAKING IN THE IVORY COAST SHOCKING IN COMPARISON WITH THE SCENES THAT WE SAW AND HEARD YESTERDAY TANNERS IN FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
SIXTY MINUTES PAST LET US TURN ON BUDGET WEEK TO ECONOMIC MATTERS MATTHEW IS HERE WITH THE BUSINESS NEWS AND I SUPPOSE THE STATE OF PUBLIC FINANCES TOP OF THE AGENDA FOR ENOUGH ABSOLUTELY JUSTIN WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON THE CHANCELLOR APPEARS TO BE INCREASING THE ECONOMY'S GROWING MORE SLOWLY THAN HAD BEEN THOUGHT
THE TREASURY IS GETTING LESS INCOME FROM TAXES THERE'S BEEN A SMALL OVERSPEND ON INVESTMENT ACCORDING TO ONE ECONOMIC FORECASTING GROUP WILL SPEAK TO IN A MOMENT AND WE ARE SELLING EVEN LESS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAN WE'RE BUYING HIM THAT'S THE WIDENING TRADE DEFICIT YOU HEAR US TALK ABOUT ONE WAY TO IMPROVE THE BIG PICTURE MIGHT BE TO EXPORT MORE THAN WE DO BUT ACCORDING TO THE BUSINESS LEADERS THAT I MET RECENTLY WE'VE GOT SOMETHING OF A PROBLEM THERE
IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO BE CONVINCED OF BRITISH AND AND AT LEAST ONE
BUSINESS SECTOR YOU FIND IT HERE CANARY WHARF TUBE STATION WITH ITS THREE FLOORS OF ROLLING ESCALATORS AND UP AT THE TOP
STEPPING INTO A MODERN LEAVING FINANCIAL CITY THAT FEEL
MANHATTAN IN LONDON TO BE HONEST THE HEARTLAND OF FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY
GREAT BRITISH EXPORT AND WHERE I'M ABOUT TO WALK INTO THE OFFICES OF H. S. B.
MEET UP WITH BRITISH ENTREPRENEURS WHO BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE ENERGISING OUR EXPORTS MORE THAN WE CURRENTLY DO
LIKE POPPING AS YOU GO UP FORTY FIRST FLOOR
I COME O.K. AS I DO IT SO WE STARTED OFF IN THE U.K. NATURALLY
BUT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ENDED UP OVER A CUP OF TEA AGREEING A DEAL TO SUPPLY TO THE ENTIRE HEEM MARKET WHICH WAS CRAZY IT'S AS LUCRATIVE AS WELL OH YEAH IT WAS A VERY GOOD SIX BUT YOU'RE PRETTY HAPPY WITH THAT THAT'S HELEN SEE HAVE SWEET MANDARIN WHICH STARTED AS A RESTAURANT IN MANCHESTER BUT NOW ALSO MAKE SAUCES EXPORTED AROUND THE WORLD
IT SOUNDS TERRIBLY BRITISH THE WAY IN WHICH THIS HAPPENED THE REASON I SAY THAT IS A LOT OF COMPANIES SEEM TO STRUGGLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES OVERSEAS TO EXPORT WHAT WHAT SORT OF
HURDLES DID YOU FACE BEFORE YOU GOT TO THIS POINT AND I WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES I WAS JUST TRYING TO GO TO SAINSBURY'S
SO IS THAT WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK THAT MANY OF OUR EXCELLENT ENTREPRENEURS SIMPLY DON'T THINK ABOUT EXPORTING I'M JUST GOING TO WANDER OVER TO THE FOUNDER OF COBRA VARIOUS NOW BREWED IN BURTON ON TRENT LORD BILLY MAURIER QUESTION HAS AMAZING CAPABILITIES THAT I THINK ARE UNDERAPPRECIATED ROUND
IT MUST BE OUR FAULT SURELY HERE IN BRITAIN THAT WE AREN'T SO WELL KNOWN ROUND THE WORLD TO THE AMERICANS MAKE A GREAT SONG AND DANCE ABOUT THEIR INDUSTRIES AND THEIR INNOVATIONS THE GERMANS ARE KNOWN AROUND THE WORLD FOR GERMAN MANUFACTURING I ALWAYS SAID THAT WE DO NOT SHOUT FROM THE ROOFTOPS ENOUGH AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT I THINK IT IS
ON THE WHOLE THE COUNTRY ON THE WHOLE NEEDS TO NOW GET WE SHOULD BE MORE CONFIDENT OF OUR CAPABILITY IS THE THING ABOUT ABOUT BRITAIN IS THAT YOU NEED TO BE AMBITIOUS AND HUMBLE AND YOU CAN BECOME BISHOPS
BUT THERE'S A LIMIT TO IT I THINK HERE WE NEED TO BE CONFIDENT NOT ARROGANT
THE MORE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THESE WONDERFUL CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO SAY THAT MADE IN BRITAIN DOESN'T SELL ANY MORE THE O.S. STACKS FOR LAST YEAR SHOW THAT WE EXPORT MORE SERVICES THAN WE IMPORT BUT A TRADE DEFICIT GREW SLIGHTLY TO THIRTY FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE WE IMPORTED FAR MORE GOODS THAN WE EXPORT IT I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY FOR SQUIRTER ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THIS COUNTRY
THAT THIS COUNTRY OF SEVENTY MILLION COUNTRY SEVEN BILLION WORLD ITS ECONOMIC FUTURE IS IN EVER TO BE TIE THAT WITH MORE EXPORTS THAT THIS COUNTRY MAKES MAX STEIN BERG IS A MAN WANTING TO CHANGE THAT HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL FOR BUSINESS WHICH ALONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DOUBLE U.K. EXPORTS TO ONE TRILLION POUNDS WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
I THINK WE'RE COMING TO REALISE THAT WE HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH OUR SCHOOLS THROUGH ART COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE TO YOUNG PEOPLE THE TALENT NOT ONLY TO INNOVATIVE CREATE BUT THE TALENT TO EXPORT AND THAT'S A TALENT OF OUR CONFIDENCE IT'S ABOUT KNOWLEDGE I DO THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT FROM MY PURSE OF ONTO YOU ABOUT USE YOUR EDUCATION SYSTEM MORE IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU CAN'T TRAIN ENTREPRENEURSHIP BEACON TRAINED YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THE THE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR EXPORT TO HOW THEY ACTUALLY GO THROUGH A JOURNEY
THAT'S SMACKS STEINBERG WHO'S HEADING THE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL FOR BUSINESS IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE RUNNING RUNNING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT INCLUDES THE REFERENDUM ON THERE
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I SAID TO HIM WOULD IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE HE SAID WELL WHICHEVER WAY WE GO WE'RE GOING TO BE A TRADING NATION BEFORE AND AFTER THAT REFERENDUM LET'S BRING IN FROM GLASGOW LAURA LAMBIE WHO'S THE SENIOR INVESTMENT DIRECTORATE INVEST TECH WEALTH AND INVESTMENT LAURA GOOD MORNING MORNING IS THE TRADE DEFICIT OR PROBLEM
FROM FROM THE MARKET'S POINT OF VIEW I THINK THEY'VE FOCUSED MORE ON AND THE SUCCESS OF THE EXPORTING OF OUR SERVICES FOR A LONG TIME NOW GOODS HAVE BEEN IN DECLINE IN TERMS OF EXPORTING AND AS YOU STARTED THERE THE PIECE THAT WE HEARD IN THE CITY OF LONDON
THAT'S REALLY BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS STORY IN TERMS OF THE YUKI PERHAPS NOT JUST THROUGH THE ENDEAVOURS OF OF THE CITY OF LONDON BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO A VERY GOOD AIR SPACE IN TERMS OF TIME YOU KNOW WITH THE LONDON MARKET IS OPEN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE FAR EASTERN MARKETS SIR PERHAPS WE CAN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT BUT THAT'S REALLY DRIVEN
THAT THE SAIT PLUS AND SERVICES OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO AND WHY IS THAT I MEAN FOR YOUR INVESTORS PRESUMABLY THEN THEY FIND INVESTING IN SERVICE INDUSTRY IN BRITAIN MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN INVESTING IN THEIR IN THEIR GOODS MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TUBE AND IN TERMS OF OF THE ECONOMY IN TERMS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPACT THAT THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM IS HAVING A BUSINESS SENTIMENT IN TERMS OF
IN TERMS OF SHORT TERM BEING ABLE TO MAKE A OR PERHAPS HOLDING BACK WITH MAKING DECISIONS IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN PEOPLE ARE INVESTING IN THEIR BUSINESSES SO I THINK THAT DOES HAVE A SHORT TERM AIR PRESSURE AND BUSINESSES AND THAT WILL REFLECT ITSELF IN IN IN INVESTMENT CHOICES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO O.K. WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET COMING UP ON WEDNESDAY LOTS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO CRUNCH THE ECONOMIC FIGURES TO TRY AND ANTICIPATE WHAT ROOM THE CHANCELLOR HAS AMONG THEM IS MARTIN BECK SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE Y. Y. ITEM CLUB
GOOD MORNING MORNING YOU USED THEIR TREASURIES OWN MODEL FOR THE ECONOMY SO EXACTLY WHAT THE CHANCELLOR HIMSELF IS LOOKING AT THIS MORNING BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT YOU FOUND IS THE TRADE GAP A PROBLEM FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I DON'T THINK IT IS I MEAN HE SAID AS YOU SAID IT'S WIDENED A BIT RECENTLY BUT THERE'S A SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME AS A SHARE G.D.P. IT'S STILL PRETTY SMALL AND YOU COULD ALMOST ARGUE THE TRADE DEFICIT AS A SIGN OF THE ECONOMY'S RELATIVE SUCCESS DOMESTIC DEMAND STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING STRONG AS AS A RESULT
BUY MORE IMPORTS AND A BE REFLECTIVE OR A BIGGER TRADE DEFICIT AND CERTAINLY THE CHANCELLOR TALKED UP BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS WITH THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY OF ANY IN THE G. SEVEN BUT IN YOUR REPORT CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS YOU PREDICT THAT GEORGE OSBORNE'S GOING TO BE BORROWING FOUR BILLION POUNDS MORE THAN HE SAID HE WOULD WHAT'S GONE WRONG I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS AT WORK ME WE'VE SEEN
GROWTH SLOW DOWN RECENTLY WE'VE ALSO SEEN SHARE PRICES FALL AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT MARKET TIMELESS THAT'S BAD FOR CAPITAL GAINS TAX WAGERS GROWTH HAS BEEN WEAK WHICH IS BAD NEWS FOR FOR INCOME TAX REVENUES AND ALSO THE FALL IN THE OIL PRICE MEANS WE'RE GETTING LESS RECEIPTS IN THE NORTH SEA SECTOR SO OVERALL TAX RECEIPTS I'M GOING TO BE GROWING STRONGLY AS THE CHANCELLOR EXPECTED AND YOUR CONCLUSION IS WHAT THAT AUSTERITY PAEDS TO END WELL BECAUSE ECONOMY AS WE CAN
BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE STILL ON THE FLOOR AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY WERE FURTHER INTEREST RATE CUTS IT IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE ECONOMICALLY AT THIS POINT TO BE CUTTING PUBLIC SPENDING FERVOUR AND INTENSIFYING AUSTERITY IF I THINK THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ARGUE THAT THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD INDEED EVEN RELAX A BIT
WE'RE BACK TO CANES WE ARE IN A WAY BUT WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MORE GOVERNMENT BORROWING MORE GOVERNMENT SPENDING TAX CUTS LIKELY BABY A GOOD THING FOR THE ECONOMY LAURA IN GLASGOW THE CHANCELLOR'S ARGUMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT
CUTTING PUBLIC SPENDING CUTTING BORROWING IS THE WAY TO BUY CREDIBILITY GLOBALLY WITH INVESTORS AND THE LIKE AND BEARING IN MIND THE DISCUSSION WE'VE JUST HAD IN TERMS OF SPENDING MORE AND THE END OF AUSTERITY DOING TO INVESTORS STILL BY THE CHANCELLOR'S ARGUMENT OR ARE THEY VEERING TOWARDS THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY MARK CARNEY AMONGST OTHERS THAT THAT ACTUALLY GOVERNMENTS HAVE GOT TO START SPENDING
I THINK THERE'S A FINE BALANCE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT THE FACT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP A BUDGET A BUDGET IN CHICK SITS WELL WITH THE CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY SO AND IF WE ARE IF THE GOVERNMENT IS BORROWING MONEY AND THEY'RE DOING SORT OF REALLY CHEAP MEAT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU DON'T WANT TO STIFLE THE RECOVERY THAT WE HAVE YOUR TWO PER CENT ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT BE THAT THE BEST GROWING ECONOMY IN THE G.SEVEN I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO SHOUT ABOUT REALLY IF YOU COMPARE THAT WITH SOME OF THE GROWTH WE LOOK OVERSEAS TO THE U.S. AND CHINA
I REALLY WANT TO BE PUSHING THE GROWTH RATE EM HIGHER THAN THAT IT IS A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE TWO BUT I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY AN ARGUMENT FOR HER FOR FOR PUSHING SPENDING A BIT WE AND HAVING LESS AND THE ACIDITY FRONT AND AND IS THAT AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU THINK
THE MARKETS WILL START TO BUY INTO IN A BIG WAY AND THEREFORE START TURNING THE THEY'RE THE SORT OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE AND THE OTHER WAY UP OLLIE WILL HE START TO GET MORE PRESSURE FROM THE MARKETS TO SPEND MORE
I I CAN'T SEE THAT HAPPENING TO BE HONEST I SUSPECT HE'S GOING TO GET MORE PRESSURE FOR THE MARKETS TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE MISTAKE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS WITH LLOYDS AND WITH THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HE ANNOUNCES AND WEDNESDAY WITH THAT MARTIN MANY ECONOMISTS I SPEAK TO SO THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD BE BORROWING AT THESE HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES IS IS IS THIS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY WELL UP AT THE MOMENT THE GOVERNMENT CAN BORROWED AN INTEREST RATE WHICH THERE'S ANOTHER BIT HASN'T BEEN LAUREN AT LEAST EIGHTY YEARS SO THIS IS
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY BORROW MONEY SPEND IT ON THINGS LIKE INVESTMENT WHICH COULD GENERATE A DECENT ECONOMIC WOODLAND AND GET GROWTH
COMING UP RATHER THAN DOING THE OPPOSITE AND POTENTIALLY DRAGGING GO FURTHER BY PURSUING FURTHER AUSTERITY AND LAURA MORE GENERALLY ON INVESTORS PLEASE BRING SOME CLARITY TO THIS STOCKS AND SHARES GOING UP GLOBALLY BY THE END OF LAST WEEK OIL ABOVE FORTY DOLLARS A BARREL STILL THERE NICK EH IN JAPAN THIS MORNING IS RISING EVERYTHING SEEMS CALMER THAN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHAT'S GOING ON OH YES HE'S BEEN A MARKED CHANGE SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR WHEN INVESTOR SENTIMENT NEARLY TURNED FAIRLY NEGATIVE
THAT HAS THAT HAS PICKED UP CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND A LOT OF IT ON THE BACK OF THE STIMULUS MEASURES ANNOUNCED BY THE E.C. B. UNIT OR IN REGARD TO HER TO EUROPE
ALL EYES THIS WEEK I THINK WILL BE ON THE POLICY DECISIONS WERE GETTING FROM THE FADED BANK OF JAPAN AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND SO LET'S HOPE THIS POSITIVE INVESTOR SENTIMENT CONTINUES MARTIN LAURA THANKS VERY MUCH JUST A QUICK ONE AT SEVEN FIFTEEN WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE CRISIS IN HOME OWNERSHIP NICK BUT NOW APPARENTLY THERE IS A CRISIS BREWING IN THE RENTAL SECTOR AS WELL MORE ON THAT

SHERIFF INITIALLY IS FROM THE B.B.C.'S TURKISH SERVICE HAS BEEN MONITORING WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IS WHEN THEY COME ON TUTE CHAP I AM I SUPPOSE THE FIRST THING THAT THE QUESTION OF WHO DID IT IS COMPLICATED ISN'T IT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO THINK THAT IT WAS A KURDISH GROUP FOR THEN THEY HAVE REASONS TO WANT TO THINK
WELL OF COURSE BECAUSE THE KADDISH GROUP RATHER THE CARES HAD BEEN FIGHTING AN INSURGENCY A GROUP HAS BEEN FIGHTING INSURGENCY IN TURKEY FOR A WHILE NOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME TURKEY IF WE LOOK AT A NEW SPORT SINCE EVEN IN TURKEY IS MENTIONED IN SEVERAL STORIES OVER SON TURKEYS FINDING HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF
A VERY VERY VOLATILE REGION VOLATILE SITUATIONS FACING MULTIPLE SECURITY ISSUES FOR ONE THING
THE ATTACK IN ANKARA IN LAST OCTOBER IT WAS A BIT OF THERE IS STILL NO CONCRETE ANNOUNCEMENT OR STATEMENT AS TO WHICH GROUP OF RESPONSIBLE AND BLAME DOES GO AROUND AS IN AS IN SEVERAL GROUPS ARE BLAMED AND IT BUT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS FROM BOTH MEMBERS ARE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND FROM KURDISH GROUPS BUT BOTH FAVOUR SAY BOTH HAVE COMMITTED ATROCITIES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
TURKEY AND TURKISH CITIZENS WHO REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH EITHER GROUP ARE FINDING THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONFLICT THAT'S BUILDING IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT THAT ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE TEND TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE POLITICS OF IT AND WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE PULSES OF IT WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY HUGELY IMPORTANT BUT FOR ORDINARY TURKISH PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN THE CAPITAL ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY THIS IS A DESPERATE SITUATION AND OF COURSE HAVING I THINK
PERHAPS OUR LISTENERS SO SOMETIMES THINK THAT AS AS JENISA REPORTERS WE JUST REPORT THE FACTS AND IT DOESN'T HIT HOME BUT I SHALL I CAN SAY THAT I'M FROM ANKARA ACTION MY CHILDHOOD HOME ISN'T A STILLS OF THE ATTACK BECAUSE I LIVED A STREET AWAY FROM WENT AS HAPPENED SO I SPENT MY SHIFT YESTERDAY AND TODAY THEY'RE CALLING EACH FRIEND AND FAMILY MEMBER ONE BY ONE AND IT'S GETTING DIFFICULT TEW
IT'S GETTING HARDER TO DEAL WAS WONDERING IF YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO COME HOME ALIVE THAT EVENING AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COUNTRY THAT HAS FOR THE MOST PART BEEN SEEN AS TIS ISLAND OF STABILITY IN IN A VERY VOLATILE MIDDLE EAST AND I THINK THAT'S THE FEAR AS SO I CAN DEFINITELY RELATE TO DIE FEARED A TURKISH CITIZENS HAVE
ARE THEY GOING TO BE O.K. WHEN THEY STEP OUTSIDE THEIR HOME THE NEXT DAY AND AND WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT AGAIN THIS IS NOT INDEED THE IDEOLOGICAL AND BASIS FOR
THESE ATTACKS ARE THINGS THAT'S REGULAR SUSAN'S DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SHAH FIRSTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SAVAGELY FROM B.B.C.'S TURKISH SERVICE AND AS I SAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING TURKEY WERE REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS NOW BECOMING A DANGEROUSLY UNSTABLE COUNTRY TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN BORIS JOHNSON MAY NOT BE PRIME MINISTER
JUST YET BUT HE HAS USED A COLUMN IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH FOR HER LOVE ACTUALLY MOMENT A PUBLIC DISPLAY OF DEFIANCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF WHAT'S SAID TO BE A PLANNED VISIT TO LONDON BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO TELL BRITISH VOTERS THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR HE'S ENJOYING HIMSELF HERE ISN'T IT
WELL IT'S IT'S INTERESTING NICK BECAUSE BORIS JOHNSON ACCUSES PRESIDENT OBAMA OF QUOTES HYPOCRISY FOR TELLING BRITAIN WHAT IT SHOULD DO WHEN IN BORIS JOHNSON'S ANALYSIS AMERICA HAS CONSPICUOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SORT OF INSTITUTION LIKE THE EUROPEAN UNION TELLING IT WHAT TO DO HE SCIENCE FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT
AMERICA IS NOT PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT HE POINTS TO THE NORTH AMERICA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND SAYS COULD YOU ENVISAGE A SITUATION WHERE THAT DEAL WITH MEXICO AND CANADA WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY A COURT IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THE COMMISSION AND HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT AMERICA HAS BEEN THE MOST VIGOROUS IN DEFENDING ITS SOUTHERN TEA AT THE POINT OF A MUSKET TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THEY BOOTED US
WHY SHOULD THEY TELL US TO SURRENDER OUR SOVEREIGNTY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE TWO SORT OF WRINKLES IN HIS ARGUMENT ONE IS THE BRICKS ARE TEARS DO SEEM TO ME TO BE STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH MAJOR WORLD LEADERS WHO WERE ON THEIR SIDE BEYOND PRESIDENT PUTIN AND ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VIEWS ARE NOT NEW THE FACT IS MOST INTERNATIONAL LEADERS APPEAR TO BE URGING BRITAIN TO REMAIN THE OTHER THING WHICH STRIKES ME AS AWKWARD FOR HIM IS MANY OF THE BRICKS ARE TEARS A LOOK TOO
CLOSER TIES WITH AMERICA THEY ARE ATLANTA SIS AND YET VERY CLEARLY THE POLITICAL CONSENSUS IN AMERICA SEEMS TO BE THEY WOULD LIKE US TO REMAIN PART OF THE E.U. TO PROTECT OUR INFLUENCE WITHIN THE E. USE AND A FUNNY SORT OF WAY THE BRACTS AT HIS FIND THEMSELVES IN THE AWKWARD SITUATION OF WANTING TO FOSTER CLOSER TIES WITH AMERICA AND YET AMERICA SAYING NO NO NO YOU REALLY NEED TO STAY IN THE E.U.
YES I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL MAKE OF THE LANGUAGE FALLACIOUS OUTRAGEOUS EXORBITANT HYPOCRISY BUT BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT I OUGHT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE A WORD OR TWO ABOUT THE BUDGET COS IT IS ONE WEEK IN WHICH WE MAY BE FOCUSING NOT ON THE Y. YOU BIT ON THE CHANCELLOR'S ARITHMETIC AND A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS THAT HE'S MANAGED TO GET OUT BEFORE THE GLOOM OF WEDNESDAY WE LEARN TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO OFFER TOP UPS FOR POORER FAMILIES WHO SAVE MONEY SO
IF YOU ARE ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT ALL WORKING TAX CREDITS AND YOU SAVE UP TO FIFTY POUNDS A MONTH FOR TWO YEARS
PILE OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THE GOVERNMENT GIVE YOU FIFTY PER CENT CASH TOP UP IN OTHER WORDS SIX HUNDRED QUID ON TOP OF THAT FREE IF YOU SAY FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS THEY WILL DO EXACTLY THE SAME AGAIN AND IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MORE VOTER FRIENDLY NEWS AHEAD OF WHAT COULD BE
IF THE CHANCELLOR'S WORDS YESTERDAY ARE ANYTHING TO GO BY A FAIRLY DIFFICULT BUDGET WITH WE KNOW THE CHANCELLOR PENCILLING IN YET MORE SAVINGS HE APPEARS TO BE TARGETING GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AGAIN NON PROTECTED GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS THE SCALE OF THE SAVINGS FROM RANGE FROM ESTIMATES OF AROUND FOUR BILLION TO
UP TO FIFTY BILLION IN SOME REPORTS TODAY AND MY GUESS IS THERE WILL BE THE DEPARTMENTAL SAVINGS AND HIS OTHER WEAPON OF CHOICE AND IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT STEALTH TAXES WHERE WE SAW TAXES OBVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE PREMIUM STAMP DUTY APPRENTICESHIP LEVY SOCIAL CALEB WE MAY SEE MORE OF THAT IN AN EFFORT TO BALANCE THE BOOKS NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME HE'S TWENTY TO SEVEN MAN IT IS NOT IT SEEMS DOOMED TO BE DEFEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN BY MACHINE
NOT YET ANYWAY IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN A HUMAN PLAYER OF THAT ANCIENT EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX GAME GO AND THE ALPHA GO COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT CAN LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES THAN MERE MORTAL HAS JUST WON A GAME HAVING LOST THREE IN A ROW AMEN INSOLE STEVE EVANS CAN TELL US MORE I IMAGINE THERE'S SOME RELIEF AMONGST THE HUMAN CONTINGENT THERE STEVE

FIRSTLY THAT ALPHA GO SO MANY IN A ROW AND THEN THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER AND THEN LISE SAY DOLL CAME BACK WITH ONE SO THEY'RE SHAKEN CAN I TALK TO THE EUROPEAN CHAMPION A MOMENT AGO WHO LOST COMPREHENSIVELY TO A HALF AGO AND HE SAID THAT HE WAS DEEPLY HIS PSYCHE WAS SHAKEN BY IT AND HIS CONFIDENCE HE THOUGHT HAD BEEN WRECKED BY BEING DEFEATED BY A MACHINE THOUGH HE THEN REALISED
THAT HIS ABILITY TO PLAY HAD IMPROVED EAT YOU SAY THEY SEE IT AS A AS A BATTLE WITH THE AMERICAN GIANT GOOGLE BUT HE'S A LAD FROM NORTH LONDON ISN'T IT IS A GUY STARTED PROGRAMMING WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN WHO IS INTO GAMES AND IS NOW TRYING TO HELP THE N.H.S.

LITTLE BIT LATER ON I KNOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE PAPERS BORIS JOHNSON TELLING THE TELEGRAPH AT ANY INTERVENTION BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WOULD BE A PIECE OF OUTRAGEOUS AND EXORBITANT HYPOCRISY WAS REPORTED AT THE WEEKEND THAT U.S. PRESIDENT WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO BACK THE N. CAMPAIGN DURING A VISIT TO BRITAIN NEXT MONTH WRITING FOR THE PAPER THE MAYOR OF LONDON ARGUES THE E.U. IS A SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD REJECT OUT OF HAND
THE GUARDIAN REPORTS OF MISTER JOHNSON'S LEGACY AS MAYOR HAS BEEN SAVAGED BY ONE OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S CLOSEST ALLIES THE FORMER DOWNING STREET STRATEGIST STEVE HILTON THE BLUE ON BLUE ATTACK IT SAYS HIS EVIDENCE THE REFERENDUM DEBATE IS SET TO BECOME INCREASINGLY BITTER AND PERSONAL AND TIME SAYS THAT THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR WAS GIVEN A BLOODY NOSED BY VOTERS WHO FLOCK TO A NEW ANTI IMMIGRATION PARTY IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS YESTERDAY
IN ITS LEADER COLUMN THE PAPER SAYS THE DEFEAT OF ANGELA MERKEL C.D.U. PARTY IN TWO STATE PARLIAMENTS SENDS AN UNAMBIGUOUS MESSAGE THAT HER DECISION TO OPEN BORDERS TO SYRIAN REFUGEES WAS WRONG THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THE FALL RIGHT HUMILIATED MISSUS MERKEL IT SAYS THE RESULTS WILL PROMPT RENEW CALLS FROM WITHIN THE C.D.U. FOR A CHANGE OF COURSE THE MAIL SAYS THE POLES WILL BE SEEN AS AN INDICTMENT OF THE FAILURE OF EUROPE'S RULING CLASSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PUBLIC'S FEARS ABOUT MIGRATION
LOOKING AHEAD TO BUDGET ON WEDNESDAY THE SUN AND THE DAILY MIRROR AMONG SEVERAL PAPERS TO REPORT THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY IN THE TREASURY NEEDS TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL FOUR BILLION POUNDS OF CUTS GEORGE OSBORNE'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF RUPERT HARRISON TELLS THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS LITTLE POLITICAL COST OF THE CHANCELLOR FROM PENCILLING IN FURTHER SPENDING REDUCTIONS BUT THERE IS MUCH TO BE RISK
FROM TIGHT PARLIAMENTARY VOTES ON HIGHER TAXES ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE FILMING OF THE NEW SERIES OF TOP GEAR WAS JUST TOO TAXING FOR THE CHANCELLOR YESTERDAY HE LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE NOISE OF A FORD MUSTANG BEING DRIVEN NEAR HORSEGUARDS PARADE WAS DISTURBING DISTURBING HIS BUDGET PREPARATIONS BUT EILIDH STAR NOTES THAT SMOKING WHEEL SPINS PERFORMED BY THE PRESENTER MATT THE BALL LEFT TYRE MARKS OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT
THE DAILY EXPRESS IT WAS MISTER OSBORNE IN A SPIN AFTER HE TWEETED HER BLOGS COSTAR CHRIS EVANS TO KEEP IT DOWN PLEASE THE TEAM STUMPED NEAR THE CENOTAPH ANGERED THE FORMER COMMANDER OF U.K. FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN COLONEL RICHARD KEMP REPORTS THE TELEGRAPH HE TOLD THE PAPER IT BEGGARS BELIEF THE PROGRAMME TEAM WAS ALLOWED TO FILM SO CLOSE TO THE MEMORIAL THE B. B. C. TELLS US ON THE FILMING WAS AGREED IN ADVANCE AND THE SCENES WERE SHOT FORTY METRES AWAY FROM THE CELL ITSELF
AND FINALLY SIGNED TO SETTLE SUET POSSIBLE TO LIVE FOREVER THERE IS A CATCH THOUGH ACCORDING TO THE DAILY MAIL WE HAVE TO BECOME A ROBOT IT SAYS RUSSIANS AND JAPANESE TEAMS WELL ARE LOOKING FOR A WAY OF UPLOADING A PERSON'S MEMORIES AND PERSONALITY TO AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM THE SUN REPORTS OF THE RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN DMITRI IS CORFE IS BEHIND ONE OF THE PROJECTS HE'S HOPING A HUMAN BUT NEVER DIES WILL BE CREATED BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND SAYS HE'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENT IT WILL
YOU'RE LISTENING TODAY ON YOU READY FULL WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY HAS PROMISED A RELENTLESS FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AFTER MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY A CAR BOMB IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA THE SYRIAN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS RESTART IN GENEVA TODAY BUT WITH WHAT AFFECT LEASED TO SET IS THAT CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTS SPOKE TO ME A FEW MOMENTS AGO FROM DAMASCUS
THIS COULD BE HOPE FOR HER FIRST OF ALL THAT THE TWO SIDE SHOW UP END THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAPPEN THEY WILL STAY WILL THEY ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER WELL THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT PROXIMITY TALKS THAT IS THAT THEY
THE TRUE DELEGATIONS THE OPPOSITION AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL SIT IN SEPARATE ROOMS AND STUFF I DIMMER STOOD UP WITH THE U.N. ENVOY WILL GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE ROOMS BUT EVEN GETTING TO THAT POINT IS GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS BOTH SIDES HAVE MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE NOT BUDGED
AN INCH ON THE MEAN TO MAN HERE IN DAMASCUS THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASAD IS THE PRESIDENT
THAT'S A RED LINE WE ARE NOT DISCUSSING NOT EVEN ELECTIONS WHICH ARE ON THE AGENDA AS PART OF THE U.N. BACKED PROGRAMME FOR THE OPPOSITION THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY'RE IN GENEVA
IS TO BRING AN END TO PRESIDENT ASAD'S RULE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT A COMPROMISE ON THAT RIGHT NOW
AND YOU WERE TELLING US A FEW DAYS AGO LEASE THAT THAT THERE WAS A KIND OF
EERIE CALM IN AT LEAST PARTS OF SYRIA NOW AND PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THESE TALKS AND EFFORTS TO AT LEAST REDUCE THE VIOLENCE HAVE SOME KIND OF A WORKING CEASEFIRE IS IS THAT STILL THE CASE
THERE IS A VERY RARE VERY FRAGILE QUIET HERE BUT BECAUSE IT IS SYRIA A COUNTRY WHICH HAS SURVIVED A DEVASTATING WAR THAT HAS NOW LASTED FIVE YEARS FRONT THIS MONTH
IT'S NOT PERFECT IT IS ONLY PARTIAL THERE ARE STILL VIOLATIONS REPORTED EVERY DAY THERE ARE STILL MAJOR GROUPS INCLUDING THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHICH ARE NOT PART OF IT BUT WHAT THE COM DOES IS IT CREATES A POSSIBILITY
THIS IS WHAT STEREO COULD BE LIKE IF THE WARRING EXCITES COULD FIND A WAY TO SAY LET'S TRY AS HARD DO OR DIE IS TO FINDING A WAY OUT OF THIS WORK AS A MILITARY SOLUTION WILL NOT WORK JUST LOOK AT THE STATISTICS OF THIS WAR A WAR OF OUR TIME
THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION SERIOUS THAT'S HALF OF ITS PRE WAR POPULATION FORCED TO FLEE IT'S HAWK THAT HAUNTS THE NUMBERS ARE NUMBING PEOPLE ARE NUN HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE WHEN YOU HAVE LOST SO MANY FRIENDS SO MANY FAMILIES SUMMONED MANY FAMILY MEMBERS SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU KNEW
ARE YOU LIKE EVERYONE HAS A STORY FOR A RADIO FOUR SERIES WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THE SURVIVORS OF THAT WAR SOME STILL SPEAK OF A REVOLUTION OTHERS CONDEMNED WHAT THEY CALL TERRORISTS IN THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A YOUNG STUDENT IN THE CITY THERE ARE THE CITY WHERE THE UPRISING BEGAN FIVE YEARS AGO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CITY NOW ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS
YEAH FROM THAT TERRORISTS HE WAS WALKING HIS LOOKING SIDE NATURALLY GOING TO HEAR A CITY SOUTHERLY A STRAY BULLET CAME HE WAS THAT
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO HIM I SHOUTED CARRIED HIM CALL AN AMBULANCE ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP WE CAN GET A HOSPITAL TRIED TO TREAT HIM TEN MINUTES LATER
IS THAT WE LOST
I DIDN'T HAVE IT THERE WAS NO REACTION AT ALL EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL REACTION I DIDN'T REACT AT ALL
JUST LIKE THIS WHAT HAPPENED HE WAS JUST WITH ME WE WERE TALKING TO PLANNING FOR TOMORROW PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE AND NOW HE IS DINNER SET IT GOING TO BE UNDER THE GROUND AND THERE ARE MORE VOICES FROM SARAH ELLIS'S DOCUMENTARIES CALLED SARAH INVOICES IT'S ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR AT MIDDAY GATED
ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S A PRIZE THAT GIVES THE CITY THE CHANCE TO SHOW OFF TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BEING CHOSEN TO BE THE U.K.'S CITY OF CULTURE BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IT WAS DERRY LONDONDERRY'S TURN NEXT YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE HOLES BUT WHO HAVE WHICH CITY WILL COME NEXT IN FOUR YEARS' TIME AROUND A HALF DOZEN CITIES ARE HOPING TO BE CHOSEN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NICK HYAM HAS MADE IT HIS MISSION TO VISIT THEM ALL LAST MONTH HE WAS IN PAISLEY TODAY HE'S IN COVENTRY IN THE WEST MIDLANDS
CITY OF COVENTRY
NOVEMBER NINETEEN FORTY AND THE MEDIEVAL CENTRE OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST HISTORIC CITIES IS DESTROYED BY BOMBING THE STEEPLE OF HER ONE TIME YOU WOULD HAVE A PARTY IN CENTURY GOOD
IN THIS BIBLE BETTER
WHAT THE LUFTWAFFE STARTED THE POSTWAR PLANNERS FINISHED COVENTRY CENTRE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY REBUILT AND THE CITY'S REPUTATION NEVER RECOVERED
ANDREW DIXON IS COVENTRY'S CITY OF CULTURE BID ADVISER IT'S A PLACE THAT IS UNDERVALUED UNDERRATED UNLOVED ARE PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD
BUT IT'S A CITY THAT HAS GIVEN A GREAT DEAL TO THE WORLD IT INVENTED THEATRE AND EDUCATION OF FIFTY YEARS AGO WARWICK UNIVERSITY WAS THE FIRST PLACE THAT STUDIED FILM
U.K. AND IT'S A PLACE WHERE ARTISTS HAVE BEEN REINVENTING THE CITY FOR MANY CENTURIES THIS IS WALL PAINTING FROM FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WAS PAINTED TO CELEBRATE THE COMPLETION OF THE MONASTERY AND SOME OF COVENTRY'S HERITAGE DID SURVIVE THE UNHURRIED BEEN SHOWED ME ROUND THE CHARTERHOUSE THE REMAINS OF A MEDIEVAL MONASTERY NOW BEING RESTORED BY A TRUST HE SAYS THE CITY OF CULTURE BIDDERS HELPING TRANSFORM THE WAY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE CITY
IT'S GIVING AN EXTERNAL IMAGE TO INVESTORS TO TOURISTS TO PEOPLE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO THE UNIVERSITY THE COVENTRY IS THIS PLACE OF HERITAGE AS WELL AND THERE ARE SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS TO DO IT'S A NICE PLACE TO LIVE AND IT'S A NICE PLACE TO WORK IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COVENTRY WAS THE CAPITAL OF THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY IT MADE THE PLACE RICH
PEUGEOT DECIDED TO CALL IT A DAY THEY'LL STOP BRITISH CAR PRODUCTION NEXT YEAR THE COMPANY HAS BLAMING HIGH COSTS AT RYTON NEAR COVENTRY WHERE OVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS BUT ONE BY ONE THE CAR FACTORIES CLOSED ONLY JAGUAR LAND ROVER NO REMAINS
THERE ARE EMPTY SHOP FRONTS BEHIND THE BUS CREWS IN THE CITY CENTRE AND PARTS OF THE CITY ARE SERIOUSLY RUN HE'LL FIELDS AS ONE OF ITS POOREST AND MOST DEPRIVED NEIGHBOURHOODS A PLACE OF HIGH CRIME HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND MANY RECENT GIMMICK
BUT JUST ACROSS THE DUAL CARRIAGEWAY FROM VEAL FIELDS IS FAR GOSFORD STREET HERE THE FARGO CREATED VILLAGE IS THE CENTREPIECE OF A WIDER SCHEME TO REGENERATE ONE OF COVENTRY'S FEW REMAINING MEDIEVAL STREETS WITH THE HELP OF TEN MILLION POUNDS IN PUBLIC SECTOR GRANTS AMONG THE CRAFT SHOPS AND MARKET STALLS I FOUND AL DAVISON A GRAPHIC ARTIST
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON HERE A LOT OF ART SORT OF BIG FILM COMMUNITY COMMUNITY BUT AS KIND OF A WELL KEPT SECRET AND I THINK WHY WE NEED TO REALLY MADE THE WHOLE CITY OF CULTURE IS SO THAT THAT BECOMES MORE WELL KNOWN
THE STUDENTS HIPSTERS AND CREATIVE TYPES WHO COME TO FARGO MANY FROM COVENTRY UNIVERSITY AT THE END OF THE STREET ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE CITY OF CULTURE BID
THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT GETS OVERLOOKED YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE AND EVEN SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WAS CREATED IN THE
THE SIXTIES THAT PEOPLE THINK IS ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I LOOK AT THAT IT WAS A COMPLETELY FIFTY AND I THINK WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CELEBRATE
COVENTRY HAS LONG BEEN A MULTICULTURAL CITY IN THE LATE SEVENTIES IT HELPS BORN TO TURN A FUSION OF JAMAICAN SCARRAN BRITISH PUNK THE SELECTOR A LEADING TO TURN BAND CAME FROM COVENTRY NOW THE CITY'S BELGRADE THEATRE'S PUTTING EXTRA EMPHASIS ON WORK BY BLACK AND ASIAN WRITERS AND PERFORMERS IN RESPONSE TO THE CITY OF CULTURE BID
A BLACK YOUTH DRAMA GROUP WARMED UP IN A REHEARSAL ROOM THE THEATRE'S BOZZ HAMISH GLEN RECALLED GLASGOW IN NINETEEN NINETY WHEN IT WAS EUROPEAN CAPITAL OF CULTURE THE GLASGOW EXPERIENCE WAS VERY BIG FOR ME VERY FORMATIVE ABOUT HOW
YOU CAN USE CULTURE TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM A CITY'S REPUTATION ITS ECONOMY IT'S
ARCHITECTURE IN GLASGOW THEY BUILT A CONCERT HALL FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T THINK CAN BE OVERESTIMATED THE IMPACT THAT SUCCESS COULD BRING TO THE CITY
THAT WAS NICK HIGHAM REPORTING THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE FRENCH TEAM INVESTIGATING THAT AWFUL GERMAN WINKLES AIR DISASTER A YEAR AGO MUCH CO PILOT DELIBERATELY KILLED HIMSELF AND ALL ON BOARD HIS PLANE HAD NEVER FRANCE HE'LL REMEMBER HAVE CALLED FOR THE ISSUE OF MEDICAL CONFIDENTIALITY FOR CREW MEMBERS TO BE REASSESSED ANDREUS NEW BITS WAS VERY ILL HE WAS SEVERELY DEPRESSED BUT HIS EMPLOYERS COULD NOT BE TOLD
IN THE COURSE AND IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH AIRLINE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION AND IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST AT THE RULES FOR A PILOT IS THAT THE SAME AS FOR THE GERMAN ONES AND OTHER WORDS EVEN IF YOU WERE SEVERELY DEPRESSED YOUR EMPLOYER COULD NOT BE TOLD BY A DOCTOR NO A KISS AS EXTREME AS LUBITSCH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE GOT BACK TO THE THE AUTHORITIES IN THE U.K. INTO THE AIRLINE SAW THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A YOU KEY ISSUE
WHAT WE NEED MEDIA'S NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL I BEG YOUR PARDON STAND UPS FOR HOLIDAYS OR EVALUATIONS ARE DONE
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT DRIVE THIS PROBLEM ON THE GROUND ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE SUFFER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THE KEY ISSUE IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STEP FORWARD NOT TO STIGMATISE HER NOT TO SAY THAT'S THE END OF YOUR CAREER BUT TO COME FORWARD AND WITH PROPER TREATMENT AND SUPPORT WILL PUT MY ENERGY THROUGH THIS SHE'LL GET BACK INTO A FOOL ACT LIFE AS A LANE PILOT BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT BALANCE RIGHT IS IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS MORNING AND YOU FEEL IN BRITAIN WE DO GET THE BALANCE RIGHT
I THINK WE GET THE BALANCE RIGHT I THINK THAT WAS A SUPPORTER AND A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAN MORSE AIRLINES WE CAN DO BETTER WE'RE TRIALLING NEW PEUT INTONATION PROGRAMMES WHERE INDIVIDUALS
CAN BE SELF OR AFFAIR ALL ODD CAN BE MENTIONED BY THE FAMILY MEMBERS AT US CAN SAY I'M NOT BY FELLOW PILOTS AND THEIR BROUGHT INTO A SYSTEM WHERE THE TAKEN OFF LINE FOR A TIME WELL STILL ASSESSED AND HELPED AND IN BACK ONLINE WHEN THAT'S THE SORT OF ENVIRONMENT WE WANT TO CREATE AN AND OBVIOUSLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AIRLINES
TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO YOU'RE SAYING THE INFORMATION WOULD COME FROM A DOCTOR IN THIS COUNTRY AND SHOULD COME FROM A DOCTOR IN IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN OTHER COUNTRIES BUT THE BIG ISSUE THEN IS WHAT THE AIRLINES DO IT
THAT'S IT AND BUT THIS THIS CASE WAS SO EXTREME IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE WE DO NOT THINK IT WAS PREVENTABLE IN THE KISSER MUYBRIDGE AND INDEED
UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE'S MENTAL STATE IS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH PROFESSOR SIMON WESLEY FROM THE COLLEGE OF PSYCHIATRY AND HIS EXPERIENCES THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT SO THE WHOLE CULTURE OF THE AIRLINE HAS TO BE ONE OF SUPPORT
SUPPORTING NOT STIGMATISING AND INCOMING ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD SO GETTING THAT CULTURE RATES WHAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT JUST THE CULTURE AROUND MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE WE ARE VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING WHAT'S GOING WRONG
WITH ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED AND I THINK THE FRENCH REPORTERS TERRIFIC IT'S VERY BALANCED VERY SENSIBLE IT WILL ADD TO PASSENGER SAFETY WHAT WERE NOT VERY GOOD AT IS PREDICTING WHERE THE NEXT DISASTER IS GOING TO CLEAR FROM DAY JIM OF COURSE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH AIRLINE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION THANKS THANK YOU

THE KURDISH GUERRILLA GROUP WITH WHICH THE STATE HAS BEEN FIGHTING A RENEWED CONFLICT SINCE LAST JULY A P.K.K. OFFSHOOT SAID IT WAS BEHIND LAST MONTH'S CAR BOMB IN ANKARA

D. IT WON SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN ALL THREE STATES THAT VOTED YESTERDAY ITS LEADER SAID MISSUS MERKEL'S CATASTROPHIC POLICIES HAD OPEN PEOPLE'S EYES HERE'S OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT JENNY HILL

A PROPOSED DEAL TO END THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS RUNNING INTO SERIOUS LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES UNDER THE AGREEMENT TURKEY WOULD TAKE BACK ALL ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS WHILE THE E.U. WOULD ACCEPT AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SYRIANS FROM TURKISH CAMPS SPEED UP TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND BRING FORWARD PLANS TO ALLOW TURKS VISA FREE TO TRAVEL
THE DEAL IS DUE TO BE FINALISED AS A SUMMIT LATER THIS WEEK BUT IT FACES CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION AS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS
THE DRAFT DEAL HAS RUN INTO A STORM OF PROTEST FROM THE U.N. AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS WHO DESCRIBED IT AS IMMORAL AND ILLEGAL LAWYERS ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEVISE A PLAN THAT WOULD HELP MEET THE E. USE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS NEW LEGISLATION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO PASS THROUGH BOTH THE GREEK AND TURKISH PARLIAMENT'S RIGHT OF ANYONE SEEKING ASYLUM TO APPEAL AGAINST THEIR RETURN TO TURKEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE GUARANTEED AND EVERY CASE WOULD HAVE TO BE HEARD INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE A TRIBUNAL
THE PROPOSED DEAL ALSO INCLUDES NUMEROUS INCENTIVES FOR TURKEY BUT SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES ARE UNHAPPY THEY CAN BE NO SHORT CUT THEY INSIST TO VISA FREE TRAVEL FOR TURKEY CITIZENS TO THE SHAMAN AREA AND CYPRESSES WARNED THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO BLOCK NEW NEGOTIATIONS ON TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP BID UNLESS TURKEY CHANGED ITS POLICY AND RECOGNISED THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFICULT DIPLOMACY STILL TO BE DONE THIS WEEK

WITH WESTMINSTER GRIPPED BY E.U. REFERENDUM FERVOUR DAVID CAMERON'S FOCUS TODAY IS A REMINDER OF WHAT HE'D LIKE HIS FINAL YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER TO BE REMEMBERED FOR WHAT HE CALLED AN ALL OUT ASSAULT ON POVERTY IN HIS PARTY CONFERENCE SPEECH LAST AUTUMN
OR HELP TO SAVE SCHEME WILL ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE THE VERY LOWEST PAID TO PUT MONEY ASIDE EACH MONTH BY OFFERING A BONUS OF FIFTY PER CENT UP TO A MAXIMUM OF SIX HUNDRED POUNDS OF WHAT THEY'VE SAVED AFTER TWO YEARS
AFTER ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF SAVING THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANOTHER BONUS AGAIN UP TO SIX HUNDRED POUNDS THE MONEY COULD BE SPENT ON ANYTHING THE SAVER WANTED BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THE SCHEME IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS SUGGEST MINISTERS DON'T EXPECT MANY OF THOSE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE

A STABLE DEMOCRACY A BEACON TO ITS NEIGHBOURS IN THE MIDDLE EAST A COUNTRY THAT WILL ONE DAY TAKE ITS PLACE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS HOW THE LEADERS OF TURKEY ONE TO SEE THEIR COUNTRY BUT ONCE AGAIN LAST NIGHT THE WORLD IS SEEING AND HEARING SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT
A CAR BOMB IN ANKARA THE SECOND IN JUST A MONTH HAS KILLED MORE THAN THIRTY IT'S NOT YET CLEAR WHICH OF TURKEY'S MORTAL ENEMIES THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OR KURDISH SEPARATIST ARE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
WHAT DOES IT MEAN NOT JUST FOR THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE E.U. WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY A MEMBER OF THE COMMONS FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. NADINE'S AHA WE WAS IN TURKEY JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IS ALSO ON THE ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP FOR KURDISTAN A MORNING TO YOU MY MORNING IT'S FRIGHTENING EVIDENCE ISN'T IT OF THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN TURKEY
IT IS AND I THINK EVIL VISITED ANKARA YESTERDAY AND OUR CONDOLENCES AND PRAYERS ARE WITH ALL THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AND OF COURSE THE FAMILIES I THINK TARGETING INNOCENT PEOPLE IS ABHORRENT AND CRIMINAL
MADE ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING ON TWO FRONTS ON THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT BEFORE STILL UNCLEAR WHO IS TO BLAME
THAT'S RIGHT I'VE BEEN TURK HE HAS JOINED THE FIGHT AGAINST DAISHA GUEST I SORT OF AND ARE PART OF THE COALITION THEY'RE WORKING VERY VERY WELL WITHIN THAT COALITION WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT CLEARLY
YOUR TURKEY IS HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH TERRORISM AND WE STAND BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEREVER TERRORISM BASIS UGLY HEAD WE GO AFTER IT NOW YOU MAKE CLEAR THAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH PEOPLE THEY'RE INEVITABLY TO THOUGH THERE ARE DEBATES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF TURKEY AND ITS ROLE IN THIS GREAT DEBATE
ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT NOW FINDS ITSELF ON THE FRONT LINE OF THAT INSTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT'S THE FRONT LINE FOR MIGRATION AS WELL FOR THE VICTIMS REALLY OF THAT THOSE TROUBLES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL
WE SAW THE CHANCELLOR ON TELEVISION YESTERDAY SOUND A RATHER MORE AMBIVALENT ABOUT TURKISH MEMBERSHIP OF THE Y. YEAR IN THE FUTURE THAN THE GOVERNMENT HAS IN THE PAST DO YOU THINK THIS NOW WILL BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DEBATE I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO CLARIFY EXPOSITION OF THE TURKEY JOINING THE E.U. IN THE PAST THE GARDEN'S BEEN A CHAMPION OF TURKEY
JOINING THE E.U. THE PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY IS THE BACKDROP TO THIS A REFERENDUM AND THEY'D THE DEAL THAT YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING THIS MORNING TURKEY HAS NEGOTIATED HARD THEY WANT REZA FREE MOVEMENT BY JUNE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE STATEMENT OFFICIAL STATEMENT SAYS
HE'S A FREE MOVING IN ALL MEMBER STATES THAT WE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IMPACT IS BECAUSE THE MINISTER LAST WEEK SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE SHAKEN BUT WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BEYOND THE U.K. IF TURKEYS TO BECOME A FULL MEMBER OF THE E.U. THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING A NATIONAL LIVING WAGE OF
NINE POUNDS TWENTY MANY OF THE CURRENT COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE OF TWO POUNDS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT ON OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY WE'VE COMMITTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THIS DEAL
WITH MORE COMING NEXT WEEK ANOTHER TURNED US FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YOURS ON TOP OF THE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION WERE PUTTING INTO THE CAMPS IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE JORDAN AND A IRAQ AND I'LL SWEAR YOU WERE YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO IS IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION SO YOU BELIEVE THAT TURKEY IF YOU LIKE IS ONE OF THE RISKS OF STAYING IN IS THAT RIGHT WELL THERE ARE MANY RISKS AND I THINK YOU SAW THE RESULTS IN THE GERMAN ELECTIONS YESTERDAY THERE'S A SORT OF THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT IS IS THIS OF THE TWO BIG
TESTS THAT CAME BEFORE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SORT OF THAT THIS BUREAUCRACY THIS UNACCOUNTABLE BROCK'S ONE WAS OBVIOUSLY THE EUROZONE CRISIS WHICH IS CLEARLY HAVING ITS OWN CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS IN THE SECOND IS IMMIGRATION
AND IT IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE IT AFFECTS OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY AT LEAVING YOU DOES NOT OF COURSE INSULATE YOU FROM MIGRATION PROBLEMS OR INSULATE YOU FROM TERRORISM THEY MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BETTER BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THE PROBLEM DOES IT NO BUT IT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL YOUR IMMIGRATION AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE TO TURN AWAY VERY TALENTED SOUTH AFRICANS AUSTRALIANS EVEN AMERICAN STARE I SAY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE FREE MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT EUROPE
THERE IS A MASSIVE PULL FACTOR THAT WILL BE EXASPERATED BY A FANTASTIC POLICY OF A NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THERE ARE RISKS AROUND US STAYING IN AS EUROPE CHANGES THEY'RE MAKING THESE POLICIES SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE ON THE HOOF NADINE'S AHOY THANK YOU JOIN US
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE SHOCKWAVES ARE RIPPLING ACROSS GERMANY ANGLE A MERKEL WHO WAS BEING FETED ACROSS EUROPE ONLY MONTHS AGO AS A POLITICIAN OF STRENGTH AND COURAGE THE PRE EMINENT VOICE IN THE E.U. WELL SHE'S COME DOWN TO EARTH WITH A VERY BIG BUMP A REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN GERMANY OVER THE WEEKEND HAVE SEEN HER C.D.U. PARTY LOSE VERY BADLY TO THE RIGHT WING ANTI IMMIGRATION PARTY ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND COALITION PARTNERS THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY DID EVEN WORSE
THOUGH THE GREENS DID QUITE WELL JENNY HILL AS OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THIS I MEAN THAT THE OVERWHELMING
VIEW THAT JENNY IS THAT SHE LOST BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION AND IT WAS A LOSS THAT WILL HAVE REAL IMPLICATIONS
POTENTIALLY SO I'M IN THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING ARE A FULL OF THIS CERTAINLY WON ONE PAPER COMMENTARY AS SO YOU KNOW HOW SHOWING WAS PORT TO DISASTROUS THE C.D.U. LOST ALL THREE REGIONAL ELECTIONS BUT THE REAL STORY HERE I THINK IS THE RISE OF ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND OR A.F. DE GERMANY'S POPULIST ANTI MIGRANT AND ANTI MERKEL PARTY AT ONE UP TO A QUARTER OF THE VOTE IN ONE OF THESE GERMAN REGIONS THE TABLOID NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING BUILT
DEEMING THIS AND I HOPED FOR DEUTSCHLAND AND NIGHT FOR GERMANY THERE ARE THOSE HERE WHO STAY LOOK MISSUS MERKEL'S POLICY HAS RUN THE TEST AT THE AT THE BALLOT BOX AND IT'S BEEN FOUND WANTING THERE ARE OTHERS THOUGH WHO POINT OUT THAT THIS PROTEST VOTE WAS ALWAYS PRETTY INEVITABLE INTERESTING THIS MORNING THE REACTION TO A.F. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE POINTING OUT THERE MISSUS MERKEL HAS TAKEN HER COALITION GOVERNMENT SO PART OF THE CENTRE HERE IN GERMANY
ACTUALLY F.T. IS NEVER TO BE FILLING THE POLITICAL VACUUM ON THE RIGHT BUT CERTAINLY THIS MORNING MISSUS MERKEL WHEN SHE'S DUE TO MEET SENIOR MEMBERS OF HER CONSERVATIVE PARTY LATER ON AS A PRETTY DIFFICULT DAY AHEAD YOU KNOW GERMANY'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED OVERNIGHT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW IS IS SHE GOING TO ALTER HER COURSE WELL EXACTLY AND THAT'S JUST ON THAT ON THAT ON THAT POINT JENNY NOT ONLY IS SHE GOING TO ALTER COURSE
IN GERMANY BUT ALSO CAN SHE BE THE POWER THAT SHE HAS BEATEN YOU THINK OF THE DEAL THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO WITH TURKEY AT THE MOMENT AT THE E.U. LEVEL CAN SHE STILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH IN EUROPE TO FORCE THAT
THERE ARE THOSE WHO I THINK YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT ACTUALLY INVITING WITHIN HER OWN COALITION GOVERNMENT OVER HER REFUGEE POLICY HAS LEFT A WEEK AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL EUROPEAN STAGE AND THAT'S MADE IT HARDER FOR HER TO NEGOTIATE ANY KIND OF DEAL WITH TURKEY AND INDEED THE REST OF THE E.U. THAT MISSUS MERKEL HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME PUSHING FOR A EUROPEAN SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND THE MAJORITY OF GERMANS ACTUALLY AGREE WITH HER SHE'S FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE THAT ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THE POTENTIAL DEAL WITH TURKEY HAS COME A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE
TO HAVE ANY REAL EFFECT ON THESE REGIONAL ELECTIONS BUT YOU KNOW THE INDICATIONS WE'RE GETTING FROM BERLIN FROM HER GENERAL SECRETARY PAID TO TELL HER THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO ALTER HER COURSE SHE'S GOING TO STICK WITH THIS AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT COULD MEAN FOR HER POLITICAL FUTURE YEAH O.K. THANK YOU LET'S PUT THAT ON THE BLOCK IS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OF THE EUROPEAN PART OF MISSUS MERKEL'S BROCK SO BUILT ASSAYING SAYING NIGHTMARE FOR GERMANY DO YOU AGREE
AND THE SOLUTION IS WHAT IN YOUR VIEW
OH SAY THAT THAT'S CON THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED TAKE ON IT THEY'RE SO BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN FACT WHAT SHE IS DOING AND I SUPPOSE THE SLIGHT CHANGE THAT THERE HAS BEEN IN HER ATTITUDE TOWARDS MIGRATION IN RECENT MONTHS THAT SHE SHE'S GETTING IT RIGHT
ELMER BRAQUE CHAIRMAN OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE WERE ALWAYS TAUGHT WE'RE SUFFERING A HOUSING CRISIS WHAT IN PARTICULAR DOES THAT MEAN THOUGH IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RENT A HOME I THINK PRICES HERE WITH THAT MORE BUSINESS NEWS THANKS NICK BASICALLY IT'S GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE TO RENT TO THE ESTATE AGENT'S COUNTRY WHITE HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS JOHNNY MORRIS'S THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH DIRECTOR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE WHERE NOT WALES NOT SCOTLAND REALLY IT'S ENGLAND
YES I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE THAT YOU WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT IN THE HOUSING MARKET IN A RENTAL MARKET TO RENT HUNTLEY GROWING FASTEST IN THE SOUTH BUT ACROSS MOST OF ENGLAND AND ESPECIALLY LONDON BUT OTHER CITIES IN ENGLAND OR PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON LONDON
I THINK WE'VE SEEN THE MOST PRESSURE ON RENTAL PRICES IN LONDON CITIES DO TEND TO SEE MORE UNTIL DEMAND THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S VERY MUCH A LONDON FIRST THING AND IS THIS THE SAME PROBLEM THAT WE GET IN THERE IN THEM PURCHASE MARK MARKET IS IT IS IT IS ESSENTIALLY A LACK OF SUPPLY
THAT IS THE BACKGROUND TO THE HALL THAT THE WHOLE STORY REALLY IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OWNS US AS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE HAVE SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
THE THE SIMPLE SOLUTION SOUNDS LIKE BUILDING MORE HOMES BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLICATED THAT THE REAL THE REAL FOCUS SHOULD BE BUILDING HOMES OF DIFFERENT TANYA'S SO NOT JUST FOR HOME OWNERSHIP HOMES FOR RENT AND ALSO SOCIAL HOUSING AS WELL
AND WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT POLICY BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT HER MAYBE CLAMPDOWN IS THE WRONG WORD BUT CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT TAX RELIEF AND THE REST WORKS FOR BUY TO LET PURCHASE AS A PROPERTY IT IS THAT CHANGING THE MARKET AS WELL
BROUGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT PURSUING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND PERHAPS DOING THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF A SMALLER BIKE TO LOOK WHAT'S THAT IS THAT HAVING THAT IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A THERE'S A RUSH TO BEAT THE STAMP DUTY DEADLINE
THE STAMP DUTY IS GOING TO GO UP ON SECOND PROPERTIES OR ON BUY TO LET PROPERTIES YES EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN THOUGH IS THAT THAT
THOSE PROPERTIES NEED TO BE REPLACED IT CAN'T JUST BE ABOUT PENALISING SMALLER LANDLORDS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW A RENTAL MARKETS AND GRAND FUTURE SO WE THINK THERE'S A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR ME THROUGH A PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTIONAL BACK FIGHT RENTED SECTOR TO GREAT AND CAN I JUST ASK YOU BRIEFLY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND WE PRESUME IF WE'VE GOT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVING INTO THIS COUNTRY
IMMIGRANTS FROM ABROAD PRESUMABLY ON MANY OF THEM ON A TEMPORARY BASIS THAT MUST PUT PRESSURE ON THE RENTAL SECTOR WELL THERE'S DEFINITELY TWO SITES EQUATION THERE'S DEMAND SILENCE OF POINT SITE SO THERE WILL BE SOME PRESSURE OFF ALL RIGHT THANKS FOR THAT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW AT EIGHT FIFTY WE'LL HAVE ADVICE ON FINANCIAL ADVICE THERE YOU GO EXCELLENT THE WAY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST
SEVEN THANK YOU MATTHEW MORE CUTS ARE COMING THE CHANCER HE'S BEEN PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT HE'LL UNVEIL THE DETAIL IN HIS BUDGET SPEECH ON WEDNESDAY GEORGE OSBORNE SAYS THEY ADD UP TO A MERE FIFTY P. IN EVERY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY THE END OF THE DECADE
FOR THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING MAKES SAM RATHER MORE START TALKING FINDING FOUR THOUSAND MILLION POUNDS FOUR BILLION TO YOU AND ME A YEAR OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS SO HE'S A LITTLE OR AN AWFUL LOT THE MAN WHO CAN TELL US IS PAUL JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES MORNING TO YOU PAUL GOOD MORNING LITTLE OR A LOT
WELL AS EVER IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT FOR FOUR BILLION POUNDS IS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY IN ANYONE'S TERMS BUT IT IS FOUR BILLION OUT OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION SO AS A FRACTION IT'S HALF OF ONE PER CENT OF TOTAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING
NOW IT WASN'T VERY LONG AGO BEFORE EATING SINCE HE SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY TO LAVISH ON TWENTY SEVEN BILLION WAS THE FIGURE I RECALL IN HIS AUTUMN STATEMENT THAT LASTED A MINI BUDGET THAT WE SAW WHAT NO IT'S BEEN GOING ON WELL I'VE SAID ONCE OR TWICE THAT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION NUMBER WAS ALWAYS MISLEADING AT ONE OF THESE SILLY NUMBERS THAT'S ACCUMULATED OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND IT WAS ACTUALLY ONLY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR BILLION IN THEIR FINAL YEAR OF THE PARLIAMENT ITSELF
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IT'S ONLY FOUR MONTHS SINCE THE AUTUMN STATEMENT AND THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS BACK THEN BUT IN THOSE FOUR MONTHS THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING QUITE AS WELL AS WE WOULD HAVE HOPED THE STOCK MARKET'S NOT BEEN DOING VERY WELL THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY NOT BEEN DOING VERY WELL THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS DOWNGRADED IT'S FORECASTS OF THINGS LIKE EARNINGS AND GROWTH OVER THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS GOING TO BE BRINGING IN LESS IN THE WAY OF TAX RECEIPTS THAN HE HOPED AND GIVE THEM
BUT HE'S GOT A FIXED TARGET FOR GETTING RID OF THE DEFICIT BY TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S LIKELY TO BE ENOUGH TO ME THAT HE NEEDS TO DO MORE IN THE WAY OF TAX INCREASES OR SPENDING CUTS IN ORDER TO REACH THAT VERY FIXED TARGET WHAT HE'S GOT AND DOING MORE IF YOU RING FENCE AN AWFUL LOT IS A LOT TOUGHER THAN IT MIGHT SOUND SO WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT JUST FIFTY P. IN EVERY HUNDRED POUNDS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING HE'S ALREADY DETERMINED THAT LOTS OF THAT HUNDRED POUNDS CAN'T BE TOUCH DOESN'T IT
THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE PROTECTING HEALTH AND PENSIONS AND OVERSEAS AID AND SCHOOLS AND SO ON THAT FIFTY P. OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED POUNDS LOOKS MORE LIKE TWO OR THREE POUNDS IN EVERY HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST OF THE BITS THAT YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING AND OF COURSE THOSE BITS LIKE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING LIKE SPENDING ON JUSTICE AND POLICE AND BUSINESS AND SO ON
ARE THE BITS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAD ALL WILL ALREADY HAVE HAD CUTS OF ALMOST ONE POUND IN THREE BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT HE'S AN ECONOMIST WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THESE RELATIVELY SMALL SUMS OF MONEY NOT SMALL TO THOSE INVOLVED OBVIOUSLY BUT SMALL IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DO YOU IN A SENSE ONE SIMPLE IF IT WEREN'T FOR A SPEECH WOULD BE BARELY PAYING ATTENTION IT'S JUST A LITTLE TWEAK UP HERE A LITTLE TO EAT DOWN THERE THAT'S LIFE
I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CHANCEL NEEDS TO BECAUSE OF THE ROLE THAT HE'S GIVEN HIM BECAUSE HE'S DOING THESE TWO A FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EVERY YEAR HE NEEDS TO MAKE PLANS ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO ALWAYS ENSURE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN BALANCE BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GUESSING HE'S GOING TO DO IS SAY THAT THESE CUTS WILL BE PLANS TO HAPPEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN FRANK WE HOPE THAT THE NUMBERS MOVE BACK IN HIS DIRECTION BEFORE HE ACTUALLY HAS TO
IMPLEMENT THEM ACTUAL OR ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TO HAPPEN I DON'T THINK WE WERE ALL LESSER SEVERALLY LEARN THIS WEEK I THINK WE'LL LEARN THIS IS HOW ALL BALANCE THEIR BOOKS IF I HAVE TO BUT FRANKLY HOPING THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE THINGS DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE VERY MUCH AT ALL TO REVERSE THIS AGAIN PAUL JOHNSON THANK YOU
WE KEEP THE TIME TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN ROB IS HERE WITH THE SPORT LOGAN ROB MORNING JUSTIN HERE'S ARSENAL ONE WHAT FOR TO LOSE THE F.A.

RIGHT MANAGER TO TAKE THEM FORWARD AND THE OPINION OF THE SUPPORTERS BECAUSE IF THAT GROW SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST HIM AND THE BOARD
IT WOULD END ON IT ON A NOTE IF WE'RE NOT TO GO ON TO WIN THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE HONOUR HONOUR THAT NOTE FOR ME BUT IT'S WRITING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I'VE GOT AVAILABILITY
AND THAT PRESSURE WILL INCREASE WON'T HIT BY THE END OF THIS WEEK IF AS EXPECTED BARCELONA ELIMINATE CASTLE FROM THE CHAMPION I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE

I RESPECT WOMEN INCREDIBLY I HAVE WOMEN
WORKING FOR ME IN POSITIONS THAT THEY'D NEVER WORK IN TERMS OF SO MANY DIFFERENT JOBS I HAD A WOMAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE BUILDING OF TRUMP TOWER MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS EVEN THOUGHT BEFORE ANYBODY WOULD HAVE EVEN THOUGHT OF IT I DID A FANTASTIC JOB THAT WOMAN WHO WASN'T PAID THE CHIEF ENGINEER ON TRUMPED OW THE BUILDING ON FIFTH AVENUE WERE HE LAUNCHED HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID SHE HAS A NAME BARBARA'S TRUMP HE'S A SMART GUY AND
HAS A THEORY ABOUT WOMEN WHICH IS SHARED WITH ME HE SAID THAT IN GENERAL MEN TEND TO BE BETTER THAN WOMEN AT WORK THEY DO ABOUT A GOOD WOMAN IS BETTER THAN TEN GOOD MAN THAT'S WHAT SAID THAT HE FELT THAT I HAD WHAT HE CALLED THE KILLER INSTINCT WHICH IT WHICH I DID I MEAN I HAVE A SURVIVOR'S INSTINCT WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A KILLER INSTINCT BECAUSE TO SURVIVE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAD TO KILL SO WHAT KIND OF THINGS THEN THAT YOU HAD DONE ATTRACTED
HIM TO YOU FOR ONE THING HE SAW THAT THAT I I WORKED IN AN ALL MALE ATMOSPHERE AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY OWN WITH THE MET BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY TOUGH MEN DONALD TRUMP TOWER USED TO HAVE MALCOLM DOWN DURING A BIT OF SHITES I MEAN WE REALLY ARE AT EACH OTHER BUT REALLY SHOUTING BOTH OF YOU YEAH
YES AND I MEAN I LOVED IT I LOVE THEIR JOB AND I LOVE THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH HIM EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY TOUGH TO WORK FOR HIM HE COULD BE VERY HARD ON YOU HOW DID YOU FALL OUT WITH HIM IN THE END WE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND THEN I WROTE THE BOOK
AND I SENT HIM A COPY OF THE BOOK AND I THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE IT BECAUSE I THINK THE BOOKERS PRESENTS HIM AS BEING SOMEWHAT LARGE IN THEIR LIVES

BUSTY BAWDY BRASSY NELL GWYN IS BEST KNOWN OF COURSE AS THE COURTESAN OF CHARLES THE SECOND SHE ALSO PERHAPS ALSO THE FIRST FEMINIST TO TAKE TO THE WEST END STAGE THE ROLE OF NOW IS CURRENTLY BEING PLAYED AT THE SHOW OF THE SAME BY GEMMA ALTERED BEFORE PLAYING HER OTTERTON STARRED AS THE FACTORY WORKER WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR EQUAL PAY IN MADE IN DAGENHAM SHE'S ESTABLISHED HER OWN PRODUCTION COMPANY WHICH FOCUSES ON WORK WRITTEN PRODUCED AND STORING WOMEN
ALL QUITE A CHANGE FOR AN ACTOR WHO FIRST CAME TO PUBLIC ATTENTION AS A BOND GIRL
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHO NELL GWYN ONCE BEFORE INNIT REMEMBER SOMEONE INTERVIEWED ME RECENTLY AND SAID I'D PLAYED NOW GWYN UNIVERSITY COS I WAS BUSTING AND I THOUGHT OH GOD SO NOT HOW IT IS AND IT'S WONDERFUL IN THAT SHE IS THIS
I MEAN SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH A FORWARD THINKING BRAVE INTELLIGENT WOMAN TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT SHE DID
IN THE PERIOD THAT SHE WAS IN WHICH WAS GO ON THE STAGE B. ONE OF THE FIRST ACTRESSES ON STAGE IN FRONT OF ALL THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS A VERY SORT OF PROMISCUOUS PLACE TO BE PROVED HERSELF AS A GREAT COMIC ACTRESS
AND AND THEN BECOME A MEMBER OF COURT ILLEGITIMATE MEMBER OF COURT SHE OBVIOUSLY WAS SOMEONE BEYOND HER TIME OBVIOUSLY THERE IS STILL THAT FUN IN THE BAWDINESS AND THE JOKES AND IAN IT'S NAUGHTY AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S BRILLIANT ABOUT HER AS WELL IS THAT SHE'S NOT JUST SOME INTELLECTUAL YOU KNOW STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE CHARACTER SHE'S FUN
SEXY BUT ALSO PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES YOU SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE SORT OF CARRY ON NUDGE NUDGE NAUGHTINESS AND OTHER TIMES I FEEL I'M HEARING A SORT OF FEMINIST PROCLAMATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF WOMEN ON STAGE
IT'S FEMINIST WITHOUT BEING STAMPY AND SHOUTY WHICH IS VERY BORING I FIND THAT FEMINISM QUITE BORING AND IT'S INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY AND SORT OF JOKES ITSELF LAUGHS ITSELF AND I THINK THAT THAT GETS THE MESSAGE ACROSS MUCH STRONGER THAN WHEN YOU'RE KIND OF SHOUTING AT PEOPLE ABOUT
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT ON THE STAGE LET ALONE IN THE MOVIES I CAMPAIGN FOR EQUAL PAY BUT THERE IS A SENSE THAT THERE'S A HEAD OF STEAM BUILDING ISN'T THERE AMONGST WOMEN WHO WERE SAYING ACTUALLY IT IS TIME WE WERE PAID LIKE THE MET
I THINK IT'S BECOMING MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT AND PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO OR THEY FEEL ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT IT I OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE EQUAL PAY I THINK THAT IT DEPENDS ON THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING I THINK EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK I BELIEVE HIM
AND I THINK IN T.V. AND FILM AND ON STAGE IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THAT WORK OUT WHAT IS EQUAL WHO IS ACTUALLY THE STAR BILLING USE DRAWING IN THE AUDIENCE THERE IS THAT I MEAN
I STARTED PRODUCING NOW ON THAT I'M FEELING THIS FIRST HAND YOU GET A PROJECT AND YOU SAY CAN I PUT THESE ACTORS IN IT AND ONE'S GOING TO HAVE MORE CURRENCY THAN THE OTHER SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF EQUAL
WHAT DOES IT MEAN THEY MIGHT BRING TWO MILLION POUNDS TO THE PROJECT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THEM IT'S A IT'S A DEBATABLE THING I'M INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA THAT YOU BECOME A BOSS IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU SET UP THIS PRODUCTION COMPANY HAVEN'T UNIT AND IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
ON HOW IT WORK YEAH I ATE IT BUT THERE'S EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THE SYSTEM I STILL DON'T AGREE WITH THE SISTER
THERE'S BEEN TIMES WHERE I'VE GONE INTO A MEETING WITH THE FINANCIER AND THERE AND IT'S A FILM ABOUT A WOMAN AND THEY SAY YEAH BUT CAN WE WRITE UP THE MANX OTHERWISE WE WON'T FINANCE IT AND I'M LIKE NO IT'S ABOUT A WOMAN THE MIGHT MALE PART IS A SMALL PART AND I KNOW THAT JESSICA'S WHERE THE PLAYWRIGHT FOR GWEN SHE'S GOT MANY FILM PROJECTS THAT SHE'S JUST TAKEN AWAY FROM THE FILM COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DID THEY WON'T FINANCE IT WITH A WOMAN SO I JUST THINK YOU KNOW
THERE'S THE SYSTEM IN THE WAY IT WORKS AND THERE'S THE PEOPLE WITH THE POWER AND THE MONEY PEOPLE HAD THE MONEY SO
THAT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO CHANGE AND IT MEANS CHANGE THE WHOLE THING I WAS LOOKING AT SOME STARTLING FIGURES LESS THAN TWO PER CENT OF SCREEN DIRECTORS WOMEN LESS THAN ONE IN EIGHT REUTERS WOMEN FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE PRODUCERS WOMEN THERE'S A DRAMATIC CHANGE NEEDED IN THE INDUSTRIES
YEAH BASICALLY I THINK THE YOUNGER GENERATION I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH AND I THINK IT IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF PRODUCERS TO EMPLOY FEMALE DIRECTORS AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP PROJECTS IF I'M DEVELOPING A PROJECT AS A PRODUCER IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE IT TO A FEMALE DIRECTOR
OR MAKE SURE I GET RELATIONSHIPS WITH FEMALE WRITERS BECAUSE THERE ARE LOADS OF THEM
THEY'RE JUST NOT KICK BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO OR BEEN GIVEN THE MONEY TO DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO GENERALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU NELL GWYN IS RUNNING AT THE APOLLO THEATRE IN LONDON UNTIL THE THIRTIETH OF APRIL AND GEMMA IS UP FOR AN OLIVIER AWARD AS IS THE PLAY
TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A NEWCASTLE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON WHO IS PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING JUSTIN
THE NAME OF SPORT RELIEF ON FRIDAY WE'LL CELEBRATE ALL OF THE WALKING RUNNING SWIMMING CYCLING WITH THE HELP OF FRANK SPENCER SMITHY AND PETER CROUCH JOINING DAVID WALLIAMS AS A LADY
TWO YEARS AGO IT RAISED OVER FIFTY ONE MILLION POUNDS ON THE NIGHT AND THE GENEROSITY OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC THROUGH YEARS OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS RAISED A STAGGERING TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION POUNDS
THE INVOLVEMENT OF SPORTS STARS AND ENCOURAGING GIVING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS APPROACH BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THERE'S ONE ELEMENT WHICH JUST RAISES A QUESTION IN MY MIND
WHILE MANY SPORTS MEN AND WOMEN AREN'T EARNING HIGH AMOUNTS AND EVEN STRUGGLE TO GET SPONSORSHIP PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALLERS ARE IN A DIFFERENT LEAGUE
THE DELIGHT ANNUAL REVIEW OF FOOTBALL FINANCES SHOWS THAT IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN SEASON WHERE WAGES FOR PREMIERSHIP CLUBS TOTALLED ONE POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS
NEXT SEASON'S TELEVISION DEAL WILL BRING A RECORD FIVE BILLION INTO THE CLUBS WITH THE RECENT FEAR OF SUPPORTERS THAT IT WILL GO TO THE PLAYERS RATHER THAN REDUCE TICKET BRYCE
EVERY PREMIERSHIP PLAYER DONATED JUST TWO WEEKS' WAGES IT WOULD BY ITSELF EASILY EXCEED THE AMOUNT RAISED LAST TIME BY SPORT RELIEF THAT WOULD STILL LEAVE THE AVERAGE FOOTBALLER WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION POUNDS TO MANAGE THE OTHER FIFTY WEEKS OF THE YEAR
OF COURSE MANY DO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN A CHAT RANGE OF CHARITABLE WORK AND TO BE HONEST I FIND IT FAR TOO EASY TO POINT THE FINGER AT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO GENEROSITY SOMETIMES TO AVOID MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY
IN THE CONTEXT OF OFFERINGS GIVEN IN THE TEMPLE JESUS ONCE COMMENDED TO HIS DISCIPLES THE REAL SACRIFICE OF A COUPLE OF COINS FROM A POOR WIDOW COMPARED TO THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE RICH
AS A CHRISTIAN I FIND MYSELF CONTINUALLY CHALLENGED BY THIS NOT TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE BUT TO THINK ABOUT MY OWN GIVING
ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU SUGGESTS THAT GENEROSITY COMES FROM SEEM AT EVERYTHING WE HAVE AND EVERYTHING WE ACCOMPLISH COMES FROM GOD'S GRACE AND GOD'S LOVE FOR US
HE GOES ON TO POINT OUT THAT IN THE AFRICAN UNDERSTANDING OF A BUN TO OUR GENEROSITY ALSO COMES FROM REALISING THAT WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WITHOUT THE SUPPORT LOVE AND GENEROSITY OF OTHERS
REALISING THAT ALL I HAD WAS A GIFT FROM GOD OR A GIFT FROM OTHERS COMBATS MY INNATE SELFISHNESS
AND MIGHT JUST SUSTAIN THIS UNFIT MIDDLE AGED ACADEMIC DURING THE SIX MILES FOR SPORT RELIEF ALONG HARTLEPOOL SEAFRONT ON SATURDAY MORNING
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY TIME NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHAT AGE IS A CHILD TOO YOUNG TO BE LEFT ALONE IN THE HOUSE OR IN A CAR WHEN THERE'S HER PARENTS NEED TO LOOK AFTER SOMETHING OR SOMEONE ELSE BECOME CRIMINAL NEGLECT A B.B.C. SURVEY OF POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED ARRESTS FOR LEAVING A CHILD ALONE
IN THE PAST YEAR IN THE TRUE FIGURE COULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT AS A THIRD OF FORCES DIDN'T REPLY TO OUR QUESTIONS WELL WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY ANGELA MALLS KNOWS THE LAW SHE'S A FAMILY LOTS OF LISTER AND ALSO BY TIM HAINES WHO WAS PROSECUTED FOR LEAVING HIS TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ALONE IN THE CAR FOR TEN MINUTES WHEN HE RETURNED HE FOUND THE POLICE WERE WAITING FOR HIM MORNING TO YOU TIM WHEN YOU TOOK THAT DECISION
DID IT FEEL LIKE A DECISION FRANKLY WE JUST POPPING OFF TO DO SOMETHING HE NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT THERE WAS A GREAT PROBLEM THEY'VE CERTAINLY DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEM AT ALL I LEFT MY DAUGHTER IN A CAR OUTSIDE A CHEMIST'S SHOP SHE WAS BARELY OUT OF SIGHT I WAS ONLY ACTUALLY GONE FOR FIVE MINUTES
AND WHEN YOU RETURN THERE IN THE POLICE AND IT DIDN'T STOP THERE DID IT WELL THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEEM TOO CONCERNED ABOUT MY DAUGHTER AT THE TIME THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY SAID THE CAR HAD A BALD TYRE BUT TWO WEEKS LATER THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND THERE WERE TWO OFFICERS WHO HAD COME ROUND TO ARREST ME ON THE GROUNDS OF NEGLECT INDEED YES AND YOU'VE MANAGED TO IN THE END FIGHT OFF THIS CONVICTION BUT AFTER A VERY VERY LONG PROCESS ONLY TOOK FIFTEEN MONTHS AND I WAS TAKEN TO THE MAGISTRATE'S COURT WHERE WE INITIALLY I WAS CONVICTED
I WAS GIVEN AN ABSOLUTE DISCHARGE WHICH IN LAW MEANS THAT THERE IS NO MORAL CULPABILITY BUT I WAS NONETHELESS MORTIFIED THAT I HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF AN OFFENCE OF CHILD ABUSE AND MY SOLICITOR SAID DON'T APPEAL LIKE I GOT A BARRISTER'S OPINION WHICH SAID DON'T APPEAL BUT I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I APPEALED AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE HE SAID FIVE MINUTES THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A CRIME
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHO IT WAS AT THE C.P.S. WHO'D WHO'D BROUGHT THE PROSECUTION AND HOPED HE WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE BAR LET'S BRING IN ANGELA MALLS NOW WHAT IS THE LAW AND WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY WHICH AFFECTS MY HAYNES AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALL THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT POP INTO A SHOP I WAS A CHILD EITHER AT HOME OR INDEED A CHILD IN THE CAR
GOOD MORNING I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES HERE IS IT IS UNCLEAR THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS ACT SAYS THAT A PARENT CAN BE PROSECUTED FOR NEGLECT AND THE COLLECT IS LEAVING THEIR CHILD ALONE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE CHILD IS AT RISK
NOW OF COURSE THAT IS WHERE THE DISCRETION COMES IN THERE HAS TO BE A SPECTRUM HERE BETWEEN A MINOR MOMENTARY ERROR OF JUDGEMENT TO THE MORE FLAGRANT LEAVING HAVE A CHILD WITH A CLEAR DANGER OF HARM AT RISK IS THE KEY BUT IS THERE AN AGE IN THE LAW AT ALL NO NOT AT ALL THERE IS NO MINIMUM AGE SET DOWN TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK IN THEY OFTEN DO DON'T THEY THEIR WITS FOURTEEN THERE'S NOTHING THERE IT'S SIMPLY A JUDGEMENT THAT IS MADE
P. C. C. HAVE A RECOMMENDATION THAT NO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE I SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE FOR LONG PERIODS BUT THERE AGAIN WHAT CONSTITUTES A LONG PERIOD
BABIES TODDLERS AND CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT ALONE THAT IS CLEAR BUT YOU KNOW WHEN SHOULD A CHILD BE LEFT FOR TEN MINUTES TO POP ROUND TO A NEIGHBOUR IT IS SIR DISCRETION AT THEIR PARENTS SO IN LEGAL TERMS WHAT IS THE KEY TO A JUDGEMENT THEN ABOUT WHETHER THE RISK IS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO PROSECUTE FOR NEGLECT WHAT FACTORS WOULD BE EXAMINED
THE COURT IS GOING TO LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS UNNECESSARY SUFFERING OR WHETHER THERE WAS INJURY TO HEALTH SO THOSE ARE THE BENCHMARKS THAT THE COURT IS LOOKING FOR FOR AN OFFENCE
AND PRESUMABLY TIM HAINES THAT'S THE CALCULATION THAT ANY PARENT HAS TO MAKE IS THAT YOU PRESUMABLY THOUGHT IN YOUR CAR SEAT THAT THEIR TWO YEAR OLD I'VE NO CHANCE OF MOVING NO CHANCE COMING TO HARM ABOUT TWO YEAR OLD BEEN IN YOUR KITCHEN THOUGH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A RISK WITH MAIR OF THEM FALLING OVER OR HAVE THEM EATING SOMETHING THEY SHOULD NOT PUTTING THEIR FINGERS IN THE WRONG SOCKET OR WHATEVER
ONE OF COURSE EVERY SITUATION IS DIFFERENT AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT AS WELL THOSE COMBINATIONS OF CHILDREN CHILDREN TO HAVE SIBLINGS AND WHEN IS IT APPROPRIATE TO LEAVE A YOUNGER CHILD WITH AN OLDER SIBLING
YES AND WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THAT ONE AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE PARENTS IN LAW THE PARENT HAS GIVEN PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU ARE MORE DISCRETION CLEARLY ANGELA MOST DO YOU THINK THE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS IS JUST TO BE GROWN UP AND ALLOW DISCRETION OR DO YOU THINK THE LAW NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED
I'M WITH TIM CHILDREN COME IN ALL DIFFERENT SHAPES SIZES AND MATURITY IN THERE COME IN ALL DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF SIBLINGS BUT THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH I DON'T THINK IS THE ANSWER WE HAVE TO ACT AS PARENTS AT ALL TIMES AND MAKE JUDGEMENT CALLS AND SOMETIMES OCCASIONALLY AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE JUDGEMENT CALLS ARE WRONG AND IF IT IS ONLY A MINOR JUDGEMENT
THEN I THINK THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT BY THE POLICE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY BY MAYBE A WARNING OR A CAUTION BUT NOT A PROSECUTION BRIEFLY TIM IF YOU WOULD IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU SIMPLY TO APPEAL YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO PRODUCE A CARE PLAN TO PROVE THAT YOU KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER YOUR OTHER CHILDREN HELLO THAT WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER ALL TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME I WAS BEING DRAGGED THROUGH THE CRIMINAL COURTS A FAMILY WAS BEING ATTACKED BY SOCIAL SERVICES WHO HAULED US THROUGH THE CIVIL COURTS AS WELL
AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW IN DETAIL I LIKE HOW YOU INTENDED TO LOOK AFTER HER THEY WANTED TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL ABOUT US AND ABOUT OUR LIFE AND ABOUT OUR CHILDREN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING REALLY CAN I SAY NICK THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME MOST OF ALL ABOUT THIS IS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND I FIND THAT A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT ALONG SIMILAR LINES WAS MADE BY THE PRESS ASSOCIATION AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE PARENTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
THIS YEAR IT'S FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN WHAT'S CHANGED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WILL CHECK THAT OUT I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME PERIOD THEY WERE DOING THREE MONTHS WE WERE DOING BUT WE'RE OUT OF TIME NOW WE'LL WE'LL TWEET THE ANSWER WHEN WE WE'VE CHECKED IT OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED BOTH OF YOU TIM HAINES ANGELA MOORE'S THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT STABBED

A PROPOSED DEAL TO STEM THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN GREECE IS FACING SERIOUS LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES DAYS BEFORE EUROPEAN LEADERS MEET TO FINALISE IT
BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THAT ANY ATTEMPT BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO WORDS U.K. VOTERS TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. WOULD BE OUTRAGEOUS HYPOCRISY AND A NEW MISSION TO DISCOVER IF THERE'S LIFE ON MARS IS PREPARING FOR LIFT OFF THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY SUSAN

THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS INITIAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE ATTACK SHOULD CONCLUDE TODAY BY WHICH TIME EVER RELEASE THE NAME OF THE GROUP IT BELIEVES WAS BEHIND IT INITIAL INDICATION SAY OFFICIALS POINT TO THE P.K.K. THE KURDISH GUERRILLA GROUP WITH WHICH THE STATE HAS BEEN FIGHTING A RENEWED CONFLICT SINCE LAST JULY A P.K.K. OFFSHOOT SAID IT WAS BEHIND LAST MONTH'S CAR BOMB IN ANKARA
PRESIDENT AND ONE SAID THE ATTACKS THREATEN TURKEYS INTEGRITY AND UNITY BUT DO NOT WEAKEN ITS RESOLVE VOWING TO BRING TERRORISM TO ITS KNEES THERE WILL THEY BE SERIOUS QUESTIONS OVER HIS GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SECURITY AFTER THREE ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL IN FIVE MONTHS DESPITE A WARNING FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY THEY'RE JUST TWO DAYS AGO THAT AN INCIDENT WAS BEING PLANNED THIS NERVOUS COUNTRY NOW SEEMS LOCKED IN A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE WERE THREATS FROM MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS TURKEY FEELS VULNERABLE
AN ANTI IMMIGRATION PARTY HAS MADE BIG GAINS IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN GERMANY IN WHAT'S BEING SEEN AS A SHARP REBUKE BY VOTERS TO ANGELA ANGELA MERKEL'S OPEN DOOR POLICY FOR REFUGEES THE CHANCELLOR'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES AT THE HANDS OF THE ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND PARTY THE F. D. IT WON SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN REGIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN ALL THREE STATES THAT VOTED YESTERDAY HERE'S OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT JENNY HILL
I'M GOING TO MERKEL ONCE DISMISSED ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND AS A SMALL FRINGE PARTY IT'S A COMMENT SHE MAY NOW REGRET A.F. DE IS FIERCELY OPPOSED TO HER REFUGEE POLICY ITS LEADER RECENTLY SUGGESTED BORDER GUARDS SHOULD SHOOT AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

JUST THREE OF THE COUNTRY SIXTEEN STATES HELD ELECTIONS YESTERDAY BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME GERMAN VOTERS HAVE DELIVERED THEIR VERDICT ON MISSUS MERKEL'S ASYLUM POLICY AND THERE'S A GENERAL ELECTION HERE NEXT YEAR
THERE'S BEEN NO REACTION TO THE RESULTS SO FAR FROM ANGELA MERKEL SHE'LL MEET SENIOR MEMBERS OF HER PARTY LATER THIS MORNING ELM A BROCK A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FROM MISSUS MERKEL C.D. YOU TOLD US THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS INTO GERMANY HAD NOW STABILISED SOMETHING THAT HAD YET TO BE WIDELY APPRECIATED
A PROPOSED DEAL TO END THE MIGRANT CRISIS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS RUNNING INTO SERIOUS LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES UNDER THE AGREEMENT TURKEY WOULD TAKE BACK ALL ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARRIVING ON THE GREEK ISLANDS ARE THE E. YOU WOULD ACCEPT AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SYRIANS FROM TURKISH CAMPS SPEED UP TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION AND BRING FORWARD PLANS TO ALLOW TAX VISA FREE TRAVEL
THE DEAL IS DUE TO BE FINALISED AT A SUMMIT LATER THIS WEEK IT FACES CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION AS OUR EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS FROM BRUSSELS
THE DRAFT DEAL HAS RUN INTO A STORM OF PROTEST FROM THE U.N. AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS IMMORAL AND ILLEGAL LAWYERS ARE SCRAMBLING TO DEVISE A PLAN THAT WOULD HELP MEET THE E. USE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS NEW LEGISLATION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO PASS THROUGH BOTH THE GREEK AND TURKISH PARLIAMENT'S RIGHT OF ANYONE SEEKING ASYLUM TO APPEAL AGAINST THEIR RETURN TO TURKEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE GUARANTEED AND EVERY CASE WOULD HAVE TO BE HEARD INDIVIDUALLY BEFORE A TRIBUNAL
THE PROPOSED DEAL ALSO INCLUDES NUMEROUS INCENTIVES FOR TURKEY BUT SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES ARE UNHAPPY THEY CAN BE NO SHORT CUT THEY INSIST TO VISA FREE TRAVEL FOR TURKEY CITIZENS TO THE SHANG AREA AND CYPRESSES WARNED THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO BLOCK NEW NEGOTIATIONS ON TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP BID AND TURKEY CHANGED ITS POLICY AND RECOGNISED THE GREEK CYPRIOT GOVERNMENT AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF THE WHOLE ISLAND THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFICULT DIPLOMACY STILL TO BE DONE THIS WEEK
THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID ANY INTERVENTION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD BE A PIECE OF OUTRAGEOUS AND EXORBITANT HYPOCRISY IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT MISTER OBAMA WILL VISIT LONDON NEXT MONTH AND IRISH PEOPLE TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. THE WHITE HOUSE'S SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT THE U.S. SUPPORT A STRONG UNITED KINGDOM IN A STRONG EUROPEAN UNION MISTER JOHNSON MAKES HIS COMMENTS IN HIS COLUMN IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
IN TYPICALLY COLOURFUL LANGUAGE BORIS JOHNSON DISMISSES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXPECTED ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP AS HOLY FALLACIOUS AMERICA HE SAYS WOULD NEVER ACCEPT THE SORT OF CONSTRAINTS ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY IMPOSED ON THE U.K. BY THE E.U. THE NORTH ATLANTIC FREE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. MEXICO AND CANADA HE NOTES IS A FREE TRADE DEAL WITHOUT AN E. YOU STYLED CAUGHT COMMISSION OR PARLIAMENT
THE E.U. SAYS MISTER JOHNSON ISN'T SUITED TO BECOMING A UNITED STATES OF EUROPE HAS SOME IN WASHINGTON HOPE BECAUSE IT LACKS A SINGLE CULTURE LANGUAGE OR ALLEGIANCE MY JOHNSON'S REMARKS HOWEVER WILL ALSO SERVED TO UNDERLINE THE APPARENT LACK OF SUPPORT FOR BRECHT SAID NOT JUST IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT MORE GENERALLY AMONG THE WORLD LEADERS
GOVERNMENT IS THE GOVERNMENT IS LAUNCHING AN INITIATIVE TO ENCOURAGE LOW INCOME WORKERS TO SAVE MORE THEY HELP TO SAVE SCHEME WILL BE OPEN TO AROUND THREE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE ON UNIVERSAL CREDIT ARE WORKING TAX CREDIT HE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
WITH WESTMINSTER GRIPPED BY E.U. REFERENDUM FERVOUR DAVID CAMERON'S FOCUS TODAY IS A REMINDER OF WHAT HE'D LIKE HIS FINAL YEARS AS PRIME MINISTER TO BE REMEMBERED FOR WHAT HE CALLED AN ALL OUT ASSAULT ON POVERTY IN HIS PARTY CONFERENCE SPEECH LAST AUTUMN

AFTER ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF SAVING THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANOTHER BONUS AGAIN UP TO SIX HUNDRED POUNDS THE MONEY COULD BE SPENT ON ANYTHING THE SAVER WANTED BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THE SCHEME IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS SUGGEST MINISTERS DON'T EXPECT MANY OF THOSE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE
THE ISLAMIST GROUP BAL KINDER IN THE ISLAMIC MY GRAHAM HAS SAID IT WAS BEHIND THE GUN ATTACK ON A BEACH RESORT IN THE WEST AFRICAN STATE OF IVORY COAST YESTERDAY FOURTEEN CIVILIANS AND TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED THAT GRAND BY SOME TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CITY I'LL BE JAN FROM ABIDJAN TAMASIN FAULT REPORTS

ADDS TO A GROWING SENSE THAT TURKEY IS BECOMING ITSELF DANGEROUSLY UNSTABLE THE ATTACK YESTERDAY WAS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MASS MURDERS IN TURKEY TURKEY WHICH IS OF COURSE SUCH A KEY PLAYER IN THE SYRIAN CRISIS TURKEY WHICH HAS SUCH A PIVOTAL PLACE OF THE REFUGEE CRISIS IS TO BE SOLDIER AND LEAST PRODUCED TURKEY WHICH STILL SEES EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP AS A LONG TERM AIM

KURDISH TARGETS IN NORTHERN IRAQ THERE'S ALSO BEEN A REPORT OF A DECLARATION OF A CURFEW AND A MAINLY KURDISH SOUTH EASTERN TURKISH TOWN NO QUESTION FROM THE AUTHORITY'S POINT OF VIEW OF WHO THEY THINK WAS RESPONSIBLE DO YOU THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY THERE RIGHT I THINK THAT THE ATTACK IN ANKARA
THERE'S THE HALLMARK OF THE CURD ESTAN WORK AS PART OF THE PEA DECAY THE FACT THAT THE PICNIC TENDS TO TARGET GOVERNMENT OFFICES SECURITY FORCES OR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS
WHERE'S THE ISLAMIC STATE GOES FOR SOFT TARGETS SUCH AS TOURISTS KURDISH ACTIVISTS AND LEFT WING ACTIVISTS AND APART FROM THOSE IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE LONGER TERM IN THE WEEKS TO COME IS THE GOVERNMENT'S LIGHTLY RESPONSE AND MORE OF THE SAME OR MORE IT'S SICK OR SECURITY BASED
FOCUSED RESPONSE SUCH AS TARGETING THE CREDIT SAMBUCUS PARTY IN THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN IRAQ PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT GO FURTHER AND TRY TO PROSECUTE SOME OF THE PRO KURDISH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN THE FUTURE AND IN TERMS OF
TURKISH SOCIETY WRIT LARGE WHAT DOES THIS
DO WHAT DOES IT DO TIP A GOOD WE WERE HEARING REPORTS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WAS CLOSED DOWN IMMEDIATELY IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH
ATTACK YESTERDAY OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WILL BE DEEPLY DEEPLY FEARFUL BUT IN POLITICAL TERMS WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE STABILITY OF PRESIDENT DOWN TO UM TO THAT STABILITY OF TURKISH SOCIETY PRESENT THERE IT ONCE POLICY SEEMS TO BE DRAGGING TURKEY TO THE HEART OF THE FACTIONAL SECTARIAN
AND A DISPUTE HAD ITS CHASMS TELLING THE MIDDLE EAST
A PART I THINK PRESIDENT AT I THINK THE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT MUCH DISCUSSION GOING ON IN TURKEY ON CONVINCING THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE ITS POLICY OF WHAT COULD HE DO THAT THAT WOULD STOP ATTACKS LIKE THIS FIRST OF ALL I THINK PRESENT AIRED THE ONE
SHOULD GO BACK TO OR RE OPENING PEACE TALKS WITH KURDISH THE MODERATE KURDISH NATIONALISTS TAKE A MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO SYRIA AND RESTORE HER TIES WITH RUSSIA WITH IRAQ
AND ANT AND WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES DIFFICULT ONE FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS OF COURSE HAVE THIS DESPERATE BALANCING ACT AT THE MOMENT WITH PRESIDENT OUT HAD ONE WITH WITH WITH TURKEY WHERE THEY WERE DESPERATELY DESPERATELY NEED HELP BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE ALL SORTS OF MISGIVINGS ABOUT DEALING WITH TURKEY WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OF
ASSISTANCE OR LACK OF ASSISTANCE WHAT DO YOU THINK EUROPE SHOULD DO NOW SHOULD EUROPE CARRY ON AND TRY TO DO THE DEAL INCLUDING THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL OR IS THIS A MOMENT UP TO HOLD BACK I THINK YOU SHOULD ADOPT A MORE ROBUST APPROACH TOWARDS TURKEY TO PERSUADE TURKEY TO A TWO
TO BETTER CONTROLLED THE BORDER WITH SYRIA TO HER OP DUE TO RESUME PEACE TALKS WITH MODERATE KURDISH NATIONALISTS AND TO RESTORE HER TIES WITH THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES INCLUDING IRAN RUSSIA AND IRAQ FREDDIE OCCUR FROM CHATHAM HOUSE IN LONDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY JOINED ON THE LINE I THINK BY OWNER OR MAN WHO IS A FORMER TURKISH AMBASSADOR TO NATO JOINS US FROM HIS IN TURKEY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WITH MORNING DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF EUROPE WAS MORE ROBUST AND WE'VE JUST HEARD THAT WORD USED WITH PRESIDENT ADDER ONE BUT IT COULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION IN TURKEY
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY HE HEAVEN THAT HAVE SO FAR WITNESSED THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS REAL ASSISTANCE SHE'LL SOLIDARITY OF OUR ALLIES AND YOU GUESS OUR FIGHTS IT'S P.K.K. IN THE LAST FOUR DECADES BECAUSE THEIR HEADQUARTERS SENT THOSE THE CAMPS OR DECAYS IN MODERN IRAQ
YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS FROM EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN FRIENDS TO SIT AT THE TABLE WITH TERRORIST AND TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT BUT THAT'S RECEIVED ANY MESSAGE THEY HAVE NOT SEEN IN A MESSAGE AGAIN NO BUT I'VE GOT GOVERNMENT OR TO BULBS I NEED TO KEYCARD P.K.K. FROM LADEN IRAQ WHO'S IN CHARGE IN LORD NEARER WEREN'T TOTALLY WANTS TO INTERFERE
IN THAT IT LOOKS AS IF WE HAD LOST THE LINE THERE ARE THE LINE'S GONE VERY BAD HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND LET US SEE WHETHER WE CAN DO NOW I'M AND CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME CAN WE HEAR YOU LET HER
I'M AFRAID THE LINE'S COME BACK TO FIND HE HAD A GREAT IT'S A REASONABLE POINT ISN'T IT WITH A THAT THAT INNIT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR TURKEY AND THIS IS A FIGHT THAT TAKE OR DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT ON THE OTHER HAND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WESTERN POWERS OTHER PUZZLE AS WELL FIGHTING ISLAMIC STATE AND INDEED FIGHTING PRESIDENT ASAD IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT
BUT THOSE KURDISH FORCES ARE ABLE TO BE HAD COURTED IN THOSE AREAS IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND ALSO ON THE BORDER BETWEEN SYRIAN TURKEY AND ARE ABLE TO OPERATE ADDITIONAL NO DOUBT THAT EUROPE COULD SURE BUT WHAT'S ALLOWED SOLIDARITY WAS TURKEY BUT READ IT INITIATIVE LIES WITH THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR TWO AND A HALF YEARS
THERE WAS A THERE WAS AT THERE WAS A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TURKISH SECURE BETWEEN THE TURKISH MILITARY AND A KURDISH FOR A KURDISH NATIONALIST FIGHTERS THE PRETTIEST TAMWAR CHRIS PARTY WONDER WAS ONGOING WHEN THERE WAS A PEACE TALKS
TAKING PLACE SO I THINK THAT THE BEST WAY FORWARD IS IT POLITICAL SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THE RESOLUTION OF THE KURDISH QUESTION IN TURKEY IS POLITICAL RATHER THAN MILLER THAT SECURE IT ON MILITARY BUT AND IF THERE IS A CEASEFIRE THAT CONTINUES TO HOLD IN SYRIA AND IF THERE IS REAL PROGRESS MADE IN THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS START AGAIN IN GENEVA AND THESE ARE TWO MASSIVE IFS OF COURSE IF THAT HAPPENS DOES THAT THEN
ASSIST IN DRAWING TO A CLOSE AT THESE THIS PHASE OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND THE KURDISH FACTIONS I THINK THAT IF THERE IS A PACIFICATION OF THE A QUAGMIRE IN SYRIA THIS WILL HELP THE PROSPECTS OF RESOLUTION BETWEEN DE KURDISH NATIONALISTS ANDY
TURKISH GOVERNMENT AT THE CURRENT THE KURDISH FIGHTERS THAT CONTROL MUCH OF THE OF THE BORDER BETWEEN TURKEY AND SYRIA ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE BEAKER CURED HER CREDIT STAN WALKER SPORTY SO NATURALLY ANY PEACE IN SYRIA WILL HAVE HER WILL HAVE A POSITIVE SPILL OVER INTO TOOK ITSELF HE WE'VE HAD ONLY DID EUROSCEPTICS IN THIS COUNTRY SAYING LOOK THIS IS ALL
IT'S AWFUL WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TURKEY GENUINELY AWFUL BUT IT ALSO SUGGESTS TO US THAT TURKEY IS MUST BE KEPT SEPARATE FROM EUROPE AND WE SEE THE PLANS FOR VISA FREE TRAVEL WE SEE THE LONGER TERM PLANS EVEN FOR TURKEY TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS YET ANOTHER REASON TO STAY AWAY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO STUDIES TURKEY KNOWS ABOUT IT WHAT DOES THE PROSPECT OF JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE THE IMPACT IN TURKEY OF BRINGING TURKEY
CLOSER TO BEING A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING MODERN DEMOCRACY OR IS IT ACTUALLY A SOCK THAT IS BEING USED BY SOME IN THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES TO CARRY ON BEHAVING AS THEY DO
AND THE TURKISH ACCESSION PUT HER PROCESSORS WITH HER PRETTY MUCH A PANTOMIME IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AT LEAST IN MY LIFETIME
NEITHER OF THE EUROPE ONCE ATE MORE DE TURKEY WHAT'S THAT IS IT A NECESSARY PANTOMIME DOES IT HAVE AN EFFECT WAS HAVE AN IMPACT THAT IS POSITIVE I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY EFFECT WHATSOEVER TO THE EUROPE DOES NO LONGER PLACES ANY DOCTOR DEMANDS ON TURKEY TO IMPROVE ITS DEMOCRACY HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
BUDDY HOW CORA FROM CHATHAM HAS ANOTHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT'S JUST A NOTE ON ONE OF THOSE ONLY IN TELEVISION'S STORIES THE FRONT PAGE OF A NUMBER OF THE PAPERS HAVE GOT A PHOTOGRAPH OF A MUSTANG SMOKE STEAMING FROM ITS WHEELS APPARENTLY JUST A FEW FEET AWAY FROM THE CENOTAPH CLOTS GEAR IS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN A CENOTAPH STUNT DISRESPECT IS THE SUB HEADLINE BECAUSE HE'S QUOTING COLONEL RICHARD KEMP IS TALK DAILY TELEGRAPH IT WAS GRAVELY DISRESPECTFUL
FOR THE TOP GEAR TEAM CHRIS EVANS AND HIS TEAM TO FILM NEXT TO THE CENOTAPH WELL AT THE TIME OF THE STUNT THE B. B. C. ORIGINALLY SAID THE FILMING TOOK PLACE A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE CENOTAPH AND IT WAS ALL AGREED WITH WESTMINSTER COUNCIL AND ADVANCE A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE CHRIS EVANS HE'S ON ANOTHER RADIO STATION THIS MORNING AS HE IS EVERY AS YOU KNOW HE'S HAD SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT TO SAY
THE IMAGES ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPERS THEY DOESN'T MATTER IT'S IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THAT COULD EXPLAIN THIS AWAY WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS WHAT THESE IMAGES LOOK LIKE HER BUT THEY LOOK THEY LOOK ENTIRELY DISRESPECTFUL WHICH OF COURSE WAS NOT I WOULD NEVER BE THE INTENTION OF THE TOP GEAR TEAM OR MATT
THESE PICTURES ARE TAKEN WITH A LONG LENS CAMERA FROM I BELIEVE PARLIAMENT SQUARE BUT THE POINT IS IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AT ALL WHATSOEVER AND SO ON BEHALF OF THE TOP GEAR TEAM AND MATT I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE UNRESERVEDLY FOR WHAT THESE IMAGES SEEM TO PORTRAY
SEEM TO PEDRO I SHOULD HAVE SAID IS MATT LE BLANC WHO WAS HIS CO STAR IN TOP GEAR THE AMERICAN ACTOR WHO WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR NOT CHRIS EVANS HIMSELF THE B.B.C. PRESS OFFICER'S BEEN SAYING MUCH THE SAME AS YOU JUST HEARD CHRIS EVANS SAYING NONE OF THE CAMERAS IT SAYS WERE POINTED AT THE ACTUAL MONUMENT ITSELF WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE I THINK WITH THE FOOTAGE WILL EVER GET USED ON THE SCREE TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
FORGIVE ME I'M MOVING ON IT'S PITCHED M. M. MACHINE REVERSES A MERE MORTAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VERSES THE REAL THING THE STAKES COULD HARDLY BE HIGHER JUST LISTEN TO HOW GOOD IT FEELS WHEN HUMANS DISCOVER THEY CAN STILL WIN
THAT WAS THE REACTION WHEN ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST PLAYERS HAVE THE ANCIENT GAME OF GO CAREERS LISI DULL FINALLY BEAT THE ALPHA GO COMPUTER PROGRAMME HAVING UNEXPECTEDLY LOST THREE MATCHES IN A ROW DENNIS A SAAB IS THE FOUNDER OF DEEP MINES THE COMPANY DEVELOPING THE COMPUTER PROGRAM ALPHA GO AND AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NEUROSCIENTIST I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM
WE'RE PRETTY SURPRISED TO HAVE WON THREE SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION ACTUALLY THE LOSS WAS VERY INFORMATIVE SO WE'VE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT THE BACK AT THE LOGS THIS MORNING
IT WAS BASICALLY DUE TO MISTER LEES BRILLIANCE HIS MOVE SEVENTY EIGHT WAS IT WAS VERY SHOCKING TO MANY OF THE PROFESSIONAL COMMENTATORS AND CERTAINLY TO ALPHA GO THE PROGRAMME
IT GAVE THAT MOVE LEFT A CHANCE OF LESS ONE IN LESS THAN ONE IN TEN THOUSAND OF THAT HAPPENING NOW THE GENIUS OF YOUR MACHINE WHICH AFTER ALL AS ONE THREE AND ONLY LOST ONE IS THAT IT'S SORT OF SELF TEACHING ISN'T IT THAT IT IT WORKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE HUMAN BRAIN AND EXPERIMENTING AND LEARNING FROM ITS MISTAKES
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S THE REAL INNOVATION I THINK OF ALPHA GO IS THAT IT BASICALLY GETS A LOT STRONGER
PLAYING MILLIONS OF GAMES AGAINST OLDER VERSIONS OF ITSELF AND LEARNING FROM ITS OWN MISTAKES AND INCREMENTALLY IMPROVING ITSELF SO THAT IT'S LESS LIKELY TO MAKE THOSE MISTAKES IN THE FUTURE SO THE ONLY WAY OF REALLY KNOWING
WHETHER THERE ARE ANY HOLES OR IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS IS TO PLAY AN EXTERNAL OPPONENT WHO OF COURSE IS EXTREMELY HIGH LEVEL AND VERY CREATIVE
LIKE LISA DOLL TO REALLY TEST ALPHA GOES KNOWLEDGE TO THE LIMIT AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY
HE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT ALPHA GO HAD NOT PREDICTED WHICH MEANS THAT IF ALPHA GO WAS PLAYING LISA DOLLS POSITION IT WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THAT
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN THE GAME HERSELF PLAY WHEN ALPHA GOES PLAYING ITSELF IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO LEARN FROM THAT MOVE AND LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES COS IT WILL NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE NOW IT'S EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE THIS TO BEAT A WORLD BEATING GO PLAYER BUT WHAT ARE THE WIDER APPLICATIONS HOW MIGHT WE SEE THIS SORT OF TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO SOMETHING LIKE THE N.H.S. FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW YOU'RE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AT THE MOMENT
YES SO THE APPLICATIONS THAT WE THINK ARE MANY FOLD THE REASON WE DEVELOPED ALPHA GO ALWAYS OF COURSE TO TEST OURSELVES IN THE GO ARENA BUT THAT WASN'T THEIR PRIMARY MOTIVATION
THAT WAS IT FOR US REALLY IS FOR US TO DEVELOP THESE GENERAL PURPOSE ALGORITHMS THAT UNDERLIE ALPHA GO AND ITS ABILITY AND THEN TRANSLATE THOSE ALGORITHMS TO OTHER DOMAINS REAL WORLD DOMAINS AND TO HAVE HUGE REAL WORLD IN
WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE ROBOTICS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE MAKING YOUR PHONE ASSISTANT
MUCH SMARTER AND MORE USEFUL I'M MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS THIS WOULD BE BECAUSE THEY COMPUTERS CAN GO THROUGH THE POSSIBLE DIAGNOSES OF A POSSIBLE SERIES OF OBSERVABLE SYMPTOMS MUCH FASTER AND MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVELY THAN ANY HUMAN
THAT'S RIGHT BUT YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS MORE LIKE A RESEARCH ASSISTANT DOING THE DRUDGERY OF GOING THROUGH ALL OF THOSE THAT DATA AND THOSE POSSIBILITIES AND THEN SURFACING THAT KNOWLEDGE IN A MORE USEFUL AND UNDERSTANDABLE AND MORE EFFICIENT WAY
FOR THEIR HUMAN DOCTORS AND NURSES AND CLINICIANS AND RESEARCHERS TO ULTIMATELY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT WHAT WE MIGHT THINK WOULD BE THE MOST HELPFUL WHICH IS A HOUSEHOLD ROBOT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS FOR ANYBODY DESIGNERS
THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF OF THE CHALLENGES OF A.I. IS THAT YOU KNOW WHY DON'T WE HAVE ROBOTS THAT CAN CLEAN UP OUR HOUSE AFTERWARDS AND STACK THE DISHWASHER
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ROBOTS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY CAPABLE OF DOING THAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THEY DON'T THIS KIND OF LEARNING A.I. HASN'T BEEN AVAILABLE SO UNTIL NOW MOST OF IT HAS BEEN OF THE KIND OF NARROW A.I. SORT WHERE THE TEAM ARE PROGRAMMERS PROGRAMME THIS SOLUTION DIRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IF ANYTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS OR CONTEXTUAL THE PROGRAMME HAS NO WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT IN A GRACEFUL WAY SO THAT'S REFERRED TO AS BRITS ONENESS US IN RESEARCH AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
YOUR HOUSE THE WAY YOUR HOUSE IS ARRANGED EVERYBODY'S HOUSE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND EVEN WITHIN YOUR OWN HOUSE THE STATE OF THAT HOUSE IN THE CLEANLINESS OF THE HOUSE IS DIFFERENT AND CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY SOME DAYS IT'S CLEAN SOME DAYS IT'S DIRTY AND THERE'S A LOT OF MESS
I KNOW A ROBOT THERE WAS GOING TO CLEAN UP YOUR HOUSE WOULD HAVE TO EFFORTLESSLY DEAL WITH ALL OF THOSE KIND OF INFINITE NUMBER POSSIBLE STATES THAT YOUR HOUSE CAN BE
SO THAT YOU CANNOT PRE PROGRAMMED THAT AT THE FACTORY YOU WOULD HAVE TO IT WOULD HAVE TO LEARN AND DEAL WITH THE SITUATION AS IT FINDS IT IN THAT MOMENT IN YOUR HOUSE AT THAT POINT WHEN IT'S ABOUT TO CLEAN
JUST ONE LAST ONE IF I COULD YOU'RE A LONDON BASED TEAM YOU LEARNT AT A LONDON UNIVERSITY WILL THE U.K. GOOGLY BOUGHT YOUR COMPANY END UP BENEFITING FROM HIS EXPERTISE I HOPE SO I MEAN ONE OF THE REASONS I SET UP THE MIND IN LONDON IS THAT I'M LONDON BORN AND BRED I'M VERY PROUD OF THE CITY I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING CITY ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD STUDIED AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON
SO I HAVE A LOT OF AFFINITY WITH THE AREA AND I JUST FELT THAT THERE'S SO MUCH TALENT OUR TOP UNIVERSITIES ARE PRODUCING THERE WAS NO REASON WHY A REALLY CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD IN A VERY IMPORTANT FIELD LIKE EH I COULDN'T COME OUT OF LONDON AND I THINK WE PROVED THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE WITH THE MIND DENNIS HAS A BISQUE THANKS FOR JOINING US
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT COMFORTABLE HE'S ROB THANKS JUST IN THERE HELLO AGAIN WHEN ARSENAL MANAGER HE WAS DESCRIBING IS A FAST THE SPECULATION ABOUT HIS FUTURE FOLLOWING THAT TOO ON HOME DEFEAT IN THE F.A. CUP SIXTH ROUND BY WATFORD AT NO QUESTION ABOUT THE MERIT OF WATFORD'S WIN BUT THE FOCUS FALLS ON VEGA AS ARSENAL SEASON UNRAVELS AND THREATENS TO FALL COMPLETELY FLAT WITH CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ELIMINATION THIS WEEK BY BARCELONA STILL FOR VEGA IT REMAINS BUSINESS AS USUAL
YOU KNOW ASKED WAS LOST JAMES IN HISTORY AND WE WAS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER AND COPE IF YOU DON'T PREPARE FOR THE NEXT ONE IS A COMPLETE BELIEF WATFORD WILL DISCOVER THEIR SEMI FINAL OPPONENTS THIS EVENING FOR A B. B. C. ONE TELEVISION AT ABOUT SEVEN TWENTY IN THE ONE SHOW THEY MIGHT BE PLAYING MANCHESTER UNITED OR WEST HAM WHO DREW ONE ALL YESTERDAY CRYSTAL PALACE AND EVERTON ARE ALSO INVOLVED
SCOTLAND TWENTY NINE FRANCE EIGHTEEN IN RUGBY UNION SIX NATIONS REGISTERED TO ACHIEVEMENTS YESTERDAY A SECOND SUCCESSIVE CHAMPIONSHIP WIN FOR SCOTLAND AFTER A BARON TWO YEAR RUN BUT ALSO THE CHAMPIONSHIP ITSELF TO ENGLAND WITH ONE GAME TO GO IT'S LEFT HER COACH EDDIE JONES ONLY PARTIALLY SATISFIED
THE MIXED TO BE HONEST IT'S OBVIOUSLY NICE TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP I THINK AS A TEAM WE FEEL WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THAT'S THE GRAND SWEAR WHEN I JAZZERS HAD TO REMIND PROP JOE MAHLER OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER MAHLER REFERRED TO WELL SAMSON THESE ROMANY HERITAGE AS THE TWO SQUARED UP DURING SATURDAY'S MATCH MAHLER HAS APOLOGISED BUT MAY YET BE SIGHTED AND MISS NEXT WEEKEND WHEN IT'S FRANCE FACES ENGLAND IN PARIS AND THE POSSIBILITY IS EDDIE JONES HAS MENTIONED
OF THE FIRST ENGLISH GRAND SLAM IT'LL BE THE FIRST IN THIRTEEN YEARS IN FACT TWELVE YEARS BEFORE THAT WELL WILL CARLING WAS LEADING AND TO THE FIRST OF THREE GRAND SLAMS UNDER HIS CAPTAINCY ON BODY WILL FINAL THERE'S NOW SO MUCH EXPECTATION AROUND THEY KNOW THAT FADED TO BE FRANCE WOULD BE A MASSIVE ANTICLIMAX WOULDN'T IT THAT'S A BIT OF PRESSURE I THINK YOU KNOW IT IS I SHOULD BE VERY VERNE THEY WANT COME HARD GAME I'LL BE TALKED ABOUT WOMEN WHICH IS QUITE RIGHT
NEVERTHELESS I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE GRAND SLAM WALES FOR LAST TO WIN IT FOUR YEARS AGO IN A IN A FICTION EST OF JUST FIVE MATCHES IT'S ALMOST THE ONLY HONOUR WORTH WINNING ISN'T IT
AND THAT WAS TO DO YOUR MINDSET IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WELL WE HAD A VERY GOOD TEAM SO I WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE BUT IT YEAH IT IS YOU NO I AIN'T LEAVING
VERY INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE THE FORMER FRENCH INTERNATIONAL THOMAS CUSTER SAID IF THEY KEEP THE SAME GROUP OF PLAYERS TOGETHER THEY CAN WIN THE TOURNAMENT FOR MANY YEARS YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT
AND
YES ONE WORD ANSWER THEN GRAND SLAM NEXT WEEKEND YES OR NO
OH WE'LL WILL CLOTTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND THAT TAKES US TO HER YES I HOPE FOR A RACING TIPS PLUMPTON FOR FORTY FIVE NUMBER TWO HEADS SPIN TAUNTON TO TWENTY NUMBER EIGHT OZZY THE OSCAR

OR FOR CANDID REASSESSMENT AND WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE CAN SACRED MEMORIES OF THE PAST DUE TO THE SOCIETIES THAT ARE BUILT ON THEM WE'RE JOINED THIS MORNING BY TWO HISTORIANS OF THE RISING RUTH DUDLEY EDWARDS AND DOCTOR HEATHER JAMES BY THE JOURNALIST DAVID REEF WHOSE BOOK IN PRAISE OF FORGETTING PUTS THE CASE FOR AN ETHICAL AMNESIA AND BY THE IRISH WRITER AND COLUMNIST FINTON O'TOOLE THE PAST IS WILDLY UNPREDICTABLE HE WROTE IN A RECENT PIECE ON THE RISING
JOIN US ON START THE WEEK TO FIND OUT WHAT SHAPE IT'S GOING TO TAKE JUST AFTER NINE THANKS TO TOM HANKS MOSTLY DRY AND SETTLED AS THE WEATHER PATCHY CLOUD SUNNY SPELLS
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON AND TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE SUSAN BRAY IS HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
THE TURKISH MILITARY SAYS IT'S WAR PLANES HAVE BOMBED KURDISH REBEL CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ THIS MORNING FOLLOWING A CAR BOMB ATTACK IN ANKARA YESTERDAY IN WHICH THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE DIED TWO OF THE DEAD ARE BELIEVED TO BE THE BOMBERS PRESIDENT EVERYONE HAS VOWED TO BRING TERRORISM TO ITS KNEES
AN ANTI IMMIGRATION PARTY HAS MADE BIG GAINS IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS IN GERMANY WHAT'S BEING SEEN AS A SHARP REBUKE BY VOTERS TO ANGLER MIRACLES OPEN DOOR POLICY FOR REFUGEES THE CHANCELLOR'S CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES AT THE HANDS OF THE ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND PARTY
THE MAYOR OF LONDON BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID ANY INTERVENTION IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD BE A PIECE OF OUTRAGEOUS AND EXORBITANT HYPOCRISY IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT MY OBAMA WILL VISIT LONDON NEXT MONTH AND URGE PEOPLE TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U.
THE GOVERNMENT ARE SETTING OUT PLANS FOR A SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW PAID TO SAVE MONEY PEOPLE RECEIVING UNIVERSAL CREDIT OF WORKING TAX CREDIT WILL BE GIVEN UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED POUNDS OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS IF THEY CAN SHOW THEY'VE INCREASED THEIR SAVINGS
SUSAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION IN GERMANY THE PARTY OF THE CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL OF COURSE HAS BEEN DEFEATED IN TWO OUT OF THREE STATES IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS ONE BIG GERMAN NEWSPAPER CALLED IT A WAKE UP CALL THIS MORNING IT'S BEING SEEN OF COURSE AS A REBUKE BY BOATERS FOR THE POLICY OF WELCOMING LARGE NUMBERS OF REFUGEES
THE F.T. PARTY WHICH IS SUGGESTED POLICE MAY HAVE TO SHOOT AT MIGRANTS TO STOP THEM ENTERING THE COUNTRY TOOK ONE IN EVERY FOUR VOTES IN ONE OF THE STATE'S CONTESTED ELECTIONS THE PARTY LEADER FRANKIE PETR EE SAID THAT THEIR SUCCESS WAS DOWN TO THE FLAWED POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT
THIS IS IT CAN I DO I'M TRYING TO PULL A CHICK IF I'M HONEST CLOSER THAN IT IS THE CATASTROPHIC POLICIES OF CHANCELLOR MADE A KILT WHICH CLEARLY OPENED PEOPLE'S EYES THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY WE SUCCEEDED IN ENTERING INTO ALL STATE PARLIAMENTS WITH DOUBLE DIGIT FIGURES IN SAXONY AND WEAVING BECAME INSTANTLY THE SECOND STRONGEST BART.
THAT WAS FRANK PETR EE TALKING AND JOIN IS ON THE LINE NOW THE LONDON CORRESPONDENT FOR THE GERMAN NEWSPAPER BUILT SEBASTIAN BALL GET TO YOU THIS IS NOT MERELY A WAKE UP CALL IT AN EARTHQUAKE IN GERMAN POLITICS
IT'S A PRETTY HEFTY YES I MEAN WE'VE HAD SIMILAR INSTANCES BEFORE WHERE RIGHT WING PARTIES AT GREAT DOUBLE DIGIT SUCCESSES AND PARDON NOT NOT NOT ON THE SCALE AND THE QUESTIONNAIRE SUPPOSES WHETHER THIS REPRESENTS A LIMIT A PROTEST VOTE AT A PARTICULAR TIME OR WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND HER PARTY BECOME MAJOR PLAYERS IN GERMAN POLITICS
VERY INTERESTING AND VERY OPEN QUESTION I MEAN HISTORY TELLS US THAT RIGHT WING MOVEMENTS AND PARTIES AND GERMANY HAVE RATHER SWORD SPRING AND THEN A LONG DECLINE FOGGY COMPLETELY OF COURSE IT'S YOUNG ENOUGH SHE'S ALWAYS SHE'S FEMALE WHICH IS STILL
WELL ADVANTAGE OBVIOUSLY SHE'S I THINK CLEVER ENOUGH MAYBE TRUE SUSTAINING THIS MOVEMENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HER IF YOU WOULD SO IT'S A DROPPER TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HER SHE LIKE ANGELA MERKEL IS A CHEMIST BY TRAINING LIKE ANGLE OF MERKEL SHE IS FROM THE EAST DOES THAT AFFECT HER ATTITUDES AND EVY
IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE HER COS SHE'S A VERY DIFFERENT GENERATION YOU KNOW SHE WAS BORN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MOTHER WHAT'S THAT WHEN THE WAR CAME DOWN SHE WAS FOURTEEN LOOK AT THEIR FAMILY IMMEDIATELY MOVED TO THE WEST
SHE HAD A GREAT
A SECONDARY EDUCATION SHE GOT A VERY PRESTIGIOUS SCHOLARSHIP FROM THE STATE SHE DID HER DEGREE IN READING
SHE STARTED IN AND GETTING IN UNIVERSITY WHICH IS STILL REGARDED AS ONE OF OUR BEST SO YOU KNOW SHE'S HAD ALL THE CHANTS AND STUFF A LOT
THAT GENERATION OF EASTERNERS HAVE SO THIS IS NOT A PROTEST IN SIMPLE ECONOMIC TERMS IN THE WAY ANTI MIGRATION FEELING IN THE U.K. OFTEN IS IS THIS A CULTURAL PHENOMENON SHE'S A WINNER LEADING A PARTY OF LOOS
I THINK THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING SHE IS SHE SHE IS HAVING HER POLITICAL CAREER IN THE EAST SHE'S A MEMBER OF
PARLIAMENT OF SAXONY AND OF COURSE THE PEOPLE WHO REMAINED IN THE EAST FEEL THAT THEY HAVE AND STILL FEEL TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER REUNIFICATION THAT THEY HAVE LOST OUT THERE'S GLOBALISATION IS AGAINST THEM THEY'RE NOT VERY KEEN ON FOREIGNERS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE EAST GERMANY WAS A VERY PAROCHIAL AND NATIONALIST STATE
VERY FEW FOREIGNERS LIVING UNDER UNDER ATROCIOUS CONDITIONS AND THE REASON THERE'S MATTERS NOW ALWAYS THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON ANGLER MERKEL'S OWN SENSE OF WHAT SHE HAS TO DEMAND THAT E.U. LEVEL IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS BUT OF COURSE CRUCIALLY HER REPLACEMENT THIS SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE AROUND FOR THAT MUCH LONGER
INTERESTINGLY OF COURSE BUT THE SAME ELECTIONS YESTERDAY BROUGHT A LOT OF THAT DEFEAT FOR ONE OFF THE WOMEN WHO WERE
MEANT OR WERE TALKED ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS YULIA CLOCK NOT IN LIKE PALLETS AND THEY'D HAVE TO SAY IT'S PARADOXICAL I KNOW BUT MACKEREL IN HER OWN PARTY LOOKS MORE SECURE THIS MORNING
THEN SHE DID YESTERDAY MORNING BECAUSE THE ABSENCE OF A COMPETITOR VERY VERY INTERESTING SEBASTIAN MORGAN THANK YOU JOIN US THE TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE WE WERE TALKING A WEEK AGO ABOUT THE ROMANTICALLY NAMED TRACE GAS ORBITER WHICH IS THE CRAFT THAT BLASTS OFF TODAY TO GO TO MARS AND TELL US ONCE AND FOR ALL WHETHER
WAS WHAT HIS LIFE THERE DOCTOR MANNISH PATEL IS ON THE LINE SENIOR LECTURER IN PLANETARY SCIENCES AT THE OPEN UNIVERSITY AND CO LEAD ON THEM NOMAD INSTRUMENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS ON BOARD THE TRACE GAS OR BITTER ANY DRUGS ON THE LINE FROM DARMSTADT WHERE THE EUROPEAN SIDE OF MISSION IS BEING CONTROLLED FROM GOOD MORNING TO YOU
TELL US FIRST OF ALL WHAT YOUR BIT OF KIT DOES
SO A BIT OF KIT IS CALLED THE NOMAD SPECTROMETER IT LOOKS AT THE SUNLIGHT COMING FROM THE SUN LOOKS THROUGH THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE BY DOING THIS WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS MADE OF AND THAT IS REALLY KEY TO THE WHOLE THING ISN'T THERE BECAUSE THERE IS METHANE THERE AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE
YES EXACTLY MEET METHANE METHANE WAS DETECTED NOT PEOPLE CLAIM DETECTION ABOUT A DECADE AGO AND IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL MEASUREMENT
IT WASN'T AS A FIRM IS IT THERE IS IT REALLY THERE OR NOT SO WE DESIGNED THIS MISSION TO GO THERE AND FIND OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL WHETHER HE'S THERE OR NOT I THINK YES I'D MISUNDERSTOOD I THOUGHT THERE WAS METHANE AND YOUR MISSION WAS GOING TO FIND OUT WHY IT WAS THERE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ESTABLISH FIRST THAT THERE REALLY IS METHANE THERE'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT IT WE GOT A BETTER IDEA THAN IT WAS METHANE THERE WITH THE CURIOSITY MISSION WHERE THEY
FIRST DIDN'T DETECT IT AND THEN SUDDENLY DEAD SO I GAVE US A BIG BOOST BUT WE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT FOR SURE WE ARE SEEING WHAT WE'RE SAYING AND IF THERE IS METHANE IS THEIR LIFE
I LIKE THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION POSSIBLY
PLANT ON EARTH METHANE IS A GAS THAT IS LINKED TO LIFE IT'S A BIOGENIC PRODUCED GAS
IS IT THE CASE ON MARS WE DON'T KNOW THAT YEAH THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS SOME SOME EXCITING LIKE LIFE SOME
POSSIBLY LESS EXCITING GEOLOGICALLY THIS STUFF CAN BE MADE BELOW THE SURFACE MAY BE SEEKING OUT THREE THAT POO THAT MAGNUS AND THEN AT A LATER STAGE YOU WILL DISCOVER WHETHER THAT IS THE CASE WHEN YOU BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS CRAFT LANDS DOESN'T IT EVENTUALLY AND THEN ANOTHER CRAFT GOES THERE AND DOES THAT DRILLING WORK
YES EXACTLY THAT'S THE SECOND PHASE A MISSION CALLED THE X. I WAS ROVER THAT'S NOT GONNA BE LOOKING AT METHANE PER SE PASCOE COULD BE TAKING SAMPLES FROM BELOW THE SURFACE AND ANALYSING THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS LOOK AT THE METHANE MAP WHERE IT'S COMING FROM SEE HOW CHANGES IN TIME ON A DAILY BASIS ON A SEASONAL BASIS AND FROM THAT TRY AND FIGURE OUT
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM WHAT THE SAUCES ARE BIG GETS US CLOSER THERE DOESN'T IT I MEAN THAT QUESTION IS THERE LIFE ON MARS WHICH GOODNESS WE'VE BEEN ASKING
NOT JUST DAVID BY OTHERS AS WELL ASKING FOR A LONG TIME DID GET A ARE YOU REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT ONCE THESE MISSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF YEARS AT LEAST TO GO HAVEN'T WE WILL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO STAY PRETTY DEFINITELY WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN LIFE ON
SIX ARE COMPLICATED PUZZLE WHAT AT WHAT IS DIFFICULT TO DO IS DESIGN EXPERIMENT THAT WOULD JUST MEASURE THE PRESENCE OF LIFE OR NOT WHAT IT WHAT IT IS IT'S A JIGSAW
MYSTERY IN RIDDLES TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT VERY VERY SUBTLE INDICATIONS OF PAST LIFE SO WHAT THE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE CLUES TO LIFE ON MARS THE ECZEMA WAS MISSION AS A WHOLE WILL HOPEFULLY SOLVE
BY LOOKING AT MARS AT A GLOBAL LEVEL WITH THE ORBITER AND GOING DOWN AND THE ROVER AND REALLY REALLY DRILLING DOWN LITERALLY INTO THE SURFACE AND TRYING TO ANSWER THAT QUEST
DOCTOR MANAGED PATEL GOOD LUCK TODAY WITH THE TAKE OFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AS MOURNING FROM DUNSTER IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN REPORTING A LOT ON THAT BOMB ATTACK IN ANKARA IN TURKEY THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION JUST COME THROUGH ON REUTERS NEWS AGENCY EVIDENCE IS SUGGESTING THAT THE BOMBER IN ANKARA AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WAS A FEMALE P.K.K. REMEMBER P.K.K. OF COURSE IS THE NAME FOR KURDISTAN WORKERS PARTY SO THERE WAS SOME
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THIS WOULD PROVE TO BE LINKED TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUPIES ALI SOLL DIE ASH OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE THE KURDS AND PEEK O.K. THE EVIDENCE ACCORDING TO SECURITY SOURCES TALKING TO REUTERS IS THAT IT IS THE P.K.K.
NOW MORE SAD NEWS ABOUT TERRORISM I'M AFRAID WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PEACEFUL FAMILY DAY ON THE BEACH TURN FOR MANY INTO A DAY OF FEAR AND HORROR AND BLOODSHED THE BEECHING QUESTION THE WEST AFRICAN STATE OF THE IVORY COAST WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY CHARLENE BURTON A BELGIAN WHO WAS HAVING LUNCH ON THE BEACH YESTERDAY AND GRAMPA SAM AND ALSO BY THE DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES AT THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE ROUGH LOU PAN TO CHI A GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING

UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES APPEAR TO BE BECOMING SOMETHING OF A PATTERN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD I MEAN WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS NOW IN REGIONAL CAPITALS EAR KNOW OUAGADOUGOU BOOKING A FUSS AND IN MALI IN BAMAKO WHERE WE'VE HAD GROUPS AFFILIATED OR LINKED TO THIS SORT OF A SUBGROUP OF ARCADE IN THE ISLAMIC MARGARET THE LOCAL AFFILIATE LAUNCHING THESE ATTACKS ON SOFT TARGETS INDISCRIMINATELY SHOOTING AT TOURISTS AS THEY SORT OF GO ABOUT THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS
AND IT DOES SEEM TO BECOMING A DEPRESSINGLY REGULAR FEATURE OF THE REPORTING FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND THERE IS A TEMPTATION ALWAYS TO SEE THIS IS PART OF SOME INTERNATIONAL TERROR CAMPAIGN IN TRUTH OF THESE NOT LOCALISED TERROR GROUPS WHO THEN AFFILIATES TAKE THE NAME OF A GROUP LIKE A CARD I THINK IT'S A MIX IN A WAY I MEAN YOU'RE LOOKING ULTIMATELY AT THIS PARTICULAR ORGANISATION AT ONE THAT ALWAYS A SPOUT HAS ALWAYS ESPOUSED A MORE INTERNATIONALIST RHETORIC FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE IT'S
SERVES A NUMBER OF PURPOSES TO STRIKE HER TARGET LIKE THIS ON THE ONE HAND TO THE SORT OF THE PRESENCE OF WESTERNERS WERE PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION AND SORT OF RAISE YOUR CAUSE UP HE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY WHICH WAS SORT OF DAMAGE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT WILL SORT OF ADVANCE YOUR COURSE AND THEN IT DOES ADVANCE THAT IDEOLOGICAL MESSAGE OF TRYING TO STRIKE THE EVIL FAR ENEMY OF THE WEST WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF SORT OF A KITE IS
EAT THIS STATED INTENTIONS SURELY NOT FOR YOU FOR YOUR FAMILY THE FALL THE HORROR OF YESTERDAY DID YOU THINK ON BALANCE THAT THE IVORY COAST WAS STILL A PLACE YOU COULD SAFELY BRING UP YOUR FAMILY NO I AM YEAH IT DON'T I DO IT'S GREAT IT'S A VERY GOOD FAMILY WE KNEW THAT WHAT'S GOING ON UNLIKELY FLOWER BED AT ANY TIME SOON ARE YOU GOING UP OR DUCK A P.

IN ANOTHER IF YOU'LL BE REACHING FOR NOW OF COURSE WE ARE WE CAN'T BE DIPPING NOT LIVING LOVAGE LOMBARD BIT ODD LIKE KYLE IT IS CAN WE JUST CAN'T CONTINUE LIVING AT IT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE AND IT DOESN'T APPLY ONLY PLEASE CAN I KEEP UP IF HE'S A PIG EVERYBODY BECAUSE CURD POUCHES IT'S SPAD BLANCA EAT ANYBODY WHO PAID YOU FOR THE HAPPILY FOIL VETERAN WHERE CELT BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE BOOK AND PEOPLE KILL JAW WHEN I CALLING AND PEOPLE SO
YOUR PLAN IS TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY I WAS IN THE COUNTRY YOU COS NO YARD PET LUING SUMMER
KNOWING SOMETHING AND EXPERIENCING IT YOURSELF AND THE HORROR THAT AS A PARENT YOU HAVE OF THINKING HOW YOU LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILD ARE OBVIOUSLY TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS YEAH I WOULD YEAH ADULTERY AND I DON'T
THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE CHARLENE BURTON THANK YOU AND REF ELLO AND TWO CHI OF THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE THANK YOU AS WELL THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE HOW MUCH FINANCIAL ADVICE SHOULD WE ALL GET DO WE GET TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE IS IT HAVE A DECENT QUALITY HAS BEEN A BIG REVIEW TAKING PLACE INTO ALL OF THIS AND MATTHEW IS HERE NOW WITH WHAT THE RESULTS MATTHEW OR C.D.O.S THE RESULTS YET NO IT CAME OUT ON THE RESULT ADVICE ON FINANCIAL ADVICE LET'S TRY AND GET SOME IT IS OUT NOW
THE BIG QUESTIONS WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WITH YOUR PENSION SHOULD YOU RE MORTGAGE YOUR HOUSE WHAT ABOUT THOSE SAVINGS IF YOU'VE GOT THEM UNTIL TODAY REMARKABLY HARD TO FIND OUT AN EASY AND CHEAP ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS NICK HUNGERFORD YOU'RE THE SEA
FOR THE INVESTMENT FOR NUTMEG YOU WERE ON THE ADVISORY PANEL OF EXPERTS FOR THIS REVIEW AND WHY IS IT BEEN SO DIFFICULT FOR ORDINARY INDIVIDUALS TO GET ANSWERS TO THOSE PRETTY FAIRLY SIMPLE QUESTIONS YET YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE FINANCIAL ADVICE HAS BEEN REGULATED AND PERCEIVED TO BE REGULATED BY THOSE ADVISORS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS ONLY SERVED VERY VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'S SO COMPLICATED
TO GIVE ADVICE AND TAKES SO MUCH TIME THAT ONLY THE WEALTHY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY FOR IT SO THIS REVIEW BY THE FINANCIAL WATCHDOG AND THE TREASURY INTO FINANCIAL ADVICE I MEAN YOU'RE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT YOU THINK THIS IS A REVOLUTION I THINK IT'S A HUGE CHANGE FOR THE INDUSTRY IT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THE EXCUSES THAT INDUSTRY PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN GIVING FOR NOT PROVIDING ADVICE AND I THINK IT OPENS UP THE DOORS TO A FORMATION OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF COMMUNICATING TO CUSTOMERS ABOUT THEIR FINANCES
WHICH WILL ENABLE PEOPLE TO GET HELP AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAUGHT MY IDEA ROBO ADVISERS THIS IDEA THAT YOU ESSENTIALLY GO IN ONLINE YOU FILL IN YOUR DETAILS AND IT TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AND LUCRATIVE IN THE STATES FOR THOSE COMPANIES GIVING ADVICE BUT I MEAN THAT WILL SCARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WEREN'T AT THAT YOU JUST TAKE A FEW BOXES IN THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO IT MIGHT SCARE A FEW PEOPLE BUT ACTUALLY MOST PEOPLE FEEL FAR MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO A COMPUTER THAN A HUMAN MORE PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO LIE
IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER COS THEY FEEL THERE'S NO NEED TO BOTH STALLS AT ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO IT DOES WORK IT DOES WORK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY IS TO DEVELOP THE THE DECISION TREES TO DEVELOP THE PATHWAYS THAT WE CAN GIVE ACCURATE ADVICE TO PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT THE BEST WE CAN DO ONLINE AND YET COMPANIES LIKE NUTMEG WORK VERY HARD TO DO THIS IS GIVE SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME OR VICE ON ONE SUBJECT
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO GET THE FULL SPECTRUM OF VICE SO WE CAN GUIDE PEOPLE TO DO AS HE SAID WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR PENSION WAS BEST FOR THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR MORTGAGE AND PRESUMABLY ONE OF THE BIG FACTORS IN THIS HAS BEEN SOME OF THE MIS SELLING SCANDALS P.P.I. ON THE LIKE WHICH WE SHOULDN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY JUST DON'T THEY DON'T TRUST THEIR HIGH STREET BANKS TOOK TO GIVE THEM INDEPENDENT ADVICE THAT THEY PRESUMED THAT THE BANKS AND THE ADVISERS ARE TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF THEM YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE IS
CAN CAN COMPLETE LACK OF TRUST IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AT THE MOMENT AND WE NEED TO WORK REALLY HARD TO RESTORE THAT TRUST AND WHETHER HIS P.P.I. OR WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE SAYING I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DECISION THE MOMENT THERE'S BEEN MADE WE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT AND SO THESE NEW RULES THAT ARE COMING IN OR PROPOSED RULES THAT ARE COMING IN
GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CUSTOMER TO ACTUALLY LOOK THROUGH AND SEE WHAT ADVICE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THEM AND ON WHAT SPECIFIC ISSUES IT WILL BE GIVEN AND THE REGULATOR HAS BEEN VERY FIRM AND SAYING THERE WILL BE NO LONG STOP FOR PEOPLE YOU YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISERS WILL HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ADVICE O.K. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD NEWS LET'S SEE F.A. IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN BE IT DOES INDEED HELP PEOPLE NICK HUNGERFORD FROM NOT MAKE THANKS VERY MUCH
SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MATTHEW GEORGE OSBORNE HAS WARMED THE U.K. HAS TO ACT NOW RATHER THAN PAY LATER AHEAD OF NEXT WEEK'S BUDGET HE SAID THAT NEW CUTS WOULD BE NEEDED THE EQUIVALENT HE SAID OF JUST FIFTY P. IN EVERY HUNDRED POUNDS HER PUBLIC SPENDING BY THE END OF THE DECADE DOESN'T SAY MUCH DOES IT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE OF THE F. T.
IT IS TALKING OF CUTS OF FOUR BILLION POUNDS A YEAR WHICH SOUNDS RATHER MORE SO WILL THE AGE OF AUSTERITY NEVER END RESORT THIS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS PART OF THE PRE E.U. REFERENDUM SABRE RATTLING TO DISCUSS THAT WE'RE JOINED BY FRASER NELSON EDITOR OF THE SPECTATORS IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO AND WITH ME HERE NOW JENNY RUSSELL COLUMNIST FOR THE TIMES ON THE TIMES AND THE EVENING STANDARD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING FRASER IS THIS ECONOMICS POLITICS
AS EVER WITH GEORGE OSBORNE THAT'S POLITICS FIRST ECONOMY HASN'T CHANGED MUCH IN THE LAST YEAR BUT HIS LANGUAGE'S CHANGED COMPLETELY THIS TIME LAST YEAR THERE WAS A GENERAL ELECTION COMING HEADS IT WAS ALL OPTIMISM AND SUNSHINE NOW WAS REFERENDUM COMING ALONG SO IT SITS IN FOR US TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FEARFUL THAN SEE LOTS MORE DARK CLOUDS WHIZZING THROUGH THE SKY LIFE HAS GOT A BIT TOUGHER FOR IN THERE WASN'T IT THE CHINESE ECONOMY SLOW DOWN THERE'S WORRIES IN THE EUROZONE AND INDEED THE NUMBERS ON TAX TAKE FOR THE CHANCE FOR A LOT LESS GOOD THAN HE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN TOLD
YES THINGS ARE A BIT LESS GOOD THAT THE SEVEN BILLION POUNDS AS QUITE A SOUNDS A SCARY FIGURE BUT THIS IS LESS THAN ONE PER CENT OF HIS TAX HALL SO HAVING ATTACKS AS ONE PERCENT LESS THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE IS A HEADACHE BUT IT'S NOT A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN OUTLOOK SO I THINK THE ECONOMIC HYPE IS BEING EXAGGERATED WASN'T BOUNCING FOR HIM IF HE'S GOING TO MISSUS M. DEBT TARGETS NOW SWINGS TO COVER UP THIS EMBARRASSMENT BY SOME SPIN UPPER JENNY YOU SAID A SPIN OR USE IT AS A PROPER ECONOMIC PROBLEM
I THINK THE REST PROPER PROBLEM THERE'S NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THE CONSERVATIVES THOUGHT THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE IN A FAR BETTER STATE AT THIS POINT THAT IT ISN'T GEORGE OSBORNE HAS FAILED TO CUT THE DEFICIT IN ANYTHING LIKE THE WAY HE EXPECTED SO HE HAS GOT A GENUINE PROBLEM THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS SLOW AND PRODUCTIVITY IS LOW AND A LOT OF THE NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN IN LOW WAGE LOW PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH WHICH MEANS THAT HE HASN'T GOT
THE TAX RECEIPTS THAT HE WAS EXPECTING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND OF COURSE HE DOES HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH THIS WITH THIS BUDGET IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PRE ELECTION BUDGET ISN'T AT ALL WHAT YOU'D EXPECT AT THIS TIME IN A PARLIAMENT HE HAS GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTRY IS SUFFICIENTLY CONFIDENT ABOUT
HIS AND DAVID CAMERON'S GOVERNANCE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME THE NEED TO CONSTANTLY REVISE HIS NUMBER'S ON BORROWING RAISES TWO POSSIBILITIES JEDI THERE DOESN'T IT AYE HE'S A MONUMENTAL FAILURE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT OR IS JUST A SENSIBLE PRAGMATIST RESPONDS TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES TWITCHES HIS POLICY HERE AND THERE A LITTLE BIT EACH TIME
OR YOU COULD ARGUE THAT HE PLACES FAR TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE ON PROJECTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIS FINANCES FAR INTO THE FUTURE A LOT OF CRITICS INCLUDING ME SAID AT THE TIME AT THAT COMPLAINS ARE SPENDING REVIEW THAT TO SUDDENLY DECIDE THAT BECAUSE THAT OBI ART SO HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FEW BILLION EXTRA IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT HE COULD RELAX HE'S SPENDING TARGETS WAS SIMPLY NONSENSE IT'S LIKE SHOOTING AN ARROW ABOUT FIFTY MILES AND HOPING IT'LL LAND ON A PARTICULAR ROCK THOUGH HE'S HE'S MUCH TOO
INTERESTED AND MICRO MANAGING BUT AT THIS POINT HIS MAIN CONCERN IS SIMPLY PRESENTING A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T ALIENATE THE POPULATION THE NEXT TORY M.P.S THINK HE'S A GREAT FUTURE LEADER AND MAKE SURE THAT ENOUGH PEOPLE WILL VOTE TO STAY IN THE REFERENDUM ON THE SUBSTANCE YOU HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME CRITIC OF HIS FAILURE TO DELIVER ON PROPER CUTS AS YOU SEE THEM IN PUBLIC SPENDING THE DEFICIT AND INDEED DEBT
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THIS FUNNY THAT'S DENIS HEALEY MANAGED TO CUT IN ONE YEAR MORE THAN GEORGE OSBORNE'S MANAGED TO CUT IN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS HE'S BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD PEELING A PLASTER OFF SLOWLY TO MINIMISE THE PAIN AND IT'S TAKING THEM SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS TO DO WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LOT EARLIER
AND FOR EXAMPLE ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO MY AUTUMN STATEMENTS HE DECIDED TO GO FOR SLOWER AND CUTS THE HE THOUGHT BUT THEN HE SHOULD HAVE DONE AND HE'S FOREVER PAYING THE PRICE HE ALWAYS WANTS TO TAKE HER RIGHT TO THE LIMIT SO WHEN YOU TO MILES CHANGING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW IT MEANS HE'S GOT TO
HE'S GOT TO MISSUS TARGETS ARE HE DOES WANT PHYSICAL SANITY BUT JUST NOT YET THE REASON FOR THAT JENNY IS OUR OLD FRIEND POLITICS THAT WAS A NECK WHICH IS TORY M.P.S ARE ALWAYS SAYING LET'S MAKE A STEAK SMALLER LET'S CUT SPENDING CUT ANYTHING IN SPECIFICALLY AND MAYOR SQUEALING AND WITH A VERY SMALL PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY GEORGE OSBORNE FINDS WHETHER IT'S ON TAX CREDITS OR ANOTHER IS SHE'S HE CAN'T GET HIS POLICY THROUGH
THAT'S RIGHT JUST AT THE MOMENT HE WANTED TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES TO THEIR PENSIONS SCHEMES BUT THAT WOULD HAVE HIT THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS ISN'T SO HE'S PULLED BACK FROM THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE ELECTRICALLY UNPOPULAR IN THE SAME WAY HE WAS GOING TO MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN COUNCIL HOUSING AND EARNING MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND SUDDENLY PAY THE FULL MARKET RATE FOR THEIR RENTS THAT WOULD'VE HIT ALL THE ASPIRING HARDWORKING FAMILIES THAT THE TORIES ARE TRYING TO REACH SO HE'S PULLED BACK FROM THAT AS WELL NOW WE HEAR THAT ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH HE COULD MAKE UP THIS GAP IS TO FINALLY PUT A PENNY
BACK ON THE FUEL TAXES THAT WE PAY AT THE PUMPS AND YET THAT'S ELECTORALLY UNPOPULAR WITH THE CONSERVATIVES TOO SO WHATEVER HE DOES HE'S GOING TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING THAT MINIMISES HIS GENERAL UNPOPULARITY AND MAKES THE BUDGET LOOK GOOD NOT ONLY ON THE DAY WHICH HAS ALWAYS MATTERED TO HIM BUT IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME
WHICH HAS MATTER TIM LES BECAUSE HE CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE A POLITICAL MISTAKE THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST POLITICAL BUDGET WE'VE EVER SEEN BECAUSE BEFORE HE HAD AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE CUT COALITION WOULD WIN AGAIN HE'S NOT HALF SO SURE THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO WIN AND THAT HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS THERE ANYTHING YOU THINK FRASER YOU CAN DO TO KIND OF RESCUE HER DREAM OF REPLACING DAVID CAMERON AS OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER
PLENTY IT'S THREE YEARS AWAY WHICH IS AN ETERNITY IN POLITICS I DON'T THINK YOU'LL ONLY IF ONLY IF THE COUNTRY VOTED TO REMAIN A COOK AT ALL THAT'S GOT TO GET UP EVEREST LEAVE IT IT'S GAME OVER FOR DAVID CAMERON GAME MOVEABLE GEORGE OSBORNE AND WILL BE HAVING NUMBER TEN CHRISTMAS CONCEN BORIS JOHNSON THAT'S RIGHT FRASER AND THE REST OF US HANG OUT
WE WILL WE WILL SEE YOU I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS BUT YOU EVEN PEWTER MEMBERS IN TWO YEARS' TIME A VISION OF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN GEORGE HAS GOT A LONG TIME TO KISS AND MAKE UP FOR THIS PARTY SO HE SIMPLY HAS TO HOLD HIS NERVE AND LOOK COMPETENCE JENNY IN THE FACE OF AN OPPONENT WHO IS DOMINATING THE HEADLINES AND IS FOR THE MOMENT LOVED BY THE PARTY ACT IN SPACE
YES BUT POSSIBLY NOT QUITE SO LOVED BY THE REST OF THE NATION AND OSBORNE HE'S VERY GOOD AT LOOKING CAPABLE AND CONFIDENT NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING WRONG WITH HIS ECONOMIC FORECASTS IT'S WHETHER THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY VANDALISED WHAT HE'S DONE IS EQUALLY CONFIDENT THAT'S HIS ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JENNY RUSSELL THERE AT THE TIME SUNSHINE DEALING CENTRE FRASER NELSON AT THE SPECTATOR I THINK THAT'S JUST ABOUT IT FROM US AFTER THE HEADLINES TOM SUTCLIFFE WILL BE HERE TO START THE WEEK EDITORS WERE JOHN MOORES BANK KELLY
