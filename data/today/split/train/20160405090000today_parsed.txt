THAT SAID THERE WILL BE A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE DAY ONE AREA FAVOURED FOR SEEING SOME OF THESE IS JUST INLAND FROM THE COAST EFFECTS ENCOUNTERS OF DORSET HAMPSHIRE AND WEST SUSSEX YOU COULD SEE HER NOT SHARP SHOWER HERE DEVELOPING BUT IT WILL BE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON THAT WE SEE THOSE SHOWERS CERTAINLY NOT THROUGH THE MORNING TIME

CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THERE ARE SOME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE HEADLINES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY ACROSS MOST OF THE NEWSPAPERS THIS AFTER THE PANAMA OR PAPERS REVEAL DETAILS OF THE OFFSHORE TAX ARRANGEMENTS OF HIS LATE FATHER IAN CAMERON THE BULK OF THE DETAIL AS IN THE GUARDIAN WHICH HAD ACCESS TO THE PAD IN THE PAPERS THE GUARDIAN'S ESTABLISHED THAT HE AND CAMERON RAN AN OFFSHORE FUND WHICH AVOIDED PAYING TAX IN BRITAIN
BY HIRING A SMALL ARMY OF THE HARM AS RESIDENTS INCLUDING A PART TIME BISHOP TO SIGN IT'S PAPERWORK FOR THE KEY QUESTION FOR THE PRIME MINISTER NOW IS PUT ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR SO DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY MONEY STASHED IN A SECRET OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN PRIME MINISTER A DOWNING STREET HAS INSISTED THAT THIS IS A PRIVATE MATTER BUT ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES AND THE DAILY MAIL CAMERON DRAGGED INTO TAX HAVENS
IT IS ON MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES TELEGRAPH THOUGH HAS HAS IT ON ITS FRONT PAGE KAMEN TIGHT LIPPED OVER OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL STORY THEIR MAIN STORY IS AS A RESULT OF A POLL THAT THEY'VE CARRIED OUT ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION A REFERENDUM SUGGESTING IN ITS HEADLINE PROJECT FEAR IS WORKING BECAUSE THE TELEGRAPH THEIR POLL SUGGESTS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THOSE WHO WOULD VOTE TO STAY IN THE E.U. ARE GAINING GROUND
BEGINNING TO WIN THE ARGUMENT AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM ACCORDING TO THE PAPER THEY SAY DESPITE CONCERNS AT THE STILL CRISIS IN THE BRUSSELS TERROR ATTACKS COULD INFLUENCE THE RESULT THE POLL SUGGEST THEY'VE HAD LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON HOW PEOPLE VOTE SO LINTON CROSBY WHO MASTERMINDED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY GENERAL ELECTION VICTORY IS WRITING IN THE PAPER AND ANALYSE IT AND SAID BASICALLY ALL COMES DOWN TO TURN OUT WHICH SIDE CAN PERSUADE THEIR SUPPORTERS TO TURN OUT BECAUSE IT FINDS THAT
WHEN YOU CERTAINTY DEVOTE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE CAMPAIGNS ARE VIRTUALLY TIED WITH BOTH ON FORTY NINE PERCENT IT'S ALL DOWN THERE ON THOSE WHO ARE YET SAID WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE
THE TIME NOW IS TEN PAST SIX M.P.S ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HAVE CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT FOUGHT DOWNPLAYING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS JAMES ROBBINS IS A DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT JAMES THEY'RE NOT CRITICISING THE ACTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT JUST THE WORDS OF THOSE AT THE TOP
THAT'S RIGHT THEY'RE QUITE CAREFUL IN THIS REPORT THE M.P.S UNDER THEIR CONSERVATIVE CHAIRMAN BUT THEY DO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AT LEAST LEFT THE IMPRESSION
BUT IT IS DOWNGRADED HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE THE MOST SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE TOLD THE COMMITTEE AND EVIDENCE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS WAS NOT ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES AND THAT THE PROSPERITY AGENDA WAS FURTHER UP THE LIST
THE M.P.S ON THE COMMITTEE WERE PARTICULARLY CRITICAL OF REMARKS BY THE JUNIOR MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST TO BUY IF ELWOOD HE APPARENTLY TOLD THE COMMITTEE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHETHER OR NOT HE'D RAISED HUMAN RIGHTS DURING A VISIT TO EGYPT WITH A BUSINESS DELEGATION WERE DISAPPOINTED THEY SAID BY THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDERSECRETARY HIS CHOICE OF LANGUAGE ON THIS OCCASION RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ENERGETICALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS RAISING HUMAN RIGHTS ABOUT GOES TO THE HEART OF IT I THINK IT'S IT'S A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT PERCEPTION
AND THE IDEA THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS TAKEN HOLD IN MANY CIRCLES PARTICULARLY AMONG HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANISATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PURSUING TRADE AT THE EXPENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS THIS DESPITE WHAT THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY DOING AND FUNDING THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY HAS APPARENTLY REJECTED THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DOUBLED
ITS FUNDING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECTS ABROAD TO OVER TEN MILLION POUNDS AND HE SAYS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CORE TO THE WORK OF ALL OUR DIPLOMATS EVERY DAY THAT THEY SERVE ABROAD AROUND THE WORLD HE DOESN'T RECOGNISE THE CHARACTERISATION IN THIS REPORT OF BRITAIN'S HUMAN RIGHTS WORK
WELL WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE CRISPIN BLUNT IN AN HOUR'S TIME JAMES ROBBINS THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS AND OTHER STAFF TAKING LONG TERM SICK LEAVE HAS GONE UP BY A THIRD IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE DATE HAS COME FROM A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST BY THE B.B.C. TO WHICH FORTY FORCES IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND RESPONDED A REPORTER MARK HUTCHINS HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE FIGURES AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS MARK WHAT WE MEAN BY LONG TERM SICKLY IT DEFINED BY THEIR FORCES
TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OR TWENTY NINE DAYS OR MORE AND THESE FIGURES ARE QUITE STRIKING IN THAT THEY SHOW A MARKED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS AND STAFF TAKING SICKLY FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS WE ASKED ALL FORTY SIX U.K. FORCES FOR INFORMATION WE GOT FULL DATA BACK FROM FORTY OF THEM ACROSS ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND THERE WE DIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION BACK FROM POLICE SCOTLAND AND THE PICTURE THAT EMERGED
IS THAT DESPITE THE NUMBERS OF WORKERS EMPLOYED SHRINKING THE TALLY OF CASES OF LONG TERM SICKNESS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS WENT UP FROM FOUR AND A HALF HOURS AND IN TWENTY TEN TO SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS ALSO A STEADY INCREASE IN OVERALL LONG TERM SICKNESS LEAVE AND OVER A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD PREPARING
TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WITH FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AT THE BIGGEST INCREASE WAS IN WEST YORKSHIRE BUT BY FORTY FOUR PERCENT WHAT A BY NORTH WALES WITH FORTY PERCENT BUT BIGGEST DECREASE WAS SEVENTEEN PERCENT IN WARWICKSHIRE BUT BUT OVERALL AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THESE FORTY OR FORTY SIX GENERALLY THE TREND WAS UP WAS IT OR WHETHER CERTAIN FORCES WHERE THE FIGURES WERE SUCH THAT THE
OVERALL PICTURE IS IS AFFECTED THE OVERALL PICTURE IS UP THERE ARE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THAT FORCES COLLECT SOME OF THE DATA BUT THE PATTERN THAT EMERGES IS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES WE'VE HAD A RESPONSE FROM THE POLICE FEDERATION WHICH REPRESENTS FRONT LINE OFFICERS THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT SURPRISED BY THE FINDINGS THEY CLAIM THAT CUTS TO STAFFING LEVELS INCREASE IN CRIME
LED TO OVERSTRETCHED AND OVERWORK SERVICES THEY CALL IT A PERFECT STORM OF HARD PRACTISED HARD PRESSED OFFICERS IN HIGHLY STRESSFUL SITUATIONS SUFFERING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THERE'S ALSO RESPONSE FORM FROM THE MINISTER FOR POLICING
PENNING WHO SAYS A POLICING BY ITS NATURE IS STRESSFUL AND DEMANDING IT'S THE JOB OF CHIEF OFFICERS TO ENSURE THAT POLICE OFFICERS AND STAFF ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR WORK AND THE GOVERNMENT SAY THEY'VE ALLOCATED MORE CASH TO HELP THAT LIKE BED BUT THIS THIS THIS LINK BETWEEN THE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL OF THE STAFF AND THE AMOUNT OF CUTS THAT THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING
IS THAT BACKED UP IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA OF WHICH FORCES HAVE MORE SICK LEAVE COMPARED TO HER WHICH HAVE HAD TO CUT THE MOST I DON'T THINK THE DATA GOES INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY DATE FOCUSES ON THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS AND STAFF WHO HAVE BEEN ON LONG TERM SICK EITHER IN GENERAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS IT WOULD NEED MORE DIGGING TO BACK UP THAT CLAIM FROM THE POLICE FEDERATION THAT CUTS ARE PART OF THAT BUT ALSO THEY SAY IT'S NOT JUST FUNDING WITH A NUMBER OF OFFICERS DOWN IN THE EXTRA PRESSURES THAT THEY'RE UNDER
I'LL CATCH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX DAY TWO OF THE BIGGEST LEAK OF INFORMATION EVER WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR BUSINESSES AND THEIR REPUTATIONS JO LINE AND HAS NEWS ON THAT YEAH GOOD MORNING TO YOU SERIOUS QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT THE MURKY WORLD IN WHICH SOME POTENTATES COMPANIES AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS INHABIT LAST NIGHT WE LEARNED THAT THE PANAMANIAN LEGAL FIRM MUST LIKE FONSECA
WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH FIRMS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS THE LEAK APPEARS ALSO TO SHOW THE LATEST B. C. BANK PROVIDED FINANCIAL SERVICES TO BARRY THE TWO IS A LAWYER WITH PINSENT MASON'S YOU'RE HEAD OF CORPORATE CRIME BARRY THAT'S RIGHT AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS WHOLE LEEK IN THE FACT THAT IT'S A BROTHER A LAWYER
HER BROTHER LAWYER I THINK IT'S THE FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S THE NEW NOW THIS IS A MASSIVE DATA LEAK THERE'S LOT OF TALK ABOUT SECRECY BUT YOU CAN'T COUNT SECRECY CAN NO LONGER BE GUARANTEED WHEN THE SORTS OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WITHIN A WEEK THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE DATA ALONG THESE LINES AND WHAT DOES THAT SAY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE DAYS OF EXPECTING AND DEMANDING SECRECY FROM YOUR LAWYERS ARE OVER
NOT I DON'T THINK THAT THE DAYS OF DEMANDING SECRECY FROM YOUR LAWYER OVER ITS BASIC CORNERSTONE AND THE FACT THAT FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF ENGLISH LAW IN LAW THE WORLD OVER BUT I DO THINK THAT THE IDEA THAT THINGS CAN BE WILL BE KEPT UNDER WRAPS FOREVER CANNOT BE GUARANTEED WHEN YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE HACKING GOING ON THESE MASSIVE DATA DUMPS HAPPENING
DO YOU THINK THE PRINCIPLE OF SQUIRRELING MONEY INTO UNNAMED ON NUMBERED COMPANIES AND BANK ACCOUNTS OVERSEAS IS WRONG FOR A LAWYER TO FACILITATE
I THINK YOU NEED TO DRAW A VERY BIG DISTINCTION BETWEEN ILLEGAL CONDUCT AND PERFECTLY LEGAL CONDUCT IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE OVER SIMPLIFICATION AND ICE OF GLOBAL WORLD WITH MONEY FLOWS HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY DAY IN DAY OUT OF WHICH FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF LONDON IS A MAJOR FINANCIAL HUB
THAT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE YES BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE OF AGGRESSIVE TAX EVASION AVOIDANCE OBVIOUSLY EVASION IS ILLEGAL AND IF SOMEONE COMES TO A LAWYER AND THEY MAY BE UNDER SANCTIONS LIST WHAT SHOULD THAT LAWYER DO
WELL I THINK IF SOMEBODY'S ON A SANCTIONS LIST THE ANSWER SHOULD BE PRETTY CLAIRE YOU SHOULD BE PUT IT IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT BEEN CLEAR MARSEILLES BASICALLY ACCEPTED THEIR BUSINESS AND GET OPENED AN ACCOUNT FOR THEM WELL I THINK BASED ON THE STORIES THAT I'VE SEEN I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S QUITE AS CRYSTAL CLEAR AS I THINK YOU HAVE A PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH RULES PERHAPS CHANGE OR DUE DILIGENCE
HE'S CONDUCTED PERHAPS THE DUE DILIGENCE WAS THAT WAS DONE WAS INCOMPLETE WHO KNOWS THERE SEEMS TO BE THE STORY THAT HAS BEEN PRINTED I NOTED THAT THEY WITHDREW ACTING FOR SOME OF THESE COMPANIES LONG BEFORE THE STORY BROKE AFTER A FEW YEARS WHEN THEY WERE MADE AWARE THAT SOMEONE AS ON SANCTIONS LIST
BUT MY POINT IS IF THEY WEREN'T AWARE THEY WERE ON THE SAME AS THIS WHEN THEY START IT HAD THEN THEY HAD NO AWARENESS OF THAT BUT I BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO PICK UP THIS POINT ABOUT ILLEGALITY AND EVASION AND AVOID EVASION IS ILLEGAL EVASION IS ILLEGAL AVOIDANCE IS NOT GOING IF SOMEBODY HAS A PROBLEM WITH AVOIDANCE I PERFUME WAY OF REDUCING THEIR TAX LIABILITY FOR EXAMPLE AND ICE WILL BE A VERY PROSAIC EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULDN'T ANSWER YOU'RE NOT COMPARING ICES TOMB HAVING OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS IN PANAMA
I'M NOT WELL I'M NOT COME BUT WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT TAX EVASION TAX AVOIDANCE IS SIMPLY THE PUNTERS LEGAL AND ONE IS NOT ILLEGAL IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AVOIDANCE AND IT'S FOR GOVERNMENT TO CLOSE DOWN THE LOOPHOLE IF IT EXISTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT SWITCHES FROM BEING AN AVOIDANCE SCHEME OR PLAN TO AN EVASION THING AND ILLEGAL OH KAY WHO SHOULD BE LAWYERING UP
I THINK TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND THEY ARE NOT UNFAIRLY TARRED WITH THE BRUSH WITH THE CLAIM THAT ALL SECRECY IS LEGAL WHICH PLAINLY IS NOT THAT I THINK AND I DO I WOULD SAY THIS WOULDN'T YOU LOOK EVERYBODY SHOULD GET HIRED HOWEVER IF YOU ARE A CLIENT OF MY CYCLE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM IN IN THE PAST YOU SHOULD BE CONSULTING SOMETHING I'M GUESSING
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED YOU WENT TO A LAWYER YOU EXPECTED AND YOU HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT CONFIDENTIALITY AND IT APPEARS THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE BREACH OF THAT CONFIDENTIALITY WITH A HUGE LOSS OF DATA O.K. BUT IF YOU'RE TOO THEY'RE FROM SOME ESSENCE THANKS FOR JOINING US LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE LATEST IN THE SEARCH FOR A BUYER FOR TO STEAL A TATTER SAYS IT WANTS TO HAVE A DEAL WITHIN WEEKS OR IT WILL HAVE TO WALK AWAY FROM STEEL MAKING IN THE U.K.
THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAID YOU JAVID TWEETED LAST NIGHT THEIR PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TODAY HE WILL MEET THE TRADE UNIONS MEANWHILE THE INDIAN BUSINESSMEN SCENT YOU'VE GOT TO HEAD OF THE LIBERTY GROUP HAS TOLD B. B. C. THAT HE HAS HAD VERY ENCOURAGING TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND HAS RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING OVER PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS WITHOUT HUGE JOB LOSSES AND MICHELLE WILL BE SPEAKING TO HIM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WITH ME NOW IS GARETH STAYS THE DIRECTOR OF U.K. STEAL GOOD MORNING TO YOU GARETH MORNING JAM
WHERE YOU WERE ENCOURAGED BY MY DOCTOR'S STATEMENTS YESTERDAY I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY ANY INVESTOR COMING FORWARD AND SHOW AN INTEREST IN TATTERS STEEL BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY THE WHOLE A WHOLE BUSINESS AS A WHOLE THERE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
THE STEEL CRISIS DIDN'T START LAST TUESDAY EVEN LAST OCTOBER I DESCRIBED THE STEEL SECTOR SECTORS A PATIENT BLEEDING ON THE OPERATING TABLE AND THAT WITHOUT LIFESAVING SURGERY IT WOULD DIE SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER
JOB JOB LOSSES BLOOD LOSSES YOU COULD SAY IN THE STEEL SET FROM THE PATIENT IS NOT YET STABILISED AND HE'S STILL ON LIFE SUPPORT AND THEREFORE GOVERNMENT MUST NOW GET THE DEFIBRILLATOR OUT AND GIVE THE SECTOR OF WHAT'S NEEDED SHOCK AND BRING IT BACK FROM DEATH'S DOOR AND GIVE IT A HEALTHY FUTURE ONE OF THE MEDICS EXAMINING THE PATIENT IS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SICHER JAB JAVID DOES HE HAVE YOUR FULL CONFIDENCE
SUCH A JAVID AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAVE BOTH SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO HELP THE STEEL SET AND I'M GOING TO HOLD THEM TO THAT BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH THAT THEY NEED TO STILL DO THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION THAT'S VERY WELCOME BUT THERE'S MORE SIGNIFICANT ACTION TO TAKE BECAUSE MANY COMPANIES THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT TATTERED THIS IS THE WHOLE SECTOR MANY COMPANIES ARE TELLING ME TODAY
THEY DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THEIR BUSINESS FROM SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN WE HELD CRISIS TALKS WITH THE BUSINESS SECRETARY O.K. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BUYERS SUPPOSEDLY INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS WE KNOW THE GREY BALL IS TALKING ABOUT THE THE SCUNTHORPE PLANNED AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET SOME NEWS ON THAT TOMORROW OR YESTERDAY WE WERE SPEAKING TO ALEXANDER ABOUT IT FROM BEAR IN BERKELEY SAID THE RUSSIANS AND BRAZILIAN STEEL MAKERS MAY BE INTERESTED
WHAT D'YOU MAKE OF THAT THAT'S ALL GOOD NEWS THAT THE MORE INVESTORS THE BETTER AND THEN IT'S FOR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THAT ACTION TO ENSURE THAT
AN INVESTOR LOOKS AT THE BUSINESS SERIOUSLY AND LOOKS AT IT FOR THE LONG TERM THAT'S WHAT WE NEED SO LET'S NOT JOB DONE WHEN WE SEE INVESTORS COMING IN SO WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED HE'S STILL FOR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STEEL SECTOR IN THE U.K. IS A PLACE THAT INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS WANT TO INVEST IN AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND EVEN NOW IS THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WHAT ABOUT NATIONALISATION THE WELSH GOVERNMENT SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE LONDON GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER NATIONALISATION AT LEAST IN THE INTERIM
WELL WE WOULD SAY THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE A TIME LIMITED LIFE SUPPORT TO THE TATTERED BUSINESS TO THE SECTOR AND THEN TO ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE TO PROVIDE ANY POTENTIAL BUYER THE REASON TO INVEST SO IT'S IT'S TIME LIMITED BUT THAT THAT SUPPORT MAINE MAY BE NEEDED ALSO FROM
FIRST TIME OF INTEREST OF AN INVESTOR TO THE ACTUAL WHEN THE DEALER'S DONE COS WE MUST REMEMBER IF WE LOOK AT TATA STEEL'S LONG PRODUCT DIVISION SCUNTHORPE OPERATIONS THAT DEAL HAS SO FAR TAKEN TWO YEARS TO GET TO THE END OF IT AND WE'RE STILL NOT AT THE END OF IT I'D LIKE TO THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET AN ANNOUNCEMENT FAIRLY SOON ON THAT BUT WAS STILL NOT AT THE END OF THAT DEAL JUST FINAL THOUGHT IF THESE SCUNTHORPE DEALER TAKES YEARS TO NEGOTIATE
AT PORT TALBOT EVEN BIGGER IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN MORE BECAUSE THE THE INVESTORS SANJIV SAYS HE ONLY WANTS A FINISHED PRODUCT I'VE GOT A FURTHER DOWN THE LINE POLICY DOES IS NOT ANCIENT ACTUALLY MAKING STEEL IN THE BIG SLAB FORM EXACTLY AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WHY WE NEED DIRECT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OR GET THE LIFESAVING SUPPORT THERE FOR THAT
BIG YOU STATED RULES NO I THINK EVEN WITH STATE AID RULES I THINK WE'RE IN THE CITIES WHEN THE REAL DEEP CRISIS HERE AND IF THAT MEANS GOVERNMENT PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF STATE AID RULES OR EVEN GO BEYOND THEM THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD DO IT AND SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES LATER BECAUSE THE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW
NOT LATER GARETH STAYS THERE THE DIRECTOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND JANE SAID THEM IS OUR MARKETS GUESS FROM RATHBONE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU JANE MORNING CAN WE START WITH THE POUND IT'S SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AGAINST THE EURO IT'S ONE EURO TWENTY FIVE THAT MIGHT HAVE A TH IMPACT ON PETROL AND FILLING UP A CAR AS WELL
YES YES I MEAN IF STERLING DEVALUES OIL IS PRICED AND DOLLARS SO CLEARLY IT WOULD INCREASE COSTS BUT WE GO GOING TO PROBABLY SEE QUITE A LOT OF VOLATILITY IN STIRLING AHEAD OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM PARTICULARLY THESE WE GET THE FEEDBACK FROM THE POLES AND THE BOOKMAKERS AND SO ON AND IF IT GETS VERY TIGHT AS WE GET CLOSER TO JUNE TWENTY THREE
WORKING YOU SEE THE POUND VERSES THE DOLLAR OR THE URUK COULD HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S QUITE A LONG TWENTY IT'S QUITE LIKELY IT WOULD WEAKEN FURTHER ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE CLEARLY THE UNCERTAINTY GROWS AND IT IS ALL ABOUT UNCERTAINTY AT THE MOMENT ARE OUR ESTIMATE IN THE GENERAL CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT IF WE WERE TO BRECK SETS YOU'D SEE STERLING FALL BY AROUND FIFTEEN PER CENT
SO SO THAT'S NOT AN INCONSIDERATE MAN FOR FOR A MAJOR CURRENCY ABSOLUTE IT TODAY'S THE LAST DAY FOR BUY TO LET INVESTORS TO GET TO COMPLETE THEIR HOUSE PURCHASES BEFORE STAMP DUTY RATES GO UP FOR THEM FROM TOMORROW IT'S BEEN A HUGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AHEAD OF THIS OF COURSE AND IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT THE MARKET COULD GO FAIRLY QUIET
IN THE SHORT TERM NOT LEAST ACTUALLY AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM SOMETIMES THAT UNCERTAINTY CAN PUT PEOPLE OFF COMPLETING TRANSACTIONS AND TAKING RISKS ESSENTIALLY SO YOU THINK IN THE SECOND QUARTER THAT WE'VE JUST STARTED COULD BE VERY QUIET FOR A HAS PURCHASES FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS COULD WELL BE TIME TO GO ON HOLIDAY FOR ESTATE AGENTS HAVE THE ALL OF THAT THE I.M.F. THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND WARNED YESTERDAY OF A BLOOD BATH ON MARKETS IF CHINA DOESN'T HAVE A SOFT LANDING
THEY DIDN'T MINCE THEIR WORDS THEY DIDN'T I MEAN I THINK IT IS IT'S OF IT'S FAIR THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS QUITE SERIOUSLY AND ALTHOUGH I THINK WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOCUSED ON YOU AT THE REFERENDUM IN THE U.S. ELECTIONS AND SO ON IN REALITY CHINA MATTERS HUGELY THE GROWTH RATE MOST ECONOMISTS WOULD ESTIMATED SOMEWHERE ARE LIKELY TO BE SOMEWHERE AROUND SORT OF THREE TO FIVE PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO THE SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT THAT THEY SEEM TO HAVE EXACTLY IF IT WERE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT AND THEN I THINK THERE WOULD BE
CONCERNS NOT LEAST BECAUSE OVER THE WEAKNESS OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY AND OBVIOUSLY IF YOU SAW A DEVALUATION OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SLOWING THAT WOULD HAVE SEVERE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD ALREADY OBVIOUSLY WE'VE ALL BEEN AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY FALLS IN ENERGY COSTS AND COMMODITY PRICES AND SO ON

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF SAVING THE PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE BUSINESS SECRETARY HOLD A SERIES OF MEETINGS TODAY WE'RE JOINED BY NORMAN SMITH OR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR AND DOES IT LOOK TO YOU NORMAN AS IF THEY MIGHT GET SOMEWHERE TO A SOLUTION WITHIN A TIGHT TIMEFRAME BEFORE TO DECIDE TO ACTUALLY SHUT THE PLANT DOWN
I THINK ONE THING IS CLEAR THEY ARE UNDER NO ILLUSIONS THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO MOVE SWIFTLY BECAUSE TATA OFFICIALS MADE BOTH MY RABBIT AND THE UNIONS COMPLETELY AWARE YESTERDAY THAT THEY WERE STICKING TO THE VERY TIGHT TIMETABLE OF A FEW WEEK WHICH IS WHY WE'RE NOW SAYING THIS FRENETIC ACTIVITY
IN GOVERNMENT WITH SUCH A JAVID MEETING ONE POTENTIAL BUYER SONS YOU'VE TO HAVE LIBERTY HOUSE THIS MORNING AND THEN MEETING THE UNIONS THEN FLYING TO MUMBAI NOW PART OF THAT OBVIOUSLY I THINK HIS PRESENTATIONAL TO COUNTER
THE IMPRESSION HE HAD THAT HIS INITIAL RESPONSE WAS BORDERING ON THE LETHARGIC BUT IT IS ALSO BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE CLOCK IS TICKING THERE SIMPLY IS NO CHANCE I THINK OF DRAGGING THIS OUT FOR MONTHS BECAUSE TARTARE WANTED WANTED DONE AND DUSTED WITHIN WEEKS WHICH OF COURSE GIVES ENORMOUS LEVERAGE TO MY GUPTA WHEN HE BEGINS NEGOTIATIONS TODAY AND WHAT
ADDS TO HIS LEVERAGE IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT HE IS AT THE MOMENT THE ONLY CONFIRMED BUYER SO HE HAS A LOT OF CARDS IN HIS HANDS WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO HIM JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK AS FAR AS THE PRIME MINISTER IS CONCERNED THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE A MUCH MORE PERSONAL ISSUE DRAPED ACROSS THE FRONT PAGES THIS MORNING RELATING TO HIS LATE FATHER'S
A TAX ARRANGEMENTS BUT BUT INCLUDING AT A CONTEMPORARY QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT THE CAMERON FAMILY'S TAX ARRANGEMENTS TODAY WERE NUMBER TEN ARE PRETTY MUCH PUSHING BACK
ANY COMMENT ON THIS SAYING THAT THE STORY ABOUT HIS FATHER IS AN ORAL STORY AND IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER IN TERMS OF THE CAMERON FAMILY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY DO NOT OWN ANY SHARES IN ANY COMPANY IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS NO INVOLVEMENT ENTANGLEMENT OR WHATEVER
WITH TAX HAVENS OR OFFSHORE FUNDS MORE BROADLY THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THE GOVERNMENT'S RECORD ON TACKLING TAX AVOIDANCE AND TAX EVASION SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY TO TRY AND CRACK DOWN ON TAX AVOIDANCE AND TAX EVASION TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH MEASURES FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY
A BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES RAISING THE ISSUE AT INTERNATIONAL SUMMITS ESTABLISHING A REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP AND THEY SAY THERE HAVE BEEN SOMETHING LIKE FORTY DIFFERENT CHANGES TO TAX RULE SINCE THE BUDGET BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THERE IS PRESSURE
AND JEREMY CORBIN TODAY WILL SEEK TO COMPOUND THAT BY SUGGESTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN EFFECT PAID LIP SERVICE TO CRACKING DOWN ON TAX ABUSE AND THAT THE USE OF THESE TAX HAVENS HE WILL ARGUE HE'S STARVING PUBLIC SERVICES OF MONEY SO WHAT STARTED OUT AS IF YOU LIKE IS A LEEK SCANDAL IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY A POLITICAL ISSUES WELL NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN WELL THAT MASSIVE LEGAL PAPERS FROM MON SAC VON SECKER THE LEGAL FIRM OR PAT PALOMA SHOWS ALSO THAT IT HAD CLIENTS WHO WERE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS THIRTY THREE OF THEM WERE AT SOME POINT FACING ACTION BY THE U.S. TREASURY SIMON COX IS OUR INVESTIGATIONS REPORTER AND HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ASPECT OF THIS HUGE ALL THIS DATA LEAK THAT WE'VE HAD AND FOUND WHAT'S ON
SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLES ON THIS SANCTIONS ISSUED THE FIRST IS TO DO WITH NORTH KOREA WAS A COMPANY THAT MOST LIKE VON SECKER SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALL D.C. BE FINANCE IT WAS LINKED TO A BANK HAD THE SAME INITIALS
AND THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE WAS A NUCLEAR TEST BY NORTH KOREA AT THE U.S. THEN PLAY SANCTIONS ON THE COUNTRY MOST FONSECA DIDN'T TAKE ANY ACTION UNTIL FOUR YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHEN THEY WERE CONTACTED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THEY THEN CUT TIES TO THE COMPANIES YOU THINK ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT THEN A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER
THE COMPANY D. C. B. FINANCE AND THE BANK WAS SANCTIONED BY THE U.S. TREASURY THE FINANCE COMPANY FOR SUPPORTING THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BANK
FOR ACTUALLY HELPING TO FUND THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND IN THOSE SANCTIONS THEY SAY THAT THE RAISING OF FUNDS FOR THE REGIME HAPPENED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN THIS COMPANY WAS SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND SICK SO NOT REALISING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED TO NORTH KOREA
I HAD BIG IMPLICATIONS LATER ON RIGHT AND SYRIA'S RICHARD BIST RICHEST BUSINESSMEN ALSO INVOLVED WITH THIS COMPANY
SERIES RICH HIS BUSINESS IS VERY INTERESTING SO HE'S A GUY CALLED RAM EMA CLUE FOR ART HE ALSO WAS SUBJECT TO U.S. SANCTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MOST LIKE VON SECKER HAD SIX COMPANIES WITH HIM WHICH THEY REALISED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY THEN CONTACTED HIS BANK AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY INTERESTING ON THIS HIS BANK WAS H.S.B.C.
WHICH WE DID KNOW ABOUT BEFORE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE STILL HIS BANK WHILE HE WAS SUBJECT TO U.S. SANCTIONS AND THE CONVERSATION THAT MOST VON SECKER HAVE WITH H.S.B.C. IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE ACCORDING TO MOST FONSECA THEY CONTACTS H.S.B.C. IN GENEVA AND THEY SAY THEY ARE COMFORTABLE
WITH A CLUE THAT THEN LEADS MOST FRANTIC TO SAY O.K. WELL IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WE'LL DO BUSINESS WITH HIM AS WELL WHAT ARE THEY AND H.S.B.C. SAYING NOW ABOUT IT SO MOST VON SECKER SAY THEY NEVER KNOWINGLY ALLOWED THE USE OF THEIR COMPANIES BUY ANY INDIVIDUALS IN SYRIA
OR IN NORTH KOREA H.S.B.C. SAID THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORITIES TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME AND IMPLEMENT SANCTIONS BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE LOTS OF QUESTIONS OVER THE SANCTIONS ISSUE CERTAINLY STAIN MIX COMING DAYS SIMON COX THANKS VERY MUCH
AMONG THOSE WHO FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN UNWELCOME SPOTLIGHT AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE PALOMA PAPERS OFF FRIENDS OF PRESIDENT PUTIN ALLEGED TO BE ENGAGED IN OFFSHORE SCHEMES AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN OR SHARIF WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM MOSCOW BY OUR CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG AND FROM KARACHI BY OUR CORRESPONDENT CHARLES G. LONNIE SHOWS A WHAT HE'S EMERGED ABOUT MISTER SHARIF AND HIS FAMILY AND HAS BEEN RECEIVED
AND IT IS NOT SORRY OFFSHORE COMPANY WHICH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE PRIME MINISTER WERE TREE OFFERS FOUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN NAMED HIS HIS SON OF OURS SINCE YESTERDAY'S BEEN ON LOCAL T.V. CHANNELS DOGAN COMEDIA DENYING ANY WRONGDOING
SO THAT THE FOCUS IN PAKISTAN AT THE MOMENT THE OPPOSITION POLITICIAN IMRAN KHAN HE'S ALREADY CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION THE GOVERNMENT HAVE GONE INTO AN OVERDRIVE SAYING THAT THESE COMPANIES EXISTED THEY HAVE BOUGHT PROPERTIES IN LONDON BUT THEY HAVEN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS AND IN TERMS OF THE THE OVERSEAS WEALTH OF
OF THE RULING ELITE THAT THIS THIS POINTS TO DOES THAT COME AS A SURPRISE TO PEOPLE IN PAKISTAN I MEAN IT IS A COUNTRY WITH A VERY SMALL TAX BASE AND INCLUDING THE FACT THAT LOTS OF POLITICIANS DON'T PAY TAX THAT'S RIGHT LESS THAN ELEVEN PERCENT DAX STOOD YOU DIPPY RACIAL BUGS DON'T HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD BUT BUT MOST PAKISTANIS AREN'T ENTIRELY SURPRISED THEY KNOW THEIR POLITICIANS ARE CROCS THEY'RE SEEN AS GREEDY AVOID BEING TAXED
THIS DASH AWAY THEIR BILLIONS OF STOLEN FROM THE COUNTRY INTO SAFE HAVENS ABROAD ALL DEAD OR SORT OF WIDELY ACCEPTED AND MOST PEOPLE DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER THESE REVOLUTIONS WOULD LEAD ANYWHERE AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST ABOUT NAMING AND SHAMING THE POLITICIANS THAT'S TEN THEN TO STEVE ROSENBERG IN MOSCOW WHAT ALL THE ACCUSATIONS AS FAR AS THOSE WITHIN PRESIDENT PUTIN CIRCLE ARE CONCERNED
WELL THE THE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE'S SOME KIND OF MONEY LAUNDERING RING INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN BUT THE KREMLIN HAD BORN A WEEK AGO THAT SOME INFORMATION ATTACK HAS IT CALLED IT WAS BEING PLANNED ON RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN SO SO THE CRIMMINS REACTION YESTERDAY WHEN IT CAME I THINK WAS AS TO BE EXPECTED WE HEARD FROM
PUTIN SPOKESMAN DIMITRI PESCH OFF WHO SAID THE INVESTIGATION WAS FULL OF INSINUATION SPECULATION NOTHING CONCRETE NOTHING NEW ABOUT PRESIDENT PUTIN AND HE SAID THAT THE MAIN TARGETS OF THE THE PANAMA PAPERS WERE PRESIDENT PUTIN AND RUSSIA'S POLITICAL STABILITY IN THE RUN UP TO PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS THIS AUTUMN AND THEN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN A COUPLE OF YEARS' TIME
AND HE ACCUSED THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OF BEING BEHIND THIS C.I.A. OFFICIALS TALK HE TALKED ABOUT THE DEGREE OF PUTIN A PHOBIA ABROAD HAVING REACHED SUCH A DEGREE THAT NO ONE WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING GOOD ABOUT RUSSIA SO COMING OUT STORMING BUT THE INTERESTING THING WAS I THINK THAT THE STATE CONTROL T.B. CHANNELS THE THREE MAIN T.V. CHANNELS IN RUSSIA
COMPLETELY IGNORE THE STORY FOR MOST OF YESTERDAY IT WAS IF IT JUST WASN'T HAPPENING AND ONLY BY THE THE NIGHTLY NEWS THE EVENING BULLETINS DID THEY DID THEY START TO MENTION RIGHT SO THE RESPONSE FROM THE KREMLIN AIMED MOSTLY AT AT INTERNATIONAL CONSUMPTION OR GIVEN THAT THE DELAY IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA COVERING IT
YEAH ABSOLUTELY CERTAINLY ON IT DOMESTICALLY THE STORY HAS BEEN BRUSHED ASIDE
THE MAIN BULLETINS DID REPORT THE STORY YESTERDAY BUT IT WASN'T HEADLINE NEWS ON ONE OF THE CHANNELS YOU HAD TO WAIT THIRTY FIVE MINUTES ACTUALLY I DO A FIFTY MINUTE BULLETIN FOR A REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION AND WHEN IT CAME THE THE REPORTER SAID IT HAD NO FOUNDATION IT FOLLOWED THE KREMLIN LINE SAYING THAT THE PANAMA PEEPERS READY ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT RUSSIA AND I THINK
THAT IS NOW DONE AND DUSTED AS FAR AS RUSSIAN STATE TELEVISION IS CONCERNED DO YOU THINK FOR PAKISTAN ALSO THIS IS DONE AND DUSTED AND THIS IS A HUGE LEAP OF MATERIAL AND PEOPLE BE PORING OVER IT FOR SOME TIME TO CALM BUT IF THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A SURPRISE A VALUE IN IN A COUNTRY LIKE PAKISTAN THAT LIMITS ITS IMPACT
THAT'S RIGHT BUT I THINK POLITICIANS TRIED TO CAPITALISE ON THIS ESPECIALLY OPPOSITION POLITICIANS LIKE HIM ROUND YESTERDAY HE HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE IT GOD FOR THE PRIME MINISTER ONCE AGAIN TO RESIGN FOR INVESTIGATION HE'S MEETING HIS BUGGY AGAIN TODAY SO THIS WILL LINGO ON I MEAN IN BUCK MEDIA IT'S A VIBRANT DISCUSSION IT WILL GO ON FOR A FEW DAYS I THINK SO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AMID THAT MASS OF MATERIAL IN THE PAN AM A PAPER'S EDITORS HAVE LARGELY HOMED IN ON ONE FACT DAVID CAMERON'S LATE FATHER RAN AN OFFSHORE FUND WHICH AVOIDED PAYING ANY TAX IN BRITAIN FOR THIRTY YEARS THEIR STORY IS THE LEAD IN THE GUARDIAN THE TIMES THE DAILY MIRROR THE METRO AND THE DAILY MAIL
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ALL ENTIRELY LEGAL AND HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT SINCE TWENTY TWELVE BUT AS A MALE POINT OUT THE PALOMA PAPERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEW DETAILS WHICH ARE ESPECIALLY EMBARRASSING BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER SPOKEN OUT REPEATEDLY AGAINST TAX AVOIDANCE AND IS HOSTING A SUMMIT ON THE ISSUE NEXT MONTH DOWNING STREET'S INSISTENCE THAT THE CAMERON FAMILY FINANCES ARE A PRIVATE MATTER GETS SHORT SHRIFT FROM THE DAILY MIRROR IT'S FRONT PAGE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH THE QUESTION SO DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY MONEY STASHED IN A SECRET OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN PRIME MINISTER
THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH THE RESULTS OF ITS LATEST POLL ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH HAS THE REMAIN CAMP ON FIFTY ONE PER CENT A SEVEN POINT LEAD OVER THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE QUESTIONED BY ORB THE POLLING COMPANY PROJECT FEAR IS WORKING SAYS THE HEADLINE IN THE TELEGRAPH THE PRIME MINISTER ARGUES THAT A BRITISH EXIT WOULD BE AN ACT OF SELF HARM IN THAT'S CARTOON HE MAN IS TELLING A POSTER I'M WIDE THERE LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD MAKE THE ARCHERS MORE VIOLENT
HE SENDS IN THE HEAVY MOB TO DEPORT JUST TWO HUNDRED MIGRANTS AS THE MALES DESCRIPTION OF THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRST GROUP TO BE RETURNED FROM GREECE TO TURKEY UNDER A NEW DEAL THE ACCOMPANYING PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS MIGRANTS HEMMED IN BY BORDER GUARDS WEARING SURGICAL MASKS ON A BOAT LEAVING LESS BOSS THE MAIL SAYS THE MAJORITY OF THE MIGRANTS WERE PAKISTANIS WHO HAD NOT CLAIMED ASYLUM AND SO WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT BACK EVEN WITHOUT THE NEW ARRANGEMENT AND FINALLY A NUMBER OF PAPERS PICK UP ON RESEARCH BY PSYCHOLOGISTS SUGGESTING THE MAGICIANS IN PARTICULAR SHOULD HEED THE OLD SHOWBIZ ADAGE
NEVER WORK WITH CHILDREN THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPOT A SLEIGHT OF HAND THE TELEGRAPH EXPLAINS BECAUSE THEY DON'T RELAX THEIR ATTENTION IN THE SAME WAY AS ADULTS WHO BLINK MORE HAS THEY LOSE CONCENTRATION ALLOWING THE MAGICIAN TO PULL OFF A TRICK WHILE THEIR EYES MOMENTARILY
OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THE LABOUR LEADER IS URGING THE PRIME MINISTER TO DO MORE TO TACKLE AGGRESSIVE TAX AVOIDANCE AFTER THE LEAK OF MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS SHOWING THE EXTENT OF THE PRACTICE IF YOU ARE A BUILDING DEVELOP THEN THREE OF THE WORST WORDS AN OFFICIAL CAN SAY TO YOU A GREAT CRESTED NEWTS
THE PROTECTED ANIMALS STOP EVEN THE LARGEST DEVELOPMENT IN ITS TRACKS THEY MUST BE TRACKED DOWN AND RELOCATED IT'S EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE RULES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUILDING WORK TO CARRY ON WHILE NOT AFFECTING THE OVERALL CONSERVATION STATUS OF THE CREATURES AND IT APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND CAUTIOUSLY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THINGS NEED TO CHANGE A CONSULTATION ON THE PLANS RUN BY NATURAL ENGLAND WILL END THIS WEEK PLAY MARSHALL REPORTS
WHAT DO YOU SEE THIS LEAF HERE
IT'S FOLDED OVER LIKE A LITTLE SORT OF CONCERTINAED LEAF AND EACH FOLD HARBOURS AN EGG
JOHN DIXON RUNS THE REPTILE AND AMPHIBIAN GROUP IN SOMERSET HE'S SEARCHING FOR NEWT IN HIS GARDEN POND IF YOU TURN THEM OVER
THEY'RE QUITE STRONG VERY VERY ORANGE WITH SORT OF BLACK SPOT THE BLACK SPOTS OR INDIVIDUAL TO EACH ANIMAL A LOVING H. I THINK THEY'RE FASCINATING THINGS
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY ANCIENT ABOUT THEM HE STAYED BACK THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION YEARS BUT ACROSS EUROPE NUMBERS OF THE GREAT CRESTED NEWT DECLINED ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE PUT ON THE LIST OF EUROPEAN PROTECTED SPECIES IF EVEN A SMALL NUMBER ARE FOUND ON A SITE IT TRIGGERS A PROCESS THAT CAUSES EXPENSE AND DELAYS
I'M THE FAIRY KING SENIOR ECOLOGICAL CONSULTANT AT YOU COS YOU'RE LESS AND A GREAT CRESTED NEWT LICENCE SURVEYOR SO THIS IS A NEW FENCE THAT'S QUITE FULL IT'S JUST ATTENTION LOVELY PLASTIC AND IT GETS PUT DUG INTO THE
HOW DO YOU SURVEY FOR EGGS SEARCHING WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING IN THE LEAVES FOR EGGS TORCH SEARCHES IN THE EVENING AND ALSO BOTTLE TRAPPINGS OR RELIEVE TRAPS OUT IN THE POND AT NIGHT AND COLLECT THEM THE NEXT MORNING PAUL THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE BETWEEN MID APRIL AND OCTOBER WHEN THE GREAT CRESTED NEWTS ARE ACTIVE
IT'S ALL NATURAL ENGLAND THE BODY THAT LOOKS AFTER ENGLAND'S WILDLIFE CONFIRMS THAT EVERY SINGLE NEWT HE'S BEEN TRAPPED HIM MOVED THE DIGGERS MUST STAY SILENT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SMALL SITE IF YOU'RE PUTTING FENCING UP IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE REGION OF FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IF YOU LOOK IN A MUCH BIGGER SITE OBVIOUSLY IT CAN ESCALATE
NOW THE CONSULTATION BEING RUN BY NATURAL ENGLAND SAYS THIS PROCESS IS TOO RIGID RATHER THAN TRYING TO SAVE EACH ANIMAL THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON CREATING NEW IMPROVED HABITATS ON DIFFERENT SITES THEY ARGUE THAT NEW SIMPLE D.N.A. TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS AND CUT COSTS WHILE HELPING LARGER NEW POPULATIONS TO FLOURISH
NOW THIS COULD MEAN LESS FENCING WORK FOR SARAH AND HER COLLEAGUES BUT SHE BELIEVES THE PROCESS DOES NEED TO CHANGE IS QUITE PROMISING DEVELOPMENT WE DON'T REALLY SEE THAT PUTTING FENCING SPENDING ON THAT HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BENEFIT GREAT CRESTED NEWTS IN THE LONG RUN SO I THINK WE DEFINITELY WELCOME THOSE MEASURES COMING
TO INCREASE THE GREAT CRESTED NEWT POPULATION AS A WHOLE OR THOSE WHO FELT THE EFFECTS OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM CERTAINLY AGREE
I'VE COME TO MELKSHAM TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB AND IT'S IN A BIT OF A SAD STATE IT WAS BUILT IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND IT'S PRETTY DILAPIDATED AND WITH ME HERE IS DAVE WILTSHIRE HE'S THE CLUB CHURN AND WE SHOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE SHOULD BE DATES WE SHOULD BE IN YOUR SHINY NEW GROUND BUT GREAT CRESTED NEWTS GOT IN THE WAY
YES THEY DID IT WAS ALL TO DO WITH THEIR HIBERNATION TIME AND EVERYTHING FOR ABOUT A YEAR BEHIND WHERE WE SHOULD BE WE WON THE LEAGUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE CLUB'S HISTORY SO HUNDRED TWENTY ODD YEARS AT THE NEW PLACE IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN READY THEN WE WOULD'VE GOT PROMOTED IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING FOR EVERYBODY SO WE HAVE TO THINK OF A NEW STADIUM NAME FOR A NEW GROUND BUT IT MIGHT BE CALLED THE STADIUM BUT ANYBODY IN THE BUILDING TRADE IT MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE SO IF THEY ARE GOING TO RELAX AND ALL I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DELIGHTED ABOUT
JOHN DIXON HE'S POSITIVE WITH A CAVEAT I THINK PROBABLY GREAT CRESTED NEWTS ARE SLIGHTLY OVER PROTECTED REALLY BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT SHAME IF IT BECAME THE SITUATION THAT EVERYTHING WAS BEING DONE TO SAVE THE DEVELOPERS' MONEY AND HANG THE NUDE SO TO SPEAK THE CONSULTATION ENDS ON THURSDAY
THAT REPORT FROM CLAIRE MARSHALL THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN WHAT TO THE PALOMA PAPERS TELL US ABOUT THE WAY THE INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS REGIME WORKS IN RELATION TO COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA AFTER THE LAW FIRM MUST LIKE VON SECKER WAS FOUNT OF ACT ONCE ACTED FOR A FRONT COMPANY FOR A NORTH KOREAN BANK LINKED TO ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMME DARRYL KIMBLE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE WASHINGTON BASED ARMS CONTROL ASSOCIATION AND ANTI PROLIFERATION ORGANISATION
I THINK THIS IS A LOCK TO NORTH KOREA'S METHODS
INVADING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL SANCTIONS SO THEY CAN FINANCE ITS WEAPONS PROGRAMMES SPECIFICALLY ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMMES
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY THIS PARTICULAR SHELL COMPANY THIS OFF SHORING OF THEIR FINANCING THAT THIS OCCURS
HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES IN CHINA THEY HAVE DEALINGS WITH NORTH KOREA MANY OF THEM PROBABLY WERE SET UP IN A SIMILAR FASHION IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE A FRONT COMPANIES FOR
NORTH KOREAN ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING BUSINESS OVERSEAS IN THEN FUNNELLING THE MONEY BACK INTO NORTH KOREA AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THE USE OF LAW FIRMS THEN IN THAT IN THAT PROCESS OF LEGITIMISE ASIAN OR APPEARING TO TO MAKE AN ENTITY LEGITIMATE
WELL IT'S IT'S CRITICAL NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN SANCTIONED FOR NEARLY A DECADE MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR NORTH KOREA TOO
OPENLY ENGAGE IN TRADE IN FINANCING SPECIFICALLY OF ENTITIES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN IT SNOOKER IN A SAW PROGRAMME SO THEY HAVE TO FIND A LAW FIRM NOT TO LOOK CAREFULLY ENOUGH TO SEE IT WITH THE DIRECTORS
ONE OF THESE SURE COMPANIES ACTUALLY IS SO THIS IS THE KIND OF OPERATION STATES THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENTS NEED TO SHUT DOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT FOR NORTH KOREA TO TO GET THE FINANCING TO CONTINUE WOULD SILT WAS CERTAIN CLEAR MUSCLE PROGRAMMES IN PRACTICE ALL THE AUTHORITIES QUITE SLOW TO ACT GIVEN THE FACT THAT AT THIS PARTICULAR NORTH KOREAN BANK THAT'S BEEN NAMED IN THE PARAMOR PAPERS WAS SANCTIONED BY THE U.S. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND SAID AT THAT TIME TO HAVE BEEN RAISING FUNDS FOR THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME SINCE IT WAS SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX
WELL IT'S HARD IT AT THIS STAGE ARE BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PARTICULAR CASE TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS THE REGULATORS THEY WERE ACTING TOO SLOWLY OR THAT THERE ARE JUST SO MANY POSSIBLE FRONT COMPANIES THAT IT'S TOO DIFFICULT
THE REGULATORS TO FIND THE VIOLATORS DO YOU THINK THESE PAPERS ARE GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN IN SPARKING GREATER AWARENESS OR GREATER CRACKDOWN THEY SHOULD AMID FRANKLY THERE THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE HERE IN THIS CASE WITH THE NORTH KOREAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS THE KIND OF THING THAT HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THE PROBLEM IS THERE
SEVERAL DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS PATRIK OF THE CHINESE ARE NOT ENFORCING THE EXISTING SANCTIONS STRINGENTLY ENOUGH
AND NORTH KOREA AND OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE IT THAT OUR SANCTION CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO EVADE THE SYSTEM SO THAT THE SANCTIONS REGIME HAS BEEN SLOW
BEING PUT TOGETHER AND NORTH KOREA HAS BANNED RELATIVELY FASTER AND FINDING WAYS AROUND THE SENTIENTS DARYL CAMPBELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU A STATEMENT FROM A SACK VON SECKER HAS SAID WE'VE NEVER KNOWINGLY ALLOWED THE USE OF A COMPANY'S BY INDIVIDUALS HAVING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA WE HAVE OUR OWN PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE EXTENT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO SIX THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WILL RULE TODAY ON WHETHER TO THROW OUT THE CASE AGAINST KENYA'S DEPUTY PRESIDENT WILLIAM ROUTER HE'S BEEN CHARGED WITH CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN VIOLENCE AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ELECTION WHEN TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED HE DENIES ALL THE CHARGES AND HIS LAWYER SAYS THE CASE SHOULD BE THROWN OUT BECAUSE OF LACK OF EVIDENCE
GENOA IS A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE FOR THE AFRICA PROGRAMME AT CHATHAM HOUSE AND AS HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO MONK CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED OR AT LEAST WHAT IT WHAT HE'S ACCUSED OF DOING IN TWO THOUSAND
YES WHAT THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF KENYA WILLIAM ROTO IS ACCUSED ALONGSIDE A RADIO PRESENTER JOSHUA UP SIGN OF BEING A CO PERPETRATOR OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS THAT HAPPENED IN KENYA INTAE THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN AS HE SAID TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND OVER HALF A MILLION KENYANS WERE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND RITA AND SANG ARE ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN
MURDER IN PERSECUTION AND ENFORCED DEPORTATIONS HERE WE ARE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THERE'S THIS WE'RE HEARING TODAY WHETHER THE CASE WILL BE DROPPED AND PART OF THE REASON IT MIGHT BE IS THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PROSECUTORS HAD ORIGINALLY HOPED WOULD BE FORTHCOMING HAS BEEN WHAT SLIPPING THROUGH THEIR FINGERS
THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THE KENYA SITUATION HAS BEEN A REAL TEST CASE FOR THE ICY SEA ITSELF AND IT'S SHOWING EIGHTY C. THAT IGNORING THE POLITICAL NUANCES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT WORKS IN IS NOT EFFECTIVE WAY OF RUNNING CASES IN THE KENNETH SITUATION A NUMBER OF WITNESSES HAVE RETRACTED THEIR ORIGINAL STATEMENTS OR HAVE ALSO DISAPPEARED OR BEEN KILLED
THERE HAVE BEEN ALLEGATIONS THAT THE ICE IS HE HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT THE WITNESSES IN KENYA OH KAY AND SO AS A RESULT WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE THE CASE COULD BE DROPPED THERE'S SUDDENLY PRESIDENT FOR THE CASE TO BE DROPPED KENYA'S CURRENT PRESIDENT WHO KENYATTA WAS ALSO INVITED BY THE I.T.C. AT THE SAME TIME THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT WAS THE CASE AGAINST KENYATTA WAS DROPPED IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE A LACKING EVIDENCE AND THE KEPT ITSELF HAS TALKED OF WITHDRAWING FROM THE JURISDICTION OF THE ICY SEA
WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH THAT THAT'S RIGHT IN PARLIAMENT IN KENYA EMOTIONAL AS ACTUALLY PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN TO WITHDRAW FROM THE I.C.C. AND KENYA ALSO AND DONE A LOT OF WORK TO RALLY AFRICAN SUPPORT FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM THE I.C.C. ACROSS THE BOARD THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS HAPPENING IS QUITE LOW IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATES AND AFRICA TO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR OWN STATUTE
AND IT ALSO OBSCURES THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN AND ALSO MORE WIDELY IN AFRICA FOR THE ICY SEA THERE'S A FEELING THAT WITHOUT AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT LEADER CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY IN SITUATIONS OF TENSION SUCH AS HAPPENED IN THE ELECTIONS IN HASN'T SEVEN SO HOW IS THIS PARTICULAR CASE FOOD AGAIN
THE CASE IS VIEW THERE'S A VERY MIXED ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CASE IN KENYA AMONGST DEPUTY PRESIDENT ROUTE OH SUPPORT BASE IN THE RIFT VALLEY THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE I.T.C. HAS BEEN A REAL DISTRACTION FROM MUCH MORE PRESSING CONCERNS IN KENYA
FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT THERE'S A MILLION KENYANS ADDED TO THE POPULATION EVERY YEAR THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND BASIC SERVICE DELIVERY AND ALSO THE FACT THE KENYA FACED INCREASED TERRORISM OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND SO
THERE ARE REAL PRESSING CONCERNS AND THE ICY SCENE AS SOME OF THE DISTRACTION FROM THAT I WILL GET THEIR DECISION TODAY A JEWELLER AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S GET THE WEATHER NOW CHRIS FAWKES HE'S HERE CHRIS GOOD MORNING WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTBREAKS OF RAIN TODAY ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AS WELL BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CLOUDY START BRIGHTENING UP THROUGH THE DAY SO WITH MORE DETAIL SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF CLOUD TO START THE DAY BUT MANY AREAS WILL SEE THINGS BRIGHTENING UP REALLY QUITE QUICKLY

FOR NORTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND IT'S A CLOUDY START WITH OUTBREAKS OF RAIN RAIN WILL LAST FOR A FEW HOURS ACROSS LANCASHIRE AND CUMBRIA BEFORE EASING THE RAIN THERE WILL BE A BIT MORE RELUCTANT TO CLEAR AWAY FROM NORTH EAST ENGLAND SO THE LIKES OF NORTHUMBERLAND THROUGH COUNTY DURHAM AND INTO NORTH YORKSHIRE WE WILL SEE THE RAIN LINGERING INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE AFTERNOON BUT PROBABLY SOME LATE THEY BRIGHTNESS HIGHS OF ELEVEN DEGREES
IN NORTHERN IRELAND A DRY DAY COMING UP HERE WITH SOME BRIGHT OR SUNNY SPELLS COMING AND GOING AND HIGHS OF TWELVE DEGREES CELSIUS IN SCOTLAND HOWEVER WE'VE GOT CLOUD AND WIDESPREAD OUTBREAKS OF RAIN FROM BECOMING A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER AND PATCHIER AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE AFTERNOON BUT RELUCTANT TO CLEAR AWAY FROM NORTH EASTERN AREAS THE WEST TURNING BRIGHTER BUT TOMORROW NATIONWIDE IS CAN BE A MUCH COLDER DAY THAT'S THE WEATHER CHRIS THANKS VERY MUCH

ALTHOUGH THE CONSERVATIVE LED COMMITTEE DOES NOT DIRECTLY ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF DOWNPLAYING HUMAN RIGHT IN ITS DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES THE M.P.S DO FIND THAT MINISTERS AND SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE GIVEN THAT IMPRESSION LAST YEAR THE MOST SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE ADMITTED IN HIS EVIDENCE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS WAS NOT ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES AND THAT THE PROSPERITY AGENDA IS FURTHER UP THE LIST

THE ACTOR ERIC BARRASS FELT WHO'S DIED BUT I WAS DOWN NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'LL BE A SERIES OF MEETINGS TODAY AIMED AT TRYING TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF THE TATA STEEL PLANT AT PORT TALBOT THE PRIME MINISTER IS TALKING TO THE FIRST MINISTER OF WALES THE BUSINESS SECRETARY TO THE UNIONS AND TO A POTENTIAL BUYER OF THE STEEL WORKS BUT THEY MAY NOT BE MUCH TIME TO PUT ANY SOLUTION TOGETHER BEFORE THE PLANT WHICH IS LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY IS SHUT DOWN WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NICK CLEGG AND THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT M.P. FOR SHEFFIELD HALLAM GOOD MORNING
MORNING HOW DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE HANDLED
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS NOW HAVING BEEN FOUND TO BE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL AT THE OUTSET APPEARS NOW TO BE PULLING OUT ALL STOPS AS IT SHOULD DO TO TRY AND FIND
A BUYER AND AS I THINK YOU ALL YOUR NEWS REPORTS SUGGESTED THE PENSION LIABILITIES AT TARTAR THERE ARE IN MY VIEW PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL BECAUSE IT'S A BIT LIKE A BALL AND CHAIN ROUND THERE
THE COMPANY'S ANGLES AT THE MOMENT A NEW BUYER WOULD WANT TO HAVE SOME REASSURANCE THAT THEY WON'T INHERIT ALL OF THOSE LIABILITIES SO I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS INDICATED THAT IT'S GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD DO I THINK I'M A BIT I THINK BEYOND THOUGH FINDING THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE OF FINDING A BUYER I DO THINK THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SHIFT GEAR ON TWO FRONTS FIRSTLY THEY NEED TO REVERSE THERE
THEIR APPARENT INDIFFERENCE TO CONTINUING WITH THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGIES WHICH WE ARE LONG TERM INDUSTRIAL STRATEGIES WHICH VINCE CABLE AND THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT A SET OUT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH GIVE INVESTORS REASSURANCE THAT WAS A LONG TERM APPROACH TO ATTEMPT TO MAJOR SECTORS LIKE LIKE THE STEW PRODUCING SECTOR AND I'M GOING TO FINALLY WE REALLY DO NEED TO REVISIT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF WHAT WE DO WITH THIS FLOOD OF
OVERPRODUCED CHINESE STEEL MARKETS LET IT'S MASSIVE LET'S TALK FIRST OF ALL ABOUT THE PENSION LIABILITY POINTS SO YOU ARE CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ON THE PENSION LIABILITY THAT ARISES FROM THE TARTAR STEELWORKS CORRECT THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DO BUT THERE'S THERE HAS TO BE SOME SOME GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO LIGHTEN THE BURDEN OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES WERE IN THE NEW BUYER I THINK IF YOU
IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT IT'S ALREADY GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A NEW BORROW BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY QUALITIES ARE SO GREAT EXACTLY SEEM TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAGEY ON ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE STATE AID
POSSIBLE BETTER THOSE RULES WELL THAT'S ONE OF THEM BUT MY OWN VIEW IS THAT THERE'S A WING THE WEATHER WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE IS A WAY NOW IS AS YOU MAY KNOW THE GOVERNMENT QUITE RECENTLY STEPPED IN TO DEAL WITH THE PENSION LIABILITIES AT ROYAL MAIL NOW THAT WAS A PUBLICLY A PUBLIC PUBLICLY OWNED COMPANIES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
BUT HE WAS ALSO A COMPANY WHICH HAD A LONG TERM FUTURE EVERYONE RECOGNISED THAT IT DID I THINK TURTLE STEEL GIVEN THE THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT IT FACES IS THIS OVERPRODUCTION OF CHINESE OR STEAL THEM DUMPED AT OR BELOW COST PRICES ON ON WORLD MARKETS GIVEN THAT TART A STEEL DOES HAVE A LONG TERM FUTURE IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND YEARS
DOES ALSO HAVE A LONG TERM FUTURE AND THEREFORE I THINK IT IS LEGITIMATE TO TAKE THE SAME APPROACH AS WE TAKEN ELSEWHERE TO DEAL WITH A PUNCH LIABILITY IT ISN'T THERE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM WITH ENERGY COSTS IN IN THE U.K. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WHILE IN GOVERNMENT ADDED TO THROUGH THROUGH THEIR SUPPORT OF OF GREEN TAXES FOR EXAMPLE THE U.K. HAS HIGHER ELECTRICITY COSTS THAN OTHER THAN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE AND THAT IS AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE CHINESE PROBLEM AS IT IS AT THE MOMENT
YEAH I THINK IT DOES PLAY A FACTOR WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN COALITION GOVERNMENT WEEK SALT CONSENT FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO PROVIDE REBATES TO TART OR STEEL AND OTHER ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES OR DO YOU REGRET PUSHING FOR GREEN TAXES AS MUCH AS YOU DID SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
NO I THINK MOST ANALYSTS ACCEPT THAT THE VIDEO AT THE COSTS THAT THE MAIN COSTS OF COURSE ENERGY PLAYS UP A MAIN ROLE BUT IT'S PAY PAYROLL WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIG COSTS OF COURSE
THAT THE ENERGY COST CONSTITUTE AROUND SIX TO TEN PER CENT OF THE OVERALL COS OF THE OF THE BUSINESS YOU SIMPLY CANNOT CLAIM THAT IS THE SORT OF KILLER BLOW FORKED OUT A STEEL BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ADDRESS IT SOMETHING WHICH WAS WHICH WAS BEING ADDRESSED AND NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THE BIGGEST STRATEGIC PROBLEM FACING NOT ONLY TALKED OF STEALING IN THE U.K. BUT THE STEEL INDUSTRY ACROSS EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IS THIS UNPRECEDENTED GLUT OF DUMPED
BELOW COST STEEL DUMPED TOOK LOW COS PRICES FROM FROM CHINA AND THE SCALE OF IT IS QUITE ASTONISHING BY SOME RECKONING CHINA HAS PRODUCED OVER TWO YEARS AS MUCH STEEL AS BRITAIN HAS EVER PRODUCED AND IT'S WHOLE STEEL MAKING HISTORY SO I THINK WE NEED TO RE VISIT SOME OF THE
LEEDS' DEFENCE INSTRUMENTS THE ANTI DUMPING DUTIES AND SO ON WHICH CAN HELP US DEAL WITH THIS TEMPORARY GLUT OF OVERPRODUCED CHINESE STEELE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE POTENTIAL BUYER OF THE STEELWORKS SANJIV GOT TO JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK NICK CLEGG THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN M.P.S ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE HAVE CRITICISED THE GOVERNMENT FOR GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS THEY SAY WHAT MINISTERS IN THE FOREIGN OFFICE SAY HAS UNDERMINED THE WORK OF THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. CRISPIN BLUNT JOINS US FROM GUILDFORD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOUR CRITICISM IS VERY MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAY RATHER THAN WHAT THEY DO
THIS REPORT IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST OF THE FIVE REPORTS IN THE COURSE OF THIS PARLIAMENT WHERE WE ASSESS HOW THE FOREIGN OFFICE PROMOTES HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD IT HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY OF OURS THEY'RE CHANGING THE WAY THEY DO IT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN LANGUAGE NOR CHANGIN SYMBOLOGY WHICH WOULD SUGGEST IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT USED TO BE UNDER WILLIAM HAGUE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REMAINS AS IMPORTANT AS IT AS IT USED TO BE SO IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DO AS MUCH AS WHAT THEY SAY
OH IT'S JUST THAT I'M A BING AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED THAT CAN SUCK SOME OF THE REPORTING ON A HAS BEEN THAT IT'S JUST THE IMPRESSION THEY CREATE THE PERCEPTION RATHER THAN THE REALITY OF IT IS VERY MUCH THE PERCEPTION THAT IS WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A CRITICISM AT THE MINUTE THERE IS THAT THE CURRENT SET OF MINISTERS HAVE ALLOWED A PERCEPTION
TO GAIN GROUND THAT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT AS IT USED TO BE AND NOW THE FOREIGN SECRETARY'S QUITE RIGHTLY POINTED OUT AS WE RECOGNISE THAT THERE PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THAT MONEY BECAUSE IT IS RING FENCED TO COUNTRIES THAT COKE CAN HAVE DEFEATED ASSISTANCE SO ONLY THREE PER CENT OF THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA BAHRAIN ISRAEL AND RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE
YOU ALSO QUIT YOU SINGLE OUT TOBIAS ELWOOD THE MIDDLE EAST MINISTER FOR PARTICULAR CRITICISM THIS AND THIS BECAUSE HER COMMENTS HE MADE AFTER THE CAMBRIDGE STUDENT JULIA AGAIN IT WAS KILLED AND TORTURED AN EEJIT
YES I THINK THE OFFICE HASN'T REALLY STOOD UP TO THE PLATE IN THE WAY THAT THE ITALIANS AND PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT WHEN A CAMBRIDGE DOCTORAL STUDENT I FELL INTO THAT PIERCED ALL AND TRANSPOSE SORT OF FALL INTO THE HANDS OF EGYPTIAN SECURITY FORCES AND ENDED UP BEING TORTURED AND KILLED
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE MAKING A REAL NOISE ABOUT THAT NOT LEAST COS I THINK IT HELPS THE HAND OF PRESIDENT C. C. WHO IS BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE CULTURE OF IMPUNITY OF THE EGYPTIAN INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES AND PARTICULARLY WAS WE SHOULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE MIDDLE EAST MINISTER HE COULDN'T EVEN RECALL WHETHER HE'D RAISED HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN HE WAS ON A TRIP TO EGYPT WELL THAT WAS A REEF LIFTED A QUOTE FROM HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH TO SHOW HOW CONCERNED THEY WERE AND THEY SUDDENLY PLACED EGYPT AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST OF CONCERNS
THAT'S NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF JUDEA RICH RIDGING IT SHOULD BE SAID BECAUSE THAT HAPPENED AFTER OFF THAT'S REPORT AND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY THEY SAYS I DON'T RECOGNISE THIS CHARACTERISATION OF A HUMAN RIGHTS WORK AND HUGH IMPROVING HUMAN RIGHTS OR CORE FUNCTION OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY BRITISH DIPLOMAT WELL THE FOUR OFFICE IS CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S GOING TO REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS THEY USED TO HAVE SO CALLED SIX PLUS TWO THEMES HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THREE THEMES THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A SLIGHTLY SHORTER
VERSION OF THE ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE FIRST OF THOSE IN THE NEXT MONTH AND WHAT THE COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO DO TODAY IS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THIS WITH A WIDESPREAD VIEW THAT HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN DE PRIORITISED TO SEE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND WERE ASKING A FOREIGN OFFICE
TO IMPROVE THE ACCOUNTING OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ACHIEVE WE'VE SAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS A COUPLE OF CAUSES AND A COUPLE OF COUNTRIES AND COME BACK TO THEM EVERY EVERY EVERY YEAR TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF THE U.K.'S BEST KNOWN BUSINESSMEN THINKS BRITAIN SHOULD QUIT B. E. YOU'VE JO LINE HAS MORE JOHN CAUDWELL SET UP THE MOBILE PHONE RETAILER PHONES FOR YOU IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES BEFORE SELLING AT A DECADE AGO FOR ALMOST ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS PHONE'S FOR YOU IS NO LONGER WITH US BUT JOHN CAUDWELL'S PHILANTHROPY STILL IS JOHN IS A KEEN THOUGH FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. ALTHOUGH WE WASN'T AWARE THAT HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON VOTE LEAVES BUSINESS COUNCIL WHEN IT WAS PUBLISHED TWO WEEKS AGO GOOD MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING WHY SHOULD BRITAIN LEAVE THE E.U.
I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HYSTERIA AS TO WHY WHY BRITAIN SHOULD STAY UM THERE'S A LOT OF SUBJECTIVITY BUT THE REAL FACTS OF THE MATTER OR THAT WE HAVE AND WE SUFFER AN EIGHT BILLION LOSS TO EUROPE IN A NET LOSS
THAT'S EIGHT BILLION THAT COULD BE USED TO GROW THE WIPER CONTRIBUTIONS CONTRIBUTIONS NET NET LOSS SO WE PAY ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN BILLION AND GET SOME OF IT BUT THE NET LOSS IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION BILLION GOT FROM THE BRITISH TAXPAYER YEAH GONE FORGOT AND OF COURSE THE NORWEGIANS AND THE SWISS ALSO PAID TO BE AN EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT IN THE
YES BUT THE CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE A LOT THAT A LOT LESS THAN WE PAY AND THAT APE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CONTRIBUTION WE'VE GOT AN EIGHT BILLION LOSS BUT THAT IN ADDITION TO WHICH WE HAVE THE SECURITY RISK AS A RESULT OF THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES OF EUROPE AND EUROPEAN PASSPORTS COME IN ENTER THE DO YOU THINK LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD MEAN PEOPLE MUCH FEWER PEOPLE FROM EUROPE POORER PARTS OF YOUR BOAT WILL COME INTO THAT TO BRITAIN
IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE FROM EUROPE IT'S WHAT IS THE FACT THAT THE IMMIGRATION POLICY IS SET BY THE EUROPEANS NOT BY THE BRITISH WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SET OUR OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY AND THEY'RE JUST BEAR DOESN'T AS A NON SHAKEN MEMBER ALREADY SAID IT'S ITS OWN EMIGRATION POLICY CHECKS EVERY PASSPORT
YES HE CHECKS EVERY PASSPORT BUT WITH THE EUROPEAN SITUATION ISSUE HIM PASSPORTS WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THE ASSURANCE OF EUROPEAN PASSPORTS ANOTHER OTHER COUNTRIES OH KAY AND YOU'RE A VERY WEALTHY MAN HE'S DONE VERY WELL SO YOU WON'T REALLY BE AFFECTED OF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN OR TO LEAVE QUITE A FEW CONSUMERS THERE WILL BE AFFECTED FOR EXAMPLE B.A.A. SAYS AVERT A PETROL PRICES WILL GO UP CENTRICA SAYS THE GAS BILLS MY CO OP SO I KNOW THEIR ORDINARY LIVES MAY CHANGE AS WELL AS THE JOB SO MIGHT BE LOST
YOU RIGHT THAT I WON'T BE AFFECTED BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE BRITISH CITIZEN WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE LEAVING OF EUROPE AND ALL OF THIS AFFECTING JOBS YOU HERE THREE MILLION JOBS WILL BE THREATENED AS A RESOURCE AND LEAVING EUROPE THAT'S COMPLETE RUBBISH YOU'LL BE IN A FREE COUNTRY TO TRADE WITH EVERY ROYAL EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND NOT TO BE SEEN TO BE JUST A PORTERS ON PART OF EUROPE
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES WILL BE FREE TO SET A TRADING PHILOSOPHIES AND POLICIES WITH ALL THE CONTRACT DOES NOT STOP IN BRITAIN SELLING THE GOODS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD GERMANY ALREADY SELLS MORE GOODS TO INDIA DESPITE HAVING NO COLONIAL LINKS NOW THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP HER SETTING SETTING TRADING POLICIES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE A HORSE BUT WE ARE SEEN TO BE MORE PARTISAN WITH EUROPE I THINK BEING A FREE CONTRARY TO COMPLETELY FREELY TRADE WITH THE WORLD AND NOT BE SEEN TO BE
INTEGRAL PART OF EUROPE IS A POSITIVE THING CAN I CAN I BRING YOU AREN'T BRIEFING AS WE'RE RUNNING SHORT OF TIME TO GET TO THE SCANDAL AT A MERGING WITH THESE DIS LEEKS YOU'RE SUPPOSEDLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST INCOME TAXPAYERS IN THIS COUNTRY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T PUBLISH LISTS WHAT DO YOU MAKE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HIDE THEIR INCOMES OR AVOID PAYING TAX IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME NOW I'VE BEEN PUSHING A VERY MORAL STANCE ON THIS THAT FROM A SENSE OF MORALITY
PEOPLE NEEDED TO PAY THE INCOME TAX IN THE U.K. PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE O.K. HAVE A WONDERFUL CIVILISATION A WONDERFUL COUNTRY OUGHT TO PAY THEIR DUES THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT LEAVE EVERYTHING A LITTLE BIT VAGUE AND HAVE DONE FOR VERY MANY YEARS AND THEY LEAVE THE TAX SYSTEM OPEN TO BE ABUSED
AND I REMEMBER RIGHT FROM THE EARLY DAYS WHEN I STARTED MAKING MONEY THAT MY ACCOUNTANCY FIRM POURED TAX ADVISORS TO ADVISE ON TAX SAVING SCHEMES AND
IF THAT IS ALL WRONG WHAT WE NEED IS VERY VERY CLEAR GUIDANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS TO WHAT TAX AVOIDANCE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED YOU ALMOST NEED A LIST
ACTIVITY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE LIKE ICES AND EVERYTHING ELSE BEING VERY HEAVILY PENALISED FOR INCORRECT BEHAVIOUR WHICH IS A VERY DIFFICULT AREA BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A GREY AREA IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN WHERE ACCEPTABLE TAX REDUCTION WHERE IT'S ACCEPTABLE AND WHERE IT GOES INTO A GREY AREA AND THEN WHERE IT BECOMES VERY AGGRESSIVE
JOHN CAUDWELL PHILANTHROPIST AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN THANKS FOR JOINING US THANK YOU JOE THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT DOES SHAKESPEARE'S LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT TELL US ABOUT HIM AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FAMILY X. RAY AN INFRARED ANALYSIS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD DOCUMENT BY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY HAS REVEALED THAT THE WILL WAS DRAFTED AT THREE DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME HERE'S HOW IT BEGINS
I WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD UPON AVON IN THE COUNTY OF WARWICK IN PERFECT HEALTH AND MEMORY GOD BE PRAISED DO MAKE AND ORDAIN THIS MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT IN MANNER AND FORM
THAT IS TO SAY FIRST I COMMEND MY SOUL INTO THE HANDS OF GOD MY CREATOR HOPING AND ASSUREDLY BELIEVING THROUGH THE ONLY MERITS OF JESUS CHRIST MY SAVIOUR TO BE PAR TAKER OF LIFE EVERLASTING AND MY BODY TO THE EARTH WHERE ALL OF IT HE'S MADE IT INCLUDES BEQUEST TO HIS FAMILY AND HIS FRIENDS
I BEQUEATH MY JOHN TWENTY SIX SHILLINGS AND EIGHT PENCE AND TO MY FELLOWS JOHN HEMMINGS RICHARD BURBAGE AND HENRY CAN'T TWENTY SIX SHILLINGS AND EIGHT PENCE APIECE TO BUY THEM RINGS
I GAVE ONE TO MY WIFE MY SECOND BEST BED WITH THE FURNITURE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY AMANDA BEVAN THE LEGAL RECORD SPECIALIST AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES GOOD MORNING MORNING AND THIS POINT ABOUT THE SECOND BEST BED TO GO AND HIS WIFE ANN HAS HAS LONG BEEN REGARDED AS AS EVIDENCE OF OF OF A SLIGHT FROM SHAKESPEARE TOWARDS HER
DOES THIS STOCK IN THIS NEW ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENT CHANGE THAT I THINK IT DOES I THINK THE OLD ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENT AS BEING WRITTEN VERY MUCH IN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN HAS CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE IN THE PAST BECAUSE OVER SCHOLARS BECAUSE THE WHOLE TENOR OF THE WILLS IS DESCRIBED AS SOUR UNKIND UNGENEROUS AND PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE THE BECKHAM BEST SECOND BEST BED SEEMED TO
WHERE THIS OUT BECAUSE HIS WIFE ISN'T MENTIONED OTHERWISE BUT A NEW DATING OF THE WILL WHICH WE THINK HAS GOT AT LEAST ONE PAGE WHICH IS WRITTEN IN SIXTEEN THIRTEEN THREE YEARS BEFORE SHOWS THAT AND THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS USING HIS WELL AS COME LIKE A BUSINESS FAMILY FAMILY DOCUMENT IS PLANNING HIS ESTATE WHAT'S TO HAPPEN AFTER HIS DEATH IT'S NOT THE KIND OF WILL WHERE YOU WHERE YOU WOULD PUT IN MENTIONS OF MY BELOVED WIFE ET-CETERA WHO DID THE BEST BED TO GO TO
I'LL PROBABLY HIS DAUGHTER SUSANNA WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING IS HE HAS TWO BEST BIRDS HE WAS DOING VERY WELL INDEED FIDGET GIBB GIVING TWO HOMES NO HE HAD HE HAD A HOUSE AS SOMETHING LIKE TEN BEDROOMS OUT AND AT LEAST TWO OF US BEST BUT TO HAVE THOSE BEDS WERE WHAT YOU MIGHT DESCRIBE AS TOP QUALITY SO HIS HIS WIFE GETS THE SECOND ONE THE BEST ONE THE REAL BEST ONE ALWAYS GOES TO THE AIR RIGHT O.K. AND AND THE FACT THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT JUST WRITTEN AT ONE MOMENT IN TIME BUT IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS ADDED TO
WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST SOME SOMEONE A BIT BECOMING BECOMING RICHER IN ABLE TO TO LOOK AT THINGS AGAIN BUT HE'S BEEN ACCUMULATING PROPERTY FOR QUITE A LONG TIME FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS BEFORE HE DIES AND IT'S ONLY SENSIBLE IF YOU'RE ACCUMULATING PROPERTY TO ACTUALLY KEEP YOUR AFFAIRS UP TO DATE WE THINK HE WROTE THE WILL AND SIXTEEN THIRTEEN BECAUSE HE JUST INVESTED IN A MAJOR LONDON PROPERTY FOR THE FIRST TIME SO WE'VE GOT THE BLACK FRIARS GATE HOUSE AND HE
HE BOUGHT THIS USING TRUSTEES' AND IF YOU DO IF YOU BUY USING TRUSTEES' YOU REALLY NEED TO INFORM THE TRUSTEES WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN IF YOU'RE NO LONGER AROUND SO HE WRITES A WILL TO SAY IT SHOULD GO TO MY DAUGHTER'S ANNA
AMOUNT OF EVAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WITH ANNOUNCED TODAY HAVE HAD PLANS TO PRESS AHEAD WITH THE PROSECUTION AGAINST KENYA'S DEPUTY PRESIDENT WILLIAM BRUTAL HE DENIES CHARGES OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATHS OF TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE VIOLENCE THAT FOLLOWED THE ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS IS TO BE SPENT ON TWO OF THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCES WINDSOR CASTLE AND THE PALACE OF HOLYROOD HOUSE THE MONEY WHICH WILL BE RAISED BY THE ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE VISITOR FACILITIES
IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE PAN AM A LEGAL FIRM AT THE HEART OF THE MASSIVE DATA LEEK KEPT CLIENTS WHO WERE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS MUST LIKE VON SECKER WORKED WITH THIRTY THREE PEOPLE OR COMPANIES WHO AT SOME POINT FACED ACTION FROM THE U.S. TREASURY THEY INCLUDE COMPANIES LINKED TO NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND A CLOSE RELATIVE OF SYRIA'S PRESIDENT SIMON COX REPORTS
THIS IS THE OFFICE IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS OF LAW FIRM MOST SACK VON SECKER YEAH I'M TRYING TO FIND
NATION OF COMPANY
IT'S HOME TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COMPANIES BUT THEY ONLY EXIST ON PAPER
WE ALREADY KNOW SOME HAVE BEEN USED TO EVADE TAXES OR LAUNDER MONEY BUT WE CAN REVEAL SOME OF THE COMPANY SET UP BY MO SACK VON SECKER HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS
ONE OF THESE FIRMS IS A COMPANY CALLED CAREX TECHNOLOGIES THE LEAKED DOCUMENTS REVEAL THE REAL OWNER WAS SYRIAN BUSINESSMAN RAMI MACHLI'S COUSIN OF PRESIDENT ASAD REPORTEDLY WORTH FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
HE WAS SANCTIONED BY THE U.S. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS A CORRUPT REGIME INSIDER
DAVID LESHAN HISTORIAN AND BIOGRAPHER OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASAD HAS MET RAMI MACHLI'S HE ROSE UP IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BUT HE HAS SPREAD HIS WINGS OR IT'S ON THE TURN OF COURSE
THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO AREA OF CEREAL YOU CAN DO BUSINESS WITHOUT FIRST GETTING THE APPROVAL OF MY CLOTHES AND HIS COMPANIES
WHAT'S MORE THE FILES REVEAL THE BANK WORKING FOR REMMY MACHLI'S ANDREX TECHNOLOGIES WHILE HE WAS SANCTIONED WAS THE SWISS ARM OF H.S.B.C.
IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THIS REMARKABLE EMAIL WAS SENT BY MO SACK ON SECONDS COMPLIANCE TEAM AFTER A CONVERSATION THEY HAD WITH H.S.B.C.
H.S.B.C. COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT OF THE BANK NOT ONLY IN GENEVA BUT ALSO IN THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON NO ABOUT MY MAC LOOF AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH HIM
WHEN MO SACK VON SECONDS HEAD OF COMPLIANCE REALISE THAT RAMMY MCLEAN WAS ON A SANCTIONS LIST THEY RECOMMEND TO BOSSES DROPPING HIM AS A CLIENT BUT CHRIS ON INJURE ONE OF MOST SACK VON SECONDS PARTNERS REPLIED
FROM MY PART IF H.S.B.C. HEADQUARTERS IN ENGLAND DO NOT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE CLIENT THEN I THINK WE CAN ALSO EXCEPT HIM
MOST LIKE VON SECKER FINALLY STOPPED DOING BUSINESS WITH RAMI MACHLI'S AND FIVE OTHER COMPANIES THEY HAD WITH HIM IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
AS FOR H.S.B.C. WE DON'T KNOW THEY TOLD US THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORITIES TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME AND IMPLEMENT SANCTIONS TOM KEATING DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL CRIME OF THE THINK TANK RUTHIE SAYS THEY SHOULD HAVE SPOTTED THE PROBLEM YEARS BEFORE
SOON AS YOU'RE AWARE THAT AN ACCOUNT HOLDER IS SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS THAT ACCOUNT SHOULD BE FROZEN AND YOU SHOULD INFORM YOUR LOCAL FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITH SOMEBODY SANCTIONED ON YOUR BOOKS IS CLEARLY IN RESPONSE
MACHLI'S WASN'T A ONE OFF MOST COMPANIES GIVE ANY FINANCIAL FIRMS IN NORTH KOREA A WIDE BERTH BUT NOT MO SACK VON SECKER
IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A NORTH KOREAN BANK CALLED DEDE ON CREDIT BANK WAS SANCTIONED BY THE U.S. FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR MISSILE PROGRAMME
THE BANK HAD SET UP A FRONT COMPANY WITH THE SAME INITIALS CALLED D. C. B. FINANCE THIS WAS ALSO SANCTIONED BY THE U.S. FOR RAISING FUNDS FOR THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX
THE COMPANY THAT IT REGISTERED AND RUN D. C. B. FINANCE WAS MOST SACK VON SECKER
THEY DIDN'T TAKE NOTICE OF THE NORTH KOREA LINK UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN THEY STOPPED DOING BUSINESS WITH D. C. B.
THIS LATER EMAIL FROM MO SACK VON SECONDS LEGAL DEPARTMENT ADMITS THEY'VE MADE A BIG MISTAKE
WE HAVE NOT YET ADDRESS THE REASON WE MAINTAINED A RELATIONSHIP WITH D.C. BE FINANCE WHEN WE KNEW
OR OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN FAMINE INCORPORATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THAT THE COUNTRY NORTH KOREA WAS ON THE BLACKLIST
AND MARTIN KENNY A LAWYER IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS WHO DEALS WITH FRAUD CASES CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY SLIP THROUGH THE NET
IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS COMPLIANCE PROBLEM FOR B. B. I TRUST COMPANY TO AGREE TO FORM A COMPANY
FOR ANY PERSON IN NORTH KOREA WITHOUT EXCEPTIONALLY EXTENSIVE DUE DILIGENCE
MOST SACK VON SECKER SAID THEY NEVER KNOWINGLY ALLOWED THE USE OF THEIR COMPANIES BY INDIVIDUALS HAVING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA AND THEY DIDN'T FOSTER OR PROMOTE UNLAWFUL ACTS WITH ELEVEN MILLION DOCUMENTS THERE ARE MANY MORE REVELATIONS TO COME
SIMON COX REPORTING THERE WE'RE JOINED FROM PRAGUE BY THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER GEOFFREY ROBERTSON Q.C. GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IF AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FIRM CAN BEST BE UNAWARE OF THE SANCTIONS ON ITS CLIENTS IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT I SUPPOSE THE WHOLE REGIME IS NOT WORKING
WELL IT WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT LAWYERS ETHICS NEED UPDATING
HOWEVER IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE A COMPANY IS ON THE SANCTIONS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE A LEGAL ADVICE THAT'S WHEN THEY NEED LEGAL ADVICE TO GET THEM TAKEN OFF FOR EXAMPLE
BECAUSE SUMMER WRONGLY LISTED BUT WHAT HAS EMERGED AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING I'M NOT BEING SURPRISED BY MOST OF THESE EMAILS BECAUSE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS IN TAX MINIMISATION JURISDICTIONS AND JURISDICTIONS
SECRECY THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO HIDE THEIR MONEY AND PANAMA HAS BEEN SUCH SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND IT'S BEEN JOINED BY A NUMBER OF BRITISH
DEPENDENCIES IN FACT THE BRITISH EMPIRE HAS SHRUNK LARGELY TO A NUMBER OF TAX HAVENS TREASURE ISLAND DISA'S I HAVE NO IRON BUT WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THESE
REVELATION WAS IS NOT JUST THAT VAST AMOUNTS OF VAST NUMBERS OF WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE HIDING THEIR WEALTH PROBABLY PUT TAX REASONS
IN MANY CASES BUT THAT
A BLIND EYE IS BEING WHICH HAS ENABLED THOSE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS
THEIR MONEY TOTAL SECRECY TO AVOID THOSE SANCTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT WE'VE GOT
AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT FOR ATROCITIES WE'VE WORKED WELL ON NUCLEAR WE'VE GOT AN ORGANISATION THAT INSPECT NUCLEAR POTENTIAL NUCLEAR
WE'VE DONE SOME WORK HIM STOP BEING HUMAN TRAFFICKING DRUG PERFECT EVENING BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEGUN AS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES PARTICULARLY OF TRANSPARENCY OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE IN SECRET THROUGH THE LAWS
RATHER SHONKY COUNTRIES LIKE PANAMA AND LITTLE ISLANDS TO HIDE AND MOVE THEIR WELL
AND THAT IS AND SHE WAS EXTENT THAT IT ENABLES THEM TO BEAT INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS THAT BECOMES A REAL WORRY THOSE SHONKY COUNTRIES ARE YOU INCLUDING BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES IN THAT LISTEN TO LEE I MEAN BRITAIN IS AT THE HEART OF HUBBUB INTERNATIONAL TAX AVOIDANCE
BY ALLOWING THESE ARE LITTLE PIECES OF M. REMNANTS OF THEM
TO HAVE TAX SECRECY LAWS AND ENABLE OFFSHORE
TRUSTS AN OFF SHORE COMPANY IS TO OPERATE WITHOUT THE TRANSPARENCY THAT BRITAIN HAS BEEN BILLY WE HAVE A LAW COMING IN THAT WILL REQUIRE
A REVELATION OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF COMPANY BUT THERE IS A VAST AMOUNT TO BE DONE IF WE WANT TO
THE USE OF OFFSHORE COMPANIES AND TRUST SHOULD'VE SUPPORTED TAX SHOULD BRITAIN PUT AN END TO THEM BECAUSE PRESUMABLY IT COULD PARTICULARLY AS FAR AS ITS OVERSEAS TERRITORIES ARE CONCERNED SHOULD IT SAY LOOK NO MORE YOU CAN'T DO THIS ANY LONGER WRITTEN YOU CAN ACT UNILATERALLY BUT THERE ARE THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THESE LITTLE COUNTRIES
ENDOWED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW WITH SOAP ON HE THEY CAN SET UP THEIR OWN REGIMES
UTTER SECRECY WHICH HAVE NO TRANSPARENCY THERE MUST BE SOME FORM I THINK INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION
CAMERON AND MISTER OSBORNE GO ON ABOUT IT FOR YEARS HAVE GONE ON ABOUT IT FOR YEARS AT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES THE PROBLEM
TO AGREE A CONVENTION FIRSTLY REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY SO THAT THE WORLD CONCEIVED
HE'S BEHIND THE COMPANIES THAT ARE WORKING I THINK LAWYERS AS WELL THERE HAS TO BE A RECONSIDERATION
OF THEIR BEAKS THEY HAVE TO BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER DUTIES
KES AND FINALLY THERE HAS TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEMENT BOSIE THAT CAN IN CAN INSPECT RECORDS
AT THE END OF THE DAY PERHAPS
THAT'S CAUGHT TO PUNISH THOSE WHO USE IT
IN ORDER TO AVOID SANCTION GEOFFREY ROBERTSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE PRIME MINISTER MAY REGARD HIS FAMILY'S TAX AFFAIRS AS PRIVATE FOR THE PAPERS BEG TO DIFFER THE GUARDIAN THE TIMES THE DAILY MAIL ALL GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT HOW DAVID CAMERON'S LATE FATHER AVOIDED PAYING U.K. TAX WITH AN INVESTMENT FUND BASED IN THE BAHAMAS THE GUARDIAN POINTS OUT THAT THESE OFFSHORE ANTICS HELP TO PAY THE PRIME MINISTER'S SCHOOL FEES AND SWELL HIS INHERITANCE THE MAIL SAYS THE REVELATIONS ARE BAD NEWS FOR MISTER CAMERON THOUGH THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT HIS FAMILY HAS DONE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
THE RETURN OF THE FIRST GROUP OF MIGRANTS TO TURKEY FROM GREECE UNDER A CONTROVERSIAL Y. YOU DEAL HAS A GUARDIAN WONDERING WHETHER IT'S A BREAKTHROUGH OR BARTERING OF BODIES THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE SCHEME THREATENED TO DESCEND INTO CHAOS HAS BOATS CONTINUE TO MAKE THE PERILOUS JOURNEY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ACROSS THE EDGE IN THE DAILY MIRROR IS ANGRY THAT NETWORK RAIL IS BUYING EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF STEEL A YEAR FROM SPAIN AND AUSTRIA DESPITE THE CRISIS AFFECTING BRITISH PRODUCERS THE COMPANY POINTS OUT THAT NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE STEEL IT BUYS COMES FROM THE U.K. THE MIRROR SAYS IT SHOULD BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT
THE SUN ATTACKS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SARGE A JOB IT IS BUNGLING AND SAYS HE'S HAVING TO QUASH SUGGESTIONS THAT HE'S BEEN SIDELINED BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN A GUARDIAN INTERVIEW LOUISE SCIENCE THE HEAD OF BRITAIN'S SECOND BIGGEST DEAL MAKE A SALSA CRITICISES THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE AND SAYS THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THE INDUSTRY WILL SURVIVE THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
WHICH WAS MUSIC'S GREATEST YEAR IT'S A TRICKY AND PERHAPS UNANSWERABLE QUESTION FORMED BY TASTE MEMORY NOSTALGIA PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN HIS NEW BOOK THE JOURNALIST AND FORMER OLD GREY WHISTLE TEST PRESENTER DAVID HEPWORTH THINKS HE HAS THE ANSWER
YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH MOST OF THESE RECORDS WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY LESS AWARE OF IS THE FACT THAT THEY ALL CAME OUT IN THE SAME YEAR NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
GOOD
PLEASE
THOSE RECORDS WEREN'T JUST HITS AT THE TIME THEY CONTINUED TO SELL TO THIS DAY AND SOME OF THE ARTISTS ARE STILL OUT THERE PERFORMING AND MANY OF THE SONGS THEY PERFORM COME FROM THAT YEAR NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
THE WHO WERE ON TOUR AND THEY ARE PLAIN WHO'S NEXT SONG'S BARBARA RILEY AND WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN ROLLING STONES LAST YEAR DID AT ALL WHERE THEY JUST PLAYED THEN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ALBUM STICKY FINGERS
IS SOMETHING ABOUT THESE RECORDS THE WAY THEY WERE MADE THAT ENDURES TO THIS DAY IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO A LOT OF RECORDS MADE BEFORE
THIS DEMONSTRATION WAS IN AID OF THE WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT FOR POINT PROGRAMME FREE CONTRACEPTIVES UNDER WASHROOM EQUAL EDUCATION AND JOBS EQUAL PAY AND PLENTY FOR OUR NURSERY
DON'T SEVENTY ONE YOU GET THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION FOR WHAT WE CALL WOMEN'S LIBERATION
THANKS VERY MUCH ECHOED IN THE SUCCESS OF CAROLE KING'S TEMPUS
WINTER SPRING
WHICH WAS A RECORD THAT SOLD DISPROPORTIONATELY TO WOMEN PARTICULARLY WOMEN OUT OF THE TEENAGE YEARS COULD SO YOU GET THE RECORD INDUSTRY
STARTING TO EXTEND BEYOND HIS TRADITIONAL AREA AND SELL TO YOUNG ADULTS
RECORDING TECHNOLOGY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WAS JUST MOVING FROM EIGHT TRACK TO SIXTEEN TRICK WHICH MEANT IS AFFORDED MORE SOPHISTICATION
BUT IT WASN'T YET A TALE THAT WAGGED THE DOG AND GAVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENDLESSLY PUT OFF MAKING DECISIONS RECORDS WERE MADE VERY VERY QUICKLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
BECAUSE WE COULD GREAT TRAGEDY IT IS THAT IT'S GOT THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO CONSCIOUSLY RECREATE WHAT THEY DID BY ACCIDENT
WHEN THEY WERE TWENTY EIGHT OR TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD OR YOUNG AND FOOLISH
YOU GET EXTRAORDINARY EVENT THAT STILL RESENT HUNT DOWN THE YEARS LIKE MICK JAGGER'S CHAOTIC WEDDING TO BIANCA JAGGER
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE WHERE YOU SUDDENLY SEE THE EMERGENCE OF THIS MAGNIFICENTLY WEALTHY INTERNATIONAL JET SETTING ROCK SUPERSTAR STRATA OF HIGH SOCIETY IN THE SUMMER YOU GET THE FIRST GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL TO TAKE PLACE UNDER THE NAME GLASTONBURY WHICH THANKFULLY IS BLESSED BY THE FACT THAT THE SUN SHINES AND NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TURN
SO IT PRODUCES BEAUTIFUL IMAGES
OUT OF WHICH GLASTONBURY HAS BLOSSOMED EVER SINCE
SHALL WE TALK ABOUT THE CONCERT REALLY THIS CONCERT IS HERE AND IN THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT IS TO TRY AND HELP SOME PEOPLE HERE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
HE'S ALSO IN AUGUST GEORGE HARRISON PUTS TOGETHER THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE TERRIBLE CIVIL WAR BOB DYLAN TURNS UP ERIC CLAPTON TURNS UP RINGO STARR TURNED UP AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE THIS NEW TEMPLATE
THAT IS STILL USED TO THIS DAY WERE CERTAINLY INHERITED BY ALIVE AYE AND ARE STILL REGULARLY USED TO THIS DAY IT WAS JUST DUMB ABSOLUTELY ON THE HOOF IN NINETEEN SEVENTY
OF COURSE EVERYONE CAN LOOK BACK ON THE YEAR WHEN THEY WERE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FIVE AND SAY THIS WAS THE YEAR WHEN THE MUSIC WAS JUST VERY SPECIAL AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENDURE A
BUT ALSO IT MUST BE THAT ONE OF US ONE OF OUR OPINIONS IS ALSO OBJECTIVELY
I CHALLENGE THEM TO FIND A YEAR THAT RESOUNDS FURTHER THAN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
AH
DAVID HEPWORTH THERE HE EXPANDS ON HIS ARGUMENT IN HIS BOOK NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE NEVER A DULL MOMENT
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN OUR STUDIO THIS ONE IS THE REV DOCTOR SAM WELLS HIS VICAR OF SAINT MARTIN'S IN THE FIELDS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHEN KIM PHILBY GAVE A SEMINAR TO THE EAST GERMAN STAR Z. ON HOW TO BE A SPY HE EXPLAINED HOW HE GOT AWAY WITH HIS ESPIONAGE FOR SO LONG THE GOVERNING CLASSES COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT ONE OF THEIR OWN WAS A SPY AND MANY AN M.I.SIX HAD MUCH TO LOSE IF IT WAS PROVEN
WE ACT IN THE WORLD THAT WE SEE MANY OF US ARE RELUCTANT TO SEE THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS IT'S TOO PAINFUL TOO COMPLICATED TOO DEMANDING SO WE SELECT DIFFERENT FACTS FROM THE WORLD IN FRONT OF US
AND FRAME A VISION AROUND THEM PEOPLE BECOME SO TIED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE VISIONS THAT THEY PRACTICALLY LIVE IN DIFFERENT WORLDS FOR THE WRITER IRIS MURDOCH VIRTUE IS PERCEIVING THE WORLD AS IT REALLY IS DIVESTED OF SELFISHNESS AND SELF INTEREST
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN A SITUATION LIKE THOSE AT M.I. SIX WHERE SOMEONE CLOSE TO THEM WAS UP TO NO GOOD BUT THEY SIMPLY WOULDN'T SEE IT
FOR MURDOCH WE'RE SO ABSORBED IN FANTASY OR CONVENTION THAT WE JUST CAN'T RECOGNISE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WHOLE INSTITUTIONS CAN BECOME SUBJECT TO A CULTURE OF NOT SEEING CERTAIN THINGS WE THINK WE'RE FREE WHEN LIFE GOES WELL BUT IN FACT OUR FREEDOM DEPENDS ON A WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO SEE AND ADAPT TO WHAT DOESN'T FIT OUR VISION PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT AND CHALLENGING OR INFORMATION THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE AND SOMETIMES DISTRESSING
WHEN A COUNSELLOR SITS DOWN WITH A CLIENT THERE GENTLY HELPING THE CLIENT SET THEIR VERSION OF EVENTS ALONGSIDE WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IT CAN BE HARD TO ALIGN THE TWO IT'S NOT JUST M.I. SIX ALL OF US HAVE STRONG RESISTANCE IT'S TO SEEING THINGS THAT DAMAGE A GOOD OPINION OF THOSE WE TRUST
THE CHRISTIAN HOPE IN HER FINAL JUDGEMENT HAS OFTEN BE PORTRAYED AS A GUILT INDUCING CHAMBER OF HORRORS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY LIBERATING IT MEANS THAT ONE DAY ALL THE SECRETS WE HOLD SO TIGHT WILL BE LAID BARE AND WILL BE EMBRACED IN ALL OUR COMPLEX REALITY BY A GOD WHO SEES TRUTH THROUGH THE EYES OF MERCY
SUCH A HOPE IT MEANS WE CAN STOP CONSTRUCTING ARTIFICIAL FANTASIES AND CONVENTIONS AND START LIVING IN THE FOREVER WORLD OF UNSENTIMENTAL REALITY
IT GIVES US CONFIDENCE TO SEE THE FALLIBILITY IN ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT LAPSING INTO A CYNICISM THAT EVERYONE IS UP TO NO GOOD ALL THE TIME
WHEN A COLLEAGUE TURNS OUT TO BE A SPY WE'RE SURPRISED BUT NOT SHOCKED SAD BUT NOT DEVASTATED
FOR CHRISTIANS GOD UNFLINCHINGLY SEES THE REALITY OF US KNOWS ALL OUR SECRETS AND YET DOESN'T GIVE UP ON US HOPE MEANS OUR DOING THE SAME
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR SAM WELLS IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO EAT THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SUCH A JOB IT FLIES TO INDIA TODAY TO MEET TATA STEEL AND DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE PORT TALBOT PLAN PLANT SOMETHING THAT LABOUR SAYS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE EARLIER AND TRY TO PERSUADE TOTTERED NOT TO SELL
BEFORE LEAVING FOR MUMBAI HE'LL MEET THE MAN MANY PEOPLE ARE HOPING MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE THE SAVIOUR OF PORT TALBOT SANJIV GUPTA THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE COMMODITIES FIRM LIBERTY HOUSE WHICH IS A POTENTIAL BUYER OF THE BUSINESS SANJIV GUPTA'S AS IN A RADIO CAR NOW GOOD MORNING
WITH MONEY WHAT STAGE OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS REACHED
THIS IS STILL EARLY DAYS THIS MY FIRST DAY BACK IN THE U.K. SO WE HAVE YET TO ENGAGE FULLY WITH IT ALL STAKEHOLDERS BEING PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SO ON
SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT WE CAN FALL TICKET BUT WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE OBVIOUS ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE PENSION FUND
AND ALSO THE FUTURE OF ITS BLAST FURNACES SO LET'S STOP WITH THE PENSION FUND AT HOW WHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO THE LIABILITY THAT THAT INVOLVES IT IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE WHICH NEEDS TO BE TACKLED BUT FOR US THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES ARE THE ABSOLUTE LIABILITY OF THE BLOOD FIRST
AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES WHICH ARE ALL IMPORTANT WILL BE ADDRESSED SECOND BUT WHEN YOU'VE ALMOST WE WOULDN'T WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE PENSION FUND IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TACKLED WOULD YOU CONSIDER PURCHASING THE PLANT WITH LIABILITY STILL THERE
I'M NOT IN THE POSITION TO ANSWER THAT AS WELL BECAUSE YOU'VE NOT REALLY DONE ANY DUE DILIGENCE ON THE SUBJECT THIS WHOLE WHOLE PROSPECT OF US GETTING INVOLVED OR SOMETHING VERY VERY NEW ALL WE WEREN'T EXPECTING
KIND OF TO ANNOUNCE WE DID THAT QUICKLY SO WE HAVEN'T REALLY BRACED ASSHOLE PREPARING OURSELVES BUT CURRENTLY FIRST FOCUSING ON AS IS A BROAD CONCEPT OF WHAT IS DOABLE THEN WHICH WE'VE OUTLINED
WHICH IS THAT WE FEEL THAT THE ROLLING MILLS AND ALL THAT ANSWERING BUSINESSES AND NOT JUST IN OUR RANGE OF SPECIALIST BUSINESS IS AS SOMEBODY SUGGESTED AND DOCUMENT ALL THE BUSINESS WAS ALL THE STATE SEEMS TO POINT TO TODAY AND POSSIBLY ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS WHICH WE WOULD ADD TO IT ALL OF THAT WE BELIEVE
CAN BE TURNED DON'T MANY OF THE MOST LOST MAKING AT THE MOMENT BUT IF WE CAN BE TURNED ROUND ALL THE DOWN WATERY VENICE NESS'S BUT NOT THE BLAST FURNACES THAT RIGHT WHAT
WHAT WOULD ANYBODY LOOKING AT THIS PROSPECT US OR ANY OTHER BUYER MUST CONTEND WITH THIS WHAT DOES THE WOOD AS A MAIN PROBLEM
OFF THE VIABILITY OF THESE BUSINESSES AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE SEE IS TO BLAST FURNACES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTING ALL THEIR OWN MATERIAL TO MAKE TO SMELT STEEL WE WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION WHICH HAS TO MY STILL NICK HOT METAL BUT TO MAKE IT FROM LOCAL RAW MATERIAL RATHER THAN FROM IMPORTED RAW MATERIAL SO IT'S A CHANGE OF TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN
RATHER THAN ENDING LIQUIDITY MATING AS I HAD THAT IS EDITION WE HAVE BED ABOUT HALF OF THE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE PLANT ARE EMPLOYED ON THE BLAST FURNACES AND THE COKE SIDE SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM
I I WILL NOT GO INTO NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT I HAVE SAID IN CONCEPT ALREADY IS THAT IF WE GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING IN THE U.K. AND CERTAINLY
IN PORT TALBOT WE WILL ONLY DO SO ON THE BASIS THAT WE ARE WE ARE CONFIDENT IT WILL NOT BE ANY MASSIVE NANCIES WE WILL LOOK TO TRANSITION TO PEOPLE WHO WORK ON FOR EXAMPLE WHO WORK ON THE BLAST FURNACE TO OUR FINANCES HAVE ALSO REQUIRES AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AWESOME A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
BUT THAT WEATHER THAT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES MASS REDUNDANCIES AYE ARE YOU IN A POSITION TO SAY THAT YOU COULD RE EMPLOY RETRAIN ALL THOSE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THE SIDE OF THE BUSINESS THAT YOU DON'T THINK HAS A FUTURE
YES ABSOLUTELY THAT WOULD REMIND ANCIENT DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU IF YOU BUY THIS THERE WOULD BE NO REDUNDANCIES AT THE PLANT
THERE WOULD DEFINITELY BE MY OBJECT OF YES WHICH MEANS YOU SEE ENOUGH OF ENOUGH OF A OF A FUTURE FOR ALL THOSE FOUR THOUSAND JOBS TO BE SAFEGUARDED MAKING STEEL IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY ON NO LONGER MAKING NEW STEEL
IN FACT IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY RECYCLING STILL NOW WHEN I SAY THIS PLEASE DON'T ASSUME THAT HIS OVERNIGHT IT WILL TAKE YEARS TO TRY AND MAKE THIS TRANSITION FROM BLAST FURNACES START DAUPHINOISES IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH HAPPENS QUICKLY BUT THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN WHICH HAD SUSTAINED HIM ALONG TO A FUTURE FOR US TO BE
FOR ANYONE WHO WHO WOULD MOURN THE LOSS OF MAKING NEW STEEL AT THIS PLANT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM I THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO INVEST AND WORK IN SOMETHING WHICH WAS SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM
MAKING NEW STEEL AS YOU CALL IT MAKES A DOUBLE DOUBLES OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND DISCOVERED IN THIS COUNTRY IS COMMITTED TO REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT SO TO BEGIN WITH WE ARE TAXING THINGS LIKE ELECTRICITY HEAVILY BECAUSE WE WANT TO PRODUCE A COMMA FOOTPRINT YET THERE IS A WAY OF MAKING STEEL
IN THE U.K. WHICH HAS WHICH HAS A MUCH MORE CARBON FOOTPRINT WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO AT THE MOMENT WE EXPORT A SCRAP AND BRING BACK STEAL WE IMPORT SIX MILLION TONNES OF STEEL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THEM BEEN MADE HAIR SO IT'S NOT JUST OUR COMMITMENT WOULD BE NOT JUST TO PRODUCE WHAT IS CURRENTLY PRODUCE WHAT TO EXPAND PRODUCTION EVENTUALLY IN DUE COURSE YOU SAID AS YOU GET HERE YOU SAID THINGS WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT YOU SOUND VERY VERY POSITIVE WOOD WOULD YOU SAY CHANCES ARE YOU WILL BUY THIS PLANT
NO I CAN'T SAY THAT AT ALL AT THE STAIRS I'VE NOT EVEN ENGAGED WITH THE STEAK ALL THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE U.K. I I BELIEVED IN THE U.K. STILL INDUSTRY WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS IN THAT REGARD WE STARTED A NEW POOR PLANT
THE BOARD COULD BURROW BUSINESSES WE RESTART A LOT OF THOSE WE WATERMARK FURNACE WITH A VIEW TO PUT IT IN NEWPORT TO RESTART THE MILL CHOP DOWN THE MELTING OPERATION THEY'RE MAKING STILL THERE
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT DISC WITH WHAT HIS VISION FOR YOU KRISTIAN WHICH INCLUDES WHICH CAN INCLUDE PORT TALBOT AS WELL SO YOU'VE GOT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
COUPLE OF MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST CHRIS IS BACK WITH US CHRIS AND SEREN THINGS IMPROVING WEATHERWISE THROUGH THE DAY TODAY MANY OF US STARTING OFF ON A CLOUDY NOTE OF A SUNNY SPELLS BREAKING THROUGH ACROSS WALES THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND A LOT OF FINE AND DRY WEATHER WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE DAY TODAY AND FEELING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES BETWEEN TWELVE AND SIXTEEN DEGREES WILL BE ONE OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS SOME OF THESE POPPING UP JUST INLAND FROM THE SOUTH COAST IN DORSET HAMPSHIRE AND WEST SUSSEX BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE A DRY DAY

OR PERHAPS A FANTASY OF THE GLAMOROUS AIR ACE OR THE FRIVOLITY OF THE LAVISH MUSICAL CHU CHIN CHOW JOHNNY FRANCINE STOCK FOR WORLD WAR ONE THE CULTURAL FRONT ON SATURDAY MORNING AT TEN THIRTY ON B. B. C. RADIO FOUR IN THE NEXT HOUR OF THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO STOP INTERNATIONAL TAX EVASION YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE FIFTH OF APRIL THE HEADLINES THE PRIME MINISTER IS BEING URGED TO DO MORE TO TACKLE TAX HAVENS IN BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND INDIAN ENTREPRENEUR HOPING TO BUY PORT ALBERT ANOTHER STILL WORKS IS HOLDING TALKS WITH MINISTERS
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN YOUR PARENTS THAT IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO ROYAL RESIDENCES ARE TO HAVE A MULTI MILLION POUND FACELIFT
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY SUSAN RAE DAVID CAMERON IS COMING UNDER PRESSURE TO DO MORE TO STOP BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND CROWN DEPENDENCIES BEING USED BY WEALTHY PEOPLE TO REDUCE THEIR TAX BILLS THE LEAK OF MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS FROM A PANAMANIAN LAW FIRM HAS REVEALED THE EXTENT OF THE PRACTICE GLOBALLY IT'S A MARRIAGE THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SECRET COMPANY SET UP BY THE LAWYERS MOSS THAT CON SACRE WERE REGISTERED IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
IN A SPEECH LATER TODAY THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CARBON WILL SAY THERE CAN'T BE ONE SET OF RULES FOR THE WEALTHY ELITE AND ANOTHER FOR THE REST OF US HE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
DOWNING STREET SAY THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AHEAD OF THE PACK WHEN IT COMES TO TACKLING TAX AVOIDANCE AND EVASION THEY POINT TO PREVIOUS INITIATIVES BY MY CAMERA AND TO TRY AND ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF TAX HAVENS FORTY CHANGES TO TAX LAW TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND THEIR PRIORITY MISTER CAMERON HAS GIVEN THE ISSUE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE
HOWEVER THERE ARE GROWING CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE TO TACKLE TAX SECRECY AND ALLEGED CORRUPTION IN BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES LAST NIGHT THE FORMER BUSINESS SECRETARY VINCE CABLE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE DIRECT RULE AND SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER GEOFFREY ROBERTSON SAID BRITAIN HAD A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN TACKLING INTERNATIONAL TAX ABUSE
BRITAIN IS AT THE HEART OF HUBBUB INTERNATIONAL TAX AVOIDANCE BY ALLOWING THESE LITTLE PIECES OF M. REMNANTS OF THEM
TO HAVE TECH SECRECY LAWS AND ENABLE OFFSHORE TRUSTS AN OFF SHORE COMPANY IS TO OPERATE WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY
NUMBER TEN HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO BRUSH ASIDE CONTROVERSY OVER MY CAMERON'S LATE FATHER'S TAX AFFAIRS AFTER IT WAS DISCLOSED HE RAN AN OFFSHORE FUND IN THE BAHAMAS A NUMBER TEN SPOKESMAN SAID IT WAS A PRIVATE MATTER
SOURCES ALSO POINTED OUT THAT MY CAMERON OWNS NO SHARES IN ANY COMPANY LATER TODAY HOWEVER THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WILL ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF PAYING LIP SERVICE TO TACKLING TAX ABUSE WHICH HE WILL ARGUE HE'S STARVING PUBLIC SERVICES OF MONEY TAX HAVENS HE WILL SAY HAVE BECOME HONEY POTS OF INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION
LAST NIGHT LARGE CROWDS GATHERED OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT IN REYKJAVIK CALLING FOR THE RESIGNATION OF THE ICELANDIC PRIME MINISTER SIGMUND DUGGAN LUGS AND AFTER DETAILS OF HIS FAMILY'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS WERE REVEALED IN THE PAN IN THE PAPERS HE'S ACCUSED OF HIDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS BEHIND A SECRETIVE OFFSHORE COMPANY
PROSECUTORS IN PANAMA SAY THEY'LL LAUNCH A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO MON SAC FONSECA THE LAW FIRM AT THE CENTRE OF THE DAY TO LEAK THE LATEST REVELATION SURE THAT THE COMPANY HAD CLIENTS WHO WAS SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS IT WORKED WITH THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUALS OR COMPANIES WHO AT SOME POINT FACED ACTION FROM THE U.S. TREASURY INCLUDED COMPANIES LINKED TO NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME AND A CLOSE RELATIVE OF SYRIA'S PRESIDENT ASAD WITH MORE DETAILS HERE SIMON COX
THE LEAKED DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT MOST SAT VON SECKER SET UP A COMPANY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALLED D. C. B. FINANCE BASED IN NORTH KOREA'S CAPITAL PYONGYANG SHORTLY BEFORE THE COUNTRY CONDUCTED ITS FIRST NUCLEAR TEST AND WAS THEN SUBJECT TO U.S. SANCTIONS
BUT MO SACK VON SECKER DIDN'T TAKE ACTION FOR FOUR YEARS UNTIL LATE TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN THEY WERE CONTACTED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THEN STOPPED DOING BUSINESS WITH D. C. B.
MOST LIKE VON SECKER ALSO RAN SIX COMPANIES FOR SYRIA'S WEALTHIEST BUSINESSMEN RUMMY MACHLI'S WHO WAS SUBJECT TO U.S. SANCTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HE WAS ALSO A CLIENT OF H.S.B.C. WHILE HE WAS SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS
MOST LIKE VON SECKER SAID THEY'D NEVER KNOWINGLY ALLOWED THE USE OF THEIR COMPANIES BY INDIVIDUALS HAVING ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA OR SYRIA H.S.B.C. SO THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORITIES TO FIGHT FINANCIAL CRIME AND IMPLEMENT SANCTIONS
THE INDIAN ENTREPRENEUR SANJIV COOKED OUT IS TO MEET THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAINT JAVERT TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE RESCUE PLAN FOR THE PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS MY COOKED TO CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS INTERESTED IN BUYING PART OF THEIR BUSINESS FROM TATA STEEL AND INSISTED STAFF WOULD BE RETRAINED RATHER THAN MADE REDUNDANT HE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT HE BELIEVED PARTS OF THE BUSINESS COULD BE TURNED AROUND BUT THERE HAD TO BE CHANGES
ANYBODY LOOKING AT THIS PROSPECT MUST CONTEND WITH THE WOOD AS A MAIN PROBLEM OFF THE VIABILITY OF THESE BUSINESSES AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE SEE IS TO BLAST FURNACES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTING ALL THEIR OWN MATERIAL TO MAKE TO SMELT
WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION WHICH AS TO MY STILL NICK HOT METAL BUT TO MAKE IT FROM LOCAL RAW MATERIAL RATHER THAN FROM IMPORTED RAW MATERIAL SO IT'S A CHANGE OF TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN
RATHER THAN ENDING LIQUIDITY MATING
IT'S THOUGHT THE FUTURE OF THE TATA STEEL PENSION FUND COULD BE A CRUCIAL PART OF ANY DEAL THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND M.P. FOR SHEFFIELD HALLAM NICK CLEGG SAYS MINISTERS NEED TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR A PROSPECTIVE BUYERS
THERE HAS TO BE SOME GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO LIGHTEN THE BURDEN OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES WERE ANY NEW BUYER I THINK IF YOU
IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT IT'S ALREADY GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A NEW BUYER
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY M.P.S OF CREATING A PERCEPTION THAT IS DOWNGRADED THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE POINTS TO CHINA EGYPT AND SAUDI ARABIA AS COUNTRIES WERE BRITISH MINISTERS APPEAR TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON PROMOTING TRADE AND SECURITY THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND SAYS THE U.K. SUPPORTS OVER SEVENTY FIVE HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECTS IN MORE THAN FORTY COUNTRIES AND AS DOUBLING THEIR FUNDING TO TEN MILLION POUNDS
THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. CRISPIN BLUNT WHO CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE TOLD US MINISTERS HAVE GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ISSUE WAS NOT THE PRIORITY IT WAS UNDER THE PREVIOUS FOREIGN SECRETARY THEY'RE CHANGING THE WAY THEY DO IT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN LANGUAGE NOR CHANGIN SYMBOLOGY WHICH WOULD SUGGEST IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT USED TO BE UNDER WILLIAM HAGUE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REMAINS AS IMPORTANT AS AS IT USED TO BE
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WILL ANNOUNCE THIS AFTERNOON IF IT PLANS TO PRESS AHEAD WITH THE PROSECUTION AGAINST KENYA'S DEPUTY PRESIDENT WILLIAM ROTO ON CHARGES OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY THE ALLEGED OFFENCES RELATE TO THE DEATHS OF TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN VIOLENCE AFTER ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO YEARS AGO THE PROSECUTOR DROPPED A SIMILAR CASE AGAINST THE KENYAN PRESIDENT HOOVER KENYATTA
THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS AND STAFF TAKING LONG TERM SICK LEAVE FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS HAS GONE UP BY A THIRD OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS RESPONDING TO AN INVESTIGATION BY RADIO FIVE LIVE THE HOME OFFICE SAID IT RECOGNISED POLICE WORK WAS STRESSFUL AND HAD ALLOCATED MONEY TO HELP AFFECTED OFFICERS HELEN OR LEAVE REPORTS
THE B.B.C. USED TO FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST TO ACCESS DATA ON LONG TERM SICKNESS LEAVE FROM FORTY OF THE FORTY SIX POLICE FORCES ACROSS THE U.K. THERE WERE JUST OVER SIX THOUSAND CASES OF POLICE EMPLOYEES TAKING TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OR MORE OFF WORK BECAUSE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN
OVERALL LONG TERM SICK LEAVE ALSO WENT UP IN THE SAME PERIOD DESPITE A STEADY DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF POLICE EMPLOYEES THE POLICE FEDERATION WHICH REPRESENTS FRONTLINE OFFICERS SAID CUTS TO OFFICER NUMBERS AND AN INCREASING CRIME HAD LED TO AN OVERSTRETCHED AND OVERWORKED SERVICE
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS JUST ONE PERCENT OF MEN HAVE OPTED TO TAKE SHARED PARENTAL LEAVE IN THE YEAR SINCE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED IT THE POLICY ALLOWS PARENTS TO SHARE UP TO FIFTY WEEKS OF THE FOLLOWING THE BIRTH AND ADOPTION OF THEIR CHILD IF THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA
THIRTY SEVEN WEEKS IS PAID THE MAIN FACTORS FOR THE LOW TAKE UP WAS SAID TO BE FINANCIAL AND AN UNWILLINGNESS OF WOMEN TO SHARE MATERNITY LEAVE THEN BLACK THE FOUNDER OF MY FAMILY CARE WHICH INTERVIEWED A THOUSAND PARENTS AND TWO HUNDRED H. R. DIRECTORS SAYS A LACK OF AWARENESS IS AN ISSUE TOO
THE IDEA OF SHARED PARENTAL LEAVE HIS BEAUTIFUL IN PRINCIPLE BUT IN ACTUALITY IT'S VERY COMPLICATED GET THEIR HEADS ROUND IT SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE DONE PROBABLY THIRD OF EMPLOYERS HAVE REALLY ENGAGED AND PUSHED IT A THIRD HAVE PUT THEIR POLICIES IN PLACE AND ARE KEEPING QUIET AND A THIRD PROBABLY DONE NOTHING AT ALL SO BIG LACK OF AWARENESS AT THE MOMENT
TWO OF THE QUEEN'S OFFICIAL RESIDENCES WINDSOR CASTLE AND THE PALACE OF HOLYROOD HOUSE TO GET A THIRTY SEVEN MILLION POUND MAKEOVER THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON AREAS THAT ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC SIMON JONES REPORTS
MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE VISIT WINDSOR CASTLE IN BERKSHIRE AND HOLYROOD HOUSE IN EDINBURGH EACH YEAR TWENTY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS WILL BE SPENT REDEVELOPING WINDSOR WHICH HAS BEEN HOME TO FOURTEEN MONARCHS THE CASTLE'S GEORGIAN ENTRANCE WHO'LL BE REINSTATED AT THE CAFE WILL BE OPENED IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY UNDERCROFT
TEN MILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO HOLYROOD HOUSE FOR A NEW LEARNING CENTRE AND OPEN UP ITS GROUNDS THE WORKS WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST WITH MONEY RAISED FROM ADMISSIONS TO ROYAL RESIDENCES INCLUDING BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND GIFT SHOP TAKINGS THE PROJECT WILL BEGIN NEXT YEAR WITH THE TRUST PROMISING THE WORK WILL ALLOW VISITORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ENJOY TWO OF THE MOST HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN BRITAIN
ROYAL MAIL IS ISSUING A SPECIAL SET OF STAMPS MARKING THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THERE'LL BE TEN FIRST CLASS STAMPS FEATURING QUOTATIONS FROM THE BARD'S PLAYS AND SONNETS
IT'S TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT STOP PUSSY FOOTING ON TAX DODGING THAT'S WHAT THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WILL TELL THE PRIME MINISTER TODAY HE'S LAUNCHING HIS PARTY'S LOCAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND SAYS THE LEAK OF RECORDS FROM THE PALOMA LAW FIRM MON SAC VON SECKER SHOWS THERE IS ONE RULE FOR THE RICH AND ANOTHER FOR EVERYONE ELSE
SO WHAT COULD BE DONE ABOUT IT THE ANSWER FOR PANAMA WHERE MUST SET VON SECKER IS BASED IS NOT MUCH BUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SECRET COMPANY SET UP BY THE LAW FIRM MORE THAN HALF WERE IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THAT IS A BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY
A LITTLE EARLIER THIS MORNING I SPOKE TO A LAWYER BASED IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS THE B.P.I. DAMN WHY'S HIS HEAD OF LITIGATION IT MARTIN KENNY AND COMPANY I ASKED HIM WHY SOMEONE WOULD NEED AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT WHAT COULD BE A LEGITIMATE REASON
MOST OF THE B. I COMPANIES ARE USED TO HOLD ASSETS OUTSIDE THE BEE WII REASONS FOR DOING THAT CAN BE TO HELP IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE OF
SETS ARE SITUATED IN PERHAPS QUITE DIFFICULT LOCATIONS OR PLACES WHERE THERE'S A DIFFICULT RULE OF LAW I MEAN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE IF YOU WERE WANTING TO
GET INVESTMENT AND DEVELOP A GOLDMINE IN SOMEWHERE PERHAPS INK BIGGEST STAR OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A LOCAL PARTNER WHO PROVIDES THE LICENCE FOR THE GOLD THE GOLD MINE A FUNDER AND THE TECHNICAL TEAM
THE GOLDMINE LICENCE AND POSSIBLY THE LAND CAN BE PUT INTO A P.P.I. COMPANY AND THEN SHARES CAN BE ISSUED TO THE PARTICIPANTS THAT IS
RELATIVELY QUICK AND EASY TO DO IT ALSO GETS YOU INTO HAVING ACCESS TO A CREDIBLE ENGLISH STYLE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE B. BOTH FOR DOING BASICALLY CORPORATE TRANSACTION SUBSEQUENTLY SOLICITING FURTHER FINANCE AND IF THERE ARE ANY DISPUTE SETTLING DISPUTES AS WE HAVE A SOPHISTICATED WELL RESOURCED COMMERCIAL COURT HERE BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T TRUST KOGA STAR AND IF YOUR INVESTORS ARE IN LONDON OR NEW YORK WHY COULDN'T YOU DO THE SAME THING
HIS TAX NEUTRAL IN TERMS OF THE BABY I COMPANY WILL HAVE ALMOST NO TAX LIABILITIES DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT
SO IT IS DOWN TO TAX REASONS ULTIMATELY THAT ENSUED WELL THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT REASON FOR SURE BUT I THINK THAT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN THESE DISCUSSIONS TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TAX EVASION WHICH IS BAD NORMALLY HAS SOME FORM OF DELIBERATE DECEPTION AND
TAX AVOIDANCE WHICH IS A LAWFUL AND B. IS VERY MUCH DERIVES FROM THE ONSHORE TAX CODES WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE IN THE WORLD DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IN CREATING A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHAT YOU'RE ALSO CREATING HIS YES IT MAY BE USED FOR THOSE WHO WERE JUST
WANTING TO PAY AS LITTLE TAX AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN THEY ARE THEY DOING IT BUT YOU'RE CREATING A HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO FOR CRIMINALS FOR TAX EVADERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY SHOULD BE PAYING THE SAME MONEY AS THE REST OF US INTO OUR HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS BUT I
EVADING THAT FOR THE INVADERS THEY HAVE BEEN ON QUITE A LOT TO COUNTER TAX EVASION IT SIGNED TWENTY SEVEN TAX INFORMATION EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS IT HAS GOT A LOT OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND WITH REGULATORY BODIES ONSHORE SO THE DAYS OF TURNING UP WITH A WITH A SUITCASE AND THAT JUST DOES NOT HAPPEN
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME THE BANK FELT HERE IN IF YOU LIVE HERE
BUT ALSO THE BABY AYE IS APPARENTLY THE LARGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF U.K. PROPERTY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE PROP PROPERTY IN THE U.K. THAT IS OWNED OUTSIDE THE U.K. TOP OF THE LIST IS THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
WHY WOULD THAT BE WHY WOULD SOMEBODY WANT TO HOLD PROPERTY IN THE U.K. VIA SOMEWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
WHAT TRADITIONALLY THEY WERE STAMP DUTY ADVANTAGES TO DOING IT IN IN ENGLAND I BELIEVE THOSE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAILED IT ULTIMATELY JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT COMES DOWN TO TURN NEXT
I THINK TAXES TAXES A SIGNIFICANT PART OF IT BUT THAT IS A LEGITIMATE AREA OF COMPETITION INTERNATIONALLY RIGHT IF THE U.K. WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND SAY LOOK DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S NOT FAIR MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THIS COULD THEY CLOSE IT
THE BABY I'VE GOT A HIGH DEGREE OF SELF GOVERNMENT HOWEVER IT IS BRITISH OVERSEAS DEPENDENT TERRITORY SO I SUPPOSE ULTIMATELY COULD DAMN WISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY DOMINIC GRIEVE WHO IS WHO CHAIRS THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY COMMITTEE BUT UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT'S NOT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES SUCH THAT WE COULD
CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS POSSIBLY SHUT DOWN THE WAY THEY OPERATE AS TAX HA'P'ORTH WE COULD ONLY ON ONE OCCASION IN THE RECENT PAST WE INTERVENED AND REMOVED THE SELF GOVERNMENT OF ONE OF OUR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVELS OF CORRUPTION WITHIN GOVERNMENT BUT IT'S A BIT OF A NUCLEAR OPTION JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS THE DEVOLUTION SETTLEMENT TO SCOTLAND IS SOMETHING WHICH HAS TO BE RESPECTED SO THE AUTONOMY OF OUR OVERSEAS TERRITORIES OR SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT AS WELL
AND AS LONG AS THEY ARE CARRYING OUT THEIR GOVERNMENT'S PROPERLY THERE WOULD BE NO PROPER GROUNDS TO INTERVENE WE ARE THERE ULTIMATELY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THEIR DEFENCE IN MOST CASES AND ARE YOU SATISFIED WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOUR ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE WAY THAT THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS WERE OPERATOR
WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL WE USED TO MEET WITH THE OVERSEAS TERRITORIES ATTORNEYS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS EITHER MYSELF OR THE SOLICITOR GENERAL AND HE'S STILL GOES ON AND THE SORTS OF TOPICS THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED WOULD INCLUDE ISSUES AROUND MONEY LAUNDERING AT PROBLEMS OF ENSURING THAT OVERSEAS TERRITORIES WEREN'T USED AS HAVENS FOR TERRORIST MONEY FOR EXAMPLE
AND WERE COMPLETELY COMPLIANT WITH ALL THEIR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS BUT WHAT IS INDEED CORRECT AS THE POINT WAS JUST BEING MADE IS THAT TAXES ARE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND IF PEOPLE WISH TO LOCATE TO AN OVERSEAS LOCATION INCLUDING AN OVERSEAS TERRITORY BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THERE ARE TAX ADVANTAGES BY LOCATING THEIR COMPANY THERE THAT'S A LEGITIMATE THING THERE'S A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU MANAGING YOUR TAX AFFAIRS SO IS TO MINIMISE TAX LOOK LAWFULLY
AND TAX EVASION OR FOR THAT MATTER ALLOWING YOUR BANKING SYSTEM OR FINANCIAL SECTOR TO BE USED TO FACILITATE CRIME OR TERRORISM INDEED AND YOU COULD ARGUE LOOK LONDON'S DOING IT TO THE REST OF EUROPE AND SAY LOOK WE WANT A BENIGN ENVIRONMENT COS WE WANT TO LURE PEOPLE HERE AND THEY'RE JUST DOING THAT TO TO US BUT THEY ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE U.K. AND THERE ARE IT WOULD APPEAR AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS LEGITIMATELY BUT
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TAX REGIME WITH IN THE WAY THAT THE REST OF US CAN'T I MEAN WE PAY OUR TAXES TO FUND HOSPITALS TO FUND THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LIVES HERE AND THEN THERE ARE VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO ENTIRELY WITHIN THE LAW CAN CANNOT CAN AVOID DOING THAT IS THAT ACCEPTABLE IT SOME MORAL QUESTION BUT ULTIMATELY WE LIVE IN THE GLOBALISED MARKET PLACE AND THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING AND WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAT IF YOU HAVE A TAX ENVIRONMENT WHICH PEOPLE FIND ONEROUS
THEY WILL SHIFT ELSEWHERE THEY WILL EITHER SHIFT THEIR TAX AFFAIRS ELSEWHERE ALL THEY'LL SHIFT THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE IT WAS WHAT THE BRAIN DRAIN WAS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH PEOPLE LEAVING THIS COUNTRY TO GO TO THE UNITED STATES SO I THINK ONE HAS TO RECOGNISE THAT WHILST THERE IS A CLEAR DESIRE AND THE NEED TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND TO PREVENT CRIMINALITY OF WHATEVER FORM IT TAKES AND THAT INCLUDES EVASION STRAIGHT EVASION THAT YOU ARE NOT
THE BEST WAY OF ENSURING I SUPPOSE BUT DID PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO GO TO THE BEADY EYES TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT DOMESTICALLY IN TERMS OF TAX WHICH GUARANTEES THAT PEOPLE WISH TO KEEP ALL THEIR TAX AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OR INDEED ANY OTHER EUROPEAN STATE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT AND IT'S PERHAPS WE'VE HAVE JEREMY CORBIN THE LABOUR LEADER SAYING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S GOT TO STOP PUSSY FOOTING AROUND ON TAX DODGING BUT WE ALSO HAD JOHN CALDWELL A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN THIS MORNING SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT LEAVES A LITTLE BIT VAGUE
THE GOVERNMENT LEAVES IT OPEN TO ABUSE AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE CLEARER GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND PEOPLE WOULDN'T MOVE THEIR MONEY OFFS OFFSHORE I MUST SAY THAT I THINK THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT AND INDEED ITS COALITION PREDECESSOR HAS DONE MORE TO CLOSE TAP TAX LOOPHOLES THAN WAS EVER DONE BY LABOUR WHEN THEY WERE IN POWER IN THE THIRTEEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY
IT'S IN FACT BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK BY THE TREASURY TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT YOU DO HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE WE'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS WHICH IS BECAUSE WE PREVENT THEM FROM PROVIDING BANKING SERVICES AT ALL THEN WE'RE GOING TO DESTROY THE LIVELIHOOD OF ITS INHABITANTS SO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS ENCOURAGING OVERSEAS TERRITORIES
TO FIND LEGITIMATE WAYS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS UNDOUBTEDLY HAD SUCH A LEGITIMATE METHOD SO I'VE JUST AS IT HAS BEEN FOR SWITZERLAND OR ANY OTHER UPS BUT ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT CAME UP FROM MON SAC VON SECKER I YOU QUITE I MEAN WHEN WE WERE TALKING A LOT OF STUFF HAS GONE ON AND PAN AM A LOT OF IT IS DODGY BUT IT ALSO SHINES A LIGHT ON A HOLE
OTHER AREA THAT IT IS ENTIRELY LEGAL BUT PEOPLE WOULD RAISE THEIR EYEBROWS ABOUT ARE YOU SAYING LOOK THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS WE'VE GOT TO ACCEPT IT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE WAY IT IS IF PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT WE CAN ALWAYS ENACT LEGISLATION DOMESTICALLY OR TO TRY TO CHANGE OUR LAWS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SHOULD WE DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD
WE NEED TO CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING THAT FIRSTLY IF WE WERE TO FOLLOW WITH A SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY REMOVE THE AUTONOMY OF OVERSEAS TERRITORIES TO RUN THEIR LAWFUL FINANCIAL SERVICES I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE ACTING PROPERLY TOWARDS THEM THEY ARE ENTITLED TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON THIS SECONDLY BUT HE'S ALSO GOT TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE WAY THAT HUMAN SOCIETY WORKS
WHAT WILL IN FACT HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE WILL GO TO OTHER HAVENS WHICH MAIN FACT HAVE FAR LESS GOOD REGULATION SO WHAT WE WOULD IN FACT BE ENCOURAGING IS THE VERY MONEY LAUNDERING AND CRIMINALITY THAT WE WANT TO SUPPRESS YOUR KNOW THAT THE PAPERS
ALMOST ENTIRE EVERY SINGLE PAPER THIS MORNING HE'S ASKING THE QUESTION OF THE PRIME MINISTER DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY MONEY STASHED IN A SECRET OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN THAT'S THE QUESTION ACROSS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR AND OTHERS THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS IT'S A PRIVATE MATTER
IS IT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER WHETHER HE HAS MONEY IN AN OFFSHORE CENTRE BUT I'D UNDERSTOOD HE'D SAID HE HAD NO SHARES IN OFF SHORE COMPANY SEWED THAT WOULD APPEAR TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IS IT A PRIVATE MATTER
I THINK THAT WITH PUBLIC FIGURES ULTIMATELY ARE WE DO WE DO HAVE A NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND THAT WE HAVE A REGISTER OF INTERESTS AT THE PARLIAMENT WHERE WE ARE OBLIGED TO SET OUT VERY CLEARLY AREAS OF OUR FINANCIAL INTERESTS WHICH GO WAY BEYOND WHAT ORDINARY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE TO DO AND I'M ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT DOMINIC GRIEVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT DON CH EAGLE IS ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S MOST RECOGNISABLE ACTORS THANKS TO A TWENTY NINE YEAR CAREER THAT INCLUDED ROLES IN OCEAN'S ELEVEN CRASH TRAFFIC AND HOTEL RWANDA FOR WHICH HE WAS NOMINATED FOR A BEST ACTOR OSCAR HIS NEW FILM HE'S MILES AHEAD ABOUT THE JAZZ LEGEND MILES DAVIS IN WHICH HE PLAYS DAVIS AS WELL AS DIRECT
HIS CO STAR EWAN MCGREGOR PLAYS A JOURNALIST WHO MANAGES TO INTERVIEW MILES DAVIS DURING A RECLUSIVE PERIOD IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE FILM WAS MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING AND WHEN I MET DON SHEETAL I ASKED HIM WHY
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX MILES AND THAT IS IN THE ROCK'N'ROLL HALL OF FAME AND THEY'RE ATTACKING TO HIS NEPHEW THEY ASKED VINCE AND IF THEY WERE EVER GOING TO DO A MOVIE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S LIFE HE SAID YEAH DAD SHE WAS GOING TO
PEOPLE SAW A COLONY AND SEE HOW WE GET EACH GAS TOGETHER FIGURE OUT THIS IS GOING TO WORK
I MET WITH THE FAMILY AND THEY PITCHED ME SOME IDEAS AND I WASN'T REALLY INTO THEIR IDEAS AND THEN I PITCHED THEM
SOMETHING CRAZY HERE AND THERE ARE MORE WILD THAN WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE MORE INNOVATIVE PERIOD OF MILES DAVIS LIFE DID YOU CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON AS A PERIOD IN THE SEVENTIES ARE NOT AN EASY PERIOD IN HIS LIFE
NO UM NO ANOTHER ANY OF THEM ARE PARTICULARLY EASY BUT THAT ONE WAS DEFINITELY
WASN'T MAKING MUSIC SO TO ME AGAIN LISTENING TO MILES IN MY HEAD AND THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE IT AND SORT OF HIS APPROACH TO EVERYTHING HE DID
THAT FELT LIKE PLAIN WHAT'S NOT DAY WHICH IS WHAT MYLES ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT
WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE OF MAKING THE FILM LIKE FOR YOU THE ACTING THE DIRECTING BUT ALSO YOU PLAY THE TRUMPET
I DO PLAY IN IT BUT WE ARE USING MILES SOUND WORDS MILES DEFINITELY AND WE ASK
PLEASE NOT JUST FROM THE MILES PARTS IN THE MOVIE WITH JULIA AS WELL BUT YEAH I DID LEARN THE SOLOS AND I DID LEARN HOW TO PLAY TRUMPET
LIKE I DIDN'T SAY I PLAY TRUMPET WHEN I'M GOING TO TRUMPET PLAYER HE'S A BIG
YOU SAID AT ONE POINT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING THE FILM AND GETTING THE FINANCING THAT AT ONE POINT IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT
HAVING A WHITE ACTOR IN THE MOVIE WAS A FINANCIAL IMPERATIVE WHAT DID YOU MEAN JUST THAT THAT THAT MADE EVERYTHING GIRL I MEAN IT COULD HAVE PUT PARENTHESES AROUND WHITE AND I COULD HAVE SAID
INTERNATIONAL SOMEONE THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT
TO AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR I COULD HAVE PROBABLY CAST A CHINESE ACTOR IF I WAS GOING TO GET CHINESE MONEY BUT JUST ME AND MILES DAVIS THE MUSIC WAS LOUD
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE WHOLE OSCAR SO WHITE CONTROVERSY AT THE START OF OF THIS YEAR WAS THIS A LONG OVERDUE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN THIS INDUSTRY FOR SO MANY YEARS
I MEAN AND IT'S BEEN SOME YEARS IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IN SOME YEARS IT DOESN'T THE DIVERSITY IN THE ACADEMY IS REPRESENTED BUT I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE YEARS IT IS NOT BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT'S BEING LARDED
IT'S REALLY FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE QUESTION IT'S ABOUT WHAT'S BEING GREENLIT
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEING EVEN BEFORE THE GREENLIT DECISION WHO'S BEING DEVELOPED TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN SIT IN THOSE CHAIRS TO GREEN LIGHT A FILM AND THAT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHO'S GOING TO WALK ACROSS THE STAGE AND GET TO SAY THANK YOU AND GRAB A PIECE AND THAT
GOING BACK TO YOU MILES AHEAD WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU'VE DIRECTED A FEATURE FILM WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN
I PROBABLY WOULD I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD DO IN THE SAME FASHION
A FEW YEARS AGO I TRIED TO GIVE THE JOB AWAY A LITERALLY TRIED TO HIRE ANOTHER DIRECTOR
BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE SO ON ICE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT AND THANKFULLY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT DURING THE PROCESS IT WAS
VERY VERY STRESSFUL LAND YEAH THERE WAS A LOT OF PORPOISES AND TRY TO BE IN
THE EXPERIENCES AND STEP OUT AND HAVE SORT OF THAT TEN THOUSAND BUT PROSPECTIVE DIDN'T DECIDE WHAT COLOUR COLOURS SHOULD BE WHICH FORK WE SHOULD USE
AS WELL AS TRYING TO KEEP MY EYE ON THAT THE CHARACTER AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NECESSARY ACCOMPLISHES SPIRES A STORY WYATT FROM AN ACTING STEP AYE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE THOUGHT ABOUT WHEN WE WROTE THE SCRIPT WHAT DO YOU THINK MILES DAVIS HIMSELF WOULD MAKE OF THE FINAL WITH
WELL ACCORDING TO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSE TO MY THAT I'VE SPOKEN WITH THAT THING THEY THINK YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE IT I MEAN LIKE I SAID HE IS ON RECORD
TALKING ABOUT OTHER FILMS THAT DEAL THAT SPECIFICALLY MUSICIANS THAT DEAL
NOT A GRAVE ALIKE LIKE YOU'RE STUDYING FOR A POP QUIZZERS SO YOU CAN GO TO DINNER BED AND SAY I KNOW IT HE DIDN'T IT I KNOW HE DIDN'T SEND THIS IS HE HEARS HOPIN WAS WATSON
DARING TO BE DIFFERENT AND PUSHING THAT ENVELOPE AND DEER AND NO MISTAKES THERE ARE ENOUGH AND EVERYTHING HE SAID AND EVERYTHING
THAT HE COMMUNICATED TO THE PEOPLE THAT HE WORKED WITH IN THE WAYS THAT HE WANTED THEM TO WORK HERBIE HANCOCK SAYS THAT YOU KNOW MILES PAID THEM TO REHEARSE IN FRONT OF PEOPLE I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY WAS
LET'S SEE WHAT FIGURE IT OUT WE'RE GOING TO JUMP OFF A LEGEND ABOUT THE FALL WILL BE SOMETHING WE'LL FIGURE OUT KEEP ON THE WAY DOWN IN THE LEA EVERYBODY MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED BUT MOST OF US ARE GOING TO PLEA AYE WHEN WE HIT IN SURVIVE THIS DAY PERHAPS THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS SHOULD LEARN FROM HIM
WELL WE'LL SEE FROM YOUR LIPS DON'T WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
A FABULOUS SOUND OF MILES DAVIS AND MILES AHEAD DIRECTED BY AND STARRING DON TOODLE OPENS IN U.K. CINEMAS ON APRIL THE TWENTY SECOND IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND ROB BONNET IS HERE UP THANKS SARAH HELLO AGAIN WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM ONE FORMER CHELSEA PLAYER CHRIS SUTTON HE SAYS THAT HE THINKS THE APPOINTMENT OF ANTONIO CONTAINERS THE CLUB'S MANAGER MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT REPUTEDLY TOO HEAVY HANDED ON MATTERS OF PLAYER DISCIPLINE SUGGEST ITSELF
TO A DIFFERENT VIEW NOW FROM ANOTHER FORMER PLAYER ANDY TOWNSEND HE SAYS CONNED HIS REPUTATION AS A POSITIVE AND HAS ECHOES OF THE MARINE YO STYLE I DON'T THINK IN MANY WAYS AND I WILL BE SO FAR REMOVED FROM WHAT JOE'S OH WAS THAT HIS BEST
HE'S A DISCIPLINARIAN HAS TO BE DONE HIS WAY AND ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT'S WHY JOE'S A. IMMEDIATELY CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE PLAYERS WHEN HE ARRIVED AT STAMFORD BRIDGE IS COS IT WAS THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW THERE WAS AN INTENSITY ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING AND I FEEL THAT ANTONIO CONCERT WILL BE THE SAME AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD APPOINTMENT DO AND HE TURNS INTO THE NEWS THAT BOX AT NICK BLACKWELL IS OUT OF HIS INDUCED COMA HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY HIS OPPONENT OF TEN DAYS AGO CHRIS EUBANK JUNIOR JUNIOR WHO SAYS HE'D LIKE TO VISIT BLACKWELL IN HOSPITAL
WE'RE FAMILIAR MAYBE WITH THE MOTORSPORT ARE RALLYING MONTE CARLO AND ALL THAT BUT RALLY CROSS WELL IMAGINE IF YOU WERE MADE FOR T. V. EVENT BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SOUPED UP CARS RACING SEVERAL LAPS AROUND OF DIRT AND TARMAC CIRCUIT ADD TO THAT A POINTS SYSTEM HAD A SERIES OF VENUES AND YOU HAVE THE F.I.A. WORLD RALLY CROSS CHAMPIONSHIP WHICH STARTS ON APRIL SIXTEENTH IN PORTUGAL AND LIAM DORAN IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S LEADING DRIVERS WELCOME IN
IN ONE OF THESE CAST CAN REALLY SHIFT CAN'T THEY NOUGHT TO SIXTY IN TWO SECONDS INDEED YEAH VERY FAST THAT IS AMAZING IT WHAT ABOUT THE G. FORCE IN A CART THAT QUICK IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE ACTUALLY WHO DID THE CARS ARE RIDICULOUSLY FAST THERE ARE SOME OF THE FORCE IS MUCH MORE CARS AROUND HE'S A MISCHIEVOUS QUESTION IS THIS REALLY
A SERIOUS SPORT OR IS IT JUST THE BOY RACERS HAVE UNDERSTOOD WILL RISE AT HEART REALLY BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SERIOUS SPORT WE'LL TRY AND DO IT FOR GOOD REASONS SO JUST HOW SERIOUS DOES IT GET AT THE LEVEL THAT I'M RACING THAT NOW LIKE YOU SAID THE F.I.A. WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP IS ONE OF ONLY A FIVE CHAMPIONSHIPS IN WORLD MOTOR SPORT WAS CATEGORISED BY THE F.I.A. SO IT'S
IT'S RIGHT AT THE TOP LEVEL OF MUCH MORE NOW AND RUN ACROSS THE SPORT HAS BEEN GROWING A LOT NOT YOU SAID YOU HAD TO INTRODUCE IT TO THE LISTENERS IT'S GROWING A LOT AND
IT'S NOT AS WELL KNOWN AS LIKE LIKES RALLY LEFT ONE BUT IT'S CATEGORISED THE SAME LEVEL IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF BUT STILL TRYING TO HAVE FUN SO TELL ME HOW DO THE REQUIRED SKILLS IN RALLYCROSS DIFFER FROM THOSE OF RALLYING OR EVEN F. ONE THEN OBVIOUSLY DRIVING DRIVING A RACE CAR IS
IS SIMILAR NO MATTER WHAT YOU DOING WITH IT IT'S A MATTER OF CAR CONTROL I'M GOING AS FAST AS YOU CAN BUT IN RALLYCROSS SPECIFICALLY THE RICES ARE VERY SHORT AND FOUR LAPS OR SOMETHING I'M OUT THREE OR FOUR MINUTE RACES WHICH IS HIS SPRING RACING SO THE MEN TO SHE REQUIRES QUITE DIFFERENT TO THAT OF RALLYING LEFT ONE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET
EVERYTHING DOWN IN ACTUAL MATCH ON THERE'S NO THERE'S NO TIME FOR THEIR STRATEGIES ARE MESSING AROUND SO IT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF I SUPPOSE PASSION TO EAT READY TO GO WHEN YOU NEED TO GO
RATHER THAN HOLD FAR AM BIDH PATIENTS THAT SO IT'S A DIFFERENT TIE THAT WAS PASSION NO DOUBT WILL PRODUCE A CRASH OR TWO HOW DOES THE SPORT SAFETY RECORD MEASURE UP IT'S A DRAMATIC SPORT TO SAY THE LEAST DRAMATIC SPORT TO WATCH FOR THE DRIVERS AND FOR THE VIEWERS AND SO ON YEAH ACCIDENTS HAPPEN AND YOU'VE HAD SOME I'VE HAD SOME INDEED ONE
ONE PROBABLY SOME ENGINE BE ONE AT MY HOME CIRCUIT IN KENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WERE ADDED NINE TEN BARRELS IN THE FIRST CORNER SO

DAVID CAMERON IS COMING UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES BEING USED AS TAX HAVENS RESPONDING TO THE LEAK OF MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS REVEALING WIDESPREAD TAX AVOIDANCE AMONG THE RICH JEREMY CARBON SAID MANY TAX HAVENS HAD BECOME HONEY POTS OF CORRUPTION
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THE APPEARANCE THAT IT ISN'T PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS AS IT USED TO IT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT SEEM HESITANT ABOUT DEFENDING RIGHTS OPENLY AND ROBUSTLY
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY IF IT PLANS TO PRESS AHEAD WITH THE PROSECUTION AGAINST KENYA'S DEPUTY PRESIDENT WILLIAM MAROTO HE DENIES CHARGES OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE OUTSIDE THE ICELANDIC PARLIAMENT LAST NIGHT AS A HUGE PROTEST TOOK PLACE DEMANDING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S SIGMUND A GOOD STEP DOWN AFTER ALLEGATIONS IN THE PAN AM PAPERS THAT HE CONCEALED INVESTMENTS IN AN OFFSHORE COMPANY AROUND TEN PER CENT OF THE ENTIRE ICELANDIC POPULATION IS NOW SIGNED A PETITION CALLING
FOR HIM TO GO AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY SEA DOVE IT'S DAUGHTER WHOSE ICELANDIC JOURNALIST AND ALSO BY BIG EATER YOU'RE AN M.P. AND HEAD OF THE PIRATE PARTY WAS ONLY FOUNDED IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT NOW POLES AS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OPPOSITION PARTIES IN THE COUNTRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING SEQUINED OTHER DOT AS YOU LOOK AT THESE PROTESTS AND THIS PETITION HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO GO
WELL IT SEEMED THIRD THE OTHER COALITION PARTY THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY IS SORT OF HAS A TAPING IN PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNMENT SO IT SEEMS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IS LOW SIX SUPPORT AND THAT WOULD SPELL THE END OF THIS GOVERNMENT BUT FAILING THAT HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO RESIGN OR OF HIS OWN VOLITION AND IN THE FACE OF ALL OF THIS KIND OF OPPOSITION
WELL HE WAS ASKED FOR HER MANY QUARTERS YESTERDAY TO RE SIGN AND HE HASN'T DONE THAT SO FAR BUT IF HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF HIS OTHER
PART NO HE HAS NO POWER HE WOULD BEFORE STAR BET TODAY IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING DAY AND THEIR HISTORY OF ICELAND THE POLITICS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT A BIG EATING YON STUTTER PRESUMABLY INDEED THAT IS IN THE OPPOSITION ARE GOING TO USE THIS AGAINST HIM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
THE FINANCE MAN ACTOR SO AND PAPER SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CARRY ON BUT AS FAR AS THE PRIME MINISTER'S CONCERNED AND IT'S AN OFFSHORE COMPANY CALLED A WIND TRIS WOULD SHE OWNED WITH HIS WIFE WITH WHICH HAS BEEN THE FOCUS AND HE SAYS NO RULES WERE BROKEN AND THIS HIS AND THAT HIS WIFE DIDN'T BENEFIT FINANCIALLY HE SOLD HIS FIFTY PER CENT STAKE TO HER
HONESTLY A SEQUENCED OTHERS DUTCH I WONDER IF THAT RECENT HISTORY IN ICELAND IN THE TREMENDOUS SHOCK OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BANKS TO DOES THAT MAKE ALL OF THIS MUCH MORE TOXIC FOR THE PRIME MINISTER
YES PEOPLE HAVE MUCH LESS PATIENTS WITH OFFICER ACCOMPANY THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT ICELAND STAMP IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST AFTER YOUR EYES CAN'T COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE THE BANKS READ VERY DELICATE
IN SELLING THIS SOLUTION TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OF ALL AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR IN OTHER COUNTRIES WOULDN'T REALLY HAVE HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT I MEAN IT WAS SORT OF LIKE YOU KNOW THE LATEST ACCESSORY IN ICED LAND TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE BANKS IN AUTUMN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
AND ICELAND HAS THEN END THEIR LAST TWO YES IN FIGHTING TOGETHER WITH ALWAYS IGGY AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND ORGANISATIONS AGAINST SECRECY AND TAX HAVENS SO IT DOESN'T REALLY I'M WELL WITH THE FIRE

GRAHAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH GRAHAM WILL WANT TO MOVE EITHER END THAT I WAS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHEN DID EXTREMIST ISLAMIST IDEAS INCLUDING FIGHTING A HOLY WAR OR JIHAD ARRIVED IN BRITAIN THE B.B.C. IN THE TIMES HAVE UNCOVERED AN ARCHIVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT SUGGEST AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY THREE WAS A KEY MOMENT
THAT IS WHEN A PAKISTANI PREACHER CALLED MASUD AS HER VISITED THE U.K. GREETED BY MEMBERS OF THE DEAL BUNDY MOVEMENT WHICH ONE'S NEARLY HALF OF ALL U.K. MOSQUES TODAY MARCIA DOES HER HE'S WANTED BY THE INDIAN AUTHORITIES AFTER AN ATTACK ON ONE OF ITS MILITARY BASES EARLIER THIS YEAR WE JOINED NOW FROM A LEEDS STUDIO BY ANDREW NORFOLK THE TIMES CHIEF INVESTIGATIONS REPORTER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE THE DOCUMENTS SHOW ABOUT WHAT HE PREACHED WHILE HE WAS HERE
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR MISINTERPRETATION BRUNO NEW ANSWERS THIS IS THIS IS
A TOUR THAT WAS TO DELIVER FORTY TWO SERMONS ON JIHAD IN
THIRTY TWO DAYS HE WAS TAKEN AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM LONDON
YORKSHIRE TO LANCASHIRE TO BIRMINGHAM HE PREACHED HATRED OF CHRISTIANS JEWS AND HINDUS AND HE PREACHED THE GLORY OF MURDERS COMMITTED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR LAW AND CRITICALLY HE WAS URGING HUNDREDS OF YOUNG BRITISH MUSLIMS
TO BE TRUE TO THEIR FAITH BY GOING TO PAKISTAN TO TRAIN TO RECEIVE WEAPONS TRAINING IN TERROR CAMPS IN PAKISTAN AND FOR YOU THAT THE KEY THING IN ALL OF THIS IS IS THE FACT THAT HE WAS HOSTED BY THE BY THE DEAL BUNDY'S WHICH WHICH I HAVE SUCH A CONTROL OVER SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF BRITISH MOSQUES ABSOLUTELY THE PERCEPTION UNTIL NOW IS THAT IN THOSE DAYS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FRINGE RADICAL SO LAUGHY LINKED ARAB EXILES
THIS WAS MAINSTREAM THIS WAS THE THE MOVEMENT WHICH CONTROLS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED OF BRITAIN'S SIXTEEN HUNDRED MOSQUES IT TRAINS MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF BRITISH TRAINED ISLAMIC SCHOLARS
IT WAS THE SENIOR LEADERS OF THAT MOVEMENT WHO WENT TO HEATHROW IN AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO MEET MISTER IT IS THEY TOOK HIM AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY TREATED HIM AS A HERO OF ISLAM WHEN YOU SAY SENIOR LEADERS HOW SENIOR WHOEVER THE MAN HE MET DURING THAT TOUR INCLUDED USE OF MY THALER HE IS THE FOUNDER OF
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DE BANDY SEMINARY IN BRITAIN IN BURY IN GREATER MANCHESTER HE'S BEEN DESCRIBED BY ONE ADMIRE IS THE POPE BRITAIN'S DAY ABOUT THESE DEB DEB DEB IT'S ALSO HAVE A MISSIONARY GLOBAL MOVEMENT TABLEY JUMART LEADER OF TABLEY JIM OUT IN BRITAIN AND EUROPE WAS AMONG THOSE WHO MET HIM THESE WERE THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE
A VERY SENIOR IN THAT MOVEMENT WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE AT THESE THIRTY TWO SERMONS TO WHAT EXTENT WAS WAS VIOLENCE ARE PART OF ALL OF THEM WAS IT A FLAVOUR OF ALL OF THEM AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE AS YOU WELL KNOW THE CONCEPT OF JIHAD IN ISLAM IT MEANS STRUGGLE AND IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT IS PURELY A STRUGGLE WITH YOURSELF
THAT IS INDEED AN INTERPRETATION THAT IS WIDELY USED FOR MONSIEUR DESIRE THAT IS NONSENSE FOR MY
THE KORAN AND HE HE SAYS IN ONE SERMON THAT WAS ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO YOUNG MUSLIMS WOULD A BOARDING SCHOOL IS ABOUT
INTERPRETING THE WORD JIHAD TO MEAN FIGHTING TO MEAN MURDERS COMMITTED FOR THE SAKE OF A LOT OF THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE TOPIC OF ONE OF HIS SERMONS WHERE HE TELLS HIS YOUNG AUDIENCE THAT LARGE SECTIONS OF THE QUR'AN ARE DEVOTED TO MURDERS FOR THE SAKE OF
THE PROFIT THERE WAS NO INTERNAL MENTAL STRUGGLE GOING ON THERE THAT IS KILLING
AND WHAT DO THE DAY BUNDY A U.K. LEADERSHIP SAY TODAY ABOUT THIS WELL WE APPROACHED YOU SOME ATTILA AND THE DAY BUNTY SEMINARY IN BURY
THEY HAVE NOT DENIED THAT THIS MAN WHO WOULD GO ON TO BECOME THE HEAD OF A GLOBALLY DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANISATION VISITED THEIR SEMINARY AMONG MANY OTHER DEER BUNDY LOCATION
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE HE SAID THEY WERE HELPLESS TO PREVENT SUCH TERRORISTS IN THOSE DAYS
HE SAID HE OPPOSES EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR AS IN THE SEMINARY
AND INDEED IT IS THE CASE THAT THE DAY ABOUT THE MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE FAITH IN ITS BIRTHPLACE IN INDIA AND HERE IN BRITAIN SAYS IT'S COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM THAT IS PERHAPS WHY IT IS SO DISTURBING THAT WHAT THE B.B.C. HAS FOUND THE DOCUMENTS WRITTEN IN IN KARACHI WHICH SAY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING
ANDREW NORFOLK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THERE'S MORE ON THIS STORY STRAIGHT AFTER THIS PROGRAMME BECAUSE THAT'S ONE WILL HAVE HER OWN BENNETT JONES PROGRAMME LOOKING AT THE DOER BUNDY'S ISLAMIC NETWORK THAT RUNS AND NEARLY HALF OF BRITISH MOSQUES THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
A SINGLE SET OF RULES AND GOVERNS ALL OF LIFE FROM THE WAY OUR CELLS WORK THEIR WAY WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS INTERACT THAT'S THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST EMINENT BIOLOGISTS SEAN BE CAROL IN HIS BOOK THE SEREN GET HE RULES THE QUEST TO DISCOVER HOW LIFE WORKS AND WHY IT MATTERS WELL HE JOINS US HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
THIS IS WHAT ONE UNIFYING THEORY OF BIOLOGY ONE WONDERED HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WELL IT'S IT'S ALL CULMINATION OR SOME UNDERSTANDING SOME DIFFERENT REALMS SO WE'VE SPENT
MAYBE FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE HUMAN BODY WORKS WE'VE SPENT ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME FROM YOU HOW NATURE WORKS ON A LARGER SCALE AND THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE RULES THAT REGULARLY HOW WE CONTROL GOES ON OUR BODIES AND HOW
NATURE IS CONTROLLED THERE'S A REALLY ANALOGY IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME RULES AT THOSE DIFFERENT SCALES BUT IT'S A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD
FRESH WAY SO GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN COMPARE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE VERY MICRO LEVEL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING THE MACKEREL THIS'LL SOUND A LITTLE BIT DARK BUT CANCER IN OUR BODIES IS DUE TO THE BREAKAGE OF REGULATION THINGS THAT NORMALLY KEEP IN CHECK THE NUMBER OF CELLS AND OUR BODY IF YOU LOOK AT A LAKE THAT'S CHOKED WITH ALGAE REALLY THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED THAT YOU HAVE ONE TAPIR SPECIES GREEN ALGAE THAT HAVE OVERGROUND THE CONTROLS THAT ARE NORMALLY THERE ARE THAT KEEP THINGS IN CHECK SO WE CAN GET CANCER
THE WORLD CAN GET CANCER SO WHAT HOW'D IF WE THINK OF THEM AS SIMILAR OR WE SEE THESE PARALLELS CAN WE USE THAT IS THERE IS A BIGGER SIGNIFICANT THAT'S THE ARGUMENT IS SORT OF A MEDICAL THINKING SO THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK IS REALLY TO SORT OF BUILD UP HER CONFIDENCE FIRST AND STORIES FOR HER MEDICINE WHICH HAVE BEN
I'LL FIGURE OUT THE RULES AND A BODY AND THEN REALLY TARGETING THERAPY TO THE GREAT SUCCESSES THEY TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK URGH AH NEW TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CANCER AND THE STATINS WHICH EXPLOIT RULES WE FIGURED OUT ABOUT CHOLESTEROL REGULATION AND OUR BODIES TO REALLY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED CARDIAC HEALTH
IN NATURE IT'S ABOUT FIGURING OUT THE RULES AND WHAT PLAYERS MIGHT BE MISSING FROM A GIVEN PLACE OR WEPT LINKAGES HAD BEEN BROKEN IN TRYING TO STEP IN AND REPAIR THOSE OH KAY AND THE REASON THEY CALLED THE SEREN GETTY RULES IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING LOOK HERE SOMEWHERE WHERE VERY OBVIOUSLY THEY APPLY THAT'S RIGHT I USE THE SEWING AT FIRST COS I WENT THERE AND HE WAS INSPIRED TO WRITE THE BOOK PRETTY MUCH BY GOING IN THE SEARING ANY BUT TO USE THE STORY STORYBOOK ANIMALS OF THE SEARING ANY TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THESE RULES OPERATE BUT THEY OPERATE EVERYWHERE
A BLADE OF RICE IS A LITTLE MINI SEARING GABY A BACKYARD PINE AS A MINI SEREN GEDDY EVERYWHERE WHERE YOU HAVE GREENERY THINGS EAT THE GREENERY AND THINGS THAT EAT THE THINGS THAT EAT THE GREENERY YOU'VE GOT A SEARING GOING BUT IN A WAY WE'VE SORT OF KNOWN THAT FOR SOME TIME HAVEN'T YOU KNOW EVER SINCE ONE OF THE TOADS IN NOSTRIL IF YOU REMOVE A PREDATOR
YOU CREATE A PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN CREATE HUGE PROBLEMS I THINK THAT THE PIECE THE SCOPE OF THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE STILL CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE THEIR PREDATORS CAN HAVE SUCH A HUGE IMPACT INDIRECT EFFECTS ON A SYSTEM WE KNOW THIS FROM
PLACES LIKE THE PACIFIC COAST IN ARF ARF OF NORTH AMERICA WE KNOW THIS NOW FROM FOR EXAMPLE THE REMOVAL OF SHARKS IN THE OCEAN THAT THERE'S RIPPLE EFFECTS IT REACH FAR AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE CAR IN THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL SO THAT WHAT YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE IF WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RULES WE CAN BETTER PROTECT THE PLANET ABSOLUTELY IN THIS IS THAT I JUST MAKING THE PLACE PRETTY IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT FUNCTIONAL IT'S ABOUT MAKING OUR
LAKES AND RIVERS AND STREAMS IN FIELDS MORE PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SUPPLY OUR DOMAINS WE HAVE SO MANY GLOOM STORIES ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT WE'RE DOING TO OUR PLANET BEING REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC OR AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOME LIGHT MOMENTS YEAH I COULDN'T WRITE THE BOOK UNLESS I WAS OPTIMISTIC AND THE REASON I'M MADNESS AGAIN THEN SOME PLACES HAVE EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC RECOVERY WE'RE GROWING NATIONAL PARK IN MOZAMBIQUE BUT ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT NATURE IS INCREDIBLY RESILIENT IN PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN PROTECTED OR SPECIES THEY'VE BEEN PROTECTED
THEY'VE COME ROARING BACK IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE FEWER THAN A THOUSAND LARGE ANIMALS LEFT IN THIS PARKIN IN MOZAMBIQUE TODAY THERE ARE SEVENTY THOUSAND SO NATURE IS INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE AND GIVEN A CHANCE WHICH MEANS A LITTLE TIME AND THEIR PROTECTION AND WELCOME YOU ALL AND A FEW PEOPLE WORKING VERY HARD THEN YOU DEDICATED PEOPLE WORKING VERY HARD BUT BUT SHE IS REMARKABLY PRODUCTIVE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR BEST CHANCE IS GIVING NATURE A CHANCE SHAUN BAKER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING
TIME IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE HOW LONG CAN A DIRECTOR MAKE A SINGLE SHOT LAST IN THE CASE OF SEBASTIAN SHIPPER WHO'S AWARD WINNING VICTORIA OUT IN THE U.K. IN CINEMAS
THE ANSWER IS TWO HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES ALL THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE FILM ONLY A HANDFUL OF DIRECTORS HAVE EVER ACHIEVE SOMETHING SIMILAR ALTHOUGH MANY HAVE TRIED TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF A SINGLE LINGERING SHOT WILL SEBASTIAN SCHIFFER JOINS US NOW FROM BERLIN AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED FROM EDINBURGH BYE HANNAH MCGILL FREELANCE WRITER AND CRITIC AND FORMER ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE EDINBURGH FILM FESTIVAL GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MONEY GOOD MIND SEBASTIAN SHIPPER WHAT WHAT AN IDEA WHAT AN ACHIEVEMENT WITH WAS IT SOMETHING YOU'D ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
NO NO NO NO IT CAME A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE I ACTUALLY WENT DOWN TO DO IT AND OF COURSE
ON MANY LEVELS IF YOU LOOK AT THAT IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY BRAINLESS IDEA CHE'S WAY FOR FOR SOME YEARS BUT IT ALWAYS CAME BACK WITH SOME LIKE SOME LITTLE DOG FROM THE STREET AND I THINK ONE DAY I FELL IN LOVE BRAINLESS BECAUSE IT IS JUST SO DIFFICULT
IT'S AS REALLY MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW JUST HAVE ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT FILMMAKING ANOMALY YOU SPEND WEEKS OR ACTUALLY ACT MONTHS OF LEG MICROMANAGING EVERY LITTLE THING THERE GOES INTO A FILM AND THEN YOU SAID AND AN AIRED IN ROME FOR ANOTHER AT LEAST A COUPLE A MAN SOMETIMES HALF A YEAR TEW
ALL THESE LITTLE BITS TOGETHER SO DID DO IT IN ONE SHOT IS HE'S NOT WELL ADVISED JUST EXPLAIN SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT THE FILM COS I THINK IT'S WEB TO FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT IT'S NOT AS IF THE ACTION TAKES PLACE IN ONE ROOM WHICH WOULD THAT'S MUCH EASIER SAID DESCRIBE THE PLOT
WELL I ALWAYS SAY IT'S ABOUT A BANK ROBBERY BUT MY GIRLFRIEND SAYS I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY OWN FILM WAS ABOUT SHE SAYS IT'S ABOUT A LOST STORY SO I GUESS WE'RE BOTH A LITTLE RIDE AND NOW IT'S ABOUT A NIGHT IN BERLIN IT'S WEE WEE STARRED IN A NIGHTCLUB AND THEN WE GO TO ALL KINDS OF PLACES YOU CAN GO IN THERE MADAM BERLIN AND IN THIS CASE AND IT INCLUDES A BANG AND THERE'S THAT THERE'S A CAR JOURNEY AND YOU FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS A LOG
YEAH WE DIDN'T WANT TO DESIGN AS IN LIKE ISLAND STILL DOES AND ONE TAIG EM NOW OH LET'S LET'S DESIGN HAD TOWARDS LIKE TO HAVE THAT THAT IT'S EASY WE WANNA TEACH YOU THEY GO FROM PLACE TO PLACE AND THEY'RE OUT IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN A CLUB LIKE A SAD AND IN A CAR AND ON THE ROOF OF A BUILDING AND YEAH YEAH ALL IN ALL IN ONE SHORT AND ONE TAKE AT HANNAH MCGILL WHAT DID YOU THINK OF IT
I THOUGHT IT WAS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING TO WATCH BECAUSE THAT ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED BEFORE ACTUALLY QUITE RARELY AND IT'S INTERESTING TO COME ACROSS SOMETHING THAT NOT THAT MANY FILM DIRECTORS HAVE EVEN WHEN HE TRIED LET ALONE GENUINELY DONE AS AS YOU MENTION THEY'VE BEEN A COUPLE OF FAMOUS EXAMPLES WHERE THE EFFECT IT'S KIND OF FAKED BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S ONLY WITH THE ADVENT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS BECAUSE WHEN USED TO BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU COULD FIT ONTO THAT A REEL OF FILM
AND THE PEOPLE HE FAKED IT ALFRED HITCHCOCK YES HITS YOU COOKED IT REALLY BEAUTIFULLY AND IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT BUT THAT HAS CONCEALED CUTS IN IT AND IT BASICALLY OPERATES LIKE A STAGE PLAY IT WAS BASED ON A STAGE CLEAN IT FEELS LIKE A STATE PLATES IN ONE ROOM AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES RUSSIAN ARK WAS HER FROM THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO DO IT DIGITALLY ALEXANDER TOOK HER OFF IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO BUT THAT AGAIN IS A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE FROM THIS COS THAT DOESN'T TRY AND KEEP YOU IN REAL TIME IT ACTUALLY
TRANSPORT SHE THROUGH THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF HISTORY THROUGH A MUSEUM IT'S A SORT OF HISTORICAL PAGEANT BUT WITH THIS ONE WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT ALTHOUGH THIS TENDS TO BE SEEN AS A KIND OF GIMMICKY THING TO DO YOU'RE A SHOW OFFY FILM STUDENTY THING TO DO IT'S NOT DONE FOR GIMMICKY OR STUNT HE REASONS IT'S DONE BECAUSE THIS IS HOW IT FEELS FOR THE CHARACTERS THEY ARE PROPELLING FORWARD REALLY FAST THROUGH TIME AT LEAST FOR THE SORT OF SECOND PART OF THE MOVIE WHERE THINGS REALLY RAMP UP AND GET REALLY FAST
AND SO FOR THE VIEWER IT FEELS VERY REAL AND SEBASTIAN SHIP AND JUST TALK US THROUGH HOW YOU DOING YOU MUST HAVE I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU REHEARSED A LOT YOU PLOTTED THE JOURNEY THAT THE CHARACTERS WOULD TAKE
YEAH I MEAN WE DO THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE LIKE MOST OF THE DIALOGUE AS IMPROVISED BUT HAVING SAID THAT IMPROVISATION IS A FUNNY THING IT'S NOT PEOPLE THAT NEVER MET EACH OTHER GET TOGETHER AND START DOING SOMETHING IMPROVISATION AS A CONCEPT AND LEG OF WE AND MAYBE THE MOST BEST KNOWN YOU KNOW VEHICLE OF IMPROVISATION AT UP FREE
SOMETHING BUT YOU HAVE TO BE A REALLY GOOD MUSICIAN AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY WELL TRAINED TO PULL IT ALL AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE CHARACTER WITH A CLUB AND STARRY TRIED OUT AND WE WORKED A LOT ON THIS AND AND ONE THING I WANNA
I WANNA SAY BECAUSE OF COURSE IS THE ONE TAKE EM AND ALL THAT FOR ME IT IS IS A VEHICLE TO GET TO SOMETHING ELSE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ONE THING THAT AWESOME YOU KNOW BROUGHT ME A STEP CLOSER TO ACTUALLY DOING IT I WAS READING IN A FRANCIS BACON REALLY LAUGHED CARAVAGGIO
BUT HE DIDN'T PAINT LIKE CARPACCIO HE DID HE'S ON YOU KNOW WHAT HE EVEN CALLED HIMSELF AS ON SCILLY
PAINTINGS AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT IN FILM MAKING FOR SOME REASON WE WE KIND OF ENDED UP ALMOST AT THE POINT WHERE WE YOU KNOW THE THE REDNESS ON THE CUPBOARDS YOU A FILM MAKING IN MY WORLD AS THE SEVENTIES
MAYBE MOST POLITICAL MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS EVER MADE AT HANNAH MCGILL HOW MUCH A SEBASTIAN ADDED TO THE TO THE STORY OF A FILM AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THIS KIND OF THING I THINK WE'RE SORT OF INNOVATION REMINDS US THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT QUITE A YOUNG MEDIUM AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE RULES THAT ARE SET IN STONE FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE DIGITAL WAYS TO TO CHANGE THINGS
EDITING GIVES THE VIEWER A CHANCE TO SORT OF TAKE A BREATH AND IT COMFORTS THE VIEWER IN A WAY IT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE STORY VERY SLIGHTLY ALLOWS TIME TO BE MANIPULATED BY THE STORY TELLER THIS IS A WAY OF JUST PITCHING EVERYTHING FORWARD REALLY QUICKLY AND GIVING THEIR AUDIENCE NO SPACE TO GET OUT OF THE STORY AND I THINK THAT'S THRILLING AND I THINK WE WILL SEE IMITATED VERY MUCH AN INCOMING HANNAH MCGILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SEBASTIAN CHIPPER THANK YOU TO HER VICTORIA IS OUT IN U.K. CINEMAS
