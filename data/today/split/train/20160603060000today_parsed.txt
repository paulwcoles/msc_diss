HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD
M.P.S BELIEVE FOREIGN NATIONALS SHOULD BE REMOVED QUICKLY AT THE END OF THEIR SENTENCE OR EVEN DURING THEIR SENTENCE IF THEY CONSERVE THE REMAINING TIME IN PRISON IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW CLOSE TO SIX THOUSAND CONVICTED CRIMINALS ARE STILL LIVING IN BRITAIN EVEN AFTER THEIR RELEASE FROM PRISON
TODAY THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE EXPRESSED ITS PARTICULAR FRUSTRATION AT THE NUMBER OF E.U. PRISONERS IN THE U.K. THE THREE NATIONALITIES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF POLAND IRELAND AND ROMANIA WITH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED BETWEEN THEM
THE M.P. SAID ONE ADVANTAGE OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD BE THE EASY REMOVAL OF CRIMINALS TO OTHER MEMBER COUNTRIES AND THE CLEAR INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM WOULD LEAVE THE PUBLIC TO QUESTION THE POINT OF THE U.K. REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE E.U.
THE HOME OFFICE SAID THREE TIMES MORE EUROPEAN CRIMINALS WERE BEING REMOVED COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE WARNED THAT COUNCIL TAX BILLS COULD RISE WHORE SERVICES COULD BE CUT IF THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T OFFER MORE MONEY TO CARE FOR CHILD REFUGEES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAYS THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST FOR EACH CHILD IS FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS BUT COUNCILS ARE BEING OFFERED FORTY ONE THOUSAND POUNDS A SCHEME IS DUE TO BEGIN NEXT MONTH TO DISPERSE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ACROSS BRITAIN

LEVELS AND TO DO WELL
THE TIME NOW IT'S SIX MINUTES PAST SIX WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST JERRY WINNERS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE THIS MORNING ADJAY DO WE WANT TO HEAR IT WELL I THINK SOME OF US STAY YES INDEED PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE U.K. BECAUSE IT'LL BE ANOTHER FINE DAY HERE WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FURTHER EAST WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CLOUD OR THE WEAK WEATHER FRONT DRIFTING IN FROM THE NORTH SEA SO ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND SWELL IT'LL BE FAIRLY CLOUDY SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPING HERE SOME OF THOSE TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE HEAVY WITH SOME HAIL AND THUNDER

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JANE IT IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE PAPERS ALL OF WHOM HAD DIGESTING THAT T. V. QUITE A DEBATE BUT THE T.V. APPEARANCE BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN FRONT OF VOTERS ON SKY NEWS LAST NIGHT THE GUARDIAN IS THE ONLY PAPER THE PRODUCE OF THE HEADLINE I THINK MY CAMERA WOULD HAVE WANTED CAMERON LETTERS NOT ROLL THE DICE ON EUROPE VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. WOULD BE AN ACT OF ECONOMIC SELF HARM THE PAPER QUOTED HIM SAYING
THE TELEGRAPH TAKES A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW WANTS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE VOTERS THOUGHT MISTER CAMERON CAMERON SAVAGED IT SAYS AS VOTERS REVOLT ANGRY VOTERS THE PAPERS ARE TURNED ON MY CAMERA DURING THE FIRST TELEVISED DEBATE OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE MAIL IN ITS INSIDE PAGES SAYS DAVE LEARNS WHAT VOTERS REALLY THINK ON MIGRATION AND IT
SKETCHED BY QUENTIN LETTS HAS HAD A CALL STRETCHER BEARERS FOR THE BURBLING P.M. AND THE SUN NO MORE FRIENDLY STOP YOU'RE YOU ARE WAFFLING
THE TELEGRAPH A PICTS PUTS ON ON ITS FRONT PAGE AT LEAST ONE OF THE SMALLER STORIES ON ITS FRONT PAGE HE PICKS UP AND COVERS ON INSIDE PAGE THREE COMMENTS MADE BY THE DUCHESS OF RUTLAND AT THE HAY FESTIVAL YESTERDAY SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE IS DELIGHTED THAT HER DAUGHTER WILL NOT INHERIT THE DUKEDOM BECAUSE IT INVOLVES SO MUCH HARD WORK
AND THIS IS THE DUCHESS OF RUTLAND IS SHE THINKS OF HERSELF AS A SEA OF THE ESTATE A BEAVER CASTLE SO SHE'S PRETTY MUCH RUNNING IT SHE SAID EVERYTHING GOES SO THE ARISTOCRACY IS A BIT LIKE BEING A FARMER'S DAUGHTER FROM THE WELSH HILLS EVERYTHING GOES TO THE BOYS QUITE RIGHTLY BUT IN OUR CASE TO THE OLDER SON WHO IS THEIR FOURTH CHILD
THE TIME SPLASHES ON INVESTIGATION EXTORTIONATE PRICES HAD TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION POUNDS THE N.H.S. DRUG BILL SAYS AND HE'S THE MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN HAVE BEEN INCREASING THE PRICES OF DRUGS PAID FOR BY THE N.H.S. BY UP TO TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT STARTLING FIGURE ON HERE ABOUT THE DRUG HYDROCORTISONE OFTEN PRESCRIBED OF COURSE WAS SEVENTY P. A PACKET IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
IT IS NOW SAID TO BE EIGHTY FIVE POUNDS A PACKET THIS YEAR
ALL THE PAPERS PICK UP ON B.H.S. CLOTHED IN THE WORDS OF THE EYE ON ITS FRONT PAGE BRITAIN HIGH STREETS LOSE ANOTHER BRAND AND AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS THAT ARE NOW UNDER THREAT BECAUSE OF THAT AFTER IN THE WORDS OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND ITS LEAD LAST DITCH EFFORTS FAILED TO SAVE B.H.S. FRUITLESS SCRAMBLE TO FIND THE BATH IT'S NOW TEN PAST SIX
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT WE ARE ALL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AS POWERFUL AS THE PRIME MINISTER AT LEAST THAT IS IN DETERMINING THE DESTINY OF THEIR COUNTRY WHETHER WE STAY IN OR GET OUT OF THE E.U.
THAT IS WHY DAVID CAMERON'S FIRST T.V. APPEARANCE IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE OF VOTERS REALLY MATTERED THE PRIME MINISTER SPEAKING LAST NIGHT ON SKY NEWS ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS HE FACED WAS WHETHER WE COULD DELIVER HIS PROMISE TO REDUCED NET MIGRATION TO THE U.K. TO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR IF THE COUNTRY CHOSE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE PRIME MINISTER REFUSED TO ABANDON WHAT HE CALLED AN AMBITION REMEMBER HE USED TO CALL IT A TARGET AND HE CLAIMED THAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT COULD AFTER ALL BE CONTROLLED WITHIN ME
THERE ARE GOOD WAYS OF CONTROLLING MIGRATION AND THERE ARE BAD PLACE A GOOD WAY IS DOING WHAT I DID IN MY RENEGOTIATION WHICH OF COURSE HASN'T COME INTO EFFECT YET AND WILL IF WE VOTE TO STAY WHICH IS TO SAY TO PEOPLE IF YOU COME TO OUR COUNTRY FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T CLAIM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SECOND OF ALL AFTER SIX MONTHS IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A JOB YOU HAVE TO LEAVE AND THIRD OF ALL IF YOU DO COME AND GET A JOB YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR FOUR YEARS PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM
MY CAMERON'S CASE FOR STAYING WAS THAT LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET OF FRASER USED AGAIN AND AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE PHRASE
IT WAS AN ACT OF ECONOMIC SELF HARM FOR BRITAIN BUT HE FACED ACCUSATIONS THAT HE WAS SCAREMONGERING AND WAFFLING INCLUDING THIS FROM THE STUDENTS AWRY BOW WOW IS
IT'S MY FACE AGAIN I KNOW I SHALL HANG ONTO LIKE ME NOW COS I'VE SEEN YOU INTERRUPT MANY PEOPLE O.K. LET ME THINK NOW DO YOU WANT TO RING THE PLASTIC DO TURKEY IF YOU WANT ME I'M AN ENGLISH LITERATURE STUDENT I NO WAFFLING WHEN I SEE HER
WHEN YOU DO GET A CHANCE TO WAFFLE OR AT LEAST SPEAK DIRECT TO THE AUDIENCE THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
AS WE GO HOME WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WE LOOK OUR CHILDREN AND I'VE GRANDCHILDREN THE WE THINK WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PAY PACKET LET US NOT ROLL A DICE
ON THEIR FUTURE BRITAIN DOESN'T SUCCEED WHEN WE QUIT WE SUCCEED WHEN WE GET STUCK IN WE WORK TO IMPROVE HIS ORGANISATIONS WE SAFEGUARD THE PROSPERITY AND THE SECURITY OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY TO ME THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
THIS WAS NOT A DEBATE OF COURSE IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE THE WORD JUST ONE MAN FACING QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE BUT TONIGHT JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE WILL TAKE PART IN A SIMILAR EVENT ON SKY AND WHO'S TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR LEAVING THE E.U. ALL DEBATES WILL OF COURSE FOLLOW ON OTHER CHANNELS
IT'S THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX THERE ARE THIRTEEN THOUSAND CONVICTED CRIMINALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE U.K. WHO SHOULD NOT BE HERE ACCORDING TO M.P.S ON THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE AND THEY WARN THAT IT'S UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM DANIEL SANDFORD IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT AND I KNOW THEY DESCRIBE IT AS THE NUMBERS AS THE SIZE OF A SMALL TOWN
YES THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S THE NUMBER OF WHAT THEY CALLED FOREIGN NATIONAL OFFENDERS WHO ARE BOTH IN PRISON AND ALSO WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON BUT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY SO THERE'S MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OF THESE FOREIGN NATIONAL OFFENDERS WHO'VE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON BUT IF NOT BEEN REMOVED TO THEIR HOME COUNTRIES BUT THE M.P.S ON THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE I HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO HIGHLIGHT A PARTICULAR ASPECT
OF THIS AND THAT IS FOR NATIONAL OFFENDERS FROM E.U. COUNTRIES AND THEY SAY THAT THE FAILURE TO USE THE PRISONER TRANSFER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES TO NOT ONLY REMOVE
PRISONERS WHO FINISH THEIR SENTENCES BUT ALSO TO SEND PRISONERS WHO ARE SERVING THEIR SENTENCES TO SERVE THE SENSES IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THAT PROPERLY
IT'S ACTUALLY STARTING TO UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE POINT OF THE U.K. REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE E.U. IN THE M.P.S HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM ARE IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE E.U. THEY'VE GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE THAT POINT IN THIS REPORT TODAY FOR THAT TOTAL OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO ARE BOTH IN PRISON AND IN THE COMMUNITY IS FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD
THAT IS THAT THAT'S THE NUMBER FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT OF COURSE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF FROM E.U. COUNTRIES NOW FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP THREE COUNTRIES IT TWITCH THERE A FOREIGN NATIONAL OFFENDERS IN PRISON IN BRITAIN OF POLAND TO HAVE MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED ISLAND AND ROMANIA WE HAVE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED SO THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS THE NUMBERS WITH YOU PRISONERS IN BRITISH JAILS WHAT DOES THE HOME OFFICE SAYING CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT
THEY'RE POINTING OUT THAT THERE IS NOW AN E. YOU PRISONER TRANSFER AGREEMENT WHICH WAS AGREED IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN BUT OF COURSE IT'S TAKEN A WHILE FOR THE TWENTY SIX COUNTRIES WHO HAVE SO FAR IMPLEMENTED IT TO GET UP TO SPEED ON IT UNDER THAT AGREEMENT PEOPLE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS OFFENCES FROM E.U. COUNTRIES CAN BE SENT BACK
TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO SERVE THEIR SENTENCE IN THOSE HOME COUNTRIES AT THE HOME COUNTRIES EXPENSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S TAKEN A WHILE FOR THAT TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE ON POLAND THE HOME OFFICE ONLY EXPECT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS TO BE REMOVED THIS YEAR OF SERVING PRISONERS TO POLAND SO THE HOME OFFICE OF COURSE HE'S CAUGHT SLIGHTLY IN FACT THAT BECAUSE IT'S
IN THE BUILD UP TO THE REFERENDUM THEY CAN'T GET INVOLVED IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS BUT THEY POINT OUT THAT THIS STUFF IS STARTING TO COME IN BUT WHAT THE M.P.S ARE SAYING IS YEAH BUT THESE INEFFICIENCIES ARE EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT
ABOUT THE E. USE SO IT'S A COME ON THE ONE HAND YES IT'S EASIER TO SET THESE AGREEMENTS UP WITHIN THE E.U. SYSTEM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND THE INEFFICIENCIES IN IT EXACTLY THE SORT OF THINGS THAT FRUSTRATE PEOPLE WITH THESE YOU O.K.
DANIEL SANDFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE CHAIR OF THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE IN ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIXTY EMPLOYEES OF B.H.S. THE CUSTOMERS HAVE THAT ICONIC BRAND ARE DIGESTING THE NEWS THAT IT WILL SOON DISAPPEAR FROM THE HIGH STREET AFTER EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS THERE MANY ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHY IT COLLAPSED HIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS
COMES FROM ROBBIE I'M NOT IN THE MORNING YES THE BIGGEST RETAIL FAILURE IN ALMOST A DECADE WILL LEAD TO CLOSING DOWN SALES AND ALL OF B.H.S. HAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE STORES THE JOBS OF ELEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS ARE ALSO AT RISK B.H.S. HASN'T MADE MONEY FOR YEARS SO A FAILURE TO FIND A BUYER WITH DEEP ENOUGH POCKETS IT'S PERHAPS NO SURPRISE BUT THIS IS NO ORDINARY RETAIL COLLAPSE B.H.S. DID USED TO MAKE MONEY ITS FORMER OWNERS THE FAMILY OF SIR PHILIP GREEN TOOK OUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN DIVIDENDS FROM ITS ARCADIA BUSINESS
ITS MOST RECENT OWNERS LED BY DOMINIC S'APPELLE TOOK MANAGEMENT FEES FROM B.H.S. WHILE IT SLID TOWARDS ADMINISTRATION WE CAN TO MAUREEN LESLEY THE PRESIDENT OF THE INSOLVENCY PRACTITIONERS ASSOCIATION MORN MORNING MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE FOR THAT FOR THIS PROCESS OF WINDING UP THE RETAIL
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY VERY LARGE CONCERN AND CAN I SAY FIRST OF ALL IT'S ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR THE EMPLOYEES THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OFF THEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE QUITE IMPORTANT TO THIS PROCESS OF WINDING DOWN THERE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A PERIOD OF CONSULTATION WHERE SOME ALBEIT THERE MAYBE AND EVERY N. AN INEVITABILITY INSOFAR AS THAT THEY
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS BUT THERE MUST BE A PERIOD OF CONSULTATION WITH SOME AND
AS WELL AS THE WINDING DOWN OF THEIR BUSINESS RIGHT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF IT IS THE EIGHT THOUSAND DIRECTLY EMPLOYED PEOPLE PERHAPS THE FURTHER THREE THOUSAND INDIRECTLY EMPLOYED WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT THE ADMINISTRATORS ARE SEEING THAT THE COMPANY IS NOW ENTERING A PERIOD OF WANED DOWN WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS A SEAL OFF THE REMAINING STOCK AND ORCHARDLEIGH CLOSURE OF THE STORE'S RIGHT WE'LL TAXPAYERS DO YOU THINK WOULD BE LEFT WITH THEIR REDUNDANCY
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FIGURES HERE BUT IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT SOME OF IT WILL HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE TAXPAYER RIGHT AND WAS IT UNREASONABLE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS TO INSISTED A BUYER HAD TO TAKE THE WHOLE BUSINESS RATHER THAN PERHAPS ALLOWING A NEW BUYER TO SAVE PART OF IT
AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT THAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHY THE ADMINISTRATORS FORM THE STRATEGY THE DEAD THEY WILL HAVE HAD SOWN TREASONS FOR FOR ASKING FOR THAT
AND I'M SORRY BUT WITHOUT FRONT THE DETAILS IT'S REALLY NOT FOR YOU TO HAVE ME TO CALL MEANT OH KAY THANK YOU LESLEY THERE FROM INSOLVENCY PRACTITIONERS ASSOCIATION WERE NOT OF THE OFFERS TO BUY B.H.S. WAS JUDGED ACCEPTABLE BY THE ADMINISTRATORS THEY BLAMED SEISMIC SHIFTS IN THE RETAIL SECTOR FOR THE COLLAPSE AS WELL AS MANY JOB LOSSES THE COMPANY'S PENSIONERS ARE ALSO FACING REDUCED PENSIONS IN RETIREMENT AS A BLACK HOLE IN THE FUND OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS THE PENSION SCHEME IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TAKEN OVER BY THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND
IN THE MELON WORKED FOR B.H.S. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND A STARTED AN ONLINE CAMPAIGN CALLING ON SIR PHILIP GREEN THE FORMER OWNER TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL IN THE PENSION FUND MORNING LYNN GOOD MORNING WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE H. S.
WELL LIKE YOUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND I WAS VERY SADDENED TO HEAR ABOUT IT YESTERDAY AND I FEEL GREATLY FOR ALL THE STAFF WHO ARE AFFECTED AND US AS YOUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID IT'S NOT JUST THE STAFF WHO ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE IN OTHER BUSINESSES SUCH AS DO SUPPLIERS DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND SO ON
WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE HAVE YOU HAD TO YOUR ONLINE CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE BLACK HOLE OF THE PENSION FUND WELL PEOPLE ARE
REALLY ANGRY ABOUT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT PHILIP GREEN THERE'S A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO B.H.S. AND PEOPLE ARE COMING RIGHT OUT AND SAYING SO AND SO HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD PUT INTO THE PENSION SCHEME
WELL HE IS REPUTED TO HAVE TAKEN OUT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OR HE AND HIS FAMILY I SHOULD SAY ARE REPUTED TO HAVE TAKEN OUT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT THEY OWN B.H.S. THEY PENSION FUND DEFICIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS I BELIEVE HE HAS THREE YACHTS BUT YOU CAN ONLY BE ON ONE YACHT AT ONCE I THINK SO PERHAPS YOU SHOULD SELL A COUPLE OF THE YACHTS AND REPLENISH THEIR PENSION FUND
WAS A BIT OF GREEN SAYS HE SAD AND DISAPPOINTED BY THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. AND HAD HOPED TO SEE THE COMPANY SOLD AS A GOING CONCERN HE AND B.H.S. HAS MOST RECENT OWNER FORMER RACING DRIVER THREE TIMES BANKRUPT DOMINIC WILL FACE QUESTIONS FROM M.P.S AND COMING WEEKS THE INSOLVENCY SERVICE IS INVESTIGATING THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO LAUNCH AN INQUIRY WITH US IS ALSO THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS SIMON WALKER MORNING SIMON GOOD MORNING YOU'RE NORMALLY A DEFENDER OF BUSINESS CAN YOU DEFEND THE WAY THAT B.H.S. HAS BEEN RUN
NO I CAN'T I THINK IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE DEEPLY DAMAGING TO THE REPUTATION OF BRITISH BUSINESS AS A WHOLE WE SPENT A LOT TIME AGONISING ABOUT THE LOSS OF TRUST IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I THINK WE CAN SEE THIS IS WHY PHILIP GREEN IS A VERY HIGH PROFILE BUSINESS LEADER HE'S THE PERSON IS ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH KATE MOSS ON HIS ARM AND WHO HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLION PLANT SUPER YACHT AND SO ON WHEN SOMEONE LIKE THIS
ENDS UP BEHAVING LIKE THIS PEOPLE PEOPLE THINK THAT'S HOW BUSINESS IS AND IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MORTGAGED THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO GET THEIR COMPANY GOING THEM TO OWN THIS KIND OF LAVISH THINGS SO I THINK THERE HAS BEEN A LEMON T'BALL FAILURE OF BEHAVIOUR AND THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED IT DO YOU AGREE WITH LYNNE MACMILLAN THAT
SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PERHAPS TOP UP HER PENSION FOR I THINK HE CERTAINLY HAS MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES I THINK WE NEED A PROPER INVESTIGATION
IT CAN'T BE LIKE THE H.BOS'S INVESTIGATION WHICH CANNOT AGONISES FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEN HE COMES UP WITH A CONCLUSION WHEN EVERYONE'S FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT WE'VE GOT TWO PARLIAMENTARY ENQUIRIES AT THE MOMENT THAT A TALKING TO SIR PHILIP IN DUE COURSE THEY WILL TALK TO THE LAWYERS CAN'T BOOTS TO LORD GRAB ANOTHER WHO WAS CHAIRMAN OF ARCADIA THROUGHOUT THIS TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED OF THESE PEOPLE ABOUT HOW WE'VE ENDED UP WITH A SITUATION YOU CAN'T JUST GET YOURSELF OFF THE HOOK
BY SELLING A BUSINESS IS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN BANKRUPT RIGHT WILL YOU TIME IS A FORMER RACING DRIVER WOULDN'T KNOW RETAIL EXPERIENCE SHOULD THE RULES BE TIGHTENED UP AND TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF CORPORATE FAILURE HAPPENING IN FUTURE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE COMING OUT OF THE INQUIRY THEY ARE GOING TO BE FAILURES AND LOOK B.H.S. WAS PROBABLY GOING TO FAIL ANYWAY BUT IT'S THE MANNER OF ITS FAILURE AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS UP DUMPING HUGE LIABILITIES ONTO THE TRACKS
THAT IS A PROBLEM AND IT IS THE LACK OF DUE DILIGENCE IN SELLING IT TO SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN BANKRUPT THREE TIMES WHO A FORMER RACING DRIVER WHO HAS OBVIOUS EXPERIENCE AT THE SARAH SOMETHING'S WRONG SEEN OSCAR IS A MARKET GUESS THIS MORNING U.K. FUND ECK MANAGER AT STRAIGHT DO YOU HAVE FEARS FOR THE REST OF THE HIGH STREET IS A CLOSURE OF A B.H.S. STORE ON A HIGH STREET SOMETHING THAT COULD AFFECT RETAILERS ALONGSIDE IT
IT WILL AFFECT RETAILERS AND ALSO A LOT OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE PARTICULARLY IN THE REGENT SO I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE IN THERE THE WIND DOWN OF THE BUSINESS IS THAT SOME OF THE MORE ATTRACTIVE STORES MAY FIND THEMSELVES BEING ACQUIRED AND SUBSUMED INTO OTHER FASCIA IS THE QUESTION THEN REMAINS OVER THERE THE REST OF THE ESTATE THERE'S ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR STORES
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPLIT WILL BE BUT THERE WILL BE A NUMBER THAT WON'T FIND BUYERS SEE ENOUGH OSCAR THEN MACMILLAN SIMON WALKER THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING NOW THIS IS THE TIME OF THE WEEK WHEN WE CHAT TO COMPANY BOSS AND I'VE BEEN OUT IN A LESS THAN FETCHING BRIGHT ORANGE JACKET AND A HARD HAT TO MEET THIS WEEK'S COMPANY CHIEF EXECUTIVE

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS SAID THEY NEED MORE MONEY FROM WHITEHALL TO COVER THE COST OF CARING FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILD REFUGEES IT SAYS COUNCIL TAX BILLS COULD RISE AND SERVICES COULD BE CUT BECAUSE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST FOR EACH CHILD IS FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WHILE COUNCILS ARE RECEIVING FORTY ONE THOUSAND
A SEVEN YEAR OLD JAPANESE BOY WHO WAS MISSING SINCE SATURDAY AFTER HIS PARENTS ABANDONED HIM IN A TEMPORARY PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE IT HAD BEEN FEARED THAT YOUR MOTOR TO LUCA WAS DEAD BECAUSE HE WAS LEFT IN A FOREST IN NORTHERN JAPAN WAY OF BEING AS LIVE HE WAS DISCOVERED AT AN ARMY TRAINING BASE WHERE HE HAD TAKEN SHELTER IN ONE HUT SINCE THE WEEKEND WITH ACCESS ONLY TO WATER

THANK YOU CHARLES TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN DAVID CAMERAS FACED A T. V. STUDIO OF SCEPTICAL VOTERS TO MAKE ONE THING ABSOLUTELY PLAIN
THEY DON'T LIKE SCAREMONGERING NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR WAS WATCHING AND IT'S EYE SINCE NORMAN THAT IT WAS ALMOST AS MUCH NEWS IN WHAT THEY ASKED HIM AS WHAT HE SAID A REPLY
I THINK IT UNDERLINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMMIGRATION IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE ISSUE IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BECAUSE AGAIN AND AGAIN MY CAMERA WAS CHALLENGED OVER IT WITH MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE TALKING ABOUT A NEVER ENDING STREAM OF MIGRANTS COMING IN ANOTHER WOMAN SAID I THINK WE'RE STRUGGLING I THINK WE ARE SICK AND SINKING COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRESSURE ON PUBLIC SERVICES
AND IT SEEMED TO MISTER CAMERON WAS REPEATEDLY PUSHED ONTO THE BACK FOOT OVER IMMIGRATION IN PART BECAUSE OF HIS COMMITMENT TO GET NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSAND BUT PART BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS BASIC QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT FREE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE E.U. AND THE ANSWER IS YOU CAN'T IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN IN THE SINGLE MARKET BUT MY CAMERON'S RESPONSE LAST NIGHT WAS THEY WILL LOOK THE SINGLE MARKET IS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ALMOST AS IF TO SAY IT'S A PRICE WORTH PAYING AND IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD
HE DIDN'T HAVE A TIMETABLE FOR WHEN HE MIGHT GET NET MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSAND AND YOU SEEM TO SUGGEST WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL EUROPEAN ECONOMIES RECOVERED AND THE LESS THERE WAS LESS OF A PULL BRINGING MIGRANTS TO THE U.K. HE OF COURSE WANTED TO GET BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HIS STRONG SUIT WHICH HE THINKS IS THE ECONOMY FASCINATING THOUGH THAT CHOICE OF LANGUAGE WASN'T IT NOT TALK ABOUT EUROPE
NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU NOT USING THE LABEL EUROPEAN UNION AGAIN AND AGAIN USING THAT PHRASE SINGLE MARKET WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY THINKS HE'S MORE APPEALING AND I MEAN IT WAS STRIKING HOW OFTEN HE KEPT EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF THE SINGLE MARKET TRYING TO SHIFT THE ARGUMENT BACK ONTO THE ECONOMY BUT I MEAN THE OTHER THING THAT STRUCK ME NICK WAS THAT
I MEAN IT WAS A PRETTY HOSTILE AUDIENCE AND EVERY TIME HE TRIED TO ARTICULATE AN ARGUMENT IT WAS ALMOST DISMISSED AS SCAREMONGERING ONE PERSON TALKED ABOUT CLASSIC CAMERON SCARE TACTICS
AND WHEN HE SET OUT ALL THE ORGANISATIONS THAT BACKED HIM ON THE ECONOMY WHETHER IT BE THE I.M.F. THE GOVERNOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE O.E.C.D. ALL THOSE ARGUMENTS WERE ALMOST PARK TO ONE SIDE AS WELL THAT'S JUST SCAREMONGERING AND MORE THAN THAT
I JUST FELT THAT NORMALLY IN THESE SORT OF OCCASIONS I'VE SEEN MY MANY OF THEM HE HAS A SORT OF SELF DEPRECATING
COURTEOUS REASONABLE STYLE WHICH TENDS TO WIN OVER AN AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT THEY WERE HAVING NONE OF IT IT WHAT'S FIRST ASIAN CAUSES THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE CHOSEN TO A LARGE EXTENT BY THE BROADCASTERS IN THIS CASE SKY NEWS AND OF COURSE THE AUDIENCES ALSO SELECTED BY THE BROKERS SO SEEING HOW MICHAEL GAVE IS TREATED
BY AN AUDIENCE CHOSEN IN A SIMILAR WAY AND WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING SO THAT IS WHAT DOWNING STREET DRAWING SOME RELIEF FROM AND ALL THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SAYING WELL YOU KNOW IT WAS A LIVE TELEVISION AUDIENCE OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AGGRESSIVE THEY'RE PUMPED UP THEY HOPE MICHAEL DOVE WILL GET A SIMILAR RUN ROUND ON THE ECONOMY I WONDER ACTUALLY BECAUSE
I FELT THERE WAS ALMOST IT'S TO STOP SAYIN ANTI CAMERON FACTOR BUT IT DID STRIKE ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAST LIKE THE LATTER YEARS OF TONY BLAIR WHERE YOU KNOW THEY JUST WEREN'T PREPARED TO LISTEN AND THEY WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE A GO AT HIM AND I JUST WONDER WHETHER THROUGH THE SHEENA'S COMING OFF MY CAMERA INTRIGUING AGAIN BY SAYING THAT JEREMY CORBIN
WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT HE HAD TO SAY TO TRY AND GET THEM ON HIS SIDE NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN BRITAIN'S HIGH STREETS WILL BE LOSING ANOTHER BRAND TODAY AND WITH IT UP TO ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS BECAUSE NO BUYER COULD BE FOUND FOR B.H.S. EMMA SIMPSON IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT AND EMMA WHAT HAPPENS NOW IF YOU GO TO A B.H.S. TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING
OH YES WE'RE GOING TO SEE CLOSING DOWN OUR FINAL SALE SIGNS GOING UP AS EARLY AS TODAY AND THE STORIES WILL CONTINUE TO TRADE UNTIL THE STOCK RUNS OUT OR UNTIL THE POINT THAT EACH STORE IS SOLD AND THAT COULD BE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THIS ENTIRE
BUSINESS IS WIND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT EIGHT THOUSAND MEMBERS OF STAFF ARE LIKELY TO BE LET GO AND THERE ARE A FURTHER THREE THOUSAND WORKERS WHO ARE CONTRACT HAD TO B.H.S. SO THEY'RE EITHER WORKING IN THE KIT DRING BUSINESS OR IN THE ARCADIA CONCESSIONS WITHIN B.H.S. THEIR JOBS ARE ALSO AT RISK MEANWHILE THE ADMINISTRATORS AND OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON SELLING
THE ASSETS AND I THINK WE CAN EXPECT A FAIR AMOUNT OF INTEREST FROM A NUMBER OF RETAILERS TO PICK UP PARCELS OF STORES I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WILL ANYONE BUY THE BRAND COULD SOMEONE BY A CHUNK OF STORIES AND TRY TO MONITORS B.H.S. A GUESS THAT REMAINS A POSSIBILITY BUT I THINK IT SEEMS VERY SLIM COS I HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CERTAINLY INTERESTED WHAT WHY COULD THEY NOT FIND SOMEBODY THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THERE WERE A LOT OF NAMES
IN THE FRAY THERE WERE MULTIPLE OFFERS WE WERE TOLD BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WAS NO BUYER WILLING OR ABLE TO COME UP WITH A MONEY NECESSARY TO REBELLED THE BUSINESS I WAS TOLD THAT B.H.S. NEEDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF WORKING CAPITAL ON DAY ONE JUST TO STAND A CHANCE AND I THINK IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE FOR MANY SUCCESSFUL RETAILERS ARE FINDING THE GOING TOUGH
ULTIMATELY THE BUSINESS WAS TOO WEAK TO SURVIVE AND NO CREDIBLE BUYER IT SEEMS HAVE THE STOMACH FOR IT WHAT HAPPENS TO SIR PHILIP GREEN WHO OF COURSE SOLD THE BUSINESS A YEAR AGO
I THINK THIS REALLY UPS THE PRESSURE ON HIM NO I MEAN THE QUESTIONS JUST KEEP ON COMING ABOUT HOW AND WHY THEIR BUSINESS COLLAPSE WE HAVE A HOST OF ENQUIRIES UNDER WAY INCLUDING TWO PARLIAMENTARY ENQUIRIES
PHILIP GREEN IS DUE TO APPEAR BEFORE M.P.S LATER THIS MONTH AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM NOW NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TAXPAYER IS GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR A STATUTORY REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS RUNNING INTO MILLIONS OF POUNDS EMMA SIMPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN
A SOLDIER VANISHES FROM HER POST AT A BARRACKS SOON AFTERWARDS HER BODY'S FOUND WITH A BULLET WOUND TO THE HEAD TODAY THE CORONER WILL GIVE HER VERDICT IN THE CASE OF CHERYL JAMES FOUND DEAD DEEPCUT BARRACKS IN SURREY JUNE KELLY JONES ON THE LINE SHE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT OF COURSE SHE'S REMIND US OF SOME MORE OF THE DETAIL OF THE CASE JEAN IF YOU WOULD
WELL NICK OUR CHERYL JAMES WAS ONE OF FOUR YOUNG SOLDIERS TO DIET DEEPCUT BARRACKS OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD THEY'D ALL SUFFERED GUNSHOT WOUNDS NOW IN CHERYL'S CASE INVESTIGATIONS BY BOTH THE ARMY AND THE POLICE CONCLUDED THAT THE WOUND WAS SELF INFLICTED HER FAMILY HAVE ALWAYS QUESTION THIS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUGHT FOR YEARS FOR THIS NEW INQUEST AND THE BIG QUESTIONS FOR THIS INQUEST HAVE BEEN
DID CHERYL JAMES PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE GUN WHICH KILLED HER OR COULD SOMEONE ELSE HAVE FIRED THE SHOT ARE THEY HOPEFUL THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE LIKELY TO GET THE VERDICT
OH I WOULDN'T SAY HOPEFUL COS I THINK THIS IS A FAMILY WHO FEEL THEY'VE HAD A VERY LONG HARD SLOG TO GET TO THIS POINT AND WHAT THEY DO FEEL THOUGH IS THAT HER DEATH HAS BEEN EXAMINED IN A PUBLIC FORUM
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER TWENTY YEARS NOW ON THE FORENSICS EVIDENCE BECAUSE HER DEATH WAS IMMEDIATELY DEEMED TO BE A SUICIDE A BASIC FORENSIC WORK WASN'T DONE SO THE EXPERTS WHO LOOKED AT THIS SHOOTING IN THIS NEW INQUEST HAD TO WORK FROM PHOTOGRAPHS MOST OF THE EXPERTS SAID THEY BELIEVE PRIVATE JAMES HAD DIED FROM WHAT'S CALLED A CLOSE CONTACT SHOT BUT PROFESSOR DEREK POUND HE'S THE PATHOLOGIST WHO WAS APPOINTED BY THE FAMILY HE DISPUTED THIS SAYING HE BELIEVED THE BULLET WAS FIRED BY SOMEONE ELSE
THIS WHAT HAS BECOME A SAGA OVER DEEPCUT HAS BEEN LASTING AN AWFULLY LONG TIME AFTER THIS INQUEST HAS IT FURTHER TO GO DO YOU WELL THE FAMILIES OF THE OTHER THREE SOLDIERS WHO DIED AT DEEPCUT THEY ARE ALSO HOPING FOR NEW INQUEST SO IF THEY GET FRESH HEARINGS THEY WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS THAT SHELL JAMES'S FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH JUNE KELLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS IN THE TIMES IS ANGERED BY WHAT IT CALLS THE EXTORTIONATE PRICES BEING DEMANDED BY SOME COMPANIES FOR DRUGS SUPPLIED TO THE N.H.S. IT'S LEAD STORY REPORTS THE ONE ANTI DEPRESSANT HAS GONE UP FROM UNDER SIX POUNDS TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE PAPER SAYS THE RISERS ARE DUE IN PART TO A LOOPHOLE WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO CAP ON THE AMOUNT FIRMS CAN CHARGE FIRST SOME GENERIC DRUGS THE TIME SAYS FOUR COMPANIES HAVE MADE LARGE PROFITS AS A RESULT THEY LEGALLY THEY'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG

T. SAYS THE INDIAN FIRM HAS BEEN OFFERED A MULTI MILLION POUND LOAN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF THE FACILITY WHICH EMPLOYS AROUND FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THE PAPER REPORTS AT ALTARS BOARD IN MUMBAI HAS YET TO APPROVE THE DEAL BUT HE QUOTES A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATION SAYING WHATEVER HAPPENS
DATA WILL BE THERE TO STAY THE SUN'S FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IS AUNTIE IS ANTI WHITE IT REVEALS THAT THE B. B. C. HAS ADVERTISED TO JUNIOR SCRIPT WRITING WRITING ROLES FOR TELEVISION SET SHOWS SUCH AS HOLBY CITY ONLY FOR CANDIDATES FROM ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUNDS THE B. B. C. TELLS HER SON THESE ARE NOT JOBS BUT TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES PERMITTED UNDER THE EQUALITY ACT
AS WE HAVE AN UNDER REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE FROM ETHNIC MINORITY BACKGROUNDS AND SCRIPT EDITING ROLLS IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND THE MIRROR AMONGST SEVERAL PAPERS WHICH HIGHLIGHT HOW DAVID CAMERON WAS HECKLED BY A TELEVISION AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT DURING THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION ABOUT THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE TELEGRAPH LEADER SAYS THE INCIDENT PROVIDED A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUES THAT ARE TROUBLING PEOPLE HE CONCLUDES BY CALLING ON THE PRIME MINISTER TO IT IT'S WORDS
DO THE DECENT THING AND APPEAR IN A LIVE DEBATE WITH BORIS JOHNSON AND FINALLY THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS THAT THERE'S A GENDER PAY GAP IN POCKET MONEY IT SAYS BOYS IN THE U.K. RECEIVE AN AVERAGE OF SIX POUNDS AND NINETY THREE PENCE A WEEK ALMOST TWELVE PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE SIX POUNDS SIXTEEN GIVEN TO GIRLS ONES RIGHT CAMPING RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER IS QUOTED IN THE MAIL SAYING
THIS RESEARCH SHOWS WE ARE VALUING GIRLS LESS A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY ENTER THE WORKPLACE BEST I KEEP A DIGNIFIED SILENCE AT THIS BUT IT IS SIX FORTY THREE SEVENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON HAS REJECTED ALLEGATIONS OF SCAREMONGERING AND HYPOCRISY DURING HIS FIRST SET PIECE TELEVISION APPEARANCE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN HILLARY CLINTON'S LAUNCHED A SCATHING ATTACK ON HER CHIEF RIVAL FOR THE WHITE HOUSE DONALD TRUMP HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID IN A SPEECH IN CALIFORNIA
SOMEONE WHO SHOULD EVER HAVE THE NUCLEAR CODES BECAUSE IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE DONALD TRUMP LEADING US INTO A WAR JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT UNDER HIS VERY THIN SKIN
SHE ALSO SINGLED OUT HIS DIPLOMATIC RECORD HE PRAISES DICTATORS LIKE VLADIMIR PUTAIN AND PICKS FIGHTS WITH OUR FRIENDS INCLUDING THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THE MAYOR OF LONDON THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO AND THE PULP
HE SAYS HE HAS FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HE RAN THE MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT
JOHN SABLE AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR AND I ASKED ABOUT HER COMBATIVE APPROACH WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT A DETAILED FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH WELL FORGET FOREIGN POLICY THIS WAS PERSONAL AND THE CLIPS WE WE'VE JUST HEARD LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF OTHER BITS DONALD TRUMP'S IDEAS ARE NOT JUST DIFFERENT THEY'RE DANGEROUSLY INCOHERENT THEY'RE NOT EVEN REALLY IDEAS JUST A SERIES OF BIZARRE RANTS PERSONAL FEUDS AND OUTRIGHT LIGHTS AND SHE SAID HE IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT
TO BE PRESIDENT AND SO SHE CARRIED ON VERY MUCH IN THAT VEIN I REALLY TOOK THE FIGHT HIM AND I SHOULD SAY AND THIS IS THE KIND A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN I THINK REALLY DELIGHTED DEMOCRATS SUPPORTERS WHO WERE STARTING TO WORRY THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS MAKING ALL THE RUNNING AND HILLARY CLINTON LOOK FLAT FOOTED I THINK SHE WAS UTTERLY WITH THE RING
IN HER ASSAULT ON HIM AND GOT A LOT OF LAUGHS AND A LOT OF APPLAUSE AND KIND OF I THINK ACTUALLY MAY HAVE HIT HOME ON A FEW OF THE ATTACKS ABOUT TRUMP
TEMPERAMENT SUITABILITY NUCLEAR CODES COMMANDER IN CHIEF
HOW IS SHE DOING THERE IN HER FIGHT WITH BERNIE SANDERS I THINK SHE SEES THE FINISHING LINE IN SIGHT IN THERE I THINK SHE'S EXPECTING THAT COME NEXT TUESDAY WHEN CALIFORNIA VOTES WHEN YOU JERSEY VOTES THAT SHE WILL HAVE THE NOMINATION WRAPPED UP AND OF COURSE
SHE'S BEEN LOCKED IN A FIGHT WITH BERNIE SANDERS THESE PAST FEW MONTHS WHAT THEN TENDS TO HAPPEN AS WE'VE SEEN ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AMID WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL START TO UNITE ROUND HILLARY CLINTON THE BATTLES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT WITH BERNIE SANDERS WILL BE FOOT PUT BEHIND THEM AND THEY WILL CONCENTRATE ON DONALD TRUMP AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT WAS KIND OF ALMOST
AS IF DONALD TRUMP WANTED TO LET OFF SOME KIND OF MINOR EXPLOSION IN THE HALL WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WAS SPEAKING IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT PAUL RYAN THE MOST SENIOR ELECTED REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAD FINALLY DECIDED THAT O.K. GRUDGINGLY
I'M GOING TO BACK DONALD TRUMP TRAMPLE THOSE ENDORSEMENTS GO SAYING WE HAVE MORE COMMON GROUND THE DISAGREEMENT WAS HARDLY RINGING HOW DID HE DONALD TRUMP RESPOND TO HILLARY CLINTON AND THIS
MUTED IT WAS ANOTHER TWEETS OF CROOKED HILARY AND SHE'S NOT REALLY SUITABLE SHE LOOKED STRANGE READING THE TELEPROMPTER AND DIDN'T REALLY LOOK THAT GOOD BUT ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THERE WAS THAT MUCH I MEAN DONALD TRUMP HAS GOT A NEW BATTLE HE'S OPENED UP A NEW FRONT WITH A FEDERAL JUDGE OF MEXICAN HERITAGE WHO IS JUDGING THE CASE ABOUT TRUMP UNIVERSITY DONALD TRUMP'S SAYING HE IS NOT A FIT PERSON BECAUSE OF HIS ETHNIC BACKGROUND
SHOULD BE JUDGING THIS CASE THIS IS A FEDERAL JUDGE I THINK THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GRUDGINGLY COME ROUND TO SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP WILL BE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR HIM TAKING THAT TONE AGAIN

WELL ALAN BUCKLEY AND DONOVAN GARDNER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME I THINK THIS JUSTIN THANK YOU
THAT WAS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN RISKING ALL BEING RUN OVER BY TRACKED MINUTES SEVEN SORRY REPEATING THE DINER REMEMBER THE ROW ABOUT HOW MANY CHARRED REFUGEES SHOULD BE ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTRY THE GOVERNOR'S MEL B. BUT THE COST OF CARING FOR THOSE THAT HAVE AND ARE COMING HERE
COULD LEAD TO HIGHER COUNCIL TAX BILLS OR CUTS TO SERVICES SCHEME TO DISPERSE CHILDREN AROUND THE COUNTRY IS DUE TO BEGIN NEXT MONTH OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HAS THE STORY ROSS COUNCILS ARE EFFECTIVELY TELLING THE GOVERNMENT ART THEY PAY UP
WE NEED THE MONEY THEY'RE DOING PRECISELY THAT AND WHAT MATTERS IS HOW THAT ROW YOU REFER TO ENDED BECAUSE AT THE END OF IT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ADMITTED TO TAKE CHILDREN FROM BEYOND THE E. U. THREE THOUSAND OF THEM IT HAD AGREED TO TAKE CHILDREN FROM WITHIN THE E.U. AND ON TOP OF THAT THE ONE HUNDREDS LOOKING FOR ASYLUM ALREADY HERE AND BEING CARED FOR LARGELY IN KENT BECAUSE THEY ARRIVED AT DAVE AND HEADING TO WEST LONDON BECAUSE THEY ARRIVED AT HEATHROW A MINISTER'S PLAN TO DISPERSE THOSE CHILDREN AROUND THE COUNTRY STARTING
FROM NEXT MONTH AND THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS WHO PAYS HER WHERE DID THESE CHILDREN ACTUALLY GO TO BE CARED FOR NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFERING COUNCILS A HIGHER RATE TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WHO I KNEW THE ARRIVED OVER FORTY ONE THOUSAND AND THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO COUNCILS ABOUT THAT FOR SOME WEEKS BUT SOME COUNCILS ARE SAYING THE REAL COST IS FIFTY THOUSAND AND THAT THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP DAVID SIMMONS IS THE CONSERVATIVE DEPUTY LEADER OF HILLINGDON COUNCIL DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION
HE MAKES THIS CASE NOW HE SAYS THE NUMBERS THAT BRITAIN CAN ACTUALLY TAKE AFTER THAT REAL WILL DEPEND ON FUNDING AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER FINANCIAL SHORT FILM WILL BE FELT BY TAXPAYERS
UNLESS THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE SYSTEM WILL NEED TO SEE EITHER INCREASES IN COUNCIL TAX TO PAY FOR SUPPORTING REFUGEE CHILDREN OR WE'LL SEE LOCAL COUNCILS CUTTING OTHER SERVICES NO COMMUNITY NO LOCAL COUNCILLORS WANT TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE ENSURE THAT OUR SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR REFUGEE CHILDREN
FULLY AND PROPERLY FUNDED IF THEY DON'T GET THE FUNDS THAT THEY WANT ROSS IS IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE COUNCILS COULD WOULD THEY ALSO SIMPLY REFUSED TO TAKE REFUGEE CHILDREN YOU'LL SOME HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT IT'S NOT BE MUCH NOTED BUT NORTHAMPTONSHIRE FOR INSTANCE HE SAID LOOK THE PRESSURE'S ON OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR SOCIAL CARE RESEARCH THAT WE SIMPLY WE CAN'T DO THIS
FOR YOU BUT A CHANGE IN THE LAW THERE'S COME TOWARDS QUITE RECENTLY MEANS THAT ALTHOUGH MINISTERS DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THEY COULD FORCE COUNCILS TO ACCEPT THESE CHILDREN AND WHATEVER THEY DECIDE THE SIMPLE LEGAL REALITY UNDERPINNING THIS WHOLE DEBATE IS IF YOU TURN UP ON BRITISH SOIL AND YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN THAN THE COUNCIL WHERE YOU ARE HAS TO CARE FOR YOU
YES THEY WENT TO A HOME FOR CHILDREN SEEKING ASYLUM IN WEST LONDON AND WE'RE GOING TO CALL SARA WHO FLED A FORCED MARRIAGE IN IRAN AND FISH SHALL BE KILLED BY HER FAMILY IF SHE GOES BACK AND SHE DESCRIBED TO ME TURNING UP AT HEATHROW A SEVENTEEN WITH NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY NO CONNECTIONS AND NO LEGAL RIGHT TO COME HERE EITHER
I WAS JUST CRY BUT THEY WERE LIKE WHY ARE YOU DOING HERE WHAT DO YOU WANT I WAS LIKE I COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH FIRST OF ALL I THOUGHT THEY'RE GOING TO LIKE FOR ME IN PRISON COS I WAS LIKE A LEGAL HERE AND I WAS I HAVE ANY PASSPORT DOCUMENTS WITH ME
I GOT SO SCARED BUT THEN GO TALK TO ME DON'T WORRY YOU'RE UNDER AGE WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT YOU DONG BRUNO ONE OF INHERENT SHE'S PLANNING TO GO TO UNIVERSITY DOWN A MONTH ON FROM THAT POLITICAL ROW YOU MENTIONED THE SIMPLE FACT IS HOW THESE CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR WHO PAYS AND WHERE THEY GO IT'S NOT YET SUBTLE

GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE THIRD OF JUNE DAVID CAMERON AS FACE HOSTILE QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS RECORD ON IMMIGRATION DURING HIS FIRST SET PIECE TELEVISION APPEARANCE OF THIS E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
M.P.S ARE WORN THAT THOUSANDS OF RELEASED PRISONERS WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEPORTED BACK TO OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES ARE STILL WALKING THE STREETS OF BRITAIN
AND THE JAPANESE BOY LEFT IN THE FOREST BY HIS PARENTS AS A PUNISHMENT SIX DAYS AGO HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY CHARLES CARROLL
DAVID CAMERON HAS CONCEDED THAT IMMIGRATION IS AN ISSUE OF CONCERN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BUT SAYS IT CAN BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION SPEAKING AND A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION ON SKY NEWS THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO TRY TO BRING THE NET MIGRATION FIGURE DOWN BY QUITTING THE SINGLE MARKET HIS CLAIMS WERE MET WITH SCEPTICISM FROM SECTIONS OF THE STUDIO AUDIENCE AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON REPORTS
DAVID CAMERON ADMITTED THAT IMMIGRATION WAS A BIG CHALLENGE BUT CONSISTENTLY ATTEMPTED TO MOVE HER LAST NIGHT'S DISCUSSION ON TO WHAT HE SAW AS THE SAFER TERRITORY OF THE ECONOMY BUT IN THE END HE ARGUED THAT FREE MOVEMENT OF WORKERS WILL NOT CLAIMANTS WAS A PRICE WORTH PAYING TO SECURE ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET
IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH IS WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WANT TO DO YOU WILL FUNDAMENTALLY DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY THAT CANNOT BE THE RIGHT WAY OF CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION IT'LL MAKE OUR ECONOMY SMALLER IT WOULD COST JOBS WOULD BE POORER AS A COUNTRY
AND THE PRIME MINISTER TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME OF HIS CAMPAIGNS PERCEIVED NEGATIVES ETON EDUCATED PRIME MINISTER INSISTED THAT THE REMAIN CAMP WASN'T THE VOICE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AFTER OLD JEREMY CORBIN AND THE T.U.C. WANTED TO STAY IN TOO AND THE REPEATED THIS SCEPTICAL AND SOMETIMES DOWNRIGHT HORSETAIL QUESTIONING FROM THE AUDIENCE HE DENIED SCAREMONGERING
HE SAID HE WAS GENUINELY WORRIED ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING THE E.U. HE ATTEMPTED TO INJECT THE PASSION CRITICS SAY HAS BEEN LACKING IN THE CAMPAIGN BY APPEALING TO PARENTS NOT TO ROLL THE DICE WITH THEIR CHILDREN'S FUTURE THE PRO BREAKS IT ENERGY MINISTER ANDREA LEAD SOME SAID SHE WAS SHOCKED BY MISTER CAMERON'S PERFORMANCE IN A TELEVISION FORMAT HE HAD ASKED FOR SHE SAID THAT HE'D FAILED TO MAKE THE ECONOMIC CASE FOR IMMIGRATION HAND DEMONSTRATED THE WEAKNESS OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGNS ARGUMENT
A CROSS PARTY GROUP OF EM PEASE HAS WARNED THAT THE PUBLIC WILL QUESTION THE POINT OF THE U.K. REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T EVEN DEPORT CRIMINALS BACK TO OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES IN HER REPORT THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS THE EQUIVALENT OF A SMALL TOWN IF RELEASED FOREIGN CRIMINALS ARE WALKING THE STREETS OF BRITAIN AT THE TOP THREE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN ARE ALL WITHIN THE E.U. HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD
M.P.S BELIEVE FOREIGN NATIONALS SHOULD BE REMOVED QUICKLY AT THE END OF THEIR SENTENCE OR EVEN DURING THEIR SENTENCE IF THEY CONSERVE THE REMAINING TIME IN PRISON IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW CLOSE TO SIX THOUSAND CONVICTED CRIMINALS ARE STILL LIVING IN BRITAIN EVEN AFTER THEIR RELEASE FROM PRISON
TODAY THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE EXPRESSED ITS PARTICULAR FRUSTRATION AT THE NUMBER OF E.U. PRISONERS IN THE U.K. THE THREE NATIONALITIES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF POLAND IRELAND AND ROMANIA WITH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED BETWEEN THEM
THE M.P. SAID ONE ADVANTAGE OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD BE THE EASY REMOVAL OF CRIMINALS TO OTHER MEMBER COUNTRIES AND THE CLEAR INEFFICIENCIES IN THE SYSTEM WOULD LEAVE THE PUBLIC TO QUESTION THE POINT OF THE U.K. REMAINING A MEMBER OF THE E.U.
THE HOME OFFICE SAID THREE TIMES MORE EUROPEAN CRIMINALS WERE BEING REMOVED COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO
A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY AND JAPAN WHOSE PARENTS LEFT HIM IN THE FOREST AS A PUNISHMENT SIX DAYS AGO HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE IT'S EMERGED THAT YOUR MOTOR TO KNOCK ON'T SHELTERED INSIDE HER HEART AT AN ARMY TRAINING BASE WITH ACCESS ONLY TO WATER SUPPLIES ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE ROADSIDE WHERE HE WAS LEFT ALONE HE'S NOW BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS PARENTS MORE DETAILS FROM MARIE QUOI
IT'S BEEN NEAR THE WEEKS HIS SEVEN YEAR OLD A YOUNG MODEL TUNNEL CAR WAS ABANDONED IN A DENSELY FORESTED AREA THAT PAIN TO WILD BEARS HATES WERE FADING OF FINDING HIM ALIVE BUT IN WHAT SOME ARE CALLING A MIRACLE THE BOY WAS FOUND UNHARMED AND IN GOOD HEALTH
HIS FATHER INITIALLY TOLD POLICE HIS SON GOT LOST IT DURING A FAMILY HIKE BUT HE LATER ADMITTED THAT HE AND HIS WIFE LEFT THEIR SON IN MOUNTAINS AND DROVE OFF AS A PUNISHMENT FOR THROWING STONES
WHEN THE PARENTS RETURN TO FIVE MINUTES LATER YAMATO WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THERE'S BEEN GROWING CRITICISM AGAINST THEIR PARENTS WITH SOME ACCUSING THEM OF CHILD ABUSE
DONALD TRUMP'S BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS WON THE BACKING OF HIS PARTY'S MOST SENIOR ELECTED POLITICIAN THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PULL RYAN MY ORION WHO PREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO SUPPORT HIM OR SAID HIS GOAL WAS TO UNITE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO WIN THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER HILLARY CLINTON HAS USED HER SPEECH IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE A SCATHING ATTACK ON MISTER TRUMP AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOAP OR REPORTS
THIS WAS A KEENLY AWAITED FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH BUT FOREIGN POLICY PLAYED SECOND FIDDLE TO A HIGHLY PERSONAL ATTACK ON DONALD TRUMP HE WAS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT SAID HILLARY CLINTON OR MIGHT WELL START A NUCLEAR WAR IF SOMEONE GOT UNDER HIS VERY THIN SKIN
HIS IDEAS WERE DANGEROUSLY INCOHERENT SHE WENT ON A BLEND OF BIZARRE RANTS PERSONAL FEUDS AND OUTRIGHT LIES AND SHE SAID HE CLAIM TO A FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HE RAN THE MISS UNIVERSITY BEAUTY PAGEANT IN RUSSIA
BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DELIVERING THIS CORUSCATING ATTACK CAME WORD THAT MISTER TRUMP HAD FINALLY WON THE SUPPORT OF THE MOST SENIOR ELECTED REPUBLICAN IN THE LAND THE HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN MY RIDE SAYING WE HAVE MORE COMMON GROUND THAN DISAGREEMENT HARDLY THE MOST FULL THROATED POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT THERE'S EVER BEEN
FLOOD WATERS IN PARIS ARE EXPECTED TO PEAK ON THE RIVER SEINE THIS MORNING THE ROOF THE WORLD'S LARGEST MUSEUM HAS BEEN CLOSED ALONG WITH ROADS AND BRIDGES RESIDENTS OF ONE SUBURB WERE MOVED FROM THEIR HOMES BY LIFEBOATS FLOODS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY HAVE KILLED AT LEAST TEN PEOPLE JAMES REYNOLDS REPORTS FROM PARIS
A GREY DRIZZLE COVERS PARIS THIS MORNING AND THE FRENCH CAPITAL IS NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE RIVER SEINE IT'S LEVEL IS EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS THE AUTHORITIES HAVE CLOSED A NUMBER OF BRIDGES THEY'VE ERECTED EMERGENCY BARRIERS ALONG THE RIVER BANKS AND THEY'VE BANNED TOURIST BOATS FROM SAILING ON THE RIVER
THE CITY'S TWO MOST FAMOUS MUSEUMS THE LOUVRE AND THE MUSIC JUST SAY I'M NOT FAR FROM THE BANKS OF THE SEINE BOTH INSTITUTIONS SAY THAT THEY'RE TAKING THE PRECAUTION OF REMOVING ARTWORKS STORED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BASEMENTS
HEAVY RAINS HAVE ALSO AFFECTED AREAS OUTSIDE PARIS MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND HOMES HAVE LOST POWER THE TOWN OF NO MORE HAS BEEN CUT IN TWO BY THE FLOODS RESIDENTS HAVE TO USE CANOES TO GET FROM ONE PART TO THE OTHER
WORLD POWERS WILL ATTEND TALKS IN PARIS TODAY TO TRY TO REKINDLE PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS NEITHER SIDE IS TAKING PART AT THIS STAGE IT'S HOPE THE MEETING COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR A MIDDLE EAST PEACE CONFERENCE LATER IN THE YEAR THERE'S A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED THE MEETING BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT ONLY INTERNATIONAL ACTION CAN RESCUE THE SO CALLED TWO STATE SOLUTION THAT'S THE IDEA THAT THE KEY TO PEACE IS SETTING UP AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINE ALONGSIDE ISRAEL POWER AMONG THE PALESTINIANS ARE STILL SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN MOVEMENTS FATTER AND HAMMER US EVEN IF A DEAL WAS POSSIBLE WITH ISRAEL THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THEIR COMMITMENTS WHILE THEY REMAIN SPLIT
ISRAEL'S PRIME MINISTER MISTER NETANYAHU SAYS HE WANTS DIRECT TALKS WITH THE PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT MATT A BASS NOT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT MISTER NETANYAHU WANTS A DEAL BECAUSE OF HIS RECORD AND THE MAKE UP OF HIS GOVERNMENT IT'S DOMINATED BY STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF JEWISH SETTLEMENT IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES WHERE THE PALESTINIANS WANT TO CREATE A STATE
A RARE AMERICAN STAMP STOLEN MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS AGO HAS BEEN RETURNED TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER THE TWENTY FOUR SAINT INVERTED JENNY FEATURES A BIPLANE MISPRINTED UPSIDE DOWN IT WAS TAKEN FROM A DISPLAY CASE IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE IN APRIL A MAN FROM NORTHERN IRELAND TOOK IT TO AN AUCTION HOUSE KEELEY NO NEIL WHO'S SINCE RECEIVED A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REWARD SAID HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE HELPED SOLVE THE MYSTERY
I TAKE THIS MOMENT TO SAY WHAT AN HONOUR TO BE ABLE TO RETURN AND DENNISTOUN AMERICAN THOUGHT SLAVERY AND HAD TO STAB MY GROUND FOR IRELAND AND I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THE HISTORY AND IMPORTANCE OF STYLE
UNTIL VERY RECENTLY AND LAND OF THE TENT TESTING BACK AS ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE A.P.R. THE F.B.I. AND THE TAN IS ARTHUR'S PROBABLY RETURN STAMPED IT'S RIGHTFUL OWNER
KEELAN O'NEILL THERE IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE ARE THIRTEEN THOUSAND CONVICTED CRIMINALS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE U.K. THAT'S THE SIZE OF A SMALL TOWN ACCORDING TO M.P.S ON THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE HAVE WARNED THAT FAILURE TO REMOVE THEM IS UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM MORE THAN HALF OF THAT NUMBER IN PRISON BEING LOOKED AFTER AT SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE TAXPAYER WILL BE JOINED BY KEITH AS HE CHAIRS THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE AND BY JOHN A TARGET IN THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING TUBA BUT REMAINING
OF ALL WHAT IS GOING WRONG HERE WHY ARE THESE FOREIGN NATIONAL OFFENDERS NOT BEEN REMOVED BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BANGING ON ABOUT THIS UNDER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN CHAIRING THIS COMMITTEE THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS SEEMS TO HAVE CONFRONTED THE HOME OFFICE THE FIRST IS THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SOME COUNTRIES TO TAKE THEIR CITIZENS BACK
BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S WHY WE SUGGESTED TWO YEARS AGO BUT AT SENTENCE FOREIGN NATIONAL OFFENDERS SHOULD GIVE UP THEIR PASSPORTS AND THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THEM WHEN THEY COME OUT OF PRISON SHOULD START ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
WE ALSO URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS BEST TO TRY AND GET THEM OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT COSTS FORTY THOUSAND PER PRISONER TO KEEP THEM IN PRISON BUT WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT IS THERE OVER FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED WHO FINISH THEIR SENTENCE
ARE LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEREFORE NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER THEY CAME TO STAY OR BE DEPORTED MANY RESPECTS THERESA MAY HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING HOME SECRETARY I'M AFRAID IMMIGRATION AND THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISONERS HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A ACHILLES HEEL FOR THE HOME OFFICE
AND THEY NEED TO GET A GRIP FIRST OF ALL TALKING TO OUR E.U. COLLEAGUES MAKING SURE THAT AT LEAST TO START OFF WITH CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME IN THE E.U. AND E.U. COUNTRIES TAKE THEIR CITIZENS BAG BUT ALSO THERE ARE FOUR COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE TOP TEN COUNTRIES LIKE JAMAICA PAKISTAN OR NIGERIA WE NEED AN INDIA AND WE NEED TO USE OUR BEST END UP AS TO CONVINCE
COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES TO DO THEIR BIT AND TAKE THEIR CITIZENS BACK OTHERWISE IT IS A HUGE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYER AND IT'S KIND OF A GREEN LIGHT WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WE MUST SAY IN PRIME MINISTERS HAD IT MANY MANY TIMES MOST RECENTLY IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR BUT THIS IS A GROUP THAT HE WANTS TO SEE OUT OF THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO LACK OF PASSION
ON THE PART OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE HOME SECRETARY THERE'S JUST A LACK OF ACTION IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE ONCE THEIR SENTENCE THEY'RE REMOVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND OF COURSE CHARLES CLARKE THE LABOUR HOME SECRETARY RESIGNED OVER THIS OR AT LEAST THE LOSING OF A THOUSAND FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISONERS PRISONERS THAT WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IS A BIT OF A HISTORY HERE AS WELL ABSOLUTELY YOU'VE REMINDED US AND THAT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND PRISONERS BEING ALLOWED OUT OF PRISON
I'M NOT BEING CONSIDERED FOR DEPORTATION SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE SEVENTH WILL FIVE THOUSAND NOT COME BACK LET ME BRING IN JOHN OUT OF HERE WHOSE NATIONAL OFFICER AT THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION IS IN A RADIO CAR MISSED OUT AT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS GOING WRONG AS FAR AS THE PRISONS ARE CONCERNED WHY IS IT THAT YOU CANNOT EITHER REMOVE THEM SO THEY CAN SERVE THEIR SENTENCE AT A DIFFERENT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE OR REMOVE THEM WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR SENTENCE
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRISONS TO ACTUALLY REMOVE THEN THE U.K. BORDERS AGENCY IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY PRISON GOVERNORS TO HOLD THEM IN CUSTODY AND TO DO WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM WHILE THEY'RE THERE BUT ONCE THEY'VE SERVED THEIR SENTENCE THEN IT'S UP TO HER SAY U.K. P.A. AND TO GO THROUGH THEIR PROCESSES AND REMOVE THEM IN A TIMELY FASHION AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PRESUMABLY WHEN SOMEBODY'S COMING UP TO THE END OF THEIR SENTENCE YOU LET THE BORDER AGENCY KNOW
ABSOLUTELY THE WHOLE PROCESS SENTIENT CALCULATIONS PAPERWORK AN AREA IS OFFERS THE VERY ANSWER AND VERY OFTEN WE SEND THE PAPERWORK OFF AND THEN WE SIMPLY WAIT FOR HER TO GET A RESPONSE FOR US I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THE IMPACT IT HAS ON PRISONS
THE SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT REFERS TO A EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT THAT THAT WE'RE HOLDING PRISONERS FROM AND WE TALK ABOUT POLAND IRELAND AN ALPINE IF EXAMPLE
AND THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO OF THOSE PRISONERS ALONE POTENTIALLY COULD BE TRANSFERRED BACK IN TERMS OF THE COST TO PRISONS EVEN JUST PROVIDING MEALS FOR THOSE PRISONERS TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TO PRISON FOR ONE YEAR
COST THE TAXPAYER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION POUND A YEAR AND PRISON GOVERNORS ARE PROVIDING MEALS FOR FOR PRISONERS AT A COST OF ONE POUND NINETY SIX PER DAY
THAT'S THE WHOLE OF THE THREE MALES SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL BUDGET WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY THERE MICHAEL GO VEE SAID WHAT'S MATE PRISON GOVERNORS AUTONOMOUS AND PRISON GOVERNORS ARE KEEN TO DO THAT BUT THEY ALSO BECOME ACCOUNTABLE
AND THAT ACCOUNTABILITY BECOMES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IF THE RESOURCES THAT PRISON GUNS HAVE GOT A BEEN DIVERTED AND THERE IS TO BE SPENT ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND DOMESTIC PRISONERS
RIGHTS AND THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHITTLE THAT TOTAL OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN THOUSAND THEM IN PRISON THAT'S A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE PRISON PROPPED POPULATION WHICH PRESUMABLY MAKE OVERCROWDING IS IT
AT THE FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISON POPULATION I THINK IS SOMEWHERE AROUND TWELVE PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE PRISON POPULATION AND THAT WAS ON THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MONKEYS YOU MAKE THE BOYS IN EVERYBODY'S INTEREST THAT THIS HAPPENS PRESUMABLY APART FROM THE COUNTRIES THEY SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO WHAT COULD BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT
ACTUALLY THAT CHANGES AND THEY TAKE THEIR THEIR OWN NATIONALS BACK FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE E.U. AS YOU KNOW I'M IN FAVOUR OF US STAYING IN THAT I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER'S MAKING A STRONG CASE FOR US TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AFTER THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE BECAUSE WE'VE NOT MANAGED TO DO IT YET IS TO GO TO PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TUSK AND TO TELL HIM WE NEED AN E.U. DIRECTIVE TO MAKE SURE COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND OF WHICH HE WAS THE PRIME MINISTER
TAKES THEIR CITIZENS BACK WE NEED TO GO TO THE COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA NIGERIA AND JAMAICA
AND TELL THEM THAT IN ORDER TO DO EFFECTIVE DEALS WITH US THIS IS GOING TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR AGENDA SO WE'VE GOT TO LINK THIS WITH THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHICH IS AS JOHN I THOUGHT HE SAID IT'S COSTING A FORTUNE
TWELVE PERCENT OF THE PRISON POPULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REFORMING PRISONS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO OVERCROWDED AND ONE OF THE REASONS HIS WE HAVE SO MANY FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISONERS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WILLING THIS IS A HUGE PASSION TO TRY AND GET THIS DONE BUT I THINK IT IS THE MECHANICS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE IN PARLIAMENT KEEP ON THE BACKS OF MINISTERS
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AND THE HOME OF THE HOME OFFICE START TO GROW THE HOME OFFICE DOES SAY THAT THREE TIMES MORE EUROPEAN CRIMINALS ARE BEING REMOVED NOW COMPARED WITH FIVE YEARS AGO AND THERE IT IS GRAND IT IS INCREASING PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO POLISH PRISONERS WHAT IT'S A BIT OF US A SNAIL'S PACE I THINK FOR GOOD FROM THE FIGURE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IT WAS FORTY FOUR LAST YEAR BUT THIS EXCUSE AS FAR AS THE E.U. THIS CONCERNED HERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME AND PRISONERS HAD TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY KEITH AS JONATHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN YOU GET A BETTER DEAL IF YOU'RE INSIDE THE ROOM THAN OUTSIDE AT THE MESSAGE FROM GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL COULD SCARCELY HAVE BEEN OR DON'T EXPECT AS GOOD A DEAL AS YOU HAVE NOW IF YOU VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. HER INTERVIEW HER INTERVENTION FOLLOWS THAT OF THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER WHO WARNED THAT IF A POST BRECK'S IT BRITAIN LIMITED E.U. IMMIGRATION BRITISH CITIZENS WOULD FACE SIMILAR KERBS
AND THAT OF THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER WHO SUGGESTED THE BRITS IN SPAIN MIGHT LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO LIVE IN HIS COUNTRY SO DAVID CLEMENTS FELLA E.U. LEADERS BEGINNING TO PANIC UNTIL RECENTLY RELICS OF COURSE HE USED TO SIT AT THOSE SUB IT TABLES IN BRUSSELS HE WAS POLAND'S FOREIGN MINISTER AND HE JOINS US ON THE LINE MORNING TO YOU MY SCHOOL SKI GOOD MORNING EASE PANIC SETTING IN IN THE CAPITALS OF EUROPE
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK HIS FEELINGS OFF FRIENDLINESS TOWARDS BRITAIN AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY RESPECTS BRITISH PEOPLE'S DECISION TO GO EITHER WAY BUT IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE MORE IMPORTANT AS AN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES AS A MEMBER AND IMPORTANT POLITICIANS ON THE CONTINENT SAY THE SAME
WHEREAS THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA CHEERS YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY TOWARDS BRICKS IT YOU'RE FREE TO DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS HE'S NOT VERY FRIENDLY TO SAY DON'T YOU DARE EVEN THINK ABOUT IT WILL BE DREADFUL CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DO NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE TONE THE TONE IS RESPECTFUL COS THE TONE OF CONCERNED FRIENDSHIP WE ARE FRIENDS YOU ARE FREE TO MAKE A MISTAKE BUT WE WOULD PREFER YOU NOT TO
YOU SAY MAKE A MISTAKE MANY PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS NOW IT WOULDN'T SUIT POLAND GERMANY AND OTHER COUNTRIES IF WE LEFT BUT IF THE U.K. DID LEAVE THEN SUDDENLY MAGICALLY ALL THESE PROBLEMS WERE MELT AWAY AND IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL BECAUSE IT BEEN YOUR INTERESTS AND IT BE ENOUGH
BUT REMEMBER WE REMEMBER WITH WITH GRATITUDE THE FACT THAT BRITAIN SUPPORTED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OH WHICH BENEFITED ASKED THANKS STORAGE WE WE JOINED AND WE ARE NOW TELLING YOU YOU KNOW YOU HELPED US TO GET IN
HE'S STAYING BECAUSE YOU ARE A VITAL VOICE FOR LIBERAL MARKETS FOR A STRONGER FOR DEMOCRACY AND ALL THOSE OTHER GOOD THINGS HAVEN'T OF COURSE BRITAIN WE'LL MANAGE OUTSIDE BUT THE QUESTION IS WILL YOU BE MORE INFLUENTIAL YOU KNOW WHEN I GO TO LONDON I ASKED BRITISH BRANDS WHAT IS THE FIRST DECISION YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR COUNTRY TO MAKE AFTER YOU'VE LEFT
BET YOU CAN'T MAKE NOW BUT GOOD BE EUROPEAN UNION IS PREVENTING YOU FROM TAKING CUT EMIGRATION I SUSPECT MOST PEOPLE WOULD SHOUT
I HAVE NOT YET ONCE HAD A COHERENT PERSUADES A CUT IMMIGRATION MANY VOTERS WOULD SHARE WOULDN'T IT WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MAJORITY OF YOUR IMMIGRATION IS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. AND ALSO LEADS TO RECOVER A BIT KIND OF CONTROL
BET EUROSCEPTICS TALK ABOUT YOU WOULD NEED TO LEAVE BOOTH THE E.U. AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA IN OTHER WORDS GO COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF THE NORWAY OR SWITZERLAND SCENARIOS THAT WOULD BE A VERY DRASTIC MOVIE LAST THOUGHT YOU WERE AT OXFORD WITH BORIS JOHNSON YOU KNOW BORIS EXTREMELY WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIS CAMPAIGN
I'M VERY FOND OF BORIS BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON THIS ONE I THINK AS MAYOR OF LONDON HE KNOWS HOW MUCH BENEFIT
BRITAIN LONDON BOROUGH BRITAIN CRAWL FROM BEING INTERNATIONAL FROM THE PASSPORT IN RITES OF BRITISH BANKS THE CITY ON THE CONTINENT SO I HOPE DAVID CAMERON WINS AND BORIS LOSERS IN A WORD IS NICK CLEGG RIGHT HE CALLS IN TRUMP WITH US THAT SAW US THIS MORNING
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT I RESPECT OR OR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR VIEWS CLEAR I JUST THINK THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS BETTER WITH BRITAIN
RELICS OF COURSE THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AT THE EPSOM DERBY THIS WEEKEND AND UP TO EIGHTY BILLION POUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE BET THEN ROB YEUNG HAS MORE ON THAT ROCK YES GOOD MORNING AT IS SUMS OF MONEY LIKE THAT WHICH MAKE THE EPSOM DERBY THE SINGLE BIGGEST RACE OF THE FLAT RACING SEASON BUT THERE IS A TENSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOOKIES AND THE SPORT WITH US OR SIMON BASIL JET THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE JOCKEY CLUB WHICH RUNS EPSOM RACE COURSE ALONG WITH ABOUT A DOZEN OF US GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW IS BUSINESS SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING PRETTY WELL
BUSINESS IS DOING VERY WELL THE MORE WE FOCUS ON GIVING PEOPLE A GOOD EXPERIENCE AND A GREAT SPORTS EVENTS LIKE THE DERBY WILL BE THE GREATEST GREATEST RACE IN THE WORLD IT HAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT IN TERMS OF THEIR BREEDING THAT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED TOMORROW WITH THE OAKS TODAY SO SO IT'S FANTASTIC REVENUES GROWING HOSPITALITY GROWING AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE REPUTATION OF THE SPORT GROWING BUT YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU GET FROM THE BOOKIES
IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE A MUCH MORE MIXED ECONOMY THE REST THE WORLD IT'S IN THE REST OF THE WORLD THEY'RE VERY DEPENDENT ON BETTING MONEY BETTING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US BUT THE WAY IT'S THE WAY THE MONEY IS TRANSFERRED FROM BETTING TWO RACING IS FLAWED IF IF A BETTING OPERATOR IS OFFSHORE THAN THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO US AND THAT'S CREATED DIFFICULTIES FOR US IN TERMS OF CORE FUNDING BUT THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF FIXING THAT DOT IS BEING REFORMED AND BY MID EARLY TO MID NEXT YEAR THAT THAT RELATIONSHIP WILL BE REFORMED AND YOU'LL GET MILLIONS OF POUNDS MORE
THE ESTIMATES ESTIMATE IF THAT IF OFFSHORE BETTING OPERATORS WERE PAYING AT THE SAME RATERS ONSHORE THERE'LL BE ABOUT THIRTY MILLION POUNDS AN EXTRA TO BE PAID FOR RACING WHETHER WE ACHIEVE THAT OR NOT IS STILL TO BE SEEN BUT WHAT IT WHAT IT WOULD REALLY DO IS CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THAT ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH BOOKMAKERS TO GROW THE WHOLE BUSINESS WHEREAS AT THE MOMENT
THE THE NEW CHANNELS DIGITAL CHANNELS WHICH TEND TO BE OFFSHORE DON'T PAY AND THAT CREATES A KIND OF A VERY KIND OF THE WRONG BALANCE IN TERMS OF HOW WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS ISN'T YOUR RELATIVE THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU GET FROM THE BOOKIES AND RACE COURSES SHOULD JUST BE SELF SUFFICIENT AND STAND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET WELL WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT WE GROW OUR REVENUE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WE'VE GRAN A MEDIA RIGHTS WE'RE GOING HOSPITALITY WE GROW THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE
SPONSORSHIP ALL THESE AREAS HAVE GROWN THE ONE THING WE CAN'T CONTROL IS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO PAY OR NOT FROM THE BETTING OPERATES I ONCE THAT HAPPENS AND WE CAN CONTROL THAT I THINK THEN THEN IT'S FOR US TO WORK WITH THE BETTING INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE WE COME UP WITH THE BEST SOLUTION FOR BOTH SITES AND I THINK WE'LL DO THAT OWNING A RACEHORSE THAT WIND BRITISH RACIST IS A IS A PRESTIGE PRIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD WOULD LIKE HAS THE DOWNTURN IN THE OIL PRICE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN RUSSIA CHINA ELSEWHERE HAD AN IMPACT ON THE INVESTMENT LEVELS COMING FROM ABROAD
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE A GREAT SUPPORTER OF INWARD INVESTMENT INTO THE U.K. FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD OBVIOUSLY WELL KNOWN IN THE GULF STATES BUT BUT OTHER PARTS FROM NORTH AMERICA FROM THE FAR EAST AND WE THINK THAT'LL CONTINUE THAT'LL SUPPORT ECONOMIC OR ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THIS COUNTRY OF OVER THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS WE ONLY SEE THAT GROWING REALLY OH K. KEEP SUMMER BASIL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE JOCKEY CLUB
THANKS VERY MUCH ROB TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY HAS BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS PARENTS SIX DAYS AFTER THEY ABANDONED HIM IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA IN NORTH JAPAN HE WAS FOUND IN AN ARMY TRAINING BASE ABOUT FOUR KILOMETRES FROM THE ROADSIDE WHERE HIS PARENTS HAD LEFT HIM AS A PUNISHMENT FOR THROWING STONES AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HIS FATHER TACKY YOU KEATON EUCHRE APOLOGISED FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED YEAH CALL ABOUT ME

PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VOICING SOME SYMPATHETIC VIEWS TOWARDS THE PARENT OF THAT IF THE BOY WAS THROWING STONES AND WASN'T LISTENING TO THEIR PARENTS MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS THE RIGHT THING TODAY BUD LEAVING HIM ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS WAS DEFINITELY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE AGREES THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY A STEP TOO FAR MERRICK OI THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THERE'S A LOT OF EUROPEAN MONEY THAT COMES IN AND OUT OF THERE
I WILL BE VOTING TO STAY I HAVE SEEN PROJECTS THAT WOULD SAY THAT THEY'VE BEEN FUNDED BY MONEY
I THINK FIND IT
BUT YOU'VE SEEN ENOUGH FOR THEM TO MAKE IT LOOK TO YOU AS IF THERE ARE BENEFITS FROM BEING IN THE IT LOOKS LIKE
BECAUSE WE'VE PUT MONEY INTO THESE
WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE PUT THEIR MONEY
INTO DEVON AND CORNWALL BEFORE AND DID IT OVER TO THOSE BRUSSELS PEOPLE
TREY GO MALES IS THE KULA IN SOME WAYS HE'S GOT A KIND OF SLIGHTLY KITSCH FIELD WHERE THERE ARE COCKERELS RUNNING AROUND THERE ARE WATER FEATURES THERE'S A HUGE VOTE LEAVE POST
A STATUE OF THE EMPEROR NERO AND JUST LOOKING DOWN TO THE INSCRIPTION UNDERNEATH IT IT SAYS NERO ONLY FIDDLE
EUROCRATS PRACTICE GRAND LARCENY OR CLUE
AS TO THE VIEW OF EUROPE HELD BY THE BOSS BRUCE ROBERTS
EVEN BY THE E. USE OWN MEASURES IT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WE'RE STILL DEPRIVED MY VIEW WOULD BE THAT
OUR OWN M.P.S WOULD BE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF MAKING A STRONG CASE FOR PRECISELY WHAT CORNWALL NEEDS IN OUR OWN PARLIAMENT WESTMINSTER RATHER THAN HAVING A FEW EMMY PLEASE WHO COVER FROM THE SCILLY ISLES TO SOUTHAMPTON WERE INVARIABLY IN A MINORITY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE ARE
IN A PARLIAMENT OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE ISN'T IT SIMPLY THAT WITH THE Y. YEARS THERE ARE SET RULES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DEPRIVATION THERE HAS TO BE FOR YOU TO GET
AND IF IT WERE DONE AT WESTMINSTER THERE WOULDN'T BE THOSE SET RULES IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT POLITICS AND YOU WOULD BE COMPETING WITH CENTRAL MANCHESTER WITH SCOTLAND WITH ALL SORTS OF OTHER AREAS AND ALSO ONE
YOU WOULDN'T GET WE'RE NOT RECEIVING SO MUNIFICENT BOUNTY WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING BACK A SMALL ELEMENT OF WHAT WE PAY YOU IN AND WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT YOU'RE GUESSING AN UNDER WESTMINSTER YOU MIGHT NOT
WE'RE GUESSING AT THE MOMENT BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO SAVE THAT COULD CHANGE
COME BACK TO PICTURESQUE CORNWALL NOW THIS IS POLE CHARIS BEACH AND IT'S A LOVELY SIGHT CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE WATER LOVELY SUNSHINE AND ALL THE REST OF IT WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS THIS EVERYONE EXCEPT THAT THIS ISN'T ENOUGH CORNWALL CAN'T SURVIVE AND PROSPER IN THE FUTURE BY TOURISM
BUT DOES THE MONEY COME BEST FROM EUROPE OR COULD IT
AS THOSE IN THERE LEAVE CAMP SUGGEST FROM WESTMINSTER DOCTOR JOANIE WILLETTS WORKS FOR EXETER UNIVERSITY BUT IN THE PENRHYN CAMPUS HERE AND
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT WE WOULD GET MONEY FROM WESTMINSTER WE HAVEN'T IN THE PAST HISTORICALLY WE REALLY HAVE NOT ALL OF THEIR REGIONAL INEQUALITY MEASURES THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DO THEY'RE ALL FOCUSING ON THE NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTH WEST AND EVEN FEWER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT CORNWALL IN PARTICULAR
IS THERE MONEY ARGUMENT GOING TO SETTLE IT IN THE END WELL WHAT WE'VE GOT A SENSE OF IN A DAY OR TWO OF TALKING TO PEOPLE HERE IS THAT ACTUALLY OTHER THINGS MATTER TO A KIND OF SENSE OF SOVEREIGNTY SENSE
OF IDENTITY WHETHER YOU SEE THAT IDENTITY IS BEING EUROPEAN OR WHETHER YOU SEE IT VERY MUCH BASED HERE IN BRITAIN IT'S THAT FEELING THAT GUT FEELING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU BELONG BUT FRANKLY SEEMS TO BE DECIDING PEOPLE HERE JUST AS MUCH AS THE MONEY
JUST IT'S SPLASHING ABOUT IN CORNWALL WHERE IT'S TWENTY TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE F.T. LEAD WITH THE CLOSURE OF B.H.S. IT DESCRIBES THE STORE CHAINS COLLAPSE AS ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS CORPORATE FAILURES IN YEARS HIGHLIGHTING QUESTIONS EVER WYATT WAS SOLD LAST YEAR TO A MAN WHO'D BEEN DECLARED BANKRUPT AND HAD NO RETAIL IMMIE EXPERIENCE IN ITS ANALYSIS SECTION THE F.T. DESCRIBES HOW THE FIRM'S FORMER HIGH STREET COMPETITORS AND NOW JOSTLING TO MY BRANCHES AND B.H.S. CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST LUCRATIVE PLACES
THE DAILY MIRROR BELIEVED THE BUSINESS COULD HAVE BEEN RESCUED BUT PAID THE PRICE FOR BEING WOEFULLY DEPRIVED OF INVESTMENT THE BUSINESS EDITOR OF THE I. ELIZABETH ANDERSEN WRITES THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS EXPECTED BY MANY IT WAS A BRUTAL SHOCK TO B.H.S. STAFF AND SHE DESCRIBED AN INCIDENT AT ONE BRANCH IN LONDON IN WHICH AN EMPLOYEE WENT TO THE TOILET AND RETURN DIVIDE THAT THE SHUTTERS HAVE BEEN LOWERED AND HE WAS LOCKED IN
THE DAILY MAIL BELIEVES THAT AFTER THIS LATEST COLLAPSE IN THE CLOSURE OF AUSTIN REED EARLIER THIS WEEK BRITAIN IS NOW FACING A CRISIS ON THE HIGH STREET NUMBER PAPERS ARE UNIMPRESSED BY YESTERDAY'S INTERVENTION BY THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE OF COURSE THE TIME SUGGESTS THAT SILENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHREWDER THERE PLEASE OR MISSUS MERKEL ANOTHER SAYS HIS LEADER FEEDS INTO A RESIDENT LEAVE ARGUMENT THE RUN THAT EUROPE IS RUN BY ELITES FOR ELITES AND THE CLUB IS CLOSING RANKS TO SUPPORT ONE OF ITS OWN MISTER CAMERON
MISSUS MERKEL SUGGESTION THAT BRITAIN WILL BE BETTER OFF NEGOTIATING WITHIN THE E.U. RATHER THAN OUTSIDE THE ROOM INCENSES THE SUN OUR PRIME MINISTER TRIED BEING IN THE ROOM IT SAYS HE WAS SENT HOME WITH A FLEA IN HIS EAR THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MIRROR IS MUHAMMAD ALI IS RUSHED TO HOSPITAL THE PAPER SAYS THAT SUPPORTERS FLOODED IN FOR THE FORMER WORLD CHAMPION BOXER AS DOCTORS IN THE UNITED STATES TREAT HIM FOR BREATHING PROBLEMS FOR SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD CONDITION IS DESCRIBED AS
AS A RECCE FORCES PUT PRESSURE ON ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS IN THE CITY OF FALLUJAH THE GUARDIAN CONSIDERS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF I S. SUFFERS SUDDEN MAJOR DEFEATS IN BOTH SYRIA AND IRAQ THE PAPER EXPRESSES CONCERN THAT IF THE MILITANT GROUP IS DRIVEN OUT TOO QUICKLY THE AIR IT'S OCCUPIED MAY LAPSE INTO A STATE OF DANGEROUS INSTABILITY
THE QUICKER I S. FALLS WITHOUT A PLAN FOR WHAT COMES NEXT SAYS THE GUARDIAN THE MORE REAL THE THREAT OF AN IRREVERSIBLE SPLIT ALONG SAY ETHNIC SECTARIAN LINES AMONGST COMMUNITIES THAT HAD MANAGED TO CO EXIST AND FINALLY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS UPSET ABOUT THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S NEW PLASTIC FIVE POUND NOTE WHICH WE'RE GOING TO CIRCULATION LATER THIS YEAR
WHAT EVERYDAY ITEM IS IMPROVED BY BEING MADE OF PLASTIC ASKS THE PAPER'S LEADER WHO PREFERS A PLASTIC CLOTH ON THE TABLE TO LINEN THE PAPER SEEMS ESPECIALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE NEW NOTES AND THEY STICK TOGETHER WHICH IT DESCRIBES AS REPULSIVE THE EXPRESS WELCOMES THE FACT THAT THE FACE OF WINSTON CHURCHILL WILL ADORN THE NEW FIVER DESCRIBING HIM AS A PRIME MINISTER OF NOTE AS DECISION GOES IT CONCLUDES THIS WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY
THERE ARE A THOUSAND WAYS TO READ THE MONA LISA'S MOST FAMOUS ENIGMATIC SMILE TODAY SHE'LL LOOK ON AS OTHER ARTWORKS IN THEIR LUV ARE REMOVED PART OF AN EMERGENCY PLAN AS FLOODWATER IS TAKEN THE RIVER SEINE TO SIXTEEN FEET ABOVE ITS NORMAL LEVEL
FLOODS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY HAVE ALREADY CLAIM TEN LIVES AND FORCED THOUSANDS FROM THEIR HOMES I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO JEAN HASN'T BUILT DIRECTOR OF THE SHATTERED A SHOWER MORE IN THE LOIRE VALLEY WHICH ITSELF HAS BEEN BADLY AFFECTED
WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE CHATEAU DES ARE GONNA PREVENT IN CASUALTIES ALL REWARDS ON THE PIE WE ARE CLOSED AND WE HAD SOME PORTIONS OF RULES WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY BY THE STRENGTHS OF THE REIVERS
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ARTWORK AT THE SHELTER JEAN BOUGHT APPEARS TO BE SAFE BECAUSE THE WAY THE CASTLE IS BUILT BUT HE'S THE ARTWORK SAFE AT THE LOUVRE AND ELSEWHERE IN PARIS A CORRESPONDENT JAMES REYNOLDS CAN TELL US HOW ANXIOUS ALL THAT JAMES I HOPE THEY PUT THEIR CRISIS PLAN INTO OPERATION NICK WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IF NOT ANXIOUS THEY WANT TO BE A HEAD OF ANY FLOOD WATERS WHICH COME THEIR WAY YOU'LL ALL KNOW OF COURSE AT THE LOUVRE IS PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE SEINE ITSELF AND THEY'RE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE ARTWORKS IN THE BASEMENT A SECURE SO THEY'VE SHUT THE MUSEUM TODAY THEY'RE MOVING THOSE ART WORKS AWAY FROM THE BASEMENT AS ANYONE WHO'S VISIT THE LOUVRE WILL KNOW THE MONA LISA HERSELF SHE LOOKS DOWN FROM A TOP FLOOR SHE IS SAFE SHE'S STAYING WHERE SHE IS THAT SHE IS I THINK WILL BE INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET RID OF HER FROM THERE BECAUSE SHE'S BEHIND BULLET PROOF GLASS PROTECTED BY SEVERAL GUARDS AND FLANKED BY CROWDS AND CROWDS OF TOURISTS WHENEVER SHE'S OPEN
MORE SERIOUSLY OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN DEATHS NOT JUST IN FRANCE IN GERMANY AS WELL YET TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN FRANCE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE FRENCH MEDIA'S REPORTING OF A SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD MAN WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT WHEN HE TRIED TO CROSS A FLOODED FIELD AN EIGHTY SIX YEAR OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN KILLED BEFORE MAYBE SEVERAL DEATHS IN GERMANY AS WELL WE KNOW THAT IN FRANCE MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS WE BELIEVE HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT POWER THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SKIES NO DOUBT LISTENING TO THEIR WEATHER FORECASTERS WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS
CONTINUING DRIZZLE HERE IN PARIS IT'S INCREDIBLY GREY AND PEOPLE ARE DOING TWO THINGS FIRST WE LOOK AT THE SKY TO SEE IF THE RAIN'S GOING TO COME AND THEN THEY LOOK AT THE CENTRE SEE IF IT'S GOING TO GET ANY HIGHER WHEN YOU GO TO THE BRIDGE IS IT IS PRETTY DRAMATIC BOATS CANNOT PASS UNDER THE BRIDGES COS THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THEM IT'S PREDICTED THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE SAME WILL REACH ITS PEAK AROUND MIDDAY TODAY JAMES
THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN OUR STUDIO HERE IN LONDON THIS MORNING THIS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE FREE TO BAN MUSLIM WOMEN FROM WEARING HEADSCARVES AT WORK IF THEY HAVE A GENERAL POLICY BARRING ALL RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL SYMBOLS THAT WAS THE OPINION OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL THIS WEEK AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE MATTER FOR A FINAL RULING WILL BE GIVEN BY THE HIGHEST COURT LATER THIS YEAR BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
I KNOW MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE EFFECT WEARING A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL CAN HAVE ON OTHER PEOPLE FOR I USUALLY WEAR A CLERICAL COLLAR PURPLE SHIRT AND CROSS
THIS IS NOT A NEUTRAL FORM OF ADDRESS IT AROUSES REACTIONS POSITIVE HOSTILE OR AMUSING I'VE BE STOPPED BY A YOUNG COUPLE AND ASKED FOR A PRAYER AND BLESSING
ON ANOTHER OCCASION TAKING YOUTH GROUP TO FRANCE AND OLE LADY PUSHED OFFICER IN MY FACE WITH AN EXPLETIVE AND TOLD ME TO GET BACK TO ENGLAND
AND I LIKE THE STORY OF A FORMER ARCHBISHOP WHO JUMPED ON TO THE PLATFORM WITH ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED DOUBLE DECKER BUSES TO BE SHOUTED AT BY THEIR CONDUCTOR OI YOU ROBIN REDBREAST GET UPSTAIRS
SO WHEN WE SEE ACROSS THE SIKH TURBAN OR A JEWISH KIPPER OR UP MUSLIM HEADSCARF WE DON'T SEE THEM NEUTRALLY AND THEY WILL BRING OUT A PARTICULAR SET OF ASSUMPTIONS AND FEELINGS THESE WILL DEPEND PARTLY ON THE STEREOTYPES WE HAVE IMBIBED FROM OUR OWN CULTURE AND PARTLY FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE OF THAT RELIGION WITH ITS BEEN A POSITIVE OR A NEGATIVE ONE
IT'S CERTAINLY THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRISTIAN CLERGY THAT PEOPLE PROJECT ONTO THEM ALL KINDS OF ASSUMPTIONS SO THAT THEY'RE EITHER SEEN AS MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE OR FAR WORSE
WE CAN'T AVOID HAVING SOME PREFORMED FOR YOU OR FEELINGS THAT COME TO MIND WHEN WE SEE A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO IS BE AWARE OF THEM THEN ASK UH SAYS WHERE THEY COME FROM
WHETHER THEY'RE RATIONAL AND THEN REMIND OURSELVES QUITE SIMPLY THAT WE ARE SEEING SOMEONE WITH SIMILAR FEARS AND HOPES TO OUR OWN
JESUS STRESS THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE OF HOW WE SEE THE OTHER PEOPLE THE LAMP OF YOUR BODY IS THE EYE HE SAID AND ELSEWHERE BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD
ONLY IN PURITY OF HEART WE SEE NOT ONLY GUARD BUT OTHERS AS THEY SHOULD BE SEEN CLEANSE THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION CENTRE POET WILLIAM BLAKE
PERSONALLY I'M VERY GLAD THAT WE HAVE A MUCH MORE RELAXED ATTITUDE TO RELIGIOUS DRESS IN THIS COUNTRY COMPARED TO FRANCE BUT WHATEVER THE EUROPEAN COURT FINALLY DECIDES THE LAW DOES NOT GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER THAT IS HOW WE SEE OTHERS AND HOW FAR ARE WE PREPARED TO FLUSH OUT ALL FALSE ASSOCIATIONS SO THAT WE SEE THEM AS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS AND FROM A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW AS BEARING THE DIVINE IMAGE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE BISHOP OF RICHARD HARRIS THE TIME NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AFTER WEEKS OF TRYING TO FIND A BUYER THE ADMINISTRATORS OF B.H.S. HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWN THE DEPARTMENT STORES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE SHOPS WILL CLOSE
EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AND ANOTHER THREE THOUSAND YOU'RE NOT DIRECTLY EMPLOYED WILL FIND THEIR ROLLS UNDER THREAT AND WHAT ARE THEIR PENSIONS NOT DAD SOME FROM STOCKTON ON TEES JOINED THE COMPANY JUST AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL AND STARTED SAVING FORTY POUNDS PER MONTH INTO HIS PENSION HE LEFT THE COMPANY IN TWO THOUSAND TO BUT HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIS SAVINGS
I AT THE PENSION WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN I THOUGHT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO SAVE FROM OUR OLDER AGE RETIREMENT AND I SERVE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TEN YEARS AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WILL HAPPEN TO THE PENSION SO I'M OBVIOUSLY QUITE CONCERNED WHEN I JOINED THE COMPANY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY I THOUGHT I HAD A FUTURE I REALLY DID AND I THOUGHT THE PENSION WOULD PROVIDE FOR ME AND NOW OBVIOUSLY IT WON'T
HE'S WORRIED COS YOU DO HAVE TO PUT OUR FAITH IN PENSIONS AND PENSION PROVIDERS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THINGS CHANGE QUITE QUICKLY MARK DADS AND THERE WELL WE SPEAK TO THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF MARKS AND SPENCER'S IN THE FORMER CITY MINISTER LORD MANNERS JUST A MOMENT FIRST THEY ONE HAVE A SHAH IS RETAIL CORRESPONDENT AT THE SUNDAY TIMES AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THAT OF HOPE I MADE THE THE TAXPAYER WILL
LARGELY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO HAVE PENSIONS WITH THE COMPANY BIG VIA THE UP AT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WON'T THEY WELL I BELIEVE HE'S ACTUALLY OTHER PENSIONERS EFFECTIVELY YOUR BAIL IT OUT BECAUSE THE P. P. F. IS FUNDED BY A LEVY ON OTHER FINAL SALARY PENSION FUNDS SO EFFECTIVELY OTHER PENSIONERS WILL BAIL OUT UNDERSTOOD PENSIONS O.K. BUT AS FAR AS FAR AS MARK DATSUN CONCERNED THERE HE IS WORRIED ABOUT HIS PENSION HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE
THAT'S FINE UNLESS YOU'RE BUGGED BEEN IT BENEATH RETIREMENT AGE RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE BELOW RETIREMENT AGE AS A TEN PERCENT CUT AND THERE'S ALSO A CAP OF THIRTY GRAND A YEAR ISH SO THERE ARE STILL CUTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE CERTAIN AGES AT THE TOTAL COST OF THE PENSION PROBLEM AND IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AS I UNDERSTAND IT WAS SIR PHILIP GREEN HAS OFFERED SOME MONEY HASN'T IT COULD HE BE ASKED TO TO PUT IN MORE TO FILL THAT GAP AS WE UNDERSTAND IT HE MADE AN INITIAL OFFER OF EIGHTY MILLION
A FEW MONTHS AGO WE THINK HE'S TRIED TO RAISE THAT A FEW TIMES THAT'S NOT BEEN CONFIRMED WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT I GUESS WHETHER HE VALUES HIS REPUTATION OR HIS WALLET MORE
THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS FRAME NOW I THINK HE'S AN APOLOGY AND A BIG PAYMENT OR CONTRIBUTION OF SOME KIND TOWARDS THE PENSION FUND BECAUSE HE DOES IN YOUR VIEW SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED I THINK THAT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THEM IN THERE THERE ARE TWO STORIES WITH B.H.S. OBVIOUSLY THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENTS CHANGED HUGELY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE RISE OF NIMBLE ARRIVALS LIKE PRIMARK
ZAREH SHOPPING HABITS HAVE CHANGED BUT ALSO IN THE EARLY YEARS OF PHILIP GREEN'S OWNERSHIP TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR HE AND HIS PARTNERS TOOK OUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PLUS OF DIVIDENDS MORE CAME OUT IN RENT AND MANAGEMENT CHARGES TO ASSOCIATED COMPANIES THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WEAKENED B.H.S. JUST BEFORE THE MARKET STARTED CHANGING SO UNABLE TO INVEST IN NEW STORES NEW PRODUCTS STAFF TRAINING THAT WEEK IN THE COMPANY AND
IT'S A MEN THE COMPANY WAS LESS LIKELY TO SURVIVE IN LONG TERM AND BEAM AND THE COMPANY COULDN'T AFFORD ANY HIGHER REPAYMENT SINCE THE PENSION DEFICIT OH CAME ON THE SHOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH WERE LISTENING TO THAT IS LORD MINUSES AS I SAY WHO USED TO BE CHAIRMAN OF MARKS AND SPENCER'S AND WAS A CITY MINISTER GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN NOW WITH SIR PHILIP GREEN AND THIS AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PERHAPS HOLDING HIM TO SOME SOME ACCOUNT FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED
I THINK IT'S PRETTY INDISPUTABLE SIR PHILIP MUST TAKE SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED HERE NOT LEAST OF ALL SELLING THE BUSINESS TO MISTER DOMINIC SHOULD PEARL
WHICH WAS RATHER LIKE GIVING THE KEYS OF YOUR CAR TO A FIVE YEAR OLD AND ALLOWING THE FIVE YEAR OLD TO GO OFF AND CRASH THE CAR
IT'S A GREAT SHAME THAT SIR PHILIP DIDN'T SEEK TO RECTIFY THAT BY RE TAKING CONTROL OF THE COMPANY FROM MY PEARL BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH CAN HAPPEN FAIRLY IMMEDIATELY MISTER HAS PUT HIMSELF AT THE FRONT OF THE CREDITORS CUE HE'S GOT SECURITY FOR THE MONEY THAT HE HAS LENT TO B.H.S. HE COULD GIVE UP THAT SECURITY MAKE SURE THAT MONEY IS USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF EMPLOYEES AND PENSIONERS AND NOT CLAIM TO BE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE
SECONDLY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INQUIRIES GOING ON BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BY THE PENSIONS REGULATOR AND BY THE INSOLVENCY SERVICE AND THEY WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED BUT ON THE FACE OF IT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF B.H.S. OVER RECENT YEARS NOT INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS NOT PAID HIM FOR THE PENSION FUND AND THE COMPANY HAS RUN INTO THE WALL
WE MUST GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHY THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS EMPLOYEES SUPPLIERS AND PENSIONERS ISN'T ENTIRELY YOU SAYS THEY'RE GIVING THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD THE KEYS TO THE CAR BUT YOU FORMER PEOPLE WHO SELL COMPANIES CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY YEARS AFTER WITH WHAT THE SUBSEQUENT OWNER DOES
THAT'S WHAT'S AFOOT SAID WHEN HE WHEN HE SOLD THE BUSINESS HE SAID IF I IF I SELL MY PLANE TO SOMEBODY THEY FLY INTO THE NEAREST EXPLETIVE MOUNTAIN IT'S NOT MY FAULT ALMOST AS THOUGH HE REALISED THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN I THINK YOU DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
AS A STEWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPANY IS IN SAFE HANDS WHAT HAPPENED HERE HAD BEEN THAT THE TAXPAYERS GOING TO PAY REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS WILL HAVE TO COME FROM THE TAXPAYER OTHER PENSION FUNDS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE PENSION SCHEME AND INNOCENT SMALL SUPPLIERS TO B.H.S.
COULD SEE THEIR BUSINESS COLLAPSE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING PAID FOR THE GOODS THEY'VE SUPPLIED SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WASH YOUR HANDS OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COMPANY AFTER YOU'VE SOLD IT BUT HOW I MEAN ONE WONDERS HOW LONG THAT RESPONSIBILITY CAN GO ON FOR I MEAN I KNOW YOU COULD ARGUE THIS CASE IT'S ONLY A YEAR I WANT IT I MEAN SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU'VE HAD YOUR RUN INS WITH SIR PHILIP IN THE PAST NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE ATTEMPT ON MARKS AND SPENCER AND WHETHER YOU'RE AN ENTIRELY FAIR JUDGE
ELLE I AM INFORMED BY EXPERIENCE WHEN SIR PHILIP BID FOR MARKS AND SPENCER HE WAS INSISTENT ON GAINING ACCESS TO THE PENSION FUND AND HE SAID WITHOUT THE DATA THAT HE WOULD GET FROM THE PENSION FIRM HE WOULDN'T PROCEED WITH THE BITS OF SIR PHILIP UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING OVER A COMPANY WITH A LARGE PENSION FUND HE DIDN'T SUCCEED AND I HAVE TO SAY THANK GOODNESS HE DIDN'T RECEIVE SO I DIDN'T SUCCEED BECAUSE
IF HE HAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO MARKS AND SPENCER SO YES I YES I DO HAVE A VIEW AND I'M NOT I'M ASHAMED
WILLING TO TO ADMIT THAT BECAUSE I THINK BUT I THINK THEY'RE A VERY BIG ISSUES HERE ABOUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND IT NEEDS FULL AND PROPER AN IMMEDIATE INQUIRY OF COURSE WE'RE FOCUSING ON SIR PHILIP GREEN HERE BUT THE COMPANY WAS OWNED BY HIS WIFE
DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE CALLED BEFORE THESE COMMITTEES WELL I THINK THAT'S A VERY INTRIGUING BECAUSE AS WE GO THROUGH THE EVIDENCE WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED IN FRONT OF IT IS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS EVER REFERRED TO THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS THEY'VE ALWAYS ASSUME WHEN THEY WERE IN DISCUSSIONS THAT SIR PHILIP WAS THE OWNER
FRANK FIELD THE CHAIRMAN OF THE WORKS AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE ORIGINALLY INVITED LADY GREEN TO GIVE EVIDENCE BUT THEN AT THE REQUEST OF SIR PHILIP SAID HE WOULD BE CONTEMPT AT LEAST TILL HE UNDERSTOOD THE STORY BETTER
JUST TO RECEIVE EVIDENCE FROM SIR PHILLIP I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT FRANK FIELD IS CURRENTLY RE VISITING THAT CONCLUSION AND ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER HE SHOULD
SPEAK TO THE ORGAN GRINDER OF AND THERE IS THERE IS OF COURSE ANOTHER PERSON INVOLVED HERE SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN IN FRONT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE LORD GRAB NOW WHO WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RETAIL EMPIRE NOW YOU'RE USED TO BE CHAIRMAN OF MARKS AND SPENCER'S HE SAYS THAT HE WASN'T PRESENT AT THE MEETING FOR THE SALE OF THE COMPANY AND HE HADN'T SEEN ANY OF THE PAPERS
WELL I THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY I THINK IT WILL WE WERE THERE A NUMBER OF PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH PROPERTIES WERE SOLD OUT OF B.H.S. IN SOME CASES TO SIR PHILIP AND TO OTHER PEOPLE
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER TONY WAS AT THOSE MEETINGS AS WELL MY SUSPICION IS WE'LL FIND THAT B.H.S. HAD A VERY INFORMAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BUILT AROUND THE COURT OF PHILIP GREEN
RATHER THAN BEING RUN IN THE WAY HE MIGHT SAY
AN EXPLETIVE COMPANY LIKE MARKS AND SPENCER LORD MINERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THE WEATHER JAY WYNNE IS HERE THANKS NICK GOOD MORNING AND HAVE HAD A WESTIE SPLIT ACROSS THE U.K. FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT CONTINUES THROUGH THE DAY TODAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ACROSS THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE U.K. LIGHT WINDS AS WELL VERY PLEASANT HOWEVER FURTHER EAST WE'VE GOT A WEAK WEATHER FRONT COMING IN FROM THE NORTH SEA THAT'S GONNA BRING SOME CLOUD AND SOME PATCHY RAIN WITH IT SO I THINK THE RAIN WILL BE THAT BIT HEAVIER ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH EAST IN PARTICULAR COULD EVEN BE A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER SO JUST BE AWARE A VET'S WHEREAS IN THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND WILL BE FINE WITH SOME SUNSHINE

DAVID CAMERON ADMITTED THAT IMMIGRATION WAS A BIG CHALLENGE BUT CONSISTENTLY ATTEMPTED TO MOVE HER LAST NIGHT'S DISCUSSION ON TO WHAT HE SAW AS THE SAFER TERRITORY OF THE ECONOMY BUT IN THE END HE ARGUED THAT FREE MOVEMENT OF WORKERS WILL NOT CLAIMANTS WAS A PRICE WORTH PAYING TO SECURE ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET
IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH IS WHAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WANT TO DO YOU WILL FUNDAMENTALLY DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY THAT CANNOT BE THE RIGHT WAY OF CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION IT'LL MAKE OUR ECONOMY SMALLER IT WOULD COST JOBS WOULD BE POORER AS A COUNTRY
AND THE PRIME MINISTER TRIED TO ELIMINATE SOME OF HIS CAMPAIGNS PERCEIVED NEGATIVES ETON EDUCATED PRIME MINISTER INSISTED THAT THE REMAIN CAMP WASN'T THE VOICE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AFTER OLD JEREMY CORBIN AND THE T.U.C.

POLAND IRELAND AND ROMANIA THEY COMMITTEE'S CHAIRMAN KEITH HAS SAID IT MEANT A GREAT HAND UNNECESSARY EXPENSE FOR TAXPAYERS
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AT FIRST OF ALL THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN PRISON AND THE NUMBERS WHO REMAIN IN OUR COMMUNITIES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY BY NOW

THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS IS USUALLY A VOCAL DEFENDER OF BUSINESS THIS MORNING IT IS ATTACK THE WAY B.H.S. HAS BEEN RUN ITS DIRECTOR GENERAL SIMON WALKER SAYS THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. SHOWS A LAMENTABLE FAILURE OF BEHAVIOUR FROM THE COMPANY'S FORMER DIRECTORS
THAT IS A VERY HIGH PROFILE BUSINESS LEADER HE'S THE PERSON IS ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH KATE MOSS ON HIS ARM AND WHO HAS ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUND SUPER YACHT AND SO ON WITH SOMEONE LIKE THIS ENDS UP BEHAVING LIKE THIS PEOPLE THINK THAT'S HOW BUSINESS IS AND IT'S NOT
SIMON WALKER ACKNOWLEDGED B.H.S.

A STUDY ON THE WHITENING ACADEMIC DIVIDE BETWEEN GIRLS AND BOYS SUGGESTS THAT THE ATTITUDES TO UNIVERSITY THEY ADOPT AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN HELPS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WILL GET A PLACE FIVE YEARS LATER
RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY SAID YOUNG CHILDREN WHO REGARDED UNIVERSITY AS A NATURAL GOAL WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO TAKE THREE A. LEVELS AND TO DO SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN OTHERS HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE STUDY WHICH FOLLOWED THE PROGRESS THROUGH SCHOOL OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN FOUND THAT AT THIRTEEN TWO THIRDS OF GIRLS THOUGHT IT VERY IMPORTANT TO GO TO UNIVERSITY COMPARED WITH JUST OVER HALF OF BOYS THE STUDY CARRIED OUT FOR THE SUTTON TRUST ALSO FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ASPIRED TO A PLACE AT UNIVERSITY COMPARED WITH THIRTY NINE PER CENT OF OTHER PUPILS
THE AUTHORS SAID POSITIVE ASPIRATIONS ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION WERE SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING BETTER A. LEVELS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S INVESTING IN HELP FOR DISADVANTAGED PUPILS TO BRING UNIVERSITY PLACES WITHIN THEIR REACH
RESEARCHERS SAY THAT YOUNG FISH ARE BECOMING HOOKED ON THE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF PLASTIC THEY SWALLOW IN THE OCEANS WRITING IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE THEY COMPARED IT TO THE PREFERENCE OF TEENAGERS FOR FAST FOOD THEY'VE SAID IT STRENGTHENS THE ARGUMENT FOR BANNING PLASTICS THAT END UP IN THE SEA OUR ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT MAGMA MCGRATH REPORTS
THE WORLD'S OCEANS ARE TEEMING WITH TINY PIECES OF PLASTIC MOST OF IT COMES FROM THE EIGHT MILLION TONS OF WASTE PRODUCED EVERY YEAR HE'S ALSO COMES FROM SMALL PLASTIC BEADS WIDELY USED IN COSMETICS WHATEVER THE SOURCE THE EFFECTS ON FISH AND BIRDS ARE OFTEN DEVASTATING SCIENTISTS OR UNSURE WHY MARINE SPECIES INGEST THESE DEADLY FRAGMENTS
THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT EXPOSURE OF PERCH EGGS TO PLASTICS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES THE FOOD PREFERENCES OF THE YOUNG FISH WHEN THEY'RE BORN THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED SAID IT WAS LIKELY THE SIGHT OR SMELL OF THE PLASTIC FRAGMENTS TRIGGERED THE FEEDING RESPONSE STUFFED WITH PARTICLES BEYOND PERCH WERE EASILY PICKED OFF BY PREDATORS
RESEARCHERS SAY IT STRENGTHENS THE ARGUMENTS FOR A GLOBAL BAN ON MICRO PLASTICS IN COSMETICS AND TOILETRIES
MATT MCGRATH REPORT IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT YOU DON'T CONTROL IMMIGRATION BY TRASHING THE ECONOMY THAT SINGLE PRIME MINISTERIAL SOUND BITE DEPLOYED LAST NIGHT IN THE FIRST BIG T. V. EVENT OF THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN CAPTURES WHAT FOR MANY THEIR CHOICE HAS COME TO BE ABOUT
ON THE ONE HAND IMMIGRATION WHICH IS RUNNING WAY ABOVE THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN TARGET HAS BECOME THE SYMBOL OF BRITAIN'S INABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN DESTINY IF WE STAY INSIDE THE E.U. ON THE OTHERS COME THE WARNINGS THAT LEAVING WOULD RISK AND I QUOTE MASS ECONOMIC HARDSHIP QUOTE THE WORDS THAT IS OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S FORMER DEPUTY A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT
NICK CLEGG WHO ENTERS THE FRAY IN A SPEECH HE'S DELIVERING TODAY HE JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER AS DOES THERESA VILLIERS THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A FORMER EMMY P. AND A. PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING GOOD MORNING NICK CLEGG FIRST OF ALL
I'VE GOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE CHOICE THIS IS IT EXCEPT WE CAN'T CONTROL IMMIGRATION COS IF WE TRY WE'LL TRASH THE ECONOMY
LORI I AGREE THAT BIRD THERE TO SORT OF CAMPS ARE SLUGGING IT OUT ON IMMIGRATION ON THE ONE HAND AN ECONOMY ON THE OTHER I THINK THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY A BIT PRETTY OBJECTIVELY HAS BEEN PRETTY COMPREHENSIVELY WON BY THOSE WHO SAY THERE'LL BE HUGE ECONOMIC DAMAGE AND UNCERTAINTY IF WE LEAVE ON IMMIGRATION IT'S A GOOD THING ACTUALLY IN MY OWN VIEW THAT IF THIS IS BEING DEBATED AS IT'S GOING TO VIGOROUSLY AS IT IS COS I WAS OLD FASHIONED BELIEF THAT IF YOU DEBATE SOMETHING THOROUGHLY
THE TRUTH WILL COME TO THE SURFACE AND ACTUALLY WHAT IS COMING TO THE SURFACE IS THAT PUTTING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WON'T END IMMIGRATION ACTUALLY IF YOU FOLLOW THE AUSTRALIA POINTS SYSTEM THEY HAVE TWICE AS HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION PER HEAD OF POPULATION THAN WE DO IT'S A TWO WAY STREET WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION BRITS WHO STUDY AND WORK AND RETIRE ELSEWHERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND US TO REASONABLE BUT FIRM AS TREES WERE CONFIRMED THE BRECHT'S AT CAMP EVEN BY THEIR OWN RECKONING HAVE A VERY FLAWED APPROACH BECAUSE THEY'LL THEY'LL CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR BUT I'LL KEEP THE BACK DOOR OPEN WITH THE OPEN BORDER
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ISLAND WHICH WILL JUST ALLOW EVERYBODY IN ANYWAY SO I OF YOUR BUZZER AND RECKONED THEY CAN'T CONTROL IMMIGRATION IN THE WAY I WANT TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOUR MESSAGE OR NOT A CONCERT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECORD EXACTLY WHAT DAVID HARE AND SAYS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR MESSAGE IS NOT ONLY CANNOT WE CONTROL IMMIGRATION IF WE STAY IN THE E.U. WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION YOU MAY DAY VOTER HAVE VOTED FOR THAT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BUT WHATEVER YOU DO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE IT
NO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHICH ARE VERY PRONOUNCED AND VERY STRONGLY HELD ARE NOT SOLVED BY SIMPLY YANKING OURSELVES OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN FACT AS AS I SAID IF YOU FOLLOW THE PRESCRIPTION NOT NOT OF ME NOT OF ANYONE NOT OF DAVID CAMERON NOT HAVE ANYONE ADVOCATING THAT WE SHOULD REMAIN BUT OF THE BRICKS IT CAMP THEMSELVES A ADVOCATE A MODEL WHICH IN AUSTRALIA HAS LED TO
TO LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION AND SECONDLY THEY THEY THEY WANT TO LEAVE HER BACK DOOR OPEN ANYWAY SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME BACK TO BRING THERESA VILLIERS INTO RESPOND TO THAT LET'S JUST BE CLEAR THERESA VILLIERS IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT BRITAIN SHOULD HAVE MUCH LOWER IMMIGRATION
ABSOLUTELY I WAS ELECTED ON A MANIFESTO WHICH COMMITS US TO BRINGING MIGRATION DOWN TO THE TENS OF THOUSAND SALE I WOULD YOU TO DO THAT IS JUST FRACTIONALLY ARE THERE MORE IMMIGRANTS THAT COME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM EUROPE
OR ARE THERE MORE IN IMMIGRANTS THAT COME FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. WELL AT THE MOMENT NON E.U. MIGRATION IS RUNNING AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER LEVEL THAN E.U. MIGRATION BUT THE KEY THING IS THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. THE COME FROM THE E.U. SO WHY ARE YOU CLAIMING AS A GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTROL IMMIGRATION
IS BY QUITTING THE YEAR BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DELIVER ON THAT MANIFESTO PROMISES IF WE TAKE BACK CONTROL OVER MAKING OUR OWN LAWS ON IMMIGRATION YOU COULD DO YOU COULD CONTROL AND CUT NON E.U. IMMIGRATION IF YOU CHOSE TO DO SO BUT YOU'VE CHOSEN AS A GOVERNMENT
NOT TO DO SO WELL ACTUALLY THE GOVERNMENT'S INTRODUCING PARIS METAL METHODS OF CONTROLLING NON E.U. MIGRATION BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S UNHEALTHY THAT AT A GENERAL ELECTION THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHOEVER YOU VOTE FOR THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
JUST CANNOT BE CHANGED THAT IT'S NOT HEALTHY AND I I FIND IT SHOCKING THAT NICK CLEGG WHO WAS A FORMER LEADER OF THE PARTY THAT HAS A PROUD HISTORY GOING BACK WELL OVER A CENTURY OF TRAMPLING DEMOCRATIC VALUES DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN IMMIGRATION NO WHAT IS A RIGHT TO LIVE UNDER LAWS MADE BY PEOPLE THAT WE ELECT IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WE CAN GET RID OF A GENERAL AT THAT POINT TO HIM IN JUST CAN BUT WHAT I THINK HE IS INDEED WHAT HE IS SAYING IS
YOU WILL NOT CUT IMMIGRATION THIS WAY YOU AS A GOVERNMENT HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IT WITH PEOPLE COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE E.U. YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING CERTAINLY BUT THERE IS A LOT OF IMMIGRATION YOU HAVE NOT CUT BECAUSE YOU'VE CHOSEN NOT TO BECAUSE A CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT AND THE CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT EITHER OF COURSE THOSE THERE'S A RANGE OF ACTIONS THAT WE ARE TAKING ON MIGRATION IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS REFORM AND OTHER METHODS OF CRACKING DOWN ON E. LIEB ILLEGAL MIGRATION
WE ONLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GET TO THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TARGETS IF WE CAN MAKE CHANGES TO FREE MOVEMENT AND THE E.U. WAS RESISTANT TO MAKING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO FREE MOVEMENT IT'S BETTER AND SAFER TO TAKE BACK DEMOCRATIC CONTROL AND HE WOULD DO THAT IF IT MEANT THAT WE COULD NOT BE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE SINGLE MARKET WELL IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CARRY ON DOING BUSINESS WITH THE KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT QUESTION WAS VERY CAREFULLY PHRASED IF YOU DON'T MIND WHICH IS
WOULD WE BE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE SINGLE MARKET WE WOULD HAVE A TRADE DEAL ON ON THIS VERY PROGRAMME THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID OF COURSE WE GET A TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. THEY SELL MORE TO US THAN WE DO TO THEM IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST TO CARRY ON DOING BUSINESS WITH US SO THE SCARE STORIES ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE E.U. MIGHT PULL UP THE DRAWBRIDGE AND REFUSED TO BUSINESS
ARE JUST NOT TRUE OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRADE WITH US AND WILL CONTINUE TO TRADE WITH THEM NICK CLEGG IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE AUDIENCE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER LAST NIGHT THE PEOPLE LOATHE WHAT THEY CALL SCAREMONGERING IN THE AUDIENCE YOU'RE GUILTY OF IT ON YOU AND YOUR SPEECH TODAY USE THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHRASE ABOUT MASS ECONOMIC HARDSHIP YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA WHETHER BRITAIN COULD GET BETTER TRADING HER RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE WE MIGHT WELL BE ABE I'M VERY FIRM IN MY VIEW THAT WHILST OF COURSE I ACCEPT THE FUTURE BY DEFINITION IS UNCERTAIN
NO ONE HAS A PERFECT CRYSTAL BALL I THINK IT IS IN CON SEAVER BOWL THAT YOU CAN QUIT WHAT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MARKETPLACE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION CONSUMERS AS A LEADING MEMBER OF IT AND GET BETTER TERMS THAN YOU HAVE BY BEING IN IT BUT IF YOUR DEFEATISM ISN'T GOING TO KNOW AFTER ALL YOU AND FRIENDS OF YOURS WERE SUPPORTERS OF JOINING THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE EURO ARGUABLY THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS ONE OF THE GREAT ECONOMIC FORECASTERS OF OUR ERA
NO I'M NOT I NEVER PRETEND TO BE A FORECAST WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE DECISION TO YANK OURSELVES OUT OF A CLUB OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN A LEADING MEMBER FOR LET'S REMEMBER FORTY ONE YEARS I THINK WOULD HAVE AND I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHY THAT WOULD HAVE SUCH A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON OUR ECONOMY AS A SUCCESSION OF NOT JUST THINK TANKS AN ECONOMIST BUT BUSINESS PEOPLE INCLUDING MANY BUSINESS PEOPLE IN THE ALL IMPORTANT SERVICES SECTOR TODAY YOU'VE PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE SERVICES SECTOR OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN SAYING REPEATEDLY AND YOUR FINAL WORD TO BOTH OF YOU WHAT YOUR VERY PERSONAL IN THE SPEECH THIS MORNING YOU DESCRIBE BORIS JOHNSON AS WHAT DO YOU GIVE AS THE PHRASE HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE IT I JUST SAID IT'S A SLIGHTLY THROWAWAY PHRASE THE BORIS JOHNSON'S SOMETIMES REMINDS ME OF DONALD TRUMP WITH A THESAURUS HE SPEAKS OBVIOUSLY WITH WITH GREATER PANACHE AND ELEGANCE AND DONALD TRUMP BUT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT HE AND OTHER POPULACE ACROSS THE DEVELOPED WORLD ARE DOING IS HE'S APPEALING TO PEOPLE'S FEARS
BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDING SOLUTION I WANT TO PUT THAT BACK TO THERESA VILLIERS THERESA VILLIERS THE CHARGES IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU ACTUALLY BORIS JOHNSON'S EXTREMELY WEALTHY MAD HE WON'T SUFFER IF WE GET OUTSIDE THE SINGLE MARKET BUT YOU AND HE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE SHOULD DO
I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP AT THE MOMENT ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON LOW WAGES IN LOWER SKILL JOBS BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME DEPRESSED BY MASS MIGRATION LEAVE THE LARGEST TRADING AREA IN THE WORLD AND YOU CAN WITH CERTAINTY CAN YOU SAY
NO ONE WILL SUFFER ECONOMICALLY WITH CERTAINTY WE WILL HAVE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION I'M IN ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND THEY ALL SORT OF ALL THOSE GLOOMY FORECAST EVEN WITH THEIR FRAUD ASSUMPTION EVEN WITH THEIR PESSIMISM ALL OF THEM SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GROWING IN THE LONG TERM THE ONLY DEBATE IS ABOUT BY HOW MUCH THERESA VILLIERS NEGLECT THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT TOMORROW AT EPSOM RACECOURSE IT IS INVEST TAKE DERBY FIRST RUN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY AND NOW ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS HORSE RACES IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN WILL PRESENT THE TROPHY TO THE WINNERS WITH A TOTAL PRIZE FUND AVAILABLE OF SOME ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS
LAST YEAR'S WINNER GOLDEN HORN HAS BEEN RETIRED TO A STUD FARM IN NEWMARKET WHERE THE HOPE IS THAT HE'LL PRODUCE AT LEAST ONE FUTURE WINNER MAYBE MORE WHAT HAVE THE CHANCE TO SAY ROB BONNET'S REPORTS
YEAH IT IS YES AND DERBY WINNER GOLDEN HAWK AND INTRODUCTION OF SHEIKH MOHAMMED'S DUNHAM HALL STUD TO GOLDEN HORN WHY THE INTEREST IN THE PEERS' RIGHT
O.K. I'LL BE THE FAVOURITE IN THE DERBY TORY LOOK UNBELIEVABLE ME TOO I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I CAN'T
GOLDEN HORNS TAIL APPEAR SOMEWHAT SHREDDED AND SHORTENED HE TENDS TO NIBBLE AWAY AT IT BUT OTHERWISE HE'S IN PERFECT PHYSICAL SHAPE FOR THE JOB IN HAND SAM BULLARD IS DIRECTOR OF STALLIONS AT ALLEN HALL SO YOU WOULD BE FED FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND THEN DURING THE ST COVERING SEASON THAT MAKE THEIR BREEDING SEASON
COVER A MARE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND HE MIGHT HAVE DURING THE DAY AND HE WOULD BE EXERCISED TO BE LED IN HAND FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AROUND THE ROADS HERE OF THE STUD BUT HE'LL BE KEPT PRETTY FIT SO WHAT WITH A COVERING ON THE EXERCISE AND ALL THAT IT'S UM WELL IT'S NO PICNIC IS IT GOING TO START I MEAN IT'S GOT A TIRING BUSINESS WELL I THINK THEY'RE QUITE A NICE TIME BUT THEY GOT TO WORK
AND THE NUMBERS HERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MARES WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO GOLDEN HORN DURING THE CURRENT BREEDING SEASON NINETY THREE PER CENT OF THOSE ALREADY COVERED HER IN FOAL SIXTY THOUSAND IS PAYABLE FOR EACH SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS THOROUGHBRED REPRODUCTION ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE ALBEIT WITH RIGOUROUS CHECKS ON HEALTH AND SAFETY DON'T LAIDLAW IS HEAD OF NOMINATION
AND SO YOUR MAN FROM IN HERE JUST BE WASHED
HAVE A TEAR BANDAGE PUT ON ALL THE MARES ARE WEAR THESE BOOTS ON THEIR HIND FEET JUST IN CASE SHE DOES KICK STALLIONS NO HORSE TO GET TO SOME OF THE MAYOR'S YOU PUT THIS COLOUR ON JUST TO GIVE US SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO
ALL THE MARES A TWITCH THAT PIECE OF STRING AT ALL HE'S TWISTED ROUND THE TOP LIP
OF A MAN AND IT ACTS ON A PRESSURE POINT AND RELEASES ENDORPHINS
AND THAT RELAXES THE MAYOR THEN YOU MAYORAL COME THROUGH HERE AND IF SHE HAS A FULL THE FOAL LICIOUS HELD IN THAT PEN OUT OF THE WAY AND THEN SHE'LL BE COVERED AND THE WHOLE PROCESS SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN ABOUT TEN MINUTES
BUT HOW DO YOU BREED ANOTHER DERBY WINNER THE GENETICS OR STAND IN A MARE ARE ONE THING BUT THEN IT'S ALSO ABOUT TRAINER AND TRAINING INVALUABLE IN THE CASE OF GOLDEN HORN IT WAS JOHN GODS
ONE THING YOU LEARN ABOUT BREEDING THERE ARE NO CERTAINTIES AND I WOULD SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO BREED THE ULTIMATE ANYTHING ELSE WILL PEDIGREE CATTLE HORSE THERE PLAYING GOD AND YOU VERY QUICKLY GET TOLD THAT NATURE'S THE BOSS HERE NOT YOU
AND SO YOU THINK I'M GONNA BE THE BEST OF THE BEST AND YOU CAN WIND UP THE WORST AND SOMETIMES YOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OFF BEAT THING AND IT WORKS YOU DON'T KNOW THE INDUSTRY IS CURRENTLY WRESTLING WITH ETHICAL ISSUES AS IT TRIES TO REMOVE THOSE UNCERTAINTIES THE CREATION OF A SUPER HORSE FLOUR FOR EXAMPLE SOME KIND OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING IS BANNED BY THE AUTHORITIES THERE'S ALSO A DEBATE ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION WITH CONCERNS THAT EQUINE DISEASE MIGHT MAKE IT OBLIGATORY
BUT FOR THE MEANTIME FOUR TIMES A DAY GOLDEN HORN MUST DO HIS WORK AND PRODUCE A COLD OR A FILLY TO WIN OVER A MILE AND A HALF AT THE EPSOM DERBY BULLARD BUT FIRST GOT THEM OVER
HE'S JUST GOT A GREAT CONSTITUTION THEN AND I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY BREED WHAT HE WAS HIMSELF A GOOD STRONG MIND GREAT AGILITY HE'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE FOOTBALLERS HE COULD MOVE ROUND THE FIELD AND NEXT THING WHERE DID HE GO HE'S GONE WITH THE BALL YOU NEVER SAW HIM DO IT HE HAS ALL OF THE ATTRIBUTES TO MAKE A GOOD STUDY
HE HAS SEVENTY FOUR MARES WHO ARE EITHER GROUP ONE WINNERS DAMS OF GROOVE ONE WINNERS OR IMMEDIATELY RELATED TO GROUP WINNERS SO HE HAS A GREAT CROSS SECTION ON THERE IS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T BE THE SOUND OF THE GARDEN

LOOK AT THE WEATHER CLOUD AND RAIN IN THE EAST SPREADING WEST YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST EIGHT LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS SOME CHARLES CARROLL DAVID CAMERON HAS CONCEDED THAT MIGRATION FROM THE E.U. POSES A CHALLENGE FOR THE U.K. BUT HE SAID THE ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED WITHOUT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
MEMBERS OF A TELEVISION AUDIENCE LAST NIGHT ACCUSED HIM OF SCAREMONGERING ABOUT A BRITISH EXIT ACCLAIM MISTER CAMERON REJECTED THE LEAF CAMPAIGN EARTHY NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY THERESA VILLAS TOLD US THE ONLY WAY FOR THE CONSERVATIVES TO HONOUR THEIR PLEDGE TO CURB NET MIGRATION WAS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE E.U.
M.P.S HAVE WARNED THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DEPORT CRIMINALS BACK TO OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES PEOPLE WILL QUESTION THE POINT OF REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS THOUSANDS OF RELEASED FOREIGN PRISONERS ARE ON THE STREETS OF BRITAIN THE HOME OFFICE SAYS THAT COMPARED WITH FIVE YEARS AGO THREE TIMES MORE EUROPEAN CRIMINALS ARE BEING REMOVED
A JAPANESE BOY HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE SIX DAYS AFTER HIS PARENTS PUNISHED HIM FOR MISBEHAVING BY TEMPORARILY ABANDONING HIM IN A FOREST YOU MATTER TO MUKER WAS DISCOVERED AT AN ARMY TRAINING BASE WHERE HE HAD TAKEN SHELTER AT THE WEEKEND AND FLOODWATERS ARE EXPECTED TO PEAK ON THE RIVER SEINE IN PARIS THIS MORNING THE LOO A FRIEND ALSO MUSEUMS HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO PROTECT ARTWORKS FLOODING ACROSS EUROPE HAS KILLED AT LEAST ELEVEN PEOPLE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHARLES IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT JUST IT IS IN CORNWALL FOR US TODAY FOR ONE OF A SERIES OF REPORTS ON THE ROAD AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM AWNING AND JUSTIN YES HELLO AGAIN THEY CAN WE'VE MOVED AGAIN ROUND TO RENDER ITS RAILWAY STATION NOW AND YOU CAN GO FROM THIS PRETTY LITTLE STATION WEST DEPENDS ANSWERING YOUR EAST DEVON TO LONDON FURTHER AFIELD THERE'S A TRAIN ABOUT TO LEAVE
GLASGOW IN A FEW MINUTES' TIME THAT'S GOING TO TAKE HER TIME BECAUSE OF COURSE THE TRAINS HERE ARE VERY SLOW AND THAT IS PART
OF WHAT MAKES CORNWALL FEELS SO SEPARATES THE SEPARATENESS THAT AFFECTS THE DEBATE ON THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAD A RANGE OF CORNISH VIEWS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO FINISH WITH LOVEDAY JENKIN WHO ITS FORMER LEADER OF MADDY AND KERN OVER PARTY FOR CORNWALL AND WITH BOB SMITH WHO WAS UKIP'S CANDIDATE FOR THE CAMBORNE AND RED RUTH CONSTITUENCY IN THE GENERAL ELECTION TWENTY FIFTY MORNING TO YOU BOTH
IF YOU ARE GOOD MORNING FIRST LOVEDAY THAT SEPARATENESS DAD HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF WHAT'S YOUR IDENTITY ARE YOU IN ANY WAY ENGLISH NO NO NO I HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO TASK ABOUT WHAT YOUR EARLIER ABOUT CORNWALL BEING A COUNTY OF ENGLAND CORNWALL IS MANAGED AS A COUNTY WITHIN ENGLAND BUT IT'S A DUCHY AND I'M CORNISH AND I'M BRITISH AND I'M EUROPEAN AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR VIEW OF YOU
I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN CORNWALL WOULD SAY THAT IF WE WEREN'T IN EUROPE WE WOULDN'T TRUST WESTMINSTER TO GIVE US MORE MONEY
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN SAID REPEATEDLY TO US DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME
BUT FOR WHAT REASON WHAT WAYNE IS IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU OR IS IT THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM IN WESTERNS I THINK IT'S PARTLY THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALISE THAT WE EXIST QUITE OFTEN A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALISE THE CORNISH LANGUAGE EXISTS AT THE REALISED THAT THE CORNISH R.
INDIGENOUS GROUP OF PEOPLE WITHIN WITHIN THE BRITISH ISLES BUT IT'S THAT LACK OF CONSIDERATION WE'VE SEEN ON THE MONEY COMING INTO H. S. TWO AND WE LOOK AT THE RAILWAY COMING INTO CORNWALL AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING LIKE THE SAME INVESTMENT
A BUZZ FROM IT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THAT WHEN
WESTMINSTER IS LEFT TO LOOK AFTER CORNWALL AS IT WAS IN THE PAST HE DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB WELL IF YOU DEVELOP POLITICAL SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY'S FORCED TO GO TO BRUSSELS
THAT'S WHAT YOU END UP WITH BUT IF YOU REMEMBER THE SEVENTY SIX SEVENTY NINE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A POLICY OF INTERMEDIATE AREAS AND DEVELOPMENT AREAS WE'D HAVE HAD THAT MONEY WE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE THE MONEY WE GIVE TO EUROPE IS PHIL STOP BY THE E.U. NOT EUROPE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND GIVEN BACK TO US WITH A STICKER SAYING THIS WAS SPONSORED BY THE E. R. D. F. AND EVERYBODY WALKS AROUND THINKING HOW GENEROUS THE EFFORTS DO YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE
WHEN YOU THINK OF THE OTHER COMPETING PARTS OF
ENGLAND NEVER MIND WELL JUST LOOK AT WESTMINSTER AND LOOK AT THAT THE OTHER COMPETING PARTS OF ENGLAND THAT WOULD BE LOOKING FOR FUNDING ARE LOOKING FOR FUN THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HELP ARE LOOKING FOR DEVELOP
THAT REALLY THE CORNWALL WOULD BE ABLE TO TO PUNCH ITS WEIGHT IN THAT FIGHT
WELL THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT M.P.S I ENTIRELY BELIEVE THAT IN A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THE CLOSE OF THE PEOPLE ART TO THOSE WHO GOVERN ON THE BETTER WE ARE
WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT APART FROM ALL THE REST WE WOULD HAVE THAT MONEY WE WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY AND IT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAMILY ON REPORT
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE CONVERGENCE FUNDING
WHICH IS A REPORT THAT SAYS WHAT THAT'S A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE COUNCIL TO LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY OF SPENDING OF THE CONVERGENCE FUNDS YES THERE IS A VIEW HERE ISN'T THAT A DAY THAT ACTUALLY ARE QUITE A LOT OF THE EUROPEAN MONEY HAS BEEN WASTED THERE ARE SOME PROJECTS THEY'RE A BIT TOURISTY PEOPLE SO I'M ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT REALLY DOING MUCH FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE IT IS THAT BUSINESS OF WHETHER OR NOT
YOUR MONEY IS WELL SPENT AND WHETHER OR NOT ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THERE WERE JUST CONTROL CLOSE AT HOME WELL I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THAT ARGUMENT IS THAT THE EUROPEAN MONEY WASN'T CONTROLLED CLOSER TO HOME THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WESTMINSTER GOVERNMENT AND SOUTH WEST REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES HAVE HAD THEIR FINGER IN THE PIE MANAGING THE EUROPEAN MONEY FOR CORNWALL
AND ACTUALLY IF THE PROGRAMME HAD BEEN MANAGED IN CORNWALL AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO MANAGE YOUR OWN MONEY COMING BACK FROM EUROPE WE WOULD DO VERY MUCH BETTER THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD EUROPEAN FUNDED PROJECTS THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE MONEY HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF AND THE BIGGEST THING IN THIS CURRENT PROGRAMME IS THAT ALL THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN DONE OUTSIDE OF CORNWALL AND THEREFORE THE TEN PER CENT ADMINISTRATION ET-CETERA ET-CETERA ALL THOSE ALL THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT OUTSIDE OF CORNWALL WRAPPING THEM IN CORNWALL WHICH NEED
IN THE END THOUGH IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY IS IT IT'S ABOUT A SENSE OF IDENTITY ISN'T IT BUZZES WITH HER THERE IS THIS SENSE OF WHETHER YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS BEING PRIMARILY
A PERSON WHO LOOKS TO WESTMINSTER OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THAT THAT EUROPEAN MIX I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT AND I'VE BEEN GO ROUND CORNWALL A LOT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
WHAT MOST PEOPLE TELL ME I WAS IN NEWQUAY YESTERDAY SPOKE TO NINETEEN PEOPLE FIFTEEN ARE GOING TO VOTE LEAVE TO VOTING AND TOUR UNDECIDED I THINK ALMOST GOING TO RETURN THE VOTE VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM UPPER I THINK OF CORNWALL RETURNS ABOUT LEAVE HER OUT IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF MISINFORMATION COMING TO THE PEOPLE OF COURSE
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CORNWALL WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUTSIDE OF EUROPE THERE ARE THINGS NEED TO BE CHANGED IN THE WAY THAT EUROPE IS MANAGED EUROPE NEEDS TO BE MORE DEMOCRATIC I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM BRUSSELS WHERE WE'VE BEEN HAVING A EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ENQUIRY ON LANGUAGE DISCRIMINATION AND PEEP ALL THE SMALL REGIONS ACROSS EUROPE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WITHIN EUROPE
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOICE OF THE REGIONS OF EUROPE IS IT RIGHT THAT DECISION NOT THAT FAR AWAY NOW THE PEOPLE OF CORNWALL ENERGISED BY IT ON BOTH SIDES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BOB SMITH TO LOVEDAY JACK IN THERE
THANKS VERY MUCH JUSTIN IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE ADVERTS EVERYWHERE FOR ME BEFORE YOU IN THE FILM VERSION OF JOE JIM ALWAYS BEST BESTSELLER WHICH OPENS IN CINEMAS TODAY PRODUCED BY METRO GOLDWYN MAYOR NEW LINE CINEMA IT'S THE STORY OF A YOUNG CARER WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE HANDSOME WEALTHY PARALYSED MAN THAT SHE'S LOOKING AFTER HERE'S A TASTE
DON'T SMILE AT ME LIKE THAT WHY NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS WHERE DID YOU PICK UP YOUR EXOTIC TASTES WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I CAN'T BE FROM ROUND HERE WHY NOT BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF PLACE PEOPLE COME TO AND HE GOT TIRED OF ACTUALLY LIVING
SHOULD BE OUT THERE CLAIMING THE WORLD IS EURO SHOWING A LEPRECHAUN CHOOSE THE DODGY MEN HIGH IN MY LIFE YOU LIKE EVERYTHING I'M HAPPY HERE WE SHOULDN'T BE SPACE
THE FACE OF MANCHESTER WHAT WE GOING TO STUDY FASHION SO WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
NO I SEE WHEN I MAKE IT YOU DON'T SAY POTENTIAL POTENTIAL
WELL IF YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE IT AND NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT THEN GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE GIVEN WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DISCUSS I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE END
AND THAT'S BECAUSE HE DECIDES TO GO TO DIGNITY US ON THAT HAS PROMPTED FURY PROTESTERS AT THE PREMIER CALLED IT A DISABILITY SNUFF MOVIE AND QUESTION NOT ONLY WHY DISABLED CHARACTERS AS IT SO OFTEN
SCUSE ME PORTRAYED IN A NEGATIVE WAY BUT ALSO WHY A DISABLED ACTOR COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THE LEAD ROLE THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE MORE PROTEST WHEN IT OPENS IN CINEMAS TODAY WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY PENNY PEPPER WHO IS A WRITER AND ACTIVIST WHO REVIEWED THE FILM FOR THE GUARDIAN AND FROM SCOTLAND BY MELANIE REID WHO WRITES FOR THE TIMES AND WAS PARALYSED IN A HORSE RIDING ACCIDENT SIX YEARS AGO GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING PENNY HELLO PENNY PEPPERS I'M SELLING YOUR PARTICULAR CRITICISM OF THE FILM WAS NOT SO MUCH THAT THERE WASN'T A
A NON DISABLED ACTOR PLAYING THE ROLE BUT THAT IT WAS THOUGH THE WAY HE PORTRAYED IT YOU SAID IN YOUR ARTICLE IT SUITS IT UNDERLINES THE VIEW YOU'RE BETTER OFF DEAD THAN A LIVING DISABLED BURDEN ON YOUR LOVED ONES
ABSOLUTELY AND I WOULD SAY OVER THE LAST WEEK TWO PARTICULARLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM MY VIEW PARTICULARLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM ACROSS THE WORLD DISABLED PEOPLE FEEL HUGELY
UNDER REPRESENTED AND INSULTED BY THIS FILM IN ONE WAY THE CRUCIAL WHITES BECAUSE THERE'S NO COUNTERBALANCE TO THIS IDEA THAT THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THE ISSUES OF YOUR IMPAIRMENT A TO DIE
SO IT'S LESS THAT IT'S THIS PARTICULAR STORY IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW STORIES OUT THERE PORTRAYING DISABLED PEOPLE YES THAT'S A KEY ISSUE BUT ALSO THAT THIS HAS ATTRACTED A LOT OF PUBLICITY ANY WHY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IN THERE
THE STARS AMELIA CLARK YOU KNOW AND START OF GAME OF THRONES AND SAM CATHERINE WHO IS PLAYING THE LEAD AND EVEN OFSTED THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH REALLY WITHIN THESE FILM THAT'S REALLY A RATHER FLABBY ROM COM BUT IT'S A
IT'S INSULTING TO US IN A CULTURE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE
POSITIVE ROLE MODELS FOR YOUNGER DISABLED PEOPLE WEREN'T ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HAD ON TWITTER THAT SPOON GENUINELY MOVING HIS ORGANISATIONS AND GROUPS AND AUTHORS WRITING ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION OF DISABLED LIVES FOR DISABLED CHILDREN
THERE'S THERE'S NO STRONG
ROUNDED REPRESENTATIONS OF DISABLED PEOPLE WHAT WE IN A ROM COM IS SOMEONE WHO DIES AND ALSO CHOOSES TO DIE IN A VERY
FLAWED REPRESENTATION OF DIGNITY TESS I MIGHT ADD RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT IT'S A LUXURY SWISS CHALET AND I MEAN I KNOW THE FILMS ON GENERAL RELEASE TODAY BUT IT SEASIDE BECAUSE BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT WILL THAT HERO IN QUOTES
IS VERY RICH AND I GET ALL THAT ABOUT IT BEING A FANTASY A BIT THE HEAT IN THE SET UP HE'S RICH AND HE LIVES IN A CASTLE SO WHEN HE CHOOSES TO GO TO DIGNITAS HE GOES IN STYLE WHEN I SEE HIM LET ME BRING IN MELANIE READ HER COS I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE BUT DOES IT SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF THING THAT WOULD WIND YOU UP
IT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL I MEAN I I'VE GOT I'VE GOT GREAT RESPECT FOR DISABILITY ACTORS BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE POSING REPOSING THEM IS THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY SOUND LIKE A BEASTLY OLD RIGHT WING OVER LIKES KILLING PEOPLE AND I'M NOT I JUST I JUST THINK THAT SOMETIMES A BAD FILMS ARE BAD FILM AND
THIS SOUNDS THAT I WOULDN'T GO AND SEE THIS FILM BECAUSE I READ THE REVIEWS AND IT SOUNDS AWFUL SMART SEE SLUSH AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM THAT IT DEPICTS THE QUADRIPLEGIC METICULOUS SIDE BUT I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WITH THE PULLING FILMS AND IT'S EIGHT YOU KNOW I I DO SOMETIMES THINK JUST DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE TO LIGHTEN UP AND WHEN I SPEAK AS SOMEONE WHO IN ORDER TO GO AND SEE THIS HERBERT WOULD TAKE HER BY HER DAYS PLANNING TO GET THERE
BUT I I OBJECT TO IT ON ON ARTISTIC GROUND SHALL WE SAY I'M NOT INSULTED BY REMOTELY WHY DID TO SAY THAT IF WE NEED TO LIGHTEN UP RATHER THAN PROTEST AGAINST IT I'M VERY LIGHT
THAT WAS BENNY SORRY MEAN YOU ARE TO THEM TO THE LIGHT
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS WE'RE NOT THERE'S NO THAT THE TROUBLE WITH ACTIVISTS AND ACTIVISM ABOUT DISABLED PEOPLE IS IT TENDS TO BE A GROUP SPEAK THERE TENDS TO BE A LACK OF NUANCE AND LACK OF INDIVIDUAL OUR INDIVIDUALITY AND I
THERE'LL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T INSULTED BY THIS MOVIE BY THAT BY THE VERY CONCEPT OF THE MOVIE THE PLOT BECAUSE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL DESPAIR ABOUT KIDS DO ABOUT BEING DISABLED WHO WHO WHO WHO KNOW THAT DYING ISN'T THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU AND I MEAN I'M IN THAT BOAT I KEEP GOING

I CAN BE DARK WITHIN MY LIGHTNESS SHALL WE SAY BUT THAT IS MY APPROACH AND I'VE BEEN A DISABLED PERSON I WASN'T BORN WITH MY IMPAIRMENT I'VE BEEN DISABLED SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN AND LIE FACE GROTTY I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MELANIE AND I WOULD ADD THAT THIS IDEA OF NUANCE
IS IT'S THERE IF WE ALLOW THE SPACE TO SPEAK THAT WEB YOU COS YOU HAVE TRIED TO WRITE STORIES PORTRAYING DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AT ALL MY WORKING LIFE AND WHAT HAPPENS WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION ONE OF THE ONES THAT SUCCEED AS OPPOSED TO THE ONES THAT DON'T
I'M SUCCEEDING MORE NOW THAT YOU KNOW IN MY FIFTIES FIFTEEN AND OLD YOU KNOW PUMP CART RAN T. OLD MOO NOW IF YOU LIKE ER BIG BECAUSE WE WORK SO HARD AS DISABLED PEOPLE TO CHANGE THINGS AND IT'S BEEN VERY SLOW

SUICIDE THAT MOST OF THE ACTIVELY SIGN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE IN A LITTLE BACK ROOM CAMDEN
IT'S MANY THOUSANDS ACROSS THE WORLD I WOULD ADD THAT WHEEDLING TO BILLY

SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THEY ARE JUST TOO LONG THAT'S THE COMPLAINT YOU OFTEN HEAR FROM PARENTS ABOUT THE SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING SCHOOL SUMMER HOLIDAY MANY EDUCATION EXPERTS AGREE THAT SO LONG AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE'S RESULTS SO BARNSLEY COUNCIL DECIDED TO EXPLORE WHERE TO CUT THE SUMMER BREAK FROM SIX WEEKS TO FIVE
AND TO GIVE CHILDREN AN EXTRA WEEK OFF LATER IN THE YEAR IT'S AN IDEA THOUGH THAT'S MET OPPOSITION FROM LOCAL HAD TEACHERS INCLUDING THE BOW IN THE PRINCIPLE OF HORIZON COLLEGE IN THE CITY THIS ISN'T ABOUT REDUCING HOLIDAYS IS THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOLIDAYS HITS JUST SHIFTING THEM AROUND SO THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIMES TO THE REST OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE THAT CAUSES A PROBLEM FOR YEAR ELEVENS
THEY'RE DOING THEIR EXAMS THEY'RE PREPARING FOR THE MARKS OCTOBER NOVEMBER IS A CRUCIAL TIME FOR THEM TO BE OFF FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS IS HIS MADNESS WERE LISTENING TO THAT JOIN IS ON THE LINE FROM BARNSLEY IS THE LEADER OF THE COUNCIL SIR STEVE HOUGHTON MORNING TO YOU SIR STEVE WHAT WAS THE THINKING WHY WERE YOU TEMPTED TO DO THIS OH I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY
THE BOOK BY WEEK STARTS TO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PUPILS LEARNING AND WE'VE ALSO GOT A LOT OF YOUR EVIDENCE FROM PARENTS GOING IT WILL BE GOOD
AT THE TIME YOU'RE EMPHASISING SOUNDS LIKE GETS THE REACTION IS PUTTING WELL VIC WE CAME BACK WE ARE PRINCIPLED DECISION AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE HEARD FROM MAKE UNDERS BEAGLE THE SECOND NOW STARTING TO FOLD ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT SECURE THIS WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO OH WHAT
WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF SHOTS ARE GREAT IN THE SUMMER WOULD BE THAT HEAD WAS NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IDEA OF A SHORTER SUMMER WAS WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS THE IDEA THAT YOU HAD ORIGINALLY GIVING AN EXTRA WEEK IN THE AUTUMN IN OCTOBER THAT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA COULD YOU KEEP THE IDEA FOR A SHORTER SUMMER HOLIDAY AND FIND ANOTHER TIME TO GIVE CHILDREN LONGER OFF CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT
BRING BANK HOLIDAY OR ALL THE TIMES IN THE YEAR SO WE'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSION AROUND ME BUT DO YOU THINK
EIGHT IN A WORD SETTEE DID YOU WOULD YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW I HOPE WE WILL HOLD OUR NERVE ER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SAY
HANG ON EVERYONE WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP OUT AND LEAD A BARNSLEY COUNCIL THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE YOUNG FISH WILL CHOOSE TO EAT PLASTIC IN THE SEA RATHER THAN NATURAL ALTERNATIVES JUST AS TEENAGERS CHOOSE FAST FOOD EVER HEALTHY OPTIONS THAT'S THE FINDING OF SWEDISH SCIENTIST WHO SAY THEIR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PLASTIC MIGHT CRIB RIPPED BEADS IN COSMETICS SHOULD BE BANNED WELL DOCTOR BRUNER LON STUDIES FROM UPPSALA UNIVERSITY IN SWEDEN SHE CARRIED OUT THEIR RESEARCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING WHAT WAS IT WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU FOUND THAT THESE YOUNG FISH WERE DOING
WELL WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE EXPOSED THESE ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS AND MICHAEL PLASTICS WAS THAT FIRST OF ALL IT AFFECTED HATCHING RATES AND THEN THE HATCH LARVAE THEY WERE SLOWER THEY WERE SMALLER AND THEY DID NOT RESPOND TO PREDATOR CUES SO THEY WERE EATEN MUCH FASTER THAN THE CONTROLS OH K. SAID'S OBVIOUSLY VERY BAD FOR THE FISH BUT THEY WOULD CHOOSE THEM EVEN WHEN THEY'RE THERE WAS ALONGSIDE THEM ARE MORE NATURAL BETTER SOURCE OF FOOD FOR THEM
YES THEY ALL HAD THEIR NATURAL FOOD SOURCE THEY HAD ACCESS TO IT TO SUPERINTENDENT AND THE LARVAE THE HAND MICHAEL PLASTICS THEY WOULD SNIFF THEM OUT AND THEY WERE JUST STUFFED THEMSELVES WITH THE PLASTICS WHICH IS WHY YOU SAY IT'S A BIT LIKE TEENAGERS BEING HOOKED ON FAST FOOD
WELL YES YOU COULD SAY THAT MAKE PLASTIC MOST MC PLASTIC OH KAY AND THE PLASTIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A PARTICULAR TYPE AS I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON WHICH ARE THESE MICRO BEADS
YES WE'RE LOOKING AT MICRO SO THEY'RE ABOUT NINETY MICHAEL METRES AND THAT IS A VERY TINY THEY ARE BARELY VISIBLE WITH THE HUMAN EYE NOW AM I RIGHT IN THINKING THAT THESE ARE THAT IN THINGS LIKE EXCESS FOLIATE AS THAT YOU COULD BUY IN ANY CHEMIST
YES THEY'RE IN THE EXFOLIATOR STIR AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF CUSTOMER EGGS SO THEY'RE VERY WIDELY USED IN MANY PROBLEM PRODUCT
THEY ARE VERY WIDELY USED IN PRODUCTS THEY'RE JUST WASHED OUT STRAIGHT INTO THE OCEANS AND YOU SAY THEY SHOULD BE BANNED
I THINK YES THIS CALLS FOR A BAN BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WHAT'S WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN WELL I'VE TESTED SEVERAL DIFFERENT FISH SPECIES NOW TO SEE THEIR RESPONSE AND ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME RESPONSE THERE EATING THESE BEARDS OF HER FOOD AND THEN THEY DIE AND IF THIS IS IF THIS HAPPENS ON A BROADER SCALE WE CAN HAVE SOME SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS
THE FISH POPULATIONS AND FOR THOSE COSMETIC COMPANIES WHO USE THEM IS THERE A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULDN'T CAUSE THIS PROBLEM
YES THERE ARE SEVERAL NATURAL ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY CAN USE AND THEY SHOULD USE SO OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN A CAMPAIGN RUNNING FOR THE BANNING OF THESE MICRO BEADS IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD SEE HAPPENING
I THINK SO ESPECIALLY NOW IN EUROPE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AMERICA'S ALREADY BANNED THEM IN NOW IN SOME COUNTRIES THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT TO ACTUALLY REMOVE THE PLASTICS FROM COSMETICS SO HOPEFULLY
THIS CAN HAPPEN THERE IS ALSO ONE IMAGINES THE OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING WHETHER IT'S TOOTHPASTE OR SHAMPOOZEL ANY FACE PRODUCTS TO CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T DOESN'T CONTAIN
OH YES JUST READ ON THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ON THE BACK AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND IF IT'S S. POLYETHYLENE A POLYSTYRENE OR ANYTHING THAT TRY TO BUY ANOTHER ANOTHER PRODUCT DOCTOR IN A NON STEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME NOW NINE MINUTES TONIGHT

BUT ALSO WE GO INTO QUITE A LOT ELECTRONICA SO SOMETHING MIGHT DANTE CAN R.E. FLEXED WING SO YEAH IT'S PRETTY UNUSUAL IT'S DIFFERENT PROJECTS AND IT'S JUST ONE OF THESE EVENTS WHICH I MEAN IT SEEMS ALMOST SURPRISING THAT WALES HASN'T HAD AN INTERNATIONAL VOICE FESTIVAL BEFORE IT SEEMS QUITE LIKE I CAN OBVIOUS THING TO DO BUT I'M VERY GLAD THAT IT HAS BEEN DONE EVENTUALLY I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL THING FOR THE CITY OF CARDIFF AND WALES IN GENERAL SO THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF MUSIC I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO SEE RUFUS WAYNE WAINWRIGHT'S CLAIM TOMORROW AND OBVIOUSLY
JOHN CALE IS PERFORMING THIS EVENING AND HE'S APPARENTLY DOING LOTS OF NEW ARRANGEMENTS OF VELVET UNDERGROUND SONGS EXCEPT AND ALSO I GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO SING WITH HIM WHICH I'M SUPER EXCITED
AND THE AIM IS THAT IT SHOULD THIS CARD THE IN CARDIFF THE GARDA VENTURED RIVAL SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST FESTIVAL ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT CADDIS BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOW ON THE UPTAKE OF TAKING ITS POSITION AS THE CULTURAL HELP THAT IT SHOULD BE AND WE'RE GETTING THERE NOW AND IT FEELS GOOD AND I WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE YOU HAVE THERE BEEN A VERY VOCAL FAN OF JEREMY CORBIN DO YOU THINK HE IS TREATED HAS BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY
YES I'D SAY SO I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA CURRENTLY THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT COMPLEX AND SEASONED NUANCES OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA CULTURE BIG BUT GO ON GIVE US AN IDEA GIVE US WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT UM I JUST THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SORT OF
THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON WITH WITH THE TORY ELECTION FRAUDS ALLEGATIONS AND HOW YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT VERY WIDELY KNOWN IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THAT IT'S JEREMY CORBIN HAS JUST BEEN COMPLETELY SLATED SO WENT FAIRLY A LOT OF THE TIME THEN I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY AN IMBALANCE THERE IN WHAT HOW DO YOU THINK HE'S BEEN SLATED WHAT IS IT THAT YOU SEE THAT YOU THINK HOLD ON A SECOND THIS IS NOT THEM I MEAN I PRESUME YOU KNOW HIM
I'VE I'VE MET HIM ONLY ONCE ABOUT A YEAR AGO AT ONE OF THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY MATCHES BUT I MEAN JUST EVERYTHING THE MAJORITY OF THE STUFF THAT I SEE ABOUT JEREMY CORBIN I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT REFLECTS THE POPULAR IDEA OF WHO HE IS AND WHAT THE PEOPLE THINK YEAH IT JUST IT JUST FEELS IT COMES ACROSS AS A LITTLE
BUYERS DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD PUT HIMSELF OUT MORE FOR INTERVIEWS BECAUSE HE HE'S OFTEN ASKED TO DO INTERVIEWS HE DOESN'T DO THEM DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD PUT HIMSELF AND ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE INTERVIEWED MORE I DON'T KNOW A EACH TO THEIR OWN I DON'T WANT TO DO FOR THE BEST I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A POLITICIAN OR WHORE HOW YOU YOU MANAGE PRESS IT IN THAT SITUATION
YEAH MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE ANSWER CHARLOTTE CHURCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU HE KNOWS OUR NUMBER DO YOU CALL FIVE TO NINE NOW THE OLD VOTE THE YOUNG DOMES THAT SIMPLE TRUTH COULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE RESULT OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN FACT MANY YOUNGER VOTERS I WANT EVEN REGISTERED TO VOTE MORE FOOL THEM IT'S THE REACTION OF MANY WHO ARE
ARE THERE SOME EVIDENCE TODAY THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REGISTER WHO WANT OF HER BEING PUT OFF BY THE PROCESS INVOLVED WHICH JOINED BY EDITH WHITEHEAD FROM BITE THE BALLOT WHICH WORKS TO IMPROVE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S NOT VERY DIFFICULT AS YOU WHAT WHAT IF YOU FOUND WHAT'S THE PROB
I FOUND HIS REGISTRATION WILL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A GAP AND POLITICAL EDUCATION WHICH MEANS THAT AS HE MOVES FROM HOUSEHOLD TO INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE FAMILIES ARE POLITICAL IF THE COMMUNITIES A POLITICAL THEY WOULDN'T REGISTER AND THAT'S WHY WE TRY AND DO A LOT OF SESSIONS AND SCORES THE TRY AND BRING ABOUT THAT ELEMENT OF REGISTERING AS A KEY PART OF THE PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO REGISTRATION ITSELF THE MOVEMENT A MAN HAS BEEN FANTASTIC WHEN WE DID THE NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVING TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I THINK YOU'RE REGISTERED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND IN A DAY
OF ACTIVITY WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT WHEN HE MOVED ON LINE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MERGED IT ALWAYS HALF A MILLION IN THE WEEK BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S CATER WELL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO NEED REGISTRATION TO BE EASY QUICK AND ACCESSIBLE BUT WHAT WHERE WE WORKING NOW IS WITH PEOPLE WHO REGISTRATION ISN'T SOMETHING WHERE THEY FEEL EMPOWERED TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S A DUTY AND YOU'VE GOT SOME INTERESTING FIGURES HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE HAVE COME TO YOUR WEBSITE FIRST OF ALL ABOUT ABOUT ONE YOU DIRECT THEM TO THE OFFICIAL VOTER REGISTRATION WEBSITE YEP AND IF THEY DON'T END UP REGISTRY
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT FIGURES I SET MYSELF BUT WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE CLICK THROUGH AND I TRACKED LINKS BUT THEY GETS GNASHER INSURANCE PAGE AND THEY DON'T CARRY ON AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF THEM TO SAY THAT THEY COME BACK AND DO IT AGAIN BUT THE PACIFIC FIGURES I HAVE IS THAT THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE CLICK FROM YOUR WEBSITE TO THE VOTER REGISTRATION PAGE AND JUST TEN I ASSESS FULLY REGISTERED AT THAT STAGE YEAH YOU YOU THINK THE REASON YOU'VE JUST SAID I THINK IS THAT THAT THIS NEED TO GIVE YOUR NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER
HE'S A BARRIER FOR B. YEAH I MEAN LET ME TAKE YOU ON A JOURNEY THROUGH THE NATURAL SHIRTS PAGE HE SAYS GIVEN A TREASURES NUMBER IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU CAN SAY WHERE CAN I FIND IT SEE IF I COULD HAVE A PAGER COMES UP WITH FORMS YOU CAN FILLING TO FIND THEIR WAY TO FIND OUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING WITH WON'T HAVE BE SIXTIES THEY WON'T KNOW WHERE THERE IS PAYSLIP IS OR YOU CAN WRITE A MESSAGE AS TO WHY YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU NEED TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO PROVE HER IDENTITY
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE A BIT SCEPTICAL ABOUT INSTITUTIONS BIT SCEPTICAL ABOUT ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENT LOCAL COUNCIL IN GENERAL WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE POLITICS ABOUT THEM BUT WHEN THEY COME UP TO FACE ANOTHER TOUCH POINT YOU FIND THE MORE TOUCH ONCE THEY HAVE THEIR FACE WITH DIFFERENT KIND OF INSTITUTIONS AND ON THE PATH TO GET REGISTERED MEANS THAT THEY WEREN'T COMPLETE IT SO JUST BE CLEAR THE SITE WORKS YOU ENCOURAGED TO USE UP SHE'S LOOKING AT THE FIGURES HERE THEY WERE SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO REGISTERED ON YESTERDAY ALONE HE'S A VERY VERY HIGH NUMBERS
BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S OFF PUTTING TO PEOPLE YET TO SOME PEOPLE YES IT IS IS A FANTASTIC SYSTEM BUT IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FIGHT IN ME USED TO BE COUPLE WITH POLITICAL EDUCATION NOW WHO ISN'T ACTUALLY MANDATORY BUT IT'S JUST VERY VERY CONVENIENT ESPECIALLY WHEN AHEAD OF AN E.U. REFERENDUM YOU'RE PROCESSING HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF REGISTRATIONS NEVERTHELESS IS IT THE CASE THAT YOU WOULD SAY TO PEOPLE GET THROUGH THAT HURDLE LADIES DOABLE IT WON'T TAKE YOU THAT LONG BUT THE THING IS WITH A STARTS THEY SHOW THAT WE CAN TAKE PEOPLE UP TO THE POINT WHEN THEY GET TO THE GOVERNMENT PORTAL BUT WE CAN'T HOLD HER HAND FROM
YEAH AND AND OH YOU WORRIED THAT WE WILL END UP WITH MANY FEWER YOUNG PEOPLE REGISTERED AND THEN COULD
FEWER THAN COULD YES BUT FEWER OF THEM WOULD HAVE REGISTERED IF WE HADN'T BEEN DOING A CAMPAIGN THAT WE'RE DOING THIS WEEK NO WE'RE WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH HOPE I HATE TO DO A WEEK LONG NATIONAL THEIR TREASURY DRIVE BOTH ON AND OFF LINE WHICH I HOPEFULLY GET THOSE PEOPLE BACK ON PUT
