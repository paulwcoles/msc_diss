LATER ON THIS MORNING SO THINGS BECOMING DRIER THERE'LL BE A PERIOD OF SOME HAZY SUNSHINE BUT THEN LATER THIS AFTERNOON MORE HEAVY RAIN AND MORE THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING INTO THE SAME REGION SO THERE COULD BE FURTHER FLOODING PROBLEMS THE RUSH HOUR AT THIS EVENING TEMPERATURES THOUGH QUITE A MUGGY TWENTY THREE DEGREES

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE POOR LITTLE EARLY BUTLER SIX YEARS OLD WAS SENT BY A COURT TO LIVE WITH HER FATHER WHO THEN MURDERED HER BUT ALL OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE EXAMINED BY A PUBLIC ENQUIRY PROCESS IN THE GUARDIAN ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY IT'S SYMPATHETIC
TO EARLY BUTLER'S GRANDFATHER IS SAYING THIS MORNING THAT THE A SOUND CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS INTENDED TO PROTECT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THAT PREVENT JUDGES FROM APPEARING BEFORE EXTERNAL AGENCIES IF THEIR DECISION IS TO BE CHALLENGED THE GUARDIAN SAYS IT'S BY APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT AN INQUIRY THAT TRIED TO TAKE EVIDENCE FROM A JUDGE
AS ELLIE'S GRANDFATHER WANTS WOOD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN TO THREATEN JUDGE'S INDEPENDENCE
INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE IN THE TIMES THIS MORNING INCLUDES A REPORT FROM PRETORIA ON SOUTH AFRICA'S WORST RIOTING SINCE THE END OF A PARTY IT SAYS MOBS LOOTED SHOPS BURNT VEHICLES AND BLOCKED ROADS WITH RUBBLE AND BURNING TYRES AS WRITING SPREAD THROUGH TOWNSHIP SURROUNDING THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL AT THE CAUSE BEING THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW MAYOR BUT IT'S FEARED THAT THE VIOLENCE COULD SPREAD TO JOHANNESBURG ECONOMIC PRESSURE AND A LACK OF SERVICES FOR THE POOR HAVE CAUSED
GROWING LEVELS OF UNREST SAYS THE TIME SINCE TWENTY TEN BUT DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE WRITING IS IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE RUNNING INTO MILLIONS OF POUNDS WITH AT LEAST TWENTY ONE BUSES AND HALF A DOZEN LORRY SET ON FIRE THERE IS THE STRONGEST ENDORSEMENT YET FOR THE SO CALLED HEATHROW HUB PLAN WHICH AIMS TO CREATE A LENGTHENED RUNWAY AT HEATHROW AIRPORT INSTEAD OF ANOTHER RUNWAY IF YOU LENGTHEN AND
IT'S QUITE A BIG LENGTHENING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PLANS THAT WAS PUT BEFORE THE AIRPORT'S COMMISSION THAT LOOKED INTO OR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING MORE
CAPACITY IN AIRPORTS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF LENGTH AND FOUR POINT TWO MILE RUNWAY FOR ABOUT TWO THIRDS WOULD COME IN AT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE PRICE OF CREATING A NEW RUNWAY THIS ACCORDING TO
WILL YOU WASH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BRITISH AIRWAYS PARENT COMPANY WHO HAS CALLED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN RATHER THAN THE THIRD RUNWAY AND MEANS ACCUSED HEATHROW RIPPING OFF PASSENGERS WITH PLANS FOR THAT ME WRONG AND A UNILEVER WHICH OWNS FOUR HUNDRED BRANDS EVERYTHING FROM SOME SILK SHAMPOO TO NOR STOCK CUBES HAS DECIDED THAT IT'S GOING TO DROP ALL SEXES STEREOTYPES FROM ITS ADVERTISING IT'S THE WORLD'S SECOND BIGGEST ADVERTISE AND SPEND SOMETHING LIKE SIX BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
ON ITS ADVERTISEMENTS BUT ITS OWN RESEARCH FOUND THAT WOMEN WERE RARELY PRESENTED AS HAVING A THOROUGH TEA ONLY THREE PER CENT OF ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURED WOMEN IN MANAGERIAL LEADERSHIP OR PROFESSIONAL ROLES IT'S DECIDED TO CHANGE THAT AT LEAST AS FAR AS ITS OWN ADVERTISING IS CONCERNED AND WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT DECISION AFTER HOPPER STATE TIME NOW ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX THERE'S TO BE AN ENQUIRY INTO AN ALLEGATION OF A GRUESOME CRUEL PRACTICE AT ONE HUNT TOM SIMON'S HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT WHAT'S THE ALLEGATION TOM
WELL THIS IS THIS SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE HUNT AND THE ALLEGATION IS THAT SOME HIDDEN CAMERAS PLACED BY ANTI HUNT CAMPAIGNERS SHOWED A MAN KEEPING LIVE YOUNG FOXES IN A CAGE IN THE YARD OF THE SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE PLANTS AND THEN AT A LATER STAGE A LATER DATE
TAKING TWO OF THOSE FOXES INTO THE KENNELS OF THE HUNT THE SOUNDTRACK OF THESE CAMERAS THEN SHOW OR THEN SHOW SOME SOME SOME BARKING AND SOME NOISES FROM INSIDE THE KENNEL AND THEN THE BODIES OF TWO FOXES ARE BROUGHT OUT AND PLACED IN A BIN THE CAMPAIGNERS BROKE INTO THE WHO GOT INTO THE YARDS OF THAT HUNT AND TOOK THE BODY GIVEN THEM TO THE POLICE ALONG WITH THE FOOTAGE
AND THE ALLEGATION IS THAT THE HOUNDS IN THE KENNELS WERE BEING TRAINED TO HUNT TO KILL FOXES SOMETHING WHICH THE CAMPAIGNERS SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY DO NATURALLY A POLICE INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR PAID MEMBER OF THE HUNT STAFF HAS BEEN SUSPENDED AND AS YOU SAY
THE MASTERS OF FOXHOUNDS ASSOCIATION HAS ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION TO BE LED BY A FORMER APPEAL COURT JUDGE IN THE ALLEGATION IS THAT THIS IS QUITE A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE
THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT THESE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE HUNTER INVESTIGATION TEAM AND THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS BOTH SAY THAT FOXES DO NOT THAT HOUNDS DO NOT NATURALLY HUNT FOXES AND THAT THIS IS DONE TO REALLY KEEP THEM INTERESTED
IN HUNTING THERE'S LESS CHANCE FOR HOUNDS TO COME ACROSS FOXES BECAUSE THE HUNTING BAN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HAS MADE IT ILLEGAL THEY SAY THAT HUNTING STILL GOES ON THAT THAT HAPPEN SOMETIMES BY ACCIDENTS WHICH KEEPS THEM WITHIN THE LAW HUNTS AND THEY SAY IT'S A BIG CONCERN AND THE DISEASE AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHICH IS YOU SAY HE'S GOING GOING ON ACROSS THE THE INDUSTRY MUNT
THANKS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX LIBYAN FORCES HAVE SUFFERED ONE OF THEIR WORST LOSSES IN A MONTH LONG CAMPAIGN AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT QUENTIN SOMERVILLE JOINS US FROM MISS RATA CLOSE TO THE FRONT LINE AND QUENTIN YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION
THAT'S RIGHT MICHELLE THE LIBYAN FORCES MERELY MILITIA FROM THE HEART OF THE ISLAMIC THE PEN DOWN AND CUT OFF THE FACT WE MADE ALL THE WAY TO THE ISLAMIC STATE SUPPORT IT SUPPORT REALLY THERE OVER THE HORIZON FAECES FAECES EUROPE IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH OVEN YOU POP YOUR HEAD OVER THE SAND DUNES THERE
AND YOU CAN AVOID TO NAPLES YOU CAN SEE VESSEL SITTING ON ON THE KEY THINK ISIS CAN ONLY GET THE SMALL SPORTS INTO THE WATER AND THE MAN CHARGED WITH KEEPING ICES FROM ESCAPING TO THE SEA IS HUMS A OF BRIGADE ONE SIX SIX
OVER THIS MOON MARK I CANNOT THERE BUT IT WAS FASTER THAN WE EXPECTED THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT FACED US WHILE SAW SIDE GOT BOMBS BUT WE WERE ABLE TO CAN'T HAVE HIM BY BLOCKING THE RFDS FIRING ON THEN WITH HIPPY WERE BONES FROM A DISTANCE BEFORE THEY ARE BROUGHT US IT TOOK US LESS THAN FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE RAMADAN WOODY AREN'T SCARED SUBSET WE HAVE THEN MANAGED TO THICK BASES AND TRAINING CAMPS THOSE WERE ALL CONTROLLED BY THE DUBBLE BUBBLE
SO MICHELLE THEY FACED SOME FIERCE FIGHTING EARLIER THIS WEEK THEY MANAGED TO GET FOR THE KILOMETRE INSIDE THE CITY BUT THEY WERE HEAVY LOSSES IT WAS IN FACT THE BLOODIEST FOR THESE LIBYAN FORCES FIGHTING ISLAMIC STATE ONE FIFTY MEN KILLED THESE ARE TINY FORCES IMPROVISE FORCES WE MADE OUR WAY TO A FIELD HOSPITAL WHERE I MET MY MUDDYING HE EXPLAINED TO ME WHY THIS FIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL
THEY BE HERE DID I WHAT ARE CHILDREN THEY CRUCIFIED THEM AND THROW THEM OFF THE BUILDINGS THEY TERRORISED PEOPLE DO AND AVENUES DID HAVE FAITH TO JUSTIFY THEIR CRIMES
ISLAM HAS NO ROOM FOR THEM HE I'LL SAY DOES ITS BIT OMITTED TOOK IT WITH HIM AND SHOW THEM NO ONE THERE SO YOU'VE GOT A HAMMER
QUINTON I HOPE I HOPE YOU'RE STILL WITH US YOU SAID EARLIER THAT THAT THESE FORCES HAD I. S. PINNED DOWN OR DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE END OF THIS OPERATION IS IN SIGHT
IT'S GOING TO BE SOME VERY TOUGH FIGHTING AHEAD THE MOVING RIGHT INTO THE DEEPEST PART OF THE CITY IT'S VERY BUILT UP THERE IT'S AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT SO IT WILL TAKE PROBABLY WEEKS AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE CASUALTIES BUT IS YOU'VE GOT THE SCENES PERHAPS FROM THOSE TWO FATAL
THEY FEEL THE COUNTRY ISN'T JUST ECSTATIC BUT BUT ISLAM WAS AT STAKE AND WE WERE WITH THEM DURING THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN WE HAD IF IT WITH THEM AS THEY BROKE THE FAST AND THEY WILL BE PRAYED IN THE CRIED OUT ALLAHU AKBAR THE PRAISED GOD IT AND THEY MADE THE POINT THAT ALLOW WHITE BAR BELONGS TO THEM IT DOESN'T BELONG TO SWISHED SUICIDE BOMB
QUENTIN SOMERVILLE IN MISTER OUT IN LIBYA THANK YOU SIXTY MINUTES PAST SIX WILL THINK THAT ENERGY BILLS ARE TOO HIGH IT TOMORROW I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE ARE RIGHT WE'LL GET THE RESULTS OF A TWO YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO THE ENERGY MARKET AND THE DOMINANT HIS HAIR WITH A PREVIEW OF THAT ONE DOMINIC THANKS JUSTIN IS THE COMPETITION OR MARKETS THOROUGHLY HAS BEEN EXAMINING WHETHER THE MARKET WORKS PROPERLY AND WITH HER WE'RE ALL BEING RIPPED OFF BY THE SO CALLED BIG SIX POWER SUPPLIERS WHO TOGETHER HOLD EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE MARKET
INVESTIGATION WAS LAUNCHED NOT LONG AFTER IT MILLER BEN MADE HIS CALL FOR AN ENERGY PRICE FREEZE BECKON TWENTY THIRTEEN WE GET THE FULL DETAILS TOMORROW BUT THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT WOULD BE A BIT OF A DAMP SQUIB THE BIG SIX WON'T BE BROKEN UP AND WOULD LIKE IT TO BE LIP FOR SOME FIDDLING AROUND THE EDGES TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SWITCH SUPPLIERS
WITH ME NOW AS STEVE SMITH AFFORD THE FORMER BOARD MEMBER OF JIM NOW DIRECTOR OF COMPETITION AND BIGOTRY STRATEGY FOR LLOYDS BANK AND A NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR EPPING ENERGY SWITCHING WEBSITE FLIPPER STEVE THIS INQUIRY START OF THE REAL HISS SIN RAW DIDN'T I'M GOING TO BREAK UP THE BIG SIX AND POWER PRICES ARE GOING TO FALL DRAMATICALLY BUT LOOKS LIKE BEING A BIT LIMP HOW IF WE ARRIVED AT THIS POINT
I THINK BASICALLY BECAUSE THE MARKET'S IN RUDE HEALTH SO YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW TWENTY PLUS SUPPLIERS KICKING AT THE HEELS OF THE BIG SIX THEY'VE GRAB FIFTEEN PERCENT MARKET SHARE SO THERE THE SIX LARGEST SUPPLIES MIGHT HAVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT TODAY A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND THEY'RE STILL LOSING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE CEUM AIR FOUND THAT SOMETHING THEY CAN STRUCTURAL NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF SUPPLIES COMPETING HARD OFFERING MUCH BETTER PRICES
THAN THE LARGE SUPPLIES ARE MUCH BETTER QUALITY OF SERVICE AS WELL SO MARK AT SOME RUDE HEALTH THERE SOME CHOIR HAS COST ROUND ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION QUID HAS JUST BEEN A COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME WHERE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY HAVE FOUND IS ACTUALLY THE ENERGY REGULATOR ITSELF OR DONE SOME SILLY THINGS THAT PUSH PRICES UP AND COST CUSTOMERS A LOT OF MONEY SO I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THEY'VE DONE IS HE'S UNWOUND THEM AND GIVEN ALL OF THE SUPPLIES FREEDOM TO COMPETE PROPERLY AND NOT RESTRICTED HOW MANY PRODUCTS THEY CAN HAVE OR HOW THEY CHARGE SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE
BIG WINDS FROM THE ENQUIRIES ACTUALLY SWEEPING SOME OF THAT AWAY I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GET OFF GEM'S RULES REPLACED BY SIMPSON MORE SILLY RULES BY THIS BY THE C.M.A. SO IDEAS LIKE THIS CUSTOMER DATABASE I DON'T THING MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS WANT TO BE BOMBARDED WITH SPAM AND JUNK MAIL TELLING THEM TO SWITCH ENERGY SUPPLIER WE'VE GOT THIS TO THE SIDE THIS IDEA WAS THAT IF YOU'RE A BIG SIX SUPPLY YOU HEAD TO MAKE YOU HAD TO GIVE YOUR RIVALS ALL THE DETAILS OF YOUR CUSTOMERS SO THAT THEY COULD GO AND PITCH TO THEM IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF A
STRANGE IDEA TO ME IT DOESN'T I THINK WHICH THE CONSUMER GROUP HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS THE SPAMMERS CHARTER I THINK IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH THOSE CUSTOMERS OFF FOREVER THEN THEN THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD WAY TO GO SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA AND LET'S HOPE THEY DROP THAT TOMORROW THE OTHER THING IS THIS THIS PRICE CUT FOR CUSTOMERS OR USE PRE PAYMENT WHICH AGAIN
YOU KNOW LOTS OF POLITICANS CONCERN ABOUT THAT GROUP AND IN THE PRE PAYMENT MARKET AGAIN HE GOT A COUPLE OF SUPPLIES USING NEW TECHNOLOGY LOWER PRICES THEY'VE GRABBED ABOUT TEN PERCENT MARKET SHARE IN THE MATCH YOU'RE SAYING THE SUMOS PRICE CAP PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH SEEMS RATHER STRESSED HERE FOR SAFETY WANTS A VERY WE'RE ENDING UP WITH SOME THINGS AROUND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR AND THEN SOME OTHER ODD IDEAS ALL SEEMS TO ME THAT ACTUALLY IT DIDN'T WARRANT TO SEE HIM INVESTIGATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
I THINK I THINK YOU'RE ONE OF THINGS TO SEE AND I CAN DO AND CAN DO WELL HE'S ACTUALLY NEUTRALISE THE POLITICS OF ENERGY HAS BEEN A POLITICAL HOT POTATO FOR MANY MANY YEARS SO I THINK
HELPFULLY WHAT THEY COULD DO ON FRIDAY IS ACTUALLY TO SAY TO THE POLITICIANS THIS IS WHAT WORKS THIS IS WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND ACTUALLY IT'S TIME TO LEAVE THINGS ALONE WOULD WE HAVE HAD THE SAME CHOIR IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR ED MILIBAND MAKING LIFE VERY HARD FOR THE COALITION BECKON TWENTY THIRTEEN IT WAS A VERY EYE CATCHING IDEA WAS FOR A PRICE FREEZE I MEAN OF JIM HAD BEEN MEDDLING IN THIS MARKET FOR FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS LONG BEFORE THE C.M.A. CAME IN I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY DAVID CAMERON WHO CALLED FOR INITIALLY SO I THINK THERE DEFINITELY WAS
A POLITICAL ANGLE TO THIS AS YOU SAY BECAUSE I WAS JUST SO MUCH POLITICAL CONCERN ABOUT ENERGY PRICES AND THE SEA OR MAY HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE AND PETROL RETAILING AND OTHER THINGS WHEN THE POLITICIANS DECIDE SOMETHING'S TOO HOT TO HANDLE IT'S THE ORGANISATION THAT HAS A LOOK AND IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S THE TRUTH HERE JUST QUICKLY SHOULD WE WOULD BE A BIT MORE WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON THE BIG PROM AND ENERGY IS WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH OF LOOKING FORWARD
WELL I THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH EVERYONE FOCUSING ON RETAIL IS THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE BIGGER ISSUES IN ENERGY ARE BEING SOLD THANK YOU VERY MUCH STEVE SMITH TURNED TO THE MARKETS NOW I'M JOINED BY KATE ACED ONYX FUND MANAGER T. H. S. PARTNERS
ONE OF THE BIG EVENTS THIS MORNING IS GOING TO BE RESULTS FROM TESCO PROBABLY FAIRLY UNEVENTFUL RESULTS FLAT SALES BUT THERE ARE SOME BIG THINGS GOING ON ON THE GROCERY MARKETS AREN'T THEIR TESCO HAS TO FACE UP TO THESE DISCOUNTERS AND TACKLE THEM HEAD ON YEAH THE DISCOUNTERS HAVE MANAGED TO GET INTO THE U.K. MARKET BECAUSE THE MARGINS HERE WERE VERY HIGH
THE GROSS MUGS WERE HIGH AND THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUSE ACCESS TO RETAIL SITES WAS CONTROLLED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS AND SO WHERE THEY WERE THEN ABLE TO COME IN AND OFFER MUCH BETTER PRICES AND OF COURSE THEY'RE NOW FACED ALSO BY THIS TREND TOWARDS ONLINE SHOPPING WHERE YOU'VE GOT COMPANIES LIKE OCADO AND NOW AMAZON COMING ALONG TO COMPETE AND THAT INCREASES THE COSTS FOR RETAILERS AND
PROBABLY FOR THE LONG TERM AS IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF RETAILING DEPRESSES PROFITS FOR THAT GENERALLY WHAT SHOULD LOUIS BE DOING DO YOU THINK SHOULD HE GO HARDER THE DISCOUNTERS AND TRY AND MATCH THEM ON PRICE
OR DOES HE HE HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT ROAD TO STEER DOESN'T HE BECAUSE HE HAS A VERY VALUABLE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO POTIPHAR TAKE AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT HE WILL HAVE TO MATCH THE DISCOUNTERS ON PRICE AND THEN HE WILL HAVE TO DO TRY AND DO BETTER ON SERVICE IN THAT THESE DAYS INVOLVES HAVING A VERY GOOD ONLINE OFFERING AND KEEPING THAT AT A REASONABLE COST BUT I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE FOR A LOT OF RETAILING
IS THAT THE SHIFT TO ONLINE SHOPPING IN THE U.K. IS ONE OF THE LEADING THE USERS OF ONLINE SHOPPING MEANS THAT MARGINS HAVE PROBABLY SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FOR EVERYONE FOR FOR SOME TIME TO COME AND THAT MEANS SHAREHOLDERS AND THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT THE GOOD DAYS ARE GONE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT BACK AS MUCH MONEY FROM TESCO SAINSBURY'S AS THEY USED TO NO I THINK IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD IN THE REST OF EUROPE OR IN THE U.S. THE MARGINS FOR FOOD RETAILERS
WERE ALWAYS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN HERE IN THE U.K. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PICTURE GOING FORWARD THERE NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE CAN'T INNOVATE AND GIVE A GOOD SERVICE AND COME UP WITH GOOD PRODUCTS AND THE TREND TOWARDS HEALTHY LIVING AND ALL OF THOSE SORT OF THINGS IF THE RETAILER DOES THE RIGHT THING THEN AS WE'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE WITH THE LIKES OF WAITROSE AND PEOPLE CHOOSING MOVE LOCAL OATS SUPERMARKETS AND SO ON
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND BUT THE TRADITIONAL MODEL ON THE TRADITIONAL HIGH PROFITS AND PROBABLY GONE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE AT THE OIL MARKET NOW THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABERDEEN YESTERDAY SUB SEA SEVEN WHICH IS ONE OF THE BIG PROVIDERS OF SERVICES TO THE OFFSHORE INDUSTRY IS LAYING OFF A LOT OF STAFF
WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THE SUN WE HAVE ABERDEEN ON THE NORTH SEA IS HE WILL BE EXPOSED TO FALLING PRICES THIS SUB SEA SEVEN SEVEN IS THAT SORT OF THE PLUMBER FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY AND AS WITH THE NEAR HALVING IN THE PRICE OF OIL OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO THE SPENDING BY THE BIG OIL COMPANIES ON THE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION HAS GONE FROM SOME SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY TO INTO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS
AND THAT WILL HAVE SOME FAIRLY SEVERE IMP I HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON THEIR SUPPLIERS BUT THAT WILL EVENTUALLY DO FOR THE PRICE OF ALL WE SHALL SEE IF THAT THAT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IS REDUCED WE'LL PROBABLY OIL WILL BE CAN BECOME MORE SCARCE AGAIN BUT FOR THE TIME BEING IT'S A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR THE PEOPLE OF BETWEEN TOUGH TIMES AHEAD FOR THE NORTH'S IN ABERDEEN IN PARTICULAR THANK YOU MUCH OF A CATALYST ONYX FUN MINIATURE FUND MANAGER EXCUSE ME A TEAR CHESS PARTNERS
FOR MANY DISABLED PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM A MILITARY BACKGROUND FINDING A JOB ONCE BACK IN CIVILIAN LIFE CAN BE HARD WORK BUT THERE'S HELP AT HAND IN THE SHAPE OF ROYAL BRITISH LEGION INDUSTRIES WHICH NOT ONLY RUNS RETRAINING SCHEMES BUT ALSO HAS ITS OWN FACTORIES WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS MAKE ROAD AND RAIL SCIENCE IT WAS SET UP WAY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETEEN TO HELP FIRST WORLD WAR VETERANS AND NOW AFTER A BIG RESTRUCTURING IT'S FINDING A NEW ROLE HELPING THE WIDER DISABLED COMMUNITY I PAID A VISIT TO ITS HEADQUARTERS

YES I THINK IT WAS I THINK IT WAS A GOOD CASE OF PLENTY OF HEART AND PLENTY OF PASSION AND LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE
BUT IN MY OPINION LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE HE'S ALLOWING THEM TO
AND YOU DESCRIBE IT AS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE BUT IT'S A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT SHOULD MAKE A PROFIT
IT'S A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE WHICH ONE NOW THIS YEAR I THINK FOR THE FIRST YEAR MAKE MODESTO
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE CONFIDENT AND OUR SELF ESTEEM WE SHOULD WIN I'M PART OF THAT IS MADE FROM A SURPLUS DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT WAYS OF MEASURING DIFFERENTIAL
OR SOCIAL GOOD THAT IS DONE BY ENTERPRISES LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND A FIGURE FOR THIS IN THE NATIONAL ACCOUNTS BUT IT'S HUGELY VALUABLE

PRISON REFORM TRUST SAYS INMATES IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHO ARE SERVING INDEFINITE SENTENCES HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SELF HARM IN JAIL THE TRUST SAYS THE LACK OF A RELEASE DATE HAS LED TO GROWING DESPERATION AMONG THE PRISONERS WERE MAINLY SERVING SENTENCES FOR SERIOUS VIOLENT OR SEXUAL OFFENCES
AT THE YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IN FRANCE WALES HAVE BEEN PAIRED WITH NORTHERN IRELAND IN A MATCH TO SEE WHO REACHES THE QUARTER FINALS ENGLAND WILL PLAY ICELAND IN THE LAST SIXTEEN WHILE A LATE GOAL BY THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AGAINST ITALY LAST NIGHT MEANS THEY ALSO QUALIFIED FOR THE KNOCK OUT STAGES WHERE THEY WILL PLAY THE HOSTS FRANCE

THANK YOU TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AS WE WERE HEARING THEIR PRISONERS SERVING SENTENCES WITHOUT CLEAR RELEASE STATES ARE BEING DRIVEN TO DESPAIR LEADING TO DRAMATIC LEVELS OF SELF HARM THIS ACCORDING TO THE PRISON REFORM TRUST OUR REPORTERS CONWAY IS HERE THAT THE BACKGROUND FIRST OF THIS WHITE WHY ARE THEY THERE WHY DID PEOPLE HAVE SENTENCES WITHOUT CLEARLY STATES IN THE FIRST PLACE
SAY THIS SENTENCE AND I P. P. STANDS FOR IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION IT WAS INTRODUCED BY LABOUR IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND IT WAS ONLY MEANT TO APPLY TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED OFFENDERS SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED IT WAS APPLIED FAR MORE WIDELY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE ENDED UP WITH THIS SENTENCE AND THE SYSTEM SIMPLY COULDN'T COPE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET OUT OF PRISON WHEN YOU'RE ON AN I.P. P. IS IF YOU CAN PROVE TO A PAROLE ORDEAL NO LONGER A RISK TO THE PUBLIC
BUT WHAT KEN CLARKE SAID WHEN HE ABOLISHED IT IN TWENTY TWELVE HE SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE IN PRISON WHETHER YOU ARE OR AREN'T GOING TO OFFEND AGAIN AND WHAT BECAME CLEAR IS THERE SIMPLY WEREN'T THE RESOURCES FOR THE PAROLE BOARD TO DO ITS WORK FOR THE PRISONERS TO MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM SO PEOPLE AND YOU'VE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE HAVEN'T YOU WHO HAVE THESE SENTENCES AND WHO ARE SAYING WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LOSING HOPE THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOT HAVING A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO RELEASE DATE SO WE HAD A LETTER FROM ALAN LITTLE HE'S A PRISONER WHO WAS GIVEN AN EYE P. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN FOR G.B.H. IT WAS A MINIMUM OF FOUR YEARS HE'S BEEN IN PRISON FOR TEN YEARS AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID HIS LETTER BEEN VOICED UP BY A PRODUCER
JUST PUT YOURSELF WHERE I AM I SPENT THIRTEEN YEARS AWAY FROM HOME I WENT INTO CARE AGED FOURTEEN FROM CARE TO PRISON AGED SIXTEEN AND NOW I'M TWENTY SEVEN
WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE FAMILY OF DANNY WHETHER CERTAIN HE WAS GIVEN A THIRTEEN MONTH I.P. P. HE'S BEEN IN PRISON FOR NINE YEARS NOW FOR ROBBERY HE IS CARRYING OUT TERRIBLE ACTS OF SELF HARM AND HIMSELF AS HIS SOLICITOR SHIRLEY NOW BOOKS SHIRLEY NOBLE EXPLAINS
OF LATE HE'S MADE QUITE A SEVERE CUT TO HIS NECK WHICH REQUIRED HOSPITALISATION
HE'S ALSO MADE QUITE SEVERE COACH TO HIS LEG AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE HAVE ANY MOBILITY IN THE FUTURE
TO SEE THAT THE SELF HARM IS TO RELIEVE ANY RELEASED HIS ANGST FRUSTRATION IT AT THAT BECAUSE OF THE STAGE YOU START WITH THIS
JUST BRIEFLY WHAT HAVE THE CAMPAIGNERS WANT DONE WELL TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF URGENCY THERE ARE NOW FOUR HUNDRED I. P. P. PRISONERS WHO HAVE ALREADY SERVED FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE AT THE PRISON REFORM TRUST ARE SAYING THEY'RE EXTREMELY CONCERNED BY THESE RATES OF SELF HARM THEY NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO TURN THESE SENTENCES INTO FIXED TERM SENTENCES SO THESE PRISONERS CAN PROGRESS THE GOVERNMENT SAY THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT THIS
URGENTLY RIGHT AND YOUR FULL REPORT TEN PAST EIGHT THANKS THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE IRAQI CITY OF FALLUJAH THE IRAQI PRIME MINISTER SAID LAST WEEK IT HAD BEEN LIBERATED FROM MORE THAN TWO YEARS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BUT ITS FIGHTERS ARE STILL HOLDING SOME AREAS AND MANY THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN ARRIVING AT DISPLACEMENT CAMPS LOVEDAY MORRIS IS THE BAGHDAD BUREAU CHIEF FOR THE WASHINGTON POST AND HAS BEEN INSIDE FOR LUCHA IN HER LAST FEW DAYS
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE CITY THEY HAVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND THEY HAVE A HOSPITAL NOW AS A LOT OF DESTRUCTION AS EXPECTED JUST BUILDING AFTER BUILDING DESTROY OBVIOUSLY ISIS USE A LOT
I SEE HE'S SO THERE'S A LOT OF DESTRUCTION THE ROADS AND THEN ALSO RELIGIOUS THEN SHELLS AND STRUCK BY AS WRITES FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW SO UM A LOT OF DEVASTATION
WHAT SENSE DID YOU GET OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S PLAN FOR THE CITY WHAT WHAT IS THE SENSE OF HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO CLEAR IT COMPLETELY HOW LONG IT MIGHT BE BEFORE THOSE IN THE DISPLACEMENT CAMPS CAN GO HOME
IN IRAQ WE'VE HAD A SITUATION WHERE EVEN AFTER CITIES AND COMPLETELY CLEAR HEADS IT'S TAKING A REALLY LONG TIME TO GET FAMILIES BACK HOME REMARK WHICH WAS CLEARED AT THE END OF THE YEAR IT'S STILL FAMILIES ARE IN CAMPS THEY DID START SENDING FAMILIES BACK TO MONEY BUT THEN THERE WAS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO THEIR HOMES AND THERE WERE STILL ISIS BOOBY TRAPS ROUND THE CITY A LOT OF PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT LET THEM BACK INTO EARLY
OUT FOR LUCIA WE STILL HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE FIGHTING STILL I'M GOING IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT READY FOR CIVILIANS TO GO BACK NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW LONG THE SUN IT COULD HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY IT COULD DRAG ON FOR WEEKS
THIS IS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT MORE CAPABLE TODAY OF OF OF PROVIDING THE THE SORT OF POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT PREVENTS ANY MORE OF THIS HAPPENING IN FUTURE
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN IS IT'S VERY MUCH A MILITARY CAMPAIGN BY FROM A COALITION SIGN AN IRAQI GOVERNMENT SIDES THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK OF POLITICAL RECONCILIATION WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ACTION ON THAT THE SPOTS AND HE'S IN A LOCKER IN A TOUGH SITUATION PROBABLY A WORSE SITUATION THAN THEY WERE BEFORE ALL THEIR SON HAD PEOPLE
THAT ARE DISPLACED EN MASSE SO REALLY THE DRIVERS THAT CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO WELCOME LIZA SINCE THEIR AREAS BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN
THOSE ISSUES HABIT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED LOVEDAY MAURICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE IRAQI M.P.

AND THEY ARE CALLING ON THE PUBLICANS TO ACT THEY'RE SHOUTING DO YOUR JOB BUT WAR WORLD IF THERE WERE TO BE A VOTE THE DEMOCRATS WOULD LOSE WOULD MAKE AS A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY
YES THERE HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED BILLS BEFORE CONGRESS I'M GOING REFORM SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN OF THEM ARE FIELD THIS ONE WOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT PROBABLY NOT BUT THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL DIVISIVE ELECTION YEAR THIS IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHANCE TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT IF YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HE WANTS ADD MOVEMENT ON GUN CONTROL AND THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT PAUL SWITCH SUGGEST THEY DO
YOU KNOW WHICH WAY TO VOTE AND THEY THIS IS A FIGHT IN THIS ELECTION YEAR TO GET WE GAIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND THESE ARE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THEIR POSSESSION VERY CLEAR ON GUN CONTROL SAYING WORK IT'S NOT OUR FAULT THAT NOTHING HAS MOVED FORWARD YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT IS THEREFORE IF YOU WANT ACTION ON THIS THEY'RE MAKING THIS AN ELECTION ISSUE NO IF YOU WANT ACTION ON THIS YOU KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO YOU'RE REBECCA IN WASHINGTON
THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE E.U. REFERENDUM AS THE LEAD IN EVERY PAPER THE TIMES HAS A SPECIAL WRAPAROUND COVER WITH THE HEADLINE DAY OF RECKONING UNDER WHICH AGREE PRINCE THE WORDING OF THE BALLOT PAPER ON ITS FRONT PAGE THE GUARDIAN HAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MAN HELPING TO CONSTRUCT ONE OF THE MANY THOUSANDS OF POLLING STATIONS WERE VOTERS WILL MAKE THEIR DECISION

NOW HERE AND ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SUNDAY'S THE DAY FOR THE POLITICAL TALK SHOW AND THE IDEA HAS SPREAD TO RUSSIA BUT THE MOSCOW VERSION OF THE ANDREW MARR SHOW WAS RATHER DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNOW THE PRESENTER DIMITRI KISSER OF COMES ACROSS AS FIERCELY PRO KREMLIN AND VEHEMENTLY ANTI WEST
LAST YEAR THE E.U. PLACED HIM ON THE SANCTIONS LISTO HIS COVERAGE OF UKRAINE DESCRIBING HIM AS A CENTRAL FIGURE OF RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA NOW IN A RARE INTERVIEW WITH THE B.B.C. MISTER KISS ANY OFFERS HIT BACK LEVELLING HIS OWN ACCUSATIONS AT THE WESTERN MEDIA HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO A MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON A SUNDAY EVENING AND IT'S TIME FOR RUSSIAN STATE TELEVISION'S FLAGSHIP NEW SHOW
THANK YOU I'M GOING TO NOBBLE THE PRESENTER IS DMITRI KISSY OFF THE PROGRAMME WHICH LASTS TWO HOURS HIS USE OF THE WEEK IT'S MOSTLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT RUSSIA
AND BAD NEWS ABOUT THE WEST
SOURCES WOULD BUY BRITISH GRACIA THIS WATCH THEM IS A MUST
MISTER KISS IT OFF DOESN'T MINCE HIS WORDS IN THE PAST HE SUGGESTED THAT IF ANGELA MERKEL WAS JAPANESE SHE COMMIT HARA KIRI ON ONE OCCASION HE COMPARED BARACK OBAMA TO THE LEADER OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
AND HE'S BOASTED THAT RUSSIA COULD REDUCE AMERICA TO RADIOACTIVE DUST BUT SO OVER ADS IN THE PAPER
HE'S NOT ONLY A NEWS ANCHOR DIMITRI KISSING OFF ALSO RUNS THE STATE MEDIA CONGLOMERATE RRGH WHICH SPREADS MOSCOW'S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD
HE'S THE ONLY RUSSIAN JOURNALIST ON THE E.U. SANCTIONS LIST AGAINST MOSCOW FOR BEING A CENTRAL FIGURE OF RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA
FOR TWO YEARS MY KISS IT OFF TURNED DOWN MY REQUEST FOR AN INTERVIEW
BUT WHEN WE MEET AT A CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW ON THE FUTURE OF MAINSTREAM MEDIA HE FINALLY AGREES TO SPEAK TO ME WELCOME TO ADDRESS FIRST
THE LAST WEEKEND OF AUGUST
TRY MY FRIEND IN CRIME
I CARE AS WE SIT DOWN TO TALK TO THE MAN WHO'S BEEN CALLED TO THE KREMLIN AS CHIEF PROPAGANDIST HIS FRIENDLINESS PERSONIFIED
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT IN THE INTERVIEW YASMIN MICE PROPAGANDA DO YOU WITH THAT I THOUGHT OF THE MICE PROPAGANDA IF I AM SPREADING PROPAGANDA AND SAW YOU BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT SPREADING PROPAGANDA AND HAVE THE YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR JOB THEM THAT APPLIES TO ME AS WELL
WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING WE'RE COLLEAGUES YOU SAID TODAY WHICH WAS INTERESTING THAT THE ERA OF NEUTRAL JOURNALISM WAS OVER WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
BUT MY MEAL NOW SPIN THE MOAI FEELING B. SEE YOU WILL BE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS THINKING OF THE RECENT B.B.C. PANORAMA FILM BUDDHA'S SECRET THERE RICHARD
IN THAT FILM A PHOTO OFF PUTTING WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A BLACK IN THE WAY THE GRAPHIC THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYEBROWS WERE PULLED DOWN SHE WAS GIVEN A POINT YOU KNOW WAS AND A DEMONIC SPARK IN HIS EYES THE KIND OF THING YOU'D SEE IN A BOO CORNERS STAGE MAKE UP FOR VILLAINS BUT THIS WAS THE B.B.C. FILM
SO IN MY SHOW I DID THE SAME TO FORT OF THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS NOT IN A TRADITIONAL SORT WOULD BE SEEN PARTIALITY THIS WAS BIASED THE JOURNALISM SO WHERE ARE LEARNING FROM THE B.B.C. BUT IT ON WE CAN STILL BE
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE B.B.C. IS NOT NEUTRAL AND THE JAM YES LIKE THEM AS WELL B. B. C. PUN WIKI THAT'S RIGHT AFTER THAT I CALLED B. B. C. A RUBBISH TIP WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOURNALISM IS THAT NEUTRAL YET NO LAKE B.B.C. JOURNALISM JOURNALISM TO MODERN NEUTRAL BUT AGE OF NEUTRAL JOURNALISM HAS PASSED
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU SELECT FROM THE HUGE SEA OF INFORMATION IS ALREADY SUBJECTIVE SO IF I SAID TO YOU THAT I AS A B.B.C. JOURNALIST TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE AND TRY TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE AND DIFFERENT SIDES WOULD YOU THINK THAT'S NOT TRUE
YOU SAY YOU SHOW A DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND THAT YOU WERE OBJECTIVE BUT THAT IS SIMPLY A MYTH BUSTING ME FOR THAT IT'S A BIG DECEPTION IT IS A BIG PROPAGANDA THAT'S IT THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S INTERVIEW OVER WHEN I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN IN THE RING WITH THE MUHAMMAD ALI OF KREMLIN BROADCASTING
DMITRI KISSING OFF FLOAT EFFORTLESSLY LIKE A BUTTERFLY THROUGH ANY TOPIC AND BOY DOES HE STAYING
IN TEN MINUTES I'VE HEARD THE B.B.C. DESCRIBED AS BIASED AND A RUBBISH TIP HE'S ACCUSED ME OF PROPAGANDA AND DECEPTION
BUT WHEN I BUMP INTO MISTER KISSING OFF THE NEXT DAY AT THE MEDIA FORUM HE GIVES ME A WARM SMILE A STRONG HANDSHAKE
MY FRIEND HE EXCLAIMS NICE TO KNOW IT WAS NOTHING PERSONAL
STEVE ROSENBERG ARE REPORTING FROM MOSCOW THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN COULD A NEW EFFORT AT CHESTER ZOO BE THEIR LAST CHANCE TO SAVE THE MOUNTAIN CHICKEN FROG IT'S CRITICALLY ENDANGERED WITHIN NINETY PER CENT DECLINED IN ITS POPULATION IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S NATIVE HABITAT IS THE CARIBBEAN THE BREEDING PROGRAMME IS BEING RUN BY DOCTOR GERARDO GARCIA WHO'S CURATOR OF LOWER VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES AT CHESTER ZOO AND HE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY IS THE MOUNTAIN CHICKEN FROG WORTH SAVING
ONCE AGAIN IS QUITE A UNIQUE SPECIES IS THE LARGEST FROG YOU CAN SEE IN THE CARIBBEAN BUT ITSELF PLAYS A UNIQUE ROLE IN THE SYSTEMS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PREDATORS YOU'LL FIND ON THE LAND AND ALSO THERE IS ENORMOUS THE HERE INTENT OF UNDERSTANDING HODGE TO PROTECT THE ABBEY DAD SAW NOT ONLY CHANCE THE FROG BUT AS WELL
THE DIFFERENT BURST DIFFER INVERTEBRATES SO JUST KIND OF THE FLAK OFF WHICH IS HAPPENING MANY HOBBITS ARE ON THE WAR AND WHY HAS IT BEEN SO DECIMATED THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN SO DECIMATED IN THE WILD
IT'S BEEN A COMPOSITIONAL DIFFERENT THREADS STARTED WITH THE HABITAT DESTRUCTION IT GOOD TUNES OF THE CONSUMPTION
BECAUSE OF THE NAME SADIST MODERN CHICKENS AND CHICKEN IS A BIG FROG HE COULD REACH UP TO ONE KILL THEN IT HAPPENS AS WORLD THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH WILL CAN ACTIVITIES AND THE LAST AND THE MOST SERIOUS UNTHREATENING ELEMENT
IS THERE A BRAKE I THINK IT WAS FOR MOST NEEDS FOLDERS THAT IS SPECIFIC EFFORT I'VE GOT ALMOST DECIMATED THE SPECIES FROM THE TWO ISLANDS SO NOW THAT HE'S TRY SOMETHING YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE WITH THIS WITH THIS BREEDING PROGRAMME HOW MANY FROGS ARE INVOLVED AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BOOST YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS
WE STARTED WOULD UP WOULD YOU RESCUE OPERATION IN CEMENT NINE WITH THE OUTBREAK OF THESE FUNGUS APPEAR IN MONSERRAT AND WE'VE GOT FIFTY FIVE FERAL ANIMALS BUT HE'S SLOWLY BUT MANY DIFFERENT REEF SONS BECAUSE THE ANIMAL IS PRETTY SENSITIVE WE HAVE ALL THE PROBLEMS LABOUR TERRY SEERS WITH DIFFERENT TYPE OF HUMOUR ISN'T STONES AT THE DOOR BROTHER SAUL AND WILL BE FROM
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ON THE FERTILITY RATE DROPPING NOW WE'VE GOT HAVE THE NUMBER AT ALL ONLY JUST TEN TWELVE PAIR HAVE BEEN B. TO BREED SO BASICALLY WE WE JUST JUGGLING WITH A LASHING THE ABILITY NOR HANSON BUT YOU BUT YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TO IT TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES IN TERMS OF HOW YOUR PAIRING THEM UP YOUR MATCHMAKING THEM SOMEHOW
WE USE IT THE MOST DEVELOPED TECHNIQUE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH IT MORE GENETICALLY BY BALL MUCH FIN
THAT WE HAVE AND THIS IS A CONSORT OF BETWEEN FOUR INSTITUTIONS WHAT WE HAVE IN YOU COULD WE HAVE CHESTER WE HAVE LONDON JERSEY AND HAVE ANOTHER IN YOUR DISH AND NORTHERN ZACH IN SWEDEN SO WE TOOK THE FOUR OF US WE PUT ALL THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER AND GENETICALLY MATCH IN THE LAST PAIRS YOU COULD BE THE BEST HOPE AND CHANCES FOR BREEDING OH KAY BUT THERE BUT THEY YOU HE PUT THEM TOGETHER AT CHESTER ZOO AND HOPE THAT NATURE THEN TAKES ITS COURSE
YES WE HAVE JUST THAT WE HAVE FOUR PAIRS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY SLATED IN A UNIT WE'RE NOBODY FI SHIPPING CONTAINER AND HOPEFULLY THAT FOUR PAIRS I'VE GOING TO DO WHAT HE SHOULDN'T DO WOULD GENERALLY MIDSUMMER TIMES SO HOT WE HAD THAT CHANCE TO PUSH THE GENNED POPULATION
OH KAY WERE PERHAPS ANOTHER REASON TO HOPE THAT THE RAIN HOLDS OFF DOCTOR GIRARDI GARCIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HA HUNTS AROUND THE COUNTRY THROWING FOX CUBS TO DOGS IN ORDER TO TRAIN THEM TO KILL THEM HEATHER'S AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY SURROUNDING THE SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE HUNT AND THERE'VE BEEN THREE ARRESTS THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE HUNT INVESTIGATION TEAM WHICH CAMPAIGNS AGAINST FOX HUNTING AND SECRETLY FILMED PICTURES IT SAYS OF DEAD FOXES
THEY DON'T NATURALLY HUNT FOXES THEY HAVE TO BE TAUGHT TO RECOGNISE FOXES AS PREY AND ALSO NOT TONY TO HUNT THEM BUT TO KILL THEM WE BELIEVE THAT THIS EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT
FOX CUBS WERE ACTUALLY THROWN TO THE HOUSE OR GIVEN TO THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE BODIES CAME OUT SO IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT CHASING THEM THIS IS ABOUT KILLING THEM AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S A TRAINING TECHNIQUE THIS WIDESPREAD ACROSS
TALK TO EDWARD HAD WHAT A GUN SALVOS WHO IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S BEING SHOWN IN THESE PICTURES AND SOUNDS SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AN INVESTIGATION FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS NOW USING A NUMBER OF FORMER POLICE OFFICERS AMONGST OTHERS INTO THE MOST ABHORRENT PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH ILLEGAL HUNTING
INCLUDING CUBBING WHICH IS THE TAKING OF YOUNG FOX CUBS FROM THE WILD ARE USING THEM FOR ILLEGAL HUNTING AND HE ALSO USED TO TRAIN NEUF HUNT'S HOUNDS TO FIND AND KILL FOXES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WAS GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT'S WE'VE DISCOVERED WITH THE HELP OF OUR PARTNERS AREN'T INVESTIGATION TEAM SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENTS
BECAUSE IN THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE HUNT GET THE DOG STOOD TO WANT TO HUNT IT'S NOT IN THEIR NATURAL INSTINCTS THEY HAVE TO TRAIN THEM TO DO THIS AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT HUNTS EUTHANISE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN THOUSAND HUNTING DOGS EVERY YEAR
SO THEY'RE BRINGING ON NEW FRESH HOUNDS EVERY YEAR AS WELL AND THEY NEED TO TRAIN THEM TO LEARN THE SENSE AND ACTUALLY LEARN THE AGGRESSION TO FOLLOW AND THEN KILL FOXES WHAT THE COUNTRYSIDE ALLIANCE SAYS IS THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH NORMAL HUNTING ACTIVITY THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SUCH BEHAVIOUR IN REGISTERED HUNTS
WELL I'M AFRAID THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE IT IS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE HUNTING INDUSTRY WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE STILL AN ILLEGAL ELEMENTS THAT'S GOING ON SO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE HUNTING ACT WAS INTRODUCED TEN YEARS AGO WAS THAT SOME HUNTS QUITE RIGHTLY TRANSFERRED INTO DRAG HUNTING WHICH HAS GOT ALL THE CEREMONY THE PAGEANTRY THE HORSE RACING AND SO ON BUT NONE OF THE ANIMAL CRUELTY BUT SOMEONE FORTUNATELY CONTINUED TO HUNT ILLEGALLY AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT IS THEY STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING HUMP INTO IF YOU LIKED IT TO BE READY TO GO OUT THERE AND KILL FOXES
ADMIN IN THE TOURIST THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK PLENTY OF I'M IN THERE ARE HUNTING ACTIVITIES THERE ARE STILL LEGAL AREN'T BUT BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE LEGAL ACTIVITIES NOT WHAT'S CHASING WILD ANIMALS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND SHOOTING THEM IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES STILL LEGAL BUT THIS SOMETHING DIFFERENT WELL THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT'S PERMITTED UNDER THE HUNTING ACTORS THAT'S YOU CAN IF IT IS FELT THAT THERE IS A PARTICULARLY PREDATORY FOX
YOU CAN FLUSH THAT FOX TO TO USING TWO DOGS TO GUNS BUT THIS ISN'T WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT YOU NEED THE DOGS TOOK TO WANT TO FLUSH THE FOX DON'T YOU BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT PACKS OF HOUNDS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THROUGH THESE CUBS INTO KENNELS WITH PACKS OF HOUNDS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY THEN USING THOSE HOUNDS AND YOU'LL SEE THIS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY UNFORTUNATELY MANY HUNTS ARE GOING OUT WITH PACKS OF HOUNDS VILLAGE MANY AND THAT BUT THOSE HOUNDS YOU'RE ALLEGING
AND NOT JUST TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAY IN MANY CASES YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE HOUNDS HAVE BEEN PERSUADED TO DO THIS TRAIN TO DO THIS WITH ILLEGAL AND CRUEL METHODS
THAT'S RIGHT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HUNTING OUT AS BEING ENFORCED ROBUSTLY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT LESS SO BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING US HUNTS ARE CREATING AND MAINTAINING ARTIFICIAL DENS IN ORDER TO DELIBERATELY BREED AND ENCOURAGED SOMETIMES ALSO TRAP FOXES SO THEY CAN THEN BE USED FOR HUNTING AT WELL AGAINST OTHERS CHIP IS OUT OF THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THE CHARITY SAYS A LACK OF RESOURCES TO ASSESS THE RISK BUT I P. P. PRISONERS COULD POSE TO THE PUBLIC EXPLAINS WHY SO MANY REMAIN BEHIND BARS
THE SELF HARM RATE IS HIGHER AMONGST I P.P. PRISONERS THAN THOSE ON FIXED TERM SENTENCES AND LIFE SENTENCES
THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE SAYS IT URGENTLY LOOKING HAD I. P. P. OFFENDERS AND HE'S PUTTING MONEY INTO IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN PRISON

CONSERVATIONISTS AT CHESTER ZOO BEGAN A BREEDING PROGRAMME TO TRY TO SAVE THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AMPHIBIAN THE MOUNTAIN CHICKEN FROG FROM EXTINCTION ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF THE FROG'S REMAIN IN THE WILD ON THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF DOMINICA AND MONTSERRAT IS A SCIENCE REPORTER VICTORIA GILL
AT TWENTY TWO CENTIMETRES LONG THE MOUNTAIN CHICKEN IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST FROGS IT'S UNUSUAL NAME COMES FROM ITS SIZE AND THE FACT THAT IN ITS NATIVE CARIBBEAN IT'S COMMONLY EATEN BUT WHAT WAS ONCE A VERY WIDESPREAD CREATURE HAS BEEN LARGELY WIPED OUT BY A FUNGAL DISEASE CALLED KITTRIDGE
NOW A TEAM OF EUROPEAN CONSERVATIONISTS HAD GENETICALLY SCREENED AND MATCHED THE TWELVE BREEDING PAIRS OF MOUNTAIN CHICKENS THAT REMAIN IN CAPTIVITY
AT CHESTER ZOO FOUR OF THESE PRECIOUS PAIRS OF FROGS HAD BEEN MOVED INTO A SHIPPING CONTAINER THAT'S BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMPHIBIAN BREEDING CENTRE THE HOPE IS THAT THIS TINY TROPICAL HAVEN WILL BE THE START OF A BREEDING PROGRAMME THAT COULD SEE THE FROGS RETURNED TO THE WILD

WILL BE YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE IT WE WERE ON THE FLOOR AND
WHERE DOES THIS LEAD WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE WHAT WE SIMPLY WANT IT WELL DONE TWO MEASURES ONE WHICH SAYS ANYWHERE IN AMERICA
WE HAVE A GRID WHICH SEEMS TO BE IN THE GRIPS OF THE GUN LOBBY IS UNWILLING TO COMMIT IT STRAIGHT UP AT THE UNBOWED ARE WHETHER ANYONE WHO TRIES TO BUY A GUN IN AMERICA SHE HAD TO FIRST UNDERGO
YOU ARE A ARNIE CARROTS WATERWORKS ANY NO WHY WAS IT SO THAT YOU CAN'T GET ON A PLANE IN AMERICA DIDN'T YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK OUT OF A GHOST STORE WHIP IS AN AROMATIC WEAPON THAT LETS YOU COMMIT THAT MURDER AT THIS ALL I KNOW IT LOOKS FLORA AND WE ARE ALL BE THERE WE
UPPER DOWN WHERE DID WE WIN OR LOSE IT'LL BE A BIT OF OLD UP OR DOWN AND DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN DOING
OH BUT THE BADGERS ALL PRETTY
AND VERY SENSIBLE IT'S SIMPLY A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING GO AND GET IT TO THE HEAD THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT AT THAT DUMP WHERE THEY BE TERRORIST OR WHETHER THEY BE PEOPLE OR LAMENT TILL YOU'VE SPIRIT GOING TO SCHOOL
IS THIS THE BEGINNING COULD THIS BE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING THAT DOES RESULT IN SERIOUS GUN CONTROL PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN THOSE MEASURES YOU'VE OUTLINED D. DO YOU THINK THE COUNTRY IS REACHING A POINT WHERE IT'S READY FOR THAT OR NOT MY SENSES THAT AMERICAN SEPARATE READY SANDERSTEAD DARK ANSWER AND SAFETY MEASURES FOR QUITE SOME TIME
BOYD LIMIT THEY STEAL LIKE ARGOS WILL DO NOT OBEY AND QUITE HONESTLY
TYPICAL PIG YET ANY LEISURE ARE HORRIBLE IF THE MAJORITY WISHES TO SHOW
BY THAT IS THAT I WATCH THEM KOSICE ARE IN TOY SIXTEEN MY SENSES IF AMERICA DEREK'S JUST TOOK YOU TO THE INTERNET
I BELIEVE YOU LET OUT A PEEP
THE OTHER SARAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN DO PRISONERS WITHOUT A CLEAR A RELEASE STATE HAVE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF HARMING THEMSELVES WHILE IN CUSTODY THAT'S THE BELIEF OF THE PRISON REFORM TRUST CHARITY WHICH SAYS THAT THEY SHOW DRAMATIC LEVELS OF SELF HARM AND HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO DESPAIR WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR NIGEL BLACKWOOD WHO'S A CLINICAL ACADEMIC AND FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON AND A CONSULTANT AT HER MAJESTY'S PRISON WANDSWORTH
GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THERE IS A LINK HERE I THINK THAT'S UNDOUBTEDLY A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS WHICH CAN PREVAIL WITH AN INDETERMINATE SENTENCE WITHOUT A CLEAR END IN SIGHT
IS THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU HEAR FROM PRISONERS WHEN IN THIS POSITION WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM YES UNDOUBTEDLY THE ABSOLUTELY KEY FACT FOR US IS THAT SUCH PRISONERS SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO SIMPLE WE'RE HARASSING AND THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO A TREATMENT PROGRAMMES AND PHOEBE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC HELP
TO HELP TO UNDERSTAND AND THEN IN TURN MANAGE THEIR RISKS THERE HOW WOULD YOU HELP SOMEONE IF YOU'RE ASSIGNED TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN THIS POSITION OF NOT HAVING ANY IDEA WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALLOWED OUT HOW WOULD YOU TRY AND HELP THEM WITH THESE ARE TYPICALLY MEN CONVICTED OF VIOLENT OR A SEXUAL OFFENCES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEEMED SERIOUS
THEREFORE THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO USE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAMMES AND THE CRIMINAL LOGICAL TREATMENT PROGRAMMES THAT HELP TO REDUCE THEIR RISKS SO THIS IS THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF MENTAL ILLNESS WITHIN THIS GROUP
IT'S A ONE IN FIVE COMING INTO PRISON WILL HAVE A SERIOUS SUBS MISUSE ISSUE ONE AND SEVEN ONE OF THE MAJOR ILLNESS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA OR MAJOR DEPRESSION SO THEY NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MENTAL WHO IN MANY CASES THAT WILL BE PRE EXISTING RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPS WHILE THEY ARE IN CUSTODY YES THERE IS A PROPORTION WHO DEVELOP MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING IMPRISONED
BUT THOSE FIGURES ARE COMING INTO PRISON WITH THOUGHTS ILLNESSES AND FROM YOUR EXPOSE FOR THE PRISON SYSTEM IN IT IF IF THERE WAS A GREATER EMPHASIS ON GIVING A RELEASE DATE GIVEN THE NATURE OF OF
THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE IN FOR ALL THEIR BALL THEIR PERCEIVED RISK TO THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING HE WAS KEPT UNDER CLOSE REVIEW WOULDN'T IT OR AT LEAST REVIEWED CLOSE TO A RELEASE DATE YES ABSOLUTELY SAW RIPPED CAREFUL REPORTS ARE PREPARED ON THESE PRISONERS FOR THEIR PAROLE BOARD HEARINGS BOTH BY OURSELVES PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND THEIR OFFENDER MANAGER IS THAT SEED INTO THOSE PAROLE BOARD DECISIONS O.K. BUT WHEN THOSE WINDOWS
MOMENTS DON'T GO ACCORDING TO THE WAY THE PRISONER HOPES FOR WHAT WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON THEM YES THERE'S A POTENTIAL THEN FOR THEIR HOPELESSNESS TO INCREASE AND FOR A SENSE OF DESPAIR TO PREVAIL SO THERE ARE CAREFUL PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT IF SELF HARMING BECOMES A PROBLEM IN THE WAKE OF SUCH INSTANCE
AND THE A.C.C. T. PROGRAMME WITHIN PRISON HELPS US TO MANAGE THAT IN A MONTH TO SPLINTERY SENSE IS THAT HAPPENING BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S THESE LEVELS OF SELF HARM PRISONERS SERVING SENTENCES OF IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION SELF HARMING AT TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE RATE OF THOSE WITH LIFE SENTENCES
YES THAT'S CORRECT SO THIS IS CLEARLY A POPULATION WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE DEMANDS BEING MADE OF THEM AND ALL OF THEIR HAD PROLONGED WAITS FOR TREATMENT PROGRAMMES THAT WILL HELP THEM TO PROGRESS HE'S NOT MANDATED BY THE PAROLE BOARD BUT NEVERTHELESS COMPLETING SUCH PROGRAMMES HELPS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING THEIR RISKS WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF OF
DEALING WITH THESE SORTS OF PRISONERS TALKING TO BE THOUGHTS OF PRISONERS AND SAYS PATIENTS
I THINK THEY SEEK HELP AND THEY SEEK A CLEAR TIME LINE THROUGH TO THEIR RELEASE WITH ACCESS TO THEIR PROGRAMMES AND I THINK THE MAJOR PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH AT THE MOMENT IS THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND PRODUCTION AND PRISON OFFICERS AND ING LESS ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES AS A RESULT
DOCTOR NIGEL BLACKWOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN TESCO THE U.K.'S BIGGEST RETAILER JUST PUBLISHING ITS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS FOR THIS YEAH ARE THEY DOING BETTER DOMINIKA COME ON IS IT THANKS JUST YES THEY ARE THERE ARE SIGNS OF A CONTINUING RECOVERY AT TESCO
WHICH IS JUST REPORTED AN OVERALL SALES RISE OF NOUGHT POINT NINE PER CENT IN THE U.K. GROWTH OF NOUGHT POINT THREE PER CENT THERE'S NEVER SECOND QUARTER AND AROMA IT'S REPORTED A GROWTH IN THE U.K. AN INEXORABLE NUGGET IT SELLING IT'S COFFEE CHAIN HOUSE IN HALL TO CAFE NERO I'M JOINED BY A BREED EM ON TIME TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS HE USED TO WORK AT TESCO NOW HE'S AN ANALYST
AT THE FINANCIAL NOUS AS FIRM BERNSTEIN BRYN QUITE A GOOD SET OF RESULTS CERTAINLY A BIG TURNAROUND FROM A YEAR OR SO AGO WIND CELLS WERE FALLING LIKE A STONE AS A GOOD MORNING HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE CHANGE IN TRADING FORTUNE IS NOW THE SECOND QUARTER IN THE ROLE
BUT WAS IT A WINTERY WAS HER MY NOT SOUND LIKE A BIG NUMBER THIS IS IN THE QUARTERED AT TESCO'S LINDA BEG BIGGEST EVER PRICE GOOD THERE FOR MANY YEARS THIS FARM BRAND THAT THEY TALK ABOUT IT'S EFFECTIVELY A TWENTY PERCENT PRICE COULD ALMOST ON THE CORE PRODUCTS OF MEAT FISH POULTRY AND PRODUCE SO IT WAS REALLY REMARKABLE OFFICER WE WANT THEM TO LOOK AT VOLUME GROWTH SO HOW MANY MORE UNITS DO YOU DO BY THE GROWING AT A TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT CENT THAT REALLY SAYS AS THE BRITISH CONSUMED HAVE STOPPED
LEAVING THE TESCO'S THOUGHT YVETTE ANYTHING THEY GRADUALLY STARTING TO COME BACK AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE MOST MOST IMPORTANT SIGN FOR ANY RETAILER SO CAN WE TAKE THIS IS SOME EVIDENCE THEN THAT WHAT DAVE LEWIS TESCO'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS DOING TO COMBAT THE DISCOUNTERS I'LL BE IN LITTLE HAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO WORK
FROM A CONSUMER POINT OF VIEW YES CLEARLY PEOPLE SEE LIKE WILL DO SEE END OF STORES TO KEEP COMING BACK AND YOU CAN PROBABLY COMING RETURNING FROM SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SHOPS AS A VERY STRONG SCIENCE EVERYTHING INDICATES A MUCH AND THE SAME OF HARRISON HALL FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HOWSON HALL WAS THIS IN THE HOUSE IN STORE COFFEE CHAIN THE TESCO BOUGHT ON THEIR EXPANDED WHY ARE THEY SELLING IT AND THAT'S KIND OF IN KEEPING WITH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING RECENTLY ISN'T IT
IS ALMOST TO QUESTION IT WANTED IT FIRST BY THEN SELLING AT A DESK HAS VERY LARGE STORES WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEGINNING PROGRAMME SO HAVING ALL THE THINGS TO DO IN A STORE A GOOD THING WHEN IT'S YOUR DRY CLEANING PICKING UP A CUP OF COFFEE DOES GOOD USES WORD IN THE TESCO AND THE WRONG WAS TRIED TO PUT HIS OWN MONEY AT STAKE AND INVEST IN THEIR OWN BUSINESS THERE'S PLENTY OF COFFEE SHOPS AROUND THE LEVEL A GOOD STORE WOULD BE WILLING TO RENT
AND SO THE NEW C.O.'S CLEARLY RATIONALISING OR THAN FOCUSING THEIR BUSINESS AND DOING WILL TESCO'S GOOD AT WHICH IS SELLING FOOD NOT REALLY MAKING COFFEE BECAUSE IN THIS FOCUS ON ON QUARTERLY SALES WERE KINDA MISSING A BIG PICTURE HERE DAVE LEWIS HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT SINCE HE ARRIVED OUT OF CHINA AT LEAST PARTLY OUT OF CHINA TURKEY HE HAD A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL RETRENCHMENT AND HE SOLD A LOT OF BUSINESSES IS HE DOING THE RIGHT THING
SO FAR YES OF GIVING IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN HE'S RATIONALISE THEIR PORTFOLIO AND THE BIGGEST THING TO DO YOU K. IT WAS ALMOST ANYTING YOU WANT MATT TO DO WITH YOUR K. DOESN'T DO ANY BETTER THE BIGGEST QUESTION FROM AN INVESTMENT POINT OF VIEW US I'M GOING TO MAKE ENOUGH PROFIT ON AS A BUSINESS AND QUESTION ARE STILL FULLY AN UNDECIDED FROM A CONSUMER POINT OF VIEW HE'S GONE WAY FASTER AND I WOULD SAY IN A WAY DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY EXPECTED EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GO FOR A PRICE WAR AND HE'S BEEN WAY BRAW THAT HE'S FOCUSING ON AVAILABILITY SERVERS MAKING THE THOSE BETTER AND NICER
AND IN A WAY MORE INTELLIGENT WAY THAN JUST CUTTING PRICES AROUND THEM ACROSS THE BOARD AND ON THAT LAST POINT DO YOU THINK TESCO'S OUT OF THE WOODS YOU TOUCH ON THE IDEA THAT SHAREHOLDERS WILL HAVE TO EXPECT LOW RETURNS DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ASK THOSE SHAREHOLDERS FOR MORE MONEY HE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR BUT HE WON'T NEED SOME HELP
AT THIS STAGE WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ASK FOR MORE MONEY TESCO'S SORT CAREER SITTING ON TWO BILLION POUNDS OF UNUSED CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET EVENT ITSELF RIGHT NOW NOT TO PROFIT BUT IT'S LEFT HIM PROVE IT IF YOU RAISE MORE CASH HE WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO A BIT OF REALLY SELL AND MAYBE HAVE THE FORGED IN THE U.K. GO BAD AGAIN THEN THE SALES GO ON THE OTHER RIGHT WAY AGAIN THEN MAYBE TWO OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW WHO KNOWS BUT AT THIS STAGE IT'S NOT NONSENSICAL SO I THINK SHE MAY HAVE A BITTER TESCO THANK YOU MUCH POORER MONT TRAIN BUT

IT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT CHOIR WAS LITTLE ELLIE BUTLER SIX YEARS OLD AND LOVING LIFE WITH HER GRANDPARENTS RIPPED FROM THEM BY THE COURTS AND SENT TO LIVE WITH HER VIOLENT PARENTS TO BE KILLED EVENTUALLY BY HER FATHER THIS QUESTION IS AT THE HEART OF THIS TERRIBLE CASE WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN SO MUCH PUBLICITY IN RECENT DAYS IT RAISES ISSUES
WIDER ISSUES ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE FAMILY COURTS ABOUT THE REASONING OF THE INDIVIDUAL JUDGE MISTER JUSTICE HOGG WHO SEND HURLEY BACK WHEN SHE ANNOUNCED THAT DECISION IN COURT THIS IS WHAT TERRY'S GRANDFATHER NEIL GRAY REVEAL TO US YESTERDAY THAT HE HAD SAID TO HER
I SAID I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A CONSCIENCE OR SO BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU MIGHT HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS WITH REGARDS TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER ELLIE WHY DID THEY GET IT SO WRONG ALL THOSE PEOPLE
I THINK I WANTED A QUICK FIX IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE THAT INTERESTING
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY FORK TO BACK MYSELF OR MY WIFE WHO'S NOW DEPARTED FROM THIS WORLD TO KEEP ELLIE BUT WE SHE'S CHIPPED JUSTICE HOG HAD IN OUR MINDS BUT WE I THINK THAT WE WERE UNWORTHY TO LOOK AFTER HER
IN A MOMENT WE WILL TALK TO HER FORMER FAMILY COURT JUDGE LET'S TALK FIRST THAT KRISTIN DAVIS WHO CHAIRS THE SUTTONS SAFEGUARDING CHILDRENS' BOARD SUTTON IS THE PLACE IN SOUTH LONDON WHERE THE PARENTS LIPS UP AND SOCIAL SERVICES BACK TO THEIR GRANDPARENTS' CASE TO KEEP KELLY KRYTEN EVER GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING JUST IN FROM ONE OF THE THINGS AT THE HEART OF THIS CASE HAS BEEN THE WORD EXONERATED THAT MISSUS JUSTICE HOG INSISTED WAS USED AND OFFICIALLY STAMPED ON DOCUMENTS REGARDING THIS CASE A CASE THAT SHE TOOK
SUTTON SOCIAL SERVICES AT HOW MUCH IMPACT DO YOU THINK THAT HAD ON WHAT SUBSEQUENTLY HAPPENED
I THINK IT HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BUT COULD I JUST SAY THAT ALL OF OUR THOUGHTS AT THE MOMENT IN RELATION TO THIS SAD DEATH ARE WITH ELLIE'S GRANDFATHER WHO CARED FOR EARLY WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WITH SUCH DEEP CARE AND LOVE FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HER LIFE
THE UM THE THE DECISION BY THE FAMILY COURT JUDGE TO EXONERATE BEN BUTLER FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ELLIE'S INJURIES AND STATING SOUND FANATICALLY THAT HE HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
AND THAT THERE WAS A PERFECTLY INNOCENT EXPLANATION FOR ELLA'S INJURIES IS IS A VERY SURPRISING JUDGEMENT
IT WASN'T A SURPRISE THAT SHE UPHELD THE QUASHING OF BEN BUT PREVIOUS CONVICTION FOR GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM BECAUSE THERE WAS THERE WAS A. AND MIXED VIEW OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE AND IT WAS NOT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT BUT SHE WENT VERY MUCH FURTHER IN HER EXONERATION ABEND BEN BUTLER AND AS YOU SAY
SHE THEN TOOK THE UNPRECEDENTED STEP OF INSTRUCTING THAT A LETTER WILL BE SENT TO ALL AGENCIES AND SERVICES STATING THAT BEN BUTLER WAS INNOCENT I HAVE CAUSING ALISON AND HOW MUCH DAMAGE DO YOU THINK THAT LETTER DID
WELL WHAT WELL WHAT IT DID IN EFFECT WAS TO UM
IN EFFECT WIPE THE RECORD CLEAN OF ALL BEN BUTLER'S PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS AND IT MEANT THAT NO THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR ANY AND CHILD PROTECTION ARRANGEMENTS OR CHILD PROTECTION ORDERS TO BE PUT IN PLACE WHICH WOULD HAVE
PROTECTED ELLIE CERTAINLY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN IN FACT SHE WAS HE LOOKING SO HE HANDED ALL THE POWER TO BEN BUTLER BECAUSE THE JUDGE ALSO GAVE PERMISSION FOR BEN BUTLER HIMSELF AND JENNY GREY
TO USE THIS LETTER OF EXONERATION WITH HIS LAWYERS SO THAT WHENEVER ANY OF THE AGENCIES AND SERVICES RAISED THEY CONCERN WITH HIM OR JENNY GRAY ABOUT ELLIE THE LETTER
WAS USED BY BEN BUTLER AND HIS LAWYERS VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO TO PUSH BACK ANY SERVICE OR AGENCY WHO RAISED THE QUESTION
KRISTIN DAVIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US LET'S TURN TO SIR MARK HEADLEY WHO IS A FORMER FAMILY COURT JUDGE SHE WAS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE APPEAL OF BEN BUTLER FOR THAT EARLIER CONVICTION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST HELEN APPEAL THAT WAS ONE GOOD MORNING TO YOU SIR MARK
GOOD COULD I ASK YOU FIRST ABOUT THIS WORD EXONERATED THAT MISSUS JUSTICE HOG USED IT IS IT IS IT A WORD THAT SURPRISE YOU IN THIS CONTEXT
WHAT WERE YOU SURPRISED IN THIS CASE GIVEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT
A JUDGEMENT FAITHFULLY IN A COURT OF MORE WIDELY SIR MARK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SOMEONE WHO LOOKED AT THIS CASE AND SEVERAL HERE WE GO AGAIN THERE IS A TENDENCY TO BELIEVE ON THE PART NOT JUST OF JUDGES BIT OF OFFICIALDOM MORE GENERALLY A TENDENCY TO BELIEVE MANIPULATIVE ADULTS PARTICULARLY MIDDLE CLASS MANIPULATIVE ADULTS AND NOT THE CHILDREN
THE MISSUS JUSTICE I WAS PLAINLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS MAN WITH BUTLER SHE CALLED HIM THOUGHTFUL AND IMPRESS
DO YOU WHO WOULD DO THAT THERE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL EDITORIAL ABOUT THIS IN THE GUARDIAN TODAY IN THE GUARDIAN HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE SCENES DOING QUITE A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO GET MORE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THIS CASE AND OTHERS BUT WHAT THEY CONCLUDE IS ACTUALLY THAT APPEAL THAT WE HEARD ON THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY FROM ELLIE'S GRANDFATHER FROM NEIL GRAY
THAT APPEAL FOR AN INQUIRY NOW IN WHICH THE JUDGE HERSELF TAKES PA THAT ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE WRONG IT WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE A JUDGE SHOULD NEVER BE HELD TO ACCOUNT BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE COURT SYSTEM TO DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THAT
AND THANK YOU
I THINK IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY SUTTON COUNCIL DECIDED NOT TO APPEAL BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR REASONING WAS IN IT SO MARC HADLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND KRISTIN DAVIS AS WELL FROM SUTTON SAFEGUARDING THANK YOU THAT IRON IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS DAY OF RECKONING IS THE HEADLINE IN THE TIMES WHICH IN COMMON WITH EVERY OTHER PAPER LEADS WITH THE E.U.

FOR GENDER EQUALITY DONNING HER ARMOUR TAKING UP HER LANCE WILL BE NIKKI WILLIS FROM STRESS ON WHO GOES BY THE NAME OF LADY NICOLETTE OF SAINT WREATH THEM SHE TELLS HER TIMES MEN HAVE NO INHERENT ADVANTAGE IN THE SPORTS MORE TECHNIQUE THAN IT IS ABOUT THE TIME OF SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT IS STOPPAGE TIME ICELAND VERSES AUSTRIA AUSTRIA ARE GOING FOR THE WIN THAT WOULD SURPRISE NO ONE THEN A BREAK AWAY AND THE MOMENT THAT ICELANDIC TELEVISION WILL REMEMBER FOR MANY A LONG
AND ACTUALLY WENT ON MUCH LONGER THAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TIME THAT MEANS A COURSE NOT ONLY BUT ICELAND GET INTO THE LAST SIXTEEN WAS BEING CELEBRATED THERE BUT ALSO THE COURSE THEY PLAY ENGLAND ON MONDAY A THOUGHT AUSSIE ACCENT IS ICELAND'S AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.
AND IT'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY KIND OF TRANSLATION OF THAT SOUND OR IS IT JUST THE SOUND THE SAME SOUND THAT WE WERE IN THIS IS THAT I THINK THAT THE SONG THERE WOULD FORGIVE IN ONE EARTHLING ON AND FOR YOUR NATION I MEAN PLAINLY OR JUST A MASSIVE MASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT AND SOMETHING THAT WILL BE CELEBRATED PRESUMABLY BY VIRTUALLY EVERY ICELAND ABSOLUTELY I THINK THIS IS THE FANTASTIC RESULTS
THIS ISN'T SEIZED SORT US WHAT A TEAM CAN DO IT IN SPOT SORT OF IT'S AMAZING WAS THERE A SENSE WHEN THEY WENT THERE THAT THEY HAD IT IN THEM TO GET INTO THE LAST SIXTEEN
THEY HAVE ALSO THE VILLAGE DON'T BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES SO THEY HAVE A PROCESS EVERY EVERY GAME US THEY COULD THE WIND IT WITH IT WITH THAT OF THE MOST PLAYING AT ALL SO THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS HALL AND FEELING MY MOTHER WITH A MIRACLE MIGHT HAPPEN THAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S HAPPENING AND IT COULD GO FURTHER ACROSS ON MONDAY THEY MEET ENGLAND WHEN I RECKON ABOUT THAT
WELL IT WOULD BE EXCITING I THINK OVER ME AS A BUZZ OF THE LAST OF THE U.K. TOUR WITH A WITNESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH ENGLAND THAT UNTIL COURSE GAME WITH RESPECT AND TRIED TO AWAKEN THE ICELANDIC SPITTING OUR I DON'T BE TOO DIPLOMATIC THERE YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT THEM
WELL THEY'RE A POSSIBILITY AND SOME OF THE PLAYERS HAVE PLAYED IN THE ENGLISH LEAGUE SO THEY KNOW THEIR OPPONENTS SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO OH THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT ISN'T IT YOUR HANDPRINT PRESUMABLY I STANDARDS ANYWAY NO QUITE A LOT ABOUT ENGLISH FOOTBALL PRESUMABLY WHY WE RAISED WITH ENGLISH FOOTBALL SOUL YOU KNOW ALMOST ALL OF CITIES IN
IN ENGLAND WITHOUT FOOTBALL TEAMS THIS HAS BEEN YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YEAH A PREDICTION FOR THE RESULT AMBASSADOR THAT DATE SAY ONE ALL OR SOMETHING AND BE DIPLOMATIC ABOUT IT THE WORK WE CANNOT ACCEPT WORN OR DRAW BUT I WOULD BE OPTIMISTIC AND SAY ONE NIL FOR ICELAND
THOUGHT AS ACCENT I SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE U.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR SAM WELLS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING VOICES AT THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF SUGGESTED THAN EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE ABLE TO SELF CERTIFY SICKNESS FOR UP TO TWO WEEKS RATHER THAN ONE
THIS LOOKS LIKE A STORY ABOUT GROWING PRESSURES ON PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AND G.P.S DESIRE TO SPEND LESS TIME ON ROUTINE REQUESTS BUT THERE'S A DEEPER ISSUE INVOLVED THAN THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A QUESTION OF TRUST WHAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP TO THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER OR SUPERVISOR
DOES THE EMPLOYEE BELIEVE IN THE ORGANISATION AND REGARD THEMSELVES AS WELL TREATED SO THEY WOULDN'T IMAGINE CALLING IN SICK WITHOUT GOOD REASON DOES THE EMPLOYER RESPECT THE CHARACTER OF THEIR EMPLOYEE SUCH THAT THEY ARE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD IF NOT THE AREA OF SICKLY EVEN SICK PAY OR OFTEN AMONG THE FIRST PLACES TENSION SURFACES
G.P.S CAN EASILY GET DRAWN INTO A BATTLE BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER THAT'S NOT STRICTLY MUCH TO DO WITH HEALTH BUT EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WELL BEING AND TRUST
TO THRIVE IN A WORKING ENVIRONMENT YOU NEED TO BE FLUENT IN TWO LANGUAGES THE FIRST IS THAT OF CONTRACT A CONTRACT AS A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO FREE AGENTS THAT CREATES AN OBLIGATION THAT CAN BE ENFORCED CONTRACTS ARE A RESIDUE OF ACCUMULATED WISDOM SOMEONE'S THOUGHT IN ADVANCE ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG AND WORKED OUT A WAY OF NAMING RESPONSIBILITIES AND ANTICIPATING SOLUTIONS
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH CONTRACTS IS THAT THEY CAN SUBSIDE INTO A MINIMAL COMMITMENT ON BOTH SIDES THE EMPLOYER CAN TREAT THE EMPLOYEE POORLY AND HIDE BEHIND THE FACT THAT IT'S WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT
THE EMPLOYEE CAN SEE THERE ARE SEVEN PERMITTED SICK DAYS PER YEAR AND TREAT THEM LIKE UNOFFICIAL HOLIDAYS THAT'S WHY A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP GROWS INTO SOMETHING MORE SOMETHING CALLED A COVENANT
A COVENANT IS A LARGELY UNSPOKEN BOND OF TRUST AND LOVE BETWEEN PARTIES THAT REALISE HOW MUCH THEY DEEP AND ENRICH ONE ANOTHER THE BIBLE IS ALL ABOUT COVENANTS THE COVENANT OF LIFE WITH NOAH HAVE THE LAND WITH ABRAHAM OF THE LAW WITH MOSES OF THE LINEAGE WITH DAVID AND ULTIMATELY HER FORGIVENESS AND ETERNAL LIFE IN JESUS COVENANT IS THE BIBLE'S WORD FOR WHAT PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS IDENTIFY AS THEIR DEEPEST CONVICTIONS COMMITMENTS AND LOYALTIES
WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISMAYED BY ROGUE EMPLOYERS IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE EXPLOITING CONTRACTS WITH NO REGARD TO THE NOTION OF COVENANT THE SECRET IS TO ASPIRE FOR EVERY RELATIONSHIP TO BECOME A COVENANT BUT NEVER LET ANY RELATIONSHIP FALL BELOW THE LEVEL OF HER CONTRACT I BELIEVE WE CAN'T RUN OUR WHOLE LIVES BY CONTRACTS EVEN OUR WORKING LIVES
THE WORKPLACE FLOURISHES WHEN CONTRACT SLOWLY BUT SURELY TURNING TO COVENANTS TO ACHIEVE THAT AS EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYER MEANS LEARNING TO SPEAK BOTH LANGUAGES
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR SAM WELLS THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT OUT OF ONE NIGHTMARE INTO ANOTHER THAT IS THE DESCRIPTION ONE AID AGENCY HAS GIVEN US OF CONDITIONS IN IRAQI DISPLACEMENT CAMPS FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE ESCAPED FALLUJAH AFTER THE MILITARY OPERATION TO TAKE IT BACK FROM THE CONTROL OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THERE ARE STILL SOME IRE SITE AS INSIDE FALLUJAH AND THE CAMPS OUTSIDE ARE SAID TO BE OVERWHELMED BY AS MANY AS THIRTY THOUSAND NEW ARRIVALS IN THE LAST WEEK
ONE MAN FROM FOOTAGE WAS RECORDED BY THE NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL HIS WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY B.B.C. PRODUCER
SO THE FUN STELLA HER NOW IT HAS BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE WE CAME HERE I HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS AND THREE SONS GOOD PEOPLE ARE BRINGING FORWARD FOR US AS TO SHELTER WOMAN ASKED PEEPING ON THE BARE GROUND HERE A FAMILY OF SIX OR SEVEN I'LL GIVE HIM ONE BLANKET MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE FOR FIVE DAYS AND WE HAVE NO WATER ONLY ONE BLANKET SHARED BY SEVEN PERSONS
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO US LET THE UNITED NATIONS US LET THEM SEE WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH MY SADNESS YOU'RE SO WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO CULL SHH EMBRY FROM THE NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL WHO DESCRIBED WHAT THE CAPS ALIGHT
THE CONDITIONS ARE EXTREMELY DEYA THE REAPER LOOK WILL HAVE FLED FROM THE NIGHTMARE OF THE LORDS HAVE STABBED AND DO ANOTHER ONE THERE ARE LOTS OF BEEF I'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF CEREMONIES STILL OUT IN THE OPEN AND THERE ARE THESE SUN IT'S EXTREMELY HOT I WAS IN THAT PEOPLE EXHAUSTED A LOP SING ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE OBSCENE RETIRE THEM
CLEAN AND EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AGAINST UP FIFTY DEGREES IT WILL GET MORE THAN FIFTY DEGREES NEXT MONTH'S OVER HERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL FASTING FOR RAMADAN THERE'S WHITE ON THE HARDSHIPS AND THE DAGGERS MAKING THINGS EVEN WORSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF WATER AND FORWARDS MEDICINES THOSE ARE THE BIG PRIORITY I THOUGHT SAUL DANCE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL WITHOUT DANCE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE INSIDE THE DISPLACEMENT CAMPS
AND YET THIS MILITARY OPERATION WAS PLANNED FOR A LONG TIME AND WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS INSIDE FOR LU JAH THE HOPE WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET OUT ALIVE AND YET THEY'RE NOT BEING PROVIDED FOR ADEQUATELY
YES THIS IS DID TO GRADUALLY THEY GOT OUT ALIVE AND THEY CAME TO OUR SAFETY WE CANNOT PROVIDES FOR ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW AND THERE WE ARE RISKING THAT SOME OF THEM MIGHT EVEN DIE IF WE DON'T GET AIDS IMMEDIATELY THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE FACT THAT THE IRAQ EMERGENCY AND GERMAN AND EVEN BEFORE THE FINAL JOURNEY HAS BEEN SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED LES DON'T THEY'RE A DIVERSE SERVANTS OF THE NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE FOR EMERGENCIES HAS BEEN FUNDED
AND NOW WE'RE GOING ON THAT I DON'T KNOW COMMUNITY ON THE UNITED NATIONS GOT ANNOYED SO STOP OFF IN THE COORDINATION OF MECHANISM WITHIN THE CAMPS AND IT IS NOW A QUESTION OF LIFE OR DEATH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO THOSE YOU MEET IN THE CAMP'S ABOUT WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN FALLUJAH
DAVE'S REALLY EXPERIENCED HURL OVER THERE OR THERE OR THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR MONTHS ON AND UNDER SIEGE THEY THERE OR ITS ORES OF HARDSHIPS THEY'VE HAD TO EAT
AND IN A FREEDOM THAT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THAT THERE WERE MORE BASIC SUPPLIES GOING GEAR THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING FROM THE RIVER WATER WHICH IS UNDRINKABLE AND EVEN DRANK TO FLEE WAS DEFTLY FOR MANY OF THEM UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THEM DIDN'T MAKE IT I'M FOR MAGS THE MAGIC STORY OF HER GRANDMOTHER OR SOUGHT TO YOUR PROGRAMME IN THEIR OWN AND THE EUPHRATES RIVER AS DATA I'D CROSSING FOR SAFETY I FOR MAGS ARE YOU A LETTER
OF MY BETTER WHAT SHORT AND HER SHOULDER THE BULLET THEN HAD THREE GOODS AND MY HEAD'S GOING TO BE ON THE SPORTS THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL AND IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND SHAMEFUL THAT'S REEN NOW ABANDONED THEM AT THE VERY MOMENT WHERE THEY NEED US MOST WHAT WITNESSED ENGLISH ARSE FROM ISIS IF WE ABANDONED THEM NOW AND WHEN YOU SAY WE YOU MEAN AID AGENCIES SUCH AS YOUR CELLS THE UNITED NATIONS ALL THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT
I MEAN EVERYONE IF YOU WANT TO DOING COMMUNITY HAS PHILBY'S REBOOT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS FIGHTING GEYSERS HAVE WITH ALL THE RESOURCES AND FIGHTING BUT I'VE NOT HAD ONE FRACTION OF THAT MONEY IT'LL HOPING IN MEISSEN CIVILIANS EVERYONE WHO AVOID THROUGH THEM ONE WYLFA CAL REVISE AN IRAQI M.P. AND FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR I I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT CRITICISM AND WHETHER THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF FOCUS ON THE HUMANITARIAN FALL OUT FROM THE OPERATION ON SALUTE
BUT BECAUSE WHAT AID AGENCIES HAVE TOLD US IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF FALLUJAH HAVE WALKED OUT OF ONE NIGHTMARE INTO ANOTHER
HOW CLOSE HAS THE MILITARY OPERATION GOT TO FULLY REMOVING I.S. CONTROL OF THE LOO GER THEY'D THERE APPEAR TO BE STILL AREAS OF THE CITY AT THE MOMENT WHERE THEY HAVE CONTROL
ONCE THE OPERATION IS COMPLETE OVER AND THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAS FULL CONTROL OF WHAT DOES IT NEED TO DO TO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE DIVISIONS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THIS CITY NOT JUST IN THIS PERIOD BUT FOR YEARS GOING BACK TO WHEN THE AMERICANS WERE THERE

NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT FEARS ABOUT THE ZEKE OF OURS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LATIN AMERICA SEEKING ABORTIONS THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES HAVE ADVISED WOMEN NOT TO GET PREGNANT DUE TO THE RISK OF BABIES BEING BORN WITH TINY BRAINS IS A HEALTH REPORTER JAMES GALLO
TERMINATING A PREGNANCY IS ILLEGAL IN MANY PARTS OF LATIN AMERICA BUT WOMEN STILL HAVE THEM THROUGH ABORTION SERVICES LIKE WOMEN ON WEB WHICH ADVISES PEOPLE ONLINE AND THEN DELIVERS THE PILLS TO END A PREGNANCY SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ANALYSE DATA FROM THE WEBSITE TO SHOW DEMAND FOR ABORTIONS IN BRAZIL AND ECUADOR DOUBLED AFTER THE WARNINGS ON SEEKER
THE PREGNANT WOMEN SAID THEY WERE CONCERNED ALARMED AND DID NOT WANT A SICK BABY THE RESEARCHER SAID THE FIGURES WERE LIKELY TO BE AN UNDERESTIMATE AS MANY WOMEN WOULD CHOOSE A BACKSTREET OPTION AND THEY CRITICISE GOVERNMENTS FOR TELLING WOMEN TO DELAY HAVING CHILDREN WITHOUT OFFERING THEM ANY SOLUTIONS
A FORMER APPEAL COURT JUDGES TO LEAD AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO ALLEGATIONS THAT FOX CUBS WERE TAKEN TO THE KENNELS AT THE SOUTH HERITAGE JULIA HUNT TO TRAIN HER TO KILL THEM COVERT FOOTAGE PASSED TO THE B. B. SHOWS FOXES BEING CARRIED INTO THE KENNELS AND AFTERWARDS DEAD BODIES DUMPED IN A BIN THE COUNTRYSIDE ALLIANCE SAID IT WAS POTENTIAL ANIMAL CRUELTY AND NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGAL HUNTING HE'S TOM SIMONS
THE FOOTAGE WAS FILMED BY ACTIVISTS WHO INVESTIGATE HUNTING IT SHOWS YOUNG FOXES BEING TAKEN TO AND FROM A CAGE AT THE SOUTH HEREFORDSHIRE HUNT HEADQUARTERS LATER FOOTAGE APPEARS TO CAPTURE A MAN TAKEN TWO FOXES FROM THE CAGE AND INTO THE HUNT'S KENNELS SECONDS LATER FOOTAGE SHOWS FOX BODIES BEING PUT INTO A BIN THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS ON THE HUNT INVESTIGATION TEAM CLAIM IT WAS DONE TO TRAIN HUNTING HOUNDS TO ATTACK FOXES
TWO MEN AND ONE WOMAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND THE HUNTERS SUSPENDED A PAID MEMBER OF STAFF BUT WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER COMMENT TESCO HAS REPORTED A SECOND SUCCESSIVE QUARTER OF UNDERLYING SALES GROWTH IN THE U.K. THE FIRST TIME IT'S ACHIEVED THAT IN MORE THAN FIVE YEARS SALES GREW BY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS TO THE END OF MAY MORE DETAILS FROM DOMINIC O'CONNELL
A NOUGHT POINT THREE PER CENT SALES INCREASE MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH BUT A TESCO EVERY LITTLE REALLY DOES HELP IT'S THE CYCON CONSECUTIVE COURTROOM WHICH ITS U.K. SALES HAVE GROWN A SHARP REVERSAL FROM THE DARK DAYS OF RECENT YEARS WHEN SALES WERE PLUMMETING
AND TESCO SHARES TO THE SAME IT'S ALSO A SIGNED THE PLAN FROM DAVE LEWIS THE TESCO CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS STARTING TO WORK LOUIS ARE SOLD OFF BIG PARTS OF THE COMPANY AND TODAY HE DID IT AGAIN HARRISON HALL A COFFEE CHAIN BOUGHT BY HIS PREDECESSOR PHIL CLARKE IS BEING SOLD TO CAFE NERO
LOUIS WE BUOYED BY THE SALES NUMBERS BUT I MUST POINT OUT THAT THE INCREASE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY BIG PRICE CUTS IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY THE TEST GOES BACK TO FULL HEALTH JUST YET

THE CONSULTANT AT WANDSWORTH PRISON DOCTOR NIGEL BLACKWOOD HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT CUTS IN PRISON OFFICER NUMBERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A RISE IN SELF HARM AMONG PEOPLE IMPRISONED FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION I I.P. P. SENTENCES WHICH DO NOT HAVE A RELEASE DATE WE INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO KEEP SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN PRISON BUT WERE ABOLISHED FOR YEARS AGO
IN A REPORT PUBLISHED TODAY THE PRISON REFORM TRUST SAYS THE RATE OF SELF HARM AMONG THE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE STILL SERVING SUCH SENTENCES HAS RISEN BY FIFTY PER CENT DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS URGENTLY LOOKING AT THE ISSUE DOCTOR BLACKWOOD SAID WITHOUT A CLEAR END IN SIGHT THE PRISONERS HAD A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS
THEY SEEK HELP AND THEY SEEK A CLEAR TIME LINE THROUGH TO THEIR RELEASE WITH ACCESS TO THEIR PROGRAMMES AND I THINK THE MAJOR PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH AT THE MOMENT IS THE FOURTEEN THOUSAND REDUCTION AND PRISON OFFICERS AND ING LESS ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES AS A RESULT
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THREE QUARTERS OF GAME TRANSGENDER PEOPLE STILL FEEL UNDER PRESSURE TO LIE ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY OR GENDER IDENTITY THE SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT BY PRIDE IN LONDON THE GROUP THAT ORGANISES AN ANNUAL PARADE IN THE CAPITAL MORE DETAILS FROM CATRIONA RENTON

COMMUNITY WERE SURVEYED AND ASKED HOW THEY FELT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THEIR PRIVATE LIVES IN PUBLIC SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT SAID THEY STILL FELT THE NEED TO LIE ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY OR GENDER IDENTITY AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SAID THEY HAD COME OUT TO THEIR FRIENDS BUT ONLY FIFTY PERCENT WOULD TELL ALL OF THEIR COLLEAGUES
RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTED THAT PEOPLE FROM THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY ARE SIX TIMES LESS LIKELY TO HOLD THEIR PARTNER'S HAND IN PUBLIC AS WELL TWO PER CENT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION SAID THEY HAD BEEN BULLIED AT WORK BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER FIVE TIMES THAT NUMBER OF L.G.B.T. PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD BEEN THE PRIDE AND LONDON MAIN CELEBRATIONS TAPE PLAYS THIS WEEKEND WITH A PARADE THROUGH THE CITY CENTRE ON SATURDAY
TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS HAVE CAUSED WIDESPREAD FLOODING IN LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST THERE ARE REPORTS OF FLOODED STREETS ACROSS THE CAPITAL WITH ROADS UNDER SEVERAL INCHES OF WATER RED IMMEDIATE ACTION FLOOD WARNINGS HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR PARTS OF THE REGION THE TRANSPORT NETWORK HAS BEEN BADLY DISRUPTED

THE MAP USED BY J. R. R. TOLKIEN TO CREATE THEIR FANTASY WORLD MIDDLE EARTH FOR HIS EPIC NOVEL THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS GOING ON DISPLAY AT THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY IN OXFORD FOR ONE DAY ONLY IT WAS DRAWN BY TALKING SON CHRISTOPHER FOR THE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR EDITION AND ANNOTATED BY THE AUTHOR CHRIS FLETCHER IS KEEPER OF SPECIAL COLLECTIONS AT THE BODLEIAN HE SAYS THE MAP PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO TOLKIEN'S CREATIVE PROCESS
THERE ARE NEW THINGS ON THIS MAP HE'S REVISITING HIS FANTASY WORLD AND ADDING NEW THINGS I MEAN I LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT HE PUTS AND VERY FAINT PENCIL HOPPERTON IS ASSUMED TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE LATITUDE OF OXFORD NOW THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THOSE TWO PLACES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ASSOCIATED AND HE HAS A SCALE OF LATITUDE WHICH IS GOING TO HELP THE ARTIST POPULATE THEM UP WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOWERS AND ANIMALS
CONSERVATIONIST AT CHESTER'S BEGAN A BREEDING PROGRAMME TO TRY TO SAVE THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED MOUNTAIN CHICKEN FROG FROM EXTINCTION AND HIS SMALL NUMBER OF THE FROG'S REMAIN IN THE WILD ON THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF DOMINICA AND MONTSERRAT DOCTOR JERADO CAN SEE IT FROM THE ZOO SAYS THE BREEDING PROGRAMME ITSELF IS QUITE SIMPLE
WE HAVE FOUR PAIRS WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY SLATED IN A UNIT WE'RE NOBODY FI SHIPPING CONTAINER AND HOPEFULLY THAT FOUR PAIRS I GOING TO DO WHAT HE SHOULDN'T DO WOULD GENERALLY MIDSUMMER TIME'S SO HOT WE HAD THAT TO PUSH THE GENNED UP OPERATION DOCTOR JERADO GARCIA
THE TIME IS JUST GOING OUT TO TEN PAST EIGHT THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ENGLISH AND WELSH PRESENCE WHO HAVE NO FIRM RELEASE DATE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION I.P. PEAS WERE INTRODUCED BY LABOUR TO KEEP THE MOST SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN PRISON BUT THE SENTENCE WAS APPLIED FAR MORE WIDELY THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED IT BECAME SO DISCREDITED THE LAST GOVERNMENT ABOLISHED IT AND YET
THOSE FOUR THOUSAND REMAIN INSIDE WITH NO RELEASE DATE FIGURES OUT TODAY FROM THE PRISON REFORM TRUST SHOW THAT THE RATE OF SELF HARM AMONGST THIS GROUP IS ON THE RISE THERE WERE TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND INCIDENTS OF SELF HARM JUST LAST YEAR THREE WEEKS AGO THIS PROGRAMME HIGHLIGHTED THE CASE OF JAMES WARD HE GOT A TEN MONTH I.P. P. FOR ARSON
TEN YEARS LATER HE'S STILL INSIDE SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY OTHER PRISONERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WANT US TO TELL THEIR STORY AS CONWAY REPORTS
JUST PUT YOURSELF WHERE I AM I SPENT THIRTEEN YEARS AWAY FROM HOME I WENT INTO CARE AGED FOURTEEN FROM CARE TO PRISON AGED SIXTEEN AND NOW I'M TWENTY SEVEN ALL OF THAT TIME THEY'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION HOW WOULD YOU COPE
THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF ALAN LITTLER A PRISONER HE WROTE TO THE TODAY PROGRAMME A FEW DAYS AGO HIS LETTER IS BEING VOICED BY ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS I'VE HAD TO DO MY GROWING UP IN PRISON AND TO BE BLUNT I'M WELL AND TRULY INSTITUTIONALISED
HE WAS GIVEN FOUR YEARS FOR G.B.H. BUT HAS SPENT TEN YEARS IN PRISON HE'S ONE OF THOUSANDS OF INMATES SERVING WHAT'S CALLED AN I.P. P. IMPRISONMENT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION A MINIMUM SENTENCE WHICH HAS NO RELEASE DATE
OF LATE HE'S MADE QUITE A SEVERE CUT TO HIS NECK WHICH REQUIRED HOSPITALISATION SOLICITOR SHIRLEY NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT HOW MY CLIENT DANNY WHETHER SOME SELF HARMS IS ALSO
MADE QUITE SEVERE COACH TO HIS LEG AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD ACTUALLY BE HAVE ANY MOBILITY IN THE FUTURE
TO SEE THAT THE SELF HARM IS TO RELIEVE ANY HIS ANGST FRUSTRATION IT AT THAT BECAUSE OF THE STAGE YOU START WITH THIS
DANNY SELF HARMING BEHAVIOUR IS IN DANGER OF PREVENTING HIM FROM EVER BEING LET OUT HIS MOVED TO AN OPEN PRISON HAS JUST BEEN POSTPONED BECAUSE HE CUT HIS OWN THROAT
THE FEAR IS HE WON'T BE ABLE TO COPE IN OPEN CONDITIONS HE'S TRAPPED IN A VICIOUS CIRCLE I'M VERY WORRIED THAT THE SELF HARM WOULD END OF BEEN
YEAH THIS WAS THE MOMENT THAT SEAN LLOYD USED TO DREAM ABOUT IN PRISON HOLDING A BABY BOY IN HIS ARMS
NO YES YOU DO YES YOU DO
HE WAS GIVEN A TWO AND A HALF YEAR I P. P. FOR STREET ROBBERY WHEN HE WAS SEVENTEEN HE ENDED UP SERVING MORE THAN NINE YEARS HE GOT TO KNOW EIGHT I. P. P. PRISONERS WHO WOULD GO ON TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES ONE WAS A CLOSE FRIEND HE WAS A SELF HARMER INJURIES BUT HIS GLASSES ON
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO HIM WHY DO YOU THINK HE DID IT HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO NEVER HAD FAMILY THE YARD AND I PUKE LUCERNE TERMS AND WE USED TO TALK WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WERE GOING FOR MUM MY THING WAS TO KEEP TRYING AND YOU JUST GIVE UP
HE SAYS THE DELAYS IN GETTING RELEASED WERE IN LARGE PART DUE TO AN UNDER RESOURCED SYSTEM HE SAYS HIS LIBERTY WAS IN THE HANDS OF AN OVERWORKED OFFENDER MANAGER WHO WOULD RECOMMEND TO A PAROLE BOARD WHETHER HE SHOULD BE RELEASED MY OFFENDER MANAGER ARSON TWICE WITHIN
PROBABLY TWELVE TO FOURTEEN MONTHS SO CLEARLY NOBODY CAN KNOW YOU HAVE TO SEE ME TWICE TWO TIMES THEY SAW YOU FOR HOW LONG EACH TIME IT COULD BE ANYTHING FOR FIVE MINUTES FOR HALF AN HOUR THERE COULD BE TEN MINUTES
NEVER NEVER LONG SO AFTER TEN MINUTES MAKING A SET ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE STILL A RISK YOU KNOW AND A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE OFFENDER MANAGER THINKS HE'S NO THE OFFENDER MANAGER IS HE'S WHAT HE SAYS GOES
NOW ENJOYING HIS FREEDOM AND FATHERHOOD SEAN IS THINKING ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE
I WAS REPORTING I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY PETER DAWSON WHO IS A FORMER PRISON GOVERNOR NOW INCOMING DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON REFORM TRUST GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WELL WE THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE A MORE RADICAL APPROACH TO THIS YOU'VE HEARD THAT THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNIQUELY DISADVANTAGED IN THE SYSTEM
AND THOSE RATES OF SELF HARM ALTHOUGH SO HOME IS RISING ACROSS THE PRISON SYSTEM THEY ARE STARTLINGLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GROUPS OF PRISONERS INCLUDING OTHER PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES SO WE THINK THE TIME HAS COME TO CONVERT THOSE INDETERMINATE SENTENCES SENTENCES WITH NO END IN TO DETERMINATE SENTENCES WERE PEOPLE WILL KNOW THERE IS A DATE ON WHICH THEY WILL BE RELEASED AND THE SYSTEM MUST PLAN FOR THAT DATE AND WHAT WILL WORRY PEOPLE IS THAT MEANS QUITE A LOT OF POTENTIALLY QUITE DANGEROUS PEOPLE WILL BE LET OUT
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT NAIVE ABOUT THE OFFENCES THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE HAVE COMMITTEES NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THEM ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO POSE A RISK BUT THAT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM DEALS WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY BEFORE THIS SENTENCE AND AFTER THIS SENTENCE AND DURING THIS SENTENCE PEOPLE WERE GIVEN LONG DETERMINATE SENTENCES AND AT THE END OF THAT SENTENCE THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED
THE PRISON SERVICE THE POLICE WHAT IS NOW THE NATIONAL PROBATION SERVICE SPECIFICALLY CREATED TO DEAL WITH HIGH RISK OF HOME CASES HAVE TO DEAL WITH THOSE SITUATIONS AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC THAT RELEASED EVEN THOUGH THEY STILL DO PRESENT A RISK
TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ISN'T WHAT ITS HABIT JUST HAS TO ACCEPT WELL IT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS PROVIDED FOR THIS SENTENCE WAS AN ABERRATION WHAT WE DO IS WE SENTENCE PEOPLE BY THE NATURE OF THE OFFENCE BY THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE AND THE ONLY MAJOR EXCEPTION TO THAT IS PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED MURDER FOR EVERYTHING ELSE WE SO YOU MUST SERVE YOUR TIME IN RELATION TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT YOU DID AND WHEN IT COMES TO AN END YOU ARE ON LICENCE AND YOU'RE SUPERVISED THEN YOU CAN BE RECALLED TO PRISON
BUT WE DON'T SAY WE MIGHT KEEP YOU IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SURE IF THERE WASN'T A CHANGE AS BLUNT AS YOU'RE CALLING FOR HONOURS AND AS EXTREME AS YOU'RE CALLING FOR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE IN PRISONS OR IS THIS BUSINESS OF
RESOURCING AN IMPORTANT ONE IN YOUR VIEW BECAUSE WE HAD EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME WITH PRISON OFFICER CUT CUTS IN THEIR NUMBERS ARE PRISON OFFICERS WERE HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE WELFARE OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T THERE PEOPLE TO LOOK OVER THEM AND MANAGE THEM AND INDEED TO TO TELL PARABLES AT THEY WERE READY TO BE RELEASED THAT YES YES IT'S IMPORTANT AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PRISON SERVICES TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THIS THEY HAVE INVESTED IN IT AND THEY'RE DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE THROUGH QUICKER
THAT'S PAINFULLY SLOW AND YOU HEARD SOME STORIES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRACKED IN A SYSTEM WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO ROUND IN CIRCLES SO YES THEY NEED TO RESOURCE THE SYSTEM AS IT IS BUT THAT WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND HER SISTER STAYS IN THE TOO DIFFICULT TRAY THEN IT WILL GET WORSE BECAUSE PEOPLE BEING BITTER
AND WILL LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY LASH OUT AGAINST THE AUTHORITY MICHAEL GO FURTHER JUST SURGERY ASKED THAT CHAIRMAN OF THE PAROLE BOARD RECENTLY TO DEVELOP WHAT HE CALLED AN IMPROVED APPROACH TO EYE P.P. PRISONERS I MEAN CAN DID DO YOU SENSE THAT THERE IS AN AWARENESS IN GOVERNMENT OF WHAT IS GOING WRONG THERE'S CERTAINLY AN AWARENESS AND I THINK MICHAEL GO VIZ IS SEIZED OF THE DILEMMA THAT THESE PEOPLE FACE BUT IT ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT THE CHAIR OF THE PAROLE BOARD THAT CAN SOLVE THIS THE CHAIR OF THE PAROLE BOARD
CAN ONLY DEAL WITH WHAT COMES TO HIM HE'S NOT IN CHARGE OF HEALTH REPORTS HAVE PREPARED HE'S NOT IN CHARGE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM AND IF REPORTS COME TO HIM WHERE THE OFFENDER MANAGER HAD SEEN SOMEONE FOR A COUPLE OF TEN MINUTE SLOTS THEN OF COURSE THE PROBE ORDERS NOT IN A POSITION IS THAT REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT IT DOES HAPPEN THAT'S THAT THAT GUY'S NOT MAKING THAT UP
AND IT IT'S NOT FAIR IT WAS VERY JUST EXTRAORDINARY WHEN HE SAID IT I ASSUME THAT IT WAS SOME SORT OF ABERRATION IN HIS CASE THE OTHER LADS REGULARLY HAPPENING THERE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MIND BEING GIVEN THE CHANCE REALLY TO SUGGEST PROPERLY THAT THEY ARE READY TO BE OUTSIDE PRISON I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE SITUATION WOULD SAY THAT THEY ARE ASSESSED MULTIPLE TIMES BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT THERE'S NO CONTINUITY
AND IF THEY'RE IN PRISON FOR MAYBE NINE OR TEN YEARS INEVITABLY DURING THAT PERIOD TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INFLUENCE OVER THEIR RELEASE AND WHAT HAPPEN SOON CHANGES VERY REGULARLY AND UPHEAVALS IN THE PROBATION SERVICE MEAN THAT THAT IS PROBABLY HAPPENING MORE IN RECENT TIMES THAN BEFORE WHAT DOES ALL THIS TELL US MORE WIDELY ABOUT SENTENCING AND PRESENT THEN OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS PRESENT
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION I KNOW I THINK YOU COULD SAY I'M A GOOD REASON I ASK IS AS IT IS YOU CAN SEE WHY IT WAS INTRODUCED BY BUT THEN LABOUR GOVERNMENT THEY WANT TO BE THAT TO BE TOUGH TO PROTECT VICTIMS ET-CETERA AND WE ARE VERY KEEN TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND MY GOODNESS IF YOU ARE A VICTIM ME NO ONE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS BUT DID WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT THE BALANCE WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND FIGHT BUT IT WAS ABOLISHED AND I THINK IT WAS ABOLISHED BECAUSE PARLIAMENT UNDERSTOOD THAT IT HAD STEPPED OVER A LINE
AND THAT INDEFINITE IMPRISONMENT IS NOT A WAY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE THE ISSUES THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO A FRIEND AND THE SOLUTIONS TO OFFENDING LIE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY DON'T LIE IN PRISON
INCOMING DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON FROM CROSS FORMER PRISON GOVERNOR YOURSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT ONE MORNING IN DECEMBER NINETEEN SEVENTY AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR TURNED UP AT THE NIXON WHITE HOUSE IT WAS ELVIS PRESLEY BEARING A NOTE REQUESTING SOME FACE TIME WITH THE PRESIDENT THE SUBSEQUENT MEETING BETWEEN ELVIS AND NIXON WAS CAPTURED FIRST IN A PHOTOGRAPH WHICH IS THE U.S. NATIONAL ARCHIVES MOST REQUESTED DOCUMENT AND NOW IN A FILM OUT TOMORROW
IN THE OVAL OFFICE WAS ANOTHER MAN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL BOD CROW LATER JAILED FOR HIS ROLE IN THE WATERGATE SCANDAL HE'S NOW BASED AT THE SCHOOL FOR ESSEX AND GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON AND HE'S BEEN TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE DAY THE PRESIDENT MET THE KING YOU'LL HEAR HIS VOICE AFTER A CLIP FROM ELVIS AND NIXON WITH KEVIN SPACEY AS THEIR PRESIDENT
FROM ELEVEN FORTY TWO TWELVE OH FIVE YOU THE MEANING THE GRAND ALTAR RECEIVED AT THE MANOR CREDENTIALS FROM INVESTORS OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND ZAMBIA THEY SPEAK ANY ENGLISH I BELIEVE SO GOOD I HATE IT WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN TRY
FROM TRAVEL FIVE TO ONE OF FIVE YOU HAVE YOU OPEN OUR AT THE END OF WHICH WAS I WOULD BE A GOOD TIME EVERY MINUTE WITH MY PRESSIE FROM ONE TEN TO ONE THIRTY YOU HAVE
ELVIS PRESLEY YES SIR THE ENTERTAINER OH I KNOW WAS PRESSED LEO'S
BUT WHEN I GOT THE LETTER THERE HAD WRITTEN IN LONGHAND GLORY I WAS ON THE PLANE FLYING BACK TO WASHINGTON D.C.
REALLY SINCERE BUT NO I HAD A TEST THOUGH SINCE EARLY MY MEETING WITH TWO ELVISES STAFF TO TRY AND CONFIRM IT WAS A SERIOUS REQUIRES AND SO IT WAS AND THE MEETING DULY TOOK PLACE WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT
I REMEMBER HAVING TO GO OVER AND JOE ELVIS THEN HE COULD NOT TAKE INTO YOUR WHO OFFERS I'VE GONE
HE BROUGHT A GUN TO THE WHITE HOUSE WHY BECAUSE ELLA'S ONE HE JUST GIVE A KNIFE'S
THE NEXT WE WERE JAS A COLT FORTY FIVE AUTOMATIC PISTOL IN A DISPLAY CASE WITH BULLETS
AND WHEN I EXPLAIN THEIR GUNS ARE FROWNED UPON AROUND HERE I'M NOT SURE THAT HE COMPLETELY GALA
WAS HE COMING TO SEE THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE WAS AN ADMIRER OF HIM POLITICALLY I WOULD SAY AND ONE MEASURE YES HE WANTED TO HELP WITH THE DRUG ISSUE
ELGAR'S WESLEY WANTED TO HELP THE ADMINISTRATION WITH DRUGS WELL WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THE VERB HELP THERE MICHELLE
I MEAN HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO USE HIS STARE AT YOU OWN
THINK URGE YOUNG PEOPLE THIS AWFUL DRUGS
AND PEOPLE SAY I WAS ABUSED THEM HAVE HIMSELF WHAT HE ABUSED HER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS I'M NOT JUSTIFYING IT WHERE IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING
WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT'S ATTITUDE TO ELVIS WITH THIS IS ELVIS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS FAME ANSWER ANNEXING NEXT
SO HOW DID IT GO WHAT DID THEY SAY TO EACH OTHER WELL IT TURNED OUT THAT ELVIS REALLY WANTED WAS TO GET HER VEG
FROM THE BURE AMERICA ALEX AND DANGEROUS DRUGS I ASKED THE PRESENT I SAID SURE YOU WANT HIM WHEN HE SAID YES I DO ELVIS WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH THEIR HE GRABBED THE PRESIDENT AND GAVE UP
IN THE LETTER THAT ELVIS HAD WRITTEN TO PRESIDENT NIXON HE SAID HE WANTED TO COME AND SEE HIM BECAUSE HE HAD DONE AN IN DEPTH STUDY OF COMMUNIST BRAINWASHING TECHNIQUES YES NOW AS ONE OF US I DIDN'T SEE COMING
SO SOMETHING LIKE OR KEEPS THAT UP WE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE COME COMMUNIST BRAINWASHING
WOULD YOU SAY HIS POLITICS WERE PRETTY CONSERVATIVE OR CERTAINLY MUCH MORE SAY THAN PEOPLE WHO WOULD KNOW HIM MIGHT IMAGINE OH YES I WOULD SAY ELVIS WAS PRETTY CONSERVATIVE YOU KNOW THIS IS A GUY WHO COULD HAVE AVOIDED SERVING IN THE MILITARY
BUT ANYWAY YOU KNOW I WAS ASSIGNED TO DUTY IN GERMANY WHERE HE WAS FOR A FEW YEARS IN THE U.S.
DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS STAR STRUCK DID HE ENJOY THE BRUSH WITH CELEBRITY I DON'T THINK HE WAS DARTS THROW
I THINK IT TOOK HIM A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT WHY IS THIS MAN THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW
BUT THEN YOU KNOW HE REALISED LATER BLOODED TARKA IN THAT ELVIS HAD COME UP THE HARD WAY AND HE RECOGNISED IN ELVERS THEIR CROWN THE DRIVE
AND AMBITION TO GET TO THE TOP OF HIS PROFESSION HE NEXT EXPRESS CAN GET TO THE TOP OF APOLLO

IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S SUCH A BIG ADJUSTMENT FOR ALL THE PLAYERS COMING OFF THE CLAY COURTS THE FRENCH OPEN JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY COME OUT THEY MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THE MOVEMENT IS VERY DIFFERENT THE BALL BOUNCES VERY DIFFERENT ON A GRASS COURT I THINK THE BODY FEELS DIFFERENT AFTERWARDS THEY GET DIFFERENT ACHES AND PAINS
AND OF COURSE THE POINT CONSTRUCTION IT'S MUCH QUICKER AND FASTER YOU GET QUICKER FOR YOU POINTS ON ACROSS THIS HUGE HUGE ADJUSTMENTS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE PLAYERS PLAY
A DIFFERENT GRASS DROPPED ON IT BEFORE WIMBLEDON LAST HOUR WE HAD FOR THE BRITISH NUMBER ONE YOU'RE A CONCERT HE BEAT THE DOUBLE WIMBLEDON CHAMPION PATRICK A BIT OF A HAIR ACTUALLY SEEDED AT WIMBLEDON HOW SIGNIFICANT IS ALL OF THIS FOR BRITISH WOMEN'S TENNIS OH IT WAS A HUGE HUGE WHEN YESTERDAY A VERY VERY SPECIAL PERFORMANCE AND SO I MEAN NOT ONLY WAS SHE OUTSTANDING IN HOW SHE PLAYED THE GAME BUT SHE'D BEEN UP IN THAT FIRST SET BY FIVE GAMES TO TWO ENDS UP LOSING IT
I THOUGHT SHE WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE MENTALLY HOW STRONG SHE WAS TO COME BACK FROM THAT REALLY COMPETE WITH HER ON A MENTAL CAPACITY AS WELL AS WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO DO OUT THERE TACTICALLY AND THEN SHE EXECUTED ON EVERYTHING I MEAN THE WHOLE PACKAGE THAT SHE BROUGHT IN WAS HUGE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE CONFIDENCE BOOST GOING INTO A LYNN HAVING BEATEN A TUE TIME WIMBLEDON CHAMPION AS YOU SAY NO A SLIGHTLY FITMENTS QUESTIONS BUT SKIRTS HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A CONTROVERSY IN TENNIS OVER THE YEARS
THIS TIME WE'VE GOT THEM COMING UP AND BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF SOME OF THE SKIRTS THE COMING OF A BETTER WAY SO THEY'RE FLAT OUT YES EXACTLY YES WHICH IS SIMPLY MANUFACTURE INTO A BIT OF A FLAP YEAH I'VE HAD A LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THE DRESS AND I MUST ADMIT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IF I WAS MADE TO WEAR THAT I HE WOULD HAVE TO GET THE SAFETY PINS OUT AND IT ALL BACK TOGETHER I MEAN TENNIS PLAYERS ARE USED TO THEIR SKIRTS FLAPPING UP IN THE BREEZE YOU KNOW YOU SEE THEY'RE SHORTS UNDERNEATH CONSTANTLY THEY USED TO

YEATS WHO PRODUCES COMPLETE WORKS AND HIS REPUTATION HAS FLOURISHED SINCE THAT SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE WITH JONATHAN BATE SERRA HEGARTY AND JOHN ME AND NOW BACK TO JUSTIN FRONT TODAY
THANKS LOOK AT THE WEATHER MOSTLY DRY ACTUALLY TODAY HEAVY SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH EAST AND NORTH WEST PARTICULARLY LATER THOSE HEAVY SHOWERS WE SAW OVERNIGHT RETURNING YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND FOR CHARLES WHO SAYING TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE ZEB SOAMES HAS A SUMMARY FROM WHO'S VOTING IS TAKING PLACE IN A REFERENDUM TO DECIDE WHETHER TO KINGDOM SHOULD REMAIN PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR LEAVE IT MORE THAN FORTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE ELIGIBLE TO TAKE PART IN WHAT IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLE FOR DECADES
DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE STAGING A PROTEST IN CONGRESS TO PRESS THEIR DEMANDS FOR TIGHTER GUN CONTROLS THEY WANT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO REMAIN IN SESSION DURING NEXT WEEK'S SCHEDULE RECESS IN ORDER TO VOTE OR GUN LEGISLATION
THE PRISON REFORM TRUST SAYS THE FOUR THOUSAND INMATES IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHO ARE SERVING PUBLIC PROTECTION SENTENCES WITH NO RELEASE DATE HAD BEING DRIVEN BY DESPAIR TO HIGH LEVELS OF SELF HARM THE I.P. P. SENTENCES WERE CREATED TO KEEP SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEXUAL OFFENDERS IN PRISON BUT WERE ABOLISHED FOUR YEARS AGO THE DIRECTOR OF THE PRISON REFORM TRUST PETER DAWSON TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT ALL REMAINING PRISONERS ON SUCH SENTENCES SHOULD HAVE THEM CONVERTED INTO ONES WITH THE RELEASE DATE
NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT FEARS ABOUT THE ZEKE A VIRUS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LATIN AMERICA WANTING ABORTIONS THE RISE TOOK PLACE DESPITE THE FACT THAT ABORTION IS ILLEGAL OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN MUCH OF THE REGION
BANK IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WHEN YOU HEAR THE VOICE OF ANY BUTLER'S GRANDFATHER TELLING US THAT HE PLEADED WITH THE COURT TO LET THE LITTLE GIRL STAY WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE TELLING US HE WASN'T LISTEN TO RECOUNTING THEIR LAST MEETING BEFORE HER FATHER KILLED HER IT CHILLS THE BLOOD AND IT'S A STORY OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE BY THE COURTS TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT
AND YET THERE IS OF COURSE MORE TO IT WHY FOR INSTANCE DID ELLY'S MOTHER JENNY GRAY WHO WAS HERSELF IN PRISON FOR COVERING UP THE MURDER WHY DID SHE STAY WITH BEN BUTLER WHEN HE WAS VIOLENT AND CRUEL AND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONVICTED OF HURTING ELLIE CONVICTION OVERTURNED ON APPEAL DOCTOR JANE MONCKTON SMITH AS A CRIMINOLOGIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF GLOUCESTERSHIRE WHO REVIEWS DOMESTIC HOMICIDE CASES FOR THE HOME OFFICE
TRAINS THE POLICE ON HOW TO SPOT I THINK OR COERCIVE CONTROL GOOD MORNING TO YOU FOR DOCTOR MONK AND SMITH GOOD MORNING AND COULD COERCE HER CONTROL IS IS A THING IS THEY DID SOMETHING THAT YOU LOOK FOR AND RECOGNISED
ABSOLUTELY IT'S SO ACKNOWLEDGE NOW TO BE VERY DANGEROUS THAT WE WE HAVE IT CRIMINALISED SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN IT HAS BEEN A CRIMINAL PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR AND HE'S HIT THAT THAT THE CRIMINAL PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR WHICH WAS GIVEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY WHEN WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THE CRIMINAL PATTERN IS THE SAME IS IT AS THE THINGS THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNISED BY THE CRIMINAL LAW EITHER COS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN REPORTED UP WITH US PEOPLE HAVEN'T NOTICED
IT'S COERCIVE CONTROL IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS VERY EASY TO SPOT IT'S OFTEN HIDDEN SOMETIMES IT'S NOT HIDDEN THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DOMESTIC ABUSE WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS WE'RE LOOKING FOR VIOLENCE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER SIGNS OF CONTROL CAN SEEM TRIVIAL LIKE WHAT
WELL THINGS LIKE WHETHER THE PERSON REALLY I SUPPOSE BASICALLY HAS THE CHOICE TO LEAVE IN COURSE OF CONTROL SITUATIONS MOST CHOICES ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE VICTIM THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE TO GO OUT THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE THE CHOICE OF WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO EAT FOR EXAMPLE STOWED THE CHOICE TO LEAVE IS VERY OFTEN JUST TAKEN AWAY
AND YOU TRAIN THE POLICE I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS CASE AND THE MISTAKE THAT WAS MADE BY THE FAMILY COURT COULD MAYBE THE JUDGES NEED TO BE TRAINED AS WELL
I DO BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT THE WHOLE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE COERCIVE CONTROL WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY HOW VERY DANGEROUS IT IS AND WE KNOW THAT IT PREDICTS HOMICIDE NINE TIMES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN VIOLENCE ON ITS OWN SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL EVERYBODY CAN RECOGNISE IT
AND IN THIS CASE WE KNOW DON'T WE THAT JENNY GRAY WHO INCIDENTALLY IS BLAMED AT LEAST IN PART BY HER OWN FATHER FOR WHAT HAPPENED SHE'S NOT ABSOLVED OF BLAMED BYE BYE HEN BUT
BUT SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO A KIND OF CONSTANT ABUSE AND TEXT MESSAGES AND THE REST
HER LIFE AND ELLIE'S LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY IT AND NEED SOME CHANGING EMOTIONS OF BEN BUTLER AND THAT WOULD HAVE MEANT IT WAS A LIFE OF DREAD AND FEAR OF WALKING ON EGGSHELLS AND I I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
AT SOME LEVEL JENNY GRAY PROBABLY THOUGHT SHE WAS MANAGING THE SITUATION AND OBVIOUSLY CONVINCING TO THE COURT BECAUSE THAT'S THE OTHER EXTRAORDINARY THING MISSUS JUSTICE HAUNTED THE JUDGE WHO SENT HER BACK TO HER PARENTS ARE LITTLE ELLIE BACK TO HER PARENTS TO SCRIBED BUTLER AS THOUGHTFUL AND IMPRESSIVE I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A LEVEL OF IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE WOMAN IN THIS CASE WAS WAS ABUSE THE ENTIRE COURT SYSTEM WAS WASN'T IT
WELL ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER HERE IS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY MANIPULATIVE THEY HAVE TO BE MANIPULATIVE THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND THEIR NEEDS AND WANTS AND EMOTIONS DEPEND ON IT AND THEY LEARN TO BE MANIPULATIVE DO YOU THINK THAT'S A LESSON THAT FAMILY COURT JUDGES OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT NOW
MOST DEFINITELY THERE ARE THERE ARE SIGNS THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN LOOK FOR THERE ARE HIGH RISK FACTORS THAT COME UP IN A LOT OF THESE CASES THAT THE FAMILY COURTS AND THE CRIMINAL COURTS SHOULD BE VERY AWARE
EMINENT IN THE LONGER TERM DIG THE ARE WE GETTING IT I MEAN THIS WAS IN AN APPALLING CASE AND JUST HORRIFYING TO TO HERE AND WHEN WE TALKED TO TWO FELIS GRANDFATHER YESTERDAY WAS IT WAS JUST SO UPSETTING
BUT IN THE LONGER TERM ARE WE BEGINNING TO NOTICE AS WITH THE CRIMINALISATION OF THIS CONTROL OF COERCIVE CONTROL ARE WE BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN ORDER TO GET THESE THINGS RIGHT I THINK THAT WE ARE I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENING WHICH ARE IMPROVING THE SITUATION FOR PROFESSIONALS AND FOR VICTIMS TO REMEMBER IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PROFESSIONALS TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF THING AS WELL WE HAVE A NEW LAW
WE HAVE FOR THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE CHANGED TO INCLUDE COERCION AND CONTROL THERE'S LOTS OF TRAINING FOR POLICE ESPECIALLY GOING ON AT THE MOMENT TO HELP THEM TRY AND RECOGNISED COERCIVE CONTROLLING BEHAVIOURS AND WE HAVE RISK IDENTIFICATION CHECKLISTS WHICH HELP AH SEE QUITE CLEARLY WHAT THE VERY HIGH RISK MARCUS OFF DOCTOR JANE MONCKTON'S FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE WOMEN IN THE KITCHEN WOMEN DOING THE LAUNDRY WOMEN IN BIKINIS MIGHT WE HAVE FEWER OF THESE SORTS OF IMAGES IN ADVERTISING AFTER THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS GIANT UNILEVER DECIDED THAT IT WOULD AVOID USING SEXES STEREOTYPES TO SELL ITS PRODUCTS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR ITS NOR STOCK CUBES FOR EXAMPLE NOW REPLACES A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER COOKING TOGETHER WITH A FATHER AND SON HERE'S HOW KEITH WE'D UNILEVER AS CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER EXPLAIN THE CHANGE
IT'S NOT JUST A MORE QUESTION THIS IS ECONOMIC QUESTION WE'VE SHOWN THAT THE ADVERTISING THAT'S MORE PROGRESSIVE AS GREATER IMPACT HAS GREATER ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT AND AS ADVERTISING SUCH A POWERFUL TOOL THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN BOTH BUILD UP BUT ALSO LEAD TO POSITIVE CHANGE ADVANCE THE AGENDA ALARM ADVERTISED
WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY SARAH TODD FOR U.K. C.E.O. OF GEOMETRY GLOBAL A MARKETING AGENCY AND BY CAITLIN RYAN WHO'S EXECUTIVE CREATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ADVERTISING AGENCY JAIL GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH KATE AND RYAN DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THINGS A BECAUSE UNILEVER IS SUCH A MASSIVE ADVERTISING ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE WORLD
YEAH I THINK THE INDUSTRY IS HE'S TAKING THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY HOW WOMEN ARE BETRAYED IN ADVERTISING A MEANT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT AND I THINK THAT THE WAY WOMEN A SCENE IN ADVERTISING NEEDS TO CHANGE AND IS CHANGING AND THEY QUITE USEFUL THAT THE STEREOTYPES WHEN YOU'VE GOT A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN WHAT IS IT THIRTY SECONDS FOR THE AVERAGE TELEVISION
COMMERCIAL USEFUL TO TELL A STORY QUICKLY YEAH I THINK THAT IS WHY STEREOTYPES ARE SO OFTEN USED BECAUSE WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY AND AS YOU SAY IN A VERY FAST FORMAT NINETY SECONDS AT THE MOST USUALLY THIRTY SECONDS AND WE LIVE IN A VERY VISUAL AGE SO STEREOTYPES AND CLICHES HAVE BEEN USED TO GET MESSAGES ACROSS VERY QUICKLY AT SOTO PRESUMABLY UNILEVER ARE MAKING ARE ASSUMING THAT THIS IS A SOLID BUSINESS DECISION THAT IT IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR SALES
I THINK THE WAY WE LIVE TODAY THE WAY WOMEN'S ROLE IN SOCIETY IS IS REALLY DIVERSE SO I DON'T RUSH HOME OF AN EVENING AND START WHIPPING UP A LASAGNE FOR MY FAMILY AND KIDS YOU KNOW AND MANY WOMEN ARE THE SAME AS ME WE WE JUGGLE THINGS MEN THE SAME AND I THINK THE FOCUS
THAT KEITH HAS TALKED ABOUT FROM UNILEVER IS HIS HOLY RELEVANT TO HOW WE LIVE TODAY AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS WE MAKE CHOICES WE IDENTIFY WITH BRENT BRANDS THAT IDENTIFY WITH US THAT THEIR SALES WEREN'T DOING BADLY FROM THE OLD STYLE OF ADS WERE THOUGH I THINK WHAT
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS REALLY THROWN DOWN THE GAUNTLET TO THE INDUSTRY AND THEY'VE SAID WE STAND FOR CHANGE AND I THINK THEIR COMPETITION WILL PRICK VARIOUS UP QUITE RIGHTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THAT AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT THEY WANT TO STAND OUT THEY WANT TO BROADEN THEIR APPEAL AND ULTIMATELY THEY WANT TO BE RELEVANT AND PROGRESSIVE AND SHOW HOW THEIR BRANDS CAN BE HEATHER ARE RELEVANT ROLE TODAY IN CUSTOMERS' LIVES KATE'LL IS IT EASY TO DO WITH SOME
BRANDS RATHER THAN OTHERS AND I'M THINKING PARTICULARLY OF SOMETHING LIKE WASHING POWDER ARE GENERALLY YOU ALWAYS SEE THE WOMAN LOADING THE WASHING MACHINE CHOOSING THE POWDER DEALING WITH THE CHILDREN STAINED CLOTHES I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S FAIRLY STANDARD ISN'T IT IS THAT REALLY GOING TO CHANGE YEAH I THINK IT CAN I THINK AS SARAH SAID THAT WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD CULTURE IS CHANGING AND UM YOU KNOW
IN MY HOUSEHOLD MY HUSBAND DOES MUCH MORE WASHING THAN I DO SO JUST RELYING ON THOSE VERY SORT OF THIN CHARACTERISTICS ALL OF STEREOTYPES I THINK WILL AND MIX CREATIVELY AND THEIR WORK MORE INTERESTING TO BE MORE NUANCED BUT IT IS MOSTLY THE WOMEN DOING THE BUYING ISN'T IT OFF THERE OF THINGS LIKE THE HOUSEHOLD PRICE OF WOMEN DOING THE SUPERMARKET SHOPS IF YOU DO YOU THINK A WOMAN IS MORE LIKELY TO BUY WASHING POWDER WHICH SHE HAS SEEN ADVERTISED WITH WITH A MAN LOADING THE WASHING MACHINE
IT'S TRUE THAT WOMEN ARE MAKING ROUGHLY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE DECISIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD SHOP AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MENTAL SHORT CUTS YOU MAKE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY IN A STORE OR BUYING ONLINE AND IN CHOPPING MADE THERE SINCE YOUR OVERALL ATTACHMENTS WERE BRANDON BROWN CONSIDERATION I THINK
THAT THE POINT HE'S MAKING IS THAT WOMEN AND MEN THINK ABOUT THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR HOLISTIC SENSE ALL THEIR LIFESTYLE AND MYSTIC SENSE AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTATIVES OF OF SOCIETY AND NOT JUST OF MEN AND WOMEN BIT OF OTHER DIVERSITY OF AGE OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS AS WELL SO I THINK WE WE CAN'T CREATE COMMUNICATIONS AREN'T RELEVANT RELEVANT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT I THINK THAT'S THE BIG POINT THEY'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNS YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CAITLYN WHERE YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE USED HER A PRETTY SORT OF
STANDARD SEXIST IMAGE AND YOU HAVEN'T FELT GOOD ABOUT IT KNOWN THAT IT'S WHAT THE CLIENT WANTS OR WHAT'S GOING TO WORK YEAH I MEAN THAT DEFINITELY COME OVER THERE
TWENTY YEARS' INDUSTRY A CAREER IT GOT TO A POINT ABOUT FIVE SIX YEARS AGO WHERE I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PATROL OF WOMEN IN ADVERTISING I LOOKED BACK AT HOW WOMEN HAD BEEN USED IN IN ADVERTISING THEM IN THE EYE AND MY OWN WORK THERE ARE CREDIT LIKE THAT I HAVE RELIED YOU KNOW BEEN LAZY WITH WITH STEREOTYPES AND
WORKING A LOT ON THE INDUSTRY AND IN OUR OWN WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT WHAT WOULD YOU NOT DO NOW THAT YOU DID IN THE PAST I THINK IT IS LEE RELYING ON THAT SORT OF LAZY STEREOTYPES AND BEING MORE INTERESTING A NUANCED IN UM IN THE WAY WE CAST AMEN THE SETTINGS IN THE WAY WE WRITE THE CHARACTERS INTO THE INTO THE ADVERTISING SERAIT I'M THINKING ABOUT CAMPAIGNS WHICH GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR USING REAL REAL WOMEN REAL PEOPLE DOVE SO FOR EXAMPLE
MARKS AND SPENCER AS WELL WHAT WERE THEY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF SALES UNILEVER AND DOVE HAVE BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT CAMPAIGN IS THEY'VE KEPT IT GOING SO THEY THEY REPRESENT REAL WOMEN BUT THEY'VE ALSO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ON TO TALK ABOUT SELF ESTEEM AND AS A MUM
DAUGHTER NOT FAR OFF PUBERTY I FIND THAT INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AROUND SAY FIT HAVING THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE WELCOMING PEOPLE SELF EXPRESSION AND WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUSING ENTIRELY ON ON APPEARANCE BUT WE'RE THINKING IN A MUCH MORE ROUNDED WAY
I THINK THAT BRANDE PLATFORM CAN CONTINUE TO BE RELEVANT BECAUSE IT'S CHAMPIONING THINGS PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE VALUES OF THEIR PARENTS BUT IT'S A VALLEYS OF OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND WHAT THEY REALLY WANT IT THINK THINKING ABOUT THE EMPHASIS ON APPEARANCE OF KATE AND ANIMAL ALWAYS STRUCK AND I'M IN SOUTH ASIA SEEING ADVERTS FOR THE FOR SOAP AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT INVARIABLY IT'S A VERY PALE SKINNED PERSON WHO PETER GENERALLY BEARS LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO SOMEONE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ON THE STREET SELLING THAT PRODUCT
I THINK GLOBAL BRANDS ARE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF CREATING ASSETS THAT WORK GLOBALLY IS THIS ALMOST CENTRALISATION OF THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ETHIC KEN CAN WORK AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK LOTS OF LOCAL MARKETS ARE TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO DO THAT AND TO HAVE LOCAL INSIGHTS AT THE WORK BECOMES MORE RELEVANT CULTURALLY TO THAT MARKET PLACE KATE AND RYAN AND SARAH TODD THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS QUARTER TO NINE EARLIER THIS WEEK WE PLAYED YOU PART OF RADIO COMEDIES FOOTBALL COMMENTARY IN WELSH OF WALES PLAYING RUSSIAN TODAY WE HEARD SOME EXUBERANT COVERAGE OF ICELAND'S LATER SKATES IN THE SAME SPIRIT WE THOUGHT WE'D SHARE THIS COMMENTARY FROM A PORTUGUESE RADIO STATION DURING THEIR GAME AGAINST HUNGARY YESTERDAY WHAT
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A HABIT OF IT LET'S DO IT NOW AND LINEKER IT IS THERE FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CONFLICTS OF CONFLICTS THAT CAUSED A HUGE MEASURE IN DAMAGE AS WELL IS ABOUT IT SEEMS TO COME TO AN END THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FUCK REBELS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'VE REACHED IN HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO PUT TO END FIFTY TWO YEARS
OF FIGHTING ON THURSDAY THE CLUMP HIM PRESIDENT ONE MANUAL SANTOS WILL JOIN THE LEADER OF FAR TOO MANY ON HUMAN HEIRS IN HAVANA WHERE THEY'LL GIVE DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT TO BE BE SEAS WILL GRANT HAS HAD RARE ACCESS TO ONE OF THE FOX CAMPS IN WESTERN COLOMBIA TO MEET SOME OF THE FIGHTERS WHO SEEM TO BE ON THE BRINK OF PEACE
OUR INSTRUCTIONS WERE DIRECT AND TO THE POINT TAKE A BOAT TO A SPECIFIC VILLAGE ON THE NILE RIVER AND AWAIT FURTHER CONTACT THE ORGANISATION WE WERE DUE TO MEET HER USED TO KEEPING THEIR COMMUNICATION
FOR FIVE DECADES THE FARQUHAR TRIED TO STAY UNDER THE RADAR OF THE STATE AS THEY WAGED THEIR CAREER IN A WAR IN THE JUNGLES OF COLOMBIA
THE BOAT YOU'LL BE MET BY A GROUP OF GORILLAS STRETCHED WITH AND SIXTEENTH WE'RE NEEDING US
PRETTY TREACHEROUS
THE FOLK WERE TAKING US TO A HIDDEN CAMP OF THEIR THIRTIETH
A LONG HISTORY OF KIDNAPPING AND CLOSE LINKS TO DRUG TRAFFICKING AND MARKS HIS REBEL ARMY IS NOW ON THE BRINK OF LAYING DOWN THEIR ARMS AFTER THREE YEARS OF PEACE TALKS IN HAVANA
SO YOU'VE ARRIVED WHAT IS A VERY WELL HIDDEN CAMP WE'RE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE CANOPY OF THE JUNGLE
STICK THE ROOFING HAS BEEN COVERED WITH PALM FRONDS TO HIRE FROM THE FLY HELICOPTERS THESE DAYS THE ONLY TIME THE THIRTIETH CRUNCHED USED THEIR WEAPONS IS WHEN THEY BREAK THEM DOWN TO CLEAN THEM
CAMILLE THE GORILLA TASKED WITH LOOKING AFTER US HAS BEEN PART OF THE FOX SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER AND AT TWENTY SEVEN IS NOW CONSIDERED A VETERAN I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS READY TO PUT DOWN HIS GUN
ELEVEN MY HIPS IF ANYTHING TO COME WHEN I WOULD MAYBE YOUR WEAPON BECOMES LIKE A WAY OF LIFE WITHOUT YOUR GUN YOU FEEL EMPTY OR NAKED BECAUSE YOU'RE USED TO CARRYING IT ON YOUR SHOULDERS SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL CONSTANTLY READY FOR WAR BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY WE PREPARED FOR PEACE AND FOR POLITICS
LIKE MANY OTHER FIGHTERS HIS AGE ALL CAMILLO HAS KNOWN HIS ENTIRE ADULT LIFE IS
AFTER TEN YEARS HE'S AN EXPLOSIVES EXPERT FOR THE NET BETWEEN INSURGENTS WHAT DOES HE HOPE TO DO ONCE A PEACE DEAL IS FINALLY
I WILL STAY WITHIN THE NORMS OF THE FOG AND GO WHERE THEY TELL ME THEY NEED ME REPRESENTING THEM TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES IF THE SITUATION ARISES BUT I HAVE TO CHOOSE A CAREER OUTSIDE OF THE FOG THEN I'D LIKE TO BE A CIVIL ENGINEER THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I'D LIKE
THE NEXT MORNING WE WERE TAKEN TO A UNIQUE EVENT ONE VERY FEW JOURNALISTS HAVE EVER SEE INTO CAMP FROG
WOMEN IN THE ORGANISATION IS SAID TO HOLD THE SAME STATUS AS MEN AND ATTRACTIVE PROSPECT TO MANY UNPLEASANT WOMEN LIKE TANYA WHO ENLISTED AS A GIRL TO AVOID THE TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES IN HER VILLAGE
NAW I DON'T THINK ANOTHER ORGANISATION EXISTS OR VERY FEW OUTSIDE THE PARK WHERE THIS IS THE CASE BECAUSE IF WE LOOK TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD WERE MAN'S RIGHTS ARE ABUSED WERE MAN STIGMATISED JUST FOR BEING WERE WOMAN ON THE OTHER HAND HERE IN THE FAR ARC AS WERE MEN WE HAVE RIGHTS OPPORTUNITIES AND WE WORK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH MEN MOST PART GUERRILLAS SAY THEY TRUST THEIR LEADERSHIP IN HAVANA TO SECURE THE BEST DEAL FOR THEM
BUT SOME ARE PREPARED TO ADMIT TO DOUBTS ABOUT WHAT A POST CONFLICT FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF THEY TOLD ME AT THE START TO THINK ABOUT JOINING UP CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COLOMBIANS TO KILL COLOMBIANS THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE ME THINK TWICE
BUT THIS IS HOW THE WORLD IS I DON'T REGRET A LISTING BUT I DIDN'T JOIN TO KILL COLOMBIANS AND I'M CONSCIOUS THAT COLOMBIA NEEDS A CHANGE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER PEERS PROCESSES FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE M. NINETEEN GORILLAS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS FIELD AND LET THEM DOWN SO THAT'S WHERE OUR DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS COME FROM
WATCHING THIS GAME OF FOOTBALL AMONG THE FIGHTERS OF THE FART IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THERE ARE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THIS GROUP FULLY DIS ARMS AND BECOMES A POLITICAL MOVEMENT
WELL THEY WILL SAY THEY ARE BEHIND THE PEACE PROCESS TAKING PLACE IN HAVANA AND WILL DO AS ORDERED BY THEIR COMMANDERS THE LINGERING SUSPICION IS THAT SOMEONE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HAND OVER THEIR ARMS WHEN TOLD TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY FEEL THERE IS LITTLE AND WAITING FOR THEM ELSEWHERE IN COLOMBIA
STILL ONE OF THEIR TOP COMMANDOS WATERMEN DOS ERS SAYS HIS TROOPS WILL FOLLOW THE ORDER TO DISARM A WHEN I THINK THERE IS A HIERARCHY IN THE FUCK WE ALL OBEY ORDERS AND WE KNOW WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP FIRST AND FOREMOST THE FUCK IS A POLITICAL ORGANISATION
WHEN THE FARQUHAR'S WAS FOUNDED BEFORE TAKING UP WEAPONS WE WERE A POLITICAL MOVEMENT WERE OPTIMISTIC THAT WERE ABOUT TO TAKE A FUNDAMENTAL STEP TOWARDS PEACE
AS WE LEAVE THE JUNGLE IT'S BEEN A FASCINATING FEW DAYS IN A FROCK

THEIR JOURNEY AND IN THE MUD CLEARLY WORTH IT FOR MANY PEOPLE I CAN'T QUITE SEE IT MYSELF BUT THE MUSICIAN AND PRESENTER CARRIES MATTHEW'S IS HEADING THERE TODAY AS A HOST OF B. B. C. SIX MUSIC'S GLASTONBURY COVERAGE AND SHE'S WITH US NOW IN THE STUDIO MORNING CAROLINE MY NAME BUT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE EXPERIENCE WHATEVER THE WEATHER I THINK THE THING ABOUT FESTIVALS GENERALLY IS THE CHANCE TO PUT AWAY HER DAY TO DAY LIVES YOUR OFFICE LIVES THE HUMDRUM AND TO GO OUT INTO THE FRESH AIR AND JUST
ENJOY THE THE SORT OF SPONTANEITY OF WHAT HAPPENS AT FESTIVALS THE GLASTONBURY IS PROBABLY A BIG DADDY AND IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO A FESTIVAL BEFORE MIGHT NOT BE THE ONE TO START WITH THE EXCITING THING OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS SEEN THE SORT OF BEEN CHEST AND THESE FESTIVAL SPROUTING UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THEY'VE ALL GOT DIFFERENT KIND OF CHARACTERS SO YOU CAN FIND FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE INTO
BUT THE IDEA OF TRADITIONAL CRAFTS ARE THERE ARE PLENTY OF FESTIVALS OUT THERE LIKE MY OWN THE GOOD LIFE EXPERIENCE WHERE WE INVITE OVER FORTY MAKE US TO COME AND YOU CAN TRY OUT BLACKSMITH WORK AND OUR MALING POTTERY THAT SORT OF THING THEN THERE'S THE BIG DAY OUT NEXT WEEKEND WITH KATE HUMBLE AND THAT'S GOT MORE OF A FOCUS ON WILDLIFE AND FARMING
SO THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE FOR EVERYONE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE MAD LOOK AT THE SIZE OF GLASTONBURY IS ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW THAT'S MORE THAN THE POPULATION OF NORWICH THAT'S TWO TERMS BUS THAT'S THE POPULATION OF CARDIFF IN IN IN A FARM BUT I MEAN BUT THE THING THAT PUTS ME OFF IS WHEREVER WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING TO GO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COPE WITH THE PORTALOOS AND
GIVE UP YOUR CREATURE COMFORTS AND THE MUD AND ALL THE REST I'M JUST NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S THOUGH IS IF YOU COMPARE IT TO THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE LIVED FOR CENTURIES THERE WAS THAT MOMENT IN THE CALENDAR WHERE THE WHOLE VILLAGE THE WHOLE TOWN GOT TOGETHER AND JUST HAD A GOOD TIME IN THERE FRESH OUT OF DOORS
AND THERE'S A THERE'S A FEEL GOOD FACTOR ABOUT THAT SO YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SORT OF THE TOILET SO YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THE CHALLENGERS SURVIVE IN SO THAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR NORMAL DAY TO DAY WORRIES TOTALLY ASIDE AND SAID THAT GLASTONBURY'S I MEAN IT IT'S JUST SUCH A MASSIVE ENDEAVOUR AND SO MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO GO THERE THE THE EVERS FAMILY WHO FOUNDED IT PLEADED WITH PEOPLE'S YESTERDAY NOT TO ARRIVE TOO EARLY BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IF YOU PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THESE TICKETS
YOU'D WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY MOMENT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN THEY PUT THE MESSAGE OUT TO RUSH TO ARRIVE AND THEN YOU HEAR STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE PLAYING CRICKET IN THE ROAD IT'S ALL PART OF THE IRON IN THERE COS IT WAS STUCK IT IS PART OF THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE THERE YOU KNOW THAT THE WHOLE OF THE WHOLE EVENT JUST OPENS AND WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY LIKE DOLLY PARTON AND YOU'RE SINGING ALONG TO NINE TO FIVE AND SO MANY OF THEIR SONGS
AS A SEVENTY THOUSAND STRONG CROWD THAT SING ALONG MOMENTS I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING ABOUT FESTIVALS IN A BIT BUT WHEN YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT THE FESTIVAL EXPERIENCES TO THEIR MUSIC IS A PART OF THEM TO VARYING DEGREES I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT DIFFERENT ANYONE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING AS WELL IT'S GONE MAINSTREAM NOW ESPECIALLY SOMEWHERE LIKE GLASTONBURY AND SEE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHERE IN THE FLOWERY CATH KIDSON BOOTS NOT JUST THE INDIE KIDS GET UP
YOU HAVE FAMILIES YOU JUST HAD A FAMILY THEY'RE TAKEN ALL THEIR CHILDREN MANY GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE GOING IT'S GONE FROM BEING JUST FOR MUSIC FANATICS TO NOW BEEN A LIFESTYLE CHOICE I THINK IT'S A LOVELY ANTIDOTE TO OUR DAILY LIVES AND PUT THE GADGETS AWAY FROM THE NET AND I REALLY GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY WOULD WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HEAR THAT THIS YEAR'S GLASTONBURY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING RONNIE SPECTOR SHE'S PLAY IN THE PARK STAGE WHICH IS AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE GLASTONBURY SITE CREW AIR FAS PLANE SATURDAY NIGHT ERNEST WRANGLING
