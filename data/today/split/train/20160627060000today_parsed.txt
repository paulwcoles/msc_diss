CHRIS MARTIN OF COLDPLAY IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S GET A WEATHER FORECAST JOHN HAMMOND AS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE GOOD MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING SARAH FIRST DAY WIMBLEDON IT'S DAMP AND DRIZZLY S. W. NINETEEN AS I SPEAK HOWEVER THE WEATHER FRONT BRINGING THAT TO THE DAMPNESS IS CLEARING AWAY AND THINGS WILL BRIGHTEN UP ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST THERE IS IN FACT FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND MUCH OF THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH WALES HERE IT'S GOING TO BE
A FINE DAY ACTUALLY WANTS THAT EARLY DANCERS CLEARED AWAY SOME SUNSHINE FEEL QUITE PLEASANT WINDS NOT TOO STRONG AND TEMPERATURES UP INTO THE HIGH TEENS LOW TWENTIES IN THE SUNNIER PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST EVENTUALLY
FOR NORTH WALES NORTHERN ENGLAND HERE A LOT OF DRY WEATHER BUT SOME SHOWERS COMING ALONG PARTICULARLY AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY ACROSS SNOWDONIA AND TO THE WEST OF THE PENNINES BUT STILL SOME LENGTHY DRY AND BRIGHT SPELLS WILL BE QUITE CLOUDY AT TIMES TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN DEGREES BIT COOLER RUN EXPOSED COAST EXPOSED TO A WESTERLY BREEZE
NOW FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND THERE'S PLENTY OF DRY WEATHER OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT AND THERE WILL BE SOME BRIGHTER SPELLS THROUGH THE DAY PARTICULARLY TO THE EAST OF HIGH GROUND BUT OUT WEST ALREADY SOME SHOWERS ESPECIALLY FOR WESTERN SCOTLAND THE SHOWERS WILL TURN QUITE HEAVY I THINK WITH THE OLD THUNDERY ONE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON ON A BLUSTERY WIND BUT WITH SOME SHELTER STILL FOR EASTERN PARTS OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND THERE WILL BE SOME DRIER BRIGHTER SPELLS TO ENJOY FEELING COOL THOUGH HERE ACROSS THE NORTH WEST WITH THAT BREEZE
TEMPERATURES TYPICALLY AROUND ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES AT BEST OVERNIGHT IT'LL BE NICELY DRY QUITE A COOL ONE TEMPERATURES DOWN TO SINGLE FIGURES AND GOOD FEW PLACES ON TUESDAY WET WEATHER WILL SPREAD IN ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES THROUGH THE DAY FOR SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND A MIXTURE OF SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS BUT IT'S A VERY UNSETTLED WEEK AHEAD WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME RAIN
IT'S WIMBLEDON OF COURSE WE ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JOHN IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON I'M GOING ON SO SET A LABOUR LEADER MANY MANY YEARS AGO JEREMY CORBIN WAS NOT QUITE AS ELEGANT LAST NIGHT AS HAROLD WILSON ALL THOSE DECADES AGO BUT HE WAS JUST AS DEFIANT HE'S NOW FACING A FULL SCALE REVOLT AGAINST HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP TRIGGERED BY RAGE AT HIS FAILURE TO COMMENCE LABOUR SUPPORTERS TO BACK THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND TERROR THAT THEY COULD SOON BE A GENERAL ELECTION
IN WHICH A NEW TORY LEADER MIGHT INFLICT YET FURTHER DAMAGE ON HIS PARTY IT ALL BEGAN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF SUNDAY MORNING WHEN LABOUR'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN HILARY BENN WAS FIRED HAVING EVER SO GENTLY TRIED TO PERSUADE HIS LEADER TO QUIT
AT THIS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE E.U. REFERENDUM RESULT
THE LABOUR PARTY NEEDS STRONG AND EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO ACCOUNT AS WE TAKE DECISIONS OF HUGE IMPORTANCE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT THERE WAS ALSO NO CONFIDENCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION AS LONG AS JEREMY REMAINS LEADER AND I FELT IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE VACANCIES FOR SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY SHOULD IN NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY SHADOW CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH ALTOGETHER TWELVE SHADOW CABINET MINISTERS HAVE GONE IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAS SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY STAYING THOUGH SHE IS JEREMY CORBIN'S NEIGHBOUR IN ISLINGTON AND EMILY THORNBERRY SAID SHE THOUGHT THEY HER COLLEAGUES WERE LETTING DOWN THE COUNTRY
THE REFERENDUM HAS HAPPENED WE ARE COMING OUT OF EUROPE SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT FORWARD AN ALTERNATIVE THAT LOOKS AFTER EVERYONE AND UNITES THE COUNTRY NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BE GOING FOR A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THOSE WHO THINK THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE I THINK THAT THEY ARE LETTING DOWN THE COUNTRY I THINK THEY'RE LETTING DOWN THE UNITED KINGDOM
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL A LIFELONG REBEL ON THE LEFT OF HIS PARTY CATS UP ALL THIS TO THE LEADERSHIP ALONG WITH MISTER CORBIN DEFENDED HIS OLD ALLY REMINDING EM PEAS HAVE A STRONG MANDATE FROM THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP
JEREMY'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE HE'S ELECTED WHAT NINE MONTHS AGO WITH THE BIGGEST MANDATE OF ANY POLITICAL LEADER NOT COUNTRY MAN HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE THERE THE PEOPLE ARE SOVEREIGN AND A PARTY OTHER MEMBERS THAT'S THE MEMBERS WHO ELECT TO JEREMY AND HE'LL REMAIN AT TWENTY PAST NINE LAST NIGHT CHRIS BRYANT THE SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS QUIT ADDING TO THE LIST HE ISSUED THIS STATEMENT WHICH DECLARED
THE REFERENDUM HAS SHOWN THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM CANNOT RUN AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AND THAT YOU DO NOT COMMAND THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNTRY THE PRESENT SITUATION IS UNSUSTAINABLE WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD STEP ASIDE NOW FOR THE GOOD OF THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN BREAK THIS LOG JAM IS YOU IF YOU REFUSED TO STEP ASIDE I FEAR YOU WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MAN WHO BROKE THE LABOUR PARTY
JUST BEFORE TEN MISTER CORBIN HIMSELF ISSUED HIS OWN STATEMENT DECLARING THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BETRAY THE TRUST OF THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME ALL THE MILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY NEED LABOUR TO REPRESENT THEM THOSE HE SAID YOU WANT TO CHANGE LABOUR'S LEADERSHIP WILL HAVE TO STAND IN A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION IN WHICH IT WILL BE A CANDIDATE SO HE MAY BE GOING ON BUT SO TOO WAS WILL HEAR THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME IS THE PLOT TO REMOVE HIM
AND AT ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND IT IS THAT STORY OF COURSE VERY MANY OTHER VARIOUS OTHER RAMIFICATIONS OF OUR VOTE ON THURSDAY OR THROUGH THE PAPERS BORIS JOHNSON THOUGH WRITING THIS MORNING HIS ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH
IT IS SAID THAT THOSE WHO VOTED LEAVE WERE MAINLY DRIVEN BY ANXIETIES ABOUT IMMIGRATION I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HE'S SO HE WRITES AND HE MAKES THE POINT THE ONLY CHANGE AND IT WILL NOT COME IN ANY GREAT RUSH IS THAT THE U.K. WILL EXTRICATE ITSELF ON THE E. USE EXTRAORDINARY AN OPAQUE SYSTEM OF LEGISLATION THE VAST AND GROWING CORPUS OF LAW ENACTED BY A EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE OR HE
IT'S INSISTS THAT THERE WILL STILL BE INTENSE AND INTENSIFYING EUROPEAN CO OPERATION AND PARTNERSHIP BRITISH PEOPLE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GO AND WORK IN THE E.U. TO LIVE TO TRAVEL TO STUDY IT WILL
SURPRISED MANY PEOPLE HIS INTERPRETATION OF WIPE HOW PEOPLE WERE VOTING ON THURSDAY ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC TAKING IN A NUMBER OF THE FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES OR SOMETHING I'VE CERTAINLY NOT SEEN BEFORE ON THE CHARACTERISTIC PINK PAPER IS A LARGE BLACK BOX LIKE AN OBITUARY BRICKS A CRISIS IS THE TITLE THE HEADLINE POLITICAL TURMOIL AND ISOLATION U.K. CONFRONTS NEW REALITY
BRITAIN SAYS THE TOP LINE OF ITS STORY FACE THE STARK REALITY OF CRUMBLING INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD STAGE YESTERDAY AS TURMOIL TRIGGERED BY THE VOTE TO X. Y. YOU PLUNGE THE U.K. INTO DOMESTIC POLITICAL INSTABILITY IT'S A VIEW FROM ABROAD THE INTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMES WHAT USED TO BE CALLED THE HERALD TRIP OF COURSE IT'S HEADLINE VOTE ON Y. U. CONVULSES BRITISH POLITICS AND THE METRO WHICH IS JUST IN MOST BIG CITIES AROUND THE U.K.
RARELY HAS A HARDLY POLITICAL FROM PAGE BUT A STRIKING ONE TODAY THE LIGHTS ARE ON BUT NOBODY'S HOME IT SAYS OVER A PICTURE OF PARLIAMENT
POINTING OUT IT CLAIMED THAT TORY GOVERNMENT IS RUDDERLESS A THIRD OF THE SHADOW CABINET HAS QUIT AS A FIGHT IN SCOTLAND OVER INDEPENDENCE AND THREE MILLION SIGNING A PETITION CALLING FOR A RE RUN OF THE REFERENDUM IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR FRENCH PRESIDENT AND ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MEETING TODAY TO CONSIDER WHAT TO DO IN THE WAKE OF A BRECK'S IT VOTE DAMIEN GRIM ATTICUS IS IN BRUSSELS AND DAMIEN SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN VERY MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE HANDLED FROM THE DIFFERENT LEADERS
I THINK ACTUALLY TO BE FAIR THEY'VE BEEN FAIRLY SORT OF NUANCES AROUND THE SAME THEME WHICH IS THAT THEY SEEM TO BE COALESCING AROUND THAT IDEA NOW WHICH IS
THEY WOULD LIKE THE PROCESS OF SEPARATION TO BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT WE HAD THIS WRANGLING MERKL AT THE WEEKEND WE HEARD IT IN BRUSSELS HERE FROM OFFICIALS YESTERDAY THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND AS IT WAS PUT HERE IN BRUSSELS WAS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CRISIS IN THE U.K. NOT JUST OF LEADERSHIP BUT THE DEEPER ONE IS WHAT OFFICIALS HERE WERE SAYING
AND THAT THEREFORE IT COULD TAKE SOME TIME FOR THE U.K. TO BE IN A POSITION TO TRIGGER THEIR EXIT PROCESS BUT THAT OTHER SIDE FROM THAT I THINK THAT THE PRIORITY OF THOSE LEADERS WILL BE THEY WILL WANT TO COME OUT AND SAY THAT THEY ALL STAND BEHIND THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY BACK IT AND THEY WANT TO SORT OF SEND A MESSAGE OF CONFIDENCE IN HIM BECAUSE THEIR PARTICULAR CONCERN MUST BE THE EFFECT ON THE REST OF THE
YES ABSOLUTELY THAT IS EXACTLY THAT THEIR PRIMARY CONCERN NOW IS TO SORT OF STABILISE THINGS TO SEND OUT MESSAGES OF HOPE
TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PROCESS THAT THERE IS A PROCESS THERE'S A LEGAL PROCESS THAT THE E. U. HAS THAT'S WHAT MUST BE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY AS ANGLER MERKEL WAS SAYING UNDERSTAND
IF THE U.K. NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SHE SAID WE CAN WAIT A LITTLE BIT NOT VERY LONG BUT A LITTLE BIT FOR THE U.K. TO COME FORWARD WITH ITS INTO AND TRIGGER IS ITS EXIT BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THERE IS A NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER A NEW PRIME MINISTER AND THAT WON'T BE TILL OCTOBER THEY DON'T THEY MIGHT WANT IT TO HAPPEN SOON HAD TO END THE UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SAY TO THAT
NO THEY DON'T AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY THEY'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS IT IS IT IS UP TO THE U.K. SIDE TO DO IT AND LEGALLY IT'S A U.K. PRIME MINISTER YOU'VE HURT YOU HAS TO DO IT OFFICIALLY IN A LETTER OR A STATEMENT TO THE OTHER LEADERS OF THE ISSUE I THINK WILL BE THAT THEY AS THEY MADE VERY CLEAR HERE IN BRUSSELS YESTERDAY FROM THE U.K. POINT OF VIEW
THERE WILL BE NO TALKS ABOUT ANY TEA ANY SEPARATION ANY FUTURE DEAL UNTIL THAT OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION IS MADE SO WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK IS THAT WE WILL SEE THE IN A WAY IF YOU LIKE THE THE E.U. SIDES PREPARING ITS POSITION THAT ALL THE FOCUS BEING ON THE U.K. AND ON THE ISSUES AROUND THE LEADERSHIP AND WHO WILL COME TO DO THAT LATER LATER
ONCE THE U.K.'S POLITICAL ISSUES ARE RESOLVED DAMON GRAMMATICAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THEY MAY BE WAITING AND WATCHING IN THE CAPITAL'S AROUND EUROPE THE MARKETS DO NOT WAIT AND WATCH THEY MOVE AND WATCHING THEM IS DOMINIC O'CONNELL IN THE CITY DOMINIC
YES FROM THE CITY I'M ON THE TRADING FLOOR YOU B'S THE GIANT SWISS BANK AND AFTER THE SHOCK OF FRIDAY THERE'S A SLIGHT AIR OF UNREALITY IN THE SQUARE MILE TODAY IT'S AS IF HURRICANE HAD BLOWN THROUGH AND EVERYBODY'S COMING BACK TO FIND THAT THEIR HOUSE IS STILL STANDING BUT THE INDICATIONS ARE MORE STORM TO HIT PARTICULARLY IN ASIA WHERE AN OVERNIGHT TRADING THE POUND WAS DOWN I'M JOINED BY KARISHMA BUS FUNNY ASIAN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT KRISHNA WHAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT TO THE POUND
WELL WE'VE SEEN THE POUND DROP MORE THAN IT DID ON FRIDAY ABOUT TWO PER CENT BUT THE FALLS THAT WE SAW IN ASIAN MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THAT BREAKS IT SHOCK ON FRIDAY HASN'T BEEN MIRRORED TODAY IN FACT WE'VE SEEN JAPANESE MARKET'S POP UP A LITTLE BEYOND THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND KEY CRUCIAL MARK THERE AS WELL AS CHINESE SHARES IN FACT A LOT OF ASIAN LEADERS HAVE COME OUT AND SAID
THAT LOOK YOU KNOW OUR ECONOMIES ARE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF THIS ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM BRECHT'S IT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CHINESE PREMIER LI KA CHANG WHO STARES BRECHT'S IT WON'T HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY BUT DID THAN THAT IT IS HAVING A HUGE IMPACT WITH REGARDS TO GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHOULDN'T SO ABIE HAS HAD AN EMERGENCY MEETING TODAY WITH REGARDS TO THE LEVELS OF THE JAPANESE YEN IT'S STRENGTHENED REMEMBERED AS A RESULT OF BEING A SAFE HAVEN CURRENCY
AS THE INVESTORS SELL THE POUND THEY'RE BUYING THE YEN SO ALTHOUGH MARKETS AND ASIA ARE A BIT BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE ON FRIDAY THERE'S STILL A SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE DAYS AHEAD
THANKS VERY MUCH CREDIT KARISHMA BUZZ ONE WHO JOINED US FROM SINGAPORE UNCERTAINTY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME FOR FOR MANY PEOPLE OF MARKETS AND I'M JOINED BY JOHN KIRKLAND HIT OF MULTI ASSET MANAGEMENT AT SCHROEDER'S THE BIG FUND MANAGER TO TALK ABOUT THAT ONE THING THAT WAS PUZZLING PEOPLE I THINK I'D FIND IT WAS WHY DIDN'T THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FALL MORE THAN I DID IT WAS DONE ONLY THREE PER CENT AND ACTUALLY IN THE THE WEEKS FAMILY UP
THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES TYPICALLY HAVE QUITE A LOT OF OVERSEAS EARNINGS SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THE WEAKNESS IN THE POUND ACTUALLY HELPED OFFSET SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN THE U.K.
AND WHY HE VENTED EUROPEAN MARKETS THAT THE FRENCH MARKET IN THE GERMAN MARKET FOR MORE THAN A FOOT
I THINK THE CONCERN NOW IS THAT POTENTIALLY THIS POLITICAL WRIST NOW MOVES TO EUROPE AND IN PARTICULAR WE SAW THIS PARTICULAR GOING TO PERFORMANCE OF MARKETS LIKE ITALY ITALIAN MARKET FOR EXAMPLE WAS DOWN OVER TWELVE PERCENT WE HAVE SITUATION YOU'RE WHERE MANY THE BANKS ARE IN TROUBLE ANYWAY DICK INITIALLY BANKS UNDER CAPITALISED AND INFECTED WITH THIS WITH THIS INCREASED VOLATILITY THAT DOES NOT HELP THE SITUATION WAS READY FAIRLY FRAGILE
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE SPREAD ON ITALIAN BONDS RELATIVE TO GEMMA BONCE WHY DID BUY THIRTY BASIS POINTS ON FRIDAY WHICH AGAIN IS INDICATION OF CONCERNED ABOUT POLITICAL RISK IN EUROPE BUT IN MARKETS IT'S A BIT LIKE IT'S A BIT LIKE WATER ON A ROOF ISN'T IT MARKETS WILL FIND THE WEAKEST LINK AND IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE EUROPEAN MARKETS SOMETHING HAPPENED OVER HERE IN THE U.K.
BUT THE END RESULT WAS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING OVER THERE ON THE CONTINENT YES EXACTLY EFFECT TO BE THE WEAKEST LINK IS IS STILL IN CERTAIN PARTS OF EUROPE AND FOR THE TIME BEING WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT OTHER ASSETS WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR GOLD THAT ALWAYS A SAFE HAVEN IN THE CRISIS YES AND IN THE WAY THAT WE VIEW GOLD IS THAT IT BASICALLY IS A WAY OF MEASURING THE PROBABILITY OF THE FED HAVING TO REVERSE COURSE AND THERE IS A WRIST NOW THAT THE FED WON'T BE ABLE TO RAISE RATES
IF THE AND SATURDAY CREATED BY THE SITUATION YOU KAY DEPRESSES GLOBAL G.D.P. FATHER SO IN THAT SENSE WE SEE SOME SUPPORT FOR GOLD HERE BECAUSE THERE IS A PUP'S POSSIBILITY THAT WE DON'T SEE RATE WRITES IN THE IN THE
IT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT WE'VE FOCUSED ON THE FINANCIAL E'S IN THESE SITUATIONS BUT ACTUALLY MARKETS ARE VERY GOOD AT PRICING AND POLITICAL RISK AREN'T THEN YOU'VE BEEN TO THE WEEKEND THE TURMOIL IN THE LEADERSHIP A CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR PARTIES THEY ALL PLAY A PART IN WHAT TRADERS THINK
YES I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHO IS IN CHARGE WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNMENT WHAT WE WILL BE IN CHARGE THE GOVERNMENT AND ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY CORBIN IS REMAINING IN CHARGE OF AT THE LABOUR PARTY THERE QUESTIONS EVER BAT AS WELL SO I THINK THIS IS WHAT'S ADDING TO THE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE MOMENT
I'M JOINED BY DAVID TINSLEY THE U.K. ECONOMIST DUBIOUS DAVID WE HAVE A BIG STATEMENT COMING THIS MORNING AT SEVEN A.M. BEFORE THAT BEFORE THAT THE LONDON MARKETS OVER FROM GEORGE OSBORNE WHO AT LEAST MANAGED TO SPEAK BEFORE THE MARKETS OPEN UNLIKE THE THE THE PRIME MINISTER ON FRIDAY WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT THE CHANCELLOR TO SAY IT'S HIM
I THINK I DID ESSENTIALLY G'S EXPECT HIM TO REASSURE THE MARKETS BY TALKING ABOUT THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE TREASURY DURING ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO PROVIDE MOTORING FOR SCHOOL WOULD FINANCIAL STABILITY IN THE U.K. HE MIGHT REMIND YOU U.K. COLONY IS FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND AS CAMERON DID AND IN HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH AND DISCUSS SOME OF THE PHYSICAL FUNDAMENTALS HAVING IMPROVED IN THE U.K. ESSENTIALLY CAN'T DO MUCH BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.K.
AND THIS GREAT UNCERTAINTY OVER WHAT THEIR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU CAN HE LOOKS LIKE SO HE CAN'T OVERRATE THE CONFIDENT HE TRIES TO UNDERLINE BEFORE THE VOTE HE TALKED ABOUT AN EMERGENCY BUDGET SPENDING CUTS LOTS OF GLOOM AND DOOM DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THAT AFTER THE EVENT I DOUBT IT I SUSPECT HE WOULD LEAVE THOSE DECISIONS UNTIL THE AUTUMN STATEMENT WILL HE MAY MAKE A NOD TO THAT IN THIS STATEMENT ACTUALLY JUST TO PROVIDE THE MARKET SOME GUIDANCE ON THERE
AND HOW ABOUT HIS HIS DEFICIT TARGETS AND HIS OVERALL SPINNING PILOTS ARE THEY IN DANGER AS A RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENED ON PRIVATE BUT THEY ARE IN DANGER THEY DON'T FORGET THAT THE TARGET INCLUDES AN OUT AN EXCEPTION IN I'M NORMAL TIMES IN WHICH THE U.K.'S ESSENTIALLY IN A RECESSION
MOST ANALYSTS ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT RADIOGRAPHER NEXT YEAR CITY HE HAS THAT GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD ON FRIDAY YOU PUPS ARE VERY INTERESTING NOTE ABOUT WHAT YOU EXPECT IN THE BIG PICTURE FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY WHERE DO YOU THINK INTEREST RATES ARE GOING BY THE END OF THE YEAR
WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE FIFTY BASIS POINTS LOWER ZERO ESSENTIALLY ALTHOUGH THE FOAL IN STIRLING IS GOING TO ADD TWO NEAR TURN INFLATIONARY PRESSURE ULTIMATELY WE THINK THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY IMPACT ON GROWTH JOBS EXCEPT HER HE'S GOING TO TRUMP
THOSE CONCERNS FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND THEY GONNA CUT RATES PROBABLY IN AUGUST AND THEN AGAIN IN NOVEMBER SO JUST REPEAT THAT INTEREST RATES AT ZERO ZERO IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS WELL IT'S IT'S
IT'S GOOD NEWS IN THE SENSE THAT HE WILL OFFSET SOME OF THE BRACTS IT SHOCK IF YOU LIKE BUT HE'S REALLY THE FACT THAT YOU KAY RATES AT ZERO I WOULD STILL BE RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO MANY GLOBAL KIND IT'S REALLY JUST UNDERLINES THE PARLOUS STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY GENERALLY I THINK WE REALLY ARE IN UNCHARTED WATERS ARMY FOR FOR GLOBAL MARKETS AND INTEREST RATES AT ZERO OR BELOW AND MANY OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMIES WE WHAT THE CENTRAL BANKS DO NEXT
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN AS FAR AS FAR AS THE U.S. IS CONCERNED THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT THE ABILITY TO DELAY THE HIKING CYCLE THAT WAS ON THEIR RADAR AS FAR AS EASY B. IS CONCERNED THE QUANTITATIVE EASING THEIR DOING WAS DUE TO EXPIRE IN MARCH TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY CAN PUSH THAT FORWARD BUT THESE BANKS ARE GETTING NO NOT A GREAT DEAL OF BANG FOR THEIR BARK THESE DAYS AND I THINK THIS IS AS THEY SAY IN THE MARKET OR THE NEW NORMAL THEY MAY BE RUNNING OUT OF AMMUNITION
LEAVING ASIDE THE WORLD CENTRAL BANKS WE TURN TO THE REAL ECONOMY NOUN WITH ME IS SIMON WALKER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS SIMON YOU SING OBEYED YOUR MEMBERS AFTER THE VOTE ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS WHAT DID THEY TELL ME THAT THE VOTE FOR WHAT THEY WOULD DO A THEATRE COMPANIES WON'T BUSINESS LEADERS OF VERY VERY CONCERNED TWO THIRDS OF THEM THINK IT'S NEGATIVE FOR THEIR BUSINESS OR A BUSINESS OF ALL SAINT SHAPES AND SIZES
I HAD TWO THIRDS THINK IT'S NEGATIVE THIRTY SIX PER CENT ARE PLANNING TO CUT INVESTMENT
AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT MORE THAN A FIFTH ARE PLANNING A HIRING FREEZE NOW
FIVE PER CENT OR HAD SHE CAN HAVE REDUNDANCIES SO PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED INDEED BUT NEARLY HALF OF THEM EXPECT THE OTHER MEMBER STATES TO
PUNISH BRITAIN BUT I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED HOW MUCH DAMAGE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY CAUSE THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY VOTE IT WILL VOTING FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND I LIKED IT WAS SEXUAL
BUT MIKA TUFFERS FROM OFF THIS POLE I SURPRISED ME FOR THE PAM HAD BEEN AN INTERVIEW OVER THE WEEKEND THE DEFENCE SECRETARY SAID HE THOUGHT THE INWARD INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. HAD COMPLETELY DRIED UP IT WAS AT A STANDSTILL
DO YOU THINK THAT THE YOUR POLE SUPPORTS THAT I THINK IT'S A I THINK I PROBABLY REFLECTS I THINK WE CAN EXPECT WE'D EXPECT A COMPLETE STORE UNTIL PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING LOOK OVER TO SOME POINT CRYING OVER SPILT MILK
OVER TIME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T LOSE THE FAITH THAT BUSINESS TO RECOVER BUT IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SHOCK WITH A LOSS OF JOBS
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND IT LOOKS AS IF THAT IS GOING TO PERMEATE THROUGH THE WHOLE OF BRITISH BUSINESS PATRICK MINFORD ONE OF THE LEADING ECONOMISTS UP ON THE ON THE LEAVES SIDE SAID OVER TIME IF WE LIFT THE E.U. IT SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD MOSTLY
ELIMINATE MANUFACTURING BUT THIS SHOULDN'T SCARE A SWAB IT SCARES ME AND I SUSPECT IT SCARES AN AWFUL LOT OF OUR MEMBERS AND HERE'S PHILIP AND OF COURSE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OF THE DEFENSIVE DRILL THING ABOUT HIS PREVIOUS JOB
BUT SIMON JUST TO BE FAIR YOU'RE SERVE IT ALSO SHOW THAT WAS EXPECTED NO CHANGE AT ALL YES IT'S TRUE HEART HALF OF OUR MEMBERS THINK THEY CAN KEEP GOING SO SO IT'S ALL THAT'S RIGHT BUT THIRTY SIX PER CENT PLUNDERED CUT INVESTMENT
MORE THAN A FIFTH OF PLANNING IT DROPS FREEZE AND SOME ARE PLANNING REDUNDANCIES MEAN THIS IS A VERY NEGATIVE RESULT DOESN'T BUSINESS HAVE TO SHARE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BURDEN FOR THAT RESULT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE NOT
REALLY CONNECTED WITH BIG BUSINESS LEADERS WHEN THEY SAID TO THEM WE WANT TO VOTE YOU WISH YOU SHOULD VOTE REMAIN EFFECT HAVE IGNORED WHAT THEY WERE TOLD BY THIS ISN'T THERE A BIG QUESTION OF TRUST AND BUSINESS IT IT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUSINESS HASN'T DONE THE MOST BRILLIANT JOB OF SELLING THE BENEFITS OF GLOBALISATION BUT HE DID SAY
THAT THIS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY DAMAGING IT WAS ALWAYS THE ELECTRICS RIGHT TO SAY THE ECONOMY DIDN'T MATTER THAT MUCH AND NIGEL FARAGE IS ALWAYS SO
BUT THEY GIVE PRIORITY ASSAULT FRONTIER ISSUES BUT I DON'T THINK THEY KNEW THEY WERE VOTING FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC CHAOS
THANK YOU RIGHT SIMON I'VE JUST COME OUT TO DAVID TINSLEY FINALLY DAVID BUT ONE THING THAT MAY HAPPEN TODAY HAS A CREDIT DOWNGRADE FOR THE U.K. FROM THE STANDARD AND POURS THE BIG U.S. RATINGS AGENCY DO YOU EXPECT THEN HIM AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS IT REALLY SERIOUS IF WE LOSE THAT TRIPLE A. RATING
I WOULDN'T BE SURE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT OR NOT BUT CERTAINLY IT'S POSSIBLE INCLUDING THE ALONG TIME OUTPUT OUTLOOK OF THE ECONOMY IS MUCH MORE IN THE NEAR TERM THE FISCAL POSITIONS WORSE DOES IT MATTER THAT MUCH WELL
I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE U.K. ANY DEAL AND IF WE GET SOMETHING APPROXIMATING E.U. MEMBERSHIP OUTSIDE PERHAPS IT'S NOT QUITE SUCH A BAD SITUATION BUT THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY THANK YOU MUCH DAVID INTO THE U.K. ECONOMY FOR EYES ON GEORGE OSBORNE AT SEVEN I AM THE MARKETS OPEN

BUT HAPPILY HE HAS GOOD MORNING MORNING I'D LIKE TO HAVE STAYED IN BED I THINK YOU PROBABLY NEED TO CANCEL ALL THOUGHTS OF SUCH THINGS FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I THINK WITH THE WEEK FINALLY HERE FROM THE CHANCELLOR AND INDEED THE PRIME MINISTER AGAIN AFTER WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG PERIOD OF SILENCE
AND CRUCIALLY WE HEAR FROM BORIS JOHNSON BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND THE BRACTS ARE TEARS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH HIDING UNDER THE DUVET WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM THEM TODAY BORIS JOHNSON GIVES US THE FIRST CLUES OF HOW HE SEES BRECK'S IT BEGINNING TO UNFOLD AND WHAT IS STRIKING ABOUT IT SEEMS TO ME THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT BORIS JOHNSON TO THE BORIS JOHNSON WHO DROVE THE BRICKS HAD BANDWAGON THIS IS A MUCH MORE CONCILIATORY
PRAGMATIC BORIS JOHNSON SO HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY IN THIS DAILY TELEGRAPH ARTICLE TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO VOTED REMAIN ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR ANXIETY AND CONCERN AND SEEKING TO REASSURE THEM BUT WHAT I FIND STRIKING THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH PRESENT A VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF TONE AND STANCE TO THAT TO YOUR DOCTOR DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SO FOR EXAMPLE ON IMMIGRATION IS THAT'S HER LOOK IMMIGRATION WASN'T REALLY THE BIG ISSUE IN THIS
REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND THAT OF COURSE COMES AFTER PHILIP HAMMOND YESTERDAY SAID WELL THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPROMISE OVER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND YOU JUST WONDER WHETHER THERE IS THE BEGINNINGS OF THE LOWER RING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ACHIEVABLE ON IMMIGRATION ON THE SINGLE MARKET BORIS JOHNSON SAYS WE WILL RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND STEVIE SAYS STILL BE ABLE TO WORK AND TRAVEL IN THE E.U. BUT TO DO THAT
PRESUMABLY YOU STILL HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND OF COURSE DURING THE CAMPAIGN THEY REVILE THE SINGLE MARKET THEY DECRIED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT WE WERE ADAMANT THEY WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE ECONOMY HAVING PRETTY MUCH HELD UP MARK CARNEY AS A HATE FIGURE AND THROWING DARTS AT HIM THIS MORNING BORIS JOHNSON SAYS HE HAS DONE QUITE A SUPERB JOB AND
ALSO SEEMS TO WAIVE AN ALMIGHTY OLIVE BRANCH IN THE FACE OF GEORGE OSBORNE SAYING THE ECONOMY IS IN GOOD HANDS I JUST WONDER OF THE REALITY OF POTENTIAL POWER AND THE ENORMITY OF THE DECISION THAT HE'S NOW FACING BORIS JOHNSON IS FORCING HIM TO A DOCTOR AND WE SAY ANY MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO BRACK'S IT NOTHING LIKE THE WHIFF OF POWER IN THEIR NOSTRILS NORMAN IT WOULD BE SELFISH TO ASK YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELLS WE DELAY ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES
PERFECT THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THAT COLLEAGUE IS A ROSS HAWKINS HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO ROSS WE HAD JEREMY CORBIN INSISTING LATE LAST NIGHT THAT HE WILL STAND IN ANY NEW LEADERSHIP ELECTION IN THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE'S LOST TWELVE OF HIS SHADOW CABINET IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD OVER THE WEEKEND ARE WE EXPECTING MORE RESIGNATIONS TODAY YES WE ARE AND AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE IF YOU LIKE ROLLING DREADFUL NEWS FOR JEREMY CORBIN MAYBE SOME OF THE SHADOW MINISTERS OF STATE
GOING PRETTY REGULARLY THROUGH THE MORNING THERE WERE I UNDERSTAND HAPPENED IS IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS AND FRIDAY MORNING A SMALL GROUP OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO HAVE NOT COME ONTO THE RADIO REGULARLY TO CRITICISE JEREMY CALLED WE MADE THE DECISION TO TURN AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF THE REFERENDUM AS IT WAS PUT TO ME THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE STARING INTO THE ABYSS THEIR WORDS OF THE GENERAL ELECTION WITH HIM IN CHARGE AND THEN TWO SEPARATE THINGS HAPPENED YESTERDAY THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT
ONE THERE WERE THE RESIGNATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO THEY ALWAYS INTENDED TO GO SPACED OUT TO PROVIDE THIS ROLLING NEWS BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO SURPRISE THEM WHO WERE NEVER PART OF THIS PLAN WHO SEEM TO BE MAKING THEIR OWN DECISION ORGANIC FEED THAT AS I SAY WILL CONTINUE THE CRUCIAL MEETING TODAY AT SIX P.M. WE HAVE M.P.S AND PEERS FROM LABOUR MEETING TO DECIDES A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE TOMORROW BUT THIS IS THE CRUCIAL POINT THAT NO CONFIDENCE VOTE IS NOT
ANYWHERE IN THE LABOUR RULE BOOK AND JEREMY CORBIN CAN AND IN EFFECT ALREADY HAS SAID BUT FORGET THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ME YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT BY THE RULE BOOK AND I'M JUST GONNA RE APPOINT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS MY TOP TEAM
AND A CRUCIAL QUESTION I THINK FOR THE COUNTRY THIS MORNING IS WHAT HAPPENS IF HE FAILS IN THAT SHORT TERM TASK BECAUSE IF HE DOES WE COULD BE IN EFFECT OF A SORT OF ZOMBIE OPPOSITION OF JUST A HANDFUL OF LOYALIST TO JEREMY CORBIN AND HIM AND JOHN MCDONNELL FACING A PRIME MINISTER WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK TO THE COMMONS TODAY ACROSS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHO IN EFFECT IS A CARETAKER PRIME MINISTER WHICHEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION FOR THE COUNTRY TO BE
ROSS HAWKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE IS NEWS BEYOND BRICKS IT THE NAME FOR LOU JA OF COURSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES IN THE RECENT BLOODY HISTORY OF A RAG THE COUNTRY'S PRIME MINISTER HIS URGES PEOPLE TO REJOICE AFTER GOVERNMENT FORCES TOOK THE CITY AFTER A FOUR WEEK BATTLE
WITH I.S. THE B.B.C. CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD IS AHMED MINE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW WAS THIS BATTLE OVER SLIGHTLY QUICKER THAN PERHAPS THE FEAR'S THERE HAD BEEN WHEN THE MOVE STARTED ON FALLUJAH
YES INDEED THE TEMPO AND THEY DID THE PACE WAS VERY QUICK AND SWIFT COMPARED TO PREVIOUS BATTLES TO RE TAKE CITIES AND TOWNS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BUT THIS IS BASICALLY DUE TO THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. LED
IT WAS TRIKES AT THE MASSIVE FORCE ON THE GROUND WE WAS TALKING ABOUT ROUGHLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS IN FALLUJAH
AND ALSO THE RESOLVE OF THE ER THE IRAQI TROOPS BECAUSE OF THE THE THE THE BATTLE OF FALLUJAH WHICH WAS TRIGGERED ON MAY THE TWENTY THIRD BASICALLY IT CAME AFTER A STRING OF
BLOODY BOMBINGS IN BACK THAT WHICH GIVE THE GOVERNMENT FORCES MORE REASONS TO EXCEL YOU WAIT
IT'S A BIT LIGHT THE THE ENTIRE BETTER TO RE TAKE THE CITY AND THE NEXT TARGET FOR THE GOVERNMENT THEN WOULD BE MOSEL
YES THIS IS CALLED HERE IN IRAQ THE MOTHER OF ALL BACK TILTS BECAUSE MOSUL IN THE NORTH IN NORTHERN IRAQ IS THE MAIN THE STRONGHOLD OF THE ISLAMIC ESTATE ORGANISATION AND ALSO THE CITY IS HEAVILY POPULATED
AND QUITE LARGE COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES WHICH USED TO BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF ISIS OR THE ISLAMIC STATE WE HAVE TALKING ROUGHLY ABOUT MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE CITY ITSELF IN MOSUL ITSELF AND ITS NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES
AS FOR FALLUJAH BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD IT'S STILL GONNA BE SOME TIME BEFORE CIVILIANS CAN RETURN
YES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN LOST WEEKEND WE HAVE BEEN TO FALLUJAH AND WE HAVE SEEN SO MUCH DESTRUCTION WE HAVE SEEN OURSELVES UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE SO IT'S NOT QUITE SAFE
FOR NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE WE AIN'T INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HOME ATTEMPT ANY TIME SOON HOW MEN IN BAGHDAD THANK YOU
IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND A SPLENDID PICTURE OF THE PALACE OF WESTMINSTER AT NIGHT FILLS THE FRONT PAGE OF THE METRO THE HEADLINE SAYS THE LIGHTS ARE ON BUT NOBODY'S HOME THE PAPER SUGGEST THE GLORIOUS FACADE IS A HOLLOW SYMBOL NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS RUDDERLESS THE OPPOSITION IN DISARRAY AND THE UNION WITH SCOTLAND IN QUESTION AGAIN THE DAILY MAIL BELIEVES THE TORIES AND LABOUR ARE LIKE FLOUNDER AROUND WONDERING HOW TO EXPLOIT THE RESULT TO THEIR PERSONAL ADVANTAGE
I'M SURPRISED ME PERHAPS THERE WERE CALLS FOR UNITY AND RECONCILIATION INCLUDING ONE FROM BORIS JOHNSON IN THE TELEGRAPH RESOLUTE MEN AND WOMEN SAYS THE DAILY EXPRESS NEED TO BAND TOGETHER WE NEED SMART LEADERS AND WISE COUNSEL DIFFERING SHADES UNITED IN ONE GOAL THE LEADING LEAVE CAMPAIGNER ANDREA ANDREA LEAD SOME IN THE TIMES SAYS THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MARKED OUT THE ROAD AHEAD AND WE NEED TO BE MOVING DOWN THAT ROAD CAREFULLY AT FIRST BUT ALSO WITH CONFIDENCE
THE F. T. SAYS THAT A HURRICANE OR STRUCK BRITISH POLITICS A CARTOON BY STEVE BELL IN THE GUARDIAN IS A MENACING SKY A SINKING SHIP AND JEREMY CORBIN CLINGING TO A DECKCHAIR WHAT NEARLY ALL THE OTHERS ASK IS FOR HOW MUCH LONGER PAUL ROW LEDGE OF THE MIRROR SAYS SIMPLY HE HAS TO GO AND THE SOONER THE BETTER ROSA PRINCE IN THE TELEGRAPH COMPARES HIM TO A CHILD TEARFULLY CLUTCHING HIS FOOTBALL LONG AFTER THE OTHER KIDS HAVE GONE HOME HE CLINGS TO THE LEADERSHIP WITH AN IRON GRIP THAT BELIES THE MYTH HE WAS LOATHE TO SERVE
THE VETERAN LABOUR M.P. FRANK FIELD ARGUES IN THE TIMES THE LABOUR NEEDS A NEW LEADER AND UNITY BECAUSE THE NEW CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER WILL CALL AN IMMEDIATE GENERAL ELECTION AND LABOUR SAYS MATTHEW NORMAN IN THE EYE CANNOT BE LED BY SOMEONE WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION THE ARK THE GUARDIAN DESCRIBED MY CORBIN STATE OF MIND AS DEFIANT THERE ARE OTHER NEWS STORIES IN THE PAPERS AS A REPORT IN THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE WEATHER THIS SPRING BROUGHT DANGERS FOR MANY BIRDS
IT SAYS PAIRS MATED IN A WARM SPELL BUT TEMPERATURES HAD FALLEN SHARPLY BY THE TIME THEY'RE CHICKS HATCHED AND RAIN WASHED THE CATERPILLARS THE BIRDS FEED ON OFF THE TREES AND LEAVES SPREAD SPREAD SLOWLY SAYS THE TIMES FROGS HATCH LATER AND SWALLOWS WERE SIGHTED MUCH LATER THAN LAST YEAR AND HAVE CAUSING THEM FACE ICELAND AT THE EUROS TONIGHT THE TIMES HAS A PHOTO OF THE MANAGER ROY HODGSON WITH HOMES PRESTO VIEWS EYES ASK AN IMPORTANT QUESTION HE CAN'T WATCH
BUT CAN YOU MAIL OFF AS A COUPLE OF PAGES OF USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT ICELAND IT'S ERUPTING VOLCANOES THE PEOPLE'S APPETITE FOR RAW PUFFIN HEARTS AND FERMENTED SHARK MEAT AND THE FACT THAT THEIR BUILDERS NEGOTIATE WITH THE ELVES THEY BELIEVED TO BE HOLDING UP CONSTRUCTION WORK BUT MOST THE PAPERS JUST CAN'T RESIST SOME OBVIOUS GAGS ABOUT ENGLAND'S WINGER STERLING BOUNCES BACK IS THE HEADLINE IN THE TELEGRAPH WHAT'S THE SUNDA DECLARES STERLING RISES
IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS TO MAKE A STATEMENT IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TRY TO REASSURE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AFTER THE REFERENDUM RESULT CAUSE TURMOIL ON FRIDAY
AND ON FRIDAY COMMEMORATIONS THIS FRIDAY WILL BE HELD TO MARK THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME IT'S A BATTLE WITH PARTICULAR RESONANCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND UNIONISTS HAVE LONG REVERED THE ROLE OF THE THIRTY SIX ULSTER DIVISION WHICH MADE BIG ADVANCES ON THE FIRST DAY BUT SUFFERED THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN HOW IRISH NATIONALIST LOOK ON THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND A RECOGNITION THE PROTESTANTS AND CATHOLICS FROM ALL OVER IRELAND FOUGHT IN THE CONFLICT OR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS PAGE NOW REPORTS
THIS IS A CHURCH GRAVEYARD NEAR BUSHMILLS AND COUNTY TRUMP THE INSCRIPTION ON THE HEADSTONE OF SERGEANT ROBERT QUICK SAYS HE WON THE VICTORIA CROSS FOR MOST CONSPICUOUS BRAVERY AT THE BATTLE OF THE SAW
LEONARD QUICK IS THE GREAT NEPHEW OF THE SOLDIER HE DISCOVERED THAT HIS PLATOON COMMANDER WAS MISSING OUT OF NO MAN'S LAND HE WENT OUT SEVEN TIMES LOOKING FOR HMM NEVER ACTUALLY FIND THEM BUT EACH TIME HE BROUGHT BACK A WOUNDED SOLDIER
SO HIS MOST CONSPICUOUS BRAVERY WHICH IS REFERRED TO ON HIS CITATION IS FOR BRINGING IN THOSE SEVEN HUNDRED MEN UNDER MACHINE GUN AND SHELLFIRE
ROBERT QUAKE WAS ORIGINALLY A MEMBER OF THE ULSTER VOLUNTEERS A MALICIOUS SET UP TO OPPOSE THE PROSPECT OF HOME RULE FROM DUBLIN WHEN WAR BROKE OUT MANY ORPHAN JOINED THE ARMY FORMING THE THIRTY SIXTH ULSTER DIVISION THEY WERE IN THE BARN GARDEN OF THE SOMME OFFENSIVE
MANY OF THE ORANGE SMARTIES AND STICK THIS HERE EVERY SUMMER LETS ME HELP SPECIFICALLY TO COMMEMORATE THE BATTLE OF THE SAW
YOU CAN ALBIE IS BEING LED BY LIT BY DRESS THE SOLDIERS IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR
IN THIS COMMUNITY THE MEMORY IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT ALMOST SIT
WE'VE GOT SOME UNIONIST LOYALIST COMMUNITY MEANS I'LL BE HOME SAFE THEY SOLVE IT WON'T STOP THE INTEGRA THAT'S SPECIALLY THE CONNING A BRAND THAT'S ALL THANKS I'VE GOT A POLISH MY GRANDFATHER FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN SO I HAVE TO ALL HIS MEDALS FROM THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME AND I FEEL VERY PROUD
I'M WALKING HERE TILL EIGHT THE BLOODY BUT NOT ON THIS JUST HAVE TO
HISTORIAN PHILIPPA WORE EXPLAINS HOW THE BATTLE CAME TO BE REGARDED AS A DEFINING EVENT FOR UNIONISM IT WAS SEEN IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AS BEING SOME KIND OF A SACRIFICE REALLY THAT HAD BEEN MADE IN ORDER TO PROVE ULSTER PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
UNIONISTS FEEL THAT THEY HAVE SOME ON THE SALEABLE SAY ON BRITISHNESS NATIONALISTS FOUGHT AND DIED AT THE SWORD TO THE SIXTEENTH IRISH DIVISION WAS MAINLY MADE UP OF CATHOLICS FROM THE SOUTH OF IRELAND BUT AFTER IRISH INDEPENDENCE THAT LEGACY DIDN'T FIT WITH THE NARRATIVE INITIALLY IN THEIR POST COLONIAL SITUATION FOR IRELAND THIS WAS PERHAPS A SUBJECT FOR SHAME THE STORY GOT PUSHED AWAY
OF COURSE WHEN THE TROUBLES BEGAN AND BRITISH TROOPS WERE ON THE STREETS OF NORTHERN IRELAND IT BECAME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN A BRITISH SOLDIER IN RECENT YEARS I THINK CARRIED INTO THE PEACE PROCESS
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A GENUINE INTEREST IN MERGING IN WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN DO IT WHEN I LEAVE DONORS PAID MY FRIEND
AND SLEEP WITH FLOWERS I LOVE APART
THIS IS A SIGN OF PROFOUND CHANGE MARTIN MCGUINNESS OF SINN FEARED READING APPALLED BY THE IRISH WAR REPORT FRANCIS LED WHICH AT HIS GRAVE IN FLANDERS
WHEN WOUNDS ARE FLUTTERING THE FLAVOURS OF SUMMER OR BUILD HER OWN
IT WOULD ONCE HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE FOR AN IRISH REPUBLICAN TO LES REED IS AT THE WESTERN FRONT BATTLE SITES WE ARE RECOGNISING THE REALITY OF THAT ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND IRISH MEAL FROM ONE OF IRELAND'S THIRD THIRTY CHEEK IS LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR I THINK IT WAS ALL PART OF THE JOURNEY THAT WE'RE ALL ON TOWARDS PEACE AND RECONCILIATION AND I HOPE THAT MY VISIT HERE AS TO HOW THE FRIENDSHIP TO UNIONIST BUT ALSO
EVERYBODY ASKS THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED HERE WERE AS MUCH PART OF WHAT WE ARE AS THEY WERE PART OF
IN IRELAND HISTORY IS ALWAYS COMPLEX AND OFTEN CONTENTIOUS BUT THE FIRST WORLD WAR IS BECOMING MORE OF A SHARED STORY FOR THE CENTENARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME THE EMPHASIS IS ON REFLECTION AND REMEMBRANCE
TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN ONCE AGAIN THE THRILLS AND SPILLS HAVE ARRIVED AT A THEME PARK HAVE TURNED INTO SOMETHING GRIMLY TERRIFYINGLY REAL TEN PEOPLE ATE OF THAN CHILDREN WERE INJURED WHEN A ROLLERCOASTER DERAILED AND CRASHED AT THE M. AND D. PART NEAR MOTHERWELL CHIEF INSPECTOR DAVID BRUCE OF POLICE SCOTLAND GAVE THIS ACCOUNT OF THE ACCIDENT
IT WAS QUICK CLEARLY DISTRESSING AND JUST OUT OF CHILDREN
IT WAS JUST IN THE WRECKAGE IS QUITE CLEARLY FAR TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE THAT THE CAUSE OF THAT ACCENT BUT THE GONDOLAS HANG FROM A SUCH A LOVELY OIL HERE BYE
A SERIES OF OVERALL WASN'T THE GAMBLE FOR WHATEVER REASON PART OF ALL OF THEM HAVE HAVE DETECTION EELS YEAH COURSE NIPPED IT TO BREATHE
THE TRACK JOIN AIR BY COLIN BLANE ARE SCOTLAND CORRESPOND MORNING TO YOU COLIN IS THERE AN UPDATE ON THE INJURED NOT YET BUT WE LEARNED LAST NIGHT THAT THREE OF THOSE CHILDREN WERE SERIOUSLY HURT AND WERE HOPING TO HAVE AN UPDATE ON VIA CONDITION LATER IN THE MORNING PERHAPS SOME TIME AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK
OF COURSE THIS ACCIDENT IS SHOCKING IN ITSELF BUT EVEN MORE SO WHEN YOU'RE REMINDED THAT IT'S NOT THE FIRST NOT EVEN THE SECOND TIME THERE'S BEEN TROUBLE AT THE STEAM BATH NO THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INCIDENTS EARLIER THIS YEAR EIGHT PEOPLE HAD TO BE RESCUED BY FIREFIGHTERS FROM ANOTHER RAID AT THE PARK THE TORNADO RIGHT AND THEN NINE PASSENGERS INCLUDING CHILDREN WERE STRANDED FOR EIGHT HOURS ON THE TSUNAMI WAY THAT'S THE SAME ONE
THAT CRASHED YESTERDAY THEY WERE STRANDED IN JULY TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN IT CAME TO A HALT ABOUT SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AT THAT TIME NOBODY WAS HURT NOBODY WAS HURT IN THE PREVIOUS AT SAINT NOT A SERIOUS AS THE ONE THAT WITH THAT WE'VE JUST HAD IT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND OF COURSE THAT ONE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON'S INCIDENT VERY SERIOUS INDEED AND AS EVER AFTER ENSA'S THIS OR INCOME HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE TO TRY AND DISCOVER WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
THAT'S RIGHT THE PARK IS CLOSED TO POLICE HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES AND OF COURSE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXECUTIVE OF THE NO CURLING AT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS A DREADFUL INCIDENT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE POLICE THAT THE TRAIN OF FIVE GONDOLA CARRIAGES DETACHED FROM THE REAL DOES IT CAME ROUND A CORNER AT THEN SEEMS TO HAVE COLLIDED WITH THE RIDES MAIN STRUCTURE AND THEN FELL TWENTY FEET TO THE CONCRETE BELOW SO PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE ROAD WERE IN THE MAIN TRAPPED UPSIDE DOWN IN THEIR HARNESSES
DREADFUL AND THE INJURIES WERE SIMPLY TO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THOSE OR TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AS WELL WELL THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY ON THE GROUND WHO WAS HOT AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THE NUMBER ON THE RIDE WAS NINE I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE TALLY THERE WERE TEN SO IT LOOKS AS IF SOMEONE ON THE GROUND WAS HOT TOO
COLIN BLANE I'LL SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT THANK YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM AN EYEWITNESS TO THAT DREADFUL XD AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON HAS SUGGESTED SHE COULD TRIED TO BLOCK THE U.K. FROM LEAVING THE E.U. SARAH SMITH IS A SCOTLAND EDITOR AND JOINS US FROM EDINBURGH AND SARAH DOES SHE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT
WHAT SHE SAID IS THAT SHE BELIEVES WESTMINSTER WILL NEED TO AS THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT FOR ITS LEGISLATIVE CONSENT FOR ANY CHANGES TO THE SCOTLAND ACT THAT WOULD BE A NECESSARY PART OF LEGISLATING FOR BREAKS IT AND SHE VERY CLEARLY SAID SHE WOULD EXPECT THE PARLIAMENT TO VOTE AGAINST THAT MOTION AND THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD DO SO THE REAL QUESTION THOUGH AS IF HOLLYWOOD DOES WITHHOLD ITS CONSENT IS THAT EFFECTIVELY A VETO THAT COULD BLOCK THE U.K. TAKES IT FROM THE E.U.
LEGAL OPINION SUGGESTS NOT BUT THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION OF COURSE IS THROWING UP ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT FRANKLY NO ONE REALLY KNOWS THE ANSWER TO AND THEN WHAT THE NEXT STEP IF THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL WOULD BE TO CALL FOR A REFERENDUM WE SHE SAID IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE HE'S NOT DEFINITELY COMMITTED HERSELF TO THAT THAT'S BECAUSE NICOLA STURGEON KNOWS SHE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE A SECOND REFERENDUM SO SHE NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN SHE CAN WIN IT BEFORE SHE SETS A DATE
ALREADY A COUPLE OF PULLS SHOWING INCREASE SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE WE'VE EVEN HEARD OF FORMER LABOUR FIRST MINISTER SAYING HE WOULD NOT VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE BUT BREAKS IT DOES ACTUALLY RAISED SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT INDEPENDENCE WHAT CURRENCY WOULD AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND USE THAT BECOMES RATHER MORE COMPLICATED WITH THE NEED TO BE A HARD BADA ALONG THE RIVER TWEED STOPPING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AS WELL AS POSSIBLY A TRADE BARRIER
NICOLA STURGEON WANTS TO WAIT AND SEE IF THIS CURRENT SURGE OF SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENCE WILL SURVIVE A DEBATE ABOUT THESE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE SHE ACTUALLY CALLS ONE SARAH SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IF THERE IS TO BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM THEN IT'S IN CONDITIONS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST ONE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN PAUL JOHNSON IS DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES
THE FISCAL SITUATION IN SCOTLAND WERE TO BE INDEPENDENT DOES STILL LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THAT IN THE REST OF THE U.K. FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THE SCOTS ARE ABOUT AS RICH ON AVERAGE IS AS WE ARE IN ENGLAND AND SO THEY PAY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX PER PERSON BUT THEY HAVE A LOT MORE SPENT PER PERSON ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE DO
IN ENGLAND AND THAT MEANS THERE'S A BIG TRANSFER RESOURCES FROM ENGLAND TO SCOTLAND AT ACTUALLY THAT LOOKS CONSIDERABLY WORSE NOW THAN IT DID AT THE TIME OF THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BECAUSE OIL REVENUES OF ESSENTIALLY DRIED UP THERE'S THERE'S NOT NOT MUCH AT ALL IN THE WAY OF OIL REVENUES WHAT MIGHT THIS LOOK LIKE POST BRECK'S IT
WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT MIGHT CHANGE AND IN PARTICULAR A WORLD IN WHICH ENGLAND OR OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE SCOTLAND INSIDE YOU MIGHT SEE A BIT OF A SHIFT BECAUSE
TAX REVENUES AND ENGLAND WOULD FOR SURE FALL PARTICULARLY AS FINANCIAL SERVICES THE CITY EMPLOYMENT BEAR DROPPED WHEREAS IF SCOTLAND STAYED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEN THEIR ECONOMY MAY WELL DO BETTER THAN THAT OF THE REST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. PAUL JOHNSON OF THE I AIR FIRST DENNIS CAN HAVE AND IS A FORMER CHAIR OF YES SCOTLAND THE CAMPAIGN FOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND JOINS US FROM STIRLING GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THAT IS A DIFFICULTY FOR THE HAVING A SECOND REFERENDUM NOW THAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THE OIL PRICE ARE FAR WORSE
BUT THERE'S A DIFFICULTY BUT IT'S NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTY THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE WAS NEVER EVER PREDICATED SIMPLY ON THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF OIL THE ECONOMIC KISS WAS VERY MUCH BASED ON WELL
PARTLY ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY INCLUDING THE IMPORTANCE OF INWARD INVESTMENT IF A POTENTIAL INWARD INVESTORS IS NO LOOKING AT PART OF THE WORLD AND DAMS OF ACCESS TO THE SINGLE EUROPEAN MARKET THEN THAT INVESTOR IS NOT GOING TO DO TO ENGLAND OR SCOTLAND OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE U.K.
BUT PROBABLY THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND OF FRANCE AND BELGIUM MELONS BUT PRESENTS A POTENTIAL LOSS OF JOBS TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND UNDER A DAMAGED ECONOMY AND THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENCE FOR SCOTLAND IS STRENGTHENED BY THE FACT THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A HALL HAS REPORTED TO EXIT SO WHAT THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY WOULD DO WELL BECAUSE PEOPLE THEY WOULD
THE INWARD INVESTMENT THAT ENGLAND WOULD NORMALLY ATTRACT GOES TO SCOTLAND INSTEAD
YES I DON'T WHAT DID IT IT DID TO THE BORDER BUT THEY HAVE VOTED BY A CLEAR MAJORITY DO FOR BRICKS AT THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF THEM VOTED TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE ACHIEVED NOW IS IF SCOTLAND BECOMES INDEPENDENT AND THAT'S WHY I SEE A SECOND REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE BRING IT ON AND BRING IT ON WITH A PROPOSAL THAT SCOTLAND HAS SCOTLAND THE SCOTTISH CURRENCY IS THE EURO
WELL THERE ARE VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR COULDN'T SEE THESE WERE SET OUT IN THE PREVIOUS WEIGHT AND HAVE TO UPDATE UPDATE THESE OPTIONS OBVIOUSLY AND DESPITE WHAT'S YOUR THINKING AT THE MOMENT RULE OUT THE EURO OR SAY O.K. LET'S GO FOR IT AND I WILL GO FOR AN INDEPENDENT SCOTTISH BONED UP WOULD BE MY MY MY PREFERENCE AREN'T IN THE LONGER AND NO LONGER WANT TO CONSIDER JOINING THE EUROZONE I MEAN AND THE BORDER BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND ENGLAND
I DON'T WANT TO SEE A HARD BOARD A BIT BITTER BETWEEN BETWEEN SCOTLAND THAT IF THAT'S THE PRICE THAT'S NEEDED BUT IT WELL YOU'LL HAVE A HARDBOARD AND BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND IT WILL BE A HARD TO BE BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE REST OF EUROPE BUT AT LEAST THE REST OF WHAT IS NOW THE EUROPEAN UNION AT THIS ALL THIS WAS AHEAD THEM IN THE BRICKS IT DO YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ALL THIS OUT THERE BEFORE I'M NOT ONE FOR CREATING UNNECESSARY BAUBLES
BUT I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF BEING MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN FAMILY AND MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DENNIS CAN HAVE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND JOHN HAMMOND HAS THE WEATHER JOHN NICK IT'S BRIGHTENING UP AT WIMBLEDON HE SHOULD BE THE BEST DAY OF THE WEEK IN ACTUAL FACT THERE'S PLENTY OF RAIN ON THE HORIZON BUT YESTERDAY PRETTY PROMISING PARTICULARLY ACROSS MORE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. AND I'LL START WITH SOUTHERN ENGLAND

HER SILENCE THUS FAR IS IN CONTRAST TO HER RESPONSE TO THE OUTCOME OF THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM WHICH URGE PEOPLE TO UNITE IN A SPIRIT OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND SUPPORT
BUCKINGHAM PALACE SAID LAST WEEK'S POLL HAD BEEN A MATTER FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO DECIDE OFFICIALS ARE KEEN TO STRESS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER PROVIDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN SCOTLAND AND THE CURRENT ONGOING INTO MULCH WAS PROCESS
A SURVEY OF BUSINESS LEADERS SUGGESTS TWO THIRDS OF COMPANIES THINK THAT BREAKS IT WILL BE BAD FOR THEIR FIRMS THE POLE BY THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS FOUND THAT A QUARTER OF COMPANIES WERE THINKING OF FREEZING PLANS TO RECRUIT MORE STAFF HOWEVER NEARLY A HALF SAID THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM WOULDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS SIMON WALKER THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS TOLD US PEOPLE WERE VERY WORRIED
NEARLY HALF OF THEM EXPECT THE OTHER MEMBER STATES TO PUNISH BRITAIN
I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED HOW MUCH DAMAGE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY CAUSE THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY VOTE IT WILL VOTING FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND A LIGHTLY RECESSION AND THE NEGATIVE TUFFERS FROM OFF THIS POLE I HAS SURPRISED ME
SPAIN'S SECOND ELECTION AS IN SIX MONTHS HER FAILED TO DELIVER A CONCLUSIVE RESULT THE CONSERVATIVE POPULAR PARTY OF THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER MARIANNA ROCK HOY WON THE MOST SEATS BUT HE'S SHORT OF A MAJORITY MY BOY HAS CLAIMED HIS PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO GOVERN SERRA RAINFORD REPORTS
SPAIN'S POPULAR PARTY WON THIS ELECTION SECURING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SEATS IN THE COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT IT EVEN INCREASED ITS SUPPORT BUT NOT BY ENOUGH TO GOVERN ALONE
SO ONCE THE CELEBRATION STOP HERE THE WRANGLING OVER COALITIONS WILL BEGIN AND IT WON'T BE EASY THE CLOSEST PARTY IDEOLOGICALLY TO THE P. P. HER SAID BEFORE THAT IT WILL LINK UP WITH THE PARTY UNLESS IT'S LEADER IS REMOVED
THE OTHER SURPRISE FROM SUNDAYS VOTE WAS THE LEFT WING PROTEST PARTY POD AMOS DIDN'T SOAR IN THE POLLS
SINCE THE LAST VOTE SPAIN HAS ENJOYED SIX MONTHS OF POLITICAL PARALYSIS OR PARTIES ARE NOW UNDER PRESSURE TO REACH A COMPROMISE FORM A COALITION AND GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNING
POPE FRANCIS SAID THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH SHOULD SEEK FORGIVENESS FROM HOMOSEXUALS FOR THE WAY IT'S TREATED THEM HE SAID THE CHURCH HAD NO RIGHT TO JUDGE THE GAY COMMUNITY AND SHOULD AFFORD THEM RESPECT SOME CONSERVATIVE CATHOLICS HAVE CRITICISED HIM FOR MAKING COMMENTS THEY SAY ARE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT SEXUAL MORALITY
EIGHT CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS ARE BEING TREATED IN HOSPITAL AFTER A ROLLERCOASTER DERAILED AND CRASHED AT A THEME PARK NEAR MOTHERWELL THREE OF THE CHILDREN ARE IN A SERIOUS CONDITION THE AND DEE'S PARKER'S BEEN CLOSED WHILE HEALTH AND SAFETY OFFICIALS CARRYING OUT AN INVESTIGATION
NOVAK DJOKOVIC WILL BEGIN THEIR DEFENCE OF WIMBLEDON WIMBLEDON TITLE AGAINST BRITAIN'S JAMES WARD ON CENTRE COURT THIS AFTERNOON THERE ARE SEVEN OTHER BRITISH PLAYERS IN ACTION ON THE OPENING DAY OF THE TOURNAMENT THEY INCLUDE THE WORLD NUMBER SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MARCUS WILLIS WHOSE OPPONENT IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO PLACES ABOVE HIM WILLIS WHO WON SIX QUALIFYING MATCHES TO REACH THE MAIN DRAW HAS COLLECTED JUST FORTY SEVEN POUNDS IN PRIZE MONEY ALL YEAR
IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NO SIGN OF THE CHANCELLOR YET WE SOON AS WE HEAR FROM HIM THAT WE WILL GO ACROSS TO HIM LET'S MOVE ON WITH THE PROGRAMME WELL WE'RE WATCHING A SCREEN SOON IF WE SEE ANY SIGN WE WILL GO TO HIM PEOPLE DIDN'T VOTE OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRATION THEY VOTED OUT TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR LAWS THAT'S THE GIST OF THE ARTICLE THAT BORIS JOHNSON HAS WRITTEN IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE PUTS HIS HAT IN THE RING TO BE CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER HE HASN'T GOT A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FROM FELLOW M.P.S BUT ONE WHO DOES SUPPORT HIM HE'S THE SKILLED MINISTER NICK BOLES WHO VOTED REMAIN HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHY WHY SUPPORT BORIS JOHNSON GIVEN THAT EFFECTIVELY WE'RE OUT PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIM
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY HARD DECISION AND NOT ONE THAT I CAME TOO QUICKLY OR EASILY AND I'M SURE THAT OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL WILL FIND IT HARD BUT I BASICALLY HAD TO SORT OF FOUR MAIN REASONS THE FIRST IS THAT I THINK IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS SOMEBODY WHO SUPPORTED BRECK'S IT FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE NATION IN A VERY HIGH TURNOUT POLE SUPPORTED THAT PROPOSITION NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF CONSERVATIVE VOTERS DID AND THEY EVEN HIGHER PROPORTION OF CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS AND I THINK IT'S JUST INCONCEIVABLE
BUT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO COULD BASICALLY BELIEVES IT'S A BAD IDEA LEADING THE GOVERNMENT THAT WILL BE OVERWHELMINGLY FOCUSED ON THIS ON THIS OBJECTIVE AND THEN I THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH A TOP LEVEL EXPERIENCE THIS REALLY IS SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA BE PITCHED INTO ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT JOBS IN THE WORLD AT ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIMES
I THINK FOR ME I WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S A GENUINE ONE NATION LIBERAL AND BORIS'S RECORD AS MAYOR A DEMONSTRATOR THAT'S REALLY WHO HE IS AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW PARTY LEADERS HAVE TO WIN ELECTIONS AND WE MAY FACE AN ELECTION SOONER THAN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN REACH PARTS OF BRITAIN THE OTHER CONSERVATIVES CANNOT REACH COULDN'T ALL THOSE THINGS BE SAID OF THERESA MAY ALTHOUGH SHE DID
SHE WAS A RELUCTANT REMAIN ONE SUSPECTS THAT ACTUALLY HER HEART MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY IN THAT ONE NO I DON'T THINK I'M A HUGE FAN OF TREES AROUND IT ISN'T ONE OF THE STRONGEST HOME SECRETARIES IN MODERN TIMES BUT SHE DID NOT BACK BRICKS IT SHE DID SAY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT WE'D BE BETTER OFF IN AND I'M NOT SURE HER ELECTORAL APPEAL IS QUITE AS STRONG AS BORIS'S
ALAN DUNCAN TOLD US THAT A JOHNSON PREMIERSHIP WOULD BE LIKE A PERMANENT RIDE ON A BIG DIPPER
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR EITHER I CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CONCERN COMES FROM IN TERMS OF SOME OF BORIS'S SORT OF BEHAVIOUR IN HIS EARLY PART OF HIS CAREER BUT I THINK HIS EIGHT YEARS AS MAYOR AND INDEED HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH WHICH I STRONGLY DISAGREED BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS DISCIPLINED AND HE WAS SERIOUS AND HE WAS FOCUSED AND I THINK THAT HE HAS MATURED ENORMOUSLY AS A POLITICAL LEADER
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS I WAS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE START OF YOUR HIGHNESS MAYOR YOU WILL HAVE READ I'VE GOT A LONG WAY SINCE THEN OH K. PATTY SEEMS TO TRAVEL A LOT WAY TO SINCE WHAT HE WAS SAYING IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IF YOU READ HIS ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY WHERE HE SAYS THOSE WHO VOTED LEVER MANIA DRIVEN BUT WE'RE NOT MAINLY DRIVEN BY ANXIETIES ABOUT IMMIGRATION THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TAKE AWAY FROM THURSDAY'S VOTE THE MANY WOULD BELIEVE I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU PERHAPS WE CAN COME BACK TO YOU BUT WE CAN NOW CROSS TO THE TREASURY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE
WELL GOOD MORNING SURGERY TODAY I WANT TO REASSURE THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY THAT BRITAIN IS READY TO CONFRONT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH THAT IS BECAUSE IN THE LAST SIX YEARS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE WORKED HARD TO REBUILD THE BRITISH ECONOMY
WE WORK SYSTEMATICALLY THROUGH A PLAN THAT TODAY MEANS BRITAIN HAS THE STRONGEST MAJOR ADVANCED ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
GROWTH HAS BEEN ROBUST EMPLOYMENT RATE IS AT A RECORD HIGH
THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BANKS ARE TEN TIMES WHAT THEY WERE
AND THE BUDGET DEFICIT HAS BEEN BROUGHT DOWN FROM ELEVEN PERCENT OF OUR NATIONAL INCOME WAS FORECAST TO BE BELOW THREE PERCENT THIS YEAR
I SAID WE HAD TO FIX THE ROOF SO THAT WE WERE PREPARED FOR WHATEVER THE FUTURE HELD AND THANK GOODNESS WE DID
AS A RESULT OUR ECONOMY IS ABOUT AS STRONG AS IT COULD BE TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGE I'LL COUNTRY NOW FACES AND THAT CHALLENGES CLEAR
ON THURSDAY THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS NOT THE OUTCOME THAT I WANTED OR THAT I THREW EVERYTHING INTO CAMPAIGNING FOR
BUT PARLIAMENT AGREED THAT THERE ARE ISSUES OF SUCH CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE BUT THEY CANNOT BE LEFT TO POLITICIANS
MUST BE DETERMINED BY THE PEOPLE IN A REFERENDUM
NOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN WE IN THIS DEMOCRACY MUST ALL EXCEPT THAT RESULT AND DELIVER ON THEIR INSTRUCTIONS
I DON'T RIZAL FROM ANY OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED DURING THE CAMPAIGN
I FULLY ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM AND WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE IT WORK FOR BRIT
IT IS INEVITABLE AFTER THURSDAY'S VOTE THE BRITAIN'S ECONOMY IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST TO THE NEW SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THE TREASURY ANOTHER INDEPENDENT ORGANISATIONS PRODUCED THREE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES WERE IDENTIFIED AND I WANT TO SAY HOW WE MEET ALL THREE
FIRST THERE IS THE VOLATILITY WE HAVE SEEN AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO SEE IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
THOSE MARKETS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THE REFERENDUM RESULT
BUT THE TREASURY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY HAVE SPENT THE LAST FEW MONTHS PUTTING IN PLACE ROBUST CONTINGENCY PLANS
THE IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL AFTERMATH IN THE EVENT OF THIS RESULT
WE AND THE P. R. A. HAVE WORKED SYSTEMATICALLY WITH EACH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN RECENT WEEKS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE READY TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF A VOTE
SWAP LINES WERE ARRANGED IN ADVANCE SO THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS NOW ABLE TO LEND IN FOREIGN CURRENCY IF NEEDED
AS PART OF THOSE PLANS THE BANK AND WE AGREED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE STATEMENT ON FRIDAY MORNING FROM THE GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY
AS MARK MADE CLEAR THE BANK OF ENGLAND STANDS READY TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION OF THUMBS THERE IT'S NORMAL FACILITIES
TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT BANKS AND THE SMOOTH FUNCTIONING ON MARKET
AND WE DISCUSSED A COORDINATED RESPONSE WITH OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES IN CALLS ON FRIDAY WITH THE FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS OF THE G. SEVEN
THE GOVERNOR AND I HAVE BEEN IN REGULAR TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER OVER THE WEEKEND AND I CAN SAY THIS MORNING THAT WE HAVE FURTHER WELL THOUGHT THROUGH CONTINGENCY PLANS IF THEY ARE NEEDED IN THE LAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FELLOW EUROPEAN FINANCE MINISTERS CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS
THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE I.M.F. THE U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY AND THE SPEAKER OF THE U.S. CONGRESS AS WELL AS THE C.E.O.S OF SONG A MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO THAT COLLECTIVELY WE KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON DEVELOPMENTS
IT WILL NOT BE PLAIN SAILING IN THE DAYS AHEAD
LET ME BE CLEAR YOU SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE OUR RESOLVE
WE WERE PREPARED FOR THE UNEXPECTED AND WE ARE EQUIPPED FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS
AND WE ARE DETERMINED THAT UNLIKE EIGHTY YEARS AGO BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM WILL HELP OUR COUNTRY DEAL WITH ANY SHOCKS
AND DAMPEN THEM NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE SHOCKS
OR MAKE THEM WORSE
THE SECOND CHALLENGE OUR ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED IN ADVANCE WAS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THEY VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD BRING IN THE COMING MONTHS AND BEYOND AS BRITAIN WORKED WITH ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES TO CREATE A NEW RELATIONSHIP
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN US TIME AS A COUNTRY TO DECIDE WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE BY DELAYING THE DECISION TO TRIGGER THE ARTICLE FIFTY PROCEDURE UNTIL THERE IS A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN PLACE FOR THE AUTUMN
ONLY THE U.K. CAN TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY
AND IN MY JUDGEMENT WE SHOULD ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE IS A CLEAR VIEW ABOUT WHAT NEW ARRANGEMENTS WE ARE SEEKING WITH OUR EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS
IN THE MEANTIME AND DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WILL FOLLOW THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE TO PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO TRAVEL AND WORK AND THE WAY OUR GOODS AND SERVICES ARE TRADED ALTER THE WAY OUR ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS REGULATED
HOWEVER IT IS ALREADY EVIDENT BUT AS A RESULT OF THURSDAY'S DECISION SOME FIRMS ARE CONTINUING TO PAUSE THEIR DECISIONS TO INVEST OR TO HIRE PEOPLE
AS I SAID BEFORE THE REFERENDUM THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND THE PUBLIC FINANCES AND THERE WILL NEED TO BE ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT
GIVEN THE DELAY IN TRIGGERING ARTICLE FIFTY AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S DECISION TO HAND OVER TO A SUCCESSOR IT IS SENSIBLE DECISIONS ON WHAT THAT ACTION SHOULD CONSIST OF WAIT FOR THE O.B. ARD TO ASSESS THE ECONOMY IN THE AUTUMN AND FOR THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TO BE IN PLACE
BUT NO ONE SHOULD DOUBT OUR RESOLVE TO MAINTAIN THE FISCAL STABILITY WE HAVE DELIVERED FOR THIS COUNTRY
AND TWO COMPANIES LARGE AND SMALL I WOULD SAY THIS
THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG WE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE
WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS
THE THIRD AND FINAL CHALLENGE I SPOKE OF WAS THAT OF ENSURING THEIR BRITAIN WAS ABLE TO AGREE A LONG TERM ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST OF EUROPE
PROVIDED FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMS OF TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES
TOGETHER MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GOVERNMENT IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND IN PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE TERMS SHOULD BE AND WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS AND ALLIES TO AGREE
I INTEND TO PLAY AN ACTIVE PART IN THAT DEBATE FOR I WANT THIS GREAT TRADING NATION OF OURS TO PUT IN PLACE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC LINKS WITH OUR EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS
AND WITH A CLOSE FRIENDS IN NORTH AMERICA IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND ARE IMPORTANT PIPE PARTNERS LIKE CHINA AND INDIA
I DO NOT WANT BRITAIN TO TURN ITS BACK ON EUROPE OR ON THE REST OF THE WORLD
WE MUST BRING UNITY OF SPIRIT AND PURPOSE AND CONDEMN HATRED AND DIVISION WHEREVER WE SEE IT
BRITAIN IS AN OPEN AND TOLERANT COUNTRY
AND I WILL FIGHT WITH EVERYTHING I HAVE TO KEEP IT
TODAY I AM COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON THE TASK IN HAND AS TRANSFIXED WRECKER TO BRING STABILITY AND REASSURANCE
THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND I WILL ADDRESS MY ROLE WITHIN THAT IN THE COMING DAYS
IN CONCLUSION THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN US THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THERE IS MUCH TO DO TO MAKE IT WORK
WE START FROM A POSITION OF HARD WON STRAIGHT
AND WHATEVER THE UNDOUBTED CHALLENGES MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE DETERMINED TO DO THE BEST FOR BRITAIN
THANK YOU I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOUR QUEST GEORGE OSBORNE THEY'RE SPEAKING IN THE TREASURY DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT A DARK TIE AND A WHITE SHIRT NOT QUITE A FUNEREAL CLOTHING BUT NOT THAT FAR US LISTENING TO THAT WITH ME SIMON JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR I THOUGHT WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY STRIKING THERE SIMON
WAS THE PROMISE THAT WHAT WAS DUBBED A PUNISHMENT BUDGETED ONWARDS TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS WILL COME BUT DON'T COVER THE AUTUMN PRESUMABLY DELIVER BY ANOTHER CHANCELLOR YEAH NOT YET HE SAID HE'D WAIT WAIT FOR THE O.B. ARE FORECAST TO SAY TO SEE WHAT IMPACT THIS DECISION HAS ON THE ECONOMY BEFORE HE SETS OUT
HIS RESPONSE TO IT I THINK HE BASICALLY WE COULD INFER WE KNEW ALREADY FROM THE TIMING OF THIS SPEECH THAT WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS REASSURE PEOPLE REASSURE FINANCIAL MARKET'S A BIT THE WAY SIMILAR TO THE WAY MARK CARNEY DID ON FRIDAY THING LISTEN WE'VE GOT YOU THERE ARE SOME GROWN UPS IN CHARGE YOU'VE GOT A PRIME MINISTER WHO'S RESIGNED WE HAVEN'T SEEN GEORGE OSBORNE TILL THIS MORNING SOMETHING A WORD
WHO'S RUNNING THE COUNTRY AND SO HE CAME OUT AND SAID LOOK IT UP HAD A CHAT WITH THE BANKS HAVE HAD A CHAT WITH THAT WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR SO WE'VE GOT THINGS UNDER CONTROL ARE WE COMING FROM POSITION OF STRENGTH AND WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THIS CLAIM THAT THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS HE PUT IT I ASSUME HE MEANS THE BANKS WILL PLAY A ROLE FOR STABILITY THIS TIME ROUND COMPARED WITH WHAT HE SAID WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CONTRIBUTING TO INSTABILITY BUT OF COURSE THE BANKS OF THE ONCE WHOOP CATAPULTED US INTO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
HERE HE IS SAYING IS THAT WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND STANDING BEHIND THEM THE BANKS WILL MAKE SURE THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF CASH THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF FOREIGN CURRENCY WE CAN SMOOTH AND OIL THE WHEELS OF COMMERCE WHEN IF IF CASE THERE ARE ANY SEIZURES YOU'VE JUST SAYING LOOK WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WE DID SOME CONTINGENCY PLANNING I'VE SPOKEN TO ALL THE BANKS THEY'RE ON SIDE AS WELL WERE READY FOR THIS AND HE WAS CLAIMING ALSO THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES WHO HAD DELAYED INVESTMENTS
WERE DELAYING THE CREATION OF NEW JOBS AND NOW WOULD CONTINUE TO DO IT WITH A POTENTIALLY VERY SERIOUS IMPACT ON THE BRITISH ECONOMY HE WAS HE WAS TRYING TO SUGAR COAT THIS HE SAID WE SAID THAT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT COMPANY INVESTMENT BUSINESS INVESTMENT MIGHT ALL SLADE OUT IF WE WERE TO VOTE THIS WAY AND IN FACT WE'VE HAD AND A POLE FROM THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS TODAY HE SAID MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO FREEZE I THINK THAT EVERYONE'S JUST TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A PAUSE CHECKING THEMSELVES ARE BRUISES AND THINKING HOW DO WE PROCEED IT WOULD BE AMAZING
IF INVESTMENT IN SOMEWAY DIDN'T GET AFFECTED ALSO LISTENING TO NOW AND IN THE CITY OF LONDON DOMINIC O'CONNELL JOINS US MORNING DOMINIC COME ON
I'M JOINED BY DAVID TIM'S U.K. CUT YOU CAN EUROPEAN U.B.S. AND DAVID ONE THING WE TOOK OUT OF THAT AS WELL AT SOME THE CHANCELLOR'S ABILITY TO SPIN ON A SIXPENCE AND THEN CAMPAIGNING TALK ABOUT THE THE HORRIBLE FATE THAT AWAITED THE U.K. EFFORT IF THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE HAD THE STRONGEST DEVELOP ECONOMY IN THE WEST I HAVE THE BANKS HAVE BEEN FIXED AND HELP INWARD INVESTMENT INVESTORS SHOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED
BUT THE OTHER BIG THING I TOOK OUT OF THAT WAS HE REFERRED BACK CONSTANTLY TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION SO MUCH DEPENDS ON THIS DOESN'T IT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN IT'S ABSOLUTELY KEY THAT SINGLE MARKET ACCESS AND FREEDOM AND MOVEMENT ARE PRESERVED REALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL
AS FAR AS THE U.K. IS CONCERNED SO I THINK INTERESTING ALONG WITH BORIS JOHNSON'S TELEGRAPH ARTICLE THIS MORNING THERE'S A BIG PUSH I THINK AT THE MOMENT TO GET QUITE A LOT OF CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE EVEN AFTER DEPARTURE HOW WOULD YOU EXPECT THIS TO CLAY UP BECAUSE THERE'S A KIND OF A CHICKEN AND EGG THING HERE ISN'T THERE HE HAS AN AUTUMN STATEMENT COMING UP AND WHAT SHE HAS TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT SPENDING
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE LEADERSHIP BATTLE GOING ON THERE'S THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE FEW REPORT OR IMPORTANT NOT WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE THERE'S A FEW MOVING PIECES IN THE STICKS JIGSAW AREN'T THERE YEAH THERE ARE AND THEY'RE ALL ON DIFFERENT TIME LINES AND OF COURSE AMONGST ALL OF THIS TO U.K. ECONOMY WE EXPECTING MOST COMMENTATORS EXPECT WILL BE WEAKENING
AS THE TREASURY WARNED BEFORE THE VOTE SO WHY WELL THE CHANCELLOR'S STOCK MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE TOO HIGH AT THE MOMENT IN IN SOME CONSTITUENCIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SIX MONTHS IF THE ECONOMY DOES DECELERATE SHARPLY THAT PICTURE ITSELF COULD CHANGE QUITE A LOT AS WELL THAT THE BIGGEST THREAT REALLY HERE IS THE SECOND OF OSBORNE'S CHALLENGES ISN'T UNCERTAINTY PEOPLE NOT KNOWING QUITE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO DECIDING NOT TO INVEST OR PUTTING INVESTMENTS ON HOLD WHILE THE WHOLE THING SORT OF
IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE HOW THAT CAN BE AVOIDED REALLY AND WE'VE GOT TWO YEARS PLUS BUT POTENTIALLY OF UNCERTAINTY AHEAD OF US AND SO ANY BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE WARY OF COMMITTING TOO MUCH OVER THAT PERIOD A PLAN IS WHAT'S NEEDED RIGHT NOW AND WE THINK
THANK YOU MUCH DAVIDSON TO U.K. AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIST NUBIA'S DOMINIC O'CONNELL THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT IS WIMBLEDON AND GARY RICHARDSON IS THERE AS USUAL AT THE START FORM WITH A SPORTS NEWS MORNING GARY SIR A VERY GOOD MORNING FROM THE CENTRE COURT THE CENTRE COURT COVERAGE IS ON ITS GREY OVERCAST MORNING BUT FINGERS CROSSED IT SHOULD BE FINE LATER CORRESPONDENT RUSSELL FULLER IS HERE TO MAP OUT THE DAY AHEAD MORNING RUSS IT WILL ALL START WITH JEAN COVERAGE HERE AT ONE O'CLOCK

ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE LEAF CAMPAIGN BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH TO LEAVE THE E.U. SETTING OUT HIS VISION FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE RESULT MY JOHNSON WHO'S TIPPED TO SUCCEED DAVID CAMERON AS PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE STILL BELIEVES BRITAIN WILL BE ABLE TO RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHILE RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN IS EXPECTED TO BE HIT BY MORE RESIGNATIONS TODAY AS HE FIGHTS TO KEEP HIS JOB MISTER CORBIN IS DEFYING CALLS TO STEP DOWN AND WILL MEET HIS DEPUTY TOM WATSON TO DISCUSS THE WAY FORWARD ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW FRONT BENCH HAVE NOW RESIGNED
A SURVEY OF BUSINESS LEADERS SUGGESTS TWO THIRDS STINK BREAKS IT WILL BE BAD FOR THEIR COMPANIES THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS ALSO FOUND A QUARTER OF FIRMS WERE THINKING OF FREEZING PLANS TO RECRUIT MORE STAFF BUT NEARLY HALF SAID THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM WOULDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON INVESTMENT PLANS
SPAIN'S SECOND ELECTION IN SIX MONTHS HAS FAILED TO DELIVER A CONCLUSIVE RESULT THE CONSERVATIVE POPULAR PARTY OF THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER MARIANNA ROCK HOLLY AT ONE OF THE MOST SEATS BUT HE'S SHORT OF A MAJORITY MY HOY HAS CLAIMED HIS PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO GOVERN
EIGHT CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS HAVE BEEN TREATED IN HOSPITAL AFTER A ROLLER COASTER DERAILED AND CRASHED AT A THEME PARK IN NORTH LANARKSHIRE THREE OF THE INJURED CHILDREN ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT M.N.D. EAST THEME PARK IN MOTHERWELL HAS BEEN CLOSED WHILE HEALTH AND SAFETY OFFICIALS CARRY OUT AN INVESTIGATION
AND COLDPLAY BROUGHT GLASTONBURY TO A CLOSE WITH A RECORD FOURTH HEADLINE PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT THEY WERE JOINED ON STAGE BY THE FOUNDER MICHAEL EAVIS WHO HAD DESCRIBED IT AS THE MUDDIEST FESTIVAL EVER HAD ALSO BY BARRY GIBB FROM THE P.D.'S THANK YOU CHARLES ARE TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT
I HIRED YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A DECENT MAN TO DO THE DECENT THING AND TAKE THE ONLY ACTION THAT CAN AVERT POTENTIAL DISASTER BY STEPPING ASIDE SO SAID THE TWELFTH OF THE ANGRY MEN AND WOMEN TO LEAVE JEREMY CORBIN SHADOW CABINET IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE SHED A LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS BRYANT WENT ON TO SAY
IF YOU DO SO I BELIEVE FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL PRAISE YOUR SELFLESSNESS IF YOU REFUSED TO STEP ASIDE I FEEL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MAN WHO BROKE THE LABOUR PARTY LATE LAST NIGHT JEREMY CORBIN INSISTED THAT HE WOULD REMAIN AND NOT LEAVE HE SAID HE WOULD STAND AGAIN IF A NEW LEADERSHIP ELECTION WAS TRIGGERED WHAT DOES INSPIRED THIS REVOLT NOW IS A MIXTURE OF ANGER DISMAY AND FEAR
ANGER THAT MISTER CORBIN'S CAMPAIGNING FOR THE E.U. WAS HALF HEARTED DISMAY THAT SO MANY LABOUR AIR IS REJECTED THEIR PARTIES ADVICE HERE THAT AN EARLY GENERAL ELECTION COULD BE CALLED BY A NEW TORY PRIME MINISTER MY BINS BACK AS INSIST THE GRASSROOTS SUPPORT SWEPT INTO POWER LAST SUMMER IS STILL AS STRONG AS EVER AS EMILY HAS BEEN FINDING OUT IN NOTTINGHAM WHERE SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO PARTY MEMBERS
WELL I THINK THEY'RE NOT EVEN PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WAY SOLIDLY SUPPORTED CORBIN ANYWAY IN A CAFE IN NOTTINGHAM LOCAL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS DISCUSS THE CRISIS ENGULFING THEIR PARTY COMES IN SURPRISE AND FINALLY
THEY SEE THEIR RESIGNATIONS FROM THE SHADOW CABINET INCLUDING TWO LOCAL M.P.S LILLIAN GREENWOOD AND VERNON COCA AS WESTMINSTER MISCHIEF THEY'RE ACTIVISTS FOR MOMENTUM A GRASSROOTS ORGANISATION SET UP TO BACK JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP THEY INSIST SUPPORT FOR HIM IS STILL STRONG
ADELE WILLIAMS IS THE SECRETARY OF SHERWOOD LABOUR PARTY I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S CHANGED IN TERMS OF SUPPORT THE MANDATE FOR THE SPORT FOR JEREMY WITHIN THE PARTY REMAINS THE SAME WE HAD MANY OF THOSE NEW MEMBERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR OR BECOME ENGAGED AND ACTIVE MEMBERS WE'VE HAD IT WHEN WE'RE ALL OUT CAMPAIGNING ON THURSDAY
MANY OF THEM WERE NEW MEMBERS WHO WOULD COME TO YOU COME TO COME TO CAMPAIGN WITH US SO I'VE ABSENT I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT JEREMY'S MET AS MAINTAINED THE SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT THAT HE HAD WHEN HE WAS ELECTED ON A MASSIVE MONDAY BUT I'M A KAZMI ANOTHER MOMENTUM ACTIVIST AND LOCAL LABOUR MEMBER ADMIT SOME CORBIN SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS
I THINK OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS IT WAS IN THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER OF ENTHUSIASM AND SUPPORT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN BEFORE HE ACTUALLY TAKEN OFFICE SO BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S MASSIVELY DWINDLED IN THE FACE OF THIS REFERENDUM
HOWEVER THAT STRENGTH OF SUPPORT MAYBE MASKING DOUBTS AMONG MANY LOCAL PARTY MEMBERS I HAVE KEPT UP WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS ON FACEBOOK AND I HAVE SEEN
FROM PEOPLE ON THERE WHO YOU KNOW STRONGLY BACK JEREMY CORBIN WHO JOINED OUR PARTY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WANTED JEREMY IS THE LEADER AND YOU HAVE SAID YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SEE THIS MAN
STANDING ON THE STEPS OF NUMBER TEN
LINDA WEDDINGS A LABOUR COUNCILLOR WHO ISN'T PART OF THE MOMENTUM GROUP IS ONE OF THE FEW CONSTITUENCY PARTY MEMBERS WILLING TO PUT HER HEAD ABOVE THE PARAPET I WAS WANTING HIM TO DO WELL I WAS WILLING HIM TO DO WELL
I THOUGHT IT WAS FANTASTIC THAT WE HAD ALL THESE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE JOIN OUR PARTY AS WELL AND YOU KNOW MY REAL HOPE WAS THAT HE WOULD GALVANISE THOSE PEOPLE INTO ACTION BUT I THINK HE HAS FAILED TO SHOW ANY SIGNS OF LEADERSHIP
I'M A STRONG MESSAGE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING OUT TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO WE NEED IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TURN BACK AND VOTE LABOUR NO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS IN A MESS AT THE MOMENT IT MIGHT BE THE IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUR HOUSE IN ORDER
ALTHOUGH JEREMY CORBIN SAYS HE'LL FIGHT ON AND ALTHOUGH THOSE WHO BACK HIM REMAIN VOCAL THE GREAT SWATHE OF SUPPORT THAT SWEPT INTO POWER IS BEGINNING TO SHOW
WELL THEY'RE A LOT MORE THAN CRACKS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AT LEAST LUCY POWELL WAS THE SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY UNTIL SHE RESIGNED YESTERDAY AND SHE JOINED US ON THE LINE FROM SALFORD GOOD MORNING TO YOU LUCY GOOD MORNING I UNDERSTAND MORE RESIGNATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW IN THE IN THE NEXT HOUR WELL I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT THAT'S UP TO INDIVIDUAL COLLEAGUES BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF
UNHAPPINESS DISAPPOINTMENT DISQUIET AND CONCERN AMONGST MY COLLEAGUES AND MANY OF THEM NOW FEEL THAT THEY'RE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN JEREMY'S FRONT BENCH TEAM THIS IS NOT THERE A SERIES A COINCIDENCE IS IT IT'S A PLANNED COUP AGAINST YOUR LEADER
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT A PLANNED Q. YOU KNOW UP UNTIL SATURDAY AFTERNOON I WAS STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH JEREMY'S OFFICE AND OTHERS ABOUT RESEARCH I WAS RELEASING THIS WEEK ABOUT PLANNED I HAVE THIS WEEK TO EXPOSE THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUED FAILURE ON EDUCATION I'D JUST VERY YOUNG IF YOU DAYS AGO APPOINTED A NEW MEMBER OF STAFF YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT
I'VE NOW GOT TO SAY HE'S NOT GOT A JOB ANY MORE SO ALL OF THOSE WERE GETTING ON WITH OUR JOB ABOUT BEING EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION WHAT CHANGED WELL I THINK A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED FIRSTLY OBVIOUSLY THE SEISMIC RESULT OF THURSDAY A HUGE CHANGES NOW COMING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER THAT'S THROWN ALL THE BALLS IN THE AIR IN THE COUNTRY IS CRYING OUT FOR
STRONG AND EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP I THINK MANY OF US FELT THAT THAT STRONG AND EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP THAT IS LACKING IN JEREMY WAS BRUTALLY EXPOSED DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND THEN THE FINAL STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK FOR ME CERTAINLY AND I THINK FOR MANY OTHER COLLEAGUES WAS THAT JUST AT A TIME WHEN WE NEEDED STRONG LEADERSHIP TO UNITE AND BRING THE LABOUR PARTY TOGETHER AS THERE WERE CONCERNS BEING EXPRESSED IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY
THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY WAS CRUELLY AND NECESSARILY SACKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I THINK WHAT I THINK SHE CALLS UP HIS LEADER AND SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO QUIT IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING HE DOESN'T KEEP A PLACE IN THE SHADOW CABINET IS THAT THAT'S STANDARD STUFF WELL THAT'S ONE VERSION OF EVENTS BUT I THINK WHAT THE OTHER VERSION I'M NOT QUITE SURE IT'S AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THAT BUT I THINK WE NEEDED TO PULL TOGETHER
THAT HAS TO COME FROM THE TOP THAT IS WHAT LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT HOW DOES THIS AND COLLEAGUES ON BOARD IT'S ABOUT UNIFYING COLLEAGUES AND JEREMY'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR JEREMY I THINK HE'S GOT GOOD VALUES HE'S A DECENT MAN HE'S BROUGHT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BUT TO THE LABOUR PARTY IN SOME IN SOME REGARDS ESPECIALLY ON THE ECONOMY BUT I DON'T DO USUALLY CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW DO YOU SET UP A METRIC HOW DO YOU GET IT BECAUSE IT DOES LOOK LIKE THAT OLD PHRASE THE IMMOVABLE OBJECT IN THE UNSTOPPABLE FORCE
IN ANY CONVENTIONAL SITUATION POLITICALLY BEGUN BY NOW WITH THIS NUMBER OF RESIGNATIONS BUT YOUR RULES SAY STATE THAT IT'S THE MEMBERS THAT DECIDE THE MEMBERS BACKED HIM HE SAYS HE WON'T RESIGN SO HOW DO YOU EXPECT THIS TO PRODUCE ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHAOS AT A VACUUM WELL I REALLY DO HOPE THAT JEREMY WILL LOOK
REFLECT AND DEEP INTO HIMSELF AND ASK HIMSELF HAS HE GOT THAT DESIRE THAT ABILITY TO LEAD THAT CAN PULL THE LABOUR PARTY OUT OF THIS SITUATION BECAUSE THAT HAS TO COME FROM LEADERSHIP AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SUFFICIENT TO SAY WHILE I HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THEIR MEMBERS A LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY LEADER OF ANY POLITICAL PARTY HAS TO COMMAND
BOTH THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERSHIP AS WELL AS THE SUPPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LAND I DON'T WANT TO BE HIS DEPUTY TO FORGIVE ME DO YOU WANT TOM WATSON IS DEPUTY TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO HIM THIS MORNING AND HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO THINK THAT HE WILL I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT CLEAR TO JEREMY I I DID WHEN I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM YESTERDAY WHAT ABOUT TOM WANT ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOM'S GOING TO DISCUSS WITH WITH JEREMY THIS MORNING BUT I THINK IT IS NOW VERY CLEAR
THAT THE POSITION OF JEREMY AS THE HEAD OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY IS PRETTY UNTENABLE AND I HOPE THAT HE WOULD REFLECT ON THAT AND THIS THIS IS NOW A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE COUNTRY WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP
AND YET THE TREES USUALLY WITH THE OTHER CRUCIAL PLAYER IN THIS THE TRADE UNIONS ARE RALLYING TO MISTER CORBIN SIDE AND INDEED THEIR WARNING THE LIKES OF YOU THAT IF YOU CONTINUE WITH THIS THEY HAVE AN ANSWER THEY'LL DESELECT YOU THEY'LL STOP YOU BEING LABOUR CANDIDATES AT THE NEXT ELECTION WHENEVER ITSELF WELL I THINK CERTAIN SHE'LL PROBABLY GET ON WITH THEIR OWN JOBS AND LEAVE THE LABOUR PARTY TO LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES BUT
THAT DOESN'T CONCERN ME BUT I DON'T THINK HAVING EVEN MORE DIVISIVE LANGUAGE HERE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THOSE AROUND JEREMY I DON'T THINK THAT IS ACTUALLY REFLECTIVE OF JEREMY HIMSELF IS HELPFUL HERE OUI I DO NEED A UNITED TEAM WE NEED TO SHOW THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE GOT A STRONG ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTOOD WHY DOESN'T HE WANT TO GO FOR HOW LONG TO GIVE HIM A WEEK
WELL I YOU KNOW I REALLY DO HOPE THAT JEREMY WILL NOW REFLECT ON THIS HIMSELF DAYS ARE WE NOT NICE IF THAT NOT DRAG THIS OUT ANY ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY LUCY THANK YOU JOIN US THANK YOU IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND HISTORY CAN BE A USEFUL RESOURCE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT IN LET THE F.T. A CORRESPONDENT TURNED FOR HELP TO THE CLASSICS TACITUS RIGHT SIMON CROSBY REPORTS HOW THE BRITONS WOULD SEEK TO ESCAPE ROMANS BY WALKING INTO A BOG LAND UNTIL THEY WERE UP TO THEIR NECKS IN MUD
WE JUST DID IT AGAIN BUT SUPPORTERS ARE BRECHT ARE KEEN TO CONVEY A MUCH MORE POSITIVE MESSAGE LEO MCKINSTRY IN THE DAILY EXPRESS CALLS THE REFERENDUM RESULT AND INSPIRING WIN FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE BREAKS IT REPRESENTS A TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY OVER BUREAUCRACY AND OF NATION HOOD OVER FEDERALISM
BY CONTRAST THOUGH THE F.T. TALKS OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN THE STARK REALITY OF CRUMBLING INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD STAGE THE DAILY MIRROR HAS NO DOUBT THE BORIS JOHNSON IS THE RUNAWAY FAVOURITE TO SUCCEED MY CAMERON IT SAYS HE SPENT THE WEEKEND WOOING HIM PEAS AT HIS COUNTRY RETREAT THE DAILY MAIL COMMENTS AT THEIR FAVOURITE RARELY WINS THE TORY LEADERSHIP AND PREDICTS A FIERCE BATTLE WITH THERESA MAY BUT TREVOR GOVERNOR OF THE SUN SAYS LOVE HIM OR LOATHE HIM BORIS JOHNSON WILL BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER GET USED TO IT BRAND BORIS SAYS THE TIMES IS ALWAYS A WINNER
HE HAS SAYS SONIA PURNELL HIS BIOGRAPHER A JAW DROPPING GIFT FOR WINNING VOTES BUT THE DOING AFTERWARDS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINCT PROBLEM IS NOT WITHOUT ITS FLAWS IT'S CHRIS RIKER OFF DAVID IN THE DAVIES IN THE EXPRESS BUT HE THINKS BORIS IS A HUMAN MAGNATE WHOSE FORTHRIGHT HONESTY AND OPENNESS HAS EARNED THE PEOPLE'S TRUST MANY OF THE PAPERS HAVE THAN COMMENT ON PICTURES OF LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON DRINKING FROM A CAN OF CIDER AND HIS GUMBOOTS OR GLASTONBURY
THE EXPRESS THINKS HE SEEMED APPARENTLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE GATHERING CHAOS AND HIS PARTY HADLEY FREEMAN COVERING THE FESTIVAL FOR THE GUARDIAN FELT THE COUNTRY WAS FALLING APART WHEN SHE HAD THE REFERENDUM RESULT BUT STAYED ON AND FELT HEALED JAN MYER OF THE MALE THINK THE THINKS THE HIGHPOINT WAS PROVIDED BY ADELE SAYING SHE SEEMED AT TIMES LIKE A DRUNK ARTY ADVANCE AUNTIE ADVANCING ON THE KARAOKE MACHINE AT A WEDDING THEY GAVE
ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER GLASTONBURY PERFORMANCES FOR ME I'M A COMIC AT THE TELEGRAPH HER SET WAS AN EMOTIONAL HIGH BUT THE BEST EXPERIENCE WAS THE CALM AND CONTENT OF MUCKY REVELLERS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE MUD GLAMOROUS PICTURES OF THE BRITISH PLAYER YOU HAD A CONTO IN THE MALE CONFIRMED THE WIMBLEDON IS UPON US WONDERFUL ISN'T IT WONDERFUL EXPLAIN EXCLAIMS THE EXPRESS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT POLITICS ASIDE FOR A WHILE
IT'S NOW COMING UP TO QUARTER TO EIGHT ABUSIVE GRAFFITI SPRAYED ON THE POLISH COMMUNITY CENTRE OFFENSIVE LEAFLETS POSTED THROUGH LETTERBOXES DECLARING LEAVE THE E. YOU KNOW MORE PO LISH VERMIN HE'S NOT THE POLISH AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. IS CONDEMNED AS HATE MOTIVATED ATTACKS THE CHAIR OF THE POLAR SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ASSOCIATION IS JOHAN EMILY TINKER
WE WERE VERY DISTURBED AND UPSET THIS MORNING TO FIND REALLY UNPLEASANT GRAFFITI ALL ACROSS THE FRONT OF OUR BUILDING WHEN I STOP OH THE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING IT AS A RACIALLY MOTIVATED CRIME
BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY MOVED AND EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO BE A LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND M.P.S AND ON NEIGHBOURS WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE U.K. CORRESPOND WITH THE POLISH PRESS AGENCY YAKULT KRUPA GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
HAS SOME OF THIS HATE CRIME BEING GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AND WHICH IS NOTICING IT NOW OR IS THERE A DISTINCT CHANGED YOU THINKING WHAT'S HAPPENED IN RECENT DAYS AND WEEKS I THINK THERE'S A DISTINCT CHANGE NOW WE'VE SEEN MORE OF THEIR OBVIOUSLY OTHER PEOPLE WOULD FADE OUT THE DISNEY BREWING UNDERNEATH IT FOR MANY MANY MONTHS OF THE RING TO COMPLAIN ESPECIALLY BUT NOW WE CAN SEE THE FULL OF
A RESULT OF THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO OURS WE'VE SEEN REPORTS AND HAD REPORTS OF PEOPLE BEING VERBALLY ABUSED ACROSS THE COUNTRY MANY PLACES SO THIS IS NOW PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS ON THE STREETS IN THEIR OWN HOMES BEING DIRECTLY TARGETED WHICH MUST BE CAUSING DEEP DISTRESS IN THE POST GO ABSOLUTE YES WE DID A POLL BEFORE THE REFERENDUM AND FORTY PERCENT OF POST LIVING YOU KAY SAID THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT NEGATIVE SENTIMENT TOWARDS BOTH IF THERE IS A BREAKFAST AND I UNDERSTAND THE STAMBOUL POSSIBLY BE EVEN HIGHER AFTER THE VOTE THAT BECAUSE OF THE
THINGS WE'VE SEEN HIM WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OF LATH ONLY TWO HOURS FOR SETTING A LOT OF CONCERN I SPOKE OF PAUL'S YESTERDAY AT THE POST SOCIAL AND CARDS FOR THE BUILDING THAT WAS ATTACKED BY THE GRAFFITI AND LOADS OF PEOPLE SAY WE'VE WE HAVE EXPERIENCE AT OURSELVES WE KNOW ABOUT IT WE HEARD ABOUT THAT I DID FOR MY FRIENDS FOR THEY HAVE THOSE WE'D BE CONFIRMING THE COMMUNITY IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY FROM WHAT YOU'VE HEARD WHETHER THIS IS HIGHLY ORGANISED BY SMALL EXTREMIST GROUPS
OR MORE ALARMING STILL WHETHER IT'S A KIND OF RANDOM SERIES OF OF ABUSE AND ATTACKS BY ORDINARY IN INVERTED COMMAS MEMBERS THE PUP I THINK IT'S MORE THE I THINK IT'S ABOUT RANDOM SITUATION OF PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY GO AND ABUSE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WHO WOULD NOT DO NOT EXPECT THAT
IN SO MANY PLACES DIFFERENT PLACE ACROSS THE U.K. SO LONG THING THAT THING ORGANISE FINGER THINGS RANDOM SITUATION AGAIN THAT MAKES IT MORE DISTRESSING DOESN'T IN A SENSE HARDER TO DEAL WITH IF YOU'RE NOT SIMPLY SAYING CRACKDOWN ON A COUPLE OF EXTREME BROOKED ABSOLUTELY YES A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY NOW WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR NEIGHBOURS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE WE'VE SEEN BEFORE NOW THEY ABUSING US OFF THE REFERENDUM AND I THINK THERE'S A VERY BIG CONCERN ABOUT IT THEN WE SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING AND CACKLING AT US ENOUGH POSSIBLE
NOW THE PERISHER MASTER I QUOTED HAS CALLED ON POLITICIANS TO CONTEND THIS WHAT ELSE IS BEING ASKED FOR IN THE POLISH COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE CLIMATE CHANGES OBVIOUSLY OLD PAUL'S ARE BEING ASKED TO CONTACT THE KIND OF THE LOCAL M.P. EASTON TO GO IN PERSON TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE AND HOW
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT THIS IS ALSO A KEY THING A LOT OF DISCORD OF CRIMES GO AND REPORT IT SO PEOPLE DON'T RECORD THAT THE POLICE I THINK IT'S CRUCIAL ALSO MAKE REASSURE THE POLISH COMMUNITY IF YOU EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT POLICE REPORT THAT THE POLICE ON TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE BITS BEING THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED ON YAKKA KRUPA THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US FROM THE POLISH PRESS AGENCY
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO IT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN LONDON THIS MORNING IS FRANCIS CAMPBELL WHO'S VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING NICK
THE QUESTION ABOUT OUR ROLE IN THE WORLD AND FURTHER WE WANT TO BE IN THE E.U. ARE NOT HAS THROWN UP AN INTERNAL QUESTION ABOUT THE COHESIVENESS OF OUR OWN SOCIETY
THE DIVISIONS RUN DEEP AND ARE QUITE EMOTIONAL COMPOUNDED BY GEOGRAPHIC NATIONAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY ALSO SEEMS PITTED AGAINST DIRECT DEMOCRACY NONE OF THESE DIVISIONS WILL BE EASILY RESOLVED ORAN HEARST
HAVING REPRESENTED THE UNITED KINGDOM AS A DIPLOMAT FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS I'VE SEEN SIMILAR SITUATIONS AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND REPORTED BACK TO LONDON AND CRISES AND UPHEAVAL
AND MY VIEW WHEN FACED WITH TIMES OF TENSION ON CERTAINTY AND DONNIE'S DIPLOMACY IS ALWAYS PREFERABLE TO DOGMATIC OR DICTATORIAL BEHAVIOUR EVEN IF THERE IS A PART OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT CRAVES CERTAINTY
RICE JUDGEMENT SIAN LLOYD VOICES RARELY CAPTURE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CHALLENGE BRING HEALING OR SOLVE THE PROBLEM
A RISK IN THIS FAST MOVING SCENARIO IS THAT WE ACT BEFORE WE THINK AND FIND OURSELVES SLEEPWALKING INTO AN EVER MORE DEVICE OF SOCIETY WHICH FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME
SO HOW DO WE PAUSE AND IT'S THE PRESSURE OF THE QUICKENED THE INSTANT AND A PISS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT SEEMS TO CHANGE BY THE HOUR A GOOD STARTING POINT IS THE QUESTION WHICH THE LAWYER OPPOSED TO G. SUS WHO IS MY NEIGHBOUR
THAT QUESTION RESONATES WITH US PARTICULARLY TODAY AS WE ASK IT WAS IN THE U.K. AND WITHIN OUR CONTINENT AND WORLD
JESUS' RESPONSE TO THE LAWYER WAS TO TELL HIM THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN WHO HELPED THE STRANGER WHILE TWO OTHERS SIMPLY WALKED PAST ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LAWYER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MAN WHO SHOWED MERCY AND COMPASSION TO THE STRANGER WAS THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR SHE SAYS THEN INSTRUCTED HIM TO DO THE SAME
SO WHO ARE WE IN THIS PARABLE THE VICTIM THOSE WHO WALKED PAST OR THE ONE WHO STOPPED AND HELP
THE ANSWER IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE STORY SHOWS US HOW WE CAN OVERCOME DIVISIONS AND REBUILD A COHESIVE SOCIETY IF YOU THINK IT'S ALL TOO DIFFICULT IT ISN'T
THIRTY YEARS AGO IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND IT'S TO HIGHLY DIVIDED AND VIOLENT SOCIETY ONE M.P. JOHN WHOM BRAVELY REACHED OUT TAKING HUGE RISKS TO SPEAK WITH THOSE WHO THEN BELIEVED IN PURSUING VIOLENCE TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL ENDS
IN DOING SO HE PERSUADED THEM TO ABANDON VIOLENCE AND TO EMBRACE DEMOCRATIC MEANS ALONE IT IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF PEACEMAKING AND BRIDGE BUILDING AND A LIFETIME BUILDING COMMUNITY CAN BE DONE EVEN WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM SO DEVICE OF LONDON POSSIBLE IT JUST REQUIRES GOOD SAMARITANS AND MORE PEOPLE LIKE JOHN HUME TO STOP TO THINK AND THEN I
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE TIME NOW IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW JUST SINCE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP THERE HAVE BEEN MORE RESIGNATIONS THREE SHADOW MINISTERS NOT IN THE SHADOW CABINET DIANA JOHNSON WAS SHOT A FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER HAS QUIT ANNA TURLEY THE SHADOW CIVIL SOCIETY MINISTER TOBY PERKINS THE SHADOW ARMED FORCES MINISTER NEIL COYLE HAS GONE TO AND LABOUR'S HOUSING AND PLANNING SPOKESWOMAN SAYS SHE WILL GO IF MISTER CORBIN DOES NOT HER NAME IS ROBERTA PLOUGHMAN WOODS
IT'S NOT JUST THE U.K. THAT'S BEEN PLUNGED INTO CHAOS SINCE A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE STRUGGLING TO KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE RESULT GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS ON AND ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER MATTEO WRENS E. WILL BE MEETING TODAY SO HOW WILL THEY APPROACH THE RENEGOTIATION OF OUR MEMBERSHIP
EXIT AND WHEN WILL THOSE TALKS START FROM IN THE LAST HOUR I SPOKE TO MICHAEL FOLKS IS THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF ANGULAR MERKEL'S PARTY THE C.D.U. I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE VISION SET OUT BY BORIS JOHNSON IN HIS DAILY TELEGRAPH ARTICLE TODAY THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
IT WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
SO WE COULD PAY WE COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET COULD WE ALSO THOUGH IF WE DID THAT RESTRICT IMMIGRATION
SO THERE WILL BE IT MAY NOT BE FREE MOVEMENT BUT IT BROKE
WE WOULD HAVE MORE CONTROL THAN WE HAVE NOW MOST PROBABLY BUT IT GAME THIS IS A NEGOTIATION YOU CANNOT SAY IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS BUT IT HAS TO BE NEGOTIATED EVERYTHING HAD TO BE NEGOTIATED AND THOSE NEGOTIATIONS STRICTLY SPEAKING FORMALLY START ONCE ARTICLE S'EST D. IS TRIGGERED AND THAT WON'T HAPPEN TILL OCTOBER
ARE YOU HIS GERMANY JUST ACCEPTING OF THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN IN THE U.K.
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING SCARED AND BAD FOR BUSINESSES IN THE E. THE REST OF THE E.U. OR IN THE U.K.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE LEADING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS MAYBE COME ON IT WAS SOMETHING YOU CAN ADJUST THEIR OWN UPPINGHAM BUT IN NUMBER TEN DOWNING STREET AND TO LET OTHER PEOPLE BOGBEAN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NO IT'S NOT
SO YOU WOULD CALL ON DAVID CAMERON TO GO BACK ON WHAT HE SAID LAST WEEK HAD AND INSTEAD START THE TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AND START THE NEGOTIATIONS YOU CAN'T FORCE HIS HAND THOUGH CAN YOU ON THIS
DO YOU THINK THAT E.U. LEADERS WOULD LOOK LESS FAVOURABLY ON THE NEGOTIATIONS PERHAPS BE MORE PREPARED TO PUNISH THE U.K. THE LONGER THIS GOES ON
THERE SHOULD BE B.T. O.K. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PRACTICE WAS SO MANY YEARS SO SOMEBODY NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO ULTIMATELY HOW DO YOU SEE IT'S WORKING OUT THAT WE DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WE DO YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER OUR IMMIGRATION BUT WE ARE PAYING FOR THAT

GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS WARNED THAT IT WILL NOT BE PLAIN SAILING FOLLOWING THE E.U. REFERENDUM BUT INSISTED THE U.K. ECONOMY WAS EQUIPPED FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP IS CANDY COMING UNDER MORE PRESSURE WITH FURTHER RESIGNATION IT'S EXPECTED FROM HIS SHADOW MINISTERIAL TEAM
AND COLDPLAY ENDED THE MUDDIEST GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL EVER WITH A SURPRISE TRIBUTE TO THE BEE GEES WITHOUT IN THE REST OF THE B.B.C. NEWS CHARLES CARROLL THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS SOUGHT TO CALM THE TURMOIL THAT'S HIT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS FOLLOWING BRITAIN'S VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN A STATEMENT AT THE TREASURY IN THE PAST HOUR HE SAID THE U.K. ECONOMY WOULD NEED TO ADJUST TO THEIR DECISION BUT INSISTED THAT IT WOULD DO SO FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND THAT ROBUST CONTINGENCY PLANS WERE IN PLACE
IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE THE REFERENDUM MY OSBORNE SAID THAT HE STOOD BY THE CONCERNS HE'D EXPRESSED WHILE CAMPAIGNING TO STAY IN THE E.U. BUT THAT HE ACCEPTED THE RESULT AND WOULD NOW DO ALL HE COULD TO STABILISE THE ECONOMY FROM THE TREASURY HERE'S OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMO AHMED
AFTER THREE DAYS OF SILENCE THE CHANCELLOR EMERGED TO MAKE HIS FIRST PUBLIC STATEMENT TRYING TO REASSURE THE MARKETS YES I WARNED OF ECONOMIC CHAOS AHEAD IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E. U. BUT NOW IT IS TIME TO PULL TOGETHER
GEORGE OSBORNE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND FINANCE MINISTERS AROUND THE WORLD TO ENSURE THAT COORDINATED FIND MITZI WAS AVAILABLE IF FRESH FEAR GRIPS THE MARKETS TODAY
NO ONE SHOULD DOUBT OUR RESOLVE TO MAINTAIN THE FISCAL STABILITY WE HAVE DELIVERED FOR THIS COUNTRY
AND TWO COMPANIES LARGE AND SMALL I WOULD SAY THIS
THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG WE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE ARE OPEN FOR BUSINESS
THE CHANCELLOR SAID THERE WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC HIT FROM THE REFERENDUM BUT ANY EMERGENCY BUDGET WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL THERE WAS A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN THE AUTUMN TURNING TO HIS OWN FUTURE MISTER OSBORNE SAID HE WOULD COMMENT ON THAT IN THE COMING DAYS BUT THAT NOW WAS A TIME FOR STABILITY
THE I.M.F. HAS SAID THAT CENTRAL BANKS HAVE TAKEN APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO SHORE UP GLOBAL MARKETS BUT THE LEVEL OF RISK WOULD DEPEND ON POLITICIANS STERLING FELL INITIALLY ON THE MARKET IN ASIA BUT STOCKS IN JAPAN AND CHINA RECOVERED SLIGHTLY EARLY TRADING IN LONDON HAS REMAINED VOLATILE FROM THE CITY ARE BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC O'CONNELL
AS EXPECTED GEORGE OSBORNE MADE NO BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS HIS JOB THIS MORNING WAS TO BE BLAND AND ABOVE ALL REASSURING HAVING WARNED OF THE DIRE DANGERS OF BRICKS AT DURING THE CAMPAIGN TODAY HE POINTED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WHICH WAS HE SAID THE STRONGEST OF ALL THE DEVELOPED NATIONS
BUT HE SAID MUCH WOULD DEPEND UPON THE FINAL SHAPE OF BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE AND WITH THE FUTURE OF THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP UNCERTAIN THE NATURE OF THAT RELATIONSHIP IS STILL UNCERTAIN
DAVID TINSLEY YOU KEN EUROPEAN ECONOMIST AT YOU B'S TO THAT LONG PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY WOULD BE DAMAGING
THEY'RE ALL ON DIFFERENT TIME LINES AND OF COURSE AMONGST ALL OF THIS TO U.K. ECONOMY WE EXPECTING MOST COMMENTATORS EXPECT WILL BE WEAKENING AS THE TREASURY WARNED BEFORE THE VOTE SO WELL THE CHANCELLOR'S STOCK MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE TOO HIGH AT THE MOMENT IN IN SOME CONSTITUENCIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SIX MONTHS IF THE ECONOMY DOES DECELERATE SHARPLY THAT PICTURE ITSELF COULD CHANGE QUITE A LOT AS WELL
STERLING FELL OVERNIGHT AND ASIAN MARKETS BY THREE PER CENT IN A POUND IS NOW WORTH ONE DOLLAR THIRTY FOR MANY IN THE CITY WILL BE HOPING THAT OSBORNE'S WORDS CAN STOP THE ROT
ONE OF THE LEADING FIGURES IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR PRANKS IT BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH HE SAYS HE STILL BELIEVES BRITAIN WILL BE ABLE TO RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHILE RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION THE CABINET WILL MEET THIS MORNING AND DAVID CAMERON WILL GIVE A STATEMENT TO THE COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORT
AFTER A WEEKEND OF SILENCE BORIS JOHNSON THIS MORNING SETS UP TO REASSURE VOTERS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF BRECHT SAID INSISTING THERE IS EVERY CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM HE ALSO SEEKS TO REACH OUT TO THOSE WHO VOTED REMAIN ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR DISMAY AND ANXIETY SIGNIFICANTLY HOWEVER MY JOHNSON ALSO SEEKS TO PLAY DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMIGRATION IN THE REFERENDUM
HE SUGGESTS BRITAIN WILL RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO PRAISE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY AND BY IMPLICATION THE CHANCELLOR SAYING THE ECONOMY IS IN GOOD HANDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT STANCE TO THAT TAKEN DURING THE REFERENDUM MEANWHILE NUMBER TEN HAVE DISMISSED CLAIMS OF OR GET BORIS CAMPAIGN MY JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY ARE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE LATER THIS WEEK THAT THEY WILL STAND FOR THE LEADERSHIP
IT'S UNDERSTOOD MY CAMERON HASN'T SPOKEN TO BORIS JOHNSON'S SINCE THE REFERENDUM HOWEVER DOWNING STREET SOURCES INSIST THERE WILL BE NO RECRIMINATIONS AND THE PRIME MINISTER WILL REMAIN ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN THE LEADERSHIP CONTEST
LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON HAS SAID THAT HE'LL MEET JEREMY CORBIN TODAY TO DISCUSS THE WAY FORWARD AFTER THE REBELLION BY SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET ELEVEN OF THE PARTY'S FRONT BENCH STOOD DOWN YESTERDAY FOLLOWING THE SACKING OF HILARY BENN AND WITHIN THE PAST FEW MINUTES FOR JUNIORS SHADOW MINISTERS HAVE RESIGNED BUT LAST NIGHT MY ISSUED A STATEMENT INSISTING THAT HE WOULD FIGHT ANY CHALLENGE TO HIS LEADERSHIP HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN

IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THOSE SEEKING TO DEPOSE MISTER CORBIN HAVE SETTLED ON A RIVAL CANDIDATE TO GALVANISE SUPPORT DESPITE HER BELIEF EXPRESSED BY SOME M.P.S THAT BACKING FOR MISTER CORBIN THEY HAVE COOLED AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF THE PARTY LEADER HAS MADE CLEAR HIS INTENTION TO REBUILD HIS SHADOW CABINET SAYING HE WILL MAKE NEW APPOINTMENTS IN THE COMING HOURS LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON IS EXPECTED TO HOLD TALKS WITH MISTER CORBIN ON THE MEETING OF M.P.S TONIGHT WILL DISCUSS A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN MISTER CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP

THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS CAN'T START TILL WE HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER BUT WE CANNOT HAVE A FOUR MONTH PERIOD DURING WHICH NOTHING HAPPENS WE'VE GOT TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT WHAT CREED RELATIONSHIP WHAT RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT ARE WE PREPARED TO GIVE WHAT WE WANT WHERE ARE WE ON FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WHICH IS SUCH A PIVOTAL ISSUE
BORIS JOHNSON TO SAY OR WE DIDN'T MEAN IT ABOUT IMMIGRATION THAT SOMEHOW IT THINGS AND CARRY ON THE ENTIRE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN WAS BASED ON SCARES ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND FRAUDULENT DOING THIS WE CANNOT WAIT FOR FOUR MONTHS I'M NOT DISCUSS THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL JUST LOOK IN AMAZEMENT HOW IS THE UNITED KINGDOM COME TO THIS POSITION WE HAVE TAKEN THIS DECISION AND WE HAVE NO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE ARE YOU NOT OVERDOING THE GLOOM PERISH THE THOUGHT THAT MY WOULD NEVER BE ACCUSED OF SUCH A THING
BUT BORIS JOHNSON SAYS AT THIS COLUMN TODAY THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ARE BEING WILDLY OVERDONE THE STOCK MARKET HE POINTS OUT IS ABOVE ITS LEVEL OF LAST AUTUMN THE POUND IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN SO YES UNCERTAIN TIMES BUT NOT THE CALAMITY THAT YOU AND OTHERS ONE HORNY OFF LOOK AT THAT WHERE WAS THAT TURBULENCE ON FRIDAY THERE'LL BE MORE I SUSPECT IN THE DAYS AHEAD BUT FOR BORIS JOHNSON SEEM TO BE TREATING THIS LIKE A BIG GAME
BUT THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WERE JUST A JOLLY LAUGH YOU KNOW IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER AND NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE WE HAVE VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE TO DISENTANGLE WHOLE BODY OF RAW WE'VE GOT HAVE NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT AS THE ENORMITY OF THE DECISION SINKS IN NOT JUST AT HOME BUT FOR THOSE WHO TRADE WITH US THOSE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH US ACROSS THE WORLD THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR PLAN IS WHAT YOU WERE MOST WORRIED ABOUT HIS WORLD FORGOT IF YOU INTERRUPT HIM WHAT ARE YOU MOST WORRIED ABOUT IN THE SHORT TERM
IS IT THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME TERRIBLE RUM IN THE MARKET IS IT THE POSTPONEMENT OF THOSE INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHAT IN OTHER WORDS YOU PEOPLE AT HOME THINKING ABOUT THIS TODAY BE MOST CONCERNED LOOKED IN THE SHORT TERM YOU KNOW THE U.K. GOVERNMENT ALWAYS HAS CONTINGENCY PLANS OF THE CHANCELLOR WAS SAYING THIS MORNING TO DO IT TO DO WITH THAT AND THE BAR BANKS FOR A MUCH STRONGER POSITION THAN THEY WERE SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO
WHAT I'M BOTHERED ABOUT ARE TWO THINGS YOU MENTIONED THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS WERE A LOT OF THEM WILL BE PUT ON HOLD ON THE RISK IS A LONGER THERE'S UNCERTAINTY PEOPLE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT THEIR MONEY THEIR INVESTMENT IN THEREFORE JOBS ELSEWHERE WHAT I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS GAP BETWEEN KNOWN AT ALL BUT WHEN WE'LL HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IF WE DON'T DO SOME SERIOUS THINKING ABOUT WHAT HER OPTIONS ARE WE DON'T START ENGAGING WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF
THEN YOU CAN BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO THE RISK IS WE MAKE A BAD SITUATION WORSE AND WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT IF YOU LEAVE A VACUUM AND POLITICS WE'VE GOT ALL THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY THAT IS WHERE THE TROUBLE STARTS ALASTAIR DARLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRIS GRAYLING JOINS US NOW IS THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WILL BE SITTING WITH OTHER MINISTERS AROUND THE CABINET TABLE HE WILL BE ONE OF A FEW WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE MORNING TO YOU MISTER GREYLING HELLO
WE'RE NOT ENTITLED TO HAVE A PLAN FROM THOSE OF YOU WHO SAID YOU WANTED TO GET OUT THERE ISN'T ONE AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THE WHOLE POINTS THE CABINET WILL MEET IN AN HOUR'S TIME WHAT ALISTAIR DARLING HE'S JUST SAID HE'S RIGHT WE CAN'T SIT DOING NOTHING FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS WE WILL START WORK ON THEIR PREPARATIONS WE WILL START WORK ON ESTABLISHING THE TEAMS FOR NEEDS ACROSS THE PERIOD WHILE WE'RE ELECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER NONETHELESS TO BE A DETAILED PLAN
PUT IN PLACE FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE WAS THERE SURE DOES BUT I MEAN LET'S JUST ANALYSE THE WORDS YOU'VE UTTERED YOU WILL START WORK ON ESTABLISHING THE TEAM TO DRAW UP A PLAN SO WE'VE TAKEN THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC DECISION IN THIS COUNTRY ARGUABLY FOR HALF A CENTURY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO START WORK ON WHO MIGHT ONE DAY TELL US WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT WHO WE'VE GOT A VERY CLEAR VIEW ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THERE DOES NEED TO BE AN INFORMAL PERIOD
WHEN WE DO PUT IN PLACE THE THINGS THAT WE WILL NEED FOR THE FORMAL NEGOTIATION WHERE WE DO HAVE INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DON'T WE PAY MINISTERS TO DRAW UP A PLAN IN ADVANCE AND DON'T WE EXPECT PEOPLE WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR LEAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE DAY AFTER YOU WIN WEATHER HAS ALREADY BEEN THINKING DONE BY THE CIVIL SERVICE AS WE KNOW BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS AND PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE FROM THE POINT OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN I'M PRETTY CLEAR MY MIND WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO END UP I THINK WE NEED A FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHICH INCLUDE ALLOWS US TO CONTROL THE FLOW OF PEOPLE INTO AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY OH K. IS AN INTERESTING POINT BORIS JOHNSON TALKED TODAY ABOUT GETTING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET I THOUGHT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAD BEEN CLEAR YOU DID NOT WISH TO BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET UP TILL NOW WE NOW SING YOU'D QUITE LIKE TO BE PART WE HOPE TO HAVE NONE OF THE COSTS AND NONE OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF BEING IN IT
THE SINGLE MARKET IS A PHRASE WHAT MATTERS IS THAT BRITISH COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE A PRODUCT OR THAT TO LIVE FOR A SERVICE CAN CONTINUE TO SELL THAT PRODUCT OR SERVICE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW THE REALITY IS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONFIDENT THAT WILL TAKE PLACE FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS OF COURSE WE SELL AROUND THE WORLD EVEN IN PLACES WHERE WE HAD NO TREASURE NOT ESTATES IS OUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVING TO TRADE WITH THEM AT ALL
BUT WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE THEIR BIGGEST CUSTOMER SURE BUT THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN BUT THERE IS NO COUNTRY ON THE PLANET THAT HAS FULL ACCESS LET'S USE THE WORDS PORTLY FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT EITHER PAYING SOME OF THE BUDGET OR TAKING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT SO I JUST TO BE CLEAR TO DO IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE MIGHT BE PREPARED TO PAY SOME OF THE BUDGET AND WE MIGHT BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME FORM OF FREE MOVEMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
ACCESS THAT'S THE KEY POINT IS THAT IT COMES DOWN TO THAT SIMPLE PREMISE IF I AM A COMPANY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM PRODUCING A PRODUCT WOULD I BE ABLE TO SELL THAT TARIFF FREE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IF I AM DELIVERING A SERVICE WILL I BE ABLE TO DELIVER THAT SERVICE IN EUROPE AND IN FACT TODAY THERE IS NO SINGLE MARKET IN SERVICES FOR BRITISH COMPANIES CONTINUE TO DELIVER SERVICES AROUND THE EUROPEAN UNION AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A ONE WAY PROCESS HE KEEPS BEING CHARACTERISED IN TERMS OF
OUR ACCESS TO THEIR MARKETS WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'VE ALREADY HAD THE GERMAN C.B.I. SAYING VERY CLEARLY THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CURRENT TRADING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AT REMAIN IN PLACE BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR INTEREST DEBTORS ARE USUALLY SEEN AS A MAJOR ECONOMIC PROBLEM TO BE RATHER THAN SOMETHING TO BOAST ABOUT BUT I MEAN I THINK IT IS AND YOU CANNOT O.K. PROBLEM FOR US AND THAT'S ONE REASON WE NEED BETTER TRADE DEALS AROUND THE WORLD AND OF COURSE IT IS NOT BALANCED BY MONEY COMING INTO THE COUNTRY IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL OF FLOWS THEN IT'S AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM LET'S MOVE ON TO IMMIGRATION OVER THE WEEKEND WE LEARN FROM A VERY PROMINENT LEAVE CAMPAIGN
DAN HANNAN THAT APPARENTLY IMMIGRATION MAY NOT BE CUT AFTER ALL YOU WANTED CONTROL BUT THAT CONTROL WOULD NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO A CUP MY JOHNSON SAYS IN HIS COLUMN TODAY HE DOESN'T IMMIGRATION IS THE MAIN REASON PEOPLE VOTED FOR LEAVE IT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SAY WHAT I THINK IS THAT THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY A LOT OF THINGS AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE MOVED BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN PERIOD THESE ARE MATTERS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND FOR PARLIAMENT TO DECIDE AND THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN WE HAVE A VERY BIG PRIZE THERE IF THEY WERE NOT A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN IMMIGRATION
YES I THINK WE'VE ALL GOT A VERY CLEAR MANDATE FROM THE BRITISH PUBLIC TO PUT IN PLACE CONTROLS ON THE FLOW OF PEOPLE INTO THIS COUNTRY AND THAT WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN IT'S SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE EXPECTED TO DELIVER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SOMEONE DOES THE N.H.S. GET THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS PER WEEK WELL WE WON'T HAVE THE MONEY SPARE UNTIL AFTER HE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WHEN WE'VE LEFT THAT WILL BE MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WILL HAVE AN INFORMAL PERIOD LASTING A FEW MONTHS WE DON'T HAVE A NEGOTIATION UP TILL THE END OF A TWO YEAR PERIOD THAT'S WHAT SET OUT TO LISBON TREATY
MY EXPECTATIONS WE WILL HAVE COMPLETED THIS PROCESS IN GOOD TIME BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION IT'S IN SUMMARY ISN'T THE ANSWER THAT ALL THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WERE PROMISED THEY GET MORE MONEY FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE MUCH LOWER IMMIGRATION THEY MIGHT GET THEY MIGHT NOT DEPENDS WHO'S IN GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE MANY YEARS MAY NEVER HAPPEN BUT SAID IT WILL TAKE TIME AND THE REASON IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME BECAUSE CHRIS THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY THE SEVENTY MILLION WHO VOTED TO LEAVE THE SIXTEEN MILLION WHO VOTED TO REMAIN WE'LL ALL EXPECT US NOW TO DO THIS CAREFULLY IN THE RIGHT WAY FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM IT'S GOT IS WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS WELL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE CAMERA QUITE SUIT LET'S HEAR WHAT OUR THOUGHTS THEIR THOUGHTS UM SORRY HAVE A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COULDN'T BEG ON THAT IN A MOMENT LAUREL ASK ABOUT LABOUR AS WELL ROUND THE CABINET TABLE TODAY THEM SOME FORM OF PROCESS BEGINS TO BE DRAWN UP FOR BRICKS
INDEED IT DOES AND WHO WOULDN'T WRITE AN ENORMOUS CHEQUE TO BE ABLE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL AT THAT MEETING THIS MORNING MY GOODNESS THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY WILL OR REV BEEN ROUND YOUR TABLE SINCE THE END OF THIS VERY BRUISING CAMPAIGN AND IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO DISCUSS THE STEPS AHEAD GET THE CAMERA WILL BE ON HIS FEET IN THE HOUSE YOU CORONERS SEVERAL
THIS AFTERNOON I AM BARON WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO START GETTING A TASTE OF WHAT IT MEANS BUT THERE IS A CONSENSUS NOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN FIRST ARE INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES NOT AS THE PRIME MINISTER REPEATEDLY WARNED AN IMMEDIATE TRIGGER OF ARTICLE FIFTY THE TECHNICAL PROCESS HE WILL BE GOING OFF TO BRUSSELS TOMORROW TO MEET E.U. LEADERS AGAIN WHAT AN EMBARRASSING THING TO HAVE TO TURN UP AND SAY A WHOOPS GUYS DIDN'T QUITE GO AS I EXPECTED IT TO BUT HE WILL NOT TRIGGER THE FORMAL NEGOTIATION PROCESS
AND I'M AFRAID FOR MOST OF THAT THAT'S THAT MEANS THAT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS WERE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE DARK I JUST ONE QUICK THOUGHT ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS NOW IS THEY WERE A CROSS PARTY GROUP THEY DIDN'T ALL AGREE ON WHAT LIFE OUTSIDE THE E.U. WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY NOW THEY CAN'T TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO FOR IN NEGOTIATIONS LET ALONE WHAT WILL ACTUALLY GET IT
NOW WE MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR MORE LABOUR RESIGNATIONS EITHER WHO KILLED THROUGH ALL THE NAMES WHO ARE PERHAPS NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES EVEN IN THEIR OWN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE DOES IT END LAURA BECAUSE IF JEREMY CORBIN SAYS I'M NOT GOING IF HE HAS UNION BACKING AND IF HE HAS THE BACKING OF MEMBERS TO SURELY HE CAN SURVIVE
INDEED AND I THINK WHERE THIS PROBABLY ENDS IS A LEADERSHIP CONTEST NOT A FORCED RESIGNATION LATE LAST NIGHT JEREMY COLEMAN IS WELL AWARE OF HOW SERIOUS THIS IS BUT ALSO ABSOLUTELY DUG INTO HIS POSITION HIS TEAM BELIEVE THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY BELIEVE THEREFORE IF THERE'S A CONTEST WELL AND ASSESS BRING IT ON IT MIGHT CLEAR THE AREA WOULD JEREMY CORBIN PRAT ACTUALLY STRENGTHENED IN HIS JOB EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT SOUND PRETTY STRANGE TO PEOPLE AT WESTMINSTER THIS MORNING
BUT HERE IS THIS THING AND PEAS I'M NOW STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THEIR MEMBERS SUPPORT SOFTENING THE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT REMEMBER SENDING AN EMAIL SOME OF THEM OVER THE LAST WEEKEND SAYING THAT THEY BELIEVE ACTUALLY THEY LIKE JEREMY CORBIN VOTED FOR HIM LAST SUMMER ABOUT ACTUALLY THEY'VE SEEN OVER TIME PARTICULARLY THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT HE MAY NOT BE UP FOR THIS JOB LAURA JEREMY CORBETT'S TEAM THINKS HE STILL DOES HAVE THE MEMBERSHIP SUPPORT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH THAT WILL HAVE SOFTENED OVER THE RECENT DAYS
LAWRENCE BACK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE'VE HAD A LOT IN THE LAST THREE DAYS ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE REGRET THE WAY THEY VOTED IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM OR SERVE ASIAN POLL FOR THE DAILY MAIL SUGGEST SEVEN PER CENT OF THOSE WHO VOTED OUT WISH THEY HAD NOT DONE SO
BUT IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT FOUR PERCENT OF THOSE WHO VOTED TO REMAIN REGRET THEIR VOTE TOO WELL BY THOSE FIGURES IF THERE WAS A SECOND VOTE IT WOULD NOT CHANGE THE RESULT BUT IT WOULD SLASH THE MARGIN OF VICTORY FROM ONE POINT TWO MILLION TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BARBARA ANN'S DEL REGRETS VOTING OUT JENNA SHARP AND DOESN'T AND THEY BOTH JOIN ME ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING MORNING BARBARA WHY DO YOU REGRET YOUR DECISION TO VOTE OUT
UM I WAS
BECAUSE MANY MANY YEARS AGO I VOTED IT ONE MORE THING STANDARD IS OVER AND I DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN SO YOU VOTED IN BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT WAS A PROTEST VOTE DID YOU NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECT OF THE REFERENDUM TO BE OUT NOW AND
AND WHEN DID YOU THINK WHEN WAS THE FEELING THAT WHEN DID YOU START THE REGRET THE FEELING OF REGRET
ANDREW TIBET TOLD O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEN WHAT WHAT DID YOU FEEL SICK
I KNOW YOUR SON SPOKE TO YOU AS WELL I THINK HE WASN'T ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH YOUR BOAT NO NO HE WAS UM SO WELL IT IT DIDN'T TRY TO PERSUADE HER IT WOULDN'T IT BE ABLE TO CRY TO PERSUADE ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT I DID FEEL IT ON THURSDAY NIGHT HE SAID SEVERAL THINGS TO ME WHICH IF HE'D SAID TO ME ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE WAY ABOUT IT SO
JENNA SHE WASN'T REALLY A GOOD IDEA THEN WE BRING IN JENNA SHOP HERE BECAUSE YOU YOU VOTED TO LEAVE AND YOU'RE HAPPY THAT YOU DID SO I DID I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE CRAWLED OVER BROKEN GLASS TO VOTE TO LEAVE AND MY DECISION WAS BASED ON MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE OF THE E.U. A LOT OF RESEARCH SO THE IDEA THAT I DID I WAS MAKING A PROTEST VOTE OR I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE FACTS I REALLY RESENT THAT ARGUMENT AND I'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END AS HAVE PROBABLY MANY PEOPLE WHO VOTED LEAVE
OF SOME HORRIBLE HORRIBLE VITRIOL FROM REMAIN AS I MEAN I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY THAT I'M A NAZI XENOPHOBIA NON RACIST THAT WE'VE RUINED YOUNG PEOPLE'S FUTURES I EVEN HEARD PEOPLE SAYING IF YOU'RE OLD AND WHITE PLEASE DIE HE AWFUL AWFUL COMMENTS THAT FRANKLY JUST MAKE ME FEEL WELL I DID VOTE CORRECTLY BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE ONLY ARGUMENTS THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT IT SEEMS A LOT OF THESE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THEY WANT TO DO THE ECONOMY DOWN AND THEY WANT TO BE RIGHT SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY BOTHERED IF THE ECONOMY SUFFERS AT LEAST THEN THEY'LL BE RIGHT AND I JUST THINK THAT'S SUCH A DISAPPOINTING NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TO HAVE WHAT ARE YOU HOPING WILL HAPPEN NOW WHAT WAS YOUR VOTE OUT FOR MY FELL OUT WAS FOR
TAKING BACK CONTROL AND WE'VE HEARD THAT A LOT BUT IT WAS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR CONTROL I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE GLOBAL EST AGENDA I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN RUN OUR FARES BETTER IN OUR OWN COUNTRY AND ALSO THE OPTIMISTIC CASE FOR LEAVING THAT HERE WE ARE WE'VE GOT
THE WORLD AT THE WORLD IS OUR OYSTER NOW LITERALLY WE CAN MAKE TRADE DEALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SHACKLED TO THE FRANKLY DYING CORPSE THAT IS THE E.U. IT'S THE ONLY PARTY
THE ONLY CONCERT THAT WASN'T GROWING AND WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS LIVED WITH OUR FRIENDS IN YOUR AND WE CAN STILL TRADE WITH THEM WILL HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND IF WE DON'T BRING IMMIGRATION DOWN AS A RESULT OF LEAVING AND IF WE DON'T GET THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS BACK
WILL THAT DISAPPOINT YOU OH I THINK FOR ME THE ISSUE THEY WERE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH NUMBERS BUT ALSO AN ISSUE OF THE TYPE OF IMMIGRATION WE HAD AND WE NEED TO GET OVER THIS NARRATIVE THAT CONTROLLED IMMIGRATION IS SOMEHOW RACIST I DO WANT TO SEE NUMBERS COME DOWN BECAUSE I DO FEEL THERE ARE COUNTRY IS STRETCHED OUR RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED AND I DON'T THINK IT'S
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL POLITICALLY INCORRECT TO SAY THIS I AM AWARE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK AHEAD OF US BUT HAVING SOME KIND OF AUSTRALIAN POINT STAR SYSTEM GOING FOR IT I THINK WOULD REALLY BENEFIT AND WOULD ALLOW IS NOT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMONWEALTH OR OUTSIDE THE E.U. THEY HAVE SKILLS THAT THEY COULD BRING TO THIS COUNTRY AND THE MIG BARBARA YOU SAY REGRET IT BUT IT'S QUITE EARLY DAYS YOU MAY COME NOT TO REGRET YOUR VOTE
AWAY AND WORK IT WHAT DO I'D BEEN SPELLED OUT TO ME YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE
I KNOW I KNOW AND PEOPLE DIDN'T VOTE DID THEY THEY DIDN'T BOTHER BOTHER GOING OUT TO VOTE AND NOW THEY'RE COMPLAINING
WE DO KNOW THAT MANY OF THE YOUNG WHO DO VOTE IT VOTED TO REMAIN BUT BARBARA I THINK YOU SIGNED THE PETITION FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ARE YOU HOPEFUL THAT THERE COULD BE ONE
I AM BUT REALLY DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S STILL EVEN WHEN WE TAKE ACCOUNT OF THIS PULL THE MAJORITY STILL WOULD'VE VOTED TO LEAVE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER OVER COME ON OPINION I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
BARBARA IT WOULD BE BARBARA AND JENNA SHARP THANK YOU BOTH FOR TALKING TO US TIME THERE WAS HARPER STATE GARY RICHARDSON IS AT WIMBLEDON LUCKY MAN GARY
MICK VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU FROM CENTRE COURT THE COVERS ARE OFF THE COURT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY IMMACULATE THE SUN IS TRYING TO SHINE I'M STANDING BY THE UMPIRE'S CHAIR WHERE SHORTLY BEFORE ONE O'CLOCK THE UMPIRE WILL CLIMB FIVE STEPS
AND HE WILL CALL PLAY RICHARD LEWIS IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WIMBLEDON RICHARD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SO NOVAK DJOKOVIC STARTS HERE VERY VERY SHORTLY
IF HE WINS AGAIN HE'LL GET TWO MILLION POUNDS THE WOMEN'S CHAMPION GETS TWO MILLION POUNDS FORTY YEARS AGO THE MEN'S CHAMPION NOT TWO THOUSAND THE WOMEN'S CHAMPION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY WILL THERE EVER BE A CEILING IN PRIZE MONEY I'M NOT SURE THERE EVER WILL BE TO BE HONEST GARY I THINK
THE SUCCESS OF THE CHAMPIONSHIPS IS FORECAST TO GO ON AND WIN AND IMPROVE AND I THINK WE WILL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT THE PLAYERS SUCCESS ALTHOUGH WE WE FOCUS ON THE WINNER'S PRIZE MONEY AND HAS ALSO BEEN BIG INCREASES FOR THE EARLY ROUND LOSERS WHICH WE ALSO ALSO THINGS VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS IF YOU LOSE IN THE FIRST ROUND BUT IF WE WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THEN IN TWENTY YEARS GIVEN THE PERCENTAGE RISE OF THE LAST FORTY
YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT THE MEN'S CHAMPION MAYBE GETTING BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN MILLION POUNDS UNTHINKABLE BUT YOU SAY NO I DON'T KNOW WHO KNOWS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST HER FUTURE BUT AS I SAY THE INCREASE IN PRIZE MONEY IS IS REALLY COMPARABLE WITH THE INCREASE IN THE SUCCESS OF A GLOBAL EVENT LIKE WIMBLEDON MATCH FIXING HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS SADLY FOR THE SPORT OF TENNIS DURING TWENTY SIXTEEN
WHAT EXACTLY WILL BE MONITORED AT THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIPS AND HOW WILL IT BE DIFFERENT TO LAST YEAR WELL WOULD BE MORE ANALYSIS OF THE BETTING TRENDS THAT'S GOING ON DURING A MATCH THERE'LL BE MORE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA INPUT THAT GOES IN FROM THE UMPIRE'S CHAIR AND THERE'S A SECOND DAY TO FEED FOR
FOR THE MATCHES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASISE THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS LAST YEAR AT WIMBLEDON BUT WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE EVENTS OF EARLIER IN THE YEAR A LOT OF MEDIA FOCUS ON ON CORRUPTION AND WE THINK WE HAD TO RESPOND HOW EASY WOULD IT BE FOR A PLAYER TO ACTUALLY THROW A MATCH NOW YOU'RE A CHIEF EXECUTIVE BUT YOU'RE ALSO A TOP PLAYER YOU PLAYED HERE ON CENTRE COURT YOU WERE TOP SEVENTY IN THE WORLD THE DAVIS CUP FINAL
COULD YOU GO OUT IN DISGUISE AND DELIBERATELY PLAY BADLY CAN PLAYERS DO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT TO DELIBERATELY PLAY BADLY OF COURSE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFERENT DO THAT AND NOT BE FOUND OUT AND NOT GET SPOTTED BECAUSE OF THE ANALYSIS GOES ON ON A MATCH PARTICULAR TOP LEVEL A GRAND SLAM EVENTS LIKE WIMBLEDON
I THINK IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHETHER YOU COULD GET SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE IN A COURT OF LAW I THINK THAT MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER BUT BUT YOU BE UNDER SUSPICION ALMOST WITHIN THE FIRST FEW POINTS NOW LONG QUEUES OUTSIDE AS ALWAYS ON THE FIRST DAY ANOTHER DAY'S JUST REMIND US FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO COME ALONG IN TERMS OF TICKETS WHAT CAN PEOPLE TURN UP AND SEE TODAY
A FANTASTICAL REPLACE TODAY WITH MENTION THEY WENT JOCKEY VIRTUALLY GOBBY MEGA MEGA ETHER AND ROGER FEDERER ON CENTRE COURT THEY NICKED THE FAME FAMOUS CUE THE CURIOUS QUITE LONG AT THE MOMENT BUT WE PUT OUT MESSAGES THROUGH A WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S THE WAY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE QUEUE IS IS TOO LONG AND ACTUALLY CLOSE BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE BEST WAY MONITORING WHAT'S GOING ON AND IN TERMS OF MEN'S AND WOMEN'S CHAMPIONS WHAT ARE YOUR SORT OF EARLY THOUGHTS I KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE DIPLOMATIC BUT YOU CAN YOU SEE ANYONE STOPPING JOCHEN JOCHEN
I CAN I BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT HE HASN'T INVINCIBLE HE HE IS A GREAT PLAYER AND HE WAS A FANTASTIC RUN OF FORM AT THE MOMENT BUT I THINK ANDY MURRAY CLEARLY IS STARTING TO PUSH HIM AND I THINK THE IS PUTTING MORE WIDE OPEN WE MIGHT THINK AT ANY PLAYS JAMES WALTER BRITAIN THIS JAMES WARD SO IT SORT OF DAVID AGAINST GOLIATH NOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IT
COMING OUT HERE AND PLAYING AT JIMMY CONNORS FOR JAMES WARD IN A FEW HOURS WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE COMING OUT KNOWING YOU'RE PLAYING THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD WITH WHICH YOU DID WITH COMMAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHY IS DAUNTING BUT IT'S VERY EXCITING IS YOU KNOW IT'S A MOMENT IN YOUR CAREER THAT YOU'LL NEVER FORGET AND I KNOW THAT'S JAMES ATTITUDE JAMES A VERY EXPERIENCED PLAYER AND PROVED HIMSELF AS VAGUE CAPER RISE INTO THE BIG OCCASION THAT'S WHAT HE'LL BE PLANNING TO DO TODAY
RICHARD FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE GOT HERE AND I'VE GOT A COMPLAINT YOU'VE GOT AN ELECTRIC MOWER AND PEOPLE SAY THEY LOVE THE SOUND EFFECTS THEY LOVE THE SORT OF KNOCKING ON THE CHAIRS THEY LOVE HEARING THE MOWER AND NOW YOU'VE GOT AN ELECTRIC MOWER AND WE CAN HARDLY HEAR IT I KNOW BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT THAT WHAT IT'S PRODUCING ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC HOW DOES HE DO LINES LIKE THAT WITHOUT ANY STRING OUT THERE WELL I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A GO AT THAT AND IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU THINK MY RESULTS WERE NOT AS GOOD AS HIS BUT HE HAS DONE IT A BIT MORE OFTEN
RICHARD LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S STARTING TO RAIN SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY TELL YOU THAT AT THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS ENGLAND PLAY ICELAND THIS EVENING WALES FACE BELGIUM IN THE QUARTER FINALS AFTER BELGIUM HAMMERED HUNGRY FOR NAIL GERMANY BEAT SLOVAKIA THREE NIL BUT MESSY HAS ANNOUNCED HIS INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT AT JUST TWENTY NINE HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER MISSING A PENALTY IN THE FINAL OF THE COPA AMERICA WHICH CHILLI WON ON PENALTIES HERE ARE THEIR TIPS PONTEFRACT TWO O'CLOCK NUMBER THIRTEEN

MORNING GARY THERE'S ABOUT LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY AHEAD SOMEONE HELP WHO I'M SURE IS ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY AHEAD NOT LEAST TO START THE WEEK IS ANDREW MARR WHO'S WITH US THANK YOU WELL ONE OF THE GREAT CLICHE WORDS WERE USED IN POLITICS WHEN THEY GET AS RUMBUSTIOUS AS THEY HAVE OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS IS VISCERAL WE SAY OUR POLITICS HAVE BECOME VISCERAL WE FEEL THEM IN THE GUT BUT IN A WAY THIS REMINDS US HOW LUCKY WE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY STILL BECAUSE FOR MOST OF US HAVING ENOUGH TO EAT
HE'S NOT A POLITICAL PROBLEM PERHAPS TO OFFER A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE IN THESE STRANGE DAYS ON START THE WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT RATIONING THE EFFECTIVE FOOD PRICES ON TURMOIL PARTICULARLY ARAB SPRING AND A LOCAL FOOD PROBLEM HERE OBESITY AND REALLY BAD EATING A TRIO OF EXCELLENT SHARP WRITERS JOINING AT NIGHT IF YOU FINISHED YOUR BREAKFAST AND YOU CAN STOMACH US JOIN ME TOO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT OR LOOK AT THE WEATHER LARGELY FINE WITH SUNNY SPELLS BUT SHOWERS AFFECTING NORTHERN PARTS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S GET ON WITH THE SOME OF THE NEWS CHARLES CARROLL IS HERE GEORGE OSBORNE HAS SOUGHT TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC AND THE MARKETS THAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS PREPARED AND EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE CHALLENGE OF BREAKS IT
THE CHANCELLOR INSISTED THE U.K. ECONOMY WOULD NEED TO ADJUST TO THAT DECISION BUT INSISTED THAT IT WOULD DO SO FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH THE POUND FELL BY TWO PER CENT AGAINST THE DOLLAR BUT HAS RECOVERED SINCE MISTER OSBORNE'S COMMENTS THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX DROPPED BY NEARLY ONE PER CENT IN EARLY TRADING BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION MY JOHNSON WHO LED THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAID THAT HE STILL BELIEVED BRITAIN WOULD BE ABLE TO RETAIN ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WHILE RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HAS BEEN HIT BY FOUR MORE RESIGNATIONS FROM HIS MINISTERIAL TEAM THIS MORNING AS HE FIGHTS TO KEEP HIS JOB ELEVEN OF THE PARTY'S FRONT BENCH STOOD DOWN YESTERDAY FOLLOWING THE SACKING OF HILARY BENN AND THE QUEEN AND THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH WILL TODAY BEGIN A TWO DAY VISIT TO NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S THE QUEEN'S FIRST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHEN THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND VOTED TO REMAIN
IT'S TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HAS ANNOUNCED A WHOLE RAFT OF NEW APPOINTMENTS TO HIS SHADOW TEAM HE NEEDED TO THEY WERE MORE RESIGNATIONS THIS MORNING TO ADD TO THE TWELVE WHO LEFT OVER THE WEEKEND AND YET LATE LAST NIGHT THE LABOUR LEADER VOWED THAT HE WOULD STAND AGAIN IN ANY LEADERSHIP ELECTION JUST OVER AN HOUR AGO THE FORMER SHADOW LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS BRYANT SAID JEREMY CORBIN COULD NOT WIN AN ELECTION AND WAS LOSING THE SUPPORT OF LABOUR VOTERS
ON THE DOORSTEP IN MY CONSTITUENCY EVERY SECOND PERSON SAID LOOK MATE I'M LABOUR THROUGH AND THROUGH BUT I'M NOT VOTING FOR LABOUR ON THE JOURNEY CAULDON EVERY SECOND PERSON
WHEN I WENT TO A CONSTITUENCY LABOUR PARTY MEETING IN TWO WEEKS AGO TO TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE YOU THE FIRST PERSON WHO STOOD UP SAID TO ME LISTEN I JOINED THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE OF JEREMY BUT HE'S GOT TO GO
CHRIS BRYANT WELL CATS SMITH IS WELL I WAS BUT SHE SHADOW MINISTER FOR WOMEN BUT ACTUALLY SHE'S JUST BEEN PROMOTED IN THIS LATEST RESHUFFLE AND IS NOW SHADOW SHADOWS FOR VOTER ENGAGEMENT IN YOUTH AFFAIRS SHE'S ALSO A SUPPORTER OF JEREMY CORBIN AND SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TEA ANALLY GIVEN THE SCALE OF RESIGNATIONS AND DEPARTURES FROM THE SHADOW CABINET CAN JEREMY CORBIN REALLY STALE
I WOULD IN MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE RESIGNING TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT THEIR TIMING THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THE RIGHT OF LABOUR M.P.S TO TABLE NATIONS HAVE NO CONFIDENCE I'D SAY THAT THE TIMING IS COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED AND RIGHT NOW THE COUNTRY NEEDS THE LABOUR PARTY TO COME TOGETHER
TO UNIFY AND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM GEORGE OSBORNE STATEMENTS MORNING THE PRIORITY HAS TO BE AT THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW AND WE DON'T HAVE THE LIPS WE HAVE THIS INTERNAL NAVEL GAZING IS SELF INDULGENCE OF ATTEMPTED TO QUEUE BUT IT'S
POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ALL THAT BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY AND THE NECESSITY FOR A STRONG OPPOSITION THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING THIS DECISION AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN OFFER A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW BUT IT WOULD INVOLVE THE LABOUR PARTY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY COMING TOGETHER AND UNITING BEHIND JEREMY CORBIN RIGHT NOW WELL HOW ABOUT UNITING BEHIND SOMEBODY ELSE CHRIS BRYANT SAID IN HIS RESIGNATION THAT MY RISK GOING DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MAN WHO BROKE THE LABOUR PARTY UNLESS HE STANDS ASIDE
OR A DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY OUR ONLY AS STRONG AS OUR MEMBERS AND IT'S BEEN LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE OUR MEMBERS GAVE US A VERY CLEAR DECISION IN THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION ARE VERY CLEAR AND DEFINITE MANDATE FOR JEREMY CORBIN AND IF WE ARE TO FACE EH GENERAL ELECTION LABOUR M.P.S WILL BE WRITING TO THEIR MEMBERS AND SAYING WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BUT WE HAVE YOU WE HAVE OUR MEMBERS THAT IS OUR STRENGTH AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE RESPECTS ARE MEMBERS AND THOUGH THIS VISION THEY MADE
A LAST SEPTEMBER IN THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION THE TRUE HEARD CHRIS BRYANT THEY'RE MAKING THE POINT THAT IT'S PEOPLE WHO IS SPEAKING TO HIM WE'VE HEARD THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN FROM THOSE WHO ARE GOING WHO SAY IT'S IT'S THE MEMBERS IT'S WELL LEAST IT'S SOME OF THE MEMBERS BUT IT'S ALSO THE COUNTRY HE CANNOT WIN A GENERAL ELECTION SO YOU COULD APPLY ALL YOUR ARGUMENTS TO THE PARTY UNIFYING BEHIND SOMEBODY THAT THEY BELIEVE COULD WIN A GENERAL ELECTION
WELL THE BEST INDICATOR OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE CAN WIN A GENERAL ELECTION IS HOW THEY PERFORM AT ELECTIONS AND IN MAY'S AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT NO ACTIONS AND ELECTIONS HERE IN LONDON AND THE LABOUR PARTY MANAGED TO MAKE GAINS AND CERTAINLY IN MY AREA WE TOOK SEATS OF THE CONSERVATIVES WE WEREN'T EVEN EXPECTING
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BEST INDICATION REALLY THE FACT THAT WE WERE TO SIMMER GENERAL ELECTION WHICH ISN'T IT LIGHTLY SON ELECTION BUT WE ARE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH THE WILL OF OUR MEMBERSHIP
THE DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON HASN'T COME OUT YET IF HE DOES HE WAS ELECTED TO THAT POSITION
CAN JEREMY QUIT IF HE COMES OUT AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN CANNY STUFF DOWN I WOULDN'T REALLY WANT TO ENTER INTO THE SPECULATION ABOUT IF SOMEWHAT WHAT IFS IF CERTAIN PEOPLE DO CERTAIN THINGS JAMIE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR IN HIS STATEMENT LAST NIGHT THEY INTEND STAY ON AS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AND I SUPPORT HIM AND DOING THAT
DO YOU WOULD YOU URGE HIM TO STAY ON GIVEN BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUR ARGUMENTS IN A WAY MIGHT HAVE APPLIED WHEN IT WAS A CONVERSATION BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BUT NOW THEY'VE ALL COME OUT THEY'VE ALL GONE WELL I'VE GOT A WHOLE RAFT PEOPLE THAT MADE NOBODY WILL HAVE EVER HEARD OF I WISH THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THE LABOUR PARTY TAKES TO THE MEDIAN THE AIRWAVES TO DISCUS AND A DISCO IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE LABOUR PARTY IS A BROAD CHURCH
WE HAVE MEMBERS AND SUPPORT AND M.P.S REPRESENT QUITE A BROAD RANGE OF SOCIALISTS AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS CRACKED AND SET SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A LABOUR PARTY THAT REFLECTS BACK WHICH IS WHAT I THINK JEREMY CORBIN WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL A SHADOW CABINET ACTUALLY WAS REACHING OUT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS
IT'S FAILS IT WAS INCLUDES SALES THOUGH IF WE GET TO THE POINT OF ANOTHER ELECTION FOR LABOUR LEADERSHIP DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD STAND AGAIN IN THAT I THINK HE SHOULD OFFER THE MEMBERS THEIR TOWN'S CHIP TO RE ELECT AS IT COMES TO THAT HE HAS SHE DID YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UNITY ONE THING YOU CAN BE SURE OF IS IF HE STANDS AGAIN THE PARTY WILL NOT BE UNITED
WELL WITH THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION OBVIOUSLY CAN DATES GOING TO GET ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE VOTES AND I'D THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY STRANGE SHOULD THAT HAPPEN BUT MY PARTY IS STRONGER BECAUSE JEREMY BECAME LEADER WE HAVE ENGAGED A LOT OF PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY JOIN A POLITICAL PARTY TO TAKE PART TO JOIN ME YOUNG CAMPAIGN SESSION WITH JEREMY CORBIN IF THERE WERE A GENERAL ELECTION BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR JEREMY CORBIN COULD WIN IT
I BELIEVE YOU COULD ACTUALLY YES CAN'T SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE BORIS JOHNSON THIS MORNING IS NOT PRODUCED A PLAN FOR WHAT LEAVING THE E.U. MIGHT ME BUT HE SAYS THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH TO GET OUT IT'S NOT QUITE THE VIEW ONE'S HEARING FROM EUROPE OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS THE FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER THIS MORNING MICHELLE SAPPER HAS SAID IT BREAKS IT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY WE CANNOT REMAIN IN AN UNCERTAIN AND INDEFINITE SITUATION
JOIN US ON THE LINE NOW CATCHER OR EUROPE EDITOR OF COURSE HOW MUCH IN PATIENTS IS THEIR CATCH BECAUSE GERMAN VOICES ARE SOUNDING A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE NEED FOR TIME ON AND THERE'S NOT A LOT THEY CAN DO TO FORCE BRITAIN OUT WHAT IS THAT
WELL FIRST OF ALL LIFE I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF INWARD REFLECTION IN THE U.K. AT THE MOMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOR LEAVING AND AGAINST LEAVING WERE REALLY PREPARED FOR BRECHT'S AT VOTE BUT SIMILARLY YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY SEEM PRETTY UNPREPARED AS WELL THERE WAS WIDESPREAD SHOCK ON FRIDAY MORNING AND YOU COULD THEN SEE A SORT OF A CACOPHONY OF VOICES ALL SAYING DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU COULD HAVE GOT TO LEAVE NOW NO IT'S GOT TIME TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS FALLING APART NO WE'RE GOING TO GO STRONGER TOGETHER
AND IN ALL OF THAT ANGELA MERKEL ONCE AGAIN IS TAKING CENTRE STAGE AS SHE TENDS TO DO IN ALL THINGS Y. YOU SHE IS NOW MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER INSIDE THAT YOU NOW THAT THE U.K. HAS DECIDED TO LEAVE AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO IS TO FOLD ALLOW BRITAIN TO LEAVE AS SMOOTHLY AND AS SOON AS IS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE
SAFEGUARDING OF COURSE GERMAN TRADE INTEREST BUT ALSO TO SAFEGUARD THE FUTURE OF THE E.U. SO WHAT WE'VE GOT THIS WEEK TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THERE'S A SUMMIT OF OF E.U. LEADERS IN BRUSSELS ON TUESDAY DEBORAH CAMERON WILL BE THERE THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY AND AWKWARD AND MEETING BUT FIRST OF ALL TODAY ANGELA MERKEL HAS INVITED THE FRENCH PRESIDENT AND THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER JUST TO SHOW THAT FRANCE AND GERMANY AREN'T BEING TOO ELITIST I THINK THAT'S ANGELA MERKEL'S HOPE
AND IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT IMAGE AS CONTENT TO SAY LOOK AT ITS CORE THE E.U. IS UNITED WE WILL FIND A WAY FORWARD WE WILL DEAL WITH THE BRITISH VOTE AND WE WILL GO ON AHEAD CARRIED YOU CAN'T FORCE THE U.K. TO DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE U.K. OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCES ITS INTENTION TO LEAVE CATCHER HAD LA THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NOW WHEN WE TALK OF THE U.K. YOU DOING THINGS
COURSE IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ALONE THAT WILL DO THAT LITTLE IN THE NEW PRIME MINISTER PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE TO BACK IT AND PARLIAMENT HAS MAJORITY FOR STAYING IN THE EH YOU NOT FORGETTING OUT WHICH IS WHY LORD HESELTINE AMONGST OTHERS HAS ARGUED THERE MIGHT HAVE TO BE A GENERAL ELECTION OR A SECOND REFERENDUM LORD HESELTINE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW PEOPLE WILL SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY MICHAEL HAS DONE YOU'RE A BAD LOSER AND YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF DEMOCRACY
SO IS YOUR NAME AN EFFECT ON THAT PETITION THAT SAYS LET'S DO IT ALL AGAIN
YEAH SO THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE IS QUITE OBVIOUS THIS FORGIVE ME THESE ARE ARGUMENTS YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE AND YOU LOST YOU SAY YOU ACCEPT DEMOCRACY BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU SAY YOU WANT TO RE RUN THE REFERENDUM OR OH NO SAYING YOU WANT TO GIVE ALL RIGHT LET ME JUST PUT THE QUESTION IF I COULD OR ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT A DIFFERENT SORT OF REFERENDUM ON WHATEVER THE PLAN THAT NOW EMERGES IS
BEFORE I HEAR PEOPLE CURSING THE CARRIED THROUGH IT ALL AGAIN I'M AFRAID WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THEY'RE NOT HESELTINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE HOW NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE UNRAVELLED IS SOMETHING WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE WATCHING CLOSELY TO STATE THE OBVIOUS NOT LEAST THOUGH THOSE IN THE CITY A BUSINESS PRESENTER DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS THERE HELLO AGAIN DOMINIC GOOD MORNING WHAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DOOM AND GLOOM HERE FROM THOSE VISITORS WHO WERE IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN BUT SOMEBODY'S PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK BRICKS IS A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION
A FEW MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE TO PETER HARGREAVES A FOUNDER OF HARGREAVES LANDS A LENS DOWN THE FOOTY ONE HUNDRED PERSONAL FINANCE BUSINESS
WHO HELPED FUND THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT THE SPODE MEANT FOR BUSINESS
I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD FOR BUSINESS IN BRITAIN NOT LEAST SOMETHING THAT I HADN'T ENVISAGED QUITE AS SERIOUSLY AS HAPPENED IS THAT HE'S THE DEVALUATION OF THE POUND EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY OR BECAUSE THERE IS A SURPLUS OF MANUFACTURING IN THE WORLD AND THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SELL THIS STUFF IS IF HE SOLD IT CHEAP
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ANY CHEAPER THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET THE PRICES DOWN IS IF YOUR CURRENCY GOES DOWN SO BRITISH MANUFACTURING SHOULD BE LAUGHING I MEAN WE DO WE DO MAKE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CARS IN THIS COUNTRY I KNOW MOST OF THE CAR MANUFACTURERS I TOLD BY THE BRITISH ANY MORE BUT THOSE THOSE VEHICLES WILL BE VERY VERY COMPETITIVE ON WORLD MARKETS NOW A PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES WILL DO WELL AND A LOT OF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES
HOW ENORMOUS OVERSEAS EARNINGS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THERE ARE EARNINGS ARE FROM OVERSEAS WHEN THOSE EARNINGS ARE REPATRIATED IN STIRLING THEY'RE WORTH FAR MORE THAN THERE USED TO BE SO MOST FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES PROFIT SHOULD GO UP SO WHY PEOPLE ARE SELLING THE MARKET IS THIS IS A SURPRISE TO ME
I HAVE A READ YOU SO GONE BUT DO YOU SAY PETER INTO THOSE TO THOSE COMPANIES WHO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN THE UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THE BOAT MIGHT CAUSE AND TO PUT INVESTMENT ON HOLD DEAL WITH DO YOU THINK THAT'S A SHORT TERM EFFECT OR DO YOU THINK IT'S REAL
UNCERTAINTY IS ALWAYS BAD FOR BUSINESS AND IT'S BAD FOR MARKETS I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE UNCERTAINTY IS THE END WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE E.U. I THINK THE UNCERTAINTY IS IN THE DEAL THAT WE'RE GOING TO STRIKE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THE NATIONS IN ME
WE ARE A NET IMPORTER OF THEIR GOODS IN OTHER WORDS WE BUY MORE FROM THEM THAN BUY FROM US SO THEY ARE I'M GOING TO DO ANYTHING STUPID TO THEN DANGER THAT SITUATION THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING HERE AROUND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE AND BUSINESS ISN'T HE FIFTY FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SHEEP EXECUTIVES
WROTE TO SAY VOTE TO REMAIN AND PEOPLE IGNORE THEM IT'S SOMETHING ROUND HERE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIG BUSINESS AND THE ELECTORATE
I THINK THE ESTABLISHMENT IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT COMPLETELY MISJUDGED THE MOOD OF THE NATION I WAS AMAZED HOW THEY HADN'T REALLY UNDERSTOOD HOW THE NATION WAS VERY VERY
UPSET AND TO YOU THE E.U. AND THEY MISSED IT COMPLETELY AND ALL THE POLITICIANS MISSED IT COMPLETELY IT WAS THERE TO SEE HER I'M ORIGINALLY FROM THE NORTH WEST AND I DID GO UP TO THE NORTH WEST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I SUSPECT AND THEORY
AND TO YOU YOU FEELING WAS ENORMOUS HOW COULD THE POLITICIANS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT NOT HAVE REALISED THAT AND OF COURSE WHEN THEY STARTED CAMPAIGNING REMAIN CAN PAY SOME OF THE STUFF THEY WERE SAYING WAS RATHER EXTRAORDINARY AND THE PROBLEM WAS PEOPLE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT IF IT HAD BEEN REALISTIC IN WHAT THEY SAID PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT THAT WAS PETER HARGREAVES FOUNDER OF HARGREAVES
DOMINIC THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WELL LET'S PICK UP ON THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKING SINCE THE RESULTS OF THURSDAY'S VOTE BECAME CLEAR WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHAT IS THE PLAN NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW ARTICLE FIFTY THE FORMER PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING OUR EXIT WILL NOT BE TRIGGERED AND TILL OCTOBER AT THE EARLIEST WHEN THERE IS A NEW LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL THERE THEN BE ANOTHER GENERAL ELECTION WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN SCOTLAND SO HOW SHOULD A PARLIAMENT RESPOND WELL WE'RE JOINED BY THREE M. P.
DANIEL CAV CHIN SKI IS A PROBE IT BRICKS IT CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE REYNOLDS IS A LABOUR M.P. SHE SUPPORTED THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN STEPHEN GETHIN'S FROM THE S.N.P. IS THE BODY'S EUROPE SPOKESPERSON SITS ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE AND HE'S ANOTHER SUPPORTER OF REMAIN HIS AND A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CAN I START WITH THAT PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY LORD HESELTINE DANIEL CAPTAINSKI THAT ACTUALLY
LIKES HAVE YOU COME UP WITH A PLAN YOU WERE AFTER ALL IN FAVOUR OF BRECK'S IT AND THEN THAT GOES TO THE COUNTRY IN SOME FORM EITHER VIA REFERENDUM OR AN ELECTION GENERAL ELECTION
WELL I AM I'M ASTOUNDED AND QUITE FRANKLY APPALLED AT HOW LORD HESELTINE IS PLAYING DOWN OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK A PERIOD OF SILENCE FROM HIM AS MY COLLEAGUE CHEAP JACOB REES MOGG SAID THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED
THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN NOW HAVE FOUR BRECK'S IT AND CLEARLY THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET AN EQUITABLE AND FAIR NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
BUT ONE THING I'D LIKE TO REITERATE MOST STRONGLY IS THAT ANGELA MERKEL IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE POLITICIANS IN THE WORLD AND SHE KNOWS THAT IF THE NEGOTIATIONS CAN GO WELL
AND THAT THE GERMANS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY CAN GET THE EUROPEAN UNION TO REALLY COLLABORATE WITH BRITAIN IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY IN OUR SEPARATION
THAT WILL LEAD IN MY VIEW TO ONE OF THE GREATEST RENAISSANCE OF ANGLO GERMAN RELATIONS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE AND LOOK FORWARD TO IT
THE REYNOLDS DEUCED ACCEPT THAT PEOPLE ARE PERHAPS BEING TOO PESSIMISTIC AND THERE IS A POSSIBLE BRIGHT FUTURE AS OUTLINED THAT I VOTED REMAIN I I URGED PEOPLE TO VOTE REMAIN AND I ACCEPT THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM LAST THURSDAY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY REMAIN CAMP DID DO IS TO WARN ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING THE E.U. AND WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WERE SCAREMONGERING AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MARKET AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POUND
ON FRIDAY THAT WE WERE NOT ONLY WERE THE RISKS OF LEAVING BUT NOW WE WON'T WE NEED TO DO IS MINIMISE THE IMPACT OF THE ON THE ECONOMY OF LEAVING THE E.U. AND WITH THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS FOR THE BRECHT'S OR TEARS BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A PLAN FRANKLY BEFORE LAST THURSDAY AND IT'S PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE THAT THEY DID NOT THAT WE NEED A PLAN IN SHORT ORDER AND ALTHOUGH WE SHOULDN'T RUSH THE NEGOTIATIONS AND WE NEED TO GET THEM RIGHT
THEY CANNOT GO ON FOR YEARS IF THIS WAS SEEN TO BE DRAGGING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE DECISIONS AROUND INVESTMENTS THAT YOUR BUSINESS PEOPLE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE PUT ON HOLIC EBRINGTON LONGER SO THERE'S REAL RISKS HERE TO THE ECONOMY WE NEED TO OH K. B. YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY START SOONER THAN THERE IS A NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER IN PLACE WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION OF THE PLAN I THINK IN SHORT ORDER OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE A NEW PRIME MINISTER BY OCTOBER BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT IT IS
CURIOUS THAT THE EURO SCEPTIC SHOULD SAY OH THERE'S NO GREAT RUSH IN US LEAVING THE E.U. WHEN THEY'RE THE KEENEST PEOPLE TO LEIGH IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. WHAT WE NEED IN SHORT ORDER IS A PLAN A DETAILED PLAN ABOUT HOW WE GO FORWARD WITH THESE NEGOTIATIONS I HOPE THAT THERE IS A STRONG VOICE FOR THE LABOUR PARTY AND OTHER PARTIES IN THIS TOO YEAH AND WE NEED TO TRY AND MINIMISE THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE IT WILL BE
YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS IN LABOUR SEATS WHO WILL BE MOST AFFECTED IS THE ECONOMY IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS OH GOING STEPHEN GETHIN'S FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW A PARTICULAR SITTING AS AN S. M. P. M. P. WANTING INDEPENDENCE BUT WANTING IT AT A TIME OF YOUR CHOOSING PRESUMABLY THE LONGER GAME IS THE BETTER GETTING WELL
I THINK THAT WE WE WE WANT AND PUT THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM SOMETHING IS CLEARLY ON THE TABLE SCOTS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO REMAIN PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT I THINK THAT GETTING SOME DETAILS OUT OF LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ARE SOMETHING LIKE EVER PICKED UP LIKE HOT LORD HESELTINE PICKED UP SOMETHING IT WOULDN'T GO AMISS LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE'VE GOT A LARGE NUMBER OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHO COULD DO WITH A BIT OF CERTAINTY AS WELL AS THE U.K. CITIZENS WHO BENEFIT FROM FREE MOVEMENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
DO YOU SEE A WAY THAT THIS LAST WEEK'S VOTE COULD EFFECTIVELY BE UNDONE
WHETHER IT'S BY BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF M.P.S ARE NOT IN FAVOUR OF BRECK'S IT
COULD IT BE THAT WHETHER IT'S VIA A GENERAL ELECTION OR A PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD THAT WE END UP NOT EXITING I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESPECT THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM AND I SAY THAT WITH A HEAVY HEART BECAUSE I VOTED TO REMAIN I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISN'T EVEN GETHIN AND I GO BACK ON IT YEAH CAN I SAY
IT'S SCOTLAND WE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO REMAIN A FACT IF YOU LOOK AT AND REMAIN IN THE DIFFERENT ELECTORAL REGIONS OF THE U.K. LIKE REGIONS IN INVERTED COMMAS IN SCOTLAND THE BIGGEST VOTE FOR EITHER A LEVER WAS THERE REMAIN FOUGHT IN SCOTLAND BUT IS OVERWHELMED BY LOOKING NO WORD WE HAVE WE WAIT A MINUTE LOOKING FORWARD I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED SCOTTISH POLITICIAN TO REFLECT THE WHALE
OF MY CONSTITUENTS JUST AS NICOLA STURGEON SET OUT SHE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS TO REMAIN AND THAT'S WHAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ARE LOOKING AT IT DANIEL CAPTAINSKI WELL IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND HIGHLY DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WERE
WHAT WAS OVERTURNED IN ANYWAY SUGGESTIONS BY MISTER LIMEY A LABOUR M.P. IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONGERS SOMEHOW OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE I THINK ARE AMONGST SOME OF THE MOST FRIGHTENING AND WORRYING STATEMENTS THAT I'VE HAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME WE ALL WENT TO THE ELECTORATE WE ALL PUT OUR CASE THEY HAD OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY WERE BOMBARDED WITH THE FACT THEY HAVE NOW SPOKEN AND THAT DECISION MUST BE RESPECTED AND OF COURSE IT IS A VERY CONFUSED VOICE BUT WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE DANIEL CAV CHIN SKI
