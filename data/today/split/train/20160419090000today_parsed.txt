THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED IN THE EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK ECUADOR ON SATURDAY HAS RISEN TO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN RESCUE TEAMS SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF COLLAPSED BUILDINGS HAVE PULLED OUT A NUMBER OF SURVIVORS INCLUDING A NINE MONTH OLD BABY
CANCER RESEARCHERS SAY THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA WHO WERE TREATED WITH A COMBINATION OF TWO IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUGS IN A TRIAL SURVIVED FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS THE STUDY OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FORTY PATIENTS ALSO FOUND THAT A FIFTH OF THEM HAD NO MORE SIGNS OF TUMOURS AFTER RECEIVING THE DRUGS IT BILLY MA'AM IT BILLY MOON BAD AND NIVEA LOOM UP A HEALTH REPORTER JAMES GALLAGHER HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THEIR FINDINGS
A PILLAR MOVE VOLLMER ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AS TREATMENTS FOR MELANOMA ON THE N.H.S. BUT MOST RESEARCHERS BELIEVE COMBINATION THERAPY WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GIVE PATIENTS THE BEST CHANCE OF SURVIVAL DATA FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PATIENTS GIVEN BOTH DRUGS SHOWED SIXTY NINE PER CENT WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER TWO YEARS AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT HAD NO SIGN OF TUMOURS IN THEIR BODY THE POTENTIAL OF THESE DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED WIDELY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO SURVIVAL FIGURES

IMAGES OF THE ORIGINAL TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD ARCH SO THE TEXTURE OF THE STONE COULD BE REPLICATED IT'S A COLLABORATION BETWEEN EXPERTS FROM OXFORD AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S AND DUBAI'S MUSEUM AT THE FUTURE
THE GROUP HOPE TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS MIGHT HELP REBUILD PARTS OF POWELL MIRROR BUT SOME CLASSICAL SCHOLARS THINK THE REPLICA ARCH IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
A STUDY HAS SUGGESTED THAT DINOSAURS WERE DYING OUT FIFTY MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE ASTEROID IMPACT THAT'S BEEN BLAMED FOR WIPING THEM OUT THE RESEARCH FROM SCIENTISTS AT READING AND BRISTOL UNIVERSITY'S HAS A COOLING CLIMATE CHANGING SEA LEVELS AND THE BREAKING UP OF THE EARTH'S CONTINENTS WERE AMONG THE CAUSES THEIR FINDINGS CHALLENGE THE VIEW THE DINOSAURS WERE FLOURISHING RIGHT UP UNTIL THE ASTEROID HIT THE EARTH SIXTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO
THANK YOU NEIL IT'S SIX MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S GO TO THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE THOMAS CHEF ANNEKA IS WAITING FOR US THERE MORNING TOM VERY GOOD MORNING TO NICK MICHELLE AND EVERYONE ELSE IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO BAD ACTUALLY FOR MOST OF US FOR THE REST OF THIS WEEK TODAY THERE'S A TOUCH OF GROUND FROST ACROSS NORTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S RIGHT NOW THE THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY IS QUITE MILD TEMPERATURES IN LONDON CURRENTLY TEN DEGREES
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY IS STEADY AS SHE GOES WITH THE WEATHER THE CLOUDS WILL BE BREAKING UP IN THE SOUTH BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE BIT ON THE CLOUDY SIDE RIGHT NOW AND I THINK FOR MOST OF US THIS AFTERNOON IT'S NOT LOOKING BAD AT ALL SOME SUNSHINE ON THE WAY FOR MOST AREAS AT THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE PROBABLY ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA THE CLOUDY AREAS
WILL BE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SOUTH WEST PERHAPS CORNWALL DEVON SOMERSET MAYBE SOUTHERN PARTS OF WALES TOO AND ALSO A BIT OF CLOUD DURING THE DAY ACROSS SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A DRY DAY AND THE TEMPERATURES TODAY GLASGOW EDINBURGH AND BELFAST SHOULD WARM UP TO AROUND ABOUT TWELVE DEGREES MANCHESTER AT FOURTEEN AND LONDON PERHAPS UP TO AS HIGH AS SIXTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WE'RE GOING TO GET
AND THEN THIS EVENING MUCH OF THE CLOUD THAT DOES DEVELOP DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY IT WILL CLEAR AND WE'RE IN FOR A CLEAR CHILLY EVENING SO THAT MEANS THAT TEMPERATURES WILL BE DIPPING AWAY QUITE QUICKLY TONIGHT AGAIN A TOUCH OF FROST FOR MANY OF US FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING AROUND THREE TO FIVE DEGREES IN TOWN CENTRES BUT A BIT COLDER OUTSIDE OF TOWN AND THEN TOMORROW I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL SPARKLING SUNNY DAY FOR MOST OF THE U.K.
THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE LEAD FOR BOTH THE GUARDIAN AND THE EYE IS MICHAEL GO SPEECH LATER ON TODAY SAYING WHY HE BELIEVES BRITAIN SHOULD VOTE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. THIS IS AFTER GEORGE OSBORNE OR DOMINATED YESTERDAY SAID TODAY'S MICHAEL GOES THEN BOTH THE GUARDIAN AND THE EYE ARE PICKING UP ON WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT TREATING THE PUBLIC LIKE CHILDREN WITH WITH SCARE STORIES AND THEY
GOVERNMENT THINKS WERE CAPABLE OF BEING FRIGHTENED INTO OBEDIENCE IS GOING TO SAY BY CONJURING UP NEW BOGEYMAN EVERY NIGHT AT THE GUARDIANS OF THE INTENSITY OF THE DEBATE'S LIKELY TO INCREASE AS OPINION POLLS POINT TO AN UNCOMFORTABLY TIGHT REFERENDUM FOR THE CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIME MINISTER IT'S HADDOCK AND TELEPHONE POLL CONDUCTED BY I.C.M. WHICH PUTS REMAIN ON FIFTY FOUR PER CENT LEAVE ON FORTY SIX PER CENT A SECOND POLE ONLINE SUGGESTS A DEAD HEAT
SOME OF THE PAPERS PARTICULARLY THE PAPERS THAT WANT YOU TO VOTE FOR LEAVE HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT GEORGE OSBORNE DID SAY ON THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY BUT DIDN'T PLAN TO SAY REALLY WHICH WAS THAT ALL THOSE TREASURY FORECASTS WERE BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION THEN IMMIGRATION REMAINS HIGHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT'S TARGET THEY SAID STAND A PREDICTION IT'S DONE INDEPENDENTLY BUT HE'S PRODUCED HEADLINES LIKE THIS DAILY MAIL
OSBORNE'S THREE MILLION MIGRANT BOMBSHELL SUB HEADLINE TORY SAVAGE CHANCELLOR OVER E.U. PROPAGANDA DOSSIER THAT ADMITS BRITAIN'S POPULATION WILL SAW THE SUN LET THREE MILLION MORE INTO THE Y. U. IS HOW THEY PUT IT THE TELEGRAPH OFFICIAL ADMISSION INTERESTINGLY PUT IN INVERTED COMMAS BY IN CAMPAIGN THAT YOU K. CAN'T CONTROL BOARD
AND THE KIND OF THE DIAMOND IN THE CROWN JEWELS ITS POSITION IN BRITAIN IS LOOKING RATHER MORE SECURE NOT THAT IT WAS EVER REALLY INSECURE I SUPPOSE BUT THERE'S BEEN A CONCESSION FROM A RATHER UNEXPECTED SOURCE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT IN INDIA WHERE THE INDIAN SOLICITOR GENERAL HAS SAID THAT INDIA'S CLAIM ON THE COHEN THIS IS
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WANTED TO BE RETURNED TO INDIA THE CLAIM ON THE CORNER IS TENUOUS HE SAYS BECAUSE IT WAS NEITHER STOLEN OR FORCIBLY TAKEN AWAY HE HAS SAID THAT THE GEM WAS GIVEN TO THE BRITISH BY RANJIT SINGER A SIKH MAHARAJAH VOLUNTARILY AS COMPENSATION FOR HELP IN THE SEQUELS AND THEREFORE OF THE DIAMOND IS NOT A STOLEN OBJECT THIS IS REPORTED IN THE TIMES WHICH SAYS THIS IS THE CLOSEST INDIA HAS COME TO RELINQUISHING ITS CENTURY OLD CLAIM TO THE ONE HUNDRED FIVE CHARACTER
IT'S TEN PAST SIX AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN AMERICA
YES IT'S THE STATE OF NEW YORK'S TURN TODAY TO HAVE ITS EIGHT SAY ON AMERICA'S PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS VOTING WILL TAKE PLACE AND ITS REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES WATCHED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT AND I ASKED HIM FIRST HOW IT'S LOOKING IN NEW YORK FOR HILLARY CLINTON
YOU WANT TO A LIFE IN FEAR FOR THE U.S. I THINK YOU REMEMBER
IN NEW YORK IT'S THE KIND OF POLYGLOT POPULATION
DIVERSITY THAT HAS SERVED HER WELL IN THE PRIMARY RACES SO FAR ANY FATHERS TENDS TO DO
IN A WHITE ESTATE WITH BIG COLLEGE TOWNS AND LOTS OF STUDENTS
GUESSING THE BIG CRABS IN NEW YORK HE HELD A VERY BIG RALLY IN A PARK IN BROOKLYN OVER THE WEEKEND THERE WAS A BIG RALLY
YOU GO IN WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
YOU'RE TURNING THE PART HE BELIEVES THAT THE POOR AS WE UNDERESTIMATE THERE WILL BE A SURPRISE AND HOW IS DONALD TRUMP LOOKING COS THIS STATE HAS BEEN OR LEE'S NEW YORK CITY HAS BEEN TRICKY TERRITORY FOR HIM
IN THE FIVE BOROUGHS OF NEW YORK IS ONLY DANGEROUS DANGER IRELAND YOU SANDED THE CAMPAIGN ENOUGH STATE UP PLACES
ONE OF THE REASONS HE CHANCE TO ATTRACT PUT ASTERS INDEED WHEN YOU CANADA A REPUBLICAN PARTY GALA A BLACK OUT THERE LAST WEEK HE WAS BESIEGED BY PROTESTERS
OF FORTY SECOND STREET WHERE HE APPEARED SUCH OF VOID THAT IS SPENT
HE WILL WIN THIS PRIMARY THE QUESTION TO DONALD TRUMP IS HAPPY WILL BE STRICTLY
HE'S DEALING IN CURRENCY MICHELLE IT'S NOT DOLLARS IT'S DELICATE USED TO WHAT A LOT OF DELEGATES IN NEW YORK AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO WIN OVER FIFTY PERCENT
WHY HE'S EXPECTED TO DO THAT AND YOU'LL BE REALLY NEEDS TO WIN FIFTY
IN ALL THE TWENTY SEVEN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN NEW YORK
IF HE'S TO WIN NINETY FIVE DELEGATES ARE ON OFFER BUT EVEN IF WE WANT TO SAY
EIGHTY FIVE AT THE MOMENT REALLY HELP THESE ARE DELICATE MATTERS IT'S CALLED HE'S GOING TO GET
ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN DELICATE THAT'S THE MAGIC NUMBER TO WEIGH IN ON THE
THE NOMINATING RACE IN CLEVELAND OHIO WHERE THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WILL BE
IT WILL HELP HIS BACK TO DO THAT IS NARROW PART TO DO THAT IF HE DOES I'LL GET A HUGE WIN NICK BRYANT IN NEW YORK THANK YOU
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THE SPEECH THAT WE'LL HEAR LATER TODAY FROM MY GO FROM THE E.U. REFERENDUM BEFORE WE HEAR FROM HE GAVE THESE TALKING TO IS AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT MATTHEWS HERE WITH A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE ON THAT THANKS VERY MUCH NICK NOW THIS WAS SOMETHING WE TOUCHED ON YESTERDAY WHEN DAVID COMING UP STANDARD LIFE SAID THIS OF THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM ON MARKET SENTIMENT
MISSING EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS THE RECRUITMENT COMPANIES ALREADY SEEING A SLOWDOWN AND THERE'S SOME SOFTNESS AND CONSUMERS US WHETHER IT'S REFERENDUM LINK TO KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BUT THERE'S ALREADY A BIT OF A DRY
THERE ARE OTHER SIGNS TO B. B. C. UNDERSTANDS THAT SHORT TERM FUNDING COSTS FOR COMPANIES ARE GOING UP THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT TOP LEVEL LONDON PROPERTY SALES ARE SLOWING WHICH NOT EVERYBODY MIGHT THINK IS A BAD IDEA IT'S NOT A SURPRISE OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE REFERENDUM IS LEADING US SO WHETHER YOU'RE SOMEONE LOOKING TO BUY SOME EUROS NOW FOR YOUR SUMMER HOLIDAY OR AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM A COMPANY LOOKING TO MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. THE UNCERTAINTY DOES AFFECT SPENDING OR DOES IT WELL NEIL WILLIAMS SEES THE GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST AT HERMES INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT TOM STEVENSON HERE
INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL AS WELL OUR MARKETS GETS GOOD MORNING BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING NEIL FIRST WHICH MARKETS ARE AFFECTED AT THE MOMENT WELL ADAPTED TO THE BORROWER U. S. PHRASE BRECHT'S IF YOU LIKE IS THE KNOWN UNKNOWN FOR U.K. ASSETS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE BEGINNING TO TO TO TO LOOK ACROSS KNOWN TO JUNE BUT IT DOES PERHAPS IF ANYTHING SEEM AT THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM THE FOOTSIE REALLY
A YEAR TO DATE THE POUND IS THE PRESSURE RELEASE THAT'S OFF ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT SINCE THE SINCE THE AUTUMN AND WILL GET MORE STERLING WEAKNESS IT SEEMS TO ME BUT ALSO GOVERNMENT DEBT GUILTY EELS TEN YEAR BORROWING COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN PARKED ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PER CENT THAT'S LOW THAT'S LOWER THAN THE U.S. SO I AM EXPECTING SOME REACTION ESPECIALLY IF WE HIT A ROGUE POLL AS WE DID INTO SCOTLAND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FOR THE TIME BEING THINGS SEEM REASONABLY CALM TOM
YES THINGS ARE CALM BUT I THINK WHAT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK INTERESTING IS THE BID THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN LARGE INTERNATIONAL FOCUS COMPANIES THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MALT DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED FOOTSIE TOO FIFTY COMPANY SO OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS THE EMPHASIS HAS REALLY BEEN ON THOSE DOMESTIC COMPANIES THE U.K. ECONOMY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY ROBUST AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE
OIL AND COMMODITY EXPOSURE OF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE'VE HAD A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THAT AND THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AS WE'VE JUST HEARD HE'S HELD UP PRETTY WELL SINCE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR BUT THE DOMESTICALLY FOCUS STOCKS HAVE ACTUALLY STARTED TO UNDER PERFORM NEIL I MEAN YOU MENTIONED GILTS ITS GOVERNMENT BORROWING COSTS ARE THEY BEING AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE HAVING A REFERENDUM
AND NOT AS YET I'M SURE THEY WILL AND I THINK THE THOSE GOVERNMENT BORROWING COSTS TO THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE LESS PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THE THE SHORT TERM IMPACT ON EQUITY IS THE PAN SHOULD WE GET CLOSE TO A BRECHT HAD I THINK A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GUILT REACTION MAY BE TWOFOLD INITIALLY
GUILT ME ACTUALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THE BRICKS IT SUGGESTS A SNOWING ECONOMY MEANS THAT FIRST INTEREST RATE RISES PUSH BACK EVEN FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE BUT THE QUESTION I DON'T HAVE IS WHO'S GOING TO BUY THE GUILTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT BY THE THIRD OF THE ONE POINT THREE TRILLION POUNDS WORTH OF CONVENTIONAL GILLS ARE HELD BY INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS THEY WILL CARE ABOUT
CURRENCY RISK AS THE POUND FALLS AND THEY WILL CARE ABOUT CREDIT RATING SO I SO I WONDER IF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAY IN THAT CASE HAVE TO WHEEL OUT ITS QUANTITATIVE EASING AGAIN AND EVERYTHING THAT MEANS FOR LOW INTEREST RATES FOR EVEN LONGER BUT VERY BRIEFLY IT IS THAT A RISK
BEFORE THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE OF ITS BEING HELD OR AS A RESULT OF THE RESULT OF THE REFERENCE THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE TO BE A LAST RESORT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A RESULT OF BRECK'S IT BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE EVEN SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT REFERENDA DON'T PUT THE ISSUES TO BED SO WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS I THINK BEYOND THE NEXT TWO MONTHS ALMOST REGARDLESS OF THE RESULT LOVELY THANKS VERY MUCH
WE MOVE ON NOW TO THE U.S. BANKING SECTOR BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GET ANOTHER INSIGHT INTO ITS HEALTH TODAY MORGAN STANLEY ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY ITS QUARTERLY PROFIT MORE THAN HALVED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR LATER WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM GOLDMAN SACHS THEY'LL PUBLISH THEIR FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CHRISTOPHER WHEELER BANKS ANALYST AT ATLANTIC EQUITIES IS IN A PACKED STUDIO THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING MORNING THERE IS TALK THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST START TO THE YEAR FOR GOLDMAN SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHAT'S GONE WRONG
I THINK IT'S THE WORST START OF THE YEAR FOR MOST INVESTMENT BANKS SAME SORT OF PROBLEMS AS MORGAN STANLEY REFLECTED YES THE SAME AS MORGAN STANLEY J.P. MORGAN CITY BANK THAN COMMERICAL OF THE VEAL TO US AND YES THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE MARKETS HAVE BEEN BILLY BOY VOLATILE INVESTORS TOOK A LOT LET'S HAVE LESS WHISKY IF YOU WANT IN THE FIRST QUARTER IN FACT DIE WHISK THEIR PORTFOLIOS ISSUE AS THEREFORE PEOPLE ISSUING DEBT GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES AND PEOPLE LOOKING TO ISSUE EQUITY ALL STEP BACK FROM THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY WASN'T THE DEMAND SO NET NET IT WAS A BIT OF A PERFECT STORM
WHAT ABOUT REGULATION THE REGULATOR ENVIRONMENT IN THE STATES I MEAN IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT COULD BE TOUGH AND EVEN IN EVEN FURTHER WE HAD NEIL CASH CARRIED ONE OF THE THIRD PRESIDENTS IN MINNEAPOLIS SAYING IN A SPEECH COUPLE A MONTHS AGO THAT HE FELT THAT TOO BIG TO FAIL MEANT TOO BIG TO EXIST AND WAS QUESTIONING THE VERY EXISTENCE OF SOME OF THESE BANKS
YES I THINK REGULATION IS HE'S STILL LENT THIS IN THE UNITED STATES LAST WEEK WE HAD SO CALLED LIVING WILLS WERE A NUMBER OF THE BANKS REJECTED THIS IS THE PLAY AND YOU HAVE TO PUT FORWARD AS TO HOW YOU DO WITH YOURSELF IF A SORT OF LEHMAN INSTANT OCCURS IN YOU HAVE TO WIND YOURSELF DOWN MOST OF THE BIG BANKS HAD THOSE KICK BACK BY THE FADE WE ALSO TALKED A LOT YESTERDAY WITH MORGAN STANLEY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE STRESS TESTS THAT THE BANKS ARE PUT UNDER
IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GOING TO GO UP A NOTCH NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE THINGS THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR AND SO THIS MEANS THE BANKS HAVE TO KEEP EVEN MORE CAPITAL TO DEAL WITH POSSIBLE BIG PROBLEMS THAT THEY MAY FACE IN THE SLOWEST SITUATION A VERY QUICK ON THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE BUT NOT THOSE SITTING AT THEIR DESKS PERHAPS HER TRADING DESK TO THE CITY AT HOME BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS THINKING FANTASTIC THE BANKS HAVE FINALLY GET GOT WHAT'S COMING TO THEM I MEAN WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS AND MORGAN STANLEY RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS
NOT REALLY THEY'RE BIG BOYS AND I'M SURE THEY CAN MANAGE THEIR WAY OUT OF THOSE PROBLEMS BUT IT DOES MEAN UNFORTUNATELY IS THAT THE ONE THING YOU CAN CONTROL HIS COSTS AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS MEANING IF THEY HAVE TO DO SO THEY WILL CUT MORE HEADS AND THEIR BUSINESS IS FURTHER ALL RIGHT CHRIS THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ANOTHER COMPANY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US AN INDICATION OF HOW IT'S DOING LATER TODAY ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS BACK IN NOVEMBER WE FOUND OUT THE PROFITS HAD FALLEN BY THIRTY PER CENT
NOW AS WELL AS ITS GROCERY DIVISION THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS THE FASHION RETAILER PRIMARK AND MAUREEN HINTON GROUP RESEARCH DIRECTOR THAT VERDICT RETAIL IS ALSO HERE TOMORROW MORNING
I MEAN PRESUMABLY THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT FASHION IT'S A VERY SMALL PART OF ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS PORTFOLIO THAT FASHION CAN OFFSET ITS LOSSES IN THE FOOD SIDE IT IS QUITE A BIG PART OF IT F. NOW I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S GOING TO OFFSET ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN THE GROCERY SECTOR WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY VERY CHALLENGING BUT IT'S IS A VERY STRONG GROWTH STORY FOR A. B. F. AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME
WHY ARE YOU EXPECTING GOOD RESULTS FROM PRIMA I WANT SARAH'S EXPECTING A STRONG RESULTS FROM PRIMARK IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCE OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S GOT A VERY STRONG PROPOSITION WITH THIS LOW PRICES AND IT'S DOING A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION SO THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE BEING OUT HIS BIT HAS HAD A SLIGHTLY RESTRAINED GROWTH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS
WHETHER THAT LAST QUARTER WHICH MOST CLOTHING RETAILERS FOUND WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND ALSO IT BUYS IN U.S. DOLLARS AS MOST CLOTHING RETAILERS DO I OFFSHORE AND BECAUSE THE WEAKENING THAT'S HAVING A STRONG EFFECT ON ITS MARGINS THAT SHE'S ALREADY WARNED IT WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS MARGINS THIS QUARTER WE OFTEN REPORT ON THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT THE ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT WHERE COMPANIES LIKE PRIMARK HAVE THEIR CLOTHES MADE AND WHO MAKES THEM AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE PAID TO THOSE ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IMPACT THEIR BUSINESS IN THE LONG TERM
I THINK IT HAS A PROBLEM WITH PERCEPTION BECAUSE IT'S LOW PRICE THERE'S ALWAYS THIS PERCEPTION IT MUST BE EXPLOITING BUT HIS EYE WAS MANAGED THAT VERY WELL DONE OBVIOUSLY IT HAS TO BE BECAUSE IT'S A PUBLIC COMPANY IT'S GOT INVESTORS IN IT AND THEY ARE ALSO HAS THAT PUBLIC RECEPTION IT'S ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL ABOUT IT SAUCING O. K. MAUREEN THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE TOM STEVENSON AT FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL
WE SPOKE LAST WEEK ABOUT THE PROTEST THE REVOLT OVER B.P. SHAREHOLDERS OVER THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY AND THERE'S ANOTHER SMALLER ONE YESTERDAY AT CENTRICA FIFTEEN PERCENT OF VOTES CAST BY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF LARGE SHAREHOLDERS AHEAD OF THE ANNUAL MEETING WENT AGAINST THE PAY DEAL THEY'RE AWARDING THREE MILLION POUNDS OR SO TO IAN CON FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN AND YOU EXPECT THAT WE WE MIGHT SEE MORE SHAREHOLDERS COMPLAINING ABOUT C.
I THINK THIS IS IN SOME WAYS A BIT OF A THROWBACK TO THAT SHAREHOLDER SPRING OF FOUR YEARS AGO I THINK WE'VE GOT
POSSIBLY A FEW A FEW MORE IN THE PIPELINE YOU PLAINLY THE THE LEVEL OF A CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY HAS GROWN VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THAT THE THE AVERAGE IS NOW UP TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES THE AVERAGE PAY OF
THOSE CHIEF EXECUTIVES EMPLOYEES AND SAY THAT IS THAT IS A VERY WIDE DIFFERENTIAL AND I THINK THAT IF THAT IS NOT MATCHED BY DEMONSTRABLE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPANY'S THEN I THINK SHAREHOLDERS ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS REALLY A JUSTIFIABLE
AND DAISY SHAREHOLDERS CONCERN AND I MEAN I'M NOT I'M NOT ABOUT THE SMALL SHAREHOLDERS ACTUALLY I'M TALKING ABOUT BIG INVESTORS LIKE YOURSELVES IS IT THE SHAREHOLDERS CONCERN ABOUT INEQUALITY AND THEIR PAY DIFFERENTIALS HERE OR IS IT SHAREHOLDERS CONCERNED MORE ABOUT WELL IS THAT CHIEF EXECUTIVE REALLY WORTH THAT BEARING IN MIND THE HEAD WINS THE COMPANY'S FACE
I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE FACTORS BUT PLAINLY IF A COMPANY IS DOING BADLY AND WE SAW THIS WITH B. P. THERE JUST ANNOUNCED A VERY SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND THEN IF IN THE SAME BREATH THEY ANNOUNCE A HUGE RISE FOR THEIR CHIEF EXECUTIVE THEN THERE IS COOK PLAINLY AND INEQUITY THERE WHICH IS WHICH IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE
CAN I ASK ABOUT MET FLICKS MET FLICKS THIS MORNING WELL THEIR SHARES WERE DOWN NEARLY TEN PER CENT IN THE VIDEO STREAMING SERVICE IN MARKET TRADING ESTATE BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPECTING FEWER NEW SUBSCRIBERS THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF CHATTER ABOUT NET FLICKS THIS MORNING IT IS THERE A SENSE AMONG INVESTORS THAT TOO MANY INTERNET PROVIDERS OUT THERE IN THIS SORT OF AREA WELL I THINK IT IS BECOMING A VERY CROWDED SPACE ISN'T IT WE'VE WE'VE HAD AMAZON TED TALKING ABOUT STAND ALONE

MICHAEL GO IS ACCUSING THE REMAIN SIDE OF TREATING VOTERS LIKE CHILDREN IN A SPEECH IN LONDON TODAY HE'LL SAY THEY'RE USING PATRONISING ARGUMENTS AND SCAREMONGERING IT ALSO CALLED THE REFERENDUM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR PATRIOTIC RENEWAL
THERE REMAIN SIDE SAYS MY DOVE IS FOCUSING ON PROCESS BECAUSE THE OUT CAMPAIGN CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT BRITAIN MIGHT LOOK LIKE OUTSIDE THE E.U.
A GROUP OF M.P.S HAS PUBLISHED A REPORT SAYING BRITAIN HAS ENJOYED BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS BECAUSE OF ITS MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT COMMITTEE SAYS BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS HELPED TO REDUCE POLLUTION AND BOOST BIODIVERSITY AT THE EURO SCEPTIC M.P. PETER LILLEY HAS REFUSED TO SIGN THE DOCUMENT SAYING MANY OF THOSE WHO GAVE EVIDENCE A BIASED BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE E.U. FUNDING
A COMMONS COMMITTEE WILL TODAY HEAR EVIDENCE ABOUT THE SCALE AND IMPACT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND THE ENQUIRY COMES AS RESEARCH WERE THE WOMEN AND THE QUALITY'S COMMITTEE SAYS PUPILS ARE OFTEN BULLIED INTO SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND THAT MANY ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN SATURDAY'S EARTHQUAKE IN ECUADOR HAS RISEN TO FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN IT'S NOT YET CLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING RESCUE TEAMS SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF COLLAPSED BUILDINGS HAVE PULLED OUT A NUMBER OF SURVIVORS INCLUDING A NINE MONTH OLD BABY

NORMAN SMITH OR A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR IS WATCHING THE BLUES BEING TRADED MORNING TO YOU NORMAN RUNNING
WHAT OTHER THEN SAY WE'RE BEING TREATED LIKE CHILDREN WERE MY GAVE ZOE WELL AN AWFUL LOT AND I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHAT IS STRIKING ABOUT IT IT'S NOT JUST THE FEROCITY AND THE ABRASIVENESS OF THE LANGUAGE BEING USED BY MICHAEL GO MY GO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MORE POLITE AND RESTRAINED MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WEIGHING INTO HIS COLLEAGUES SAYING THEY VIEW BRITAIN HAS BEATEN AND BROKEN AND HAVING TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT IS THE SHEER BREADTH OF HIS ONSLAUGHT

THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE UNABLE TO RESIST YOU INTERFERENCE IN PENAL POLICY IN THE WAY OUR SECURITY SERVICES OPERATE IN TERMS OF ASYLUM LAW IN TERMS OF THE CITY
AND I THINK THAT REFLECTS THE NATURE OF THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BOTH IN THE ACRIMONIOUS WAITERS BEING FOUGHT WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE FACT THAT IT IS SPREADING OUT WAY BEYOND EUROPE SO WE HAD PRETTY PATEL YESTERDAY ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT OVER A SHORTAGE OF SCHOOL PLACES WE HAD JOHN WISHING DEL ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WILL'S DAD IAIN DUNCAN SMITH ATTACKING THE GOVERNMENT OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
IS IN EFFECT BECOMING A SURROGATE FOR A MUCH BROADER TORY CIVIL WAR STRIKING THAT MY GAVE OF ALL PEOPLE HIGHLIGHT IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT LEADING UP TO THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION AS A BROAD SENSE THAT THE UKIP BARRAGE COUNT WANTED TO MODERNISERS IN INVERTED COMMAS LIKE MARGO DIDN'T
THE SENSE WAS THAT THOSE AROUND MY WANTED TO PRESENT A MORE UPBEAT POSITIVE IMAGE AND NOT RETREAT INTO SORT OF THE THE THE FEAR OF EVER INCREASING IMMIGRATION
I SUSPECT THEY'RE POLING HAS SHOWED THEM THAT IMMIGRATION REMAINS A KEY DRIVER OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
AND THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE BEEN PRESENTING THE MORE UPBEAT IMAGES THEY ARE BEREFT OF DETAIL AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE TOLD TODAY THAT MISTER GOW WILL GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT BRITAIN WOULD LIKE THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE OUTSIDE THE E.U. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN COUNTER DOSSIER TO THE CHANCELLOR'S TREASURY DOCUMENT NOW AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WE DON'T HAVE A MASSIVE CIVIL SERVICE TO COME UP WITH ALL THESE COMPLEX ALGEBRA EQUATIONS BUT IT IS ALSO TACTICAL THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT ON THE LINE WHAT
BRITAIN WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THEY LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM WHERE THE SCOTTISH THE S.N.P. PRODUCED A WHITE PAPER
PRESENTING HIS TARGET NORMAN IS EASY TARGET FOR OTHERS TO PICK APART AND THEY DON'T WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE AGAIN SORRY CUP YACHTS NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IS ABOUT TO LOOK INTO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS WITH EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW SEXUALISED BEHAVIOUR IS MORE COMMONPLACE ROBERT PIGGOTT OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE WHAT DO WE KNOW ROBERT ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM THIS IS IN SCHOOLS
THERE WAS A MAJOR B.B.C. INQUIRY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHICH FOUND THIS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OF FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ALLEGED SEX CRIMES TO TAKE PLACE IN SCHOOLS INCLUDING SIX HUNDRED RAPES ON SCHOOL PREMISES AND THAT WAS AFTER DOING A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS TO ALL U.K. POLICE FORCES AND VARIOUS OTHER BODIES LIKE THE PIECES HE SAID THEY WEREN'T SURPRISE THEIR OWN RESEARCH HAD SET A SIMILAR THING SO THE COMMITTEE IS NOW GOING TO
GET EVIDENCE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED PARTIES BUT THEY'VE ALREADY CONSULTED THREE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE AGED OVER SIXTEEN BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE AND ASKED THEM ABOUT IT AND THEY HAVE GIVEN THE EVIDENCE THAT IT'S REALLY VERY COMMON SEXUALLY CHARGED BEHAVIOUR DETERMINING THE NATURE OF ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN PUPILS AND SCHOOL CORRIDORS AND PLAYGROUNDS
THEIR ENCOUNTERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL SEXTING AND PORNOGRAPHY BECOMING COMMONPLACE ARE NORMALISED AND PEOPLE FEELING UNDER PRESSURE TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE THEY'RE READY FOR FEAR OF BEING BRANDED FRIGID IT IS THAT IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT'S EASY TO GET WORKED UP ABOUT BUT LESS EASY TO SEE WHERE YOU MIGHT START IN ORDER TO TRY AND CHANGE THAT
THAT'S RIGHT TONIGHT I THINK THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE WAY IN WHICH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT SEX EDUCATION AT SCHOOLS IN QUITE A CRITICAL WAY SAYING IT WAS TOO SIMPLISTIC DIDN'T SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORE THE DIFFERENT SEXUALITIES AND GENDERS AND SO ON BUT THAT PERHAPS WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY FOSTERING WHAT THEY CALLED A LAD CULTURE
BALANCE HER BEHAVIOUR AND THE SENSE OF BOYS BEING IN SOME WAY ENTITLED TO GIRLS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE CONSULTED THESE THREE HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT IT SHOULD START EARLIER AND DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE CONSENT AND RISKY BEHAVIOUR THINGS LIKE SEXTING AND THIS DOES FOR ACTUALLY REFLECT A CALL BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR A COMPULSORY SEX EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE
CHAIR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE EDUCATION HEALTH HOME AFFAIRS AND BUSINESS COMMITTEES WROTE TO NIKKI WALKER THE RISK THE EDUCATION SECRETARY IN JANUARY CALLING FOR IT TO BECOME COMPULSORY PRIMARY SCHOOL AND SECONDARY SCHOOL BUT THE GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S KEEPING THAT UNDER REVIEW WILL BE SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORTS THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL BE LOOKING AT AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK ROBERT TAKE IT THANK YOU

AND THEY THEN SAID THAT ALL OF THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T GET TO THE SMALLER CRAFT THEY BELIEVE THEY ALL DIED BEHIND THEM THEY SAY AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED STORY THEN WENT ON OF ONE OF EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF SURVIVAL AS A FILIPINO FLAG VESSEL MANAGED TO PICK THEM UP AND BRING THEM HERE TO GREECE NOW YOU MIGHT THINK HAVING GOT TO LAND THEY'D BE SOMEWHAT RELIEVED AND EXHAUSTED AND TRAUMATISED BUT IN FACT THE OVERALL
FEELING WE GOT FROM THEM WAS ONE OF ANGER BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GET TO ITALY AND THEY WERE FURIOUS THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HERE TO GREECE WHICH KIND OF SHOWS YOU THE DETERMINATION THAT THEY HAD A BIT OF A JOURNEY THAT HAD PUT THEM THROUGH ALL SORTS OF HARDSHIP IN GUT LASTING SEVERAL WEEKS AND THEN WHAT

THE MALE ACCUSES GEORGE OSBORNE OF EMPLOYING A BLIZZARD OF SPURIOUS STATISTICS AND SOME TRULY CATACLYSMIC ECONOMIC FORECAST TO TERRIFY THE BRITISH PEOPLE INTO STAYING IN THE Y. YOU HOW ON EARTH COULD HE CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT THE ECONOMY WILL BE LIKE IN TWENTY THIRTY ASKS THE SUN SAYS ITS READERS ARE TOO SAVVY TO SWALLOW WHAT IT CALLS BOGUS FIGURES AND SAYS THEY'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADMISSION IN THE REPORT THAT THREE MILLION MORE MIGRANTS WILL ARRIVE IN THE U.K. IF IT REMAINS IN THE E.U.
THE MIRROR SAYS THAT GEORGE OSBORNE'S FIGURES ARE IFFY BUT COMMON SENSE REINFORCES THE ECONOMIC WARNINGS IN THE TREASURER'S REPORT THE FINANCIAL TIMES ACCUSES YOU OF SCEPTICS ARE BEING DELIBERATELY EVASIVE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF THE REPORT WHICH ARE DESCRIBED AS A CREDIBLE AND AUTHORITATIVE PIECE OF WORK IN ITS LEADER COLUMN THE PAPER SAYS THERE'S CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE MUST PROVIDE A SERIOUS RESPONSE AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT POST BRECHT'S IT TRADING ARRANGEMENTS THEY FAVOUR

THERE'S WIDESPREAD COVERAGE OF THE FUNERAL OF THE COMEDIAN RONNIE CORBETT IN WHAT THE EXPRESS CALLS A WITTY AND CHARMING TRIBUTE FOR CANDLES WERE LIT IN THE CHURCH IN A NOD TO ONE OF THE TWO RONNIES MOST FAMOUS ROUTINES WHEN A BUILDER IS PRESENTED WITH CANDLES AND A HARDWARE SHOP WHEN HE ASKED FOR FOUR CANDLES ACCORDING TO THE EYES SIR MICHAEL PARKINSON SAID AFTERWARDS THAT THE SERVICE HIT EXACTLY THE RIGHT NOTE THE STAR REPORTS THAT IT FEATURED A RECORDING OF MISTER CORBETT SINGING UP'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO WHICH ENDS WITH HIM SAYING THE WORDS GOD BLESS GOODNIGHT
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SIGNALLED TRAGICALLY I THINK THAT BRITAIN'S NEW POLAR RESEARCH SHIP WILL PROBABLY NEVER WEIGH ANCHOR HAS A S. BOATY MCB FACE THAT IS REPORTED IN THE GUARDIAN DESPITE OF COURSE THE NAME WINNING A PUBLIC VOTE A LEADING ASK ON THE TIMES URGES THOSE WITH THE FINAL SAY TO TREAD CAREFULLY THEY CHOSE TO GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN THEY MUST NOW LIVE WITH THE OUTCOME THE PAPER SAYS IT DOES HOWEVER CAUTION AGAINST THE BABY TURNING TO THE PUBLIC TO NAME ITS NEW AIRCRAFT CARRIER
WARSHIP E. MC WAR FACE IT WILL NOT IT SAYS DETER VLADIMIR PUTIN
THE TIME IS TWENTY TO SEVEN A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING A LEADING CAMPAIGNER FOR BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO BAZ ACCUSED THE REMAIN CAMP OF TREATING VOTERS LIKE CHILDREN WHO CAN BE FRIGHTENED INTO OBEDIENCE WAS CLAIMED YESTERDAY THAT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAD BACKED DOWN FROM PLANS TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND MY AUNT SAID THE REPORTS WERE ABSOLUTE NONSENSE BUT EM PEAS STILL HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR NEW WORKING HOURS HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN
IN FEBRUARY THE HEALTH SECRETARY TOLD EM PEAS THERE'D BE NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS THAT DIDN'T END THE DISPUTE OVER WORKING HOURS AND CONDITIONS AND LATER THIS MONTH DOCTORS ARE DUE TO HOLD THEIR FIRST ALL OUT STRIKE THE SUGGESTION THAT MISTER HUNT HAD CHANGED HIS POLICY
CAME AFTER LETTERS FROM GOVERNMENT LAWYERS SAID THE MINISTER WAS INTRODUCING A NEW CONTRACT THE LABOUR SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY HEIDI ALEXANDER ASKED AN URGENT QUESTION AND SAID THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY APPEARED TO BE IN COMPLETE DISARRAY
ON BEHALF OF PATIENTS I HAVE TO ASK HIM WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON
A STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWER TO A SIMPLE QUESTION IS HE IMPOSING A NEW CONTRA
YES OR NO
JEREMY HUNT GAVE A CLEAR ANSWER YES WE ARE IMPOSING A NEW CONTRACT AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH THE GREATEST OF REGRETS BECAUSE THE B.M.A. REFUSED TO TALK OVER THREE YEARS WITH THREE INDEPENDENT PROCESSES
HE WENT ON TO ACCUSE HEIDI ALEXANDER OF PLANTING THE STORY IN THAT MORNING'S GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER WHICH HAD SUGGESTED THAT MY HUNT HAD DROPPED HIS THREAT TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT DISMISSING LABOUR'S COMPLAINTS IS NIT PICKING LEGAL ISMS ARE CONSERVATIVE FORMER HEALTH SECRETARY KENNETH CLARKE SAID THE B.M.A. HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VERY MILITANT TRADE UNION
BUT IT HAS NEVER PREVIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED STRIKE ACTION WITHDRAWING URGENT SERVICES IN PURSUIT OF WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A PAY CLAIM
THE DISPUTE ONLY AFFECTS HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND BUT THE S. S.N.P. PEAS DOCTOR PHILIPPA WHITFORD OFFERED A DIAGNOSIS THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS DESCRIBED WITHIN THE SAME PAY ENVELOPE HAVING MORE DOCTORS THAT WE
NOT IF YOU WERE DURING THE WEEK REDUCING A MAXIMUM OF NINETY ONE HOURS TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS I DON'T SEE HOW THE MATHS OF THAT CAN POSSIBLY ADD
WHEN WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY MANAGING TO COVER THE ROUTE IS THAT WE HAVE AND THESE ROTOR GAPS ARE A DANGER TO PATIENTS
ANOTHER PARLIAMENTARY MEDIC THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE DOCTOR SARAH WALLASTON SAID PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY'D BE SAFE ON THE STRIKE DAYS I WONDER WHETHER THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL JOIN ME AND ALSO THE SHADOW SECRETARY OF STATE IN CALLING ON THE BEER MAKE AT LEAST TWO ACCENTS CASUALTY DEPARTMENTS THE MATERNITY UNIT
FROM THIS WALK OUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT EVEN WITH GOODWILL ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE TO BRING PEOPLE BACK WHERE HOSPITAL TO OVERWHELMED THE DELAYS AND COST LIVES
JEREMY HUNT AGREED WITH THIS SECOND OPINION THE DEPARTMENTS AT MOST RISK OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS MATERNITY DEPARTMENTS AND INTENSIVE CARE UNITS AND THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE ARE MOST KEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN CRITICAL DOCTOR COVER OVER THE TWO STRAIGHT DAYS THAT ARE PLANNED
LABOUR M.P. STELLA CREASY WANTED CLARITY A SHE'S LIKE HAS SAID TODAY THAT HE IS IMPOSING A CONTRACT IN CONTRAST TO WHAT HIS LEGAL TEAM ARE SAYING TO THE DOCTORS
HE FOUGHT AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT SET OUT EXPLICITLY WHAT LEGAL POWERS HE THINKS HE HAS TO DO
JEREMY HUNT SAID HE WAS INTRODUCING A NEW CONTRACT FROM THIS AUGUST THE REASON THAT WE DIDN'T IN THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT USED THE WORD IMPOSE WAS NOT A MATTER OF SEMANTICS BUT WE ARE PROCEEDING WITH THIS NEW CONTRACT AND EVERYONE WILL MOVE ON TO IT WHICH I THINK IS THE GIST OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE MEAN BUT BUT WE'RE NOT DOING IS CHANGING
EXISTING CONTRACTS SO WHEN PEOPLE MOVE TRUST OR MOVE TO A NEW POSITION THEY WILL MOVE ON TO A NEW CONTRACT AND THAT'S WHY WE USE THE PLACE INTRODUCTION OF NEW CONTRACTS
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT TOM BRAKE OPTED FOR THE LANGUAGE OF PSYCHOLOGY WE NEED CLOSURE ON THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' STRIKE FOR PATIENTS AND FOR DOCTORS TO ENABLE THE N.H.S. TO CONCENTRATES AS WELL ON ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROJECTED EIGHT BILLION POUND SHORTFALL IN THE N.H.S. THE G. P. OUT OF OUR SERVICES WHICH ARE UNDER REAL PRESSURE
THE WORST EVER N.H.S. PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THIS YEAR AND ALSO THE LONG TERM THREAT TO THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OUR WHOLE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE SISTER OVER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS THE LABOUR PEER TELEVISION PRESENTER AND FERTILITY EXPERT LORD WINSTON SAID THE GREAT MAJORITY OF JUNIOR DOCTORS WERE DEEPLY ALTRUISTIC ONE OF THE RISKS IS THE LONG TERM DAMAGE NOT JUST TO THE WHOLE SERVICE BUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING OF COMING INTO THE HEALTH SERVICE
FUTURE THE YOUNG PEOPLE I SEE UNIVERSITY UNEVEN AND SCHOOLS WERE ASKING ME SHOULD I ACTUALLY BE DOING MATHS
THE HEALTH MINISTER LORD PRIOR STRUCK A CONCILIATORY NOTE HE SAID MEDICINE WAS A WONDERFUL VACATION WHICH ATTRACTED SOME OF THE BEST AND FINEST YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY

HIT AREAS WE'VE HAD TO TAKE DIVERGENCE BECAUSE THEY MADE ROADS HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND ALONG THE WAY HE'D HAVE BEEN A FEW LANDSLIDES BUT IT WAS WHICH COULD BE BECAUSE OF THE WET WEATHER BUT IT STILL HAMPERING RELIEF EFFORTS HAS BEEN A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN WE GOT TO THE TOWN OF CARDAMON WHICH IS JUST OVER AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE COAST AND ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE BUILDINGS LOOKED INTACT THERE WERE SIGNS OF DEVASTATION AND I SPOKE TO RESCUE WORKERS THERE AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BADLY AFFECTED

FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S COMPLETE DEVASTATION SPEAKING TO PEOPLE HERE IN THE COMMUNITY THERE WOULD BE WARNINGS PEOPLE YOU'VE SPOKEN TO SAID YOU SHOULDN'T BE GOING THERE BECAUSE THE CONCERN OF A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE WHO STILL HAVEN'T BE RESCUED AND HEALTH CONCERNS BUT AS WELL I'VE JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO A WAITER IN A HOTEL WHO SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSAULTS THERE'S BEEN LOOTING IT'S A SECURITY SITUATION I THINK IS A CONCERN

THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN SEVERAL MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL CENTRES HAVE TRIED TO GIVE THEMSELVES A SHOT IN THE ARM THROUGH ARTS AND CULTURE NOW SUNDERLAND IS TRYING TO FOLLOW SUIT IT'S ONE OF ABOUT HALF A DOZEN TOWNS AND CITIES COMPETING TO BE U.K. CITY OF CULTURE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS PART OF AN OCCASIONAL SERIES ON THE RUNNERS FOR THE TITLE NICK HIGHAM REPORTS FROM WEARSIDE
STUKA LADIES OF HILTON THE UCS TWENTY OF THEM MOSTLY IN THEIR SEVENTIES PACKED INTO HILTON CASTLE WORKING MEN'S CLUB
BENEFICIARIES OF AN ARTS COUNCIL SCHEME WHICH TARGETS MONEY BUT PLACES WHERE PARTICIPATION IN THE ARTS IS LOW IN SUNDERLAND THEY CALL THE SCHEME CULTURAL SPRAY
FOR ME A CULTURAL SPRING HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS AREA TO ENGAGE PEOPLE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE KIND OF CULTURAL LIFE THEY WANT TO HAVE IN THE AREA
REBECCA BALL USED TO RUN THE CULTURAL SPRING NOW SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF SUNDERLAND'S BID TO BE U.K. CITY OF CULTURE THAT'S A REALLY GOOD STARTING POINT FOR CITY OF CULTURE BECAUSE CITY OF CULTURE NEEDS TO BE ABOUT IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY OWNED IN THE AREA BY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
THE MOTOR TANGO BOGS DONE BIGGER SHIP EVER BUILT ON THE NORTH EAST COAST
THE WHOLE OF NEW IDEA ONCE SUNDERLAND WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST SHIPBUILDING TERMS IN THE WORLD IT HAD GLASS FACTORIES AND COALMINES TO UNTIL ONE BY ONE THEY CLOSED THE LAST SHIPYARD WENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE'RE LOOKING FOR
CHERRY RED HEAT REALLY EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THE NATIONAL GLASS CENTRE OPENED ON THE SITE OF ONE OF THE SHIPYARDS
CENTRE WAS AN EARLY ATTEMPT AT REGENERATING POST INDUSTRIAL SUNDERLAND YOU BRING IT OVER HERE TO A TABLE LITTLE METAL LIFE DID YOU
IT JUST COMES CLEAR VISITORS CAN ADMIRE DISPLAYS OF DECORATIVE GLASS
WATCH DEMONSTRATIONS BY GLASSMAKER JAMES MAY
HE THINKS SUNDERLAND'S MORE THAN READY TO BE CITY OF CULTURE I THINK SOMEONE'S ALWAYS BIG
A FANTASTIC PLACE FOR MAKING
MAKING THINGS WILL THEY BE JOHN
CERAMICS GLASS NO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A VERY CREATIVE PLACE SOME VERY INDUSTRIOUS AND I THINK WE'RE NOW MOVING INTO
A TIME WHERE THAT'S WORKING
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WE'RE HERE AT ONE END OF SUNDERLAND'S HIGH STREET I WAS SHOWN ANOTHER CULTURAL REGENERATION SCHEME
THE CITY'S OLD FIRE STATION IS TO BECOME AN ART CENTRE AT THE HEART OF A NEW MAC QUARTER IT STONES FOR MUSIC AND CULTURE
LOCAL BUSINESSMAN PAUL CALLAGHAN IS A MEMBER OF THE MAC TRUST OR BELIEVE THAT ANY PLACE NEEDS TO HAVE A CULTURAL SOUL A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN
DEVELOP THE CULTURAL TALENTS CAN SEE GREAT
CAN PARTICIPATE AND SHAPE THE PLACE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE
FRANK YOU HEARTSTRINGS AS SUNDERLAND'S MOST PROMINENT LOCAL BAND
THEY'VE ALSO BRANCHED OUT AND LAUNCHED POP REX A CROWD FUNDED POP UP RECORD STORE COME ARTISTS HANG OUT AND THEY'RE FIRMLY BEHIND THE CITY OF CULTURE
DAVE HARPER IS THE BAND'S DRUMMER ROSS MILLARD THE GUITAR
IT WAS LIKE THAT YOU'VE BEEN AND WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM IT AND IT WAS
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HUGE POSSIBLE STEP FORWARD TO MAKE IN THIS CITY
I DIDN'T HAVEN'T HAVING THIS HE RECOGNISED SUIT SOMETIMES PATRONISED QUITE A LOT OF THE TIME IN OR FORGOTTEN ABOUT
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE CITY OF COURSE YOU GO FOR IT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE IN THE POT WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF THE NAMES PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE CHALLENGE IS GO ON THEN WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
THAT WAS NICK HIGHAM REPORTING THE TIME THEY'RE SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A CASHLESS ERA THE CO OP SUPERMARKET BELIEVES THAT PAYMENTS VIA MOBILE PHONES WILL OUTSTRIP CASH WITHIN A DECADE CONTACTLESS CARD PAYMENTS MEANWHILE HAVE TREBLED IN A YEAR AS THE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE WE'RE JOINED BY RICHARD LLOYD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH GOOD MORNING MORNING MISSION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CO OP'S ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL OF MOBILE PHONE PAYMENTS
WELL THIS WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY SHIFT IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR AND TO BE FAIR TO THEM AS HE SAID THERE HAS BEEN A REALLY PHENOMENAL RISE IN THE USE OF CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS IN PARTICULAR CARDS BUT THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE WE'VE ALL JUST BEEN ISSUED WITH THEM OVER THE LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN MORE CONTACTLESS PAYMENT CARDS IN CIRCULATION THAN EVER BEFORE
MORE RETAILERS ARE OFFERING THAT AS A SERVICE BUT I THINK TO EXTRAPOLATE FROM THAT THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SOMEHOW USE OUR SMARTPHONES TO REPLACE CASH FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF SMALL PURCHASES I THINK AGAIN ABOUT THE PROSPECT DO YOU NOT DO YOU NOT THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
I THINK IT IS REALLY CONVENIENT AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY WILL BE BY MY SANDWICH WITH A CONTACTLESS CARD AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WE'VE ASKED ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY FOR IN TEN PEOPLE WE ASKED SAID THEY ALREADY HAVE A CONTACTLESS CARD NOT A PHONE BUT A CARD AND THEY DON'T USE IT BECAUSE OF WORRIES ABOUT THE CREDIT CARD AND CARD SECURITY FRAUD IN THE ROUNDS OF THE BANKS
THE INDUSTRY THE PAYMENT SYSTEM INDUSTRY HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS A SAFE AND SECURE PAYMENT METHOD THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S PREDICTION IS UNREALISTIC THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS AS AS SAYING THAT THERE IS A HIGHER RISK OF FRAUD WITH THESE CONTACT THERE'S METHODS OF PAYMENT PEOPLE MAY WORRY ABOUT IT BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE IS IT THAT'S TRUE ACTUALLY REPORTED FRAUD IS FAIRLY LOW FOR CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS OBVIOUSLY IT'S EARLY DAYS IT'S ONLY JUST BEING ADOPTED AT THIS RATE
BUT PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION IS THAT AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF YOUR CARD DETAILS BEING OBTAINED BY PEOPLE USING READERS NEARBY THAT IS A FAIRLY REMOTE POSSIBILITY BUT PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF A LACK OF SECURITY I THINK WILL MEAN THAT THIS RAPID RISE IN THE USE OF CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS WILL LEVEL OFF AND IT'S UNLIKELY TO REPLACE CASH IN PARTICULAR FOR THOSE SMALL PAYMENTS IN SUPERMARKETS POPS NEWSAGENTS
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS THIS MOSTLY OLDER PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF OF OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD YOU FOR THOSE WHO ARE GROWING UP IN THIS ERA WHERE WHERE WHERE THESE METHODS OF PAYMENT ARE MORE COMMONPLACE DO THEY THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THEM THERE IS A GREATER DEGREE OF CONCERN AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE ABOUT SECURITY AND ABOUT FRAUD IN THE ROUND TO YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE WITH USING THEIR SMARTPHONES TO PAY FOR THINGS
SO THAT RATE OF ADOPTION WILL INCREASE AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION STARTS TO USE IT BUT I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR POORER HOUSEHOLDS FOR WHOM CASH IS STILL THE ONLY PAYMENT THAT THEY USE NEARLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ONLY USE CASH SO I THINK WE'RE A MILE AWAY FROM BEING A CASHLESS SOCIETY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER WOULDN'T IT FOR TAX COLLECTION FOR EXAMPLE REDUCING THE POTENTIAL FOR FOR PEOPLE TO TO PAY FOR THINGS IN CASH SERVICES AND CASH
I THINK THERE'S HUGE POTENTIAL HERE IN THE ROUND THE ECONOMY OVERALL WE'VE NOW SHIFTED TO A MAJORITY OF DIGITAL PAYMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR THAT INCLUDES BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSFERS AS WELL AS CONSUMER PAYMENTS SO THERE ARE HUGE ADVANTAGES TO THIS AND OBVIOUSLY BANKS AND RETAILERS WHO WOULD DEARLY LOVE US TAUGHT ALL ADOPT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IT'S CHEAPER FOR THEM AS WELL
SO I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF ADVANTAGES IT IS CONVENIENT BUT UNTIL THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS A DRESS THAT FEAR THAT PERCEPTION OF A LACK OF SECURITY THEN WE WILL STILL BE USING CASH FOR A LOT OF SMALL PURCHASE RICHARD LLOYD OF WHICH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH TOM CHEF ANNEKA NICK THANK YOU WORLD NOT MUCH HAPPENING ON THE WEATHER FRONT ACTUALLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS TODAY SHOULD BE A FINE DAY THERE'S A BIT OF CLOUD AROUND

DON'T LOOK AT IT THEN BUT I'M NOT GOING OVER ON THE BUDGET THE WORK FOR RESCUE IS ENORMOUS I CAME ACROSS A GROUP FROM QUITO FROM THE RED CROSS WHO WERE MORE A SLEEK BEEN AWAKE BUT MOTIVATED TO WORK BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN WORKING ALL NIGHT WE SHOULD FEEL PROUD OF OUR RESCUERS ALSO FOR A LATIN AMERICAN BROTHERS WHO HAVE HELPED US VENEZUELANS COLOMBIANS FROM MANY OTHER PLACES
DOCTORS SAY THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA WHO WERE TREATED WITH A COMBINATION OF TWO IMMUNO THERAPY DRUGS IN A TRIAL SURVIVED FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS THE STUDY OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FORTY PATIENTS ALSO FOUND THAT A FIFTH OF THEM HAD NO MORE SIGNS OF TUMOURS AFTER RECEIVING THE DRUGS EPILIM OOH MAD AND MY VOL A MAP A HEALTH REPORTER JAMES GALLAGHER HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THEIR FINDINGS
A PILLAR MOVE VOLLER AMAR BOOST THE ABILITY OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ATTACK CANCERS BOTH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AS TREATMENTS FOR MELANOMA ON THE N.H.S. BUT MOST RESEARCHERS BELIEVE COMBINATION THERAPY WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GIVE PATIENTS THE BEST CHANCE OF SURVIVAL DATA FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PATIENTS GIVEN BOTH DRUGS SHOWED SIXTY NINE PER CENT WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER TWO YEARS AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT HAD NO SIGN OF TUMOURS IN THEIR BODY
THE POTENTIAL OF THESE DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED WIDELY AND A MUCH LARGER TRIAL INVOLVING NEARLY ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS IS ALREADY UNDERWAY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO SURVIVAL FIGURES AND DOCTORS SAY THE DATA IS VERY ENCOURAGING CANCER RESEARCH U.K. SAID THE STEADY GAVE NEW HOPE TO PATIENTS BUT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HALF OF PEOPLE IN THE TRIAL HAD SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS
THE CANDIDATES FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY HAVE BEEN MAKING A FINAL PUSH FOR VOTES IN NEW YORK THE HEAD OF CRUCIAL PRIMARIES THEY'RE LATER TODAY THE DEMOCRATS FRONT RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON TOLD VOTERS SHE WASN'T TAKING ANYTHING FOR GRANTED IN SPITE OF HER STRONG OPINION POLL RATINGS FOR THE REPUBLICANS DONALD TRUMP HELD A RALLY STRESSING HIS LOVE OF NEW YORK HIS MAIN RIVAL TED CRUISE IS NOT EXPECTED TO DO WELL AFTER CRITICISING MY TRUMP'S NEW YORK VALUES EARLIER IN THE CAMPAIGN
A REPLICA OF AN ANCIENT ARCH WHICH WAS DESTROYED BY MILITANTS FROM THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN THE SYRIAN CITY OF PALMYRA WILL BE UNVEILED IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE THIS MORNING THE COPY OF THE TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD ARCH OF TRIUMPH HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE INSTITUTE FOR DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY USING THREE.D. PRINTING TECHNIQUES AND MARBLED DONATED BY THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT ROGER MICHAEL IS FROM THE INSTITUTE HE SAYS THE REPLICA HAS BEEN MADE IN UNPRECEDENTED DETAIL
I THINK THIS MAY BE THE MOST EXACT REPRODUCTION OF ANY CLASSICAL STRUCTURE EVER MADE THEY'VE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO INCLUDE
BIRD'S NEST IT WAS ON THE STRUCTURE IN THE REPRODUCTION THAT WE'RE MAKING BEHIND
WE USE THAT THREE.D. RENDERINGS OF THESE IMAGES DERIVED FROM THOUSANDS OF TILNEY AND THREE.D. IMAGES
TO PRODUCE THE MOST ACCURATE PASSABLE RENDITION OF THE ORIGINAL
A STUDY HAS SUGGESTED THE DINOSAURS WERE DYING OUT FIFTY MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE ASTEROID IMPACT THAT'S BEEN BLAMED FOR WIPING THEM OUT AND YOU ASSESSMENT FROM RESEARCHERS AT READING AND BRISTOL UNIVERSITY'S CHALLENGES THEIR VIEW THAT THEY WERE FLOURISHING RIGHT UP UNTIL THE ASTEROID HIT HERE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT POLLARD GAUCHE
DINOSAURS ONCE DOMINATED THE PLANET BUT SIXTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO AN ASTEROID HIT THE EARTH AND WIPED THEM OUT WERE IT NOT FOR THAT CATACLYSMIC EVENT WOULD THEY STILL BE AROUND TODAY PROBABLY NOT ACCORDING TO HER NEW ANALYSIS OF DINOSAUR FOSSILS IT SHOWS THAT SPECIES WERE DECLINING FOR THE FIFTY MILLION YEARS LEADING UP TO THE IMPACT
A LOT OF SPECIES WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE BREAKING UP OF THE PLANET'S CONTINENTS CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL AND A COOLING OF THE EARTH'S CLIMATE THIS SUGGESTS THE EARLY MAMMALS WHICH EVOLUTIONARY ANCESTORS WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND EVEN WITHOUT THE EARTH'S CHANCE COLLISION WITH THE ASTEROID MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
PULL UP GHOST REPORTING THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN SEXUALISED BEHAVIOUR IS THE NEW SOCIAL NORM IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES THE FINDING OF A SURVEY THAT M.P.S ON THE WOMEN INEQUALITIES COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT AS THEY BEGIN THEIR FIRST PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY INTO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS LAST YEAR A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT IN THE THREE YEARS UP TO TWENTY FOURTEEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTS IN U.K. SCHOOLS WERE REPORTED TO POLICE
WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM SOUTHAMPTON BY MAGGIE MORGAN FROM THE CHARITY FIXES WHICH CONDUCTOR THE RESEARCH FOR THE COMMITTEE AND IN THE STUDIO HERE BY SONIA LIVINGSTONE PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MAGGIE MORGAN WHEN YOU QUESTIONED YOUNG PEOPLE FOR YOUR SURVEY WHAT SORTS OF THINGS DID THEY SAY
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE MAIN PROBLEMS AND ALSO COME UP WITH THREE KEY SOLUTION AREAS BECAUSE THEY
DO YOU ADMIT THAT LIFE FOR THEM NOW IS MUCH MORE SEXUALISED IN THEIR VIEW THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND HIS IS CAUSING THEM PROBLEMS THEY THEY SEE THAT THEIR EXPOSURE TO TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY MEDIA HAS
REALLY LED THEM TO HAVE NEW SEXUAL ATTITUDES IT'S ALSO OF COURSE A VEHICLE TO TO SPREAD SEXUALISED CONTENT AND INTERESTINGLY THEY SAY THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES IT'S REINSTALLED THEY'RE RE INSTALLED ON THEIR BRAINS DAILY WITHOUT EVEN SEARCHING FOR IT JUST FROM SCROLLING THROUGH THEN USE FEATS I APPRECIATE IT'S NOT EASY TO TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF WHAT OF WHAT YOU FOUND ON A PROGRAMME AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING BUT WHY ARE YOU SHOCKED BY SOME OF WHAT YOU HEARD
PERSONALLY AND I THINK PERHAPS OTHER PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT FOR EXAMPLE SEXTING THE SHARING OF SEXUALISED IMAGES IS VERY MUCH CONSIDERED A NORM IN ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO YOUNG PEOPLE NOW IT'S EXPECTED THERE'S AN INEVITABILITY TO IT THEY THEY THEY APPRECIATE
IN THEIR VIEWS THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS THEY JUST MUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T DO IT TOO EARLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT READY AND THAT THEY MUST BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IF THE PICTURES GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS IT COULD CAUSE THEM ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES COULD EVEN LEAD TO SUICIDAL THOUGHTS SADLY PROFESSOR LIVINGSTONE DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT THERE IS AN INEVITABILITY ABOUT THE SHARING OF SEXUAL IMAGES VIA TEXT AND IS THAT HARMFUL
I THINK PERHAPS YES IT HAS BECOME A PART BECAUSE EVERY EVERY YOUNG PERSON NOW HAS A PHONE IN THE HAND AND THAT HAS A CAMERA AND IT RECEIVES IMAGES I CAN SEE THAT WHATEVER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE EATING WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING THAT THERE CHATTING ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE
AND INCLUDING THE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND SEXUAL CONVERSATIONS THAT GO ON AROUND THEM AND EVERYTHING'S BECOMING IN SOMEWAY RECORDED AND SHARED AND MADE VISIBLE BOTH THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS AND IN A WAY IT'S THAT VISIBILITY THAT ADDS TO THE PRESSURE THAT CLEARLY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT HE'S SHOWN VERY CLEARLY AND IN THEIR SUPPORT HOOD BUT IF IT WHAT IS THE WAY THEN TO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAPPENS WITHIN THE RIGHT BOUNDARIES
WELL I THINK I MEAN WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT THIS REPORT IN A WAY IS THAT IT'S ONE IN A SERIES OF REPORTS WE'VE HAD OVER RECENT YEARS WHICH HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR BETTER SOCIAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS FOR MORE SUPPORT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM PARENTS AND FOR EFFORTS TO CHANGE THAT KIND OF VERY SEXUALISED MEDIA CULTURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE IN WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY THAN INSECTS HAVE SEX EDUCATION
GIVE IT A LOT MORE TIME GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE A LOT MORE RESPECT LISTEN TO THEIR PERSPECTIVES STARTING MUCH EARLIER I THINK
FIVE BUT THEY START AT SCHOOL I MEAN SOME KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT RESPECT FOR THEIR BODIES
BUT WAY WAYS OF WAYS OF OPENING UP A CONVERSATION SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THAT TEACHERS ARE SUMMONED TO BE TRUSTED WHEN SOMETHING PROBLEMATIC HAPPENS OR WHEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY YOU CHANGE THE CURRICULUM AS IT AS IT GOT OLDER BUT I THINK YOU CAN BE LED BY YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE TALKING ABOUT WHEN A MAGGIE MORGAN YOU SAID THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE YOU TALK TO ALSO IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THAT
WELL IN REGARD TO SEX EDUCATION THEY FEEL IT'S IT'S TOO ONE DIMENSIONAL IT DOESN'T EXPLORE DIFFERENT GENDERS DIFFERENT SEXUALITIES EVEN SEXUAL PLEASURE AND THAT A LACK OF APPRECIATION OF SEX AS A COMPLEX ACT IS ALLOWING THEM TO SLIP INTO REALLY SIMPLISTIC
WHAT THEY'RE CALLING LAD CULTURE BEHAVIOUR IT'S JUST BANTER AND ALSO A SENSE OF A BOY'S HAVING AN ENTITLEMENT TO GIRLS DID YOU THEN WERE YOU LEFT HER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE THE BEHAVIOUR OF BOYS IS MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN THE BEHAVIOUR OF GIRLS
I THINK IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM BUT THERE WERE EXAMPLES WHERE YOUNG GIRLS HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEING SEXUALLY ISSUE ASSAULTED
WITHIN SCHOOL BY ARTHUR YOUNG WOMEN AND
MATTERS BEING REALLY BRUSHED ASIDE NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND WHICH HAS LED TO SOME YOUNG PEOPLE BEING VERY CONFUSED THAT PERHAPS THEY WERE AT FAULT
THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE THAT THEY APPRECIATE THAT TEACHERS ARE NOT REALLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH WITH THESE ISSUES WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE SOME EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS AS TO WHY SOMETHING'S HAPPENED WHY A YOUNG PERSON MIGHT FEEL PRESSURED I JUST WANT TO GET A FINAL THOUGHT IN FROM PROFESSOR LIVINGSTONE DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO ACCEPT THAT THAT THIS SEXUALISATION EXISTS RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGHT IT I MEAN AS US AS A SOCIETY
I THINK WE SHOULD ACCEPT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BECOME INTERESTED IN SEXUALITY AND THAT AS A SOCIETY WE HAVEN'T CREATED ANY KIND OF SPACE WHERE THEY CAN EXPLORE THAT JUST MENTALLY AND SO THEY THEY'RE DOING IT IT WOULD BE IN A VERY IMMEDIATE ICE FRAME BUT JUST JUST TO KIND OF ADD ONE CRUCIAL POINT FROM THIS REPORT AND I THINK FOR THEIR AND PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IT'S NOT JUST A SEXUALISED EXPERIENCE BUT HE'S ALSO THE LINKED TO VIOLENCE ON THE SENSE OF COERCION
THAT I THINK IS REALLY PILING ON THE PRESSURE ON YOUNG PEOPLE NERVOUS OR SONIA LIVINGSTONE AND MAGGIE MORGAN FROM THE CHARITY FIXERS THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU IT'S A CUTTER BAR SEVEN LET'S GET BACK TO SOME BUSINESS NEWS THE SANDWICH CHAIN PRITT A MOSH THAT'S PUT OUT ITS RESULTS AND HERE IS MATTHEW WITH THEIR MOUTH FULL OF THEM I WAS YEAH I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO CHEW ON BUT YOU KIND OF BEAT ME TO THE REALLY BAD JOKE AT THE MOMENT THANKS FOR THAT NICK
HERE YOU GO THEN THE NUMBERS PROCESS TOTAL SALES LAST YEAR AROSE ALMOST FOURTEEN PERCENT TO JUST OVER SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION POUND SALES IN SHOPS OPEN AT LEAST A YEAR ROSE SEVEN POINT FIVE PER CENT OPERATING PROFITS UP FOURTEEN POINT FOUR PER CENT THAT TAKES THEM TO PITIFUL POINT
TWO MILLION CLIVE SURELY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND BUILT ON THE BACK OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING QUITE A LOT OF SUCCESS IN THAT IN WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE HEALTHY EATING MARKET
YES HE'S TWO MAIN THINGS DRIVING TO BUSINESS THE DRIVE TO HEALTHY EATING HE'S BEEN VERY NOTICEABLE A BIGGER CELL INGREDIENT WAS AVOCADO IT'S OLD OVER MORE THAN FIVE MILLION WE CUT THOSE UP IN OUR SHOPS OURSELVES AND CUSTOMERS ARE MOVING MORE MORE TOWARDS PROTEIN POTS PLANT POTS AND THAT SORT OF THING AND THAT'S HELPING QUITE A LOT SO AWAY FROM MEAT
AS A VEGETARIAN WHO'S GOING FASTER THAN ME STILL A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR DIET BUT IT IS GOING FASTER AND PUT ITSELF IS ENCOURAGING VEGETARIANISM BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE MEAT IS MEAT EATERS OPTIONS AS WELL I THINK THE VEGETARIAN FOOD COULD LOOK BETTER AND BE BETTER AND GIVE PEOPLE MORE CHOICE
OR YOUR SALES UP BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING OR ARE THEY UP BECAUSE PUT THE PRICES HAVE GONE UP I NOTED THAT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO YOU PUT UP THE PRICE OF COFFEE BY TEN P. NO OURSELVES LATER DRIVEN BY TRANSACTION SO MORE PEOPLE COMING TO THE SHOPS ARE PRICING HE'S BEEN SOMEWHERE AFTER SENT FOR
A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS OR SO IT'S NOT A BIG CHANGE IN THAT BUT BUT ARE NEVERTHELESS WHEN WHEN THE COFFEE PRICES WENT UP BY TEN P. YOU KNOW THERE WERE STATEMENT COMING FROM THE COMPANY SAYING THAT WE'RE HAVING TO PUT THESE UP BECAUSE THE COST OF THE INGREDIENTS WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT FOOD PRICES GENERALLY HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN OR HAVE BEEN STABLE BUT ALSO INTERESTING THE COST OF STAFF SO HAS THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE AT FED THROUGH DIRECTLY INTO PRICES FOR THE CONSUMER
THE LIVING THE LIVING LIVING WAGES PUT A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE ON PRATS ON THIS WAGE BILL BUT WE ARE VERY CARING ABOUT ENSURING OUR STAFF ARE FULLY ENGAGED AND HOW WELL THEY WORK THEY DO SEMI JOBS EVERY DAY IN THIS THEY'VE TOTALLY COMMITTED THEY WON'T BE VERY IMPORTANT TO US SO WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO KEEPING THAT KEEPING ON A PAY WELL ABOVE THE COMPETITION AND THAT'S WORKED WELL FOR US ALL RIGHT CLIVE SLEEP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF PREP THANKS VERY MUCH
IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN HOW CAN PLANES BE PROTECTED FROM COLLISIONS WERE DRONES A QUESTION BEING ASKED OF COURSE AFTER A DRONE STRUCK A PLANE ON ITS DESCENT INTO HEATHROW ON SUNDAY ONE POSSIBLE ANSWER WE'RE TOLD HIS SO CALLED GEO FENCING THAT'S A CLEVER BIT OF SOFTWARE WHICH USES G.P.S. COORDINATES TO CREATE WHAT IS IN EFFECT OLD NO FLY ZONE FOR DRONES ARE MANDY KNOWS ABOUT THAT IS PETER LEE FROM TAYLOR VINTNERS LAW FIRM IN CAMBRIDGE AND I'M TOLD PETER I DIDN'T KNOW SUCH A THING EXISTED
YOU'RE A TECHNOLOGY IN DRONE LAWYER SET CORRECT GOOD MORNING I'M NOT
I GOT QUITE UNIQUE I'M A RARE BREED THAT'S RIGHT HE DID THAT'S ENOUGH IN OTHER WORDS IN THIS AS IT WERE KEEP YOU FULLY OCCUPIED THERE'S ENOUGH LAW IN THIS THERE'S ENOUGH CONTENTION IN THIS
THERE'S PLENTY OF LAW I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S ALL THE REGULATION THERE'S THE THE PRIVACY AND IT'S PROTECTION ANGLES NOSEY THE HUGE ETHICS PART AS WELL SO VERY INTERESTING SO WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ON DRONE USERS AS TO WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO WHERE THEY CAN AND CAN'T FLY WHEN THE CASE IS ACTUALLY QUITE CLEARLY YOU'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN THE DRONE WITHIN YOUR VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT YOU CAN'T FLY HIGHER THAN FOUR HUNDRED FEET
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP AWAY FROM PORTS AND AIRFIELDS AND YOU'VE REALLY GOT BASICALLY USE YOUR COMMON SENSE KEEP KEEP AWAY FROM PEOPLE KEEP AWAY FROM CONGESTED AREAS OR URBAN ENVIRONMENTS ESSENTIALLY AND HOW HELPFUL MIKE THIS TECHNOLOGY I DESCRIBED B. FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CO OPERATE PEOPLE ARE NOT AS IT WERE DELIBERATELY CAUSING DROP
I THINK SO HE SAID IF WE SET ASIDE PROFESSIONAL DRONE OPERATORS AND THE RESPONSIBLE HOBBYISTS I THINK I THINK YOU'VE GOT THREE CATEGORIES OF OPERATORS HERE THAT ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS YOU'VE GOT THEY'RE THE NEFARIOUS OPERATORS THE TERRORIST OR THE CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO CAUSE AN INCIDENT
UP THERE THE PLANE IDIOTIC PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S A GREAT LAUGH TO GO AND FILM A DREAMT ANN AN AIRLINE PILOTS ALL THE PASSENGERS COMING INTO LAND MEN YOU JUST GOT THE PLAIN IGNORANCE SO SO THE GEO FENCE IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH EFFECTIVELY SETS UP A VIRTUAL WALL BY G.P.S. AROUND THESE KEY AREAS CAN BE USEFUL
IT'S NO PANACEA WE'VE GOT HER WE'VE GOT HER ALSO CONSIDER EDUCATION THE GOVERNMENT I THINK THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REALLY NEED TO GET A GRIP OF THIS NOW BUT IS IT A BIT OF SOFTWARE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE TODAY
WELL SOME SOME MODELS OF OF DRAIN SOME SOME COMPANIES ARE NOW MAKING IT STAND THAT AS PART OF THEIR PRODUCT SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE MOST POPULAR HOBBY A STRAIN AT THE MOMENT AN ENTREE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL TRAINED BY AT A CHINESE COMPANY ACTUALLY CALLED CHEAT D.J. I HAVE THIS PRE INSTALLED
SON YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN DRONES AND OTHERS DON'T HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL PETER'S GETTING MESSAGES BUT TELL US YOUR LAST MESSAGE IF YOU WORD WHICH IS YOU THINK THERE'S SOME CHANGE IN THE REGULATION AND MORE NEEDED
I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT CLOSELY I DON'T THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A KNEEJERK REACTION BECAUSE WE'VE GOT ONE OF THE BEST NASCENT INDUSTRY'S PROFESSIONAL DRONE INDUSTRIES IN THE WORLD AND IF WE HAVE A KNEEJERK REACTION THERE JUST BANDS DRONE USE THEN IT'S GOING TO CAUSE US A LOT OF PROBLEMS PETER LEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF THE BIG STATES OF THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS BEING CONTESTED TODAY WITH VOTING IN BOTH THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN NEW YORK IT'S A CHANCE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO TRY AND GET HIS CAMPAIGN BACK ON TRACK AFTER A MAJOR STUMBLE IN WISCONSIN AND FOR HILLARY CLINTON TO TRY AND SHAKE OFF BERNIE SANDERS AFTER LOSING SEVEN OF THE LAST EIGHT CONTESTS ON YOU YOUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT REPORTS
IN A STATE THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE POLITICAL HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON A NINE YEAR OLD SUMMON SUPPORTERS OF HER RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS TO A RALLY IN WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK TURF THAT'S LONG PLAYED HOST TO AN ANGRY DEMONSTRATIONS
THE LAMONT SERVICE ALWAYS ATTRACTS LARGE AND ADORING CROWDS BUT PEOPLE DON'T JUST TURN UP TO SUPPORT HIM THEY ALSO
TO PROTEST THE CAMP WITH US SEE IF HILLARY CLINTON FOR SUMMONS HER SUPPORT OF THE IRAQ WAR AND FOR MANY IT'S THE MEMORIES OF THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY IT'S THIRD WAY POLITICS IT'S CONTROVERSIAL WELFARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS
WHEN HE CAME IN THE OFFICE YOU RISK POSSIBLY GOING TO BE A PROGRESSIVE RIGHT NOW NOT EVEN A CENTRIST HE WENT TO THE RIGHT HE LITERALLY SIDEWARD REPUBLICANS AND WENT FOR THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WELFARE REFORM BILL WHICH MADE
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS AND YOU THINK HILARY WILL BE THERE
HILARY IS SUE AND FURTHER RIGHT IN BELLE SHE'S KOWTOWED TO THE RIGHT SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY AT ANY TIME
BUT IN HIS CARE PARENTS ABOUT WEEK IN HILARY'S CARE TO ABOUT EYE
I'VE COME TO A SMALL TOWN CALLED CHAP A QUIRK IN THE WOODED SUBURBS OF THE NEW YORK COMMUTER BELT
THE CLINTONS BOUGHT A FIVE BEDROOM HOME IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SOMEWHERE FOR THEM TO LIVE
AFTER THEY LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE I'M KEEN TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THEIR NEIGHBOURS
ERNIE ERNIE THE LOCAL TAVERN THERE MADE MENTION OF THE NAME SPARKED A FRIENDLY BUT VIGOROUS DEBATE
DELIGHTFUL WALL STREET HOW MANY
LIKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST RELEASE AGAIN WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE TO RING THE THEFT
WHAT WAS NOTICEABLE BUT IN A LOT WITH THAT SURPRISING WAS THE LACK OF SUPPORT FROM WOMEN ARE PROBLEMAS DOGGED HER CAMPAIGN I THINK THE CHEESE JUST COMPLETE ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS
HAS IT REHEARSED FOR EVERYTHING SHE IS NOT AUTHENTIC SHE'S NOT HER ADVENT ITSELF AND JUST
I MEAN I TAKE HER OVER ANYBODY ELSE BESIDES BERNIE
I'VE COME TO A RIDICULOUSLY TRENDY NIGHTCLUB IN NEW YORK IT'S THE SORT OF PLACE OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN A SCENE
SEX IN THE CITY A COMET IMMEDIATELY AGES ME I SHOULDN'T REALLY BE HERE
HILLARY CLINTON EVENT DESIGNED TO ATTRACT
YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOTES YES TWO POINT FIVE MILLION BORROWED THEN IN AS THOUGH THERE IS THE NEWEST AT THEM REALLY
I THINK THAT YOUNG WOMEN MAY NOT KNOW FOR AN ENTIRE RECORD AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE LISTENING TO LET RAY WING TAPIE LINES ABOUT SHE IS
AND THEY MAYBE MY WAY BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO RESTAURANT THAT DOES IT IT'S AN ACT THAT DOESN'T TURN SEMINARY MADAM THAT'S A GOOD TODAY YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE IS FIGHTING EVERY DAY FOR IT PEOPLE LIKE ME
PASSING INTO THE NIGHT THEY KNEW THAT HILLARY CLINTON SHOULD WIN THIS PRIMARY OR GO ON TO SECURE THE NOMINEE
BUT PAUL SUGGESTS SHE HAS THE HIGHEST UNFAVOURABLE RACING HAVE ANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS THE ONE SILVER LINING
THE NEGATIVES FOR DONALD TRUMP AND TAKE CREWS ARE EVEN HIGHER
THAT WAS NICK BRYANT REPORTED TWENTY FOUR MINUTES AFTER SEVEN ROBERT IN THE SPORT THANKS THANK YOU HELLO AGAIN WELL LESS LEICESTER CITY WE'RE COMING FOR YOU WAS THE CHANT FROM TOTTENHAM FANS AT STOKE LAST NIGHT HERE'S WHAT I CAME TO THE AREA AND IT'S RIGHT
SHAY SCORES STILL TO DEFEND AGAIN ALL OVER THE PLACE LOOK NICE SQUARES
IT'S TAKE IT BACK RIGHT FOOT
MORE POSH CHAIR GIVEN RICHARD CORNELL AND THAT'S HOW IT FINISHED LEAVING TOTTENHAM FIVE POINTS BEHIND PREMIER LEAGUE LEADERS LESTER WITH FOUR GAMES TO PLAY HURRICANES TWO GIRLS TOOK HIM TO TWENTY SEVEN FOR THE SEASON THE COUNTRY'S LEADING SCORER
LESTER OTHER TOUGH DEAD TOOK A COUPLE POINTS AND WE WAS GOING TO FIND OF BUT PRESSURE ON WE THINK WE CAN DO IT
THE IS STILL FIVE POINTS AHEAD BUT THERE'S STILL FOREGO GOES LEFT SO WE CLOSE IT OUT THAT'S ALL WE COULD ATLANTA THAT WAS A TOP PERFORMANCE MIDDLE LESTER'S JAMIE VARNEY COULD MISS MORE THAN THIS WEEKEND'S MATCH AGAINST SWANSEA FOLLOWING HIS DISMISSAL AGAINST WEST HAM TWO DAYS AGO HIS CHARGE FOR IMPROPER CONDUCT FOLLOWING HIS ANGRY PROTEST AT REFEREE JONATHON MOSS COULD CARRY EXTRA PUNISHMENT
HAVE THE EDGING OF I DOUBLE A. OF PRESIDENT LORD COE THAT TRACK AND FIELD EMBRACES INNOVATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN UP BY THE ORGANISERS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WORLD ATHLETICS CHAMPIONSHIPS WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE IN LONDON FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN INTERESTING TICKETING STRATEGY CHILDREN COULD BUY A TICKET FOR NINE POUNDS FIFTY EIGHT
NINE POINT FIVE EIGHT POUNDS IN RECOGNITION OF HIS WORLD RECORD BREAKING TIME FOR THE ONE HUNDRED METRE SET AT THE BERLIN CHAMPIONSHIPS LAST YEAR AND YOU CAN ALSO BUY A SALLY GUNNELL SOMEWHAT MORE EXPENSIVE AT FIFTY TWO POUNDS SEVENTY FOUR THAT REMEMBERS HER TIME AT THE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WORLD CHAMPS FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED METERS HURDLES MORNING SALLY GOOD MORNING WHAT'S THE THINKING BEHIND ITS MARKETING STRATEGY
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY AND GET EVERYBODY ENGAGE IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THE PARALYMPIC ATHLETES CHAMPIONSHIPS NEXT YEAR IN AUGUST WITH ANNOUNCING TODAY'S OR THE TICKET PRICES AND WE'RE JUST SORT OF SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE FAMILY FRIENDLY WE WANT AS MANY PEOPLE TO BE A COMING ALONG AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE PRICES ARE GOOD PRICE FOR PEOPLE TO COME ALONG SO MY TICKET OR FIFTY TO SEVENTY FOUR SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S GOING TO BE
NORMALLY IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT SET ON THAT ONE DAY AN ICE TAKE IT COS MY TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO WHAT SHOULD WE SAY WILL BE PRICED AT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE REALLY SAFER COLIN JACKSON AND JONATHAN WE'VE SORT OF DONE GOLDEN TICKETS FOR REGULAR TO SHOWING A WORLD RECORD IT'S A CERTAINLY EYE CATCHING STRATEGY BUT THE FACT IS OF COURSE IS THAT ATHLETICS NEEDS ALL THE HELP HE CAN GET TO A TRACK SPECTATORS AND THINKING ESPECIALLY FOR EXAMPLE OF THE MOSCOW GAMES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN PLAYED OUT MORE OR LESS IN FRONT OF EMPTY STADIUMS
THAT WAS TRUE BUT I THINK OVER HERE IN GREAT BRITAIN ESPECIALLY AFTER TWENTY TWELVE WE'VE JUST GOT A REAL LONG IN FOR FOR THESE MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS AND WE SAW IT WITH THE RUGBY WE'VE SEEN IT WITH ATHLETICS AT THE ANNIVERSARY GAMES YOU KNOW IT AND THE INDOORS AS WELL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SARAH OUT TOTALLY AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT TWENTY TO I DID IT IT CREATED A REAL HUNGER FOR REALLY TOP CLASS EVENTS SINCE TWENTY TWELVE COURSE ELLIE THERE HAVE BEEN ALL THESE DRUGS WILL PEOPLE REALLY STILL COME TO WATCH ATHLETICS BELIEVING IN WHAT THEY SEE
I REALLY THINK THEY WERE I DO AND I THINK THAT'S JUST SHOWN BY HOW WE FILLED THE STADIUM IN THE LAST YEAR WITH ATHLETICS EVENTS AS WELL AND I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF CHANGES GOING ON AROUND THE DRUGS AROUND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THE IDABELLE YES AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT AS A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD AND IT'S NOT JUST A SPORT IT'S ALL HIS OTHER SPORTS AS WELL
I THINK IF WE ARE CLEARING UP THE SPORT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO BE THE MUCH MORE POSITIVE ABOUT IT COS WE'VE GOT SOME FANTASTIC STARS AND WE REALLY NEED TO SUPPORT THEM AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING EVENT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESENTATION OF ATHLETICS ITSELF IT'S ROOTED IN TRADITION AFTER ALL THE PINS ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD AREN'T THEY DOES IT NEED MORE RAZZMATAZZ
I THINK IT DOES AND I THINK I THINK SO YEAH I THINK IT DOES IN SOME WAYS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY ON THE INDOORS WHERE YOU KNOW THIS THAT'S MORE LIGHTS AND DRAMA GOING ON AND I THINK YOU KNOW FOR AN EVENT THAT'S WHAT THE CROWD TO ONE YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GETTING CROWDS IN THERE A REAL ATHLETICS LOVERS THERE FOR THEIR FAMILIES THAT JUST WANT TO TAKE THERE
KIDS ALONG COS THEY CAN COME TO EVENTS AND AFFORD IT LIKE THIS SO IT NEEDS TO ENGAGE EVERYBODY ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY NEEDED AS WELL OH KAY A FINAL THOUGHT WHAT ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE EVENTS THEMSELVES I CAN'T SEE HOW THE FOUR HUNDRED HURDLES HIM ENDED BUT BUT I THINK LORD COE HAS SOME IDEAS IN THAT TOO I THINK HE'S LOOKING AT THE LONG JUMP EITHER THAT THE FINAL FEW JUMPS IT THAT THERE'S LESS PEOPLE COMING IN
BUT I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW HE'S STILL GOT TO STICK BY THE REAL ROSE AND IT HAS TO BE FAIR FOR EVERYBODY SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE ENORMOUSLY I THINK IT'LL BE MUCH MORE AROUND THE DRAMA AROUND THE EVENTS IN AND OUT OF IT THAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT SELLING THANKS VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING TO THE RACING TIPS THEN LUDLOW THREE TEN NUMBER THREE EXPRESS TO BELLY WOLVERHAMPTON TO TWENTY NUMBER ONE ARGENT NIGHT

THANK YOU NEIL IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE ROLE OF THE E. USED NAVAL MISSION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IS TO BE EXPANDING EXPANDED THIS FOLLOWS WARNINGS FROM ITALY THE MORE MIGRANTS ARE HEADING THEIR WAY NOW THAT THE E. USE DEAL WITH TURKEY HAS MADE THAT CROSSING TO GREECE MORE COMPLICATED AND A MEETING OF E.U. FOREIGN AND DEFENCE MINISTERS YESTERDAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MISSION EXPANSION COULD INCLUDE TRAINING THE LIBYAN COAST GUARD TO STOP
THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS ARE EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ADLER JOINS US FROM SICILY THIS MORNING MORNING CATCHER
GOOD MORNING NICK BON JORDAN OR FROM THE MISTY BUT STILL SPARKLING SICILIAN COAST WHERE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS ALONE THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS HAVE ARRIVED AFTER SETTING OFF IN PEOPLE SMUGGLERS DENISE ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM LIBYA AND ALSO FROM EGYPT HAVE YE THE E. YOU REALLY IS UNDER HUGE PRESSURE TO COME UP NOT JUST WITH PROMISES BUT EFFECTIVE SOLUTION IS AHEAD OF ANOTHER FRANTIC SUMMER OF MIGRANT CROSSINGS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT FACES THE CONUNDRUM OF WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THESE NEW ARRIVALS
BUT ALSO BECAUSE BRUSSELS IS AWARE THAT THE MIGRANT CRISIS IS ERODING ITS CREDIBILITY AND RISKS INCREASING EURO SCEPTICISM ACROSS THE CONTINENT NOT LEAST IN BRITAIN OF COURSE AHEAD OF THE REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP BUT ALSO HERE IN ITALY TRADITIONALLY A EUROPHILE NATION BUT IT'S FRONTLINE POSITION OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS IS SQUEEZING IT ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY AND FOR MANY HERE THE FINGER OF BLAME POINTS DIRECTLY AT BRUSSELS
A MISTAKE A BHILIDH ITALY AS WE BELIEVE IT TO BE
IRRESISTIBLE TAPESTRY OF VIBRANT PIAZZAS AND CAFES ORNATE CHURCHES AND BUZZING MOPEDS
HELLO I'M WE'VE GOT IN THE YES
THIS CREASING IS ITALY I'M IN ROME'S PIAZZA VITTORIO TRANSFORMED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS INTO A SCENE MORE REMINISCENT OF LONDON
WITH CHINESE INDIAN AND KOREAN EATERIES AND A CORNER SHOP CALLING ITSELF THE ISLAM GROCERY
MULTICULTURAL ITALY IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON BUT IT'S A GROWING ONE
SALMON CONQUERING ITALIAN HARTSON PALLETS IS EASIER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK THE SYRIAN OWNER OF ROME'S SHOW WHILE THE STATION TURF PHILBY'S THICK ACROSS THERE
ACCORDING TO MY DENOTES WHINY ITALIANS LIKE SYRIANS SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME EATING OR TALKING ABOUT GOOD FOOD AND BOTH PEOPLES LIVES REVOLVE AROUND THEIR MUM AS YOU
SO AT THIS COEXISTENCE COSY SPENCER AS IT'S KNOWN HERE IS DELICATE AND HARD ONE I WANT TO GET IT WHEN YOUR MUM SONNY SALIM ORIGINALLY FROM EGYPT FOUNDED THIS MOSQUE TWENTY YEARS AGO IN A GRAFFITI COVERED WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF ROME
HE TOLD ME ITALIAN NEIGHBOURS WOULD HELP THE CONGREGATION WITH TOMATOES CIGARETTE BUTT AND DIRTY WATER MUST ME MUM BUT SHE SAID SHE HANKY EIGHT BUT ALREADY ZI BUT WHERE'S THE IGNORANCE IS THE BREEDER OF HATE I WAS DETERMINED TO OPEN OUR DOORS AND SHOW THAT MUSLIMS ARE JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE AND ONE OF THE REASONS ITALY HAS FAR FEWER ISLAMIST RADICALS THAN MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
IS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GHETTOS IN ITALY NO ISOLATED MUSLIM NEIGHBOURHOODS WE ALL LIVE MIXED IN AMONG EACH OTHER HERE THAT'S BREEDS TOLERANCE
BUT WILL YOU TELL YOUNG BUT ITALIAN TOLERANCE IS NOW THINNING FOLLOWING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS COUPLED WITH ITALIAN FEARS OVER THE LARGE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING BY DINGING FROM NORTH AFRICA
IT IS A BIT DULL YES BET THAT DO YOU NO
A RECENT DEBATE BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT ON THE FUTURE OF THE E.U. AND ITALY'S ROLE IN IT WAS HIJACKED BY A ROW OVER MIGRATION
CALA PARADIGM IS ITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER OF COURSE WE'RE WORRIED FROM ARE YOU MANAGE HER OWN POINT OF VIEW FROM THE SECURITY POINT OF VIEW AND THEN OF COURSE FROM FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW HE CANNOT AVOID MENTIONING THAT GIVEN MY JOB
THE MIGRATION HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL WE WEAR FOR A LONG TIME JUST LEFT ALONE

THE EXPRESS SAYS THE CHANCELLOR SUMS ADD UP TO GOBBLEDEGOOK AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A POSITIVE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. THE REMAIN IS CRANKING UP THE SCARE TACTICS BUT THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE REPORT IS NOT SCAREMONGERING BUT A REALITY CHECK IN THE REAL DANGERS OF LEAVING THE E.U. SHOULD BE VOICED LOUDLY REPEATEDLY AND WITHOUT APOLOGY

HE ARGUES THE PRESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT IN HIS COUNTRY'S INTERESTS HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE BIGGEST THREAT TO BRITAIN IS THE WESTERN WORLD FALLING IN ON ITSELF SPLINTERED AND DIVIDED THE FACT HE WRITES THAT THE VOTE TO LEAVE WILL BE SUCH BAD NEWS FOR OUR CLOSEST ALLIES SHOULD BE A MATERIAL FACTOR IN DECIDING HOW WE VOTE

THE TITLE OF THE BOOK WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN GOOD BIKINIS BARELY HINTS AT THE GRIEF WHICH THE BOOK CONTAINS IT'S THE STORY OF THE AUTHOR HELEN BAILEY WHO'S BEEN MISSING NOW FOR MORE THAN A WEEK RAISING CONCERNS OF COURSE NOT JUST AMONGST HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT THE POLICE AS WELL THE BOOK BEGINS WITH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS ON A BREAK WITH HER HUSBAND JOHN
ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WHILST ON HOLIDAY IN BARBADOS MY HUSBAND GOT OFF SUN LOUNGER ADJUSTED HIS GLASSES AND HEADED INTO THE SEA FOR A SWIM
MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIM CALL FOR HELP AND WATCHED HELPLESSLY FROM THE BEACH AS HE WAS PULLED OUT TO SEA BY A RIPTIDE
HE DROWNED
BIZARRELY AFTER HE DIED ALMOST THE FIRST THING I SAID WAS THAT I'M WEARING A BIKINI
AS IF BAD THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE WEARING A GOOD BIKINI BUT THEY CAN AND IT DID
AT THE AGE OF FORTY SIX I CRASH LANDED ON PLANET GRIEF A PLACE WHERE NOTHING NOT EVEN MY OWN REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR FELT FAMILIAR
LISTENING TO THAT WITH US IN THE STUDIO A FRIEND OF HELEN'S NOT CHESTER FROM BUT HER BEREAVEMENT COUNSELLOR AS WELL SHELLEY J. WHITE WHITEHEAD YOU JUST GET A GLIMPSE OF THE ANGUISH THE DEEP DEEP ANGUISH THAT HELEN'S OBVIOUSLY FEELING DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL THAT THERE IS SHE STILL THERE AND YOU NEED TO GET A MESSAGE TO HER
SHE'S CERTAINLY NOT HIM A BEREAVEMENT FAYE'S GOING BACK TO THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND BUT GETTING A MESSAGE OUT THAT TO HELEN IS TOO PLEASE IF SHE IS LISTENING TO THIS IF SHE DOES
YEAH ANYTHING TO GET IN CONTACT WITH OTHERS WHO CARE ABOUT HER BECAUSE REALLY EXTREMELY EXTREMELY WORRIED IT'S TOTALLY OUT OF CHARACTER AND YET THAT THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT SHE'D WRITTEN MESSAGES ON FACEBOOK SAYING SHE NEEDED SOME TIME TO HERSELF EVERYBODY NEEDS TIME FOR THEMSELVES BUT NOT EVERYBODY GOES MISSING
SHE'S CHOSEN TO WRITE ABOUT GRIEF SHE CHOSE TO CHAIR SHARE HER SENSE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE BEREAVED CLEARLY MAY BE HELPFUL TO OTHERS WAS IT HELPFUL TO HER IT WAS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO HER BECAUSE PART OF WHAT HILL AND CHERISHES IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE
AND IN SUCH APPOINTMENT AUTHENTIC I CAN'T I'VE HEARD LOSS I'M INCREDIBLY FUNNY AT TIMES AS WELL BECAUSE SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL WAY OF WRITING EXPRESSING HERSELF AS ACID SO AUTHENTICALLY
AND SHE HAS HELPED SO MANY WIDOWS AND WIDOWERS IN A SENSE THAT CHOOSING TO WRITE THE BOOK ABOUT THE FACT SHE WAS WRITING A BIKINI AT THE TIME ALMOST CAPTURING IF YOU LIKE THE BANALITY OF A TRAGIC MOMENT LIKE THAT IN THE BANALITY SOMETIMES OF THE RESPONSE THAT YOU WISH YOU THOUGHT SOMETHING DEEPER MORE PROFOUND THAN YOU DID AT THE TIME
IT'S IT WAS SUCH A AS I SIT POINTING TO COME TO END AND DEVASTATING AND SHE REALLY EXPRESS THAT SO BEAUTIFULLY
HOWEVER SHE MOVED THROUGH THEIR STAGES OF GRIEF AMAZINGLY WELL AND VERY NORMALLY FOR SOMEONE WHO PULLED OUT ALL THE SUPPORT SHE POSSIBLY COULD TO GET THROUGH EACH AND EVERY DAY SHE REFERRED TO PLANET GRIEF IN THEIR EXTRACT AND HAD A BLOKE BY THE SAME NAME BUT YOU'RE SAYING AS A FRIEND
SHOULD BE ON THAT FACE JEN OTHERWISE PEOPLE WHO FRANKLY ASSUME SHE'S GONE MISSING BECAUSE SHE CAN'T GET OVER THIS LOSS HILL IN THE WRONG YEAH THEY ENTIRELY WRONG HELEN WAS WELL OVER THERE PLUS AND I REALLY I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT HELEN BEING HER BEREAVEMENT CATCH FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HER WHOLE PRECIS
SHE HAD MOVED FORWARD WITH HER LIFE AND WAS REALLY LIVING A LIFE THAT SHE LOVED AND SHE WAS FUNNY FOR PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THE LESSONS FOR THEM YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS A BEREAVEMENT CAGER ACCOUNTS FOR I SUPPOSE PEOPLE MIGHT CORY WHAT'S THE VALUE OF TALKING AS IT WOULD TO A THIRD PARTY RATHER THAN FRIENDS
A THIRD PARTY'S VERY OBJECTIVE AND GETS TO HEAR SEE AND UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT YOU PERHAPS ARE NOT AWARE OF AND BY DRAWING AWARENESS TO WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THESE MORE CLARITY AND WITH CLARITY THEY CAN BE A DIFFERENT VISION OR A REFRAME THE MOST COMFORTING THING IS TO KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
AND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE O.K. SHELLEY WHITER THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CHIEF RABBI NERVOUS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
DEEPLY MOVING STORY CAUGHT MY EYE YESTERDAY LUNCH HOFFMAN HAS BEEN RAISING AWARENESS IN THE NATIONAL MEDIA ABOUT PARKINSON'S DISEASE DIAGNOSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX HE EXPLAINS THAT ONE OF THE HARDEST SOMETIMES TO COME TO TERMS WITH IS THE DIFFICULTY HE NOW HAS INTERACTING WITH OTHERS AND PARTICULARLY HIS FAMILY
SUDDENLY HE CAN'T SMILE AT HIS GRANDDAUGHTERS OR STICK HIS TONGUE OUT AT THEM TO MAKE THEM GIGGLE INDEED PENNY KIND OF SPEECH HAS BECOME A REAL CHALLENGE
BUT HIS DAUGHTER'S WEDDING THE SUMMER HAS FOCUSED HIS MIND HE WAS DETERMINED TO GIVE HIS FATHER OF THE BRIDE SPEECH AND NOTHING WILL STAND IN HIS WAY SUCH AS THE POWER OF HIS LOVE FOR HIS FAMILY
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME JEWISH FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE SITTING DOWN TO THE PASSOVER FEAST KNOWN AS THE SADR
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SADR WE DID VEGETABLES AND SALT WATER IT IS A CUSTOM KNOWN AS CAR PASS WHICH HAS A FASCINATING ORIGEN CAR PLUS WAS A MATERIAL USED BY THE BIBLICAL JACOB TO MAKE THE SPECIAL COAT HE GAVE TO HIS FAVOURITE CHILD JOSEPH
I'LL CUSTOM RECALLS HOW JOSEPH'S BROTHERS AFTER SELLING HIM INTO SLAVERY DIPPED HIS COAT INTO THE BLOOD OF A GOAT RETURNING HOME THEY DECLARED TO THEIR FATHER JOSEPH HE'S GONE WILD ANIMAL HAS DEVOURED HIM
DURING THE SADR WE TELL THE STORY OF HOW WE LEFT EGYPT THE DIPPING REMINDS US HOW WE GOT INTO EGYPT IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WAS THE RESULT OF A BITTER FEUD A FAMILY WAS DIVIDED BY TRAGIC ENMITY AND FRICTION AND IT ALTERED THE COURSE OF HISTORY IT IS A POWERFUL AND UNIVERSAL WARNING
THE FRAGILITY OF THE MODERN FAMILY HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF OUR SOCIETY FAMILIES BRING TOGETHER A VARIETY OF CHARACTERS AND PERSONALITIES WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS PRIORITIES AND ASPIRATIONS YET THEY WORK TOGETHER AS A UNIT
THAT'S A PASSOVER TIME WE CELEBRATE FAMILY BY MAKING A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNITY AND UNIFORMITY
WHERE IS UNIFORMITY HAS ACHIEVED FOR EXAMPLE BY STANDARDISED ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS GROWN IN THE GROUND TO GO NEED TO COLOUR AND SIZE UNITY IS ACHIEVED WHEN THE FLOWERS I GATHER TOGETHER AND DIFFERENCES OF FORM COLOUR AND FRAGRANCE ENHANCE THE BEAUTY OF THE COLLECTIVE BUNCH BOUND BY ONE SINGLE CALLED
A PASSOVER CELEBRATION OF THE UNITY OF THE FAMILY PROVIDES A TEMPLATE WITH ENOUGH FRACTURED CIVILISATION FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN TREASURING UNION AND CELEBRATING DIVERSITY
TO SOFTEN AND FAMILY WOULD NO DOUBT APPRECIATE THIS ANCIENT AFRICAN PROVERB WHICH I LOVE IF YOU WANT TO GO QUICKLY GO ALONE IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO TOGETHER
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CHIEF RABBI MYRRH THIS TIME THERE WAS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT A SCHOOL A CONCERT HALL A PARK FULL OF CHILDREN A CAFE THE METRO OR LOCATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SOFT TARGETS ARE BY THEIR VERY NATURE EASY TO STRIKE AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE PEOPLE FEARFUL ABOUT THE RISKS THEY MAY BE TAKING IN THEIR DAILY LIVES
IN SIX WEEKS' TIME FRANCE WILL HOST THE UREA SIXTEEN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IT'S ON A HIGH STATE OF ALERT IN THE WAKE OF THE PARIS ATTACKS WE'RE JOINED BY SYBIL BROADHURST WAS THE METROPOLITAN POLICE'S GOLD COMMANDER FOR THE LONDON OLYMPICS AND WHO'LL BE SPEAKING AT A MAJOR COUNTER TERRORISM CONFERENCE THAT BEGINS IN LONDON TODAY GOOD MORNING MORNING ARE WE IN AN AGE DO YOU THINK WHERE SOFT TARGETS ARE MORE OF A FOCUS FOR TERRORISTS
I THINK SADLY WE PROBABLY ARE ALTHOUGH I THINK IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE SOFT TARGET HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE
YOU HARDEN THE TARGETS YOU HARDEN THE STADIA YOU HARDEN THE AIRPORTS BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO CONGREGATE THEY JUST SEEM SADLY NOW UNDER THE SOFT TARGET IS MORE IN FASHION AND WOOD AND JUST VISITIN EVERT INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT AS YOU TIGHTEN UP SECURITY AT MORE HIGH PROFILE PLACES GETTING ON PLANES FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT UNFORTUNATELY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE IF YOU LIKE TO CALL IT THAT A SOFTER TARGET THIS SIDE NO THE
THE PUBLIC SIDE OF THE AIRPORT IT'S GOT TO BE WHERE PEOPLE CONGREGATE IF YOU MOVE THE SEARCH REGIME BACK TO THE DOORS OF THE AIRPORT YOU HAVE A SOFT TARGET YOU HAVE A CROWD OF PEOPLE IT'S HOW YOU MITIGATE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE KEY HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT POLICING THE EUROS SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT IN THAT CASE YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING HAD THAT ROLL OVER TWENTY TWELVE AND AS FAR AS FRANCE IS CONCERNED
IT IT HAD THE PARIS ATTACKS THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD CRITICISM OF ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF AND ALL OF THE BELGIAN INTELLIGENCE OTHERS PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE BRUSSELS ATTACKED SO WHAT HELP HELP HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT THE EUROS
IT'S A DIFFICULT BALANCE BETWEEN SECURITY AND PUBLIC ENJOYMENT IN FACT FOR THE OLYMPICS WE HAD A MANTRA IT WAS A SPORTING EVENT WITH SECURITY OVERLAY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND IT WILL BE QUITE EASY FOR THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES TO REALLY MAKE PARIS AND ALL THE OTHER MAJOR CITIES
SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR FOR ANYBODY TERRORIST OR OTHERWISE IT IT TAKES THE TOTAL ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT FOR THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS AND THOSE OTHERS ARE TO COME TO ENJOY THE SPORT IN THE CITIES THE KEY IS THE ACTIVITY THAT WILL BE GOING ON AT THE MOMENT THERE WILL BE WORK GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND NOT JUST BY THE FRENCH POLICE AND THE FRENCH SECURITY AUTHORITIES BUT BY ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED AND INDEED AROUND THE WORLD THE KEY FOR THE MOMENT IS
TO MAKE FRANCE A REALLY HARD PLACE FOR ANY TERRORIST OR ANY CRIMINAL COME TO THAT MATTER TO WANT TO OPERATE DURING THE EUROPE THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE THE DEFICIENCIES HAVEN'T WE IAN IN INTELLIGENCE SHARING ACROSS BORDERS BETWEEN FRANCE AND BELGIUM THERE WAS CRITICISM OF EUROPE RECENTLY FROM SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE THE FORMER HEAD OF M. I. SIX WHO SAID THAT THERE WAS A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE LEVELS OF PROFESSIONALISM IN INTELLIGENCE AND THOSE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THAT CERTAINLY IN RELATION TO BELGIUM LESS SO IN RELATION TO FRANCE BUT WHAT THAT WILL HAVE DONE ONE OF ACTORS ARE AN EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE THE TIMELY REMINDER THAT INTELLIGENCE IS KEY AND THAT ACTING ON THAT INTELLIGENCE IS ALSO PARAMOUNT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE OLYMPICS IN TWENTY TWELVE WAS OUR POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD IN THE RUN UP TO THE GAMES
TO ACT ON THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WE HAD TO BE BREAKING THE ARREST TO BE DISRUPTING POTENTIAL TERRORIST CELLS TO MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OPERATE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING TO GO TO THE EUROS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIABLY WORRIED ABOUT SAFETY AND SECURITY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHAT WOULD YOU URGE THEM TO DO
OBVIOUSLY BE VIGILANT BUT BUT HIS AWARENESS OF THE RISKS ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AWARENESS AMONGST THE PUBLIC I MEAN I THINK ABSOLUTELY IT DOES AND SOME JUST COMMONSENSE ACTIVITIES LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH HARDER NOW TO GET INTO THE STADIUM SO GET THERE EARLY
DON'T TAKE UNNECESSARY BAGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ALERT ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE DOING AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO MENTION IT TO A POLICE OFFICER OR A STEWARD OR A SECURITY GUARD IT IS GENERAL AWARENESS IF WE ALL ARRIVE LATE FOR THE STADIA AND THEN START TO GET AGITATED BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO SEA KICK OFF
THAT THEN JUST EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM AS TO THE PUBLIC ORDER ISSUES BUT MAKES THE SECURITY OPERATION THAT MUCH MORE CHALLENGING BUT IF THE PUBLIC IS MORE FEARFUL AND MORE AWARE OF THOSE SORT OF RISKS ARE WHAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY END UP ANY SAFER DO WE THE THREAT IS THE THREAT
THE THROAT IS A THREAT BUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS THE ACTIVITY THAT WILL BE GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND AND SEE INTO THE PUBLIC SHOULDN'T REALLY SURE ALL OF US BUT THESE EVENTS ON MUCH SAFER THAN DAILY LIFE IN MANY WAYS
SO BOB BROADHURST THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THE WEATHER TOM CHEF BACK HERE AND NICK THANK YOU LOVELY MORNING ACROSS A LARGE CHUNK OF THE U.K. NOT NECESSARILY IN SOME SOUTHERN AREAS IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT CLOUDY OVERNIGHT BUT
BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S ALSO BEEN QUITE MILD TEN DEGREES IN LONDON BUT WE HAVE HAD THE SUNSHINE TOUCH OF GRASS FROST THIS MORNING AND I THINK ON BALANCE FOR MANY OF US IT'S A FINE DAY TODAY SO STARTING IN SCOTLAND WE'VE GOT SOME SUNNY SPELLS COMING THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES SHOULD GET UP TO AROUND TWELVE DEGREES IN GLASGOW AND EDINBURGH BELFAST SHOULD ALSO HAVE SOME SUNNY SPELLS AT TIMES IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CLOUDY IN BELFAST BUT ON BALANCE NOT A BAD DAY ALSO TWELVE DEGREES HERE
FOR WALES IT'S THE SOUTH THAT MAY HANG ONTO THE CLOUD FROM TIME TO TIME BUT AGAIN A DRY DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT TWELVE THIRTEEN DEGREES ANIMAL MUST PLACE TODAY WILL BE IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND SIXTEEN CELSIUS IN LONDON BUT FOR MOST OF US ACROSS ENGLAND IT WILL BE WITH IN THE REGION OF AROUND ABOUT SAY ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN AND SOME SUNSHINE ON THE WAY TO
CLEAR EVENING TONIGHT THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A CHILLY NIGHT AND THE CHILLY MORNING TOMORROW'S WHO'LL BE WAKING UP TO TEMPERATURES OF AROUND ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES WILL BE COLDER THAN THAT EVEN EARLIER OF COURSE TOUCH OF FROST AS WELL

EAMONN DEVIL ERA GOES OVER TO LONDON TO MEET LLOYD GEORGE AND IT'S JUST THE TWO OF THEM THE ANGLO IRISH AGREEMENT OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE AND LLOYD GEORGE DESCRIBE TRYING TO TALK TO DEVIL THERE AS BEING LIKE TRYING TO PICK UP MERCURY WITH A FORK THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT
HISTORY THAT FOLLOWED ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE QUOTES CAME FROM MICHAEL

RESEARCHERS BELIEVE DINOSAURS WERE HEADING FOR EXTINCTION MILLIONS OF YEARS BEFORE AN ASTEROID DELIVERED THE KILLER BLOW THAT WIPES THEM OUT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SUITE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOES OVER THE CABINET'S LEADING CAMPAIGNER FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ACCUSING THE VOTE REMAINED SIDE OF PATRONISING VOTERS WITH THEIR ARGUMENTS
YOU'LL SAY IN HIS SPEECH THIS MORNING THAT THEY'RE TREATING PEOPLE LIKE ME ARE CHILDREN CAPABLE OF BEING FRIGHTENED INTO OBEDIENCE IS INTERVENTION COMES A DAY AFTER THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE PUBLISHED A TREASURY ANALYSIS SHOWING THE ECONOMY COULD BE SIX PERCENT SMALLER THAN FORECAST BY TWENTY THIRTY IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THEIR FEROCITY AND BREADTH OF MY GOES ATTACK ON THE GOVERNMENT TODAY REFLECTS HOW FAR THIS E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS FUELLING WHAT'S BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY DIVISIVE AND ACRIMONIOUS CONFLICT WITHIN THE TORY PARTY THE JUSTICE SECRETARY IN A RIPOSTE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S WARNING YESTERDAY ABOUT THE RISKS TO THE ECONOMY WHEN ARGUE THE REAL RISK IS REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND DECISION HE SAYS WILL GIVE THE Y. YOU CAN'T
BLANCHE TO TAKE MORE POWER AND MONEY FROM BRITAIN HE'LL ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR OF WANTING PEOPLE TO BELIEVE BRITAIN IS BEATEN AND BROKEN AND HE WILL HIGHLIGHT WHAT HE CALLS THEIR OFFICIAL ADMISSION IN MISTER OSBORNE'S TREASURY REPORT THAT IMMIGRATION IS SET TO KEEP INCREASING BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
EVERY YEAR DESPITE GOVERNMENT PROMISES HE'LL ALSO WARN MINISTERS RISKS SEEDING CONTROL TO THE E.U. OVER THE SECURITY SERVICES ASYLUM LAW AND PENAL POLICY IT'S UNDERSTOOD WHILE MISTER GOW WILL SET OUT A PICTURE OF WHAT
BRITAIN WOULD BE LIKE OUTSIDE DO YOU THERE ARE NO PLANS THOUGH BY THE LEAST SIDE TO PUBLISH THEIR OWN DOCUMENT LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SUCH A REPORT BUT ALSO CAUTIOUS ABOUT SETTING OUT DETAILED PLANS WHICH COULD THEN BE ATTACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HOWEVER HAVE ACCUSED MY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FOCUS ON PROCESS BECAUSE HE CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT BRITAIN MIGHT LOOK LIKE OUTSIDE THE E.U.
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN SHAPING POLICIES ON AIR AND WATER POLLUTION AND PROTECTING WILDLIFE A REPORT BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT COMMITTEE SAYS E.U. LAWS HAVE PLAYED A KEY PART IN IMPROVING STANDARDS BUT NOT ALL THE M.P.S ON THE COMMITTEE AGREED WITH ITS CONCLUSIONS MORE DETAILS FROM HELEN BRIGGS
MUCH OF BRITAIN'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ORIGINATES FROM THE E.U. THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT COMMITTEE SAYS THIS MEANS WE BATHE ON CLEANER BEACHES AND DRIVE MORE FUEL EFFICIENT CARS THE LABOUR M. P. MARY CRAY WHO CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S LARGELY THANKS TO SUCH LAWS THAT THE U.K. HAS CLEANED UP ITS ACT SINCE BEING DUBBED THE DIRTY MAN OF EUROPE IN THE SEVENTIES
A MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE'S MEMBERS WANT BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BUT THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. PETER LILLEY WHO FAVOURS BRITAIN LEAVING REFUSED TO SIGN THE REPORT HE ACCUSED SOME ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHO GAVE EVIDENCE OF HAVING A VESTED INTEREST BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE THE E.U. FUNDING
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S WILL TODAY LAUNCHED THE FIRST PARLIAMENTARY INVESTIGATION INTO THE SCALE AND IMPACT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH COMMISSIONED BY THE WOMEN AND DE QUALITIES COMMITTEE SUGGESTS THAT PUPILS ARE OFTEN BULLIED INTO SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND THAT MANY ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED MAGGIE MORGAN FROM THE CHARITY FIXES WHICH CARRIED OUT THE RESEARCH TOLD US SHE WAS SURPRISED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH TEENAGER'S BEHAVIOUR IS SEXUALISED
SEXTING THE SHARING OF SEXUALISED IMAGES IS VERY MUCH CONSIDERED A NORM IN ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO YOUNG PEOPLE NOW THERE'S AN INEVITABILITY TO IT THEY APPRECIATE THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THIS THEY JUST MUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T DO IT TOO EARLY AND THAT THEY MUST BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IF THE PICTURES GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS IT COULD CAUSE THEM ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS
OFFICIALS IN AFGHANISTAN SAY MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED IN A SUICIDE ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL KABUL THE NUMBER OF DEAD IS STILL UNCLEAR BUT PRESIDENT ASHRAF AFGHANI SAID SEVERAL PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED REPORTS SUGGEST THREE ARMED MEN ENTERED A GOVERNMENT BUILDING USED BY THE COUNTRY'S SPECIAL PROTECTION UNIT THE FORCE THAT GUARDS ITS MOST SENIOR POLITICIANS THE TALIBAN SAID THEY WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK
THE FIRST FUNERALS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ECUADOR FOR THE VICTIMS OF SATURDAY'S EARTHQUAKE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED THIRTEEN PEOPLE ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED WITH MANY MORE INJURED RESCUE TEAMS SEARCHING THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF COLLAPSED BUILDINGS HAVE PULLED OUT A NUMBER OF SURVIVORS INCLUDING A BABY A CORRESPONDENT KATIE WATSON REPORTS FROM THE CAPITAL QUITO
RESCUE WORKERS LOADED LORRIES WITH DRINKING WATER FOOD AND CLOTHES FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVED PICK UP TRUCKS TRANSPORTED THE FIRST COFFINS AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T THE SECOND FULL DAY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE THE RESCUE EFFORT IS IN FULL SWING BUT RESOURCES HERE ARE STRETCHED AUTHORITIES ARE RELYING ON INTERNATIONAL HELP TO FIND PEOPLE STILL TRAPPED UNDER THE RUBBLE
NOT ALL AREAS THAT WERE HIT HAVE RECEIVED THE HELP THEY NEED AND SOME COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING DESPERATE THERE'S STILL NO CLEAR IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING AND IN TOWNS LIKE BUT THEY'VE NOW LIZ WHICH RESCUERS SAY HAS BEEN EIGHTY PER CENT FLATTENED DECOMPOSING BODIES ARE NOW BECOMING A HEALTH RISK
DOCTORS SAY THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA WHO WERE TREATED WITH A COMBINATION OF TWO IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUGS IN A TRIAL SURVIVED FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS THE STUDY OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FORTY PATIENTS ALSO FOUND THAT A FIFTH OF THEM HAD NO MORE SIGNS OF TUMOURS AFTER RECEIVING THE DRUGS AND MY VOL A MAP A HEALTH REPORTER JAMES GALLAGHER HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT THEIR FINDINGS
A PILLAR MOVE VOLLMER ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE AS TREATMENTS FOR MELANOMA ON THE N.H.S. BUT MOST RESEARCHERS BELIEVE COMBINATION THERAPY WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GIVE PATIENTS THE BEST CHANCE OF SURVIVAL DATA FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO PATIENTS GIVEN BOTH DRUGS SHOWED SIXTY NINE PER CENT WAS STILL ALIVE AFTER TWO YEARS AND TWENTY TWO PER CENT HAD NO SIGN OF TUMOURS IN THEIR BODY THE POTENTIAL OF THESE DRUGS HAS BEEN REPORTED WIDELY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT PROMISE HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO SURVIVAL FIGURES
CANCER RESEARCH U.K. SAID THE STEADY GAVE NEW HOPE TO PATIENTS BUT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT HALF OF PEOPLE IN THE TRIAL HAD SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HAS HELD TALKS WITH PRESIDENT MUGABE DURING AN UNSCHEDULED VISIT TO ZIMBABWE JUSTIN WELBY TRAVELLED ACROSS THE BORDER FROM ZAMBIA WHERE HE'S BEEN ATTENDING A MEETING OF ANGLICAN LEADERS AS COLOUR MAY REPORTS THE TWO MEN HAD A DIFFERENCE OF VIEW OVER MY MUGABE'S STRONG OPPOSITION TO SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS
THE ARCHBISHOP SAID MY MUGABE RAISED THE QUESTION OF SAME SEX MARRIAGE AT THE MEETING IN HARARE WHICH LAMBETH PALACE SAID WAS ORGANISED AT THE LAST MINUTE AND TOOK LESS THAN AN HOUR THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE ANSWER HE GAVE TO MY MUGABE WAS THAT THERE WERE WIDELY DIFFERING VIEWS AMONG ANGLICANS BUT MOST BELIEVE MARRIAGE TO BEAT THEIR LIFELONG UNION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN BUT HE CALLED THE CRIMINALISATION OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUALITY ENTIRELY WRONG
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE ARCHBISHOP BUT MY MUGABE ENTIRELY AGREED WITH ME JUSTIN WELBY IS THE FIRST ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TO VISIT MY MUGABE WHO'S CATHOLIC SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN AT A TIME OF TENSION BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND STATE IN ZIMBABWE THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE SITUATION HAD SINCE GREATLY IMPROVED
THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL HAS CALLED A GENERAL ELECTION FOR THE SECOND OF JULY UP TO SIX MONTHS EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED LAST MONTH HE INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EARLY ELECTION UNLESS THE SENATE AGREED TO PASS THE GOVERNMENTS LABOUR REFORM BILL WHICH IT REJECTED FOR A SECOND TIME YESTERDAY
THE STUDY HAS SUGGESTED THE DINOSAURS WERE DYING OUT FIFTY MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE ASTEROID IMPACT THAT'S BEEN BLAMED FOR WIPING THEM OUT THE NEW ASSESSMENT FROM RESEARCHERS AT READING AND BRISTOL UNIVERSITY'S CHALLENGES THEIR VIEW THAT THEY WERE THRIVING RIGHT UP UNTIL THE ASTEROID HIT HERE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT HOWEVER GAUCHE
DINOSAUR WAS ONCE DOMINATED THE PLANET BUT SIXTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO AN ASTEROID HIT THE EARTH AND WIPED THEM OUT WERE IT NOT FOR THAT CATACLYSMIC EVENT WOULD THEY STILL BE AROUND TODAY PROBABLY NOT ACCORDING TO HER NEW ANALYSIS OF DINOSAUR FOSSILS
IT SHOWS THAT SPECIES WERE DECLINING FOR THE FIFTY MILLION YEARS LEADING UP TO THE ASTEROID IMPACT THE LOSS OF SPECIES WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE DINOSAURS COULD NOT COPE WITH THE WAY THE EARTH WAS CHANGING ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR PAUL BARRETT AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN LONDON
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD PRIOR TO THE ASTEROIDS HITTING INCLUDING CHANGES IN SEA LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF LAND AREA CHANGED IN THE PLANTS ARE LIVING ON THE LAND SO LOTS OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AFFECTING THE SUCCESS OF DINOSAURS
THE NEW STUDY INDICATES THAT EARLY MAMMALS WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND EVEN WITHOUT THE EARTH'S CHANCE COLLISION WITH AN ASTEROID MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
THE AMERICAN ACTRESS DORIS ROBERTS BEST KNOWN FOR HER ROLE IN THE SITCOM EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY SHE WON FOUR OF HER FIVE EMMY AWARDS AS THE MOTHER OF THE LEAD CHARACTER PLAYED BY RAY REMAND HE SAID HE WAS AMAZED BY HER ENERGY AND SPIRIT

THIS MORNING WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE UNUSUAL BEFORE I ASKED US TO GO TO QUESTIONS IT'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO WE'RE GIVING HIM THE CHANCE TO MAKE HIS OWN CASE
DIRECTLY AND INTERRUPTED WE WILL OF COURSE HERE A PROMINENT FIGURE FROM THE OTHER SIDE MAKE THEIR ARGUMENT IN THE SAME WAY IN THE DAYS TO COME THIS THEN IS MICHAEL GOES ARGUMENT AS TO WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE LEAVE IN THE REFERENDUM
I WANT US TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAFER CHOICE FOR BRITAIN IF WE VOTE TO STAY WE'RE NOT SETTLING FOR A SECURE STATUS QUO WERE VOTING TO BE HOSTAGES LOCKED IN THE BACK OF THE CAR DRIVEN HEADLONG TOWARDS DEEPER INTEGRATION
BRUSSELS HAS ALREADY SET OUT SOME OF ITS PLANS FOR THE NEXT GREAT TRANSFER OF POWERS TO THE E.U. IN WHAT'S CALLED THE FIVE PRESIDENTS REPORT THE E.U. IS CLEAR IT WANTS MORE POWER OVER OUR TAXES AND OUR BANKS
SADLY WE'VE SURRENDERED A VETO ON THESE MOVES
AND WHAT'S WORSE IF WE TRY TO OBJECT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE CAN OVERRULE US
THE BEEN STRENGTHENED RECENTLY THROUGH THE NEW CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IT COULD NOW CONTROL HOW WE APPLY ASYLUM RULES
OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES MONITOR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS AND EVEN WHO WE CAN DEPORT
AND JUST AS WE ARE LOSING ALL THIS POWER WERE ALSO ON THE HOOK TO PAY MORE MONEY TO THE E.U. AS NEW COUNTRIES JOIN THE UNION
BUT IF YOU WERE TO LEAVE WE CAN TAKE BACK CONTROL WE CAN TAKE BACK THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS THAT WE GIVE TO THE E.U. EVERY WEEK WE CAN THEN SPEND MORE AND OUR PRIORITIES LIKE THE N.H.S.
WE CAN TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR ECONOMY THE E.U. HAS FAILED TO SECURE TRADE DEALS WITH A HUGE ECONOMIES OF INDIA CHINA AND AMERICA
OUTSIDE THE E.U. WE CAN CUT THOSE DEALS
OUTSIDE THE E.U. WE STILL BENEFIT FROM THE FREE TRADE ZONE WHICH CURRENTLY STRETCHES FROM ICELAND TO THE RUSSIAN BORDER
BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THE E.U. REGULATIONS WHICH COST OUR ECONOMY SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS EVERY WEEK
WE CAN TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS INSIDE THE E.U. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT ANYONE WITH AN E.U. PASSPORT EVEN IF THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD CAN BREEZER DEBRIS
THAT FREEDOM WILL BE EXTENDED TO PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES IN THE PIPELINE TO JOIN THE E.U. ALBANIA MACEDONIA AND MONTENEGRO AND SERBIA AND TURKEY
OUTSIDE THE E.U. WE COULD HAVE A POINTS BASED SYSTEM LIKE AUSTRALIA
WE COULD WELCOME TOWN TO PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE WORLD BUT BLOCK THOSE WHOSE PRESENCE HERE ISN'T IN OUR INTERESTS
IS A GREAT COUNTRY IS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WITH THE WORLD'S BEST ON FORCES BEST HEALTH SERVICE AND BEST BROADCASTER
WERE FIRST IN THE WORLD FOR SOFT POWER THANKS TO OUR LANGUAGE CULTURE AND CREATIVITY AND YET THE ENCAMP TRY TO SUGGEST THAT WERE TOO SMALL AND TOO WEAK
AND UH PEOPLE ARE TWO HAPLESS AND FECKLESS TO SUCCEED WITHOUT JEAN CLAUDE YOU LOOKING AFTER US
THAT'S A DEEPLY PESSIMISTIC AND NEGATIVE VISION BRITAIN COULD DO BETTER
WE A UNIQUELY INVENTIVE NATION AND OUR GREATEST INVENTION IS REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO RUN OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY US AND CAN BE KICKED OUT BY US
THAT'S WHY IT'S TIME TO TAKE BACK CONTROL THAT WAS MICHAEL GOES PERSONAL VIEW JUST TO REPEAT WE WILL OF COURSE HERE THE OTHER SIDE IN THE SAME WAY ON ANOTHER DAY BUT I'D SAY THE JUSTICE SECRETARY IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING
YOU WERE GIVEN SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL THREE MINUTES OF AIRTIME TO SAY WHAT YOU LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT HOSTAGES YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DANGER OF CRIMINALS AND IMMIGRANTS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS FAR FROM BEING A POSITIVE VISION THIS WAS YOU CONJURING YOUR BOGEYMEN ABOUT STAYING IN THE WAS NO I WAS VERY VERY CLEAR INITIALLY ABOUT THE RISKS OF REMAINING BUT I WAS ALSO VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE POSITIVES IF WE LEAVE IF WE LEAVE WE CAN TAKE BACK CONTROL OF THEIR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS
THAT WE GAVE TO THE Y. YOU EVERY WEEK AND WE CAN THEN SPEND IT ON OUR PRIORITY LIST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BATS TO THE WEEK AS YOU WELL KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A REBATE WE DON'T GIVE THAT MUCH WHAT TWO THINGS WE ACTUALLY HAVE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS BUT AROUND THE FIGURE DOWN TO AN OFFICE I DO WHAT INCLUDES DUE TO FISCAL STUDIED LET'S MOVE ON NOT ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS WHICH IS AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT BODY BUT MORE THAN THAT YOU MENTIONED THE RE PICNIC THE REBATE ISN'T IN ANY OF THE TREATIES AFTER WE HAVE VOTED IN THIS REFERENDUM IF YOU VOTE TO REMAIN
THEN THERE IS A REAL RISK THAT A REBATE COULD BE WHITTLED AWAY IT WOULD BE OPEN TO OTHER E.U. NATIONS TO SEEK TO REDUCE IT AND AS OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES DRAWING THEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
THAT THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE E.U. WOULD EXPECT US TO PAY IN WILL INEVITABLY RISE IT'S ALREADY THE CAKES THAT WERE ON THE HOOK TO PAY MORE BY TWENTY TWENTY AS THINGS STAND I INTERRUPTED YOU WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO SET OUT AND HAD SET OUT A POSITIVE VISION LET ME HELP YOU OUT A BIT THERE ARE PEOPLE LISTENING TO MAYBE NODDING ALONG TO ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU SAID THAT I DON'T MUCH LIKE THAT DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THAT
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUT LOOKS LIKE WHAT WILL THE U.K. BE LIKE IF WE'RE OUTSIDE WHAT RELATIONSHIP WOULD WE HAVE WITH OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBOURS AND OUR MOST IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNERS WOULD HAVE YACHTS WE WOULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF FREE TRADE AND FRIENDLY CO OPERATION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DEMOCRATIC SELF GOVERNMENT THE MODEL OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST AND OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA AND CANADA USED TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
CAN BE DEPLOYED BY US IN ORDER TO SPEND MONEY ON OUR PRIORITIES AND INDEED IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE A NEW TRADE DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA FORGIVE ME I WANT TO PURSUE YOUR POSITIVE VISION OF WHAT OUTLOOK LIKE SO FREE TRADE LIKE CANADA WHAT NOW AS YOU KNOW LET'S JUST TAKE THAT EXAMPLE COS YOU MENTION CANADA CANADA IS FORCED UNDER ITS FREE TRADE DEAL WITH INVERTED COMMAS TO PAY TARIFFS ON ITS SURFACES TO PAY TERRORISTS LOOK MANUFACTURING COMPONENTS TO PAY TARIFFS FOR MANY FARMING GOODS AS WELL
SO IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN HOPE FOR ABSOLUTELY NOT ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE IS THAT IT PROVES THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE MODEL THAT BRITAIN HAS TO ACCEPT WHICH IS A CURRENTLY EXISTING ALTERNATIVE SO HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE'D BE PART OF A EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA
IT'S ALREADY THE CASE AS A EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA THAT EXTENDS FROM ICELAND TO THE RUSSIAN BORDER THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN LANDMASS OUTSIDE THAT IS BELARUS WE WOULD BE PART OF THAT AND WE WOULD BENEFIT ALSO FROM BEING ABLE TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR SEAT
ON THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION AT THE MOMENT BRITAIN IS REPRESENTED ON THE W.T.O. BITHIDH E. USE SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE AND EX SOCIOLOGY LECTURER FROM SWEDEN I'D LIKE TO SEE A BRITAIN ON THE W.T.O. DETERMINING TRAY POLICY MORE THAN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BARRIERS TRADE BARRIERS THAT WE'VE ERECTED IN THE Y. U. AGAINST DEVELOPING NATIONS COME DOWN WITH A LITTLE BIT
WOULD WE BE IN THE EUROPEANS IN THEM UP WE WILL BE PART OF A FREE TREATS WE WOULD NOT BE IN THE EUROPEAN SITES IN THE MARKET WE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE COUNTRIES OF THE SINGLE MARKET BY BEING IN THE FREE TRADE HALL NO FORGIVE ME CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT MARGARET THATCHER IT WAS NOMINATED THE SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF WHAT SHE CALLED INVISIBLE BARRIERS IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE CITY OF LONDON FOR EXAMPLE LEGAL COMPANIES NOT JUST BANKS AND YOU'RE A FRENCH BANCHORY ARE GERMAN LEAGUE OF YOU WERE WRECKED INVISIBLE BARRIERS TO TRADE YOU SAY YOU DON'T MEET OUR STANDARDS
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE SUPERMARKET AND THEREFORE HAVE NO LEGAL PROTECTION AGAINST THOSE BARRIERS WE WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TRADE FREELY WITH ALL OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT WOULDN'T BE IN THEIR INTEREST TO A WRECKED BARRIERS BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT REPEATEDLY THERE IS A TRADE DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE FIGURE MAYBE PERFECTLY END THE GERMANS INTEREST TO SAY WE DON'T LIKE COMPETITION FROM THE CITY OF LONDON WE DON'T LIKE COMPETITION MADE THE BABY THE FRENCH BANKS WOULD SAY THEY SAY IT NOW
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT OF REDRESS WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TO THEIR COUNTRIES AND TO THEIR PEOPLES WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR GOVERNMENT DELIBERATELY ERECT BARRIERS THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WOULD LOSE JOBS LOU'S INVESTMENT AND LOSE INCOME AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT THE SINGLE MARKET WE DID TEND TO TAKE THE VIEWS OF FRENCH MINISTERS AND GERMAN MINISTERS MORE SERIOUSLY
WOULDN'T WE THAN YOURS ON THIS AND WALK I'M SURE HE SAID HE'S THE GERMAN ECONOMICS MINISTER EMANUEL MICRON THE FRENCH ECONOMICS MINISTER SAID IT BUT YOU KNOW THEIR MIND BET NO I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE INTERESTS AND SO DO GERMAN INDUSTRIOUS AND FRED FROM WHAT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR ECONOMIES AND THAT IS TO CONTINUE TO TRADE FREELY WITH BRITAIN THERE'S ANOTHER THING AS WELL YOU MAKE A POINT ABOUT THE SINGLE MARKET BUT ACTUALLY BRITAIN HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAPE THE SINGLE MARKET IN HER INTERESTS WITH THERE HAVE BEEN ANY NUMBER OF OCCASIONS EIGHTY OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE VOTED AGAINST
RULES WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN UNDER QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTING IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND WE HAVE LOST ANY LACK THAT INFLUENCE AND IT IS THE CASE THAT GERMAN CAR MANUFACTURERS OR FRENCH FARMERS OR ITALIAN FASHION DESIGNERS ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO ERECT NEW BARRIERS OF CUT WAS THERE NOT THERE AND GAVE IT SELLING TO US YOU CHOOSE THE EXAMPLES WHICH ARE LEAST LIKELY TO WANT TO PUT BARRIERS UP
THE REASON YOU DON'T SAY GERMAN BANKS THE REASON YOU DON'T SAY FRENCH INSURANCE COMPANIES IS YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE REASON MARGARET THATCHER FOUGHT FOR THE SINGLE MARKET OF COURSE PEOPLE WILL WANT TO SEND A FRENCH CHEESE AND GERMAN CARS THE ISSUE IS WHETHER THEY WILL WANT TO HAMPER THE CITY OF LONDON AND ALL THE SERVICE SECTOR THAT RIGHT ROUND THIS COUNTRY PEOPLE DEPEND FOR THEIR JOBS
THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE USING IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT WAS USED AT THE TIME OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE ARGUMENT THEN WAS THAT IF WE STAYED OUTSIDE THE SINGLE CURRENCY THAT NEW BARRIERS WOULD BE ERECTED THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE CITY OF LONDON AND SINCE WE STAYED OUTSIDE THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE THE CITY OF LONDON HAS BOOMED SO YOUR ARGUMENT I'M AFRAID IS THE SAME ERRONEOUS AND BOGUS ARGUMENT THAT WAS RUN IN THE PAST IF YOU ARE A SIDE THAT REGULATORY AND BIRD AND CREATING ENGINE THAT WE'LL LOSE THAT FORGIVE ME I JUST WANNA MOVE ON SOME OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS YOU'RE KEEN TO MAKE
COST MEN WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR WARNINGS IF WE MAY JUST BRIEFLY LET'S NOT ARGUE ABOUT THE FIGURES HERE BUT EVERY INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC FORECAST RIGHT AND FIND EVERY GLOBAL FORECAST ONE CAN FIND AN ORGANISATION SAYS THERE IS A COST TO LEAVING THE E.U. OR SHORT TERM SHOCK AND A LONG TERM COST
DO YOU DENY THAT BOTH THOSE COS EXIST I ABSOLUTELY DO YOU SAY THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT I'M SHOP AND A LONG TIME NOT AT ALL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC FORECAST HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM BENEFITS THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS OPEN EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE POINTED OUT IN RIDDING US OF SOME OF THE REGULATORY BURDENS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IT'S ALSO THE CASE OPEN EUROPE BIG THINK TANK BASED IN LONDON IS YOUR ANSWER TO
THE I.M.F. THE WORLD BANK THE O.E.C.D. THE TREASURY THE BANK OF ENGLAND IT'S ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER WE HAVE FORMER CHANCELLOR NIGEL LAWSON HAS MADE IT CLEAR WE'VE HAD DIGBY JONES THE FORMER HEAD OF THE C.B.I. HE'S MADE IT CLEAR WE'VE HAD SIMON WILSON A CHIEF EXEC TO THE NEXT HE'S MADE IT MEDICALLY AND JOHN LONG WITH THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WHO MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I WANT TO MOVE YOU ON FOR ECONOMICS COS YOU HAVE IN YOUR ESSAY IN YOU DOING YOUR SPEECH NO COST YOU SAY THAT LET'S JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
SO YOU THEN SAY BUT EUROPE IS PLANNING TO TAKE MORE PAT WHAT'S YOUR REMEMBER HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT PROMISED US THAT IF MORE POWS WERE TRANSFERRED THERE WOULD BE A REFERENDUM HAS GOT THE REFERENDUM LOCK
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT WOULDN'T WORK THAT IF THERE WERE NOW MORE POWERS BEEN DEMANDED FROM RUSSELL THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LAW DAVID CAMERON YOUR FRIEND PASSED SO THEY'D HAVE TO BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM THERE'LL BE NO USE THAT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING ON YOUR PART IN IT BECAUSE THE POINT ABOUT THE REFERENDUM LOCK IS THAT IF THERE'S A NEW TREATY
AND OF COURSE THERE'S A REFERENDUM BUT IT'S ALREADY THE CASE THAT WE SEE THAT THERE ARE NEW POWERS WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS AGGREGATE INTO ITSELF EVERY DAY THE BOATS THROUGH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND ALSO THROUGH THE THE PROCESS OF QUALIFIED MAJORITY VOTING IT IS THE CASE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES NOT NEED NEW TREATIES IN ORDER TO ADD TO THE POWERS THAT THE CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AND YOU'RE MAKING A VERY CONTROVERSIAL CLAIM I DON'T BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE SAYING IT
THAT INTELLIGENCE SHARING WITH THE UNITED STATES WILL BE UNDERMINED BY OR STAYING IN THE E.U. THE FACT THAT WE SHARE INTELLIGENCE NOT JUST WITH THE UNITED STATES WITH CANADA NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA IS AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION AND INDEED IN SOME CASES JEALOUSY ON THE PART OF OTHER E.U. NATIONS IT'S ALREADY BEEN THE CASE THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO INTERFERE IN OUR OWN SECURITY RULES THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T SEEK TO DO SO BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN CLEAR ON THE PART OF A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS THAT FAR FROM WANTING TO SEE GREAT WESTERN SOLIDARITY AND GREATER CO OPERATION WITH AMERICA IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM THEY WANTED TO GO THEIR OWN WAY NOW IT'S VERY STRIKING THAT YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HAVE CHOSEN TIE LIKE IMMIGRATION
TODAY PARTICULARLY THE THREAT AS YOU SEE IT HAVE GREATER IMMIGRATION HE'S THIS NOT THE TRUTH IN FACT THAT YOU ARE THE CAMPAIGN COMING UP WITH THE BOGEY MEN YOU ARE THE ONE SAYING
BEWARE THE FOREIGNER BEWARE WHERE THE IMMIGRANT AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU SAY THAT THEY REMAIN CAMPAIGNER TREATING PEOPLE LIKE CHILDREN AT THE SAME TIME YOU'VE TOLD THE PUBLIC IN RECENT DAYS AND I LIST THEM YOU CAN END AUSTERITY
YOU CAN SAVE THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY MORE MONEY WILL GO TO FARMERS AND THE N.H.S. WILL GET ALL THAT MONEY AT ALL WHAT THEY ALWAYS WANTED IS IT NOT FRANKLY A BIT INSULTING TO THE INTELLIGENCE TO SAY BY SIMPLY LEAVING ME DO ALL THOSE THINGS CAN HAPPEN NO IT'S NOT IT'S A POSITIVE VISION YOU TEXT ME EARLY WITH THE NEGATIVE ONE OF THE POSITIVE ARGUMENTS IN FACT ONE OF THE MEN PUT THE LOG IT'S I'VE MADE IS MORE MONEY FOR THE N.H.S. AND INDEED FOR OTHER PRIORITIES BECAUSE
WE CAN TAKE BACK THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS THAT WE SPEND EVERY WEEK THERE'S ANOTHER POSITIVE ARGUMENT AS WELL IN TERMS OF TRADE WE CAN LOWER TRADE BARRIERS TO DEVELOPING NATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS I'M MOST ANXIOUS TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN IMPORT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE FROM DEVELOPING NATIONS AND IN SO DOING NOT ONLY HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN GROWTH BUT ALSO GET CHEAPER FOOD IN THE U.K. VERY LAST AND BRIEF ONE
YOU'VE TOLD US THAT IF WE STAY IN THE AIR WE CAN'T CONTROL IMMIGRATION WE CAN'T DEAL WITH CRIMINALS AND WE CAN'T DEAL WITH ASYLUM CLAIMS PRESUMABLY IF WE VOTE TO REMAIN YOU SHOULD QUIT IT'S JUSTICE SECRETARY YOU CAN'T CARRY OUT YOUR DUTIES SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY IS THE EVIL THEREOF I'M TRYING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY SHOULD BE SHOULDN'T IT I'M TRYING BUT WE SHOULD GO FROM EUROPEAN AND SHOULD MAKE THE JOB HAVE YOU EVERY STAGE SHOULD LEAP IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JOBS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE JOBS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WOULD BENEFIT IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION SKILL THAT'S THEIR GREAT MIGHT THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND IF THEY WANT TO TAKE BACK CONTROL THEY CAN VOTE LEAVE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN YOU'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF TIME TO BE BORIS'S THANK YOU THAT WAS A PARTY ELECTION BROADCAST MICHAEL GO DON'T WORRY IF YOU'RE FINDING THAT ANNOYED YOU WILL HAVE ONE FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND NO DOUBT PEOPLE FIND THAT ANNOYING AS WELL I'M SURE THEY WON'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK PLEASURE
AND WILL HAVE THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL DOMINIC GRIEVE RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT MICHAEL GOPHERS MADE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT IMAGINE BUYING ONE TICKET AND GETTING TO SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE LIVE
GOODBYE DES AGAIN SOON FOR SOME MORE
THE SAME FAMILY AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO WELL THAT IS MORE THAN A FANTASY FESTIVAL LINE UP BECAUSE PAUL MCCARTNEY THE WHO THE ROLLING STONES NEIL YOUNG BOB DYLAN AND ROGER WATERS OF PINK FLOYD AND ALL REPORTED TO BE PLAYING THE SAME FESTIVAL COACHELLA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS OCTOBER THE STORY WAS BROKEN BY THE L.A. TIMES POP MUSIC WRITER RANDY LEWIS
REALLY EXTRAORDINARY LINE UP BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT HALF A DOZEN CATS THERE
JUST VIED ALL SHAPING JUST THE MUSIC POP MUSIC OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BUT THE POP CULTURE AND OUR WAVES AS WELL
THE ROLLING STONES PAUL MCCARTNEY WHO NEIL YOUNG AND ROGER WATERS OR WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE DOING IT BECAUSE NONE OF THESE ACTS REALLY NEED TO APPEAR AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL DO THEY THEY DON'T TODAY THEY HAVE ALL DONE FIRST OF ALL BUT THEY ARE CLEARLY
IN THEIR OWN RIGHT I THINK JUST THE COMBINATION OF THIS TALENT OF BRINGING TOGETHER THESE STOREROOMS PRIME ALL PRIMAL FORCES
RE EMERGENCE OF ROCK MUSIC IT WAS AN ART FORM IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES IS APPEALING TO THEM AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE I PRESUME WANNA COME SEE YOU AND YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE ATTRACTION FOR EACH OF THEM HAS BEEN THAT THE OTHERS WILL BE THERE IT'S THE STATEMENT THEY'LL MAKE TOGETHER I THINK
SPEAK TO NEIL YOUNG'S MANAGER AND HE SAID THAT THEY WERE VERY
ABLE TO NOT JUST PERFORM AT THE SHOW BUT BE ABLE TO HANG OUT WITH WITH THESE OTHER MUSICIANS OF ALL GO BACK A LONG WAYS PRETTY MUCH HALF A CENTURY
THAT THEIR PATHS HAVE CROSSED BEFORE THEY ALL KNOW ONE ANOTHER SO THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO BE A DOABLE SOCIALISING ONSITE THEMSELVES AND DO YOU THINK THEN THAT APPEARING TOGETHER IN IN THIS WAY IT WILL BE OF ITSELF A CULTURAL MOMENT SOMETHING THAT WE WILL REMEMBER I THINK
THE QUALITY OF THIS LINE UP THERE I THINK HAVING BOB DYLAN ON THE SHOW WITH ALL THE OTHER IS JUST REALLY ESTABLISHED AS THIS
CONCERT LINE UP OF OF THE HIGHEST ORDER HAD HAD TO TELL HAVE MANAGED TO BRING IT ABOUT DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A LONG TIME I THINK THIS HAS BEEN IN THE WORKSHOP I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW LONG IT'S BEEN IN THE WORKS
THE ORGANISERS OF THE FESTIVAL HOUSE HAD INTERACTIONS WITH WITH EACH OTHER PERFORMERS EITHER AT OR IN INDIA
SO THEY'RE A KNOWN QUANTITY I THINK THROUGH COLLEGE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MUSIC FESTIVAL
IN THE U.S. AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS IN THE WORLD AS ESTABLISHED CREDIBILITY WITH THESE PEOPLE AND TO TO BRING THEM TOGETHER I THINK JUST SPEAKS
THE STATUS THAT THEY HAVE IN THE TRUST THAT THEY'VE ENGENDERED WITH THE MUSICIANS THEY WERE US AND OF COURSE EXTREMELY GOOD FOR TICKET SALES AND I SUSPECT THAT'S NOT REALLY A PROBLEM PROBABLY FOR THIS FESTIVAL BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE CHANCES OF AN ORDINARY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC GETTING THEIR HANDS ON ONE OF THESE
WELL TAKE TICKETS HAVEN'T GONE AUSTRALIA THEY ACTUALLY HAVEN'T MADE THE FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DETAIL THAT'S IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE COMING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS I WOULD EXPECT
I THINK THE TAKE US PROBABLY WILL SHELL OUT QUICKLY BUT I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO SET THIS UP IN A AND WAVE IT WILL PROVIDE ACCESS FOR PEOPLE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEVELS WILL YOU WILL YOU BE THERE I DEFINITELY WILL BE THERE THAT'S YOU RANDY LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

I TALK TO STEPHEN SONDHEIM ALEC BALDWIN AND SOME GREAT AMERICAN SHAKESPEARE SCHOLARS TO DISCOVER HOW TODAY MORE THAN EVER
HE'S ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN THE U.S.A. JOIN ME ROBERT MCCRUM FOR SHAKESPEARE AND THE AMERICAN DREAM THIS MORNING AT NINE ON B.B.C. RADIO
LOOK AT THE WEATHER NOW A FINE AND BRIGHT DAY FOR MOST FOR SUNNY SPELLS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE NEIL SLEET HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY AND LEADING VOICE IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. MICHAEL GOPHERS ACCUSED THE REMAIN SIDE OF PATRONISING THE PUBLIC
IN A SPEECH IN LONDON HE'LL SAY THEY'RE TREATING VOTERS LIKE CHILDREN WHO CAN BE FRIGHTENED INTO OBEDIENCE REMAIN BACCHUS AIM IS TO GO OVER HE'S FOCUSING ON PROCESS BECAUSE HE LACKS A DETAILED VISION FOR WHAT BRITAIN WOULD BE LIKE OUTSIDE THE E.U. BUT SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME HE SAID A NUMBER OF ANALYSTS ARE DETERMINED THAT WOULD BE LONG TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO LEAVING
THE TALIBAN HAVE CARRIED OUT A SUICIDE ATTACK IN THE CENTRE OF THE AFGHAN CAPITAL KABUL EYE WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED AN EXPLOSION AND GUNFIRE MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED AND AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED INJURED
A GROUP OF M.P.S WILL TODAY BEGIN AN INQUIRY INTO THE SCALE AND IMPACT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH FOR THE WOMEN AND THE QUALITY'S COMMITTEE SUGGESTS PUPILS ARE OFTEN BULLIED INTO SEXUAL ACTIVITY THAT THE MANY ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED FOR STUDY SUGGESTS THE DINOSAURS WERE ALREADY IN LONG TERM DECLINE WHEN THEY WERE WIPED OUT BY A LARGE ASTEROID THAT HIT THE EARTH SIXTY SIX MILLION YEARS AGO THE RESEARCH SAYS THEY'D ALREADY BEGUN DYING OUT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T COPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE BRITAIN IS READY TO SUPPORT LIBYA'S ARMED FORCES SAID THE FOREIGN SECRETARY IN TRIPOLI YESTERDAY RAISING SPECULATION THAT HUNDREDS OF BRITISH TROOPS ARE ABOUT TO BE SENT TO LIBYA AS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE FORCE PHILIP HARBEN SAID IT WAS UP TO THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHAT SORT OF HELP IT NEEDED BUT IF IT DOES WANT FOREIGN MILITARY HELP HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT ITS FIGHT TO REGAIN TERRITORY FROM THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE GROUP
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY TWO PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTRY CANNOT RUPERT WE LOCK WAS THE SENIOR BRITISH COMMANDER THERE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND JOE WALKER COUSINS WAS THE HEAD OF THE BRITISH EMBASSY'S OFFICE IN BENGHAZI FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH AND CAROL WE LOCK IF THE WORD FROM TRIPOLI IS YES WE WANT FOREIGN FORCES HOW SHOULD WE RESPOND
I BELIEVE THERE ARE TASKS THAT THE MILITARY CAN TOO OUT THERE AND IN TERMS OF PROVIDING EXTRA STABILITY AND SECURITY HAD TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT IF WE HAVE AN INVITATION THE KEY THING IF WE'RE GOING BACK INTO LIBYA IS THAT WE NEED SOME FORM OF INVITATION A GUIDE AND WE ALSO NEED THE STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD ALLOW OUR TROOPS TO OPERATE PROPERLY BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING AN INVITATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF A COUNTRY AND HAVING POPULAR SUPPORT TO BE
MY EXPERIENCE OF THE LIBYAN PEOPLE IS THAT THEY WANT PEACE AND STABILITY AND IF THAT MEANS SOME FORM OF ASSISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE IN A PARTNERING ARRANGEMENT WHERE THEY HAVE THE LEAD THEN I BELIEVE THEY WOULD SUPPORT THAT AND A WINNER WHEN YOU SAY THAT THERE ARE TASKS THAT THE MILITARY COULD DO THAT THE BRITISH MILITARY COULD DO
WHAT ARE THOSE UP TO FIGHT IN LIBYA TO PATROL THE COAST TO TRAIN THE LIBYAN ARMY WHAT SHOULD WE DO WE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS THAT THE BRITISH PUBLIC WANT TO SEE THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES USED IN A BIN EFFICIENT BETTER BENEFITS AND WAY I'D ALSO USED MORE AS A SCALPEL THAN A BUTCHER'S CLEAVER
SO THERE IS SOME SUPPORT IN TERMS OF THE ASSISTANCE IN ISLAMIC STATE WHICH IS A RECOGNISED ENEMY THERE BY ALL THE LIBYANS YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE DOING IN LIBYA IT'S A NARROW BOAT WHICH WE COULD ASSIST THEM BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO USE OUR FORCES I THINK THE KEY AREA WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT HIS TRADING AND EDUCATING AND MENTORING THE ARMED FORCES TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN CAPABILITY
SO THAT THEY CAN DO THE JOB THEMSELVES JOE WALKER COUSINS FROM THE DIPLOMATS POINT OF VIEW HOW HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THE PROSPECT OF OF OF ANOTHER MILITARY PRESENCE INTERVENTION OF SOME KIND IN THERE
WELL MY GUT REACTION IS TO SAY WITH GREAT TREPIDATION BUT I THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY SLIGHTLY UNFAIR I THINK THAT'S CLEARLY THEY ARE CLEARLY MAJOR CHALLENGES ON THE GROUND IN IN IN LIBYA BOTH TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL AND SOME FORM OF ENGAGEMENT AN INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF ASKING WHEN YOU OPEN UP YOUR DIPLOMATIC TOOLBOX WHICH TOOLS DO YOU THINK ARE REQUIRED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
THE MILITARY OF COURSE IS ONLY ONE TOOL WE HAVE DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL TOOLS WE HAVE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TOOLS AS WELL AND I WOULD ALWAYS ARGUE THAT THE MILITARY INTERVENTION SHOULD BE THE VERY VERY LAST TOOL TO USE A CUE DO YOU THINK THAT A LOOKING AT LIBYA AS IT STANDS AT PRESENT IT IS PART OF THEIR TOOL KIT THAT WE SHOULD DEPLOY
I THINK IT IS PART OF IT BUT IT'S NOT THE LARGEST PART I THINK BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES THE BIG CHALLENGES THAT LIBYA FACES AT THE MOMENT ARE ESSENTIALLY POLITICAL THE MANIFESTATION OF A YES AND THE MILITIA TAKEOVER OF TRIPOLI BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE INTERN OR SEEN WARFARE BETWEEN THE TRIBES THESE ARE A MANIFESTATION OF A MUCH GREATER A LONG RUNNING UNDERLYING POLITICAL CHALLENGE
WHICH IF THAT IS NOT ADDRESSED ANY SORT OF MILITARY INTERVENTION NOW CAN ONLY REALLY ADD FUEL TO THE FIRE THE CAMERA CAMERA POLITICAL CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BE ADDRESSED BY OUTSIDERS AT ALL THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I ALWAYS ARGUED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A VERY SORT OF HANDS OFF APPROACH MAKE SURE THAT WE SORT OF IDENTIFY WHO'S POPULAR ON THE GROUND AND WHO HAS A LONG TERM STEAK AND SOMEONE THAT WE CAN BAG AND THEN LET THEM CRACK ON AND DO THE JOB
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT FOR FOREIGNERS TO GET IN THERE AND TELL THEM WHO'S ACCEPTABLE WHO'S NOT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH IS THE MOST MILITIAS IT'S A VERY VERY HOT TOPPING CANNOT WEREDOG ISN'T THE HANDS OFF APPROACH PART OF HOW WE'VE ENDED UP IN THIS SITUATION IN LIBYA YOU WERE VERY SOON AFTER THE AIR STRIKES IT ESSENTIALLY TO SIMPLIFY BUT WE WERE PART OF THE AIR STRIKES AND THEN WE SORT OF DISAPPEARED
YES I THINK I THINK WE DID WE DID BECOME DISTRACTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HER BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME BIG CHALLENGES ELSEWHERE EGYPT WAS IN A FAR WORSE CASE AND SITUATION AND THE LIP IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND THEN CYRIL BLEW UP HOWEVER THE THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT LIBYA IS IS THAT IF THEY DO INVITE US IN AT THE HIGH LEVEL AND WE CAN SEE THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT'S NATIONAL CALLED HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS
THE VERY FACT THAT THEY COULD ONLY GET IN BY BOAT CLUB BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND NOW THEY HAVE GOT SOME SUPPORT FROM THOSE WHO CONTROL THE AIR SPACE AND A FOREIGN SECRETARY FLEW IN HER TO DECAY TWO DAYS AGO SHOWS THAT THEY'RE THERE IS PROGRESS BEING MADE
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SMALL STEPS TO SUPPORT THAT IS THERE STILL TIME TIP TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME JOE WALKER COUSINS DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF OUR ATTENTION TO THIS PARTICULAR COUNTRY I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WIND BACK THE CLOCK BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES IN THE PAST AND HOPE FIRSTLY WE NEED TO BE ENGAGING
POLITICALLY IN LIBYA AND WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD PUT A BIG QUESTION MARK OVER THE CURRENT PROCESS WITH REGARDS TO THE CAN ACTIVITY BETWEEN THIS HIS PRESIDENCY COUNCIL IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THE VARIOUS CAN TWO CONSTITUENCIES THAT THEY REPORTEDLY REPRESENT
I THINK THE SECOND THING WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT THE COUNTRY'S IS WEAPONISED TO AN EXTENT THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE AND WERE TRYING TO PUSH SOME SORT OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ANY GROUP IF THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WILL BE ABLE TO PICK UP ARMS AND USE THEM TO THEIR OWN A FACT AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO BE RIGHT AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MIND JOE WALKER COUSINS AND KENNEL RUPERT WE LOCK THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE HORRIFIC IMAGES OF HOSTAGES BEING BEHEADED BEHEADED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE CAN LEAD YOU TO FORGET THE SUMMER HOSTAGES DO YOU GET OUT THEY DO GET RELEASED A GROUP OF NINETEEN WESTERN HOSTAGES WHO HELD BY I S. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN INCLUDED JAMES FOLEY
ALAN HENNING AND DAVID HAINES WHO WERE ALL MURDERS BUT A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPOND LEADS TO SET HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO FOUR HOSTAGES WHO WERE JUST A LITTLE BIT LUCKIER LISE IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THEM AN EXTRAORDINARY EMOTIONAL OCCASION WHEN THEY CAME BACK TOGETHER
AND IN SOME SENSE RELIVE THEIR EXPERIENCE I WAS ONE OF THE MOST TOUCHING MOMENTS TO BE A WITNESS TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY THIS TESTIMONY OF SURVIVAL FOR THE MET HIM IN A PUB IN LONDON AND IF YOU READ A DISTANCE YOU THINK YOU'RE READY FOR BLOKES HAVING A DRINK IN A PUB BUT THIS WAS
BUT MULDER YOU A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT BUT IT'S ALSO A REMINDER THAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFIC OF HORRIFIC EVENTS OF OUR TIME TO BE TAKEN HOSTAGE BY THE MOST BRUTAL OF HOSTAGE TAKERS AND YOU JUST MENTIONED THOSE HORRIFIC A BEHEADING VIDEOS AND SADLY BRITISH AID WORKER DAVID HAINES ALAN HENNING THE TAXI DRIVER TRYING VOLUNTEER THAT WAS THEIR FEET AND SO FOR THOSE WHO SURVIVE FREEDOM

ARE YOU PACING UP AND DOWN YOUR MATTRESS THREE HUNDRED TIMES TWICE A DAY BECAUSE JUST TO PASS THE TIME IN TO GET AND TO KEEP FIT MAKING A CHESS SET OUT OF CURTAIN MELKA CUT SHE'S CARTONS IN ORDER TO TO PASS THE TIME JUST LISTEN TO SOME OF THE STORIES OF THESE THESE FOUR PEOPLE FOR DID NOT DANIEL RHIA'S YOUNG STUDENTS OR DID YOU FRANCOIS A WAR CORRESPONDENT WHO I'VE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AND END OR SOAPY ATOCHA HEIRS WAS ALSO IN HIS TWENTIES
I STARTED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I WAS IN A JAR IN THE DESERT AND THERE WERE ALSO OTHER PRISONERS AND AT ONE STAGE I I HEARD THAT THEY WERE CURING SOME OF THEM SO I STARTED TO REALLY FREAK OUTS BEEN CURED IN THE SHADOW DIESER KARIM
IT'S WHERE MOST MEAN REALLY SHOT IT WAS LIKE JUST COMPLETELY BLACK CELL MAYBE A METRE BY THREE WITH A WITH A TOILET AND FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS NOTHING
DAYS AND DAYS OF SOLITUDE I HAD GUY GIVING ME A PLATE OF BAKED BEANS IN THE MORNING AND SOME OLIVES
BIT OF BREAD IN THE EVENING AND WATER
DANIEL YEAH STARTED COUNTING A LOT I THINK THE SURVIVOR MOAT THAT YOU GO INTO WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF IT'S VERY INTERESTING YOU JUST THERE
WITH YOUR BRAIN YOURSELF AND I COULD HAVE GOOD TIMES WHEN I THOUGHT O.K. EVERYTHING EVERYTHING'S GOOD AND THEN I COULD HAVE BARE TIMES SHE WENT SO I GOES YOU PLEASE AGAIN THAT'S WHAT I MEAN EVERYBODY STAYS IN THE GAME
IT'S JUST DON'T TRY TO PROJECT YOURSELF IN THE FUTURE OR BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY DISAPPOINTED YOU HAVE ONE DAY TO SURVIVE SURVIVE ONE DAYS AT YOU SEE IT'S A
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND GAME OF SURVIVAL IN THE GUARDS TRYING TO REDUCE THEM OF ANIMALS IN THE WHOLE CENTRED AMONG THE GUARDS SADLY THE BRITISH WERE AMONG THE BRITISH HOSTAGE TAKERS WERE AMONG THE MOST VIOLENT BUT DANIEL RIGHT CAME CLOSE TO BREAKING THIS IS HIS ACCOUNT I WAS AT A POINT WHEN I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NOT SURVIVE
UM BUT THAT TRY TO ESCAPE AND I ACTUALLY TRIED TO SO HANG MYSELF WHICH I WAS RESCUED HER TIE
THE BAD GUYS BUT THEY CAME IN AND THEY TOOK ME DOWN AND EVERYTHING WAS O.K. AND I REALLY FELT THAT A LEG IT WENT THROUGH MY MIND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE LIKE
THEY WILL NOT KILL ME THEY DECIDED THAT MAYBE I JUST BECAME A PART OF YOU KNOW WELL WERE FUNCTIONING TORTURE CENTRE
WE CAN HEAR MORE OF THAT IN YOUR PROGRAMME HELD HOSTAGE IN SYRIA ON RADIO FOUR EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT BUT JUST FOR PEOPLE A LITTLE WORRIED BY THAT LAST BIT THERE ARE LIGHT MOMENTS THERE ARE UPLIFTING MOMENTS THERE ARE MOMENTS OF LAUGHTER THE WHOLE THING IS TO REMAIN HUMAN AND YOU DO SO WITH HUMOUR AND GRACE AND SOLIDARITY THESE TO SAY THANK YOU EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT I'M READY FOR THAT I WAS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE PART OF THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOES RATIONALE FOR VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. WHICH WE HEARD ON THIS PROGRAMME THE LAST HALF HOUR
IS BASED ON THE WAY HE BELIEVES IT'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS MOVING GREATER POWERS FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE INCLUDING HE SAYS HOW WE TREAT ASYLUM CASES AND HOW OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES MONITOR SPLIT SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WE JOIN UP FROM OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO BY DOMINIC GRIEVE M.P. FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OUR CHAIR OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY COMMITTEE HE'S IN FAVOUR OF A VOTE TO REMAIN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DID YOU THINK OF WHAT MICHAEL GAVE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS WORRIES ABOUT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE BEING STRENGTHENED AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR US
I THOUGHT THAT THE EXAMPLES HE PROVIDED WERE UNFOUNDED AND INDEED UNTENABLE SO FOR EXAMPLE HIS SUGGESTION THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE WAS INTERFERING WITH THE ABILITY OF OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES TO DO THEIR WORK IS SIMPLY ROLL THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY SUGGESTION FROM A FIVE EYES PARTNERS THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE MIGHT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO CO OPERATE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY INSTANCE
IN WHICH THERE'S BEEN A CASE THAT COULD UNDERMINE THAT CO OPERATION WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HAS THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TO INTERFERE IN THESE SORTS OF AREAS AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO THINK THAT IT WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN IN THE WAY THAT THE INTELLIGENCE SHARING PACKED IS ACTUALLY USED BY THE U.K. I THINK HE'S LABOURING UNDER A VERY SERIOUS MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THERE TO INTERPRET THE TREATIES
THE TREAT IS DON'T COVER NATIONAL SECURITY NOW I ACCEPT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN HAVE SOME AREAS OF OVERLAP THERE'S BEEN THE RECENT CASE BROUGHT BY HIS COLLEAGUE AND MY COLLEAGUE DAVID DAVIES WHO ALSO WANTS TO LEAVE
THE E.U. INVOKING THE E.U. IN RESPECT OF DATA PRIVACY ALTHOUGH THAT CASES NOT YET DETERMINED IN EUROPE AND INDEED OUR OWN COURT OF APPEAL DOUBTED THAT THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR JUDICIAL AUTHORISATION SHOULD HAVE DATA ACCESS BUT THESE THESE ARE FAR REMOVED FROM INTERFERING WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE RELATIONSHIP AND EVEN IF THAT JUDGEMENT WERE TO GO AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
IT WOULDN'T MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD SIMPLY REQUIRE A CHANGE TO THE LAW WE'RE CURRENTLY INACTIVE EMPIRE IS THE POTENTIAL TO DO SO HE IS THE JUSTICE SECRETARY THAT IS WHAT HE IS SAYING AND YOU ARE NOT IN A PUB YOU COULDN'T RULE THAT OUT COULD YOU THAT IN THE FUTURE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE MIGHT WANT TO GIVE JUDGEMENTS RELATING TO THIS AREA THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH WHAT MICHAEL SAYS IS THAT HE'S BEEN HAD A FAIRLY CONSISTENT PATTERN SINCE THE START OF THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WITH COMING OUT WITH STATEMENTS WHICH SIMPLY DON'T BEAR PROPER SCRUTINY
HE ALLEGED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S BRUSSELS AGREEMENT THAT HE'D SECURED WASN'T WORTH THE PAPER IT'S WRITTEN ON AND NO INTERNATIONAL LAWYER HAS AGREED WITH HIM INDEED I DON'T THINK HIS OWN DEPARTMENT WOULD AGREE WITH HIM ON THAT SO I
I'M ALWAYS WILLING TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT WHAT HE SAYS AND OF COURSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT IN THIS DEBATE THAT WE'RE HAVING ON OUR FUTURE WITHIN THE E.U. WE SHOULD TRY TO LOOK AT ALL SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT BUT SIMPLISTIC STATEMENTS WHICH ARE NOT BACKED BY ANY CREDIBLE EVIDENCE I'M NOT HELPFUL THAT TO SKY LET'S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF THE CASES THOUGH WHERE WHERE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HAS TAKEN A VIEW IT HAS GOT INTO AREAS THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER VERY MUCH ABOUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE HE GAVE AN OPINION
IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN ABOUT THE ABOUT THE U.K.'S REQUEST TO BE ABLE TO DEPORT ABU HAMZA'S DAUGHTER IN LAW ON THE BASIS OF A SERIOUS CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR A SERIOUS CRIMINAL OFFENCE AND IT SAID THAT WAS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON TO DEPORT HER SHE HAS A CHILD BORN IN BRITAIN TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR MAYBE AREAS CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF E.U. CITIZENS WHERE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE MAY LOOK LOOK AT THE ISSUE BUT IN FACT THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS RATHER MORE LIKELY
TO BE THE ISSUE HERE AND THAT OF COURSE IS UNCONNECTED TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE ALL THE E.U. ITSELF WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOUR NOSE OUT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE THAT IS AN E.U. INSTITUTION YET IS IT UNDOUBTEDLY AN E.U. INSTITUTION AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THAT THERE AREN'T POTENTIAL AREAS ARE GREY AREAS ON THE OVERLAP US TO WEAR EUROPEAN COMPETENCE LIES THAT MAY NOT INVOLVE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IN FUTURE THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE EXAMPLES PUT FORWARD BY MICHAEL
A GENERAL IN THEIR NATURE THEY ARE NOT SUSTAINED BY CLEAR EVIDENCE AND IN SOME CASES THEY SEEM TO ME TO BE THE RESULT OF A SORT OF SINGLE ISSUE OBSESSION SO HE'S NO LONGER SEEING THE WOOD FOR THE TREES HE'S ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID WAS ABOUT THIS POINT THAT THOSE IN FAVOUR OF A LEE VOTE OFTEN TAKE ABOUT MAKE ABOUT TAKING BACK CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS
IT IS THE CASE ISN'T IT THAT THAT IN THE E.U. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THOSE WITH AN E.U. PULSE WHAT THEY HAVE TO BE A REALLY REALLY GOOD REASON NOT A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR EXAMPLE ON THE GROUNDS OF WHICH WE CAN EXCLUDE AN E.U. CITIZEN FROM A COUNTRY I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT IF YOU ASKED THE HOME SECRETARY SHE'LL TELL YOU THAT SHE'S EXCLUDED A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF E.U. NATIONALS COMING VERY OFTEN
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BUT IF SHE HAS A NEED TO DO IT SHE CAN BECAUSE YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THE PURPOSE OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT WITHIN THE E.U. IS IN ORDER TO FULFIL THE E.U. TREATIES IT IS NOT A RIGHT OF SOMEBODY WHO'S COMING OVER NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF WORK AND MIGHT HAVE SOME TERRORIST CONNECTION TO INSIST THAT THEY CAN BE ALLOWED IN AT DOVER IT'S NEVER BEEN THE CASE AND IT WON'T BE THE CASE AND FUTURE DOMINIC GRIEVE M.P. THANK YOU
THE TIME NOW IS NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE BLUEBELLS AT DOKI WOULD IN HERTFORDSHIRE HAVE BECOME VICTIMS OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS THE NATIONAL TRUST HAS ANNOUNCED IT'S CHARGING ENTRANCE FEES TO THE WOODS AS A CROWD CONTROL MEASURE BECAUSE THE BLUEBELLS HAVE ATTRACTED SO MANY VISITORS THAT THEY ARE GETTING TRAMPLED WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY NICKY BENNETT BAGGS WHO OWNS A BED AND BREAKFAST IN THE AREA GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE
I THINK IT WAS A ROAD ABOUT THE WORDS AND IT'S QUITE SAD IT HAD TO DO IF THEY'RE NOT CONTROLLED I BELIEVE THAT THIS DID NOT CONTROL MEASURES TO HELP PROTECT IT WITH THEY'LL GET DAMAGE DIDN'T DESTROIDO PREPARED TO TIME AND THEREFORE THE NATIONAL TRUST IN YOUR VIEW IS DOING THE RIGHT THINGS
DESCRIBED IT SAURUS OH IT'S GOOD IT'S NOT IT'S NOT VERY BIG IT'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE TO WHICH WORD AND I DON'T NEED IT IT'S A BIT AREAS PROBABLY A FEW HUNDRED YARD BY HE HUNDRED YARDS AND WE'VE GOT THE PUB GOING THROUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE TO GAVE THEIR BURIAL IN THE MORNING AND EVENING TO TAKE WHAT TO BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH AND IT'S JUST A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLATE DID WELL IT SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY LOVELY IT'S A SHAME TO PUT PEOPLE OFF SENIOR TO THEMSELVES
IS IT OR DID I PRESUME THOUGH THAT AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THE AIR MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR A BUSINESS LIKE YOURS YEAH GREAT I WOULD SEE THE BLUEBELLS ARE PROTECTED AND PEOPLE COME TO PEOPLE DIRECTION A FAIRLY COME STAY WITH ME JUST TO GO TO SLEEP ELWOOD IT'S ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKENDS THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS THE WAY TO PROTECT THEM IS NOT NECESSARILY TO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR FOR ENTERING BUT YOU NEED TO ORGANISE IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE THAT YOU CAN VISIT WITHOUT TRAMPLING OVER THERE PLEASE
DID HE PICK THEM I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY DO THAT I THINK ACTUALLY IT'S A LEGAL TO TAKE ME AND I JUST WONDER IF IT STILL HAPPENS I DO I HADN'T SEEN THAT NIGHT NICKY BENNETT BAGGS THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECIDED AGAINST ENSHRINING INTO LAW THE CONVENTION AND M.P.S WERE ALWAYS BE CONSULTED BEFORE BRITISH TROOPS WERE SENT INTO MILITARY ACTION IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FOUND SAID HE WANTED TO GO UP INTO THE ARMED FORCES TO PROTECT THE U.K. AND I QUOTE IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE CANNOT PREDICT AND TO AVOID SUCH DECISIONS BECOMING SUBJECT TO LEGAL ACTION THIS IS LEAD SOME INCLUDING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH
TO SUGGEST THAT MINISTERS ARE SECRETLY PLANNING TO SEND TROOPS TO LIBYA WITHOUT GIVING M.P.S SAY LET'S HEAR WHAT THE OPPOSITION THINK ABOUT THAT THE SHADOW JUSTICE SECRETARY LORD FAULKNER IS WITH US NOW WORRIED OR NOT SURPRISED NOT SURPRISED WORRIED THEIR POSITION IN RELATION TO
THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION IS FOR EXECUTIVE TO DECIDE HOW TROOPS HAD APPLIED BUT THEY SHOULD ALWAYS TELL PARLIAMENT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND GIVE PARLIAMENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YES OR NO COS IF YOU USE TROOPS OR YOU DON'T A PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT THAT IS NOT AN ENGAGEMENT WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINABLE BUT THERE WILL BE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH FOR OPERATIONAL REASONS YOU CAN'T TELL PARLIAMENT WHEN EVERYTHING THEN YOU SHOULD COME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
I'M NOT TOO BOTHERED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S IN A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION SET OUT IN THE CABINET MANUAL RATHER THAN A STATUTE BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM WOULD GIVE RISE TO THE COURT'S MAKING A DECISION BUT I DO THINK THE PRINCIPLES HAVE GOT TO BE CLEAR AND I THINK THERE IS THERE IS A PASSAGE IN THE STATEMENT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER OR WHOEVER'S MADE THE STATEMENT MUST FALLON SAYS TODAY WHICH IS WHERE YOU'RE EMBEDDED
WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY THEN IT MAY BE THAT WE WON'T QUITE TELL PARLIAMENT NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN GOT OUT THERE AND THAT IS WHY I'M WORRIED IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS WASN'T THERE THE SITUATION IN WHICH IT WAS REVEALED THAT BRITISH PILOTS AM PART IN AMERICAN RAIDS OVER SYRIA DESPITE THE FACT THE PARLIAMENT HAD NOT VOTED
FOR THE BOMBING OF SYRIA NOW THAT WOULD OPEN UP ANOTHER WHAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON HERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT HOW YOU DEFINE WHAT MILITARY DEPLOYMENT IS AND HOW MUCH WIGGLE ROOM YOU GIVE MINISTERS WELL EXACTLY AND YOU SHOULD GIVE MINISTERS WRIGGLE ROOM TO DEAL WITH A PROPER EMERGENCY YOU SHOULD GIVE MINISTERS WRIGGLE ROOM TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE KEPT SECRET WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO IS ALLOW MINISTERS TOO
AS IT WERE DEPLOY OUR ARMED FORCES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THEN SAY OH BY THE WAY WE AGREED THAT THEY COULD USE THE BEAN OPERATIONS AND WE DIDN'T TELL PARLIAMENT THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW YOU WERE OF COURSE FAMOUSLY NOT A MINISTER A CLOSE FRIEND OF TONY BLAIR DURING THE IRAQ WAR NOW THE DECISION WAS TAKEN NOT TO HAVE A CONVENTION AT THAT TIME ISN'T THE TRUTH THAT WHEN HE LOVED IRAQ WAR LOATHED EVERY PART OF IT NO GOVERNMENT COULD EVER GET AWAY WITH A MAJOR DEPLOYMENT WITHOUT HAVING PART OF ENTRIES
THAT'S CORRECT AND OF COURSE IN THE IRAQ WAR YOU WILL RECALL YOU WITH A POLITICAL EDGE OF B. B. C. AT THE TIME THERE WAS A MASSIVE DEBATE THERE WAS THEN A VOTE AT THE END OF THE DEBATE IN THE COMMONS AND THE UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IF THE COMMONS VOTED AGAINST THE DEPLOYMENT FOR THE PLANT WOULD NOT TAKE PLACE YOU KNOW ME I NEVER WANT TO INTRUDE ON INTERNAL LABOUR PARTY GREAT
WHY IS YOUR COLLEAGUE IN THE SHADOW CABINET THE SHADOW DEFENCE SECRETARY EMILY THORNBERRY THEREFORE SAYING THIS IS A SHABBY AND CYNICAL BREACH OF A GOVERNMENT PLEDGE YOU SOUND AS IF YOU DIGS BURFI SENSIBLE THING TO DO IN REALLY WELL AND I THINK WHAT EMILY'S REFERRED TO IS YOU'VE GOT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS SEEK PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL
EXCEPT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'VE IDENTIFIED IF THE POSITION IS THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO AVOID DOING THAT THEN IT IS THE WRONG THING AND THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT PASSAGE IN THEIR STATEMENT REFERS TO THE PASSAGE ABOUT EMBEDDED IN OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD TO BRIEF FINAL WORD IF YOU WOULD WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MICHAEL GAVE WITHOUT FROM DOMINIC GRIEVE A SURFEIT OF LAW OFFICERS AND FOR THE LAW OFFICE
ABOUT WHETHER THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THAT LUXEMBOURG TAUGHT NOT THE HUMAN RIGHTS ON IS EFFECTIVELY READY TO INTRUDE INTO A WHOLE SERIES OF NEW AREAS WHETHER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ASYLUM SEEKING AND SO ON WHAT IS YOUR JUDGEMENT IT'S NOT I MEAN IT RIGHT FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE IN RELATION TO DATA
WE SHARE DATA AND IT'S GOOD DONE THROUGH ORGANISATIONS LIKE GOOGLE IT'S DONE BY GOVERNMENTS BUT IT'S GOT TO BE CLEAR IT'S DONE PURSUANT TO STRICT RULES FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HAS ALWAYS ENFORCE THOSE STRICT RULES TO ENFORCE PRIVACY SO THAT WHEN YOUR DATA IS GIVEN TO A EUROPEAN COUNTRY IT'S ONLY UNDER STRICT TERMS AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE POSITION FOR MICHAEL GO TO SAY IT'S ABOUT TO INTRUDE IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG IN RELATION TO ASYLUM THE POSITION IS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT AS DOMINIC GRIEVE WAS JUST SAYING AS HAD THE POWER TO EXPEL OR EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM EUROPE BUT SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS PROVISIONS WHICH SAY YOU CAN'T BREAK UP FAMILY LIFE EXCEPT WHEN THERE'S ABOUT A NON INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE THAT'S NOT DEALT WITH BY THE E.C. JAY THAT THE E.C. JAY ISSUE THAT MICHAEL WAS REFERRING TO WAS ABOUT DATA SHARING THERE WILL BE TIME FOR THAT
HIM WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AND IT'S ONLY THERE BUT THEY DO IT LORD FALCONER THANK YOU THAT'S ALL FROM US OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE ADAM COME A SKI AND TRACY RUBINSTEIN FROM ALL OF US GOOD MORNING
