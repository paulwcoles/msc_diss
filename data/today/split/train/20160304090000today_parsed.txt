WARNING THAT THEY'RE SMEARS AND THREATS COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE REFERENDUM IN JUNE
BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE A DISCOVERY WHICH THEY SAY COULD IMPROVE THE WAY SOME CANCERS ARE TREATED BY HELPING THE BODY IDENTIFY DISEASED CELLS AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME THE HOLLYWOOD ACTOR RICHARD GERE TELLS US WHY HE CHOSE TO EXPLORE THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND HIS LATEST FILM
THE WAY WERE BUILT AWAY OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BUILT AND SPIRITUALLY THERE WE ARE BUT WE NEED TO PLACE THE TARTS AND THAT'S HOW WE START TO INTEGRATE AND IDEA OF SELF IDENTITY THE OTHER THING WE NEED IS COMMUNITY
WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE AROUND US AND WE'LL BE ANNOUNCING THE CHOICE OF THE ARTIST CHOSEN TO REPRESENT BRITAIN AT THIS YEAR'S VENICE BIENNALE AND WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THEM AS WELL THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS STRONGLY ATTACKED THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE Y. YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE WAY IT'S BEEN CONDUCTED COULD CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT WRITING IN THE DAILY MAIL HE ACCUSES THE IN CAMPAIGN OF PUBLISHING HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE CLAIMS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF AN EXIT AND SUGGEST THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING SUCH CLAIMS COULD BE UNDERMINED IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC HEARS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
IN WHAT WILL BE SEEN AS IMPLICIT CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ALLIES IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAYS THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING WHAT HE CALLS DESPERATE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE E.U. IS AT STAKE FOR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY SAYS THE CAMPAIGN IS BEING CONDUCTED IN AN ACRIMONIOUS WAY AND APPEARS TO SUGGEST IT COULD DAMAGE THE GOVERNMENT AND BRITISH POLITICS BEYOND THE REFERENDUM
BOTH NUMBER TEN AND THE BRITAIN STRONGER IN EUROPE CAMPAIGN DECLINED TO COMMENT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS PREVIOUSLY CHORD FOR RESPECTFUL DEBATE
FRONTRUNNER SHOULD BE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS DONALD TRUMP HAS COME UNDER ATTACK FROM HIS TWO MAIN RIVALS IN THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE THE TYCOON WHO'S FACED A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM FROM SENIOR PARTY FIGURES WAS ACCUSED BY TED CREWS ARE FUNDING HILLARY CLINTON'S DEMOCRATIC ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND MARCO RUBIO SAID MISTER TRUMP DESERVED TO BE ATTACKED PERSONALLY BECAUSE HE'D MOCKED EVERYBODY FROM WASHINGTON HE'S LAURA BICKER
DES DONALD TRUMP HAS COME UNDER ATTACK MOST RECENTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE MITT ROMNEY WHO DESCRIBED HIM AS A CON MAN UNFIT FOR OFFICE THE BILLIONAIRE TOOK A MOMENT AT THE DEBATE TO HIT
DESCRIBED HIM AS A FIELD CANDIDATE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO EVERYBODY THE INSULTS CONTINUED HE SAID FLORIDA SENATOR MARKLE REPEAL WAS A LITTLE MAN AND HE REPEATED THAT HIS NEAREST RIVAL TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUISE WAS A LIAR
MISTER TRUMP FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS OF THE COLLAPSE OF HIS ONLINE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF A CIVIL LAWSUIT HE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE MANY POLICIES HE CHANGED HIS MIND ON AND YET AT THE END ALL THE CANDIDATES SAID THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE BUSINESSMAN IF HE WAS THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE A DISCOVERY WHICH THEY HOPE COULD LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE WAY SOME CANCERS ARE TREATED RESEARCHERS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HAVE IDENTIFIED PROTEINS ON THE SURFACE OF TUMOUR CELLS WHICH ALLOW THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO TARGET THE DISEASE THEY BELIEVE THAT BY ANALYSING THE D.N.A. WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THE SPOKE TREATMENTS BUT THE TECHNIQUE WOULD BE EXPENSIVE AND HAS NOT YET BEEN TRIED ON PATIENTS
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS ORDERED HIS MILITARY TO BE READY TO FIRE THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE ESTATE NEWS AGENCY IN PYONGYANG SAID HE WANTED HIS FORCES POISED TO LAUNCH A PRE EMPTY OF STRIKE FROM SOLD STEVE EVANS THE THREAT FROM KIM JONG ON COMES AS TENSION RATCHETS UP AFTER NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR TEST IN JANUARY AND RETALIATE TREE U.N. SANCTIONS THIS WEEK
ACCORDING TO THE KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY HE SAID AS HE INSPECTED ROCKET LAUNCHERS HIS MILITARY SHOULD BOLSTER ITS NUCLEAR FORCE BOTH IN QUALITY AND QUANTITY AND GET NUCLEAR WARHEADS ON STANDBY TO USE PRE EM TIVOLI
THIS KIND OF BLOODCURDLING RHETORIC IS NOT UNUSUAL AND OUTSIDE EXPERTS DOUBT THAT NORTH KOREA HAS YET GOT THE ABILITY TO MAKE A BOMB SMALL ENOUGH TO PUT ON A FEASIBLE MISSILE THOUGH IT DOES APPEAR TO BE MOVING STEADILY TOWARDS THAT GOAL
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEING WARNED ABOUT A LOOMING SHORTAGE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS MINISTER'S PLAN TO RESETTLE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ACROSS THE U.K. BUT THE COMMONS HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAYS MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE SUITABLE HOUSING
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK WILL HOLD TALKS WITH THE TURKISH LEADER TODAY TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR JOINT APPROACH TO THE MIGRANT CRISIS THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS ARE CONTINUING TO ARRIVE ON THE GREEK ISLANDS ALMOST EVERY DAY AFTER SETTING OFF FROM THE TURKISH COAST ARE EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORT FROM THE ISLAND OF LESBOS
THE EUROPEAN UNION DESPERATELY NEEDS A BREAKTHROUGH TO HELP IT REDUCE THE FLOW OF PEOPLE FROM TURKEY INTO THE GREEK ISLANDS DONALD TUSK IS NOW TALKING ABOUT A FAST AND LARGE SCALE MECHANISM TO SHIP BACK IRREGULAR MIGRANTS IN ORDER TO BREAK THEIR BUSINESS MODEL OF THE SMUGGLERS
BUT NEARLY HALF OF ALL ARRIVALS IN GREECE SO FAR THIS YEAR ARE REFUGEES FLEEING FROM THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA SO TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE ANY NEW POLICY WOULD HAVE TO GO WELL BEYOND A NARROW DEFINITION OF IRREGULAR ECONOMIC MIGRANTS
SEVERAL OF THE WORLD'S LEADING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE GONE TO COURT BACKING APPLE IN ITS BATTLE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THE F.B.I. WANTS APPLE TO HELP IT ACCESS ENCRYPTED IN ENCRYPTED DATA ON AND I PHONE WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN WHO SHOT DEAD FOURTEEN PEOPLE AT SAN BERNARDINO AND CALIFORNIA GOOGLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK AND AMAZON ARE AMONG FIRMS THAT ARE FILED A LEGAL BRIEF ALLOWING THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON THE CASE WHICH THEY SAID COULD AFFECT THEM
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX PHIL AVERY'S AT THE WEATHER'S EVERYBODY FILL JOHN VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU LESS OF THE DAY'S FORECAST WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES THE NORTH AND WEST MIDLANDS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND
CERTAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WE'VE HAD QUITE AN ACTIVE WEATHER FRONT OVERNIGHT WHICH IS DELIVERED AT THE LOWEST LEVELS RAIN BUT WITH NOT MUCH ELEVATION IT'S PRODUCED AN AWFUL LOT OF SNOW IS SEVERAL CENTIMETRES LYING FOR EXAMPLE AT LEEDS BRADFORD AIRPORT AT THE MOMENT A NUMBER OF ROADS ARE CLOSED THIS WEATHER FRONT WILL STICK ACROSS THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY MISERABLE FARE HERE AND REALLY QUITE COLD TOO
THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE FRONT WILL CLEAR OUT OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND TOO THEN SLUMP ITS WAY DOWN THROUGH WALES AND THE REMNANTS OF IT WILL PUSH INTO THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND ACROSS THE NORTH AND WEST MIDLANDS DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON AND ON INTO THE EARLY EVENING BY THIS STAGE I THINK THE SNOW WILL BE CONFINED TO THE VERY HIGHEST GROUND ONLY BUT WHILST IT'S AROUND ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND AND PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND JUST WATCH OUT FOR THOSE REALLY ADVERSE CONDITIONS THINGS WILL IMPROVE AND NORTHERN IRELAND LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON
ANY GOOD NEWS TO REPORT YES THE SOUTH AND EAST MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA THE SOUTH EAST LARGELY DRY NO ONCE THE LAST OF THE OVERNIGHT RAIN HAS CLEARED AWAY FROM THE VERY FAR EAST OF EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE TO THE PUSH THE TEMPERATURES TO ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DEGREES AND FOR SCOTLAND
OR NORTH OF THIS WEATHER FRONT THERE IS A STRONG NORTH EASTERLY WIND AND THAT'S GONNA RATTLE SHOWERS AGAIN A WINTRY MIX OF RAIN SLEET AND SNOW JUST DEPENDING ON ELEVATION IN ACROSS NORTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS FOR MOST OF THE DAY THE CENTRAL BELT THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND FARING A WEE BIT BETTER TOP TEMPERATURE ON THE DAY SEVEN WATCH OUT FOR THE SPARE THANKS PHILIP SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPER AND THE PAPER THE PAPERS AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE THE
NEWS ABOUT A POTENTIAL CURE FOR CANCER ON THE FRONT PAGES WITH ALL THE OBVIOUS HEDGING THAT COMES WITH THAT KIND OF HEADLINE BUT STILL IT IS QUITE A HEADLINE A CANCER CARE AND JUST ONE JAB QUESTION NOT HIS THEY HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL BRITISH SCIENTISTS ON THE BRINK OF BEING ABLE TO TREAT EVEN CARE CANCER WITH A SINGLE DOSE ESSAY BESPOKE THERAPIES ONE HUNT DOWN AND DESTROY
EVERY CANCER CELL WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE BODY THE TIMES HAS THE SAME HEADLINE EFFECTIVELY SCIENCE SCIENTISTS CLAIM CARE FOR CANCER IS CLOSER AND THEY SAY RESEARCH IS INVOLVED IN THE MEASURES BREAKTHROUGH WARNED THAT THEIR WORK WAS IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND TRIALS WERE NEEDED BEFORE IT COULD BE USED TO TREAT PATIENTS HOWEVER
QUITE AN EYE CATCHING QUOTE FROM CHARLES SWANTON WHO IS FROM THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON CANCER INSTITUTE WHO SAID I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IF WE HADN'T TREATED A PATIENT IN A TRIAL WITHIN TWO YEARS
THE TELEGRAPH LEADS OF THE STORY THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE BUT IT'S GIVING AT THE HEADLINE TREATMENT ON PAGE ONE IT SAYS MIDDLE CLASS SAVERS ARE TO LOSE THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OF TAX RELIEF WHEN SAVING FOR A PENSION BUT WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY TAX WHEN THEY RETIRE THESE ARE UNDER THIS IS THE RADICAL PLAN IT SAYS HE'S GOING TO BE UNVEILED IN THE BUDGET THE CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL WILL MEAN THAT HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS WILL LOSE VALUABLE TAX PERKS DURING THEIR WORKING LIVES BUT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW THEIR LIFETIME SAVINGS TAX FREE AFTER RETIREMENT
IN THE STANDARDS OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEMS IT'S CONSIDERED A PLODDING URGE ENDURED RATHER THAN LOVED LONG TIME SINCE ANYONE CHARGED INTO BATTLE WITH THEIR BLOOD UP UP HERE AND GOD SAVE THE QUEEN SAYS THE TIME'S ON ITS FRONT PAGE YET FOR ALL THAT LACKS IN POWER TO INSPIRE THE NATIONAL ANTHEMS PLACE AN ENGLISH SPORTING CULTURE LOOKED SAFER LAST NIGHT AFTER THE ORGANISATIONS THAT RUN BOTH ENGLAND RUGBY AND THE FOOTBALL TEAMS AS WELL CAME OUT
AGAINST MOVES TO DROP IT BOTH BODIES HAVE CLOSE LINKS TO THE ROYAL FAMILY OF COURSE THE TIME SAYS QUEEN PATRON OF THE RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION PRINCE HARRY THE VICE PATRON CENTRE CENTRE CENTRE THERE WAS THERE'S BEEN QUITE AN EFFORT TO PUSH ENGLAND TO GET ITS OWN ANTHEM JERUSALEM'S BEEN A CHOICE HASN'T IT BUT APPARENTLY THAT IS VERY VERY UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN AND THE TIME CELEBRATES THAT'S FACT
VERY LARGE PICTURE OF THE QUEEN ON THE FRONT PAGES VISITED THE SCHOOL THE DES SAYS WE'RE AT OUR HAPPIEST WHEN WE ARE WELL DEPENDS HOW YOU MEASURE IT REALLY WE HAVE THE BEST SEX AND FIND OUR SOUL MADE AT THE AGE OF THIRTY TWO WHERE MOST
BODLEY COMPEN THIRTY ONE AND SO ON I'D HAVE A CAREER AT THIRTY EIGHT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CALCULATIONS THAT'S BEEN DONE AS A NEW DAY GIVES IT A WHOLE PAGE WE WERE HER WEALTHIEST AT FORTY SEVEN AND SO ON AND TELL US ONE AT OUR MOST WHEN WE ARE AT OUR MOST MISERABLE NOW
IT'S WHATEVER THAT IS NOT TO MENTION THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL AS WELL BECAUSE HE'S GOT THIS GREAT HEADLINE CROSS THEM THEM BANNER ACROSS THE TOP IS THIS PROOF CHIMPS BELIEVE IN GOD WITH HER I HAVEN'T READ THE ARTICLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN IT BUT ANYWAY GOT TO GET IT ALL OF THE GREAT THING IS THERE'S A PICTURE OF A CHIMP WHO HAS GOT HIS HAND ON HIS HEAD AS IF HE'S TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER HE BELIEVES IN GOD OR NOT AS YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THROWING STONES AT TREES AND THINGS
IT IS ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TALK ABOUT ELECTRICITY WAS GOING TO FEATURE OF TODAY'S PROGRAMME BIG REPORT COMING OUT TODAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ASKED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND COME UP WITH BIG IDEAS ABOUT HOW IT CAN BE ALTERED USE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND THEY'RE TELLING US WE MISUSE ELECTRICITY DIFFERENTLY ROGER
A VIOLENT ANALYST HE'S ON THE LINE WHAT WHAT'S THE POINT OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TODAY RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS THEIR PROBLEM JUSTIN THE COMMISSION SAY THAT WE NEED AN ABSOLUTE REVOLUTION IN ENERGY WE'RE FACING MASSIVE PROBLEMS SO THE COAL POWER STATIONS ARE CLOSING WE'VE GOT A DE CARBONISE THE ECONOMY AND THAT THE WHOLE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THAT'S PROBLEM NUMBER ONE PROBLEM NUMBER TWO IS A LOT OF THE SAUCES THAT WILL BE COMING ON TO IT WILL BE INTERMITTENT SO THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW
WHEN WE WANTED HE BLOWS WHEN THE WIND BLOWS AND THEN THE THIRD BIG CHALLENGE WHICH I THINK MOST PEOPLE NOT QUITE GRASPED YET IS THE U.K. IS COMMITTED TO TAKING VIRTUALLY THE WHOLE OF HAKE HAD SYSTEM ALL OUR CARS CARS ON THE ROADS ON TWO ELECTRIC DURING THE TWENTIES THIRTIES AND THEN AFTER THEN HEATING ALL OUR HOMES WITH ELECTRICITY TO SO NOT ONLY IS THERE MORE INTERMITTENT DEMAND BUT THAT DEMAND WILL BE EVEN GREATER THAN IT HAS BEEN BEFORE PUTTING ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE GRID AND THE SOLUTION
THE SOLUTION THEY SAY WE HAVE TO REALLY REVOLUTIONISED THINGS SAYS THIS WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT FLEXIBILITY ON THE GRID AND WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT STORAGE SO STORAGE IS KIND OF OBVIOUS WE BUILT BATTERIES AND WE BUILD ALL SORTS OF OTHER DEVICES MAY BE STORING ENERGY IN IN LIQUID AIR OR PERHAPS IN COMPRESSED AIR THERE'S ALL SORTS OF IDEAS SOME OF THEM WHICH WE'VE FEATURED ON THE PROGRAMME ALREADY BUT I THINK THE THING THAT WILL REALLY INTEREST PEOPLE
IS THEY ENVISAGE A REALLY ENTIRELY NEW SYSTEM IN WHICH YOUR FRIDGE AND YOUR FREEZER YOUR WASHING MACHINE YOUR DISHWASHER YOUR CAR BATTERY WILL IN SOME WAY VIA AN INTERNET OF ENERGY BE LINKS TO ALL MY GADGETS SOME SOLAR PANELS ON MY ROOF IF I HAD WON MY WINDFARM IF I HAD ONE A NUCLEAR POWER STATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL BE LINKED TOGETHER
AND IN ORDER THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN IN ORDER TO LET US USE ELECTRICITY MORE FLEXIBLY SO WHEN POWER IS CHEAP YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TURN ON YOUR WASHING MACHINE EFFECT IT WILL TURN ON ITSELF AND THEN WHEN POWER IS SCARCE AND THE INTERNET WILL ASK YOUR FREEZER JUSTIN'S FREEZER DO YOU MIND IF WE TURN YOU OFF FOR HALF AN HOUR SO MISSUS BLOGGS NEXTDOOR COULD PUT ON THE SUPPER AND YOUR FREEZER WILL SAY YES AND THIS IS THIS IS THE FUTURE THEY ENVISAGE
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG WELL ROGER EVENT THANKS WE'LL TALK TO LORD ADONIS THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION INTO HER HOUSE
THE COURSE OF FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW THE TALK OF A SECOND REFERENDUM IS GROWING AS SECOND REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND THAT IS ON INDEPENDENCE IF MOST OF BRITAIN BOATS TO LEAVE EUROPE WITH THE SCOTS VOTE TO STAY IN SO IT'S SET OUT SMITH IS SCOTLAND EDITOR SARAH GOOD MORNING TELL MOST OF SCOTLAND WILL VOTE TO STAY IN
OPINION POLLS AT THE MOMENT SAY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF SCOTS INTEND TO VOTE TO STAY IN THAT'S NARROWING VERY SLIGHTLY BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT YOU WOULD GET TO A POINT WHERE SCOTS WERE GOING TO BOUGHT BY MAJORITY TO LEAVE ALTHOUGH IT IS REALLY INTERESTING IF YOU BURY INTO THE DATA
SCOTT SEEMED TO BE JUST ABOUT AS SCEPTICAL AS THE REST OF THE UNITED KINGDOM SIXTY PERCENT SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THE E.U. TO HAVE FEWER POWERS THAT COMPRESS THE SIXTY FIVE PER CENT ACROSS THE U.K. SO THAT LEVEL OF SCEPTICISM IS THERE IT JUST DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO PEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE TO LEAVE RIGHT IF THAT THIS HAPPENS IF IT HAPPENS THAT ENGLAND WALES WHEREVER WROTE TOO
YOU COME OUT THEN WHAT THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON HAS SAID THAT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY CALLS A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE SHE HAS BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN OUT OF THE E.U. AGAINST HIS WILL OF SCOTS VOTE TO STAY AND SHE THINKS THAT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD CREATE SUCH A CLAMOUR FOR A VAULT FOR ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM THAT SHE SAID SHE'D BE UNABLE TO REFUSE IT AND THAT WE WILL GO FOR THAT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PULLING ON THIS IT'S A BLOW BUT HARD TO LOOK THAT FAR INTO THE FUTURE BUT IF YOU ASK PEOPLE RIGHT NOW IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES HOW WOULD YOU VOTE A MAJORITY SAY THEY WOULD VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE BUT ONLY ABOUT FIFTY TWO PERCENT AND NICOLA STURGEON'S ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR SHE'S NOT GOING TO CALL ANOTHER REFERENDUM UNTIL THE PULLING HAS BEEN AS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT PRO INDEPENDENCE FOR SOME SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME WELL THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT FOR SURE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THANKS SARAH
THE TIME QUARTER PAST SIX NEW REPORTS SUGGEST WE COULD SAVE A LOT OF CASH ALL OF US THROUGH THE MORE INTELLIGENT USE OF POWER THAT'S WHAT ROGER HARBIN WAS TELLING US A FEW MOMENTS AGO AND HE WAS COMING UP WITH EXAMPLES OF HOW WE MIGHT DO IT TANYA ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AT THE END HE'S SHE WOULD SHE'S HERE NOW BECAUSE I'VE GOT A FREEZER CARRY ON WITH ATTITUDE THAT WOULD SAY NO I THINK YOU CANNOT COOK YOUR SUPPER
O.K. SO U.K. CONSUMERS COULD SAY THIS IS WHAT THE REPORT SAYS EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR BY TWENTY THIRTY IN THIS IF WE EMBARK ON A SMART POWER REVOLUTION AND THIS IS THE VERDICT OF A NEW REPORTED YOU SAID FROM THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSIONER COMES OUT THIS MORNING AND IT'S THE FIRST OF THREE REPORTS LOOKING AT BIG
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES SMART PARA ENCOMPASSES THREE INNOVATIONS INTERCONNECTION STORAGE AND DEMAND FLEXIBILITY WHICH IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT TO EXPLAIN AND UNPICK WHAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE SAVING I'M JOINED NOW IT DOWN THE LINE FROM BRIGHTON BY JIM WATSON WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE U.K. ENERGY RESEARCH CENTRE SO JIM WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SMART POWER WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE TRYING TO MATCH SUPPLY AND DEMAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCURATELY AS THAT
WE MATCH SUPPLY AND DEMAND ACCURATELY RIGHT NOW AND HAVE DONE EVER SINCE THE PAST IT'S JUST THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SUPPLY ALL THE CAPACITY TO SUPPLY IS GOING TO BE SHRINKING EH YES IT'S THAT AS WELL BUT WE'RE KIND OF THE REPORTS REALLY CALLING UP FOR US TO MOVE AWAY FROM A NINETEEN SIXTY SYSTEM WHERE WE ASSUME THAT PEOPLE DEMAND ELECTRICITY AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND THE WAY WE MANAGE THE SYSTEM IS BY BUILDING A LOAD OF BIG POWER STATIONS
TO BE ON STAND BY TO MEET THAT DEMAND NOW WE'RE AS ROGER WAS DESCRIBING WE BRING IN THE DEMAND SIDE STORAGE CONNECTIONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEIR REPORTS MAIN CONTENTION IS DOING IT WITH MORE OF THAT AS WELL AS THE LARGE POWER STATIONS MEANS THAT WE CAN RUN THE SYSTEM CHEAPER AND MORE FLEXIBLY AS THE SYSTEM CHANGES AND BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED RIGHT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IN THE CASE OF SOLAR POWER AND ALSO WIND ENERGY AND FOR THAT MATTER NUCLEAR ENERGY THE ABILITY TO
ALTAR SUPPLIES TO MATCH DE MA JUST ISN'T THERE IT'S THE SUNSHINE'S WHEN THE SUNSHINE'S DOESN'T IT A DUD SO TO THAT EXTENT SOME OF THE NEW SOURCES ARE INTERMITTENT SOME OF THEM AREN'T SO NEUTER ISN'T BUT IT'S BUT IT YOU CAN'T LITERALLY MY FLEXIBLE IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND WE NEED A LODGER POWER STATIONS AS WELL SO THE IDEA IS TO UNLOCK THE DEMAND SIDE WHICH AT THE MOMENT DOESN'T PLAY A VERY BIG ROLE THAT REQUIRES CHANGES IN INCENTIVES
IT'S ALWAYS SO REQUIRES OF COURSE IF WE'RE DOING IN PEOPLE'S HOMES WITH THEIR FREEZER THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE THAT THIS IS WHAT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO ALLOW AND ALSO REQUIRES THE INTERNET OF THINGS TO WORK AND THAT IS AN INTERNET THAT CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE RIGHT YEAH I MEAN THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS IDEA IS SOMEHOW THAT IT BE AUTOMATIC THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT YOUR FRIDGE FREEZER OR TURNED OFF FOR HALF AN HOUR COS ACTUALLY OR YOU'RE COLD FRUIT STILL COLD OR FROZEN BUT OTHER TIMES OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT WANT CHOICE SO THEY MIGHT JUST WANT INFORMATION ABOUT PRICES AND SAYING
ACTUALLY I CAN MAKE A BIT OF MONEY NOW SO I'LL DO SOMETHING SO THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT MODELS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE REPORT US FOR HIS TRIALLING SOME OF THESE MODELS THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE WHAT WORKS WHAT WORKS THE PEOPLE AND WHAT WORKS FOR BUSINESSES AND WHAT ABOUT BATTERIES HOW ADVANCED ARE THEY IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO STORE POWER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DURING POWER IN OUR INDIVIDUAL HOMES OR ELSEWHERE AND ALSO OF COURSE AS WE KNOW THE PROBLEM WITH BATTERIES IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU CHARGE IT UP AND THEN DISCHARGE AT YOU LIZ OFF THE ENERGY
YOU DO ANY BATTERY TECHNOLOGY HAS COME ALONG A LONG WAY BUT STORAGE COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT GUISES SO IT CAN BE SMALL IT CAN BE SMALLER SITTING IN A MOBILE PHONE SORRY ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE BROUGHT ON THAT TECHNOLOGY QUICKLY BUT IT COULD BE VERY LARGE SITTING ON A GREAT VERY LARGE KIND OF FACILITY AND WE ALSO ONE OF THE BIGGER CHALLENGES ACTUALLY STORING HEAT AS WE USE A LOT MORE HEAT IN THE WINTER WHEN DO DOING THERE
AND THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE BIGGER THAN FOR ELECTRICITY SO THE TECHNOLOGY'S MOVED ON IT'S COMING DOWN IN COST AS THE REPORT SAID SOME OF THE BARRIERS ARE TO DO WITH REGULATION BECAUSE STORAGE ISN'T DEMAND AND IT ISN'T A POWER STATION TO SOMEHOW IT FALLS BETWEEN THE CRACKS OF REGULATIONS AND THAT AND THAT CHANGE A SPLITTING OF REGULATION IN THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE IN THE THE GOVERNMENT WAS CRITICISED YESTERDAY FOR REVERSING OR CHANGING COURSE ON ENERGY POLICY I'M ASSUMING THAT'S NOT HELPFUL
IT CERTAINLY ISN'T HELPFUL I THINK REPORT YESTERDAY POINTED OUT QUITE RIGHTLY THAT INVESTORS OF ALL KINDS HAVE BEEN SPOOKED EVEN THOSE WHO ARE STILL IN RELATIVELY GOOD ODOUR WITH THE GOVERNMENT JUST BECAUSE OF THESE CHANGES WITHOUT MUCH WARNING SO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS TO BE RIGHT ON ONE THING THE REPORT CALLS FOR WHICH I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IS THAT WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BALANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND AT THOSE PEAK TIMES IN WINTER THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE AS EQUALLY AS THE SUPPLY SIDE SO DEMAND FLEXIBILITY
AS WELL AS BUILDING NEW POWER STATIONS ARE NEW INTO CONNECTORS AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS JIM WATSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO THE MARKETS WHICH JOB I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THIS WEEK I'VE BEEN IN DECIDEDLY BETTER FORM CHRIS RALPH IS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT MONEY MANAGER AT SAINT JAMES'S PLACE HE CAN TELL US WHY
WELL I THINK WHAT MARKETS HAVE CALMED DOWN THAT WE CERTAINLY HAD A VERY DIFFICULT START TO THE YEAR WHEN MARKETS WERE UNSETTLED AND WE SAW SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN IN THE MARKET SINCE NEWS CAME OUT OF CHINA THAT THE ECONOMY'S THE ECONOMY SEEM TO BE SLOWING FURTHER THERE WAS WORRIES IN THE EUROZONE AND WORRIES OUT OF OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AS TO WHICH WAY INTEREST RATES WOULD BE MOVING NEXT AND I THINK MARKETS ARE ANNE
IN A CALMER PHASE BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAYING THAT THERE WON'T BE VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD TURN NO AND THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED WAS A LITTLE BIT UPSET BY SOME DISAPPOINTING NEWS FROM THE SERVICES SECTOR YESTERDAY WELL THE THE LATEST AND THERE WAS A REPORT YESTERDAY SAYING THAT IT'S BEEN A WEEK OF BAD NEWS FOR FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE ACTUAL FIGURE FOR THE PERCHING MANAGES INDEX FOR THE SERVICES SECTOR IT WASN'T SAYING THAT WAS A CONTRACTION IT WAS JUST A A FALL IN THAT NUMBER AND YES THERE'S BEEN SIMILAR
SLIGHTLY WORSE DATA FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTOR AND THAT MEANS THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU KATIE P. WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER OR THE FORECAST YOU CAN JUDY PEE IN THE FIRST CHORD WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN BUT YET WE'RE AN ECONOMY THAT THAT HAS VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT WE'VE OBVIOUSLY SEEN STERLING FALLERS AS A RESULT OF THE OF THE DEBATE OVER PROTECTS IT THAT'S GOT TO BE GOOD FOR FOR FOR U.K. COMPANIES
LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS STATESIDE FOR A MOMENT THE MARKET SEEM TO BE IGNORING THE PRESIDENTIAL THE PRIMARIES ARE AT THE MOMENT AT WHAT POINT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ENGAGE WITH IT AT THE MOMENT WE'RE STILL IN THIS IN THIS PERIOD WHEN IT IS NOT FUN TO BE TO SERVE DETERMINED HOODY HOODY THE NOMINATIONS FOR THE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WILL BE ALTHOUGH IT IT'S LOOKING INCREASINGLY LIKELY WE KNOW WHAT THAT WHAT THAT WILL BE
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WANT TO REMEMBER IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THERE WERE BALANCES HERE SO A PRESIDENT HASN'T GOT THE ULTIMATE POWER YOU'VE GOT TO WORK WITH CONGRESS HE'S GOT TO WORK WITH THE SENATE SO WE CAN'T EQUATE IT TO A GENERAL ELECTION IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SITUATION IN THE U.K. EVEN WITH SOME OF THE THE MORE EXTREMIST NOISES THAT ARE COMING OUT
FROM SOME OF THE CANDIDATES IS THERE WILL BE BALANCING THEM IMPACT THERE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE JOBS FIGURES FROM THE U.S. THIS AFTERNOON YES THE LATEST SERIES OF NON FARM PAYROLLS FOM FOM THE UNITED STATES WE'RE STILL EXPECTING SEE JOB CREATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT'S LIKELY TO FOOL NOT TO NOT FAR SHORT OF FOUR PERCENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE WHAT'S INTERESTING THOUGH IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT EARNING STATE OR IN THE U.S. WHILST THERE WAS AND ACTUALLY MUCH
GROSS IN IN EARNINGS IN THE LARGER COMPANIES ACTUALLY THE SMALLER COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ON CAN I JUST VERY BRIEFLY ASK YOU ABOUT B. H. S. TALKING ABOUT CLOSING A DRAMATIC NUMBER OF ITS STORES UNLESS THE RENT GOES DOWN WHAT'S THE STORY THE STORY HERE IS THAT IS THAT B.H.S. WHICH WAS BOUGHT BY A CONSORTIUM FOR FOR A POUND FROM SOME SEVILLA GREEN A WEE WHILE BACK AND
IT'S NOW FOUND THAT TRADING IS REALLY TOUGH IT'S FOUND THAT RENTS ARE TOO HIGH AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A DOES TO THE COST OF EMPLOYING STAFF AND THAT'S AND THAT'S MORE CHALLENGING SO
AND PEOPLE ARE BUYING MORE GOODS ON THE INTERNET SO IT'S A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR B.H.S.

BRITISH SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY'VE DEVELOPED A WAY TO STEER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL CANCERS RESEARCHERS FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON THINK THEY FOUND A WAY TO TARGET UNIQUE MARKINGS WITHIN A TUMOUR BUT THE APPROACH WOULD BE EXPENSIVE POSSIBLY REQUIRING BESPOKE VACCINES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND HAS NOT YET BEEN TRIED IN PATIENTS
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS SAID HIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE READY TO USE ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ANY TIME STATE MEDIA ALSO SAYS HE'S ORDERED THE MILITARY TO ADOPT A POSTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR A PRE EMPTY OF STRIKE HIS REMARKS COME AFTER NEW UNITED NATION SANCTIONS WERE IMPOSED ANALYSTS DOUBT THAT PYONGYANG HAS MADE A NUCLEAR WEAPON SMALL ENOUGH TO BE CARRIED BY A ROCKET
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN WARNED ABOUT A LOOMING DIT SHORTAGE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS MINISTER'S PLAN TO RESETTLE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ACROSS THE U.K. BUT THE COMMONS HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAYS MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE SUITABLE HOUSING
THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS FACING CAUSED TO ADOPT MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING TO ENCOURAGE FORMER TEACHERS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM IN ENGLAND THE RESEARCH GROUP POLICY EXCHANGE SAYS MANY WOMEN WHO LEAVE TEACHING TO BRING UP CHILDREN COULD BE ATTRACTED BACK BY LESS RIGID WORK PATTERNS
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAID THE WAY THE REFERENDUM OF EGGS BEING CONDUCTED HAD CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT CHRIS MOSTYN'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT SOME REALLY STRONG LANGUAGE CHRIS CERTAINLY IS THE GIST OF HIS ARGUMENTS JOHN IS THAT HE SAYS THAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THE PRIME MINISTER GOT HIS AT DEAL IN BRUSSELS THE ARGUMENT BEING MADE THEN WAS ALL ABOUT WHAT VOTE ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT SAW AS THE BENEFITS OF THAT DEAL AND YET THEY'VE DITCHED THAT LINE OF ARGUMENT
SO HE GOES HIS CASE AND INSTEAD I COMING OUT WITH ALL OF THIS PROJECT'S FIERCE STUFF TO ADOPT THE SHORTHAND WHICH THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN YOU SO THEY TALK ABOUT THE HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE DOSSIERS THREATENING ALMOST BIBLICAL CONSEQUENCES IF WE DARE TO CONSIDER HER FUTURE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THOSE THE WORDS FROM
MISTER DUNCAN SMITH IN THIS ARTICLE TALKED AS YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE ACRIMONIOUS MANNER IN WHICH ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD HAPPEN I HAVE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REFERENDUM AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS HE ALSO MAKES THE POINT THAT IF IT WAS SO PERILOUS
THE IDEA OF LEAVING WHY ON EARTH WOULD THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW SAYING THAT HAVE OFFERED TO THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE WELL INDEED BUT THE IMPORTANT THING I SUPPOSE IS WHETHER THAT ALL THIS STUFF
ONCE THE REFERENDUM HAS BEEN HELD WHICH OTHER WAY GOES ALL THIS STUFF WILL BE FORGOTTEN THEY WILL ALL GET TOGETHER AGAIN IN CABINET AND SAY EVERYTHING'S HUNKY DORY NOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER TO WONDER WHETHER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT QUITE AND THE FACT THAT MY SMITH IS RAISING THE PROSPECT THAT THAT MIGHT BE QUITE DIFFICULT IS QUITE TELLING I THINK BECAUSE DOWNING STREET IS VERY VERY CONSCIOUS THAT
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS REFERENDUM IN IN LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS' TIME THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS TO CARRY ON GOVERNING WHAT IS GUARANTEED IS THAT A HUGE CHUNK OF THAT PARTY WILL BE ON THE LOSING SIDE OF THE ARGUMENTS WILL BE FEELING VERY SORE
AND VERY WOUNDED BECAUSE FOR MANY OF THEM ON BOTH SIDES IT'S BEEN A LIFE LONG ARGUMENT THAT THEY'VE WANTED TO MAKE AND THE FEAR AND MY HE'S WITH HIS CLEARLY WOUNDED BY SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN USED SO FAR IS THAT THIS GOES BEYOND A POLITICAL ARGUMENT AND STARTS GETTING VERY PERSONAL AND SO THE FACT THAT MY SMITH HE'S FELT THE NEED TO
TO MENTION WHAT HE FEARS COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS KIND OF STYLE OF CAMPAIGNING AS HE SEES IT PLAYS RIGHT INTO HER TO SAY THAT THE FEAR THAT THOSE IN DOWNING STREET AND ELSEWHERE BUT AFTERWARDS THEY'VE GOT
DUST THEMSELVES DOWN CARRY ON PUT ALL OF THIS BEHIND THEM WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE PARLIAMENT STILL TO COME I WAS TALKING TO A MINISTER OF THE DAY YOU SAID HE WAS REALLY SURPRISED AS A MINISTER ON THE INSIDE THERE REMAIN SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT HE WAS GOING DOWN AN ESCALATOR IN PARLIAMENT HE SAID HELLO ON FIRST NAME TERMS WITH AN OUTER SOMEONE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE AND HE WAS BLANKED THEY SAID THAT'S THE FEAR THAT IS THE FEAR THAT THIS IS SUCH A DEEP SEATED DEVICE
THEN YOU DECIDE OF THE TWENTY THIRD COULD BE PRETTY TRICKY CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT I'M TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN CAN DONALD TRUMP IS STOPPED ALICE THE QUESTION OBSESSING AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE AT THE MOMENT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES LITTLE BIT WHITTLED DOWN NOW BUT THOSE CANDIDATES STILL IN THE RACE HELD YET ANOTHER
T.V. DEBATE LAST NIGHT FOX NEWS WERE THE HOSTS AND DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED DURING THAT DEBATE TO CRITICISMS LEVELLED AT HIM BEFORE THE DEBATE BY THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY
LOOK HE WAS A FAILED CANDIDATE HE SHOULD'VE BEATEN PRESIDENT OBAMA VERY
AND IT WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHAT A WAY TO LOOK LIKE YOU WERE AWAY ON A VACATION THE LAST MONTH SO I DON'T TAKE DAD AND I GUESS OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS TO BE RELEVANT DO WANTS TO BE BACK IN THE GAME AS FAR AS DOMESTIC POLICY AND TRADE WHICH IS KILLING OUR COUNTRY HE SAID FREE TRADE AND I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA AND IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN AND IF YOU LOOK AT MEXICO BOTH AT THE BORDER BY THE WAY WITH A KILLING US BOTH AT THE BORDER AND WITH TRADE AND EVERY OTHER COUNTRY WE DO BUSINESS WITH WE ARE GETTING ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED ON TRADE
DONALD DID COME UNDER SOME PRESSURE THOUGH OVER ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HIS TRUMP UNIVERSITY THIS IS AN ONLINE EDUCATION COMPANY IT'S CLOSED NOW BUT IT'S BEEN THE FOCUS OF LEGAL ACTION FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY PAID MONEY BUT THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH IN RETURN REFERRING TO TRUMP UNIVERSITY SENATOR MARCO RUBIO QUESTION WHETHER THE VOTERS COULD TRUST WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID HE'S TRYING TO DO WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER WHAT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP FOR THIS
I DON'T WANT IT HE GOT IT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT'S A COUNTRY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN A GENERATION AND HE'S TRYING TO CON PEOPLE INTO GIVING THEM THE ROAD JUST LIKE HE CONNED THESE PEOPLE INTO GIVING HIM NO LET ME TELL YOU
EXCUSE ME THE REAL CAR AN ARTIST IS CERTAIN MARCO RUBIO WELL THAT WAS DONE I WAS TEN THAT'S HER TED CREWS ALSO HAD A GO HE'S STILL IN THE RACE HE CRITICISE TRUMPER IS PATCHY RECORD OF SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS SOMETHING AGAIN MISTER TRUMP DISMISSED ANU ALSO CRITICISED HIM FOR HIS PAR SUPPORT FOR HILLARY CLINTON
THE CHOICE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS ARE MAKING US WHO IS BEST PREPARED TO STAND UP TO HILLARY CLINTON AND BEAT HILLARY CLINTON DONALD TRUMP HAS WRITTEN CHEQUES TO HILLARY CLINTON NOT ONCE NOT TWICE NOT THREE TIMES TEN TIMES AND FOUR OF THOSE CHECKS
WE'RE NOT TO A SENATE CAMPAIGN IT WASN'T THAT SHE WAS THE NEW YORK IT WAS A CAST OF DOING BUSINESS IT WAS TO A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN DONALD TRUMP IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WROTE FOR CHEQUES TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS PRESIDENT I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO ASK WHY DID YOU WRITE CHEQUES TO HILLARY CLINTON TO BE PRESIDENT IN TWO THOUSAND IT WASN'T FOR HER BUSINESS AND HOW CAN YOU STAND ON THE DEBATE STAGE NOW WITH HER AND SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY OR WAS THAT
IT GOES ON YET ANOTHER DEBATE I THINK WE'VE GOT A FEW STILL TO GO THOSE CANDIDATE STILL END ICE ENLIGHTENING
THEIR TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS MANY FRONT PAGES FEATURE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY SCIENTISTS THAT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED AN ACHILLES HEEL OF CANCER WHICH COULD LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE SCIENTISTS CLAIM THAT CURE FOR CANCER IS CLOSER
THAT'S WHAT THE TIMES HEADLINE SAYS A CANCER CURE IN JUST ONE JAB THE QUESTION MARK IS WHAT THE MAIL SAYS THE TIMES REPORTS THAT RESEARCHERS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOPE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HARNESS THE BODY'S OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ATTACK TUMOURS GUARDIAN SAYS THE LANDMARK DISCOVERY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO OPEN A NEW FRONT IN THE WAR ON CANCER AND DELIVER POTENT THERAPIES TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS RESEARCHERS ARE QUOTED AS SAYING THEY WANT TO BEGIN THE FIRST HUMAN TRIALS IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS

PENSION FUNDS TO SEE IN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS HE'S BEEN TOLD THE CHANGES CAN BE RESTRICTED TO YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE JOBS MARKET FOR THE FIRST TIME IT ALSO SAYS MISTER OSBORNE WILL RELUCTANTLY DROPPED PLANS TO INTRODUCE A FLAT RATE OF TAX RELIEF ON PENSIONS IN THIS MONTH'S BUDGET IN THE FACE IN THE TORY BACKLASH CASE OF JASON LAWRENCE WHO'S BEEN GIVEN A LIFE SENTENCE FOR RAPING FIVE WOMEN HE MET THROUGH AN INTERNET DATING SERVICES WIDELY REPORTED
STOP ONLINE DATING PREDATORS THAT IS THE MIRROR'S FRONT PAGE HEADLINE HE QUOTES A JUDGE AT DERBY CROWN COURT HE SUGGESTED SUCH WEBSITE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY REFER REPORTS OF VIOLENCE TO THE POLICE BUT A SOURCE AT THE WEBSITE MATCH DOT COM TOLD THE INDEPENDENT IT WAS NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO PASS ON INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL RAPISTS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BREACH THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE PERSON MAKING THE COMPLAINT AND LEAVE THEM OPEN TO BEING SUED FOR DEFAMATION
IT WAS HIS NEW LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE JUDGES' CONCERNS AND MADONNA IS PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS SINGER IS ATTEMPTING TO USE CHILD ABDUCTION LAWS TO FORCE HER FORMER HUSBAND GUY RITCHIE TO RETURN THERE SOME ROCKET IN NEW YORK THAT TEENAGERS CURRENTLY LIVING WITH HIS FATHER IN LONDON UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LABEL THE SUN SAYS THE FEUDING CARPEL
OR CLOSE TO A CUSTODY DEAL THAT WOULD ALLOW A ROCKET OR LIVE IN THE U.K. AS LONG AS HE GETS BACK TO THE U.S. REGULARLY FOR HOLIDAY SO THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO SELL ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING IS THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH ATTACKING THOSE PEOPLE ARE CAMPAIGNING TO KEEP BRITAIN IN YOUR OPINION HE WAS THERE SMEARS AND THREATS COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE REFERENDUM
DISTURBING EVIDENCE ABOUT GANGS AND YOUTH VIOLENCE WAS HEARD IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY ONE M. P. SPOKE ABOUT A STABBING IN THE STREET ROUND THE CORNER FROM HER HOME THERE WERE TALES OF DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS IN THE SPREAD OF VIOLENCE FROM THE INNER CITIES TO THE SUBURBS AND BEYOND THE PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
FOR MOST PEOPLE BRITIAN STREETS CAN FEEL PRETTY SAFE BUT FOR OTHERS IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD A COMMONS DEBATE YESTERDAY OPENED A WINDOW FROM THAT SAFE WORLD INTO THE OTHER ONE I WAS DRIVING HOME AND TO
I SAW THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN COLD UPON THE PAVEMENT AROUND THE CORNER FROM MY HOME LABOUR'S LYNN BROWNED
SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS WERE WITH HIM AND I COULD HEAR THE SIRENS OF AMBULANCES THAT WERE ON THEIR WAY
THAT YOUNG MAN WAS THE VICTIM OF THE STABBING AND HE WAS CLUTCHING A STOMACH WOUND BUT THANKFULLY THAT PROVED NOT TO BE FATAL
INCIDENT SHOOK ME TO THE VERY POOR IT WAS SO SO CLOSE TO MY HOUSE AND IT WASN'T EVEN REALLY LATE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT
LYNN BROWN A SHADOW HOME OFFICE MINISTER AND LONDON M. P. SPEAKING IN A DEBATE ON GANGS AND USE VIOLENCE IT WAS LED BY LABOUR'S TOOK AT THE MONA WHO POINTED TO AN INCREASE IN THE CAPITAL OF VIOLENT OFFENCES BY YOUNG PEOPLE LINKED TO GANGS IN JUST THE PAST FORTNIGHT THEY'VE BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF INCIDENTS IN HIS AREA OF SOUTH LONDON ON THE FRIDAY GUNSHOTS ON THE SATURDAY A MULTIPLE STABBING
ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THAT SATURDAY THERE WAS A DRIVE BY SHOOTING ON MONDAY THIS WEEK AT FIVE THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON
A TEENAGER WAS STABBED IN THE NORTH OF MY BOROUGH IN OVAL AFTER A FIGHT AT A CHICKEN CHOP AND SO IT GOES ON BUT DID ANYONE MUCH NOTICE OR CARE IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PREDOMINANTLY MIDDLE CLASS CHILDREN
COMFORTABLE MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES FROM WEALTHY NEIGHBOURHOODS THIS ISSUE WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER UP THE NATIONAL
LOOK AT THE MOON OR SIGHTED A WHOLE RANGE OF CAUSES FROM VIOLENT POPULAR CULTURE TO BOREDOM AND A NEED TO HELP OUT WITH HOUSEHOLD BILLS ARE CONSERVATIVE WITH A SOUTH LONDON CONSTITUENCY BOB STEWART THOUGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER CAUSE FEAR IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PERSON
LIVING ON AN ESTATE IN AN AREA WHERE THESE GROUPS OPERATE AND YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF THAT GROUP
YOU WILL BE VERY FIERCE
THAT THIS GROUP WAS SET UPON YOU AND DO YOU GREAT DAMAGE AND OTHER LABOUR M.P. DAVID LANNY SAID THAT THREE YEARS AGO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT THE INNER CITIES OF LONDON LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER BUT NOW THE PROBLEM WAS SPREADING TO THE SUBURBS AND BEYOND LAST YEAR WE HOW BASILDON
HIGH WYCOMBE SOUTHAMPTON SWINDON AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SOME IN THE WARS
WAS IN A CITY HAS NOW BECOME INCREDIBLY SIMPLE
THERE'S THAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY BLAH HAD BEEN
ACTUALLY IT'S THE WHOLE REFLECTION OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP WITH THIS VIOLENCE THE PITCHER IS NOT UNIQUE TO PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES IT'S
AND LABOUR'S AND COFFEE EXPLAINED HER SOME OF THAT COULD BE HAPPENING THROUGH THE PHENOMENON OF COUNTY LINES WERE URBAN GANGS GROOMED VULNERABLE YOUNGSTERS TO TRANSPORT AND SELL HARD DRUGS FURTHER AFIELD
CHILDREN ARE USED TO REDUCE THE RISK TO OLDER GANG
THEY MAKE A ONE OFF JUST BY POLICE PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF A FAIR
THE GANGLING LEADERS I RATHER LIKE MODERN DAY FEED HIMSELF PILLS
HARD MEN WHOM YOUNGSTERS AND THEN USE THEM TO DO THEIR DIRTY WORK
AND THAT CHIMED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF A CONSERVATIVE WILL QUINCE THE M.P. FOR COLCHESTER IN ESSEX THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF MURDERS OFTEN EVOLVING STABBINGS WHEN EITHER THE VICTIM NOR THOSE ARRESTED AND IN SOME CASES THOSE CONVICTED OF THE OFFENCES LIVE IN ESSEX
THE LONDON GANGS ARE WITHOUT DOUBT OPERATING THEIR COUNTY LINES INTO ESSEX
VIOLENT GANG MEMBERS HAVE BEEN USING INTIMIDATION AND VIOLENCE OFTEN AGAINST VULNERABLE PEOPLE TO TAKE OVER PROPERTIES IN TOWNS SUCH AS SOUTHEND AND BASILDON BUT EVEN AS FAR NORTH AS COLCHESTER TO SUPPLY DRUGS TO LOCAL DEALERS
DAVID LIMEY HAD CALLED THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY EIGHT PAGES OF ANODYNE STATEMENTS THE HOME OFFICE MINISTER KAREN BRADLEY ADMITTED THAT BY THE TIME YOUNG PEOPLE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IT WAS OFTEN TOO LATE
IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC LOOK WE ONLY FINDING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT PUT YOUNG PERSON THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GET AT THAT TEACHABLE MOMENT WITH THAT YOUNG PERSON IS WHEN THEY TURN UP AND NOT FROM AN AMBULANCE BECAUSE THE GANGS ARE NOT PHONING THE AMBULANCE IS THERE NOT FENN BLUE LIGHT THEY'RE TURNING UP IN PRIVATE CARS BEING DUMPED
AND THAT IS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE AS ANY AGENCY TO GET HIM TO CONTACT THEM KEEP THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND OH SHE WASN'T KEEN ON THE IDEA OF A CROSS PARTY COMMISSION SHE SAID SHE WAS WILLING TO TALK TO ANY M.P.S ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM
THAT WAS SUE'S IN REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT MORE JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE THE CHINESE NO THIRTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING THE WAY WE LEARN ABOUT OUR PAST CROWD FUNDING AND CROWD SOURCING MAKING THEIR MARK IN THE FIELD OF ARCHAEOLOGY THEY HAVE IN SO MANY OTHER FEELS DOCTOR SARAH PAS CHECKERS
PIONEERING SPACE ARCHAEOLOGIST WHO USES SATELLITE IMAGERY TO DISCOVER ANCIENT SITES AND MATT LOOTING AS WELL SHE WON THIS YEAR'S PRESTIGIOUS TED PRIZE THAT'S THAT ONLINE LECTURE SERIES AMBER SHE'S BEEN TELLING ME HOW HER PROJECT IS GOING TO WORK
PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO SIGN UP USERS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT KINDS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES ARE IN THAT COUNTRY AND BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A RATHER HOW THEY LOOK FREUND STACE YOUR IDEAS TO ENGAGE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TO TURN THEM ALL UNDER SPACE THIRTY ARTISTS BUT HOW MUCH EXPERTISE DO THEY NEED TO HAVE
TRULY IT NOTHING MORE THAN THE TUTORIAL THERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF EXAMPLES OFF TO THE SIDE UP THEY'LL NEVER BE KIND OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING GOING IS THAT WHAT IS THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU ASKED THE SIDE THEY'LL HAVE EXAMPLES OF PINNING ALL REALLY ARE ED'S TUNES TEMPLES WHEREVER STRUCTURES ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR CULTURE AND THE CULTURE IS THAT THAT AREA
DOES YOUR WORK EVER LEAD TO ACTUAL DIGGING BEING DONE
OH YES YES ON MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN GOING INTO THE FIELDS FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO CONFIRM AND FEATURES THAT WE FOUND FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE WORKED IN EGYPT IN NORTH AFRICA IN JORDAN AND IT WILL BE A NORTH ATLANTIC WHICH MUST BE FASCINATING AND JUST THREATENING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY NOTICED THEIR FEATURES AND THEN AND THEN SEND YOU TO TIP TO GO AND CONFER
ALSO IT'S A BIT SORE TODAY IT'S JUST BEN AREN'T MY TEAM AND I HAVE DONE THIS WORK ARE A LION ON THE GROUND USING SATELLITE IMAGERY THAT WE PROCESS BUT THE IDEA WITH THIS PARTICULAR ART FORM
IS THAT THAT THAT WORKING IN A FACT WILL BE DONE BY THE CROWD AND ANY SITES ARE FEATURES THAT THEY FIRE WILL GO TO OUR TEAM WILL COLLABORATE WITH ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPERTS IN GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES
AND THEN WILL PECK THAT THE MOST INTERESTING FINDS TO GO NEXT YEAR ON THE CREW ON THE GROUND AND THE REALLY COOL PART AT THIS PLATFORM IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO END WITH PEOPLE FINDING THINGS
AND ANY ARCHAEOLOGISTS WHO GET THE DAY THE CROWD FINDS SAY THE CROWD FINDS WHAT ACTUALLY AND THEY'LL TAKE THE CROWD WITH THEM THREE USING PERISCOPE AND SKYPE IN GOOGLE PLUS AREN'T DEALT IN EFFECT BE GIVING THE CROWD THAT EXPERIENCE OF WHAT AN ARC YOU'LL DIG IT'S LIKE AND WHAT IS IT DONE
FOR ARCHAEOLOGY FOR OUR INTEREST IN ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT THEY DID THIS THIS COMING TOGETHER OF THE TECHNOLOGY I SUPPOSE WHICH IS WHICH HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE BUT ALSO THE THE THE FACT OF OF CROWD FUNNY WHAT DOES WHAT DOES IT DO WHAT ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE ACUTE VIRAL SHOWN ANOTHER SCIENTIST WITH THINGS LIKE GALAXIES WERE OXFORD WITHOUT THEY'RE GOING TO FIND GALAXY IS THE CROWD REALLY DOES HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WISDOM AND IT'S THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL KING REALLY HAVE CONNECTIVE EXPLORER SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FINDING THE THINGS
IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW GETTING KEEP ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE CROWD GETS TOGETHER ORGANISED TWEET UPSON GOAN AND THEN CLEAN UP AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OR GO VOLUNTEER TO SCORE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO WITH THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF KIDS AROUND THE WORLD YOU ARE GOING TO BE ENGAGED WITH ARCHAEOLOGY IN SUCH A DIFFERENT WAY BE ABLE TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TUTE ARTISTRY
THAT WAS DOUG'S PART TALKING TO ME FROM THE UNITED STATES LISA WESTCOTT WILKINS IS HERE CO FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF DIG VENTURES WHICH ALREADY CROWD FUNDS PROJECTS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU'RE INTENDING TO DO THIS AT LINDISFARNE THE GUESTS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS KIND OF WORK AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR OTHER PERSPECTIVES THAT'S THAT SERRA HAS ABOUT DOING THIS KIND OF WORK WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT IN THE COUNTRY SINCE TWENTY TWELVE AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO ROLLING OUT ALL THAT THAT IN THOSE TECHNIQUES EDMUND IS FINE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WELL IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE DIGGING FOR TWO WEEKS ALONGSIDE DOCTOR DAVID PAT'S FROM DURHAM UNIVERSITY LOOKING FOR THE VERY EARLIEST MONASTERY AT LINDISFARNE
BUT WHEN YOU SAY DIGGING OUT SLIGHTLY FOR ME IS THIS A VIRTUAL DIGGER A REAL DAY ANY ACTUAL FARE WITH A SPADE YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FROM FAR AWAY WELL FANTASTICALLY IN THIS CASE IT'S BOTH BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE ATTACKED PLATFORM WHICH IS CALLED DIGITAL DIG TEAM WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BASICALLY JOIN OUR DIG FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THE WAY THAT WORKS AS WELL WE'RE ON SAY WE'RE USING PERISCOPE AND WE'RE ALSO USING IRON AND SMARTPHONES TO RECORD INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE TRENCHES
WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S AVAILABLE INSTANTLY ONLINE ANYWHERE FOR ANYONE TO SEE TO SEE AND DO WHAT WITH THEM A NEW ARE YOU EXPECTING TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO ACTUALLY SAY LOOK THIS LOOKS LIKE X. OR Y. WELL THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE BEST CASE SCENARIO AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST PORTREE YES AND HER DIG A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE HAD AN OBJECT THAT WE FOUND IN ONE OF OUR FEATURES WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS OR WHAT IT WAS DOING THERE AND IT WENT OUT ON OUR PLATFORM
AND WITHIN ABOUT AN HOUR WE'D WE'D HEARD FROM SOMEONE WHO'D EXCAVATED SOMETHING SIMILAR AND THAT HELPED US TO ACTUALLY SPOT DATE THE FEATURE AND DETERMINED OUR STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD FOR FOR THAT TRENCH SO WE ARE HOPING AND EXPECTING FOR PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE IN THAT WAY ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN YOU SAY PEOPLE I MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE TWO GROUPS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE REAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIELDER THAN INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT A LOT WHO DO
YES AND WE'VE HAD PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE AND OUR SIDES AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES WORKING WITH THE CROWD SO FANTASTIC A JUST A SARAH HAS SAID THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WISDOM IN THE CROWD AND PASSION AND THEN WE MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE EVERYONE FROM DOCTORS TO PLUMBERS TO OUR NEIGHBOURS TOOK T'KIDS AND STUDENTS AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE TECH IS THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DEMOCRATISE AS THAT KIND OF INVOLVEMENT ANYONE CAN GET INVOLVED
DEMOCRATISE AND ENERGISES AS WELL I'LL GUARD ABSOLUTELY IT'S IT REALLY IS THE SOURCE OF OUR TRUE AGILITY AS ARCHAEOLOGISTS AS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THAT THIRST FOR PARTICIPATION AND ARCHAEOLOGY MASSIVE CHANGE COS YOU THINK OF ARCHAEOLOGY THEY HAD A BIT OF A DUSTY OLD FASCINATING AND ALL THE REST OF IT ACTUALLY KIND OF OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM YOU HAVE BROUGHT IT SO EASILY
JUST TO PEOPLE'S DESKTOPS YEAH IT REALLY IS THAT EASY AND THERE'S THERE'S NO BARRIERS TO ENTRY OR SARAH HAS IDENTIFIED IN ARCHAEOLOGY HAS TRADITIONALLY START HAVE BEEN A CLOSE DISCIPLINE BY THE WAY THEY WERE WORKING NOW THE SORT OF YOU KNOW ENABLING FACTOR OF TECHNO MEANS THAT ANYBODY CAN REALLY BE A PART OF OUR DAY AGAIN IN FACT WE LAUNCHED THE LINDA'S FOUND DIG THIS MORNING ONLINE ON OUR WEBSITE AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD PEOPLE ACCESSING OUT AND ASKING FOR MORE KNOWLEDGE
PEOPLE WAKE UP AND THEY WANT TO SEE MORE THEY CAN JUST HEAD OVER TO THE COMPUTERS TO OUR WEBSITE THIS MORNING AND HAVE A LOOK LISA WESKIT WILKINS CO FOUND A MANAGING DIRECTOR OF DIG VENTURES THANKS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN FOR A LONG TIME ANOTHER HAVE BEEN WARNINGS BY SENIOR FIGURES IN THE ENERGY WORLD WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY FOR OUR NEEDS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO THE ANSWER
USE THE NATIONAL GRID MORE EFFECTIVELY A SMART ENERGY REVOLUTION STORER INTERESTING EXPLOIT THE INTERNET AND SO ON AND SO ON AND SO WILL DOCTOR JENNIFER BAXTER IS THE HEAD OF ENERGY ABOUT HIM AT THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WILL PROVIDE THE SOLUTION DOCTOR BAXTER
GOOD MORNING JOY WELL THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW WE KNOW THAT THE TYPE OF ENERGY THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ONLY CONTRIBUTES ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF THE U.K.'S TOTAL ENERGY USE AND THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
THE OTHER EIGHTY PERCENT COMES FROM FORTY PER CENT HEAT AND FORTY PER CENT TRANSPORT SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMART GRIDS AND USING THE GRID MORE EFFECTIVELY BUT IS THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH I MEAN IF FOR ENTERED WITH A HEARING THIS MORNING ROGER URBAN'S TALKING ABOUT HOW YOUR FRIDGE OR YOUR FREEZER IS GOING TO BE SO SMART THAT
SORT OF CONTACT YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S URBAN AND SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF MY ENERGY I'LL SWITCH OFF WHILE YOU COOK OR SOME STUFF LIKE THAT I MEAN IT'S IT SOUNDS BIZARRE BUT IS IT SENSIBLE AND IS IT MEANINGFUL IT'S CERTAINLY A VERY INTERESTING IDEA THE WAY IN WHICH WE MANAGE DEMAND AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND HOW OUR APPLIANCES CAN MANAGE DEMAND FOR US BUT ANOTHER STATISTIC THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IS THAT LAST YEAR WE HAD ABOUT A SPARE KEY
GENERATING CAPACITY OF ONLY FOUR PER CENT DURING PEAK DEMAND IN THE WINTER TIME AND THIS IS VERY VERY SMALL AND WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF TIMES THAT THE NATIONAL GRID HAVE ASKED INDUSTRY TO LOWER THEIR DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY MEANING THAT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY TIMES WHEN IT IS VERY VERY CLOSE TO NOT BEING AND WE CAN PAY AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE FOR EMERGENCY ELECTRICITY AS IT WERE
YESTERDAY THE DEPARTMENT FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE THEY RELEASED A REPORT THEIR ESTIMATED THAT ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS WAS GOING TO BE NEEDED AN INVESTMENT INTO OUR ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE BY TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY WE WON'T SPEND THAT WILL BE US THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOT ON THE CARDS IS IT
WELL I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES IN ENERGY POLICY RECENTLY WHICH HAS MEANT THAT INVESTOR CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN QUITE LOW AND I'M SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF REPORTS OF INVESTORS BECOMING QUITE AN EASY ABOUT LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT LIKE THE ONE IN SOMERSET REGARDED AS A FIASCO
THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS OVER HINKLEY C. WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE ONE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS OVER NOT JUST NUCULAR POWER BUT ALSO COMBINED CYCLE GAS TURBINES AS WELL IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE INVESTORS FEEL THAT PERHAPS THE RETURN THAT THEY MAY RECEIVE MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT IF EVER THERE WAS A FIFTY GOOD TO DISASTER DON'T THEY A LOT OF PEOPLE
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN START TO APPROACH TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM TOO AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SOME POLICIES THAT SUGGEST THAT NEW NUCULAR AND COMBINED CYCLE GAS TURBINES ARE APPROPRIATE IN THEIR VIEW BOTH OF THESE ARE COSTLY AND CAN OFTEN TAKE A LONG TIME TO BUILD SO THERE IS A NEED NOW TO START LOOKING AT OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT I BELIEVE THE REPORTS COMING OUT TODAY DOES ACTUALLY IMPLY
GO TO BAXTER THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES SEVEN TIME FOR THE WEATHER HERE IS FULL OF IT
THANKS VERY MUCH JUST A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU LET'S START THE DAY'S FORECAST OF THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND WALES THE NORTH AND WEST MIDLANDS NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND ARE ALL OF YOU AT SOME POINT OR OTHER DURING THE COURSE TODAY GOING TO BE INVOLVED WITH A WEATHER FRONT WHICH OVERNIGHT AS BROUGHT RAIN AT THE VERY LOWEST LEVELS BUT SNOW SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF SNOW TO NOT REALLY VERY HIGH LEVELS AT ALL I'M AFRAID THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND WILL BE STUCK WITH THIS WRETCHED FRONT ALL DAY THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE FRONT WEST OF THE PENNINES WILL GRADUALLY SLUMP ITS WAY DOWN THROUGH WALES CLEARING NORTHERN IRELAND

THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS LAUNCHED HIS STRONGEST ATTACK YET ON THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE U.K. TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SUGGESTING THEY'RE SMEARS AND THREATS COULD CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT WRITING IN THE DAILY MAIL HERE STOP SHORT OF ANY DIRECT CRITICISM OF DAVID CAMERON BUT HE SAYS THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING SUCH CLAIMS COULD BE UNDERMINED IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
WRITING IN THE DAILY MAIL IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAYS THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.K. TO REMAIN IN THE Y. U. IS CHARACTERISED BY SPIN SMEARS AND THREATS IN WHAT WILL BE SEEN AS IMPLICIT CRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ALLIES HE SAYS THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING WHAT HE CALLS DESPERATE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE E.U. IS AT STAKE
MISTER DUNCAN SMITH SAYS THOSE BEHIND THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAVE WILFULLY SHIFTED THE DEBATE AWAY FROM THE MERITS OF THE Y. YOU REFORM DEAL DAVID CAMERON STRUCK IN BRUSSELS TO SCAREMONGERING ABOUT WHETHER THE U.K. CAN STAND ALONE
THIS IS THE STRONGEST INTERVENTION YET FROM THEIR WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY WHO SAYS THE CAMPAIGN IS BEING CONDUCTED IN AN ACRIMONIOUS WAY AND APPEARS TO SUGGEST IT COULD DAMAGE THE GOVERNMENT AND BRITISH POLITICS BEYOND THE REFERENDUM

IT'S A COUNTRY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE THERE WERE A FEW MOMENTS OF LEVITY AMIDST THE MUD SLINGING AT ONE POINT TED CRUISE POKED FUN AT THE BUSINESSMAN URGING HIM TO BREATHE
BUT IT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH IS GASPING FOR ANSWERS MANY WANT TO STOP HIM WINNING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION THEY'RE ARE UNSURE JUST HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS ORDERED HIS MILITARY TO BE READY TO FIRE THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE STATE NEWS AGENCY IN PYONGYANG SAID HE'D ALSO DIRECTED THAT NORTH KOREA BE CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING A PRE EMPTY OF STRIKE THE REMARKS FOLLOW NEW UNITED NATION SANCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO A NUCLEAR TEST AND ROCKET LAUNCHED IN JANUARY
BRITISH SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED A WAY TO GUIDE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL CANCERS IN WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN EXCITING ADVANCE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE WRITING IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE THE TEAMS SUGGEST THAT THEIR METHOD COULD BE USED TO FIND UNIQUE FEATURES WITHIN A CANCER TUMOUR HELPING THE BODY'S OWN DEFENCES TO TARGET THE DISEASED CELLS HERE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
THIS DETAILED WORK BY CANCER SCIENTISTS FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO HOW CELLS FROM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CALLED T. CELLS RECOGNISE SOME OF THE EARLIEST MUTATIONS IN THE CELLS OF TUMOURS THE HOPE IS THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN BE HARNESSED TO DEVELOP VACCINES WHICH WOULD STIR UP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND ATTACK PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE'S CANCERS
CANCER RESEARCH U.K. WHICH FUNDED THE WORK SAYS THE NEXT STAGE IN THE COMING YEARS IS TO BEGIN TRIALS OF VACCINES WHICH ACTIVATE THE T. CELLS OR EVEN TO HARVEST THE T. CELLS AND PUT THEM BACK INTO PATIENTS SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THIS COULD TARGET THE ACHILLES HEEL OF SOME HIGHLY COMPLEX FORMS OF THE DISEASE
BUT THIS THEORETICAL WORK HASN'T YET BEEN TRIED ON PATIENTS AND PERSONALISING MEDICINE IN THIS WAY WOULD PROVE EXPENSIVE SOME SCIENTISTS HAVE WORN TO THE WORK COULD PROVE DIFFICULT BECAUSE MANY CANCERS KEEP EVOLVING AND MIGHT THEREFORE PROVE COMPLEX TARGETS
SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA BELIEVE AN ADVANCED VACCINE FOR THE SEEKER VIRUS COULD BE READY FOR HUMAN TRIALS BY AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER THE RESEARCH IS TAKING PLACE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN MARYLAND A GLOBAL HEALTH CORRESPONDENT TULIP WAS UNDER IS THERE
THE SCIENTISTS IN THIS LAB HELPS DEVELOP AN ADVANCED VACCINE FOR A BOWLER DURING THAT OUTBREAK NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE SAME FOR ZEKE UP WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON PREGNANT WOMEN BECAUSE OF THE STRONGLY SUSPECTED LINK BETWEEN THE VIRUS AND BABIES BEING BORN WITH UNDERDEVELOPED BRAINS DOCTOR ANTHONY FOUND THE INSTITUTE'S DIRECTOR SAYS HE'S HOPING HUMAN CHILD WILL START IN AMERICA SOON WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE THAT'S READY TO GO INTO HUMANS TO TEST
TO DISTRIBUTE BUT TEST FOR SAFETY AND FOR WHERE THEY WERE AND INDUCES A RESPONSE THAT YOU WOULD PROJECT WOULD BE PROTECTED
THAT PHASE ONE TRIAL I BELIEVE WILL LIKE WE START TOWARDS THE END OF THE SUMMER OR EARLY FOR THESE PHASE ONE TRIALS ARE ONLY THE START OF A LONG PROCESS THE EARLIEST SCIENTISTS HERE EXPECT HAVE A VACCINE FOR MUCH WIDER DISTRIBUTION IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN
BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS AGREED TO PAY AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CHILDREN WHO WERE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY ONE OF ITS PILOTS IN AFRICA SIMON WOOD COMMITTED SUICIDE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT HE'D SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHILDREN WHILE DOING VOLUNTARY WORK IN KENYA AND UGANDA BE A. AGREED TO THE PAYMENT BUT HAS DENIED LIABILITY ANGUS CRAWFORD REPORTS
SIMON WOULD WON AWARDS FROM THE A. FOR HIS CHARITY WORK BUT THREE YEARS AGO HE WAS CHARGED WITH INDECENT ASSAULT AND TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
NEWS WAS TOLD B.A. STAFF WERE FIRST WARNED OF CONCERNS ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR IN KENYA IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THIRTY EIGHT CHILDREN THE YOUNGEST JUST FOR AT THE TIME OF THE ABUSE SUED THE AIRLINE BRITISH AIRWAYS SAYS THE ALLEGATIONS ARE HORRIFYING AND ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT ADMIT ANY LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IT HAS AGREED TO PAY COMPENSATION
THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL SOLICITORS ACTING FOR THE VICTIMS SAY OTHER EMPLOYERS WHO SEND STAFF TO DO VOLUNTARY WORK MUST MAKE SURE PROPER SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN TOLD IT COULD SAVE EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IF IT USED ELECTRICITY MORE WISELY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION HAS CALLED FOR AN ENERGY REVOLUTION TO IMPROVE THE WAY ELECTRICITY IS STORED AND USED IN THE U.K. HE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER KARABIN THE GRID IS FACING A CRISIS NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS INCOMING DECADES WE ALSO FACE A GROWING DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY FOR POWERING CARS AND HEATING HOMES
THE GREAT UNRAVELLED WOULD STRETCH TO THE MOON AND BACK SO WE CAN'T RENEW IT ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION SAYS THE ANSWER IS AN ENERGY REVOLUTION IN WHICH INTERMITTENT ENERGY FROM WIND AND SOLAR IS STORED IN BATTERIES OR OTHER DEVICES TO BE USED LATER WHEN DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY PEAKS
EVENTUALLY AN INTERNET OF ENERGY COULD TURN OFF YOUR FREEZER TO SAVE POWER AT A TIME OF PEAK DEMAND AND TURN ON YOUR DISHWASHER TO USE ENERGY WHEN ITS CHEAPEST
THE COMMISSION SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO MAKE THAT REVOLUTION HAPPEN
SEVERAL OF THE WORLD'S LEADING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE GONE TO COURT BACKING APPLE IN ITS BATTLE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THE F.B.I. WANTS APPLE TO HELP AT ACCESS ENCRYPTED DATA ON AND I PHONE WHICH BELONGED TO A MAN WHO SHOT DEAD FOURTEEN PEOPLE AT SAN BERNARDINO AND CALIFORNIA GOOGLE MICROSOFT FACEBOOK AND AMAZON ARE CONCERNED THE CASE WILL ALSO AFFECT THEM
THANK YOU IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S NEWS THIS MORNING ANOTHER ENCOURAGING PIECE OF PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER IT'S A SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH IT'S NOT A CLINICAL TRIAL BUT THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT THE ALL IMPORTANT CLINICAL WORK MIGHT BE DONE PRETTY SOON WITHIN TWO YEARS WRITING IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE BRITISH RESEARCHERS THEY'RE AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON SAY THEY'VE WORKED OUT A METHOD TO FIND THE FEATURES OF A CANCER TUMOUR
BUT THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM MIGHT ATTACK PROFESSOR PETER JOHNSON IS ON THE LINE CHIEF CLINICIAN AT CANCER RESEARCH U.K. GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD ON IT AND WE KNOW THAT IMMUNOTHERAPY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE PART OF OUR ATTACK ON CANCER WITH THIS
THIS ASSISTS DOES IT AND BETTER TARGETS THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE IS THAT RIGHT YES WE HAVE SEEN ALREADY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN THE CLINIC WITH SOME OF THESE TREATMENTS WHICH LET LOOSE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND SUPPRESS SOME OF THE CONTROLS AND WE'RE NOW STARTING TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL WE KNOW THAT CANCERS DEVELOP MUTATIONS IN THEIR GENETIC CODE
WE THOUGHT FOR US LONG TIME THAT THESE MIGHT BE A GOOD DANGER SIGNAL FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONE BIT OF THE CANCER CELL WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS ALL THE OTHER CELLS IN THE BODY AND THE MORE MUTATIONS THAT YOU SEE IN THESE CANCER CELLS THE STRONGER THE DANGER SIGNAL COULD BEAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND WHAT THIS PIECE OF RESEARCH HAS DONE IS TO PUT THE MISSING LINK
AND SHOWN THAT A T. CELLS THE CELLS OF OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT ARE CAPABLE OF ERADICATING CANCER CAN ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF THESE MUTATIONS AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT NOW WE KNOW WHAT THESE T. CELLS CAN SEE WE'RE IN A POSITION NOT ONLY TO CUT THE BRAKES ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT TO REALLY STEER THE CAR AS IT GOES DOWNHILL AND TO WORK OUT HOW WE CAN TARGET THESE RESPONSES MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THE CAMPS AND HOW WOULD WE DO
PROBABLY WHAT WE'LL DO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS TO LOOK AT THE SEQUENCES OF THE GENES WHICH ARE ABNORMAL IN INDIVIDUAL KEPT PEOPLE'S CANCERS AND SEE IF WE CAN WORK OUT HOW TO MAKE A VACCINE SPECIFICALLY AGAINST THOSE ABNORMALITIES SO WHAT IT'LL MEAN HE'S TAKING A BIOPSY FROM SOMEBODY'S CANCER WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE DO ANYWAY TO MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS AND THEN LOOKING AT A VERY DETAILED LEVEL AT THE MOLECULAR CHANGES IN THERE TO SEE WHICH OF THOSE MIGHT BE A GOOD DANGER SIGNAL TO GET THE IMMUNE SYSTEM DON'T HAVE AGAINST AND THAT WOULD BE GENUINELY UNIQUE TO THEM
IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR ANYWHERE ELSE THAT'S RIGHT EVERYBODY'S CANCER IS DIFFERENT AND EVERYBODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT AND HOW THEY MATCH AND OVERLAP AND HOW YOU CAN GET THAT RECOGNITION TO HAPPEN HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS SO THE TECHNOLOGY FOR DOING THIS IS OF COURSE COMPLICATED AND QUITE RECENT BUT NOW THAT WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO
PROCESS THIS INFORMATION USING THE COMPUTING POWER THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON PICTURED GNOMIC CODE THAT WE STARTING TO DISENTANGLE WE'RE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD MUCH MORE QUICKLY FROM THE TISSUE AND SOMEBODY TO THE IDEA OF A VACCINE PRICEY THOUGH
IT WILL BE PRICED AT THE BEGINNING BUT LIKE ALL THESE THINGS ONCE YOU START DOING IT AT SCALE AND ONCE YOU WORK OUT THE PIPELINE FOR HOW YOU MAKE IT WORK OF COURSE THE COST WILL COME DOWN AND THERE'LL BE A LOT OF COMPETITION IN THIS AREA AND I WAS SAYING IN THE INTRODUCTION THERE POSSIBLY WITHIN TWO YEARS SOME CLINICAL TRIALS THAT THAT THAT THAT USE THIS RESEARCH WHICH SOUNDS LIKE
PRETTY SPEEDY MINUTES SOUNDS OF PEOPLE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS ISN'T SOME AREA OF SCIENCE WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK THAT THEY REALLY DO FEEL THE PEOPLE AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE HAVE DONE THIS AT THE UNDERSIDE
YES WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF RESULTS COMING OUT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS NOT ONLY IN THE U.K. BUT IN EUROPE AND THE U.S.A. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH HAVE BEEN MOVING TOWARDS THIS AND I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ARE STARTING TO MOVE TOWARDS THIS VACCINE SO I THINK WE WILL SEE IT HAPPEN REALLY QUITE QUICKLY WE HAVE HAD NEWS EARLIER ON IN THE WEEK OF A TRIAL FOR A FOR A VACCINE PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN TOLD THEY HAD TERMINAL CANCER THIS IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE
GETS THAT VACCINE WAS AGAINST SOMETHING WHICH YOU FIND IN ALL CANCERS AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THAT TYPE OF VACCINE THE PAST IS THAT IT'S REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO GET THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STIRRED UP AGAINST SOMETHING RATHER GENERIC IT SEEMS TO BE THE PARTICULAR DANGER SIGNALS IN PARTICULAR CANCERS THAT GET SEEN BY INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE'S IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT CONSTITUTE BY FAR THE STRONGEST DANGER SIGNAL
SO I THINK THAT THESE INDIVIDUALISED VACCINES MAY WELL TAKE US SEVERAL NOTCHES UP THE SCALE OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOU CAN MAKE THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THESE RESULTS PROFESSOR PETER JOHNSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CEASEFIRE IS HOLDING MORE OR LESS BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL FLEEING FROM THE COUNTRY AND THERE IS PLENTY OF PLENTY HAPPENING ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THE REFUGEES THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL IS MEETING THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY TODAY AND IN PARIS THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S MEETING THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR WELL I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE FORMER BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY DAVID MILIBAND HE NOW RUNS A CHARITY THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE THAT WORKS IN SYRIA
I PUT IN THERE BIT OF NATO'S MOST SENIOR COMMANDER IN EUROPE GENERAL PHILIP BREEDLOVE THAT RUSSIA AND THE ASAD REGIME ARE DELIBERATELY WEAPONISED SEEING THE MIGRATION CRISIS
I THINK IT'S A STRETCH TO SAY THAT THE RUSSIANS INTERVENED IN SYRIA IN ORDER TO CAUSE TROUBLE FOR EUROPEANS I THINK IT'S FAR MORE PLAUSIBLE TO SAY THAT IT'S A HAPPY BY PRODUCT FOR THEM OF AN INTERVENTION THAT WAS UNDERTAKEN LAST SEPTEMBER THE AIR CAMPAIGN THAT THEY STARTED THAT THEY THEY INTERVENE BECAUSE I SAT THERE THEIR CLIENT PRESENT AS WAS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE
THEY WANTED TO REASSERT OUR GLOBAL ROLE FOR RUSSIA AND ALSO THEY WERE STRUGGLING IN UKRAINE I THINK THAT'S A FAR MORE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY INTERVENED ORIGINALLY NOW THEY SEE EUROPE IN TURMOIL AS THE RESULT OF THE MIGRATION REFUGEE CRISIS BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE IF WE CAN PUT THAT ASIDE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS CEASEFIRE
I THINK THEY'RE SERIOUS ABOUT A CEASE FIRE ON THEIR OWN TERMS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT A CEASEFIRE THAT STRENGTHENS THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT ASAD OTHER CIRRUS ABOUT SAY CEASEFIRE BUT KERBS WHAT THEY FEAR IS THE PROSPECT OF FURTHER RADICALISATION THAT COULD EAT ITS WAY INTO THEIR OWN SPHERE
AND I THINK THAT THEY ALSO ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CEASEFIRE PUTS THEM RIGHT CENTRE STAGE BECAUSE THIS IS IN PART ABOUT RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND IT'S GLOBAL
WE'VE GOT SOME PEEPS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE INSIDE CYRIL INTERNATIONAL DIGNITY WHICH ARE WRONG AND THEY REPORT TO ME THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO GET SOME HUMANITARIAN AID TO PEOPLE NORTH OF ALEPPO FOR EXAMPLE THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE LAST WEEK BUT EVEN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OWN A NEWS RELEASE SHOWS THAT THE MAP OF SYRIA THE PARTS OF THE MATTER SIR HAVE THE COVER BUT SEES FORESTRY LIMITED
SO AT THIS STAGE I THINK THAT YOU'VE GOT TO SAY THE JURY'S OUT FOR THE RUSSIANS THE MILITARY PUSH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY STRENGTHEN THE POSITIONAL A SIX MONTH AND IF THEY SEE INSTRUCTING FURTHER I'LL CARRY ON BUT WHAT MATTERS CLEARLY AS YOU'VE JUST SUGGESTED IT IS IS THAT WE CAN HELP THOSE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SUFFERING THERE IS THE CEASEFIRE REALLY GOING TO ENABLE US TO GET TOO MANY MORE OF THEM AS TIME GOES BY AND INDEED ON THE WIDER PICTURE DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT
RESULT IN PEACE
I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO TALK ABOUT PEACE HE SEES FAR AT IT DOESN'T COVER THE RANGE OF JIHADIST GROUPS I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE ON THE GROUND IS THAT WHILE THE CEASEFIRE HAS BEEN BROKEN I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKEN TO THAT'S THE WHILE THE CEASEFIRE HAS BEEN BROKEN IN FLURRIES IT'S ACTUALLY HELD BETTER THEM
MANY PEOPLE WANTED BUT THE FLOW OF PEOPLE THE EXODUS REALLY HAVE PEOPLE FROM SYRIA IS CONTINUING INTO LEBANON JORDAN TURKEY AND OBVIOUSLY INTO EUROPE AS WELL AND FROM WHAT I CAN SEE UNTIL YOU DON'T JUST GET THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS ROUND THE TABLE BUT THE IRANIANS AND THE SAUDIS AS WELL
UNTIL THE COSTS OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONFLICT ARE GREAT OFFER ALL THE COSTS OF CONTINUATION AND I FEAR THAT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AND THE REST OF THE REGION THERE ARE REALLY INTOLERABLE BURDEN SO WHAT OUGHT THE NEXT STEP TO BE
THE PROTECTION THE CIVILIANS INSIDE SIR HE'S AN ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE TRUST TO STAUNCH THE BLOOD SUGAR SECONDLY THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT AGREEMENT AT THE LONDON CONFERENCE LAST MONTHS TO GIVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER LONG TERM ECONOMIC
FOR THE NEIGHBOURING STATES AND TO TO ALLOW THEM TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WANT JUST PATCHED UP IN THEIR SHORTS AND WE'VE GOT THE CHANCE TO WORK AND THEN THE THIRD RING OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY WITHIN EUROPE ITSELF WHERE THE CHOICE THAT EUROPE FACES IS EITHER DISORDERLY ILLEGAL CHAOTIC ARRIVALS INTO EUROPE
OR A MORE ORGANISED AND LEGAL PROCESS BECAUSE WE ARE RECEIVING A THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY ON THE ISLAND LET'S HORSE IN IN GREECE AND THAT NUMBER IS ONLY GONNA INCREASE AS THE WEATHER IMPROVES
DAVID MILIBAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU BUT I'M SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST ADVERTISING COMPANIES W. P. P. IS BUCKING IT SEEMS THE GLOBAL TREND WITH A PROFIT JUMP FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN TANYA'S SAID YES REVENUES UP PRETTY STRONGLY TO THIS IS THE COMPANY W. P. P. WHICH INCLUDES OGILVY AND MATHER BUS AND IT REPORTED TWENTY FIFTEEN PROFITS UP BY SEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT THIS IS TO ONE POINT ONE SIX BILLION POUND SIR MARTIN SORRELL
IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WHO JOINS ME NOW DOWN THE LINE SO MUCH AND SO IN THE FACE OF A GLOBAL ECONOMIC OR WOBBLE IF WE CAN CALL IT THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING QUITE WELL HAS THAT
I THINK BECAUSE WE'RE VERY DIVERSE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN GEOGRAPHICALLY IS STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA WE'VE INCREASED OUR MARKET SHARE QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY IN NORTH AMERICA IT'S TRUE BY WINNING SIGNIFICANT MET NEW NUBIA'S NOT JUST FROM EXISTING CLIENTS BUT NEW CLIENTS WE HAVE SEEN A STRONGER WESTERN CONTINENTAL EUROPE U.K. AS CONTINUE STRONG TOO
ASIA LATIN AMERICA AFRICAN MIDDLE EASTERN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE WOULD BE MORE PATCHY BUT WE'VE SEEN GROWTH FOR EXAMPLE STRONG GROWTH IN INDIA AND WHAT WE CALL THE NEXT ELEVEN SO THE NON BRICK FAST GROWING GROWING MARKETS AND WE'VE SEEN ADVERTISING AND MEDIA GENERALLY ACROSS THERE WERE VERY STRONG AND DIGITAL IN IT IN ALL ITS FORMS A VERY MOBILE ONLINE AS SOCIAL
DOES IT HOW IS IT RE BALANCING BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL T.V. ADVERTISING AND BILLBOARDS AND SO ON THAT WE ALL WE ALL IMAGINE WHEN WE THINK OF ADVERTISING TOWARDS THE INTERNET AND MOBILE ADVERTISING AND SO ON WELL I'M FILLINGS THAT MEDIA REVENUES ARE A BIT A BILLINGS ARE ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS AND NOW READ NEWS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION AND OF EACH OF THOSE FIGURES ABOUT FORTY PER CENT NOW IS DIGITAL IN ALL ITS FORMS SO IT'S BECOMING IF I WENT BACK FIFTEEN YEARS IT WAS VIRTUALLY ZERO
SO ALMOST HALF OF OUR REVENUES NOW ARE COMING FROM DIGITAL AND THEY DIDN'T EXIST FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO THERE HAS BEEN A VERY STRONG SURGE THAT YOU SEE IN THE TELEVISION AREA IN THE NEWSPAPER OR MAGAZINE AIR OF THE GROWTH OF DIGITAL MEDIA IS BEING HAD A VERY BIG IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS THE MARGINS THERE ARE EQUAL OR GREATER THAN TRADITIONAL MARGIN SO BEEN A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES WHAT WE CALL PROGRAMMATIC WHICH IS HIGHLY TARGETED
MEDIA BUYING USING SOPHISTICATED DATA TO REACH PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON THE AMERICAN ELECTION ACTUALLY A POLITICAL ELECTION POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF THOSE WE CAN TARGET PEOPLE MORE EFFECTIVELY TO TWO MESSAGE AND PROVIDE MESSAGING TO THEM SO WELL I WAS GONNA SAY ALL THESE AREAS HAVE BEEN DIGITAL AND DATA AND CONTENT AROUND THAT HAVE BEEN BURNED JUST VERY BRIEFLY THEN WHAT ROLE ARE YOU PLAYING AT THE U.S. ELECTION
WELL A COUPLE OF OUR COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON THE ELECTION ON EDGING ON ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE
BUT THEY ARE WORKING PARTICULARLY IN THE DATA AREA THE SOCIAL AREA THE POLLING AREA AND THEY'RE PROVIDING A SORT OF VERY VERY DETAILED SOPHISTICATED TARGETED ADVICE FOR THE CANDIDATES ON HOW THEY REACH THE ELECTORATE AND DEVELOP THEIR MESSAGES SO MARTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE WE MUST LEAVE IT THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE VENICE BIENNALE IS ARGUABLY THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS ART SHOW IN THE WORLD ARTIST KILLED FOR THE HONOUR OF THE PRESTIGE OF REPRESENTED THEIR COUNTRY WILL THIS MORNING WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHO WILL REPRESENT BRITAIN THIS YEAR IN FACT WE SHALL ALLOW ARTS EDITOR WILL GONE PUTS TO TELL US AND THEN INTERVIEW THE PERSON WHO ME HE'S GOING TO ME WILMA MORNING TO YOU I FEEL LIKE AN
THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET OSCAR WELL THE TRUTH IS I THINK IT'S QUITE EXCITING THE THE ARTIST REPRESENTING BRITAIN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS A SEVENTY ONE YEAR OLD SCULPTOR
PHYLLIDA BARLOW NOT THE HOT YOUNG TURK BUT A PRE Y. B. A. AS IN FACT SHE WAS A TEACHER AND A MENTOR TO SOME OF THE WAY HE BEHAVES IN A ROLE AS A PROFESSOR OF FINE BRITISH ART IS THE SLADE SHE MAKES I DO HOPE YOUR GRIEF BUT IN MY VIEW THE WORK I'VE SEEN I DESCRIBE IT IT'S A RICKETY AND RAMSHACKLE OFTEN
COLOSSAL IT CERTAINLY WAS AT TATE BRITAIN'S AT THE SCULPTURES ARE MADE OUT OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE FRANKLY BRIC A BRAC PLYWOOD CARDBOARD PLASTERED CEMENT I MAYBE CALL OF A STEPTOE AND SON OF A SCAVENGER I HATE TO TELL YOU SHE IS LAUGHING AT THAT FORTUNATELY FOR YOU
GAVIN I'D SAY WHO MAKE SCULPTURES THAT LOOK LIKE A VILLAGE BONFIRE THE DAY BEFORE FIREWORKS WERE DESTROYED IN THE DISCARDED THE FRAGILE THE OVERLOOKED TO MAKE WORKS THAT OFTEN DISPLAYED IN THIS IS IMPORTANT IN SORT OF THE MARBLED HALLS OF THE ART ESTABLISHMENT I THINK
IN ALL HONESTY SHE IS AN ENLIGHTENED CHOICE HIS RAG AND BONE SCULPTURES WILL COME TO GLORIOUS LIFE IN THE NEO CLASSICAL BRITISH PAVILION
IN VENICE WOW WHAT A BIG BUILD UP LIKE THAT AND FEEL THAT THE CONGRATULATIONS BY THE WAY WELCOME TO YOU THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH BUT FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH ALL THIS RICKETY AND RAMSHACKLE AND RAG AND BONE AND STEPTOE AND SON YES SORRY
THE MATERIALS ARE OFTEN ACTUALLY BRAND NEW BUT I THINK MY WAY OF ASSEMBLING THEM IS VERY SPONTANEOUS AND VERY
QUICK AND IT DOES LOOK RICKETY DUMMY THEY DIDN'T LOOK I'M LOOKING AT PART OF YOUR DOC TATE BRITAIN COMMISSION AND IT IT DOES LOOK YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SORT OF CRAWL UNDER IT JUST IN CASE IT'S A LOT OF YOU I LIKE PERILOUS THINGS I LIKE THE SENSE OF
SCULPTURE THAT IS ONLY JUST HOLDING ITSELF TOGETHER IS BALANCING AND VERY INTERESTED IN THAT WAY IN WHICH THINGS CAN BE ABOUT TO FALL OR HAVE FALLEN
SO WE HAVEN'T MET HAVE ALL FOUGHT SOME IF IT IS IT JUST PURELY PHYSICAL THING YOU LIKE THE APPEARANCE OF THE SENSATION YOU GET OR DOES IT MEAN SOMETHING HERE WE LIVE IN A PERILOUS WORLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I THINK THE METAPHOR HAS GROWN AND I'M THINKING I THINK I'M ONE OF THOSE ARTISTS WHO PROBABLY DOESN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT MY WORK IS ABOUT THE OUTSET BUT IT BEGINS TO DISCOVER ITSELF AS
I MAKE IT AND IN A WAY THE WAY THINGS CAN COLLAPSE IN FRONT OF ME AND THEY DO OH YES AND THEN THEN I CAN START AGAIN SO YOU HAVE TO BUILD THEM IN IN THE GALLERY WHERE THEY'RE BEING DISPLAYED NO I USUALLY BUILD THEM IN THE STUDIO
AS A KIND OF PRACTICE RUN RIGHT AND THEN WE GO CERTAINLY AT THE TATE IT NEEDED A LOT OF PRACTICE RUNS BECAUSE WE HAD TO WORK WITH QUITE STRINGENT
ENGINEERS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY ONCE YOU CALL THEM THE SAME IN YELLOW COATS OR SOMETHING IT IS JACKET EXACTLY BUT BUT THAT'S WHAT THE THINGS THAT REALLY FASCINATED ME IS THAT YOU DESTROY THEM AT THE END OF IT ALL AND RECYCLE THE MATERIAL DO YOU ALWAYS DO THAT NOW NO NOT SOMETIMES SOMETIMES I HAVE IN THE PAST I HAVE BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS LIKE WORKING
BEYOND MY OWN SCALE I'VE ALWAYS LIKED REACHING UP INTO THE ARCHITECTURAL SPACES AND USING THE SECTIONS THAT ARE MY OWN SCALE BUT WHEN YOU START TO ASSEMBLE THEM THEY BECOME
SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING ELSE DOES SO ON THAT BASIS YOU'LL NEVER GET IT TO BE AS RICH AS DAMIEN HIRST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SELL THEM FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF POEMS I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT
OH LOVE REFEREE MIGHT BE A LITTLE CHANGE PRACTICALLY REQUIRED NOW AS A RESULT SHE HAD INTO I'M US RETHINK THAT I LEFT OF MY SOAK LOOK SHE'S ON YOUR TEAM WOULDN'T IT ABSOLUTELY SO IT'S JUST A BIT OF WOOD ABOUT THERE BE AN OLLIE BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT'S OF THAT HUGE HONOUR YES IT'S A MASSIVE HONOUR
COMPLETELY ASTONISHED BECAUSE IN A WAY I'VE BEEN THAT THING CALLED A MINOR BRITISH ARTISTS AN M.B.E. YES AN N.B.A. EXACTLY FOR MOST OF MY WORKING LIFE AND LIME
I'M GETTING THINGS THAT WERE WAY BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS SO IS COMPLETELY EXTRAORDINARY AND I THANK THE BRITISH COUNCIL FOR SELECTING ME IT'S QUITE FANTASTIC AND IT IS A GREAT HONOUR SWELL AND THE BUILDING IS EXTRAORDINARY THERE WHERE CAN WE SEE YOUR WORK NOW YOU CAN SEE MY WORK IN
LOS ANGELES I WAS HOPING YOU SAY TEAM WRITTEN THAT NO TATE MODERN THAT SORRY TATE TATE MODERN I'VE GOT A PIECE ON THERE MUSTN'T LET NOT THAT'S IN THE TATE MODERN AND THERE WE CAN GO AND SEE HER THEIR WEALTH THEIR FILL OF BARLOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IF YOU'RE STILL LISTENING FOR EGGS THAT YOU DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TO ANY SIX MINUTES WITH THE SPORT GOOD MORNING IT WAS GOLD FOR LAURA TROTT ON DAY TWO OF THE TRACK CYCLING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN LONDON THE DOUBLE OLYMPIC CHAMPION CAME OUT ON TOP IN THE WOMEN SCRATCH RACE
THE VICTORY CAME AFTER DISAPPOINTMENT FOR TROT AND HER WOMEN'S PURSUIT TEAMMATES EARLIER WHEN THEY FAILED TO QUALIFY FOR THE GOLD MEDAL RACE THE QUARTET CAN STILL CLAIM BRONZE TODAY SIR BRADLEY WIGGINS AND THE MEN'S PURSUIT TEAM HAD TO SETTLE FOR SILVER AFTER BEING BEATEN BY AUSTRALIA DESPITE THE DEFEAT WIGGIN SAID HE'D PUT HIS HOUSE ON THEM WINNING AT THE OLYMPICS GREAT BRITAIN ALSO COLLECTED A BRONZE LAST NIGHT WITH BECKY JAMES PUTTING THREE YEARS OF INJURY PROBLEMS BEHIND HER WITH A TOP THREE FINISH IN THE KEIRIN
ENGLAND'S WOMEN HAVE LOST THEIR FIRST MATCH OF FOOTBALL'S SHE BELIEVES CUP IN FLORIDA WELL CHAMPIONS SAY WON ONE NIL GREAT BRITAIN BEGIN THEIR DEFENCE OF THE DAVIS CUP IN BIRMINGHAM TODAY ANDY MURRAY IN HIS FIRST COMPETITIVE MATCH SINCE BECOMING A FATHER WILL OPEN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE WORLD NUMBER EIGHTY SEVEN TARO DANIEL HERE'S OUR TENNIS CORRESPONDENT RUSSELL FULLER
LAST YEAR'S DAVIS CUP TRIUMPH MAY NOT PROVE TO BE A FLASH IN THE PAN MURRAY HE'S TALKING LIKE A MAN WHO WANTS TO BE PART OF EVERY BRITISH TEAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND CAPTAIN LEON SMITH BELIEVES THE UNIQUE ATMOSPHERE THE COMPETITION WILL ONCE AGAIN PROVE A STRONG SPUR ESPECIALLY WHEN AT HOME NINE THOUSAND FANS WILL BE SUPPORTING MARIE LATER AGAINST TARA DANIEL A MAN WHO WAS BORN IN NEW YORK LIVES IN VALENCIA AND AS A HUGE LED ZEPPELIN FAN HE'S HOPING TO BUMP INTO ROBERT PLANT HERE IN BIRMINGHAM THIS WEEK
ANOTHER LOCAL FAVOURITE DAN EVANS THEN TAKES ON KANE ISCHIA CORY IN THEIR SECOND MATCH OF THE DAY DAN EVANS REPLACES CAR EDMUND WHO WAS EXPECTED TO PLAY TWO SINGLES REBELS BUT INJURED HIS BACK DURING PRACTICE IN BIRMINGHAM CAPTAIN LEON SMITH BELIEVES EVANS CAN PERFORM WELL AGAINST A PLAYER RANKED ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PLACES ABOVE HIM
IT'S A TOUGH TASK SHE CALLING US NUMBER SIX IN THE WORLD WORLDLY STARTING WEST BUT IT'S THE FORMAT OF THE COMPETITION IS NOT JUST ABOUT THAT ONE MATCH
AND EXPRESS HIMSELF TOMORROW FRIDAY AND SHARPEN THE SENSES FOR WHAT COULD BE A DECIDING ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON SO YOU'VE GROWN AND EXPRESS HIMSELF AND HE'S A LOCAL LAD I'M SURE YOUR RICE LOCATION IF BRITAIN CAN GET PAST JAPAN PANNED BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND THEY'LL FACE EITHER KAZAKHSTAN OR WORLD NUMBER ONE NOVAK DJOKOVIC IS SERBIA A WEEK AFTER THE WIMBLEDON FINAL ANDY MURRAY WANTS TO PLAY AS MANY MATCHES AS HE CAN
THAT PERIOD OF THE YEAR WITH WIMBLEDON DAVIS CARR IN THE OLYMPICS AND THE U.S. OPEN THE FRENCH OPEN IS ON THAT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WIMBLEDON AS WELL THAT IS SO CONDENSE AND SO COMPACT AND SO MANY SURFACE CHANGES THAT IT WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT THE DAVIES GOT GAVE ME A LOT LAST YEAR
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS TEAM AS MUCH AS I CAN AND IN THE FUTURE SO LONG AS THEIR HOSTEL AND EVOLVED SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS TIE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT AND THERE'LL BE LIVE COVERAGE OF ANDY MURRAY'S MATCH ON B. B. C. TWO FROM ONE O'CLOCK
HULL CITY MISSED OUT ON THE CHANCE TO GO TOP OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP THEY WERE BEATEN ONE NIL AT BIRMINGHAM IN RUGBY SUPER LEAGUE WARRINGTON PRODUCED A STUNNING COMEBACK TO BEAT SALFORD BY THIRTY ONE POINTS TO THIRTY AND WORLD CHAMPION LEWIS HAMILTON HAS BLASTED FORMULA ONE AS BEING BROKEN AND LACKING DIRECTION AS IT STRUGGLES TO FINALISE RULES FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS HAMILTON HAS CRITICISED THE NEW HALO SAFETY SYSTEM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT DRIVERS' HEADS FROM IMPACT AND DEBRIS HAMILTON CALLED IT THE WORST LOOKING F.

TODAY'S RACING SELECTIONS MODIFICATION SORRY TO MAVIS RACING SELECTIONS DONCASTER THREE FIFTY NUMBER TWO KINGS BANNED IT AND NEWBURY FOR CLOCK NUMBER FIVE NITROGEN THAT'S IN THIS EVENING IT'S
THE RETURN OF THE NOW SHOW WITH HUGH DENNIS AND STEVE PUNT THE MET OFFICE HIS CHOICE OF NAMES FOR U.K. STORMS OVER FRANK GERTRUDE HENRY IMOGEN AND JAKE IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO KNOW IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO A WEATHER FORECAST ALL MORNING REGISTER AT A MIDDLE CLASS BOY
PROBLEM WITH NAMING WEATHER REALLY IS THAT IT WOULD RISK TURNING THE SHIPPING FORECAST WHICH ALREADY SOUNDS LIKE A SAMUEL BECKETT MONOLOGUE INTO FULL SCALE SURREALISM THAMES DOVER WIGHT PORTLAND BRIAN
SERIES OF THE NOW SHOW THIS EVENING AT HALF PAST SIX AND THEN AVAILABLE ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE WEATHER RAIN SLEET AND HILL SNOW ACROSS CENTRAL PARTS WILL GRADUALLY SINK SOUTH SINKS SOUTH AND THESE AS WELL DURING THE DAY THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COLD
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR THE JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS NOW FROM CAROLINE NICHOLLS THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS STRONGLY ATTACKED THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.K. TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SAYING THE ACRIMONIOUS MANNER IN WHICH IT'S BEING CONDUCTED COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE DATE OF THE REFERENDUM BUT IN THE DAILY MAIL HE SAID THE CAMPAIGN'S QUESTIONABLE ASSERTIONS COULD UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING SUCH CLAIMS
DONALD TRUMP THE FRONTRUNNER TO BECOME THE REPUBLICANS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN THE U.S. HAS COME UNDER A FIERCE ATTACK BY HIS RIVAL'S DURING THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE SO IT TED CRUISE AND MARCO RUBIO CRITICISED THE BILLIONAIRES CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS AND HE'S CHANGING POLICIES MY TRUMP ADMITTED THAT HE'D ALTERED HIS POSITION ON SOME ISSUES BUT SAID FLEXIBILITY IT WAS A STRENGTH
BRITISH SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THEY HAD DEVELOPED A WAY TO STEER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL CANCERS RESEARCHERS FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON THINK THEY FOUND A WAY TO TARGET UNIQUE MARKINGS WITHIN A TUMOUR BUT THE APPROACH WOULD BE EXPENSIVE POSSIBLY REQUIRING BESPOKE VACCINES FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND HAS NOT YET BEEN TRIED IN PATIENTS
STATE MEDIA IN PYONGYANG SAYS NORTH KOREA'S LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS SAID THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPON SHOULD BE READY FOR USE AT ANY TIME HE ALSO REPORTEDLY ORDERED THAT NORTH KOREA'S MILITARY POSTURE BE REVISED TO BE READY TO LAUNCH BRENT OF STRIKES ANALYSTS SAY IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE COUNTRY'S WEAPONS PROGRAMME IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO LAUNCH NUCLEAR WARHEADS ON MISSILES
SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES SAY A VACCINE FOR THE SEEKER VIRUS COULD BE READY FOR HUMAN TRIALS BY AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER ZEKE UP WHICH IS SPREAD BY MOSQUITOS HAS BEEN LINKED TO BIRTH DEFECTS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AMERICA SCIENTISTS DON'T EXPECT A VACCINE TO BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN
BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS AGREED TO PAY AN UNDISCLOSED AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION TO CHILDREN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ABUSED BY ONE OF ITS PILOTS DOING VOLUNTARY WORK IN KENYA AND UGANDA B.A. SAID IT WAS HORRIFIED BY WHAT SIMON WOULD HAVE DONE ALTHOUGH IT DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY WOULD TOOK HIS OWN LIFE THREE YEARS AGO
THE TIME IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO WELL WE KNEW THAT THE EURO REFERENDA EUROPEAN REFERENDUM DEBATE WOULD GET PRETTY HEATED AS TIME WENT BY PERHAPS WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BECOME AS HEATED AS IT HAS BECOME PRETTY POISONOUS IN FACT IAN DUNCAN SMITH WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF ONCE
THE QUIET MAN OF BRITISH POLITICS AS RULED HIS ARTILLERY UP DOWNING STREET AND BLASTED AWAY AT THE INHABITANTS OF IT HE'S WRITTEN A PIECE IN THE MAIL THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN TO STAY IN BEING CHARACTERISED BY SPIN SMEARS AND THREATS HE'S TALKED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING DESPERATE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE FUTURE THE HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE DOS YEARS
THAT ARE MAKING THE ROUNDS AND THE WHOLE FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT AFTER THE REFERENDUM WELL LET'S PUT SOME OF THAT TO ANOTHER LEADING OUTER IF THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DESCRIBE HIM AS DOCTOR LIAM FOX FORMER CABINET MINISTER HIMSELF OF COURSE AND HE IS IN BUILT IN EDINBURGH THIS MORNING THERE FOR RATHER DIFFERENT REASONS THOUGH CONNECTED TO THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE RATHER DIFFERENT REASONS IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
WELL I THINK THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS IN A POSITION WHERE WE WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TOGETHER TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AFTER THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE AND WE
THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE WILL FACE IS THAT IF THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN RAMPED UP TOO MUCH IN THAT INITIAL PERIOD AT THAT WILL BECOME HARDER FOR US HOW EASY OR HOW HARD IT IS FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AND GOVERN THIS COUNTRY AS THE MAJORITY PARTY IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR RESPECT WITH WHICH WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM WELL IN THAT CASE WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TREATING ONE ANOTHER WITH RESPECT
I THINK THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM HERE IN THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN RATHER THAN MAKING A POSITIVE CASE FOR WHAT THEY CALLED THE EUROPEAN PROJECT RATHER THAN MAKING THE CASE FOR SUPER NATIONALISM FOR THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF EVER CLOSER UNION WHICH IS WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ABOUT HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF LEAVING AND INCREASINGLY THE MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT THAT WE REALLY COULDN'T COPE ON OUR OWN AND WE CAN ONLY MANAGE BECAUSE OF THE HELP THE EUROPEAN UNION GIVES US AND THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUPPOSEDLY A GREATEST PARTNER SIGN OUR GREATEST FRIENDS ARE DESPERATE FOR US TO STAY IN THE E.U. WOULD TURN INTO OUR GREATEST ENEMIES WISHING NOTHING BUT MAL AS FAR AS WE ARE TO LEAVE THERE IS ANOTHER INTERPRETATION OF COURSE OF ALL OF THAT ISN'T THERE AND THAT IS THAT IF THEY BELIEVE AS WE MUST ASSUME THEY DO GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS RISKS ATTACHED TO LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THEY WOULD ARGUE WAS DONE AS PRETTY PROUD FOR THE LAST
MANY MANY MANY YEARS THEY WOULD BE IT WOULD BE WRONG OF THEM NOT TO MAKE THAT CASE HELP WHAT WHAT ELSE CAN THEY DO BUT TO MAKE THEIR CASE AND IF YOU THEN INTERPRET THAT AS A VICIOUS ATTACK ON ALL OF YOU WELL SO BEARD BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
IT'S THE PHRASES SUCH AS THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES THE SORT OF WELL SPELT OUT HE'LL SPELT OUT THE YVETTE THAT'S EXACTLY IT IS VERY ILL SPELT OUT SORT OF SINISTER THREATS LET'S SEE WHAT THE MORE SINISTER ABOUT SAY THERE'D BE CONSEQUENCES OF LEAVING INSTITUTION THAT WE'VE BEEN IN SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT BEHIND PROJECT FEAR IS THAT HAS TO BE CREDIBLE YOU'RE CALLING A PROJECT FEAR YOU SEE THAT'S THE WHOLE THING
THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT'S THERE TO DESI FINDING OUT RISKS WERE WELL THEN LET'S HAVE THEM BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE SOME INCREDIBLE STORIES TO HAVE SOME CREDIBLE STATISTICS ON THE SORT OF CASE AS WE'VE HAD THAT YOU'LL NOT GET CHEAP FLIGHTS CHILDREN'S BOOKS WOULDN'T GET PUBLISHED YOU'LL NOT BE ABLE TO BE RESCUED IF YOU'RE STRANDED ABROAD LISTEN
THAT LAST ONE WAS A NEW AND ON THE BUT BUT ANYWHERE WE GET RESCUED FROM AMERICA OR CHINA I CAN'T RECALL ANY ANYWAY THERE WE ARE LOOK THE THING IS IT'S YOUR OBVIOUSLY THIS IS OBVIOUSLY BECOME A PRETTY VICIOUS CAMPAIGN THE QUESTION HAS TO BE OURS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONSEQUENCES ARE YOU SUGGESTING IS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HEALING SUGGESTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE UNWORKABLE AFTER THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE SO MUCH BAD BLOOD WILL HAVE BEEN SPILT
WELL NOT UNWORKABLE AND BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S AT ALL POINTS WE STILL WE NEED TO SAY LET'S MAKE THE ARGUMENTS IN A RESPONSIBLE REASONABLE WAY LET'S NOT MAKE THEM IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE OUR OWN LIVES MORE DIFFICULT AFTERWARDS THE COUNTRY WILL REQUIRE GOVERNMENT THE CONSERVATIVES WILL BE THE MAJORITY PARTY WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE OUR OWN LIVES MORE DIFFICULT IS IT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR THE PRIME MINISTER TO STAY ON AFTER IT COME WHAT MAY
YES AND CONSTITUTIONALLY OF COURSE OF CONSTITUTIONALLY YES BUT IN REALITY YOU HAVE SO MUCH AS I SAID EARLIER SO MUCH BAD BLOOD OR HAVING BEEN SPILT IS IT REALLY GOING TO BE POSSIBLE IF YOU'VE ACCUSED A MAN BY IMPLICATION OF NOT HAVING INTEGRITY OF MAKING UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE DOSSIER SPOONS MUSE THREAT AND SO ON AND THE PRIME MINISTER THIS IS HIS CAMPAIGN WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE CAN YOU REALLY SIT OPPOSITE HIM AT THE CABINET TABLE AND PRETEND NOTHING'S HAPPENED
I'VE BEEN SEEING FOR A LONG TIME TO MY COLLEAGUES THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BINARY NATURE OF A REFERENDUM AND THE FACT IT WILL AROUSE A LOT OF PASSIONS IN FACT I'D SAID TO A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES IN A REFERENDUM FRIENDSHIPS GET TESTED RELATIONSHIPS CAN SARA
THAT'S ALWAYS THE RISK WHEN YOU GET INTO A REFERENDUM ESPECIALLY ON SOMETHING AS PASSIONATE AS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BRITAIN'S FUTURE CONTROL ITS OWN DESTINY WE SIMPLY HAVE TO BE GROWN UP ABOUT THAT AND WHEN WE COME BACK AFTER THE REFERENDUM RECOGNISE THAT THE ISSUE WILL HAVE BEEN SETTLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT DO YOU THINK MISTER CAMERON WAS AWARE OF THIS WHEN HE EMBARKED ON THIS ROAD
HOW NASTY IT WOULD BECOME A PLEASANT UNPLEASANT IT WOULD BECOME WELL I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE NO ONE CAN LOOK AT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND SAY THAT IT HASN'T HAD A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE OF VIEW ON EUROPE AND WE'VE KNOWN IN THE PAST HOW HER PASSIONATE THAT CAN BECOME I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THING
BUT WE JUST NEED TO NOT ALLOW THAT PASSION IN THE DEBATE OVER BRITAIN'S FUTURE TO SPILL INTO A PERSONAL RELATIONS THAT IS IS UNHELPFUL FOR US ALL IN THE LONGER TERM HE IS SORT OF FIGHTING FOR HIS POLITICAL LIFE REALLY ISN'T MY CAMERA WELL I DON'T SEE IT IN TERMS OF PERSONALITIES I SEE THERE'S INTEL OR BRITAIN TICKS IS ABOUT PERSONALITIES WELL ACTUALLY I DON'T
I DON'T ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT JOHN I THINK THAT WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE HERE IS BRITAIN'S ABILITY TO CONTROL ITS OWN FUTURE THAT FROM IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY POLITICIANS MYSELF INCLUDED JUST A VERY QUICK QUESTION IF YOU WOULD ER HOME BECAUSE THAT'S RATHER OVERTOOK THE REASON ORIGINALLY GOING TO INTERVIEW AND THAT IS THE SCOTS DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE AS A RESULT OF WHAT'S GOING ON DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE A SECOND SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM
NO AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT FOLLOWS THAT OVAL EVEN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD TRIGGER ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND AND WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE SCOTTISH SOCIAL ATTITUDES YOU SEE SCOTLAND'S ALSO BECOMING MORE EURO SCEPTIC I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT NICOLA STURGEON IN THE S.N.P. A SABRE RATTLING IT SUITS THEM IN THE RUN UP TO THE SCOTTISH ELECTIONS TO MAKE THREATS TO LONDON
BUT I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED YOU AND SCOTLAND AND WHAT I'M PICKING UP FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THAT THEY'VE GOT A BIT OF A FATIGUE SYNDROME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS CONSTANT QUESTION OF INDEPENDENCE AND FOR PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK UP THE UNION THEY NEED TO CONSIDER ONE THING WHICH IS THE NATIONALIST LATER
FOR THAT INDEPENDENCE CONCEPT AND THOSE WHO TAKE THAT DECISION TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BECAUSE THE RETREAT OF THE S.N.P. MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES TIED INTO EVER CLOSER UNION AND STILL FACING ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN IT SUITS THE S.N.P. THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS LIAM FOX LIKE SO MUCH
AND AT NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TO THE PAPERS AND THERE'S COMMENTS IN THE FRENCH PRESIDENT ABOUT THERE BEING CONSEQUENCES FOR THE U.K. EFFORT VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. ARE PRETTY WIDELY REPORTED THE TIMES THE INDEPENDENT BELIEVE THE INTERVENTION PROVIDED A BOOST FOR DAVID CAMERON IS FACING FIERCE OPPOSITION FROM ANY OF HIS OWN M.P.S OVER THE ISSUE OF BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP IN THE GUARDIAN THE CABINET MINISTER CHRIS GRAYLING IS IN FAVOUR OF BRITISH EXIT DESCRIBES THE COMMENTS AS DESPERATE
AND AS WE'VE JUST HEARD WRITING THE DAILY MAIL THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IN DUNCAN SMITH SAYS BIG BUSINESS IS BIG BANKS POWERFUL POLITICIAN FROM OTHER E.U. MEMBER STATES ARE SEEKING TO BULLY THE BRITISH PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEIR JOBS AND SECURITY AT RISK THEN MIRROR SAYS CAMPAIGNERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U. SUFFER A SERIOUS LACK OF SELF AWARENESS WHEN THEY YELL THAT STAYING IN WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC THEN ACCUSE THE OTHER SIDE OF SCAMMER
THE WHITE HOUSE RACE GETS NASTY THAT IS HEARD EXPRESSED DESCRIBES THE ATTACK ON THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION DONALD TRUMP BY THE FORMER NOMINEE MITT ROMNEY IT SAYS MY WRONGLY ACCUSED A BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN A BULLYING MISOGYNY AND DISHONESTY FINANCIAL TIMES HAS THE RARE AND VICIOUS PUBLIC ATTACK REFLECTS THE PANIC IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OVER THE RISE OF MISTER TRUMP AND HIS POPULIST ANTI ESTABLISHMENT CAMPAIGN
THE GUARDIAN'S FRONT PAGES DOMINATED BY A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE HONDURAN CAMPAIGNER BETTER CARACAS WHO'S BEEN MURDERED DAYS AFTER RECEIVING DEATH THREATS FOR OPPOSING A HYDRO ELECTRIC DAM PROJECT THE PAPER SAYS SHE WAS SHOT DEAD BY GUNMEN WHO ENTERED OUR HOUSE IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RECEIVING POLICE PROTECTION AND HE QUOTES THE GROUP GLOBAL WITNESS ARE SAYING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED ACTIVISTS WERE KILLED IN HONDURAS IN THE FOUR YEARS TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT'S A HIGHER DEATH TOLL RELATIVE TO POPULATION THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
THE TIMES REPORTS A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER SMILING QUEEN THAT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM APPEARS TO HAVE SECURED HIS PLACE IN ENGLISH SPORTING CULTURE AFTER THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF RUGBY AND FOOTBALL CAME OUT AGAINST PLANS TO REPLACE IT THE LABOUR M.P. TONY PERKINS HAD PUT FORWARD PROPOSALS FOR A SPECIFICALLY ENGLISH ANTHEM SUCH AS LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY
TO BE SUNG AT SPORTING EVENTS BUT THE TIME SAYS THE IDEA DESERVES SERIOUS CONSIDERATION DESCRIBES GOD SAVE THE QUEEN AS A PLODDING DIRGE WHICH HAS ENDURED RATHER THAN LUCK SEVENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT RICHARD GEARS LATEST FILM COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER FILMS THAT WHAT REALLY MADE HIS NAME PRETTY WOMAN AMERICAN GIGOLO ET-CETERA THAT TIME OUT OF MIND
THE TITLE OF HIS LATEST FILM HE PLAYS A HOMELESS MAN THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH PLOT HE TRIES TO RECREATE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SLEEP ROUGH IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT RICHARD GERE CALLS THE FILM AT ALL FOR SOCIAL CHANGE HE'S SHOWN IT TO POLITICIANS HE'S SHOWN IT TO POLICY MAKERS IN CITIES ACROSS AMERICA LAST WEEK HE WAS DOING IN GLASGOW HE'S IN LONDON TODAY THE FILM OPENS HERE TONIGHT AND SARAH HAS BEEN TALKING TO
THE IDEA OF HOMELESSNESS IS ATTACHED TO THE IDEA OF IDENTITY ITSELF
AS IS WHO ARE YOU WHAT WHAT A HUMAN BEINGS WERE WERE SOCIAL BEINGS FOR SURE EVEN THOSE OF US THAT WANNA BE ALIVE WE STILL KIND OF PREFER THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WIRRAL
WHEE EVERYTHING ABOUT US IS POINTED TOWARDS FINDING A COMMUNITY THE THINGS WERE PRECIOUS IN SOMEWHERE
SO THE IDEA OF HOME TO ME IS THE PHYSICAL HARM BUT THERE IS THIS OTHER ONE THERE'S A DEEPER HUMAN IMPULSE
WHICH IS AN IDEA OF COMFORT AND SOMETHING THAT'S UNIVERSAL THAT'S DEEPER THAN ME DEEPER THAN YOU THAT IS REALLY COMMON TO ALL OF US
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU SAY LET'S TALK ABOUT LONDON BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT THE GREAT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE HERE BUT WHY NON SPECIFIC THINGS BUT THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM HERE HE'S GETTING WORSE AND THAT WHAT THE FILM SHOWS IS THERE IS NO ANSWERS I MEAN THERE ARE NO ANSWERS FOR THE MAN THAT YOU'RE PORTRAYING DRIFTING AROUND THE CITY BUT THERE WERE LIMITS BUREAUCRACY
WE PROBABLY WILL NEVER FIND IT THERE IT'S THIS THE SOLUTIONS ARE TWOFOLD AND IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE WE KNOW WHAT WORKS AND IT WORKS EVERYWHERE YOU'D HAVE WITH HOUSING HOUSING FIRST
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE THE WAY WERE BUILT AWAY OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BUILT AND SPIRITUALLY THERE WE ARE BUT WE NEED A PLACE THAT'S OURS AND THAT'S HOW WE START TO INTEGRATE IN IDEA OF SELF IDENTITY
AND THE OTHER THING WE NEED COMMUNITY WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE AROUND US O.K. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THE HOME AT HOMELESS SHELTERS MAKE THINGS WORSE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT A DATE FOR THE NIGHT THAT'S ALL THEY ARE AND THE TRUTH OF IT IS A LOT OF MY FRIENDS LIVE ON THE STREETS IN THE YORK WON'T GO TO THE SHELTERS THEY ARE AFRAID
IT'S GOING TO GET SHAKEN DOWN TO GET RIPPED OFF
INTIMIDATED IT'S SAFER FOR THEM THEY FEEL TO BE IN THE STREETS BUT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE TALKING ABOUT NOT LEAST THE CHARACTER IN THE FILM IS SOMEBODY WHO IS DAMAGED WHO IS A DRINKER
WHO DOESN'T DRINK YOU DRINK I MEAN WHO DOESN'T THIS IS AS WELL AN ALCOHOL IN A WAY THEIR OPPORTUNITY NOT THERE YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT THIS IS A WEED I DEFINITELY TOLD THE STORY ABOUT A GUY WHO WAS AN ACTING OUT HIS AND THE GUY'S A TROUBLE MAKER
AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE STREET WILL TOTALLY LOST IT AND THEY DON'T CARE ANY MORE AND THERE'S
EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL DAMAGE AND THEY WILL ACT OUT BUT THAT'S A CLICHE AND TO ME WAS INSULTING TO HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON STREETS AND THOSE WHO SAY DON'T GIVE MONEY TO SOMEBODY BEGGING ON THE STREET IT DOESN'T HELP THEM
IT WAS BEING STINGY TO REALITY IS COMPASSION IS A PART OF COMMUNITY THAT'S HOW WE'RE ALL RETRIEVABLE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY DO WITH THEM
WELL THERE ARE GOING TO LOOK THEY'LL SHOW US THIS IS MY POINT OF VIEW THE GENEROSITY FROM OUR SIDE AND GIVING IT HEALS US THEM UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A GENUINE ACT OF GENEROSITY
IT'S NOT UP TO US TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THAT MONEY AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO SPEND IT ON DRUGS OR DRINK THE COMPASSIONATE MOMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW YOU WILL BE AWARE THAT THERE'S ALMOST A BACKLASH AGAINST ACTORS WHO ARE PROMOTING HUMANITARIAN CAUSE DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF CYNICISM THAT SOME HAVE SHOWN IN RESPONSE TO SOME INDIVIDUALS DOING VARIOUS THINGS ARE PROMOTING CAUSES I DON'T KNOW
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED A SORT OF CYNICISM ABOUT
AND BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING AT ME LIKE COME OUT AGAIN THEY WORK WORKING ANY MORE I AM NOT DO YOU LIKE IT I THINK IT'S ABOUT IT'S CALLED VIRTUE SIGNALLING WE SAW IT WHETHER IT'S ON TWITTER I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW I CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT THINGS I KNOW ABOUT AND HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT THINGS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT WOULD BE POINTLESS
I WISH YOU HAD SEEN THE LOOK SHE JUST GAVE ME A MAN WHO SARAH I THINK YOU'RE O.K. YOU'RE CLOSING IT DOWN ARE YOU TAKING THOSE IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO ME IT'S POINTLESS
BUT I WELL I SUPPOSE IN A WAY THE QUESTION IS WHERE THE EGG O.K. YOU MAKE A FILM ABOUT HOMELESS AND IT WOW IT'S A PLATFORM IN A RICHARD GERE THE CENTRAL FIGURE WE CAN IF YOU WANT TROUBLE AS YOU ARE I DID TWO THINGS WITH THIS I MADE A FILM NUMBER ONE THAT I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD
MY HOPE WAS THAT IF IT WAS A GOOD FILM I WOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT IN TERMS OF SOCIAL
AND THAT WAS HER AFFINITY WITH THAT WITH INTERVIEWING GETTING ON WELL WITH GETTING ON WELL WITH RICHARD GERE
THE TIME IS HER TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HAIR STUDIO THIS MORNING IS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE RESULTS OF THE IRANIAN ELECTIONS CAME IN THIS WEEK SHOWING SOME MODEST ADVANCES WITH MORE WOMEN ELECTED THAN EVER BEFORE
FOR ME IT BROUGHT BACK THE MEMORY OF A YOUNG GIRL I MET IN IRAN A FEW YEARS AGO
MY WIFE AND I WERE ON HOLIDAY AND WHEN WE FLEW INTO CHARADES AIRPORT THERE WAS A CROWD OF YOUNG TEENAGE GIRLS WANTING TO SPEAK TO PASSENGERS COMING OFF THE AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR ENGLISH
ONE YOUNG GIRL CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED WHAT JOB I DID I'M A KIND OF CHRISTIAN IMAM I REPLIED TO WHICH APROPOS NOTHING SHE IMMEDIATELY SAID I DON'T THINK GOD IS A SHE DO YOU
TO WHICH I REPLIED I THINK THAT ALL WE MEAN BY HE AND SHE IS CONTAINED WITHIN GOD AT WHICH POINT SHE PREACH ME A LITTLE SIMON ATE ON THE THEME OF GOD IS LOVE ALL THIS FROM A YOUNG TEENAGE GIRL TO A STRANGER AT THE AIRPORT IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE EVEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT SHE HAS IS THE CITY OF SUFI MYSTICISM IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ENCOUNTERS I'VE EVER HAD
I'M OPPOSED TO GENDER STEREOTYPES WHICH CAN BE SO FALSE AND MISLEADING BUT I'D STILL REPLY TO THAT GIRL AS I DID THEN ALL THAT WE THINK OF AS A GOOD MASCULINE OR GOOD FEMININE QUALITIES ARE IN GOD
AND ONE OF THE IMAGES THE CHURCH ARE TRADITIONALLY USE THIS COMING SUNDAY IS THE MOTHERING OF GOD OF COURSE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOW IT IS JUST MARVELLOUS DAY AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION OF HER OWN MOTHER AND IMPORTANT AND WONDERFUL THING TO DO BUT IT IS ALSO MOTHERING SUNDAY
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT GOT THAT NAME IS BECAUSE IN THE EPISTLE FOR THE FOURTH SUNDAY IN LENT IN THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER A BOOK WHICH SO DECISIVELY SHAPED OUR CULTURE AND RELIGION FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WE READ BUT JERUSALEM WHICH IS ABOVE HIS FREE WHICH IS THE MOTHER OF US ALL
JERUSALEM IN CHRISTIAN TAUGHT IS A HEAVENLY HOME A LIFE IN GOD WHERE WE TRULY BELONG NOT JUST AFTER DEATH WOULD NOW AND THIS IS THE RATHER BRIGHTER IS A MOTHER NURTURING AND CARING FOR US
A NUMBER OF IMAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH DRAW OUT THE FEMININE SIDE OF DIVINE LOVE IT SAYS OF ETERNAL WISDOM FOR EXAMPLE SHE IS THE BREATH OF OF THE POWER OF GOD IN EVERY GENERATION SHE PASSES INTO HOLY SOULS AND MAKES THEM FRIENDS OF GOD AND JESUS IS RECORDED AS SAYING HOW OFTEN I HAVE LONG TO GATHER YOUR CHILDREN AS A HEN GATHERS HER BROOD UNDER HER WINGS
AND I KNOW THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE OF THEIR OWN FATHER AND A GOOD ONE OF THEIR MOTHER SUCH IMAGES CAN BE HUGELY IMPORTANT
AND MOTHER'S DAY CAN BE TIME NOT ONLY FOR EXPRESSING APPRECIATION OF OUR OWN MOTHER BUT REFLECTING ON SOMETHING OF THE DIVINE LOVE HAS BEEN CHANNELLED THROUGH HUMAN MOTHERHOOD
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH LORD HARRY'S THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT USED TO BE THE CASE THAT IF YOU WANTED TO SAVE ELECTRICITY SWITCH THE LIGHTS OFF AND THAT WAS IT THAT SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD THIS MORNING THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT COMPLEXITY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION THE GOVERNMENT SET UP TO ADVISE US ON THE BIG STUFF THAT KEEPS THE COUNTRY RUNNING WELL THEY'RE TELLING US THAT WE COULD USE ELECTRICITY
VERY DIFFERENTLY AND BY DOING THAT WE COULD USE LESS OF IT WE COULD SAVE MONEY EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND OF COURSE THEY ARE TELLING US THAT AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY WERE CLOSING DOWN POWER STATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE NOT AT THE MOMENT OPENING NEW ONES WITH ANY
SPEED OR LORD ADONIS FORMER LABOUR TRANSPORT SECRETARY IS CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TELL US THE PLAN TO PAINT US A PICTURE OF WHERE YOU WANT US TO GET TO ON STORAGE THERE'S A BIG DEBATE ABOUT YOU GENERATING CAPACITY AND WE NEED A LOT MORE OF IT AS OUR POWER STATIONS CLOSE OVER THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS BUT THE REPORT THAT WE PUBLISHED TODAY LOOKS AT OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENTS HOW YOU MANAGE DEMANDS AND HOW YOU REDUCE THE NEED FOR NEW GENERATING CAPACITY
BY BOOSTING INTER CONNECTION WITH EUROPEAN MARKETS THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR IMPORTING MORE ENERGY FROM NORWAY ICELAND DENMARK OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE WHERE IT'S GREEN AND OFTEN CHEAPER THAN IT IS HERE WE'VE GOT FOUR INCH CONNECTORS AS THEY'RE CALLED AT THE MOMENT THERE COULD BE A LOT MORE AND WE NEED POLICY TO ENCOURAGE THAT AND WE'RE JUST IN THE EARLY STAGES OF BEING ABLE TO STORE ELECTRICITY IN A SERIOUS WAY OR WHAT IS THE COLOUR SAY THEY'D ENCOURAGES THAT WAS ONLY OTHER CHANGES THAT YOU WON'T COS THAT'S THE CRUCIAL BIT ISN'T IT AND THAT'S THAT
BUT HE'S GETTING PEOPLE TO DO IT YOU'RE ASSUMING EITHER THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING TO BE SPENDING HIS OWN MONEY ILLNESS OR IN TERMS OF INTER CONNECTION ACROSS THE COUPLE HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY BECAUSE THESE ARE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND DAVID CAMERON WAS IN ICELAND RECENTLY AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGING THE IDEA OF YOU COULD HAVE AN INTER CONNECTOR
ICELAND WHERE YOU'VE GOT GEO THERMAL AND HYDRO POWERED WHO PAYS IN THE KIT THE COURSE THIS WOULD THEN BE COMMERCIAL PROPOSITIONS AND THEN HE'LL BE PAID FOR BY CONSUMERS BUT IF THE ENERGY WHICH YOU'RE IMPORTING IS CHEAPER AND OF COURSE WE HAVE OFFSHORE WIND FARMS COULD BE THAT THESE INTO AS COULD ALLOW ENERGY TO GO THE OTHER WAY TO WIN WE'VE GOT A SURPLUS
THEN THERE'S MET BENEFITS TO U.K. CONSUMERS AND GETTING THIS BALANCE RIGHT BETWEEN PUTTING NEW GENERATING CAPACITY IN PLACE WITHIN THE U.K. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY VITAL AS EXISTING POWER STATIONS CLOSE BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN AVOID NEEDING TO BUILD OUR OWN DOMESTIC GENERATING CAPACITY BUT THROUGHT STORAGE THROUGH INTER CONNECTION AND THROUGH BETTER DEMAND MANAGEMENT WHICH OF COURSE WHEN SMART METERS BECOME THE NORM IS MUCH MUCH EASIER TO DO ALL OF THAT COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR THE GENERATING CAPACITY
BEING BIG SAVINGS FOR CONSUMERS THERE WORKED ON TRUST BY IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON SUGGEST IF YOU GET THIS BALANCE BETTER BETWEEN YOU GENERATING CAPACITY AND MANAGING DEMAND AN INTER CONNECTING WITH EUROPEAN SUPPLIES THAT THIS COULD BUY TWENTY THIRTY BUT EQUIVALENT ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS A HOUSEHOLD EIGHT BILLION A YEAR SO IT'S BIG IT'S BIG MONEY AND IT NEEDS TO FEATURE IN A POLICY DEBATE OVER OVER THE PERIOD AHEAD DO YOU AGREE WITH M.P.S WHO WERE REPORTING ANY YESTERDAY THAT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S ENERGY INTENTIONS WERE
HE'S MAKING ELECTRICITY AMOR EXPENSIVE THE JUST PERSUADING PEOPLE NOT TO BUILD THE KIND OF INVESTMENT NOT TO TOUCH TO BRING TO BORE BEAR THE KIND OF MONEY THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR IF ALL OF THESE THINGS GOING TO BE DONE
PART OF THE REASON FOR HAVING THE COMMISSION WHICH WHICH I CHAIR IS IS TO TRY AND GIVE A MUCH STRONGER AND CLEARER STEER WHEN IT COMES INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT SO WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THE KIND IN THE CLUB IN THE IN THE AREAS WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT WHICH OF THESE DEMAND MANAGEMENT STORAGE INTERCONNECTION AREAS WE'VE BEEN QUICK WE'RE GETTING A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE REGULATORS AND THE GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO GET ON WITH IT BUT WE NEED MORE INTERCONNECT AS WE NEED THEM SOON
WE NEED THE DIPLOMATS TO GET GOING ON MAKING THE ATHLETE THESE POSSIBLE IN IN TERMS OF RELATIONS WELL I THINK YOUR PINK ROWNTREE'S WE NEED THE REGULATOR TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE PROVIDING BIG STORAGE FACILITIES TO DO SO SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT ALONGSIDE GENERATORS WHICH ISN'T THE CASE AT THE MOMENT AND WE NEED TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE DEMAND MANAGEMENT SO SETTING A POLICY CONTACT IS IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT SEEKING TO DO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING IN PLACE
NEW GENERATING CAPACITY AS WELL AND THAT BRINGS US REALLY TO SUPPLY DOESN'T IT AS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE M.P.S ARE SAYING IS THAT BEEN CUTS TO AND THAT THIS SUBSIDY RENEWABLES THAT PUTS OR ALL OF THIS INTO QUESTION ABOUT THE ABILITY OF PRODUCES TWO OF INVESTORS TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK AT MENTIONED G. AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH HINKLEY SAVES PAR STATION NUCLEAR POWER STATION WHICH WAS MEANT TO BE COMING ON STREAM PRETTY SOON WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT ON DID DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
THE ENERGY PICTURE RICK LA LARGE DO YOU FEEL THAT WE THE GOVERNMENT ALL OF US ARE GETTING IT RIGHT
THE GRID ASSURES US THAT IN TERMS OF HAVE SEEN WE GET BLACK OUTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE COVERED AND THAT THEY HAVE GOT THE CAPACITY IN PLACE TO SEE THAT WE CAN MEET WE MEET MEET OUR NEEDS BUT DO WE NEED CERTAINTY OF POLICY IN THE PERIOD AHEAD TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT AND THAT TO SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE
THE STOP GO THAT AS CHARACTERISE THINGS IN THE PAST WE DEFINITELY MUST ADJUST THE STOCK AS THEY SAY IS MEANT TO BE PROVIDING SEVEN PER CENT OF OUR PA IT'S BY NO MEANS CERTAIN IS IT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT DO YOU THINK WE NEED A PLAN B. IN CASE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS IS PURSUING HINCKLEY VIGOROUSLY AND THEY NEED TO DO SO BUT DO YOU THINK THEY NEED TO PRESS PURSUE OTHER THINGS AS WELL COS THE SUGGESTIONS THEY'RE NOT PURSUING RENEWABLES WELL BUT THEY ARE WITH A BIGGER GRAHAM THE FIGURE THERE WAS A BIG INCREASE IN AND IT WAS GOING ON TO IT'S NOT THE CASE AT THIS IS EITHER OR
BUT WE DO NEED A BASE LOAD NUCLEAR CAPACITY TO AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKE TWO TO PURSUE THAT AND THEY NEED TO DO THAT CONSISTENTLY TO SEE THAT WE DO GET THE SUPPLY IN PLACE BUT THEY ALSO NEED THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE COMMISSION THIS MORNING THE THE SMART POWER THE INTERCONNECTIONS STORAGE THE DEMAND MANAGEMENT THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE PURSUED CONSISTENTLY AND IT'S CONSISTENT POLICY THAT WILL ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT AND WILL SEE THAT WE HAVE THE ENERGY SUPPLIES THAT WE NEED AT THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE FOR CONSUMERS NOT DENNIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE WEATHER FORECAST PHIL
JOHN THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED NORTHERN ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE NORTH OF WALES THE NORTH AND WEST MIDLANDS MUCH OF WALES AND THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND OVERNIGHT THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF RAIN OR SNOW FROM QUITE AN ACTIVE WEATHER FRONT ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND THE NORTH OF WALES AND THE NORTH OF ENGLAND A DISRUPTION ALREADY THERE TO BE HAD AND UNFORTUNATELY

CLIVE LEWIS SHADOW ENERGY MINISTER WHO DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A PROUD SOCIALIST MARK LITTLEWOOD DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE FREE MARKET THINK TANK THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND JACOB REES MOGG CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHER RENOWNED INTER ALIA FOR FAVOURING THE USE OF LATIN AND HIS PARLIAMENTARY SPEECHES AND FOR HIS SARTORIAL TASTE HE SAYS HE DOESN'T SLEEP IN DOUBLE BREASTED PYJAMAS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO GET THEM
HE WILL OUT BE DOUBLE BREASTED BUT SINGLE MINDED AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS EVENING SPEAKING WHICH I'M GOING TO GET DRESSED I THOUGHT IT'S JONATHAN FROM HERE HE'S IN PYJAMAS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FORWARD JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE FOURTH OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS WARNED THAT CAMPAIGNERS FOR BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE Y. YOU ARE USING TACTICS THAT COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE REFERENDUM
DONALD TRUMP HAS FACED A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM FROM HIS MAIN RIVALS IN THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST BRITISH SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'D MADE AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY ABOUT CANCER CELLS WHICH THEY HOPE WILL LEAD TO A RANGE OF NEW TREATMENTS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TOLD HE COULD SAVE BILLIONS OF POUNDS IF HE'D USED ELECTRICITY MORE WISELY TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CAROLINE NICHOLS
THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS LAUNCHED HIS STRONGEST ATTACK YET ON THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR THE U.K. TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SUGGESTING THERE SMEARS AND THREATS COULD CAUSE LASTING DAMAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT BITING IN THE DAILY MAIL HE STOP SHORT OF ANY DIRECT CRITICISM OF DAVID CAMERON BUT HE SAYS THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE MAKING SUCH CLAIMS COULD BE UNDERMINED IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC HE'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
IAIN DUNCAN SMITH ARTICULATES THE FURY AMONGST THOSE WANTING TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT ON FROM THE COMPLETION OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S DEAL IN BRUSSELS THOSE WANTING TO STAY IN THE YOU NO LONGER TALK MUCH ABOUT THAT BUT INSTEAD FOCUS ON WHAT HE CALLS THE DESPERATE AND UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH LEAVING MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S LANGUAGE IS EMOTIVE THERE HAVE HE SAYS IN A SERIES OF HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE DOSSIERS
THREATENING ALMOST BIBLICAL CONSEQUENCES IF WE DARE TO CONSIDER HER FUTURE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION HE RACES TO A POLITICAL REALITY FOR DOWNING STREET WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM A SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL FIND ITSELF BRUISED AND DEFEATED
HE FEARS WHAT HE CALLS THE ACRIMONIOUS MANNER IN WHICH THE DEBATE HAS BEEN CONDUCTED SO FAR WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES A POINT ECHOED ON THIS PROGRAMME BY FELLOW LEAF CAMPAIGNER AND FORMER CABINET MINISTER LIAM FOX
WE WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TOGETHER TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AFTER THE TWENTY FOURTH OF JUNE IF THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN RAMPED UP TOO MUCH OF THAT WILL BECOME HARDER FOR US HOW EASY OR HOW HARD IT IS FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AND GOVERN THIS COUNTRY AS THE MAJORITY PARTY IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER AND THEIR RESPECT WITH WHICH WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM
BOTH NUMBER TEN AND THE BRITAIN STRONGER IN EUROPE CAMPAIGN HAVE DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS DONALD TRUMP HAS EXCHANGED BLOWS WITH TWO OF HIS MAIN RIVALS IN THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE THE TYCOON WHO'S FACED A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM FROM SENIOR PARTY FIGURES WAS ACCUSED BY TED CREWS ARE FUNDING HILLARY CLINTON'S DEMOCRATIC ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND MARCO RUBIO'S SAID MISTER TRUMP DESERVE TO BE ATTACKED PERSONALLY BECAUSE HE'D MOCKED EVERYBODY FROM WASHINGTON HE'S LAURA BICKER
DONALD TRUMP IS UNDER ATTACK THE PAST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES MITT ROMNEY AND JOHN MCCAIN CALLED HIM UNFIT FOR OFFICE AND A DANGER TO THE NATION THE BILLIONAIRE TOOK A MOMENT AT THE START OF THE DEBATE TO HIT
WELL LOOK HE WAS A FAILED CANDIDATE HE SHOULD'VE BEATEN PRESIDENT OBAMA VERY
THERE WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO WHAT OR WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE AWAY ON A VACATION THE LESS BUT HIS RIVAL'S SENATORS TED CRUISE AND MICHAEL REPEAL CRITICISED THE BILLIONAIRES CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALS HE'S CHANGING POLICIES AND HIS FAILED BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE INTERNET BASED TRUMP UNIVERSITY WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF A CIVIL LAWSUIT
HE'S TRYING TO DO TO THE AMERICAN VOTER WHAT HE DID TO THE PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP FOR THE SPORT
I DON'T WANT IT HE GOT IT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT'S A COUNTRY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE THERE WERE A FEW MOMENTS OF LEVITY AMIDST THE MUD SLINGING AT ONE POINT TED CRUISE POKED FUN AT THE BUSINESSMAN URGING HIM TO BREATHE
BUT IT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH IS GASPING FOR ANSWERS MANY WANT TO STOP HIM WINNING THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION THEY'RE UNSURE JUST HOW TO GO ABOUT IT
BRITISH SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED A WAY TO GUIDE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL CANCERS IN WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN EXCITING ADVANCE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE WRITING IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE THE TEAMS SUGGEST THAT THEIR METHOD COULD BE USED TO FIND UNIQUE FEATURES WITHIN THE CANCER TUMOUR HELPING THE BODY'S OWN DEFENCES TO TARGET THE DISEASED CELLS HERE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
THIS DETAILED WORK BY CANCER SCIENTISTS FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO HOW CELLS FROM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CALLED T. CELLS RECOGNISE SOME OF THE EARLIEST MUTATIONS IN THE CELLS OF TUMOURS THE HOPE IS THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN BE HARNESSED TO DEVELOP VACCINES WHICH WOULD STIR UP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND ATTACK PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE'S CANCERS
CANCER RESEARCH U.K. WHICH FUNDED THE WORK SAYS THE NEXT STAGE IN THE COMING YEARS IS TO BEGIN TRIALS OF VACCINES WHICH ACTIVATE THE T. CELLS OR EVEN TO HARVEST THE T. CELLS AND PUT THEM BACK INTO PATIENTS SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THIS COULD TARGET THE ACHILLES HEEL OF SOME HIGHLY COMPLEX FORMS OF THE DISEASE
BUT THIS THEORETICAL WORK HASN'T YET BEEN TRIED ON PATIENTS AND PERSONALISING MEDICINE IN THIS WAY WOULD PROVE EXPENSIVE SOME SCIENTISTS HAVE WORN TO THE WORK COULD PROVE DIFFICULT BECAUSE MANY CANCERS KEEP EVOLVING AND MIGHT THEREFORE PROVE COMPLEX TARGETS PROFESSOR PETER JOHNSON OF CANCER RESEARCH U.K. TOLD THIS PROGRAMME WHY IT COULD BE SUCH A MAJOR STEP FORWARD FROM CURRENT TREATMENTS
IT'S REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO GET THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STIRRED UP AGAINST SOMETHING RATHER GENERIC IT SEEMS TO BE THE PARTICULAR DANGER SIGNALS IN PARTICULAR CANCERS THAT GET SEEN BY INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE'S IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT CONSTITUTE BY FAR THE STRONGEST DANGER SIGNAL SO I THINK THAT THESE INDIVIDUALISED VACCINES MAY WELL TAKE US SEVERAL NOTCHES UP THE SCALE OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOU CAN MAKE THE IMMUNE RESPONSE
SCIENTISTS IN AMERICA BELIEVE AND ADVANCED VACCINE FOR THE ZEKE A VIRUS COULD BE READY FOR HUMAN TRIALS BY AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER THE RESEARCH HAS TAKEN PLACE AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN MARYLAND A GLOBAL HEALTH CORRESPONDENT TULIP WAS UNDER IT
THE SCIENTISTS IN THIS LAB HELPS DEVELOP AN ADVANCED VACCINE FOR A BOWLER DURING THAT OUTBREAK NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE SAME FOR ZEKE UP WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON PREGNANT WOMEN BECAUSE OF THE STRONGLY SUSPECTED LINK BETWEEN THE VIRUS AND BABIES BEING BORN WITH UNDERDEVELOPED BRAINS DOCTOR ANTHONY FOUND THE INSTITUTE'S DIRECTOR SAYS HE'S HOPING HUMAN CHILD WILL START IN AMERICA SOON WE WILL HAVE A VACCINE THAT'S READY TO GO INTO HUMANS TO TEST
TO DISTRIBUTE BUT TEST FOR SAFETY AND FOR WHERE THEY WERE IT INDUCES A RESPONSE THAT YOU WOULD PROJECT WOULD BE PROTECTED
THAT PHASE ONE TRIAL I BELIEVE WILL LIKE WE START TOWARDS THE END OF THE SUMMER OR EARLY FOR THESE PHASE ONE TRIALS ARE ONLY THE START OF A LONG PROCESS THE EARLIEST SCIENTISTS HERE EXPECT HAVE A VACCINE FOR MUCH WIDER DISTRIBUTION IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS ORDERED HIS MILITARY TO BE READY TO FIRE THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE STATE NEWS AGENCY IN PYONGYANG SAID HE'D ALSO DIRECTED THAT HIS FORCES BE CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING A PRE EMPTY OF STRIKE THE REMARKS FOLLOW NEW UNITED NATION SANCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO A NUCLEAR TEST AND ROCKET LAUNCH IN JANUARY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WARNED ABOUT A LOOMING SHORTAGE OF ACCOMMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS THE COMMONS HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAYS MINISTERS NEED TO ENCOURAGE MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PROVIDE SUITABLE HOUSING FOR THE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT PLANS TO RESETTLE HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
THE ASYLUM HOUSING SCHEME CAME UNDER SCRUTINY EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN IT EMERGED THAT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PROPERTIES IN MIDDLESBROUGH HAD RED DOORS AND SOME CLAIMANTS IN CARDIFF HAD TO WEAR COLOURED WRISTBANDS TO RECEIVE MALES THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SAID THE OPERATION OF THE ASYLUM ACCOMMODATION SCHEME WAS MOSTLY UNSATISFACTORY WITH THE COMPANIES CONTRACTED TO RUN IT G. FOUR S. SERCO AND CLEAR SPRINGS
STRUGGLING TO FIND ENOUGH PLACES THE COMMITTEE SAID TO PU LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE WILLING TO ALLOW ASYLUM SEEKERS TO BE PLACED IN THEIR AREA AND CALLED ON MINISTERS TO PERSUADE MORE TO DO SO THE HOME OFFICE SAID IT WAS ALREADY TRYING TO DO THAT
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN TOLD IT COULD SAVE EIGHT BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IF IT USED ELECTRICITY MORE WISELY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION HAS CALLED FOR AN ENERGY REVOLUTION TO IMPROVE THE WAY ELECTRICITY IS STORED AND USED IN THE U.K. JENNIFER BAXTER HEAD OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT AT THE INSTITUTE OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS TOLD US IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LOOK BEYOND TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF POWER
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE CAN START TO APPROACH TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN SOME POLICIES THAT SUGGEST THAT NEW NUCULAR AND COMBINED CYCLE GAS TURBINES ARE APPROPRIATE IN THEIR VIEW BOTH OF THESE ARE COSTLY AND CAN OFTEN TAKE A LONG TIME TO BUILD SO THERE IS A NEED NOW TO START LOOKING AT OTHER SOLUTIONS
THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION IS FACING CALLS TO ADOPT A MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING TO ENCOURAGE FORMER TEACHERS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM IN ENGLAND THE RESEARCH GROUP POLICY EXCHANGE SAYS MANY WOMEN WHO LEAVE TEACHING TO BRING UP CHILDREN COULD BE ATTRACTED BACK BY LESS RIGID WORKING PATTERNS HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE POLICY EXCHANGE SAID TEACHERS RETURNING FROM A PERIOD AWAY MADE UP A THIRD OF STATE SCHOOL RECRUITS EACH YEAR IT SAID SCHOOLS COULD RECRUIT MANY MORE FORMER TEACHERS WERE THEY TO OFFER MORE FLEXIBLE PATTERNS OF WORK THE REPORT SAID MANAGING TIMETABLES TO FIT WITH CHILDCARE AND PART TIME WORKING COULD BRING BACK TO THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS SUFFERING BURNOUT
AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF YOUNG WOMEN LEAVING TO START A FAMILY THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS WHICH COMMISSIONED THE RESEARCH SAID FLEXIBLE HOURS COULD ALLEVIATE A WIDESPREAD SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS
ROBERT PIGGOTT REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT
WHILE WORLD LEADERS AGONISE OVER HOW TO DEAL WITH THE REFUGEE CRISIS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STILL INSIDE SYRIA WHO WERE LEADING DESPERATE LIVES THE CEASEFIRE THERE BEGAN A WEEK AGO HE'S MORE OR LESS HOLDING BUT IT'S NOT HELPING THOSE AREAS THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY JIHADIS LIKE THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND THEY ARE STILL BEING HIT BY RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN WAR PLANES AND MISSILES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE LEADING WRETCHED LIVES IN A MOMENT I'LL BE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO IS REGARDED AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S AUTHORITIES ON COUNTER INSURGENCY BUT LET'S HEAR
FOR THE LAST TIME FROM A MAN WHO LIVES IN WRECKER WHICH IS THE CAPITAL OF THE AREA OR SYRIA HELD BY YES EVERY DAY THIS WEEK WE HAVE BROADCAST AN EXTRAORDINARY DIARY THAT HE'S WRITTEN DESCRIBING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE UNDER SUCH A MURDEROUS REGIME OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT USING HIS NAME AND HIS WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY AN ACTOR
THE SUN IS OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DAYS THE BRIGHTER WEATHER MAKES ME FEEL OPTIMISTIC I'M ABLE TO PUSH AWAY GLOOMY THOUGHTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS
BUT THE GOODS IN OUR SHOP ARE GETTING DUSTY THEY ARE JUST NOT SELLING THE COST OF GETTING THEM HERE THROUGH COMPLICITY DEMON DASH CHECKPOINTS HAS MADE THEM SO EXPENSIVE
WE SAID LISTEN TWO MONTHS ON DARKISH THEN WE DID IN ONE WEEK BEFORE AND THAT'S NOT ONLY DOWN TO SORTING PRICES MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T GO OUT ON THE STREETS ANY MORE TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE DASH WE SIMPLY ORDERED ALL SHOPKEEPERS TO LIMIT THEIR MARK UP ON GOODS TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND THE CHARGER STARTS ON THE TOP OF THAT
THEN THERE'S THE COST OF CLEANING AND ELECTRICITY WHEN WE CAN GET IT WE'RE BASICALLY MAKING A LOSS TRADERS ARE GIVING UP
WHILE THEY WORRY THE MOTHER OFF HER FRIEND I'M HER THROUGH THE GROUP COMES INTO THE SHOP HE WAS WITH US FROM THE START OF THE REVOLUTION BUT HE GAVE UP ALL ACTIVISM ONE DUTCH TOOK OVER GOT MARRIED AND SETTLED DOWN POOR GUY HE DIDN'T REALISE THAT THEY'D STILL COME UP TO HIM THAT SHE KNEW OF HIS PREVIOUS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REVOLUTION AND THEY ARRESTED HIM SEVERAL TIMES
HIS MOTHER LOOKS WORRIED AND IN DEEP DESPAIR I ASK HER WHAT'S WRONG SHE TELLS ME THAT THEY'VE ARRESTED HER SON IN A RAID ON HER HOME
I TRIED TO CALM HER DOWN SAYING THEY'RE PROBABLY ONLY QUESTIONING HIM LIKE THEY DID PLENTY OF TIMES BEFORE BUT SHE TAKES NO COMFORT AND TELLS ME TO LEAVE THE CITY BEFORE THEY GET TO ME TOO WORDS HAVE REALLY GOT TO ME I WALK AROUND THE CITY WITH A BROKEN SOUL LOOKING AT ALL OTHER BROKEN SAUCE PASSING BY EACH BILL OFF EYES THEIR PASSES TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY A DIFFERENT STRUGGLE
A COUPLE OF TODAY'S BUS I DON'T KNOWN I'M ARRANGING GOODS ON THE SHELVES OF MY SHOP WHEN AN OLD FRIEND COMES IN TO SEE ME HE LOOKS A LITTLE SHOCKED AND ADVISES ME NOT TO TAKE MY USUAL BROUGHT HOME THAT EVENING HE SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO SEE BUT HE DOESN'T SAY WHAT IN THE END CURIOSITY GETS THE BETTER OF ME
IN FRONT OF MY FRIEND'S HOUSE I SEE A MAN WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF HE'S BEEN CRUCIFIED TO ASSIGN ABOVE HIS HEAD READS ESPY YOU QUIT OPERATOR THAT WORKED AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE IT'S HIM I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I'M IN SUCH A STATE THAT I CAN'T GO HOME I DON'T WANT MY MOTHER TO SEE ME LIKE THIS HOW COULD THEY DO THAT LEAVE HE'S BUTCHERED BODY IN FRONT OF HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE IN FRONT OF HIS FAMILY
I'VE DECIDED I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY MORE IT'S GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY THAT GETTING OLD TRADES ON THE HOUSE AS IF ANYONE WHO EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE REVOLUTION EVEN IF IT WAS MANY MONTHS OR YEARS AGO I WAS ONE OF THOSE GUYS OF DISTANT MYSELF FROM ANYONE I USED TO GO TO PROTESTS WITH I DIDN'T WANT THEM SUSPECTING ME OR THEM BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH I'VE DECIDED TO LEAVE
AND YOU CAN CATCH UP WITH ALL FIVE OF THOSE AND DIARY EXTRACTS FROM INSIDE LIKE A WATCHER BUT REALLY ENGROSSING ANIMATED VERSION OF ALL OF THEM NOW ON OUR WEBSITE B.B.C. DOT CO DOT
U.K. STROKE TODAY AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY DAVID KILL CULLEN WHO IS COUNTRY INSURGENCY MILITARY STRATEGIST HE WAS SEEN ADVISOR TO GENERAL DAVID PETRONIUS EXCUSE ME HIS COMMANDING OFFICER IN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND EIGHT AND HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK BLOODIER ISLAMIC STATE AND THE FAILURES OF THE WAR ON TERROR THE FAILURES OF THE WAR ON TERROR THIS LITTLE COLOUR ARE WE LOSING THE WAR ON TERROR IN SYRIA
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN SYRIA IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT FITS WITH THE GENERAL PICTURE OF THE WAR ON TERROR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A FULL ON CONVENTIONAL CONFLICT WITH TANKS AND HEAVY ARTILLERY AND AIRCRAFT DROPPING BARREL BOMBS ON CIVILIANS THREE HUNDRED
A THOUSAND OR SO PEOPLE KILLED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND IT'S WELL PAST THE BOUNDS OF JUST TO TERRORISM PROBLEM AS I AM I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE THE ASSAD REGIME AT THIS POINT IS CURED ROUGHLY NINE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS ISIS SO IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AS A HUMANITARIAN ISSUE I THINK THAT'S A MUCH BETTER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE STOP THE CONFLICT HOW WE PREVENT
THIS HORRENDOUS YOU KNOW SORT OF ACTIONS THAT ARE BEING APPLIED TO CIVILIANS AND THEN WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE PEACE IS THERE NO COMFORT TO BE TAKEN FROM THE FACT THAT THE CEASEFIRE IF THAT'S WHAT WE CAN CALL IT IT IS A PARTIAL CEASEFIRE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BUT IT HAS HELD FOR WEEK PRETTY MUCH
THERE'D BEEN A LOT OF VIOLATIONS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE OVERALL VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINED THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIAN FORCES THAT ARE BACKING THE ASSAD REGIME ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO ENCIRCLE SERIOUS SECOND CITY OF ALEPPO
AND IF THEY SUCCEED IN DOING THAT WE COULD SEE STARVATION AND BLOCKADE ON A MASSIVE SCALE THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL TELL THERE'S ALSO ASAD REGIME OFFENSIVE RIGHT NOW FOCUSING ON RIKER WHERE YOUR CORRESPONDENT WAS WAS REPORTING FROM
AND OF COURSE ISIS AND JOB AND I'M NOT NURSERY A CADRE ALLY I'M NOT PART OF THE CEASEFIRE SO THEY'RE STILL BEING TARGETED BY ALL SIDES AND THAT MEANS THE CIVILIANS IN AREAS THAT THEY CONTROL ARE ALSO AT RISK DO YOU ACCEPT THE ANALYSIS OF A VERY SENIOR NATO GENERAL WHO SAYS AMERICAN GENERAL WHO SAYS THAT RUSSIA IS WEAPONISED ISING
MIGRATION THIS MIGHT MIKE THIS SUITED PEOPLE OATS OUT OF SYRIA TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE CASE I SAW GER NOBODY LOVES COMMENTS AND I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO MAKE HER STATEMENT WITHOUT EVIDENCE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THAT MYSELF BUT I DON'T LOOK AT THAT ISSUE DIRECTLY I'M VERY SURE THAT ISIS HAS TRIED TO WEAPONISED MIGRANTS BY BASICALLY TRYING TO GENERATE A BACKLASH AGAINST MARGARET'S WITHIN EUROPE AS A WAY OF CREATING
THE KIND OF SECTARIAN DYNAMIC THAT THEY HAVE PROVEN VERY GOOD AT EXPLOITING IN PLACES LIKE A RACK AND ELSEWHERE BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT THIS ASSAULT ON RECORD DOES HAPPEN AND THAT THE RUSSIANS AND
THE SYRIAN FORCES DO SUCCEED IN WHAT WE HAVE FAILED TO DO THUS FAR AND THAT IS GET HIM OUT GET ICE'S OUT OF RAKKA WHAT THEN
I THINK THIS IS THE REAL POINT LET'S IMAGINE THAT THROUGH SOME MAGIC PEACE DEAL IS STRUCK TONIGHT
YOU STILL HAVE ELEVEN MILLION DISPLACED PEOPLE HALF THE CITY'S INTERIOR DESTROYED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAD IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE TEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF
VERY SUBSTANTIAL POST CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION AND STABILISATION POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPERS JUST TO GET SYRIA BACK ON ITS FEET AND REMEMBER YOU STILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AYE SIR SEND JOB I'M MISTER WROTE THAT I'M NOT PART OF THE CEASEFIRE SO IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THIS GETS BETTER ANY TIME SOON I'M A FRIEND IS IT NOT CONCEIVABLE THAT THEY CAN BE DESTROYED IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO DESTROY THEM BY WE I MEAN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS COUNTRY RUSSIA SYRIA I THINK THE
THE UPSIDE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY NOW CLOSER TO A PEACE DISCUSSION THEN WE HAVE BEEN AT ANY TIME SINCE ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE AND SO THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL COME TOGETHER AND TRYING TO SUPPORT A PEACE DEAL AND IF WE COULD GET EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER
AGAINST IESUS AND AGAINST UP I'M NOSTRA IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULD SEE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AS WE'VE SEEN IN IRAQ OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS WERE ISIS HAS BEEN ROLLED BACK FROM A NUMBER OF CITIES THAT ARE CONTROLS BUT I'M AFRAID THAT THE PROSPECT OF THAT IS NOT IMMINENT TO MIN WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT KIND OF DEAL STRUCK
IT'S MONTHS AWAY BUT EVEN IF IT IS MONTHS AWAY LET'S ASSUME THE BEST
POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF THAT IS THAT IT IS MONTHS AWAY WOULD WE THEN DO YOU THINK SEE THIS TERRIBLE SCREAM FLOOD
DESPERATE PEOPLE LEAVING SYRIA WOULD WITH THAT BEGIN TO DRY OUT
I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE TO DRY UP IN THE NEW TERM AND THE E.U. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ESTIMATED THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANOTHER TWO MILLION REFUGEES ON TOP OF THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION THAT ARRIVED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN INTO EUROPE BY HER BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY NOT COMING DIRECTLY FROM SYRIA THEY COMING FROM
A REFUGEE CAMPS IN TURKEY AND NORTH AFRICA AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN IN SOME CASES FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND A CHANGE IN THE GRAND INTERIOR IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO START SAVING LIVES BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP THE FLOW OF REFUGEES IN THE SHORT TERM
DAVID THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S HAD ME THAT I'M NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WOMEN IN THE U.K. SPEND MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN MENDING THE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE HAS STUDIED THE WORLD'S APPROACH TO CHILDCARE AND FOUND THAT
ONE OF THE MOST UNEQUAL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WAS NOT IRAQ OR ALBANIA BUT IRELAND WHERE ONLY SEVEN PER CENT OF CHILDCARE WAS UNDERTAKEN BY MEN CLARE EM ELEMENT IS HERE WHO'S OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE'S DIRECTOR OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY HIM US INVOLVED IN THE REPORT WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY
LAUREN HAMPSHIRE WHO IS A MOTHER OF TWO GIRLS IS A FREELANCE JOURNALIST AS WELL AND SEE EMMA HAMPSHIRE WHO IT IS
GOING TO BE QUITE QUIET ISN'T SHE I CAN'T EVEN YOU IF SHE'S DOWN ON THE FLOOR A LITTLE GOAT NOW THERE SHE IS LOOKING SO CUTE SHE'S HOW OLD A MONTH
SHE'S SLEEPING PEACEFULLY THROUGH HER FIRST TODAY PROGRAMME BORED RIGID PROBERT WEIGHT OF JOHN ASK A QUESTION ALL THE WAY UP THANKS BOTH CAN ELEMENT FIRST OR JUST THIS IS A WORLDWIDE SURVEY HOW ON EARTH DID YOU DO IT AND YOU'VE GOT FIGURES FOR IRAQ CAN YOU REALLY DO THAT ACCURATE
WE CAN SURPRISINGLY THE WAY THAT THESE FIGURES ARE COMPILED HIS BY BASICALLY ASKING PEOPLE TO KEEP A DIARY SO YOU ASK PEOPLE TO RECORD DAY BY DAY HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ON DIFFERENT TASKS NOT THAT SCIENTIFIC
THEY DID HAVE THIS KIND OF RESEARCH ARE IN THERE ARE YOU KNOW AS IN ANY KIND OF RESEARCH THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF ASKING THE QUESTION YOU CAN DO A SURVEY WHERE YOU ASK PEOPLE HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU SPEND ON CHILDCARE THIS WEEK OR YOU CAN DO IT IN THIS DAY BY DAY KIND OF WAY AND GENERALLY THEY WRITE I RESULTS TEND TO BE MORE OUT THERE WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE PICTURE IN HIS WHAT HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
THE PICTURE IN THE U.K. IS DEPENDS ON WHAT PERSPECTIVE YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF MUMS IN THE U.K. LIKE LAUREN WHO ARE DOING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE CHILDCARE THINGS CAN SEEM A BIT UNFAIR THE U.K. STILL COMES OUT PRETTY WELL IN THE GLOBAL RANKINGS THOUGH THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING MUCH WORSE BUT YOUR ASSUMPTION IS
IS IT THAT IT SHOULD BE FIFTY FIFTY I WAS SHOULDN'T IS THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE CHOICES AND MEN THAT PEOPLE SHOULD THEY MIGHT HAVE THE CHOICES AND MAKE THESE CHOICES AS THEY HAVE DONE AND STILL END UP WITH THE FIGURES AS THEY ARE OF HIS WHO HAD A MEAN THEY MIGHT DO IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE MOST EQUAL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD SO FINLAND FOR EXAMPLE IS THE COUNTRY THAT COMES OUT HAS CONSISTENTLY TOP OF THESE DIFFERENT RANKINGS ON WHERE IT'S GOOD TO BE A WOMAN
AND IN FINLAND WOMEN ARE STILL DOING A BIT MORE CHILDCARE THAN MEN BUT NOT AS MUCH MORE AS THEY'RE DOING IN SAY THE U.K. OR YOU KNOW IN THE COUNTRIES WHICH ARE MUCH WORSE THAT'S THE BEST KIND OF PROXY THAT WE'VE GOT FOR THE CHOICES THAT WOMEN WOULD MAKE MAYBE A BIT MORE BUT NOT AS MUCH MORE AS THEY'RE DOING IN THE U.K. AND ELSEWHERE GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE LORNA YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT I THINK YES WELL PERSONALLY I THINK UNTIL
CARRY CHILDREN AND PRODUCE MILK THEN OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A SORT OF A BALANCE AND MORE WOMEN ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE OF THE CHILDCARE I'M BREAST FEEDING AND NEAR THE OTHER NIGHT MY HUSBAND I WAS SO TIRED THAT OFF PLEASE CAN YOU TAKE HER AND HE SAID WELL UNTIL I CAN
YOU KNOW GREW BREASTS TO FEED HER IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT FOR CERTAINLY AT THE EARLY STAGES I THINK THIS IS AN ORGANISED SOCIETY AROUND THAT CAN'T YOU SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN EXPRESS MELT THEY CAN ORGANISE THEMSELVES FAMILIES CAN ORGANISE THEMSELVES COUPLES CAN ORGANISE THEMSELVES SO THAT IT'S PRETTY MUCH POSSIBLE TO DO IT YET LEE AT LEAST AFTER A CERTAIN AGE YES SEMI OR YOU CAN ORGANISE YOURSELF ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY IN THE EARLY STAGES I WOULD SAY MOST PARENTING EXPERTS AND MIDWIVES AND THINGS WOULD SAY THAT THE FIRST CERTAINLY THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I WOULD SAY IT'S CERTAINLY FOR A SIX MONTH IT IS
VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE MOTHER THE CHILD HAVE THAT TIME TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE IS THE MOTHER AND THE CHANT RATHER THAN THE FATHER YES BECAUSE THEIR MOTHER IS GENERALLY WELL THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOWADAYS WE KNOW ALL THE BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THOSE THAT THAT BOTTLE FEED AS WELL AYE
COMBINATION FED WITH MY DAUGHTER BUT I DO THINK THAT YES BECAUSE OF BREAST FEEDING BUILDING THAT BOND THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S THIS THE CHILD KNOWS YOUR SMELL AND YOUR SCENT CERTAINLY FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SPEND THAT TIME WITH HER MAYBE WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL COME ELEMENT ABOUT COMPLAINING TOO MUCH ABOUT SOCIETIES WHERE THE DIVISION ISN'T EQUAL IN FAT MAYBE THOSE SOCIETIES THAT ARE MOVING HELTER SKELTER TOWARDS TRYING TO GET TOWARDS FIFTY PERCENT YOU MENTION FINDEN ACTUALLY DOING DAMAGE
I THINK WE NEED TO GET A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE HERE WE'RE VERY LUCKY IN THE U.K. TO HAVE THE CHOICES THAT WE DO BUT WE INTERVIEWED WOMEN IN INDIA FOR EXAMPLE FOR THIS REPORT WHO WERE LEAVING TINY BABIES BEHIND THEM WHEN THEY WENT TO WORK IN TOBACCO FIELDS DANGEROUS PLACES WHERE THEY COULDN'T TAKE THEIR CHILDREN LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM LEAVING THE CHILDREN FOR HOURS EVERY DAY COMING BACK TO FIND THE CHILDREN FALLEN OUT OF BED HAD BEEN CRYING ALL DAY HAD DIRTY BEN NAPPIES AND NOBODY HAD BEEN THIS IS NOT A KIND OF CHOICE IN ANYBODY'S BOOK
YOU HAVE A LOT OF WOMEN HERE WOULD SAY ALL RIGHT NOT THOSE DESPERATE OR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF PRESSURE ON THEM SOMETIMES TO LEAVE CHILDREN IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AREN'T IDEAL AND WITH HUSBANDS WHO WOULD BE BETTER OFF WORKING THEMSELVES ACTUALLY CAUSE THE FAMILY NEEDS THE MONEY
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THIS IS ALL ABOUT CHOICES WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING IN THIS REPORT THAT THERE'S SOME BLUEPRINT ONCE YOU'VE GOT DOWN TO PERFECT EQUALITY THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE O.K. THIS IS ABOUT CHOICES CHOICES THAT WOMEN CAN BE FORCED TO MAKE BY PREVAILING IDEAS ABOUT GENDER AND A WOMAN'S ROLE AND CHOICES THAT WOMEN CAN BE FORCED TO MAKE BY ECONOMICS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO WORK FOR THEIR MONEY
WHAT WE NEED IS FOR PEOPLE TO TO BE SURE THAT WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING IS RIGHT FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILY AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THIS REPORT IS THAT TOO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THE PREVAILING THAT'S INTERESTING POINT ABOUT PREVAILING IDEAS OF MASCULINITY AND
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM YOUR FAMILY PERSPECTIVE LAUREN HAMPSHIRE WE WOULD YOUR HUSBAND HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO TO
LOOK AFTER THE TILL YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER DAUGHTER AS WELL YES IS THAT ACTUALLY ASKED HIM THIS EARLIER AND HE SAID WELL HE HE WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE
HE FIRST OF ALL HE SAID OBVIOUSLY A AND BREAST FEEDING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SLIGHTLY OLDER CHILD HE LOVES MY DAUGHTER SOPHIA WHO IS NEARLY THREE AND THEY PLAY AROUND A LOT BUT BECAUSE SHE HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH ME AND HE'S CONTINUED TO WORK
I TOOK THE TIME OFF AND HAD MATERNITY BENNETT MEET ME ACCENTS FOR ME TOO I MEAN I DID GO BACK TO WORK BUT I WENT BACK PART TIME HE ALSO OWNS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT I THINK GENERALLY THE ISSUE WOULD BE HE WOULD FIND IT QUITE A MASK LEADING TO A TWO
BE AT HOME YOU KNOW HE'S A LAD AND I THINK A LOT OF MEN I AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS REPORT BRINGS UP WHICH I THINK IS GREAT IS THAT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO MAKE
GENDER ROLES IT SEEM MORE NORMAL SLIGHTLY FOR A MAN TO BE AT HOME I'M A WOMAN HERE TALKING ABOUT CHILDCARE ISSUE MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE MORE MEN TALKING ABOUT CHILDCARE ISSUES WE SHOULD MAYBE SEE YOU KNOW I HAVE MORE MEN TALKING ABOUT BEING AT HOME WITH THE CHILDREN AND THAT MIGHT MAKE THAT ISSUE WITH THAT THAT'S A MULTI GENERATIONAL THING ISN'T IT BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT GRAYSON PERRY THE ARTIST HAS GOT A SERIES COMING UP ON CHANNEL FOUR I THINK IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS' TIME WHERE HEAP BASICALLY ATTACKS MASCULINITY AS AN IDEA
BUT HE HIS SUGGESTION RIGHT RIGHT HIS SUGGESTION IS THAT IT'S IS FINISHED IT'S A USELESS IN THE MODERN ERA IT IT DOES A LOT OF DAMAGE AND ACTUALLY NOT THE GOOD IT DOES NO LONGER HAS THE GOOD THINGS THAT BEING A MASCULINE MAN USED TO HAVE I WONDER IF THERE IS A KIND OF FOR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE CARE KIND OF WAY IN WHICH SOCIETY NEEDS TO ADDRESS
THOSE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVING THINGS THAT ARE IN ARE SORE FROM SUCH AN EARLY AGE AND THAT ACTUALLY IS THE ONLY KEY TO GETTING ANY KIND OF A QUALITY QUALITY OF HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE EITHER WAY I ORGANISES
I THINK OBVIOUSLY THE KIND OF QUESTION ABOUT NATURE AND NURTURE AND MASCULINITY IS ONE THAT I'M NOT REALLY QUALIFIED TO ANSWER DO YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE TO GO INTO THAT BUT I THINK WHAT WE SEE FROM THE CHILDCARE AROUND THE WORLD IS THAT MEN ARE TAKING VERY DIFFERENT ROLES THERE ARE SOME MEN IN SCANDINAVIA WHO ARE TAKING MUCH MORE TAKING MUCH MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER THEIR CHILDREN THINKS OF THESE THINGS AREN'T FIXED EVEN IN THIS GENERATION YEAH IT'S ALSO CULTURE ABSOLUTELY I MENTIONED ISLAND RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING AND YOU CAN SEE WHY THINGS ARE AS THEY ARE
IN IRELAND'S A TRADITIONAL SOCIETY WHERE YOU COULD BE SEEN AS THE ATTACKING A CULTURE THAT MANY IRISH PEOPLE ALTHOUGH ONE SUSPECTS MORE MEN THAN WOMEN ARE PERFECTLY HAPPILY ABSOLUTELY WE'RE NOT ATTACKING ANY CULTURE THIS IS ALL ABOUT CHOICES AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE CHOICES
BUT THEY WANT AND THESE ISSUES ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE THOSE CHOICES IS THIS IS THE HARDEST THING TO CHANGE IS YOU SO LAUREN IS IN THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THINGS ABOUT OUR FAMILIES IN THE WAY THAT WE SEE THEMSELVES OURSELVES AND WE SEE EVEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENTS TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING LIE OFFERING SHARED PARENTAL CARE A LOT OF MEN DON'T TAKE IT UP IT'S GOING TO BE A SLOW PROCESS BUT I THINK WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION CLEM ELEMENT AND LAUREN HAMPSHIRE AS WELL AND SEANNA HAS NOT STIR BUT WE'RE JUST A LITTLE PLUG IF YOU GO
THANKS OVER THANK YOU THANK YOU TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW AND HE WAS SLOWLY WITH THE SPORT HELLO AGAIN BRITAIN WON GOLD SILVER AND BRONZE ON DAY TWO OF THE WORLD TRACK CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS IN LONDON DOUBLE OLYMPIC CHAMPION LAURA TROTT BECAME THE TEAM'S FIRST WORLD CHAMPION AT THE EVENT WITH VICTORY IN THE WOMEN SCRATCH RACE THE WIND SOFTEN THE BLOW SHE AND HER TEAM MATE SUFFERED IN THE WOMEN'S PURSUIT EARLIER AFTER FAILING TO QUALIFY FOR THE GOLD MEDAL RACE THE QUARTET CAN STILL CLAIM BRONZE TODAY
SIR BRADLEY WIGGINS AND THE MEN'S PURSUIT TEAM HAD TO SETTLE FOR SILVER AFTER BEING BEATEN BY AUSTRALIA DESPITE THE DEFEAT WIGGIN SAID HE'D PUT HIS HOUSE ON THEN WINNING AT THE OLYMPICS BECKY JAMES PUT THREE YEARS OF INJURY PROBLEMS BEHIND HER WITH A BRONZE IN THE KEIRIN
GREAT BRITAIN BEGIN THEIR DEFENCE OF THE DAVIS CUP IN BIRMINGHAM TODAY ANDY MURRAY KICKS THINGS OFF AGAINST WORLD AND AT NUMBER EIGHTY SEVEN TARO DANIEL THIS AFTERNOON IT'S HIS FIRST COMPETITIVE MATCH SINCE THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN FINAL ALMOST FIVE WEEKS AGO AND SINCE BECOMING A FATHER FORMER BRITISH NUMBER ONE GREG RESENT SKIS BEEN SPEAKING TO US AHEAD OF THE TIME HOW TOUGH WILL IT BE FOR MURRAY TO BE BACK IN ACTION
I THINK IT'S WHETHER YOU GET THE FOCUS AGAIN HE TALKED ABOUT OBVIOUSLY HAVING THE BIRTH OF HIS DAUGHTER SOPHIA WHICH IS A MAGICAL MOMENT FOR ANY COUPLE SO I THINK HE'S WISHING HE WAS AT HOME PARTLY BECAUSE HE'S MISSING OUT ON THOSE FIRST FEW WEEKS BUT ANOTHER PART OF ME IS EXCITED TO BE DEFENDING THE TITLE SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE IN A VERY VERY LONG TIME SO I THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THE FAMILY MARRIED TO THE SIDE AND THEN GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND I THINK IT'LL GONNA BE STRONGER FOR HAVING A FAMILY
BRITAIN WON THE TROPHY IN NOVEMBER AFTER A SEVENTY NINE YEAR WAIT WILL IT BE HARDER TO RETAIN THE DAVIS CUP THAN IT WAS TO WIN IT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ANDY MURRAY HAS A PACKED SCHEDULE AHEAD
I'VE HEARD RUMOURS THAT MARIE SAID HE WANTS TO GO THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN AND TRIED TO DEFEND THE TITLE OF THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S FABULOUS NEWS IF HE DOESN'T PLAY IN THE QUARTER FINAL IF WE GET THERE THEN WE TALK ABOUT ALI ASPETTA NE WHETHER HE GETS APPROVED TO PLAY FOR TEAM G.B. ADDING ANOTHER TOP FIFTY PLAYER
THE MIX WOULD ONLY BENEFIT US SO YOU KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF LITTLE SIDE STORIES TO LOOK INTO AND TO DEFEND IT CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT BUT IF WE WOULD WIN THAT MATCH AND I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF QUITE FINE GET TO THE SEMIS MAYBE MARIE COMES BACK INTO THE TEAM THEN WE HAVE A CHANCE IT'LL BE A BIG ASK FOR TEAM G.B. TO DEFEND IT BUT WHY WOULD THAT BE MAGNIFICENT IMAGINE THAT WE WAITED SEVENTY NINE YEARS IF WE COULD DEFEND IT STRAIGHTAWAY INCREDIBLE

THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS HIT OUT AT THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE E.U. SAYING IT SPIN SMEARS AND THREATS COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES BEYOND THE DATE OF THE REFERENDUM THE A SCEPTIC CONSERVATIVE M.P. LIAM FOX TOLD US THAT THE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES NEEDED TO BE MADE IN A RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTFUL MANNER TO ENSURE IT'S NOT HARDER TO GOVERN AFTERWARDS DOWNING STREET HAS NOT COMMENTED
DONALD TRUMP HAS COME UNDER SUSTAINED ATTACK FROM HIS MAIN RIVALS FOR THE U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE SENATORS MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUISE CRITICISED MY TRUMPS CHANGING POLICIES ON ISSUES SUCH AS IMMIGRATION MISTER TRUMP SAID FLEXIBILITY AS A STRENGTH
BRITISH SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THEY HAD DEVELOPED A WAY TO STEER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO KILL CANCERS BY TARGETING UNIQUE MARKINGS WITHIN TUMOURS THE APPROACH COULD REQUIRE BESPOKE VACCINES AND THERE'S NOT NOT YET BEEN TRIED IN PATIENTS
THE GOVERNMENT IS FACING CAUSED OFFER TEACHERS AND ENGLAND MORE FLEXIBLE WORKING THE RESEARCH GROUP POLICY EXCHANGE SAYS MANY WOMEN WHO LEAVE TEACHING TO BRING UP CHILDREN COULD BE ATTRACTED BACK BY LESS RIGID WORK PATTERNS
THANK YOU THE TIME TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE A SEEKER VACCINE COULD BE READY FOR HUMAN TRIALS IN THE SUMMER THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RESEARCH PROGRAMME DOCTOR ANTHONY FORTUNE SAYS SO HE HOPES TO START TESTING HER D.N.A. VACCINE IN THE U.S. IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER B. SEES GLOBAL HEALTH CORRESPONDENT YOU MAS AMBER HAS BEEN GIVEN RARE ACCESS TO THE AGENCY'S LABORATORIES IN THE STATE AMERICA
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF WASHINGTON D.C. ON AN ENORMOUS HIGH SECURITY MEDICAL CAMPUS IS THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH VACCINE RESEARCH CENTRE
THROUGH A MAZE OF HALLWAYS WE REACH THE LABS WHERE SCIENTISTS DEVELOPED AN ADVANCED EBOLA VACCINE AND ARE NOW WORKING ON ONE THE VACA THESE ARE PLATES GROIN
PLAYERS DOCTOR BARNEY GRAHAM IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE VACCINE RESEARCH CENTRE BACTERIA LIKE LITTLE MANUFACTURING
HE SHOWS ME TINY SPECKS OF ORANGE BACTERIA IN A PETRI DISH HIS TEAM IS CULTIVATING THE BACTERIA WHICH WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THE ACTIVE AGENT IN THE VACCINE WE DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT SEEKER VACCINES GENERALLY WEREN'T MADE QUICKLY TYPICALLY RAG SCENES TAKE DECADES TO GROW UP I WANT YOU DISCOVERED A VIRUS
MOST VACCINES FOR DEPLOYMENT TO THE PUBLIC WOULD TAKE AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS ON AIR
BUT NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES ARE CHANGING ALL THAT SCIENTISTS HERE WERE ALREADY DEVELOPING A VACCINE FOR A SIMILAR VIRUS WHICH GIVES THEM A BIT OF A HEAD START IN THIS GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY THIS IS AN EVOLVING SITUATION WHERE WE'RE EARNING WITH ROY ON A WEEK BY WEEK MONTH BY MONTH BASIS DOCTOR ANTHONY FOUND SHE IS THE MAN CHARGED WITH ENSURING THE U.S. GET PHYSIQUE A VACCINE FAST THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN AROUND ONE HUNDRED IMPORTED CASES IN AMERICA
HE HEADS UP THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGIES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES YOU WILL HAVE A VACCINE THAT'S READY TO GO INTO HUMANS TO TEST NOT TO DISTRIBUTE BUT TEST FOR SAFETY AND FOR WHERE THEY WERE IT INDUCES A RESPONSE THAT YOU WOULD PRE DECK WOULD BE PROTECTED
THAT PHASE ONE TRIAL I BELIEVE WILL LIKE WE START TOWARDS THE END OF THIS SUMMER OR EARLY FOR
WHEN I SEE PICTURES OF MAKKAH CEPHALIC BABY IT IT GIVES ME THE FORCE IN THE ENERGY TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE
ALL HANDS ON DECK EVERYBODY DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHO ARE YOU AIMING THIS VACCINE OUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE MOST AT RISK RIGHT THE TARGET WILL BE BROADLY EVERYONE BUT THE SPECIFIC TARGET WILL BE WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE
YOU'D LIKE TO VACCINATE A WOMAN BEFORE SHE BECOMES PREGNANT GETTING TO THAT STAGE OF HER ZEKE A VACCINE BEING WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO IT IS STILL SOME WAY OFF THE EARLIEST THAT COULD HAPPEN IS LIKELY TO BE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR BEYOND
THAT WAS TRUE IT WAS A REPORTING FROM MARILYN LET'S TALK TO PROFESSOR TRULY LANG HE'S PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH THE SCENT OF A TROPICAL MEDICINE AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING ALISTAIR AS BEST YOU CAN SAY IS THAT THINGS ARE PROGRESSING AS AS FAST AS THEY CAN
YEAH IT IS WITHOUT QUESTION AMAZING PROGRESS BECAUSE WE WERE AT A STANDING START WITH THAT WITH SIKA UNLIKE ABOUT AS THEY MENTIONED IN THE REPORT BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HERE THIS VACCINE IS BEING TARGETED AND HARRY TEST IN THE FIELD NOT JUST IN PHASE ONE TRIALS IN THE U.S. YEAH AND HOW DO YOU THINK THE TESTING SHOULD BE DONE
YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO START DOING IT THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW SAY AS THEY SAID IN THE REPORT IT USUALLY TAKES ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS TO DEVELOP A VACCINE AND THINGS HAPPEN IN A SORT OF SLOW STEP WISE APPROACH USUALLY AND SO WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE SUMMER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO PHASE ONE TRIALS ON HEALTHY PEOPLE IN AMERICA
AND WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT NOW IS HOW WE DO FIELD TRIALS IN PEOPLE THAT WE ARE EXPECTING TO BE EXPOSED TO SEEK A VIRUS SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT RUNNING TRIALS IN IN DIFFICULT SETTINGS IN THEIR RESOURCE COUNTRIES WHERE THE MEN OF THE DISEASE AND THE OBVIOUS REAL DIFFICULTY ABOUT TESTING IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING EFFECT ON PREGNANT WOMEN BUT YOU CAN'T TESTED ON BETTER MOMENT
NO AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S SEEMS TO BE AGREED AT THIS POINT THAT THE AIM WOULD BE TO TAKE TO DEVELOP A VACCINE A BIT LIKE WE DO HERE WE STAND WITH MONTHS THAT WE HAVE A VACCINE THAT'S PRE PREGNANCY BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO DO STUDIES AND PREGNANCY IT'S IT'S JUST SUCH A MASSIVE ETHICAL CHALLENGE AND VERY DIFFICULT AND ALSO WE STILL DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE STILL DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE LINKS ARE BETWEEN SECRET MY CAREFULLY AND WE DON'T KNOW AT WHAT STAGE
DIFFICULTIES ARE HAPPENING AND SO TARGETING WHERE A VACCINE WOULD ACT IS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SO THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE STILL LOOKING AT A PRE PREGNANCY VACCINE AT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION DECLARED A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THEY'VE DONE THAT RELATIVELY QUICKLY THEY WERE CRITICISED LOT ABOUT EBOLA WEREN'T THEY AND ARE THEY DOING ENOUGH NOW TO LEAD ON
YEAH I MEAN THEY WERE IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION AND I'M SURE EVERYBODY IS AGREED THEY DID THE RIGHT THING IN THEY DECLARED THE EMERGENCY AROUND THE INCREASE IN MAKKAH CAREFULLY WHICH IS A VERY WISE MOVE AND THAT THE SITUATION IS AN EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO LEARN A LOT MORE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED STRONG NEUTRAL INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP SAID THAT THIS ISN'T LED BY ONE ONE BY ONE NATION AND EDIT IT TRULY DOES REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE GLOBAL SITUATION FIZZY CARE BUT WHAT DOES I NEED SHOULD LOOK LIKE I MEAN WHAT DO THEY NEED TO DO THAN NOT GOING AT THE MOMENT
YEAH WELL IT'S GETTING THERE BUT WE EMMA AND THE IRONY IS WITH THIS IS WE WERE ALL US IN THE BONE A MEETING WHEN WE FIRST LEARNT ABOUT SACRE AND
THE SITUATION IS THAT WE WERE JUST BEGINNING TO LEARN FROM THE BOWLER AND THE W.H.O. IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB PUTTING DOWN ITS BLUEPRINT FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND FOR DISEASE OUTBREAKS BUT WE WERE AT THE STAGE OF HAVING MEETINGS ABOUT THAT AND DECIDING HOW TO DO IT SAY THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO ACTION RIGHT NOW REALLY AND ANY WEE W.H.O. D'YOU NEED TO STEPH'S HAPPILY THE PROCESS SO WE FORGET THESE STUDIES PLANNED IN THE FIELD AND HAVE AND HAVE THEIR STRONG EFFORT I SEE SO IT'S SO IT'S WHAT IT'S HAVING THEIR PEOPLE ALERTED IN PLACES WHERE THEY MIGHT BE LIKELY TO HAVE TO SPRING INTO ACTION IS THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
YEAH IT'S WHAT WE NEED TO HAPPEN IS WE NEED THE VACCINES DESIGNED WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW THEY NEED TESTING IN PHASE ONE THERE MANY TESTING IN THE FIELD THEY ALSO NEED TO BE MANUFACTURED AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PRICED INAPPROPRIATE TO USE GLOBALLY AND SO THAT ALL OF THAT NEEDS COORDINATION HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE RATHER THAN ON C. ONE AT A TIME
AND EVERYBODY'S INTEREST NEEDS TO BE TO BE LOOKED AFTER HE SO THE VACCINE CAN BE USED IN PLACES IT'S MADE IT AND SO THAT NEEDS THE INTERNATIONAL NEUTRAL LEADERSHIP
PROFESSOR TRULY LANG FROM THE CENTRAL TROPICAL MEDICINE AND OBVIOUSLY THANKS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE FOR TWENTY SEVEN HOURS THE GREAT FILM DIRECTOR FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT TALK TO ANOTHER GREAT FILM DIRECTOR ALFRED HITCHCOCK POSSIBLY THE LONGEST FILM INTERVIEW ON RECORD THAT WAS BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT'S ACQUIRED A LEGENDARY STATUS IN THE FILM WORLD NOW ANOTHER FILM DIRECTOR KEN JONES HAS USED IT TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY OF HIS OWN NICOLA STAMP WHICH SPOKE TO HIM
IN THE FILM HITCHCOCK TRUTH THOUGH BY KENT JONES THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT DIRECTORS TURNS TO THE FILM VERTIGO WHAT
POETRY ONE OF YOUR MOST POETIC FILMS MORE POETIC THAN DRAMATIC SAYS TREE A FEW MAD COULD QUICKLY OVER IT HAS A DREAMLIKE QUALITY IT WAS CALLED OR BETTY CAN OR BUBBLES OR COFFEE WHILE YOUR OTHER FILMS HALT ON RAPID MOVEMENT I COULD BE HERE PRESSURE DEALING WITH THE POINT
LET'S SET THE SCENE NINETEEN SIXTY TWO TWENTY SEVEN HOURS OF INTERVIEW
BETWEEN THE THIRTY YEAR OLD FRANCOIS TRUTH AND ALFRED HITCHCOCK SIXTY THREE YEARS OLD HOW DID IT COME ABOUT FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT FRENCH FILM MAKERS OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE FRENCH FRENCHMAN
HE HAD JUST MADE HIS THIRD
HE HAD BECOME AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED FILM MAKER WHEN YOU WENT TO NEW YORK
TO DO PROMOTION FOR JAWS AND PEOPLE ASKED HIM WHO THE FILM MAKERS THAT INFLUENCED YOU IN THAT HAD THE MOST PROFOUND EFFECT ON YOUR OWN WHEN HE SET OFF AT HITCHCOCK HE WOULD GET A LAUGH HE SAID I'M SICK OF THIS I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO HE CONTACTED HITCHCOCK
AND SAID I WOULD LIKE TO DO A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH YOU AND FROM THAT BUILD THE BOOK THAT WOULD BE OF LOOK AT YOU IN TERROR CAREER OFFER PROOF THAT YOU ARE REALLY THE GREATEST FILM MAKER IN THE WORLD TRUE FO DESCRIBES IT LIKE A COOK BOOK FULL OF RECIPES FOR MAKING FILMS YES WHAT IS A SURPRISING INSIGHTS THAT COME OUT FROM THESE CONVERSATIONS FOR YEARS WITH HITCHCOCK TALKING ABOUT HIS CRAFT I THINK IT'S ENDLESSLY SURPRISING
A SERIOUS APPROACH TO WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT IT IS TO MAKE A FILM IS PROMPTING HIM TO SPEAK ABOUT HIS CRASH
IN DETAIL IN A WAY THAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAS BEFORE AND HE'S A MAGICIAN ISN'T HE AS WELL HE TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIGHTING MILK THAT'S A VERY FAMOUS MOMENT AND SUSPICION
CARY GRANT IS MARRIED TO JOAN FONTAINE AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER
THERE'S A MOMENT WHEN SHE IS LYING AND HE SAYS I'LL GET YOU SOME MILK TO CALM YOU DOWN AND HELP YOU SLEEP SHE'S PREPARED FOR IT TO BE POISONED SO HITCHCOCK HACKSAW WE PUT THE LIGHT INSIDE THE KNOCK IN MUST HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY
DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING IS VERY PROUD OF HIMSELF WHEN HE DESCRIBES THESE THINGS DID WE KNOW THAT ALREADY OR IS TRUTH OH GETTING MORE INSIGHT FROM THESE CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THAT INSTANCES IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE KNEW WHEN THE BOOK CAME OUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS
WERE REALLY DESCRIBED THROUGH THE FIRST'S TIME FOR INSTANCE THAN THE SHARD OF THE FAMOUS CHARLES INVERTER DOLL OF THE MOVIE AND ZOOM OUT THAT CREATES THE VERDICT
JIMMY STEWART IS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS THAT'S A VERY CAREFUL USE OF A MARVEL IS CLEAR I DID A SILK LOSE SHE'S GOT CALLED DONOR DOLL
OF THE AIR FOR US TO BE A WOMAN SEE METAL USED IN THE IMAGE OF A DEAD WOMAN LOOK YOU FUN ABOUT PHILBY MOST PROBABLE THIS BOOK INFLUENCES THE GREAT AND GOOD INCLUDING MARTIN SCORSESE SPEAKS IN YOUR FILM SO IT WAS REALLY REVOLUTIONARY
BASED ON THAT THE TRUE OR BOB BUT THE BECAME RADICAL
AGUS
ALMOST AS IF SOMEBODY HAD TAKEN A WEIGHT OFF OUR SHOULDERS AND SAID YES WE CAN EMBRACE THIS WE COULD GO MEANING NO MORE WORRIES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CINEMA WAS AN ART FORM WHAT YOU HAD WAS PEOPLE WHO THROUGH THAT BOOK FOUND A DOOR AWAY TO
WHAT MOVIE MAKING REALLY WAS AND IT MOVES LIKE ONE A TRUFFAUT'S ON FILMS IN THE SECOND EDITION OF IT BY THE WAY THE UPDATED EDITION OF IT WAS THE LAST THING HE EVER FINISH
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD A VERY EARLY AGE HE WAS FIFTY TWO FOUR YEARS AFTER HITCHCOCK CUT IT
NO NICHOLAS DAMAGE ARE REPORTING THAT THE TIME FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE MENTION SNOW A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE PROGRAMME
THIS MORNING AND IF YOU'RE LIVING IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY QUITE HEAVY OVERNIGHT SNOW SHOWERS PARTICULARLY ON HIGHER GROUND BUT NOT CONFINED TO HIGH GROUND LEEDS BRADFORD AIRPORT SUSPENDING ALL FLIGHTS THIS MORNING DAN JOHNSON THE B.B.C.'S DAN JOHNSON IS WELL TELL US WHERE YOU ARE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
I AM JUST BY THE M. SIXTY TWO JUST IN AT HIGH UP IN THE PENNINES THIS IS A TOP ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS ON THE MOTORWAY NETWORK IN ENGLAND AND IT'S BEEN SNOWING HERE SINCE LATE LAST NIGHT SO THERE IS ABOUT PROBABLY FIVE TO TEN CENTIMETRES ON THE GROUND IT'S CAUSING DISRUPTION ON MANY OF THE ROADS AROUND HERE ALTHOUGH THE M. SIXTY TWO ITSELF IS FLOWING PRETTY FREELY THIS MORNING SOME OF THE OTHER TRANS PENNINE ROUTES ARE IN MORE DIFFICULTY THE SNAKE PASS BETWEEN SHEFFIELD AND MANCHESTER
HAS BEEN BLOCKED FOR A TIME AND AS YOU SAY LEEDS BRADFORD AIRPORT NOT FAR FROM HERE CLOSED BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH SNOW ON THE RUNWAY THEY'RE TRYING TO CLEAR THAT AT THE MOMENT THERE'S BEEN DISRUPTION TO TO MANY OF THE SCROLLS HERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HILLS IN YORKSHIRE AND IN LANCASHIRE AS WELL AROUND OLDHAM A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS CLOSED
SO DIFFICULT TIME FOR PARENTS AND SCHOOL KIDS THIS MORNING THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MISHAPS OUT ON THE ROAD JUST ON ONE OF THE LITTLE LANES HERE THAT RUNS DOWN AWAY FROM THE MOTORWAY THERE WAS A CAR OVERTURNED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING THE DRIVER OF THAT VEHICLE HAS HAD TO BE TREATED IN THE CAR IS STILL ON ITS ROOF
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SO THAT LANE IS BLOCKED IT SHOWS YOU THAT THE SIDE ROADS A MORE DIFFICULT ONE OF THE BACK LANES HERE ALONGSIDE THE MOTORWAY IS AT A COMPLETE STANDSTILL TRAFFIC CRAWLING SOME DRIVER STRUGGLING TO GET UP THE HILL BECAUSE OF THE SNOW AND ICE THAT IS ON THE ROAD SO DIFFICULT CONDITIONS OUT FOR PEOPLE THIS MORNING ON THE SNOW KEEPS ON COMING SO CONDITIONS ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND COULD BE DIFFICULT RIGHT THROUGH TODAY
DAN THANKS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA KIM JONG UN HAS ORDERED HIS COUNTRY TO BE READY TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AT ANY TIME THE STATE CONTROLLED MEDIA REPORTED OVERNIGHT AT THE MILITARY SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAGE A PRE EMPTY OF A TACKLE I'M JOINED BY JOHN EVERARD WHO WAS BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO NORTH KOREA FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH TAKE THE STUFF SERIOUSLY
WELL YES WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT THEN FRANKLY THERE'S NOTHING MUCH NEW IN THIS VARIOUS NORTH KOREAN STATEMENTS OVER TIME HAVE SHOWN THEIR NUCLEAR DOCTRINE IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT IS TO LAUNCH PREVENTIVE STRIKES MORE OVER THE NORTH KOREANS DON'T SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WOULD SURVIVE IT COUNTER STRIKE BY THEIR ENEMIES SO THAT THE MILITARY LOGIC WOULD BE THAT YOU WOULD NOT ONLY USE UNIQUE WEAPONS IN A FIRST STRIKE
BUT HE'D USE THEM ALL AT ONCE TO AVOID HOW TO USE THEM OR LOSE THEM USABLE ISN'T EXACTLY SO I'VE GOT I THOUGHT THEY'D DUG LOTS AND LOTS OF HUGE TUNNELS IN NORTH KOREA YES THEY HAVE PROBABLY VERY DEEP NEVERTHELESS THEY DON'T SEEM TO THINK THAT THESE TILES WERE PROTECT THE NICU APPETITE GOING HAVE THEY ANYTHING AT THE MOMENT THAT COULD SERIOUSLY THREATEN ANYBODY OTHER THAN THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS INDEED HAVE THEY GOT ANYTHING THREATEN THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS WELL THEY CERTAINLY
I HAVE GOTTEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE DELIVERY VEHICLES YET TO DELIVER A NUCLEAR WEAPON TO THE UNITED STATES TO COULD THEY THREATEN THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURS YES THAT THEY PROBABLY COULD
EUGH IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PUT A NUCLEAR WEAPON ON THE HEAD OF A SHORT RANGE MISSILE WOULD RATHER LARGER PAYLOADS A SHELL OF SOME SORT DO YOU MEAN A SHELL YES OR NEED A SORT RANGE ROCKET HAD TO USE A BALLISTIC MISSILE FOR A LONG RIDGE DELIVERY ALSO THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF UNCONVENTIONAL DELIVERY MEANS SIMPLY PUTTING YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPON ON THE BACK OF A TRUCK AND DRIVING TO YOUR DESTINATION
REALLY YES I MEAN THAT THAT IS TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE YOU JUST HAVE TO GET THE TRUCK ACROSS THE BORDER SOMEHOW WHICH IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT BUT THAT THEIR IT'S THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE WORLD THAT COULD HAVE IT WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS FOR EVER COULDN'T GET NOWHERE AT ALL BUT DO YOU THINK BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE A THREAT TO US DO THEY DO THEY THREATEN THE WORLD
YES I MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT PRE EMPTY OF USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO ASSUME THAT THEY'RE NOT SERIOUS THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO SEE THE LIFE YOU OF YOU NUCLEAR WEAPON IT WOULD OF COURSE BE THE FIRST TIME THIS HAD HAPPENED IN THE SECOND WAR EXACTLY AND WHAT SORT OF THING COULD CAUSE THEM TO DO IT
THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD LAUNCH A PRINT TO STRIKE IN THE FACE OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION NOW HOW
SLIGHT OR PROVOCATION WILL HAVE TO BE AND WHAT FORM IT MIGHT TAKE AND WHAT FOR MY TAKE THEY ARE VERY QUIET APART OF COURSE THEY WANT TO CREATE DOUBT THEY WANT PEOPLE TO WONDER AND TO BE UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW FAR THEY CAN GO BEFORE NORTH KOREA UTE ISN'T SHE WEAPONS AND IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ANSWERABLE TRIED ANYWAY ARE THEY MAD ENOUGH TO RISK
THEIR OWN LIVES THE LIVES OF THEIR LOT OF OF OF
THE DESTRUCTION OF NORTH KOREA THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT MAD THEY CALCULATE VERY CAREFULLY
YES OF COURSE THEY MUST KNOW THAT IF THEY EVER DID USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS THIS WOULD INVITE DEVASTATING RETALIATION WOULD THEY REALLY WEEP OVER THE DESTRUCTION NORTH KOREA THEY WERE PROBABLY WEEP BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT BY THE TIME THAT HAPPENED PROBABLY MOST OF THE NORTH CRIM ELITE HAD GOT IN THEIR PRIVATE JETS AND WE'RE OUT OF THE COUNTRY ANYWAY JOHN EVER OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

MARTIN PATIENCE REPORTING FROM NIGERIA FOUR MINUTES TO NINE OUR JUDGE HAS SAID MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO HELP WOMEN WHO REPORT ATTACKS BY MEN THEY HAVE MET THROUGH DATING WEBSITES HE JUST SENT TO JAIL A MAN CONVICTED OF RAPING FIVE WOMEN ATTACKING TWO OTHERS THAT HE'D MET ON THE MATCH DOT COM CYCLE I'M JOINED BY GEORGE KID WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ONLINE DATING AGENCY WHAT WHAT ARE THE RULES MISTER KID AT THE MOMENT
WHAT'S THE REGULATIONS I THINK THERE'S A COMPANY THAT
LET'S START WITH THE LAW THE LAW OF THE LAND SAYS THAT BETTER RAPES AND HE GO IT'S A CRIME BUT THE SAME DATA PROTECTION SAME WITH THE TRADING RULES WHEN IT COMES TO CODES OF PRACTICE IN THE INDUSTRY I THINK THERE WRITTEN THERE'S A SEPARATION A SET OF RULES WHICH WE WOULD EXPECT INDUSTRY MEMBERS TO DO IN TERMS OF THEIR BEHAVIOURS THE PRICE THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS BUT IN TERMS OF VETTING POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF VETTING WE EXPECT EVERY PROFILE TO BE CHECKED BEFORE SOMEBODY COMES ON SITE THAT'S O.K. DO THAT NOT EASY COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND
NO I MEAN THESE PEOPLE ARE EXPERTS IN THE INDUSTRY SOMEBODY SAYS I'M A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD ARMY COLONEL I'VE GOT A JAGUAR YOU CAN'T GO AND CHECK
YOU CAN CHECK THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE YOU COULD IT IS LOOK AT THE PHOTO YOU COULD LOOK AT THE DEVICE THAT HE'S REGISTERED HIS HIS HIS INTEREST FROM THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THE SCENES AND THERE'S NO HOW ABOUT WHAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FAKE PROFILE AND WHAT PROPORTION GET TURFED OUT
DIFFICULT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER BUT IT DAILY WE ARE USING THE SOFTWARE TO MAKE SURE WHEN IT COMES TO NUMBERS IT'S NOT ABOUT RAPE IS THIS AN AWFUL CASE BUT IT'S MORE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S FREE OF SCAMMERS AND MISCHIEF AND FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE MAYBE EVEN MAKE MONEY OUT OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ALL THAT SORT OF THING RIGHT SO HOW CAN YOU HELP THEM
YOU CAN HELP THEM IN THAT SENSE IF SOMEBODY HAS IF A WOMAN HAS BEEN ATTACKED THEN WHAT CAN YOU DO
IT'S ALMOST BEEN ATTACKED AT THERE ARE TWO PROBABLE
OUTCOMES WHAT ONE IS SHE'LL HAVE GONE TO THE POLICE AND TOLD US WHAT WAS THAT THE SITE INVOLVED ORCHARD GOD'S BITS NOT TILL THE SITE INVOLVED THE OTHER POSSIBILITY AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE MATCH CASE WITH THE THE LAWRENCE CASE WAS WOMAN HAD NOT GONE TO THE POLICE AND HAD COME BACK TO THE
TO THE SITE PROVIDER AND SAID I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE BUT I'D NOT SAID THIS KIND OF BAD EXPERIENCE DIDN'T SAY SHE'D BEEN RAPED AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOT SO THE CHALLENGE THEN WHICH WE'RE WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS IS HOW DO YOU LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND REALLY HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT EXPERIENCE MAY BE A LOUSY DATE AND HE DIDN'T BUY YOU A DESSERT OR ABOUT EXPERIENCES SOME SO YOU SUMMARILY WHO IS TRY EXACTLY
SO WHICH MATCH DID THIS AND WE'RE DOING IT ACROSS THE WHOLE INDUSTRY BRINGING IN EXPERTS IN THIS CASE THE SUZY LAMP LIT TRUST WHO WORKED ON STALKING AND CARE I SAID YOU CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE WHAT NONE NO THE POINT WITH THAT WAS TRAINING SO THAT WE ARE EMPATHETIC WERE HEARING AND GETTING THE RIGHT MESSAGES IF SOMEBODY COMES TO US WITH A MESSAGE AND WE HAVE GOT TO THE ROOT OF IT WE WERE ABSOLUTELY SICK PEOPLE GO TO THE POLICE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE GOING TO THE POLICE AND IT'S STILL A VERY
DIFFICULT ISSUE TO GO TO THE POLICE ABOUT IF YOU'VE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THERE'S OTHER SIGNPOSTING WHETHER IT'S RICK CRISIS OR DO YOU COME ON TO THE WEBSITE CAN'T REPORT AT THAT PERSON OF THE BASIS OF THE WOMAN'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS GOES TO THE JUDGES COMMENTS IN THIS CASE WAS IT'S HARD TO JOIN THE DOTS BECAUSE OUR WEBSITE IF YOU GO ALONG TO THE POLICE AND SAY WOULD LIKE TO REPORT AN OFFENCE THE POLICE WILL SAY WILL LOOK BRING ALONG THE OFFENDER IT BRING ON THE VICTIM OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST A THIRD PARTY WITH A VIEW SHOULD THAT BE CHANGED
IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT HIM AND I'M NOT A LEGAL EXPERT THERE'S GOT TO BE THERE ARE REASONS WHY THEY DO THAT BUT I THINK WE NEED CHANGE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JOINING THE DOT IS BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS TO GO ONTO A WEBSITE NO I DON'T THINK SO I THINK HE'S BECOMING SAFER ALL THE TIME I THINK THE MIXTURE OF TECHNOLOGY THE PROFILE CHECKING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SAID WE'RE GONNA DO COME OUT OF THIS IS WHATEVER WE CAN DO BY WAY OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITH THE POLICE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT WITHIN THE INDUSTRY SO THAT IF SOMEBODY PROVES TO BE A BAD APPLE WILL BE SHARING
