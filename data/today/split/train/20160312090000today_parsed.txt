IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON A SATURDAY THE TWELFTH OF MARCH GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING ENERGY FIRM E.D.F. SAYS IT WON'T PRESS AHEAD WITH THE NEW HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR PLANT IN SOMERSET WITHOUT MORE MONEY FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
A RALLY ORGANISED BY THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CANCELLED FOLLOWING VIOLENCE BETWEEN SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS MORE THAN HALF A MILLION DISABLED PEOPLE COULD LOSE OUT AS A RESULT OF FURTHER CHANGES TO WELFARE PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS PLUS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME MICHAEL MOORE POGO ON WHY HE THOUGHT THE STAGE VERSION OF WAR HORSE WAS BOUND TO FAIL I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO IT WITH PUPPETS I THOUGHT YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING PUPPETS THERE FIRST OF ALL HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK SO I DID NOT HAVE FAITH AND
WE WILL BE REMEMBERING KEITH EMERSON EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER WHO HAS DIED APPARENTLY KILLED HIMSELF AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY ONE TODAY'S NEWSREADER AND A SPEECH
THE ENERGY COMPANY E.D.F. IS SEEKING MORE MONEY FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BEFORE HE GOES AHEAD WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW NUCLEAR REACTOR AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET UNCERTAINTY HAS SURROUNDED THE HUGELY COSTLY PROJECT EARLIER THIS WEEK E.D.F.'S FINANCE DIRECTOR RESIGNED WARNING THE CONTRACT WOULD BREAK THE COMPANY NOW THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE JEAN BENARR LEVY HAS SET OUT HIS VIEWS IN A LETTER TO HIS STAFF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT SAYS IT REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE HINCKLEY SCHEME HERE'S OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
THE LETTER FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO REASSURE FRENCH STAFF AT THE STATE CONTROLLED ENERGY GIANT BUT IT WOULDN'T PROCEED WITH HINKLEY POINT IF IT WAS THOUGHT IT PUT THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY IN DOUBT A DECISION ON THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION POUND PROJECT IS IMMINENT AND INTERNAL DEBATE AS TO THE WISDOM OF PRESSING AHEAD SO THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER RESIGNED JUST A FEW DAYS AGO
MOODY'S THE CREDIT RATING AGENCY HAS ALSO THREATENED TO DOWNGRADE THE COMPANY IF IT GIVES HINCKLEY THE GREEN LIGHT THE FRENCH UNIONS WHO HOLD SEATS ON THE COMPANY'S BOARD ARE HOLDING AN INTERNAL REFERENDUM IN WHICH THEY ARE ADVISING STAFF TO VOTE AGAINST THE PROJECT HOWEVER THE COMPANY HAS TOLD THE B.B.C. THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ON MAKING SUFFICIENT FUNDS AVAILABLE ON GOING AND IT REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT THE PROJECT WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PROVIDE SEVEN PER CENT OF ALL U.K. ELECTRICITY WE'LL GO AHEAD
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS PLANS TO CHANGE SOME OF THE WELFARE BENEFITS RECEIVED BY DISABLED PEOPLE WILL SAVE MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WON'T RECEIVE THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT INTRODUCED BY THE COALITION THREE YEARS AGO SEVERAL CHARITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS WAS INTRODUCED BY THE COALITION GOVERNMENT'S THREE YEARS AGO RECIPIENTS RECEIVE BETWEEN AROUND TWENTY TWO POUNDS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS A WEEK THE AMOUNT HE'S DETERMINED AFTER AN ASSESSMENT BY THE IMPACT A DISABILITY HAS ON DAILY LIVING OR MOBILITY
THE MINISTERS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO HAVE WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS LOW OR MINIMAL ONGOING EXTRA COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR CONDITION ARE STILL BENEFICIARIES OF REGULAR PAYMENTS SO THE FORMULA FOR ARRIVING AT HOW MUCH RECIPIENTS WILL RECEIVE HIS TO CHANGE FROM JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY
SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD BE AFFECTED PAYMENTS TOTALLING ONE POINT TWO BILLION POUNDS WON'T BE PAID THE CHARITY DISABILITY RIGHTS YOU KAY TOLD THE B.B.C. THAT WHAT'S IT CALLED THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF CUTS TO BOTH BENEFITS AND SOCIAL CARE WAS ERODING THE CAPACITY FOR SOME DISABLED PEOPLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY
BRITAIN IS TO ENHANCE ITS MILITARY TRAINING MISSION IN IRAQ AT LEAST THIRTY MORE TROOPS WILL BE SENT TO THE COUNTRY TAKING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF U.K. MILITARY PERSONNEL THERE TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THEY WILL CONCENTRATE ON SPECIFIC TASKS AS A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BEALE EXPLAINS
SO FAR A FEW HUNDRED BRITISH MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN TRADING THE PECHE MURDER IN THE NORTH AND THE IRAQI ARMY AT BASES NEAR BAGHDAD IN BASIC INFANTRY SKILLS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT FROM MINES AND ROADSIDE BOMBS AS WELL AS RUDIMENTARY BATTLEFIELD MEDICINE
BUT THE U.K. NOW WANTS TO SEND THIRTY MORE MILITARY TRAINERS TO FOCUS ON LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND RECONSTRUCTION THE NUMBERS ARE STILL SMALL BUT IT'S A SIGN THAT ATTENTION IS NOW TURNING TOWARDS THE LONG AWAITED BATTLE FOR MOSEL
THE U.S. LED COALITION THOUGH IS ALSO UNDER PRESSURE TO ADDRESS THE AFTERMATH OF WAR HOW TO HELP ME BUILD AND REPOPULATE TOWNS AND CITIES LYCRA MARDY RECENTLY LIBERATED FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE U.K. TEAM WILL INCLUDE SPECIALISTS IN BRIDGE BUILDING MANY BRIDGES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED EITHER BY THE EXTREMISTS OR FROM COALITION AIR STRIKES
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN FORCED TO CANCEL A RALLY IN CHICAGO BECAUSE OF ANGRY PROTESTS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAD GATHERED OUTSIDE THE VENUE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS HOURS BEFORE HE WAS DUE TO ARRIVE EARLIER POLICE ARRESTED MORE THAN THIRTY PEOPLE AS A TRUMP RALLY IN MISSOURI
THE AYE AYE SAYS HE BELIEVES THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS PLANNING ANOTHER INCREASE IN INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX IN THE BUDGET NEXT MONTH IT HAS APPEAL TO THE TREASURY NOT TO TREAT DRIVERS AS WELL IT'S ON WHEELS THE TURKS AFFECTS THE COST OF FIFTY MILLION INSURANCE POLICIES FOR CARS HOMES HEALTH CARE AND PETS IS A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GONE PUT
THE AYE AYE WHICH IS ITSELF A LEADING INSURANCE PROVIDER SAYS IT'S HEARD FROM SENIOR WESTMINSTER SOURCES THAT GEORGE OSBORNE COULD ADD THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS TO INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX TAKING IT TO TWELVE AND A HALF PER CENT AND RAISING ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR
ARISE WOULD ADD THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS TO THE AVERAGE CAR INSURANCE PREMIUM MUCH MORE FOR YOUNG DRIVERS AND WOULD ALSO APPLY TO BREAKDOWN COVER THE TREASURY SAID IT DIDN'T COMMENT ON BUDGET SPECULATION BUT AFTER A WEIGHTY INCREASE AN INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX LAST YEAR INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE VIEWED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS AN EASY TARGET
LEADERS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OR CALLING FOR EXTRA FUNDING TO BE ALLOCATED TO SOCIAL CARE IN THE BUDGET IN A LETTER TO THE CHANCELLOR THEY SAY CUTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE PUT REAL PRESSURE ON THE N.H.S. WITH HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND AND ABLE TO DISCHARGE THOSE PATIENTS WERE READY TO LEAVE OR ADMIT NEW ONES BECAUSE BIRDS REMAIN FULL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS COUNCILS HAVE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR SOCIAL CARE RUNNING INTO BILLIONS OF POUNDS AND THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
THE HOME OFFICE IS PLANNING TO SET UP A NEW FORENSIC AND BIOMETRIC SERVICE FOR YEARS AFTER IT MADE THE CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO ABOLISH ITS PREDECESSOR THE PROPOSAL IS PART OF WHAT MINISTERS SAY IS A NEW NATIONAL APPROACH TO FORENSIC SCIENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES I HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT REPORTS
IN TWENTY TWELVE THE HOME OFFICE CLOSE THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE A GOVERNMENT OWN COMPANY SAYING IT WAS LOSING TWO MILLION POUNDS EACH MONTH BUT LAST YEAR THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WARNED THAT STANDARDS OF FORENSIC SCIENCE WORK WERE IN DANGER OF SLIPPING BECAUSE POLICE WERE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON UNREGULATED EXPERTS TO EXAMINE SAMPLES FROM SUSPECTS AND CRIME SCENES
IN ITS NEW STRATEGY THE HOME OFFICE ACKNOWLEDGES FORENSIC SCIENCE PROVISION HAS BECOME FRAGMENTED IT SAYS DIGITAL ANALYSIS OF COMPUTERS AND SMARTPHONES IS BEING CONDUCTED IN AN AD HOC MANNER WHICH DOESN'T PROVIDE VALUE FOR MONEY
AS A RESULT MINISTERS SAY THEY'RE SUPPORTING A REVIEW BY POLICE OF THE CASE FOR A JOINT FORENSIC AND BIOMETRIC SERVICE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE INCREASED CAPABILITY AND RESILIENCE
THE DENNIS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE BRITISH ROCK MUSICIAN KEITH EMERSON IS BEING TREATED BY POLICE AS SUICIDE HIS BODY WAS FOUND BY HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THEIR HOME IN SANTA MONICA IT'S THOUGHT HE HAD SHOT HIMSELF
KEITH EMERSON WAS REVERED BY THE MUSICIANS AS THE MOST SKILFUL KEYBOARD PLAYER IN POPULAR MUSIC AT HOME ON PIANO ELECTRIC ORGAN AND AN EVER EXPANDING RANGE OF SYNTHESISERS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER WERE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GROUPS IN THE WORLD GIVE SOME FELT THERE WAS A SPECIAL MAGIC WHEN THEY PLAY TOGETHER
PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO STICK LABELS ON THE BAND IN FACT IT WAS QUITE
IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES WE WERE REFERRED TO AS A HEAVY METAL
REALLY IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE MUSIC WE CAN'T BE VERY SYMPHONIC SO ROCK SYMPHONIC IF YOU WERE TO PUT A LABEL ON IT BUT I FIND THAT WE TACK IT IS
THERE'S EVERYTHING IN IT WE ARE THREE MUSICIANS ENJOY PLAYING MUSIC AND THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY
VENISON HAS DIED IN CALIFORNIA
THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S HEAR MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS IN CHICAGO OVERNIGHT IT'S UNUSUAL FOR AN AMERICAN POLITICAL RALLY TO BE CANCELLED BECAUSE OF PROTESTS BUT THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED AT THE TRUMP RALLY PLAN FOR CHICAGO AND FIGHTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF BY THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER IN THE RACE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION BUT A MELEE AS I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO OUR CORRESPONDENT LAURA BECAUSE IN WASHINGTON
WELL IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A POLITICAL RALLY AND STARED IN THE TIMES MORE LIKE A BAR ROOM BRAWL IN SAY THE VENUE THEY WERE A SCUFFLE WAS BREAKING OUT NO CORNERS BETWEEN SUPPORTERS BETWEEN PROTESTERS THEY WERE GRABBING AT THE SEINE C. WERE CARRYING THERE WAS PUSHING THEY WERE SHOVING THEY WERE SHOW TIMMY WAS POINTING REAL RAW ANGER THERE WAS SOME ATTEMPT AT CONTROL BY THE SECURITY STAFF BUT IT REALLY WAS TO NO AVAIL THE DEMONSTRATORS HAD BEEN GATHERING FOR HOURS
SINCE THE EARLY MORNING SOME HAD MARCHED IN HUGE NUMBERS TO THE VENUE OR CHANTING ANTI TRUMP SLOGANS BUT IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THIS WAS PRE PLANNED IT WAS ORGANISED OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS BY CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP IF HE HAD WANTED TO DISRUPT THIS DONALD TRUMP RALLY AND THEY SUCCEEDED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AERIAL SHOTS OF CHICAGO THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINING THE STREETS AND THE TENSION WAS CLEAR AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY
BUT THE PROTESTS AT THESE RALLIES ARE NOT NEW BUT THIS REALLY HAS THIS A BIG INCREASE IN SCALE AND WHAT THE PROTESTERS WILL SAY AT LEAST SOME OF THEM IS THAT VIOLENCE AT THESE RALLIES HAS BEEN
ENCOURAGED ACTUALLY BY THE CANDIDATE AND THAT HIS OWN PEOPLE IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF DEALING HARSHLY WITH PROTEST THAT'S RIGHT THEY ARE ANGRY AT THE TORN AND THE RHETORIC OF HIS CAMPAIGN AND AFTER ONE OF HIS SUPPORTERS WAS ARRESTED FOR PUNCHING A PROTEST CAMPAIGN EVENTS IN NORTH CAROLINA
DONALD TRUMP JUST SAID THAT IT WAS THE PROTESTERS THAT WERE BAD DUDES I'M OUT THESE CAN OFTEN ROCK STAR LIKE RALLIES THERE'S AN ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE BEGINNING URGING FANS NOT TO BE VIOLENT TOWARDS PROTESTERS BUT THIS IS THE SAME DONALD TRUMP WHO HAS IN THE PAST SAID HE PERSONALLY WANTED TO PUNCH A PROTESTER BUT HE DENIES THAT THIS TORN THIS RHETORIC IS TO BLAME INSTEAD HE SAYS VOTERS ARE ANGRY
SO MUCH ANGER IN THE COUNTRY AND THEN IT'S JUST ANGER IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S NOT DIRECT
WHEN YOU STARTED IT ME OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST DIRECTED AT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
IT'S A DOUBLE IT'S A DOUBLE SLEPT
THAT ARE VERY VERY UPSET ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE COUNTRY AS A COUNTRY
OTHER PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT PLAYING CERTAINLY DOES SHE BORE OUTSIDE GET MORE COMING INSIDE
AND GO ROUND AND HAVE A BROTHER THAT THEY HAVING EVERYBODY GET IN
MIXED IT UP I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
COME ON PARCHMENT I I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING
I WAS TOLD AS WELL I THINK THE QUESTION THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS WILL THIS HURT HIS CAMPAIGN WELL IT MAY NOT NOTHING OVER DOES IT REALLY DOESN'T THAT MEAN HE COULD COME ACROSS AS THE CANDIDATE HE WAS DENIED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK AT HIS OWN POLITICAL EVENT WHICH ACTUALLY I MEAN GOOD TO BE THAT IS THE CASE REALLY ISN'T IT WHY DO YOU HAVE AN EVENT AND PEOPLE STOPPED EXACTLY THAT'S HOW IT WORKS CERTAINLY TO ME
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE SOME FORTRESS INCUBATE FUTURE DEMONSTRATIONS IS THIS THE MARK OF HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IF IT CAME TO A GENERAL ELECTION AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THIS COIN TASTE OF ANGRY AMERICANS ARE THERE MORE OF HIS SUPPORTERS EAGER TO VOTE OR ARE THERE MORE PROTESTERS READY TO VOTE FOR ANYONE BUT HIM
LAURA REBECCA IN WASHINGTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CHANCELLOR HAS MORE BENEFIT CUTS ARE LINED UP AND IT SEEMS THEY WILL HIT DISABILITY PAYMENTS I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY DAME ANNE BEGG FORMER LABOUR M.P. USED TO CHAIR THE WORK AND PENSIONS COMMITTEE USES A WHEELCHAIR HERSELF GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHAT D'YOU THINK IT WILL MEAN THEY WILL MEAN THESE CUTS
I'VE ARE FORMING SOMETHING CALLED THE DISPLAY ELEVEN A LOUNGE AND INTRODUCING SOMETHING NEW CALLED THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PUMAS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MEET THIS EVENING'S IT'S REPEATED EVERY REALLY STARTED IT ALL ROUND RATHER THAN LOOKING AT WHAT PEOPLE NEEDED AND THE MONEY THAT HE SHOULD GET IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THEY LIT COVERING THE EXTRA BECAUSE OF DISABILITY THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED HALF A MILLION
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE PEOPLE OF THE TATE IN THE COUNTRY A LOT SO SHE'LL APPLICABLE QUALIFY THERE'S NO LOGIC TO THAT AND MUM THAT'S NOT IF YOU THINK THAT THEY DESERVE TO CALL THE FIRST INSIGHTS GENIUS THAT IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS BASICALLY DONE IS HE'S HE'S NOW DOING THE GIG WE CERTAINLY HARDER THAN THAT WE GET THE BENEFIT IT'S INTERESTING THAT ONCE HE DREW UP THE CLAY AND THE DESCRIPTORS REPAIRED THE FELLING THAT MORE PEOPLE WERE QUALIFIED
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS THE PRESUMABLY WILL SURELY IS THAT PEOPLE WHO REALLY REALLY NEED THESE PAYMENTS SHOULD GET THEM ARE YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED THEM WILL NOT BE GETTING THEM AT THAT THEREFORE THEIR LIVES BUT THEY WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT WELL PEOPLE AT THE MOMENT IT ALL OF THAT
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WITH MORE DIRECTLY WENT EVERYWHERE
UNDER THE OLDEST FAMOUS ONLY THEY DESERVE UNDER THE NEW PETS ARE INDEPENDENCE IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET AN IDEA IN PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT IT MEANS I MEAN YOU
HAVE TO USE A WHEELCHAIR SO THEREFORE DO CLEARLY HAVE A DISABILITY CLEARLY THEREFORE YOU QUALIFY WHAT IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE TO USE A STICK TO WALK OVER THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO BE SAYING CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT IF YOU HAVE A STICK AND YOU CAN WALK WITH A STICK THEN THAT THEN YOU'RE NOT DISABLED IN THAT SENSE YOU DON'T NEED IT IS THAT RIGHT
RIGHT LIPPY AT LIPPARD PERSONAL INDEPENDENTLY AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT FOOD AND IT NEEDS A FEAT IN THE SHELL IF YOU HEAR THAT WE'RE GOING BOOKSELLER BUT THEY DO NEED TO SIT DOWN
HE MEANT SENSIBLE I DON'T DOUBT THAT FOAM SENSIBLE BUT THINGS LIKE NEEDING A FEAT TO SLIP IN THE SHOWER IT ACTS AS A PROXY IS THAT PROBABLY ALSO MEANS THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO SOME HOUSEHOLD CHORES
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE WAS ALMOST UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT IN THE LORDS YESTERDAY THAT ELECTRONIC SLOT MACHINES KNOWN AS FIXED ODDS BETTING TERMINALS FOB TEAS FOR SHORT WERE DANGEROUSLY ADDICTIVE AND A SOCIAL BLIGHT OUR PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT MARK DARCY
YOU ONLY GET THIS SORT OF THING IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS THERE SOME EMBARRASSMENT I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I THINK I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY MEMBER OF YOUR LORDSHIP'S HOUSE WAS EVER RUN A CASINO
WAS PROBABLY ALMOST AS BAD AS ADMITTING TO HAVING TO RUN THE BORDELLO WHICH ACTOR'S EYES I HAVE NOT
THAT WAS THE CONSERVATIVE PEER LORD JAMES HAVE BLACK HEATH SPEAKING DURING A LORDS DEBATE ON TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS ON FIXED ODDS BETTING TERMINALS OR FOB TEAS CALLED BY THE CRITICS THE CRACK COCAINE OF GAMBLING LORD JAMES WHO FASCINATED THE HOUSE WITH A DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO RIG A ROULETTE WHEEL USING ONLY BEESWAX SUSPECTED THAT THE ELECTRONIC VERSION OF ROOM IT COULD ALSO BE UNFAIR
THE WHOLE OF THE MACHINES IS ONE GREAT
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE SOFTWARE IS STARE OR BALANCE IN FAVOUR OF A FAIR GAME BETWEEN THE PUNTER AND THE GEESE AND THE CASINO
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LORD CLEMENT JONES HAD PROPOSED A BILL TO REDUCE THE STEAK GAMBLES COULD PUT INTO THE MACHINES FROM ONE HUNDRED POUNDS TO TWO POUNDS HE SAID THEY WERE DANGEROUSLY ADDICTIVE AND THEY'VE BEEN WARNINGS WHEN THEY WERE FIRST PERMITTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AS THAT THEN CULTURE SECRETARY HAD ADMITTED BARONESS JOEL'S STATED AT THE TIME THAT IF EVIDENCE OF HARM EMERGED THAT ONE HUNDRED POUND STAKE COULD BE REDUCED AS FORTIES WERE ON PROBATION
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE EXPERIMENT TO ALLOW HIGH SPEED ROULETTE IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE BETTING SHOPS MY LORD'S HAS BEEN A DISASTER
THEY WERE DANGEROUS TO SOCIETY AND TO INDIVIDUAL SEE SAD REALITY IS THAT THESE MACHINES ARE HIGHLY DANGEROUS PRODUCTS WHICH ARE A CATALYST FOR PROBLEM GAMBLING SOCIAL BREAKDOWN AND SERIOUS CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
JUST TAKE THE CASE OF A GAMBLER IN LEEDS WHO WAS SENTENCED TO A TWO YEAR SENTENCE FOR ATTACKING A BETTING SHOP WORKER WITH A KNIFE
THE MAN HAD LOST ONE THOUSAND POUNDS PLAYING FOB TEAS MONEY THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE ON DEPOSIT
SHOULD BE A DEPOSIT ON A FLAT AND HE SAID HE WAS UTTERLY POSSESSED BY THE MACHINES FOR LABOUR PEER LORD LIVES HE BEGAN HIS SPEECH BY LISTING HIS RECENT BETTING SUCCESSES
FIRST THERE WAS MANY CLOUDS IN THE GRAND NATIONAL THIRTY THREE TO ONE
SECOND THERE WAS A LIB DEM TO GET LETH TEN SEATS AT THE GENERAL ELECTION
IN THE PLEASURE WITH BUSINESS THERE I'M LANDED WITH BIRTH AT SIXTEEN TO ME
THEN THEN THERE WAS JEREMY CORPULENT LABOUR LEADER
THAT WAS COMBINING PLEASURE WITH DISPLEASURE BUT HAVING DEMONSTRATED HE WAS NO PURITAN HE AGREED RESTRICTIONS WERE NEEDED
I AM PERSUADED THAT THE REGIME FOR THEIR FORTIES IS TURNING
THAT ONE HUNDRED POUNDS STATEMENT FIFTY MILES WITHOUT HUMAN INTER REACTION IS TO
BUT THE BOOKMAKING INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DEFENDING THE INDEFENSIBLE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ACTED WITH THE ENERGY OF A HIBERNATING SLOW
AND LABOUR'S LADY SHERLOCK FAULT FIXED ODDS MACHINES SHOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE IN A WELL SUPERVISED ENVIRONMENT MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT THESE HIGH STAKES FOB TO USE DO NOT BELONG ON THE HIGH STREET THEY ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE MACHINES WHICH THEY BUT IF THEY ARE TO BE OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL SHOULD BE LOCATED IN THE LARGE WELL
PROPERLY REGULATED CASINO ENVIRONMENTS NOT IN BETTING SHOPS IN POOR NEIGHBOURHOODS WITH ONE MEMBER OF STAFF BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO CAN'T POSSIBLY MONITOR CUSTOMER BETTING AND CAN'T COME OUT TO ADDRESS IT IF SHE DID MY LORDS WE NEED SOME ACTION
FOR THE GOVERNMENT LORD COURT TOWN SAID MINISTERS HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE BILL BUT KEPT THE ISSUE OF FIXED ODDS GAMBLING MACHINES UNDER REVIEW GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE PROBLEM
WHICH HAS REMAINED AT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE ADULT POPULATION IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE PRODUCT OR ONE ISSUE SUCH A STATESIDE MAKING CHANGES TO BE TWO STEAKS
RETIRED THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDS WHEN TRYING TO PROMOTE A COMPREHENSIVE SENSITIVE AS IS CUSTOMARY IN THE LORDS THE BILL WAS GIVEN AN UNOPPOSED SECOND READING BUT THIS LATE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR IT HAS LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING MORE THE DICE YOU MIGHT SAY A DECISIVELY LOADED AGAINST IT
THAT WAS MARK DARCY REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT MORE OF THAT JUST DRAFT TO TEN TO NINE ON RADIO FOUR
NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN JONNY WILKINSON CALLS HIM A GENIUS AND SAYS HE CHANGED HIS LIFE KICKING COACH DAVE ALDRED TIS AMONG THOSE BACKROOM PEOPLE WHO POWER RUGBY UNION AND OTHER SPORTS AS WELL HE'S ONE OF MILLIONS WILL BE WATCHING ENGLAND WALES TWICKENHAM'S AFTERNOON WALES OF COURSE IN A VERY STRONG FRAME OF MIND AFTER THEIR BRILLIANT DESTRUCTION OF ENGLAND IN THE WORLD CUP IN ENGLAND
LOOKING TOUGH AND NOW THEY'VE ALREADY KNOWS EDDIE JONES NEW ENGLAND COACH WELL ANDY KNOWS THE PLAYERS ASKED HIM WHO HE THOUGHT WOULD WIN
I REALLY DON'T KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLUSES AND MINUSES OR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BOTH SIDES I THINK WALES WILL HAVE A STRONGER SIDE THAN THEY HAD IN THE WORLD CUP THERE THEY WON'T FEAR TWICKENHAM
THEY SAY THEY'VE SORT OF GOT THAT MONKEY OFF THEIR BACK I THOUGHT WELL TRY A AND ME IN THE LAST
WHATEVER IT WAS THIRTY SECONDS OF THE GAME AGAINST ENGLAND I THINK HAD FRANCE SCORED IT WEIRDER SAID TYPICAL FRENCH ANS U.A. AND PANACHE AND FLAIR BUT I THOUGHT WALES DESERVED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CREDIT TO ACTUALLY HAVE A SORT OF A WALKING WOUNDED IN THE SCRUM HALF ON THE WING THAT A PICK UP ON THE RUN I THOUGHT WAS
WAS SENSATIONAL PIECE OF RUGBY AND TO A PERSON WHO WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE SPECTACLE WHAT A GREAT SPECTACLE THE GAME WAS HAVING SAID THAT ENGLAND HAVE YOU NO TAKEN ON THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY RESPONDED TO THAT NOW BY ALL ACCOUNTS THEY'RE DOING PARTICULARLY WELL
KNOWING EDDIE JONES AS I DO HE WOULD NOT BE HE WON'T STAND ON CEREMONY IF IF HE DOESN'T FEEL THAT THEY ARE ADHERING TO THE PROCESSORS AND PUTTING IN THE EFFORT AND I THINK BOTH COACHES WILL BE WANTING A GOOD PERFORMANCE AND PROBABLY THE WINNING OR LOSING ALL OF IT IS GOING TO BE IN THE LAP OF THE PLAYERS DO YOU THINK THOUGH THE EDDIE JONES DIFFERENCE MIGHT JUST DO IT FOR ENGLAND
I I REALLY DON'T KNOW I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ENGLAND WILL PLAY BETTER BIG BIG BECAUSE OF THE EDDIE JONES DIFFERENCE BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU SAY THAT WALES WE'VE GOT A STRONGER SIDE OUT THAN THEY HAD IN THE WORLD CUP I JUST WONDERED WHERE THE ENGLAND PLAYERS AND HAVING SEEN HIM UP CLOSE WITH THE PLAYERS AND KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT YOU JAMES HE'S QUITE A FRIGHTENING PERSON ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE A PLAYER AND YOU'RE WORKING FOR AND I JUST WONDER WHETHER THAT IN WITH YOUR GREAT EXPERIENCE OF RUGBY AT HOW YOU COACH AND ALL THE REST OF IT OBVIOUSLY JUST FRIGHTENING THE PLAYERS IN THE PLANE BETTER HE'S NOT
PROBABLY THE SOPHISTICATED COACHING ANSWER BUT IT MIGHT BE PART OF IT WELL I I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT HE DOES ENGENDER FEAR AND THEN I WORKED WITH EDDIE I MEAN THERE IS EH
IT IS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR LINE IN THE SAND WHICH IS A GOOD THING BUT HOWEVER HE DOES PROVIDE THE PROCESS AND THE EXPERIENCE FOR ALLOW THE PLAYERS TO DEVELOP
AND I THINK THAT'S THE THING AND THAT AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT I MAKE THAT SOMETIMES HE YOU KNOW WHAT THE MEDIA C. IS A SMALL TIP OF THE ICEBERG WHEN YOU SEE ALL THE OTHER BITS THAT GO ON AND HE'S GOT A FANTASTIC COACHES AND STEVE BORTHWICK AS WELL AND I JUST FEEL
AND ONE UP ONE THING THAT I KNOW ABOUT ANY JONES'S HE IS
UGH A CONSTANT STUDENT HE STILL LEARNING A MALE ADMITTED AND ALL GOOD COACHES TO ME STILL LEARN AND I THERE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE IN AUSTRALIA THAT'S GOT A PLAQUE ON HIS DESK AND IT SAYS THOSE WHO DARE TO COACH
SHOULD NEVER CEASED TO LEARN I THINK THAT EDDIE JONES IS THE EPITOME OF THAT THEY WERE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN AND WE SHALL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPORT SONALI RUGBY OR NO FOOTBALL BOTH BOTH WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE RUGBY BUT FIRST I SHOULD GIVE CRYSTAL PALACE MENTION THEY ARE THE FIRST TEAM INTO THE SEMI FINALS OF THE F.A.

I DO I MUST REESE'S MIND GAMES ARE JUST TRYING TO SLIGHTLY INFLUENCE THE REFEREE BEFORE THE GAME I MEAN IT'S BEEN QUITE QUIET ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF THE BUILD UP FROM THE TALK FROM THE COACHES FROM GUT AND FROM DRUMS BOTH REALLY LIKED TO WIND EACH OTHER UP AND TO WINE TEAMS UP BUT IT'S BEEN FAIRLY QUIET A LITTLE BIT OF TALK ABOUT SOME ILLEGAL SCRUMMAGE AND WITH A LITTLE BIT OF TALK ABOUT

KEITH EMERSON WHO PLAYED KEYBOARDS IN THE SEVENTIES GROUP EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER HAS DIED IN CALIFORNIA AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY ONE BUT HE SAY HE MAY HAVE SHOT HIMSELF HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MUSICIANS TO USE SYNTHESISERS AS ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENT
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT BARACK OBAMA AND DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD THIS WEEK TO THE DISASTER UNFOLDING IN LIBYA A DISASTER HE ATTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE FAILINGS OF DAVID CAMERON AND THE THEN FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY HAD STOPPED PAYING ATTENTION TO LIBYA AND ALLOW THE PLACE TO GO TO HELL WHICH IS CURRENTLY WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE NO GOVERNMENT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE GETTING A TOEHOLD MILITIAS CONTROLLING INDIVIDUAL CITIES
OR PARTS OF CITIES WE ARE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY COLONEL RUPERT WHY LOCK WHO WAS THE SENIOR BRITISH MILITARY COMMANDER IN LIBYA IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND TWELVE AND MARTIN COBBLERS ON THE LINE IS THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL AND HEAD OF THE U.N. SUPPORT MISSION FOR LIBBY MONTY BOTH I'D COME ON MY LOVE FIRST OR DO YOU THINK OBAMA'S RIGHT THAT AT LEAST PART OF THE REASON LIBYA IS IN THE STATE THAT IT IS IN IS BECAUSE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS IN PARTICULAR JUST DIDN'T BOTHER WITH IT ONCE HAD A FIT GUY
I BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS RIGHT INASMUCH AS LIBYA IS A MESS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS RIGHT IN BLAMING I'VE EITHER EUROPEAN LEADERS OR INDEED DAVID CAMERON PERSONALLY
IT'S NOT A PERSONAL ISSUE IT'S VERY MUCH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WHICH SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE IN TERMS OF THE HER CIVILISATION OF LIBYA IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAMME'S SWITCH TO ASSIST THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT THEY'RE OUT THERE WERE SOME GOOD LINES OF ACTIVITY WHICH INCLUDED THE ASSISTANTS TO DEAL WITH THE REMNANTS OF WAR THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THE TECHNICAL TEAMS WHICH WENT IN TO HELP THE LIBYAN ARMED FORCES TO REBUILD
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT YOU HAD THERE WAS THE TUATH THE HER GUARDIANS OF THE REVOLUTION WERE NOT GIVEN MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT IN THE AFTERMATH THE DISAFFECTED YOUTH CONTINUE TO
BELIEVE IN A PATH OF VIOLENCE WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GOVERNMENT NOT BEING ABLE TO FORM A COALITION AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE NOT A CUPBOARD YOU AGREE WITH THAT ANALYSIS
WELL I AGREE I THINK WE ALL AGREE
AFTER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BECOMES BECAUSE THAT'S TO NO LASTLY AND ONE UP VERY WE JUST BUMPED UP TO YOU
COURSE THE MISTAKEN BUT LEFT THE COUNTRY INTO CHAOS RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO REPAIR IT NOW YES AND IF WE REPAIR AND I'LL GET TO THAT END IN A SECOND FROM THE U.N. PERSPECTIVE COLOUR ONE WHAT DO YOU THINK THE THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN QUICKLY
WELL APART FROM ANYTHING WE NEED THAT UNIFIED GOVERNMENT TO GET THE FULL SUPPORT OF ALL THE MILITIAS WHICH ARE WORKING IN LIBYA AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE A NUMBER WHICH MAY NOT HAVE JUST AS IN SYRIA YOU MAY NOT GET ALL OF THEM TO SIGN UP TO THE PEACE CAR BUT AT LEAST IF WE HAVE A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT THERE IS THAT IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT DOES THERE NEED TO BE A PHYSICAL INTERVENTION
FROM OUTSIDE ALBEIT AT THE INVITATION OF ONE OR OTHER OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BUT DO WE HAVE TO THE ITALIANS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT DOES THERE HAVE TO BE A KIND OF A PHYSICAL WORLD COMMUNITY MILITARY PRESENCE ON THE GROUND
EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNT IN LIBYA WHEN I WAS INDICATED THAT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PUT LARGE NUMBERS OF WESTERN FORCES ON THE GROUND IN NORTH AFRICA MY COBBLER DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT I TOTALLY AGREE
BRING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT UNITY EVERYBODY SAYS THAT WAY AN INTERVENTION THAT GROUND TROOPS WOULD BE A MISTAKE I REPENT THE PROBLEM WILL BE DICED THEN THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE WHICH IS
WITH ITS EXPENSIVE BUT WE HAVE OH WE WERE TALKING THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY ACTUALLY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ITALY LEADING A U.N. MANDATED FORCE INTO LIBYA IF THEY WERE INVITED TO YOU SAYING THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN
RAINING MISSION IS SOMETHING JUST A BIT HIM I NEED TIME YOU'VE GOT TO STAY IN THIS SO CALLED RIVULET OF ARMY AND BE THIS ISN'T A SLIGHT DEVA SAUDI TRUDGES A SLIGHTLY SEMANTIC DIFFERENCE THERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE TRAINING MISSIONS MORPH INTO OTHER KINDS OF MISSIONS AND WHATEVER YOU CALLED IT IT WOULD BE QUITE A LARGE GROUP FIVE THOUSAND OR SO FOREIGN TROOPS IN THERE
IF REQUESTED SO SPEAK STRANGELY I'M NUCLEAR CONSULTANTS AND TRAINERS AND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND KEEP FIGHTING GUYS GROUND TROOPS IN THE GULF SO DO YOU THINK COME ON BRITAIN SHOULD HAVE A AROMA MIST
I'M NOT I'M JUST ONE SECOND OUT MARTIN COLOUR ONE ONE MINUTE LET ME ASK KEN WHILE AT THAT READ FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE BRITISH SOLDIER A FORMER BRITISH SOLDIER WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ROLE SHOULD BE GIVEN ENORMOUS INVOLVEMENT IN GETTING RID OF GADDAFI BUT I BELIEVE THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES TO HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO SUPPORT THAT SMALL TEAMS AS WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
IN SPECIFIC TECHNICAL AREAS WE COULD WE COULD CERTAINLY HELP BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A LARGE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WITH INFANTRY LOOKING AT DO YOU TAKING UP SECURITY ROLLS IT'S GOT TO BE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS INDEED WHERE WE'RE DOING IN IRAQ AT THE MOMENT DO YOU THINK MARTIN COBBLER FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE
THAT THERE IS NOW THIS IS WHAT BARACK OBAMA WAS SAYING DID NOT EXIST IN A WAY THAT THE POLITICAL WILL
TO TAKE THE NECESSARY RISKS INVOLVED FOR FOREIGN POLITICIANS EUROPEAN AND OTHERS AND COMMIT PEOPLE AND COMMIT EFFORT TO SORT IN LIBYA
TO CITROEN MOMENT TO SUPPORT THAT IF YOU'LL STOP FIRST STEP IS
ARMY STRUCTURE BECAUSE UP HE FELT THREATENED BY ATTEMPT BRIGADE BRIGADE THEY'RE NEVER TOGETHER
KINSA AND THEN
THE OTHER THE OTHER THE OTHER POINT THAT SOME PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN WHILE I STOOD UP FOR A BRITISH OFFICER WHO WAS ONCE AN ATTACHE TO TO TO TRIPOLI MANY MANY YEARS AGO WERE SAYING ACTUALLY LIBYA IS HE'S FINISHED IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE RIVEN WITH WITH WITH CRISES AND ANIMOSITIES ONCE GADDAFI WENT AND E.T.'S FOOLISH HE WAS CLAIMING TO TRY TO BUILD IT BACK INTO ONE STATE
IT'S THE SEVENTEENTH LARGEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SAY IT'S ENORMOUS IT DWARFS IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND PARK WHEN IT WAS CREATED AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT WAS VERY MUCH DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS WE SIGN SINE A TRIPOLI TRIPOLI IN THERE
WEST AND THE FACADE IN THE SOUTH SO YOU CAN'T REALLY SIMPLIFY INTO INTO ONE OR TWO BITESIZE CHUNKS
WHEN WE WERE WHERE THERE WITH HER CAN IT BE A UNIFIED COUNTRY AGAIN THAT'S THE POINT THERE ARE THERE ARE A HUGE AMOUNT OF LIBYANS WHO WANT TO KEEP IT AS A SINGLE NATION AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD DO AND IT SHOULD BE HER CANNOT WHILE A CURRENT RUPERT WHY LOCK AND MARTIN COBBLER AS WELL FROM THE U.N. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS OUR TWENTY TONIGHT TO GO TO THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF PLANS TO SAVE MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS BY TWENTY TWENTY AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE DISABLED IS THE LEAD STORY IN THE TELEGRAPH HE SPECULATES THAT THE MOVE COULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR GEORGE OSBORNE TO CUT TAXES FOR THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN NEXT WEEK'S BUDGET DISABILITY CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE CUTS WILL BE DEVASTATING
TELEGRAPH CALLS FOR A TRUE BLUE BUDGET NOW IS THE TIME IT SAYS TO CONTROL SPENDING REDUCE WELFARE AND CUT TAXES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY FINANCIAL TIMES SO IS MISTER OSBORNE IS FACING AN EIGHTEEN BILLION POUNDS BLACK HOLE THAT IS OPENED UP IN THE ECONOMY SINCE NOVEMBER WHICH WILL COMPEL HIM TO TIGHTEN THE SQUEEZE ON PUBLIC SPENDING
THEY MIRROR FEATURES AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD BOY WITH CEREBRAL PALSY HE'S WRITTEN TO DAVID CAMERON TO ASK WHY THE N.H.S. WON'T FUND HIS REHABILITATION MIRROR READERS DONATED TWENTY THOUSAND FOR BEN BADLY TO HAVE SURGERY ON HIS SPINE AFTER AN N.H.S. OPERATION WAS CANCELLED BEN COMPLAINTS TO THE PRIME MINISTER THERE BECAUSE THE OPERATION WAS CARRIED OUT PRIVATELY THE N.H.S. IS REFUSING TO PAY FOR HIS PHYSIOTHERAPY AT THIS MEANS HIS FAMILY ARE CONSTANTLY FUNDRAISING COULD SORT THINGS OUT HE ARSE DOWNING STREET SAYS MY CAMERA WILL RESPOND WHEN HE SEEN THE LETTER
THE N.H.S. IS GOING TO SPEND MILLIONS ON BOILERS FOR PATIENTS' HOMES ACCORDING TO THE SUN DOUBLE GLAZING AND INSULATION WILL ALSO BE PROSCRIBED AS PART OF A THREE MILLION POUNDS GOVERNMENT BACKED SCHEME THE IDEA IS TO HELP THOSE WITH ILLNESSES MADE WORSE BY THE COLD OF SUCH AS HEART CONDITIONS AND LUNG DISEASES PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATISM ARTHRITIS AND ALLERGIES CAN ALSO BENEFIT A PILOT PROJECT IN SUNDERLAND INVOLVING SIX PATIENTS APPARENTLY LED TO A SIXTY PERCENT CUT
IN THEIR DEMAND FOR G.P. VISITS ACCORDING TO THE TIMES UKIP IS READY TO ROB LABOUR OF POWER IN WALES' LEADING ACADEMICS PREDICTS NIGEL FARAGE IS PARTY IS LIKELY TO HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER WITH UP TO NINE SEATS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AFTER ELECTIONS IN MAY IN AN EDITORIAL THE PAPER SAYS THAT WHILE THE RETREATS MAYBE LESS SPECTACULAR THAN IN SCOTLAND LABOUR IS WANING IN WALES TO THE NATION THAT JEREMY CORBIN HAS THE STAR QUALITY TO REVERSE THE PATTERN SEEMS FANCIFUL
THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WAR HORSE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PLAYS THIS COUNTRY HAD SEEN FOR MANY YEARS FINALLY COMES TO AN END IN LONDON TONIGHT IT'S A STORY OF A BOY AND HIS HORSE THE HORSE OF COURSE A WONDERFUL PUPPET AND IT WAS PRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL THEATRE THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK ON WHICH THE PLAY IS BASED IS MICHAEL MOORE POGO AND HE IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS WEEK'S MEET THE AUTHOR A REGULAR SLOT WILL A NEW REGULAR SLOT AS IT WERE RELATIVELY NEW ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES MET MICHAEL MOORE PUT
MICHAEL MOORE POGO IS THE AUTHOR OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BOOKS THE MOST FAMOUS BEING WAR HORSE WHICH HE WROTE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
IT TELLS THE STORY OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR THROUGH THE EYES OF JOEY I'LL FORCE IT WAS LATER TURNED INTO A PLAY AT THE NATIONAL THEATRE AND SINCE THEN IT'S BECOME AN INTERNATIONAL FOR
ALBERT NOW REPORT THEM SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT WE SHALL BE TOGETHER AGAIN
IT'S BEEN SEEN BY MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD TAKEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE AND WON COUNTLESS AWARDS
THE PLANE HAS RUN FOR SEVEN YEARS IN LONDON AND IT FINALLY COMES TO AN END THIS
ALL THOSE HAS BEEN GOOD TO YOU MICHAEL WILL POGO AND I WONDER HOW SORRY YOU ARE BUT IT'S COMING TO AN END IN THE WEST END
WELL I'M NOT SORRY AT ALL IT'S BEEN SO GOOD HOW COULD YOU BE SORRY AFTER WHEN I WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OF IT AND WHATEVER IS SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ARE SILLY YOU CAN'T BE SORRY I SHALL MISS IT FOR A BIT BUT THEN IT'S GOING ON TOUR IN A YEAR'S TIME AROUND THE U.K. SO IT'LL COME BACK AGAIN I THINK AND I HOPE IT'LL COME BACK TO LONDON
WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE WHEN YOU WERE FIRST APPROACH ABOUT TURNING THE BOOK INTO A PLAY DISBELIEF REALLY AND I HAVE TO SAY I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO IT WITH PUPPETS I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY YES I WAS RIGHT BEHIND HER RIGHT AT THE START I WAS BY THE FACT THAT WAS THE NATIONAL THEATRE BECAUSE THEY'RE DONE WONDERFUL
WORK WITH PHILIP PULLMAN'S BOOK SO I WAS VERY FLATTERED THEY WANT TO WALLS BUT THEN THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO PUPPETS I THOUGHT YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING PUPPETS THE FIRST TROUBLE WAR HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK SO I DID NOT HAVE FAITH UNTIL I SAW
THE PUPPETS AND ICE IN FACT I SAW A GIRAFFE WHICH THESE HANDSPRING PUPPET PEOPLE HAVE MADE WALKING ACROSS THE STUDIO FLOOR AND I FOUND MYSELF CRYING AND I WAS THINKING WHAT SCUSE ME THIS IS NOT EVEN A REAL GIRAFFE IT'S A PROPER GIRAFFE AND SOMEHOW IT WAS SO EXTRAORDINARILY MOVING
THIS KIND OF CONNECTION BETWEEN US UNDER AND SENT INTO BEASTS
I THOUGHT IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND THE REST AS THEY SAY IS HISTORY LET'S TAKE YOU BACK TO THE EARLY EIGHTIES WHEN YOU WROTE THIS BOOK WHERE DID THE IDEA FIRST COME
WHEN I WAS LIVING IN DEVON OR MOVED TO DEVON WITH MY FAMILY AND I'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE AMONGST THEM ARE THREE OLD MEN WHO'D BEEN ALIVE AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST OF TWO OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE AND I GOT TALKING TO THEM AND ONE OF THEM TOLD ME ONE DAY HE'D BEEN WITH HORSES
AND IT WAS A CONVERSATION ACCOMMODATION JUST WENT ON AND ON AND HE THEN BECAME THEN BECAME A MONOLOGUE AND IT WAS ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND IT WAS FASCINATING FOR ME COS I OF COURSE I'D LIKE SO MANY I'D READ MY FIRST ROBOROUGH WAR POETS
THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT A LOVELY WAR I'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT HERE I WAS SITTING ACROSS THE FAR SIDE AT MY LOCAL PUB TALKING TO SOMEBODY ACTUALLY BEEN THERE AND I WAS
BLOWN AWAY AS THE MODERN EXPRESSION I THINK BY I SUPPOSE THE SIMPLICITY OF WHAT HE SAID THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT IS THE CRUELTY OF IT ALL AND I JUST WENT HOME AND I COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE AND CAN'T THINK OF NOTHING ELSE AND THEN RANG UP INTO A WARMING
ASK THEM HOW MANY HORSES ARE GOING TO THE FIRST WORLD WAR THEY SAID ABOUT A MILLION FROM THIS THE SHORT AND I SAID HOW MANY CAME
HE SAID SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AS WELL AS BEING TURNED INTO A THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE IT WAS ALSO TURNED INTO A FILM DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG WHY DO YOU THINK THAT DIDN'T ACHIEVE QUITE THE SAME LEVEL OF SUCCESS
I THINK COMMERCIALLY IT DID CRITICALLY DIDN'T AND I I THINK THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND IT'S A VERY STRANGE REASON THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
THE PUPPETS ON THE STAGE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PUPPETEERS WORKED ON THE EXPERTISE THEY HAD THIS BREATHING OF LIFE INTO A PUPPET
WHICH SOMEHOW TOUCHES THE AUDIENCE IN A WAY WHICH I STILL I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEN IT LEAVES THE AUDIENCE THE ROOM TO IMAGINE THE PROBLEM WITH THE FILM OF WAR HORSE AND DID MANY MANY FILMS IS IT SAYS IT ALL THIS WAS ONE OF YOUR EARLIEST BOOKS YOU'VE WRITTEN DOZENS SINCE THEN HOW COMFORTABLE DO YOU FEEL WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS FOR BOOK THERE WERE ALWAYS DEFYING YOU OH I DON'T MY FOR GOODNESS SAKE TO BE DEFINED
BUTKUS PIECES IT'S AS GOOD AS ANYTHING I'D FAR RATHER THAT THAN A NAME I MEAN IF YOU'RE SO MANY OF THE BOOKS WE KNOW WE LOVE AND WE GROW UP WITH YOU NO WIND IN THE WILLOWS YOU HAVE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU
REMEMBER WHO WROTE IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN WINNIE THE POOH ALL RIGHT I MEAN I KNOW BUT YOU DO HAVE TO THINK AND I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL IT IS THE
STUPID THAT HIT ME AND HERE IS THE BOOK AND OUTWARDS WHAT'S REALLY LOVELY IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER BOOKS THIS IS MY WIFE'S FAVOURITE BOOK AND THAT IT THAT IRKS ME BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS SAID IT WAS GOOD
AND HER FAVOURITE AND SHE STILL SAYS IT'S THE BEST BOOK OF THE WRITTEN AND THAT IS SOME EIGHTY BOOKS LATER COME HELP
COME ON PERK OUT TALKING TO REBEKAH JONES A TIME THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND A SOUTHAMPTON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS BRIAN DRAPER ASSOCIATE LECTURER AT THE LONDON INSTITUTE FOR CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I WONDER WHICH SONG DO YOU DUSTED OFF THIS WEEK EITHER IN YOUR OWN MIND OR IN YOUR RECORD COLLECTION WHEN YOU HEARD THAT GEORGE MARTIN HAD DIED
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN I'M WALKING BACKWARDS FOR CHRISTMAS BY THE GOONS THAT TWO CONTAINS MUCH EVIDENCE OF SIR GEORGE'S MUSICAL GENIUS BUT IT'S BEEN MOVING TO HEAR SO MANY BEATLES TRACKS IN PARTICULAR PLAYED THIS WEEK WEAKER FAB REMINDER OF JUST HOW INFLUENTIAL THEIR PRODUCER WAS
THE ROLE OF PRODUCER WHICH SIR GEORGE HELPED TO SHAPE SO HEAVILY IS AN INTRIGUING ONE I'VE BEEN LUCKY TO INTERVIEW SOME OF THE BEST TO HAVE WORKED WITH YOU TO ONE OF THEM BEING STEVE LILLYWHITE AND HE DESCRIBED THE PROCESS OF HELPING TO DRAW ALONGSIDE A BAND AND TURN UNFORMED IDEAS TOGETHER INTO CLASSIC SONGS AS MAGICAL AND MYSTICAL
IT'S A DEEP THING THEN AND IT'S VERY PERSONAL TO LILY WHITE TOLD ME HE SET UP A PING PONG TABLE FOR YOU TO WHEN THEY GOT BOGGED DOWN ON ONE EARLY ALBUM TO BREAK THROUGH THEIR NURSE GEORGE MARTIN CONFESSED IN INTERVIEWS THAT IT WASN'T TALENT HE FIRST SPOTTED IN THE BEATLES BUT PERSONALITY HE LIKED WHO THEY WERE AND SENSED HE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH
PERHAPS ABOVE ALL WHEN IT COMES TO INFLUENCE AS A PRODUCER THE GUITARIST BERNARD BUTLER PUT IT RATHER WELL THIS WEEK WHEN HE SAID THAT WHAT GEORGE MARTIN DID WAS TO ASK WHAT
HE WAS LIKE AN IMPRESSIONIST PAINTER HE CONTINUED SQUINTING HIS EYE AND IMAGINING WHAT COULD BE
THE POET AND PRIEST JOHNNY DONNY HE WRITES THAT THE IMAGINATION IS THE GREAT FRIEND OF POSSIBILITY WHERE IT'S AWAKENED ALIVE IT INVITES YOU TO NEW THRESHOLDS OF CREATIVITY
GEORGE MARTIN WAS MOST CERTAINLY ALIVE TO THE BEATLES AND TOOK THEM AND POPULAR MUSIC WITH HIM OVER THE THRESHOLD WE WERE A CREATIVE TEAM HE SAID ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SLIGHTLY OUT OF REACH
ALCHEMY IS ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THE COLLABORATIVE RESULT PERE CORRIE SIS THE GREEK WORD FOR ROTATION IS ANOTHER IT'S USED BY THEOLOGIANS TO DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THE HOLY TRINITY NOT LENNON MCCARTNEY AND MARTYN THIS TIME BUT FATHER SON AND HOLY SPIRIT EACH UNIQUELY AND DISTINCTLY EXPRESSED YET SHARING PROFOUNDLY MYSTERIOUSLY IN THE LIFE OF THE OTHERS AND CREATING MORE THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS
IT'S COMMUNION AND A MODEL OF HOW WE ALL COULD LIVE AND WORK AT BEST TOGETHER SQUINTING OUR EYES PERHAPS ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT F. AND RELEASING EACH OTHER TO PRODUCE MORE FULLY IMAGINED EXPRESSIONS OF WHO WE CAN BE BEYOND THE THRESHOLD
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BRIAN DRAPER THE TIME STENT AWAY HINKLEY POINT WILL BE BRITAIN'S BIGGEST NUCLEAR POWER STATION IT'LL SUPPLIES SEVEN PER CENT OF THE NATION'S ELECTRICITY IF IT GOES AHEAD AND THAT SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASINGLY BIG IF THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IS THE FRENCH COMPANY THERE'S MEANT TO BE BUILDING IT E.D.F. SAID IT WON'T GO AHEAD UNLESS THEY GET MORE MONEY WELL I'M JOINED BY ANGUS MACNEIL
CHAIRMAN OF THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE COMMITTEE S.N.P. M.P. AND HERE IN THE STUDIO BY OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK RUSSELL IS A FEW YEARS I WAS THE BOSS OF E.D.F. HAS WRITTEN A LETTER TO HER STAFF THEY'RE SAYING LISTEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO AHEAD UNLESS WE GET SOME REASSURANCES FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT NOW IMAGINE IF BRITISH GAS OR ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA WENT BUST BECAUSE IT WAS BUILDING A BIT OFF
TOO MUCH MORE THAN HE COULD CHEW BUILDING A FRENCH POWER RANGER WOULDN'T KNOW OR EVEN THE N.H.S. NEEDED GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE IT WAS BUILDING A PRIVATE FRENCH MAKE A HOSPITAL OR JUST IMAGINE THAT REVERSE BECAUSE IN A WAY THIS IS THE CAR THE CHOICE THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAS IT WILL BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE POWER STATION EVER MADE THE UNIONS DON'T LIKE IT IN FACT THE THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE THE EQUIVALENT IN IN FRANCE HAD NOT
DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HER THAT WAS NICE THE ONLY THING THEY THOUGHT WAS GOOD ABOUT IT WAS THE HIGH PRICE THEY MANAGED TO EXTRACT FROM THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT FOR THE ELECTRICITY IT WILL ULTIMATELY PRODUCE ABOUT A HUGE RATS GIVE ME NINETY TWO POUNDS PER MEGAWATT HOUR THAT'S TRIPLE WHAT THE WHOLESALE COST IS AT THE MOMENT SO LOTS OF PEOPLE SAYING
THERE ARE REASONS WHY THEY SHOULDN'T GO AHEAD HOWEVER THAT WHAT THEY'RE NOT SAYING IS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS PUT UP MORE MONEY WE NEED THEIR CO OPERATION TO RAISE A BIT OF CASH AND THAT COMES IN SEVERAL FORMS FOR EXAMPLE PAYING THE DIVIDEND IS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OWNED BY THE FRENCH GO ON PAYING THE DIVIDENDS TO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IN SHARES RATHER THAN CASH FREEING UP A BIT MORE CASH
AND POSSIBLY SELLING OFF THE FRENCH EQUIVALENT OR A STAKE IN IT THE FRENCH EQUIVALENT OF NATIONAL GRID WHICH IT SO IT'S GOING DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA TRY TO FIND AS MUCH CASH AS IT POSSIBLY CAN COS IT'S GOING TO NEED A LOT TO GET THIS PROJECT COMPLETE AND THE MOMENT I THINK STAND THIS DEAL AND E.D.F. ARE SAYING THIS DEAL IS STILL ON
STILL ON SHOULD IT BE ANGUS MACNEIL GONNIE DO WE WHAT PUT ASIDE THE FRENCH INTERESTS AND AS SIMON SAYS THEY WERE ENORMOUS OUR OWN INTEREST THIS ISN'T IN OUR INTEREST IS IT WELL IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE DEAL INDEED IT'S NINETY TWO POINT FIFTY PER MEGAWATT EACH AND EVERY YEAR FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS BUT OF COURSE HE SAID AND THE KIND OF CONTEXT THAT NUCLEAR POWER HAS BEEN GENERATING FROSTS FOR SIXTY YEARS IS NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY AT ALL ALSO PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF SWANSEA BAY THAT ARE LOOKING FOR AND FOR NINETY SIX POUNDS FOR
FOR NINETY YEARS SO YOU START TO SEE THAT THAT NUCLEAR AS READY AS IT'S QUESTIONS HE'S GOT US QUESTIONS FINANCIALLY IT'S SHE COULD HUGE QUESTIONS HE HAD ON THIS DESIGN AS WELL TECHNOLOGICALLY DOESN'T WORK DOES IT WELL THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT OF THE FOUR THAT CONSTRUCTION AT THE MOMENT ON CUE TWO IN FINLAND IN THE TWO AND TAE SHANNON CHINA THE FAME AS ONE OF FLAMMABLE VILLAIN FRANCE RICHARD
PROBLEM SIR BUT BUT FOOD FRENCH NUCLEAR INSPECTOR SAID HE'D HAD A PROBLEM ON THE VALVES THAT COULD LEAD TO A MELTDOWN IT WAS WAS WAS THAT WAS THE CONCERN UNDERSTAND SO THAT HAS LED TO MAJOR DELAYS IN THOSE FOOT IN THOSE FORD PROJECT AND APPARENTLY THERE ARE NO MORE PLANNED AFTER THIS IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED INTO VERY VERY CAREFULLY AND VERY VERY SOON BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE OBLIGATION AND THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF EGGS IN A QUITE SMALL BASKETS ALMOST AND GIVEN ALL THIS SIMON WHY ARE THEY GO
PERSISTED WITH HIS FACE SAVING OR WHAT WELL WHEN I SAY THEY I MEAN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IT'S A MASSIVE COMMITMENT THEY THINK IF YOU BELIEVE THAT OUR ENERGY NEEDS ARE BEST SERVED BY A MIX AND THAT NICOLA IS A PART OF THAT MIX AND THEY SAY THIS STILL MAKES SENSE I'M GOING NUCLEAR
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THAT POINT ABOUT THAT THE DELAYS THEY'VE HAD ELSEWHERE E.D.F. ACCOMPANY HER SAYING LOOK KNOW THIS IS FOURTH TIME LUCKY IF YOU LIKE WE'VE LEARNT FROM ALL OF THESE MISTAKES AND WE'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME IN THIS REACTOR IS EVOLUTIONARY AND THEY SAID WHICH MEANS IT'S A BIT NEW AND IT MIGHT BE A BIT UNTRIED AND UNTESTED BUT THEY THINK THE DESIGN'S GOING TO WORK THEY'VE LEARNT FROM THEIR MISTAKES AND THEY CAN GET IT DONE AND TO BE FAIR WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
AND ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE GOING TO BE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY THIRTY SO YOU NEVER KNOW MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE A REASONABLE PRICE AND THAT AND THAT IS A BIG FACTOR ANGUS MACNEIL ISN'T IT WE CAN'T MEASURE IT ON WHAT ENERGY COSTS NOW ARE MADE AND LOOK AT THE COST OF OIL NO FOR INSTANCE
ABSOLUTELY ENERGY COSTS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME WHICH IS MAYBE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SUDDEN LURCH A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND ON ONSHORE WIND AND SOLAR HAVE HAVE A HUGE IMPACT I THINK YOU CAN YOU CLEAR ON THIS PROJECT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AS BEST IT CAN HAS BEEN BOTH NUCLEAR IN HINCKLEY
SOME CONTEXT TO THE COMMITTEE WERE IN DENMARK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THE THE RENEWABLES ALONG WITH THE RENEWABLE WIND OF DENMARK ALONG WITH THE DISPATCH OF OF NORWAY HAD PUT A SWEDISH NUCLEAR PLANT THAT HAD BEEN REFURBISHED ON ON HOLD THEY DECIDED NOT TO GO ON WITH THE GIN GENERATION AT ALL SUCH WAS THE COMPETITION AND THE LOW ENERGY PLACES COURSE BUT THESE SOURCES
THAT TAKE THAT SAID THOUGH SOME PEOPLE STILL FEEL THE DANES ARE RELYING ON SOME OF THAT BASE LORD FROM CZECH NUCLEAR CONFIDENTIALLY SO IT'S QUITE A COMPLEX PICTURE BUT IT'S A PICTURE WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO AND THE POLITICS OF THIS THE CHINESE INVOLVED OFFENSIVE ALL THE U.K. INVOLVED AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AS OTHER PLACES THEY HAVE DECIDED NOT TO GO AHEAD WITH THE STUFF IT HAS THEY HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD IT'S FOR THE BEST OF MITES YOUR COMMITTEE COME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF NO LET'S PULL OUT OF THE DEAL
I WOULDN'T THINK VIC THE COMMITTEE HAD A BODY OF ELEVEN PEOPLE I WOULD NOT BUT I WANTED TO CHECK THAT BUT THAT IS POSSIBLE THE COMMITTEE COULD SEE THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD ALSO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO SEE THIS CONTINUE WITH CAVEATS OR WHATEVER BUT WE WILL BE EVIDENCE LED US A COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN
POLITICAL BASIS IF YOU LIKE I MYSELF PERSONALLY OFTEN VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH NUCLEAR BUT OTHER OTHER OTHER THAN THAT I CAN ONLY I'M ONLY ONE PERSON ON THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK WE WE WILL GO ON WITH WHERE THE EVIDENCE TAKES US AND HAVE THE EVIDENCE TAKES US TO SEE HIS EX WHERE IS IT I WOULD HOPE WOULD BE FEARLESS AND SEEING X. WHERE HE SAID SON I JUST THE FINAL THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THERE'S A BIG BOARD MEETING E.D.F. COMING UP ON MARCH THIRTIETH BUT ULTIMATELY
INTERESTINGLY THIS CENTRAL PLANK OF U.K. ENERGY POLICY WILL ULTIMATELY BE A DECISION FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AS A FINAL POINT IT AS WELL IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME THAT IN THE U.K. TORY GOVERNMENT OF BEING LECTURED BY FRENCH TEACHER UNIONS ON THEIR FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES IT'S AMUSING ASIDE BUT WELL THE CHELSEA MOTHER BEING ON ONE LEVEL BUT DEADLY SERIOUS VERY JUST CHRIS COULD WE PULL OUT SIMON IF WE DID WHAT IT COSTS A FORTUNE
WELL I WAS MARRIED TO THE F. TO YESTERDAY SAID NO IT WOULDN'T I THOUGHT WE COULD POSSIBLY PULL OUT I THINK WE COULD DO THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE ONE TO PULL THE PLUG THEY ARE UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO RENEW OUR AGEING ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S A CENTRAL PIECE OF IT THEY PUT A LOT OF STORE BY IT TO PULL OUT WOULD BE DEEPLY EMBARRASSING SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ANGUS MACNEIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMONS ENERGY COMMITTEE ANGUS MACNEIL OF THE P. TOLD US THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PAUSE BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO GO AHEAD WITH HINKLEY HE SAID HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE COST AND ALSO THE DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED REACTOR
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS PLANS TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES TO SOME OF THE WELFARE BENEFITS RECEIVED BY DISABLED PEOPLE WILL SAVE MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WON'T RECEIVE THE PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT SEVERAL CHARITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS

THE HOME OFFICE IS PLANNING TO SET UP A NEW FORENSIC AND BIOMETRIC SERVICE FOR YEARS AFTER IT MADE THE CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO ABOLISH ITS PREDECESSOR THE PROPOSAL IS PART OF WHAT MINISTERS SAY IS A NEW NATIONAL APPROACH TO FORENSIC SCIENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES A HAMMER FIRST CORRESPONDENTS DANNY SURE REPORTS
IN TWENTY TWELVE THE HOME OFFICE CLOSE THE FORENSIC SCIENCE SERVICE A GOVERNMENT OWN COMPANY SAYING IT WAS LOSING TWO MILLION POUNDS EACH MONTH BUT LAST YEAR THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE WARNED THAT STANDARDS OF FORENSIC SCIENCE WORK WERE IN DANGER OF SLIPPING BECAUSE POLICE WERE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON UNREGULATED EXPERTS TO EXAMINE SAMPLES FROM SUSPECTS AND CRIME SCENES
IN ITS NEW STRATEGY THE HOME OFFICE ACKNOWLEDGES FORENSIC SCIENCE PROVISION HAS BECOME FRAGMENTED IT SAYS DIGITAL ANALYSIS OF COMPUTERS AND SMARTPHONES IS BEING CONDUCTED IN AN AD HOC MANNER WHICH DOESN'T PROVIDE VALUE FOR MONEY
AS A RESULT MINISTERS SAY THEY'RE SUPPORTING A REVIEW BY POLICE OF THE CASE FOR A JOINT FORENSIC AND BIOMETRIC SERVICE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE INCREASED CAPABILITY AND RESILIENCE
THE BRITISH ROCK MUSICIAN KEITH EMERSON WHOSE GROUP WITH GREG LAKE AND CARL PALMER WAS HUGELY SUCCESSFUL IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD AT HIS HOME IN CALIFORNIA HE WAS SEVENTY ONE THE POLICE SAY HE SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE KEITH EMERSON HAD SUFFERED FROM ILL HEALTH A FEW YEARS AGO PETER BOWS IN LOS ANGELES REPORTS
A SPOKESMAN FOR SANTA MONICA POLICE SAID KEITH EMERSON DIED FROM A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD HIS BODY WAS DISCOVERED BY HIS GIRLFRIEND AT THEIR HOME

PETER BOWS REPORTING THE TIME IS JUST COMING UP TO TEN PAST EIGHT HIS OPPONENTS CALLED DONALD TRUMP A MAN WHO STIRS UP VIOLENCE HATRED DIVIDES AMERICA AT THE UNIVERSITY IN CHICAGO WHERE HE HAD BEEN DUE TO SPEAK LAST NIGHT DOZENS OF STAFF HAD PETITIONED THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS ASKING THEM TO CANCEL IT SAYING TO CREATE A HOSTILE AND PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS
WELL THEY DIDN'T CANCEL IT THE PLAN WAS FOR IT TO GO AHEAD BUT IN THE END MY TRUMP HIMSELF DECIDED TO POSTPONE BECAUSE OF FEARS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE THERE AFTER PROTESTERS AND SUPPORTERS OF TRUMP STARTED FIGHTING HERE IS WHAT THE MAN HIMSELF TOLD THE T.V. NETWORK M.S. N.B.C.
BORELLI IN MAJOR CERTAINLY IN THIS COUNTRY ANY MORE WITHOUT
SILENCE OR A POTENTIAL MILE AND SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE REAL FLOWERS
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO CALL IT A PIE JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD AND I'M EDWARD LYON BOYS WE KNOW WE COULD'VE DONE IT WE WOULD HAVE DONE IT WE COULD'VE DONE IT
BUT I DECIDED NOT TO DO IT BUT IT'S VERY TOUGH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID OH THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE IT
IT WAS MY DECISION TODAY MY DECISION IS I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE OVER ALL THIS OF COURSE COMING JUST DAYS AHEAD OF THE SET OF PRIMARY ELECTIONS THAT COULD SEE DONALD TRUMP BECOME PRETTY MUCH UNSTOPPABLE AS THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY I'VE BEEN TALKING TO TURN WITH TONY ARNOLD IS A POLITICAL REPORTER WITH W. B. E. Z. CHICAGO RADIO STATION THERE AND WHO WAS AT THE RALLY LAST NIGHT
I GET THERE A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT OF A SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AND THE SPACE WAS FILLING UP I'M IN THE LINES WERE AROUND THE BLOCK JUST TO GET IN BUT FROM THE LINES IS MOSTLY WAS LIKE THEY WERE ACTUAL TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND DEMONSTRATORS WERE AROUND BUT THEY WERE
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THEY WERE IN LINE TO GET IN WHEN I WHEN I WENT INTO THE BOMBING BUT WITHIN ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR TWO HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT WAS SUPPOSED TO START THERE WAS A SPECIFIC
CROWD THEY CAME IN AND SAID AND ONE AREA OF THE ARENA ALTOGETHER AND IT WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT THEY WERE NOT TRUMP SUPPORTERS IT WAS AROUND THAT TIME ALSO
A GROUP OF MAYBE THREE OR FOUR YOUNG MEN ARE WEARING TEACHER SHIRTS SAY MUSLIMS UNITED AGAINST CHANT
WE WERE ESCORTED OUT ESCALATED FROM THERE HOW DID THE FIGHTING BREAK OUT THERE
AS THIS GROUP THAT WAS IN ONE SPECIFIC SECTION STARTED TO ANTS
AND MAKE A SCENE THEMSELVES WHAT HAPPENED THEN WAS TRUMP REPORT TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO WERE ON THE FLOOR ALL MOVED OVER TO THE BACK OF THE ARENA NEAR WHERE THAT SECTION IS IN THERE WAS THIS
EXTENDED STARE DOWN BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES WITH THE SECURITY BETWEEN BUT YOU'RE THE CHAMP SUPPORTERS ON THE FLOOR THE DEMONSTRATORS IN THE STATE
THE TWO SIDES ONE BY ONE THE POLICE WOULDN'T WOULD SINGLE OUT ONE PARTICULAR PERSON AND ESCORT THEM OUT AND JUST KEPT HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO THE POINT WHEN EVENTUALLY THE TWO SIDES ARE STARTED TO MINGLE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND THAT'S WHEN A LITTLE BIT OF EASE PROBABLY SOME IMAGES OF PUSHING AND SHOVING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES AND THEN HOW WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT MADE THAT THE RALLY HAD BEEN ABANDONED
WELL THERE'S TWO ANNOUNCEMENTS FIRST MAYBE AN HOUR BEFORE
THEY'RE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SAID THERE IS A SPACE OUTSIDE FOR PROTESTERS IT'S A SEED SPACE TO GO PLEASE GO OUTSIDE YOU'RE HERE TO PROTEST OBVIOUSLY THERE DID NOT HAPPEN AND AND ABOUT
HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE SPEECH WAS SUPPOSED TO START THERE WAS A SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THAT FAMILY SAID MISTER TRUMP IS IN CHICAGO BUT HE WILL NOT BE COMING IT'S BEEN POSTPONED THAT'S WHEN REALLY EVERYTHING
HE WAS TAKEN TO EVEN ANOTHER LEVEL THAN IT ALREADY WAS AT I HAVEN'T QUITE HEARD A MIX OF BOOS AND CHEERS AT THE SAME TIME I DISS IN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A LOT OF REALLY RAW EMOTIONS OR ONE TRUMP SUPPORTER STEVE SWARTZ WHO ACTUALLY LIVES IN CHICAGO HE SAID THIS IS OUR PARTY THIS ISN'T THEIR PARTY THEY WERE NOT INVITED HERE THEY CRASHED IT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE
THIS WAS THIS WAS MEANT FOR US AND HE THOUGHT THAT THE DEMONSTRATORS HAD BASICALLY TAKEN OVER THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND DONALD TRUMP'S THREAD TO FREE SPEECH ON THE OTHER HAND
THE OTHER THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO DID THE INTERRUPTING IN THE DEMONSTRATORS I DO ANOTHER ONE OF VERMIN IN CHRISTINA SEEGER AND SHE SAID I DON'T HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE FOR TRUMP THE FACT IS SHE SHE I COULD WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING WHICH IS THEIR TRUMP AS A RACE
AND HE'S A LOT OF RUDE THINGS TO PEOPLE SO I DO EXPECTS DENIAL EXPECT A PROTEST IN RESPONSE TO THE TOWN THE TRUMPET SO IT WOULD BE SHE CALLED HER STUPID TONY ARNOLD FROM W.B. E.Z. CHICAGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW QUARTER PAST EIGHT THE WRITERS ON THE MARCH IN GERMANY AT LEAST THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS THE POPULIST ANTI MIGRANT PARTY CALLED ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY A.F. DE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE BIG GAINS IN REGIONAL ELECTIONS TOMORROW BOATERS WILL GO TO THE POLLS IN THREE GERMAN STATES IN WHAT'S WIDELY REGARDED AS A TEST FOR ANGELA MERKEL AND HER REFUGEE POLICY OUR BERLIN CORRESPONDENT JENNY HE'LL REPORT FROM THE STATE OF SAXONY
GET HIM BACK HE'S A TUMBLING MEDIEVAL FAIRYTALE OF A TOWN A CLUSTER OF HALF TIMBERED HOUSES AND COBBLED STREETS LEAD UP TO A HUGE HILLTOP CASTLE
STAND ON ITS RAMPARTS AND YOU CAN SEE FOR MILES ACROSS THE EASTERN STATE OF SAXONY ANHALT
POLITICALLY THIS REGION IT MIRRORS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A COALITION OF ANGLER MERKEL'S CONSERVATIVES AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS BUT THAT LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING
BECAUSE RECENT POLLS SUGGEST ONE IN FIVE VOTERS HERE NOW SUPPORTS GERMANY'S POPULIST PARTY ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND OR A F. D. ON A MONDAY NIGHT IN THE BACK REMEMBER PUB THE LOCAL CANDIDATE IS PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED
OH IT'S BEAUTIFUL
A WOMAN I GUESS SHE'S IN HER SIXTIES LISTENS INTENTLY DID LYNDON AMPLE IS INFURIATED BY ANGELA MERKEL'S OPEN DOOR REFUGEE POLICY HE BAR SURELY YOU MAFIA
WOULD YOU QUIT HE HAD NICK SCHEME SHE WAS ALWAYS BAD FOR THIS SOCIETY I'M NOT AGAINST DIVERSITY BUT THERE MUST BE LIMITS SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE WE DO THIS PARTY SPEAKS TO PEOPLE'S HEARTS THEY TAKE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS SERIOUSLY NO ONE ELSE LISTENS
A.F. DE IS ANTI EURO ANTI MIGRANT AND CONTROVERSIAL ITS LEADER RECENTLY SUGGESTED BORDER GUARDS SHOOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND MICHAEL ONCE DISMISSED THEM AS A FRINGE PARTY ANALYSTS SAY SHE'S TAKEN HER OWN CONSERVATIVES SO FAR TO THE POLITICAL CENTRE THAT A.F. DE FILLS A NATURAL VACUUM ON THE RIGHT IT'S CANDIDATE HERE
IS ANDREW POCKETBOOK F.T. HAS AN IMAGE PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT DOESN'T IT IT'S ACCUSED OF BEING FAR TOO RIGHT WING AND BEING ANTI IMMIGRANT JUST ANTI IMMIGRANT BUT RACIST TOO
AND HE'S ASKED MY DAFT YOU'VE HAD FOUR GO OFTEN IT'S CORRECT F.T. IS ACCUSED OF BEING RACIST INHUMAN AND HOMOPHOBIC ALL OF THAT IS RUBBISH
THIS IS PROPAGANDA FROM OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHO CAN'T FIGHTERS WERE FACTS WHY DO YOU THINK F.T. ARE POLLING SO WELL INSECTS NONE OUT SEX AND IT DOES END WOULDN'T JUST LENDING OSTRICH LEARNT THESE GERMANY HAVE A DIFFERENT MENTALITY STILL THE PREPAREDNESS AND COURAGE TO OPPOSE POLITICAL DECISIONS IS HIGHER THAN IN THE WEST
PEOPLE HERE ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO DISPLAY ANTI MIGRANT SENTIMENT NO ONE'S SURE WHY PERHAPS THE RESULT OF THE REGION'S HISTORY JUST THREE PER CENT OF THE ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO ARRIVED IN GERMANY LAST YEAR ARE HOUSED IN THE
EVEN SO LOCAL BAKER MARINA BARON FENWICK TELLS ME THE REFUGEE CRISIS IS THE ONLY ELECTION ISSUE
THE WARM BUTTERY SMELL OF VANILLA SEEPS FROM THE OVEN AND SHE PREPARES ANOTHER BATCH OF CHEESECAKES
WORD IN THE LANGUAGE THESE ELECTIONS WILL BE A BAROMETER FOR THE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE A WAKE UP CALL FOR POLITICIANS
OBVIOUSLY NONE OF THE RIGHT WING AS HAS A SOLUTION AND WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID AN ATMOSPHERE OF HATRED
A REPORT FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT JENNY HILL WELL I'M JOHN OF THE LAND BY DAVID MCALLISTER WHO IS A GERMAN M.E.P. SENIOR MEMBER OF ANGELA MERKEL SEAVIEW PARTY IS ALSO A FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF THE GERMAN STATE OF LOWER SAXONY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING FROM NORTH GERMANY AND ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE F.T.
WE'RE ALL INTERESTED WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW THE FREE REGIONAL ELECTIONS AND EVEN AT THE POLLS SHOW THAT THE ULTIMATELY THAT'S A DODGE MIGHT GET UP TO NINETEEN PERCENT THAT STILL MEANS EIGHTY ONE PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE I'M NOT VOTING FOR THEM WE'VE GOT TROUBLES
OF COURSE I CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH THE POLES FOR THE A.F. DE THIS PARTY IS IN MY EYES A PROTEST MOVEMENT IT'S A ONE ISSUE PARTY
AND THEY GIVE SUPPOSEDLY SIMPLE ANSWERS PUPPET DON'T PRESENT ANY REALISTIC IDEAS HOW TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS WITH IMMIGRATION IN GERMANY THEY'RE PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S FEARS AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE SEEM TO
FOLLOWING THEM THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH ISN'T IT THAT CHANCELLOR MERKEL AS IT WERE ENCOURAGED THOSE FEARS HALL GAVE VENT TO THOSE FEARS BY SUGGESTING THAT BRITAIN GERMANY SHOULD OPEN ITS DOORS TO MIGRANTS FROM ASSYRIA AND THAT SCARED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAW THEM COMING IN SUCH LARGE NUMBERS
MIGRATION CRISIS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR GERMANY AT LEAST SINCE REUNIFICATION BUT THIS CRISIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS AND IT REQUIRES AN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE AND ANGULAR MARKL AS WORKING ON ALL LEVELS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL ON A EUROPEAN LEVEL AND ON A NATIONAL LEVEL AND WE ALL AGREED THAT THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS PASSING FROM TURKEY TO GREECE
IS MUCH TOO HIGH AND NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT DOWN SIGNIFICANT WHY DID SHE SAY GERMANY'S DOORS ARE OPEN GERMANY HAS A HUMAN A TARRY AND POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE A VERY LIBERAL ASYLUM SEEKER LAW WE HAVE WE SHOWED A RESPONSIBILITY TOO
BRING PEOPLE TO GERMANY WHO ARE IN NEED OF PROTECTION BUT THE THING IS THOSE MIGRANTS WHO ARE NOT IN NEED OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION HAVE TO BE TURNED IMMEDIATELY OUR ADMINISTRATOR OF PROCEDURES ARE STILL TOO LONG WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND WE ARE CHANGING OUR SYSTEM BUT ONCE AGAIN WE CAN'T SOLVE THIS ON OUR OWN IN GERMANY WE NEEDED EUROPEAN ANSWER TO THIS AND THAT'S WHY ANGELA MERKEL IS WORKING SO HARD ON BETTER SECURING OUR EXTERNAL BORDERS
BRING ESTABLISHING A WRIST REGISTRATION CENTRES INCREASE IN ITALY AND FINDING A SYSTEM HAD TO KEEP ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT PROTECTION OF THEY CAN STAY IN EUROPE BUT OTHERS CAN'T BUT YOU WOULD ACCEPT WOULDN'T SHE WOULD THAT YOU'RE FROM EUROPE'S RESPONSE TO THIS MASSIVE CRISIS HAS BEEN
SO I WAS GOING TO SAY PATHETIC IT IT CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN IMPRESSIVE HOUSE IT THERE IS NO SOLUTION AS WE SPEAK I HOPE THEY'RE A BIT ANYBODY REALLY BELIEVES HE'S GOING TO DEAL WITH THESE GREAT CRISIS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE TWENTY OF MEMBER STATES THAT'S FOR SURE WE HAD SOME COUNTRIES WHICH WERE READY TO TAKE REFUGEES OF US LIKE HUNGRY WEREN'T READY BUT THE LAST SUMMAT WITH WITH THE TURKS AND BUSTLE TROUPE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A EUROPEAN SOLUTION
WE ONCE AGAIN YOU'VE GOT TO TRY VERY HARD TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBERS TOO HIGH AND WE ALSO HAVE TO FIGHT THE SMUGGLERS AND THOSE PEOPLE BRINGING THE REFUGEES TO EUROPE
THAT'S THE WHOLE ISSUE BUT ONCE AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT REAL POLITICS AND IT'S DIFFICULT DIFFICULT QUESTIONS BUT WHAT THE ULTIMATE KEEPER FOR DEUTSCHLAND IS DOING IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO UNMASK THEM AND EXPOSED THEM AND SHOW BUT THEY ARE A POPULIST PARTIALLY CENTRE FOR MICK AND RACIST MYSTICAL IN THE LONG RUN ISN'T IT THIS IS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING DOWN THE EUROPEAN UNION
NO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ALWAYS HAD SOME DIFFICULT TIMES AND AFTER WORDS EUROPE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGER THAN BEFORE OF COURSE THIS IS THESE ARE NOT EASY TIMES FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION WE STILL HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES
WITHIN THE TWENTY OF MEMBER STATES BUT THE LAST SUMMIT SHOWED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND MORE EUROPEAN CONSENSUS AND THAT'S WHAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AND ANGELA MERKEL
HE'S WORKING ON CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS WELL YOU SAY EACH CRISIS LEAVES THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE STRONGER THAN BEFORE I WONDER IF THAT'S TRUE THE EURO CRISIS CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO THAT THE EURO CRISIS IS STILL WITH US
THERE'S A CRISIS IN CERTAIN MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROZONE THAT'S TRUE AND THESE STATES OR HAVE TO DO BE A STRUCTURAL REFORMS A GOOD EXAMPLE IS IRELAND WHICH WAS IN TROUBLE BUT WHICH DID THE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND IS NOW ON TRACK OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE TO FOLLOW THE IRISH FOR MODEL BUT IN GENERAL THE EURO IS THE STRONG CURRENCY AND WE IN GERMANY BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE OF OUR JOINT CURRENCY BECAUSE IT WAS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD FOR US
AS REGARDS TO EUROPEAN INTEGRATION BUT WE COMPLETELY ACCEPT THAT OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED KINGDOM DON'T WANT TO DEDUCE THE EURO AND YOU MAY SOON NOT HAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE MAY NO LONGER BE A MEMBER
THAT'S A DECISION THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL TAKE AND WE WILL ACCEPT ANY DECISION WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE UP THE REFERENDUM BUT WE GERMANS WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO SEE THE BRITISH STAY AN ACTIVE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE YOU ARE A VALUABLE ALLY AND PARTNER FOR US AND YOU HAD KINGHAM HAS
BROUGHT SO MUCH TO BE EUROPEAN UNION ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THE EUROPEAN UNION MORE COMPETITIVE FIGHTING RED TAPE AND MAKING THIS WHOLE INSTITUTION WHAT EFFECTIVE BUT ONCE AGAIN IT'S UP TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO DECIDE BUT WE WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO STAY DAVID MCALLISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOREMAN'S BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SPORT TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING

WHEN JEREMY CORBIN MADE JOHN MACDONALD AND HIS SHADOW CHANCELLOR THERE WAS MUCH SUCKING A BREATH IN SOME QUARTERS THIS WAS THE MAN WHOSE ENTRY IN WHO'S WHO AS HIM TALKING TO FERMENTING THE OVERTHROW OF CAPITALISM TALK ABOUT BEING RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW BUT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT IN THE SPEECH HE MADE YESTERDAY INSTEAD IT WAS ALL ABOUT FISCAL CREDIBILITY AND NOT SPENDING BEYOND AMIN AND ISRAEL MIDDLE OF THE ROAD STUFF MISTER MCDONNELL IS REALLY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING THERE'S THIS MEAN NO MORE TAX AND SPEND IT
IT DOES REALLY WE'RE GOING TO BREAK AWAY FROM THAT OLD SHIP OF US WHAT IT'S LIKE YES WE ARE WE'RE ABOUT MANAGING THE ECONOMY EFFECTIVELY AND ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT SOCIALISM IS ALL ABOUT SO WE'LL BE LOOKING TO SEE HOW WE INVEST IN THE LONG TERM THE ECONOMY CREATE A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY BY MAKE SURE THAT'S THAT PROSPERITY SHARED BY ALL AND WINDED THIS DAMASCENE CONVERSION COME ABOUT IT'S BEEN CONSISTENTLY AND EVERYTHING I BET SO I'M GOING TO BE HANDED TO LIZ AND THE OVERTHROW CONSISTENT OUR POLICIES ARE TRANSFORMING CAPITALISM SO AS I SAY WE CREATE A PROSPEROUS SOCIETY
BUT THAT PROSPERITY SHARED BY ALL WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE MARKET THAT WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR MARKETS BUT WHAT SOCIALISM IS ALL ABOUT FROM BERNARD CRICK OR THROUGH REMEMBER NEIL KINNOCK SENT BURNER CRYPT TO DEFINE SESSION HE CAME BACK TO LOOK SO SHE'S ON ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF QUALITY TO A DEMOCRACY IN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR POLICIES WERE ADVOCATING SO TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC THEN YOU WOULD ACCEPT IN FUTURE IN ORDER TO MEET THE TARGETS TOO
REDUCE BORROWING YOU WOULD ACCEPT CUTS RATHER THAN NECESSARILY THORPE INSTINCTIVELY PERHAPS IS A BETTER WORD IMPOSING TOUCH RIGHT LOOK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THIS
I THINK THIS GOES IN THIS HAS BEEN WELCOMED THIS MORNING BY BUSINESS LEADERS BOTH ENTREZ ENTREPRENEURS AS WELL AS TRADE YES YOU'RE SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE WELL PEEP NO IT'S THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY TO THEM IS THEY AGREE WITH US WHAT WE WANT IS A FAIR TAXATION SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE PAYS THEIR WAY SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE GOOGLE TAXES AND ALL THE RESTAURANT WHERE PEOPLE CAN WALK AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SECONDLY THAT WE INVEST IN THE LONG TERM AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE GROW THE ECONOMY BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AS WELL AS THAT WE SHARE THAT PROSPERITY AS WE GROW THE ECONOMY AND I THINK THAT'S
SOUND COMMON SENSE IT'S BEEN WELCOMED RIGHT THROUGH RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE BUSINESS SECTOR AND FROM THE TRAY USE THE WEALTH CREATORS OF WELCOME AND IT'S PARTLY THOUGH DOWN TO HOW YOU DEFINE INVESTMENT ISN'T IT BECAUSE GORDON BROWN OF COURSE USED TO USE THAT PHRASE ALL THE TIME WE KNOW WE WILL NOT WE WILL BORROW NO MORE THAN WE NEED TO BUT WE WILL BORROW FOR INVESTMENT HE WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT A VESTMENT ME WELL O.K. I'VE BEEN GOOD TOURING AROUND MEETING WEALTH CREATORS AND I MEAN BOTH REPRESENT OF THE WORKERS AND ENTREPRENEURS IN THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHAT THEY'RE SO THEY'RE ON THE SAME PAGES US IN INVESTMENT IN SKILLS INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S WHERE THE FUTURE WILL LIE FOR OUR ECONOMY SO IF FOR INSTANCE AND IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE BUT IF TEACHERS SAID WE NEED A BIGGER PAY RISE AND THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE BANK TO PAY THEM
WOULD YOU SAY ALL RIGHT THAT COUNTS AS INVEST MADE OTHER WORTH ONE SUGGESTING IT WOULD BE A VERY ELASTIC I'VE GOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS GROWING THE ECONOMY AND I'M TALKING AS A SAINT TALKING TO THE WEALTH CREATORS OF CELLS AND SAY WHAT DO WE NEED TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND THEY'RE SAYING THOSE THREE THINGS INVESTMENT IN SKILLS INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT NEW TECHNOLOGY IN PARTICULAR
THAT WAY WE'LL WHAT WE WILL DO WE'LL BRING IN THE WEALTH CREATORS TO ADVISE US ON EXACTLY HOW THAT INVESTMENT WHERE IT SHOULD GO TO LEVELS OF INVESTMENT AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN WILL GET THEM TO MONITOR THAT INVESTMENT AS WELL SO IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WE'RE CREATING IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY INCLUDING EVERYONE THIS INCLUSIVE DEBATE THIS IS OUR NEW NEW POLITICS NEW POLITICS MEANING THAT THE OLD ONES YOU KNOW EXCEPT WITH THE OLD APPROACH THE OLD POLICY SIMPLY DIDN'T WORK
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO HERE YESTERDAY I WAS TALKING ABOUT RESTORING LABOUR'S CREDIBILITY ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE RESTORING MEANS THAT IT THAT'S RIGHT OLD ONE BECAUSE WELL YES QUITE RIGHT TO BE AT WE'RE LOST CREDIBILITY DON'T OFF WELL WE GOT WE WE LOST CREDIBILITY COS WE LOST TWO ELECTIONS BUT ALSO A LOT OF THAT BUT DID YOU LOSE CREDIBILITY AND THEREFORE DO TWO ELECTION BECAUSE YOUR POLICIES WERE WRONG OR WHAT WELL THERE WERE SOME MISTAKES MADE BUT TO BE FRANK
THE LAST CRISIS BRUISE BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS FOR MISSUS THATCHER ON WAS ALLOWED BANKERS TO CREATE A CASINO ECONOMY I CRITICISE MY OWN SIDE NEW LABOUR FOR ALLOWING SOME OF THAT AS WELL BUT I HAVE TO I DID FROM THE BACKBENCHES BUT I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I CRITICISE MY OWN SIDE
THE CONSERVATORS WANTED TO DEREGULATE THE BANKS EVEN FURTHER WE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN A WORSE MESS HOWEVER I'M NOT JUST TALK ABOUT RESTORED CREDIBILITY OF THE LABOUR PARTY I'VE GOT THIS AMBITION I WANNA RESTORE CREDIBILITY IN ECONOMIC DISCUSSION IN THIS POLITICAL ECONOMIC DISCUSSION IN THIS COUNTRY OVERALL COS I THINK
AT THE MOMENT PEOPLE JUST DO NOT TRUST NOT JUST THE EXISTING CHANCELLOR BUT THEY DO NOT TRUST THOSE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF OUR ECONOMY IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL DECISION HAVE BEEN MADE AND TRIED TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF DEBATE SO PEOPLE CAN RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN POLITICIANS MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THIS SO THEREFORE YOU WOULD BE PREPARED TO MAKE CUTS TO PUBLIC SPENDING IF YOU FELT IT WAS NECESSARY YOU WOULD YOU WOULD
I'M TEMPTED TO CALL YOU AN AUSTRALIAN BUT PERHAPS LET'S NOT GO THAT FAR WELL I HAVE AS WE DO NOBODY SEE THAT DOESN'T SQUARE DOES IT YOU CAN'T BE ANTI AUSTERITY IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T SAY WE WILL NOT CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BUT WE WILL BE ENTIRELY RESPONSE LET ME MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I WILL BE ABSOLUTELY RUTHLESS ABOUT HOW WE MANAGE OUR ARE SPENDING EVERY SPENT EVERY PENNY SPENT OUT THE ACCOUNT NO IT'S NOT ABOUT CUTTING IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE YOU SPEND THE MONEY WISELY BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT'S FAIR AND YOU GROW THE ECONOMY
AUSTERITY IS NOT AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY IT'S A POLITICAL CHOICE WE'VE SEEN THAT'S HONEST ISN'T IT OF COURSE IT DOES AND WHILE I DO THE POD I'M PUTTING WE'RE NOT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ACCEPT AUSTERITY NO OF COURSE WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING AUSTERITY WHAT WAS SAID JUST SAID OH YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS WE WILL GROW THE ECONOMY WILL ENSURE A FAIR TAXATION SYSTEM AND WILL ENSURE THEREFORE AS A RESULT OF THAT WE SHARE IN THE PROSPER RIGHT FAIRLY THAT DOES NOT THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE
THE SORT OF CUTS THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS MORNING WHERE THE CHANCELLOR NOW IS CUTTING THE BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES WITH THE PROSPECT OF MAYBE GIVEN TAX CUTS THE WEALTHY THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE AND IF THE ECONOMY DOESN'T GROW QUITE THE WAY YOU WOULD HOPE IT WILL AND OF COURSE THAT HAPPENS DOESN'T IT CHANCELLORS DON'T ALWAYS JUST SAY THIS WILL GROW AND THEREFORE BUBBLEGUM THINGS GO WRONG THINGS GO WRONG ALL THE TRUCK THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE OF THE BUSINESS ISN'T IT IF THE ECONOMY DOES NOT GROW THE WAY YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE
THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WE WILL PUT UP INSTINCTIVELY DO YOU PUT UP ACTORS OR INSTINCTIVELY YOU GO FOR CUT WOULD ARGUE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PLAN YOUR CONNIE THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY I'M TRYING TO RESTORE CREDIBILITY AND ECONOMIC WAY OVER WEE PROBLEM IT COLLAPSES THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK NO THAT'S TRUE AND YOU HAVE TO ADJUST THEM BUT YOU BALANCE THE BOOKS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT YOUR INCOME IS MATCHING YOUR EXPENDITURE BUT THE WAIT WE DO THAT WE FELL SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST IS THAT YOU WE HAVEN'T INVESTED AFFECT IF WE INVEST IN THE FUTURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY
OTHER GOVERNMENTS HAVE INVESTED THEIR LABOUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE INVESTED THE ECONOMY DOESN'T GO THE WAY YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THAT IS OBVIOUS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET I DON'T THINK WE'VE QUITE GOT THERE IS GIVEN THE OPTION
IS YOUR NOR INCLINATION TO PUT UP TAXES OR TO CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING MY INCLINATION IS TO GROW THE ECONOMY OF COURSE THAT WILL BALANCE OUR BOOKS AND MAKE SURE WE DO THAT IN A FAIR WAY NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAILURES IN THE PAST IT'S AS A RESULT OF WE FAILED TO INVEST IN THE LONG TERM AND WE FAILED NUMBER FAIR TAXATION SYSTEM WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE SUCH LARGE SCALE TAX EVASION TAX AVOIDANCE THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND IN THAT WAY
IN THAT WAY WE WE WILL HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT'S FAIR CAN I GIVE YOU A QUOTE FROM AN ADMITTEDLY UNNAMED LABOUR M.P. IN THE NEW STATESMAN JOHN MACDONALD SPEECHES TONALLY A TRIBUTE TO ED BALLS JOHN IS EITHER NO THE ULTIMATE RED TORY OR HE JEREMY AND THEIR FOLLOWERS LEYDEN SHOULD APOLOGISE FOR ACCUSING THE MAINSTREAM OF THE PARTY FOR BEING SO BECAUSE THIS IS AN ADMISSION THAT THE REST OF US WERE AND ARE NOT
OSBORNE AUSTRALIAN OR WHAT AYE WHEN I WOKE UP TO THIS MORNING WAS THE WELCOME OF THE SUPPORT OF THE ALL THE MAJOR ALL THE MAJOR REPRESENT HER BODY'S A BUSINESS
AND AT THE SAME TIME THE INDEPENDENT THE MORNING STAR RIGHT THE WAY ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM OF ACTUALLY ENDORSED MY MY STRATEGY FROM YES IN TERMS OF THAT WHAT YOU ARE NOW NO IT YOU'VE THE POLICIES ON WHICH DEMONSTRATES IF YOU'RE GOT THE SUPPORT OF THAT BROAD SPECTRUM FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT FROM THERE
COMMUNIST PARTY MORNING STAR RIGHT ACROSS TO THE C.B.I. YOU MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOW MAINSTREAM WITH COMMON SENSE POLICIES I'M RESTORING THE CREDIBILITY NOT JUST OF THE LABOUR PARTY BUT I THINK OF ECONOMIC DEBATE IMPULSE RIGHT THIS GOT JEREMY CORBIN
LABOUR PARTY AS MAINSTREAM WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT IT'S NOT WHAT WE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS OWEN NO NOT AT ALL IT'S SOCIALISM AS ALWAYS ALL RIGHT COMMON SENSE AND RATIONALITY THAT IS WHY THE LABOUR PARTY WON SUCCESSIVE ELECTIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE WIN THEM AGAIN WHY MENTION JEREMY CORBIN HE'S ASKED ONE HUNDRED QUESTION SOMEBODY'S DONE A BIT OF NUMBER CRUNCHING IS ASKED ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS ONE THING HE HAS NOT ASKED ABOUT THEM HAS COLLARED OF DAVID CAMERON IS IMMIGRATION WHY NOT
PEOPLE WORRY A LOT ABOUT IT WELL HE'S BEEN CHOOSING THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PUT IN THE VARIOUS CORRESPONDENCE THAT HE'S RECEIVED I DID I DON'T BELIEVE THAT NOBODY'S EVER NEED DERMOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION HE'S BEEN THERE SIX MONTHS THAT WILL BE AT THE SHOW I'M SURE THAT'LL BE AN ISSUE THAT WILL BE AN ISSUE THAT WILL COME UP IN DUE COURSE OF COURSE THERE WILL BUT WHAT HE'S TRIED TO DO ALL RIGHT
THIS IS WHERE I ADMIRE HIM FOR WHAT HE TRYING TO GET A RATIONAL DISCUSSION AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS ON WHERE HE ANSWER ASKED THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE PUT TO HIM AS WELL AS THE TOPICAL ISSUES AND THEN TRY TO GET A RATIONAL RESPONSE FROM DAVID CAMERON DAVID COMES TO THE POLITICAL KNOCKABOUT JUST STAY WITH HIM FOR ONE SECOND FINAL QUESTION THE ARCHBISHOP GOING TO BE AS YOU KNOW YESTERDAY'S SAID BRITONS HAVE A GENUINE AND JUSTIFIED FEAR OF MASS IMMIGRATION AND IT'S NOT RACIST TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE
IS HE RIGHT IT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S NOT RACIST TO HAVE A DEBATE AROUND I KNOW BUT HE SAID THE FEAR OF MIGRATION PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE PEOPLE WRITE A LOT OF FEAR IMMIGRATION PEOPLE HAVE FEARS OF CHANGE OVERALL AND IMMIGRATION IS ONE OF THOSE MATTERS THAT THEY THEY FEEL CONCERNED ABOUT CHANGE WHEN THEY SEE CHANGE WITHIN A SOCIETY AND ONE OF THE JOBS ARE POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IS TO ALLOW THAT DEBATE TO TAKE PLACE IN SHAPE THAT DEBATE SO YOU CAN REASSURE PEOPLE
I LIVE IN A MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOUR IS AFRO CARIBBEAN ACROSS THE ROAD IS A PUNJABI SIKH AND THEN A PAKISTANI MUSLIM AND THEN A SOUTH AFRICAN THEN A WHITE BRITISH PERSON YOU'RE VERY CLASSY CLASH OPIATE SALARY YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT IT'S I LOOKED IN THE MOST DEPRIVED WARD IN MY CONSTITUENCY AND IN MY BOROUGH IT'S A WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY AND I'M PROUD OF IT
BUT WE RUBBED TOGETHER VERY VERY LOT WELL WHY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD AN OPEN DEBATE ABOUT HOW OUR SOCIETY IS CHANGING WE'VE UNDERSTAND WHAT ISSUES COME UP FROM THAT WE'VE TACKLED THEM AND THAT'S THE WAY WE GO FORWARD JOHN MCDONNELL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE SUN ACCUSES PRESIDENT OBAMA OF RANK HYPOCRISY FOR ACCUSING DAVID CAMERON OF BEING A FREE RIDER AND GETTING DISTRACTED AFTER THEIR TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN MILITARY ATTACK ON LIBYA UNDER BARACK OBAMA THE U.S. IS ABANDONED TO ITS ROLE AS THE WORLD POLICEMAN PAPER SAYS IT'S ENABLED MURDEROUS I ASKED TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD IN THE MIDDLE EAST FROM WISH TO TERRORISE THE WEST A CARTOON IN THE TIME SHOWS MISTER OBAMA POINTING AT THE MESS LEFT BY A COWERING POODLE AND TELLING HIM YOU CLEAN IT UP
ANOTHER IN THE DAILY MIRROR HAS STAYED CAMERA ASKING MY OBAMA THERE STILL THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP ISN'T THERE MISTER PRESIDENT IN THE U.S. THE SUREST DAVE THE FORMER LABOUR HEALTH SECRETARY ALAN MILBURN THE GOVERNMENT SOCIAL MOBILITY TSAR WARNS IN THE GUARDIAN THAT BRITAIN RISKS BECOMING PERMANENTLY DIVIDED BECAUSE OF WHAT HE TERMS INTER GENERATIONAL INEQUALITY HE BELIEVES A MIX OF PRESSURES FACING TWENTY SOMETHINGS COULD AMOUNT TO AN EX ESSENTIAL CRISIS AND A WIND OF CHANGE NEEDS TO SWEEP THROUGH THE COUNTRY
PAPER SAYS HIS COMMENTS WERE AMPLIFIED BY THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AT MARIO DRAGGY WHO SAID EUROPE'S ECONOMIES WERE RIGGED TO PROTECT OLDER WORKERS AT THE EXPENSE OF NEW EMPLOYEES THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE YOUNG ARE BEING WRITTEN OUT OF THE POLITICAL SCRIPT THEY MUST DO SOMETHING THEY HADN'T BEEN VERY GOOD AT VOTE
DAILY MAIL OUT REPORTS REMARKS MADE BY THE POLICE COMMISSIONER IN SURREY ABOUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE KNOW NOTHING PARTY POLITICIANS AND SOFT JUSTICE KEVIN HURLEY SPOKE OUT AFTER HEARING A MAN WHO STABBED HER NEIGHBOUR I WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER A SHORT SENTENCE HOW'D HE WROTE ON FACEBOOK THIS CRIMINAL HAS DESTROYED THE CONFIDENCE OF A FAMILY I WANTED TO GO AND SEE THE STABBER AND BATTER HIM I WANTED TO BREAK HIS LEGS
TELLS A PAPERY STANDS BY WHAT HE WROTE ME HE'D NEVER ACT ON HIS FEET AT THE TIMES WAS THAT BRITAIN WAS SUFFERING FROM IT OR SEXTING CRISIS AN INVESTIGATION BY THE TIMES AS FOUND THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SHARING SEXUAL IMAGERY ONLINE IN THE PAST THREE YEARS TIME SAYS SETTING IN SCHOOLS IT'S OUT OF CONTROL SEX EDUCATION MUST BE DRAGGED INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
AND FINALLY THE DAILY EXPRESS AMONG PAPERS TO REPORT ON MODERN FRUSTRATIONS BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN AT THE DINNER TABLE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AGAIN IS THE PROBLEM RESEARCHERS IN THE U.S. SAY THEY FOUND GROWING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE ASKING THEIR PARENTS TO PUT THEIR PHONES DOWN WHEN THE FAMILY SEAT
CHANCE THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE KEITH EMERSON OF THE PROG ROCK BAND EMERSON LAKE AND PALMER HAS DIED HE WAS SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD KEYBOARD PLAYER WAS FOUND WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD AT HIS HOME IN CALIFORNIA AND PLEASE SAY THAT THEY'RE TREATING HIS DEATH AS SUICIDE EMERSON WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOP KEYBOARD PLAYERS OF THE PROG ROCK ERA HAD A NUMBER OF NOTABLE RECORDS INCLUDING VERSION OF
FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN AND HIS BAND'S BIGGEST HIT LUCKY
IS IT WITH ME IS AN INSTINCTIVE THING
I CAN AND HAVE DISCIPLINED BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO PUT ON AND EMOTIONS SUCH AS AGGRESSION
AND THE MUSIC IS NOT ENOUGH TO EXPRESS IT I LET MYSELF
WE CAN TALK TO STEVE HACKETT'S WHO'S THE FORMERLY GUITARIST WITH GENESIS AND KNEW KEITH EMERSON PERSONALLY MORNING STEVE WHAT KIND OF A GUY WAS HE
HE COULD PLAY ROCKY COULD ALSO PLAY PARKS
WHAT'S MY WIFE DOING A FILM SCORE AND A JAM TOGETHER WITH JACK CHRISTIANS AND OTHER GUYS
ANNA REALLY SKILFUL PLAYER TWO WHICH I SUPPOSE IN A WAY I'M IN THERE AND NOT LOTS BIGGER ACHIEVED A LOT OF FAME AT THE TIME AND IN THE SEVENTIES BUT HE WASN'T A GENUINE MUSICIAN
BUT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT GREAT HAIRSTYLES AWKWARD DON'T WONDERFULLY
BUT FROM IT IT WAS THE REAL THING THE GENUINE ARTICLE AND WHEN HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND DURING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE THAT NEW UNION WAS HERE WAS HE A HAPPY PERSON WAS HE A PERSON HE WAS GETTING ALL OUT OF HIS LIFE HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
AT THIS POINT
THAT WE HAVE
BUT WHEN EDWARD AT THE HIGH SPOT OF HIS LIFE HE HE WAS HAVING FUN
AND QUITE A DISCIPLINE MAZ READING SOMEWHERE THAT HE USED TO RUN TEN MILES A DAY OF HER BRAIN WHICH IS QUITE SOMETHING
FAVOURITE THAT WAS SOMETHING SUMMER WHAT HE LEAVES US COS THERE'S THIS AND GREAT WORK THERE WE HAD JUST HAD A VERY BRIEF EXCEPT THERE IS A LOT ISN'T IT IT IS MY ALLSORTS OF THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A ROCK'N'ROLLER BUT I DO REMEMBER
AND YOU KNOW HE WAS VERY GOOD YOU KNOW YOU COULD PLAY THE ORGAN ARE PISS
A ROUGH OLD TIME FOR ROCK MUSIC ISN'T IT ISN'T IT IS IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE WEEK
STEVE HACKETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NO TEN TO NINE WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THE ENERGY COMPANY E.D.F. HAS ASKED THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WHICH OWNS IT FOR MORE MONEY BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS TO BE THE LEAST PUBLICLY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THE NEW NUCLEAR REACTOR
AT HINKLEY POINT IN SOMERSET ARE OTHERS ARE LESS CONVINCED THAT THAT IS THE CASE IN A LEADING BRITISH INDUSTRIALISTS TO TELL THE TIMES AND HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE DEAL HERE IN THE U.K. JIM RATCLIFF THE FOUNDER OF CHEMICALS COMPANY ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST ELECTRICITY USERS SAYS THE DEAL IS OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE WE CAN TALK TO SIMON TAYLOR AN ECONOMIST AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY'S JUDGE BUSINESS SCHOOL HE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WELL I THINK THE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF E.D.F. IS LOOKING FOR EXTRA FINANCIAL SUPPORT SHOWS THAT HE WOULDN'T GO AHEAD ORDINARILY THIS WOULD BE AN INDEFENSIBLE DECISION FOR ANY NORMAL COMPANY AND HE'S HE'S TRYING TO GET REASSURANCE FROM HIS MAJOR SHAREHOLDER THAT IF IT DOES GO WRONG THAT HE HE CAN'T BE SUED BY HIS OTHER SHAREHOLDERS DO YOU THINK HE'LL GET THAT REASSURANCE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY I THINK POLITICALLY BE VERY EMBARRASSING FOR THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO CANCEL THIS AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP ALIVE THE COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS OF THE FRENCH REACTOR WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT AT HINCKLEY BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT REACTORS GOT NO FUTURE ANYWAY THIS WOULD BE THE FIFTH TO BE BUILT AND ALL OF THE OTHER FOUR HAVE BEEN BEHIND SCHEDULE OVER BUDGET MASSIVELY OVER BUDGET IN SOME CASES AND IT'S PROBABLY A LOST CAUSE SO FOR THEM TO PUT THE FRENCH TAXPAYER ON THE HOOK
FOR A PROJECT TO SUPPLY VERY EXPENSIVE ELECTRICITY TO THE U.K. IT DOESN'T LOOK ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE ALL POLITICALLY A GIANT OR BAD POLITICALLY FOR THEM WHAT ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT I MEAN COULD WE JUST PULL OUT OF THE THING AT THIS STAGE AND SAY TIMES HAVE CHANGED WE HAD ANOTHER LOOK AT IT AND THE GOVERNMENT SAY THEY'RE WELL WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
WELL THERE ISN'T AN ACTUAL BINDING CONTRACT TO SO IN THEORY YES THAT THE REASONS WHY THAT'S THERE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIRSTLY IT WOULD REALLY CAST DOUBT ON THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S ENTIRE ENERGY POLICY AND IT MIGHT JEOPARDISE THE OTHER NUCLEAR PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE WHICH LOOK TO BE CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL THEY COME ALONG WHY WOULD HE JEOPARDISE THAT WELL THEY MIGHT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISES AND WHERE DOING BUSINESS ARE TO BE RELIED ON
THE THE THESE ARE HUGE MULTI MULTI BILLION PROJECTS IN THE REQUIRED NOT JUST CONTRACTUAL CERTAINTY BUT CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT WON'T CHANGE THE RULES YOU'VE WRITTEN A BOOK A MIRACLE THE FALL AND RISE OF NUCLEAR POWER BRITAIN DOES THIS DID DOES THIS MEAN THE BOOK NEEDS TO BE RE TITLED FALL AGAIN WELL THERE AT THE RISE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE RISES INTENDED THE GOVERNMENT DEFINITELY WANTS
AND NEEDS TO BUILD NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS OR GET THEM BUILT TO MEET THE CALM THE CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS FROM THE FROM THE TWO THOUSAND CLIMATE CHANGE ACT BUT WHETHER IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS INDEED TO BE SEEN WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BEST OPTION IS IF YOU WERE ADVISING THE GOVERNMENT NOW WHAT'S THE BEST OPTION
I THINK HER DEVISE AND TO TRY AND GET THE FRENCH TO CANCEL THE PROJECT BECAUSE THAT WOULD LEAVE THE U.K. WRITER THAT'S A FIG LEAF IN A WAY WE CAN SAIL WE DIDN'T CANCEL IT THEY DO BUT WE WANT TO CANCEL DO YOU THINK IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT ALSO FACES ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT THIS WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE A GAP IN THE CARBON BUDGET FOR THE YEARS TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN
BECAUSE THE CARBON BUDGETS ARE LEGALLY BINDING IN PRINCIPLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY CURRENTLY AMBER RUDD WOULD BE IN BREACH OF THE LAW IF THOSE CARBON EMISSION TARGETS ARE NOT HIT BUT I THINK THAT COULD BE GOT ROUND IF NECESSARY SIMON TAYLOR FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY'S JUDGE BUSINESS SCHOOL THANKS
SIX MINUTES TO NINE WELL IT'S ALL OVER FOR THE HUMAN RACE AND COMPUTERS ARE SMARTER THAN US I CAN SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN BEATEN BY THEM AT THE WORLD'S MOST DIFFICULT BOARD GAME CALLED GO WHO YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT THE WORLD GO CHAMPION LISI DOLL HAS BEEN PITTED AGAINST A COMPUTER CALLED ALPHA GO OVER FIVE MATCHES ALFA WON THE FIRST TWO AND IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES HAS WON THE THIRD SO THAT'S IT HERE'S I WOULD END
THIS WAY HE WAS GOING TO BE ALIVE THIS BLACK AND A BIT OF TROUBLE EVEN A BLACK MAUVE HERE WELL DONE WOW
FOLKS YOU SAW A HISTORY MADE HERE TODAY HALF OF ALL AS ONE AGAIN THREE WINS THREE STRAIGHT WINS HAS WON THE MATCH
WELL WHAT DO WE DO NOW RORY CATTLE AND JONES'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE SO AS SHANNON IS PROFESSOR IN COGNITIVE ROBOTICS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON RORY I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WERE THERE WERE YOU BUT A BIT DRAMATIC EXPECTED I SUPPOSE EXTRAORDINARY THE LAST TWO OR THREE MORNINGS I'VE BEEN WATCHING JOHN ON YOUTUBE AS THIS IS UNFOLDED LISTENING TO TWO COMMENTATORS ON GO SPEAKING IN MY TERMS COMPLETE GIBBERISH IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ISN'T IT
BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS HIS EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE GAME OF GO IS SO COMPLEX THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPUTER TO BEAT IT BY SHEER PROCESSING POWER SHEER BRUTE FORCE JUST A QUICK ONE THAT THERE ARE VERY THEY SAY THEY KNOW GOD WAS BUT THEY SAY THERE ARE MORE MOVES THAN THERE ARE ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE YOU'VE DONE RUBBISH TO ME BUT THAT'S IT THAT'S IT MANY TIMES MORE COMPLEX THAN CHESS FOR EXAMPLE SO HE COULDN'T USE THAT METHOD IT HAD TO BASICALLY
PLAY ITSELF MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF TIMES AND LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES AND TAKE THAT KIND OF INTUITION BUT THE BEST GO PLAYERS TAKE INTO THE GAME OH RIGHT SO THEREFORE PROFESSOR SHANAHAN THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THE WORLD TOO
MAYBE THAT'S A SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED REACTION YOU KNOW YEAH I THINK IT'S A GREAT EXAGGERATION BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS A TRULY STUNNING ACHIEVEMENT AND WHAT GOOGLE DEEP MIND HAVE ACHIEVED IS IS REALLY AMAZING
IT'S INTERESTING TO COMPARE IT WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN GARY CASPER OFF CHESS CHAMPION AT THE TIME WAS BEATEN BY A COMPUTER THERE AND AN I.B.M. COMPUTER DEEP BLUE AND THAT WAS A TERRIFIC ACHIEVEMENT BUT BUT GO IS A VERY MUCH MORE COMPLEX GAME MATHEMATICALLY SPEAKING AND YOU WERE RIGHT TO SAY THERE ARE MORE BOARD CONFIGURATIONS GO THAN THERE ARE ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE KNOW HOW MANY
THE ATOMS THERE ARE IN THE UNIT I CAN'T COUNT THEM I GUESS THE ASTRONOMERS COSMOLOGISTS HAVE WAYS OF WORKING THAT OUT BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK OUT MATHEMATICALLY HOW MANY BALL CONFIGURATIONS ARE INTO IT'S A VERY VERY BIG NUMBER AND IT'S VERY VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES IN CHESS AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN'T TO USE SIMPLE BRUTE FORCE GRINDING THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE OR A LARGE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE MOVES WHICH IS THE THE ADVANTAGE THAT COMPUTERS HAVE THEY CAN JUST WORK THROUGH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES
YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THAT WITH GO YOU REALLY NEED A MUCH MORE INTUITIVE KIND OF MORE HUMANLIKE PATTERN RECOGNITION TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THIS KIND OF LEVEL AND ROY JUST COOK ON THIS ARE THEY OUT THERE NOW ALL OF THIS IS THE COMPUTER COMPANIES AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS ALREADY ARE THEY ALL SAYING RIGHT NOW WE'VE DONE THIS WE CAN DO THE NEXT BIG THING AND IF SO WHAT IS IT WELL
DENNIS WHO WHO RUNS DEEP MIND THE LONDON BASED COMPANY BEHIND THIS SAYS WE CAN TAKE THIS THIS IS THE GAMES ARE A GOOD WAY OF LEARNING WE NOW GOING TO APPLY THIS TO THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE BUT I THINK I THINK MARRIAGE WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS YES THIS IS BRILLIANT BUT THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM BEING A HUMAN LISA DEL THE PLAYER
THAT'S BEEN BEATEN HE CAN HE CAN LEAVE THE BOARD HE CAN GO HOME YOU CAN TALK TO HIS KIDS YOU CAN TRY BUT THE COMPUTER CAN'T DO THAT YET WELL AND THAT'S IT ISN'T IT WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE BECAUSE THAT WIDTH THEY CAN STILL ONLY DO THE COMPUTERS THAT IS WHAT WE TELL THEM TO DO
WELL THAT'S SORT OF RIGHT BUT BUT THE AMAZING THING IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO PROGRAMMED THIS STATE THEY DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE VERY GOOD GO PLAYERS THEY CERTAINLY NEEDED TO KNOW THE RULES BUT YOU CAN PROGRAM ALPHA GO WAS PROGRAMMED TO LEARN AND TO IMPROVE BY PLAYING AGAINST DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF ITSELF
SO IT'S COME UP WITH SURPRISING MOVES AND MOVES THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS HIGHLY CREATIVE YOU CAN BUY THESE ABSOLUTELY TOP GO PLAYER THEY STILL CAN'T ANSWER VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE SO SO WE CAN CERTAINLY WELL THEY CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS TO AN EXTENT BUT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF COMMON SENSE THAT HUMANS HAVE AND WE ARE CERTAINLY A VERY LONG WAY FROM ACHIEVING HUMAN LEVEL ARTIFICIAL THEY HAVE INTUITION
WELL IT DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE INTUITION AND CERTAINLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CALLED INTUITION IN THE CONTEXT OF GO IT'S BEEN POSSIBLE TO REPLICATE THOUGH THAT KIND OF THING IN ALPHA GO RIGHT SO WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP
SO I THINK THE NEXT STEP FOR THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'VE USED IS THAT UNLIKE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS USED IN I.B.M.'S CHESTS COMPUTER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IT DOES HAVE THIS TECHNOLOGY DOES HAVE QUITE GENERAL APPLICATION IN THE KIND OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES THAT THEY'VE USED CAN BE APPLIED TO ALL KINDS OF THERE OF OTHER THINGS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WANTED TO ENABLE OUR
SMART PHONES WITH CAMERAS TO LEARN ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE FIND IN OUR HOUSE IN OUR KITCHEN WE CAN WE CAN SORT OF RECOGNISED THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY OBJECTS I WAS AFRAID YOU'D GO THERE I ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU DICKIE BURRIDGE SHANAHAN AND ONLY COVER GOES ANDY BRYSON DAVOR MULLEN EDITORS FROM JOHN AND ME FOR THIS MORNING GOODBYE
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK THE FRENCH ENERGY COMPANY E.D.F. HAS SAID IT IS CONFIDENT THAT THE NEW HINKLEY POINT NUCLEAR PLANT IN SOMERSET WILL GO AHEAD ONCE IT HAS NEGOTIATED FOR THE SUPPORT FROM THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BUT E.D.F.
