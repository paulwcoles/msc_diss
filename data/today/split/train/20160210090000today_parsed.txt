VIRGINIA DOCTOR STRIKE I'M HERE IN THE HOSPITAL CAR PARK IN ROMFORD IT'S GLAMOROUS LIFE IS NOT FRONT PAGE OF ANY NEWSPAPER WHICH IN ITSELF IS QUITE STRIKING BUT THERE'S PLENTY ON THE INSIDE PAGES ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY AND ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES THREE THOUSAND HIT BY STRIKE OPS AXE IS HOW THE SUN PUTS IT ARE COMMENTING ON THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS THAT HAVE HAD TO BE CUT AS A RESULT OF THAT HAPPENING THE INDEPENDENT THAT HAS DONE A LOT OF GOOD REPORTING ON THE JUNIOR DOCTOR STRIKE
HAS THIS STRIKING FIGURE NINETY PER CENT OF JUNIOR DOCTORS WOULD RESIGN OVER THE NEW CONTRACT THAT IS A SURVEY THAT'S BEEN DONE HAVE A POLL OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND MEDICS NOW OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS THREATENED THAT IT WOULD IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT IF NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE NOT TO GO ANYWHERE TO BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS THIS IS THE SECOND STRIKE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A REAL POSSIBILITY
THE PAPERS SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT MIGHT RESULT AND ONE OF THE STRIKING STATISTIC IN THE PAPER SARAH AS WELL IN THE GUARDIAN

THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX INTEREST UNDER TWO HOURS' TIME JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND WILL BEGIN THAT SECOND STRIKE AND AS I SAID I'M HERE AT QUEEN'S HOSPITAL IN ROMFORD AND ALONGSIDE ME IS C. MIKA TEXTURE A CORRESPONDENT SEEMA WHO SPENT THE DAY TALKING TO STAFF HERE IN PART SEEMA ABOUT HOW ON EARTH A BIG HOSPITAL LIKE THIS COPES WHEN JUNIOR DOCTORS

WE WON BECAUSE WE'RE HARD AS THE ENERGY AND THE EXCITEMENT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL NEED TO SUCCEED IN THAT
WAIT FOR THE SAME OLD SAME OLD ESTABLISHMENT POLITICS AND ESTABLISH READ ECONOMICS THE PEOPLE WHY RIO
FOR HER PART HILLARY CLINTON ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD WORK TO DO I KNOW I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO PARTICULARLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BUT I WILL REPEAT AGAIN
SUPPORTING THE NOW I SUPPORT
BUT I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STUMBLE AND FALL WE WILL BE HEARING FROM BERNIE SANDERS BROTHER IN JUST OVER AN HOUR'S TIME
IT'S NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND FEARS ARE GROWING ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE GLOBAL BANKING INDUSTRY AGAIN SIMON JACK HE'S HERE SIMON THANKS SHARES IN SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANKS HAVE COLLAPSED IN RECENT WEEKS SUMMER DOWN FORTY PERCENT OR MORE ONE OF THE WORST HIT IS GERMANY'S BIGGEST BANK DEUTSCHE BANK THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOHN CRY AND WAS MOVED TO SEND A LETTER TO ITS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STAFF MEMBER CYST THEY REASSURING THEM
THE GERMANS BANKS' BALANCE SHEET WAS ROCK SOLID AS HE PUT IT BUT MARKETS JUST EIGHT DEGREES OR WHO'S RIGHT WE HEAD FOR ANOTHER CRISIS PETER HOME IS SENIOR FELLOW HIM BANKING AT CASPER'S SCHOOL MORNING PETER NOW DEUTSCHE BANK IS TRADING AT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE VALUE ON PAPER IT'S WORTH WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
PEOPLE DON'T SEE GROWTH THEY DON'T SEE RETURN ON THE ASSETS I WOULDN'T ARGUE TOO MUCH WITH HIS ASSET COMMENT AS MUCH AS IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BANKING SECTOR RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE ACCEPTED THAT IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THAT PROFITABLE
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT SOME OF THESE BONDS THERE WHEN YOU LEND TO BANKS THEY'RE SORT OF BAIL IN SO IF THE BANK GETS INTO TROUBLE IN THE OLD DAYS YOU KNEW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO BAIL YOU OUT YOU COULD ARGUE THAT MIGHT STILL HAPPEN BUT NOW THESE INVESTORS WILL BE FORCED TO TURN THEIR DEBTS INTO SHARES A LOT INVESTOR SAYING I DON'T ACTUALLY FANCY DOING THAT YES WELL MY CUFF YOU BIG POINTS COULD I THINK QUICKLY
WE ALWAYS KNOW THAT BAGS WE'RE GOING TO GET BAILED OUT AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE DID SEE U.S. TIME THAT CHANGED INVESTORS PERCEPTIONS OF THE RISKS SO BASE WERE ABLE TO SELL AND RECENTLY HAVE SOLD TWO TYPES OF BARNES
ONE TYPE WHICH WE WOULD RECOGNISE AS THE NORMAL KIND OF BAR AND THAT WOULD NORMALLY CALLED SENIOR NOTES IN THE CASE OF BAGS BUT THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE CALLED CONTINGENT CONVERTIBLE BANDS WHICH ARE REALLY EQUITY DRESSED UP AS BARNES AND I WOULD SAY THEY'VE BEEN TOTALLY MISSED PRAISED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND REGULATORS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR THAT AND PERCEIVE THAT INVESTORS WERE REALLY TAKING EQUITY RISK AND PRICING IT LIKE
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IS ARE WE ON THE CUSP OF ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TYPE EVENT WELL WE'LL SEE I THINK WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR PRICING CHANGES THAT WE SEE WHO IS THE NEXT TARGET BANK WHO SECURITY SING IN A PUB DOWN BUT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE ABOUT
MISSED PRICING OF RISK AND THIS PRICING HER BANKS THAT IT IS ABOUT WEAKNESSES OF COIRE ASSET QUALITY IN BAGS OH KAY THAT'S THE BANKING VIEW WHAT'S THE INVESTOR VIEW OUR AD RICHARDS IS THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS BUT THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT MARKETS ARE NEVER COMFORTED WHEN POLITICIANS AND BANK MANAGEMENT RUSH OUT TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING'S ABSOLUTELY FINE GLITTER BUT THE BOARD BACKING A FOOTBALL MANAGER CORRECT IAN YOU KNOW THAT THE NEXT WEEK IS GOING TO BE UP THERE WITH HIS THE RESIGNATION LETTER
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF THAT AND I THINK I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO TEASE OUT OF IT THOUGH THE FIRST IS THAT POST CRISIS THAT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK PUT IN TO RE CAPITALISING THE BANKING SECTOR IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND WE HAD ALL THIS IT WAS A STRESS TESTS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ABOUT OF LIQUIDITY THAT IS IN THE SECTOR AS A WHOLE WHICH IS GOOD BALLAST BUT ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A LOT OF THE REGULATORY CHANGE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS
IT'S MADE THE PLUMBING THAT SITS UNDERNEATH ALL OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM ITS EFFECT WE SQUEEZE THE PIPES THE PIPES ARE NARROWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE AND IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AT HOME WHEN YOU'VE GOT A NARROW A PIPE IT'S MUCH MORE LIABLE TO JUST ACCEPT THAT AND BECAUSE I'M QUITE GETTING THAT IN TERMS OF THE PLUMBING THIS IS BANKS LEND TO EACH OTHER WHEN INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS ARE FUNDS PUT UP COLLATERAL
I HAD IT WHEN YOU GO IN AND YOU BUY AIR PROTECTION AGAINST DE FAULTLESS YES MARKET FOR EXAMPLE IS LESS THAT BANKS HAVE LESS ABILITY TO ACT AS INTERMEDIARIES AND SMOOTH THE FLOW BETWEEN THE BUYER AND A SELLER AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT IT JUST TAKES A TINY LITTLE DISLOCATION OR SOME LACK OF CONFIDENCE COMING IN THIS COUNTER PARTIES TO KIND OF RELAX OF LIQUIDITY BASE IT'S NOT PRECISELY LIQUIDITY IS A LACK OF ABILITY TO PUT CAPITAL UP TO SMOOTH ANY IMBALANCE BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS AND A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT MARKET IT'S QUITE TECHNICAL WHICH SIT UNDERNEATH THIS BANKING SYSTEM PETER TOOK UP WELL IF I COME BACK I THINK THE THE
INTENTION OF REGULATORS WAS TO INCREASE CAPITALISATION OF BAGS BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY GAVE IN TO THIS CONCEPT OF ALLOWING THIS TYPE OF BAR TO BE USED AS CAPITAL SO INSTEAD OF RAISING THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY THAT WE REALLY WANTED BANKS TO DO MANY BAGS SOLVE THESE TINTED CAPITAL BAR AND AGAIN IT WAS GREAT TAX DEDUCTIBLE LOWER COST
BUT NOW THAT'S SORT OF COMING THROUGH ENOUGH UNFORTUNATELY WILL PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY FOR A VERY NERVY OUT THERE IN THE MARKET AT THE MOMENT THAT HE'D THE THOUGHTS OF A DARE TURN AND I REMEMBER HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY IN THE TEETH OF THE LAST CRISIS AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
WE SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE ENTIRELY THE POSSIBILITY THAT PUBLIC MONEY MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO RE CAPITALISE BANKS IN EXTREMIS SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY NEVER AGAIN AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN IS COMPLETE NONSENSE AND VERY DANGEROUS PETER HARM THE PUBLIC WILL STILL BE ON THE HOOK IF THE BANKS GO DOWN OF COURSE OF COURSE NOT IN AND AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RE REMEMBER THAT
THE U.K. DIDN'T INVEST IN ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND IT BASICALLY KEPT THE KIRSCH COMING OUT OF THE CHAOS RECEDES AND KEPT THE ECONOMY GOING OR WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE THAT STUPID TO SAY F. IT'S NECESSARY WE HAVE TO DO THAT O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS BOTHERING THE MARKET THE FOOTIE NOW IS THAT A THREE YEAR LOW MARKETS LOOK VERY JITTERY YOU TALKED YOU KNOW POLICY MAKERS THEY SAY RELAX IT'S FIVE THE WORLD'S NOT GOING TO HELP HELEN A HANDCART HOW DO YOU AS AN INVESTMENT MANAGER
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BROADER GLOBAL ECONOMY WHICH IS STILL GROWING THREE THREE AND A HALF PER CENT ISH SOMETHING LIKE THAT THIS YEAR MOST ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD IN A GROWTH PHASE FOR ASSIST THIS REAL CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE THAT WE'RE SEEING IN MARKET AND MARKETS
I THINK PART OF IT DOES COME FROM THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAD NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT HOW ROBUST IT REALLY WILL PROVE IF THERE IS ANOTHER CRISIS BUT I THINK THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF THE GEO POLITICAL STUFF WHICH IS CONCERNING WE HEARD OBVIOUSLY THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT WORRIES PEOPLE AS WELL I THINK AS AN INVESTOR IT'S THE THING TO BEAR IN MIND AS IF YOU CAN BUY SOMETHING MORE CHEAPLY TODAY THEN YOU COULD BUY IT YESTERDAY
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY AND YOU SHOULD FIGURE OUT IF THE PRICE CHANGE IN THE MARKET IS REALLY THIS AT MATCHING THE UNDERLINE CHANGE IN VALUE NO EXPERIENCES WITH MANY MANY COMPANIES THAT THE SHARE PRICES MUCH MORE VOLATILE THAN ANY CHANGE AND ACTUALLY THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS STRENGTH IN THE COMPANIES WHICH MIGHT INVEST SO YOU SHOULD BE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT BEING A LITTLE BIT CONTRARIAN WHEN MARKETS ARE LIKE THIS THE WORSE IT FEELS
MORE LIKELY TO MAKE SOME MONEY OUT OF IT ALL RIGHT I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT BANKS NOW THEY'RE ON SUCH A LOT OF THE MARKETS AND THE AFTERMATH OF THE LAST CRISIS BANKS WERE REQUIRED TO HOLD MUCH MORE SHOCK ABSORBING CAPITAL WHICH IS DISCUSSING THAT MEANT THEY WERE LESS INCLINED OR ABLE TO LEND MANY BORROWERS WERE DECLINED AT THE SAME TIME INTEREST RATES ARE NOW BEEN REDUCED TO ZERO SO SAVE US INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED SO MANY WERE THINKING BANKS WHO NEEDS TO STEP UP
PEER TO PEER LENDING WAS THE ARTS THAT PLATFORMS THAT MATCH INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO NEED CASH WITH THOSE WHO HAVE SOME TO LEND AND IT'S IMPROVED ENCRYPTS PROVED INCREASINGLY POPULAR BUT LORD TURNER AGAIN MY CONVERSATION WITH HIM YESTERDAY HEAD OF THE F.S.A. AT ONE STAGE HAD THIS RATHER STARK WARNING ON EXPECTED
I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE LOSSES ON PEER TO PEER LENDING WHICH WILL EMERGE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL MAKE THE WORST BANKERS LOOK LIKE ABSOLUTE LENDING GENIUSES YOU CANNOT LEND MONEY TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN PARTICULAR WITHOUT SOMEBODY GOING AND DOING GOOD CREDIT UNDERWRITING THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN JUST AUTOMATE THAT ONTO A PLATFORM I THINK IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY BUT I THINK IT WILL END UP PRODUCING BIG LOSSES
PRETTY STERN STUFF THERE FROM AN ALTERNATE HE'S GOING TO SEE BIG LOSSES IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS SOME PEER TO PEER LENDING RISK MANAGEMENT IS NOT FOR THE DAMAGE I THINK IS REALLY GOOD BUT WHAT'S REALLY HOW PROFESSIONALS THAT BRILLIANT JONATHAN NO ABSOLUTELY BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS DIFFERENT PLAYERS DIFFERENT TYPES OF ASSETS IN THE
BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS INVESTORS TAKING EQUITY RISK EMP RACING IT IS DAD AGAIN AND IT'S NOT THAT DISSIMILAR FROM MISS PRICING CERTAIN BANDS AND BAGS AND WE COME DOWN THIS KIND OF SEARCH FOR A YEAR OLD AND I REMEMBER EVEN IN BANKS TODAY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT BANKS PUT A LOT OF MONEY GOVERNMENT BY HANS NO YIELD AND THEY WANT IT THEY PAY INVESTORS FOR O.K. WE WILL HAVE MORE OF THAT OF HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT PEER TO PEER LENDERS IN THE IN THE NEXT HOUR OR A TURN NOW TO THE EYE LIKE THAT TO THE THE
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EXCUSE WE WANT SECONDS DOESN'T I'VE GOT MY PAPERS AT A BIT OF A MUDDLE HERE IT'S A TIME OF YEAR AND RICHARD'S WHEN SHAREHOLDER STOP BEATING TO SCRUTINISE THE PAY OF BOSSES PAY UP OF BOSSES U.K.'S BIGGEST FIRMS THEY WERE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TASK ACCORDING TO A REPORT OUT TODAY IT WAS EXECUTIVE PAY DEALS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND NO ONE CAN REALLY TELL IF THEY OFFER GOOD VALUE PETER MUM TONY AND HIS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT THE INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS ETHICS AND AUTHOR OF FAIR OR UNFAIR GETTING TO GRIPS
WITH EXECUTIVE PAY PETER MONTAGNE YOU SAYING THE PROBLEM STARTS OF CLARITY NOT QUANTITY IT IS CLARITY FOR ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS THAT THESE SCHEMES ARE NOW SO COMPLICATED THAT WHEN THEY ARE GIVEN TO EXECUTIVES THE EXECUTIVES DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE WORTH TO PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING THEM HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS LIKE ANNE WHO HAVE TO VOTE ON THESE SCHEMES ARE MUST HAVE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY IN KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON WE DO YOU NEED A SYSTEM WHICH WORKS BETTER AND IS ABOVE ALL SIMPLE
BUT IS IT A MANAGEMENT SEEMS TO DO BRILLIANTLY AT LIMITING OR REDUCING EVERY COST APART FROM ITSELF AND EVERY BOARD OF DIRECTORS SAYS THEY WANT TO TOP COR TILE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE IF EVERYONE WANTS THE TOP QUARTER CHIEF EXECUTIVE THEN IT ENDS UP RATCHETING UP THE PAY FOR EVERYONE YES THAT IS A PROBLEM AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REMUNERATION COMMITTEES HAVE TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT MORE CAREFULLY HE'S THE LIMITS THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR THEIR PEOPLE IN THEIR JOBS THEY NEED TO BE MUCH CLEARER ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE PREPARED TO GO AND HOW FAR THEY'RE PREPARED TO PAY THIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF
CRITICISM THAT COMES FROM OUTSIDE BUSINESS IS PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I THINK IT UNDERESTIMATES THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE IN GETTING THIS RIGHT ONE OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS IS NOT THE AMOUNT BY THE WAY BUT THE SPEED WITH WHICH IT'S DELIVERED YOU CAN GET VERY RICH IN THREE YEARS AS A LEADER OF THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES OR YOU CAN EARN VERY LITTLE BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE NEED IS SIMPLER SYSTEM WHICH IS DELIVERED PROBABLY OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE WE'RE GETTING VALUE
MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY THIS IS NO ONE'S PROBLEM APART FROM SHAREHOLDERS THE PEOPLE IN THE COMPANY AND THEY AND RICHARD DON'T SEEM TO CARE WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD SO MANY TIMES I THINK THEY DO I THINK THEY DO CARE THEY CARE QUITE PASSIONATELY AND PETER AND I HAVE HAD MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC AND WE ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT ABOUT IT SIMPLISTIC BELONGING TO PAY BILLS AND IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT VOTING PATTERNS YOU WILL SEE THOSE HAPPENED BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT REMEMBER WE NEED WELL MANIC WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU VOTED AGAINST HER PUT A REMUNERATION REPORT
WE VOTED AGAINST A NUMBER OF REMUNERATION REPORTS AND WE DO AN AWFUL LOT ENGAGEMENT BEHIND THE SCENES TO TO TO CHALLENGE AND TO SHAPE REMUNERATION REPORTS BEFORE THEY EVER GET TO THE VOTE TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO ALONG WITH THIS YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT IT'S QUITE AND RICHARDS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGER PETER MONTAGNE FROM LEEDS SHOULD HAVE BUSINESS ETHICS MANY THANKS

THANK YOU CAROLINE IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN I'M OF THE QUEEN'S HOSPITAL ROMFORD THIS MORNING FOR THE SECOND OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS STRIKES WHICH ARE HITTING ENGLAND NOW IF YOU ASK THE DOCTORS HERE WHO ARE WAITING TO MAN THE PICKET LINE WHOSE FAULT IT IS THAT VERY CLEAR JEREMY HUNT'S THEY WILL TELL YOU IT IS THE HEALTH SECRETARY'S FAULT ASK HIM
HE IS EQUALLY CLEAR IT IS THE B.M.A. W'S FAULT SO WHAT IS THE TRUTH OF IT ALL LET'S TALK TO OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM BRIM ILLER ADAM THIS SUGGESTION THE ALLEGATION REALLY FROM THE B.M.A. YESTERDAY WAS THERE MY HUNT HAD TURNED DOWN AN OFFER TO BRING THIS TO AN END
YES THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT IN RECENT NEGOTIATIONS IT CAME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT WAS DELIVER A BALL AND SUSTAINABLE UNLESS WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RE CLASSIFY THE NORMAL WORKING WE CAN PARE BACK THE WEEKEND HOURS THAT COMMAND PREMIUM PAY RATES SO IT BECOMES EASIER FOR HOSPITALS TO TO ROSTER DOCTORS AT WEEKENDS AND THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS OF COURSE ARE ALREADY WORKING WEEKENDS AND IT WANTS TO KEEP
PREMIUM RATES FOR SATURDAY'S HIS SUGGESTED THIS COULD BE DONE BY TAKING SOME OF THE MONEY OUT OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN BASIC PAY WHICH IS CURRENTLY A PROPOSAL OF ELEVEN PER CENT INCREASE HIVE OFF SOME OF THAT TO FUND A PREMIUM PAID FOR SATURDAY SO THE INCREASE IN BASIC PAY WOULD GO TO SOMETHING LIKE
FOUR OR FIVE PER CENT POSSIBLY UP TO TWO SEVEN PER CENT BUT SOME MONEY WOULD BE SAVED SO DO HAVE A BIT OF THE POT OF MONEY WHICH YOU COULD PUT IN TO PROTECT PREMIUM PAY FOR SATURDAY'S BUT THAT PROVED NOT TO BE A RUNNER
IN A SENSE NO WONDER IT PROVED TO BE NO RUNNER SURELY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT'S WHOLE POINT THE N.H.S. EMPLOYERS WHOLE POINT IS SATURDAY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER DAY IF YOU'RE REAL ON A SATURDAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED JUST AS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED ON A MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY OR FRIDAY AND THE BARE MAYOR SAYING WE'VE DO YOU STILL WANT A PREMIUM ALBEIT A DIFFERENT SORT OF PREMIUM
YEAH THE B.M.A. THOSE SAYS THAT THIS IS A DEAL THAT IS DELIVERABLE IT YOU CAN SEE UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT THEY ARGUED THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS DO YOU WORK ACROSS WEEKENDS IT IT CAN BE DONE AND IT'S ALSO SAYING THAT REALLY IF YOU WERE TO TRY TO IMPOSE THE CONTRACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS
HE'S SETTING OUT THEN DOCTORS SIMPLY WON'T WEAR IT THEY WERE WALKED OUT BE A HUGE RETENTION PROBLEM DOCTORS WILL EITHER HEAD ABROAD OR PURSUE OTHER CAREERS MAYBE WORK AND ACADEMIA OR EVEN JUST DO LOCUM WORK AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT YOU WOULD LOSE A GENERATION OF DOCTORS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE N.H.S. CAN'T AFFORD
ADMIRABLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MORE FROM HIM IT THE TIME NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN VOTE BERNIE SANDERS HAS WON IT FOR THE DEMOCRATS LET'S SPEAK TO JIM WHO
HE'S IN THE STATE AND JIM THEY HAVE BOTH WON BIG FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS THEY HAVE AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY SAID I MEAN THEY WERE EXPECTED THESE CAMPAIGNS WERE A HEAD AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISING LOOKING AT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE EITHER HAD LOST BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE
EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT OF THESE RESULTS ON THE TWO PARTIES JUST TO GIVE YOU THE FIGURES STILL BOATS DRIBBLING IN WE KNOW PRETTY WELL WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE A DONALD TRUMP ONE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE PRIMARY BYE
JUST UNDER TWENTY PER CENT IT SEEMS OVER THE OR HIGHER GOVERNOR JOHN CASEY AND THEN CRUISE BUSH RUBIO COMING BEHIND CHRIS CHRISTY'S HOME IN NEW JERSEY ORMER CERTAINLY PULL OUT CARLY IF YOU HONOUR AND THEN CARSON ARE PRETTY WELL OUT OF IT NOW TINY BUT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE
HUGE WIN FOR BERNIE SANDERS THE VAN WHAT SENATOR THE NEXT DOOR ESTATE FROM HERE OVER HILLARY CLINTON BY TWENTY PER CENT BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN RUN WHEN SHE MADE HER VERY VERY FEISTY
THE SPEECH WAS MORE PASSION IN IT THE CHEAT'S MANAGED ON THIS CAMP IN QUITE OFTEN TONIGHT AND THEN THEY ALL FLEW BACK TO NEW YORK AND THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION THAT THAT CAMPION WILL BE SHAKEN UP AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS VERY BIG WINS ON BOTH SIDES FOR
IN A SENSE THE TWO OUTSIDERS DONALD TRUMP AND BERNIE SANDERSON I'M FROM BERNIE SARDIS POINT OF VIEW DOES IT CHANGES POSITION I MEAN IT'S ALMOST HIS HAD HOME TURF ISN'T IT WELL IT IS HIS HOME TURF IN THE QUESTION'S ALWAYS BEEN CAN HE SURVIVE ELSEWHERE NOW HE SAID TONIGHT HE MADE HER EXTREMELY LONG AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH I WAS ACTUALLY AT HIS AT HIS SORT OF PARTY AND CONQUERED THE STATE CAPITAL ABOUT TWENTY MILES NORTH OF WHERE I AM IN MANCHESTER AT THE MOMENT AND HE DID GO ON AND ON A BIT BUT HE SAID LOOK THIS IS NOW A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN WE CAN DO IT HE SAID
THE IDEA OF BEATING HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION WHICH MOST PEOPLE HAD THOUGHT MOST PEOPLE TO BE HONEST IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STILL THINK VERY UNLIKELY OUTCOME IS ONE THAT HE SEES IN HIS SIGHTS AND IN A SENSE TO LINK QUESTIONS HERE
CAN ANYONE OF THE REPUBLICAN SIDE SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED DONALD TRUMP MANY OF THEM WITH THEY WANT TO BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO THE CHALLENGER'S GOING TO BE AN ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT BERNIE COULD BEAT HILLARY
SOMETHING THAT WAS ONCE THOUGHT IT EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY STILL I THINK THOUGHT UNLIKELY BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE
THEY'RE BOTH MOVEMENTS THERE IT JUST JUST THE LAST WORD IN THIS WOUND WITH BE COMING BACK LATER OBVIOUSLY THEATRE AND AN HOUR TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORE BUT IT BOTH CANDIDATES STRANGE SORT OF ECHOES BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS OF SANDERSON TRUMP BECAUSE THEY BOTH SAY THE BOTH OUTSIDERS AND THEIR OWN PARTIES
THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT AND THE CAMPAIGN THIS IS A MOVEMENT THERE BOTH SAYING THE SAME THING AND IT HAS SHAKEN THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF CAMPAIGNING TO ITS CORE
WONDERFUL STUFF JIM A THANKS VERY MUCH AND AS YOU SAY WILL BE COMING BACK TO IT MOLLY SPEAK TO BERNIE SANDERS BROTHER WHO IS AND WHAT HE WAS A GREEN PARTY COUNCILLOR AND HE'S AN ACADEMIC HE'S LIVED HERE FOR FOR DECADES THE GYM FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY TO SEVEN A NEW TEST FORCE IS BEING LAUNCHED THIS MORNING TO TACKLE FRAUD THE IDEA TO GET THE GOVERNMENT POLICE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES AND THE BANKS ALL WORKING TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY I REFERS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SHAW JOINS US ON THE LINE HE CAN TELL US MORE THIS PRESUMED DANNY A REFLECTION REALLY OF THE FACT THAT THE POLICE THE GOVERNMENT INDEED NOW HAVE TO TREAT FRAUD VERY SERIOUSLY IS A MAJOR CRIME
YES AND I THINK THE DRIVER FOR THAT NICK IS THE FACT THAT FRAUD IS GOING TO BE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE OFFICIAL CRIME SURVEY FOR ENGLAND AND WALES THAT'S THE SURVEY THAT THE GOVERNMENT REGARDS AS THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF CRIME TRENDS WE HAD AN INDICATION FROM THE CRIME SURVEY LAST YEAR THAT THERE WERE FIVE POINT ONE MILLION FRAUDS IN A YEAR FROM THIS YEAR IT WILL BE PART OF THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YEAR ON YEAR COMPARISONS
AND I THINK THAT IS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS NEW EFFORTS TO LINK TOGETHER THE VARIOUS BRANCHES THAT TACKLE FRAUD FROM THE BANKS' LAW ENFORCEMENT AS YOU SAY AND GOVERNMENT AS WELL THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF SORT OF REINVENTING THE WHEEL HERE BECAUSE WE DID HAVE THE NATIONAL STRATEGIC FRAUD AUTHORITY THEN WE HAD THE NATIONAL FRAUD AUTHORITY THEY WAS SCRAPPED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO NOW WE'VE GOT IT THIS NEW JOINT TASK FORCE SO IT DOES FEEL A BIT OF A DAY EACH OTHER YOU SENSE
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A LIST YOU TELL US ABOUT GOD AND ORGANISED FRAUD GANGS I SUPPOSE THE DANGER OF HAVING A SORT OF MOST WANTED LIST IS THERE LOTS OF ROAST AS WOULD RATHER LIKE TO BE ON IT WHAT THEY WOULD SAY RATHER GLAMOROUS FOR YES I DON'T THINK THAT LIST IS QUITE READY YET BUT THE INDICATIONS I'VE HAD FROM THE POLICE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO DO TO TRY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER IT COULD WELL BE NOT SIMPLY A A PARTICULAR FRAUDSTER BUT A
ORGANISED FRAUD GANG THAT GETS ONTO THE LIST I THINK THE IDEA IS TO SHOW THAT THESE ARE NASTY PEOPLE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LINKED TO SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME AND THAT FRAUD IS NOT A VICTIMLESS CRIME BEHIND IT LIES LOTS OF MISERY FOR PEOPLE WHO LOSE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND IT'S TO TRY AND I THINK DRIVE THAT MESSAGE HOME AS WELL AS AS BE A DETERRENT TO OTHERS WHO ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT WANT TO END UP ON THE LIST BUT WOULD RATHER REMAIN ANONYMOUS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THIS MORNING IN THE TIMES THE TELEGRAPH BOTH SUGGEST THE DRINK DRIVE LIMIT COULD BE CUT BY A THIRD IN ENGLAND AND WALES WHICH WOULD BRING IT INTO LINE WITH SCOTLAND THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IF EVIDENCE SHOWS THE POLICY IN SCOTLAND HAS BEEN A SUCCESS THEN MINISTERS WILL CONSIDER MAKING THE CHANGE THE TIMES NOTES IT WOULD BE THE FIRST CUT IN ALMOST FIFTY YEARS
AND WOULD LIMIT MOTORISTS TO LESS THAN A PINT OF BEER OR A GLASS OF WINE IF THEY WANT TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL IT'S LEADING ARTIC LEADER ARTICLE TAKES A DIFFERENT TERM WONDERING WHERE THE DRIVERLESS CARS MAY BE THE ANSWER TO GETTING TIPSY PEOPLE HOME FROM THE PUB

GOVERNMENT FIGURES SHOW THAT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE WERE RETURNED TO AFGHANISTAN OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS A HOME OFFICE SPOKESMAN TELLS THE PAPER ALL APPLICATIONS TO REMAIN IN THE U.K. AND CONSIDERED
ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL MERITS DRAMATIC PICTURES OF A MAN KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY POWERFUL WAVES FEATURE IN THE EXPRESS IN THE MIRROR AN OXIDE IS A PHOTO OF AN INJURED WOMAN BOTH PAPERS REPORT THE COUPLE HAD BEEN TAKING PICTURES OF STORM IMOGEN ON NEWQUAY SAT SEAFRONT IN CORNWALL WHEN THEY WERE ENGULFED BY A WAVE THE EXPRESS SAYS THE WOMAN WAS LEFT WITH A BROKEN ARM AFTER BEING SWEPT FIFTY FEET AND THROWN UNDER A BOAT
SEVERAL PAPERS DEVOTE COVERAGE TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FUNDRAISER KNOWN AS THE BLACK AND WHITE BALL THE FINANCIAL TIMES DESCRIBES IT AS AN EVENING FOR THE RICH TO SHOWER THE PARTY WITH THE NATIONS BUT IT SAYS THE TENSIONS OVER EUROPE
MEAN THE EVENT FELL FLAT AND CLAIMED THERE'S THOSE IN BLACK TIE WERE GRUMBLING AT MINISTERS WHO TURNED UP IN SUITS THE SUN'S ARTICLE IS CAPTURED INSIDE THE P.M.'S SECRETIVE FUNDRAISER HE REPORTS TO THE STANDARD TABLE TO ENJOY THE VENISON AND THE SEABASS COST
FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS BUT FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND YOU COULD SIT WITH A TOP CABINET MINISTER ALL THE MAYOR OF LONDON AND GET IT'S WHAT IT CALLS A BRUSH BY FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
HERE'S CLOSE THE BOOK ON VELLUM IS THE HEADLINE IN THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THE HOUSE OF LORDS HAS CONFIRMED THE END OF A THOUSAND YEAR OLD TRADITION OF PRINTING BRITAIN'S LAWS ON THE CALFSKIN MATERIAL THE ARTICLE KNEW ARCHIVE PAPER WILL LAST ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED YEARS COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL HANDMADE VELLUM WHICH CAN LAST FOR FIVE THOUSAND
AND THE DAILY MAIL IS ONE OF SEVERAL PAPERS TO PICK UP ON THE REACTION OF CRIMEWATCH VIEWERS TO A MUGSHOT OF A WANTED MAN THAT APPEARED ON MONDAY NIGHT'S PROGRAMME MANY COMMENTED THAT THE MAN
WANTED FOR ATTACKING A FRAIL PENSIONER BORE A RATHER STRIKING AN UNFORTUNATE RESEMBLANCE TO THE SHOW'S NEW PRESENTER JASON MOHAMMED THE DAILY STAR'S HEADLINE CALLS HIM A CROOK ALIKE
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE TAKING PART IN THE SECOND HOUR STRIKE OVER PAY AND SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE OVER PAY AND CONDITIONS MINISTER SAY NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN THEIR SPEND
A SYSTEM OF WEARING BRIGHTLY COLOURED WRISTBANDS FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS WAS COMPARED TO SIMILAR SCHEMES FOR HOLIDAYMAKERS LEAST IN EVIDENCE GIVEN TO PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY M.P.S MADE CLEAR THEIR DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA TO THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY BEHIND THE SCHEME SUSAN HUME REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
THE HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE SEEM TO BE WRESTLING WITH A MORAL QUESTION WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO COME HERE CLAIMING REFUGEE STATUS FOR EXAMPLE THOSE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND CARDIFF WHO IT EMERGED HAD TO WEAR WRISTBANDS TO SHOW THEY WERE ENTITLED TO MEALS WAS THAT RIGHT LABOUR'S TOOK AT MONNOW WAS PRETTY CLEAR IT WASN'T HE VERY MUCH HAS THE WIT
OF TREATING PEOPLE NOT AS IF THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS BUT IS IF THEY'RE LIKE FINS AND NUMBER TO BE MAN
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT HE WAS TALKING TO JAMES VIVIEN ROBINSON THE CHIEF OF THE COMPANY CLEAR SPRING WHICH OPERATED THE WRISTBAND POLICY NOW ABANDONED HE SAID HE WASN'T DEFENDING THE PRACTICE IF WE THOUGHT THERE WAS WOOD CALLS THERE FOR ALL THAT THEY HAD DONE
I'M SURE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE IMPLEMENTED YOU SHOULD NEVER WHAT MY POINT IS YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FIRST PLACE MOTHER THAT MEDIA STORY ABOUT IT HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE THAT THIS IS WRONG
THERE WAS A PAUSE A REALLY LONG ONE TYPE YOU WANT TO ASK US A QUESTION OH KAY SORRY YOU TALK OR WHISPER
AH A WIDELY USED WAY OF MONITORING PEOPLES
FOOD HOLIDAYS EXCEPT OF SUCH ACCEPT TROUT WITH WHOEVER WRISTBANDS LOTS OF PEOPLE WEAR WRIST BANDS WITH RESPECT THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT ON HOLIDAY CORRECT BUT THEY ARE EATING FOOD AND IT WAS A WAY OF THE ONE THING
THAT'S UTTERLY IMPORTANT
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE TO TREAT ASYLUM SEEKERS TOO WELL THE SITTER'S NEAR GATWICK PROVIDES ACCOMMODATION FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE FACING DEPORTATION THERE ARE NINE FLATS COOKING FACILITIES A CANTEEN AND EXTENSIVE PLAY AND ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES INCLUDING A MULTI GYM THERE'S A STAFF OF EIGHTY
BUT THE AUTHOR OF A HOME OFFICE REVIEW OF HOW VULNERABLE ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE TREATED STEVEN SHAW SAID THAT ON THE TWO OCCASIONS HE'D VISITED THERE WOULD BE NO FAMILY THERE AT ALL HE WASN'T CONVINCED IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT
IT'S A TIME WHEN THE HOME OFFICE AS MOST GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS ARE FACING A PERIOD OF AUSTERITY IT SEEMS TO ME AN ABSOLUTE
RAGE THAT SO MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT AT CEDARS SO TAKE A SINGLE MUM FACING DEPORTATION WHAT WOULD SHE MAKE OF IT YOU'RE PUTTING HER IN THIS THEY SORT OF PALATIAL
FACILITIES FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT SHE'S BEMUSED BY AND THEREFORE MAKES MENU SO IT'S ALMOST AN UNKINDNESS NOT A KIND YES TO DO IT IN THAT WAY
WELL HANDILY THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER JAMES BROCKEN SHIRE LONG TO A CONSERVATIVE REYNOLDS I WHY DINNER ASKED FOR HIS VIEW DO YOU THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT TO BE SPENDING MONEY ON
ALL SORTS OF LUXURIES THAT FRANKLY HARDWORKING FAMILIES CAN ILL AFFORD THINGS LIKE WIDESCREEN TELEVISION SKY SATELLITE CHANNELS AND INTERNET CAFE IN BASKETBALL COURT ON SITE DAVID'S APPROPRIATE JAMES BROKEN SHOWER INSISTED IMMIGRATION REMOVAL CENTRES WERE NOT PALATIAL BUT I THINK HAVING IMMIGRATION WE'VE ASSESSED WITH SOME FACILITIES TO MAKE THE MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS COUNTRY APPROPRIATE
IS IS AN APPROPRIATE SPENDING HER MONEY BUT THIS IS NOT IN MY VIEW THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUGAR COATED THAT THERE SHOULD BE EXCESSIVE AND CLEARLY WE KEEP THESE ISSUES ON THE CLOSE REVIEW
NOW THE PRIME MINISTER RECKONS THE U.K. MIGHT END UP HAVING TO DEAL WITH RATHER MORE ASYLUM SEEKERS THAN SHOULD THE REFERENDUM RESULT IN BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. DAVID CAMERON HAS CLAIMED THAT IF THE U.K. LEAVES THE FRENCH MIGHT REFUSE TO HAVE BRITISH BORDER CONTROLS ON THEIR SOIL THAT WOULD MEAN THERE WAS NOTHING TO STOP THE MIGRANTS IN THE SO CALLED KELLY JUNGLE FROM MAKING THE TRIP TO BRITAIN TO CLAIM ASYLUM BUT A CONSERVATIVE TIM LOUGHTON DIDN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE HIS BOSS
WHAT ON EARTH IS THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH THE PRIME TO STAKE
TIM LOTT AND ARGUED THAT THE BORDER CONTROL AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE WAS QUITE SEPARATE FROM THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. THE MINISTER JAMES BROKEN SHOWER FELT IT WAS ALL A LITTLE MORE NUANCED IT SEEM TO BE MORE ABOUT THE FRENCH GETTING FED UP WITH US MORRISSEY PUT IT I POINT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE SEE IN FRANCE AT THE MOMENT WITH A NUMBER OF POLITICAL PARTIES
THE CASING VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEN TO JUXTAPOSE CONTROLS THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT A VIEW OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE YOU BART'S
THE SITUATION COULD CHANGE
TIM LOUGHTON WAS NOT CONVINCED HE CALLED THE PRIME MINISTER'S ARGUMENT A BIT TENUOUS AND HIS EXPRESSION SUGGESTED HE WAS THINKING OF A STRONGER WORD
SUSAN YOU REPORTING THERE YOU CAN OF COURSE HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO NOW IT'S A COLD DAMP DARK MORNING HERE AT THE QUEEN'S HOSPITAL ROMFORD
PATIENTS ARE BEGINNING TO WALK IN THE ENTRANCE IS JUST OPEN AND THE STAFF ARE BEGINNING TO ARRIVE HERE AS WELL IN JUST OVER AN HOUR'S TIME THOUGH THEY WILL HAVE TO CROSS A PICKET LINE TO DO SO IT IS A REMINDER REALLY OF JUST HOW EXTRAORDINARY THIS JUNIOR'S DOCTORS STRIKE IN ENGLAND EARS PERHAPS BECAUSE IT'S RAWDON BALD ON FOR SO LONG WE'RE IN DANGER OF TAKING IT FOR GRANTED IT PEOPLE WHOSE VOCATION
HE'S CARING FOR OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT LIGHTLY WITHDRAW THAT
MANY TALK HERE OF A CRISIS OF MORALE OF FRIENDS OF COLLEAGUES PREPARING TO QUIT MEDICINE
OR TO QUIT THE COUNTRY EQUALLY MINISTERS THE EMPLOYERS THE MANAGERS ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE NEED FOR CARE TO BE AS GOOD AS SAFE ON A SATURDAY OR A SUNDAY AS IT IS ON ANY OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK
BOTH SIDES BLAME EACH OTHER FOR A DISPUTE THAT THEY INSIST IS UNNECESSARY DOCTORS THREATEN MORE STRIKES MINISTERS THREATENED TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT
THE RESULTS WILL HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN HERE TURNING UP TO BE CARED FOR TO BE TREATED NOT JUST FOR THE STAFF IN THE N.H.S. IN ONE HOSPITAL OR ALL OF THE HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND BUT IN TREES FOR THE N.H.S. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM BECAUSE IF MORALE PLUMMETS IF DOCTORS GIVE UP
THAT HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR US ALL AND OF COURSE WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THAT THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME
TO THE MANAGERS TO THE STAFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HERE
IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE LOWER HOUSE OF FRANCIS PARLIAMENT WILL VOTE TODAY ON WHETHER TO REMOVE FRENCH NATIONALITY FROM ANYONE WHO IS CONVICTED OF A TERRORIST OFFENCE THE PROPOSED NEW LAW WAS PUT FORWARD BY THE PRESIDENT AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER CHRISTOPH PRIM EYES A SOCIALIST M.P.

IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE REPUBLICAN BATTLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHILST HILLARY CLINTON WAS WELL BEATEN BY HER DEMOCRAT RIVAL BERNIE SAUNDERS THE GOVERNMENT IS LAUNCHING A NEW TASK FORCE TO TACKLE FRAUD ACROSS THE U.K.
WITH THAT IN THE REST OF THE B.B.C. NEWS HERE IS CAROLINE NICHOLS

BOTH SIDES ACKNOWLEDGE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE SINCE THE LAST WALK OUT IN JANUARY BUT ON A CRUCIAL ISSUE OF PAY FOR UNSOCIABLE HOURS THERE'S NO SIGN OF A BREAKTHROUGH
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IN THE INTERESTS OF SAFETY IT WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HOSPITALS TO ROSTER MORE DOCTORS AT WEEKENDS THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT CAN HAPPEN UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT IT WANTS TO PROTECT PREMIUM PAY RATES FOR SATURDAYS AND ARGUES THIS COULD BE FUNDED BY LIMITING THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN BASIC PAY TO BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN PER CENT RATHER THAN THE ELEVEN PERCENT ON OFFER
THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED THE TIME TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT IS FAST APPROACHING SOURCES SAY PLANNING FOR THIS IS ALREADY UNDERWAY THE B.M.A. SAYS THIS WOULD BE AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER SERVING ONLY TO ALIENATE DOCTORS STILL MORE FURTHER DISRUPTION LOOKS INCREASINGLY LIKELY
A BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP AND THE LEFT WING DEMOCRAT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS HAVE WON THE BACKING OF VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE CONTEST TO BECOME CANDIDATES FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY HILLARY CLINTON LOST THE DEMOCRAT VOTE BY MORE THAN TWENTY POINTS AMONG THE REPUBLICANS THE OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN CASE IT CAME SECOND LEADING THE OTHER CANDIDATES VYING FOR THIRD PLACE HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL WHO IS IN THE CITY OF MANCHESTER
THESE ARE TRULY TO JAW DROPPING RESULTS A YEAR AGO NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT FAINTLY CONCEIVABLE THAT TO OUTSIDERS ONE FROM THE LEFT AND ONE FROM THE RIGHT WOULD CAPTURE SENSIBLE SOLID NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT THEY HAVE AND NOT BY A SQUEAK BUT BY A COUNTRY MILE DONALD TRUMP THE BILLIONAIRE PROPERTY DEVELOPER WHO'S NEVER HELD ANY ELECTED OFFICE WAS EUPHORIC AS THE ADDRESS SUPPORTERS
WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A MARACA SO GREAT AGAIN MAY BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE
AND THE VICTORY OF BERNIE SANDRA'S IS NO LESS REMARKABLE THE SELF DESCRIBED SOCIALIST SENATOR FROM VERMONT HAS ENERGISED AND ELECTRIFIED THE DEMOCRATIC RACE WHICH WAS MEANT TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD VICTORY PROCESSION FOR HILLARY CLINTON HE PROMISED NOTHING LESS THAN A POLITICAL REVOLUTION TONIGHT WAS
THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COUNTRY
PEOPLE WILL NOT CONTINUE TO WORK SERVE A CAROTID CARE PAID FINE
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE PART OF THAT AND THE BIG LOSER LAST NIGHT THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE MAINSTREAM THE DISAFFECTION OF VOTERS WITH WASHINGTON POLITICS IS PROFOUND AND THAT MEANS THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE UNKNOWABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE
POLICE SAY THEY FOUND THE BODY OF THE ONLY PERSON WHO ARE STILL MISSING AFTER THE HEAD ON TRAIN CRASH IN SOUTHERN GERMANY YESTERDAY IT MEANS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE ACCIDENT HAS NOW RISEN TO ELEVEN INVESTIGATORS ARE EXAMINING THE WRECKAGE AND BLACK BOX RECORDERS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHY THE TRAINS COLLIDED ON A BEND IN THE TRACK NEAR BUT BY PLAYING IN BAVARIA
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WARNED THAT TEACHER SHORTAGES IN ENGLAND ARE GROWING AFTER RECRUITMENT TARGETS WERE MISSED FOR THE FOURTH YEAR RUNNING A REPORT BY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS MINISTERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND LOCAL PRESSURES RESULT IN MORE SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS BEING TAUGHT BY TEACHERS WHO DON'T HAVE A DEGREE IN THE RELEVANT SUBJECT I TOOK ATION EDITOR BROWN GEOFFREY'S HAS MORE DETAILS

DAVID CILLA TAE REPORTING THERE I'M STANDING OUTSIDE THE QUEEN'S HOSPITAL IN ROMFORD A PATIENT HAS JUST ARRIVED IN THE AMBULANCE IT'S BEEN TAKEN INTO THE RENAL UNIT A REMINDER OF WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THIS DISPUTE BETWEEN JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND IT IS A DISPUTE ABOUT CARE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT INSISTING THAT IT IS ONLY ABOUT BY CHANGING THEIR PAY BY CHANGING THE CONDITIONS THAT WE ALL GET THE CARE WE NEED NOT JUST MONDAY TO FRIDAY
BUT ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS WELL THE JUNIOR DOCTORS ON STRIKE INSISTING THAT THIS WILL MAKE CARE WORSE FOR PEOPLE IT WILL MAKE THE N.H.S. MORE DANGEROUS NO N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND APPOINTMENTS INCLUDING MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED PLAN DIDN'T PATIENT PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN CANCELLED AS A RESULT OF TODAY'S INDUSTRIAL ACTION
EMERGENCY IN TAKE HER CARRIES ON OF COURSE BUT HOW WILL HOSPITALS COPE WILL BE TALKING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE HERE IN JUST A MOMENT BUT ARE APPALLED TO SEE MY CONJECTURE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO STAFF AND PATIENTS
YOU JUST TELL HER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP BEFORE CLOCK MEETING ISN'T MY NAME'S RUSSELL AND THE DECORATIVE EXEC AT BARKING HAVING A REP BRIDGE HOSPITALS JUST THROUGH HERE
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE STANDING NOW SO NOW WE'RE IN THE CORE OF THE HOSPITAL JUST OUTSIDE THE OPERATION CENTRE AND THAT'S AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IS DOWN TO THE LEFT AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF MISTING UNITS JUST ALONGSIDE IT AND WHERE ARE WE HEADING NOW SO WE'RE GOING TO HEAD TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE THE HOSPITAL JUST WEIGH A COUPLE OF OUR OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENTS
WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY JUST TALK ME THROUGH HOW BIG THIS HOSPITAL MEALS WE SERVE A POPULATION OF AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE IN OUT OF NORTH EAST LONDON AND IN ESSEX HOW MANY DOCTORS ARE YOU EXPECTING
NOT TO TURN UP TODAY SO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY JUNIOR DOCTORS WHO WERE AN ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE PART OF OUR WORKFORCE THEY WORK IN OUR WARDS OUR OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENTS IN SOME OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC DEPARTMENTS SO WILL HAVE FULLY STAFFED EMERGENCY ROTAS
DOCTORS DON'T HAVE TO TELL US IN ADVANCE WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO COME TO WORK OR WHETHER THEY INTEND TO TAKE ACTION HOWEVER WE WERE SHORT AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF JUNIOR DOCTORS TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES IN THE HOSPITAL
WE'RE JUST STANDING OUTSIDE THE OUTPATIENTS PART OF THE HOSPITAL
IS THE AREA THAT WILL BE IMPACTED TODAY THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS THAT WE OFFER I'M SO WE'VE WRITTEN TO PATIENTS IN ADVANCE TO SAY THAT WE WOULD NEED TO REARRANGE THE APPOINTMENT HOWEVER
IT WON'T BE ALL OUT PATIENTS WHO HAVE TO HAVE THEIR PLANNED APPOINTMENT CHANGED WITH US AND PATIENTS HERE YOU NEED TO BE SEEN URGENTLY AND WILL STILL BE SEEN TODAY AND PATIENTS WHO NEED SURGERY FOR URGENT OPERATIONS THAT WILL ALL GO AHEAD TODAY
IT'S YOUR WIFE IS EPILEPTIC AND OUTPATIENTS AN OUTPATIENT OF WON'T SHE CAME FROM A BROKEN
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE STRIKE THEY DO LONG HOURS WELL SHOULDN'T
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT WE HAVEN'T WE WE DON'T MIND IF IT TAKES YOU AWAY THERE BIT ALONG GO ON BUT WHO CARES I DO A GOOD JOB THE WHICH ACTUALLY DO OR THAN ANOTHER STAR WHITE THEY TOY WITH YOU I DON'T WANT SOMEONE LOOKING AFTER HER ROOM OOZE THAT TOY
STUFFED FULL FULLY STUFF ROTA HE DIE AT BOTH SITES AND THE ON CALL THAMES MERIDEN A COMIC AND THE DEPUTY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
SO THERE'S THE RUNNING OF THE HOSPITAL SO ALL THE OPERATIONAL AREAS AND ALL THE SERVICES SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT ADEQUATE COVER IN ALL THE SERVICES THAT WE CROSS CHECK WHICH DOCTORS HAVE ARRIVED AND THAT WE'VE GOT ADEQUATE DOCTOR TO DELIVER THAT SURFACE SO THIS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR YOU IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE RELY QUITE HEAVILY ON OUR JUNIOR DOCTORS FOR COVER
I AM HOWEVER A CONSULTANT WORKFORCE HAVE STEPPED OPTED TO PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL COVER HOW MUCH WORK HAVE YOU NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT TODAY RUNS SMOOTHLY THIS IS A VERY LARGE HOSPITAL SO THE WORK INVOLVED HAS BEEN QUITE EXTENSIVE TEAR AND SHARE THAT WE'VE GOT ADEQUATE COVER FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT CONTINUE TO RUN THAT WE COUNT CANCEL AND ULTIMATELY THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PATIENTS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH EVERYONE ADEQUATELY WHAT WE CAN COUNT TO
SEE WE COULD TOUCH HER REPORTING THERE WELL I'M JOINED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARKING AVERY HAD REDBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS USED TO BE CALLED A NICE SIMPLE THING QUEENS HOSPITAL ROMFORD IS KNOWN AS THAT BY MOST PEOPLE MATTHEW HOPKINS IT'S HERE WE'RE TALKING WHAT HAVE DOZENS OF OPERATIONS HAVING TO BE CANCELLED MY HOPKINS YES OR NUMBERS OF CANCELLATIONS TODAY WILL BE ABOUT FORTY FIVE
OPERATIONS AND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT LESSON LAST TIME THAT VIRGINIA DOCTORS TOOK TOOK INDUSTRIAL ACTION HOW ANXIOUS HE'D YOU HOW ANXIOUS OF MEDICAL STAFF THAT THIS ISN'T JUST AN INCONVENIENCE TO PATIENTS BUT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL SIR
WELL AS A FORMER NURSE AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE TRUST MY MAIN CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT SERVICES ARE A HIGH QUALITY AND SAFE PATIENTS ANY SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR CHANGES TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE DELIVER OUR OUTPATIENT OPERATION OPERATIONS TO TO PATIENTS AS CLEARLY
UNHELPFUL AND THAT DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE FOR BUT WE'VE TRIED TO MINIMISE IT AS BEST WE COULD TODAY YOU ARE AS YOU SAY A LONG TERM HEALTH CAN PROFESSIONAL DE CHESTER A BUREAUCRAT AS IT WERE
WHAT UNDERLIES THIS DISPUTE IT'S VERY EASY TO GET LOST IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF THIS OR THAT EXTRA PAYMENT THE SWORD THAT ANGRY WORD BETWEEN THE HEALTH SECRETARY AND THE HEALTHY UNION WHAT DO YOU THINK DEEP DOWN THIS IS REALLY ABOUT
ONE OF THE APPROACHES WE TAKE WITH OUR STAFF AND ALL STUFF THAT IS HERE AT OUR HOSPITALS ARE QUEENS AND KING GEORGE HOSPITAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS AND WE RUN A NUMBER OF LISTENING EVENTS FOR OUR JUNIOR DOCTORS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE RIPEN BETWEEN SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND JUNIORS AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT CLEARLY ARJUN OUR JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT SENSE OF
FEELING THAT THAT THEIR VIEWS ARE BEING LISTENED TO AND THINGS SUCH AS EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR CAREERS WILL DEVELOP A CONSIDERED BUT THERE'S ALSO WOULD YOU LOT WHERE IT'S A PHRASE OFFERED OVERUSED THAT MORALE IS LOW BUT IN PRACTICAL TERMS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE N.H.S.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER SOMEONE'S CHEERFUL OR NOT IS IT IT'S ABOUT WHERE THE DOCTORS STAY IN THE PROFESSION STAY IN THE COUNTRY ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR JOBS WELL I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT ACTUALLY
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS IN MY EXPERIENCE ABOUT THIRTIES IN THE N.H.S. IS THAT ACTUALLY STAFF THAT FEEL LISTENED TO AND VALUED AND RESPECTED DELIVER MUCH BETTER CARE FOR PATIENTS AND FOR ME THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE IS THAT THAT ALL OF OUR STAFF INCLUDING OUR JUNIOR DOCTORS FEEL THAT THEIR VIEWS ARE BEING VALUED AND RESPECTED GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY CAN SEE
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE AND YET THERE ARE MINISTERS THERE ARE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO WOULD SAY TO YOU WOULD SAY TO JUNIOR DOCTORS WHICH SIMPLY HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT SATURDAY IS LIKE IT OR NOT JUST ANOTHER DAY IT'S A DAY WHEN IF YOU REALLY IF YOU NEED AN OPERATION YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS HOSPITAL THAN ANY HOSPITAL CAN GIVE YOU THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE NOT JUST WHATEVER YOU COULD MANAGE WITH THE STAFF WHO ARE PREPARED TO WORK FOR THE EXTRA PAYMENTS
AGAIN AS CHIEF EXEC TO MY MAIN CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING SAY SERVICES ACROSS THE WEAKENED AND I THINK IT'S EASY TO FORGET
THAT WE ALREADY DELIVER SEVEN DAY SERVICES AND OUR HOSPITALS AND THE IMPORTANT THING FOR FOR THIS DISPUTE IS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS CONCERNED INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PARTICULARLY COLLEAGUE SUCH AS DAVID ALTON AND CLAIRE PANIC FEEL ABLE TO PUT FORWARD THE VIEWS OF THE N.H.S. AND THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT RESOLVES THE DISPUTE QUICKLY FOR PATIENTS TO THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN VERY BRIEFLY UTIFUL THIS TO BE OVER
WELL AS I SAID THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO A CONCLUSION THAT HE'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PATIENTS MATTHEW HOPKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S BEEN A STARK WARNING OVER ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND SIMON IS HERE WITH MORE ON THAT THANK YOU SARAH YES PEER TO PEER LENDING IT'S BECOME VERY POPULAR IT USES THE INTERNET TO MATCH INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DON'T WHO NEED CASH WITH THOSE WHO HAVE SOME CASH TO LEND A SOLUTION FOR BORROWERS BANKS HAVE TURNED DOWN AND SAVERS WHO ARE GETTING FRUSTRATED AT THEIR LOW RETURNS
DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE BIG BANKS AND THE INTERNET'S ABILITY TO MATCH MAKE HAS SEEN THE INDUSTRY AS A SACRED QUICKLY IT DOUBLED IN SIZE IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE BUT AN INTERVIEW WITH A B. B. C. LORD TURNER REMEMBER THIS IS THE MAN PUT IN CHARGE OF BANK REGULATION JUST AS THE FINANCIAL CRISIS STRUCK SO A VERY BIG CHEESE AT THAT TIME HE PREDICTED BIG TROUBLE FOR THIS INDUSTRY
I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE LOSSES ON PEER TO PEER LENDING WHICH WILL EMERGE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL MAKE THE WORST BANKERS LOOK LIKE ABSOLUTE LENDING GENIUSES BECAUSE I THINK A GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO A LENDING PROCESS ON A TECHNICAL PLATFORM WITHOUT ANYBODY REALLY DOING
GO OUT AND KICK THE TYRES CREDIT ANALYSIS YOU CANNOT LEND MONEY TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN PARTICULAR WITHOUT SOMEBODY GOING AND DOING GOOD CREDIT UNDER WRITING WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING
WHERE ARE THESE PREMISES THAT THE GUY SAYS HE'S GOT WHAT ALL THE MACHINES HE'S GOT IT DOES HE REALLY KNOW OR SHE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN JUST AUTOMATE THAT ONTO A PLATFORM I THINK IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY BUT I THINK IT WILL END UP PRODUCING BIG LOSS IT DOES THAT MEAN THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY THE REPLACEMENT ORGANISATION FOR THE BODY USED TO HEAD IS ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL ON THIS
I THINK THERE IS TO A DEGREE AND ELEMENT OF CONDUCT WHERE THERE HAS TO BE A BIT OF BUYER BEWARE CAVEAT EMPTY
AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF PEOPLE ARE MIS SELLING IN THE SENSE OF IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING PEER TO PEER LANDING PLATFORMS WHO ARE PRETENDING THAT AS IT WERE THE SPONSOR IS DOING A DEGREE OF CREDIT UNDER WRITING CREDIT NOW SIS WHICH ISN'T THERE THEN THAT HAS TO BE CONSTRAINED BUT IF IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE MEANT TO BE
MAKING THEIR OWN CREDIT DECISION BY LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THEN YOU KNOW LIFE HAS TO HAVE SOME TOUGHNESS TO IT IF YOU DO CRAZY THINGS YOU DO HAVE TO SOMETIMES FACED THE COMMIES HOBBS THIS ART THIS IS NOT OF HITS GET INVESTORS THEIR ADVERTS ON THE TUBE FOR THIS STUFF I'VE GOT ON BUS STOPS WELL AGAIN I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL OF THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR IT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS CLEAR WARNINGS WITHIN IT I THINK WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE ONLY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS
IF THEY HAVE MONEY WHICH THEY CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THE SHOULD NOT BE A CORE PART OF THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN UNABLE TO CONSERVE CAPITAL WE NEED CLEAR WARNINGS
SO EXTRAORDINARY LANGUAGE THERE FROM THE FORMER FINANCIAL SUPREMO ABOUT THE RISKS OF PEER TO BE LENDING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE INDUSTRY BODY AFTER EIGHT THIRTY MEANWHILE IN THE TRADITIONAL BANKING INDUSTRY THERE WAS BIG TROUBLE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DEUTSCHE BANK WHOSE SHARES HAVE FALLEN MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS SAID ITS BALANCE SHEET IS ROCK SOLID THE MARKET CLEARLY DOES NOT AGREE LOVE MORE MATT ALSO BUT THEY FROM THERE
THANK YOU FOR THAT TIME AND IT'S TWENTY PAST SEVEN NO A NEW U.K. TASK FORCE IS BEING LAUNCHED THIS MORNING TO COMBAT FRAUD THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS ESTIMATES THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION INCIDENTS OF FRAUD IN ENGLAND AND WALES ALONE LAST YEAR THE COST TO CONSUMERS INDUSTRY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT RUNS INTO TENS OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS THAT ASPHALT BRINGS TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES OF GOVERNMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE BANKS WITH A PROMISE TO SHARE MORE INFORMATION CREATOR WANTED LIST OF FRAUDSTERS AND IMPROVE ADVICE
ON FRAUD PREVENTION ON HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SHAW HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE AT THE POLICE FIGHT AGAINST FRAUD
THIS IS THE MAIN FLOOR I FRAUD INTELLIGENCE BUREAU AND IF I'D BE SO HERE WE HAVE THE CRIME OF VIEWERS WHO ARE DOING THE REVIEWING AT REPORTS THROUGH ACTION FRAUD
AT THE GLASSY EMU OFFICES OF CITY OF LONDON POLICE NEAR THE GUILDHALL DETECTIVE INSPECTOR CHRIS FELTON TELLS ME ABOUT THE TEN THOUSAND REPORTS OF FRAUD HIS STAFF DEAL WITH EVERY WEEK
THEY SAY DIDN'T CHECK THE INFORMATION BEFORE DISTRIBUTING DETAILS TO LOCAL POLICE FORCES TO FOLLOW UP
THE INVESTIGATION OF FRAUD WAS ONCE A BACKWATER NOT ANY MORE WHO'S GROWING STEADILY GROWING I THINK IT'S COME UP ABOUT TEN PERCENT OVER THE LAST YEAR FRAUD IS ON THE RIGHT AND THE REPORTING A BIT IT'S GOING
IT'S A BIT OVERWHELMING ISN'T IT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND SO IT'S OVERWHELMING IT'S CERTAINLY HARD WORK AND WITH FREE OF HAVING CONSTANTLY TO ADAPT THE SYSTEM TO COPE WITH THOSE NUMBERS BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE GOING DOWN IN THE FUTURE THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE CRIME REVIEWERS SITTING AT COMPUTER TERMINALS ASSESSING ALL THOSE REPORTS IT HARDLY SEEMS ENOUGH
ON THE SCREEN IN FRONT OF SENIOR ANALYST CAROLINE TIMMY IS AN ARRAY OF DIAGRAM SYMBOLS AND CHARTS
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A SCREEN HERE WHICH HAS GOT A LIST OF ALL THE TYPES OF FRAUD
ANNE'S CODES RELATING TO THEM SO WE'VE GOT LOTTERY SCAMS DATING SCAM INHERITANCE FRAUD ADVANCE FEE FRAUD COMPUTER SOFTWARE SERVICE FRAUD
I NEVER KNEW THERE WERE SURE IF THEY'RE NOT HERE YES HE'S QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT CODES OF ALL THE FRAUDS WHICH OF HER MOST DIFFICULT TO CRACK WOULD YOU
I THINK THE DATING SCAM ON CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S MATTERS OF THE HEART SO DOES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THEM QUITE VULNERABLE AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST LOSSES
THAT POTENTIALLY COULD MAKE IT ONE OF THE HARDEST OTHERWISE THE COMPUTER SERVICE OFF FORWARD IT GOES OUTSIDE OF THE U.K. AND EVERYTHING GETS A BIT HARDER ONCE IT LEAVES OUR SHORES
IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS CITY OF LONDON POLICE HAS REPORTED A SURGE IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS C. O. FRAUD WHERE COMPANY BOSSES ARE ASKED TO AUTHORISE THE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ALMOST ONE THOUSAND CRIMES HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH THIRTY TWO MILLION POUNDS LOST TOM KEMP BOSS OF THE U.S. BASED SECURITY COMPANY CENTRIC MY CORPORATION CAME CLOSE TO BLOWING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ONE MORNING

HELLO I'M DAVID FROM BARCLAYS HE'S LYING I'M CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF UPGRADING YOUR ACCOUNT NO IT ISN'T SO I JUST NEED YOUR FULL PASSWORD
NO HE DOESN'T HE'S A SCAM ONCE I'VE GOT THAT I CAN LAST MONTH BARCLAYS LAUNCHED A T.V. AD CAMPAIGN WARNING CUSTOMERS TO BE MORE CAREFUL CHANGING BEHAVIOUR TO PREVENT FRAUD IS A KEY FEATURE OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT STRATEGY WE LOCK OUR DOORS OR WINDOWS WHEN WE LEAVE THE HOUSE WE SECURE OUR CARS SO WHY DON'T WE TAKE COMMON SENSE PRECAUTIONS WHEN WE OFFER DEALS OVER THE PHONE OR BY THINGS ONLINE
THE NATIONAL POLICE COORDINATOR FOR ECONOMIC CRIME COMMANDER CHRIS GREENY SAYS POLICE CAN'T SOLVE EVERY FRAUD SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION OURSELVES TO STOP IT HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE FRAUD IS ONE OF THE OLDEST CRIMES IN THE WORLD IT'S A TRICK IT'S A CONFIDENCE TRICK
PEOPLE ARE MADE TO BLEED RATHER I GET MORE MONEY OR THEIR MONEY'S CAN BE PROTECTED OR TO LOOK AT ROMANCE FRAUD THERE IS A SORT OF CONTRACT OF LOVE AT THE END OF IT AND PEOPLE PART WITH THEIR MONEY WHEN THAT ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TURNS UP IN YOUR INBOX OR ON YOUR PHONE OR THROUGH YOUR LETTERBOX JUST TAKE A STEP AND THINK
HE'S PROBABLY NOT REAL AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IF IT LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT'S PROBABLY A

BERNIE SANDERS JIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH WERE BERNIE SANDERS ONCE SAID I OWN MY BROTHER AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT IT WAS MY BROTHER WHO ACTUALLY INTRODUCED ME TO A LOT OF MY IDEAS THAT BROTHER LARRY SANDERS JOINS US FROM OXFORD NOW HE'S A RETIRED SOCIAL WORKER AN ACADEMIC WHO USED TO BE A GREEN PARTY COUNCILLOR GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND HERE ARE YOUR HOW'D YOUR BROTHER THEY'RE MAKING THE POINT ABOUT WHAT YOUR PARENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AND YOU WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT HE IS NOW IN THIS POSITION
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'M NOT SURPRISED I WASN'T SURE THAT IT WAS GOING TO WIN UP UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO BUT I KNOW THAT HE WOULD MAKE THEM OR YOU BLOW AND THE REASON IS THAT THE ISSUE THAT HE'S TACKLING THE GROWTH OF INEQUALITY
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONEY FROM THE BULK OF THE POPULATION FOR THE VERY RICH IS TRUE
PEOPLE FEEL THAT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS ARE THEY WERE THEY WERE WRESTLING TO THAT BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S ONE THING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE YOU KNOW HE'S FROM THE NEIGHBOURING STATE REMAND FROM NOW THOUGH IT'S A RATHER DIFFERENT GAME ISN'T IT I MEAN IN TERMS OF WHO HE WOULD NEED TO WIN OVER AND THAT IS GOING TO BE
A POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THE BUSINESS ABOUT HIM BEING FROM THE NEIGHBOURING STATE OF HIS RELIGIOUS TO HILLARY CLINTON IN SPOON HOW SHIRIN ROMANS ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY DEFINE EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF NOT BEING LIKE THE OTHER
SO THEY'RE NOT GREAT FRIENDS AND WHEN YOU STARTED THE CAMPAIGN WHEN THE BROOM THAT WAS NO FURTHER AWAY FROM THE HEALTH LYNNE'S NOWT IT WAS FORTY PER CENT BEHIND NO HE DIDN'T WIN IT BECAUSE SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR HE WANTED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE
APPROVED WHAT HE WAS SAYING SORRY GO ON NO NO FORGIVE ME BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT IS PUT FORWARD THAT ACTUALLY HE'S TOO FAR TO THE LEFT TO WIN THE COUNTRY HE COULD MAKE BABS HE COULD WIN THE NOMINATION BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY TAKING THE PRESIDENCY HE'S IN DANGER OF OF LOSING AT THE REPUBLICANS AND SETTING PROGRESSES BACK DECADES WELL THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT
IN FACT WHAT I THINK HE WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT IT WILL BE A DIFFICULT CAMPAIGN WINNING THE DENOMINATION BUT AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS IT WILL NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE
THEY'VE BEEN A PARTY OF KIND OF CONSERVATISM SHOWING SMALL STAKE DO AWAY WITH HER BENEFITS AWAY WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT HELP PEOPLE GET ON IN LIFE AND WINNER WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY AS VIGOROUS AS BIRD ARE SAYING
LOOK THAT'S YOU THAT'S YOUR YOUR PARENTS WHOSE SOCIAL SECURITY PEG A PENSION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY WILL BE WHIPPED IT'S JUST THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT YOU'VE HAD US CENTURIES TO MEAN ROTTEN ME FOR SO LONG
THE PIT THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH MURDER BUT THEY WON'T GET AWAY WITH THAT WITH BURLEY HE WILL KNOW MISTER TRUMP WHO IS THE MOST OBNOXIOUS OF THE ROOT OF THE REPUBLICANS IS A DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN I THINK PROBABLY FALLACIOUS SLEEP ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE INEQUALITY AND WHAT HE WOULD DO ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD DO ABOUT
WAS HIS PERSECUTED TO HAVE METRIC AND OWN MUSLIMS AND WHAT BERNARD WOULD DO ABOUT IT IS TO CREATE A BETTER SOCIETY I GET IT HOW WOULD HE DO THAT DO YOU IMAGINE YOUR BROTHER WALKING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE WHAT IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE TRIES TO DO THE FIRST ENGLISH BUT WHAT HE IS IS THAT HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON HIS OWN
HE'D THERE NEEDS TO BE A MOVEMENT HE CALLS IT A POLITICAL REVOLUTION I THINK IN OUR TERMS MORE LIKE YOU WOULD SAY CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WOMEN'S MOVEMENT A HUGE DEVELOPMENT OF SCUM FROM BELOW AND THAT DEMENTIA CHANGE AND THAT'S WHAT HE WILL WORK FROM THE FIRST DAY HE WILL NOT SETTLE INTO
A WOLF WHISTLE WHATEVER WHO WILL BE ON THE TELEVISION I WILL BE TRAVELLING THE COUNTRY AND HE WILL BE TALKING TO THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEM THERE AND TELLING THEM THAT IF THEY WANT TO GET WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM AND JUST BRIEFLY IN OUR TERMS SHOULD WE THINK OF HIM LIKE JEREMY CORBIN
THERE IS THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES GERMY CORBELS M.P. AUSTERITY AND I MIGHT SAY THE GREEN PARTY'S POLICIES ARE IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND THEY SPEAK TO THE SAME ISSUES BRITAIN IS NOT QUITE AS UNEQUAL AS AMERICA BUT IT'S PRETTY BIRD LARRY SANDERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

ABSOLUTELY VERY MANY HAPPY MEMORIES FROM THAT FROM THEIR STUDIO THERE AND FROM THE GROUND AND ALL THE OLD SLIMBRIDGE ALTOGETHER
WHY WERE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF OPENING IT TO THE PUBLIC WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY MAY GET BY VISITING WHAT WAS FOR MANY YEARS YOUR FAMILY HOME
I HOPE THAT BY VISITING THEY'RE GOING TO BE INSPIRED BECAUSE HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING QUITE SOMETHING MY VOTE YOU DID SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT BUT IN HIS STUDIO WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH AS YOU LEFT IT YOU CAN WALK IN AND YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THAT HE COULD WALK IN AT ANY MINUTE
AND NOTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED AND SO YOU CAN SEE HOW HE WORKED HE WAS HE'S DRAWING TABLE YOU CAN SEE HIS DESK CAN SEE HIS EASEL AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE WONDERFUL WONDERFUL VIEW THAT HE LOOKED OUT ON AND WHICH HE'D WHICH INSPIRED A LOT OF HIS PAINTINGS
AND INSPIRED YOUR ARTISTRY TOO YOU WANT OLDER RUN WELL FOR QUITE A WHILE AND SAT SORT OF PRESUME YET HIS KNEE YOU'RE AT HIS SIDE PAINTING THOSE BEAUTIFUL SWANS ABSOLUTELY I WAS UNWELL AS A TEENAGER AND SO I HAD TO STAY INSIDE YOU WON'T LIGHT OUTDOORS AND SO I NOTICED I WAS HE POINTED OUT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PATTERN OF BLACK AND YELLOW ON THE BILLS OF THESE LOVELY WILD SWANS
WHICH HE'D GOT TO COME DOWN ONTO THE POND IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THESE WERE BUICK SWANS AND HE DISCOVERED THIS DIFFERENCE
AND I REALLY COTTONED ON AND JUST LOVED DOING IT IT WAS SUCH FUN SEEING THE SAME INDIVIDUALS COME BACK EACH DAY AND AND THEN THEY WENT AWAY ON MIGRATION TO RUSSIA AND THEN THEY COME BACK AGAIN IN THE FOLLOWING WINTER AND THE SAME TEA HOW MANY CYGNETS THEY BROUGHT AN ALL WAS IT WAS GREAT FUN AND IT STILL CONTINUES TO THIS DAY SO THEY'RE STILL A STUDY OF THE BUICK SWANS
THE BUICK SWANS UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT DOING QUITE SO WELL AT THE MOMENT TO OWN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT'S CAUSING THE POPULATION DECLINED BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO GO AND SEE AND IT'S QUIZ FOR YOU HE'S FOR YOU OF OF THERE THIS ONE'S FROM THE STUDIO
I'M SORRY TO DROP WAS GOING TO SAY THERE ARE LOTS OF BIRD LOVERS WHO WILL BE APPRECIATING EVERYTHING YOU SAY SPEAK THOUGH TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T QUITE GET IT THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BUG FOR LOOKING AT BIRDS AS YOU DO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GET FROM WATCHING THOSE BIRDS WHETHER THROUGH THAT WINDOW AT SLIMBRIDGE OR ANYWHERE ELSE
WELL AS IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION IT'S A SENSE OF WONDER AND A SENSE OF JUST HOW MANY OTHER LOVELY CREATURES THERE ARE ON THE PLANET AND AND I GUESS IT'S IT FOR ME IT WAS GOOD BEING INTRODUCED TO IT WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND HOPEFULLY
YOU KNOW THE CHILDREN WHO COME TO THE DROP OFF ON WITNESS JUST ANOTHER NATURE PLACES BECOME INSPIRED BECAUSE
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS VERY WONDERFUL PUT OUT THERE AND A LOT OF US COURSE YOU LIVE IN URBAN SURROUNDINGS AND WE DON'T SEE AND THERE THERE IS SO MUCH OUT THERE IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF GOING TO SEE IT
COUPLE OF SCULPTOR SIR PETER SCOTT'S DAUGHTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THAT HOUSE JUST TO BE CLEAR AT SLIMBRIDGE NOT OPEN YET THEY'RE ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY TO DO IT SLIMBRIDGE OF COURSES AND IT'S A IT'S A GLORIOUS PLACE TO GO
IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS A TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN OXFORD STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL IN OXFORD GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SARAH TODAY IS ASH WEDNESDAY WHICH FOR CHRISTIANS AS A DAY OF FASTING AND ABSTINENCE TO MARK THE BEGINNING OF LENT
GIVE ME TIME ABSOLUTELY HOPELESS AT FASTING ARE NOT MUCH BETTER AT ABSTINENCE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN MY SMALL CORNER OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD THERE ARE NO SET RULES IF I WERE A MUSLIM I'D KEEP THE SUNRISE TO SUNSET FAST OF RAMADAN EVERYONE WILL BE DOING THE SAME AND THIS WOULD HOLD ME TO THE DISCIPLINE WITHOUT IT BEING ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL
IF I WERE ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS LENT WOULD BEGIN QUITE GENTLY NO MEAT THIS WEEK NO DAIRY NEXT AND THEN PROGRESS AND INTENSITY TO REACHING A TOTAL FAST IN HOLY WEEK AGAIN EVERYONE WILL BE DOING THE SAME
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYS NO MEAT ON FRIDAYS HUNT ON TOTAL FAST IS LIKE TODAY ONE FOR MEAL IS ALLOWED AND TWO SMALL SNACKS WHICH LEAVE SOME ROOM FOR PERSONAL IMPROVISATION
BUT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND DOESN'T REALLY PRODUCE RULES ONLY SUGGESTIONS WHICH MEANS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO FASTING AND ABSTINENCE YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT UP
SO AS MY FRIENDS AND I'VE BEEN ASKING EACH OTHER WHAT ARE YOU GIVING UP FOR LENT AND HERE I AM BREAKFAST LUSS ON ASH WEDNESDAY AND I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE
YOU SEE ONCE YOU HAVE TO MAKE UP ON YOUR OWN IT ALL BECOMES A BIT STRESSFUL SHOULD I GIVE UP ALCOHOL THIS YEAR AS I USED TO RELIGIOUSLY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES OR COFFEE WAS I DID ANOTHER YEAR TOMATO SAUCE
THAT WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IT PERMANENTLY WE'LL BE OFF A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER DELIGHTS SUCH AS SAUSAGE ROLLS AND BACON SARNIES BUT YOU CAN SEE THE WAY THIS IS GOING A MADE UP LENT IS ALL ABOUT SELF IMPROVEMENT IS NEW YEAR DIET FULL OF MUSHED UP KALE IN THE SPINACH WHICH ARE SO PENITENTIAL THAT THEY MUST BE DOING YOU GOOD
THE REWARD OF SUCH TOO GOOD REALLY IT'S A WARM GLOW OF SELF REGARD
THE LEAD THAT I REMEMBER MOST WAS WHEN I DECIDED TO WORK OUT WHY I SOMETIMES LOST MY RAG AT THINGS AND PEOPLE
I TRACED MY OCCASIONAL OUTBURSTS OF ANGER BACK TO ANXIETY TO FEELING OUT OF CONTROL IT WAS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING A SENSE OF BEING VERY SMALL AND FRAGILE BLOWN ABOUT ON THE WINDS OF FATE
IT OCCURS TO ME THAT FEELING VERY SMALL MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHERE WE ACTUALLY ARE IN THIS UNIVERSE AND IF YOU'RE A BELIEVER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD WHO DOES NOT DESPISE OUR LITTLENESS BUT HOLDS US LOVINGLY IN LIFE AND THROUGH DAY
A SELF INVENTED FAST COULD TAKE YOU IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BUT BEING SMALL HUMILITY BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE CORE OF THINGS
TO FIND NOT THE TERROR I INITIALLY FELT BUT PEACE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE INDEED JUST DUST AND TO DUST WE SHALL RETURN
IT'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH KEN AND ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD IT'S EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT GIULIO RIDGE JENNY WAS DOING RESEARCH IN EGYPT FOR HIS P.H.D. AT CAMBRIDGE WHEN HE DISAPPEARED THAT WAS ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JANUARY WHEN HIS BODY WAS FOUND LAST WEEK ACCORDING TO HER PROSECUTOR IT SHOWED CLEAR SIGNS OF TORTURE
THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY GRUESOME DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED THEY WERE MANY POLICE ON THE STREETS BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRACE SQUARE UPRISING BUT THE INTERIOR MINISTER HAS SAID RUMOURS THAT SECURITY FORCES WERE INVOLVED WERE UNACCEPTABLE AND IT WAS NOT A POLICY SALLY NABIL IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN CAIRO
HE WAS HERE IN CAIRO FOR HIS P.H.D. SEE SAYS HE WAS DOING THE RESEARCH RELATED TO TRADE UNION MOVEMENT SWITCH US BRITS A CONTENTIOUS HERE IN EGYPT COS HE HAD TO CONTACT TRADE UNION MEMBERS ACTIVISTS HALLMARKED PRO GOVERNMENT APPARENTLY
THEY'LL FOLLOW THEIR DIFFERENT FOREIGN MINISTRY ISSUED A STATEMENT JUST YESTERDAY SAYING THAT ALL ACCUSATIONS SUGGESTING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE EGYPTIAN POLICE IN THIS ISSUE OUR PREMATURE IT IS VERY EARLY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY TO THEY PROMISED THAT EGYPT WOULD BE COMMITTED TOTALLY COMPREHENSIVE IMPARTIAL EMBERS STIG ATION
ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THE ITALIANS WHO WERE PRETTY ANGRY ACTUALLY THEY SAID WE WANT ACCEPT WE WANT ACCEPT DIPLOMATIC AND SAYS WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHO THE REAL PERPETRATORS ARE THEIR INTERIOR MINISTER EVEN SAID THAT WHEN HE READ OUT THE AUTOPSY REPORT HE COULDN'T BREATHE HE SAID WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO DID THAT
THAT WAS SELLING A BEER WILL NEIL PIPER IS A FRIEND OF JULIA ARE GENIES AND HE JOINS US FROM COVENTRY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I KNOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN IN COURT YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH HIM RELATIVELY RECENTLY DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING OUT IN EGYPT AND JULIE WAS DOING DOCTORAL RESEARCH ON INDEPENDENT TRADE UNIONS SO HE HE WROTE TO ME ABOUT HIS ATTEMPTS TO GATHER DATA FOR FOR HIS RESEARCH BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN PRACTICE
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE HE WAS HE WAS CARRYING OUT INTERVIEWS AND TALKING TO TO TO PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH THE WITH THE AREA THAT HE WAS RESEARCHING DID YOU PICK UP ANY CONCERN ON HIS PART ABOUT HIS SAFETY ONE
I DIDN'T PICK UP ANY AND ANY COMMENTS EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT HIS SAFETY HE SAID TO ME THAT THAT THAT IT WAS TAKING LONGER THAN HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GATHER THE DATA THAT HE NEEDED BUT HAVING DONE A P.H.D. MYSELF I KNOW THAT THAT'S RELATIVELY THAT THAT THAT'S A RELATIVELY NORMAL PART OF THE PROCESS I DIDN'T THINK VERY MUCH ABOUT IT
WHAT WAS HE LIKE HE WAS HE HAD A VERY INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND WAS A VERY PASSIONATE PRINCIPLED SMART ARTICULATE ARTICULATE MAN VERY GOOD COMPANY VERY THEY'RE VERY GOOD TO TALK TO VERY WELL INFORMED ABOUT A LOT OF ISSUES AND A GREAT LOSS
THE ISSUES NOW OF UNIVERSITIES I MEAN HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S CARRYING OUT RESEARCH I SUPPOSE IS IT A DANGEROUS COUNTRY OR HE'S BEEN THROUGH A DIFFICULT TIMES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES ON CAMBRIDGE NOW AND I SUPPOSE OTHER UNIVERSITIES WHO WILL HAVE RESEARCHERS IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS
I THINK CLEARLY THERE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MANAGEMENT OF THE RISKS AROUND RESEARCH PARTICULARLY POLITICALLY THE RISKS AROUND RESEARCH IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE VOLATILE OR TOURIST AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL SYSTEMS OR WHETHER SOCIAL UNREST MOST UNIVERSITIES ALL UNIVERSITIES I THINK HAVE QUITE ROBUST PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING RESEARCH ETHICS AND THEY USUALLY INCLUDE RISK MANAGEMENT
I THINK CLEARLY THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT UNIVERSITIES CAN DO AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT A MESSAGE BE SENT VERT NO RESEARCHERS SHOULD FACE THIS SORT OF TREATMENT THE SORT OF FATE AND IN TERMS OF THE INVESTIGATION THERE WAS A LETTER IN THE GARDEN SIDE BY FOUR THOUSAND MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND ACADEMICS AROUND THE WORLD CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT WE
THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN THAT WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAVE I THINK THE THING THAT WILL THE THING THAT WILL HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS HE'S SUSTAINED INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE SO SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES ARE REACTING IN THE ROBUST WAY AT THEY ARE BUT THEY ARE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS STATING THAT THIS MAY BE RAISED BY IT
IN U.S. EGYPT RELATIONS AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF BRINGING THE PRESSURE TO BEAR THAT MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A FULL INVESTIGATION AND THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT NEIL PIPER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
IT'S THREE MINUTES TO EAT AND STABBED STABBED ANNOUNCES HE WILL WEAR THE MORNING STUCK GOOD MORNING TO NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL AFTER A STORMY START TO THE WEEK THE WEATHER SETTLING DOWN FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS MANY PLACES STAYING DRY WITH SOME SUNNY SPELLS APART FROM A FEW WINTRY SHOWERS BUT IT'LL ALSO BE TURNING COLDER WITH INCREASING CHANCE OF OVERNIGHT FROST ESPECIALLY INTO THE WEEKEND WITH A CHANCE OF SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN THE NORTH AND THE EAST OF THE U.K. HAVE ACTED TODAY STARTED WITH SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND IT'S RATHER CLOUDY MORN YOU'VE GOT SOME SHOWERS AROUND BUT IT'S AN IMPROVING PICTURE THROUGH THE DAY

FOUR LOOKS AT HOW A KING BELIEVED HIS WEALTH COULD BE THE KEY TO POLITICAL POWER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE SHAH OF IRAN SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS A MAJOR PLAYER AMONG WORLD LEADERS WERE ISSUING THEM A PERSONAL INVITATION HISTORICALLY AND POLITICALLY IS THE ONLY TIME WHERE EVERYONE
WHO HER CONNING HIS COUNTIES THE MONARCH IS EVERYONE WAS THERE
THIS WEEK ON THE B.B.C. STORYVILLE CHRONICLES THE STAGING OF THIS EXTRAVAGANT PARTY DID YOU SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLION WE HAVE TO ANSWER SOMEBODY ONE DAY YOUR BABY

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE TENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE TAKING STRIKE ACTION FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THEIR DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER PAY AND CONDITIONS
THEY HAVE BEEN VICTORIES FOR THE BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP AND THE LEFT WING DEMOCRAT CONTENDER BERNIE SANDERS IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE A REPORT BY THE SPENDING WATCHDOG SUGGESTS TEACHER SHORTAGES IN ENGLAND ARE GROWING
AND THE LONDON FLAT JIMI HENDRIX CALLED HIS FIRST REAL HOME IS OPENING TO THE PUBLIC
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ARE BEGINNING HER SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE IN THEIR DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER PAY AND WORKING HOURS FROM NOW MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL BE PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE ONLY MINISTERS SAY NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM REPORTS
BOTH SIDES ACKNOWLEDGE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE SINCE THE LAST WALK OUT IN JANUARY BUT ON A CRUCIAL ISSUE OF PAY FOR UNSOCIABLE HOURS THERE'S NO SIGN OF A BREAKTHROUGH
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IN THE INTERESTS OF SAFETY IT WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HOSPITALS TO ROSTER MORE DOCTORS AT WEEKENDS THE B.M.A. SAYS THAT CAN HAPPEN UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT IT WANTS TO PROTECT PREMIUM PAY RATES FOR SATURDAYS AND ARGUES THIS COULD BE FUNDED BY LIMITING THE PROPOSED INCREASE AND BASIC PAY TO BETWEEN FOUR AND SEVEN PER CENT RATHER THAN THE ELEVEN PERCENT ON OFFER
THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED THE TIME TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT IS FAST APPROACHING SOURCES SAY PLANNING FOR THIS IS ALREADY UNDERWAY THE B.M.A. SAYS THIS WOULD BE AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER SERVING ONLY TO ALIENATE DOCTORS STILL MORE FURTHER DISRUPTION LOOKS INCREASINGLY LIKELY
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARKING HEY BERING AND REDBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS MATTHEW HOPKINS SAYS HIS TRUST IN EAST LONDON HAS CANCELLED ABOUT FORTY FIVE OPERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS BUT HE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT URGENT OPERATIONS WOULD GO AHEAD AS PLANNED
MY MAIN CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT SERVICES ARE HIGH QUALITY AND SAFER PATIENTS ANY SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR CHANGES TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE DELIVER OUR OUTPATIENT OPERATIONS TO TO PATIENTS IS CLEARLY UNHELPFUL AND THAT DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGISE FOR BUT WE'VE TRIED TO MINIMISE IT AS BEST WE COULD TODAY
THE BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP AND THE LEFT WING DEMOCRAT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS HAVE WON THE BACKING OF VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE CONTEST BECOME CANDIDATES FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY HILLARY CLINTON LOST THE DEMOCRAT VOTE BY MORE THAN TWENTY POINTS AMONG THE REPUBLICANS THEY ARE HIGHER GOVERNOR JOHN CASE IT CAME SECOND LEAVING OTHER CANDIDATES VYING FOR THIRD PLACE HE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO HE'S IN THE CITY OF MANCHESTER
THESE ARE TRULY JAW DROPPING RESULTS A YEAR AGO NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT FAINTLY CONCEIVABLE THAT TO OUTSIDERS ONE FROM THE LEFT AND ONE FROM THE RIGHT WOULD CAPTURE SENSIBLE SOLID NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT THEY HAVE AND NOT BY A SQUEAK BUT BY A COUNTRY MILE DONALD TRUMP THE BILLIONAIRE PROPERTY DEVELOPER WHO'S NEVER HELD ANY ELECTED OFFICE WAS EUPHORIC AS HE ADDRESS SUPPORTERS
WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE A MARACA SO GREAT AGAIN MAY BE GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE
AND THE VICTORY OF BERNIE SANDERS IS NO LESS REMARKABLE THE SELF DESCRIBED SOCIALIST SENATOR FROM VERMONT HAS ENERGISED AND ELECTRIFIED THE DEMOCRATIC RACE WHICH WAS MEANT TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD VICTORY PROCESSION FOR HILLARY CLINTON HE PROMISED NOTHING LESS THAN A POLITICAL REVOLUTION
TONIGHT WE SERVE NOTICE TO THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COUNTRY
PEOPLE WILL NOT CONTINUE TO WORK SERVE A CAROTID CARE PAID FINALLY ANSWERS
WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE THAT AND THE BIG LOSER LAST NIGHT THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE MAINSTREAM THE DISAFFECTION OF VOTERS WITH WASHINGTON POLITICS IS PROFOUND AND THAT MEANS THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE UNKNOWABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE

THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WARNED THAT TEACHER SHORTAGES AND ENGLAND ARE GROWING AFTER RECRUITMENT TARGETS WERE MISSED FOR THE FOURTH YEAR RUNNING A REPORT BY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS MINISTERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND LOCAL PRESSURES RESULTED IN MORE SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS BEING TAUGHT BY TEACHERS WHO DON'T HAVE A DEGREE IN THE RELEVANT SUBJECT EDUCATION EDITOR RAMEN JEFFREYS HAS MORE DETAILS
NEARLY A THIRD OF PHYSICS CLASSES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND ARE BEING TAUGHT BY SOMEONE WHOSE ONLY REACHED A LEVEL STANDARD IN THAT SUBJECT IT'S ONE EXAMPLE IN THIS REPORT OF THE GROWING SIGNS OF TEACHER SHORTAGES IN SOME SUBJECTS AND SOME AREAS THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS TARGETS TO RECRUITS TO TEACHER TRAINING IN ENGLAND HAD BEEN MISSED BY AN INCREASING MARGIN IN RECENT YEARS AND IT SAYS OFFICIALS ARE TOO FOCUSED ON THE NATIONAL PICTURE
LABOUR ARGUES THIS REPORT SHOWS THE PROBLEMS ARE SERIOUS AND GROWING BUT MINISTERS SAY THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS PER PUPIL HASN'T SUFFERED AND THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TEACHER TRAINING

WELL THE FIRST THING I THINK TO SAY IS THAT NONE OF US WANT TO BE STOOD OUT HERE TODAY WE'VE GOT INTO THIS PROFESSION WE TRAINED FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS TO CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ALL OUR CAREERS
THE REASON WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE TO SPY
TO NEGOTIATIONS WE STILL DO NOT HAVE ASSURANCES THAT THE CONTRACT ON OFFER IS SAFE FOR DOCTORS AND THEREFORE SAFER PATIENTS THIS IS THEIR FOURTH YEAR AS I SAID HAVE A DISPUTE WHICH CAN SOUND COMPLICATED BUT HE'S MIGHTY SIMPLE IN TRUTH ISN'T IT
WHAT MANY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SAY WHAT MINISTERS SAY IS IF WE'RE TO BE SAFE IF THE N.H.S. IS TO BE SAFE ON A SATURDAY AND SUNDAY JUST AS IT IS THE OTHER DAYS THE WEEK YOU GUYS HAVE TO WORK ON SATURDAYS AS IF IT WAS ANY OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK IS TOUGH BUT THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE JOB
LISTEN I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE POINT ACROSS THAT WE DO ALREADY WORK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I WANNA ROTOR AT THE MOMENT WE'RE WORKING ONE WEEKEND THREE
AND WE'RE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THIS CARE THE ISSUE IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS FOR A SEVEN DAY AN H. S.
WILL STRETCH A FIVE TEN H. S. THAT ALREADY HAS HOLES IN ITS RATES ARE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY AND IT WILL MAKE THE ROTA UNSAFE FOR PATIENTS OH KAYE CHRIS HOP SIR LET ME BRING YOU IN FROM N.H.S. PROVIDE
THERE WE ARE DOCTORS SO LOOK WE ALREADY WORK HOURS AT THE WEEKEND WHAT WOULD BE BETTER WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE A PUTTING FORWARD SAY JUNIOR DOCTORS LIKE MARK PLAY AN ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN RUNNING HOSPITALS LIKE THIS ONE WE COULDN'T RUN TWINS ROMFORD WITHOUT JUNIOR DOCTORS AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE GET THE RIGHT CONTRACTS THAT ENABLES US TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN HIGH QUALITY JUNIOR DOCTORS
HOWEVER JUST LIKE ACROSS A WHOLE SWATHES OF OUR ECONOMY WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS PROVIDING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SERVICES AND JUST AS WE'VE DONE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST AS WE'VE DONE RETAIL JUST AS WE'VE DONE
IN PRISONS IN THE POLICE FORCE WE NEED TO MODERNISE THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE OTHER CONTRACTS SO THAT WE
CONTRACTS THAT ENABLE THE N.H.S. TO PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AT BUT IF THE SUM OF MONEY INVOLVED IS THE SAME OVERALL WHAT WORRIES DOCTORS WHAT WORRIES MANY PEOPLE IS THAT THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE CASH THEREFORE TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT YOU'RE TALKING OVER THE WEEKEND YOU JUST STRETCH AND ALREADY OVERSTRETCHED N.H.S. EVEN
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID AND WHAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE SAYING IS THAT THE THAT THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT WILL BE PAID TO JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL BE THE SAME NO JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL LOSE OUT IN TERMS OF BEING PAID LESS BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS MOVE TOWARDS THE SERVICE IN WHICH WE GET TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK CARE AND AS VARIOUS PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE SOME REAL RISKS IN TERMS OF HIGHER MORTALITY RATES AND IF THIS GOES ON FOR YEARS AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP
I THINK OUR MEMBERS ARE SAYING TO US THIS REALLY DOES NOW NEED TO REACH A CONCLUSION I THINK THE IDEAL CONCLUSION WOULD BE FOR EMPLOYERS TO MAKE A FAIR AND FINAL REASONABLE OFFER IF THE B.M.A. TO ACCEPT IT
IF THE B.M.A. DOESN'T ACCEPT IT I THINK OUR MEMBERS ARE SAYING TO US THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS TO FIND A WAY TO BRING THIS TO A COMPLETION SIMPLE TERMS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT N.H.S. TRUSTS YOUR MEMBERS IN OTHER WORDS ARE SAYING TO THE HEALTH SECRETARY IN POSED THIS DEAL IF YOU CAN'T GET A FINAL AGREEMENT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS FOUR YEARS LATER
THOUSAND OPERATION'S BEEN CANCELLED TODAY WE CAN'T CARRY ON LIKE THIS WE NEED TO BRING THIS TO A CONCLUSION IF THE B.M.A. WON'T ACCEPT A FAIR AND REASONABLE OFFER THEN YES IT WAS LEGITIMATE AND SENSIBLE FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CONSIDER IN POSITION THERE WE ARE MA GREGORY YOU'RE HEARING THE NOISE OF CARS HOOTING THEIR SUPPORT YOUR PICKETS ARE JOHN'S
BUT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM CHRIS HOBBS TO BE NOTICED HEALTH SECRETARY'S MIND WELL IS THERE FRANKLY GOING TO IGNORE YOU AND IMPOSED THIS ANYWAY
I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING IN SOMETHING THAT DOCTORS FEAR
WOULD LEAD TO A CONTRACT THAT WALL AS I SAY BE UNSAFE THE DOCTORS THAT WILL LEAD TO DOUG DOCTORS GETTING TIRED AND I THINK
IT WILL LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE MORALITY OF DOCTORS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT TO DROP HIM IN PRACTICE WHAT ALL THAT MEAN
I MEAN WE HEARD AT THE WEEKEND READ OUTS JEREMY
STORIES ABOUT JUNIOR DOCTORS FILLING IN TEARS NOT WANTED TO CARRY ON IN THE N.H.S. I THINK THESE DOCTORS ARE VERY WELL TRAINED
IT'S GOING TO COME TO A POINT WHERE THESE DOCTORS CAN'T GO ON WORKING IN THE N.H.S. THEY QUIT CHRIS HOBSON
IS THAT A WORRY FOR YOU THAT PEOPLE MIGHT QUIT OR IS THERE A SENSE HESITANT THEY WERE ANYBODY AWAY ZEES OF CRITICISING HEALTH SERVICE PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT FRANKLY IN OTHER WALKS OF LIFE WOULD BE REGARDED AS OUTDATED SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING I HAVE HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF VISITING A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS I WAS IN ONE LAST WEEK I WAS TALKING TO A GROUP A MIXED GROUP OF TWENTY FIVE STAFF RADIOLOGIST NURSES
A MY ASSISTANTS AND THE VIEW AROUND THE TABLE WAS IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE FOR ANY PART OF THE N.H.S. TO PUSH THEIR CASE BUT IN THE END
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES HAVE TO BE SETTLED AND THERE IS NOW A REAL SENSE THAT THIS HAS GONE ON TOO LONG AND THAT WE DO NEED TO BRING IT TO A CONCLUSION ARE THEY ASKING FOR MONEY ARE THEY ASKING FOR CONDITIONS THAT YOU WOULDN'T GET IN OTHER WALKS OF LIFE
IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE EVERY OTHER AREA OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE WHERE YOU HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SERVICES THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD TREAT SATURDAY
MOST OF THE DAY OF SATURDAY DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER DAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE CASE TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE THINGS THEY SAY JUST AS EVERYONE OTHER PART OF THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED IT'S TIME TO GET TO TRUST YOURSELVES THAT MARGARET SORRY SAY IT TO A SHOP WORKER THAT YOU SHOULD GET THESE MASSIVE EXTRA PAYMENTS ON A SATURDAY AND THEY
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NICK LOTS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY NURSES PARAMEDICS SHOP WORKERS WORK INCREDIBLY HARD ON THE WEEKENDS JUST TO STOP TO STAY
WORRIED THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE N.H.S. WOULD BECOME STRETCHED TRYING TO PROVIDE A SEVEN DAY CARE
OVERALL A FIVE DAY WORKING WEEK WILL HAVE SALTS HAVE HOLES IN THE ROTA AND IT'LL BECOME MORE UNSAFE FOR DOCTORS MORE AND SAY FOR PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE OUT HERE TODAY
THIS CONTRACT IS SIMPLY NOT FAIR FOR PATIENTS NOBODY EVER WANTS TO SAY IT TO DOCTORS BUT I'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU
ISN'T THERE A DANGER THERE PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ARE BEYOND ALL THOSE CONCERNS IS HE BEING A BIT
I THINK THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL
THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT PROVIDING A CONTRACT FOR DOTS AS THEY CAN
FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO INTO WORK SAFE THEY'RE NOT OVERWORKED BUT THEY HAVE A SAFE WORK LIFE BALANCE
IT'S BEEN SET A LONG THIS CONTRACT IS COSTLY TRIAL WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR MORE MONEY
WE'RE ASKING FOR A SAFE CONTRACT FOR US MARK GREGORY CHRIS WATSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED YOU'RE HEARING THAT PICKET LINE YOU'VE NO DOUBT HEAR THEM IF THEY CAN STAND THE COLD SARAH FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS HEARING THE OCCASIONAL HONK OF HALLWAYS AS WELL AS PEOPLE PASSING BY OFFER THEIR SUPPORT WE WOULD OF COURSE HAVE LIKE TO TALK TO THE HEALTH SECRETARY HIMSELF JEREMY UP THIS MORNING BUT SADLY WAS WASN'T AVAILABLE I THINK WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM LATER IN THE DAY AS THIS STRIKE PROCEED
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE BIGGEST BANK IN EUROPE'S STRONGEST ECONOMY HAS BEEN TRYING TO REASSURE INVESTORS THAT HE'S NOT IN TROUBLE GERMANY'S DEUTSCHE BANK A SEEN IT SHARES SLIDE FORTY PERCENT SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR THEY HAVE BOUNCED BACK TINY AMOUNT THAT THIS MORNING BUT IT'S LEAD PEOPLE TO WORRY NOT NOT ONLY ABOUT OTHER BANKS ACROSS THE SECTOR BUT ALSO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE UNDERLYING AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMY
AROUND THE WORLD THE FINANCIAL ANALYST AND LOUISE COOPER JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH DEUTSCHE BANK FIRST OF ALL OUT HOW DEEP ARE THE BANKS PROBLEMS DO YOU THINK
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL I'M IN THE SHARE PRICE THIS MORNING'S UP FOUR PERCENT ON A ON A RUMOUR THEY MAY DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BOOST THEIR ACCOUNTING PROFITS AND EVERYONE'S TAKING THAT POSITIVELY I WOULD REGARD IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE NEGATIVE THEY HAVE TO MUCK AROUND WITH THEIR ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO CREATE A PROFIT A BIT A LITTLE BIT OF A BOUNCE BACK BUT AS YOU SAID IT'S DOWN FORTY PERCENT YOU TO DATE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN BANKING INDEX IT'S FALLEN ELEVEN PER CENT SO STOCKS IN EUROPE'S BANKS ARE DOWN ELEVEN PERCENT IN JUST MONDAY AND TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK SO
THE CONCERN IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST DEUTSCHE IT'S A BIGGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF DEUTSCHE THEY HAD RESULTS LAST WEEK AND THEY MANAGED TO LOSE ALMOST SEVEN BILLION EURO LAST YEAR AND THEY TOOK OFF AND TOOK RIGHT OFF SO THESE ONE OFF COSTS FOR FINES MISBEHAVING LOANS BLAH DI BLAH OF TWELVE BILLION EURO
EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE LARGEST BANK IN GERMANY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO WRITE OFF TWELVE BILLION OF YOUR CAPITAL THAT OFTEN AND WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK AS THEY WERE ASKED ABOUT A PARTICULAR BOND THOSE THERE COULD YOU PAY BACK YOUR INTEREST AND THE FINANCE DIRECTOR DIDN'T CATEGORICALLY SAY ABSOLUTELY YES THEY SINCE COME OUT OF THAT YES WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OUT TO PAY THE INTEREST ON THIS DEBT BUT IF YOU'RE A BANK EVEN THE QUESTION
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE IN A STRONG ENOUGH POSITION TO PAY YOUR INTEREST ON YOUR DEBT MEANS THAT THE WORLD GOES INTO CHAOS WHICH WAS WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON DEUTSCHE BANK AND IT'S MADE WORSE BECAUSE SOME JANUARY THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR THERE'S NEW RULES ON BANKS
WHICH MEANS THAT BOND HOLDERS OR CREDITORS TO BANKS HAVE TO TAKE A LOSS IF THE BANK GOES BUST COS CALLS IN THE GLORY DAYS OF FINANCIAL CRISIS IT WAS TAXPAYERS THAT'S DEAD STOOD UP WHEN WHEN BANKS WENT BUST NOW IT'S THOSE THAT LEND ITS MONEY AND THEREFORE IT'S CAUSED ALL THESE INVESTORS TO THINK MUCH MORE CLOSELY ABOUT WHEN A BANK MAY GO BUST BUT WE MUST HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHETHER THIS IS DEUTSCHE BANK JUST MAKING SOME TOUGH DECISIONS OR WHETHER THEY ARE JUST EFFECTIVELY WITH THE SAME SITUATION AS EVERY OTHER
CREDIT SWISS CAME UP WITH SOME RESULTS AND ITS SHARE PRICE FELL SOMETHING LIKE TEN PER CENT ON THE DAY OF THE NUMBERS AND OF COURSE REMEMBER WE'VE GOT A U.K. BANK EARNING SEASON COMING UP I THINK WE'VE GOT H.S.B.C. IS THE FIRST ON TWENTY SECOND OF FEBRUARY AND ALL THE OTHERS FOLLOW AFTERWARDS BARCLAYS LLOYDS SO THEY ALL SORT OF END OF FEBRUARY BARCLAYS ENDS ON THE FIRST OF MARCH
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY ANOTHER THING YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT JANET YELLAND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS DOING HER SEMI ANNUAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS TODAY AND TOMORROW WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WOULD BE VERY CLOSELY WATCHED BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE OR INVESTORS AND BANKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND WE DON'T QUITE THINK
GLOBAL BANKS ARE IN A STRONG ENOUGH POSITION TO COPE WITH THE THIRD LEG OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMING LOUISE COOPER THANKS VERY MUCH
TWENTY TWO SHOULD THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT AND ANALYSE ALL OF OUR OWN SOMETIMES PERSONAL DATA TO FIND CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES AT THE HEART OF THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS
THE DRAFT BILL IS BEING SCRUTINISED BY A JOINT PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE THE REPORT'S TOMORROW SO I'LL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON KARA HAS BEEN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ISSUES TODAY THE WORLD A BIG DATA
WE START THE EXHIBITION JUST BY TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT BIG DATA IS AND JUST FOR EXAMPLE NINETY PER CENT
OF THE DATA THAT'S BEEN PRODUCED IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF HUMANITY WAS PRODUCED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS
CATALYST THE DIRECTOR OF EXHIBITIONS AT SOMERSET HOUSE WHERE THE BIG BANG DATA EXHIBITION EXPLORES HOW ALL THE DATA WE PRODUCE CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN TRACK US ONE OF THE INTERESTING ARTWORKS IN THE EXHIBITION IS BY AN ARTIST CALLED OH MONDAY
CALLED I KNOW WHERE YOUR CAT LIVES HE CAN TAKE THIS INFORMATION FROM IMAGES POSTED IF YOUR CAT AND PINPOINT EXACTLY WHERE YOU LIVE
BUT THE MESSAGE IS QUITE FRIGHTENING SO EVERYTHING YOU POST WHETHER IT'S AN INSTAGRAM IMAGE OR A TWITTER FEED HAS ALL THIS DATA EMBEDDED IN IT WHICH CAN BE
MAKES OF US NOW GENERATES DATA ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE AND ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IN THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL IS HOW FAR THE STATE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY SECRET UP TO NOW IT WAS ONLY WHEN RELEASING THE DRAFT BILL THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT M.I.FIVE HAD FOR A DECADE BEEN SECRETLY COLLECTING ALL BRITISH PHONE RECORDS IN BULK THAT SECRECY IS WHAT WORRIES ERIC KING OF THE CAMPAIGN GROUP DON'T SPY ON US THE SECURITY SERVICES FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HAD
IN BULK THE PHONE RECORDS OF EVERY PERSON YOU CALLED HOW OFTEN YOU CALL THEM WHEN YOU CALL THEM THEY WERE DATA MINING IT AT SCALE WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WAS TO USE BECAUSE IT WASN'T BEING FORMALLY OVERSEEN BY ANY OVERSIGHT BODY IS REMARKABLE AS THAT SOUNDS IT IS TRUTH DATA SETS USED BY GOVERNMENT CAN BE MUCH MORE THAN PHONE RECORDS IT COULD BE TRAVEL RECORDS OR GOVERNMENT DATABASES
THE IDEA BEHIND THE NEW BILL IS THAT THE POWERS OVER BULK DATA WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME BE TRANSPARENT AND THEY'LL BE STRICTER AUTHORISATIONS AND OVERSIGHT
ENSURING THE STATE CAN ACCESS SUCH DATA IS VITAL ARGUE SIR DAVID OME AND A FORMER DIRECTOR OF G.C.H.Q. ALTHOUGH WITH LIMITS HE SAYS I'LL SPORT DATABASES VEHICLE LICENSING DATABASES THIS CAN ALL BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION
THE SAFEGUARDS WILL BUT I KNOW WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WHEN THE CODES OF PRACTICE ARE WRITTEN THEY DO SPELL
WHERE THE LINE IS WHEN YOU WOULD SAY NO THAT'S TOO PERSONAL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP THAT HELP MEDICAL HEALTH RECORDS FOR EXAMPLE AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE SUGGEST THAT THOSE WOULD BE
INSIDE THIS KIND OF SCHEME WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT BOLT DATA IS THAT MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS FROM ORDINARY INNOCENT PEOPLE SO OF THE PROPOSED CONTROLLED STRONG ENOUGH
DOMINIC GRIEVE IS CHAIR OF THE PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY COMMITTEE WHICH YESTERDAY REPORTED ITS CONCERNS OVER THE LACK OF CLEAR PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THIS CAN BE OF INESTIMABLE VALUE IN IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS AND BEING ABLE TO SHOW WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR WHAT THEY'RE UP TO
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS WHICH PROVIDES A REASSURANCE THAT IN FACT THE ACCESS TO THIS MATERIAL INFORMATION IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THE PUBLIC WITH REASSURANCE THAT IN FACT THEIR OWN DATA WHICH MIGHT BE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO BE LOOKED AT
IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE BUT ALSO COMPANIES THAT ARE USING OUR DATA AND BACK AT SOMERSET HOUSE CLAIRE CATTRELL SAYS THE BIG BANG DATA EXHIBITION RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH IT ALL
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY'VE SEEN AND THEY DON'T REALLY REALISE
HOW MUCH DATA'S BEEN PRODUCED ALL OR HOW IT'S BEING USED ALL WHITES
AND THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT THAT WAS GORDON CARRARA REPORTING THERE FROM SOMERSET HOUSE AND THE EXHIBITION LET'S GET SOME SPORTS NEWS ROB WANTED
THEY SAY HE'S HELLO AGAIN THE LAST F.A. CUP TIE AT UPTON PARK BEFORE WEST HER MOVE TO THE OLYMPIC STADIUM WAS QUITE AN OCCASION TO AND FRO FOR THE FIRST NINETY MINUTES AGAINST LIVERPOOL ONE OR GOING INTO EXTRA TIME BUT THEN WITH A PENALTY SHOOT OUT JUST SECONDS AWAY WEST HAM DEFENDER ANGELO UNBORN ARE HEADED IN HIS FIRST GOAL FOR THE CLUB AND HISTORICAL HIGHLIGHT ACCORDING TO WEST HAM MANAGER SLUM VILLAGE
I THINK THIS GAME'S GOING TO GO IN A HISTORY OF YOUR QUEST CAME WITH ONE OF THE BEST GAME SORT BIGGEST KNIFE BECAUSE THIS WAS THEIR FATE WAS FLAVOUR KICK OFF BECAUSE AGAINST LIVERPOOL IT IS THE LAST FEW YEARS
THAT DOG BARK AND IF YOU'RE THAT WE SCORED LIKE IN THE LAST MINUTE OF THE GAME WE ARE WORKING EVERY KEEP AGAIN WE DESERVE TO WIN THIS GAME
MEANWHILE BILL KEN WRIGHT THE OWNER OF OPALS NEIGHBOURS EVERTON IS BELIEVED TO BE MOVING CLOSER TO A TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUND TAKEOVER AFTER TALKS WITH AN AMERICAN CONSORTIUM HEADED BY JOHN J. MORT THE FORMER OWNER OF THE BASEBALL TEAM SAN DIEGO PADRES CRUCIALLY MAYBE THIS WOULD BRING THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN OWNERS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TO FOURTEEN ENOUGH IF THEY WERE TO CLUB TOGETHER TO PUSH THROUGH FUNDAMENTAL RULE CHANGES ON A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY AND THIS RAISES THE PROSPECT OF DOING AWAY WITH RELEGATION
AN IDEA SOME OF THEM RAISED UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR YEARS AGO WERE CIARAN MAGUIRE IS A FOOTBALL FINANCE EXPERT FROM LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY CLEAR AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU GO ON ROB HERE ASKING YOU ARE PREMIER LEAGUE OWNERS MIGHT VOTE AGAINST RELEGATION IS RATHER LIKE ASKING WHY TURKEYS MIGHT VOTE AGAINST CHRISTMAS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY WILL ALL DO IT
I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY IN THEIR INTEREST FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING MOORS AND NOEL TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ON BUYING EVERTON AND THEN THEY'D HAVE TO INVEST ON THE GROUND ON THE GROUND TO THE STADIUM AS WELL THEN THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT BECAUSE THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IS A FINANCIAL RATHER THAN THE EMOTIONAL AND LOVING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE AS FANS HAVE WITH THE CLUBS
SO WHAT VET THEIR CONCERN IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INCOME FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS NOW GENERATED THROUGH TELEVISION AND THEY'D THE PROSPECTS OF BEING RELEGATED TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP WHERE YOU'RE LIKELY TO ONLY GET FIVE OR SIX MILLION POUNDS A YEAR FROM T. V. RIGHTS COMPARED TO THE MINIMUM ONE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES NO SENSE FROM A FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW YES AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT AMERICAN OWNERS LIVERPOOL AT VILLA AT MANCHESTER UNITED WELL THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR FINANCIAL SECURITY OFFERED BY SPORT WITHOUT RELEGATION
EXACTLY AND CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF SELLING CLUBS AT PRESENT WEST BROMWICH ALBION AND ASTON VILLA ARE RUMOURED TO BE UP FOR SALE BUT NOBODY'S PREPARED TO TOUCH FILLER WITH WITH THE PROSPECT OF RELEGATION SO THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT UPON THE PRICE WHICH THEY THE OWNERS CAN RECOUP FROM THE CLUB SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR MONEY IS AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE PREMIER LEAGUE SPOKESMAN DAN JOHNSON HAS ALREADY BEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING IT'S A NON RUNNER HE SAYS PROMOTION AND RELEGATION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE LEAGUE'S APPEAL AND INTEGRITY
I AGREE WITH THAT FROM FROM A FAN'S POINT OF VIEW IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE T. V. VIEWING FIGURES THE THE PHANTOM ESPECIALLY THE THE OVERSEAS FANS REMEMBER THAT AT THE FOREIGN T.V. RIGHTS NOW CONSTITUTE AROUND ABOUT THREE BILLION POUNDS OF THE THREE YEAR DEAL THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WATCHING NORWICH VERSES BOURNEMOUTH OR CRYSTAL PALACE URSI SUNDERLAND IT'S ONLY THE LIKES OF CHELSEA AND MANCHESTER UNITED AND SO ON
AND I THINK WHAT MIGHT BE A GAME CHANGER IS THAT WITH THE CHELSEA FLIRTING WITH RELEGATION EARLIER THIS SEASON IT WAS QUITE A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT FOR ROMAN ABRAMOVICH TO HAVE TO SOME SOMEHOW REALISED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FUND A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION POUND WAGE BILL FROM FROM T.B. RECEIPTS WHICH ARE A FRACTION OF THE PREVIOUS AMOUNTS CIARAN MCGUIRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT OF COURSE TO THE SUPER HIGHFLYING CANARIES TODAY'S REST HITTING A COLOURLESS SURVIVE EARLY MORNING INSPECTION AND GOES AHEAD NOT QUITE SO SUPER HIGH FLYING AT THE MOMENT

TYPICAL WHEN GOING TO JUST AFTER AFTERMATH THANKS VERY MUCH LIVING OTHER WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE MAINLY DRY THERE WILL BE AN ODD SHOWER THE JUST THE ODD SHOWER IN SOME PLACES
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND NICK ROBINSON TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE NOW AND TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CAROLINE NICHOLS JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAVE BEGUN A SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE IN THEIR DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER PAY AND WORKING HOURS UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK TOMORROW MORNING MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE ONLY MINISTERS SAY NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED

A FORMER LONDON HOME OF JIMI HENDRIX OPENS TO THE PUBLIC TODAY ALMOST TWO AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN SPENT RESTORING THE FLAT IN MAYFAIR TO THE WAY IT LOOKED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN THE ROCK GUITARIST LIFT
IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TIME THE INTERNATIONAL TENNIS FEDERATION HAS ADMITTED THAT TO UMPIRES WERE BANNED FROM THE SPORT LAST YEAR AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN A BETTING SCAM WE ONLY KNOW BECAUSE THE GUARDIAN UNCOVERED THE STORY IT FOLLOWS THE NEWS OF MAX MATCH FIXING AT THE TOP OF THE GAME THE CAME OUT AT LAST MONTH'S AUSTRALIAN OPEN DAN DOBSON WAS ARRESTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FOR ACCORDING TO AUSTRALIAN POLICE TRYING TO CORRUPT THE OUTCOME OF A MATCH IN A DOCUMENTARY FOR RADIO FOUR LAST YEAR HE EXPLAINED HOW THE PRACTICE OF SO CALLED COURT SIDING WORKS
GUARDS CAUGHT MID DAY AND YOU'LL BE TOLD WHERE TO GO HE'S GOING TO COURT AND WON FOR EXAMPLE YOU DON'T SIT ON COURT FOR AS LONG AS WE NEEDED SIT THERE PRESSING THE BUTTONS SENTENCE MY TROUSERS
THE SCORES BACK TO LONDON'S HIT AT THEIR PRESS ONE FOR DJOKOVIC TOO FOR MURRAY IT'S FOSTER YOU COULD SLIP AND YOU COULD BE ANY OF THE COMPETITION AND THEN THEIR SCORES BACK TO THE GUYS IN LONDON I WAS DOWN DOBSON WHAT DOCTOR BEN VAN RUN POINTS PROFESSOR IS A PROFESSOR OF COMPETITION POLICY AND MEDIA REGULARLY JOINS US FROM THE HAGUE AND WE'RE JOINED FROM CAMERA BY RICHARD INGS WHO USED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL UMPIRE HE WAS ALSO A SENIOR EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBLE FOR UMPIRES AT THE ASSOCIATION OF TENNIS TENNIS PROFESSIONALS AND HELLO TO YOU BOTH
MORNING DOCTOR VON RUMP OI THIS STICK THIS THING THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THEIR COURT SIDING IT'S NOT ILLEGAL IS IT
NO IT'S NOT AN OFFENCE ALTHOUGH IT IS IN BREACH OF DISCIPLINE THEIR REGULATIONS OF THE TENNIS FEDERATION BUT IT'S ONLY A DISCIPLINARY OFFENCE AND WE HEARD THEY'RE FROM DAN DOBSON HOW HE WOULD TRY TO GET THESE RESULTS PRESUMABLY BACK TO BOOKMAKERS QUICKER THAN ANYBODY ELSE WAS HEARING THEM BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECOND SO WHAT ADVANTAGE DOES THAT GET
WELL USUALLY FOR THE MORE HIGH LEVEL TOURNAMENTS YOU WOULDN'T GET ANY MUCH MORE ADVANTAGE NOWADAYS BECAUSE BETTING OPERATORS ARE AWARE OF THIS COURT SIGNING PRACTICE SO THEY WOULD DELAY ACCEPTING THE BETS WITH ONE OR TWO SECONDS ALSO A.T.P. WORLD TOUR WAS THE HIGH LEVEL EVENTS THEY WOULD HAVE MORE DATA COLLECTOR STAYED STATUS SCOUTS IN THE STADIUM
TRANSMITTING THE DONE SO YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CROSS CHECK DATA AND THESE THINGS WOULDN'T HAPPEN IT'S ALL IN THIS LOWER TOURNAMENTS LIKE THE FUTURE TOURNAMENTS WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE DAY A SOURCE
IF THAT DATE AS FAR AS IN THIS CASE THE UMPIRE DEM DELAYS TRANSMITTING THE STATISTICS THEN OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT ADVANTAGE OH KAY AND WE TALK BUT WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT A FEW SECONDS
YES BUT IN THIS CASE THERE'S ALLEGATIONS FOR UMPIRES UNDER INVESTIGATION THAT DELAY TO TRANSMITTING THE OUTCOME OF A SET FOR INSTANCE UP TO SIXTY SECONDS SO THAT DOES GIVE YOU A GRIP A GOOD HEAD START RICHARD THINGS HAD YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE FROM PEOPLE THAT YOU WORKED WITH
OH LOOK AT THAT THE PRACTICE OF COURTSIDE IT HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS BUT WHERE THIS IS UNIQUE IS TO HAVE ACTUAL MATCH COURT OFFICIALS ACTUAL CHAIR UMPIRES ACCEPTING MONEY FROM BOOKMAKERS TO BE INVOLVED IN COURT SO I DIDN'T DIRECTLY FROM THE UMPIRE'S CHAIR
AND YOU HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE NO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED FOR THE UMPIRE'S INVOLVED IT'S A VERY EGREGIOUS BREACH OF EDDIE CORRUPTION RULE SEND WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF BABIES OFFICIALS
WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN LIFE ENDS IN THE BALANCE AROUND SUSPENSION PENDING INVESTIGATION BUT YOU SAY WE'VE SEEN WE'VE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE GUARDIAN HAS FORCED THE THIS TO GO PUBLIC FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TENNIS FEDERATION AND THERE'S TWO THAT I'M ENTERING IN THERE'S APPARENTLY ANOTHER FOUR WHO ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION ON CHARGES ARE SERIOUS CORRUPTION
OH THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ASPECT OF THIS MATTER WHEN A PLAYER IS INVOLVED IN BREAKING ANTI CORRUPTION RULES THEY ALWAYS PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED EVEN IF THEY RANK NUMBER TWO THOUSAND IN THE WORLD AND IF IT'S A RELATIVELY MINOR OFFENCE HERE WE HAD SEVERAL CHAIR UMPIRES INVOLVED IN EQUALLY SERIOUS CORRUPTION ACTIVITIES WHICH WERE NOT PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC IT WAS WRONG OF THE INTERNATIONAL TENNIS FEDERATION AND AGAINST ITS RULES NOT TO MAKE IT PUBLIC
WELL IT'S INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT AND IF THE TENNIS FEDERATION IS WILLING AND ABLE TO ANNOUNCE A TENNIS PLAYER RANKED TWO THOUSAND IN THE WORLD FOR PLACING A FEW DOLLARS BITS ON ON A MATCH AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT SUSPENSION THEN THE FACT THAT MORE SERIOUS OFFENCE OF OFFICIALS UMPIRES IN THE CHAIR TAKING BRIBES AND COURTSIDE ING DIRECTLY FROM THE UMPIRE'S CHAIR THAT MUST BE
ANNOUNCED DOCTOR BEN ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU WANTED TO STOP THIS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WOULD BE TO GO PUBLIC WHEN SOMEBODY'S GONE SOMETHING DONE SOMETHING WRONG
ABSOLUTELY I FULLY AGREE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS ABOUT THE STENT HAS INTEGRITY UNIT THE OPERATOR SECRETIVELY AS THE M.I.FIVE M. IT HAS A BIG DE TURNED FUNCTION TO ANNOUNCES SANCTIONS TO GIVE THE SIGNAL LOOK WE'RE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING INTO THIS IMPOSING SANCTIONS SO YOU BETTER DING FOURTH TWICE BEFORE DOING THIS SO THAT IS INDEED THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FACT HOW WIDESPREAD DO YOU THINK THIS SORT OF THING IT
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO PROOF FOR ANY TYPE OF CORRUPTION LATER IT'S MATCH FIXING OR THIS DISCIPLE OF CORRUPTION SO THAT IS THAT IS INDEED DIFFICULT BUT ONCE YOU DO GET THE PUB THE PUZZLE PIECES TOGETHER THEY YOU SHOULD PUBLICALLY ANNOUNCE ANDY TURNER AND SHOWED HER THEIR SANCTIONS BEING IMPOSED RICHARD EXIT MUST MAKE THIS WILL MAKE MANY PEOPLE WONDER HOW WIDESPREAD IS IT
WELL I MEAN TENNIS IS A MASSIVE SPORT THIS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL TENNIS MATCH PLAYED EVERY YEAR THERE'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PROFICIENTLY RANK PLAYERS HAS PLAYED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES THERE'S MULTIPLE TOURNAMENTS IN ANY GIVEN AWAY COME A RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IT'S A MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN GETTING UP TO WRONGDOING THROUGH COURTSIDE IN THREE MATCH FIXING THROUGH THROUGH A GAMBLING ON THE SPORT IT'S IT'S A REAL RISK FOR PROFESSIONAL TENNIS RICHARD INGS AND DOCTOR BEN VON RUMP OI THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A STARK WARNING TO INVESTORS ABOUT PEER TO PEER LENDING SUMMER JACK BACK AND HE CAN TELL US MORE THANKS NICK YES PEER TO PEER LENDING IS GROWING RAPIDLY MATCHES PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES WHO NEED CASH WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVE SOME SPARE AND WANT A BETTER RETURN NEARLY FIVE BILLION POUNDS HAS BEEN LENT SO FAR THIS WAY BUT THIS IS WHAT ADAIR TURNER THE FORMER HEAD OF U.K. FINANCIAL REGULATION TOLD ME
I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT THE LOSSES ON PEER TO PEER LENDING WHICH WILL EMERGE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL MAKE THE WORST BANKERS LOOK LIKE ABSOLUTE LENDING GENIUSES YOU CANNOT LEND
TO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN PARTICULAR WITHOUT SOMEBODY GOING AND DOING GOOD CREDIT UNDERWRITING THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN JUST AUTOMATE THAT ONTO A PLATFORM I THINK IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY BUT I THINK IT WILL END UP PRODUCING BIG LOSSES WILL CHRISTINE FARNUS IS CHAIR OF THE PEER TO PEER FINANCE ASSOCIATION
PRETTY STRONG STUFF THAT RESPOND YES SURPRISING STATEMENT REALLY FROM ADAIR WHO NORMALLY IS REALLY AN EVIDENCE BASED PERSON AND VERY ANALYTICAL I I FEEL THAT WHAT IS SAID ABOUT PEER TO PEER LANDING JUST FLIES IN THE FACE OF THE FACTS PEER TO PEER LENDERS DON'T JUST LEARN TO ANYONE WITHOUT ANY CREDIT RISK UNDERWRITING THOUGH TAKE CREDIT RISK UNDERWRITING EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME INFORMATION
AT HAND AND DO THE SAME SORT OF ANALYSIS THAT THE BANKS DO IF NOT MORE CAN THAT BE POSSIBLE WHEN YOU'RE AUTOMATING SOMETHING WITH IN THE SPLITS AT HIGH SPEED TO THE WAY THIS DOES WITHOUT CUTTING SOME OF THE CORNERS WERE A BANK WOULD GO DOWN TO A BUSINESS AND SAY HOW LONG'S YOUR LEASE HOW OLD IS THIS MACHINE THAT YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR OVERHEADS THAT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN EVER AN INSET PLATFORM
WHY CAN'T IT AND HOW DO YOU THINK THE BANKS WORK DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THE BANKS HAVE ARMIES OF PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS PREMISES EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE THEY OFFER OVERDRAFT OF COURSE THEY DON'T FIT THEIR PLATFORMS LOOK AT TWO YEARS' WORTH AT LEAST OF AUDITED MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS THEY LOOK AT THEIR BUSINESS ANALYTICS THEY HAVE VERY SOPHISTICATED ANALYTICAL SOFTWARE
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND CREDIT REFERENCE DATA THEY USE EXACTLY THE SAME CREDIT REFERENCE DATA THAT THE BANKS YEARS THE BAND INVESTORS THEY PHONED THEIR CUSTOMERS UP TO CHECK THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING REALLY IS THE CASE IF THE BANKS DO THIS FOR A LIVING THEY LEND MONEY OR SOME OF THE COMPANIES IN THIS IN THIS AREA HAVE ADVERTS ON BUS STOPS ON THE TUBE SAYING PUT YOUR MONEY INTO THESE PLATFORMS IS THAT APPROPRIATE
WHY ISN'T IT I MEAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SORT OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ORDINARY MASS MARKET CONSUMERS HAVE HAD TO DO THINGS WITH THEIR MONEY WHETHER IT'S SAVING OR INVESTING OVER THE OVER THE YEARS THE CHOICES ARE GENERALLY PUT YOUR MONEY WITH A BANK IN WHICH CASE YOU'LL GET ROTTEN RETURNS AND YOU'LL PROBABLY BE SOLD A WHOLE LOAD OF DODGY PRODUCTS OR PUT IT WITH THE INVESTMENTS AND THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY OR THE PENSIONS INDUSTRY AND GET COPPED BY LOTS OF
HIDDEN CHARGES FEES ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T REALISE ARE GOING ON ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE HORRENDOUSLY COMPLICATED PEER TO PEER LENDING OFFERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY CLEAR UNDERSTANDABLE TO ORDINARY FOLK THAT SPELLS OUT THE RISKS AND THE REWARD SO PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION CHRISTINE VARNISH CHAIR OF THE PEER TO PEER FILE SESSION VERY THANKS THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE

SO POST PARTITION INDIA I THINK DOCTOR CAN DEBBIE WILL AGREE IT'S BEEN A KIND OF UNEASY MARRIAGE BETWEEN TWO VERY DIFFERENT TRADITIONS ONE WAS THE ATTRITION OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS THE AMAZING PEOPLE LIKE BE A UNPAIRED COURBET PILLAR BY PATEL NEHRU GANDHI WHO OPEN SECULAR PLURALIST AND TOLERANT AND THE OTHER WAS A SLIGHTLY NASTY A STRAIN OF KIND OF HINDU NATIONALISM WHICH HAS EXPRESSION IN THE B. J. P. PARTY WHICH IS WHAT THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER LEADS AND A MOVEMENT CALLED SHIFTS
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BOOK WITH THE MOST LAST SIGH AND HE HAD THIS WONDERFUL LINE WE SAID THOSE WHO HATED INDIA THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO RUIN IT WOULD NEED TO RUIN BOMBAY AND IN THE SAME YEAR SHIFT SENNA FORCIBLY PUSH THROUGH THE RENAMING OF BOMBAY AGAINST THE WILL OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IT'S BEEN WHICH IS SHORT FOR MUM AND BABY HAD BEEN USED QUITE A LOT BY PEOPLE IN THE CITY IS DOCTOR GIVE DAMPHOUSSE
I THINK THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF BOMBAY'S OF AN OPEN COSMOPOLITAN PORT CITY THE GATEWAY OF INDIA THAT'S OPEN TO THE WORLD AND IF YOU CALL IT WHAT HINDU NATIONALIST WANT YOU TO CALL IT YOU ACTUALLY DO THEIR WORK FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT IT IS JOURNALISTS IS SOMEONE WHO EDITS INDEPENDENCE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BE SPECIFIC ABOUT OUR TERMINOLOGY AND I'D RATHER SIDE WITH THE TRADITION OF THE NEED IT'S BEEN OPEN TO THE WORLD RATHER THAN ONE THAT'S BEEN CLOSED WHICH IS IN ASCENDANCE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU DOCTOR BUT I'M GOOD WHAT DO YOU CALL IT
WELL I TEND TO CALL IT BY DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHICH A LANGUAGE I'M SPEAKING IN ENGLISH CONTEXT I MEAN IF YOU IF I'M SPEAKING IN MY NIGHTIE I WOULD SAY MUMBAI IF I'M SPEAKING IN ENGLISH SOMETIMES I WOULD SAY BOMBAY AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD BE MUMBAI AND SOMETIMES IF I'M SPEAKING COULD BE BUM A BIT OTT BUT I COULD SEE THIS COMING FROM BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THEM BY BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AT THE TERM BOMBAY HAS A CERTAIN EMOTIONAL RESONANCE AND I CAN SEE THAT HE'S COMING FROM ON THIS
BUT BUT THERE'S A BUT THERE YOU ARE YES I THINK I AM
WELL I THINK THERE'S A DANGER HERE OF FLATTENING OUT AN ORDER COMPLEX STORY BECAUSE I THINK THE HISTORIES OF BOMBAY OR MUMBAI AT MUTUALLY IMPLICATED AND I THINK ONE HAS TO BE VERY ALERT TO THE POLITICS OF NAMING AND OFF FLAT AS I SAID WHAT IS QUITE A COMPLEX STORY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES OUT TINK RAISED BY THE STANCE THAT MOURNERS STEAK AND WHICH I THINK ARE QUITE INTERESTING FROM A HISTORIAN'S POINT OF VIEW
BUT DOCTOR YOU'D AGREE WITH ME WHEN YOU DO IT IN SHIFTS YOU HAVE A STRAIN OF INDIAN THOUGHT WHICH DOESN'T REALLY SIT COMFORTABLY WITH THE TRADITION IN THE CITY WHICH YOU GREW UP IN WHICH
ELOQUENTLY CHRONICLED IN YOUR ACADEMIC WORK WHEN YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT AS WELL THERE'S A KIND OF THERE'S A STRAIN OR A KIND OF FEELING ABROAD IN INDIA AT THE MOMENT ARE REALLY NASTY STRANGE CENSORSHIP WHICH HASN'T BEEN CAUSED BY THE ELECTION OF MODI BUT WHICH IS CERTAINLY COINCIDED WITH IMRAN KHAN THE M.P. ACTOR NOT THE POLITICIANS ARE JUST THIS WEEK THAT CENSORSHIP IN INDIA HAD REACHED NEW LEVELS THEY THINK IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE RIGHT TERMINOLOGY WIN DESCRIBED CITIES AND VENERATE THE TRADITION BEEN HERE WHICH SHOWS THE BEST OF INDIA AND OPEN AN OPEN METROPOLIS
YEAH WELL I AGREE ABOUT WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THE SHIPS THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THEIR BRAND THAT THE TOXIC BRAND OF POLITICS PRACTISED I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS A TISSUE LET'S DO YOU KNOW THAT'S AN ISSUE AT ALL I THINK ALL RIGHT THINKING PEOPLE WOULD CRITICISE THAT OBVIOUSLY HAVING GROWN UP IN A COSMOPOLITAN PLURAL CITY YOU KNOW THE RENAMING HAD PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW THE IDENTI CITY WAS SOUGHT TO BE DEFINED I DO MIND
BROADER POINT IS REALLY ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF NAMING AND I THINK THE COMPLEXITY I WAS HINTING AT WAS REALLY ESSENTIALLY ABOUT HOW ONE THINKS OF WHAT IT IS THAT NAMING REALLY DOES WHAT IS IT TO ASSIGN A PROPER NAME AND I SIGN HER PROPER NAME IS CREAM PEWTER SAID TO PROPERTIES OR SET OF CHARACTERISTICS FOR ANY ENTITY AND IN THE CASE OF A CITY ANY ATTEMPT TO NAME INEVITABLY MEANS YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPOSE ONE KIND OF AND DEFINITION ON IT AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
HAVING SAID THAT YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING AND YET I FEEL IN REVERSING IT ONE IS ALSO THEN SHARING THE OF THOSE ONE IS TRYING TO OPPOSE IN THAT THE ACT OF NAMING BECOMES A WAY OF EXCLUDING OTHER STORIES AND ANY ACT OF NAMING IS INHERENTLY IN THAT SENSE I THINK IN ONE OF THOSE KIND OF EXCLUSION EVEN COSMOPOLITAN BOMBAY FOR EXAMPLE
EXCLUDES A LOT OF WERE NAKANO STORIES OF WHAT IT IS TO BELONG TO BOMBAY AND SOMEONE IF YOU FEEL EXCLUDED FROM THAT DEFINITION SO I THINK IT'S GOT MORE COMPLICATED GAS IT'S A IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT I'M MAN IMAGINES APPLIED TO MANY OTHER CITIES MY IRON MAN COUNTRIES INDEED MY MA BURMA NOT LEAST I'M A GERMAN DOCTOR PER CENT COULD BE THANK YOU
TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP DEMOCRAT BERNIE SAUNDERS HAVE ELECTRIFIED THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL RACE WITH CRUSHING VICTORIES IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY THE BILLIONAIRE MISTER TRUMP IS LIKELY TO GET MORE THAN TWICE THE NUMBER OF VOTES OF THE NEXT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHILST BERNIE SAUNDERS BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY A HUGE MARGIN OR JIM JIM KNOCKED EIGHT WAS UP ALL NIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH SANDRA SUPPORTERS WHEN THE RESULT WAS FIRST CALLED
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU AND I WANT TO SAY I STILL LOVE ME
THE CROWD AROUND ME TO THE SOUND OF DEAFENING MUSIC ARE CELEBRATING ONE OF THE GREAT INSURRECTIONS OF AMERICAN POLITICS IN RECENT YEARS IN THE VICTORY OF BURMESE SANDRA'S OVER HILLARY CLINTON
THIS CROWD HAS SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH THE SUPPORTERS OF DONALD TRUMP WAS CELEBRATING IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE ROAD
THESE OTHER CANDIDATES THE MEN WHO HAVE COME FROM NOWHERE
AND WHO HAVE SET THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON A WHOLLY UNEXPECTED AND DIZZYING
WHAT BEGAN LAST WEEK AND I WANT WOULD VOTERS HERE IN I'M SURE CONFIRMED TONIGHT IS NOTHING SHORT OF THE BEGINNING OF A POLITICAL REVOLUTION
IT WAS A SPEECH THAT WHEN HE BEGAN HIS MAVERICK PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WITH A FEW HELPERS AND NO MONEY HE NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE
BUT LAST NIGHT AT HIS MOMENT OF VICTORY IN THE FIRST PRIMARY HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT
THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS COUNTRY
PEOPLE WILL NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE SERVED A CORRUPT CARE PAID FINALLY ANSWERS
BUTTONS
THE RIGHT WING REPUBLICANS WE OPPOSE MY
THIS ISN'T MY POLITICAL WAY YEAH I KNOW MIKE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME NEVER GET MORE THAN DOUBLE DIGITS OR THIS IS LIKE MY DREAM COME TRUE OR WHAT AND WHERE DOES IT GO FROM HERE
ALL RIGHT AWAY NO I THINK THAT IN A WAY DO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN GO ALL THE WAY WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SEE BUT I SURE HOPE HE DOES I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S THE BEST WHEN HE SAID THIS IS A POLITICAL REVOLUTION AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE COUNTRY READY
YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME OUT I HEARD THE END OF BERNIE SPEECH I HEARD SOME OF THE BEGINNING
FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS TO BERNIE YOU KNOW VARIOUS WE HAVE TO CONGRATULATE UP WE MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT I HEARD PIPES OF BERNIE SPEECH HE WANTS TO GIVE AWAY OUR COUNTRY FOXY WANTS TO GIVE AWAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT OUT
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET IT OUT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW DONALD TRUMP AT HIS VICTORY CELEBRATION LIKE BERNIE SANDERS ALTHOUGH THE TWO MEN COULD HARDLY BE MORE DIFFERENT HE HAS UNDERSTOOD THE DEPTH OF THE DISILLUSION OF MANY AMERICANS THE FEELING THAT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY WERE TAUGHT TO REVERE ISN'T WORKING FOR THEM BUT AGAINST
HIS ANSWER WHICH REPUBLICAN CRITICS SAY IS NOTABLY SHORT IN DETAIL IS IN EFFECT A PROMISE THAT THINGS WILL SOMEHOW BY HIS GOLDEN TOUCH GET BETTER
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ECONOMY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF JOBS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THE THINGS I SAID OUR BORDER EVERYTHING HEALTHCARE IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT SO HE LEADS THE FIELD
BASIC CRUISE BUSH AND RUBIO ARE BUNCHED TOGETHER IN THE CHASING PACK WILL ANY OF THEM BREAK FREE TO CHALLENGE
I ASKED THE CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR JOHN GACY WIN THE RACE HIS WINDOW DOWN AND IT'S NOW IN ESSENCE A FIVE PERSON RACE TRUMPS NUMBER SHRINKS WHEN HE GETS TO GO ONE ON ONE WITH SOMEONE HE IS TAKEN OUT COMPLETELY AND WHO IS THAT SOMEONE
I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY IT'S MARCO WILL BE RUBIO YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE IT TONIGHT BECAUSE HE'S HAD A BAD NIGHT HE WAS ROARING AWAY LAST WEEK AND WE ALL SAW THE DEBATE ON SATURDAY WHERE HE SHALL WE SAY HE HAD A MISTER
IF HE HAD HAD THE DEBATE OR YOU'D RESPONDED IN THE WAY MANY OF MY FRIENDS SAID HE SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO GOVERNOR CHRISTY WE'D BE HAVING A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE BECAUSE HE WAS GAINING GROUND COMING OUT OF IOWA I DO BELIEVE HE CAN REGAIN THE GROUND SIMPLY BECAUSE HE CONTINUES TO GET ENDORSEMENTS AND DRAW BIG CROWDS WHEREVER HE GOES I THINK I DO I HAVE NOW HAD SOARED TO THE DONE
THE DEMOCRATS AND BERNIE SANDERS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING PRIMARIES BUT THIS IS ALSO AN EXPECTED NOT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE VICTORY ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN COMING FOR A WHILE NOW BUT THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE THIS THROUGH THE PREVAILING DEMOCRAT VIEW IS THAT HE CAN'T
BERNIE SANDERS HIMSELF CALLS THE CLINTONS THE MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL ORGANISATION IN AMERICA
BUT HIS SUPPORTERS IN MANCHESTER OVERWHELMINGLY YOUNG WERE FULL OF BELIEF BUT IT COULD BE DONE HOW I ASKED HIS SENIOR ADVISOR HAD DIVINE
THIS IS A STORAGE VICTORY ANY SERVICE HAS WON BY A BIGGER MARGIN THAN ANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
IT'S A DEMONSTRATION OF HIS POTENTIAL AS A NOMINEE FOR THIS PARTY
RECORD NUMBERS OF PEOPLE LOOKS LIKE TODAY TO THE BODY YOU CAN BE SOMEONE YOUNG PEOPLE BY AN UNBELIEVABLE AN OVERWHELMING MARGIN AGAIN A RECORD MARGIN
INDEPENDENT BORIS COMING TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE SUPPORTING HERE WE'VE GOT NEW PEOPLE REGISTERING A TO THE PRESENT THAT'S A MESSAGE WE CAN BRING YOUR PEOPLE AND WE CAN EXPAND THE ELECTORATE IN THAT'S HOW
TAD TAD TAVINE THEIR SENIOR ADVISOR TO BERNIE SAUNDERS BELIEVES THAT HE CAN WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IT'S SIX MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK THE PICKETS ARE STANDING ON THE ROAD OUTSIDE THE QUEEN'S HOSPITAL HERE IN ROMFORD CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAVE THE PUBLIC SUPPORT POLE SHOW THAT ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF THE PUBLIC DO BACK THERE ACTION
BUT THERE ARE SOME PARTICULARLY PERHAPS AMONGST THOSE WHO WERE ONCE JUNIOR DOCTORS THEMSELVES WHO ARE QUIETLY CRITICAL NOT JUST OF THE STRIKE ACTION BUT ALSO OF THE DEMAND FOR SHORTER HOURS AND BETTER PAY
ONE OF THOSE IS DOCTOR HENRY GOOD ALL HE TRAINED AS A DOCTOR IN THE LATE SIXTIES HE WAS A G.P. FOR MANY YEARS WENT ON TO BECOME A CONSULTANT OCCUPATIONAL PHYSICIAN HE JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM THE NEW FOREST AND LISTENING TO HIM OR CURRENT JUNIOR DOCTOR RENA AGAR WHILE WHO'S IN A STUDIO IN LONDON DOCTOR GOODALL FIRST OF ALL WHY ARE YOU NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED BY THE JUNIOR DOCTOR'S CASE
GOOD MORNING NICK AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IS STRONGER THAN IT WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH BASICALLY BASICALLY WHERE WE ARE TODAY
IS HEARD THE TACTICS OF THE B.M.A. HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP STRIKES BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY GOVERNMENT AND THEY FEEL THEY'RE REASONABLE DEMANDS ARE NOT BEING MET
HMM IF WE GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
IT WAS NORMAL FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THE FIRST YEAR TO WORK CAN AM SIXTY SEVENTY UP TO NINETY HOURS A WEEK AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY MY EXPERIENCE THAT'S EXCLUDING EATING SLEEPING AND TO HER TOILET REQUIREMENTS AND BEING ON CALL OVER ONE HUNDRED HOURS A WEEK WAS NORMAL
NORMAL AND GOOD THING WHAT THE N.H.S. ARE GOOD FOR THE DOCTORS IN TERMS THEY'RE TRAINING
WELL I THINK IT WAS GOOD FOR THE DOCTORS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THEY GOT EXPERIENCE THE WAY YOU LEARN IN MEDICINE THE APPRENTICESHIP YOU DO THE TRAINING OF TEN YEARS TO REACH CONSULTANT LEVEL
IT DEMANDS THAT YOU PUT IN THE HOURS AND BY PUTTING IN THE HOURS AND YOU SEE THE EXPERIENCE WHO SEE MATTRESSES TO DISEASE AND
AND THE DIFFICULTY OF NOT DOING LONG HOURS HE'S VERY SIMPLY THAT YOU DON'T GET AS MUCH EXPERIENCE IN SO IT TAKES YOU LONGER TO DEVELOP THEIR CONFIDENCE AND THAT EXPERIENCE AT THE FEAR DOCTOR GOODALL MAYBE THAT YOU ALSO BECOME VERY TIRED AND YOU BECOME UNSAFE AND YOU BECOME
WELL TIREDNESS DOES NOT EQUAL THE LACK OF SAFETY NECESSARILY YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH TIREDNESS YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS WHEN YOU'RE TIRED AND THAT'S PART OF THE WORLD LEOPARDS PART OF THEIR TRAINING
FORGIVE ME RING ME BRINGING RENA AGAR WHILE WHO'S BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR COME BACK IN A SECOND DOCTOR GOODALL IT IS TRUE ISN'T IT THAT YOUR PREDECESSORS AS JUNIOR DOCTORS WORKED MUCH MUCH MUCH LONGER HOURS THAN YOUR GENERATION DO THANK YOU YES IT WAS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE HOUR WEEKS ARE VERY COMMON IN THE DAYS THAT DOCTOR GOOD I WAS DESCRIBING DOCTORS USED TO GO TO WORK ON A FRIDAY MORNING AND NOT RETURN TILL MONDAY AFTERNOON AND THANK GOD THOSE DAYS HAVE CHANGED WITH THE ADVENT OF THE CALMAN REPORT AND MODERNISING MEDICAL CAREERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS DO YOU WORK VERY LONG HOURS I RECENTLY FOR I'VE JUST FINISHED AN EIGHTY FIVE HOUR WEEK LAST SUNDAY I RECENTLY CAN WORK ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE HOURS OVER TWELVE DAYS SO I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY ISSUE ABOUT JUNIOR DOCTORS NOT WORKING LONG HOURS OUR CONCERNS REGARDING THE CURRENT JUNIOR CONTRACT IS ABOUT ENSURING WE HAVE GOOD CONTINUITY OF CARE GOOD SAFE WORKING PATTERNS PRIMARILY FOR PATIENTS' SAFETY
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SAFETY ALL THE REPRESENTS IS THE B.M.A. ALWAYS SAY SAVED US A LOT ABOUT PAY ABS GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THE SAME ON SATURDAYS AND THE B.M.'S A SO YOU SHOULD PAT IT'S FRANK HE'S A PERFECTLY REASONABLE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT AT THE END ISN'T IT IT'S NOT ABOUT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S A COST NEUTRAL PACKAGE THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS PATIENT SAFETY
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO EXTEND THAT CURRENT NUMBER OF JUNIOR DOCTORS TO INCREASE THEIR SERVICES FROM MONDAY TO SUNDAY WE ALREADY STRUGGLE FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY TO CREATE THE SERVICE THAT WE NEED WE HAVE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RAY TO GAP'S MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DEMORALISATION ON THE COALFACE
IT WAS A QUESTION SO THE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK THE MINISTER FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS OVER THE WEEKEND THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DOING THIS YOU CAN AMAZE NOT WAY BUT THE LETTER GIRL LIZ I'M GOING TO HAVE TO YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT IT WEREN'T LODGE I WAS UNLESS OR YOU GOING TO EXTEND THE SERVICE OR STRETCH THE SERVICE FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY NO POINT BOTH OF THOSE SAFER PATIENTS
DOCTOR GOOD IF YOU GO THE ROOM THESE ARE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE HAINES I THINK THE REALITY IS WE HAVE AN AGEING POPULATION
WE WILL NEED MORE CARE IN THE COMMUNITY HOSPITALS THE GOVERNMENT HAS THIS TARGET OF HAVING SEVEN DAY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SERVICE BUT OF COURSE IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT JUNIOR DOCTORS THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR ANCILLARY STAFF FOR LAB TECHNICIANS FOR PHYSIOTHERAPISTS
AND MANY OTHER DISCIPLINES RADIOGRAPHERS AND SO FORTH TO MANAGE THE EQUIPMENT TO USE EQUIPMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND IS THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THIS MEANS MASSIVELY MORE THINK YOU BOTH AGREE ON THAT AND FOR TRAINEE HAD I DON'T WANT TO BE LOUISA VIEW WE HAVE TO STOP THERE I'M REALLY SORRY WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE PIPS BECKON BECAUSE THAT IS IT FROM US FOR TODAY OUR EDITORS WERE ANDREW BRYSON AND DAN KELLY FROM ASSAULT HAVE A VERY GOOD MORNING
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAD BEGUN A SECOND'S TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE IN A DISPUTE ABOUT WORKING HOURS AND PAY WHICH IN OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED BUT DOCTORS WILL STILL PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE
UNDER THE PROPOSALS JUNIOR DOCTORS WOULD NO LONGER BE PAID A PREMIUM RATE FOR WORKING MUCH OF SATURDAY THEY ARGUE THE CHANGES WOULD MEAN THE HEALTH SERVICE WOULD BECOME OVERSTRETCHED AND UNSAFE FOR PATIENTS BUT CHRIS HOPS AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF N.H.S. PROVIDERS WHICH REPRESENTS THE TRUST'S TOLD TODAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LOOK AT IMPOSING A SETTLEMENT
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS FOUR YEARS LATER THREE THOUSAND OPERATION'S BEEN CANCELLED TODAY WE CAN'T CARRY ON LIKE THIS WE NEED TO BRING THIS TO A CONCLUSION IF THE B.M.A. WON'T ACCEPT A FAIR AND REASONABLE OFFER THEN YES IT WAS LEGITIMATE AND SENSIBLE FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CONSIDER IN POSITION
