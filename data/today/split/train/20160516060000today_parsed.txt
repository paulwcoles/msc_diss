AT THE END OF WHAT THEY CALL HERE THE AMERICAN WAR NOW IT'S OVERLOADED INFLATABLES THEN IT WAS RICKETY FISHING BOATS OVERFLOWING WITH PEOPLE THEY BECAME KNOWN AS THE BOAT PEOPLE
BY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WORTH FLEEING THIS COUNTRY BY BOAT EVERY MONTH
THE YE RECKONS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DIED AT SEA
IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION VIETNAMESE LEFT THE COUNTRY
COFFEE LES WAS RESCUED FROM A FISHING BOAT BY BRITISH NAVY SHIP
FROM HIS HOME IN WILTSHIRE HE TOLD ME THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW REMINDS HIM OF IT
VERY REMINISCENT OF NIGHT MY LIFE OF OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE ARE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING TO LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND WHO PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO TAKE SUCH A RISK TO FIND A BETTER ENVIRONMENT BETTER LIVE WELL
IT MUST BE SO MUCH GOING ON IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY WHEN YOU'RE SO DESPERATE AND
YOU THINK WHATEVER YOU STAY THERE'S NO FUTURE AND THERE IS POSSIBLE POSSIBLY THEN A LIST THERE'S A CHANCE OF YOU GETTING A LIFE FOR YOURSELF I DO HERSELF OR YOUR FAMILY

SHE LEFT WITH HER THREE CHILDREN ON THE FIRST NIGHT YOU HAD ALREADY KISSED
THINKING THAT THIS
I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION HERE IN THE FUTURE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE IF THE ESTATE WAS WORTH TAKING THAT
THIS COUNTRY HAS CHANGED SO MUCH SINCE THEN AND I'LL BE HEARING HOW THE BOOMING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR IS DRAWING MANY PEOP
BUT THE POLITICS HERE HAVEN'T CHANGED SO MUCH BILL HAYTON WAS A B.B.C. CORRESPONDENT IN THE COUNTRY AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT MINDER A PRECONDITION OF REPORTING HERE WHAT HE COULD DO

THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE HEARING SOME OF THE STORIES FROM THIS REMARKABLE COUNTRY
SARAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE WILL AND YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THAT WE'RE DOING TODAY ON TWITTER THE HASHTAG IS WORLD ON THE MOVE ALL ONE WORD HASHTAG WORLD ON THE MOVE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS NOW AT THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THERE ARE OTHER STORIES AND WOOD COVERING THOSE OF COURSE
AS THE PROGRAMME GOES ON THE MAIN ONE IN MANY PAPERS OF COURSE IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED AT OLD TRAFFORD IN MANCHESTER YESTERDAY THE SUN'S HEADLINE ON THAT RED FACES THE MIRROR'S HEADLINE OLD TRAFFORD DUMMY BOMB BLUNDER THEIR BLUNDER OF COURSE BEING THAT IT WASN'T EVEN A HOAX IT WAS IN FACT A DEVICE DEVELOPED FOR A TRAINING EXERCISE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT THERE THE TELEGRAPH TRIES TO MOVE THE STORY ON WITH THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT COMING UP
FOOTBALL BOMB SCARE SPARKS EURO TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN FEARS IT SAYS QUOTING TERRORISM EXPERTS ARE SAYING THAT THE RESPONSE IN MANCHESTER WAS IN PART A REACTION TO ANXIETY POST PARIS AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF TERROR THREAT COMING FROM THE IRISH REPUBLIC AS WELL
THERE ARE AS THERE ARE ANY DAY STORIES ABOUT MIGRATION ON THE FRONT PAGES AS WELL THE DAILY EXPRESS HEADLINE SOARING COST OF TEACHING MIGRANT CHILDREN THE PAPER SAYS IT'S A THREE BILLION POUND BILL AND THE F. T. SAYS THE GREASE IS SENDING FEWER MIGRANTS BACK TO TURKEY THAN EXPECTED RAISING WORRIES THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER SURGE OF MIGRANTS LATER IN THE SUMMER
THE INTERNATIONAL PAPERS WON'T ARRIVE UNTIL TOMORROW BUT I'M FOR A SOMEBODY TO TRANSLATE FOR ME THE OFFICIAL PAPER FOR THE YOUTH HERE IN HO CHI MIN CITY IT'S CALLED TANG IN ITS LEAD STORIES ABOUT ATTEMPT TO OPEN UP A RESTAURANT
ATTEMPT THERE WAS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO PUT IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EACH UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS NOT WORKED THERE ISN'T ENGLISH LANGUAGE DAILY CALLED VIETNAM NEWS AND IT'S PICKED UP ON A STORY THAT'S PROMPTED SOMETHING REALLY HEARD OF HERE WHICH IS
PUBLIC PROTESTS THEY STARTED AFTER MILLIONS OF FISH WASHED UP DEAD ALONG THE COASTLINE LOCALS BLAMED POLLUTION FROM A STEEL MILL A MILL THERE
RUN BY CHINESE AND THAI WINNIE'S INVESTOR AND THE INVESTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T POINTED THE FIGURE BUT ACCORDING TO THE PAPER THEY WILL BE ANNOUNCING THE RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT CALL THIS MASS FISH DEATH
IT IS NOW A QUARTER PAST SIX ERRORS IN VIETNAM LOOKING RATHER HOT AND SUNNY ON THE WEBCAM THERE LIKE LETTIE
YES IT'S GOT A BIG PAY YOU TO GO AS WELL AND I HEAR IT IN CHILLI ISH LONDON ALONG OF COURSE WITH ROBBIE ON HE'S GOT THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS INCLUDING ROB THE C.B.I. WHO ALONG WITH OTHERS SEE GROWTH SLOWING
THE ECONOMY THAT IS RIGHT INDEED YES THE CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY PREDICTS THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY WILL GROW AT A SLOWER RATE THIS YEAR AND NEXT IT'S BLAMING A SLOWDOWN IN CHINA AND UNCERTAINTY OVER THE REFERENDUM ON WHETHER BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN IN OR LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THE C.B.I. REPRESENTS OR BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP ABOUT A THIRD OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WORK FORCE IN THE U.K. AND AT FORECASTS THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH OF TWO PERCENT THIS YEAR AND NEXT A DOWNGRADE ON ITS PREVIOUS PREDICTION WITH US THIS MORNING CAROLYN FAIRBURN DIRECTOR GENERAL
OF THE C.B.I. AND ALSO JOINED BY GERARD LIONS A MEMBER OF COLUMNIST FOR BREAKFAST AND FORMALLY OF STANDARD CHARTERED BANK GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING CAROLINE FAB AND HOW MUCH OF THIS SLOW DOWN YOU'RE PREDICTING IS BECAUSE OF REFERENDUM UNCERTAINTY
SOME OF IT THAT THERE ARE AND IT'S A TIME OF RICH HAVE REALLY SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY SO WE DO HAVE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA WE HAVE OTHER FACTORS BUT WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE WEIGHING ON OUR FORECAST THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE REFERENDUM I'VE BEEN EATING BUSINESSES AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE POSTPONING INVESTMENT DECISIONS THEY WANT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THIS FORECAST IS A FORECAST ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE STAY
IAN IS NOT A FORECAST OF THE EFFECTS OF BRECHT'S RIGHT CAN YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF COMPANIES THAT HAVE DECIDED TO PAUSE HIRING OR POSTPONE INVESTMENT DECISIONS CERTAIN HE'S SO I WAS WITH A BUILDING SOCIETY IN WALES RECENTLY THERE WHERE INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND AND HOUSING DECISIONS WERE BEING POSTPONED I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ADVERTISERS BROADCASTERS WHO ARE SEEING SLOW SLOWDOWN IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET
AND SOME CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES SO PRETTY WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE ECONOMY PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE RIGHT SAID THE YOUR FORECASTERS BASED ON BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION DO YOU AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY THAT IF WE LEAVE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A TECHNICAL RECESSION YES I THINK MOST ECONOMISTS WOULD AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE A SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY HOW LONG AND HOW DEEP WILL DEPEND ON HOW QUICKLY WE DO TRADE DEALS
THE PROCESS OF LEAVING IS VERY COMPLICATED IT'S LIKELY TAKE A LONG TIME AND TRADE DEALS ARE HARD TO DO SO OUR OWN FORECAST AND WITH P. W. C. DOES ALSO SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF A TECHNICAL RECESSION SO YES WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH IT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT SHOCK THERE WAS A SURVEY BY THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE LAST WEEK WHICH SUGGESTED THAT MORE BUSINESSES WANT OUT OF THE E.U. THAN DEAD JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IT'S IT DOESN'T THAT SHOW
YOU'RE LOSING THE ARGUMENT TO THOSE AMONG THOSE BUSINESS LEADERS WERE UNDERSIDE ABSOLUTELY NOT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEY DATA AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE SURVEY DATA FROM BUSINESS SECTOR'S ALL OVER THE ECONOMY FROM THE FOOD AND DRINK FEDERATION SEVENTY ONE PERCENT IN EEUGH MANUFACTURING SIXTY PER CENT IN OUR OWN SERVICE EIGHTY PER CENT AND THE BCT STILL HE'S STRONG MAJORITY IN FAVOUR SAYING IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MAJORITY OF VOICE OF BUSINESS IS FOR STAYING IN
LET'S TALK TO GERARD LINES A MEMBER OF ECONOMISTS FOR BRECHT'S OR DO YOU ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE U.K. LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS CAUSING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
OF COURSE IT IS THEY CAN BE SELF FULFILLING AS WELL ONE SHOULD REMEMBER BUT WE HAD THE SAME DEBATE THIS TIME LAST YEAR AHEAD AT THE GENERAL ELECTION THEN THE FEAR WAS THAT LABOUR MIGHT WIN WITH THE S. P. AND WE HEARD PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MESSAGE REALLY THE MESSAGE FROM THE C.B.I. TO FORECAST THIS MORNING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE U.K. ECONOMY THAT'S BEEN SLOWING NOW FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH A MUCH WEAKER WORLD ECONOMY BUT YES I DID MAKE A REPORT FOR BORIS JOHNSON IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND FORTY AND SAID THAT
IF I LOOKED IN THE VERY NEAR TURN FROM A PRAXIS SCENARIO THAT WOULD ADD TO UNCERTAINTY BUT VERY IMPORTANTLY A GLOBAL BRECHT'S IT WAS MUCH MORE INPUT POSITIVE FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY IN THE MEDIUM AND LONGER TERM THAN STAYING IN AND I'M REFORMED I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE SURPRISE THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PICK CHANGE AN ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE U.K. YEAH AND SO DOES SUGGEST DOESN'T IT THAT THAT BUSINESS IS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN LEADING EUROPEAN YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT CREATING JOBS THEY'RE NOT
INVESTING MONEY IN A BUILDING SOCIETY IN EAT THE ADVERTISING AGENCIES THAT THAT ARE CHANGING THEIR BUSINESS BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE THE U.K. COULD LEAVE LOOK WE CAN TRY AND CONSTRUCT EVERY NEGATIVE THING THAT'S HAPPENING IS BEEN DOWN TO DONALD TRUMP OR PR EXITS AT THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT LET'S BE REALISTIC ABOUT THIS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IS THE FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF THE U.K. ECONOMY HAS ALLOWED IT TO CREATE JOBS WHEN THE EUROZONE AND ALBERT'S ON BY WESTERN EUROPE HAVE NOT
ADAPTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY IS A BIG POSITIVE FOR THE ECONOMY AS WE LOOK FURTHER AHEAD IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT INTENTIONS THEY'VE ACTUALLY PERFORM CHUMMY BE SAFER COME SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME AND THAT'S AS MUCH DUE TO GLOBAL FACTORS HAS MUCH TO TIP BUSINESSES THINKING TWICE ABOUT A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS RIGHT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE MAJOR FORECASTERS SAY WE SEE THE I.M.F. ET-CETERA THEY'VE HIGHLIGHTED THE UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY ALSO ALL HIGHLIGHT BUT THE SLOWEST GROWTH THE REGIONS OF THE WORLD ECONOMY
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND TO GET US A PERSPECTIVE IN THIS DEBATE DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC TURBULENCE IF THE U.K. VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I THOUGHT THAT THE LONG TERM BENEFITS BUT THE CHANGE IN THE SHORT TERM THERE COULD BE AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE I.M.F. THE C.B.I. HAVE JUST SAID THERE COULD BE A RECESSION
IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THEIR TESTIMONY LAST WEEK FOR THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE MISTER REES MOGG ACTUALLY VERY MUCH PUT THE CHANCE FROM THE BACK FOOT WHEN HE ASKED HIM ABOUT THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS IN THE TREASURY MODEL BUT CAME BACK TO YOUR TO QUESTION I'VE SAID THIS MYSELF TWO YEARS AGO BORIS JOHNSON HAS SAID THEY COULD BE WE CALL IT A NIKE SHREWISH THAT IS THERE COULD BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEAR TERM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS
EXIT IS POSITIVE FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE OUTCOME FOR ANY ECONOMY DEPENDS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS WHICH WE'VE HEARD ARE SLOWING NOTHING TO BE WHIPPED
POLICY AND CONFIDENT BUT SHE COULD BE A RECESSION I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A RECESSION BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN AND WHATEVER HAPPENS AFTER JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THE REALITY IS THE U.K. ECONOMY IS SLOWING FULL STOP AND THEREFORE WE NEED TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF DEBT IN THE ECONOMY IN BOTH THE PERSONAL SECTOR AND THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR
AND THAT'S NOTHING TO DO IT BRECHT'S O.K. GERARD LINES AND CAROLINE FARE THEN THANK YOU BASS LET'S TAKE A BREATHER FROM ALL THINGS REFERENDUM AND TALK TO OUR MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING DUVETS WILLIAMS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE MIGHT AND GROUP GOOD MORNING MORNING AT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS SAID TODAY THAT IT FEARS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN A CELLAR HAS BEEN SELLING SOME OF IT'S A STOCK HOLDINGS I RIGHT WELL IT'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELLING ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL UNITY EQUITY FUN'S OVER THE LAST FOUR WEEKS OR SO THERE'S ABOUT FORTY FOUR BILLION
DOLLARS OF CAPITAL WHICH WILL COME OUT OF THOSE AND IF YOU TAKE THE YEAR TO DATE IT'S ABOUT NINETY BILLION SO THERE HAS BEEN GENERALLY A KIND OF CAUTION ON MARKETS AND QUITE A FEW MARKETS ARE MISSING RIGHT D. C. I P. D. D. D. H. A BODY TODAY HE SAID THAT GROWTH IN WAGES IS LIKELY TO REMAIN STUCK IN THE SLOW LANE UNTIL THE END OF THE DECADE CLEARLY NOT GOOD NEWS FOR A HUGE PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE WHEN DO YOU THINK WAGES WILL FINALLY TAKE OFF
I THINK WHICH GROWTH IS VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY PRODUCTIVITY DATA WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING ABOUT THE LAST EIGHT YEARS REALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS THAT ACTUALLY PRODUCTIVITY HASN'T IMPROVED ROUND THE WORLD WE SEE MUCH LESS INVESTMENT GOING INTO REAL CAPITAL COMPANIES ARE HOLDING THEIR CASH BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE SLOWDOWN IN THE WORK GROWTH AND I THINK THAT'S LEADING TO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS NOT LEADING TO PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND THAT'S HOLDING BACK WHICH GROWTH IN MY VIEW
LET'S TALK ABOUT A COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN IN AN AWFUL LOT OF HOT WATER OVER THE PAST YEAR VOLKSWAGEN AFTER THE DIESEL OMISSIONS RIGGING SCANDAL WILL NORWAY'S SOVEREIGN WEALTH ON THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OR SAID IT IS GOING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE DERBY IT SEEMS AT THE BILL FOR VOLKSWAGEN JUST KEEPS GOING UP AND UP YES I'M IN THE UNDERLYING VOLKSWAGEN CARS OBVIOUSLY CONTINUED TO SELL BUT ACTUALLY THE COMPANY ITSELF IS IN QUITE A LOT OF TROUBLE HERE THE THE NORWEGIAN AXE
PENSION FUND ACTUALLY HOLDS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE COMPANY IT'S THE FOURTH LARGEST SHAREHOLDER SO IT'S GOT QUITE A BIG CLAIM ON THE MAIN COMPANY THAT'S OF THE BILL WILL KEEP RISING A FORTUNE I THINK SO B.H.S. WE CAN'T NOT TALK ABOUT B.H.S. THE DEADLINE FOR INTERESTED BUYERS IS TOMORROW AND THE NUMBER OF BIDDERS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO IMPROVE THEIR OFFERS BEFORE THE DEADLINE DOES THIS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE PERHAPS SEVERAL VIABLE NEW OWNERS FOR B.H.S. AND THAT B.H.S. WILL BE SAVED
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE SAVED IN ITS IN ITS CURRENT FORM WHAT WE WILL SEE IS QUITE A LOT THOSE RETAIL SITES ARE QUITE VALUABLE SITES THEY'RE QUITE WELL PITCHED AND SO THERE'S GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO USE THOSE SITES IN A MORE PRODUCTIVE WAY SO I THINK YOU'LL FIND QUITE A LOT OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SITES ARE TAKEN FROM THE BIDDERS THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO SITES UNFORTUNATE WHICH THEY MAKE IT AND WE CLOSED SO THERE WILL BE JOB LOSSES YOU THINK THEY MAY BE JOBLESS IS I THINK YES O.K. THANK YOU TODAY'S WILLIAMS THEIR MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE MIGHT AND GROUP NOW AT CABLE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AS ONE OF THE OLDEST BRITISH COMPANIES
LISTED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE BUT TODAY IT PASSES INTO AMERICAN HANDS IT'S BEEN BOUGHT BY THE U.S. FIRM LIBERTY GLOBAL THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL CABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD IN A DEAL WORTH THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS WILL THE ORIGINS OF CABLE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BEGIN WAY BACK IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO WHEN JOHN PENDER A MANCHESTER COTTON MERCHANT JOINED OTHER BUSINESSMEN AS DIRECTOR OF THE ENGLISH AND IRISH MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH COMPANY RAN A TELEGRAPH CABLE SERVICE BETWEEN LONDON AND DUBLIN WE CAN TALK TO MIKE FREEZE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LIBERTY GLOBAL WHO JOINS US FROM DENVER IF UNITED STATES GOOD MORNING

IN LATIN AMERICAN A GRIPPING WORKABLE HOURS A BRIDGE TO THE EUROPEAN NUMBERS ARE HUGE WEALTH POTENTIAL AND KIM AWAY I SUPPOSE AS A PRETTY FIT IT'S A GREAT STORY HISTORY AS YOU SAY WE RESPECT THAT SO THAT WHEN WE DID THE DEAL IT'S A VERY WELL RUN COMPANY WITH GREAT GROWTH POTENTIAL AND BEAUTY SEE IF YOU BE SERVICES A LEADER IN MOST OF ITS MARKETS
WE'RE THRILLED THE CLOSER STEEL COULD MEASURE TEAM IN BUILD FOR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES DOWN THERE THIS IS MUCH LESS EH A EUROPEAN COMPANY THESE DAYS WHICH IS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE AMERICAS
IT'S REALLY ALL THAT'S LEFT IT'S THE ONLY BIT OF KIM A WIRELESS ED STILL OPERATES TODAY IN AMERICAN COMEDIAN REGION AND SO YES THAT'S CORRECT
WHAT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A LARGE INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY WHEN GIVEN WE'VE SEEN IN THE IN EUROPE RECENTLY THE AUTHORITIES LESS KEEN ON BIG MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD END UP WITH RISING RETAIL COSTS
I THINK THE CONCERN IN THE U.K. AROUND THE O.TWO THREE MERGER WORSE AROUND TWO BIG MOBILE COMPANIES COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE A LARGER COMPANY WAS PRETTY LARGE MARKET SHARE WE OPERATE IN TWELVE EUROPEAN MARKETS INCLUDE THE U.K. IT'S VIRGIN MEDIA
AND NOW EIGHTEEN MARKETS ARE MORE ENLIGHTENED AMERICAN EQUIVALENT REGION ALL IN THE SAME BUSINESS BUT IN DIFFERENT MARKETS ARE WORKING IN EUROPE IN PARTICULAR AND IN THE U.K. WITH THE ENCUMBRANCE AND DRIVING INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE MO GROWTH WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR COMPETITION SO WE'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THAT EQUATION

NATALIE BENNETT IS TO STEP DOWN AS THE LEADER OF THE GREEN PARTY IN AUGUST THE AUSTRALIAN FORMER JOURNALIST SAYS THAT DURING HER FOUR YEARS IN CHARGE SHE GOT SOMETHING'S RIGHT AND SOMETHING'S WRONG BECAUSE SHE ISN'T A SMOOTH SPIN TRAINED POLITICIAN
THANK YOU KATHY IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN UNTIL RECENTLY IT SCARCELY SEEM POSSIBLE BUT THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN GREECE HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE DEAL DONE BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY THAT DOES NOT HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEMS ARE AT AN END THERE ARE STILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STRANDED IN GREECE WHO WANT TO MOVE TO OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE JOHN ALLY NOW BY YOU GITA LAMAR WHO'S OUR CORRESPONDENT AT THE MANY REFUGEE CAMP ON THE GREEK SIDE OF THE GREEK
MACEDONIAN BORDER IT IS A LONG DELAY I'M AFRAID ON THIS LINE BUT GOOD MORNING TO YOU YOU GITA AND CAN YOU JUST SPELL OUT WHY FOR GREASE THESE IMPROVE FIGURES DO NOT MAKING THE PROBLEMS ARE OVER
WHAT I'M STANDING AT THE MANY IN RIGHT HERE THERE ARE ABOUT NINE AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED IN GREECE BEFORE THE E.U. TURKEY DEAL WAS SIGNED SO THEY CAN'T BE SENT BACK UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THAT DEAL BUT THE MACEDONIAN BORDER HERE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CLOSES THE TWENTY THIRD OF FEBRUARY SO THEY CAN'T MOVE FORWARD EITHER WHICH MEANS THEY JUST STRANDED HERE IN GREECE AND LIKE THEM AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF GREECE WHO WERE BASICALLY START
HERE IT IN MANY THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS IS NOT EVEN A FORMER CAM THIS IS JUST PEOPLE WHO WERE WAITING WHO ARE STILL WAITING AND HOPING THAT THE BORDER WILL OPEN AND THEN GET ACROSS ACROSS TO MACEDONIA AND TO THE REST OF EUROPE AND SO THEY WANT TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE OUT TOO
WHERE THEY SAY THEY CAN GIVE THEM BETTER FACILITIES BUT THAT'S IT IS IT IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION AND ASKED A SPOKESMAN FROM THE GREEK GOVERNMENT WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN AND THEY SAY THAT THE E.U. HAS PLEDGED TO RELOCATE ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE THEY'RE EXPECTING Y. U. GOVERNMENTS TO DO THAT BUT THEY HAVE SAID THAT IT'S A PROCESS THAT'S TAKING A VERY LONG TIME
THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION AFTER THIS DEAL BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY THAN ALMOST EVERYBODY ARRIVED WOULD BE INSTANTLY SENT HOME AGAIN SENT BACK TO TURKEY AT LEAST BUT THAT SEEMS NOT TO BE HAPPENING YOU GITA DO WE KNOW WHY
AGAIN BECAUSE ONCE THEY COME IN THEY'LL TAKE INTO THESE ATTENTION CENTRES THERE THEIR PAPERS HAVE TO BE PROCESSED AND IT'S ONLY AFTER THAT THAT THEY CAN BE SENT BACK
GREECE DOES BELIEVE THAT THE E.U. TURKEY DEALERS WORKING OVER THE MONTH OF ME ARRIVALS MIGRANT ARRIVALS HERE HAVE DROPPED TO LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE MONTHS BEFORE THE DEAL WAS SIGNED
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW HIS PEOPLE HURON CAMPS ACROSS GREECE ARE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING WITH FAMILY THAT'S ALREADY IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE BUT ALSO WITH FAMILY THEY'VE LEFT BEHIND IN SYRIA OR EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY
SO THE INFORMATION IS GETTING THROUGH TO THOSE MIGRANTS THERE ACTUALLY IF YOU DO GET INTO GREECE YOU WILL BE PUT IN A DETENTION CENTRE YOU PROBABLY BE SENT BACK TO TURKEY AND THOSE WHO HAVE GOT HERE EARLIER I'M NOT BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE BORDER HAS BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO ACROSS TO THE REST OF EUROPE THAT'S PERHAPS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE SEEN THOSE ARRIVAL NUMBERS COMING DOWN YOU CAN IN THE MANY REFUGEE CAMP THANK YOU
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THIS COUNTRY VIETNAM THE MOVING HERE MANY TO GET AN EDUCATION OVERSEAS BUT SOME ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE NUMBERS
ECONOMIST AND HIM HE'S BEEN LOOKING AT MIGRATION PATTERNS HERE IN THE COUNTRY TOLD ME IT WAS A SAD MYSTERY
ONE PERSON I SPOKE TO SAID AS MANY AS FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE WHO LEAVE DIS
DOCTOR JIM TOLD ME ABOUT THE MORE CONVENTIONAL REASONS FOR LEAVE
THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVING FOR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IS RISING IN THE U.S. A LAWN VIETNAMESE RANKED AMONG THE TOP TEN COUNTRIES
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OF STUDENTS GOING TO STUDY IN THE U.S. AND THAT NUMBER YOU'RE STILL RAISING EXPONENTIALLY OVER DECADES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE LEFT DO YOU GET ANY SENSE
THAT PERHAPS EVEN WITH STUDENTS LEAVING PARTLY BECAUSE OF THOSE WHO ARE NOW COMING BACK THAT THAT IS SLOW
NO I THINK THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING BACK IN
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBERS ON THIS BUT MY SENSE IS THAT HE'S RAISING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING
BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR MIGRATING AND GOING ABROAD TO STUDY TO WORK IS RISING FASTER THAN THE NUMBERS COMING BACK SO I THINK THE NET MEMBERS IS ACTUALLY ON THE RICE NET EMIGRATION IS STILL GOING
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT I SUPPOSE HE'S TRYING TO DEAL WITH IT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT IS HAPPY ABOUT BECAUSE GOING ABROAD TO LOOK FOR ONE
WELL JOINING OPPORTUNITIES I'LL BOTH GOOD THINGS BECAUSE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK
THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING A LOT OF WHAT ENCOURAGING THESE KINDS OF MIGRATION THERE ENCOURAGING MIGRATION BECAUSE WHAT THEY HOPE THAT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY VIETNAM WILL BENEFIT FROM THEIR SKILLS THAT PEOPLE LEARN OVERSEE ABSOLUTELY
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THAT MAC ME TOO THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE RETURNING I THINK IN TERMS OF THE VALUE THAT THIS GUY'S ARE BRINGING
IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY COME BACK IN THE STUDY OR TAKE COMPANIES THEY COME BACK AND THEY STEPPED UP HIS OFFICE IS IN VIETNAM IN WHICH CITY IN THAT THE SAME TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE U.S.
AND CREATING THIS I'M WHERE YOUNG VIETNAMESE PEOPLE CAN GO BACK IN
OF COURSE PEOPLE GOING FOR EDUCATION IS ONE THING BUT THERE IS ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM HERE OF FORCED LABOUR
TRAFFICKING I MEAN THE MIGRANT BRIDE NUMBERS ARE PHENOMENAL IT HAPPENS ALONG THE BODY ARE PROVINCES IN THE MIC ON DELTA AND SOMETIMES IN THE BODY ARE PROVINCES IN THE NORTH OF HERE
WE DO NOT HEAVEN OFFICIAL MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO WERE VICTIMS OF LEAVING BECAUSE OF THIS FORCED LABOUR
BUT THESE ARE THE REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH ONE FIGURE I SAW FOR MIGRANT BRIDES WERE SOMETHING ON MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND IN THE FIVE YEARS TO TWENTY TEN THAT'S BE LIVEABLE AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING SOLD BY THEN
IT'S HARD TO SAY IF THEY HAD BEEN SOLD WHICH IS A VERY COMPLICATED STORY I THINK IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO
FOR EXAMPLE AND THIS IS JUST THE GODEL'S FROM OUR RESEARCH WORK PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR IN THIS FAMILY IS IN THEY REALLY REALLY DESPERATE FOR A WEEK
WHETHER OR NOT THEY STAY IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN THEIR PROVINCE AT ALL SO FIVE OR WHETHER THEY HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND YOU GO TO A MARKET AND SOME PEOPLE WILL EXCHANGE SEEM QUITE THIS KINDS OBSCENE CART EXCHANGE
NEW RELATIONSHIPS IN HIS GUYS FROM I DON'T KNOW A BRIDE OVERSEAS WILL SENT THESE TEXTS TO THE SCHOOL'S MAKING PROMISES ABOUT A FUCHSIA THAT THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S MORE PROMISING THAN LEAPING AT HOME
SO THEY MIGHT CHOOSE TO LEAVE LATER ON FIND OUT THAT THESE ARE
NOT REALLY THE KIND OF PROMISES THAT THEY HURT SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CALL IT VOLUNTARY YOUR NUTS A LOT OF THESE GIRLS JUST DISAPPEAR THEY'RE NOT HEARD FROM HER
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING FORCED LABOUR WHAT SORT OF SCALE DO YOU THINK THAT'S ONE UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA
HOW MANY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF WORK IT HAPPENS IN SUCH A MICHAEL LEVEL
SEEMS LITTLE VILLAGES LITTLE FAMILIES HER COUSIN WENT AND THEY SAID THAT ALL COME HERE THERE MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN THE WAY DON'T YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS NUMBER
AND THEN ANOTHER PERSON IN THE VILLAGE DID THE SAME THING SAID SO ON DOCTOR LANDING THANK YOU
IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE B.B.C.'S COVERAGE OF MIGRATION WHICH WILL BE THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON RADIO FOUR YOU CAN USE THE HASHTAG WORLD ON THEM
BRING UP A LOT OF THIS
THERE ARE TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT MIGRATION OF COURSE TALK ABOUT OTHER STORIES THIS MORNING IT WASN'T A BOMB IT WASN'T EVEN A HOAX HE DID HOWEVER LEAD TO THE EVACUATION OF SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM OLD TRAFFORD AND FEARS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OTHER MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS WERE JOINED ON THE LINE BY A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN MORNING TO YOU DAN WELL EXTRAORDINARILY EMBARRASSING THIS ISN'T IT THE REVELATION THAT THIS WAS POOR
AS PART OF THE SECURITY TEST SO THE FIRST MASS EVACUATION DONE EFFECTIVELY AS A RESULT OF AN ERROR IT IS HUGELY EMBARRASSING MAKE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT A PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHES ACTUALLY BEEN CANCELLED ON SECURITY GROUNDS I THINK THE INQUEST WILL BEGIN IN EARNEST TODAY AS TO HOW ON EARTH THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU SAY IT WAS A BLUNDER INITIALLY THERE WERE FEARS THIS COULD BE SOME KIND OF TERRORIST INCIDENT AND I'VE GOT A FEW HOURS LATER WE LEARNT THAT IT WAS AN ELABORATE HOAX
AND THEN FINALLY SEVEN HOURS AFTER THE ALARM WAS INITIALLY RAISED IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS DEVICE THIS VERY VERY LIFELIKE IMITATION BOMB DEVICE WAS A BIT LEFT OVER FROM A SECURITY DRILL THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AS LONG AGO AS WEDNESDAY SO SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR BOTH MANCHESTER UNITED AND THE PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM THEY USED TO CONDUCT THESE DRILLS WHY WAS THIS DEVICE LEFT OVER IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THE KNOT AND EVENTUALLY THAT HAD TO BE CHECKED OFF WHEN THESE DEVICES WHAT WERE PUT IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS FOR SNIFFER DOGS TO TRY AND FIND
WHY DID YOU THEN TAKE ALWAYS TIME BEFORE HE'S DISCOVERED IT IT LIE THERE IN THIS TOILET IN PART OF THE STADIUM FOR FOUR DAYS UNTIL IT WAS DISCOVERED SHORTLY BEFORE KICK OFF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND THEN WHY DID IT TAKE SEVEN HOURS DURING THE REST OF THE DAY BEFORE THAT THE TRUTH WAS REALISED WHEN YOU CONSIDER JUST HOW
HUGELY INCONVENIENCE WAS TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FANS WHO HAD MADE THE JOURNEY TO OLD TRAFFORD THE MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE COST IN TERMS OF POLICING THE HASSLE IT WOULD HAVE EVOLVED FOR A MILITARY AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND IT'S NO WONDER REALLY THAT THE INTERIM MARE IN THE POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSION FOR GREATER MANCHESTER TONY LLOYD HAS CALLED IT AN OUTRAGEOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE FIASCO AND HE'S DEMANDING
AN INQUIRY INTO WHAT HAPPENED IS IT CLEAR WHAT THE CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY IS A BEAN IT IS STRIKING THAT THE CLUB HAD CHOSEN TO SPELL OUT THAT IT WAS A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM ARE THEY SAYING IN EFFECT WELL NOT US WE DELEGATED TO THEM OF THE POLICE IN EFFECT SAY NOT US WE DELEGATED TO THE CLUB WHO DELEGATED TO THE PRIVATE FIRM WELL I COULD BE SOME CONSIDERATIONS OF COMPENSATION PERHAPS THAT ONCE AT PLAY HERE IN TERMS OF WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE HE WAS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE CERTAINLY BUT
THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS I THINK EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS A MISTAKE BY A BY A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM FOR THE CLUB AND THE CLUB'S HEAD OF SECURITY THE MANCHESTER UNITED HAS SAID THAT IT WILL BE PAYING COMPENSATION IN TERMS OF THE TICKET REFUND TO ALL THOSE FANS WHO WERE WERE MEANT TO BE THERE YESTERDAY AND THEY'LL MAKE IT BECAME AVAILABLE FOR FREE FOR ANYBODY STILL HAS A TICKET IT WOULD BE REPLAYED ON TUESDAY EVENING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK BUT OF COURSE IT DOESN'T
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TRAVEL COS THE ACCOMMODATION COST THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF FANS WOULD HAVE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THAT GAME I THINK IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS JUST THIS HEIGHTENED SENSE OF OF TENSION THAT EXISTS NOW ESPECIALLY AT FOOTBALL SINCE NOVEMBER'S PARIS ATTACKS BEGAN COURSE BEGAN WITH AN ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON ON A STADIUM IN THAT THAT FRIENDLY MATCH BETWEEN GERMANY AND SPAIN THAT NIGHT AND YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE APPREHENSION FOR ORGANISERS OF THE EUROS WHICH KICKS OFF IN IN JUST UNDER A MONTH'S TIME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE MAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF POLICE SECURITY AT THE OLYMPICS AFTER HE'S GOT THIS MORRISSEY WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THOSE FUTURE TOURNAMENTS

NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE WORLD AS WE TELL YOU HE'S ON THE MOVE MUCH OF IT IT MIGHT SEEM COMING TO LIVE NEAR YOU MIGHT SEEM THAT IF YOU LIVE IN NORTHERN EUROPE OF COURSE BUT WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE OF MIGRATION OVER DECADES AND ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD AND HOW DOES WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY COMPARE WITH OARS MICHAEL BLESS LINT CRATER READY FALLS MORE OR LESS PROGRAMME TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS
PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS RESTLESS OUT OF AFRICA THE WHOLE WORLD WAS POPULATED
AND NOW BEWARE ALL NUMBERS ARE UNCERTAIN
ONE RECENT STUDY ESTIMATED THE FLOW BETWEEN COUNTRIES OVER FIVE YEARS AS AT LEAST HALF A PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION ABOUT FIVE OR SIX PEOPLE IN EVERY THOUSAND
IS THAT BIG IF FIVE LIVE ABROAD AFTER FIVE YEARS OF NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DON'T
IF THE U.K. WAS THIS AVERAGE THAT'D BE ROUGHLY CARDIFF IN AND OUT EVERY FIVE YEARS OR MAYBE TWO YORKS
IS IT RISING POSSIBLY NOT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THIS GLOBAL AVERAGE HAS BEEN FAIRLY STABLE SAYS THAT STUDY
EVEN SO A STEADY FLOW LIKE THIS ADDS UP OVER TIME AND AROUND THE WORLD AS THE POPULATION ALSO GROWS TO A STOCK OF MAYBE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW LIVING IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
AND IF THE FLOW SOUNDS TOO LOW REMEMBER AGAIN THAT IT'S AN AVERAGE BROUGHT DOWN BY COUNTRIES WHERE RELATIVELY FEW PEOPLE COME AND GO IN CHINA AFTER FIVE YEARS MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT IN EVERY THOUSAND OF THAT COUNTRY'S VAST POPULATION WERE STILL IN CHINA
THE U.K. WELL ABOVE AVERAGE IN FIVE YEARS IT WASN'T ONE EXTRA CARDIFF HERE BUT ON THIS METHOD MORE LIKE FIVE OR SIX
ALSO ABOVE AVERAGE LEBANON WAR IN SYRIA ON ITS BORDER IF THE U.K. WERE A SCALED UP LEBANON WE'D HAVE SEEN A TOTAL INFLUX EQUAL TO ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED CARDIFF'S
OF THE HOT SPOTS HAVE INCLUDED MIGRANT LABOUR TO THE GULF ABOUT HALF THE POPULATION IN DUBAI ALL THE ROUGHLY ELEVEN MILLION MEXICANS WHO CURRENTLY LIVE IN THE U.S. BUT THESE HAVE NOW SLOWED SHARPLY WHILE THE PACE INTO NORTHERN EUROPE HAS RISEN
THAT'S PEOPLE MIGRATING ACROSS BORDERS BUT THERE'S ALSO INTERNAL MIGRATION IN CHINA PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LEAVE BUT THEY SURE WILL MOVE IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS IT CITIES HAVE SWOLLEN BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR CHINA SCALED TO THE U.K. IMAGINE A POPULATION SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF SCOTLAND AND WALES UPROOTING MOSTLY FOR LONDON
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT GLOBALLY ABOUT THREE MILLION PEOPLE MOVE TO CITIES SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD EVERY WEEK
A TINY PROPORTION OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION BUT ENOUGH TO FILL LEEDS ALMOST EVERY DAY
THESE ARE ROUGHLY THE NUMBERS THIS IS THE PATTERN A VAST SETTLED MAJORITY BY CHOICE OR OTHERWISE BUT WHERE THERE'S WAR DISEASE PERHAPS OR MAYBE THE DREAM OF A FAR BETTER FUTURE
CORRIDORS OF BUSTLE POCKETS OF TURMOIL AND BEHIND EVERY NUMBER OR LIFE
IN HOPE OR DESPERATION MICHAEL GLASS AND THERE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE NUMBERS AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK NOW IT IS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN
WE ALL THINK WE KNOW WHAT ELIZABETH THE FIRST LOOKS LIKE FEW MONARCHS HAVE BEEN BETRAYED MORE OFTEN ON FILM OR T.V. OR ON CANVAS BUT UNTIL NOW WE HAD NO SCRAP OF THE CLOTHES THAT SHE ACTUALLY WORE IN TILL NOW A RICHLY EMBROIDERED PIECE OF ALTAR CLOTH FROM HEREFORDSHIRE MIGHT JUST
BE THAT SCRAP IT'S TELL US ABOUT IT IS TRACEY BORMANN SHE JOINT CHIEF CURATOR AT THE HISTORIC ROYAL PALACES AND AUTHOR OF THE PRIVATE LIVES OF THE TUDORS OR PIECE OF ALTAR CLOTH HOW DID YOU KNOW TRACY THEY'RE NOT MY NOT BE THAT BUT IT MIGHT BE THE CLOTHING OF ELIZABETH THE FIRST I ACTUALLY CAME ACROSS THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MATERIAL A FEW YEARS AGO WHILE RESEARCHING MY BOOK ON THE PRIVATE LIVES OF THE TUDOR SO HOW THE TUDOR MONARCHS WERE DRESSED WHAT THEY ATE THEIR LIFE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS REALLY
AND I FOUND IT BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY AT BACTON CHURCH TO LOOK AT A MONUMENT TO ELIZABETH BY HER FAVOURITE LADY IN WAITING BLANCH PARIS AND THEN HAPPENED SEE THIS EXQUISITE PIECE OF MATERIAL ON THE WALL A NEW IT MUST BE SIGNIFICANT IT'S A VERY HIGH STATUS FABRIC CLOTH OF SILVER BEAUTIFUL EMBROIDERY WHY DO YOU THINK NO SIGNIFICANT ALTAR CLOTH
PASS POTENTIALLY THE CLOTHING OF A MONARCH WELL IT BEARS A REMARKABLE SIMILARITY TO THE DRESS THAT ELIZABETH WARES IN THE RAINBOW PORTRAIT OF AROUND SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND THE EMBROIDERY IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS CATERPILLARS STAGS IT'S ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE AND SO THROUGH MY WORK AT HISTORIC ROYAL PALACES I ALERTED THE DRESS
CURATOR THERE ELERI LYN HE DID SOME MORE RESEARCH WE'VE NOW GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF MATERIAL AT HAMPTON COURT IN OUR TEXTILE CONSERVATION STUDIO WHERE WE'RE DOING MORE ANALYSIS AND THAT ANALYSIS IS JUST STRENGTHENING THAT LITTLE IDEA THAT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY SO YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PORTRAIT YOU CAN DATE IT AS WELL PRESUMABLY WE CAN DATE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO CONFIRM THAT THIS IS INDEED A PIECE CLOTHING
I THINK JUST THE VERY FACT THAT WE KNOW IT IS ABSOLUTELY MADE OF CLOTH OF SILVER NOW THERE WERE LAWS THAT DICTATED THAT ONLY ROYALTY AND THE VERY HIGHEST MEMBERS OF SOCIETY COULD WEAR CLOTH OF SILVER AND SO I THINK IT'S A REALLY STRONG CASE FOR THIS BEING SUCH A RARE SURVIVOR NOW IF YOU DO AS IT WERE CONFIRMED THAT CASE OR AS MUCH AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY CONFIRM
WHAT ELSE WILL IT ALLOW YOU TO DO WHERE ELSE WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO IN THIS VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY WELL FOR A START IT ALLOWS TWO TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT WE HOPE IS AFTER A PROGRAMME CONSERVATION THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY PUT THIS DRESS AS I'M CONFIDENT IS SAYING IT IS ON DISPLAY TO VISITORS OF HAMPTON COURT AND THE OTHER HISTORIC ROYAL PALACES AND IT'S BEEN A JOY TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORY IN MY BOOK TREASURE NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT
IT'S NOW THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN NO IT IS SWELTERING HERE THIRTY FIVE DEGREES BUT THANKFULLY THERE IS A BIT OF BREEZE HERE IN MY MAKESHIFT ROOF TOPS STUDIO IN FISHERMEN CITY BY ALL ACCOUNTS HE'S BEEN PRETTY HOT THERE TWO STABBED AN AIR SEARCH CAN TELL US WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE

SO TODAY STARTING FOR ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A NICE START IN MANY PLACES QUITE CHILLY TOUCH OF FROST IN ONE OR TWO PLACES MIST AND FOG AROUND PARTICULARLY ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND AND WALES BUT AGAIN FOR MEN IT'S GOING TO BE A NICE DAY WITH SUNNY SPELLS THE BEST OF THEM ACROSS THE MIDLANDS SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND ACROSS SOUTH WHERE'S WILL BECOME FAIRLY WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE FIFTEEN TO MAYBE TWENTY CELSIUS BUT ALWAYS A BIT COOLER AND CLOUDIER SPOTS OR NEAR THE COAST FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A CLOUDY START FOR MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND FOR NORTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND WITH THE ODD PATCH OF LIGHT RAIN MORE PARTICULAR
FOR THE NORTH WEST HIGHLANDS CLOUD WILL TEND TO THIN AND BREAK THOUGH WHERE WHERE IT STARTED CLOUDY TO ALLOW FOR SUNNY SPELLS TO APPEAR QUITE WIDELY THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND FEELING QUITE WARM TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN TO MAYBE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS BUT NORTHERN SCOTLAND AND THE NORTHERN ISLES WILL TEND TO HOLD ONTO THE CLOUD WITH SPOTS OF RAIN AT TIMES AND IT WILL FEEL QUITE COOL TEMPERATURES OF TEN TO TWELVE CELSIUS

A GROUP OF M.P.S SAYS THERE'S BEEN A RAPID DETERIORATION OF SAFETY AND PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WITH SUICIDES HOMICIDES AND SERIOUS ASSAULTS OLE SOARING LAST YEAR BUT JUST AS COMMITTEE SAID THE SITUATION WAS OF GREAT CONCERN AND THAT IMPROVEMENT WAS URGENTLY NEEDED HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD
IN JUST ONE YEAR THE NUMBER OF HOMICIDES IN PRISON WHICH INCLUDES MURDERS AND MANSLAUGHTER WENT UP FROM FOUR TO SIX SUICIDES ROSE BY A QUARTER AND SERIOUS ASSAULTS ROSE BY A THIRD
COMPARED TO FIVE YEARS AGO HOMICIDES HAVE TRIPLED AND SUICIDES AND SERIOUS ASSAULTS HAVE DOUBLED TODAY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS JUSTICE COMMITTEE SAID IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT FURTHER ATTENTION IS PAID TO BRINGING PRISONS BACK ON THE FIRM OR CONTROL THE M.P. SAID THE PROBLEMS WERE DUE TO LEGAL HIGHS IN PRISON'S STAFF SHORTAGES AND MORE VIOLENT PRISONERS BUT THESE FACTORS ALL EXISTED A YEAR AGO SO DON'T FULLY EXPLAIN THE FURTHER DETERIORATION
THEY SAID THAT OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WAS THE FACT THAT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND NEW PRISON STAFF WERE RECRUITED LAST YEAR BUT STAFF NUMBERS WENT UP BY ONLY FOUR HUNDRED FORTY BECAUSE SO MANY PRISON OFFICERS ARE LEAVING

YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR CHIKU CANNA MASON WHO'S SEVENTEEN AND ATTENDS TRINITY CATHOLIC COMPREHENSIVE WON THE PRIZE AT THE BARBICAN IN CENTRAL LONDON LAST NIGHT THE JUDGES DESCRIBED HIS PERFORMANCE OF CELLO CONCERTO NUMBER ONE BY SHOSTAKOVICH AS SINCERE OR MOVING
OVERWHELMING I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY AND REALLY SURPRISED BUT YOU PYJAMAS THANK YOU TO EVERYONE I JUST REALLY ENJOYED THE
SO I WASN'T REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE COMPETITION
THE B.B.C.'S YOUNG MUSICIAN OF THE YEAR SHAKO CANNA MASON THANK YOU KATHY IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT IS THE STORY OF OUR TIMES THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SPREAD OF EASY COMMUNICATION CHEAP MOBILE PHONES AND INTERNET ACCESS THE FALL FIRST OF THE WALL THEN OF OTHER DESPOTIC REGIMES THE SPREAD OF WAR AND CONFLICT BETWEEN AND WITHIN COUNTRIES THE WORLD IS ON THE MOVE WHETHER IT'S TO VIETNAM OR TO MEXICO OR THE MEDITERRANEAN OR EASTERN EUROPE
I'M ACTUALLY IN ONE OF THE MOST ASTONISHING PLACES I'VE EVER BEEN AND I'M STANDING IN THE CENTRE OF A EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITY THAT THE GRAND ARCHITECTURE OF BUDAPEST AND YET I AM IN THE CENTRE OF
THE WORLD'S PRESUMABLY NEWEST REFUGEE CAMP HUNGARY'S PRIME MINISTER VICTOR OR BAN HAS MADE HIS FEELINGS PLAIN
AS EUROPE IS BEING OVER RUN BY MIGRANTS WHO ARE NOT KNOCKING AT THE DOOR MY BRAKING
THIS IS VERY TESTING I ACCEPT THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SWARM OF PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN SEEKING A BETTER LIFE WANTING TO COME TO BRITAIN FOUND AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY LAMB COULD BE DYED WITH HIS FIVE YEAR OLD BROTHER AND HIS MOTHER
JUST HOW DANGEROUS THESE JOURNEYS CAN BE COMING OUT ON THESE SMALL MINDS THE MIGRANTS ARE BACK IN THE OPEN OUT IN THE DEPOT
MAKE A PLANTS OF THE TRAWLER THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE THEM ON THERE ONE AND A HALF THOUSAND KILOMETRES ALL THE WAY
THE COAST OF THAILAND WHEN MEXICO SENTENCE PEOPLE DENIED SENDING THEIR BEST THEY'RE SENDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS
THEY'RE BRINGING THOSE PROBLEMS WERE THE HOUSE THEY'RE BRINGING DRUGS THEY'RE BRINGIN CRIME THEY'RE REDNESS AND SOME
I ASSUME ARE GOOD PEOPLE WE WAITED UNTIL NIGHTFALL THEY TOWED US GRADUALLY THEY TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS ONE BY ONE AND THEN WHEN THE SUN CAME UP THEY HAD LEFT
LOADING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN THERE IS A LESSON FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN HOW TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY
POOR MISGUIDED PEOPLE WHO FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS ONE A BETTER LIFE BUT WHO VERY OFTEN END UP
WORLD ON THE MOVE IS THE THEME OF THIS DAY OF SPECIAL B.B.C. PROGRAMMES A CHANCE FOR US TO SPEND JUST ONE DAY TALKING ABOUT WHAT ANGELINA JOLIE PITT DESCRIBES AS THE CHALLENGE OF A CENTURY SARAH IS PRESENTING THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING FROM VIETNAM AS YOU'VE HEARD I'VE BEEN JOINED HERE IN THE B.B.C. RADIO THEATRE AT BROADCASTING HOUSE BY A LIVE AUDIENCE WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW MIGRATION IS CHANGING OUR WORLD FOR BETTER AND FOR WORSE
WE'LL BE HEARING FRESH IDEAS NEW SOLUTIONS AND TAKING A TRULY GLOBAL LOOK AT THE STORY BEGINNING THIS OUR LISE DO SET OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND DAVID GOOD HEART DIE GREAT DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATION HUB AT THE POLICY EXCHANGE THINK TANK WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU PLEASE LET'S JUST BEGIN WITH THAT HEADLINE THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM SAVE THE CHILDREN KING THAT FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY HERE THE PRIORITY
IS AN EDUCATION WELL I DON'T THINK ANYONE LISTENING NO WHAT WOULD HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT KNOWING THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION WE SAY WE LIVE IN THE BEST OF TIMES AND WE LIVE IN THE WORST OF TIMES THE BEST BECAUSE NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A WORLD WHERE WE ARE SO CONNECTED SO WELL EDUCATED AND WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH WEALTH IN SOME PART OF THE WORLD AND YET WE LIVE IN THE WORST OF TIMES FOR THE AVERAGE TIME A REFUGEE IS OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY IS SEVENTEEN YEARS
THAT IS THE TIME OF AN EDUCATION SOME EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN ARE SAID TO BE REFUGEE CHILDREN NOW AND HALF OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL ANYONE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME WHO HAS CHILDREN WHO KNOWS CHILDREN AND EVERYBODY DIES WILL THINK IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION YOU HAVE REALLY NO FUTURE PROSPECTS AND THAT IS WAITING FOR CHILDREN HAS BUT WHAT HE'S ASKING US TO ALL CONCENTRATE OUR MINDS TO SAY THEY HAD NO REFUGEE CHILD SHOULD BE OUT OF SCHOOL
FOR MORE THAN A MONTH THERE'S HUGELY AMBITIOUS UNREALISTIC BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT A VISIBLE DAVID IS IT RIGHT IN YOUR VIEW THOUGH TO FOCUS ON HOW TO HANDLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ARRIVED HERE OR IS THERE A PRIOR QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING AS A NATION AS A CONSONANT ABOUT HOW WE STOP PEOPLE COMING IN
WELL YES I THINK THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE IN A WAY ISN'T IT HAVING WE DON'T WANT TO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE DESPERATE AT THE WORLD BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION NOT TO UNDULY DISRUPT POOR AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY TEMPTING PEOPLE HERE ONE MIGHT SAY WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE
HOLY UNBALANCED WORLD IN WHICH SO MANY OF THE MOST DYNAMIC AND BEST EDUCATED PEOPLE IN POOR COUNTRIES
FIND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN HAVE A DECENT LIFE IS BY GETTING THEMSELVES INTO INTO DEVELOPED EUROPEAN OR WESTERN COUNTRIES WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO OUR OWN SOCIETIES ARE CITIZENS OF OUR OWN SOCIETIES IMMUNE TO RETAIN COHERENT AND THEIR STABILITY AND TO THERE IS HERE A SORT OF CONFLICT IN THE WAY BETWEEN
THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP IN IN THE RICH WORLD THE MORE UNIVERSAL RITE OF
OF EVERYBODY ELSE AND YOUR FAIR SPEAKING AS SOMEONE FROM THE LEFT OF POLITICS HAS BEEN THAT UNCONTROLLED MIGRATIONS DISSOLVES THE GLUE THAT HOLDS WESTERN SOCIETIES TOGETHER YEAH I THINK IF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION REFUGEES WAS IT LAST YEAR IT SOUNDS LIKE A SMALL FIGURE BUT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THOSE SORTS OF CHANGES VERY QUICKLY BECOME
VERY LARGE INDEED AND IT'S ALSO NOT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE SPREAD AROUND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS PEOPLE OFTEN LIKE TO QUOTE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING AT ALL
TO THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN UNION ARE COMING TO CERTAIN ZONES LEARNS THERE ARE HOME TO SIXTY OR SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE AND YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY BUT I THINK THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENT IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO MESSY SO CHAOTIC WHY CAN'T WE ORGANISE REFUGEE FLOORS SO THAT THE COUNTRIES WHICH NEED PEOPLE TO COME IN WORK WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THEM IN ORDER OF Y. EM TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GENUINE FEAR OF PERSECUTION CAN FIND ASIDE
WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE PROGRAMME INDEED YOU GO TO THE B.B.C. WEBSITE IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE TO READ MORE AND INDEED I THINK SEE IT HERE IN THE B.B.C. RADIO THEATRE IN BROADCASTING HOUSE AND I THINK YOU COULD ALSO SEE SARAH IS ON THE LINE FROM HO CHI MIN CITY
THANKS NICK WELL IT'S QUARTER PAST SEVEN NOW AND ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE FLED VIETNAM AFTER THE WAR ENDED HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE
LIKE THE SYRIAN CRISIS THOUSANDS OF THEM TOOK TO THE SEA IN FLIMSY BOATS ACCORDED THE MIGRATION INSTITUTE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DIED AT SEA IN THAT
MANY OF THE CHILDREN OF THOSE WHO LEFT HAVE NOW CHOSEN TO RETURN AND ON THE BANKS OF THE SAIGON RIVER HERE IN HO CHI MIN CITY I SPOKE TO TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW IN THEIR THIRTIES LEFT AS BABIES BUT WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO COME
HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN AUSTRALIA SHE WAS JUST SIX MONTHS OLD WHEN HER FAMILY LEFT ON THE BOAT WHILE EH HE'S BRITISH AND ONLY RECENTLY DECIDED TO RETIRE
CAME BACK HERE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN JUST READY TO AT MY ROOTS AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ANSWER WHY MARGARET LONG FINGERNAILS WHY MY MUM WOULD SQUAT TO CHOP CHOCOLATE
REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT WHY I GREW UP TO BE A BIT DIFFERENT MAINLY WHAT ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS FLED FROM HERE TO AUSTRALIA WHAT WAS IT THAT BROUGHT YOU BACK WE WANT TO MOVE SO THAT OUR CHILDREN COULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW THE ENEMY'S CULTURA END HAD ANOTHER EXPERIENCE IN LIFE THAN JUST
IN AUSTRALIA YOU WROTE A FACEBOOK BLOB THAT WENT FAR
BECAUSE YOU COMPARED WHAT YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THE CURRENT REFUGEE CRISIS AND IT WAS A PARTICULAR PLAY FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE SHOULD BE
AS WELCOMING TO PEOPLE NOW AS THEY WERE TO YOU I WORK AT ONE WHEN I SAW A PICTURE OF A SMALL BOY IN THE SAND I FELT LIKE AN URGE TO DO SOMETHING
REACHED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I I WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT KNOWING I MADE A POSITIVE CHANGE NOW KNOW THAT ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE HAVE HAVE SEEN THAT POST AND THE GIST OF IT WAS LET THESE PEOPLE COME
ABSOLUTELY IT WASN'T READY TO PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT IT WAS TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL LIVING EVIDENCE THAT LAND REFUGEE
IS A POSITIVE THING YET THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF PEOPLE SAY LOOK THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAT WAS THE SEVENTIES THE EIGHTIES WHEN YOU WERE ARRIVING NOW THAT THEY BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARRIVED RECENTLY
THE U.K. IS BURSTING AT THE SEAMS THEY MIGHT SAY I STILL STAND BY WHAT I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN IN A BED MORE HUMAN
WE SHOULD HELP OUR FELLOW MAN WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE TO THE POST SOME PEOPLE SAID ALL RIGHT I'D MUCH RATHER LET
TWENTY THOUSAND VIETNAMESE MESSAGES ANY DAY OVER SO IN A PRODUCE FOR ME THAT WAS QUITE BUT AND I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF MAYBE ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT
NINETY PER CENT WAS REALLY POSITIVE WE'RE COMPETING WITH THE SOUND OF THE BOATS ON THE RIVER SAIGON
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE CURRENT REFUGEE CRISIS IT'S BOATS CARRY
VERY SMALL CHILDREN AND IT'S SOME JUST BABIES AND MAINLY I KNOW YOU WERE IN THAT SITUATION COS YOU WERE SIX MONTHS WHEN YOUR MOTHER DECIDED TO TAKE YOU WENT TO HAVE YOUR OLDER SIBLINGS ON A BOAT THE DAY THAT SHE LEFT SHE DIDN'T GET TO SAY GOODBYE
BY DAY THREE WE HAD MADE IT TO MALAYSIA AND MY BROTHER WHO WAS SIX THE ONLY SAT THERE TALKING ABOUT THE STORY ONCE IT WAS TOO EARLY I THINK IT WAS STILL QUITE TRAUMATISED HE REMEMBERED PEOPLE SHOOTING MACHINE GUNS INTO THE AIR
AND MY MUM FRANTICALLY TIME EMPTY WATER BOTTLES I'M TWICE AS FLOTATION DEVICES BUT ALL HE COULD THINK OF
HOW IS THIS GOING TO STOP THE BULLETS THEY WERE BASICALLY SCARING US SO THAT WE WOULDN'T JUMP OFF THE BOAT AND TRY AND DARK THEY FINALLY CALMED US DOWN BY OFFERING HER SOME FOOD AND WATER
A PLACE TO TELL WE WAITED UNTIL NIGHTFALL THEY TOWED US GRADUALLY THEY TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS ONE BY ONE AND THEN WHEN THE SUN CAME UP THEY HAD LEFT US LOADING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN
WE WERE JUST LEFT LOADING FOR IT A FEW MORE DAYS
ANOTHER SHIP WE WORKED OUT THAT THEY WANT TO HELP US AND THEY OFFERED TO TELL OUR BOATS SO WE WERE BEING TOWED FOR A WHILE THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMOTION GOING ON THE BAR PEOPLE WERE ANXIOUS AND FRANTIC NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE TOWING US SAID THE WIFE OF THE CAPTAIN OF SHIT CUT THE LINE
WE WERE LEFT FLOATING AGAIN DUDE AND WATER HAD RUN OUT
THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR A CAP FULL OF WATER IF THEY'RE MEANS AND MY MUM HAD ENOUGH TALK JUST WENT OUT
BY THIS TIME SHE'D ALREADY GIVEN UP HER TART SO THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO BE IN AT NIGHT SO THAT SHIPS WHEN IT CRASHING TO US SHE ONLY HAD THE CLOTHES ON HER BACK SO SHE WAS TOPLESS AND SHE'S USING ME TO SHIELD HERSELF ON THE BIKE WE INTO THAT MAKING IT INDONESIA
DAY THIRTEEN AND THAT ENDED UP BEING THE SECOND LAST PERSON TO JUMP OFF THE BAR
SO THEY THREW ALL THE CHILDREN OVERBOARD AND THEY WERE ADULTS IN THE WATER TO CATCH US BUT MUM WAS PETRIFIED
THE LAST PERSON ON THE BOAT WITH THE MAN SITTING NEXT TO HER HE'D PASSED AWAY COS HE COULDN'T COPE WITH THE JOURNEY
WHEN SHE FINALLY GOT OFF THE BOAT MEETS AND CRIED THE WHOLE TREE FEET TOUCH THE GROUND SHE JUST BROKE DOWN INSTEAD OF CRYING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DECISION THAT SHE TOOK A NEW UNDERSTANDING EVERY DAY I'M FOR HIM
WHEN I COME BACK AND I LOOK AT MY COUSINS AND THE SITUATIONS THEY AT THEY'RE IN THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE
MY MUM WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN SHE LEFT WITH HER THREE CHILDREN ON THE FIRST NIGHT SHE HAD ALREADY KISSED
THINKING THAT THE SHIP WOULD SINK I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION HERE
A FUTURE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE IF THE ESTATE WAS WORTH TAKING THAT RISK YOU BOTH TOLD ME EARLIER THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY REALISE YOU WERE REFUGEES AND TWO OF YOU WERE GROWN UP MY MUM NEVER SPOKE ABOUT IT MY UNCLE'S VOICE TRAUMATISED ABOUT IT I REALISE I WAS A REFUGEE WHEN I WAS TWELVE MY PARENTS NEVER USE
HI I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT WORD WAS IN THE ENEMY IS EITHER LATER IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A A FRIEND
WHO WAS SO SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS GIVEN THESE BECAUSE YOU SAID TO ME
I ONLY KNOW THE ENEMY'S AS PEOPLE WIN DONGS AND SINGLE IT'S LIKE THE ONES WE SAW ON THE NEW FOR BOTH OF YOU COMING BACK HERE WHAT'S THE RECEPTION BEEN LIKE FROM THOSE VIETNAMESE WHOOPS
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD IS THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO STAYED WHETHER BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH
DON'T FEEL THAT WELCOMING TO THOSE WHO LEFT SO WE ARE THE QUEUE WHICH MEANS OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE
AGAINST DON'T LIKE MIXED REVIEWS I THINK THE FIRST GENERATION WOULD COME BACK HERE WHEN
COMMUNITIES AND THEY WERE WELCOME IN ITALY WITH MY RELATIVES HIS REMAINS IN VIETNAM THAT WAS SORT OF AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU WOULD HELP THEM OUT FINANCIALLY BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO DO SO WOULD BE INTO THAT SPONSORING ONE OF MY COUSINS OVER TO AUSTRALIA AND PUT INTO A UNIVERSITY BOTH OF YOU THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT HO
STANDING HERE AT THE CITY THE COUNTRY THAT YOUR PARENTS CAME FROM THERE REALLY ISN'T
WHAT DOES IT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT TIES TO COUNTRY AND PATRIOTISM I SUPPOSE IT'S NOTHING TO BE PROUD OFF IF YOU'RE FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP
I THINK IS WHAT YOU DO FOR A COUNTRY IT'S POTLUCK THAT YOU'RE BORN IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY YOU WERE DOTS THAT NATIONALITY
THE CITIZENSHIP TO ME WHEREVER MY FAMILY IS I KNOW THAT WE CAN MAKE IT A HOME FOR US MAINLY TAP WALLY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN TWENTY TWO MORE BUSINESSES ARE WRITING TO MORE NEWSPAPERS TO TELL US WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THE REFERENDUM THE REFERENDUM OF COURSE
ON BRICKS IT WITH THAT MORTON BUSINESS NEWS HE'S ROBIN YES THANK YOU NO POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SEVERAL OPEN LETTERS FROM BUSINESS LEADERS SUPPORT ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER THIS MORNING THREE HUNDRED SIX COMPANY BOSSES HAVE WRITTEN TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THEY SAY THE U.K.'S COMPETITIVENESS IS BEING UNDERMINED BY OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AND THEY SAY THAT BRUSSELS RED TAKE STIFLES EVERY COMPANY IN THE COUNTRY WILL WITH US IT'S JOHN LONG WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF VOTES LEAVE BUSINESS COUNCIL AND THE FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING THIS LETTER SAYS THE U.K.'S COMPETITIVENESS IS BEING UNDERMINED AND YET ACCORDING TO THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM WE ARE THE WORLD'S TENTH MOST COMPETITIVE NATION SOME PRETTY GOOD YES BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE A BURDEN OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF REGULATOR IT COST EACH YEAR
WHICH ARISES FROM BRUSSELS AND WE ALSO HAVE A CHARGE OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK ALL OF WHICH HAS TO BE BORNE BY THE TAX PAYER IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY MATES BUSINESSES THAT EXPORT ONLY TO THE REST OF THE WORLD OR OPERATE THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY
UNCOMPETITIVE BUT WITHOUT ANY OF THE BENEFITS SUCH AS THEY ARE OF BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUND FIGURE WAS DISPUTED BUT WE WILL PUT THAT TO ONE SIDE FOR NOW IF YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE THREE HUNDRED SIX COMPANIES EXPORT
QUITE A LOT OF THEM ACTUALLY A MEETS VERY INTERESTING FOR EXAMPLE MY OLD FIRM THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE PRODUCED A REPORT THIS RECENTLY INDICATING THAT THERE'D BEEN A SHIFT IN
OPINION OF MEMBERSHIP TOWARDS THE LEAF CAMPAIGN BUT WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE SURVEY IS THAT THEY LOOKED AT BUSINESSES THAT ONLY OPERATE IN THE U.K. AND THEY ALL SALUTE TO BUSINESSES THAT ONLY EXPORT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
IN THOSE TWO GROUPS THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES BY FAR WANTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE SURVEY OVERALL THOUGH MOST BUSINESS I SAID THEY WANTED TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THOSE TWO GROUPS REPRESENT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF U.K. BUSINESSES AND EIGHTIES EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE U.K. ECONOMY BECAUSE ONLY THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO THE I.N.S. FIGURES ACTUALLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPORTS TO EUROPE SO WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS ONE ALL THE BIGGEST BUSINESS SURVEYS ON THE SUBJECT IS THAT NOW THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES IN THE U.K. WANT TO LEAD
THERE REMAIN SIDE OF PUBLISHED LETTERS FROM BUSINESS LEADERS AS WELL DO YOU THINK THEY MAKE THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF DIFFERENCE TO UNDECIDED VOTERS AND HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR VOTERS TO DECIDE ON THE FAX WHICH WAY TO JUMP PEOPLE SAY TO ME IF YOU'RE UNDECIDED I TEMP QUITE FRIGHTENED ABOUT THIS DECISION SO WHAT I'M SAYING TO PEOPLE IS THIS
USE THE OLD ADAGE JUDGE THE PEOPLE BY THE COMPANY THEY KEEP
THE PRIME MINISTER IS CAMPAIGNING TO TO REMAIN IS KEEPING THE COMPANY OF EUROPEAN TECHNOCRATS WHOSE PENSIONS AND PAY POWER AND POSITION DEPENDS ON YOUR OPINION
OUR GROUP HAS PEOPLE WHO'VE RISKED THEIR OWN CAPITAL TO SET UP BUSINESSES AND CREATE JOBS
ALONG WITH EACH OTHER OF THE WEEKLY BUSINESS COUNSEL THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL BEATS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW CONFESS ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE YOU THOUGHT THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST WAS SIMPLY THREE HOURS OF CAMP AND SEQUINS AND BAD SINGING

DIGITAL CRASH AND ON TOP OF THAT THAT'S TWELVE RESIGNATIONS A HUNDRED FIFTY COACHES SO THAT'S ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES
PRETTY PRETTY STUNNING AND OF THE FIFTY FOUR MANAGES ONLY FIVER ACTUALLY BACK IN WORK SO THIS IS THE WORST SEASON EVER IT IS THE WORST SEASON EVER YES WHY DID CLUBS THINK SACKING MARRIAGES IS THE ANSWER
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE THESE DAYS NOT ONLY ON THE THE MANAGERS IN THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS BUT ALSO THE OWNERS AND THE EXECUTIVES RUNNING THE CLUB THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MEDIA THE INSTANT RESULTS STRIVE FOR PROMOTION AND AVOIDING RELEGATION BUT YOU JUST NEED THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE CLUBS TO TAKE A STEP BACK TO ASSESS

JUST MANAGING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VAN I INTERVIEWED SAM ALLARDYCE THE SUNDERLAND MANAGER YESTERDAY HE'S ONE OF ONLY THREE ENGLISH MANAGERS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND HE SAID HE CAN SEE A TIME WHEN THERE'LL BE NO ENGLISH MANAGERS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE SO MANY CLUBS HAVE FOREIGN OWNERS OF COURSE DO YOU THINK HE COULD BE RIGHT NO ENGLISH MANAGERS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BRITISH MANAGERS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT BUT THEY CERTAINLY RIGHT TO BRING IT UP
WE'VE GOT SEAN DOSH COMING UP AND THREE OF THE FOUR MANAGERS IN THE PLAY OFFS ARE ALSO ENGLISH BUT WE HAVE FIFTY THREE ENGLISH MANAGERS SIXTY SEVEN BRITISH AND I THINK WE HAVE A VERY TALENTED KNOWLEDGEABLE AND PASSIONATE MANAGERS AND COACHES THERE AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE INVEST IN THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SO WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES COME ABOUT THEY CAN TAKE THEM THAT'S ALL VERY WELL BUT OF COURSE IT IS HER RESULTS BUSINESS UP THERE IN YOUR VIEW HOW MUCH TIME SHOULD MANAGERS BE GIVEN
THAT WAS A GOOD QUESTION I WOULD SAY A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS AND WHAT WHAT'S THE WIDER IMPACT OF CONSTANT THE CONSTANT TURNOVER OF MANAGERS RICHARD BUT IF WE CAN IMAGINE THE PEOPLE LISTENING TO THE RADIO PUT THE READY APPROACHING THIS MORNING DRIVING TO WORK DRIVING TO BUSINESSES AND IF YOU HAD TO SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN THEIR BUSINESS EVERY EIGHT TO TEN MONTHS IF YOU THINK OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIRTY EIGHT MANAGERS AND HE'S ACTING IN INTO SEASONS

WELCOME TO DREAM PLAQUES I'M TENSE OWING INTO SPACE YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THE COMMON AREA WE'RE IN HER OFFICE SPACE WITH MAYBE THIRTY FORTY PEOPLE IN BUT PLENTY MORE CHAIRS WHERE PEOPLE COULD BE USING THE SPACE ABSOLUTELY SO ON A BUSY DAY YOU YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TO ANY HUNDRED FORTY PEOPLE
WE HAVE THREE FLOOR SO WE TAKE UP TEN WIN IS GIVING ME A TOUR OF DREAM PLEX HIS COUP WORKING SPACE IT LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF TRENDY OPEN PLAN OFFICE YOU'D FIND IN SILICON VALLEY THERE'S EVEN A GAMING ROOM
THIS OFFICE BLOCK IS IN HO CHI MIN CITY TIN SET IT UP TO GIVE ENTREPRENEURS SOMEWHERE TO WORK FOR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THEY NOT ONLY HAVE A DESK SPACE AND SHARED KITCHEN BUT THE BENEFITS OF CHATTING TO OTHERS WHO HAVE BIG DREAMS ABOUT WHAT THEIR FUTURE COULD BE HERE AND TINT THINKS HE'S HIT UPON A GROWING
TWO YEARS AGO AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN ANOTHER LOCATION AT OPEN BOTH WAS QUICKLY CLOSE BECAUSE I THINK THE TIMING WAS JUST NOT RIGHT WHAT'S CHANGED IN VIETNAM IN THE LAST
THIS WHEN YOU HAVE THIS INFLUX OF FOREIGN INTEREST LOCAL TALENTS TO HIS ALL TIED TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS BOON THAT IS CURRENTLY A BIT OF RE START UPS
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE IF A GRAPHIC CHART FOR YOU ISN'T IT
WHICH SHOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF IT IS SO WE HAVE SORT OF A SCENT
OR A BIT OF ME IS FROM OVERSEAS WE HAVE A TWELVE PERCENT WERE FROM THE U.S. WHICH IS GREAT AND WE'RE ABOUT TWO PER CENT JAPANESE COMING BACK AND CONTRIBUTING TO A CAR COMMIE IS A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO DISS
IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THIS COUNTRY THAN RETURNING MANY LEAVE TO GET AN EDUCATION OR DEGREE THERE ARE FOUR MILLION VIETNAMESE LIVING IN OTHER COUNTRIES
AND SOME OF THOSE COMING BACK NOW A SECOND GENERATION COMING BACK TO THEIR PARENTS' HOME NOT FOR THE TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES OF THIS COUNTRY BUT FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JOBS THE KIND THAT BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET COULD TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
JESS HELSTON GREW UP IN AUSTRALIA BUT TOLD ME WHY SHE CHOSE VIETNAM WON AT THE COST OF LIVING IS MUCH CHEAPER TO PENNY ALL VIABLE THE CITY IS IT'S CONTAGIOUS
IN SAIGON THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S LIKE EVERYONE'S HUSTLING IS EITHER MAKE OR BREAK FOR THE HUSTLE IS GOOD IT'S CONTAGIOUS
YOUR MOTHER LEFT VIETNAM MANY YEARS AGO DURING THE WAR
HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT YOU COMING BACK SHE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A REAL JOB RATHER THAN HAVE A PHOTO
DID YOU MIND THAT YOU WERE COMING BACK SHE HITS THIS SHIELD WHICH ARE RATHER MEAN
BUT FOR YOU IT'S ONE THING THE BUSINESS BUT WHY HERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SHE FLED HERE PRESUMABLY BECAUSE SHE WAS FEARFUL SO FOR YOU TO COME BACK DID IT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE COMING
HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE HOME I THINK THERE'S JUST SO MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU LIKE WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET AND HE I SEE OPPORTUNITIES
THAT'S THE SURPRISING THING WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE MIGRATING FOR THE SECURITY OF A JOB AND A STABLE LIFE BUT WHAT'S LURING SOME PEOPLE BACK HERE IS THIS SENSE OF OPPORTUNITY WHAT JESS CALLS THE HUSTLE THAT COMES FROM A RAPIDLY CHANGING ECONOMY WHAT IS NOT CHANGING HERE IS THE POLITICS IT IS STILL THE SAME REGIME THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM
BILL HAYDEN WAS A B.B.C. CORRESPONDENT HERE AT ITS CORE VIETNAM ISN'T DEEPLY COMMUNIST SOCIETY ITS LENINIST THROUGH AND THROUGH AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO STAY THAT WAY IN MANY WAYS BUT THE IMPERATIVE OF FINDING JOBS FOR A MILLION NEW YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE EVERY YEAR HAS FORCED THEM TO REFORM THE ECONOMY AND WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE FLED VIETNAM FEARFUL FOR THEIR LIVES BUT WHO ARE NOW COMING
AND THERE ARE SOME VERY FAMOUS EXAMPLE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER'S DAUGHTER MARRIED SOMEBODY WHOSE PARENTS FLED TO UNITED STATES BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE LIKE THEM ARE COMING BACK THESE PEOPLE OF STUDIES IN AMERICAN BUSINESS SCHOOLS THEY'VE GOT ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO HENRY TO FORM BONUSES SON IN LAW HE GOT THE FRANCHISE TO RUN MCDONALD'S BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE REALISING THIS IS VIETNAM IS JUST WIDE OPEN FOR PEOPLE WE'VE GOT A BIT OF TALENT
HOW COMFORTABLE IS IT IT'S STILL COMMUNIST AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY FOUGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER BUT A VERY DIFFERENT IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM THOSE ITEMS IN THEIR POSITIONS ARE STILL RAW AND SHARP AND THE COMMUNISTS ARE DETERMINED NOT TO ALLOW PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA BACK INTO THE COUNTRY SO IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE COMMUNISTS WE HAVE TO AGREE TO KEEP SILENT
THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THE MADNESS OF THE TRAFFIC HERE IN THE SUFFOCATING HEAT OF HOOCHIE IN CITY IS TO GO WITH THE FLOW
AND RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE CITY AND DISTRICT ONE IS WHERE THE POSH SHOPS
LIKE THE MARBLE FRONTED LOUIS RI TORR SHOP THAT'S TOWERING OVER ME
WITH ME HERE IS FRANK
FRANK YOU WERE AIRLIFTED OUT OF THE CITY ON AN AMERICAN HELICOPTER
WHEN YOU WERE JUST NINE YEARS OLD WE LEFT VIETNAM A FEW DAYS IF I LIBERATION
I ALWAYS HAVE THE DREAM UP LIKE COMING BACK TO VIETNAM AND HELP BUILD THE HOUSE THEY DID THIS IN THE END
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO I WAS SENT BACK MY COMPANY TO REALISE MY DREAM WE HEARD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
HAD TO SORT OF RECONCILE THEMSELVES TO THE GOVERNMENT
IN ORDER TO COME BACK AND WORK FREELY DID YOU FI
ACTUALLY I CAME BACK AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUE CAME BACK AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS OPENED A POLICY ESPECIALLY IN WELCOMING
VIETNAMESE EXPERT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT'S BRINGING PEOPLE BACK HERE FOLLOWED WITH A PRIMER WE WON IS
IS THAT A PART OF THE THAT AVAILABLE IN VIETNAM SO IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR A START UP THE BEST BLESSED DO EXECUTE UP IDEA IS
NO WONDER HIS TITLE AT MICROSOFT VIETNAM IS CHIEF EVANGELIST THAT WORD OPPORTUNITY IS ONE WE'VE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOT JUST FROM THOSE WITH VIETNAMESE HERITAGE
AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE DREAM PLEX CLUE WORKING SPACE HAVE A BEER WHEN I SPOKE TO AN AMERICAN JOHN MYERS HE'S A SOFTWARE DESIGNER
WHEN I ASKED IF HE WAS MAKING MONEY HE JUST GRINNED HE CAME TO VIETNAM ON HOLIDAY FOUR YEARS AGO AND DECIDED TO STAY WHEN HE REALISED ITS POTENTIAL
DESCRIBE THE SOUTH EAST ASIA SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY'S AND AT THE AGE OF THIRTY YOU KNOW TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE BACK IN AMERICA LIKE IN THEIR TWENTIES IN AT HER KIDS AT THE SCHOOL FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP ASKED ME ABOUT THEIR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT AND WHERE THEY CAN GET IT
YOU CREATE YOUR OWN JOB THAT SCRIPT THAT YOU ARE WIRED FOR STARTING A NEW SCRIPT VIETNAM ITSELF IS LIKE THIS
OR START UP BEING POWERED BY WHAT I WAS TOLD MANY TIMES IS THE FASTEST AND CHEAPEST INTERNET ACCESS ANYWHERE ON SOUTH EAST ASIA MORE THAN FORTY MILLION OR VIETNAM'S NINETY MILLION POPULATION ARE NOW ON LINE THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY'S FIFTH LARGEST CITY DENYING HAS FREE WHY FI
THE GOVERNMENT WHICH STILL SENSORS PEOPLE AND SIGHTS AND HAS INSISTED WE HAVE A MINDER WITH US HERE WHO'S FOREWARNED OF EVERY INTERVIEW HAS AT LEAST GIVEN UP TRYING TO RUN THE COMPANIES BEHIND THE INTER
AS USUAL IT'S A BIT OF YOU GUYS I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD WEEK
THERE'S ALWAYS MANY MORE VIA INTERNET PROVIDERS HAVE GONE A LONG WAY BUT IT'S MAINLY DRIVEN BY PRIVATE SECTOR'S I'M SURE THE TELL COURSE I'VE BEEN
THAT REALLY PUSHES TO THE NEXT LEVEL UP IS NOW THEY'RE COMPETING ON BASICALLY GOOD PRODUCTS THAT'S AS A TREND NOW OLIVER TELL CORBOULD ORDER STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES
PRIVATISE I THINK THE WHOLE MARKET IS BENEFITED NOT THAT THE VIENNESE WAY RIGHT
IN ENDING THAT REPORT FROM HERE IN POACHING IN CITY AND IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND MANY OF THEM HAVE THE MANCHESTER UNITED BOMB HOAX ON THEIR FRONT PAGES RED FACES IS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN
INSIDE THE PAPER THERE'S A TWO PAGE SPREAD EXPLAINING THAT THE FAKE DEVICE HAD BEEN LEFT TAPED TO THE DOOR OF A TOILET CUBA
SUN INTERVIEWS ONE OF THE MASCOTS FOR YESTERDAY'S MATCH AGAINST BOURNEMOUTH A BOY NAMED ALEXANDER BOO
HE DESCRIBES HOW WHEN THE ALARM WAS RAISED HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE PITCH WHILE HIS PARENTS WERE IN THE STANDS
MY WHOLE BODY WAS SHAKING AND I WAS PRETTY WORRIED HE TELLS THE PAPER SAYING HIS PANIC WAS WORSENED BY THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BECAME SEPARATED AS PEOPLE LEFT
DUMMY BOMB BLUNDERS THE HEADLINE IN THE MIRROR WHICH DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED AS A PREMIER LEAGUE FARCE IT HAS AN EDITORIAL COLUMN WRITTEN BY A SECURITY EXPERT
HE SUGGESTS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ALERT WAS BOGUS ON THIS OCCASION THE INSTEAD AS ONCE AGAIN HIGHLIGHTED WHAT HE CALLS THE SPECTRE OF TERRORISM AHEAD OF THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN FRANCE ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES VOLKSWAGEN IS TO BE SUED BY ONE OF ITS BIGGEST SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE OF THE EMISSION SCANDAL
THE PAPER SAYS NORWAY'S SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND IS THOUGHT TO HAVE LOST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS SINCE THE GERMAN CAR FIRM ADMITTED LAST YEAR THAT HE'D INSTALLED SECRET SOFTWARE TO CHEAT U.S. EXHAUST GAS TESTS
AND FINALLY THE TELEGRAPH HAS DETAILS OF AN UNLICENSED OUTDOOR DANCE PARTY AT THE WEEKEND NEAR THE SOMERSET TOWN OF FROME THE PAPER SAYS THEY WERE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM RESIDENTS WHO COULDN'T SLEEP BECAUSE THE LOUD MUSIC ITS LEADER COLUMN AGREES WITH ONE TWITTER USER WHO SUGGESTED THAT ANNOYED LOCALS
SHOULD HAVE SIMPLY GONE TO THE RAVE IS QUOTED SAYING THAT A FEW HUNDRED MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE DOING DAD DANCING SHOULD HELP TO CLOSE IT DOWN THE HEADLINE DON'T RANT
RAVE THAT IS THE ANSWER WILL SOON HUMPHRIES ME MILLION WEB
EMBARRASS THEM ALL ON THE NEXT OCCASION IT'S A QUARTER TO EIGHT THIS AFTERNOON RADIO FOUR WILL BE BROADCASTING A SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED DRAMA BY THE PLAYWRIGHT JAMES GRAHAM PERFORMED LIVE RIGHT HERE IN THE RADIO THEATRE AT BROADCASTING HOUSE IN LONDON THERE IS THE VOICES YOU'RE HEARING THE VOICES OF THE AUDIENCE IN THE BACKGROUND ALL PART OF THE SPECIAL WORLD ON THE MOVE DAY DURING WHICH WE EXAMINE HOW THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IS CHANGING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND HOW OUR ECONOMIES DEVELOP THE PERFORMANCE IS GOING TO BE PUT ON BY THE PLAYWRIGHT
JAMES GRAHAM WHO JOINS ME NOW LIVE IN THE RADIO THEATRE JAMES MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT MIGRATION USUALLY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE EITHER OF THE MIGRANT THEMSELVES OR INDEED OF THE HOST COMMUNITY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING RATHER DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY I THINK WHEN YOU'RE FAT WHEN YOU'RE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE A STORY TO SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS WHAT'S HAPPENING GLOBALLY IN TERMS OF MIGRATION BUT YOU YOU YOU'RE THE FIRST QUESTION YOU ASK AS A WRITER IS
WHAT WHAT'S MY MIND THE AUDIENCES IN THERE HOW DO WE GET I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMPREHEND THE NEW WANTS SITUATION IT'S HAPPENING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S YOU'VE GOT FOURTEEN MINUTES AND IT'S LIVE SO I THINK POLITICAL DRAMA IS VERY GOOD AT MAKING THINGS THAT'S FEEL FAR AWAY CLOSE IN FOR POLITICAL PERSONAL SO WE'VE GONE FOR A DOMESTIC STORY RATS HAVE INCREDIBLY HIGH RATE OF DOMESTIC MIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY COMPARED WITH OUT INTO THAT EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS
AND ACTUALLY MOST OF THOSE ARE PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION ARE QUITE YOUNG SO WE'RE TELLING A STORY AND ASKING HER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE MOVE WHAT WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY MOVE THIS CITY WERE TELLING A STORY OF A YOUNG COUPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP IN LONDON IN THE THIRTIES FORCED OUT BY THE HOUSING CRISIS LOOKING FOR JOBS AND PROSPECTS ELSEWHERE IN A SENSE WE WERE TRYING TO CAPTURE IS THE MIGRATION HERE AND ROUND THE WORLD IS NOT ALL THAT IS ABOUT PEOPLE COMING FROM TERRIBLE WAR TORN ZONES TO RICH AREAS IT IS OFTEN SIMPLY THAT
THE MOVEMENT OF BEEP EXEC EXACTLY THAT AND ACTUALLY THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FOR FOR WORK IS A BRITISH INVENTION OF BEGAN AN INDUSTRY REVOLUTION AND WE CONTINUE THAT TRADITION EVER SINCE AND OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE NOT SAYING IN A WAY THAT THEY DID THEIR STRUGGLES FOR POKER FACED BY A GENERATION OF YOUNG LONDON ISN'T IT IN ANY WAY COMPARABLE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SYRIA WE ARE ON THE CONTINENT BUT I THINK IT'S A HELPFUL WAY YES TASS THAT'S QUESTIONS WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY LEAVE YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR FAMILY AND ACTUALLY THERE'S A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALL OF US I THINK THINGS LIKE WE ARE
THINKING OF COMMUNITY WERE DIFFERENT THEY WERE THINKING OF LOCAL IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OFTEN PEEP PEOPLE TEENAGERS YOUNG PEOPLE THINK OF THEIR COMMUNITY IS NOT NECESSARILY IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHY BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR FRIENDS ON TWITTER THERE FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK I THINK WE'RE HAVING A BIT DIFFERENT VIEW OF WHAT LOCAL LOCUM WHAT CLOSE NAMES NOW YOU'RE STILL WRITING SOME AND IT'S GOING TO BE PERFORMED IS THE ACT OF WRITING AS YOU DO CHANGING THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT
GOT A QUESTION ACTUALLY YES OH I'M SO THE WAY WE WORK AND WILL BE HERE ON THE STAGE IN A FEW HOURS TIME AND I SHOULD REALLY BE RIGHT TO GET HER NOT SORTS TODAY TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF ACTORS AND YES OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE IN A REHEARSAL ROOM WITH A DIRECT YOU WITH ACTORS BUT HAVE THE JOY OF BEING A COLLABORATOR AND A THEATRE MAKERS THAT YOU GET TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS WHEN YOU'RE WRITING THEM SO YES I WAS UP LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING CHANGING THINGS RESPONDING TO THE NEWS FROM THIS MORNING AND HE'S TRYING TO MAKE IT FEEL LIKE IT'S CURRENT
WELL KAREN'S IT WILL BE AND WE'LL HEAR IT LIVE HERE ON RADIO FOUR AT TWO FIFTEEN JAMES GRAHAM YOU'VE MADE THAT I'M SURE YOU WILL BECAUSE OF THIS HOUSE BRILLIANT DRAMA THAT'S RETURN INTO THE WEST END LATER IN THE YEAR YOU MAY HAVE ALSO FOR THE COALITION DRAMA THE BOAT DRAMA ON CHANNEL FOUR IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME NOW IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT O'CLOCK AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOR FOR THEIR DO APOLOGISE IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT O'CLOCK AND IT IS OF COURSE TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER WITH ME HERE IN THE RADIO THEATRE THIS MONEY'S JANE LEACH THE PRINCIPLE OF WESLEY HOUSE THE METHODIST COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
PERHAPS THIS WEEKEND YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING THE ANNUAL EUROVISION BUBBLE OR PERHAPS YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING IT
EITHER WAY HE WOULD HAVE DONE WELL TO EVADE IT COMPLETELY GIVEN THE EVER MORE COMPLEX BUILD UP AND THE POLITICAL OVERTONES OF UKRAINE'S VICTORY ON SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A SONG ABOUT THE DEPORTATION OF CRIME INTO TASK BY STALIN IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR
IN ONE WAY AT LEAST FOR THE BRITISH EUROVISION IS A BUBBLE AN ANNUAL OPPORTUNITY TO INDULGE IN THE LIGHT HEARTED MOCKERY OF A MORE SERIOUS MINDED NEIGHBOURS AND TO BE NOSTALGIC FOR THE DAYS OF SANDIE SHAW WHEN THE COMPETITION WAS SIMPLER AND WE HAD ANY HOPE OF WINNING IT LIKE ANY CULTURAL EVENT HOWEVER EUROVISION IS INTERESTING TO STUDENTS OF ANTHROPOLOGY FOR ON SUCH RITUALISED OCCASIONS WE CAN SEE THE PATTERNS OF OUR POLITICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE REFLECTED AS IN A MIRROR
ALL RATHER REFRACTED AS IN A PRISON IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE ISSUES COME INTO DIFFERENT FOCUS THE STYLE OF THE SONGS AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN LOCAL AND MORE GLOBAL GENRES THE CONFLICTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF EUROPEAN VALUES AND RELIGIOUS INHERITANCES AND ATTITUDES TO GENDER AND SEXUALITY
EVEN THE QUESTION OF WHICH NATIONS CAN COMPETE HE'S REVEALING CAN AUSTRALIA REALLY BE A PERMANENT PART OF THE COMPETITION ON THE GROUNDS OF ITS CULTURAL AFFINITY TO EUROPE AND WHOSE IDEA OF EUROPE AT THAT
IN A BOOK CALLED MUSIC NATIONALISM IN THE MAKING OF THE NEW EUROPE CHICAGO UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF MUSIC AND THE HUMANITIES PHILIP BOWMAN MAKES THE ARGUMENT THAT THE ROLE OF SONG IN THE BUILDING OF EUROPE IS NOTHING NEW IN TRACING THE HISTORY HOWEVER HE MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CONTRIBUTION OF MUSIC TO NATIONAL IDENTITY AND TO NATIONALISM
THE FIRST BEING A GIFT WE ARE GLAD TO SHARE WITH OTHERS THE SECOND BEING AN AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY TO DEFEND OUR OWN IDENTITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE IDENTITIES OF OTHERS
RELIGION AT ITS WORST REINFORCES SUCH TRIBAL BEHAVIOUR BUT AT ITS BEST IT HELPS HUMAN BEINGS TO STAY ATTACHED TO THE HUMANITY AND DIGNITY OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT LIKE US AS ROME WILLIAMS HAS COMMENTED AT THE START OF THIS CHRISTIAN AID WEEK VOLUNTEERS FROM TWENTY THOUSAND CHURCHES WILL BE WITNESSING TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE NEIGHBOURS EXIST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AS WELL
THIS HUMAN ABILITY TO IDENTIFY WITH THE PLIGHT OF ANOTHER HUMAN COMMUNITY REMOVED FROM OUR OWN IS PERHAPS PART OF THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE POPULAR VOTE ON SATURDAY NIGHT AS PEOPLE WERE TOUCHED BY MIND A SONG IN THE RUN UP TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM AS FEELINGS RUN HIGH IT WOULD BE GOOD WHATEVER WE THINK IS THE BEST PLATFORM FROM WHICH BRITAIN SHOULD OPERATE IN THE WIDER WORLD IF WE COULD STAY ATTACHED TO THE HUMANITY OF THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE AS WELL AS THE HUMANITY OF THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EUROPE AND BEYOND
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH JANE LEACH THE TIME NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE CANCER DRUGS FUND WAS CREATED TO DO JUST WHAT IT SAID ON THE LABEL TO FUND CANCER DRUGS WHICH THE N.H.S. MIGHT NOT NORMALLY BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR IT BYPASSED THE VALUE FOR MONEY TESS NORMALLY APPLIED TO NEW TREATMENTS BY NICE THE BODY WHICH DECIDES WHICH DRUGS AND TREATMENTS THE HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND CAN AFFORD TODAY FIFTEEN CANCER CHARITIES HAVE WRITTEN TO DAVID CAMERON
WARNING HIM NOT TO ABANDON THE IDEA HE LAUNCHED WHEN HE FIRST BECAME PRIME MINISTER I'M JOINED BY BARONESS DELLA'S MORE THAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BREAST CANCER NOW ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES TO A LETTER IN THE PAPERS TODAY AND ALSO TO DOCTOR RICHARD TALBOT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING BERNICE MORGAN
WHAT IS YOUR WORRY THAT ESSENTIALLY THE CANCER DRUGS FUND WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BYPASS NICE IS EFFECTIVELY GOING TO BE OVER CANCER DRUG FUND WAS SET UP BECAUSE THE NICE SYSTEM WASN'T WORKING FOR MODERN CANCER TREATMENTS SO WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT AND WHAT THE OTHER CANCER CHARITIES THAT WE WORK WITH ARE SO WORRIED
IS THAT VERY SOON WE'RE GOING TO SEE CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE POTENTIALLY INCURABLE CANCER MISSING OUT ON MODERN TREATMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR ACROSS THE BORDER IN THE U.K. ISN'T THERE A PROBLEM INHERENT IN THIS FUND IT IS MASSIVELY INCREASED SPENDING IT'S IN THE PAST SIX YEARS SPENDING WENT UP FROM A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION AND ONE EXTRA TREATMENT FOR ONE CANCER SUFFERER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY ONE CANCELLED TREATMENT
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE OF COURSE ANY SYSTEM ANY NEW SYSTEM HAS TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO A SYSTEM THAT HASN'T CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE CANCER DRUG FUND WAS INTRODUCED AND WHAT WE NEED IS WE NEED THE PRIME MINISTER TO INTERVENE
HELP BRING TOGETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH NICE AND INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH A REALLY FLEXIBLE WORK ON WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN PRACTICE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DON'T WANT THE CURRENT SYSTEM YOU ACCEPT IT SPENDING TOO MUCH YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANNA GO BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM WHAT DO YOU WANT THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE CANCER DRUG FUND THAT HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO AN END WE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION AND WE'RE MOVING BACK TO THE NICE SYSTEM THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT HASN'T CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY THERE'S STILL A PROBLEM AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO IT O.K. LET'S BRING IN DOCTOR RICHARD TALBOT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY FORGIVE ME I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THIS DO YOUR FAULT ISN'T IT IN OTHER WORDS DRUGS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DO DEAL WITH CANCER WE OFTEN IN THE N.H.S. PAID DOUBLE WHAT SOMEONE WILL PAY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR PRECISELY THE SAME DRUG
I TELL YOU CONTEST THE FACT THAT WE PAY DOUBLE BUT CLOCK PRICES CLEARLY PART OF THE EQUATION HERE I THINK THERE IS THERE IS A REAL RECOGNITION ON THE PART OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT THEY NEED TO OFFER VALUE FOR MONEY FOR THE N.H.S. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NICE NICE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF SCRUTINISING THE VALUE FOR MONEY ABOUT PRODUCTS
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN CANCERS PLANETS MORGAN I OUTLINED HERE BUT LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE TITHE FOR BREAST CANCER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE U.K. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THAILAND SPRAY SULPHUR LEUKAEMIA THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE U.K. FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BRAZIL THAT IS MORE THAN DOUBLE I CAN'T VERIFY THOSE NUMBERS BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK IT'S QUITE RIGHT THAT
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES PAY DIFFERENT PRICES AND I I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL THAT POORER COUNTRIES PAY LESS FOR MEDICINES THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE CAN ONLY AFFORD TO CHARGE A VERY LOW PRICES IN VERY POOR COUNTRIES IF THE RICHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD ARE PAYING THEIR SHARE AND WE'RE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD HERE SO IS YOUR ARGUMENT TO GOVERNMENT YOU SIMPLY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MORE IF YOU WANT THE CANCER DRUGS YOU SAY YOU WANT DOCTORS SAY THEY WANT PATIENTS ARE DEMANDING TOUGH BY THE BELL
I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF RECOGNITION FROM COMPANIES THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR THE N.H.S. COMPANIES WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH THE N.H.S. AND NICE AND FIND A WAY OF GETTING ACCESS TO PET TO TO PATIENTS WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE BUT I DO THINK IN COMING TO THE TABLE THE GOVERNMENT ALSO NEEDS TO ASSESS ARE WE INVESTING ENOUGH IN CANCER BUT AS MORGAN HOW DO YOU AVOID SIMPLY LOBBYING THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT MORE MONEY MORE PROFITS INTO HIS MEMBERS POCKET
WE'VE BEEN LOBBYING THE COMPANIES AS WELL WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM IN GETTING THE BEST DRUGS TO PATIENTS WHAT WE NEED IS A FLEXIBLE SYSTEM WHERE THERE CAN BE NEGOTIATION WHERE IT WILL BE FAIR BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING IN CANCER NOW IT COULD HAPPEN IN OTHER CONDITIONS SOON IN THE FUTURE AS WELL SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR A MODERN HEALTH SERVICE TO HAVE ACCESS TO MODERN TREATMENTS DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A DANGER THAT WE
PUT CANCER ON A SORT OF IF YOU LIKE SPENDING PEDESTAL THAT THERE ARE MANY ILLNESSES THAT ARE HORRENDOUS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE CANCER CLEARLY OFTEN IS I SPEAK WITH KNOWLEDGE OF IT BUT IS IT RIGHT REALLY TO SAY CANCER IS DIFFERENT CANCEROUS SPECIAL OR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CANCER RESEARCH AT THE MOMENT IS LEADING TOWARDS MUCH MORE PERSONALISED TREATMENTS THAT DON'T FIT WITH THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE FOR VALUE EVALUATION NOW SO IT HAS TO CHANGE AND IT HAS TO IMPROVE LONG'S QUICK WORD
LAST QUICK WORD IS THAT WE MANAGED TO SOMEHOW DO A DEAL IN MOST COUNTRIES SO THE PATIENTS GET ACCESS TO MEDICINES INCLUDING ON OUR OWN DOORSTEP IN SCOTLAND WHERE THERE IS MORE FLEXIBILITY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT FLECK SPITTING YOU CAME WE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE DOCTOR RICHARD TALBOT BARONESS DOES MORGAN THANK YOU JOHN
IT IS NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND THE WEATHER IS SO HOT HERE THAT MY CLOCK IS PACKING IN
BUT LET'S FIND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE THERE STABBED THE FORECAST TASTER HI THERE SARAH YEAH IT IS HOT THERE IT COULD BE A RISK OF SOME BIG THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL IN THE AREA BUT HERE IT'S COOLER WE'VE GOT HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING THINGS SETTLED BUT THE AREA'S BEEN COOL AND IT'S BEEN CHILLY OVERNIGHT AS ONE IT HAS BEEN A CHILLY START TO TODAY ANOTHER SO IF I PUSH IS GOING TO BE BREAKING DOWN INTO TOMORROW AND THAT'LL ALLOW WET AND WINDY WEATHER TO MOVE IN OFF THE ATLANTIC SO FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK AFTER MONDAY IT'S LOOKING MORE UNSETTLED FOR ALL OF US
BACK TO TODAY THERE FOR ENGLAND AND WALES IT HAS BEEN QUITE A COOL START LOTS OF SUNSHINE AROUND A BIT OF CLOUD ACROSS THE NORTH AND EAST AND IT'S HE'S FAIRLY COOL AS WELL BUT THE SUNSHINE WILL GET GOING ON THOSE TEMPERATURES WILL SEE SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AGAIN IN THE BEST OF THEM ACROSS THE MIDLANDS SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND ALSO ACROSS SOUTH WALES TO BECOME WARM TEMPERATURES FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN MAYBE TWENTY CELSIUS BUT A BIT COOLER IN THE CLOUDIER SPOTS
WE COULD SEE THE ODD THERE BIT OF CLOUD BUBBLING UP ACROSS THE FAR NORTH AND EAST TO LOVE THE ODD STRAY SHOWER OTHERWISE MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY FOR SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND CLOUDY START FOR MUCH OF NORTHERN IRELAND AND FOR NORTHERN SO HALF OF SCOTLAND THE ODD PATCH OF LIGHT RAIN ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTH WEST HIGHLANDS BUT THE CLOUD WILL THIN AND BREAK TO LOVE SOME GOOD SUNNY SPELLS TO BE QUITE WIDELY FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND FOR CENTRAL SOUTHERN SCOTLAND SO FEELING QUITE WARM AGAIN TEMPERATURES FIFTEEN TO MAYBE SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS NORTHERN SCOTLAND NORTHERN ISLES THERE WILL HOLD ONTO THE CLOUD THROUGHOUT THE DAY
SO IT WILL BE RATHER COOL HERE TEMPERATURES OF TEN TO TWELVE DEGREES AND THEN VINCIT TOMORROW IT WOULD BE A FINE DAY FOR MUCH OF ENGLAND AND WALES AND EASTERN SCOTLAND WITH SOME SUNSHINE BUT WETTER WINDIER CONDITIONS ARRIVE ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND WESTERN SCOTLAND THROUGH THE DAY THE SPREADING TO ALL PARTS DURING TUESDAY NIGHT

HERE AMONGST THESE CHURCHES WE SEE A SORT OF
THERE'S A SILENCE HERE THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS CAN'T DO WHAT HUMAN BEING SHOULD DO WHICH IS TO BE HERE TO BE ABLE TO WORSHIP IN SAFETY THAT WAS JAMES CULLEN
THANK YOU KATHY IT IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT TURN THE BOATS BACK PUT UP THE FENCES BUILD A WALL ALL REACTIONS TO THE BIGGEST PEACETIME MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OUR PLANET HAS EVER WITNESSED TO COPE WITH THE WORLD ON THE MOVE THERE ARE NOW SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY DISPLACED WORLDWIDE NINETEEN MILLION OF THOSE ARE CLASSIFIED AS REFUGEES AND HALF OF THOSE ARE CHILDREN
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW WE CAN DISSUADE THEM FROM MAKING THEIR HAZARDOUS JOURNEYS AND ALL FOCUS INSTEAD A WELCOMING AND HOUSING AND EDUCATING THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR JOURNEY DOMINATE POLITICS NOT JUST HERE NOT JUST IN THE REST OF EUROPE BUT IN WEALTHY COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE GLOBE THAT'S THE THEME OF THIS DAY OF SPECIAL B.B.C. PROGRAMMES BEGINNING WITH SARAH IN VIETNAM AND BE HERE IN THE RADIO THEATRE IN BROADCASTING HOUSE IN LONDON
THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE WITNESSED AN EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT IN THIS STORY MIGRANTS HAVE ALMOST STOPPED ARRIVING IN THE GREEK ISLANDS FROM TURKEY THE TOTAL FOR THE PAST MONTH FEWER THAN FOUR MANY PREVIOUS INDIVIDUAL DAYS THEY'RE ALL THERE OF COURSE STILL FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO'VE ALREADY REACHED GREEK SHAW'S MANY OF THEM AT THE END OF MANY CAMP NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER THAT PATIENCE IS RUNNING THIN HE KEITEL AND MAYA NOW REPORTS
THEY CUT BELOW SUDDENLY A LEYLAND REMAIN UNTIL AUGUST THE HEIGHT OF PUBS I REMEMBER EVERY TIME YOU PUT IN MY EIGHT MILLION STEW ROCKS HAS BRED A POEM ABOUT THE WALL IN SYRIA
AWARD THAT'S FORCED TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD EMMA A BLOKE ASKS TO FLEE HIS HOME TO THE HELP OF LAND UP FOR ISLA REMEMBER BEFORE FALLING ASLEEP ON ANY PILLOW TO THIS SLEEP
THOSE WHO SLAUGHTERED THEIR COUNTRY LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHERS EMMA SET OFF ON A PERILOUS JOURNEY TO REACH EUROPE SAFER SHAUN'S NOW HE STUCK AT A SPRAWLING REFUGEE CAMP IN AID OF ANY ON THE BORDER BETWEEN CHRIS A LESSON
HERE THAT'S JUST VERY BUT EVERY PAYING THE BURDEN WITH YOU AND ELAINE I HAVE GREEN WHERE HE'S MADE IT
MOST PEOPLE LET YOU KNOW MANY HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS FROM BEING JUST A POINT OF TRANSIT FOR THE MIGRAINES IT NOW LOOKS LIKE A TIN TO TOWN AND THEY'D LUSH GREEN FIELDS AND MUD
THERE'S A SCHOOL MOSQUES A CHURCH AND EVEN A STREET MARKET THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU THOUGH IS JUST HOW MANY CHILDREN THERE ARE
AMMAN HAS HAST
A ONE MONTH OLD SON THE CHI BUSHES ALONG IN A PRAM AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS WHO BOOK BESIDE HER SSH
MUM THE FIRE IN THIS YEAR
I'M JUST COMING TO A LARGE WHITE DES AND INSIDE I CAN SEE
FIVE SMALL TENS I MEANS EXTENDED FAMILY LIVES HERE THERE'S BLANKETS ON THE FLOOR FOOD ON A SHELF IN THE CORNER AND HER HUSBAND'S JUST WALKED IN WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BIG BOX OF BOTTLED WATER
IT DOES HAVE A VERY HOMELY MUST BE A BIT OF COURSE IT IS A FAR CRY FROM THE HOME THAT THEY'VE LEFT BEHIND IN THE LEPERS
A HOME IN WHICH THEY LOST THEIR OLDEST CHILD IN A BOMBING ANGER AGAINST EUROPE IS GRILLING IN THIS FAMILY AND INDEED IN THE CAMP
MEANS HUSBAND THEY ARE SAYS EUROPE HAS OPENED ITS GATES TO ANIMALS BUT NOT HUMANS WHEN THEIR BUM HERE
GUT SMALL YOU'RE OF THE OPEN SEA THAT
TO GIVE HIM OR GIVE WOMEN WHY HAVE YOU GOT TO BE THOUGHT OF
I'M RIGHT BY THE METAL FENCE WHICH IS THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA
THERE'S A BIG GATE ON THAT GATE THERE'S A BOARD THAT SAYS CHECKPOINT REGISTRATION THIS GATE HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE ARE STILL POLICEMEN WHO ARE KEEPING WATCH BUT ON THIS SIDE THERE'S A GROUP OF CHILDREN PLAYING A GAME
FAMILIES FROM YOU DO MANY HAVE BEGUN TO BE MOVED UP TO EFFICIENT CAMPS BUT THAT'S JUST A TEMPORARY SOLUTION
I ASK YOUR GHOST COMMITTEES A SPOKESMAN FOR THE GREEK GOVERNMENT IF THEY HAVE A LONG TERM PLAN WITH THE WORK GOING TO DO THROW THEM FOR THE SEA
REMEMBER IF THEY DISCOVER BLED THE WORRY LOOK GIG FROM IT IS SIXTY SIX THOUSAND
IT'S A EUROPEAN PROBLEM AND WE HOPE THERE WILL BE A DOCUMENTARY
BUT IT'S A LONG UNCERTAIN PROCESS MOST REFUGEES HAVE ALREADY SPENT MONTHS EVEN YEARS ON THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF SAFETY AND A DECENT LIFE
AND SOME DON'T WANT TO WAIT I'M MORE AS MY MOTHER O.K. YOUKI A STUDENT FROM DARAA TELLS ME HE'LL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN TO GET TO THE U.K.
EVEN IF IT MEANS TAKING AN ILLEGAL ROOT
WITH SOME EGLIN GOODNESS MAKE LURVE TODAY WAS FULLY HIS SKETCHES I WILL AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN
YOU GITA LE MIRE REPORTING THERE WITH ME IN THE RADIO THEATRE BROADCASTING HAS TENURE STEAL THE INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SAVE THE CHILDREN ALONGSIDE HER STILL WITH US FOR THE REST OF THE PROGRAMME THESE TO SET OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT SAY THE CHILDREN ARE CALLING FOR THIS NEW DEAL TENNIS STEEL IT'S A NEW DEAL THAT APPLIES WHETHER YOU'RE IN EUROPE WITH THE OUTSIDE ON THE BORDERS OF THAT WAR IN SYRIA ELSEWHERE AND INDEED ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD
YES THAT'S RIGHT CHILDREN OR INDEED PEOPLE ON THE MOVE IS A DEFINING ISSUE OF OUR TIME AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE CALLING ON AN AMBITIOUS PLAN IT A NEW DEAL FOR REFUGEE CHILDREN AT THIS MORNING THREE AND A HALF MILLION CHILDREN WILL NOT GO TO SCHOOL AND WITHIN THAT THERE'S AN EVEN WORRYING STATISTIC OF ONE IN FOUR CHILDREN OF SECONDARY AGE SCHOOL WILL ATTEND SCHOOL
I'VE GOT A TEN YEAR OLD SON THE PROSPECT OF HIM MISSING A YEAR OR EVEN TWO YEARS OF EDUCATION MEANS THAT HIS FUTURE WILL BE DESTROYED HIS CHANCE OVER SKILLED JOB OR THE CHANCE TO GO TO UNIVERSITY WILL BE GONE IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO FEED TO HOUSED TO CLOTHE REFUGEES IS IT REALLY PRACTICAL TO SAY THAT WITHIN A MONTH ANYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD YOU CAN EDUCATE
I MEAN I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF INFORMAL AS WELL AS FORMAL EDUCATION BUT ULTIMATELY EDUCATION DOES NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS A PRIORITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT FOOD AND SHELTER ARE AS WELL BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT CHILDREN'S FUTURES ULTIMATELY ALSO YOU ARE IN EFFECT ACCEPTING THAT THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY TO EVER GO HOME YOU ARE TRYING NOT TO EDUCATE THEM FOR A NEW LIFE
I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY ON AVERAGE YOU CAN EXPECT TO BE A REFUGEE FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS SO FOR GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD FOR WORLD LEADERS TO NOT PLAN FOR THESE CHILDREN'S FUTURE REALLY IS STARTING TO THROW THOSE FUTURES AWAY THESE FINANCIALLY WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE IF WE ARE TALKING REALISTICALLY OF TRYING TO GET AN EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS PEOPLE INDEED TRAVELLING YOU'RE NOT YET IN CAMBS HOW BIGGER CHALLENGES THAT
IT IS HUGELY AMBITIOUS TO THE POINT OF ALMOST BEING A DREAM BUT IT IS THE DREAM THAT IF IT IS AND FULFIL WILL TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO FOR SO MANY SO MANY PEOPLE IN SO MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD OF CHILDREN I'M NOT EDUCATED IT MEANS THEY WILL GROW UP WITHOUT A FUTURE WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING POSITIVELY TO SOCIETY IDENT TERMS OF THE STABILITY OR FUTURE PROSPERITY OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY LIVE BUT IT'S A MEASURE OF HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS WHEN EVEN GERMANY THE POWERHOUSE OF EUROPE IS STRUGGLING TO EDUCATE
ALL OF THE REFUGEE CHILDREN HAVE WERE FLOODED INTO THEIR COUNTRY EVEN NORWAY IS SAYING TO SOME SERIOUS NEIGHBOURS WE MAY HAVE TO HOLD BACK SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE HAD GENEROUSLY GIVEN TO YOU TO EDUCATE CHILDREN IN THE CAMPS IN JORDAN AND LEBANON BECAUSE WE HAVE TO EDUCATE THEM IN NORWAY THERE MAY BE PEOPLE LISTENING I'M SURE THERE ARE TEN WHO WILL SAY LOOK
WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY WHAT IS NOW HAPPENING IN GREECE I SEE THE FACT THAT THE FLOW OF REFUGEES HAS ACTUALLY ALMOST STOPPED SHOWS THAT IT IS THE TOUGH RESPONSE NOT THE COMPASSIONATE RESPONSE THAT WORKS IT IS SIMPLY SAYING DON'T BOTHER COME COMING YOU WON'T MAKE IT IT WON'T BE A BETTER LIFE THAT IS BETTER FOR YOU AND BETTER FOR US I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE QUESTION MUCH MORE BROADLY BECAUSE WHILST WE'RE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE MANY REFUGEES THAT HAD REACHED EUROPEAN SHORES
ACTUALLY EIGHTY SIX PER CENT OF REFUGEE CHILDREN SIT IN MIDDLE OR LOW INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THOSE EFFECTIVELY ARE ALSO THE CHILDREN THAT WE ARE CALLING FOR A NEW DEAL FOR THEIR FUTURE AND THEIR EDUCATION DO YOU NOT ACCEPT THOUGH THAT WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE USE INCENSE EVIDENCE THAT NOT THAT YOU COULD END GLOBAL FLOWS OF MIGRANTS OF COURSE YOU CAN'T BUT GOVERNMENTS CAN IF THEY CHOOSE DRAMATICALLY CUT THEM
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO ASSUME THAT THIS IS NOW THE END OF A CRISIS CERTAINLY A SAVE THE CHILDREN WE ARE AWARE OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN LIBYA WHO WERE LIKELY TO MAKE VERY PERILOUS JOURNEYS THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY STILL AN ISSUE OF A TIME THESE THAT'S A QUESTION ISN'T IT ALWAYS SQUEEZING ONE BIT OF THE BALLOON ONLY TO SEE IT EMERGE ELSEWHERE IN OTHER WORDS THOSE MIGRANTS HAD AREN'T COMING ACROSS THE WATERS FROM TURKEY TO GREECE WILL THEY COME FROM
DO YOU THINK OF ANYONE HAD A CHOICE THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO COME ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN WHICH USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN IN BOATS IF THERE WAS A PROPER SYSTEM A GLOBAL SYSTEM OF DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS AND YES THE FACT THAT THOUGH THE GREECE TURKEY ROUTE IS NOW CLOSING DOWN THEN I'M GOING FROM LIBYA TO ITALY WHICH IS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THE WORK HAS TO CONFRONT US AND I WOULD SAY THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO REFUGEES COMING NOW TELLS US THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER A LOT SOONER WE ARE
HOPELESSLY DIVIDE IT AND IS ORGANISED ON THIS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME LOSE TWO SENT TANNI'S DEAL OF SAVE THE CHILDREN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT
IT'S WIDELY ACCEPTED HERE IN VIETNAM THAT IF YOU CAN AFFORD AN EDUCATION OVERSEAS THEN IT'S GOOD TO LEAVE TO GET ONE PEOPLE TALK OF THE COUNTRY BENEFITING FROM THE SKILLS THAT YOUNG VIETNAMESE PICK UP OVERSEAS AND THEN BRING
YOU MAY ALSO BE BOWING TO THE INEVITABLE THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO STOP THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE NOR INDEED STOP THEM FROM STAYING AWAY
WELL I'M JOINED HERE IN A LITTLE ROOF TOPS STUDIO AT THE TOP OF THE CARAVEL HOTEL IN HO CHI MIN CITY BYE
KEN FEMME WHO LEFT ON A BOAT IN THE SEVENTIES HE GREW UP IN THE STATES WHERE HE BECAME A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN AND ALL THEIR REGISTER DEMOCRAT WORK FOR PRESIDENT REAGAN AND BOTH BUSHES
AND THEN TEN YEARS AGO CAME BACK TO LIVE AND WORK HERE AND ALSO BY MADAME TOM LUTEA TIN SHE USED TO BE VIETNAM'S AMBASSADOR TO BELGIUM AND HIT WAS HEAD OF MISSION IN BRUSSELS AND WHEN SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HERE SHE WAS VICE CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MADAM
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT VERY RELAXED ABOUT SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE LEAVE
IS THE PRESUMPTION THAT ACTUALLY THERE'S NOT MUCH THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT THEY'LL PROBABLY COME
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO PROBLEM IN HAVING YOUNG PETE
TRIED TO GET A BETTER HIDE YOUR KISHAN ABROAD I DON'T THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING ANYTHING TO BREED THEN
THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW MANY OF THEM COME BACK WITH WHAT KIND OF SKILLS
EDUCATION WOULD BE THE QUESTION IS CAN WE ATTRACT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE TO COME BACK DO YOU
AFTER THEY HAD NOT ONLY COMPLETED THIS EDUCATION BUT ALSO
WORK FOR SOME YEARS TO GAIN THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL WINDS BACK UPS SO I THINK WE WERE ALL RELAX IN THE GARDEN THEN
THE FAMILY IS PART OF A NEW MOBILITY AND FAMINE OR WHERE YOU'RE THE MOST SURPRISING PERSON TO HAVE COME BACK BECAUSE YOU LEFT HERE ON A BOAT AND CAME BACK WHAT WAS IT THAT DREW YOU
I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN I GOT ON A BOAT AND LEFT VIETNAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SECURE A BETTER LIFE AND EDUCATION OUTSIDE VIETNAM AND TEN YEARS AGO HE WAS A DECISION AGAIN DOUBLE AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF I'M SNOUT ONLY TO MY OLD SELF BUT DO THE SOCIETY HERE NOTE TOO
A BUTT HOLE
BUT OF COURSE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COUNTRY THAT WAS AT WAR FOR SO LONG AND WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE FOR SOME THE SCARS ARE STILL VERY DEEP AND ONE SOMETHING SOMEBODY WAS SAYING TO US EARLIER AS ALMOST AN UNSPOKEN RULE THAT YOU SORT OF HAVE TO
MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND AGREED TO KEEP SILENT DID YOU FIND THAT ALL YES AND I NEED PEACE I THINK
THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE AND WITH THE PASTA SIDE AND FORWARD
FORWARD TO THE DIFFERENCE THAT ONE CAN MAKE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR RETURN EACH BUT IS IT IS IS PART OF THAT
DEAL ALSO AN AGREEMENT TO KEEP SIGHT
NO I DON'T KEEP SILENT I MAKE U.S. ISN'T HERE I SPEAK MY MIND WHEN THEY SEE THINKS THERE SHOULD BE
CORRECT
AND I THINK I'VE FOUND PLENTY OF RECEPTOR YEARS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY THIS COUNTRY'S NOT NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
NO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT'S PHENOMENAL IT'S IN SO MANY WAYS IT'S SUCH A FASCINATING MIX BECAUSE IT'S A VERY MODERN COUNTRY IN MANY WAYS
BUT THERE IS CLEAN WE KNOW WE'VE NOTICED IT HERE YESTERDAY THE POLICE
CLOSED A SQUARE REPORTEDLY TO STOP A PROTEST ABOUT FISH THAT PEOPLE THINK HAVE BEEN POLLUTED BY A STEEL
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S NERVOUS OF DISSENT MADAM
CAN YOU SEE THAT AS PEOPLE PERHAPS BECOME INCREASINGLY INDEPENDENT THEIR JOBS ARE NO LONGER DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY'RE PERHAPS WE'LL BE MORE INDEPENDENT OF MUM
WELL INDEPENDENCE OF MIND IS SOMETHING THAT EDUCATION'S SHOULD BREED IN OUR CITIES
FAMILIES I THINK GILL WELCOME THAT AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEARN TO LIFT WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT IT MAKES
SOUND SOCIETY MORE ROBUST SOCIETY IF CITIZENS THINK INDEPENDENCE
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT ITS GRANDEST DAD THERE ARE HEALTHY PROTESTS THAT A POSSIBLE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AFTER
BUT IT'S WHETHER IT'S PERHAPS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE LAW DO YOU PERHAPS PREDICT A FEW BUMPY YEARS AHEAD BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REALLY IS CLEARLY NERVOUS
ANY FORM APPROACH
WELL BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER TIME
I THINK IT IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS LEARNED TO TO LIVE WITH IT
A BIT MORE IT WILL HAVE TO
TO LIVE WITH IT EVEN BETTER HOPE A NEVER MORE FLEXIBLE AND AGILE MAN IT'S BAD LOVER I THINK OF GLOBALISATION AND OFF MODERN
AND THAT POINT AT WHICH WE STARTED THE FINE FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE MAKE IT WORTH THEIR WHILE COMING
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK WILL ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE
I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN
THEY'RE FAST GROWING ECONOMY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOCIETY BRINGING OUT IF YOUNG FAMILY
I HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL FRIENDS
BECAUSE HERE THEY CARE
GET MARY DICK AND RAISING CHILDREN IN THE VIETNAMESE CULTURE WHILE THEY STILL KEEP GOOD TIES WITH THE U.S.
OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY RETURN FROWNED AND THAT'S CLEAR IT'S BEEN SO CLEAR THEIR TIES FROM FAMILY SO OFTEN NO WHAT BRING PEOPLE
MADAME LYNNE AND KIM THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT GARY IS HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS GARY HE'S ONLY JUST A TAD SCEPTICAL A MIGHTY MATCH YOU'RE NOT A GOOD SCORE NINETEEN GOALS AGAINST BOURNEMOUTH TOMORROW NIGHT OR DIE CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY WELL I THINK EVEN BY UNITED'S EXCELLENT STANDARDS THIS SEASON THEY MIGHT STRUGGLE EGG GOOD MORNING TO YOU THAT'S THE START CRACK AT THAT IF UNITED WANT TO QUALIFY FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THEY'VE GOT A SCORE NINETEEN AGAINST BOURNEMOUTH THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED YESTERDAY MANCHESTER CITY DREW AT SWANSEA SO AS THINGS STAND THERE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
LET'S BE HONEST THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO FINISH S'POSE FIVE ONE DEFEAT AT NEWCASTLE MEANS THEY FINISHED THIRD AND ARSENAL SECOND AT FOLLOWING THE FOUR NIL WIN OVER ASTON VILLA BUT THE CHAMPIONS LEINSTER THE CHAMPIONS LEINSTER THEY DREW IT CHELSEA FORMER CHELSEA AND ENGLAND INTERNATIONAL GRAEME SO HE'S HERE GRAEME GOOD MORNING TO YOU LESTER WINNING THE LEAGUE FOOTBALL'S MOST SURPRISING STORY YOU PLAYED FOR BLACKBURN THE LAST SHOCK WINNERS WHAT LESSONS CAN LESTER LEARN BEARING IN MIND
BLACKBURN SADLY HAVE SORT OF ALMOST DISAPPEARED WITHOUT TRACE I WOULD BE TERRIBLY SAD IF THAT HAPPENED TO LEICESTER I THINK ONE OF THE MISTAKES WE AS A CLUB MADE AT BLACKBURN WAS THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE WE FINISHED FOURTH SECOND AND THEN WON IT IN THREE SUCCESSIVE SEASONS AND THEN THE CLUB HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD FROM THAT SOME TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO BE A BIT MORE RUTHLESS THAN THEY WERE WITH THE SQUAD FRESHEN IT UP AND KEEP THE COMPETITION AND ACTUALLY YOU GET TO THE END OF A LONG SEASON IT'S A HUGE RELIEF
BUT IT'S A RE SET FOR THE START OF THE NEXT SEASON AND WE FAILED TO DO THAT AT THAT WHEN SUCH A VERY IMPORTANT TIME NOW FOR THE LEICESTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LIVE RIDGE THAT SPIRIT THAT SUCCESS AND THAT MOMENTUM AND FOR OTHER CLUBS AS WELL I MEAN DO YOU GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE LIKES OF SOUTHAMPTON WEST BROM STOKE CRYSTAL PALACE THAT THEY HAVE A GENUINE CHANCE BEARING IN MIND WHAT LEICESTER HAVE DONE WELL IN YOUR INTRO YOU SAY THE SHOCK OF LEICESTER WINNING AND IT JUST GOES TO PROVE THAT IF YOU GET EVERYTHING RIGHT
YOU CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO UPSET THE STATISTICS AND THE ODDS AND THAT'S THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT SPORT BUT IF I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT LEICESTER THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS THAT WERE ALIGNED IN'T INCLUDING POOR FORM OF THE OF THE OF USUAL SUSPECTS IN TERMS OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE SO IT OF COURSE IT'S IT'LL BE UNUSUAL BE TOUGH OR ANY OF THOSE CLUBS YOU'VE MENTIONED TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT THERE'S HOPE THAT IF YOU GET IT RIGHT YOU GET THE TEAM SPIRIT RIGHT
BELIEF WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE ENGLAND MANAGER ROY HODGSON NAME AS HIS TEAM OF SQUAD RATHER FOR THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING THE DEFENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS VULNERABLE AS A FORMER ENGLAND DEFENDER DEFENDER WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WORD VULNERABLE ARE THEY
WELL THEY THEY THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MINUTES TOGETHER HAVE THEY SO ANY ANY SORT OF GROUP OF PLAYERS A UNIT WITHIN A TEAM NEEDS TO BUILD UP A RELATIONSHIP BUILD UP THAT TRUST AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WHETHER IT'S POOR FORM WITH ITS INJURIES TO TO PLAYERS THAT YOU WOULD THINK LIKE LUKE SURE HE WAS DOING VERY WELL SO HE'S GOT A CHANCE NOW BETWEEN NOW AND THE START OF THE TOURNAMENT TO REALLY GET THOSE PLAYERS UNDERSTANDING AND THINKING
ABOUT EACH OTHER AND KNOWING WHAT EACH OTHER'S GOING TO DO INTUITIVELY WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENTS THERE'S ALWAYS SO MUCH HOPE BUT THEN WHEN ENGLAND GET THEIR SADLY THEY USUALLY FALL OR WHAT WAY CAN YOU ACTUALLY BE OPTIMISTIC AT ALL ABOUT THIS ONE LISTEN MY GLASS IS ALWAYS HALF FULL SO YOU GO INTO ANY TOURNAMENT BE AN OPTIMISTIC THERE'S A WONDERFUL GROUP OF YOUNG PLAYERS OF ENGLAND THERE'S A LOT OF TALENT THIS GOOD COMPETITION FOR PLACES SO THE INGREDIENTS ARE THERE FOR ENGLAND TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT WE'VE GOTTA BE REALISTIC WHAT IS WHAT IS SUCCESS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AND I THINK THE TEAM PERFORMING AT ITS BEST
MAKES EVERYBODY FEEL BETTER AND A QUICK LAST ANSWER ABOUT THE MANAGER ROY HODGSON IN TERMS OF SUCCESSION PLANNING HER LET'S HOPE ENGLAND DO EXTREMELY WELL AND HE KEEPS HIS JOB BUT SAM ALLARDYCE SAID TO ME YESTERDAY IN AN INTERVIEW ENGLISH MANAGERS ARE A DYING BREED AND I WONDER WHERE IT WHERE IS THE SUCCESSION PLANNING
AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WELL I THINK IT'S WHO'S AVAILABLE AT THE TIME SO WHEN WHEN ROY DECIDES TO TO TO TO GIVE IN TO TO TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STRESS AND HIS INCUMBENT IS AVAILABLE WHO IS THAT PERSON AND I THINK YOU SPOKE TO RICHARD BEVAN EARLIER IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO DEVELOP MANAGERS AND WE GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE EXPERIENCE FOR THEN THE ENGLISH F.A. IN THIS CASE TO SAY RIGHT YOU'RE THE PERSON FOR THE JOB AT THE MOMENT THERE SEEMS TO BE A GAP BETWEEN
ENGLISH CLUB MANAGERS AND THEIR EXPERIENCE WHICH THEN GIVES THEM THE OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITY MANAGE THE NATIONAL GRAHAM THERE SO THANKS FOR CALLING HIM TO SEE US THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT ENGLAND SQUAD BY THE WAY WILL BE ANNOUNCED ON FIVE LIVE AT ELEVEN WITH OUR FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY TO OTHER HEADLINES QUICKLY ANDY MURRAY WON THE ITALIAN OPEN DEFEATING NOVAK DJOKOVIC IN STRAIGHT SETS AND WELL DONE TO MAX FOR STAPP UM AT JUST EIGHTEEN HE'S BECOME THE YOUNGEST EVER WINNER OF A FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX YOU WANT THE RACING SELECTIONS

GREATER MANCHESTER POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONER TONY LLOYD HAS CALLED FOR A FULL INQUIRY INTO HIGHER FAKE BOMB USED FOR TRAINING LEAD TO OLD TRAFFORD BEING EVACUATED BEFORE A PREMIER LEAGUE GAME A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY IS BELIEVED TO HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND BY MISTAKE AFTER AN EXERCISE WITH SNIFFER DOGS
DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID IF HE BECOMES THE NEXT U.S. PRESIDENT HE DOESN'T EXPECT TO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH DAVID CAMERON IN DECEMBER MY CAMERON CALLED MISTER TRUMP DIVISIVE STUPID AND WRONG FOR SAYING HE PUT A TEMPORARY BAN ON MUSLIMS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES NATALIE BENNETT IS TO STEP DOWN AS THE LEADER OF THE GREEN PARTY IN AUGUST THE AUSTRALIAN FORMER JOURNALIST SAYS DURING HER FOUR YEARS IN CHARGE SHE GOT SOMETHING'S WRONG BECAUSE SHE ISN'T WHAT SHE CALLS A SMOOTH SPIN TRAINED POLITICIAN
TWENTY SIX MINUTES TONIGHT THANK YOU CATHY ALMOST WHEREVER YOU ARE ON THE PLANET YOU CAN NOW GET A GLIMPSE OF THE WORLD BEYOND ON YOUR MOBILE ON THE INTERNET VIA A FRIEND OR A RELATIVE OR EVEN A RECRUITER FOR A RADICAL CAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS SO MANY CHOOSE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES TO MAKE LIVES ELSEWHERE ANOTHER IS OF COURSE THE NATURE OF THE REGIME'S THEY'RE OFTEN FLEEING FROM COULD TECHNOLOGY BE USED TO UNDERMINE THOSE OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS AND THEREFORE MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE WORLD
WE'LL BE ON THE MOVE AT LEAST IN SUCH LARGE NUMBERS AND JOIN NOW HERE AT BROADCASTING HOUSE BY HAS BEEN GREEN IS HEAD OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT A JIGSAW I THINK TANK RUN BY ALPHABET WHICH IS THE PARENT COMPANY OVERCOME YOU HAVE HEARD OF GOOGLE AND SHE TRIES TO COME UP WITH TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO GEO POLITICAL PROBLEMS MORNING TO YASMINA A GOOD MORNING
IS THAT YOUR HOPE THAT YOU CAN USE TECHNOLOGY IN THAT WAY TO UNDERMINE THE CAUSES OF PEOPLE FLEEING THEIR OWN COUNTRIES YES THAT'S RIGHT WE CAN LOOK AT HOW TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP PEOPLE IN CONFLICT AND REPRESSION SO TO GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE I RECENTLY CAME BACK FROM IRAQ
WHERE'S INTERVIEWING PEOPLE WHO HAD RECENTLY LEFT THE ISLAMIC STATE SAID THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEOLOGY HAD TRAINED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS AND LEFT THEIR HOMES IN THE WESTERN AROUND THE WILD AND THEY'VE GONE INTO A SYRIA AND IRAQ TO FIGHT FOR ISIS THEY REALISED THAT IT WASN'T LIKE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT IT WAS A MYTH AND THEY LEFT
WHAT WELL WHAT BETTER WAY TO FIGURE OUT THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN HELPING FOR SOMETHING LIKE TERRORISM AND TO GO AND ASK EXACTLY THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE EX TESTS I HEARD THAT ON ARRIVAL TO THE CALIPHATE THE ISLAMIC STATE CONFISCATES TWO ITEMS YOUR PASSPORT AND YOUR MOBILE PHONE THE THE SYMBOLS OF YOUR PHYSICAL AND YOUR DIGITAL LIBERTY THEY PUT YOU THROUGH MANDATORY RELIGIOUS TRAINING AND MILITARY TRAINING AFTER WHICH YOU GET BACK YOUR MOBILE PHONE
WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO REACH THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYTHING I HAD MADE ME THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE AND IMMEDIATELY KNOW THAT THEY'VE MADE AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE NOW THERE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD ARGUE WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING TO DEAL WITH FIGHTERS JOINING YES BUT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU'RE SAYING THEY MIGHT ARGUE WITH YOU IN A PIECE FOR THE B. B. C. WEBSITE AND ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ORIGINALLY FROM IRAN AND IT RAN HOMOSEXUALITY IS REGARDED NOT JUST AS A SIN BUT A MYTH PEOPLE MIGHT SAY
JUST WHERE DO YOU STOP TRYING TO KEEP YOUR OWN PEOPLE SAFE AND END UP WITH A FORM OF CULTURAL IMPERIALISM IN WHICH HUGE AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO THINK YEAH I THINK WE SEE EXAMPLES AND JUST JUST EXPAND ON THAT A TINY BIT IN IRAN IT'S NOT JUST CONSIDER DESCENDANTS RUN AT AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC IT'S ONE UNDER ISLAMIC LAW IT'S A CRIME TO BE SEXUAL IT'S ALSO
NOT EVEN A CONCEPT ACCORDING TO THE KIND OF CONSERVATIVE CLERICS SO THEY BASICALLY CONFLATE TRAN SEXUALITY WITH HOMOSEXUALITY FOR PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS THIS IS GOING TO SOUND REALLY JUST UNFATHOMABLE BUT YOU TAKE THE JOB IS IT THE JOB OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO TELL OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER CULTURES WHAT TO THINK
ABSOLUTELY NOT I THINK SOMETIMES WE WE SHY AWAY FROM HELPING PEOPLE IN REPRESSED ENVIRONMENT COS WE THINK THIS IS A CULTURAL AH YOU KNOW THIS IS THERE A SPECIFIC NATIONAL
IDIOSYNCRASY AND WE SHOULD AND WE SHOULDN'T ENCROACH ON OTHER SOVEREIGNTY IN FACT EVERYONE IN THE RATE IN THE WORLD DESERVES THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND IT HELPS KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND IT MAKES THEM
ABLE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AND I THINK THAT APPLIES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SECTION IN IRAN THAT PLACE EVERYONE IN THE WORLD WHAT DO YOU DO THAT WHERE REPRESSIVE REGIME SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PUTTING UP DIGITAL BORDERS AND DIGITAL BEARERS THAN THEY ARE PHYSICAL BOARDS AND BURIED THEM IN ONE THINKS OF CHINA FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE SAW YESTERDAY ONLY LAST WEEK A B.B.C. BROADCAST BLACKED OUT WHEN HE'D SAID SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT SEEMS THAT IF THEY SPEND ENOUGH MONEY THESE GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING PEOPLE ACCESSING WHAT THEY WANT TO READ
ALL RIGHT THEY'RE VERY VERY WELL RESOURCED A LOT OF THESE AND CYBER POLICE DEPARTMENTS JUST GIVE GIVING EXAMPLES OF SOMETHING THAT GOES TO TO TO THE VISION OF AN INTERNET WITHOUT BORDERS THERE'S AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED CHORD E. PROXY WHICH IS A WAY TO BASICALLY BUILD A TUNNEL THROUGH INVISIBLE BORDERS AND GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO FREE AND OPEN INTERNET THESE TORS ARE OUT THERE THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPED AT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET IS NOT AN INEVITABILITY BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'LL GET THERE
YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE YES AND WHAT WILL YOU NOW DO IN ORDER TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT IN FACT COMPANIES LIKE YOUR OWN AND NOT VERY BOLD WHEN IT DOESN'T COST YOU MONEY BUT A VERY VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN IT DOES AND THEREFORE TEND TO KENNEL TOWSER REGIMES WHERE YOU WANT SOME SORT OF CO OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENT
MY GROUP TAKES ALSO WHERE PART OF ALPHABET WE'RE NOT QUITE WE'RE NOT ANY BIG TEC COMPANY OURSELVES I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT I CAN SEE THAT IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN THE INTERESTS OF GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND YOU TUBE TO BE AVAILABLE IN

THERE PARTS OF THE WORLD MY FACEBOOK'S NOT EVEN AVAILABLE IN IRAN YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS FACE BUT GOT YOU CHEAP OR OR TWITTER JUST PARTS OF INTERNET BIG CHUNKS THAT ARE MISSING AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE TECH COMPANIES AND WHAT YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS COMPANIES I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL BIG HI TECH COMPANIES YOU'VE GOT TO GAIN TRUST THOUGH AND ON A NUMBER OF AREAS THERE IS NO TRUST EVEN THE UNITED STATES NOW AN ARGUMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONSERVATIVE SMALL C. CONSERVATIVE OPINIONS ARE BEING CENSORED BY FACEBOOK BECAUSE THEY'D SUIT THE VALUES
OF THE PEOPLE SEE A MOSQUE VALUES NEW TROUBLES ORGANISATION SORRY I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WE ARE I THINK BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE FOR TEN YEARS I CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I THINK THE COMPANY HAS VALUES I THINK THEY BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY I THINK FREE EXPRESSION IS A CORE VALUE I WOULD SAY
WE HAVE A POSITIVE I PROBABLY SUBSCRIBE TO THAT THERE'S A DEBATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THAT WAS YASMIN GREED FROM JIGSAW WHICH IS PART OF ALPHABET WOULD YOU KNOW AS GOOGLE IT IS NOW COMING UP TO NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK

THE PROBLEM IS A VERY BIG ONE AND HE WAS GOING TO GO ON IN CRAZY YOU KNOW FEW OFFERS REALISED THAT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION OF EUROPE IN THE LARGE PORTAL NINETEENTH CENTURY MIGRATED TO NORTH AMERICA
YOU KNOW AND I DO NOT AMERICA WAS EMPTY SO THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS NO WELL RATHER EMPTY CAME TO HIS NUT HE HOWDAH TEEN GLOBALLY THERE LURKING IN THE EMPTY CONCLUDES HER GOOD LUCK TO YOU
SORT OF THINGS WE ARE CROSS TO CATCH P.N.C. NOT WHERE THE ROPE NO ROAD THAT IS VERY LOW DENSITY THE POPULATION AND IS A MUSLIM COUNTRY
IT'S PRACTICAL IN THAT SENSE BUT IS IT PRACTICAL IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO GO WE'VE SEEN THAT WHEN THE E.U. HAS TRIED SCHEMES TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM ONE PART OF THE ENTRY PORT USUALLY TO ANOTHER PART TO A LITHUANIAN SWEETEN REMARKABLE UNWILLINGNESS TO MOVE THE SENSE THAT NO NO WE WANT TO GO TO GERMANY BECAUSE THEY'RE OPENING THE DOOR TO WHAT TO GO TO BRITAIN WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS SOMETHING WE KNOW WE'VE GOT RELATIVES OR FRIENDS HOW ON EARTH WOULD YOU EVER PERSUADE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY
I THINK ONE HAS TO THROW STICKS AND CARROTS BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GLOBAL PLANT FOR THIS GET THE ONION
THAT YOU SHOULD BE WILLING TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS THE VIEW THEM INTENT IS TO GO THERE AND GET THE CO OPERATION OF THOSE GARDEN OF COURSE EVERYONE WANTS TO COME HERE OR GO TO GERMANY BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ANY GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADMIT
THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE NO NOT NUMBER ONE HULL LIBERAL I ACTUALLY KNEW THAT IMMIGRATION IS A GOOD THING AND UNLIMITED IMMIGRATION IS A BITTER THING BUT I THINK I'M IN A VERY VERY TINY MONARDA GEAR ONE IN THIS COUNTRY SO I THINK WE WILL
WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION IN WHICH THEY CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING THEY WANT THEY ARE IN DISTRESS SO THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO WHAT WE BUILD THEM SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A GLOBAL SOLUTION YOU'RE TALKING FOR EXAMPLE OF DOING IT AT THE UNITED NATIONS YOU HAVING SOMETHING ON THE SCALE OF A MARSHALL PLAN ABSOLUTE OTHER WORDS IS THE MOTOR OF RUN FOR PEOPLE
WITH HUGE RESOURCE WE HAVE AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA MIGHT WELCOME THAT
I'M SURE TONY BLAIR CAN MANAGE IT
IT'S GONE THEY'RE VERY WELL INDEED VERY WELL INDEED HERE AT THE AT THE RADIO THEATRE IT'S A FASCINATING IDEA LET ME BRING IN LEEDS TO SET OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPOND TO WHO'S SITTING WITH ME HERE IN THE RADIO THEATRE AS WELL PRACTICAL DO YOU THINK THESE DOES IT M. M.
I KNOW THAT NIGEL MAYBE BUT THAT IS A CODE WE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE WAS SO ANYONE HERE FROM CEDRIC BUT I THINK WHAT IS IT REALLY BORED NOW IT HE'S A JOURNALIST ONCE USED THE MORE YOU RAISE THE QUESTIONS THE MORE WE CAN FIND THE ANSWERS TO THESE PROBLEMS
DO WE HAVE TO SEE IT AS A ZERO SUM GAME THAT THE MOVEMENT THE UNPRECEDENTED MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE DOES IT HAVE TO MEAN A REDUCTION IF NOT A SHATTERING OF THE LIVES THAT WE ALL HALL DEAR THIS QUALITY OF LIFE THAT WE HAVE IN BRITAIN AND IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD I COME FROM CANADA AND FROM EASTERN CANADA WHEN I GO HOME THIS TALK OF SCHOOLS CLOSING BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CHILDREN TO BE ENROLLED IN PRIMARY SCHOOL I HEAR BUT NOT ENOUGH TEACHERS
THERE ARE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I DECIDE WE HAVE TO FIND OUR PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THEY DO NEED MIGRANT SICK AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT ANGELA MERKEL SAID AT THE START OF THIS CRISIS THAT GERMANY AS A COUNTRY AS AN AGEING POPULATION NEEDS MORE PEOPLE TO WORK AND IF PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE JOURNEYS ARE WILLING TO COME IN THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY THEY'RE NOT COMING AS SCROUNGERS ALTHOUGH MANY
OF COURSE ACCUSE THEM THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO BE BIG IN LORD AS I'VE BEEN FOR A FINAL WORD ON THAT IS YOUR INSTINCT FOR THIS SOLUTION BECAUSE YOU THINK IT'S WRONG FOR PEOPLE TO COME TO THE PROSPEROUS COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE INCLUDING THE U.K. OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY THINK THE POLITICS OF THESE COUNTRIES THE POLITICS OF YOUR OWN LABOUR PARTY SIMPLY WILL NOT STAND IT I THINK
THE LADDER RATHER THAN THE FORMER I I HAVE SEEN VERY GOOD LIBERAL FRIENDS OF LYING HERE SUDDENLY ARGUE THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED TOO MUCH DIVERSITY AND WE SHOULD NOT HOPE PEOPLE AT IT IS AS WELL DO YOU WANT A GLASS HE COULD RACISM THESE THE WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY YOU KNOW WHITE MORALIST OLIVE COLOURED IT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE IT IS BUSY
THAT IDEA THAT IF THEY COME OUR STANDARD OF LIVING WOULD BE CUT LORD AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LEE USED TO SET HERE IN THE READY THEATRE THANK YOU TOO
IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT
TWO BRITISH AND ONE MEXICAN CLIMBER THE FIRST FOREIGNERS TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST IN TWO YEARS LAST YEAR AT LEAST EIGHTEEN CLIMBERS WERE KILLED IN AN AVALANCHE NEAR BEFORE ANOTHER SIXTEEN WERE KILLED
ONE OF THOSE HE MADE AT THE SUMMIT LAST THURSDAY WAS KENTON CORNER WE LANDED BACK AT HEATHROW JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO
SO I SPOKE TO HIM AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMB
THE TWELFTH OF MAY LAST THURSDAY MORNING MYSELF AND MOB LUCAS WE HAD A ABSOLUTELY AMAZING DAY THERE WITH THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE PERFECT THERE IS NO WIND
AND WE WERE BLESSED BY JUST THE TWO OF US AND OUR TWO TRUSTY SHERPA FRIENDS DORJI CALLA GENE THEN PEMBA BALTAR WE ARE ON THE SUMMIT
RIGHT GLOVES OFF RELATIVELY MILD CONDITIONS
SUCKING IN THEIR VIEW WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY SUBLIME IT WAS AN AMAZING MORE
I KNOW IT'S THE TWELFTH TIME THAT YOU'VE GONE TO THE TOP OF EVER
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE I MEAN WHEN YOU DO IT THE TWELFTH TIME
I THINK EVERY EVERY TIME YOU GO TO THE MOUNTAIN THE MING BUT WITH THE WAY THAT I GO TO THE MOUNTAIN ON A PROFESSIONAL MOUNTAIN GUIDE SO EVERY TIME I GO TO THE MOUNTAIN YOU APPROACH IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE OF THE CLIENT
THIS TIME I WAS BLESSED WITH A FANTASTIC MANGLE ROB LUCA'S SUPER FIT SUPER MOTIVATED SO WE WERE VERY AGILE TEAM THIS YEAR WE COULD
TO TAKE OPPORTUNITIES AS AND WHEN THEY ROSE THAT BUT EVERY TIME I GO TO THE MOUNTAIN YOU'VE GOT TO
APPROACH IN A SANE MAN AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY RESPECTFUL YOU HAVE BE FULLY PREPARED AND IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO BE SO I LOVED IT WAS EVEREST
OF COURSE IT FOLLOWS TWO VERY DIFFICULT YEARS WHEN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE DIED ON THAT MOUNTAIN AS A RESULT OF AVALANCHES GOING UP WAS THE CLIMB THEREFORE MORE DIFFICULT THAN PREVIOUSLY
I DON'T THINK IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT PEOPLE VERY CAUTIOUSLY
THERE WAS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PEOPLE DIED LAST YEAR IN ABOUT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN A YEAR BEFORE HIM ICE FOR COLLAPSES AND OF COURSE THE DEVASTATING AVALANCHE WHICH WAS A RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE THAT HIT THE POOR LAST APRIL BUT IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THE ROUTE ANY HARDER
BUT PEOPLE PEOPLE WERE CAUTIOUS PEOPLE WERE VERY ADAMANT THAT THIS YEAR HAD TO BE A GOOD YEAR ON EVEREST
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHEN I HAVE ANY FIGHTS LIKE WE SAW IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
AND WHAT THE POOL IS GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW IS IF WE REBUILDING PHASE IN EVERY SIR COURSE REPRESENTS A VERY PINNACLE OF THE TOURIST INDUSTRY AND THE TOURIST INDUSTRY BRINGS IN A LOT OF MONEY TO THE COUNTRIES SO PEOPLE WERE VERY VERY CONSCIOUS OF HAVING A GOOD SEASON ON EVEREST AND TOUCH WOOD THUS FAR WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON
IT'S EASING SEEM TO BE GOING RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY THERE'S BEEN NO HICCUPS AND PEOPLE ARE TRICKLING TO THE SUMMIT AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW
AND FOR YOU THAT'S THE TWELVE TIME AS WE SAY I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ONE STAGE AND THINK YOU WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WALK PROPERLY AGAIN COS YOU SHATTERED BOTH YOUR HEELS ARE YOU GOING TO STOP SOON
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT I WAS STOP CLIMBING EVEREST WHEN I FALL OUT OF LOVE WITH
MY MY WIFE JAZZ SAYS THAT EVEREST IS MY MISTRESS
AND I GO BACK EACH YEAR I DO ADORE THE PLACE I LIKE WORKING WITH MY SHERPA FRIENDS I ADORE THE MOUNTAINS HE'S A BEAUTIFUL MAN
AND I WOULD KEEP CLIMBING ON THE MOUNTAIN AND UNTIL I FALL OUT OF LOVE
WHEN I FALL OUT OF LOVE I'D PERHAPS WON'T BE GIVING THE SERVICE TO MY CLIENTS THAT THEY DESERVE SO I DEFINITELY HOPE TO BE BACK
KENTON COOL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT HOW FAST GROWING THIS COUNTRY IS AND HOW THAT'S PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY FOR THOSE FROM HERE BUT THOSE WHO MIGHT WANT TO COME BACK HERE OR MOVE HERE
LAST NIGHT I WENT TO MEET A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOPING TO SHAPE THEIR OWN FUTURE IN THIS COUNTRY
I'VE COME DOWN TO DISTRICT SEVEN WHICH IS ONE OF THE NEWEST PARTS OF THIS CITY
TO A PLACE CALLED SILICON STRAIGHTS BECAUSE IT'S HERE THERE HAS BEEN A COMPETITION WHERE THERE'S BEEN ABOUT FIFTY PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWO DAYS MORE THAN FIFTY HOURS
RUSHING OUT IDEAS BRAINSTORMING SOMETHING THEY HOPE MIGHT ATTRACT THE JUDGES
NOW THEY HAVE TO PITCH WHAT THEY'VE COME UP

JUDGING WHO'S COME UP WITH THE BEST IDEA HERE IS THE SILICON VALLEY MILLIONAIRE
WITH HIM IS EDDIE TIED THEY'RE BOTH KEEN TO PUT MONEY BEHIND GOOD KROGER
WHAT IS IT THE YOU BACK MAKING MONEY
DO YOU KNOW HIS BOYS TO ALLOW ENTREPRENEURS ITSELF REALLY BIG PROBLEMS WITH TECHNOLOGY
AND THE COST OF CREATING A PRODUCT JUST CHEWING IT HAS GONE DOWN OR HAVE MANAGED TO DO THAT ASK FIVE TEN YEARS SO ANYONE THERE'S ENOUGH DRIVE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD REALLY DOUBLE COMPANY GENERATING REVENUE WHAT ABOUT YOU FOR YOU EDDIE TIE WHAT IS IT THAT BRINGS YOU HERE
SAME THING THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF INDUSTRIES TO BE DISRUPTED IN THERE A WHOLE NEW ENTRIES TO BE CREATED THIS PARTLY THE MARKET HERE AS WELL AS THE IDEAS THAT ARE HERE
PRECISELY I MEAN HAS BEEN IN THE STAGE WHERE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE SOME OF THEIR EASIER PROBLEMS AND NOW WHAT THEY HAVE GOOD CONNECTIVITY THE INTERNET IS CHEAP
AND FAST EDDIE TIE I KNOW YOU WERE BORN IN THE STATE BEEN TRYING YOU WERE BORN HERE BUT WERE AIRLIFTED OUT WHEN YOU WERE JUST ONE YEARS OLD AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE DECISION TO COME
WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK OF IT A LOT OF WARNING A LOT OF LECTURING HAPPENED THEY TRIED TO DISSIPATE HIS INVITE ME OVER FOR DINNER AND LECTURED ME FOR A COUPLE HOURS BUT THAT CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
DOING THIS BECAUSE MOST OF THE LARGE PAIRS HERE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SCARS THEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE WAR IT LOOKING AT GREAT NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND OF THINKING BIG
HERE YOU ARE VIETNAMESE FROM OVERSEAS COMING BACK HERE WHAT'S BEEN THE RECEPTION LIKE FROM THOSE WHO HAVEN'T LEFT THE COUNTRY
I THINK THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE COMING FROM THE STATES FROM TECH NOW IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE INFLUX MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO IN THE U.S. IS BECOMING VERY CROWDED TO BE ORDER GO ON CRETE ROO ARCHER COMPANY HERE IT'S GREENFIELD THESE FOUNDERS ARE
POTENTIALLY COMING BACK EVERY YEAR ARE READY TO VISIT FAMILY THEY CAN SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE THERE'S NO RESENT
I CAN'T TELL I'M SURE THERE WAS SCEPTICISM IN TERMS OF FOLKS SAID COME BACK WITH THE WRONG MOTIVES TRUSSES ARIAN ISSUE
IN VIETNAM AND SO THAT ONLY HER AND HER MINDSET BUT I THINK IF YOU ARE COMING WITH THE RIGHT INTENTIONS AND YOU'RE COMING WITH HUMILITY AND PEOPLE LOVED HER PRINT BOOKS ARE
EDDIE TIES SPEAKING TO ME THEY'RE THE START UP SAIGON COMPETITION HERE IN DISTRICT SEVEN THE COACHMAN CITY I'M JOINED IN A LITTLE MIXED SHIFTS STUDIO BY ANDREW ROWE AND AN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR DIRECTOR OF G.K. A.T.A. GROUP AND HE WORKS
IN YOU COME DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES HERE BUT ALSO START UP COMMUNITIES AND LESS ANNOYING AND WHO IS
CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF LONG VAN GROUP IT'S A FAMILY OWNED COMPANY IS BASED HERE AND IN THE STATES AND SHE'S RUNNING THE VIETNAMESE OPERATIONS FOR MORNING
AND AROUND THE REEF HEARING ABOUT EXCITEMENT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY HERE HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S CHANGING
I THINK THE FIRST TIME HE CAME HE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND I STARTED SPENDING A LOT MORE TIME IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS SINCE THEN WE'VE REALLY SEEN MORE ORGANISATION
WITH THAT VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN CITY AND HELP HIM AND I WOULD
SO THERE IS LESS FRAGMENTATION AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS LIKE THE LOCAL ARGENTINA AS I'VE REALLY TAKEN A LIKING TO WORKING SPECIES WHICH WASN'T THE CASE THREE YEARS
AND THROUGH THERE IS A SORT OF THERE WAS A HEAD OF STEAM
YES SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE WINE INTEREST FROM BOTH ARCH BANANAS AND INVESTORS
REGIONAL ATTACK FINDS WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF CHALLENGES HERE COMMUNICATION IN ENGLISH FOR EXAMPLE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE
VARYING LIES ALSO OPPORTUNITIES THERE'S THIS NINETY MILLION MARKET MANY OF WHOM ARE ON FACEBOOK AND ONLINE
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS THAT'S ALL WE CAN BE GROWN
AS AS B. AND I'M CONTINUES TO DEVELOP THE MESS IN THE WIND I KNOW IT'S VERY DIDN'T VIEW BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE
YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS IS BASICALLY AN ALUMINIUM AND YET HERE YOU ARE
IT WAS YOUR PARENTS WHO LEFT BUT THEY ASKED YOU TO COME BACK TO RUN THE VIETNAMESE OPERATION HOW DID YOU FEEL
AS STRANGE AS FIRST FOR ME
I DID SOME RESEARCH MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO SEE HOW THE CORE CHEER IN THE EXPANDING
THE VIENNESE QUARTERING GARROW ACCEPTING NEW CHANGE
THE WORLD HAS MOVING FROM CHINA TO VIETNAM LIVING HAD SO MANY OF THE TOUR AND NEED GROWL
FOR ME THAT'S LIKE THAT IT PLAYS FROM ME TOO
JOIN JOINT
BECAUSE VIETNAM IS CHEAPER THAT CHINA IN TERMS OF LATE I'VE GOT TO ME BUT HERE YOU ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG WOMAN
AND NOT ONLY IN ITS EARLY MALE TRADITIONAL MALE SOCIETY BUT ALSO THAT OPINION WHICH ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD IT'S VERY MALE DOMINANT DOWN
WAS AGAIN STRANGE TO BE PART OF IT AT FIRST
WHEN I CAME BACK AND BE VERY RUN IT AND THE PORCH
THE DATA THAT START SEEING BUSINESS PARTNERS RAILWAY
FIRST THEY LOOK AT ME REALLY STRANGELY IS THEY'RE VERY YOUNG WOMEN TO BE IN THE SUCH DOMINATED MILL INDUSTRY
STARTED TO MAKE MYSELF A ORDER COMING TO ME WITH THEIR NEW PARTNERS
YOU GIVE THEM THE IMPRESSION
HOWEVER THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS IS FAIR
BECAUSE VIETNAM GROWING SO
THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT
THEREFORE THEY REALLY OPEN MINDED ABOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS ABOUT YOU
AGE PICTURE
WHAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN HEARING THIS MORNING IS THE FEAR FROM MANY COUNTRIES ABOUT LARGE MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU SPEAK TO PEOPLE IN
THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE COS THEY SAY IT'S CREATIVE AND YET SO MANY MORE TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES AND COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY AND FAR MORE FEARFUL ANDREW
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE TENSIONS THAT THE TENSIONS THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NOT IN THE TECH THAT SECTOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT BEING ALMOST
BRAINSTORMING AND PEOPLE COMING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO DO
BUT IT'S THAT MIX OF PEOPLE THAT ALSO CAN CREATE TENSIONS IN A SOCIETY IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WERE AWARE
I THINK WHEN FOREIGNERS COME HERE
THEY'RE INVITED THEY'RE VERY WELCOME BY THE LOCAL
AND I JUST ON HERE IN HAUPTMANN CITY BUT IN THERE AS WELL
MANY CLOSE FRIENDS THERE AND I'VE HEARD SOME GREAT RELATIONSHIPS BOTH PROFESSION
AND FOR BOTH OF YOU IS THERE A SENSE OF STABILITY

REAL ESTATE THAT AS THE STABILITY THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
ANDREW ROOM YEAH SO AS THE ITALIAN CONTINUES GROW WE'LL SEE MORE SUCCESSFUL
