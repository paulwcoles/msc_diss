THIS YEAR MAZE MOST EYE CATCHING SOLUTIONS ARE THOUGHT TO INCLUDE OPENING UP SUPPLIERS CUSTOMER DATABASES TO RIVALS SO HOUSEHOLDS CAN BE DIRECTLY TARGETED WITH BETTER OFFERS
BUT THE C.M.A. ALSO BELIEVE SOME CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T SWITCH NEED PROTECTING SO IT'S EXPECTED TO PROPOSE AND LOOSE SAFEGUARD TO HALF FOR VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS WHICH COULD MEAN CHEAPER BILLS FOR THE FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT USE PRE PAYMENT METERS
THESE WOULD BE MAJOR INTERVENTIONS AND OUR ENERGY MARKET AND THE C.M.A. WILL PROPOSE A HOST OF OTHER REMEDIES TO DAVID CAMERON IS AIMING TO STRESS THE BENEFITS OF STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION DURING HIS CAMPAIGNING TODAY BUT A MEMBER OF HIS CABINET CHRIS GRAYLING WILL ARGUE THAT BRITAIN SHOULD WITHDRAWN BECAUSE THE E.U.

LOUISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPER AND AFTER THE SUN YESTERDAY SAID THAT HAD A HEADLINE QUEEN BACKS BRECK'S IT SUGGESTING THAT AS A RESULT OF COMMENT SHE MUST BE SUPPORTING BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. THE TELEGRAPH TODAY FOCUSES ON MICHAEL GO SUGGESTING THAT HE'S FACING QUESTIONS AS A RESULT OF THAT STORY SUGGESTING
THAT HE'S BEEN IMPLICATED AT THE LEAKING THE DETAILS OF THE THE PRIVATE CONVERSATION SUGGESTING THAT THE QUEEN FAVOURS LEAVING THE E.U. HE REFUSED TO DENY REFUSE DENIED THAT HE WAS THE SOURCE OF A LEAK EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE QUEEN AND FOUR MEMBERS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN
BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS ISSUED A COMPLAINT TO THE PRESS COMPLAINTS WATCHDOG ABOUT THE REPORT AND INSISTED THE QUEEN WAS POLITICALLY NEUTRAL HOWEVER IN THE SUN THEY ARE VERY MUCH DEFENDING THEIR STORY IN FACT THEY'RE HAVING GREAT FUN WITH IT THEY POINT OUT THAT YOU GO OUT OF THE POSTERS
SAY THAT WOMEN AGED OVER SIXTY WITHOUT A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION BACK LEAVING THE E.U. BY SEVENTY THREE PER CENT OF THE QUEEN OF COURSE FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY AND TREVOR CAN HAVE AN NOW THEY'RE COLONISTS AS THE SOURCE OF OUR STORY IS IMMACULATE IT HAS BEEN STOOD UP BY A SECOND SOURCE DOES THE QUEEN BELIEVE IN BRITISH SOVEREIGNTY YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO ASK
THE TIMES LEADS ON THOSE ISLAMIC SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN LEAGUE THOUSANDS OF THEM WHICH AND IT MAKES THE POINT ABOUT HOW THE WHAT A BONUS THEY ARE TO SECURITY SERVICES TWIN THEY ARE ALLEGED TO CONTAIN THE NAMES ADDRESSES AND FAMILY CONTACTS OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND JIHADIST FIGHTERS INCLUDING AT LEAST A DOZEN BRITISH RECRUITS IN THAT LEAGUE HELD AS A SEVERE SETBACK FOR ISIS OR BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SO MUCH INFORMATION
QUOTE FROM A FILM WILL GET US HE'S FROM INTERNATIONAL CORPORATE PROTECTION A THREAT MANAGEMENT COMPANY SAID IT IF IT IF IT WAS VERIFIED IT'S A MAJOR BLOW THERE'LL BE A MASSIVE CRISIS MODE HE SAYS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S IN THERE WHO'S IN THEN HURDLE DISRUPT WHAT THEY DO FOR THE BOSS OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BOOKMAKERS HAS ACCUSED MINISTERS ARE TURNING A BLIND EYE TO A WIDESPREAD ADDICTION TO GAMBLING MACHINES BECAUSE OF THE MILLIONS THAT THEY RAISE IN TAXES THIS IS ACCORDING TO
THE TIMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE FINTON DRURY CHAIRMAN OF PADDY PART OF HER SIX YEARS UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TEN WRITING IN THE PAPER SAYING THAT ARE TROUBLING PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY HAD ALLOWED THE GROWTH OF FIXED DOGS BETTING TERMINALS WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE CRACK COCAINE OF GAMBLING AND HE SAYS THE TIMES AS HELP BRING TO LIGHT SOME OF THE WORST EXCESSES RELATED TO THOSE MACHINES
JUST ONE THING BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO A FORMER EDITOR OF THIS OF THIS PROGRAMME IS IN HIS COLUMN IN THE SUN OR DONE A KIM KARDASHIAN IF THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY SIMILAR RESULTS I'M SURE
WIDELY VIEWED ALL THE OTHER EDITORS WILL BE THEY COULD SELFIES JEALOUS TEMPAH SEVEN CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED THAT THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO TRY TO CLOSE A NEW CAMP FOR MIGRANTS SET UP WITH THE AID AGENCY MEDICINE FRONT M.S.F. THE CAMP IN DUNKIRK HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE FIRST THAT MEETS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS SINCE THE MIGRANT CRISIS BEGAN RICHARD GAP CABINETS AT CORRESPOND WHO'S THERE WHAT'S HAPPENING
WELL ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT A WHOLE GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL AND FRENCH AID AGENCIES AND ORGANISATIONS HAVE PUBLISHED AN OPEN LETTER CONDEMNING THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S THEY ARE ACCUSING IT'S OF TRYING TO GET THE CAMP CLOSED DOWN AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT THEY'RE USING FIRE REGULATIONS AND SECURITY REGULATIONS WHICH THEY'RE SAYING AND HAVE NOT BEEN MET AT THE CAMP AS A MEANS OF GETTING IT CLOSED DOWN THEY'RE ALSO SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S HAS THREATENED THEM
OF THIS OF THE AREA IN DUNKIRK WHO SUPPORTED THE BUILDING THE COUNT WITH PROSECUTION SO THEY ARE VERY ANGRY AND OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO WHIP UP A PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN TO TRY AND STOP THIS HAPPENING BUT IS IT I MEAN IS THERE A REAL THREAT THAT IT DOES HAPPEN ANY DAY
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S IT'S SUPPOSED TO THE BUILDING OF THIS CAMP IT DID NOTHING TO HELP IT BEING BUILT AND CERTAINLY M.S.F. FOR EXAMPLE METZ FRANCE YES STUMPED UP ALMOST ALL THEIR MONEY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION EUROS
I THINK THE POINT IS THAT AT THIS CAMP I THINK WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT AT THE CAMP THERE ARE NO REGULATIONS WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO REGISTER THEY DON'T HAVE TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN FRANCE THEY DON'T THE HE IS IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM THEREFORE TO KEEP TABS ON THEM AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT MANY OF THESE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE
TRY TO REACH WRITTEN THERE ARE SOME FIGURES FLOATING AROUND SAYING THAT'S AROUND ABOUT ONE THOUSAND MIGRANTS MANAGED TO GET THROUGH FROM THIS AREA FROM A NORTHERN FRANCE TO BRITAIN OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO HIM YESTERDAY SPEAKING TO LORRAINE IRANIAN MAN
HE SAID THAT HE'D TRIED SEVEN TIMES TO GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL SMUGGLED IN THE BOOT OF A CAR AND FAILED EACH TIME AND I SAID TO TRY AGAIN HE SAID YES I'M GOING TO BE TRYING AGAIN NEXT WEEK SO CLEARLY ALL OF THEM SO ALL THE PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO D'YOU WANT TO TRY AND GET OUT OF BRITAIN AND IT SEEMS THEY'RE DETERMINED TO TRY TO GET THERE BY WHATEVER MEANS RICHARD THANKS
IT'S NOW THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX AND SEND SUE CHEESE PARTY IN MY MA'LL BURMA HAS PUT FORWARD THE NAME OF TWO PEOPLE WHO IT SAID HE'S PROPOSING AS PRESIDENT WHOEVER IT IS WOULD RULE AS HER PROXY JENNA FISHER IS OUR CORRESPONDENT OUTSIDE THE PARLIAMENT THERE AND JONAH WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THESE TWO THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ELECTED PRESIDENT
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S A FORMALITY THAT WHOEVER I'M SENSING A CHEESE PARTY PUTS FORWARD FOR PRESIDENT WILL BE CONFIRMED IN THAT ROLE SUCH IS THE SCALE
OF THEIR DOMINANCE OF PARLIAMENT HERE AND THE CHOICE SWITCH ON SENSES YEARS GONE FOR IS SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO HER A PERSONAL FRIEND SOMEONE WHO WAS A CLOSE CONFIDANTE OF HER DURING HER LONG YEARS UNDER HOUSE ARREST IT'S A MAN CALLED TIN DRAW AN OXFORD GRADUATES BUT HIS QUALIFICATIONS PROBABLY HAVEN'T COUNTED FOR THAT MUCH THE KEY
ISSUE FOR UNDERSTAND SUE CHI IN CHOOSING THIS PRESIDENTIAL PIG HAS BEEN TO FIND SOMEONE WHO SHE CAN TRUST SOMEONE SHE CAN RELY ON AND CRUCIALLY SOMEONE WHO WILL DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD BECAUSE THOUGH SHE'S BEEN BARRED FROM TAKING THE PRESIDENCY HERSELF MISS OOTY HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT SHE'D STILL INTENDS TO LEAD THIS GOVERNMENT AND EFFECTIVELY THIS PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE ORDERS FROM HER AND THERE HAD BEEN BUT SHE HAD HOPED THAT THERE WAS AN OPTION THAT SHE COULD THEY COULD CHANGE THE RULES TO ALLOW HER TO BE PRESIDENT
THAT'S RIGHT THEY WERE TRYING RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MINUTE A WEEK OR A WEEK OR SO AGO THERE WERE STILL TALKS GOING ON BETWEEN HER AND THE BURMESE MILITARY SHE WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM TO SUSPEND THE CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION WHICH BARS FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT SHE'S BARRED BECAUSE HER TWO SONS UP FROM THE THE OXFORD ACADEMIC MICHAEL ARIS
I BASICALLY HAD BRITISH PASSPORTS NOT BURMESE PASSPORTS THAT DISQUALIFIES SHE'D BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME SORT OF WAY AROUND IT MAYBE THEY COULD SUSPEND THE CLAWS TEMPORARILY AMENDED AT A LATER DATE BUT THE ARMY'S SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN HER A PRETTY FIRM RESPONSE THAT THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN DOING THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO STICK TO THE RULES OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY DRAFTED THAT MEANS NO PRESIDENT SOO CHEE AT LEAST FOR NOW
WE'RE NOW GOING TO HAVE A PROXY IN PLACE MOST LIKELY TIN DRAW IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER ON CITIES PARTY WILL TRY AND REVISIT THIS PERHAPS IN A YEAR OR TWO PERHAPS NOT TRY AND PERSUADE THE ARMY TO CHANGE ITS POSITION AND THAT WE MIGHT EVENTUALLY STILL SEE A PRESIDENT'S HOOCHIE THOUGH AT THE MOMENT THAT SEEMS QUITE A LONG SHOT
JENNA FISHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT ABOUT SIX TIME FOR THE BUSINESS DOMINATED THIS MORNING LISA MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS BY THE U.K.'S ENERGY FIRMS WHO FACE WELL WHAT MATTHEW PRICE IS HERE MORNING I THINK DO YOU DO YOU SWITCH ENERGY SUPPLIER JUST EVERY YEAR WORLD THERE MIGHT BE MORE LIKE YOU BECAUSE IT'S THOUGHT LIKELY THAT ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IS GOING TO BE PISSED TO PERSUADE MORE PEOPLE TO SWITCH ENERGY SUPPLIER WILL BE COVERING THAT IN DEPTH THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME ALSO IN THERE I DO ALL DAY TO DO IT WHAT'S THAT
I SUSPECT THAT THERE WERE INDEED NOT OR NOT EVERYBODY HAS TIME DO THEY I CERTAINLY DON'T EITHER I SHOULD MAKE TIME ALSO IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HIGH STREET OF THAT VOTE NOT TO LET COUNSEL'S EXTEND SUNDAY TRADING LAWS IN ENGLAND AND WALES FIRST THOSE SET YOUR WATCHES FOR SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT'S WHEN ONE OF OUR REGULATORS THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY WILL TELL US HOW HE PROPOSES TO STOP US ALL HAVING TO PAY TOO MUCH FOR ENERGY LAST YEAR THE C.M.A. SAID EACH HOUSEHOLD
HE'S BEING OVERCHARGED ON AVERAGE FORTY POUNDS A YEAR THAT'S AN ANNUAL TOTAL INCOME OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION POUNDS EXTRA FOR THE ENERGY FIRMS WELL CATHERINE WHAT UMS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA IS AN EXPERT ON THE U.K. ENERGY MARKET AND ITS REGULATION GOOD MORNING CATHERINE GOOD MORNING IN BULLET POINT FORM WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FROM THE C.M.A. LATER
I THINK THE MOST LIKELY THING IS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME
REGULATION IMPOSED ON PROBABLY PREPAYMENT METER USERS IN THE RETAIL MARKET THAT'S GOING TO MAKE CUSTOMERS WELL MORE A CUSTOMER THERE ARE MORE OF THEM ARE POOR AND VULNERABLE BUT THERE ARE POOR AND VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS WHO AREN'T PREPAYMENT METER USERS AND A PRE PAYMENT METER USERS WHO ARE POOR AND VULNERABLE SO IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S A PROXY BUT IT'S NOT A VERY EXACT ONE RIGHT AND I MENTIONED SWITCHING HOWARD HOW WERE THEY THOUGHT LIKELY TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE EVEN MORE PEOPLE TO SWITCH COS QUITE A FEW ARE ALREADY
YES MORE PEOPLE ARE SWITCHING OUR RESEARCH AT THE CENTRE COMPETITION POLICY SHOWS THAT THIS HUGE VARIETY AMONGST US IN TERMS OF HOW WILLINGLY WE SWITCH HOW HOW MUCH WE WANT TO SWITCH ON THAT AND THE SORT OF THINGS THAT WILL MAKE A SWITCH MORE SO FOR SOME OF US BETTER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WILL DO IT FOR OTHERS THAT'S NOT THE THING THAT WILL ENCOURAGE SWITCHING
SO I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO IDENTIFY ANY BARRIERS THAT THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE AND ALMOST CERTAINLY BARRIERS TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION TO SWITCHING EITHER REAL OR IMAGINED AND YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND TACKLE THAT
I THINK THEY WILL TRY AND TACKLE IT I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY LOTS OF US DON'T SWITCH OR DON'T SWITCH AS OFTEN AS WE SHOULD DO AND IT'S NOT JUST IN ENERGY AND SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING I THINK OF EXACTLY WHY IT IS THAT WE MAY FEEL THERE ARE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH OUR TIME
THE FORTY POUNDS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE MIGHT GAIDEN JUST ISN'T WORTH IT FOR LOTS OF US O. K. KATHERINE STAY THERE BUT I JUST WANNA COME TO A JAMES BEVAN A MARKETS GUESS JAMES WHO'S THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AT SEA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IT'S A TRICKY TIME FOR ENERGY FIRMS ISN'T IT WE POWER HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR JOB CAN'T SEE ON ARE POSTED ANOTHER RECORD LOSS
THIS TODAY PRESUMABLY HE'S GOING TO PUT MORE PRESSURE ON THE BIG FIRMS IT CERTAINLY DOES ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THAT HE'S BEEN COMING AS WELL UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OR NOT MUCH SURPRISE THE ENERGY COMPANIES THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN BENEFITING FROM FOLLOWER INPUT COSTS
AND OBVIOUSLY THE TARIFFS THAT WE ALL PAY HAVE NOT FORMED BY ANYTHING LIKE THE AMOUNT THE GLOBAL ENERGY PRICES HAVE FALLEN GENERALLY SAYS NOT ALL BAD NEWS BUT CLEARLY THERE IS CONSIDERABLE CONCERN IN THE MARKET PLACE OR BAD YES ANOTHER ROUND OF MEASURES AND KATHERINE I MEAN THIS IS ALL PARTLY DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE GROSS OF GROWTH OF SMALLER ENERGY FIRMS THE BIG SIX ARE STILL NINETY PER CENT OF THE MARKET IN THE U.K. DO YOU THINK THAT WILL CHANGE
WELL IT HAS CHANGED REMARKABLY I DON'T THINK A FEW YEARS AGO WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE MARKET SHALL WE DO NOW FROM THE NEW ENTRANCE SO I THINK DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE THEM IS GOOD THEY HAVEN'T HISTORICALLY DONE SO WELL WHEN WHOLESALE PRICES GO UP AND SO I THINK WE MIGHT
NEED TO WAIT AND SEE EXACTLY HOW RESILIENT THEY ARE WHEN THE MARKET'S CHANGED IN THAT DIRECTION O.K. JUST A JUST A QUICK ONE VERY QUICKLY OUT OF INTEREST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM DOES THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY POWER TO CONTROL OUR ENERGY PRICES HERE IN THE U.K. NO IT DOESN'T I DO SO WELL I KNOW WHAT A QUICK ONE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR DOING SO BACK TO YOU JAMES BEVAN
AND THE ENERGY SECTOR WAS DE REGULATED AND HAS BEEN DE REGULATED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS SINCE BRITISH GAS WAS PRIVATISED BACK IN EIGHTY SIX
THAT THE THOUGHTS TODAY A PRICE CONTROLS POSSIBLY MORE REGULATION HAD A MARKET'S REACTOR THAT MARKETS I THINK RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS A STRUCTURAL REALITY THAT SOME INDUSTRIES ARE MUCH LESS CAPABLE OF BEING GENUINELY COMPETITIVE THAN OTHERS THIS IS ALL ABOUT TWEAKING THE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THE CUSTOMER GETS THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND INEVITABLY SOME COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT
OH KAY INVESTORS OF COURSE DO LOVE INNOVATION SO LET'S JUST TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TO ALISTAIR MARTIN WHO'S SITTING NEXT TO YOU ALISTAIR YOU'RE THE FOUNDER OF ONE OF THE FIRMS WHICH I SUPPOSE A LITTLE LIKE THE COMPETITION OR MARKETS AUTHORITY TODAY IS TRYING TO SHAKE UP THE ENERGY MARKET THE FIRM FERMI'S FLEX CITRUS SETTEE
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE FOUNDERS I MEAN JUST TELL ME BRIEFLY WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO HOW ARE YOU SHAKING UP THE WAY THE ENERGY IS SUPPLIED TO US YEAH THANKS FLEX ATROCITY IS AS A BIG RED BUTTON SERVICE FOR A NATIONAL GRID WHAT WE DO IS WE PROVIDE NATIONAL GRID WITH ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR ENERGY CONSUMERS AND THE ABILITY TO TURN DOWN THEIR CONSUMPTION AT SHORT NOTICE
NATIONAL GRID NEEDS MORE PAIN WHAT THERE'S A POWER STATION FAILURE IF THERE'S A DEMAND RISES FASTER THAN EXPECTED THEN THEY CAN TURN DON'T CONSUMPTION TURN ON SMALL GENERATORS WE ORGANISE ALL THESE ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL RESOURCES INTO LARGE POWER STATION SIZED LUMPS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE GRID AT THE TOP LEVEL RIGHT SO YOU'RE MONITORING HOW MUCH A FACTORY OR A BUSINESS CONSUMES IN THE WAY OF ENERGY HOW DO YOU THEN TURN DOWN WHAT THEY'RE USING WE HAVE CONNECTIONS TO RECITE THE PARTICIPATES WE A MACHINE TO MACHINE WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CONTROL ROOM OPERATING IN EDINBURGH
WE MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON WE KNOW WHAT THAT SITE CAN DO WITHOUT DISRUPTING ITS CORE BUSINESS AND SO FOR EXTRA SETTEES JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS TURNED DOWN WITHOUT DISRUPTION
EXACTLY WHEN NATIONAL WHAT WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE COMPANIES THEY GET PAID YOU GET PAID FOR TURNING DOWN THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION ABSOLUTELY ISN'T ENTIRELY COMMERCIAL PROPOSITION IS THERE ANY FALL OUT FOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK HE'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS C.M.A. ANALYSIS TODAY IS
THE IDEA AS KATHARINE WAS JUST SAYING THERE THAT THE BIG ENERGY COMPANIES WILL HAVE LESS DOMINANCE OVER THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM IT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY GONNA HELPS FIRM SMALLER CONCERNS LIKE YOURS ARE PROBABLY ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GO QUITE AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE WHICH THE WHAT THE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SEPARATION BETWEEN RETAIL SUPPLIERS AND MAJOR POWER STATIONS
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THE SUPPLIERS WOULD BE ACTING REALLY IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND THEY WOULD BE HARNESSING ALL THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY COULD FIND TO HELP THE THAT ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND GET THE BEST PRICE THAT WOULD RESULT IN A CHEAPER AND GREENER
ALL RIGHT ALISTAIR MARTIN FROM FLEX INTERESTED THANKS VERY MUCH JAMES BEVAN FROM C. C.L.A. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BACK TO YOU THE OTHER BIG NEWS TODAY OTHER THAN ENERGY IS GOING TO BE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IT CERTAINLY IS I MEAN MARIO DRUGGY THE PRESIDENT FOR A BANK HAS BEEN THROWING EVERYTHING HE'S GOT AT TRYING TO REJUVENATE THE EUROZONE ECONOMY IT LOOKED QUITE GOOD AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR DIDN'T IT MEANT BY THE END OF LAST YEAR ACTUALLY THEY WERE BACK SEEMINGLY HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS HAS HE GOT ANYTHING LEFT HE CAN THROW
YOU CAN CARRY ON WITH CONCEITED EASING HE CAN TAKE INTEREST RATES YET MORE NEGATIVE IS YOU DISCUSSED YESTERDAY THAT THE HARD REALITY IS THAT AS A CENTRAL BANK HE DOESN'T CONTROL FISCAL POLICY HE DOESN'T CONTROL THE UNRAVELLING OF RED TAPE AND HE IS IN A GLOBAL MAIL STRIM OF OVERPRODUCTION PRINCIPALLY FROM THE MERCIA ECONOMIES WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIS INFLATIONARY OR DE FRESHENER SO HE HAS A HARD TASK I MEAN I'D SPENT
MUCH OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS WORKING OUT OF BRUSSELS AND WITH WITH THE E.C. C. IN BRUSSELS TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW TO CREATE A BETTER MONETARY UNION TO INVESTORS BELIEVE THAT THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARDS THAT NO I THINK THE MOST PEOPLE WOULD STILL REGARD THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS CONSTRUCT INAPPROPRIATE THE TARGET TO MONEY SYSTEM TECHNICALLY IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM IN THE U.S. AND THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW
IN THE WAY THAT IT'S ALL PUT TOGETHER A QUICK ONE THE SUNDAY TRADING VOTE YESTERDAY DO YOU THINK IT HAS ANY IMPACT FOR HIGH STREET FIRMS ABSOLUTELY IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND HE'S CLEARLY GOING TO RUN AND RUN ALL RIGHT WHEN I ASK BECAUSE OF THIS
THE AYES TO THE RIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THE NOSE THE LEFT TWO HUNDRED EIGHT
THAT WAS EM PEAS REJECTING PLANS TO LET COUNSEL'S EXTEND SUNDAY TRADING HOURS CLAIRE RAYNER IS A RETAIL EXPERT FROM THE RETAIL CHAMPION DOT CO DOT U.K. GOOD MORNING CLAIRE GOOD MORNING HOW BIG A DEAL YOU HEARD FROM JAMES THERE THAT IT IS A BIG DEAL FOR HIGH STREETS HAVE HAD BIGGER DEAL IS IT IN TERMS OF THE RETAIL SECTOR OVERALL
I THINK IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL I MEAN WHAT'S BASICALLY BEEN REJECTED IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THE CHOICE TO OPEN LONGER HOURS NO I WAS GOING TO BE FORCED AND IT WAS GOING TO BE MODERATED AT LOCAL LEVEL TO DEPENDENT ON LOCAL DEMAND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE YEARS THOUGH IS THE TRADITIONAL RETAIL OPENING HOURS YOU KNOW NINE TO FIVE MONDAY TO SATURDAY THEY AREN'T REALLY CUTTING IT FOR THE SECTOR CERTAINLY FOOTFALL IN HIGH STREETS HAS BEEN DOWN TWENTY SIX PER CENT OVER TRADITIONAL HOURS AND YET IT'S INCREASED IN EVENINGS SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS IN PARTICULAR
I BELIEVE BUT HAVING AT THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE TO OPEN LONGER SHOULD THERE BE THE DEMAND WOULD HAVE REALLY HELPED IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE INCREASED SALES THAT DRAMATICALLY BUT I THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE FELT MORE INCLINED TO SHOP IN PHYSICAL RETAIL AND THE KNOCK ON EFFECT IS REALLY POSITIVE FOR THE HIGH STREET WE MENTION PHYSICAL RETAIL THEY'RE MEAN FOR THE CONSUMER
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER DOES IT WE'RE ALL SHOPPING ONLINE NOW BUT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE CRAZINESS OF THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS THAT WE CAN SHOP ONLINE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN GOODS CAN BE DELIVERED BY A SUPERMARKET OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL TRADING HOURS AN SEOCAN COURIERS SO REALLY TO NOT BE ALLOWED TO OPEN SEAMS IN CONFLICT WITH THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY SPEND MONEY BUT
AND LET ME PICK YOU UP ON THAT I MEAN SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR OUR PHYSICAL HIGH STREETS DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE SHOPS SHUTTING DOWN AN EMPTY EMPTY BUSINESSES ON THE HIGH STREET I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT DIRECTS AN IMPACT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT WHEN LARGE RETAILERS AND OBVIOUSLY SMALL RETAILERS CAN OPEN WITHOUT RESTRAINT ON ANY SUNDAY
BUT WHEN LARGER RETAILERS ARE OPEN IN AN AREA IT CREATES A MORE CONSISTENT CONSUMER OFFER AND THE KNOCK ON EFFECT IS PEOPLE THINK WILL THAT PLACE IS A PLACE WHERE I CAN GET EVERYTHING I NEED SO THEY WILL GO THERE THE FOOTBALL WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE LARGE RETAILERS AND THE KNOCK ON EFFECT IS THAT THE SMALLER RETAILERS BENEFIT FROM THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVE AROUND BUT WHEN THEY'RE UNDER TIME PRESSURE
THEY JUST ALMOST TREAT THEIR SHOPPING RIGHT MUST DASH TO THE SHOPS GET WHAT I NEED AND GET HOME AND I THINK THAT RELAXING THE HOURS WOULD HAVE MADE THINGS A LITTLE BIT EASIER MAYBE MADE PEOPLE SPENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER IN A TOWN CENTRE SHOPPING CENTRE OR WHEREVER AND HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A KNOCK ON BENEFIT TO THE SMALLER BUSINESSES CLAIRE RAYNER THANKS VERY MUCH JUST A QUICK UPDATE ON A STORY WE BROUGHT YOU YESTERDAY THOSE SUITCASES THAT LOOK LIKE ANIMALS AND YOUR CHILDREN CAN SIT ON THEM AS YOU PULL THEM ALONG WELL THE DESIGNER OF THE ORIGINAL ONE THE TRUNK HE LOST HIS CASE

THE AYE AYE IS CALLING FOR MORE MONEY TO BE PUT ASIDE IN NEXT WEEK'S BUDGET TO MEND ROADS THE MOTORING ORGANISATION ESTIMATES THAT ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF DRIVERS HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR CARS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AFTER HITTING POTHOLES THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S ALREADY PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN ROADS
IT'S NOT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN BUS WAS SAYING IN HALF AN HOUR THE COMPETITION OR MARKETS AUTHORITY WAS SET OUT HOW HE PROPOSES TO STOP PEOPLE BEING CHARGED TOO MUCH BY THE ENERGY COMPANIES JOHN MODERN IS OUR INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT CORRESPONDENT AND JOHN THEY HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY SAID WHAT A YEAR AGO THAT WE'RE ALL BEING CHARGED MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS TOO MUCH HOW THEY WOULD OF THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE PROPOSING TO TACKLE
SO THAT THE INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT GOT THIS DOCUMENT AT SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING WE GET AT SEVEN BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL AS YOU SAY POINT OUT THAT PEOPLE IN THE IN THE ENERGY MARKET WHO WERE ON FIXED PRICE DEALS AT THE MOMENT BUT THEY'RE BENEFITING FROM A COMPETITIVE MARKET BUT OVERALL THE PEOPLE WHO SET ONTO THE STANDARD VARIABLE TARIFFS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS THEY DON'T BENEFIT
AS YOU SEE IT LAST YEAR THAT THE C.M.A. POINTED OUT THAT THESE PEOPLE AND MICRO BUSINESSES HAD HAD SPENT MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS MORE FOR ENERGY AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE IF THE MARKET WAS COMPETITIVE SO TWO BIG EYE CATCHING IDEAS TO TRY AND TURN THINGS AROUND NUMBER ONE
THERE WILL BE AN OFT DATABASE WHICH WILL ALLOW RIVAL SUPPLIERS TO CONTACT CUSTOMERS
SORT OF WORDS THE BIG FIRMS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE CUSTOMERS' DETAILS IF YOU'VE BEEN ON A STANDARD TARIFF FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE SO THAT WILL RESULT IN MORE PEOPLE MORPH MORE MORE RIVAL FIRMS PROMPTING YOU WITH MUCH BETTER DEALS AND TO TRY AND PERSUADE YOU TO SWITCH
THE SECOND BIG IDEA THAT'S IN THERE IS THE IDEA OF WHAT'S CALLED THE TRANSITIONAL PRICE CONTROL
THAT WILL AFFECT FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WHICH ARE ON PRE PAYMENT METERS IT'S A TEMPORARY MEASURE IT'S LIKELY TO LAST UP AND TILT TWENTY TWENTY WHEN SMITE ME METERS COME IN WHEN PEOPLE SHOULD GET MUCH MORE VISIBILITY BY THE KIND OF ENERGY THEY'RE USING ET-CETERA SO THERE'S TWO BIG IDEAS
AND I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL THEY WORK OUT WHERE AND HOW BIG ARE THEY GOING TO BE SEEN TO BE BY THE INDUSTRY WELL THEY'RE VERY INTERVENTIONIST AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRICE CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE
FIRMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRICE WHAT THEY WHAT THEY LIKE FOR ENERGY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TO LIBERAL LIZA ENERGY MARKET AND YET HERE WE ARE GOING BACK TO A SITUATION WHERE SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO BE PROTECTED FROM HIGH PRICES AND WERE INTRODUCING A PRICE AT ALL AND THE MARKET SO THEY ARE I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS THIS
THIS ENTIRE DEBATE THAT'S RAGED ON FOR YEARS AND IT WAS A BIT SORT OF HEIGHTS BACK AND TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THE LABOUR PROPOSE IN THE FREEZE ENERGY PRESS SUCCESS IS THAT ATTENDS LIKE YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO MAGIC BULLET TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THERE ARE SEVENTY PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE ON STANDARD TARIFFS MANY DON'T SWITCH AND IF THEY DID THEY COULD SAVE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR SO IT'S ABOUT HAVING TO CHANGE CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR
THAT'S WHERE THERE'LL BE THIS IDEA OF TRYING TO PROMPT THE SOIL MORE BY GETTING RIVALS TO DUCK DIRECTLY MARKET TO US BUT IT IS ON TAP UNTRIED AND ON TESTED AND HE COULD ACTUALLY END UP WITH A LOT OF US BEING INUNDATED WITH JUNK MAIL
JOHN BOYLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEREAS JOHN SAYS WE'LL KNOW IN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TIME AND IT'S A STORY WILL BE FOLLOWING THROUGH THE MORNING FOUND OUT TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING WHO'S CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH TODAY IN WHICH HE SUGGESTS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER'S RENEGOTIATION DEAL DID NOT RETURN ENOUGH POWER TO PARLIAMENT AND ALMOST WITH A SYSTEM THAT IT HAS ON THE LINE QUITE A TRENCHANT INTERVENTION THIS
IT IS WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT IT SEEMS TO ME IS A SCROLLING WANTS TO FOCUS ATTENTION BACK ON THE DEAL THE LONG LOST DEAL WHICH HAS KIND OF GOT LOST AND ALL THE HURLY BURLY AND SOUND AND FURY AND FEAR AND LOATHING OF THIS CAMPAIGN BUT WHICH THE BRICKS ARE TEARS SAY WAS MEANT TO BE WHAT THIS REFERENDUM WAS ABOUT THE REFORMED PACKAGE
THAT MISTER CAMERON NEGOTIATED TODAY MISTER GREYLING WILL SAY THAT IT HAS FAILED IN ITS CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF GETTING POWERS BACK TO BRITAIN PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT DID NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE WHICH MEANS WHOLE SWATHES OF BRITISH LIFE ARE STILL SHAPED AND DETERMINED BY THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT RATHER THAN BRITISH COURTS HE WILL ARGUE THAT IT DID NOT REVERSE THE FUNDAMENTAL THRUST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH IS TOWARDS GREATER
POLITICAL INTEGRATION INDEED HE WILL SUGGESTED IT'S PERHAPS MADE THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE BECAUSE BURIED IN THE TEXT OF THE DEAL IT'S AN AGREEMENT TO QUOTES NOT IMPEDE MOVES TOWARDS GREATER POLITICAL COHESION AMONGST THE EUROZONE WHICH HE SAYS HAS REMOVED A CRUCIAL BARGAINING LEVER FROM THE HANDS OF THE BRITISH BUT WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT IT IS I SENSE THERE IS A DESIRE AMONGST THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNED TO GET BACK TO THE ISSUE NOT JUST OF THE DEAL BUT OF SOVEREIGNTY
I WONDER IF THEY FEEL THAT IS A MORE COMFORTABLE ISSUE FOR THEM ON THEY CAN WIN MORE EASILY ON THEY BELIEVE THAT SAY ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE ECONOMY OR SECURITY OR MAYBE EVEN IMMIGRATION TO DO WE SHOULD MENTION AS WELL THE ROW BETWEEN THE PALACE ONE BETWEEN ALL COMERS HOWEVER THE SUN STORY ABOUT THE QUEEN'S VIEWS ON THE EUROPEAN UNION DID IT DOES LOOK QUITE A SERIOUS ONE DOESN'T INASMUCH AS THE PALACE OF FORMALLY COMPLAINED IN THE SUN THIS MORNING VERY STRONGLY STICKING BY THEIR STORY WE SEEM TO BE IN
A BIT OF A SORT OF MEXICAN STAND OFF WITH NO ONE SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGING CULPABILITY NICK CLEGG WE'VE COURSE REJECTING SUGGESTIONS THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MICHAEL GO FOR HE'S BEEN FINGERED BY MANY AS BEING THE POTENTIAL SOURCE OF THIS STORY REFUSING TO COMMENT ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE QUEEN THE SOME STANDING BY THE STORY AND THE PALACE OF COURSE REFERRING THE MATTER TO THE PRESS WATCHDOG I MEAN
I THINK THE COMIC CONSENSUS AT WESTMINSTER APPEARS TO BE TO BE THIS STUDDED IS QUITE
PLAUSIBLE THAT THE QUEEN MAY HAVE VENTED HER HIGHER ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE E. U. BUT WHETHER SHE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE SUGGESTED SHE BACKED
LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PERHAPS THE STRETCH OF ONLY BECAUSE HER WHOLE RAIN SHE HAS METICULOUSLY AVOIDED ANY TAKE TAKING ANY POLITICAL SIDE NONE THANKS AND WILL BE TALKING TO CHRIS GRAYLING AT SON HUH
IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN IRELAND'S NEW PARLIAMENT WILL MEET TODAY AND THEY SHOULD BE ELECTING A NEW PRIME MINISTER BUT THAT LOOKS UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT THEY STILL HAVEN'T FORMED A GOVERNMENT CHRIS BUTLER IS OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS WHAT HAPPENS TODAY
YOU BREAK DOWN THE FIGURES THIS IS A REALLY DIVIDED PARLIAMENT ANOTHER MAKE SELECTING THE NEW T. CAN YOU PRIME MINISTER REALLY DIFFICULT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY IS THAT THREE PEOPLE WILL BE NOMINEE HAS THE CURRENT HE SHOOK AND HE CANNAE THEIR LEADER A FINICKY HE'LL MEET YOUR MARTIN WHO'S LEADER HAVE BEEN A FALL THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY AND THE PRESIDENT OF SINN FEIN GERRY ADAMS ALL THREE WILL BE NOMINATED HOWEVER THE EXPECTATION IS THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE ELECTED THAT INSTEAD
THE VOTE WILL BE A CASE OF PEOPLE SHOOTS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS RATHER THAN NEW GOVERNMENTS AND THE FINAL OUTCOME TODAY WILL PROBABLY BE THAT THE IRISH PARLIAMENT THE DOOR WITH A SIR JONES AND ENDA KENNY THE CURRENT T. SHIRT HE'LL REMAIN IN THAT WAS A KIND OF CARETAKER PRIME MINISTER AT LEAST FOR THE MEANTIME SO HOW ARE THE NEGOTIATIONS TO FORM A COALITION GOING ANY PROGRESS I THINK I WILL
ALL THE TALKING'S BEGUN GARDEN I THINK THAT'S AS FAR AS YOU CAN REALLY GO SARAH THE NUMBERS JUST DON'T MAKE IT EASY THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT SEATS IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT THE BIGGEST PARTY FOR NIKHIL AS A MENTOR THAT'S ANDY KENNY'S PARTY HAS FIFTY SEATS SO THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SEATS
THEREFORE THEY NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT TO FALL ANYTHING LIKE A STABLE GOVERNMENT KNIGHT HAS ALREADY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH INDEPENDENCE AND THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THOSE AS WELL OF SOME OF THE SMALLER PARTIES BUT ULTIMATELY THOSE NUMBERS THEY JUST DON'T MAKE SENSE SO FOR A STABLE GOVERNMENT MOST PEOPLE THINK THE ONLY REAL OPTION WOULD BE A COALITION BETWEEN FINN OR FALL AND BEEN A GALE NOW THOUGH THE TWO BIGGEST PARTIES BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF THAT FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A LONG RIVALRY THAT STRETCHES RIGHT BACK
HARRON CIVIL WAR SO THAT'S NINETY YEARS OF HISTORY AND SECONDLY THERE IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT WOULD BE THE PRICE FOR GOVERNMENT FIT OR FALL HAS A BIT OF A RESURGENCE IN THE LAST ELECTION THERE JUST SIX SEATS BEHIND FOR NIKHIL NAE SO THAT GIVES THEM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LEVERETT AND THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT
THEY WOULD WARM TO THE NEGOTIATION IS EQUAL IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A RETREATING T. SHUCKS HAVE BASICALLY THEY COULD TICK TONES HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER POTENTIALLY NOW THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN FINN OR FALL AND FEELING THEY ARE REALLY ONLY GETTING UNDERWAY NIGHT AND AS A RESULT
I MEAN THEIR OWN IDEAL FIN OR GILL IS IT COULD BE FORTY SIX WEEKS BEFORE ANYTHING THIS ONE A NIGHT FOR HIM THIS WAS SOME TIME YET CHRIS BACK LEFT THANKS VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE PAPERS MANY OF THEM EXAMINING THE GOVERNMENT'S DEFEAT OVER PLANS TO RELAX THE LAWS ON SUNDAY TRADING IN ENGLAND AND WALES ACCORDING TO THE SUN DAVID CAMERON AND THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WERE ENGAGED IN A FRANTIC ARM TWISTING EFFORT TO TRY TO SEE OFF THE REBELLION THE HEAD OF THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS SIMON WALKER TELLS THE PAPER THE VOTE
WAS THE WORK OF LUDDITES WHO BLOCKED PLANS TO AMEND WHAT HE CALLED THE OUTDATED RULES THE GUARDIAN ADDS THAT MINISTERS HAD OFFERED A WATER DOWN THE PLANS BY ROLLING THEM OUT AND ONLY TWELVE PILOT AREAS BUT THAT AMENDMENT WAS SUBMITTED TO LATE FOR CONSIDERATION THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THE DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS RELEASED FIGURES SHOWING THAT EXTENDED SUNDAY TRADING WOULD ADD ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS TO THE ECONOMY OVER THE NEXT DECADE THE MAIL EDITORIAL ACCUSES THE SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS WHO OPPOSE THE MEASURE OF CYNICALLY ABUSING OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM
AS OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW THAT SCOTLAND HAD A DEFICIT OF FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS LAST YEAR IT ASKED WHETHER THE S.N.P. SHOULD SHOW A LITTLE HUMILITY NOT TO MENTION GRATITUDE TO THEIR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOURS BUT THE DAILY MIRROR ARGUES THAT WHILE THE S.N.P. MAY BE GUILTY OF HYPOCRISY WHEN SCOTLAND'S LARGE STORES SET THEIR OWN OPENING TIMES FOR ONCE THEIR POLITICAL GAMES HAD PRODUCED A DECENT RESULT THE TIMES OFTEN AS EVIDENCE OF WHAT IT CALLS A MASSIVE LEAK OF TOP SECRET ISLAMIC STATE DOCUMENTS CONTAINING THE NAMES AND DETAILS OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
THE GROUP'S JIHADIST FIGHTERS AT LEAST A DOZEN BRITISH NATIONALS ARE SAID TO BE AMONG THE RECRUITS WHO FELL FOR MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES IT'S REPORTED THAT THE CASH WAS STOLEN BY A FORMER EXTREMIST IN FELT THAT I WAS NO LONGER FOLLOWING ISLAMIC RULES SENIOR BANKERS ARE SAID BY THE FINANCIAL TIMES TO HAVE WARNED OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AGAINST MAKING A FURTHER CUT INTEREST RATES AT TODAY'S POLICY MEETING
EXECUTIVES FROM U. B'S AND AUSTRIA'S ASKED BANK TELL THE PAPER THERE PUSHING RATES FURTHER INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY WOULD HARM THE ECONOMY HURT SABRES AND FORCE BANKS INTO IT MORE RISKY LENDING BRITAIN'S YEAR ZERO DECLARES THE NEWSPAPERS IT ALONG WITH ITS SISTER PUBLICATION INDEPENDENT LEADS WITH THE NEWS THAT RISING NUMBERS OF WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED ON ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS THE ISO UNIONS AND M.P.S HAVE ACCUSED EMPLOYERS EXPLOITING JOB INSECURITY TO FOR STAFF TO ACCEPT THE TERMS INDEPENDENT PREDICTS
THAT A MILLION PEOPLE COULD BE RELIANT ON ZERO HOURS JOBS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR TEENAGE PREGNANCIES HAVE HALVED ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH AND IT'S ALL DUE TO THE RISE AND SOCIAL MEDIA IF THERE'S ONE THEORY IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LESS TIME PHYSICALLY IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY BECAUSE OF THE LURE OF SITES SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND THE DAILY EXPRESS HAS A HEART WARMING TALE OF A PENGUIN THAT SWIMS FIVE THOUSAND MILES EACH YEAR TO SEE ITS BEST PAL THE ELDERLY BRAZILIAN MAN WHO SAVED ITS LIFE FIVE YEARS AGO THE BIRD WHOSE NAME IS DIM DIM
WAS FOUND ON ROCKS COVERED IN OIL BY A RETIRED FISHERMAN WHO CARED FOR IT BEFORE RELEASING IT BACK INTO THE SEA IN DIM STAYS FROM JUNE TO FEBRUARY WITH THE MAN ON AN ISLAND NEAR RADIATION AREA BEFORE HEADING BACK TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF ARGENTINA AND IS SAID TO BE MORE AFFECTION EVERY TIME THE PAIR ARENAS
IT'S NOW COMING UP TO A QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT A WATCHDOG IS PUTTING FORWARD PROPOSALS TO TACKLE HIGH ENERGY BILLS AND ENCOURAGE COMPETITION IN THE ENERGY MARKET THE GOVERNMENT WAS DEFEATED IN THE COMMONS LAST NIGHT OF HER PLANS TO RELAX SUNDAY TRADING LAWS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THAT WE ALREADY KNOW BUT WHAT OF THE DETAIL A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S JOINED LABOUR IN THE SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS TO THROW OUT THE MOVE A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN HAS THE DETAILS
STARTED WHEN THE M.P.S HE HAD COUNTED THE VOTES APPEARED ALL DAY
THE AYES TO THE RIGHT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THE NOSE THE LEFT TWO HUNDRED EIGHT
AN AD HOC COALITION OF CONSERVATIVE REBELS LABOUR AND THE S.N.P. HAD REJECTED PLANS TO GIVE COUNCILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES THE POWER TO ALLOW LARGE STORES TO OPEN FOR LONGER ON SUNDAYS AS M.P.S CROWDED INTO THE COMMONS CHAMBER OPPOSITION MEMBERS TAUNTED AND TEASE THE CHANCELLOR WHO WAS SITTING ON THE GOVERNMENT FRONT BENCH THE PLAN HAD FIRST BEEN ANNOUNCED IN GEORGE OSBORNE'S POST ELECTION BUDGET LAST JULY LABOUR'S SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY ANGELA EAGLE WAS SOON ON HER FEET
IS SPOKEN ON THIS VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF SUNDAY TRADING WHICH WOULD HAVE AFFECTED MILLIONS OF WORKERS CAN WE
THEY WILL ABANDON THEIR TAWDRY
I LOVE THIS HOUSE AND I MEAN IN THE CHANCEL
THAT WAS THE CUE FOR MORE OPPOSITION CHEERS AND JEERS IT HAD BEEN A LOT QUIETER AND THE LEADING CONSERVATIVE REBEL DAVID BURROWS HAD OPENED THE DEBATE HE SAID SHOP WORKERS AND FAITH GROUPS HAD CONTACTED HIM TO COMPLAIN THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO UNPICK A SETTLED ARRANGEMENT AND MISTER BURROWS ARGUED THAT M.P.S COULD CHOOSE WHAT TO DO ON A SUNDAY
WE HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE OF WINNING AT CHURCH NOT WITH A WEE SHOP OR NOT TO US TIME TO SPEND WITH FAMILIES
AND IT'S THOSE PEOPLE NEED TO BE A VOICE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT SAME CHOICE WHEN IT'S THE CARING RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT'S THROUGH WORK HE SENSIBILITIES AND WE NEED TO BE VERY
BEFORE WE ENSURE WE IMPOSE ON THE FURTHER WE GO SOLEMN BUT HIS FELLOW CONSERVATIVE ROBERT JEN RICK SAID M.P.S SHOULD TRUST THEIR CONSTITUENTS
WE ALL HAVE TO FIND OUR OWN VALENTE AND RIO CAPABLE OF DECIDING WHETHER WE WORK OR SHOP ON A SUNDAY
CONSTITUENTS WILL MAKE IN THEIR LIFE
AS THE DEBATE CONTINUED OVER THREE HOURS THE PRIME MINISTER HELD A SERIES OF PRIVATE MEETINGS WITH CONSERVATIVES TO TRY TO WIN THEM OVER THERE'D BEEN TALK OF A GOVERNMENT COMPROMISE HER PROMISE TO TRY OUT THE NEW RULES IN TWELVE AREAS TO SEE HOW EXTENDED OPENING HOURS AFFECTED LOCAL ECONOMIES AND WORKERS M.P.S DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO VOTE ON THAT PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE SPEAKER JOHN BERKO RULED MINISTERS HADN'T SUBMITTED THEIR AMENDMENT IN TIME
BUT THE COMMUNITIES MINISTER BRANDON LEWIS SAID IF M.P.S REJECTED THE REBEL PROPOSAL HE WOULD INTRODUCE THE PILOT PROPOSAL WHEN THE BILL RETURNED TO THE LORDS
WE WILL GATHER EVIDENCE ABOUT THE LIBERALISATION
INCLUDING THE USE OF ZONING AND ITS EFFECTS ON THOSE ECONOMY
AND OF COURSE THE IMPACT ON WORKERS WILL BE MEASURED TO THE D. U. P. IAN PAISLEY ACCUSED HIM OF TRYING TO SALVE THE CONSCIENCE OF THE HOUSE BY THE PROMISE OF A STAY OF EXECUTION BUT THERE'LL BE A REALLY NICE FUNERAL
THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS SUPPORTERS ARGUED GIVING MORE POWERS TO LOCAL COUNCILS WAS DEVOLUTION AND THAT EXTENDING OPENING HOURS WOULD CREATE MORE JOBS AND HELP HIGH STREETS THAT WERE STRUGGLING IN THE FACE OF COMPETITION FROM INTERNET SHOPPING
THE LABOUR M.P. DAVID LUMMY SAID RELAXING THE LAW WOULD DAMAGE FAMILY LIFE HE CITED THE EXAMPLES OF SPAIN PORTUGAL AND FRANCE WHERE HE SAID THERE WERE REAL RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY OPENING HOURS
IS IT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THIS GOVERNMENT THINKS THAT WE SHOULD PUT THE FREE MARKET ABOUT EVERY THING
CONSERVATIVE TO PROTECT THE FAMILY AND IT'S WORTH PROTECTING
LONGER OPENING HOURS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED IN SCOTLAND THE S. N. PEAS HAMMER BARDELL EXPLAINED WHY HER PARTY WAS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THE CHANGES
IT IS NOT A SINGLE CLAUSE IN THE SPELL OR ANY SENTENCE THAT ANY U.K. GOVERNMENT MINISTER HAS A TOAD AND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH A REASSURANCE THAT SCOTTISH WORKERS AND INDEED MY PRESENT SHOP WORKERS ACROSS THE U.K. WILL NOT LOSE OUT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PROTECTION FOR THE TRADITIONAL RATES OF PAY
LATER THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAINT JUDE JAVID SAID HE RESPECTED M.P.S WHO'D VOTED ON PRINCIPLE HOWEVER I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED BY THE CHILDISH AND HYPOCRITICAL ACTIONS OF THE S.N.P.
THE GOVERNMENT LOST BY THIRTY ONE VOTES LAST NIGHT MINISTERS MADE IT CLEAR THEY WOULDN'T TRY TO RELAX THE SUNDAY TRADING LAWS IN THE WAKE OF THE DEFEAT
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING AND THERE'LL BE MORE AS USUAL AT HALF PAST EIGHT FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON LONG WAY FROM DIGITAL RADIO ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW FIX THE ROADS IS THAT DEMAND WAS AN ANNUAL DEMAND ISN'T IT COMES WITH GREAT FEELING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE AYE AYE IN ADVANCE OF THE BUDGET NEXT WEEK AND EDMUND KING IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST THE GOVERNMENT SAY THEY ARE AND THEY'RE PROVIDED A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY TO DO IT
WELL THEY DID PROVIDE AN EXTRA TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS AN EMERGENCY FUND LAST YEAR BUT THAT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH IT'S PAPERING OVER THE CRACKS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY ESTIMATE THAT'S THOSE THE BACKLOG OF SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE BILLION POUNDS
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR DRIVERS SOME DRIVERS ARE PAYING TWENTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR JUST IN IN FUEL DUTY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THAT RING FENCE TO FIX THE POTHOLES BECAUSE WHAT A REPORT TODAY'S SHOWS IS THAT ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF DRIVERS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE HAVE THEY CAUSE DAMAGE TO EITHER TYRES WHEELS SUSPENSION BODYWORK
FROM ACTUALLY HITTING POTHOLES AND ACCIDENTS TERMINE THERE WAS AN AWFUL CASE IN SOUTH LONDON WEYBRIDGE AND SURREY JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AT A CYCLIST WHO DIED AFTER HIS BIKE HIT A POTHOLE AND IT'S A SERIOUS BUSINESS NO IT IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE
TWO WHEELS WHETHER THEY'D HIT A POTHOLE THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN OTHER CASES WHERE THEY'VE GONE TO AVOID A POTHOLE AND THEN COULDN'T COLLIDED WITH WITH THE VEHICLE SO IT IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS IT COST A LOT OF MONEY
WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING REPORTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AT TYRES AND ALL PATROLS THAT IT IS INCREASING IN FACT MY OWN CAR I'M ESTATE CAR A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HIT A POT HOLE WAS FILLING UP WITH FUEL HEARD A BIG
AND THE WHOLE FRONT SUSPENSION HAD GONE SO I'VE SUFFERED PERSONALLY SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAKE IT AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE BUDGET LET'S WHENEVER WE POLL MOTORISTS COMES BACK AS WE'RE COMING UP NEXT WEEK IT COMES UP AS AS A TOP THREE CONCERN OF DRIVERS THE STATE OF THE ROADS
SHE'S SPENDING AS MUCH ON FUEL DUTY AS LOCAL AUTHORITIES ACTUALLY GETTING COUNCIL TAX SURELY A PROPORTIONATE A GREATER PROPORTION THAT FUEL DUTY COULD BE SPENT FILLING UP THAT'S NOT THE WAY THINGS WORK THERE IS THEN WE DON'T HAVE HIGH PROPAGATED TAXES OR MOST CASES WE DON'T AND THAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT ARE ACTUALLY
TALKING THE FUTURE OF THE VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY ACTUALLY BEING HARD PUFFER COATED SO IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE TREASURY IS BREAKING THAT TREND AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR MONEY FULLY RING FENCED AND ENSURE THAT IT IS SPENT ON POTHOLES

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES PLANS TO TACKLE HIGH ENERGY BILLS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG INCLUDING TARIFF PRICE CAPS FOR VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE RELUCTANT CUSTOMERS TO SWITCH SUPPLIERS
DAVID CAMERON IS TO SET OUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE BENEFITS OF THE U.K. STAYING IN THE E.U. AND WOULD SAY THE ECONOMIC SHOCK OF LEAVING IS NOT A PRICE WORTH PAYING
AND THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RHINOS KILLED FOR THEIR HORNS IN AFRICA
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY ZEB ZONES THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG HAS JUST PUT FORWARD A SET OF PROPOSALS DESIGNED TO HELP HOUSEHOLDS OBTAINED BETTER VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY THEY PAY FOR ENERGY FOLLOWING A LENGTHY INVESTIGATION THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY WANTS TO INCREASE PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AND ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE SHOWN RELUCTANCE IN THE PAST TO CHANGE THEIR POWER SUPPLIER OUR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT JOHN MOYLAN REPORTS
THE C.M.A. SAYS THAT WHILE CUSTOMERS ON FIXED TARIFFS DO BENEFIT FROM COMPETITION AND ENERGY THERE'S ON STANDARD TARIFFS DON'T AND HOUSEHOLDS AND SMALL FIRMS HAVE PAID ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR MORE FOR THEIR ENERGY THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE DUE TO A LACK OF COMPETITION
TO REMEDY THAT THE SAME IS PROPOSING THAT OFF CHAIRMAN KEEPS A DATABASE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON STANDARD TARIFFS FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE RIVALS CAN THEN USE THAT TO DIRECTLY MARKET CUSTOMERS WITH BETTER DEALS
BUT THE SEAL MAY ALSO BELIEVE SOME CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T SWITCH NEED PROTECTING SO HE'S PROPOSING A TRANSITIONAL PRICE CONTROL FOR THE FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON PREPAYMENT METERS WHICH WILL RUN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE SMART METER RULE OUT COMPLETE
THESE ARE MAJOR INTERVENTIONS AND OUR ENERGY MARKET AND THE C.M.A. AS PROPOSING A HOST OF OTHER REMEDIES TO BUT THE BIG SUPPLIERS COULD PUSH BACK AGAINST PLANS TO RELEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS' DATA AND BY TARGETING THOSE ON PREPAYMENT METERS IT'S POSSIBLE MANY OTHER VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS WILL MISS OUT ON CHEAPER BILLS
DAVID CAMERON WILL TODAY ACCUSE THOSE WERE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE REGARDING THE LOSS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS AND BUSINESSES AS A PRICE WORTH PAYING IT WILL ALSO SET OUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE POSITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT BRITAIN WOULD GAIN FROM STAYING IN HIS REMARKS HAVE INCENSED LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED THEM AS UNWORTHY OF A PRIME MINISTER IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT HELENA GARNIER
IN MAKING THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED THAT LEAVING WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS GAMBLE AND PROFOUND ECONOMIC SHOCK IT'S RHETORIC HAS BEEN DUBBED PROJECT FEAR BY EUROSCEPTICS BUT TODAY DAVID CAMERON WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HAS PEOPLE MAKE UP THEIR MINDS THEY WANT FACTS AND ARGUMENTS LAID OUT IN A CALM AND RATIONAL WAY SO IN A SPEECH TO CAR WORKERS HE'S EXPECTED TO MAKE A MORE POSITIVE CASE AND SET OUT THE ADVANTAGES FOR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
HOWEVER DESPITE THE SLIGHT CHANGE IN EMPHASIS OF LANGUAGE HE WILL FIND TIME TO REMIND VOTERS OF HIS BELIEF THAT JOBS WILL BE LOST MORTGAGE RATES MIGHT RISE AND BUSINESSES WERE CLOSE IF BRITAIN PULLED OUT
BUT ONE OF MY CAMERON'S OWN CABINET MINISTERS CHRIS GRAYLING WHO'S CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE TODAY ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF UNDERMINING BRITAIN'S POSITION BY MAKING KEY ERRORS IN HIS Y. U. RENEGOTIATION MISTER GREYLING WILL WARN VOTERS THE Y. YOU WOULD HOOVER UP MORE MONEY AND MORE POWER AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN IN THE UNION
OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DISTINGUISH SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE U.K. IN A LETTER TO THE TIMES PROFESSOR STEPHEN HAWKING AND OTHER FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SAY MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. HAS INCREASED FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND HAS ALLOWED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN BRITAIN TO ATTRACT TALENTED SCIENTIST FROM THE REST OF EUROPE
N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS WARNED OF A MORE DIFFICULT TIME IN HOSPITALS AS THE LATEST STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS ENTERS ITS SECOND DAY IT'S SAID PLANS WERE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS ANY INCREASE IN PRESSURE ON SERVICES THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS APOLOGISED FOR THE DISRUPTION BUT SAID THE FORTY EIGHT HOUR WALKOUT WAS NECESSARY TO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON
SO FAR HOSPITAL SEEM TO BE COPING WELL WITH THE STRIKE BUT WITH HER SECOND DAY WITHOUT THE NORMAL NUMBERS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS THINGS ARE EXPECTED TO GET HARDER CONTINGENCY MEASURES HAVE SEEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OPERATIONS AND TREATMENTS CANCELLED BUT N.H.S. ENGLAND'S DOCTOR AND RAINS BREE IS CONCERNED THAT HOSPITALS MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS
THAT'S BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF JUNIOR DOCTORS TO CHASE TEST RESULTS AND GET PATIENT'S READY TO GO HOME SHE WARNED IT COULD CAUSE A BACKLOG ON HOSPITAL WARDS THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS SAID IT DEEPLY REGRETS THE DISRUPTION BUT THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO FORCE THROUGH CHANGES TO JUNIOR DOCTORS PAY AND CONDITIONS WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE UNFAIR AND UNSAFE
THIS LATEST WALK OUT IS THE THIRD IN THE DISPUTE BUT IT'S THE LONGEST SO FAR TWO MORE FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKES ARE PLANNED FOR APRIL
IRELAND'S NEW PARLIAMENT WILL MEET TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE COUNTRY'S INCONCLUSIVE GENERAL ELECTION MEMBERS OF THE DAWN WILL BE TRYING TO ELECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THEY'LL SUCCEED WITH NEGOTIATIONS TO FORM A COALITION GOVERNMENT NOT YET RESOLVED IS OUR IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CHRIS BUTLER
MEMBERS OF THE NEW IRISH PARLIAMENT THE DOLL WILL GATHER AND GOBLIN TODAY AND THE KEY VOTE WILL BE AN ATTEMPT TO ELECT SOMEONE TO THE POSITION OF T. SHUCK IRELAND'S PRIME MINISTER
IT'S THOUGHT THE CURRENT TEA SET AND THE KENNY THE LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY ME WHOLE MARTIN AND THE SINN FEIN PRESIDENT GERRY ADAMS WE'LL ALL BE NOMINATED BUT IT'S EXPECTED THAT NO ONE WILL SECURE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO TAKE THE POST
THE DIVIDED VOTE AT THE ELECTION HAS MADE COALITION NEGOTIATIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE BIGGEST PARTIES AND OLD RIVALS IN A GALE AND FINN A FALL IS SEEN BY MANY AS THE ONLY POSSIBILITY OF A STABLE GOVERNMENT BUT THERE IS SOME RESISTANCE BY POLITICIANS AND BOTH SIDES
IN THE MEANTIME IT'S THOUGHT ENDA KENNY WILL CONTINUE AS A CARETAKER PRIME MINISTER BUT THAT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL GOVERN IRELAND IN THE LONG TERM
IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY WHICH NOW DOMINATES PARLIAMENT HAS PUT FORWARD THE NAMES OF THE TWO MEN IT WANTS DENOMINATORS VICE PRESIDENTS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES AS A TRUSTED AIDE OF THE FORMER AND FORMER DRIVER OF THE PARTY LEADER UNSUNG SOO CHEE SHE CAN'T BE NOMINATED AS SHE REMAINS BARRED FROM THE PRESIDENCY BY THE MILITARY DRAFTED CONSTITUTION
JAPAN HAS PROTESTED TO NORTH CAREER OVER ITS LATEST LAUNCH OF A BALLISTIC MISSILES WHICH WERE FIRED INTO THE SEA THE PROTEST WAS LAUNCHED TO THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BEIJING STEVE EVANS REPORTS FROM THE SOUTH KOREAN CAPITAL SEOUL
THE LAUNCH OF THE MISSILES FOLLOWS A SIMILAR LAUNCHED LAST WEEK JUST AFTER THE UN TITAN SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA YESTERDAY KIM JONG ON THE COUNTRY'S LEADER SAID HIS MILITARY HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING A NUCLEAR BOMB SMALL ENOUGH TO PUT ON A MISSILE
THERE IS SOME SCEPTICISM BY OUTSIDE EXPERTS ABOUT SUCH CLAIMS BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT NORTH KOREA IS DEVELOPING BOTH NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE ROCKETS TO DELIVER THEM
PYONGYANG ZE DEMONSTRATIONS OF MILITARY POWER AND ITS THREADS TO WREAK NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION ON ITS ENEMIES ARE COMMON AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WHEN U.S. AND SOUTH KOREAN FORCES WHOLE JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WHICH PYONGYANG SAYS A PRACTICE FOR REMOVING ITS LEADERSHIP THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE THREATS ARE EMPTY
THE AYE AYE IS CALLING ON THE CHANCELLOR TO PROVIDE EXTRA MONEY TO MEND THE ROADS WHEN HE DELIVERS HIS BUDGET NEXT WEEK THE MOTORING ORGANISATION ESTIMATES ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF DRIVERS HAVE SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR CARS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AFTER HITTING POTHOLES
THE NUMBER OF RHINOS KILLED BY POACHERS IN AFRICA HAS INCREASED FOR THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW FIGURES COMPILED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE SHOW THAT MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED OF THE ANIMALS WERE POACHED FOR THEIR HORNS LAST YEAR ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THE LOSSES ARE ALARMING A SCIENCE EDITOR DAVID SHOOK WHEN REPORTS THE SCALE OF THIS SLAUGHTER HAS BECOME HORRIBLY FAMILIAR WITH DATA ONCE AGAIN SHOWING THAT ONE OF AFRICA'S MOST FAMOUS SPECIES FACES EVER GREATER THREAT TO ITS SURVIVAL
THE CAUSE IS UNCHANGING TO THE RHINOS' HORNS ARE PRIZED IN SOUTH EAST ASIA WHERE THEY FETCH EXTRAORDINARY PRICES ON THE BLACK MARKET
WHILE A FEW COUNTRIES NOTABLY SOUTH AFRICA HAVE MANAGED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF RHINOS KILLED OTHERS ARE SEEING A SUDDEN SPIKE IN DEATH
CONSERVATION EXPERTS SAY THAT ONLY WITH VIGOROUS PATROLLING AND CAREFUL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING WILL THE POACHERS BE DEFEATED
AND THAT A MASSIVE INCREASE IN POLITICAL WILMAN FINANCIAL BACKING HE NEEDED
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES IF THE CURRENT RATE OF LOSSES CONTINUES THEN WITHIN A DECADE THE ONLY RHINOS LEFT WILL BE IN SOME FORM OF CAPTIVITY
DAVID SHIPMAN REPORTING THAT I'M NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TWO YEARS AN INVESTIGATION IF FOR ENERGY PRICE ENERGY PRICES AND THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY HAVE JUST PUBLISHED THEIR RESULTS AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THINGS DESIGNED TO STOP PEOPLE BEING RIPPED OFF BY ENERGY COMPANIES SIMON JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR IS HERE AND THEIR MAIN THOUGHTS OF WHAT WELL AS YOU SAY THIS IS THE THE MOST RADICAL ATTEMPT YET TO SOLVE THE STUBBORN
PROBLEM OF PERCEIVED HIGH ENERGY BILLS WHICH REACHED FEVER PITCH WHEN I REMEMBER WHEN ED MILIBAND SAID HE WANTED TO FREEZE ENERGY BILLS OR POTENTIALLY BREAK UP THE BIG PLAYERS
THEIR FINDINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS YOU NEED TO BREAK THE INERTIA THAT WE AS CUSTOMERS SUFFER FROM SEVENTY PERCENT OF US ARE STILL ON STANDARD VARIABLE TARIFFS IF YOU JUST SWITCHED YOU COULD SAY THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MOST OF US JUST DON'T SO HOW BEGIN TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON YOUR SUPPLIER STANDARD TARIFF FOR THREE YEARS
YOU ARE THEY'LL RELEASE YOUR DETAILS TO THE COMPETITORS AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PITCH FOR YOUR BUSINESS SO BASICALLY IF YOU DON'T SWITCH YOU'LL BE PROBABLY SORRY YOU DIDN'T COS YOU'LL BE BOMBARDED BY MARKETING INFORMATION FROM THE OTHER PLAYERS ALSO SOME PEOPLE FIND IT HARD TO SWITCH THOSE OF PEOPLE ON
PRE PAYMENT METERS WHO ARE IN DEBT TO THEIR SUPPLIER THAT GOING TO BE PRICE CAPS FOR THOSE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO REMOVE THE FORT TARIFFS RULE YOU MAY REMEMBER THE OFF GEM BROUGHT IN THAT ROLE TO TRY MAKING SIMPLER SO WE CAN COMPARE THINGS EASIER OR EASILY THEY SAY THAT STIFLES INNOVATIONS OR REMOVE THAT AND ONE ONE THING WHICH I THINK IS A MASSIVE CAN OF POLITICAL WORMS
IS THAT THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR LOW TOP CARBON TECHNOLOGIES THE GREEN STUFF ON YOUR BILL YOU MAY REMEMBER THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WHETHER THAT MAKES SENSE AHEAD OF TIME SO AS I SAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MASSIVE POLITICAL WRANGLE A REAL CAN OF WORMS
REMEMBER I SPOKE TO SOME OF THE BIG PLAYERS THEY SAY LOOK WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH IT WE'VE GOT TO I THINK HE WAS A CHALLENGING ENQUIRY BUT OTHERS SAY THEY'VE GOT A THOUSAND THOUSAND PAGES OF REPORT TO GET THROUGH AND THEY HAVEN'T RESPONDED YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIMON LET US TURN TO JULIET DAVENPORT IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF GOOD ENERGY ONCE MORE ENERGY FIRMS BUT THE SUPPLIER AND A PRODUCER OF ENERGY AND SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WANTED TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE SAINT
SO I THINK THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TWO YEARS WE'D HOPED IT WOULD BE QUICKER TO BE HONEST COS OBVIOUSLY THESE CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN PAYING OVER THE ODDS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AS WELL AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONE UP DURING THAT TIME BUT THE C.M.A. HAVE OBVIOUSLY SEEN THAT THIS IS QUITE COMPLEX AREA AND I THINK THE FIRST ROOMS THEY WERE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT WITH HER OR THEIR PRICE FITS AS OBVIOUSLY PUSHED BACK SO THEY COME BACK THESE NEW REMEDIES
WE THINK A GENERAL THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF IN HERE BUT IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED A DATABASE OF EVERYONE SHARED IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S PROBLEMS WITH THAT YES I THINK AND ALSO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAUSE CONSUMER IS THE CENTRE OF THIS SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MARKETED TO BUY LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT MARKET COMING THROUGH YOUR DOOR YOU NEED A REALLY GOOD OPT OUT CLAUSE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A SECURITY MAYBE AN OPT IN CLAWS I UPPED IN YES BECAUSE THAT WOULD REALLY PROTECT PEOPLE YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE A POSITIVE DECISION
THAT YOU WOULD BE CONTACTED AND I'M NOT SURE IT HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED ALL OF THIS BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT IS PART OF THE PLAN AT THE MOMENT NO AND I THINK THIS HAS STILL GOT TO BE WORKED THROUGH AND REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH AS WELL AND I THINK WE NEED TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES ABOUT HOW DO THEY WANT TO BE CONTACT THE DATABASES ARE THUMB ALMOST UP BUT YOU DO YOU THINK THEY NEED THEY NEED TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE TO IT CAN'T JUST BE A DATABASE OF PEOPLE THIS WAS PASSED AROUND THE INDUSTRY ARE YOU THAT YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THEN STONE AGE ANYONE BEING TERRIBLY KEEN ON THAT
WHAT ABOUT THE PRE PAID METERS IDEA THAT YOU ACTUALLY INTERVENE AND CAP THE PRICE THAT YOU CAN BE CHARGED ON A PRE PAID ME SO WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IF THIS IF THIS ACTUALLY PROTECTS VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS THAT'S REALLY GOOD THING AND I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR SMART METERING TO COME THROUGH TO START TO ACTUALLY SEE SOMEBODY'S DONE ALL CUSTOMERS PROTECTED IN WHAT IS SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE TARIFFS IN THE MARKET PLACE
I ONLY ADDITIONAL KITE WAS THAT IS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PRE PREPAYMENT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN EARLIER INVESTIGATION INTO TRY AND BRINGING THAT COST DOWN THERE FOR SMART METER MIGHT LOOK AT SOME OTHER IDEAS THAT THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY HERE BUT BUT HAVE BEEN AROUND HAVEN'T DAVID CAMERON YEARS AGO IT WAS WAS TALKING SAID IN THE COMMONS THAT HE HE HE WANTED THE COMPANIES SIMPLY TO PUT PEOPLE ON THE LOWEST POSSIBLE TARIFF AT ALL TIMES
THAT'S NUMBER ONE I THINK ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ON THAT IS THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT THE INFORMATION THAT INFORMATION IS NOT TRANSPARENT AND ALSO A LOT OF THESE TARIFFS ARE CHANGING CONSTANTLY SO THIS IS THE INFORMATION FROM WITHIN A COMPANY OR BACK AWAY THEY PRICE YES SO IF YOU DO YOU WANT TO SO I JUST OMETER COS WE GOT SLIGHTLY LIMITED TIMES APOLOGY APOLOGISE FOR INTERRUPTING BUT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT TO DO YOU FROM WHAT YOU'VE SEEN OF WHAT THE
C. AND A. ARE SUGGESTING DO YOU SEE ANY REAL EFFORT TO BRING GREATER TRANSPARENCY
NOT AT THE MOMENT WE'D WE'D LIKE TO SEE BETTER TRANSPARENCY SO IF YOU THAT'S QUITE A HOLE ISN'T IT AFTER TWO YEARS AND INVEST WELL IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT WAS THAT SEE THE BEE INFORMATION PART ANNETTE THERE MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO THAT THROUGH THE PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE BUT WE THINK THERE'S STILL MORE THEY COULD DO ANOTHER IDEA THAT HAS BEEN AROUND AS OFGEM ITSELF THE REGULATOR SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN PRICE COMPARISON SITE SO YOU'D ABSOLUTELY TRUST YOU GO THERE AND IT'S REAL INFORMATION AND NOBODY'S TRYING TO TO GET YOU TO CHANGE AND MAKE A BIT OF MONEY OUT OF IT THEMSELVES
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE COMING OUT I DEFINITELY THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY AND SEE WHETHER THAT IS SOMETHING BECAUSE AGAIN AS HE SAID TRUST IS ABSOLUTELY KEY HERE AND IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SWITCH THEY NEED TO TRUSS AT THE SWITCHING ON PROPER INFANT JUST A VERY BRIEF ONE ON THE WIDER PICTURE BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT EVERYONE SAYS THEY WANT TO DO IS ENCOURAGE MORE SMALLER FIRMS LIKE YOURSELVES TO GET
TO GET INVOLVED AND YET THERE ARE REASONS WHY IT'S DIFFICULT ISN'T IT I MEAN ONE OF THE MOTHERS IN THE BIG FIRMS CAN BORROW MONEY MORE EASILY CAN HIM INVEST MORRISON HAD SHOULD THAT ALSO BE ADDRESSED OR WE DID ASK FOR THIS TO BE ADDRESSED AND WE STILL THINK THAT THIS IS SOME AREA THAT CONTINUE ITS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THIS MARKET WORKS IN THE WAY IT FAVOURS THE INCOME BUT SUPPLIES WHO ESSENTIALLY WERE GIVEN THEIR CUSTOMER BASES WHEN THE MARKET WAS LIBERALISED SHOULD BE RE OPENED AND WE LOOKED AND AGAIN THAT'S NOT PART OF THIS NO
JULIE DAVENPORT FROM A GOOD ENERGY THANK YOU THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS WATCHDOG OVER THE SUN NEWSPAPER'S ARTICLE YESTERDAY
CLAIMING THAT THE QUEEN BACKED BY EXIT AND WANTED THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S HEADLINE WAS QUEEN BACK SOME BRECK'S IT THE TELEGRAPH LEAD STORY TODAY IS THAT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE IS FACING QUESTIONS EVER WHETHER HE IS THE SOURCE OF THAT STORY WE'RE JOINED IN A RADIO CAR BY THE EDITOR OF THE SUN TONY GALLAGHER GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING ARE YOU GUILTY OF OVER WRITING YOUR HEADLINE
ABSOLUTELY NOT MULTIPLE SOURCES TO SOURCES TO BE PRECISE CAME TO US WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUEEN AND HER VIEWS ON THE E.U. AND WE WOULD'VE BEEN DERELICT AND WHO IF WE DIDN'T PUT THEM IN THE PAPER IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT THE FACT THAT THE STORY'S INCONVENIENT FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE
IS NOT MY FAULT WE SERVE OUR READERS AND NOT BE ELITES WHO MIGHT BE UPSET AT WHAT WE'VE WRITTEN OH KAY BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE STORY IS IF YOU READ WHAT THE SUN WROTE IN THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE BASIS OF THE STORY YESTERDAY IT SEEMS TO BE ON REPORTS
THAT THE QUEEN SAID TO NICK CLEGG FIVE YEARS AGO THE E.U. WAS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND THE REASON I ASK YOU IF YOU'VE OVERWRITTEN YOUR HEADLINE IS THAT THE COMPLAINT FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE APPEARS TO BE UNDER CLAUSE ONE OF THE EDITORS' CODE OF PRACTICE WHICH SPECIFICALLY REFERS TO INCLUDING HEADLINES NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT HE WAS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IT'S QUITE ANOTHER TO SAY FIVE YEARS LATER SHE SUPPORTING A VOTE OUT OF THE E.U.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT THAT THE QUEEN'S VIEWS WERE EXPRESSED EXACTLY AS WE'D OUTLINED THEM IN BOTH THE HEADLINE AND THEIR STORY AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT WE KNEW MUCH MORE THAN WE PUBLISHED AND THAT REMAINS THE CASE IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE'S NOT JUST ONE OCCASION WHEN THESE VIEWS WERE WERE AIRED AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE SPENT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME FOCUSING ON A ON A LUNCH WITH NICK CLEGG BUT THERE WAS A SECOND OCCASION
WHERE SHE EXPRESSED SIMILARLY SCATHING VIEWS ABOUT THE E.U. AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE SO WE DIDN'T PUT THIS IN THE PAPER WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE THERE WERE MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR WHAT WE HAD TO DO AND WE'RE IN NO DOUBT THAT THE STORY'S ACCURATE O.K. SO BECAUSE THE STORY THAT YOU HAVE THAT FROM THE LUNCH WITH PRIVY COUNCILLORS WAS BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW THAT THERE WAS A REFERENDUM ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT SINCE THEN SHE HAS STATED TO PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TWO SAUCES WITH THIS THAT SHE WANTS THE U.K. OUT OF THE
I'M SAYING THAT THERE WERE TWO OCCASIONS AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THE PRECISE DETAILS ON THE SECOND OCCASION BECAUSE ALL IT WILL DO IS SET OFF A RATHER ABSURD MOLE HUNT IN THE FASHION OF TODAY'S NEWSPAPERS WHICH ARE SEEKING TO NATE NAME MICHAEL GO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY UNFAIR TO THEIR BUT ON THE TIME LIKE THIS THIS IS THE CRITICAL THING IS WHETHER SHE KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REFERENDUM OR NOT
I THINK THAT'S SEMANTICS WITH RESPECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE EUROZONE WAS IN THE MIDST OF A HUGE CRISIS AND IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY UNSURPRISING IF HER MAJESTY HAD VIEWS ON THE MATTER AND FELT THAT BRITAIN'S DESTINY WAS SERVED OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION INDEED
DAILY TELEGRAPH TODAY STORY ISN'T A CRISIS THE STORY MARKEDLY DIFFERENT IF IT BECOMES FAR MORE RECENT THAT SHE'S MADE COMMENTS ABOUT HER VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. THAT IS ENTIRELY DIM THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO HAD CERTAIN WHO WERE DISPARAGING ABOUT THE E.U. FIVE YEARS AGO WHO NOW ARE SUPPORTING A VOTE FOR THE U.K. TO STAY IN THE
I THINK THAT'S SEMANTICS WE DIDN'T HIDE THE FACT THAT THE LUNCH WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THE STORY STANDS AND IS ACCURATE AND I'M CONFIDENT THE STORY'S COMPLETELY RIGHT
ON THE QUESTION OF MICHAEL GAVE OF COURSE THAT LUNCH THEY WERE ONLY VERY FEW PEOPLE THERE ONE OF WHOM WAS MICHAEL WHICH IS POSSIBLY WHY THE TELEGRAPH TODAY HE'S LEADING ON A STORY THAT HE MAY BE THE SOURCE OF THIS STORY
YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT ME FOR A SINGLE MOMENT TO REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT THE SOURCING OF THE STORY IN THE SUN THOSE OF A CYNICAL MIND WOULD THINK THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL GOES OUT OF THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND THE FACT THAT NICK CLEGG AND WEST STR EATING HAVE BEEN ON THEIR HIND LEGS COMPLAINING ABOUT IT WAS A PRINCELY WOULD RATHER POINT IN THAT DIRECTION BUT YOU CERTAINLY WOULDN'T EXPECT ME TO
DO ANYTHING THAT WILL IDENTIFY OUR SOURCES WHATSOEVER THIS COMES VERY SOON OF COURSE AFTER STORY ABOUT PRINCE WILLIAM BEING WORK SHY AND SHIRKING HIS DUTIES AS A PILOT AND IS IT A DELIBERATE CHANGE OF TONE TOWARDS THE ROYALS FROM THE SUN NEWSPAPER
WE ARE JUDGING STORIES ON THEIR MERIT AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SUN NEWSPAPER THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT WE SEE PRINCE WILLIAM IS BEING WORK SHY I THINK MOST OF THE NATIONAL PRESS HAVE POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A VERY TAXING FULL TIME JOB IN IN NORFOLK AND DOES VERY VERY FEW ROYAL DRUNK YOUR DUTIES AS IT'S A MATTER OF RECORD AND IT'S A STORY THAT THE STORIES AND COVERED IN MULTIPLE MEDIA SOURCES THE IDEA THAT IT'S IT'S JUST THE SUN THAT MIGHT BE BEHIND THIS IS RIDICULOUS TEDDY GALLAGHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH

MATTHEW THANKS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE IS A REVOLUTION THAT IS GOING TO START AT HOBAN UNDERGROUND STATION IN CENTRAL LONDON COULD THEN COME TO AN ESCALATOR NEAR UINE A STATION IN A SHOP NO WALKING IS THE REVOLUTION EVERYONE STANDS SOME NARROW ESCALATORS THAT'S ALREADY THE CASE BUT SHOULD IT BE THE RULE NICK BROWN IS HERE FROM LONDON UNDERGROUND AND PROFESSOR ED AS WELL NOT ONLY FROM A VAN ROUND THE BOTTOM LONDON UNDERGROUND MONT LIKED YOU BUT WE HAD TO TELL US ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AT HOME
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FOLLOWING UP A TRIAL WE DID LAST YEAR WHERE WE ARE SEEKING TO MOVE MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THE STATION QUICKER OPENS ONE OF OUR BUSIEST STATIONS OVER FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE USE IT A YEAR AND INSTEAD OF HAVING SOME OF THE CROWDING AT THE FOOT OF THE ESCALATOR BY HAVING PEOPLE STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND MOVING UP THE ESCALATOR SEQUENTIALLY SUPPORTED AND ASSISTED BY OUR STAFF WILL MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH THE STATION QUICKER SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT THE TESTS WE DID LAST YEAR PROVE THE POINT
AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S LOW COST AND IT'S IN ADDITION TO OBVIOUSLY TO THE HUGE INVESTMENT PROGRAMME WE HAVE TO EXPAND OUR STATIONS AND THE SCIENCE ON THIS STANDS UP DOES IT PROFESSOR KELLY YES IT DOES WE SUGGESTED DOING SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BASED ON THEIR STUDIES OF OUR COMPUTER SIMULATIONS WHICH WE SUPPORTED BY GOING TO LONDON GOING TO MAKING MEASUREMENTS ON ON ON HOW PEOPLE USE ESCALATORS
BUT BUT IF YOU HAVE THE PART OF AN ESCALATOR AND YOU WALK UP THE WAY IS CLEAR YOU WILL GET UP MORE QUICKLY THAN IF YOU DON'T AND THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WENT THERE WHO LIKE TO WALK UP THE ESCALATORS HOO HOO GET UP SLOWER ISN'T ISN'T THAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DISADVANTAGED THE PEOPLE WHO WALK UP WHO CHOOSE TO WALK UP THE ESCALATOR WHEN YOU HAVE A FREE LINE BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT QUICKER IN FACT ACCORDING TO OUR SIMULATIONS FOR ONE ESCALATOR A LINE AND FOR ONE TRAIN LOAD OF PEOPLE OF FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE TRYING TO USE AN ESCALATOR WE CALCULATE YOU SAVE ONE PERSON DAY
OF OF WASTED TIME BUT YOU ARE YOU ARE SPEEDING UP THE SLOWCOACH ISN'T IT BROWN AND YOU ARE GET YOUR DO YOU ACCEPT THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO'D LIKE TO LEAP UP THE ESCALATOR HAVEN WON'T BE ABLE TO WHEN WE DID THE TRIAL HAD A FEW LETTERS FROM PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO ZIP UP THE ESCALATOR AS YOU SAY BUT FOR THE GREATER GOOD THIS WILL MOVE MORE PEOPLE IN A PERIOD OF TIME YOU ALMOST THIRTY PER CENT IMPROVEMENT OF FLOW IN ONE OF THE HIGHEST ESCALATORS WE HAVE A LONDON UNDERGROUND AND FOR THE MAJORITY OF PASSENGERS THIS WILL REPRESENT AN IMPROVEMENT AT HOBAN
AND IT'S JUST WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY ABOUT WHEN TO DO IT WHAT SIGNS ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IS GOING TO ALL THE TIME OR JUST WHEN IT'S CROWDED WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING THIS TRIAL THROUGHOUT NOT ACROSS EVERY ESCALATOR SO PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ON ONE OF THE ESCALATORS TO WALKER BUT OBVIOUSLY AROUND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE BE WATCHING WITH INTEREST WELL OUR ESCALATORS DO GO A LITTLE QUICKER THAN IN MANY SHOPPING CENTRES SO WE'RE GOOD AT MOVING PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE OUR STAFF WILL BE ON HAND THEY RUN THE TRIAL LAST YEAR AND A LOT OF THEIR COMMENTS A LOT OF THE COMMENTS OF THE PASSENGERS HAVE GONE INTO THE SILAGE
SOME OF THE MORE OVERT AND SOME OF THE MORE SUBTLE CLUES THAT WILL HELP THIS THIS LONGER TRIAL I'M PURE PROVE A GREAT SUCCESS AS WELL YOU HAVE CONDUCTED VERY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON HUMAN MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR ON ESCALATORS AND ACTUALLY NOT JUST IN BRITAIN ONLY RIGHT RIGHT AROUND THE WELL IS THERE A KIND OF OTHER CULTURAL DIFFERENCES HAVE IT IS IT SOMETHING WE'VE JUST GOT TO GET
USED TO CHANGING OUR MINDS ON THE RUN HE'S NODDING IS THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE ALL SORTS OF CULTURAL INFLUENCES THAT DICTATE HOW WE USE ESCALATORS AND PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WILL STAND ON DIFFERENT SIDES AND THERE'LL BE A DIFFERENT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE USING ESCALATORS BUT A REALLY INTERESTING OBSERVATION WE MADE THE FIRST ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES WE DID WAS IN SHANGHAI AND CHINA AND WHAT WE FOUND THERE ON REALLY BUSY ESCALATORS
THERE WAS NO ERICA AND EVERYONE WROTE THE ESCALATOR AND WE ORIGINALLY WHEN WE SAW THIS BECKHAM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE PUT THIS DOWN TO A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE BUT AFTER WE DID THE ANALYSIS WE REALISED THIS WAS THE WISDOM OF THE CROWD THEY JUST GET MAD THEY FIGURED IT OUT THERE IF THAT IF EVERYONE WROTE THE ESCALATOR
YOU GET MORE PEOPLE THROUGH LESS CONGESTION LESS TIME ICED THAT YEAH SO BRIEF IT BRAND IS THIS GOING TO TAKE OFF AROUND THE COUNTRY WE WILL TREAT ESCALATORS DIFFERENT WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO TRY IT IN LONDON UNDERGROUND AS WE SAID AT HOME AND WE'RE DOING IT ON ONE OF THE HIGHEST ESCALATORS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT ACROSS BUT WE WANT TO GET MORE DATA AND AS WE SAY PERHAPS THIS WILL BE A NEW CULTURAL NORM FOR PARTS OF THE UNDERGROUND AT A VERY BUSY NICK BROWN MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LONDON UNDERGROUND PROFESSOR ED GALEA AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY'S BACK WITH A SKANK SERRA JUSTIN GOOD MORNING IT'S IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR CHELSEA IN THE OPEN PROBABLY FOR QUITE SOME TIME AS THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE LAST NIGHT BY PARIS HUNCH A MAN WHO WON TWO ONE AT STAMFORD BRIDGE IT'S BEEN UP A TROUBLED ALL SEASON FOR CHELSEA THEY SITE MANAGER JOE SAY MARINE HERE AND THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING IN THE LOWER HALF OF THE TABLE SO CARETAKER MANAGER GUS HEADING HAD THIS TO SAY AFTER LAST NIGHT'S MATCH CHELSEA IS NOW IN IN A TRANSITION PERIOD
THEY HAVE TO WORK TO SEE HOW TO GO ON AND TRY TO REGAIN THE LASTS AND LASTS A TERRAIN WHERE AT CHELSEA USED THERE'LL BE LESS THAT'S TRUE IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET INTO FOURTH POSITION BUT YEAH WE KNEW
OUR FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY WAS AT THE MATCH JOHN GOOD MORNING MORNING A TIME OF TRANSITION WHERE WHY A CHELSEA IN THIS SITUATION HAVING WON THE LEAGUE LAST SEASON YES TRANSITION IS VERY MUCH THE WORD AND ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SAW THIS COMING A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO WINNING TWO TROPHIES LAST SEASON BUT OF COURSE WE HAD THE INTERNAL STRIFE THE THE PALPABLE DISCORD TO USE CHELSEA'S OWN TERM OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON AND A MARINE AND WHERE WE HAVE SEEN A RECOVERY OF OF SORTS UNDERGOES HEADING
THE EGGS ARE NOW ALL IN THE F.A. CUP BASKET AND CHELSEA GO TO EVERTON ON SATURDAY REALLY TESTING QUARTERFINAL TIE AS YOU SAY THEY MIGHT MISS OUT ON EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ALTOGETHER WHICH WOULD MAKE IT BY A DISTANCE THE MOST DISAPPOINTING SEASON FOR CHELSEA SINCE ROMAN ABRAMOVICH TOOK OVER THIRTEEN YEARS AGO AND THE NEW MANAGER WILL ARRIVE FOR THE START OF NEXT SEASON WHEN NEW MANAGERS ARRIVED THEY NORMALLY SAY IT WILL TAKE ME TWO OR THREE SEASONS UP TO GET THINGS GOING
CHELSEA COULD ALMOST FIT TWO OR THREE MANAGERS IN TWO TWO TWO OR THREE SEASONS IT APPEARS THAT ANTONIO CONTE WHO IS CURRENTLY THE COACH OF THE ITALIAN NATIONAL TEAM IS THE MAN WHO'S BEING LINED UP AND I THINK THAT IN ITSELF REPRESENTS SOMETHING OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEVOTE ALL OF HIS ATTENTIONS UNTIL AFTER ITALY'S INTEREST IN EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN COMES TO AN END SO
I THINK IT NEEDS SOMEONE WHO CAN COME IN AND STAMP HIS MARK AND HIS PERSONALITY ON THE JOB VERY QUICKLY I THINK JOHN TERRY'S LIKELY DEPARTURE MEANS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE OF ON FIELD LEADERSHIP STRONG LEADERSHIP I THINK THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND ALSO THERE IS A DESIRE FROM WITHIN TO PROMOTE THE YOUNG TALENT THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR ACADEMY
IF IT IS CONTI HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BULGING IN TRAY I WOULD DESCRIBE IT A QUICK FINAL THOUGHT ON ONE INCIDENT FROM LAST NIGHT'S MATCH WHEN THE WHISTLE WENT AT HALF TIME ADAM HAZARD SWAP SHIRTS WITH PASTRIES DE MARIA SOME CHELSEA FANS BOOT THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT AT HALF TIME
IT'S PART OF THE MODERN GAME SHIRT SWAPPING AT HALF TIME BECAUSE HE TINK SAID AFTERWARDS THAT IT IS MORE ACCEPTABLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD I THINK IS THE WAY THAT HE PHRASED IT HOWEVER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
IT IS WIDELY VIEWED AS BEING UNACCEPTABLE I THINK I THINK IT'S I THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE
OPEN TO IT SAY THAN THEY ONCE WERE BUT IT STILL HUGELY GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN I THINK FOR HAZARD HIMSELF WHO ALMOST IT IS A BAROMETER OF CHELSEA'S DECLINED THE FACT THAT A YEAR AGO HE ATE THE ABSOLUTE WORLD AT HIS FEET HE WAS THE STAR
AND THEN TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT INCIDENT LAST NIGHT DOESN'T REFLECT WELL ON HIM OR CHELSEA JOHN MURRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE SCOTTISH PREMIER LEAGUE SAINT JOHNSTONE BE INVERNESS ONE MIL ENGLAND'S WOMAN DREW NIL NIL FRANCE IN THE FINAL MATCH OF THEIR TOURNAMENT IN AMERICA AND TELL US HOW THE WATSONS GOOD FORM CONTINUES THREE DAYS AFTER THE MONTEREY EVENT WINNING IT SHE'S THROUGH TO THE SECOND ROUND OF THE INDIAN WELLS TOURNAMENT LIVERPOOL MAN UNITED IS THE BIG MATCH TONIGHT WE'LL HAVE LOTS ON THAT AT EIGHT TWENTY FIVE

THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG HAS PUBLISHED RECOMMENDATIONS DESIGNED TO HELP ENERGY COMPANIES GET BETTER ENERGY CUSTOMERS GET BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY THOSE WHO'VE NEVER CHANGE THEIR SUPPLY ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT THE MOST A SAFEGUARD TARIFF TO PROTECT VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS COULD LEAD TO LOWER BILLS FOR THE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE USING PREPAYMENT METERS
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL USE A SPEECH TO CAR MANUFACTURERS TODAY TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK BRITAIN BENEFITS FROM BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT HE WILL ALSO ACCUSED THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE REGARDING THE LOSS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS AND BUSINESSES AS A PRICE WORTH PAYING MEANWHILE ONE OF HIS SENIOR CABINET MINISTERS CHRIS GRAYLING WHO WANTS THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. WILL SAY MISTER CAMERON HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY REFORMS THAT BRITAIN NEEDS
PROFESSOR STEPHEN HAWKING IS AMONG MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SCIENTISTS WHO ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE U.K. REMAINING IN THE E.U. IN A LETTER TO THE TIMES THEY SAY LEAVING WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR U.K. SCIENCE
N.H.S. BOSSES IN ENGLAND SAY THEY'RE WORRIED THE SECOND DAY OF THE STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS COULD LEAD TO A BACKLOG OF PATIENTS IN HOSPITAL THEY BELIEVE THE LACK OF DOCTORS ON WARDS WILL DELAY SOME PEOPLE BEING DISCHARGED THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAYS THE WALKOUT IS NECESSARY TO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT
THE IRISH PARLIAMENT WILL TRY TO ELECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER TODAY ALTHOUGH IT'S EXPECTED TO FAIL BECAUSE NONE OF THE PARTIES AS ANYTHING CLOSE TO AN OVERALL MAJORITY IS THE FIRST PARLIAMENTARY SESSION SINCE THE GENERAL ELECTION HELD LAST MONTH
THE N.R.A. STARTING THE PROCESS OF SELECTING A NEW PRESIDENT THE NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY WHICH DOMINATES THE COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT HAS PUT FORWARD THE NAME OF ONE OF UNSUNG SUE CHEESE TRUSTED AIDES
JAPAN HAS PROTESTED TO NORTH CAREER OVER ITS LATERS LAUNCH OF BALLISTIC MISSILES WHICH WERE FIRED OFF ITS EAST COAST INTO THE SEA THE TWO ROCKETS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE TRAVELLED FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILES IT WAS A SIMILAR LAUNCHED LAST WEEK AFTER THE U.N. TITAN SANCTIONS ON PYONGYANG
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOT ONLY DID DAVID CAMERON NOT TO GET ENOUGH POWERS BACK FROM BRUSSELS IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS LAST MONTH HE MAY EVEN HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING WILL SAY IN A SPEECH TODAY HE'S CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HIS WERE HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING HELLO THERE
IN WHAT WAY DID THE PRIME MINISTER MAKE THINGS WORSE WITH HIS NEGOTIATION I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING SO FIRST PROMISE TO PUT A HERCULEAN EFFORT INTO TRYING TO SECURE CHANGE I SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE THE CHANGE THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US THAT THE WILLINGNESS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO CHANGE WAS THERE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE GOT IS BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS SAID RIGHT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE MOVE TOWARDS MUCH GREATER INTEGRATION
BRITAIN CANNOT STAND IN OUR WAY ACTUALLY THE TERMS OF THE DEAL COULD PUT US IN A POSITION WHERE CHANGES THAT MIGHT AFFECT US AYE THINGS WE'VE AGREED NOT TO TRY AND STOP AS WE WILL BE ENORMOUSLY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS IT THIS IS NOT A STATIC SITUATION I THINK WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP TOO MUCH CONTROL RIGHT NELL TO EUROPEAN UNION TO GOVERN OUR AFFAIRS BUT IN FUTURE AS THEY MOVED INTEGRATE FURTHER THE DANGER IS WE WILL SIMPLY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP THEM DOING THINGS THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON US ANYWAY O.K. BUT WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER DID SECURE WAS THAT
WRITTEN INTO FUTURE TREATIES WAS THE WORDS EVER CLOSER UNION DO NOT APPLY TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND HE SAID VERY CLEARLY AND WE KNOW THAT THINGS LIKE THE EUROZONE WE'RE NOT ANY PART OF YOU AS I WILL KNOCK GOING PART OF THE SHOWING AN AREA BUT IF YOU TAKE THE AREA FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE AS THE EUROZONE MOVES TOWARDS BEING MUCH MORE INTEGRATED DOING THINGS MUCH MORE HONEST AS A SINGLE GOVERNMENT THE DECISIONS THEY TAKE WILL NONETHELESS IMPACT ON THE CITY OF LONDON FOR EXAMPLE WE
IN MY VIEW YOU WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO SAY NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT THEY OUTVOTE AS THEY HAVE A MAJORITY AND ALL THE INSTITUTIONS THEY CAN AND THEY WILL DECIDE TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THEIR INTERESTS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST WILL BE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE BUT THE LOGIC OF YOUR POSITION IS THAT YOU LEAVE YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE HEN SHE SAY
WELL WHAT WE DO IT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LEAVE AS WE CAN TAKE DECISIONS OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST SO THE LAWS WE PASS OF THE LAWS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY IS WERE PUBLISHING A DOCUMENT ON MAKING A SPEECH THAT SETS HAD ALL OF THE AREAS IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL CARRY ON LEGISLATING FOR US THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE WILL CARRY ON TAKING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE UNITED KINGDOM
WE WILL HAVE NO ABILITY TO CHANGE ALL OF THAT OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE CAN TAKE DECISIONS MAKE LAWS THAT ARE IN OUR OWN NATIONAL INTEREST
THE PRIME MINISTER IS ALSO MAKING A SPEECH TODAY AND HE IS GOING TO SAY THAT THOSE WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR OUT I THINK THAT THE LOSS OF JOBS AND
TO BUSINESSES IS A PRICE WORTH PAYING I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ACCEPT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THERE WILL BE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON JOBS BUT THAT'S WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN FOR THE FA FOR ANOTHER GREATER GOOD NO THAT'S SIMPLY NOT RIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER AND WE WILL HAVE A LIVELY DEBATE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL STAY GOOD FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES WILL REDUCE OVER THIS IS WHEN I SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH HIM OVER
IT'S ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE JOBS FIRST OF ALL EUROPEAN UNION REGULATIONS COST JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY THEY INCREASED COSTS FOR BUSINESS THEY MAKE IT LESS DESIRABLE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE UNITED KINGDOM BUT ASS WE FORGE OUR OWN WAY IN THE WORLD AS WE AGREE FREE TRADE DEALS WITH COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA THOSE PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE THE ECONOMIES ARE GROWING FAST WHETHER A REAL OPPORTUNITIES WE WILL CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
NOT LOSE THEM SO I'LL CUT ON MY BIGGEST MARKET OF COURSE EUROPE WELL THE REAL QUESTION ABOUT A TRADING RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE IS OF COURSE WE BUY FAR MORE FROM THEM THAN THEY BUY FROM US SO IT IS ABOUT THEM NEEDING TO KEEP ACCESS TO OUR MARKET SURE BUT ARE YOU EXPECTING THEM TO TURN ROUND SO YES YOU CAN STILL BE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET WHAT I'M NOT EXPECTS THEM TO DO IS TURN ROUND AND SAY TO GERMAN CAR MANUFACTURERS OR TO FRENCH FARMERS SORRY GUYS YOU'RE NOT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SELL IN UNITED KINGDOM ANY MORE THEY NEED TO DO ANY FREE TRADE DEAL WITH US BECAUSE WE ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT MARKET FOR THEM
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF JOBS ALL ACROSS EUROPE THE DEPEND ON UNITED KINGDOM CONSUMERS TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT THAT IN JEOPARDY AND THERE'S A PRICE TO BE PAID THOUGH ALWAYS AND FOR MANY COUNTRIES WHO ARE PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET IT IS ALSO ALLOWING FOR EXAMPLE THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING THAT BUT DO YOU DO EXCEPT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME PRICE TO BE PAID IN RETURN FOR THAT SUCH ACCESS TO BOTH WAYS TO TRADE BOTH WET WELL IT IS IN THEIR INTEREST FOR THAT TRADE TO CONTINUE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PRICE TO PAY
THE PRICE TO ACCESS THE UNITED KINGDOM MARKET TO SELL TO BRITISH CONSUMERS WE BUY FAR MORE FROM THEM THAN THEY BUY FROM US SO EUROPEAN BUSINESSES WILL LOSE IF WE DON'T HAVE TRADING ARRANGEMENTS AND THAT'S WHY WE WILL HAVE TRADING ARRANGEMENTS IS THE QUEEN A SUPPORTER OF YOUR CALLS THAT HOME ONE THE THINGS I AM I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL I PRESIDE OVER THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT THE QUEEN FIRST OF ALL SHE IS A FANTASTIC MOMENT FOR THIS COUNTRY OF THE HUGEST RESPECT FOR HER
BUT WHATEVER SHE SAYS IS ALWAYS TO BE KEPT IN PRIVATE AND SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY SCRUPULOUS ABOUT NOT BEING POLITICAL POLITICALLY PARTIES AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES US SUCH GREAT MONARCH AND SO GIVEN THAT SHE USED WHAT YOU SAID THERE THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT WHO IN THE PRIVY COUNCIL IS BLABBING WHAT I HAVE NO IDEA
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY THAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS MORNING AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON THEM I'M REALLY ASKING IS BECAUSE CLEARLY IT'S ASKING ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT IF SOMEBODY IS BREAKING CONFIDENCES IN THAT WAY FROM THE PRIVY COUNCIL SHOULD THERE BE AN INVESTIGATION THERE CLEARLY IS GOING TO BE AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE PALACES ASKED IPSO THE BODY THAT REVIEWS STORIES OF THIS KIND TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS AND IF THE RIGHT AND PROPER BODY TO DO THAT WHAT IS IT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A BLEAK INVESTIGATION AND MANY PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MANY
WELL WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE POWERS AND THE PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION USED TO THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S STILL THERE RIGHT SOUTHERN ENGLAND LEICESTER GO TO STORE ARE THEY BICKER AND YOU DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE GETTING INVOLVED TO SAY LOOK HOLD ON THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR SYSTEM A PRIVY COUNCILLORS IF THEY'RE SAYING WHAT THE QUEEN SAID WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE STORY CAME FROM WHETHER THE STORY'S ACCURATE I HAVE NO ABILITY TO JUDGE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OR HE'S GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE PRESS COMPLAINTS BODY AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT ORGANISATION TO LOOK AT IT
YOU JUST A LITTLE EARLIER YOU SAID WE'RE HAVING A LIVELY DEBATE WE'LL ALL END UP FRIENDS THE PRIME MINISTER'S TALKING TODAY ABOUT MAKING CASE IN A CALM AND RATIONAL WAY IT SOUNDS EXTRAORDINARY THAT HERE YOU ARE CRITICISING THE NEGOTIATION THAT YOUR OWN PRIME MINISTER BROUGHT BACK FROM BRUSSELS CANNAE READ CAN YOU ALL REALLY END UP AS FRIENDS I BELIEVE SO THAT PEOPLE EXPECT IN MODERN POLITICS
A GROWN UP DISCUSSION THEY DON'T EXPECT US ALL TO BE AUTOMATONS I HAVE HUGE RESPECT FOR THE PRIME MINISTER HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB THIS COUNTRY ON THIS ISSUE WE DISAGREE AND I'M IMMENSELY GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR GIVING PEOPLE THE FREEDOM TO SAY SO YES WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LIVELY DEBATE WE DISCUSSED THE ISSUES AND AT THE END OF THE DAY HE WILL CARRY ON BEING GREAT PRIME MINISTER WHO I RESPECT ENORMOUSLY CHRIS GRAYLING THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FALLOUT CONTINUES FROM THE SUN STORY ABOUT THE QUEEN'S ALLEGED VIEWS ON THE E.U. THE SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINT BY BUCKINGHAM PALACE THROWN A WOBBLY IS A HEADLINE IN THE SUN AS IT STANDS BY ITS STORY MADE THE EDITOR HIMSELF DOING VERY FORCEFULLY JUST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO AGO THE SUN SAYS THE POLLING FIRM YOU GARB HAS FOUND THAT THE QUEEN IS STATISTICALLY IN A GROUP HIGHLY LIKELY TO BACK A BRITISH ACT STICK SEVENTY THREE PERCENT WOMEN OVER SIXTY WITHOUT A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
ARE IN FAVOUR THE GUARDIAN BELIEVES THAT EXECUTIVES AT THE SUN ARE RELAXED ABOUT ADDRESSING THE COMPLAINT THEY WERE ABOUT THE PALACE'S RESPONSE AS HER HILARIOUS OVERREACTION NOT AMUSED IS THE HEADLINE IN THE EXPRESS IS IT REPORTS THAT THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GAVE US UNDER SUSPICION AS THE SOURCE OF THE CLAIM TELEGRAPH SAYS CALLS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE CABINET SECRETARY JEREMY HAYWOOD TO INVESTIGATE THERE IT SAYS FRIENDS OF MY GAVE INSIST HE HAS NO IDEA WHO WAS BEHIND THE LEAK
STEPHEN GLOVER WRITING IN THE MALE POINT OUT THAT THE QUEEN IS UNDOUBTEDLY A FIERCE PATRIOT AND BRITISH UNIONIST AND THAT HE'D BE AMAZED IF SHE WERE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A CONCERNED YOU'RE A SCEPTIC BUT ANDY MAKE SMITH IN THE INDEPENDENT ARGUES THAT ON THE FEW OCCASIONS WHEN SHE HAS LET HER SLIP SLIP A COMMENT THE QUEEN HAS COME OVER AS A SMALL C. CONSERVATIVE SCEPTICAL OF RADICAL CHANGE AND UNLIKELY TO SUPPORT SO CALLED BRECK'S IT FOR THE DAILY MIRROR'S ROYAL REPORTER VICTORIA MURPHY THE QUEEN'S ABILITY TO REMAIN ABOVE POLITICS HAS BEEN KEY TO HER SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL
AN EXPERT ON THE MONARCHY TELLS A STAR IT'S ABSURD TO SUGGEST THE CREAM A BREAK FROM TRADITION AND TAKE SIDES AFTER SIXTY YEARS OF ACTING CONSTITUTIONALLY FINANCIAL TIMES JUST DAVID CAMERON WANTS MADE EASIER FOR NEW UNIVERSITIES TO BE ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE PRIME MINISTER ARE SAID TO BE PLANNING TO INCLUDE A BILL IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH THAT WOULD BROADEN ACCESS TO NEW PROVIDERS THAT PAPER DESCRIBES IT AS A RETURN TO THATCHERITE UNIVERSITY REFORMS AND SAYS IT'S REGARDED AS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR EFFORTS TO REUNITE A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT'S DIVIDED OVER THE
NUMBER OF THE PAPERS CARRY REPORT THAT'S FOUND THAT ALMOST SIX THOUSAND FOREIGN CRIMINALS ELIGIBLE FOR DEBT DEPORTATION HAVE BEEN RELEASED TO LIVE IN BRITAIN A RATE OF ALMOST FIVE A DAY THE TIMES ADS IT ALMOST A THIRD OF THEM WERE FREED MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO TELEGRAPH SAYS MANY WILL HAVE USED THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AS A REASON TO REMAIN
AND THE TIMES REELS THAT WORSHIPPERS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE SHAME OF FAILING TO DROP A BIG BANK NOTE INTO THE COLLECTION PLATE AS CHURCHES ARE INCREASINGLY EXCEPT INTONATIONS OF OUR MOBILE PHONE APP IT SAYS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED CHURCH OF ENGLAND PARISHES RECEIVE MONEY THROUGH THE CHURCH UP WHILE THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND ENCOURAGES TEXT MESSAGE BASED GIVING MANY MOSQUES HAVE ALSO MOVED ON MUCH
THE TIME IS THEIR SIXTY MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM MADE IN THE BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE TODAY THAT AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ATHLETES WHO TOOK PART IN THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS IN BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WERE TAKING MEL DAMIEN
THE DRUG NOW BANNED BUT THE TENNIS STAR MARIA SHARAPOVA HAS ADMITTED USING WE CAN TALK TO DOCTOR CHRIS BEADY HIS READER IN THE SCHOOL OF HUMAN AND LIFE SCIENCES AT CANTERBURY CHRIST CHURCH UNIVERSITY AND IS ON THE LINE AH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST HAVE YOU SURPRISED NO
WE HUNT THINK ITSELF THAN WELL YOU HAVE TO PUT IT INTO CONTEXT FIRSTLY MEL AND WAS NOT
ON THE LIST UNTIL THE FIRST OF JANUARY THIS YEAR THE BUT HANG ON IT WAS A MEDICINE FOR DID DODGY HEARTS AND POTENTIALLY FOR DIABETES YOU COULD IT WOULD BE ODD WOULD MAYBE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ATHLETES TAKING PART IN A EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP OR HAD THOSE CONDITION WELL YES AND NO IT DOES ILLUSTRATE THE INCREASINGLY BLURRED LINES BETWEEN THE USE OF LEGITIMATE MEDICINES AND ILLEGAL ILLEGAL USE IN SPORT
IT ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE THE LENGTHS THAT ATHLETES AND THEIR SUPPORT TEAMS WILL GO TO TO TO GAINING THAT ELUSIVE EDGE IN COMPETITION AND I THINK THE APPROACH OF MANY IS THAT IF SOMETHING IS NOT EXPLICITLY AND IT'S NOT EXPLICIT THE ILLEGAL THEN IT IS FAIR CAME TO YOU SAT SUBSTANCE AND THESE FOUR HUNDRED NINETY WERE NOT IT OR MOST OF THEM ONE ASSUMES WERE NOT ONLY LOOK LIKE THIS
THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE CERTAINLY CASES WHERE ATHLETES TO HAVE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND ARE TREATED AND A THERAPEUTIC USE EXEMPTIONS OUR PLIGHT IN THOSE SITUATIONS AND THAT THIS IS AN ACCEPTED PART OF THE INCLUSIVITY OF SPORT WE CAN BE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT THAT DIDN'T APPLY TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OR SO OF THOSE ATHLETES AND THE WIDER CONTACTS WELL AS AS YOU WERE SUGGESTING
IS THAT IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE ISN'T IT AND THERE MAY WELL BE OTHER MEDICINES I SUPPOSE THAT A LOT OF ATHLETES ARE TAKING THAT THAT ALSO WILL
THE BAND OR NEED TO BE BANNED PRETTY SOON YES IT'S AN ARMS RACE I THINK AS SOON AS THE AGENCY'S PICK UP ON ONE PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE AND ATHLETES DECIDE TO STOP USING THAT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A MOVEMENT TOWARDS ANOTHER AND THERE'S A CONSTANT A CONSTANT SEARCH REALLY FOR THEIR NEXT MAGIC BULLET IN THIS CONTACT AND YOU JUST WONDER AT WHAT COST TO THE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR BODIES
OFTEN SUBSTANTIAL I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN ALMOST ONE HUNDRED DOCUMENTED DEATHS RESULTING DIRECTLY FROM THE USE OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS IN SPORT AND IF THERE'S ONE HUNDRED THAT ARE DOCUMENTED THERE WILL BE MANY MANY MORE WHICH ARE NOT SO CLEARLY IDENTIFIED BUT WHICH NO DOUBT WELL I HOPE THAT DIRECTLY RELATED TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DRUGS
IT'S A IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE TO SPORT AND TO SOCIETY GENERALLY BECAUSE THE USE OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS IN SPORT IS NOW SLIPPING DOWN INTO FOR EXAMPLE THE THIS SORT OF EXERCISE CULTURE IN THE U.K. IT SEEPING DOWN TO SCHOOLS IT IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO ALL OF THE AGENCIES CONCERNED DOCTOR CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS FRANCIS CAMPBELL WHO IS VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SIR I'M GOOD MORNING TRUST ON TUESDAY EVENING I ATTENDANT INVENT AN AND ARCHBISHOPS HEISS AND WESTMINSTER WERE THREE RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAT DYING TOGETHER TO DISCUSS HOW THEY LIVE AS CREATIVE MINORITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
EACH LEADER THE CHIEF RABBI REPRESENTING JUDAISM MALIGN ASSAYED RISK FAE REPRESENTING ISLAM AND CARDINAL ECCLES REPRESENTING CHRISTIANITY BROUGHT A UNIQUE PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE TO THE TOPIC
EACH HAD QUITE A DIFFERENT HISTORY OF BEING A MINORITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHICH WAS NOT ALWAYS A BENIGN EXPERIENCE THE CHIEF RABBI REMINDED US THAT THE JEWS WERE BANISHED FROM THE COUNTRY AND TWELVE NINETY ONLY TO RETURN WITH LIMITED RIGHTS UNDER CROMWELL BUT WITH FULL RIGHTS AND YOUR TEAM FIFTY YEAR
THE CARDINAL SPOKE OF THE SUPPRESSION OF CATHOLICISM FROM THE SIXTEENTH TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURIES AND MALIGN HER RIBS VEE REMINDED US OF ISLAM'S RELATIVELY MODERN ARRIVAL IN THE U.K. AND HOW HIS RELIGION COULD LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY
DESPITE DIFFERENT HISTORIES ALL THREE SPOKE WITH A COMMON GRAMMAR ABOUT HOW TO BE CREATIVE MINORITIES IN THE U.K.
FOR THE CHIEF RABBI THE PRINCIPAL ISSUE WAS HOW TO INTEGRATE BUT NOT A SIMILE IT I'D TO GIVE ALTER YOUR SOCIETY BUT TO RETAIN YOUR IDENTITY
MY LLAMA SAYEED SPOKE ABOUT THE SHIFTING ATTITUDES BETWEEN DIFFERENT GENERATIONS AND THE TRANSITION FROM FEAR AND DISCRIMINATION TO ACCEPTANCE AND INCLUSION THE CARDINAL EMPHASISE THE CENTRAL PLACE THAT EDUCATION HAD CLEARED AND CATHOLIC INTEGRATION
LISTENING TO THESE MINORITY VOICES WHICH BETWEEN THEM HAD EXPERIENCED CENTURIES OF SUPPRESSION AND PERSECUTION DESCRIBED THE U.K. TODAY AS A TRULY RESPECTFUL AND PLURALIST SOCIETY SPOKE POWERFULLY ABOUT CONTEMPORARY BRITAIN AND WHAT IT HAS ACHIEVED OFTEN THROUGH PAINFUL HISTORY IN LESSONS THE GREATEST ACCOLADE A SOCIETY CAN RECEIVE HIS PREAS FROM ITS MINORITIES ABOUT HOW THEY ARE TREATED
IT WAS FORTHCOMING ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE LARNER SAYEED SAID IN A SENSE LONDON HAS MORE ISLAMIC VALUES THAN MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES I FEEL MORE ISLAMIC HERE I CAN PRACTISE MY FIERCE AND GIVE RESPECT TO OTHER FAITHS AND CARE FOR OTHERS
WELL ALL IS NOT PERFECT AND INTEGRATION AS A WORK IN PROGRESS I HAVE WE REACHED THIS POINT
WE BUILT A PLURALIST ENVIRONMENT WHICH INCLUDES RATHER THAN EXCLUDES AND HAS OVERCOME MANY CENTURIES OF GETTING IT WRONG
IN PART IT MUST COME DOWN TO AN OPENNESS WHICH ALLOWS US ALL TO BE JEWISH CATHOLIC MUZZLE THEM OR TO HOLD ANY OTHER RELIGIOUS CULTURAL OR ETHNIC IDENTITY AND BE CITIZENS OF THE U.K. AND TO SEE THOSE DIFFERENCES NOT AS DETRACTING FROM NATIONAL IDENTITY BUT ENHANCING
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH FRANCIS CAMPBELL IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE'S ANOTHER TWIST TO REPORT THIS MORNING IN THE LONG AND SHOCKING SAGA OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE DUPED INTO HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS SPIED ON AND THEN LEFT BY MEN WHOSE REAL IDENTITY THEY NEVER KNEW METROPOLITAN POLICE HAS APOLOGISED FOR THE ABUSE BUT WHAT OF THE MEN WHO TOOK PART
ONE OF THE DUPED WOMEN HELEN SMITH HAS GONE A STEP FURTHER AND TRACKED DOWN AND CONFRONTED JOHN DINES HE HAD BEEN WITH HER FOR TWO YEARS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES BEFORE TELLING HER THAT HE WAS HAVING A BREAKDOWN AND DISAPPEARING
SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE DEAD NOW ALL THESE YEARS LATER SHE HAS TRACKED HIM DOWN HE WORKS IN SYDNEY IN AUSTRALIA FOR A UNIVERSITY WHERE POLICE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED AND A FEW DAYS AGO HE WAS DUE TO BE MEETING SOME OF THEM AT THE AIRPORT HELEN STILL DECIDED TO GO TO AUSTRALIA
I WENT TO THE AIRPORT BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THE DELEGATION OF INDIAN POLICE OFFICERS WOULD BE ARRIVING AT THAT TIME AND I THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE THERE I HADN'T ACTUALLY PLAN TO CONFRONT HIM BUT WHEN I SAW HIM I DECIDED THAT I WOULD GO UP AND SPEAK TO HIM WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU SAW HIM
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW I QUITE A LOT
YEAH I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME AND ALTHOUGH HE I SUPPOSE YOU KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SEE HIM I JUST THE PREPARATION FOR THAT MOMENT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME TO MUCH WHEN IT ACTUALLY CAME TO SEEING HIM IN THE FLESH
WELL I HAVE I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND I GUESS YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THINGS GO THROUGH YOUR MIND YOU KNOW IMAGINING HOW PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED
AND ACTUALLY TO A LARGE EXTENT WHAT ON EARTH IT HAD ALL BEEN ABOUT AND WHY HE HAD BEEN PREPARED TO ACT IN SUCH AN ABUSIVE WHY ALL THOSE YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO
AND YEAH I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE JUST TO SEE WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE AND WHAT HE WAS DOING NOW DID HE RECOGNISE YOU IMMEDIATELY ONCE I SAID
I BASICALLY APPROACHED HIM AND SAID YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY AT WHICH POINT HE SAID APOLOGIES AND THEN I SAID THAT I WANTED TO TALK MORE AND WE THEN
WENT AND SPOKE FOR A WHILE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND
YEAH WHY HE HAD DECEIVED ME AND THE WAY HE DECEIVED ME AND HE WAS PROPERLY APOLOGETIC DID YOU FEEL
I THINK HE RECOGNISES THAT WHAT HE'S DONE WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT HE'D BEEN HARMED BY THE SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION SQUAD THAT HE WAS PART OF BUT
I DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S ENOUGH
I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT HE'S STILL IN A POSITION WHERE HE MAY BE TRAINING OTHER OFFICERS OR INFLUENCING THE TRAINING FOR OTHER OFFICERS WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM NOW
UM
I FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEY DID BUT THERE IS THE BIGGER PICTURE OF THE SUPERVISING OFFICERS AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM
ENABLED THIS ABUSE TO TAKE PLACE AND THAT'S MY MAIN CONCERN AT THE MOMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THESE KIND OF ABUSES DON'T GO ON IN EITHER THE U.K. OR IN ANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE IT IS VERY WORRYING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF FORMER
OFFICERS FROM THESE UNITS DO SEEM TO EITHER MOVE INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR INTO TRAINING OF OTHER OFFICERS WHAT THE UNIVERSITY SAY THE UNIVERSITY WHERE HE'S WORKING NOW IS THAT HE DOES NOT TRAIN POLICE OFFICERS THEY'VE ISSUED A STATEMENT TO US AND WHICH THEY SAY HE DOES NOT HE'S NEVER WORKED IN AWE WITH THE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF POLICING STUDIES THROUGH WHICH IT DELIVERS PLEASE RECRUIT TRAINING THEY SAY HE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PERSON DO YOU ACCEPT
THE DOCUMENT THAT I SAW THAT WERE SIGNED BY HIM HAD UNDERNEATH HIS NAME COURSE DIRECTOR AND THAT DOESN'T SOUND AS THOUGH IT'S JUST AN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION AYE
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE SOME INVOLVEMENT IN ARRANGING THE COURSE AND MAY HAVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE AND MY MY AS I SAID MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ARE NOT REPLICATED AROUND THE WORLD AND YOU KNOW HOW WE GOT TO AUSTRALIA AND WHO PAID FOR HIM TO GO THERE
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I WENT TO NEW ZEALAND
AS PART OF MY SEARCH AND AT THAT POINT THE POLICE THEN
THE POLICE IN THE U.K. THEN PAID FOR HIM TO BE RELOCATED TO AUSTRALIA I THINK IT'S APPALLING THAT AT A TIME WHEN THEY KNEW I WAS EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT MY FORMER PARTNER AND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM THAT RATHER THAN COMING OUT AND TELLING ME THE TRUTH AND SAVING ME YEARS OF DISTRESS THEY INSTEAD ACTED TO RELOCATE HIM WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONCERN FOR YOU KNOW FOR ME
JUST FINALLY YOU MENTION THERE'S YEARS OF DISTRESS HAVE THE HAVE YOU REBUILT SURE YOUR LIFE
OBVIOUSLY IVORY BELT MY LIFE BUT THE FACT IS THAT THESE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND MINE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE ARE VERY MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED IN THIS WAY BY UNDERCOVER POLICE INFILTRATING POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IT HAS DEVASTATING AND LONG TERM IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE AND
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN JUST KIND OF FLICK A SWITCH AND IT GOES AWAY AND THAT IS OUR PRIMARY CAN PRIMARY REASON FOR BRINGING THE CASE WE'VE GOT THE APOLOGY FROM THE MET POLICE THAT WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND I THINK THAT THE STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN NOW ARE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE FORMER OFFICERS WHO WERE IN THESE UNITS AND TWO
WHEREVER COMPANIES ORGANISATIONS THEY'VE GONE TO AROUND THE WORLD SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THESE METHODS THAT WERE USED IN THE PAST AND KNOWLEDGE TO TO BE ABUSIVE AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE FUTURE HELEN STEEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THANK YOU
AND JOHN DIMES THE FORMER POLICE OFFICERS DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST FOR AN INTERVIEW BUT HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER THAT HE MET HELEN STEEL ON THE SIXTH OF MARCH AND HE GAVE HER A PERSONAL AND UNRESERVED APOLOGY FOR ALL AND ANY HURT THAT SHE MAY HAVE SUFFERED
THE TIME IS NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECASTER LOUISE LIZ TACTLESS LEWIS GOOD MORNING THERE'S A WEST EAST SPLIT SO FAR THIS MORNING FURTHER WEST YOU'VE GOT SOME LOVELY SUNSHINE BUT IT IS COLD MINUS SIX MINUS SEVEN DEGREES IN THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND AT THE MOMENT BUT YOU KEEP THE SUNSHINE ALONG WEST FACING COAST TODAY ELSEWHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CLOUD AND UNDER THE CLOUD SOME DRIZZLE IT TO FEEL RATHER COLD AND DRAB SO FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IT'S A CHILLY START

THE CLOCK YOU'RE LISTENING TODAY ARE READY FOR SO MONTACUTE AND JUSTIN
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING A LONG AWAITED REPORT INTO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY HAS PROPOSED TARIFF PRICE CAMPS FOR VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO GET LOWER BILLS BY SWITCHING SUPPLIERS EVERY CAMERON IS TO ACCUSE THOSE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE E.U. HAVE REGARDING THE LOSS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS AND BUSINESSES THAT COULD FOLLOW AS A PRICE WORTH PAYING THE EDITOR OF THE SUN HAS DEFENDED THE PAPERS CLAIM THAT THE QUEEN'S SUPPORTS AN EXIT FROM THE E.U. SAME STORY CAME FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
POLICE IN ESSEX SAY THEY NOW BELIEVE THE NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL AND FRAUDSTER JOHN PALMER WAS MURDERED BY A PROFESSIONAL HIT MAN IN A CAREFULLY PLANNED ATTACK THE B.B.C. NEWSROOM THIS MORNING BY SEB SENSE
THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG AS BIT FORWARD A SET OF PROPOSALS DESIGNED HELP HOUSEHOLDS OBTAIN BETTER VALUE FOR THEIR MONEY THEY PAY FOR ENERGY FOLLOWING A LENGTHY INVESTIGATION THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY WANTS TO INCREASE PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AND ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS WHO SHOWN RELUCTANCE IN THE PAST TO CHANGE THEIR POWER SUPPLY INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT JOHN MOYLAN REPORTS
THE C.M.A. SAYS THAT WHILE CUSTOMERS ON FIXED TARIFFS DO BENEFIT FROM COMPETITION AND ENERGY THERE'S ON STANDARD TARIFFS DON'T AND HOUSEHOLDS AND SMALL FIRMS HAVE PAID ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS A YEAR MORE FOR THEIR ENERGY THAN THEY SHOULD HAVE DUE TO A LACK OF COMPETITION
TO REMEDY THAT THE SAME IS PROPOSING THAT OFF GEMMA KEEPS A DATABASE OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON STANDARD TARIFFS FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE RIVALS CAN THEN USE THAT TO DIRECTLY MARKET CUSTOMERS WITH BETTER DEALS
BUT THE SEAL MAY ALSO BELIEVE SOME CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T SWITCH NEED PROTECTING SO HE'S PROPOSING A TRANSITIONAL PRICE CONTROL FOR THE FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON PREPAYMENT METERS WHICH WILL RUN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE SMART METER RULE OUT IS COMPLETE
THESE ARE MAJOR INTERVENTIONS AND OUR ENERGY MARKET AND THE C.M.A. PROPOSING A HOST OF OTHER REMEDIES TO BUT THE BIG SUPPLIERS COULD PUSH BACK AGAINST PLANS TO RELEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS' DATA AND BY TARGETING THOSE ON PREPAYMENT METERS IT'S POSSIBLE MANY OTHER VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS WILL MISS OUT ON CHEAPER BILLS
THE REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION RUNS TWO THOUSAND PAGES SMALLER ENERGY COMPANIES SAY IT WILL TAKE TIME TO ASSESS HOW THE PROPOSALS WITH WORK JULIET DEVONPORT OF THE RENEWABLE POWER SUPPLY GOOD ENERGY TOLD US THAT CUSTOMERS HAD TO BE PROVIDED WITH RELIABLE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO SWITCH TO A NEW COMPANY
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER IS THE CENTRE OF THIS SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE MARKETED TO BUY LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT MARKET COMING THROUGH YOUR DOOR YOU NEED A REALLY GOOD OPT OUT CLAUSE I THINK THIS HAS STILL GOT TO BE WORKED THROUGH AND REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH AS WELL AND I THINK WE NEED TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES ABOUT HOW DO THEY WANT YOUR CONTACTS
DAVID CAMERON WILL TODAY ACCUSE THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAVE REGARDING THE LOSS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS AND BUSINESSES THAT COULD FOLLOW AS A PRICE WORTH PAYING IT WILL ALSO SET OUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE POSITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT BRITAIN WOULD GAIN FROM STAYING IN HIS REMARKS HAVE ANGERED LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WHO HAVE DESCRIBED THEM AS UNWORTHY OF A PRIME MINISTER IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
ALTHOUGH NUMBER TEN INSIST EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP HIS CLAIM THAT THOSE WHO WISH TO LEAVE A PREPARED TO SEE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS AND BUSINESSES WILL INCENSE MANY MISTER CAMERON SIGHTING REMARKS BY BORIS JOHNSON AND OTHERS WILL CLAIM THE LEAVE SIDE BELIEVE THE ECONOMIC SHOCK OF BRECHT SAID IS A PRICE WORTH PAYING AND COLLATERAL DAMAGE
MISTER CAMERON WILL ALSO SUGGEST LEAVING THE Y. YOU COULD RESULT IN HIGHER MORTGAGES BECAUSE OF PRESSURE ON THE POUND AND INTEREST RATES BUT LEAVE CAMPAIGN THIS MORNING SAID MISTER CAMERON'S COMMENTS WERE UNKNOWN PRIME MINISTERIAL SCAREMONGERING AND SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE CABINET MINISTER CHRIS GRAYLING WHO BACKS BRECHT SAID INSISTED JOB PROSPECTS WOULD BE BETTER OUTSIDE THE E.U.
IT'S ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE JOBS FIRST OF ALL EUROPEAN UNION REGULATIONS COST JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY THEY INCREASED COSTS FOR BUSINESS THEY MAKE IT LESS DESIRABLE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE UNITED KINGDOM
BUT THAT'S WE FORGE OUR OWN WAY IN THE WORLD AS WE AGREE FREE TRADE DEALS WITH COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA WE WILL CREATE JOBS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM NOT LOSE THEM IN A SPEECH LATER THIS MORNING MY GREYLING WILL ARGUE THAT THE E. YOU DEAL REACHED BY MISTER CAMERON FAILED TO RETURN POWERS FROM BRUSSELS AND MAY ACTUALLY HAVE WEAKENED BRITAIN'S BARGAINING POSITION IN THE Y.
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DISTINGUISH SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE U.K. IN A LETTER TO THE TIMES PROFESSOR STEPHEN HAWKING AND OTHER FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SO MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. HAS INCREASED FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND HAS ALLOWED ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN BRITAIN TO ATTRACT TALENTED SCIENTIST FROM THE REST OF EUROPE
THE EDITOR OF THE SUN TONY GALLAGHER SAID THE NEWSPAPER STANDS BY ITS CLAIM THAT THE QUEEN HAS VOICED HER SUPPORT FOR A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE E.U. MY GALLAGHER SAID MULTIPLE SOURCES SUGGESTED SHE MADE HER COMMENTS ARE TWO EVENTS INCLUDING AT A LUNCH WITH SENIOR POLITICIANS FIVE YEARS AGO BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS LAUNCHED A FORMAL COMPLAINT INSISTING THE MONARCH IS POLITICALLY NEUTRAL MISTER GALLAGHER SAYS HIS JOURNALISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DERELICT IN THEIR DUTY IF THEY HAVEN'T RUN THE STORY
WE ARE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT THAT THE QUEEN'S VIEWS WERE EXPRESSED EXACTLY AS WE'D OUTLINED THEM IN BOTH THE HEADLINE AND THEIR STORY AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT WE KNEW MUCH MORE THAN WE PUBLISHED AND THAT REMAINS THE CASE IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE'S NOT JUST ONE OCCASION WHEN THESE VIEWS WERE WHERE THEY WERE IN NO DOUBT THAT THE STORY IS ACCURATE
N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS WARNED OF A MORE DIFFICULT TIME IN HOSPITALS AS THE LATER STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS ENTERS ITS SECOND DAY IT'S HER PLANS WERE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS ANY INCREASE IN PRESSURE ON SERVICES THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS APOLOGISED FOR THE DISRUPTION BUT SAID THE FORTY EIGHT HOUR WALKOUT WAS NECESSARY TO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON
SO FAR HOSPITAL SEEM TO BE COPING WELL WITH THE STRIKE BUT WITH HER SECOND DAY WITHOUT THE NORMAL NUMBERS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS THINGS ARE EXPECTED TO GET HARDER CONTINGENCY MEASURES HAVE SEEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OPERATIONS AND TREATMENTS CANCELLED BUT N.H.S. ENGLAND'S DOCTOR AND RAINS BREE IS CONCERNED THAT HOSPITALS MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS
THAT'S BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF JUNIOR DOCTORS TO CHASE TEST RESULTS AND GET PATIENT'S READY TO GO HOME SHE WARNED IT COULD CAUSE A BACKLOG ON HOSPITAL WARDS THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS SAID IT DEEPLY REGRETS THE DISRUPTION BUT THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO FORCE THROUGH CHANGES TO JUNIOR DOCTORS PAY AND CONDITIONS WHICH IT BELIEVES ARE UNFAIR AND UNSAFE
THIS LATEST WALK OUT IS THE THIRD IN THE DISPUTE BUT IT'S THE LONGEST SO FAR TWO MORE FORTY EIGHT HOUR STRIKES ARE PLANNED FOR APRIL
IRELAND'S NEW PARLIAMENT WILL MEET TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE COUNTRY'S INCONCLUSIVE GENERAL ELECTION MEMBERS OF THE DAWN WILL BE TRYING TO ELECT A NEW PRIME MINISTER TO REPLACE AND TO KENNY BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THEY'LL SUCCEED WITH NEGOTIATIONS TO FORM A COALITION GOVERNMENT LIKELY TO TAKE WEEKS TO RESOLVE
POLICE IN ESSEX SAY THE NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL JOHN PALMER HE WAS FOUND DEAD AT HIS HOME LAST JUNE WAS MURDERED BY A PROFESSIONAL HIT MAN HE'LL USE THE B.B.C.'S CRIMEWATCH PROGRAMME TO APPEAL FOR HELP FROM THE PUBLIC IN CATCHING THOSE WHO COMMISSIONED AND CARRIED OUT HIS KILLING IN A WIRE STRIPPER
JOHN PALMER WHO WAS NICKNAMED GOLDFINGER FIRST CAME TO PUBLIC ATTENTION WHEN HE WAS CLEARED OF INVOLVEMENTS IN THE BRINKS MAT RAID AT HEATHROW AIRPORT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE HE WAS JAILED FOR MAKING MILLIONS OUT OF PROPERTY FRAUD
WHEN HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS GARDEN IN ESSEX LAST YEAR POLICE INITIALLY THOUGHT HE'D SUFFERED A CARDIAC ARREST A POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION LATER REVEALED HE'D BEEN SHOT IN THE CHEST SIX TIMES
NOW DETECTIVES SAY THAT JOHN PALMER'S DEATH BEARS ALL THE HALLMARKS OF A PROFESSIONAL HIT HE WAS SHOT IN A SPOTS NOT COVERED BY C. C. T. V. IT'S POSSIBLE A SILENCER WAS USED AND THE CRIME SCENE WAS LEFT STRIPPED OF EVIDENCE
POLICE HAVE ALSO REVEALED SEVERAL POTENTIAL MOTIVES INCLUDING POSSIBLE LINKS TO THE GANG WHO CARRIED OUT THE HATTON GARDEN HEIST AND PALMER'S UPCOMING TRIAL IN SPAIN FOR FRAUD
AND YOU CAN SEE CRIMEWATCH AT NINE O'CLOCK THIS EVENING ON B.B.C. ONE THE SUPERMARKET GROUP MORRISON'S HAS REPORTED ANNUAL PROFITS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION THAT'S DOWN FROM THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION A YEAR AGO THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CLOSING STORES TO CUT COSTS
A WOMAN WHO WAS DUPED INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER HAS DESCRIBED HOW SHE TRACKED HIM DOWN IN AUSTRALIA OR THAN TWENTY YEARS LATER HELEN STEEL MEANT THE OFFICER WHEN SHE WAS A GREENPEACE ACTIVIST IN NINETEEN NINETY AND SHE HAD A TWO YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BEFORE HE HAD AN APPARENT BREAKDOWN AND DISAPPEARED
SHE SINCE FOUND OUT HIS REAL NAME WAS JOHN DINES AND HE WAS RELOCATED TO AUSTRALIA WHERE HE WORKS FOR UNIVERSITY WHERE POLICE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED SHE TOLD US WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE CONFRONTED HIM WHILE HE WAS ON A BUSINESS AT SYDNEY AIRPORT I BASICALLY APPROACHED HIM AND SAID YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY AT WHICH POINT HE SAID APOLOGIES AND THEN I SAID THAT I WANTED TO TALK MORE AND WE THEN
WENT AND SPOKE FOR A WHILE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY HE HAD DECEIVED ME AND THE WAY HE DECEIVED ME I THINK HE RECOGNISES THAT WHAT HE DID WAS WRONG BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT HE'D BEEN HARMED BY THE SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION SQUAD THAT HE WAS PART OF
POLICE IN SOUTH LONDON AND INVESTIGATING THE THEFT OF A NUMBER OF STUFFED ANIMALS FROM A TAXIDERMY WAREHOUSE THE THIEVES USED ANGLE GRINDERS TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE BUILDING IN WANDSWORTH BEFORE ESCAPING WITH A WHOLE VALUED AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE EIGHTEEN STUFFED ANIMALS TAKEN INCLUDED LIONS A GIRAFFE AND A CHIMPANZEE IN A TOP HAT
IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE U.K. HAVE TO PUT MONEY OFTEN VIA A CARD IN A METRE TO GET ELECTRICITY OR GAS THEY TEND TO BE THE POOREST HOUSEHOLDS IN THE COUNTRY AND YET THEY'RE THE ONES WHO PAY MORE THAN THEY SHOULD FOR THEIR ENERGY AND THAT'S WHY THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITIES TODAY PROPOSING TO INTERVENE IN THE MARKET AND CAP WHAT THEY'RE CHARGED
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'VE JUST PUBLISHED AFTER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH REVIEW INTO THE ENERGY MARKET WILL SPEAK TO THE MAN OVER THIS HE'S BEEN OVERSEEING IT IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST A REPORTER SUCH A BIRD WENT TO ONE FAMILY'S HOME IN CRICKLEWOOD IN NORTH WEST LONDON TO FIND OUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE USING A METRE
IN THE FRONT YARD OF HER SMALL TERRACED HOUSE ASMA HAS TO MOVE THE BINS TO GET TO HER METER IT'S FIXED TO THE OUTSIDE WALL IS SO LOW ANYWAY IT'S A SMALL COULD COMMISSION BUT IF THE WEATHER'S REALLY BAD OR PUT SHOPPING COMING OUT YOU KNOW WHEN THE GAS GOES OFF WHEN THERE'S A LOG
SIMPLE AS THAT TO GUTTERS GOES TO COME IN AND CHECK FOR YOUR EMERGENCY IF YOU'VE GOT EMERGENCY AVAILABLE THAT'S GREAT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT MUCH IS AVAILABLE WE WILL GO IN THE CAR YOU COULD FIND
SCHOOL WORK YOU'VE GOT TO GO DOWN TO THE SHOP WHAT TO TOP UP THE CARD SO YOU CAN PUT MY MONEY ON IT TO PUT MY MONEY ON THE COLOURED COS COS THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IF THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE CARD NO COLOUR IN THE WORLD WILL GIVE A GUESS HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT ON IT NOW SO I'M USING MY EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW SO
I'VE GOT TO POINT SEVENTY ON THE COURT AND URGENCY EVERY MUM URGENCY LAST NIGHT I WAS MAKING FOR THE KIDS LAST NIGHT WASN'T IT I WAS FRYING CHIPS ACTUALLY LAST NIGHT THAT GUS WENT OFF AND I HAD TO USE MUCH AS IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF COOKING AND A CHOICE SO NOW I'VE GOT THAT AND I'VE GOT TO MAKE DO THAT BY SUNDAY
SO FOR THE NEXT FOUR DAYS YOU'LL GET YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO POINT SEVENTY WORTH OF GAS SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THAT LAST I DO HAVE A CHOICE SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A LOSS ALL I'M GONNA DO IS USE A GAS FOR COOKING BECAUSE IN MY EYES WHAT CAN I DO I CAN WARN THE KIDS UP BY GIVING THEM EXTRA DUVETS AND BLANKETS BUT I CAN'T FEED THEM WORK OUT
IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT SO IT'S A CHOICE IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE TO FEED THE BOYS AND I DO HAVE A CHILD WITH HER SHE NEEDS WHICH MAKES THINGS SO MUCH MORE HARDER IS IT FRUSTRATING TO REALISE THAT THIS GAS IT'S ACTUALLY COSTING YOU MORE
THEN GAS ISN'T MEETING IT'S SO FRUSTRATING IT'S COSTING ME SO MUCH MORE AND IT'S GIVEN ME SUCH LITTLE BACK DID YOU ASK TO HAVE THE METER PUDDING NO IT ISN'T I CAME HOME ONE DAY WITH MY SON AND
STRAIGHT AWAY IMMEDIATELY WAS FREEZING COLD I WANT TO PUT THE GAS ON AND FOR THE HEATING ON AND HEATING IT WORK
AND IT WAS HER THERE'S A BIG RED STICKER SAYING WE'VE COME IN WE'VE CLOCKED YOUR OR YOUR BOILER HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD ME TO FAUNA NOW BUT IN THREE MONTHS AND IT'S WORKING
IN A WAY THIS WORKING IS WORKING IN A WAY IS WORKING IN A WAY BY BUS SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TIMES NO RICA PUNCHES HER IN THE STOMACH
HOW DO YOU MEAN HE PUNCHES YOU IN THE STOMACH COS THERE'S TWO OR THREE DAYS IN A WEEK WE DON'T YOU DON'T YOUR HOT FOOD YOU HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH STUFF OUT THE FRIDGE AND FOR YOU TWO KIDS AND SAY MAKE DO WITH IT YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THAT'S HER PUNCHES
SEEMA CALM AND SPEAKING TO SANCHA BURGH THERE WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE MAN OVERSEEING AT THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATION INTO THE ENERGY MARKET ROGER WHITCOMB A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THIS THE WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO DO TO METRES WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE IMPOSING A CAT
WELL THE DIFFERENCE IS AT THE MOMENT THAT PEOPLE ON PREPAYMENT METERS SUFFER
FROM THE FACT THAT THEY'D COMPETITION THAT ISN'T NEARLY AS GREAT AS IT IS FOR CREDIT METRES THEY ARE PAYING MORE THAN PEOPLE NEED TO PAY ON CREDIT METRES AND WE THINK THAT'S WRONG AND THAT'S THE REASON I PUT THAT WE'RE PUTTING A CAP ON THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE PROBLEM SHOULD GO AWAY WHEN THE START METER'S COME ON
THEN PEOPLE ON PREPAYMENT METERS SHOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS PEOPLE ON ON STAND CREDIT METERS THAT WON'T START TO THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SO FOR THOSE ON PREPAYMENT METERS IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT DIFFERENCE IT'S GOING TO MAKE BY IMPOSING A CAT HOW MUCH THEY'RE BUILT A PICK UP WELL IT'S GOING TO REDUCE BILLS OVERALL BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR AND THAT EQUATES TO AROUND NINETY POUNDS FOR IT YOU HAVE YOUR CUSTOMER
EVERY YEAR SO QUITE A SIGNIFICANT TO SIGNIFICANT CHUNK
BUT THAT DECISION TO INTERVENE IN THIS WAY IN A MARKET THAT HAS BEEN THEORY BEEN FREELY OPERATING FOR SO LONG IS BECAUSE IT IS JUST HASN'T BEEN WORKING WELL THE PREPAYMENT MARKET IS NOT WORKING IN A DIFFERENT WAY FROM THE WAY THE CREDIT MARKET IS NOT WORKING SO THEY ARE TWO SEPARATE MARKETS THE PROBLEM WITH PRE PAYMENT IS THAT
THERE ARE TECHNICAL REASONS WE'VE GOT A SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED NOT FOR COMPETITION AND THOSE TECHNICAL REASONS WILL GO AWAY BUT IN THE MEANWHILE WE WE DECIDED TO PUT IN THE FIRST GAP WHICH AS I SAY WE'LL WE'LL SAVE
PEOPLE ON PREPAYMENT METERS OF WHOM THERE ARE FOUR MILLION AROUND SHE HAD REALLY O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO ONE OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS THIS MORNING WHICH IS THAT GEM SHOULD KEEP A DATABASE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE STANDARD RATE FOR THREE YEARS AND THE IDEA IS THAT AFTER THREE YEARS IT WILL BE OPENED UP AND THEY'RE THE THINKING BEHIND IT ONE PRESUMES HE'S THAT THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY LOOK WE CAN OFFER YOU A BETTER DEAL ABSOLUTELY AND
OF COURSE THERE WILL BE SAFEGUARDS FOR THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE BEING BOMBARDED THE JUNK MAIL WE'VE TALKED THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS A REALLY BOLD MOVE THAT WILL ALLOW SUPPLIERS TO GET TO THAT PART OF THE MARKET THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT THEY CAN SWITCH
BUT HOW DO YOU STOP IT BEING A SPAMMERS CHARTER HOW DO YOU STOP PEOPLE BEING BOMBARDED WITH MARKETING MATERIAL WHAT THEY'LL BE BOMBARDED WITH HIS OFFERS TO SAVE UP TO THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR NOT MARKETING MATERIAL WHAT WHAT THEY WILL GET HIS INFORMATION ABOUT
ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS AND WE CAN'T STOP SPAM GENERALLY BUT THIS IS NOT SPAM THIS IS TARGETED TARGETED NAILED IT WILL ONLY BE MALE WHICH WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO REALISE THE SAVINGS WHICH ARE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY DOING IS PUTTING OPENING UP PEOPLE'S NAMES AND ADDRESSES ISN'T THERE A DATA PROTECTION ISSUE THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN TO THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER AND HE IS HAPPY WITH WHAT WITH WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING WILL BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF OFTEN
IT WOULD BE THE SUPPLIERS ARE LICENSED IF THEY MISBEHAVE AFTER HIM CAN TAKE STEPS SO WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE BENEFITS OF THIS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE ENORMOUS BECAUSE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVEN'T CONSIDERED SWITCHING SUPPLIER WHEN YOU SET THAT AGAINST THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR THEY CAN SAVE THIS LOOKS TO US TO BE A SENSIBLE AND INDEED WORTHWHILE MEASURE
ONE OF THE OTHER PROPOSALS IS TO REVERSE THE CHANGE THAT WAS MADE TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF TARIFFS
WHAT YOU PRESUMABLY END UP WITH THEN IS AND RETURN BACK TO THE VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM WE USED TO HAVE A BEWILDERING TO LOOK AT THE ARRAY OF OFFERS AND WORK OUT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEANT
WELL WE'VE GOT PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES AND THEY'RE RATHER GOOD AT SORTING OUT WHICH THE BEST OFFERS ARE THERE ARE ALREADY THERE THIRTY SUPPLIERS OUT THERE THEY'VE EACH GOT FOUR TYRES SAYS TALK THEY'RE ALREADY QUITE A LOT OF OFFERS YOU NEED A GOOD SYSTEM TO ALLOW YOU TO FIND THE BEST OFFER AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE IT IS A BIT OF A JUNGLE OUT THERE BUT WE THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO GET BETTER AS PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES BECOME GET MORE INVOLVED IN THE MARKET THEY MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE ALREADY AND
STOPPING THE CAROL WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW THE PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES TO OFFER COMPETITIVE DEALS TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER GOOD DEALS AND WE THINK ALL THAT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS THESE CHANGES THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THEY WILL STOP ENERGY COMPANIES RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS
THEY WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND THE BEST DEALS AND THEY'RE OUR BEST THERE ARE GOOD DEALS OUT THERE AS AS WE'VE SAID AND AS WE SAID BEFORE THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT TOO MANY OF US ARE STILL SITTING ON EXPENSIVE DEALS WHEN WE DON'T NEED TO USE EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY GOOD DEALS AND THEN ACT UPON THAT INFORMATION AND SWITCH TO THEM ROGER WICKHAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIMES EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE POLLING COMPANY YOU GARV TELLS US THAT WOMEN OVER SIXTY WITHOUT A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE QUEEN OF COURSE FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY
THE SON'S CLAIM YESTERDAY THAT SHE WANTS US TO LEAVE BASED ON CONVERSATIONS REPORTED TO THE NEWSPAPER HAVE PROVOKED FURY THOUGH AND AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT FROM THE PALACE TO THE PRESS REGULATOR BUT TODAY'S SUN NEWSPAPER IS UNREPENTANT AND THE EDITOR TONY GALLAGHER TALK TO US JUST AN HOUR AGO AND WAS VERY MUCH STANDING BY STORY
MULTIPLE SOURCES TO SOURCES TO BE PRECISE CAME TO US WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUEEN AND HER VIEWS ON THE E.U. AND WE WOULD'VE BEEN DERELICT IN OUR DUTY IF WE DIDN'T PUT THEM IN THE PAPER IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT THE FACT THAT THE STORY'S INCONVENIENT FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS NOT MY FAULT WE SERVE OUR READERS AND NOT THE ELITES WHO MIGHT BE UPSET AT WHAT WE'VE WRITTEN
STEVE UNIT FROM RADIO FOUR'S A MEDIA SHOW HIS HAIR A TRICKY ONE FOR THE INDEPENDENT PRESQUE STANDARDS ORGANISATION ISN'T IT STEVE BECAUSE WELL I HAVE A MINUTE THEY'VE GOT TO TRY TO ESTABLISH FACT IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT WELL UP TO A POINT I THINK YOU'RE A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THE ROYAL POSITION IS THAT THEY NEVER COMMENT ON THE QUEEN'S BRIGHTON CONVERSATIONS THAT'S THEIR PROTOCOL AND THEY SAY THAT'S BECAUSE
I'VE MET LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO'VE MET THE QUEEN AND THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT SHE'S A DOUGHTY INTERROGATOR SHE'S NO SHE'S NO SPRING CHICKEN SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT SHE'S QUITE LIVELY SHE HAS LOTS OF QUESTIONS VIEWS AND OPINIONS AND IT'S ALWAYS QUITE EXCITING SO BUT THEY NEVER COMMENT ON THEM BECAUSE TO DO SO IN THEIR VIEW INTO
RUNS THE RISK OF INTRODUCING HER TO PUBLIC CONTROVERSY IN A WAY WHICH IS SIMPLY NOT APPROPRIATE GIVEN HER CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION AS THE MONARCH ECCENTRICS AT RECEPTION SO THAT'S THEIR POSITION TO THAT EXTENT THE COMPLAINT THEY HAVE MADE THEREFORE HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE STORY I SEE DID SHE OR DID SHE NOT SAY WHAT THE SUN'S REPORTED THAT SHE SAID BECAUSE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO
A COMMENT ON A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WHICH BY DEFINITION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE I THINK THERE'S NO REASON ON EARTH WHY THE SUN SHOULD RESPECT ANY OF THAT THERE ARE NEWSPAPER WHERE THE PUBLIC THEY THINK IT'S THEIR JOB TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON AND IN ONCE AND SHE MAY SAY ALL CREDIT IN THE PUB SO THE COMPLAINT IS WHAT THE COMPLAINT IS UNDER SECTION ONE OF THE EDITORS' CODE WHICH SAYS AND I'LL QUOTE YOU THE PRESS MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO PUBLISH INACCURATE MISLEADING OR DISTORTED INFORMATION OR IMAGES INCLUDING THIS IS THE CRITICAL BIT HEADLINES NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT
THERE THERE WHAT THEY WILL HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT IS WHETHER THE STORY AT THE TEXT AS REPORTED THE THINGS THE QUEEN IS ALLEGED TO HAVE SAID EVEN ASSUMING SHE SAID THEM DOES THAT AMOUNT TO QUEEN BACKS BRECK'S IT GIVEN AND I MEAN I THINK SARAH POINT THIS OUT IN HER INTERVIEW WITH TONY GALLAGHER GIVEN THAT THIS CONVERSATION THE MAID THE PRINCIPAL CONVERSATION BECAUSE IN TWENTY ELEVEN
OF COURSE TO BE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTING EXIT FROM THE E.U. BACK THEN OF COURSE AND IT'S IT'S HER COURSE IT WAS AN ISSUE BUT THE TERM BRECK'S IT HADN'T EVEN BEEN HERE'S WHERE IT GETS VERY MUDDY THERE STAY BECAUSE IT DID IF EVEN IF IT IS JUST ABOUT THAT WHEN TONY GOING TO TALK TO SARAH AN SO AGO HE SUGGESTED THAT WAS PERHAPS OTHER INFORMATION THAT THEY ALSO HAD THE SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT ACTUALLY IT WAS PERFECTLY DEFENSIBLE TO HAVE THAT
HEADLINE AND IN ESTABLISHING THE FACTS OF THAT AM AND I WELL WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I TELL YOU NOBODY AT THE WELL OF THE ONE FOR YOU ONE FOR YOU WILL NOT FIND THIS ARTICLE IS THE QUEEN REPORTEDLY SAYING AT ANY POINT BRECK'S IT YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF THINGS IN THERE EVEN IF THEY'RE ALL TRUE LOOKED AT THE FIRST OF THE BIG ONE THE E.U. IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SHE SETS O.K. THAT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE COULD EASILY BE FOLLOWED BY SO BRECHT'S IT
AW SO LET'S SAY THAT IT'S JUST GONNA BE A MATTER OF OPINION ON WHETHER YOU'VE GOT THE HEADLINE I DON'T IT'S NOT NO IT'S NOT IT'S GOING TO BE THE QUESTION'S GOING TO BE IF THE SUN HAS MORE AND TONY GUY SAID WE'VE ONLY PUBLISHED A FRACTION OF WHAT WE HAVE OR FAIR ENOUGH AS THE INVESTIGATION UNFOLDS WHAT THEY WILL BE IN A POSITION TO DISCOVER IS WHETHER THE SUN HAD ANY MORE THAN THEY HAVE PUBLISHED IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THE HEADLINE SO SO I DON'T THINK IT IS IT'S NOT A KIND OF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANONYMOUS SOURCES VERSE ANONYMOUS SOURCES HOW DOES IT DECIDE
IT'S GOING TO BE DO IT DOES WHATEVER THE SON HAS JUSTIFY THIS HEADLINE AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S NOT IT ACTUALLY FOOLS ERROL IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME AND THAT WAS ANOTHER CRITICAL QUESTION HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE BECAUSE IT'S NOT I THINK THE BEST GUESS FROM THE BEST GUESS I CAN GET A HANDLE ON IS AROUND TWO MONTHS OR SLIGHTLY LONGER OR
WHERE DOES THAT LEAD YOU TO I CAN TELL YOU IT'S AROUND THE MIDDLE OF MAY YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS DON'T YOU DING DONG A STEVIE AT IT THANKS YOU HOOKER IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT
WELL PERHAPS NOT THESE GIVEN THAT LAST DISCUSSIONS UM PEOPLE SAY BRUSSELS HAS GOT ITS HANDS ON EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES FROM BORDERS TO BANANAS IN THE WEEKS RUNNING UP TO THE REFERENDUM WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH EVERYDAY OBJECTS ARE INDEED AFFECTED OR NOT THROUGH OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TODAY OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE AND SOMETIME BUSINESS EDITOR PRESENTER RATHER TAKES A LOOK AT THE CLOCK
THANKS TO GREENWICH MEAN TIME
WE'VE BEEN TELLING THE WORLD WENT TO SET THEIR WATCHES SINCE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BUT NOW THE CLOCK OR AT LEAST A WORKING HOURS HAVE TAKEN ON A DISTINCTLY EUROPEAN FEEL
IT SOUNDS HARMLESS ENOUGH TO PROTECT WORKERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY WORKING HOURS MUST MAKE MINIMUM STANDARDS APPLICABLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR UNTIL YOU GIVE IT A NINE
WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE IT'S BEEN THE BUGBEAR OF EURO SCEPTICS FOR YEARS WHEN EXCISE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN'T WORK MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK ON AVERAGE THAT SIMON FENTON AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER AND PARTNER AT IRWIN MITCHELL SOLICITORS PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO ELEVEN HOURS REST A DAY TWENTY EIGHT DAYS OR FIVE POINT SIX WEEKS' HOLIDAY
BOTH OF THE DIRECTIVE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL WORTHLESS THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE SAYS ON THE RULES THAT AFFECTS HER PRIVATE OF VEHICLES THAT CARRY GOODS OR PASSENGER
THE MAXIMUM DAILY DRIVING TIME IS NINE HOURS BUT THE MAXIMUM DAILY DRIVING TIME CAN BE INCREASED TO TEN HOURS TWICE A WEEK AND THE MAXIMUM WEEKLY DRIVING LIMIT IS FIFTY SIX HOURS IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE U.S. AND CANADA IT'S SEVENTY HOURS A WEEK
BUT ALSO HERE IN EUROPE THE MAXIMUM DRIVING TIME OVER ANY TWO WEEKLY PERIOD IS NINETY HOURS SO IF YOU DO DRIVE FIFTY SIX HOURS IN ONE WEEK YOU CAN ONLY DRIVE THIRTY FOUR HOURS THE FOLLOWING WEEK I DID HOPE YOU'RE KEEPING UP TILL AFTER HER DRIVING PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN FOUR AND A HALF HOURS A DRIVER MUST AND OTHER WORDS HAS WON BRITISH TRANSPORT MANAGER TOLD ME IT'S COMPLEX HE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WAY THE RULES ARE ENFORCED IN THE U.K. IF YOU'RE INTO ITALY OR ROMANIA HE SAID
THEY'RE MORE LIKE COLLARED BY ANOTHER BREAK OF AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES WORKING TIME REGULATIONS CAME INTO FORCE IN THIS COUNTRY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND BEFORE THAT THERE WERE NO RULES ABOUT MINIMUM HOLIDAY ENTITLEMENT CONSIDER THIS THE CLIENT CAME IN AND ASKED ME HOW MUCH HOLIDAY HE HAD TO GIVE HIS WIFE IT WAS THIS WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX
WHEN THEY'RE ONLY TWENTY YEARS AGO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE THEM ANY HOLIDAY SO HE INSTRUCTED ME TO WRIGHT'S CONTRACTS OR PLAYING WHICH INCLUDED NO HOLIDAY
EVER SINCE WE ADOPTED THE DIRECTIVE AND WROTE OUR OWN MORSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COMPLY WITH IT THE PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES WORKING MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK HAS FORM
EACH WEEK ROAD TRANSPORT DRIVERS LIKE THE DRIVER OF THE BUS THAT I'M ON AT THE MOMENT WORK FIVE AND A HALF HOURS LESS THAN THEY USED TO
BUT TEN PER CENT ARE STILL WORKING MORE THAN FIFTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK
UNION SAY THAT'S ILLEGAL AND ARE STILL THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS THAT THE U.K. IS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S BEST ENFORCES THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE
IN ALL TWENTY TWO E.U. COUNTRIES BREACH
YOU CLOCK WATCHING DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL JOBS IN SOME SECTORS SUITS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS NEED FLEXIBILITY AND MOST WORKERS CAN ALSO OPT OUT OF THE FORTY EIGHT HOURS LIMIT TO THE WORKING WEEK IF THEY CHOOSE AT FIRST THAT WAS JUST IN THE U.K. BUT NOW TO FIFTEEN OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO ALLOW THEIR WORKERS TO OPT OUT IT'S A SIGN THAT FEW IN THE E.U. THINK THE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE IS WELL IT'S WORKING
THEY'VE TRIED TO REWRITE IT BUT THAT'S BEEN HELD BACK BY TWENTY EIGHT COUNTRIES AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BICKERING OVER WATER REWRITE SHOULD LOOK LIKE IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE DISHARMONY THAT CAN CREEP INTO THE Y.

C. AND VERY SPECTACULARLY IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM IN MEXICO GUATEMALA BELIZE ON DURING EL SALVADOR LATER SUFFERING UNDER THE SPANISH ARRIVED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
THE MAYA WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR ASTROLOGICAL INGENUITY FOR THEIR WRITING A TREMENDOUS ENGINEERING SKILLS ON THEIR GREAT STONE CITIES BUT NEW AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IS REVEALING MANY MORE CITIES WAS EVER BEFORE IMAGINED WHEN THE SPANISH GAME AT A CORTEZ AND DE CORDOBA THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM SO MANY DISEASES THAT THEY RADICALLY REDUCE THE MAYA POPULATION AND ALTHOUGH THE MY CONTINUE TO PRESERVE MUCH OF THEIR CULTURE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE SPANISH AS CATASTROPHIC MEANWHILE NEW RESEARCH IS UNCOVERING NEW TREASURES EMERY BURIED DEEP
BENEATH THE CAMOUFLAGE OF A RAMPAGING JUNGLE THAT'S A MAYA CIVILISATION WITH ELIZABETH GRAND MATTHEW RESTFUL AND BENJAMIN DISH AT NINE OH TWO BACK TO TODAY THAN THANKS THE WEATHER MUCH OF ENGLAND AND WALES IS GOING TO BE CLOUDY THERE'LL BE SOME ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE ESPECIALLY ON THE HILLS
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM ZEB SENDS THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG SAYS THE ENERGY REGULATOR OFGEM SHOULD KEEP A DATABASE OF CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON STANDARD TARIFFS FOR A WHILE SO COMPETITORS CAN APPROACH THEM WITH BETTER DEALS IT'S ALSO RECOMMENDING AN ENERGY PRICE CAP FOR FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON PREPAYMENT METERS
ROGER WHITCOMBE WHO'S BEEN OVERSEEING THE COMPETITION AND MARKET AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATION TOLD AS THE CAMP WOULD REDUCE BILLS OVERAWED BY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR WHICH MEANT AN ANNUAL SAVING OF AROUND NINETY FOR DUAL FUEL CUSTOMERS
DAVID CAMERON IS TO SET OUT THE REASONS WHY HE BELIEVES BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WILL ALSO ACCUSED THOSE CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE OF SEEING THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS AND BUSINESSES AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE MEANWHILE THE CABINET MINISTER CHRIS GRAYLING WILL USE HER SPEECH IN LONDON TO CRITICISE MY CAMERON'S RENEGOTIATION DEAL
THE EDITOR OF THE SUN HAS DEFENDED THE NEWSPAPERS CLAIMED THAT THE QUEEN IS KEEN FOR A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE E.U. WAS TO TONY GALLAGHER SAID THE ARTICLE WAS BASED ON INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
THE LATEST STRIKE BY JUNIOR DOCTORS IS ENTERING A SECOND DAY N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS WARNED THAT HOSPITALS COULD FACE A BACKLOG BECAUSE OF DELAYS IN DISCHARGING PATIENTS THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE WHEN SHOULD A PERSON BIG GRANTED LEGAL AID THEY HAVE TO BE SOME LIMITS MOST PEOPLE WOULD ACCEPT THAT BUT THE LEADER OF THE GREEN PARTY NATALIE BENNETT IS CALLING ON THE PRIME MINISTER TO INTERVENE AND OVERTURN HER DECISION TO DENIED LEGAL AID
IN THE CASE OF SEVEN YEAR OLDS ZONE BANG BOWLER HE DIED DURING FLOODS TWO YEARS AGO TEXT TESTS SUGGESTED THAT HE'D DIED OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING BUT HIS PARENTS BELIEVE HE WAS ACTUALLY KILLED BY HYDROGEN CYANIDE FROM A LANDFILL SITE THERE IS AN INQUEST DUE
BUT NO LEGAL AID FOR HIS PARENTS TO BE REPRESENTED AND HIS PARENTS CHI NICOLE THEN BOWLER ARE BOTH HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
CARBON BELLA FIRST OF ALL WHY IN THIS CASE IS IT IMPORTANT IN YOUR VIEW THAT YOU GET LEGAL AID WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO
MORNING IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECEIVE LEGAL AID SO THAT WE HAVE PARITY OF ARMS SIX FAIRNESS AND NOT HAVING LEGAL AID IS ANOTHER BLOW TO JUSTICE TO TRUTH AND TO OBTAINING ANSWERS
SO THE SITUATION WE ARE IN REALLY MAKES US WEEP AT THE INJUSTICE THAT BROKEN PARENTS SHOULD BE LEFT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES REPRESENT THEMSELVES
IN A SIX WEEK HEARING OF THEIR OWN SON'S INQUEST AGAINST FIVE OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP QUEEN'S COUNSEL THEIR BARRISTERS AND JUNIOR BARRISTERS ET-CETERA AND THAT'S THE POINT NICOLE THAT THE PUBLIC BODY IS THAT YOU HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THOSE PUBLIC BODIES
ARE REPRESENTED VERY PROFESSIONAL ABSOLUTELY WITH QUEEN'S COUNSEL THERE'S OVER SIXTY WITNESSES TO QUESTION AND THERE WERE NUMEROUS BUNDLES AMOUNTING TO TWENTY SOMETHING NIGHT AND WE
TO PERSONALLY REPRESENT OURSELVES IN THE CURRENT POSITION QUESTION IN THOSE WITNESSES REGION OUT STATEMENTS ALREADY THERE'S BEEN SIX PRE INQUEST HEARINGS WHERE THERE'S BEEN COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT LEGAL ARGUMENTS WHICH
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'M GOING THE COURTS ARE OBVIOUSLY WERE GIVEN COUNSELLOR AFTERWARDS BUT IT MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO JUNE SAME JUSTICE SO ON THE POINT OF THE LEGAL EH
THE OTHER AGENCIES FIVE ARE FUNDED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THE OTHER FIVE QUEEN'S COUNSEL WE WHOSE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS ARE LEFT DEFENCELESS
AND THAT IS TANTAMOUNT TO HER HAVING US AGAINST FIVE LIVES AND THAT'S NOT COMPASSIONATE THAT DOESN'T FEEL AT ALL RIGHT IN TERMS OF GOOD JUSTICE AND THERE'S A WIDER POINT ISN'T THERE AS WELL NICOLE THAT AS WELL AS OBVIOUSLY WANTING TO GET TO THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SON AND EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS GOING TO BE TO BASICALLY
THERE IS A KIND OF PUBLIC INTEREST AS WELL IN IN THAT THE CASE THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE AT THE INQUEST IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE ABOUT THE THREATS THAT MAY EXIST IN LANDFILL SITES ABSOLUTELY
THERE IS A TICKING TIME BOMB WE PURCHASED THE PROPERTY DOING ALL OF THIS SEARCH IS A PRUDENT BUY WOULD DO AND IT NEVER REVEALED THAT THERE WAS A LANDFILL SITE SINCE THEN
IT IS IT'S COME TO LIGHT THAT THAT PROPERTY THAT AREA IS LANDFILL AND WHEN THE FLOODING CAME YOU HAVE THIS TOXIC COMBINATION
AND IT WILL LOOK KINDLY COVERED IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME IN AND TALK TO US REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU LET'S LET'S TURN IF YOU'D JUST STAY ON THE LAND THERE'S TENDERED CLIVE COLEMAN LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT BECAUSE AND PEOPLE WILL WONDER CLIVE WHY IT IS IN THIS CASE AND IN SIMILAR CASES WHY LEGAL AID ISN'T GRANT
I THINK THEY WILL I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY SURPRISED AND OBVIOUSLY VERY MOVED BY WHAT THEY'VE JUST HEARD LET ME JUST OUTLINED THE POSITION THERE IS LEGAL AID FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE DECEASED COVERING ALL OF THE PREPARATORY WORK ASSOCIATED WITH AN INQUEST NOT THAT CAN INCLUDE PREPARING WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TO THE CORONER BUT THAT'S MEANS AND MERITS TESTED BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS FUNDING FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION AT THE INQUEST ITSELF IS NOT GENERAL THEY AVAILABLE AND THAT'S BECAUSE
SO THE GOVERNMENT AN INQUEST IS A RELATIVELY INFORMAL INQUISITOR ORIEL PROCESS IT ISN'T A TRIAL IT'S SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED SAY THE GOVERNMENT SO PEOPLE WITHOUT LEGAL KNOWLEDGE CAN EASILY PARTICIPATE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE JUST HEARD THAT SOME OF THE FAMILIES INVOLVED DON'T ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS IT I THINK THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE NEEDING TO A SIMILAR
AND I THINK THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF CONCERN AMONGST LAWYERS WHO WORK IN THIS AREA OF THE LAW THAT THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE A VERY MARKED IMBALANCE OF ARMS THERE IS SOMETHING KNOWN AS EXCEPTIONAL FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES IN SOME CASES THERE ONLY TWO GROUNDS FORGETTING THAT THE FIRST IS IF IT'S REQUIRED BY ARTICLE TWO OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WHERE THE STATE MAY HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE OR TAKING IT WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION SO CASES LIKE POLICE SHOOTINGS DEATHS IN CUSTODY
THE SECOND AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT IS APPLICABLE IN INQUEST SUCH AS THAT INTO ZONES DEATH IS WHERE THERE'S DEEM TO BE A WIDER PUBLIC INTEREST KNOWS THAT'S WHERE IT'S DEEMED THAT PROVIDING AN ADVOCATE IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO A CLASS OF PEOPLE
OH ONLY DIRECT FAMILY MEMBERS SO IT'S A WET MAY HELP TO IDENTIFY DANGEROUS PRACTICES OR SYSTEMIC FAILINGS THAT COULD ENDANGER OTHER LIVES BUT IT'S IT'S A PRETTY HIGH BAR IT HAS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST THAT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF FACTORS BUT IT WON'T BE SEEM TO BE SIGNIFICANT IF IT BENEFITS FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT THE BAR IS SET THAT HIGH OH KATE WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE THE CLIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND KIND NICOLE AS WELL
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU AND WILL OBVIOUSLY STAY IN TOUCH AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME IS
IT'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE THE COMP COMBINED CADET FORCE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OPERATING MAINLY IN PRIVATE SCORES NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS KEEN FOR THE MILITARY THEMED YOUTH ORGANISATION TO GET INTO LESS AFFLUENT AREAS IN SUMMER BUDGET LAST YEAR GEORGE OSBORNE PROMISED EXTRA MONEY TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY THE NUMBER OF CADET UNITS IN STATE SCHOOLS HE SUGGESTED FIVE FOLD BY TWENTY TWENTY
IT'S B.B.C. SCHOOL REPORT DAY TODAY AND ONE YOUNG SCHOOL REPORTER IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR HIS SCHOOL MY TAG WHAT THE CON MAN CANNOT DO DUE CAUSE ACADEMY NOTTINGHAMSHIRE'S PRACTISING IT DRILLS
HELLO MY NAME'S AARON AND I'M TWELVE I'VE COME ALONG TO WATCH BECAUSE MY SCHOOL SIGN COMMUNITY ACADEMY STARTING THE CON CADET FORCE A SHARE BUT SHOULD
THAT'S WHERE HIS UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OBVIOUSLY YOU GET TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS WERE DESCENTS ARE YOU LEARNING MILITARY SKILLS GOING ON TO JOIN THE ARMY BECAUSE PERSONALLY I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY ONLY THING THAT I COULD DO WHY SHOULD I JOIN THE CAN AS IT BOOSTS YOUR CONFIDENCE ALL OF IT YOU GET TO LEARN NEW SKILLS BUILD A BOND WITH OTHER PEOPLE TAKE CONTROL YOU
MAGAZINE OF TEN ROUNDS WHY WOULD I'VE COME INSIDE TO THE CADET MAY STELLA LOOK AT HOW THE CADETS ARE GETTING ON WITH THEIR CLOSELY SUPERVISED SUIT SO TIME GO ON
A G.P. RIFLE WHICH IS LIKE WHAT THE ADULTS USE IN AFGHANISTAN AND I LAUGH I THINK THAT'S ONE REASON
I'M IN THE CANTEEN OR SOWN COMMUNITY ACADEMY AND THE CON MAN CADET FORCE REDS SHOW THE YEAR NINES WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT MY NOSE CAN MAN I'M A TRAINING OFFICER WITH SEVENTH INFANTRY BASE DOWN IN NOTTINGHAM I HELP ROLL OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WHEN GETTING INVOLVED WITH BY SCHOOL WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THOSE AREAS
THERE'S MAYBE A LEVEL OF GREATER SOCIAL DEPRIVATION MAY BE DUE TO DECLINING LOCAL INDUSTRIES WE ARE LOOKING AT INDICATORS WERE IN SCHOOLS SUCH AS FREE SCHOOL MEALS RACIAL ETHNIC DIVERSITY AND SO RATHER THAN WHITE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE TRADITIONALLY LOOKING AT WE WANT TO BROADEN IT OUT A LOT MORE TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE SO THIS IS NOT AN ARMY RECRUITMENT DRIVE
IT'S A MILITARY THEMED YOUTH ORGANISATION IF AN INDIVIDUAL THINGS I REALLY ENJOYED MY TIME IN THE CADET FORCES I'M ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT JOINING ONE OF THE ARMED SERVICES WE ARE THERE TO HELP THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT WE ARE NOT RECRUITS
THE GOVERNMENT WANTS CADET FORCE OOH FIVE HUNDRED STATE SCHOOL BY TWENTY TWENTY MY PRINCIPAL MISTER CROFT IS KEEN OUR SCHOOL IS ONE OF THEM HELLO HERE
I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE SENIORS MEMBERS OF STAFF ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MILITARY PART PEOPLE JUST SEE THE UNIFORM AND OUTSIDERS MIGHT LOOK AT THAT AND THINK THAT SORTS AND COMMUNITY ACADEMY ATTEMPTING TO GET THEIR STUDENTS TO GO INTO THE MILITARY WHERE HE'S ACTUALLY I JUST TOTALLY BELIEVE IN ALL OF THE SKILLS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOP IN THE C. C. F. TEAMWORK RESILIENCE SELF CONFIDENCE WE'RE NOT TRAINING THEM UP TO JOIN THE ARMY WERE TRAINING THEM UP TO BE BETTER PEOPLE WHAT DO THE STUDENTS THINK OF THE CADET FORCE COMING TO THIS SCHOOL
REALLY FUN I GET TO USE STONES AND STUFF AND YOU GET TO GO AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD DON'T YOU
I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA BUT THERE'S A FATAL FLAW THAT IS THEIR WEAPONS TRAINING MAYBE JUST MAYBE THE STONE COULD KILL THEMSELVES O.K.
AT THE MOMENT COLETTE FORCE FOUND MAINLY IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS BUT WITH ITS FIFTY MILLION POUND INVESTMENT IN THE CADET EXPANSION INITIATIVE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO FOCUS ON THE DEPRIVED AREAS IN CLEVELAND THE DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSFORMATION WHICH ONE'S MY SCHOOL BILLY'S BEING INVOLVED IN THE CADETS WILL HELP US GUESS JOBS ON AVAIT DIFFICULTIES HIM VERY DEPRIVED AREAS OF ITS YOUNG PEOPLE
DO WE NOT SEE BEYOND THEIR OWN LITTLE COMMUNITY AND THIS IS A WAY OF SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF ALL MY DAD'S HAIR AT THE CAN GET EMPLOYED
I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE CON MIND COULD I THOUGHT I REALLY WANT TO DO I KNOW I WANTED TO JOIN THE ARMY NOW I SERIOUSLY THINK THIS IS OUR FROM SUN COMMUNITY ACADEMY REPORTING FOR B. B. C. NEW SCHOOL REPORT
I COULD RATE REPORTING THERE AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE A STORIES BY THE YOUNG REPORTERS FROM ALL OVER THE U.K. IF YOU GO TO THE B.B.C. NEWS SCHOOL REPORT WEBSITE IT'S A WEB PAGE TO DOCK AT U.K. FORWARD SLASH SCHOOL REPORT AND JUST A QUICK REMINDER AS WELL THIS WEEK'S EXPERIMENT WITH OUR NEWS HEADLINES AS AN ILLUSTRATED VERSION RUNNING ON THE WEBSITE NEWS ILLUSTRATED USES SOME ANIMATED VIDEO TO GIVE YOU THE HEADLINES IN A NEW WAY HAVE A LOOK B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U.K. FORWARD SLASH TODAY
TIME NOW IS QUARTER TO NINE THE COMPETITION AUTHORITY AS WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME TOLD US TODAY WHAT IT THINKS NEEDS TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE ELECTRICITY AND GAS THAT WE CONSUME CHEAPER OR AT LEAST AS CHEAP AS IT SHOULD BE AND WE'VE HAD IT DEFENDED BY THE PERSON WHO IS IN CHARGE AN INVESTIGATION BUT ALSO ATTACKED A BIT AS WELL FROM ONE OF THE SMALLER EDGED ENERGY COMPANIES LISA IS HERE HIS LABOURS
ENERGY AS SHADOW ENERGY SECRETARY AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THEY'VE COME UP WITH HIS TOOK THEM TWO YEARS TO COME UP WITH THIS IT TOOK THEM TWO YEARS AND THEY'VE CONFIRMED WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW THAT HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES ARE BEING OVERCHARGED FOR THE TUNE OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR BY THE ENERGY COMPANIES IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR STILL WHY SOME FAMILIES ARE BEING CHARGED HUNDREDS OF POUNDS MORE THAN OTHERS FOR EXACTLY THE SAME
PRODUCT AND ESSENTIALLY THE PROPOSALS THAT THE SEA OR MAY HAVE COME UP WITH DO NOTHING TO TACKLE THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE ENERGY MARKET WHICH A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN COMPETITION THEY PUT THE ONUS ON THE CUSTOMER TO SWITCH AND THEY LET ENERGY COMPANIES OFF THE HOOK WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS IDEA THAT ONE OF THE CENTRAL IDEAS WHICH IS THAT THERE IS A DATABASE OF PEOPLE THAT HAS THEM SHARED WITH OTHER COMPANIES SO THE COMPANY'S COMES
THAT CAN GO TO THOSE PEOPLE AND SAY HEY COME ON YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH YOU'VE COME TO ASK WHETHER IT REAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS COULD OPEN THE DOOR TO CUSTOMERS POTENTIALLY BEING BOMBARDED WITH NUISANCE CALLS SAY TOLD US BUT THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN WELL BEEN TO THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES AND HAD IT O.K. AID AND IT IT IT CAN WORK IN A WAY THAT IS ACCEPTED AND I THINK THAT THE ONUS IS NOW ON THE C.M.A. TO REASSURE PEOPLE THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM WITH THIS PROPOSAL AS THE MAJOR PROPOSAL TO IT TO EMERGE FROM THIS TWO YEAR
INQUIRY INTO A BROKEN ENERGY MARKET IS BUT IT DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE SYSTEM WHAT CUSTOMERS MOST NEED IS THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY SHOP AROUND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR AND WE NEED INCENTIVES SO THE COMPANY'S INSTEAD OF OVERCHARGING PEOPLE FOR THAT BASIC ENERGY NEEDS ARE ACTUALLY ADDING SOMETHING EXTRA
THAT WE'RE PAYING MORE FOR AGAIN THEN DO YOU SEE ALSO NOTHING TO CHANGE BUT THEY DO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO LEAD TO BILL'S COMING DOWN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE AVERAGE AMOUNT SAVED A DECENT ONE THEY SAY I LISTEN TO THE HEAD OR THE C.M.A. ENQUIRY ON YOUR PROGRAMME EARLIER AND YOU ASKED HIM HER VERY BASIC QUESTION WHICH IS WILL THIS STOP THE OVERCHARGING OF CUSTOMERS AND HE COULDN'T GIVE YOU A CLEAR ANSWER THAT YES IT WOULD
IN HER FOUR YEARS AGO THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THAT HE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF US WHO ARE BEING OVERCHARGED TO THE TUNE OF BILLIONS OF POUNDS A YEAR WOULD GO ON TO A CHEAPER TARIFF THAT WAS A PROMISE THAT HE MADE TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE NOW FOUR YEARS LATER WE'VE GOT A MAJOR ENQUIRY COMING UP WITH A PROPOSAL THAT DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THE BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE BROKEN ENERGY MARKET AND I THINK NOW THE ONUS IS ON MINISTERS TO DECIDE ARE THEY ON THE SIDE OF THE ENERGY COMPANIES OR ARE THEY ON THE SIDE OF CUSTOMERS PEACE AND ANDY THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE THE NUMBER OF TEENAGERS GETTING PREGNANT IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE RECORDS BEGAN THEIR FIGURES HAVE HALVED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE ALTHOUGH THE PICTURE IS VERY DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE HOME EDITOR IS MARK EASTERN AND MUM THINKS ARE EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE JUST BEHAVING BETTER I THINK WE BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS DID AT THEIR AGE THAT'S FOR SURE AND SOME GUESTS I SUSPECT THEY'RE BEHAVING BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS DO IT'S NOT JUST A TEENAGE PREGNANCIES YOU CAN LOOK RIGHT ACROSS THE SORT OF TEENAGE SORT OF CONCERNS OF SEX DRUGS BOOZE FAGS CRIME ALL OF THOSE WE'VE SEEN
BIG FALLS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE REASONS ONE I THINK THAT THE TEENAGE REBEL IS NOT WHAT NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE PERHAPS A DYING BREED THEY'RE TRYING TO REBEL AGAINST PARENTS WHO WITH THEM SHELVES WERE RATHER REBELLIOUS AND THIS IS A GENERATION THAT THAT ACTUALLY WORKS VERY VERY HARD THEY'RE MORE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING THEIR EXAMS THAN THEY ARE ABOUT GOING AND SORT OF TEARING UP THE WORLD AND ALSO THEIR PARENTS TEND TO HAPPEN LISTEN TO THE SAME KIND OF MUSIC AND WEAR THE SAME KIND OF CLOSES THEM SO IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT
A REBEL UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE'S MAYBE AN IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION BUT DO WE KNOW WHERE THE TEENAGERS ARE HAVING LESS SEX THAN THEY WERE IN PREVIOUS YEARS
I THINK MY GUESS IS THAT THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY ARE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WHAT MY GENERATION DID A HECK OF A LOT OF WAS HANGING AROUND WE'VE GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE AS QUICKLY AS WE COULD TO BE WITH OUR MATES AT THE AT THE BUS SHELTER WHERE SOMEBODY WOULD PRODUCE A PACKET OF TEN BEN HE'S IN A COUPLE OF PACKETS OF CIDER INDA AND YOU'D HOPE TO GET A QUICK SNOG
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S CHANGED BECAUSE NOW THOSE SAME TEENAGERS MY CHILDREN'S GENERATION THEY'RE UP IN THEIR BEDROOMS ON FACEBOOK OR ON ON COMPUTER GAMES SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GETTING THE SAME LEVEL OF INTERACTION WITH THEY DON'T HAVE TO SORT OF BE IN THE COLD AND MISCHIEF IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING THESE DAYS I GO LET ME BRING IN ALISON HADLEY WHO'S DIRECTOR OF THE TEENAGE PREGNANCY KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE OF BEDFORDSHIRE UNIVERSITY AND SHE LED THE TEENAGE PREGNANCY STRATEGY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING
IS IT FACEBOOK THE GETS THE CREDIT FOR HALVING TEENAGE PREGNANCY GOSH I WISH IT WAS THAT SIMPLE I THINK IT'S THE RESULT OF CONCERTED EFFORT FOR A LONG TERM EVIDENCE BASED PREVENTION PROGRAMME DOING WHAT SORT OF THINGS WELL I THINK THE AIM OF THE PRINCE'S TRUST SHE WAS READY TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE CHOICES BY GIVING THEM LOTS OF INFORMATION
THROUGH SEX AND RELATIONSHIPS EDUCATION ENCOURAGING PARENTS TO TALK MORE TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND SEXUAL HEALTH AND MAKING CONTRACEPTION ACCESS HAS MUCH MUCH EASIER AND THAT WAS DELIVERED THROUGH COUNCILS FOR HEALTH PARTNERS THROUGH CHARITIES THROUGH SCHOOL NURSES THAT'S WHAT THE PROGRAMME ABOUT WAS ABOUT IT WASN'T A STRATEGY THAT SAT ON A SHELF IT WAS A VERY VERY
ACTIVE STRATEGY PUT IN PLACE LOTS OF THINGS LOCALLY TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE BETTER CHOICES O.K. SO YOU WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS DIRECTED CENTRALLY EFFECT RATHER THAN YOU DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT JUST THE SOCIETAL CHANGES TAKEN THE CREDIT YOU CAN NEVER TELL WHAT THE SOCIETAL CHANGES IMPACT WILL BE BUT THE STAR SHE WAS AT THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGY FOR ENGLAND TO INTRODUCE SO I THINK
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT AN EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGY WILL GET THE RESULTS IF YOU STICK AT IT LONG ENOUGH THE SOCIAL ME YOU THINK I THINK IS ALL SPECULATION AT THE MOMENT BUT THE LEVELS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY AMONGST YOUNG PEOPLE SEEM TO BE SAME BROADLY THE SAME AND THAT'S INTERESTING SO THAT QUESTION I PUT TO MARGIE STERN ABOUT WHETHER TEENAGERS ARE HAVING LESS SEX YOU THINK THEY ARE STILL HAVING AS MUCH SEX WELL I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST SURVEY ACROSS THE U.K. HAVE SEXUAL ATTITUDES AND LIFESTYLES SHOWED NO CHANGE ACROSS THAT DECADES A TRAY JUST BETTER AT USING CONTRACEPTION
THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE YES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACK THE BEHAVIOUR OF INDIVIDUAL YOUNG PEOPLE BUT WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT'S OUR FOUND THAT WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE SAID SCHOOL WAS THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF SETS EDUCATION THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE PREGNANT BY EIGHTEEN AND ALL THE EVIDENCE WHICH HAS APPLIED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION BY UNESCO SAYS YOU NEED BETTER SEX EDUCATION EASY ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND THEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL MAKE THOSE CHOICES IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY NEW STORY ALISON HADLEY MARK EASTERN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THE ACTOR LAURENCE FOX WAS A MID FLOW ON STAGE THE OTHER NIGHT AS SHELVES TO GO WHEN HE REPORTEDLY SAID I WON'T BOTHER TELLING YOU THE STORY BECAUSE THIS CHAP IN THE FRONT ROW HAS RUINED IT FOR EVERYBODY HE DIDN'T USE THE WORD CHAP WHEN HE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU WANT TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
JUST STARTED HER CLICK MUTTERING IN HER KILLING EARLY ON DURING THE PLAY AND THEN
THE THING I TOLD HIM YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM A GENTLEMAN THEN LET'S PUT IT UP WHAT WE'VE GOT O.K. AND DID THE WHAT SEEMS STRANGE SAID IT WAS GOING ON FOR SO LONG BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE SEEN ON TWITTER THIS SUPPORT FOR YOU BUT YOU DID BASICALLY INTERRUPT THE PLATE DIDN'T YOU
O.K. SO WITH OR WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THIS SITUATION
OR SOMEBODY IN THE THEATRE SOME MEMBER OF THE THEATRE STUFF COULD AND I'VE GONE ALONG RATHER QUIETLY AND SAID EXCUSE ME SIR
WE'VE GOT AN EXPERIENCE IT'S A I'M BUILT FOR THAT OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE IT LOOKED AT SOME OF THE BOOTY AND BUNTING AT HIM OF COURSE THEY MAY BE THE NEXT SUITOR AUDIENCE MAY HAVE A CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO ME
LAURENCE MARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING AND TELLING US ABOUT IT BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF HECKLING THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT HERE ARE SOME WAYS THAT PEOPLE HAVE DEALT WITH IT OVER THE YEARS
TOLD YOU THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF L.G.B.T. AMERICANS
ALL THOSE LETTERS AND YOU'RE MY HOUSE
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A GOOD RESPONSE FROM ME BY INTERRUPTING ME LIKE THIS I'M SPENT A LONG TIME TRYING TO WORK VERY HARD ON THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
MAKE SURE IT'S ON TIME IT'S ON BUDGET ALL THE BUILDINGS BEING DONE BUT MOST IMPORTANT MOST IMPORTANT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
NO DID YOU WILL SEE THAT HEARTBREAKING STORY IN THE MIRROR NEWSPAPER LAST YEAR THEY RUN A CAMPAIGN
AFTER THE OTHER CHILDREN ARE YOU PRETENDING YOU CAN READ A IS THAT WHERE WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY MATT FORWARD HERE IS A STAND UP COMEDIAN AND BAG ON THE LINE BY CAROLINE CRAMPED IN HIS WEB EDITOR AT THE NEW STATESMAN GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IS IT LAURENCE FOX THING THERE THAT THEATRE ISN'T STAND UP IT'S NOT STAND UP BECAUSE ACTUALLY GIVEN YOUR JOB IT'S TO BE EXPECTED BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT TACTFULLY WHEN IT HAPPENS AND I WAS IN A FUNNY WAY AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T A COMEDIAN CAN'T LOSE THEIR RAG IN THE SAME WAY THAT MAX COULD YOU I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD HAVE APOLOGISED I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON AND I THINK
THE WORD USED TO DESCRIBE THE FELLA LAST NIGHT IT'S THEIR PLACE IS THAT OR ABSOLUTELY NOT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S THE HEIGHT OF ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR TO GO TO A SHOW AND TO BE SO RUDE NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLE ON STAGE BUT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE
IT WAS A BIT OF HANDLED WELL IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE I MEAN AND I SUPPOSE ACTUALLY LET ME BRING IN KAREN CRAMPED IT WAS POLITICALLY LISTENING TO TONY BLAIR BEING SLOW HANDCLAP THERE I MEAN THAT WAS A REMINDER WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THAT WAS YEAH THAT WAS THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE IN EVERY EIGHTY THOUSAND AND IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE HECKLES EVER BECAUSE IT'S SO POLITE BUT ABSOLUTELY ACHIEVED ITS PURPOSE WHICH WAS THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE WAS SAYING THEY WANTED HIM TO STOP
BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT POLITICIANS HAVE TO DEAL WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THEY CAN EITHER AS A PRESIDENT OBAMA DO THEIR SORT OF MAKE A JOKE OF IT AND KIND OF KEEP THE AUTHORITY OR THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE HEKLA RON BUT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THE CHARACTER OF POLITICIAN THEY CAN'T DO WHAT LAURENCE FOX DIDN'T KIND OF COME OUT SPEAKERS THE AS THAT ACTOR RATHER THAN THE CHARACTER
IT'S INTERESTING I SUPPOSE THAT WHAT MATT FORD FROM YOU'VE GOT TO JUDGE WHOSE SIDE THE AUDIENCE IS ON AND HANDLE THAT YOU HAVE AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE THE HECKLER DEPENDS FILM THE TONE OF THE WORST THING ACTUALLY ISN'T SO MUCH HECKLING IT'S JUST PEOPLE BEING PEOPLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE JUST BEING ANTI SOCIAL IN GENERAL PEOPLE LOOKING AT THEIR PHONES AND WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT THE FRONT IN COMEDY BUT THEY DON'T REALISE IS THEY'RE SAT IN THE DARK AND THEN THEY ILLUMINATE THEIR FACE WITH A SORT OF MOVE FOOTLIGHT
AND ARE OF YOU SAY YOU WANT YOUR PHONE AND THEIR FACES IT LIT UP FOR EVERYONE TO SAY AND THEN THEY SORT OF DIDN'T EITHER ON THE PHONE IT'S WHEN YOU'RE ON STAGE AS WELL I THINK WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALISE IS WHEN YOU SENTENCE A VERY MUCH HEIGHTENED YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING LIKE THE RUSTLE OF A CRISP PACKET SOUNDS LIKE
A HUGE AND I COULD DOOR SLAMMING IT'S INCREDIBLE SO LAURENCE WILL HAVE BEEN ON STAGE JUST LIKE I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY AWARE ACUTELY AWARE OF EVERYTHING AND HOW DISTRACTING IS OFTEN PEOPLE SAT BEHIND THE NECK LOOK AREN'T THEY RIPPED THE DIRECTION OF THE NOISE
AND REALLY IT'S A JOB FOR THE NEW SNEAKERS A QUOTE THAT GUY BACK TO BE AT THIS WE ARE DAYS LATER THAT THE EXAMS OH ABSOLUTELY IT'S JUST SOMETIMES AND YOU WANT YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK IS THAT A PROBLEM WITH DEALING WITH OR DO I JUST CARRY ON AND THEN IF IT PERSISTS AND NO ONE ELSE'S CHALLENGE THEM WHEN YOU SORT OF HAVE TO TAKE IT ON AND WITH COMEDY OBVIOUSLY SO MUCH OF IT RELIES ON CONFIDENCE RIGHT MANJIT'S HAVE TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE AND IN DAD AND IN POLITICS CAROLINE WHERE IT CAN I SUPPOSE IT COULD WORK IN YOUR FAVOUR DEPENDING HOW YOU RESPOND
YES AND THERE'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HILLARY CLINTON DOING IT ON THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY CAMPAIGN TRAIL WELL SOMEONE KEPT SHOUTING IRON MY SHIRT AT HER AND EVEN HAD A PLACARD AND SHE ACTUALLY USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT SEXISM AND POLITICS
YOU SAY SHE WAS GOING TO SAY WELL PERHAPS IF SHE HAD NINE ON HER SHE WOULD HAVE DONE BUT SHE KIND OF SAID ACTUALLY THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY I'M HERE AND WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR ME SO YOU CAN TAKE IT ON AND A KIND OF SERIOUS POLICY SENSE IF YOU SAID IF YOU FEEL AS YOU SAY THE IS UP FOR THAT O.K. WELL I'M GOING TO HECKLE YOU BOTH OFFSTAGE CAROLINE AND MATT FORDE THANK YOU BOTH THE MAYA CIVILISATION OR CENTRAL AMERICA COMING UP NEXT BUT THAT'S IT FROM US TOM BATEMAN DOWN KELLY WERE EDITORS FROM CEREMONY GOOD MORNING
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK THE LONG AWAITED REPORT BY THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG ON THE FUTURE OF THE ENERGY INDUSTRY IS OUTLINED MEASURES DESIGNED TO CAN'T GAS AND ELECTRICITY BILLS THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY SAYS THOSE WHO STAY ON STANDARD TARIFFS FOR THREE YEARS SHOULD BE OFFERED INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO SWITCH SUPPLIES
IT'S ALSO RECOMMENDING A TEMPORARY PRICE CAP FOR FOUR MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON PREPAYMENT METERS ROGER WHITCOMBE WHO CHAIRED THE C.M.A. ZE INQUIRY TOLD US THAT LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS HAD SUFFERED AND THEY WOULD BE PROTECTED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY WHEN SMART METERS WERE INTRODUCED
COMPETITION THAT ISN'T NEARLY AS GREAT AS IT IS FOR CREDIT METRES THEY ARE PAYING MORE THAN PEOPLE NEED TO PAY ON CREDIT METRES AND WE THINK THAT'S WRONG AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE PUTTING A CAP ON IT'S GOING TO REDUCE BILLS OVERALL BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR AND THAT EQUATES TO AROUND NINETY POUNDS FOR A DUAL FUEL CUSTOMER EVERY YEAR
