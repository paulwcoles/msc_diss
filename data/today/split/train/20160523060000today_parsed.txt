OH CALLUM MAY REPORTING THERE AT SIX MINUTES PAST SIX IT'S TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST AND JAY WYNNE HAS IT THIS MORNING HELLO JAY THANKS ERIC MORNING AND IT'S A DRY START TO THE DAY IT'S A BRIGHT START FOR MANY OF US SOME SPELLS OF SUNSHINE ALTHOUGH IN THE FAR NORTH WEST OF THE U.K. THERE ARE SOME THICKER CLOUD AND THE ODD SPOT OF RAIN AS YOU'LL FIND IN THE FAR SOUTH AND EAST BUT MANY PLACES DOESN'T IT
ON A DRY NOTE AND A BRIGHT NOTE AND ALSO STILL SEE SOME SPELLS OF SUNSHINE INTO THE AFTERNOON BUT IT'S IN MOST INLAND AREAS WHERE WE ARE LIKE TO SEE SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPING THROUGH THE DAY TODAY SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS COULD WELL BE ON THE HEAVY SIDE
SOME HAIL THUNDER LIGHTNING CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BUT AROUND THE EASTERN COAST OF ENGLAND A BIT OF A BREEZE DEVELOPING FROM THE NORTH NORTH EAST AND LITTLE TEMPER THOSE TEMPERATURES SOMEWHAT SO IT'S ONLY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN DEGREES IN THE NEWCASTLE AT LEAST THAT SHOULD BE FINE AND DRY FOR MANY EASTERN COASTAL AREAS IT'S THOSE INLAND AREAS WHERE THE SHOWERS I LIKE TO DEVELOP AND SOME OF THOSE I SAY COULD WELL BE QUITE HEAVY
MUCH LIGHTER WINDS OF THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE U.K. AND NOT TOO MANY SHOWERS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND SWALES IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND SO A PRETTY DECENT SORT OF DAY HERE SUNNY SPELLS AND TEMPERATURES UP TO AROUND ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES IN SCOTLAND THERE WILL BE SOME SHOWERS BREAKING OUT THOSE INLAND AREAS SOME OF THOSE AGAIN WILL BE QUITE HEAVY BUT AROUND THE COAST IT'S LARGELY FINE AND DRY WITH A BIT OF SUNSHINE IN GLASGOW I'LL GET AROUND ABOUT SEVENTEEN DEGREES

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JAY IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE HEADLINES ARE MAINLY ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S WARNING THE TREASURY WARNING ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY WOULD BE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF BRECHT'S IT INTERESTING STORY IN THE MAIL THOUGH AN EXCLUSIVE FOR THEM CAMERON'S GURU IT SAYS WHY WE MUST QUIT THE E.U. THERE IS THE WORD YOU HAD IN THE NEWS BULLETIN OF STEVE HILTON A LONG PIECE IN THE CENTRE OF THE PAPER
HOW THE E.U. MAKES BRITAIN IMPOSSIBLE TO GOVERN IS THERE'S A HEADLINE THEY PUT ON HIS PIECE MY VIEW WRITES MY HILTON WHO OF COURSE USED TO BE DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST FRIEND AND ADVISOR IN POLITICS MY VIEW HE SAYS BASED ON A PRAGMATIC NON IDEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE E.U. OPERATES IS THAT AS LONG AS WE ARE MEMBERS
A COUNTRY CANNOT BE ROTTEN MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. MAKES BRITAIN LITERALLY UNGOVERNABLE IN THE SENSE THAT NO ADMINISTRATION ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE CAN GOVERN THE COUNTRY A DEMOCRACY GOES ON IS BASED ON THE NOTION THAT THE PEOPLE OF A DIRECTLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ARE ABLE TO DECIDE ISSUES FOR THEMSELVES AND GET MEMBERSHIP OF THE BRINGS WITH IT CONSTRAINTS ON EVERYTHING FROM EMPLOYMENT LAWS OF FAMILY LAW
ALL DETERMINED THROUGH DISTANT CENTRALISE PROCESSES WE HARDLY UNDERSTAND LET ALONE CONTROL WHILE HE WAS KNOWN FOR RATHER EXPLOSIVE RELATIONS INSIDE NUMBER TEN NEVER PREVIOUSLY WERE DAVID CAMERON I SUSPECT HE MAY BE CHOKING ON HIS BREAKFAST CEREAL THIS MORNING THE DAILY MIRROR DOESN'T UNUSUAL FOR GIVEN
THE POPE'S DEAD DOESN'T LEAD ON AN E. YOU REFERENDUM STORY IT'S HEADLINE LOW FAT DIET BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND IT'S A REPORT THAT'S BEEN PICKED UP BY MANY OF THE PAPERS AND IN THE WORDS OF THE MIRROR A LOW FAT DIET DOES NOT STOP A BEASTIE AND CAN EVEN DAMAGE HEALTH
THIS IS A REPORT WHICH IS INSISTING THAT THE OFFICIAL ADVICE IS WRONG THE OFFICIAL ADVICE BEING TO AVOID FATTY MEAT AND DAIRY BECAUSE THEY SUGGEST THAT WHAT IT DOES IS PEOPLE JUST END UP HUNGRY AND THEY SMACK ON MORE DANGEROUS SUGARY FOODS INSTEAD
THE PAPER QUOTES A C. MALHOTRA THE HEART DOCTOR SAINTS PERHAPS THEIR BIGGEST MISTAKE IN MODERN MEDICAL HISTORY RESULTING IN DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE SUGGESTION IS THAT IT HAS LED TO DIABETES AND A BUSY CITY AND IT IS
YOU PICKED UP IN THE OTHER PAPERS LIKE THE TELEGRAPH SUGGESTING THE THIRTY YEARS OF OFFICIAL ADVICE HAS IS FLAWED BEFORE YOU GET TOO EXCITED AND START EATING FATTY FOOD THE OFFICIAL ADVICE OR REMAINS AND WE'LL BE CONSIDERING BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT IN A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SUN BRINGS IS THE NEWS THAT ADELE THE POP SINGER OF COURSE HAS GOT A NINETY MILLION POUND NEW CONTRACT
A SKY HALL EXCLUSIVE HE'S HELD THE SUN DESCRIBED THAT STORY AND THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN WE'RE TO BE KNOWING A LOT MORE ABOUT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS APPARENTLY WHO IS BELIEVE IT OR NOT PRESENTING A PROGRAMME ON THE B.B.C. CALLED TRAIN SPOTTING LIFE SHE'S A UNIVERSITY MATHS LECTURER AND SHE'LL BE APPEARING WITH PETER SNOW BAD OR FRY STARES OUT FROM THE FRONT COVER OF THE DAILY
THAT'S SURPRISINGLY INTEREST WE'RE WE QUITE GONE THE WAY THE NORWEGIANS WHERE YOU JUST HAVE THE BUYER I QUITE LIKE THAT WOULD DO THOUGH IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX TO MANY CHILDREN WHO START THEIR LIFE IN CARE END UP LOCKED UP IN CUSTODY A NEW REPORT OUT TODAY EXAMINES WHY THAT HAPPENS AND HOW THINGS CAN BE IMPROVED ALISON HOLT A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAN TELL US MORE WHO'S THE REPORT FROM ALISON
THE REPORT'S BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE PRISON REFORM TRUST AND HEADED BY LORD LAMINGTON WHO IN THE PAST WAS AN INSPECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEY'VE DRAWN TOGETHER A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA INCLUDING A PANEL OF CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH THE CARE SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS WAS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WHO WERE IN CARE DIDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LAW
STILL THEY WERE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN CHILDREN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION TO BE CAUTIONED OR CONVICTED OF A CRIME AND WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY ABOUT HALF HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN THE CARE SYSTEM IN THAT OVER REP RINSED REPRESENTATION
KINGY CONTINUED UP INTO ADULT LIFE THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE THAT THE POLICE ARE OFTEN CALLED IN WHERE IN A FAMILY IT MIGHT BE THE SITUATION THAT WAS A TICKING OFF FROM SCHOOL TEACHER FROM A PARENT FIGURE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN OTHER WORDS THE SUGGESTIONS BE WITH CRIMINALISED TOO EARLY
THAT WAS CERTAINLY THINK THE EXAMPLE ONE PARTICULAR EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME WAS OF THE TEENAGER WHO WAS IN A CHILDREN'S HOME THERE WERE VERY STRICT RULES THERE DURING THE NIGHT THEY WENT DOWN AND THEY TOOK FOOD FROM THE FRIDGE WELL ANYONE WHO HAS TEENAGERS WILL KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN THEY EAT A LOT
BUT IN THIS SITUATION IT RESULTED IN THAT YOUNG PERSON BEING AT THE POLICE BEING CALLED AND THEM BEING CAUTIONED AND DRAWN INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I TAKE HANDS WONDERFUL I YES
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE REPORT SAYS IS THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIFFERENT WAY OF RECORDING AT CRIMES OF BAD BEHAVIOUR IF YOU LIKE IT SO THAT CHILDREN GET HELP RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL RECORD
THEY ALSO SAY THAT THE FREQUENT CHANGES THAT PLACES WHERE CHILDREN ARE LIVING MOVING THEM FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME CHANGES IN SCHOOL AND THE TURNOVER OF SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE THEIR MAIN POINT OF CONTACT WITH SOCIETY AS A PARENT
ALL OF THAT HAS A REALLY DAMAGING EFFECT ON CHILDREN AND MAKES THEM FEEL ISOLATED AND ANGRY AND THEY SAY THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BUT
THEY POINT TO EARLY INTERVENTION PREVENTING PROBLEMS GETTING DIFFICULT IN FAMILIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THE STRONG LEADERSHIP AND THEY SAY THAT IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S GOOD PRACTICE AND THEY'VE MANAGED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN CARE WHO ARE GETTING CAUGHT
WITH THE POLICE AND GETTING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW ALISON HELP THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT WILL BE TALKING TO THE AUTHOR OF THAT NEW REPORT AS WELL AS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE CARE SYSTEM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
IT'S FORTY MINUTES PAST SIX WE'RE HERE TODAY WITH THE FAR RIGHT CANDIDATE NORBERT HER FUR WILL BECOME AUSTRIA'S NEXT PRESIDENT A CORRESPONDENT BETHANY BELL IS IN VIENNA AND BETHANY THIS IT DEPENDS FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING ON THE POSTAL VOTES WHICH ARE BEING COUNTED TODAY
ABSOLUTELY YES THIS RESULT IS ON A KNIFE EDGE AFTER MOST OF THE DIRECT ALL OF THE DIRECT BALLOTS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IT'S JUST THE POSTAL VOTES THAT WILL DETERMINE THIS RESULT SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND POSTAL VOTES AND I THINK REALLY WE WE SEE A VERY PROFOUND SPLIT
IN AUSTRIA OVER WHICH DIRECTION THE COUNTRY SHOULD TAKE SO THERE'S FIFTY PER CENT FOR THIS CHARISMATIC SOFT SPOKEN FREEDOM PARTY CANDIDATE
AND FIFTY PERCENT FOR HIS OPPONENT TO THE FORMER GREEN POLITICIAN ALEXANDER FOUNDER BELEN WHO HAS A MUCH SOFTER SORT OF MORE PRO EUROPE ASPECT HE HAS CRITICISED ALBERT HALL FOR HIS CRITICISED THE FAR RIGHT SO THERE IS A REAL SPLITS HERE AND I THINK IT MIRRORS TRENDS AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AND IF NORBERT HEREFORD DOES WIN WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR AUSTRIA BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT ROLE IS LARGELY CEREMONIAL ISN'T IT
IT'S LARGELY CEREMONIAL IT DOES HAVE THE POWER TO POTENTIALLY BOTH TO SWEAR IN THE GOVERNMENT AND POTENTIALLY TO DISMISS IT THAT'S NEVER BEEN USED DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN BOTH CANDIDATES MADE
THREATS ABOUT POSSIBLY USING EITHER OF THESE POWERS AND PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S QUITE UNLIKELY THAT THINGS LIKE THAT MIGHT COME BUT THE GREEN PARTY POLITICIAN SAID HE WOULDN'T
YOU FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SWEAR IN A CANDIDATE FROM THE FAR RIGHT NORBERT HALL FOR SAID HE MIGHT DISMISS THE GOVERNMENT IF IT DIDN'T TAKE QUICK ENOUGH ACTION ON THE MIGRANT CRISIS FOR EXAMPLE SO WE'VE HAD THREATS ABOUT THIS
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY'D ACTUALLY GO THAT FAR AND WE DESCRIBE HIM AS FAR RIGHT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT HAS HE SAID ABOUT HOW HE WOULD LIKE AUSTRIA TO CHANGE
HE HAS A CAMPAIGN VERY MUCH ON AN ANTI MIGRANT PLATFORM HE ANTI MUSLIM PLATFORM HE COMES FROM HE'S SORT OF VERY DEEPLY FAR RIGHT FRATERNITY BACKGROUND
WHICH HIS OPPONENTS HAVE CRITICISED AS BEING YOU KNOW SORT OF LOOKING BACK TO MUCH TO AUSTRIA'S PAST IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR SO THERE IS HE HIMSELF THERE YESTERDAY JUST BEFORE HE CAST HIS VOTE SPEAKING IN ENGLISH HAD A MESSAGE FOR EUROPE SAYING THAT HE WASN'T DANGEROUS ALLOW HIM TO WORK
BETHANY BELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE WORLD'S LARGEST INSURER HE'S STUBBING OUT ITS INVESTMENT INTO BACK HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST THE BUSINESS NEWS HE'S ROBBIE MORNING MORNING YES AXA SAYS IT WILL SELL ALL OF ITS SHARES AND BONDS IN TOBACCO COMPANIES THAT'S ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS WORTH
BECAUSE AS WELL AS BEING A LARGE INVESTOR WAS ALSO A MAJOR HEALTH INSURER TOMHAS BLUEBELL THE COMPANY'S INCOMING CHIEF EXECUTIVE TOLD THE B.B.C. THAT AXA'S DIE DOT DIS INVESTING FROM TOBACCO BECAUSE IT MAKES SOUND BUSINESS SENSE WE ARE LAST PROVIDE OF HEALTH CARE INSURANCE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN MORE AND MORE THAT OBVIOUSLY CHRONIC DISEASES HAVE COST A LOT OF MONEY
THAT WE NEED TO INVEST MORE INTO A PREVENTION IN ORDER TO PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASES AND EFFIE ONE TOUR REALLY SUPPORT THAT AND NOT INVEST INTO A BUCKLE WHICH CREATE MORE CHRONIC
IT WILL DEFINITELY AFFECT THEIR FINANCES BUT YOU HAVE TAUGHT SCIENCE YOU HAVE TO ONE SIDE IF YOU DIVEST WHERE YOU WOULD POTENTIALLY HAVE TO REINVEST IN SOMETHING WITH A LOWER YOU
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE LESS CLAIMS COURSE RICHARD DUNBAR IS THE INVESTMENT DIRECTOR ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT AT MANAGES TWO HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS' WORTH OF ASSETS INCLUDING TOBACCO STOCKS MORNING RICHARD GOOD MORNING IN FINANCIAL TERMS ACTORS MOVE IS A SENSIBLE ONE
I OBVIOUSLY FEEL THEY'RE MOVING WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND AS WE HEARD WITH THEIR BROADER INSURANCE BUSINESS BUT IT KEPT OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT ISSUE HERE AND THE COUNTER ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT TO BATTLE LEGAL AND WHO AM I TO SAY THAT OUR OUR SABRES COUNT OWNER DONE MOST FIRMS INCLUDING HER OWN OFFER FUNDS WITH NO TOBACCO IN THEM AND THEY'RE FOR SAVERS CAN MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICE SO WHAT IS THE CASE FOR INVESTING IN TOBACCO STOCKS
THE ECONOMICS TOBACCO OF ECONOMICS OF TOBACCO A FABULOUS IT'S VERY CASH GENERATIVE BUSINESS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE HUGE INVESTMENT AND THE THROWS OFF A LOT OF CASH AND THEREFORE HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY A GREAT DIVIDEND PAYER AND A GREAT GROWER OF DIVIDENDS AND ALSO THE PRODUCT OF THIS PRODUCED IS QUESTIONABLE AND HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY QUESTIONED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS BUT NEVERTHELESS AS A AS AN ECONOMIC MODEL
IT'S BEEN A FABULOUS INVESTMENT OVER THE YEARS THAT'S THE RISK FOR AXEL THEY'RE BALANCING WHAT THEY THINK IS THE RIGHT THING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND THEIR BUSINESS FOR THE THE MERITS OF THE BUSINESS CASE FOR TOBACCO ITSELF THE CALIFORNIA PENSION FUND HELPERS GOT OUT OF TOBACCO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND IS CONSIDERING REINVESTING SAYING IT MISSED OUT ON THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF RETURNS DO YOU THINK MORAL ARGUMENTS SHOULD ANYWAY PLAY A PART IN THE DECISIONS OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS LIKE YOURSELF
I THINK THEY DO THAT THE TROUBLE IN THESE SORTS OF AREAS IS THAT BEAUTY CAN BE IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER SO A COPPER MINE AND AFRICAN CAN BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER OR AN EMPLOYER OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PER LOCALS A WHEN FOR FORM CAN BE
A FANTASTIC SUPPLIER SUSTAINABLE ENERGY OR A BLIGHT ON THE LANDSCAPE SO YOU MAKE YOUR OWN ETHICAL CHOICE AND THOSE ETHICAL CHOICES CAN ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME YOU WERE MISTER I WAS MY BROAD BILLS PREDECESSOR
INTERVIEWED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HE WAS ADDING TO TOBACCO GIVEN THAT AT THAT TIME IT WAS FELT TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH SO THESE CHOICES CHANGE VIEWS OF SOCIETY CHANGE BUT FIRMS LIKE OUR OWN AND AXA WILL TAKE A KYNETON WILL MOVE WITH THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'D THEY SERVE ALL RIGHT THANKS RICHARD STAY WITH US THOUGH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR JAPAN JOINED OTHER COUNTRIES AND TURNING ITS ECONOMY INTO SOMETHING OF A LABORATORY CUTTING INTEREST RATES TO BELOW ZERO
IT'S AN EXPERIMENT CHARGING COMMERCIAL BANKS TO LEAVE MONEY AT THE CENTRAL BANK IN THE HOPE THEY LEND IT OUT INSTEAD TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS THE TROUBLE IS THE RESULTS OF THIS ECONOMIC TRIAL ARE AT BEST UNCLEAR THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF JAPAN HOW HE CHA CHA OR HAS DEFENDED THE POLICY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE B. B. C.
ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT ON THOUGH I DON'T MARK MARKET IS QUITE CLEAR AND ALREADY MADE BUT EMBARKED ON THE ECONOMY AND
PRICES WILL BE GROW SOME MORE PAIN BUT I GONE TO INCLUDE
ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR SOMETHING IT WOULD HAVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
IT WILL HAVE A CLEAR IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY SOON HE SAID THEY'RE SO WHEN WE CONDUCT ERIC BRITAIN DIRECTOR AT FATHOM CONSULTING MORNING ERIC MORNING WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS POLICY IN JAPAN
TUESDAY THE TWELFTH OF NEVER RIGHT IT WAS MY VIEW ON THAT THAT SOON THEY'VE BEEN HOPING FOR THE ECONOMY TO TURN AROUND AND AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT AND PACKAGE POINT ACTION SOON FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THUS FAR THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF IT DOING SO AND FOR US THAT THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE POLICIES IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN NEGATIVE ON THE ECONOMY ON
ON THE VALUE OF STOCKS IN JAPAN ON THE VALUE OF THE CURRENCY AND SO ON HE THE OPPOSITE OF THE DESIRED EFFECT
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE DOING THIS AS WELL ON EVERY YEAR AS OWN SWITZERLAND SWEDEN DENMARK AND THAT THERE ARE MIXED RESULTS THERE ARE AND I WOULD CHARACTERISE THEM AS A WHOLE ARE SAYING COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALREADY IN A VERY WEAK ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF CHRIST AND PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF INFLATION THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IS IS IF ANYTHING NEGATIVE THAT INK IN CAMPUS JAPAN AND ALSO THE EURO AREA WHERE GROWTH IS ALREADY PRETTY STRONG IT CAN HAVE
A MODESTLY POSITIVE EFFECT ON ON ON INFLATION GROWTH AND SO FORTH BUT THAT'S NOT THE ENVIRONMENT IN JAPAN IT'S NOT THE ENVIRONMENT IN EUROPE PEOPLE AND SO WHAT IS NEEDED THEN SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE SPENDING MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF COURSE THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY HEAVILY INDEBTED SHOULD BE BORROWING EVEN MORE MONEY TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY YEAH WELL THAT'S NOT REALLY AN OPTION THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR JAPAN BUT IT IS AN OPTION THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR EUROPE AND IT'S PROBABLY ONE IN OUR JUDGEMENT THAT EUROPE SHOULD BE TAKING THAT FOR US
IMPACT OR RATHER LACK OF IMPACT OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES MEANS ITS TIME IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR MONETARY POLICY IT'S TIME FOR ATTENTION TO SWITCH TO OTHER MEANS TO STIMULATE DEMAND AND IN FACT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT EMERGING TO THE EFFECT THAT LOW OR NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES IS ACTUALLY DAMAGING GROWTH IN THE LONGER TERM AND NOT HAVING ANY IMPACT IN THE SHORT TERM AND SUPPORTING
IT'S A CENTRAL BANKS AS HE HAD TO SIT BACK AND LET THE POLITICIANS GET ON WITH IT WELL FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE IT CAN BE AFFORDED IN COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY IN COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.S. FOR EXAMPLE AND IN CHINA WHERE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT THE BOOT IS ON THE FOOT OF FISCAL POLICY NOW AND SHOULD BE SUN AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT BUT THE COMING COUPLE OF YEARS WHY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE CENTRAL BANKS TO GRADUALLY START TO RAISE INTEREST RATES IN FACT WITH THE CASE AND THAT'S THE RIGHT
WE THINK THE RIGHT POLICY MIX GOING FORWARDS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ERIC AT BRITAIN FROM FATHOM CONSULTANT FROM NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES TO RATE WHICH MAY WELL BE ABOUT TO GO UP RICHARD DUNBAR ARE MARKETS GUESTS ARE STILL WITH US BECAUSE WE HAD RICHARD THE THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOSTON FED AND UNITED STATES ERIC RAISIN GRAND TELLING THE FINANCIAL TIMES THAT HE'S CONFIDENT THAT INTEREST RATES IN THE U.S. WILL GO UP AGAIN THIS YEAR POSSIBLY IN JUNE WHY WE HAVE WE'VE GOT SUCH A DIVERGENCE GLOBALLY IN THE PASSIVE INTEREST RATES
THAT'S WHAT THE U.S. ECONOMY DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S EMERGING FROM THE LONG SLOW DOWN IT'S ENTREPRENEURIAL FLEXIBLE INNOVATIVE IT'S GOT FABULOUS DEMOGRAPHICS AT SELF SUFFICIENT IN ENERGY AND IN TERMS OF HOW THE THIRD ARE LOOKING AT THINGS THEY'RE SEEING ADDITIONAL SIGNS OF A RE BIND IN THE ECONOMY AND SEEING FURTHER STRENGTHENED THE JOBS MARKET AND INFLATION IS HEADING TOWARDS THE TWO PER CENT GOAL THAT THEY HAVE THERE SO ALL THE BOXES HAVE BEEN TICKED THERE THE COMET LOOKS LIKE IT'S PERFORMING NORMALLY WEARS WERE NOT REALLY SEEING THAT AS WE'VE JUST HEARD
IN JAPAN AND WISHING IT TO A LIMITED EXTENT IN EUROPE WE ARE SEEING SOME SIGNS OF LIFE THERE BUT I THINK CERTAINLY POLICY APPEARS TO BE WORKING IN THE U.S. AND OBVIOUSLY AND MONETARY POLICY IN JAPAN AND EUROPE IS PERHAPS WORKING A LITTLE LESS WELL SO WHEN YOU'VE GOT INTEREST RATE GOING DOWN OR BELOW ZERO IN SOME BIG ECONOMIES BUT PERHAPS GOING UP IN OTHERS WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THAT ON THE MARKET
WELL IN THEORY IT SHOULD SWING INVESTMENTS FROM LOWER YIELDING ASSETS ARE ECONOMIES INTO THE HIRELING ON SO IT SHOULD BE POSITIVE FOR THE DOLLAR AND SHOULD BE POTTERS OF FRUIT FOR A DOLLAR ASSETS AND ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THAT SAID THE UNITED STATES ARE STILL THE BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
AND WILL BE I SUSPECT THE PERFORMANCE THAT ECONOMY WILL BE A RISING TIDE THAT LIFTS MANY BOATS SO I SUSPECT THE GOVERNORS THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNORS OF THE CENTRAL BANKS AND EUROPE JAPAN AND ELSEWHERE WOULD JUST BE HOPING THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY IS GOING TO GROW AS CAN START TO TO PULL SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE THE STUPA THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY FINDING THEMSELVES IN
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU RICHARD GOOD TO TALK TO YOU RICHARD DUNBAR THERE FROM ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT NOW TODAY'S THE DEADLINE FOR OFFERS FOR U.K.'S STEEL PLANTS IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT TO HAVE THE BIDDERS ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER LIBERTY HOUSE AND A MANAGEMENT BUY OUT TEAM WILL SUBMIT SEPARATE BEDS BEFORE TODAY'S DEADLINE BUT THEY PLAN TO STATE IN THEIR BIG DOCUMENTS THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP ON A TAKEOVER IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT TARTARE WE'LL DISCUSS THE BID'S AT THE BOARD MEETING THIS WEDNESDAY

SO WELL IT'S CARBON LIBERTY JOSE COOLEY FRONT AND CENTRE IN THIS BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS COMING IN BUT THEY BAYS A CHINESE COMPANY YES TONY
THE PRICE OF STEEL ON GLOBAL MARKETS HAS BEEN RISING QUITE CONSIDERABLY IN RECENT MONTHS YOU THINK TATA STEEL MIGHT BE REGRETTING THEIR DECISION TO SELL I DON'T I THINK THEY'VE COME TO THE SESSION OVER A PERIOD OF TIME I THINK THE GLOBAL STEEL MARKET STILL HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TONS TOO MUCH CAPACITY SO I WOULD SEE THE VALUE OF HER AS A SHORT TERM THEY THOUGHT A SEASONAL THIS IS SECOND QUARTER THIS IS WHEN NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ECONOMIES GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER IN TERMS OF STILL DEMAND I WOULD SUGGEST THE ACTUAL VIEWERS HAD PROBABLY QUITE A GOOD TIME TO GET A BED FOR US
HAS THE PRICE OF STEEL AND REACHED A LEVEL TO MAKE STEEL MAKING IN THE U.K. PROFITABLE AGAIN WAS IT NOT QUITE THERE YET WELL THE MILLION MILLION POSER A DAY THEY WERE LOSING THAT NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE AT THE MOMENT I WOULD SUGGEST THEY WERE CLOSE TO BREAK EVEN THAT THEIR U.K. OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT TIME SO THEREFORE IN THE SHORT TERM PEOPLE BE LOOKING AT MAYBE THIS IS A TOLERANT STORY THE QUESTIONERS HAS HIS OR HER AS A CONFERENCE AT THAT STILL PRICE FOR HAVING THE MOTOR YOU LAWS AND IN JANUARY HAS NO BOTTOM
BUT WHEN SOMEBODY WOULD BUY TARTARS YOU CAISTEAL ASSETS DO THEY IN A SENSE NOT FACTOR IN THE STEEL PRICE GIVEN HOW VOLATILE IT IS ALL ALL THAT BE ABSOLUTELY WHAT SOME BIDDERS ARE FOCUSING ON I THINK SOME BOOKS ON SYBIL HOLD ON MAYBE RIPOSTE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM TERMS A STUPOR THEREFORE OR SOME VOLUME WERE TURNING ROUND THE ECONOMIC CYCLE I THINK PEOPLE FACTOR AND LONG TERM STILL MARGINS AND AN IMPLICATION THERE
AND SEE WHAT HOW CAN I RUN THESE ARE SO IT'S BEST TO BE STRAIGHT FROM AND IF THE PLANS ARE BREAKING EVEN NOW IT IS AS YOU SUGGEST THEY MAY WELL BE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE PENSION FUND WELL IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR A POTENTIAL BUYER TO TAKE ON THAT PENSION FUND ON BOARD OF COURSE THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG OVERHANGS THAT THEY WERE THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT EM
I THINK AS OF YET THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CONFERENCE IN THE GLOBAL STEEL INDUSTRY THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE I THINK A SUSTAINED MARGIN EXPANSION
HOWEVER I THINK THE BUYERS WILL BE FEELING A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENT THAN THEY WERE MAYBE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS MAYBE THESE FRONT ON A REMOTE OH K.

USE FIRST HEAD OF STATE FROM THE FAR RIGHT OF POLITICS IS TO IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL WITH ALL DIRECT BALLETS COUNTED NORBERT HER FURTHER OF THE ANTI IMMIGRATION FREEDOM PARTY AND A FORMER GREEN PARTY LEADER ARE NECK AND NECK A RESULT IS EXPECTED TO BE DECLARED LATER TODAY ONCE POSTAL VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED
A CHARITY THE NATIONAL OBESITY FORUM HAS ATTACKED OFFICIAL DIETARY GUIDELINES WHICH ADVISED PEOPLE TO CUT SATURATED FATS AND BASS MEALS AROUND PASTA OR POTATOES IS AS THE ADVICE IS TO BLAME FOR A RISE IN OBESITY AND DIABETES PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND SAYS THE CHARITY IS BEING IRRESPONSIBLE THANK YOU DIANA IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN A YEAR LONG RECESSION HITTING JOBS INTEREST RATES AND HOUSE PRICES THAT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR
WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF VOTING TO LEAVE THE E. YOU THOSE WHO WANT US TO DO JUST THAT LEAVE OF COURSE NOT MIGHTILY IMPRESSED BY THE TREASURY FORECASTS RATHER MORE IMPRESSED BY STEVE HILTON THEY BECAME HIS OLD FRIEND IN THE MAIL SAYS THE E.U. MAKES BRITAIN IMPOSSIBLE TO GOVERN NORMAN SMITH
JOINT IS ON THE LINE HE'S A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR LET'S BEGIN WITH A TREASURY FORECAST FIRST OF ALL HOW ON EARTH DO THEY PUT A HARD NUMBER ON THE CONSEQUENCE OF BRICKS IT'S NORMAN DO WE KNOW YET WE DON'T BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE REPORT WHAT WE HAVE INSTEAD OF THE CONCLUSIONS ARE PRESS RELEASE DETAILING THE CONCLUSION SO WE DON'T HAVE THE NITTY GRITTY OF HOW THEY REACH THOSE NUMBERS
I MEAN THE CONCLUSION IS YOUR FULL ON DOSSIER OF DOOM FRANKLY I MEAN IT SUGGESTING THAT THE ECONOMY WOULD GROW BY SOMETHING BETWEEN THREE AND SIX PERCENT LESS THAN IF WE REMAINED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE POUND WOULD FALL BY SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PER CENT PRICES WOULD GO UP MORTGAGES WOULD GO UP WITH HIGHER INTEREST RATES THOUSANDS OF JOBS WOULD BE LOST I MEAN
THE STRIKING THING ABOUT IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SORT OF REPORT THEN YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THERE WAS NO CONCEIVABLE WAY YOU COULD VOTE FOR BREAKS IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT THIS REPORT ACTUALLY UNDERLINES IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS REFERENDUM IS NO LONGER
EVEN PRIMARILY ABOUT THE ARGUMENT IS ABOUT CREDIBILITY IT'S ABOUT WHO DO YOU BELIEVE AND IF YOU BELIEVE THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR THAN IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S INCONCEIVABLE YOU COULD POSSIBLY WANT TO VOTE AT THE PLUNGE THE COUNTRY INTO THAT SORT OF ECONOMIC SCENARIO HOWEVER IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE LEAGUE SIDE WHO AT THIS MORNING BORIS JOHNSON HAS DISMISSED THESE CLAIMS AS QUOTES A GIANT HOAX IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE SAVED THERE THEY'RE NOT HONEST
IT'S COME DOWN TO QUITE SIMPLY THIS WHO DO YOU BELIEVE ON THIS REFERENDUM DO YOU BELIEVE THE LIKES OF GEORGE OR GEORGE OSBORNE AND THE PRIME MINISTER OR THE LIKES OF IAN DUNCAN SMITH AND BORIS JOHNSON OR INDEED YOU BELIEVE STEVE HELP AND WHO DOESN'T IN FACT INTERESTINGLY DISPUTE THE CLAIM THAT WE MIGHT BE WORSE OFF AT THE END OF HIS PIECE IN THE MAIL HE SAYS OF COURSE THERE'S A RISK INVOLVED IN LEAVING THE E.U. BUT SAYS EFFECTIVELY IT'S A RISK WORTH TAKING
HIS ARGUMENT IS ALMOST MORE ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY OF SEEMS TO ME HE ARGUES THAT BRITAIN IS QUOTES ALMOST UNGOVERNABLE BECAUSE OF THE SHEER WEIGHT OF LEGISLATION COMING FROM THE E.U. HE ALSO REFERS BACK TO THE DEAL DONE BY THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING THE PRIME MINISTER WAS JUST SEEKING MODEST CHANGES WHICH WERE CONTEMPTUOUSLY DISMISSED
BY THE E.U. AND HE SUGGESTS IS THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN INSIDE THE E.U. THEN THE E.U. WILL EXACT REVENGE BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE SURRENDERED ANY LEVERAGE WE HAVE FOR REFORM AND HE SAYS THE SUGGESTION THAT EUROPE IS SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN REFORM IS ABOUT AS CREDIBLE AS SAYING VLADIMIR PUTIN IS INTERESTED IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY OH KEINO NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN IS A LOW FAT DIET GOOD OR BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND AND TO CHARITIES COMPLETELY DISAGREE ON THE ANSWER TO THAT ADAM IS A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT AND ADAM LET'S START WITH WHAT THESE TWO CHARITIES ARE SAYING WHICH IS THAT WE THE OFFICIAL ADVICE HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY WRONG AND BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER FOR ALL OUR HEALTH
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN THIS WHOLE AREAS IS HUGELY CONTESTED AS ONE OF THE MOST SORT OF POLARISED AREAS OF OF HEALTH POLICY BUT OF COURSE IT MATTERS SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN TERMS OF OBESITY AND TYPE TWO DIABETES SO THE BASIS FOR THE OFFICIAL ADVICE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE EATWELL GUY WHICH WAS UPDATED JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND APPLIES ACROSS THE U.K. AND IT SETS OUT RECOMMENDED PROPORTIONS OF DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES
SOME PARTS ARE NOT CONTROVERSIAL FOR EXAMPLE SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO EAT LOTS OF VEGETABLES BUT THESE TWO CHARITIES REALLY ARE CONTESTING THREE MAIN AREAS FIRST OF ALL THE ADVICE THAT THE DIET SHOULD BE BASED AROUND STARCHY CARBOHYDRATE FOOD THINGS LIKE POTATOES BREAD RICE AND PASTA AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO OILS AND SPREADS THE GUIDELINES SAY THEY RECOMMEND TO HER VEGETABLE OIL LOW FAT SPREADS AND IN TERMS OF DAIRY THEY SAY WE SHOULD GO FOR
LOW FAT OPTIONS REDUCING THE SATURATED FAT INTAKE AND THE NATIONAL FORUM SO THIS ADVICE HAS FUELLED A BEATER CITY AND TYPE TWO DIABETES OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES AND MORE AND AT THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE GUIDELINES HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND THE CHARITIES HAVE COME UP WITH THEIR OWN SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND WHICH PUTS OUT THIS OFFICIAL ADVICE SAYS THEY'RE WRONG THOUGH AND STANDS BY WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SET
WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS SAYS THAT THIS THIS DOCUMENT PRODUCED BY BY THE NATIONAL BEASTIE FORM IS RESPONSIBLE BUT IN THE NATION'S HEALTH AT RISK AND IT SAYS THAT THERE'S BEEN AN EXHAUSTIVE TRAWL OF ALL THE EVIDENCE BEHIND THE OFFICIAL GUIDELINES WHEREAS IT SAYS THE NATIONAL BE SETTEE FORUM HAS BEEN GUILTY OF CHERRY PICKING
THE EVIDENCE TO SUIT ITS ARGUMENTS AND HE SAID IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE IS A MAJORITY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BEHIND THE STANCE TAKEN BY PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND IN SUPPORT OF THE OFFICIAL GUIDELINES BUT THE NATIONAL BEAT OBESITY FORUM SAYS MORE CLEARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURES IN TERMS OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OBESITY THE GUIDELINES FOR MANY PEOPLE JUST AREN'T WORKING AND WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE
THE ORTHODOXY AND THAT THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THEY SAY FOR MANY PEOPLE TO GO FOR A LOW CARB HIGH FAT DIET IN ORDER TO ROLL BACK TYPE TWO DIABETES AND OBESITY AND WHAT THEIR ARGUMENT IS THAT PEOPLE END UP HUNGRY SO SNACK MORE
I WILL THEY'RE SAYING HE'S CHARITIES ARE SAYING NO CERTAINLY DON'T SNACK BUT DON'T DON'T COUNT CALORIES IN TERMS OF LOSING WEIGHT AND WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM AN APPROACH WHICH BEARS DOWN ON ON ON FAT IN TAPE BECAUSE THEY ARGUE CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF SATURATED FAT CONTENT IN DAIRY PRODUCTS THEY SAY THAT'S A PROTECTIVE AND REALLY CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY WOULD CALL A HEALTHY HIGH FAT DIET INCLUDING THINGS LIKE EGG SIR NUTS OLIVES FISH AND AVOCADOS
ADAM HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN REMEMBER FOR LUCHA ONE OF THE LONGEST AND BLOODIEST BATTLES OF THE IRAQ WAR OF COURSE ON THAT CITY IS THE FOCUS OF ANOTHER STRATEGICALLY SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT AS IRAQI GOVERNMENT FORCES PREPARE AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY IN AN EFFORT TO TRY AND TAKE IT FROM THE FIGHTERS OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WHO SEIZED IT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO JIM YOU'RE IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BAGHDAD MORNING DEW JIM HOW SOON WILL THE ASSAULT BEGIN
WELL ACCORDING TO THE PRIME MINISTER IT IS SORT OF UNDER WAY IT WAS HERALDED THE YESTERDAY BY THE MILITARY OR WARNING CIVILIANS TO TRY AND GET OUT OF LONG APPROVED SAFE ROUTES AND IF NOT THEN TWO TO PUT WHITE FLAGS OVER THEIR HOUSES TO STAY WELL AWAY FROM OUR BASES OR OFFICES OR WHATEVER COS THEY WOULD BE TARGETED BY AIR STRIKES SO NOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER DURING THE NIGHT HAS SAID HE PROCLAIMED THE OPERATION IT'S GOT THE NAME IT'S CALLED BREAK TERRORISM
AND HE SAYS THAT THE MOMENT OF GREAT VICTORY IS APPROACHING NOW WHETHER THEY'VE ACTUALLY STARTED ADVANCING AND FIRING PERHAPS SOFTENING UP STUFF WE JUST DON'T KNOW BUT CERTAINLY I THINK LATER IN THE DAY THEY WILL START TO TO TO TO TO MOVE BECAUSE THEY'VE HELD IT AS MUCH AS GOING TO LOOK A BIT BIZARRE HAVE THEY DON'T PSYCHOLOGICALLY SIGNIFICANT OF COURSE PARTLY COS THE HISTORY FOR ME IS IT STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL
WELL IT IS COS IT'S RIGHT ON THE MAIN ROAD THAT LEADS OUT OF BAGHDAD TO THE WEST GOES TO JORDAN AND TO SYRIA IT CONTROLS THAT ROAD DATES WHAT HALF AN HOUR'S DRIVE REALLY FROM TOWN THAT'S ROUGHLY SORT OF THIRTY MILES DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU TO FIND THE EDGE OF BAGHDAD
SO IT IS REALLY IS STRATEGIC ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN THAT'S WHERE THEY PLOT SOME OF THE BOMB ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING OFF ON HOT GOING OFTEN IN BAGHDAD RECENTLY AND SO ON BUT AS YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT IS A VERY HARDCORE SUNNI AREA THAT HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME IT RESISTED THE AMERICANS IN TWO THOUSAND FOR NOW HERE WE ARE TWELVE YEARS LATER AND IT'S STILL A THORN IN THE SIDE OF THAT THE POWERS THAT BE HERE NOW
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY TO MIX METAPHORS METAPHORS NUT TO CRACK IF I US DECIDE TO MAKE A STAND THERE IT COULD BE A LONG AND BLOODY BATTLE COS WE'VE SEEN MANY INSTANCES WHERE JUST A FEW FIGHTERS CAN HOLD OUT IN BUILT UP TERRAIN THEY KNOW AGAINST ARMY IS SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL BE LEFT WHEN THE ARMY FINALLY GETS RIGHT IN THERE TIM YOU'RE IN BAGHDAD THANK YOU
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND ACCORDING TO THE DAILY MAIL STEVE HILTON'S DECISION TO BACK BRECK'S IT IS A SHATTERING BLOW TO DAVID CAMERON IT DESCRIBES THE PRIME MINISTER'S FORMER POLICY GURU AS THE FEROCIOUSLY BRIGHT SUN OF HUNGARIAN REFUGEES ARE MY OLDEST AND CLOSEST POLITICAL FRIEND IN AN ARTICLE FOR THE MALE MY ELTON SAYS POWER NEEDS TO BE TAKEN BACK FROM ARROGANT UNACCOUNTABLE CUBISTIC ELITES

THE MALE PRAISES WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS HIS DEVASTATING LOGIC HE TELEGRAPH THE TIMES IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES LEAD INSTEAD ON THE TREASURY CLAIMS THAT BRICKS IT WOULD TRIGGER A RECESSION DAVID CAMERON GEORGE OSBORNE WRITER JOINED ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH AND WHICH THEY STAY STAYING IN THE E.U. MEANS A BRIGHTER FUTURE IS ON OFFER IN AN EDITORIAL THAT F. T. CLAIMED THE BRICKS IT
WOULD DAMAGE THE CITY BUT CONCEDE POLITICALLY A VOTE TO KEEP THE CITY AND CHAMPAGNE AND YACHTS MAY SEEM AN AWKWARD SELL TO THE ELECTORATE HOWEVER IT SAYS THE FINANCIAL SECTOR PAID SIXTY SIX BILLION POUNDS IN TAXES LAST YEAR HER REMAINS ONE OF THE FEW AREAS IN WHICH THE COUNTRY IS UNDISPUTED GLOBAL LEADER
THE DAILY EXPRESS AND DAILY MIRROR LEAD ON CLAY IN THOSE CLAIMS THAT OFFICIAL ADVICE TO EAT A LOW FAT DIET IS HAS BEEN WRONG FOR DECADES THE MIRROR QUOTES A HEART DOCTOR A SEEN MALHOTRA WHO WILL BE SPEAKING TO LATER DESCRIBING IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE AND MODERN MEDICAL HISTORY RESULTING IN DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACCORDING TO THE EXPRESS THE CHARITY THE NATIONAL BEASTIE FOR IS ADVISING PEOPLE TO RETURN TO WHOLE FOODS SUCH AS MEAT FISH AND DAIRY AS WELL AS HIGH FAT HEALTHY FOODS INCLUDING AVOCADOS ARGUING THAT
EATING FAT DOES NOT MAKE YOU FAT THE BABY SAYS THE HE'S ANGERED WHAT IT CALLS THE HEALTH ESTABLISHMENT EAT FAT TO GET FIT SAYS A HEADLINE IN THE SUN THE GUARDIAN REPORTS THE BRITAIN'S PAST ANOTHER MILESTONE ON THE WAY TO A CASHLESS SOCIETY INTEREST TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS THE FIRST YEAR THE CASH WAS USED FOR A FEW THAN HALF OF ALL PAYMENTS BY CONSUMERS PAYMENT U.K. WHICH REPRESENTS THE MAJOR BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES THIS CASH IS MADE UP FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF ALL TRANSACTIONS LAST YEAR AND IS EXPECTED TO FALL
TO A QUARTER WITHIN A DECADE THE ROYAL HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY'S ACCUSE THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION ARE FAILING TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN HOW TO LOOK AFTER THEIR GARDENS ACCORDING TO THE TIMES IT MEANS TODAY'S ADULTS ARE NEGLECTING THEIR GARDENS OR TREATING THEM AS OUTDOOR LIVING ROOMS WITH DECKING BARBECUES AND PATIOS BUT FEW PLANTS THE BABY SAYS JUST ONE PER CENT OF TODAY'S PARENTS WERE TAUGHT GARDENING WHILE AT SCHOOL COMPARED WITH FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR PARENTS' GENERATION
OVER THE WEEKEND THE R.H.S. HIGHLIGHTED THE NEGLECT OF FRONT GARDENS JANE SHILLING IN THE TELEGRAPH SHARES THAT CONCERN DESCRIBING IT AS AN IMPOVERISHMENT IMPOVERISHMENT IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WAY FINALLY THE SUN SAYS ADELE IS TO SIGN THEIR BIGGEST EVER RECORD DEAL FOR A BRITISH MUSICIAN THE NINETY MILLION POUND CONTRACT WITH SONY IS ALSO SAID TO BE THE BIGGEST EVER FOR A WOMAN BEATING THE PREVIOUS RECORD OF A MERE SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS SET BY WHITNEY HOUSTON BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WHAT
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING IS THAT WITH A MONTH TO GO TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED THAT VOTING FOR BRECK'S IT COULD PLUNGE BRITAIN INTO A YEAR LONG RECESSION ACCLAIM CLAIM WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS AS FANTASTICAL
THEY MAY NOT HAVE A VOTE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE WATCHING TO SEE HOW WE WILL VOTE IN MET E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH IS A MONTH FROM TODAY INDIA IS NOW THE THIRD BIGGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN BRITAIN ALL CORRESPONDENT JUSTIN ROLLER HAS BEEN FINDING OUT HOW INDIAN BUSINESS REGARDS THE PROSPECT OF A POSSIBLE BRECK'S
I'VE BEEN A FASTER GARMENT FACTORY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF DELHI
OH UPON ROW OF PEOPLE STITCH
I WATCH YOU MAKING MAKING PYJAMA MAKING SOME PYJAMAS HERE AND THESE ARE FOREVER THAT OTHER LINES MANUFACTURE FOR NEXT FOUR MONTHS
AND LOTS OF OTHER U.K. HIGH STREET
BOSS SOUP HERE BINKA HAS DONE WELL HE OWNS A SMALL FLEET OF SPORTS CARS BUT HE WORRIES ABOUT THE IMPACT BRECK'S IT WILL HAVE ON HIS BUSINESS
HE THINKS SALES WILL FALL BECAUSE THE U.K. ECONOMY WILL SHRINK
IT IS BOUND TO HAPPEN AND I THINK IT IS ALMOST SUICIDE AND FOR YOU TO EVEN WANT TO LEAVE THEIR DRAWING THAT HUGE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT
THE CHOICE WILL BE DO YOU WANT TO BE IN EUROPE I DO YOU WANT TO BE IN YORK AT WHICH MEANS THE BALANCE SHEET OFF DUFFY O.K. WILL SHRINK IRONICALLY THE INDIA OPERATION OF ONE OF HIS KEY CUSTOMERS SEES THINGS A BIT DIFFERENTLY
AND THIS IS FOR ONE POINT
WITH FIFTY FOUR SHOPS IN TWENTY FOUR CITIES INDIA IS ONE OF MARKS AND SPENCER'S TOP FIVE MARKETS LIKE MANY INDIAN BUSINESS PEOPLE THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT VENTURE THAT RUNS M. AND S. INDIA IS OFFICIALLY AGNOSTIC ON BRAX IT BUT THEN WHO NAIA BELIEVES THE U.K. LEAVING EUROPE COULD HAVE BENEFITS FOR HIS BUSINESS
OUR PRODUCTS FROM THIS REGION AS WELL AS A LOT OF THAT COMES IN FROM THE U.K. AS WELL
ANY TREE THEY COULD BE MEN WHICH WOULD LEAD TO LOWER DUTIES DEFINITELY
ARE SOURCING FROM THE U.K. AND AS A RESULT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKET
BUT TRADE IS JUST ONE PART OF THE STORY INVESTMENT MATTERS TO AND INDIA IS NOW THE THIRD BIGGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE U.K.
TONIGHT AT TEN FRESH UNCERTAINTY OVER THE FUTURE OF BRITISH STEEL MAKING THE INFLUENCE OF INDIA WAS ALL TOO APPARENT EARLIER THIS MONTH WHEN THE BOARD OF THE GIANT INDIAN CONGLOMERATE TATA GROUP DECIDED TO SELL OFF ITS U.K. STEEL BUSINESS JOBS AT RISK
BUT TARTARE IS KEEPING HOLD OF ITS OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE U.K. EVEN WITHOUT THE STEEL BUSINESS TARTARE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYERS IN BRITAIN AND THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST MANUFACTURER AS WELL AS STEEL IT OWN SOME EMBLEMATIC BUSINESSES INCLUDING
CAT
BUT THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN SO TO SPEAK IS UNDOUBTEDLY JAGUAR LAND ROVER WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS DOOR YOU'RE GOING TO ENTER THE LARGEST ALUMINIUM BODY SHOP IN THE WORLD
LAST YEAR I VISITED THE COMPANY'S TRULY NOT A BILLION NEW ASSEMBLY LINE OUTSIDE BIRMINGHAM WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE ROBOTS
NEVER GET TIRED YOUR LANDROVERS POSITION ON BRAX IT IS CLEAR IT BELIEVES BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN LIKE MANY INDIAN COMPANIES IT USES BRITAIN AS A BRIDGEHEAD INTO THE WIDER EUROPEAN MARKET SAYS BEDE ARE SAYING SECRETARY GENERAL OF INDIA'S MAIN BUSINESS ASSOCIATION THE FEDERATION OF INDIAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY HE SAYS MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED INDIAN COMPANIES HAVE INVESTMENTS IN BRITAIN
EVERY LARGE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN IN COMPANIES WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE U.K.
AS YOU KNOW THEY LOOK GOOD ANOTHER AS A GATEWAY TO THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND A PRIME MINISTER SAID EXACTLY THE SAME THING WHEN HE WAS THERE MAYBE SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT CERTAINLY THE MARKET CAN POSSIBLY REDUCE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON INDIAN PLAYED AN INDIAN COMPANIES WHICH ACCESSING LIKE USING IT AS A GIFT WE HAVE
BUT MISTER SAYING LIKE THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER MISTER MODI IS VERY CAREFUL TO STRESS THAT WHILST INDIA HAS AN INTEREST IN THE REFERENDUM THE DECISION
CAN ONLY BE MADE IN BRITAIN JUSTIN ROLLER AT REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THOUSANDS OF HIGH STREET CHEMISTS IN ENGLAND COULD CLOSE BECAUSE HER PLANS TO CUT THEIR FUNDING FROM THE N.H.S. BY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS THE DEPARTMENT FELT ARGUES THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THERE ARE MORE PHARMACIES THEM ARE NEEDED BY ONE ESTIMATE IT COULD LEAD TO ONE IN FOUR CLOSING WERE CLAIRE WARD CHAIRS PHARMACY VOICE WHICH IS AN UMBRELLA GROUP FOR BOTH
BIG AND SMALL PHARMACIES SHE JOINS US FROM NOTTINGHAM GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS WE CERTAINLY ARE AND WE ARE PUBLISHING TODAY A REPORT THAT SHOWS THE IMPACT OF CLOSURES OF COMMUNITY PHARMACY WHICH INDICATES THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY GOING TO THE LOCAL PHARMACY IF THEY WERE TO LOSE THAT ONE IN FOUR OF THEM
WOULD THEN BE FORCED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AT THEIR G.P. SURGERY AND THAT RISES TO FOUR OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE IN SOME OF THE MOST DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY NOW WE ALREADY KNOW THAT G.P. SURGERIES ARE UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT COPE WITH THIS INCREASED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE FLOCKING TO THEIR DOORS
AS A RESULT A COMMUNITY PHARMACY CLOSURES BUT N.H.S. ENGLAND TO MAKE THE OBVIOUS POINT REALLY THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE BEST FROM OUR RESOURCES AND THEY POINT OUT THE FORTY PER CENT OF PHARMACIES RING CLUSTERS OF THREE OR MORE WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF EACH OTHER WE DON'T NEED THAT MANY SO FIRST OF ALL WE ALL WANT TO SEE GOOD USE OF N.H.S. MONEY AND EFFICIENCY BUT WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING IS MAKING THE MOST OF COMMUNITY PHARMACY
AND THESE ARE NOT SIMPLY PLACES WHERE MEDICINES HANDED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTER THERE PLACES WHERE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ARE PROVIDING A WHOLE RANGE OF SERVICES AND ADVICE AND ACTUALLY WASH ARGUES IN THAT THOUGH THE ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN YOU NEED YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE THAT BUT WHY HAVE SO MANY SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
WELL BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE DIFFERENT SERVICES AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SO IF YOU LOOK IN LONDON FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF PHARMACIES THEY OFTEN SIR VERY VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE SPECIALIST LANGUAGES SUPPORT WITHIN THEM THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO PARTICULAR ETHNIC COMMUNITIES WITHIN THAT SOME OF THEM WILL PROVIDE A DIFFERENT LEB DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES
SO YOU CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE AN ARBITRARY CUT WHICH IS WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT ARE DOING AND THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO RESULT IN A BETTER SPREAD OF COMMUNITY PHARMACY SERVICES ONE HUNDRED SO THAT IN SOME AREAS THERE ARE TOO MANY THE ODD YOUR BEEF IS REALLY JUST THAT THEN THAT IT'S IT THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH ONES WILL CLOSE ISN'T BEING MANAGED NO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR COMMUNITY PHARMACY TO BE BETTER USED AND THAT DIFFERENT COMMUNITY
HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNITY PHARMACY AND USE THOSE SERVICES IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SUGGESTING IS THAT AN ARBITRARY CUT A DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITY PHARMACIES AND WHY THEY ARE BEING USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS BY PEOPLE ANY DRESSING IN THERE CHIEF PHARMACEUTICAL OFFICER SAYS THAT WHAT THEY'RE CONSULTING ON HIS
CHANGES THAT WILL BETTER INTEGRATE PHARMACY INTO THE N.H.S. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT USING THE SKILLS A PHARMACIST IN G.P. SURGERIES IN A. AND E. AND CARE HOMES IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND USING BETTER USE OF TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN JUST HAVING THEM SPRINKLED ALONG THE HIGH STREET NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER SO WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME PHARMACISTS WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH G.P. SURGERY
BUT THEY ARE NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR COMMUNITY PHARMACY WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT PATIENTS LIKE THAT IDEA BUT WHAT THEY WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS THEY WOULD THEN HAVE TO GET APPOINTMENTS AGAIN WITH THEIR G.P. SURGERY AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THOSE HAVE UNDER PRESSURE COMMUNITY PHARMACY PROVIDES THE MOST ACCESSIBLE N.H.S. SERVICES BECAUSE YOU CAN WALK IN WITHOUT APPOINTMENT AND WE KNOW IT'S A WATCH RIDER SERVICE THAN IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT G.P.S CLAIRE WARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HE'S TURKEY JOINING THE EWE AS THOSE WHO WANT US TO QUIT ARE CLAIMING OR SHE DESPERATE TO JOIN BUT MIGHT FIND THE ROAD TO BRUSSELS A VERY LONG ONE WHICH ENDS UP WITH A VETO
THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF A CLASH BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND ONE OF HIS OWN MINISTERS YESTERDAY LET'S GET A TURKISH PERSPECTIVE ON IT NOW DOCTOR TURNER HALLOWES IS THE CHAIR OF THE UNION OF EUROPEAN TURKISH DEMOCRATS A LOBBY GROUP CAMPAIGNS FOR TURKEY TO JOIN AND HE JOINS US IN THE STUDIO HERE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT HOW LIKELY IT IS THAT TURKEY WILL JOIN ME
THERE IS ACTUALLY NOT OBSTACLE IN TURKEY JOINING THE E.U. AND IT IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A TURKEY
AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN EUROPE AND IN THE U.K. IT IS COMPLICATED IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND A PRIME MINISTER IS NOT WRONG IN COURTING A LONG TIME FRAME IT BUT IT LOOKED IMPOSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT IT LIKE YOU'S IMPOSSIBLE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION BACK TOMORROW WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE PUBLIC WOULD MY CHANGE THAT AT THE TIME IT WOULD BE VERY EASY
HAVE YOU WHAT'S CURIOUS AS YOU SAY NO OBSTACLE AND YET ANGELA MERKEL FOR EXAMPLE IN GERMANY IS IS A LIFELONG OPPONENT A TURKISH MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. SO IF IT WERE TO COME NOW AS A PROPOSAL NOT ONLY COULD BRITAIN VETO IT GERMANY AUSTRIA FOR GOODNESS SAKE GIVE HIM THE POLITICS OF AUSTRIA AT THE MOMENT HUNGRY OTHER COUNTRIES COULD ALL EAT
THAT'S EXACTLY TRUE BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE WITH FOR EXAMPLE ROMANIA BULGARIA
OBSTACLES IN FRONT OF THEM FOR MORE THAN TURKEY
IN THAT RESPECT THERE ISN'T NOTHING TO OBJECT AND IT HAS THAT EVERYBODY WHO IS INVOLVED IN THIS POLITICS WHO IS THE NOISE THIS SUBJECT IN THAT KNOWS THAT
THERE IS A TURKEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO EUROPE THERE IS A LOT THAT BOTH SIDES CAN BENEFIT BY BEING TOGETHER THE OBSTACLES THAT PEOPLE POINT TO INTERNALLY IN TURKEY RATHER THAN EXTERNALLY IS THE WAY TURKEY RUNS HERSELF A LACK OF RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AND A LACK OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHT
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OPEN TO DEBATE THERE IT'S ELLA AS A SQUAB TOOK A PROGRESS OF COURSE AND E.U. HAS BEEN USED FOR THAT AS HER ENCOURAGEMENT AND JOINING THE E.U. HAS ENCOURAGED A LOT OR REFORM THE RELATIONS OF THE ARMY
THE REFORMS THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE WITH THIS EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE WAS VERY USEFUL AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE DRAWBACKS HAS CAUSED AS BEING CAUSED BY THIS TREATMENT OF EUROPE TO TURKEY
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS TURKEY'S APPLICATION TO JOIN DATES BACK EVEN LONGER THAN THAT WHEN IT FIRST TALKED ABOUT IT TRY AND GUESS IT IS A GUESS HOW SOON DO YOU THINK IT LIKELY THAT TURKEY COULD JOIN ME
IT DEPENDS I THINK ON PUT AND ECONOMICAL CYCLE IF IF THERE IS A PRETTY WHAT'S THE SHORTEST
IT CAN BE A DECADE IT CAN BE FIFTY YEARS I DON'T KNOW BUT IT IT DEPENDS ON THE MOOD ON THE POLITICAL WORLD IN EUROPE IT'S NOT ANYTHING ELSE AND IF IT HAPPENS
WOULD MANY TURKS WANT TO MOVE TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE UNDERLYING THE WARNING POSTERS ARE THE SUGGESTION IS THE SUGGESTION THAT MANY TURKS REMOVE IT LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT THERE IS ALREADY A BIG TURKISH POPULATION INTO YOU IN EUROPE IN U.K. AS WELL AND THIS HAS NOT CREATED A PROBLEM FOR EUROPE YOU'D HAS APRIL YOU MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO CUP THAN THE POPULATION OF TURKISH MISTY IN EUROPE IS MORE THAN MANY SMALL COUNTRIES EUROPEAN MEMBER COUNTRIES AND

THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY A FORMER DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHO HAS DESCRIBED IT AS REASONABLE THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE SAYS THE STUDY SHOWS LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD RESULT IN A D.I.Y. RECESSION LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DISMISSED THE WARNING AS AN UNJUSTIFIED SCARE STORY HERE'S OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMO AHMED
WITH A MONTH TO GO UNTIL THE REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN IT STARKERS WARNING YET ON THE EFFECT IT BELIEVES LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HAVE ON THE ECONOMY OR THREE POINT SIX PERCENT REDUCTION IN GROWTH WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DESCRIBES AS THE SHOCK SCENARIO WOULD PLUNGE BRITAIN INTO A YEAR LONG RECESSION THE TREASURY REPORT CLAIMS ITS ECONOMIC MODEL ASSUMES Y. YOU TRADE WOULD BE AFFECTED AND UNCERTAINTY AND MARKET VOLATILITY WOULD LEAD TO LESS INVESTMENT
THE ANALYSIS RELEASED IN FULL LATER TODAY WHEN THE NUMBERS WILL BE TESTED BY ECONOMISTS IS ALSO LIKELY TO PAINT A BLEAK PICTURE OF THE EFFECT OF BRECHT'S IT ON INFLATION WAGERS EMPLOYMENT AND THE VALUE OF STERLING WHICH COULD FALL THE DOCUMENT SUGGESTS BY TWELVE PERCENT
THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE STUDY BY ITS OWN ECONOMISTS ECHOED RECENT WARNINGS FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THOSE THAT BACK BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. SAID THE ANALYSIS WAS BIASED AND FANTASTICAL THEY SAID SIMILAR WARNINGS ABOUT THE U.K. LEAVING THE FORERUNNER TO THE SINGLE CURRENCY THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM HAD PROVED TO BE WRONG AND THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD GIVE THE U.K. ECONOMY MORE FREEDOMS TO TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD

CALLUM MAY REPORTING IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN VOTE BRICKS IT GET RECESSION THAT'S WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND CHANCELLOR A WARNING TODAY THEY POINT TO A TREASURY ANALYSIS TO BE PUBLISHED LATER TODAY THAT SUGGEST THE ECONOMY WOULD BE PLUNGED INTO A YEAR LONG RECESSION WITH G. P. DROPPING BY AS MUCH AS SIX PER CENT THE POUND SLUMPING IN VALUE AND THOUSANDS LOSING THEIR JOB
WE DON'T HAVE THE TREASURY REPORT BUT WE DO HAVE THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAINT JA JAVID IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS BIG DOOM AND GLOOM THAT'S BEEN PUT UP BY THE TREASURY TODAY THIS IS A SERIOUS SO WERE ANALYSIS AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY BUT THE VOTE IS GOING TO BE IN EXACTLY A MONTH'S TIME
FROM NOW IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DECISION OF A LIFETIME'S MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE STILL UNDECIDED AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS REPORT PROVIDES O.K. LET'S TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT MY QUESTION REALLY WAS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS A EUROSCEPTIC AS A BRUSSELS BASHER DO YOU BELIEVE IT
YES I DO I'VE SEEN THE REPORT AND MYSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE WILL HAVE TO TIME TO SEE IT IN DETAIL IN A FEW HOURS FROM NOW AND IT IS VERY VERY CONVINCING BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE TREASURY FORECASTING SUCH OUTCOMES WE KNOW ALREADY FROM JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO BUT BOTH THE BANK OF ENGLAND
THE I.M.F. HAVE SAID AND I THINK WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER EVERYONE SHOULD SIT UP SERIOUSLY AND LOOK AT THIS REPORT OF COURSE IT WAS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF TRUST IN WHAT THE TREASURY HAD BEEN SAYING THAT THE O.B. ART WAS SET UP
AND ACTUALLY THEO BE ARE IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS THERE ARE SAID ITS DIRECTOR HAS SAID THAT HE EXPECTS THERE TO BE A PROFOUND AND ECONOMIC SHOCK AS WELL IF THE E. YOU IF THE U.K. WILL VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND WHAT WE'LL SEE FROM THIS REPORT WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED THIS FULL DETAIL TODAY IT'S JUST THAT WILL BE AN IMMEDIATE AND PROFOUND ECONOMIC SHOCK IT WAS A YEAR LONG RECESSION
IT WILL BUT WITHIN TWO YEARS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A RECESSION THAT IN THIS SORT OF CENTRAL SCENARIO AS IT WERE OF THE REPORT SHOWS A RECESSION OF THREE POINT SIX PERCENT CONTRACTION IN G.D.P. HIGHER INFLATION HOUSE PRICES TEN PERCENT LOWER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE AND I THINK MOST WORRYINGLY OF ALL A LOSS OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS IT WILL MAKE A COUNTRY POORER AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THAT'S THE WAY THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO OF COURSE YOU CAN GET THAT
AT THE END OF AN ECONOMIC A MODELLING IF YOU PUT IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT FIGURES YOU PUT IN AND THERE ARE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE TREASURY FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE DONE AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF ANY OF THE POSSIBLE POSITIVES NOT LEAST THERE ARE ADVANTAGES TO A DROP IN STIRLING
WELL FIRST OF ALL THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WOULD LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET IS THE THE VIEW OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID HIMSELF MADE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT HE SEES AS LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE LARGEST ECONOMIC ZONE IN THE WORLD AND IF WE WALK AWAY FROM THAT THEY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE LESS TRADE UNLESS INVESTMENT
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY BE A HUGE RISE IN UNCERTAINTY AND FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY AND NOT SUSPICIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS TREASURY DOCUMENT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S READ IT WE HAVEN'T READ IT BUT ARE YOU NOT SUSPICIOUS THAT THEY'RE ONLY PUTTING IN CERTAIN FACTORS THEY'RE PUTTING IN SOMETHING TO PAINT A PICTURE THAT IS FAR WORSE THAT MANY PEOPLE EVEN THOSE WHO WANT US TO STAY WOULD SAY WOULD BE THE CAKES NO NOT AT ALL I THINK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SEE THE REPORT YOU'LL SEE THERE'S TWO SCENARIOS THEY'RE ACTUALLY MODELLED THE SHOCK'S AN ARIA IN A SEVERE SHOCKS AN ARIA IN THE SHOCK SCENARIO
ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ARE THERE FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND ANALYSE AND THERE ARE ENTIRELY CREDIBLE AND EVEN IN THE POSITIVE SCENARIO IF WHAT THAT IT'S UP TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TO SHOW WHAT THAT POSITIVE SCENARIO IS BUT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE E.U. WE KNOW WE'RE NOT IN THE EURO WE KNOW WE'RE NOT IN THE SHOW WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO EVER CLOSER UNION AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WIN THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH IS OF HUGE VALUE TOUR A FIRMS AND TO INDIVIDUALS
BUT IF WE LEAVE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS GOING TO BE OTHER THAN KNOWING THAT WE WILL BE LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET WILL BE WALKING AWAY FROM THAT AND OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE ECONOMIC COST TO THAT O.K. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUE STEVE HILTON POINTS OUT IN THE DAILY MAIL TODAY WHICH IS WHY HE'S COMING OUT IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S IT WHICH IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE VOTE TO STAY IN AND HE SUGGESTS THAT ACTUALLY THERE WILL BE ALMOST A FORM OF REVENGE ON BRITAIN FOR THE REFERENDUM IF IT VOTES TO STAY
STEVE HE'S ENTITLED TO HIS VIEWS AS IS EVERYONE ELSE AND WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND I THINK THE THE CENTRAL ISSUE REALLY HEARS THAT ECONOMICALLY WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF BEING PART OF THIS SINGLE MARKET THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD WHICH BY THE WAY DOESN'T JUST ALLOW US TO SELL OUR MANUFACTURED GOODS ARE FANTASTIC CARS ARE AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING FOOD BUT ALSO OUR SERVICES WERE JUST EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR ECONOMY AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEIR JOBS
IN THIS COUNTRY I'M MEETING COMPANIES ALREADY TODAY EVERY WEEK I MEET COMPANY SINCE WE'VE ANNOUNCED THIS REFERENDUM THERE ARE PUTTING OFF INVESTMENT DECISIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHY IS IT THAT IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR YOU TWEETED
WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. FOR THE U.K. THE MET MEMBERSHIP CURRENTLY COSTS OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT THEN AND SAY THIS NOW
BECAUSE AT THAT TIME NO ONE KNEW WHAT THE FINAL DEAL WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD HAVE AND LOOK WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THIS RENEGOTIATION THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN PUT TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE ALSO TODAY WE HAVE IT WE HAVE ON WHAT DAVID CAMERON CAME BACK FROM BRUSSELS WITH AFTER THAT RENEGOTIATION THAT HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED AND AND AND AND THE SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE REFERENDUM WE HAVE FAR MORE DETAIL ON THE IMPACT SUCH AS THIS REPORT THAT'S COMING OUT THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS HAVE NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE
BUT ANYONE NOW YOU HAVE THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE I.M.F. THE O.E.C.D. THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS THE O.B. ARE THE AYAH FAIRS EVERYONE OF EVERY ONE OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS AND THAT IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THAT'S A CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE LEFT THE E.U. SAJID JAVID THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

K.P.M.G. AND THE LIGHT THEY WILL FACE QUESTIONS FROM M.P.S ON THE BUSINESS SELECT COMMITTEE
THE CHAIRMAN OF WHICH IS THE LABOUR M.P. IAN WRIGHT WHO IS HERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU COULD BE TALKING TO ADVICE IS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ARCADIA ULTIMATELY WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY FROM THOSE PEOPLE WAS IT TO MAKE SURE THAT RETAIL ACQUISITIONS WAS A SUITABLE BUYER OF B.H.S. ULTIMATELY IT'S THE DIRECTORS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND THE CHAIRMAN AS WELL AS THE FINANCE DIRECTOR IN TERMS OF
WHAT ROLE DID THEY HAVE REGARDING THE SALE OF B.H.S. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT WHAT WILL THE DIRECTORS DOING BUT OF COURSE THE NATURE OF THE ADVICE THAT THEY RECEIVED BOTH IN TERMS OF THE LEGAL ADVICE AND IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL ADVICE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL AND WE ALSO WANT TO ASK WHAT WORK DID YOU DO TO ENSURE THAT ACTUALLY WHO YOU WAS SELLING TWO WAS A REP REPUTABLE INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD TURN THE COMPANY AROUND WHO DO YOU SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE ADVICE WAS FLAWED
WE DON'T KNOW YET THAT'S THE QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL BE ASKING IN TERMS OF WHAT ADVICE DID WERE YOU GIVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO BE QUESTIONING THE ADVISORS THE ACCOUNTANTS AND LET LIES IN TERMS OF WHAT WERE YOU GIVING ADVICE AND WHAT INFORMATION ARE YOU BASING THAT ADVICE UPON THE CHAIRMAN LORD LA HAS ALREADY SAID THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED PUTTING B.H.S. INTO ADMINISTRATION BEFORE HE SOLD IT DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST THAT SEVILLE IT WAS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT B.H.S. HAD A VIABLE FUTURE
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT WE WANT TO FIND OUT FROM BLOOD GRAVEL OUT WHAT SORT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY HIMSELF IN TERMS OF WHAT QUESTIONS WERE ASKED GIVEN THAT HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IN TERMS OF HOW B.H.S. AS A COMPANY HAD THAT STEWARDSHIP WAS THAT STEWARDSHIP
EFFECTIVE IS THIS A FAILURE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND AS A RESULT ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE FACE LOSING THEIR JOBS TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE FACE LOSING PENSION ENTITLEMENTS AS WELL RIGHT YOU'RE ASKING LOTS OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE OF COURSE BEEN SOME STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY WHICH IRRITATED SPIRIT GREEN HE SAID THAT YOUR INQUIRY HAD A PREDETERMINED OUTCOME YOU'RE LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS THIS WAS TRIAL
BY MEDIA DO YOU REGRET SOME OF THOSE PREVIOUS COMMENT BY BETTER YOURSELF AND ALSO YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUE FRANK FEEL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PARLIAMENT ASKS THESE QUESTIONS AND THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS WRONG ANSWER WITH REGARDS TO THIS BOTH IN TERMS OF PHILIP GREEN IN TERMS OF THE WIDER ARCADIA GROUP AND THEN OF COURSE TODAY AT THE ADVISORS THAT WERE ADVISING THEM WE HAVEN'T JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS WHATSOEVER WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO THE ANSWERS FROM OUR QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT WHAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS O.K. THANK YOU IN RIGHT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOU'RE A CHILD AND LOCKED UP BY THE STATE HAS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU SPENT SOME OF YOUR LIFE BEING CARED FOR BY THE STATE AROUND HALF OF YOUNG PEOPLE HELD IN CUSTODY THE EQUIVALENT OF COURSE A PRISON FOR THE
ONCE IN CARE HAS DESPITE THE FACT THERE JUST ONE IN ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN ARE EVER PUT INTO CARE IN THE FIRST PLACE A PRISON REFORM TRUST REPORT OUT TODAY DESCRIBED THAT AS A TRAGIC WASTE OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEIR WASTE TO A PUBLIC MONEY THE REVIEW WAS CHAIRED BY THE CROSS BENCH PEER AND FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES LAW BLAMING YOU JOIN US ON THE LINE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NICK WHAT IS GOING WRONG HERE IS IT THE TWO OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE OR BEING CRIMINALISED VERY YOUNG
YES I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BEGIN BY RECOGNISING THAT WIN THE STATE TAKES SILVER THE PAIRING OF A CHILD OR YOUNG PERSON BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY NEGLECTED OR ABUSED THEN THE STATE HAS BOTH ILLEGAL AND IMMORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A GOOD PARENT TO THAT CHILD AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE IN THEIR EARLY LIFE
NO ONE SERVICE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH CHILD WHAT WHAT THE SUCCESS IS DEPENDS UPON EACH OF THE SERVICES COMING TOGETHER AND STOPPING THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL NOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS REPORT AND THE HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO IT BY OTHERS IS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED
POCKETS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SOCIAL CARE SERVICES CHILDREN'S SERVICES ARE WORKING VERY EFFECTIVELY WITH THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE LOCAL EDUCATION SERVICES WITH THE LOCAL POLICE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY HAVE COME TOGETHER TO RECOGNISE THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN CARE OR EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AND THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED
AND END OF END FURTHER EXPLOITATION NEEDS TO BE AVOIDED LET'S EXAMINE WHAT THAT MEANS IN A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE WE'RE HEARING EARLY FROM A CORRESPONDENCE SHOCKING EXAMPLE OF HOW A CHILD WHO'D STOLEN FOOD FROM THE FRIDGE A TEENAGER SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY MUST HE ETCHES WOULD EXPECT TO DO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIFE HAD BEEN CONFRONTED BY THE POLICE YES CAUTION
YES THAT IS APT IT RIGHT NICK WHAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN THIS REPORT IS THAT NOBODY IS WANTING TO MINIMISE THE FACT THAT SOME YOUNG PEOPLE DO SOME DREADFUL THINGS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THERE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM THE POLICE BEING CALLED IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IN A NORMAL FAMILY IN AN ORDINARY FAMILY THEY WILL BE DEALT WITH WITHIN THE FAMILY
AND THE GOOD THING IS THAT WHERE THE POLICE HAVE DEDICATED OFFICERS WHO ARE WORKING WELL WITH THE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S SERVICES THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER OFTEN CALL LOCATED TEAMS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR IT IS NECESSARY TO FOR THE POLICE TO BE INVOLVED THEY DON'T AUTOMATICALLY LOOKED FOR LOOK FOR A SCENE OF CRIME AND ESCALATING WHAT AS YOU SAY VERY WISELY WOULD BE A NORMAL FAMILY SITUATION
NOT TO ESCALATE THAT IN THE CRIMINAL JUST HALF OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT CHILDREN IN CARE ARE UP MOVED SO OFTEN SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY ARM OF THE STATE TO ACT LIKE A PARENT IF THEIR CHILD IS THERE FOR A MATTER OF MONTHS BEFORE BEING MOVED SOMEWHERE ELSE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE BECAUSE OF THAT IS FOR EACH CHILD A YOUNG PERSON THAT COMES IN THE CARE THERE IS A PROPER
CARE PLAN IN INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED CARE PLAN PUT INTO OPERATION WHERE IT IS NOT ABOUT FINDING A BED OR PUT IN A ROOF OVER THE YOUNG PERSON'S HEAD IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THEIR CARE NEEDS NOW THERE ARE SOME WONDERFUL EXAMPLES AROUND THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL WHERE THE NUMBER OF MOVEMENTS AS DROPPED IT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY
WHERE THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS DROPPED REALLY REMARKABLY AND I PAY TRIBUTE TO THOSE SERVICES THERE ARE WORKING SO WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS WHAT IS GOOD QUALITY SERVICE IN SOME PLACES BECOME STANDARD PRACTICE EVERYWHERE THIS IS THE CHALLENGE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THE TIMES TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN
HE MAY NOW NOT QUITE MATCH THE DRAMA OF HELEN GIVING BIRTH IN PRISON BUT MILLIONS OF LISTENERS TO THE ARCHERS MAY IDENTIFY A LITTLE MORE DIRECTLY WITH THE PLIGHT OF ANOTHER CHARACTER AT THIS TIME OF YEAR LINDA SNELL WHOSE PUNISHMENT IS SNEEZING AND ITCHY EYES LINDA OR MORE
TO BE MORE PRECISE THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYS HER CAROLE BOYD WILL BE AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW TODAY TO OPEN A SPECIALLY DESIGNED LOW ALLERGY GARDEN TO HELP HAYFEVER SUFFERERS LIKE HER AND WE JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE DESIGNER OF THAT GARDEN DOCTOR JOANNA SHELDON IS AN IMMUNOLOGIST FROM SAINT GEORGE'S HOSPITAL AND ALSO BY ANDY DOUBT A PROFESSIONAL GARDENER WHO SUFFERS FROM THE DREADED SNEEZING AND ITCHING MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU
GOOD MORNING DOCTOR JEAN FOR THOSE NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO TO CHELSEA IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO JUST DESCRIBE THIS GARDEN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WELL WE PUT TOGETHER A SMALL GARDEN THAT REALLY CONTAINS PLANTS THAT ARE INSECT POLLINATED SO WE DON'T HAVE LOTS OF HIGH POLLEN THAT CAN FLY
SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGY THAT WE ALL OVER IT SHE LIES THE SNEEZING BREATHING DIFFER
HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE TREES THAT ARE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S GARDEN
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS MINIMISE WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR OWN GARDEN THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE YOU WERE ALLERGIC
YOU DOUGHTY IS SOMEONE WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL GARDENER DO YOU THINK THIS IS ONE SOLUTION FOR HAYFEVER SUFFERERS WHO NEVERTHELESS LOVE TO BE IN THEIR GARDENS
YES IT SOUNDS LIKE IT EMERGED TO GRASS POLLEN SO IT'S A BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET AROUND IT
I'M EXPOSED TO IT ALL THE TIME WHEREVER A GUYS YOU TOLERATED IN OTHER WORDS THIS CASE OF HAVING TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE THINKING SHALL I UP AND MY GARDEN AND WATCH LIE VOID WE WERE HERE IN THERE ABOUT INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS BEING IN THERE WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE WELL I'M NOT REALLY AN EXPERT ON THAT SORT OF THING OF THE GROUNDS MAINTENANCE
BASICALLY THIS TIME HERE ON JUST CUT IN ACRES AND ACRES OF GRASS FOR ME THAT IS ALLERGIC TO GRASS CUTS GRACE FOR OTHER YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IS A TREASON NEWS ALERTED TO TREES THAT'S CAUSES PROBLEMS FOR HIM AS WELL SIR AND THAT POSES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES A PROFESSIONAL GARDENER DOESN'T IT WHICH IS IF YOU TAKE ANTIHISTAMINES THEY MAKE YOU DROWSY NOT TERRIBLY SAFE HAVE YOU GOT
NO OF GIVEN UP ON TABLETS AND THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE QUITE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ME ABOUT ME QUITE GROWN FOR YOU WHEN I GET MY END UP FALLING ASLEEP ON THE SETTEE DOCTOR SEAN'S GOING TO ADVISE YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO INSTEAD DOCTOR SHELDON GIVE HIM A TIP IF YOU WERE DESIGNING A GARDEN FOR ANDY OR ANYBODY ELSE LISTENING IS AVE THE SUFFERER GIVE HIM A FEW MORE TIPS AS TO WHAT THEY CAN DO
THE KIND OF PLANTS THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE A THINGS LIKE HOSTAS AND ANGIE RHINO WITH BEGONIAS CAMELLIAS CLEMATIS THOSE SORTS OF PLANTS PLANTS THAT YOU YOU KNOW THAT YOU SEE INSECTS GOING TITS INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS HAVE THE BEST ONES TO GO
AND IN TERMS OF MANAGING YOUR ALLERGY SYMPTOMS THE BEST THING TO DO
IS TO TO TRY AND START LIKE ANTI ALLERGY MEDICATION EITHER THE TABLETS ALL THE THE NASAL SPRAYS BEFORE THE SEASONS
THINGS LIKE LOOKING AT THE POLLEN COUNT AND LOOKING AT THE
THE POLLEN CALENDAR MIGHT HELP YOU DECIDE WHEN YOU SHOULD START TAKING YOUR MEDICATION AND A LITTLE BIT OF MEDICATION EVERY DAY PROBABLY BETTER THAN WAITING FOR YOUR SYMPTOMS TO BECOME ESTABLISHED AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH THEM AND HOW FAR DOES IT HELP
PUT ON A PAIR OF SPECS ARE A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES WHERE EVEN A FACE MASK TO AVOID THAT POLLEN GETTING INTO YOUR NOSE AND YOUR EYES EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS SO WRAPAROUND SUNGLASSES ARE VERY HELPFUL BUT OTHER THINGS LIKE
DON'T HANG YOUR WASHING OUT ON THE WASHING LINE COS THE POLLEN CAN GET STUCK INTO THE WASHING AND THEN WHEN YOU BRING IT IN AND WHERE IT ALL SLEEP ON IT THEN YOU CAN CONTINUE THAT EXPOSURE TO THE EMPTY OF APOLLO
CERTAINLY LOOK AT THE POLLEN CALENDAR AND TRY AND USE YOUR ACTIVITIES DO YOUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE DAY WHEN THE POLLEN IS AT THE LOWEST NOT DURING THE HIGH POLLEN
TIMES OF THE DAY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND LAST THING AT NIGHT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE TIPS CAN CAN REALLY DIMINISH YOUR SYMPTOMS THERE WE ARE AND HE CAN KEEP THE JOB IF YOU WEAR WRAPAROUND SUNGLASSES AND MO AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE DAY THAT'S IT GOOD TONIGHT YOU OBVIOUSLY LOVE THE GARDEN ENOUGH TO TOLERATE THIS HORROR
WELL I'VE HAD ABOUT ALL MY LIFE SO WHETHER I DID THE JOB OR NOT I'D STILL BE GETTING IT SO IT'S JUST A CASE OF GETTING THROUGH IT AND IT'S ONLY FOR ABOUT SIX WEEKS OF THE YEAR IN THAT'S STATE HOW CAN ENJOY THE REST OF THE SUN WITHOUT YOU AND LINDA SELL ANDY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DOCTOR JOINED
IT'S NOT TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GUYS BACK WITH US AND GARY MORNING WITH ENGLAND'S FIRST MATCH AT THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS FAST APPROACHING THE LIMBERED UP WINNING THE FIRST OF THREE WARM UP GAMES TO ONE AGAINST TURKEY JAMIE WABI AND HURRICANE SCORED THE GOALS CAME ALSO MISSED A PENALTY MORE IN AN HOUR
IN THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS MANCHESTER UNITED WILL CONFIRM THE APPOINTMENT OF JUST SAY MARINE EEL AS THEIR NEW MANAGER MARIE KNEW OF COURSE HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS AND IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE HE HAS THE BEST WIN PERCENTAGE OF ANY MANAGER BUT WHAT ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR THE REGULAR TOUCHLINE EXPLOSIONS HE'S OUT SPANK SPOKEN COMMENTS IN INTERVIEWS HE WAS EVEN BANNED BY THE F.A. FROM ATTENDING THE CHELSEA GAME LAST SEASON I FOLK SPOKE TO FORMER UNITED PLAYER PHIL NEVILLE ABOUT THE MARINE IMAGE
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD CHANGE BECAUSE JOSIE IS WHAT HE IS E. E. IS CONFRONTATIONAL HE DOES LIKE TO CREATE A SIEGE MENTALITY FOR HIS TEAM'S HE'S DONE EVERYWHERE HE GOT THESE HE'S NOT HE DIDN'T CHANGE AT REAL MADRID HE WAS THE SAME AT PORT IT WAS THE SAME AT CHELSEA INTER MILAN IT'S THE WAY HE GOES ABOUT MANAGEMENT AND
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH HIS RECORD IS FANTASTIC HE'S ONE TROLL FACES IS A SERIAL WINNER OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS A SERIAL WINNERS OATH OF FLEA CHAMPIONSHIPS AND I THINK I THINK FROM A MANCHESTER UNITED POINT OF VIEW IT'S IT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO BE THEY WANT TO BE CHALLENGING POLICE TITLES AGAIN OR YOU KNOW MANY OF THE MANCHESTER UNITED PLAYERS WELL HOW WILL THEY REACT TO THE APPOINTMENT PLAYERS QUICKLY FORM AN OPINION OF A MANAGER
I'M SURE I'M SURE OVER THE NEXT MONTH THEY'LL BE RINGING IN THE MATES IN FOOTBALL THEY'VE PLAYED WITH JOBS THAT OF PROBABLY PLAYED AT CHELSEA AND THERE'LL BE ASKING ALL ABOUT HIM BECAUSE AS IT IS IN TERMS OF REPUTATION I THINK YOU LOOK AT THE CHELSEA PLAYERS THE ALL SPEAK SO FONDLY
OF PLEASURE OR CRYING WHEN HE LEFT INTO ONE SO I THINK HE HAS HE HAS A TIGHT BOND WITH HIS PLAYERS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN TERRY IN FRONT ONE PARTY AS A TIGHT BOND AND THEY'LL BE EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH HIM AND I JUST THINK THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR THE FIRST DAY OF PRE SEASON AND ACTUALLY START HIT HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
TO START THE SEASON FINALLY MARINI A WHILE A GREAT SUCCESS OFTEN MOVES ON QUICKLY WHAT REASON IS THERE TO THINK HE'LL STAY AT OLD TRAFFORD FOR A LONG TIME DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE A SUCCESS
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT I THINK YOU WILL BE A SUCCESS DO I THINK HE'LL STAY FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME OF A VENGA EVER SIR ALEX FERGUSON I DON'T I THINK FOOTBALL MANAGEMENT HAS CHANGED THE SCRUTINY THE PRESSURE THE DEMANDS OF A TOP MANAGER NOW ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO STAY IN THE GAME FOR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AT ONE CLUB SO I THINK HISTORY WILL TELL YOU HE HE STAYS IN ONE CLUB FOR TWO OR THREE SEASONS WINS TROPHIES WINGS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE AND THEN GETS OUT AND I THINK I THINK AT MANCHESTER IT'LL BE NO DIFFERENT

EVERYBODY NORMALLY IF YOU COMES WHEN THE COUNTRIES ARE FAUNA HAS TWENTY SHOWS PAST PURCHASE IT WERE HIM AND THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN IF IF PRESIDENT HER FUR IS CONFIRMED TODAY IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN EUROPEAN POLITICS ALL NO NO NO NONE OF THIS IS WHAT WE THINK OF PEOPLE BUT
TO MAKE KEEP PEOPLE SCARED TO MAKE EUROPE'S CARED ABOUT MY WHOLE FOOT IN MOST OF IT A VERY MODERATE MAN HE'S A VERY MODERN MEN HE EXPLAINED SOME ODD TIMES TO DISCUSSION PRINTING IN THE RED AND EXPLAIN SOME OF THAT THIS ISN'T IT WON'T COME OUT LIKE YOUR THIS IS THE LAST THING IF THE GOVERNMENT
BUT SECRETLY DON'T EXCEPT WERE EXCEPTING BREAKING ASKED YOU AND LAW AND NATIONAL LOT LISTENING TO THAT A EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ADLER HE'S A VERY MODERATE MAN SAYS MY OATH AS FRIEND I SIMPLY WANTS TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION SO WHAT ON EARTH IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT
WELL HIS CRITICS IN AN OUTSIDE AUSTRIA SEE AND BUT HOFFA AND HIS PARTY AS PART OF A CREEPING EUROPEAN RIGHT WING POPULIST THREAT THEY SAY MY HOOFER HE'S A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING THE FRIENDLY FACE OF THE FAR RIGHT WHO AUSTRIANS LIKE TO SAY IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S FAVOURITE SUB SOME SMOOTH TALKING HIS COUNTRY'S HARD LINES BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAD BEEN A KEY ARCHITECT IN THE FREEDOM PS PARTIES MAKEOVER
WHICH HIS CRITICS SAY HE'S CYNICAL AND SINISTER THEY'VE DUMPED THOSE PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT PRAISED THE NAZIS THEY GOT TO THE PARTY'S FORMER LEADER EURK HIDER INTO TROUBLE AND THEY'VE REBRANDED AND MODERNISE THE PARTY THEY ARE VERY MUCH ANGLING FOR THE DISCONTENTED VOTERS OF THE POLITICAL CENTRE NOW SO A SIZEABLE CHUNK OF THEIR ACTUALLY SEE THEM AS A PLAIN TALKING PARTY OF THE PEOPLE
IT'S NO LONGER A SOCIAL STIGMA TO SAY THAT YOU VOTE FOR THEM AND INCREASINGLY IN AUSTRIA AND ACROSS EUROPE VOTING FOR THE POPULIST RIGHT IS NOT ASSOCIATED ANY MORE WITH FAR RIGHT IDEOLOGY OR SYMPATHISING WITH THE NAZIS AND THEIR CRITICS OF COURSE EH THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HOW SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT IS THAT THREAT THAT THE PRESIDENT TO PRESUMABLY A LOT OF THE TIME HE'S SORT OF OPENING FUNCTIONS AND FETES AND BALLS SAYS I MIGHT DISMISS THE GOVERNMENT IF I DON'T LIKE THEIR IMMIGRATION POLICY
ANOTHER HOOFER MADE WHAT'S NOW VERY FAMOUS STATEMENT IN ONE OF HIS TELEVISION INTERVIEWS IN WHICH HE SAID YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT I CAN DO WHEN I GET TO POWER FROM THERE IT'S A SYMBOLIC ROLE OF COURSE IT EVERYBODY WHO CRITICISES HIM SEES THAT AS AS A NOT VERY VEILED THREAT HE CAN DISMISS THE GOVERNMENT HE HAS SAID THOUGH THAT HE IS VERY UNLIKELY TO DO SO ANOTHER THINK HE SAID HE'D LIKE TO DO IS TO GO ALONG THERE TO BRUSSELS TO E.U. MEETINGS AND MAKE SURE THAT DECISIONS ARE MADE
IN HIS COUNTRY'S INTEREST THE FREEDOM PARTY SAYS THAT IT'S ADMIRES THE U.K. IT SAYS WHICH IT BELIEVES PUSHES NATIONAL INTERESTS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTACTS SO YOU YOU WILL EXPECT HIM IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT TO PUSH BEHIND THE LINES BUT ACTUALLY HE AND HIS PARTY ALREADY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE GENERAL ELECTION IN AUSTRIA THEY ARE POLLING AT THE MOMENT
AS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST PARTY AND WHETHER OR NOT HE BECOMES PRESIDENT TODAY THEY WILL SEE THIS AS A HUGE SUCCESS FOR THE PARTY WHICH IF YOU REMEMBER SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN HE FIRST JOINED A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THERE WAS A MASSIVE OUTCRY IN AUSTRIA AND ABROAD AND E.U. COUNTRIES ISOLATED AUSTRIA AND NOW
THE FREEDOM PARTY IS PART OF A EUROPEAN TREND AT THIS ANTI ESTABLISHMENT TOE NATIONALIST EUROSCEPTIC MIGRANT CURBING THE FACT THAT IT CALLS ITSELF A PARTY OF THE PEOPLE YOU SEE MOVEMENTS LIKE THAT IN GERMANY ITALY FRANCE THE U.K. DENMARK SWEDEN I MEAN I COULD GO ON AND JUST OTHER IF LEADERS HAVE HAVE RUSHED TO TO CONGRATULATE HIM LIKE LE PEN IN FRANCE REALLY VERY FINAL ONE OF YOU WOULD CATCH A HOTSY AUSTRIA IN WITH THAT SORT OF POLITICS VOTING FOR TURKEY TO JOIN THE E. WAS AND IT WAS RATHER RELEVANT TO THAT ABOUT JUST NOW
IT IS RELEVANT TO THE DEBATE RIGHT NOW BUT BUT MOST LEADERS OF MOST E.U. COUNTRIES WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S AN EXTREMELY FAR OFF PROSPECTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF THESE RIGHT WING POPULIST NOT JUST AUSTIN ACROSS EUROPE THIS IS NOT THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN WHICH
TURKEY WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO THE E.U. NOT NOW CATCHER ADLER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS IN THE TELEGRAPH THE TIMES AND THE FINANCIAL TIMES LEAD ON THE PREDICTION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR THAT LEAVING THE E.U.

ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY A SPEAKER AND A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING THE REVEREND DOCTOR JANE LEECH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO BECKETT WEEK SO BRANDED BY THE HUNGARIAN EMBASSY TO MARK THE ARRIVAL IN LONDON TODAY HAVE A RELIC OF SAINT THOMAS BECKET'S FROM ESTHER IN HUNGRY WHERE IT HAS BEEN VENERATED FOR EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS
THIS FRAGMENT OF BECKET'S MARTYRED BODY WILL BE DISPLAYED AND CELEBRATED BEFORE AT THE END OF THE WEEK BEING TRANSFERRED TO CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL WHERE HE WAS MURDERED IN ELEVEN SEVENTY
CHAUCER AND T.S. ELIOT HAVE MADE BECKET A WELL KNOWN FIGURE WITH EVENTS THIS WEEK INVOLVING THE PRESIDENT OF HUNGRY TOGETHER WITH THE ARCHBISHOPS OF WESTMINSTER IN CANTERBURY AT SUCH HIGH PROFILE VENUES AS THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY YOU MIGHT BE FORGIVEN FOR ASKING WHAT'S GOING ON
ACCORDING TO THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR THE DEVOTION TO SAINT THOMAS IN HUNGRY DEMONSTRATES THE DEEP CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL LINKS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES SO PERHAPS THOMAS IS BEING PRESSED INTO SERVICE TO BIND TOGETHER THE ANCIENT MATRONS OF EUROPE PERHAPS THE CURRENT APPEAL OF HUNGARY'S BECKETT IS THE WAY IN WHICH HE BECAME A SYMBOL FOR THE RESISTANCE OF THE CHURCH TO THE LIMITATIONS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SUFFERED UNDER THE COMMUNIST REGIME
OR PERHAPS THE REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN PILGRIMAGES AND SHRINES MORE GENERALLY REPRESENTS A REACTION AGAINST THE GLOBALISATION OF CULTURE AND A YEARNING FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE PARTICULARITY OF PLACE IS THIS WHY THE LAST PART OF THE JOURNEY TO CANTERBURY ON SATURDAY WILL BE DONE ON FOOT
PILGRIMAGE ON FOOT IT'S SOMETHING I LEARNT ABOUT AS I WALK THE FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE PYRENEES TO SANTIAGO DE COMPOS STELLA IN NORTH WEST SPAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX EN ROUTE I MET PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS FOR SOME IT WAS THE RELICS THAT MATTERED THOSE PHYSICAL REMAINS OF A SAINTLY PERSON IN HIS PRESENCE THEY HOPE TO BECOME WHOLE AGAIN WHETHER IN BODY MIND OR SPIRIT
FOR SOME THE SHRINE WAS A PLACE IN ELLIOT'S WORDS WHERE PRAYER HAS BEEN VALID
FOR OTHERS THIS WAS SPORT OR EXERCISE OR THE FULFILMENT OF A PERSONAL GOAL WAS FOR MANY THE JOURNEY PROVIDED TIME OUT FROM HER FRENETIC WORLD TO LIVE AT WALKING PACE TO ADJUST TO A LIFE CHANGE TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION
LOST A PILGRIMAGE MAY BE UNDERTAKEN ALONE AND FOR ONE'S OWN REASONS I LEARNED IN SPAIN THOUGH BUT IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE YOU COME TO RELY ON FELLOW PILGRIMS FOR DIRECTIONS FOR MEDICAL SUPPLIES FOR COMPANY
WHILST WE BEGAN BY SHARING THE THINGS HAPPENING TO US AS WE NEARED OUR DESTINATION WE STARTED TO SHARE ALSO THE THINGS HAPPENING IN US THOSE DEEP THINGS AT THE HEART OF LIFE THAT SOMETIMES STRUGGLED TO FIND A PLACE THINGS TO DO WITH MEANING AND VALUE WITH DEATH WITH LOVE
SPECULATION WILL CONTINUE THIS WEEK ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESSION OF THIS RELIC MEANS RATHER THAN PUZZLING OVER IN THE ABSTRACT THOUGH MY ADVICE WOULD BE GO AND WALK JOIN IN WITH THE COMMITTED AND THE CURIOUS THE CATHOLICS AND THE ANGLICANS THE HUNGARIANS AND THE BRITS AND WALK FROM HARBOUR DOWN TO CANTERBURY IN THE STEPS OF THAT RAGBAG OF PILGRIMS FROM CHAUCER'S FAMOUS TALES
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU AND HE KNEW AND AMONGST IT ALONG THE WAY
THAT WAS FOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR JANE LEECH TIME NOW IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EAT YET AGAIN IN MARCH THE GOVERNMENT SET OUT ITS OFFICIAL ADVICE ON HEALTHY EATING CUT DOWN ON FULL FAT FOOD BASED YOUR MEALS AROUND STARCHY FOOD SUCH AS PASTA POTATOES OR RICE THE NATIONAL BEASTIE FORM IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COLLABORATION SAY THAT IS WRONG AND IN THE WORDS OF THE HEART DOCTOR DOCTOR ARE SEEN MALHOTRA
IT IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IN MODERN MEDICAL HISTORY BECAUSE IT IS RESULTING IN DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NAMELY OBESITY AND TYPE TWO DIABETES WHERE WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR MALHOTRA IN WESTMINSTER AND FROM SHREWSBURY BY SOMEONE WHO ADVISES THE GOVERNMENT ON A BEASTIE PROFESSOR SUSAN JEBB PROFESSOR OF DARTING POPULATION HEALTH AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DOCTOR MALHOTRA WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE OFFICIAL ADVICE I THINK LET'S LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THERE SO WE'VE GOT THIS MESSAGE THAT HAS DEMONISE FATS IN WHICH HAS DOMINATED DARCH ADVICE SINCE CHANGIN ADVICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND PREVIOUS TO THAT IN AMERICAN I'M SEVENTY SEVEN AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AND THIS IS BASED UPON FLAWED SCIENCE WE KNOW NOW IT'S RESULTED IN PEOPLE CHOOSING OR EATING MORE REFINED CARBOHYDRATES AND SUGAR IN PARTICULAR
WE LOOK AT THE TOTALITY THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM IS IT DRIVES PEOPLE AWAY FROM EATING COLD NUTRITIOUS FOODS WHICH INCLUDE YOU KNOW OILY FISH OLIVE OIL NUTS YOU KNOW AND EGGS FOR EXAMPLE SO PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING HIS LOFAR OPTIONS IN THERE'S A HUGE INDUSTRY THAT HAS DEVELOPED WHETHER IT'S MOCKING OF DRUGS TO LOCAL ASTRAL BONE SPECIFICALLY LOW FAT FOODS ARE LOADED WITH SUGAR PROCESSED FOODS AND THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN QUITE DEVASTATING IN PARTICULAR FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK ALL HAVE TYPE TWO DIABETES CLUE THAT THIS IS A CONDITION
UNTIL MANY YEARS AGO WAS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO A CONDITION OF CARBOHYDRATE INTOLERANCE AND WHAT'S WHAT WE MENTION IN OUR REPORT IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A G. P. UP UP NORTH CALLED DAVID UNWIN WHO'S WON AN N.H.S. INNOVATION AWARD WHO HAS GONE AGAINST CONVENTIONAL ADVICE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE PROBLEM FOR FOR HIS PATIENTS WHO HAVE TYPE TWO DIABETES OR RISK A TOUCH OF DIABETES AND WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS AND YOU KNOW HE'S ADVISED THEM TO REDUCE HER REFINED CARBS AND SUGAR AND JUST EAT UNTIL YOUR FALL WHICH IS
BASICALLY I FOLLOW MY OWN ADVICE TO DO THE SAME THING AND WHAT'S EXTRAORDINARY IS HE'S MANAGED TO REVERSE TYPE TWO DIABETES MANY OF HIS PATIENTS AND ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR MEDICATION SO THIS ADVICE UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS HAS ACTUALLY LOVE YOU CAUSED HARM A PROFESSOR SUSAN JEBB BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT THE PROBLEM WITH ADVISING PEOPLE TO EAT LOW FAT THINGS IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LOADED WITH SUGARS
I THINK MOST PEOPLE NOW RECOGNISE THAT A BE SETTEE HAS INCREASED BECAUSE FOOD IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IT'S RELATIVELY CHEAP IT'S IN LARGE PORTIONS QUITE SIMPLY WE ARE EATING TOO MUCH IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE ADVICE THAT HAD A SCENE IS OFFERING THAT YOU SHOULD EAT AS MUCH UNREFINED CARB AS YOU WANT AND IT'S MUCH SATURATED FAT AS YOU WISH WILL HELP PEOPLE TO LOSE WEIGHT
IT'S ALSO A BIT STRANGE FOR HIM TO TALK ABOUT THE TOTALITY OF THE EVIDENCE ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH IS MAKING SO MANY SCIENTISTS SO VERY CROSS THIS MORNING ABOUT THIS REPORT IS IT CHERRY PICKS THE STUDY HERE AND THERE WHICH SUPPORTS THIS VIEW THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TAKEN FROM GOOD HIGH QUALITY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS WHICH PUT ALL THE EVIDENCE TOGETHER I'M AFRAID DOES NOT IN ANY WAY
SUPPORT THE ASSERTION THAT YOU SHOULD BE EATING MORE SATURATED FAT DOCTOR ASSUME A HOTTER YOUR CHERRY PICKING EVIDENCE I THINK THAT'S COMPLETE AND TOTAL NON SCENE THERE ARE ONLY FIVE AT THE PREFERENCE IS IN YOUR IN YOUR LIST OF FORTY WHICH IS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF THE ACCEPTED WAY OF GATHERING EVIDENCE O.K. LEILA LOOKS LIKE DAUGHTER MALHOTRA COME COME BACK ON THAT YOU HAVE NOT SHOWN YOUR REFERENCES YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE CLAIMING IS UNSUPPORTED THAT'S ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT THAT IS A COMPLETE UNTRUTH
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT TO USE IS ACTUALLY THE MOST RECENT HIGH QUALITY EVIDENT EVEN CAME TO MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DID A VERY LARGE STUDY LOOKING THIS PUBLISHING THE ANNALS OF MEDICINE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LOOKING OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND LOOKS OF SATURATED FAT SPECIFICALLY PARTIES BUT CAN I MAKE ONE POINT HERE TO PROFESSOR JOB WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU CAN CONSUME AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE WE'RE SAYING WE'RE SAYING SATURATED FAT DOES NOT CAUSE HEART DISEASE AND IF YOU FOLLOW FOLLOWED DIETARY PATTERN IN THAT'S VERY CLEAR WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL SUPPORT THIS
COMPARED TO LOW FAT LOW FAT MESSAGE THERE IS ACTUALLY IS BETTER FOR WEIGHT LOSS AND IN FACT THE OTHER THING I MUST MENTION AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT VERY VERY QUICKLY I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR PROFESSOR JAB BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM OF COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE BY SEA VIEWS OF ACADEMICS AND SHE HAS TAKEN FUNDING FROM WEIGHT WATCHERS COCA COLA I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS HAS BY MY RESEARCH HAS ONE STUDY WAS FUNDED BY COCA COLA WE SHOWED THE PRODUCT DIDN'T WORK WE'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE I'VE SEEN YOUR REPORT SAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN SCAN
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEIGHT LOSS INCLUDE ADDLE A BIT AND THAT'S FREELY LES REFINED CARBOHYDRATE AND HIGH FAT DIET HASN'T EXCEPT JUST A VERY LIVE AND WE'RE VERY BRIEFLY PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS WILL BE THINKING WHAT DO I DO WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ADVICE IN THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HAVING AN EFFECT ON WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO THE NATION WE ARE ALL GETTING FATTER AND TYPE TWO DIABETES IS GOING UP
THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE ARE NOT MEETING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY ABOUT FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE MEET THEIR DATA RECOMMENDATIONS ON THERE'S VERY GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THOSE WHO DO HAVE A LOWER BODY WEIGHT AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES WE NEED TO SUPPORT PEOPLE TO MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES ON THE DIET THAT DOES INCLUDE CUTTING DOWN AND SUGAR IT BUT ALSO INCLUDES CUTTING DOWN ON SATURATED FAT PEOPLE NEED REAL HELP AND THIS KIND OF CONFUSION
DOESN'T MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE BUT LET ME SUSAN JEBB AND DOCTOR A SEA MALHOTRA THANK YOU BAITH TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST HE'S JOE WENT THANKS NICK GOOD MORNING AND IT'S A DRY AND BRIGHT START TO THE DAY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY HAD SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE THERE IS A BIT OF THICKER CLOUD ACROSS SOME EASTERN OR WESTERN AREAS BRINGING THE ODD SPOT OF RAIN BUT FOR MANY PLACE IT'S A LOVELY START TO THE DAY AT CLOUD AMOUNTS WILL BE SLOWLY INCREASING INTO THE AFTERNOON WE WILL SEE SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPING
AND IN SCOTLAND I THINK SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED INLAND SO AROUND THE COASTS MOSTLY FINE AND DRY SOME SPELLS OF SUNSHINE FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT THE SHOWERS COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY BUT AWAY FROM THOSE SIXTY SEVENTY DEGREES AND SPELLS OF SUNSHINE NORTHERN IRELAND SLIGHTLY DRY ACTUALLY FOR MUCH OF THE DAY NOT MANY SHOWERS HERE PRETTY DECENT FOR THE DAY WITH SOME SPELLS OF SUNSHINE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES AND NOT PARTICULARLY WINDY EITHER
ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES WELL A LOT OF FINE DRY WEATHER AT THE MOMENT BUT THE CLOUD AMOUNTS WILL BE INCREASING LATE MORNING EARLY AFTERNOON AND A GOOD SCATTERING OF SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP MAINLY ACROSS THE SPINE OF ENGLAND AND PARTS OF WALES AS WELL SEEING A FEW SHOWERS BUT I THINK THE WESTERN SIDE OF WALES THAT'S WHAT THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND LARGELY FINE AND DRY WITH SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AND MANY EASTERN COASTAL COUNTIES ALSO DOING QUITE WELL MOST OF THE SHOWERS BREAKING OUT IN LANTERN TOWARDS THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND MAYBE DOWN TOWARDS THE ISLE OF WIGHT AS WELL
AND AGAIN SOME OF THE SHOWERS COULD BE HEAVY AND THUNDERY SO TAKE CARE IF YOU'RE ON THE ROADS A TOP TEMPERATURES IN THE SUNNY SPELLS AROUND ABOUT NINETEEN OR TWENTY DEGREES AND OVERALL TUESDAY LOOKS LIKE A MUCH BETTER DAY JUST A FEW SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH WEST BUT MOST OF US TO BE FINE AND DRY THANKS VERY MUCH JAY THIS EVENING GENDER IS ON THE AGENDA ON RADIO FOUR
THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS FEELING OF I DON'T WANT TO BE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A GIRL AND THEN I SORT OF FOUND THE TERM NON BINARY AND I KIND OF HAD A BIT OF A LIGHT BULB MOMENT THE NEW SERIES OF ANALYSIS BEGINS WITH A LOOK AT THOSE WHO REJECT BOTH MALE AND FEMALE IDENTITIES THERE FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO LOOK LIKE AND WHAT KIND OF MASCULINITY AND FEMININITY THEY WANT TO EMBRACE OR REJECT SO THE CUTTER TRYING OUT IDENTITIES OH DEFINITELY
ANALYSIS BEYOND BINARY THIS EVENING AT EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR
COMING UP IN THE NEXT OW WALLY SIR THOMAS BECKET'S ELBOW IS COMING BACK TO ENGLAND AFTER CENTURIES ABROAD AND WE'LL BE TALKING TO PRISONER BOMBERS TOP MAN ON CYBER SECURITY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY THE HEADLINES WITH A MONTH TO GO TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT IS TO WARN THAT VOTING TO LEAVE WOULD CAUSE A RECESSION AND THE LOSS OF HALF A MILLION JOBS ARE REPORTED SUGGESTED WAYS TO PREVENT CHILDREN IN CARE BEING DRAWN INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INSURANCE COMPANIES GETTING RID OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY AND CAMPAIGNERS HAVE CLASHED WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS OVER RECENTLY UPDATED GUIDELINES ON HEALTHY EATING THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY DIANA SPEED
THE TREASURY WILL WARM THAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF HALF A MILLION JOBS IT'S ANALYSIS BEING PUBLISHED TODAY SAYS BRITAIN WOULD PLUNGE INTO A YEAR LONG RECESSION AND GROWTH WOULD FALL BY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS DESCRIBED SUCH AN IMPACT AS A DO IT YOURSELF RECESSION LIVE CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DISMISSED THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE FORECAST AS UNJUSTIFIED AND INVALID ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
ALTHOUGH THE REPORT HAS YET TO BE PUBLISHED ITS BROAD CONCLUSIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN RELEASED PAINT A BLEAK PICTURE OUTSIDE THE SINGLE MARKET GROWTH COULD BE UP TO SIX PER CENT LOWER THE POUND DOWN BY FIFTEEN PER CENT HOUSE PRICE RISES CUT BY EIGHTEEN PERCENT AND UP TO HALF A MILLION JOBS LOST AT THE SAME TIME THE COST OF HOLIDAYS SHOP PRICES AND MORTGAGES WOULD ALL RISE
WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHANCELLOR SAY THE EVIDENCE IS UNEQUIVOCAL LEAVING WOULD PUT THE ECONOMY IN SERIOUS DANGER AND MAKE THE COUNTRY PERMANENTLY POORER AND SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGEY JAVID DESCRIBED THEIR TREASURIES ANALYSIS AS VERY VERY CONVINCING
THIS IS A SERIOUS SO WERE ANALYSIS AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY BUT THE VOTE IS GOING TO BE IN EXACTLY A MONTHS' TIME FROM NOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DECISION OF A LIFETIME'S MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE STILL UNDECIDED AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS REPORT PROVIDES
BRECHT SAID CAMPAIGNERS HOWEVER HAVE DISMISSED THE REPORT AS FANTASTICAL IAIN DUNCAN SMITH SAID IT WAS NOT HONEST AND BORIS JOHNSON DESCRIBED WARNINGS OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL AS A GIANT HOAX WITH THE TWO SIDES SO FAR APART ON THE BASIC ARGUMENTS AROUND THE ECONOMY IT'S A REFERENDUM WHICH MAY TURN AS MUCH ON CREDIBILITY AND TWO VOTERS CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
STEVE HILTON THE ADVISERS WHO PLAYED A BIG PART IN MAKING DAVID CAMERON'S POLITICAL APPROACH SEEM DISTINCTIVE HAS SAID HE NOW FAVOURS LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION MY HILTONS AS THE AMOUNT OF BUREAUCRACY COMING OUT OF BRUSSELS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GOVERN BRITAIN PROPERLY BUT A SENIOR CONSERVATIVE M.P. HAS CRITICISED LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS FOR MISUSING STATISTICS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT TOM BATEMAN REPORTS
AS A FORMER DOWNING STREET STRATEGY DIRECTOR STEVE HILTON DRAWS ON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHITEHALL MACHINERY TO ATTACK WHAT HE SEES AS THE UNMANAGEABLE INFLUENCE OF THE E.U. BUREAUCRACY WRITING IN THE DAILY MAIL HE ALSO DESCRIBES AS MODEST THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN HIS RENEGOTIATION OF BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP BUT SAYS BRUSSELS OFFICIALS WERE ARROGANT AND DISMISSIVE OF THEM
DOWNING STREET HAS PREVIOUSLY REJECTED CRITICISM OF THE DEAL SAYING IT GAVE BRITAIN A SPECIAL STATUS IN THE MEANWHILE THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. SARAH WERE LISTON HAVING PREVIOUSLY SAID SHE WAS INCLINED TO VOTE TO LEAVE HAS CRITICISED THE BRECHT'S IT CAMP WHAT SHE CALLED THE ABSURD CLAIM BUT QUITTING THE E.U. COULD DIVERT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO THE N.H.S. SHE SAID BOTH CAMPAIGNS HAD MADE DISINGENUOUS AND DOWNRIGHT MISLEADING CLAIMS
A REVIEW IS CALLING FOR A NEW APPROACH TOWARDS CHILDREN IN CARE WHO COMMIT MINOR CRIMES LORD LAMINGTON A FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES SAYS THE CURRENT SITUATION IS A TRAGIC WASTE OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES AND PUBLIC MONEY IS CALLING FOR THE POLICE AND PROSECUTORS TO BE MORE LENIENT AS A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ALISON HOLT REPORTS
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN CARE DON'T GET INTO TROUBLE BUT ABOUT HALF OF THE ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAVE SPENT SOME TIME IN FOSTER CARE OR CHILDREN'S HOMES THIS YEAR LONG REVIEW COMMISSIONED BY THE PRISON REFORM TRUST HIGHLIGHTS THE DAMAGING EFFECT OF THE FREQUENT CHANGES TO WHERE CHILDREN IN CARE LIVE GO TO SCHOOL AND THE HIGH TURNOVER OF SOCIAL WORKERS SUPPORTING THEM
IT CALLS FOR THE POLICE TO BE ALLOWED TO RECORD LOW LEVEL BAD BEHAVIOUR IN A WAY THAT MEANS THE CHILDREN GET HELP RATHER THAN A CRIMINAL RECORD IT ALSO SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EARLY SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SEEN AS AT RISK LORD CLAIMING TOLD US THAT WHEN THE STATE TOOK OVER THE CARE OF A CHILD OR YOUNG PERSON IT HAD A LEGAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A GOOD PARENT
NO ONE SERVICE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH CHILD SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON EACH OF THE SERVICES COMING TOGETHER AND STOPPING THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS FOR EACH CHILD A YOUNG PERSON THAT COMES IN THE CARE THERE IS AN INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED CARE PLAN WHERE IT IS NOT ABOUT FINDING A BED OR PUT IN A ROOF OVER THE YOUNG PERSON'S HEAD IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THEIR CARE NEEDS
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INSURANCE COMPANY AXA IS DISPOSING OF ALL OF ITS TOBACCO RELATED INVESTMENTS CANCER CHARITIES HAVE WELCOMED THE DECISION WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED AT A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONFERENCE IN GENEVA FROM THEIR IMAGE IN FOLKS
DESPITE EVER STRICTER REGULATIONS ON PACKAGING AND ADVERTISING PEOPLE STILL SMOKE AND TOBACCO REMAINS A GOOD FINANCIAL BET BUT NOW AXA SAYS IT WILL END ITS INVESTMENT GETTING RID OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS OF TOBACCO BELATED EQUITY AND BONDS
AXA EXECUTIVES SAY THERE WILL BE A COST TO THE COMPANY IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ARGUE THAT IN THE LONG TERM INVESTING IN A PRODUCT WHICH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ESTIMATES WILL CLAIM ONE BILLION LIVES IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE

CONTROL SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN
IF IT FALLS AS EASILY AS THE IRAQI AUTHORITIES HOPE THEY WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO MOVE ON AND TACKLE THE MUCH BIGGER CHALLENGE IRAQ'S SECOND CITY OF MOSUL IN THE NORTH WHICH WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE MILITANTS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO
BUT IF THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE HER STAND UP FOR LUCIA IT COULD BE A LONG AND TOUGH BATTLE ON HER VISITS TO VIETNAM AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS LIFTED A LONGSTANDING BAN ON SELLING WEAPONS TO THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT MY OBAMA SAID THE DECISION REMOVED A LINGERING VESTIGE OF THE COLD WAR FUTURE ARMS SALES WOULD STILL NEED TO MEET THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S STRICT GUY IT'S A STRICT RULES

THERE ARE FEWER AREAS OF HEALTH POLICY HAS FRAUGHT AND POLARISED AS DIETARY ADVICE U.K. GUIDELINES UPDATED IN MARCH SET OUT RECOMMENDED PROPORTIONS OF DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES SOME ELEMENTS SUCH AS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO EAT FRESH VEGETABLES AREN'T CONTROVERSIAL BUT THE NATIONAL OBESITY FORM HAS ATTACKED ADVICE TO CUT SATURATED FATS TO CHOOSE VEGETABLE OILS AND TO BASE MALES AROUND STARCHY FOODS SUCH AS PASTA POTATOES OR RICE
IT'S ALSO CRITICISED CALORIE COUNTING TO LOSE WEIGHT PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND HAS ACCUSED THE CHARITY OF PUTTING THE NATION'S HEALTH AT RISK RESPONDING TO THE SUGGESTION AT THE GUIDELINES REFLECT COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND SAYS THEY WERE DRAWN UP BY INDEPENDENT EXPERTS WHO REVIEWED ALL THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AND WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ENSURE NO BIAS

THE CLEARER SIGNAL BUT THIS IS A WARNING ABOUT UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION IF WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE TURKEY OF COURSE HE'S NOT IN THE E.U. ITS LEADERS HAVE LONG DREAMT THAT IT WILL BE ONE DAY AND THEY'VE HAD THE BACKING NOT JUST OF ALL THREE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES IN THIS COUNTRY BUT HAVE A CERTAIN BORIS JOHNSON AS WELL
THE CAMPAIGN HE'S A LEADER OF THOUGH NOW BELIEVES THAT THE MERE PROSPECT COULD BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU TO CONVERT THE BRITISH PEOPLE AS A WHOLE THAT IT'S TIME FOR US TO QUIT WILL HEAR WHY FROM IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IN JUST A MOMENT HIS VIEWS ALSO ON THE TREASURY NEW WARNING OF A RECESSION IN THE EVENT OF A BRICKS IT FIRST LET'S HEAR SOME VOICES FROM GREEN LANES IN NORTH LONDON WHERE MANY TURKISH BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS ARE BASED
I BELIEVE THIS POSTERS I'M NOT RACIST AT DINNER DAY ATTACKS PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WE ALREADY PAID A LOT OF TAX WITH LLOYD A NOT BUSINESS RATES WE TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT WHAT WE S'POSED TO GIVE ANYWAYS
I JUST PERSONALLY THINK IT'S NOT THAT REALISTIC IN TERMS OF THE POSTER ITSELF THE FACT THAT TURKEY HAS BEEN TRYING TO ENTER THE E.U. IN MANY YEARS AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THAT IS TYPICAL FRIENDSHIP TO SEE
EVERYONE THINKS THAT TOOK IT WANT TO COME DID YOU HE'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE THE ENEMY
LET'S TALK FIRST TO CHRIS MORRIS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT IN BRUSSELS IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE IS IT NOT CHRIS MORRIS THE TURKEY IS ON THE ROUTE TO JOINING THE E.U. EVEN IF IT IS NOT ACTUALLY JOINING THE E.U.
IT'S CERTAINLY ON THE PATH MICK BUT THE PHRASE TURKEY IS JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IS SIMPLY WRONG AND THE POSTERS EVEN GOT THE NUMBERS WRONG THE POPULATION ISN'T SEVENTY SIX MILLION IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY NINE NOW SO THERE IS SOME FACT CHECKING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE I LIVED IN TURKEY BACK IN THE NINETIES AND I'VE BEEN COVERING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME TWENTY NINE YEARS SINCE HE'D APPLIED FOR MEMBERSHIP ELEVEN YEARS SINCE LIMITED NEGOTIATIONS ACTUALLY BEGAN THE MOST TALKS HAVE STUMBLED AT EVERY TURN
MOST OF THE SENSITIVE ISSUES HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ADDRESSED AND AT THE MOMENT TURKEYS REFUSAL TO RECOGNISE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS AN E.U. MEMBER STATE MEANS THE WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN FROZEN FOR YEARS AND YET CHRIS GOVERNMENT AFTER GOVERNMENT SAYS WE WANT TURKEY TO JOIN IF IT'S SO CLEAR WHY DON'T GOVERNMENTS IN GENERAL SO SORRY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET
THIS IS THE CONUNDRUM NICK BACKING TURKEY'S MEMBERSHIP BID HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF BRITISH POLICY IN EUROPE FOR YEARS TONY BLAIR WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER SO TOO HAS DAVID CAMERON BEEN SO HIS TONE HAS CHANGED UNDER THE PRESSURES PRODUCED BY THE REFERENDUM WHY WAS THE SUPPORT THEIR WEALTH FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS PARTLY ABOUT MAKING THE E. U.
WIDER NOT DEEPER THE IDEA BEING THAT IF MORE COUNTRIES JOINED THE UNION WILL BECOME LOOSE AND IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE U.K. IF OTHER LARGE COUNTRIES WERE INVOLVED WITHOUT BEING PART OF THE CORE AROUND THE EUROZONE BUT THERE'S ALSO A BROADER STRATEGIC POINT THERE'S A LOT OF COUNTRIES BUY INTO TRYING TO KEEP TURKEY ON SIDE AS PART OF THE WESTERN WORLD AND THEREFORE ENCOURAGING THEIR MEMBERSHIP BID
WITHOUT FRANKLY EVER HOPING THAT IT WILL MAKE MUCH PROGRESS AND IN THAT SENSE I THINK TURKEY'S PRESIDENT TYPE EVERYONE HAS A POINT WHEN HE SAYS COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE BEHAVED HYPOCRITICALLY TOWARDS TURKEY FOR YEARS THEY HAVE NICK CAN WE SING THAT AGAIN CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AS A SAY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE FORMER WORK AND HUNCH AND SECRETARY IS HERE YOU CAN HEAR HIM IN THE STUDIO WITH ME NOW
WHICH IS CLEAR UP A SIMPLE FACT FOR MOST OF ALL IT IS THE CASE THAT BRITAIN AND INDEED ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE E.U. DO YOU HAVE A VETO THEY COULD AT ANY STAGE BLOCK TURKISH MEMBERSHIP THEIR INDIVIDUAL NATION DOES ACCORDING TO THE RULES HAVE A VETO HOWEVER
WHAT IS IMPORTANT WE'VE BEEN MADE YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE THEMSELVES DON'T BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COME BACK AND OFFER A REFERENDUM TO RENEGE ON THAT TOMMY'S RETRENCHED ANY MORE THAN SAID YESTERDAY HE WAS HE WAS HE GOVERNMENT DOES HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVING A REFERENDUM I IT WAS THROUGH A VETO THROUGH BRITISH PEOPLE VOTING NOT TO HAVE THIS AND THE RULES ARE QUITE CLEAR I UNDERSTAND THE FOREIGN OFFICE'S ADMITTED THIS
THAT UNLESS THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE TO E.U. LAW ON ACCESSION AS WERE FOR CROATIA ET-CETERA THEN THERE IS NO NEED AND WILL NOT BE A TRIGGERED REFERENDUM SO IS IT ALL SACKED AS BRITISH PEOPLE CAN'T VOTE AND THAT'S THE KEY BIT ABOUT IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT DESPITE DAVID CAMERON'S LONG HELD SUPPORT FOR TURKISH MEMBERSHIP AND OTHERS
LOOK ROUND EUROPE FRANCE HISTORICALLY ALWAYS OPPOSED TURKISH MEMBERSHIP GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR MERKEL ALWAYS OPPOSED TURKISH MEMBERSHIP
O.K. LET'S DEAL WITH THIS THIS IS A GOVERNMENT POLICY TO HAVE TURKEY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS ALSO EUROPEAN UNION POLICY TO HAVE TURKEY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WHOLE SECOND THE REALITY IS THOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE VARIOUS SUCCESSIONS ON EVERY SINGLE GROUP OF EXCEPTIONS WHETHER IT BE POLAND AND THE BALTIC STATES THEN ROMANIA ET-CETERA
THERE IS ALWAYS A ROW AMONGST INDIVIDUAL NATIONS ABOUT SOME WHO DON'T SOME WHO DO WANT THEM IN BUT EVERY ONE OF THOSE ACCESSION GROUPS I REMEMBER BEING IN THIS DEBATE LONG ENOUGH WE WERE TOLD ENDLESSLY THERE WERE HUGE ROAD BLOCKS TO THESE GROUPS COMING IN BUT EVERY TIME THOSE RESULT OF THOSE ROAD BLOCKS HAVE RESOLVED AND IN THEY COME AND MOST RECENTLY WITH THE ROMANIANS WE WERE TOLD THAT WOULD NOT COME FOR SOME TIME ACTUALLY THEY CAME EARLIER AND QUICKER THEN WAS ACCEPTED CAN I MAKE ONE THRILLING THEN WE'VE GOT THIS PROJECT I THINK OF YOU CHARLES
IS THERE A DANGER THAT YOUR ATTITUDE TO MANY WHO AGREE WITH YOU ARE FORMED BY
WHAT YOU SEE THE BAD THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF EUROPE THE RISE OF MARINE LE PEN THE RISE TODAY POSSIBLY ON THE FAR RIGHT MANNERS PRISONS OF AUSTRIA IT IS INCONCEIVABLE IN THE POLITICS OF TODAY THE TURKEY WILL JOIN IN THE NEXT DECADE POSSIBLY TWO POSSIBLY LONGER I JUST NEVER ACCEPTED THAT THERE ARE FORECAST ABOUT THESE THINGS HAPPENING BECAUSE HER DOWN TO POLITICAL DESIRE TO CHANGE THAT'S THE THING I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION ONCE IT MAKES ITS MIND UP
BUREAUCRATIC LEE THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THEN THEY MAKE THESE THINGS HAPPEN FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SEEN BY MOST PEOPLE A TURKEY HAS NOW BEEN INCLUDED IN THE STANDARDS AUTHORITY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SEE THEY'RE NOW A MEMBER OF THAT SO MAKING DECISIONS ALONGSIDE MACEDONIAN BY THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT TURKEY BUT ALBANIA MACEDONIA MONTENEGRO AND SERBIA ALL IN LINE TO COME INTO THE INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION SO FIRST OF ALL TURKEYS IN THE STANDARDS AUTHORITY ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SECONDLY
I'VE BEEN MADE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE FOR TRANSLATION SO WHAT I WAS THINKING NONE OF THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH FORGIVE ME YOUR POSTER WHICH IS THE IMPLICATION THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE NEVER FINISH A BOY THIS IS QUITE IMPORTANT THE POINT I'M MAKING ABOUT THE YEW YEW IS ONCE YOU START THE WRETCHED THEN IT BEGINS AND IT'S JUST STARTED AND REMEMBER TURKEY IS IN A WHOLLY DIFFERENT POSITION FROM YOUR COMMENTATORS VIEW REMEMBER THEY HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION OUT OVER A BARREL
BECAUSE ALL OF THE MIGRANTS THAT WAS POURING ACROSS THE BORDERS INTO GREECE IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS THEY'RE HOLDING THAT AND CHECK THEY'RE TAKING MONEY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IT ANY DAY IF THEY FEEL THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION ABSOLUTELY IS NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM ALL THEY HAVE TO SAY IS ON YOUR WAY YOU CAN CARRY ON GOING O.K. MY POINT DO YOU NEGOTIATE THE ANGEL YEP THEY WILL MAKE IT TO PUT PRESSURE ON GERMANY AND ON FRANCES MORRIS IS A YORK CORRESPONDENT USED TO BE A TURKEY HE KNOWS A THING OR TWO HE SAYS IT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE TO SAY
THAT TURKEY IS JOINING THE E.U. IT'S NOT I SUGGEST YOU SHOULD REWRITE YOUR POSTER AND I THINK WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A POSTER THAT SAYS TURKEY MIGHT ONE DAY JOIN ME IF BRITAIN AND TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES CHOOSE NOT TO VETO IT WILL I THINK THERE'S A CENTRAL CORE BELIEF I SAT IN GOVERNMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE I RESIGNED AND AT EVERY TURN IT WAS MADE CLEAR NOT ONLY IS IT GOVERNMENT POLICY FOR THEM TO JOIN IT IS
TIVOLI GOVERNMENT DESIRE THAT THEY WILL PUSH AND GET THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES BUT THIS IS YOUR GUESS AND THE DRY MINUTES NON THOUGH THEY'RE VERY CLEAR WITH THIS THAT IS IT WELL THEY WERE VAL'S A FACT FACT IS JOINING THE THE FACT IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS SAID THEY WANT TURKEY INTO THE E.U. SO WE CAN DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT'S A FACT IT WAS A FACT THAT THE EAST EUROPEANS WOULD COME IN THAT WAS IT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE ECONOMY BECAUSE COS I'M SURE YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THEIR TREASURIES WARNING OF A RECESSION IF THERE'S BRECK'S IT OR YOU DO FORGIVE ME I'LL GET HER FOR YOU
HOW MUCH OF AN ECONOMIC SHOCK WOULD THERE BE IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U.
IT'S A REALITY THAT CHANGE ALWAYS BEINGS ISSUES AROUND IT AND ALWAYS USE ME WITH A SHOCK WHAT NOW I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'LL BE A SHOCKER ACTUALLY DON'T AND I HAVE NOT SEEN SOME OF THE INDEPENDENT REPORTS THAT SAY THERE'S NOT I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT THIS WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT
ON THIS PROGRAMME TODAY SARAH GOT AN INCREDIBLE EXCEPT ADMISSION FROM SUCH A JAVID YOU I'M DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN BY THE WAY OF HAVING PRIVATELY SAID HOW MUCH YOU WANTED THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NOW ON DEFENDING THIS TERRIBLE REPORT AND WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT HE SAID TO YOU HE HAS YOU'RE HERE ABSOLUTELY THAT HE WANTED OUT HE HAS HE'S EYEING HIM UP WELL HE'S WRITTEN IT IN AN ARTICLE AND HE SAID HE WASN'T SURE BUT I DON'T THAT'S NOT THE MISSION THE MISSION I'M REALLY AFTER IS
THAT HE SAID WERE IMPRESSED THAT THE REPORT ITSELF WHY HAS NOT THE UPSIDE OF THE FORTNIGHT EVERY TREASURY REPORT HAS A CENTRAL PRESUMPTION FROM WHICH THERE ARE DOWN SIDES
AND THEN THERE ARE UPSIDES AND THEY HAVE TODAY CHOSEN ONLY TO REDUCE THE DOWNSIDE WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHY HAVE YOU NOT PRODUCE THE UPSIDE HE SAID THAT'S NOT OUR JOB TO PRODUCE THE UPSIDE REPORT THAT'S FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE NOW HANG ON A SECOND THAT MAKES THIS REPORT CATEGORICALLY
UNFAIR AND BIASED AS A TREASURY REPORT LETTER BETTER SAME MISSION OH KAY IN THE MISSION YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE UPSIDE OF LEAVING LET'S GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT YOU SAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING SPELL OUT THE DOWNSIDE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL LARGE ECONOMIC SHOCK IF WE TEAR UP A CENTRAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WELL I DON'T THINK THAT THAT DOWNSIDE EXIST FOR THE U.K. IT MIGHT
WELL JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN INVENT A MITE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THAT AIRY RIVALS FOR EXAMPLE WHO ADVISES BORIS JOHNSON ON THE ECONOMY ACTUALLY SAID THERE WOULD BE A DOWNTURN IT SHOULD GET BETTER LATER BUT HE SAID THE BEAR SIGNIFICANT SHOCK BUT ACTUALLY GERHARD LIONS ALSO PRODUCED A REPORT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN WHICH SHE FORECAST THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD LEAD TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE JOBS BEING CREATED FAR MORE THAN STAYING IN NOW HERE'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS
THE TREASURY REMEMBER THE CHANCELLOR SAID YOU CAN'T TRUST TREASURY REPORTS WHICH IS WHY WE GO TO THE O.B. ARE FOR INDEPENDENT REPORT WE MUST TAKE THIS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE TREASURY COS EVERYONE IS FIDDLE WITH BY CHANCELLORS AND THE POINT ABOUT THIS ONE TODAY JUST REMEMBER THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS OF THIS REPORT MAY NEVER DO RELEASE THEM BY THE WAY BEFORE YOU GET AN INTERVIEW
BUT IT'S WORTH REMINDING US THE SAME TREASURY ACTUALLY AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE IN THE R.E.M. WHEN WE WERE UNDER PRESSURE TO LEAVE THE R.E.M. THEY SAID IF WE LEFT IT WOULD BE A DISASTER SHORT TERM INFLATION WOULD RISE RATES WOULD INCREASE THE ECONOMY WOULD SHRINK
WHEN WE LEFT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED WELL INFLATION CAME DOWN AND ACTUALLY WE CREATED MORE JOBS AND MY POINT IS YOU THEY CANNOT FORECAST SHORT TERM SUCCESSFULLY THEY HAVE NEVER MANAGED TO DO IT WELL AS YOU KNOW IS NOT JUST THE TREASURE IT IS LITERALLY EVERY SIGNIFICANT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FORECASTER WHO SAYS THERE WILL BE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK I WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE LAST CHANCE TO COMMENT ON SOMETHING MORE BROADLY THOUGH IS THERE NOT A DANGER
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS LIKE YOU TELL THE PUBLIC YOU CANNOT BELIEVE A WORD RESPECTED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS PEOPLE LIKE THE GOVERNOR BANK OF ENGLAND PEOPLE LIKE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE N.H.S. IF YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM IS THESE PEOPLE ARE EITHER FOOLS OR LIARS OR YOU'RE NOT PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF EXTREMISTS NOT REALLY ACTUALLY I THINK IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING WRONG WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHAT YOU SEE GOING ON IN PLACES LIKE FRANCE AND GREECE I MEAN I'VE MET SOMEBODY OTHER THEY WERE WHERE YOU CAME BACK FROM GREECE THEY SAID THEY'RE LIVING IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS BECAUSE THE E.U. IS HAMMERING THEM SO ALL THESE PEOPLE AT ALL HE'S NOT THERE I'M TELLING YOU NOW THAT EVERY SINGLE TRACK RECORD I MEAN EVERYONE OF THESE SAME BODIES THE I.M.F. THE O.E.C.D. THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE TREASURY ALL FORECAST NO CRASH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WENT THE BIGGEST RECESSION SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR ONE POINT I MAKE IS
ALL FORECAST OR EVENTUALLY WRONG AND THAT IS WHAT THE O.B. ARE SAID AND I BELIEVE THEM INTO CAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT
THE PRESIDENT OF HUNGARY'S IN THE U.K. THIS WEEK AND HE BRINGS WITH HIM A RATHER UNUSUAL GIFT SAINT THOMAS BECKET'S ELBOW THE RELIC WAS TAKEN TO HUNGRY AFTER THE THEN ARCHBISHOP WAS MURDERED IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHAT REMAINED OF HIS BODY HERE WAS DESTROYED AND HENRY THE EIGHTH TIME WHEN VENERATION OF SAINTS WERE SEEN AS IDOLATROUS
THE ELBOW WILL BE TAKEN ON A PILGRIMAGE OF LONDON AND CANTERBURY BEFORE BEING RETURNED TO HUNGARY AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR PATER SABOT HOW PEGGY AND BY THE HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ENGLAND AND WALES CARNAL VINCENT NICHOLS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING MORNING CAN I STOP WITH YOU CANNOT BECAUSE WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT NOT ONLY ABOUT THIS BONE BUT THAT IT'S MAKING ITS WAY ROUND THE U.K. THIS WEEK
WELL IT'S A RETURN JOURNEY EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS LATE BUT THIS RELICS COMES IN TO THE LIFE OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND
DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IT HELPS TO SOLIDIFY THAT GROWING SHARING OF LIFE THAT TAKES PLACE NOW BETWEEN CHRISTIAN CHURCHES AND IN MANY WAYS THIS WAS SYMBOLISED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WHEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY POPE SENT JOHN PAUL THE SECOND PRAYED AT THE TOMB OF BACK AT SIDE BY SIDE IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL
AND SECONDLY I THINK IT REMINDS ALL CHRISTIANS BUT THERE COMES A POINT IT WHICH THEIR LOYALTY TO CHRIST BECOMES THE OVERRIDING LOYALTY OF THEIR LIVES AND THEY MY TOUGH O.K. A FINAL PRICED SO A TINY BIT OF BONE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FROM THOMAS BECKET IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT IN UNITING THE CHURCHES
IT'S AS A RELIC AT IT'S A POINTER TOUR AND A CONTACT WITH A GREAT PERSON BUT YOU KNOW WE SHOULDN'T FORGET THAT IT'S THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SAW THE MOST CHRISTIAN MARTYRS IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY AND IT IS A REMINDER THAT MARTYRDOM IS OFTEN PART OF FOLLOWING CHRIST O.K. NOW PEWTER SABA GETTY HOW DID IT END UP IN A
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THAT THEY'RE SET OF EVENTS THAT THAT BROUGHT TO THE RELIC THERE BUT I MEAN THERE ARE
A NUMBER OF OTHER WAYS DEBT THAT WE CAN WE CAN BE SURE OF THAT BUT IT IS THE RELIC THAT THE BONE OF THOMAS A BECKET FIRST OF ALL
TWENTY YEARS FOLLOWING THE MARTYRDOM THERE WAS ALREADY A VERY STRONG COAL TAE FOLLOWING OF SAINT THOMAS A BECKET AND THE ARCHBISHOP OF ESTELLA GUM LOOK AT FOUNDED A CHURCH
NAMED AFTER THOMAS A BECKET ON ON THE HILL IN ESTHER GUM WHICH WAS ALSO NAMED AFTER SAINT THOMAS A BECKET SO IT WAS A READY AND OPERATING CHURCH TWENTY YEARS FOLLOWING THE MARTYRDOM
BUT ALSO MIGRATE OF THREATS WHO LATER MARY KING THE THIRD
OF HUNGARY SHE SHE KNEW BECKETT VERY VERY WELL AND HER AND SHE GREW UP IN IN THE COURT OF OF HER FATHER IN LAW HENRY THE SECOND PEN SHE SHE BROUGHT THAT CULT THERE SO NOW ALL OF THIS LED THEN TO
EITHER LOOK AT ASKING FOR THE RELIC TO BE BROUGHT OR PROBABLY WHAT HE'S MOST LIKELY WHAT HAPPENED IT'S FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE MARKET AND THERE WAS A REBURIAL IN CANTERBURY N. AND THEN DID THE RELICS OR HAD THEIR BONES OF THOMAS A BECKET WERE BROUGHT FROM HERE IS
HIS TOMB DOWN UP TO A SHRINE IN THE CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL AND WHEN WE CONSIDER WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THAT ELBOW DESPITE HUNGARY'S HISTORY UNDER COMMUNISM NOT LEAST SURVIVED BETTER THAN THE REST OF THE REMAINS HERE AT HERE IN ENGLAND THERE ARE SOME REMAINS WHOM AN ENGLAND THAT SO THERE'S A PART OF HIS SKULL WHICH WOULD BE BROUGHT DOWN FROM STONY HURSTON WILL BE REUNITED WITH THE ALBERT REFUTES NOT TO THE BIZARRE
AND BUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THE REFORMATION OF COURSE WAS THAT BECKETT PRECISELY STOOD FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CHURCH FROM THE PREVAILING POWER AT THE TIME AND OF COURSE AT THE REFORMATION THAT WAS CONCEIVED IT SO THE THE REFORMATION CHURCH IN THIS COUNTRY WORKED VERY HARD TO OBLITERATE
EVERY REP EVERY REFERENCE TO BACK AT BECAUSE HE AS IT WERE A REMINDER THAT THE WHOLE OF CHRISTIANITY OF THE NEED TO STAND AGAINST A PREVAILING CIVIL POWER WHICH OF THE FOUR HUNGRY OF COURSE WAS COMMUNISM
YES IN FACT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE ARCHBISHOP OF ESTELLA GUN CORD NOT LEAK I INITIATED AN ANNUAL CANDLE LIGHTING CEREMONY WHICH ARE ALSO INCLUDED THEN A SYMPOSIUM WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATED SENSE ON THE FEAST DAY OF SAINT THOMAS A BECKET ON DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH AND ANNETTE SYMPOSIUM THEN IS ORGANISED FOR LEADERS OF DIFFERENT CHURCHES AND CIVIL SOCIETY AND OF COURSE TEA
HE WAS A SYMBOL OF RESISTANCE HE WAS A SYMBOL OF RESISTANCE YES AND HAS IT I MEAN AND SO THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK WE HAVE A PROCESSION OF THESE BONES WELL NO THEY'RE GOING FROM QUITE A TRIP YES THEY'VE GONE SO WHAT DO I MEAN FORGIVE ME FOR HAVE THAT BUT DO WE KNOW IT'S HIS ELBOW REALLY WELL ANYBODY'S DONE ANY SORT OF
DO YOU NEED I THINK SO I THINK WE RELY MORE ON THE NARRATIVE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THESE HISTORIC CONNECTIONS FROM THE SAME BUS ADDRESS EXPLAINED THEM SO IF THEY'RE NOT WITH THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF IT'S BANG ON ALL THE PROBABILITY IS THAT HE DID SO AND AND IT IS A WONDERFUL PROCESSION FROM WESTMINSTER CATHEDRAL TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY TO THE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT TO THE CITY AND THEN EVENTUALLY TO THE PLACE OF HIS MARTYRDOM IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL
CARDINAL VINCENT NICHOLS AND PETER SABOT EGGY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT GARY RICHARDS AND I'LL GET IT RIGHT GARY RICHARDS IS HERE WITH THE SPORTS MONICA MORNING ENGLAND TO TURKEY ONCE A VICTORY IN THE FIRST OF THREE FRIENDLY MATCHES FOR ENGLAND BEFORE THE START OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS VADIM KANE SCORED THE GOALS CAME ALSO MY PENALTY HIS MANAGER ROY HODGSON'S REPORT BUT WE PLAY WELL ESPECIALLY GOING FORWARD I THOUGHT WAS A GOOD ATTACKING MOVEMENT WE'VE CHOSEN A QUALITY OPPONENT ANOTHER
CAME WITH EIGHTY IF YOU LIKE THEY HAVE SOME GOOD PLAYERS AND WERE CAPABLE OF CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS
THAT'S GOOD FOR ME BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL AREAS WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT WE ARE STILL NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WHERE WE'D LIKE TO BE BUT THAT'S NOT SO SURPRISING WHEN YOU THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN
ONLY TOGETHER FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND IT'S A WHILE SINCE WE PLAYED OUR LAST INSULATION MATCHES OUR FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY JOINS US HELLO JOHN MORNING ROY HODGSON SAYS THEY HAVE AREAS TO WORK ON AND THAT WOULD BE THE DEFENCE IT LOOK VERY VULNERABLE AGAIN DIDN'T IT YEAH CERTAINLY A POSITIVE THAT THAT CANE AND VARTY BOTH SCORED AND SOUL CONTINUED THE THE FORM
BUT THEY'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WITHIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ALTHOUGH BODIES OFF TO GET MARRIED ON WEDNESDAY SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN FRIDAY'S MATCH AGAINST AUSTRALIA I FELT A BIG PLUS AS WELL WAS THE WAY THAT THE TOTTENHAM PLAYERS SHOWED AFTER THE DISAPPOINTMENTS THAT THEY HAD AND THE SLUMP TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEASON BUT YES ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE THE CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT THE DEFENCE THAT DOES LOOK TO BE THE GREATEST AREA OF WEAKNESS
BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY TIME TURKEY CAME FORWARD THEY CAUSED SCARES FOR ENGLAND AT THE BACK AND CONCERN ABOUT JACK WILSHIRE TAKEN OFF DURING THE SECOND HALF WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE HIM IN TERMS OF TRAVELLING TO FRANCE IN THE SQUAD WELL AT THE END OF THIS WEEK ROY HODGSON'S GOING TO CUT HIS SQUAD DOWN FROM TWENTY SIX TO THE TWENTY THREE AND IT'S LIKELY THAT ONLY TWO OF THE MIDFIELD FOR OF WILSHIRE HENDERSON DRINKWATER AND DELPH WILL BE SELECTED AND WILSHIRE HENDERSON ARE BOTH COMING BACK FROM INJURIES AT THE LATTER CAME ON FOR THE FORMER YESTERDAY
I THOUGHT WILL SHE LOOKED SHORT OF FITNESS IN ALL HONESTY I'D SAY ON THE BASIS OF THAT THAT THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG AWAY FROM HIM A LITTLE BUT FRIDAY IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT GAME FOR JACK WILSHIRE YOU'RE IN MANCHESTER WHERE UNITED WILL SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE NAME MARINO AS THEIR NEW MANAGER LOTS OF COVERAGE IN THE PAPERS IT PROMISES TO BE A FASCINATING POINT ABOUT IMPOSSIBLY SHORT AS OFTEN THE CASE WITH HIM YOU SURE SIMMERING ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES THIS MORNING I NOTICED SO MANCHESTER IS GOING TO BE THE PLACE TO BE NEXT SEASON BUT I THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS QUITE APART FROM
WHO MANCHESTER UNITED SIGN WHERE THE MARINE YOU'RE WILL GIVE YOUTH A CHANCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT LOUIS VAN GAALE HAS I DON'T DOUBT MARINE YOU'RE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS WILL SHOWS HIM RENE YOUR STYLE OF FOOTBALL BE ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH FOR THE SUPPORTERS OF MANCHESTER UNITED
KNOW IT WAS FAILING TO QUALIFY FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THAT I THINK REALLY DID FOR VAN GOGH BUT MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS TURNED AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OF THE COLOURLESS PERFORMANCES AT OLD TRAFFORD AND ATTACKING FOOTBALL HASN'T HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN SHOWS EH MARINE YOURS PRIORITY WHAT IS HIS PRIORITY IS WINNING FOOTBALL
AND ONE FINAL QUICK THOUGHT YOU MENTION FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES THERE'S SEVEN PAGES IN THE SIDE IN THE TIMES IF I WAS FASCINATED BY AND GO ACTUALLY FIND OUT ABOUT MARINOS ARRIVAL WHEN HE WAS TOLD BY HIS WIFE AT THE END OF THE CUP FINAL SHE'D READ IT ON THE B.B.C. SPORT WEBSITE YEAH I THINK IT IS A SIDE ISSUE BUT I THINK THE PIA FROM MANCHESTER UNITED SIDE HAS LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED IT DID NOT CONTROLLED THIS AT ALL
ALL OF THE RUNNING SEEMS TO HAVE COME FROM THE MARINE YOUR END AND WILL VAN GARGLE WILLIE STAGE BEEN DRAGGING ON FOR MONTHS AND IT ALL RESULTED IN A RATHER JOYLESS POST MATCH PRESS CONFERENCE AT WEMBLEY AFTER VANGUARD ANGOLA JUST WHEN THE F.A. CUP SHOULD HAVE BEEN A JOYFUL OCCASION FOR HIM BUT

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DONE IT IS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE NOW CRITICAL TO WHETHER TURKEY DOES JOIN THE E.U. OR NOT WILL BE ITS ATTITUDE TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY THIS WEEKEND PRESIDENT TO THE GIANT STEP TOWARDS CONCENTRATE EVEN MORE POWER IN HIS OWN HANDS IN POINTED HIS OWN MAN AS PRIME MINISTER HAVING FIRST REPLACED THE MAN HE FORCED TO RESIGN BOTH ARE COMMITTED TO A HARDLINE STANDS AGAINST THE ARMED KURDISH SEPARATIST THE P.K.K.
TURKEY AND ME YOU AND THE U.N. CLASSIFY AS A TERRORIST ORGANISATION BUT THE UNITED NATIONS NOW WANTS TO SEND INVESTIGATORS TO LOOK INTO A DISTURBING INTO SOME DISTURBING EVIDENCE EMERGING FROM THE KURDISH TOWN OF CHEERS RAY LOCAL PEOPLE AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SAY THE TURKISH FORCES MASSACRED AROUND ONE HUNDRED CIVILIANS THERE A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN NOW REPORTS FROM SOUTH EAST
THUNDER LIGHTNING RAIN
THE WEATHER'S MATCHING THE POLITICAL OUTLOOK HERE IN SOUTH EASTERN TURKEY THE LONGSTANDING WAR BETWEEN THE TURKISH STATE AND THE KURDISH P.K.K. IS ON AGAIN
HE IS DEEPLY DIVIDED
I'M IN A BIG FIELD WITH A LOT OF DISPLACED FAMILIES BUT FORTY FAMILIES
FROM A TOWER ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY I CAN SEE IT ON THE HILL IT'S BULLSHIT
THE TOWN IS UNDER CURFEW AND THERE'S BEEN FIGHTING THERE BETWEEN TOOK HIS FORCES THE P.K.K.
SMALL ARMS FIRE MORTAR IMPACTS AS WELL THAT I'VE SEEN AND IT'S PRETTY CONTENT
THIS IS SMOKE RISING NEAR A MINARET AND TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN AS WELL THERE ARE SOME BIG EXCHANGE
ONE EXTENDED FAMILY INVITED ME OUT OF THE RAIN INTO THEIR TENT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED HER SON IS FIGHTING WITH THE P.K.K.
HIS FATHER WHO CAN LOOK DOWN ON THE BATTLE FROM THE TENT SAID HIS HEART MELTS LIKE SNOW'S HE WORRIES WHETHER HIS BOYS STILL ALIVE ONE OF THE MOTHERS SAW HER CHILDHOOD BEING REPLAYED
SO IT'S THE ONLY VICIOUSLY I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN THEY DID THE SAME THING TO US THEY DESTROYED OUR HOUSES THEY FORCED US TO LEAVE
OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME THING THAT'S WHY I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE BACK THEN THEY KILLED MY AUNT SHE WAS EXPECTING ANOTHER KIDS THEY MADE OUR LIVES MISERABLE NOW THEY'RE DOING THE SAME TIRED CHILDREN JUST BECAUSE WERE KURDS THEY DON'T THINK WE'RE HUMANS AND IF YOU THINK IT'S ON THE PLUS SIGN
OR COME TO THE TOWN OF CHEERS RAY ONE OF THE BIGGER TOWNS AROUND HERE IN SOUTH EAST TURKEY FOUR WEEKS EARLIER IN THE YEAR IT WAS UNDER A FULL MILITARY CURFEW PEOPLE COULDN'T LEAVE THEIR HOUSES AND WHILE THAT WAS GOING ON
THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF VIOLENCE HERE STREETS WERE BADLY DAMAGED AND HAVE BEEN BULLDOZED THE WHOLE PLACE IN SOME AREAS IS COMPLETELY FLAT
SO THIS IS THE ALLEGATION WHEN IT'S VERY SERIOUS LOCAL PEOPLE INCHES RAY SAY THAT TURKISH FORCES KILLED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED CIVILIANS WHEN THEY WERE SHELTERING IN A SERIES OF BASEMENTS
THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED ANY MASS KILLING OF CIVILIANS THEY SAY THEY'RE USING LEGITIMATE FORCE AGAINST ARMED TERRORISTS AND REFUSED A REPEATED REQUESTS FOR AN INTERVIEW
THE UN WANTS TO SEND IN HUMAN RIGHTS INVESTIGATORS THAT'S ALL TOO LATE FOR MAC MOOD DO WHO WAS KILLED IN ONE OF THE BASEMENTS HIS WIDOW LOOK FEET CLUTCHES HER THREE YEAR OLD SON THE YOUNGEST OF FIVE CHILDREN
NURSES BITTER HATRED FOR TURKEYS PRESIDENT TO ONE OTHER

WHAT DID HE DO HOW WILL I DON'T LIVE WITH THE SIN OF WHAT HE DID TO MY KIDS THEY'RE A TARZAN'S OFF PEOPLE LIKE ME
NO IF THE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE A TRUE QUESTIONS ARE BOUND TO BE ASKED ABOUT EUROPE'S DEALINGS WITH PRESIDENT DE JUAN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE IS
A FIT AND PROPER PERSON TO TRY TO MAKE AN AGREEMENT WITH ABOUT THE FUTURE OF REFUGEES IN THE SAFEGUARDING OF CIVILIANS
WHEN ARMED FORCES UNDER HIS ORDERS HAVE GONE INTO CHEERS RAY AND OTHER KURDISH TOWNS AND BEHAVED IN A MANNER WHICH THE UN AT LEAST FIELD NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED
IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA CROWDS WERE CELEBRATING A NATIONAL HOLIDAY WATCHING THE CHANGING OF THE GUARD AT THE HUGE MAUSOLEUM OF COMO HAS ATTACKED THE MAN WHO FOUNDED THE MODERN TURKISH
THERE WEREN'T MANY HEADSCARVES OR BEARDS ATATURK WANTED TURKEY TO BE SECULAR
PRESIDENT AND HIS A.K. PARTY A ISLAMISTS THEY'RE REMAKING TURKEY AND DIVIDING
BUT MOST TURKS AGREE THAT THE P.K.K. ARE TERRORISTS OF THE WORST KIND AND THE TURKISH SECURITY FORCES ARE HERE
SO PUT THE HEART BUT THE MICE FOR US
TURKEY SWIRLED USUALLY ATTACK CATO HEATH
THE PEOPLE THEY ARE SACRIFICING DEAL LIVES ON

TURKEY IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE WAR IN SYRIA AND IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS THAT'S COME FROM IT AND AS WELL AS THAT TURKEY IS AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF NATO
IF TURKEY IS UNSTABLE IT IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR EUROPE AND FOR THE MIDDLE EAST
JEREMY BOWEN REPORTING THERE IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK THEY'LL BE LINING UP IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TODAY WHY BECAUSE THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF HEARINGS INTO THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. STARTS TODAY AND M.P.S ARE NO DOUBT READY TO THROW THINGS

THE FORMER RACING DRIVER TWICE BANKRUPT YACHT ENTHUSIAST WITH NO RETAIL EXPERIENCE IS IT THE FLAMBOYANT RETAIL TYCOON BILLIONAIRE OR HIS GLAMOROUS WIFE AND WHAT ABOUT THE BIT PLAYERS THE ADVISES THE DIRECTORS ALL OF HIM SHOULD HAVE SEEN SOMETHING OF THIS COMING IN THE CENTRAL QUESTION FOR ME IS FOR PHILIP GREEN
DID HE KNOWINGLY SELL A BUSINESS A STRUGGLING BUSINESS TO RANK AMATEUR AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ITS EMPLOYEES ITS PENSIONS WERE DOOMED AND FOR DOMINIC SHAP HELD INQUIRY SHOULD FOCUS ON WHETHER HE HAD ANY INTENTION OF TRYING TO TURN B.H.S. ROUND DID HE REALLY TRIED TO DO THAT OR DID HE TAKE AS MUCH CASH AS HE COULD FROM THE BUSINESS BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATORS STEPPED IN TO FREEZE THE ACCOUNT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THIS IS LIKE IF YOU LIKE THE THE ORDER

NO LADY GREEN THE DEAL WAS APPARENTLY I'LL COME AND ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T SUMMON HER SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ENJOY IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES
THE THREAT OF CYBER ATTACKS IS NOW GREATER THAN THAT FROM TERRORISM THAT'S WITH THE U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR HE SINCE WARNED THAT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE BEING TARGETED BY CYBER HACKERS WORKING FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS LAST WEEK THE CHAIR OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SAID CYBER SECURITY WAS NOW THE BIGGEST RISK FACING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
SO HOW IS AMERICA HOW SHOULD WE ALL BE DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS CHRISTOPHER PAINTER IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ADVISER ON CYBER ISSUE HE'S THE COORDINATOR FOR CYBER ISSUES AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT STATE HE'S A RADIO CAR NOW OVER HERE FOR A CHATHAM HOUSE CONFERENCE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING WILL BE WITH YOU THIS THIS IDEA THAT THE THREAT OF CYBER ATTACKS NOW IS SO GREAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OFTEN CRIMINAL
WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT THREAD ACTRESS WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND SUS ISSUE AND THE CHALLENGE ONLY BECOME GREATER AS WE BECOME MORE DEPENDENT ON THESE TECHNOLOGIES SO THE THREAD OUTERS CAN BE EVERYTHING FROM NATION STATES TO TRANS NATIONAL ORGANISED CRIMINAL GROUPS TO A SORT OF LONE GUNMAN HACKER RISEN ARE AND THEY BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED WERE CLEVER ARE AS WE'VE BECOME MORE DEPENDENT OF COURSE WE'VE DONE A LOT TO TRY TO TO TO MUTE THOSE CHALLENGERS BUT THEY CONTINUE AND SO HOW SUCCESSFUL HAVE THEY
SO I DECIDED TO THINK THAT THIS IS THIS IS A BIT OF A EVERYTHING HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I USED TO BE A PROSECUTOR DOING THESE KINDS OF CASES AND WHEN I I'VE SEEN IS THAT CERTAINLY WE'VE DONE A LOT MORE TO ART TO STRENGTHEN OUR SYSTEMS TO HAVE BETTER PASSES EMPLOYERS BLOSSOM VERY TACTICAL MEASURES AND POISE NOT JUST OF THE UNITED STATES ARE BUT ALSO IN THE U.K. AND AROUND THE WORLD AND A STAR TREATING THIS ISSUE IS NOT JUST A TECHNICAL ISSUE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT IT WAS TRUE THAT'S BEFORE
BUT REALLY RECORD ISSUE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY ECONOMIC PASSING IN FOR HIM SO CERTAINLY THE CHANDLERS ARE BECOMING GREATER BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MEET THEM IS ALSO BECOMING MORE ORGANISED IN TERMS OF NATIONAL STRATEGIES IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION BECAUSE WHAT THERE WILL BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ALMOST A TREATY WILL THERE BE IF COUNTRIES ARE TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER BECAUSE THESE THINGS BY THEIR VERY NATURE ARE CROSS BORDER
THEY ARE INDEED CROSS BORDER IT DOES REQUIRE A REALLY UNPRECEDENTED INTERNATIONAL CO OPERATION I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A GLOBAL TREATY OR ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL TO DEAL WITH US I THINK THERE ARE SOME TREES AND PLACE OF SOMETHING CALLED THE BUDAPEST CONVENTION ON CYBER CRIME WHICH WE ENCOURAGE EVERY COUNTRY TO SIGN UP TO DO AND INDEED THE U.K. AND THE U.S. REMEMBERS I'VE HAD AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET ESPECIALLY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD TO DO THIS AND WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD SO THEY CAN DEAL WITH THIS THREAT
AT THE SAME TIME SOMETIMES PEOPLE TIED ABOUT A TREATY THEY'VE TRIED ABOUT A TREATY ARE TO CONTROL CYBERSPACE AND THERE IS A WORRY THAT COUNTRIES WHO WERE MORE WORRIED ABOUT NOT SO MUCH THE PHYSICAL OR THE SECURITY THE ASSISTANCE BUT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION ITSELF AS A THREAT BUT A TREATY WOULD BE DEALING WITH US CAN'T HAD ISSUES SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS PROMOTING A MORE CAPACITY BUILDING BUT I
SIR IN THE RULES OF BEHAVIOUR MORE INTO THE BEHAVIOUR OF AUNT TERRI NO ANSWERED BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE BUT AS WE GET MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES TO SIGN UP TO THOSE NORMS AND MAKES THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT BY STABLE SO WE DO THAT WE WORK A BIT OF CYBER CRIME PREVENTION R. AND HAVING WAS EMPLOYERS
A BETTER CO OPERATION INTERNATIONAL HAD TO DEAL WITH THESE THREATS BUT AS FAR AS INTERNATIONAL WEREN'T FAR AS SECURITY IS CONCERNED ISN'T THERE IN A SENSE AN ARMS RACE GOING ON THAT ACTUALLY IN AMERICA JUST AS MUCH AS CHINA IS COMPETING IN THIS ARMS RACE TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS UP TO
I THINK EVERY COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BEST FRIEND OURSELVES AND AND PART OF THAT IS AGAIN DONNING BETTER TACTICAL DEFENCE AS PART OF A DIS HAVING BETTER POLICIES AND NATIONALIST STRAUSS AND POINTERS BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A DIAL ON BOTH WITH THE COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE LIKE MINDED LIKE THE U.K. BUT ALSO THE COUNTRIES WHO WE VIEW AS BOTH COUNTRIES WE CAN DEAL WITH BUT ARSE COUNTRIES WHO WERE THREATS
THE OTHER THING THEN OR THE BEDROOM NATIONAL TAJ AND START ABOUT WAS THERE A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING CHINA WHO HAVE CAPABILITIES IMPOSE A THREAD WE HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL SUMMIT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT OBAMA PRESIDENT SHE AND I KNOW THERE WAS ONE WITH OUR PANS TO CAMERON CAMERON AS WELL
WHERE WE SECURED A COMMITMENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HACKING INTO A COMMERCIAL CIRCA SECTOR FOR PURPOSES ARE BENEFITING OTHER COMMERCIAL SECTOR OF THE OTHER COUNTRY THAT WAS SO WHAT CONTAINS JUST ONE IS A FINE BUT COMMERCIAL PUT PUT THAT TO ONE SIDE
I THINK COMMERCIAL OR SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T THINK ANY COUNTRY SHOULD DO WITH WITHIN BUT THAT GOES AT THE HEART OF OUR ECONOMIC AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT OF COURSE IS THAT STATE HACKING IS FINE IF YOU'RE SPYING ON ANOTHER GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE GATHERING HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AS LONG AS I THINK ANY OF US HAVE WORK LONG BEFORE ONLY RUSSELL WILL DO SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE HOWEVER WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING ARTIST NEEDS TO DO AS GOOD A JOB AS POSSIBLE ACTUALLY PROTECTING HER SYSTEM SO THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN CHRISTOPHER PAINTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME KNOW IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE WELL WE'VE BEEN ON AIR PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS LIFTING ITS ARMS EMBARGO ON ITS EMBARGO ON ARMS EXPORTS TO VIETNAM IT'S FORMER ENEMY PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN VIETNAM AT THE MOMENT HE WAS SPEAKING IN HANOI AFTER TALKS WITH THE COUNTRY'S LEADERS I CAN ALSO ANNOUNCE THAT
UNITED STATES IS FOLLY LIFTING THE BAN ON THE SALE MEANT TO VIETNAM THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR SOME FIFTY YEARS
AS WE'VE ALL HEARD THE FENCE PARTNERS SALES WILL NEED TO MEET STRICT REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS
BUT THIS CHANGE WILL ENSURE THAT EXCESS TO THE EQUIPMENT NEEDS TO DEFEND ITSELF WE'RE JOINED BY OUR CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HEAD WHO IS IN HANOI AND JONATHAN DO WE THINK THIS IS GOING TO MEAN A SUDDEN PICK UP IN TRADE WITH AMERICA SELLING WHAT IS STILL A COMMUNIST REGIME MILITARY EQUIPMENT
I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S GOING TO BE FAST THIS IS STILL A COUNTRY WHICH BUYS ITS WEAPONS FROM ANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR A LOT OF SOVIET STUFF LEFT OVER FROM THE DAYS OF THE COLD WAR WHEN THIS WAS A RUSSIAN ALLY IT DOES MEAN THAT THE N. I'M GETS ACCESS TO THINGS IT'S REALLY INTERESTING PARTICULARLY SOPHISTICATED COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA REFERRED TO INTERESTINGLY PATROL BOATS AND COASTGUARD EQUIPMENT NOW THAT'S VERY RELEVANT BECAUSE
THIS IS REALLY THE REASON FOR THIS THIS EXTRAORDINARY EMBRACE OF THESE TWO FORMER ENEMIES VIETNAM IS IN DISPUTE WITH CHINA IT'S NORTHERN NEIGHBOUR OVER ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IN FACT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION ARE THEY'VE BEEN UNABLE TO STOP CHINA'S VERY ASSERTIVE EXPANSION ON THOSE ISLAND IT'S BUILDING OF FACILITIES AND IT SUITS THEM A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE
IF THEY SEE IT AS BALANCING REALLY BETWEEN THE DOMINANCE OF CHINA BUT BRINGIN A SUPERPOWER LIKE AMERICA THE AMERICANS WANT TO WHAT HE'S PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS U.S. INFLUENCE TO EXPAND HERE WANTS TO COUNT CHINA IT'S THAT CONTEXT THAT REALLY IN TRUMPS THE OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO ARMS SALES THEY WANT A BETTER ARMS RELATIONSHIP AND THEY WANT A BIGGER ONE WHAT A LOT OF TRADE AS WELL AND IT'S SO IT'S A MOVE TOWARDS A SORT OF MORE NORMALISATION WITH THE COUNTRY
IT'S HISTORICALLY VERY IMPORTANT YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS ACTUALLY PUTS TO BED THE VERY LAST VESTIGE OF THE ISOLATION AND HOSTILITY THAT CAME AFTER THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THESE TWO COUNTRIES COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT IT'S A STILL A ONE PARTY STATE VERY SECRETIVE WHERE DISSIDENTS ARE LOCKED UP AND PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL RAISE THESE ISSUES WILL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THEM BUT THE FACT IS THEY NEED EACH OTHER IN A FAST CHANGING REGION WHERE CHINA'S POWER AND GROWING POWER GROWING EVERY YEAR IT'S A REALITY AND SO
THEY PUT THE THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS NOT COMPLETELY ASIDE BUT AT LEAST PUT THEM IN SECOND PLACE AND PUT THE NEED FOR A GROWING STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP AND REMEMBER VIETNAM IS ALSO ONE OF THE FOUNDER MEMBERS OF THEIR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AMBITIOUS TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP ON TRADE IT'S THE BIGGEST SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRY THAT'S JOINED IT AND SO IT IS NOW IRONICALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF THE HISTORY CONSIDERED PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING ALLIES FOR THE U.S. IN THIS REGION

NOW LET'S HEAR FROM PEOPLE WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF THE CARE SYSTEM ITSELF ADAN COIN JOIN IS ON THE LINE IS FROM THE CARE LEAVERS ASSOCIATION AND JOINS US FROM SALFORD AND OLIVIA PINK JOINT AS WELL
CHIEF CONSTABLE OF HAMPSHIRE POLICE AND THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEFS COUNCILS LID ON CHILDREN OR DARREN FIRST OF ALL SORRY I MIS PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME DARREN WELCOME TO YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE THE HUGE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE IN CUSTODY ABOUT HER HEART OFF WHO WERE ONCE IN CARE
OF COURSE YOU SURPRISING SURPRISING THAT SO MANY CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO CARE BY THE STAIRS TO BE PARENTED BETTER THAN WHAT THEY WERE PARENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN CUSTODY THAT'S YOU'VE GOT IT
MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF MY OWN IT'S BEEN IS GOING BACK A LONG LONG WAY ARE PROBABLY NOT EVEN REFLECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS TODAY HAVE A VERY SIMILAR IN SOME RESPECTS TO LOTS OF DIE YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW ADULTS THAT I WORK WITH TODAY UNFORTUNATELY OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY HAS PASSED SINCE SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU WERE TAKEN INTO CARE AW WHAT ABOUT AGE
NO I'VE BEEN IN CARE MOST OF MY LIFE WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND IS THERE A DANGER THEN AND NOW
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN IN CARE SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF DIFFICULT BEHAVIOUR NOT ALWAYS OF COURSE BUT SOMETIMES THAT IN A SENSE YOU'RE WRITTEN OFF BEFORE YOU BEGIN THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU ARE YOU A BAD KID YOU'RE GOING TO CAUSE TROUBLE
I GUESS THERE'S PRACTITIONERS PEOPLE THAT I'M NOT QUALIFIED ENOUGH TO RECOGNISE TRAUMATIC BEHAVIOUR PARTICULARLY RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS DEFINED IT AS CHALLENGING BEHAVIOUR AND SOMETIMES DEVIANT AND IT LEADS TO THE AWFUL CRIMINAL NOVEL CROME CRIMINALISATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE CARE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY YOU MIGHT FIND THEM REMANDED IN CUSTODY OR IN A SECURE UNIT THAT'S CRITICAL IT OLIVIA PYGMY ISN'T IT CHIEF CONSTABLE OF COURSE WE HEARD EARLIER THAT IN ONE CASE THE POLICE WERE CALLED WHEN A TEENAGER
RAIDED THE FRIDGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOR FOOD OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER BEHAVIOUR THIS INDIVIDUAL BEEN UP TO IN RECENT TIMES HAD BEEN BUT IS IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY OVERREACTION
I FIRST OF ALL LORD LEMMINGS REPORT IS REALLY DEEP AND HE'S REALLY NEW WANTS DIDN'T AND I REALLY WELCOME IT IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE POLICING FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT'S A REAL FOCUS FOR US IT'S ONE OF OUR FOUR FOUR FOCUS AREAS AND ABSOLUTELY WHAT DARREN DESCRIBES AROUND POLICE AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS DO NEEDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TRAUMA IN EARLY LIFE WHICH IS OFTEN THE VERY REASON THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN THE CARE SYSTEM
THEIR BEHAVIOUR IS BENEFIT HOW IT MANIFESTS ITSELF AND ISN'T SEEN AS TROUBLED AND DIFFICULT SO I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH DARREN THERE BUT THERE'S A NOT ABOUT THAT EXAMPLE COS IT IS A WEE ANIMAL AND SPECIFIC ABSOLUTELY NO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HAPPENS AND THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHERS LIKE IT THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND LORD LEHMAN'S REPORT VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATE
ONE IS WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF CALLS TO POLICE EVERY YEAR FROM FROM CHILDREN'S HOMES SOME OF THEM OF COURSE ARE REALLY DANGEROUS AND PEOPLE ARE VERY FRIGHTENED OF COURSE BUT ACTUALLY A LOT ARE THAT IS THE CASE YOU DESCRIBED TO ME THAT'S NOT A JOB FOR THE POLICE SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LOVE IT THAT WE'RE NOT CALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE FRANKLY AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY AROUND THE COUNTRY THERE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES
WHERE PEOPLE WHO RUN CHILDREN'S HOMES AND THE LOCAL POLICE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO STOP THE POLICE BEING CALLED THE POLICE BEING THE ANSWER TO WHAT IN MY HOME WITH MY TEENAGER WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING I'D EVER RING THE POLICE ABOUT THE MALES DOWN BRIEFLY IF WE COOK AS WERE VERY SHORT OF TIME I'M AFRAID DOWN WHAT SHOULD BE THE REACTION OF HER HOME IN THAT SITUATION IF THEY DON'T CALL THE POLICE
THERE SHOULD BE SOME RESTORATIVE OUTCOME IF A CHILD FROZEN MOBILE FOR OUT OF ANGER AND A DOLL OR A WINDOW GETS BROKEN THAT SHOULDN'T INVOLVE THE POLICE BEEN CALLED HER SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH IN THE HOUSE IF HE WAS AT HOME YOU'D HAVE YOUR POCKET MONEY DOCTOR HE'D BE SENT TO BED YOU'D BE GROUNDED THINGS WOULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOME RESTORATIVE OUTCOME IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN A CHILDREN'S ARM AS WELL IF HE DOESN'T IT'S DISCRIMINATION AGAINST CHILDREN IN CHILDREN'S ARMS FORGIVE ME IT'S ABOUT TEN SECONDS EACH BUT
THIS JUST SOUNDS LIKE COMMON SENSE DOESN'T IT A LIVE BEEPING ME AGREE I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING AND THE OTHER THING OF COURSE ALL AGENCIES NEED IS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH THE RIGHT INFORMATION SO PUT SOME SPEED BUMPS INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SO THEY'RE COOL AND CONSIDERED AND WE DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE ROUND VERY BRIEF GLASSWARE DAMN PLATE YEAH I JUST THINK HE NEEDS TO BE
A GREATER NEED TO RECOGNISE JUST SOME COMMONSENSE OUTCOMES WERE WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE TRAUMATISED AND THEN LABEL THEM AS DEVIANT AND TROUBLESOME RATHER THAN TROUBLED IS THE NEGATIVE AND WRONG AND WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE HARING TOILET SYSTEM OR LIVIA THANK YOU SO MUCH OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE LAURA COOPER AND TIM DIFFER FROM US ALL HAVE A VERY GOOD MORNING
