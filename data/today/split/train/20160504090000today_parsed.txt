THE CONTROVERSIAL U.S. BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP IS NOW ALMOST CERTAIN TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AFTER HIS MAIN RIVAL TED CRUISE WITHDREW FOLLOWING ANOTHER HEAVY DEFEAT THE RESULT IN INDIANA MEANS IT WOULD NOW BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MISTER TRUMP'S OPPONENTS TO FORCE A CONTEST OF THE PARTY'S CONVENTION HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHNSON

PETER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS THERE QUITE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEADS THIS MORNING THE DAILY MAIL IN THE TELEGRAPH PICK UP ON A STORY THAT WAS THAT SHE DISCLOSED BY THE NEW SCIENTIST WHICH IS THAT UP TO ONE POINT SIX MILLION PATIENTS N.H.S. PATIENTS HAVE HAD THEIR PRIVATE MEDICAL FILES PASSED TO GOOGLE WITHOUT THEIR EXPLICIT PRINT PERMISSION
THEY IN THE GOOGLE WAS GIVEN THE DATA BY AN N.H.S. TRUST TO DEVELOP AND TO MONITOR POSSIBLE KIDNEY FAILURE AND IT SHOULD BE CLAIMING THE N.H.S. TRUST SAYS LOOK THEY DIDN'T SELL THE FILES NO MONEY CHANGED HANDS THE DATA'S ENCRYPTED IT'S PROCESSED ONLY BY A COMPUTER THERE'S NO CHANCE OF IT BEING LEAKED ONLINE AND IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON WHICH IS THAT IN THEORY GOOGLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AN ACT WHICH HELPS IDENTIFY
THE POSSIBLE KIDNEY FAILURE BUT OF COURSE IT'S RAISED ALL SORTS OF CONCERNED BY PEOPLE SAYING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND OF THEIR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF GOOGLE PROCESSING THE INFORMATION IN THIS WAY IS A QUOTE FROM ONE G. P. AND OF COURSE AN AWFUL LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IT GETTING INTO THE WRONG HANDS BUT ALL THE PAPERS MAKE WALLPAPER MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S A MODEL THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE FOLLOWED IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL FOR OTHER
CONDITIONS AND IN BY OTHER TRUSTS THE TELEGRAPH LEAD IS A LETTER TO THEM FROM THE CHIEF RABBI THE HEADLINE THEY PUT ON IT IS CHIEF RABBI DREAM LABOUR'S POISON AND IN THE LETTER THE CHIEF RABBI AIRFRAME URBIS KNOWN FROM THOUGHT FOR THE DAY OF COURSE SAYS THAT IN RECENT DAYS WE'VE HEARD ANTI CEMETERIES IN THE LABOUR PARTY
DESCRIBED VARIOUSLY AS A SMEAR AND AS MOOD MUSIC BEING MANIPULATED BY POLITICAL OPPONENTS ARE JEREMY CORBIN THERE'S NOTHING MORE DISHEARTENING IN THIS STORY HE WRITES THAN THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS IS MORE ABOUT POLITICS THAN ABOUT SUBSTANCE THE WORST MISTAKES AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WILL BE TO TREATED AS A POLITICAL ATTACK WHICH REQUIRES A POLITICAL SOLUTION
ANOTHER STORY IN THE PAPERS THIS MORNING I'M NOT LEAST IN PAGE THREE OF THE MALE IS THE STORY OF THE LEGO AND BASS
THE ADVENTURER BEN FOGLE WHO SAID THAT MODERN EGOS HARMING CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT AND STIFLING CREATIVITY BECAUSE OF THEIR PRESCRIPTIVE BUILD IT YOURSELF KITS THE ONE THAT SAVED STEP ONE DO THIS STEP TWO STEP AND HE SAID
HE MEANT NO DISRESPECT TO LEGO BUT SELLING ITS TOY BROOKS BRICKS IN COOKIE CUTTER KIT FORMS ARE CREATED BOUNDARIES AND LIMITS ON CHILDREN'S IMAGINE IMAGINATION THEN THIS IS THE MAN WHO IS A BRAND AMBASSADOR AT LEAST AND WASP EDWARD'S NAME AS ONE FOUR YEARS AGO AND SAYS IT'S RULING THE WORLD THE PAPERS WERE PRINTED TOO EARLY TO GET THE LATEST NEWS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON POLITICS THE TIMES THOSE SAYS SEE SORRY TO TRUMP
OR RISK SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP CAMERON IS TOLD THIS IS A FOREIGN AFFAIRS ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP WHO'S AS WE DON'T NEED AN INVITATION FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM WE NEED AN APOLOGY FROM DAVID CAMERON WHO DOBBED MISTER TRUMP'S CALL FOR A WALL WITH MEXICO'S DIVISIVE STUPID AND WRONG TEN PAST SIX THAT IS THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING THERE IS NO STOPPING HIM NOW
THERE WAS ONE FINAL HURDLE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP IN A BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WAS IN INDIANA HE HAS THOUGH NOW LEAPT OVER IT FOR STING THE LAST MAN WHO THOUGHT HE COULD BLOCK HIM TED CREWS TO ACCEPT THAT IT IS ALL OVER FROM THE BEGINNING THAT SAID THAT I WOULD CONTINUE ON AS LONG AS THERE WAS A VIABLE PATH TO VICTORY
TONIGHT I'M SORRY TO SAY IT APPEARS THAT PATH HAS BEEN FORECLOSED
I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT AS THEY CLEARED UP AFTER THE VICTORY RALLY AT THE TRUMP TOWER SKYSCRAPER IN NEW YORK
INDIANA HAD BEEN THE STATE WHETHER STOP FRONT FORCES BELIEVED THAT THEY COULD DEPRIVE HIM OF THE ALL IMPORTANT DELEGATES HE NEEDS TO REACH THE MAGIC NUMBER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN
ONE THEY'RE IN AN ABSOLUTE LANDSIDE OR REMEMBER IT WAS A HEAD TO HEAD CONTEST WITH TECH CREW'S GONE CASE IC THE OTHER REPUBLICAN THE RACE DECIDED TO LEAVE
THE COAST'S CLEAR FOR TECH CREW'S AND THERE WAS NOTHING THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THROWN AT TRUMP THAT TED CREWS DID NOT THROW AT HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD BEEN SAID IN PRIVATE THAT HAD BEEN MUTTERED WAS SAID PUBLICLY AND DIRECTLY AT TRUMP BUT IT DIDN'T WORK AND IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THE CAMPAIGN REACHED A LEVEL OF UGLINESS AND VICIOUSNESS THAT EVEN BY THE STANDARDS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARILY BRUTAL AND UGLY CAMPAIGN
REACHED A NEW LEVEL IT REALLY DID GO NUCLEAR FRUMPY EVEN ACCUSED TAKE CRUISES FATHER OF HAVING SOME CONNECTION WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD THE ASSASSIN OF J.F.K. FOR DONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTE EXTRAORDINARY HE'S PULLED UP ON THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY HE'S PULLED OFF THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE LOCKER THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT CAN DO TO STOP DONALD TRUMP THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE WHICH BASICALLY ORGANISES ALL THE PRIMARIES IT'S THE MAIN GOVERNING BODY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
SAID TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE THAT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT SORT OF CONFERRING THAT TITLE UPON HIM I MEAN THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY
REPUBLICANS THEY HATE THE IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP BEING THERE NOMINATE BUT MANY OF THEM HATE IT EVEN MORE SPIRITS CRUISE BEING THAT NOBODY BUT DONALD TRUMP
DID MAKE A CALL FOR UNITY TONIGHT HE DID CALL FOR THE G.O.P. THE GRAND OLD PARTY TO COME TOGETHER BUT NICK FOR MONTHS IT HAS BEEN IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE OPEN CIVIL WAR AND THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM
AS A REPUBLICAN PARTY THINKS ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO CONTEST THIS GENERAL ELECTION AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IT BRIAN OR CLEARING OUT TRUMP TOWER BEHIND YOU WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN CLEAR YOU OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO RECOMMEND TODAY THAT TURKISH PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL FREELY IN THE SHOWING AN AREA OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT A VISA BY THE END OF NEXT MONTH CHRIS MORRIS IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT AND CHRIS THIS IS QUITE A MOMENT PARDON PART OF THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK OVER OVER REFUGEES THAT AS FAR AS REFUGEES AS CONCERNED OR AT LEAST WHAT THE E.U. WANTED HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
YEAH WHEN YOU APPLIED TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THERE IS A PATHWAY OPEN TO THIS BETA LIBERALISATION PROCESS WHAT THE REFUGEE DEAL DID WAS ACCELERATE IT FOR TURKEY TURKEY WANTED THE DATE BROUGHT FORWARD IT ON WHICH IT CITIZENS COULD TRAVEL FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS ONLY THEY CAN'T COME AND WORK PERMANENTLY AT IT'S A THREE MONTH VISA
IN THAT THE COUNTRIES IN THE SHANNON AREA SO NOT INTO THE U.K. WHAT TURKEY'S DONE IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ACCORDING TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS THIS HIS MEAT A LOT OF THE CRITERIA WHICH HAVE BEEN LAID OUT AND THERE ARE SEVENTY TWO SEPARATE THINGS IT HAS TO DO IN ORDER TO FULFIL THE CONDITIONS FOR THIS VISA LIBERALISATION IT'S MET MOST OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM YET
AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE THINGS LIKE IT'S LEGAL APPLICATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WHICH AS YOU KNOW IN TURKEY AT THE MOMENT IS A PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THERE ARE ALSO THINGS LIKE ROLLING OUT BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS FOR EVERYBODY THAT PROCESS UNDER WAY BELOVED IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME
OVERALL THOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS YES TURKEY IS MEETING ITS SIDE OF THE BARGAIN THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE CROSSING FROM THE TURKISH COAST TO THE GREEK ISLANDS HAVE FALLEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEREFORE IT IS RECOMMENDING TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND Y. YOU GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY TOO SHOULD AGREE ON THIS THESE ARE LIBERALISATION BY THE END OF JUNE BUT THE IDEA THAT TURKEY CAN PROVE WITHIN A ROCK WITHIN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD THAT IT CAN PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THAT'S A BIT CHALLENGING ISN'T IT
IT IS A BIT CHALLENGING IT'LL BE VERY CHALLENGING IN PLACES LIKE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND IN SEVERAL NATIONAL CAPITALS THERE ARE DEEP SEATED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROCESS SOME OF THEM CERTAINLY TO DO IT WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO DO WITH PROTECTION OF MINORITIES I THINK IN SOME CAPITALS IT'S MORE THE FEAR OF
WHAT THIS WILL DO TO THE DEBATE INTERNAL DEBATE IN THOSE COUNTRIES ABOUT IMMIGRATION WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE FRONT NASTY AND ALAN FRANCE TRYING TO MAKE POLITICAL CAPITAL ON THIS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THIS DEAL MAY HAVE PREVENTED ANOTHER MILLION SYRIANS FROM ARRIVING IN EUROPE BUT IT'S POTENTIALLY OPENING THE DOOR TO SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY MILLION TURKS
AS I SAY THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY FULL TIME IT'S A THREE MONTH THESE ARE THREE MONTH ABILITY TO COME TO EUROPE FOR THREE MONTHS WITHOUT A VISA AND THERE'S ALREADY COUNTRIES SAYING
PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS IF THE NUMBERS PITTUCK BECOME TOO GREAT SHOULD WE HAVE SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY BRAKE ON THIS BUT THE MESSAGE FROM TURKEY IS VERY VERY CLEAR WE WANT TO BE TREATED EQUALLY LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES WHO HAVE THESE THESE ARE LIBERALISATION SCHEMES
AND IF WE'RE NOT WHY ON EARTH SHOULD WE KEEP OUR SIDE OF THE BARGAIN WHICH ISN'T AN EVENT THIS VAST FLOW OF MIGRANTS FROM TURKEY TO THE GREEK ISLAND SO IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT DECISION FOR THE E.U. TO MAKE THERE IS CONCERNED THERE IS ANXIETY ABOUT
OPTING FOR THESE OR LIBERALISATION IF THEY BLOCK IT IN ANY WAY THOUGH HE HAS A REAL LEVER OF OVERS Y. YOU AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MIGRANT FLO CHRIS MORRIS THANKS VERY MUCH IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX TONY BACK IT IT WITH THE BUSINESS NEEDS MORE A GOOD MORNING YES WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING FROM SAINSBURY THIS MORNING BUT ALSO WE KNOW PHILIP GREEN
OF B.H.S. FORMERLY OF B.H.S. HAS AGREED TO APPEAR BEFORE PARLIAMENT AND THIS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE HIGH STREET RETAILER AS I SAY B. H. S. LADY GREEN APPARENTLY PLANS TO GET HER IN FRONT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN DROPPED THE QUESTION IS WHAT THIS MIGHT ACHIEVE MORE IN HINTON IS GLOBAL RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT VERDICT SHE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MAUREEN
THERE'S MUCH MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT FLOWS IN AND OUT OF CASH FROM B.H.S. LOANS DIVIDENDS AND SO ON DURING THEIR TENURE OF NOT ONLY PHILIP GREEN BUT ALSO HIS SUCCESSOR
ONE WONDERS REALLY WHETHER AN APPEARANCE BEFORE A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE WOULD ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE A CASE OF THE MORAL HIGH GROUND REALLY IT IS LOOKING AT THE MORALE MORALITY OF OF THIS
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL EXCEPT TO BRING CLARITY OF WHEN WHEN DIFFERENCES WERE TAKEN OUT WHEN THE PENSION FUND STARTED TO GO INTO DEFICIT WHY NOT IT'S NOT EVIDENT FROM THE ACCOUNTS WHICH OF COURSE HAVE TO BE SIGNED OFF BY ACCOUNTANTS SHOULD BE EVIDENT FROM THE CATS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY PUTTING INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH TALK ABOUT IT AT THE MOMENT AND PARLIAMENT
LATCHING ON TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOT A GREAT DEAL OF MEDIA COVERAGE SO IF THEY ARE THEY'RE THEREFORE ABLE TO EXCEL MORAL PRESSURE AND CLAW SOME MONEY BACK WHAT MIGHT THAT ACHIEVE FOR THE FUTURE OF B.H.S. WERE OF COURSE MIKE ACTUALLY AT THE MOMENT AND SPORTS DIRECT IS SAYING THAT HE MIGHT BUY IT IN FI NOBODY
I THINK WHAT I THINK THAT RESURRECTING B.H.S. WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S IN THAT MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE DON'T REALLY SHOP ANY MORE WE SHOP AT SUPERMARKETS WE SHOP ONLINE WE SHOP AT SPECIALISTS TO REVIVE B.H.S. IN THE FORM THIS IN AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HARD BECAUSE IT'S MIDDLE MARKET YES BECAUSE IT'S MIDDLE MARKET IT'S LIKE LITTLEWOODS OR C. N. A. OF THE PAST ALL THOSE THOSE BIG
MASS MARKET MIDDLE MARKET RETAILERS HAVE I'VE JUST BEEN SQUEEZED BY DIFFERENT FORMS OF SHOPPING OH KAY LET'S GO TO ANOTHER PART OF THE RETAIL MARKET AND THAT IS SAINSBURY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FULLY RESULTS FROM THEM TODAY WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING WELL WE'RE EXPECTING THAT THE PROFITS TO BE HIT BY THE CURRENT PRICE WARS IN END GROCERY
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE DOWN TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION FROM OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DOES PREVALENT ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE GROCERY SECTOR AND WHAT SAINSBURY OF COURSE HE'S TAKEN OVER THE ARGOS GROUP AND IT WANTS TO BE IT SAYS BIGGER THAN AMAZON OR AT LEAST THAT WILL MAKE IT BIGGER THAN AN AMAZON SO IN CONSUMER TERMS CUSTOMER TURNS THAT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A A LAND GRAB
YES IT DOES BUT THE THING IS IT WON'T MAKE IT AM SO IT'S GOING TO MET GIVE IT MUCH MORE ACCESS TO ONLINE MUCH MORE ACCESS TO THE FULFILMENT OF A COSTS BUT IT DOES HAVE TO HAVE THAT THE PRODUCTS OFFER THAT IS IT GOING TO EXCITE ITS CUSTOMERS AND NO ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT ARCAS ISN'T ACTUALLY DELIVERING THAT AT THE MOMENT NO INTERESTINGLY THOSE SAINSBURY'S CLOTHES HAVE BEEN DOING WELL AND THAT SUGGESTS A LITTLE BIT ADDS WEIGHT TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE ABOUT B.H.S.
AND I THINK THAT IT'S AN EXTREMELY WELL ON THE CLOTHING SIDE IT'S GOT A VERY GOOD VERY GOOD OFFER AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S COME FROM A LOW BASE SO IT'S GOING REALLY WELL THERE WE MUST LEAVE IT MORE IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON THE MARKETS NOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SEEING A BIT OF A SELL OFF IT STARTED REALLY ON MONDAY WITH SOME DISAPPOINTING FIGURES FROM CHINA HE'S A PEA AND ICE FIGURES THAT CAME OUT PURCHASING MANAGES INDEX AND IT SEEMS JANE CINEMAS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO INVESTMENT DIRECTOR OF RATHBONE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IT SEEMS
THAT THIS IDEA OF NOT JUST OUR CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA BUT BROADLY MANUFACTURING SECTORS ACROSS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SEEMS TO BE SPREADING THE U.S. AND OF COURSE ALSO EUROPE YES I MEAN IT'S FOR SOME TIME ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING
NUMBERS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN DOWN CERTAINLY IN IT WAS STARTED BY CHINA I SUPPOSE AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD FALLING OIL AND COMMODITY PRICES WHICH INDICATE LESS DEMAND FOR THOSE COMPONENTS MANUFACTURING AND IT STILL SEEMS TO BE ONGOING WHILE SERVICES ARE STILL PERFORMING PRETTY WELL SO THAT
OF COURSE IF YOU LIKES CONTINUING SO WHY THE SHOP SELL OFF IF WE ACCEPT THAT CHINA IS MOVING WAR TOWARDS HER SERVICES ECONOMY WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK IT'S REALLY THE DELAY IN ALL THE SCENTS THAT INTEREST RATE RISES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE GOING TO BE DELAYED
I THINK THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT WE WOULD SEE THOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR AND MARKETS ARE OR SEEM TO BE A BIT LESS CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT WHICH IS PARTLY WHY WE'VE SEEN THE DOLLAR FALLING AND JUST JUST A SENSE REALLY FRONT FROM CORPORATE RESULTS THAT YOU KNOW THINGS ARE NOT GOING QUITE SO WELL SO WE DON'T NEED TO PUT RATES UP TO TO BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD THE LATEST FORECAST FOR EUROPE ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD AND WE'VE GOT SOME JOBS FIGURES OUT OF THE U.S. ON FRIDAY HAD MY THAT ALL ADD TO THE PICTURE
AGAIN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ONE AT ONE OF THE BRIGHT SPOTS HAS BEEN THE CONTINUING HIGH LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT NUMBER COMING THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER COMING DOWN AND STAYING DOWN AND I THINK IF ANYTHING MARKETS HAVE BEEN HANGING ON TO THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF CONFIDENCE SO SO IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT STATISTIC JANE IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WELL THE BIG FIVE BANKS ALL LENDERS HAVE BEEN REPORTING DROPS
IN PROFIT H.S.B.C. TALKS ABOUT DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS YESTERDAY THERE'S A REPORT OUT THIS MORNING SUGGESTING THE SO CALLED CHALLENGER BANKS ARE IN CONTRAST BY CONTRAST DOING RATHER WELL TOTAL PRE TAX PROFITS FOR CHALLENGER BANK SUCH AS T. S. VIRGIN MONEY METTRE BANK CLYDESDALE YORKSHIRE BANKING GROUP
ROSE BY ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION TO ONE POINT TWO EIGHT BILLION LAST YEAR THE BIG FIVES THOSE SAW A COMBINE PROFITS FOR ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS WHAT IS GOING ON BUT THE TEAM AT EIGHT K.P.M.G. HAVE BEEN CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS AND LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THIS WARREN MADE
HE'S HEAD OF CHALLENGER BANKING AT K. P. M. JOY K.P.M.G. AND JOINS US NOW FROM OUR STUDIOS IN GLASGOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGER BANKS DOING IS IT SIMPLY THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND THEREFORE INEVITABLY THEIR PROFITS RISE I WAS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT OH GOOD MORNING TANYA SO THEY'RE DOING TWO THINGS THEY ARE GROWING REALLY QUICKLY INTO PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT HAVE BEEN
UNDER SERVED FROM THE BIT BY THE BIG BANKS ARE WHERE THE BIG BANKS ARE WITHDRAWING BUT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY'RE DOING THAT IN A REALLY COST EFFECTIVE WAY SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THEY'RE OPERATING THEY'VE GOT FAR FEWER COSTS THAN MANY OF THE BIG BANKS HAVE THAT QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BACK OFFICE IN BANKS HAVE AT THE FRONT
WHEN WE GET ON TO OUR MOBILE PHONES AND COMPUTERS IT LOOKS FAIRLY SLICK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BACK OFFICE IS FAR LESS SLICK THEY HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY SYSTEMS IS THAT THE PROBLEM THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE THERE CERTAINLY OLD LEGACY SYSTEMS IN THE BIG BANK SOMETIMES TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS OLD BUT ALSO THE BIG BANKS HAVE BEEN BURDENED BY THESE HUGE COMPLIANCE OR MIS SELLING COSTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT'S REALLY HURTING THEIR PROFITABILITY AS WELL
IN THE END DO YOU THINK WE WILL I'M NOT JUST THINKING NOW ABOUT THE SO CALLED CHALLENGER BANKS BUT ALSO THIS NOTE'S FIN TECH SECTOR WHICH IS MUSHROOMS WHERE WILL BE THE LARGER BANKS GO WITH THAT WILL THEY TRY IT SEEK TO ABSORB ALL OF THAT CREATIVITY INTO INTO THEIR OPERATIONS BY BUYING THEM SIMPLY
WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPECT THE BANKS TO GO OUT AND BUY SOME OF THEIR FIN TAX AND SOME OF THE DIGITAL ONLY BANKS AND WE ALREADY SAW THAT FROM THE LIKES OF B.B. V. A. THE SPANISH BANK WHO BOUGHT A PART OF ATOM EARLIER IN THE YEAR BUT ALSO YOU CAN EXPECT THEM TO KIND OF WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH SOME OF THESE NEW BANKS AND THE ORGANISATIONS
TO TRY AND IMPROVE THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN THE BACK OFFICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US WARREN MADE OF K.P.M.G. WELL THERE'S A CALL THIS MORNING FOR BUSINESSES TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCAMS RATHER THAN LEAVING THE ONUS ON CUSTOMERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IT COMES FROM THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH WHICH IS URGING THE GOVERNMENT'S JOINT FRAUD TASK TO REVIEW HOW BUSINESSES
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE SCANNED WHICH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RICHARD LLOYD JOINS US NOW ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU ONE SO HOW COULD COMPANIES TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY JUST IF YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A PARTICULAR SCAM AND THINKING OF ONE BUT I NEARLY FELL PREY TO YESTERDAY AND THAT IS THAT I WAS ASKED I WAS TOLD THAT PARTICULAR ACCOUNT WAS DEACTIVATED AND ASKED TO PUT IN MY DETAILS TO REACTIVATE IT FORTUNATELY I DIDN'T DO IT
WELL THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF THESE SCAMS THERE'S A SCAM A MINUTE REPORTED AND MANY MORE THAT GO UNREPORTED WE FOUND ABOUT SIX IN TEN PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE BEEN TARGETED BY THAT KIND OF ONLINE FRAUD IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS AND WE'RE AND BECOMING SORRY IS THAT AS AT BECOMING THE MOST PREVALENT TYPE OF FRAUD
IT IS FASTEST GROWING AND IT IS BECOMING THE MOST COMMON BECAUSE OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF FRAUD TRAFFIC SO MANY OF US ARE TRYING TO SHOP ONLINE AT THE MOMENT SO MANY OF US ARE GETTING THESE DUBIOUS PHISHING EMAILS CALLS AS WELL BUT IT'S BECOME SUCH A BIG PROBLEM NOW EVEN THE SAVVY CONSUMER PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE WORTH THINKING TWICE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THE SHOPPING ONLINE YEAH THERE'S SO MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF
BUT IN THE END IT'S BECOMING SO SOPHISTICATED AND SO PREVALENT PROBLEM WE THINK BUSINESSES NEED TO BE TAKING MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO RIGHT SO HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT HOW WOULD THAT WORK WE FOUND THAT IF SAY ONLINE RETAILERS IMPROVED THEIR CYBER SECURITY IF TECH DEVICES THAT WE BUY WERE MORE SECURE IF THERE WAS MORE TARGET HARDENING THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST TO STOP CARS BEING BROKEN INTO FOR EXAMPLE TO MAKE IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO STILL MOBILE PHONES
IF THAT APPROACH WAS TAKEN BY MORE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE ECONOMY BUT IT WOULD MAKE US MORE SECURE BUT IN THE END OF THIS GOVERNMENT TASK FORCE THAT'S LOOKING INTO THIS QUITE RIGHTLY IT'S FOCUSING TO START OFF WITH ON FINANCIAL FRAUD AND THE ROLE OF THE BANKS AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS BUT IF THE END IF THAT'S ALL WE FOCUS ON THEY WERE GONNA BE MISSING THIS ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF FRAUD
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CASES THAT GO ON REPORTED EVERY YEAR AND I'M A CUSTOMER IS A BEHIND THE CURVE ON A LOCK CUSTOMERS BUT COMPANIES ARE BEHIND THE CURVE ON THIS ONE SURELY IT'S IN THEIR INTERESTS IT IS IN THEIR INTEREST WE FOUND PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY'RE STARTING TO BE VERY WARY ABOUT BUYING THINGS ON LINE PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING SOMEONE LINE PRODUCT SOME APPS BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARING BECOMING A TARGET SO THERE'S A STRONG BUSINESS CASE
FOR COMPANIES TO WORK BETTER WITH THE POLICE WITH THE OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR THEIR ONLINE SERVICES ARE MUCH MORE SECURE TO GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE IN USING THEM AND IF WE COULD HAVE A GROWING DIGITAL ECONOMY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL WHICH IS WHY WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS TASK FORCE TO BE DRIVING MORE TO BE DONE TO MAKE MORE BUSINESSES AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO TO PROTECT PEOPLE AT THIS SAUCE RATHER THAN RELY ON THE CUSTOMER RICHARD LLOYD FROM WHICH THANK YOU VERY MUCH

MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE THE CANADIAN CITY OF FORT MCMURRAY WHICH IS BEING THREATENED BY A HUGE WILDFIRE THE AUTHORITIES IN ALBERTA ISSUED MASS EVACUATION ORDERS WITNESSES SO MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE FIRE
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR CARE HOMES IN THE U.K. IS AT RISK OF CLOSING WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE THE STUDY BY OPUS BUSINESS SERVICES FIRM THAT MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND CARE HOMES ARE UNDER THREAT
SOUTHERN HEALTH N.H.S.

M.P.S ARE CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP DITHERING OVER HIS CHOICE OF LOCATION FOR A NEW RUNWAY IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THE COMMONS TRANSPORT COMMITTEE SAYS THE DELAY IS DAMAGING ECONOMIC GROWTH MINISTERS ARGUE MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF EXPANDING HEATHROW OR GATWICK
THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY HAS DELAYED BY FIVE MONTHS NEW RULES THAT WILL REQUIRE BROADBAND SUPPLIERS TO MAKE THEIR COSTS CLEARER RESEARCH SUGGESTS MOST CONSUMERS CAN'T CORRECTLY CALCULATE THE TOTAL PRICE OF A CONTRACT BECAUSE OF HIDDEN COSTS
IT'S NOT TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN COULD THE GOVERNMENT BE ABOUT TO DO A U. TURN ON ALLOWING UNACCOMPANIED CHILD MIGRANTS INTO THE U.K. NORMAN SMITH AS A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN THIS FOLLOWS NOT PARTICULARLY FOLLOWS AT LEAST HAVE A VERY POWERFUL LETTER FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH REFUGEES
THIS IS A LETTER FROM SIR ERIC RYE HUGHES ASKED FOR A MEETING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHER SURVIVORS OF THE KINDER TRANSPORT SCHEME AND THE PRIME MINISTER AND IN A LETTER TO URGING THE PRIME MINISTER TO SHOW COMPASSION AND HUMAN KINDNESS AND IT IS PART OF THE
MOUNTING PRESSURE ON MISTER CAMERON TO GIVE WAY ON THIS ISSUE AHEAD OF MONDAY'S VOTE IN THE COMMONS WITH ALL THE SIGNS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO RETHINK BECAUSE ON THE TORY SIDE THERE COULD BE UP TO THIRTY TORY M.P.S ARE NOW PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST MY CAMERA BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A VOTE
THE ISSUE DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH TRACTION AS IT DOES NOW THERE'S BEEN A GOOD DEAL MORE LETTER WRITING AND PRESSURE FROM CONSTITUENTS WHICH HAS HARDENED THE VIEW OF TORY REBELS YVONNE WANTS TO CALL THEM THAT THE DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTY THEY ABSTAINED LAST TIME THIS TIME THEY'RE SET TO VOTE AGAINST THE OPINION IN THE COMMONS HAS HARDENED IF YOU LOOK AT PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS LAST WEEK WITH ANGUS ROBERTSON AND YVETTE COOPER BEING PUBLICLY CLAPPED WHEN THEY RAISE THE ISSUE WITH THE DAILY MAIL AS TAKEN UP CUDGELS ON BEHALF OF THE REFUGEES
THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF TORY M.P.S WHO JUST LIKE GIVING MY CAMERON A BLOODY NOSE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT EURO WARS IN THE PARTY SO ONE OF THE REBEL SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT STEADFAST RESISTANCE IS NOT GOING TO WORK AND NOW IT SEEMS THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER JAMES BROKEN CHAIR WILL MEET WITH THE REBELS THIS AFTERNOON TO TRY AND THRASH OUT SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE AMENDMENT BUT HE HAS TO MOVE SWIFTLY BECAUSE BASICALLY A DEAL HAS TO BE DONE BY THURSDAY CLOSER
PLAY TO GET IT ON THE ORDER PAPER FOR MONDAY'S VOTE SO THERE HAS TO BE A DEAL WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE E.U. WE'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY TALKING NUMBERS NUMBERS HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF IT BECAUSE IF YOU PUT NUMBERS IN THE ANY AMENDMENT THAT CREATES A COST IMPLICATION WHICH ENABLES THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY
BASICALLY THAT THE HOUSE OF LORDS CAN'T APPROVE IT SO THERE'S NOT A FIXED NUMBER ON IT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT I UNDERSTAND HE'S BEEFING UP THE SO CALLED DUBLIN THREE PROTOCOL BOILED DOWN THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE A SYRIAN REFUGEE OR A REFUGEE CAMP IN EUROPE AND YOU HAVE A RELATIVE IN BRITAIN YOU CAN APPLY TO COME TO BRITAIN BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S HUGELY COMPLEX CUMBERSOME SLOW AND IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP MANY CHILDREN VERY QUICKLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEM TO BE LOOKING AT DOING IS PILING MORE RESOURCES INTO THAT TO FAST TRACK THAT TO MAKE IT A SWIFT
SCHEME AND ALSO RELAXING THE RULES SO YOU CAN APPLY IF YOU HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY IN THE U.K. THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT MAY GET SOME TORY M.P.S ON BOARD BUT MANY OF MY CAMERON'S CRITICS ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THE CURRENT SORT OF DUBS AMENDMENT GOES FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE IT ONLY APPLIES TO REFUGEE CHILDREN THEY SAY AITCH APPLIED TO ALL UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN
AND THEY ALSO DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE LIMITED JUST UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU COULD BE A CHILD COMING HERE WITH YOUR BROTHER WHO'S TWENTY OR SO EVER SO WHILE MISTER CAMERON DOESN'T WANT TO CONCEDE IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE SOME GROUND NORMAN'S MY THANKS
IT IS IT IS SCUSE ME TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE WORDS REGIME OF CALM MAY RING A LITTLE HOLLOW TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND DIED THERE IN THE PAST TEN DAYS ALONE BUT THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI LAVROV SAYS MOSCOW HOPES THAT THAT'S WHAT'S IN PROSPECT FOR THE CITY IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS LAP OF COURSE IS A KEY MILITARY TARGET FOR RUSSIA'S ALLY SYRIA'S PRESIDENT ASAD A MAN IN MOSCOW IS STEVE ROSENBERG MORNING TO YOU STEVE ANY EXPLANATION FOR SURGERY LEVELS OPTIMISM
NOT REALLY WHEN HE DID SAY THAT A MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM RUSSIA AND AMERICA ARE WORKING HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO SPREAD THIS REGIME OF CALM TO ALEPPO AND YESTERDAY HE SUGGESTED AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED WITHIN HOURS BUT SO FAR THERE'S BEEN NO ANNOUNCEMENT OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT TO RUSSIA AND AMERICA HAVE SET UP THERE WERE A CEASEFIRE MONITORING CENTRE IN GENEVA WHICH IS GOING TO BE MANNED ROUND THE CLOCK IN AN EFFORT TO
BOOST COMMUNICATION AND CO ORDINATION AND MONITOR BETTER THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BUT IT'S STRANGE TO TALK ABOUT ASSOCIATION OF HOSTILITIES WHEN THE VIOLENCE IS CONTINUING IN A LEPER ICE SO I THINK
CERTAINLY THE AMERICANS THE RUSSIANS SAY IT'S VITAL TO GET SOME AGREEMENT ABOUT ALEPPO AND END THE VIOLENCE THERE INDEED JOHN KERRY THERE'S A GIVE STATE WARNED OF REPERCUSSIONS IF THIS CARRIES ON THERE'S A SUSPICION ISN'T THERE THAT ASAD WITH MOSCOW'S SUPPORT IS SIMPLY TRYING TO GET MILITARY VICTORIES WHILE CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT CEASEFIRE
YES CERTAINLY AND CERTAINLY AMONG SOME WESTERN OFFICIALS I THINK THE PERCEPTION IS THAT RUSSIA ISN'T DOING ENOUGH TO USE THE INFLUENCE IT HAS IN DAMASCUS DID TO REIN IN SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES AROUND ALEPPO OR THE MOSQUE IT DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT NOW THE RUSSIANS WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK MOSCOW SAYS IT DOES WANT PEACE AND STABILITY AND
AN INCLUSIVE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL TRANSITION BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT WHO SIDE RUSSIA IS ALL THERE IS A SIDE AT THE SEWING AUTHORITIES STEVE ROSENBERG IN MOSCOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE ROW ABOUT ANTI SENATORS AND WHICH CONTINUES TO GRIP THE LABOUR PARTY FEATURES PROMINENTLY IN MANY OF THE PAPERS
IN THE TELEGRAPH THE CHIEF RABBI F. THIS SAYS LABOUR HAS A SEVERE PROBLEM AND IT'S TIME FOR JEREMY CORBIN TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION TO DRAIN THE POISON AND STAMP OUT ANTI SEMITE ISM THE PAPER SAYS FIFTY PARTY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED IN THE FIVE DAYS SINCE MY ORGAN INSISTED THERE WAS NO PROBLEM INCREASING THE PRESSURE ON HIS LEADERSHIP RUMOURS OF A COUP AGAINST MY CORBIN ARE CONTINUING TO GROW SAYS THE TIMES UNSURPRISING ACCORDING TO THE DAILY EXPRESS
CONSIDERING WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS MISTER CORBIN'S COMPLACENT IN INEFFECTIVE HANDLING OF THE RATTLE BUT THE GUARDIAN DAMPENS DOWN SPECULATION OF A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE CLAIMING POLLSTERS HAVE WORN DISGRUNTLED LABOUR M.P.S THAT HIS SUPPORT ACROSS THE PARTY A WHOLE MAKES HIM UNTOUCHABLE
THE PAPERS AS MY CORBIN'S CRITICS NOW EXCEPT HE'D BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT EVEN IF LABOUR LOSES SEATS IN THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS ON THURSDAY PICTURES OF CHILDREN SKIPPING SCHOOL YESTERDAY IN PROTEST AT SATS TESTS FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS FEATURE IN MOST OF THE PAPERS FOR YOUNG GIRL HOLDING A PLACARD OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION STARES OUT FROM THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TIMES
LEAVE OUR KIDS ALONE IS THE HEADLINE IN THE EYE THE SUN DISAGREES IN AN EDITORIAL THE PAPER SAYS MOLLYCODDLING PARENTS ARE FAILING THEIR CHILDREN BY TAKING THEM OUT OF SCHOOL TO AVOID THE TEST SCHOOL SHOULD BE TOUGH IT'S INSISTS AND PARENTS WHO DODGED THE SAT SHOULD BE FINED AND WHILE THERE ARE STILL PAGES AND PAGES OF COVERAGE DETAILING HOW LEICESTER CITY CELEBRATED WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE FINANCIAL TIMES TAKES A DIFFERENT TACK
ACCORDING TO THE PAPER BUSINESS SCHOOLS ARE TO START STUDYING THE TEAM'S UNLIKELY RISE AS A SPORTING LESSON ON HOW TO ACHIEVE VICTORY AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS ANALYST SUGGESTIONS COULD LEARN FROM THE MANAGEMENT'S SAVVY USE OF STATISTICS IN THE TRANSFER MARKET AND THE TEAM'S RUTHLESSLY EFFICIENT APPROACH TO WINNING MATCHES
IT'S NOW TWENTY TO SEVEN NOW JUST OVER A YEAR AGO THE CONSERVATIVES PUT HOME OWNERSHIP AT THE HEART OF THEIR ELECTION MANIFESTO THE GOVERNMENT'S FLAGSHIP HOUSING AND PLANNING BILL HAD A STORMY PASSAGE THROUGH THE LORDS SO HOW DID IT DO ON ITS RETURN TO THE COMMONS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HUME FOUND OUT
THE GOVERNMENT SUFFERED THIRTEEN DEFEATS ON ITS CONTROVERSIAL HOUSING BILL IN THE LORDS AND HAD TO MAKE SEVERAL CONCESSIONS TO STAVE OFF MORE BUT NOW MINISTERS HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SAND KICKED IN THEIR FACES ANY LONGER IN THE COMMONS THE HOUSING MINISTER BRANDON LEWIS WAS DETERMINED TO PRESERVE THE GUTS OF THE BILL AND OVERTURNED SOME OF THOSE HOUSE OF LORDS DEFEAT
WE ARE DELIVERING ON THEIR PROMISES WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER ON PROMISES ON THAT CONTRACT WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY ON THAT MAN DAY THEY GAVE US A MANDATE TO DELIVER FIRST SOCIAL WITH THEIR FIRST CONSERVATIVE BUDGET IN NINETEEN YEARS AND A MANDATE TO DELIVER THIS GROUNDBREAKING BILL THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY MOVING TO GO FURTHER WITH THIS BILL TO DELIVER MORE HOMES FOR OUR COUNTRY
NOW ONE OF THE WAYS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO THIS IS BY OFFERING FIRST TIME BUYERS AND ENGLAND A TWENTY PERCENT DISCOUNT TO A NEW STARTER HOMES BUT LABOUR'S KAREN BUT WONDERED IF THAT WAS QUITE FAIR SHE'S A LONDON M.P. AND RECKONED THAT IN INNER LONDON THE SAUCER HOMES WILL INDEED COMING UP FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WE HAVE TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF PRIORITIES AND IS THE MINISTER REALLY TELL ME
I DO HOPE THAT REQUIRES AN INCOME OF SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR MORE THAN THAT OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS A GENUINELY GOOD USE OF PUBLIC PRIORITY
WELL THE LORDS HAD ALSO DEFEATED MINISTERS OVER THEIR PLANS TO OBLIGE COUNCILS TO CHARGE HIGHER RENTS TO BETTER OFF TENANTS AND SOCIAL HOUSING THE GOVERNMENT WANTS ANYONE EARNING OVER THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR OUTSIDE LONDON OR FORTY THOUSAND INSIDE THE CAPITAL TO PAY TWENTY PENCE MORE IN RENT FOR EVERY POUND THEY EARN OVER THAT THRESHOLD THE MONEY RAISED WILL GO TO THE TREASURY
BRANDON LEWIS THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FAIR WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE OVER THAT INCOME SO HE DON'T HAVE THAT HOME OR HAVE TO MOVE TO FARMING SO WE'RE SAYING THERE'S PEOPLE EARN MORE MONEY THEY PAY YOU CONTRIBUTE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH ACTUALLY IS QUITE REASONABLE
LABOUR'S LYNN BROWN DIDN'T THINK IT WAS REASONABLE AT ALL HE TALKS ABOUT JUST PAIN AN EXTRA FEW POUNDS MORE THIS IS NONSENSE WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS IS A TAX ON ASPIRATION AND THE IDEA THAT
LONDON EARNING FORTY GRAND HERE IS RICH HE'S BELOW ONLY IT REALLY DOES COST AN AWFUL LOT TO LIVE IN THIS WONDERFUL CAPITAL CITY ABOUT SOMETHING THE MINISTER IS FAILING TO
A CONSERVATIVE CHLOE SMITH COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY LABOUR M.P.S DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA CONSIDERING THAT MANY OF THOSE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THIS HOUSE OFTEN ARGUE THAT THE RICH SHOULD PAY MORE IT'S RATHER PUZZLING BUT IN THIS CASE THIS INTERPOSE
BUT SPEAKING FOR LABOUR ROBERTA BLACKMAN WOOD SAID SHE THOUGHT THE WHOLE BILL WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND EXTREME AND WHAT WAS SOCIAL HOUSING FOR IT IS THERE TO MEET MADE AND THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TOUCHING TALENTS IN THIS WAY
WHY IT'S CLAIMING TO STAND UP FOR A HARD WORKING PEOPLE IS EYE RELIGIOUS BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE IN LONDON WHO WERE HOMELESS ARGUED THE CONSERVATIVE BOB BLACKMAN
AND ACTUALLY THERE'S A HUGE QUEUE OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR A SOCIALLY RENTED PROPERTY BUT IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ON RELATIVELY HIGH SALARIES TO OCCUPY SOCIALLY RENTED PROPERTIES WHEN THEY'RE SUCH A HUGE QUEUE I'M SUCH A HUGE STEP
BUT LABOUR'S DAVID LARRY RECKONED THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES DID NOTHING TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE AND HE POINTED TO THE MOVE TO FORCE COUNCILS TO SELL OFF THEIR MORE VALUABLE PROPERTY TO FUND THEIR RIGHT TO BUY SCHEME FOR A HOUSING ASSOCIATION TENANTS HE WAS BAFFLED
THESE COUNCIL HOMES SHOULD BE GOING
ON THE CAPITAL'S WAITING THIS BUT INSTEAD THEY'VE BEEN SOLD TO PRIVATE BUYERS FOR WHAT REASON I ASK THE MINISTER TO FUND
OF YET MORE COUNCIL PROPERTIES TO TENANTS A DISCOUNT RATE UNDER RIGHT TO BUY IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT I'M PUTTING ON MY
CONSERVATIVE HAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY I'M STRUGGLING
HE WAS WAVING HIS ARMS ABOUT AND GETTING QUITE ANIMATED BUT PASSION DOESN'T HAVE THE FINAL SAY BECAUSE UNLIKE IN THE LORDS THE GOVERNMENT HAS A COMFORTABLE MAJORITY IN THE COMMONS SILVER'S HOUSE OF LORDS DEFEATS WHERE EASILY OVERTURNED
IT'S NOT QUITE THE END OF THE STORY THE HOUSING AND PLANNING BILL NOW RETURNS TO THE LORD SO I HOPE YOU'RE KEEPING UP HERE WHERE PIERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO HOLD OUT OR BACK DOWN AND LET THE ELECTED COMMONS FINALLY HABITS AWAY SUSAN HUMOUR REPORTING YOU CAN HAS EVER HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT TO TOP ESTATE ON LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THE NEWS THAT THE U.S. SENATOR TED CRUISE HAS ENDED HIS ATTEMPT TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CLEARING THE WAY FOR THE BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP TO BECOME THE PARTY'S NOMINEE
IT IS A QUARTER TO SEVEN IF THE POLLSTERS ARE RIGHT TOMORROW SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS WILL SEE THE S.N.P. TIGHTEN THEIR GRIP ON POWER AT HOLYROOD SCOTTISH LABOUR THE ONCE DOMINANT PARTY HOPE AT LEAST TO PUT A STOP TO THEIR DRAMATIC DECLINE IN SUPPORT WHILST THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN PRESSING TO OVERTAKE LABOUR AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION SAYING THEY ARE BEST PLACED TO HOLD THE NATIONALISTS TO ACCOUNT
SO WHAT WOULD ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF S.N.P. DOMINANCE MEAN FOR SCOTLAND JIM JIM KNOCKED YOUR REPORTS FROM THE CONSTITUENCY OF ALMOND VALLEY
SATURDAY IN LIVINGSTON WEST OF EDINBURGH AND THE S. AND P. ON THE STREET
APPARENTLY IN COMMAND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IN SCOTLAND ARE FIGHTING THIS CAMPAIGN ON AN UNSPOKEN JOINT SLOGAN HELP US PRODUCE A BETTER OPPOSITION
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRAPPED THE STREETS OF THIS CONSTITUENCY ALMOND VALLEY OR ALMOST ANY OTHER FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU'LL FIND ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT NICOLA STURGEON AND HER PARTY WILL LOSE POWER ON FIRST
IT'S GOT SKIN STUFF THAT'S GOING TO GO
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS VERY INHOSPITABLE TERRITORY FOR CONSERVATIVES WHERE OUTSIDE THE BIG SHOPPING CENTRE THAT DOMINATES THE NEW TOWN OF LIVINGSTON BUT ACROSS SCOTLAND THERE CAMPAIGN HAS HAD A BIT OF PEPPER
THE ODD THING IS THAT LABOUR DOMINANT FOR SO LONG HERE WITHIN THE SEAT ONCE HELD AT WESTMINSTER BY ROBIN COOK AND ALMOST PLAYING THE SAME GAME
MORNING MISS MARSHALL FROM THE LABOUR PARTY NOT THE DOORS FOR FUN LIKE LOCAL BOY ONES IN A FEW LABOUR ON ELECTION DAY AND A TAIL
TO SINK SIR I KNOW IT'S A SECURE SOME POSTERS EVEN THINK THAT IT MAY BE A CLOSE RUN THING FOR SECOND PLACE WITH THE TORIES SOMETHING UNTHINKABLE NOT SO LONG AGO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT DEMOCRACY
WHAT WHO'S FOR NEIL FRIENDLY AN M.S.P. IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT FROM THE LEFT WHO RAN FOR THE SCOTTISH LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR ON A CORBIN TICKET
ACKNOWLEDGES HOW HARD LABOUR IS NOW HAVING TO FIGHT AND FROM HIM YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE I'M THIRSTY
NE E. E. WAY IN WHICH WE SEE SEE EMBASSIES AND DISSENSION MACON CENTRALISED THE WAY IN WHICH WE SEE CERTAIN PEOPLE POO AND TO PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS WE WILL TALK IN POTENTIALLY ABOUT OR GOVERNMENT REFORM SCHOOLS BEING TAKEN OUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL
DECISIONS OVER X. Y. AND Z. NO BEEN IN THE HANDS OF MINISTERS AND NORMAL AND THE HANDS OFF WORK OR POLITICIANS WE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT YOU USES YOUR GRANTS TO EXTEND THAT SPARROW AND TENTACLES AND DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS
THESE ARE NOT GOOD FOR OUR DEMOCRACY
THAT CATCHES THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THIS CAMPAIGN IT HASN'T BEEN PRINCIPALLY ABOUT INDEPENDENCE BUT IT IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SCOTLAND WILL BE IN PLACE IF THE S.N.P. DO WIN A MAJORITY AND BY TWENTY TWENTY COMPLETE THIRTEEN YEARS IN POWER
ANGELA CONSTANCE CABINET SECRETARY FOR EDUCATION IS THE CANDIDATE HERE IN AMMAN VALLEY OUT AND ABOUT TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE SHOPPING CENTRE ON SATURDAY MORNING
ONE THING ABOUT THE S.N.P. ISRAEL AS DIFFERENT AND A GOOD OFFICE AS WE ALWAYS HAVE AN EYE TO THE FUTURE
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTIES WHO WILL SOMETIMES SAY OFTEN WHISPERING BEHIND THEIR HANDS WERE HEADING TOWARDS A ONE PARTY STATE
WHY DIDN'T HE AT LEAST PEOPLE COMPLAIN FOR SCOTT WENT HAD OVER FIFTY WE'VE GOT A PEAS LISTEN AND SCOTT WENT I'D OPEN DEMOCRATIC MODERN COUNTRY
THERE WERE ACTIONS TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ARE A PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION SYSTEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WE SURPASSED ALL EXPECTATIONS BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU COULD BE IN A STRONG POSITION THEY HAVE YOUR CHICKEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO FRENCH RANTED
IT SUITS THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON TO APPEAL TO HER CALL SUPPORT BY WARNING THAT A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER BUT THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE HERE STEPHANIE SMITH ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT MANY VOTERS HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO SECOND REFERENDUM THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO CONCENTRATE ON THINGS LIKE EDUCATION SYSTEM OR N.H.S. AND MAKING SURE THAT ARE COUNTRIES GOVERN PROPERLY WE DON'T WANT A SECOND REFERENDUM
YOU KNOW WE'RE OFFERING SOMETHING THAT NONE OF THE OTHER PARTIES CAN OFFER AND THAT IS A STRONG OPPOSITION THE S.N.P. HAVE HAD AT THEIR OWN WEE FOR FOR NINE YEARS NOW AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A STRONG OPPOSITION THERE TO FOCUS THEIR MINDS ON GOVERNING A COUNTRY
AND NICOLA STURGEON MUST REASSURE HER TROOPS THAT SHE DOES THINK INDEPENDENCE WILL COME
OTHER PATIENTS HAS BECOME ONE OF HER FAVOURITE WORDS AND SPEECHES AND RECENT TIMES BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ABOUT
GOOD GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAXES GO UP FOR BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES LABOUR WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN THE S. AND P. AND THAT RESPECT AND IS THE S.N.P. APPARENTLY SUPPORTED BY HALF THE ELECTORATE AS COMPETENT AND ADMINISTRATION AS IT CLAIMS TO BE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IN THE SEAT AS CHARLES DUNDAS
I THINK THE S.N.P. IS MANIFEST STORE FOR ALL THE RHETORIC THAT IT CONTAINS IS VERY CONSERVATIVE WITH A SMALL C. THEY DON'T WANT TO ROCK THE BOAT THEY'RE VERY CAUTIOUS I THINK TAXES ARE VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW LITTLE THEY WANT TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THIS
THEM FANDANGO OF THE ELECTION OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND THEY HAD THE CHANCE FOR SCOTLAND TO BE DIFFERENT YES N. P. OF ESSENTIALLY GIVEN AS A MANIFESTO OF BUSINESS AS USUAL AND I THINK THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE THE HEIRESS TO THAT AMBITION AND CHANGE THAT THE REFERENDUM GAVE US THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT HAS MANY MORE POWERS THAN BEFORE THAT OUR FRIEND END NOTABLY MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAISING REVENUE
THE BIG QUESTION WHICH WILL ONLY BE SETTLED IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT IS HOW SCOTLAND ADAPTS TO MUCH MORE POWERFUL DEVOLUTION WITH ONE DOMINANT PARTY
WHICH FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN ABLE TO GOVERN PRETTY WELL AS IT
JIM KNOCKED YOU THERE OF COURSE IT'S EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN IN THE RUN UP TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM WILL BE HEADING TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U.K. AND INDEED THE WORLD TO LOOK AT WHAT BRICKS IT MIGHT MEAN THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WILL BE HEARING FROM GERMANY OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICES THERE NOW OUTSIDE THE MAIN STATION IN HANOVER GOOD MORNING MATTHEW
MORNING SARAH IT'S THE ASPARAGUS SEASON HERE IN THERE ARE FRESH GIANT WHITE ASPARAGUS ON SALE JUST OUTSIDE THE STATION AS THE TRAMS PULLIN AND WORKERS HEAD FOR THE PLATFORMS ASPARAGUS IS A GERMAN TRADITION AND THERE ARE SOME IN THIS COUNTRY WHO FEEL THAT THEIR TRADITIONS ARE NOW UNDER THREAT
BECAUSE OF NEWCOMERS THERE ARE NEW FIGURES OUT YESTERDAY SHOWING THAT THIS IS MORE AND MORE SO A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS THERE ARE TEN POINT NINE MILLION IN GERMANY IT'S ABOUT THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IT'S SIMILAR TO THE U.K. AND LAST YEAR OF COURSE WE KNOW THEY ADDED ANOTHER MILLION THAT INFLUX HAS LED TO THE GROWING POPULARITY OF A FAIRLY NEW GERMAN POLITICAL PARTY THE ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND IT STARTED AS AN ANTI EURO THE CURRENCY MOVEMENT THEN MORPHED INTO AN N.T. Y. U. MOVEMENT
BUT NOW IT'S GRABBING THE HEADLINES FOR EXPRESSING HIS CONCERNS ABOUT MIGRATION THEN SPECIFICALLY THIS LINE FROM ITS MANIFESTO PUBLISHED LAST WEEK ISLAM IS NOT A PART OF GERMANY I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE REGIONAL LEADERS WHO SITS ON ITS POLICY BUREAU PAUL ABOUT WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT
ACTUALLY WE HAVE REALISED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MUSLIM WORLD THE EUROPEAN WORLD HAD IS THE JOB IN THE WORLD WE HAVE SEPARATED THE WRITTEN LAW
THE LAWS OF THE CHURCH AND THEY'D SAY THE RELIGION HAS BECOME QUITE A PRIVATE THING SO IF IT'S ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE OF RELIGION AND STATE THAT'S ONE THING BUT IT IS QUITE A BOLD STATEMENT TO SAY THAT ISLAM DOESN'T BELONG IN GERMANY HAS A CONSTITUTION THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO WORSHIP IN WHICHEVER WAY THEY WISH IN GERMANY THAT'S CORRECT BUT THERE'D SOMETHING WHAT WE RECOGNISED IS A PROBLEM
FOR A MUSLIM LIVING IN GERMANY BECAUSE HE HAS TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE CROWN BUT ACTUALLY HE LIVES IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE EXPECT THAT HE FOLLOWS THEIR CONSTITUTION IN THE LAW YOU HAVE HAD MUSLIMS LIVING IN GERMANY FOR MANY YEARS
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD NO LONGER LIVE HERE YOU HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE MUSLIM MEMBERS OF THE BANDAR STARKER PARLIAMENT ABSOLUTELY KNOW EVERYBODY AND YOU ARE RIGHT IT IS PART OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES DODGER WON'T GIVE CADETS THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE IN WHATEVER YOU WANTED YOU CAN FOLLOW AND YOU COULD PRACTISE YOUR RELIGION BUT IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE A.F. DEEP REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE BOARD OF ED WE DEPUTIES OF JEWS HAS SAID THIS IS XENOPHOBIC MUSLIM LEADERS WHO SAY THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE RISE OF HITLER
YES BUT BUT ONE SHOULDN'T ALWAYS COMPARE THIS ONE IT'S POSSIBLE LIST WITH NED NO
SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES IN ISLAM IT IS LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD AND KEN PRACTISE HIS RELIGION AND OF COURSE BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE ISLAMIC STATES AND THE LAST YEAR IS MORE AND MORE
AND YOU THINK THIS IS A VOTE WINNER YOU'RE GAINING IN POPULARITY YOU'RE GOING UP IN THE POLLS I DON'T THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO CALCULATE WHO'S VOTING FOR HER AND WHY WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CONCERNS OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY SERIOUS AND IT IS VISIBLE
THAT WEIGHS MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MAYBE FOUR FIVE MILLION MIGRANTS WE ARE NOT ABLE FINANCIALLY WE ARE NOT ABLE MEN DILLY AND NOD ABLE MAYBE CULTURALLY
TO INTEGRATE SUCH A BIG NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
YOUR PARTY STARTED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE ONE OF THE EARLY MEMBERS AS A PARTY PRIMARILY DIRECTED AGAINST GERMAN MEMBERSHIP OF THE EURO OF THE EUROZONE AND THEN IT MORPHED INTO A PARTY THAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION OR A BIGGER LEVEL
NOW IT'S TAKING ON MUCH MORE OF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STATUS OF REFUGEES IN THIS COUNTRY AND ISLAM
ARE THEIR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THOSE THREE SUBJECTS WHERE ARE QUITE SIMPLE
THESE ARE THE MAJOR CONCERNED PEOPLE HAVE MY COUNTRY AND THEN WE CARE FOR THEIR CONCERNS WHEN HE WAS A EURO AFTER TO SOLVE AND SEVERAL AID WE THINK ABOUT IS THE EURO CURRENCY WAS TO KEEP IT OR NOT
IF ITS CRITICISM OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHERE THEY GET THAT MORE AND MORE POWER IN AN ELECTED COMMISSIONS WE THINK ABOUT IT AND NOW THE GERMANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY WHEN WE GET SOME ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OR LESS PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES
THIS IS A JOB TO DO SO YOUR PARTY POLICY IS LED BY THE FEARS AND THE CONCERNS OF A PROPORTION OF THE GERMAN POP IF I DISAGREE WHAT MEANS THE FURIES THE CONCERNS PEOPLE
AND A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU PICK UP ON OUR CONCERNS THAT ARE PLAYING OUT IN BRITAIN AT THE MOMENT WITH A WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IF BRITAIN WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE IS THAT A PATH WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE GERMANY FOLLOW I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN U.K. AND GERMANY THE BRITISH CONCERNS WE PRE FUR
THEY'D SAY THE OLD STRUCTURE OF THE EUROPEAN I WILL BE EACH OF HER CHOPS COMMANDER OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY EXON OR ACADEMY GAY UNION THAT'S FINE I THINK THAT WE DO NOT NEED AND WE DON'T WANT
EUROPEAN STATE THE UNITED STATES OF EUROPE

IT'S BEEN A BRUTAL BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT WITH A LOT OF HARSH WORDS TRADED NOW MISTER TRUMP MUST BUILD BRIDGES AND TRIED TO UNITE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEHIND HIM THAT WILL BE NO EASY TASK BUT IN HIS VICTORY SPEECH HE WAS THROWING OUT OLIVE BRANCHES WHERE ONCE HE WAS THROWING PUNCHES TO THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP TO HIS RIVALS TO HISPANICS TO WOMEN
AND ALTHOUGH HILLARY CLINTON LOST IN INDIANA SHE STILL SEEMS THE OVERWHELMING FAVOURITE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION A NUMBER OF POLES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT IN A STREET FIGHT WITH HIM SHE'D WIN EASILY BUT AS THE LAST TEN MONTHS HAVE SHOWN THERE ARE NO CERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY IN A TWO HORSE RACE
DAVID CAMERON IS BEING URGED TO ALLOW MORE SYRIAN CHILD REFUGEES TO COME TO THE U.K. A PERSONAL APPEAL HAS BEEN MADE BY SIR ERIC REICH WHO ARRIVED IN BRITAIN IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AT THE AGE OF FOUR AS PART OF THE KINDER TRANSPORT SCHEME WHICH HELP TO TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN ERIC WHO CHAIRS THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH REFUGEES SAYS THE U.K. SHOULD OPEN IT SHORES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS OF SYRIA'S WORE OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS

MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS SOUTHERN HEALTH IS INVESTIGATING AN ABUSIVE PHONE MESSAGE LEFT FOR A MOTHER WHOSE SON DIED WHILST IN THE TROUT THE TRUST'S CARE THE CALLER CAME TO WORK AT THE TRUST SOUTHERN HEALTH EMPLOYS MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE ACROSS FOUR COUNTIES FROM BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TO DORSET AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BUCHANAN REPORTS

PIERS SAY NEGOTIATING BRITAIN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE E.U. SHOULD VOTERS CHOOSE TO LEAVE FOR NEXT MONTH'S REFERENDUM WOULD BE COMPLEX AND DAUNTING THE WARNING COMES FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS EUROPEAN UNION COMMITTEE WHICH SAYS THE PROCESS COULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS THE VOTES LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAYS THE REPORT MAKES CLEAR JUST HOW MUCH CONTROL BRUSSELS HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT THEN RIGHT
A VOTE TO LEAVE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD WOULD NOT MEAN AN IMMEDIATE EXIT FROM THE E.U. THERE IS A TWO YEAR WINDOW OF NEGOTIATION ALLOWED UNDER E.U. RULES WHICH COULD BE EXTENDED ONLY IF ALL MEMBER STATES AGREE ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE OF PIERS WHICH TOOK EVIDENCE FROM TWO E.U. LAW EXPERTS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX PART OF THE NEGOTIATION WOULD BE ESTABLISHING THE RIGHTS OF U.K. CITIZENS ALREADY LIVING IN OTHER MEMBER STATES TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SCHOOLING AND EMPLOYMENT
WHILE THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT RECOMMEND WHETHER THE U.K. SHOULD REMAIN IN THE E.U. OR LEAVE IT CONCLUDES A NEW DEAL WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO REACH EMPHASISING THAT TRADE DEALS BETWEEN THE E.U. AND NON E.U. STATES HAVE TAKEN BETWEEN FOUR AND NINE YEARS ON AVERAGE VOTE LEAVE ARGUES A U.K. E.U. TREATY SHOULD BE WRAPPED UP IN TWO YEARS
PLANS TO MAKE ADVERTS FOR BROADBAND SERVICES LESS CONFUSING HAVE BEEN DELAYED BY FIVE MONTHS THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY HAD ORIGINALLY SAID IT WOULD BRING IN NEW RULES BY THE END OF MAY BUT IT NOW SAYS PROVIDERS WILL HAVE UNTIL THE END OF OCTOBER TO PREPARE FOR THE CHANGES HERE'S OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT ROY CATON JONES
SHOP AROUND FOR A NEW BROADBAND DEAL AND YOU'LL USUALLY FIND THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE MONTHLY PAYMENT FOR LINE RENTAL AND THERE MAY BE OTHER HIDDEN COSTS RESEARCH FOR THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY FOUND THIS WAS CONFUSING WHEN FIRST SHOWN AN ADVERT EIGHTY ONE PER CENT OF CONSUMERS WERE UNABLE TO CALCULATE CORRECTLY THE TOTAL COST OF A CONTRACT
FROM OCTOBER NEW RULES WILL MEAN COMPANIES HAVE TO SHOW ALL THE COSTS WITHOUT SEPARATING OUT LINE RENTAL THEY'LL ALSO HAVE TO MAKE IT FAR CLEARER HOW LONG SPECIAL OFFERS LAST AND WHAT UPFRONT COSTS CONSUMERS WILL PAY ONE SUPPLIER TALKTALK HAS ALREADY SAID IT WILL SCRAP SEPARATE LINE RENTAL PAYMENTS OTHERS SEEM LIKELY TO FOLLOW
THE SKETCH BOOK CONTAINING THE EARLIEST KNOWN WORKS OF THE BRITISH ARTIST STANLEY SPENCER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AT HIS DAUGHTER'S HOME IN LONDON THE BOOK DATES FROM NINETEEN OH SEVEN WHEN HE WAS FIFTEEN IT CONTAINS DRAWINGS OF MERMAIDS SOLDIERS RIDING GIANT SNAILS AND VIEWS OF CROOKHAM IN BERKSHIRE WHERE HE WAS BORN AND SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE THANK YOU DIANA IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN
IT'S OVER THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO STOP HIM HE'S FINALLY SEEN OFF ALL THOSE WHO BEGAN BY DISMISSING HIM AS A JOKE AND ENDED BY LABELLING LABELLING HIM AS A TOTALLY AMORAL A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR AND A SERIAL PHILANDERER
THOSE WERE THE WORDS USED TO DESCRIBE DONALD TRUMP BUT THE LAST MAN TO STAND BETWEEN HIM AND HER BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TED CRUISE OF COURSE BUT JUST A FEW HOURS AGO THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA FORCED CRUISED TO ACCEPT THAT HE THAT THEY HAD LOST OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT WATCH THE RESULT COME IN A TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK
MY DAY
LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY HE WAS WRITTEN OFF AS A GIANT EGO WITH A MINISCULE
BUT HIS VICTORY IN INDIANA HAS DELIVERED THE KNOCKOUT BLOW ITS FORCES ONLY SERIOUS RIVAL CREWS FOR THE RACE IT'S MADE IN THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE AND HE CELEBRATED AT TRUMP TOWER BUT NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER WHERE HE SEALED SO MANY DEAL NEVER HAD BEEN THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH OR A BEAUTIFUL THING TO BE
WAS STOPPED UP FORCES ARE PIN SO MANY HOPES ON INDIANA BUT IN THIS DO OR DIE CONTEST TAKE CREWS SUFFER THE PERSONALLY CRUSHING DEFEAT AND DECIDED TO END HIS
WE GAVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT BUT THE VOTERS CHOSE ANOTHER PATH AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART
WE ARE SUSPENDING A CAMPAIGN THE REPUBLIC OF RACE GOT VICIOUSLY UGLY OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT TRUMP SALUTED CRUISERS ONE HELL OF A COMPETITOR WHAT TED DID IS IT REALLY A VERY BRAVE THING TO DO AND A GREAT THING TO DO
THE CUP THAT APPEAR TONIGHT WAS MORE SOMBRE BOUGHT PRESIDENTIAL HE DITCH THE ROLLICKING RHETORICAL STYLE THAT'S PROPELLED HIS CAMPAIGN HE'S ALREADY TURNING HIS ATTENTION TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON SHE WON'T THAT BE A GREAT PRESIDENT YOU WILL NOW BE A GOOD PRESIDENT YOU WILL BE A POOR PLACE
AS THE MUSIC CRESCENDO AT THE END OF HIS VICTORY RALLY IT'S WORTH DWELLING ON WHAT HE'S ALREADY ACHIEVED HE'S JUST PULLED OFF ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY FEATS IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY
THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN
BRYANT REPORTING ALL THAT NOW BLOCKS TRUMP FROM THE OVAL OFFICE IS HILLARY CLINTON AND OF COURSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY PAUL GIGO HE IS EDITOR OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S EDITORIAL PAGE AND AS IT HAPPENS TO THE CHAIR OF THE PULITZER PRIZE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO TO BE HERE
OH HE SAID IT'S OVER BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD STOP HIM BECAUSE WE KNOW THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT WILL WORK MIGHTY HARD TO FIND SOMETHING WHETHER THE DELEGATES AT THE CONVENTION AND JAWLINE CLEVELAND CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT AND SO THERE IS A SMALL SMALL CHANCE THAT THEY THEY COULD REVOLVE IF TRUMP BLOWS UP BETWEEN NOW AND THEN BUT I THINK IT'S PASSING SMART PROTRUDE OPPORTUNITY SO IN OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW ALL THAT WE ALREADY KNOW
BUT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT EMERGE THEY COULD USE IT AS AN EXCUSE YES HE'S WON SEVEN PRIMARIES NOW ROLL WITH MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE IN INDIANA HE'S NOT RHODE ISLAND IT'S NOT CONNECTICUT IT'S NOT THE LIBERAL NORTH EAST THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE HEARTLAND HE ONE DAY OR ONE ON ONE AGAINST HEAD CRUISE AND HAVING DONE THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S THE SIGNAL TO THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT BIG TRUCK AT THEIR BOAT
VOTERS WANT NOW SOME HAVE CLAIMED THE TRUMP IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE THAT IN OTHER WORDS THIS WAS AN ACT HE'S THE T.V. STAR WHO DECIDED TO PERFORM TO GET THE NOMINATION WILL SEE THIS COUPLE ARE MODERATE CENTRIST EMERGING FROM THE TRUMP CHRYSALIS DO YOU BUY THAT
I I FIND THAT A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE I THINK AND HIS CAMPAIGN DOES TOO I MEAN THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE INSIDE THE CAMPAIGNERS TRUMP CAPABLE OF CHANGING WITH A NEW ADVISER POMME ANNA FORTE OH YEAR YOU JUST SAW AN ACT BEFORE AND THE HIS EARLIER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN SAY NO TROUBLE WILL BE TRUMP I LEAN TO THE TRUMP WILL BE TRUMP CAP THE THING IS HE'S SO UNPREDICTABLE HE HAS NO FIXED PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT SO HE COULD COME OUT HILLARY CLINTON FROM ALL ANY AND ALL DIRECTIONS HE PROBABLY WILL
IS THE MISTAKE THAT OFTEN IS MADE BY THOSE OF US OBSERVING FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO FOCUS ON THE MAN NOT THE ISSUE IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S TRUMP NOT REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY AGAINST FREE TRADE AGAINST IMMIGRATION AND TO A LARGE EXTENT AGAINST THE WORLD
OH I THINK THAT'S AN OVERSTATEMENT TO SOME EXTENT I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE EGGS OF PAUL'S AN IMMIGRATION THEY DON'T SUPPORT A LOT OF WHAT TRUMP BELIEVES IT'S BEEN RELATIVELY MINOR ISSUE IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE WITH A CORE ELEMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE BUT I THINK IN A NATIONAL ELECTION I THINK IT COULD BE A LOSER TRUP A TRADE I THINK YOU'RE CLOSER TO BEING RIGHT ABOUT THERE IS A REACTION AGAINST GLOBALISATION AND THE STATE OF SEEING IT IN BOTH PARTIES BERNIE SANDERS ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
TRUMP ON THE RIGHT BUT AGAIN WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT HIT HIM IN THE ELECTION AND SOME BELIEVE THAT THOSE SLANDERS VOTERS WHO ARE ANTI GLOBALISATION WHO ARE ANTI FREE TRADE
COULD PROVIDE PICKINGS FOR DONALD TRUMP AGAIN ARE THEY KIDDING THEMSELVES I THINK THEY ARE KIDDING THEMSELVES IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING PRIMARIES THE SANDERS VOTERS SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEM SAY THEY WERE QUITE HAPPY WITH HILLARY CLINTON IF SHE GETS THE NOMINATION AND I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL BE A RELATIVELY UNITED THE QUESTION FOR CLYM EARS CAN SHE MOTIVATE AND NUFF OF THE OBAMA COALITION SHE'S NOT A GREAT CANDIDATE AND SHE HAS VERY HIGH NEGATIVES YOURSELF THAT ADVANTAGE SHE HAS A STYLE TRUMP HAS THE HIGHEST
NEGATIVES OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF POLLING NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE A BETTING MAN BUT PEOPLE HAVE JUST GOT FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE ON THE WINNER OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL HERE IN THE U.K. OF COURSE
WOULD YOU PUT MONEY AT THOSE SORT OF ODDS ARE LONG ODDS ON TRUMP BECOMING PRESIDENT NO I THINK THE BETTER ODDS THAN THAT I THINK THAT I MEAN I THINK THEY'D BE GIVEN ME THIS YEAR AND ITS UNPREDICTABILITY THAT I'D STATES IT IS VERY HARD TO PREDICT AND I'M OUT OF THE PREDICTION BUSINESS BUT IF I WOULD SAY IF YOU GAVE ME A DEAD SO HE PROBABLY HAS A TWENTY
TWENTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE PERHAPS OF WINNING THAT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE'LL SEE IF HE CAN ADD PRESIDENTIAL ENOUGH TO MAKE IT TOOK TO PERSUADE ENOUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TAKE A RISK PAUSING OVER THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THANK YOU IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR IF A TRUCE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO THE SYRIAN CITY OF ALEPPO RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI LAVROV SUGGESTED YESTERDAY THAT SYRIA'S MILITARY COULD DECLARE A UNILATERAL TRUCE THERE WITHIN HOURS
THE SITUATION THE CITY'S BEEN DESPERATE WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY KILLED IN A MATTER OF DAYS NOT LEAST IN HOSPITALS WHICH HAD BEEN TARGETED BY BOTH THE REGIME AND BY REBELS LAST NIGHT I SPOKE TO STEVEN HE BRIAN WHO IS UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR HUMANITY AND OUR OWN AFFAIRS AND EMERGENCY RELIEF AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF SOME KIND OF CALM IN THE CITY
WE ARE HOPING THAT FOR MINISTER LAVROV FROM RUSSIA WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THE NEW HALL ASSOCIATION OF HOSTILITIES WILL BE ANNOUNCED AND WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THAT TO COME THROUGH OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A FURTHER A RESUMPTION THE REVIVAL OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES DEPENDS UPON THIS BEING SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEKS
WHERE WE'VE HAD THE SECESSION OF HOSTILITIES WHILST THE DELIVERY OF ABSOLUTELY BASIC AN URGENT HUMANITARIAN NEEDS TO PEOPLE IN PURSUIT AND HARD TO REACH AREAS CANNOT BE CONDITIONAL UPON THIS OR SOCIAL HOSTILITIES AFTER ALL GETTING HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE IN NEED IS THE HUMANITARIAN LAW IT IS WHAT WE WILL DEMAND ALL THE TIME SHEET TO NEGOTIATE AND TO MAKE SURE OUR TRUCKS IN THE CONVOYS GO BUT
THERE'S NO QUESTION IF YOU HAVE A SENSATION OF HOSTILITIES YOU HAVE A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN YOU NEGOTIATE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE CHECK POINTS THEY TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE SECURE CAN BE CAN BE HONOURED AND THAT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN AND THE PLANNED EXTENSION
IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK COULD LEAD PERHAPS TO SOME DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PEACE PROCESS
LET'S BE CLEAR WITHOUT IT I CAN'T SEE HOW THE DEVELOPMENTS COULD TAKE PLACE TO LEAD TO PEACE PROCESS SOMETHING WHICH IS MORE DURABLE WHICH IS GOING TO BE OF HUGE AT LAST BENEFIT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO LONG OVER THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE STOOD IN SYRIA FOR THE MILLIONS WHO WERE IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES WHO HAD TO FLEE EITHER THE BOMBS THE FEAR OR BOMBS OR BECAUSE AFTER SO MANY YEARS THEY'VE LOST ALL HOPE AND SO WHILST WE HAVE
AS A RESULT OF PARTLY DISSERTATION HOSTAS HAS BEEN ABLE TO REACH A TOTAL OF THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION PEOPLE ALSO IN THE BESIEGED AREAS AND IN THE HARD TO REACH AREAS DISPARATE WANTED TO ACROSS THOSE TWO DEFINITIONS AND INDEED FIFTY THOUSAND ON THE CROSS LINE WE HAVE FIGHTING LINE CROSS WE'VE DONE THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE'VE GOT CONVOYS RECENTLY INTEREST ON THE FOUR TERMS AS IT'S CALLED NAMES WHICH WILL BE FAMILIAR
LISTENERS FROM MANY REPORTS THAT YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING OVER RECENT MONTHS AND YEARS AND WE'VE EVEN MANAGED TO GET INTO NORTHERN RURAL HOMES THESE OR BIG IMPROVEMENTS BUT FOR INSTANCE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A STREAMLINED PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA TO GET THE REQUESTS FOR THESE CONVOYS TO MOVE SO WE DO THEM WITH CONSENT AND IN SAFETY WE'VE ONLY HAD FOURTEEN OUT OF TWENTY THREE REQUESTS APPROVED IN APRIL AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT
I NEED TO PERSUADE THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO LET US THROUGH BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET PARTIAL APPROVALS WILL NO APPROVALS IT MEANS PLACES LIKE MY DA MAYOR THE PEOPLE THEY ARE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN DO TO SURVIVE LET ALONE BE PROTECTED AND OUR ANY TEST IS TO MEET NEEDS WE ARE TOTALLY IMPARTIAL AND MATTERS THAT WE HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH EVERYBODY IN ORDER TO GET OUR SUPPLIES THROUGH
STEPHEN O'BRIEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS DOWN NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE RESULTS ARE JUST IN FROM THE SUPERMARKET SAINSBURY'S AND TONIA CAN TELL US THE BAD NEWS FOR THEM
IT'S YES BUT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER THE MOST THAT WE CAN SAY HERE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE PRICE WILL STILL CONTINUES HER PROFITS ARE DOWN THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR SCENT BUT THIS IS FULLY RESULTS TO FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION SO WE'RE GIVING YOU UNDERLINE PRE TAX PROFITS I'LL TELL YOU WHY IN A MINUTE
IT'S BEEN PRETTY EVENTFUL OF COURSE FOR SAINSBURY'S IT'S BOUGHT THE ARGOS OWNER HOME RETAIL GROUP THAT COST AT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS HE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT PURCHASED SAINSBURY CHIEF EXECUTIVE MIGHT JOINS US DOWN THE LINE FROM THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO TELL US WHAT THE YEAR HAS BEEN LIKE WHAT DID THE RESULTS SAY AND I SAID THAT WE'VE QUOTED UNDERLINE PRE TAX PROFITS NOT PRE TAX PROFITS AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THAT
WE BEAT EXPECTATIONS AS YOU'VE ALREADY SAID AND ACTUALLY WE'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING OUR MARKET SHARE OUT OUR PEERS AND WE'VE SEEN VOLUME AND TRANSACTION GOES BUT AS YOU SAY IT'S BEEN AN EVENTFUL YEAR
WE STILL SEE A LEVEL OF PRICE INFLATION WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR CUSTOMERS PRICES ARE ACTUALLY FOUR PERCENT LOWER THEM WOULD YOU BELIEVE THEM TWO YEARS AGO AND THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT THE MARKET IS FIERCELY COMPETITIVE AND IT WILL REMAIN SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT MAKING OFFERS MORE SIMPLE AND HOW DO YOU ENGAGE WITH THE CUSTOMER AT THESE TIMES
WE HAVE TO CARRY ON DOING WHAT WE'VE DONE PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL WE WERE PLANNING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF A TOTAL OF THREE THOUSAND PRODUCTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR STORE STANDARDS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH AND WE THINK WE RUN THE BEST SHOPS IN THE INDUSTRY AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PRICING AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL MAKE A SUCCESSFUL OVER THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM AND YOUR FOCUS IS A BIT ON THIS SO CALLED CLICK AND COLLECTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO TO THE CAR PARK AND PICK UP
CLOSER IS THAT THEY'VE ORDERED FROM LARGE FRIDGES IN THE FORMER FLORIST CUSTOMERS ARE DEMANDING A VASE THAT WE SERVE THEIR NEEDS AND WE USE THE WORDS WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY WANT AND IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE CHANGING TIMES THAT CUSTOMERS HAVE MORE CHOICES THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD BEFORE
AND OF COURSE THAT'S REFLECTED IN OUR GROCERY ONLINE BUSINESS WHERE WE'RE INTRODUCING CLICKING FLECKED WE'VE LAUNCHED CLOTHING ONLINE DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR AND AROUND SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR CLOTHING ONLINE BUSINESS ARE PICKED UP FROM OUR SHOPS AND OF COURSE YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE THE ARGOS TRANSACTION WHICH IS VERY MUCH ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY WANT O.K. BUT WOULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH ARGOS AND HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE PICTURE AND WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT HOW YOU SEE THE CONSUMER GOING FORWARD
WELL THE MARKET IS CHANGING VERY RAPIDLY OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE MORE CHOICES THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD AND OF COURSE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE RETAIL SECTOR AND BY ACQUIRING ARGOS WE WILL PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO BUY
WHILE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PRODUCTS COLLECT THEM IN OUR SHOPS CLICK THEM IN TWO THOUSAND DIFFERENT OUTLETS WHETHER THAT SAGA STORES OR SAINSBURY'S STORES WITHIN FOUR HOURS AND WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY COMPELLING IN THE OVERALL SCHEME OF HOW DOES THAT COMPARE YOU TO AMAS AND WHY DOES THAT MAKE ME YOU'VE SAID THAT YOU WILL EXCEED AMAZON IN TERMS OF SALES BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU AMAS AND OF COURSE
WE THINK IT'S PRETTY COMPELLING AND ACTUALLY WOULD BE UNIQUE IN THE WORLD WHEN WE'VE ACTUALLY ROLLED OUT AND EXECUTED WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO ELIZA SAY THE ABILITY TO CLICK AND COLLECTING TWO THOUSAND LOCATIONS CONVENIENT TO YOU ON YOUR DOORSTEP OR INDEED HAVE IT DELIVERED TO HOME ACROSS A WIDE PORTFOLIO PRODUCTS WILL BE QUITE COMPELLING RIGHT B.H.S. WE KNOW WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION YOUR CLOTHES SALES HAVE GONE UP SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT THE WAY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT TO BUY WHAT THEY WERE
OR CLOTHING IS A IS A GREAT GREAT STORY FOR US WE'VE GROWN OUR BUSINESS BY ALMOST NINE PERCENT DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR BUT IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE CHANGING TIMES AND RETAIL DOES NOT STAND STILL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THE RIGHT THINGS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WE TALK ABOUT HIGH STREET STYLE AT SUPERMARKET PRICES AND THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT OUR BUSINESS IS GROWING THIS YEAR RIGHT JUST BRIEF FEW SECONDS ON CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY WE KNOW THAT THAT'S VERY MUCH IN THE FRAME AT THE MOMENT AT A TIME THAT A COMPANY IS STRUGGLING SHOULD THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE BE PAYING HIMSELF MORE
IT'S NOT UP TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN IN MY CASE MY PAY IS DETERMINED BY A REMUNERATION COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST THEY SIT INDEPENDENTLY AND OF COURSE OUR SHAREHOLDERS GOING TO GET A VOTE AND LAST TIME IN NINETY NINE
PERCENT PLUS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS VOTED IN FAVOUR OF OUR REMAINING ORATION POLICY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS YEAR WILL PAY A BONUS SPOT OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND OF OUR EMPLOYEES SO I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED OF THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE FOR US DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR MIGHT KEEP THANK YOU PLEASURE THANK YOU
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN BRITAIN'S HALLEY RESEARCH STATION IN THE ANTARCTIC IS IN DANGER OF FLOATING AWAY A CHASM HAS STARTED TO FORM ON THE ICE SHELF ON WHICH IT SITS WHICH MEANS THAT IT COULD SOON BE CAST ADRIFT IN THAT'S WHERE THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO TOW IT ONTO FIRMER ICE WHILE B.B.C.

LOVELY UPBEAT AND WE'LL PUT SOME PICTURES ONLINE OF THIS STATION THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BE MOVED THE FIRST OF ITS TYPE LIKE THAT YES AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS THESE MODULES OR LITTLE PODS ON THE ESSEX WHICH WHAT YOU CAN TOW YES HOW DO YOU TOW THEM WELL

DONALD TRUMP HAS ALL THAT SECURED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AFTER HIS DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE INDIANA PRIMARY HIS CLOSEST RIVAL TED CRUISE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD DROP OUT OF THE CONTEST SAYING THERE WAS NO VIABLE PATH TO VICTORY MY TRUMP PAID TRIBUTE TO THE TEXAS SENATOR AND URGED HIS PARTY TO UNITE BEHIND HIS CAMPAIGN
A BUSINESSMAN WHO CAME TO BRITAIN AS A CHILD AFTER ESCAPING NAZI GERMANY IS URGING DAVID CAMERON TO ACCEPT THREE THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED CHILD REFUGEES FROM SYRIA SO ERIC RIGHT WHO CHAIRS THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH REFUGEES TO THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD DO MORE TO HELP SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS OF THE WAR
THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF A CITY IN THE CANADIAN PROVINCE OF ALBERTA IS LEAVING FORT MCMURRAY BECAUSE OF A WILDFIRE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ON THE ROADS WHILST ABOUT NEARLY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE REACHED AN EVACUATION CENTRE THE FIRST SERVICE OF THE FLAMES WERE DESTROYING HOMES IN THE SOUTH OF THE CITY
RESEARCH SUGGESTS MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND CARE HOMES IN THE U.K. ARE ECONOMICALLY UNVIABLE AND FACED THE THREAT OF CLOSURE WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS A STUDY COMMISSIONED BY THE B. B. C. FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE CARE HOME IS BARELY PROFITABLE BECAUSE OF LOCAL AUTHORITY BUDGET CUTS AND THE NEW LIVING WAGE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS IT RECOGNISES THAT SOME CARE PROVIDERS ARE FINDING THEIR CURRENT MARKET CHALLENGING
ONE OF ENGLAND'S LARGEST N.H.S. MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IS INVESTIGATING AN ABUSIVE MESSAGE LEFT ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE OF A BEREAVED MOTHER SO ORION WHOSE SON DROWNED AT A UNIT RUN BY SOUTHERN HEALTH WAS SO HORRIFIED BY THE MESSAGE THE PURPORTED TO HAVE BEEN LEFT BY AN EMPLOYEE THAT SHE CALLED THE POLICE THE TRUST SAID IT WAS VERY CONCERNED
MINISTERS ARE BEING URGED TO STOP DITHERING OVER WHICH AIRPORT SHOULD BE EXPANDED IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE COMMONS TRANSPORT SELECT COMMITTEE DISMISSED THE GOVERNMENT'S EXTRA ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE ROOM THAT EITHER HEATHROW GATWICK SAYING WHICH SIMPLY CONFIRM WHAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT THE REFERENDUM ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL CHANGE THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY WHAT DOES THE PROSPECT OF A BRITISH EXIT ME AND FOR OTHER E.U. NATIONS WHEN OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE HAS BEEN GAUGING THE MOOD IN GERMANY THIS MORNING HE JOINS US NOW FROM OUTSIDE THE MAIN STATION IN HANOVER HELLO AGAIN MATTHEW
MORNING SARAH I MENTIONED THE ASPARAGUS STALL IN FRONT OF ME HERE AT THE STATION IT'S INSTEAD OF FAIRLY GOOD TRADE AND IT IS A SIGN THAT SOME GERMAN TRADITIONS DON'T CHANGE BUT THEIR FACES IN GERMANY THOSE OF PEOPLE STEPPING OFF THE TRAMS HEADING TO OFFICES AND SHOPS HERE IN THE CENTRE OF HANOVER THEY ARE CHANGING THEIR NON GERMAN BORN POPULATION IS ROUGHLY
THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL AND OF COURSE IMMIGRATION HAS BECOME A BIG TOPIC IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF ARRIVALS THOSE ARRIVALS LAST YEAR NOW GERMANY'S RESPONSE UNDER ANGELA MERKEL TO THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS HAS UNDOUBTEDLY AFFECT HER REPUTATION HERE THE REPUTATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ALSO BEEN HIT AS THE BLOCKERS STRUGGLED TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE NUMBERS COMING
THAT CRITICISM OF THE E.U. HAS OF COURSE HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR REFERENDUM DEBATE GERMANY'S IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING RIGHT TO REMAIN TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES IT'S ALSO SENT BACK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS BUT THOSE THAT CAN STAY MAY ONE DAY BECOME GERMAN AND THEREFORE E.U. CITIZENS AND IF WE STAY IN THEY'LL HAVE A RIGHT TO COME TO THE U.K. TO WORK
THE NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS STRIKES FEAR INTO THE HEARTS OF SOME HERE BUT IT MAKES OTHERS FEEL GERMANY IS DOING THE RIGHT THING AND I'VE BEEN TO A LARGE GERMAN COMPANY TO THE SOUTH OF HANOVER IT'S CALLED SARTORIUS AND THEY'VE STARTED AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMME EMPLOYING NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES THEY'RE TARGETING HIGHLY EDUCATED HIGHLY MOTIVATED HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS AND I MET THREE OF THEM ALL FROM DAMASCUS ALL FOCUSED ON BUILDING A LIFE HERE IN GERMANY
I WORK IN THE BUSINESS THIRTY DEPARTMENT THIS IS AL FACTORY SHE'S PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY THE STEREO TYPICAL SYRIAN REFUGEE AND WORKING IN I.T. DEPARTMENT
NO MIGHT YOU IMAGINE OMAR TO BUY AMONG THOSE ON AN OVERLAID LADEN BOAT CROSSING THE MED MARKETING PRODUCT MANAGER
NOW HERE'S AND MATTER MIA A MOTHER OF TWO FROM DOMESTIC
IN PHARMACY IF I STARTED TO STUDY HIM MASTER OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION MARKET
HOW IMPORTANT WAS IT FOR YOU TO GET A JOB THAT MATCHED YOUR SKILLS
IT'S REALLY VERY VERY
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE ANGELA MERKEL BELIEVES WILL BOOST GERMANY'S ECONOMY THE PEOPLE SHE SAYS THE COUNTRY NEEDS ATTENTION WELCOME THOSE WHO WIN TIME MAY IF THEY WISH BECOME GERMAN CITIZENS
THEY'RE THE NEW EUROPEANS NOW I HAVE PERMISSION UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY
ARE YOU STARTING A PROCESS TO BECOME A GERMAN CITIZEN I HAVE TO WAIT EIGHT YEARS IF I WANT TO TAKE THE BUS
I HAVE ALSO I DO A LOT AND DON'T TAKE MONEY FROM
CITY BENEFITS BENEFITS IF YOU BECAME A GERMAN CITIZEN WITH A GERMAN AND THEREFORE AN EASY PASSED
YOUR ENGLISH IS GREAT IF BRITAIN IS STILL IN THE E.U. AT THE HIPPEST HEDGE WOULD YOU THEN SAY GREAT IT'S BRITAIN THAT I WANT TO HEAD TO AS A CHILD AND I WAS
TOGETHER CHRISSIE NOVELS AND SHERLOCK HOLMES I USED TO REALLY THINKING ABOUT GOING TO LONDON BUT NO AS I CAME
THAT'S A NO THEN IT'S A MENU FOR A CONFERENCE OR SOMETHING ARROGANCE
WHAT EVASION WAS TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTEGRATING THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RECENTLY ARRIVED HERE IN GERMANY THE BOSS JOACHIM KREUZBERG WANTED TO GIVE APPRENTICESHIPS TO NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES
WE WERE HAVING A DECENT JOB IS A KEY ELEMENT OF INTEGRATION
SO IT WAS AN ACT OF CHARITY IT WASN'T AN ACT OF A BUSINESS MAN IF YOU LIKE WE HAD TO PLAY A CERTAIN SET OF CRITERIA
THESE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BRING TO THE TABLE IN REGARDS TO THEIR SKILLED SET AND THEN OF COURSE THEN TURN OUT TO BE ALSO A TROLL TREK TO SOME EXTENT TO RATHER BROADEN THE SCOPE OF OUR WORKFORCE
OF COURSE MANY OF THE REFUGEES WHO ARRIVE HERE ARE NOT SO HIGHLY QUALIFIED
REFUGEE CENTRE IN FRIEDLAND AND ALMA LUCAN FROM
BUT I THINK SO
COUPLE IN THEIR LATE FIFTIES EARLY SIXTIES HE'S A TAXI DRIVER AND I'M ONE OF THE FAMILY OMELETTES AND THEN HERE'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR GERMANY THE BARBIE IS SIXTY YEARS OLD HE HAS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE KIDNEY PROBLEMS AND HE SAYS HE HE CAN'T WORK SO HE AND HIS FAMILY WILL HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE
SENSE OF ACUTE CRISIS THAT I FELT LAST YEAR HERE IN GERMANY HAS WANED GONE FOR NOW THE CROWDS PRESSED ON TO TRAINS
LAST SEPTEMBER FRIEDLAND HOUSED THREE THOUSAND NOW IT'S THREE HUNDRED THE ROUTE THROUGH THE BALKANS HAS BEEN PLUGGED
AND FOR ENGLAND'S DIRECTOR HAMISH THE E.U. TURKISH AGREEMENT WHEREBY REFUGEES ARE SELECTED AND THEN SENT DIRECTLY TO GERMANY IS HELPING
ASKED THE ESTON MENTION WE'VE HAD THE FIRST REFUGEES COMING HERE UNDER A NEW AGREEMENT WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW IT GOES BUT IT'S DEFINITELY AN ADVANTAGE WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE THEY CAN BE PROCESSED MORE QUICKLY AND MAYBE WE CAN BEGIN TO INTEGRATE THEM MORE QUICKLY TO INTO GERMAN SOCIETY
ALL RIGHT
O.K. SHE CAN PUSH DOWN IN A PROSPEROUS SUBURB OF HANOVER A GROUP OF NEIGHBOURS MEET FOR COFFEE IN THE HOME OF IAN'S OLD WRECKED A MEMBER OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL
AND THEIR COY TONGUE ON COINS BURKE OH WELL LET'S ONCE ISH THAT IS HIM COUNTING THE NUMBER OF HOMES FOR REFUGEES IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SOME LIKE ANDREA AND MARTINA OR EVEN WORRIED THAT A FORMER INDUSTRIAL ESTATE RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR HOMES MIGHT BE USED TO HOUSE HUNDREDS MORE PLUS PLUS YOU DEPEND ON NINE ON THAT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NINE HUNDRED SINGLE MEN HAVE THEIR COME BUT WE ALL HAVE CHILDREN AND WE LET THEM OUT ON THE STREET WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD TO SAVE FOR OUR OLD AGE
I CAN'T SELL MY HOUSE NOW NO ONE WANTED TO GO ON IT'S NOT ABOUT THE NATIONALITY I'M TOLD ABOUT THE NUMBERS WE'RE REALLY AFRAID OF THEN WHICH ONE INSIDE A DUSTBIN BEFORE MERKEL DEFIES ALL THE SYRIAN SHOULD COME HERE SHE SHOULD DO HER HOMEWORK MAKE SURE THAT THE GERMAN PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED WE HAD LOTS OF WAVES OF REFUGEES PARK BUT THAT WAS DIFFERENT QUANTITIES WITH SOME DIDN'T CONSULT PARLIAMENT IT'S A DICTATORSHIP
ANGELA MERKEL'S VISION OF A EUROPE THAT HELPS THOSE IN NEED AND DIDN'T RETURN PROFITS FROM THEIR SKILLS IS IN DANGER THE EUROPEAN UNION IS DIVIDED OVER THIS CRISIS END DIMINISHED AS A RESULT END YET GERMANY'S INTERVENTION HAS MADE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE TO THE LIVES OF THOSE LIKE RYAN MATTER MIR THE CEREAL AND MOTHER OF TWO ONE APPRENTICE WHO DREAMS OF ONE DAY GOING BACK HOME
GREAT BRITAIN IS FOR ME IF I SAY I HAVE EXPERIENCE FROM HERE BACK TO MY COUNTRY SO WE CAN REBUILD IT DAY
MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING THERE IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE FALL OUT FROM THE ROW ABOUT ANTI CEMETERIES IN THE LABOUR PARTY CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE PAPERS WITH THE TIME SUGGESTING THE LABOUR ARE STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN THE CRISIS WITH NATIONAL OR LOCAL ELECTIONS JUST A DAY AWAY THE ONLY SAYS SENIOR PARTY FIGURES ARE PLANNING TO GO PUBLIC WITH THEIR CRITICISM OF JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP AS EARLY AS FRIDAY
THE LABOUR LEADER HIMSELF MOUNTS WHAT THE ARMY CALLS AN IMPASSIONED DEFENCE OF HIS LEADERSHIP IN A COMMENT PIECE FOR THE PAPER STRESSING THAT HE WAS ELECTED BY A LANDSLIDE JUST EIGHT MONTHS AGO LABOUR'S CANDIDATE FOR LONDON MAYOR DOESN'T ESCAPE SCRUTINY IN THE TIMES PATRICK KID NOTES THE UNFORTUNATE CHOICE A THEME TUNE FOR HIS FINAL SPEECH BEFORE THURSDAY'S ELECTION YOU CAN SEE WHY SIDIQUE KHAN'S TEAM MIGHT HAVE PICKED LILY ALLEN'S THE N. HE SAYS BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE CHECKED THE LYRICS
IF YOU LOOK TWICE YOU CAN SEE IT'S ALL LIES SHE SANG AS MY AUNT TOOK TO THE STAGE IF THERE ARE PEOPLE PAGED TO CHECK THINGS LIKE THAT WE'VE GOT THERE'S WIDESPREAD COVERAGE YESTERDAY'S PROTESTS AGAINST SATS TESTS FOR SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS BUT THE GUARDING CALLS INTO QUESTION THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO WERE ACTUALLY TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL A WHITE ALL SAUL'S TELLS THE PAPER AS FEW AS ONE THOUSAND TOOK PART
THE SCHOOLS MINISTER NICK GIBB IS MOCKED WIDELY FOR FAILING TO ANSWER A GRAMMAR QUESTION FROM HER SATS TEST SEPARATE BY MARTHA HERE ON RADIO FOUR IN THE WORLD AT ONE MUST TRY HARDER IS THE HEADLINE IN THE TIMES THE DAILY TELEGRAPH TAKES PITY ON HIM THOUGH SUGGESTING IN ITS EDITORIAL THAT THE WALKOUT MALLS REGRETTABLE AND SHOULD BE PROUD OF THE RIGOUROUS TESTING REGIME
FANS TRAVELLING TO THIS YEAR'S EUROVISION SONG CONTEST IN STOCKHOLM HAVE BEEN WARNED THEY RISK BEING THROWN OUT OF THE AUDITORIUM IF THEY SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE U.K.'S ENTRY BY WAVING THE WELSH FLAG THE DAILY MAIL SAYS FANS OF JOE WALFORD WHO'S FROM DENBIGHSHIRE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE WELSH DRAGON APPEARS ON AN OFFICIAL LIST OF BANNED FLAGS ALONGSIDE THE BANNER OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE YOUR REVISION SAY ONLY THE FLAGS OF U.N. STATES IN THEIR COUNTRIES TAKING PART WILL BE FLOWN I'VE GOTCHA I CAN SEE THAT BAD SURVIVING
A BIT NIGHTS ARE PROPAGATED DOESN'T IT PLENTY FOR GRAHAM NORTON TO TALK ABOUT ON THE NIGHT IT IS NOW A SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT VERY FEW WOMEN MAKE FILMS AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE JUST OVER ONE IN TEN U.K. FILMS WAS DIRECTED BY A WOMAN BUT DESPITE ALL THE HAND WRINGING IN THE DECADE SINCE HARDLY ANYTHING HAS CHANGED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE NUMBER OF FILMS MADE BY WOMEN HAS RISEN BY NOUGHT POINT SIX PER CENT
WILL BE JOINED BY ONE OF THOSE WHO HAS MADE IT AND MADE IT BIG TIME SUSANNA WHITE WON A BAFTA FOR DIRECT IN BLEAK HOUSE ON TELEVISION WAS NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY FOR HER JANE EYRE THEN WENT ON TO DIRECT FILMS INCLUDING NANNY MCPHEE AND THE BIG BANG AND COMING OUT NEXT WEEK HER VERSION OF LE CARRIES OUR KIND OF TRAITOR AND SHE'S HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THIS IS QUITE THIS IS A STUDY FROM DIRECTORS YOU CAME WHAT'S QUITE STRIKING ABOUT IT IS IT SHOWS EFFECTIVELY THE NON PROGRESSION OF WOMEN THROUGH THE CAREER PATH OF BEING A DIRECTOR
WELL WE KNEW THE FIGURES WERE ABOUT BUT WE SET OUT TO LOOK AT EXACTLY WHY IT WAS HAPPENING AND LOOK AT HOW YOU GET TO BE A DIRECTOR AND HOW YOU PROGRESS ONCE YOU BECOME A DIRECTOR AND WHAT'S SO SHOCKING COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WHERE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT WOMEN I DON'T KNOW ENTRY LEVEL WE WE LOOK WE SEE FIFTY PERCENT OF GRADUATES OF THE FILM SCHOOL ARE WOMEN SO IT'S A FIFTY FIFTY SPLIT FROM THE FILM SCHOOLS IN
VOCATIONAL TERMS PEOPLE COMING IN LIKE RUNNERS OR PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS ARE WOMEN BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A FUNNEL EFFECT SO AS YOU TRY TO PROGRESS UP THE CAREER LADDER AT EVERY STAGE YOU DROP OFF IF YOU'RE A WOMAN SO TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT GET TO MAKE SHORT FILMS AND THEN BY THE TIME YOU GET TO MAKE YOUR FIRST LOW BUDGET FEATURE IT DROPS DOWN TO SIXTEEN PERCENT OH KAY AND FROM BUT FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT AND YOU HAVE MADE IT TO PICK TIME HERE YOU ARE NOW DIRECTING SPY THRILLERS
WELL WHAT WITH THE POINTS AT WHICH YOU THOUGHT HOLD ON A SECOND IS THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH OR IS IT BECAUSE I'M NOT A MAN IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL I MEAN MY CAREER IS VERY TYPICAL OF WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWS IN THAT I WENT TO I DON'T FEEL BRIGHT SCHOLARSHIP TO THE INVESTOR CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES FILM SCHOOL IN THE EIGHTIES AND IT TOOK ME TILL I WAS IN MY LATE FORTIES TO GET TO MAKE MY FIRST FEATURE FILM
DESPITE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS IN TELEVISION AS HE KINDLY DESCRIBED I THINK THERE'S A SUBCONSCIOUS BIAS GOING ON NOBODY YOU START TO FEEL EXACTLY THAT SAYING YOU THINK WELL MAYBE I'M JUST NOT VERY GOOD BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER INCREDIBLY TALENTED WOMEN AROUND YOU OBSERVE A PATTERN AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS STUDY SO SHOCKINGLY SHOWS IS THAT IF YOU'RE A MAN YOU'RE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MAKE
AND IF YOU'RE A WOMAN AND ALSO THE TYPE OF FILMS WHO WERE OFFERED I MEAN NEW DID NANNY MCPHEE AND THE BIG WHICH ISN'T IT I MEAN IT'S A BIG WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BIG MOVIE HERE THE SEQUEL BUT I THINK YOU MADE THE POINT THAT IT WAS YOU WERE WHAT YOU WERE BEING OFFERED WAS A CHILDREN'S MAYBE I MEAN IT WAS GREAT FOR ME FOR MY FIRST MAYBE TO MAKE A BIG STUDIO MULTI MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE BUT I THINK THAT IS VERY TYPICAL THAT THERE IS A HUGE JEN DEVICE THAT WOMEN TEND TO BE OFFERED CHILDREN'S FILMS FAMILY FILMS
AND FOR THE SPY THRILLER I'VE JUST MADE I THINK IT'S THREE PER CENT OF PEOPLE DIRECTING THOSE ARE WOMEN AND HIGH BUDGET AND AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THREE POINT SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE DIRECTING HIGH BUDGET MOVIES ARE WOMEN WHICH IS LUDICROUS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN O.K. SO WHAT IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THESE SORT OF THINGS FOR US FOR SUCH A LONG TIME
SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT PUBLICLY FUNDED FILMS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE CAN CONTROL HAVE A TARGET OF FIFTY PERCENT SPLIT BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN BY TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE WORK SEEN WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEY DID IT IN SWEDEN THEY SET OUT TO ACHIEVE IT WITHIN FIVE YEARS IN FACT ACHIEVED IT WITHIN TWO YEARS
BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS HE'S A HUGE TALENT POOL THERE'S LOADS OF REALLY TALENTED WOMEN WAITING THAT IF YOU JUST TURN THE TAP ON THERE IS THERE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY LOOK THERE'S JUST YOU YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WHO AS THEY GET OLDER MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CHILDREN ARE NEVER GOING TO DROP OUT NOT WANT TO DO THIS AND THAT I HAD SUCH AS SAD ARGUMENT TO ME BECAUSE WE SEE WOMEN REALLY WANT TO GO INDIA IN THE DEPARTMENTS LIKE HAIR OR MAKE UP OR COSTUME THOSE WOMEN ARE TOTALLY DOMINATING THE DEPARTMENT'S BECAUSE THEIR DEPARTMENT WHERE WOMEN ARE ENCOURAGED
SO REALLY HAVING CHILDREN ISN'T THE ISSUE THE ISSUE IS WOMEN NOT BEING GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK CULTURALLY WERE FAR WORSE OFF FOR IT BECAUSE WE'RE TURNING DOWN A LOT OF VERY TALENTED PEOPLE AND JUST BRIEFLY NOW GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE DONE ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE ANYTHING
I HOPE SO BUT I KNOW I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES HE'S GOT THROUGH BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN ME OPPORTUNITIES I WAS GIVEN AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECT GENERATION KILLED BY DAVID SIMON WHICH HAD ACTION AND C.G.I. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED WE NEED WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO WORK THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER SO I THINK I THINK IT CAN IMPROVE SUSANNA WHITE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME NOW IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR GILES FRASER PRIEST IN CHARGE OF SUPER MARE NEWINGTON MORNING MORNING
AS THE SUN GOES DOWN OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN THIS EVENING YOM HER SHOW HER BEGINS IT'S WHAT WE CALL HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY BUT IN ISRAEL
AND TOMORROW MY MOTHER IN LAW WILL CONTINUE HER FAMILY TRADITION AND DRIVE UP THE HILL FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM TO VISIT THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL CENTRE
SHE WILL READ OUT THE NAMES OF HER GRANDPARENTS ROSA AND BORIS SHOWN BROWNE AND EIGHT OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS FROM POLAND WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE NAZIS
THE SHAME IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE THAT AMONGST OTHER THINGS BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPILING A DATABASE OF ALL THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WERE MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST
WE ARE OF COURSE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE NUMBER SIX MILLION BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE COLLECTIVE SIX MILLION BUT RATHER SIX MILLION INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR OWN NAMES AND FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUAL STORIES
THE PHRASE IS TAKEN FROM THE BOOK OF ISAIAH CHAPTER FIFTY SIX AND THE CONTEXT IS ACTUALLY A DISCUSSION ABOUT EUNUCHS BEFORE ISAIAH SOME BIBLICAL WRITERS HAD ARGUED THAT EUNUCHS WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE PLACE WHERE GOD WAS WORSHIPPED PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE PRIORITY THEY ATTACHED TO HAVING CHILDREN BUT ISAIAH INSIST THAT THIS GETS THINGS ALL WRONG THERE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS NOT BREEDING POTENTIAL BUT ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR
TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT'S RIGHT IN GOD'S EYES ARGUES ISAIAH TO THEM I WILL GIVE WITHIN MY TEMPLE AND ITS WALLS A MEMORIAL AND A NAME THAT IS BETTER THAN SONS AND DAUGHTERS
THE PHRASE A MEMORIAL AND HER NAME IS A TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLICAL HEBREW WORDS YARD
IT MIGHT SEEM A BIT PUZZLING THAT THIS PHRASE HAS BEEN LIFTED FROM A DISCUSSION ABOUT EUNUCHS TRADITIONALLY OUTCASTS OF COURSE BUT THE THING ABOUT EUNUCHS IS AT THEIR CHILDLESS AND SO MAY NOT HAVE ANYONE LEFT TO MOURN AND WHEN THEY'RE DEAD
LIKEWISE MANY ENTIRE FAMILIES WERE MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST AND THE FAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THEY TOO MAY HAVE NO WANT TO REMEMBER OR MOURN THE LIGHTER WHICH IS PRECISELY THE MISSION OF THE ADVERSE SHEM AND WHITE IS SO NAMED IT INSISTS THAT NO ONE WILL BE FORGOTTEN WHOEVER THEY ARE NO ONE LOST TO OBLIVION
FROM ONLINE DATABASE ROSA AND BORIS SHOWN LOOK OUT AT ME FROM MISTY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS HERE THEY'RE NOT JUST NAMELESS ABSTRACT NUMBERS AMONGST MILLIONS OF OTHERS THEY BECOME REAL
HE HAD A FACTORY SHE WAS A DOCTOR AND ROSA IS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF MY WIFE ROSA'S GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER
THE NAZIS TOOK THEIR LIVES BUT THEIR NAMES PERSIST AS THEY ALSO DO IN THAT GREAT DATABASE OF GOD'S VERY EXISTENCE A GOD THAT JEWS OFTEN REFER TO AS HASH OR SIMPLY THE NAME
FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH IT'S THAT ONE NAME IN WHOM ALL OTHER NAMES SUBSIST AND FROM WHOM THEY DRAW THEIR VERY BEING
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR GILES FRASER PRIEST IN CHARGE OF SAINT MARY NEWINGTON IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT
IMAGINE IF THERE WAS A PILL YOU CAN TAKE EVERY DAY WHICH COULD PREVENT YOU GETTING H.I.V. A PILL THAT CAN SAVE LIVES AND HAS BEEN DECLARED TO BE COST EFFECTIVE WHILE THERE IS JUST SUCH A PILL IS KNOWN AS PREP OR BY ITS BRAND NAME TRUE VADA WHICH IS BEING USED TO TREAT MEN WITH H.I.V. BUT COULD BE USED TO PREVENT THEM CATCHING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
SO FAR AT LEAST THE N.H.S. IS REFUSING TO PAY FOR IT BUT SOME GAY MEN ALREADY BY THEIR OWN SUPPLIES OVER THE INTERNET AND ISSUE HERE NOT JUST WHETHER IT'S THE JOB OF THE HEALTH SERVICE TO PAY TO ENCOURAGE BETTER SEXUAL HEALTH
BUT ALSO WHETHER THE N.H.S. SHOULD ENCOURAGE UNPROTECTED SEX I'M JOINED BY A PREP USER MILES ALEXANDER AND ALSO BROTHER BY PROFESSOR SHEENA MCCORMICK WHO IS A CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CHIEF INVESTIGATOR AM SORRY OF THE STUDY WHICH SHOWED THAT PREPPED WAS EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING H.I.V. LET ME BEGIN WITH YOU MILES FROM ME GOOD MORNING THANKS FOR COMING INTO THE STUDIO
YOU'RE PAYING FOR THIS DRUG HOW MUCH IS THAT COSTING AND SO I WAS ACTUALLY PART OF THE PROUD STUDY WHICH IS ORIGINAL TRUST THE ORIGINAL TRIAL THAT TOOK PLACE OR CLOSED IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND THAT WENT ON FOR A YEAR AND A BIT AND THEN ONCE THAT THAT TRY FINISHED I HAD TO DO MAKE THE DRUG AVAILABLE FOR
BUT AT THE TIME I NEED TO SEE ENGLAND WE'RE NOT PROMOTING IT ANYWHERE IT WASN'T AVAILABLE SO YOU HAD TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR IT YOU KNOW THIS COUNTRY'S IN AMERICA WHERE IT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON THERE AND THE HEALTH SERVICE AND
PLACES LIKE I WANT BRETT NOW AND COLLATE LOADS OF DIFFERENT CLINICS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD IT'S PROVEN TO WORK AND YOU CAN BUY THEM ON THERE FOR ABOUT FORTY FORTY NOW FOR A MONTH A MONTH SUPPLY SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF MONEY EVERY YEAR
IS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY OVER THE BUT IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY KIND OF REDUCED AND THEN IF YOU HAVE TO GO PRIVATELY THROUGH CLINICS LIKE SIXTY FOURTEEN STREET EXCEPT ARE CLEARLY THE PRIZE IS HUGE IF IT'S PREVENTING A TERRIBLE ILLNESS LIKE H.I.V. BUT OF COURSE THERE IS ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD SIMPLY NOR HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX YOU COULD USE A CONDOM YOU COULD USE A CONDOM AND I THINK ANY HEALTH ADVISER WOULD SAY IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE PERHAPS THING THE SAFEST SEX YOU CAN IT WOULD BE USING CONDOMS I'M USING PRAT HOWEVER
I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL CHOICE AND IT'S ALL A MATTER OF ASSESSING RISK AND IT'S DOWN TO INDIVIDUALS KIND OF PERCEPTION THEIR OWN SEXUAL LIBERATION HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR SEXUAL LIVES THERE WILL BE PEOPLE LISTENING THERE'D BE SOME LISTENING AT LEAST WHO SAY WELL SHOULD WE SHOULD THE TAXPAYER SHOULD THE HEALTH SERVICE PAY FOR THAT CHOICE FOR THAT SEXUAL LIBERATION
UM I THINK THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY IT'S A HARD ONE TO ANSWER BUT ALSO
IT'S IT'S DOWN TO YOU KNOW MONITORING HEALTH RISK ANYWAY THESE BEHAVIOURS AND PROBABLY MORE THAN LIKELY TO GO AHEAD WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTED INTENSIVE BY CHEST
LET ME BRING IN PROFESSOR SHEENA MCCORMACK LOSE I'M ON SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE THAT THE N.H.S. SHOULD PAY OF SO WHY I'D LIKE TO ECHO WHAT MILES SAID ACTUALLY SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS WERE INCREASING BEFORE WE HAVE
ON THE SCENE AND THE SOCIAL NORMS AND THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE CONNECT CHANGING SO DEFINING PROMISCUITY NOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DEFINE AND ACTUALLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH PROMISCUITY UNLESS IT CAUSES HARM AND WE WOULD COUNT HARM AS AN INCREASE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND ABOVE ALL H.I.V. WHICH IS AN INFECTION
WHICH YOU HAVE TO TAKE TREATMENT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE SO PREVENTING THAT IN THERE'S BEEN A THIRTY THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN GAY MEN ACROSS EUROPE IN THE LAST DECADE HE'S HE'S THE BIG GOLD OF COURSE IT IS FOR THE TAXPAYER BECAUSE THE TAXPAYER PAYS FOR THE TREATMENT FOR H.I.V. THE ARGUMENT GOING ON IS NOT WHETHER ANYBODY SHOULD SOME LETTERS IT IS WHETHER IT SHOULD COME FROM THE HEALTH SERVICE BUDGET OR WHETHER IT SHOULD COME OUT A LOCAL AUTHORITY BUDGETS COS THEY
THEY'D HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR HEALTH PREVENTION THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEN COURSE N.H.S. ENGLAND BUYERS ALL OUR H.I.V. TREATMENT DRUGS I THINK IT'S ABOUT SEVEN I'M SEVENTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR THEY ARE THE BEST COMMISSIONER TO DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN WITH FARMER THE COST OF PRATT WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN THAT MAYBE FIVE TEN MILLION MAYBE MAYBE FIFTEEN MILLION A YEAR BUT YOU'RE MUCH MORE FORTY MUCH LESS AND ONLY FOR THE TWO YEARS IN WHICH THE DRUG IS IN PATENT THE FACT THAT MILES CAN BUY IT FOR FORTY POUNDS SHOWS YOU HOW CHEAP IT IS TO MANUFACTURE IT
THERE ARE AND AS THOSE WHO ALSO WILL HOLD ON WE'VE GOT CLEAR PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES SAFE SEX IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT YOU DO YOU USE A CONDOM YOU DON'T HAVE MULTIPLE SEXUAL PARTNERS AND IT IS NOT THE JOB OF THE HEALTH SERVICE TO SAY FORGET ALL THAT JUST TAKE A PILL AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT OF COURSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CATCH SYPHILIS OR D'YOU WANT TO CATCH GONORRHOEA THESE PAINFUL INJECTIONS IN YOUR BOTTOM AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRIPS TO THE CLINIC SO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE CATCHING THOSE IN THE CONDOM STILL THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT ALL THE OTHER
INFECTIONS TOO BUT WHAT PREP DOES IS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WITH SEXUAL HEALTH SERVICE THOSE CONVERSATIONS CAN TAKE PLACE AND I SAY AGAIN YOU KNOW PREP IS SOMETHING YOU HAVING PERIODS OF YOUR LIFE
TREATMENT FOR H.I.V. IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE THAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE SO THOSE WHO ARGUE YOU MAY THINK THERE ARE PARALLELS OF THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THE PILL ALL THOSE YEARS AGO BUT THERE IS A ARGUE THAT THIS PILL WILL SIMPLY TRIGGER A NEW OUTBREAK IF YOU LIKE OF HE RESPONSIBLE SEXUAL PROMISCUITY YOUR ANSWER IS THAT IT'S MAKING PEOPLE MORE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING CONTROL THAT ADDING TO THE TOOL KIT THEY HAD TO PREVENT INFECTION AND MILES WHETHER IT'S A PAID FOR BY THE STATE OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT I AM GOING TO TAKE IT YES
AND I THINK THAT'S ALL DOWN TO AS SEXUAL LIBERATION ANTS CARRYING FOR PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WELLBEING MILES ALEXANDER PROFESSOR MCCORMACK THANKS FOR JOY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT BUT I'M FOR WEATHER FORECAST AND PETER GIBBS IS BACK WITH US

THE BILLIONAIRE PROPERTY TYCOONS THRASHING OF HIS RIVAL TED CRUISE AND INDIANA LAST NIGHT WAS HIS SEVENTH CLEAR VICTORY IN A ROW AND IN A STATE THAT IS NOT HIS NATURAL TERRITORY HE UNDOUBTEDLY HAS HUGE SUPPORT BUT AS WE HEARD EARLIER HE ALSO POLES THE HIGHEST NEGATIVES OF ANY CANDIDATE
IN THE HISTORY OF POLLING ASSIGNED THAT MANY PEOPLE JUST HATE HIM WHEN I SPOKE TO OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL EARLIER I ASKED HIM IS THAT IT IS DONALD TRUMP NOW THE REPUBLICANS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
YOU ALWAYS HESITATE IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PROCESS TO SAY THAT'S IT BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT THAT'S IT BARRING SOMETHING TOTALLY UNFORESEEN THAT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IT IS HARD TO SEE NOW
HOW DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GET THE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN DELEGATES HE NEEDS TO WIN THE NOMINATION IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE IS NOT CROWNED AS THE NOMINEE COME THE CONVENTION IN JULY AND SO IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IT IS GOING TO BE DOUBLE TRUMP VERSES HILLARY CLINTON IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER
IF ANYONE HAD PREDICTED THAT LAST JUNE WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING TO RUN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID I THINK YOU PROBABLY NEED TO GO AND HAVE A LIE DOWN SEE WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW JUST WHAT QUIETLY ROINN BEHIND HIM
I THINK THERE'LL BE AN AWFUL LOT OF SENIOR REPUBLICANS WILL BE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND SAYING WHEN I SAID THAT I THOUGHT DONALD TRUMP WAS A SLIMEBALL AND TOTALLY UNFIT TO BE PRESIDENT WHAT I REALLY WANT MEANT WAS HE IS A MAN OF ABSOLUTE INTEGRITY WHO WILL MAKE A FIRST CLASS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD I MEAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT HUMBLE PIE
BY THE BUCKET LOAD BECAUSE SO MANY BRUTAL THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID AND LOOK NOMINATION PROCESSES ARE ALWAYS ROUGH THERE IS ALWAYS IT'S ALWAYS A BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT IF YOU LIKE BUT I THINK THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BY HIS OPPONENTS
BY THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ARE VERY HARD TO WALK BACK FROM AND DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO UNITE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEHIND HIM NOW HE WAS MUCH MORE CONCILIATORY IN HIS VICTORY SPEECH BUT MY GOODNESS WHAT A JOB YOU'VE GOT AHEAD OF HIM THE VETERAN REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS ROGER STONE IS A FORMER ADVISOR TO DONALD TRUMP AND IS ALSO A LONG TIME FRIEND HE'S WORKED FOR THE PARTY AT VARIOUS TIMES SINCE THE DAYS OF RICHARD NIXON
I HAVE BEEN IMPLORING HIM AROUND PRESIDENT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I HAVE THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME
HE HAD THE SIZE AND THE TOUGHNESS IN THEIR PUBLIC PROFILE TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE KENNY IN THE END I THINK HE WAS RIGHT THE TIME WAS NEVER RIGHT UNTIL NOW
WHEN AMERICAN VOTERS ARE MORE SOUR AND THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS VERY GARRON AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS SO I THINK IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF THE TIME MEETING THE MAN AND THE TIMING WAS RIGHT FOR TRUE OUTSIDER WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN AND HE HAS FED THAT MOOD IN THE COUNTRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU COULD SAY IS THE DAMAGE THAT HE'S DONE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE OF HIS DIVISIVE FAIRLY CRUDE POLITICS
WELL I WOULD ARGUE THAT HE HASN'T GAME WE IT ALL ON FACT HE'S BROUGHT MILLIONS OF NEW VOTERS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO HERE TO FORWARD IN THE QUITE GET IT REPUBLICAN GATHERING AND THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WE'LL LOSE A LOT OF VOTERS AND LOSE THEM TO THE DEMOCRAT
I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT THIS ELECTION IS NOT TOMORROW ALL OF THE POLLING SHOWS THAT HE IS COMPETITIVE
SLIGHTLY BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON ON THE OTHER HAND ER UPON IT BERNIE SANDERS HAS REALLY NOT HIT HER ON THE AREAS WHERE SHE HAS THE GREATEST VULNERABILITY KENYA IS SECRETARY OF STATE THE FIASCO IN LIBYA NONE OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE YET PLAYED OUT IN PUBLIC BUT I THINK THEY WILL NOW BECAUSE HE WILL WHAT CONTINUE IN JUST SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE WAY AS HE HAS DONE THUS FAR
WELL I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WIN ANY OTHER WAY LOOK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY DUPLICATING THE TACTIC OF JOHN MCCAIN
GOING UP AND DOWN THE UNITED STATES TALKING ABOUT WHAT A GREAT U.S. SENATOR WHAT A GREAT AMERICAN BARACK OBAMA WAS WHEN HE SAYS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS SAID WHETHER IT'S ABOUT BANNING MUSLIMS OR OR THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE ABORTIONS HAD FACED SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT I MEAN DO YOU WORRY ABOUT
OR PERHAPS THE WHAT EFFECT THAT SORT OF THING THAT POLARISING LANGUAGE COULD HAVE ON YOUR COUNTRY AND THAT SHOE CAN LUMP ALL THOSE TOGETHER THE IDEA OF A BEER A TEMPORARY BAN AND TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL WORLD ALLOWS LUNCH
HE'S NOT ON POPULAR NOTION IN THIS COUNTRY I KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY IT MAY NOT BE UNPOPULAR BUT IS IT WISE FOR SOMEBODY IN HIS POSITION TO SET AND WONDERING ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT ALL THOSE SORT OF IDEAS AND MANY MORE THE SORT OF LANGUAGE HE USES THE THE EFFECT THAT IT HAS ON ON AMERICA ACTUALLY I JUST REJECT THE NOTION THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE NEGATIVES
IT'S STREET TALK IT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT MORE POPULAR THAN PERHAPS YOU THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THE QUESTION OF ABORTION I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIS REMARKS ON IT BUT FRANKLY
THAT ISSUE IS DWARFED BY THE ECONOMY THE THREAT OF TERRORISM THE TRADE IMBALANCES AND A PROBLEM WITH IMMIGRATION
STREETS ARE NEIGHBOURHOODS ARE NOT SAFE WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FRANCE WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY THAT'S HEADED THIS WAY UNLESS WE SECURE OUR BORDERS YOU HAVE HIS EAR YOU SPEAK TO HIM OFF AND DO YOU EVER SAY YOU WENT TOO FAR
WELL LOOK NOBODY PUTS WORDS IN DUNG PROMISE MOUTH I'VE KNOWN HIM ACTUALLY ALMOST FORTY YEARS HE IS UNSCRIPTED HE'S AND PROGRAMMED HE IS OWN COACHED HE IS WHAT HE IS HE IS NOT OPERATING ON THE BASIS OF PUBLIC OPINION POLL OR
OR FOCUS GROUPS OR OR SOME SPEECH WRITTEN BY A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET DO YOU THINK IN AMERICA WITH DONALD TRUMP AS ITS PRESIDENT WILL BE A SAFER COUNTRY YES WITHOUT ANY QUESTION
THOSE WHO DISPARAGE TRUMP WITH THE SAME PEOPLE DESPAIRED REAGAN HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE TREASURER EXCEPT FOR HE WAS PERHAPS THE GREATEST PRESIDENT MY LIFE
DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP COULD BE A GREAT PRESIDENT HE CERTAINLY COULD HE IS A DECISIVE LEADER THE JOB WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE IS BUILT
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY WOULD THOUSANDS UP AND CHLOE SHE'S ACTUALLY RUN SOMETHING AND HIS CHANCES OF BEATING HILLARY COS AS YOU POINT OUT SHE SHEILA ON THE FACE OF ETCHED HILLARY CLINTON WOULD BE AHEAD WOULD WIN BECOME PRESIDENT IF SHE WERE UP AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AS WE SAY HERE DON'T BET THE WRETCH
ROGER STONE THERE WELL JIM NOTTIE IS HERE IN THE STUDIO JIM NICK BRYANT SAID EARLIER THAT HE'S HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS COMPLETE I MEAN IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT NO WAS A REPUBLICAN PARTY HITS THE PARTY ISN'T HE'S THE NOMINATION IS HE'S THE PARTY IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT
SENIOR FIGURES IN THE PUBLIC PARTY HAVE SAID ABOUT HIM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS MITT ROMNEY THE CANDIDATE IN TWENTY TWELVE SAID HE WAS A RACIST A MISOGYNIST A FRAUD A CON MAN HIS ECONOMIC PLAN WAS FOURTH GRADE PRIMARY SCHOOL PLAN JOHN MCCAIN WHO INCIDENTALLY IS SAID YOU SAID A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE'S NOT GOING TO GO TO THE CONVENTION HE SO DISGUSTED AS BASICALLY SAID HE DOESN'T THINK
A TRUMP IS FIT TO BE PRESIDENT COULD CRUISE OF COURSE WHO DROPPED OUT LAST NIGHT NOT MENTIONING TRUMP AND HIS SPEECH HAS CALLED THEM VULGAR COARSE A MAN WITH A CORRUPT RELATIONSHIP TO THE GOVERNMENT NOW JOHN TOTAL WAS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND SEEING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT HUMBLE PIE OF COURSE MANY OF THEM WILL DO THAT
BUT MANY WON'T BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THE WORDS ARE OUT THERE THERE ARE AND THAT THEY'RE ON TAPE THEY WATCH EVERY DEMOCRATIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE SENIOR REPUBLICAN FIGURES SIDING WITH HILLARY CLINTON FROM THE DEMOCRAT WELL I THINK SOME OF THEM WILL BUT THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO PUBLICLY JEB BUSH HAS SAID THAT HE DOESN'T THINK TRUMP IS FIT TO BE PRESIDENT BUT IT WOULD BE ODD TO FIND A BUSH SUPPORTING A CLINTON
LOOK THE TRUMP AS ROGER STONE SAID THERE IS UNSCRIPTED HE'S OFF THE WAR HE IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF CANDIDATE A HE ARE STIRRED UP AN EXTRAORDINARY FIRE STORM STORM AMONG PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT WERE DISAFFECTED WHO LOATHES THE WAY POLITICS IS DONE AND THAT IS
A DANGER FOR THE CLINTON COME IT WILL BE A CLINTON CAMPAIGN ALL THOSE SANDERS SNEAK ANOTHER WIN IN INDIANA LAST NIGHT IT WILL BE A COOK OR CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THEN A TWO HORSE RACE ROGER STONE SAID DON'T BET THE RANCH HE'S RIGHT I MEAN IT SHE'S RUNNING A NATIONAL POLL SEVEN OR EIGHT POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP MANY REPUBLICANS BELIEVE HE WILL BE A CATASTROPHIC CANDIDATE BUT IN A TWO HORSE RACE
DON'T BELIEVE HIM HE CAN'T WIN IT'S POSSIBLE IF YOU WATCH THE ENTHUSIASM THAT HE STIRS UP IT IS PALPABLE PUNT AND DON'T FORGET TRUMP IS
A T.V. STAR OF LONG STANDING IN THE STATES AND PEOPLE ARE DISAFFECTED WITH POLITICS THEY'RE FASCINATED BY HIM YOU GO TO A TRUMP RALLY YOU TWO OR THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM
I'VE JUST HAD A LOOK AT HIS HAIR BECAUSE THEY'RE FASCINATED BY THIS MAN HE DOES HAVE AN ELECTRIC PRESENCE NOW HE SAYS SOME
VERY VERY ODD THINGS I'M NOT SAYING THAT WAS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW BUT IT IT JUST UNCONNECTED THINGS WHICH ARE WEIRD IN THAT STATEMENT THE OTHER DAY ABOUT TED CRUISES FATHER BUT BEING PHOTOGRAPHED NEXT TO LEE HARVEY OSWALD CAME STRAIGHT FROM THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER I MEAN THIS BREAKS ALL THE RULES OF POLITICS IT'S BIZARRE BUT
IN THE GUTS I'LL BE PUTTING FROM CALIFORNIA NEXT WEEK ON ON THE LATINO TINO'S VOTE AND ON THE QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION IT'S A HUGE QUESTION MARIKA AND HILLARY CLINTON IS A VULNERABLE CANDIDATE ODDLY ENOUGH BERNIE SANDERS HAS SHOWN THAT DONALD TRUMP AS CRUISE HAS ALWAYS SAID HE'S A CHAMELEON HE'LL SAY ANYTHING HE'LL DO ANYTHING HE'LL MOVE YOU DON'T
RULE HIM OUT AS A VERY SERIOUS CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY JIM THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE DECADES TURKS ABOUT TO APPLY FOR VISAS TO TRAVEL TO THE EUROPEAN UNION OFTEN TAKING WEEKS SOMETIMES BEING REFUSED TODAY WILL HEAR OF THAT MIGHT COME TO AN END WHEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REPORT ON WHETHER TURKEY SHOULD GET VISA FREE TRAVEL FOR THE SHINGEN ZONE THAT'S MOST OF THE E.U. CRUCIALLY NOT BRITAIN TURKS WOULD STILL NEED VISAS TO WORK ANYWHERE IN THE E.U.
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL TO STOP THE E.U. MIGRATION CRISIS BUT CRITICS SAY IT WOULD BE REWARDING THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS IT CLAMPS DOWN ON FREE SPEECH AND HUMAN RIGHTS OR TURKEY CORRESPONDENT THOUGH AND NOW REPORTS
A TYPICALLY TRAFFIC CLOGGED ROAD IN CENTRAL ISTANBUL THE MIDDAY SUN IS BEATING DOWN ON A CUE
FORMED OUTSIDE THE JOINT VISA APPLICATION CENTRE
WRITTEN ABOVE THE TAUGHT THE EIGHTEEN COUNTRIES USING THE SERVICE FROM AUSTRIA TO POLO
ALL PART OF THE E.U. SHINGEN ZONE AND ALL REQUIRING A VISA FOR WHICH TURKS STILL NEED TO APPLY
I'M JUST GONNA GO UP AND TALK TO ONE OF THOSE QUEUING WHAT'S YOUR NAME MEHMET MEHMET WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO APPLY FOR A VISA
WE SHALL HAVE SOME PEPPERS ROGER YOU'RE DOING INTO GEAR MY NAME AND IS IT IS A DIFFICULT PROCESS OF COURSE IS DIFFICULT
THIS CENTURY IT'S OFF COURSE DIFFICULT LONG DO YOU WANT OF COURSE ON THERE
BUT IT'S A REQUIREMENT TO BRUSSELS MIGHT NOW RECOMMEND TO LIFT AS PART OF A DEAL TO SOLVE THE E.U. MIGRATION CRISIS FAILED ASYLUM SEEKERS HAVE BEGUN TO BE DEPORTED BACK TO TURKEY AND IN RETURN TURKS COULD GET VISA FREE TRAVEL TO THE SHINGEN ZONE
FOR THOSE WAITING HERE IT COULDN'T COME SOON ENOUGH BY FOUND IT'S INSULTING AND UNACCEPTABLE
MAYBE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET THIS AND IS A FLEA ARE PUSHING US THAT IT'S GOING TO BE
NOT BECAUSE OF A RICE OR A SESSION PROCESS IS WANTON BECAUSE OFTHE REFUGES LIVES BECAUSE OF THIS UNBELIEVABLE SHAMEFUL MARGARET
OH ANKARA HAS STRUCK A HARD BARGAIN WITH MOST OF THE REFUGEE BOATS LEAVING FROM TURKEY IT HAS LEVERETS OVER EUROPE
BY RE ADMITTING MIGRANTS DEPORTED FROM GREECE AND CLAMPING DOWN ON SMUGGLERS TURKEY HAS ENSURED MIGRANT ARRIVALS ARE RADICALLY DOWN BUT THE QUID PRO QUO IS VISA FREE TRAVEL THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER AHMED DOUBLE TOTAL WELCOMING ANGELA MERKEL TO SOUTHERN TURKEY LAST MONTH WAS CLEAR NO VISA WAIVER NO MIGRATION
THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL HAS BEEN TURKEYS DREAM SINCE HAD APPLIED FOR E.U. MEMBERSHIP DECADES AGO OTHER COUNTRIES FROM THE WESTERN BALKANS TO SOUTH AMERICA HAVE ACHIEVED
BUT THE E.U. IS MORE APPREHENSIVE SOMEHOW WHEN IT COMES TO TURKEY AND THERE'S EURO SCEPTICISM AND RIGHT WING GROUPS HAVE GROWN ACROSS THE E.U. SO HER FEARS ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION STRONG MUSLIM COUNTRY
THE PROFESSOR OF EUROPEAN STUDIES SAID EM I DIDN'T DO IT SAYS THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN UNNECESSARILY EXAGGERATED
MANY OF THE PUBLIC AND EVEN SOME OF THE POLITICAL ELITE THEY HAVE THIS IMAGE OF MILLIONS OF TURKS FLOODING INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION LOOKING FOR WORK BUT THIS WOULD NOT REALLY BE THE CASE BECAUSE WE THE POSITION DOESN'T GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO WORK IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO SEEK A SOCIAL WELFARE BENEFITS OR ANY OF
BUT IS IT THE RIGHT TIME TO REWARD AN INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN TURKEY THIS IS A GOVERNMENT THAT TEAR GAS TO THOSE PROTESTING IT'S RECENT TAKEOVER OF THE BIGGEST OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER THAT IS ACCUSED OF RENEWED VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN KURDISH AREAS THAT IS IMPRISONING JOURNALISTS AND ACADEMICS FOR INSULTING THE PRESIDENT CRITICS SAY BRUSSELS IS SWEEPING THAT UNDER THE CARPET IN A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO HALT THE MIGRATION CRISIS
BUT I AM C. T. V. IN OPPOSITION CHANNEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO TAKE OFF THEIR PRESENTER BARN WHO GIVE EM WORRIES ABOUT PLUMMETING PRESS FREEDOM HERE AND EUROPE KOWTOWING TO PRESIDENT AND WON THE EAH
SHOULD STICK ON ITS PRINCIPLES THE STEIN IF EVERYTHING WILL BE GIVEN TO DO TURKISH GOVERNMENT I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND ARID I WANT HESITATE TO TAKE OVER ALL THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE HERE IN TURKEY
IS MY LADY EQUITY SPICER'S I'VE BEEN CONNED
EUROPEAN TOURISTS HAVE OF COURSE LONG BEEN A MAINSTAY OF ISTANBUL SOME OF THEM HUNTING BARGAINS HERE IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPICE BAZAAR
TRAFFIC IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOWARDS EUROPE FINALLY BE EASED IT'S TAKEN THE WORST MIGRATION CRISIS SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR TO SPEED THIS UP
BUT TURKEY NOW SENSES A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COUNTRY ON TWO CONTINENTS FINALLY TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE EUROPEAN
REPORTS REPORTING IT'S NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND ROB IS BACK WITH A SWAB THANK SARAH HELLO AGAIN WITH THE FOOTBALL FOCUS THIS EVENING SWITCHES IS FROM THE CITY OF LEICESTER TO THE SPANISH CAPITAL IN THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI FINAL SECOND LEG BETWEEN REAL MADRID AND MANCHESTER CITY HOME ADVANTAGE OF COURSE A RAIL BUT AFTER A NIL NIL FIRST LEG IN MANCHESTER THEY DO LACK THAT CRUCIAL AWAY GOAL WHICH COUNTS DOUBLE IN THE EVENT OF AN AGGREGATE DRAWER I THOUGHT THE CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY LOOKS AHEAD
AND SO WITH LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF MATCHES LEFT IN WHICH HE CAN CALL HIMSELF THE MANAGER OF MANCHESTER CITY MANUEL PELLEGRINI HAS BROUGHT HIS TEAM TO MADRID WHERE HE SPENT JUST THE ONE SEASON AS COACH OF THE NOW RECORD TEN TIMES EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS
UNLIKE LAST WEEK IN THE FIRST LEG THEY'LL HAVE TO COPE WITH CRISTIANO RONALDO WHO'S BEEN DECLARED FIT TO PLAY REAL HAVE NETTED EIGHTEEN GOALS WITHOUT REPLY HERE IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE THIS SEASON BUT A SCORE DRAW WE DO IT FOR CITY AND SEE PELLEGRINI BOW OUT AFTER THE FINAL IN MILAN AND THAT'D BE AGAINST ATHLETICO MADRID WHO DID GET IN THE WAY GO LAST NIGHT AT MUNICH LOSING TO ON THE NIGHT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AFTER AN AGGREGATE TWO ALL DRAW
YOU'RE BACK PAGES MEANWHILE ARE STILL SAVOURING LEICESTER CITY'S PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE MOSTLY IN PARTY STYLE PICTURES BUT ALSO WITH ONE OR TWO QUOTES ANSWERING THE FEARFUL QUESTION ON THE LIPS OF MANY LEICESTER FANS CAN MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI HOLD ON TO HIS PLAYERS HE SAYS HE'S STAYING AND HE WANTS TO SEE PLAYERS ARRIVING NOT DEPARTING BUT ALSO ADDING THAT HE WOULDN'T WANT TO HOLD ON TO UNHAPPY PLAYERS WERE ROBBIE SAVAGE PLAYED FOR LEICESTER AND MANY OTHER CLUBS BESIDES MONEY ROBBIE COULD MY HARRY SO THEY EAT THE THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS WOULD YOU STAY IN THIS SITUATION OR WOULD YOU GO
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S I THINK IT'S ALREADY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK HE KEEPS ALL OF THIS IS HIS SQUAD MARROWS CAN SAY NOTHIN JAMIE VOWED HE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY WANT TO STAY BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT HOOEY BRINGS IN BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE DYNAMIC OF THE SQUAD
YOU KNOW THE TEAM SPIRIT IF IF THAT'S AFFECTED THEN THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM YES THAT IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE LEICESTER MAKE UP ISN'T IT THAT THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THEIR PARTS AS I THINK I SAID YESTERDAY
THEY'VE GOT ONE OR TWO SUPERSTARS IN IS INVALUABLE ALWAYS GOES CAN HIM HAVE THE PART BUT THE MOST
FOR ME THE SEASON HAS BEEN THE DYNAMIC OF THE SQUAD THE TEAM SPIT AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW GAME CALLED BATTLE BORN AND THAT SHOWS FOUR PER CENT OF FANS
THINK LESS OF THE TEAM SPIRIT THE RESEARCH DONE SO YES FANS APPRECIATE WHAT LEICESTER OF THEM YES THIS IS A VIDEO GAME AND OF COURSE OTHER VIDEO GAMES WE MUST INSIST ARE AVAILABLE BUT YOU MOVE ON PLENTY OF CLEARING UP TO DO AFTER THAT'S CHELSEA SPURS MATCH TO BRAWLS TWELVE YELLOW CARDS WE'VE GOT RATHER BELLY DIDN'T IT BENEATH THAT LEFT THE CELEBRATIONS YOU KNOW STRANGE OF COURSE TO THE OCCASIONAL CAUTION YOURSELF I WASN'T WHY DO PLAYERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES PROFESSIONAL ALLOW THEMSELVES TO LOSE IT IN THAT WAY WELL IT'S THE ADRENALIN IS THAT
AT THE MOMENT AND THAT GAME REMINDED ME OF GAMES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT WAS JUST EVERYBODY WAS GETTING STUCK IN THERE WAS TACKLES FLYING EVERYWHERE AND I'VE GOTTA SAY I'M WANT TO CRITICISE REFEREES ON SIX OR SIX BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY MY CLAMBERED HANDLED IT VERY VERY WELL BUT

HERR SHRINKS LESS OSLO'S IT USED TO BE CUTTING BUT THE GENERAL POINT HOWEVER ROMANTIC THE LEICESTER STORY MIGHT BE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE IT IS THE GAME STILL APPEARS TO HAVE CYNICISM AND CHEATING AT ITS CORE THIS IS THAT FAIR
IT'S SUCH A A DEBATE I THINK IT'S AS AN IT AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS A PLAY WHEN YOU GO STEP ONTO THAT FOOTBALL PITCH I WAS OF THE MINDSET YOU DO WHAT YOUR CANCER WHEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY DIVE IN THIS GAME MORE FEARED AND INJURIES GET MORE
IT'S YEAH IT'S DIVING IS THAT HE'S PROBABLY

TIME TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER AND IT'S ACTUALLY FINALLY AT LAST GETTING WARMER AND WILL DO IN THE DAYS AHEAD DRY WITH SUNNY SPELLS IN MOST PLACES YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND NICK ROBINSON AND TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE DIANA SPEED HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS
DONALD TRUMP APPEARS TO HAVE ALL THAT SECURED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AFTER HIS VICTORY IN THE INDIANA PRIMARY KNOCKED HIS CLOSEST RIVAL TED CREWS OUT OF THE RACE MY URGED HIS PARTY TO UNITE BEHIND HIM
DAVID CAMERON IS FACING GROWING PRESSURE TO ACCEPT MORE CHILD SYRIAN REFUGEES THE LATEST CALL HAS COME FROM THE HEAD OF A GROUP OF JEWISH REFUGEES WHO ARRIVED IN BRITAIN FROM NAZI GERMANY AS CHILDREN MINISTERS ARE TO MEET CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THIS AFTERNOON TO TRY TO AVOID DEFEAT ON THE ISSUE IN THE COMMONS NEXT WEEK
AT LEAST SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE CANADIAN CITY OF FORT MCMURRAY WHERE A WILDFIRE HAS STARTED TO TAKE HOLD THE FLAMES ARE SAID TO HAVE DESTROYED A MOBILE HOME PARK BUT FIREFIGHTERS SAY THEY'VE MANAGED TO PUT OUT SOME ISOLATED FIRES
RESEARCH SUGGESTS MORE THAN A QUARTER OF BRITAIN'S CARE HOMES AREN'T PROFITABLE AND COULD CLOTHES WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS THE OPERATORS HAVE FIVE THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BORROWED AN AVERAGE OF NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE VALUE OF THEIR BUSINESSES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DIANA TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TERRIBLE PLIGHT OF CHILDREN WHO FLED FROM WAR OR GRINDING POVERTY TO TRY TO MAKE THEIR WAY ALONE IN EUROPE WHAT IS DEBATED IS WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY THEY ARE THE PRIME MINISTER IS ARGUED THAT IT IS BRITAIN'S DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET MADE IT TO SO CALLED SAFE COUNTRY
HE SAID COUNTRIES BUT HE'S UNDER MOUNTING PRESSURE TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE ALREADY IN EUROPE AND IF HE DOESN'T DO SO HE COULD FACE DEFEAT NOT JUST IN THE LORDS AS HE HAS ALREADY BUT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AS WELL LEAVING THOSE CALLING FOR A RE THINK OF THOSE WHO WERE GIVEN REFUGE HERE WHEN THEY FLED FROM THE NAZIS THE SO CALLED KINDERTRANSPORT CHILDREN SIR ERIC RIGHT JOINS US IN THE STUDIO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF JEWISH REFUGEES
AND HAS WRITTEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER JOINING US TO HEIDI OUT THEM THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO IS ONE OF THOSE MEETING THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER JAMES BROKEN SHOWER TODAY ALONG WITH OTHER POTENTIAL REBELS TO ERIC OF COURSE YOU CAME BACK
YOU CAME HERE WHAT AGE FOR WAR IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE THAT IS CORRECT AND YOU SEE PARALLELS BETWEEN YOUR PLIGHT AND THE PLIGHT OF THESE CHILDREN NOTHING IS IDENTICAL IN THIS WORLD BUT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES VERY SERIOUS SIMILARITIES AND THE TRUTH IS THAT ALL THESE CHILDREN THAT CAVE
WE WERE NINE NEARLY TEN THOUSAND WE CONTRIBUTED BACK TO THE COUNTRY A NEW SPOKEN IN YOUR LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE ECHOES OF THE PAST HAUNTING YOU AND FELLOW KINDER
THEY DO THEY HAUNT US VERY VERY MUCH MOST OF US NEVER SAW HER PARENTS AGAIN SO IN THAT SENSE AND I'M LUCKY I WAS VERY VERY YOUNG
AND THEREFORE I REMEMBER VERY LITTLE BUT A LOT OF THE KINDER WHO WERE ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN
REMEMBER THEIR PARENTS WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRIME MINISTER AND OTHERS SAY NO HOLD ON IT ISN'T QUITE THE SAME AS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY FLEEING GENOCIDE SOME OF THEM ARE NOT COME FROM SYRIA THEY'VE COME FROM AFGHANISTAN FROM ERITREA PLACES WHERE TERRIBLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY REACHED RELATIVE SAFETY IN EUROPE WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
WELL I SAY THAT LOOK THEY'RE FLEEING BECAUSE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEIR LIVES ARE AT STAKE AND CONSEQUENTLY I THINK I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD LEAST OVER THE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN
WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED AND WENT THAT HAVE WHAT IS EUPHEMISTICALLY CALLED A PULL FACTOR IN OTHER WORDS SIMPLY SAY TO OTHER PARENTS OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE SO MORE CHILDREN OVER TAKE THE RISK BECAUSE IF YOU DO THEY'LL END UP IN BRITAIN
IT MAY YOU JUST DON'T KNOW BUT AT THE MOMENT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PLATE OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN SOME WHO'VE GOT LOST PEOPLE CAN'T BE FOUND AND TO TAKES APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN INTO THIS COUNTRY AND HELP THEM WILL HELP US
HOWDY LIFT OR SITTING ALONGSIDE YOU HEAR THE PROMISE THERE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CLEARER IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COULD BE PUBLICLY AS WELL AS PRIVATELY I THINK IN MEETINGS WERE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL INCREASE THIS SO CALLED PULL FACTOR BUT WE WILL HE SAYS CARRY ON AS A GOVERNMENT TAKING PEOPLE WHO WERE IN REFUGEE CAMPS CLOSE TO SIR
THAT'S RIGHT AND THEY HAVE THE ADDITIONAL THREE THOUSAND IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT ROUND ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AGO NOW WAS OF COURSE BRILLIANT NEWS BECAUSE YOU KNOW ANY DESPERATE CHILDREN AND FAMILY THAT YOU'RE TAKING FROM SUCH AN INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE BACK KIND OF COURSE HE'S WELCOME
BUT THE PRIME MINISTER MENTIONED IN P.M.Q.S LAST WEEK AND YOU JUST REFER TO IT AGAIN NOW RELATIVE SAFETY IN EUROPE IT IS NOT RELATIVELY SAFE TO BE PULLED INTO TRAFFICKING AND PROSTITUTION TALK TO THE DOCTORS OR MEDICINE I'LL FIND THEY ARE LITERALLY STITCHING UP CHILDREN ON A DAILY BASIS AND SENDING THEM BACK TO THEIR CAMPS THAT IS NOT THE SAFETY THAT YOU AND I THINK OF WHEN WE THINK OF EUROPE SO THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT SAFE AT ALL MAY NEED OUR HELP SO WHEN YOU MEET THE MINISTER LATER TODAY YOU WILL SAY YOU'VE GOT TO BACK DOWN
HE MAY SAY WE'RE TOLD HER LOOK THERE IS A SCHEME THAT ALLOWS US TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT SOME RELATIVE OR DISTANT RELATIVE SOMETIMES NOT JUST A BROTHER OR SISTER POSSIBLY AN UNCLE AND AUNT WHO ALREADY LIVES IN BRITAIN MAYBE WE COULD SPEED THAT UP WITH THAT SATISFY YOU IT WILL BE A GREAT START AND BECAUSE THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF CHILDREN WHO ARE LITERALLY UNABLE TO GET INTO THE SYSTEM THE SIT ONCE YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN CLAIM ASYLUM AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE A RELATIVE OVER HERE THAN THE PROCESS BEGINS
THAT IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION WE HAVE ALREADY DUBLIN THREE PEOPLE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT PHRASE BUT IT'S NOT HAPPEN QUICKLY ENOUGH AND ACTUALLY IF WE CAN ESTABLISH WHERE THOSE CHILDREN ARE AND WHO THEY ARE THEN THE NUMBER THE MAGICAL NUMBER THREE THOUSAND ALMOST BECOMES ACADEMIC IT'S ABOUT FINDING THOSE THAT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HERE BUT WE KNOW DON'T WE THAT IN TERMS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE CALAIS CAMP JUST TWENTY THREE OF THEM MET THAT CRITERIA IN OTHER WORDS OF HAVING A RELATIVE HERE IN THE U.K. NOT AT ALL AT THE LAST COUNT THERE WAS A CENSUS
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY A COUPLE OF SELF APPOINTED CHARITIES CITIZENS YOU KAY AND HELP REFUGEES AT THE LAST COUNT AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT ROUND ABOUT HUNDRED THIRTY CHILDREN WENT WENT MISSING WHEN THE JUNGLE WAS HALF DEMOLISHED LORD ONLY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM OF THOSE THAT REMAIN THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN THE REGION HUNDRED FIFTY EITHER SOUGHT A COMPROMISE YOU COULD LIVE WITH
SIMPLE QUESTION IT COMES DOWN TO YOUR VOTE IN THE END YOU ARE HIGHLY CRITICAL BEFORE BUT YOU DECIDED THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A VERY TO ABSTAIN BRETT NOT TO VOTE AGAINST IN TRUTH IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ARE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN ON ME BUT I AM THIS TIME AND MANY ARE THE ONLY REASON I BY ABSTAIN FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT FELT DISRESPECTFUL TO THOSE THREE THOUSAND AND I WANTED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH MINISTERS YOU'RE CLEAR MESSAGES YOU AND ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DEFEAT THE GOVERNMENT M.P.S
WILL REBEL IF THEY DON'T BACK DOWN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU HEIDI ELM THANK YOU SIR ERIC RIGHT IT'S NOT TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE

ISRAELIS A NERVOUS SINCE OCTOBER LAST YEAR PALESTINIANS MOSTLY ARMED WITH KNIVES OF LAUNCH DOZENS OF A
PALESTINIAN EXPLODED A BOMB ON A BUS AND JERUSALEM LAST MONTH FOR ISRAELIS THAT REVIVED HORRIFIC MEMORIES OF BUS ATTACKS THAT KILLED HUNDREDS IN THE LAST PALESTINIAN UPRISING

WE HATE THEM IT'S MUTUAL BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO COME TO ATTACK
BACK IN THE NINETIES WHEN THE PEACE PROCESS STARTED THERE WAS A SENSE OF HOPE THAT THINGS MIGHT GET BETTER BUT NOW THERE IS NOTHING
IN FACT HERE ON THE WEST BANK THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER
A PALESTINIAN VILLAGE AND THE VILLAGE IS CLOSE TO JERUSALEM AS THE CROW FLIES
ACTUALLY IT'S A WORLD AWAY MOST OF THE PALESTINIANS WHO LIVE HERE CAN'T TRAVEL TO JERUSALEM TO THE HOLY CITY BECAUSE OF ISRAEL'S SECURITY REGULATIONS
MOURNERS GATHERED AT THE HOUSE OF THE TACK AT A FAMILY

THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT'S UNTRUE THAT PALESTINIANS ATTACK ISRAELIS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO HATE THEM FROM CHILDHOOD
ALL THE HILDA SOME ISRAELIS DISAGREE WHEN IS YEHUDA SHOW
HE NEEDS A GROUP OF FORMER SOLDIERS FROM THE ISRAEL DEFENCE FORCES THE I.D.F. THEY CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE OCCUPATION IN A GROUP CALLED BREAKING THE SILENCE WE BELIEVE THE OCCUPATION IS MORALLY INDIFFERENCE
WE BELIEVE THE OCCUPATION AS MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S DESTROYING THE MORALITY OF THE I.D.F. IT'S DESTROYING THE MORALITY OF ISRAELI SOCIETY IT'S DESTROYING THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE I.D.F. ARMIES ARE NOT DESIGNED
TO RULE AN OCCUPATION FOR FIFTY YEARS OVER MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND WE BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG TERM IT DESTROYS A STRATEGIC END SECURITY STANDING OF ISRAEL ON THE REGION THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AGAINST THE OCCUPATION
WE WERE IN HEBRON A MAJOR FLASHPOINT WHEN JEWISH SETTLERS SPOTTED YEHUDA SHOW ALL THEY SWORE AT HIM AND CALLED HIM A TRAITOR
THE ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK INCLUDING EAST JERUSALEM IS MORE COMBUSTIBLE THAN IT'S BEEN SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND PALESTINIAN UPRISING OVER A DECADE AGO
HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT NEITHER SIDE CAN DECISIVELY BEAT THE OTHER ONE DAY THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE A PEACE DEAL
IF NOT THEY FACE THE SLOW DRIP OF HATE AND THE CERTAINTY OF MORE KILLER
JEREMY BOWEN REPORTING THERE IT'S A QUARTER TO NINE NOW THIS MORNING WE'VE BEEN LOOK AT THE VIEW FROM GERMANY OF THE U.K. A REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP OR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE JOINS US AGAIN FROM HANOVER AND FROM OUTSIDE ONE OF THE CITY'S MOST ICONIC BUILDINGS BONHAM
GOOD MORNING NICK ACTUALLY THE VIEW FROM GERMANY FOR ME RIGHT NOW LOOKS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE I'VE MOVED FROM MY ASPARAGUS STALL AT THE STATION I'M ON TOP OF ONE OF THE
BIGGEST BANKS IN GERMANY THE NORD LANDERS BANK I'M LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE CHURCH SPIRES AND STEEP RED ROOFS OF THIS CITY FRANKFURTER GETS THE COVERAGE BUT PEN OVER ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SERVICES AND INSURANCE INDUSTRY
AND THERE'S A DIRECT BRITISH CONNECTION OF COURSE THIS IS HOME TO ANCESTORS OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN THE HOUSE OF HANOVER IT IS HOME ALSO TO COME TO DUNKEL THE C.E.O. OF LORD LANDIS BANK GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
WHAT IS THAT THE VIEW OF BUSINESS IN GERMANY IF YOU CAN CHARACTERISE IT GENERALLY TO THE PROSPECT OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
I THINK THE CLEAR MAJORITY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS OF BUSINESS IN GERMAN HE WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE OTHER IMPORTANT UNION THEIR WORRY IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESS BUT ALSO THEIR BUSINESS DRIVEN ASPECT TO EVERY KIND OF SUB OFF LIVE LIFE THEY WANT TO STAY THEY WANT THEY WANT THE BRITS TO STAY FOR
WE OFTEN TALK IN BRITAIN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY OF LONDON IF BRITAIN WERE TO LEAVE AND SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
LARGE BANKS AND OTHERS MIGRATING EAST TOWARDS CITIES LIKE FRANKFURT I MEAN THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT CERTAINLY IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND INSURANCE AND ELSEWHERE IT COULD BE A BOON FOR GERMANY COULDN'T IT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE AND THOSE MAJOR COMPANIES WERE TO RELOCATE
REALLY PERSONALLY I THINK IT WOULD LOOK OUT IT WOULD HAVE TO TEMPER YOUR PLATE I DON'T ADULT IT WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE A LOSE LOSE ACTUALLY BOTH OF THE LOOS IF BRITTANY WHAT EXIT
BY THE WAY WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE FOR THOSE COMPANIES
TRYING TO WORK WITHIN THE EUROZONE TO ACTUALLY COME AND LOCATE WITHIN IT AND TO REMAIN A PART OF THE E.U. STRUCTURE WHICH BRITAIN OF COURSE WOULD NOT BE AT THAT POINT SOME OF THEM THEY'LL HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY AND PART OF THE BUSINESS IS
BUT I THINK THE REAL PUNY UNION AS SUCH HE'S SUCH A SORT OF PROPELLER TO THEIR BUSINESS THAT NET RESULT WOULD BE NOT POSITIVE IT'S
SORT OF A JOB AND SO A NET ECONOMIC LOSS FOR GERMANY AND THE REST IN THE E.U. AS A RESULT OF BRITAIN BRITAIN AND BRITAIN AS WELL SO I DON'T THINK I THINK IT'S REALLY A LOSE LOSE PROPOSITION DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE CITY OF HANOVER PATRIK
VERY LIMITED ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK SHORT TO MID TERM LONG TERM IT COULD BE BAD NOT REALLY THE INDUSTRY HE IS NOT REALLY DEPENDENT WE ARE FINANCIAL SERVICES HAP BUT THEY'RE NOT THE BIGGEST IN GERMANY SO IT WOULD BE VERY LIMITED I THINK IT'S MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE AT LEAST IN THE FIRST PHASE
WE HAVEN'T GOT LONG LEFT BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS COMES UP WITH BUSINESS IN BRITAIN THE RED TAPE THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE E.U. TO GERMAN BUSINESSES COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT AS WELL ABSOLUTELY AND THEY COMPLAIN
AS THE BRITS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE BRITS IN THE E.U. TO CUT THE RED TAPE ALSO IN THE NAME OF GERMAN INDUSTRY
I JUST WANT TO PICK UP ONE FINAL THING I MENTIONED YOU'RE THE C.E.O. OF THIS BANK YOU ALSO THE HONORARY CONSUL OF THE U.K. HERE IN HANOVER HOW ON EARTH DOES THAT WORK HAVING A GERMAN HONORARY CONSUL TO THE U.K. I REALLY HAVEN'T GOT A SPLIT PERSONALITY AS BOTH I THINK THE BRITS SHOULD STAY IN BUT YES THAT'S RIGHT I'M A HALFWIT IN THAT SENSE OH KAY WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US
FROM THIS MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF HANOVER AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR GERMAN VIEW IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME WILL BE IN SPAIN LOOKING AT THE VIEWS OF BRITISH EXPATS LIVING THERE AND ALSO THE SPANISH ON THIS WHOLE BRITISH BRICKS IT DEBATE MATTHEW THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TONIGHT
GET ON WITH IT STOP HANGING ABOUT MAKE A DECISION THAT IN SUMMARY IS THE CALL FROM THE TRANSPORT COMMITTEE AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TODAY THEY SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS UNNECESSARILY DELAYING THE CHOICE BETWEEN HEATHROW AND GATWICK AS THE BEST WAY TO EXPAND BRITAIN'S AIRPORTS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE LOUISE ELMAN JOINS US HERE AS DOES DANIEL MOYLAN THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF TRANSPORT FOR LONDON AND AN ADVISER ON AVIATION TO BORIS JOHNSON THE MAYOR OF LONDON FOR ONE MORE DAY THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING IN TO JOIN US LOUISE
THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO TELL US MINISTERS WERE THEY BEFORE THAT MAYORAL ELECTION TOMORROW WHAT THEIR DECISION WAS SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS REPORT
THIS TIME A DECISION WAS TAKEN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS HAVE TO BE BALANCED AND THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN INTENSE INVESTIGATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES INCLUDING TWO AND A HALF YEAR STUDY EARTHY DAVIS COMMISSION AND EVEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAY WHICH THEIR PREFERRED LOCATION
THERE WILL BE MORE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THERE WILL BE THE START OF THE COMPLETED YOUR PLANNING PROCESS THAN INVEST A DECISION IS TAKEN TO THE U.K. THERE WAS OUTED LINKS WITH EMERGING MARKETS THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF TRADE THAT WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IT'S TIME FOR A DECISION DANIEL MOYLAN HE'S THE DELAY IN HER DECISION SIMPLY POLITICAL JOB SIMPLY WAIT SEE WHO THE NEXT MARY'S NO IT'S BECAUSE THE WORK HASN'T BEEN DONE IN THE DANGEROUS PART OF THIS REPORT FROM THE DISINGENUOUS PART
IS TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE A DECISION FIRST AND WORK OUT THE COSTS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AS YOU GO ALONG AFTERWARDS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING THAT AS IT HAPPENS THE GOVERNMENT TOOK THE DAVIES REPORT FINAL RECOMMENDATION AND ACTUALLY PUT IN THE BIN AND THEY WENT BACK AND THEY SAID WE'RE GOING TO GO AND LOOK AT THE INTERIM REPORT THAT THEY PRODUCED AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE THREE OPTIONS THERE AND WE CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE I UNDERSTAND THAT WORK IS TAKING PLACE I DIDN'T MATCH READY I'M NOT HERE TO SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNMENT PUT IT IN THE BIN BECAUSE
I THINK THAT I COULD TELL YOU WHY I THINK SOMETIMES YOU HAVE SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA BUT YOU CAN'T SEE WHY MY EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T AGREE WITH IT AND YOU TRY AND YOU TRY AND YOU TRY AGAIN AND YOU CONSTANTLY FAIL THIS THIRD RUNWAY AT HEATHROW HAS CONSTANTLY FAILED I THINK THERE COMES A POINT
WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAY MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA AFTER ALL WHO IS AND ANOTHER THERE IS A PERFECTLY GOOD ARGUMENT FOR DELAY WILL THE GOVERNMENT TOLD US THAT THEY DO AT SCEPTRE DAVIS'S SHORT LIST BUT THEY NEEDED TO DO MORE WORK AND THE WORK CAN'T GO ON FOREVER THAT MEANS NO DECISION THE U.K. HE MISSING OUT AND OF COURSE DANIEL DID SUPPORT THE COMPLETELY NEW AIRPORT NESTORIUS AIRPORT WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT MONTHS OTHER THINGS CLOSING DOWN HEATHROW THAT WAS TOTALLY REJECTED
THAT'S A DECISION IS TAKEN THE U.K. WERE LOOSE OUT IN DEVELOPING TRADE LINKS WITH THE EMERGING MARKETS AND THAT MEANS LOSS OF JOBS RIGHT ACROSS THE UNITED ISN'T THAT THE PROBLEM DANIEL AND IF HE'S YOUR IDEA IS BORIS JOHNSON'S IDEA IT'S BORIS ISLAND THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN THE BIN AND EVEN IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT NO I'M NOT AT ALL I AGREE WHAT DO IT TREAT IT HAS BEEN PUT IN THE BIN BY THE DAVIES COMMISSIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S GREAT PITY BUT WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO SAY IT I AGREE WITH LOUISE THAT WE DO NEED
A PROPER AIRPORT FOR THIS COUNTRY IF WE'RE TO MAINTAIN THEIR JOBS AND THE CONNECTIVITY WOULD GO WITH THAT THE POINT IS THAT ANY EVERY ATTEMPT TO TRY AND EXPAND HEATHROW HAS FALLEN IN THE NEXT ONE WILL FALL AS WELL IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES SUGGEST OR PROPOSE THEY DO THIS IT WILL NOT GET THROUGH THE PROCESS IT WILL FAIL AGAIN IT'S TIME TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER SOLUTION A BORIS CAME UP WITH ONE AND
RIGHT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE LET'S HEAR ANOTHER THAT ACTUALLY WORKS BECAUSE THIS ONE IS NOT GOING TO WORK TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH
IT'S TIME FOR A DECISION A DECISION HAS TO BALANCE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS NO DECISION MEANS OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING TURKEY BUILDING ITS NEW AIRPORT FOR NEXT YEAR WILL GO AHEAD OF US AND WE WILL LOSE JOBS A BRIEF FINAL WORD ON ANOTHER SUBJECT IF I MAY THE CHIEF RABBI HAS WRITTEN TO THE TELEGRAPH STRAINED LABOUR'S POISON IS THE HEADLINE THE PAPER PUT ON IT NOW YOU'VE BEEN OUTSPOKEN ON THIS ISSUE YOU'RE OF COURSE A JEWISH MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT LABOUR M.P.
IS HE RIGHT ACHIEVER UP I'D TO SAY THAT THIS CAN'T BE DISMISSED AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM THEY CAN'T BE DISMISSED AS SOMEHOW STIRRING IT AGAINST MISTER CORBIN YES HE'S THE CHIEF RABBI IS QUITE RIGHT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM I THINK WE NEED A GREAT DEAL MORE EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT ANTI SCIMITARS AND HIS
CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF THIS ROAD IS ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE BUT WHEN THE WORLD'S ONLY JEWISH STATE IS DEMONISE TREATED IN THE WAY NO OTHER STATUS AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES THEY TALK ABOUT JEWISH POWER IN JEWISH COTTERILL INDEED THE PINT TO SINUS AND EXACTLY THE SAME UNTRUTHS THAT ARE APPLIED TO JEWS IN STRAIGHTFORWARD ANTI SEPARATISM WITH MOVING INTO ANTI SEMITIC TERRITORY AND THAT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD I DON'T THINK IT HAS ON THE STUFF AT THE MOMENT LOUISE WANT THANK YOU
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO NINE STANLEY SPENCER WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTISTS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WHICH IS WHY THERE IS GREAT EXCITEMENT AT A SKETCH BOOK OF HIS THAT'S BEEN FOUND BY HIS FAMILY
IT CONTAINS THE EARLIEST KNOWN EXAMPLES OF HIS WORK FROM NINETEEN OH SEVEN WHEN HE WAS JUST FIFTEEN IT'LL NOW BE PART OF AN EXHIBITION OF HIS WORK AT THE HEPWORTH WAKEFIELD ART GALLERY WAKEFIELD IN YORKSHIRE AND WE ARE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY THE CURATOR OF THAT EXHIBITION AT THE HEPWORTH WAKEFIELD ELEANOR CLAYTON AND BY STANDS SUNNY SPENCER'S GRANDSON JOHN SPENCER
WHO FOUND THE BOOK GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH WANT TO YOU'VE GOT THE BOOK WITH YOU AND WE'LL COME TO IN A MOMENT BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST STOP WITH THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STANLEY SPENCER HIMSELF ELEANOR CLAYTON FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT SO FAMILIAR WITH WITH HIM I MEAN HE WAS AN ENORMOUS INFLUENTIAL FIGURE ABSOLUTELY AND HIS HIS WORK BUT HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST PAINTERS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW HIS WORK FROM HIS PAINTINGS RELATED TO THE WAR SO SANDHAM MEMORIAL CHAPEL WHICH IS NOW RUN BY THE NATIONAL TRUST
THAT SHOWED CYCLE OF HIS WAR FIRST WORLD WAR EXPERIENCES IN PAINT AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF US NATIONAL TREASURES FOR SOME YEARS AND HE WAS ALSO KNOWN FOR HIS WORK DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR BUT ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY EXPANSIVE CAREER THROUGHOUT THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND OF COURSE WE HAD RELIGIOUS PAINTINGS IN COOKHAM IN BERKSHIRE WHERE HE WAS FROM ABSOLUTELY SO THESE WHAT HE CALLED HIS FIGURE PAINTINGS THESE VERY IMAGINATIVE PAINTINGS OF SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS SETTING KIRKHAM
THAT SEEMED VERY VISIONARY ALONGSIDE BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS AS WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAINTINGS THAT NOWADAYS WOULD COLLECT MANY MILLIONS OF POUNDS SO JOHN SPENCER YOU ARE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH HIS THINGS ANY WRITING AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF IT A THAT A BIOGRAPHY OF HIM WORKING ON HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THEN
WHAT HAPPENS HOW DID YOU FIND THIS WELL IT'S SOMETHING WHICH HAS ALWAYS HAD AN EYE FOR ME HOW DOES THAT SEEM SILLY BUT UNLESS SOMEBODY WANTS TO YEAH
EXHIBITED IT WHICH ELEANOR WHEN WE SHOWED IT TO HER EARLIER THIS YEAR I THOUGHT I MUST THERE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW IT IN THE EXHIBITION TO PUT IT INTO WHAT YOU'VE WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY MY MOTHER AND MY AUNT
HE WAS STILL WITH US HAVE YOU NO WHAT SORT OF ADULT THING YES THEY'VE JUST HAD IT AND IT'S BEEN SORT OF KEPT IN IN THERE IN AN ARCHIVE FOR SAFEKEEPING WHEN SPENCER DIED HE LEFT A HUGE AMOUNT OF EPHEMERA I THINK THE AMOUNT OF PAPERS AND BOOKS AND NOTEBOOKS CAN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED SO ACTUALLY TO GO THROUGH IT ALL WOULD BE ALMOST SUPERHUMAN WHICH IS WHAT JOHN HAS BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST I TRY AND GO HE'S TOGETHER THIS SORT OF WE WERE GOING THROUGH VOLUME ONE
WRITE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY AT THE MOMENT AND THERE'S A STORY IN THIS IN THE CATALOGUE
WITH THIS WOULDN'T TELL US ABOUT THAT BOOK AND WHAT IS IN IT AND WHAT IT SHOWS THERE ARE SKETCHES I MEAN ELEANOR MAYBE BETTER ON SOME OF IT THERE CUT IT WAS JUST AS HE WENT TO MAIDENHEAD TECHNICAL SCHOOL SO HE'S NOT A TRAINED ARTIST
AND ONE OR TWO OF THEM ARE STILL JUST A LITTLE LANDSCAPE TO THE RANN COOK UM AND I CAN ACTUALLY RECOGNISE WHERE THEY ARE ACCURATE LITTLE PEN AND INK DRAWINGS AND THEN THERE ARE SOME VERY UNUSUAL QUITE AND SOME QUITE SURREAL ALMOST FAIRY TALE
THE STORY HE WRITES IS ALMOST GRIMM'S FAIRY TALE ABSOLUTELY I WAS DELIGHTED WHEN I SAW IT I MEAN DO YOU HAVE ANSWER TO MENTION IT CASUALLY BUT ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S A FASCINATING OBJECT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THESE TWO THINGS THAT SPENCE WOULD GO ON TO MAKE HIS KEY STRANDS IN HIS PRACTICE WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT REALLY THEY HAVE THESE VISIONARY IMAGINATIVE REALLY FANTASTICAL PAINTINGS AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE VERY DETAILED
DEPICTIONS OF LANDSCAPES AROUND COCONUT WHICH ACTUALLY LATER ON HE HE WOULD NOT LIKE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD TO MAKE THEM FOR MONEY HE WAS SO FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT ON THEM BUT ACTUALLY THAT YOU SEE HERE IN HIS EARLY VERY VERY FIRST WORKS I KIND OF DELIGHTS IN SHOWING THE DETAILS OF THE TREES IN THE LEAVES IN THE LANDSCAPES THAT HE GREW UP IN AND HOW INSPIRING THAT WAS FOR HIM AND HE'S VERY HEAVY THOUGH
JOHN SPENCE EFFORT FOR YOU TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHO HE WAS AND SOMEBODY FAMILY MEMBER DID TO DOES IT ADD SOMETHING FOR YOU WELL I'M READING THROUGH ALL OF HIS WRITING AT THE MOMENT AND WE'RE CONCENTRATING ON HIS EARLY
LIFE SO HIS LETTERS HOME FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND I'M JUST DISCOVERING
ABOUT SOMEBODY NO ONE'S READ THEM IN THE DETAIL OR HARDLY ANYONE AS WITH THEM IN THE DETAIL I AM AND WE'RE HOPING TO PUBLISH THE FIRST VOLUME LATER THIS YEAR BUT IS IT ALSO MAKE YOU LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY AS HIM OF PERHAPS GOING TO ELEANOR'S WHAT ABOUT THIS WHAT ABOUT THIS WELL I THOUGHT I BOTHER LOTS OF THE TEAM WORKING WITH FOR THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I FIND
AND I'M DISCOVERING THAT HE'S NOT THE PERSON I KNEW WHO WAS AT SEA AND WE'RE INCLUDING A LOT OF HIS WRITING IN HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS PAIN OF HIS PAINTINGS IN THE EXHIBITION AS WELL BECAUSE I REALLY THINK IT DOES SHOW THE REAL SPENCER IT GIVES A REAL INSIGHT INTO HIS WORK THAT THERE IS THE STORIES WELL ELEANOR
