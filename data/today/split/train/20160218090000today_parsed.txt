IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSEIN IN LONDON AND SARAH MONTAGUE HERE IN BRUSSELS WHERE LATER TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MEETING ALL TWENTY SEVEN OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TRY TO THRASH OUT THE FINAL DETAILS OF BRITAIN'S NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE IT'S A MEETING THAT COULD DETERMINE WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS IN
OR LEAVES THE E.U. THE OTHER HEADLINES THIS MORNING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TO MAKE A HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS INSPECTORS SAY SOME POLICE OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES SPEND AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT ALSO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL GOES MISSING FROM A PRIVATE AMERICAN STORAGE FACILITY IN IRAQ

ANYONE WHO CAN MAKE A GOOD CUP OF TEA
LIKE TAKING BREAD TO THE TOP
WHY HAVE WE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE WITH THAT BRITISH CLASSIC TEA AND TOAST THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLARKSTON DAVID CAMERON'S ATTEMPT TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS REACHING A CLIMAX AS LEADERS OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS MADE FOR A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
THE U.K.'S DEMANDS WILL TOP THE AGENDA OF THE FIRST SESSION OF THE TWO DAY GATHERING WHICH WILL ALSO DISCUSSED THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK HAS WARNED THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
ANYTHING FROM PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE MEANING OF THE TERM EVER CLOSER UNION COULD PROVOKE LENGTHY DEBATE
THE U.K. DEMAND FOR A CAST IRON GUARANTEE THAT THE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED BY DAVID CAMERON WILL EVENTUALLY BE ENSHRINED IN THE E.U. TREATIES IS ONE OF MANY DIFFICULT LEGAL OBSTACLES IN ADDITION MANY COUNTRIES REMAIN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO ANY SUGGESTION THAT CHANGES TO WELFARE PAYMENTS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE U.K. IN MIND COULD BE ADOPTED BY OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THE FUTURE
SO THERE IS PLENTY THAT COULD STILL GO WRONG BUT THERE'S ALSO A FEELING THAT FURTHER DELAY WON'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER TO REACH A DEAL THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE AN HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS MARKING A TURNING POINT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF HOSTILITY WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS WILL ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT MISTER OBAMA WILL TRAVEL TO HAVANA AS PART OF A WIDER TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
THE SPEED WITH WHICH THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS THAWED HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF BREATHTAKING IT WAS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO THAT PRESIDENTS A BARBER AND RAUL CASTRO SAID THEY WANTED TO PUT THE HOSTILITY OF THE COLD WAR BEHIND THEM LAST SUMMER THEY RESPECTED EMBASSIES REOPENED IN WASHINGTON AND HAVANA AND EARLIER THIS WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF THERE BEING THE OCCASIONAL CHARTER FLYING INTO CUBA FROM THE U.S. COMMERCIAL AVIATION WOULD RESUME WITH ONE HUNDRED TEN FLIGHTS A DAY FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND
THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE RELATIONS ARE COMPLETELY NORMALISED THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY WHO THINK THE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE TOO FAR TOO QUICKLY
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS CONDEMNED THE CARR BOMBING IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA THAT KILLED AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE AND WOUNDED MORE THAN SIXTY OTHERS ARE WHITE EYE STATEMENT SAID THE UNITED STATES WOULD STAND WITH TURKEY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE MILITANT GROUP NO GRIP HER SAID IT CARRIED OUT THE BOMBING
AN INSPECTION REPORT HAS WARNED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES IS AT RISK BECAUSE SOME OFFICERS ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS REFORMED POLICING TO MAKE IT MORE PROFESSIONAL AND LESS BUREAUCRATIC HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
ALTHOUGH THE INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY FOUND THAT POLICE WERE GOOD AT PREVENTING CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IT SAID THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF EIGHTEEN OF THE FORTY THREE FORCES WAS SUBSTANDARD IT WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING WAS BEING ERODED AS BEAT OFFICERS SPENT FEWER HOURS ON PATROL AND MORE TIME RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS GUARDING CRIME SCENES AND STAFFING FRONT COUNTERS
INSPECTOR SAID THERE WAS A RISK THE POLICE SERVICE WAS SLEEPWALKING TO A RETURN TO ITS OLD APPROACH WHERE OFFICERS WERE ISOLATED FROM COMMUNITIES
THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE TODAY ON THE CONTROVERSIAL COMMON LOT OF JOINT ENTERPRISE WHICH CAN RESULT IN SOMEONE BEING CONVICTED OF ASSAULT OR MURDER EVEN IF THE HARM WAS INFLICTED BY SOMEONE ELSE THEY WERE WITHE CAMPAIGNERS CLAIM THAT AROUND SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE SERVING SENTENCES AS A RESULT OF WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE UNJUST JOINT ENTERPRISE CONVICTIONS
A LEADING HEALTH THINK TANK SAYS N.H.S. TRUSTS IN ENGLAND ARE ON COURSE TO BE TWO POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS IN THE RED BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR THE KING'S FUND SAYS THE OVERSPEND IS GETTING WORSE AND PERFORMANCES DETERIORATING SHAPING UP TO BE A MAKE OR BREAK YEAR FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE

PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR N.H.S. HOSPITALS OVERSPENT BY ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION HALFWAY THROUGH THIS YEAR HIGH LAST SEPTEMBER THEY'D OVERSPENT BY ONE POINT SIX BILLION IT NOW LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL BE OVERSPENDING BY TWO POINT THREE OR MORE MILLION THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE

WEATHER CENTRE MORNING STUFF GOOD MORNING TO YOU MICHELLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TODAY'S SHAPING UP TO BE MAINLY DRY FINE DAY LOTS OF SUNSHINE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY BUT WITH A FEW SHOWERS AFFECTING WESTERN SCOTLAND PRIMARILY WHERE SOME COULD BE HEAVY WITH HAIL AND THUNDER TOMORROW THOSE LOOKING WETTER AND WINDIER BUT MILDER AND IT'S SET TO REMAIN PRETTY UNSETTLED INTO THE WEEKEND
TODAY STARTING WITH ENGLAND IT'S COLD AND FROSTY ACROSS NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS WITH A RISK OF ICE IN PLACES ON UNTREATED SURFACES BUT LESS COLD TO START FOR EASTERN AND SOUTH EASTERN PART IT WOULD RAIN AND HILL SNOW CONTINUE TO EASE AWAY FROM EAST ANGLIA I'M FROM KENT
FOR MOST OF ENGLAND WE'RE LOOKING A LARGELY DRY DAY WITH SUNNY SPELLS SOUTHWEST ENGLAND NORTHWEST ENGLAND WILL SEE IF YOU SCATTERED SHOWERS AT TIMES PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST AND A LITTLE MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUD HERE TO BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING MOST DRY A CHILLY DAY BUT PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND FIVE TO NINE CELSIUS
FOR WALES IT'S A DRY COLD AND FROSTY START WITH A RISK OF ICE AND ENTREATED SERVICES BUT AT LEAST HE'LL BE SUNNY THIS MORNING AND REMAIN LARGELY DRY INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH SUNNY SPELLS BUT CLOUD WILL BUILD ACROSS WESTERN PARTS THAT PERHAPS THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER AROUND ANOTHER CHILLY DAY WITH TEMPERATURES OF SIX OR SEVEN CELSIUS
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND FOR SCOTLAND IT'S A COLD FROSTY START WITH SOME ICY PATCHES AROUND FIRST THING BUT MAINLY DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE HOWEVER WESTERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHWEST NORTHERN IRON WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY AND SOME COULD BE HEAVY AND THE CHANCE OF HAIL AND THUNDER MIXED IN AND SNOW OVER THE HIGHER GROUND ARE CALLED AIN'T STILL WITH HIGHS OF FIVE TO SEVEN CELSIUS
TOMORROW IT'S A COLD DRY SUNNY FROSTY START ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM BEFORE CLOUD AND RAIN SPREADS EASTWARDS ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY DURING THE DAY WITH STRENGTHENING SOUTH WESTERLY WINDS THAT'S YOUR FORECAST STAB THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT EUROPEAN SUMMIT OF DAVID CAMERON'S TIME AS PRIME MINISTER IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS A STONE'S THROW FROM THE STUDIO AND BRUSSELS HE HOPES TO STRIKE A DEAL THAT WILL PERSUADE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THEY'RE PLANNING ON WHAT THEY'RE CALLING AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST MEETING TOMORROW BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXPECT TO REACH THAT DEAL TONIGHT
THE PRIME MINISTER FIRST MADE HIS CLEAR HIS INTENTIONS THREE YEARS AGO ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JANUARY TWENTY THIRTEEN WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE BLOOMBERG SPEECH HE CALLED FOR A DEEP REFORM OF E.U. INSTITUTIONS A RENEWED FOCUS ON DELIVERING PROSPERITY ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND HE PROMISED A REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U.
I SAY TO OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS FRUSTRATED AS SOME OF THEM NO DOUBT BY BRITAIN'S ATTITUDE WORK WITH US ON THIS CONSIDER THE EXTRAORDINARY STEPS WHICH THE EUROZONE MEMBERS ARE TAKING TO KEEP THE EURO TOGETHER STEPS WHICH A YEAR AGO WOULD HAVE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME THAT THE STEPS WHICH WILL BE NEEDED TO MAKE BRITAIN AND OTHERS MORE COMFORTABLE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE INHERENTLY SO OUTLANDISH OR SO UNREASONABLE
AND JUST AS I BELIEVE THAT BRITAIN SHOULD WANT TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. SO THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD WANT US TO STAY
BECAUSE A EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT BRITAIN WITHOUT ONE OF EUROPE'S STRONGEST POWERS A COUNTRY WHICH IN MANY WAYS INVENTED THE SINGLE MARKET WHICH BRINGS REAL HEFTY EUROPE'S INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD STAGE WHICH PLAYS BY THE RULES WHICH IS A FORCE FOR LIBERAL ECONOMIC REFORM THAT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF EUROPEAN
OF COURSE IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A REFERENDUM ON WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS IN EUROPE BUT THE LAST ONE WAS FORTY YEARS AGO HE'S PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON ON THE SIXTH OF JUNE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ANNOUNCING THAT THE PEOPLE HAD VOTED TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY WHAT LATER BECAME THE E.U.
BEEN GIVEN BY HER BOOKS AND VIA MAJORITY BIGGER THAN THAT ACHIEVED BY ANY GIRL
IN ANY GENERAL ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR DEMOCRACY
NO ONE IN BRITAIN IN EUROPE OR THE WAY THE WORLD SHOULD HAVE ANY DOUBTS ABOUT IT
TO ME WAS THAT FOURTEEN YEARS OF NATIONAL ARGUMENT
IT MEANS THAT ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE HAD RESERVATIONS
ABOUT BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT SHE WAS NOW JOIN WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITHOUT SKIN
IN THE TASK OF OVERCOMING THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HAD SAILORS AS A NATION THANK THE PRIME MINISTER
WELL MOST DIPLOMATS HERE SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT AN AGREEMENT WILL BE DONE AT THIS SUMMIT ALTHOUGH PROBABLY LOOK NOT UNTIL TOMORROW AND THAT OF COURSE WOULD THEN PAVE THE WAY FOR A NEW REFERENDUM IN THE U.K. IN JUNE TAKING A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS THE GUARDIAN HAS IN AN EXCLUSIVE WHAT IT SAYS WHILE WE WERE PROMISED YESTERDAY THERE HAD BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT WE WOULD SEE THE FIRST OF THE NEXT THE NEW DRAFT
OF THE SETTLEMENT THAT HAD BEEN REACHED SO FAR IT WASN'T PUBLISHED BUT THE GUARDIAN CLAIMS THAT IT IS SEEN THAT LEAKED FILES AND THEY SUGGEST THAT THIS NEW DOCUMENT SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S STILL UNDECIDED WHETHER THIS DEAL WOULD MEAN A REFORMED TO ARE REVISING OF THE LISBON TREATY THAT WHATEVER
DAVID CAMERON HAD AGREED HERE WOULDN'T THEN BE SEALED IN A TREATY CHANGE AND IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES AND SOME AREAS ARE WIDENING RATHER THAN NARROWING WE'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE I JUST LET YOU KNOW IN THE EUROPEAN PAPERS
AND THE BELGIAN PAPER LA LIBRA SAYS THAT THERE ARE THREE OBSTACLES TO AVOID AT THE BRECK'S IT THAT'S ITS HEADLINE PAPER EVER ARTICLE INSIDE SUGGESTS THAT WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS MANAGED TO DO WITH THIS IS NEUTRALISE UKIP WHICH WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MOTIVATIONS OF HIS REFERENDUM PROMISE THE PUT FRENCH PAPER LE FIGARO SAYS IT IS BRECK'S IT TO THE DECISIVE EUROPEAN SUMMIT FOR DAVID CAMERON THE TELEGRAPH EUROPE DEAL OR NO DEAL
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING TO HEAR JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHETHER THIS DEAL CAN BE SECURED BUT ALL THE PAPERS ALSO PICK UP ON NEW FIGURES FOR E.U. MIGRANTS THE NUMBER WORKING BRITAIN SURGED BEYOND TWO MILLION WHICH IS PUT PRESSURE ON THE PRIME MINISTER
THE MAIN STORY FOR THE INDEPENDENT OF THIS MORNING IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS GAP IT IS LOOKING AT FIGURES THAT HAVE COME OUT FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION STATISTICS AGENCY WHICH SHOWS THAT THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS FROM POOR BACKGROUNDS GOING TO THE U.K.'S LEADING UNIVERSITIES HAS FALLEN IN THE PAST DECADE DESPITE MILLIONS OF POUNDS BEING SPENT ENCOURAGING THOSE STUDENTS TO APPLY IT'S A SEVEN OUT OF THE TWENTY FOUR UNIVERSITIES IN A MORE SELECTIVE RUSSELL GROUP OF UNIVERSITIES HAVE SEEN THE PERCENTAGE OF DEPRIVE PUPILS ADMIT
ALL THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THE FIGURES CAST A NEW LIGHT ON THE OFT REPEATED CLAIM BY MINISTERS AND UNIVERSITIES THAT ACCESS FOR TEENAGERS FROM DISADVANTAGED AREAS HAS IMPROVED SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF TUITION FEES IT SAYS WHILE MORE POOR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY THE NEW FIGURES INDICATE THAT MOST ARE WINNING PLACES AT MIDDLE AND LOW RANKED INSTITUTIONS NOT THE MOST SELECTIVE AND ONE NON EUROPE RELATED STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN AT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND ITS OWN FORECAST
CHURCH ATTENDANCE OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS IT IS GOING TO FALL THAT'S BEEN CONFIRMED BY JOHN SPENCER CHURCH OF ENGLAND'S FINANCE CHIEF HE SAID THAT THE FIGURES OF EIGHTEEN PEOPLE PER ONE THOUSAND TO REGULARLY ATTEND CHURCH AT THE MOMENT ARE LIKELY TO FALL TO TEN PER ONE THOUSAND AT AN EIGHTY ONE YEAR OLD WAS EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ATTEND CHURCH THAN A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD
TIMES NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX POLICE OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE BEING TUCKED AWAY RATHER THAN BEING OUT ON THE BEAT SO SAYS A REPORT FROM HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY DANNY SURE OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE IS THIS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES
THIS IS A PRETTY MUCH ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES MICHELLE IT'S A REPORT ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICE AND IT FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH POLICE FORCES ARE GOOD AT PREVENTING CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR EIGHTEEN OF THE FORTY THREE FORCES THAT'S ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THE FORCES
WAS SUBSTANDARD AND REQUIRED IMPROVEMENT AND THERE WAS PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING HER BECAUSE THAT IS AN AREA THAT ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY BUDGET CUTS THE LOSS OF POLICE COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT LOCAL
NEIGHBOURHOOD TEAMS ARE NOW BEING USED FOR OTHER DUTIES SUCH AS MANNING THE FRONT COUNTERS PROCESSING SUSPECTS WHO ARE ARRESTED AND RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES RATHER THAN DOING THE BEECH WORK OUT ON THE STREETS PATROLLING THE STREETS LIAISING INTERACTED WITH LOOK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THE CRIME PREVENTION WORK
THE EYES AND EARS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE NOT DOING SO MUCH OF THAT WORK ANY MORE AND WITH THE POLICE FORCES SAY THAT THOSE CHOICES ARE AN INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE THESE CUTS AND THERE ARE FEWER OFFICERS TO GO ROUND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE POLICE FORCES WOULD SAY PREDOMINANTLY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE INSPECTED A CONSTABULARY BELIEVES IT SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT AN INEVITABLE RESULT OF BUDGET CUTS THAT DESPITE THE FACT FORTY THOUSAND POSTS HAVE GONE IT SINCE TWENTY TEN THEY SAY IT'S AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT
AND IF POLICE RESHAPE THEIR FORCES PROPERLY THEY CAN STILL MAINTAIN GOOD NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING ZOE BILLINGHAM WHO'S THE INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY WHO WROTE THIS REPORT SAID THERE IS A DANGER THAT IF POLICE LEADERS DON'T GET TO GRIPS WITH THIS PROBLEM THAT THE SERVICE WILL SLEEPWALK
BACK TO A TIME WHEN IT MERELY JUST REACTED TO EVENTS RATHER THAN TOOK PROACTIVE STEPS AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS ISOLATED FROM COMMUNITIES WHIZZING AROUND IN PANDA CARS AND SO ON SO THIS IS THIS IS A REPORT THAT REALLY SETS THE ALARM BELLS RINGING FOR THE POLICE SERVICE THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IS AT RISK WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO ZOE BILLINGHAM AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND TO ESSEX POLICE AT THE SAME TIME DANNY SURE THANK YOU
IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW HOW MUCH IMPORTANT BY THE CITY OF LONDON BE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE HERE IN BRUSSELS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS TANYA BECKETT CAN TELL US MORNING TANYA GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN WILL CITY OF LONDON COURSE BELIEVES ITSELF TO BE VERY IMPORTANT SERRA PROTECTIONS FOR THE U.K. AND EUROPE'S FINANCIAL HUB COULD BE ONE OF THE KEY STICKING POINTS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE ARE KEEN TO PROTECT THE CITY AGAINST INCREASED FINANCIAL REGULATION FROM BRUSSELS WHILST PRESERVING ACCESS
TO THE SINGLE CURRENCY BLOC THOSE ON THE LEAVES SIDE SITE BONUS CAPS FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAXES AND MOVES TOWARDS AN E. YOU BANKING UNION AS REASONS TO GET OUT WAS THOSE WHO WANT TO RETAIN THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP SUGGEST A BRECK SIT
COULD LEAD TO FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS AND THOUSANDS ARE BEST OFF LEAVING FOR PARIS OR FRANKFURT FOR SOME THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT OF WHETHER WE STAY OR GO IT'S GETTING SOMEWHAT TIRESOME HERE'S ONE OF THE U.K.'S MOST INFLUENTIAL FUND MANAGERS NEIL WOODFORD
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT IS A BOGUS ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT CREDIBILITY IN AN ARGUMENT TO STAY OR TO LEAVE CONSTRUCTED AROUND ECONOMICS I THINK IT'S A NAIL SOME GAME FRANKLY IF WE STAY OR WE LEAVE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE RELATIVELY
INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE HE DOESN'T SEEM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT MANY ARTS HAVE US A VERY IS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT OSCAR FUND WHICH IS A LONDON BASED HEDGE FUND AND SUB US YOUR PERSPECTIVE REALLY IS THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD LEAVE
THE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT LEAVING
UNDER AN ISOLATION IS GENEROUS WRONG LEAVING WHAT'S AN ISOLATIONIST AT THEY'D THE YOU COULD BEGIN A WHEREBY WE JUST RAZOR DRAWBRIDGES AND WE TURN OUR BACK ON EUROPE WELL IF WE DID LEAVE WHAT SHOULD BE A PROMISE THEY SHOULD BE TO RETURN TO WHAT WE JOINED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH THE COMMON ECONOMIC YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE Y. YOU RETAINED PURELY AS A TRADE BLOCK AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
IT HAS ENGAGED IN RECENT MISSION CREEP OVER RECENT DECADES IT'S MOVED INTO HER IS THAT REALLY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT
IN THE HANDS OF SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE JUDICIAL REASON AREAS OF PENAL CODE TRADITIONAL ISSUES THAT THIS COUNTRY THE U.K. IS AS PERFECTLY GOOD
STRUCTURES IN PLACE FOR BANKING REGULATION THE M.P.C. IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE C.B.E. CURRENCY HAS BEEN REMARKABLY GOOD AT CALIBRATING THE ECONOMY DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT THE GREEKS WHICH THEY COULD DO WITH THEIR OWN CURRENCY AT THE HEAD
BUT I HAVE THE FIRST OF ALL LET'S TALK ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO ONCE A SINGLE CURRENCY RESIDE WITH IN THE TRADE BLOCK IT IS NOT POSSIBLE SURELY TO SIMPLY CALL IT A TRADE BLOCK BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE A SINGLE CURRENCY THEN YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY WHETHER OR NOT THE U.K. IS OR IS NOT WITHIN THAT CURRENCY BLOC WITH THE E.U. HAS CUSTOMERS UNIONS IT HAS DEEP AND EXTENSIVE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTRIES WHO ENTERED FROM CANADA TO THE UKRAINE AND TURKEY NONE OF WHICH
SHARE A COMMON CURRENCY SO SUITS AT HAVING HAVING SEPARATE CURRENCIES IS IS NOT THE ISSUE IT'S NOT HAVING RESTRICTIONS IN THE FLOW OF GOODS AND SERVICES AND LABOUR AND CAPITAL AND THAT'S WHAT THEY USE THE C. WAS CREATED TO TO TO DO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IT'S GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN THE FACT THAT HE SITS ON THE G.SEVEN ALONGSIDE GREAT BRITAIN
FRANCE ITALY AND GERMANY IT WHAT IS THE IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST TRADING A FINANCIAL CENTRES WITHIN THE EUROZONE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT WITHIN THE EUROZONE TRADE'S VERY MUCH IN THE EURO EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T EXIST WITHIN THE TRADE IN ITALY CURRENCY BLOC LET'S LET'S HEAR FROM MARK BAILEY AT HIS POLICY CHAIRMAN AT THE CITY OF LONDON CORPORATION HE DOESN'T LIKE THE UNCERTAINTY
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE REST OF YOU WOULD BE WE WOULD HAVE A PERIOD OF SOME YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY AND IN UNCERTAINTY THEN YOU WOULD GET LESS INVESTMENT PEOPLE BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE DECISIONS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S GOING TO RUSH TO LEAVE
BUT BUSINESSES WOULD THEN SAY RIGHT WE NOW KNOW BRITAIN WILL NOT BE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT SCENARIOS WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY SO THAT'S THE THE TRUTH IS IT WOULD BE A VERY UNCERTAIN OUTCOME WOULD IT NOT
YESTERDAY WE HAD FIGURES SHOWING THE LOAD MARKET U.K. IS STRENGTHENING PEGGY SPECIE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE MAINTAINING A PRESENCE IN LONDON AT THERE WAS TALK OF THE MOVING SOME JOBS TO PARIS CUT TO MAKE THE POINT
THROUGH THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR THIRTY THOUSAND FRENCH NATIONALS TOOK UP U.K. NATIONAL CHURCH NUMBERS THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS INTO THE U.K. THE U.K. IS THE POSTER ECONOMY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND YOU'VE BEEN UNION IS NOT THIS AND FUR HEALTHY ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL THE BLOCK THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO PUT MY TENT IS GEORGE COPPER IS ALSO WITH US IN THE STUDIO HE'S FROM MANAGER MIGHT AND GREAT ARE YOU CONCERNED GEORGE ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT OF BRECK'S IT MIGHT CREATE
UNCERTAINTY IS ALREADY EXISTING WE'VE SEEN THAT WE LISTEN IN STIRLING IN SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE THE SECTOR'S I THINK IT'S FROM MY PAPA RESPECTABLE IN A WEEK WE WOULDN'T TRY AND SPECULATE WE KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WE USE THE UNCERTAINTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT IT CAN IT CAN PRESENT YES THEY'LL BE UNCERTAINTY BUT I STUFF THE WORLD WILL KEEP SPINNING
AND I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY A POT THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT IS THAT THE EXTREME SIDE OF A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR THAT BE THE UKIP OR THAT HE EY YOU BEING A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY JUST AAARGH DON'T WHOLE TREE AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT CREATES UNCERTAINTY RATHER THAN THE THE DEBATE ITSELF GEORGE STAY WITH US COS WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU IN A MOMENT ON MORE ON THE MARKETS BUT FINALLY SAID
WE ARE WITHIN A TRADING BLOCK WE LOSE THAT RIGHT OF THAT IS THE KEY ADVANTAGE WE WOULD LOSE IT IF WE LEFT THE E.U. AND ARGUABLY IT WOULD INCREASE THE DISPARITY THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY WITHIN REGIONS WITHIN THE U.K. BECAUSE THOSE THAT ARE NOT TRADING SO MUCH WITH THE E.U. WOULD BENEFIT THOSE THAT ART WOULD NOT THAT HAS PLINY UNTRUE THE E.U. HAS CUSTOMS UNIONS WITH COUNTRIES RANGING FROM MOLDOVA
TO CANADA IT MAY BE THE CASE AND THE MORTIE CARCASSONNE AND AT THE GATE AT THE THE IDEA THAT THEY WILL PENALISE US BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN NOT ENOUGH TO LEAVE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT ISLAND WOULD SUFFERING AS A CONSUMMATE GLAD TO MAKE ONE POINT THE LAST TIME WE LEFT SOMETHING EUROPEAN WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE LEFT THE R.A.F.
POUND FOR YOUR EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM AND IT SERVE DUST REMARKABLY WELL O.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GEORGE IS WITH US AS I SAID HERE IN THE STUDIO LET'S JUST GO BACK TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHICH IS CREATING OR IT'S PART OF A LOT OF MARKET UNCERTAINTY WE HEARD FROM THE FAT RESERVE THE CENTRAL BANK IN THE U.S. YESTERDAY BUT A BIT MORE CLARITY ON HOW IT'S THINKING
WOULDN'T WE ALL LIKE THAT I THINK THE PROBLEM WE ARE SEEING A SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF A FLIP FLOP APPROACH TO THE MOVE TO RAISE RATES DISCUSSION ALREADY HAPPENING AS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL CUT RATES AND THE LITTLE BE THE SHORT SHORTENING GREAT CYCLE WE'VE EVER SEEN I THINK MORE GENERALLY WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS HIS UNCERTAINTY AMONG INVESTORS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CENTRAL BANKS ARE LOSING THEIR POWER TO CONTROL
MARKETS WE'VE SEEN THE REACTION ON TO JAPAN WHERE THEY'VE MOVED TO NEGATIVE RATES IT'S HAVING VERY DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ALL ON CONFIDENCE AND THINK OF A MORE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL THAT IS A CONCERN AMONG INVESTORS THAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE STARTING TO LOSE THEIR GRIP AND THEIR CONTROLLER MARKET AND TALKING ABOUT MARKETS WE HAVE OF COURSE SEEN ENERGY PRICES FALLING CENTRICA IS REPORTING SHORTLY
BECAUSE THE OWNER OF BRITISH GAS IN THE U.K. THEY'RE ALSO ONE OF THE TEN FOOT SWIMMING TO COMPANIES THAT CUT THEIR DIVIDEND LAST YEAR THAT'S BECAUSE OF US OUR HIGH DEPOSITION AND A POOR CASH FLOW WITHIN THE COMPANY SO ALL EYES WILL BE FOCUSED ON THAT A LOT OF TRADITIONAL INVESTORS MIGHT OWN UTILITY SHARES BECAUSE THEY'RE PERCEIVED SAFE DIVIDEND THAT WAS KNOCKS LAST YEAR AND THAT'LL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE SPOKE AS THE SMALLEST BRITAIN'S LARGEST UTILITY I SHOULD HAVE SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GEORGE WELL
WESTERN ECONOMIES ARE SET FOR MANY DECADES OF SLOW TO NO PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH BECAUSE WE HADN'T ENJOYED THE FRUITS OF ANY GAME CHANGING INDUSTRIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTIONS FOR GENERATIONS THIS IS THE CEASELESS THESIS EVEN PUT FORWARD BY U.S. ECONOMIST ROBERT GORDON IN HIS BOOK THE RISE AND FALL OF AMERICAN GROWTH
HE SUGGESTS THE BENEFITS OF NEW INVENTIONS LIKE ELECTRIC LIGHTS RAILWAYS CARS PLANES AND FRIDGES SPREAD RAPIDLY AND BENEFITED ALMOST EVERYONE BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR FIFTY YEARS SO WHY DOESN'T HE COUNTIN COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET
WE HAD A THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT WE CALL THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IT REALLY AND THE WHOLE LAST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WE HAD THE FIRST MAINFRAME COMPUTERS AROUND NINETEEN FIFTY NINETEEN SIXTY AND THEN WE HAD THE MOVEMENT TO THE PERSONAL COMPUTER SPREADSHEETS
WORD PROCESSING PROGRAMS AND THEN THE MAYOR ITSELF WHICH WAS DEVELOPED A STARTING AROUND THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES WE DID GET A SLOWING OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTY AND THEN A BRIEF REVIVAL THAT HAPPENED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THE SO CALLED DARK CALM DECADE
WE HAD A A CHANGE IN THE WAY BUSINESS WAS CARRIED OUT OFFICERS MOVING FROM TYPEWRITERS PAPER AND FILE CABINETS THROUGH DE WORD PROCESSING AND SPREADSHEETS THROUGH TO THE FLAT SCREEN AND SEARCH ENGINES AND YOU KARMA
BUT THAT WAS VERY MUCH CONCENTRATED IN THEIR DIVE CAN'T DECADE AND DISAPPOINTINGLY THE PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TAILED OFF AND HAVE MORE OR LESS GONE AWAY PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN BARELY ONE PER CENT
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE NEXT COMING DECADES ARE WE GOING TO UNLESS WE INVENT SOMETHING MASSIVE PRETTY QUICKLY ARE WE GOING TO SEE VERY LOW GROWTH WE'RE GOING TO SEE GROWTH IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS OR ARE LOOKING BACK MORE BROADLY AT THE ENTIRE PERIOD SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EXCLUDING THAT DAD CLIMB DECADE OF THE LATE NINETIES HAD PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
A LITTLE BETTER THAN ONE PER CENT A YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ARE ROUGHLY THE SAME I'M NOT SAYING THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH THAT'S GOING AWAY THE REAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND TO SOME EXTENT IN ECONOMIES IN BRITAIN IN WESTERN EUROPE IS NOT JUST THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH WILL BE SLOW COMPARED TO THE
EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BUT THAT WE FACE SOME HEADWINDS THERE ARE SLOWING GROWTH IN THE INCOME THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY OBTAINED BELOW THAT OF PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND WHEN WE JUST GIVE YOU THE TWO MAIN REASONS FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE THE DEMOGRAPHIC AGEING OF THE POPULATION
WHEN A PERSON RETIRES HE OR SHE MOVES FROM WORK AT WORK TO RETIREMENT AND THAT REDUCES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS OF WORK IN THE GIVEN POPULATION SO THAT MEANS THAT HOURS PER PERSON ARE SHRINKING AND THAT IN TURN MEANS THAT THE GROWTH RATE IN OUTPUT PER PERSON IS GOING TO BE SLOWER THAN OUTPUT PER HOUR WHICH IS PRODUCTIVITY
SO STARTING WITH THE ESTIMATE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF ABOUT ONE POINT TWO PERCENT FOR HELP A PROWLER I MARK THAT DOWN TO ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR OUTPUT PER PERSON DUDE OF THE AGEING OF THE POPULATION THEN WE HAVE THE LONG TERM CONTINUATION OF RISING INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
HALF OR MORE OF TOTAL INCOME GROWTH HAS GONE TO THE TOP ONE PER CENT OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION LEAVING THE REMAINING HAVE TO BE DIVIDED UP AMONG THE BOTTOM NINETY NINE PER CENT AND THAT IF WE CRAIG THROUGH THE FIGURES HER SUBTRACTED OR OFF ABOUT
ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT FROM THE GROSS IN OUTPUT PER PERSON SO THE MEDIAN THE PERSON IN THE MIDDLE IS GOING TO SEE OUTPUT PER PERSON ROLE WOULD ONLY ABOUT ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT WE'RE ALMOST BACK TO THE WORLD OF BRITAIN BEFORE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

TRUSTS IN ENGLAND ARE ON COURSE TO BE TWO POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS IN THE RED BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH THINK TANK THE KING'S FUND IT SAYS THE OVERSPEND IS GETTING WORSE AND PERFORMANCES DETERIORATING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS THAT DESPITE BEING VERY BUSY THE N.H.S. IS PERFORMING WELL
A SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT RAIL PASSENGERS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND FROM IN THE LEAST SATISFIED AND BRITAIN AFTER SPEAKING TO SEVEN THOUSAND TRAVELLERS THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH SAID THAT SOUTH EASTERN THAMES LINK UNDERBELLY OH GREATER ANGLIA WERE BOTTOM OF THE PILE GRAND CENTRAL WHICH OPERATES BETWEEN SUNDERLAND AND LONDON CAME TOP THE REAL DELIVERY GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS TRAIN OPERATORS AND NETWORK RAIL INSIST THAT OVERALL REAL PASSENGER SATISFACTION IS UP
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MEETINGS HERE IN BRUSSELS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO COULD DETERMINE WHETHER BRITAIN STAYS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR LEAVES IT IS A CRITICAL MOMENT MARGARET MORRIS IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT AND CHRIS TALK US THROUGH THEIR CHOREOGRAPHY WHO'S MEETING WHOM AND WHEN
BUT THE KEY MEETINGS FOR THE U.K. START LATE THIS AFTERNOON WHEN ALL E.U. LEADERS SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS THE U.K. ISSUE IN DETAIL FOR THE FIRST TIME AND EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS OF INTENSIVE NEGOTIATION PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS SINCE THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS DEAL WAS PUBLISHED
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ALL TWENTY EIGHT WILL SIT DOWN I THINK HE'S ONLY THEN WILL KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE LAWYERS IN THE TECHNOCRATS HAVE DONE ALL THEY CAN AND THERE ARE AREAS IN THE LATEST DRAFT IN SQUARE BRACKETS THAT MEANS THAT'S CODE THESE ARE THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND THAT'S WHAT THEIR LEADERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SORT OUT I'LL DO THAT
FOR A FEW HOURS THEN THEY'LL BREAK FOR DINNER OVER WHIPPED THEY'LL DISCUSS THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND THEN COME BACK TO THE U.K. ISSUE POSSIBLY WITH A SERIES OF BILATERAL MEETINGS GOING LATE INTO THE NIGHT BEFORE STARTING AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING OVER AS DESCRIBED BY ONE DIM DEPLOYED OVER BRUNCH OR POSSIBLY LUNCH TO TRY AND FINALISE A DEAL THAT STILL SEEMS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T GUARANTEED
AND OBVIOUSLY THE LONGER THINGS GO ON TOMORROW ON FRIDAY THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR DAVID CAMERON TO FIT IN A CABINET MEETING IN LONDON LATER IN THE DAY AND FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT THERE ARE STILL QUITE A FEW OF THESE SQUARE BACK BRACKETS AND IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND WITH DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
YES I'VE JUST HAD A QUICK LOOK THROUGH THE LATEST DRAFT WHICH WAS SENT TO MEMBER STATES IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHETHER IT BE ISSUES OVER WELFARE BENEFIT IN PARTICULARLY OVER CHILD BENEFIT WHETHER IT BE OVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE EURO ON FINANCIAL REGULATION IN PARTICULAR
WHETHER IT BE THE BRITISH DEMAND THAT THIS PROPOSED AGREEMENT HOW WHERE THERE'S A LEGAL GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROPOSED AGREEMENT WILL BE ENSHRINED IN THE E.U. TREATIES IN THE FUTURE
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE UP FOR GRABS AND AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR THE U.K. THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THE U.K. STILL WANTS TO STRENGTHEN THE TEXT ON THE WORDING AROUND THE CONCEPT OF EVER CLOSER UNION FOR EXAMPLE BUT THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES
FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ISSUE OF CHILD BENEFIT OTHER COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE HAD HOPED THAT THAT WOULD APPLY EXCLUSIVELY TO
PEOPLE IN BRITAIN BUT BUT I'M TOLD THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL AND OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE THE OPTION FOR APPLYING THE SAME RESTRICTIONS AND IF YOU'RE A COUNTRY LIKE ROMANIA FOR EXAMPLE WITH A MILLION CITIZENS IN ITALY AND A MILLION CITIZENS IN SPAIN THAT'S CERTAINLY A CAUSE FOR CONSIDERABLE CONCERN
IT'S SOMETHING WE SHALL RETURN TO THROUGHOUT OUT THE PROGRAMME FOR THE MOMENT CHRIS MORRIS THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S OUR TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE TODAY IN A CASE THAT COULD CHANGE THE WAY THE LAW OF JOINT ENTERPRISE WORKS IN ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND THE LAW'S BEEN USED TO CONVICT PEOPLE OF MURDER EVEN IF THEY DID NOT INFLICT THE FATAL BLOW CLIVE COLEMAN A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE AND THAT IS WHY IT'S BEEN CONTROVERSIAL AM CLYDE THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR CASE AT THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE LOOKING AT TODAY
THERE IS LET ME JUST NOT SCORE EXACTLY WHY IT IS CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE WHAT THE COURT IS LOOKING AT TODAY IS THE ROLE OF SO CALLED SECONDARY PARTIES SO IN OTHER WORDS THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN SOME FORM OF ENCOURAGING OR ASSISTING BUT DIDN'T INFECT FLICK THE FATAL BLOW MAY HAVE TAKEN NO PART IN ANY PLANNING AT THE MOMENT THEY CAN BE CONVICTED OF MURDER ON WHAT MANY REGARD AS A VERY LOW THRESHOLD AND THAT IS IF THE JURY FIND THAT THEY
COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT ANOTHER PERSON CONNECTED WITH THEM MIGHT EITHER KILL OR INFLICT SERIOUS HARM NOW AS I SAY THAT IS REGARDED BY MANY AS A TEST OF THE JUSTICE COMMITTEE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT IT AS HAVE SENIOR JUDGES LET ME GIVE YOU A VERY QUICK EXAMPLE OF HOW IT MIGHT WORK IN PRACTICE A GANG OF YOUTHS GO OUT EVERY EVENING TEN OF THEM
ONE IS KNOWN TO CARRY A KNIFE TROUBLE BREAKS OUT OUTSIDE A PUB IN A MATTER OF SECONDS THERE'S A FIGHT THEY'D CHEER ON THE MEMBER OF THEIR THEIR GANG WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT HE PULLS OUT A KNIFE AND HE KILLS THE VICTIM NOW SHOULD THE MEMBERS OF THE GANG WHO INSTANTANEOUSLY HEART ARE CHEERING ON THEIR FELLOW GANG MEMBER
SHOULD THEY BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER CONVICTED OF MURDER AND GIVEN A LIFE SENTENCE AND THAT IS WHAT THE COURT IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT TODAY AND GIVING JUDGEMENT IN IN RELATION TO ALTHOUGH THE TEST THE CASE THAT YOU REFER TO EVOKE TO PEOPLE ONE A MAN WHO WAS CALLED HE WAS OUTSIDE HER FLAT WHEN ANOTHER MAN WHO HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INFLICTED A MURDER BY STABBING THE VICTIM WHO WAS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER BUT HE WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN EGGING HIM ON
INDEED I MEAN THIS IS A CASE WHERE HE WAS LITERALLY JUST OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FLAT EARLIER IN THE EVENING THEY'D BEEN INSIDE THE FLOUTING JOCKEY HAD HAD PULLED OUT A KNIFE THREATENING TO SHANK OR STAB ANOTHER MAN NOT NOT THE EVENTUAL VICTIM SO AS YOU SAY HE WAS HE WAS OUTSIDE HE WAS EGGING THE PURSE NOT THEY'VE CHOSEN THIS CASE TO LOOK AT THIS THIS TEST THIS CONTENTIOUS TEST
THIS IS A TEST OF FORESIGHT NOT A TEST OF WHAT SOMEONE INTENDED AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THEY MAY WELL SAY SOMETHING GENERAL ABOUT THE STATE OF JOINT ENTERPRISE LAW AS IT RELATES TO SECONDARY PARTIES AND AS IT WOULD APPLY IN THE GANG SCENARIO THAT I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU WE WILL BE HEARING FROM A WIDOW OF PAUL PFEIFFER MURDER VICTIM IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE AT AT TEN TO EIGHT CLIVE COLEMAN THANK YOU
THE TIME'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF NORMALISING RELATIONS WITH CUBA PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TO TRAVEL TO HAVANA NEXT MONTH AS PART OF A TOUR OF LATIN AMERICA JOHN SO BLOOD NORTH AMERICA EDITOR HAS BEEN EXPLAINING HOW SIGNIFICANT A MOMENT THAT WOULD BE
HUGE YOU JUST THINK OF THE PAST HALF CENTURY OF MISTRUST YOU THINK OF THE COLD WAR HOSTILITY YOU THINK OF THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS YOU THINK OF THE FIASCO AT THE BAY OF PIGS YOU THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG AND THE KIND OF COLLECTIVE
THAT THERE IS BETWEEN AMERICA AND CUBA OVER ALL THIS TIME AND YET WHEN THE THAW HAS COME IN THE LAST FOURTEEN MONTHS OR SO HE'S COME INCREDIBLY QUICKLY AND YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE UNTHINKABLE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
COULD BE ON CUBAN SOIL AND NOW YOU THINK WELL YEAH THAT'S THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP BUT IT WILL NEVERTHELESS BE AN HISTORIC MOMENT BUT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE HE SAID HE'D ONLY GO TO CUBA IF HE WAS ABLE TO MEET CUBAN DISSIDENTS FOR EXAMPLE DO WE KNOW OF THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS AGENDA WHO HE'S GOING TO MEET WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO I WOULD THINK THEY'LL BE SOME KIND OF SYMBOLIC MOVEMENTS ALONG THOSE LINES
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE'S NOT HE'S GOING TO WANT TO CALIBRATE IT QUITE CAREFULLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE MAKES A GESTURE IN THAT DIRECTION AND A LOT OF CUBAN AMERICANS WHO WANT TO SEE THAT ALREADY MARCO RUBIO THE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL WHOSE FAMILY CAME FROM CUBA IS SAID IT'S TOO SOON THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN HAVANA WAS AN ANTI AMERICAN COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP THE TRAMPLED ON HUMAN RIGHTS THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO ARE VERY WARY ABOUT IT AT THE SAME TIME BARACK OBAMA WANT TO SHOW
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS ON A NEW FOOTING I THROUGH DIPLOMACY YOU CAN ENGAGE WITH OLD FOES AND MAKE PROGRESS AND ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP BEING ON A NEW FOOTING HOW MUCH IS ALREADY HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE NORMALISATION OF RELATIONS IT USED TO BE THE CASE WHEN I WENT THERE LAST YEAR YOU THERE WAS THE ODD CHARTER FLIGHT
THAT WENT IN TO HAVANA NOW AN AGREEMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED THIS WEEK WHICH WILL OPEN UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND TEN FLIGHTS A DAY FROM THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE STILL SANCTIONS IN PLACE
IF IF YOU WANTED TO GET ON A FLIGHT AND YOU'RE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN YOU HAVE TO STILL SAY I'M GOING THERE FOR A CULTURAL REASON FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS FOR PHILANTHROPIC REASONS YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I'M GETTING ON A PLATE COS I FANCY LYING ON THE BEACH FOR A WEEK IN THE CARIBBEAN IN CUBA
SO THERE ARE STILL BITS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN NORMALISED THAT GRADUALLY THANKING HAS RESUMED SO THE CUBAN COMPANIES CAN HOLD ACCOUNTS AND BOTH SIDES ARE LOOKING AT ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL COME WHEN HE EVENTUALLY THAT RELATIONSHIP IS NORMALISED JOHN OPAL THANK YOU
THE TIME'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS EUROPE TO DEAL OR NO DEAL IS THE QUESTION POSED ON THE FRONT OF THE TELEGRAPH AS THE PAPERS CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS WHICH AWAIT DAVID CAMERON IN BRUSSELS HERE IN BRUSSELS THE TELEGRAPH UNDERSTANDS THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGLER MERKEL AS ANGERED LEADERS IN EASTERN EUROPE BY INDICATING THAT SHE TOO WANTS ACCESS TO A SCHEME NEGOTIATED BY MISTER CAMERON TO TIGHTEN BENEFITS FOR MIGRANTS TREATY CHANGE APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER STICKING POINT
THE GUARDIAN SAYS BRITISH OFFICIALS HAVE CONCEDED THE PRIME MINISTER MAY FAIL IN HIS ORIGINAL DEMAND TO UNDERPIN HIS REFORMS BY CHANGING E.U. TREATIES THE MAT CARTOON IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH POKES FUN AT THE WRANGLING SUGGESTING THAT SOME OF THE PUBLIC ARGUMENTS ARE JUST FOR SHOW TWO WRESTLERS ARE PICTURED IN THE RING PUMMELLING EACH OTHER ONE SAYS I USED TO BE INVOLVED IN E.U. NEGOTIATIONS BUT I FOUND THEM TWO STAGE MANAGED AND ARTIFICIAL
MONTGOMERY WHO CREATED THE CONSERVATIVE HOME WEBSITE WRITES IN THE TIMES THAT HE'S LEAVING THE TORY PARTY HE DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED E.U. DEAL AS A CHARADE SAYING IT'S THE FINAL STRAW BUT HE ALSO THINKS THAT A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS UNDERWAY HE SAYS THE TORIES WHO DEFECTED TO UKIP BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION HAD BEEN REPLACED BY THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO USED TO VOTE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT
HE BELIEVES THE NEXT POLITICAL BLOOD TRANSFUSION INTO THE TORY BODY MAY WELL COME FROM EXILES FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S LABOUR PARTY CAMPAIGN TO ALLOW ALL CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE MENINGITIS B. VACCINE RECEIVES PLENTY OF COVERAGE AND AS THE LEAD IN THE NEWSPAPER IT'S BEEN BACKED BY THE PARENTS OF TWO YEAR OLD FABER DEBT WHO DIED ON VALENTINE'S DAY AFTER CONTRACTING THE ILLNESS THEIR PET OF THE PARENTS RELEASED A SHOCKING PICTURE WIDELY CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA SHOWING HER BODY CONSUMED BY A TERRIBLE RASH SHORTLY BEFORE SHE DIED
THE MALE IN THE TIMES BOTH PRINT THIS IMAGE ALONGSIDE OTHERS SHOWING HER BEFORE SHE BECAME ILL THE FORMER ENGLAND RUGBY STAR MATT DAWSON HAS ALSO RELEASED PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING HIS TWO YEAR OLD BOY RECOVERING IN HOSPITAL AFTER DEVELOPING MENINGITIS DAWSON SAYS THE PICTURES SHOW TWO WEEKS OF HELL
THE SUN ATTACKS APPLE OVER ITS REFUSAL TO HELP THE F.B.I. UNLOCKED THE I'FAITH AND USED BY THE COUPLE WHO KILLED FOURTEEN PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LAST DECEMBER IN WHAT INVESTIGATORS THINK WAS AN ACT OF TERRORISM THE PAPER ACCUSES THE COMPANY OF PRIORITISING WHAT IT CALLS CIVIL LIBERTIES PARANOIA OVER THE DISCLOSURE OF LIFESAVING INFORMATION TO AMERICAN AND BRITISH SPOOKS
THE OPPOSING VIEW IS FOUND IN THE INDEPENDENT IT WARNS SOFTWARE TO OVERRIDE THE PHONE SECURITY FEATURES COULD BE USED FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES AND IT THINKS THE U.S. SECURITY SERVICES WOULD ALSO USE SUCH A TOOL TO ACCESS DATA BELONGING TO OTHERS THE PAPERS REPORT A SPLIT IN THE WORLD OF BELL RINGING WITH CAMPANOLOGIST DIVIDED OVER WHETHER TO LOBBY FOR THE PAST TIME TO BE RECLASSIFIED AS A SPORT THOSE IN FAVOUR SAY IT'S MORE STRENUOUS THAN ANGLING OR SHOOTING AND MAKING IT A SPORT WOULD HELP ATTRACT YOUNGER RECRUITS BUT OTHERS FEAR SUCH A MOVE WOULD SEVER THE LINK BETWEEN CAMPANOLOGY AND THE CHURCH
THE TWO SIDES ARE ENGAGED IN A DING DONG BATTLE ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE HEADLINE IN THE TELEGRAPH IS BELL RINGING TO BECOME A SPORT PULL THE OTHER ONE
IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN MIDWIVES AND WOMEN'S CHARITIES ARE WORRIED ABOUT GOVERNMENT PLANS TO EXTEND THE CHARGING OF MIGRANTS FOR HEALTH CARE IN ENGLAND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS IT'S ALREADY SAVED ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS CHARGING MORE MIGRANTS FOR HEALTH CARE SINCE LAST APRIL NOW IT'S CONSULTING ON MAKING THEM PAY FOR A ANY AMBULANCE AND OTHER SERVICES
BUT THE CHARITY MATERNITY ACTION ARGUES THESE COSTS ARE CATCHING OUT MANY VULNERABLE PREGNANT WOMEN AND PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR BABY'S HEALTH AT RISK NICHOLAS DAMAGE REPORTS
WITH HER SIX MONTH OLD BABY ON HER KNEE WE MEET A MOTHER WHO FLED UGANDA LAST YEAR THEY'RE AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF AN ASYLUM APPEAL STAYING WITH A FRIEND RELIANT ON FOOD AND CLOTHING DONATIONS HER WORDS ARE VOICED BY AN ACTOR FOR ANONYMITY WHEN DID YOU REALISE THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND WILL SOAR STRESSING VIOLENT IT TOOK ME TIME TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS ACTUALLY PREGNANT SO AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT I WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY
I WAS VERY STRESSED WORRIED I WAS DRAINED AND I COULD SAY I WASN'T FEELING WELL AS AN ASYLUM SEEKER THE FREE N.H.S. CARE SHE WAS ENTITLED TO DURING PREGNANCY WASN'T FORTHCOMING DESPITE SUFFERING ABDOMINAL PAINS ON HER FIRST VISIT TO A G.P. THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES
THEY TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY WE BUILD AT ANY POINT YES WHEN I WENT TO HOSPITAL FOR MIDWAY A STRIP THEY GAVE ME A BILL OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE
I WAS WORRIED AND CONFUSED BECAUSE I HAD TWO OR THREE WEEKS TO HAVE THE BABY AND THEY HAD ALREADY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST THOUSANDS TO HAVE THE BABY MONTHS AFTER THE BIRTH HER BILLS WERE CLEARED ACCORDING TO THE CHARITY DOCTORS OF THE WORLD IN ONE SIX MONTH PERIOD THEY SAW ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MIGRANTS WHO'D EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS REGISTERING WITH A G. G.P. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ELIGIBLE DOCTOR CLARE SHORT HAUL FROM THE CHARITY IS CONCERNED ABOUT PREGNANT WOMEN GETTING CAUGHT UP IN COSTLY N.H.S. CHARGES
WE HAD TWO CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR BABIES AND IN BOTH THOSE TWO CASES THEY HAD BEEN
DID THEY HAVE TO PAY THAT MONEY THEY WEAR PURSUED FOR PAYING THAT MONEY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN HONEY TO PAY ANOTHER WOMAN WE MEET FROM NIGERIA IS PAYING BACK THOUSANDS OF POUNDS FOR HAVING HER BABY IN THE U.K. AFTER OVERSTAYING A VISA BUT BEFORE APPLYING TO SETTLE HERE THE KIND OF PERSON THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO CLAMP DOWN ON
NOW A SINGLE MUM SHE SLEEPS IN A ONE BEDROOM WITH HER TWO CHILDREN IN A HOUSE WITH FRIENDS HOW WORDS ARE ALSO VOICED BY AN ACTOR
AFTER FOUR MONTHS I RECEIVED A BILL FOR THE HOSPITAL FOR FOR FILES AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR POUNDS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO KEEP SENDING ME LETTERS IF I DON'T PAY THE MONEY I'M GOING TO GO TO COURT BAILIFFS ARE GOING TO COME FROM I THINK
AS TO BE TWENTY POUNDS FIFTY A MONTH AND I'VE STARTED PAIN IT I GOT PREGNANT AGAIN AND I'M SCARED BECAUSE I'M PAINT FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS AND JUST SCARED IF I GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GIVE BIRTH AGAIN MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE ME ANOTHER BILL
I WAS SO SCARED I COULDN'T CONTINUE WITH IT I WENT FOR AN ABORTION YOU DON'T THINK THINGS WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU BACK IN NIGERIA NO I WISH MY KIDS TO STUDY HERE AND NOT TO GO BACK FOR NOW I JUST WANT THEM TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE HERE FOR THE ABORTION A G.P. GAVE HER THE NUMBER OF A CLINIC WHERE SHE WASN'T CHARGED
NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSULTING ON EXTENDING CHARGES TO A.&E. AND OTHER SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS VISITORS AN INTERVIEW WAS DECLINED BUT IT WAS EMPHASISED THAT URGENT CARE AND MATERNITY SERVICES SHOULD NEVER BE REFUSED UPFRONT
CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANDREW BRIDGEND VOICES THE GOVERNMENT'S CONCERNS ABOUT HEALTH TOURISM IT SHOULD NOT COME TO THE U.K. WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WHETHER THEY'RE HEALTHY
PREGNANT OR WHETHER THEY'RE NOT PREGNANT YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT A BRITISH CITIZEN TO TRAVEL TO AMERICA AND SUDDENLY GET FREE HEALTH CARE YOU EXPECT TO GET CHARGED AND THAT SHOULD BE THE SAME IN THE U.K. WE HAVE HAD A GREAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE WE'RE NOT THE INTERNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE THE CHARITY MATERNITY ACTION ESTIMATES THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WOMEN WHO'VE BEEN REFUSED ASYLUM GIVE BIRTH IN THE U.K. EVERY YEAR
DIRECTOR ROSS BRAGG IS COORDINATING ACTION TO CHANGE GOVERNMENT POLICY BEFORE N.H.S. CHARGES ARE EXTENDED IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT SOMEONE WHO'S COME TO THE U.K. SPECIFICALLY TO OBTAIN HEALTHCARE ALL'S COME JUST AS A TOURIST THEY SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH A COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK WHAT WE'RE SEEING GOES WELL BEYOND THAT THESE ARE WOMEN MANY AFFINITY FOR YEARS
MANY OF WHOM ARE MARRIED TO OR LIVING WITH YOU KAY PARTNERS WOMEN ARE OFTEN QUITE VULNERABLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ASYLUM SYSTEM HAVE ENDED UP DESTITUTE AND THEIR PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT ERIC TOOK STONE CHARGING EVEN FURTHER SO THE BASIC PHARMACEUTICALS WILL BE CHARGED FOR AMBULANCE SERVICES ANY DENTAL CARE ALL OF THESE ARE CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THE CARE THAT WOMEN SHOULD RECEIVE DURING THEIR PREGNANCY
THE CHARGES AFFECT ENGLAND REFUSED ASYLUM SEEKERS RECEIVE FREE N.H.S. CARE IN SCOTLAND AND WALES THE CONSULTATION PROCESS ENDS ON MUCH THE SIX WITH THE AIM OF INTRODUCING PROPOSALS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN
NICOLA STAND BRIDGE REPORTING THE TIME IS NOW TEN TO SEVEN RAIL PASSENGERS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ARE THE LEAST SATISFIED IN THE COUNTRY THE FINDING OF A SURVEY OF NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND PASSENGERS CARRIED OUT BY THE CONSUMER MAGAZINE WHICH ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RICHARD LLOYD IS HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING ON A MISSION WHY ARE THEY SO DISSATISFIED
BASIC FINDING HERE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE THREE QUARTERS OF PEOPLE WE ASKED SAID THEY SIMPLY WEREN'T GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY FOR A RANGE OF REASONS DIRTY TRAINS TRAINS WHERE YOU CAN'T GET A SEAT THE POOR CONDITION OF TRAINS BUT THAT BIG DRIVE OF THIS DISSATISFACTION IS PUNCTUALITY TOO MANY TRAINS TOO LATE TOO OFTEN AND IN PARTICULAR WE FOUND THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH COMMUTER SERVICES AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE SOUTH EAST BUT OF COURSE THAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE THE MOST CONGESTED SERVICES AT THAT TIME DES ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
THEY ARE BUT THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT THOSE OPERATORS COULD DO TO DEAL WITH THIS MASSIVE PROBLEM OF DISSATISFACTION THEY COULD BEEP CAN YOU GIVE PEOPLE BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT DELAYS THEY COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CLAIM REFUNDS WHEN THE TRAIN HASN'T TURNED UP OR IT'S BEEN WOEFULLY LATE IT'S THIS TREATMENT OF THE PASSENGER THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM THEY'RE TREATED LIKE SELF LOADING FREIGHT OF SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED US WHICH ARE THE WORST OPERATORS
THE WORST OPERATORS ARE IN IN THE SOUTH EAST IT SOUTH EASTERN THAMES LINK PEOPLE USING THOSE ROOTS WILL BE WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME OPERATORS AND IN PARTICULAR ON LINES WHERE THERE'S COMPETITION ON THE RAIL WHERE IT'S BEEN SHOWN YOU CAN GET THIS RIGHT WAY EVEN IN THE SOUTH EAST EVEN IN THE SOUTH EAST WHERE CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED WHERE CLEARLY OPERATORS ARE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE PASSENGER
DOING ALL THEY CAN EVEN IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE SERVICE TO INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT DELAYS AND TO GIVE PEOPLE REFUNDS AUTOMATICALLY SO WHICH ONES ARE THOSE THAT THAT CAME OUT OF AT THE TOP OF THIS SURVEY WERE THE VERY TOP WAS GRAND CENTRAL IT'S WHICH RUNS A SERVICE FROM SUNDERLAND OR BRADFORD TO LONDON OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE THE LEISURE SERVICES SO AGAIN THEY'RE NOT UNDER THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT THE COMMUTER SERVICES ARE ARE UNDER
BUT IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY COMMUTER SERVICES ARE BEING RUN WELL ARE BEING RUN MORE PUNCTUALLY AND PEOPLE ARE MORE SATISFIED BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A SEASON TICKET WHAT THEY'RE GETTING SIMPLY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN FOUND THROUGHOUT THESE SURVEYS THAT WE DO EVERY YEAR IS THIS FAR THE FEELING OF VERY FOR POOR VALUE FOR MONEY YOU MADE THE POINT ABOUT DELAYS AND COMPENSATION
IT IT IS IT IS IT JUST A BIT OF A LOTTERY AS TO HOW EASY IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE AFTER WHAT POINT IN HAVE A DELAY JOURNEY ARE YOU ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION WHERE HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED TO US ABOUT THIS AND IN FACT WE'VE SUBMITTED A SUPER COMPLAINT TO THE RAIL REGULATOR BECAUSE WE FOUND THE SYSTEM OF RAIL REFUNDS SO POUR THE RULES VARY ACCORDING TO THE LINE ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF TICKET THE BASIC RULE IS IF YOU'RE THIRTY MINUTES DELAYED THEN YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO SOMETHING OR MOST ROUTES
THE GAME FOR THE PASSENGER YOU'VE GOT TO DO SO MUCH WORK TO WORK THAT OUT AND THEN TO GET THE REFUND WHAT WE THINK SHOULD ULTIMATELY HAPPEN IS FOR THE RAIL OPERATORS TO GIVE PEOPLE AUTOMATIC REFUNDS BUT OVERALL THIS PICTURE SAYS TO US WE NEED A RAIL REGULATOR THAT IS UNAMBIGUOUSLY THERE FOR THE PASSENGER THERE FOR THE CONSUMER STANDING UP FOR THEIR INTERESTS AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE DO GET A DECENT SERVICE FOR THEIR MONEY RICHARD LLOYD FROM WHICH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S CRUNCH TIME IT'S A CRITICAL MOMENT I THINK WE'RE GETTING A BIT OVER EXCITED ABOUT ONE MEETING HERE IN BRUSSELS LATER TODAY AFTER ALL WHATEVER THE TWENTY EIGHT E.U. LEADERS AGREE ON THE FINER DETAILS OF CHILD BENEFIT OR EVEN EVER CLOSER UNION WE HAVE HAD YEARS TO THINK ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT IT SO CUT THESE NEGOTIATIONS MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY THAT WE MIGHT VOTE IN A REFERENDUM
ON WHETHER TO STAY OR GO WHAT CATHERINE PEACOCK HE'S THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF POLLING COMPANY COMRADES AND JOINS US FROM LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT SEEMS ASTONISHING IS THAT THERE ARE STILL A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF VOTERS WHO YOU HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MIND YES FORTY TWO PERCENT OF VOTERS WHO ACTUALLY STATED HER OPINION WHETHER THEY WOULD ACTUALLY VOTE TO LEAVE OR REMAIN SAY THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY STILL CHANGE THEIR MIND
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THAT IS SPLIT VERY EVENLY BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPS HAVE REMAIN AND LEAVE BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT CORE VOTE OR DEMOGRAPHICS CONSERVATIVE VOTERS MORE THAN HALF OF CONSERVATIVE VOTERS STILL SAY THAT THEY MIGHT CHANGE THEIR MIND COMPARED TO JUST OVER A THIRD OF LABOUR VOTERS SO IT IS THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS TO REALLY PLAYFUL AND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN TELL THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW THEY
WHETHER THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND IS IT DOWN TO WHAT COMES OUT OF FOR EXAMPLE A MEETING TODAY
OR CERTAINLY VOTERS ARE SAYING THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE DEAL AND THAT PERCEIVES SUCCESS OF THE DAY WAS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THEIR VOTE IF PEOPLE HE STEVE THE DEAL TO BE SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. BUT IN TERMS OF THE DECIDING FACTORS WHAT THE PUBLIC ARE LOOKING FOR IS FIRSTLY CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS ENTERING THE U.K. BUT ALSO CONTROL OVER BRITAIN'S REALLY IS THAT ISSUE OF WIDER SOVEREIGNTY
RIGHT AND IN TERMS OF WHO HAS THAT SAY WHEN THIS TEXT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED THE PAPERS THE NEXT DAY COMPLETELY SLAMMED IT IS THAT THE SORT OF THING THAT THE PAPERS WHO AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE FRONT PAGES THAT WILL INFLUENCE PEOPLE
ABSOLUTELY SO VOTERS SAY THAT DAVID CAMERON AND WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND AMONG UNDECIDED VOTERS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT VOICES AND THERE'S A FOUR WAY TIE HAVE BORIS JOHNSON THERESA MAY GEORGE OSBORNE AND JEREMY BEN BUT ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT IS GOING TO BE HOW IT'S PERCEIVED AMONG THE WIDER MEDIA AND WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY BETRAYED TO A SUCCESS OR FAILURE
RIGHT BUT DAVID CAMERON AND THE WAY HE PRESENTS IT IS CRITICAL TO THAT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND THE FISHING RIGHT AND CAN LET'S ASSUME THERE'S SOME DEAL STRUCK IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR JUST OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE REFERENDUM THIS SOME TIME UNTIL IT THAT WOULD BE IN JUNE AND THINGS COULD CHANGE QUITE A BIT IN THAT
WELL ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT VOTERS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY REMAIN OR LEAVE CAMPS AT THE MOMENT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT CAMERON WILL BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DEAL ONLY A FIFTH OF PEOPLE THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DEAL SO HOW HOW THIS IS DISGUST BUT ALSO ACTUALLY PUTTING A DATE DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL WE DON'T YET HAVE THE TWO SIDES COMPLETELY FIRMED UP YET SO THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN STILL CHANGE
A LOT THAT MIGHT CHANGE IN THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS KATHRYN PEACOCK THANKS VERY MUCH THANKS IT'S THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND STABBED HER NAILS AS THIS MORNING'S WEATHER FORECASTER THANK YOU MICHELLE GOOD MORNING TO YOU TODAY SHAPING UP TO BE MAINLY FINING DRY PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AROUND PARTICULARLY CENTRAL EASTERN PARTS BUT SHOWERS WILL AFFECT WESTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. PARTICULARLY WESTERN SCHOLAR WHERE SOME COULD BE HEAVY WITH HAIL AND THUNDER AND THEN TOMORROW'S LOOKING WETTER AND WINDIER AND A LITTLE BIT MILDER AND THEN REMAINS UNSETTLED INTO THE WEEKEND
TODAY I'LL START WITH ENGLAND HAVE GOT A COLD FROSTY START ACROSS NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF THE RISK OF ICE IN PLACES ON UNTREATED SURFACES BUT LESS COLD FOR EASTERN AND SOUTH EASTERN AREAS WITH RAIN AND HILL SNOW CONTINUE TO EASE AWAY FROM EAST ANGLIA AND THE SOUTH EAST IN TOWARDS KENT THEN FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND THE AT A LARGELY SUNNY DAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AFFECTING SOUTH WESTERN PARTS AND NORTH WESTERN PARTS AT TIMES A LITTLE MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUD HERE
AND IT WILL BE A CHILLY DAY TEMPERATURES FIVE TO NINE CELSIUS FOR WALES IT'S COLD DRY FROSTY START WITH SOME ICE AROUND FIRST THING BUT IT WILL BE SUNNY THROUGH THE MORNING AND LARGELY DRY INTO THE AFTERNOON A BIT OF CLOUD BUILDING ACROSS WESTERN PARTS WITH THE ODD LIGHT SHOWER MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY AND IT WILL BE CHILLY SIX TO SEVEN CELSIUS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT'S A COLD FROSTY START WITH SOME ICE AROUND FIRST THING BUT MAINLY DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE
HOWEVER WESTERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHWEST NORTHERN IRON WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY AND SOME WILL BE HEAVY BUT THE CHANCE OF HAIL AND THUNDER MIXED IN IT WILL BE COLD HIGHS OF FIVE TO SEVEN CELSIUS AND THEN TOMORROW I CAN MENTION IS A COLD DRY SUNNY FROSTY START ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE U.K. BUT IT'S GOES DOWNHILL THROUGH THE DAY WITH CLOUD RAIN SPREADING EASTWARDS ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY WITH STRENGTHENING SOUTH WESTERLY WIND

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON IS HEADING TO A CRUCIAL SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS WHERE HE'LL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE THE LEADERS OF EVERY COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO ADOPT HIS REFORMS TO BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO MAKE A HISTORIC TRIP TO CUBA AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF HOSTILITIES
THE POLICE WATCHDOG HAS WARNED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLARKSTON DAVID CAMERON'S ATTEMPT TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS REACHING A CLIMAX AS LEADERS OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS MEET FOR A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
THE U.K.'S DEMANDS WILL TOP THE AGENDA AT THE FIRST SESSION OF THE TWO DAY GATHERING WHICH WILL ALSO DISCUSSED THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK HAS WARNED THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FOR MISTER CAMERON COULD LEAD TO AN INSIDE REFERENDUM ON THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP AS EARLY AS JUNE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
A COMPLEX DEAL IS WITHIN REACH BUT NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED JUST ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES COULD DELAY EVERYTHING ONLY WHEN THE TWENTY EIGHT NATIONAL LEADERS SIT DOWN TO NEGOTIATE FACE TO FACE WITH THE EXTENT OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS BECOME CLEAR
ANYTHING FROM PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE MEANING OF THE TERM EVER CLOSER UNION COULD PROVOKE LENGTHY DEBATE LAWYERS WILL BE ON HAND TO GO THROUGH THE FINE DETAIL
THE U.K. DEMAND FOR A CAST IRON GUARANTEE THAT THE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED BY DAVID CAMERON WILL EVENTUALLY BE ENSHRINED IN THE E.U. TREATIES IS ONE OF MANY DIFFICULT LEGAL OBSTACLES IN ADDITION MANY COUNTRIES REMAIN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO ANY SUGGESTION THAT CHANGES TO WELFARE PAYMENTS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE U.K. IN MIND COULD BE ADOPTED BY OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THE FUTURE
SO THERE IS PLENTY THAT COULD STILL GO WRONG BUT THERE'S ALSO A FEELING THAT FURTHER DELAY WON'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER TO REACH A DEAL THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH DISCUSSION OF THE U.K. ISSUE WILL BEGIN THIS AFTERNOON CONTINUE LATE INTO THE NIGHT AND RESUME AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE AN HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS MARKING A TURNING POINT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF HOSTILITY WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT MISTER OBAMA WILL TRAVEL TO HAVANA AS PART OF A WIDER TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
WHEN AIRFORCE ONE TOUCHES DOWN IN HAVANA IT'LL HAVE BEEN A THREE HOUR FLIGHT FROM WASHINGTON THAT IT'S TAKEN OVER HALF A CENTURY TO MAKE BUT THE SPEED WITH WHICH THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS THAWED HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF BREATHTAKING
IT WAS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO THAT PRESIDENTS A BARBER AND RAUL CASTRO SAID THEY WANTED TO PUT THE HOSTILITY OF THE COLD WAR BEHIND THEM LAST SUMMER THEY RESPECTED EMBASSIES REOPENED IN WASHINGTON AND HAVANA AND EARLIER THIS WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF THERE BEING THE OCCASIONAL CHARTER FLYING INTO CUBA FROM THE U.S. COMMERCIAL AVIATION WOULD RESUME WITH ONE HUNDRED AND TEN FLIGHTS A DAY FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND
THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE RELATIONS ARE COMPLETELY NORMALISED THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY WHO THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE TOO FAR TOO QUICKLY
TIGHT SECURITY REMAINS AND PLACED AROUND GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA OR DAY AFTER AN EXPLOSION KILLED AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE AND WOUNDED MORE THAN SIXTY OTHERS C.C.T.V. FOOTAGE RELEASED BY THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES SHOWS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CAR BOMB GOING OFF NEAR BUSES CARRYING MILITARY PERSONNEL NO ONE HAS SAID THEY CARRIED OUT THE BOMBING
AN INSPECTION REPORT HAS WARNED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IN ENGLAND AND WALES IS AT RISK BECAUSE FRONTLINE OFFICERS ARE BEING TUCKED AWAY AND ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS REFORMED POLICING TO MAKE IT MORE PROFESSIONAL AND LESS BUREAUCRATIC HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DUMMY SURE
ALTHOUGH THE INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY FOUND THAT POLICE WERE GOOD AT PREVENTING CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IT SAID THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF EIGHTEEN OF THE FORTY THREE FORCES WAS SUBSTANDARD IT WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING WAS BEING ERODED AS BEAT OFFICERS SPENT FEWER HOURS ON PATROL AND MORE TIME RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS GUARDING CRIME SCENES AND STAFFING FRONT COUNTERS
INSPECTOR SAID THERE WAS A RISK THE POLICE SERVICE WAS SLEEPWALKING TO A RETURN TO ITS OLD APPROACH WHERE OFFICERS WERE ISOLATED FROM COMMUNITIES SINCE TWENTY TEN ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND POLICE POST'S INCLUDING THOSE OF CIVILIAN STAFF AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS HAVE BEEN CUT BUT THE INSPECTORATE SAID THE PROBLEMS WITH NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING WERE NOT AN INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE JOB CUTS BUT AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THEM
THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE TODAY ON THE CONTROVERSIAL COMMON LAW OF JOINT ENTERPRISE WHICH HAS BECOME AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROSECUTE MURDER ESPECIALLY IN CASES INVOLVING GROUPS THE CASE CENTRES ON AN APPEAL BY A MEANS YOGI WHO WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER BECAUSE HE ENCOURAGED A FRIEND TO STAB A FORMER POLICEMAN
CAMPAIGNERS CLAIM THAT AROUND SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE SERVING SENTENCES AS A RESULT OF UNJUST JOINT ENTERPRISE CONVICTIONS ARE LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN REPORTS
JOINT ENTERPRISE CAN APPLY TO ALL CRIMES BUT RECENTLY IT'S BEEN A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROSECUTING MURDER ESPECIALLY IN CASES INVOLVING GANGS OF YOUNG MEN INCLUDING THOSE CONVICTED OF THE MURDER OF FATHER OF THREE GARRY NEWLOVE IN WARRINGTON IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT'S CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE MANY BELIEVE IT TOO EASILY ALLOWS THOSE WHO PLAY A MINOR ROLE TO BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER THERE'S NO NEED TO PROVE AN INTENTION TO KILL OR HARM TO BE GUILTY OF MURDER
THE PROSECUTION NEED ONLY PROVE THAT A PERSON FORESAW THAT THE PERSON THEY WERE WITH MIGHT KILL OR MIGHT INFLICT SERIOUS HARM TODAY'S JUDGEMENT WILL CONSIDER THE CONTENTIOUS FOR SIGHT TEST AND COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE FOR MURDER THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT OR INVOLVED BUT DON'T INFLICT THE FATAL BLOW
A SURVEY SUGGESTS REAL PASSENGERS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ARE THE LEAST SATISFIED AND BRITAIN THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH POLLED SEVEN THOUSAND TRAVELLERS AND SAID SOUTH EASTERN THAMES LINK AND A BELLY A GREATER ANGLIA WERE BOTTOM OF THE PILE WITH PEOPLE SIGHTING DELAYS POOR VALUE FOR MONEY AND DIRTY CARRIAGES GRAND CENTRAL CAME TOP OF THE TABLE
THE RAIL DELIVERY GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS TRAIN OPERATORS AND NETWORK RAIL SAYS ANOTHER RECENT SURVEY SUGGESTED THAT OVERALL SATISFACTION AMONG REAL PASSENGERS WAS UP RICHARD LLOYD FROM WHICH TOLD US THAT IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE
THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT THOSE OPERATORS COULD DO TO DEAL WITH THIS MASSIVE PROBLEM OF DISSATISFACTION THEY COULD BEEP CAN YOU GIVE PEOPLE BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT DELAYS THEY COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO CLAIM REFUNDS WHEN THE TRAIN HASN'T TURNED UP OR IT'S BEEN WOEFULLY LATE IT'S THIS TREATMENT OF THE PASSENGER THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM THEY'RE TREATED LIKE SELF LOADING FREIGHT OF SOMEONE ONCE DESCRIBED
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT'S AWARE THAT RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IS MISSING FROM A STORAGE FACILITY NEAR THE CITY OF BASRA IN SOUTHERN IRAQ OFFICIALS SAY THE MATERIAL WHICH IS USED TO TREAT CANCER COULD BE USED AS A WEAPON IF IT'S ACQUIRED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP BUT A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ANY GROUP HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET HOLD OF THE MATERIAL
MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS HAVE SUFFERED FROM VERY SERIOUS ERRORS KNOWN AS NEVER EVENTS IN HOSPITALS AND ENGLAND OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS ACCORDING TO AN INVESTIGATION BY THE PRESS ASSOCIATION NEWS AGENCY THEY RANGE FROM BODY PARTS BEING REMOVED BY MISTAKE TO OBJECT OBJECTS BEING LEFT INSIDE PATIENTS AFTER AN OPERATION MORE DETAILS FROM HELEN LEE
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PATIENTS HAD THE WRONG BODY PART OPERATED ON IN ONE CASE A WOMAN HAD HER FILL OPIUM TUBES REMOVED INSTEAD OF HER APPENDIX OTHERS HAD SURGERY ON THE WRONG HIPS EYES AND KNEES
THE FIGURES ALSO REVEALED THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE HAD FOREIGN OBJECTS LIKE NEEDLES AND SWABS LEFT INSIDE THEM AFTER OPERATIONS AND H. S. ENGLAND SAID ONE NEVER EVENT IS TOO MANY AND A SET OF NATIONAL STANDARDS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IS THERE TO HELP HOSPITAL STAFF PREVENT THEM
SCIENTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES STUDYING A TINY SEA SNAIL I'VE DISCOVERED THAT IT SWIMS USING THE SAME MOVEMENT AS FLYING INSECTS THE SO CALLED SEA BUTTERFLY HAS TO WING LIKE APPENDAGES WHERE MOST SNAILS HAVE A SINGLE FOOT
RESEARCHERS AT GEORGIA TAG IN THE U.S. FIND THE SNAILS WINGTIPS TRIS I HAD A FIGURE OF EIGHT TO GENERATE LIFT LIKE A BEE DOCTOR DAVID MURPHY SAYS IT WASN'T WHAT THEY WERE EXPECTING
ON THE STARS OF PLANKTON USE THEIR SWIMMING APPENDAGES LIKE PANELS AND SO I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT BUT IF I WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED AT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE MORE OF AN HONORARY INSECT
DOCTOR DAVID MURPHY THE TIME NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN EUROPEAN LEADERS HAVE NO CHOICE THEY HAVE TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE U.K. HERE IN BRUSSELS IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK TOLD THE B. B. C. YESTERDAY
BUT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE STILL VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE DEAL AND NOT PREPARED TO SAY YES AT LEAST NOT YET
NOT TO THE DRAFT AS THEY'VE SEEN IT WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN DRAFTING THE SETTLEMENT IN JUST A MOMENT FIRST THOUGH I WENT OUT LAST NIGHT IN THIS MOST EUROPEAN OF CITIES TO HEAR WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN BRUSSELS MAKE OF WHAT BRITAIN WANTS
WE'RE HERE REPORTING ON THE RENEGOTIATION
THE U.K. IN THE E.U. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT WHAT BRITAIN IS ASKING FOR DO YOU THINK HE'S ASKING FOR TOO MUCH FROM IT FROM EUROPE NOR PROBABLY GOOD MY DAY'S NOT ASKING FOR AT THE MATCH BUT
MISTER CAMERON IS ASKING FOR THE WRONG ANSWER MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK FOR MORE COMPRESSIVE US FOUR OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MAYBE HAVE THE GENERAL THEME WORK OR FOR WAR AKSA HI
FROM DENMARK YOU IMAGINE BRITAIN EVENING I WOULDN'T I'D LIKE TO I THINK YOU'RE WRONG THERE BELONGS TOGETHER
AND THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER BUT WE DON'T MIND THEIR EUROPEAN DO YOU MEANT TO BE AND THEN YOUR CARD WHERE YOU CAN PICK WHAT YOU LIKE
WHEN I STEP ON THEM YOU'RE FROM SPAIN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT BRITAIN IS TRYING TO DO
I'M A BIT PUZZLED ABOUT THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE HOW THINGS LIKE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE
MAKES A CHICK HUGE DIFFERENCE TO THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP
HERE'S SOMEONE FROM CYPRUS BY THEIR SUPPER GALLEYS BETTER IN THIS MOMENT OF A CRISIS
THAT HE WAS TO STICK TOGETHER SO IT'S A BIG COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.K. CERTAINLY EVA THE HOLLOW
I'M FRENCH YOU'RE FRENCH WERE ALL EUROPEAN OR NOT AND I THINK THEY SHOULDN'T BE NEGOTIATING ANYTHING TO GET OUT
UNIONS THAT WISHES THEY WERE
ONLY IN BRUSSELS CAN YOU STOP ONE AND THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE STREET AND THEY UNDERSTAND EMERGENCY BRAKE WELL OVERNIGHT THE LATEST DRAFT TEXT OF THE SETTLEMENT EMERGED WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED THAT IT WOULD BE PUBLISHED YESTERDAY THEN IT DIDN'T COME AND NOW IT HAS WHETHER IT'S BEEN LEAKED OR EMERGED SOMEHOW AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY OUR EUROPE EDITOR CATCHIER ADLER AND CATCH YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK OVER IT AND AND HOW IT'S CHANGED SINCE THE LAST ONE WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU
WELL IT'S BEEN TWEAKED REALLY RATHER THAN DRAMATIC CHANGES BUT I THINK IN A BROADLY SPEAKING THE STICKING POINTS CLEARLY REMAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT WILL DAVID CAMERON ACTUALLY GET TREATY CHANGE AT THE AT THE END OF THIS SUMMIT OF MEETINGS OF ALL THE E.U. LEADERS WHAT ABOUT THE CITY OF LONDON SAFEGUARDS AGAINST EUROZONE LEGISLATION THAT'S STILL A VERY VEXED POINT AS ARE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF CHANGING YOU MIGRANT BENEFITS IN THE U.K. AND WHETHER THAT
OPTION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES AS WELL I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS WILL SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO REALLY BASHED THIS ABOUT IN DETAILS
TODAY IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO PERSONAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL CHEMISTRY BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY BIG ISSUES STILL OPEN AS ONE SOURCE CLOSE NEGOTIATIONS TOLD ME YESTERDAY THERE ARE ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH THE POLITICAL WILL TO GET DAVID CAMERA DEAL IS THERE BUT FOR EXAMPLE HE SAID YOU LOOK AT THE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE CITY OF LONDON
THESE ARE VERY VERY TECHNICAL DETAILS AND AS HE PUT BUT NEEDS AND HIS WORDS YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE THAT KIND OF DETAIL TO POLITICAL LEADERS THEY'RE GOOD AT THE PIG BIG PICTURE AT NOT AT THE SMALL DETAIL AND THIS IS REALLY POINTY HEADED STUFF PLUS AS HE POINTED OUT WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT MIGRANT BENEFITS BUT THE STAKEHOLDERS THERE ARE VERY FAR AWAY TODAY FROM THEIR LEADERS WHEN IT COMES TO
BANKING PROVIDING SAFEGUARDS FOR BANKING OR FROM FRANCE AND GERMANY TO SOME EXTENT ARE WORRIED THAT SAFEGUARD FOR THE CITY LONDON MEANS UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR THE CITY OF LONDON THEY HAVE THE BIG LOBBIES BANK LOBBIES BEHIND THEM AND THEY HAVE DIRECT PHONE NUMBERS AND THAT'S WHERE IT COULD GET COMPLICATED MY CATCHER WILL GET MUCH MORE FROM YOU LATER IN THE PROGRAMME NOW THE WAY IT WORKS IN BRUSSELS IS THREE EMMY PEAS KNOWN AS SHERPAS FROM DIFFERENT POLITICAL GROUPINGS
ARE GIVEN THE JOB OF BEING THE GO BETWEEN SAYS THEY'RE TRYING TO THRASH OUT THE THE DRAFT AND THEN THE REVISED OF THE DRAFT UNTIL WE GET TO THIS FINAL SETTLEMENT AND ONE OF THEM IS THE ITALIAN SOCIALIST M.E.P. ROBERTO GROUTY AIRY AND HE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GIVEN WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THESE VARIOUS DRAFTS DO YOU THINK THAT A DEAL CAN BE STRUCK OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS
I'VE BEEN HERE ALL WEEK BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVIDE GOOD THANK YOU CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THESE SQUARE BRACKET THEY'RE THE BITS IN THE TEXT THAT HAVE YET TO BE DECIDED AND THEY'RE STILL SEEM AN AWFUL LOT OF THEM AND ON SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO REMOVE THE SQUARE BRACKETS WHAT PROBLEMS DO YOU
ENTERING TO BE LOOK THE DEBTS BECAUSE ASYLUM BUT WOMEN SHE SHOULDN'T SCHOOL I WOULD NOT CALL MENTAL LEAT X. BUT GOOD INDEED THAT THE BRACKETS MEAN THAT GOLD'S PARAGRAPH FOR LEAD FEEL COULD BE DISCUSSED AMBER
BUT JUST JUST BRIEFLY GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE IN IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS IS THERE A MOOD TO GET A DEAL DONE ARE THE TWO SIDES THAT FAR APART AND I THINK THE BEDROOM ARE YOU CLEVER OR LEAD TO GO LEVEL
VERY DEEPLY CALEY AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A LEAK AND IT'S WORKING WITH NOT THAT I CAN COOK FINE HANG ON TUNA WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY EVERYBODY THIS COULD BE A GOOD DIVER RICHARD BAKER REPORT I'VE GOT A PIECE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM YOU LOB IT OUT LITTLE NATION WORRIED YOU'RE COMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY YOUR SIZE TO GIVE MY MY DEAR YOU SAID COMPATIBLE WITH THE TREATY DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE TREATED
WHO IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CREAKY BUT EGO PUT THE CREAKY LOOKS AT THE WAY ANDO BUT THERE ARE SOME YOU SHOULD THANK CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TREATY AND WEBB THERE A NOT TO PEOPLE ADDICTED TO DROP THE BRACKETS ON THE BACK IT UP WHO THE FIRST TWO FUTURE QUICKLY CHANGE IT YOU CAN SCOOP IT AND YOU LEFT THAT FOR THE BULLY THE GOALIE THAT'S WHICH IS OAK THERE ARE LET ME ANSWER THE SLIPPY ENOUGH CURRENT
MARKETS HAVE GONE THE LORD OF MY NATION IN THE PEOPLE AND THERE'S SOME SOME HUMOUR EITHER MORE MEMBERS BEEF LEAST
GOOD LUCK ON THE GROUND OR BLACK COULD SUCCEED YOU COULD BE FLOP IS FIFTY FIVE BUT I THINK I'M A WITCH
RIGHT READY TO GO WE MUST WE MUST RETREAT
AND SALT WILL YOU
I BETTER GO AUNTIE EH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT IT WILL BE A LONG DISCUSSION AND DETAILED ONE WITH THE TIME NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ELECTRICITY AND GAS PRICES HAVE BEEN FALLING BUT WHAT HAS THAT MEANT TO THE SIZE OF YOUR BILL TANYA HAS MORE ON THAT IS NOT A GREAT DEAL IS THE SHORT ANSWER DISAPPOINTINGLY THERE HAS BEEN THIS MORNING WE'VE JUST HEARD A SHARP RISE IN PROFITS AT BRITISH GAS FOR WHICH THE HOLDING COMPANY IS CENTRICA OF COURSE
LAST YEAR OPERATING PROFITS WENT UP BY NEARLY A THIRD THIRTY ONE PERCENT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION SO THAT'S OPERATING PROFITS AND THAT COMPARES WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION A YEAR EARLIER THE COMPANY SAYS THIS IS IN PART DOWN TO CUSTOMERS USING MORE ENERGY A WAY WELL ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA SAW PROFITS FALL
BY TWELVE PERCENT TO ONE POINT FOUR SIX BILLION THAT HAS TO DO WITH FALLING WHOLESALE PRICES BUT HAVE THEY BEEN PASSED ON IAN CORN IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CENTRICA WELCOME TO YOU SO ELECTRICITY PRICES IN THE LAST YEAR ALSO FALLEN BY ABOUT A QUARTER GAS PRICES BY A THIRD YOU HAVE DELIVERED TO YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT IN TERMS OF PRICE CUTS WERE FIRST TO GOOD MORNING UM THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY
AS FAR AS OUR OVERALL RESULT JUST TO CLARIFY THAT UNDERLYING ADJUSTED EARNINGS FELL BY FOUR PERCENT AND OUR CASH FLOWS WERE UP FOR THE GROUP AS A WHOLE BUT WE DID HAVE TO TAKE SOME VERY BIG WRITE OFFS BECAUSE OF NAUSEA LOOK HOW DO YOU YES I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THING IS THAT YOUR COMPANY'S MADE UP OF TWO VERY DISTINCT PARTS
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE PRODUCTION SIDE ONE OF THEM IS THE RETAIL SIDE SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND I'D LIKE TO START ON THE RETAIL SIDE WHERE WHOLESALE PRICES COME DOWN CUSTOMERS WOULD EXPECT THEIR BILLS TO FOLLOW SO MY MY MY POINT IS THAT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THAT REFLECTED WELL ACTUALLY THEY HAVE AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOUR LISTENERS AND OBVIOUSLY OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE PASSED ON
MAJOR FALL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN GAS PRICES AND IN FACT THE FORTY ONE PERCENT FALL IN GAS PRICES WHICH I DO RECOGNISE HAS RESULTED IN A ABOUT A TEN PER CENT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TEN PER CENT FALL IN OUR COST OF GAS IN THE BILL
AND WE REDUCED PRICES LAST YEAR BY TEN PER CENT AND BEFORE THE WINTERS SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU FLACCID FURTHER WHAT COSTS IS IT A WINNER WHEN SOMEBODY IS PAYING A GAS BILL OR INDEED ELECTRICITY BILL TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THAT REFLECT WHOLESALE PRICES WELL THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD QUESTION TANYA BECAUSE THAT APPROACHING SIXTY PER CENT OF THE BILL
ISN'T THE GAS AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO THE GAS PRICES COME DOWN ONLY A PROPORTION OF THE BILL IS AN IMPACTED THE SECOND BIG THING IS THAT MANY CUSTOMERS ON THEY PAY FOR THEIR BILL OVER TIME ON AN AVERAGE PRICE AND WE BUY GAS OR HEAD OF TIME AND THEREFORE IF WE'VE BEEN BUYING IT AT HIGHER PRICES IT TAKES LONGER
FOR THE PRICE REDUCTION TO COME THROUGH BUT AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE LAST MONTH BECAUSE PRICES HAVE STAYED LOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING ANOTHER FIVE PERCENT CUT TO BEAR ON THE BILL AT FOURTEEN PERCENT TOTAL OVERLYING LAST YEAR O.K. LET'S TURN TO THE WHOLESALE SIDE OF THE BUSINESS YOU SEE OBVIOUSLY A DROP IN REVENUE WHEN YOU SEE WHOLESALE PRICES FOR SO YOU HAVE TO REDUCE YOUR COSTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INVESTOR HOW HARDY WORKING AT THAT
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT I THINK IN THE WHOLESALE SIDE OF IT THE NORTH SEA IN PARTICULAR IS UNDER A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS AT THE MOMENT WE'VE HAD TO TAKE WRITE OFFS OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS AGAINST ASSETS BOTH NORSE SEE ASSETS MAINLY NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT OF COURSE WE HAVE TO DO OUR PART WHICH IS TO CUT COSTS BUT INVESTMENT BUT WE'RE ALSO HOPING THAT THE CHANCELLOR IN THE FORTHCOMING BUDGET WILL CONSIDER REMOVING SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL TAXES THAT ARE LEVIED ON THE NORTH SEA AT LEAST UNTIL MARGINS BECOME A BIT MORE ROBUST INCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANKS DANI THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN
OI
TURKISH EMERGENCY SERVICES AT THE SCENE OF YESTERDAY'S CAR BOMB IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF CLOSE TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND TO GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS THE BOMB COMES AT A TIME OF GREAT TENSION IN TURKEY OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING ALONG ITS BORDER WITH SYRIA I KNOW I IS A FORMER TURKISH AMBASSADOR TO NATO AND JOINS US ON THE LINE WHO DO YOU THINK WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
WELL SO FAR NOBODY GLIMPSE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT SAY ANYTHING CONCRETE GO ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME PRESS REPORTS ARE SAYING IT'S PROBABLY THE TERRORISTS BELONGS TO A AND KURDISH GROUP FEW I.D. BUT HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHORITIES
AND THAT WOULD LINK HIT SORRY EXCUSE ME AND THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT TURKEY DOES ALONG THE BORDER WITH SYRIA
WELL DEFINITELY TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO OUR FRIENDS THERE'S A CLOSE LINK CO OPERATION BETWEEN P.K.K. AND PEE ALL RIGHT DEEK
AND THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE LOGGED YOUR I.D. SAW OPEN AN OFFICE IN THE MOSQUE WELL RECENTLY YOU SEE THE PORTRAIT OF P.K.K. AS THEIR SYMBOL YEAH THERE ARE AMERICAN TINK THANKS GIVING CONCRETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORPORATION WOULD FUEL LIKE THE M.P. KATE YOU'RE TALKING YOU'RE SO IT DOES THE BIT JUST EXPLAIN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT GROUPS OF TURKISH RABBI OF KURDISH REBELS
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT KURDISH P.K.K. TERRORIST ORGANISATION ALWAYS ATTACKING TURKISH TARGETS FOR FUEL THE CARE IT'S ANTHONY PUGH IDEA KURDISH ORGANISATION GIRDERS DURANT'S ORGANISATION MODERN SENIOR SEWER BUT I DO I'M AFRAID THAT YOU'D LIKE TO AGREE WITH GEORGE WESTERN LIES ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND ABOUT THE NEED TO COMBAT SPORTS ORGANISATIONS
IF IF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS CORRECT WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR POSSIBLE ESCALATION OF TURKISH ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN SHEDDING ACROSS THE BORDER FROM TURKEY INTO SYRIA THE SUGGESTION THAT
TURKEY MIGHT USE GROUND FORCES IS THAT LIKELY DO YOU THINK WELL IT STIRRED IT TO SAY THAT BUT IT'S ROOTS OF PROOF THAT HE NEEDS A BETTER CO OPERATION WITH OUR ALLIES IN COMBATING TERRORISM IN LORD RUMNEY RUG AND ORDNANCE LORD IN IRAQ AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEIR COUNTRY
DO THIS AND WE NEED TO BETTER CORPORATION INBOARD COUNTRIES SO THAT HOPEFULLY ENOUGH SUPPORT YEAH UNFORTUNATELY IF ONE AND LIES IN OUR COMBAT P.K.K. IN MODERN IRAQ
AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULDN'T A DISSING DIFFERENTIATE AND WANT THEIR SORREL'S ATIONS THERE'S NOT GOOD TERRORIST ORGANISATION THAT GHOST ORGANISATION AND INTERNATIONAL QUALITY IF WE HAVE TO SHOW MORE CORPORATION MORE SOLIDARITY AMONG US I KNOW I KNOW WASN'T IT AND SUGGESTING US TO SEE THAT PEOPLE WITH P.J. QUEUED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
WHEREAS THEY QUENTIN A TOUGH WORDS BY ALL MEANS I KNOW ROY MEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT IS AWARE OF REPORTS THAT RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM A STORAGE FACILITY IN SOUTHERN IRAQ FOR THEFT OF TEN GRAMMES OF AN IRIDIUM ISOTOPE WAS FIRST REPORTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY LATE LAST YEAR THERE ARE FEARS IT COULD BE USED AS A WEAPON THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN MARK TONER SAYS THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS OR ANY OTHER GROUP HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET HOLD OF IT
WHERE HAVE THE REPORTS THAT THERE MAY BE A LOST MAYBE LOST MISSING RADIOACTIVE SOURCE
WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY INDICATION THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY DASH OR ANY OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS IN THE REGION BUT OBVIOUSLY WE CONTINUE
TO TAKE HIS REPORTS VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION THE MATERIAL IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN KEPT IN A CASE THE SIZE OF A LAPTOP COMPUTER TO FACILITY RUN BY AN AMERICAN OIL SERVICES COMPANY MILES POMP OR A NUCLEAR TERRORISM EXPERT AT THE JAMES MARTIN CENTRE FOR NON PROLIFERATION STUDIES IN WASHINGTON AND I ASKED HIM HOW DANGEROUS THIS IRIDIUM ISOTOPE IS
IT'S A CATEGORY Q. SAUCE ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL TIME ARE GOING TO DO YOU CAN SEE WHICH MEANS IT'S A SECOND MOST DANGEROUS TYPE OF RADIOLOGICAL SAUCE THE FIRST TYPE WILL KILL YOU ALMOST IN SOME WAY
THE SECOND ONE CAN KILL YOU WITHIN HOURS OR DAYS IF YOU'RE WITHIN A CLOSE DISTANCE TO IT AND THIS ONE WAS BEING STORED AT A FACILITY USED BY THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY WHY IS IT USEFUL TO THEM THERE'S WERE USING WHAT'S CALLED A RADIOGRAPHY
CAMERA AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN X. RAY MACHINE EXCEPT FOR INSPECTING PIPES AND WELDS AND HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU AT THE REPORTS THAT THIS HAS GONE MISSING WELL IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE OUT THERE THERE ARE SOME QUALIFICATIONS THAT THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL THAT MIX IT A LITTLE LESS DANGEROUS
POTENTIALLY THAN SOME OTHER MATERIALS WINE IS THAT THERE'S A VERY REASONABLY SHORTHOUSE LICE SO DEPENDING ON HOW LONG IT WAS OUT THERE I MAY HAVE LOST ONE OF ITS POTENCY THE OTHER IS IN TERMS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF USING A DIRTY BOMB TENDS TO COME ON THE FONT PALLETS
I HAVE DIRTY BOMB OR WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL AND COMBINED WITH RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IN THERE
POWDER MATE WHAT SOME FORMS OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL OR AS THE WORST COS THAT WAS IT THAT SPREADS VERY EASILY WITH THE EXPLOSIVES AND HOW DIFFICULT IS THE PROCESS OF TURNING THIS RAW MATERIAL INTO A DIRTY BOMB
I'M NOT DIFFICULT AT ALL ABOUT BASICALLY ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING THAT MATERIAL WRAPPING WITH EXPLOSIVES AND THEN TO SETTING OFF THE BOMB THE FACT THAT IT APPEARS TO HAVE GONE MISSING WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU ABOUT THE WAY THAT THIS SORT OF MATERIAL ARE STORED IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD WELL IT'S NOT STORY THEY'RE VERY WELL BUT FRANKLY IT'S LUSTRE AND A LOT OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD ARE VERY WELL ONLY A YEAR AGO THERE WAS SIMILAR MISSING SWAPS OR MEXICO

LEADERS FOR THE REFORMS THAT HE STAKED HIS POLITICAL CAREER ON THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS
BUT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK HAS WARNED THAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED AT THE SUMMIT IF THERE IS A DEAL IT COULD TRIGGER A REFERENDUM IN BRITAIN POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS JUNE VOTERS WILL BE ASKED WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAY OR LEAVE THE E.U.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TO VISIT CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS MARKING A TURNING POINT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF HOSTILITY IT WILL BE THE FIRST VISIT BY A SITTING AMERICAN PRESIDENT SINCE THE CUBAN REVOLUTION IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
SECURITY REMAINS TIGHT AROUND GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA OR DAY AFTER A CAR BOMB KILLED AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE MORE THAN SIXTY OTHERS WERE WOUNDED NO ONE HAS SAID THEY CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK NEAR PARLIAMENT AND THE MILITARY'S HEADQUARTERS
THERE'S BEEN A SHARP RISE IN PROFITS OR BRITISH GAS OPERATING PROFITS SOARED BY THIRTY ONE PERCENT LAST YEAR TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS BRITISH GAS SAYS THIS WAS IN PART DUE TO CUSTOMERS USING MORE ENERGY
ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA SAW PROFITS DROP BY TWELVE PERCENT TO JUST UNDER ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS THE FULL WAS LARGELY BECAUSE OF LOWER WHOLESALE GAS AND POWER PRICES
A REPORT HAS REVEALED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE TEAMS AND ENGLAND AND WALES ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY HAS WARNED THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IS AT RISK BECAUSE OFFICERS ARE HAVING TO CARRY OUT OTHER DUTIES AWAY FROM THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
AN INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED A NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS ERRORS IN HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS AMONG THE ELEVEN HUNDRED CASES THE PRESS ASSOCIATION FIND THAT BODY PARTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY MISTAKE IN ONE CASE A WOMAN HAD HER FALLOPIAN TUBES REMOVED INSTEAD OF HER APPENDIX N.H.S. ENGLAND HAS HAD THAT ONE SERIOUS MISTAKE IS TOO MANY AND A SET OF NATIONAL STANDARDS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IS THERE TO HELP HOSPITAL STAFF PREVENT HEIRESS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT DAVID CAMERON ARRIVED IN BRUSSELS TODAY FOR ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS OF HIS TIME AS PRIME MINISTER CAN HE CONVINCE THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN LEADERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO GIVE HIM HIS DEAL A DEAL THAT HE CAN PRESENT TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND SAY THIS IS THE REASON TO SAY YES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHATEVER HE DOES COME HOME WITH TOMORROW IT'S LIKELY THAT THAT IS THE MOMENT THAT THE REFERENDUM DEBATE TRULY STARTS AND FEW PLACES WERE BEFORE MORE FIERCELY THAN IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ITSELF AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY DANIEL HANNAN WHO IS CONSERVATIVE M.E.P. FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND GOOD MORNING WHAT IS IT I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE TRUE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT HE CAN COME UP WITH TODAY THAT WOULD
SATISFY YOU YOU WANT OUT WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I WANTED OUT AS A MEANS TO AN END I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO WANTS BRICKS IT FOR THE SAKE OF IT WE ONLY SEE IT AS THE MEANS TO THE END OF A MORE PROSPEROUS AND FREE AND MORE DEMOCRATIC BRITAIN AND I HAD HOPED THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WE COULD HAVE DONE THROUGH AN AMICABLE RENEGOTIATION BUT IT'S NOW CLEAR THAT WE DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN A STATUS THAT COULD'VE LEFT
THE U.K. WITH A COMMON MARKET RATHER THAN A COMMON GOVERNMENT TYPE DEAL I'M SO GIVEN WHERE WE NOW ARE YES IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE P.M. WILL SUCCEED ONE HUNDRED PER CENT WITH THEIR PIFFLING AND TRIFLING CHANGES HE'S ASKING FOR BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE FOR WHOM THAT WAS THE DEFINING ISSUE I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYONE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME THINKING I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS ARE YOU THING BUT A PARTIAL PHASE MORATORIUM FOR BENEFITS MIGRANTS THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DO
AND SITTING HERE IN BRUSSELS WHAT DO YOU DO PICK UP IS THIS SENSE FROM OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BUT IT IS A BIG DEAL I MEAN QUITE ASIDE FROM ALL THAT OH LOOK THEY'RE JUST CHOREOGRAPHING IT'S ALL BEING STAGE MANAGE YOU GENERALLY GET THE SENSE FROM PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY
HE'S ASKING FOR A LOT OF THAT AND A GOOD CHOREOGRAPH AND STAGE MANAGED DOES I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE I BOUGHT THE LINE I'M AFRAID I THINK YOU HAVE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ANY PEAS OR EUROCRATS IN PRIVATE WHO THINKS THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE ALL OF THE SOUND AND FURY ALL OF THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE COME DOWN TO A MENDING ONE DIRECTIVE WHICH WE COULD HAVE DONE ANY TIME WITHOUT NEEDING ANY RENEGOTIATION PRIVATELY
THE EUROCRATS ARE WHOOPING AND HIGH FIVE INGHAM TURNING CARTWHEELS BECAUSE SO LITTLE HAS BEEN ASKED FOR AND YET ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE A HEARING THAT ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS AND THIS IS ALMOST A PROBLEM OF THE LAWYERS THAT IN TRYING TO GET SECURE SOMETHING FOR THE U.K. THEY'RE SAYING SECOND COD JUST PART OF THE U.K. THIS CHANGING OF WELFARE SO THAT IT'S PAID AT A RATE THAT SUITABLE FOR THEIR COUNTRY SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO GERMANY TO ITALY TO SPAIN TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND SUDDENLY YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S A LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT I DON'T REALLY THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUITE SMALL SUMS OF MONEY
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT I MEAN OF COURSE THE PRINCE WILL IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT YOU'RE PAYING CHILD BENEFIT TO A CHILD WHO IS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY CHILD BENEFIT IS FOR LOOKING AFTER A KID IT WHICH YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT DOING IF THE CHILD IS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY BUT THE SUMS ARE NOT HUGE AND I THINK THERE PROBABLY WAS GOING TO BE SOME MOVE ON WELFARE ANYWAY THE REASON THAT WE FOCUSED ON THIS REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE P.M. SET OUT HIS
PLAN FOR A RENEGOTIATION IN A REFERENDUM BACK IN THE BLOOMBERG SPEECH HE DIDN'T MENTION WELFARE HE DIDN'T MENTION MIGRATION WHY HAVE WE COME TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE BIG UNILATERAL REPATRIATION OF POWER THAT WERE PROMISED BACK IN THAT SPEECH HAVE PROVED ELUSIVE
NOT A SINGLE POWER NOT ONE IS BEING RETURNED FROM BRUSSELS TO LONDON AS A RESULT OF THIS DEAL IS NOT EVEN ON THE TABLE AND SO WET WE'RE HAVING THIS FOOTLING CONVERSATION ABOUT BENEFITS BECAUSE NONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE PROMISED IS DELIVERABLE OR AT LEAST HE'S DELIVERED AND I KNOW THERE WILL BE PLENTY PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT DO YOU ACCEPT THAT ACTUALLY TODAY ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND POSSIBLY ISN'T ABOUT OTHERS WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT COMING UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL PRESENT TO THE BROADER BRITISH PUBLIC WHO
THAT'S CONSERVATIVE PERHAPS PREFER THE STATUS QUO WHO CAN SAY O.K. I CAN SON OF COURSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OR OTHER I'M ALWAYS CORRECTING B. SEE PEOPLE WHEN THEY TALK IN THEIR INTRODUCTIONS BUT WILL THIS BE ENOUGH FOR THE TORIES I GET ONE VOTE DAVID CAMERA GETS ONE YOU GET ONE VOTE AND EVERYONE LISTENING GETS ONE OF US IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE TORY PARTY IS ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY CONSTITUENTS AND HIS AND LOOK GOOD IN A WAY BY MY QUESTION REALLY IS WILL IT BUY THEM OVER
AND I THINK WHAT PEOPLE LOOK WHEN PEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY LOOK ACROSS THE CHANNEL IS A DECLINING BLOCK THAT WE WOULDN'T BE JOINING TODAY YOU KNOW IN THE SEVENTIES IT LOOKED LIKE THE FUTURE NOW WITH A SHOWING IN AND EURO CRISIS PEOPLE ARE THINKING DO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT OUR PROBLEM ISN'T THERE A BRIGHTER FUTURE ACROSS THE OCEANS ON MORE DISTANT CONTINENTS ONE QUICK WORD YOU'RE AN M.E.P.
THERE WAS A COMMENT YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE BY SOMEBODY MAKING THEIR POINT THERE BY THE TIME THE PARLIAMENT THE M.E.P.S GET HOLD OF THIS IT'LL BE LIKE MONKEYS WITH GUNS THEY'RE COMPLETELY LOSE CONTROL YES WERE THEY THEY CERTAINLY CAN BE SIMEON OCCASIONALLY IN THEIR BEHAVIOUR
I THINK THAT THEY WILL PASS THIS DEAL BECAUSE THEY'LL BE TOLD TO BY THEIR PARTY LEADERS BUT THEY CAN THEN UND PASS IT TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR BECAUSE IT ISN'T A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IT IS JUST ONE AMENDMENT NORA KIDS BAG AND OUR POLITICAL EDITOR IS SITTING ALONGSIDE DANIEL HANNAN HERE WITH ME AND A LITTLE BRUSSEL STUDIO AND LAW IT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THIS WHICH IS SETTLED A EUROPEAN QUESTION THE RUNNING SORE FOR DECADES AT ME ARE WE IN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT
I THINK THERE IS AGONY HERE IN BRUSSELS OVER WHETHER OR NOT THESE CHANGES ARE REALLY MEANINGFUL OR WHETHER THEY'RE JUST NOTHING AS CONTESTS I THINK LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO REPRESENTS IF HE GOES DAVID CAMERON'S WAY UNLESS HE WILL CLAIM IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEW DEAL FOR THE U.K. AS HOPE OF SETTLING THE EUROPEAN QUESTION FOREVER ON FRIDAY HE WOULD GO HOME CALL A REFERENDUM THE BIGGEST VOTE THAT WE HAVE HAD IN PUBLIC FOR MANY MANY DECADES IF HE WINS HE'LL CLAIM THAT AS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT
THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT THAT WOULD SETTLE FOR EVER OR THE INTERNAL AGONY INSIDE HIS OWN PARTY ABOUT WHETHER TO STAY IN THE E.U. IS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING HE WILL HOPE THAT IT SETTLES THE QUESTION AT LEAST FOR THE TIME THE REMAINING TIME MAYBE NOT VERY LONG HAVE HIS OWN PREMIERSHIP BUT IN THE BIGGER CENSORED IT LET'S BE CLEAR IF HE LOSES THAT REFERENDUM
NOT LEAST IF THIS DEAL GETS POSTPONED FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS AND HE HAS TO HAVE THE REFERENDUM AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR IF HE LOSES THAT REFERENDUM THERE WOULD BE IMMEDIATE AND VERY INTENSE PRESSURE ON HIM TO RESIGN IN TO PACK HIS BAGS AND GET OUT OF DOWNING STREET IT PROBABLY WOULD END GEORGE OSBORNE'S LEADERSHIP HOPES OF TAKING OVER THE TORY PARTY TO THIS IS AN ENORMOUS HIGH STAKES ROLL OF THE DICE FROM THIS POLITICIAN AND ONE LIKE YOU NEVER WANTED TO MAKE YOU
AND DID HE FINDS HIMSELF IN THIS SITUATION AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT OF COURSE MORE A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME LAURA KINSBERG DANIEL HANNON THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ON A BIG DAY FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE THE TIMES THE DAILY MAIL AND THE DAILY EXPRESS ALL USE THEIR FRONT PAGES TO HIGHLIGHT THE NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS WORKING IN BRITAIN FIGURES SHOWED A RISE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND LAST YEAR TO MORE THAN TWO MILLION THE DAILY MAIL SAYS DAVID CAMERON MAYBE HAGGLING OVER E.U. SMALL PRINT BUT THIS IS THE REAL ISSUE THE TIMES BELIEVES THE PRESSURE IS GROWING ON THE PRIME MINISTER TO DELIVER HIS PROMISE TO CURB BENEFITS WHILE FOR THE DAILY EXPRESS THEIR NUMBERS ARE FURTHER EVIDENCE BRITAIN NEEDS TO QUIT THE E.U. TO CONTROL ITS BORDERS
THE GUARDIAN SAYS THERE'S A MOUNTING FRENZY SURROUNDING THE E.U. DEBATE AND SOME PERSPECTIVE IS NEEDED IT ARGUES THAT IT WHEN IT COMES TO SECURITY MIGRATION CLIMATE CHANGE AND OPEN MARKETS EUROPEANS ARE SAFER STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS BECAUSE OF THE COMMON E.U. PROJECT BUT THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR NIGEL LAWSON WHOSE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THINKS MISTER CAMERON HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF SECURING FAR REACHING REFORM
WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH HE ARGUES THAT OUTSIDE THE E.U. WE WOULD HAVE A GENUINELY GLOBAL RATHER THAN A LITTLE EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE THERE IS CONTINUING SPECULATION ABOUT WHERE THE BORIS JOHNSON WILL BACK THE STAY OR LEAVE CAMP THE MAIL SAYS THAT HER RATTLED AS DAVID CAMERON SPENT FORTY MINUTES TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO SIGN UP TO THE REFERENDUM DEAL THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER MADE IT CLEAR HE'D OFFER HIM A SIGNIFICANT CABINET JOB IN THE NEXT RESHUFFLE MY WORST FEAR ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES IS THAT BOTH BORIS JOHNSON AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOES WILL BACK HER BRITISH EXCEPT
EMMA THOMPSON APPEARED TO SPEND THE DAY EATING PLENTY OF CAKE AFTER SHE FOUND HERSELF IN HOT WATER AFTER DESCRIBING BRITAIN AS A CAKE FILLED MISERY LADEN GREY OLD IRELAND WHY NOGGIN WOULD BE MADNESS TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE ACTRESS ACTRESSES PICTURED IN THE DAILY MAIL HAVING A SLICE OF CABBAGE O.K. HEATHROW SHORTLY AFTER FLYING INTO THE COUNTRY SHE'S ALSO SEEN ENJOYING A GIANT VICTORIA SPONGE WHICH THE SON DELIVERED TO HER HOME IN THE SUN CALLED HER CAKE RANT DELUDED BUT THINKS IT SUMS UP THE POINT OF VIEW OF MEN WHO WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U.
THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND NOW I'M REALLY SORRY ANYONE WHO CAN MAKE A GOOD CUP OF TEA
JAMIE STOP HENRI AND WOULD BE ON MY MAN
LIKE TAKING BREAD TO THE TOP OF THE
A GRAND RIDE BACK THOUGH I KNEW BIG AND GET HER A HUNDRED DOORSTEPS OF AN OLD MISERY
CAM IN THERE WE GET IT INSIDE YOU BOY IN THE FAMOUS HOVIS AD AN ATMOSPHERIC BLAST FROM THE PAST THAT IS HOW IT USED TO BE BUT THE TRADITION OF TOAST AND TEA APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE
THE LATEST NATIONAL FOOD SERVICE SAYS THE AMOUNT OF BREAD EATEN IN BRITAIN HAS GONE DOWN BY FORTY PERCENT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND THERE'S BEEN A DRASTIC CHANGE IN TEA CONSUMPTION TO IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR USED EACH DRINK AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY THREE CUPS OF TEA A WEEK NOW IT'S DOWN TO EIGHT OR BEN MILLS RUNS A TEA AND TOAST VAN WHICH HE TAKES AROUND MUSIC FESTIVALS AND HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NOT THE BEST NEWS FOR YOUR BUSINESS

NOT MUCH YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A LEEDS STATED THIS MORNING HE'S A BISHOP TOM BUTLER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY TO THE GENERAL SYNOD WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY IT FOCUSES ON LAST MONTH'S MEETING OF THE PRIMATES FROM AROUND THE ANGLICAN COMMUNION AND BRINGS HOME WHAT A ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS THAT MEETING MUST HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY ARCHBISHOP HOSTING A MEETING IN HIS CATHEDRAL IN CANTERBURY
AS IS WELL KNOWN FOR SOME YEARS THE COMMUNION HAS BEEN DIVIDED IN ITS APPROACH TO HUMAN SEXUALITY PARTICULARLY SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS THE DIVISIONS ARE DEEP AND DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY'RE PERCEIVED TO BE WANT A PRINCIPLE
ON THE ONE HAND LOYALTY TO A BIBLICAL TEACHING GENERALLY NEGATIVE TO HOMOSEXUALITY ON THE OTHER A DEEP COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL HUMAN RIGHTS NOW MOSTLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN WESTERN SOCIETIES
THINGS CAME TO A HEAD LAST JUNE WHEN THE GENERAL CONVENTION OF THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN AMERICA OR TO THEIR DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE SO AS TO BE GENDER NEUTRAL GAY MARRIAGE WAS APPROVED
THE REACTION TO THIS PARTICULAR FROM AFRICAN CHURCH LEADERS WAS HOSTILE AND GIVEN THIS THE ARCHBISHOP MUST HAVE BEEN MIGHTILY RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE PRIMATES SHOWED UP FOR HIS MEETING IN CANTERBURY AND ALL BUT ONE STAYED TOGETHER UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK BUT THERE WERE STRESSFUL MOMENTS IN HIS ADDRESS TO SIT NOT THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THIS
ONE OF THE MOMENT IN WHICH WE VOTED WAS ON THE QUESTION WHEN ALL SEEMED LOST AS TO WHETHER WE WOULD WALK TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY AND IT DID SEEM LOST BUT THE VOTE TO WALK TOGETHER WAS UNANIMOUS IT WAS DONE BY OPEN VOTING HAVE RAISED HANDS AND WAS TOTAL HOWEVER DIVISIONS WERE PROFOUND AND REMAIN SIR SO WHY IS UNITY SO IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNION IF THE DIVISIONS ARE SO DEEP
THE ARCHBISHOP GOES ON TO SPEAK OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN ORDER AND DIVERSITY SAYING WHEN THE BALANCE IS WRONG AND EVEN MORE SO WHEN WE FEEL THREATENED LIKE A SHIP WITH A DYSFUNCTIONAL CREW HEADING FOR THE ROCKS DIFFERENT GROUPS OR STRIVE TO GRAB THE WHEEL SO THAT AS THEY SEE IT THEY MAY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY AND ONLY THEY KNOW THE WAY TO AVOID DISASTER THE REALITY IS THAT NONE OF THEM DO KNOW FULLY AND DISASTER IS ONLY AVOIDED BY UNITY WHICH RELISHES AND CELEBRATES THE DIVERSITY OF FREEDOM WITHIN BROAD LIMITS OF ORDER
HE GOES ON FOR THE FIRST TIME I EXPERIENCED THE BEAUTY OF THE COMMUNION WHEN ON ISSUES AFFECTING US VERY WIDELY THERE WAS A SHARING AN OUTPOURING OF MUTUAL SUPPORT
THERE YOU HAVE IT THE TENSION BETWEEN ORDER AND DIVERSITY FOR THE GOOD OF ALL AND IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE FOR THE CHURCH FROM THE VERY START WHEN THE APOSTLES PAUL PETER AND JAMES DISAGREED PROFOUNDLY UPON HOW MUCH OF TRADITIONAL JUDAISM GENTILES HAD TO ADOPT ON BECOMING CHRISTIANS
AND IN FACT I THINK THAT THAT BALANCE BETWEEN ORDER AND DIVERSITY LIES AT THE HEART OF ANY HEALTHY SOCIETY
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP TOM BUTLER IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN PAUL FIFE WAS STABBED TO DEATH IN LEICESTER BY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD MOHAMMED HERESY HE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER AS WAS TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD I MEAN JUGGY WHO WAS AT THE SCENE ALBEIT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE WHERE THE STABBING TOOK PLACE AND WAS SAID TO HAVE EGGED HIM ON
HIS CONVICTION CAME UNDER THE LAW OF JOINT ENTERPRISE WHICH IS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE SUPREME COURT HAS IT RULES TODAY ON A MEAN JOKE IS APPEAL THE LAW CAN ALLOW A SECONDARY OFFENDED TO BE CONVICTED OF THE CRIME CARRIED OUT BY THE PRIMARY OFFENDER IF YOU ENCOURAGED HIM AND FORCE ALL THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO PAUL FIGHTS WIDOW TRACY WHO HOPES THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT CHANGE THE LAW
I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LAW AND I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE DEVASTATING FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES LIKE OURS WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT CRIMINALS LIKE A MEAN JOKEY WOULD LITERALLY LITERALLY BE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER
SO YOU HOLD I MEAN JODIE AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF YOUR HUSBAND AS AS THE MAN WHO ACTUALLY TOOK THE KNIFE AND STABBED HIM MUHAMMAD HERESY
YES YES IF
I MEAN JOKE HE HADN'T HAVE BEEN THERE THAT NIGHT NEITHER WOULD PERCY
I MEAN JOKE IT WAS USING HER SEE AS A WEAPON
HE MEANS THE INTENDED TO HURT SOMEBODY THAT NIGHT AS HE PICKED UP THE KNIFE EARLIER ON AND IN HE'D HAVE HIS WORDS HE'D THREATENED TO SHOUT SOMEBODY YET AT THE TIME THAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS STABBED HE WAS NOT EVEN IN THE HOUSE
HE WAS AT THE FRONT DOOR WITH HER SEE HE WAS THREATENING TO SMASH A BOTTLE OVER PAUL'S HEAD HE THEN RAN WITH HER SEA AND THROUGH HER WEIGHT IS A SIM CARD THEY BOTH BLAMED EACH OTHER IN COURT AND NEITHER ONE STOOD UP IN COURT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
BUT THE PROBLEM THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL WITH THIS LAW IS THAT IT IT REMOVES THE IDEA OF AN INTENT TO KILL THAT IS NECESSARY FROM FROM THE SECONDARY OFFENDER IN THE CASE OF YOUR HUSBAND THAT IS I MEAN JODIE CAN YOU CAN YOU SEE WHY PEOPLE WOULD SAY
I CAN BUT I THINK I MEAN JOKEY WENT AT NIGHT WITH THE INTENT TO KILL SOMEBODY
AS HE PICKED UP THE KNIFE EARLIER IN THE NIGHT AND INTER THREATENED TO SHOUT SOMEBODY HE WANTED HE THAT WAS HIS INTENTION THAT NIGHT HE DID PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN DIDN'T HE HE DID PUT IT DOWN BUT HE WAS STILL THERE HE INTENDED THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF THIS APPEAL I MEAN DRUGGIES APPEAL HAD BEEN LIKE FOR YOU IT'S JUST DEVASTATING WE'VE HAD FOUR YEARS OF APPEALS
WE CAN'T MOVE ON AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO STOP I KNOW HAVE YOU COME FACE TO FACE WITH A MEAN JODIE CAUGHT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PROCESS YES YES WE HAVE AND WAS THERE ANY POINT
YOU WERE EVEN REMOTELY PERSUADED BY ANYTHING HE PUT FORWARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT NO THERE'S NOT A DOUBT NOT ADAPT HOW HAS HE COME ACROSS TO YOU IN COURT
ANGRY AND VIOLENT AT ONE OF THE APPEALS HE WAS SHOUTING AT THE JUDGE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE SAID SO IF THE APPEAL DOES GO IN HIS FAVOUR TODAY HOW WILL THAT MAKE YOU FEEL ANGRY AND DISAPPOINTED QUITE FRIGHTENED REALLY THAT HE COULD BE OUT ON THE STREET HE'S A VIOLENT PERSON AND
HE'D BE FRIGHTENED TO GO FACE TO FACE WITH HIM REALLY AND IT'S ALL IN THE FAT OF THE EVIDENCE AND FACTS IN THAT TRIAL IT'S QUITE EASY TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE EVIDENCE THAT
HE WAS THERE HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HE IS AS GUILTY AS HERS
TRACY FIVE THANK YOU WELL WE JOIN AND THE STUDIO BY SANDRA PAUL A SENIOR ASSOCIATE WITH THE LAW FIRM KINGSLEY NATURALLY SHE'S DEFENDED CASES WHERE CLIENTS WERE CONVICTED UNDER JOINT ENTERPRISE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND THESE CASES HAVE OFTEN BEEN CONTROVERSIAL ON THE ON THE SECONDARY OFFENDERS A POINT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE COURT SHOULD DO TODAY
THE COURT TODAY HE SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY MY VIEW TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THIS LAW IS TO BE APPLIED WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE AND IN PRACTICE WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN COURTS AND JURIES ARE ASKED TO DECIDE ON THE LIABILITY OF
SECONDARY OFFENDERS SO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY WHO DON'T ACTUALLY COMMIT THE OFFENCE BUT HE'S
PRESIDENTS THERE IS SAID TO HAVE AFFECTED WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY REFRAME IT SO THAT IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE CONVICTED YOU DO YOU THINK THE LAW'S TOO SEVERE AT THE MOMENT THE LAW'S TOO WIDE AT THE MOMENT IN MY OPINION SO ALLOWS A VERY LOW THRESHOLD FOR CULPABILITY SO UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE
PERHAPS THE OFFENCE WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE A PERSON TO HAVE AN INTENT TO DO SOMETHING TAKE SOME ACTIVE PART AS WE WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT IN CASES OF GUILT THIS LAW ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE CONVICTED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PERHAPS THEY SIMPLY THEIR PRESENCE THERE THAT THENCE ALTHOUGH ONLY INVENT IN THE CASE OF PAUL FIVE YOU HEARD HIS WIDOW TRACEY SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT SHE REGARDS THE SECONDARY FRIEND I MEAN JODIE'S BEING SO INFLUENTIAL THAT THE CRIME WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD HE NOT BEEN
I'M NOT INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE DETAILS OF THAT CASE AS I COULD THE PRINCIPLE OF THE IDEA THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY WIELDING THE MURDER WEAPON ED MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AT SOMEONE ELSE MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THEM THEY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ABSOLUTELY A SENSE OF JUSTICE IN LARGE PART IS
DETERMINED OR SATISFIED NOT BY RETRIBUTION BUT BY THE IDEA THAT THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN CONVICTED HASN'T DONE SOMETHING THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE PUNISHMENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE WHAT HAPPENS IN JOINT ENTERPRISE IS THAT IT MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO'S INTIMATELY INVOLVED AND THE PERSON WHO IS PERHAPS ON THE PERIPHERY OF WHAT HAPPENS
AND SO WHAT YOU FIND THEN IS THAT THERE IS A SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT PERSON TO RECEIVE HIS PUNISHMENT AND WHAT IN FACT THEY GET IN SO NOBODY GETS WHAT THEIR JUST DESERTS ARE ON THAT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE SERVING SENTENCES AT THE MOMENT AND AS A RESULT OF A JOINT ENTERPRISE CONVICTIONS WHICH SOME CAMPAIGNERS SAY A QUESTIONABLE WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THEM IF THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES TODAY TO CHANGE THE LAW
WE DON'T KEEP FIGURES ON THE APPLICATION OF THIS AREA OF FLOOR AND SO WE HAVE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE REGARDING IT AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS JOHN ENTERPRISE NOT GUILTY BY ASSOCIATION WHO SAY THEY'RE SUPPORTING SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE I THINK THAT PROBABLY THE FIGURE IS MUCH LARGER IN TERMS OF ITS APPLICATION FOR THOSE PEOPLE IF THE COURT MAKES THE DECISION TODAY AND
GIVES US CLEAR OF GUIDANCE OF COURSE WE WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THOSE CONVICTIONS AND IT MAY BE THAT SOME OF THOSE CONVICTIONS NEED TO BE REVIEWS AS TO WHETHER THEY'RE PROPER AND SOUND THEY COULD BE A WHOLE SERIES OF APPEALS POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF WHO APPEALS FOR HER ABSOLUTELY FINE YET THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AND REVIEW THOSE CASES AND WE ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS INVOLVED THROUGH THROUGH A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO REVIEW CONVICTIONS AS TO THEIR SAFETY SANDRA PAUL FROM KINGSLEY NOW PLEASE THANK YOU AT THE RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE PUBLISHED LATER THIS MORNING

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE IN BRUSSELS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN IN THE STUDIO IN LONDON
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE EIGHTEENTH OF FEBRUARY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON IS PREPARING TO HOLD INTENSIVE TALKS WITH LEADERS FROM EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AT A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS AS HE URGES THEM TO BACK HIS REFORMS DESIGNED TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE E.U.
BRITISH GAS PROFITS HAVE RISEN SHARPLY BUT PROFITS HAD ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA HAVE FALLEN AS THE PRICE OF WHOLESALE GAS CONTINUES TO TUMBLE
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TO FLY TO CUBA MARKING A HISTORIC TURNING POINT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND TIGHT SECURITY'S IN PLACE IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA WHERE AN EXPLOSION KILLED AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE YESTERDAY THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CATHY CLARKSTON DAVID CAMERON'S ATTEMPT TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS REACHING A CLIMAX AS LEADERS OF ALL TWENTY EIGHT NATIONS MEET FOR A SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
THE U.K.'S DEMANDS WILL TOP THE AGENDA OF THE FIRST SESSION OF THE TWO DAY GATHERING WHICH WILL ALSO DISCUSSED THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE'S MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD TUSK HAS WARNED THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AN AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME FOR MISTER CAMERON COULD LEAD TO AN INN NIGHT REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP AS EARLY AS JUNE FROM BRUSSELS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
A COMPLEX DEAL IS WITHIN REACH BUT NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED JUST ONE AMONG A NUMBER OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES COULD DELAY EVERYTHING ONLY WHEN THE TWENTY EIGHT NATIONAL LEADERS SIT DOWN TO NEGOTIATE FACE TO FACE WITH THE EXTENT OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS BECOME CLEAR
ANYTHING FROM PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO THE MEANING OF THE TERM EVER CLOSER UNION COULD PROVOKE LENGTHY DEBATE LAWYERS WILL BE ON HAND TO GO THROUGH THE FINE DETAIL
THE U.K. DEMAND FOR A CAST IRON GUARANTEE THAT THE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED BY DAVID CAMERON WILL EVENTUALLY BE ENSHRINED IN THE E.U. TREATIES IS ONE OF MANY DIFFICULT LEGAL OBSTACLES IN ADDITION MANY COUNTRIES REMAIN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO ANY SUGGESTION THAT CHANGES TO WELFARE PAYMENTS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY WITH THE U.K. IN MIND COULD BE ADOPTED BY OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THE FUTURE
SO THERE IS PLENTY THAT COULD STILL GO WRONG BUT THERE'S ALSO A FEELING THAT FURTHER DELAY WON'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER TO REACH A DEAL THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH DISCUSSION OF THE U.K. ISSUE WILL BEGIN THIS AFTERNOON CONTINUE LATE INTO THE NIGHT AND RESUME AGAIN TOMORROW MORNING
IT WAS JUST OVER THREE YEARS AGO THAT DAVID CAMERON PROMISED A REFERENDUM ON BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP SHOULD THE CONSERVATIVES WIN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ELECTION SAYING IT WAS TIME TO SETTLE THE MATTER ONCE AND FOR ALL
WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS COULD HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR EUROPE THE U.K. AND THE PRIME MINISTER HERE'S OUR POLITICAL EDITOR EUROPEAN SPEC
NEVER BEFORE HAS A EUROPEAN LEADER TRIED TO BROKER A DIFFERENT DEAL BETWEEN THEIR COUNTRY AND THE REST OF THE E.U. NEVER BEFORE HAS A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TAKEN THIS KIND OF RISK WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION HIS PARTY AND THE COUNTRY'S DECADES OF MEMBERSHIP
THE NICETIES OF THE DEAL WE'RE LIKELY TO BE CONCLUDED IN THE NEXT THIRTY SIX HOURS MAY ENERGISE FEW VOTERS BUT THE VERY FACT OF A DEAL ITS CONCLUSIONS WILL BE THE FOUNDATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S ARGUMENTS TO PERSUADE US TO CHOOSE TO STAY
FOR THE MANY EURO SCEPTICS IN HIS OWN PARTY THE PRIME MINISTER'S AIMS WERE NEVER BOWLED OR BRAVE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY REMAINING IN THE UNION IN THE REFERENDUM EXPECTED AT THE END OF JUNE BUT NUMBER TEN'S BIGGER PRIORITY IS THE MILLIONS OF VOTERS YET TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS FOR DAVID CAMERON THIS IS A FIGHT HE CHOSE AND A BATTLE HE CAN ILL AFFORD TO LOSE
BRITISH GAS HAS REPORTED A SHARP RISE IN PROFITS UP LAST YEAR BY THIRTY ONE PERCENT TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS BUT ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA SAW PROFITS FALL BY TWELVE PERCENT TO ONE POINT FOUR SIX BILLION POUNDS BECAUSE OF LOWER WHOLESALE GAS AND PA PRICES CEDRIC AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IAN KHAN TOLD US DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS WERE BEING TREATED FAIRLY AND HE INSISTED THAT THE ACTUAL COST OF GAS MADE UP ONLY PART OF THE BILL
WE HAVE PASSED ON THE MAJOR FALL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN GAS PRICES AND IN FACT THE FORTY ONE PERCENT FALL IN GAS PRICES WHICH I DO RECOGNISE HAS RESULTED IN A ABOUT A TEN PER CENT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TEN PER CENT FALL IN OUR COST OF GAS IN THE BILL AND WE REDUCED PRICES LAST YEAR BY TEN PER CENT AND BEFORE THE WINTER SO WE ARE DO WE ARE PASSING
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE AN HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS MARKING A TURNING POINT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AFTER MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY OF HOSTILITY WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS WILL ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT MISTER OBAMA WILL TRAVEL TO HAVANA AS PART OF A WIDER TRIP TO LATIN AMERICA HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
WHEN AIRFORCE ONE TOUCHES DOWN IN HAVANA IT'LL HAVE BEEN A THREE HOUR FLIGHT FROM WASHINGTON THAT IT'S TAKEN OVER HALF A CENTURY TO MAKE BUT THE SPEED WITH WHICH THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS THAWED HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF BREATHTAKING
IT WAS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO THAT PRESIDENTS HAVE BARBER AND RAUL CASTRO SAID THEY WANTED TO PUT THE HOSTILITY OF THE COLD WAR BEHIND THEM LAST SUMMER THEY RESPECTED EMBASSIES REOPENED IN WASHINGTON AND HAVANA AND EARLIER THIS WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT INSTEAD OF THERE BEING THE OCCASIONAL CHARTER FLYING INTO CUBA FROM THE U.S. COMMERCIAL AVIATION WOULD RESUME WITH ONE HUNDRED AND TEN FLIGHTS A DAY FROM ACROSS AMERICA TO THE CARIBBEAN ISLAND
THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE RELATIONS ARE COMPLETELY NORMALISED THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY WHO THINK THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE TOO FAR TOO QUICKLY
TIGHT SECURITY REMAINS IN PLACE OF OWN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL ANKARA OR DAY AFTER AN EXPLOSION KILLED AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE AND WOUNDED MORE THAN SIXTY OTHERS NO GROUP HAS ADMITTED TO CARRYING OUT THE BOMBING YOUR LAB REPORTS
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE JUST RELEASED SO IS THE LARGE BLAST OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CAR BOMB AS A TARGETED BUSES CARRYING MILITARY PERSONNEL IN THE EVENING RUSH HOUR
THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF DEADLY ATTACKS AND TURKEY THAT HAVE BEEN BLAMED MOSTLY ON KURDISH REBELS AND THE ISLAMIC STATES GROUP AND IT COMES AT A TENSE TIME AS THE SECURITY FORCES CARRY OUT LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS AGAINST KURDISH MILITANTS IN THE SOUTH EAST AS THE COUNTRY GETS DRAWN EVER DEEPER INTO THE WAR IN NEIGHBOURING SYRIA
A REPORT HAS REVEALED THAT SOME NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE TEAMS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE INSPECTORATE OF CONSTABULARY WARNS THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IS AT RISK BECAUSE OFFICERS ARE HAVING TO CARRY OUT DUTIES AWAY FROM THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS REFORMED POLICING TO MAKE IT MORE PROFESSIONAL AND LESS BUREAUCRATIC
THE SUPREME COURT IS DUE TO GIVE ITS JUDGEMENT THIS MORNING ON THE CONTROVERSIAL PRINCIPLE OF JOINT ENTERPRISE IN A RULING THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROSECUTIONS AND ENGLAND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND THE LAW MEANS DEFENDANTS CAN BE CONVICTED OF ASSAULT OR MURDER EVEN WHEN THEY DIDN'T ADMINISTER THE FATAL BLOW
CAMPAIGNERS CLAIM THAT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE SERVING SENTENCES AS A RESULT OF UNJUST JOINT ENTERPRISE CONVICTIONS
TODAY'S CASE CENTRES ON AN APPEAL BY A MEANS YOGI HE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER AFTER ENCOURAGING HER FRIEND TO STAB A FORMER POLICEMAN PAUL FIFE HIS WIDOW TRACEY HOPES THE SUPREME COURT DOESN'T MAKE IT HARDER TO BRING A PROSECUTION UNDER JOINT ENTERPRISE
I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LAW AND I THINK IT WOULD BE QUITE DEVASTATING FOR THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES LIKE OURS WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT CRIMINALS LIKE MEAN JOKEY WOULD LITERALLY LITERALLY BE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER
REAL PASSENGERS IN SOUTH EAST ENGLAND FROM IN THE LEAST SATISFIED AND BRITAIN ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND RAIL TRAVELLERS WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES LISA HAPPILY REPORTS
ALMOST ONE IN THREE COMMUTERS EXPERIENCED DELAYS ON THEIR LAST TRAIN JOURNEY ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY AND NEARLY THREE AND FOUR PASSENGERS FELT THEY WEREN'T GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY SOUTH EASTERN TENS LINCOLN GREAT NORTHERN CAME BOTTOM FOR OVERALL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A BELLY OH GREATER ANGLIA ALL FOUR CARRY LARGE NUMBERS OF COMMUTERS
GRAND CENTRAL WHICH TOP THE TABLE WITH THE HAPPIEST CUSTOMERS AND WHOLE TRAIN'S A CLOSE RUNNER UP CARRY FEWER PASSENGERS MAINLY ON LONG DISTANCE LEISURE JOURNEYS THE CAMPAIGN GROUP WHICH SAYS OPERATORS NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO COMPENSATION WHEN THERE ARE DELAYS THE RAIL DELIVERY GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS TRAIN OPERATORS AND NETWORK RAIL POINTS TO A RECENT SURVEY BY ANOTHER WATCHDOG TRANSPORT FOCUS WHICH SHOWED OVERALL PASSENGER SATISFACTION HAS RISEN
THE FORMER ENGLAND RUGBY UNION PLAYER MATT DAWSON HAS URGED PEOPLE TO SIGN AN ONLINE PETITION CALLING FOR ALL CHILDREN UNDER ELEVEN TO BE VACCINATED AGAINST MENINGITIS B. HE'S REVEALED HOW HIS FAMILY ENDURED TWO WEEKS OF HELL AS HER SON SAM FAULT THE INFECTION MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED THE PETITION WHICH WAS SET UP AFTER A TWO YEAR OLD FABER BURDETTE DIED FROM MENINGITIS B.
SCIENTIST STUDYING A TINY SEA SNAIL HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT SWIMS USING THE SAME MOVEMENT AS FLYING INSECTS RESEARCHERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN EXAMINING THE WAY THE SO CALLED SEA BUTTERFLY MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH THE WATER AS JONATHAN WEBB EXPLAINS
THE SEA BUTTERFLY LOOKS LIKE A TRANSPARENT TO LATIMER'S SNAIL WITH SLIMY WINGS SPROUTING FROM THE OPENING OF ITS SHELL BUT INSTEAD OF USING THOSE APPENDAGES AS PADDLES LIKE MOST TYPES OF SWIMMING PLANKTON THIS TINY ANIMAL GENUINELY APPEARS TO FLY UNDERWATER
TRACKING ITS MOVEMENT IN MINUTE DETAIL RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WINGTIPS TRACE OUT A FIGURE OF EIGHT TO GENERATE LIFT JUST LIKE THOSE OF AN INSECT IT MAY NOT FLOAT BUT THE SEA BUTTERFLY DOES APPARENTLY SWIM LIKE A BEE
TINY CRITTERS LIKE THE SEA BUTTERFLY PLAY A BIG ECOLOGICAL ROLE MESSING TO THE OCEAN'S SURFACE DURING THE NIGHT AND TAKING LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON IN THEIR SHELLS TO THE SEA FLOOR WHEN THEY DIE SO UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY SWIM COULD HELP SCIENTISTS WORK OUT HOW BEST TO MANAGE OUR OCEANS
JONATHAN WEBB REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE MEETINGS HERE IN BRUSSELS TONIGHT ARE A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR THE UNITY OF THE UNION AND FOR THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM'S RELATIONS WITHIN EUROPE THAT'S WHAT THE MAN OVERSEEING BRITAIN'S RENEGOTIATION THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HAS TOLD ALL TWENTY EIGHT LEADERS
AND HE SAID THAT AFTER HIS MOST RECENT MEETINGS HE HAD TO STATE FRANKLY THERE IS STILL NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL REACH AN AGREEMENT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS REACH SOME SORT OF DEAL THAT IN DAVID CAMERON'S WORDS WE'LL SETTLE THIS EUROPEAN QUESTION IN BRITISH POLITICS
THAT IS QUITE A BIG ASK GIVEN THE DECADES THAT EUROPE HAS BEEN A RUNNING SORE IN BRITISH POLITICS IT'S WHAT PROMPTED DAVID CAMERON IN GENUINE JANUARY TWENTY THIRTEEN IN A SPEECH AT BLOOMBERG HEADQUARTERS IN LONDON TO SAY HE WOULD RENEGOTIATE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HOLD AN IN OUT REFERENDUM
COUNTRIES OR DIFFERENT THEY MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES WE CANNOT HARMONISE EVERYTHING
FOR EXAMPLE IT IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR NECESSARY TO CLAIM THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE SINGLE MARKET OR INDEED FULL MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES THE WORKING HOURS ARE BRITISH HOSPITAL DOCTORS TO BE SET IN BRUSSELS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR VIEWS OF BRITISH PARLIAMENTARIANS OR PRACTITIONERS
IN THE SAME WAY WE NEED TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE BALANCE IS RIGHT IN SO MANY AREAS WHERE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS LEGISLATED INCLUDING ON THE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL AFFAIRS AND CROSS
NOTHING SHOULD BE OFF THE TAPE
NOTHING SHOULD BE OFF THE TABLE WHAT IS LEFT ON THE TABLE IN WHAT ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE FINAL TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND WITH ME HERE IN A BUSTLE STUDIOS A EUROPE EDITOR CATCHER ADLER AND THERE SEEM TO BE QUITE A LOT CATCH ARE STILL LEFT TO BE NAILED DOWN THAT'S RIGHT SO I THINK IT'S QUITE USEFUL THOUGH AT THIS POINT HAD TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND TO LOOK AT WHAT WE EXPECT TO UNFOLD TODAY AND TOMORROW MAYBE THROUGH DIFFERENT PRISMS IS THIS
IF WE GET A DEAL GOING TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. WILL NO IT'S NOT IT'S GOING TO CHANGE ASPECTS OF BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. SO OF COURSE FOR DAVID CAMERON'S CRITICS AT HOME WHATEVER HE COMES UP WITH AT THE END OF THIS SUMMIT ALL NEXT WEEK IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT TO FINALISE THIS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN E.U. LEADERS IN THE ROOM FOR THEM THIS IS QUITE DRAMATIC ACTUALLY BECAUSE
WE MUSTN'T FORGET THAT WHILE DAVID CAMERON HAS TO SELL THIS DEAL AT HOME AND TO HIS OWN PARTY THESE LEADERS HAVE TO SELL THIS DEAL AT HOME AS WELL SO WHEN WE'VE HEARD THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE QUIBBLING OVER CUTTING Y. MIGRANT BENEFIT IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE WEATHER QUITE A LOT OF THEIR VOTERS REALLY ENJOY THIS ABILITY TO MOVE AND WORK FREELY THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY IF THEIR LEADER SAY SURE SELL ME DOWN THE RIVER FOR A FOUR YEARS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU MOVED TO THE U.K.
THAT'S THEIR PERSPECTIVE IF WE LOOK AT FRANCE AND THE PROBLEMS WITH PROTECTING THE CITY OF LONDON FROM EUROZONE LEGISLATION FRANCE AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GERMANY AS WELL WOULD SEE THIS AS
GIVING HER A SPECIAL DEAL TO THE CITY OF LONDON AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AT THE BANKING LOBBY'S NOT PARTICULARLY THRILLED ABOUT THAT AND IF YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT ON NANS HE STANDING FOR RE ELECTION AS PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR AND THE ECONOMY IS IN DIRE STRAITS SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO JUST HAND SOMETHING TO DAVID CAMERON SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE SOME PUSH PULL THE WILL THOUGH
HE'S THERE TO GET A DEAL AND FRANKIE JUST TO MOVE ON ON ALL SIDES WERE GIVEN THAT SORT OF POLITICAL PRESSURES ON DAVID IT'S HARD TO SEE HIM BUDGING MUCH SO ONE WONDERS ARE THEY PREPARED TO ACCEPT THAT AS A PRICE FROM THE EASTERN EUROPEANS POINT OF WE CUT OFF THEIR NOSE TO SPITE THEIR FACE IF THEY SELL IT WE'D RATHER YOU LEFT THE E.U. THAT THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WELL ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE OF BRITAIN LEAVE THE E.U. THE FREEDOM TO LIVE AND WORK IN THE U.K. DISAPPEARS PUFF LIKE THAT SO SO THAT WOULD BE NO GOOD AT ALL
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS OVER OVER THE RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS FOR THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES IN THE ROOM THEY WANT BRITAIN ON BOARD AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ALSO HEARING AT THE SAME TIME AS GIVES THESE DETAILS THE IDEA THAT EUROPE IS STRONGER TOGETHER AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AGAIN WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON AT THE MOMENT MASSIVE CRISES IN EUROPE THE MASS MIGRATION CRISIS EUROZONE SLUMPS AND JITTERS OVER RUSSIA
SO THIS FEELING THEY WANT BIG BRITAIN WITH ITS BIG ECONOMY AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ITS DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE THEY WANT THAT ON BOARD IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FINANCE AND ECONOMY SO THEY DON'T WANT TO LET BRITAIN GO BUT THERE ARE STILL THOSE FINAL DETAILS ANOTHER POINT THAT WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED SO OFTEN THAT WORRIES A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES IS A CONCERN ABOUT CONTAGION IF IT'S TOO EASY FOR THE U.K. TO GET THIS DEAL DERIDED AT HOME WORRIED ABOUT HERE AND IN THE REST OF EUROPE WE HAVE NINE LE PEN IN FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE TALKING ABOUT SHE WANTS
FOR EXIT NOW SO SHE WANTS THERE TO BE A REFERENDUM HELD IN FRANCE AS WELL AND EURO SCEPTICISM IS NOT SOMETHING PECULIAR TO THE UNITED KINGDOM IT WAS SPREAD ACROSS THE CONTINENT ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH COUNTRIES THAT BEFOREHAND WAS SO ENTHRALLED BY BY THE EUROPEAN UNION INCLUDING SPAIN
INCLUDING ITALY INCLUDING THE NEWER MEMBERS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE THEY TOO WANT TO FLEX THEIR NATIONAL MUSCLES AS WELL PARTICULARLY THE NEW CENTRE RIGHT GOVERNMENT IN POLAND AND THERE HE IS ALIGNED WITH DAVID CAMERON IMPORTANT TONIGHT SEVERAL BE THOSE BILATERAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THE MEAT THE LEADERS WILL GO ON INTO THE NIGHT AND THAT IS WHERE THE IRON OVER A LOT OF THESE ISSUES OH KAY AND SAID IS IT YOUR CALL BRIEFLY THAT WILL BUT I DON'T KNOW THIS TIME TOMORROW WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF THIS TIME TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE A
YOU KNOW HOW SLOWLY THINGS CAN MOVE IN BRUSSELS LIKE I ONE IS I THINK THE WILL IS TO GET A DEAL REMEMBER LISBON TREATY HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO VOTE TILL YOU GET THE ANSWER YOU WANT IT MAY NOT COME OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THEY COULD EASILY BE A NEW EMERGENCY SUMMIT ON THE U.K. DEAL CALLED NEXT WEEK IF NECESSARY
KATYA ADLER THANK YOU VERY MUCH WERE LISTENING TO THAT IS THE FORMER LABOUR PARTY LEADER LORD KINNOCK WHO WAS ALSO OF COURSE E. YOU COMMISSIONER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT THE DEAL THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED HERE AND BRUSSELS MATTERS OR IT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL PARTLY BECAUSE OF COURSE IT IS THE
FOCUS OF ATTENTION FOR TWENTY EIGHT DEMOCRACIES INCLUDING OUR OWN AND THE EFFECTS THEREFORE
A SEISMIC BOTH PRIMARILY FOR US OF COURSE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BECAUSE THE CHOICE IS NOT ABOUT THE DETAIL OF WHAT MISTER CAMERON HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING
THE CHOICE IN THE REFERENDUM IS WHETHER WE STAY IN OR COME OUT WHETHER WE JUMP OFF THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE U.K. IT'S ALSO GOT
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE UNION FOR THE REASON THAT CATCH IT JUST SAID IN IN THERE HER CONTRIBUTION AND THAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTAGION
CERTAINLY SPREADING AMONGST THE NATIONALISTIC ELEMENTS IN EACH OF OUR NEIGHBOURS AND FELLOW E.U. MEMBERS COUNTRIES I THINK PARTICULARLY OF THE FUNK IN IN FRANCE THE ULTIMATE HE WROTE FOR DEUTSCHLAND IN IN GERMANY AND THE POLISH HUNGARIAN ELEMENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO DRAW UP THEIR OWN GENDER OVER PARTIALLY OR HOLY
WITHDRAW SO THAT'S REALITY IS CONCENTRATING MINDS AND MAKING PEOPLE RECOGNISE
THE MASSIVE IMPLICATION OF COMPLETING SATISFACTORILY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT SUITS THE U.K. AND
SOLIDIFIES THE EUROPEAN UNION GENERALLY DO YOU THINK THE DETAILS OF THIS DEAL I'M GOING TO MICK CAN MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY THAT THE VOTE GOES IN THE U.K. WE PEOPLE TO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CHILD BENEFIT AND ITS INDEX ASIAN OR THEM IN WORK AND BENEFITS
THE SITUATION HAS BEEN PRODUCED
BY THE WAY IN WHICH MISTER CAMERON HAS APPROACHED IT SINCE THE BLOOMBERG SPEECH BUT MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT WAY BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN MEANS THAT THERE CERTAINLY ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL CAST THEIR VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM
ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER THEY THINK MY CAMERON HAS ACHIEVED HIS NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OR NOT TO THEM I WOULD SAY AND I THINK THIS IS A COMPLETELY ACCURATE HE'S SECURED BY DINT OF LOSING A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY
PRETTY MUCH WHAT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE SECURED THE VALUE OF IT IS CLARIFICATION IN VERY IMPORTANT AREAS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE REAL QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE
CONCENTRATE ON THOUGH IS WHETHER THOSE DETAILS ARE SO SUBSTANTIAL OR INSUBSTANTIAL AS TO PROPEL US TOWARDS ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN UNCERTAIN FUTURE IN WHICH OUR ECONOMIC STABILITY AND INDEED OUR POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE
HE'S HUGELY PUT IN RISK AND DIMINISHED BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE EXCLUDED OURSELVES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD'S BIGGEST SINGLE MARKET
OH KAY BUT PEOPLE REPORT BACK TO THAT BLOOMBERG SPEECH AND SAY LOOK YOU SAID THAT NOTHING SHOULD BE OFF THE TABLE AND THERE WERE PLENTY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT WHAT WHAT WHAT HE NEEDS TO SECURE HIS IS A REFORM OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH OF COURSE HE WAS SO DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH AND WHAT HE'S ENDED UP WITH IS SOMETHING REALLY VERY DIFFERENT AND THIS IS A WASTED OPPORTUNITY THIS WON'T SETTLE THAT QUESTION OF EUROPE IN BRITISH POLITICS THIS IS A TINKERING A WELL MY REMARKS ON THE OCCASION OF THE BROOM BURKE SPEECH WHERE THAT
IF DAVID CAMERON CONSIDERS THAT THIS WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE IN BRITISH POLITICS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME
THEN HE WAS MISUNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A MATTER OF CONTENTION IN SOME QUARTERS CONCERNED I THINK YOU'LL BE TAKING THE LEAF AND YOU WON'T HEAR ME SAYING THIS VERY OFTEN BUT TAKE A LEAF OUT OF THEIR BOOK WRITTEN BY MISSUS THATCHER WHEN SHE WAS PRIME MINISTER HER COMMITMENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS VERY FIRM
THE COMMISSION THAT SHE GAVE TO OUR CIVIL SERVANTS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES INSIDE WHAT WAS THEN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WAS GET THE BEST POSSIBLE DEAL AND OF COURSE
SIGNIFICANT DEALS AND CHANGES WERE SECURED BY MEANS OF NEGOTIATING STRENUOUSLY FIRMLY FAIRLY FROM THE INSIDE AND GETTING THOSE DEALS SO IF IT'S REFORM THAT WE ARE AFTER THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF CHANGE AND REFORM IT'S REFORM WENT AFTER YOUR BETTER DOING IT
AS A VERY VERY ENGAGED PARTNER RATHER THAN THE POTENTIAL DIVORCEE BUT THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION WITH THE THE HAND THAT MISTER CAMERON HAS DEALT
FOR HIMSELF AND INSOFAR THAT COULD SECURE A CHANGE I THINK HE'S PROBABLY DOWN AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED IN THOSE CONDITIONS
IF YOU DO U.K. VOTES TO LEAVE WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS FOR BRITAIN AND INDEED FOR YOUR
OH IT WOULD BE APPALLING FOR BRITAIN NOT LEAST BECAUSE I JUST GIVE YOU WHEN FIGO APOLOGISE FOR YOU SWING THESE FIGURES BUT THESE CAN ENTIRELY ACCURATE FIGURES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ENVISAGE WHAT THE PROSPECT IS WE SELL FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL OUR EXPORTED GOODS TO THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY SELL
LESS THAN NINE PER CENT OF ALL THEY'RE EXPORTED GOODS TO US NOW IN THE EVENT OF US BEING OUTSIDE THE UNION AND THEREFORE OUTSIDE THE SINGLE MARKET PEOPLE HAVE ONLY GOT TO MEASURE FIFTY ONE PER CENT OUR NEED FOR THEM
NINE PER CENT THEY NEED FOR US TO SEE WHO WOULD HAVE THE PREDOMINANT IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THIS WOULDN'T BE CHARITY WEEK THAT'S FOR CERTAIN SO THE IMPLICATIONS JUST ON THE ECONOMIC GROUNDS
WITH THE JOBS THE INWARD INVESTMENT WE TAKE OVER HALF OF ALL THE IN INWARD INVESTMENT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE SINK FROM HARTLEY THEN I'VE GOT A STRONG FINANCIAL SECTOR
CHANGE ONE PART OF THAT EQUATION AND THE FUTURE IS A LEAP IN THE DARK FOR THE REST OF THE UNION THEY WOULD BE LOSING A VERY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC POWER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IF WE WERE TO PULL OUT
BUT OF COURSE WE'VE GOT A SURPLUS IN OUR IN OUR TRADE WITH THE REST OF THE UNION
ON SERVICES A SEVENTEEN BILLION SERVICE RIGHT NO IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES THERE MAYBE ELEMENTS IN SIDE THE REST OF THE UNION THAT WOULDN'T BE TOO SAD IF WE WERE IN DIFFICULTY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT WE NEED THEM MORE THAN US CONNECT THEIR PROBLEMS AND
THE CHANGE WOULD BE SEISMIC AND IT COULD NOT BE POSITIVE
LORD KINNOCK THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT ON YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMME WE HEARD ABOUT A NEW SCHEME TO GIVE INTENSIVE ONE TO ONE HELP TO THOSE CONSIDERED TO BE AT HIGH RISK OF CAUSING SERIOUS HARM THROUGH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN VIOLENT TOWARDS THEIR PARTNERS
THERE ARE ALREADY CHARITIES OFFERING GROUP SUPPORT TO MEN TO TRY AND CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ONE MAN WHO JOINED A GROUP LIKE THAT AFTER BEING VIOLENT TOWARDS HIS WIFE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO USE HIS FIRST NAME PETE BUT HE IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING
MORNING COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WIFE BEFORE YOU HIT HER
YES I RIGHT I'VE BEEN WITH MY WIFE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE
THE INCIDENT WHERE A HITTER WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN I WOULD GUESS I WOULD CONSIDER MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HER A FAIRLY NORMAL WE DID USED TO HAVE QUITE HEATED ARGUMENTS OR ROWS THAT THEY NEVER
ESCALATOR TO ANYTHING MORE THAN THAN THAN THAT I GUESS WHICH WHICH MOST PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER FAIRLY NORMAL
AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE WAS THE INCIDENT WHERE I I STRUCK MY WIFE
AND AFTER THAT I GOT INVOLVED IN THE GROUP WORK CLINGS WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT INCIDENT TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN
SO I GOT HOME FROM WORK
WHAT ABOUT THAT WORK LIKE A LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO AND GOT EMBROILED IN A IN A ROW WITH MY WIFE WHO CLEARLY HAD A BAD DAY AT HOME SELFISHLY I GUESS I WASN'T INTERESTED IN IN HOW HER DAY HAD GONE I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN HOW MY DAY HAD GONE
WE STARTED SHOUTING THEN WE PUSHED EACH OTHER AND I THREW MY WIFE ON SUE
THE SOFA AND GOT ON TOP OF THAT AND PUNCHED IN THE FACE AND SHE ENDED UP WITH A WITH A BLACK EYE
YES YOU DID YEAH WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU HE SAID THAT YOU HAD ARGUMENTS BUT NOTHING THAT YOU CONSIDERED AT THE TIME TO BE IN HER BEYOND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN IN IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU LOOK BACK NOW THOUGH DO YOU THINK THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS
OH ABSOLUTELY I THINK
YOU KNOW IF I'M HONEST IF I LOOK BACK OVER OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS
I PROBABLY GOT QUITE CLOSE TO BEING VIOLENT AND JUST JUST NOT GOT THAT FAR AND I THINK IF I'D RECOGNISED THOSE BEHAVIOURS SOONER I'D HAVE PROBABLY THOUGHT THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY IN THE INCIDENT THEN WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SO YES I THINK THERE WAS A BUILD UP BUT THAT INCIDENT WAS A ONE OFF WAS IT YOU YOU PUNCHED HER AND THEN YOU WENT INTO
THAT THE SCHEME OR A PLAYSCHEME THE GAVE GROUP SUPPORT IT HAS IT EVER HAPPENED
NO NO I'VE ROWED WITH MY WIFE SINCE BUT IT'S NEVER ESCALATED TO THE POINT THAT IT DID IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE
THE SCENE AS IT HAPPENED I REALISED OF COURSE I REALISED THAT IT WAS WRONG BUT I REALISED THAT I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
AND AND THAT WAS WHEN I SAW HELP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS OUT THERE AT THE TIME THAT I SAW
AND THEN HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH WITH THE GROUP ALL THAT KIND OF WORK SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BASICALLY BUT I JUST HELPED ME I THINK YES WELL A BIT BUT I WAS ONE OF WEATHER
GIVEN GIVEN THAT YOU REALISED SO QUICKLY WHAT YOU DONE WAS WRONG WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO FIND THAT HELP WHERE THAT YOU WERE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO WHO WHO WOULD HAVE TURNED A CORNER AFTER THAT ANYWAY OR WAS IT SOMETHING ABOUT THE SUPPORT YOU'VE GOT FROM THE GROUP THAT THAT REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE
I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY THAT THE GROUP WORK HELPED IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BUT HIM EMOTIONALLY
I KNEW WHAT I HAD DONE WAS WRONG BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR ME AND FOR OTHERS IS
I PROBABLY BLAMED MY WIFE A LOT FOR WHAT HAPPENED THAT THERE WASN'T A REAL ACCEPTANCE FROM ME THAT THAT I OWNED MY OWN BEHAVIOUR
I THINK WHAT THE GROUP DID AND TO BE FAIR I DIDN'T ACTUALLY START THE GROUP WERE PROBABLY FOR TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE INCIDENT BUT I WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUP COS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF CONTACT I THINK WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF BEING ON THE GROUP AND HAVING TO TALK OPENLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT SINCE THE INCIDENT
AND THEN TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE GROUP IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS DO YOU EITHER VERY QUICKLY RECOGNISE THAT YOU'RE THE PROBLEM AND THAT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR YOU YOU'RE IN DENIAL YOU'RE SAYING IT WAS USEFUL IT WAS USEFUL OR VALUABLE TO HAVE TO WAIT TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE YOU COULD GET TO THAT GROUP BECAUSE WE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO GET TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT STRAIGHTAWAY
IT'S THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS I WAS PROBABLY CRAVING BEING ON THAT GROUP FOR THE ENTIRE TIME BUT PART OF THE PROCESS WAS THAT EVERY WEEK I WAS IN CONTACT WITH
WITH MIKE HE WAS RUNNING THE GROUP AT THE TIME AND I AND I THINK BECAUSE THERE WAS A LARGE WAITING LIST FOR THE GROUP BACK THEN IT WAS ABOUT DEMONSTRATING THAT I WAS COMMITTED TO GOING ON THAT PROGRAMME SO ALTHOUGH I WASN'T ACTUALLY ON THE GROUP THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING EVERY WEEK
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE BEING ON THE GROUP BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF HOW I BEHAVED AND WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO EVERY WEEK IF THAT MAKES SENSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE MEDICATION SO YES I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUP SOONER BECAUSE ONCE I GOT ON TO THE GROUP
OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT MADE FOR ME PERSONALLY WAS HUGE AND I WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY WAITING TO GO ON THE GROUP
PETE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US THIS MORNING
IT'S NOT TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT TIME FOR SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY RICHARDSON IS HAS IT THIS MORNING GARY MORNING SO I'M ALMOST TEMPTED TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION WHO'S GOING TO HAVE A TOUGHER TIME IN EUROPE TODAY DAVID CAMERON OR MANCHESTER UNITED

TO US BEST OTHER THINGS PLAYER PERFORMANCE WILL DAME EST JOURNALISTE KEY FOR NEW DAY HAS BEEN TELLING ME MORE
YOU ACTUALLY SAID THAT HE HATED WHEN PEOPLE CALLED IT THE MONEY BOMB METHOD BUT THAT'S REALLY THE EASIEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT THEY USE A LOT OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS YOU SHALL RECRUIT PLAYERS TO SCOUT PLAYERS SO THEY USE THAT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AS MUCH AS THEY DO YOU WOULD BE YOUR ORIGINAL SCOURING SO THEY LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE CREATING CHANCES IF IT IS THAT'S ENOUGH SENSE OF PLAYER AT HOW MANY SAY SHOTS UNTIED THAT THEY HAVE STUFF LIKE THAT
FIND THE PLAYERS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE THEY RECRUITED A LOT OF PLAYERS BEFORE THERE'S IN THE JANUARY SAYS WINDOW THE FUNNY THING WAS THAT WHEN HE CAME IN
AND THEY WENT AND WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP MANAGER WON THEM THE CHAMPIONSHIP RESIGNED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T HE COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT THAT WAS THE WAY THEY THEY MANAGE THE CLUB THERE BUT HE HAD TO RECRUIT PLAYERS USING STATISTICAL NELSON'S SO SHOULD THE GUYS WON THEM THE CHAMPIONSHIP TO GET THEM JUST FOR THERE YOUR ENDING YOUR COLLEAGUE HE RESIGNED AND THE SUMMER WAS A NEW COACH WHO IS GOING TO BE IN CONTROL NOW IT'S AMAZING THOUGH THAT THE TEAM WERE ONLY FORMED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THEY'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS

THANKS GARY FELL IN OUR TIME IS COMING UP AFTER NINE LET'S FIND OUT WHAT MELVYN BRAGG HAS IN STORE FOR US THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING MELVIN I'M MICHELLE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT ROBERT HOOKE SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE TO SEVENTEEN OH THREE IN THE SIXTEEN FIFTIES IN OXFORD IN A FEW YEARS LATER IN LONDON THERE WAS A CONSTELLATION OF BRILLIANT MEN WHO LIFTED SIGNS THEN CALLED NATURAL PHILOSOPHY INTO THE ENLIGHTENMENT THEY INCLUDED CHRISTOPHER WREN ROBERT BOYLE
WARDEN WILKINS AND LATER ON ISAAC NEWTON AND ROBERT HOOK HE IS NOW THE LEAST KNOWN YET IT WAS AN UNPARALLELED IN UNPARALLELED INSTRUMENT MAKER OF MICROSCOPES AND TELESCOPES HE CHALLENGED NEWTON AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT LEAST IN DECLARING THAT HE HAD GIVEN THE IDEA FOR HIS GREAT WORK ON OPTICS AND HE HAD THE IDEA BUT NOT THE MATHEMATICS FOR GRAVITY AGAIN HIS WORD
IT NOW SEEMS HE MADE THE AIR PUMP WHICH MADE ROBERT BOYLE FAMOUS HE WORK EFFECTIVELY ON COMMENTS AND CLOCKED ON ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY HE WAS A KEY MAN AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY HE REDESIGNED LONDON INCLUDING FORTY CHURCHES AFTER THE GREAT FIRE AND YET HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN ECLIPSED UNTIL RECENTLY NOW WE ARE BEGINNING TO RECOGNISE AGAIN THE EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS RATHER SAD GENIUS
THAT'S ROBERT HOOK WE DAVID WOULDN'T PRODUCE PATRICIA FARAH AND ROBERT EYELET BUT BUSY BRUSSELS WITH SARAH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MELVIN AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER BECAUSE THERE GOING TO BE SOME RAIN AND SLEET AROUND IT'LL CLEAR TO THE SOUTH EAST BUT THERE WILL BE SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS ELSEWHERE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND BRUSSELS MICHELLE HUSSEIN IN THE STUDIO IN LONDON IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE AND KATHY CLARKSTON HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS DAVID CAMERON IS PREPARING FOR A CRUCIAL SUMMIT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS AND BRUSSELS AS HE ATTEMPTS TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U.
IF AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED IT COULD TRIGGER AN IN OUT REFERENDUM IN BRITAIN AS EARLY AS JUNE BRITISH GAS HAS REPORTED A SHARP RISE IN PROFITS THEY JUMPED BY NEARLY A THIRD LAST YEAR TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS BUT ITS PARENT COMPANY CENTRICA SAW PROFITS FALL BY TWELVE PERCENT TO ONE POINT FOUR SIX BILLION PINTS BECAUSE OF LOWER WHOLESALE GAS AND POWER PRICES
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TO MAKE HER MY VISIT TO CUBA IN THE COMING WEEKS THE BRIEF TRIP WILL MARK A WATERSHED FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA WHICH WERE ESTRANGED FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY
THE POLICE WATCHDOG HAS SAID THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD OFFICERS AND SOME FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE SPENDING AS LITTLE AS HALF THEIR TIME ON THE BEAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S REFORMED POLICING TO MAKE IT MORE PROFESSIONAL AND LESS BUREAUCRATIC
A SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT RAIL PASSENGERS IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ARE THE LEAST SATISFIED IN BRITAIN THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND REAL USERS FOR THEIR VIEWS OVERCROWDING POOR VALUE FOR MONEY AND DIRTY TRAINS WERE AMONG THE ISSUES RAISED
THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE ARE WE IN DANGER OF SLEEP WALKING INTO A TIME WHEN POLICE ARE NO LONGER SEEN OUT AND ABOUT ON THE BEAT THAT IS THE PROSPECT RAISED BY HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY BILLINGHAM IN A REPORT ON NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IN ENGLAND AND WALES A RISK OF OFFICERS BEING LARGELY CONFINED TO POLICE STATIONS AND ISOLATED
FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE SHE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MICHELLE HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE DID YOU FIND IN THE WAY THAT FORCES WILL HANDLING THE PROPORTION OF OFFICERS OUT AND ABOUT AND INSIDE STATIONS
WELL OVERALL JUST TO PUT THE REPORTING CONTEXT WHAT WE FOUND IS MOST FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE ACTUALLY VERY GOOD AT PREVENTING CRIME AT THE MOMENT SO THEY ARE GETTING AHEAD OF THE CURVE STOPPING STOPPING IT HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE COMMEND FORCES FOR THAT BUT WITH SCIENCE SOUNDING A WARNING ALARM TODAY REALLY BECAUSE WE SPOKE TO HUNDREDS OF POLICE OFFICERS DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INSPECTIONS AND MANY OF THEM TOLD US THAT RATHER THAN DOING THAT THE TYPICAL COMMUNITY BEAT POLICING THAT THEY WERE
TO DO THEY WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM COMMUNITIES AND DOING MUCH MORE WORK IN POLICE STATIONS SO IT'S A MIXED PICTURE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT ARE YOU SAYING IT'S ESSENTIALLY SORT OF ANECDOTAL WHAT YOU'VE GATHERED YOU HAVE NOT ASSESS THAT THE PROPORTION OF TIME THAT FORCES ARE SPENDING ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND AND IN AND IN THE STATIONS ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SAYING IN A REPORT TODAY IS THAT POLICE LEADERS ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR FRONT LINE POLICE OFFICERS ARE DOING IN THE DATA AROUND THIS IS REALLY QUITE POOR
AND SO SOMETIMES NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE OFFICERS ARE ASKED TO DO CRIME INVESTIGATIONS RATHER THAN ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO COMMUNITIES SNIP AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN THE BUD TO BE THE EYES AND EARS OF COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT ACTUALLY CHIEF CONSTABLES NEED TO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT PROPORTION OF THEIR TIME IS BEING SPENT DOING PREVENTATIVE WORK
HOW MUCH OF THEIR TIME IS DOING CRIME INVESTIGATION SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR RESOURCES WHERE THEY MOST NEED THEM AND MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IN THIS INSPECTION IS DIRECT FROM THOSE OFFICES THAT ARE DOING THEIR JOBS CLEARLY WE WERE ON THAT O.K. NATION AND THEY'RE ESTIMATING SOME IN SOME PLACES
UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR TIME AS BEING SPENT OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEIR BED I'VE BEEN THERE THE MUCH BIGGER BACKGROUND TO ALL OF THIS IS THAT FORTY THOUSAND POLICE POSTS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE TWENTY TEN SO THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY IN A FEW OFFICERS TO GO AROUND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER POLICE OFFICERS AND PCSOS AND MEMBERS OF POLICE STAFF SINCE TWENTY TEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT THERE WAS A REPRIEVE FOR POLICING IN THE AUTUMN THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S STATEMENT
THE AMOUNT OF CUTS THAT WERE ANTICIPATED BEING MADE ARE NOTHING LIKE THE SCALE THAT FORCES WERE PANNING FOR SO THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CHIEF CONSTABLES TO REASSESS THE PLANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CUT EVEN DEEPER AND FURTHER INTO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING TO STEP BACK AWAY FROM THOSE PLANS AND TO TAKE A PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO POLICING STOPPING CRIME IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU ASK
PEOPLE ON THE STREET WHAT WOULD THEY RATHER SEE HAPPENING A CRIME NOT HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WILL ALL TELL US THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE THE ABSENCE OF CRIME O.K. WELL ONE OF THE FORCE'S FOUND BY YOUR REPORT TO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT IN FACT ONE OF THE WORST PERFORMING FORCES WAS ESSEX POLICE AND ITS DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE MATHEW HORNE IS IN A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO BEING FOUND BY THIS REPORT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST PERFORMING FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ON ONE ON THE PARAMETERS THAT WAS LOOKED AT
EXCEPT THAT WE REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER PUSH BACK ON THAT AND THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE THIS REPORT I WOULD CERTAINLY DISPUTE THE FACT THAT WE'RE ONE OF THE WORST I MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH SERIOUS AND ORGANISED CRIME AND THAT
RELATES TO HOW A LOCAL OFFICERS ARE COMMUNITY OFFICERS DEAL WITH IT WE WERE FOUND TO BE GOOD WE'VE BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFICIENT AND WE'VE GOT A GOOD IN THE LEGITIMATE INSPECTION SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THAT PREMISE YOU WERE REQUIRED YOU WERE REQUIRED TO EIGHT YOU REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT OF PREVENTING CRIME AND ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR YOU REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT INVESTIGATING CRIME IN MANAGING OFFENDERS YOU WERE RATED INADEQUATE AT PROTECTING VULNERABLE PEOPLE
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT RELATES TO A PREVIOUS REPORT THAT WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT BEFORE YOU KNOW BUT SET THAT IN CONTEXT OF THREE THOUSAND FEWER ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR INSTANCE LAST YEAR WITH SEVEN HUNDRED FEWER OFFICES I THINK WE WELCOME THE DEBATE IN THIS IS NOT ME PUSHING BACK ON THE REPORT IN ANY WAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT DEBATE WE'VE INCREASED OUR CAPABILITY TO INVESTIGATE DIGITAL CRIME WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THAT BEFORE NATIONALLY HAVEN'T WE
AND DOMESTIC ABUSE CHILD ABUSE THAT HAPPENS IN COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE THOSE OFFENCES BY NECESSITY SOME OF THE OFFICERS AREN'T ALWAYS THEREFORE ON PATROL SO WHEN AN OFFICER COMES ACROSS AN ARREST AND ACTUALLY MAKES A GOOD INTERVENTION AND THEN LOOKS AFTER THE VICTIM
THE REALITY IS THEY MIGHT NOT BE THEREFORE ON PATROL I ACCEPT WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT HOW WE KNOW WHAT TIME THEY SOMETIMES SPEND ON PATROL BUT ACTUALLY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THEM IS JUST AS IMPORTANT I DO KNOW THAT ON THE SPECIFIC POINT THAT SAY BILLINGHAM IS MAKING ABOUT CHIEF CONSTABLES NEEDING TO KNOW THAT THE PROPORTION OF THAT OF TIME THAT THEIR OFFICERS SPEND ON THE BEAT AND AND OUT IN THE COMMUNITY DO YOU KNOW THAT FOR YOUR FOURTH
I DON'T KNOW IT'S SPECIFICALLY WHAT I CAN DO IS TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON AND TELL YOU THE BRILLIANT WORKS I THINK WE NEED SOME TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO GET ROUND THAT I THINK WE WILL GET THAT WITH THE ADVANCES THAT WERE MAKING AROUND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE ENABLING OUR OFFICERS DO YOU KNOW THERE'S A HUGE LEGACY OF UNDER INVESTMENT IN I.T. THAT WE HAVE NOW WE MODEL EACH SHIP GOT TO TACKLE IT'S I DON'T I DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE YOU'D NEED A MINUTE GIVE ME A BIG CLOCK IN AND OUT WOULDN'T YOU HAVE POLICE STATIONS WHO OUGHT TO KNOW WHERE SHE'S CLOCKING ON CHECK IT OUT A CUSTODY ABOUT OR
RIGHT THEN YOU PIPED IN AND OUT OF WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING A VICTIM POINTS IT WILL HOW MUCH DO WE WANT MICHELLE HOW MUCH BUREAUCRACY TO WE WANT TO DEVELOP IN DOING THIS WE NEED SURELY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A VICTIM RINGS AS WE GET THERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEY GET A FIRST RATE SERVICE AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN I KNOW THAT THE OFFICERS OF ESSEX ARE DOING THAT I'M NOT JUST IN ESSEX AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE CAN'T GET BETTER OF COURSE WE CAN COME BACK TO SAY BILLINGHAM FOR HER FOR HER FINAL WHERE THERE DOING WHAT THEY CAN
WELL WE THINK THAT SIX JUST DOESN'T NEED TO DO MORE WITH SAID THAT IN OUR REPORT WE THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT CHIEFS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OFFICERS ARE DOING AT ANY ONE TIME AND WE THINK LIKE YOU MICHELLE FROM YOUR QUESTIONS IT IS IT ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT AND IT IS A BASIC EXPECTATION OR NOT BUREAUCRACY ON POLICE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE YOUR BUSINESS AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR STAFF ARE DOING SO HE BILLINGHAM HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY AND MATHEW HORNE DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF ESSEX POLICE THANK YOU BOTH
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO LINE THE TIME FRAME IS NOW PRETTY CLEAR ASSUMING A DEAL IS DONE TODAY OR AT LEAST OVERNIGHT IN BRUSSELS THERE WELL IN THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS BE A CABINET MEETING IN LONDON FOLLOWED BY AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WILL GET TO VOTE ON WHETHER THE U.K. REMAINS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WILL BE AN HISTORIC DECISION PERHAPS THE MOST HISTORIC ANY OF US WERE MAKING A LIFETIME EARLIER THIS MONTH NICK SPENT TIME WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE LEANING TOWARDS VOTING TO LEAVE NOW OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE HAS MET THE OTHER SIDE
SO IT'S LUNCHTIME AT ESSEX UNIVERSITY OUTSIDE COLCHESTER THERE'S A BAND ON THE STAGE TO ACCOMPANY THE SANDWICHES AND CHRIS
THIS PLACE TICKS ALL THE IN CROWD BOXES THE IN THE E.U. CROWD BETTY'S YOUNG EDUCATED AND PLUGGED INTO THE WORLD
DAISY AND EIGHTEEN HISTORY OF ART MY BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD BE
FINANCIALLY I THINK IT'S TOO RISKY A MEAL ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE
TO BE HONEST THAT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED I THOUGHT SHOULD EMPHASISE MORE THE PERCEIVED CULTURAL BENEFITS OF BEING IN A CLUB OF TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT NATIONS SO I TURNED TO HER FRIEND SO I AM RICKY I'M TWENTY YEARS OLD AND I'M STUDYING PHILOSOPHY RELIGION
I THINK WE SHOULD STAY IN IF AMERICA WERE TO SEE BRITAIN ARE NOT PART OF HE KNEW THEY WERE KIND OF SIESTAS A WEAKER ALLY
MAYBE NOT HAVE MUCH OF A GLOBAL INFLUENCE AS WE DO TOGETHER BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MULTICULTURALISM THAT'S WHAT'S MEANT TO BE IN PART SO ATTRACTIVE TO THE YOUNG ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS BY PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS FROM STRATHCLYDE UNIVERSITY A CLASSIC STEREOTYPICAL CORE REMAIN VOTER
IS A RELATIVELY RECENT UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SOMEBODY WHO IN TRUTH FEELS RELATIVELY HAPPY ABOUT IMMIGRATION QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH DIVERSE SOCIETY FOR THEM YOU'RE UP IS AN ATTRACTIVE PROSPECT SOMETHING THEY WISH TO EMBRACE THY AT LEAST ARE THE CORE SUPPORTERS OF THE REMAIN ARGH
RIGHT INTO COLCHESTER
FORGET THE TREATY OF ROME IT WAS THE INVASION OF THE ROMANS THAT BUILT THIS CITY THE FIRST CITY IN BRITAIN AND IT HASN'T PUT THEM ALL OFF THE CONTINENT ALL TYPES
SO THIS IS GOODY BARRETTE LAW FIRM THE OLDEST IN COLCHESTER FOUNDED THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO HAND WITH HER WHY CREAKY STAIRCASE TO PROVE IT
HELLO HI
THERE'S NOTHING ELDERLY HOWEVER ABOUT THE THIRTY SOMETHINGS SOLICITOR'S HERE TIM SCENE UP IN KATE'S TYPICAL OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WHITE COLLAR PROFESSIONALS THAT THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS WILL VOTE IN LARGE NUMBERS TO STAY IN THAT DEFINITELY I THINK THIS MEANT FAR MORE ADVANTAGES TO BEING PART OF A COLLECTIVE RATHER THAN BEING
AN INDIVIDUAL ISLAND OUT ON THEIR OWN BREAD THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THAT I SEEM TO FEEL THAT THE ARGUMENTS FOR STAYING IN ON SOUND MORE SOUND TO ME BUT SPECIFICALLY
WELL TRADE FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS SAID THAT IF WE DRAW WE WOULD HAVE TO MAYBE POSSIBLY AGREE ON NEW TRADE TARIFFS AND THAT WOULDN'T BE FAVOURABLE BECAUSE A GERMANY AND FRANCE MAY NOT GIVE US THE KIND OF TARIFFS THEY MIGHT HOLD THAT AGAINST US THE TRADE ARGUMENT
THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD SEEMS TO BE THE ONE THAT KEEPS COMING THROUGH FOR YOUR AGE GROUP I DEFINITELY AGREE AND I ALSO THINK IT'S SORT OF TAGGED ON TO THE KIND OF SAFETY IN NUMBERS
WE ARE ABLE TO BAND TOGETHER THE REST OF EUROPE AND TAKE ON AMERICA AN ASIAN MARKETS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO NEED TO STAY PART OF REALLY YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LESS POSSIBLE IF WE WERE TO LEAVE WITHOUT QUESTION
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT THE IN AND OUT CAMPAIGNS AGREE ON AND IT IS THIS ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE ARE UNDECIDED AS ONE
IN CAMPAIGNER PUT IT TO ME THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO VOTE WITH THE HEAD NOT THEIR HEART AND ONE HUGE FACTOR ENCOURAGING VOTERS TO DO THAT
HE'S FEART I'M HEADING THROUGH CALLED CHESTER'S LANES NOW TOWARDS THE OFFICES OF FEVER
CREATIVE DIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY IF I WERE SINGLE AND TWENTY ONE IT WOULD PROBE
BUT I'M NOT THAT'S ALEXANDER SOME THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OLD THE CLIENT SERVICES LEAD AT FEVER I'VE GOT A THREE YEAR OLD SON SO IT'S
BECAUSE OF FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN IS FEAR FOR THE FUTURE FOR YOUR SON YEAH IT'S THE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN IS THE FEAR OF WHAT CRASH IT CAN HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY AND SECURITY
AND I DON'T RETAIN A REST YOU'RE GOING INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO PAN
THERE ARE LOTS OF GREAT SAYING I WILL BE FINE WE'LL COPE WE'LL SEE IT THROUGH COME TOGETHER AND IT'S I I JUST IT WORRIES ME HE'S TOO MUCH OF A REST
RISK YOU'LL BE HEARING A LOT OF THAT WORD IN THE COMING MONTHS IT'LL BE A CENTRAL PART OF THE MESSAGE PUT OUT BY THE IN CAMPAIGN YES THEY'LL CHAMPION WHAT THEY SEE AS THE BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP BUT THEY'LL ASK YOU TO WEIGH UP WHETHER YOU'RE PREPARED TO RISK THOSE
WITH A LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WILL DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS REFEREE
MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE THE PHOTOGRAPH OF TWO YEAR OLD FABER DEBT IN HER HOSPITAL BED SHORTLY BEFORE SHE DIED HER TINY BODY ALMOST ENTIRELY COVERED WITH A RASH CAUSED BY MENINGITIS HAVE SPARKED AN IMMENSE REACTION NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A PETITION CALLING FOR ALL CHILDREN TO BE VACCINATED
THE PROGRAMME TO VACCINATE BABIES BEGAN LAST SEPTEMBER AND I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR NOLEEN ENIS WHO'S A PAEDIATRIC CONSULTANT AT SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL PADDINGTON AND AN ADVISER TO THE CHARITY THE MENINGITIS RESEARCH FOUNDATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU HELLO GOOD MORNING WOULD YOU SUPPORT A CALL FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE VACCINATION PROGRAMME FOR BABIES WILLOW WOULD SUPPORT A CALL FOR THE
FOR WHOLE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF VACCINATION AGAINST MANY GOOD HAD CEASED TO REMAIN VERY HIGH IN THE MINDS OF THE GOVERNMENT WE DO KNOW THAT LAST YEAR THEY MADE A FANTASTIC ME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE HIS VACCINATION TO BABIES AND ALTERED TO INTRODUCE THE QUAD VAILA VACCINE FOR TEENAGERS THIS IS FANTASTIC
AFTER ALL NEW VACCINES I INTRODUCED THERE HAS TO BE A PERIOD WHERE THE IMPACT IS REASSESSED AND ACTUALLY WEAR THAT THESE BACK TO YOU ARE BEING CARRIED AND WHEN I SAY WHERE I MEAN IN WHICH POPULATIONS
TYPICALLY MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE IS CARRIED IN THE NOSE AND THROAT MAINLY OF TEENAGERS AND SO OFTEN VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS HAVE STARTED WITH THE TEENAGERS TO TRY AND ERADICATE THE CARRIAGE SO WE STARTED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE RISK GROUP YES AND THERE WAS SENSE IN THAT BECAUSE THE TEENAGERS WERE PART OF A DIFFERENT CAMPAIGN TO ERADICATE THE W. WHICH IS CIRCULATING IN THE COUNTRY
AND ALSO THE BABIES ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND THE TWO WAYS OF VACCINATING THE COUNTRY YOU CAN EITHER SAY YOU GAVE EACH OTHER VACCINATION PROTECTS THEM DIRECTLY OR YOU CAN VACCINATE THE GROUP WHO CARRY THE BACTERIA MOST AND THEN YOU GET INDIRECT EFFECTS WHERE YOU ALSO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE THE YOU YOU GET THIS DISEASE BY CATCHING IT OFF SOME ONE ELSE
AND SO I I REALLY DO SUPPORT THE PETITION TO KEEP THIS SUBJECT HIGH IN THE MINDS OF AND THE PETITION THIS PUT PETITION THE ONE IN THE WAKE OF THESE PHOTOS OF THE PHOTOGRAPH OF FABER DEAD SAYS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ROLL UP THE PROGRAMME TO ALL UNDER ELEVEN'S IS THAT THE RIGHT
CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'RE SUGGESTING AT IT I WAS THE ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT I MEAN IF YOU'RE GOING TO ROLL UP TO AN EMPTY SHOULD GO UP TO EIGHTEEN I THINK WE NEED SOME MORE INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THE VERY HIGH RISK GROUPS AND ACTUALLY HE'S CARRYING IT AS WELL AND THIS IS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THING FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU TARGET PEOPLE CARRYING IT YOU MAY ACTUALLY PROTECT HUGE NUMBERS OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN
O.K. I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THE YOUNG YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE MOST VULNERABLE SO WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE THE PARENT OF A TWO OR THREE YEAR OLD TOO OLD TO HAVE THIS VACCINATION WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WELL IF YOU'RE VERY ANXIOUS YOU CAN IT'S AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY YOU CAN JUST PAY AND HAVE IT DONE PRIVATELY AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST OH AYE VARIES FROM CLINT CLINIC BUT PROBABLY AROUND SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS VACCINATION WHICH IS VERY HIGH BUT THE COST IS ALSO VERY HIGH FOR A CHILD GETS IT
AND SO THERE WAS THERE WAS PERSONAL CHOICE NOW AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE VACCINE IS YOU CAN PAY AND GET IT AND OF COURSE WE REALLY WANT THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND TO DO THE RIGHT RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHO TO VACCINATE NEXT DOCTOR NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE FAMILY OF ELLIOT JOHNSON THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CONSERVATIVE PARTY ACTIVIST FOUND DEAD BY A RAILWAY LINE LAST SEPTEMBER
I'VE PERSUADED THE CORONER TO WIDEN THE SCOPE OF THE INQUEST INTO HIS DEATH SO THAT IT CONSIDERS ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WAS BULLIED BY PEOPLE WITHIN THE PARTY'S YOUTH WING RAY JOHNSON ELLIOT JOHNSON'S FATHER TOLD ME WHY HE WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE ORIGINAL REMIT THE CONDOR RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE POLICE WHICH WE BELIEVE DOCTOR BE VERY THOROUGH AT ALL IS IT ONLY WENT AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE EVENTS JUST PRIOR TO ELLIOTT'S DEATH RATHER THAN THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO HIS DEATH IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS BEFOREHAND AND
WE THEREFORE MADE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE CORONER TO SAY THAT THERE'S MORE TO THIS HERD IN MORTAR COULD LISTEN TO BUY THE CORONER OR CONNOR EXCEPT IT OUR ARGUMENTS AND HAS DECIDED WITH HER DRIVING HAVING AN INKWELL AN INQUEST ON THE SECOND OF MARCH SHE WILL HAVE A PRE INQUEST HEARING WHICH ALLOW US TO MAKE FULL LEGAL REPRESENTATIONS TO HIM AND HOW FAR BACK ARE YOU ASKING HIM TO GO
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET I HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T FULLY DECIDED THEIR STRATEGY WITH THAT WITH OUR LAWYERS BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY GOING BACK THE LEAST ONE MONTH AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT
THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS ELLIOTT HAD WITH MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WILL BECOME RELEVANT TO THE INQUIRY IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
YES THAT'S TRUE AND ALSO ONE THE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER ORGANISATIONS ASSOCIATED TO CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THE KEY POINT TO YOU IS THE ALLEGATIONS OF HOW HE WAS TREATED AND THE ALLEGATIONS OFF OF HIM BEING BULLIED
THEY'RE CERTAINLY YES WE BELIEVE THAT IT TOOK HIS OWN LIFE BECAUSE HE WAS BEING BULLIED BY PERSONS AND POSSIBLY ORGANISATIONS SURROUNDING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHAT WILL THAT MEAN THAT YOU WANT FROM THE THE PRE ENQUIRING THEN THE INQUEST ITSELF YOU YOU WOULDN'T YOU WOULD LIKE
THERE THE PEOPLE NAMED TWO TO BE ASKED FOR FOR STATEMENTS AND FOR THOSE TO BE RELEVANT
WE'RE ASKING THE CORONER TO WIDEN HIS SCOPE OF THE INQUEST TO BRING FORWARD WITNESSES WHO WE BELIEVE HAVE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER AND WHO ARE THOSE WITNESSES FOR YOU
I CAN'T REALLY SAY AT THIS STAGE TO BE HONEST THAT'S STUCK TO THE CORONER TO DECIDE WHO THE WITNESSES WILL BE BUT YOU'VE PUT NAMES FORWARD YES CERTAINLY AND AT THE SAME TIME WE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY'S OWN INQUIRY THE INDEPENDENT INQUIRY THAT THEY HAVE ORDERED IN INTO THE CASE OF YOUR SON'S DEATH HOW FAR HAS IT GOT
WE'RE INSURED BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TAKE PART IN THAT INQUIRY THAT ITS SO CALLED INDEPENDENT INQUIRY BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S FUNDED BY THE CAN SERVE TO PARTY AND THE TERMS OF REFERENCE ARE SET BY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IT'S HARDLY WHAT I WOULD CALL INDEPENDENT INQUIRY SO YOU'VE DECIDED NOT NOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT AT ALL
YES EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO LOOK INTO THE FACTS SURROUNDING YOUR SON'S DEATH NO WE BELIEVE THAT THE CORONER'S INQUEST IS TRULY INDEPENDENT ARENA IN WHICH WE CAN LOOK INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY SON'S DEATH
AND HAVE THE HAT HAS THE INQUIRY THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAVE THEY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH YOU HAVE THEY ASKED YOU TO TO MAKE A SUBMISSION
THEY DID ORIGINALLY BUT THEY WANTED TO MYSELF AND MY WIFE TO BE INTERVIEWED INDEPENDENTLY WE WE DECIDED THAT WASN'T THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS AND WE DECLINED MY TIPSY OR PLAY NO FATHER FURTHER PARTED SO THEN THIS INQUEST IN THE PROCESS OF THE CORONER WILL OVERSEE DO YOU REGARD THAT AS YOUR BEST CHANCE OF GETTING SOME ANSWERS TO ELLIOTT'S DEATH
YES THE CORONER IS A TRULY INDEPENDENT COURT SO WE WILL USE AND HOPEFULLY USE UTILISED HIS SERVICES TO GET THAT THE PROPER INDEPENDENT INQUIRY RAY JOHNSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW FIVE MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER DAYS WEEKS MONTHS TALKING ABOUT WHAT TODAY'S NEGOTIATIONS MEAN FOR BRITAIN WHETHER THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE REST OF EUROPE I'M JOINED HERE IN A BRUSSELS STUDIO BY RYAN HEATH IS ASSOCIATE EDITOR FOR POLITICO BASED IN BRUSSELS AND BY EMMA HOGAN WHO'S YOUR CORRESPOND FOR THE ECONOMIST MORNING TO PICK LET'S TALK ABOUT
CONTAGION BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORD THAT SEEMS TO BE CROPPING UP WITH AFFECTIVE LEE EMMA HOGAN
OTHER COUNTRIES SAY HOLD ON A SECOND IF BRITONS HAVING THAT I WANT A BIT OF IT TOO YEAH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THE BIG WORRY HERE IN BRUSSELS IN TERMS OF HOW HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS SETTLEMENT TO SAY THAT IT'S EITHER MAKES BRITAIN EXCEPTIONAL OR HOW MUCH IS IT GENERAL IN TERMS OF WHICH OTHER COUNTRIES WILL WANT TO INDEX CHILD BENEFITS TO HAVE TWO COUNTRIES IT THEMSELVES
AND I SUPPOSE THE CRITICAL THING THERE OF COURSE IS BECAUSE IT WE MIGHT BE TEMPTED THINK WELL LOOK THIS IS A CLUB EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RULES THOSE WHO ARE PAYING THE CHILD BENEFIT WANT THAT DEAL BUT THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING AT THAT ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WITH IN MIGHT BENEFIT SO IT SEEMS THAT IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE IT APPLIES MORE TO THE U.K. IN TERMS OF OUR BENEFITS SYSTEM BUT WITH CHILD BENEFIT THIS THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY THAT IN THE DANISH DANISH PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THAT AS WELL
DO YOU THINK YOU PICKING UP THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRY SORT OF SAYING LOOK HOLD ON A SECOND THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW NOT FAIR YES ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO STRETCH A LITTLE BIT FOR DAVID CAMERON BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DOMESTIC AUDIENCES THAT THEY NEED TO PLAY TO SO THEY DON'T WANT TO COME OUT LOOKING LIKE TWENTY SEVEN
LOSERS FROM THE SUMMER SO IT'S ALWAYS A GAME ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SING LIKE THEY'RE WINNING AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR ONE THING THAT THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT THAT SO IF YOU GIVE DAVID CAMERON A CONCESSION THAN EVERYONE STARTS TO PILE ON BOARD AND YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE
I THINK IF YOU REALLY SORT OF DRAW BACK THE LANDS THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST BARREL TONIGHT IN A MUCH LONGER ABOUT ON ABOUT WHAT SHAPE ARE TWO OR THREE SPEED EUROPE WILL TAKE BRITAIN IS SAYING IT WANTS TO BE IN THE SLOW LANE ON THE OUTLINE AND EVERYONE ELSE IS NOW GOING TO JOCKEY AROUND AND EITHER RIDING BEHIND DAVID CAMERON AND TAKE SOME OF THE SAME CONCESSIONS HE'S WINNING OR JOCKEY FOR THEIR NEW CONCESSIONS THAT THEY WANT NEXT MONTH BUT IT BUT IT WAS ALSO VERY INTERESTING HERE IS HIS HEARING
JUST HOW MUCH THE LAWYERS ARE PLAYING A ROLE I MEAN THIS IS FRASER A WAR ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO CHIPPING IN AND SAYING HOLD ON A SECOND IT'S THIS IS A CLUB BRITAIN CAN'T HAVE THAT AND ACTUALLY THAT'S WORKING TO SOME OTHER COUNTRIES BENEFIT YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN YOU GO TO HUNGARY AND THE HUNGARIAN
PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT WANT TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR SETTLEMENT MARIE LE PEN AND FRANCIS TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR EXIT SO THERE'S SORT OF A SENSE IN WHICH YOU SAID P. PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS YES THE U.K. IS EXCEPTIONAL IN MANY RESPECTS BUT PERHAPS THEY WANT TO HAVE A BIT OF A BIT OF LEEWAY TO I GUESS IT'S A QUESTION OF HOLDING THE LINE IT'S HOW MUCH YOU GIVE
TO KEEP EVERYBODY ONSIDE EXACTLY I MEAN AS YOU SAID EARLIER THE END PERHAPS WE ARE INFECTED BY THE BRUSSELS BUBBLE HERE BUT PEOPLE HERE FEEL THAT THEY ARE GIVING QUITE A LOT SOME INSTITUTIONS OR OR SORT OF IDEAS SUCH AS THE INTERNAL MARKET WHAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SACROSANCT THEY ARE BEING CHIPPED AWAY AT BY THE STEEL SO HOW DAMAGING THEN IS WHAT DAVID CAMERON'S DOING HOW DAMAGING IS IT FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK THAT CAN BE CONTAINED BUT IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE BRITAIN WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE IN JUNE
THEN ALL THE GUNS WOULD REALLY COME OUT AND IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE THAT THEY WEREN'T BEING TARGETED PERSONALLY BUT THAT WOULDN'T REALLY BE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND BRITAIN BEING PUT UNDER THE HAMMER THERE BECAUSE WHAT YOU WOULD BE SEEING IS THAT NO ONE WANTS BRITAIN TO FOLLOW OUT THE DOOR
FROM THIS SORT OF SETTING HERE IN BRUSSELS SO THEY WOULD MAKE THE DIVORCE AS PAINFUL AS POSSIBLE THEY WOULD DRAG IT OUT FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND THE MESSAGE WOULD BE THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU HUNGRY OR POLAND OR DENMARK ALSO VOTE TO LEAVE SO THEY'RE ALL OF THESE SORTS OF CALCULATIONS GOING ON IN THE VAN TONIGHT AS WELL IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAN JUST WHAT WILL THAT LOOK LIKE IN THE BRITISH PAPERS TOMORROW MORNING JUST BRIEFLY HOW MOOG AND IS IT YOUR WILL THEY GET THE DEAL
IT'S TRICKY TO SAY I MEAN WHAT IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY'LL GET THE DEAL SPIKED BY FRIDAY I CERTAINLY HOPE SO BECAUSE I THINK THAT IF THEY DON'T THEN IT WILL NOT BE LIKELY THAT WILL HAVE A GENE REFERENDUM AND IN THAT CASE WILL BE EVEN HARDER TO ARGUE TO TO STAY IN THE E.U. O.K. SO A HUGE AMOUNT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON THE TWENTY THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS EMMA HOGAN AND RUN HEATH THANK YOU BOTH OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE JOHNNY LINTON DEPARTMENT IN LONDON JONATHAN HARVEY AND LUCINDA DAY WITH SARAH IN BRUSSELS FROM ALL OF US GOOD MORNING
