IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE SEVENTEENTH OF MAY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH MICHELLE HUSSEIN AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE WAY PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES A RUN WILL BE AT THE CENTRE OF TODAY'S QUEEN'S SPEECH THERE'S BEEN A BIG RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY WHO CARE FOR OTHERS WITH MANY SAYING THEY'RE EXHAUSTED ALSO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME WITH THIS VOTE DO WE DETERMINE THE DECISION THE DECISION TO GET THE COG
OH GREAT O.K. AHEAD OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WE'LL HEAR FROM SOME FIRST TIME VOTERS ALSO ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S MOST HIGH PROFILE SUPPORTERS ON HIS PLANS FOR IMMIGRATION EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HAVE A HOME YOU SEE YOU KNOW NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND ALL THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND THEY LOVE THEIR HOME I'M GOING HOME NO WELL YOU'RE MY PEOPLE I WAS YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE A HALL AND MORE ON THE BIZARRE CASE OF A HUMAN FOOT FOUND IN A PARK IN BATH
YOU DO WONDER IS ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY AROUND HERE WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD IT'S THE UNKNOWN ISN'T IT THERE ARE SOME CLUES HOWEVER AS TO THE POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE BATH FOOT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
A SHAKE UP OF THE PRISON SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES DESCRIBED BY MINISTERS AS THE BIGGEST SINCE THE VICTORIAN ERA WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THIS MORNING'S QUEEN'S SPEECH UNDER THE PROPOSALS PRISON GOVERNORS WILL BE GIVEN FAR GREATER CONTROL OVER THEIR BUDGETS AND EDUCATION PROGRAMMES THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO SAY IT INTENDS TO CHANGE ADOPTION RULES AND BRING IN A NEW BILL OF RIGHTS AS IT LAYS OUT HIS AGENDA IT'S AGENDA FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON LOOKS AHEAD TO THE STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT
THE QUEEN'S SPEECH IS USUALLY A PIVOTAL MOMENTS IN THE POLITICAL CALENDAR BUT THIS TIME IT IS INSTEAD AN ISLAND OF RESPITE IN AN E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
TEARING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY APART SO FOR THE PRIME MINISTER A CHANCE TO EMPHASISE THAT HE'S A RAISINS EXTEND BEYOND NEXT MONTH'S VOTE THE EMPHASIS IMPROVING THE LIFE CHANCES OF THE LEAST WELL OFF PLANS TO IMPROVE SOCIAL CARE AND SPEED UP ADOPTION OR EXPECTED AS IS A SHAKE UP OF PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES PLANS FOR A BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS WILL GET A MENTION TOO BUT THERE'LL BE NO DETAIL UNTIL AFTER THE REFERENDUM
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO TRY IT'S PRISON REFORMS DURING A PILOT SCHEME SIX JAILS WILL TAKE PART INCLUDING EUROPE'S LARGEST PRISON AT WANDSWORTH IN SOUTH LONDON BUT CRITICS SAY THE PROPOSALS WON'T HELP DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF OVERCROWDING VIOLENCE SELF HARM AND INCREASE DRUG USE THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO SAID JAILS WERE FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES
WE ABSOLUTELY DO NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO CHANGE THINGS BUT I'M CONVINCED THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROFESSIONALS AT THE FRONT LINE PRISON GOVERNORS ARE GIVEN ADDITIONAL FREEDOM AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE FIRST OF ALL TO MAKE SURE THE PRISONS ARE SAFE AND THEN SECONDLY TO ENSURE THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN PRISON THAT THE GIVEN THE TOOLS THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE PURPOSE TO THEIR LIVES
WELSH LABOUR LEADER CARWYN JONES WILL BE REAPPOINTED AS FIRST MINISTER TODAY AFTER A DEAL WITH PLAID COME RIGHT TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE FORMATION OF A NEW WELSH GOVERNMENT LABOUR IS THE BIGGEST PARTY AFTER THE RECENT ASSEMBLY ELECTION BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD AN OVERALL MAJORITY
THE CHARITY AGE YOU SAYS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AGED OVER EIGHTY WHO PROVIDE CARE FOR OTHERS HAS RISEN SHARPLY AND IT'S CALLING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT THEM AGE U.K. SAYS THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CARERS AGED OVER EIGHTY AND SAYS THAT MANY ADMIT TO BEING EXHAUSTED SOPHIE LONG REPORTS
AGE U.K. ESTIMATES ONE IN SEVEN PEOPLE AGED EIGHTY OR OVER NOW PROVIDING CARE OF SOME SORT FOR A LOVED ONE IT SAYS IN DOING SO THEY'RE SAVING THE STATE FIVE POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND THAT MORE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT SUPPORTING THEM AND THE PEOPLE THEY'RE LOOKING AFTER
MOST OLDER CARERS HAVE TOLD THE CHARITY THEY CARRY OUT THIS ROLE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BUT SOME SAY THEY SEE NO ALTERNATIVE PROMPTING CALLS FOR MORE INVESTMENT FROM GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THEY GET THE HELP THEY NEED
INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION HAS UPHELD A COMPLAINT AGAINST A FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE SUN WHICH CLAIMED THE QUEEN BACK TO BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IT SAYS THE HEADLINE PUBLISHED IN MARCH WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE ACCOMPANYING STORY AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING SUGGESTING A FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OF THE QUEEN'S CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS
IN VENEZUELA THE OPPOSITION HAS CALLED FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS TO PROTEST AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S LEADER AMID A WORSENING ECONOMIC CRISIS PRESIDENT NIKOLAOS MEDORO HAS CALLED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ACCUSED THE U. S. OF TRYING TO OVERTHROW HIM BUT THE OPPOSITION LEADER AND RE CAKE A PRIS LES SAID MY MEDORO SHOULD STAND DOWN
HOW DO YOU THANK YOU GO YOU HELLO HELLO IT THAT THE MOMENT OF TRUTH IS COMING IT'S TIME TO DECIDE IF YOU'RE WITH THE CONSTITUTION OR WITH MY DAUGHTER
THAT'S A DECISION BUT THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES WILL HAVE TO MAKE WE DON'T WANT A MILITARY SOLUTION THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEKING THE REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT
THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME THE MOVE WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR SHIFT IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND HE WAS CRITICISED BY THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE DEMOCRATIC RACE HILLARY CLINTON HER TEAM SAID HE APPEARED TO HAVE WHAT THEY TERMED A BIZARRE FASCINATION WITH FOREIGN STRONG MEN MY TRUMP EXPLAINED HOW HE HOPED TO FORCE THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER TO MAKE CONCESSIONS
I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM SPEAKING TO HIM AT THE SAME TIME I'VE GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE AND CHINA BECAUSE HE CAN AMICABLY MACHLI WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER OVER JANET PEOPLE DON'T REALISE THAT JANET CAN SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM WITH ONE MEETING A WONDERFUL
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY ELECTION IN THE U.S. STATE OF OREGON HAS BEEN WON BY BERNIE SANDERS HE SAID TO BE NECK AND NECK WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN CAN TAKI THE RESULTS WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT IN THE OVERALL RACE WITH MISSUS CLINTON HOLDING A BIG LEAD DONALD TRUMP WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN OREGON ADDING ANOTHER STATE TO HIS TALLY
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND LOUISE LEAR AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING LEWIS MORNING JOHN WELL I TOLD YOU SO WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES A REALLY MISERABLE DAY FOR MOST OF US TODAY A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND A LOT OF RAIN AND ONCE THE RAIN CLEARS IS GOING TO BE PLENTY OF SHOWERS SOME OF THEM HEAVY AND THUNDERY SO LET'S CRACK ON NORTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THERE'S A FRONT AT THE MOMENT SITTING THROUGH THE SPY AND DOWN THROUGH THE PENNINES
INTO THE MIDLANDS AND THAT WILL MOVE ITS WAY STEADILY EAST IT'S BRINGING SOME RAIN SOME OF IT HEAVY IF YOU'RE MOVING TO EAST ANGLIA THE SOUTH EAST CORNER TOWARDS LUNCHTIME AND REALLY JUST LINGERING TO EAST ANGLIA THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON FOLLOWING ON BEHIND SUNNY SPELLS AND SCATTERED SHOWERS BUT TEMPERATURES A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN DEGREES
THE SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WALES AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND WELL WE'VE SEEN HEAVY OVERNIGHT RAIN IT'S ALREADY CLEARED AWAY AND IT'S A CASE OF SUNNY SPELLS AND SCATTERED SHOWERS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY SOME OF THEM REALLY QUITE HEAVY WITH SOME HAIL AND SOME THUNDER MIXED IN THERE SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF SURFACE WATER AND SPRAY SOME POOR DRIVING CONDITIONS IF YOU'RE CAUGHT IN THE SHARP SHOWERS
TIP TOP TEMPERATURES FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DEGREES FOR SCOTLAND AGAIN SUNNY SPELLS AND SCATTERED SHOWERS BUT MOST OF THE SHOWER SHOULD BE ACROSS EASTERN SCOTLAND AND HERE THERE'LL BE HEAVY AND PERHAPS NOT QUITE AS SUNDRY BUT THEY'LL BE PRETTY DISAPPOINTED
AND TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE AT AROUND THIRTY DEGREES FOR THE NORTHERN ISLES AND HERE WE'RE GOING TO SEE QUITE A LOT OF RAIN AROUND IT'S GOING TO BE COOL WITH LOW CLOUD MIST AND FOG AND FOR NORTHERN IRELAND A BETTER DAY SUNNY SPELLS AND SHOWERS WILL BE ISOLATED PERHAPS THE BEST OF THE WEATHER TODAY SIXTEEN DEGREES TOMORROW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH EASTERN AREAS WILL BE DRY AND SUNNY MORE RAIN TO THE NORTH WEST LOUISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE LEAD STORY FOR THE GUARDIAN IS THE SPEECH THAT'S BEEN GIVEN BY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY TO THEE
ANNUAL POLICE FEDERATION CONFERENCE THIS IS HER SIXTH ADDRESS TO THAT EVENT IT'S OFTEN BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME TOUGH TALK AND YESTERDAY SHE TOLD THE POLICE THAT THERE WAS STILL EVIDENCE OF TOO MANY VICTIMS BEING LET DOWN AND WHAT SHE CALLED SHAMEFUL ATTITUDES BY SOME POLICE OFFICERS WHO EVEN EXPLOITED THEIR POSITION TO DEVELOP INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT UNLIKE SOME PREVIOUSLY AS HER SPEECH WAS GREETED BY A SHORT BURST OF POLITE APPLAUSE SHE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FEDERATION ITSELF
HAD STARTED THE PROCESS OF REFORM BUT SHE DID CRITICISE WHAT SHE CALLED QUESTIONABLE AND OPAQUE SPENDING INCLUDING TEN THOUSAND LEAVING PRESENTS CLOTHING ALLOWANCES AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE HOLIDAY HOMES WITHIN AN OVERALL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WORTH THIRTY ONE MILLION POUNDS THE AMERICAN NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE HAS DONE A STUDY ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT SAYS IN THE TIMES AND IN THE DAILY MAIL BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT TAKES ON IT THE TIMES SAYS ON ITS FRONT PAGE IS THE HEADLINE G.M. FOOD SAFE TO EAT GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD IS SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT IT POSES A RISK TO WILDLIFE ACCORDING TO THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH TO DATE THE MAIL HOWEVER SUPER WEEDS AND TOXIN RESISTANT PESTS
HAVE BEEN CREATED BY G.M. FARMING A MAJOR STUDY HAS REVEALED PROMISES OVER THE CONTROVERSIAL TECHNOLOGY HAVE NOT BEEN KEPT SO THEY PAYS YOUR MONEY TAKES JOYCE DO YOU REMEMBER THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN QUEEN BACKS BREAKS IT HARD TO HARD TO FORGET THAT ONE IT WAS ON THE FRONT PAGE IN MARCH AT THE BOTTOM OF TODAY'S FRONT PAGE IS A RATHER SMALLER A BIT HEADLINE OR BANNER SAYING IT'S THEIR RULES AGAINST SONS QUEEN
HEADLINE THIS IS THE INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION WHICH HAS FOUND THAT WITH THAT HEADLINE THE SUN BREACH CLAUSE ONE ACCURACY THE EDITORS' CODE OF PRACTICE THE HEADLINE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING GIVEN THAT IT SUGGESTED A FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OF THE QUEEN'S CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS IF THEY FOUND THAT IT REPRESENTED A FAILURE TO TAKE
NOT TO PUBLISH INACCURATE AND MISLEADING OR DISTORTED INFORMATION WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE SUN LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IF YOU FANCY A NICE LITTLE COTTAGE WITH SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ACRES OF IDYLLIC ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE AND STUNNING COASTAL VIEWS IT'S YOURS THE RENT
ONE POUND A YEAR OR TEN POUNDS FOR TEN YEARS THIS IS THE NATIONAL TRUST OFFERING IT THERE'S ONE LITTLE CATCH YOU HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE SHEEP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
YOU COULD DO IT WITH YOUR FARMING COUNTRY EXPERIENCE NO I LEARNED THAT LESSON ALONG TO ONLY THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TODAY IN THE CENTREPIECE WE ARE TOLD IS THE WAY PRISONS ARE MANAGE DOOR ARE GOING TO BE MANAGED AND HE SURE IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT WHAT'S RATHER THAN THE WAY THEY ARE
WE KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH PRISONS JOHN FROM A SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT THAT CAME OUT THIS WEEK AND SOME FIGURES THAT HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY THE B.B. SEE SAWING RATES OF VIOLENCE SELF HARM REAL PROBLEM WITH NEW PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES OF DRUGS CAUSE INSTABILITY IN JAILS AND OF COURSE SOME OF THEM ARE OVERCROWDED BUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING TO DO IS A PRISONS BILL WHICH WILL GIVE GOVERNORS GREATER FREEDOM TO MANAGE THEIR PRISONS AS THEY SEE FIT AND THEY WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT
BY NEW SORT OF LEAGUE TABLES WHICH WILL COMPARE EMPLOYMENT RATES WHEN PRISONERS LEAVE RATES OF VIOLENCE AND SELF HARM AND THERE WILL BE SIX PRISONS PILOTING THIS NEW APPROACH THIS FREEDOM FOR GOVERNOR'S APPROACH AND THE SIX PRISONS HAVE BEEN NAMED BY THE GOVERNMENT TODAY AND THEY INCLUDE ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST PRISONS WANDSWORTH IN SOUTH LONDON RUN BE IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WHICH HAD A SCATHING INSPECTION REPORT LAST YEAR AND COLD IN LEIGH IN SURREY WHERE
A PRISONER WAS MURDERED LAST MONTH'S CERTAINLY THE PRISONS THEY'VE CHOSEN HAVEN'T BEEN EASY PICKS THE TELEGRAPH LEAD TO THE STORY THAT SAYS PRISONERS COULD BE ALLOWED TO SPEND WEEKENDS IN JAIL AND LIVE AT HOME THE REST OF THE TIME THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY DAVID CAMERON BACK IN FEBRUARY IN FACT WHEN HE OUTLINED MOST OF HIS PRISON REFORMS IN IN A MAJOR SPEECH
AND THE IDEA IS THAT SOME PRISONERS YOU KNOW YOU WOULD YOU WOULD THERE BE PART TIME PRISON FOR THEM AND THE OTHER PART OF THAT TIME THEY WOULD BE MONITORED IN THE COMMUNITY BY NEW SATELLITE TRACKING DEVICES WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN FACT ANNOUNCING TODAY HE'S A PILOT OF THE SATELLITE TRACKING SCHEME WHICH WILL REPLACE THE MORE TRADITIONAL ELECTRONIC TAGS THE ANKLE TAGS AND THE PILOT SITES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED I THINK THE WEEKEND PRISONS IDEA IS QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
AND IT WAS TRIED BY A LABOUR SOME YEARS AGO AND IT DIDN'T WORK AND THE IDEA WAS DITCHED BERNIE THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE WELSH LABOUR LEADER WIND ZONES WILL BE REAPPOINTED FIRST MINISTER OF WALES TODAY AFTER AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH PLIED CUMBRAE NICKS OF OUR POLITICAL EDITOR FOR B. B. C. WALES JOINS US NOW THIS WAS ALL ABOUT DEALING WITH THE RESULTS OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS NECK THAT'S RIGHT A LABOUR ARE BY FAR THE BIGGEST PARTY AT THE ASSEMBLY IN CARDIFF AFTER THE ELECTION BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN OVERALL MAJORITY AND WE'VE HAD A REALLY RATHER DRAMATIC WEEK ACTUALLY AND HER FIRST WEEK AFTER ELECTION I DON'T THINK
THE ASSEMBLY IS SEEN SINCE THE STARTER DEVOLUTION THERE'S BEEN DEADLOCK LABOUR HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT BECAUSE EXACTLY A WEEK AGO THERE WAS THE NOMINATION FOR CAROLINE JONES TO BECOME THE NEXT FIRST MINISTER EVERYONE EXPECTED IT TO BE A FORMALITY BUT THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WERE PRETTY DETERMINED TO GIVE LABOUR A BLOODY NOSE
A PERCEIVED ARROGANCE AS THEY SAW IT ANYWAY IN THE REFUSAL OF LABOUR TO ALLOW A BIT MORE TIME FOR ANY NEGOTIATIONS AND TALKS AND THE PRIDE LEADER LEANNE WOOD WAS NOMINATED BY HER PARTY CRUCIALLY SHE GOT THE SUPPORT OF THE CONSERVATIVES AND YOU UKIP WHICH MEANT THOSE
I DID IT WAS A TIED VOTE LAST WEEK AND AS A RESULT AS WITH ALL SORTS OF EFFORTS BEHIND THE SCENES TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN TODAY'S THAT NOMINATION TO BE RE RUN THIS TIME WITHOUT THE DRAMA THE EXPECTATION THAT CABIN JUDGE WILL BECOME FIRST MINISTER AND BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A MINORITY LABOUR ADMINISTRATION BY THE END OF THE WEEK BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE REACHED IN THE ASSEMBLY GOING FORWARD IN A GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT
OVERALL MAJORITY DECISIONS WE MADE WELL THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW DAYS OF TALKS WITH CLYDE CAMRY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A COALITION BUT AN ATTEMPT AT LEAST TO TRY TO BRING STABILITY TO A MINORITY LABOUR GOVERNMENT SO WHAT THEY'VE AGREED ON AND THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER WHAT THEY CALL A HUNDRED DAY PLAN IS AGREEMENT ON THEIR PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO POLICIES FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE A NEW TREATMENT FUND FOR THE N.H.S.
INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF G.P.S INFRASTRUCTURE I HAVE TO SAY THEY'VE RATHER NEATLY AVOIDED SOME OF THE REALLY CONTROVERSIAL AND DIVISIVE ISSUES WHERE THE TWO PARTIES DON'T AGREE ON BUT IN THE RELATIVELY LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME IN THESE TALKS THEY FOCUSED ON THE AREA'S POTENTIAL QUICK WINS IF YOU LIKE WHERE THEY COULD GET AGREEMENT THEN THEY'VE ALSO AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER A MUCH CLOSER IN FUTURE SO
AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE WERE LABOUR AND PLAY CAN GET AGREEMENT AND LABOUR WILL HAVE THE NUMBERS TO GET THINGS LIKE BUDGETS AND LEGISLATION THROUGH BUT NO ONE'S LOCKED IN TO ANY FIVE YEAR COMMITMENTS HERE END AND BOTH PARTIES ARE KEEN TO STRESS THEIR INDEPENDENCE
THEY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ON AREAS NEXT OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUARTER PAST SIX AND A LOT OF BUSINESS PRESENTER ROB ROB YEUNG IS IN OLDHAM THIS MORNING THAT'S AT HOME IN THE COTTON BOOM OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS THAT WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE MORE MILLIONAIRES THAN ANY OTHER IN THE WORLD A BIT DIFFERENT TODAY ROB ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED
YES THAT'S RIGHT OUT THIS MORNING WE WERE OLDHAM'S OLD TOWN HALL THEY'RE MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO A YOUNG MAN NAMED WINSTON CHURCHILL GAVE HIS VERY FIRST SPEECH AS A NEW M. P. ON THE STEPS OF THIS BUILDING AND THOSE STEPS WILL SOON LEAD TO A CAFE BUT FROM HERE I CAN SEE THE PENNINES THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE EAST A SIGN THAT WE ARE GETTING SOMEWHERE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF WHAT GEORGE OSBORNE LIKES TO CALL THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE
AND THE SUCCESS OF HIS VISION WILL BE DECIDED IN PLACES LIKE OLDHAM THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS SUGGEST THIS IS THE MOST DEPRIVED TOWN IN ENGLAND LOCALS DISLIKE THE TITLE AND THEY DISPUTE THE STUDIES METHODOLOGY BUT OLDHAM HAS BEEN SUFFERING SINCE THE DECLINE OF ITS MANUFACTURING SECTOR UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THOSE WHO ARE OUT OF WORK SO FINDING A JOB IS TOUGH I'VE BEEN TALKING TO SOME YOUNG JOB HUNTERS AT OLDHAM'S MADLA
SINCE FEBRUARY I'VE BEEN UNEMPLOYED AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A NEW JOB MONEY THOUGHT MORE OF IT'S ME SO I WOULDN'T MIND WHAT IT WERE BUT AS LONG AS I WAS GETTING A DECENT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THAT POCKET I'D BE ALL RIGHT
MY MOTHER AND FATHER BOTH WORKED FOR THE N.H.S. BUT MY DAD WAS RECENTLY MADE UNEMPLOYED WHICH IS WHY I NEED TO FIND A JOB BECAUSE IN IT THERE MY PARENTS RENT AND THAT KNOW UPKEEP FOR LIVING IN THE HOUSE AND
NO MATTER HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE YOU WANT TO SEE YOU EDGE THE EXCUSES ALWAYS NEED MY EXPERIENCE I'M DOING EVERYTHING THAT EVERYONE SAID TO ME TO TRY AND DO A DEFINITE I'VE DONE I'VE NOT SAT ON A CUT BOWL BUT I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE ASKED ME TODAY
SO FAR IN THE END IT CAN OFTEN LEAD TO A JOB BUT I AM CERTAINLY MARSHALL AND AND AND THE EMPLOYABILITY WORKER MUDDLE YOU SIGN IN ORDER
HOW TOUGH IS THE JOBS MARKET HERE THAT IS DOG EAT DOG ACTUALLY I MEAN FOR EVERY ONE PERSON I'D BE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND THIS COURSE IS PROBABLY NUMBER TEN SOMEWHERE ELSE LOOKING FOR THE SAME JOB THEY ARE QUITE SCARCE BUT HE'S JUST ABOUT THAT YOUNG PERSON SO I'LL GET HIM MORE THEY'D HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AND BEING ABLE TO HANDLE THE NOSE COS FOR EVERY TEN NO NOSES IN YOUR HOOFERS YES ROUND THE CORNER
THERE ON THE HIGH STREET THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ARE CLEAR SOME GRAND OLD BUILDINGS ARE A REMINDER OF OLDHAM'S PROSPEROUS MANUFACTURING BUT THERE ARE SOME VACANT STORES AS WELL AND A FEW BOOKIES DISCOUNT CHAINS AND PAWNBROKERS LOCAL HISTORIAN ED STACEY HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT THE TOWN'S CHANGING
WE'VE GONE FROM A TOWN WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS ALL EMPLOYING LOADS OF PEOPLE BRITISH AEROSPACE EMPLOYED OVER TEN THOUSAND PLAITS TEXTILE MANUFACTURING EMPLOYED FIFTEEN THOUSAND A BIG EMPLOYER NOW SOMEONE LIKE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EIGHTY PER CENT EXPORTS THERE A MAJOR EMPLOYER WITH LESSON TWO HUNDRED SO WE NOW
HAVE A TOWN OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES WE'RE MUCH MORE DIVERSIFIED
ONE BUSINESS LEADER SAYS THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS BOB HOLD LEFT THE TOWN TO SEEK SUCCESS THE BIG PROPERTY MAINTENANCE COMPANY MEARS HE COMES BACK TO OLDHAM NOW AND AGAIN
IF LIKE ME YOU'VE BEEN I SUPPOSE MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL AND THEN YOU GO BACK THERE IS A PSYCHE OF AN OLDHAM
OF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR SUCCESSES IF INDUSTRIES IN DECLINE IF JOB OPPORTUNITY ARE IN DECLINE THEN OF COURSE IT DOES NEED CHANGE BUT THAT'S REMEMBER WE'RE NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE GREAT WORKING METROPOLIS OF MANCHESTER
SO THERE'S ALWAYS THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE LIVE IN OLDHAM AND COMMUTE INTERVENTION IF YOU THEN LOOK JUST A FEW MILES FURTHER ON FROM OLDHAM YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GEOGRAPHY IN THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT'S AN UNDER SELLING THERE WE ARE WE HOPE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT PROMOTED IN THAT WAY
THINGS ARE CHANGING THE OLD VICTORIAN TOWN HALL BUILDING HE'S BEEN TURNED INTO A CINEMA COMPLEX OLDHAM HASN'T HAD A CINEMA FOR MORE THAN A DECADE
THE LEADER OF THE COUNCIL JEAN STRETTON SAYS THE TOWN NEEDS MORE INVESTMENT INCLUDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL PARTS OF GREATER MANCHESTER BENEFIT WE DON'T BUY AND I DON'T BUY THE THEORY THAT IF PLACES LIKE THE CITY CENTRE OF MANCHESTER IN TRAFFORD DO WELL THEN PLACES LIKE OLD WILL BENEFIT FROM A TRICKLE DOWN FACTOR WE ALSO NEED TO BE CLEAR
THAT THERE IS STILL A NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE INVESTMENT IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY STILL THAN THERE IS IN THE NORTH AND JUST SHOOTING PHRASES LIKE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE
THAT WAS JEAN STRETTON ANOTHER LABOUR LEADER OF OLDHAM COUNCIL AS WE HEARD THERE AN AWFUL LOT RIDES ON BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT IN WITH ME IN THE DRIZZLE THIS MORNING OFF TO BUSINESS LEADERS DAVID BELL IS THE FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WHICH MAKES CASH HANDLING MACHINERY AND CRAIG DAVID THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WEB APPLICATIONS U.K. WHICH MAKE SOFTWARE INCLUDING RESERVATION SYSTEMS LORD INTUBATE DEMONIC SO CRAIG FIRST OF ALL WHY AREN'T YOU CREATING MORE JOBS
WE HAVE FREE VACANCES RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T THINK IT'S THE CASE THAT THE JOBS AREN'T ALWAYS THERE THERE'S DEFINITELY AN ISSUE IN MANY SECTORS PARTICULARLY HI TECH SEX THERE'S LIKE EIGHTY WHERE WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT PEOPLE WITH THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND ACTUALLY NOW ON INDUSTRY WE SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT TIME FOCUSING ON TRAINING PEOPLE UP OURSELVES AND GET THEM TO THE LEVEL WHERE THEY REACH A LEVEL WORLD CAN BE PRODUCTIVE DAVID YOU STRUGGLE TO FIND PEOPLE WITH THE SKILLS YOU NEED HERE
YES WE DO AND WE HAVE A DEDICATED PERSON JUST TO RECRUIT PEOPLE I NEVER IN MY LIFE I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD MATHEMATICIAN
SCIENTISTS TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS WE DO BUT BUT WE DON'T NEED THESE PEOPLE AND THEN WE WE CAN'T FIND THEM SO CRAIG WHAT DO YOU NEED TO OFFER THEN THE PEOPLE WITH THE SKILLS BECAUSE PRESUMABLY THEY EXIST SOMEWHERE TO COME HERE AND WORK FOR YOU
I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY JUST A SKILLS SHORTAGE HERE IN OLDHAM OR EVEN A SKILL SO I CHEER IN GREATER MANCHESTER WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE U.K. JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM HERE WE HAVE MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY WHICH FAMOUSLY EMERGED WHICH WAS THE INVENTOR OF THE
MODERN COMPUTER WE'VE ALSO GOT LIVERPOOL JUST DOWN THE ROAD WHICH HAS AN EXCELLENT COMPUTER SIZED SALFORD WHICH WE DO A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK WITH THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN AND HERE IN OLDHAM ITSELF FROM HUDDERSFIELD UNIVERSITY BUT I DON'T I THINK ACTUALLY THE ISSUE HERE IS MAKING SURE THAT RIGHT FROM AN EARLY AGE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS PREPARING PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS READY FOR THE MODERN AGE WHICH IS NO LONGER KNOWLEDGE BASED VERY MUCH SKILLS BASED SO DAVID
BUSINESS IS CAN'T DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN THEN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE CONCEPT THAT'S GEORGE OSBORNE TALKS ABOUT A LOT WHAT DOES THAT NEEDS TO BACK UP WHAT WE HEARD JEAN STRETTON REFERRING TO HIS RHETORIC
RIGHT I THINK HE'S JUST BEEN A BIT TOO AMBITIOUS IF I WAS DOING IT I SPLIT IT IN TWO AND I HAVE ONE NO
HOUSE THAT IS CENTRED ON MANCHESTER AND WON THE SENSE ON LEADS SO THAT THEY WILL BE EAST AND WEST POWER HOUSE BECAUSE THE PENNINES OH JUST
LIKE UM A C. TO GET OVER
UM TALKING ABOUT NEWCASTLE IN THE SAME VOICE IT ISN'T ON THE RADAR OF MANCHESTER SOMEWHERE THAT NEWCASTLE SO I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO JUST BRING IT IN AND BE SENSIBLE ABOUT IT A BIT MORE NORTHERN RIVALRY KIT INTO NORTHERN HURRY PERHAPS COULD HELP WHAT DO YOU THINK CRAIG ABOUT THAT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY IT'S GOING TO BE SPENT ON HIGH SPEED TO THE RAY LINE CONNECTING LONDON TO THE MIDLANDS THE NORTH WEST AND PERHAPS FURTHER AFIELD IS THAT A GOOD IDEA
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEM IN FOR SHORT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COMMUTE AND TO TRAVEL AROUND THE REGION BUT LIKE LAKKA SAY WERE INCREASINGLY DIGITAL ECONOMY I DO OFTEN THINK THAT POLICY MAKERS REALLY MISUNDERSTAND THIS WHEN THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE WAS LAUNCHED HERE AT THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY I WAS THERE WHEN DAVID CAMERON SAID WE DON'T SHIT
PRODUCT OF THE INTERNET WELL CERTAINLY WE SHIP PRODUCT OF INTERNET LAWYERS ACCOUNTANTS THE B.B.C. MOST WAS DOING A SHIT PRODUCT OVER THE INTERNET I DO THINK THAT ACTUALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE UP A LOT OF THE COUNTRYSIDE TO LAY RAIL WE SHOULD PROBABLY SPEND THEIR TIME OR SLAINTE FIBRE DOWN AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MATCH THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IT TRANSPORT LINKS TO THE CRATER
DAVID THAT THE CHINESE PRESIDENT SHE'S IN PING WAS IN GREATER MANCHESTER AYE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TALKING ABOUT THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE IDEA DO YOU THINK THINGS LIKE THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE ALREADY OR WAS IT JUST TOO EARLY
I THINK THAT COMPANIES LIKE OURS ALREADY MANUFACTURING CHINA SHELLING TO CHINA AND WERE ALREADY THERE
BUT I THINK ROD'S M. SIXTY TWO WANT WIDENING BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH FREIGHT TRAFFIC GOING OVER THERE GOING DOWNSTREAM AGAIN AND THEIR PLACE ON THE EAST COAST
WHEN DO YOU THINK OLDER MIGHT SHAKE OFF THIS TITLE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED PLACE IN ENGLAND I THINK THAT'S A TALE THEY EXIST OUTSIDE OF OLDHAM FRANKLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SIT DOWN FOLKS ON A LOCKER IT'S INTERESTING YOU MENTION THE PRESIDENT CHINA BE HERE WHEN HE WAS HERE WE WERE DOING MANCHESTER JUNIOR AND WE HAD A WHOLE GROUP OF FOURTEEN TO NINETEEN YEAR OLDS LEARNING TO COLD AND CREATING COLD
WE'RE DOING A HUGE AMOUNT IN TERMS OF EDUCATION AND ARE CELLS THAT IS A MESS I WOULD THAT BY GOVERNMENT AND BACKED BY SUPPORT I THINK THAT'S A REAL ROLE FOR BUSINESSES HERE IS THAT WE WE NEED TO START TAKING EDUCATION BY OUR HANDS AND GRABBING GET OURSELVES TO MAKING SURE MAKE A DIFFERENCE GIVE AWAY FOR POLICY MAKERS TO CATCH UP IT'S JUST TOO LATE O.K. GREAT
CRAIG DEAN DAVID DALLAS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED WELL LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS NOW IN DRY WARM LONDON STUDIO IS JOHN BOTHAM FROM INVEST PERPETUAL GOOD MORNING JOHN MORNING
WE'VE GOT A SLEW OF COMPANIES REPORTING EARNINGS TODAY BURBERRY IS ONE OF THEM WILL GET THEIR FULL YEAR RESULTS RESULTS WILL WE SEE MORE BUMPS IN THE RATE FOR THEM FROM EMERGING MARKETS I THINK CLEARLY THAT A LOT OF THE GROWTH FOR BURBERRY HAS COME THROUGH GROWTH AND EMERGING MARKETS PARTICULARLY CHINA AND THIS IS TRUE OF THE WHOLE LUXURY GOODS INDUSTRY AND CHINA THE GROWTH IN CHINA CAN CHINESE CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED DOWN
AND THAT IS AN ISSUE FROM FOR BURBERRY HAVEN'T THAT WON'T GO AWAY I THINK THAT ANOTHER ISSUE FOR BURBERRY IS THE WAY THE CHINESE SHOP TRADITIONALLY HONG KONG HAS BEEN THE MAIN PLACE WHERE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE TRAVELLED TO ON HOLIDAY INCREASINGLY THEY'RE TRAVELLING TO JAPAN AND THAT'S A MARKET IN WHICH BURBERRY ISN'T PARTICULARLY STRONG SO THAT THE LOSING SOME SHARE
CLOSER TO HOME WE HAD THE LATEST INFLATION DATA YESTERDAY WHICH SHOW THAT THE INFLATION RATE FELL A BIT EVEN AS THE OIL PRICE HAS BEEN ROCKETING HI WOODS SO WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON THERE I THINK THAT'S JUST A TIMING ISSUE YOU'VE GOT TO BEAR IN MIND THE OIL PRICE IS STILL BELOW WHERE IT WAS A YEAR AGO AND AS AS AS WE GO THROUGH THE YEAR I THINK WE WERE BECAUSE OF
THEY ALL PRICE BEGINNING TO PICK UP FROM THE VERY LOW LEVELS WE SAW IN JANUARY WE WILL SEE INFLATION PICKING UP AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OIL IT'S ALSO ABOUT A SLIGHT PICK UP IN IN WAGES AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF WEAKNESS IN STERLING WILL MEAN THAT THE INFLATION RATE TICKS UP FROM HERE ONLY MODESTLY BYE
AND BRIEFLY WE LLOYD'S PAY THE GOVERNMENT A FAT DIVIDEND YESTERDAY PLANS TO SELL IT BY THE END OF THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WHEN WILL WE HAVE A SIMILAR STORY WITH THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND I THINK THEY'LL TAKE MUCH LONGER THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MOVING PARTS THAT ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND THOUGH THEY HAVE TO STILL HAVE UNKNOWN SOME RISKS AT RISK AROUND LITIGATION PARTICULARLY THE U.S. AND ALSO THEY NEED TO MAKE HER A DISPOSAL OF THEIR
WILLIAMS AND GLYN BUSINESS SO I THINK THAT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER I'LL BE S. IS STILL STILL IN TRANSITION

WELSH LABOUR LEADER CARWYN JONES WILL BE REAPPOINTED AS FIRST MINISTER TODAY AFTER A DEAL WITH PLAID COME TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE FORMATION OF A NEW WELSH GOVERNMENT LABOUR IS THE BIGGEST PARTY AFTER THE RECENT ASSEMBLY ELECTION BUT IT FAILED TO WIN AN OVERALL MAJORITY
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE QUEEN WILL TELL US THIS MORNING WHAT NEW LAWS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO PASS OVER THE COMING YEAR NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NOT A GREAT DEAL NORMAN BUT PRISONERS IS THE BIG ONE PRISONERS IT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO FLAG UP AS THE MAIN LEGISLATION THERE THINKING BEING TO GIVE PRISONS MUCH GREATER INDEPENDENCE MODELLED REALLY ON THE GREATER INDEPENDENCE GIVEN TO SCHOOLS WITH THE ACADEMY SYSTEM AND UNDER THE LEGISLATION SIX PRISONS REFORM PRISONS AS THEY WILL BE CALLED THE GOVERNORS WILL BE GIVEN
CONTROL OF THEIR OWN BUDGETS WHETHER THEY WANT TO ABIDE BY NATIONAL CONTRACTS OR HAVE THEIR OWN CONTRACTS MORE CONTROL OVER THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF PRISONS IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF EDUCATION PROVIDED THE SORT OF REHABILITATION FAMILY VISITING AND ALONGSIDE THAT THERE WILL BE GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THAT THEY WILL BE LEAGUE TABLES PUBLISHED TO COMPARE PRISONS IN TERMS OF
WHETHER PRISONERS GO ON TO EMPLOYMENT WHETHER THEY ARE RE OFFENDERS LOOKING AT SELF HARM AND VIOLENCE IN PRISON AND LASTLY THERE WILL BE A PILOT OF GREATER USE OF TAGGING AND MY SENSES BROADLY THESE ARE MEASURES WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE WELCOMED BY A PRISON REFORM CHARITIES BUT I THINK THE CRITICISM WILL BE THAT IT IS A A LIMITED STEP IN PRISON REFORM AND THE BIG HULKING ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM REMAINS MASSIVE
OVERCROWDING INTO A DRESS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT SENTENCING REFORM WHY DO WE SEND SO MANY PEOPLE TO PRISON AND ALTERNATIVES TO CUSTODY BECAUSE OF A VIEW THAT PRISONS BASICALLY BECOME CENTRES FOR VIOLENT SELF HARM MENTAL ILLNESS AND DRUG IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY WELL BE PREOCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE IT HAS OTHER WORRIES ON ITS HANDS NOT LEAST THE REFERENDUM ON THE WAY THE TORY PARTY SEEMS TO BE TEARING ITSELF APART
IT IS BLUNTLY A QUEEN SPEECH FOR A QUIET LIFE IT IS A QUEEN SPEAKS WRITTEN IN THE SHADOW OF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM WHICH NOW DOMINATES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IT IS
ABSORBING ALL OF MISTER CAMERON'S POLITICAL ENERGY BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S ENGAGED IN THE POLITICAL FIGHT OF HIS LIFE WHICH WILL DETERMINE HIS FATE AND DETERMINE HIS LEGACY BUT MORE THAN THAT HE KNOWS HE CANNOT AVOID FLASHPOINTS OF DISSENT SUCH AS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE BUDGET WHERE TORY DISSENTERS AND BRECHT'S HER TEARS COMBINED TO INFLICT PAIN
ON DAVID CAMERON AND WE'VE SEEN THAT REPEATEDLY WE SAW IT OVER ACADEMIES WE SAW IT OVER CHILD REFUGEES WE SAW IT OVER SUNDAY TRADING AND THE DIFFICULTY MISTER CAMERON FACES IS HE IS COMPARATIVELY POLITICALLY ENFEEBLED AT THE MOMENT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS SMALL MAJORITY BUT BECAUSE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH MEANS HE HAS TO TREAD INCREDIBLY CAUTIOUSLY WHICH IS WHY THE MEASURES IN THE SCREEN SPEECH
I MEAN I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHETHER THEY PROVOKE MUCH OPPOSITION AT ALL IN PARLIAMENT SO THINGS LIKE PROVIDING CRATER SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE LEAVING CARE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT THAT SPEEDING UP ADOPTION MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY SUPPORT THAT ENSURING EXTREMIST CAN'T WORK WITH CHILDREN MOST PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT THAT SO IT'S NOT A SIDESHOW THIS QUEEN SPEED BUT IT'S IT'S SORT OF THERE THE BREAD ROLL ALONGSIDE THE MAIN COURSE WHICH REMAINS EUROPE AND A QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT MICHAEL HESELTINE VERSUS BORIS JOHNSON
IT'S HARD TO CHARACTERISE FRANKIE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE TORY PARTY AS ANYTHING BUT CIVIL WAR I MEAN AN EXTRAORDINARY INTERVENTION BY MICHAEL HESELTINE BUT I THINK IT REFLECTS TWO THINGS ONE IS THE SHEER ANGER AMONGST MY CAMERON'S FRIENDS AT THE CONDUCT OF BORIS JOHNSON AND ALARM AT HIS POTENTIAL TO GALVANISE THE OUTSIDE
AND THIS GOES BACK TO HIS VERY DECISION TO SUPPORT THE BRICKS ARE TEARS WHICH INCENSED MANY IN DOWNING STREET THAT ANGER HAS BEEN BOILING EVER SINCE BECAUSE OF SOME OF HIS REMARKS CULMINATING YESTERDAY IN HIS SUGGESTION THAT MISTER CAMERON WAS OFFERING PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRACTS TO GET BUSINESSES TO BACK BRECHT SET AND MY SENSES THEY SENT MICHAEL HESELTINE UP TO CUT BORIS JOHNSON AT THE KNEES TO POLITICALLY IN FEEBLE HIM AND UNDERMINED HIM BY SUGGESTING HIS JUDGEMENT WAS SHOT THROUGH NO THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTESTS ARE EXPECTED IN VENEZUELA TODAY AMID CONTINUING PUBLIC ANGER OF THE DIRE STATE OF THE ECONOMY WITH EMERGENCY POWERS IN PLACE PROTESTERS RISK FORCE BEING USED AGAINST THEM ARE SOUTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT WE'RE DAVIS IS IN CARACAS EVERY WEEK I THINK THAT THE SITUATION IN THAT AS WELL AGAIN GET GETS WORSE THE WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION
IS IT GETTING MORE ACUTE WE'VE HAD PROTESTS EVERY WEEK AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND OF COURSE IN FAVOUR OF THE GOVERNMENT LAST WEEKEND NICHOLAS MEDORA THE PRESIDENT AGAIN SEIZED EXTRAORDINARY POWERS WHICH WILL STAY IN PLACE FOR ANOTHER SIXTY DAYS I THINK THE SITUATION IS
SPIRALLING DOWN HILL THE OPPOSITION IN RESPONSE TO MY MAJORITY RHETORIC HAS CALLED FOR THE ARMY TO TAKE A POSITION WHICH IS THREATENING IN ITSELF SO I DON'T SEE A QUICK FIX IN VENEZUELA THE ECONOMY OF COURSE IT IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OIL RESERVES YET THERE'S A ENERGY CRISIS PEOPLE CAN'T GET BASIC GOODS IN THE SHOP
THE GOVERNMENT AT THE WEEKEND HE'S TALKING ABOUT PUTTING THE ARMY ON THE STREETS AS A SHOW OF FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY OUT OF THIS CONFLICT BETWEEN AN OPPOSITION DOMINATED CONGRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS DIGGING HIS HEELS IN AND A GOVERNMENT WHICH SEEMS TO BE BLAMING THE UNITED STATES IN LARGE PART FOR ITS PROBLEMS
BUT THIS IS RHETORIC ON PRESIDENT MY DAUGHTER'S PARTY IS CONVINCED OF HER HER WESTERN CAPITALIST CONSPIRACY TO DEMONISE NOT ONLY HIS GOVERNMENT BUT TO BRING DOWN THE WELL IN ECONOMY THERE'S NO REAL PROOF OF THAT IN HIS SPEECH TO FOREIGN JOURNALISTS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AN AMERICAN PLANE ALLEGEDLY MAKING INCURSIONS INTO VENEZUELAN AIRSPACE IN THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS
LAYING THE GROUND FOR A POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVASION BUT THOSE DAYS ARE LONG GONE NOBODY WOULD HE BELIEVES THAT RHETORIC APART FROM PRESIDENT WAS PERHAPS OWN CLOSE SUPPORTERS AND HE'S HANGING ON TO POWER THE OPPOSITION DOMINATED CONGRESS AS TRYING TO SUMMON ENOUGH ENOUGH
SIGNATURES FOR A RECALL REFERENDUM WHICH COULD FORCE MY MEDORA OUT OF OFFICE BUT THAT IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT WHICH WOULD HAVE TO VALIDATE THIS IS HEAVILY STACKED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S FAVOUR SAID THERE'S A STALEMATE AND VENEZUELA ITSELF THE GOVERNMENT IS BLAMING EVERYBODY BUT ITSELF FOR THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE OPPOSITION IS LOOKING INCREASINGLY DESPERATE BECAUSE IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO
FORCED THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF POWER WE'RE DAVIS IN CARACAS THANK YOU FOR THE TIME HE'S TWENTY TO SEVEN REMEMBER THAT HEADLINE IN THE SUN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE TOLD US WHAT THE QUEEN THOUGHT ABOUT THE REFERENDUM APPARENTLY SHE BACKED BRECHT'S IT WELL TODAY THE SUN
HAS BEEN FORCED TO PUBLISH A RETRACTION IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS STEVE HEWLETT IS THE PRESENTER OF THE MEDIA SHOW ON RADIO FOUR STEVE I'D HESITATE WITH THE WORD RETRACTION BECAUSE WHAT IT'S DONE IS SIMPLY REPORT WHAT IPSO THE COMMITTEE THAT LOOKS INTO THESE ALLEGATIONS COMPLAINTS HAS FOUND YES WELL WHAT IT SO IT'S NOT THE THE ARTICLE ITSELF WAS NOT COMPLAINED
WHAT WAS COMPLAINED ABOUT WAS THE HEADLIGHT NOT ARTICLE ONE OF THE HIPS O.K. LETS HIS CODE OF PRACTICE ENTITLED ACCURACY SAYS I'LL QUOTE OPPRESSED MUST TAKE CARE NOT TO PUBLISH INACCURATE MISLEADING OR DISTORTED INFORMATION OR IMAGES INCLUDING HEADLINES NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT THAT WAS THE ESSENTIAL THAT WAS THE COMPLAINT BY THE PALACE THE PALACE WOULD NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT

WITH A HEADLINE WHICH FRANKLY I THINK HONOUR ON A FAIRLY NEUTRAL READING OF THE TEXT LET A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE TIME TO SAY HANG ON A MINUTE I'M NOT SURE THAT HEADLINE QUITE GETS THAT ALL THE QUEEN IS QUOTED AS SAYING IN THE ARTICLE FULL OF ANONYMOUS SOURCES IS THAT A QUOTE I DON'T UNDERSTAND EUROPE THIS WAS SUPPOSEDLY SAID WITH VENOM
ACCORDING TO A VERY SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY SOURCE AT THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE WORTH REMEMBERING OF COURSE THAT THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION AROUND THE LUNCH TABLE WHICH NICK CLEGG WAS PRESENT FIRST OF ALL HE DENIED BUT BENDING IT'S SORT OF BEEN SAID OR HE SAID HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF IT OTHERS NEVERTHELESS ANONYMOUSLY TOLD THE SUN UP THEY HAD BUT THIS ALL OCCURRED
AGES BEFORE THE TERM BRECK'S IT HAD EVEN BEEN INVENTED SO EVEN EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE BUT THE QUEEN HAD SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND EUROPE
THAT PUTS IN LEAGUE WITH VERY MANY PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THE REMAINED SO TO IT TO EXTEND WHAT THE QUEEN WAS HAD REPORTEDLY
SAID OR WHAT IT WAS SAID THE ENORMOUS SORRY WHAT DO YOU BEING ON A SOURCES SAID SHE'D SAID TO THE HEADLINE REALLY WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN COULD BE JUSTIFIED THAT'S WHAT IT WAS TOOK THEM UP ON ROD BUT THE SUN ISN'T SAYING SORRY
IT'S NOT SAYING SORRY IT'S STANDING BY THE ARTICLE BUT IT HAS NO CHOICE UNDER ITS OWN RULES BUT TO REPORT IT SO SAID WHICH IS THAT THE HEADLINE WAS WHAT WAS IT WHAT THE TERM THEY USED WAS CONJECTURE NONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS STORY WERE REPORTED TO HAVE MADE SUCH A CLAIM AS A RESULT THERE THAT I BECAME THE QUEEN SPORTY BREAKS IT AND THAT'S WHERE IT WENT OUT IS IT DOING THE JOB IT'S MEANT TO BE DOING
WELL LOOK ON THE FACE IT IN THIS CASE YOU WOULD THINK SO I MEAN IT'S ALSO GENERALLY SPEAKING I MEAN OH
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEWSPAPERS WOULD SAY YES IT IS CAMPAIGNERS WOULD SAY NO IT ISN'T BUT WE ARE STARTING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS THERE IS MAKING A NUMBER OF RULE I MEAN THE CAN THE CAMPAIGNERS WILL ARGUE THAT IT SO IT'S NOT THE REAL DEAL
BUT IT DOESN'T PASS VARIOUS OF THE TESTS THAT LEVERSON SET FOR A NEW INDEPENDENT PRESS REGULATOR IT'S ALL INDEPENDENT ENOUGH EXCEPT FOR EXACTLY SUCH BUT THESE COMPLAINTS OFF ARE GETTING
HARDER TO SUSTAIN IN THE SENSE THAT NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT STRICTLY TRUE BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO KEEPS DOING THINGS LIKE THIS SO IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE ON THE SON REMEMBERED HAS TREVOR COVER MY MOUTH LIPS ENSEMBLE SWELLS UP ON ITS BOARD IF THEY'LL WILL TAKE ON THE SUN TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT LIKE THIS YOU'D HAVE TO SAY THAT

THE EXPRESS HAS CHARACTERS LIKE PEGGY ARE ETERNAL THE GOOD MOTHERS OF BAD SONS THE GUARDIAN QUOTE SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE SHOW SAYING THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH MEDICAL EXPERTS AND VARIOUS CHARITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE STORY LINE WAS PORTRAYED SENSITIVELY
OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING CHANGES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT THIS MORNING THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO MACHIAVELLI WROTE HIS INFLUENTIAL PHILOSOPHY ON POWER THE PRINCE IN WHICH MANIPULATION CUNNING INTIMIDATION AND COERCION ARE SEEN AS THE ROOTS TO ACHIEVING IT
NOW AN AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR SAYS HE WAS WRONG TRUE POWER IS ABOUT MODESTY AND EMPATHY DHAKA KELP MOST DIRECTOR OF THE GREATER GOOD SCIENCE CENTRE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE POWER PARADOX
PEOPLE GET POWER BY BEING ENGAGED WITH OTHER PEOPLE BY BEING EMPATHETIC AND REALLY CAREFULLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE FEELING AND THEN PRACTISING GENEROSITY IN COLLABORATION AND THAT REALLY FLIES IN THE FACE OF CANNOCK THIS MACHIAVELLIAN LEGACY OF POWER AND GAINING IT IS REALLY ABOUT FORCE AND FRIED AND DECEPTION IN MANIPULATION INSTEAD WE GAIN POWER BY EVENTS IN THE GRATER
THE SECOND PART OF THE THESIS IN THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE PARADOX COMES THEN ONCE WE FEEL POWERFUL
OR WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A LIFE OF PRIVILEGE WE START TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT EUPHORIC AND WE DON'T WE ARE AWARE OF THE RISKS THAT OUR ACTIONS IN TAIL AND THEN A LOT OF MAYHEM ENSUES AND STUDY SHOW IF I FEEL POWERFUL I MORAL I COULD SWEAR I CHEAT INTO ACTUALLY STEAL THINGS INTO HOARD RESOURCES
HAVE SEXUAL AFFAIRS SO POWER KIND OF TURNS US INTO MARQUIS OF SO IF PAT BUT TO JUST LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT THE FIRST PART OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING POWER AND WHO GETS IT OUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE NICER TODAY TO GET POWER THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST
YEAH WELL THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE MICHELLE SO THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES LOOKING AT WHY DO PEOPLE THINK LEADER SHOULD BE LIKE FORTY YEARS AGO WE WE EXPECT THAT LEADERS TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN COERCIVE IN MACHIAVELLIAN
TODAY BECAUSE OF WOMEN ENTERING THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE OF MORE HORIZONTALLY ORGANISED BUSINESSES POWER HAS BECOME MORE COLLABORATIVE AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE BRIARD SOCIOLOGICAL SHIRT
WE GET POWERS REALLY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT WAS FORTY YEARS AGO IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD WE CAN AUTOMATICALLY THINK OF PLACES RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN BEING THE OBVIOUS EXAMPLE BUT LOOK AT SYRIA SO MANY PLACES WHERE THE STRONG MAN IS NOT JUST THE IMAGE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BUT OFTEN THE IMAGE THAT THEY STILL WANT
YOU KNOW THESE ARE BRIAN HISTORICAL TRENDS IF YOU WELL THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONTEXT TODAY
THAT STILL OPERATE ACCORDING TO THIS MACHIAVELLIAN EITHER THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW AND WHEN I TEACH POWER I'D I REMIND PEOPLE AT WORK IF YOU'RE
IF YOU'RE RUNNING A DRUG CARTEL AND MEXICO IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH VLADIMIR PUTAIN HER FUTURE RUNNING ARMS IN CERTAIN VERY DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THOSE WILL PROBABLY BE GUIDED BY THE MACHIAVELLIAN PRINCIPLES OF FOURSOME FOR'ARD THEIR WORK IS MUCH MORE MULTI ETHNIC IT'S MUCH MORE MULTICULTURAL SO YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM HERE SO IT'S
CHANGED AND YOU SAID PART OF THAT CHANGE IS IS BECAUSE OF WOMEN WOMEN COMING OUT OF THE WORKPLACE WERE WOMEN MAKING THEIR PRESENCE FELT SO DOES A SUCCESSFUL MAN HAVE TO BE UP WITH THE DREADFUL PHRASE BUT IN TOUCH WITH HIS FEMININE SIDE OR OR PERHAPS EVEN MORE FEMININE TO SUCCEED
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY INTERESTING I MEAN FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW OUR LEARNING THAT WE ARE MEN
IN MANY WESTERN CULTURES RISING AND PRATT IN POWER IN REALLY UNPRECEDENTED WAYS ALTHOUGH THEY STILL NEED TO BE PARENT PAID FAIR WAGES WOMEN TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE COLLABORATIVE
I JUST GENERALLY BUT ALSO HOW THEY APPROACH POWER AND SO WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HIS MEN
TO GET ALONG WITH MORE OF THOSE WOMEN IN THEIR WORKPLACE AND ALSO TO LEAD BETTER TEAMS NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EMPATHETIC LISTEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFULLY
PERHAPS VIEW TOWARDS THIS COLLABORATIVE MODEL OF POWER BUT CAN THE SAME QUALITIES WHEN DISPLAYS DISPLAYED BY WOMEN MAKE THEM LOOK LESS
A FLORET AT IT I'M WONDERING IF IT'S MEN WHO FROM THIS SHIFT IT'S MEN WHO HAVE EVERYTHING TO GAIN I THINK THINGS ARE CHANGING TODAY WITH GREATER NUMBERS OF WOMEN IN THE MEDICAL FIELD WITH A LEGAL FIELDER POLITICS OR A FINANCE AND WE ARE MOVING MORE TOWARDS THIS CLAMOUR OF MODEL
AND HOPEFULLY MEN WILL BENEFIT TO A PROFESSOR DECKER KELP THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PROFESSOR COLOURS BUT THE POWER PARADOX HOW WE GAIN AND LOSE INFLUENCES PUBLISHED BY PENGUIN IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN AT THIS PART OF OUR E.U. REFERENDUM COVERAGE WE'VE BEEN TOURING THE LAND HEARING WHAT SOME OF YOU THINK OF IT ALL WHILE YOU'RE HAVING YOUR BREAKFAST TODAY NICK ROBINSON IS IN NORWICH ON THE COMPASS OF EAST ANGLIA UNIVERSITY WAS NICK PRESUMABLY A SLEEPY STUDENT
WITH A SURPRISINGLY A WEEK JOHN AS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HEAR AND THAT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SUPPLY OF FREE COFFEE AND FREE QUESTI CROISSANTS AS WELL THE QUESTION WE WANT TOMATO THIS MORNING HE'S AWAKE HOW ENGAGED AT THE REST OF THEIR GENERATION
WITH A CHOICE WHICH WILL AFFECT THEM FOR LONGER THAN ANY OTHER THE POLES ARE PERFECTLY CLEAR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE REMAINED AN OLDER PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE ALSO CLEAR THAT THEY ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO VOTE AT ALL LET'S HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE JOINING US OVER BREAKFAST
FIRST OF ALL WITH A COUPLE OF OFFICERS FROM THE STUDENT UNION AMY IS WITH ME HERE HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR YOU PERSUADING YOUNG PEOPLE TO EAT REGISTERED TODAY NEVER MIND ACTUALLY VOTE
I THINK
WE'RE AT A QUITE CRUCIAL POINT IN STUDENTS' LIVES WORTH THAT AT THE MOMENT WHETHER COME BETWEEN BESSIE AND THEY WANT
WANT TO GET GET WILL THEY HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO BE ENGAGED
BUT I THINK IF THEY WERE TO LEAVE UNIVERSITY AND NOT REGISTERED SURVIVE
LESS LIKELY TO US IT'S A CRUCIAL POINT AND I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR US AT THE STUDENT UNION TO GET SEEN TO
IS THE LACK OF MOTIVATION FOR THEM AND IT DID
ARGUMENT QUICK SOUND BITE FOR THEM TO GET INVOLVED NO AS IT HAPPENS YOU'RE IN FAVOUR OF VENUS OH GIVE ME WHAT IS THE TEN SECOND TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO BUY GET I THINK
A THREE MILLION JOBS OF THE ELECTORS SINN IT'S YOU THAT IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR FEATURE ALONGSIDE YOUTH IN A STUDENT OFFICER AS WELL BUT IT HAPPENS YOU'RE IN FAVOUR OF GETTING OUT
IS THERE A DIFFICULTY ALSO PERSUADING PEOPLE JUST TO BOTHER AT ALL I LIKE THAT YEAH I THINK PART OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS A UNINSPIRING ON BOTH SIDES GROWING STRONGER AND LEAVE BUT HE WOULD LEAVE YOU AN ALWAYS ON HIS FINEST LOOTED ART ENGAGED SO THAT EVERYBODY'S GETTING PEOPLE TO REGISTER RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOUR BREAKFAST YOU MUTTERING IN YOUR COFFEE AND YOUR CROISSANT IF I WERE TO GET A BIT OF A FEEL AS TO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE TO GET ENGAGED JUST OVER THERE AT THE BACK
WOULD YOU SAY TO FRIENDS IF YOU SAY TO FLAT MATES LOOK THIS REALLY MATTERS DO THEY GO YEAH REALLY ONE HUNDRED BUT ALL MY FAMILY
BEEN HEARING ABOUT EVEN THAT LIKE WITH THE LOCAL ELECTION A LOT MY FIANCE AT HOME AS WELL I SEEN TRYING TO GALVANISE HIM AND HIS COMPUTER SCIENCE FRIENDS AND HAVE A YAWN WHEN YOU
THE RESIDENT POLITICS STUDENT AND THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND SAID TELL US HOW TO VOTE AND I'M
O.K. DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION YEAH AND JUST ALONGSIDE YOU DONE A GREAT JOB HERE I THINK THAT'S QUITE A LOT OF HER CLASS AND SHE WAS WELL AND IF YOU GET THIS SORT OF WORK WITH THE LOWER CLASSES AND THAT THEY DON'T BUT THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASSES COULD BE WELL OUT OF IMMIGRATION AND ALL THAT BUT THEY'RE WORKING ONES WHO SUFFER MAYBE AGEIST O.K.
LIKE THEM ANYTHING AND HE'S THE PROBLEM THEY SAID SIMPLY WON'T VOTE AT ALL THEY JUST THEY EDUCATED ON SO THEY DON'T WANT THEY DON'T BOTHER I DON'T KNOW
I DON'T THINK IT'S THERE IN THE STRIPED SHIRT NEXT YOU YEAH I COME FROM A VERY RURAL COMMUNITY THAT VERY HARD TO GET INFORMATION
ACTUALLY PEOPLE GET OUT AND VOTE AND OF COURSE IT'S THE SAME OLD ARGUMENT WHY BOB
IT'S QUITE BIG ESPECIALLY IN A RURAL AREA DOES IT WORRY YOU AS A GENERATION IF YOU CAN SPEAK FOR A WHOLE GENERATION
THAT IS IT WORSE DECISION MAY MAYBE TAKEN ABOUT YOUR FUTURE BUT BY A DIFFERENT GENERATION YOU MAY IN THE END OPT OUT THERE SOMEBODY NODDING OVER IN THE IN THE FAR CORNER THERE AMY THAT IS A BIG THING FOR PEOPLE CAMPAIGNING TO STAY HERE AND ISN'T IN THERE WERE POSTCARDS HERE AT THE STUDENT UNION STAYS A RIGHT TO YOUR GRAN RIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO SIZE ABOUT A BURGER CAN I PERSUADE YOU TO VOTE MY WAY YEAH I THINK THERE IS SO CRUCIAL WE HAD YOU SPEAK TO YOUR OLDER GENERATION TO ACTUALLY GIVE A NEW VAN
THE NEW FAX FAX SO THE CHANGE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THAT NEW REGULATIONS THAT THEY BRING ON THE NEW JOBS AT THAT BUT THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE POSITIVE VOICE OVER I WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR GENERATION BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS WORK TOGETHER BETTER AS A GROUP BUT I WORRY THAT THERE MIGHT BE FUTURE CONFRONTATION FUTURE CONFLICTS IF WE SEPARATE AND I SOLD THE INDEPENDENT BUT NOT EVERYBODY OF COURSE IS IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN THERE'S A GUY HERE SO IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING MAN WITH A BEARD
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT A PARTNER OF ANY CAMPAIGN HELLO MY NAME IS CALVIN YEAH A LITTLE BIT WHY Y. Y. WHY WERE YOU IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING
I BELIEVED RESPONSIBLY TO LEAD THE WORLD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHARGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE IN THE TECHNOLOGIES WE NEED TO DO THAT
INDIAN AND THEY EXIST ALREADY BUT WE DON'T RESPONSIBLY RESPONSIBLY TO PLACES LIKE AFRICA SOUTH AMERICA THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT'S WHAT ABOUT THAT VIEW OF IN YOUR GENERATION MORE THAN ANY OTHERS TRAVELS MORE THAN THAT PREDECESSORS HAS A MORE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE WHAT ABOUT THE VIEW THAT CHESS IS WHAT WHY BE LIMITED BY EUROPE AND EUROPE ALONE WHY NOT HAVE A BIGGER PERSPECTIVE AND IF YOU'RE ON THIS GUY HERE WITH THE CHEQUE
YEP NO DIZZY COS IT INSIDE US CHRIS YOU'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO'S TRYING TO GET THE VOTE OUT DOES THAT ARGUMENT THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A WIDER PERSPECTIVE HAVE ANY PLATE I THINK DEFINITELY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING PARTICULARLY ON THE SORT OF BLACKS AT CAMP BUT MORE BROADLY I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE THIS IS THE SITUATION IS THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY I THINK WE NEED TO DEBATE AND IS CURRENTLY EXIST RATHER THAN INVENTING NEW ONES IN THE PARAMETERS
AREN'T THERE I KNOW I HAD A PROBLEM CHRIS IT'S KIND OF SAID I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO LEAVE THE YEAH BUT IT'S NOT I KNOW
SOLUTION IF WE IF ON JUNE TWENTY FOURTH WE WERE TO LEAVE IT'S NOT THAT WE COULD JUST QUICKLY BECOME NORWAY SWITZERLAND CANADA FINNEY YOU'D HAVE QUITE AN EFFORT HERE I GUESS PROBABLY SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE IN FAVOUR REMAINING COULD YOU CAN YOU STILL WIN THAT AREN'T YOUR OWN GENERATION
IT'S NOT THAT WE NEED IT'S NOT WEARING ENOUGH PEOPLE OVER TIP THE BALANCE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVE HE'S GOING TO BE A TIGHT THOUGH AND I THINK WE NEED TO MOBILISE IT ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GET OVER THE LINE AND IT'S A DIFFICULT UPHILL BUT I THINK THE ITEMS OF DEMOCRACY COME ONE LAST QUESTION DO YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE BAR TONIGHT AND YOU SAY YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN

THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT WANTS BIG CHANGES TO THE WAY PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES A RUN WHEN THE QUEEN DELIVERS HER SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT TODAY THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTREPIECE OF THE NEW LEGISLATED PROGRAMME MEANING WHAT I'M JOINED BY RICHARD GARSIDE WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR CRIME AND JUSTICE STUDIES AND IAN MACLENNAN MURRAY WHO A FORMER GOVERNOR OF COLD IN THE PRISON IN SORRY FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION RICHARD GARSIDE WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PRISONS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PUT IT RIGHT
WITH THE THE BIG PROBLEM WITH PRISONS AT THE MOMENT IS THAT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY OVERCROWDED THEY'RE DEALING WITH A MUCH SMALLER BUDGETS BUDGETS HAVE BEEN CUT BY ABOUT A THIRD SINCE TWENTY TEN FAR FEWER STAFF
FAR MORE FAR MORE INMATES AND WE'RE SEEING THIS IN THE RISE IN SUICIDES SELF HARM AND ASSAULTS AND HE'S ONLY JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK FEED THE JUSTICE COMMITTEE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS SAID THAT SUICIDE SELF HARM AND VIOLENCE ARE CONTINUING TO GET WORSE IN THE CHAIR OF THE JUSTICE COMMITTEE SAID ACTION ON PRISONER SAFETY REALLY CAN'T WAIT SO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE SO IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THAT WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS SOME STABILITY IN THE SYSTEM WE NEED PROPER INVESTMENT IN THE RAISING MORE MONEY
WELL WE DO TO A DEGREE EITHER NEED TO HAVE MORE MONEY OR WE ACTUALLY JUST NEED FAR FEWER PEOPLE IMPRISONED NOW IF WE IMPRISONED AT THE SAME RATERS WAS IMPRISONED BY UNDER MARGARET THATCHER IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND FEWER INMATES IN PRISON THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN PRISON IS NOT BECAUSE SOMEHOW WE HAVE MORE CRIMINALS AROUND IS BECAUSE WE JUST LOCKING UP A LOT MORE PEOPLE
IN THAT CONTEXT THE REFORM PRISONS PROGRAMME THE GOVERNMENT ARE PROPOSING IS FRANK YOUR TRAGIC DISTRACTION SO SO THE IDEA OF SELF GOVERNING PRISONERS THAT JUST WON'T CRACK IT WELL I MEAN IT'S A KIND OF A SUPERFICIALLY ATTRACTIVE IDEA YOU SPEAK TO A LOT OF PRISON GOVERNORS AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR COMPLAINTS IS THAT THE PRISON SERVICE IS VERY VERY TOP DOWN IT'S VERY COMMAND AND CONTROL SO THERE ARE CERTAINLY AN ARGUMENT AROUND GOVERNORS HAVING MORE AUTONOMY TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS IN RELATION TO THEIR INSTITUTIONS
BUT AGAINST THAT YOU'VE GOT TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THE RISK HERE IS IF YOU HAVE GOVERNORS OPERATING IN KIND OF INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA IF IT'S NOT EMBEDDED WITHIN A BROADER NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAN THAT INNOVATION CAN VERY QUICKLY JUST BECOME IDIOSYNCRATIC IAN MCLAREN MARRIED EH DO YOU ACCEPT THAT ANALYSIS AND B. DO YOU BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE RIGHT THING
I THINK RICHARD GLASS ARTIST GOT IT ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ACTUALLY
I THINK HE'S HIS COMMENTS ABSOLUTELY TO THE POINT I THINK THAT HE AUTONOMY IS A GOOD THING BUT IT IT WOULD BE GOOD AT A LOCAL LEVEL WE USED TO HAVE MORE AUTONOMY PRISON GOVERNORS USED TO HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY
ON DECIDING WHAT HAPPENED IN THEIR PRISON AND HOW THEY COULD SPEND THEIR MONEY SO A RETURN TO THOSE DAYS I THINK WOULD BE WELCOME BUT AS RICHARD RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THAT THE REAL ISSUE IS IS THE SIZE OF THE PRISON POPULATION THE LENGTH OF TIME WE KEEP PEOPLE IN PRISON FOR
BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE BEYOND A GOVERNOR'S CONTROL AND REALLY IN THE GREAT SCHEME OF THINGS IT'S A BIT LIKE REARRANGING THE THE CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC RUN GUS ARE LIMITED SO WE MUST SEND A YOU'RE BOTH SAYING YOU AGREE BUT WE MUST SEND FEWER PEOPLE TO PRISON ABSOLUTELY
IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SERVICE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY STRAINED THE CHANGES IN THE REFORMS WHICH ARE BEING BROUGHT IN WILL BE DWARFED BY THE PROBLEMS AT THE SERVICE FACES SO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE WELCOME WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT THEIR SERVICE IS FACING RICHARD GARTER I DON'T REMEMBER
GOVERNMENTS IN THE LAST YOU SAID SINCE THAT SHIRT IT IF WE HAD PURSUED THE SAME POLICIES THEY'D BE THIRTY THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE IN PRISON I DON'T REMEMBER THE LABEL ON THE SAINT WE MUST SEND MORE PEOPLE TO PRISON I DON'T REMEMBER THIS GOVERNMENT SAYING WE MUSTN'T MORE PEOPLE TO PRISON
WELL I MEAN THERE'S ALLSORTS OF VERSIONS OF HISTORY ONE CAN WRITE AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE POINT TO THE EARLY MID NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN LABOUR AND THE CONSERVATIVES WERE ENGAGED IN AN INCREASINGLY DESTRUCTIVE WAR ABOUT WHO COULD BE TOUGHER ON CRIME AND WE SAW A BIG DRAMATIC LONG TERM RISE IN THE PRISON POPULATION FROM ABOUT THE MID NINETIES ON SO WAS DELIBERATE POLICY
WELL I MEAN THE END OF THE DAY THE CURRENT PRISON OVERCROWDING CRISIS IS A CRISIS CREATED IN WHITEHALL BY SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS AND THE IDEA THAT IT'S PURELY UP TO JUDGES TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO GETS SENTENCED WHAT THE LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE OF PEOPLE GOT IT IS FRANKLY FANTASY POLITICIANS DECIDE TO SENTENCING FRAMEWORK THEN JUDGES IMPLEMENT IT'S OF COURSE AND LOTS OF JUDGES MAKING INDIVIDUAL SENTENCING DECISIONS WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALLY AND SCRUTINISE EACH BUT THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK IS SET BY GOVERNMENT AND WE CAN SEE THAT
YOU WERE JUST IN THE WAY THAT WE QUITE OFTEN SEE LEGISLATION WHICH PROMISES TOUGHER SENTENCES FOR THIS TOUGHER SENTENCES FOR THAT AND THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF LOTS OF SMALL DECISIONS IS THE CRISIS THAT WE CURRENTLY AND WHEN THAT WAS HAPPENING MISTER MCCLAIR MURRAY WERE YOU WERE THE GOVERNOR'S WARNING GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY HAD TO STOP DOING IT
THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION HAS FOR A QUITE A LONG TIME NOW SAID THAT THE PRISON POPULATION IS TOO LARGE WE THINK THAT SHORT SENTENCES ARE AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME AND A WASTE OF PUBLIC MONEY WE'VE SEEN AN ESCALATION IN THE LENGTH OF SENTENCES TARIFFS FOR LIFE SENTENCES AND INDETERMINATE SENTENCES FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION
HAVE INCREASED QUITE DRAMATICALLY AND ALL OF THESE THINGS HELP BUILD A VERY LARGE PRISON POPULATION WHAT RESPONSE WERE YOU GETTING FROM PEOPLE LIKE CHRIS GRAYLING I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM AT TEN PAST EIGHT WHO WAS JUSTICE MINISTER JUST A SECRETARY
I THINK MISTER GREYLING TAKES A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW HE BELIEVES THAT PRISON SENTENCES SHOULD BE LONG HE BILLY'S PRISONS SHOULD BE WILL STEER HE'S A COMPLETE HE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW TO HIS PREDECESSOR KEN CLARKE AND AGAIN THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SERVICE WE OSCILLATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS AND ITS VERY DE STABILISING FOR A SERVICE WHEN YOU CAN'T MAKE A LONG TERM PLANS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT POLITICAL INFLUENCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE FACING SO I WOULD BE A YOU KNOW AN ADVOCATE ACTUALLY HAVE HAVING A MUCH MORE SORT OF STABLE FUTURE A VERY CLEAR POLICY ABOUT WHAT SIZE OF POPULATION WE WANT AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THAT AND GO BACK TO WHERE WE CAME IN MISTER GARSIDE IF WE DON'T DO THAT IF WE DON'T CHANGE POLICY OR PUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXTRA MONEY IN WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR PRISONS LET'S PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THAT BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAD THIRTY SEVEN SUICIDES IN PRISON LAST YEAR WE HAD EIGHTY NINE
AND THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE WHAT WE FUNDAMENTALLY NEED HERE IS A COHERENT VISION FROM GOVERNMENT FOR A DOWNSIDES PRISON TO SATE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DECENCY AND RESPECT WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING I FEAR IS AN EYE CATCHING SMALL SCALE INITIATIVE AND EXPERIMENT WITH A FEW PRISONS THAT WOULD NO DOUBT PROVIDE MINISTERS WITH PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES AND CLAIMS BY THE TIME THE ELECTION BUT WON'T FUNDAMENTALLY SOLVED THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED RICHARD GARSIDE IAN MACLENNAN MARIA AS HE WILL BE TALKING TO THE FORMER JUSTICE SECRETARY OF BUSTED THAT TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE REPORTED YESTERDAY ON THE HIGHLY UNUSUAL INVESTIGATION IN BATH WHERE DETECTIVES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DISCOVER THE ORIGINS OF A SEVERED HUMAN FOOT FOUND IN A PARK
ONE PROBLEM WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF EXTRACTING D.N.A. FROM THE FOOT TO MAKING IDENTIFICATION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TODAY WE HAVE AN UPDATE AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE THINK THEY MAY HAVE AN EXPLANATION AND JOHN KAY HAS HAD EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO THEIR INVESTIGATION
IT WAS EARLY ON THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY THAT SOME DOG WALKERS FOUND THE FOOT IN SOME BUSHES HERE IN WESTON PARK EAST NOT JUST BONES BUT A COMPLETE LEFT FOOT ABOUT A SIZE FIVE OR SIX ATTACHED TO THE ANKLE AND TO ABOUT A THIRD OF THE SHIP
YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM NICKY AND SIGN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO FOUND IT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE'S FOOT IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE DURING THE NIGHT
IT WAS THIN IT WAS LONG THERE WAS SKIN IT HAD BROWN STAINS ON IT WHICH LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED
I WAS HORRIBLE SO WHOSE FOOT WAS IT AND HOW DID IT GET HERE
BECAUSE IT HADN'T REALLY DECOMPOSED MUCH AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE ASSUMED THEY'D BE ABLE TO USE D.N.A. TESTING BUT IN FACT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE GENETIC MATERIAL TO BE FANNED DETECTIVES NEEDED EXPERT ADVICE
I MEAN I'VE HAD PHONE CALLS BEFORE ABOUT BODY PARTS HAVING BEEN FOUND BUT THIS ONE WAS PARTICULARLY UNUSUAL DOCTOR HEATHER BONNEY IS A FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN LONDON SHE OFTEN HELPS POLICE EXAMINED HUMAN REMAINS SO THIS IS THE TIBIA AND THE FIBULA AND THE TIBIA THE SHINBONE AND DOCTOR BONNIE SHOWED ME A REPLICA OF THE FOOT FOUND IN BATH SHE SAID IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CUT CLEANLY BY A MECHANICAL SAW
AND SHE SAID THE STATE OF THE BONES SUGGESTED IT CAME FROM SOMEONE WHO'D STOPPED GROWING SO THEY WERE NOT IN THEIR TEENS THEY WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES OR OLDER AND THERE WAS ALSO NO SIGN OF ANY DEGENERATION INSIDE ANY OF THE JOINT MALE FEMALE RACE WE CAN'T ANSWER EITHER OF THOSE NOT FROM THESE THESE PARTS OF THE BODY
DOCTOR BONNIE WAS INTRIGUED BY THE FACT THAT THERE WAS SO LITTLE D.N.A. HER THEORY BUT THE FOOT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EMBALMED OR FIXED WITH CHEMICALS THAT COULD HAVE KILLED THE GENETIC MATERIAL
THE PRESERVATION WAS REALLY UNUSUAL IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A LIMB THAT HAS JUST BEEN SEVERED FROM THE BODY AND LEFT IN A PARK I JUST SAW IT'S ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE MEDICAL ANATOMICAL MUSEUM
SPECIMEN AFTER HEARING FROM DOCTOR BONNIE AND FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER EXPERTS POLICE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE FOOT WASN'T A RESULT OF A CRIME OR FROM A MISSING PERSON BUT WAS SOME KIND OF ANATOMICAL EXHIBIT BUT DETECTIVE INSPECTOR PAUL CATON TOLD ME HE'S STILL DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHERE IT CAME FROM
PUBLIC REALLY WANT ANSWERS I WANT ANSWERS SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO SPEAK TO NO IT MIGHT BE AN ARTS COLLEGE WHAT COULD BE A BUILDING HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED AS A SCHOOL
ASKING THEM WHETHER THEY'VE HAD ANY SELLERS THEY'VE CLEARED OUT RECENTLY THINGS LIKE THIS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE US AN INNOCENT EXPLANATION OF WHERE THIS FOOT'S COME FROM
THE THING IS EXPERTS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAY HOW LONG AGO THE FOOT WAS PRESERVED ALL WHICH CHEMICALS WERE USED WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO KNOW WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE COME FROM OR WHERE
THERE ISN'T A MEDICAL SCHOOL IN BATH AND THE HOSPITAL HERE SAYS IT HAS NEVER STORED ANATOMICAL SPECIMENS DOCTOR JOHN TROYER WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR DEATH AND SOCIETY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BATH
AS ANOTHER THEORY THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A PRIVATE COLLECTION OR OWNERSHIP OF ANATOMICAL SPECIMENS IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT COLLECT TAXIDERMY THE FOOT MIGHT HAVE BEEN STORED AS A SPECIMEN
IN SOMETHING LIKE A JAR THEY DECIDED THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY MORE THEY JUST THREW IT AWAY OR THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND THEN SOMEHOW OR OTHER ENDED UP WHERE IT WAS IN IN THAT PARK YOU'VE GOT THERE THE FROSTY GRASS BECAUSE IT AS THEY LOOK THROUGH THE PHOTOS THEY TOOK ON THEIR PHONE THAT MORNING NIKKI AND SIMON NOW HAVE SOME ANSWERS AND REASSURANCES FROM POLICE BUT UNTIL THEY KNOW MORE THEY SAY THEIR QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS WILL REMAIN IS SOMEBODY HIDING
I'M A BIT OF A CONSPIRACY THEORY SO I THINK SOMETHING IS BEING COVERED UP YOU DO WANDA IS ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY AROUND HERE WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY HARD IT'S THE UNKNOWN ISN'T IT WHICH IS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE
JOHN CAVE REPORTING FROM BATH IT'S NOW TWENTY PAST SEVEN IMPROVING SCHOOLS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND MUST BE A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF EFFORTS TO CREATE A NORTHERN POWER HOUSE THAT'S ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT OUR BUSINESS NEWS THIS MORNING IS FOREIGN ROB YOUNG WHO IS IN OLDHAM IN GREATER MANCHESTER MORNING
YES GOOD MORNING WE'RE AT THE OLD TOWN HALL IN OLDHAM WHICH IS BEING REDEVELOPED PERHAPS A SYMBOL OF THE ECONOMIC REGENERATION THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HOPES WILL TAKE PLACE ACROSS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW SAID RECENTLY THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE WILL SPLUTTER AND DIE IF YOUNGSTERS LACK THE SKILLS TO SUSTAIN IT WILL AVERAGE EXAM RESULTS IN THE NORTH ARE WORSE
THAN THOSE IN THE SOUTH A REPORT DUE OUT NEXT WEEK'S SCHOOLS IN THE NORTH RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS MONEY PER PUPIL THAN THOSE IN LONDON YOU THINK TANK I P. P. OR NORTH WILL PUBLISH ANALYSIS WHICH SAYS ON AVERAGE NORTHERN SECONDARY SCHOOLS RECEIVE THIRTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS LESS THAN THOSE IN LONDON WITH ASS'S HEAD COX THE DIRECTOR OF PEE PEE ON NORTH WHICH IS BASED HERE IN GREATER MANCHESTER GOOD MORNING MORNING WOULD CLOSING THE FUNDING GAP BETWEEN SCHOOLS IN THE NORTH AND IN LONDON ON ITS OWN CLOSE THE ATTAINMENT GAP
WELL IT DEPENDS EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD USE THE MONEY BUT WE THINK YES IT'S A HUGE AND IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT AS YOU SAY ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SPENT PER PEW
IN LONDON IN THE NORTH AND WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD IF USED PROPERLY BE A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE NEED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN REALLY GOOD QUALITY TEACHERS IN NORTHERN SCHOOLS SCHEMES LIKE TEACH FIRST ARE ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT IN DOING THAT BUT WE NEED TO SEE THAT NOW ACROSS THE BOARD AND THE GOVERNMENT IS REVIEWING ITS NATIONAL FUNDING FORMULA
WE THINK IT'S PART OF THAT PROCESS WE NEED WHAT WE CALL A POWERHOUSE PREMIUM TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND GET THE MONEY THEY DESERVE AND WITH THIS INVOLVED TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM SCHOOLS IN LONDON
DEPENDS HOW MUCH MONEY GOVERNMENT WANTS TO PUT INTO THE OVERALL EDUCATION BUDGET BUT IF WE STUCK WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY THEN YES PROBABLY THERE WOULD BE NO RE DISTRIBUTION IN THAT SENSE BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON THAT LONDON GETS MORE AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE
IT HAS A LONDON WAITING THAT'S A BIG REASON THAT IS THERE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN VERY GOOD TEACHERS IN LONDON SCHOOLS AND WE'VE SEEN THE BENEFIT OF THAT WE THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A POWERHOUSE PREMIUM YOU GET THAT SAME EFFECT IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
O.K. THANK YOU AND CONSERVE THE DIRECTOR OF I.P. P. ARE NORTH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAYS IT'S MAKING FUNDING FAIRER BY INTRODUCING A NATIONAL FUNDING FORMULA AREAS THAT THE HIGHEST NEED WILL ATTRACT THE MOST FUNDING IT SAYS IT WILL FRY TWENTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR OF NEW MONEY THROUGH ITS NORTHERN POWER HOUSE SCHOOLS STRATEGY LET ME BRING YOU JUST A BIT A BRIEF BIT OF NEWS WE'VE HAD FROM THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THIS MORNING AND THE ENERGY GIANT S.

THE INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION HAS UPHELD A COMPLAINT AGAINST A FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE SUN WHICH CLAIMED THE QUEEN BACK TO BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IT SAYS THE HEADLINE PUBLISHED IN MARCH WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE ACCOMPANYING STORY AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING SUGGESTING A FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OF THE QUEEN'S CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS
PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME MY TRUMP ALSO SAID THAT HAVE ELECTED IN NOVEMBER HE WOULD CALL FOR A RENEGOTIATION OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT IN WHICH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY COUNTRIES PLEDGED TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS
THE OPPOSITION IN VENEZUELA HAS CALLED ON PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN NEW PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND MET A WORSENING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS PRESIDENT NIKOLAOS ASTHMA DOURO WHO DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY LAST WEEK HAS ACCUSED THE UNITED STATES OF TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE A CAMPAIGN TO CREATE CHAOS AND OVERTHROW HIM
THE LAST LABOUR LEADER CARWYN JONES WILL BE REAPPOINTED AS FIRST MINISTER TODAY AFTER A DEAL WITH CLYDE COME TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE FORMATION OF A NEW WELSH GOVERNMENT LABOUR IS THE BIGGEST PARTY AFTER THE RECENT ASSEMBLY ELECTION BUT IT FAILED TO WIN AN OVERALL MAJORITY
THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT QUEEN BAGS BRICKS IT WAS THE HEADLINE DOMINATING THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN ON THE NINTH OF MARCH A STRIKING CLAIM AND ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING ONE THAT IS THE JUDGEMENT OF THE NEWSPAPER REGULATOR IPSO IT'S UPHELD A COMPLAINT FROM BUCKINGHAM PALACE
BUT THAT HEADLINE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT OF THE ARTICLE AND SAID THAT THE IDEA THAT THE QUEEN BACKS BRICKS IT WAS CONJECTURE NONE OF THOSE QUOTED IN THE STORY WERE REPORTED AS MAKING SUCH A CLAIM THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE SUN TONY GALLAGHER'S IN A RADIO CAR GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING DID YOU APPROVE THE HEADLINE THAT DAY
YES I DID BUT BEFORE I BEGIN CAN I CORRECT SOME ASSERTIONS THAT STEVE HEWLETT MADE THIS MORNING STEVE HEWLETT SAID THAT THE PALACE ONLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE HEADLINE IN FACT THE PALACE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE STORY AND THE STORY HAS BEEN EXONERATED
IT'S ONLY WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE STORY WAS GOING TO BE EXONERATED THAT THE PALACE NARROWED ITS CLAIM TO THE HEADLINE AND THE HEADLINE IS ONLY MISLEADING IF YOU EXCLUDE THE WORDS BOMBSHELL CLAIM OVER EUROPE VOTE WHICH ARE IN CAPITAL LETTERS ON THE FRONT PAGE I EMPHASISE THE WORD CLAIM THE BOMBSHELL CLAIM OVER EUROPE VOTE SO THEY REACH THAT RULING BY DISREGARDING THOSE WORDS THE SECOND THING THAT STEVE HEWLETT
SAID WHICH IS ALSO INCORRECT IS THAT NICK CLEGG I DENIED THE STORY IN POINT OF FACT NICK CLEGG HAD A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DENY THE STORY BEFORE IT WENT TO PRINT AND HE DIDN'T DO THAT LETTER LETTER NO I LIKE DOING THAT LOOK AT THIS FINISH LET ME FINISH IF YOU IF YOU WERE THE ONLY DENY THE STORY AFTER IT CREATED A FEW RAW AND AFTER HAVING SOME CONSULTATION WITH PALACE
SO HAVING CORRECTED THAT I ONCE WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU O.K. WELL AT IT IT IS THAT THE HEADLINE THAT THAT THAT THAT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A BREACH OF THE EDITORS' CODE OF PRACTICE SO YOU ACCEPT THEN THAT YOU PERSONALLY MADE A JOURNALISTIC ERROR IN A PROVING THAT HEADLINE
I DON'T EXPECT THAT WE MADE AN ERROR AT ALL WE MADE A JUDGEMENT THAT AND THE HEADLINE WAS RIGHT AND THAT IT WAS BACKED UP BY THE STORY WE KNEW MORE THAT WE PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THE SOURCES WERE SO IMPECCABLE THAT WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN THE STORY IN THE WAY THAT WE DID QUEEN
BACK'S BRICKS IT WAS NOT YOU YOU'VE ACCEPTED THE JUDGEMENT OF IPSO WHICH HAS FOUND THAT THAT HEADLINE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TEXT IT WAS AN ACT OF COURSE
WE'RE MEMBERS OF IT SO WE RESPECT THE ABSURD CODE AND THAT'S WHY WE PUBLISH THEIR JUDGEMENT IN IN FULL YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I ACCEPT WE MADE A MISTAKE IN ALL CONSCIENCE I DON'T AND I DON'T THINK WHERE I DOING THIS AGAIN TOMORROW I WOULD ACT IN ANY WAY DIFFERENTLY WHATSOEVER GIVEN WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THE SOURCING AND GIVEN WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THE CONVERSATION
FRANKLY WE WOULD BE BETTER PACKING UP AND GOING HOME AS JOURNALISTS WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY PUT THESE THINGS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHY DID YOU NOT IF YOU BELIEVE SO STRONGLY THAT THAT WAS THE CASE WHY DO YOU EVEN ANONYMOUSLY NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU REFERRED TO IN YOUR ARTICLE SAID THAT THE QUEEN BACK TO EXIT
I CAN ASSURE YOU WE WERE LEFT IN NO DOUBT THAT THE QUEEN BACK TO LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT I DIDN'T YOURSELF AS IN THE STUDY OF THE PIECE IT'S SELF EVIDENTLY WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPROMISE THE PEOPLE THAT TOLD US THAT WE WERE IN NO DOUBT THAT THE QUEEN'S VIEWS WERE STRONGLY OF THE OPINION YOU SHE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY THAT THAT WELL YOU'VE BEEN FOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLED YOUR READERS IT SO FOR EXAMPLE LOOKED AT THE STORY THAT YOU PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR WHICH WAS HEADLINED ONE IN FIVE BRIT MUSLIM SYMPATHY FOR JIHAD EASE AND IT AND IT FOUND THAT THAT WAS YOU HAD FAILED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE CARE AND ITS PRESENTATION OF OF THE RESULTS OF THE POLL TO WHICH THAT STORY REFERRED
OR YOUR COVERAGE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING AGAIN A BREACH OF CLAUSE ONE WITCHES WITCHES ACCURACY THAT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE ISN'T IT SIGNIFICANT MISLEADING YOUR READERS IT IS TO THEM THAT YOU HAVE A DUTY OF RESPONSIBILITY
WE'VE GOT A DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO HER READERS AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT THE STORIES IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT SELF REGULATION WITH PART OF THE CODE WE'VE SIGNED UP TO SELF REGULATION SO WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY THEIR JUDGEMENT I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT IN TERMS OF ADVERSE IF SO JUDGEMENTS WE ARE SOME WAY BELOW A NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONAL NEWSPAPER GROUPS I THINK HAVE GOT SEVEN OR EIGHT COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM WE'VE ONLY GOT TWO OR THREE I THINK
IT SHOWS THAT A SELF REGULATION WORKS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE CODE NO BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ABOUT WHAT IF SO HAS SAID FOR EXAMPLE ISN'T SERIOUS CASE IN WHICH THE FORMER EDITOR OF THE NEWSPAPER DAVID MOORE WAS A CONVICTED OF BREACHING THE SEXUAL OFFENCES ACT IN MARCH BECAUSE A PIXELATED PHOTOGRAPH OF THE FOOTBALLER ADAM JOHNSON'S TEENAGE VICTIM WAS PRINTED AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PIXELATED THE JUDGE FOUND THAT SHE COULD STILL HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH HER FACEBOOK PROFILE
THAT WAS A GIANT SHIT YOUR APPRECIATE THAT WAS BEFORE I JOINED THE PAPER BUT I THINK MOST MEDIA COMMENTATORS ACCEPTED THAT THE SUN TOOK EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN IN QUESTION WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AND THE THE COURT FOR ITS OWN REASONS FOUND THAT THOSE STEPS EXTRAORDINARY STEPS WERE WE'RE NOT SUFFICIENT
TONY GALLAGHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY TO EIGHT TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE MALE CLAIMS THAT THE S.N.P. M.P. ANGUS MACNEIL HAS REPEATEDLY CLAIMED EXPENSES GOT A HOTEL ROOM IN LONDON WHERE IT IS ALLEGED HE HAD AN AFFAIR WHILE HE WAS LETTING OUT HIS FLAT IN THE CITY HE QUOTES THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS IN PUBLIC LIFE SO ALISTAIR GRAHAM SAYING THAT CONSTITUENTS WILL BE DEEPLY SHOCKED AS IF SOMEONE OWNS A FLAT IN LONDON THEY SHOULD NOT BE BOOSTING THEIR INCOME BY RENTING IT OUT WHILE CHARGING HOTEL BILLS TO TAXPAYERS MY MEALS HE DOES NOT LIKE
COMMENT ON HIS PERSONAL LIFE AND S. M. P. SPOKESMAN AND STILL THE BABE OF THE DIGEST ANY FINANCIAL IMPROPRIETIES TOTALLY WRONG THE MINUTE ALSO RUNS THE STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE WITH THE HEADLINE CHEATING EM PEAS SEX ON EXES THE SUN IN ITS LEAD SAYS BORIS JOHNSON'S WIFE IS THE SUBJECT OF A VICIOUS SEX SMEAR CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO DERAIL HIS CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT SAYS FALSE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SWIRLING AROUND WESTMINSTER AND ONLINE THAT MARINA WHEELER WAS THE Q.C. CAUGHT IN A DRUNKEN CLINCH WITH ANOTHER LAWYER AT WATERLOO STATION LAST SUMMER
IT QUOTES AN UNNAMED MINISTER CALLING THE SLAYER'S PURE POISON THE GUARDIAN SAYS HOPES ARE RISING THAT THE BITTER JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE IN ENGLAND WILL SOON BE OVER WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TODAY THE TALKS HAVE PRODUCED A COMPROMISE DEAL IT SAYS A REVISED CONTRACT WILL BE PUBLISHED FOLLOWING TEN DAYS OF POSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS INVOLVING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE DOCTORS' UNION HER SAUCE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISCUSSIONS IS QUOTED SAYING WE'RE NEARLY THERE
THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS THE COMPETITION IN MARKETS HAVE THIRTY HAS DUCKED THE CHANCE TO CRACK DOWN ON THE BANKING SECTOR AND SOME OF ITS EXORBITANT CHARGES THE PAPER SAYS THAT IN OPTING NOT TO IMPOSE A CEILING ON OVERDRAFT CHARGES THE REGULATOR LOOKS INEFFECTUAL THE TIME SAYS THE SHARE PRICES OF THE BIG BANKS JUMPED AFTER YESTERDAY'S C.M.A. REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IT QUOTES THE WHICH CONSUMER GROUP DISMISSING THE PROPOSALS AS A REMEDIAL TINKERING THE GUARDIAN SAYS EXPECTATIONS OF THE BANKING INVESTIGATION WILLOW AND THE REGULATOR BARELY MET THEM
IT SAYS THE AUTHORITY IS HITTING THE BANKS WITH A FEATHER THE TIMES HAS A DISPATCH FROM SYRIA'S THIRD CITY HOMES IT SAYS THAT AFTER YEARS OF WAR LIFE IS SLOWLY RETURNING ITS CORRESPONDENT WENT TO A RE OPENED SWEET SHOP INCONGRUOUS HE WROTE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF BOMBS SCARRED BUILDINGS WHICH BOASTS A CARAMEL MACHINE MADE IN LEEDS IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX THE MACHINE WAS WORKING WONDERFULLY SAYS THE OWNER BUT THE MOTOR WAS STOLEN WHEN THE AREA WAS UNDER REBEL CONTROL
THE B.B.C.'S DECISION TO SHUT ITS RECIPES WEBSITE IS WIDELY REPORTED IN COMMENTED UPON THE HAIRY BIKER DAVID MYERS TELLS THE MIRROR IT'S RIDICULOUS I USE THE SITE MYSELF LOTS OF PEOPLE DO IT'S GOOD THE F.T. SAYS THAT FOR A MOMENT THE NATION THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO RUSTLE UP ANOTHER BUTTER CHICKEN CURRY UNTIL THE CORPORATION RESPONDED TO PROTEST BY PROMISING TO PUT THE RECIPES ON THE WEBSITE RUN BY ITS COMMERCIAL ARM THE DAILY MAIL WONDERS WHETHER IN ITS WORDS THE DRAMATIC U. TURN WAS PART OF A CYNICAL STUNT TO DRAW AN INEVITABLE PUBLIC BACKLASH
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WE ARE ON COURSE FOR WAR WITH RUSSIA BY NEXT YEAR THAT IS THE CHILLING WARNING IN A BOOK WRITTEN BY GENERAL SIR RICHARD CHERVIL HAS JUST RETIRED AS ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR SOLDIERS IN NATO DEPUTY SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER IN EUROPE HE'S WITH ME GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HE WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THE BOOK IS A BOOK OF IT'S A WORK OF FICTION BUT THE EVENTS I DESCRIBE OUR ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE
AND HOW WOULD IT COME ABOUT I THINK FROM A PERCEPTION OF WEAKNESS FROM THE WEST I THINK WE NEED TO JUDGE A PRESIDENT PUTIN BY HIS DEEDS NOT HIS WORDS HE'S INVADED GEORGIA HE'S INVADED THE CRIMEA HE'S INVADED UKRAINE HE'S SEEING THAT FORCE IS HE GET HE IS HE HAS GOT AWAY WITH IT
AND IN A PERIOD OF TENSION I THINK AN ATTACK ON THE BALTIC STATES THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THIS IS ABOUT THE BALTIC STATES OF THEIR VULNERABILITY SUCH AN ATTACK IT'S ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE HE WOULD ARGUE OBVIOUSLY DOES ARGUE THAT WHAT HE'S DOING IS RECLAIMING WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE TERRITORY WAS RUSSIA'S AND THAT I WAS HEARTLAND IN MANY GET YOURSELF AND THE DYNAMIC HE STARTED IN UKRAINE IN CRIMEA INDICATES THAT OF COURSE WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT
LITHUANIA ESTONIA AND INDEED LATVIA HAVE SIGNIFICANT ETHNIC RUSSIAN SPEAKING POPULATION TONIGHT NOW THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN LOYAL CITIZENS OF THOSE COUNTRIES BUT THE WAY THAT THE KREMLIN
PROPAGANDA MACHINE HAS DEMONSTRATED HE CAN MANIPULATE MINORITIES GET UNDER THE SKIN MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND WE NEED TO TAKE BE READY TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION WE NEED TO RECOGNISE THE VOLATILITY OF THOSE BUT NOT YOU SAY NOT LEAVE THAT ACTION UNTIL IT HAS HAPPENED LOVE DOES HAPPEN HOW DO SOMETHING NOW WHAT SHOULD THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NOT I'LL BE THE PURPOSE IN THE WAY OF THE BOOK IS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND TO AVERT POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE
WHAT WE WANT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN WELL NATO SHOULD BE DOING WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT IT WAS SET UP TO DO EFFECTIVE DETERRENTS AND THEY CAN DO THAT AND THIS MEANS PERMANENTLY BASED FORCES MORE FORCES IN AND AROUND THE BALTIC STATES BECAUSE WHAT NATO NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO RAISE THE BAR SUFFICIENTLY HIGH
FOR ANY AGGRESSOR TO SAY IT'S SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE BAR IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT BUT WOULDN'T HAVE THAT RAISING THE BAR AS YOU PUT IT WOULDN'T THAT BE ANOTHER SOME WOULD SAY YET ANOTHER PROVOCATION TO PUTIN I THINK NO MORE PROVOCATIVE THAN YOUR EYES
PUTTING UP WARNING OF ALARM LIGHTS AND ENSURING OUR DOORS ARE LOCKED THESE ARE NATO COUNTRIES THEY'RE LOYAL NATO MEMBERS AND IT'S NATO'S DUTY AND PURPOSE TO DEFEND ITS MEMBERS AND THE WAY TO AVERT POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE AS I SAY IS EFFECTIVE DETERRENTS AND IF PUTIN THEN
DEFENDED AS HE WOULD PUT IT DEFENDED RUSSIA'S INTERESTS BY ATTACKING THOSE FORCES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE WOULD BE AT WAR WE WOULD BE AT WAR THE CHILLING FACT IS THAT BECAUSE RUSSIA HARD WAS NUCLEAR THINKING INTO THE NUCLEAR CAPABILITY AND THINKING INTO EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR DEFENCE CAPABILITY
THIS WOULD BE NUCLEAR WAR WHICH IS WHY I COME BACK TO THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN WE'VE ENJOYED PEACE IN EUROPE FOR SEVENTY YEARS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY PEACE AND AS I SAY THE WAY TO AVERT THIS IS THROUGH EFFECTIVE DETERRENTS ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WAY AND THAT IS ACCOMMODATING PUTIN TO A MUCH GREATER DEGREE THAN WE HAVE AS YOU VERY WELL KNOW HAVING BEEN TO RUSSIA THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA DO FEEL EMBATTLED OFTEN THEY'D THEY'D FEEL ENCIRCLED BY ENEMIES THEY'VE HAD DONE HISTORICALLY FOR CENTURIES NOT
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WHAT PUTIN WOULD ARGUE WAS THAT WE MUST PROTECT RUSSIA'S INTERESTS IF WE WERE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO HIS CONCERNS MIGHT THIS NOT ALL BE AVOIDED RUSSIA AS A GREAT NATION AND WE MUST WE MUST LIVE WITH RUSSIA BUT I THINK IT'S A TWO IT'S A IT'S A DOUBLE TRUCKS DOUBLE TRACKED STRATEGY OF OF HOLDING UP A VERY LARGE STOP SIGN SAYING THUS FAR PERHAPS BUT ABSOLUTE YOU KNOW FATHER
BUT AT THE SAME TIME BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP THROUGH DIALOGUE NOT UNCONDITIONAL DIALOGUE RUSSIA MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL LAW RECOGNISED THAT THE USE OF FORCE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE RECOGNISE THAT VULNERABLE COUNTRIES ON ITS PERIPHERY NEED GUARANTEES OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY
BUT I THINK DETERRENTS COMBINED WITH THAT SORT OF CONDITIONAL DIALOGUE IS ABSOLUTELY THE WAY THE OTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT THERE WAS THAT BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IT'S YOUR SIMULTANEOUSLY SENDING IN THE TANKS I THINK BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP IS EASIER IF WE'RE ALL CLEAR ABOUT WHERE WE STAND AND WHEN YOU SAY SENDING ATTACKS I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESTABLISHING CREDIBLE DEFENCE FORCES IN THOSE IN THOSE BALTIC STATES IN AND AROUND IN THE EUPHEMISM
IT'S ALL EUPHEMISM IT'S A FACT IT'S A RIVER AS LONG AS LONG AS WE HAVE CREDIBLE CAPABLE JOINED UP FORCES IN A POSITION TO RAISE THE BAR SUFFICIENTLY HIGH THAT ANY RISK OF WAR IS MINIMISED THEN I THINK WE CAN GET ON AND BUILD A RELATIONSHIP GENERALS FROM LITERATURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BOOK IS CALLED TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAR WITH RUSSIA THANK YOU
IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A TUNBRIDGE WELLS STUDIO THIS MORNING IS TIM STANLEY HISTORIAN AND WRITER FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ROBOTS ARE INCREASINGLY ARE PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT THE LONDON SCIENCE MUSEUM IS PLANNING A MAJOR EXHIBIT OF AUTOMATONS NEXT YEAR
WHAT IS SURPRISING IS THE ONE OF THE STAR ATTRACTIONS IS A MEDIEVAL CLOCKWORK MONK BUILT FOR A PURPOSE WE DON'T OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH ROBOTS PRAYER
THE ORIGINS OF THIS SO CALLED ROBO FRIAR LIAR IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND EXOTIC AGE OF RELIGIOUS FERVOUR AND IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE SOMETIMES BIZARRE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WILL DO IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR GOD
IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO DON CARLOS THE HEIR TO THE THRONE OF SPAIN FELL DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND INTO A COMA
KING PHILIP THE SECOND WAS DESPERATE TO SAVE HIS ONLY SON HE EVEN DUG UP THE BODY OF A SAINTLY FRIAR WHO HAD DIED A CENTURY BEFORE AND LAID OUT HIS MOULDERING SKELETON ON THE PATIENT'S BED
PHILIP MADE A PACT WITH GOD SPARE THIS BOY'S LIFE AND I WILL BUILD YOU A MIRACLE
DON CARLOS RECOVERED HE TOLD HIS FATHER THAT DURING HIS COMA HE HAD BEEN COMFORTED BY AN APPARITION A FRIAR CARRYING A SMALL WOODEN CROSS
SO PHILIP COMMISSIONED ONE ELLO TORIANO A CLOCKMAKER TO CONSTRUCT A PRAYER MACHINE MODELLED ON THAT VISION
TORIANO ROBO FRIARS STANDS AT FIFTEEN INCHES TALL AND IT'S MADE OF WOOD AND IRON WIND IT UP AND IT'S SKATES AROUND IN A SLOW CIRCLE ITS RIGHT ARM BEATING ITS CHEST IT'S MOUTH MOVING IN SILENT PRAYER
IT'S LEFT ARM RAISES AND LOWERS A ROSARY THE MACHINE'S EYES FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENT OCCASIONALLY IT LIFTS THE BEADS TO ITS LIPS AND KISSES THEM
PHILIP'S BALD HEADED MIRACLE IS TERRIFYING TO LOOK AT BUT EVEN IF THE ROBO FRIAR IS UGLY ON THE OUTSIDE TO RHIANA'S INTERNAL CLOCKWORK WAS ELABORATELY BEAUTIFULLY CARVED
WHY DID HE BOTHER TO RENDER SOMETHING THAT WAS INVISIBLE TO HUMAN EYES SO EXQUISITE
SOME EXPERTS SPECULATE IT WAS BECAUSE TORIANO TORIANO ONLY INTENDED THE WORKINGS TO BE VIEWED BY GOD
NOWADAYS WE OFTEN THINK OF ART AS A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE WE GENERALLY CREATE THINGS IN ORDER THAT THEY BE SEEN THE ROBO FRIAR BELONGS TO A DIFFERENT ETHIC
IF REPRESENTS ART NOT FOR POPULAR CONSUMPTION BUT ART AS A PRIVATE ACT OF WORSHIP
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE ONE OF THE GREATEST GIFTS OF FAITH IS THIS VERY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IN WHICH THEY DO WHAT THEY DO QUIETLY WITHOUT SEEKING TO TROUBLE OTHERS
THE ROBO FRIARS UNEXPECTED INTERNAL SPLENDOUR TURNS OUT NOT ONLY TO BE A GREAT METAPHOR FOR A LIFE OF PRAYER
BUT ALSO A REMINDER THAT WONDERFUL THINGS DONE PRIVATELY BIDET THE CREATION OF ART OR JUST A KIND ACT ALWAYS HAVE INTRINSIC VALUE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH TIN STANLEY THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT SHOULD ABORTION BE ENTIRELY REMOVED FROM THE CRIMINAL LAW THAT IS WHAT THE BRITISH PREGNANCY ADVISORY SERVICE IS CAMPAIGNING FOR SAYING THAT IT SHOULD BE GOVERNED IN LINE WITH OTHER MEDICAL PROCEDURES THROUGH ETHICS AND REGULATIONS RATHER THAN THE CRIMINAL LAW AT THE MOMENT WOMEN AND DOCTORS CAN FACE PROSECUTION OVER ABORTIONS TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT LAW WHICH ALLOWS THEM UP TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS UNLESS THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO MOTHER OR CHILD
POSITION IN NORTHERN IRELAND IS DIFFERENT THIS WEEK THE CAMPAIGN WAS BACKED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES CAUSING ANGER FROM SOME OF ITS MEMBERS WILL JOIN THE STUDIO BY AND FOR EDDIE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE BRITISH PREGNANCY ADVISORY SERVICE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY SHOULD ABORTION BE FULLY DECRIMINALISED
WELL THE LAW AS IT STANDS AT THE MOMENT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR FIFTY YEARS IT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES TO PROVIDE EXCEPTION TO ABORTION BEING CRIMINAL AND I THINK THAT TODAY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WOMEN CAN MAKE AND RIGHTLY DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THEIR PREGNANCIES AND
THE DECISION ABOUT THE FUTURE SHOULD BE IN GRAS HANDS SO THE EFFECT WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE TWENTY FOUR WEEK LEGAL LIMIT WHICH IS WHICH IS THAT THE PRESENT POSITION WHERE IN AN ETHICAL OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHERE WOULD YOU THEN DRAW THE LINE IN IN TERMS OF WHEN IT AN ABORTION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT OR CAN BE CARRIED OUT
WELL I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE LEGAL LIMIT ON ABORTION A LIMIT THAT'S PRETTY ARBITRARILY SET BY POLITICIANS ACTUALLY PLAYS A REALLY SMALL
TINY VANISHING INDEED IF ANY ROLE IN ESTABLISHING WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE VERY LATE ABORTIONS WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ABORTIONS AT THAT STAGE IN PREGNANCY DOCTORS DON'T WANT TO DO THEM AND IN FACT IN SCOTLAND THERE WAS NO UPPER TIME LIMIT ON ABORTION UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY AND NO MORE OCEAN SO CARRIED OUT OF THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD WANT NO POINT NO NO
I THINK ANY WEEKS LIMIT I THINK THAT THESE THINGS ARE BEST FAT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
AND BY WOMEN POLITICIANS SHOULDN'T REALLY HAVE A ROLE IN IT AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS THERE A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PREGNANT FEE WHEN AT TWENTY THREE WEEKS AND FOUR DAYS AND ONE THAT'S AT TWENTY FOUR WEEKS AND TWO DAYS AND YET THAT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN CAN END A PREGNANT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN THAT SORT OF POINT AROUND THE TWENTY FOUR WEAK POINT AND TWENTY EIGHT WEEKS OR THIRTY WEEKS OR LATER
WELL WHO REALLY ASKS FOR ABORTIONS AT TWENTY EIGHT WEEKS OR THIRTY WEEKS WITHOUT THERE BEING A REALLY COMPELLING REASON IT'S THE LAND OF FANTASY THERE'S WOMEN DON'T EXIST BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THE LEGAL LIMIT
THAT IS THAT THE PROBLEM THAT EXISTS ARE THOSE AROUND THE MARGINS OF TWENTY FOUR WEEKS AND THAT SHOULD REALLY BE AN ISSUE FOR DOCTORS IF THE DOCTOR THINKS IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT'S CLINICALLY IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE WOMAN THEN I REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD BE FREE TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOT HELD BACK BY DECISIONS THAT PARLIAMENT
HAVE TAKEN WILL LET ME TURN TO DOCTOR JOHN WYATT IS ALSO WITH US IN THE STUDIO EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF NEO NATAL PAEDIATRICS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON YOU'VE WORKED ON CARING FOR VERY PREMATURE BABIES FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THAT PERIOD I IMAGINE IMMENSE AMOUNT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO AT WHAT STAGE OF GESTATION
YES INDEED AND AS A TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES WERE ABLE TO KEEP ALIVE BABIES AT YOUNGER AND YOUNGER GESTATIONAL AGES THERE ARE SOME ABSOLUTE BIOLOGICAL LIMITS TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LUNGS THE OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS SO
THE THE ADVANCES HAVE BEEN INCREMENTAL OVER THE OVER THE LAST YEARS BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE AT NOW FOR BABIES TO SURVIVE AROUND THE LIMITS OF VIABILITY AT TWENTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WEEKS AND EVEN OCCASIONALLY LESS THAN THAT
AND MANY OF US BABIES WORLD GROW UP AND DO EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN BUT BUT MANY OF THOSE BABIES NOT NECESSARILY LIVE IN FULL HEALTH OR HAVE ENJOYED GOOD HEALTH FOR THE CERTAINLY AN INCREASED RISK OF OF OF LONG TERM PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY OF BRAIN INJURY OF VARIOUS KINDS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ACTUALLY THE NUMBER OF BABIES WHO SURVIVE ARE VERY SEVERE DISABILITIES IT IS THANKFULLY RELATIVELY SMALL
SADLY A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF BABIES BORN AT THE LIMITS OF VIABILITY WILL DIE WHATEVER WE DO ABOUT A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER UP TO FIFTY PER CENT OR MORE WILL BE LIVING WITHOUT
EITHER COMPLETELY FREE OF ANY KIND OF IMPAIRMENT OR WITH A RELATIVELY MINOR IMPAIRMENTS THAT DOESN'T REALLY INTERFERE WITH THEIR LINE AND TO DO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WARTS AND FOR EDDIE'S PUTTING FORWARD IN TERMS OF PEOPLE SUCH AS YOURSELF DOCTORS AND THE WOMEN CONCERNED BEING ABLE TO DECIDE THEMSELVES ON ON ON THE STAGE AT WHICH AN ABORTION CAN TAKE PLACE RATHER THAN THE LAW COMING INTO IT
I BELIEVE THE LAW HAS A ROLE BECAUSE THE LAW EXPRESSED AS WHAT WE AS A SOCIETY BELIEVE ABOUT THE VALUE OF LIFE AS IT DOES IN MANY OTHER AREAS AND THE WHOLE AREA OF NEONATAL CARE IS IS BASED ON ON THE IDEA THAT THESE LIVES ARE PRECIOUS THAT IT'S WORTH INVESTING AND DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GIVE A BABY A CHANCE AND SO I THINK THAT THE IDEA THAT DOCTORS WOULD HAVE NO LEGAL GUIDANCE THAT THIS WOULD BE SIMPLY A MATTER OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE AND OF
THERE WERE THE WISHES OF A WOMAN I FEEL IT IS NOT THE WAY THAT OUR SOCIETY SHOULD BE DEVELOPING IN THE FUTURE SOMEONE HUGH IF HIS VOCATION IS TO DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FOR AN UNBORN CHILD HOW WHAT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ABORTION
WHEN IT CLEARLY I RECOGNISE THE FACT THAT THAT AS A DEMOCRATIC DECISION IS THAT WOMEN TO HAVE A CHOICE HOW ABOUT ABORTION TICK IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT MY COMMITMENT AND THOSE OF MANY PEOPLE I WORK WITH IS THAT WE SHOULD GIVE THE VERY BEST CHANCE VERY SMALL BUT IT IS AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE BECOMES THAT THE CO EXISTENCE OF THESE TWO ACTIVITIES OF THE ONES WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE TIME LITTLE BABIES AND AT THE SAME TIME
WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO BE FOR THEIR LIVES TO BE THAT THAT CREATES A KIND OF MORAL CONFUSION AND CONCERN AND DISTRESS DOCTOR JOHN WYATT AND FOR EDDIE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST LOUISE

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE EIGHTEENTH HAVE MADE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE FAR REACHING CHANGES TO THE RUNNING OF PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT OR THIS MORNING A CHARITY SAYS THERE'S BEEN A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CARERS AGED OVER EIGHTY THE PRESS WATCHDOG HAS UPHELD A COMPLAINT AGAINST A HEADLINE IN THE SUN WHICH CLAIMED THE QUEEN BACKED A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE E.U.
THE OPPOSITION IN VENEZUELA HAS CALLED ON PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS OR NEW PROTEST AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AS THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC CRISIS DEEPENS THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
A SHAKE UP OF THE PRISON SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES DESCRIBED BY MINISTERS AS THE BIGGEST SINCE THE VICTORIAN ERA WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THIS MORNING'S QUEEN'S SPEECH UNDER THE PROPOSALS PRISON GOVERNORS WILL BE GIVEN FAR GREATER CONTROLS OVER THEIR BUDGET AND EDUCATION PROGRAMMES THE GOVERNMENT IS LAYING OUT ITS AGENDA FOR THE COMING YEAR WITH THE CONSERVATIVES BITTERLY DIVIDED OVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
NUMBER TEN WANT THIS QUEEN'S SPEECH TO BE SEEN AS THE LAUNCH PAD FOR MISTER CAMERON SOCIAL REFORM AGENDA IT WILL THEREFORE INCLUDE MEASURES ON PRISON REFORM IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR THOSE LEAVING CARE SWIFTER PROCEDURES FOR ADOPTION AND A RENEWED CRACKDOWN ON SO CALLED HATE PREACHERS THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED IT AS A PROGRAMME TO BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY
IT IS THOUGH A QUEEN SPEECH OVERSHADOWED BY THE INCREASINGLY BITTER E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY STRIPPED OF MEASURES THAT MIGHT FURTHER INFLAMED TENSIONS AND REBELLIONS WITHIN THE TORY PARTY SO PLANS FOR THEIR LONG MOOTED AND CONTROVERSIAL BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS WILL NOW BE PUT OFF FOR YET FURTHER CONSULTATION
THE AIM OF DOWNING STREET IT WOULD APPEAR IS TO AVOID FLASHPOINT SUCH AS ERUPTED IN THE WAKE OF THE BUDGET WHICH ENABLED BRICKS IT'S CAMPAIGNERS TO COMBINE WITH TORY REBELS TO INFLICT DEFEAT AND DAMAGE ON MISTER CAMERON LABOUR PREDICTED THE QUEEN'S SPEECH WOULD CONSIST ONLY OF FROTH AND SHOULD'VE BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM
DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID THAT FOR TOO LONG PRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT TO FESTER AND THEY CAN NO LONGER ACT AS WAREHOUSES FOR CRIMINALS THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING A PILOT SCHEME IN ENGLAND TO TRY A NEW APPROACH HAS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE EXPLAINS
THE OVERHAUL OF THE WAY PRISONS ARE MANAGED WAS FIRST OUTLINED THREE MONTHS AGO BY DAVID CAMERON WHO DESCRIBED IT AS AN AGENDA FOR A REVOLUTION IN SIX JAILS INCLUDING ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST WANDSWORTH IN SOUTH LONDON GOVERNORS WILL HAVE CONTROL OVER BUDGETS DECIDE WHICH REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION SERVICES TO USE AND BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE PRISON REGIME
THE OTHER PILOT PRISONS INCLUDE RAN IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE WHICH INSPECTORS HAVE WARNED HE'S AT RISK OF BEING OVERWHELMED BY THE SUPPLY OF SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS AND COLD DINGLY IN SURREY WHERE LAST MONTH THE PRISONER WAS MURDERED CRITICS SAY THE PROPOSALS WON'T HELP DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF OVERCROWDING VIOLENCE AND SELF HARM BUT THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO GO FURTHER ALLOWING PRISONERS TO BECOME INDEPENDENT LEGAL ENTITIES ABLE TO GENERATE AND RETAIN INCOME
THE WELSH LABOUR LEADER CARWYN JONES WILL BE REAPPOINTED AS FIRST MINISTER TODAY AFTER A DEAL WITH PLAID COME TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK WHICH HAS PREVENTED THE FORMATION OF A NEW WELSH GOVERNMENT LABOUR IS THE BIGGEST PARTY AFTER THE RECENT ASSEMBLY ELECTION BUT IT FAILED TO WIN AN OVERALL MAJORITY
THE CHARITY H.Q. CASE SAY THERE'S BEEN A STEEP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AGED OVER EIGHTY WHO ARE ACTING AS CARERS IT SAYS NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED BY NEARLY FORTY PERCENT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THE CHARITY'S DIRECTOR CAROLINE ABRAHAMS WAS ELDERLY CARERS NEED MORE SUPPORT
PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER AND SO WE'VE GOT MORE COUPLES AGEING INTO THEIR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES TOGETHER AND HELPING OUT EACH OTHER AND FOR THEM PARTICULARLY IF ONE OF THEM BECOME SERIOUSLY ILL THAT PLACE IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY ON THE OTHER THEY MAY BE CARING NOT ONLY ALL DAY BUT SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT HAVING TO GET UP TO HELP PEOPLE GET TO THE LOO OR IF THEY BECOME DISTRESSED AND PEOPLE DO THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT A POINT IS THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT ALL ON THEIR OWN
THE INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION HAS UPHELD A COMPLAINT AGAINST A FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE SUN WHICH CLAIMED THE QUEEN BACK TO BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IT SAYS THE HEADLINE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE ACCOMPANYING STORY AND WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING THE NEWSPAPER HAS PUBLISHED THE FINDING ON PAGE TWO THIS MORNING AND HEADLINED THE RULING AT THE FOOT OF ITS FRONT PAGE ANDREW FACT REPORTS
EXCLUSIVE BOMBSHELL CLAIM OVER EUROPE THOUGHT SAID THE SUN ON MARCH THE NINTH QUEEN BACKS BRECHT'S IT ON THE INSIDE PAGES TWO UNNAMED SOURCES CLAIM THAT THE QUEEN HAD MADE CRITICAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE E.U. IT TO PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
BUCKINGHAM PALACE COMPLAINED THAT THE SUN HEADLINE HAD BREACHED CLAUSE ONE ACCURACY IS THE EDITORS' CODE OF PRACTICE THAT COMPLAINT HAS BEEN UPHELD BUT SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE SUN'S EDITOR IN CHIEF TONY GALLAGHER WAS UNREPENTANT YOU'RE ASKING ME IF I ACCEPT WE MADE A MISTAKE IN ALL CONSCIENCE I DON'T AND I DON'T THINK WHERE I DOING THIS AGAIN TOMORROW I WOULD ACT IN ANY WAY DIFFERENTLY WHATSOEVER
THE INDEPENDENT PRESS STANDARDS ORGANISATION SAYS THAT ORDERING THE SON TO PUBLISH ITS RULING IS A REMEDY FOR THE MISLEADING HEADLINE BUT THE PAPER IN EFFECT REPEATS THE HEADLINE IN TODAY'S LEADING ARTICLE
DOES THE QUEEN BACK BRECHT'S IT IT ASKS WE'RE SURE SHE DOES
THE OPPOSITION IN VENEZUELA HAS CALLED ON PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN NEW PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT MADE A WORSENING ECONOMIC CRISIS THE EMBATTLED PRESIDENT NICOLAS MEDORO HAS ACCUSED THE UNITED STATES OF TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE A CAMPAIGN TO OVERTHROW HIM OUR CORRESPONDENT WHERE A DAVIS IS IN THE CAPITAL CARACAS

ALTHOUGH VENEZUELA HAS SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OIL RESERVES ITS ECONOMY IS IN TATTERS WITH CHRONIC SHORTAGES OF MANY BASIC GOODS PEOPLE HAVE TO QUEUE FOR HOURS OUTSIDE SUPERMARKETS AND PHARMACIES AND BECAUSE OF ENERGY RATIONING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WORK FOR ONLY TWO DAYS A WEEK PRESENT MEDORO WHOSE APPROVAL RATINGS ARE EXTREMELY LOW IS RESISTING ATTEMPTS BY CONGRESS TO REMOVE HIM IN A RECALL REFERENDUM AND SAID HE WOULD DEFEND VENEZUELA'S LEFTISTS HAVE TO REVOLUTION AT ALL COSTS
THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DONALD TRUMP THE SAID IT WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMME HIS APPROACH HAS BEEN STRONGLY CRITICISED BY HILLARY CLINTON WHO LEADS THE RACE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION FROM LOS ANGELES DAVID WILLIS REPORTS
DONALD TRUMP'S STANCE ON NORTH KOREA WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY NO SERVING U.S. PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH THE LEADER OF THE ISOLATED COMMUNIST STATE RELYING INSTEAD ON DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO NEGOTIATE WITH ITS ERRATIC LEADER KIM JONG MY TRUMP SAID THAT HIS APPROACH WOULD BE DIFFERENT I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS BEGIN
AT THE SAME TIME OUTPUT A LOT OF PRESSURE AND CHINA BECAUSE ECONOMICALLY WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER OVER JANET PEOPLE DON'T REALISE JANNIC HIMSELF THERE PROBLEM WITH ONE MEETING A WONDERFUL
AN ADVISOR TO MISTER TRUMP'S MAIN DEMOCRATIC RIVAL HILLARY CLINTON CONTRASTED HIS WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR WITH HIS PREDICTION THAT RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN MIGHT BE LESS THAN HARMONIOUS AND ADDED THAT HIS APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY MADE NO SENSE MISTER TRUMP HAD EARLIER RESPONDED SHARPLY TO MISSUS CLINTON'S CRITICISM OF HIS APPROACH TO WOMEN CALLING HER HUSBAND FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON THE WORST ABUSER OF WOMEN IN U.S. POLITICAL HISTORY
THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY ELECTION IN THE U.S. STATE OF OREGON HAS BEEN WON BY BERNIE SANDERS HE SAID TO BE NECK AND NECK WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN KENTUCKY THE RESULTS WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT IN THE OVERALL RACE WITH MISSUS CLINTON MAINTAINING HER BIG LEAD DONALD TRUMP WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN OREGON ADDING ANOTHER STATE TO HIS TALLY

AS WELL AS WITH CIVIL SOCIETY AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS THE HEAD OF THE COMMITTEE IS CONSERVATIVE M.P. CRISPIN BLUNT WELL SAY YOU OUR RELATIONSHIP IS SO POOR THAT ONE IS A BOY
SEEKING OUT AREAS OF COMMON GROUND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A COMMON INTEREST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BY THAT THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG IN A RELATIONSHIP BOTH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT ALSO OVER TWO DECADES SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND EXCEED PUSH GOLF SO THE VISITING M.P.S HAVE A SHORT HIM THAT NOT ALL BRITISH LAW MAKERS ARE HOSTILE TO RUSSIA
THE NEW PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS FIVE THOUSAND TO ONE OUTSIDERS LEICESTER CITY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A RAPTUROUS RECEPTION BY THAI FANS AT BANGKOK'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT THE CLUB'S OWNED BY THE BILLIONAIRE BEHIND THAILAND'S DUTY FREE GIANT KING POWER AND A TWO DAY TOUR OF HIS HOMELAND HAS BEEN ORGANISED FOLLOWING CELEBRATIONS IN LEICESTER EARLIER THIS WEEK
IT IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT THE QUEEN MAKES A SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT TODAY THE ONE WRITTEN BY THE GOVERNMENT SPELLING OUT WHAT IT WANTS TO DO OVER THE COMING YEAR NO ONE EXPECTED TO BE TERRIBLY EXCITING IF ONLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS SOMEWHAT PREOCCUPIED BY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD IF THE NATION BOATS TO LEAVE EUROPE WE MAY END UP WITH A VERY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR THAT IS
THE CENTREPIECE OF THE SPEECH WILL BE CHANGES TO THE WAY PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE MANAGED THREE MONTHS AGO DAVID CAMERON SAID IT WOULD BE AN AGENDA FOR A REVOLUTION WELL I'M JOINED BY CHRIS GRAYLING WHO'S THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS UNTIL LAST YEAR WAS HIMSELF JUSTICE SECRETARY GOOD MORNING TO YOU HELLO THERE BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE PRISONS ARE IN A SHOCKING STATE WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED MINOR CHANGES TO THE WAY THEY'RE MANAGED HE'S TINKERING ISN'T IT
WELL NO I DON'T THINK IT IS I THINK IT'S THE LATEST STAGE IN OUR PLANS TO TRANSFORM OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN CLOCK STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH WORKING PRISONS I DID MAJOR REFORMS TO THE PROBATION SYSTEM HOW WE LOOK AFTER OFFENDERS OFF THEY LEAVE PRISON MICHAEL IS NOW TRANSFORMING THE WAY THE PRISONS WORK IT'S PART OF A DRIVE TO ENSURE
THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS WHO OFTEN END UP IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER GET SOME REAL CHANCE AND THE LEGACY OF WHAT YOU WERE DOING IS A PRISON SYSTEM THAT IS DESPERATELY OVERCROWDED THAT IS INCREDIBLY VIOLENT WAS SEEING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE CALLED OUT ON AVERAGE EVERY TWENTY MINUTES MASSIVE INCREASE IN SUICIDE IS DESPERATE OVERCROWDING
THE GOVERNORS THEMSELVES ARE AT THEIR WITS' END YOU'RE PROUD OF THAT WELL OVERCROWDING IS NOT TO RECORD HIGH LEVELS THE KEY CHALLENGE THE PRISONER SYSTEM WAS PLACED OVER THE LAST THIRTY TWO MORE PRISONERS IN JAIL NOW THAN AT THE END OF MISSUS THATCHER'S TIME IN OFFICE I SAID OVERCROWDING IN PRISONS IS NOT AT HISTORIC HIGHS THE CHALLENGE IN OUR PRISONS
HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY AROUND THE SUCCESS I'M AFRAID THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD MANY CRIMINALS HAVE HAD IN GETTING SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS AND TO PRISON FOR NOW ILLEGAL HIGHS WE'VE MADE IT ILLEGAL TO SEND THOSE INTO PRISON OFTEN BY THROWING THAT'S ALL IT IS THE BIG CHALLENGE IN OUR PRISONS THE THING THAT HAS LED TO VIOLENCE AND OUR PRISONS
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND IT'S SOMETHING I HEARD REGULARLY FROM PRISON OFFICERS AND INDEED FROM POLICE OUTSIDE OUR PRISONS THE BIG CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE WAY IN WHICH SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS HAVE GOT INTO PRISONS ON A HUGE AMOUNT OF EFFORT HAS BEEN PUT IN TO TRY AND STOP THAT AND OF COURSE I'LL HAVE JUST IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT RECESSION INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO MAKE THESE SUBSTANCES ILLEGAL BECAUSE THEY WERE SO CALLED LEGAL HIGHS THERE NOT NOW THEY ARE TO THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF COLD IN THE PRISON
AN HOUR AGO FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION HE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION LEGAL HIGHS WHAT HE DID MENTION WAS DESPERATE OVERCROWDING WELL IF YOU LISTEN IT'S ALL ENOUGH MONEY TO RUN THE PRISMS AND YOU'RE CUTTING THE MONEY IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT BOTH THE CURRENT AND THE PREVIOUS CHIEF INSPECTOR HAVE SAID THEY HAVE BOTH HIGHLIGHTED THE ISSUE OF LEGAL HIGHS IN PRISONS AND IT'S CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE NEW CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS PETER CLARKE SAYS MANY JAILS ARE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE
OF COURSE THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN TO TRANSFORM THE PRISON ESTATE BUT WE'RE BUILDING NEW PRISONS WERE PUTTING EXTENSIONS TO YOU PRISONS WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A BIG NEW PRISON IN WREXHAM WE'VE BUILT EXTENSIONS MODERN EXTENSIONS TO OLD PRISONS MICHAEL COVE IS NOW MOVING AHEAD WITH A FURTHER STAGE IN DOING THE PROGRAMME ON A PRISON TO TRY AND MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT A PRISONER STATE THAT IS FIT FOR PURPOSE AND WHAT ABOUT SENDING FEWER PEOPLE TO PRISONS THAT'S WHAT THE PRISON GOVERNORS WANT TO THAT'S WHAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WANT THAT'S WHAT KEN CLARKE WANTED AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID
WE'VE PUT THE APPROACH WE'VE TAKEN ACID GOVERNMENT IS TO SAY THAT WHERE THE COURT WANTS TO SEND SOMEONE TO PRISON THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO DO SO OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T COME BACK AND WHAT MICHAEL DOES YOUR GUYS LIMESTONE THEY FOLLOW THE GOVERNMENT'S GUIDELINES THAT'S WHAT JUDGES ARE REQUIRED TO DO WHAT MICHAEL COPE IS DOING IS WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE INTRODUCE BETTER EDUCATION IN PRISONS IN THE WAY THAT I INTRODUCED BETTER SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAVE THERE ARE BOOKS IN PRISONS
WELL THAT'S A COMPLETE MYTH THAT NEVER HAPPENED NEVER EXISTED WHAT I DO BECAUSE EVERYBODY BONKERS WHEN IT WAS SUCH A SALE WHEN IT WAS NEVER SUGGESTED IT WAS A COMPLETE MYTH GENTLEMEN WHAT WE DID IN FACT WAS TO ENSURE THAT FIFTY THOUSAND OFFENDERS WHO WALK OUT OF JAIL EACH YEAR OR DID WITH NO SUPPORT NO GUIDANCE OR ANY SALT NOW GET PROPER SUPPORT WHEN THEY LEAVE IT'S ALL PART OF OUR DRIVE THE DRIVE YOU CAN SEE IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH TODAY TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS PARTICULARLY BETTER CHANCES IN LIFE
CAN I TALK TO YOU IN YOUR CAPACITY AS ONE OF THE LEADING FIGURES IN THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN WAS BORIS JOHNSON RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE EUROPEAN WANTS US TO A SUPER STATE JUST AS HITLER NAPOLEON HITLER VARIOUS PEOPLE DID
BORIS IS A HISTORIAN HE WAS MAKING HISTORIANS COMMENT BUT THE POINT YEP THERE IS A CLEAR PLAN IN BRUSSELS AS PART OF THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE EURO TO MOVE TOWARDS MUCH GREATER POLITICAL INTEGRATION LIKE HITLER THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY TODAY WHEN YOU NO IT ISN'T WHAT WITH THE GREATEST OF RESPECT THIS SORT OF THING IS PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT DOESN'T IT IF A LEADING POLITICIAN SAYS THE EUROPEAN UNION DRAWS COMPARISONS
BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ONE OF THE GREATEST MASS MURDERERS IN OUR HISTORY THAT ISN'T SOMETHING WE PASS OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS IT CERTAINLY HIM MICHAEL HESELTINE DOESN'T THINK IT IS HE WILL HE SAYS IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS I THINK BORIS HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT MISQUOTED QUOTED BUT THE POINT IS OFTEN SAID I WONDERED IF YOU MIGHT SAY THAT
WENT TO THE TOP ARE KEPT IN THE GOOD NAPOLEON HITLER VARIOUS PEOPLE TRIED THIS OUT AND IT ENDS TRAGICALLY THE E.U. IS AN ATTEMPT TO DO THIS BY DIFFERENT METHODS IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT HITLER DID I'M ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT BORIS JOHNSON WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT AND IF YOU APPROVE OF IT WELL BUT BORIS WAS MAKING A HISTORIAN'S POINT BORIS IS A HISTORIA
I'M ISOLATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ITSELF WAS TRYING TO DO WHAT I'M TO DO SO IT CAN WE JUST CLEAR THIS UP AND THEN BY ALL MEANS LET'S MOVE ON WAS HE RIGHT TO DRAW THAT COMPARISON WAS IT RIGHT FOR HISTORIANS MAKE HISTORIANS COMMENT YOU WHETHER BORIS JOHNSON WHO WAS A POLITICIAN FIRST AND MAYBE HE HAS A SOME CRACKER RECORD AS ANY STORY AND ACADEMICALLY BUT HE IS A POLITICIAN A VERY SENIOR POLITICIAN WAS HE RIGHT TO DRAW A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND
ADOLF HITLER WAS A SAID BORIS JOHNSON WAS MAKING HISTORIANS COMMENT ABOUT HISTORY DOES THE QUESTION ASK YOU THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IT IS A VERY VERY SIMPLE QUESTION WAS HE RIGHT I KNOW WHAT HE DID YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME THAT THREE TIMES I'M ASKING YOU WHETHER HE WAS RIGHT TO DO IT
BUT BORIS WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS THE REALITY THAT THERE IS A DRIVE TOWARDS GREATER POLITICAL INTEGRATION BORIS AT MAKING A HISTORICAL ANALOGY FROM A. HISTORIAN TALKING ABOUT A WHOLE RANGE OF ACTION SINCE THE SINCE THE ROMAN EMPIRE HE'S A HISTORIAN MAKING A COMMENT IN HIS OWN WORDS MY VIEW IS THAT WE SHOULD BE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT INTEGRATION IN THERE PUT IT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE CONCERNED THAT HE TALKS ABOUT HITLER IN THIS CONTEXT THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THIS CONTEXT AS MICHAEL HESELTINE WAS
WELL LOOK I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE SEA BUT I'M BORIS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA
WHILE ALL THIS UP YES WE'RE HAVING A LIVELY DEBATE WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE NO YOU'RE HAVING ACCORDING TO MICHAEL HESELTINE WERE ALSO GETTING ON WITH GOVERNING THE COUNTRY SETTING OUT AN AGENDA TO DELIVER A BETTER SECURITY FOR ECONOMY BETTER SECURITY FOR OUR NATION AND AN AGENDA THAT IS ABOUT DRIVING LIFE CHANCES FOR PEOPLE FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS THAT'S WHAT TODAY'S ALL ABOUT YES WE'RE HAVING A LIVELY DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE BUT WE'RE ALSO GETTING ON WITH GOVERNING THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT ON MISTER HESELTINE'S WRONG WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT CIVIL WAR IN THE PARTY
WELL I WANT THE PARTY TO HAVE A PROPER DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE I WANT US THEN WHATEVER THE RESULTS TO CARRY ON WITH THE JOB OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY AND TODAY IT'S ALL ABOUT DEMONSTRATING THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THAT BUT WHILE WE HAVE A DEBATE ACROSS A NATION ABOUT EUROPE WE ARE ALSO GETTING ON WITH DELIVERING WHAT WE WERE ELECTED ON A YEAR AGO A MANIFESTO COMMITTED TO IMPROVING LIFE CHANCES OF THOSE FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS CHRIS GRAYLING MANY THANKS AND OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG AS LISTENING TO THAT WOULD HE MAKE THAT LAURA
MORNING JOHN BUT I THINK WE'VE JUST HEARD JUST HOW DIFFICULT AND SQUEAMISH THIS HAS ALL BECOME FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHRIS GRAYLING CLEARLY RELUCTANT THEY ARE TO REDRAW THE HISTORICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THE E. USE PLANS FOR FURTHER INTEGRATION AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST WHETHER WITH HITLER OR NAPOLEON IT'S BORIS JOHNSON AND VOTE THOSE HISTORICAL COMPARISONS IN AN ARTICLE LAST WEEK THIS HAS BECOME A VERY SERIOUS WAR OF WORDS INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE GOVERNING PARTY
BUSY CAMPAIGNING AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A BATTLE THAT HAS BECOME A BITTER AND PERSONAL FEELS TO ME IT'S ALREADY AT DEF CON ONE WE'VE STILL GOT MORE THAN A MONTH TO GO MEANWHILE TODAY WE WILL SEE THE QUEEN'S GOLDEN CARRIAGE THAT BEAUTIFUL SHINY BLACK HORSES THE YEOMANRY GUARD ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE OFFICIAL TITLE'S PROCESS DOWN WHITEHALL INTO PARLIAMENT SHE WILL TAKE HER SEAT IN THE HOUSE
LIST THE GOVERNMENT'S AMBITIONS AND ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THIS IS A VERY STRANGE SITUATION INDEED WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT SORT OF LOCKED IN WARFARE ON A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN THE MEANTIME MENACES ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP PLANS AND ACTUALLY CONVINCE PEOPLE THEY STILL GOT OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MINDS AND WE CAN'T BE SURE THAT AT THE END OF ALL THIS AT THE END OF THE REFERENDUM IT'LL BE THE SAME GOVERNMENT I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE PERSONNEL WHO WAS PRIME MINISTER
WELL INDEED THAT WILL BE AT THE BACK OF MANY PEOPLE'S MINDS AS THEY PROCESS INTO THE CHAMBER TODAY NO DOUBT COULD THIS BE IN THEORY DAVID CAMERON'S LAST QUEEN QUEEN'S SPEECH POSSIBLY IF INDEED THE REFERENDUM GOES THE WRONG WAY FOR A NUMBER TEN AND UNLEASHES SOME KIND OF POOCH TO TRY TO GET RID OF HIM BUT HE IS CLEAR AND THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO DO TODAY IS TO SHOW PEOPLE HE'S PUSHING ON WITH THE SECOND HALF OF HIS POLITICAL TASK THE SOCIAL REFORMS THAT HE IS INTERESTED IN
WHERE THEIR PRISON REFORM WHETHER MEASURES ON ADOPTION IS TRYING TO SHOW AFTER TWO THOUSAND TEN TO FIFTEEN WAS DOMINATED BY TRYING TO SORT OUT THE ECONOMY THERE IS NO GAS LEFT IN THE TANK IF YOU LIKE THEY STILL HAVE IDEAS THEY STILL HAVE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT IT DOES OF COURSE BLEED INTO EACH OTHER AND THAT IS WHY THERE WILL ONLY BE A PROMISE AND I OWE YOU IF YOU LIKE THAT NO DETAIL OF THE LONG PROMISED BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS THAT ARGUMENT IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY THAT IS PART OF THE E.U. DEBATE
AND TODAY TO AVOID CONTROVERSY THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE GET ANY DETAIL ABOUT IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH EVEN THOUGH FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT WESTMINSTER LAURA THANKS SO MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY PAST EIGHT SO HAROLD EVANS FORMER EDITOR OF THE SUNDAY TIMES ONCE TOLD A STORY ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER DON MCCULLEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A WARZONE AMID PEOPLE SCREAMING GUNFIRE EVERYBODY RUNNING AND DUCKING FOR COVER MCCULLEN STOPPED LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE AN EXPOSURE READING HE SAID AFTERWARDS WHAT IS THE POINT OF GETTING KILLED IF YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG EXPOSURE
HIS BODY OF WORK OVER SIX DECADES INCLUDES MANY WALLS FROM CYPRUS TO CONGO VIETNAM CAMBODIA NORTHERN IRELAND LEBANON AND OTHERS HE'S JUST BACK FROM PALMYRA IN SYRIA AND WILL BE NAMED MASTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE PHOTO LONDON FAIR WHICH BEGINS TOMORROW HE'S HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE EXTREME SITUATIONS CONFLICTS WHICH SHOW THE WORST THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN DO TO EACH OTHER THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE THERE
SADLY I DO BECAUSE I CANNOT SIT ON
THE EDGE OF MY SOFA AND WATCH NEWS BULLETINS I AN IMPULSE AND WANT TO BE THERE I WANT TO SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND I WANT TO RECORD IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY LAST VISIT TO SYRIA WAS WAS VERY MUCH ON OF BEING CHASED AROUND BY THEIR MINDERS AND PEOPLE SAYING TO ME NO NO NO ALL THE TIME EVERY DRUMMER POINT OF MY CAMERAS IN A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
WHAT DID YOU SEE IN PALMA ARE YOU DO YOU DID GET TO THE CITY EVENTUALLY GOT TO AFTER MUCH STRUGGLE WITH THE OFFICIALS AND I HAVE A GREAT PASSION ABOUT HER BECAUSE I DID A BOOK ABOUT THE ROMAN CITIES
OF NORTH AFRICA FIVE YEARS AGO SO WHEN I SAW THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE OF BELL I HAD TO GET THERE AND SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES AND SADLY WHEN I GOT THERE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND TOTAL CONTROL AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE COLONISED THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GO INTO THE TEMPLE I SAW THE
GATES OF THE TEMPLE GATES I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND I THOUGHT I'M GOING TO SNEAK IN HERE AND I COULDN'T MOVE THE GATES SAW A GREAT GAP IN THE WALL I THOUGHT I'D CLIMB OVER THERE AND I MANAGED TO TAKE ONE IMAGE OF THE DESTROYED TEMPLE WHICH WAS TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT
AND THEN SUDDENLY A RUSSIAN SOLDIER APPEARED IN FULL COMBAT AND TOLD ME TO GO AWAY WHO DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH RECORDS BUT HE POINTED HIS KALASHNIKOV AND I TOOK THIS TOOK HIS ADVICE ON IT AND I HAD TO GO AWAY BUT IT WAS TERRIBLE TO GO THAT WAY AND
THE TEMPLE ITSELF WAS A VERY THEY CLAIM THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IT TOGETHER BUT ACROSS THE STONES HAVE BEEN FRAGMENT AGED INTO A LITTLE ALMOST MARBLE SIZED PIECES HOW THEY GOING TO RE CREATE IT WON'T BE THE SAME
IT GIVES US AN IDEA JUST HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE BUT EVEN AT THAT AT YOUR STAGE HAVING ESTABLISHED A CAREER LIKE YOURS ARE SUCH STILL A HUGE AMOUNT OF CHANCE IN WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU GO TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACES IS A PART OF WHY YOU'VE YOU'VE ALMOST ADVISED AGAINST PEOPLE TODAY GOING INTO PHOTOJOURNALISM AS A CAREER
I GOT A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS TODAY IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A STAGE ANYTHING AN IMMORAL THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF OF HIS ABOUT SUCCESSFUL RICH GOOD LOOKING NARCISSISTIC KIND OF PEOPLE OF FILM FESTIVALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT NEWS REALLY I KNOW I GREW UP IN THE NEW PART OF NEWS HISTORY WERE YOU USED TO HARD NEWS AND IT WAS SO EXCITING FOR ME TO DO THAT
I USED TO EARN ON THE SUNDAY TIMES FOR TWENTY YEARS I HAD OF FREE RANGE WE MUST GET GOING AND IT WAS WONDERFUL I USED TO GO OFF AND STICK MY LIVES ON THE LINE BUT TERM AND BY THE WAY I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN PHOTOGRAPHY AS WELL I MEAN IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT ME HAVING AN AMAZING LIVES I WAS I REALLY CARED ABOUT THE THINGS I'VE HEARD OF THE SUFFERING OF THE PEOPLE I PHOTOGRAPH WHICH
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT YOU KNOW AND I'M LOOKING I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF YOUR VERY ICONIC IMAGES FROM THE VIETNAM WAR IT'S A SEA AN AMERICAN SOLDIER WAITING TO BE TRANSPORTED AWAY FROM THE FRONT LINE OF THE TET OFFENSIVE IN HE'S A SHELL SHOCKED SOLDIER LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE CAMERA WITH A BLANK EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHEN TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMEONE IN IN IN A STATE IN A POOR STATE
TASTELESS INTRUSIVE HAD HOW DO YOU WEIGH ALL OF THAT I DO IT VERY QUICKLY ACTUALLY I SEW SOMETHING MY EYES WERE THE BEST GIFT HAVE BEEN GIVEN A LIFE AND I WASN'T PARTICULARLY A VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON IN THE OLD DAYS OF SCHOOL AT FIFTEEN NO EDUCATION BUT MY EYES WERE MY GEAR SO HE DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME I WOULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOLDIER AND I WOULD I WOULD POUNCE O.K. IT SOUNDS A BIT MERCENARY I SUPPOSE BUT THAT'S MY JOB
TRAIN MY TO HAVE TO BE QUICK AND FAST AND PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT THAT PICTURE THE PROBLEM IS IT'S SLIGHTLY ICONIC LOOKING AT IS TRYING TO BE MONA LISA IN ANOTHER KIND OF SAD WAY IT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IT MEANS THAT IT'S A FIXED KIND OF IMAGE AND IT'S SOMETHING I HOPE YOU DON'T FORGET THAT
MANY PEOPLE SAY TO ME HAVE YOU EVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT MAN AND I YOU KNOW I CAN'T GO TRAVELLING LOOKING FOR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES AND TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S WELFARE WHICH MAKES ME SOME QUITE MERCENARY BUT I'M NOT
SO YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT HIS FATE WAS NO I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE SAID TO ME HE'S PROBABLY HIGHLY LIKELY HE'S LIVING IN A TRAILER PARK IN AMERICA OR SOMEWHERE IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE DON MCCULLEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

EFFORT THAT'S BEING MADE TO TO LURE PEOPLE ON THIS IS THE SORT OF STUFF BUT IS BEING SAID TO TRY TO GET YOU ON TRUMP'S SIDE AND COULTER HE OR SHE IS
HE'S UPSETTING ANNOYING DRIVING CRAZY ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN BARTY AND QUOTE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT WHOM I WANT TO UPSET ANNOY AN IRRITATED I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN ACTING FOR TWENTY YEARS LIKE THE OTHER SMART HALF OF THE TEAM KNOW THEY HAVE COMPLETELY BETRAYED THE AMERICAN VOTER COMPLETELY AMERICANS DON'T WANT IMMIGRATION THEY DON'T WANT ANY MORE WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A HEART
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HAVE A HOME YOU SEE YOU KNOW NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AND ALL THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND THEY LOVE THEIR HOME I'M GOING HOME WHERE YOU'LL BE PEOPLE I KNOW IT'S A WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE A HALL BUT YOU YOU'RE A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS IF SOMEHOW WE ARE NOT IF SOMEONE HAD SAID THAT ABOUT JEWISH IMMIGRATION INTO NEW YORK A CENTURY AGO
GOOD YOU HAVE IMPROVED DOMINANCE AGAIN THAT WITH THE TERROR THAT THAT'S TO A AS WELL IN FACT THAT'S TWO PER CENT OF THE POPULATION THAT DID NOT OVERWHELM OUR CULTURE YEAH WE TAKE IMMIGRANTS BUT WE HAVE PAWS AS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE ARE BEING OVERWHELMED YOU'VE BEEN OUT IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE YOU GOT ENABLED TO BE WARRANTS BEING NEW
SO WORK AT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN NAME IMMIGRATION NO HUNDRED PERCENT HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD TAKE TO BUILD A THIRTY FORTY FIFTY FOOT WALL ALONG TWO THOUSAND MILES OF AMERICAN TERRAIN AND IF THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR IT
WHAT THEN HAPPENS JUST TAKE US THROUGH THE PRACTICALITY WELL IF ONLY WE HAD A DEVELOPER WHO HAD BUILT ONE HUNDRED STOREY BUILDINGS WERE YOU CAN FLUSH THE TOILET AND EAT CRUMBLE AWAY ON ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH FLOOR IF ONLY WE HAD SOMEONE LIKE THAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND BY THE WAY WHO CARES OF MEXICO PAYS FOR BUT YOU BET THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT WHY SHOULD THEY
WHY SHOULD THEY BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN SANDING RAPISTS DRUG DEALERS I MEAN HIS ENTIRE ERA ONE PROBLEM WHICH IS A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW IT'S SICKENING THE NUMBER OF OF PEOPLE WERE DYING FROM OVERDOSES JUST WRECKS LIVES WRECKED COMMUNE IS WRECKED STATES THAT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THE PROBLEM OF HAVING MEXICO ON OUR BORDER IMMIGRATION IS THE ISSUE THE VOTERS HAVE BEEN DEFIED ON
FOR TWENTY YEARS I MEAN BOTH REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED TO SLIP THROUGH AMNESTY'S THREE TIMES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS WE GOT SHUT DOWN BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CALLING IN AND SHUTTING DOWN THE SWITCHBOARD HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO TELL THEM WE DON'T WANT YOUR MYSTIC THE LAST AMNESTY THAT WAS INTRODUCED AMERICA WAS BY RONALD REAGAN THIRTY SIX THAT'S RIGHT AND YET REFLECTS ON HIS LEGACY
AT LEAST HE ONLY MADE THE MISTAKE ONCE THESE ARE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO KEEP MAKING THE EXACT SAME MISTAKE HOUSE OR A BUBBLE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT GAVE ILLEGAL ALIENS INSTEAD TO A DRIVER'S LICENCE
IT'S MADNESS WITH THE MAIN POINT OF HER DRUMS DOING IT'S PUNNING ON ME COMES FIRST NOT THE RICH NOT THE WALL STREET NOT THE CORPORATIONS AND TRUMP IS THE ONLY ONE SPEAKING FOR AMERICANS ON THE BAD TRADE DEALS ON IMMIGRATION ON PUTTING AMERICA FIRST OR NOT CONTINUING TO PAY FOR NATO
DO YOU THINK IT'S A DANGEROUS WORLD OR NOT DO YOU THINK PUTIN IS BUT I CARE ABOUT KEEPING IT SAFE HERE
I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE UKRAINE ANY MORE THAN I THINK RUSSIA SHOULD CARE WHAT WE DO WITH THE ILLEGALS HERE IN TEXAS I HAVE AN IDEA GOOD LUCK TO THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT WHAT TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE
WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR SAYING ALL MUSLIMS SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THE UNITED STATES THE RATIONALE IS NINE ELEVEN FOR HOOD BOSTON MARATHON SEE AMBER LATINO COMMUNITY CENTRE OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER SAX BUT WHY NOT I HAVEN'T FINISHED I'M SO ENTERING
WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMMITTING TO ON FLYING PLANES INTO A SKY SCRAPERS ARE SHOOTING UP INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHAT OF IT WHAT GOOD ARE THEY THERE ARE NO WELFARE ARE COMMITTING SMALL PETTY CRIMES THEY ARE COMPLETE WE WERE THE GOVERNMENT EVERY PILL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EVERYONE MARIE YOU SING THAT EVERYONE

I THINK I'M NOT AS CONFIDENT ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY AND WHY IS THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF WOMEN VOTERS IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS ALREADY CHANGED THE COUNTRY ENOUGH OH AND BY THE WAY DO NOT IMAGINE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR MASS IMMIGRATION OF THE THIRD WORLD BECAUSE OF GREAT HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS POST NINETEEN SEVENTY IMMIGRANTS VOTE EIGHT TO TWO FOR THE DEMOCRATS THEY'VE CHANGED THE ELECTORATE CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE SITTING NOW
USED TO GIVE US REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS REAGAN NIXON NO REPUBLICANS GET THE LEFT STAY WIDE ANY MORE WELL THERE THEY'VE BEEN IN ANY GUARANTEES IMMIGRATION ACT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO THE QUESTION IS IS IT TOO LATE THEY HAD IT WIRED IF THEY ARE ALREADY DONE IT ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH AMERICANS VOTING IN THIS ELECTION FOR TRUMPED OIL AND IN YOUR VIEW WHAT HAPPENS IF HE LOSES IT'S OVER WE'RE GOING TO BE HOMESICK FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES COS AMERICA'S GUY

WHOA WHAT IS IT ABOUT AS YOU SAY SHE'S DONE AN AWFUL LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE YEARS WHAT WHAT WAS HER BIG APPEAL
AND ARE YOU GOING TO CARRY ON AND EASTENDERS OH YOU KNOW A DATA STREAM YOU STILL AREN'T ME RIGHT COS YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME YOURSELF HAVEN'T YOU
THANKS FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT PEGGY MITCHELL OR BARBARA WINDSOR WHICHEVER YOU LIKE THANKS A LOT
I THINK IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE HOW DO YOUNGER VOTERS SEE THE E.U. REFERENDUM THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING OUT THIS MORNING IN THE LATEST OF OUR TRAVELS AROUND THE U.K. AHEAD OF THE VOTE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD KNICKERS IN NORWICH WITH STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA MORNING
MORNING MICHELLE THE COFFEE THE CONVERSATION IS STILL FLOWING HERE AT THE STUDENT UNION IT THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW IN THIS E.U. REFERENDUM THE YOUNGER YOU ARE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO VOTE TO REMAIN
BUT THE YOUNGER YOU ARE THE LESS LIKELY YOU ARE TO VOTE AT ALL AND FINALLY THE MORE THE ECONOMY IS YOUR PRINCIPAL CONCERN THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THAT'S WHAT THE POLLS SHOW ALONGSIDE THAT HUBBUB YOU CAN HEAR IN THE BACKGROUND OF STUDENTS HAVING A COFFEE
ACROSS AND I'M JOINED BY FORMER FORMER THREE FORMER STUDENTS NOW ALL YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESSES HERE IN NORWICH IS IN NORWICH I'M SORRY
MATT LEAGUE AND HE'S HERE KELSI VINYL I'M KATE BATTY AND EACH IN TURN ARE GOING TO TELL US WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THAT SHAPES WHAT THEY THINK
I AM ALL WE ARE A OF ATOCHA MANUFACTURE THEY SUET IN NORWICH
SO FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THIS IS A REALLY KEY QUESTION DO WE STAY DO WE GO
I'M ON THE FENCE HERE SO FOR MY PUT FOR PERSONALLY FOR THE BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT SHOULD WHICH ESTATE
FOR PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW WE SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE BECAUSE I THINK AS A COUNTRY WE'VE GIVEN AWAY A SEVENTY WE NEED SOME POWER WAS BACK INTO THE U.K. BUT IS A SMALL CHOCOLATE FIRM HERE IN NORWICH DOES BRUSSELS GET YOUR GOATS DOES IT ANNOY YOU YES IT DOES IN A NOISE AS IT FRUSTRATES AS WE ARE HEAVILY REGULATED THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF RED TAPE
AND SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW YES ABSOLUTELY AND NOW KELSEY YOUR FIRM DOES WHAT WOULD IT MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE TO YOU WHETHER WE STAY IN OR GET OUT AND WE HAVE A RECRUITMENT COMPANY THAT SPECIALISES IN HEAD HUNTING
CAN WE ALSO HAVE A TRAINING COMPANY THAT PROVIDES TRAINING IN SERVICES FOR A RANGE OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES SO FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN THE E.U. JUST BECAUSE WHEN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S CHANGE PEOPLE COME CAUTIOUS BUSINESS MAY THEREFORE SLOW DOWN AND THAT WILL IMPACT US SUPPLYING SERVICES TO THE OTHER BUSINESSES AND THE GREAT DEBATE ABOUT FREE MOVEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT ONE THAT AFFECTS YOU AS SOMEONE TO RECRUIT
OF COURSE IF WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE A HIGH TALENT HOLLY TALENTED INDIVIDUALS IF THERE'S LESS PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM THEN OF COURSE IT'S GONNA BE MORE DIFFICULT SO YES FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE TO US KATE YOU'RE LISTENING CAREFULLY TO BOTH SIZE
AND YET TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND I AM I SO MY COMPANY'S GOOD CATERING WE DO FITNESS PARTIES AND EVENTS AND WE SPECIALISED IN FOCUSING THEIR CHILDREN AND SCHOOLS AND I
I JUST FEEL THAT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I GET IS VERY BIASED AND HE'S HE'S VERY HARD TO MAKE A CLEAR CUT DECISION
WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY ON THOUGH WHEN YOU HEAR MATT WHO'S BASICALLY SAYING SOVEREIGNTY THAT'S THE KEY THING YOU HEAR KELSEY SINGLE AT THEIR ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES IN CONTINUING TO HAVE THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS
DO YOU INCLINE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I'M FOR SIDE BY BOTH HANDS JUST KEEP FLITTING BETWEEN SO YOU REALLY ARE STILL MAKE LET'S BRING IN SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE HERE AND SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE VIEWS THAT WOULD AFFECT THIS
HERE IN THESE ARGUMENTS LET'S START OVER HERE FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU SO I MEAN WHAT I'M HEARING A LOT ABOUT IS THE SORT OF ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS BUT YOU KNOW I WAS A STUDENT WE COPE WE CARE ABOUT MUCH WIDER ISSUES WE CARE ABOUT THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE WE CARE ABOUT
THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE CARE ABOUT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS HAPPENING IN CALAIS AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT MORE IF YOU CUT HAVE ONE ARE YOU POINT WE'RE INHERITING THE PROVINCE OF THE FUTURE AND THERE'S A GUY HERE WITH HER
FOR ME THE N.H.S. ARGUMENT IS ONE IMPORTANT ONE SO AS AN N.H.S. WORKER THE PROTECTS MY RIGHTS TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS' WORK MAXIMUM DURING THE WEEK IT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF MY PATIENTS TEAM
FREE AND SAFE HEALTH CARE BUT IT ALSO PROTECTS THEIR SAFETY THROUGH ENSURING THAT THERE'S A SUSTAINABLE WORKFORCE TO REMAIN IT'S BEHIND YOU
I AS AN IRISH PERSON WHO IS THE U.K. I WOULD WORRY ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR A PART WILL HAVE TO APPLY FOR A VISA FOR THE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
SO THAT EVERY MOVEMENT BORN AGAIN LET ME BRING IN SOMEBODY JUST THERE BEHIND YOU I THINK YOU'RE IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING
SO I'VE RECENTLY DECIDED TO VOTE LEAVE BECAUSE I THINK THE E.U. IS FUNDAMENTALLY RIGHT WING I THINK IT'S UNACCOUNTABLE AND THEREFORE UNFILMABLE YOU THINK IT'S A PRO BIG BUSINESS ORGANISATION
YOU'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS AND YET AND YOU'RE PRE CLEARLY PRETTY FREE MARKET KINDA GUY
SHOULDN'T YOU BE SAYING OF COURSE THE E.U. IS PRO FREE MARKET IT IS FOR PRO THE VERY THINGS I'M IN FAVOUR FOR OUR POINT OF VIEW WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR BUSINESS IS EXPORTED TO EUROPE
SO FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW YES WE SHOULD BE SAYING YES OF COURSE FREE TRADE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FANTASTIC
FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW JEANS WITH A PERSONAL ELEMENT AS WELL IS EUROPE REALLY GOING TO PORT TRADE BARRIERS IN PLACE
I CAN'T SEE IT I JUST CANNOT SEE THAT WE ARE THE FIFTH
BIGGEST ECONOMY OR BOTH ITS ECONOMY IN THE WORLD SO A WHY ARE THEY GOING TO SHOOT MYSELF IN THE ROOF IT'S KELSEY WHEN YOU TRY AND IMAGINE WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE ON THE DAY AFTER A VOTE TO LEAVE IT
WHAT'S THE FEAR WHAT'S THE WORRY I THINK PEOPLE BE CAUTIOUS GONNA TAKE A WHILE FOR THE CHANGES TO TAKE AFFECT PEOPLE GONNA BE CAUTIOUS FOR MONTHS OFF TOWARDS AND THEREFORE THINGS WOULD SLOW UP IN TERMS OF BUSINESS
AND IN TERMS OF YOU KATE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR MIND UP YOU WEIGHING UP IN THE END FEARS ANXIETIES ABOUT WHAT
I DO THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE FROM THE U.K. AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO OBVIOUSLY WITH PEOPLE WE'RE MAKING OUR MIND UP FOR OURSELVES HERE BUT WHAT
WE'RE WE'RE AFFECTING PEOPLE IF WE WERE BORN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT COS WE'RE SO FORTUNATE HERE TO THE POINT THAT WAS BEING MADE JUST BEHIND YOU THAT THERE ARE OTHER VALUES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MATTER THAN OUR OWN SELFISH INTERESTS AS WELL
YOU SOUND TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY MAY WELL IN THE END VOTE TO REMAIN JIMMY MARSEILLE HOW'D YOU LEARN TODAY HOW MUCH ARE YOU TRYING TO LEARN AND PICK UP FROM LET'S JUST TAKE A WIDER VIEW OF THE GROUP
YOU'RE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF NOT CLAIMING YOU ARE BUT SHOUT OUT IF YOU THINK NOT HOW YOU'LL VOTE HOW DO YOU THINK THE COUNTRY WILL VOTE DO YOU THINK THE COUNTRY WILL VOTE TO REMAIN SO WHO THINKS THE COUNTRY'S LIKE VIKING TO VOTE FOR TO LEAVE
NOT SURE GUY WHO'S ABOUT TO LEAVE THEIR WELL MOST PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION SEEM TO THINK IT WILL AND IF MATT IT GOES AGAINST YOUR VIEW IF THESE GUYS ARE ALL RIGHT AND PEOPLE DO VOTE TO REMAIN
DO YOU DESPAIR WHAT DOES LIFE JUST GO ON HAVING LIFE JUST GOES ON WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE REMIT OF WHAT WE'RE GIVEN AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET SOME POWERS BACK ATTENDS A COUNTRY BRITAIN WAS WAS ONCE GREATS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN REALLY GET THAT IN HER BACK AGAIN
I THINK THE END TODAY EUROPE IS NOT A BAD THING
AND A GREAT THING BUT WE JUST NEED TO SEE SOME CHANGE WITHIN THAT AND FROM BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS
O.K. MATT KELSEY KATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL TO PEOPLE HERE AT U.E.A. THESE OF COURSE ARE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO TURN UP EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR RADIO FOUR TO TALK ABOUT A REFERENDUM THE REAL ARGUMENT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE IS WHERE THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOU HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN POLITICS CAN BE BOTHERED TO TURN UP ON JUNE THE TWENTY
NICK IT IS TENDER AND I NOW THEY'RE UNVEILING A PLAQUE TO DATE OF THE GREAT COOKERY WRITER ELIZABETH DAVID PERHAPS THE GREATEST CERTAINLY THE FIRST TO GET ONE OF THE BLUE PLAQUES AND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS SINCE THEY'VE BEEN HANDING THEM OUT HERE'S A LITTLE REMINDER OF HOW THINGS WERE IN THE KITCHENS OF ENGLAND HER BEFORE SHE HIT THE SEA
BRITISH PARFAIT CLIP FROM THE SAVOY HOTEL NO LESS AND I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY JILL NORMAN WHO WAS A LITTLE ELIZABETH DAVID'S EDITOR AND FRIEND IN LITERARY TRUSTEE AND ALSO BUYS SIMON HOPKINSON HIMSELF A GREAT CHEF AND FOOD LIKE IN FACT I THINK HE WROTE
FAVOURITE COOKBOOK MYSELF AND OTHER STORIES THERE'S A TRIBUTE NOW JILL NORMAN THE INFLUENCE THAT SHE HAD ON COOKING REALLY WAS
IMMENSE WASN'T I THINK IT WAS IT WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT HAD BY ANYONE BEFORE HER AND TO SOME EXTENT IT STILL GOES ON EVEN THOUGH SHE DIED TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO AND IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WROTE WITH ELEGANCE AND STYLE AND SHE PUT FOOD IN CONTEXT DOORWAYS IT WAS NOT JUST A HEAP OF RECIPES ONE OTHER CONTEXT IN WHAT SENSE
CULTURAL HISTORICAL LITERARY SOMETIMES AND SAY THAT YOU WILL YOU CAME ENTRUSTED YOU BECAME INTERESTED IN THE FOOD EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T GOING TO COOK IT AND I THINK THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING HELPED IMMENSELY
THAT IS INTERESTING ISN'T IT SIMON BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A CHEF YOU ARE CONCERNED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD BUT YOU ALSO A WRITER WHAT SILLY QUESTION AWAY BUT WHAT COMES FIRST FOR YOU THE WRITING ALL THE COOKING ALWAYS ALTHOUGH I I
I UM STOPPED ACTUALLY LEFT THE STOVE AT BIBENDUM IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TO CONCEDE CONCENTRATE MORE ON WRITING BUT I REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE RESTAURANT BUT WHO OR WHAT I SEE ABOUT HER WRITING IS SHE MATE SHE MADE YOU
WANT TO COOK RATHER THAN HAVE TO COOK YOUR DRINKS IT WAS IT WAS NOT AT ALL IS IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED INTERESTED IN YOUR TOMMY AND LOVELY FLAVOURS AND ALSO UM
THE WAY SHE WROTE ABOUT WHERE THE RECIPES KENT OR WHETHER IT'S DESOLATE FRANCE OR THE MEDITERRANEAN AND GENERAL RIGHT MASEN MADE YOU WANT
TO EAT IT AND ALSO AS YOU WERE SAYING TO COOK IT AND JILL THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT WEAVES OVER THE YEARS SINCE SHE DIED IN MANY MANY YEARS REALLY THAT BUT WE HAVE TAKEN TO COOKING
WE CERTAINLY HAVE YES AND I THINK SHE LED THE WAY THAT MADE SOME MADE DISCUSSION OF FOOD SOMETHING ACCEPTABLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IT USED NOT TO BE
I WHAT SHE'D HAVE MADE OF THE GREAT BAKE OFF A BOOK BRIDGE PICK UP OR WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED I THINK SHE SHE WOULD NOT BE IN FAVOUR OF COOKING AS COMPETITION NO I AGREE SHE REALLY WOULD NOT WHY BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DO OUR PART TO FEED YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIENDS BUT AND YOUR FAMILY BUT IT'S ALSO A PLEASURE BUT IT'S NOT A COMPETITIVE SPORT
I LOVE LOVE YES YES SHE SAID OFF OF THE CRAFT YOU SAID THAT YOU KNOW MAKING GOOD FOOD IS NEVER STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE IT TAKES TIME BUT IT'S BASICALLY A LABOUR OF LOVE YES
DID YOU YOU AGREED THERE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED THE COMPETITION NO I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT THE SAME I FIND IT YOU DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW IF I DO I'M QUITE QUITE DISTRESSING ACTUALLY SO YOU DON'T WATCH THE AND I SAY I SOMETIMES THINK IN FACT THAT THAT IT'S IT'S WHO'S GOING TO LOSE AS MUCH AS WHO'S GOING TO WIN THIS HONESTLY YEAH
NO BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THE SOMETHING TRIBAL ABOUT NOT NO WONDER PERHAPS THE WRONG WORD OR SOMETHING WELL IS IT IT IS COMPETITION AND IT'S IT SHOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE IN
NICE COOKING BUT WE COMPETE IN ALMOST ALL WALKS OF LIFE DON'T WE ARE VERY VERY MANY WALKS OF LIFE ANYWAY YES THERE'S A BUT BUT BUT SOMEHOW I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S BOTH OUR LOVES BUT THE BATHROOM I JUST FIND IT ODD
I'VE NEVER LIKED IT ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE THIS IS GOING TO SOUND A BIT OF A COMPETITOR QUESTION AWAY NOW WHAT WHAT MAKES
AND YOU'LL ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE I SUSPECT BUT WHAT MAKES A GREAT DISH IS THAT IS IT CAN WE SIMPLIFY IT
FLAVOUR THE QUALITY OF THE INGREDIENTS AT THE THE CARE WITH WHICH IT IS COOKED ISN'T THAT JUST A GOOD DISH I'M TRYING TO GO A BIT BEYOND THAT IS IT I MEAN OF COURSE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD NOT UP FOR A SECOND
WELL ELIZABETH WOULD HAVE ARGUED THAT A GREAT DISH CAN SOMETIMES BE THE SIMPLEST THING THERE IS SOME IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS COST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY OR HE'S BEEN VERY VERY COMPLEX TO MAKE I'D PARTICULARLY REMEMBER HER READING HOW SHE DESCRIBED EDITION OF WHICH IS
