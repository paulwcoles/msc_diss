THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE CONTEST TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAS COME UNDER A STRONG ATTACK FROM HIS CLOSEST RIVALS ON THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE SENATORS MARCO RUBIO AND TED CREWS TRIED TO USE THE EVENT TO REDUCE MY TRUMPS LEAD IN THE POLLS BEFORE ELEVEN STATES VOTE ON TUESDAY DURING HEATED EXCHANGES THEY QUESTIONED MISTER TRUMP'S POSITION ON IMMIGRATION AND HIS CHARACTER ACCUSING HIM OF LYING
IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX IT'S TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST CHRIS FALTERS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE HELLO CHRIS I SARAH THANKS A LOT FOR MOST OF THE U.K. TODAY'S GOING TO BE QUITE A QUIET DAY WEATHERWISE ALTHOUGH NOT AS MUCH SUNSHINE AS WE HAVE ENJOYED OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS FOR MOST OF US ACTUALLY TODAY IS GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE A PRETTY CLOUDY DAY AND THERE WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND THESE MAINLY AFFECTING WESTERN AREAS SO LET'S START OFF WITH THE FORECAST DETAIL ACROSS WALES
AND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND WHERE IT'S A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY AND A FEW SHOWERS RUNNING IN ACROSS DORSET STILL SWING INTO PARTS OF SOUTH WEST ENGLAND AND PARTS OF SOUTH WALES AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE DAY TODAY THE MAJORITY OF THE SHOWERS WILL BE LIGHT'S FALLING AS RAIN I CAN'T COMPLETELY RULE OUT AN ODD FLAKE OF SNOW UP OVER THE HIGHEST HILLS BUT FOR MOST IT IS RAIN POSSIBLY SOME RAIN IN THE FORECAST TO FURTHER FAR WEST OF CORNWALL BUT BETWEEN THESE THERE IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF DRY WEATHER STAYING CLOUDY WITH HIGHS OF EIGHT DEGREES
ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND ALL OF NORTHERN ENGLAND IT'S A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY FOR MOST AREAS FROST FREE FOR MANY ALTHOUGH TOWARDS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND RURAL AREAS OF DIP DOWN TO MINUS TWO SIR IS A FROST HERE TO START OFF THROUGH THE DAY AS A SAY STAY MAINLY DRY THERE WILL BE OCCASIONAL BRIGHT SWELLS GETTING THROUGH THIS LAYER OF CLOUD COULD BE AN ODD ISOLATED SHOWER FOR THE WEST MIDLANDS BUT OTHERWISE I THINK STAYING FINE TEMPERATURES BETWEEN FIVE AND EIGHT DEGREES
IN NORTHERN IRELAND NOW I THINK WE WILL SEE ONE OR TWO ISOLATED SHOWERS RUNNING INTO ANTRIM AND DOWN BUT I THINK FOR MOST OF THE DAY IT'S GOING TO STAY CLOUDY IN DRY AN AREA OF RAIN SHOULD STAY ACROSS THE BORDER IN ISLAND TEMPERATURES SIX DEGREES TODAY IN SCOTLAND WELL IT'S A FINE START FOR MANY AREAS A LOT OF CLOUD AROUND BUT THERE WILL BE SOME BRIGHT OR HAZY SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH NOT AS MANY SHOWERS AS WE HAVE SEEN OVER RECENT DAYS TEMPERATURES STILL BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE DEGREES THAT'S LATEST
THANKS CHRIS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGES OF QUITE A FEW OF THEM HAVE THE PICTURE OF TONY BLACKBURN THE FIRST D.J. TO BROADCAST ON B.B.C. RADIO ONE LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN NOW AS THE GUARDIAN PUTS IT THREATENING TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE CORPORATION CLAIMING HE'S BEEN MADE A SCAPEGOAT
ITS FAILINGS THE DAILY MIRROR SECRET BEAD MEMOS THAT GOT D.J. TONY BLACKBURN THE SAT THE MIRROR'S OBTAINED IT SAYS SECRET DOCUMENTS WHICH LED TO THE BCD SACKING MISTER BLACKBURN THERE HAVE BEEN HE WAS INTERVIEWED OVER CLAIMS HE SEDUCED A GIRL WHO LATER KILLED HERSELF THAT CONTRADICTS HIS EVIDENCE TO THE ABUSE INQUIRIES AND JANET'S ENQUIRY IN WHICH HE DENIED
BOTH THE CLAIMS AND THAT HE WAS EVER ASKED ABOUT THEM NO SUGGESTION THAT HE ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING WRONG BUT THE SUGGESTION IS THAT ACTUALLY THE MEETING THAT HE DOESN'T REMEMBER HAVING WITH B.B.C. MANAGERS DID TAKE PLACE THAT AT LEAST IS THE CLAIM THAT IS IN THE MIRROR TODAY
THESE SUN AND THE DAILY MAIL PICK UP ON THE MIGRATION FIGURES YESTERDAY NOT ONLY THE OFFICIAL STATS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND E.U. NATIONALS ARRIVED IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR BUT ANOTHER FIGURE THAT EMERGED
WHICH IS THAT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND E.U. NATIONALS REGISTERED TO WORK HE GOT A NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHICH IS WHY THE SUN'S HEADLINE IS THE GREAT MIGRANT CON AS THEY'RE QUESTIONING HOW THE TWO CAN
THAT HAVE HOW YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT DIFFERENCE IN FIGURES IT COMES FROM JONATHAN THE ECONOMIST OF THE PORTERS WHO'S BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND IT'S ALSO THE MARE PICKS UP ON IT AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE LOOKING AT IN THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING THE TIMES ON ITS FRONT PAGE THERE'S A PRIVATE EDUCATION PUTS PEOPLE'S TWO YEARS AHEAD OF STATE SCHOOL CHILDREN BY THE TIME THEY'RE SIXTEEN THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY OF ITS KIND ACCORDING TO THE PAPER IT'S BY RESEARCHERS AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY THE PRIVATE SCHOOL EFFECT THEY SAY WERE SEEN IN EVERY SUBJECT BUT IT VARIED IN SCALE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE WAS IN
FRENCH HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY THE SMALLEST IN CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS
IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX IF HE HADN'T INHERITED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW WHERE DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE RIGHT NOW SELLING WATCHES IN MANHATTAN WITH THAT LINE FINALLY VERY LATE IN THE DAY THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR MARKER RUBY AT THE GREAT HOPE OF THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT WENT AFTER THE DONALD DURING YET ANOTHER T. V. DEBATE GARY DONAHUE A WASHING CORRESPONDENT WAS WATCHING IT ALL AND GARY DO YOU THINK IT HAD ANY EFFECT
IT WAS A CERTAINLY A MUCH MORE ROBUST AND EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST HE'S HAD SOMETHING OF A A GLASS JAW UP TILL NOW MARCO RUBIO HE'S NOT REALLY IMPRESSED
A TERRIBLE DEBATE PERFORMANCE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE'S NOT WON A CONTEST UP TILL NOW BEAR IN MIND AND OF COURSE WE'VE GOT SUPER TUESDAY NEXT WEEK WITH A DOZEN STATES ARE SO GETTING A CHANCE TO VOTE SO HE HAD TO COME OUT SWINGING ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES JUSTIN HE WENT AFTER WAS THE IMMIGRATION POINT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD A WALL
MARCO RUBIO'S QUESTIONED THE VALIDITY OF SOME PARTS OF HIS IMMIGRATION PLAN PARTICULARLY THE IDEA THAT HE'D LET PEOPLE COME BACK INTO THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS THIS IS HIM TALKING ABOUT AN ACCUSATION THERE BE FLUNG AT DONALD FROM THIS EVENING BUT HE DID EMPLOYED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR TAX AS A HUGE ISSUE FOR THE COUNTRY BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CLAIM IT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT LIFTED THE SAINT OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON ON THE STAGE THAT'S EVER BEEN FINED FOR HIRING PEOPLE TO WORK ON YOUR PROJECTS ILLEGAL YOU HIRED SOME BUT NO FROM HELL THEY WANT TO STAGE A HIRED PEOPLE YOU HAVE HAVEN'T
THAT WAS RUBY OH TRUMP ANY OTHER CLASHES AND TED CREWS ALSO TRYING TO GET IN ON THE ACT HE WARMED UP MUCH LATER ON DONALD TRUMP CALLED HIM UP BASKET CASE CALLED HIM A LIAR OTHER
AND THIS IS DONALD TRUMP TELLING TED CREWS REALLY SORT OF PLAYGROUND TERMS WHAT HE THINKS OF IT
I'VE HAD AN AMAZING RELATIONSHIP WITH CARLA TITIAN'S WELL DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN BECAUSE I WAS A BUSINESSMAN I GOT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY YOU GET ALONG WITH NOBODY YOU DON'T HAVE ONE REPUBLIC
HAVE ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND YOU WORK WITH THEM EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE I WILL IF YOU WANT TO BE LIKED IN WASHINGTON THAT'S NOT A GOOD ATTRIBUTE FOR A PRESS
HAS ANYTHING CHANGED THEN GARY WELL I THINK I MEAN THE DYNAMICS ARE EXTRAORDINARY IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE FLORIDA WHICH WILL VOTE IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH DONALD TRUMP'S LEADING THEIR MARCO RUBY OR CAN'T WHEN HE'S HOME STATE THEN HE'S GOT A REAL PROBLEM
TEXAS HERE NEXT TUESDAY TAKE CRUISES SPENDING FOUR DAYS BETWEEN THE NEVADA CAUCUS FOR THE SIX DON'T IN NEVADA AND TEXT IN HIS HOME STATE A SIGN THAT EVEN HE'S WORRIED DESPITE THE FACT HE'S
DONALD TRUMP COULD LOCK THIS THING UP BY MARCH THE FIFTEENTH ON THE DELICATE CAMP AND THEN YOU'RE INTO QUESTIONS OF BROKERED CONVENTIONS OF WHETHER THEY CAN UNPICK THE NOMINATION OR LATE SAID HE REALLY IS BECOMING INSURMOUNTABLE EYE THING
CARRIED ON TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX WAS WORTH SAYING THAT THE WAY THE REPUBLICAN RACE THE ELECTION HAS PROGRESSED AS CAUGHT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE STATISTICIAN MATE SILVER BACK AND LAST AUGUST SAID TRUMP IS OVER PERFORMING AMONG LOW INFORMATION VOTERS AND HE SAID THAT BY LAST NOVEMBER THEIR RANKS WILL DECREASE TRUMPS CAMPAIGN WILL FAIL BY ONE MEANS OR ANOTHER THE WEEK'S DAMON LINK HER TWO YEARS AGO SAID JEB BUSH WILL BE THE G.O.P. GRAND A PARTY'S NOMINEE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE
IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WHO SAID I ONE MAN IN MY VIEW IS LOOKING LIKE A BIG DEAL IN THE BATTLE TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE'S IN THE WORDS OF JUSTIN WEBB AND THERE'S ONE MAN READY PINS WAS SENATOR RAND WHO'S HEY JUSTIN MY DEAR WELL I'M IN THE SAME COMPANY AS MATES
YEAH I SUPPOSE THAT'S NOT BAD THANK YOU FOR ELLA AND YOU DID ACTUALLY POINT OUT THEY GOT IT WRONG BEFORE ANYWAY TO BE OBAMA BUSINESS WERE AND TALKING OF WHICH LET'S MOVE ON WE'RE HERE LET'S MOVE ON BECAUSE SIMON'S HERE WITH STORIES OF THE BRITAIN'S BIG BUSINESSES MAKING THEIR VOICES ARE NOT JUST HERE IT'S HIS LAST DAY ISN'T IT IT IS
THE LAST TIME SIMON'S GOING TO BE HERE WITH SOME SORT OF A FANFARE WELL MANY LATER IN THIS GUYS IT'S THE LAST TIME GO OUT THAT'S TRUE ANYWAY SHALL I GET ON WITH IT THE U.K.'S BIG BUSINESSES AS YOU WERE SAYING SARAH HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD OVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS BUT WHAT ABOUT A SMALLER FIRMS THE BOSSES AS I SAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL OF ON THE BIG FIRMS MANY OF THE BIG BUSINESSES MANY BUT NOT ALL HAVE BEEN SAYING SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES
IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT CLEAR BUT THE RISKS AND THE COSTS ARE QUITE WRITTEN AND SO WE'RE A WORSE OFF WITH BRITAIN LEAVING Y. YOU'RE ALL OF US AND IF BRITAIN IS WE WOULD BE GOING THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS RENEGOTIATION OF TREATIES WITH TWENTY FIVE COUNTRIES PLUS ALL THOSE REGIONS IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE E.U. ADDING UNCERTAINTY MEANS LESS INVESTMENT LESS INVESTMENT MEANS LESS JOBS
NOW AS I SAY THAT'S BIG BUSINESS THAT WAS ANNA BUT IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF SUNTAN DER GROUP AND MORE FROM HER LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME BUT
NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL BUSINESSES ARE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED FIRMS AND ACCORDING TO THE FEDERATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT FEEL THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE LINE WE'VE GOT MURRAY BOSS OWNER OF A EIGHTY P. A SUPPLY OF QUAD BIKES AND AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY IN WORCESTER I ALSO GOT ANDREW MCRAE OWNER OF MUSEUM CONTACTS A HOME AND GIFTWARE RETAILER
BASED IN EDINBURGH AND HERE IN THE STUDIO I'VE GOT MIGHT CHERRY THE FEROCIOUS SMALL BUSINESSES POLICY CHAIRMAN SO WELCOME ALL TO YOU MURRAY FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE NOT A FAN OF THE E. YOU TOMMY WHY NOW GOOD MORNING
YOU KNOW I'M ONLY A SMALL BUSINESS AND WE EMPLOY SEVEN PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IS BASE WITHIN THE FARMING INDUSTRY AND I FEEL THAT THE FAR MINISTRIES INDUSTRY'S BEEN PUT DOWN BY EUROPE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES AND YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE MOST EFFICIENT FARMERS
PROBABLY IN THE WORLD BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT CAPABLE OF PRODUCING ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE M. TWENTY FIVE LET ALONE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ISN'T IT TRUE THOUGH THAT IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION A LOT OF THOSE SUBSIDIES UNDER THERE COME AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY THAT GO TO FARM US WOULD BE LOST IN THAT TIME OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY FOR FARMERS WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS YEAH THAT'S QUITE TRUE BUT I THINK
AREN'T WE PAYING SORT OF TEN BILLION POUNDS IN THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING BACK SO I THINK THE EUROPE PAYS A SORT OF THREE AND A HALF BILLION SO CAN'T WE SUPPORT HER OWN FARMERS
O.K. WELL LET'S TALK TO ANGIE MCCRAE YOU'RE LEANING IN WHY IS THAT A GOOD MORNING I THINK LIKE MANY BUSINESSES AND IN MY POSITION WE WE FEEL
THE DECISION TO REMAIN AT THE MOMENT IS CERTAINLY ONE WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE RISK TO US AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF AN EXIT I CERTAINLY HAVE A MAJOR CONCERN AND I THINK AS YOU MENTION THE F.S.B.
SURVEY THEY CONDUCTED REALLY I FELT VERY MUCH ALONG THOSE LINES THAT WHILST I'M INCLINED TO SAY WE SHOULD REMAIN I COULD I COULD BE SWEET TOO
TO GO THE OTHER WAY BUT IT CERTAINLY NEEDS SO MUCH CLEARER INFORMATION AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT THE BUSINESSES WILL FACE O.K. WE MIGHT CHERRY THE POLICY CHAIRMAN AT THE F.S.B. IS HERE WILL YOU DID THIS POLLING SORT OF THE NIGHT OF THE DAY ALL THE WEEKEND AFTER DAVID CAMERON DELIVERED HIS DEAL WHAT WERE THE MAJOR FINDINGS
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS HIGHLIGHT ALL RESULTS FROM THE MAIN SURVEY THAT WE DID LAST AUTUMN AND THAT IS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES THAT YOU WANT CLARITY ON WHAT THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF STAYING IN OR LEAVING THE E.U. WILL HELP ON THEIR BUSINESS AND DID YOU FIND THERE WAS MORE CLARITY IT'S A POST TO DEAL AND DAVID CAMERON'S NEGOTIATION THAN THERE WAS LAST AUTUMN OR OGILBY OFF DOES IT NO THIS IS THE FASCINATING THING LAST AUTUMN ARE MEMBERS WERE VERY SPLIT AS YOU'VE SEEN FROM BOTH MARIE AND ANDREW
YOU HAD ELEVEN PERCENT WHO WERE VERY UNDECIDED AT THAT POINT NOW YOU'VE GOT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE VERY UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW THEY WILL VOTE WHETHER IT'S REMAINING IN OR WHETHER IT'S LEAVING THERE'S A LOT MORE FACTS THAT MEMBERS WANT ROUND THE COST OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP ECONOMIC IMPACT TRADE WITH THE E.U. COMPANIES AND TRADE WITH NON E.U. COUNTRIES A COURSE WHERE WE HAD TO COME OUT
MURRAY IS IT THE FACT THAT IT IS IT JUST ONE HUNCHES IS AN IDEOLOGICAL VIEW THAT YOU HAVE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE IN EUROPE OR DO YOU ACTUALLY RUN INTO PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH RULES REGULATIONS SUCH A WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU EAT EXPERIENCE WHAT OR Y. YOU EXPERIENCE LIKE WELL DALEY I MEAN SOME OF THE TWO MORE MAJOR SUPPLIERS OF SORT OF SWITCHED THEIR MANAGEMENT FROM U.K. BASE TO EUROPEAN BASED AND SINCE THAT HAPPEN WE'VE WELL I THINK THE WHEEL'S FALLEN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BACON YOU'VE JUST GOT A BIT OF IT IS IT WOULD YOU HAVE THE MORE FILL FORMS TO FILL IN THE EXTRA COST ONE NOT SO MUCH FILL IN FORMS AND WE WORK AN HOUR BEHIND SO THEY'RE AN HOUR IN FRONT AND THEY GO HOME AN HOUR BEFORE US SO WE'VE GOT CUT OFF DEADLINES THAT HAVE BEEN DECREASED BY AN HOUR WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF TWENTY MILES ACROSS THERE ACROSS A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AND WE FIND IT
EVER SO DIFFICULT TO GET THE PARTS THAT WE USED TO BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING WOULD CHANGE IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IN THAT SITUATION THEY'D STILL BE ANSWERING THE PHONE AT THE SAME TIME AND STILL BE TWENTY MILES ACROSS WE COULD GO BACK TO U.K. MANAGEMENT AGAIN
THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY WORK BETTER AS IT DID IN THE PAST AND ANDREW HE YOU SAY THAT YOU COULD BE SWAYED TO GO OUT I MEAN WHAT WHAT OTHER ARGUMENTS WHERE THE FAULT LINES HERE WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE PERSUADED ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
I THINK FOR FOR OUR BUSINESS WE
BECAUSE WERE RETAILERS I SUPPOSE FACE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES TO TOMORROW'S BUSINESS AND THE DEED TO THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION IS PROBABLY LESS APPARENT BUT WE
WE WE HAVE A MAJOR SUPPLIER BASED IN HOLLAND AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND WE IMPORT A LOT OF PRODUCT FROM WHICH WE THEN SELL TO CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. AND THEN WE ALSO SELL BACK TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE LIVING IN THE EAST SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE THAT RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE AN IMPACT ON THAT
AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE REALITY AS A FINANCIAL IMPLICATION O. K. AND A FINAL I'M FROM YOU MIKE THE F.S.B. IS NOT TAKING YOUR LINE ON THE REFERENDUM EITHER WAY WHY NOT THE F.S.B. DOESN'T TAKE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION DUTIES AND THEY POLITICAL ORGANISATION WE VERY CLEARLY AS A SURVEYED OUR MEMBERS LAST AUTUMN THEY WERE ALMOST EQUALLY SPLIT BUT WHAT CLEARLY COMES THROUGH IS THEY WANT THAT INDEPENDENT
INFORMATION ON THE FACTS ON WHAT IT WILL ACTUALLY MEAN SHOULD WE REMAIN IN OR SHOULD WE LEAVE ALL RIGHT MIGHT CHERRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ANDREW MCRAE AND MURRAY BOSSED THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING RICHARD JEFFREY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS HERE'S OUR MARKETS GUEST WE'VE GOT A B'S RESULTS DAY AND WE ARE EXPECTING AN EIGHTH ANNUAL LOSS IN A ROW IS THIS HIS ZOMBIE BANK
I DON'T THINK IT IS A ZOMBIE BANK I THINK YOU HAVE TO TRY AND LOOK THROUGH THE LOSSES WHICH ARE EFFECTIVELY PAYING FOR THAT THE SINS OF THE PAST AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IN THE BANK AT THE MOMENT IT'S REFOCUSING ITS TRYING TO REBUILD ITS FRANCHISE WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND WITH CORPORATE CUSTOMERS
IT WAS TAKEN OUT MOST OF THE INVESTMENT BANKING IT IS CLEANING UP ITS ACT IT'S STILL GOT SOME WAY TO GO BUT EVENTUALLY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE BANK THE GOVERNMENT ARE ALREADY SOLD OFF A LITTLE CHUNK ABOUT SIX PER CENT OF ITS HOLDING A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WANTS TO KEEP DOING THAT I MEAN AS A BUYER BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE A CAT YOU'RE AN INVESTMENT MANAGER YOU INTERESTED IN BUYING BITS OF A BEER
WHAT I THINK AND IN THE LONGER TERM THIS WILL PROBABLY MAKE SHAREHOLDERS A VERY GOOD RETURN MIGHT NOT BE AS IMMEDIATE AS SUMMERS AT SOME OF THE OTHER BANKS BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON PRICE AND SENSIBLE INVESTMENT LEVELS I THINK THAT COULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT BECAUSE THE WHOLE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT HAS THE PROBLEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY LOW INTEREST IT'S YES O.K. RICHARD JEFF RICH INVESTOR OSSICLES CATHOLIC CATTLE MANAGEMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT
NOW I'VE SPENT THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS INTERVIEWING BOSSES OF SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COMPANIES ON THE SMALLEST COMPANIES AS WELL ON THIS PROGRAMME SO IT'S ABOUT TIME PERHAPS WE SPOKE TO THE WORKERS' MY FINAL FRIDAY BOSS MY FINAL FOR OF US IT WILL CONTINUE HIS FRANCES O'GRADY THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE TRADE UNION CONGRESS COMMITTEE FRANCIS GOOD MORNING FINE LET'S GET THAT AND WHERE DOES THE VOICE OF LABOUR THE VOICE OF THE WORKER NEED TO BE HEARD MOST IMPORTANTLY RIGHT NOW
WELL WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CHALLENGES SO WE KNOW THAT I MEAN SINCE YOU'VE BEEN PRESENTING ON THIS PROGRAMME WE'VE SEEN AND SOME PRETTY TOUGH TIMES FOR WORKERS I'M NOT I'M ALWAYS CONSCIOUS THAT MANY WORKERS LOVED THEIR JOBS THEY WANT TO FEEL PROUD OF THE ORGANISATIONS THEY WORK
BUT THEY'RE STILL ON AVERAGE FORTY FOUR POUNDS A WEEK WORSE OFF THAN THEY WERE FROM BEFORE THE FINANCIAL CRASH MORALE IS PRETTY LOW IN MANY AREAS BECAUSE OF THIS SOARAWAY PAY AT THE TOP IT DOESN'T FEEL GREAT IF YOU'RE WORKING HARD AND YOU SEEK THE TOPS FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BOSSES ON AN AVERAGE OF FIVE MILLION POUNDS
A LOT OF ANXIETY AND INSECURITY WITH THE GROWTH OF ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS IN PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT AND THEN OF COURSE THOSE PUBLIC SECTOR CUTS ARE REALLY TAKING THEIR TOLL ON SERVICES WHICH IS KIND OF PART OF THE PACKAGE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES DO YOU THINK THAT I MEAN THE UNION MEMBERSHIP HAS HALVED SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK
LABOUR HAS AN EFFECTIVE VOICE BOTH POLITICALLY AND TALKING ABOUT THE LABOUR PARTY AS WELL AT THE MOMENT AT THIS JUNCTURE
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY THAT MEMBERSHIP HAS DECLINED ALTHOUGH IT'S HELD PRETTY STEADY IN RECENT YEARS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN SOME MODEST GROWTHS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE'RE STILL SIX MILLION STRONG BUT WITHOUT
IF WE COULD DOUBLE THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE AFFECTED IN THE WORKPLACE WOULD HAVE A STRONGER VOICE POLITICALLY IN TERMS OF JUST BEING ABLE TO STAND UP FOR WORKING PEOPLE IN THE ISSUES THEY CARE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CURRENT LABOUR PARTY DO YOU THINK OF IT IT'S AN EFFECTIVE VOICE FOR
THAT THE INTEREST THAT YOU TALK ABOUT WELL I THINK IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS WE'VE GOT IN THE LEADERSHIP TEAM SAYING EXPRESSING MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT ORDINARY PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE N.H.S. CHILDCARE AND SO ON BUT YOU KNOW I THINK OUR CONCERNS WE DEAL WITH ANY GOVERNMENT THAT'S IN POWER BUT OF COURSE CURRENTLY WE'VE GOT THIS TRADE UNION BILL
BEFORE PARLIAMENT THAT'S DESIGNED TO WEAKEN WORKERS BARGAINING POWER BY ATTACKING WHAT IS A LAST RESORT THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL LIBERTY IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO STRIKE AND THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY WORRYING AND IT'S WORRYING POLITICIANS FROM ALL SIDES OF THE HOUSE I HAVE TO SAY WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WHICH IS LOOMING OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF THIS PROGRAMME IS IS THE E.U. REFERENDUM
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE VOICE WE HAVE I MEAN BY AND LARGE AND AND THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS QUITE A FEW OF THEM THE BIGGER THE BUSINESSES THE MORE INCLINED THEY ARE TO BE IN AS THEY SAY THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS WHAT DO YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE WAY FOR OWNERS OF BUSINESSES ARE MANAGES TO TRY AND INFLUENCE THE WAY PEOPLE VOTE
WELL I THINK THEY NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS HER CITIZENS WHO GET BOATS NOT BUSINESSES AND THERE IS A DANGER THAT THIS DEBATE IS BECOMING SO DOMINATED BY THE BUSINESS BOYS BUT WE'RE FORGETTING ABOUT WHAT MATTERS
TO ORDINARY VOTERS AND CERTAINLY FROM A WORKER'S POINT OF VIEW I THINK THE BIG BIG QUESTION THAT THE BRICKS IT CAMP AND STILL ANSWER IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ALL THOSE RIGHTS AT WORK FROM MATERNITY LEAVE TO EQUAL PAY TO PAID HOLIDAYS
CONSULTATION WITH SENTENCES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE IF WE LEFT THE E.U. AND DO WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE EMPOWERED NOW WOULD PROTECT THOSE FRIGHTS BECAUSE I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE EUROPE YES IT'S A BIG SINGLE MARKET THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR JOBS AND INVESTMENT BUT IT HAS TO BE BALANCED BY STRONG RIGHT SOME PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS TO FRANCES O'GRADY THANK YOU MY FINAL FOR THEIR BOSS WHAT'S THAT
TRADING'S COMPRESS GENERAL SECRETARY BUT HOLD ON SIMON BECAUSE IT IS AS YOU SAID AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING YOUR LAST DAY GOING ON TO BE THE B.B.C.'S HIS BUSINESS EVER SAY YOU'VE BEEN HERE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AND WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER SOME OF THAT ABSOLUTE TIP TOP HIGHLIGHTS OF YOUR BROADCASTING SIMON WILL TELL US ABOUT IT SIMON'S ON HUMOUR

THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THE B. B. C. ADMITS THAT IT FAILED THE VICTIMS OF JIMMY SAVILE BUT THEIR LAWYERS ARE NOT HAPPY AT ALL THEY BELIEVE THAT THEN JANET SMITH SIR A REPORT WAS A WHITE WASH THAT PLUS OTHER B. B. C. HIS REASONS FOR FIRING TONY BLACKBURN UNDERSTANDABLE AND WATERTIGHT THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS SWIRLING ABOUT TODAY LUCY MANNING'S SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT I SUPPOSE THE QUESTION REALLY LUCY'S WHAT HAPPENS
ALL THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT THE FINAL BIG REPORT INTO JIMMY SAVILE IT IS ANOTHER ONE OF THE REPORTS WHERE IT FINDS NOBODY AT THE TOP SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS GOING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIM BUT IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OR IN THE MIDDLE IT DID JAME JANET'S REPORT TALKS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE AT THE B.B.C. THAT DID HEAR RUMOURS AND STORIES ABOUT HIM INCLUDING SOME QUITE SENIOR PEOPLE AT ESTHER RANTZEN LOUIS THEROUX LORD GRADE
TERRY WOGAN AND AT LORD HALL THE B.B.C. DIRECTOR GENERAL YESTERDAY ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS A VERY DARK DAY FOR THE B. B. C. AND DID APOLOGISE THE VICTIMS BUT HE ALSO PROMISED THAT THERE WOULD BE CHANGES IN REVIEWS BECAUSE DAME JANET SMITH REPORT FOUND THAT THERE WAS STILL A SOMEWHAT OF A CULTURE OF FEAR AT THE B.B.C. WHERE PEOPLE WERE STILL SCARED TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE COMPLAINTS LORD HALL HAS PROMISE THAT THERE WILL BE CHANGES
HE ADMITTED THAT THE B. B. C. HAD MANY FAILINGS AND HE'S GOING TO TRY AND CHANGE THINGS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE RAISE CONCERN YOU WONDER IF ONE OF THOSE CHANGES MIGHT BE BRINGING BACK LIZ MCLEAN AND AARON JONES OR TO NEWSNIGHT JOURNALIST TWO CAME UP OF COURSE WITH THE THAT THE STORY THAT JIMMY SAVILE WAS AN ABUSE OF THE STORY WAS THEN DROPPED HIM IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES INFAMOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THEY OF COURSE THEY SAY THEY WERE FORCED OUT OF THE B.B.C.
WHAT WILL THAT THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT THAT THERE WAS THE ISSUE SOME YEARS AGO WHERE THE B.B.C. DIDN'T RUN THE STORY ABOUT JIMMY SAV ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO I.T.V. TO BREAK THAT STORY AND I THINK CERTAINLY THE STORY THAT BROKERED OF JIMMY SEVERAL SOME YEARS AGO THAT HOW THAT REPORTING HAS BEEN VINDICATED AND THE B. B. C. WAS SLOW
TO REPORT IT THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY AN INQUIRY INTO WHAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME BUT LORD HALL YESTERDAY ADMITTED THAT CERTAINLY ON ON PEOPLE COMING FORWARD ON PEOPLE WHISTLE BLOWING AT THE B. B. C. HAVEN'T GOT IT RIGHT I MEAN THAT FIGURE OF HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT THEY'D SORRY LUKE LUCY I WAS WOOD DID YOU GET THE IMPRESSION HE WAS TALKING THEN ABOUT LIZ MCKINNEY MARION JONES NO I THINK I THINK IT WAS MORE HISTORICALLY WHAT HE WHAT HE WAS TALKING OVERALL ABOUT THE B. B. C. AND ABOUT THE
I GET THIS PHRASE THE CULTURE OF FEAR THAT THAT STOP PEOPLE COMING FORWARD THAT TALENT WAS SEEN AS TOO UNTOUCHABLE HE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH ON THE JOURNALISM HE WAS ACTUALLY ASKED BY AN I.T.V. REPORTER ABOUT THE B.B.C.'S FAILURE TO SORT OF GRAPPLE WITH WITH THESE ISSUES BUT HE WHAT HE WAS REALLY DEALING WITH I SUPPOSE THE FAILURES TO PROTECT THOSE
PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO THE B.B.C. AUDIENCE PEOPLE FOR JIM'LL FIX IT AND TOP OF THE POPS THAT WEREN'T PROTECTED AND THEN THE FAILURE TO LISTEN TO SOME STAFF WHO DID RAISE COMPLAINTS THERE IS THIS KEY PHRASE WHEN SOMEBODY RAISED IT THAT SHE WAS TOLD SHUT UP JIMMY SADDLES OF A V.I.P. AND THAT WASN'T DEALT WITH OH KAY LUCY MANNING THANK YOU
THIRTY TWO SORRY TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN MICHAEL HOWARD THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER THE LEADER AND THE MAN WHO DAVID CAMERON USED TO WORK FOR OF COURSE WILL BE CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ROSS HAWKINS IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS THE PRIME MINISTER ISN'T IT YEAH THE SIGNIFICANCE IS NOT JUST THAT DAVID CAMERON'S FORMER
BOSS BOTH ADVISE RUNNERS AND OPPOSITION FROM VENTURE COMES TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ON THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT IT'S THAT HE QUESTIONS THE JUDGEMENT'S THE PRIME MINISTER HAS MADE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS ARTICLE DAVID CAMERON SAYS THE IDEA OF ANOTHER RENEGOTIATION AFTER AN OUTVOTE IS FOR THE BIRDS MICHAEL HOWARD CLEARLY APPEARS TO DISAGREE DAVID CAMERON SAYS HIS WELFARE DEAL WILL HAVE AN IMPACT MICHAEL HOWARD SAYS IT'S NOT CLEAR THE BENEFITS DEAL WILL ACTUALLY WORK HE CALLS THE RENEGOTIATION OF FAILURE BUT
BLAMES EUROPE FOR NOW FOR HIM TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE VIEW WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER SURPRISE I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE HE'S SHIFT FROM STATING HIMSELF AS A EURO SCEPTIC TO SOMEONE WHO SAYS WE MUST TO GO IS PRETTY IMPORTANT AS I THINK OF LAST WEEK SOMETHING RATHER DRAMATIC HAS HAPPENED TO THE CONSERVATIVE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY FOR YEARS
TORY M.P.S HAVE BEEN VERY WILLING TO SAY WE ARE EUROSCEPTICS RATHER LESS WILLING TO SAY WE WANT OUT OF THE E.U. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT CLUB NOW THAT IS A VERY BIG OR VERY SIGNIFICANT CLUB IT INCLUDES SOME VERY HEAVYWEIGHT POLITICAL FIGURES AND THAT IS HUGE THE INVOLVED AND THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE US OUT OF EUROPE
AND YET HE'S ALSO SAYING LIKE BORIS JOHNSON IS THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER DEAL RENEGOTIATE BUT RE NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL FROM EUROPE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES OF JUDGEMENT I THINK HE
ARGUES THAT WERE BRITAIN TO VOTE LEAVE THEN THE IN EUROPE WOULD HAVE TO SIMPLY TAKE A DIFFERENT LOOK AND THAT RATHER THAN SIMPLY HAVING THE IMAGE THE NEGOTIATION THAT WE EXPECT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT THEY MIGHT COME BACK TO US WITH A BETTER OFFER THAT BRITAIN WOULD HAVE A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION DAVID CAMERON WAS ACTUALLY WITH A RING ABOUT THAT VIEW AT THE START OF THE WEEK AND THAT IS WHERE THE DIFFICULTY IS GOING TO LIKE THAT TOO I THINK
ALSO WITH THE RANCOUR HUGE ANGER GOING ON THERE WAS RATHER CIVILISED DEBATE ABOUT THE IN THE CHAMBER IN THE CORRIDORS AROUND THE OUTSIDE PEOPLE WERE WERE FURIOUS FURIOUS AT LATE CONVERTS TO REMAIN WHO THEY WERE CALLING TO SEAT FULL DECEPTIVE AND MUCH WORSE THE IDEA I THINK THAT THE SCEPTICS ACCEPT WAS A FAIR FIGHT HAS SIMPLY GONE THERE IS A REAL ANGER AMONGST THE I.D. EUROSCEPTIC MINISTERS WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE GOVERNMENT PAPERS AND ALSO ABOUT WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A RATHER TECHNICAL POINT THE PRIME MINISTER
PROMISING TO IMPLEMENT ARTICLE FIFTY OF THE LISBON TREATY TO START THE FORMAL TWO YEAR PROCESS TO GO CHASING TO LEAVE STRAIGHTAWAY ONE SCEPTIC SAID TO BE CAME OUT TO BE FURIOUS STEAMING ABOUT THIS ARGUING THAT IT WASN'T SMART IT WASN'T SMART NEGOTIATION IT WAS A PLEDGED TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT LEAVING
AND SUGGESTING THAT IF THAT POSITION DIDN'T CHANGE WAS A POSSIBILITY THIS M.P. AND HE WOULD TRY AND SIX OF HIS COLLEAGUES TO DO SO AS WELL CAN YOU CAN QUESTION THE PRIME MINISTER'S POSITION BEFORE A REFERENDUM THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF RANCOUR OUT THERE ANY IDEA OF A PURELY CIVILISED ABOUT I THINK MAY HAVE GONE IN JUST A FEW DAYS
I SAW KIDS THANKS VERY MUCH WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO LORD HOWARD ATTEND WEIGHTS ONE NINETY MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND MANY OF THEM HIGHLIGHT THAT RISE IN NET MIGRATION THE TIMES WORRYING THAT THE FIGURE OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND HAS BECOME THE NORM IN THE MALE URGES DAVID CAMERON OR PULL THE OTHER ONE LAUGHTER HERE AGAIN INSISTED NET MIGRATION COULD BE REDUCED TO BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE GUARDIAN TAKES A POSITIVE VIEW ARGUING THAT THE FIGURE IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND LOWER THAN THE RECORD LEVEL RECORDED LAST JUNE THE FLOW OF E.U. MIGRANTS TO WORK IN BRITAIN IS PETE
AND APPEARS TO BE STABILISING SON HOWEVER IS FURIOUS ABOUT THE FIGURES AND DEVOTES ITS ENTIRE EDITORIAL TO THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION UNDER THE HEADLINE SHAM CAM IT CLAIMS THE GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO CONTROL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE U.K. IS NO ACCIDENT MASS IMMIGRATION IT SAYS IS WHAT THE TREASURY WANTS AS ONLY BY RAPIDLY INFLATING THE POPULATION WITH CHEAP WORKERS CAN GEORGE OSBORNE ACHIEVE HIS PROMISED BUDGET SURPLUS ARGUING THAT IMMIGRATION IS A MAJOR WORRY FOR VOTERS IT ACCUSES DAVID CAMPBELL OF COOKING UP A TOUGH SOUNDING POLICY
THAT WON'T BE EXPOSED AS A FRAUD UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE THERE'S WIDESPREAD CRITICISM OF THE B. B. C. FOLLOWING THE INQUIRY INTO SEXUAL ABUSE OF THE CORPORATION THE MALE IS OUTRAGED AT THE REPORT DOES NOT APPORTION BLAME DESCRIBING THE INQUIRY IS AN EXPENSIVE WHITE WASH THAT FAILS JIMMY SAVILE'S VICTIMS ALL OVER AGAIN THE TELEGRAPH AGREES SUGGESTING THE INQUIRY INTO SAVELOYS ITSELF TAINTED BY THE DEFERENTIAL CULTURE THAT SHIELDED HIM FOR THE TIMES OF B. B. C. REMAINS TOO BIG FOR LICENCE P. PAIRS TO HAVE FAITH IN FAKE PROMISES TO REFORM ITS CORPORATE CULTURE
THE MIRROR CLAIMS TO HAVE OBTAINED SECRET BEAD MEMOS WHICH RESULTED IN TONY BLACKBURN BEING SACKED BY THE CORPORATION IT SAYS THE DOCUMENTS CONTRADICT EVIDENCE GIVEN BY THE D.J. TO THE ABUSE ENQUIRY IMPROVE HE WAS QUIZZED BY B. B. C. MANAGERS IN THE SEVENTIES OVER CLAIMS HE SEDUCED A TEENAGER WHO LATER KILLED HERSELF MY BLACKBURN HAS DENIED THE INTERVIEWS TO PLACE AND SAID HE WAS CLEARED OF WRONGDOING FOR THE MIRROR THE PAPERS ARE FURTHER EVIDENCE POINTING TO A COVER UP INVOLVING THE B. B. C. THE POLICE AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM
FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NICK CLEGG AS TOLD THE INDEPENDENT IS FORMER COALITION PARTNERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A ONE PARTY STATE IT ONCE DESCRIBED AS HIS FIRST MAJOR INTERVIEW SINCE LOSING OFFICE MISTER CLEGG ACCUSES THE CONSERVATIVES OF RIGGING THE RULES AGAINST THEIR OPPONENTS' LEAVING MILLIONS OF VOTERS COMPLETELY PRICELESS HE SAYS HE'S BEEN PROVOKED INTO CRITICISING DAVID CAMERON OFF THE PRIME MINISTER USED ONE NATION RHETORIC TO MASK MOVE AWAY FROM THE COALITION IS PROGRESSIVE POLICIES
ALL OF THE PAPERS TAKE DELIGHT IN THE RETURN OF THE FLYING SCOTSMAN BUT SEVERAL USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CRITICISE THEIR PUNCTUALITY OF BRITAIN'S TRAINS AT NEARLY AN HOUR LATER AND IT'S RUN FROM LONDON TO YORK ESTATE SAYS THE MAYOR THE BLAST FROM THE PAST IS OPERATING TO A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TIMETABLE
THE TELEGRAPH EXPRESS OR SYMPATHY FOR RYAN ALAN WHO DROVE FIFTY MILES TO WATCH THE LEGENDARY LOCOMOTIVE STEAM PAST THEY NEED TO FIND A MODERN TRAIN TRAVEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ENTIRELY BLOCKING HIS VIEW TYPICAL HE SAID I HAD A FEELING
THEY'VE GOT THE PHOTOS TO SEVER THE PAPERS THEY ARE HEARTBREAKING FOR HIM QUITE FUNNY TOO TO SEE SEVENTEEN MINUTES AND SENT THE MAIN HEADLINE IT'S MORNING DAVID CAMERON'S PREDECESSOR AS CONSERVATIVE LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD AND SAID HE IS BACKING THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE EUROPEAN
IF THE UNITED KINGDOM WANTS TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE FOREIGN SECRETARY WARNED YESTERDAY THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES WOULD VIEW IT AS TWO FINGERS FROM THE U.K. BUT A CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHER SAID THE U.K. WOULD STILL BE BETTER OFF OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD NO LONGER BE RULED BY UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS ARE PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HERE REPORTS
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND SAYS HE'S ALWAYS CONSIDERED HIMSELF A EURO SCEPTIC BUT HE REVEALED THAT ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW THEM OVER THERE THEY'RE NOT SUCH A BAD CROWD AFTER ALL
FIRST AS DEFENCE SECRETARY AND NOW AS FOREIGN SECRETARY I'VE SEEN HOW IN PRACTICE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE E.U. PARTNERS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN OUR ARMOURY
AND EVEN IF HE'S COME ROUND TO THEM HE WANTED TO BE CLEAR OUR PARTNERS IN EUROPE WOULDN'T BE FALLING OVER THEMSELVES TO SIGN LUCRATIVE TRADE DEALS WITH THE DEPARTING UNITED KINGDOM LEAVES SO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY MEANT LEAVE
THERE WILL BE NO DESIRE AT ALL AMONG THE POLITICAL ELITES OF THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES TO HELP AN EXITING BRITAIN SHOW THAT IT CAN PROSPER OUTSIDE THE QUITE THE CONTRARY
THEY WILL INTERPRET A LEAVE DECISION AS TWO FINGERS FROM THE U.K. AND WE CAN EXPECT PRECISELY THE SAME IN RETURN BUT A CONSERVATIVE NIGEL EVANS INTERRUPTED TO SAY GERMANY EXPORTED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS MORE OF GOODS TO US THAN WE DID TO THEM
I'M INTERESTED IN HIS JUDGEMENT AS TO THE CHARACTER OF A FELLOW YOU COUNTRIES IS HE REALLY SAID
THAT GERMANY WILL BE SO VINDICTIVE AND SPITEFUL AT THEY WERE CUT THEIR OWN NOSES OFF TO SPITE THEIR FACE THE S.N.P. IS PATRICK GRADY FELT HE HAD PLENTY FROM WHICH TO BE THANKFUL
THERE'S A DIVERGENCE ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH CLEAR MAJORITIES IN SCOTLAND IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CAN SUDDENLY MORE SYMPATHETICALLY EUROPEAN PROJECT I GREW UP IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS WERE REG AT BRIDGES AND ROADS SIMPLY WOULDN'T EXIST IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BLUE STARS THAT WE SAW THE GOLD STARS AND THE BLUE FLAG THAT WE SAW PINNED AGAINST HILARY BENN THE SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY RECALLED THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR CREATING THE EUROPEAN UNION
IT IS BROUGHT PEACE TO A CONTINENT THAT FUN HUNDREDS OF YEARS WAS SCARRED BY WAR
AND ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN
TO WALK ALONG THE ROWS OF GRAVES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND WORLD WARS WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS THE FLOWER TO GENERATIONS OF EUROPEANS SOME BEARING THE NAMES HOW YOUNG THEY WERE OTHERS NO NAME AT ALL THE GRAVESTONES SIMPLY READS A SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR KNOWN UNTO GOD BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE KNEW WHOSE FATHER
OR UNCLE OR NEPHEW OR BROTHER
LIES BENEATH AND IN THE SAME VEIN THE CONSERVATIVE SIR NICHOLAS SOAMES COURTED HIS GRANDFATHER SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL SPEAKING TO THE CONGRESS OF EUROPE IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT THIS IS WHAT CHURCHILL SAID AT THE HAGUE
A HIGH AND SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY RESTS UPON US HERE THIS AFTERNOON IN THIS CONGRESS OVER EUROPE STRIVING TO BE REBORN
IF WE'LL LOWER OURSELVES TO BE RENTS AND DISORDERED BY PETTINESS AND SMALL DISC
IF WE FAIL AND CLARITY OF VIEW OR COURAGE
A PRICELESS OCCASION MAYBE CASTAWAY FOREVER MIND YOU WERE CONSERVATIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT RICHARD DRAX ACTUALLY LIKES EUROPE
I WANT TO ENJOY THEIR CULTURE THEIR LANGUAGES AND MODE
THE SCENES THERE WAS A BUT COMING BUT I DO NOT AND MILLIONS IN THIS
DO NOT WANT TO BE RUDE
ARNOLD LIKED IT BUREAUCRATS AND THERE'S NO DOUBT SOME CONSERVATIVE EURO SCEPTICS FEEL CHEATED THE PRIME MINISTER HAD PROMISED THEM CHANGE AND THEY RECKON HE FAILED TO GET IT JACOB REES MOGG FELT IT KEENLY
IF MY DEPUTY SPEAKER IT WAS SO DANGEROUS WHY DID THE PRIME MINISTER OFFER US A REFERENDUM IF HE THOUGHT THE WORLD WOULD COLLAPSE ON THE DAY WE VOTED NO IS SHE SOME HULA COME SOME WHO WHO THINKS THAT IT IS SAFE TO RISK THIS NATION'S FUTURE BY TRUSTING OF PEOPLE
WHEN HE SAID HE RULED NOTHING OUT SURELY HE MEANT IT SURELY HE WAS NOT SAYING THAT IN FACT HE WAS ALWAYS GOING TO GO ALONG WITH WHATEVER OUR FRIENDS IN BRUSSELS
WELL THE EUROPE MINISTER DAVID LUDDINGTON GRANTED EUROSCEPTICS SCEPTICS ONE THING AT LEAST HE SAID THEY WERE CONSISTENT PRINT IF THE PRIME MINISTER HAD COME BACK FROM BRUSSELS
BRANDISHING THE SEVERED HEADS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT AN AUTO DA FE IN DOWNING STREET HAVE COPIES OF THE LISBON TREATY THEY WOULD STILL BE SAYING THIS IS FEEBLE INSUFFICIENT NOT
GOODNESS WHEN IT COMES TO SPEAKING UP FOR EUROPE NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION CHRIS ISN'T ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT MORE FROM HER ON EIGHT THIRTY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE TIME NOW AND THE MINISTER SAID THE GREAT MIGRANT CON THAT'S A HEADLINE IN THE SUN THIS MORNING PICKING UP ON A QUESTION RAISED BY THE ECONOMIST JONATHAN PORTERS OF METER THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH
THE QUESTION HOW CAN THE OFFICIAL MIGRATION FIGURES YESTERDAY SHOWED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND E.U. MIGRANTS CAME TO BRITAIN LAST YEAR WHEN MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND REGISTERED FOR A NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER WELL MADELEINE SUMP IS DIRECTOR OF THE OXFORD MIGRATION OBSERVATORY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE
WELL WE DON'T NECESSARILY EXPECT THE TWO DATA SETS TO SAY EXACTLY THE SAME THING AND THAT THE BIGGEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COUNTED IN THE IMMIGRATION STATISTICS THE JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THAT YOU MENTIONED FRONT FRONT DO YOU THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FOR AT LEAST A YEAR NOW PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERING FOR NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER WE'D GET THAT NATIONAL INSURANCE EVEN IF IT EVEN IF THEY JUST COMING FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND SO ONE OF THEIR EX POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DISCREPANCY
HIS SHORT TERM MIGRATION OH KAY BUT ONE CAN PRESUME THAT THAT WOULD BE APPLY EVERY YEAR ARE THEY TYPICALLY THIS DIFFERENT
THERE HAS BEEN A GAP THAT HAS OPENED UP PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WE WILL AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE STATISTICS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHAT IS GOING ON AND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS DOES ACTUALLY RELEASE SHORT TERM MIGRATION DATA AND THAT WILL COME OUT
FOR TWENTY FOURTEEN IN IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME IN MAY AND AT THAT POINT WILL BE ABLE TO SEE
HOPEFULLY HOW MUCH SHORT TERM MIGRATION SEEMS TO BE EXPLAINING IT ALL WHETHER THERE'S SOME PROBLEM WITH WITH ANNIE INFLOW FIGURES THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY'RE UNDER COUNTING MIGRANTS FOR EXAMPLE BUT AS YOU SAY THAT'LL THAT'LL BE FOR TWENTY FOURTEEN SO STILL SOME AT A YEAR OR SO AGO
YES IT TAKES QUITE A WHILE FOR THOSE STATISTICS TO TO BE COMPLETED AND COLLECTED THAT MOST OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS AND THE IMMIGRATION NUMBERS DID ACTUALLY OPEN UP DURING TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IT WILL STICK IT WILL BE QUITE IMPORTANT WHEN WE GET THOSE THOSE FIGURES TO GET A BETTER PICTURE O.K. AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE FEELING IS WHICH ONE IS THE OUTLINE
YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S A RATHER BORING EXPLANATION WHICH IS THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE MEASURING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MEASURE CORRECTLY AND THAT THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF SHORT TERM MIGRATION BUT WILL REALLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THOSE FIGURES NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET A SENSE AT THAT OH KAY BECAUSE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUS FIGURE IS
ARE RECORDED BY QUESTIONS ASKED TO PEOPLE AS THEY ARRIVE IN THE COMPANY COUNTRY HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN TO STAY HERE
YES EXACTLY AND WE KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE SOME PROBLEMS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO STAY WHEN THEY GIVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AT PEOPLE MAY COME IN LOOK FOR A JOB NOT FIND ONE AND THEN GO HOME AGAIN IN AND DURING THAT TIME THEY MAY ACTUALLY ALSO APPLIED FOR A NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S THAT THE ISSUE AS WITH THE WITH THE SURVEY DATA IT'S A SURVEY IT'S IMPERFECT BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT
THAT BOTH OF THESE THESE DATA SOURCES ARE GIVING EM A SOMEWHAT ACCURATE PICTURE WE NEED TO BE PATIENT UNTIL MAY MADELEINE SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN IF YOU'RE A TEACHER YOU'RE PROBABLY UP EARLY GETTING READY FOR YOUR CLASSES TODAY OR PERHAPS YOU'RE GETTING AN EARLY FLIGHT TO SOMEWHERE NICE WHERE YOU CAN EARN A TAX FREE SALARY IN THE SUNSHINE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW HAS PUBLISHED A PAPER ASKING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO KEEP TEACHERS TEACHING YEAH
SO MY PLACE IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND YOU ARE WORRIED THAT REALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS ARE GOING ABROAD YET AS WE HAVE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE TWENTY PER CENT INCREASE OF TEACHERS TRAINED HERE GOING ABROAD GOING TO THE MIDDLE EAST KIND RAW NUMBERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THAT'S MORE THAN A SIZEABLE NUMBER MORE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN POST GRADUATE COURSES LAST YEAR FOR TEACHING SO IT'S A VERY BIG NUMBERS WHO'VE GOT OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ENGLISH TRAINED TEACHERS
TEACHING IN A TEACHING ABROAD SAY MAINLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST MAINLY IN IN IN THE FAR EAST AND IN THE BURGEONING NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS ARE BEING SPONSORED FRANCHISED BY OUR INDEPENDENT SCHOOL YES I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT THE FACT WASN'T THAT'S IT IS IT THAT BRITISH FAVOURITE SCHOOL EDUCATION IS SUCH A BRAND ACROSS THE WORLD THAT'S RIGHT AND IT IS IT IS SUCH A BRAND IN MANY WAYS THAT A GREAT BRAND
BUT IT'S TAKING AWAY TEACHERS FROM OUR OWN STATE STATE SCHOOLS HOW DO WE STOP IT HAPPENING BUT WE WE STOP IT HEART HAPPENING BY UP ASKING VARIOUS QUESTIONS IN THE QUESTIONS I IF WE'RE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON TRAINING TEACHERS HERE
IF WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON SUBSIDIES FOR MATHS AND PHYSICS TEACHERS AND SCIENCE TEACHERS ISN'T THERE A MORAL OBLIGATION BUT ALSO AN ECONOMIC OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THE TAXPAYER'S MONEY'S KEEPS THOSE PEOPLE HERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME I'M TALKING TODAY ABOUT GOLDEN HANDCUFFS FOR THOSE TEACHERS TO KEEP THEM HERE WHICH WOULD WORK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THEY WOULD BE CONTRACTED
WITH GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY STAYED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE CONSIDERING MOVING AS DRINK ARTHUR HAS NOT IF GOOD IT IS IT IS A HANK I BET IT'S GOLD BUT IT IS A QUID PRO QUO TO SAY WITH WHERE WE'RE SPENDING MONEY TRAINING IN A LOT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING MONEY SUBSIDISING YOUR TRAINING AND ENSURING THAT WE WEAR WE GET THE BEST PEOPLE
THIS SURELY AN OBLIGATION FOR YOU TO START YOUR TEACHING IN THIS COUNTRY WHAT A LOT OF THE TEACHERS SAY AND CERTAINLY THE TEACHING UNIONS WOULD SAYS STOP MESSING ABOUT WITH ACADEMIES AND FREE SCHOOLS AND TESTING FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT UPSET A LOT OF TEACHERS AND LET TEACHERS TEACH IN OTHER WORDS IMPROVE THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROFESSION FEELS TO BE A PART OF AND THAT WOULD SOLVE IT FOR YOU
WELL THEY MIGHT SAY THEY MIGHT SAY THAT BUT OFSTED IS ABOUT IMPROVING STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE ALL SCHOOLS ARE GOOD SCHOOLS AND WE AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD SCHOOLS IN THIS
IN THIS COUNTRY WE WANT TEACHERS TO REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY TO TEACH IN THOSE COULD YOU DON'T I THINK IT'S TIME TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE GRIPES ABOUT THE WAY THEY'RE TREATED THAT THAT CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MIGHT WANT TO CHUCK IT IN AND GO ABROAD TEACHING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DIFFICULT JOB AND I'VE BEEN TEACHING HER TEACHER FOR OVER FORTY YEARS COURSE IS DIFFICULT BUT
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOY'S IN TEACHING AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOYS AND TEACHING IN THE TOUGHEST AREAS WE WANT THE BEST TEACHERS TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY AND TEACHING THOSE AREAS I'VE BEEN IN MANCHESTER AND IN STOKE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS
THEY STAND AS THEY ARE PITIFULLY LOW IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN THOSE TWO CITIES NOW SOME OF IT'S DOWN TO POOR LEADERSHIP SOME STAND POOR TEACHING SOME OF IT IS BECAUSE IT JUST CAN'T GET SPECIALIST TEACHERS AND THEY NEED LOTS OF HELP AND LOTS OF SUPPORT COULD WE AFFORD
TO PAY TEACHERS MORE IN A WAY THAT MADE
A DIFFERENCE AND PREVENTED THEM GOING OFF TO THE SCHOOLS ABROAD I MEAN I DID IS THERE A SALARY DIFFERENCE THAT YOU THINK COULD WORK WELL THEY THEY'RE ARE SUBSIDIES ABROAD AND SALARIES AND THEY'RE JUST WOULDN'T WORK THERE AND FREE ACCOMMODATION AND SO ON AND SO THAT WOULD BE DEATH AND TAXES THERE ISN'T REALLY A SALARY WAY OUT OR HIS ASSISTANT AND A TIME OF AUSTERITY I CAN'T SEE THAT THE HAPPENING WE'VE GOT TO DO IS TO IS TO SAY LOOK WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON TRAINING TEACHERS
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY STAY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND IN THAT WAY A CONTRACTUAL THING ON THERE WILL BE HOW MANY YEARS WELL THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AND CAME TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO BE DIRECTED INTO INTO SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE THE MOVEABLE SURE TEACHERS WILL BE IN TOUCH DURING THE COURSE OF THE MORNING SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST AND CHRIS FOXES HERE BUT

THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE CONTEST TO BE THE REPUBLICANS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAS COME UNDER STRONG ATTACK FROM HIS CLOSEST RIVALS IN THE LATEST TELEVISED DEBATE SENATORS MARKLE RUBIO AND TED CREWS TRIED TO USE THE EVENT TO REDUCE MY TRUMPS LEAD IN THE POLLS BEFORE ELEVEN STATES VOTE ON TUESDAY FROM KANSAS A CORRESPONDENT GARY O'DONAHUE REPORTS
UP UNTIL NOW THERE'S BEEN SOME RELUCTANCE AMONG THE CANDIDATES TO TAKE DONALD TRUMP ON DIRECTLY FEARFUL OF HIS BROAD APPEAL THAT HAS NOW CHANGED SENATORS RUBIO AND CRUISE LAID INTO THE FRONT RUNNER ON EVERYTHING FROM IMMIGRATION TO HEALTH CARE TO THE MIDDLE EAST
DONALD TRUMP APPEARED TO RELISH THE ENCOUNTERS LASHING OUT WITH PERSONAL INSULTS TED CRUISE WAS A LIAR AND A BASKET CASE MARCO RUBIO OR CHOKE ARTIST
IN TRUTH BOTH SENATORS NEEDED SOME KIND OF BREAKOUT MOMENT IN THIS DEBATE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY DID RAISE THEIR GAME
BUT DONALD TRUMP IS STILL SUBSTANTIALLY AHEAD IN MOST OF THE STATES THAT VOTE NEXT WEEK AND HE COULD BUILD A LEAD THEN THAT'S HARD TO SURMOUNT
NEW FIGURES SHOW THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS FOR PEOPLE TRAFFICKING OFFENCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS REACHED A RECORD LEVEL ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED BETWEEN APRIL AND DECEMBER LAST YEAR FOR SHORT OF THE TOTAL FOR THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALISON SANDRA'S HAS AGREED NEW MEASURES WITH HER COUNTERPARTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING
IRAN IS HOLDING ITS FIRST NATION WIDE ELECTION SINCE IT SIGNED A DEAL WITH WORLD POWERS TO EASE SANCTIONS IN RETURN FOR LIMITING ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES IRANIANS WITH ELECT A NEW PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY OF EXPERTS WHICH APPOINTS THE COUNTRY'S SUPREME LEADER HE'S A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES ROBBINS
IRANIANS GO TO THE POLLS REGULARLY IN A COUNTRY OF DELIBERATE CONTRADICTIONS THE REGIME DERIVES LEGITIMACY FROM THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THAT SYSTEM IS RIGIDLY CONTROLLED TO EXCLUDE CANDIDATES SEEN AS AN OUTRIGHT THREAT TO DOMINANCE BY THE CLERICS
THIS TIME THE ELECTION OUTCOMES ARE PARTICULARLY INTRIGUING WILL THE PEOPLE OF IRAN REWARD MODERNISING POLITICIANS WHO OVERCAME CONSERVATIVE HARDLINERS TO CONCLUDE THE HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL LAST YEAR THAT RESULTED IN THE LIFTING OF MANY SANCTION STRANGLING THE ECONOMY AND OFFERS THE PROSPECT OF GREATER PROSPERITY AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD
OR WILL THE EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE NUMBER OF FLOATING VOTERS IN IRAN PREFER TO APPLY THE BRAKES AND ENDORSE MORE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE TO LIMIT THE POWER OF PRESIDENT
THE UNITED STATES HAS SUBMITTED A DRAFT RESOLUTION OF THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WHICH WOULD IMPOSE TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA FOLLOWING ITS LATEST NUCLEAR TEST MISSILE LAUNCH THE MEASURES HAVE THE SUPPORT OF CHINA
VOTERS IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC OR GOING TO THE POLLS IN THE GENERAL ELECTION FIVE YEARS AGO THE CENTRE RIGHT FEENA GIRL WON THE MOST SEATS IT'S GOVERNED SINCE THEN IN COALITION WITH LABOUR FIFTEEN OTHER PARTIES HAVE CANDIDATES THE BIGGEST BEING FIANNA FOIL AND SINN FEIN COUNTING BEGINS TOMORROW
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A FRENCH COURT HAS RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN FRANCE CAN CLEAR PART OF THE MIGRANT CAMP IN CALAIS KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE BUT THE MOON DOESN'T GIVEN OR GIVE ANY TIMETABLE THOUGHT ABOUT A THOUSAND MIGRANTS WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE EVICTION PLAN TO MUCH MORGAN A REPORTER IS THERE TOMOS DO WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW AND WHEN AS A RESULT OF THIS REALLY
YES THE AUTHORITIES SAY THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN INTO THEIR CAMP OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND WE CAN CONTINUE THAT PROCESS NOT POSTERS WILL BE TRYING TO PERSUADE THE MIGRANTS LIVING IN THIS SOUTHERN AREA OF THE CAMP TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND THEIR SHELTERS
IT'S IN THIS AREA CAMP WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES LIVE IN THE SOUTHERN AREAS NOW THEY WON'T BE FORCED TO LEAVE ACCORDING TO A TEARY MINISTER YESTERDAY THEY WILL AS THEY SAY BE PERSUADED TO LEAVE AND THEY HAVE THREE OPTIONS ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES THEY CAN EITHER GO INTO THE SPACES IN THE CONTAINERS OF THE AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT UP FOR THE MIGRANTS THEY CAN EITHER GO INTO WHERE THE REFUGEE CAMPS ACROSS FRANCE
ALL THEIR PREFERRED OPTION IS TO CLAIM ASYLUM AS THEY DON'T WANT THEIR MAKESHIFT CAMPS TO BE SPRINGING UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN COAST AND IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SAY IT'S ALREADY STARTED HAVE MANY PEOPLE TAKEN UP THEIR OFFERS
THE PAST TWO WEEKS OR SO THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE TAKEN
THE SPACES IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINERS THOSE HOUSING CONTAINERS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN TINA'S HERE HAVE GOT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY BUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NOW IN THOSE HOUSES THREE HUNDRED SPACES LEFT BUT OF COURSE DONE THIS SUDDEN AREA
AROUND WELL AT LEAST A THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING THERE ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES BUT AID AGENCY SAY THAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY A LOT HIGHER NOW WHERE THEY WILL GO WE'RE NOT SURE A LARGE NUMBER HAVE BEEN MOVING DOTTED AND KIRK OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HE'S A HUGE CAMP THERE WHICH IS IN THERE
FAR WORSE CONDITION THAN THIS ONE IN CALI AND OF COURSE AS WE KNOW THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES HAD NOW CHECKING THE BORDERS ARE MAKING SURE NONE OF THE MIGRANTS CROSS INTO THERE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT A CAMP TWO TO SPRING UP
NOW THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO BE A SOFTLY SOFTLY ONE BY THE AUTHORITIES HERE THEY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE A DISTURBANCE BUT AID WORKERS
HAVE CRITICISED THIS MOVE THAT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DEMOLISH SECTION THE CUB WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THEIR HOMES AS THEY SAY WELL THE SOCIAL STRUCTURES THE CHURCH AND SCHOOL WILL REMAIN BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE LIVING AROUND AND THEY WILL BECOME SEGREGATED AND IF EVERYONE LIVES IN THE NORTHERN KNEW THE CAMP WHICH IS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED METRES AWAY THAT WILL DISTURB THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN CREATED HERE THOMAS MORGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN OPERATION ELDON THE SCOTLAND YARD INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE PAYMENTS TO POLICE AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS BY JOURNALISTS HAS OFFICIALLY ENDED THEY TELL US THIS MORNING I PROMISED SIX YEARS THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE CONVICTED INCLUDING NINE POLICE OFFICERS AND THE GUARD SAYS IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX INVESTIGATIONS AT THE METRO AND POLICE HAS EVER DEALT WITH TOM SIMONS I'M HOME FIRST CORRESPONDS ON THE LINE AND TOM WHY NOW
WELL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'VE COME TO THE END OF THE LIST A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE THAT THE POLICE WERE INVESTIGATING THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM WERE PUBLIC OFFICIALS POLICE OFFICERS NINE POLICE OFFICERS PRISON OFFICERS WERE OFTEN INVOLVED AND THE OTHER GROUP LARGELY INVOLVED WERE PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE THE MILITARY SIDE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND ALSO PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THEM WHO WERE PROSECUTED
HELPING ARRANGE THE PAYMENTS BUT THE REAL CONTROVERSY AROUND THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN THAT A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS WE CHARGE BUT ALMOST ENTIRELY NOT CONVICTED BY JURIES THOSE ONE CONVICTION IN FRONT OF A JURY AND ONE ADMISSION OF GUILT IN COURT BY JOURNALISTS SO JUST TWO CONVICTION AND THEY WERE NOT THAT'S ACTED WITHIN AND THE POINT IS THEY WERE NOT CONVICTED BECAUSE IN THE END JURIES WEREN'T CONVINCED THAT THEY'D DONE ANYTHING WRONG
THAT'S RIGHT THEY WERE CHARGED WITH CONSPIRING TO COMMIT MISCONDUCT IN PUBLIC OFFICE NOW THE MISCONDUCT IN PUBLIC OFFICE BIT OF THAT WAS ACTUALLY COMMITTED BY THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE JOURNALISTS EFFECTIVELY WERE HELPING THEM TO DO SO BY GIVING THEM THE MONEY WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE MET HAS GIVEN A FIGURE OF AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAID THIS MORNING
BUT JURIES WEREN'T EFFECTIVELY THEY'RE INTERESTED IN CONVICTING THE JOURNALISTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN APPEAL COURT RULING WHICH SAID THAT IN GENERAL PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY BE PROSECUTED FOR THIS IF THERE HAD BEEN HOME TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND IN GENERAL IT SHOULD BE THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO WERE PROSECUTED NOT THE JOURNAL YES SO SO JUST TELL US THEN THE SMALL ONE
IF YOU IF A JOURNALIST PAYS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL FOR A BIT OF INFORMATION AND IT MIGHT BE A SERIOUS BIT OF INFORMATION A BIT OF PRISON OVERCROWDING A BIT SON HAS DEFINITELY AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IF THEY PAY THEM IS THAT A LEGAL OR B.
IF IT'S IF IT'S A PUBLIC OFFICIAL THEN I IMAGINE THAT ANY NEWS ORGANISATION IS GOING TO BE VERY WARY OF DOING SO HOWEVER WHAT IS CLEAR FROM THE RULING LAST YEAR AND THAT LAW IS CLARIFIED BY THIS THERE IS A PUBLIC INTEREST DEFENCE AND THEREFORE IT IF IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST A LID SO ISN'T IT IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION THEN THAT MATTERS
THE JUDGEMENT SAYS IF THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS SUFFICIENTLY HARMED THEN A PROSECUTION CAN FOLLOW BUT I THINK I DO OFFER FREE LEGAL ADVICE TO ME AT THIS TIME AND IT'S HUGELY AND THAT ONE OF THE DELIGHTS OF PUBLIC INFORMATION FREEDOM ACTUALLY ISN'T IT REALLY
ABSOLUTELY AND THIS INVESTIGATION AND THE PROSECUTION DECISIONS TAKEN AS PART OF IT WERE HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL AND OPPOSED BY MANY IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT OF COURSE THAT THE STORY OF M.P.S' EXPENSES WAS PAID FOR AND MUM WAS LARGELY REGARDED AS BEING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT THE LAW HAS BEEN CLARIFIED BY THIS APPEAL COURT RULING LAST YEAR AND BY THE WAY IN WHICH THIS OPERATION FUNCTIONS SO IT WOULD HAVE HAD THAT EFFECT TOM SIMON THANK YOU
TIME NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN THE OWNER OF BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS REPORTED A BIG RISE IN PROFITS AND SONS WHO WOULD NOT THANK YOU SARAH YES SIXTY FOUR PER CENT INCREASE IN PRE TAX PROFITS UP TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION POUNDS THIS IS I A G. WHICH END BRITISH AIRWAYS ALSO OWNS AIR LINGERS AND IBERIA WILLIE WALSH IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND IS ON THE LINE PRESUMABLY SOME OF THIS IS THE BENEFIT OF FALLING FUEL PRICES OR A LITTLE BIT IS THE BENEFIT OF FALLING PRICES WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH BENEFIT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN
SOME OF THE BENEFIT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE WAS OFFSET I.D. WEAKENING PYLONS IN THE WEEPING EURO AGAINST THE DOLLAR WE PAY FOR THE FUEL IN DOLLARS AND AS THE DOLLAR HIS STRENGTH AND THEREFORE SOMEBODY BENEFIT IN THE FALL OF THE OLD PRICES NOT BEEN FELLED YET AND PRESUMABLY THOUGH GOING INTO NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OFTEN AIRLINES WILL BUY THEIR FUEL IN ADVANCE IF YOU LIKE AND AS THOSE CONTRACTS EXPIRE YOU'LL GET
AN EVEN BIGGER BENEFIT IS THAT FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT IS CORRECT YES WE TYPICALLY BY FEW HAS FIRST THREE YEARS IN ADVANCE SO WE ARE STILL PAYING PRICES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I WERE PAYING PRICES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT IN EFFECT HAD BEEN LOCKED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SO WE WILL SEE SOME FURTHER BENEFIT NEXT YEAR BUT THIS IS A VERY STRONG RESULTS WERE VERY PLEASED TO REFLECTS THE STRONG PERFORMANCE IN ALL OF THE AIRLINE'S WITHIN THE GROUP AND PARTICULARLY REFLECTS CONTINUING
PROGRESS BEING MADE AT IBERIA FOLLOWING THE SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATION THAT'S TAKEN PLACE YET FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL THE BUSINESSES IN THE STABLE SORT CHUCKING THEIR CONTRIBUTION INTO THAT ENTER THE HAT TYRELL MAKING MONEY OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTION I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT HAVING A PAN EUROPEAN BUSINESS IS WHAT IMPACT BREAKS IT WOULD HAVE ON A GROUP LIKE YOURS WE GIVEN ADVICE FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES WE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS INTERNALLY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A RISK ANALYSIS
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET WHICH IS WEIGHING ON PEOPLE'S MINDS BUT OUR VIEW IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A VOTE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WILL HAVE MATERIAL IMPACT ON HER BUSINESS OH KAY AND THE OTHER THE OTHER BIG QUESTION OF COURSE FACING THE U.K. IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT OUR AIRPORT CAPACITY NOW YOU'VE SAID IN INTERVIEWS WITH ME IN THE PAST THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK A THIRD ONE WE WOULD EVER BE BUILT AT HEATHROW IF ANYTHING
HAPPENED TO CHANGE YOUR MIND I DON'T THINK SO THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO DELAY DECISION MAKING AND I THINK EVEN IF A DECISION IS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE SERIOUS VERY SERIOUS ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED IN RELATION TO THE COST OF EXPANSION HAS HEATHROW BECAUSE THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE SEEN INCLUDING THE RESEARCH DONE BY THE DAVIS COMMISSION SHOW THAT THE PROJECTED COSTS ONE AFFORDABLE AND CLEARLY THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT HURDLE THAT MUST BE OFF UPON BEFORE ANYTHING COULD BE DONE
THE STATUS QUO SUITS YOU THOUGH DOESN'T IT COS YOU'VE GOT YOUR SLOPS LOCKED UP AT HEATHROW AND THAT'S JUST FINE NO NOT REALLY IF YOU REMEMBER I DID CAMPAIGN BACK BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND NINE FOR A THIRD ONE WAY AT HEATHROW I SAID AT THE TIME AT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND A LIB DEMS CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THAT THAT THEY WERE MAKING A MISTAKE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE DECISION THAT THEY WERE TAKING BUT YOUR GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE DECISIONS AND WE HAVE TO RUN A BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE DECISIONS
WE HAD ASKED FOR THIS THIRD RUNWAY PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT PREPARED TO WRITE ABOUT THEIR BLANK CHEQUE AND THE VERY FINAL THOUGHT YOU OFTEN SAID YOU RETIRE AT FIFTY FIVE YOU'RE FIFTY FOUR NOW IT'S HER BIRTHDAY IN OCTOBER IS THIS THE LAST ONES AT LAST WE CAN SEE BUT I'D STILL BE FIFTY FIVE UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIFTY SIX BIRTHDAY SO THERE'S STILL TIME BASIC CLUE O.K. WELL WELSH CHIEF EXECUTIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU
SO NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN HELP FROM CHARLES MOORE JOURNALIST AND BIOGRAPHER OF MARGARET THATCHER AT THIS TIME A FORTNIGHT AGO AND HE TOLD US IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION LET'S HEAR AN EQUALLY PASSIONATE AND CLOSELY ARGUED CASE FOR STAYING IN THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST AND HIM INTO MEADOWS ARGUES THAT THE BIGGEST SINGLE ISSUE FOR HER AT STAKE ON POLLING DAY IS ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET
IF YOU'RE PAYING TO SCRATCH SO HERE WE ARE PICKING THE ORDERS OUT THIS WEEK TO A EUROPEAN WHOLESALE
WIRES ARE SHOWING ME ROUND THEIR HEADQUARTERS A BRIT ART SHROPSHIRE FIRM THAT MANUFACTURES THEMSELVES PARTS FOR LANDROVER VEHICLES EVERYTHING FROM HEADLIGHTS ARE SEATS PART IS THE BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN CRAVEN ARMS A SMALL TOWN A COUPLE OF MILES FROM THE VILLAGE WHERE I GREW UP I'VE COME HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT BRECHT'S IT WOULD MEAN TO A PLACE THAT FOR ME IS THE HEART OF ENGLISH
POSSIBLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CUSTOMERS AWAY OUR OWN LAWYERS RUNNING TO FRANCE BELGIUM HOLLAND AND GERMANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TALK A LOT ABOUT THE BURDEN OF RED TAPE FROM BRUSSELS DO YOU FIND NEW REGULATIONS ARE A PROBLEM FOR YOU NO NOT REALLY
E.U. REGULATIONS BUT NORMALLY THOSE ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE U.K. ANYWAY A LOT OF IT IS OVER
HEALTH AND SAFETY IS NOT DIRECTED BY
MOMENT TRANSACTING BUSINESS IN YOUR BIT PAINLESS WE CAN DO IT INSTANTLY IF WE ARE LOOKING AT MIDDLE AGED OR FARIS IT IS A MORE DIFFICULT TRANSACTION
BEING A MEMBER OF THE E.U. MEANS BRITAIN'S PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET THAT MEANS BRITISH FIRMS HAVE TO FOLLOW REGULATIONS THERE ARE JOINTLY AGREED IN BRUSSELS BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT FIRMS LIKE BRICK PART CAN SELL THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES ANYWHERE IN THE E.U. WITHOUT FACING TARIFFS ALL RESTRICTIONS THAT MARKET HOME TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE IS THE BIGGEST AND RICHEST IN THE WORLD
ALMOST HALF THIS COUNTRY'S EXPORT TO GO THEY'RE HAVING ACCESS TO IT ALSO ATTRACTS COMPANIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO BRITAIN WE GET MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. BRITAIN WOULD BE FREER TO SET ITS OWN RULES BUT WE MIGHT ALSO LOSE ACCESS TO THAT SINGLE MARKET FOR ME UNDERSTANDING THOSE TRADE OFFS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES IS THE CRUCIAL QUESTION IN DECIDING WHETHER BRECK'S IT MAKES SENSE
WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK LEAVING EUROPEAN UNION WOULD HAVE ON BRICK PART DEFINITELY WAS A FEAR THAT IF WE ARE LOSING BUSINESS COS WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE ANY MORE THEY COULD IMPACT ON FUTURE
OR BRICK PART ANOTHER EXPORTERS LIKE IT THE PROSPECT OF BRECHT'S IT IS A WORRYING ONE BUT WHAT ABOUT INVESTORS INTO BRITAIN AND OTHER TEAM IS EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE SCENT AND THEY'RE BANKING GROUP I ASKED HER WHAT SHE THINKS THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE FOR A BRITAIN THAT'S NO LONGER IN THE E.U.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO DECIDE BUT I AM VERY CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT CLEAR BUT THE RISKS AND THE COSTS ARE QUITE SO WE'RE A WORSE OFF WITH BRITAIN LEAVING THE ALL OF US AND IF BRITAIN WE WOULD BE GOING THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS RENEGOTIATION OF TREATIES WITH TWENTY FIVE COUNTRIES PLUS ALL THOSE REGIONS IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE E.U. ADDING UNCERTAINTY MEANS LESS INVESTMENT LESS INVESTMENT MEANS LESS JOBS WOULD I DON'T DARE HAVE EXPANDED SO MUCH IN BRITAIN IF IT HAD NOT BEEN A MEMBER OF THE
A THEORETICAL QUESTION WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT WE DID DECIDE TO INVEST IN THE LARGE ECONOMY THAT WAS PART OF EUROPE WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT IS NOT A SINGLE MARKET AS IT IS TODAY IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO A BADLY FOR US WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSELY LINKED TO THE U.K. ECONOMY WE'VE INVESTED SIXTEEN BILLION POUNDS WE WANT THE BEST THING FOR A TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND TEAMS IN THE U.K. AND A TWENTY FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS I DO THINK OUR CUSTOMERS ARE BETTER OFF IN EUROPE AND I ALSO THINK ACTUALLY EUROPE
HE'S BETTER OFF WITH BRITAIN INSIDE IT AND HAVE OUR TEENS CONCERNED SOUND REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO PAUL MYERS IS THAT BRICK PART ARE THEY RIGHT TO BE SO WORRIED I PUT THAT QUESTION TO UKIP M.P. DOUGLAS CARSWELL WHO WOULD LIKE BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE E.U. MANY FIRMS AND INVESTORS RECOGNISED THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUT THEY RECOGNISE THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN A POLITICAL UNION TO TRADE IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WOULD HAVE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS NOT JUST WITH NORTH AMERICA NOT JUST WITH CHINA I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THEM WITH THE WIDER WORLD
BY BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'RE PREVENTING US FROM GETTING THESE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH PREVENTING BRITAIN FROM TAKING PART IN THAT PROSPERITY THAT IS LIFTING SO MANY COUNTRIES ROUND THE WORLD OUT OF POVERTY WE HAVE TIED OURSELVES IN WITH THE WORLD'S ONLY DECLINING TRADE BLOCK AND WE'RE LEFT REPRESENTED BY ONE TWENTY EIGHTH OF A EUROCRATS IN BRUSSELS IT'S NO WAY TO DO BUSINESS
THAT WAS DOUGLAS CARSWELL RATHER OPTIMISTIC TAKE BUT IS IT REALISTIC TIME TO TURN TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY HOW THE E. YOU NEGOTIATE TRADE DEALS PETER MANDELSON WAS THE E. USE TRADE COMMISSIONER FROM TWO THOUSAND FORTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
WE WOULD BE FREE TO NEGOTIATE BUT WHO'S GOING TO WANT TO NEGOTIATE WITH US I MEAN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS THEY ARE NOT AS EASY AS FALLING OFF A LOG I CAN ASSURE YOU PEOPLE HAVE MANY PRIORITIES MANY OTHER DEMANDS THEY LOOK ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW WHY WHEN BRITAIN CHOOSES TO OPT OUT OF THE EUROPEAN
WOULD WE HAVE CHINA OR INDIA OR BRAZIL OR ANYONE ELSE QUEUING UP WITH THEY HAVE EUROPE TO DEEPEN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEY HAD MANY OTHER LARGER EMERGING FAST GROWING ECONOMIES I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH BRICK
BUT BY THE TIME THEY GOT ROUND TO NEGOTIATING WITH US IT WOULD BE DECADES
IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS WHAT NORWAY OR SWITZERLAND HAVE WE'RE NEVER CAME TO GET DIFFERENT OR BETTER IF NOT ALWAYS DEAL IS THE BEST ON OFFER WHAT EXACTLY DOES IT IMPLY NORWAY HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE E.U. MARKET BUT IT ALSO HAS TO OBSERVE ALL THE SINGLE MARKETS REGULATIONS WITHOUT HAVING ANY SAY IN WRITING THEM IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES ABOUT AS MUCH MONEY TO THE E.U. PER PERSON AS BRITAIN
AND HAS TO ALLOW FREE IMMIGRATION FOR E.U. CITIZENS HERE'S THE NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER UNDERSELL BUG WOULD BRITAIN LIKE TO JUST ADAPT TO BRUSSELS WITHOUT HAVING A SAY WHICH WE ARE DOING WE CAN PROTEST WE CAN SAY THAT THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE BUT IN THE END
WE DO IT ADAPT TO ALL OF THOSE WERE ALSO A REGULATION THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE SINGLE MARKET WE HAVE OUR OWN FARM POLICY WE HAVE AUNT FISHERY POLICIES WHICH YOURS ARE BIG SOME GLAMOROUS TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE THEIR TARIFFS ON SUMMER OR EXPORTS OF FISHERIES TO US EUROPEAN MARKET DOES BRITAIN REALLY THINK THAT THEY CAN ACCEPT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WAS IN FACT THE SIZE FROM THE LAW SAID YOU JUST HAVE TO ADAPT TO WE DO
FOR ME A FEW THINGS ARE CLEAR AT A MINIMUM A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WILL CAUSE A HUGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTY THAT WILL HURT INVESTMENT AND JOBS AND THAT COULD LAST FOR YEARS IN THE LONG RUN IF WE WANT TO KEEP ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WE WILL HAVE TO APPLY THE E. USE RULES WE WILL HAVE TO PAY INTO THE E.U. BUDGET AND WE WILL HAVE TO ALLOW MIGRATION FROM THE REST OF THE E.U.
IF WE WANT TO SET UP OUR OWN RULES WE WON'T HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE IDEA THAT WE CAN QUICKLY AND EASILY FIND ALTERNATIVE MARKET IS NONSENSE WE MIGHT HAVE MORE SOVEREIGNTY OUTSIDE THE E.U. BUT WE WILL PAY AN ECONOMIC PRICE AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW HIGH THAT PRICE WILL BE THAT'S WHY I THINK BRITAIN SHOULD STAY IN
IS THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST WILL TALK TO HER AT ABOUT TWENTY TO NINE TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW GARY'S JOINED US WITH SOME SPORTS NEWS GAG SERRA JUSTIN GOOD MORNING MANCHESTER UNITED SPURS AND LIVERPOOL ARE ALL THROUGH TO THE LAST SIXTEEN OF THE EUROPA LEAGUE IN THE DRAWER FOR THE NEXT STAGE WILL BE MADE A LITTLE LATER TODAY S'POSE COMPLETED

NEW FIGURES SHOW THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS FOR PEOPLE TRAFFICKING OFFENCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES HAS REACHED A RECORD LEVEL ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED BETWEEN APRIL IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR FOR SHORT OF THE TOTAL FOR THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS
VOTERS IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC OR GOING TO THE POLLS IN A GENERAL ELECTION FIVE YEARS AGO THE CENTRE RIGHT FEENA GAYLE WON THE MOST SEATS IT'S GOVERNED SINCE THEN IN COALITION WITH LABOUR
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND THE BANK WE ALL OWN HUH AT LEAST THREE QUARTERS OF IT HAS JUST REPORTED A LOSS OF ONE POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS
THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE YEAR BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN LOSSES WERE THREE AND A HALF BILLION POUND SIMON JACK IS HERE IT IS THE EIGHTH YEAR OF LOSSES AT UP YES I'M AFRAID SO ANDY SAY WE ONLY LOST NEARLY TWO BILLION POUNDS IT'S A BANK THAT CONTINUES TO PAY FOR THE SINS OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS ON I MEAN THIS IS BANK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE FOUR AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS BUT WHEN YOU ADD IN THREE POINT SIX BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF CONDUCT AND LITIGATION FINDS THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE
P.P.I. THEY PUT TWO BILLION POUNDS AGAINST SETTLING MORTGAGE LITIGATION IN THE U.S. IF YOU ADD ON TO THAT TWO POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS OF RESTRUCTURING COSTS THAT MEANS GETTING OUT HER BUSINESSES SOMETIMES AT A LOSS THAT FOUR AND A HALF BILLION POUND PROFIT TURNS IN TO A TWO BILLION POUND LOSS AT ALL OF THAT MEANS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO SELL
INDEED NOW THE GOVERNMENT SOLD SIX PER CENT A FEW MONTHS AGO WE WANTED TO SELL SOME MIGHT SOLD AT A LOSS THE IDEAS THEY WILL GET RID OF IT BIT BY BIT AND EVENTUALLY YOU'D MAKE A PROFIT BUT IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE HAD TO ABANDON SELLING LLOYD'S LLOYD STEAK AND THAT'S A BANK WITH MAKING PLENTY OF PROFIT SO WE ARE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR THIS WOULD BE OWNING THIS BANK FOR MANY YEARS TO COME I SUSPECT WE'LL SEE LOSSES IN THE NEXT ANTH POSSIBLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR AS WELL
SIMON THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT A LITTLE EARLY THIS MORNING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF R.B.S. WAS MCEWAN TOLD ME ABOUT THE RESULTS
LOOK I SEE THIS IS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS FOR THE SPEC WITH WE'VE GOT A VERY VERY GOOD CALL FRANCHISE HERE A NUMBER OF THEM AND THE BANK IT'S GETTING MUCH MUCH STRONGER IT'S A SIMPLER BANK IN ONE THAT WAS FOCUSED BECK ON THE CUSTOMERS
AND UNFORTUNATELY UNDERLYING LOSS DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON ON THE SPANK WATCHERS MESS OF IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS ALL SPHERES THE HEADLINE FIGURES ONE POINT NINE BILLION PRE TAX LOSS IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION PRE TAX LOSS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING FIGURES YOU IT'S FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION COMPARED WITH SIX BILLION IT'S GETTING WORSE
TONIGHT'S A DIFFERENT BANK WE SAID WE ASTRID USED FAKE A SPECK ON THE U.K. AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND WE'VE SOLD OFF A LOT OF LOT OF THEIR BUSINESSES OFFSHORE BUT OF COURSE YOUR EARNINGS WILL COME DOWN OFF THAT AND ALSO LAST YEAR THERE WAS SOME SOME GAINS OUT OF SALES OF ASSETS THAT WE DID SELL SO THE NUMBERS ARE GOOD OUR UNDERLYING RETURN ON EQUITY YEARS UP OVER LAST YOUR VEHICLE FRANCHISES SO WE'RE PLEASED WITH THE RESULT ARE YOU BEING SQUEEZED BY LOW INTEREST RATES
LOW INTEREST RATES TO HIT BANKS SAYING DO IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT INTEREST RATES WILL STAY LOWER FOR MUCH LONGER NOW THE U.K. AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND ACTUALLY STOVE QUITE STRONG ECONOMIES AND WE'RE SEEING THAT COMING THROUGH WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AT THIS STORE BORROWING WELL
AND THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE BUT ARE YOU ARE SEEING A SLOWING DOWN AND A NUMBER OF ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD AND LOWER INTEREST RATES DO HIT THAT HAD BAGS BUT THAT JUST MEANS YOU NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON THE CUSTOMERS AND ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR COST BASE IS UNDER CONTROL AND YOU WOULD SAY IT IS NOW WHICH TO A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND THEN THEY COST BASE OF THIS BUSINESS STORM MUCH TOO HIGH FOR THE SHAPE OF THE BUSINESS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
AS OF SOUP WE WANT TO BE A U.K. REPUBLIC OF IRELAND BUSINESS VERY STRONG IN BUSINESS BANKING WE ARE THE LARGEST BUSINESS BEG THAT IS GROWING WITH BECKHAM TO THE U.K. IN REPUBLIC THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUSES AND DOING A VERY GOOD JOB THERE AND OF COURSE THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY IS WHAT SEVENTY THREE PER CENT STILL OWNED BY THE TAXPAYER AND THEN THERE IS THIS COMMITMENT TO GET RID OF HUGE AMOUNT OF THAT BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT WE'RE SO FAR AWAY FROM ANY MORSE THAT SHARES BEING ABLE TO BE SOLD
IT'S INTERESTING LOOK MAC IT IS YOU'VE SEEN THEM THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN VERY TURBULENT PRICED OF BANKS HAVE COME DOWN QUITE DRAMATICALLY THAT TINS AROUND AS WELL NOT PREDICTING WIN THAT WILL BE BUT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING HER QUICKLY MARKETS TO TURN AROUND THE SENTIMENT
MY JOB IS JUST TO MAKE THIS A MUCH BIGGER BANKS SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WYNANT MONSTER SALE KEN SO THEIR PROGRESS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN MADE THIS YEAR AS WE SAID LAST YEAR OH KAY BUT CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SENSE OF THE TIMESCALE YOU RECKON BECAUSE WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE THE I THINK THE SHARE PRICE WHAT HALF WHAT IT WAS WHEN THE BANK WAS BAILED OUT AND THERE'S IT'S WHAT TWENTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF SHARES THAT NEED TO BE OFFLOADED THIS PARLIAMENT
LOOK AT IT IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT IT'S FOR THEM TO TAKE THE TIMING THAT MADE THE START OF THAT WHICH I THINK WAS QUITE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO SAY TO PEOPLE WE WE DO WANT TO SELL HERE BUT I THINK THEY'LL HAVE TO MEASURE IT WHAT'S THE BEST TIME TO GET THE BEST VEGGIE FOR IT AS WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE FOR YOU IF THOSE SHARES WERE OWNED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR LOOK I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENCE I ALWAYS THINK THE BANKS SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS
RATHER THAN WITH GOVERNMENTS BUT
AT THE MOMENT HE'S BEEN HER GOOD HAVING THE GOVERNMENT AS A SHAREHOLDER WHILE WE'VE MADE A MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OF THE SPENT OH KAY YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A VERY POSITIVE CASE OF THE SITUATION FOR A S. BUT YOU LOOK AT IT COMPARED WITH LLOYDS FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN A DIVIDEND PAYOUT OF TWO BILLION AND MADE A PROFIT OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION
YOU CAN LOOK BACK TO THE STARTING POINTS THIS WAS THE LARGEST BANK IN THE WORLD IT WAS IN FIFTY SEVEN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE MADE THE DETERMINATION THE SPEECH TO BE BACK HERE IN THE U.K. AND THE REPUBLICAN WILL OPERATE OFFSHORE WHERE A CORPORATES MADE HER SO IT WAS A DIFFERENT STARTING POINT
AND I THINK WE ARE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BEHIND VOIDS FROM GETTING BACK TO THEIR POSITION BUT VERY VERY GOOD PROGRESS BEING MADE AND IT WAS GOING TO SAY GO IT'S GETTING BECKONED TO PAYING A DIVIDEND THAT RESPIRATION AS WELL THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING FOR FOR THE PUBLIC OF OF THE U.K. AND TO DO THAT WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO NEXT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST OFF WE HAVE STILL GOT A NUMBER OF CONDUCT MITIGATION ISSUES THE LARGEST OF THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WE NEED TO SEE IT AT FORTY THAT'S NOT THAT GIFT TIMEWISE
WE NEED TO SELL OFF WILLIAMS AND GLEN BUTCHERS THE BRANCH NETWORK THAT WAS COMMITTED TO SELLING BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO WE NEED TO IN WE NEED TO SHOW HER TRACK RECORD THAT WE HAVE GOT A VERY GOOD BAKE UNDERNEATH ALL OF THE HEADLINE NOISE OF SOME WEIRD AND WE'RE CERTAINLY DOING THAT
AT WHAT STAGE DO YOU THINK WE WILL WE WILL BE BACK AT A POINT WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T THINKING OF A BSL ARE SORT OF POSSIBLY A ZOMBIE INSTITUTION AND ACTUALLY A SORT OF A SOLID GOOD WORKING BANK
I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT NOW YOU STARTING TO SEE A RECORD OF THOSE GOING UP WE'RE SEEING OUR BALANCE SHEET GROWING YOU SEEING THE BRAIN STARTING TO PERFORM BEATER FOR CUSTOMERS AND NECK WAIST FOR EXAMPLE HAS ITS HIGHEST CUSTOMER SERVICE SCORES FOR ALL OF TIME THAT WE CAN REMEMBER WE ARE ON THE GROUND
DO IT I THINK A VERY GOOD JOB FOR CUSTOMERS NOT ENTIRELY IT BUT CERTAINLY ON A GOOD PATH STORE I DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH WORK WE'VE GOT TO GET TO WHERE EMISSION OF BEING NUMBER ONE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TRUST CHRISSIE BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT

HER SISTER WAS CALLED GABRIEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE NAMES AND WHO'S THAT WAS CALLED ALL BRIE WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE OF TOO MUCH ALREADY VALENTINE COMING PROFESSOR VALENTINE CUNNINGHAM FROM CORPUS CHRISTI OXFORD THANK
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS RABBI LORD SACKS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING FOR ME THE MOST MAGICAL MOMENT IN THIS WEEK'S NEWS WAS THE SIDE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIX YEAR OLD WOMAN VIRGINIA LAUREN
DANCING WITH BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE THERE SHE WAS RADIANT WITH EXCITEMENT LIKE A CHILD THRILLED TO BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE THRILLED IN AMERICAN BLACK HISTORY MONTH TO BE HOLDING HANDS WITH A BLACK PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY AFTER ALL THAT HISTORY OF SLAVERY AND SUFFERING IT WAS GLORIOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT SO AS WELL BECAUSE SIXTY MILLION HAVE WATCHED THE VIDEO HOW DO YOU GET TO BE THAT OLD AND STAYED THERE
THE BEST ANSWER I KNOW IS AT THE END OF THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT MOSES THAT AT THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HIS EYE WAS DEMONS AND HIS NATURAL ENERGY UNABATED I USED TO THINK THAT THESE WERE JUST TWO DESCRIPTIONS UNTIL I REALISED THAT THE FIRST WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SECOND
WHY WAS HIS ENERGY UNABATED BECAUSE I WAS UNDIMMED BECAUSE HE NEVER LOST THE IDEALS OF HIS YOUTH HIS FAITH INJUSTICE AND HIS BELIEF THAT HIS PEOPLE COULD EMERGE FROM SLAVERY AND INSPIRED BY GOD WRITE ITS OWN CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
AND DESPITE ALL THE SETBACKS DESPITE THE FACT THE JOURNEY THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN DAYS TOOK DECADES HE NEVER BECAME CYNICAL OR DISILLUSIONED NEVER LOST HOPE NEVER STOP JOURNEYING TOWARD THE PROMISED LAND
A FEW MONTHS AGO LORD WIDEN FELLED DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY SIX HE TOO STAYED ACTIVE ALMOST TO THE VERY END WITH PLANS TO BRING PEACE TO TROUBLE PARTS OF THE WORLD ON HIS NINETY SECOND BIRTHDAY HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY A JOURNALIST WHO SAID IN THEIR NINETIES MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT SLOWING DOWN
YOU SEEM TO BE SPEEDING UP WHY IS THAT HE REPLIED WHEN YOU GET TO BE NINETY TWO YOU SAW THE SEA THE DOOR BEGINNING TO CLOSE AND I'VE SO MUCH TO DO BEFORE IT CLOSES THAT THE OLDER I GET THE HARDER I HAVE TO WORK THAT'S HOW HE STAYED YOUNG
IT ISN'T ALWAYS POSSIBLE WE GET FRAIL THE BODY AGES THE MIND FADES BUT WHILE WE CAN LET'S LIVE THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TO THE FULL WE ARE AS YOUNG AS OUR IDEALS NEVER LOSE FAITH NEVER LOSE HOPE NEVER CLOSE YOUR MIND TO WONDER WHEN THE PRESIDENT ASKED VIRGINIA MACLAURIN FOR THE SECRET OF BEING ABLE TO DANCE AT ONE HUNDRED SIX SHE DIDN'T REPLY SHE DANCED
JUST KEEP MOVING SAID THE FIRST LADY WITH A SMILE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH A RABBI LORD SACKS THE TIME TEN TO EIGHT THE FORMER LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY MICHAEL HOWARD NOW LORD HOWARD WILL BE CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
HE THINKS A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD ALLOW US TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER DEAL MY LORD HOWARD JOINS US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING SIR WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE AFTER ALL DAVID CAMERON THE MAN WHO WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE TWENTY SEVEN OTHER LEADERS IN THE E.U. FOR HOURS THROUGH THE NIGHT A NEGOTIATING THIS DEAL SAYS THAT'S FOR THE
WELL IT MAY NOT HAPPEN I CAN'T OBVIOUSLY GUARANTEED THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN BUT THE THINGS THAT
REALLY MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT WE COULD THRIVE ON OUR OWN AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THE STRONGEST MILITARY POWER IN EUROPE THE FACT THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE OUR TRADITIONS ARE MORE DEEP ROOTED AND THOSE OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE VERY FACT THAT MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO THRIVE ON OUR OWN MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT WE WOULD BE SORELY MISSED IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE IN ADDITION IT SECOND BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR
AND SO I THINK THAT IF THEY WERE REALLY FACED WITH A BRITISH THING TO LEAVE THEY WOULD THINK AGAIN BUT I COULD BE WRONG AND IF I'M WRONG IT WOULD JUST MEAN THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY REFUSED TO FACE UP TO THE NEED FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL AND FAR REACHING REFORM THAT DAVID CAMERON SET OUT TO ACHIEVE AND IF THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO REFORM I THINK WE'RE BETTER RIGHT O. K. SO YOU'RE SO CAMPAIGNING ON THAT BASIS YOU WOULD BE HAPPY THAT IF BRITAIN WERE OUT WE WOULD
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET OH LOOK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ARE THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE A MARKET THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO AND LOOK YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE IT FROM ME
THIS IS WHAT JACQUES DE LAW SAID THE GREAT ARCH PROFIT OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION HE SAID IF THE BRITISH CAN'T SUPPORT THE TREND TOWARDS MORE INTEGRATION IN EUROPE WE CAN NEVERTHELESS REMAINED FRIENDS BUT ON A DIFFERENT BASIS I COULD IMAGINE A FORM SUCH AS A EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA OR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT
THAT'S COMES JACKIE LAW AND IT OBVIOUSLY THE CASE THE GERMANS I'LL GET HER WANT TO CARRY ON SELLING THEIR B.M.W.S AND THEY'RE OUT IS TO US
THE FRENCH ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WANTED TO WANT TO SELL THEIR WINE TO US SO IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S INTEREST TO HAVE BEN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ENABLE EACH OF US TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE OTHERS MARC AND EVERY OTHER COUNTRY THAT HAS THAT SORT OF AGREEMENT HAS TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OR ACCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT NOW THOSE THINGS THAT DO YOU SAY WELL NO WE WON'T HAVE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DO YOUR TALKING ABOUT NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND NORWAY IS A COUNTRY OF FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WE ARE A COUNTRY OF SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE
WE WON'T HAVE A NORWEGIAN STYLE AGREEMENT WITH THE E.U. WE HAVE A BRITISH AGREEMENT WITH THE E.U. WE NEED A BIT OF SELF BELIEF A NATIONAL SELF CONFIDENCE WERE A GREAT COUNTRY WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHICH EVERYBODY WANTS ACCESS TO OUR MARKET WE WON'T BE SUPPLICANTS
WE WILL HAVE A SENSIBLE AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH WOULD GIVE THEIR COUNTRIES ACCESS TO A MARKET AND WOULD GIVE US ACCESS TO THEIRS YOU ARE THOUGH OF COURSE NEGOTIATING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO LIMIT ANY CONTAGION WHO ARE NOT WANTING OTHERS TO FOLLOW AND
ON THOSE GROUNDS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE BRITAIN EVERYTHING IT WANTS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GIVING BRITAIN EVERYTHING IT WANTS I THINK THAT THAT IF THEY WERE PREPARED TO CONTEMPLATE THEY MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH EVERY MEMBER STATE HAD ROOM TO BREATHE I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD NOT JUST FOR BRITAIN BUT GOOD FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK IT WOULD PUT IT ON A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE BASIS IT COULD EVEN MAKE THE EUROPEAN UNION A MODEL FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHO WANT TO GROUP TOGETHER AND CO OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER
IT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANT THAT OF ALL THE OTHER GROUPINGS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD NONE HAS SOUGHT TO COPY THE MODEL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE IT'S AN OUTDATED MOTTO
IT IN'T IT TRIES TO IMPOSE A RIGID STRAIT JACKET OF UNIFORMITY ON COUNTRIES AS DIFFERENT AS FINLAND AND GREASE AND THAT'S WHY IT IS A A FLAWED AND FAILING PROJECT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD IMPLEMENT ARTICLE FIFTY STRAIGHT AWAY AFTER A REFERENDUM I LOOK START THE PRO SHIT BUT THE PROCESSED TO LEAVE DO YOU THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE
I'M SID I WOULD SUGGEST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH I THINK IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE I THINK THE SENSIBLE THING TO DO WOULD BE TO WAIT A SHORT PERIOD PERHAPS A MONTH OR SO TO GIVE OUR PARTNERS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER THEIR POSITION
I THINK IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT DURING THAT MONTH THEY WOULD SAY LET'S TALK SOME MORE LET'S SEE IF WE CAN REACH A DIFFERENT AGREEMENT AND PERHAPS YOU COULD HAVE A SECOND REFERENDUM IF AFTER A MONTH OR SO THEY DON'T THEN ARTICLE FIFTY WOULD HAVE TO BE TRIGGERED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS TO LEAVE WOULD BEGIN
IF YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT WHICH IS HER LEAVE VOTE
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE WAS YOUR PROTEGE DAVID CAMERON WOULD WE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE TO RESIGN AND I WONDER IF YOU THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S JUST A PRICE WORTH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN AT ALL LOOK
IF WE VOTED TO LEAVE THE LAST THING THE COUNTRY WOULD WANT IS TO BE FOR GOVERNMENT TO BE DISTRACTED BY ANOTHER LEADERSHIP CONTEST IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO A PRIME MINISTER WHO HAS FAILED IN HIS DONATION TO THE E.U. WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE STAYING ON I AM ABSOLUTELY CONTINENT THAT DAVID CAMERON COULD STAY ON I THINK HE SHOULD STAY ON
I THINK HE WOULD ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF THE COUNTRY IF WE VOTED TO LEAVE IF THEY WERE TO BE A SECOND NEGOTIATION WITH A VIEW TO A DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT I'D BE VERY HAPPY FOR HIM TO BE IN CHARGE OF IT AND IF WE DO HAVE TO NEGOTIATE DEPARTURE I'D BE HAPPY FOR HIM TO NEGOTIATE THAT TOO
AN EARLIER CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER RATHER FAMOUSLY REFERRED TO YOU AS HE BASTARD OVER YOUR VIEWS ON THE EURO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN DOUBT ACTUALLY WET AS TO WHETHER I WAS ONE OF THEM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO GET AT THE END OF MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE WHETHER THE CURRENT PRIME MINISTER MIGHT BE USING THE SAME PHRASING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HIM THAT IS SOMETHING YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM ABOUT
MICHAEL HOWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT CHRIS WALKS LIKE THAT THAT'S LIKE JUSTIN YES THE AIR'S TURNED BLUE JUST FOR A MOMENT IS ALSO TURN QUITE COLD ACROSS THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND WE'VE GOT TEMPERATURES DOWN BELOW FREEZING THIS MORNING BUT WHERE IN THE SUNSHINE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS TODAY IS GOING TO BE A MUCH CLOUDIER DAY BUT THERE WILL BE A FEW BREAKS IN THE CLOUD TO ALLOW A FEW LIMITED BRIGHT OR SUNNY SPELLS

ARE GOING TO PUBS AND CLUBS I WAS NOT DOING THAT I WON'T WORK YOU KNOW I DON'T YOU YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING IT WOULD HATE WHAT WE WORKED BECAUSE THE OFFICES BUT PREPARED VERY TINY YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT HE WAS BEING SPOKEN TO FROM TIME TO TIME AND HE WOULD PLAY EVERY OVER MANY YEARS HE WAS HEAD NO WAY BECAUSE YOU WERE IN A MEETING WEREN'T YOU WITH HER AND THE CONTROLLER AT THE TIME DEREK CHINNERY SAT HIM DOWN AND ACTUALLY ASKED HIM MISS THESE RUMOURS WERE TRUE
DAME JANET SMITH SAID TED BESTON SAVANTS PRODUCER AT THE TIME PROVIDED A YOUNG WOMAN FOR THE D.J. DID YOU SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF THIS
SO YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TED BESTON AND TRAVEL
I WAS DOIN DAVIES OF RADIO ONE TALKING TO SEE MC ATTACH THE OTHER ISSUE OF COURSE IS WHETHER THE CULTURE NOW HAS CHANGED AS THE B. B. C. CLAIMS NOT JUST IN TERMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BUT ALSO WHISTLEBLOWING WHY FOR INSTANCE DID THE NEWSNIGHT JOURNALISTS WHO TRYING TO EXPOSE SEVERAL LEAVE THE B. B. C. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE BROADCASTER ANDY KERSHAW WHO GAVE EVIDENCE IN THE CHAINED DANITES MESH SMITH INQUIRY HAD ALSO WORKED AT RADIO ONE AT THE SAME TIME AS JIMMY SAVILE AND WE STARTED WITH WHAT HE KNEW
IT WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST IN THAT IN THE TIME I WAS AT RADIO ONE AND IN THOSE YEARS IN WHICH I OVERLAPPED WITH JIMMY SADDLE WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX HE IS THERE THERE WERE RUMOURS ABOUT CY'S ENTHUSIASM FOR
SEX WITH UNDERAGE GIRLS WHICH WERE NOT JUST PERSISTENT BOOK CON SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT I CALL A RESERVOIR OF RUMOUR ABOUT HIM AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHEN I JOINED RADIO ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WAS THAT
MY PRODUCER THE GREAT JOHN WALTERS WHO I SHARED WITH JOHN PEEL IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME TO DO IT KEEP YOUR DISTANCE FROM SAINT VALISE A REALLY NASTY PIECE OF WORK AND I TOLD THEN JANET'S BEEN ON MANY OF THE STORIES THAT CIRCULATED AND
I DID WHAT I COULD AT THE ONLY THINK I COULD DO SOMEBODY WORKED ON THE SHOP FLOOR AT RADIO ONE AND NOT IN A MANAGEMENT POSITION WAS JUST TO KEEP MY DISTANCE FROM HIM COULD YOU HAVE MADE A FORMAL COMPLAINT THERE AND SAID I'VE HEARD THINGS THAT ARE SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE FOLLOWED UP BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT WELL YOU SEE THE PROBLEM IS IT WAS ALL HEARSAY IT WAS RUMOUR IT WAS STORIES IT WAS REPUTATION AND HE CAN'T REALLY CAUGHT IN THE POLICE OR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND SAY I'VE HEARD THAT
JIMMY SADDLES A CHILD MOLESTER OR WAS HE WANTED TO CALL HIM BECAUSE HE'D SO WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT BUT THAT'S THE POINT SHE'S MAKING THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN IN HER REPORT THIS WAS SO UPSET THE LAWYERS BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU READ WHAT SHE SAYS SHE SAYS AGAIN AND AGAIN THESE COMPLAINTS DID NOT REACH MANAGEMENT LEVEL AT THE B.B.C. WELL THAT'S A RATHER CUTE CONCLUSION IF I'VE GOT HIS DRILL ISN'T IT
HOW COULD PEOPLE HAVE WORKED WITHIN THE B. B. C. ONE LET'S PUT IT ANOTHER WAY DAME JANET HE'S ASKING US TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT AT THE B.B.C. AND A BOTTLE OF THOSE IN THE LOFTIER POSITIONS OF MANAGEMENT HAD NOT HEARD THE PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT RUMOURS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WHO WORKED IN THE B. B. C.
BUT ON THE SHOP FLOOR AT HEARD FOR YEARS AND NOT JUST WITHIN THE B. B. C. JOSIE YOU KNOW THE SADDLE ROOM ROSE
EVERYBODY WHO WORKED IN THE WIDER MEDIA AS WELL AND THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS HAD HEARD THE RUMOURS ABOUT JIMMY SAVILE AND FOR ANYONE TO CLAIM THAT THE THAT THE HAVEN'T HEARD THOSE RUMOURS AT THE TIME WELL
A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS I THINK DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CULTURE HAS CHANGED I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE THAT ALLOWED SADDLE TO OPERATE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CULTURE THAT ALLOWS WHISTLE BLOWING AND OPENNESS AND I'M THINKING PARTICULARLY OF THE FACT THAT LIZ MCCAIN UM AARON JONES OR TWO JOURNALISTS ON NEWSNIGHT ORIGINALLY BROKE THE STORY I WANTED TO BREAK THE STORY OF JIMMY SAVILE THAT REPORT OF COURSE WAS DROP THE BOTH OF THEM SAY THEY WERE FORCED OUT OF THE B. DO YOU DO YOU DID DO YOU THINK THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANISATION
I COULDN'T SAY REALLY ACCURATELY BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THERE DAY IN DAY OUT AT A CENTRE OPERATE MOST THE TIME FROM HOME ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S IT WAS AT THE TIME
I THOUGHT APPALLING THAT THE SADDLE INVESTIGATION BY NEWSNIGHT WAS WAS SCRAPPED AND IT HAD A WHIFF OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT STILL TRYING TO
COVER THEIR TRACKS OVER OVER SEVERAL AS LATE AS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND IT'S EMERGED THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS HARD BETWEEN THE HEAD OF NEWS AT THE TIME AND MARK THOMPSON THE OUTGOING DIRECTOR GENERAL AND
THOMPSON APPARENTLY WAS HORRIFIED TO LEARN OF THE NEWSNIGHT INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT ONE BUT TWO TRIBUTE PROGRAMMES TO JIMMY SEVERAL IN PREPARATION AT THE TIME SO
SO SCRAP IN THOSE TWO TRIBUTE PROGRAMMES THE SCRAP NEWSNIGHT AND ALL THE EDITS HER OUT TO DRY AND WAS MAKIN ENDED UP LEAVING THE B.B.C. DO YOU DO YOU THINK THE B. B. C. ROSE LIZ MCKENNA MAN JAMES WEREN'T INTERVIEWED BY DAME JANET DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BEAMED YOU DO YOU DO YOU THINK THE B.B.C. SHOULD NOW SAY MORE ABOUT THEIR POSSESSION I'VE GOT OF COURSE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED BY DAME JANET SMITH BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY EXPLAINED WHY THAT NEWSNIGHT JIMMY SAVILE INVESTIGATION WASN'T SCREENED
WHY WHY WAS A STILL A COVER UP GOING ON AS LATE AS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I THINK A LOT OF YOUR GORGEOUS JUSTIN PROBABLY AROSE OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT THEY GOT THEM SO THEY GOT THEMSELVES SO FAR IN IN THE IN THIS
WHAT MIGHT YOU CALL IT PRETENDING THAT THEY'VE BEEN NOTHING AMISS WITH SOUTHEL THAT THEY HAD TO KEEP MAINTAINING THAT MET IT ANDY KERSHAW THANKS FOR TALKING TO US
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT SHORT WHILE AGO WE DIDN'T ITEM ABOUT EVELYN WAUGH BEING MISTAKEN WOMAN FOR A WOMAN BY TIME MAGAZINE AND AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION JUSTIN WAS HAVING LOTS OF CLAIMS ABOUT HOW THE AMERICANS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOME BRITISH NAMES WHICH WERE ACTUALLY MAIL WHEN THEY SOUNDED FEMALE WILL JAKE FROM BRIGHTON SAYS MY GREAT AUNT MARRIED AMERICAN CAR DEALING HIS FORENAME WAS PEARL
SIMON BLATTER WICK HAS ALSO GOT IN TOUCH WITH US DON'T FORGET THE WRESTLER BIG DADDY I DIDN'T KNOW THIS HIS NAME WAS SHIRLEY CRABTREE NOT ONLY POSH BOYS A FEMININE NAME SIMON POINTS UP GUY DICKINSON EMAILED TO SAY MY GREAT AND GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHERS WERE BOTH CALLED FLORENCE VEGA AND BAXTER ALERTS US TO THE FACT THAT THE AMERICANS ARE ALSO AT IT AT LEAST TO AN EXTENT ONE OF PRESIDENT REAGAN'S MALE ECONOMIC ADVISERS WAS CALLED BARREL FULL NAME BERYL WAYNE'S SPRINKLE
THERE YOU GO BOY CALLED SUE TIDIED NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE HERE'S A QUESTION WHAT IS STUDENT LIFE REALLY LIKE
OH NO WE'RE NOT ASK THAT QUESTION WELL I DID TELL YOU PLAYED AT THE BREAD ONLY JUST ADDED NO AT ME ALL RIGHT HA HA HA OOH HE MIGHT ASK HER LATER IN THE BREAD WE'RE NOT ASKING THAT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OTHER ISSUES AT NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT TO SAY THE LIST OF ISSUES ABOUT WHICH MOSCOW IN THE WEST DISAGREE HAS GROWN AS LONG AS A RUSSIAN WINTER THERE'S UKRAINE SERIOUS SANCTIONS NATO ENLARGEMENT YOU NAME IT AND THESE DAYS THERE'S BOUND TO BE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT IT AND AS ACCUSATIONS FLY EACH SIDE'S BEEN ACCUSING THE OTHER OF WAITING INFORMATION WAR
RECENT WEEKS RUSSIA'S BEEN INVOLVED IN A PARTICULARLY BITTER BATTLE OF WORDS WITH THE U.K. WITH THE RESULT THAT WHEN A MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT STEVE ROSENBERG TRAVELLED TO SIBERIA RECENTLY TO REPORT ON THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY HE UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND HIMSELF BECOMING THE STORY
O.K. FINE O.K. ANYWAY ALL RIGHT O.K. WHEN I TRAVELLED ACROSS RUSSIA AS A CORRESPONDENT A DECADE AGO LOCAL JOURNALISTS WOULD OFTEN ASK ME FOR AN INTERVIEW THEY WOULD ASK ME WHY I'D COME WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THEIR TOWN THEY'D ASKED TO ABOUT LIFE IN THE U.K.
THE QUESTIONS TODAY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND I WASN'T MUCH OF A LOSS REMOTE MOTORS WHEN HAVE GOT A VERY GOOD
WE'RE GOING TO WAR HE WAS IN A SUBURB OF NOVOSIBIRSK ALBIE B.B.C. TEAM IS AMBUSHED BY SIBERIAN T. V. THE RUSSIAN REPORTER INFORMS ME THAT THE RECENT B.B.C. PANORAMA FILM ON ALLEGED CRIME AND CORRUPTION WAS A LIE AND PROVOCATION
ARE YOU MAKING THE SAME KIND OF FILM HERE HE ASKS I TELL HIM THAT WE'RE DOING A NEWS REPORT ABOUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN RUSSIA TODAY
IS THAT A PROBLEM WHAT YOU GOING TO KEEP HIM ON THE WAY COULD BE THIS IS JUST UP ON IT IS HE REPLIES JUDGING BY THE KIND OF PROGRAMMES THE B.B.C. MAKES
THAT EVENING ON LOCAL TELEVISION WE ARE HEADLINE NEWS BUT
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS WHEN I WAS IT WAS PROBABLY DANCE GO IT'D HAVE GONE I'LL HAVE B. B. C. AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THREE MINUTES OF TELEVISION BEHIND THE NEWSREADER IS A PICTURE OF OUR CREW WITH THE WORDS ON HER MAJESTY'S SERVICE AS IF WERE A BUNCH OF DOUBLE OH SEVENS
THE ANCHOR DECLARES WRONGLY THAT WE ARE THE SAME JOURNALISTS WHO MADE THAT PANORAMA FILM ABOUT PUTIN SHE'S JUST HIT HIM ON THE WEATHER BUT HOW MUCH IS STUCK BUT IT'LL BE BUSIER NOW THEY'VE RECEIVED A NEW ASSIGNMENT STRAIGHT FROM B.B.C. HEADQUARTERS SAYS THE REPORTER AND HE POSES THIS QUESTION IS THE B.B.C. CORRESPONDENT BENDING THE TRUTH WHEN HE PROMISES HONEST REPORTING CHARMING BUT IT'S NOT JUST RUSSIAN REGIONAL TELEVISION WHICH HAS BECOME HOSTILE TO US
THIS IS A NATIONAL PHENOMENON IT'S A GROW UP IT'S LOWER CUT OUR MOTORING YET I'M GONNAE CHUNK A GADGET RUSSIAN STATE T.V. HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN RATHER A LOT OF BRITAIN BASHING RECENTLY IT ITS WEEKLY NEWS REVIEW PROGRAMME WITH THE PRESENTER HAS BLAMED BRITAIN FOR THE CRIMEAN WAR OF THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES THE MURDER OF A RUSSIAN TSAR
FOR RUSSIA'S PROBLEMS IN WORLD WAR ONE AND FOR WINSTON CHURCHILL WANTING TO DROP AN ATOM BOMB ON THE KREMLIN SUPPORTED AT THE MOVE THAT COURIER MIGHT ANT AFTER B.B.C. TWO'S TELEVISED WALKIE THIS MONTH
BASED AROUND A HYPOTHETICAL RUSSIAN ATTACK ON LATVIA RUSSIAN T. V. CONCLUDED THAT THE B.B.C. WAS SPOUTING POISON
THE RUSSIANS BELIEVE THAT IT'S BRITAIN WAGING AN INFORMATION WAR ON THEM NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS COLD WAR OF WORDS THE LITVINENKO CASE SYRIA BRUSH NATO TENSION
BUT ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY MOSCOW FEELS THE NEED TO CRITICISE BRITAIN AND THE WEST IN GENERAL IS THE DESIRE TO FIND SCAPEGOATS ABROAD FOR PROBLEMS BACK HOME SHE'S SLID IT IS IT'S NOT GOING TO START ON THAT IT'S NOT OVER SNACK IN NOVOSIBIRSK SIBERIAN T. V. HAS TRACKED US DOWN AGAIN
THIS TIME THEY'VE BARGED INTO THE OFFICE OF A BUSINESSMAN WE'RE INTERVIEWING BY NOW IT'S CLEAR WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED
THERE WE ARE AGAIN THIS TIME THEY GET MY NAME WRONG THEY ALLEGE THAT WE'VE BEEN FILMING THINGS WE HAVEN'T AND MOST BIZARRE OF ALL AND OBVIOUSLY BE ASCH T. V. SHOWS DILAPIDATED HOPES IN THE ESSEX SEASIDE TOWN OF JAYWICK
WITH THE COMMENTARY AND YOUR SNUGLY AS YOU'RE NOT QUITE THERE WE MAY HAVE PLENTY OF DIRT IN OUR CITY BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF DIRT IN THE WEST TO THAT QUID B.B.C. YOU MUST IT'S ITS THIS PRISM OF STREETS CONTROL T.V. THAT RUSSIAN VIEWERS GET THE IMAGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD A DISTORTED PICTURE BUT A HUGELY POWERFUL ONE
AND IT'S A STRONG SIGNAL THAT IN RUSSIA TODAY DEMONISING THE WEST HELPS MAKE THE HEADLINES AT HOME RATHER BETTER
STEVE ROSENBERG REPORTING THERE ON BEING THE SUBJECT OF THE STORY AND THEY MAKE A GARY'S RACING TIPS I WONDER
AREAS TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN RUSSIAN I CAN'T DO THAT NOW I THINK WE'RE A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM THE DRAWER FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN OF THE ROPE LEAGUE SO WHAT CHANCE I WONDER THAT MANCHESTER UNITED WILL BE PAIRED WITH LIVERPOOL

NEWS THAT A VOTE FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD CAUSE PROFOUND ECONOMIC SHOCK SPEAKING IN SHANGHAI WHERE HE'S ATTENDING A MEETING OF G.TWENTY FINANCE MINISTERS MISTER OSBORNE SAID NOW WOULD BE THE VERY WORST TIME FOR THE U.K. TO TAKE AN ENORMOUS ECONOMIC GAMBLE
THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD HAS SAID HE WILL BACK THE CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE YOU LORD HOWARD TOLD US THE U.K. WOULD THRIVE ON ITS OWN AND BE SORELY MISSED
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE SAYS OPERATION ELVEDEN WHICH EXAMINED ILLEGAL PAYMENTS BY JOURNALIST TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAS ENDED SCOTLAND YARD HAS DEFENDED THE INVESTIGATION WHICH COST MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS AND RESULTED IN THIRTY FOUR CONVICTIONS
FOOTBALL'S WORLD GOVERNING BODY FOR WILL GET A NEW PRESIDENT TODAY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN DELEGATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE GATHERED IN THE SWISS CITY OF ZURICH TO VOTE FOR A SUCCESSOR TO SEPP BLATTER WHO STOOD DOWN LAST YEAR AMID A CORRUPTION CRISIS
THE TIME TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE CHAIRMAN OF H. S. TWO HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE THAT WILL RUN FROM LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM MANCHESTER CLAIMS THE LINE IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO CHANGE BRITAIN FOR THE BETTER AND THAT'S DESPITE THE FACT THAT WILL BE TEN YEARS BEFORE A TRAIN RUNS CONSTRUCTION DOESN'T START UNTIL NEXT YEAR AND A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S AND A COMMITTEE OF LORD SAY IT IS NOT VALUE FOR MONEY WE'RE JOINED FROM SALFORD BY THE CHAIRMAN OF H. S. TWO DAVID HIGGINS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THIS THEN
WELL MUCH AS HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS IF YOU GO BACK TWO YEARS AGO I THINK THE QUESTION AND MANY MINES AS WILL IT HAPPEN AND SHOULD HAPPEN NOW AS I'VE JUST SPENT A MONTH TRAVELLING AROUND THE U.K. COMMUNITIES OR LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE GRABBING IT AND SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT TO REGENERATE COMMUNITIES REBALANCE BRITAIN AND I SEE THAT AS A REALLY
OF INTERNAL ISATION OF H. S. TWO NOW SO IT'S PURE YOU'RE SAYING IT BASED ON WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO YOU YEAH SUCH AN AMOUNT GOING FROM NEWCASTLE TO MANCHESTER TO BIRMINGHAM TO EAST MIDLANDS AND YOU SEE HE'S CHANGED THE BUSINESS
CRYING OUT FOR INVESTMENT SAYING CAN WE HAVE A CERTAIN CERTAINTY CAN WE DEFINE PARTICULARLY THE SECOND ROUTE TO LEEDS AND MANCHESTER AND THEN WHEN I INVEST ALONGSIDE WHERE THE STATIONS ARE THEY WANTING THE CERTAINTY BECAUSE OF COURSE WHEN YOU COMMISSIONED AT TO COMMISSION A REPORT FROM K.P.M.G. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IT FOUND THAT THE LINE WOULD MAKE FIFTY AREAS OF THE U.K. WORSE OFF
WE WELL THAT REPORT SHOWED IN THE END THERE THIS IS PREJUDICE OVERALL WAS NEARLY TWO AND HALF TIMES VALUE FOR THE MONEY THAT WAS INVEST IN THE PROJECT OH K. WHICH IS OF COURSE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT BOTH THE LORD'S ECONOMIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE IN THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE
WELL WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF PUBLIC HEARINGS IN THE COMMONS IT'S FINISHED THROUGH IN A VERY EFFECTIVE PROCESS IT SAID FIFTEEN HUNDRED DIFFERENCE EMISSIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S JUST CONCLUDED SUCCESSFULLY ITS COURSE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT'S BEEN STRUGGLING TO MAKE THIS CASE BUT YOU'RE NOW SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS
AS A RESULT OF KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO GO AHEAD IT IS GOOD FOR BUSINESSES BUT IN WHAT WAY HOW CAN IT ALREADY BE HAVING AN EFFECT HE'S JUST HAVE TO GO TO BIRMINGHAM NOW AND SEE THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT AND IT'S HAPPENING IN BIRMINGHAM END AND SALLY HORN NOW ON THE BACK OF THE FACT THAT PHASE ONE WILL OPEN IN THOSE AREAS IN TEN YEARS' TIME
WHAT SORT OF INVESTMENT WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ZE POINT TO SOME CONCRETE THING THAT HAS CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS YOU CAN SEE THE NEW HEADQUARTERS OR HEDGES THE SEA UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN BIRMINGHAM YOU CAN SEE THE DIMMER IN DEMOLITION OF THE OLD LIBRARY NEW SPECTRE OF OFFICE BUILDING THE FIRST STAGE OF NEW INVESTMENT HAPPENING IN BIRMINGHAM
TO HEADQUARTERS BEEN BASED AROUND SALLY HOME AT THE INTERCHANGE SIDE OF BIRMINGHAM THERE ARE BASED PURELY ON THE FACT THAT HEDGES TO HIS COMING IN TEN YEARS' TIME THAT'S IT BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID LOOK ALL THIS TALK ABOUT REBALANCING IT THERE'S A VERY REAL CHANCE HE COULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT IF PEOPLE CAN GET TO LONDON FASTER THEN IT'LL BENEFIT LONDON POSSIBLY MANCHESTER BUT THAT'S IT
IT'LL CERTAINLY MAKE COMMUTING TO LONDON MORE EFFECTIVE BUT THE REALITY IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ECONOMY THEIR BUSINESSES THAT ARE BASED IN LONDON THAT AREN'T COMPETITOR BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST STRUCTURE OF LONDON AND I GAVE THE EXAMPLE AT BANKS WOULD MOVE OUT OF BIRMINGHAM THE LORDS COMMITTEE SAID THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN OF COURSE IT DID HAPPEN WITH H.S.B.C. AND OTHERS WILL FOLLOW WHEN THE LINES OF
COMMUNICATION TRANSPORTATION OUR UP TO A WORLD CLASS STANDARD THERE IS OF COURSE MAKE YOUR POINTING TO EXAMPLES IN BIRMINGHAM JOHN TO MAINLY HE'S PROFESSOR OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANET UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HAS POINTED TO HIS ANALYSIS SUGGESTING THAT YOU IT'LL BENEFIT THE DOMINANT ECONOMIC CENTRES BUT IT'LL DRAIN SMALLER TOWNS AND CITIES
WELL THAT'S NOT THE CASE I WAS IN NEWCASTLE LAST WEEK AND THERE WERE SETTING OUT ALL FRIENDS THEY HAD TO GET THE BEST OUT IN DARLINGTON FROM THE HIGH SPEED TWO SERVICES OR COME WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS SERVICING A BIG BOOST FOR CONNECTING THEIR CITIES NOT JUST WITH LONDON BUT WITH BIRMINGHAM AND THESE MIDLANDS DAVID HIGGINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
TIME TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE SHOULD WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ORDER TO STAY INSIDE THE SINGLE MARKET IS IT IN ESSENCE REALLY THAT SIMPLE WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME TWENTY PAST SEVEN FRIENDS ANNIE MINTON BAD AS THE EDITOR IN CHIEF ECONOMIST VERY MUCH ALONG THOSE LINES AND SHE'S HERE NOW GOOD MORNING TEAS ANNIE CAN I PUT YOU WHAT LORD HOWARD WAS SAYING WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT VIEW IS IT'S GOING TO SCARE THE CATS VIEW DIDN'T QUITE USE THAT PHRASE BUT THERE IS IT WOULD BE OBVIOUS
BUT ONCE WE BROKE AWAY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY WOULD WANT TO DO TRADE DEALS WITH US JUST AS MUCH AS WE WANTED TO DO WITH
WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S A SCARY CAT VIEW FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL I THINK WHATEVER THE EVENTUAL TRADE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE Y. YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR A WHILE PROBABLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS THAT UNCERTAINTY IS GOING TO COST JOBS THAT UNCERTAINTY IS GOING TO HIT INVESTMENT THAT INTACT IS A VERY BAD THING TO HAVE ALREADY ON SUNDAY ABSOLUTELY THERE'S WORK THE PANDAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE TWO THOUSAND THEY'D ALREADY BE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE SINGLE MARKET LOOK AT THE MESS THAT EUROPE IS IN THIS UNCERTAINTY ON BOTH SIGH ACTUALLY ARGUMENT ACTUALLY
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT MANY THINGS BUT ONE THING THAT I THINK SEEMS PARTICULARLY ROBUST IS IN FACT THE SINGLE MARKET AND THE SINGLE MARKET IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST SINGLE MARKET FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE AND WE GAIN ENORMOUSLY FROM UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THAT MARKET AND THE QUESTION IS WOULD WE HAVE THE SAME KIND OF ACCESS THAT WE WERE NOT A MEMBER OF THE E.U. AND I THINK THE OUT CAMPAIGN RADICALLY OVER SIMPLIFIES WHAT IT SAYS OH WELL EVERYONE WOULD WANT TO TRADE WITH US LET'S THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. HAS WITH OTHER PLAYERS ARE NORWAY AS YOU KNOW IS ONE THAT THE AD CAMPAIGN FIGHTS A LOT
NO HE DOES HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET BUT NO WAY EXCEPT ALL OF THE SINGLE MARKET RULES NORWAY PAYS INTO THE E.U. BUDGET ALMOST AS MUCH AS WE DO PER HEAD ANNOY HAS FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR SO IT HAS ALL OF THE IMMIGRATION ISSUES THAT WE ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT HERE BUT WHEN YOU GO TO THE NORWEGIAN PEOPLE YOU LOOK AT THEIR OPINION POLLS AND YOU ASK THEM THE QUESTION AS THEY ARE REGULARLY ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY SAY NO
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU ASK THE NORWEGIANS WHETHER THAT WITH THEY THINK WE WOULD BE HAPPY WITH THE RELATIONSHIP WE'VE GOT THEY'VE GOT WITH THEM AS YOU HEARD EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME WHEN I DID MY COMMENTARY YOU KNOW WE CAN PRIME MINISTER SAID DO YOU REALLY WANT THIS YEAH BUT THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT THERE THE PRIME MINISTER AND WE'VE HAD THE FIRE MINISTER ON THIS PROGRAMME AS WELL SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NORWEGIAN PEOPLE SEEM PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH THE RELATIONSHIP
WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHETHER THE BRITISH PEOPLE WILL GET WHAT THEY THINK THEY WILL GET FROM A FOR THE LEAVING OF THE E.U. I THINK PART OF THE DEBATE RIGHT NOW IS A DEBATE THAT IS FOCUSED MUCH MORE ON EMOTION ON BOTH SIDES ACTUALLY THEN TO THE RATIONAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS I THINK YOU NEED TO THINK THAT ECONOMICS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE UNION YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S SECURITY AND ALL OF THOSE CARROTS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ON BALANCE IT IS BETTER TO STAY AND I FOCUSED IN MY COMMENTARY VERY MUCH ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE AND I THINK THERE
IN THE SHORT TERM IT'S CLEAR THAT THEIR COSTS ARE LEAVING AND IN THE LONG TERM I THINK THE RISKS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY POTS WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THERE WOULD BE IN YOUR VIEW THE POSITION WE'D GET TO THE TRADE WISE I MEAN OH OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE TRADING ARRANGEMENTS ARE YOU SAYING THERE WOULD BE EFFORTS TO STOP US TRADING WITH EUROPEAN NO I THINK THE EUROPEANS WOULD BE WHAT WOULD BEAT THAT EUROPEANS WOULD WITH THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY BE A TRADE AGREEMENT I SUSPECT IT WOULD END UP BEING
CLOSE TO THAT OF NORWAY AT BEST AND NOT ALWAYS IN MY VIEW WORSE THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW BECAUSE NORWAY HAS NO SAY IN THE REGULATIONS THAT IT HAS TO IT A OR TWO AND WE CURRENTLY AS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DO IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO GET OTHER PEOPLE SAY WE DO HAVE A SAY BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECIDE WHERE AN IMPORTANT AGAIN O.K. WE'RE AN IMPORTANT PLAYER ARE OFTEN MUCH BETTER TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE THEN IT IS NOT TO BE IN THE ROOM WANT NORWAY HAVE BEEN CAKE AS A GIVEN SUPPOSE NO HE HAS TO TAKE US GIVEN THE RULES AT THE EUROPEAN SET
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT HEAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THIS SINGLE ARGUMENT ABOUT A TRADING RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE THE ARGUMENT THE PEOPLE FOCUS ON AND DECIDE ON
I THINK THE BRITISH PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE THE DECISION ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTS I THINK THAT ON THE ECONOMIC GROUNDS IN THE TRAINING GROUND FOR ME THERE IS A VERY CLEAR ARGUMENT TO STAYING OF COURSE IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE THERE IS ALSO A SECURITY AT THE TIME EITHER REFUSE TRUMPET THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING AND ALSO THE SERVANT HERE SHE DID THIS JUST HIGHLY WE WANT CARE A MANIA IS SUE YOU ACCEPTING THAT MIGHT TRUMP THE TRADE AGREEMENT EVEN IF THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES TO BE JUST AND YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A DECISION AS GRAVEN IMPORTANT AS THIS ONE WITH A BIGGER CONSEQUENCES YOU NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORS INVOLVED YOU NEED TO WEIGH UP
WHAT YOU THINK ON EACH OF THEM AND WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR YOU DIFFERENT PEOPLE WILL PUT DIFFERENT WEIGHTS ON DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS SO THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE AD CAMPAIGN FOR WHOM IMMIGRATION AND CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IF THAT IS YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE THEN THERE IS A GOOD ARGUMENT FOR LEAVE IT BUT IN MY VIEW I THINK BRITAIN IS WORSE OFF AND I THINK THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE IS EVEN AN IMMIGRATION WE WOULD BE WORSE OFF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IMMIGRANTS FROM THE E.U. BUT I THINK THE PRICE WE WOULD PAY ECONOMICALLY AND IN TERMS OF OUR SECURITY
AND IN TERMS OF FRANKIE THE FUTURE OF EUROPE IS SO HIGH THAT IT IS NOT WORTH DOING BUT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SAY ONE ISSUE TRAMPS AND YOU'D STOP ANTI THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A LOT IS NOT JUST IT'S NOT I'VE BEEN PREGNANT THING SUFFER AND IT'S NOT YOUR EITHER STUFF OR NO YOU'RE NOT IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT I THINK IT'S BETTER TO PULL SOME SOVEREIGNTY AND HAVE MORE POWER AS A RESULT DONE HIM INTO MEADOWS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE CONNERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT IS STUDENT LIFE REALLY LIKE NOW THE FUTURE STARTS NOW REVISION
HOW'S THE REVISION GOING FROM THEM INCIDENT SUPREME ALLOTMENT SHOWER I WANT NO
WELL THAT WAS A TRAILER FOR THE FINAL SERIES OF CHANNEL FOUR'S COMEDY FRESH MEAT WHICH STARTED ON MONDAY BUT ONLY BEING FAIR TO TODAY'S STUDENTS IS WRITTEN BY THE WRITERS THE PEEP SHOW WERE IN THEIR FORTIES AND UNIVERSITY HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT EVEN IN THE FEW YEARS THAT THAT SHOW HAS BEEN AIRING IT THAT IS OF COURSE SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF TUITION FEES WERE POLLY BARTLETT'S IN HER FINALLY AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AT MANCHESTER SHE JOINS US TIM LOAN IS NOW IN HIS FIFTIES HE WROTE THE COMEDY TEACHERS
WHICH WAS THAT MY BROADCAST A DECADE AGO AND HE NOW TEACHES CREATIVE WRITING AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING HELLO POLLY BUT I THINK YOU'RE A FAN ANYWAY OF THIS PROGRAMME AREN'T YOU YEAH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS IS IT ANYTHING LIKE YOUR LIFE
I MEAN AS IF YOU'RE KIND OF SMALL RESEMBLANCES IN THERE BUT I THINK DEFINITELY STUDENT LIFE HAS MOVED ON FROM WHAT THEY'RE PORTRAYING IN THE SHOW MOVED ON IN WHAT WAY
I THINK THAT STUDENTS ARE DEFINITELY MORE RESPONSIBLE THEN THEY'RE MADE OUT TO BE AND I MEAN I CAN SEE YOU LIKE THERE ARE SOME SIMILAR FEATURES A STUDENT LIFE BUT DEFINITELY I THINK WE WORK A LITTLE BIT HARDER HER DAYS MAYBE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS TO PAY BACK AT THE END OF ART
AT THE END OF OUR TIME HERE BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT YEAH CAN WE JUST A BIT MORE RESPONSIBLE AND THEY WERE MADE OUT TO BE IRONED ON FRESH MEAT AND DOES THAT IRRITATE YOU THAT THE IDEA
THE STEREOTYPE OF THE STUDENT LIFE IS NOT IS NOT AS YOU SEE IT UM I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HIT ME THAT MUCH IN THE SHOW JUST BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY DRAMA IS THERE FOR ENTERTAINMENT IS THAT TO MAKE US LAUGH BUT I THINK IT DEFINITELY
IRRITATES THE OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE MAYBE FOR PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA OR IN NEWSPAPERS AND ABOUT JUST GOING OUT DRINKING ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT DOING ANY WORK SO YES SOMETIMES I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING BECAUSE
YEAH YOU NEED TO LEARNING A NEW FOR CAN I HAVE TRYING TO MAKE OURSELVES BETTER I THINK WINNIE CREDIT FOR THAT LET ME BRING IN TIM LOAN HERE DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS THEY WERE YOU GETTING THERE GETTING REPRESENTATION RIGHT IN A COMEDY AT MOTHERS ARE DEPENDING ON THE TABLE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT TO LOOK AFRESH ME IS THAT THE GHEE AGENDA IS CLEARLY TO HAVE FUN
SO I THINK IT'S NOT FAIR ON THE SHOW TO START TRYING TO TAKE HER TO SERIOUSLY HAVE TO SAY IS IT UNFAIR ON STUDENTS DON'T BLAME FATHER TED FOR BEING UNFAIR ON PRE FAWLTY TOWERS OF A HOTEL SO IT'S IT'S WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR AGENDA THE AGENDA THE PROGRAMME MAKERS AS I DO YOU THINK THE POINT IS AS VALID THAT THERE IS ROOM THERE FOR A WHOLE DIFFERENT DRAMA WHICH TAKES STUDENT LIFE A BIT MORE SERIOUSLY BUT THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO A FRESH MEAT WHICH IS A BEETLE INDEED ABOUT PERHAPS THE FOCUS ISN'T FRESH MEAT IT'S JUST USING IT AS A HOOK TO SHOW HOW
MUCH STUDENT LIFE HAS CHANGED IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT WAS A POINT MADE BY IN FACT VICE ARTICLE WHICH THAT SINCE THAT PROGRAMME WAS STARTED BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT
OF THE SEAS NOW ON STUDENTS IT'S IT LOOKS OUT OF TOUCH I DO WELL IT WELL THAT'S A TOUCH I DO I DO THINK THAT I DO THINK LIFE IS DIFFERENT YES DEFINITELY MY SON CHARLIE AS A STARTED AT MUSIC GOLDSMITHS IN LONDON AND I BELIEVE HE HAD TO TAKE HIS IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND PERHAPS THEY DID ALL THOSE MANY YEARS AGO BUT THEY WERE THE MOST SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING FUN I THINK I AGREE WITH WHAT POLLY WAS SAYING
THEY'RE VERY GOOD I THINK TO BECOME VERY GOOD AT COMPARTMENTALISING THING SO THEY GO OUT THEY GO CRAZY AT WEEKENDS OR WHATEVER WELL GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT MATE BUT THEY'RE ALSO THEY MAKE SURE THEY TURN UP I THINK THAT THERE IS AT THE ATTENDANCE IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS THERE'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY THERE FOR US SHOULDN'T LIFE NOW THAT DIDN'T WASN'T THERE CERTAINLY WASN'T THERE WHENEVER I WAS THERE I CAN SEE HERE'S A QUESTION IS THAT A GOOD OR A BAD THING WHAT DO YOU THINK
I THINK TIM WAS RIGHT YEAH IT'S A GOOD THING THAT STUDENTS CAN NOW BALANCED AND BEARING OUT ON LIKE A MAD ONE AT THE WEEKEND BUT THEY'RE NOT MISSING LECTURES BECAUSE THEY COST NOW I THINK I WENT OUT ON MY COURSE ONE OURS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS WOW SO WE DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT NINE A.M. LECTURE COS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO THROW MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN SO YEAH I THINK THE OTHER MY LECTURE
I'M ACTUALLY MISSING ON THE HOUSE HERE WE GO IT'S ALL RIGHT
WHICH IS THEN YEAH MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET ME NOBODY'S LETS HIM DOWN BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE YOU MISSED AND NO I CAN I'VE MISSED A FEW IN MY TIME I WILL ADMIT I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO GO TO AS MANY AS I CAN JUST BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY COSTS SO MUCH NOWADAYS IT'S EXTRAORDINARY IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT GENERATION REALLY WHEN THE EXPERIENCE GIVE WHAT POLLY SINGER YEAH IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING THAT THAT LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK WE'RE STUDENTS AND THEIR ATTENDANCE ON THE DELIVERY OF ESSAYS AND STUFF UNIVERSITY WILL COME DOWN THEM LIKE A TON OF BRICKS HAVE THEY DON'T DO
WHAT IT IS THAT ARE MEANT TO DO BUT THERE SHOULD BE REALLY AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO DO THAT OTHER OTHER THAN GETTING INTO TROUBLE I MEAN A HARD PUNCH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM SOME OF THEM LIKE MY SON WORKING TWENTY HOURS PART TIME WHILE HAVING TO STUDY FULL TIME AND ALL THIS WORK BUT TO BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING TO WORK SO HARD BEEN PUNISHED BY THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AND DEATH AT THE END SO IT'S A SHAME I WISH WE COULD GIVE THEM MORE INCENTIVE

PLAYER AND STRIKER FOR FRANCE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR

CARRY OUT MOST REFORM OF THE ORGANISATION YEAH MORE THAN THAT I THINK IS HE'S BEEN PROVING THAT HE IS CAPABLE OF FLYING
DOING WHAT HE'S SAYING TO THEM HE'S WILLING TO REALLY CHANGED
THE POWER OF SOUFFLE IN THE WAY THAT HE'S BEEN CONVICTED OVER THE YEARS AT THE FRONT RUNNER OF COURSE IS SHAKES SALMON FROM THE BAHRAIN Y. WHO'S HAD SOME FAMILIES HAD ALL SORTS OF CRITICISMS ACCUSATIONS OF PAST DIFFICULTIES WITH HUMAN RIGHTS IF HE
IS ELECTED AS EXPECTED KENNY CANNAE TURN FEVER AROUND I DON'T THINK IT WAS ON THE CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE THAT READ THE SCENE OF THOSE CRITICS IT'S A REALLY BAD WE TOOK HIM AND BY CORRUPTION HAS BEEN THE DOWNFALL OF
OVER THE YEARS AND SOMEONE IS ALREADY IN A VERY GOOD PLACE AS A FAVOUR IT'S AND THAT HAS BEEN DRAGGED INTO THE STORY'S ALREADY SOY HISTORY REALLY STRANGE'S LOGICAL FOR ME AS A FUN AS A PLAYER
AS A AS A SPORTSMAN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE A BAD EXAMPLE TO THE KIDS DOES IT MATTER FROM THE PLAYER'S POINT OF VIEW WHO IS ELECTED YES IT DOES MATTER BECAUSE YOU'RE WHAT YOU DRANK IN TO IT'S TWO STORIES EVERY WEEK YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING LIKE THIS OF A NON MAYBE IN SIX MONTHS' TIME AND SAYING OH YES WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND WE'VE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT WE JUST ACTUALLY

OF THE ORGANISATION AND IT WASN'T AWARE OF THE POWER OF FEVER SO WE CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE BEEN OUTSIDE COMPANY AS FINDS US PLAYERS WE JUST LEARNED WAS HER ENJOYMENT I WOULD SAY SWORD THE ACTUAL BUSINESS PART HE'S REALLY REALLY BACK AND REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND SAW MANY MANY FLOORS OF OF MONEY
HAS BEEN GOING ON OVER THE REALLY COMPLICATED IT IS THERE A POINT WHERE FOOTBALL COULD SAY THAT WE JUST DON'T NEED FAVOUR WE COULD QUIRK WE'VE GOT THIS CHAMPIONSHIPS WE CAN RUN WE CAN RUN THEM CLEANLY THE POWER OF SPOT IS IT SAW THE FANS IS HE WILL NEVER CHANGE PRESIDENT ON THE PRESIDENTS ARE MORE OR LESS IT'S IN ITS ORGANISATION DIFFERENTLY TOO
TO PUT PRESSURE ON ON THE SPONSORS TO PUT PRESSURE ON OUR I'M PRESIDENT OF FIGURATION HE DID IT IS NEEDED BUT THOSE POLLARD NEEDS TO BE SPREAD THAT ONE MEN CAN DECIDE EVERYTHING LIKE A DEAD AS HE HAD BEEN YOU'VE BEEN DONE OVER THE PAST YES YOU OF COURSE OBSESSIVE STOP PLAYING OR BEING INVOLVED WITH AS I SAY WITH KNOWLEDGE WITH TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL IS IT SOMETHING YOU WOULD EVER THINK LOOK I SHOULD GO FOR THIS LET'S SORT IT OUT

WITH PEOPLE WHO SEND BY USING BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO WIN IT SO IS THAT A YES OR A NO NO IT'S A NO NO A DEFINITE NO BECAUSE I JUST I JUST DON'T LIKE POLITICS ANYWHERE'S BECAUSE
HE DRUGGED PEOPLE INTO BAD HABITS LEWIS AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THAT I'M SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE LET ME QUOTE SOMETHING FROM DAME JANET SMITH'S REPORT THAT REPORT INTO HER JIMMY SAVILE'S ABUSE AT THE B. B. C. HERE WE GO AT THAT TIME SHE SAID
IT APPEARED TO ME THAT MANY PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY GENERALLY AND THEREFORE PROBABLY ALSO WITHIN THE B.B.C. DID NOT REGARD THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AS AN IMPORTANT MATTER I THINK THERE WAS A GENERAL PERCEPTION IN SOME PARTS OF THE B. B. C. THAT MANY GIRLS ARE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN WERE READY AND WILLING TO HAVE SEX WITH POP IDOL'S I THINK PEOPLE TOOK THE VIEW THAT IF THESE GIRLS WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH CELEBRITIES
IT WAS A MATTER FOR THEM THAT DAME ESTHER RANTZEN IS HERE FORMER B.B.C. PRESENTER AND FOUNDER OF CHILDLINE AND SAYS DAVID AROUND A BITCH THE TIMES COLUMNIST MORNING TO YOU BOTH IT WAS A STAGGERINGLY DIFFERENT TIME AND OF THE MANY THINGS THAT COME OUT
THIS REPORT THEY WOULD RUN WHICH ISN'T THAT REALLY ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING HOW HOW CHANGED WE ARE YES I THINK IT I THINK IT IS
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT GARY POCKETS UNION GAP SANG A YOUNG GIRL ON TOP OF THE POPS WHICH HAS GET OUTTA HERE BEFORE I HAVE THE TIME TO CHANGE MY MIND THIS IS A GUY TALKING TO A GIRL WHO'S PLAYING UNDER UNDERAGE AND SO ON AND WHO INTRODUCED THAT SONG ON TO TOP OF THE POPS JIMMY SADDLE
INTRODUCED IT IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES BILL WYMAN HAD A RELATIONSHIP STARTING WITH A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO WAS FOURTEEN EFFECTIVELY SHE SAYS LATER WHEN IT WAS CONSUMMATED JOHN PEEL ADMIT IT IN FACT IT WASN'T EVEN ADMISSION IT WAS HE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT HIS PAST LIFE THAT HE HADN'T ASKED FOR I.D. AMONGST THE VERY YOUNG GIRLS WHO'D ASKED FOR SEXUAL FAVOURS WHEN HE WAS WHEN HE WAS A D.J. IN HIS EARLY PART OF HIS CAREER
AND IT'S SINGING AND YET JOHN PEEL IS A MUCH LOVED FIGURE WAS A MUCH LOVED FIGURE AT THE B.B.C. AMONGST CERTAINLY AMONGST THE SHOWBUSINESS TYPES AMONGST THE CUT AND THE AND THE POP TARTS AND SO ON THERE WAS A KIND OF LACK OF INTEREST AND ONE OF THINGS THAT JANE DENNIS THAT THEN JAN SMITH SAYS IT'S THAT CHILD PROTECTION AND EVEN THE CONCEPT OF THESE KIT PEOPLE AS
CHILDREN SIMPLY WASN'T THERE BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN SAMANTHA FOX BECAME A PAGE THREE GIRL ON THE SUN BEARING HER CHEST TO BE A SORT OF KIND OF MASTURBATORY FANTASY FOR MEN SHE WAS SIXTEEN SO NO WONDER PEOPLE REGARDED THIS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAD A KIND OF LINE AND IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY VALUE HAS TO RANSOM BUT IT DOES EXPLAIN DOESN'T IT
ONLY UP TO A POINT BECAUSE WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT JIMMY SADDLE IS THAT HE WAS RAPING LITTLE GIRLS HE WAS RAPING LITTLE BOYS TO AS YOUNG AS EIGHT NINE TEN AND THAT WAS NEVER ACCEPTABLE
HOWEVER I THINK WHAT HAS CHANGED RADICALLY AT ALMOST EXACTLY THIRTY YEARS AGO
WE DID AN ITEM ON THAT'S LIFE ABOUT CHILD SEX ABUSE AND WE OPENED HELP LINES AFTER IT THE HELP LINE WAS OPEN FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN THAT TIME NEARLY ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN DISCLOSED THAT THEY WERE SUFFERING CURRENT SEXUAL ABUSE THAT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT ANY OTHER WAY
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SEXUAL ABUSE IS A CRIME THAT
TAINTS AND DEFILES THE VICTIM BUT WE DIDN'T THINK IT THEN AND THAT'S THAT OH YES WE IT REALLY IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW IN THAT CASE WHY WERE ALL THESE RUMOURS ABLE TO SWIRL AROUND AND YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE WHO HEARD THE RUMOURS WEREN'T YOU AND YET I MEAN EVEN TODAY WE WOULD TAKE IT DESPERATELY SERIOUSLY WE TURN LOUIS ISN'T WE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY IT OUT OR SENIOR MANAGEMENT WE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY THEN JUST IT DIDN'T COME OUT AGAIN WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT WE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY THEN BUT
IF YOU HEAR WHAT I SAY IF YOU EMPATHISE FOR A MOMENT THAT DIFFICULTY THOSE VICTIMS HAD AND STILL HAVE DISCLOSING WHAT WAS DONE TO THEM MEANT THAT THEY DIDN'T COME FORWARD AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE YOU CAN WORK ON
IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS HE DID IT TO ME OR SOMEONE WHO SAYS I SAW IT HAPPENING LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH I THINK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT WHY DID NONE OF THESE CASES COME TO COURT
EVEN WHEN VICTIMS GOT THEIR COURAGE TOGETHER AND TOLD THE POLICE AND THE REASON IS THAT A LEGAL SYSTEM IS BALANCED AGAINST THE CHILD BUT MAYBE NOT MAYBE NOW DAVID ALDRIDGE BALLAST IN THE OTHER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ESTHER AND I HAD AN EXCHANGE ABOUT WAS AFTER THE FILM SPOTLIGHT WAS RELEASED WHICH TALKED ABOUT THE ABUSE IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SO ON AND THE NEWSPAPERS PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT ON IT
ONE OF THINGS THAT WAS IN THE FILM WAS EFFECTIVELY THAT THE SAME SET OF JONAS OR SOME OF THEM HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN SIMILAR STORIES AND HER BURIED THEM BECAUSE
THEY HADN'T SEEN THEM AS BEING AS IMPORTANT AS THEY CAME TO SEE THEM I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT ESTHER'S COMPLETELY RIGHT ABOUT THE ILLEGALITY OF IT ON THE LINE I'M A MORAL FORCE AND SHE'S ALSO WRITE ABOUT HER OWN ROLE I THINK IN BEING A MAJOR MOTOR OF CHANGE BUT TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVEN'T CHANGED SOCIETY I THINK IS COMPLETELY RHYMING TO SEE EXAMPLE MARITAL RAPE WAS LEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY UP UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY ONE
WE ONLY MADE ILLEGAL CORPORAL PUNISHMENT IN SCHOOLS IN STATE FUNDED SCHOOLS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AS TO HOW OF COURSE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THERE AND IN COURTS OF LAW JUDGES USED TO HAVE TO WARN JURIES BUT THE WORD OF A WOMAN
OR THE WORD OF A CHILD WAS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON IN CASES OF SEXUAL OFFENCE CELEBRATING THAT WE HAVE GOT SOMEWHERE AND DAME JANICE NESSA PEOPLE'S PIECE OF SOCIAL HISTORY PERHAPS TELLS US HOW FAR WE'VE COME IF ONLY IF ONLY IT WERE EASY AS SHE HOPES IT COULD BE FOR WHISTLEBLOWERS TO ACTUALLY DRAW ATTENTION
IN ANY ORGANISATION NOT JUST BROADCASTING ORGANISATIONS BUT THE HEALTH SERVICE ANY OTHER ORGANISATION AND IT'S NOT WE'RE OUT OF TIME AT THEIR NEST ROUND TO DAVID A RUN OF IT AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE ANDREW BRYSON AND DOWN KELLY FROM US ALL GOOD MORNING
