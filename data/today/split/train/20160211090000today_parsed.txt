THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAD IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND MANY OF THEM LEAD
ON SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOGAN HOW THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER IS WRITTEN IN THE GUARDIAN TODAY AS SAYING THE SIGNALLING A SHIFT IN ATTITUDE TO RAPE CLAIMS SAYING THAT THE POLICY ORDERING DETECTORS TO AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO BE RAPED OR SEXUALLY ABUSED MAYBE DROPPED BUT IT'S THE FACT THAT HE HASN'T APOLOGISED HE SAID LAST NIGHT
B.B.C. INTERVIEW IN A LECTURE THAT HE COULDN'T APOLOGISE THAT IS ALSO ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH AND THE DAILY MAIL DAILY MAIL'S HEADLINE AND STILL HE WON'T SAY SORRY SUGGESTING THAT IT'S A SNUB TO LORD BRAMALL
LORD RAM AND OF COURSE THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY WHO HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR A SERIOUS OFFENCE BUT THEN THE THAT INVESTIGATION WAS NOT PURSUED HE WAS CLEAR
THE TELEGRAPH HAS AN INTERESTING LEAD HE'S GOT HOLD OF A REPORT BY THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY THAT'S THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG AND IT SAYS THAT MISLEADING BUY ONE GET ONE FREE DEALS AND SPECIAL OFFERS IN SUPERMARKETS COULD BE BANNED WITHIN WEEKS BECAUSE THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY ARE SEDUCING ASKED SEDUCING SHOPPERS INTO SPENDING AN EXTRA ONE THOUSAND POUNDS
A YEAR MAJOR STORES INCLUDING WAITROSE TESCO SAINSBURY ASDA ARE HAVING THEIR PRICING PRACTICES EXAMINED BY THE C.M.A. AFTER YOU THE CONSUMER GROUP WHICH INVOKED A RARELY USE LEGAL POWER TO LAUNCH WHAT'S CALLED A SUPER COMPLAINT AND DEMAND ACTION AGAINST SUPERMARKETS THE REPORT'S DUE NEXT MONTH UNDERSTOOD TO RECOMMEND ACTION AGAINST SUPERMARKETS WHICH OFFER DEALS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN GENUINE SAVINGS
THERE IS A VERY GRUESOME STORY ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES WHICH IS THE YOUNG LAD THE BRITISH BOY FOUR YEAR OLD ICE ADAIR WHO WAS HAS BEEN FILMED HER DEATH AND DETONATING A CAR BOMB THAT APPEARS TO HAVE KILLED THREE MEN
IN SYRIA AND IT'S BELIEVED TO BE IN SYRIA WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT ANDY THIS IS THE BOY IN FACT IN WE'D SEEN HIM IN AN EARLIER VIDEO WITH US THIS IS THE LATEST
SLIPPY FILMED A VIDEO FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE MALE AS A STORY THAT SAYS IF YOU DON'T DO ENOUGH EXERCISE IN MIDDLE AGE OR BRAIN WILL SHRINK YOU HAVE BEEN
IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
EVER SINCE EINSTEIN PROPOSED HIS THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF GRAVITY WAVES TODAY THEY'RE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY FOUND THEM
TOM FIELD AND IS A SCIENCE EDITOR ANTON QUITE A MOMENT VERY EXCITING THREE THIRTY THIS AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE LYRE GO TEAM IN THE U.S. THAT'S THE LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL WAVE OBSERVATORY TO YOU AND ME WILL PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THEIR SEARCH FOR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES RIPPLES IN THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON
AND IT IS EXPECTED THEY'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THEY HAVE SPOTTED UP TO THREE DISTINCT SIGNALS OR CHIRPS WHICH WILL BE THE TELLTALE ECHOES OF HUGE COSMIC COLLISIONS BLACK HOLE SPIRALLING AROUND BEFORE CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER SUPERNOVAE EXPLODING
ALL THAT GOING ON MILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS ACROSS ACROSS THE UNIVERSE VERY EXCITING STUFF AND THIS IS TO MAKE THE POINT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THEY THOUGHT THEY'D FOUND IT BEFORE THEY HAVE SEVERAL TIMES ACTUALLY THEY'VE BEEN THERE'S JUST SO MANY EXPERIMENTS LOOKING AT THIS WITH THE MOST RECENT WAS BICEP TOO I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS WHERE THIS IDEA OF CHIRPING COMES FROM THAT TURNED OUT TO BE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM BACKGROUND NOISE THE EXCITEMENT WENT AWAY AGAIN BUT THIS TIME
THIS TIME WE REALLY HAVE SEEN IT IS IT WHEN WE PLAYED A CLIP OF A CHUR UP AS IT'S BEEN CORPSE IS THAT THAT'S WHAT A GRAVITY WOULD SOUND LIKE WELL YES I MEAN BASICALLY WHAT YOU GET OR WHAT WE THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO BE TOLD THAT THAT YOU GET IS THIS SORT OF BUILDING TO A CRESCENDO IN THERE THEY'VE GOT A IT'S LIKE A GRAPH RUNNING AND IT'S LISTENING OUT FOR
IF YOU TURN IT INTO SOUND WAVES THEN YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET A SORT OF FLAT LINE BOBBLING ALONG THEN SLOWLY STARTS BUILDING UP INTO A CRESCENDO REACHES A CLIMAX AND THEN DROPS OFF AGAIN SO IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A CHURCH
AND THAT THAT THAT'S WERE A WAY OF INTERPRETING OR REPRESENTING WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THIS IS PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE QUESTION BUT HAVING ESTABLISHED OR WITH AS WE UNDERSTAND THIS THIS AFTERNOON HAVING ESTABLISHED IT WHAT THEN WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES IT MEAN WELL THERE ARE TWO REAL REASONS WHY THIS IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE FIRST IS GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE THE LAST OUTSTANDING PREDICTION FROM EINSTEIN'S GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY ALL THE OTHER ONES THE BIG BANG EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE BLACK HOLES THOSE HAVE ALL REALLY BEEN CONFIRMED SO THE DISCOVERY
OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT'S LIKE THE CLATTER OF THE CROWNING GLORY FOR FOR RELATIVITY CONFIRMS IT WAS ONE OF MANKIND'S REALLY GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THE SECOND AND THE REALLY EXCITING THING IS THAT GRAVITY WAVES ALSO OFFER US ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE EVERYTHING WE KNOW EVERYTHING WE'VE LEARNT SO FAR WE'VE DONE MATT USING LIGHT TELESCOPES THEY GATHER LIKE YOUR EYES WHEN YOU LOOK UP AT THE NIGHT SKY YOU'RE GATHERING LIGHT
BUT LIGHT DOESN'T TELL US EVERYTHING BECAUSE MOST OF THE UNIVERSE IS DARK IT DOESN'T INTERACT WITH LIGHT GRAVITY WAVES WOULD GIVE US A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE AND THAT COULD REVEAL ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING ELSE TO GUARD HER HEADS ROUND TOM FEEL THANKS VERY MUCH I THINK I UNDERSTOOD THAT WHILE
WELL DONE TOM THANK YOU IT IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX NOW IF YOUR RAIL JOURNEY HAS DELAYED US A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF STAFF THAT'S WHAT THE B. B. C. AS LEARNED RICHARD WESCOTT ON TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT ONE IN TEN RICHARD
YES BASICALLY DUE TO CREW SHORTAGES WE'VE GOT THE FIGURES FROM THAT FROM THE REGULATOR SO LEGIT AND ON AVERAGE THOSE BROKEN DOWN BY A COMPANY BUT ON AVERAGE ONE IN TEN TIMES THAT YOUR TRAIN IS LATE IS BECAUSE THIS SIMPLY ISN'T NORMALLY A DRIVER TO DRIVE IT WHY
WHERE THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION WITHOUT ACTUALLY BREAK IT DOWN BYE BYE WHY THE PEOPLE AREN'T THERE SO SOMETIMES IT'S SICKNESS SOMETIMES IT'S LEAVE ROSS THE PROBLEMS WITH SOMETIMES THERE PROBABLY CAUGHT IN TRAFFIC OR EVEN
STUCK ON THE TRAIN FOR THAT WOULDN'T YOU I MEAN IT WORKED ON YOU WERE THE UNIONS BASICALLY SO IT'S A LACK OF FORWARD THINKING SO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT EASY TO TRAIN A DRIVER IT'S NOT CHEAP IT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOMEONE IN THAT I WAS SPOKE TO ONE THE OTHER DAY WHO'D JUST QUALIFIED HE WAS ONE OF A GROUP OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE APPLIED FOR THIS JOB THEY HAVE THREE MONTHS OF TESTS BEFORE WE EVEN PUT ON ON THE TRAINING SCHEME
AND THEN THERE'S A YEAR TO LEARN EACH ROOT INCH BY INCH SO IT'S VERY VERY SAFETY CONSCIOUS AT THE RULE BOOKS ENORMOUS UNIONS ARE SAYING WE'VE GOT THIS HUGE GROWTH IN THE RAILWAY ON THE RAIL COMPANIES JUST HAVEN'T EMPLOYED ENOUGH PEOPLE HADN'T WANTED TO SPEND THE MONEY TRAINING THEM UP AND AS A RESULT THEY'VE GOT CAUGHT OUT ALL THAT IT ISN'T IT IT'S YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THEY I SUPPOSE ARE ARGUING THAT IT'S THE UNIONS THAT IT'S CHEAPER TO PAY UPPY OCCASIONALLY THAN MEET THE WAGE BILL
SO WE DON'T KNOW YET POACHING WAS A PROBLEM FOR A WHILE AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD ANECDOTALLY IS YOU GET FREE COMPANIES KIND OF SPENDING A BIT OF MONEY TRAINING PEOPLE UP AND THEN THE SORT OF MAIN PASSENGER COMPANIES WANTED SOMEBODY THEY WOULD HAVE TO POACH THAT PERSON BUT YOU CAN'T JUST BUY A DRIVER BASICALLY AND PUT THEM ON YOUR LINE YOU HAVE TO TRAIN THEM UP ON THOSE LINES THERE HAD BEEN ALL THESE ISSUES RESPECT VARIOUS COMPANIES AND SAY THEY'VE GONE AND HIS BIG RECRUITMENT DRIVES NOW THEY WERE AWARE THERE WAS A PROBLEM THEY'VE GONE ON A RECRUITMENT DRIVE
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GETTING THIS ENORMOUS GROWTH THE RAILWAYS ARE GROWING AT A RECORD PACE EVERY YEAR FOUR OR FIVE PER CENT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY HUGE WE'RE GOING TO SORT OF RUN TO CATCH UP AT THE MOMENT RICHARD THANKS A LOT
IT'S NOW COULD PAST SIX SEND ALL THIS TURBULENCE IN THE MARKETS LATELY HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THE MOOD AT THE CENTRAL BANK SIMON JACK'S HERE MORNING SO YES JANET YELLOW THE CHAIR OF THE U.S. CENTRAL BANK THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS WORN FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAD BECOME LESS SUPPORTIVE IT WAS HER WORD OF GROWTH AND THE GLOBAL MARKET TURBULENCE COULD SET BACK U.S. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS INVESTORS HAVE TAKEN THAT OF THE LATEST SIGNAL THAT ANOTHER INTEREST RATE RISE FOLLOWING DECEMBER'S
MIKE COULD BE PUSHED BACK EVEN FURTHER HERE SHE IS GIVING HER ASSESSMENT IN HER LATEST APPEARANCE BEFORE CONGRESS
WE ARE WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS THEY WERE WE'D SEEM TO BE INCREASED FOR YOURS EVERY SESSION RISK FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME LESS SUPPORTIVE TO GROW
AND WE RECOGNISE THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORK AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT MANDATORY POLICY IS NOT ON THE PRIEST SAID QUARTERS
SO MIKE AMY IS MANAGING DIRECTOR AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER PIMP CARED A BIG BOD INVESTMENT COMPANY WHAT DID WE LEARN MUCH I THINK WITH WHAT WE LEARNT YESTERDAY WAS THAT NEAR WE'VE GOT CONFIRMATION THAT THE FED IS NOT IMMUNE TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND THEY RACE RATES IN DECEMBER
THE U.S. ECONOMY WAS GOING REASONABLY WELL AND THE REST THE WORLD HAD SOME CLOUDS THOSE CLOUDS ARE DARKENED AND WE'VE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE SHE'S ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT THE U.S. RATE CYCLE WILL BE PARTIALLY DEPENDENT UPON HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD PERFORMS JUST AS MUCH AS HOW THE U.S. PERFORM SO IT'S NOT A KIND I'M ALL RIGHT JACK I'M GOING TO PUT UP RATES BECAUSE THE U.S. ECONOMY DOES THAT LEAD ONCE TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ACTUALLY THEY JUMPED THE GUN THEY GOT A BIT OF BLOW BACK FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH THEY WHICH THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE
I THINK I THINK IF SHE HAD HER TIME AGAIN I SUSPECT SHE MIGHT THINK TWICE ABOUT HAVING THAT DECEMBER RIGHT HEIGHT BECAUSE OF COURSE THE WORLD HAS BECOME A SLIME WILL CHALLENGE PLACE NOW WHETHER THAT HAS IT BECOME A MORE CHARGE WISE BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE RATES ON I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT CHALLENGE THE MARKETS WERE WE'RE NOT REALLY THE FED RATE HIGH PER SE IT WAS THINGS REALLY GOT THINGS GOING WAS THAT WAS THE CHINESE DEVALUATION ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR
WHICH IF YOU RECALL LAST YEAR THE THING THAT SPEAK THE MARKET'S NASTY WAS AROUND THE CHINESE DEVALUATION SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S AS MUCH THAT AS WHAT THE FIT NOT TO O.K. IT WILL HOLD THAT THOUGHT BECAUSE LOTS OF COUNTRIES THEY MAY BE IN ON A RATE RISE AND CYCLE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CUTTING EVEN PUTTING THEIR RATES NEGATIVE
OUT HERE IN THE U.K. WE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A RATE RISE FOR SOME TIME WE'VE GOT NEGATIVE RATES AND JAPAN ARE TINKERING AS WE KNOW WITH INTEREST RATES AS ONE OF THE CENTRAL BANK'S MOST POWERFUL MONETARY TOOLS YOU RISE THEM TO STOP INFLATION YOU CUT THEM STAVE OFF DEFLATION HAT OR SO THE THEORY GOES BUT WITH INFLATION EMELI DEVELOPED ECONOMIES AROUND ZERO
WHAT DO YOU DO YOU RUN OUT OF AMMUNITION NOT SO SAYS ONE ECONOMIST IN TO HAVE A WIDE RANGING INTERVIEW WITH ADAIR TURNER THE FORMER HEAD OF THE U.K. FINANCIAL REGULATION SAYS THERE IS ANOTHER WAY APART FROM INTEREST RATES
YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY WELL WE'RE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND IF WE GET A NEW TWIST OF DEFLATION IN THE WORLD ECONOMY THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND DEFINITIVELY WRONG AND DANGEROUS IF A PROBLEM IS A DEFICIENCY
OF AGGREGATE NOMINAL DEMAND AGGREGATE SPENDING ACROSS THE WORLD AND IF WE ARE FACING DEFLATION THEN THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING WE CAN DO WHICH IS TO RUN
INCREASED FISCAL DEFICIT SIDE AND TAX CUTS OR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE INCREASES WHICH ARE OVERTLY AND PERMANENTLY FINANCED WITH CENTRAL BANK MONEY THAT POLICY IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE LESS RISKY THAN THE POLICY OF FOR INSTANCE TAKING INTEREST RATES TO EVER MORE NEGATIVE LEVELS
SO THAT WOULD PUT THE CHANCELLOR ON EXACTLY THE WRONG COURSE AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE'S TRYING TO CUT
GOVERNMENT SPENDING THE CHANCELLOR IS WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE HAS TO FINANCE ALL
OF ATTACKS CARTER OR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE FISCAL DEFICIT WITH DEBT FINANCE WHICH IS INTEREST MARY
AND AS LONG AS YOU LIVE WITHIN THAT CONSTRAINT IT'S LEGITIMATE TO SAY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS DEBT IN THE FUTURE BUT WHAT I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER ACROSS THE WORLD AND I THINK THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO BE CONSIDERED IS JAPAN RATHER THAN THE U.K.
IS THAT THAT CAN STRAIN CAN BE REMOVED AND SHOULD BE REMOVED UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES BY THE ABILITY TO FUND
SOME INCREASE IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REDUCTION IN TAXATION WITH PERMANENT CENTRAL BANK MONEY SO THIS IS WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL HELICOPTER MONEY THIS IS BASICALLY PRINTING MONEY NOT TO GO AND BUY ASSETS OR PUT THEM INTO THIS AND THAT JUST LITERALLY PRINTING MONEY AND SPENDING IT JUST LITERALLY STRAIGHT OFF THE PRESS WHAT DO YOU THINK
O.K. WELL THERE'S THAT ADAIR TURNER'S OBVIOUSLY TAKEN THE EXTREME THERE'S A FEW PARTS BEFORE YOU GET TO TO THAT THAT POSITION BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE POLICY MAKERS NOT BEING OUT OF AMMO IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE VARIOUS THINGS YOU CAN DO GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS ONE OF THEM IF YOU NEED TO KICK START THE ECONOMY AND YOU'VE GOT INTEREST RATES AT THE LOWER BOUND ALL YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING ON INTEREST RATES
BY DEFINITION YOU HAVE TO USE GOVERNMENT SPENDING TO KICK START THE ECONOMY IF YOU DO HELICOPTER MONEY IS THE EXTREME BUT THEY'RE A VARIANCE IN BETWEEN BECAUSE SCUFF OR WOULD YOU SEE THIS IF YOU STARTED DOING THIS THE THE THE DANGEROUS IS THAT YOUR CURRENCY WOULD COLLAPSE IN VALLEY WAS IT THAT'S COS WHICH THE VIA A REPUBLIC TRY HENRY THE EIGHTH DEBASE THE COIN PICTURED THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET A COLLAPSE IN CURRENCY BUT HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME CASES LIKE JAPAN WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS WARRANTED
SO JAPAN OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN IN HAS BEEN IN DEFLATION FOR THE BETTER PART OF TWENTY YEARS THERE ARE THEY'RE ABOUT SO THEY THEY DO NEED TO KICK START AND THEY'VE TRIED THIS IS FAMOUS ABBA NON MIX POLICY WHICH HASN'T REALLY WORKED ON THE SET OF MAGGOTY OWNS QUITE A LOT OF GOVERNMENT DEBTS ARE TO SOME DEGREE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT THEY JUST HAVEN'T REALLY FORMALLY HAVE MISSED IT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
THERE ARE VARIOUS PARTS IN BETWEEN THEM YOU COULD YOU COULD GO THROUGH IT AND INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING PROGRAMME FOR EXAMPLE IN A BILL WITH THAT WOULD IF YOU DID IT BUT IF YOU DID THAT THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO FINANCE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE BONDS WHICH THERE WOULD BE INTEREST BEARING AND THAT WOULD BE DEBT SO YOU PUT UP THE NATIONAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF G.D.P. THAT'S THE THING THAT GEORGE OSBORNE FOR EXAMPLE SAYS HE'S JUST NOT PREPARED TO DO WHAT'S GET THAT COMING DOWN
AND THE MARKETS AND IF THEM IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT WITH THE MARKET SO WE DON'T LIKE THE CREDIT RATING OF THE U.K. OR WOULD THEY SAY ACTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE A PLAN WILL GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WILL YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHICH IS THAT THAT GROWTH HAS SLOWED THE POTENTIALLY IN A WORLD WHICH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STARTS TO GO UP AND YOU THINK ABOUT WILL HOW DO WE GET THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BACK TO WHERE WE WANT IT TO BE
IN THAT WORLD THEN I THINK YOU WOULD SEE GOVERNMENT SPENDING GO UP AND I THINK PEOPLE WOULD WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE IT O.K. WE'RE GETTING OUR MONEY'S WORTH OUT OF YOU TODAY LIKE THEY WANT TO GET YOUR VIEW ON ANOTHER KIND OF BOND OR PERHAPS A BOND WHICH ISN'T REALLY A BOMB THIS IS CALLED A COCOA A CONVERTIBLE CAN CONTINGENT CONVERTIBLE BOND WHICH BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A BOND UNTIL DISASTER BECKONS IN AND IT TURNS INTO SHARES SOME BANKS HAVE GOT THESE AND INVESTORS HAVE TAKEN FRIGHT THEM JUST EXPLAIN
OH KAY SO SO BANKS BORROW MONEY TO TO LEND OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THREE WAYS THEY USE OUR DEPOSITS THEY RAISE EQUITY AND THERE'S A BIT IN THE MIDDLE WHICH STARTS OFF BROADLY SPEAKING LIKE A DEPOSIT AND IF THINGS GO REALLY BADLY WRONG TURNED INTO AN EQUITY NOW WE'VE GOT INTO A WORLD IN WHICH THE EXE MARKET'S BEEN UNDER SEVERE PRESSURE
THERE IS A RISK THAT THESE THINGS MIGHT TURN INTO EQUITY THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT POINT BUT THE MARKETS ARE CERTAINLY SPEAK BY THAT AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S HAD AN IMPACT ON SOME BANK CHET EXACTLY MIKE AMY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TAKE US THROUGH ALL OF THOSE SUBJECTS LET'S MOVE ON TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT A RAY OF LIGHT PERHAPS AMID ALL THIS GROWING MARKET CLAIM ONE OF THOSE LIGHT RAYS OF LIGHT AS THE U.K. TECH SECTOR OR AT LEAST ACCORDING TO A REPORT OUT TODAY FROM TECH CITY U.K. THE GOVERNMENT BACK SCHEME
TO FIND THE NEXT FACEBOOK TWITTER GOOGLE IT SAYS THE SECTOR IS CREATING JOBS THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE U.K. ECONOMY BUT ITS INDUSTRY INDUSTRY'S GROWN BY A THIRD SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN EILEEN BURBIDGE IS CHAIR OF TECH CITY SHE'S ALSO PARTLY IMPASSIONED CAPITAL WHICH HELPS FUND TEXTILE SUCH AS HERE IN THE STEWART GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GIVE US AN UPDATE WHAT'S THAT GIVE US A REPORT CARD ON THE TECH SECTION U. K. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE FLOURISHING AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO THE TECHNICIAN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN POINT THAT WE DID A YEAR AGO AND THIS NUDE TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE CHERRY GROUP NESTER IT'S THE RESULT OF A SERVICE WITH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND DIFFERENT DESTROY BUSINESSES AND LOTS OF INTERVIEWS AS WELL AND AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S SHOWING JUST HOW QUICKLY THE SECTOR'S GROWING AND HOW MUCH IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF JUST G.P. CONTRIBUTION PRODUCTIVITY
AND ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF CLUSTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY SO IT SORT OF HIGHLIGHTED TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS INCLUDING TWENTY SEVEN OBVIOUSLY OUTSIDE OF LONDON AND THE SOUTH EAST WHICH IS WHAT WE THINK WILL PROBABLY SO REFLECT THE GROWTH AND FUTURE I MEET LOTS OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS ON MY BROWN'S RANT ABOUT LOTS OF INTERESTING COMPANIES LOTS OF PASSIONATE DEDICATED PEOPLE
LOTS OF MINNOWS NO BIG FISH WHERE'S THE BRITISH FACEBOOK THE BRITISH GOOGLE U.K. TWITTER STOP WE DON'T HAVE A COMPANY LIKE THAT WHY NOT WE'VE GOT THE LOT OF GREAT COMPANIES ACTUALLY LIKE THAT BUT I THINK WE HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF PROMOTING THEM AND PROBABLY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF FLYING THE FLAG WHICH IS HOPEFULLY WHAT THIS REPORT HELPS TO DO TWO FOR EXAMPLE I AM
WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TECH BUSINESSES OF THE WORLD AND POWERS YOU KNOW EVERY SMARTPHONE THAT ANYONE OF US USES BRITISH BORN AND BRED AND
ONE OF THE BEST SUCCESSES IN THE WORLD I THINK WE JUST NEED TO HAVE MORE AND AS YOU SAY MY MINNOWS BUT THAT WILL CREATE MORE OF A BIG JOINTS AS WELL OH KAY I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS THIS IS NEIL A CO FOUNDER OF INDEX VENTURES A VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM BEHIND THINGS LIKES THE BIG CUPBOARD JUST DEEP BET FOR A OR SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY COME THROUGH HEARS WHAT HE THINKS MAKES AN ATTRACTIVE TECH INVESTMENT
THERE HAS TO BE A BIG MARKET OPPORTUNITY SO THE ENTREPRENEURS HAVE TO BE AMBITIOUS AND DRIVEN TO GO UP TO SOMETHING BIG AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE CHARISMATIC INTERESTING FOUNDERS WHO WE BELIEVE
KEN ATTRACT A TEAM TO WORK WITH THE ABLE TO RAISE THE MONEY THAT THEY'LL NEED TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESS AND CONVINCED PEOPLE AND CUSTOMERS TO TRY THEIR PRODUCT IT'S INTERESTING THAT ISN'T IT COS IT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MINDSET RATHER THAN A SKILL SET THAT YOU NEED YEAH IT IS
I LIKE TO SEE THAT IDEAS ARE CHEAP YOU REALLY NEED THE WHEREWITHAL TO REALISE IT AND PART OF THAT IS JUST REAL DEDICATION AND PASSION I'M PART OF THAT IS THEIR SKILLS TO LEAD
IS THAT TRUE IT'S ALL ABOUT SELLING YOURSELF FRILLY EITHER HAVE THE CLEVEREST IDEA IN THE WORLD BUT IT'S HAVING A CERTAIN MINDSET OF CERTAIN BRAVURA CERTAIN APPROACH THAT GETS IT GETS PEOPLE TO INVEST IN YOU I MEAN I THINK IDEALLY AT BOTH BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS NOT BEING THE FIRST MARKET NOT BEING UNIQUE GOOGLE CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST SO CHILDREN APPLE WAS NOT THE FIRST TO DO A SMARTPHONE BUT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY GREAT ABOUT WHAT THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE AND TECHNICIAN TWENTY SIXTEEN
IS THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COME TO THIS SECTOR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COMING WITH A CASE COMING IN COS YOU SAY ENGINEER IN AMERICA IT MEANS SOFTWARE ENGINEER IT'S DEAD YOU SAY ENGINEER IN THIS COUNTRY IT MEANS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IT'S CALLED TO ME EVEN BEING IN THIS COUNTRY BUT YES WE PROBABLY NEED TO CHANGE THE PILOTS A LITTLE BIT OR WE CAN TALK TO TALK ABOUT THE MOST SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS I THINK THE SEMANTICS ASIDE WHAT'S REALLY GREAT IS THAT WE'RE SEEING DIFFERENT QUESTIONS COME UP WE'RE SEEING IN A FINANCIAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE IN LONDON ATTRACTING A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION SO YOU'VE GOT
BASICALLY THE BIGGEST FIN TECH CAPITAL OUR CENTRE OF THE WORLD IS IN ROBOTICS IN BRISTOL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN CAMBRIDGE KNOW EVEN SOMETHING LIKE GAMING IN NEWCASTLE SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC SKILL SET AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SECTOR THAT'S REALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE U.K. ECONOMY AND IN BURBAGE MANY THANKS

DOCTORS LEADERS HAVE REJECTED A FINAL TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OFFER MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE THE BITTER CONTRACT DISPUTE IN ENGLAND THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED A DEAL ON SATURDAY PAY BUT THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SAID THE OFFER WAS NOT SUBSTANTIAL OR FAIR IT'S EXPECTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEADLOCK MINISTERS WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THE NEW CONTRACT WILL BE IMPOSED ON THE DOCTORS
A REPORT IS WARNING THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS FACING GROWING PRESSURE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCE DURING THE WINTER IN RECENT YEARS THE STUDY BY TWO LEADING HEALTH CHARITIES ALSO INDICATES THAT LAST WINTER WAS THE TOUGHEST ON RECORD
SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES HAVE STARTED WITHDRAWING THEIR STAFF FROM AN INDUSTRIAL PARK IN NORTH KOREA WHICH IS JOINTLY RUN BY THE TWO COUNTRIES SO THIS WHOLE HALTING OPERATIONS IN THE GUESS UN COMPLEX AFTER THE NORTH CARRIED OUT A NUCLEAR TEST AND FIRED A LONG RANGE MISSILE
TWO MORE CANDIDATES HAVE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HEWLETT PACKARD CAR BEEFY ARENA HAVE WITHDRAWN AFTER POOR RESULTS IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
A STUDY HAS REVEALED THAT THE AVERAGE SALARY OF A UNIVERSITY VICE CHANCELLOR NOW STANDS AT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND UP BY AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS ON LAST YEAR THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION WHICH CARRIED OUT THE RESEARCH SAYS VICE CHANCELLORS ARE ACCEPTING LARGE PAY RISES AND PERKS WHILE STAFF SALARIES REMAIN STAGNANT THE BODY REPRESENTING UNIVERSITIES THERE PAID IN LINE WITH THE HEADS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT COULD IMPOSE ITS NEW CONTRACT ON DOCTORS IN ENGLAND AS EARLY EARLIEST TODAY JUNIOR DOCTORS REJECTED THE FINAL TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OFFER FROM THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY AND SETTLE A BIT A CONTRACT DISPUTE IN ENGLAND SO IF HE HUTCHISON IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT AND SOPHIE WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO NOW
THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE THE END OF THE ROAD FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND JUNIOR DOCTORS THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SIR DAVID DOULTON HAS MADE THIS FINAL OFFER SUE DOCTORS AT THE B.M.A. IN A LETTER
HE SAID TO THEM THAT THEY HAD UNTIL THREE P.M. YESTERDAY TO ACCEPT THE OFFER OR HE WOULD CONSIDER A NEGOTIATED DEAL UNACHIEVABLE AND HE SAID IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE TO OFFER HER NEXT AN EXTENSION TO THAT DEADLINE AND THAT IF NO AGREEMENT WAS GIVEN HE WOULD ADVISE THE HEALTH SECRETARY THAT NEGOTIATIONS WOULD FAIL NOW WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE B.M.A. THAT THEY HAVE REJECTED THIS OFFER WHAT NOW HAPPENS IS THAT WERE EXPECTING SIR DAVID DOULTON TO WRITE THAT LETTER TO
THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT AND SAY THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED AND THAT THEN OPENS THE DOOR FOR MY HUNT TO SAY HE WILL IMPOSE A CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS NOT IMMEDIATELY
HE'S ABLE TO DO THAT AS SOON AS HE HAS THIS UNDERTAKING FROM SIR DAVID DOULTON THE CONTRACTS NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE IN THE SUMMER AND BECAUSE THE N.H.S. IS SUCH AN ENORMOUS MACHINE PLANNING ONCE THE CONTRACT IS IN PLACE
THE DEADLINE FOR THOSE PREPARATIONS WAS MEANT TO HAVE BEEN WELL IT IS MEANT TO BE THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY SO THAT'S NEXT WEEK SO THERE HAS BEEN THIS REAL PUSH TO GET A NEW CONTRACT IN PLACE TO MAKE THOSE PREPARATIONS AND IT IS ONE'S JUST WONDER ABOUT THE PRACTICALITIES OF IMPOSING IT THE THE EMPLOYERS WITHIN THE N.H.S. CAN JIT AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN JUST SAY LOOK THESE ARE THE NEW TERMS UNDER WHICH YOUR WORK
THAT'S RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS WITH DOCTORS IS THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT THAT LASTS ROUGHLY A YEAR SO NEW DOCTORS WILL COME ON LINE IN AUGUST WHO HAVE RECENTLY QUALIFIED
THOSE DOCTORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM ALSO NEED TO HAVE THEIR CONTRACTS RENEWED SO THE HEALTH SECRETARY CAN SAY TO THE HEADS OF N.H.S. TRUSTS THIS IS THE NEW CONTRACT FOR YOUR DOCTORS
YOU NEED THAT WE ARE NOW IMPOSING IT ON THOSE DOCTORS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY OBVIOUSLY HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT AND THE B.M.A. DOES HAVE A MANDATE TO HAVE MORE STRIKES IF IT WANTS TO
WHETHER THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO THAT IT IS THE BIG QUESTION SO IF YOU HUTCHISON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MOST SENIOR POLICE OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY SUGGESTED THE POLICE SHOULD ADOPT A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHEN ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND MADE OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS DOWN ARE YOU SURE THIS IS IMPORTANT DANNY THIS IS SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE COMMISSIONER OF THE MET
YES I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SHIFT HE WAS TALKING AFTER SETTING UP A REVIEW INTO OPERATION MIDLAND ANOTHER HIGH PROFILE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING HISTORICAL SEXUAL ABUSE ALLEGATIONS AND WHAT HE SUGGESTED LAST NIGHT AT THE BRIAN REDHEAD LECTURE AT THE B. B. C. IN SALFORD
IS THAT THE OFFICER WHO IN THAT INQUIRY INITIALLY SAID THAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE TRUE AND CREDIBLE HAD MIS SPOKEN BECAUSE HE'D BECOME CONFUSED BY ALL THE GUIDANCE THAT'S OUT THERE FOR POLICE WHICH SAYS THAT VICTIMS WILL BE BELIEVED HE SAID THAT WE NEED TO FORMULATE A NEW APPROACH WHERE BY OFFICERS SHOW EMPATHY TOWARDS THE ALLEGED VICTIMS BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND
AS THEY THEN SEEK TO VERIFY THE ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE MADE NOW THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE GUIDANCE THAT'S ON THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT FROM THE INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY TWENTY FOURTEEN TEAM SAID THE VICTIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE BELIEVED SO WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT GOING TO MAKE FROM NOW ON
I MEAN THIS IS SIR BERNARD SETTING OUT WHAT HE THINKS THE NEW APPROACH SHOULD BE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I EXPECT THAT THE REVIEW BY SIR RICHARD ENRICO IS WE'LL LOOK AT
GOING FORWARD TO RICHARD IN BECAUSE THAT'S RIGHT THE RETIRED JUDGE HE'S CONDUCTING A REVIEW OF MIDDLE AND THE OTHER ENQUIRIES SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING IT'S NECESSARILY BEEN IN A BLANKET ACCEPTED BY ALL POLICE FORCES BUT IT IS SIGNALLING THAT PERHAPS THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR THAT CERTAINLY I THINK WHAT'S SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS SUGGESTING I'M GOING TO MISS ONE TOO FAR IN BELIEVING VICTIMS
AND HE SAID THE PROBLEM WITH THAT APPROACH IS THAT WHEN YOU THEN COME TO SPEAK TO THE SUSPECT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE ARE BEING OBJECTIVE AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THE POLICE MAINTAIN THAT THAT IMPARTIALITY THAT YOU TRAVIS HE ACCEPTING THAT HIS FORCE AND HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FORCE OBVIOUSLY HAS DONE ANYTHING WRONG
I DON'T THINK HE'S SAYING THAT THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG IN RESPECT OF THESE RECENT CLAIMS THE THESE RECENT INVESTIGATIONS OTHER THAN THE THE APOLOGY THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY SUIT TO THE THE WIDOW OF LORD BRITAIN FOR DELAYING TELLING HER THAT NO CHARGES WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST BRITAIN HAD HE BEEN ALIVE IN RESPECT OF A RAPE ALLEGATION HE'S WAITING FOR THE REVIEW REALLY TO TELL THEM BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THINGS THEY MAY HAVE DONE WRONG AND ALSO WHAT THINGS THEY MAY HAVE DONE RIGHT
BUT I THINK THIS IS IT ACCEPTANCE THAT THE POLICE REALLY NEED SOME HELP TO RESET THE COMPASS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY GO FORWARD WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND IT IS A DIFFICULT DIFFICULT ISSUE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE AND I THINKS A BIRD IS SAYING AN INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE MIND IS NEEDED TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH THAT IN FUTURE AND WE'LL BE TALKING TO SIR BERNARD AT TEN PAST EIGHT THANKS DANNY
IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE LAST FEW MEMBERS OF A RIGHT WING MILITIA WHO'VE BEEN OCCUPYING A WILDLIFE REFUGE IN OREGON SAY THEY WILL SURRENDER IN THE MORNING ACCORDING TO ONE OF THOSE WHO'S STILL HOLED UP INSIDE THE BUILDING THE F.B.I. HAS CLOSED IN SURROUNDING THEM TRYING TO BRING AN END TO THE FORTY DAYS SIEGE SEAN ANDERSON IS ONE OF THE FOUR WHO WERE STILL LEFT INSIDE
OH I CAN'T COME ON JAMES COOK IS A NORTH AMERICA CORRESPONDENT AND JAMES THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE SIGNIFICANT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE F.B.I. AND THOSE LAST FEW REMAINING MEMBERS INSIDE THAT'S RIGHT FORCE STILL LEFT SARAH AND JUST EXPLAIN WHO HE WAS REFERRING TO IN THAT CONVERSATION IT WAS SLIGHTLY SURREAL LIVE BROADCAST ALIVE LIVE STREAM ON THE WEB

PRESENT IN THE MORNING THEY SAY THEY'LL PUT DOWN THEIR WEAPONS TO DO SO THAT LIVE STREAM WAS A MIXTURE OF PRAYER AND PARANOIA IT JUST ENDED ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AGO AND THE FOUR REMAINING THERE SAID THEY WERE GOING TO GET SOME SLEEP BEFORE COMING OUT IN THE MORNING THIS HAS BEEN DRAGGING ON SINCE THE TURN OF THE YEAR WHEN THE MILITIA
TOOK OVER THIS BY HAD RESERVE WHICH IS HIGH ON THE PLAINS THE SNOWY DESERT OF RURAL OREGON INITIALLY COMPLAINING ABOUT THE IMPRISONMENT OF TWO LOCAL RANCHERS BUT IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT THEIR BEEF WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE U.S. WAS MORE WIDE RANGING THEY WERE ACCUSING THE WASHINGTON OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL INTERFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES OF RANCHERS IN THE WESTERN STATES THAT THE END OF LAST MONTH THE LEADERS OF THE OCCUPATION LEFT IN TWO VEHICLES TO GO TO A PUBLIC MEETING THE POLICE AND F.B.I. INTERCEPTED THEM
ALL BUT ONE OF THEM GAVE UP PEACEFULLY AT ONE OF THEM LOVE OI FINN OR COME WHO HAD BEEN A SPOKESMAN FOR THE GROUP WAS SHOT DEAD THE F.B.I. SAY HE WAS GOING FOR A GUN SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS DISPUTE THAT BUT BASICALLY THEN DWINDLED MOST OF THEM SURRENDERED ONLY FOUR REMAINED AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE NOW ENTERING THE END GAME ALTHOUGH JUST ONE NOTE OF CAUTION ONE OF THE FOUR DID SOME PRETTY VOLATILE IN THAT CALL JAMES COOK THANKS VERY MUCH
NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVER LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THEY KEEPING UP THE PRESSURE ON THE HEAD OF SCOTLAND YARD TO BERNARD HOGAN HOWE TO APOLOGISE TO LORD BRAMALL FOR THE WAY THE MET HANDLE CLAIMS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AGAINST HIM AND JUST SAY SORRY THAT IS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN AND STILL HE WON'T SAY SORRY THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAIL MAIL SAYS IT IS SICKENINGLY TYPICAL THAT SIR BERNARD IS HOLDING A REVIEW OF THE INVESTIGATION IN SECRET HOW CAN HE CLEAR THE AIR HE'D ARSE WITHOUT LETTING IN THE LIGHT
THE TIMES CARRIES A STILL FROM A VIDEO OF WHAT IT SAYS IS A FOUR YEAR OLD BRITISH BOY DETONATING A CAR BOMB IN TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN SYRIA THE BOMB APPEARS TO HAVE KILLED THREE MEN I S. CLAIMED IT WAS SPIES THE PAPER SAYS THE BOY HAS SPENT ALMOST ALL HIS LIFE IN THE CLUTCHES OF I S. AFTER HIS MOTHER TOOK HIM FROM LONDON TO JOIN THE JIHADIS IN SYRIA ACCORDING TO THE SOUND THE BOY'S PICTURE APPARENTLY PRESSING A DETONATOR AND HIS HAND TO SET OFF THE DEVICE IT SAYS THE FOUR YEAR OLD IS THEN SEEN GRINNING PROUDLY NEXT TO THE BURNING CAR
HUMILIATION OF HILARY THAT IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL TO DESCRIBE HILARY CLINTON'S CRUSHING DEFEAT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE MAIL DESCRIBES HER TRIUMPHANT OPPONENT BERNIE SANDERS AS THE AMERICAN CORBIN
THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THE OUTCOME FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS REPRESENTED THE STUNNING SEISMIC EXPRESSION VOTED DISGUST WITH BOTH MAJOR PARTIES THE TIMES CLAIMED THIS MORNING THAT YOU KIP KNOWINGLY ALLOWED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO STAND FOR ELECTION LAST MAY WHO HAD VIOLENT PAST THE PAPER QUOTES PARTY SPOKESMAN SAYING THE NAME SHOULD HAVE RAISED WHAT HE CALLED A RED FLAG AND MANY OF THE BACK PAGES ACKNOWLEDGED THE INFLUENCE OF LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL FANS IN THE DECISION BY THE CLUB TO ABANDON A BIG INCREASE IN TICKET PRICES VICTORY IS THE HEADLINE
ON THE BACK PAGE OF THE MIRROR CLIMB DOWN THERE IN THE MAIL THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THE CLUB'S HIERARCHY HAD BEEN AN EMERGENCY TALKS IN SATURDAY EVENING THEY WERE RATTLED AND APPALLED BY THE MASS WALKOUT BY FANS DURING A HOME GAME AT ANFIELD EARLIER THAT DAY THE SPORT SESSION HAS A FRONT PAGE PICTURE OF THE KOP IN FULL CRY ACCOMPANIED BY TWO SIMPLE WORDS PEOPLE POWER
IT'S NOW IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN JUST TAKEN OUR MENUS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE PRESUMPTION THE SEX ABUSE COMPLAINTS ARE TELLING THE TRUTH HE'S LIKELY TO BE DROPPED AS PART OF A REVIEW OF THE WAY HISTORICAL ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN HANDLED BY THE METROPOLITAN POLICE NOW HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF YOUR M.P. HAS BEEN ARRESTED EVEN IF HE OR SHE IS NEVER CHARGED
LAST NIGHT M.P.S APPROVED A NEW RULES WHICH MEANS THAT IN FUTURE POLITICIANS WHO ARE ARRESTED WILL NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY NAMED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AS THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT JOHN
THERE'D BEEN PLENTY OF PUBLICITY AHEAD OF LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE MOST OF IT BAD THERE WERE HEADLINES COMPLAINING THAT POLITICIANS WERE DEMANDING SECRECY AND ACCUSING THEM OF TRYING TO HIDE THE FACT THAT THEY'D BEEN ARRESTED FROM THE VOTERS
AND IT HADN'T GONE UNNOTICED THAT THE MOTION PROPOSING THE CHANGE BECAUSE THE CURRENT LAWS FELL FOUL OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING A LEADING CRITIC OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT
MY CRAVING WASN'T THERE FOR THE DEBATE BUT HIS DEPUTY THERESE COFFEE WAS IN HER PLACE
I DO NOT INTEND TO DETAIN THE HOUSE FOR A LONG WHILE I WOULD DESCRIBE MYSELF OR MY OWN BOYFRIEND FOR FINCHLEY AS CONVICTION POLITICIANS I WANT THE RECORD TO SHOW THAT THE MOTION BEFORE THE HOUSE RESULTS FROM THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT FROM THE PROCEDURE COMMITTEE ON THE FIFTEENTH OF DECEMBER
JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT THOSE PUNS MIGHT HAVE CREPT INTO DOCTOR COFFEE SPEECH BY MISTAKE A WORD OF CAUTION SO HONOURABLE MEN
THE PROPOSALS ACTUALLY CAME FROM ACROSS PARTY COMMITTEE OF M.P.S AND NOT THE GOVERNMENT UP UNTIL NOW THE RULE BIN THAT THE SPEAKER MUST PUBLISH THE NEWS OF AN M.P.'S ARREST THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE PROCEDURE COMMITTEE CHARLES WALKER INSISTED THAT THE CRITICS HAD GOT HOLD OF THE WRONG END OF THE STICK AND THE CHANGES WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT M.P.S WERE TREATED JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS HOUSE IN MATTERS OF POLICING AND PUBLIC ORDER THE POINT OF PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OCCURS NOT AT THE POINT OF CHARGE
AS IS THE CASE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT AT THE POINT OF ARREST
MISTER SPEAKER THIS PROCESS OF NOTIFICATION PUTS THE POLICE AND THE HOUSE AT ODDS WITH THE DATA PROTECTION ACT AND POTENTIALLY ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS
A FELLOW CONSERVATIVE JACOB REES MOGG THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE TIMES WHEN AN M.P. WOULD WANT PUBLICITY IN THE UNLIKELY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A GOVERNMENT LESS BENIGN THAN THE CURRENT ONE WERE TO ARREST A MEMBER ON A TRUMPED UP CHARGE WOULD THAT REMEMBER I HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSIST BUT MISTER SPEAKER BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE HOUSE FROM THE LABOUR FRONT BENCH MELANIE ON WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE ARREST OF AN M. P. SECRET IN THE AGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA
AND ON THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA REENA'S VERY OFTEN TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN AND BECOME WIDELY ACCEPTED TRUTH BEFORE THE INTERESTED PARTY HAS A CHANCE TO RESPOND
WOULD HE CONSIDER THAT THERE IS A RISK WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE DUTY TO NOTIFY IF THE ARREST OF MEMBERS TO THE HOUSE THAT IT COULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO COUNTER RUMOURS OF SUCH ARREST
AN S.N.P. MEMBER OF THE PROCEDURE COMMITTEE PATRICK GRADY SAID THE CHANGE WAS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT MODERNISATION
WHAT WAS STRIKING TO DO WHAT THE REPORTS EIGHT SEEKS TO DO IS STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE HISTORIC RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES ACCORDED TO THIS HOUSE AND THE UNDERSTOOD MODERN RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE SPECIALLY THAT RIGHT TO PRIVACY
THE LABOUR M.P. JOHN MAN BROKE THE CONSENSUS AND COMPLAINED THAT CHRIS GRAYLING WANTED TO SCRAP THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT SO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
NO HUMAN RIGHTS MY CONSTITUENTS CAN HAVE NO HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WILL CREATE SOME EXTRA WORLD
TONIGHT FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT
ARE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IT SAY
THAT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT I'LL GIVE THEMSELVES SOME SPECIAL RIGHT
A CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF THE PROCEDURE COMMITTEE SIR EDWARD LEE DISAGREED
A PRIVILEGE OF ANY SORT IS BEING GIVEN TO ANY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
WE ARE BEING PUT ON EXACTLY THE SAME LEVEL AS MEMBERS OF THE PARK
THE CHANGES WERE APPROVED WITHOUT A VOTE BUT NOT BEFORE THE LABOUR M.P. DENNIS SKINNER HAD DECLARED HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT AS HE RECALLED THE DAY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED AFTER HE'D JOINED PICKET OUTSIDE T. V. A.
AND THEN AFTER THREE HOURS AND I'M THINKING I'M GOING TO MISS BRA QUESTION TIME A MAN CAME IN WITH ALL THESE PIPS ON HIS SHOULDER AND HE SAYS IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU
I SAID I'M TRYING TO GET OUT TO GET TO PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTION TIME OF ALL STRUGGLING WITH THIRTEEN OF COURSE IN THE GUARDIAN
AS WELL AS A READER OF THE SAWN YOU'LL PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
SO HE'D TAKE ME IN AND ALL THE TEA YOU WOW
HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT THE CROSSWORD CLUE WAS PERHAPS HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN ANAGRAM OF RETREAD
AN ANAGRAM OF IS THE ANSWER ARRESTED SEAN CURRAN REPORTING THERE MORE ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE TIME NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IF SOMEONE ACCUSED OF AN OFFENCE IN ENGLAND AND WALES PLEADS GUILTY STRAIGHTAWAY THEN THEIR SENTENCE COULD BE CUT BY A THIRD
THAT'S EVEN IF THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM IS OVERWHELMING THE PROPOSAL COMES FROM THE SENTENCING COUNCIL AND WE'RE JOINED BY ITS CHAIRMAN LORD JUSTICE TRACY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT IS THERE THINK ABOUT THIS CHANGE COS IT IS A SLIGHT CHANGE FROM THE EXISTING GUIDELINES YES IT'S A TIGHTENING UP OF THE EXISTING GUIDELINES SO THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR A DEFENDER TO GET THAT AN OFFENDER TO GET THAT SORT OF CREDIT IS THAT THEY PLEAD GUILTY AT THE FIRST COURT APPEARANCE
IT WILL PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO VICTIMS AND WITNESSES WHO VERY OFTEN FEAR THE ORDEAL WITH THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT ADMIT GUILT OF HAVING TO GO TO COURT AND RELIVING THEIR EXPERIENCES AND TRIAL AND WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THE ARGUMENT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT THE PRESSURE ON SOMEBODY AT THE VERY EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY TO PLEAD GUILTY BECAUSE ACTUALLY YOU'RE CHANGING IT IF IT IF THEY PLEAD GUILTY TO A LATER DATE IF THEY DON'T TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLEAD GUILTY AT THAT FIRST APPEARANCE THERE
AMOUNT OF REDUCTION THAT THEY CAN GET REDUCES VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IT GOES DOWN TO TWENTY PER CENT FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND THEN GOES DOWN AGAIN FROM TWENTY PERCENT TO ZERO IF THEY DON'T PLEAD GUILTY AT ALL
ONE OF THE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS THAT YOU'RE REMOVING THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGES IN CASES AND THEY SURELY THEY ARGUMENT FOR DISCRETION IS THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT THE PARTICULARS OF THE CASE AND SAY WELL HE DID THIS PARTICULAR THING OR YOU DID THIS AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THIS WELL THIS IS AN OLD ARGUMENT BUT JUDGES ARE USED TO WORKING WITH GUIDELINES
AND WHAT'S THE GUIDELINES PROVIDE IN THIS INSTANCE IS CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY SO EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE THEY STAND DEFENDANTS AND THEIR LAWYERS WILL KNOW THAT IF THEY OWN UP RIGHT AT THE START THEY WILL THEY WILL GET THERE ONE THIRD DISCOUNT IF THAT HAPPENS IT FREES UP THE COURTS TO DEAL WITH OTHER CASES IT FREES UP THE PROSECUTION AND THE POLICE TO INVESTIGATE AND WORK ON OTHER CASES
AND SO THERE ARE BENEFITS NOT ONLY FOR THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES BUT BENEFITS FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF
AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE CERTAINTY AND CONSISTENCY THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL BRING ABOUT WILL BE BENEFICIAL BUT IN TERMS OF JUSTICE BECAUSE IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IT IS DRIVEN IN PART BY FINANCES THAT YOU'RE ALMOST OR YOU'RE IN DANGER OF BEING SEEN AS REWARDING THOSE WHO HAVE DONE SOMETHING WHERE THERE MAY BE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AND IT MAY BE OBVIOUS THAT IF IT WENT TO TRIAL AT THAT
AT A LATER DATE THAT THEY WOULD BE BANGED UP WELL IT'S TRUE THAT THEY WILL GET A REDUCTION IN SENTENCE BUT PARLIAMENT HAS PROVIDED THAT THE COURT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT A PERSON HAS PLEADED GUILTY THAT'S BEEN THE LAW FOR VERY MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN WELL ACCEPTED AND IT'S NOT JUST IN THE COURTS AT THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS YOU REMEMBER FROM YOUR SCHOOL DAYS THAT THE TEACHER SAID WELL IF YOU OWN UP TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE WRONG THE THE IMPLICATION WAS YOU'D BE DEALT WITH MORE LENIENTLY THAN IF YOU BRAZEN IT OUT SO
IT'S IT'S LIFE INDEED AND THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE THE BIT MARK FENNER WHOLE WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CRIMINAL BAR ASSOCIATION MAKES THE POINT THAT GUIDELINES MUST NOT BECOME STRAIGHT JACKETS TO PREVENT JUDGES FROM MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION IN INDIVIDUAL CASES SEX EXCEPT THE PRINCIPLE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT MAKES THE POINT
DON'T GO TOO FAR YES WELL IT'S WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PHRASE IS THAT THEIR GUIDELINES NOT TRAMLINES AND EVERY JUDGE KNOWS THAT EVERY LAWYER KNOWS THAT AND INDEED BUILT INTO EVERY GUIDELINE IS THE PROVISO THAT THE JUDGE SHOULD NOT APPLY THE GUIDELINE IF IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE IN THE INDIVIDUAL CASE TO APPLY SO THERE'S ALWAYS THAT SAFETY VALVE WHICH ENABLES JUSTICE TO BE DONE
NO JUSTICE TRACY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE LATEST N.H.S. PERFORMANCE FIGURES OUT TODAY ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SURPRISED BY THIS A HEALTH SYSTEM UNDER GREAT STRAIN ALONG WITH THE USUAL DATA FOR A.&E. WAITING TIMES AND SO ON THIS ONE MEASURE
IT'LL WILL BE CAREFULLY LOOK AT DELAYED DISCHARGES IN OTHER WORDS THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO ARE WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HOSPITAL BUT COULDN'T AND MOSTLY THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS ARRANGING THE CARE AT HOME OR A PLACE IN A NURSING HOME OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC YOU SPENT A DAY AT WIGAN INFIRMARY
WIGAN INFIRMARY STAND THIS WALL ON A BUSY WEDNESDAY MORNING
O.K. ALMOST EVERY BED HERE IS OCCUPIED BY AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHAT ARE KNOWN AS THE FRAIL ELDERLY MAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO ARE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BUT ADMITTING THEM IS ONE THING GETTING THEM DISCHARGED AND HOME IS QUITE ANOTHER
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE TODAY WE'VE GOT THIRTY ONE DELAYED WHICH IS A FULL WHY
SHOULDN'T THAT MEDICALLY FIT TO LEAVE HOSPITAL THIRTY ONE DIFFERENT THIRTY ONE DIFFERENT PEOPLE YEAH NURSE KAREN ATKINSON RUNS A TEAM THAT TRIES TO ENSURE PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED AS SOON AS IT'S SAFE TO DO SO THE TECHNICAL TERM IS MEDICALLY FIT FOR DISCHARGE MEANS PATIENTS MIGHT STILL NEED LOOKING AFTER JUST NOT WITH THE HIGH LEVELS OF CARE FOUND IN A HOSPITAL
THIS CARE CAN BE PROVIDED IN ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY DADS BUT AT THE MOMENT WE ONLY HAVE FIVE MEANS BEDS WHICH ARE ATTACHED TO THE HOSPITAL AT THE MOMENT THOSE BETS ARE FULL SO THEY'RE PATIENTS DO REMAIN IN HOSPITAL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DISCHARGE THEM UP IN THE HOSPITAL AND YOU RUN INTO THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS ABOUT SHORTAGE OF BEDS FOR EXAMPLE
HOW MUCH IS THAT IS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PARROTS
IT'S NOT WITHIN THE HOSPITAL PARROTS SOLVE AT ALL WAS LACK OF BEDS OUT THERE FOR PATIENTS AND RELATIVES TO LOOK FOR AT THE MOMENT UNLESS WE BUILD OTHER HOMES THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THESE PATIENTS
SO NOW I'M ON SHERRINGTON WARD WHERE MOST OF THE PATIENTS ARE ELDERLY WOMEN I'M ABOUT TO MEET BERYL THORNTON HE'S EIGHTY TWO AND WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON THE SECOND OF JANUARY MORE THAN A MONTH AGO NOT SURPRISINGLY SHE'S DESPERATE TO GO
I JUST WISH THAT THINGS CAN PULL THEIR FINGER OUT HE MUST BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR YOU IF YOU THINK YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH FOR US TRUE WHEN THEY KNOW I'M READY TO GO
I'VE GOT A BED IN THE LOUNGE READY TO MOVE IN TO
AND OF COURSE YOU YOU'D MUCH RATHER BE AT HOME I GUESS DEFINITELY AND YOU'RE BETTER IN BED ANYWAY
WHAT'S THE ISSUE WITH BERYL WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO GET HER HOME
DIFFICULT WITH TRYING TO GET BARREL HOME THERE WAS TRY AND SCARE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT IN PLACE FOR BERYL TO RETURN HOME GET SOCIAL CARE TO PUT IN THEIR PACKAGE OF CARE
TO MEET HER NEEDS WHEN SHE GETS HOME SO THEREFORE THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ENCOUNTER EVERY DAY THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY AND HOW HEAT WHICH LOCAL ORGANISATION FROM HEALTH AND SOCIAL
THEREFORE WE HAVE DIFFICULTY TRYING TO GET PEOPLE REPATRIATED BACK TO THEIR OWN
ALMOST EVERY HOSPITAL TRUST IS STRUGGLING WITH DELAYS IN DISCHARGING PATIENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OLDER PATIENTS LIKE BERYL COPING WITH COMPLEX HEALTH
IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IT'S A RELATIVELY QUIET MORNING A GOOD THING TOO CONSIDERING HOW FULL OF WATER WITH PATIENTS STILL TO BE DISCHARGED AS DOCTOR KURT ELAINE'S AVE EXPLAINS THE CONSEQUENCES OF DELAYS IN SENDING PATIENTS HOME ARE FELT MOST CAN
WHAT HAPPENS AS WE DEVELOP OR HERE WHAT HERE WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN EXIT BLOCK FOR THE BEIGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY GET FRUSTRATED RATING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BEDS AVAILABLE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR PATIENTS
THIS IS ONE REASON WHY FOR MONTHS NOW ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE U.K. HAVE STRUGGLED TO MEET THE FOUR HOUR TARGET FOR TREATING PATIENTS THE TEAM AT WIGAN IS TRYING TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL COUNCIL'S SOCIAL SERVICES CARE HOME OPERATORS AND CHARITIES TO ENSURE PATIENTS CAN BE DISCHARGED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT IT'S FIERCELY COMPLICATED
MEANWHILE EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD BERYL FORMED AND IS FRUSTRATED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE'S WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE AND YET HE'S STUCK DOING ANY GOOD IN HERE ANY WAY SORRY MY MUM THIS
WHEREAS I CAN BE A BED AND COMFORTABLE AND SURROUNDED BY YOUR OWN FRIENDS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS BUT NO IT'S SOMEBODY WANTS IS A DOOR

UNION LEADERS HAVE REJECTED WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A FINAL OFFER IN THE DISPUTE OVER JUNIOR DOCTORS PAY AND CONDITIONS IN ENGLAND MAKING IT LIKELY THAT A NEW CONTRACT WILL BE IMPOSED AND A SURVEY OF UNIVERSITIES IN THE U.K. SUGGEST THAT THE AVERAGE SALARY FOR THE VICE CHANCELLOR IS NOW MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND POUNDS TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE POLICE SHOULD CHANGE THEIR APPROACH TO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND NOT AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE COMPLAINANT IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE POLICY WILL BE LOOKED AT DURING THE REVIEW ANNOUNCED BY SIR BERNARD YESTERDAY OF OPERATION MIDLAND AND OTHER SCOTLAND YARD INQUIRIES INTO CLAIMS OF HISTORICAL ABUSE BY PUBLIC FIGURES
A FORMER JUDGE SIR RICHARD HENRY KISS WILL CONDUCT THE REVIEW HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
MUCH OF THE CRITICISM OF OPERATION MIDLAND HAS REVOLVED AROUND THE COMMENTS OF A SENIOR DETECTIVE NEAR THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION HE DESCRIBED THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND MURDER MADE BY A MAN KNOWN AS NICK AS CREDIBLE AND TRUE
SPEAKING LAST NIGHT IT HAD B. B. C. EVENT SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOUSE AT THE OFFICER HAD MIS SPOKEN AFTER BECOMING CONFUSED BY THE NEED TO FOLLOW GUIDANCE EMPHASISING THE COMPLAINANTS MUST BE BELIEVED THE MET COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS TIME TO RISK FORMULATE THAT APPROACH SO PLEASE SHOWED EMPATHY TOWARDS VICTIMS BUT RETAINED AN OPEN MIND AS THEY TRY TO VERIFY THE ALLEGATIONS MADE
SIR BERNARD ALSO DEFENDED HIS DECISION NOT TO SAY SORRY TO THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY LORD BRAMALL WHO WAS INVESTIGATED AS PART OF OPERATION MIDLAND THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D SPENT FOUR YEARS APOLOGISING FOR THINGS HE DONE BUT IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE TO DO SO SIMPLY FOR CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION
MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONFIRM TODAY OR TOMORROW THEY WILL IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND A SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE BY THE DOCTOR'S PART OF THEIR LONG RUNNING DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER PAY AND WEEKEND WORKING ENDS IN AN HOUR'S TIME LAST NIGHT IT EMERGED THAT THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAD REJECTED WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SIR DAVID DOULTON DESCRIBED AS A FINAL OFFER
DAVID'S NOW EXPECTED TO TELL THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT THERE'S NO REALISTIC PROSPECT OF A DEAL MORE DETAILS FROM OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE END OF THE ROAD FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT SIR DAVID DOULTON WHO REPRESENTS MINISTERS SET A DEADLINE OF THREE P.M. YESTERDAY FOR THE DOCTORS' UNION TO AGREE TO THIS FINAL OFFER IT ADDRESSED THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF SATURDAY WORKING PROPOSING A PREMIUM RATE OF PAY FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS WORKING NOT ONE IN THREE WEEKENDS AS PREVIOUSLY BUT ONE IN FOUR
HE SAID THIS WOULD MEAN MOST TRAINEE DOCTORS WHO WORKED AT THE WEEKEND WOULD GET THE PREMIUM RATE IT ALSO INCREASED FINES FOR N.H.S. TRUSTS WHICH MAKE DOCTORS WORK MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS BUT THE B.M.A. HAS NOT AGREED TO THE TERMS LAST NIGHT IT TOLD THE B. B. C. THE OFFER WAS TINKERING NOT SUBSTANTIAL AND NOT FAIR
SIR DAVID DOULTON IS NOW EXPECTED TO SEND HIS FORMAL ADVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED JUNIOR DOCTORS IT SEEMS ARE NOW ON THE BRINK OF HAVING A NEW CONTRACT IMPOSED ON THEM
FIGURES ON HOW THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND COPED IN DECEMBER BEING PUBLISHED LATER THIS MORNING ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW IT REMAINS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE A REPORT BY TWO LEADING CHARITIES THE NUFFIELD TRUST AND THEIR HEALTH FOUNDATION SINCE LAST WINTER WAS THE TOUGHEST ON RECORD AND WARNS THAT THOSE WINTER PRESSURES ARE ALSO BECOMING THE NORM IN SUMMER MONTHS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NUFFIELD TRUST NIGEL EDWARDS SAYS THERE'S A DANGER OF A DOWNWARD SPIRAL

TRUST THE BROADCASTERS GOVERNING BODY TO BE SCRAPPED THE COMMONS CULTURE COMMITTEE SAID THE BODY HAD LOST CONFIDENCE AND CREDIBILITY THEIR REPORT SUGGESTED THAT THE CORPORATION'S DIRECTOR GENERAL OPERATED WITH TWO HIGHER DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE AND WASN'T EFFECT ACCOUNTABLE TO NO ONE THE M.P.S ALSO NOTED THAT THE B. B. C. WAS SERVED BY AN OFTEN UNWIELDY BUREAUCRACY AND THE CULTURE WHICH HAD BEEN CRITICISED AS ARROGANT
ONE OF THE FIRST BRITISH PEOPLE TO BE GIVEN A HEART TRANSPLANT HAS DIED THIRTY THREE YEARS AFTER UNDERGOING THE OPERATION JOHN MCCAFFERTY WHO WAS SEVENTY THREE AND FROM BUCKINGHAMSHIRE HAD HELD THE RECORD AS THE WORLD'S LONGEST SURVIVING HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT MY CAVITIES WHY HE SAID THE OPERATION HAD GIVEN THEM THIRTY BRILLIANT YEARS ALLOWING THEM TO TRAVEL THE WORLD
THE TRANSFER WAS CARRIED OUT BY THE PIONEERING SURGEON SIR MAGDI YOU COOP WHO TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT AFTER THE SURGERY THEY WEREN'T SURE HOW LONG MY MCCAFFERTY WOULD LIVE OH YOU WILL
SIR MAGDI COOP TALKING THERE IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE MADE CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT THE NEW CONTRACT BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT THEY MAY HAVE IT IMPOSED ON THEM AS EARLY AS TODAY THE GOVERNMENT MADE A FINAL TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT OFFER LAST NIGHT
WHICH MADE SOME CONCESSIONS BUT THE B.M.A. REJECTED THAT ONE OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS DESCRIBED IT AS THE END OF THE ROAD HUGH PYM IS A HEALTH EDITOR AND HUGH PYM IF WE ARE IN THIS STALEMATE WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT HAPPENS NOW
WELL SARAH IT SEEMS FAIRLY INEVITABLE NOW THE GOVERNMENT WILL IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND AND THAT COULD HAPPEN WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS IT COULD BE TODAY
IF NOT THEN PROBABLY FRIDAY OR MONDAY AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS WHO
IF YOU LIKE COME ON STREAM IN AUGUST THE NEW TRAINEES ARE COMING OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL WILL HAVE THIS NEW CONTRACT
PUT IN FRONT OF THEM BUT NOT ONLY THEM DOCTORS IN TRAINING AS THEY'RE KNOWN WHO GO ON TRAINING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER QUALIFYING IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS THEY MOVE JOBS AROUND THE COUNTRY QUITE A LOT EVERY TIME THEY DO MOVE JOBS THEY'LL BE GIVEN THIS NEW CONTRACT
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN POSTS FOR A LONGER PERIOD WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO AFFECT THEM AND IT'S HARD TO RECALL ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR NORMALLY THESE THINGS ARE NEGOTIATED THEIR EXTREMELY COMPLICATED BUT THE GOVERNMENT FEELS IT'S REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD IT'S CHIEF NEGOTIATORS ARE DAVID DALTON
USE THAT EXPRESSION IN A LETTER TO THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ABOUT THIS FINAL OFFER THAT IF IT WASN'T ACCEPTED BY THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY HE WOULD FEEL IT WAS THE END OF THE ROAD AND WOULD ADVISE THE SECRETARY OF STATE JEREMY HUNT IN SUCH TERMS LEAVING THE WAY OPEN FOR MY HUNT TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS IMPOSITION PROCESS
IF JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE PREPARED TO GO OUT ON STRIKE DURING NEGOTIATIONS WHAT WILL THEY DO WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THAT THE ONLY CONTRACT OPEN ON OFFER TO THEM IS ONE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY REJECTED
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE B.M.A. WILL DO JUST TALKING TO SENIOR FIGURES IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL AT MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THEY WILL CONSIDER FURTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTION WHICH WILL CARRY ON POSSIBLY LIKE YESTERDAY AFFECTING ROUTINE A NON EMERGENCY CARE AT HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND THERE MAY BE FURTHER DAYS LIKE THAT AND I THINK YOU'LL BE VERY UNCHARTED WATERS IF YOU LIKE AS TO HOW THIS CONTRACT IS DRAWN UP
HOW IT'S ACTUALLY IMPOSED IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM IN HOSPITALS HOW DIFFERENT CONTRACT WORK FOR DIFFERENT JUNIOR DOCTORS IT'LL BE UP TO THE B.M.A. WHETHER THEY CONTINUE THIS ACTION BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE INTO A NEW PHASE IN THIS DISPUTE WHICH HAS RUMBLED ON FOR NEARLY FOUR YEARS THERE'VE BEEN ENDLESS TALKS
RECENTLY JUST EVEN TWO DAYS AGO THE GOVERNMENT FEELS IT'S MOVED AN EXTREMELY LONG WAY TO MEETING THE CONCERNS OF THE B.M.A. ABOUT WORKING HOURS AND SAFETY IT FELT IT MAKE COMPROMISES AS LATEST TUESDAY NIGHT ON HER DOCTORS WERE PAID FOR WEEKENDS BUT IT CAN'T REALLY GO ANY FURTHER
EQUALLY THE B.M.A. FEELS IT JUST HASN'T HAD THE ASSURANCES IT NEEDS ON HOW DOCTORS ARE PAID FOR WORKING ON SATURDAYS GIVEN ALL THE UNSOCIAL HOURS THEY WORK THERE IS STILL THAT DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES CUPAN THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE WAS NOT ONLY CALLED IN A JUDGE TO LOOK INTO THE WAY HIS FORCES CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE HE HAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE WAY THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED AT THE HEART OF THIS IS OPERATION MIDLAND SET UP TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS GOING BACK OVER DECADES SOMETIMES AGAIN SOME OF THE MEN WHO WOULD AT THE VERY PINNACLE OF PUBLIC LIFE INCLUDING THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY LORD BRAMALL AND THE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BRITTEN
I'M JOINED BY THE Q.C. ALISON LEVITT WHOSE FUR MICH CONDOR RARE REPRESENTED LAWNED BRITAIN AND BY THE B.B.C. REPORTER ALISTAIR JACKSON WHO DISCLOSE SOME SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS FOR PANORAMA AND THE REPORT INTO THE WAY INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AND ALISTAIR VERY LONG VERY COMPLICATED BUT IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS WHAT WERE THOSE SHORTCOMINGS AS YOU DISCOVERED
I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE KNOW NOW FROM THE BROWN OR CASES THAT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW HIS HOME WAS RAIDED WITH TWENTY ODD POLICE OFFICERS HAD TO WAIT TEN MONTHS TO BE TOLD THAT NO FAR WOULD EVEN BE BEING SENT THERE SEE PEARSON
HE HE WOULD THINK THAT WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO BE KEY PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE TO HIM FOR EXAMPLE WEREN'T SPOKEN TO UNTIL RELATIVELY LATE IN THE INVESTIGATION AND HE SAYS ONLY WHEN HE ASKED THAT THEY WERE HE TOLD ME IT WAS LIKE HAVING TO PROVE HIMSELF INNOCENT HANDS I THINK PERHAPS MORE SURPRISING THAN THAT IS THAT THOSE CLOSE TO NICK THE MAN MAKING THESE ALLEGATIONS SOME WEREN'T SPOKEN TO BY THE POLICE AT ALL I UNDERSTAND FOR EXAMPLE HIS EX WIFE HE SPENT AROUND EIGHTEEN YEARS
WITH HIM HASN'T YET BEEN SPOKEN TO THE MET CAN SAY THAT BUT ME AND PEOPLE LIKE ME WON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN THE INVESTIGATION I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR THE MET WAS THAT WHEN DETAILS LIKE THAT STARTED EMERGING IT JUST GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT
STARTING WITH A POSITION OF BELIEF HAD STOPPED THE OUT THESE ALLEGATIONS BEING INVESTIGATED EVIL IN OF THEMSELVES IN FAVOUR OF GOING QUICKLY TO MAKING PUBLIC APPEALS SEARCHING THE HOMES OF PEOPLE LIKE LORD BRAMALL WITH ALL OF THAT EVENTUALLY INVOLVED FOR HIM AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD THERE'D BE NO ACTION TAKEN BUT THEY OF COURSE WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE
OF COURSE YOU CAN LOOK BACK I THINK TO THAT PRESS CONFERENCE IN DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN MET OFFICERS STOOD UP AND SAID THE ALLEGATIONS HE WERE INVESTIGATING WERE CREDIBLE AND TRUE THAT HADN'T COME FROM NOWHERE CLEARLY IT'S STARTING FROM THIS POSITION OF BELIEF SENIOR VOICES AND POLICING THAT SO THIS IS DESIGNED TO GET THE CONFIDENCE OF SURVIVORS GET THEM TO COME
AND OF COURSE IT GOT RESULTS BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM SAYING IT IN THAT PARTICULAR PRESS CONFERENCE WAS THAT THESE PARTICULAR SET OF ALLEGATIONS WERE JUST SO STAGGERING INVOLVING THREE CHILD MURDERS WHERE NOBODY'S HAD BEEN FOUND A COLLECTION OF NAMES
FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE BRITISH ESTABLISHMENT PEOPLE LIKE ME ON BRITAIN LORD BRAMALL SPANNING NEARLY A DECADE FROM THE MID SEVENTIES THERE TO START WITH A POSITION OF BELIEF FOR THOSE SET OF ALLEGATIONS I THINK IT ALWAYS THE RISK OF EVENTS TO EXPOSING THE MET TO ACCUSATIONS IT'D LET GO OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES JUST IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE UP FOR HOW BADLY SOME SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN LET DOWN IN THE PAST THEM AT THE MET EVENTUALLY SAID THAT WAS A MISTAKE BUT REALLY I THINK YOU HAVE TO SAY IT WAS TOO LATE THOSE COMMENTS SPOKE TO AN INVESTIGATIVE MINDS
THAT HAS MORE INFORMATION SEATS OUT ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION IT JUST LOOKED WORSE AND WORSE FOR THE AND OF COURSE WHAT SEEMS TO BE SAYING THE POLICE NEED TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE STARTING THESE INVESTIGATIONS FROM OF COURSE HE'S MAKING A POINT ABOUT PROCESS
BUT I THINK WHAT SOME PEOPLE MAY STILL WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION WHAT IT WAS WHERE IT WAS GOING AND WHERE IT WASN'T GOING AND WHAT LEADERSHIP HE GAVE IT AT THAT POINT AND ALISON HAVE IT WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR HIM YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN OF THE GUARDIAN THIS MORNING
THE PRONOUNCE WOULD SEEM A BIT BAFFLING TO ME I KNEW BASICALLY WHAT THE POLICE BELIEVE HIM DON'T BELIEVE HIS HOLY IRRELEVANT THEY'RE NOT THERAPISTS THEY'RE NOT JUDGE AND JURY THERE TO INVESTIGATE WHEN I REPORTED ON THE C.P.S. TREATMENT OF THE ALL VICTIMS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT REALLY WHAT THE POLICE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE DOING IS APPLYING EXACTLY THE SAME TEST FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL OFFENCES AS FOR ANY OTHER AND IF I'M GIVEN AN ANALOGY IT'S QUITE A CRUDE BUT IT MAKES THE POINT
SOMEBODY RINGS THE POLICE AND SAYS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BURGLED THE POLICE AS I'M NOT GOING TO START OFF BY SAYING WELL MAYBE THIS IS AN INSURANCE FRAUD SO I'VE GOT TO BE ULTRA CAREFUL BEFORE I INVESTIGATED BUT IF YOU RING UP AND SAY I WAS BURGLED THIRTY YEARS AGO IT MIGHT BE QUITE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE POLICE TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THAT HOUSE BEFORE THEY GO AROUND ARRESTING PEOPLE IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE
RIGHT SO WHAT SHOULD SIR BERNARD HAVE SAID THAT HE HASN'T NO SAID WELL THERE ARE AND EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR SIR RICHARD HENRY KISS BUT I THINK THERE IS THAT HE'S THE JUDGE THEY RETIRED JUDGE HAS BEEN CALLED IN TO INVESTIGATE ON BEHALF OF THE PLIGHT THAT THERE IS A DANGER THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INQUIRIES INTO THE ENQUIRIES THERE'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES GOING INTO INTO THIS IT'S AN ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED SUBJECT
IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STRAIGHTFORWARD PRACTICAL MEASURES COULD BE TAKEN WHICH WILL STILL SEEK TO HOLD THE BALANCE AFTER ALL THERE ARE COMPLAINANTS HERE WHO MAY WELL HAVE A GENUINE CASE THAT NEEDS INVESTIGATING AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE LOST SIGHT OF SENDING A MESSAGE SAYING THAT THE POLICE WILL NO LONGER BELIEVE HER COMPLAINANTS IS LIKE A KITE ON THAT HOUSING IMAGE WHAT YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO OVERTURN THE PRESUMPTION THAT A VICTIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE
EVEN IF HE HASN'T SAID THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT THE COMPLAINANTS AGAIN TO HEAR BUT THERE ARE PRACTICAL STEPS COULD BE TAKEN THAT DON'T ACTUALLY REQUIRE A COMPLETE RE CALIBRATION OF THE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE
IT COULD A CODE OF PRACTICE COULD BE GIVEN FOR POLICE INVESTIGATIONS THAT IN THESE VERY OLD ALLEGATIONS THE ARREST OR INTERVIEW OR SEARCH OF THE SUSPECT'S HOME IS THE LAST THING THAT HAPPENS NOT THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS
IF SOMEBODY'S MADE AN ALLEGATION THAT YOU RAPED SOMEONE THIRTY YEARS AGO WHAT ISN'T INTERVIEW GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT COULDN'T BE ACHIEVED BY OTHER MEANS ALL IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT A SUSPECT CAN SAY WHETHER GUILTY OR INNOCENT IS I DIDN'T DO IT THEY CAN'T OFFER MUCH ELSE SO THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD START AT THE OTHER END OF IT THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD TURN UP WITH TWENTY OFFICERS
AND SEARCH THE SUSPECT'S HOME ABOUT NOW ALLEGATION OF SOMETHING THAT TOOK PLACE DECADES AGO WHAT WERE THEY HOPING THAT THEY WERE WHAT IT WHAT IF THE RESULT OF THAT IS PUBLICITY AND THE RESULT OF THAT PUBLICITY THE EFFECT OF THAT PUBLICITY IS TO BRING OUT OF THE WOODWORK PEOPLE WHO DO KNOW STUFF AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT ARGUMENT AND AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A QUESTION OF SEEKING TO ACHIEVE A BALANCE HERE SIR BERNARD HAS SAID WITH WHICH I AGREE THAT REALLY THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MOVE ON THE QUESTION OF ANONYMITY UP UNTIL THE POINT OF CHARGE
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HASN'T BEEN DEALT WITH ALREADY APPEARS TO HAVE ALMOST UNIVERSAL SUPPORT BECAUSE THE POINT OF CHARGES ONE AT WHICH AN OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE STRENGTH OF THE EVIDENCE HE'S TAKEN THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION
BUT IS THAT NO SUSPECT IS NAMED UP UNTIL THE POINT TO CHARGE EXCEPT WITH THE POLICE HAVING THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR EXAMPLE TO A JUDGE FOR AN ORDER TO BE MADE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PUT HER NAME UP THERE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WOULD HAVE REAL UTILITY FOR THE INVESTIGATION AS IN FOR EXAMPLE IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THERE ARE OTHER VICTIMS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT COME FORWARD BUT THE PRESUMPTION SHOULD BE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE NAMED IN THAT WOULD STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE ALISTAIR LOVE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ALISTAIR JACKSON AS WELL THANKS BUT
IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN OR PRICES ARE FALLING THE FRACKING AND SHALE GAS MARKET SEEMINGLY ON HOLD SO WHO WOULD WANT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE OF THE ENERGY MARKET THAT PIPE SIMON BEWARE YOU'RE GOING BE P. WANT A PREDICTED THE OIL GIANT HAS JUST PUBLISHED ITS LATEST GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK IT SAYS OUR DEMAND FOR ENERGY IS ONLY GOING TO GO UP AS THE GLOBAL POPULATION RISES
AN INCOME TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD INCREASE B.P.'S CHIEF ECONOMIST IS SPENCER DALE FORMERLY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE SEES AHEAD FOR SUPPLYING THAT NEED
WE SEE NATURAL GAS HAS BEEN THE FASTEST GROWING FOSSIL FUEL THAT'S HELPED BY THE PLENTIFUL SUPPLIES OF GAS AND ALSO STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION WHICH HELPS GAS GAIN SHARE FROM FROM COAL
THE OTHER BIG STRONG GROWING ENERGY SOURCES ITS RENEWABLES WE EXPECT TO SEE WHEN YOU WAS GROW QUICKLY SOLAR AND WIND POWER ALMOST QUADRUPLING OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS
AND THE MAIN ENERGY SOURCE WHICH IS FALLING BACK IT IS COLE WHICH WE EXPECTED THE GROWTH RATE OF CULT TO SLOW VERY SHARPLY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHINA IN THE REBALANCING OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY YOU SAY I HAVE PICKED OUT A FEW BITS OF SKIN THE REPORT MYSELF AND I SEE SAY DESPITE THE SLOWDOWN IN THE MISSIONS GROWTH
THE LEVEL OF CARBON EMISSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW INCREASING TWENTY PER CENT BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE I'M JUST WONDERING DOES YOUR OUTLOOK FIT IN WITH WHAT WAS AGREED BACK IN PARIS DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEW WAS WHETHER THESE TWO THINGS AS A COMPATIBLE
SO TWO KEY MESSAGES ON CARBON THE WORLD'S IS USING ENERGY MORE EFFICIENTLY IS SWITCHING TOWARDS LOWER CARBON FUELS AND SOAK THE GROWTH OF CARBON EMISSIONS SHOULD SHOULD DECLINE WITH IT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS TO BE SLOWER GROWTH BUT IT IS STILL GROWING THE ASPIRATIONS LET OUT IN PARIS WAS WE NEED TO SIGNIFICANT FALL
SO THE CENTRAL ONE OF THE CENTRAL MESSAGES OF OUR ENERGY OUTLOOK IS WE NEED MORE POLICY ACTION TO BRING ABOUT THAT FALL OFF BY YOUR ESTIMATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO HIT THE PARIS TARGETS BASED ON A VIEW OF HOW POLICIES LIKELY TO EVOLVE A SUGGESTED WE NEED MORE POLICY ACCENTED TO ACHIEVE THAT WHAT ABOUT THE SHORTER TERM WE ARE IN THIS OIL SLUMP AT THE MOMENT WHICH AT FIRST BUT EVERYONE SAID WAS A JOLLY GOOD THING FOR THE WORLD NOT BRILLIANT
PRODUCERS LIKE B. P. BUT WAS GOOD FOR WORLD ECONOMY BUT IN FACT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BENEFIT YET CERTAINLY NOT IN FINANCIAL MARKETS WHEN DOES THE WILL PRICE START TO GO UP WHY AND WHY WILL IT STOP
SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS THERE IS A MARKET WHERE WE JUST SEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SUPPLY WE SAW INITIALLY THAT CAME FROM FROM THE U.S. IN THE SHOWER REVOLUTION AND AS THAT SUPPLIES COME ON EVEN THOUGH DEMANDS BEEN GROWING STRONGLY IT'S TAKING A WHILE TO WORK OFF THAT EXCESS APPLY BUT THE OIL MARKET IS DOING WHAT ALL MARKETS DOING IS RESPONDING TO LOW OIL PRICES AND SO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS DEMAND IS INCREASING
VERY SUBSTANTIALLY DEMAND GROWTH OIL LAST YEAR WAS TWICE HIS TEN YEAR AVERAGE THIS IS NOT A STORY OF WEAK DEMAND IT'S A STORY OF STRONG DEMAND TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH SUPPLY SUPPLIES COMING OFF YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF RAKES AND INVESTMENT WITHIN THE U.S. IS COMING OFF VERY SHARPLY SO THIS MARKET IS GRADUALLY ADJUSTING EXACTLY WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN IS IT'S HARD TO TO TO KNOW BUT BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS MY BEST GUESSES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR
THE MARKET MOVES CLOSER INTO BALANCE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR HOW LOW PRICES COULD GO WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY TWENTY I'VE HURT PEOPLE AND WERE RECENTLY WHEN I WAS IN DOUBLE SAY TEN I HAD A LIBYAN FORM OLIVIA SAY FIVE EXACTLY WHERE PRICES WILL BOTTOM OUT IT'S HARD TO KNOW I THINK IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH WE DO SEE THE MARKET GETTING BETTER OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT THINGS WOULD GET WORSE BEFORE THEY GET BETTER SO IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE PRICES COULD FALL SOMEWHAT LOWER IN THE NEAR TEN BUT AS I SAY THE BIG PICTURE IS ONE WHICH IS A MARKET ADJUSTING
GRADUALLY COMING ROUND BY THE END OF THE YEAR THERE WAS B.P.'S CHIEF ECONOMIST SPENCE DELON EGG LABEL ENERGY OUTLOOK IS ACTUALLY QUITE AN INTERESTING DOCUMENT I'M TREATING HER LINKED TO IT IN A FEW MOMENTS TIME AND ALSO JOHNSTON PRESS PUBLISHER OF THINGS LIKE THE YORKSHIRE POST SAYS IT'S IN ADVANCED NEGOTIATIONS TO BUY THE ART NEWSPAPER THE ARCHIVE FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION POUNDS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IF THE EYE GOES THAT COULD BE TRICKY FOR THE INDEPENDENT TO SURVIVE
THANK YOU SIMON TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN OXFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE CUTTING CHILDREN'S CENTRES COS HE COULDN'T AFFORD TO RUN THEM ANY LONGER IT WAS MET WITH HOWLS OF PROTEST FROM THE LOCAL N. P. ONE DAVID CAMERON NOT ONLY HIM BUT ALSO HIS MOTHER MARY AND HIS AUNT CLARE THIS WEEK THEY CALL THE CUTS ARE GREAT GREAT ERROR COUNCIL SAYS THEY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BECAUSE OF CUTS TO THEIR BUDGET FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SO WE CALL REPORTS FROM OXFORD
WILLIAM AND JAY WERE SWINGING ON THE GATE BUT HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THEY BE ABLE TO PLAY HERE
I'M A GRAND PONT CHILDREN CENTRE WHICH IS ONE OF THE PLACES THE COUNCILLORS PROPOSING TO CLOSE IT IN QUITE A WHILE TO DO PART OF OXFORD BUT CAMPAIGNERS HERE SAY THAT NOT FAR FROM HERE THERE ARE SOME QUITE DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES AND THIS CENTRE DOES APPEAL TO FAMILIES FROM ACROSS THE SOCIAL DIVIDE
MY NAME IS NEIL TUCK THAT THIS IS MY SON WILLIAM WHO IS EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD
WHAT I'VE NOTICED THIS IN TERMS OF WHO'S COMING AND GOING IS IT'S QUITE A MIDDLE CLASS PROFILE WHAT THE COUNCIL WOULD SAY HE'S IN A TIME OF AUSTERITY WE HAVE GOT TO TARGET OUR RESOURCES TO THE MOST NEEDY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HER
WHEN I WHEN I USE THE CENTRE WHEN I GO TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC GROUPS THERE ARE A VERY DIVERSE RANGE OF OF USERS SOME OF PERHAPS LESS WELL OFF SOME OF THE MIGRANT COMMUNITY THESE THE ONES THAT NEED SUPPORT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE
WHO DO YOU BLAME THE COUNCIL OR ACTUALLY IS THIS CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS THIS ACTUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER I'M SURE THERE'S A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
MY NAME'S JO HUGH ISH AND I REPRESENT THE SAVE OXFORDSHIRE CHILDREN CENTRES CAMPAIGN IN A NUTSHELL CHILDREN CENTRE SAVED ME WHEN I HAD MY SON I'D BEEN IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP FOR ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS IT WAS VERY CONTROLLING IT WAS VERY VIOLENT
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS MASSIVE CUTS COMING IN THE NAME OF AUSTERITY AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SOCIETY AND OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN OXFORDSHIRE BUT THE TERRIBLE THING IS IF YOU DON'T PUT UNIVERSAL SERVICES AND PREVENTION IN PLACE PEOPLE LIKE ME
WILL SLIP THROUGH THE NET DAVID CAMERON'S MOTHER AND HIS AUNT HAVE SIGNED A PETITION OPPOSING THE CLOSING OF THE CENTRES AND HIS AUNT CLARE CURRY TOLD I.T.V. NEWS THIS WEEK THAT HER NEPHEW WAS SUPPOSED TO THE CUTS WELL I KNOW THAT HE DOESN'T WANT THEM TO BE SHOT EITHER YOU HE'S FAMILY MAN TOO BUT THEY'RE JUST MAKING SHUT DO YOU KNOW

I THINK THE CUT GREAT GREAT ERROR PLEASE GIVE US ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP THESE IMPORTANT THINGS
ON WEDNESDAY THE COUNCIL SAID SOME UNIVERSAL CHILD SERVICES WILL REMAIN BUT THEY WILL PRIORITISE HELPING THE MOST VULNERABLE THROUGH NEWLY CREATED FAMILY CENTRES
SURTOUT THE CABINET MEMBER FOR CHILDREN I WAS SHE GOING TO COUNCIL THE LOCAL M.P. HE HAPPENS TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS THAT THERE MUST BE EFFICIENCY SAVINGS YOU COULD MAKE INSTEAD SURELY
THAT DOESN'T COME ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN CHILDREN'S SERVICES DOES THAT I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THE PRIME MINISTER YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK IN THAT OTHER NOT OTHER SERVICES YOU COULD CUT ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD TO TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CUTS PERCENTAGE WISE SO IT ISN'T A CASE OF NOT DOING POT HOLES ANY MORE TO DO CHILDREN CENTRES OR SERVICES HAVE TAKEN THE CAR
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT THE COUNCIL IS BEING ESSENTIALLY QUITE MANIPULATIVE THAT THIS IS A GAME OF BRINKMANSHIP THAT IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT CUTTING CHILDREN'S SERVICES THEN YOU ESSENTIALLY FORCE THE GOVERNMENT INTO GIVING YOU MORE MONEY I DON'T NOBODY SAID BRINKMANSHIP PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THEY DON'T THAT THIS A FALSE ECONOMY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING IT
BUT WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE HAD TO CUT THE BUDGET IN HALF BUT SURELY THERE MUST BE OTHER SERVICES YOU CAN CUT HOW CAN IT GET ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN CHILDREN SERVICES WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE OUR STATUTORY SERVICES IN PLACE WHICH IS TO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN ADULTS ANYBODY IN SOCIETY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S FAMILY WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THESE CUTS NOTHING WRONG TO OPPOSE CUTS YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM

SO BERNARD HAS ANNOUNCED A JUDGE LED REVIEW INTO INVESTIGATIONS OF HISTORICAL ABUSE INCLUDING OPERATION MIDLAND WHICH HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO AN ALLEGED V.I.P. PAEDOPHILE RING
THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS REJECTED WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE GOVERNMENT'S FINAL OFFER TO JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND ON WEEKEND WORKING IT'S NOW EXPECTED THAT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT WILL IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT A SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE BY THE DOCTOR'S ENDS IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR
A REPORT IS WARNING THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS FACING GROWING PRESSURE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCE DURING THE WINTER IN RECENT YEARS THE STUDY WAS COMPILED BY TWO LEADING CHARITIES THE NUFFIELD TRUST HAVE THEIR HEALTH FOUNDATION
SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES HAVE STARTED WITHDRAWING THEIR WORKERS FROM AN INDUSTRIAL PARK IN NORTH KOREA WHICH IS JOINTLY RUN BY THE TWO COUNTRIES SO THIS HALTING OPERATIONS IN THE GAS UN COMPLEX IN RETALIATION FOR THE NORTH RECENTLY CARRYING OUT A NUCLEAR TEST AND FIRING A LONG RANGE MISSILE
THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS BECOME THE LATEST CANDIDATE TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EARLIER THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF HEWLETT PACKARD CAR LEAFY ARENA ANNOUNCED SHE WAS PULLING OUT BOTH HAD POOR RESULTS IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY WHICH WAS DECISIVELY WON BY DONALD TRUMP
THE STUDY HAS REVEALED THAT THE AVERAGE SALARY OF A UNIVERSITY VICE CHANCELLOR NOW STANDS AT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND UP BY AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND ON LAST YEAR THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION WHICH CARRIED OUT THE RESEARCH SAYS VICE CHANCELLORS ARE ACCEPTING LARGE PAY RISES AND POETS WHILE STAFF SALARIES REMAIN STAGNANT THE BODY REPRESENTING UNIVERSITIES SAYS THEY'RE PAID IN LINE WITH THE HEADS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE A CANCER PATIENT IN ENGLAND SO SAYS THE U.K. BOSS OF PFIZER ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DRUGS COMPANIES AT LEAST AS QUOTED IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY
ERIC NOT CAMP SAYS THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF FUNDING DRUGS IS BROKEN HE SAYS PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND AND EVEN IN GREECE HER BETTER OFF
TODAY THE GOVERNMENT ENDS ITS CONSULTATION ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CANCER DRUGS FUND IT WAS A SEPARATE POOL OF MONEY TO PAY FOR DRUGS THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE APPROVED BY NICE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND CARE EXCELLENCE WELL ERIC NOD CAMP JOINS US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SIR WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS THAT ENGLAND IS GETTING SO WRONG WHAT'S HE GETTING
WILTED TODAY AS YOU AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY BECAUSE THE THE CONSULTATION CLOSES FOR THE CANCER DRUGS FUND WHY'S IT SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE IN TWO PEOPLE IN THE U.K. IS GOING TO GET CANCER IN THEIR LIFETIME ARE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SO THIS LITTLE STUDIO HERE YOU KNOW THAT'S I THINK YOU ONLY PROBABLY SARAH IT'S GOING TO GET IT SO IF YOU'VE GOT A FACE THAT CHALLENGE YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE WHEN YOU DO FACE THAT CHALLENGE
THE PROPOSAL THAT HE'S THERE HE'S ON THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT IS HE'S NOT FIXING THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WHEN THE CANCER DRUGS FUND STARRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS CREATED BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM WAS BROKEN THE WAY THAT NICELY EVALUATING ASSESSORS MEDICINES AND AND HOW THEY HOW HOW THAT THEN GETS THROUGH THE SYSTEM
THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT UNDERLYING CHANT SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS REALLY BROKEN BUT THE ARGUMENT PUT FORWARD NOT LEAST BY THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE HAVE LOOKED AT THIS IS THAT THE THE BENEFITS OF THE CANCER DRUG FUND ARE NOT CLEAR AND THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO SAY THAT IT WAS INTRODUCED
ARGUABLY TO DEAL WITH HEADLINES HEADLINES OR I'M OFFER INDIVIDUALS BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE POOL OF PEOPLE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE NICE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CARE AND HEALTH EXCELLENT MAKING JUDGEMENTS ON THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF A DRUM
SORRY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK THE THEY'RE MY SHOULD BE ASSESSING THE VALUE OF A MEDICINE LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRY DO
LIKE SCOTLAND US WITH THE S. AND C. BY GERMANY DOES LIKE FRANCE DOES EVERY COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING VALUE FOR MONEY WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE SYSTEM THAT USED IN ENGLAND
HE'S COMING UP WITH A DIFFERENT OUTPUT THEN THE SYSTEM IN SCOTLAND IN THE SYSTEM IN GERMANY THEN THE SYSTEM IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND THAT IS REALLY THE PROBLEM THAT'S WHY THE SYSTEM'S BROKEN IT NEEDS TO BE REASSESSED CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHY THAT IS WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST NICE IS GETTING WRONG IN THE WAY THAT IT EVALUATE STRUCK
WELL THE BIT WITH THE SYSTEM THAT THAT NICE HE'S USING IS REALLY FROM THE LAST CENTURY RIGHT IT HASN'T CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN SIXTEEN YEARS IT IS QUITE A TECHNICAL WAY OF ASSESSING MEDICINES
IT DOESN'T TAKE SOME OF THE PRAGMATIC VIEW THAT THAT FOR EXAMPLE SCOTLAND TAKES WHERE IT IMMEDIATELY IN SEARCH COMMISSIONS AND PATIENTS INTO THAT DISCUSSION COMES UP WITH A MEDICS AND SOLUTION THAT ASSESSES THAT ROW IN THERE MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHY THEY THEY COME UP WITH IT WITH A DIFFERENT OUTCOME THE OTHER PROBLEM I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY PART THAT'S BROKEN THE MOMENT THAT NICE DUSTS
THAT'S COME TO A POSITIVE DECISION IN THE FEW TIMES THAT IT DOES FOR CANCER PATIENTS IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT IT ACTUALLY GETS TO PATIENTS THAT'S A SECOND PART OF THE SYSTEM SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN BECAUSE THE THE DECISION MAKING IN TERMS OF POACHING IS DIVORCED SO THAT DECISION THEN ALSO NEEDS TO BE MADE BY THE PURCHASED LOCALLY BUT IT KNOWN CRITICISM OF HIM TELL ME IF I'M GETTING THIS WRONG BUT WHETHER IT'S THAT NICE ALL WHEN IT'S BEEN DEVOLVED EVEN IF NICE IS APPROVED IT IS DOWN TO COST
THAT THAT WHOEVER IS BUYING THE DRUG OR APPROVING THE DRUG DIS DEEMS THAT IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE OF VALUE AND IN LARGE PART THAT COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU DECIDE TO SET AS THE PROPS FOR THAT DRUG
I THINK I'M HAPPY YOU BROUGHT THAT UP SARAH PRICING IS THAT IS THAT IS A BIG DISCUSSION NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT AROUND THE CLOCK TO BE FAIR THE U.K. ACTUALLY IS GETTING A PRETTY GOOD DEAL IN TERMS OF PRICE IF YOU LOOK AT PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE OR YOU'RE BELOW THE AVERAGE
IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE OUTCOME OF THE OF THE SYSTEM THAT EVALUATES THAT END IN SCOTLAND AND IN THE U.K. THEY HAVE THE SAME PRICE THEY COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION
THEN IN ENGLAND SO THAT ONCE DRIVING A HARD BARGAIN AND THAT'S ONE THING AND THAT BASICALLY THE THERE'S I'M SAYING THE PRICE THAT YOU GETTING IS A GOOD DEAL SO YOU ARE GETTING A GOOD DEAL BUT STILL WITH THOSE PRICE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE MOST THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS THE SURVIVAL RATE FOR CANCER AND SCOTLAND BETTER THAN IT IS IN ENGLAND
THE SURVIVAL RATES IN OUTCOMES IN IN THE U.K. WE ONLY HAD TO BID FOR THE U.K. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES IS REALLY LAGGING BEHIND OUTCOMES BUT THERE ARE TO BE FAIR THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PARAMETERS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HOW QUICKLY YOU GET DIAGNOSED AND THAT'S THE ONE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SAID THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE'VE A VERY POOR RECORD ON EARLY DIAGNOSIS YES EXCELLENT
ONE OF THE CRITICISMS THAT COULD BE MADE OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IT'S AS IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD TO THE N.H.S. TO RANSOM YOU'RE SAYING LOOK WE'VE GOT THIS SYSTEM IT'S NOT GOOD TO BE A DRUGS COMPANY HERE AND THAT IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE THREATENING THE U.K. OVER
WHETHER THEY'RE DIS DECISIONS ABOUT DRUG USE OF DRUGS AND WHERE THE DRUG SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED ME WHAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT IF YOU'RE A CANCER PATIENT IN ENGLAND YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF GETTING ACCESS TO THE BEST TREATMENT AVAILABLE LIKE THEY DO IN SCOTLAND LIKE THEY DO IN GERMANY LIKE THEY DO IN FRANCE
THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT A THREAT THIS IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT I POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT IS BEING DONE IN ENGLAND WAS BEING DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEIR VISOR IS STILL FULLY COMMITTED TO OR THAT IT HAS GOING ON IN THE U.K. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE U.K. BUT I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN THE U.K. ANDY INVESTMENT INWARD INVESTMENT THE POWER DATA SHOWS THAT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OUR ANDY INWARD INVESTMENT IS GOING DOWN EVERY YEAR BY ABOUT FOUR PER CENT WHERE THE OVERALL OR ANDY IN THE U.K. IS GOING UP BY FIVE PER CENT
MANUFACTURING IS GOING DOWN AS WELL SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OVERALL BETWEEN BUSINESS SENTIMENT IN THE U.K. IN TERMS OF THEIR LIFE SCIENCE SECTOR AND IN THE HOT FAIRLY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE UPTAKE OF INNOVATIVE MEDICINES IN THE U.K. WHICH HE LAY AT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOOR
WHAT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY TODAY WHAT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT THAT ABSOLUTELY
ERIC NOT CAMP THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE TAKEN TO TASK BY THE SUN FOR CARRYING OUT A SECOND STRIKE IN THE DISPUTE OVER PAY AND WORKING HOURS THE SUN ACCUSES THEM A BLATANT CYNICISM DECLARING THEIR LOVE FOR THEIR PATIENCE EVEN WHILE THEY ABANDON THEM

GENTRIFICATION IS SOMETHING THAT MANY CITY NEIGHBOURHOODS EXPERIENCE EVEN FICTIONAL ONES THE LATEST SESAME STREET HOME TO BIG BIRD AND OSCAR THE GROUCH AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A SOMEWHAT GRITTY SETTING FOR AMERICA'S LONGEST RUNNING TELEVISION SHOW FOR CHILDREN FIRST DEBUTED ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IN THE LATE SIXTIES TO EDUCATE TODDLERS AND LOW INCOME AREAS
BUT NOW SESAME STREET HAS MOVED TO H.B.O. AND THAT'S HIT A NERVE AMONG PARENTS AND EDUCATORS WHO HAVE NOTICED THAT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS CHANGED THIS SEASON SESAME STREET WORKSHOP SAYS THOSE CHANGES WERE ALREADY IN PLACE BEFORE THE DEAL WITH H.B.O. BUT DOES THE MOVE TO A PREMIUM CABLE GIANT WITH A PAY WAR CHANGE WHAT WAS THE PROGRAMME'S MISSION NICK BRIAN TOOK A WALK TO THE SESAME STREET WORKSHOP IN NEW YORK TO FIND
NETWORKERS BROUGHT YOU GAVE US THROWS THE SOPRANOS THE WHY
BUT NOW THE H.B.O. EMPIRE HAS COLONISED ONE OF THE MOST SACRED PLOTS OF REAL ESTATE IN AMERICAN TELEVISION THE HOME A BIG BIRD ROVER
FROM SESAME STREET GOING IN SUMMER I'VE NEVER INTERVIEWED AND A MUPPET BEFORE THAT WAS VERY CONFUSING BUT JUST STARING PINK AND BOUNCE SO HOW ABOUT THE MOVE TO H.B.O. ARMOUR HAS AGO HOW DOES LIKE TO THE LETTERS H.B. BUT NOT ME AND I DID THAT ONCE
NO WONDER THEY'RE SANDING SO CHEERY H.B.O. IT'S GIVEN THE PROGRAMME A MUCH SURER FINANCIAL FOOTING AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS FACING TOUGH COMPETITION FROM STREAMING SERVICES LIKE MET FLICKS AND ITS MERCHANDISING HADN'T BEEN SELLING SO WELL AND THOUGH IT'S MUCH LOVED CHARACTERS ARE STILL ON THE SAME STREET THE NEIGHBOURHOODS
IT IS A YEAR OF MORE CHANGES THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN ONE SEASON BEFORE OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS BEEN RENOVATED THAT'S CAROLINE PARENTAL SESAME STREET'S EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OSCAR NOW LIVES IN TRASH CANS BESIDE RECYCLING BINS ALMA HAS A FANCY NEW BROWNSTONE APARTMENT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAS WIFE FIVE IT'S A DEPARTURE FROM THE GRITTY INNER CITY FEEL OF THE SHOW THAT DATES BACK TO THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES THE ONE
REASON SESAME STREET IS HERE FORTY FIVE YEARS LATER HIS BECAUSE WE EVOLVE AND WE LISTEN AND THAT MEDIA LANDSCAPE HAS EVOLVED AND THANKFULLY REPRESENTATION IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE THAT IS SOMETHING KIDS AND FAMILIES CAN SEE THEMSELVES REPRESENTED IN THE VAST VARIETY OF MEDIA THAT'S OUT THERE THEY LOOKING FOR ASPIRATIONAL HOLIDAYS
EVERYBODY THIS LETTER IS THE LETTER G.
OR WHAT DUCK CUTE DON'T LET THE RIDGES IS THEY'VE GOT THEY'VE GOT TO GO BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT SESAME STREET IS NOW BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE LETTER G. G. FURRED GENTRIFICATION LATE NIGHT COMEDIAN SLIGHT STEPHEN COLBERT THERE HAVE BEEN HAVING A FIELD DAY
WHAT'S NEXT COOKIE MASTERS GLUTEN FREE BURTON HERNIA DUP SENEGALESE TWINS ONE THE COUNT FINALLY SEEK TREATMENT FOR HIS HER C.D.
COUNTING WASN'T DISPLAYS DESIRED TO CONTROL MY LIFE
FACT THAT IT DOES SORT OF LOOK LIKE WILLIAMSBURG BROOKLYN LESS LIKE HARLEM IS IT GENTRIFIED PERHAPS A BEER MICHAEL DAVIS THE AUTHOR OF STREET GANG THE DEFINITIVE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAMME
SESAME STREET TRANSFORM PRE SCHOOL EDUCATION HELPING KIDS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS MORE QUICKLY LEARN THEIR NUMBERS AND LETTERS IS CENTRAL TO AMERICAN LIFE HE SAYS IT'S THE QUINTESSENTIAL NATIONAL TREASURE IT WAS A SINGULAR DELIGHT
IN MY LIFE TO SIT WITH MY DAUGHTER'S WATCH THAT SHOW
I LOVED THE PRESCHOOL ERROR WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WEAR IN FOOTIE PYJAMAS AND SAT WITH ME THEN TALKED ABOUT O.K. IS AND TALKED ABOUT WE'RE ON A COUPLE OF THANK YOU
I'M NOT BUYING THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS MOVE TO H.B.O. IS GOING TO SOMEHOW RESOLVED IN DEPRIVATION I DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL
WHAT THEY DOING GOOD
IT IS BUT PERHAPS THE FINAL WORD SHOULD GO TO ONE OF THEIR BELOVED CHARACTERS FROM THE SHOW NOT THE COOKIE MONSTER THAT'S FAIR BUT OUR OLD FRIEND ELMO EMMA KNOWS THAT WE GET SOME NURSE
SEVEN ELSE THAT YEAH YEAH WE HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THAT INCIDENT I DID YOU
AND THEY'LL REMEMBER THAT NICK BRYANT REPORTING IT IS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A LEEDS STUDIO THIS MORNING BISHOP TOM BUTLER MORNING TOM GOOD MORNING JOHN IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED AT THE ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HAS SHORTLISTED THREE EMINENT NINETEENTH CENTURY SCOTS ONE OF WHOM WILL BE PORTRAYED ON THE NEW POLYMER TEN POUND NOTE THEY ARE THOMAS TELFORD FOR THE GREAT CIVIL ENGINEER AND ARCHITECT WHO'S ROADS BRIDGES AND CANALS TRANSFORMED COMMUNICATIONS IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY
MARY SOMERVILLE THE SCIENCE WRITER WHO IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY AND THE PHYSICIST JAMES CLERK MAXWELL WHO FORMULATED THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION BRINGING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME ELECTRICITY MAGNETISM AND LIGHT AS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SAME PHENOMENON THE BREAKTHROUGH WHICH LATER LED TO RADIO COMMUNICATION AND EVENTUALLY TO THE TODAY PROGRAMME
MAXWELL HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A HERO OF MINE NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A GREAT PHYSICIST BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF HIS INSIGHTS IN BOTH SCIENCE AND RELIGION WHEN A YOUNGER PHYSICIST JAMES JOULE MADE A BREAKTHROUGH IN HIS SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOURS MAXWELL WROTE THIS NOTE TO HIM
THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE STOOD WHERE YOU STAND AND AFTER A PERIOD OF MINUTE OBSERVATION AND PATIENT MENTAL TOIL HAVE PUT THEIR MINDS INTO EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE
TO PUT YOUR MIND INTO EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE THAT SURELY IS THE OBJECTIVE OF ALL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND IN OUR TIME THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE EXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS AFTERNOON I'LL BE EVIDENCE FOR GRAVITY WAVES PREDICTED BY EINSTEIN
BUT IF TO PUT YOUR MIND IN EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE LIES AT THE HEART OF ALL SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE AS THEY ULTIMATELY ART IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE LIFE OF RELIGIOUS FAITH
FOR FAITH IN GOD IS NOT THE SAME AS HAVING A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT GOD IN FAITH YOU ARE THE APPARATUS AND YOUR LIFE IS ON THE EXPERIMENT
THIS CERTAINLY WAS MAXWELL'S OWN ATTITUDE WHEN HE APPLIED THE SAME RIGOUR TO HIS RELIGIOUS FAITH AS HE DID TO HIS SCIENCE HE WROTE NOW MY GREAT PLAN IS TO LET NOTHING THEY WILFULLY LEFT UNEXAMINED NOTHING IS TO BE HOLY GROUND CONSECRATED TO A STATION FAITH FACE ALL FALLOW LAND IS TO BE PLOUGHED UP NEVER HIDE ANYTHING BE IT WE'D ALL KNOW NOR SEEM TO WISH IT HIDDEN I ASSERT THEIR RIGHT OF TRESPASS ON ANY PLOT OF HOLY GROUND WHICH ANY MAN HAS SET APART
THOSE WERE CHALLENGING WORDS FOR A SCIENTIST TRYING TO HONOUR THE TRUTHS OF HIS SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THEY'RE EQUALLY CHALLENGING TO US TODAY WHATEVER OUR FAITH
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP TOM BUTLER IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW IT IS A QUESTION AS OLDEST DEMOCRACY HOW MUCH POWER SHOULD THE STATE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING UP TO ASSUMING WE'RE NOT BREAKING THE LAW OF COURSE AND IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT AS MORE AND MORE OF OUR LIVES ARE LIVED ON THE INTERNET TODAY A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE WILL PUBLISH ITS THOUGHTS ON WHAT'S CALLED THE DRAFT INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL WHICH IS DESIGNED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE POWERS OF THE STATE TO INTERCEPT A COMMUNICATIONS TO SNOOP ON US
IN OTHER WORDS WHAT'LL NICK CLEGG FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE WOODS INVOLVED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE GREAT DEALING YOUR HUGELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE MISTER CLEGG WHY
I THINK IN ESSENCE AND IT ALL GETS TERRIBLY TECHNICAL BUT THE THE DILEMMA AND YOU'VE JUST YOU'VE JUST TOUCHED ON IT REALLY IS IS THIS IS HOW MUCH POWER SHOULD THE BRITISH STATE HAVE ON ALL THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INTERNET INTERACTIONS THAT THE REST OF US THAT MILLIONS OF INNOCENT BRITISH CITIZENS DO EVERY DAY EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY IN ORDER TO GO AFTER THE BAD PEOPLE WHO WISH US HARM AND I THINK WHY NOT JUST MYSELF BUT IF YOU HEARD THIS WEEK THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY A FORMER CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER EXPRESSED
PROFOUND CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON PRIVACY THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COOK COMMITTEE HAVE RAISED HUGE CONCERNS ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE WILL SAY LATER TODAY BUT I EXPECT THEY WILL ALSO ECHO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WHY WHY THERE IS THIS QUICK A CONGREGATION OF CONCERN FROM ALL ALL WINGS OF POLITICAL OPINION IS BECAUSE WHAT THE HOME OFFICE ISN'T IT IN ESSENCE PROPOSING IS THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SORT OF SURVEY ALE AND ANALYSE SOMETHING THEY'RE SAYING THEY WANT TO COLLECT
EVERYTHING ON EVERYONE DRAGNET APPROACH WHICH I'VE ALWAYS FELT HIS DISPROPORTION WHAT WILL BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE HOME SECRETARY PUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU
WANT TO FIND THE NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK WHICH SOMETIMES THEY DO OBVIOUSLY UNLESS YOU'VE GOT THE HASTE ASHLEY YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T FIND IT I THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE YEAH WELL I I KNOW THE NEEDLE HAYSTACK ARGUMENT AND IT'S IT'S A SORT OF IT'S A COMFORTING ANALOGY BUT I THINK THE REALITY IS A LITTLE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHY FOR INSTANCE IS THERE NO OTHER
EUROPEAN COMMONWEALTH COUNTRY THAT THAT I KNOW OF THAT THAT PURSUES THIS DRAGNET APPROACH THE AMERICANS AND THE CANADIANS ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF ANTI TERRORISM LEGISLATION DAVID ANDERSEN TOLD HIM THAT THERE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THEM PURSUING THIS DRAGNET APPROACH THE AUSTRALIANS HAVE A PROHIBITION ON IT'S THE DANES INTERESTINGLY HAD A VERY SIMILAR POWER
FOR SOME YEARS AND THEN SCRAPPED IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED UNSURPRISINGLY THAT THE POLICE WERE WERE DROWNING IN HUGE AMOUNTS OF USELESS THAT IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SUBJECT A DIFFERENT AREA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THE STATEMENT AND THAT AND THAT IS LIKE I MEAN EFFICIENCY IS ONE THING BUT THIS IS THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN SENSE ISN'T IT AND THE OLDER I KNOW FORGIVE ME BUT IT'S THE OLDEST CLICHE IN THE BOOK BUT I'LL TRY IT ON YOU ANYWAY IF YOU'VE NOTHING TO HIDE NOTHING TO FEAR
BUT EQUALLY CONFERRING CONFERRING IMPLYING THAT EVERYONE MAY BE GUILTY WHEN MILLIONS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING ABOUT THEIR EVERYDAY BUSINESS FREE OF ANY WRONGDOING AT ALL IS ALSO SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT I THINK IN KEEPING WITH LONG STANDING BRITISH TRADITIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE BIT OF EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT POINT THEM TO THE GUILTY PERSON AS I SAY THAT ALL OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT I'M AWARE
IN EUROPE AND IN THE COMMONWEALTH TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TAKE A MORE PRECISE APPROACH A NARROW APPROACH SO THEY DON'T TAKE THIS DRAGNET APPROACH THE HOME OFFICE IN BRITAIN ALMOST UNIQUELY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HAS BEEN PEDDLING THIS IDEA WELL FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS NOW THAT YOU NEED TO CREATE
VAST VAST BUCKETS OF INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYBODY'S INTO ACTION ON THE INTERNET EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY I'M NOT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT READING OUR EMAILS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY THE NOT SO THE QUESTION IS ABOUT PROPORTIONALITY IS IT IS IT PROPORTIONATE IN A. SMALL L. LIBERAL SMALL DE DEMOCRACY IS IT PROPORTIONATE TO RETAIN INFORMATION ON EVERYTHING FROM THE MUSIC YOU DOWNLOAD ON SPOTIFY TO THE APP THAT YOU'RE OPEN TO THE SUPERMARKET WEBSITE THAT YOU VISIT IN ORDER TO GO OFF TO THE BAD GUYS AND NO OTHER
AT ALL VERY FEW OTHER COUNTRIES AS I SAY OTHER THAN RUSSIA AS FAR AS I'M AWARE OFF TAKE THIS DRAGNET APPROACH I THINK IT WOULD BE HOW DO THEY DO IT I MEAN HOW ELSE WOULD WE DO IT IF WE DIDN'T DO THIS HOW WOULD WE DO IT WILL THEY THEY TAKE A NARROW APPROACH ABOUT WHAT DATA THAT THEY THEY CAN RETAIN AND THEY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE A VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY BUT A LOT OF IT IS FOCUSING ON ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE
YOU'VE GOT A FLICKER ON THE ON THE RADAR SCREEN OFF SECURITY SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS WELL THOSE UP THERE'S A RATHER TECHNICAL BUT IMPORTANT ISSUE ABOUT THE MATCHING OF I.P. ADDRESSES A TWO A TWO HAND HELD DEVICES WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM WHICH IS WHICH IS BUT JUST FURTHER THEY GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE JEREMY RIGHT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE THIS POINT IN ONE CASE THEY SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED AND ONLINE PAEDOPHILE NETWORK
GOOD ABUSED VERY YOUNG CHILDREN FROM BEING BABIES AND THAT THAT WAS SCREENED THE CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE SAID THAT THOSE CONVICTIONS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT ACCESS TO THIS DATA
WELL OF COURSE IT WAS SUCCESSFUL UNDER EXISTING PROVISIONS SO IT'S LIKE A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT NO EXISTING PROVISIONS WERE WERE SUFFICIENT TO GO AFTER THAT PAEDOPHILE NETWORK THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD WAIT WHY WOULD WE NOW DO SOMETHING
OUT OF KEEPING WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE ON SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE AND BUY AND INCIDENTALLY ALSO POSSIBLY IMPRACTICAL SCALE AND AS I SAY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST ME AS A SORT OF LIBERAL DEMOCRAT WHO CARES ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES WHO SAYING THIS THIS IS NOW A. CHORUS OF CONCERN ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM ABOUT THE PROPORTIONALITY AND WORK ABILITY OF THE HOME OFFICE'S PROPOSALS WHICH I HOPE WILL LEAD TO THE HOME OFFICE HAVING A HAVING A RETHINK ABOUT ITS DRAFT LEGISLATION NICK CLEGG THANKS A LOT THANK YOU
IT'S THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR WEATHER FORECAST STAB TODAY AS FOR THEATRE THANK YOU SARAH GOOD MORNING TOO MANY PARTS U.K. DON'T HAVE A FINE TRY LARGELY SUNNY DAY TODAY WITH LIGHT WINDS IT WILL BE A COLD DAY THOSE MANY FOR START UP IN A VERY COLD NOTE AND THERE WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTH AND THE WEST I'LL START WITH SCOTLAND IS WHERE MOST OF THE WEATHER ACTIVITY WILL BE GOING ON TODAY IT'S A COLD START WITH SOME ICE ON UNTREATED ROADS AND PAVEMENTS
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS WILL START DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE BUT AN AREA OF RAIN SLEET AND SNOW CONTINUES TO EDGE SOUTHWARDS THROUGH THE DAY REACHING SOUTHERN AREAS INTO THE AFTERNOON SNOW MAINLY FALLING ON THE HILLS WERE POTENTIALLY DOWN TO LOWER LEVELS IN PLACE THAT TIMES DURING THE HEAVIER BURSTS BEHIND IT GUYS WILL TURN BRIGHTER IN THE NORTH IT WILL BE A COLD DAY FOR ALL THE TEMPERATURES OF THREE TO SIX CELSIUS
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A COLD MAINLY DRY START OFF FOR PATCH AROUND ONE OR TWO SHOWERS BUT THESE WERE JENNY FIZZLE OUT TO LEAVE MOST OF NORTHERN IRELAND WITH A DRY AND A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND FIVE OR SIX DEGREES SO IT WILL BE COLD FOR ENGLAND IT'S GOING TO BE A COLD AND SUNNY MORE FROSTY MORNING FEW FREEZING FOG PATCHES AROUND BUT MOST OF IT WILL BE TRIED STEAK SOME GOOD SPELLS OF SUNSHINE BEST OF THEM ACROSS THE EAST
SOUTH WESTERN IN NORTH WESTERN PARTS WILL SEE A FEW SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY THESE EDGING INTO THE WEST MIDLANDS THIS AFTERNOON WINS WILL BE LIGHTS AND TEMPERATURES AROUND FIVE TO EIGHT CELSIUS FOR WALES AS A COLD AND FROSTY START TO THE RISK OF SOME ICE BUT MAINLY DRY AND BRIGHT WITH SOME SUNSHINE THIS MORNING SHOWERS WILL AFFECT WESTERN AREAS THROUGH THE MORNING BECOME A BIT MORE FREQUENT AND WIDESPREAD IN THE AFTERNOON WITH SOME SNOW ON THE HILLS TOP TEMPERATURES SIX OR SEVEN CELSIUS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WEEK RADIO FOUR EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF ONE OF THE MOST FIERCE ENCOUNTERS OF WORLD WAR ONE SEVEN A.M. ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF FEBRUARY NINETEEN SIXTEEN THE START OF AN ARTILLERY BARRAGE LIKE NOTHING IN HISTORY TODAY
THE HISTORIAN DAVID REYNOLDS EXAMINES THE STORY AND THE LEGACY OF ONE OF THE GREAT WAR WAS MOST BRUTAL BATTLES THIS ISN'T THE FIRST MORNING AT THE SONG
WITH THE OPENING DAY OF THEN DONE A BATTLE LITTLE KNOWN IN BRITAIN BUT FOR EVER A SACRED SITE OF FRENCH NASH
DEAR DARYL BECOMES A SYMBOL OF THE FRENCH CAPACITY TO DEFEND THEIR SOIL NO MATTER WHAT THEIR DOWN THE SACRED WOUND ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR BEGINS NEXT WEDNESDAY MORNING AT ELEVEN
LATER ON THIS PROGRAMME THE COMMISSIONER OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE BERNARD PHIL GOING TO GO ON WITH THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TOO READY TO BELIEVE ACCUSATIONS OF HISTORICAL SEXUAL ABUSE AND THE SOUND OF SPACE TIME MYSTERY WILL BE REVEALED LATER
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE THE HEADLINES BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR POLICEMAN HAS SAID THAT DETECTIVES SHOULD NO LONGER ASSUME THAT SEX ABUSE COMPLAINANTS ALWAYS TELLING THE TRUTH IT'S NOT A NEW CONTRACT WILL BE IMPOSED ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND AFTER THEIR UNION REJECTED WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS A FINAL GOVERNMENT OFFER
SOUTH KOREA IS PULLING OUT OF A JOINT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IN THE NORTH IN RETALIATION FOR PYONGYANG W'S RECENT MISSILE TESTS AND THE GROWTH OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE TWITTER APPEARS TO HAVE STALLED THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE POLICE SHOULD CHANGE THEIR APPROACH TO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND NOT AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE COMPLAINANT IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE POLICY WILL BE LOOKED AT DURING THE REVIEW ANNOUNCED BY SIR BERNARD YESTERDAY OF OPERATION MIDLAND AND OTHER SCOTLAND YARD INQUIRIES INTO CLAIMS OF HISTORICAL ABUSE BY PUBLIC FIGURES ARE FORMER JUDGE SIR RICHARD HENRY CASE WILL CONDUCT THE REVIEW HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
MUCH OF THE CRITICISM OF OPERATION MIDLAND HAS REVOLVED AROUND THE COMMENTS OF A SENIOR DETECTIVE NEAR THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION HE DESCRIBED THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND MURDER MADE BY A MAN KNOWN AS NICK AS CREDIBLE AND TRUE
SPEAKING LAST NIGHT IT A B. B. C. EVENT SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOUSE AT THE OFFICER HAD MIS SPOKEN AFTER BECOMING CONFUSED BY THE NEED TO FOLLOW GUIDANCE EMPHASISING THE COMPLAINANTS MUST BE BELIEVED THE MET COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS TIME TO RID FORMULATE THAT APPROACH SO PLEASE SHOWED EMPATHY TOWARDS VICTIMS BUT RETAINED AN OPEN MIND AS THEY TRIED TO VERIFY THE ALLEGATIONS MADE
SIR BERNARD ALSO DEFENDED HIS DECISION NOT TO SAY SORRY TO THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY LORD BRAMALL WHO WAS INVESTIGATED AS PART OF OPERATION MIDLAND THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D SPENT FOUR YEARS APOLOGISING FOR THINGS HE DONE BUT IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE TO DO SO SIMPLY FOR CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION
THE LAW FIRM ISH GONDAR RARE REPRESENTED THE LATE FORMER HOME SECRETARY LORD BRITAIN WHEN HE WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY SCOTLAND YARD ONE OF THE COMPANY'S LAWYERS ALISON LEVITT TOLD US THAT THE POLICE SHOULD TEST ALLEGATIONS OF HISTORICAL ABUSE IN THE SAME WAY AS IN ANY OTHER CASE AND THAT RAIDING SUSPECT HOMES SHOULD COME ONLY AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS
MISS LEVITT A FORMER PRINCIPAL LEGAL ADVISER TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS ALSO SAID IT WAS TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED SUSPECTS ANONYMITY UNTIL THEY WERE CHARGED OR SIR BERNARD HIMSELF HAD SUGGESTED
THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION THAT IS THAT NO SUSPECT IS NAMED UP UNTIL THE POINT TO CHARGE EXCEPT WITH THE POLICE HAVING THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR EXAMPLE TO A JUDGE FOR AN ORDER TO BE MADE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PUT HER NAME UP THERE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WOULD HAVE REAL UTILITY FOR THE INVESTIGATION AS IN FOR EXAMPLE IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THERE ARE OTHER VICTIMS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT COME FORWARD BUT THE PRESUMPTION SHOULD BE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE NAMED IN THAT WOULD STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE
MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONFIRM TODAY OR TOMORROW THAT THEY WILL IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT ON JUNIOR DOCTORS IN ENGLAND A SECOND TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE BY THE DOCTOR'S PART OF THEIR LONG RUNNING DISPUTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OVER PAY AND WEEKEND WORKING HAS JUST ENDED
LAST NIGHT IT EMERGED THAT THE DOCTORS' UNION THE BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REJECTED WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SIR DAVID BELTON DESCRIBED AS A FINAL OFFER SO DAVID IS NOW EXPECTED TO TELL THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT THAT THERE'S NO REALISTIC PROSPECT OF A DEAL MORE DETAILS FROM OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT SOPHIE HUTCHINSON
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE END OF THE ROAD FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT SIR DAVID DOULTON WHO REPRESENTS MINISTERS SET A DEADLINE OF THREE P.M. YESTERDAY FOR THE DOCTORS' UNION TO AGREE TO THIS FINAL OFFER IT ADDRESSED THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF SATURDAY WORKING PROPOSING A PREMIUM RATE OF PAY FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS WORKING NOT ONE IN THREE WEEKENDS AS PREVIOUSLY BUT ONE IN FOUR HE SAID THIS WOULD MEAN MOST TRAINEE DOCTORS WHO WORKED AT THE WEEKEND WOULD GET THE PREMIUM RATE
IT ALSO INCREASED FINES FOR N.H.S. TRUSTS WHICH MAKE DOCTORS WORK MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS BUT THE B.M.A. HAS NOT AGREED TO THE TERMS LAST NIGHT IT TOLD THE B. B. C. THE OFFER WAS TINKERING NOT SUBSTANTIAL AND NOT FAIR
SIR DAVID DOULTON IS NOW EXPECTED TO SEND HIS FORMAL ADVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED JUNIOR DOCTORS IT SEEMS ARE NOW ON THE BRINK OF HAVING A NEW CONTRACT IMPOSED ON THEM
FIGURES SHOWING HOW THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND COPED IN DECEMBER WILL BE PUBLISHED LATER THIS MORNING AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO REVEAL THAT IT REMAINS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE A REPORT BY TWO LEADING HEALTH CHARITIES INDICATES THAT IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN NO RESPITE FROM THOSE WINTER PRESSURES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS MINISTERS HAVE SAID THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THE TARGET OF SAVING TWENTY TWO BILLION POUNDS A YEAR BY TWENTY TWENTY A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC HUGHES HAS BEEN TO GREATER MANCHESTER TO FIND OUT MORE
SHORTNESS OF BREATH I'M NOT IF THE A.&E. AT WIGAN INFIRMARY IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMING IN THE COUNTRY YET EVEN HERE THEY'RE FEELING THE PRESSURE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OLDER SICKER PATIENTS WHO NEED CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR A NEW JOINT REPORT BY THE NUFFIELD TRUST IN THEIR HEALTH FOUNDATION REVEALS HOW AMY WINTER PRESSURES AND NOW SUMMER PRESSURES AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE LAST SUMMER WHAT ARE KNOWN AS TROLLEY WAITS PATIENTS WAITING TO BE ADMITTED TO A WARD WERE HIGHER THAN IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR WINTERS
AMBULANCE RESPONSE TIMES ARE ALSO GETTING WORSE EACH SUMMER AND A SHARP RISE IN AMBULANCES QUEUING OUTSIDE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS SHOWS JUST HOW TOUGH LAST WINTER WAS THIS REPORT DOES SAY THAT DESPITE THE INCREASED PRESSURE THE HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND HAS COPED REMARKABLY WELL BUT IT WARNS THAT WITHOUT A SUMMER RECOVERY PERIOD AFTER A HARD WINTER THE N.H.S. RISKS GETTING TRAPPED IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL
SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES HAVE STARTED WITHDRAWING THEIR WORKERS AND PROPERTY FROM AN INDUSTRIAL PARK IN NORTH KOREA AND WHICH IS JOINTLY RUN BY THE TWO COUNTRIES SOUL SAYS IT'S HALTING OPERATIONS IN THE GAS UN COMPLEX IN RETALIATION FOR THE NORTH RECENTLY CARRYING OUT A NUCLEAR TEST AND FIRING A LONG RANGE MISSILE FROM SOUL HERE'S STEVE EVANS
THE IDEA BEHIND THE CASE ON THE INDUSTRIAL AREA WAS PARTLY TO PROMOTE AT LEAST SOME CO OPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO HALVES OF CORRIE
THAT LINK HAS NOW BEEN BROKEN WITH SOUTH KOREA DECIDING AT THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN WAGES FOR NORTH KOREAN WORKERS WAS ACTUALLY BEING USED TO HELP FUND THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMME
SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES HAVE STARTED TAKING OUT EASILY MOVABLE EQUIPMENT AND STOCKS OF FINNISH GOODS AND RAW MATERIALS
MANY NORTH KOREAN WORKERS FAILED TO TURN UP FOR WORK TODAY THEY'RE SOUTH KOREA MANAGERS CLEARED THEIR DESKS AND STARTED TO LEAVE
THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER IS EXPECTED TO USE A MEETING IN BRUSSELS THIS LUNCH TIME TO PRESS OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO MORE TO DEFEAT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP SPEAKING EARLIER THIS WEEK HE SAID AMERICA HAD A CAMPAIGN STRATEGY FOR RETAKING STRONGHOLDS IN SYRIA AND IRAQ BUT THAT MILITARY RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO PUT IT INTO OPERATION
B.T. HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL LAUNCH A NEW SERVICE LATER THIS YEAR TO DIVERT NUISANCE CALLS WITHIN ITS NETWORK BEFORE THEY GET THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS' PHONES THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO STOP TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNWANTED CALLS A WEEK SIMON COMPOS REPORTS
AT THE MOMENT B.T. CUSTOMERS CAN BUY SPECIAL PHONES WHICH BLOCK NUISANCE CALLS OR PAY TO STOP CERTAIN CALLS GETTING THROUGH BUT THE NEW SERVICE WILL IDENTIFY SOME OF THE FIVE BILLION UNWANTED CALLS MADE EACH YEAR BY MARKETING FIRMS AND CLAIMS COMPANIES BEFORE THEY ARRIVE AND DIVERT THEM TO A JUNK VOICEMAIL BOX CUSTOMERS WILL BE ABLE TO ADD NUMBERS THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM FOR FREE
THE HOPE IS THAT ACTION FROM B.T. WILL TURN THE TABLES ON NUISANCE CALLERS THOUGH IT'S NOT ENTIRELY NEW BECAUSE TALK TALK ALREADY BARS CERTAIN CALLS FOR FREE AND BLOCKS MILLION CENTRALLY
A STUDY HAS REVEALED THAT THE AVERAGE SALARY OF UNIVERSITY VICE CHANCELLOR'S NOW STANDS AT MORE THAN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND UP BY AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND LAST YEAR
UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION WHICH CARRIED OUT THE RESEARCH SAYS MORE THAN TWENTY VICE CHANCELLOR'S FLEW EXCLUSIVELY FIRST OR BUSINESS CLASS LAST YEAR WHILE STAFF SALARIES REMAIN STAGNANT THE BODY REPRESENTING UNIVERSITIES SAYS THEY'RE PAID IN LINE WITH THE HEADS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS
TWITTER HAS REPORTED ITS FIRST QUARTER WITHOUT ANY GROWTH SINCE IT FLOATED AMID GREAT FANFARE ON THE STOCK MARKET IN NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRTEEN FIGURES FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF LAST YEAR SHOW THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE HAD THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION MONTHLY USERS ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE NUMBER WHO USE FACEBOOK A REPORTER LEE IS IN SAN FRANCISCO
IF YOU DISCOUNT THE TINY AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE TWISTER UPDATES VIA TEXT MESSAGE ONLY THE SITE'S USER BASE IS ACTUALLY DECLINED BY TWO MILLION IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TWITTERS INVESTORS HAVE WORRIED ABOUT SLOW GROWTH FOR A LONG TIME CONCERNS WHICH PROMPTED THE RETURN OF CO FOUNDER JACK DORSEY WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE LAST OCTOBER
HIS IMPACT A RANGE OF NEW FEATURES AND SOME PERSONNEL CHANGES HAVE SO FAR HAD LITTLE EFFECT FOR PEOPLE CONCERNED THAT SILICON VALLEY MAY BE FACING ANOTHER BURST BUBBLE THIS HE'S BEEN TOUTED AS A REALITY CHECK
LIKE SO MANY IN SILICON VALLEY IS YET SIT EVER TURN A PROFIT AND THE SIDE THAT HAD INVESTORS FLOCKING TO BUY SHARES WHEN HE WENT PUBLIC IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IS FALLING DRASTICALLY SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS
ONE OF AFRICA'S GREATEST RUNNERS HAILE GEBRSELASSIE HAS SAID THAT RUSSIAN ATHLETE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THE RIO OLYMPICS DESPITE BEING BANNED FROM INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION OVER ALLEGATIONS OF STATE SPONSORED DOPING SPEAKING TO THE B. B. C. MISTER GEBRSELASSIE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT DRUG TESTING REGIMES IN KENYA AND ETHIOPIA NEEDED TO BE TIGHTENED FROM THE ETHIOPIAN CAPITAL ADDIS ABBA TIM FRANKS REPORTS
HAILE GEBRSELASSIE SAID THAT THE TURMOIL IN WORLD ATHLETICS LEFT HIM DEEPLY SAD BUT A MASS BAND OF RUSSIAN ATHLETES IN RIO WOULD BE WRONG BECAUSE THE INNOCENT WOULD SUFFER AND BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO BE CLEANING UP THEIR ACT
MORE COULD BE DONE CLOSER TO HOME THOUGH ETHIOPIA'S GREATEST ATHLETE SAID THE DOPING CHEQUES IN HIS COUNTRY AND NEIGHBOURING KENYA SHOULD BE IMPROVED
IT'S NO EXCUSE TO SAY THAT IN RURAL LOCATIONS IT'S DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN ATHLETES FOR TESTS MY DEBORAH SELASSIE ALSO CONFIRMED HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS MAYBE ONE DAY HE SAID HE COULD BE IN HIS COUNTRY'S PRIME MINISTER OR PRESIDENT
TIM FRANKS REPORTING TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN WE FIRST BEGAN TO LEARN ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED AT THE HANDS OF POWERFUL MEN LIKE JIMMY SADDLE THE NATION WAS UNITED IN HORROR AT THE SHEER SCALE OF IT AND THE WAY THEY'D BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH SUCH DEPRAVITY
SINCE THEN THE SOMETHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING DEEPLY DISTURBING THE ATTENTION OF MANY PEOPLE ARE SWITCHED FROM THE PERPETRATORS TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO BRING THEM TO BOOK THE POLICE
YESTERDAY BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR POLICE OFFICER AT THE METROPOLITAN COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE ANNOUNCED HE WAS SETTING UP AN ENQUIRY TO LOOKING AT THE WAY HE'S FALLS HAS BEEN CONDUCTING ITS OWN ENQUIRIES AND HE SUGGESTED THAT IN FUTURE POLICE SHOULD ADOPT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE THEY SHOULD NO LONGER AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THE PERSON MAKING THE ALLEGATION
THE TWO CASES THAT FINALLY BROUGHT SIR BERNARD TO THIS WERE THOSE OF LORD BRAMALL THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ARMY AND A WIDELY RESPECTED WAR HERO AND LORD BRITAIN A FORMER HOME SECRETARY HERE'S A FLAVOUR OF WHAT SOME OF SIR BERNARD'S CRITICS HAD BEEN SAYING ON THIS PROGRAMME ABOUT THE WAY THEY'VE BEEN TREATED
THE POLICE HELP TO DUTY'S ONE FOR THE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE BUT ANOTHER DUTY TO PEOPLE LIKE MORE BRUMMEL WHOM YES I STILL THINK THE POLICE WILL FEED THE BOMINABLE NOT A QUESTION OF DEMANDING SPECIAL TREATMENT IT'S A QUESTION OF DEMANDING A SENSE OF JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN LACKING
I THINK THE BRITTAIN FAMILY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THIS REPORT IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THERE IS EVIDENCE BUT THAT EVIDENCE HAS TO BE TESTED
YOU HEARD THE JOURNALIST AND HISTORIAN SIR MAX HASTINGS THE FORMER CHILDREN'S MINISTER TIM LOUGHTON AND THE FORMER CHANCELLOR LORD LAMONT AND SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN WHY WILL YOU NOT APOLOGISE TO HIM YOU'VE SAID YOU HAVE SYMPATHY FOR LORD BRAMALL SO WHY NOT SAY SORRY I CAN'T REALLY APOLOGISE JOHN THE FLOOR
INVESTIGATING A SERIOUS ALLEGATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE I HAVE AS YOU POINTED OUT EXPRESSED REGRET AND IT'S A GENUINE REGRET HE WILL BROWN LAURA'S FAMILY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IN THIS THIS PROCESS THIS INVESTIGATION AND I FINALLY CAUGHT OUTBURSTS BUSTER RICHARD ENRICO'S TO REVIEW
THIS UNDER THE CASE TO SEE IF THERE ARE THINGS IF WE FAILED AND TECHNOLOGY IT IF WE NEED TO LEARN FROM IT THEN LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE THAT'S A RICHARD RECENTLY LOOKED AT THE INVESTIGATION WHERE THE ALLEGATION WAS THAT THE POLICE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH
SO IT'S BETWEEN IS A GOOD PLACE TO TRY AND GIVE US SOME GOOD ADVICE FOR THE FUTURE WILL DO TWO THINGS NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO APOLOGISE FOR THE INVESTIGATION THEY ARE ASKING YOU TO APOLOGISE FOR THE WAY THE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT AT THAT'S TRUE JOHN BUT I THINK NO ONE REALLY KNOWS DO THEY IN PUBLIC WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE INVESTIGATION WE HOPE YOU DO KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IN PUBLIC PEOPLE HAVE HEARD PART OF THE INVESTIGATION AND I THINK WHAT WOULD BE BEST IF THAT SOMEONE HEARD THE INVESTIGATOR'S POINT OF VIEW ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH AND THEN WE WILL GET A BALANCED ACCOUNT I DON'T THINK THE MORE WE ARE GETTING THAT SORRY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS IS THERE A GOOD PARTY JOHN BEFORE YOU INTERRUPT
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN WE DIDN'T PUT THE NAMES OF THE SUSPECTS INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THAT'S CAUSE REAL PROBLEMS FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF COURSE THE SUSPECTS AND OF COURSE THE VICTIMS SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA DON'T YOU TO GET A VERY SENIOR RETIRED JUDGE TO LOOK AT THIS IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE DID AT THE GERMAN CASE WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T PUT THEIR NAMES INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BUT REFERENCES TO
A NINETY ONE YEAR OLD FIELD MARSHAL ET-CETERA ET-CETERA THAT GIVES THEM THE MEDIA A BIT OF A STEER DOESN'T IT BUT I COME BACK TO MY PRINCIPAL IS COMPLETELY WRONG YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT WE NEVER PUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND IT'S OFFICIALLY NO JOHN OFFICIALLY ON YES IF YOU CAN PROVE THAT THEY'RE MUCH MAKE A YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT WE NEVER PUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ABOUT A FEW MARSHALL STARTS NONSENSE
YOU SAY THEY THE INVESTIGATORS AS THOUGH THEY'RE NOT YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING THE METROPOLITAN POLICE FORCE DOES THAT IS YOUR JOB THEREFORE WHAT THEREFORE WHY DO YOU NEED AN INQUIRY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR OWN INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN DOING BECAUSE I THINK YOU WOULD NOW BE CHALLENGE ME IF I SAID LOOK I'VE LOOKED INTO THIS AND I THINK THEY'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB
THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE ANY BETTER YOU'LL BE SO MORE YOU WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T YOU SO I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE THING TO DO TO ASK AS THE D.P.P. DID
IN THE LAW JENNA CASE FOR SOMEONE INDEPENDENT TO SENIOR LEGAL MIND TO LOOK AT ALL THE EVIDENCE LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS CASE IT'S GONE FORWARD NOT JUST THE PARTS THEY WERE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THEREFORE MAKE IT PUBLIC THE RESULT
WHAT WE WILL DO AS IN THE THE JANNA CASES TO MAKE PUBLIC THEIR SOMEWHERE THAT SIR RICHARD WILL WILL PUBLISH THE DANGER YOU HAVE IT OF COURSE IF YOU PUBLISH EVERYTHING YOU MADE FURTHER DAMAGE A SUSPECT YOU CERTAINLY RUN THE RISK OF DAMAGING VICTIMS AND YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT ON WITNESSES AND WE GET A LOT OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN BUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN PUT THERE AS SIR RICHARD DID IMAGE ON CASE WE WERE PUT THERE
YOU SEE YOU TALK ABOUT PUTTING THINGS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IF TWENTY POLICE OFFICERS TURN UP AT THE HOME OF A RETIRED FIELD MARSHAL IN A LITTLE VILLAGE AT DAWN OR CLOSE TO DAWN THEY GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS THEN THEY GO OFF TO THE LOCAL PUB AND HAVE LUNCH AND THEN THEY GO BACK
IT IS LITERALLY ISN'T IT SIR BERNARD INCONCEIVABLE BUT PEOPLE WILL NOT KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED INCONCEIVABLE
JOHN FIRST OF ALL THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MAESTRO RICHARD TO LOOK AT IT LET'S LA DID THAT HAPPEN OR DID IT NOT JONAH IF YOU LET ME ANSWER THE QUESTION TO THE BEST
WE'LL GIVE SIR RICHARD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THAT AND I'M NOT GOING TO TALK THEREFORE ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THIS CASE OR ANY OF US COS THERE ARE OTHER ASPECTS TO IT THERE ARE STILL ONGOING BUT I'LL POINT THIS OUT TO PEOPLE IF WE HAVE TO SEARCH HER PROPERTY WILL TAKE MORE THAN ONE OFFICER IF YOU WANT TO DO IT PROPERLY IT WILL TAKE MANY TWENTY
WELL ACTUALLY IF YOU JUST CONSIDER YOUR OWN HOME HOW MUCH PAPERS
HOW MANY ARE RESOLVED WHERE THEY AT A DISCO OR A SMALL CHIP CAN BE SECRETED IF WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR THAT AND I'M NOT SEEING THIS CASE YOU WERE BUT TO SEARCH PROPERLY A PROPERTY AND SIR SAY THAT WE'VE DONE IT WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO DO IT QUICKLY YOU'LL HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON BUT YOU STARTED THIS WHOLE PROCESS ON THE BASIS
PRESUMABLY AND SUE SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE IN DETAIL WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU STARTED IT PRESUMABLY ON THE BASIS OF AN ALLEGATION BY A VICTIM SO CALLED OTHERWISE PERHAPS A GENUINE VICTIM PERHAPS NOT WE DON'T KNOW
ON THAT BASIS SHOULD YOU NOT HAVE WAITED UNTIL YOU HAD ESTABLISHED A LOT MORE ABOUT THE CASE BEFORE YOU LAUNCH THIS DAWN RAID JOHN I THINK YOU'VE JUST ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION VERY REASON PROPERTY ASKING SIR RICHARD TO LOOK AT THIS IT'S SO THEY CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE CASE
AND IN THE CASE OF COURSE THAT INVESTIGATION AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNS COMPLETELY AS FAR AS OTHERS ARE CONCERNED HE'S NOT SO I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO GIVE HIM THAT SPACE TO DO THAT AND IF YOU CONCLUDE THAT WE COULD DO IT BETTER OF COURSE WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE ALL RIGHT DOES THIS MAYBE OF COURSE THAT HE DISCOVERS THAT THERE ARE THINGS THERE THAT AREN'T IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT EFFECT TO THE WHERE THE INVESTIGATION WENT FORWARD
WHICH DIDN'T HELP MO BRUMMEL BUT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE OVERALL INVESTIGATION OR CAMP CAN WE ASSUME THAT WE'VE NOW SEEN THE END OF THE POLICE TRAWLING FOR
VICTIMS I PUT THE WORD VICTIMS IN INVERTED COMMAS WHEN I PUT THE WORD TRAWLING INVEST IN COMMAS WELL NO WELL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU MADE ABROAD ALLEGATION GO I'M GOING TO ANSWER IT ALL RIGHT DO YOU WANT TO DIE TELL HIM YOU'VE JUST DEFINED THE WORD TRAWL WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE COME FOR I WAS ABOUT TO BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME WELL YOU STARTED IT YOU CAN USE THE WORD I'M TRYING TO JUST DRAG A JUSTIFICATION THE THE WORD TRAWLS IT INDICATES THAT WE'RE JUST GOING OUT LOOKING FOR
COMPLAINTS WHEN IN FACT THE OBVERSE IS TRUE ISN'T IT NO PEOPLE CONTINUED SUPERINTENDENT KENNY LOOKED ON ALL OF THIS IS AN APPEAL FOR VICTIMS IF THAT ISN'T ALL IN GODBER'S WHAT IS WELL WHICH IS IT IS IT A TROLL FIRST OF ALL THE WORD TRAWLERS PEJORATIVE TERM INDICATE YOU WERE LOOKING FOR VICTIMS THAT DON'T EXIST TO MAKE THINGS UP AS IT WELL WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY HAVE A VICTIM TO COME FORWARD IF THEY WANT TO COMPLAIN AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN PART OF THE MEDIA
THAT HAS ACTUALLY SAID THAT IN FACT IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN COVER UPS IN FACT YOU'VE PEOPLE FROM ESTABLISHMENT HAVE BEEN COMPLAINED ABOUT PEOPLE NOT ONLY IGNORED IT WOULD COVER IT UP ARE WE TRYING TO DO IS TO POINT OUT THAT IF PEOPLE DO WANT TO COME FORWARD WE ALWAYS OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A LISTEN TO THEIR CLAIMS AND THEN OF COURSE WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE YES BUT I SUGGESTED THAT WHAT
SUPERINTENDENT KENNY MCDONALD WAS DOING WHEN HE SAID THIS INCIDENTALLY IS THE MAN WHO SAID THAT NICK THE CHARACTER WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HIS ACCOUNT WAS CREDIBLE AND TRUE AND I KNOW ONE YOU'VE NO RESULT FROM THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT ONE WONDERS WON'T COOK QUITE SO LONG FOR THAT TO BE HONEST BUT THE FACT IS HE SAID THIS IS AN APPEAL FOR VICTIMS HE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THAT FIRST ORDER IN TERMS OF WHAT HE SAID ABOUT CREDIBLE AND TRUE Y. MIS SPOKE IT WAS ACTUALLY WASN'T YESTERDAY THAT WE'VE SAID
WE ACCEPT THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO SAY MY SPOKEN WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT FAIRLY QUICKLY HOW QUICKLY WAS FAIRLY QUICKLY I CAN'T REMEMBER THE DAY BUT LACED POSSIBLY AGREE THAT IT WASN'T SIX MONTHS IT WAS A MATTER OF DAYS OR THING THAT I THINK THE CRITICAL POINT SURELY SURELY THE PRINCIPAL POINT IS THIS IS WHAT HE AND WE TOGETHER WITH THE PRESS DO REGULARLY IS TRUST THE WITNESSES
AND IF PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD AND TO BE CONFIDENT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL LISTEN TO THEM AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY PERTINENT SURELY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF POWER ARE SURE THAT SOMETHING WE MUST AGREE ON A COURSE WHETHER OR NOT THIS THIS INVESTIGATION COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED BETTER I WANT TO KNOW AS WELL BUT I CAN'T LOOKING TO EVERY ENQUIRY THAT WE CARRY OUT WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CRIMES IN LONDON A YEAR
IF WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO LOOK INTO A ONES INVOLVING THINGS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE PRESS THEN I DON'T THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE WAY FORWARD ALL RIGHT LET'S TRY AND WIDEN THAT THEN THE PRESUMPTION THAT A VICTIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE BULLIED SHOULD BE INSTITUTIONALISED THAT'S WHAT HER MAJESTY'S INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY SAID ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO YOU
BELIEVE THAT NOW THE POLICE SHOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW YES WELL IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT I'M NOT I'M NOT TRYING TO BE ABOUT IT WAS MAKING THE POINT ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO I DO DAME AILISH ANGELINI
WHO USED TO BE THE SAUCE TO GENERAL IN IN SCOTLAND AND IS NOW THE PRINCIPAL SAINT HUGH'S COLLEGE IN OXFORD TO LOOK AT THE WAY GENERALLY WE MIGHT INVESTIGATE RAPE CONTEMPORARY REPORTS OF RAPE
IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHAT DID WE NEED TO DO TO GET ON THE GEAR TO GET HER A GREAT WAY OF DEALING WITH THESE TERRIBLE OFFENCES AND NOT JUST WHAT WE DO NOW JUST LOOK FORWARD
ONE OF THINGS THAT THEY MAY HAVE REMARKED ON THEN WAS THAT SHE THOUGHT THIS BELIEF THAT THING WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE SHE THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO TREAT ALLEGATIONS AS THOUGH TRUE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CAN'T INVESTIGATE AT LEAST THERE'S SOME THAT THING IN THERE BUT I THINK WE'VE REALLY GOT HUNG ON THE BOMB THIS WORD OF BELIEF IS CONFUSED OFFICERS AND MY POINT WOULD BE WITH COURSE GOT TO BE EMPATHETIC
WE WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO THEM WE WANT TO BE OPEN MINDED WHAT THEY TELL US AND THEN WHAT THE SUSPECTS TELL US AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO TEST ALL THE EVIDENCE AND I THINGS A GRAVE DANGER AT THE MOMENT WITH THE ADVICE IT'S AROUND
THAT PIT OUCH THERE'S A TENDENCY TO THINK THAT WE WILL ALWAYS BELIEVE ANY COMPLAINT THAT HE'S MADE AND THAT'S NOT WHITER AND ANY GOOD INVESTIGATOR NOR AS IT WOULD BE FRIENDS YOU'RE A VET IS OBVIOUSLY A SLIGHT RISK IN THIS THAT DO YOU SWING THE PENDULUM TOO FAR IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN COMING FORWARD WITH GENUINE CAUSE MAY NOT COME FORWARD IN FUTURE
THE JOHN IF THAT HAPPENED IT WOULD BE THE THIRD TIME IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS WOULDN'T IT ABSOLUTELY YOU REMARK YOURSELF OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO IF IT WASN'T A MORAL PANIC IT WAS VERGING ON IT WHEN IT WAS ALLEGED THAT A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD IGNORED A DOSSIER
HAD ALSO BEEN ACCUSED OF OFFENCES THEMSELVES AND INVITE EVERYBODY WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT HADN'T HAPPENED AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SUGGESTING THERE IS A RISK THAT THAT'S THE WAY I'M JUST I THINK IT'S NOT UNFAIR TO POINT OUT THAT WE THEN THEN WE NOW ER GOT THE DOUBLE JUSTICE GODDARD INQUIRING LOOKING AT THEIR VERY ALLEGATION WE ARE NOW BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING A WITCH HUNTERS THAN DOING IT IN A VERY YOU KNOW VERY INAPPROPRIATE WAY AND I'M PREPARED TO LOOK AT THAT AND THAT'S WHY I SET UP THIS REVIEW BUT YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT IF WE GET THIS WRONG
BETWEEN NOT JUST THE POLICE BUT SOCIETY LAWYERS ET-CETERA PEOPLE WON'T COME FORWARD AND SHOW YOU WHAT WE ALL WANT TO HAPPEN PARTICULARLY A CHILD TODAY WAS TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT SOMEBODY'S NOT THERE HANG THEM OUT TO DRY
AND THAT THEY'LL ROOT BACKGROUND WE LOOKED INTO IF THEY MAKE AN ALLEGATION SO WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT AND I THINK THAT SIR RICHARD WORK WILL HELP US WITH THAT I KNOW THAT HE IS KEEN TO TRY AND DEVELOP A CODE OF PRACTICE WITH OTHERS TO SEE WHETHER HIS KNOTS WITH SOME COUPE WE CAN ALL RIGHT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT CASE
JUST A FINAL THOUGHT YOUR CRITICS WILL SAY ARE SAYING INDEED THAT YOU SET UP THIS INQUIRY EAT TO PROTECT YOUR OWN JOB TO SAVE YOUR OWN JOB YOUR TERM OF OFFICE IS COMING TO AN END YOU ON ANOTHER FIVE YEARS PRESUMABLY I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU'VE ACTUALLY FORMALLY CONFIRM THAT OR NOT BUT YOU'RE ONE OF THE FIVE YEARS THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE IT
WELL THEY HAVE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEIR VIEW BUT I WHEN I WHEN I HEARD YOU IN THE JOB THIRTY ODD YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN OATH THEN SAID WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT SO I DO MY JOB TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY WITHOUT FEAR AND WITHOUT FAVOUR OF ANYBODY WITH DICK THESE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATORS AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO REALLY BE BALANCED IN THE WAY THAT WE GO FORWARD ON THESE ARE NOT AS YOU FOR YOURSELF ACKNOWLEDGED OVER REACT AT TIMES SO I THINK THE OTHER WAY FORWARD IS FAIRLY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A LOOK I DIDN'T SET UP AN INQUIRY TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM ME
I SET UP THIS INQUIRY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I CAN'T SEE WHY I WAS CRITICISED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS FOR SAY NOTHING I SAY SOMETHING SO THIS IS THE WAY FORWARD AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DIVERT HOW DO YOU A FIVE I'M ON THE POINT OF SAINT GERMANS MIGHT WANT IT BOTH WAYS GOOD HEAVENS NOT THAT I'M SURE THAT'S NOT LIKE A SHOCKING BUT YOU KNOW ONE ANOTHER FIVE YEARS YOU KNOW WORKED VERY CONSISTENT ALL ALONG THERE WERE CAME IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I'VE SAID
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN THE MET FOR UP TO SEVEN YEARS I USE THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT ANY LEADER SHOULD GIVE AWAY WHEN THEY ARE GOING BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR FINAL YEAR IS YOU ARE DISMISSED I'VE NO INTENTION OF BEING DISMISSED SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT'S NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE PRIME MINISTER IS PLANNING A RESHUFFLE AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG IS HEARING SHE JOINS US NOW LAURA SICK GOOD MORNING WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE HEARING WHAT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT
LOOK THEY'LL LAUGH IT OFF FOR NOW BECAUSE GOVERNMENTS ALWAYS DO NUMBER TEN WON'T COUNTENANCE ANY DISCUSSION AT ALL HAVE A RESHUFFLE AFTER THE THEORETICAL GOVERNMENT VICTORY THEY HOPE FOR AT THE END OF JUNE IN THE REFERENDUM BUT SEVERAL SOURCES HAVE TOLD ME THIS IS VERY MUCH ON THE CARDS
ONE SOURCE TOLD ME A UNITY RESHUFFLE IS BEING PLANNED TO PULL THE TORIES BACK TOGETHER AFTER THE CAMPAIGN TO SHOW THAT THE CONSERVATIVES CAN HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE THEY CAN POLITELY DISAGREE AND THEN THEY CAN COME TOGETHER AFTERWARDS WHEN SENIOR MINISTER TOLD ME THERE'S BOUND TO BE A RESHUFFLE AND MAYBE QUITE A BIG ONE OF THE SENIOR TEAM
IT MIGHT BE DAVID CAMERAS MOST WIDE RANGING RESHUFFLE EVER HE'S NOT BEEN FOND OF MOVING MINISTERS AROUND HE'S BELIEVED IN ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE TIME IN THE JOB BUT AFTER THE PERIOD OF POLITE AND PERMITTED DISAGREEMENT IT SEEMS VERY MUCH HER ON THE CARS TO DO WHAT ONE SENIOR MINISTER DESCRIBED TO ME AS AN OVERARCHING NEED TO BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GOVERNOR AFTER THE CAMPAIGN AND I SUPPOSE THOUGH POLITICALLY CANNY TO PUT THAT OUT NOW AHEAD OF ANY DISAGREEMENTS
WELL OF COURSE NUMBER TEN SAY LOOK THIS IS THIS IS NONSENSE THERE FOCUS COMPLETELY ON THE RENEGOTIATION IN THEN ON TRYING TO WIN THE REFERENDUM BUT LOOK THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AMONGST MINISTERS AND LIKELY TO BE A SENIOR JOB FOR BORIS JOHNSON MAYBE AS HOME SECRETARY OR EVEN DEFENCE
WITH A MOVE INTERN FOR THERESA MAY MAY BE TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE MISTER JOHNSON TURNED DOWN A CABINET JOB AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION WE KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER PROMISED THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER OFFER THERE'S SUGGESTION MICHAEL FALLON THE CURRENT DEFENCE SECRETARY COULD REPLACE CHRIS GRAYLING IS THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND SO THE CHESS PIECES GET MOVED ON AND ON AND ON ACROSS THE BOARD NOW LOOK WE SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT NONE OF THIS IS CERTAIN POLITICS IS VERY FEBRILE AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S FOOLHARDY TO PREDICT VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WITH REAL SERAIT INTI
BUT WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE IN OUR MINDS AS MINISTERS ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH SIDE TO TAKE IN THE CAMPAIGN WE SHOULDN'T BE IN ANY DOUBT THAT THEIR FUTURES I HALF DID THE PUBLIC VOTE ARE JUST AS MUCH OF A PREOCCUPATION AS THE PRINCIPLES OF WHETHER OR NOT TO BACK STAY OR GO IN THE REFERENDUM ITSELF OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW THE OUTCOME INDEED I JUST FOR LABELLING POINT OF LABOUR'S POINT OF VIEW THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT HAVING SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE REFERENDUM IN THE DEBATE
YES BUT THERE ARE SOME NERVES INTERNALLY ABOUT JUST HOW COMMITTED IS JEREMY CORBIN TOO DID YOU CAUSE JUST HAD PROMINENT AS THE PARTY GOING TO BE IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND IN FACT THE SHADOW HER SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY HILARY BENN IS MAKING A SPEECH TO HAVE ANY MOMENT NOW IN FACT ON THAT THE LABOUR CASE FOR STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE INTERNATIONALIST CASES YOU'RE FREE
AND I THINK YOU'LL BE MAKING ACTUALLY QUITE A STRONG INTERVENTION THIS MORNING PAT PERHAPS TO TRY TO PUT SOME STEEL INTO THE SPINE OF ANY WAVERING OVER THE Y. YOU ON HIS SIDE OF THINGS AND I UNDERSTAND IF YOU PUT THIS IN QUITE AN INTERESTING CONTEXT MAKING A WARNING THAT COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN HOSTILE INTENT TO THE U.K. RECENTLY MIGHT BE RATHER PLEASED IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. WHAT MIGHT HE BE TALKING ABOUT SOME IN BRUSSELS BUT NO SENIOR BRITISH POLITICIAN YET
HAVE WARNED THAT ONE VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT BE RATHER HAPPY IF BRITAIN TURNS FOR THE EXIT HILARY BENN IF HE DOES THAT THIS MORNING WOULD BE THAT THEY FIRST SENIOR BRITISH POLITICIAN TO PUT THAT WARNING INTO THIS DEBATE AND THAT MIGHT BECOME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS HOTLY DEBATED IN MONTHS TO COME NORA BAG THANK YOU

SUNSHINE FEELING COLD SHOWERS IN PLACES YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES LET'S HAVE THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE HAS DEFENDED HIS FORCES HANDLING OF HISTORICAL SEXUAL ASSAULTS BUT SAID HE NOW THOUGHT THE POLICE SHOULD DROP THE PRESUMPTION THAT OFFICERS SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE COMPLAINANTS SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME SO BERNARD AGAIN REFUSED TO APOLOGISE TO THE OLD BRAMWELL FOR THE WAY AN ALLEGATION AGAINST HIM WAS INVESTIGATED HE SAID HE REGRETTED ANY HURT TO THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES AND HIS FAMILY
DOCTORS LEADERS HAVE REJECTED A FINAL OFFER MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO SETTLE A BIT A CONTRACT DISPUTE IN ENGLAND IT'S EXPECTED THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEADLOCK MINISTERS WERE ANNOUNCED THAT A NEW CONTRACT WILL BE IMPOSED ON JUNIOR DOCTORS
A REPORT IS WARNING THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS FACING GROWING PRESSURE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCE DURING THE WINTER IN RECENT YEARS THE STUDY BY TWO LEADING HEALTH CHARITIES ALSO INDICATES THAT LAST WINTER WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ON RECORD
AN INDIAN SOLDIER WHO WAS FOUND ALIVE AFTER BEING BURIED FOR SIX DAYS IN AN AVALANCHE HAS DIED HE'D BEEN TRAPPED UNDER TWENTY SIX FEET OF SNOW ON THE GLACIER IN INDIAN ADMINISTERED KASHMIR
THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE EVER SINCE EINSTEIN PROPOSED HIS THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF GRAVITY WAVES TODAY THEY'RE EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THEY FOUND THEM
QUITE A BIG MOMENT THE CLAIM'S BEEN MADE BEFORE MARCH TWENTY FOURTEEN BY AN AMERICAN TEAM CALLED BICEP TOO THIS IS WHAT PROFESSOR STEPHEN HAWKING SAID AT THE TIME ABOUT THAT RESEARCH
INFLATION LEARNER IT GRAVITATION ALWAY
DIRECTOR OF SPACE TIME
OR A DISTINGUISHED
BUT YESTERDAY HER TEAM ANNOUNCED THAT ACT OF GRAVITATIONAL FROM
WE SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT STRANGE NOISE BEHIND PROFESSOR HAWKING ALMOST ALMOST A CHIRPING NOISE RELEASE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THAT IS WHAT GRAVITY MIGHT SOUND LIKE SCIENTIST M.I.T. TURNED THE DATA FROM THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES INTO SOUND AND THAT'S WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH THAT TWENTY FOURTEEN DISCOVERY TURNED OUT TO BE A FALSE ALARM THEY HADN'T FOUND CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
LATER TODAY THOUGH SOME OTHER RESEARCHERS WILL UNVEIL THE RESULTS OF THEIR SEARCH AND THIS TIME WE'RE EXPECTING MORE DEFINITIVE PROOF DOCTOR CAROLINE CRAWFORD IS PUBLIC ASTRONOMER AT THE INSTITUTE OF ASTRONOMY
AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
IF IT HAPPENS AS WE ARE EXPECTING IT WOULD BE QUITE A MOMENT IT WILL REALLY MARK A NEW ERA OF ASTRONOMY IT IS SO EXCITING IF THIS IF THIS REALLY IS THE FIRST CLEAR DETECTIONS WE'RE EXPECTING OH KAY IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO EXPLAIN TO US HOW THEY DETECTED THESE WAVES WHAT THEY DID
WELL A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE IS IT'S A RIPPLE BUT IT'S THAT TRAVELS ACROSS SPACE TIME I MIGHT HAVE A KIND OF WAY TO BE USED IT'S ACTUALLY TRAVELLING DISTORTION IN THE SHAPE OF SPACE ITSELF
SO THAT MEANS THAT ANY SPACE IS BEING STRETCHED IN ONE DIRECTION AND COMPRESSED AND STRETCHED AND COMPRESS SO WHAT THE DETECTIVES IN THIS EXPERIMENT LIGO AND U.S. ARE LOOKING FOR IT'S A VERY CHARACTERISTIC STRETCH AND SQUASH SIGNATURE BECAUSE THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE TRAVELS THROUGH SPACE IT DISTORTS IT IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY AND ANYTHING IN THE SPACE AS WELL SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOU NOR TWO LENGTHS AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEM TO CHANGE IN THIS VERY
DEFINITE PATTERN THAT MEANS A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE IS PASSING THROUGH THE DETECTOR AND OFTEN WE'RE TOLD TO IMAGINE A BALL ON A STRETCH CHEAT WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY BENDING THE SHEET AS IT MOVES AND THAT'S WHAT THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVE WOULD BE WELL A BOUGHT A HEAVYWEIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A TORCH
PRODUCES A CURVE AROUND THE SHAKE THAT'S A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF HOW EINSTEIN SAID THAT GRAVITY DISTORTS THE SHAPE OF SPACE AROUND A HEAVY MASS THE THING BACK GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IS IF THAT MASSIVE OBJECT IN BE A STAR OR A PLANET A BLACK HOLE BEGINS TO MOVE
THE SHAPE OF THE SPACE IS GOING TO MOVE AROUND IT AND THAT'S WHAT SETS UP THIS DISTURBANCE IS WHAT SETS UP THE GRAVITATIONAL WEIGHT THAT THEN RIPPLE OUTWARDS FROM THE DISTURBANCE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND IT'S THOSE RIPPLES THAT THIS DETECTOR WE'RE HOPING HE'S PICKED UP IF WE ARE ABLE TO DETECT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE BECAUSE I MEAN THE THUS FAR THE RISK OF STATING THE OBVIOUS WE CAN DETECT LIGHT WE CAN SEE IT SO WE KNOW IF SOMETHING IS THERE OR ISN'T THERE AND IT'S EFFECTIVELY
PROGRESS OVER TIME IF WE CAN DETECT A GRAVITY HOW CAN WE USE
THE THING IS EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE IS PULLED AROUND IS SUBJECT TO GRAVITY BUT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE GRAVITY ITSELF AS YOU SAY A NORMAL TELESCOPES CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE LIGHT RADIATED BY OBJECTS HIS MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONTROLLED BY GRAVITY
THE TROUBLE IS THAT LIGHT WAVES AS SOMETIMES OBSCURED BY SURROUNDING MATTER THEY GET EASILY BLOCKED OR SCATTERED THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET TO US ON EARTH THE THING ABOUT GRAVITATION WAVES AS THEY CAN PASS THROUGH SOLID OBJECTS AND SO ONE DAY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE REGIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY COMPLETELY OBSCURED FROM A SITE AND THESE COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE
HER BLACK HOLES OR NEUTRON STARS ARE FORMED IN THE COLLAPSE OF MASSIVE STARS OR EVEN MORE EXCITINGLY THE VERY MUM TO THE BIG BANG THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF OUR UNIVERSE ARE COMPLETELY BLOCKED THE FRONT VIEW THERE'S A SORT OF FOG WE CALLED COGS TO MAKE MICROWAVE BACKGROUND THAT OBSCURES THE UNIVERSE WHEN IT WAS YOUNGER THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OLD
BUT GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT RIGHT IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND THEY CAN ESCAPE THROUGH THIS FOG SO ONE DAY OUR EXPERIMENTS MIGHT EVEN BE SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO PICK THOSE UP AND WE CAN START TO EXAMINE THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF THE UNIVERSE OH CASE IT WOULD BE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THAT WE WOULD BE USING TO DETECT THAT SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL MOMENT OF EXISTENCE WELL YES AND TO START ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING SOME OF US THE PHYSICS IT'S GOING ON IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE THAT IS COMPLETELY INACCESSIBLE TO US OBSERVATIONAL EH
WE JUST STUDY BY A THEORY AND THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS DASHI HAVE DATA WOULD BE FANTASTIC O.K. SO TO GET EXCITED ABOUT THE CHIRPING IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT IS DEFINITELY A NEW ERA FOR ASTRONOMY THIS IS A REAL GAME CHANGER IF THIS DETECTION IS AS WE EXPECT DOCTOR KAREN CRAWFORD THANKS SO MUCH
TWENTY TWO AND I WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT THE WORLD IS FACING A CRISIS BECAUSE ANTIBIOTICS ARE LOSING THEIR POWER TO DEFEAT SOME OF THE DEADLIEST DISEASES WILL THE MAN WHO WAS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO LOOK INTO THIS CRISIS WILL SOON BE PRESENTING HIS FINAL REPORT ON TO THE PRIME MINISTER ON WHAT CAN BE DONE HE'S GOT ANOTHER PART OF THAT REPORT ABOUT THAT THIS MORNING HE'S LORD O'NEILL JIMINY OLD MORNING RONNIE
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE AT LEAST AS IT STANDS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE AND IT IS ALREADY THE FACT THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING RESISTANCE HAD DEVELOPED RESISTANCE OR RATHER THE BUGS HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN RESISTANCE MEANS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE THERE'S THAT IS A FACT
IT LOOKS THAT WAY AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING MORE QUICKLY TO FIND SOME MORE IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY ESCALATE SIGNIFICANTLY
COMING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING AT THE MOMENT ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TODAY WE BELIEVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE DYING FROM SOME KIND OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE RESISTANCE RELATED ILLNESS AND BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY IS GOING TO BE TEN MILLION THAT IS HAN A STAGGERING FIGURE ISN'T IT A LOT AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TODAY IS THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING IN OTHER AREAS IN VACCINES IN PARTICULAR
YES SO WE WE CAN I HAVE THIS HUNCH EARLY ON BUT AS A WHOLE APPROACH HAS BEEN TO TAKE A SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE CHALLENGE AND FIFTH HOME IN AND FOCUS ON THEM WITH A SPECIALIST PAPER THIS ONE IS ABOUT THE ROLE OF VACCINES AND ALTERNATIVES
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IN THE EMERGING WORLD AND ALL OVER THE WORLD IN AGRICULTURE IN SOME SPECIFIC CASES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD WITH WITH THE VERY SPECIALIST VACCINES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TAKE PNEUMONIA WE HAVE THIS PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE WHICH
IN MOST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD IS USED VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND IT STOPS THE THE RISK FOR SO MANY YOUNG CHILDREN AND WE DON'T ALL GET IT WE DO ALL GUESS IT BUT AND SHOULD WE IN THE EMERGING WORLD VERY FEW PEOPLE GO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA TODAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET THEIR VACCINE SO AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IF THEY DID IT WILL DRAMATICALLY COURTS
THE NEED FOR ANY ANTIBIOTIC FOR THOSE T.B. OF THE TEN MILLION WE ESTIMATE THAT WE DO ALL GET THAT DRIVING THE DID A WEIRDO BUT NOT NOT IN THE WORLD AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THE TEN MILLION THAT WE'RE ESTIMATING TWENTY FIFTY ONE THIRD OF THOSE WILL BE FROM T.B. RELATED ILLNESS RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT SAYING
WE SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON DEVELOPING NEW VACCINES BECAUSE THAT THAT ITSELF TAKES TEN YEARS TO DEVELOP ANTIBIOTICS FOR TEN YEARS PRESUMABLY TO DEVELOP A NEW VACCINE AS WELL WE ARE WE'RE SAYING TWO THINGS WERE SAYING FIRST OF ALL THE USEFUL VACCINES THAT EXIST NEEDS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE RIGHT PRICE FOR THOSE ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT CAN'T AFFORD IT AND IT IS AT THE MOMENT IT'S MONEY IS IT IT IS ECONOMIC IT IS ECONOMICS
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IN THIS PART OF OUR THINKING ABOUT SO CALLED GOVEY WHICH IS AN APPROACH INTRODUCED MANY YEARS AGO TO BRING VACCINES AT A MORE AFFORDABLE PRICE BY ESSENTIALLY GUARANTEEING THE INCOME STREAM TO ENCOURAGE PHARMA COMPANIES TO PRODUCE THEM WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THAT BUT WE ARE JOHN SAYING THAT THERE SHOULD BE NEW VACCINES AS WELL BECAUSE FOR SOME VERY SPECIALIST ILLNESSES GONORRHOEA
HE CAROLI THERE WERE NO VACCINES IN EXISTENCE AND IF YOU COULD DEVELOP THOSE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR ANY ANTIBIOTICS COS SHOULD PREVENT THE ILLNESS IN THE FIRST WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO SAY WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT VACCINES BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER BE QUITE SURE WHAT THEY'LL DO TO YOU AND MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY AND VACCINATE OURSELVES AGAINST EVERYTHING COS THEN THE REST OF THE BODY YOU WANT
WHAT IT'S MEANT TO DO OF COURSE THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF SCARE STORIES WHICH WHICH ENDED UP BEING VERY INCORRECT ACTUALLY WELL WELL KNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T JUST RUSH BRUV VACCINES FOR THE SAKE OF IT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY GO THROUGH THE CRINAN CLINICAL TRIAL PROCESS BUT WHAT IS CLEARLY THE BROADER
RISKS THAT THE WORLD IS FACING AN ALL OF THOSE SEVEN BILLION AROUND THE WORLD IS THAT A BIGGER ROLE FOR VACCINES WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON IT YET BUT IN AGRICULTURE IN PARTICULAR THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCARE STORIES RECENTLY WHICH IS QUITE RIGHTLY MAKING MORE PEOPLE WAKE UP IS THE SO CALLED COOLEST IN EXAMPLE IN CHINA ARE LAST OF LINE ANTIBIOTIC WHICH HAS BEEN OVER USED FOR TREATING PIGS
WHY COULD YOU NOT ESSENTIALLY PRICE MECHANISMS HAS TO MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT IF NOT BROWN THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN ANIMALS AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO SUBSIDISE OR IN SEVENTY FIVE THE USE OF VACCINES IN AGRICULTURE ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THAT'S THE ECONOMIST TALKING NOT THE SCIENTIST VERY WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE THAT'S CORRECT CAMILLE THANKS A LOT PLEASURE
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO NINE THE DOCTORS IN ENGLAND HAVE SAID NO AGAIN ONLY THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WAS THE LAST OFFER THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO MAKE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD IMPOSE ITS NEW CONTRACT ON DOCTORS IN ENGLAND AS EARLY AS TODAY PROFESSOR CHRIS HAM IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE THINK TANK THE KING'S FUND AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME GOOD MORNING MORNING CAN YOU THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING BEFORE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN AN OCCASION WHEN A CONTRACT HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON JUNIOR DOCTORS THE LAST BIG DISPUTE WAS AS FAR BACK AS NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN BARBARA CASTLE WAS THE HEALTH SECRETARY THAT EVENTUALLY GOT RESOLVED WITH THE JUNIORS THROUGH NEGOTIATION BUT IN POSITION EITHER UNUSUAL IN THE EXTREME OR NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE O.K. SO SAY WE HAVE IT AND IT ALL THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WHAT'S THE REACTION OF DOCTORS I'M INTO ARE WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE STRIKES ARE WE GOING TO SEE LEGAL CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLAYING UP OR THE GREAT TRAGEDY HERE SARAH IS COMPLETE LOSS OF TRUST BETWEEN THE DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT THE B.M.A. AND THE NEGOTIATORS HAVE BEEN SITTING DOWN EVEN WITH THE EXPERT INPUT OF DAVID DALTON CHIEF EXEC OF SALFORD ROYAL HOSPITAL THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH A COMPROMISE IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THEY CAN FIND COMMON GROUND SO YES
I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE INDUSTRIAL ACTION PATIENT CARE WILL BE AFFECTED I KNOW THAT SENIOR DOCTORS HAVE BEEN STEPPING IN TO SUPPORT HOSPITALS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO MINIMISE THE DISRUPTION FOR PATIENTS I'M SURE THAT WILL CONTINUE BUT THE PUBLIC IT SEEMS DO SUPPORT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS ACTION AS LONG AS THAT CONTINUES I DON'T SEE A SETTLEMENT INSIGHT AND GIVEN WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE FEELING AMONGST THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HOW GREAT POLITICAL THIS RISK IS THIS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE THERE IS AS YOU SAY PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR WHAT THE DOCTORS HAVE AND IT IS A HUGE RISK IN THIS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THAT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR JUNIOR DOCTORS REMAINS IN PLACE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN UPHILL STRUGGLE
TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC IT'S DOING THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME NOBODY ARGUES AGAINST SEVEN DAY WORKING BUT THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO BE HAD ABOUT WILL THE JUNIOR DOCTORS' CONTRACT REALLY HELP THAT ALL OUR OTHER THINGS FAR MORE IMPORTANT SO THE GOVERNMENT REALLY IS ENTERING VERY DANGEROUS TERRITORY AND NEED TO BE SURE OF ITS GROUND IF HE'S GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS
WITH A DEAL FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT LOSING THAT DISCRETIONARY EFFORT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS GIVE EVERY DAY GOING BEYOND THEIR CONTRACTED WORKING HOURS TO PROVIDE GREAT CARE WHAT YOU MEAN THERE'S A DANGER THE DOCTORS WILL BE SO HACKED OFF AND DEMORALISED THAT THEY WON'T DO THAT EXTRA BIT THAT REALLY IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU WERE IN SUCH A CARING PROFESSION MOST JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE ALREADY HACKED OFF AND DEMORALISED THIS HAS BECOME A DISPUTES NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE CONTRACT THAT IS IMPORTANT
ABOUT HOW JUNIOR DOCTORS FEEL VALUED OR UNDERVALUES NOT APPRECIATED WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT MOVED AGAIN I THINK HE'S THE LATEST OFFER WAS ON TUESDAY EVENING WHERE THEY WERE SUGGESTING THAT DOCTORS WHO WORKED ONE IN FOUR SATURDAYS COULD GET HER AN ENHANCED SATURDAY RATE
THEY THAT FAR APART NOW THE TWO SIDES MY VIEW IS THERE NOT THAT FAR APART AND THAT'S WHY THIS DISPUTE IS NOT IN MY VIEW PRIMARILY ABOUT THE DETAIL OF THE OFFER AND THE GROUND BETWEEN THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT IT'S ABOUT WHAT THIS IS SAYING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TO JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THE WAY THEY HAVE INTERPRETED THAT AND THEY ARE FEELING UNDERVALUED IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE N.H.S. SO HERE USE IT KNOWING BOTH SIDES WHO MOVES
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP TO BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IT'S BONKERS THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WELL YOU CAN ONLY REACH AGREEMENT IF YOU WANT TO REACH AGREEMENT I THINK AT THE MOMENT BOTH THE B.M.A. NEGOTIATORS AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PREFER TO CARRY ON IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER IT WILL TAKE SOMETHING REMARKABLE TO OVERCOME THAT THEY'VE TRIED BRINGING DAVID DALTON AS RESPECTED THIRD PARTY
WHOSE VIEWS EXPERIENCE A VERY MUCH VALUED BY THE JUNIOR DOCTORS AND THE GOVERNMENT AND EVEN HIS HERCULEAN EFFORTS HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED SO FAR SO SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO GIVE PROFESSOR CHRIS HAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT PHONES IN WHICH THE INFORMATION IS ENCRYPTED OR ENCODED ARE GOOD FOR A SECURITY BECAUSE THEY PROTECT US FROM CRIMINALS AND HACKERS THAT'S ONE VIEW THEY MIGHT STILL BE BAD BECAUSE THE POLICE CAN'T GET INTO THE SAME PHONES WHEN CRIMINALS USE THEM WHAT OF ALL THE OTHER DEVICES
CHRIS IN HE CONNECTED UP TO THE INTERNET THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES CENTRAL TO THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL WHICH OVERHAULS IT WAS INTENDED TO OVERHAUL THE WAY IN WHICH THE STATE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT US A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE IS TODAY GIVING ITS VERDICT ON THE BILL AND IN THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF REPORTS A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON KORENNA LOOKS AT THE CHALLENGE OF ENCRYPTION
THAT IS INSTALLED AS A REPLACEMENT SO THE ORIGINAL START AND IT'S CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET WE CONTROL IT DIRECTLY THROUGH THERE
FRIDGES BRANCH OF CURRYS P.C. WORLD IS FILLED WITH DEVICES FROM PHONES TO THERMOSTATS THAT CAN ALL BE CONNECTED UP OVER THE INTERNET AS A COMPANY WHO PRODUCED DOOR LOCKS WHICH A GANG CAN BE OPENED AND CLOSED DIRECTLY THROUGH HER PHONE THE PEOPLE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE KIND OF DATA THAT'S PRODUCING ALL THE SECURITY OF
ANJLI PEOPLE CAN PICKLE WHAT DATA IS IN THERE AND HOW IT'S BEING USED
SO HOW SECURE DO YOU WANT A DATA ONE ANSWER IS ENCRYPTION THAT CAN MAKE DATA UNREADABLE TO ANYONE BUT THE USER BUT THAT CAN ALSO MEAN POTENTIALLY UNREADABLE TO GOVERNMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S MINE
PHONE YES WELL KNOWN MAKE AN APPLE I PHONE THERE'S A PHONE LIKE THAT POSE CHALLENGES
ANY FOAM ON WHICH OR ANY DEVICE ON WHICH THERE IS ANY FORM OF ENCRYPTION
POSES A CHALLENGE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OF COURSE IT DOES CHRIS FARRELL AND HIS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AT THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE BENEFITS OF ENCRYPTION WHEN USED TO SECURE A PHONE AGAINST THIEVES OR HACKERS
BUT SEES PROBLEMS WHEN THE SAME ENCRYPTION IS USED BY CRIMINALS HAS IT GOT HARDER RECENTLY BURNED TO GET HOLD OF ME
BECAUSE IT'S ENCRYPTED THE ANSWER IS YES WE ARE SEEING IT ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS THE CRIMINALS WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO PROACTIVELY MAKE USE OF ENCRYPTION TO MAKE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEIR MOST THOSE WHO JUST MAKE USE OF WHAT'S BEING PROVIDED AS A BLANKET SERVICE SO HOW DOES THE INVESTIGATE THREE POWERS BILL AIM TO DEAL WITH THE ENCRYPTION CONUNDRUM
COMPANIES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS OVER THE AMBIGUITY IN ONE SECTION OF THE DRAFT BILL ABOUT WHAT POWERS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE GIVEN AND WHETHER IT COULD MEAN RESTRICTING CERTAIN TYPES OF ENCRYPTION
ERIC KING FROM THE CAMPAIGN GROUP DON'T SPY ON US WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS BUT APPLE IN PARTICULAR HAVE RAISED A REALLY BIG FUSS ABOUT IT AND IT SEEMS THAT IN THEIR EVIDENCE THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS POWER MIGHT BE
TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE APPLE TO COMPLETELY RE ARCHITECT AND CHANGE HOW THEY'VE BUILT THEIR SERVICE
TO ACCOMMODATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN THE BUILD THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM EQUIPMENT INTERFERENCE EQUIPMENT INTERFERENCE PROVISIONS IN THE BUILD WORRY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ESPECIALLY THE IDEA THE STATE COULD EITHER PLACE VULNERABILITIES AND EQUIPMENT OR COMPEL THE COMPANIES TO INSERT THEM THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE ACCESS
THAT COMPANIES FEAR COULD REDUCE CUSTOMER TRUST AND INTRODUCE NEW RISKS ANTHONY WALKER IS THE DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TECH U.K. AN INDUSTRY BODY
BUILT THE MOMENT THERE IS THE POWER TO COMPEL COMPANIES TO HACK THEIR OWN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND PUT VULNERABILITIES IN THAT THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT IS IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF PUTTING THAT VULNERABILITY IN THERE COULD BE WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEBODY ELSE DISCOVERS THAT VULNERABILITY AND EXPLOITS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD UNDERSTAND WHY IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO PUT HER VULNERABILITY INTO A SMART METER THAT IS IN IN THOUSANDS OF HOMES BUT BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT COULD MEAN THAT IF THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THEN
IT COULD ENABLE SOMEBODY TO DISCONNECT THOUSANDS OF HOMES FROM THE ELECTRICITY GRID AT THE FLICK OF A SWITCH BACK AT CURRYS DAYS A GLIMPSE OF A CONNECTED FUTURE START TO LOOK AT FRIDGES THAT THAT'S MORE TELL THEM PEOPLE WHEN CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE SHOP THERE NEED TO BE BOUGHT SO YOUR FRIDGE IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO SEND YOUR MESSAGE THAT YOU OUT OF MY OFFICE
HACKING INTO YOUR FRIDGE TO FIND OUT YOUR MILK ORDER MAY NOT PROVE TO BE A TOP PRIORITY FOR POLICE BUT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS ALREADY RAISING COMPLEX ISSUES ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY WE REALLY WANT
GORDON KARA REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO NINE NOW J.K. ROWLING HAS WRITTEN ANOTHER HARRY POTTER BOOK AT IT THAT'S NOT TRUE REALLY SHE'S WRITTEN A PLAY
HARRY POTTER CURSED STONE AND THEY'RE CALLING IT A BOOK A SCRIPT BOOK TO BE STRICTLY ACCURATE IT WILL BE PUBLISHED THE DAY AFTER THE PLAY OPENS AND IT MAKE A FORTUNE OBVIOUSLY WITH EVERYTHING SHE WRITES MAKES A FORTUNE BUT ISN'T THIS MILKING IT JUST A WEE BIT WELL LET'S DISCUSS THAT WITH JAMES DAUNTED AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WATERSTONE'S SELLS THE BOOK OR TWO IN THERE TIME AND RON EAGERLY JOURNALIST AND CRITIC AT THE ARTS DESK DOTCOM SHOTS WRITES FOR THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY VERONICA
I MEAN IT'S A BIT NAUGHTY ISN'T IT SAY HERE IS A BOOK THAT YOU CAN GO OUT AND BUY
THAT'S NOT A BOOK IT'S A PLAY IT IS A PLAY YES I DO I DON'T BE TOO CYNICAL TO EARLY IN THE MORN I'LL GO TO ME THIS THIS REPRESENTS A VERY GOOD REVENUE STREAM FOR THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE ANYBODY GOING TO THE PLAY WILL
POSSIBLY WANT TO BUY THE SCRIPT WHICH IS ALREADY GOING TO EVEN BEFORE IT'S LAUNCHED IN TWO FORMATS ALREADY TO FORM AND POSSIBLY THE FIRST ONE THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE IS THE REHEARSAL SCRIPT
AND THEN HE'S GOING TO RELEASE THE FINAL THE DIRECTOR'S CUT AS IT WERE THAT PEOPLE LIKE ME WILL BE SEEING IS EVEN WORSE THAN I THOUGHT SO HOW MANY MORE VERSIONS THERE ARE GOING TO BE A DISCREET TERM IS YOUR GUESS AT THE SECOND SCRIPT THERE ONE OF THE BEACH BUT I DON'T KNOW ON AND ON AND ON AND ON OR JAMES WHAT ARE WE WHAT WHAT ARE WE MEANT TO MAKE OF THIS
WILL YOU GET THE CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT I THINK MYSELF I NIPPED THE PROSPECT OF AN EIGHTH VOLUME EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITING BUT ALSO IT'S REALLY DO YOU CHALLENGE THE NOTION THAT PLAYS AREN'T WONDERFUL THINGS TO READ AN EXTRAORDINARY THINGS TO READ AND WHO WAS THAT BLOKE SHAKESPEARE HAD A FEW THAT WERE WORTH IT AND INDEED MANY OF OUR MODERN PLAYWRIGHTS I DISTRUST A SHAKESPEARE MAYBE HE DID PUBLISH IN THEM AS A BOAR COMING SLIGHTLY IN THERE WAS NO DAWN WATERS OF THE SOUTHERN THEN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN WE CAN WE CONTINUE TO SELL THE COD PLENTY OF THOSE
AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEATRE IS A VERY LOCAL FOR NON WERE OBVIOUSLY ACTUALLY PLAY SCRIPTS DO YOU SELL EXTREMELY WELL THEY JUST STOOD IN THE IMMEDIATE LOCALITY OF THE THEATRE WHERE THE PLAYERS GOING ON
AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL ENTERTAINMENT MORE PEOPLE SHOULD DO IT RIGHT SO IF I WENT TO YOURS DON'T I'VE NEVER TRIED THIS AND SAID OBVIOUSLY I KNOW I CAN BUY HAMLET OR SOMETHING IN BOOK FORM BUT OTHER LOTS AND LOTS OF PLAYS OUT THERE THAT I COULD BUY IN BOOK FORM YES AND YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT FORM OF READING EXPERIENCE AS INDY POETRY GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE BUT A PLAY A SHORT PIECE YOU CAN READ IT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
I THINK YOU READ DIFFERENTLY IN A SLOWER AWAY OR AT LEAST I DO IT'S A MUCH MORE SUDDEN NOISY THING WITHIN YOUR HEAD BUT IT'S ENORMOUSLY REWARDING BUT IT WAS WRITTEN TO BE PERFORMED FOR THE OBVIOUS BUT THAT THAT WAS THE POINT OF IT
WELL I DUNNO YOU GO AND PICK YOURSELF UP A HAROLD PINTER OR A DAVID HOW WELL I CAN PROMISE YOU WILL NOT THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE ENJOYED I DIDN'T SAY CAN ONLY BE ENJOYED BUT BUT I TAKE YOUR POT WHAT WAS A BIT VERONICA WHAT DO YOU THINK I SLIGHTLY AGREE WITH JAMES THAT THAT THAT IS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE BUT MOST THEATRE GOES EVEN THE KEENEST THEATREGOERS NEVER EVER READ A PLAY SCRIPT
I KNOW I MOST OF MY READING A PLAY SCRIPT TENDS TO BE FOR WORK I WOULD BE BUT JAMES READ SHAKESPEARE IN SCRIPT FORM AND BECAUSE IT'S JUST SIMPLY MARVELLOUS BUT NOT EVERY PLATE IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
MAKING PLAYS IT'S WHAT GOES FROM THE PAGE TO THE STAGE AND THAT'S NOT SIMPLY THE PLAYWRIGHTS VISION IT'S THE DIRECTOR'S VISION IT'S WHAT THE ACTORS BRING TO IT WAS WHAT THE STAGE DESIGNER BRINGS TO IT OR NOT ARE YOU DID YOU DO YOU REALISE WHAT A CRAFT THERE IS
IN TAKING FROM PAGE TO STAGE THAT IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN THIS IS NO WAY TO DENIGRATE ANY WRITERS BUT IT'S THERE IS SO MUCH TO BRINGING ANNIE PLAY TO LIFE AND IF WE JUST MAKE THE POINT THAT
IT MAY WELL BECAUSE CHILDREN WILL READ IT OF COURSE COS IT'S NOT THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS AND THEREFORE THEY WERE READING IT MAY INTRODUCE THEM TO THE THEATRE THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN AND WE COULD SET UP ANOTHER GENERATION OF READING MORE JUST JUDGE J.K. ROWLING TO GIVE HER HER DUE IS LIZ PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CHILDREN TO STARTING TO READ AND TO READ BIG BOOKS AND NOT TO BE DAUNTED BY THEM AND THEY'RE HIS BELIEF THAT SHE INTRODUCED BUT WAYS AT THAT VERY DIFFICULT AGE WHERE THEY
PERHAPS A SLOWER TO READ THAN GIRL SO THERE IS A GENERATION THAT WE SHOULD THANK HER FOR THAT DO YOU READ AND RE KEENLY AND SHE CAN GET
YOUNGSTERS INTO READING PLAYS AND THEY'RE PERHAPS GOING TO SEE MORE PLAYS MORE POWER TO HER ROB AND JAMES YOU DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE THE CASE THAT BECAUSE AS VERONICA WAS SAYING TINY NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO GO UP GO ON BUYER SCRIPT AND READ SCRIPT THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE PLAY DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS MUCH SHOULD BE BLAZING A NEW NOT A NEW TRAIL AS YOU'VE SAID BUT NONETHELESS
I THINK CERTAINLY CLEARLY THIS ONE IS LIKELY TO BE HUGELY ENJOYABLE AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL STAB PRISING THE SECTIONS AND IT REPRESENTS ONE PER CENT OF OUR FICTION SELLS AT THE MOMENT IN THAT DOESN'T DO JUSTICE TO THE CALIBRE OF THE BOOKS WITH IT WHEN YOU SAY IT REPRESENTS DROP BACK TO HER RIGHT WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM BY THE WAY BECAUSE THIS IDEA OF A SCRIPT A BOOKIES
WELL THEM SO WE CALL THEM CLAY'S IN RENT AT THAT OATH WHAT ONE PER CENT OF YOUR SALES ARE PLAYS AND THEIR NAME I THINK WHERE'S THAT ONE PER CENT OF OUR FICTION SALES ARE WE INCLUDE IT WITHIN THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF FICTION RIGHT BUT NONETHELESS VERONICA THAT THAT'S STILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER I THINK THAT NUMBER ALSO INCLUDES OTHER OTHER BOOKS
AT THE THEATRE AND THINKING I COULD BE WRONG WITH IT DON'T WORK I THINK IF YOU TOOK AWAY GHQ TAX THEN IT DROPS DOESN'T IT ANYWAY THE ONE THING WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN ABOUT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SEE THE PLAY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL READ THE BOOKS THERE WE GO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED THAT VERONICA LEE AND JAMES BOTH OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE ANDREW BRYSON AND TOM CALLS IN OUR TIME IS UP NEXT FROM US ALL GOOD MORNING
