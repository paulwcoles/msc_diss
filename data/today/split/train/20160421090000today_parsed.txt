ON DEFENCE IS APPARENTLY ONLY BEING MET THROUGH WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING THE DEFENCE COMMITTEE SAYS WELL NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SEVERAL MAJOR EXPENDITURES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED ELSEWHERE SUCH AS INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND WAR PENSIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTS LABOUR HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF FIDDLING THE BOOKS BUT THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE INSISTS IT'S ACCOUNTS COMPLY WITH NATO'S GUIDELINES

FIGURES SHOW THAT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION POUNDS WAS LOST IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR TO FRAUDSTERS WHO TRICKED THEIR VICTIMS INTO MAKING A PAYMENT INTO THE WRONG BANK ACCOUNT THE STATISTICS PROVIDED BY POLICE TO RADIO FOUR'S YOU WHEN YOURS PROGRAMME SHOW THE NUMBER OF SUCH FRAUDS HAVE INCREASED BY SEVENTY PERCENT IN A YEAR IS A PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT SIMON GUMPERT
MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE REPORTED BEING SCANNED LAST YEAR IN FRAUDS WHICH EXPLOIT OUR CONFIDENCE AT AN EMAIL REALLY HAS BEEN SENT BY SOMEONE WE HAVE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH TYPICALLY THE MESSAGES LOOK LEGITIMATE BUT ARE ACTUALLY FROM A HACKER WHO GETS INTO HER BUSINESSES EMAIL SYSTEM WORKS OUT WHAT BILLS ARE DUE AND SENDS OUT FAKE INVOICES DEMANDING PAYMENT TO A FRAUDULENT BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER
ONE WOMAN WHO'D ORDERED A WOOD BURNING STOVE WAS BUILT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT EXACTLY THE TIME SHE EXPECTED BUT PAID THE MONEY TO A CON MERCHANT

THE GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT IT'S CALLED A SERIOUS ERROR AND HAS BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION BUT ABOUT HALF A MILLION TEST PAPERS ARE ALREADY WITH SCHOOLS ACROSS ENGLAND IN SEALED ENVELOPES AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THERE'S TIME TO RE WRITE THEM
OLIVER FARRELL ON THERE THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES PAST SIX THOMAS SHAFFER KNACKERS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING TOM END OF SUMMER YET END OF SUMMER SHE STARRED OF TASTE OF WINTER PERHAPS AGAIN THIS THIS WEEKEND SO SOME COLDER WINDS ON THE WAY EVEN ONE OR TWO WINTRY SHOWERS BUT NOT TODAY TODAY IS ACTUALLY NOT LOOKING TOO BAD FOR MOST OF US YESTERDAY ANOTHER STUNNING DAY TODAY I THINK THE SCAN THE SKIES WILL TURN A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOUDY
THERE'S ACTUALLY A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND RIGHT NOW THOSE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MORNING BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE ANY MORE THAN WHAT IT IS ALREADY JUST A FEW SPOTS FOR MOST OF US IT'S A BRIGHT START THERE'S A TOUCH OF FROST AROUND ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY IN FACT OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT ABOUT TWO OR THREE DEGREES BELOW FREEZING ACROSS PARTS OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND ENGLAND
THEN LATER ON TODAY ACTUALLY IT'S GOING TO WARM UP QUITE NICELY BEST TEMPERATURES COULD PEAK AT AROUND EIGHTEEN DEGREES AND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE GET THAT IN PLACES LIKE SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND COULD WARM UP QUITE NICELY TO THESE AREAS WILL BE THE SUNNIEST SO NORTHERN ENGLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND ENJOYING A FINE DAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE
THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY LET'S SAY FROM THE MIDLANDS AND ALSO WALES EVERYWHERE SOUTHWARDS HERE I THINK THICKER CLOUD TODAY IT WILL BE A LITTLE BIT COOLER AROUND ABOUT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DEGREES AND TOMORROW EXPECT SOME RAIN IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY IT SHOULD REACH US PROBABLY FROM ROUND ABOUT THE EARLY HOURS AND THEN AS I SAID IT'S A COLD A THEME FOR THE FOR THE WEEKEND WE COULD SEE SOME HAIL SHOWERS EVEN FOR THE LONDON MARATHON RUNNER SO A CHANGE ON THE WAY
THANKS THOMAS SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX HAVE A LOOK AT THAT THE PAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGES DOMINATED BY PICTURES OF THE QUEEN AS YOU'D EXPECT A NINETIETH BIRTHDAY AND IN PARTICULAR DAILY TELEGRAPH GOING TO TOWN HUGE PHOTOGRAPH CROSS ITS FRONT PAGE BUT PICTURES TOO
VICTORIA WOOD WHO DIED YESTERDAY OF CANCER AT THE AGE OF JUST SIXTY TWO AND SOME LOVELY PHOTOS OF HER ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN
AND IT'S THE LEAD STORY IN THE DAILY MAIL SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD COMEDIAN DIED AT HER HOME SURROUNDED BY HER FAMILY SHE HAD HIDDEN HER ILLNESS THE MAIL SAYS EVEN FROM HER CLOSEST FRIENDS AND THEY QUOTE JULIE WALTERS ON THE FRONT PAGE WHO ELSE THE LOSS OF HER IS INCALCULABLE
THE TIMES HAS A LEAD A BOAT OFFSHORE COMPANIES IT SAYS THE OWNERS OF OFFSHORE COMPANIES HOLDING ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS IN BRITISH PROPERTY
I'M GOING TO BE UNMASKED IN A CRACKDOWN ON MONEY LAUNDERING AND TAX EVASION DAVID CAMERON'S EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE PLAN WAS TO LIFT THE VEIL ON ANONYMOUS SHELL COMPANIES THAT BUY HUGE SWATHES OF BRITISH REAL ESTATE WHILE OWNING PROPERTY WERE OFFSHORE COMPANIES IS NOT ILLEGAL SO IS THE TIMES IT DOES ALLOW CRIMINALS TO MASK OWNERSHIP AND HIDE IT TAXABLE ASSETS BECAUSE ONLY THE COMPANY'S NAME APPEARS ON PUBLIC DOCUMENTS
THE TIMES SAYS A WOMAN WHO PERSUADED HER
PARENTS TO GIVE TWO ON A FIFTY THOUSAND TO FUND A DOCTORATE AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY ACTUALLY SPENT THEIR MONEY ON DRUGS HOLIDAYS IN A LAVISH WEDDING TO WHICH THEY WERE NOT INVITED AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY THAT SHE TOLD HER PARENTS THAT SHE NEEDED THE MONEY FOR A RESEARCH PROJECT
TOWARDS A P.H.D. IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AT OXFORD SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING ON LONG TRIPS TO MONGOLIA AND GRACE HER PARENTS GAVE UP THEIR JOBS SO THE HOUSE BELIEVING THAT SHE WOULD MAKE EVENTUALLY THREE MILLION POUNDS FROM HER ACADEMIC WORK AND SHE IS NOW OMITTED FRAUD AT TRURO CROWN COURT YESTERDAY AND WAS JAILED
THE TELEGRAPH HAS A LITTLE STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE ABOUT THE MONA LISA APPARENTLY THE MONA LISA WAS BASED NOT JUST ON A FLORENTINE MERCHANT'S WIFE AS WE HAD THOUGHT BUT ALSO ON LEONARDO DA VINCI HIS APPRENTICE AND PROBABLE GAY LOVER AND ITALIAN
ART DETECTIVE CLAIMS ALL THIS VARNA WIND CHECK T. SAYS THE PORTRAIT WAS AN AMALGAM OF LISA GET HER DEENY THE WIFE OF A WEALTHY MERCHANT AND JAN CUP ROARTY HE'S GAY LOVER WHO DO
THE TIME TEN PAST SIX THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP MONEY LAUNDERING OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS DANNY SURE WHAT TURNED DOWN IT WILL HELP TELL US HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT IS FIRST WELL ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SAYS THAT BRITAIN'S WORLD LEADING FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS AT RISK OF BEING UNDERMINED BY MONEY LAUNDERING ILLICIT FINANCE IN THE FUNDING OR TERRORISM AND THAT'S WHY TODAY SHE IS LAUNCHING AN ACTION PLAN TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT THIS IS THE BIGGEST SHAKE UP
FOR A DECADE BUT IN THIS THIS SECTOR AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ALREADY SET UP A JOINT MONEY LAUNDERING INTELLIGENCE TASKFORCE I THINK WE REPORTED ON THAT BEFORE INCLUDES ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND BANKS AND NOW THEY ARE GOING TO
PROPOSED A NEW LEGISLATION WHICH HE'LL CONSULT ON FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS INCLUDING AN ILLICIT ENRICHMENT OFFENCE NOW THIS MEANS THAT IT WOULD BE A CRIME FOR A PUBLIC OFFICIAL ALSO THAT COULD BE AN M. P. LOCAL COUNCILLOR CIVIL SERVANT POLICE OFFICER
WHO IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THEIR ASSETS EXACTLY HOW THAT WILL WORK WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THE CONSULTATION BUT THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NEW MEASURE BUT PRESUMABLY IF YOU'VE GOT TO KILL OFF MONEY LAUNDERING EVERYBODY'S GOT TO DO IT BECAUSE IF THERE ARE ANY OUTLETS AS IT WERE THEN THE MONEY LAUNDERERS WILL GET AWAY WITH IT
WHAT INDEED AND THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR EXAMPLE UNEXPLAINED WEALTH ORDERS THESE ARE MEASURES AIMED AT ANYONE WHO IS SUSPECTED OF MONEY LAUNDERING WHO CAN'T EXPLAIN WHERE THEIR MONEY HAS COME FROM THE COURTS CIVIL COURTS WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO ORDER THEM TO DECLARE THEIR WEALTH
IF THE ANSWERS THEY PROVIDE UNSATISFACTORY THEN THERE WILL BE A FORFEITURE POWER AND OBVIOUSLY THEY COULD LOSE THAT MONEY SO THE ILLICIT IN RICHMOND OFFENCES REALLY AIMED AT PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO STOP CORRUPTION YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLE PERHAPS HAVE A COUNSELLOR WHO DOES SOME KIND OF DEAL WITH A PROPERTY DEVELOPER IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FOR THE PROPERTY DEVELOPER TO SECURE RIGHTS OVER DEVELOPING LANDING IN THE AREA
CAN'T QUITE EXPLAIN HOW THAT MONEY GETS THERE THAT WOULD BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE EXACTLY WHAT THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE I THINK WILL EMERGE IN DUE COURSE BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT NEW POWERS IN THESE A PROPOSALS FROM THERESA MAY TODAY DANNY MANY THANKS
THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX THE OLYMPIC TORCH IS LIT TODAY THE COUNTDOWN OF COURSE TO THE SUMMER'S GAMES IN BRAZIL ARE THEY READY SOME SAY NOT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE B.B.C.'S WHERE A DAVIS IS IN
YOU'VE GOT TO CARE WOULD BE MORE GAMES BRITISH BAKING OR LONDON
WE CAN PUT IT INTO TRUE MOST OF THE SPORTING VENUE
ALMOST IT'S NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED THE TRACK AND GONE PRETTY WELL
SEE YOU'RE THE LOCAL OAK I THINK IF YOU CAN A GOOD JOB THE PROBLEM IT IS A LOT OF THE
READY THERE'S A CRUCIAL METRO LINE FOR EXAMPLE
MADE OLYMPIC PARK THAT IS TOUCH AND GO WITH ONLY IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE CREATED IT MIGHT ONLY BE
OPEN WHATEVER THAT MEANS YOU'RE IN THE GAME
AT THE BAY IN RIO ONE OF OUR BAY WERE ALL THE SAILING EVENTS
BUT IS CHRONIC AND THEY SIMPLY HAVE ALMOST GIVEN UP ON TRYING TO CLEAN THE BED
SEVERAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS AROUND THE CITY DIE LOCAL OAK I THINK IT WOULD BE
THEY'RE SPENDING ON EXTRA THINGS FOR JOURNAL
IT WON'T BE ANY VIEWING AREAS SO WHILE ATHLETE MIGHT NOT SEE THE DIFFERENCE I THINK THEY HAD JUST THE GAME
SO IT WAS REPORTING ON AGAINST MIGHT FEEL A BIT MORE
WE CAN'T
AND OVERSPENDING BRAZIL IS WEDDING PAVILION PUBLIC GIVEN THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY WOULD ALLOW THEIR GOVERNMENT
GAMES WITH AN OVER SENSITIVE I'M A LOT OF THINGS AND YOU MENTIONED THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY BUT WHICH IS BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REALLY ISN'T IT LET THAT YOU DID IS THAT GOING TO OVERSHADOW IT FOR BRAZILIANS
I MEAN CAN YOU GO WHEN GRILL WAS AWARDED THAT WORLD CUP AND THE OLYMPIC GAME
YOU LOOK LIKE A FANTASTIC IDEA BUT IT WAS A BOOM
GREAT WELL THEIR PROGRESS NOW
BUT THEY'LL NEED IN OLYMPIC GAMES WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A POLITICAL
MET COMIC LIKE IF THE COUNTRY'S IN RECESSION INFLATION RATE OF OVER TEN PERCENT
PERHAPS IT WAS A NEW PRESIDENT WILL PROBABLY STILL BE IN OFFICE
DICK TORCH WHEN IT ARRIVED IN BRAZIL ON THE CREDIT MATE BUT IT
EMBARRASSING FOR HER AND GROW THAT SHE
HE SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE DURING THE GAMES THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THIS IMPEACHMENT PROCESS GOING ON NOW IS THE LAUGHING
THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS I THINK BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
THE GAMES COULD PROBABLY DIDN'T HELP
RESULT DOESN'T REALLY NEED THEM RIGHT NOW WHERE DAVIES IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
QUARTER OF A SIX AND WE HAVE A NEW FACE A NEW VOICE ON A BUSINESS A DESK IN A BUSINESS THAT'S NOT SURELY THIS MORNING LUCY BUTTON WELL NEW TO US NOT THE WORLD SERVICE OF COURSE LUCY WELCOME AND THERE'S A BIG CUT ANOTHER I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY SHAREHOLDER RUCKUS ON THE WAY THANKS FOR THE WELCOME JOHN YES THERE'S A STORY THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THE TWO BIG BUSINESS THEMES OF RECENT WEEKS AND MONTHS BULLET HAD THIRTY IN THE COMMODITIES MARKETS AND REVOLTING SHAREHOLDERS
I'LL BE LOOKING MORE AT THIS AFTERNOON'S ANGLO AMERICAN A.G.M. IN JUST A MOMENT BUT FIRST I WANT TO LOOK AT A SCANDAL YOU'LL ALREADY BE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH DODGY DIESEL EMISSIONS AND MAJOR MOTOR MANUFACTURER HAS WON AGAIN ONCE AGAIN HAD TO HOLD IT HANDS UP AND ADMIT TO FIDDLING IT'S TESTS IT'S BESSIE SAYS FUEL ECONOMY TESTS ON SOME OF ITS CARS MAKE MADE FOR THE JAPANESE MARKET WERE FALSIFIED
VOLKSWAGEN IS DUE IN COURT IN THE U.S. LATER TODAY IT'S THOUGHT THEY'RE PROMISED TO BUY BACK SOME OF THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DIESEL CARS WHICH HAD THE MISSION'S CHEATING SOFTWARE INSTALLED SOME REPORTS SUGGEST THEY COULD SPEND OVER A BILLION DOLLARS COMPENSATING OWNERS IT MOULD MOULDINESS AS THE C.O. AND FOUNDER OF OMISSIONS ANALYTICS AND A SALFORD STUDIO GOOD MORNING NICK GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THERE'S BUY BACK WILL BE ENOUGH TO GET THE AUTHORITIES OFF E. W.
POTENTIALLY IT WILL YES AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THAT IS POSSIBLY THE QUICKEST AND MOST SECURE WAY OF SORTING OUT THIS PROBLEM IN THE U.S. MARKET AND REALLY FOR VOLKSWAGEN DRAWING A LINE UNDER THIS AND MOVING ON IS CRUCIAL
YOU OF COURSE LAUNCHING A NEW VEHICLES OMISSIONS INDEX TODAY HOW'S THAT GOING
YES IT'S CALLED THE EQUE INDEX AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE REAL ON ROAD EMISSIONS OF NITROGEN OXIDE SO SO THAT THE NOXIOUS POLLUTANTS INVOLVED IN THE VOLKSWAGEN SCANDAL IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN MEASURING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE REAL ROAD AND THIS INDEX GIVES A RATING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL MODEL ON THE MARKET SO WHEN YOU'RE BUYING A DIESEL YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES ARE THE CLEAN ONES AND WHICH ONES HAVE THE DIRTY ONES
SO THIS IS SUGGESTING THAT THE CURRENT IN THE SEA IS THE CURRENT TESTS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEM I WAS SERIOUSLY I THINK THE CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY SYSTEM ISN'T IS NOW VERY LOW THOUGH BOTH ON THE NITROGEN OXIDE SIDE AND ALSO ON THE C.O.TWO FUEL ECONOMY SIDE
BETWEEN REALITY AND OFFICIAL NOW THEY'RE IMPROVING FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONWARDS BUT IN THE MEANTIME EVERYONE THINKS ALL DIESELS ARE DIRTY AND WE CAN SEE FROM OUR EQUERRY INDEX AT THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL WITH SOME NOTABLE DIESEL'S COMING OUT VERY CLEAN YES SO THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING I WAS LOOKING AT THE DATA BASE JUST BEFORE I CAME ON AND IT LOOKS LIKE OUR DIE ERSTE GOAD AARON THE V.W. GROUP HAVE SOME OF THE CLEANEST OMISSIONS NOT GIVEN THE SCANDAL IN THE U.S. WITH US A BIT OF A SURPRISE
IT WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE EVEN TO US BUT WHAT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE CARS IMPLICATED IN THE CRISIS OF THE PREVIOUS GENERATION OF ENGINES WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM THIS IS THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP HAVE THE CLEANEST CARS
IN THE MARKET PLACE TODAY OF THEIR CURRENT GENERATION SO WE'VE GIVEN SIX A RATINGS FOR CARS CURRENTLY ON SALE FOR DIESELS AND ALL SIX COME FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP AND I THINK THAT IS THAT IT WILL COME AS A SURPRISE TO MANY AND HE'S QUITE A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF INFORMATION IN THIS WHOLE EVOLVING SCANDAL THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD THEY'VE GOT NOW GOT THE CLEANEST CARS ON THE MARKET
DO YOU REALLY THINK THOUGH THAT IF YOU ARE BUYING A NEW CAR YOU'RE THAT INTERESTED IN THE MISSIONS SURELY WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT COMES DOWN TO PRICE
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE SAID THAT ABOUT C.O.TWO AND GRADUALLY A C.O.TWO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND THEN MONEY THROUGH THE TAXATION SCHEME THE VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY PEOPLE STARTED TO RATE THAT MORE IS MORE HIGHLY AND I THINK EXACTLY THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN WITH NITROGEN OXIDES PEOPLE ARE NOW VERY CONSCIOUS ABOUT URBAN AIR QUALITY AND THE HEALTH EFFECTS
AS LONDON AND OTHER CITIES POTENTIALLY INTRODUCED CLEAN AIR ZONES WHERE IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER DIESEL YOU HAVE TO PAY TO GO IN AGAIN NITROGEN OXIDES WILL START TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MONEY IN THE CONSUMER MIND AND THEREFORE THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE PROMINENT IN THE BUYING DECISION
NICK DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO BRING IN DAVID STUBBS NOW HE'S A GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN THAT'S A MANAGEMENT DAVID JUST BRIEFLY HOUSING MARKET REACTED TO THIS LATEST NEWS FROM DEVIATE FROM B. B. W. WELL I THINK THAT IT'S POSITIVITY TO MOVE PAST THE SCANNER WILL OBVIOUSLY
WHAT INVESTORS FEARED IS FRANKLY THAT THESE WERE JUST THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GET CAUGHT ELVES AND OBVIOUSLY THE NEWS WITH YOU SEEM TODAY THAT THAT OTHER MANUFACTURERS POTENTIALLY HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES THIS IS A NIGHTMARE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR BECAUSE AS DIS HITS YOU FROM THE BLUES THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE YOU COULD HAVE NO MUD THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THE RESEARCH ON THIS IS NO THEN IT BEFORE THAT'S WHY IT'S ALWAYS RISKY TO CONCENTRATE INVESTMENTS IF YOUR COMPANY'S DIVERSIFICATION AGAIN IT'S A KEY TO CONTROLLING THE SWEAT
IF WE MOVE ON NOW TO THE ANGLO AMERICAN A.G.M. WHICH IS GOING TO BE HELD IN LONDON LATER I LIKE OTHER MINING BUSINESSES IT'S BEEN SUFFERING OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTH SAYS BILL BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE LAST YEAR THANKS TO THE COMMODITIES ARE OUT AND THE COMPANY WAS FORCED TO ANNOUNCE A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING SEEMS REMINISCENT FROM THE B.P.A. G.M. THIS LED TO CALLS FROM SEVERAL INVESTOR AND PIES REGROUPS THE SHAREHOLDERS' VOTE AGAINST EXECUTIVE PACKAGES
THE C.O. RECEIVED THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PAY PACKET LAST YEAR SO DAVID IS THAT A FAIR PAY PACKET BECAUSE OF COURSE SOME MIGHT ARGUE THAT ANGLOS PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY ANGLO ARE THE RESULT OF WHEAT COMMODITY PRICES IN THE COMPLEX POLITICS OF SOUTH AFRICA IT'S BASED RATHER THAN MISMANAGEMENT SURE I THINK THIS IS A COMPOSITION WHEN IT CUTS ACROSS ALL OF THE SOCIAL TRENDS AND TENSIONS WERE SEEING ACROSS FOR THE POLITICAL PROCESS IS WHEN IT'S TO TALK ABOUT
WORRIES ABOUT INEQUALITY WARDS IT WORRIES ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN C.O. PAY AND REGULAR WORKER PAY SO EXCEPT OF COURSE THIS IS A COMPANY THAT'S BEEN HAMMERED BY THE PRICES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE DAY OF THIS COMPANY AND OTHERS YOU A HUGE AMOUNT OF ESSEN WAS TAKEN ON JUST AT THE WRONG TIME AND THAT HAS TO BE AT SOME POINT YOU DOUBT HER DOWN TO MANAGEMENT AND IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY YOU THEIR PATIENT BE AFFECTED BY THE PERFORMANCE
DO YOU THINK SHAREHOLDERS ARE JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE RETURNS OR IS THERE SOMETHING BIGGER HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT A SORT OF TREND TO CONCERN ABOUT THE WIDENING GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR I THINK INCREASINGLY A PEOPLE'S FOCUS INCREASINGLY SEEN AS WAY AS PART OF THE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO TOO PRETTY TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HOW THINGS LOOK TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE GAP THERE BETWEEN REGULAR REGULAR PAY N.C.O. PAY WHICH OF COURSE IS MUCH BIGGER HERE THAN SOMEONE LIKE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THAT GAP REMAINS ACTUALLY NOWHERE NEAR THE SIZE OF THE WESTERN ECONOMIES NOW THE OTHER BIG STORY DOING AROUND US ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE F.T. THIS MORNING IS THE E. USE STEPPING UP ITS BATTLE WITH GOOGLE THE LATEST IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST U.S. TECH COMPANIES
THE ANTI TRUST COMMISSION SAYS GOOGLE'S BEEN ABUSING THE DOMINANCE OF HIS ANDROID SMARTPHONE SYSTEM AND HERE'S THE EUROPEAN COMPETITION CAN MINISTER MARGARET INVESTED HER EXPLAINING HER OBJECTIONS WHAT WE FOUND IS A GOOGLE PURSUE AN OVERALL STRATEGY
ON MOBILE DEVICES TO PROTECT AND EXPAND ITS DOMINANT POSITION IN INTERNET SEARCH IT IS DOING SO BY IMPOSING UNJUSTIFIED RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS AREN'T MANUFACTURERS OF DEVICES WAS RUNNING AND WRITE THE MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM
AS WELL AS MORE QUIET NETWORK OPERATORS
SO DAVID THE BIG QUESTIONS SHOULD GOOGLE BE RUNNING SCARED NOW BRUSSELS AS COMING AFTER THEM BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES LIKE BRUSSELS DOES LIKE LOVE TO GO AFTER LARGE COMPANIES WHERE IT CAN CLAIM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY THAT THERE IS A MARKET MANIPULATION GOING ON I DON'T THINK ANYONE SURPRISED ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN RUMBLING AROUND FOR FOR A WHILE AND I THINK HAS TO BE A CONCERN TO GET TO GOOGLE INVESTS A GOOGLE ITSELF IT IS
IN EFFECT AN ADVERTISING COMPANY ITS SEARCH PATTERNS AND TRENDS DRIVE PEOPLE PAST THOSE ADVERTS AND EFFECTS THE VALUE AND OF COURSE PART OF THE STRATEGY OF MAKING ANDROID FREE AND MAKING ANDROID YOU SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE HOUND THEY HAND HOLD THE ECOSYSTEM WAS TO SUPPORT THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY SO I THINK I THINK THIS WAS NOT THE LAST WE CAN HEAR THIS DAVID STUBBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW FINALLY WE KNOW THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY RELIES ON THE SERVICE SECTOR MORE THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE
IT CONTRIBUTES AROUND SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF G.D.P. AND IN YOUR REPORT FROM BARCLAYS SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE ANY TIME SOON THEY BELIEVE THAT IN TEN YEARS' TIME SERVICES ON ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF U.K. EXPORTS HITTING PARITY WITH GOODS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WAITING VERY PATIENTLY HERE IN THE STUDIO IS A THAT TUCK HEAD OF GLOBAL TRANSACTION THANKING ABOUT PLEASE MATT TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FORECAST WHAT HAVE YOU WORKED OUT AND HAVE YOU DONE IT
YES I MEAN THIS IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE EXPORTING IS GREAT WEEK THIS WEEK AND THE IS TRADE INDEX LOOKS AT THE MACRO OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.K. EXPORTERS FROM S.M.E.S ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO MULTINATIONALS AROUND THE GLOBE WHAT IT'S TELLING US AS YOU LAID OUT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE OVERALL MIX FROM ABOUT FORTY THREE PERCENT TODAY OF SERVICES FOR EXPORTS RISING TO FIFTY PER CENT HOWEVER IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT WE'RE ALSO FORECASTING IN THE REPORT
AN INCREASE OF TWO EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE BILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX UP FROM FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX BILLION OVER ALSO EXPECTING TO SEE A RISE NOT JUST IN SERVICES BUT ALSO THINK IT'S COS THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION THERE IS THIS IDEA ISN'T THAT DEBT DO YOU CARE GONE HE'S BECOME QUITE RELIANT ON SERVICES
MANUFACTURING BASES DISAPPEARING SO IS THAT NOT THE CASE I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE AT ALL AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE REPORT WE DO FORECAST A REAL GROWTH IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY INSURANCE PENSIONS EDUCATION BUT ALSO FORECASTING GROWTH IN THERE IN THE GOOD SECTOR AS WELL WHICH IS ENCOURAGING I THINK THE OTHER THING TO BEAR IN MIND HERE IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR U.K. EXPORTERS THOSE X. FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES A GLOBAL IN NATURE
NOW YOU'VE PUBLISHED THIS REPORT IN A WEEK WHEN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE HAS FOCUSED PARTICULARLY ON TRADE WHO CAN WE EXPECT THE U.K.'S DOMINANT TRADING PARTNERS TO BE AND WHY WELL CURRENTLY THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE U.S. IS STILL OUR BIGGEST EXPORT MARKET AND WE WE FORECAST THAT WILL CONTINUE WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING THOUGH IS THE RISE OF THE EMERGING MARKETS IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT WAS HER SIXTEENTH LARGEST EXPORT MARKET AND BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX WE FORECAST THAT TO BE TO BE NUMBER SIX
IN TERMS OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES INDIA INDONESIA VIETNAM THE EMERGING MARKETS ARE GOING TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE ALTHOUGH THE U.S. AND THE E.U. WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS FOR THE U.K. JUST VERY BRIEFLY IMMENSE AND CHINA HE WORRIED ABOUT SO ANGRY GROWTH THIS CLEARLY SLOWING GROWTH IN CHINA AND THAT'S REPRESENTED ACTUALLY IN THE OVERALL GROWTH FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SLOWING SLIGHTLY SO WE'RE FORECASTING A GROWTH OF ABOUT FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS VERSES FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT FOR THE PREVIOUS TEN THERE CLEARLY CHINA IS STILL GROWING AND THE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES THERE FOR THE U.K. EXPORT MARKET

IN ENGLAND IN THE AUTUMN SPENDING REVIEW AND THE KEY POINT IS THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY THE END OF THE DECADE THE SHARE THAT GENERAL PRACTICE GETS IN THEN H. S. ENGLAND'S BUDGET WILL RISE TO JUST OVER TEN PER CENT POSSIBLY AS HIGH AS ELEVEN PERCENT
AND THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO PATIENTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE AWARE OF HOW IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO GET A G.P. APPOINTMENT DOCTORS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING THAT THEY'VE BEEN OVER BURDENED AND THEY FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN LISTENED TO WITH THIS RESCUE PACKAGE
BUT HOW DOES THE MONEY SO I'M GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF NEW DE PEAS IS IT WELL THERE ARE PLANS AND THESE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED PREVIOUSLY TO RECRUIT FIVE THOUSAND EXTRA G.P.S IN ENGLAND BY THE END OF THIS DECADE
THAT IS GOING TO BE A STRETCH EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE'S GOING TO BE QUITE TOUGH BECAUSE THAT IS DOUBLE THE RATES THAT WE'VE HAD IN PREVIOUS TAKES AN AWFULLY LONG TIME DID TO CREATIVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD A G.P. DOESN'T IT THE TRAINING TAKES AN AWFULLY LONG TIME
THAT'S RIGHT YES IT'S QUITE SOME YEARS AND THERE WAS THIS WILL BE FOCUSING OR STEPPING UP EFFORTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO TRY AND GET MORE TRAINEES TO GO INTO GENERAL PRACTICE BUT ALSO THESE PLANS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT LEAST TEN PER CENT OF THE DOCTORS AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NEW DOCTORS WILL NEED TO BE RECRUITED FROM OVERSEAS THERE'S GOING TO BE WHAT'S CALLED A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT CAMPAIGN SO ISLAMIC KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THEY THEY WON'T GET TOOL OF THAT FIVE THOUSAND BY HOME GROWN G.P.S ALONE
A WHOLE RECEIVES IS THAT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE I MEAN WE HAVE SEEN HAS SOMETHING OF AN OUTFLOW OF DOCTORS VOTING WITH THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA BUT THERE MAY WELL BE SOME DEMAND AND THE NETHERLANDS HAS BEING TALKED ABOUT AS ONE POSSIBLE SOURCE OF CHEAP G.P.S INDIA HAS BEEN A VERY RICH SOURCE OF RECRUITMENT FOR HEALTH CARE STAFF THAT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT AS WELL
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BUT IT'S NOT JUST EXTRA G.P.S WHO ARE BEING RECRUITED THAT WILL BE NURSES CLINICAL PHARMACIST AND MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS GOING INTO SURGERIES AS WELL AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE DEMAND FOR GENERAL PRACTICE CANNOT BE MET JUST BY DOCTORS ALONE AND THAT OTHER SORTS OF STAFF I NEEDED TO TO HELP A SECTOR THAT HAS REALLY THIS IS A BLUNT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TODAY HAS BEEN UNDER FUNDED FOR QUITE SOME LONG AS THERE IS A SORT OF GENERAL DISENCHANTMENT IN THE SERVICES
I THINK THE RAYS DOCTORS AS A WHOLE ARE SUFFERING FROM LOW MORALE JUST THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME IT'S THE LOWEST THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IT IN MORE THAN TEN YEARS IN THIS JOB
THE REAL TEST OF ALL OF THIS FOR PATIENTS WILL BE IN A FEW YEARS' TIME WILL IT BE EASIER AS A PATIENT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR G.P. WILL YOU BE MORE LIKELY TO SEE THE SAME G.P. IS THERE GOING TO BE MORE CONTINUITY IN THE SYSTEM IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE OTHER STAFF IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM EASILY AND WILL THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE IMPROVED YEAH INDEED JANE THANKS VERY MUCH WE WILL PURSUE THIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN NOW THE QUEEN IS NINETY PETER HUNT HURRAH CORRESPONDENCE ON THE LINE PETER WHAT'S PLANNED FOR THE DAY
WELL WE'LL SEE HER OUT AND ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN WINDSOR AND COME TO WINDSOR THERE'S A SORT OF A STRONG ALREADY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE WHO SLEPT OVERNIGHT I SHALL GO ON A WALKABOUT THROUGH THE MAIN PART OF WINDSOR THIS MORNING AND THEN THIS EVENING SHE WILL LIGHT A BEACON IT'S A TRADITIONAL THING TO DO IT AT THEIR CORONATIONS JUBILEES NOW FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND THEY'LL BE UP TO A THOUSAND ACROSS THE U.K. AND IN COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES AND THEN SHE BETTER RELAX ACTUALLY POTENTIAL A A PRIVATE
WHICH WILL BE HOSTED BY HER ELDEST SON THE PRINCE OF WALES FOR HER HER FAMILY AND HER CLOSE FRIENDS WITHIN THE CONFINES AND PRIVACY OF THE CASTLE WHAT A DINNER THAT WILL BE WHAT ARE COMING TOGETHER AS IT IS FOR ANYONE WHO REACHES NINETY BUT MIKE
GOODNESS WHEN YOU'VE HAD THE LIFE THAT SHE HAS HAD THE GATHERING ONE IMAGINES A BIG GREAT TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL
YES AND THAT'S WHY WE WON'T BE THERE I SHALL OF COURSE YES I KEEP CHECKING IN THE MALE MA'AM NOT THAT SORT OF FIRM SOLID CARD HASN'T ARRIVED BUT WE GET A SENSE USE YOU SUGGEST THAT'S A DYNASTY A CENTRE THAT IS IN THESE PICTURES THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED THERE ON THE FRONT PAGES
THE QUEEN'S ESCAPE RATHER LIKE THAT SHE WAS TAKEN BY ANY OF IT AS YOUR YOU DID JOHN LENNON NAKED CLINT EASTWOOD BOUND AND ROPES AND WERE NOT GOLDBERG IN A BATH OF MILK SO QUEEN'S VERY FORTUNATE SHE'S WITH FIVE SHE'S GOT THAT EXPRESSION THAT SAYS IN THOUGH NOT A BATH OF MILK YES
DON'T MESS WITH ME WHAT WHEN MISLEAD VITEZ LAST PHOTOGRAPH TO HER SHE DESCRIBED THE QUEEN AS FEISTY I THINK SHE MET HER MATCH THERE TALKING OF THE GENERATIONS OF THERE'S ONE
OF HER TWO YOUNGEST GRANDCHILDREN FIVE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN YOU'VE GOT PRINCESS CHARLOTTE ON HER LAP JUST A SORT OF ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE A BIT OF IT IS THIS MIA TYNDALL WHO'S OUR PHILLIPS'S DAUGHTER SHE'S VERY SORT OF CLUTCHING THIS RATHER LARGE KEY ELEMENT OF THE QUEEN'S LIFE WHICH WAS HER HAMP
AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING IN THAT
PEOPLE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME WHO'D WHO'D KNOWN AND MY HAND INDEED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE CALLED IN INTO US AND WANTED TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON THE QUEEN SHE SHE WE KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT HER AND YET OF COURSE A LITTLE AS WELL HE CRUCIAL ELEMENTS AND IS THAT IS THAT GOING TO BE HER INTENTION NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE AFTER THIS BERTHED IN THE WAY THAT SHE REGARDS HER JOB AND REGARDS THE MESH
IF YOU COULD BREAK IT JOHN EVER SO GENTLY SHE'S NOT I'LL DO AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM AND THAT'S THAT THAT IN A PARK
THAT IN PART IS THE KEY TO HER SUCCESS AND THAT WE CAN ALL IMAGINE WHAT SHE THINKS WE CAN ALL HAVE A FAIR GUESS AT WHAT SHE THINKS BUT SHE DOESN'T
ARTICULATED IN PUBLIC WHICH IS WHY OF COURSE THE WHOLE THAT WHOLE SUN HEADLINE ABOUT QUEEN BACKS BREAKS IT WAS POTENTIALLY SO TOXIC FOR THEM AND WHY THEY'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE HEADLINE SAYING IT IS IRANIAN WASN'T BORNE OUT BY THE ARTICLE BECAUSE SHE SHALL WHAT
WHAT SHE DOES IS THE MOST AS YOU SUGGEST MOST RECOGNISABLE POTENTIALLY WOMAN ON THE PLANET YET STILL SHE REMAINS AN ENIGMA AND WE GET VERY FEW CRUMBS FROM THE TABLE AS TO WHAT IT IS ABOUT I THINK WHAT WE DO
IS THAT SHE ENJOYS THE JOB AND I THINK THAT'S A KEY SHE SAID IN B.B.C. DOCUMENTARIES IN THE PAST WHEN SHE DID GIVE SOME INSIGHT SHE LIKES THE REGIMENTED NATURE OF IT SHE LIKES THE FACTION KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING
SHE LIKES ALL THAT ROUTINE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS KEY WITH IF YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR THIS LONG AND CONTINUE TO I THINK WHAT THE THE NEVER TO BE OBSCENE THING IS WHAT WILL SHE CARRY ON DOING IS THERE ANY SENSE OF SLOWING DOWN AND STOPPING AT MY NOTES I TOOK FROM
FOR HER EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY WITH A SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE TOP LINE IS THERE'S NO EXPECTATION OF HER GOING OFF TO THE BAHAMAS NEXT WEEK AND I SUSPECT IF THE SAME OFFICIAL WAS IN HIS OR HER JOB THIS WEEK YOU'D SAY THE SAME I THINK WHAT'LL SEE HE'S OUT AND ABOUT A SCREEN BUT TO THE SORT OF THE SOPHISTICATED EITHER SEASONED OBSERVER WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT MAYBE THE PROGRAMME ISN'T QUITE A STRENUOUS AND IT WON IT QUITE AS LONG BUT SHE WILL CARRY ON BEING QUEEN BEE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY TO EIGHT ACRES OF COVERAGE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT OF THAT STORY IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE FRONT PAGES OF THE MAIL AND THE MIRROR AMONG THOSE SHOWING THAT NEW PHOTO THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OF THE QUEEN WITH HER SEVEN YOUNGEST GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN THE PICTURES CAPTAIN HAPPY BIRTHDAY GREAT GRANNY AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WHICH IS APPARENTLY WHAT PRINCE GEORGE CALLS AT THE SUN'S HEADLINE HAPPY AND GLORIOUS NINETIETH MA'AM OF THE MALE OWL EYES THAT YOUNG ROYALS HE CALLS CHEEKY LITTLE MIA TYNDALL WHO WAS PETER SAID CAN BE SEEN PROUDLY HOLDING UP A GREAT GRANNY'S HANDBAG QUEEN SHARES THE FRONT PAGES WITH A WOMAN SOME CALLED THE QUEEN OF COMEDY MANY REFLECTING ON THEIR TALENT TO VICTORIA WOOD HAS DIED OF COURSE FROM CANCER AT THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO BRAVE BRILLIANT AND BELOVED IS THE TIMES VERDICT A NEW DAY SAYS GOODBYE TO THE WOMAN WHO MADE WOMEN LAUGH
AND HER LONG TERM COLLABORATOR DUNCAN PRESTON TELLS THE MIRROR THAT HER GIFT WAS TO SEE THAT COMEDY IS IN REAL PEOPLE THE GUARDIAN CALLS A RELUCTANT NATIONAL TREASURE NASH SAYS SHE WAS THE AUTHENTIC VOICE WHO ARE OPTIMISTIC DECENT UNPRETENTIOUS TAKE PEOPLE AS THEY COME MUCKING IN SORT OF BRITISHNESS
THE TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH A STORY THAT SAYS ONE IN THREE TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF PLOTTING ATTACKS IN THIS COUNTRY WAS ABLE TO ENTER THIS COUNTRY AFTER TRAINING ABROAD IT HAS ANALYSED CASES GOING BACK SIXTEEN YEARS AND SAYS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO IMPROVE BORDER SECURITY TELEGRAPH CLAIMS OF POLICE FORCES ARE REGULARLY ALONE BRITAIN'S TO TRAVEL IF THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP BUT THEN FAILED TO QUESTION THEM ON THEIR RETURN
IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES AMONG THOSE REPORTING U.N. FEARS THAT MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MIGRANTS DIED AFTER A SHIPWRECK IN THE MEDITERRANEAN LAST WEEK THE PAPER TELLS HOW A GROUP OF FORTY ONE SURVIVORS SAY THEY WERE PART OF A LARGER GROUP WHO WERE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A LARGER VESSEL AT SEA WHEN IT CAPSIZED THE SURVIVORS WERE THE ONES WHO STAYED IN THE SMALLER BOAT AND SPENT THREE DAYS THEN DRIFTING AT SEA BEFORE BEING MESSY
IT IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN JEREMY CORBIN CALLED ON DAVID CAMERON YESTERDAY TO EXPLAIN HIS PLANS TO TURN ALL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND INTO ACADEMIES AND M.P.S ON THE TREASURY COMMITTEE SPENT THREE HOURS ASKING A LEADING CAMPAIGNER IN THE LEAF CAMPAIGN TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE CHAIRMAN DESCRIBED AS HIS EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS ABOUT THE E.U. A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN REPORTS
PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS CAN BE A TESTING TIME FOR A POLITICAL LEADER PARTY TENSIONS ARE ON DISPLAY LOYALISTS WILL ALWAYS CHEER WHATEVER YOU SAY BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD WHEN MOST OF YOUR M. PEAS STAY QUIET DRAWING THE EXCHANGES ESPECIALLY IF THE OTHER SIDE IS UNITED
PRIME MINISTER EXPLAIN WHY HE IS INTENT ON FORCING GOOD AND OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS TO BECOME ACADEMIES
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN USED ALL OF HIS QUESTIONS TO CALL ON DAVID CAMERON TO DROPPED PLANS TO FORCE EVERY STATE SCHOOL IN ENGLAND TO BECOME AN ACADEMY AND THUS INDEPENDENT OF LOCAL AUTHORITY CONTROL THE OPPOSITION LEADER ENJOYED VOCAL SUPPORT FROM HIS BACKBENCHERS MANY CONSERVATIVES WERE SILENT SOME OF ALREADY GONE PUBLIC WITH THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLICY AND AS MISTER CORBIN POINTED OUT THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO WERE UNHAPPY
TEACHERS PARENTS AND SCHOOL GOVERNORS AND LOCAL COUNCIL
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID HE WANTED HEAD TEACHERS TO RUN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN BUREAUCRATS
IF YOU LOOK AT CONVERTER ACADEMY IS EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THEM ARE EITHER GOOD OR OUTSTANDING AND YOU LOOK AT SCHOOLS STARTED BY ACADEMIES THEY SEE A TEN PER CENT IMPROVEMENT ON AVERAGE OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS THE RESULTS ARE BETTER EDUCATION'S IMPROVING I SAY LET'S COMPLETE THE WORK
BUT JEREMY CORBIN HAD COME PREPARED WITH A LIST OF CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS WHO WEREN'T CONVINCED BY WHAT THE LABOUR LEADER CALLED THIS TOP DOWN REORGANISATION
IF THAT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY FAMILIAR IT'S BECAUSE THE PHRASE WAS LAST DEPLOYED IN ANGER JOINED A LONG RUNNING ROW ABOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATION WHICH MADE BIG CHANGES TO THE HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND MY CORBIN ALSO SHARED THE VIEWS OF SOME PEOPLE HE'D MET RECENTLY
NOW IF YOU HAVE AMBITIONS TO BE QUOTED BY A SENIOR POLITICIAN IN PARLIAMENT OR IN A BIG SPEECH MAKE SURE YOU AGREE WITH THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY BETTER STILL USE THE LANGUAGE AND PHRASES THEY USE
EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY ELEVEN ARE YEAR SIX PUPILS WERE VERY INTERESTING EAMONN OR MARY ASKED ME TO SAY THIS TO THE PRIME MINISTER
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS THEY LOVE THEIR SCHOOL THEY LIKE THE SCHOOL THE WAY IT IS THEY DON'T WANT ANY TOP DOWN REORGANISATION DAVID CAMERON SAID THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS TO WORK TOGETHER
THERE WILL BE GENUINE FAMILIES OF SCHOOLS FAMILIES THAT SHOES TO GROUP TOGETHER AND HERE'S THE POINT ABOUT OUTSTANDING SCHOOL'S NOT ONLY WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GET BETTER BUT IN GROUPS OF ACADEMIES THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HELP OTHER SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE
THAT WAS A BRIEF INTERLUDE BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION RESUMED MY CAMERON WAS ASKED REFERENDUM RELATED QUESTIONS BUT THE REAL DRAMA TOOK PLACE A FEW HOURS LATER IN A COMMITTEE ROOM COURTESY OF THE CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR OF THE VOTE TO LEAVE GROUP DOMINIC CUMMINGS
WE'VE SEEN WHAT AN IMPORTANT WE CLAN HUNTER GEOLOGIST DONE OF THE LASTING NEGOTIATIONS ALL THESE GUYS CAN'T TO GO PAPER BUT THAT WAS HIS VERDICT ON OFFICIALS AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND HE DOESN'T THINK MUCH OF THE CITY OF LONDON EITHER WHY ALWAYS AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND J.P. MORGAN YOU DROVE THE ECONOMY OFF A CLIFF IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
THESE BANKS OFTEN BEHAVED DISGRACEFULLY THEY PAY THEM SO THEY PAY THEMSELVES DISGRACEFULLY
DOMINIC CUMMINGS WAS A SPECIAL ADVISER TO MICHAEL GAVE WHEN HE WAS EDUCATION SECRETARY HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BLOOD SPEAKING AND THERE WERE SOME SPIKY EXCHANGES BETWEEN MISTER CUMMINGS AND THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ANDREW TYREE RIGHT AT THE START OF THE SESSION OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE U.K.'S REBATE FROM THE E.U.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU BUT IT NEVER LEAVES THE U.K. ITS DEVOTEES DES IS DEPUTY FOR ME O.K.
FOR THE WHOLE OF THIS PERIOD IT NEVER LEADS TO YOU KAY IT NEVER CROSSES BITS CHANGES WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN YOUR SLIPPERS TALKING TO MISSUS TIRING YOU KNOW LOOK AT YOUR BANK STATEMENTS AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR BANK STATEMENT OF EXCESS X. AMOUNT OF MONEY IS DEBITED FROM YOUR ACCOUNT
THAT MEANS IT'S GONE FROM YOUR ACCOUNT DOESN'T IT LATER MY COMING SUGGESTED THAT BRITISH FIRMS HAD BEEN WARNED OFF FROM BACKING HER VOTE TO LEAVE THE E. U.
ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE IN THE CABINET OFFICE CALL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND MAKE A THREATS SOME MORE OVERT IN SOME MORE COVERT
THE HEARING LASTED MORE THAN THREE HOURS AS IT DREW TO A CLOSE ANDREW TYREE SAID DOMINIC CUMMINGS HAD MADE SOME EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS HE SAID THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME WRITTEN EVIDENCE TO BACK THEM

PEOPLE WANT TRENDS I'M GOING TO BENEFIT OUT OF THIS
THAT THE MOVE TO BECOME A REPUBLIC COULD BE SEEN AS A FADING RELATIONSHIP WITH BRITAIN WOULD YOU MAKE AS PRIME MINISTER SAYS LINKS WILL BE RETAINED WITH THE BRITISH CROWN THROUGH THE CON
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPORTANT I'VE GOT SMALL CONTRARY MAKE JAMAICA AS A VOICE IN A FORUM

ALL THIS WEEK
AS THE QUEEN TURNS NINETY JAMAICA IS KEEN TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUE INDEPENDENCE AND IDENTITY AND WHETHER THE ROYAL SEAL OF APPROVAL IS STILL NEEDED

NORTHERN IRELAND THE SOUTHERN HALF OF SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN ENGLAND THE NORTH MIDLANDS TOO SHOULD HAVE A QUITE A SUNNY AFTERNOON HE TEMPERATURES WERE WIDELY GET UP TO AROUND FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN BUT THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU WHILE THE CLOUDIER THE SKIES ARE GOING TO BE IN FACT IT LOOKS LIKE THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND MANY OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY OVERCAST THROUGH THE DAY WE'VE ALREADY HAD A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN EVEN IN CORNWALL AND DEVON AND THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF DAYLIGHT HOURS
TONIGHT WE'VE GOT A TOUCH OF FROST ON THE WAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE U.K. THE SOUTHERN HALF WILL BE FROST FREE AND THEN TOMORROW THERE'S A BIT OF RAIN ON THE WAY FOR THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES WHICH MAY REACH LONDON TO THEN COME THE WEEKEND FOR THE MARATHON RUNNERS IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A COLD NORTHERLY WIND WITH A CHANCE OF ONE OR TWO HAIL SHOWERS
I THINK ABOUT THAT SHOWER IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE MIGRANT CRISIS PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEWS THAT APPARENTLY AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE DIED LAST WEEK DURING ONE A SHIPPING DISASTER AT SEA IN THE MEDITERRANEAN PLUS AS WELL THE ROW IN LABOUR'S RANKS OVER MCDONNELL SHOULD MCDONALD'S OR SHOULD THEY NOT BE ALLOWED TO COME INDEED BE WELCOME AT THE PARTY'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE
TODAY IS THE NINETIETH BIRTHDAY OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TWENTY FIRST OF APRIL HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE N.H.S. IS TO INJECT ALMOST TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS TO IMPROVE G.P. SERVICES IN ENGLAND A REPORTER SUGGESTED MINISTERS HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO MEET THEIR DEFENCE SPENDING TARGET BY CREATIVE ACCOUNTING DAVID CAMERON HAS LED TRIBUTES TO THE QUEEN ON HER NINETIETH BIRTHDAY CALLING HER ROCK OF STRENGTH FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD OF B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY KRYSTLE
ALMOST TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS OF THE EXTRA MONEY ALREADY PROMISED FOR THE HEALTH SERVICES TO BE USED TO HELP UNDER PRESSURE G.P.S IN ENGLAND N.H.S. LEADERS SAY THE FINANCIAL PACKAGE WILL ALLOW UNDERFUNDED SURGERIES TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET THEY HOPE TO DOUBLE THE RECRUITMENT RATE OF G.P.S FUND OTHER STAFF IN SURGERY'S SUCH AS PHARMACISTS AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EVENING AND WEEKEND APPOINTMENTS PATIENTS WILL ALSO BE ENCOURAGED TO USE ONLINE SERVICES HERE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
ENGLAND'S G.P. SURGERIES ARE UNDER HUGE PRESSURE WITH PATIENTS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO GET APPOINTMENTS AND FAMILY DOCTORS FEELING OVERBURDENED THIS PLAN BY THE HEAD OF N.H.S. ENGLAND SIMON STEVENS WILL SEE FURTHER MONEY START GOING TO G.P.S NOW FROM THE EXTRA FUNDS ALREADY PROMISED FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE
WE KNOW THAT AS WE GOT AN AGEING POPULATION A GROWING POPULATION
WE ARE GOING TO LEAD TO EXPAND ACCESS TO G.P. SERVICES BUT ALSO PUT IN PLACE NEW TYPES OF CARE ACCESS TO A PHARMACISTS TO NURSES TO A PSYCHOLOGIST
AND A BETTER WAY OF LINKING WHAT G.P.S DO WITH WHAT HOSPITALS DO G.P. LEADERS SAY THIS IS A VITAL STEP TOWARDS THEIR CALL TO RECEIVE ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE N.H.S. BUDGET THE PLANS ACKNOWLEDGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOCTORS MAY NEED TO BE RECRUITED FROM OVERSEAS
N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS THE MONEY WILL FUND OTHER STAFF IN SURGERIES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS AND CLINICAL PHARMACISTS TO GIVE PATIENTS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF HELP G.P. LEADERS SAY THE PLANS ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THERE WATCH CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THE COMMITMENTS ARE DELIVERED
A GROUP OF M.P.S HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF USING CREATIVE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES TO MEET THE NATO TARGETED SPENDING TWO PER CENT OF G.D.P. ON DEFENCE THE DEFENCE COMMITTEE SAYS WELL NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SEVERAL MAJOR EXPENDITURES SUCH AS WAR PENSIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED ELSEWHERE THE M.O.D. INSISTS IT'S ACCOUNTS FIRMLY FOR WITHIN NATO'S GUIDELINES THE COMMITTEE'S CHAIRMAN JULIAN LEWIS SAYS MORE CLARITY IS NEEDED
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THEY WOULD GIVE US A STRAIGHTFORWARD BREAKDOWN OF WHAT NEW MUMMY AND WHAT ISN'T AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE COME OUT WITH AS A CALCULATION
IF THEY HAVEN'T BROUGHT IN THESE OTHER SUMS THAT THEY DIDN'T USED TO COUNT WE BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE COME IN AT A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE TWO PER SE

ACCORDING TO THERESA MAY BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS AT RISK OF BEING UNDERMINED BY MONEY LAUNDERING ILLICIT FINANCE AND THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM MISSUS MAY HAS ALREADY SET UP AN INTELLIGENCE TASK FORCE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM AND IS NOW PLANNING TO GIVE THE CIVIL COURTS POWERS TO IMPOSE NEW UNEXPLAINED WEALTH ORDERS IF PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF MONEY LAUNDERING FAILED TO SHOW HOW THEY OBTAINED THEIR WEALTH THEIR MONEY WILL BE FORFEITED
THE HOME SECRETARY ALSO INTENDS TO ESTABLISH A CRIMINAL OFFENCE OF ILLICIT ENRICHMENT IT WOULD APPLY TO M.P.S LOCAL COUNCILLORS CIVIL SERVANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHOSE ASSETS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND WITHOUT SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
A CHARITY LEADING EFFORTS TO COMBAT ABUSIVE IMAGES ON THE INTERNET SAYS IT'S MANAGED TO GET NEARLY SEVENTY THOUSAND PICTURES AND VIDEOS OF ONLINE CHILD SEX ABUSE REMOVED IN THE LAST YEAR THE INTERNET WATCH FOUNDATIONS HAS NEARLY SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE VICTIMS ON THE IMAGES WERE THOUGHT TO BE AGED TEN OR UNDER HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DOMINIC CATCHING ON
THE CHARITY WAS SET UP WITH THE SUPPORT OF POLICE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TWENTY YEARS AGO TO COLLATE REPORTS OF ABUSE IMAGES SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN IT'S HAD THE BACKING OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ACTIVELY SEARCH THEM OUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A CRIME AND ITS ANNUAL REPORT REVEALS A MASSIVE JUMP AND IDENTIFIED MATERIAL
THE SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PAGES FOUND LAST YEAR INCLUDED NINETEEN THOUSAND IMAGES OF THE WORST KINDS OF ASSAULTS IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES INTERNET COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD DELETED THE MATERIAL WITHIN TWO HOURS HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT
SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT AN EXHIBITION BY THE ARTIST DAMIEN HIRST INCLUDING DEAD ANIMALS PRESERVED IN GIANT TANKS RELEASED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FORMALDEHYDE FUMES AT THE TATE MODERN IN LONDON A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL ANALYTICAL METHODS SO THE LEVELS OF THE GAS AT THE TWENTY TWELVE EXHIBITION WERE ABOVE THOSE LEGALLY PERMITTED BUT THE SCIENTISTS THE MUSEUM SAY THE PUBLIC WERE NOT AT RISK JANE FRANCES KELLY REPORTS
THE WORKS OF ART WERE SHOWN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AT TATE MODERN THEY INCLUDED TO PRESERVE LAMB CALLED AWAY FROM THE FLOCK AND ANOTHER NAMED MOTHER AND CHILD DIVIDED WHICH EIGHT FOUR TANKS CONTAINING A CALF AND CAL CUT DOWN THE MIDDLE SCIENTIST FROM ITALY WHO WERE TESTING A NEW SENSOR DESIGNED TO MONITOR FOR MILDER HIDE FUMES FOUND THE LEVELS OF GAS LEAKING FROM ONE OF THE EXHIBITS WAS TEN TIMES ABOVE THE ADVISED LIMIT
A SPOKESMAN FOR TATE MODERN SAID IT ALWAYS PUT THE SAFETY OF ITS STAFF AND VISITORS FIRST AND SAID THE WORKS CONTAINED A VERY DILUTE FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTION THAT WAS CONTAINED WITHIN SEALED TANKS THE SCIENTIST WHO LEAD THE STUDY ALSO SAID HE DIDN'T THINK VISITORS HAVE BEEN PUT AT RISK
JANE FRANCES KELLY REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN G.P.S ARE THE FRONTLINE OF THE N.H.S. MANY BELIEVE THAT IF THEY PROVIDE A GOOD SERVICE EVERYTHING ELSE FALLS INTO PLACE THEY'LL BE LESS PRESSURE ON HOSPITALS AND SO ON AND MANY PRACTICES ARE NOT PROVIDING A GOOD SERVICE PARTICULARLY IN THE INNER CITIES WHERE IT'S BECOME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO RECRUIT NEW DOCTORS WHEN OLDER ONES RETIRE OR PACK IT IN BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ALL OF WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE MAN WHO RUNS THE N.H.S. IS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THAT G.P.S ARE GOING TO GET A BIGGER SLICE OF THE CAKE ALL I'M JOINED BY MAUREEN BAKER DOCTOR MIND BAKERLOO CHAIRS THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S GOOD MORNING TO YOU HONEY IS THIS SIMPLY MORE MONEY FOR G.P.S
WELL IT'S MORE THAN MONEY TO RUN THE SERVICE OF GENERAL PRACTICE G.P.S AND THEY PRACTICE TEAM SEE OVER A MILLION PEOPLE EVERY DAY EVERY WORKING DAY IN THE N.H.S. AND THEY PREVAILED OVER NINETY PERCENT OF CONTACTS WITH THE N.H.S. AND AT THE MOMENT THE FUNDING FOR THE SERVICE OF GENERAL PRACTICE IS AROUND ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE N.H.S. BUDGET
AND YOU SAY IT SHOULD BE WHAT WILL WE SEE IT SHOULD BE AROUND ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT AND THIS FUNDING COMMITMENT TAKES US TO ROUND ABOUT THAT FIGURE VERY CLOSE TO IT HOW MUCH ARE THEY ER NO TYPICAL G.P.
WELL THE AVERAGE G.P. SALARY IS A BOAT FOR A PARTNER IT IS AROUND ABOUT NINETY FOUR THOUSAND BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS ABOUT THIS FUNDING IS TO RUN THIS SERVICE OF GENERAL PRACTICE AND TO PAY FOR THE STAFF THEY NOSH SEES THE PHARMACIST THE OTHER THERAPISTS WILL BE HALVING IN THE SOUR KIDDIES AND TO MAKE THE WHOLE SERVICE WACKFORD PATIENTS IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU P.P.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY NINETY FOUR GRAND'S NOT BAD US QUITE A LOT OF MONEY REALLY CERTAINLY CAPOTE WHAT MOST PEOPLE EARN SO WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO BRING ATTRACT MORE G.P.S MORE DOCTORS INTO THE G.P. SERVICE
SO OF COURSE THERE THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY G.P.S ARE HIGHLY SKILLED EXPERT PROFESSIONALS AND THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT UM IN FACT G.P. SO HE'S LIKE OTHER CELL ISN'T PUBLIC SECTOR HEALTH FULL POO NUMBER IF YOU WISH BUT IT'S NOT WHAT G. PIECE APPEARED IT'S THE FACT THAT
THE PRESSURE AND YOU KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND GIVING THE APPOINTMENTS RUNNING THE SERVICE FOR PATIENTS IN SOME E.D.S. HAS BECOME ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE AND ACTUALLY G.P. SURGERIES HAVE HAD TO CLOSE A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE SO IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE AVERAGE G.P. P. IT'S ABOUT REASONABLE FUNDING THE REASONABLE FUNDING COMMITMENT REQUIRED
TO RUN THE SERVICE FOR PATIENTS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET THAT WITHOUT FIRST QUESTION WHERE WILL THIS MONEY GO THAT'S THE THING WILL IT GO INTO THE G.P.S' PAY PACKET AT THE END OF THE MONTH OR WILL IT GO INTO THE PRACTICE SO THAT THERE CAN BE MORE MORE NURSES AS YOU SAY AND ALL THE REST OF IT TO MAKING THEM MORE EFFICIENT PRACTICE
WHILE THE FUNDING COMMITMENT OVER A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS AND EVERY YEAR AT THE CONTRACT WILL BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN COLLEAGUES SNIPPY ANY AND N.H.S. ENGLAND BUT IN THE CONTRACT THEY'RE ALL THEIR THINGS
PRACTICES HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR STAFF THEIR MANAGEMENT THAT ADMIN THE CLAIM HE SEES ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO TO RUN THE PRACTICE AND YES THEY'RE PIGGY BUT THEIR P. IS ACTUALLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE OVERALL CONTRACT AND THERE IS A GUARANTEE GUARANTEE THERE IS THE HOPE THAT THIS WILL ATTRACT MANY MORE DOCTORS INTO THE PROFESSION ARE THEY OUT THERE ARE THEY ARE THEY THEY'RE SAY WELL MAYBE I'LL BECOME A G.P. MAY BILL ON OR DO WE SIMPLY NEED TO TRAIN MORE DOCTORS FULL STOP
THIS IS A HUGE STATEMENT OF FAITH AND CONFIDENCE AND FOUL YOU IN THE FUTURE OF GENERAL PRACTICE AND YOUNG DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS AND EVEN DOT TO SWIFT THINKING SHALL I STAY SHOULD REALLY SEE THIS AS A HUGE BOOK OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR PROFESSION SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS THAT COMMITMENT TO THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE TO A BEGGAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THEIR TIME IS THIRTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE'RE HEARING THIS MORNING FROM SOME OF OUR LISTENERS WHO LIKE THE QUEEN A TURNING NINETY TODAY THE TENOR FROM BERYL COATS IS FROM STOURBRIDGE
I'M BERYL CARROTS AND I HAVE A VERY HAPPY PLEASURE OF SHARING THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY ON THE TWENTY FIRST OF APRIL SAME DAY SAME AGE I TOOK MY OWN NICE TO SEE THE QUEEN WHEN SHE CAME TO BIRMINGHAM JUST AFTER HER FATHER DIED
AND WHEN SHE GOT OUT OF THE CAR SHE WAS ALL IN BLACK AND SHE WAS SO TYRONE AYE AYE IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL SKIN AND A VOICE TO DIE FOR BUT SHE WAS SO LOVELY AND

COME ON JUSTIN WHAT'S THE PLAN TODAY WHERE THE PLAN TODAY IS TO GET A CRACKING PICTURE OF THE QUEEN IN A LOVELY NEW OUTFIT I THINK SHE'S GOT A CHOICE OF THREE UNNOTICED
IT'S REALLY REALLY COLOURFUL WHICH IT WILL BE THEN LIKE THE BEACON AT SEVEN TONIGHT THEN THAT'S IT WHAT A GOES OFF AND PARTIES WHAT I DOING USING ANNIE OF IT WHEN THEY'VE GOT YOU
IT'S A COURSE CAN GET SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN AND THE QUEEN ALL LOOKING AT THE CAMERA AT THE SAME TIME MAYBE NO ONE ELSE O.K. YES I WAS GOING TO HUNT WAS SAYING IT'S EMMA PART THE QUEEN IS CAPTURED WITH HER CORGIS THEY KNOW NOTHING OF HER STATUS IN OTHER WORDS THAT'S RIGHT YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS GETTING IT ALL TOGETHER
SHE DID A BRILLIANT JOB GOING THROUGH THE CORGIS LOOKING AT AS WELL BUT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IT A LONG TIME AND YOU HAVE WATCHED HER IN THAT TIME SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT OLDER WE'VE ALL GOT OLDER YOU'VE GOT OLDER HAS SHE CHANGED HAS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS CHANGED HAS OUR AVAILABILITY HER ACCESSIBILITY
NO I THINK SHE'S STILL A VERY FORMIDABLE THERE WHEN SHE WORKS
BUT OFF DUTY MOMENTS YOU KNOW I REMEMBER ONCE AT WINDSOR HORSE YARD JUST AFTER I'VE GOT MY M.B.E. SHEETS YOU COME UP TO ME AND SAID WHY ARE YOU NOT WEARING YOUR MEDAL TODAY WHICH TOOK ME BY SURPRISE AND COMPLETE SHOCK SO SHE CAN OCCASIONALLY SURPRISING BUT THE QUEEN IS
I MEAN SHE'S JUST LIKE CLOCKWORK I MEAN YESTERDAY SHE DID TWO ENGAGEMENTS BUT THAT'S A NORMAL DAY'S WORK FOR HER AND YOU KNOW LISTENING TO THAT LADY AT NINETY EARLIER YOU KNOW THE QUEEN MAYBE NINETY BUT SHE CERTAINLY
AND THAT ACTS LIKE A WOMAN OF TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER WHEN I WATCHED HER YESTERDAY VERY CLOSELY OPEN IN THE BANDSTAND IN WINDSOR AND I JUST LOOKED AND I THOUGHT MY GOD YOU CAN'T BE NINETY COS YOU JUST YOU'RE SO FIT SO AGILE SO JUST INCREDIBLY YOUNG LOOKING SO
FOR ME I'M NOT SURE THEY MIGHT HAVE GOT THE BEST OF IT WRONG AND YOUR EXPECTATION IS YOU CARRY ON FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS
YEAH WHY NOT BECAUSE HER MOTHER LIVED TO ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED AND I THINK THE QUEEN'S GOT THE JEANS AND SHE'S GOT THE WILL TO DO IT THE THING IS IF THE QUEEN WOKE UP ONE DAY THINKING I COULD NO LONGER CARRY OUT MY DUTIES SHE WOULD PROBABLY HAND IT OVER BUT
WHILE SHE'S STILL FIT AND ABLE SHE'S GOING TO JUST GROW BEST FOR ARTHUR YOU CAN DO THIS FAR AS WERE MENTIONED IN THE PROGRAMME JOHN AS A KIND OF STANDING REQUEST JOHN HUNT WAS THE SETTING NEST MINISTER STANDING REQUEST TO INTERVIEW HER BIG GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT LATER TODAY WOULDN'T YOU COULD YOU COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN WOULD YOU PUT IN A WAY I THINK SO I THINK SO I REMEMBER WHEN JOHN GAVE HER THE CLOCK WHEN THE B. B. WE'RE IN THE PRETTY LOOSE AND SAID
THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH IS NOT YO SHE SAID TO HIM SHE'S NOT ILL I'M NOT YOU ALL RIGHT CLEAR IF IT HAPPENS YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO PHOTOGRAPH I THINK SO THANKS A LOT
IF THEY DIE AS IN THE GOVERNMENT THE TREASURY GOING TO GET TOUGH WITH THE MONEY LAUNDER THE HOME SECRETARY HERSELF IS GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS LUCY BUT WHO IS A SORT OF NEW FACE THIS MORNING ANYWAY ON BUSINESS SEEN LUCY WAS HAPPENING WITH BILLIONS OF POUNDS AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL MONEY IS ESTIMATED TO BE LAUNDERED THROUGH THE U.K. EVERY YEAR AND AS YOU SAY TODAY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY WILL SET OUT NEW POWERS TO CLAMP DOWN ON IT
SHE SAYS THE U.K.'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS AT RISK OF BEING UNDERMINED MY MONEY LAUNDERING LESS AT FINANCE AND THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM ROBERT BARRINGTON IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL YOU KEN HE JOINS US FROM THE B.B.C.'S STUDIO IN BRIGHTON GOOD MORNING ROBERT GOOD MORNING NOW YOU DON'T TEND TO THINK OF THE U.K. IS A MASSIVE MONEY LAUNDERING HUB SO HOW BAD IS THE PROBLEM HERE IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY BIRD AND THE NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS AT LEAST HE'S LAUNDERED THROUGH THE U.K. U.K.
AND THAT'S BOTH MONEY GENERATED WITHIN THE U.K. FROM ORGANISED CRIME AND DRUGS AND SO ON AND ALSO FOREIGN CORRUPT MONEY THAT COMES THROUGH THE U.K. AND IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY IN THE U.K. ITSELF WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CROWN DEPENDENCIES LIKE THE CHANNEL ISLANDS ON THE OVERSEAS TERRITORIES LIKE THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND THAT'S ANOTHER BIG PART OF THE GLOBAL PICTURE SO OVERALL THE U.K. HAS A PRETTY BIG ROLE IN THIS GLOBALLY NOW ONE OF THE MEASURES THAT THERESA MAY'S GOING TO INTRODUCE IS AN UNEXPLAINED WEALTH ORDER HOW'S THAT GOING
IT WORKS LIKE THIS THAT IF YOU'RE A FOREIGN OFFICIAL LAW WHOEVER IT APPLIES TO AND YOU HAVE ASSETS THAT CAN'T BE EXPLAINED BETTER OF CLEARLY SUSPICIOUS ORIGIN THEN THE AUTHORITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO FREEZE THOSE FOR A PERIOD WHILE YOU GET THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY WERE LEGITIMATELY OBTAINED AND IF YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT THEN THEY REMAIN FROZEN HOW DO YOU POLICE LIKE OF COURSE HE COULD ACQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WITHOUT RECEIPTS THROUGH LEGAL GAMBLING FOR EXAMPLE
YES YOU COULD AND THERE HAVE TO BE SAFEGUARDS PUT IN PLACE AROUND IT AND ALL SORTS OF WAYS AND THAT'S WHY THIS NEEDS TO GO THROUGH PARLIAMENT IN BE PROPERLY DEBATED SO CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE PROTECTED BUT THESE ORDERS THE UNEXPLAINED WEALTH ORDERS ALREADY EXIST IN IRELAND AND AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE SO THERE IS PRECEDENT IN HOW THEY CAN BE USED NOW THIS WAS OF COURSE IN THE OFFING BEFORE THE PANAMA PAPERS LEEK BRIEFLY SHED OR INDEED COULD THE GOVERNMENT GO EVEN FURTHER AND MIGHT HAVE THAT SCANDAL
YES THE GOVERNMENT SURE SHOULD I'M IN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT COULD DO WOULD BE TO TAKE ACTION WITH THE OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND CROWN DEPENDENCIES THAT'S A BIG HOLE IN THE SYSTEM THERE ISN'T ISN'T ADDRESSED HERE I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS HERE ARE PRETTY BOLD AND IMAGINATIVE AND THAT'S A GOOD THING THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING WILL BE IF THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THEM BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE THINGS BEING PUT UP FOR CONSULTATION SO IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO DO THEM YET ROBERT BARRINGTON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU LUCY TWENTY PAST SEVEN BARACK OBAMA'S COMING TO BRITAIN HIS LAST TRIP WE CAN ASSUME BEFORE HIS PRESIDENCY ENDS AND THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT WAS QUITE A BANG REALLY BIG INTERVENTION IN THE EUROPE REFERENDUM DEBATE
SO WHERE WILL THAT LEAVE THE POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AMERICA AND BRITAIN SPECIAL OR ESSENTIAL OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED JOHN CYCLE IS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR
WILL HE TIPTOE OR WILL THE U.S. PRESIDENT TO BE WEARING HOBNAILED BOOTS WHEN BARACK OBAMA STANDS NEXT TO DAVID CAMERON IN THE DOWNING STREET GARDEN AND HE'S ASKED THE INEVITABLE QUESTION ABOUT BRECK SIT IN HIS FINAL MONTHS IN OFFICE IT SEEMED THAT CANDOUR HAS REPLACED CAUTION AND HE WAS CERTAINLY PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THE ISSUE WHEN I INTERVIEWED HIM AT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST SUMMER HERB
THE UNITED KINGDOM IN THE EUROPEAN UNION GIVES US MUCH GREATER CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF THE TRANSATLANTIC
AND IS PART OF THE CORNER STONE OF INSTITUTIONS BUILT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO
THAT HAS MADE
THE WORLD SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS AND WE
TO MAKE SURE OF THAT YOU KNOW KINGDOM CONTINUES TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE VALUES THAT WE SHARE THE RIGHT ONE'S NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES BUT FOR EUROPE AS A WHOLE AND THE WORLD
BUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE HIS SPELL OUT WHAT HE THINKS THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OF A BRITISH DEPARTURE DIZZY BELIEVE IT WOULD DAMAGE THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP DESTABILISE UP A EUROPEAN ECONOMIES LESS AND BRITAIN'S POSITION IN THE WORLD
HIS ADVISORS THINK SO BUT WILLIE SAY SO PUBLICLY CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN ENORMOUS PRESSURE FROM LEAF CAMPAIGNERS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO KEEP STILL
MERAK AND GAVE HAVE PLAYED PING PONG TOGETHER FLIP BURGERS GONE TO THE BASKETBALL
AND EATEN HOT DOGS AT TIMES THEY'VE REALLY LOOKED LIKE BEST THESE BUT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP ALSO MEANS BEING CANDID THAT'S WHAT WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY WILL GUIDE THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON BRECHT'S IT THAT'S WHAT'S BROUGHT SOME PRETTY BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF NATO COUNTRIES MAINTAINING DEFENCE SPENDING
LED TO A FURIOUS ROW LAST YEAR WHEN IT SEEMED BRITAIN WAS ABOUT TO CUT THE M.O.D. BUDGET THE PRESIDENT APPARENTLY TELLING MISTER CAMERON THAT BRITAIN HAD TO PAY ITS FAIR SHARE THE PRESIDENT'S SOUGHT TO PLAY IT DOWN WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM I WOULDN'T SAY PRESSURE I THINK I HAD AN HONEST CONVERSATION WITH DAVID AND THEY'RE BAD
GREAT BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR BEST PARTNER WELL I GUESS YOU COULD GO BACK TO EIGHTEEN TWELVE YEAH TRYING TO BURN THIS RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY BUT IN A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH ATLANTIC MAGAZINE THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNED WHAT HE CALLED EUROPEAN FREE RIDERS WHO JUST LOOKED TO AMERICA TO DO ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING ON DEFENCE
HE WAS EVEN MORE POINTED ABOUT BRITAIN AND FRANCE HIS ROLE IN LIBYA HE TOLD FOX LAST WEEK THAT THE MESS THAT LIBYA HAD BECOME WAS HIS GREATEST FAILURE WORST MISTAKE PROBABLY FAILING TO PLAN FOR
AFTER WHAT I THINK WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING OLIVIA AND HE POINTED THE FINGER AT DAVID CAMERON TO ACCUSING THE PRIME MINISTER OF HAVING BECOME DISTRACTED AFTER THE TWENTY ELEVEN INTERVENTION IN LIBYA
THOSE COMMENTS ENRAGED DOWNING STREET OF BROUGHT A SWIFT IN TELLING CLARIFICATION FROM THE WHITE HOUSE DAVID CAMERON HAD BEEN AS CLOSE A PARTNER AS THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD THEY SAID
THE PRIME MINISTER WON'T BE COMPLAINING IF THE PRESIDENT USES SOME OF THAT BLUNTNESS TO THEIR VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS

BUT THIS LATEST ACCOUNT IF IT CAN BE VERIFIED IS TRULY SHOCKING FOR THESE SCALE THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY SAYS IT IS TRYING TO VERIFY REPORTS THAT HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS DROWNED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AT THE WEEKEND WHEN THE HUGELY OVERCROWDED BOAT CAPSIZED AND THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR WAY FROM THE HORN OF AFRICA TO ITALY SURVIVORS WERE TAKEN TO GREECE WILL ROSS IS IN GREECE WILL THE FIGURE AT THE MOMENT WE'RE HEARING ANY WAY IS FOUR HUNDRED A CAN CAN YOU VERIFY THAT
AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED THAT'S COMING FROM THE FORTY ONE SURVIVORS WHO ARE NOW HERE IN ATHENS THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY BROUGHT THEM HERE LAST NIGHT JUST THE LATEST STAGE ON THEIR LONG JOURNEY IS THE FLEADH BOTH WORE
AND POVERTY AND OF COURSE THEY JOIN MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE FLED THEIR COUNTRIES HONOUR REALLY TRAPPED NOW HEARING GREECE BECAUSE THE BORDERS ARE CLOSED NOW THE GROUP WE MET INCLUDE SOMALIS EGYPTIANS SUDANESE AND ETHIOPIANS AND THEY SAY THAT SYRIANS WERE ALSO ON THE BOATS THAT WERE LOADED UP IN LIBYA AND ALSO IN IN GREECE NOW WE FOUND THEM IN CALA MATTER THE PORT OF CALA MATTER
AND THIRTY SEVEN MEN THREE WOMEN AND ONE THREE YEAR OLD BOY HE WAS IN THE GROUP AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY LIVING WITNESSES TO YET ANOTHER MASSIVE LOSS OF LIFE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
THE IDYLLIC GREEK PORT TOWN OF COLOUR MATTER HE'S MORE USED TO HOSTING TOURISTS THAN SHIPWRECKED MIGRANTS BUT THIS IS WHERE THE FORTY ONE SURVIVORS WERE BROUGHT ONCE THEY WERE RELEASED THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE TRAGEDY ON THE MEDITERRANEAN
WE HAD A LIFE WITH YOU AND AN OLIVE
IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS WELL OVER FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE DROWNED AND ANOTHER SOMALI ABDUL QADIR SAYS THE NUMBER OF BOARD HAD ALL BEEN COUNTED BEFORE THE WOODEN BOAT CAPSIZED
IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HOURS AFTER THEY'D SET OFF FROM LIBYA AND HE SAYS PEOPLE WERE DROWNING ALL AROUND HIM I SAW MY FRIEND IS A LOT OF FEMINIST SAYING WE NEED THIS THEY WERE SHOUTING FOR HELP FOR HELP THE FORTY ONE WERE LATER RESCUED BY A CARGO SHIP WHEN I MET THEM THEY WERE DESPERATE TO BORROW MY PHONE
OH OR NOT THAT'S LIB AND CALLING HIS MOTHER BACK IN ETHIOPIA AFTER THE CALL HE TELLS ME THAT UNTIL THEN SHE HAD NO IDEA WHETHER HE'D SURVIVED
NEXT TO HIM A YOUNG MAN IN HIS EARLY TWENTIES BROKE DOWN IN TEARS AFTER FINALLY GETTING THROUGH TO HIS MOTHER AND HUGGED AND ROCK HARD THERE BUT THEY ALL SAID THEY WERE DETERMINED TO GET OUT OF GREASE ON TO ITALY AND BEYOND
WE KNOW MANY THOUSANDS MORE ARE TRYING TO GET TO EUROPE BUT HAVING WITNESSED SUCH HORRORS ON THE WAY ABDUL QADIR HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR ANYONE THINKING OF CROSSING THE MEDITERRANEAN
I WOULD SAY DO NOT TRY TO KIM HERE BECAUSE REALLY SAW DANGEROUS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE YOUR ACCOUNT THREE AND YOU HAVE TO STAY
WE'RE ROSS REPORTED THERE ARE JOINED ON THE LINE BY WILLIAMS OF THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU CAN UPDATE THAT FIGURE FOR HIS CANVAS THE SPINDLE OF THE HOUSE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED BUT WILL THE SUGGESTING
WE MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED ON THAT INCIDENT BUT SURVIVORS ARE COMING UP WITH CONSISTENT FEATURES OF AROUND FIVE HUNDRED SO THAT'S THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT WE ARE YOU SEEING AND WHO GETS THE THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST LOSS OF LIFE IN THE MILITARY AND IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS
AND POSSIBLY MANY MANY MORE WHERE THE WENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO SIGN OF THIS EXODUS FROM NORTH AFRICA EASING OFF IS THERE
WELL UNFORTUNATELY NOT CURE AFTER YOU WE SEE TRAGIC SIN COMMITTED TO PREMIUM HAPPENING LAST YEAR OVER THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DROWNED THERE INCLUDING ISLAND CORDY PURSUING TODDLER WHOSE PICTURE MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THIS IS THE DEATH TOLL IS ALREADY OVER TWELVE HUNDRED
WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO TRY TO STOP THEM THEY'VE BEEN ALL SORTS OF PLANS PROPOSED THAT NONE OF THEM SEEMS TO COME TO ANYTHING IT'S NOT AS THOUGH WE'RE TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE COMING FROM TURKEY TO GREECE THAT'S A COMPLETELY SEPARATE OPERATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE COMING FROM COUNTRIES LIKE SOMALIA EGYPT SUDAN ETHIOPIA THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY
THERE'S MORE YOU SEE ANSWER OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO ENSURE GOT HUMAN WRITERS RESPECTED THAT AT THEIR SCOFF ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT IN IN THE PART OF THE WORLD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM BUT WE ALSO NEED TO OFFER THE POSSIBILITY TO THE MOST VULNERABLE REFUGEES TO TRAVEL LEGALLY
AND IN THAT WAY THEY DON'T NEED TO RISK THEIR LIVES IN THIS WAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO COME TO EUROPE HAVE RELATIVES THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO TRAVEL LEGALLY TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES BUT AT THE MOMENT ARE POSSIBLY PIECE A VERY REMOTE AND MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CANNOT WAIT FOR YEARS FOR A PISTOL TO HAPPEN THAT GOING TO BE PICKED HER CHANCES IN THIS WAY AND ISN'T THAT THE REAL DANGER THAT IF
WE HELP SOME TO COME THE MESSAGE WILL GO OUT THAT
IT IS EASY TO GET INTO EUROPE AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENED PERHAPS A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH REFUGEES FROM SYRIA AFGHANISTAN AND SO ON THEN THEY WILL COME PERHAPS IN THEIR MILLIONS
WE THINK IT'S THE OPPOSITE IF WE EXPLAINED TO PEOPLE IF WE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY ONLY TWO GOALS THAT ARE IN NEED THAT NEED RESETTLEMENT IF WE OFFER LEGAL POSSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL SAFELY THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE NOT ENTITLED TO TO TAKE THIS TO INVENTED IN NEED IF YOU WERE LIVING IN

NIKA REPORTING FROM HYDE PARK BARRACKS IT'S NOW TEN TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH US THIS MORNING HERE IN OUR STUDIO IS THE REVEREND LUCY WINK COULD HE WAS THE RECTOR OF SAINT JAMES' PICCADILLY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
MY WHOLE LIFE WHETHER IT BE LONG OR SHORT
ON HER TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY EXACTLY SIXTY NINE YEARS AGO PRINCESS ELIZABETH MADE HER PROMISE ON TELEVISION IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN TO LIVE A LIFE OF SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH NATIONS SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN WHAT LAY AHEAD WHICH CONTINUES TO BE TO THIS DAY A LIFE LIVED AS NO OTHER LIFE IS BEING LIVED ON EARTH
THE QUEEN LIVES ONE OF THE MOST INTERPRETED LIVES ON THE PLANET AND IS THE RECIPIENT OF VARIOUSLY HUGE PROJECTION AFFECTION OBSESSION AND THREAT
THE QUEEN HAS NAVIGATED THE MONARCHY THROUGH DECADES THAT HAVE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED PACE OF CHANGE FROM WORKING IN THE AUXILIARY TERRITORIAL SERVICE DURING THE WAR TO SENDING HER FIRST TWEET IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SHE'S BEEN ACTIVE AND FORMATIVE THROUGH AN AGE IN WHICH AS SHE COMMENTED TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO CHANGE HAS BECOME A CONSTANT
A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCH IS A PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM OF HEREDITARY AUTHORITY THAT'S BECOME BOTH MORE REVERED AND MORE CONTROVERSIAL IN A CENTURY THAT HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH OTHER SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT AND SOMETIMES FOUND THEM WANTING
BUT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A SYSTEM SUPPORTING THE IDEA OF MONARCHY THE RADICAL AND SACRIFICIAL ASPECT OF THIS SYSTEM IS THAT IT REQUIRES AN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING TO ACCEPT AND FIND A WAY TO EMBRACE THE LIFE THAT'S GIVEN TO THEM
TO ACCEPT WITH AS MUCH GRACE AND COURAGE AS THEY CAN MUSTER THE LIFE THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS ASKING THEM TO LIVE AND TO FIND A WAY TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY IN A WAY THAT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM
IT'S A SYSTEM WHICH FUSES THE PERSONAL AND THE POLITICAL IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAY WHICH IS WHY BIRTHDAYS SUCH AS THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH IS A DAY AS SHE SAID IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN NOT ONLY FOR PRIVATE CELEBRATION BUT FOR SERIOUS THOUGHTS
IN A SOCIETY THAT INCREASINGLY OFTEN DEMONSTRATES AN AVERSION TO PERSONAL OR PROFESSIONAL LIFELONG COMMITMENT THE FACT THAT THIS PROMISE MADE HAS BECOME A PROMISE KEPT
HIS COUNTER CULTURAL INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE AND FOR MANY VERY MOVING
I WAS WORKING AT SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL WHEN THE NATIONAL SERVICE TO CELEBRATE THE QUEEN'S GOLDEN JUBILEE WAS HELD IN SHAPING THE SERVICE WE PROPOSE READING ONE OF THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS THAT APPEARS IN ALL THE GOSPELS ONE OF THE GOLDEN THREADS THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT THE NEW TESTAMENT IT'S ADVICE FOR LEADERS
WHOEVER WISHES TO BECOME GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT
TODAY ON THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH BIRTHDAY HER PROMISE TO SERVE IS ALL THE MORE POWERFUL IN RETROSPECT AND NOW AS THEN WERE INVITED TO EMBRACE WITH HER EVERYTHING THAT LIES AHEAD
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND LUCY WINK AT THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE WERE SOME AMAZEMENT WHEN THE NORWEGIAN MASS MURDERER AND AS BRAVE IT WON HIS HUMAN RIGHTS CASE AGAINST THE NORWEGIAN STATE YESTERDAY THE COURT UPHELD HIS CLAIM THAT SOME OF HIS TREATMENT AMOUNTED TO INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OF PUNISHMENT
AFTER THE JUDGEMENT HIS LAWYER CALLED FOR HIS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT TO BE REPEALED BREIVIK YOU'LL REMEMBER AS A RIGHT WING EXTREMIST HE KILLED SIXTY NINE PEOPLE AT A SUMMER CAMP FOR YOUNG CENTRE LEFT POLITICAL ACTIVISTS ON THE ISLAND OF THE TOYAH IN JULY
TWENTY ELEVEN EARLY ON THAT THEY HAD SET OFF A CAR BOMB IN THE NORWEGIAN CAPITAL OSLO THAT CARBON TO ITSELF KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE
BJORN ELA IS ON THE LINE WHO IS A SURVIVOR OF THE PRETORIA ATTACK GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE COURT'S DECISION
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMBALANCED POSITION I THINK IT SHOWS GREAT STRENGTH FROM THE COURT SIDE THAT IS ABLE TO SEE THAT DOMAIN THE FAULTS IN THE WAY IN WHICH THE IMPRISONED SYSTEM HAS TREATED BRICK AND I THINK THAT SHOW JUST HOW FIRMLY IN THEIR COURT BELIEVES IN THE QUALITY BEFORE ALSO WHEN FACING OR WORST TERRORIST
DOESN'T IT ALSO SHOW POTENTIALLY NAIVETY THOUGH BECAUSE THIS IS A MAN WHO WANTS TO SPREAD HIS MESSAGE OF HATE THIS IS THE MAN WHO'S NEVER EXPRESSED ANY SORROW FOR WHAT HE'S DONE HE WANTS WE'RE TOLD HIS GIRLFRIEND A WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE'S HIS GIRLFRIEND TO VISIT HIM IN PRISON NOW AND OTHER WORDS TO BE ABLE TO GET MESSAGES TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD ISN'T IT NAIVE TO ALLOW ALL OF THAT TO HAPPEN
WELL FIRST OF ALL THOUGH THE COURT RULED THOUGH HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEND LETTERS AND COMMUNICATE WITHOUT WORLD HISS
BUT NO LONGER TO BE KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT UNNECESSARILY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE BALANCED AND HOW WE READ THE RULING AS WELL BUT I THINK AT THE OTHER DAY TO SEARCH THE SAME HUMAN RIGHTS AS ANY OTHER INMATES AND I DON'T THINK HE AS A PICCOLO A MUCH LARGER TRUST ANYONE OF THOSE HE BELIEVED AND MANY OF THE SAME THINGS TODAY ELEVENTH OUTSIDE AND SPEAK
HATEFUL MESSAGES FREELY BUT WHAT ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THEIR KIDS AS THEY LARGELY WERE WHO WERE KILLED AND INDEED OF THEIR PARENTS AND RELATIVES WHO HAD TO SEE ALL OF THIS AND WE'LL KNOW NOW IF THE COURT ORDER IS FOLLOWED THAT BRAVE IT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MINGLE WITH OTHER PRISONERS PERHAPS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THEM THAT HE WAS RIGHT DO THEY NOT ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A MAN WHO BEHAVED SO MONSTROUSLY KEPT SEPARATE
WELL OF COURSE BRADY DEAD'S DENY US OR HUMANITY AND OUR HUMAN RIGHTS THAT THIS EVER NOT MAKE IT RIGHT FOR US TO DENY HIM THE SAME THING IF WE DO THAT WE FOLLOW THE SAME LOGIC AS I THINK YOU KNOW AND WE ARE QUICKLY REASONABLE DOESN'T IT FOR US TO TRY TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST HIM HE HAS THE POET IT'S REASONABLE TO TRY TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM HIM AND THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING A TREED CRIMINAL SOMETHING THAT WAS GETTING IN TWENTY TWELVE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS TRIAL NOW WHICH WAS A HEARING ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS IN PRISON UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE HISS
THIS SENTENCE THAT WAS GIVEN TO TOWER TWELVE AND ACCORDING TO THAT SENTENCE IT IS TO BE KEPT ON PRESSING FOR MOST SEVERITY THAT HAS BEEN GETTING IN AND ARE AWAY SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO'VE LOOKED ON THIS PARTICULAR PEOPLE OUTSIDE NORWAY WHO SAY MY GOODNESS THIS IS A STRANGE THING TO DO IT'S A SIGN PERHAPS OF WEAKNESS OR NAIVETY AND A SIGN THAT NORWAY HASN'T BEEN HASN'T TREATED THIS CRIME AS SERIOUSLY AS IT SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT DO YOU SAY
I SAY THAT DE DE SHADES MAYBE RECONSIDER HOW WE TREAT OR ENEMIES ORAL DOSE WE PERCEIVED TO BE EARNED HIM HIS ISLAND SAY THAT OR OR WORSE ON TERRA OR EARLY USE OF VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION TO YOU
REMAIN SAFE SEEMS TO SAIL WE ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER THREAT FROM VARIOUS SOURCES MAYBE IT'S TIME TO RECONSIDER HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT AND MAYBE IN NORWAY CAN BE AN EXAMPLE AND THAT AND THAT WE TREAT FOR US NURSE HUMANELY WITH TREATS THOSE WHO WANT TO DAMAGE HER SOCIETY HUMANELY AND WERE SHOWING THAT HUMANITY WILL SHOW THAT WE'RE ALL EQUAL HUMAN EQUALLY VALUABLE IN MANY WAYS
WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEY'RE BEING PUSHED OUTSIDE OUR SOCIETY'S MAYPOLE STRESS TO OUR SOCIETY'S RIGHT NOW IT MIGHT BE PART OF BUILDING STRONGER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO STAND UP AGAINST EXTREMISM WORK YOUR NAYLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US

N.H.S. LEADERS HOPED THE INVESTMENT WILL EASE THE WORKLOAD OF DOCTORS AND IMPROVE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS THROUGH ONLINE SERVICES AND OUT OF HOURS APPOINTMENTS IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
ENGLAND'S G.P.S' SURGERIES ARE UNDER HUGE PRESSURE WITH PATIENTS FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO GET APPOINTMENTS AND H. S. ENGLAND'S PLAN WILL SEE FURTHER MONEY START GOING TO GENERAL PRACTICE NOW FROM THE EXTRA FUNDS ALREADY PROMISED FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE THE CASH INJECTION WILL STEADILY INCREASE TO EACH TWO POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS BY THE END OF THE DECADE FAMILY DOCTORS SAY THIS IS A VITAL STEP TOWARDS THEIR CALL TO RECEIVE ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE N.H.S. BUDGET
THE HEAD OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF G.P.S DOCTOR MAUREEN BAKER TOLD THIS PROGRAMME WHY THE SUPPORT WAS NEEDED THE PRESSURE AND KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND GIVING THE APPOINTMENTS RUNNING THE SERVICE FOR PATIENTS IN SOME AREAS HAS BECOME ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE AND ACTUALLY G.P. SURGERIES HAVE HAD TO CLOSE A NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE
THE PLAN'S ACKNOWLEDGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOCTORS MAY NEED TO BE RECRUITED FROM OVERSEAS THE MONEY WILL ALSO FUND OTHER STAFF IN SURGERIES INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS AND CLINICAL PHARMACISTS BUT QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT HOW EASILY EXTRA STAFF CAN BE RECRUITED AND WHETHER THE SITUATION WILL IMPROVE QUICKLY ENOUGH

ON DEFENCE THE DEFENCE COMMITTEE SAYS WELL NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN SEVERAL MAJOR EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED ELSEWHERE THE M.O.D. INSISTS IT'S ACCOUNTS FULL FIRMLY WITHIN NATO'S GUIDELINES HERE'S OUR DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN

BUT THEY CONFIRMED THAT ITEMS PREVIOUSLY NOT DEFINED AS DEFENCE SPENDING SUCH AS WAR PENSIONS AND SOME INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ARE NOW BEING INCLUDED TO ACHIEVE THE TWO PER CENT PLEDGE THE DEFENCE COMMITTEE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT COUNTS AS DEFENCE SPENDING AND ALSO HOW IT'LL CONTINUE MEETING THE GOAL IN THE COMING YEARS
THE M.O.D. SAID IT WAS NONSENSE TO SUGGEST THERE WAS NO REAL INCREASING DEFENCE SPENDING WITH AN EXTRA FIVE BILLION POUNDS OVER THE PARLIAMENT

WHEN THE N.H.S. IS IN TROUBLE IT'S ALMOST INVARIABLY HOSPITALS THAT MAKE THE HEADLINES JUNIOR HOSPITAL DOCTORS GOING ON STRIKE CAR PROOF OF THAT BUT MANY ARGUE IT'S G.P.S WHO WERE THE REAL BACKBONE OF THE N.H.S. THERE OUR FIRST POINT OF CONTACT IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS OF COURSE BUT ONLY IF THE SYSTEM IS WORKING PROPERLY IF IT'S NOT THEN THE PRESSURE GROWS ON HOSPITALS OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM STRUGGLES TO COPE WHICH IS WHY THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT G.P.S ARE GOING TO GET A BIGGER SLICE OF THE N.H.S. CAKE IN FUTURE
NOBODY FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR THE N.H.S. WANTED TALK TO US ABOUT IT SO LET'S HEAR FROM SOMEONE AT THE SHARP END DOCTOR COLIN CALLED HARD WHO'S A G.P. IN A PRACTICE IN LONDON AND I'M ALSO JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY ANOTHER DOCTOR NO M. P. DOCTOR SARAH WALLASTON FEATURES THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE DOCTOR CAUGHT UP YOU WERE A PARTNER FULL TIME PARTNER A PART TIME WHY
GOOD MORNING JOHN BUNNY I WAS A FULL TIME PARTNER AND I FELT THAT THE WORKLOAD WAS UNSUSTAINABLE THE STRESS OF SEEING SO MANY PATIENTS AND TALKING TO SO MANY PATIENTS ON A DAILY BASIS JUST MADE ME FATIGUED
AND WHEN I WAS FOR TEA EAT I DIDN'T FEEL THAT I WAS ABLE TO PRACTISE THEIR QUALITY OF MEDICINE BUT I WANTED TO PRACTISE
AND IT TOOK THE JOY OUT OF THE JOB FOR ME WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WELL BUT THAT IS THE JOB YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH BEING A G.P. IN IF YOU COULDN'T STAND THE HEAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GOT THE KITCHEN THE FIRST PLACE YOU SHOULD HAVE REALISED IT WAS A TOUGH JOB
MEDICINE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TOUGH JOB I TRAIN TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST QUALIFIED AS A G.P. WHICH WAS ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO THE JOB THE WORK DEMANDS ON MY TIME DOWN BUT OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE STEADILY GOT WORSE AND WORSE BECAUSE
I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS I THINK THAT WE HAVE AN AGEING POPULATION WHO HAVE MORE COMPLEX HEALTH CARE NEEDS I THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN A TRANSFER OF CARE OF CONDITIONS FROM HOSPITALS TO GENERAL PRACTICE AND NOW WE ARE VERY SHORT OF PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK BUT IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAY I'M GOING TO GO PART TIME THAT ADDS TO THE PROBLEM
IT DOES ADD TO THE PROBLEM BUT IF I DID NOT GO PART TIME I THINK I WOULD'VE MADE MYSELF VERY ILL INDEED AND THEN INSTEAD OF HAVING A PART TIME P. YOU WOULD HAVE HAD NO CHEAPY RED TAPE A BIG FACTOR
I THINK SO THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF THAT I HAVE TO DO FOR MY APPRAISAL AND VALIDATION I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT AS G.P.S WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR KNOWLEDGE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AN UNNECESSARILY BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS TAKING A LOT OF TIME
I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE TARGETS AND STANDARDS THAT ARE IMPOSED ON US FROM OUTSIDE AND THAT STOPS US FROM DOING IN THE CONSULTATION WHAT THE PATIENT WANTS US TO DO WHICH CAUSES US UNDUE STRESS CYRIL'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
I THINK THAT COLIN SET OUT VERY WELL THAT THE PRESSURES THAT ARE FACING GENERAL PRACTICE THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IN A HEALTH COMMITTEE REPORT THAT'S PUBLISHED TODAY AND AND JUST BRING THIS BACK TO PATIENTS WHY IT MATTERS FOR PATIENTS IT'S INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET A TIMELY APPOINTMENT WITH THEIR G.P. AND ALSO CHEAPEST WANT HAS COLIN THE SAID TO PROVIDE LONGER TIME FOR THOSE VERY COMPLICATED PATIENTS THAT THEY AROUND LOOKING AFTER BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT INCREASE IN DEMAND NOT JUST IN NUMBERS
IN THE COMPLEXITY THAT G.P.S HAVE TO THAT WON'T LET ME PUT THE SAME QUESTION HERE THAT I PUT TO DOCTOR CAUGHT OUT ON THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S A TOUGH JOB BUT RELATIVELY WELL REWARDED JOB IF YOU'RE A FULL TIME G.P. IT'S ABOUT NINETY TWO THOUSAND A YEAR THAT'S ROUGHLY THE
BUT THE POINT HE WAS A SAFE JUST TO BRING IT BACK TO PATIENTS AND WHAT PATIENTS NEED IS DOCTORS WHO'VE GOT THE TIME TO CARE AND IT'S THIS REPORT I THINK THAT IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND BECAUSE IT RECOGNISES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE
SO WE NEED TO DO MORE ABOUT NOT JUST RECRUITING MORE G.P.S BUT ALSO RETAINING THEM ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO COME BACK IF THEY'VE ACTUALLY LEFT THE N.H.S. TEMPORARILY AND TO KEEP PEOPLE ON TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR CAREERS AND NOT JUST THAT BUT THE WIDER WORKFORCE HOW DO WE BRING IN MORE MENTAL HEALTH THERAPISTS PHYSIOTHERAPISTS PHARMACIST THAT Y. DE WORKFORCE INCLUDING
ACTORS NURSES THAT ACTUALLY HELPED TO ALLOW PATIENTS TO SEE THE RIGHT PROFESSIONAL AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT I WAS LOOKING AT WHAT ONE OF YOUR FORMER COLLEAGUES HEALTH EDUCATION ENGLAND'S AHEAD COMING SAID NOT SO LONG AGO G.P. RECRUITMENT IS WHAT KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT I MEAN THEY'RE NOT THERE NOW TO BE RECRUITED OTHERS BUT THAT IS WHY THIS REPORT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY SETTING OUT SOME PRACTICAL STEPS ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEAVING THE N.H.S. TO COME BACK INTO THE N.H.S.
AND DO ALL SORTS OF MEASURES THAT ARE SET OUT IN THIS VERY WELCOME REPORTS IT'S ABOUT THE WORKFORCE IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE FACILITIES THAT G.P.S WORK FROM HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE INTO AREAS WHICH ARE UND ADOPTED AREAS WHERE IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD TO RECRUIT SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY WELCOME YOU SAY HARD ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I'VE TOLD HER G.P. I DO QUITE WELL WHO WHO SAID THAT HER PRACTICE THEY'D ADVERTISED FOR
AND MORE G.P. DESPERATELY NEEDED ANOTHER G.P. IDEALLY MORE THAN ONE CAN GET A SINGLE REPLY WHEN THEY ADVERTISE EVERYWHERE INDEED AND WE KNOW THAT EVEN AREAS THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE HAD MANY APPLICATIONS FOR EVERY POSTER NOW FINDING IT DIFFICULT SO WHAT IS THE BIG THING THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BE THAT THE JOB HAS CHANGED AND PATIENCE ARE MORE DEMANDING ALL THE DOCTORS WHAT THINK IT AND MODEL IT IS IT'S FULL UP WITH THAT NO I THINK IT'S A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES IT'S ABOUT THE BUREAUCRACY THAT'S ALSO BEEN PILED ON TO G.P.S MANY TASKS
SHIFTING FROM HOSPITAL INTO PRIMARY CARE BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS HAVE A POSITIVE APPROACH ONE THEY'LL DONE AFFINITIES PROBLEMS AT THAT DRESS BUT NO I MEAN PEOPLE UNDER THEY CAN KNOW THAT EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT THIS REPORT FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND DOES TODAY ACTUALLY SETS OUT HER OH SOME PRACTICAL MEASURES THAT CAN HELP TO REVERSE THAT HOW DO WE FIRST OF ALL START FROM THE WORKFORCE HOW CAN WE GET THE WORKFORCE WE NEED NOT NOT TO
NOT BECAUSE OF G.P.S BUT BECAUSE OF PATIENTS WHAT PATIENTS NEED SO THAT THERE IS THAT RIGHT PROFESSIONALS WITH THE MORE TIME TO GIVE THEM THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT A PRACTICAL STEPS THAT CAN ACTUALLY CENTRES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND A LOT OF THAT OF COURSE HE'S COME DOWN TO FINANCE WE HAVE SEEN THEIR SHARE OF FUNDING FROM THE N.H.S.
BUDGET THAT'S GONE TO GENERAL PRACTICE SHRINKING OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S NOW STARTING TO PUT THAT BACK TO OUR PROBLEM HERE DON'T YOU BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF EMAILS THIS MORNING FROM PEOPLE SAME G.P.S ARE PAID TOO MUCH AS IT'S DOWN
WELL I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND GET AWAY FROM THAT IT'S PURE CURIOUS OF FUNDING TO SAY IT'S IT'S A FIT FOR G.P.S SALARIES AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE WIDER WORKFORCE WHAT CAN WE DO YOU MUST BE GREAT YOU SALARIES BECAUSE OF THE MONEY IS GOING TO G.P.S NOT GOING FROM BRISTOL TO BE FAIR THE EVIDENCE WE HEARD DURING OUR INQUIRY IS THAT THEIR INCOMES WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN DECLINING FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS SO I THINK THAT
THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE OF THIS VERY OVERPAID WORK WAS HIS I THINK ISN'T THE EVIDENCE WE WERE HEARING IN THE COURSE OF OUR ENQUIRY BUT A SAY WHAT WE MUST DO IS BRING THIS BACK TO PATIENTS AND FOCUS ON THE WORKFORCE ON THE PREMISES SO WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT FACILITIES AND PREMISES BETTER USE OF OF TECHNOLOGY
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TRANSFORM PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE OF PRIMARY CARE COS THAT'S WHAT MAX BUT HOW WERE YOU GOING TO PERSUADE DOCTORS WHO MIGHT WELL FEEL WORKING IN A HOSPITAL IS MORE GLAMOROUS OR WHATEVER COURSE AT SOMETHING WE ADDRESSED IN OUR REPORT AND AND IN THIS REPORT FROM N.H.S. ENGLAND IS A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU EXPOSE MORE PEOPLE TO PRIMARY CARE DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR TRAINING AND NOT JUST DOCTORS BUT NURSES AS WELL SO THAT WE HAVE JUNIOR DOCTORS RIGHT FROM RECRUITMENT OMITTED TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND DID TO TRAIN AS NURSES
RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THEIR TRAINING THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVING EXPERIENCE IN PRIMARY CARE SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT A FANTASTIC JOB IT IS COS I STILL FEEL IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL JOB IS PART OF THE ANSWER TRYING TO RECRUIT FROM OVERSEAS TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE FROM OVERSEAS HAVE KNOWS ARE QUITE A FEW HERE THEY CERTAINLY TOUCH ON THAT IN THE REPORT THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THERE WILL BE A RECRUITMENT DRIVE BUT IT'S ALSO ENCOURAGING DOCTORS THAT HAVE TRAINED IN THE U.K. TO COME BACK FROM ABROAD BECAUSE WE WERE PUTTING ALL SORTS OF UNNECESSARY HURDLES IN THE WAY FOR THEM TO RETURN HERE CERTAINLY I HEARD EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT DURING THE
IN THE COURSE OF ENQUIRY RECEIVED EVIDENCE FROM PEOPLE SAYING HOW HOW SOMETIMES IT WAS UNNECESSARILY DIFFICULT TO RETURN AND THAT'S ADDRESSED IN THIS REPORT WHICH IS VERY WELL SOMETHING'S GONE FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG HASN'T IT I MEAN ALL THOSE DETAILS THAT YOU DESCRIBE ARE FINE BUT THERE WAS A TIME NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO WHERE G.P.S WERE REGARDED
ALMOST I DON'T THINK I'M EXAGGERATING HERE ALMOST GODLIKE FIGURES WE HELD HIM IN HUGE RESPECT WE DIDN'T SAY ALL THEIR OWN INCOME WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT CHANGED ALL THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NEW G.P. CONTRACT THAT WAS HUGELY UNPOPULAR WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE IT MIGHT A BIT WHATEVER WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS AND IF WE CAN ADDRESS THAT THERE MAYBE HOLDING RIGHT AGAIN I THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IT WAS HER
A HUGE CHANGE IN DEMAND I TELL YOU WHEN I SAID I DEMAND DEMAND AND ALSO THE THE HOURS THAT DOCTORS WORK WHEN I STARTED IN PRACTICE I I WAS WORKING SEVENTY TWO HOUR SHIFTS ON CALL ACROSS RURAL DARTMOOR AND THAT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE I THINK SOMETHING DID HAVE TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS IN THE PAST PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE PHONED THE DOCTOR IT IF THEY HAD A REALLY SERIOUS EMERGENCY BUT PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF ACCESSING CARE CHANGE TO THE WAY THAT IT HAD TO BE DELIVERED SOMETHING HAD TO GIVE
SO I THINK WE CAN RE RE HASH ALL THAT OLD GROUND AND I THINK THEY'VE BEEN RIGHTLY SOME CRITICISMS OF OF REMOVING THAT THAT SORT OF VERY PERSONAL CONTINUITY OF CARE THAT PEOPLE VALUED BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP ON THAT A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT CONTINUITY OF CARE BUT GIVING DOCTORS THERE TIME TO PROVIDE THE CARE PATIENTS NEED THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS SARAH WALLASTON CHRONICLED HER THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS TWENTY PAST EIGHT NOW ART IS MEANT TO BE CHALLENGING DISCOMFORTING EVEN HE'S NOT ACTUALLY MEANT TO DO YOU HARM WHEN YOU ARE THE AUDIENCE FOR THAT ART DAMIEN HIRST ANIMALS PRESERVED IN FORMALDEHYDE WAS CERTAINLY CHALLENGING THE HUGE METAL TANKS THE ICONIC WORKS WON HIM THE TURNER PRIZE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THIS SOLD FOR MILLIONS OF POUND BUT IT'S A MERGED
THEY'VE BEEN LEAKING HAZARDOUS GASES ARE AND IS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS GASES IN PUBLIC ART GANNETS WILL ARE ARTS EDITOR IS HERE WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WELL THERE IS A STORY THAT DAMIEN HIRST'S ART WORKS WHICH IS
DEAD ANIMALS IN FROM OTHER HIDE IN THESE GLASS CASES HAVE BEEN LEAKING NOXIOUS FUMES THROUGH THE SEAMS AND SOME SCIENTISTS WENT ALONG TO HIS RETROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION AT TATE IN TWENTY TWELVE UNDERCOVER AND USE THEIR GEIGER COUNTERS WHATEVER THE HUGH THING TO DISCOVER THAT THERE ARE MORE PARTICLES GOING INTO THE AIR THAT WERE GOOD WITH THE ROOTS GOOD FIT FOR THE PEOPLE THEY THEY
HASTEN TO ADD THAT IF YOU WERE JUST A VISITOR TO THE EXHIBITION AND YOU'LL BE FINE BUT FOR THE GALLERY ASSISTANTS WHO WERE IN THERE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS A DAY THEY MIGHT COME TO SOME HARM WHICH IT WHICH ACTUALLY IT'S A POTENTIALLY QUITE A SERIOUS THING WHEN IT'S NOT GREAT IS IT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BEING EXPOSED TO CARCINOGENIC FUMES FOR HOURS ON END AND THE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING ALLEGING THAT THEY COULD CAUSE GREAT HARM I SHOULD SAY COULD I MEAN
IT'S NOT NEWS IN A WAY THAT DAMIEN HIRST'S ARTWORK TO DISINTEGRATE AND LEEK THIS IS THE STORY BEEN GOING AROUND SINCE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND I THINK HE'S SHOT FAMOUS HAD DISINTEGRATED THE ONE OWNED BY THE AMERICAN COLLECTOR COHEN AND AND HAD TO BE REMADE IN THE NEW SHOT WENT WENT INTO IT BUT I THINK THERE IS A BROADER THING THAT PEOPLE THINK I SUPPOSE WITH WITH ART OF ALL TYPES AND PARTICULAR CONTEMPORARY ART THAT IT IS IT'S SAFE AND SECURE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MADE OUT OF TYPICALLY ORGANIC MATERIALS AND ORGANIC MATERIALS
REACTOR AND CHANGING IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS I REMEMBER AT EIGHTEEN WHEN I REMEMBER THE CHINESE ARTIST FILLED THE TURBINE HALL WITH SUNFLOWER SEEDS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE INVITED TO TRAMPLE UPON THOSE SEEDS
AND THEN WITHIN TWO DAYS THE EXHIBITION WAS WAS CLOSED PEOPLE WALKING ON IT YOU COULD JUST VIEW IT BECAUSE IT'S THROWING UP LOTS OF DUST AND THAT DUST WAS ABSOLUTELY FULL OF LEAD JUST VERY BRIEFLY WELL OF THE TATE SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS WAS HIS POTENTIALLY QUITE SIEVE THIS IS CARCINOGENIC AND THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR QUITE LONG PERIODS WHAT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO THEY ARE SAYING QUITE RIGHTLY THAT THEY TAKE THE HEALTH OF THEIR STAFF AND THEIR VISITORS INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS
THESE FUMES WERE POTENTIALLY IN FINDING OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE CHECKING OUT THE SCIENCE THEMSELVES AND THEY WILL TAKE I SUPPOSE TO DO THE NECESSARY COURSE OF ACTION BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS JUSTIN IF YOU ARE HAVING SOMETHING IN IN A GALLERY WHICH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VIEWING QUITE CLOSE UP AND YOU KNOW THAT IT CONTAINS
TRICKY MATERIALS AND FOR MEL THE HIDE OF COURSE IS A TRICKY MATERIAL DID THEY DO ENOUGH WORK TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE COMFORTABLE NO FUMES COULD POSSIBLY BE AMISS I COME IT COMING OUT OF THE SEAMS OF THOSE ART WORKS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND WE HAVE A CORRECTION TO MAKE A VERY SERIOUS CORRECTION
YES I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS OTHERWISE ENTIRELY ESTIMABLE PETER HUNT OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT WAS TALKING TO JUSTIN
WE DIDN'T GET THAT CLOSE UNFORTUNATELY PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WE ARE HE TALKED ABOUT THE QUEEN BEING BORN AT A TIME WHEN A PINT OF MILK COST HE SAID ONE PENCE NOW YOU DEAR AUDIENCE WENT BALLISTIC QUITE RIGHTLY ONE PENNY PLEASE THEY SAID
IN UNISON AND ALSO THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER IT WAS OLD OR A NEW ONE AND OF COURSE IT WAS AN OLD ONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OLD PENNY WOULDN'T IT WHICH WAS EVEN LESS THAN A PENNY TODAY IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN THERE'S THE QUEEN ALF CALLED

COMMENTATOR IAN BROWN WAS AT ANFIELD LAST NIGHT A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU IAN HOW BAD WAS THE RED CARD
PRETTY BAD I WOULD SAY IF YOU GIFFEN HE'S MORE HE'S JUST A SMALL BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT YOU COULD SAY IT WASN'T PRE MEDITATED BUT IT WAS RECKLESS AT BEST NO CONCERN AT ALL FOR WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN TO HIS OPPONENT A REEDY WE'RE TOLD HASN'T BROKEN ANYTHING BUT IT COULD BE CALL LIGAMENT DAMAGE AND WHAT WAS WORSE REALLY AND SOME WAS MORI AFTER HE HAD BEEN SENT OFF
HOLLERING AT THE EVERTON BADGE ON HIS SHIRT AS IF BEING SENT OFF AND COMMITTING THAT HORRENDOUS FOUL WAS SOME KIND OF TRIBAL ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS NOT VERY TASTEFUL AND WHEN IT COMES TO EVERTON THEY ARE CURRENTLY ELEVENTH IN THE LEAGUE HE DOESN'T SOUND TOO BAD BUT ROBERTO MARTINEZ HE'S UNDER HUGE PRESSURE NOW CAN HE HOLD ONTO HIS JOB IT'S THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE TABLE THEY'VE GOT A GOOD SQUAD THERE SHOULDN'T BE IN THAT POSITION EX EVERTON PLAYERS HAVE BEEN QUEUING UP
TO CONDEMN THE SHAMBOLIC NATURE OF EVERTON'S PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT THEY WERE TWO DOWN REMEMBER BEFORE THE SENDING OFF THEY COULD HAVE LOST BY EIGHT MARTIN HAS USED THE WORD HORRIBLE SEVERAL TIMES HE'S FEELING THE HEAT THEY'VE GOT THE CUP SEMI FINAL COMING UP AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED ON SATURDAY IT'S ALMOST WIN OR BUST FOR MARTIN AS YOU FEEL AND THERE HAVE BEEN BORED CHANGES RECENTLY AT EVERTON THE DYNAMIC HAS CHANGED BEHIND THE SCENES AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE WORKING IN HIS FAVOUR

TO MAKE THE GAME KEEP PACE WITH THE MODERN WORLD DO THE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO PERSUADE MORE PEOPLE TO WATCH MORE PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN PLAYING MORE PEOPLE JUST HAVE A KIND OF SENSE OF THEMSELVES AS RUGBY LEAGUE I THINK RUGBY LEAGUE PARTICIPATION LEVELS ARE UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ANOTHER LONDON BRONCOS AREN'T THE TOP ECHELONS OF THE GAME ANY MORE
BUT PARTICIPATION AT GRASSROOTS LEVEL IS GREISER RISING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THEY KNOW THE VIEWING FIGURES ON SKY PARTICULARLY ARE ALSO GREAT AND AS I SAY IT THE SPORT ISN'T IT IN A VIBRANT STATE

PEOPLE IS NORTH WEST BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS MORNING CHAIR OF THE ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY RUGBY LEAGUE GROUP MORNING
GREAT THIS IS A BIG DEAL ISN'T IT AND WE WERE TALKING AND MARTIN A FIRE ABOUT A HOW LEAGUE FORCES ITSELF ONTO THE ATTENTION
OF MORE PEOPLE AND BECOMES A BIGGER SPORT AND IT FEELS ITSELF DOESN'T IT TO BE UNDER PRESSURE TO DO THAT GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED TO RUGBY UNION IN THE LAST SORT OF DECADENCE
I THINK ALL SPORTS ARE UNDER PRESSURE AND I THINK RUGBY LEAGUE SHOULD DEFINED ITSELF BY ANY OTHER SPORT IT SHOULD BE A PROUD SPORT AND IT'S FANTASTIC TO HAVE THIS TODAY AND THANK YOU TO THIS STAY PROGRAMME POSTINGS WERE EXCITING AND SOME SOME GREAT TIMES THERE GREATS HAVE MARTIN IN THE STUDIO DO YOU FEEL THAT LEAGUE
HAS DONE ITSELF JUSTICE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF PUNCHING IT'S WAITER I SUPPOSE AND IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OR DO YOU FIT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT LEAGUE IS HE'S NOT TAKEN AS SERIOUSLY AS IT SHOULD BE
WELL IT DEPENDS WHERE YOU ARE I REPRESENT LEADS OBVIOUSLY HAD AN INCREDIBLE SEASON LAST YEAR AND JUST WONDERFUL SPORTING SPECTACLE FOR ANY ANY SPORTS FUN BUT CLEARLY IT DOESN'T HAVE A SUPER LEAGUE CLUB IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS AN ISSUE BUT THERE ARE NOW SEMI PROFESSIONAL CLUBS IN AREAS LIKE GLOUCESTER OXFORD HAVE SO IT'S EXPANDING BUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AND I THINK IT'S GREAT WHEN THE NATIONAL LONDON BASED MEDIA AS WELL AS THE SALFORD NATIONAL MEDIA THE B. B. C.
UP THERE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AS THERE WAS A PEN LOVE SCHOOLS ISN'T IT WHEN YOU THINK OF ALL THE WORRIES ABOUT SCRUMMAGING AND THE POTENTIAL THREAT FOR KENT INJURING THEMSELVES BADLY WOULD YOU SEE SCHOOL RUGBY AS A PLACE WHERE ONLY CAN NOW RUGBY LEAGUE CAN THAT REALLY EXPAND
I THINK SO IT WAS INTERESTING WE SAW A SOUTHERN SCHOOL WIN AT WEMBLEY A FEW YEARS AGO SO THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS OF EXPANSION BUT SO IS WOMEN'S RUGBY LEAGUE IS IS EXPANDING SO HE'S TAGGED TRI TAG RUGBY BECOMING VERY VERY POPULAR AS A WAY TO GET FIT WITHOUT THE CONTACT WELCOME AS WELL WHICH IS THE OVER THIRTY FIVES VERSION OF THE GAME I JUST WONDER WHAT YOU'D SAY GO WITH TOOK TO THOSE PEOPLE SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE RUGBY UNLESS YOU HAVE SCRUMS THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE END
WELL I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO TO BE BANNING SCRUMS CLEARLY BOTH CODES HAVE TO TAKE THE SAFETY ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY I THINK RUGBY LEAGUE DOES DO THAT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAT TO TAKE TO TEACH SAFE TACKLING AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKED AFTER BUT IT'S A CONTACT GAME AND THAT'S FRANKLY WHY WE WHY WE ENJOY IT THOUGH THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF IT NON CONTACT WHEELCHAIR EXCEPT WITH ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY
RUGBY LEAGUE OF COURSE YOU TWO MIGHT EVEN FANCY GAME OF BOTH THIRTY FIVE'S MUSTARD I HAVE A PAIR OF FOR YOU HERE I'VE GOT IT I'VE GOT A PAIR OF THE GOLD SHORTS FOR YOU SO READ SURE I READ I THOUGHT OF PLAYING ANY KIND OF CONTACT SPORT WITH JOHN HAS MADE ME FEEL QUITE SICK INSIDE ACTUALLY GUILT GREG MULHOLLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINETEEN MINUTES

THE PRINCE OF WALES THERE SHE IS THE BEST KNOWN OBVIOUSLY AND THE LEAST KNOWN OF FAMOUS FACES BECAUSE PERHAPS ALTHOUGH SHE IS THE MOST FAMOUS MAYBE THE MOST ENDURING FACING THE WORLD SHE DOESN'T GIVE INTERVIEWS AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAS MET AND CHATTED TO A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE GET PRECIOUS FEW INSIGHTS INTO WHAT SHE'S REALLY LIKE WHICH DOESN'T STOP US TRYING OF COURSE STILL TO SUMMON PRETTY FAMOUS HIMSELF AND HE'S META OFFERED ROGER MOORE SIR ROGER MOORE

SHE IS ADORABLE
IF I CAN SAY THAT ABOUT HER MAJESTY'S SHOES THOUGH ONE OF THE MOST CALM BEAUTIFUL LATER GOOSE ONE CAN EVER COME ACROSS
THERE WAS I HAD ONE OPPORTUNITY ASSISTING
WHEN SHE PULLED THE CORD OUT OF LONDON HEATHROW
WHEN WE WERE SMALLER BREDRIN UNICEF'S ALLIANCE WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS WILL CHANGE FOR GOOD
SHE PULLED THE CORD THE CURTAIN DIDN'T OPEN I LEAPT ACROSS THE STAGE LIKE A PROPER BOND AND RELEASED IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS LOOK AT THE OTHER WORKER SIX WHO WHIRRING AND MARK SENT ME A THANK YOU
MUM THIS PLAQUE IT IS ALWAYS SAID OF HER THAT SHE REALLY DOES HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND OFTEN WERE OF COURSE ONE WONDERS WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO IMPRESSED BY THE BUBBLES ANYTHING SHE DOES YOU SAY MY WORD BUT THE FACT IS SHE DOES ENJOY A GOOD JOKE DOESN'T SHE
I'M QUITE SURE SHE DOES BUT WHAT WHEN THEY DO REMEMBER ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT OF MY LIFE APART FROM MARRIAGE AND CHILDREN
ROSE OOP BIT WHEN BEING DOGGED WITH THE SWORD REIMBURSE SURE WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT WHETHER I'M SUCH A COWARD THAT I SHUT MY EYES CLOSE AND SWORD WAS LIFTED THAT'S RIGHT I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE IT HAPPENING IS IS SHE A BOND FAN DO YOU KNOW THOSE SHOES AWARE OF THE BOMBS
YEAH WELL SHE CERTAINLY IS BECAUSE SHE SORT OF PLAYED THAT VITAL ROLE DIDN'T SHE YES I'VE NEVER BEEN JEALOUS REALLY OF ANY OTHER ACTOR IN MY LIFE BUT I AM JEALOUS OF DANIEL CRAIG FOR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE BUT HELICOPTER AND WALKED ON A CORRIDOR IN THE PALACE
YES THAT WAS QUITE THAT WAS QUITE A MOMENT WE DIDN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT WHEN WE SAW HOW SNOGGING WHO IT WAS IT WAS A DOUBLE THAT ALL GRATED IT WASN'T A DOUBLE AT ALL SO SO IS THAT YOUR BEST MOMENT MEMORY OF HER OWN OR WILL BORE HIM FACT ARE YOU PERHAPS THE OPPOSITE OF THE BEST MOMENT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU CRINGE A BIT I DON'T KNOW
I THINK MY MUM WAS A BEING WITH HER OWN SINCE HER CORONATION OATS
IT'S BECOME HIS MOST IMPORTANT MY FAMILY AT THE QUEEN'S SPEECH ON THE TELECAST ON CHRISTMAS I'M INHERIT A LITTLE MY GRANDFATHER WHO WAS A SENIOR IN THE BRITISH ARMY IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR WAS LIKELY TO CLIP ANYBODY AROUND HERE IF THEY DIDN'T GET UP RATHER SMARTLY IN THE CINEMA WHEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM WAS PLAYING NO I THINK YOU'RE A NATURAL AREN'T THEM IS ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID BECAUSE
NO IT WAS A PRAYER WE SAY GOD SAVE OUR GRACIOUS QUEEN AND SHE CERTAINLY IS GRACIOUS AND
WE DO BECAUSE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER TEN YEARS SO I MIGHT WRITE HER A LETTER ON HER HUNDREDTH BIRTHDAY WE MIGHT SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN THEN ROGER MOORE SIR ROGER MOORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLEASURE AT THE TIME TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE SHOULD MCDONALD'S HAVE A STAND AT THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE IN THE AUTUMN MCDONNELL'S DOESN'T RECOGNISE UNIONS AND IS ACCUSED OF PAYING PEOPLE PAUL IS A MATTER OF COMPANY POLICY ON THE OTHER HAND
IT'S A PLACE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE LABOUR PEOPLE CHOOSE TO EAT AND THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY THIRTY THOUSAND QUID WE'RE HERE TO HAVE THEIR STAND AT THE CONFERENCE THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE THE LABOUR PARTY HAS SAID NO SOME LABOUR M.P.S ARE UNHAPPY IAN HODSON IS HERE IS THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE BAKERS FOOD AND ALLIED WORKERS UNION AND JOHN MANN IS HERE AS WELL LABOUR M.P. WHO IS ONE OF THOSE WHO IS UNHAPPY MORNING TO BUY IAN HODGSON FIRST OF ALL THE CASE AGAINST MCDONALD'S THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE AT THE CONFERENCE
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LABOUR PARTY DECISION TO WEAR TO EXCLUDE MCDONNELL'S I THINK THAT IF THEY HAD MADE ANY OTHER DECISION IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS QUITE HYPOCRITICAL I MEAN WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS THAT OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE OF TAX
AND TAX AVOIDANCE AND TAX HAVENS HAS BEEN HIGH ON ON PUT POLITICAL AGENDA AND HIS MCDONNELL'S WHO ER COMMONLY THERE'S BEEN INVESTIGATED ACROSS ACROSS THE WORLD THAT ISSUES AROUND TAX I MEAN LABOUR PARTY CAMPAIGNED IN THE GENERAL ELECTION AROUND ISSUES OF ZERO HOUR CONTRACTS
AND SO AGAIN YOU KNOW THE PIONEERS OF ZERO WERE CONTRACTS A MCDONALD'S SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE INTO CONSIDERATION AND I THINK FOR FOR A POLITICAL PARTY TO MAKE THAT BRAVE STEP
IN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PUTTING FORWARD THAT THEY WOULD BE PREPARED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS ISSUE IN SUCH A WAY WHICH COULD HELP THOSE WORKERS IN IN MCDONALD'S I THINK IS IT'S A MASSIVE BENEFIT JOHN MAN JUST PUTTING YOUR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS RENT WHAT IT HELPS NO WORKERS IN MCDONALD'S HIS GESTURES ARE INEFFECTIVE
FAR BETTER TO BE ENGAGING THESE COMPANIES AND THAT'S NOW A MISSED OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN LIVERPOOL IT WON'T BE DONE COST A LOT BE THERE AND YOU IAN AND HIS UNION STAY IN HOTELS AT THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE THAT ARE NON UNIONISED
GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE COME TO THESE CONFERENCES AND WE SHOULD BE ENGAGING WITH LITTLE DIFFERENT THOSE STONE AN ONION A NICE HOTEL AND ACTUALLY HAVING AS A GUEST AT YOUR CONFERENCE I NEED DIE TAKING MONEY FROM AN ORGANISATION WHOSE WORKING PRACTICES YOU TO CRY WHO HAVE ALL SORTS OF COMPANIES WHO COME TO THE CONFERENCE AND IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THEM BANNING PEOPLE
DOESN'T DO A SINGLE THING FOR ANY OF THE WORKERS IN MCDONALD'S IN MY CONSTITUENCY OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS ENGAGING AND GOOD LUCK IF HE AND HIS UNION CAN RECRUIT PEOPLE A MCDONALD'S
THAT'D BE A GOOD THING FOR THOSE WORKERS THESE GESTURES DON'T WORK PEOPLE COULD HAVE GONE TO THE STAND CAN THEY ENHANCE AND HAD ABOUT WITH THE MACDONALDS PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SHE COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE A GOOD PUBLICITY WIN FOR THE PARTY AND FOR YOUR CAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY PEOPLE FROM THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT MCDONALD'S I THINK PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW EMPLOYED AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMPANY TO TO PUSH FORWARD WHATEVER THEIR AGENDA WAS I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY PART OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM WHATSOEVER I MEAN WE ARE WE'VE WROTE TO MCDONALD'S YOU HAVE ATTENDED HAVENS WHERE MCDONNELL'S HAVE BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK A NUMBER YET TO MEET
ANYBODY FROM THE MANAGEMENT TEAM ANY OF THOSE EVENTS I THINK IT WAS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO MCDONALD'S I'M SURE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM MCDONNELL'S ABOUT WHY THEY THINK IT'S SUCH A GOOD THING TO DO
TWO WERE OPERATE ZERO HOURS CONTRACTS AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE AMOUNTS OF MONEY THEY'VE HAD OUT OF BRITISH TAX PAYER WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN REAL ENGAGEMENT JOHN MAN THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN PEOPLE ARE JUST PAID TO BE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK PROPERLY FOR THE COMPANY AND ACTUALLY THEY WOULD HAVE
THEY WOULD HAVE JUST GOT AWAY WITH BEING THERE AND DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD BUT NOT OF THE DISEASE LITTLE GESTURES THEY DO NOTHING IT HAVE ENGAGE WITH MCDONNELL'S GONE INTO THE MCDONALD'S CHAINS I'VE SPOKEN TO THE WORKFORCE
RECOMMENDED ON THE JOHN A UNION THAT KIND OF ENGAGEMENT IS POSITIVE IT'S GOOD THE LAST THING WE WANT IS THE LABOUR PARTY GONE BACK TO INEFFECTIVE GESTURE POLITICS GESTURES DON'T WORK EFFECTIVE ACTION WORKS HE'S ACTUALLY COUNTED AND WHOLE ETHOS
OF THE TRADE UNIONS GOOD TRADE UNION ORGANISATION IS HOW WE GET PEOPLE IN THE TRADE UNIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY SHIED AWAY FROM GESTURE POLITICS AND IT'S BAD TO SEE THIS COMING BACK WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TELLS US WHAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT IT TELLS US ABOUT
YOU THINK THE LABOUR PARTY NOW STANDS FOR AND IS THE WIDER SENSE WELL I MEAN I'M TALKING TO WATCH HER WORKERS HAVE BUT TUNNELS WE HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS ACROSS MCDONNELL'S WE HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN REPRESENTING US AT THE EUROPEAN UNION TALKING ABOUT THE PRACTICES THAT MCDONALD'S PARTAKING THEY'RE SAYING TO US
BUT THEY BELIEVED THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD CONFIDENCE TO A POLITICAL PARTY REPRESENTS THEM WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY HERE BEING A POLITICAL PARTY PUT IN THEM BEFORE THE BIG GIANT CO OPERATION BECAUSE IT HAS THE BIG BOOKS BEHIND IT AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITE POSITIVE
ON HEARING THIS MESSAGE FROM FROM A POLITICAL PARTY IN A LOT OF MEMBERS WHICH A MAN MIGHT BE SAYING LOOK THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT ACTUALLY MADE YOU'D CALL IT A GESTURE ACTUALLY THEY WANT THE LABOUR PARTY TO STAND FOR THINGS AND TO BE VERY CLEAR
BUT IT'S NOT WILLING JUST TO KIND OF COMPROMISE IN A MISSION MASHY WAY WITH WITH ORGANISATIONS OF WHICH IT DISAPPROVES AND HERE WE ARE MCDONALD'S IS TOP OF THE LIST WAS VAST NUMBERS OF COMPANIES OUT THERE WELL MAYBE THEY'LL ALL GO ON THE LIST AS WELL AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE DO YOU END THE LIST CAN GET ON AND ON AND ON ENGAGEMENT WORKS POLITICAL PARTY SHOULD BE ENGAGING THE WORKERS WHO WERE IN MCDONALD'S IN MY AREA THEY WANT THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE GETTING PAID
THE PEOPLE WHO GO ON BY THE MCDONALD'S BURGERS THEY'RE CHOOSING TO DO SO WE NEED TO BE ENGAGING WITH ALL OF THEM GESTURES HAVE NEVER WORKED EFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT WORKS AND THE LABOUR PARTY IF HE'S GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY THE MESSAGE OUT ABOUT MEAN SERIOUS NEEDS TO BE ENGAGING EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT INCLUDES BIG EMPLOYERS LIKE MCDONALD'S WITH SIXTY THOUSAND WORKERS ALL RIGHT JOHN MANN IN HUTS IN AS WELL THANKS BOTH ENDS
TO NINE A COMMITTEE OF M. PIECES MADE A SERIOUS ALLEGATION ABOUT THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT AS HANDLE DEFENCE SPENDING IT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE NATO SPENDING TARGET ONLY BY MODIFYING THE M.O.D. ACCOUNTS WHERE I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR JULIAN LEWIS CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE MODIFYING DOES THAT MEAN FIDDLING NO IT DOESN'T MEAN FIDDLING BECAUSE NO RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN AT ANY STAGE AND WE'RE QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THIS WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT WE ARE NOW COUNTING
AS PART OF OUR TOTAL TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH THE PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT SPENT ON DUFFY IT'S MEANT TO BE TWO PER CENT THAT IS WELL THAT HAS BECOME A BIT OF A MYTH I MEAN IT IS A COMMITMENT TO SPEND AT LEAST TWO PERCENT AND NEVER IN OUR HISTORY HAVE WE BEEN IN DANGER PRIOR TO THIS LAST ITERATION OF DROPPING BELOW TWO PER CENT SO WHAT HAPPENED IS
THAT AND THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO WITH OUR REPORT WE WANTED TO CALCULATE WHAT DEFENCE EXPENDITURE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF G.D.P. IF THEY HAD APPLIED THE SAME CRITERIA THAT THEY APPLIED FIVE YEARS PREVIOUSLY AND THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO IS AN ESTIMATE
DRAWN ON THE TESTIMONY OF EXPERTS IN THE FIELD THAT IT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY COME IN SLIGHTLY BELOW THE TWO PER CENT BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO SET THE THING IN ITS WIDER HISTORICAL CONTEXT WHERE TWO PER CENT WOULD IT WOULD SUGGEST IN THE PRESENT SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING PERHAPS THE REASON WHY THEY HAVEN'T HIT EVEN THAT TWO PERCENT IS THAT THEY'RE INCLUDING THINGS LIKE WAR PENSIONS AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IN THE SUMS
YES I I MEAN THE SOME OF THE MONEY FOR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IS CLEARLY KNEW MONEY THERE'S A NEW FUND IF I THINK ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF WHICH DEFENCE WILL BE ABLE TO BEAT FORMER PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS AND THAT IS AT LEAST NEW MONEY BUT WHEN THEY START INCLUDING WAR PENSIONS AND THE PENSIONS OF RETIRED M.O.D. CIVIL SERVANT
EVEN THOUGH NATO GUIDELINES ALLOW THEM TO DO IT ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THEY SHOULD HAVE FLAG THAT UP SAYING THIS IS A CATEGORY OF EXPENDITURE THAT WE CHOSE NOT TO INCLUDE IN THE PAST BUT WE'RE NOW FRANKLY TRYING TO AMASS EVERY LITTLE BIT THAT WE CAN IN ORDER TO SCRAPE OVER AT THE TWO PER CENT THRESHOLD DOCTOR GILLIAN LEWIS CHAIR OF THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
