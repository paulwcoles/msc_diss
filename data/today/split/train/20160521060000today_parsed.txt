BREAKS IT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DISMISSED GEORGE OSBORNE'S CLAIM THAT HOUSE PRICES WOULD FALL SIGNIFICANTLY IT BRITAIN LEFT THE E.U. AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE NON SMOKER WHO TOOK A BE CIGARETTES BEEPING TO SEE WHAT IT DID TO HIS BODY THE AUTHOR JONATHAN COE ON HIS ELEVENTH NOVEL ENTITLED SIMPLY NUMBER ELEVEN AND WILL ROAD TEST THE LATEST IN SMART DEVICES BUT THAT'S YOU BACK
SIR TELL ME A JOKE WHAT DO YOU CALL AN AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY MADRAS CARTOONS YANKEE DOODLE TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS KATHY CLARKSTON IT'S EMERGED THAT CENTRES ON THE EGYPTIAN AIRLINER WHICH CRASHED IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HER DETECTED PROBLEMS WITH THE FLIGHT CONTROL COMPUTER SHORTLY BEFORE THE PLANE DISAPPEARED ALL SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD WHO WERE FLYING FROM PARIS TO CAIRO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED HERE'S ADAM PORTER
JUST MINUTES BEFORE FLIGHT M.S. SATO FOR DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR SCREENS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THURSDAY MORNING THE AIRBUS A. THREE TWENTY IS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSMITTED DATA FROM SENSORS AROUND THE PLANE THE RESPECTED INDUSTRY WEBSITE THE AVIATION HERALD HAS PUBLISHED THE MESSAGES WHICH IT SAYS COME FROM THREE INDEPENDENT CHANNELS
THE FIRST ALERT INDICATES THAT THE RIGHT COCKPIT WINDOW HAD BEEN OPENED OVER THE NEXT TWO MINUTES THERE WAS AN ALERT SUGGESTING SMOKIN A LAVATORY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY ONE INDICATING SMOKE IN THE AVIONICS BAY THE AREA UNDERNEATH THE FLIGHT TANK WHERE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE INSTALLED
FINALLY THERE WERE TWO MORE ALERTS SUGGESTING PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRBUSES FLIGHT CONTROL COMPUTER INCLUDING THE SPOILER ELEVATOR CONTROLLER WHICH CONTROLS THE FLAPS RESPONSIBLE FOR PITCH AND ROLL THE EDITOR OF AVIATION SECURITY INTERNATIONAL PHILLIP SAYS IT COULD MEAN THAT SOME POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE CRASH CAN BE RULED OUT
SOME WRECKAGE BELONGINGS AND BODY PARTS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY SERGE TEAMS SCOURING FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN THE SEARCHERS PARTICULARLY WANT TO FIND THE PLANE'S FLIGHT RECORDERS A FRENCH PATROL BOAT CAPABLE OF PICKING UP THE UNDERWATER PINGS EMITTED BY THE RECORDERS IS ON ITS WAY BUT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS TO ARRIVE
THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED A WARNING BY GEORGE OSBORNE THAT HOUSE PRICES WOULD TAKE A HIT OF UP TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E. USE THE TREASURY WILL PUBLISH THE FORECAST NEXT WEEK BUT VOTE LEAVE SAYS IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM AND HAS EXPRESSED AMAZEMENT THAT CIVIL SERVANTS ARE PREPARED TO MAKE IT OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME OWL AHMED IS IN JAPAN WHERE THE CHANCELLOR IS ATTENDING A G.SEVEN MEETING
AFTER THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE BRUTES SIZE OF THE ECONOMY THE TREASURY IS CHANGING TACK THE NEW REPORT ON THE SHORT TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING THE E.U. WILL FOCUS ON WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DESCRIBE AS MATTERS CLOSER TO THE EVERY DAY IT WILL CLAIM THAT JOB'S WAGES AND HOUSE PRICES WILL ALL BE AFFECTED ACCORDING TO THE REPORT HOUSE PRICES COULD BE UP TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT LOWER IN VALUE IN TWO YEARS THAN THEY WOULD BE IF BRITAIN REMAINED IN THE E.U.
GEORGE OSBORNE SAID THAT A SMALLER ECONOMY HIGHER MORTGAGE RATES UNLESS CONSUMER SPENDING POWER WOULD ALL REDUCE DEMAND WHICH IN TURN WOULD LEAD TO LOWER PRICES MANY ECONOMISTS SAY THAT ANY FALL IN HOUSE PRICES SHOULD BE WELCOMED AS IT WOULD HELP FIRST TIME BUYERS
LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ALSO ARGUE THAT IF BRITAIN LEFT THE E. U. ITS ECONOMY WOULD BE REVITALISED FREE THEY BELIEVE FROM THE SHACKLES OF THE SINGLE MARKET
LABOUR WILL SET OUT ITS APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING TODAY INCLUDING WAYS OF TACKLING THE HOUSING CRISIS MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE CHEAP MORTGAGES TO FIRST TIME BUYERS BUT THE NEWLY ELECTED LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON HAS REJECTED THE IDEA OF GIVING NEW POWERS TO COUNCILS TO REGULATE PRIVATE RENTS IN THEIR AREAS HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL IS PROPOSING TO GIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES KNEW POSED TO REGULATE RENTS AS PART OF HIS PLANS TO TACKLE WHAT HE CALLS AN UNFORGIVING HOUSING MARKET THE NATURE OF THE REGULATIONS WOULD BE OPEN TO CONSULTATION BUT ARE LIKELY TO BE IN LINE WITH LABOUR'S PRE ELECTION POLICY OF LIMITING ANY INCREASES AND RENT TO BELOW THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR THE PERIOD OF HER TENANCY BUT RATHER THAN A NATIONAL IMPOSED SYSTEM IT WOULD NOW BE UP TO LOCAL COUNCILS TO DECIDE WHETHER SUCH CONTROLS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE
THE NEW LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON SETTEE KHAN HAS ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DOESN'T FAVOUR RENT CONTROLS IN THE CAPITAL THE NATIONAL LANDLORDS' ASSOCIATION WELCOME THEY MUST FOCUS AND MAKING HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE BUT WANT TO PARTY NOT TO PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER THE FEET OF RESPONSIBLE LANDLORDS

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION SAYS THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE AN ONLINE TICKET FRAUD WITH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES ARE KINDLY FOR NEARLY HALF OF ALL REPORTED SCAMS IT'S RESEARCH SUGGESTS SPORTS AND MUSIC FANS IN THE U.K. LOST MORE THAN FIVE MILLION POUNDS TO FRAUDSTERS OPERATING TICKET WEBSITES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIMON BLACKBURN SPEAKS FOR THE L.G. EH WE BELIEVE IT ON AVERAGE PEOPLE GOT A BALL TICKETS HAVE LOST
WE KNOW THAT CRIMINALS ARE FAKING TICKET BY USING COAL TO COPY
TAKE IT FROM BEING SOLD ON OVER AND OVER AGAIN
WHICH WON'T WORK WHEN YOU GET TO THE VENUE
THE FINALS OF THE F.A. CUP AND THE SCOTTISH CUP ARE BEING PLAYED THIS AFTERNOON RANGERS TAKE ON HER BERNIE AND AT HAMPDEN PARK AT WEMBLEY ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CLUBS IN BRITISH FOOTBALL MANCHESTER UNITED TAKE ON CRYSTAL PALACE ASIDE THAT'S NEVER WON A MAJOR TROPHY UNITED AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SEASON BY THEIR STANDARDS ARE HOPING TO PUT THEIR NAME ON THE TROPHY FOR THE TWELFTH TIME KITTY GORNALL REPORTS
NINETEEN NINETY WAS A PIVOTAL YEAR FOR MANCHESTER UNITED THERE WIN OVER CRYSTAL PALACE IN THE F.A. CUP FINAL REPLAY DELIVER THE CLUB ITS FIRST TROPHY UNDER SIR ALEX FERGUSON AND PROBABLY SAVED HIM FROM THE SACK TWENTY SIX YEARS LATER THEIR CURRENT MANAGER SEEMS EVEN MORE VULNERABLE AFTER MISSING OUT ON CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUALIFICATION EVEN A WIN THIS EVENING MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO SAVE LILY FOUND
UNITED MAY VIEW THE F.A. CUP AS A CONSOLATION PRIZE FOR CRYSTAL PALACE IT WOULD BE THEIR FIRST MAJOR TROPHY THEIR MANAGER ALAN PART YOU PLAYED FOR PALACE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NOW HE'S LEADING THEM BACK TO WEMBLEY AND HOPING THIS YEAR OF THE UNDERDOG HAS ONE FINAL TWIST KATIE GO ON REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AT THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN MARC ARROW HAS SAID THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION STILL ABOUT WHY THE EGYPT AIRPLANE
CRASHED WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL POSSIBILITIES HE SAID BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS REPORTS NOW THAT THERE WAS SMOKE ON BOARD AND AN APPARENT PROBLEM WITH THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM JUST BEFORE IT WENT DOWN LET'S TURN TO KEVIN COLONIES A CORRESPONDENT END CARROT AND KEVIN BRING US UP TO DATE WHAT ARE ONE OF THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES SAY
THE LATEST INFORMATION DUSTIN IS COMING FROM AVIATION EXPERTS THIS IS STUFF POSTED ON THE INTERNET OVERNIGHT WHICH IS REPORTING DATA COLLECTED BY THE AIRCRAFT AUTOMATIC REPORTING SYSTEMS
SO THIS IS DATA THAT COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SEND IN FLIGHT PASSIVELY THAT'S TO SAY IT'S NOT ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE COCKPIT PUSHING BUTTONS TO TRANSMIT TO THE GRAND AND IT MONITORS HOW ALL THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING
IT'S TELLING US THAT THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE AVIONICS BAY SMOKE IN THE BATHROOM THAT A COCKPIT WINDOW WAS OPENED AND THAT THEIR FLIGHT TROLL COMPUTERS AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT APPEARED TO FAIL SO CLEARLY THINGS
WE'RE GOING CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG IN THOSE FINAL MOMENTS AT THE EGYPTIAN AUTHORITIES DON'T LIKE MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHEN THE FLOW OF INFORMATION
HE'S OUTSIDE THEIR CONTROL SO I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO RESPOND TO THESE BITS AND PIECES OF TECHNICAL DATA
WHICH ARE HARD TO INTERPRET AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ATTITUDE OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THIS IT'S CLEAR AND WE'RE NOW ABLE TO FLESH OUT THIS IMPRESSION OF AN AIRLINER IN DESPERATE TROUBLE IN THE CLOSING MOMENTS OF ITS FLIGHT AS PERHAPS WE MIGHT HAVE ASSUMED ANYWAY WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
AND WHAT THIS KIND OF TECHNICAL DATA DOESN'T TELL US IS WHAT CAUSED IT TO GO OUT OF CONTROL IN THAT WAY THE SMOKE MAY BE THE RESULT OF SOME SORT OF EXPLOSIVE DEVICE ON BOARD I SUPPOSE BUT IT EQUALLY BE THE RESULT
SOME KIND OF TECHNICAL FAILURE AND WE WON'T REALLY BE CLOSER TO A PROPER DEFINITIVE ANSWERS THERE PUT THESE BITS OF INFORMATION IN CONTEXT UNTIL THEY FIND THE FLIGHT RECORDERS WHICH ARE OF COURSE UNDER THE WATERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN YES AND WHICH MAY NOT BE FOUND FOR SOME DAYS IT WOULD SEEM
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A SLIGHT TENDENCY I THINK IN EUROPE TO SEE THE MEDITERRANEAN AS A SMALL SEA WHICH COURSE IN RELATIVE TERMS IT IS BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SEARCH AREA
THEY ARE LOOKING IN AN AREA OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES NORTH OF THE EGYPTIAN COAST SO THERE'S AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF PRECISION ACTUALLY ABOUT WHERE THE AIRCRAFT MAY HAVE HIT THE WATER BUT THEY ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT A SEARCH AREA OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE KILOMETRE SAVED A LOT OF NAVAL SHIPS OPERATING AN AREA
EVEN IF THEY FIND THE BLACK BOX FLIGHT TO TRANSMIT A SIGNAL AND THAT IS LOCATED IT MAY THEN BE DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM THE SEA BECAUSE THAT PART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
HAS A VERY DEEP TRENCH IN IT I THINK IT'S MUCH THREE KILOMETRES DEEP IN FACT SO THE RECOVERY OPERATION OF THE BLACK BOX MAY ALSO BE LONG AND DELICATE SO THE PRESSURE FROM THE FAMILY'S HERE FOR ANSWERS IS OVERWHELMING WE'VE MET SOME OF THE FAMILY'S YESTERDAY THEY'RE VERY RELUCTANT TO TALK THAT THEY ARE NONE WITH GRIEF AND THERE I SPOKE TO THE PILOT'S COUSIN WHO SAID THE FAMILY
A SHATTERED THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY HAS BEEN AFFECTED THEY CAN BARELY BELIEVE THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE HEART OF THIS STORY THEY'RE DESPERATE
FOR MORE CONCRETE INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE RESIGNED TO THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE DAYS MAYBE WEEKS BEFORE THEY REALLY START TO GET A FULL ON PROPER PICTURE NOT JUST OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PLANE BUT WHY IT HAPPENED TELLING CUDDLING CARD THANKS
THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE FIGURES COULD NOT BE CLEARER THEY COULD SCARCELY BE STARKER THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND IS RUNNING A RECORD DEFICIT OF ALMOST TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF HOSPITAL TRUST WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BOOKS THIS YEAR IN THE WORDS OF THE HEALTH FOUNDATION IN INDEPENDENT THINK TANK THE FINANCES OF THE HEALTH SERVICE ARE IN A TRULY DREADFUL STATE THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHETHER THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE DIFFICULT YEARS ARE A SIGN THAT BRITAIN IS SIMPLY NOT SPENDING ENOUGH IF IT IS GOING TO MEET THE DEMANDS FOR HELP
AND SOCIAL CARE HEALTH OUR NATION'S DIRECTOR RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS IS A METRE CHARLESWORTH JOINS ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU START WITH THE FIGURES THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY IF YOU WOULD TRULY DREADFUL IN YOUR WORDS BUT THEY STILL MASK DEEPER UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THEY'RE THERE ONE YEAR'S FIGURES AND IN THAT YEAR WHAT LOTS OF HOSPITALS HAVE DONE PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLY HE'S NOT SPENT INVESTMENT MONEY ON NEW CAPITAL PROJECTS BUT USE THAT SOME OF THAT MONEY TO COVER DAY TO DAY RUNNING COSTS SO ACTUALLY THEY'RE BUILDING UP UNDERLYING PROBLEMS WHICH ARE PROBABLY LARGER THAN THE TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS THAT THEY REPORTED YESTERDAY AND NOT ONLY ARE THEY BUILDING UP PROBLEMS BUT THE MONEY
GO INTO THEM GETS LESS GENEROUS IN FUTURE YEARS ISN'T IT BECAUSE YOU DID THIS IS A FAT COMPARED WITH SOME RATHER LENI IS COMING UP THAT'S RIGHT AND WE'RE BASICALLY HALFWAY THROUGH WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE DECADE OF AUSTERITY FOR THE N.H.S. FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE IS GROWING BY ABOUT ONE PER CENT A YEAR BUT THAT'S A QUARTER OF WHAT IT'S HISTORICALLY GROWN AT A MUCH LESS WHEN THE PRESSURE'S ON THE SERVICE FROM AN AGEING AND GROWING POPULATION AND RISING COSTS FROM NEW DRUGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
PEOPLE SOMETIMES FIND THIS HARD TO GRASP IT IS NOT IN OTHER WORDS A LOT FOR MINISTERS TO SAY WE ARE INCREASING SPENDING WE'RE INCREASING IN MORE THAN ON MOST OF THE SERVICES IT IS GOING UP AND EAT IT SIMULTANEOUSLY BE TRUE BUT IT'S A VERY BIG SQUEEZE THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE
THE PRESSURES ON THE HEALTH SERVICE ARE PRETTY UNREMITTING SO FUNDING JUST ISN'T KEEPING PACE WITH THOSE PRESSURES WE'RE REIGNING TO BRIDGE THAT GAP BY FISSION ZI AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS REALLY AFTER FIVE YEARS OF THIS RELATIVE SQUEEZE THE N.H.S. IS RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE ITS EFFICIENCY NOW THAT RAISES THE QUESTION THEREFORE WHETHER AS A NATION WE'RE JUST SPENDING TOO LITTLE
ON HEALTH COMPARED WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IS NOT SO MANY YEARS AGO A SINCE TONY BLAIR SAID WE'VE GOT THIS AMBITION WE'VE GOT TO GET UP TO THE EUROPEAN AVERAGE AND THE WAY THAT TENDS TO BE MEASURED ISN'T IT IS AS A SHARE OF NATIONAL INCOME A SHARE OF G.D.P. WHAT ARE THE FIGURES TELLING US THEY'RE SO FOR PUBLIC SPENDING AND PRIVATE SPENDING ACROSS THE U.K. NEW FIGURES SHOW THAT WE SPEND ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF OUR G.D.P. ON HEALTH BROADLY DEFIED IT INCLUDES LOTS OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN GLEN SOCIAL CARE
THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME AS COUNTRIES LIKE BELGIUM AND AUSTRIA BUT IT'S LESS THAN FRANCE AND GERMANY AND IF WE WERE SPENDING WHAT FRANCE AND GERMANY AS SPENT ON HEALTH CARE WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY BILLION MORE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MONEY ACTUALLY WE'VE EITHER GOT TO AGREE IS A NATION TO SPEND THAT MONEY WE'VE GOT TO RAISE EVEN MORE FROM EFFICIENCIES AND SPEND IT BETTER THAT'S RIGHT OF COURSE IF WE SPEND MORE ON THE HEALTH SYSTEM
WE CAN'T SPEND THAT ON OTHER THINGS AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE EDUCATION THEY'RE ACTUALLY BENEFIT OUR HEALTH CARE IS WHERE OUR HEALTH AS WELL SO IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SPENDING HIS TIME FOR THAT DEBATE IN YOUR VIEW ABSOLUTELY WELL WE'RE GOING PURSUE THAT MORE WITH SIR DAVID NICHOLSON WHO USED TO RUN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND HE'S TALKING TO US AFTER HOPPER STATE THIS MORNING THANK YOU TURN OUR SIXTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN RORY CATHERINE JONES OUR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT HAS HIRED A PERSONAL ASSISTANT AND

THE IDEA IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPANIES ARE BIG COMPETITION HERE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALL MORE AND MORE CLEVER MACHINES MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY THEIR FOOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS GOT VERY GOOD THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESS AND THEY WEE IDEAS THAT YOU HAD JUST HAD THIS SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE AND YET SHUT UP IS IT THIS IS WHAT CAN YOU ORDER A CAR WITH IT OR YOU CAN ORDER AN ORDER AN OBOE WITH IT OR YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WITH IT AND IT DOES CREEK SOME PEOPLE OUT INCLUDING MY WIFE BECAUSE IT'S LISTENING ALL THE TIME ALEXIS IS LISTENING ALL THE TIME AND THE BLUE LIGHTS JUST GONE ON AS I SAID ALEXIS LET'S HAVE ONE MORE GO AT SAYING SOMETHING AN EXCERPT TELL ME A JOKE

BASICALLY A VOICE ACTIVATED SPEAKER BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS THERE THERE'S HUGH IT WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CYCLE OF DEVELOPMENT WHERE BY THE MACHINES GET ABLE TO ANSWER MORE AND MORE QUERIES AND INTERACT WITH YOU IN A MORE AND MORE HUMAN WAY IT'S STILL PRETTY CREEPY AT THE MOMENT IN PRETTY CLUNKY BUT IT'S MAKING HUGE PROGRESS AND TO THE COMPANY'S BILLY THE TECH COMPANIES BELIEVE THAT THIS REALLY IS THE NEW WAVE OF AN AREA WHERE THEY'LL MAKE MONEY AND WILL
PROGRESS TOWARDS HUMAN HAPPINESS INTO THAT WELL THERE'S A VAST AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT GOING INTO IT MICROSOFT IS DOING IT APPLE IS DOING IT FOR YOU YOU'VE SEEN SIRI WHICH IS NOW LOOKING PERHAPS SLIGHTLY
DATED CAN HOPE SOME OF THESE AND AMAS AND ANNA SAID GOOGLE AND THAT'S BEEN THE BIG DEVELOPMENT THIS WEEK GOOGLE WHICH MAKES ALL OF ITS MONEY FROM ADVERTISING BUT HAS THIS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY UNDERNEATH IT THIS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IT'S POURED VAST AMOUNTS INTO FOR INSTANCE BE ABLE TO BEAT YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT THAT GOO PLAYER IN THAT GAME A FEMUR IT'S NOW
PROMISING TO BRING THAT INTO ALL SORTS OF AREAS OF OUR LIVES SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK TO GOOGLE AND GOOGLE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THINGS FOR US IN THE BEDDING WHICH SOME OF US MAY FIND IF THERE IS A TEST TAKE ALEXIS CAN ELECT TO DO THE TIME JAKE AS ROY SHE COULD DO BUT I BET SHE WON'T AND OF WHAT'S THE TIME
SHE'S IS STRIKING SEEMS GONE ON STRIKE MY PHONE COULD TELL US A LITTLE BIT DISCOLOURED JOHN'S CALLED DESMOND WORTH IT FOR THE OTHER THEY WERE IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST US AND WE LIVE IN AN ERA WHEN ALL THE PRESSURE IS ON TOWNS AND CITIES TO COME TOGETHER TO FORM THEIR OWN POWER HOUSES TO TAKE ON LONDON THE PLENTY PLACES DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING SUBSUMED BY THEIR BIG
METROPOLITAN BROTHER TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ROYAL TOWN OF SUTTON COALFIELD IT'S GOT ITS OWN TOWN COUNCIL AGAIN AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF BEING PART OF BIRMINGHAM IT WAS A DECISION THEY TOOK IN A REFERENDUM THIS WILL BE THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST TOWN COUNCIL THE FIRST IN METROPOLITAN AREA AND IT'S GOT A BUDGET TO MATCH SO WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH IT AND COULD GUSHER IN A NEW KIND OF LOCAL POLITICS DAY BUT MULLEN HAS BEEN TO SUTTON COALFIELD TO FIND OUT IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO OPEN
THIS MEETING IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET A RINGSIDE SEAT AT THE START OF A NEW DEMOCRACY TO CALL THIS AN HONOUR A PRIVILEGE DOESN'T REALLY DO IT JUSTICE A COUNSEL FOR THE TOWN LAST THAT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AS THE FORTY TWO YEARS OF HURT THAT SOME LOCAL PEOPLE HERE HAVE FELT SINCE BECOMING PART OF BIRMINGHAM IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR
NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR YES I'VE CAMPAIGNED AGAINST US GOING INTO BIRMINGHAM WHEN I WAS MUCH
KEN RUSHTON WAS THE MAN WHO LED THE CAMPAIGN TO GET THIS TOWN COUNCIL WISH TO THAT THEY'RE IN FOR RIGHT AND WE HAD SO THAT WAS THE THING THAT DROVE LOOSE THE THING THE WAY
IS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WATCH
NOW THAT IT'S HERE AND ELECTED THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT'S IT GOING TO DO
WHAT CAN IT DO MY NAME'S NICK RANDALL ON THE INTERIM TOWN CLERK AT SUTTON COALFIELD TEN COUNCIL THE TWENTY ELEVEN LOCALISM ACT EFFECTIVELY ALLOWED COUNCILS TO DO ANYTHING THAT ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CAN DO COUNCILS ARE FREED FROM THE CONSTRAINTS ARE JUST LOOKING AT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT DOING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR RUNNING BUSINESSES OR TAKING OVER HER SERVICES WHICH ARE NOT BEING FUNDED ELSEWHERE SO THE TOWN COUNCIL CAN TAKE ON QUITE A BIT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND IT'S GOT A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BUDGET TO PLAY WITH
LOOK SCRUFFY LOOK AT ALL THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND EVERYTHING ON THE TOP TRYING TO THE BEST TO FIND OUT WHAT SORT OF THEIR PRIORITIES OFF I WENT ON A TOUR AROUND SUTTON COALFIELD TO TALK TO SOME OF THE KEY PLAYERS WHAT WE'D WALKED OUT AND WHAT WE HAVE WALKED IT IN THE TOWN CENTRE MY GUIDE WAS NIGEL WALDRON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
SUCCESSFUL MOVE WILL BE
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE COMING
A SMARTER TOWN CENTRE
BITTER ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE FACT WE CAN FILL IN
TO BE PART OF THE TOWN
IF YOU EVER NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE AREA COME AND SEE MY TWO FAVOURITE OF YOURS
TO BE IN THE NECK BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM DOWN
I'M SITTING HERE IN MY BOOK MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF SOME COALFIELDS JULES IT'S CRIME SUTTON PARK BLACK ROOT POOL WITH CLAIRE BENNET'S HELLO ONE OF THE FOUR INDEPENDENT COUNCILLORS ELECTED
THAT'S ME INDEPENDENCE FOR CERTAIN EVERYONE STOOD FOR ELECTION AS AN INDEPENDENT BELIEVE PASSIONATELY THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR PARTY POLITICS IN LOCAL POLITICS TINY TINY LOCAL POLITICS I THINK ARE THE WAY FORWARD
BUT OF COURSE THE BIG PARTIES DID STAMPED ACROSS TIME AT THE BISHOP BUSY PUB I MET ROB PO COCK ONE OF THE TWO LABOUR COUNCILLORS ELECTED BUT THE CANDIDATE WE'VE GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANYONE
I DID TOOK THE POLLED REMARKABLY N.C. FERN LABOUR PARTY CANDIDATE BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR ME BECAUSE I FOUGHT VERY HARD
ACHIEVE THIS DEMOCRATIC REFORM FOR SUDDENLY CROSSED AND BEYOND PARTY POLITICS A NEW KIND OF POLITICS I THINK AS A COMMUNITY POLITICS PEOPLE PUT IN THEIR COMMUNITY FIRST THAT'S A BIG TEST FOR ALL OF US THE PUBLICAN SUTTON HAVE VOTED FOR HIM
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BIG ENOUGH TO STAND UP AGAINST THE POINTY MACHINES AND SO WE PUT IN THE COMMUNITY
AND SO TO THE TOWN HALL AND THE TOWN'S NEW MAYOR CONSERVATIVE COUNCILLOR CHARLOTTE HOLLY VARLA YES WE DO HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG MANDATE FROM THE PEOPLE OF SUTTON COALFIELD HEATH ELECTED FOR A VERY STRONG CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY ON THAT COUNCIL
AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS BALANCE TO BE OFFERED BY HAVING SOME REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER PARTIES ON THERE AND I'M SURE THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER ON DELIVERING THAT BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT POWER IT'S ABOUT SERVING THE PEOPLE OF SUTTON COALFIELD AND I HOPE WE CAN
FIRST MEETING OF THE COUNCIL HAS BROKEN UP AND THERE'S BEEN NO SHORTAGE OF AMBITION EXPRESSED FOR THE FUTURE OF THE TIME HE FEELS LIKE A GENUINELY NEW CHAPTER FOR SUTTON COALFIELD BUT JUDGING BY THE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS COUNCIL AND THE EXTRA FIFTY QUID ON TOP OF THEIR COUNCIL TAX THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT THEY WILL EXPECT A LOT IT'S A BIG MOMENT FOR THE LOCALISM AGENDA TO NICK RANDALL THE TIME CLOCK THINKS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE WATCHING
NATIONALLY THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTING HOUSE SUTTON COALFIELD SHAPES UP IT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO YOU KNOW TO DO NEW THINGS IN NEW WAYS AND I THINK EVERYBODY IS INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THINGS TURN OUT

AND I'M AFRAID I'M STRUGGLING I'M STRUGGLING FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON THE FOOT VERY FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY IMPACTING ON THE HOUSING MARKET TODAY AND IN A PIECE IN THE GUARDIAN THIS MORNING HILARY OSBORNE IT'S VERY SENSIBLY HIGHLIGHTING EXACTLY WHAT THAT IMPACT IS LOOKING LIKE WE'VE GOT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS NOW GIVING BUYERS OPTIONS TO BAIL OUT DEPENDING UPON THE RESULT ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE
AND LIKE ALL MARKETS INDEED LIKE THE HOUSING MARKET TWELVE MONTHS AGO OVER THE GENERAL ELECTION WE DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY AND IT'S THAT UNCERTAINTY THAT'S ALREADY PUSHING HOUSE PRICES IN PRIME CENTRAL LONDON DOWNED BY ROUGHLY TEN PER CENT ALREADY THIS YEAR AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT COULD INFECT THE WIDER MARKET AND IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT THE FRENCH AND THE GERMANS AND WHAT THEY DECIDE TO DO WAS GOING TO IMPACT ON THE AVERAGE BRITS ENTHUSIASM WENT HOME ON HOMEOWNERS
BUT WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER BRECHT'S IT IS THAT THE VALUE OF THE POUND FALLS THAT INTEREST RATES HAVE TO GO UP QUITE SHARPLY AND THAT IS THE THING THAT THEN DRIVES THIS FALL IN HOUSE PRICES AND THAT HE'S NOT COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE IS IT
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT IN ON THAT POINT I THINK HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S THAT AS A RESULT IT'S THEREFORE PAYING IT'S WORTH WERFEL WORTH PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO WHAT THE ECONOMISTS THOSE LIKE MARK CARNEY THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND ARE SAYING ABOUT THE LIKELY IMPACT ON THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT BECAUSE WHILST MANY LISTENERS WILL NO DOUBT BE HOPING
LOWER HOUSE PRICES MIGHT MAKE HOMES MORE AFFORDABLE ACTUALLY IRONICALLY THE COST OF MONEY MAY GO UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO BORROW MONEY MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT AND AS A RESULT PEOPLE MAY FIND HOMES ADJUSTERS UNAFFORDABLE AS THEY ARE TODAY EVEN THOUGH ACTUAL PRICES FALLEN YEAH THAT'S GOING TO DISAPPOINT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THAT FIGURE THAT EIGHTEEN PERCENT FIGURE THAT FALL OVER TWO YEARS AND WILL HAVE THOUGHT ASH YOU KNOW THAT
JOLLY GOOD THING IT'S NOT A CATASTROPHIC FALL IT'S QUITE A SHARP CORRECTION BUT IT'S ONE THAT WE COULD DO IT COS WE NEED TO MAKE HOUSES MORE AFFORDABLE YOU'RE SAYING MY NO WORK LIKE THAT I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT DISAPPOINTING NEWS THE REFERENDUM ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE IS GOING TO IMPACT IN SEVERAL WAYS UNDOUBTEDLY BUT IT IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE MORE HOMES TO BE BUILT THAN THEY ALREADY PLANNED AS A RESULT WE'RE GOING TO STILL HAPPEN WE THAT HAVE OVER DEMAND FROM PEOPLE WHO'D LIKE HOMES TO BLOCKED OPPONENT TO RENT
THAT IF PRICES WERE TO FALL THAT WOULD BE FASCINATING AND WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE BUT AGAIN THE KEY TO THIS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT BOTH THE COALITION GOVERNMENT OF OLD AND THE CURRENT CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION ARE STRUGGLING TO DO IS TO BRING HOMES BACK TO BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE IF THEY COULD DO THAT BUT I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS FOR THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE ALL THE MORE EASILY AND JUST TO GET BACK TO THIS EIGHTEEN PERCENT FIGURE WHICH WAS ODDLY
PRECISE REALLY WERE SHE SAID BETWEEN TEN AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT DIDN'T HE BID A BID ME EIGHTEEN PERCENT WAS THE MAXIMUM AND IT AND IT IT'S ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ESSENTIALLY TO STIRLING I SUPPOSE AND WE WE CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW YOU CAN'T POT IF IT WOULD HELP IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CAN YOU IF IT WOULD HELP JUSTIN I'M VERY HAPPY TO WAVE A WET FINGER IN THE AIR AND COME UP WITH A FIGURE BUT FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE WHAT WE NEED HERE IS SOME INFORMAL DEBATE ABOUT THE FACTS I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF LISTENING TO THE SQUABBLING
PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFESSIONALLY INVOLVED IN THESE KIND OF DECISIONS I'M SURE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIVETING BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US WE'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE FACTS WOULD BE IN THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE COME AS A RESULT LEAVING OR STAYING IN THE E.U. IS NOT GOING TO IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S ENTHUSIASM FOR PROPERTY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT MAY WELL MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE MONEY BUT JUST A FINAL POINT THEM ON THAT
POINT THAT YOU BRING UP ABOUT PEOPLE'S ENTHUSIASM FOR PROPERTY IN THIS COUNTRY THINKING ABOUT FOREIGNERS BUYING HERE AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS PARTICULARLY ON THE MARKET IN LONDON BUT TO AN EXTENT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL
DIZ DIZ A YOU FACTORED IN IS ANYONE THINKING ABOUT THE ATTRACTIVENESS STROKE AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF BRITAIN OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WHETHER IT WOULD AFFECT BAD OR ARE PEOPLE JUST STORING THEIR MONEY HERE BECAUSE IT'S A SAFE PLACE TO DO IT NOW CAROL
WHILE THE GOVERNMENT I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO BE BRUTAL HERE JUST IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE ALREADY GIVEN A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD VERY CLEAR TWO FINGERS TO FOREIGNERS WANTING TO BUY PROPERTY IN UNITED KINGDOM IN THE MARKET HAS REACTED NEGATIVELY AS A RESULT IT'S NOW MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR SOMEBODY OUTSIDE THE UNITED KINGDOM TO COME HERE AND BUY PROPERTY AT THE WHOLE PROPERTY MANY PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING IN FACT THE TOTAL NUMBERS THAT ACTUALLY DO MAKE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO THE OVERALL HOUSING MARKET ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM
IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE AS MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE LONDON AND THE UNITED KINGDOM TO BE A DESTINATION OF CHOICE TO BE SOMEWHERE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO BOTH TO LIVE AND TO WORK THEN WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF VERY I WOULD SAY PERHAPS SLIGHTLY WHAT MAURA REFINED ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THESE ARGUMENTS YES
BRITAIN WILL MAINTAIN ITS POSITION IN THE WORLD AS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WALK TO COME AND LIVE AND WORK I HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME TO COME BUT WE'VE GOT SOME BIGGER MORE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES TO DEAL WITH AND FRANKLY IT'S DANGEROUS IF WE START POINTING FINGERS AT FOREIGNERS FOR OUR PROBLEMS THAT WE GET TO SOLVE HENRY PRYOR ESTATE AGENT AND COMMENTATOR AN EXPERT AND HOUSING THANK YOU VERY MUCH

ARE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR EXTRAORDINARY BRING IN MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION POUNDS FOR THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY PUBLISHERS SAY THEY'LL FIGHT THE DECISION EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THIS WEEK'S GUEST ON MAKE THE AUTHOR IS JONATHAN COE ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBECCA JAMES TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS LATEST STATE OF THE NATION NOVEL NUMBER ELEVEN
ARCHED
TAKE ME HOME ABSENCE MAKES ME
JONATHAN COE IS A NOVELIST WHOSE BOOKS IMPRESS THE CRITICS WIN AWARDS BUT ALSO APPEAR REGULARLY ON THE BEST SELLER LISTS HE'S BEST KNOWN FOR WRITING SERIOUS NOVELS BUT ALSO VERY FUNNY
HE MADE HIS NAME WITH WHAT A CARVE UP A SATIRE ABOUT THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THEN CAME THE ROTTERS CLUB ABOUT LIFE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND ITS SEQUEL THE CLOSED CIRCLE WHICH SCRUTINISED THE NOUGHTIES HAVE NEW LABOUR
NOW COMES HIS ELEVENTH NOVEL WHICH IS CALLED NUMBER ELEVEN AND THIS TIME HE'S TURNING HIS GAZE ON BRITAIN TODAY
JONATHAN CAME THE NUMBER ELEVEN IS A REOCCURRING THEME IN THIS BOOK TELL US WHY
MORE FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON REALLY I DIDN'T HAVE A TITLE FOR THE BOOK TO START WITH SOMETIMES YOU GET ALMOST THE END OF THE BOOK WITHOUT HAVING ONE BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ONE FOR THE BOOKS I JUST WROTE NUMBER ELEVEN AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE AND IT STUCK AND OF COURSE NUMBER ELEVEN IS THE HOME OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER EXACTLY YES I WANTED IT TO TO GESTURE TOWARDS THE POLITICAL CONCERNS OF THE BOOK EVEN THOUGH AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WHEN I WRITE ABOUT POLITICS TO THE POLITICIANS OF THE DAY DAVID CAMERON JEREMY CORBIN GEORGE OSBORNE NOT ACTUALLY MENTIONED
NONETHELESS YOU TAKE AIM AT A WIDE RANGE OF TARGETS TAX EVASION FOOD BANKS LIBRARY CLOSURES REALITY TELEVISION YOU UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES THE PICTURE THAT YOU
PAINT OF BRITAIN TODAY IS SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING OH YOU VERY PESSIMISTIC I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I'M PESSIMISTIC BUT LIKE EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS I THINK WE'RE DOING WRONG THERE ARE THINGS WHICH GIVE RISE TO INJUSTICE
IT'S A IT'S A FACT I THINK AN UNDENIABLE FACT FATS LEVELS OF INEQUALITY OF WEALTH DISPARITY IN THIS COUNTRY ARE INCREASING ALL THE TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY ARE THREATENED TO CRASH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD CHANGE OUR WAYS WE WOULD NO LONGER RELY ON DEBTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AND SO ON
BUT IN FACT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BUSINESS AS USUAL SINCE THEN AND WHAT I WANTED TO CONVEY IN THIS BOOK WAS THE SENSE OF KIND OF SLIGHTLY TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF AN ECONOMIC PRECIPICE WHICH I THINK WE ALL FEEL A LITTLE BIT IN OUR BONES SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WHY DID YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND WRITE A STATE OF THE NATION AWFUL IT'S A VERY COMMON
NOVELISTIC IMPULSE TO WANT TO WRITE POINT TO CAPTURE NOT JUST THE EXPERIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS BUT SOME KIND OF SNAPSHOT OF
THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE YOU KNOW YOU FIND IT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NOVELISTS IN PARTICULAR AND I LOVE THAT AND I AND I WANT TO WORK WITH IN IT AT THE SAME TIME LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE STATE OF THE NATION NOVEL THIS IS PRONE TO CERTAIN CLICHES ARE VERY OFTEN IN PARTICULAR I THINK THE STATE MISSION OF THIS ACTUALLY ESTATE OF LONDON NOVEL AND I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO BE A LONDON CENTRIC BOOK BEGINS IN BEVERLEY IN YORKSHIRE IT MOVES DOWN THROUGH BIRMINGHAM AND THE COTSWOLDS SNIPPED IT FINISHES IN LONDON
BUT I WOULD REALLY I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT THE NATION IN A BROADER SENSE AND THAT
AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL BACKGROUND TO THE NOVEL IN SOME WAYS THAT STORIES ABOUT TWO GIRLS WHO WHO WE MEET HIS CHILDREN AND THEN GROW UP THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE NOVEL AND I WAS VERY STRUCK IN THIS NOVEL BY THE FACT THAT WOMEN TAKE CENTRE STAGE MOST OF THE NOVEL IS TOLD THROUGH THE EYES OF WINNING DO YOU PREFER WRITING THROUGH THE EYES OF WOMEN YEAH I DO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT USUALLY A CONSCIOUS DECISION BECAUSE I WANTED THAT TO BE AS WELL AS THE KIND OF
PESSIMISM IN THE SATIRICAL ANGER RUNNING THROUGH THE BOOK I WANTED THERE TO BE A NOTE OF GENTLE OPTIMISM CENTRING ON THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN TWO YOUNG PEOPLE QUITE EARLY ON IT FELT NATURAL TO ME THAT THEY WERE WOMEN THAT WAS A RELIEF IN A WAY BECAUSE I DO FIND IT EASIER TO WRITE MORE ENJOYABLE TO WRITE FROM THE FEMALE POINT OF VIEW I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL I DO IT BUT THERE'S A SENSE SLIGHT SENSE OF LIBERATION WHEN DOING THAT BECAUSE LIKE MANY WRITERS I WRITE TO ESCAPE MYSELF AND WHEN I'M WRITING FROM A MALE POINT OF VIEW THEY USUALLY COMES A KIND OF CLUNKING
POINT OF REALISATION IN THE WRITING OF A BOOK BUT ACTUALLY I'M WRITING ABOUT MYSELF AGAIN AND THAT'S THAT'S JUST TEDIOUS REALLY FOR ME AND THE READER WOULD YOU WOULD YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE FLAVOUR OF THAT BY READING US AN EXTRACT
THE PARADOX IS THIS I HAVE TO ASSUME FOR THE SAKE OF MY SANITY BUT I'M GOING MAD
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO BELIEVE THAT THE THING I SAW THE OTHER NIGHT WAS REAL AND IF I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BELIEVE THAT SURELY THE HORROR OF IT WOULD ALSO MAKE ME LOSE MY MIND IN OTHER WORDS I'M TRAPPED TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO CHOICES TO PATHS BOTH OF WHICH LEAD TO INSANITY
BUT NO I MUST PUT AN END TO THIS RAMBLING AND ATTEMPT TO SET DOWN THE STORY OF ANOTHER VISIT TO BEVERLEY TO STAY WITH MY GRANDPARENTS IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND AND THREE
VISITS I MADE NOT WITH MY BROTHER THIS TIME BUT WITH ALISON MY DEAR FRIEND ALISON WHO AT LAST AFTER SO MANY YEARS MYSTERIOUS DISTANCE I FOUND AGAIN PICKING UP THE THREADS OF OUR PRECIOUS FRIENDSHIP
THIS IS A STORY REALLY THE STORY OF HOW WE FIRST BECAME CLOSE BEFORE STRANGE NOT TO SAY RIDICULOUS FORCES INTERVENED AND DROVE US APART AND IT'S ALSO THE STORY OF
BUT NO I MUSTN'T SAY TOO MUCH JUST YET LET'S GO BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING
YOU WROTE WHAT A CARVE UP BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND YOU'VE WRITTEN A LOT OF NOVEL SINCE THEN DOES EAT URGH YOU IN ANY WAY THAT THAT STILL THE NOVEL YOU'RE BEST REMEMBERED FOR IT HAS DONE IN THE PAST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT NOVEL TO A WRITER IS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT THEY'VE JUST WRITTEN I KIND OF TURNED BY BACK ON WHAT A CARVE UP AND DIDN'T DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AND AND AND A SUCCESS NOW I'M JUST GRATEFUL THOSE WHO WOULDN'T BE
THAT I PUBLISHED A BOOK TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO AND WHICH PEOPLE STILL TALK ABOUT IT I NEVER DREAM THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN
REBEKAH JONES THERE TALKING TO JONATHAN COE AND AT THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THE FOR THE DAY AND SPEAKER AND I KIND OF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THIS RIPPON EH WHO A MEMBER OF THE TRAP AND A BUDDHIST ORDER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
WE'RE GOING FROM UP COMMAND MAN HISTORY NO IT'S AS THE BUDDHA DIED TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND YEARS AGO HIS FOLLOWERS FACED A QUESTION
WAS HE REALLY DEAD AND GONE THIS PERSON WHO TRANSFORMED THEIR LIVES AND SEEM TO EMBODY A REALITY SO MUCH GREATER THAN ORDINARY EXISTENCE
THEY KNEW THAT HIS INFLUENCE LIVED ON IN HIS TEACHING BUT WAS THERE SOME OTHER SENSE IN WHICH HE CONTINUED TO EXIST
A SIMILAR QUESTION FACES BUDDHISTS AROUND THE WORLD TODAY AS WE CELEBRATE BUDDHA DAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BUDDHA'S AWAKENING
THE BUDDHA HIMSELF REFUSED TO DISCUSS HIS STATUS AFTER DEATH SAYING HE WASN'T CONCERNED WITH SPECULATING ABOUT SUCH THINGS
HIS MESSAGE TO OTHERS WAS THAT THEY COULD LIBERATE THEMSELVES BY PRACTISING HIS TEACHINGS THEN THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY COME TO SEE THE WORLD AS HE DID UNDERSTAND NIRVANA THROUGH THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE
THE BUDDHA ALSO SAID THAT HIS EXPERIENCE OF AWAKENING MADE HIM MORE THAN A WISE COMPASSIONATE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY ORDINARY HUMAN BEING
SO OVER TIME THE FOCUS FOR SOME BUDDHISTS SHIFTED FROM THE HISTORICAL BUDDHA TO AN IDEAL OF BUDDHA HOOD THAT'S BEYOND TIME AND SPACE
THEN I DID THIS IN THE FIGURE OF THE ETERNAL BUDDHA WHICH IS OFTEN WHAT YOU LOOKING AT IN BUDDHIST IMAGES ESPECIALLY FAR EASTERN ONCE OTHER FIGURES HIM PUT UP BUT IF START REPRESENT PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND
MANY ARMS DENOTING COMPASSION A SWORD DEPICTING THE WISDOM THAT CUTS THROUGH IGNORANCE WERE A BODY SURROUNDED BY FLAMES THAT REPRESENT ENERGY
THE BUDDHISTS OF ALL TRADITIONS BUT A HERD MEANS THAT THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO HOW FAR WE CAN DEVELOP OURSELVES
PERSONALLY I LOVE THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF APPROACHING WHAT THIS MEANS THROUGH THE FIGURE OF THE BUDDHA
ONE IS ROOTED IN HUMANITY IN ONE TEXT DESCRIBING THE BUDDHA'S LAST YEAR HE TELLS US THAT AGED EIGHTY AND INCREASINGLY FRAIL HE'S LIKE AN OLD CART THAT'S TIED TOGETHER BY A FEW FRAYING ROPES
THESE WORDS WE CATCH THE DIGNITY OF A WISE MAN HE'S FACING
THE SECOND IS THROUGH THE ARCHETYPAL FORMS THAT OFFER A WAY TO CONNECT WITH QUALITIES THAT CAN'T BE PUT INTO WORDS WHAT DOES ENLIGHTENMENT LOOK LIKE
IMAGINE THE SKY PROFOUNDLY BLUE STRETCHING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE SHIMMERING GOLDEN FIGURE POISED AND VITAL RESTING IN IT SMITH'S RADIATING CALM AND PEACE
THAT'S THE BUDDHA THE ANCIENT SAGE AND A SYMBOL FOR OUR OWN MINDS AT THEIR FULLEST UNFOLDING
THE FIGURE OF THE BUDDHA FOR ME AND BODICE THIS THE UNLIMITED POTENTIAL OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THIS SHOW PIONEER THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE WHO SIGNED THE PETITION CALLING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO BE BARRED FROM VISITING BRITAIN IS MIGHT BE GOOD MOMENT TO SWITCH ON THE KETTLE AND MAYBE TURN THE RADIO DOWN A LITTLE THE MAN HE MIGHT BE AMERICA'S NEXT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT HAS BEEN INVITED TO COME HERE BY NONE OTHER THAN THE MAN WHO DUBBED HIS POLICY STUPID DIVISIVE AND WRONG YES THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF IS MISTER TRUMP THEN SLOWLY PERSUADING HIS CRITICS TO ACCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE REALLY BUT TO DO BUSINESS WITH HIM JIM JIM KNOCKED HERE IS BACK FROM A TRIP STATESIDE
WHERE THEY ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE TO ADAPT JIM WELL THEY CERTAINLY ARE NEXT THANK YOU AND IT IS TRUE THAT THE PARTY IS COMING ROUND IT'S EXACTLY THAT DEBATE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO ABOUT DONAL TRUMPETS OF COURSE CONSUMING THE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE HIS SLEDGEHAMMER AS CRUSHED HIS OPPONENTS IN THE PRIMARY IS THIS THE FINAL ROUND COMES ON JUNE THE SEVENTH HE'LL BE CROWNED NOMINEE AT THE CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND OR JULY BUT THE WOUNDS IN THE REPUBLICAN RAGS ARE VERY DEEP HERE'S A GOOD EXAMPLE RON MAILING A SPENT THEIR LAST LONG MONTHS IN THE HIGH COMMAND OF THE TED CRUISE CAMPAIGN
NO DEFEATED HE'S A FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CALIFORNIAN I MET HIM AT SAN DIEGO AIRPORT PRETTY WEARY LATE AT NIGHT HE WAS COMING HOME FROM THE LAST MEETING OF THE CREW'S CAMPAIGN IN TEXAS HOUSTON WHAT LAY AHEAD FOR TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS
WHAT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN EARS NUMBER ONE WILL DULL TRUMPY ABLE TO UNIFY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE NUMBER TWO WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT WILL HE HAVE
REPUBLICAN VOTER TURNOUT NUMBER THREE WHAT WITH THE IMPACT OF THIS CANNABIS HE'D BE ON DOWN TICKET CUPID'S KEEN IS FOR THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND STEAK HOUSES AS WELL HIS RAW QUESTIONS ARE THAT REMAINED TO BE SEEN
YOU'RE IMPLYING THERE
HE'S A LOSER WHAT HE STILL HAS AN UPHILL CLIMB IN ORDER TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MAN
THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT HE'S DEEPLY UNPOPULAR AND HE WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY UNIFYING THE PARTY BECAUSE HE IS TO A DEGREE TRAPPED IN HIS OWN BRAIN
HE RESORTED TO PERSONAL ATTACKS AND INSULTS REPUTEDLY PART OF THE REASON WHY A POLITICS YOU WANT TO AVOID
THAT IT MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO COME ALONGSIDE YOU LATER
SO HE'S TRAPPED IN THIS AND HE EMERGES AS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR FIGURES IN AMERICAN POLITICS IN DECADES
THE LAST CANDIDATE I CAN THINK OF OF WHOM THESE SORTS OF THINGS WERE SAID WAS WAS WALLASTON SIXTY EIGHT I MEAN THIS IS OUTSIDE THE FRAME
HE IS A SINGLE PHENOMENON IN AMERICAN POLITICS FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE
AND HE IS AN OUTSIDER AND THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY HE'S WON
EFFECTIVELY THE NOMINATION THAT HE'S AN OUTSIDER HOWEVER POLITICS IS NOT BUSINESS POLITICS IS A GAME OF THE DISH
AND SO FAR HE'S HAD INDICATED THAT HE
FULLY COMPREHENDS THERE AND COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON HIS SUCCESS
RON NEARING AND YOU CAN FEEL ALL THE PAIN THERE HOW DO YOU ADJUST TO THE WORLD THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SHAPED FOR THAT PARTY SEAN STEELE IS ANOTHER FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICANS IN CALIFORNIA A LIFELONG OPERATOR HE WAS A STUDENT ORGANISER FOR RONALD REAGAN IN HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR WAY BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND HAVING BEEN SCEPTICAL EVEN HOSTILE TO TRUMP HE FINDS HIMSELF MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE COMING ROUND
I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT TRUMP THINKING THAT HE WAS GOING TO HIT A CEILING I'LL BUY GUIDE AFTER SAYING THAT THING THERE'S NO WAY THAT IS GOING TO RECOVER AND HERE'S NUMBERS KEPT GROWING IN HIS INFLUENCE KEPT GROWING AND I'M SEEING A VERY SUBTLE CHEF BEFORE MY VERY EYES AS HE'S BEGINNING TO DOMINATE THE CABIN THE CANNOLI CRUMPS BIGGEST ENEMY WHAT ALWAYS BE AS BIGGEST ENEMY HAS DONE
AND IF HE'S GOT THE DISCIPLINE TO GET THE NOMINATION AND THEN HE GOES ON AROUND AFFECT AN EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN AND ACTUALLY PICKED UP THOSE STATE AT REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T SEEN SENSE RONALD REAGAN WE GET PENNSYLVANIA AND WEST IN UNLESS AGAIN IT'S ALL OVER FOR FOR CLAYTON AND THEN YOU START EVEN AGAIN
THE LATEST POLL SHOWING THAT THE RACE IS LITERALLY TIGHTENING SO ALL THESE WOMEN THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO HATE TRUMP OLLIE'S LATINO ALL THESE BLACKS ALL THESE MINING OLD ALL THESE OLD PEOPLE ALL THESE POOR PEOPLE ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ALL THESE EDUCATED PEOPLE THEY ALL HATE TRAP TO TRAVELLERS
TRUMP'S BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON MARK AND HEATHER IT'S NEARLY AN EVENLY DIVIDED RATES SO THAT SO THE ELITE ARE ARE REALLY ON THE WALL AND THEN THEY'RE SCRAMBLING ARE YOU SAYING AMERICA'S READY FOR
OH YEAH YEAH NO NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THEY ARE READY TO START A WHOLE NEW GENERATION THE PROFFER THEIR ASTONISHING HUGE NUMBER OF VOTE AND LITERALLY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEMOCRATS EVERY REGISTER REPUBLICAN IN THE EAST IT'S JUST AMAZING TO WATCH HE IS REALLY GRAND THE PARTY WILL WHEN
YES BUT YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY THE PORK'S TELL ME TODAY AT IT EVEN MONEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHAT THE BEDDING AS ALINE AND I STILL THINK IT'S LIKE SIXTY PLUS WERE HILARY I I SHOULD GET IN
CHEER THE RIDDLE OF THE THIRD PARTY MOVEMENTS DYING REASON EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT REPUBLICANS HAVE UNIFIED REASON WHY A LOT OF FOLKS YOU'D THINK WOULD BE CREDIT ALL THE TROUBLE BEING VERY SILENT NOW SAYING NICE THINGS ON IT BECAUSE TRAVEL LOOKS LIKE A WINNER
AND THAT MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE I THINK THE ODDS ARE A LITTLE BETTER THAN FIFTY FIFTY
JOHN STEEL WILL NEXT WEEK I'LL BE REPORTING ON THE RATHER BITTER CONCLUSION TO THE DEMOCRATS FIGHT BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON OR BERNIE SANDERS IS REACHING ITS CLIMAX AND LOOKING IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT SENDING REAL TREMORS THROUGH THEIR CAMP IN THEN WE IMMIGRATION BUT THAT'S THE LATEST NICK ON THE POSITION OF TRUMP FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THESE POLL NUMBERS THE SO CALLED UM FAVOUR ABILITY RATINGS OF DROPPING FOR TRUMP PARTICULARLY MONKEYS OWN PARTY WELL THEY ARE I THINK THAT THE INEVITABILITY OF THE NOMINATION MEANS THAT THAT HAPPENS
I THINK THE BIG THING IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT A PREFERENCES IN THE PRIMARY SEASON ARE ONE THING I LIKE THE CUT OF HIS JIB I LIKE THE SOUND OF WHAT HE SAYS IN THE FALL CAMPAIGN WHEN CLINTON AND
TAKE EACH OTHER ON IT'S NOT GONNA BE A CHOICE RATHER LIKE THAT ONE MORE THAN THAT ONE IT'S GOING TO BE WHO IS THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF THE WHOLE TONE CHANGES AND IT'S NOT FAR AWAY DENOTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THREE MINUTES LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE WEATHER HERE'S JAY WENT

THE TREASURY WILL PUBLISH THE FORECAST NEXT WEEK BUT VOTE LEAVE SAYS IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM AND HAS EXPRESSED AMAZEMENT THAT CIVIL SERVANTS ARE PREPARED TO MAKE IT OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME OW AHMED IS IN JAPAN WHERE THE CHANCELLOR IS ATTENDING A G.SEVEN MEETING
AFTER THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE BRUTES SIZE OF THE ECONOMY THE TREASURY IS CHANGING TACK THE NEW REPORT ON THE SHORT TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LEAVING THE E.U.

KATIE GO ON REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT WHERE HEARING SMALL TANTALISING PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAST MOMENTS OF THE EGYPT AIR PLANE THAT CRASHED INTO THE MEDITERRANEAN THIS WEEK SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT A WINDOW OPEN ALL OF THIS COMING FROM AUTOMATIC INFORMATION TRANSMITTED BY THE PLANE DOES IT ADD UP TO SOMETHING DOES IT BUILD A PICTURE OF THE LAST MOMENTS OF THE PLAY IN A PICTURE THAT'S A USEFUL TO HAVE AND INDEED DOES IT POINT TOWARDS THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH
MIGHT VIVIEN IS ON THE LINE CAPTAIN MIGHT THERE AND FORMER HEAD OF FLIGHT OPERATIONS AT THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY ALSO SECURITY ADVISER FORMALLY TO VIRGIN ATLANTIC GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN HERE WELL I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY SELECTED LEAKING COMES WITH A HEALTH WARNING IT ACTUAL INVESTIGATION PEOPLE WILL NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL
THESE ARE LIVE DATA LINKS THEM TRANSMITTED BY THE AIRCRAFT TO THE GROUND REALLY A WHOLE SERIES OF PARAMETERS TO CONFIRM THE HEALTH OF THE OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT AND MY HEALTH WARNING COMES WITH A FACT ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO RELEASE THIS INFORMATION SKILLED CODING IT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S CONFIRMED OR NOT AND WHY THESE SELECTIVE ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE THE COCKPIT WINDOW BEING OPEN I FIND
ALMOST INCREDULOUS UNLESS THAT WAS WITH A STRUCTURAL FAILURE OF THE AIRCRAFT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT INFORMATION WOULDN'T BE KNOWN OR WELL IT WOULD BE KNOWN SOME OF THAT WOULD BE NO NOT NOT NOT A FIRE DETECTION GOING OFF IN THE LOO BUT W. C. BUT THERE IS A WARNING SYSTEM ON THE FLIGHT DECK FOR A SMOKE BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS BUT CONFIRM FOR A RELIABLE SOURCE NOT FROM SOME SORT OF INTERMEDIATE WELL THE SAUCE AT THE MOMENT IS HIS IS THE WEBSITE OF THE AVIATION
HERALD WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A RESPECTED INDUSTRY WEBSITE WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT WELL I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF IT BUT LET ME SAY THIS IT'S A SKILL TO THE CODE THIS STUFF AND IT'S NORMALLY JUST SENT TO THE ENGINEERING BASE OF THE AIRLINE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH MONITORING THE HEALTH OF THE AIRCRAFT AND ITS SYSTEMS SO IT MAY NOT BE RELIABLE I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT A SELECTIVE LEAKING SMOKE IN THE LOO AS ONE I THINK THAT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME BUT NEVERTHELESS IT'S OUT THERE
AND SO IT HAS TO BE DEALT WITH IT WITH THERE'LL BE MORE INFORMATION THEN THAT THAT'S COME AUTOMATICALLY FOR THE PLAYING THAT WE'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT YES ABSOLUTELY LET'S NOT JUST RESTRICTED FOR THOSE TWO OR THREE ITEMS THAT'S MAKES ME SLIGHTLY PUZZLED WHY THAT HASN'T BEEN SO INTERESTING THAT WE JUST GOT THAT KOREM IT OR NOT THE REST YEAH O.K. WELL THAT'S THAT'S VERY INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAPTAIN FOR TALKING TO US AND A FEW SECONDS WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO ANOTHER
INDUSTRY EXPERT DAVID LEE AMOUNT FROM FLIGHT GLOBAL BUT FIRST LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF GETTING INFORMATION FROM PLANES TO PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WHEN AWFUL THINGS HAPPEN ON BOARD BECAUSE AS WE'VE JUST BEEN SAYING WE'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION BUT WE'RE NOT AT ALL CLEAR ABOUT HOW RELIABLE IT IS ONE OF THE AWFUL EXTRA AGONIES FOR THE RELATIVES OF PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS CRASH BUT ALSO IN OTHER PREVIOUS ONES IS THE LACK OF
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED NOT SO MUCH WHETHER IT WAS TERRORISM OR NOT THAT EXACTLY WHAT WENT ON IN THE PLANE WHERE EXACTLY THE PLACE WAS THAT THEIR RELATIVES DIED I'VE BEEN TALKING TO GRACE NATHAN WHOSE MOTHER WAS ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE ON BOARD THE MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT DAMAGE THREE SEVENTY BUT DISAPPEARED OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN AND HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND
I SUPPOSE THEY SEE JUST BEFORE YOU FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE PLANE AND EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY SOMEWHERE FIELDING IN A LIFE RAFT
AND THEN YOU JUST SIT AND YOU WAIT FOR THEM TO FIND SOMETHING ANYTHING AND AS THE HOPE FADES YEAH THE HOPE DEFINITELY FEAR DREADING ALGAE STUFF WE WERE HOPING THE FLAPPER UNLESS WE WERE HOPING WELL OVER A YEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO TELL US THAT THE PLANE HAD CRASHED AT THE PLANE I WAS IN THE OCEAN
I THINK I'LL GET THE HOPE IS NOW GONE AND IT'S DEFINITELY DIMINISHED AND QUITE A BIT IF YOU'VE HAD THIS AWFUL AWFUL
PERIOD OF NOT KNOWING ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR AS A GROUP I THINK IS THAT THE AIRLINES TO CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH AIRCRAFT SIGNALS ARE TRANSMITTED OR AT LEAST THE PLACE THAT THEY'RE RECORDED THAT TELL US ABOUT THAT WELL I THINK THE LEG SEVERAL THINGS THEN WE WOULD HOPE FOR AIRLINES TO ACCOMMODATE FOR AN HOUR I THINK THEN THE INDUSTRY STANDARD IS THAT PLANE'S ATTRACT EVERY TWENTY MINUTES
MAYBE YOU WOULD BE BETTER IF THE PLANE'S ATTRACT MORE FREQUENTLY MAYBE EVERY FIRE FIVE MINUTES INSTEAD AND RETHINK AND THEN THERE IS A NEED FOR BETTER EMERGENCY SIGNALLING EQUIPMENT
SO CURRENTLY WHAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SOMETHING AT THE FRONT OF THE PLANE WHICH GOES OFF WHEN THE PLANE THEY KIDS WARRIORS WHEN IT MAKES IMPACT IN SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS EMERGENCY SIGNALS THEN DEPLOY WHEN THE PLANE SUDDENLY DESCENDS LEGGING THE EGYPT ARGUMENT PLANE PLUMMETED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FEET MAYBE SOMETHING COULD'VE GONE OFF THEN WE MAYBE SOMETHING THAT ONCE THE PLANE MAKES HIM BACK LIKE THE BEACON SHOULD FLOAT TO THE SURFACE OF THE WHITE OR NOT GET STUCK UNDER THE WATER AND IT GETS STUCK UNDER MY BED AT THE OCEAN BED
SO I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER MORE OF THESE THINGS MAYBE CHANGING THE SIGNAL SO IT CAN BE PICKED UP MORE EASILY BAY SEARCH VESSELS LIKE THE PLANES IN THE VICINITY BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR IMAGE THROUGH SEVENTY THEY WERE CUNTS CONFUSING WE'LL SIGNALS FOR THE BLACK BLACKBUCK SIGNALS OR EMERGENCY LOOKING SIGNALLED AND WHAT IS IT THAT STOPS THAT HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT OWEN WHY DON'T THE AIRLINE'S CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES IT COST OR WAD FOR EXAMPLE
THEIR CURRENT SITUATION READY CHECK THE PLANE EVERY TWENTY MINUTES I THINK THEY CAN TRACK THE PLANE EVERY FIVE MINUTES FOR SOMETHING LIKE FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE A REASON FOR THE COST MAYBE A REASON I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO HOLD BACK ON TRACKING SO IS THAT SOMETHING DO YOU THINK WE'VE ALL GOT TO CONCENTRATE ON AND THE AIRLINES HAVE GOT TO CONCENTRATE ON FINDING A WAY
OF MAKING SURE THAT INFORMATION IS IS HELD IN A PLACE THAT ISN'T ON THE AIRCRAFT BASICALLY YEAH I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE DEFINITELY SOMETHING DONE ABOUT WHERE THE INFORMATION IS HELD AND THEY ALSO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MUCH HUMAN INTERVENTION SHOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE PLANE WHEN IT COMES TO TURNING SIGNALS ARE FOR TURNING CERTAIN THINGS I'VE SAID AND ELECTRONICS OFF ON THE BLINK AND SHOULD JUST POSSIBLY ALLOW LESS HUMAN INTERVENTION IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY GROSSED NATHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
AS I SAY DAVID LEMMON OPERATIONS AND SAFETY EDITOR OF FLIGHT TO GLOBAL AN EXPERT ON AVIATION FOR MANY A YEAR IS HERE WITH US GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JUST JUST TO PICK UP ON THE POINTS THAT GRACE NATHAN WAS MAKING FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE RELEVANT IN THIS CASE MIGHT THERE WE ARE SENDING SHIPS OUT TO LOOK NOW FOR THE BLACK BOX WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THAT IT'S A PARTICULARLY DEEP BIT OF THE END OF THE MEDITERRANEAN MIGHT BE DIFFICULT
FIND IT IT FEELS OLD FASHIONED IN A WAY THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THIS FOR THIS THING IN THE SEA YES YOU'RE RIGHT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A CONSTANT STREAMING IS OUT THERE BUT CONSTANT STREAMING OF DATA FROM THE AIRCRAFT IS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND THE FIVE MINUTE IDEA THAT WAS JUST EXPRESSED WAS
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THESE ARE THESE AUTOMATIC THINGS THAT APPEAR EXACTLY AJIT JUST SQUIRT DATE DATA CONCENTRATED DATA SQUIRTED OUT EVERY FIVE MINUTES SO THAT'S DOABLE AND THAT IS DOABLE AT THE MOMENT BUT IT IS NOT IT IS NOT BEEN MADE COMPULSORY SOME AIRLINES HAVE ELECTED TO USE IT SO IT SO THAT
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THING THAT THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED THEN AND THAT IS WHY DOESN'T THE WORK WHY DON'T THE BLACK BOXES AND EJECT THEMSELVES ON IMPACT WITH THE SEA OR WHATEVER AND FLOAT WELL AS MATTER OF FACT THE MILITARY USED TO DO THAT AND THEY'VE NOW ABANDONED IT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THE FLIGHT DATA RECORDERS OCCASIONALLY THERE'S A STIMULUS AND AND IT GETS EJECTED IN FLIGHT SO YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE ANY LONGER SO THEY HAVE DECIDED NOT TO DO IT FOR THAT
FOR THAT REASON UNTIL THEY COME UP WITH A BETTER SYSTEM OH LESS TIME TO WHAT'S BEING SAID ABOUT THE EGYPT AIRPLANE THESE REPORTS OF SMOKE AND A COCKPIT WINDOW OPENING ET-CETERA WE HEARD MIGHT BE HAVE BEEN YOU WERE LISTENING I MIGHT BE A BIT LIKE WOMEN EARLIER BEING PRETTY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THEM WHAT DO YOU MAKE WELL I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A SCREEN SHOT OF THE OF THE PRINT OUTS OF THIS AND I THINK IT'S REAL THE OTHER THING ABOUT AVIATION HERALD I AM FAMILIAR WITH THEM AND THEY ARE A VERY REPUTABLE
YOU KNOW ORGANISE THIS IS THE WEBSITE WHERE THERE'S A WEBSITE WHERE WHICH ACTUALLY BROKE THIS NEWS THE BASICALLY WHAT IT TELLS US THE PRINT OUTS AND AS MIKE VIVIEN SAID IT'S IN A KIND OF A CODE
IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE INDUSTRY PROBABLY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT I'VE HAD A LOOK AT IT AND BASICALLY THERE'S A REPORT OF SMOKE IN THE FORWARD LAVATORY A MINUTE LATER THERE'S SMOKE IN THE ABBEY ONYX BAIT WHICH IS VERY WORRYING AND THEN TWO MINUTES LATER THE FLIGHT CONTROL COMPUTERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER START TO FAIL NOW THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE LEFT WITH IS
IS THIS DID THIS START WITH AN ORDINARY ELECTRICAL FAULT TO SHORT CIRCUIT WHICH STARTED THE FIRE OR WAS THE FIRE STARTED DELIBERATELY WITH A SMALL EXPLOSION OR AN INCENDIARY DEVICE SO IT COULD STILL BE TERRORISM
BUT BUT THE AIRCRAFT IT LOOKS AS IF THE AIRCRAFT WENT OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE THE CONTROLS WERE LITERALLY BURNING OUT SO THERE WASN'T A BOMB THAT PUNCH OF THE FUSELAGE SHIPPED IT WOULD SEEM WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT INFORMATION ON THAT DIDN'T PROPERLY GO OFF AS WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT ACTUALLY JUST IN THIS THIS THIS DEVICE THAT
SENT THIS INFORMATION AND THAT INDICATES TO YOU THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO ENGINEERING BASES THAT'S A SYSTEM CALLED A. CARS I WON'T TRANSLATE IT FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING EXTRA BUT IT'S A SYSTEM FOR REPORTING AIRCRAFT HEALTH BACK TO BASE
IT'S BEEN USED FOR YEARS IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA IT DOESN'T TRANSMIT AIRCRAFT POSITION IT JUST TRANSMITS LITERALLY THE HEALTH OF THE AEROPLANE SO SO THAT INFORMATION'S AVAILABLE AT THE AIR FRANCE FOUR FOUR SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE OF AIR FRANCE AIRCRAFT LOST IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC WE GOT A LITTLE SQUIRT OF INFORMATION THROUGH A CARS THEN WHICH TOLD US WHAT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WAS
AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS TIME WE HAVE GOT THE BEGINNING OF A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WHICH LOOKS AS IF IT'S THE ANSWER TO WHAT HAPPENED BUT WE DON'T KNOW WITH A TERRORISM STARTED THIS OR WHETHER IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL FAULT DAVID LEE AMOUNT FROM MY FLY CLEVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS TWENTY PAST EIGHT NOW OR E. CIGARETTES A MIRACLE OR A MENACE SHOULD VAPOUR ENCOURAGED AS A WAY TO HELP MILLIONS BREAK THEIR LETHAL NICOTINE HABIT OR DISCOURAGED AS A DANGEROUS APPARENTLY SAFE ROUTE INTO SMOKING THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH B.B.C. TWO'S HORIZON HAS SET OUT TO ANSWER
SOMEBODY UNKNOWN CHIPS AND MY FRIEND IF YOU BRING NOW WE HAVE IT'S HUMAN EXPERIMENTS GOING ON RIGHT NOW
THEY COULD TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PERHAPS THE GREATEST EVEN PUBLIC HEALTH INNOVATION
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS WILL BE
I THINK THEY ARE A GAME CHANGER AND ARE VERY EXCITED BY
WE JOIN ON THE LINE BUT THE REPORT ON THAT PROGRAMME HORIZONS MICHAEL MOSLEY JOINS US FROM NEWCASTLE MORNING TO YOU MICHAEL GOOD MORNING TO YOU HI NOW INTREPID YOU CLEARLY ARE BECAUSE YOU SPENT A MONTH PEEPING YOURSELF EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A NON SMOKER WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT RIGHT WHAT WE WERE INTERESTED IN WAS WHETHER ALL THE EFFECT ON THE BODY IN THE MIND OF
NON SMOKERS TAKING UP THEY PING BECAUSE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE ANXIETIES BEFORE THIS I'D NOT HAD EVEN A SINGLE CIGARETTE SO THE PRODUCERS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE QUITE AMUSING IF I STARTED OFF BY HAVING A CIGARETTE AND I DO HAVE AN AWFUL LOT ARE COUGHING AND THEN UP BEGAN AS THE REGIME OF FOUR WEEKS WHERE I HAD TO TAKE UP HEAVY RAPING AND HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL I WAS ACTUALLY ALL RIGHT IN FACT
I'VE YOU KNOW AS I SAID NO I HAVE NO BASIS FOR COMPARISON BUT IT WAS LIKE HAVING A STRONG COFFEE EXCEPT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY MY ANXIETY AND MY WIFE IS A G.P. WAS ALSO VERY ANXIOUS THAT I WOULD BECOME ADDICTED TO THIS HORRIBLE HABIT
AND ACTUALLY AT THE END THE MONTH OBEY HAPPILY HANDED OVER BACK TO RESEARCHERS AND HAVE NEVER TEMPTED TO HAVE ANOTHER PUFF AGAIN AND YOU MUST HAVE DONE THE TESTS HAVE GOT DOCTORS DO THE TEST WAS HER ANY LONG TERM IMPACT ON YOUR BODY THERE WAS A VERY MILD INFORMATION IN MY LUNGS WHICH WENT AWAY ALMOST STRAIGHT AWAY SO I THINK NOBODY'S SAYING THEY PING IS A GOOD THING IF YOU'RE A NON SMOKER BUT WE WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE RESEARCH ON WHETHER PEOPLE WHO VAIT
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT UP AND ALSO WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW BAD IS IT COMPARED TO SMOKY AND THAT WAS KIND OF ONE THE QUESTIONS THE ALTERNATIVE TO VERY BIG IT'S A SORT OF COLD TURKEY ISN'T IS IS SIMPLY TRYING TO STOP ARE YOU CONVINCED THAT VAPOUR HE'S JUST A MUCH EASIER MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE REALLY BAD STUFF I AM AND THAT'S THAT
NOT BEEN ENOUGH GOOD STUDIES YET THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW RANDOMISED MY STUDIES BUT FOR HORIZON WE CONDUCTED OUR OWN STUDY WE GOT TOGETHER A HARDCORE OF REALLY DETERMINED SMOKERS THEY'VE BEEN SPOKEN TWENTY OR THIRTY A DAY FOR TWENTY YEARS TRIED TO GIVE UP MANY TIMES FAILED AND WE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED THEM WITH HELP FROM OXFORD UNIVERSITY IN LONDON UNIVERSITY TO EITHER GOING VERY PING
NICOTINE PATCHES OR TRY AND COLD TURKEY AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THE NICOTINE PATCHES AND THE VAPOURS HAD A MUCH HIGHER SUCCESS RATE OVER THE OVER THE MONTH THAT WE WERE DOING IT AND WE WANT TO FOLLOW THEM UP FOR LONGER BRIEF LAST ONE IF YOU WERE THAT THEY HAVE THE FEAR I SUPPOSE HAVE SOME IS THAT YES IT MIGHT HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE SMOKERS BUT HE MAY NORMALISE THE IDEA OF SMOKING REV HAVING SOMETHING IN YOUR MOUTH AS IT WERE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER SMOKED AT ALL PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG
ABSOLUTELY NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO PREVENT THEM BIG ADVERTISED OR SOLD BUT AT THE MOMENT THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT NINETY NINE POINT NINE EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO'VE EIGHT A FORMER SMOKER'S POINT NOUGHT TWO PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED IT WHO ARE NOT SMOKERS NOT APPEAR TO BE WRITTEN NOT A LOT MARK AMAZING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MICHAEL'S PROGRAMME HORIZON PROGRAMME IS ON SUNDAY ON B.B.C. TWO OR OF COURSE YOU CAN GET IT ON I PLAY PLAYER LATER
TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW AND IT IS A VERY BIG DAY OF SPORT AND GARY IS HERE WITH US ALREADY MORNING GANG MORNING HAVE YOU NOTICED THERE'S A SCARF ON THE PEG OVER THERE IT'S A BLACK EYE I WAS LUCKY AWAY FROM ELECTION NEXT YOUR SHOE BACK NUP NUP NOT ONLY IS THERE A SCARF THEY WERE IN BE TALKING ABOUT IT
HE'S HOLDING UP A SHIRT WITH HIS NAME ON THE BACK THAT SAYS FIFTY IS THAT IS THE SIZE OF HIS WASTE A SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY YES YOU'RE SPOT ON THE CUP FOOTBALL TEST CRICKET BIG MATCHES IN RUGBY UNION RUGBY LEAGUE TEATIME KICK OFF AT WEMBLEY WHERE MANCHESTER UNITED PLAY CRYSTAL PALACE ART CORRESPONDENT JOHN MURRAY WILL BE PROVIDING COMMENTARY FROM HALF PAST FIVE
IN CRYSTAL PALACE'S ONLY PREVIOUS F.A. CUP FINAL IN NINETEEN NINETY THEY LOST OUT TO MANCHESTER UNITED WHOSE FIRST TROPHY SUCCESS IT WAS UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF ALEX FERGUSON NOW AN F.A. CUP FINAL AGAINST CRYSTAL PALACE MIGHT PROVIDE UNITED'S FIRST MAJOR TROPHY VICTORY SINCE ALEX'S RETIREMENT THREE YEARS AGO BUT IF THEY DO WIN IT IT'S FAR FROM CLEAR IF THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAVE THE JOB OF THE CURRENT MANAGER LOUIS VAN GUY
HIS OPPOSITE NUMBER TODAY ALAN DO YOU PLAYED FOR PALACE IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FINAL AND IN THE SEASON LEICESTER CITY BECAME CHAMPIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME WERE PART DUE TO KITE PALACE TO THEIR FIRST MAJOR TROPHY THAT WOULD BE QUITE A DOUBLE
SO LET'S LISTEN TO THE CRYSTAL PALACE MANAGER ALAN PARTY I FEEL THE WAY YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY THAT WE HAVE LOST NOT WINNING SOMETHING
IT'S A CLUB THAT HAS A CERTAIN THE KNIFE AND IT WOULD BE NICE I THINK IT'LL BE GOOD FOR FOOTBALL FOR HIS CLUB TO WIN
I THINK WE'RE QUITE EXCITED TO MOTHER THE SECOND HALF THE SEASON UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T QUITE REACHED THOSE HIGHER TOUGHER THAN IN THIS COMPETITION
SO ONE MORE GUY FIFTH PREMIER LEAGUE TEAM WE BEAT AND WE WIN
IN A DIFFICULT SEASON FOR MANCHESTER UNITED MANAGER LUV I'M GIRL HE BELIEVES THAT WINNING THE CUP TODAY WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN QUALIFYING FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PLAYERS THE COURSE A QUALIFICATION IT'S NOT A TITLE
THEY CAME LOOK THEY CAME HALT THE CAR
A CLOCK LIKE THIS IS NO IT'S SILVER WELL EVEN IF MANCHESTER UNITED DO WIN THE CUP TODAY THE SPORTS AGENDA DURING THIS COMING WEEK WILL BE DOMINATED BY HIS FUTURE SHOULD UNITED DECIDE TO END HIS CONTRACT FORMER PLAYER OLLIE GONNA SOLVE CHARLES HAS THAT RYAN GIGGS WOULD BE A GOOD REPLACEMENT
RYAN'S GOT MAN UNITED D.N.A. YES I THINK HE'S BEING BLOODED THAT'S A FUTURE MANAGER AND I KNOW GIGGSY REALLY WELL OF COURSE THROUGH OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER WE DID A COACHING COURSES TOGETHER SO YES DEFINITELY HE WOULD WOULD DO A GOOD JOB OF MONEY I DID AS WELL

EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS ARE TO EXAMINE FRESH DATA FROM THE PASSENGER PLANE WHICH CRASHED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ON THURSDAY AND AVIATION WEBSITE SAYS SMOKE WAS DETECTED IN THE TOILET THE AIRCRAFT'S ELECTRICS JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE SIGNAL WAS LAST ALL SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD WHO WERE FLYING FROM PARIS TO CAIRO ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED THE AVIATION EXPERT DAVID LEE AMOUNT TOLD US THAT THE DATA WAS CONSISTENT WITH EITHER AN ELECTRICAL FAULT OR TERRORISM
EUROSCEPTIC CAMPAIGNERS HAVE DISMISSED A WARNING BY THE CHANCELLOR THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE HOUSE PRICES COULD BE UP TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT LOWER IN TWO YEARS' TIME THE ENERGY MINISTER AND VOTE LEAVE SUPPORTER ANDREA LEAD SOME SAID MISTER OSBORNE'S CLAIM WAS EXTRAORDINARY
LABOUR WILL SET OUT ITS APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY AND TACKLING THE HOUSING CRISIS TODAY BUT THE NEWLY ELECTED LABOUR MAYOR OF LONDON HAS REJECTED ITS IDEA OF GIVING NEW POWERS TO COUNCILS TO REGULATE PRIVATE RENTS IN THEIR AREAS THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND IS TO DECIDE ON WHETHER TO ALLOW ITS MINISTERS TO BE IN SAME SEX MARRIAGES TODAY'S VOTE OF THE KIRK'S ANNUAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN EDINBURGH COMES A YEAR AFTER THE CHURCH AGREED THAT MINISTERS COULD ENTER INTO CIVIL PARTNERSHIPS
THANK YOU KATHY IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE IT'S THE CANARY IN THE MINE AND EARLY WARNING A SIGN OF A LOOMING DISASTER SO SAID THE HEAD OF THE ORGANISATION WHICH REPRESENTS N.H.S. HOSPITAL TRUSTS ON THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE HEALTH SERVICES RECORD DEFICIT AND THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BALANCE THEIR BOOKS THIS YEAR HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND THAT IS MANY N.H.S. INSIDERS BELIEVE THE SYSTEM WILL SOON SIMPLY BE UNABLE TO COPE
WITH THE PRESSURES ON IT EVEN WITH THE PROMISES OF A YEAR ON YEAR INCREASES IN SPENDING THE MONEY USED TO RUN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS SIR DAVID NICHOLSON AND HE JOINS US NOW ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU SIR DAVID GOOD MORNING THEY SHOULD THESE FIGURES BE SEEN AS A WAKE UP CALL
I THINK THESE FIGURES HAVE BEEN COMING FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THE ELECTION WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE N.H.S. AND IF THEY WEREN'T ADDRESSED THEY WOULD GET WORSE AND THE FIGURES THAT WE HAVE I THINK IT'S JUST OVER TWO POINT FOUR BILLION IN TERMS OF THE PROVIDED DEFICIT THAT'S PROBABLY AN UNDERESTIMATION WE PROBABLY THINK THAT THE REAL UNDERLYING DEFICIT IS ABOUT THREE BIT THREE BILLION AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST YEAR THAT THREE BILLION PROBLEM WILL ROLL INTO THIS YEAR INTO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SO IT CREATES A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR HOSPITALS AND PROVIDE ORGANISATION AND YET YEAR IN YEAR OUT WE HEAR OF PROBLEMS THAT TREASURY FINDS A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY BEHIND THE SOFA IS THIS ONE OF THOSE YEARS IN WHICH A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA CASH WILL GET US OUT OF THE PROBLEM OR SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL GOING ON
I THINK WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED HERE IS THAT RIGHT UP TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ON AVERAGE THE N.H.S. GOT ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF PER CENT GROWTH EVERY YEAR FROM NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES GOT IT THAT'S BUT THAT WAS GENERALLY THE POSITION
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH THE FINANCIAL CRASH AND AUSTERITY THE N.H.S. IS ESSENTIALLY GOT LITTLE OR NO GROWTH DURING THAT PERIOD AND THERE ISN'T A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I DON'T THINK IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD THAT CAN COPE IN THE LONG TERM WITH LITTLE OR NO GROWTH EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAVE GIVEN ABOUT TWO PER CENT INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT'S HALF OF WHAT THE LONG TERM
COULD BE AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT CREATES A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE H. S. NOT THAT IT'LL FALL OVER BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE PRESSURE WILL GET GREATER THE PRESSURE ON OUR STAFF GETS GREATER AND GREATER WAITING TIMES WILL START TO GET LONGER AND PEOPLE WILL START TO TAKE SHORT TERM ACTION WHICH WILL BE IN THE LONG TERM DETRIMENT FOR THE SERVICE
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
PEOPLE WILL DO IS THAT THEY WILL LET WAITING TIME'S RUN OUT AND MY EXPERIENCE OF HAVING WORKED THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DELIVERING THE EIGHTEEN WEEK GUARANTEE IS THAT IT TAKES TWO THIRDS OF THE G.D.P. OF THE COUNTRY TO GET CUTE AWAY SHORTER WAITING TIME YOU CAN LET IT RUN OUT IF YOU SAY VERY LITTLE BUT ACTUALLY
HE WILL HAVE TO SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS TO GET IT BACK INTO PLACE SO YOU ESSENTIALLY A PATIENT'S WAITING FOR LONGER GETTING LESS OF A SERVICE YOU HAVE WORKERS WORKING FOR LESS MONEY OVER TIME AND WORKING HARDER NOW THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THIS WAS MEANT TO BE EFFICIENCY WHEN YOU WERE IN CHARGE IT WAS CALLED THE NICHOLSON CHALLENGE WASN'T IT THE IDEA THE BILLIONS COULD BE RELEASED NOT MERELY FROM SO CALLED EFFICIENCIES FROM PAPERCLIPS BUT BY REORGANISING THE N.H.S. CLOSING SERVICES TAKING UNPOPULAR DECISIONS TO CENTRALISE IS THAT NOT THE ANSWER
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD SAY IS THE PRESSURES FACING THE N.H.S. AT THE MOMENT OF THE SAME PRESSURES THAT ARE AFFECTING ALMOST ANY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD SO WET WHETHER YOU'RE IN FRANCE GERMANY SWEDEN DENMARK ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE SUFFERING THE SAME KINDS OF CHALLENGERS AMI ANSWER TO THEM THE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING THREE FAULT FIRST OF ALL THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE GET PATIENTS AND PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO ABLE TO DO THAT
PEOPLE INVESTING HEAVILY IN PRIMARY CARE AND THIRDLY THEY ARE CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH HOSPITAL SERVICES ARE DELIVERED THE FIRST TWO GENERALLY SPEAKING GET LOTS OF SUPPORT A LOT A LOT OF ACCLAMATION THE THIRD ONE IS MORE TO EVEN WATCH MORE COMPLICATED AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DO CHRIS HOBSON WHO RUNS N.H.S. PROVIDERS HE WAS ON THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY WE WERE QUOTING HIM
ARGUES IN THE TIMES TODAY ASKED THIS QUESTION DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO KEEP OPEN TO ANY DEPARTMENT ONLY FORTY MILES APART WHEN THEY'RE SO POORLY STAFFED IN OTHER WORDS IS IT TIME TO START MAKING CLOSURES WHICH WILL BE DESPERATELY UNPOPULAR LOCALLY DO YOU THINK IT IS TIME OVER HIS NOTE NO DOUBT HIM IN MY MIND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE COUNTRIES GERMANY DENMARK FRANCE THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT IN SECONDARY CARE IN HOSPITAL SERVICES THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO SHIFT
RESOURCES INTO PRIMARY COMMUNITY CARE AND SIMILAR YOU NEED TO DO THAT HERE AS I SAY THAT A YOU BECAUSE EVEN IF THE LANGUAGE OF SEVEN SECONDS IT CAN CAN PLOT USED BEETS YOU ARE SAYING TO PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME ARE YOU YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT IT MIGHT BE SENSIBLE IT MAY BE GOOD TO CLOSE YOUR LOCAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY TO MERGE MANY LOCAL HOSPITAL SERVICES TOUGH THAT IS THE WAY TO GET A BETTER N.H.S. I THINK
THE THING I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT IS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE YEARS ANYWAY WHAT WE NEED IS THE ACCELERATION OF THAT SO IF YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE STROKE SERVICE AS WE'VE SEEN THAT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ORGANISATIONS THAT PROVIDE STROKE SERVICES CONCENTRATING THE EXPERTISE IN A SMALLER GROUP OF HOSPITALS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS IF YOU LOOK AT MADE IT MAJOR TRAUMA SERVICE AS WHERE WE'VE CONCENTRATE AND CENTRALISED THEM IN A SMALLER NUMBER OF HOSPITALS WE HAVE IMPROVED
IT'S THE FIRST SURVIVOR SHIP OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS AND I THINK WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THAT AND INDEED WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT IN THE N.H.S. IS PEEPER EXPLORING THESE ISSUES AS PART OF A SERVICE TRANSFORMATION PLAN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE CENTRALISED BECAUSE IN THIS VOTE TO THE FASHION IS TO PUSH THESE DECISIONS DOWN TO MAY HAVE THEM TAKE MORE LOCALLY ARGUABLY WILL NEVER BE TAKEN LOCALLY BECAUSE THEY'LL ALWAYS BE UNPOPULAR AND IT DOES TAKE SOMEONE AT THE SENTENCE
IT IS TOUGH TO SAY BUT THESE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND BETTER IF THEY'RE CENTRALISED AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR YOU THE LAST TIME I APPEARED ON THIS PROGRAMME WAS DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN WHEN I WAS REALLY CONCERNED THAT THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE TAKEN DURING THIS PARLIAMENT BUT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN THE LABOUR PARTY OR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME AND PEOPLE LOCALLY CAN GET ON AND DO THINGS BUT THEY NEED TO AN ENVIRONMENT CREATED WHERE THE PUBLIC START TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO CHANGE SERVICES IN ORDER TO CREATE A HIGH QUALITY SUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE N.H.S. I'M GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY I GUESS YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN WE'RE NOT ON THE ELECTION
PUT IT AS IN AS UNPOPULAR WAY AS YOU CAN WHAT IS IT THAT THE COUNTRY NOW HAS TO BE PREPARED TO FACE UP TO IF WE ARE NOT MERELY TO HAVE PATIENTS GETTING WORSE SERVICES AN N.H.S. WORKERS HAVING A WORSE LESS WELL REWARDED LIFE
O.K. THE FIRST THING IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON HEALTH CARE THROUGH THE TAXATION SYSTEM YOU SEE THERE A CHOICE OF PRIORITIES FOR A GOVERNMENT OR ITS INCREASED TAXES THERE SEEMS TO ME WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE DOING IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT'S THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE SO WE NEED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON ON HEALTH CARE AND SECONDLY
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DELIVER SERVICES PEOPLE FEWER PEOPLE NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AND WE NEED TO CREATE SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN PREVENT ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN HOSPITAL GET OUT OF HOSPITAL AS FAST AS POTTY AS POSSIBLE THAT MEANS SMALL HOSPITALS AND SMALLER INVESTMENT IN SECONDARY IN HOSPITAL CARE A FINER ONE YOU TWEETED DURING THE JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT END OF COURSE JUNIOR DOCTORS MAY REJECT THE AGREED CONTRACT IN A BALLET SOON YOU SAID THE IMPOSITION OF THE JUNIOR DOCTORS CONTRACT OR NO EMERGENCY COVER IS A CATASTROPHE SO LARGE FOR THE N.H.S. YOU CAN SEE IT FROM SPACE
HOW BAD HIS MORALE IN THE N.H.S. AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I WOULD SAY WHEN I STARTED IN THE N.H.S. IN THE MID SEVENTIES MY BOSS SAID TO ME ANYTHING THAT GOOD HAPPENS IN THE N.H.S. WE'RE DOWN TO DOCTORS AND NURSES ANYTHING BAD THAT HAPPENS IN THE N.H.S. WILL BE YOUR FAULT OR MORALE HAS NEVER BEEN LOWER SO THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT EVEN EVEN EVEN TODAY WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE IS THAT
THIS IS A GENERATION OF DOCTORS WHO WILL RECREATE THE N.H.S. THEY OR DIFFERENT TO THE DOCTORS OF THE OF THE PAST THEY'RE MORE SKILL THEY WANTED WORK MORE FLEXIBLY THEY WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR THEIR OWN THEIR OWN THEIR OWN LIVES THE N.H.S. NEEDS TO ADAPT TO THAT AND ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT THEM AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WAY THE CONVERSATION WAS GOING THAT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND I WAS REALLY WORRIED THAT IT WAS LESS TO DO WITH
THOUGH IT IS THE ISSUES AROUND THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM ARE MORE TO DO A GENERAL IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE NEED TO PUT THE JUNIOR DOCTORS IN THEIR PLACE WOULD SEEM TO BE COMPLETELY THE WRONG PLAY EXACTLY THE HEALTH SECRETARY GOT IT
AND WHAT THE HEALTH SECRETARY IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION OF OF OF JUNIOR DOCTOR JUNIOR DOCTORS HOURS CLEAVER THE GOVERNMENT OVERALL COT IT WRONG TO DAVID NICHOLLS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
NINETY MINUTES TO NINE AUSTRIA COULD BE ABOUT TO ELECT THE EAVES FIRST EVER HARD RIGHT HEAD OF STATE IN THE SECOND ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY NORBERT HALFA THE CANDIDATE OF THE FAR RIGHT FREEDOM PARTY WHICH ONE THE POLES FIRST ROUND WITH MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE IN APRIL IS GOING TO FACE OFF AGAINST HIS INDEPENDENT RIVAL ALEXANDER VANDA BELLAMY'S A MEMBER OF THE GREEN PARTY WHO TOOK JUST OVER TWENTY ONE PER CENT SO WHO IS NORBERT OVER EUROPE REPORTER CAVALIER HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT OF AUSTRIA'S FINAL TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE THE TWO CANDIDATES SIT FACE TO FACE NEITHER FROM THE TRADITIONAL MIDDLE GROUND PARTIES BUT HAVE LONG RULED IN ULSTER
ALEXANDER'S UNDERBELLY AND USED TO LEAD THE GREEN PARTY AND IS NOW STANDING AS AN INDEPENDENT BUT IT'S THE EVER SMILING AND SOFTLY SPOKEN THOMAS HOOFER THAT'S CATCHING WIDER ATTENTION ACROSS EUROPE
THE LEADER OF THE POPULIST FREEDOM PARTY ONCE RELEGATED TO THE FAR RIGHT FRINGES IS FAVOURITE TO BECOME HEAD OF STATE WITH A MANTRA OF AUSTRIA FIRST AND THE CATCHPHRASE I TELL IT LIKE IT IS AND IF YOU SEE HONESTLY MICHE STUCK IF YOU TRUST MY VISION IS FOR A STRONG ECONOMY
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND SECURITY IT'S WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THE WOMEN OF VIENNA BEING AFRAID TO WALK THE STREETS I WANTS PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY ITALY CITY
HAS GAINED WIDE SUPPORT WINNING THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE VOTE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HE'S THE ANTI ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATE WHO SAYS HE REALLY LISTENS TO VOTERS AND CAMPAIGNS ON A MIGRANT CURBING NATIONALIST YOU'RE A SCEPTIC TICKET ONE OF HIS CHIEF SUPPORTERS IS DOCTOR ANDREAS RABBLE THE FREEDOM PARTY'S MARE IN THE AUSTRIAN TOWN OF BELLS THEY CAN'T RACE DIDN'T GET UP HE PICKED TO MICHAEL IT'S THE WAY HE GOES ABOUT HIS POLITICS
VOTERS WANT POLITICIANS WHO ARE PRAGMATIC TO ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT CHANGE PEOPLE WHO TACKLE PROBLEMS HEAD ON AND ARE NOT HELD BACK BY TABOOS OR MAINSTREAM THINKING THAT'S WHY THE FREEDOM PARTY HAS HAD SO MUCH ELECTORAL SUCCESS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK HOPEFULLY WILL BE ELECTED BECAUSE PEOPLE TRUST HIM TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AND CHANGE THING US
OUTSIDE THE T.V. STUDIO IN VIENNA'S MAIN SQUARE HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS ARE CALLING ON FELLOW AUSTRIANS TO WAKE UP THEY CLAIM THE FREEDOM PARTY IS A SINISTER AS EVER SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE FREEDOM PARTY FIRST JOINED THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT IT LED TO A HUGE OUTCRY SEVERAL E.U. COUNTRIES EVEN IMPOSED SANCTIONS NOW THE RESPONSE IS MUTED POPULIST RIGHT WING MOVEMENTS ARE BECOMING MORE COMMON ACROSS THE CONCERT
IN THE CAFES OF VIENNA THEY'RE WATCHING THE CHANGING POLITICAL TIMES THOMAS SOFA AN AUSTRIAN POLITICAL ADVISER CLAIMS THE INCREDIBLE RISE OF THE PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE A YEAR AGO BUT THAT THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF IT HAS CHANGED ALL THAT THE FREEDOM PARTY WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL
BUILDING THEIR AGENDA OVER THE YEARS ANTI EUROPEAN FEELINGS AND MIGRATION POLICY
AND RIGHT NOW OF COURSE THEY BENEFITING FROM THAT BECAUSE THE REFUGEE CRISIS PLAYS INTO THEIR HANDS
I THINK IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE STRENGTH OF THE FREEDOM PARTY THAT MAKES THEM STRONG BUT THE WEAKNESS OF THE REIGNING PARTY
I THINK I'LL THEN ADDS TO EMPATHISE ESTABLISHMENT FEELING AMONGST THE ARTERY POPULATION AUSTRIA'S FORMER ENVOY TO THE E.U. WOLFGANG PETRA ITCH PREDICTS THAT NORBERT HOOFER WILL MAKE HISTORY TOMORROW NIGHT AND WE'LL BE ELECTED HEAD OF STATE HE SAYS THE APPEAL OF THIS FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD HARDLINER
IT'S HIS CHARISMA TO NICE FACE WHERE A TRAIN TRAINED ABOUT VERY MUCH ROOTED IN
ALL NATIONALITIES AND AUTHORITARIAN TRENDS AND PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL THAT VOTING FOR HIS PROTEST ANY LONGER
IT IS A NATURAL THING TO DO IN THEIR LIES TO DANGER
TIME NO IT'S A QUARTER TO NINE IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AGAIN SPECULATION CONTINUES ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE EGYPT AIR CRASH TWO DAYS AGO THE SUN HINTS AT A POSSIBLE LINK WITH THE PARAS BOMBINGS IN NOVEMBER REPORTING THE FOURTH OR MILITANTS VISITED CHILLS TO GO AIRPORT TWO HOURS BEFORE THE ATTACKS OR POLICE OR SAYS IT'S FEARED THEY WERE COORDINATING WITH COMRADES THERE
THE TELEGRAPH DESCRIBED HOW HEAVILY ARMED TROOPS ARE PATROLLING THE TERMINALS AS GROUND STAFF ARE BEING QUESTIONED EEJIT DES VICE PRESIDENT TELLS THE PAPER THAT IT OFTEN TAKES YEARS TO ESTABLISH THEIR PROBABLE CAUSE AND THAT SOME CASES ON NEVER RESOLVED DID COCKPIT STRUGGLE LEAD TO JET DISASTER ASK THE DAILY EXPRESS WHICH QUOTES OF BRITISH AVIATION EXPERT AS POINTING TO INTERFERENCE ON THE FLIGHT DECK THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION
FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT PENSION FUNDS COULD BE LOSING MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR VALUE TO LEGAL AND BANK CHARGES MANY OF THEM ARE HIDDEN THE F. T. SAYS FINANCIAL AND LEGAL EXPERTS ARE FAR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TYPES OF THESE BEING APPLIED TO PENSION SCHEMES WHICH THEY SAY ARE LEADING TO CONFUSION THE ASSOCIATION OF BRITISH INSURERS INSIST THAT IT'S WORKING TO MAKE INVESTMENT COSTS FULLY TRANSPARENT AS THE CHANCELLOR WARNS OF THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE Y. YOU COULD HIT
HOUSE PRICES THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT PROPERTY INVESTORS THERE INCLUDING HER BRICKS IT CLAUSE IN CONTRACTS TO ALLOW THEM TO PULL OUT OF DEALS IF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WINS THE TIMES REPORTS THAT A FORMER ADVISOR TO DAVID CAMERON HAS LAUNCHED A SCATHING ATTACK ON THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGNS ACCUSING BOTH SIDES ARE TREATING VOTERS LIKE SIMPLETONS STEVE HILTON WARNS THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T RESPOND WELL IF THEY MAKE OUTLANDISH CLAIMS OF DIRE OUTCOMES RATHER THAN TAKING A MORE NUANCED APPROACH
HOW MANY IS THAT THE FORMER FRENCH FOOTBALLER DAVID GENERAL HAS HAD A QUADRUPLE HEART BYPASS MAKES QUITE A FEW OF THE PAPERS THE SUN QUOTES HIS SURGEON OR SAYING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BRAIN DEAD IF TWO PEOPLE AT THE CHARITY MATCH WHERE HE COLLAPSED HAVE NOT RESUSCITATED IN THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS IT SHOULD SERVE AS A WARNING TO US ALL THAT CHEST TWINGES SHOULD NEVER BE IGNORED
THE TIME NOW IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE A BRITISH STUDENTS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD WHEN THEY VOLUNTEER TO GO TO POORER COUNTRIES AND TO HELP OUT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN THIS FORM OF TRAVEL STROKE AID AND IT'S VERY MUCH ENCOURAGED BY UNIVERSITIES AND OF COURSE IT'S A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE STUDENTS AND POTENTIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE HELPED IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES BUT DAVID COATES THE COORDINATOR OF VOLUNTEERING AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS HAS CALLED ON OTHER UNIVERSITIES TO JOIN HIM IN STOPPING STUDENTS GOING TO VOLUNTEER IN ORPHANAGES
PARTICULARLY IN SOUTH EAST ASIA AND AFRICA MY COLES IS HERE AND ON THE LINE IS KEY M. LE FAIRE BRIT WHO IS THE SEA THE FOUNDER OF THE GUP A. WHICH IS AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTEERS INCLUDING OCCASIONALLY SOMETIMES WORKING IN ORPHANAGES MORNING TO YOU BOTH THAT DAY BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL SET OUT WHAT IT IS THAT WORRIES YOU
AS YOU SAID IN THAT LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE VOLUNTEERING OVERSEAS THESE DAYS AND THAT IS A GOOD THING WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO AND VOLUNTEER HOWEVER WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS AN HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF AGENCIES AND CHARGING YOUNG BRITISH PEOPLE TO GO AND WORK WITH VULNERABLE CHILDREN OVERSEAS AND THESE ORGANISATIONS AREN'T TIME BACKGROUND CHECKS
ON THESE PEOPLE NOT DECIDING WHO'S BEST SUITED TO WORK WITH HE'S VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND THIS IS POTENTIALLY CANDY TO INCREASE CHILD TRAFFICKING TO FILL THESE ORPHANAGES FOR OUR VOLUNTEERS TO GO AND WORK IN IT CAN LEAD TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF THESE PEOPLE NOT BEING BACKGROUND CHECKED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PERHAPS IT CAN LEAD TO SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS
IF YOU IMAGINE IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PERSON WITH MY PARENTS LIVING IN RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTRE AND IT'S A CONTINUOUS REVOLVING DOOR OF FOREIGN VOLUNTEERS COMING IN THAT DOESN'T NEED TO PRODUCTIVE CHILDHOOD DO YOU ACTUALLY SUGGESTING THAT THE FIRST OF THOSE THINGS THAT SOME OF THESE ORPHANAGES ARE FILLED
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOMEWHERE FOR THE VOLUNTEERS TO GO THIS IS BECOME QUITE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MODEL FOR CERTAIN ORGANISATIONS AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN CHILD TRAFFICKING SO
PEOPLE WHO RUN ORPHANAGES WILL GO INTO POOR AREAS NORMALLY ROLL AREAS PARTICULARLY SEEING US IN CAMBODIA AND SELLING THEIR FAMILIES ARE SORT OF A BIT OF A LIE SAYING COME SEND YOUR CHILD AT ALL ORPHANAGES WE HAVE OVERSEAS TEACHER'S COMING TO WORK WITH THESE CHILDREN THEY'RE BETTER OFF NOT BEING WITH YOU BEING IN THESE RESIDENTIAL CARE CENTRE WILL HAVE FOREVER KERSH KIT SHOULD IT EVER HAPPEN CAN IT EVER HAPPENED SAFELY AND PROPERLY
AH YES I THINK WHAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT FIRST OF ALL I DO EXCEPT SUMMER IT'S ON OF THOSE POINTS AROUND
NOT EVERY AGENCY OR NOT EVERY IMAGE IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ABOVE BOARD BUT A BLANKET BAN WOULD WHICH GO TOO FAR I CAN ONLY TALK FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW AND AS A U.K. BASED CHARITY WHO RUNS THIS WHAT WE DO IS WE DO A BACKGROUND CHECKS PROPERLY WE ONLY WORK WITH ORPHANAGES WHERE WE ARE SURE
THAT OUR VOLUNTEERS WILL BE USED PROPERLY AND I THINK THAT'S IN THOSE INSTANCES WE DO YOU SEE A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT BASE TO THE ORPHANAGE AS AN ORGANISATION AND ALSO TO THE CHILDREN WHO LISTER I'M SPECIFICALLY WHAT I WOULD SAY IN A MODEL
WHEN A VOLUNTEER PAYS MONEY TO US IN ORDER TO VOLUNTEER IN AFRICA AND MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY MAKES ITS WAY TO THE PLACEMENTS IN WHICH THEY WORK THEREFORE I CAN THINK OF NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF ORPHANAGES HUGH G. VERY GOOD WORK WHO ARE STILL OPEN TODAY BECAUSE OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE WORKED BECAUSE THOSE FEES HAVE HELPED SUPPORT THAT ORGANISATION
I THINK TO SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BLANKET BAN ON AND ALL WESTERN VOLUNTEER IS GOING TO WORK IN ORPHANAGES WE'D ACTUALLY DO IT A LOT OF HARM BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME OF THESE ORGANISATIONS THAT RELY ON THAT STREAM IN ORDER TO EVEN OPERATES AS AN SHE'S NOT A FAIR POINT EVER
AND I DID TAKE THAT POINT WHAT I'D SAY IS ORPHANAGES IN GENERAL ARE AN INTERVENTION WITHOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY WHAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO DO IN THIS IS BACKED UP BY ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS STAVE WHICH SAVE THE CHILDREN U.K. AND UNICEF WHO ARE NOW TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN ORPHANAGES ALL OVER THE WORLD THEY SAY THAT WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS FOR A FAMILY BASED SOLUTIONS A CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION
THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO FAMILY LIFE AND LIVING IN ORPHANAGES NOT HER FAMILY LOVE AND THE OTHER POINT AGAIN AFFAIR IS THAT THE PEOPLE COMING IN I MEAN IN MANY CASES JUST WON'T LOOK LIKE THE CHILDREN WON'T LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEIR WIDER SOCIETY AND IT BUILDS UP THIS THIS ADDED ODDNESS ON TOP OF THE SOMETIMES AWFUL SITUATION THAT THEY'RE ALL ALREADY
OH YES I MEAN AGAIN IN SOME INSTANCES TAKE THAT POINT THAT THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS THAT WOULD BE FROM TEESIDE FROM ONE SIDE THERE ARE GOING TO BE LOTS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE ORPHANAGES WHO ARE GETTING A VERY ROUNDED EDUCATION ABOUT THE WORLD NOT JUST ACADEMIC EDUCATION THEY'RE MEETING PEOPLE WHO THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE MET BEFORE THEIR UNDERSTANDING WAYS OF LICE AND APPROACHES TO LICE THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
THEY SOME OF THE CHILDREN SHOES IF YOU WERE IN THE ORPHANAGES THAT WE WOULD WORK WITH HAVE AS THEIR VOLUNTEERS HAVE KEPT IN CONTACT WITH THEM FOR YEARS AND IT HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND THINGS I DID STATING THEY WOULD WERE EVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE AND THEN FROM THE FLIPSIDE I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES ALWAYS PEOPLE DO FORGET WHICH IS THAT WE ARE BUILDING A YOUNGER GENERATION IN THE U.K. AND THE U.S.
OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE SEEN THESE THINGS FIRST HAND AND THEREFORE WE'RE BUILDING A GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO WHO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PLIGHT OF SAY SOUTH EAST ASIA AND AFRICA AND THAT CAN ONLY BE A GOOD THING FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MOVING FORWARD GRAHAM LOVE EVER AND THEY BECAUSE AS WELL FROM THE L.S.E. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
HAVE YOU HEARD IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. YOUR HOUSE COULD BE KNOCKED DOWN AND REDUCED TO RUBBLE AND IF WE STAY IN THE COUNTRY MAY WELL BE OVER RUN BY A PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS
NO WELL O.K. NO WHAT ACTUALLY MADE THOSE CLAIMS THIS WEEK IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BUT AT TIMES THEY'VE SOUNDED AS IF THEY COMING PRETTY CLOSE
WE BE SO SURE THAT PEACE AND STABILITY ON A CONTINENT ARE ASSURED BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF DOUBT
OVER THE LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS PEOPLE HAVE MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO UNIFY EUROPE BY FORCE
FIVE EIGHT MILLION NEW PEOPLE ARRIVING HERE FOR ME THERE WILL BE A HIT TO THE VALUE OF PEOPLE'S HOMES OF AT LEAST TEN PER CENT UP TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT AND YEAH SCARING US DOES SEEM TO BE THE PRINCIPAL A BOTH THERE REMAIN AND LEAVE SIDES OF THIS DEBATE IT LED AS YOU WERE JUST HEARING STEVE HELP ME USED TO WORK FOR THE PRIME MINISTER
WARNING THAT WE'RE BEING TREATED LIKE SIMPLETONS WITH OUTLANDISH CLAIMS OF DIRE OUTCOMES QUESTION THOUGH IS WHY THEY'RE DOING IT PERHAPS IT IS WORKING CLAIRE EMES IS FROM THE POLLSTERS HIPS OS MAURIE AND SHE JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW FROM GLASGOW MORNING TO YOU CLAIRE GOOD MORNING IS THERE A SIGN THAT MUCH AS WE MAY SAY THAT WE DON'T LIKE THESE MESSAGES MUCH AS WE MAY SAY OH FOR GOODNESS SAKE TREAT US LIKE ADULTS WE DO RESPOND
WELL YOU'RE RIGHT THAT BOTH SIDES ARE NO DOUBT USING THIS I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THERE'S ALMOST TWO CONVERSATIONS GOING ON AROUND THE TWO SORT OF WHAT SEEMS THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THEY WILL DECIDE TO VOTE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JANE SO AROUND THE ECONOMY SQUARE IF YOU IF YOU SUPPORT REMAINED THEN ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF REMAIN VOTERS ARE SAYING THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEREAS IT'S ONLY A QUARTER OF LIV WORRIES IMMIGRATION AND SOVEREIGNTY
HE'S SORT OF THE THING THAT THAT LIP THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN ARE REALLY PUSHING HOME AND IF YOU SUPPORT LEAVE THEN THAT'S ABOUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF VOTERS ARE SAYING THIS MATTERS TO THEM TOWING CREW TERMS IN AMERICA THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU HAVE TO GET THE SALIENT ISSUES THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS CRUDELY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND FEARS ABOUT THE ECONOMY IT'S GOOD FOR REMAIN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION IN FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRATION IT IS GOOD FOR LEAVE YOU COULD SAY THAT AND I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO
SO IF WE LOOK BACK AT OUR POLES AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING BRITAIN IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ASKED THE GENERAL PUBLIC BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ONLY AROUND FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE BRING UP EUROPE AND THE E.U. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT GENERALLY IS AFFECTING OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES HERE APPEAR AT THE EUROPEAN UNION ONLY ABOUT TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF US THINK THAT IT ACTUALLY AFFECTS US UNLIKE LOCAL COUNCILS IT'S MUCH MUCH HIGHER THE GOVERNMENT
I THINK PART OF WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET US TO ACTUALLY CARE SO THAT PERHAPS WE WILL TURN OUT FOR WHICHEVER SIDE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE SO PICK AN ISSUE THAT WE DO CARE ABOUT ON THE ONE HAND HOUSE PRICES ON THE OTHER HAND N.H.S. QUEUES AND SAY TO US YOU MAY NOT THINK THERE'S A LINK BUT THERE REALLY IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THIS THING YOU CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT AND THIS THING THAT UP TILL NOW AS LEFTY PRETTY BOUGHT
YES AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE SEEM TO BE MOVING THE ARGUMENTS ARE MOVING FROM THE MORE MACRO MACRO ECONOMIC ISSUES AND THE ECONOMY TO TO THINGS THAT ARE MORE PERSONAL SO WE ASKED PEOPLE WHETHER THEY THOUGHT IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT WOULD AFFECT YOUR OWN STANDARD OF LIVING
GENERALLY ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE SAID THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY'RE STARTING TO FOCUS ON THIS NOW AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE N.H.S. IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IT'S THE CLOSEST THING TO A RELIGION FOR MANY BRITISH PEOPLE CLAIRE THERE IS METHOD IN THEIR MADNESS FROM THE POSTERS IT'S US MARIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS JUST COMING UP TO THREE MINUTES TO NINE NOW WE HAVE TO QUITE A FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF YESTERDAY'S PROGRAMME

THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE LEFT WITH IS DID THIS START WITH AN ORDINARY ELECTRICAL FAULT TO SHORT CIRCUIT WHICH STARTED A FIRE OR WAS THE FIRE STARTED DELIBERATELY WITH A SMALL EXPLOSION OR AN INCENDIARY DEVICE SO IT COULD STILL BE TERRORISM BUT IT LOOKS AS IF THE AIRCRAFT WENT OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE THE CONTROLS WERE LITERALLY BURNING UP
