I KNEW THEY WOULD NEVER GET TO TOUGH UP THERE AND
WHAT LIPSTICK CAN TEACH US ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION ALSO WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THE ARCHERS LAST NIGHT
YOU SEE THIS NICE TAKE IT COME ON PUT IT IN YOUR HAND
HOW COULD YOU THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHARLES CARROLL ELEVEN MILLION CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS LEAKED FROM A PANAMANIAN LAW FIRM HAVE EXPOSED MONEY LAUNDERING TAX EVASION AND THE DODGING OF INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE GLOBAL ELITE WAS SACKED FROM SEKOA HAS INSISTED THE OFFSHORE COMPANIES IT CREATES FOR ITS CLIENTS ARE LEGITIMATE RICHARD BILTON REPORTS
THERE ARE LINKS TO SEVENTY TWO CURRENT OR FORMER HEADS OF STATE INCLUDING THE ICELANDIC PRIME MINISTER SIGMUND ARE GOOD AND LARKS AND WHO HAD AN UNDECLARED INTEREST LINKED TO HIS WIFE'S WEALTH AND IS NOW FACING CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION THE FILES REVEAL A SUSPECTED BILLION DOLLAR MONEY LAUNDERING RING INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF PRESIDENT PUTIN
MOST SACK FONSECA SAY THE ALLEGATIONS ARE UNSUPPORTED AND FALSE THEY HAVE ALWAYS COMPLIED WITH INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE COMPANIES ARE NOT USE FOR ILLICIT PURPOSES
THE AUSTRALIAN TAX OFFICE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT ITS INVESTIGATING EIGHT HUNDRED CLIENTS OF MY SEX AND SECKER FOR POSSIBLE TAX EVASION IT SAYS THAT SOME CASES MAY BE REFERRED TO THE COUNTRY'S SERIOUS FINANCIAL CRIME TASK FORCE HE HEARD THE H.M.R.C. HAS ASKED TO SEE ANY RELEVANT FILES THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED TO VIGOROUSLY CO OPERATE WITH ANY LEGAL ACTION THERE MAYBE LAUNCHED AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THIS STORY ON PANORAMA ON B.B.C. ONE AT SEVEN THIRTY TONIGHT
TWO BOATS HAVE SET SAIL FROM THE GREEK ISLAND OF LESBOS AS A CONTROVERSIAL OPERATION TO RETURN HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TO TURKEY GETS UNDER WAY THOSE WHO HAVEN'T APPLIED FOR ASYLUM OR HAVE HAD THEIR CLAIMS REJECTED HER BEING FERRIED BACK TO THE TURKISH MAINLAND THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS AGREED TO RESETTLE SYRIANS FROM CAMPS WITHIN TURKEY IN RETURN MARK LOWE AND REPORTS FROM DICKIE LEE IN TURKEY
BOTH TURKEY AND GREECE HAVE MADE A PANICKED RUSHED TO MEET THIS DEADLINE AND NEITHER COUNTRY IS REALLY READY ONLY A FRACTION OF THE NECESSARY STAFF HAVE ARRIVED ON THE GREEK ISLANDS TO ACCOMPANY THE PROCESS AND IN TURKEY THE PREPARATION IS STILL SKETCHY
TWO TENTS HAVE BEEN ERECTED IN PARTICULARLY TO REGISTER THEIR FIRST GROUP FROM LES BOSS WITH SIMILAR FACILITIES FURTHER SOUTH TO RECEIVE MIGRANTS SENT FROM HERE COS THE TURKISH INTERIOR MINISTER SAYS NON SYRIANS WILL BE DEPORTED WHILE SYRIANS WILL BE SENT TO REFUGEE CAMPS WHERE THEY WILL REPLACE THOSE WHO'LL BE DIRECTLY RESETTLED IN EUROPE AS PART OF THAT ONE FOR ONE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL PUBLISH NEW FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF EUROPEAN UNION MIGRANTS WERE WORKING IN THE U.K. THE STATISTICS WILL BE RELEASED IN MAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND NUMBER OF M.P.S HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL FIGURES FOR MIGRANTS ENTERING THE COUNTRY AND THE NUMBER OF NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS BEING ISSUED
CHILDREN IN ENGLAND SCHOOLS HA PERFORMING LESS WELL THAN THEIR INTERNATIONAL PEERS IN COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA AND FINLAND ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM AN EDUCATION THINK TANK RESPONDING TO THE RESEARCH BY CENTRE FORUM THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT WAS CONFIDENT THAT SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WOULD RISE TO THE CHALLENGE ALLOWING MORE PUPILS TO COMPETE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD THAT EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT BRYONY MACKENZIE REPORTS
THIS NEW ANALYSIS SHOWED OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF SECONDARY AND FORTY PERCENT OF PRIMARY PUPILS A FAILING TO REACH WORLD CLASS STANDARDS ON WRITING LITERACY MATHS AND SCIENCE IT ALSO SHOWS REGIONAL DIVISION WITH SECONDARY PUPILS IN LONDON OUTPERFORMING THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
HOWEVER DATA FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN SHOWS THEY ARE ACHIEVING A GOOD LEVEL DEVELOPMENT IN LINE WITH THE TOP PERFORMING COUNTRIES HOUSEHOLDERS IN AREAS AFFECTED BY FLOODING WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A NEW INSURANCE SCHEME FROM THIS MORNING THE FLOOD RE INITIATIVE IS BEING FUNDED BY EXISTING INSURANCE COMPANIES AND IS DESIGNED TO KEEP PREMIUMS DOWN JULIET WILLIAMSES FROM CIRCLE INSURANCE
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS GONNA BE HUGE I MEAN THE PREMIUM RATE SURGED
IN THE END FOR THE FLOOD PART THE REST AND IT'S RAKED ON YOUR COUNTER
IN A LOWER COUNCIL TAX BAND BUT IT'LL BE CHEAPER FOR THEM TO ENSURE THAT RISK AND
I HACKED AND THERE'LL BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT MEANS THAT YOU ONLY HAVE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS
THE B.B.C. HAS UNEARTHED A PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN VIDEO OF THE FORMER M.I.SIX OFFICER KIM PHILBY IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES HIS CAREER AS A SOVIET SPY THE TAPE WHICH WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE MADE PUBLIC SHOWS PHILBY GIVING A LECTURE TO THE EAST GERMAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IT WAS UNCOVERED BY OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT GORDON CABRERA

HIS MOTIVATIONAL TALK FOR THE ASSEMBLED SPIES ENDS WITH A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AND ONE FINAL PIECE OF ADVICE IF CONFRONTED DENY EVERYTHING AND NEVER CONFESS
AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE IN THE PHILBY TAPE ON RADIO FOUR THIS EVENING AT EIGHT P.M. IT'S NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST AND CHRIS FAWKES IS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING CHRIS GOOD MORNING SARAH WE'RE LOOKING AT AN UNSETTLED DAY TODAY FOR MOST AREAS WE START THE DAY CLOUDY AND THERE WILL BE SOME RAIN OR SHOWERS AROUND THROUGH THE DAY TODAY SO IT'S A DAY FOR TAKING THE UMBRELLA IF YOU'RE HEADING OUT TO WORK SHORTLY
I'LL START OFF WITH THE FORECAST ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES WERE AS HAVE MENTIONED IT IS A CLOUDY START FOR MOST WE'VE GOT SOME THICK CLOUD WORKING ACROSS WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EAST ANGLIA TO JUST A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN HERE ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN ACROSS THE FAR NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND WITH SHOWERS ALREADY BREAKING OUT ACROSS WALES AND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS WILL TURN QUITE HEAVY THROUGH THE MORNING BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE AFTERNOON SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO BREAK OUT FAIRLY WIDELY THERE'LL BE HEAVY WITH SOME THUNDER MIXED IN
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE PARTICULARLY SLOW MOVING THERE WILL BE SOME AREAS THAT GET SOME HEAVY DOWNPOURS COULD LEAD TO SOME LOCALISED SURFACE WATER FLOODING WORRIES OF PLACES MISSING THE SHOWERS THE SKIES BRIGHTENING UP AND THERE'LL BE SOME BRIGHT OR SUNNY SPELLS COMING THROUGH THE CLOUD AND UNSETTLED KIND OF AFTERNOON SOMEWHERE IS GETTING SOME HEFTY DOWNPOURS OTHERWISE SOMEWHERE IS GETTING AWAY WITH DRIER WEATHER BUT TEMPERATURE WISE WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGHS OF AROUND THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS GENERALLY IS A COUPLE OF DEGREES COLDER THAN IT WAS ON SUNDAY BUT STILL FEELING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE AND LIGHT WINDS
IN NORTHERN IRELAND NOW CLOUD WILL CONTINUE TO THICKEN UP AND WILL SEE OUTBREAKS OF RAIN PARTICULARLY AFFECTING ANTRIM AND DOWN BUT THAT RAIN WILL TRY TO PUSH FURTHER WESTWARDS AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TODAY MAY WELL NOT QUITE REACHED THE FAR WEST BUT WE HAVE TO SEE THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE WESTERN POSITION OF THAT RAIN TEMPERATURE WISE LOOKING AT HIGHS OF ELEVEN DEGREES I FOUND IT FOR SCOTLAND OUTBREAKS OF RAIN WILL BECOME FAIRLY WIDESPREAD AND SLOW MOVING THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON SO MANY AREAS WILL TURN WET THROUGH THE DAY TEMPERATURES AROUND NINE DEGREES CELSIUS THAT'S LATEST WEATHER
THANKS VERY MUCH CHRIS IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX A HUGE LEAK OF CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS HAS REVEALED HOW RICH AND POWERFUL PEOPLE USE TAX HAVENS TO HIDE THEIR WEALTH THE ELEVEN MILLION DOCUMENTS WERE LEAKED FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SECRETIVE COMPANIES A PANAMANIAN LAW FIRM CALLED MON SAC VON SECKER THEY SHOW HOW THE COMPANY'S HELP CLIENTS LAUNDER MONEY DODGE SANCTIONS AND AVOID AND EVADE TAX
MUST LIKE VON SECKER SAY THEY'VE OPERATED BEYOND REPROACH FOR FORTY YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OR CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL WRONGDOING WHILE JONTY BLOOMERS A CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE PAPERS ARE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PAPERS JONTY ON AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY GIVE US A BIT OF THE BACKGROUND THE SCALE OF THIS LEAK JUST PROVIDES US WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED GLIMPSE INTO THE SECRET WORLD OF OFFSHORE FINANCE MORE SUCKED FRONT SECKER OFFERS FINANCIAL SERVICES LIKE FOUNDATIONS TRUSTS NOMINEE DIRECTORS THEY'RE ALL DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE HIDE THEIR WEALTH
AND THE DOCUMENTS WERE LINKED TO THE GERMAN NEWSPAPER SIR GEORGE'S I TONGUE AND SHARED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS PANORAMA FOR THE B. B. C. AND THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER IN THE U.K. ARE AMONG ONE HUNDRED SEVEN MEDIA ORGANISATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE BEEN ANALYSING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE RANGE OF CLIENTS THAT THIS COMPANY HAVE IS EXTRAORDINARY THERE ARE LINKS TO SEVENTY TWO CURRENT OR FORMER HEADS OF STATE INCLUDING DICTATORS LIKE PRESIDENT THE BARRACK FOR MY PRESENT BARRACK OF EGYPT AND PRESIDENT GADAFFI LIBYA
OH KAY SEDUM GIVE US SOME SENSE I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO PLOUGH THROUGH THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL BUT WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT TAX HAVENS WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING TO HIDE THEIR WEALTH AT SOME SOMETIMES FOR LEGITIMATE REASONS WATER THAT WHAT IS IN THESE PAPERS WILL DO THERE'S JUST THE EXTRAORDINARY DEALS IN THE DETAILS WITHIN THE FILES BEAR IN MIND THIS COMPANY MUST LIKE VON SECKER PROMISED ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY
SO THESE ARE THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER BE VIEWED BY US BY THE AUTHORITIES IN FACT BY ANYBODY ELSE NOW THE VERY DETAILED TO GIVE YOU FLAVOUR THE FILE REVEALS A SUSPECTED BILLION DOLLAR MONEY LAUNDERING RING INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA
AND THE DATA SHOWS HANDY AS LONG AS LENT IT PRIME MINISTER SIGMUND OR GOOD LUGS AND HAD AN UNDECLARED INTEREST IN HIS COUNTRY'S BAILED OUT BANKS I DO HE SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG
THERE ARE ALSO MANY MORE BASIC CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALS IN THE U.K. HAVE USED PANAMANIAN TRUSTS AND FOUNDATIONS TO DODGE TAX ON FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTY DEALS HERE IN LONDON AND THAT'S WHY IT MATTERS WELL YES BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE FILES SHOW THAT THIS COMPANY WAS UNDERMINING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION TO DESIGNED TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING FOR INSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS CREATING A REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST THAT'S BASICALLY A PUBLIC LIST OF WHO OWNS EVERY U.K. COMPANY
AND THAT STANDARD PRACTICE IN INTERNATIONAL FINANCE BANK'S LAWYERS ACCOUNTANTS NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES UNWITTINGLY BEING HELPED HELPING MONEY LAUNDERERS OR FRAUDSTERS OR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING OTHER CRIMES BUT ONE FILE SHOWS THAT THIS COMPANY WAS SELLING FAKE OWNERSHIP RECORDS TO HAIDA WAS THE CLIENT'S MONEY FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND THEY DID IT FOR A BIG THICK WHAT'S THE COMPANY SAYING ABOUT THIS ONE WAS LIKE FONSECA SAYS OFFSHORE COMPANIES ARE AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE THEY USE FOR A VARIETY OF LEGITIMATE PURPOSES
THEY SAY FOR FORTY YEARS THEY'VE OPERATED BEYOND REPROACH AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OF CHARGING CONNECTION CRIMINAL WRONGDOING AND ALLEGATIONS IT SOLD FAKE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP DETAILS ARE UNSUPPORTED AND FALSE JONTY BLOOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEMON LOOK AT THE OTHER PAPERS THAT OF COURSE THAT HAD LANDED
FRONT PAGE LOTS OF OTHER PAGES IN THE GUARDIAN AND OTHER PAID OTHER PAPERS HAVE PLENTY ELSE IN THEM AND PARTICULARLY ON THE SUBJECT OF STEEL BRITISH STEEL TO RISE FROM THE ASHES THE TELEGRAPH SAYS ON ITS FRONT PAGE WRITTEN STEEL INDUSTRY COULD BE SAVED FROM COLLAPSE BY TWO LITTLE KNOWN FINANCES WHO HOPE TO REVIVE THE BRITISH STILL NAME IT CAN BE DISCLOSED TODAY THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MARK AND NATHANIEL MAYER
WHO ARE BROTHERS THE BROTHERS BEHIND GREY BALL THAT INVESTMENT FIRM THAT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT TO POUR MONEY INTO SCUNTHORPE WELL THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE DEAL TO SAY THE PATEL
PLANT IN SOUTH WALES THE TIMES THOSE SUGGEST THAT THEY COULD BE REAL DIFFICULTIES DOING THAT BECAUSE THE PLAN TO RESCUE BRITISH STEEL PLANTS BY NATIONALISING THEIR PENSION POT THAT OF COURSE A VERY CRUCIAL PART OF ANY DEAL WOULD BE BLOCKED BY E.U. RULES MINISTERS HAVE BEEN WALK
THE DAILY MAIL'S LEAD IS THE STORY THAT'S COME OUT FROM AN EDUCATION THINK TANK CENTRE FORUM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO WHITE BRITISH SCHOOLS AS THEY PREPARE PUPILS AS THEY PROGRESSED THROUGH SCHOOLS THE HEADLINE IS BETRAYAL OF WHITE PEOPLE'S BECAUSE THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT AT THE AGE OF FIVE WHITE BRITISH STUDENTS ARE AMONG THE TOP THREE HIGHEST ACHIEVERS BUT AS THEY GET GO THROUGH SCHOOL AND BY THE TIME THEY REACH SIXTEEN THEY'VE SLIPPED
THEY ARE SLIM THERE ARE TEN OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS ABOVE THEM BY THE TIME THEY SIT THEIR G. C. G. C. S. IT EASE THE COMPARISON IS MADE BY THOSE WHO BASICALLY HAVE ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE AND THOSE WHO HAVE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE YOU SEEM TO DO VERY WELL
AND ACCORDING TO THE THINK TANK IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE LET DOWN BY SCHOOLS AND BY PARENTS WHO DON'T FULLY SUPPORT THEIR EDGE IT THEIR EDUCATION IT'S IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WHO ACCORDING TO THE
HE'S BY THE REPORT WHO ARE KEEN TO MAKE USE OF THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ON OFFER THE TELEGRAPH ON ITS FRONT PAGE SAYS THE TRUE SCALE OF IMMIGRATION IS GOING TO BE REVEALED JUST WEEKS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM ON THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP AFTER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AGREED TO PUBLISH WITH HELD STATISTICS AFTER PRESSURE FROM EUROSCEPTICS NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT EDITOR CAN THROW MORE LIGHT ON THIS AND WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING NORMAN
WHILE H.M.R.C. HAVE WRITTEN TO THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEE CONFIRMING THEY WILL PUBLISH AT THE END OF MAY DETAILS OF THE NUMBER OF EASE YOU MIGRANTS SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS WHY THESE FIGURES ARE SO SENSITIVE IS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIDELY HELD SUSPICION AT WESTMINSTER THAT THEY WILL SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS COMING INTO BRITAIN POTENTIALLY HAS BEEN MASSIVELY MASSIVELY UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF A HUGE DISCREPANCY IT SEEMS
BETWEEN THE NUMBER COMING IN ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL OH N.S. FIGURES AND THEIR NUMBERS SEEKING TO WORK ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES OF THOSE SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER SO WE KNOW SINCE TWENTY TEN THEY HAVE ROUGHLY ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S BEEN ONE MILLION E.U. MIGRANTS COMING IN TO THE U.K.
THE ESTIMATES FOR THOSE SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS IS TWO MILLION IN OTHER WORDS ARE RUNNING AT TWICE THE RATE OF THE OFFICIAL FIGURES SO THOSE FIGURES ARE GOING TO BE PUBLISHED HUGELY HUGELY SENSITIVE POTENTIALLY HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY INCENDIARY EFFECT ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUBLISHED JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE REFERENDUM ITSELF
COMPLEX THOUGH BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT BE HERE AND APPLY FOR THE NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER AFTER QUITE A WHILE OF BEING HAVE A DUCK DOESN'T NECESSARILY SHOW DOES IT THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY COME IN AND APPLIED FOR THE NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBER AND THEREFORE THAT THE THE BALD FIGURES ABOUT IMMIGRATION OR WRONG MARIE I MEAN IT IS STATISTICAL QUAGMIRE THE ARGUMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN THE DISCREPANCY IS BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS COME FOR SHORT TERM WORK THEY COME TO WORK IN THE FOOD PRESSING PROCESSING INDUSTRY THEY COME TO WORK ON FARMS AND THEN RETURN HOME AFTER A SEASON'S WORKING HERE OR ANOTHER ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE FRAUD IN NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS BUT
IF THE DISCREPANCY IS AS LARGE AS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS TO ME IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN BY JUST THAT ADDED TO WHICH IS LONG BEEN A GRIPE AMONGST EURO SCEPTICS AT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DELIBERATELY SOUGHT TO WITHHOLD THIS INFORMATION SAYING IT'S TOO COSTLY IT'S TOO COMPLEX NOW WE DO GET THESE FIGURES MORE THAN THAT
LYNN HOMER SAYS THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO PUBLISH THE FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF E.U. MIGRANTS CLAIMING TAX CREDITS CLAIMING CHILD BENEFIT ALL OF WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE IS GOING TO BE AMMUNITION FOR THOSE SEEKING TO LEAVE THE E.U. NON SIR THANKS
IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX CENTRE THERE HAVE BEEN MORE EFFORTS TO TAKE THE HEAT OUT OF THE U.K. STILL CRISIS JOE LINE AND IS HERE WITH THAT AND THE REST OF BUSINESS GOOD MORNING TO YOU TATA STEEL IN PARTICULAR AND MASS PRODUCED STEEL IN GENERAL STANDS AT A CROSSROADS THIS WEEK I'M GOING TO SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME DISCUSSING IT WITH HER FROM ANOTHER NUMBER OF ANGLES IN A MOMENT WE'LL LOOK AT THE PENSIONS ISSUE WITH JOHN RALPH WHY MANUFACTURING JOBS SEEM TO GET A LOT MORE ATTENTION THAN OTHER TYPES OF JOBS
BUT FIRST LET'S DISCUSS THE OPTIONS FACING TATA STEEL WHICH IS UP FOR SALE BUT COULD GET UPPED IT COULD GET A LOT MORE TROUBLE EXCUSE ME IT'S LOSING ONE MILLION POUNDS A DAY IF IT'S THE SITUATION IS NOT SOLVE ALESSANDRO A BATTY IS THE STEEL INDUSTRY ANALYST A BEAR IN BURBANK GOOD MORNING TO ALICE ANDREW MORNING CAN WE START WITH WHO MIGHT BUY A TARTAR STEERS OPERATION WE UNDERSTAND THAT LIBERTY HOUSE OWNER A YOU'VE GOT IS ON HIS WAY BACK FROM DUBAI
TO TALK TO TALK TURKEY YES SURE I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE STORY SHORT BOUGHT A BOARD NEEDS TO BE SPLIT INTO PARTS THE ONE THE FIRST ONE IS THE ONE THE MANUFACTURERS STEAL THE SECOND ONE IS THAT THE WONDER FINISHERS AND SUPPLY THE MATERIAL WILL BE END CUSTOMER SITE AT THE MOMENT THE PROBLEM OR POOR TARBERT DISCREETLY RELATED TO THE CRECHE COURSE OR PRODUCING OR MAKING STEEL NOT THE ONE THAT IS RELATED TO THE FINAL INDUCED CUSTOMERS
AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE ONLY TWO OPTIONS ON THE STEALING MAKE INSIDE THAT I THINK BIBLE THE FIRST ONE IS RUSSIA BECAUSE THE PRODUCER THE SEMI FINISHED THING WHICH IS SLABS VERY BEDDED CASH BOSSED THE SECOND ONE IS RELATED TO BUT BECAUSE VERY EYES AS WELL AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE SELF SUFFICIENCY RAW MATERIAL THE THIRD OPTION SLIGHTLY BUT THE HOUSE IS IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE LIBERTY HOUSES ARE FINALLY LUMPED ON SIR TRAILING US WITH SOME U.K. FOR THE FINISHING OR STEEL
BUT THE PROBLEM RELATED PUT UP AS THESE TWO BULLY BIRTHDAY ALCE WAS THE ONE TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT IS STRUCTURALLY VIABLE IN NOT ONLY SCREW C. WOULD BE RELATED TO THE SICKLY CARRIED TO THE BUSINESS IN VERY SIMPLE WORDS HE MEANS IF THE CURRENCY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE U.K. IS THERE FROM ADVANTAGE FOR THIS
SECRETLY IS A GOOD FACTOR BUT IT'S THE ONE JUST TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE THE CURRENCY CHANGES THE STEAM INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. BECOMES IMMEDIATELY UNCOMPETITIVE AS IF STARTED GET STRONGER THE IT SHOULD BECOME EXACTLY BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S GETTING WEAKER IN THE RUN UP TO THE ABBOT AGES RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT IS ABSOLUTE TECHNICALLY VIABLE IF THAT IS SIR BAFTA WHICH IS INTERESTED ILLEGALLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE DOWNSTREAM OPERATION
THEY CAN GUARANTEE AN ACCESS TO THE MOST PROFITABLE MARKET BECAUSE SPORTS INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. AND THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST COMPELLING INDUCER SEGMENT FOR ANYBODY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE INTERESTED VERY BRIEFLY THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMIES AND TROUBLE ITSELF SO MAYBE WE WE MIGHT WANT TO RULE OUT THE BRAZILIA INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY MAY WANT TO TAKE THOSE JOBS OUT OF THE U.K. AND BRING THEM BACK TO EXACTLY THE MOMENT I BASICALLY MADE THE NAME OF THE BRAZILIANS BECAUSE THE BRAZILIANS HAVE THEIR MOMENT TO SPORTING QUITE A LOT TO EUROPE BECAUSE OF THEIR CURRENCY
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THE PRESIDENT ECONOMIES AND THE SESSION AT THE MOMENT SO I CAN NOW REALLY A CESS THE PRIORITY FOR THIS WHAT A TOOL I LOOK AT THE RESOURCES MORE TO FIX THE DOMESTIC PROBLEM RATHER THAN ACTUALLY FIX THE EXTRA PROBLEMS
THE RUSSIANS I THINK AT THE MOMENT IS A VIABLE OPTION B. COOLS HISTORICALLY THE PRODUCE THAT SLABS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY BUILD AGUS CROSSING EUROPE OH KAY WILL COME BACK TO AT SOME STAGE ALESSANDRO AND IF THERE IS TO BE A BUYER FOR THE U.K. OPERATIONS OF TARTARE THE NEW OWNER WILL ALSO HAVE TO TAKE ON IT'S RATHER GENEROUS PENSION SCHEME WHICH DATES BACK TO THE FORMER NATIONALISED BRITISH STEEL IS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAID YOU'D JAB IT SPEAKING ON THE ANDREW MARR SHOW YESTERDAY
NO ONE'S TO NATIONALISATION OF PENSION SCHEMES BUT IT IS SOMETHING I ABSOLUTELY RECOGNISE IS A CHALLENGE THIS IS A LONG RUNNING PENSION SCHEME IT GOES BACK TO THE BRITISH STEEL DAYS IT'S AN EXPENSIVE SCHEME THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY SET UP AND IT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT TO YOU RETIRED WORKERS TO CURRENT WORKERS AND WE RECOGNISE THAT SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD JEOPARDISE THEM AND WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM IT BUT IT IS AN ISSUE AND AGAIN WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT
AND THAT SUCH A JAB IT LET'S BRING IN JOHN RALPH HE'S MY PEN OR PENSIONS CONSULTANT GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOHN GOOD MORNING JO TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS A PENSION SCHEME AND HOW THEY CAN GET OVER THE HUMP HERE BECAUSE IT WOULD POTENTIALLY HALF A BILLION POUNDS ON ACCOUNTED FOR PENSION HALL THAT SOME POTENTIAL BUYER MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU WERE RIGHT THERE JERRY IN TERMS OF WHETHER A POTENTIAL BUYER WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER IT AS WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER A FLIPPITY HOUSE OR THE RUSSIANS OR GRRR ABLE CAPITAL OR ANYBODY ELSE WERE TO BUY ONE OF THE TWELVE PLANTS THEY WOULD BE BUYING PHYSICAL ASSETS THAT PRODUCE THE STEEL AND ALL THEY'D BE BUYING THEIR SUBSIDIARIES
AT THE DOME GOES STILL PRODUCING ASSETS THE PENSION SCHEME WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION POUNDS WOULD REMAIN WITH STAFF WITH TATA STEEL U.K. LIMITED THERE WAS THE U.K. HOLDING COMPANY SO YOU'LL BE SELLING ASSET
IF YOU'RE BUYING ASSETS COMES WE'LL BE BUYING ASSETS THEY WOULDN'T BE BUYING THEIR PENSION PENSION LIABILITIES AND WHAT YOU WOULD THEN END UP WITH IS EFFECTIVELY A SHELL COMPANY WITH NO ASSETS OR CASH FLOW ALL THE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED WHICH RACE IS THE ISSUE THAT THIS PRETENSION THIS POTENTIAL PENSION LIABILITY WOULD THEN GO INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND I THINK IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY INEVITABLE
THAT THE FIFTEEN BILLION POUND PENSION SCHEME WITH A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PENSION SCHEME MEMBERS WILL GO INTO THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND AND WILL THAT AFFECT THE REST OF US I HAVE SUCH A HUGE SCHEME THAT WE HAVE TO SET THAT'S NINETY SEVEN PERCENT COVERED I.E. MONEY HAS BEEN SET ASIDE SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY FIFTEEN BILLION IN THE IN THE GROW SENSE BUT WILL THAT BE IT WILL THAT AFFECT THE REST OF US IF THAT KIND OF SIZE A PENSION SCHEME GETS INTO THE PEOPLE
THE PENSION SCHEME IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW CREDIT TO IT IS ONE OF THE BEST FUNDED SCHEMES IN THE COUNTRY ON AVERAGE SCHEMES FOR ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT UNDERFUNDED AGAINST THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND MEASURE WE'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE
WHERE BRITISH STILL PENSION SCHEME IS TODAY I CAN'T SEE IT BEING ANY MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT AND IT COULD BE THEY SAY IT'S NINETY SEVEN PERCENT UPFRONT AS WELL THE COMPANY SAYS BASED YEAH I'M NOT SURE WELL YES THAT MAY BE RIGHT OR IT MAY NOT BE RIGHT IT MIGHT BE THREE PER CENT UNDERFUNDED IT MIGHT BE FIVE PER CENT UNDERFUNDED BUT THAT SORT OF ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IS LET'S SAY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS LET'S SAY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND IS SET UP TO TAKE ON
ANY NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALL SCHEMES THIS WOULD BE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF NUMBERS THIS WOULD BE THE LARGEST SCHEMES YOU'RE TAKEN ON BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE PROBABLY TWICE THE THAT THE PREVIOUS LARGEST SCHEME IT DOESN'T KILL THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND BY ANY MEANS BUT IT'S CLEARLY NOT GOOD NEWS OH KAY CHANCE STAY WITH US FOR NOW THE REASON WHY COURTESY OF HAS BEEN IN OUR HEADLINES ARE FOR THE PAST WEEK IS BECAUSE FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR SO WELL PAID BY THE FACTORY JOBS ARE ON THE LINE
BUT IF THEY WERE RETAIL OR BANKING OR CALL CENTRE JOBS WITH THE BEE AS MANY HEADLINES OR WOULD THERE BE A TASK FORCE SET UP A WHAT A PRIME MINISTER CUT SHORT HIS HOLIDAY OR A TRIP OVERSEAS TO COME HOME AND DEAL WITH IT WHY DO WE APPEAR TO VALUE MANUFACTURING JOBS MORE THAN SERVICE JOBS TREVOR DATSUN IT USED TO BE A VERY SENIOR EXECUTIVES FOR SAINSBURY'S AND BEFORE THAT TESCO WITH THE CONSULTANTS ARE TWELVE GOOD MORNING TO YOU TREVOR YOU MONEY WHY DO WE CARE MORE SUPPOSEDLY ABOUT MANUFACTURING JOBS
IT'S FASCINATING ISN'T IT I MEAN THE RETAIL ECONOMY CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION POUNDS TO THE U.K. ECONOMY IN TERMS OF GROSS VALUE AT HALF A MILLION BUSINESSES IN THERE WE EMPLOY THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE SECTOR OR FOUR AND A HALF MILLION IF YOU INCLUDE WHOLESALERS I WOULDN'T FOR SECONDS SAY THAT RETAIL JOBS ARE WORTH MORE THAN MANUFACTURING JOBS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT COMPARISON A LOT IN HEADLINES TERMS THEY ARE
SORRY BETTER FACTORY JOBS ARE WORTH MORE YES I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT RETAILERS ARE SORT OF PART OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES WE ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH THE BRANDS WE WALK IN AND OUT OF THEM OR NOT AND ALSO THE INDUSTRY HAS PROVEN VERY ADEPT AT ADAPTING TO CHANGE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF NEW PRESSURES ON THE INDUSTRY NEW ENTRANCE COMING IN WE'VE GOT THE INTERNET PLAYERS TAKING AN INCREASING SHARE OF THE MARKET
AND MORE RECENTLY WE'VE GOT THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WE'VE GOT BUSINESS RATES ARE SORT OF SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL SO THE INDUSTRY HAS PROVEN EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE DO YOU FIND A FRUSTRATING WHEN IF YOU LOU SEVEN THOUSAND JOBS ONE COMET SHUT DOWN AT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO THAT THERE WAS NOT MUCH SAID ABOUT IT
IT IS A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING YOU KNOW RETAIL OFFERS AMAZING DIVERSITY IN THE TOUCH HER CAREER IT CAN OFFER YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHOSE DAUGHTER IS SHOOTING UP THROUGH THE RANKS OF WAITROSE AND WILL DOUBTLESS DO VERY WELL IN THE STORE MANAGER IN A BIG STORE CAN SORT OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PROBLEM EQUALLY YOU KNOW THE BULK OF THE JOBS ARE JOBS WHICH PEOPLE TAKE COS OF THEIR FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OF THEIR PROXIMITY
THEY ARE AND RETAIL IS WE ARE A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS RETAIL SHOPPERS AND SHOPPERS WE LOVE IT AND WE'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AS WELL TRAVELLED AT IN THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NICK HUNGERFORD IS A FROM NUTMEG INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IS A MARKETING EXPERTS WANT TO GOOD MORNING TO YOU NICK COMPLETE A HANDBRAKE TURN TALK ABOUT HEDGE FUNDS IT'S I SUPPOSE IT'S RELATED TO RETAIL THEY GOT THEIR FINGERS BURNT IN A BET THAT MORRISONS SUPERMARKET WOULD FALL IN VALUE
YES GOOD MORNING THIS IS QUITE AN ASTONISHING STORY RELATES VERY CLOSELY TO WHAT TREVOR WAS SAYING ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY OF RETAIL MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO ADAPT TO THE NEW WORLD THAT THEY ARE IN MORRISONS HAD AN ACTIVIST HEDGE FUND ON ITS CASE THEY SHORTED THE SHARES OF MORRISON'S WHICH MEANS THEY WERE BETTING THAT THE PRICE WOULD GO DOWN
BUT IN FACT MORRISON'S PULLED OUT SOME EXCELLENT CHRISTMAS RESULTS AND THEY'VE SURPRISED US WITH THEIR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGY SO MOST NOTABLY THEY SIGNED A DEAL WITH AMAZON TO BECOME THE DELIVERY MECHANISM FOR AMAZON'S PANTRY SERVICE SO THE SHARES IF I GUESS YOU'VE GONE VERY WELL THIRTY PER CENT UP SINCE NOVEMBER SO THIS THIS HEDGE FUNDERS
RUN AWAY WITH ITS TAIL BETWEEN ITS LEGS AND LOST ITS SHIRT A BIT ONTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS AT THE BANKS AREN'T BIDDING ENOUGH FOR U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THIS ONE IS QUITE SIMPLE THE BIDDING FOR U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS HAS BECOME LESS PROFITABLE AND MORE RISKY
SO AS A CONSEQUENCE LESS BANKS WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH IT AND THAT'S ALL REALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'RE NOW UNBELIEVABLY LOW INTEREST RATES IF YOU LOOK BACK HISTORICALLY WERE IN A IN A VERY PARTICULAR SITUATION AS AS TO WHY THAT IS WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT INTEREST RATES WILL RISE
MEANS LESS CHANCE TO MAKE MONEY FOR THESE BANKS AND SO THEY WERE RETREATING FROM ALL INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES AND THEY MAY BE THEY MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR BIDS FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS IF THEY WANT TO STAY IN THE CLUB THE EXCLUSIVE CLUB OF BANKS THAT CAN BID FOR GOVERNMENT GUILT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO THAT SO WHAT AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO SAY THE DEBT MANAGEMENT OFFICE GOING TO SAY IS INSTEAD OF SETTING A PRICE FOR TWO PER CENT PLEASE CAN YOU ALL SET A PRICE FOR FIVE PER CENT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT ENOUGH COVER IF WE DO WANT TO SELL SOME MORE DEBT
OH KAY NIKOLA FOR THERE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF A NUTMEG INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT THANKS TO JOHN RALPH THINKS TREVOR DEATHS AND TO ALESSANDRO FOR JOINING US ALL THIS MORNING THINK YOU JUST TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND ROB IS HERE WITH THE SPORT LE ROB YEAH HE'S JUST IN THERE HAS THAT EVER I WANT TO BE IN A CRICKET FINAL LIKE THIS STOKES IS ON HIS WAY AGAIN VIRTUALLY ALL THE FUEL WAS INSIDE THE CIRCLE MISTAKES DOES IN BOWLS TO BROTHER EXIT FOR SIX

RICHARD CONWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME AT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S BEEN REPORTED IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO THAT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY OR SO MIGRANTS MAINLY FROM PAKISTAN AND BANGLADESH ARE ON THEIR WAY BACK TO TURKEY FROM GREECE THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE BORDER AGENCY FRONT TEX SPOKESMAN SAYING THE PROCEDURE SO FAR HAD BEEN CALM EVERYTHING WAS ORDERLY LET'S TALK TO SARAH RAINFORD A CORRESPONDENT ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN HAPPENING
WE SAW THE FIRST OF THOSE FERRERS THE FIRST TWO OF THOSE FURS IS HEADING ACROSS THE AEGEAN HERE FROM THERE TO THE TURKISH MAINLAND IN FACT THEY'RE NOW GETTING CLOSE TO THE TURKISH SURE THEY HEADED OFF FAR EARLIER THAN WE EXPECTED WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT THEM AT TEN O'CLOCK IN FACT IT WAS MORE LIKE SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THEY SET SAIL BUT AS YOU SAY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX PEOPLE ON BOARD WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF LES PLUS HERE HAS TOLD US
MOST OF THEM WERE FROM PAKISTAN AND CERTAINLY WE HAD HEARD FROM GREEK OFFICIALS BEFORE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE DEPORTED IN THIS FIRST BATCH IF YOU LIKE ARE PEOPLE WHO HADN'T APPLIED FOR ASYLUM HERE SO WE WERE EXPECTING THEM TO BE THOSE REFERRED TO AS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS RATHER THAN PERHAPS THE SYRIANS THE IRAQIS AND THOSE FLEEING OBVIOUS CONFLICT ZONES WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM
BUT THESE PEOPLE WE UNDERSTAND AGREEMENTS ARE PLACED BETWEEN THE COUNTRY THEY COME FROM AND TURKEY WE EXPECT THEM TO BE DEPORTED BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN BUT THAT I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE SYRIANS START TO BE RETURNED IF THEIR ASYLUM APPLICATIONS HERE
UNLESS THE REJECT THERE IS THIS SCHEME THAT THE E.U. HAS PUT IN PLACE NOW WHICH MEANS THAT IF A SYRIAN HIS RETURN FROM HERE IN GREECE THEN ONE SYRIAN WILL BE RE LOCATED RE SETTLED FROM TURKEY THEN INTO THE E. USE SO THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT HERE
ON LES BOSS THERE ARE SOME ON THE GREEK EYE ON LES WHAT'S THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE AND IN DETENTION CAMPS AND THEY'RE VERY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE FUTURE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE MANY OF THEM FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY WHO WERE HOPING TO GET FURTHER INTO EUROPE ARE NOW EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT BEING SENT BACK TO TURKEY SEMI JUST DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AND IS IT CLEAR TO YOU SARAH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY JUST REFUSED TO GET ON THE BOATS
WELL BEARING IN MIND THAT THERE IS A HUGE A POLICE ESCORTS WITH EVERY GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE GOING TO WHO ARE GOING TO BE DEPORTED I THINK REFUSING TO GET ON THE BOAT MIGHT BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THAT DESCEND INTO CHAOS VERY QUICKLY WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN THE CAMPS HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL REFUSE TO BE DEPORTED IF IT COMES TO THAT THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE SAYING THAT THEY'LL SET THEMSELVES ON FIRE EVEN PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT RIOT
IF THEY'RE FORCIBLY DEPORTED OBVIOUSLY THE GREEKS OBVIOUSLY THE E.U. WANTS TO AVOID THAT KIND OF SCENARIO THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM WHICH IN WHICH EVERY PERSON WILL HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM AND IT'S ONLY THOSE WHOSE ASYLUM APPLICATIONS ARE REJECTED WILL BE SENT BACK TO TURKEY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT'S GOING TO
THE IMPLEMENT THAT AND OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE IN THE MEANTIME BEING DETAINED HERE ON LET'S BOSS ENCLOSED CAMPS VERY OVERCROWDED CAMPS VERY DIFFICULT FACILITIES VERY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS HERE AS THEY WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR FUTURE WILL MEAN SO THANK YOU THAT'S RANSFORD ON LESBOS LET'S TURN TO THE TURKISH SIDE OF THIS MARK LOAN HAS BEEN GAUGING THE MOOD IN THE TOWN OF DE KEELEY WHICH IS ON TURKEY'S WESTERN COASTS WHERE THOSE FIRST MIGRANTS ARE ABOUT TO GET
THE MAIN SQUARE OF DICKIE LEE IS LIKE MOST TURKISH TOWNS CALLED ATATURK SQUARE IN THE CENTRE A STATUE OF MODERN TURKEY'S FOUNDING FATHER PROUDLY RIDING HIS HORSE AND POINTING TOWARDS THE SEA
THAT'S WHERE THE FIRST BATCH OF MIGRANTS WILL ARRIVE TODAY FROM THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS JUST ACROSS THE AEGEAN BUT IN DICKIE THERE'S SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN HERE ON THE SQUARE THERE'S A TABLE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SIGNING PETITIONS AGAINST A REFUGEE CAMP
I'VE COME TO THE TABLE NOW THERE ARE FEW GUYS AROUND HIM DID YOU SAY THEY DON'T WANT THEY DON'T WANT THIS BALL AND THEN HE DID THE DON'T USUALLY SHOW THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT THE PETITION GOES TO A MAIN CITY
BEING SENT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNORS NOMINATED YOU THEY WANTED PEOPLE SIGNED THE PETITION TODAY WHY DID YOU SIGN THE DOCUMENT BUT
NEEDS A VERY SMALL TOWN ANTHONY CAN'T HANDLE ANY MORE PEOPLE DO VERY THEY LEAVE IS DIFFERENT FROM US AND THEY WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE UNDER REFUSE YOU CAN'T RE DONE TEAM TODAY WILL BE HAPPY HERE AND WE DON'T WANT THEM I WANT TO COME IN THEN YOU HAVE THE EYE LOOK AT THEM THEY CAN'T ACCEPT THEM EVEN THOUGH WE PITY THEM WE WANT TO CARE FOR THEM BUT THEY SHOULD GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OUT OF SIGHT WHERE THEY CAN BE EDDIE'S
BUT AS EVER IN TURKEY OPINIONS ARE DIVIDED ACROSS THE SQUARE I NEED ESSIEN WILL LORD WHO LIVES IN LONDON BUT STILL HAS A HOUSE HERE IN DICKIE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE BANNING COMING HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE HOMELESS AND THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THEM HE SAID OFF DOING THIS KIND OF STUFF WOULD YOU SUPPORT A REFUGEE CAMP HERE YEAH WHY NOT
I DON'T MIND GIVING MY HOUSE IF THEY NEED A HOUSE LIKE A SUMMER HOUSE HERE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE FROM TURKEY WELL ONE DAY WARD MIGHT START HERE
ALONG YES ATATURK ROAD IS THE PUBLIC BEACH AND THE LOCAL BEACH BAR AND EGHAM EN SHUCKING OUT ONE OF THE WAITERS HERE IS WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON HIS BUSINESS WHEN THE MIGRANTS ARRIVE
OH JACKO IT THAT'S IT DONE HE'S PUT US THERE RUBY HAD BEATEN EQUIPMENT ON RUSHOLME THEY'LL SLEEP ON THE BEACH SAW CUSTOMERS WON'T COME WE ARE ALSO WORRIED THERE WILL BE A RISE IN BURGLARIES AND GRAPES SO
BESIDE THE PORT DE LEE A COUPLE OF TENTS HAVE GONE UP TO REGISTER THE FIRST MIGRANTS WHO'LL ARRIVE BUT AFTER THAT WHERE WILL THEY GO WELL THERE'S TALK THAT THE NON SYRIANS WILL GO TO DEPORTATION CENTRES AND THE SYRIANS WERE GOAT TO THE REFUGEE CAMPS ON TURKEY'S SOUTHERN BORDER
THERE'S BEEN A MAD RUSH TO MEET TODAY'S DEADLINE AND STILL THERE ARE MAJOR CONCERNS OVER WHETHER THIS DEAL
WILL HOLD WHETHER IT'S VIABLE OR WHETHER IT'LL ACTUALLY STOP THE MIGRANTS FROM ATTEMPTING THE DESPERATE TRIP ACROSS THE SEA IN THE HOPE OF A NEW
MARK LOWE AND REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE DAILY MAIL BELIEVES THE LEAK OF INFORMATION FROM A LAW FIRM BASED IN PANAMA IS UNPRECEDENTED IT POINTS OUT THAT THE EXTENT OF PRAXIS SEEN BY MANY AS MORALLY DUBIOUS WILL LEAVE MY KAMEN FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE SINCE HE SAID OFFSHORE SCHEMES WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR YEARS AGO
DETAILS AND DOCUMENTS FILLED SEVEN PAGES OF THE GUARDIAN THE PAPER THINKS THE LEEK LIFTS THE VEIL ON THE ROLE PLAYED BY BRITISH TERRITORIES SUCH AS THE CAIMAN AND BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS AND SHOWS HOW A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROTECT THEIR WEALTH TOP TAX DODGERS EXPOSED IS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN
SOME FEARS ARE MISTER CAMERON HE'S SO PREOCCUPIED WITH KEEPING US IN THE E.U. THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT'S HIS JOB TO BE PRIME MINISTER WE WANT COMPETENT SUCCESS AND ACTION THEY MIRROR THINKS HE SHOULD START BY SACKING AS BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGEANT JAVID FOR BEING SPINELESS AND INCOMPETENT BUT THEY ARE I THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARING A MULTI BILLION MOVED TO SAVE BRITAIN'S STEEL INDUSTRY IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES POINTS OUT THAT GERMANY HAS PAID FORTY TIMES MORE THAN THE U.K. AND SUBSIDIES TO HEAVY INDUSTRY SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN
THERE ARE TIMES THAT SIZE THAT POTENTIAL BUYERS OF THE PORT TALBOT WORKS MIGHT BE EMERGING ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE PAPERLESS THE GERMAN COMPANY TYSON CROOKED THE TYCOONS HUNT YOU'VE GOT THE AMERICAN INVESTOR WILBUR ROSS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THINKS MARK AND NATHANIEL MAYER MAY YOUR HOUSE THERE THE PEOPLE BEHIND GREY ABLE MIGHT ALSO HAVE A LOOK AT IT
ECONOMIC PRESSURES MAY BE CAUSING ANXIETIES FOR SOME BUT THE EXPRESS BELIEVES THEY WILL ALSO MEAN BARGAIN HOLIDAYS IN EUROPE FOR MANY THIS SUMMER THE PAPER SAYS THE COST OF EATING OUT BUYING DRINKS OR SOME CREAM HAS FALLEN IN CYPRUS CREATION BULGARIA BY MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AS EUROPE'S ECONOMY STRUGGLE SAYS THE PAPER PRICES ARE TUMBLING TO ANOTHER SIGN OF CHANGE ARE SEEN BY THE TIMES IN SPAIN WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS TO MOVE THE COUNTRY ON TO T. MORE RADICALLY DROP THEIR SIESTA
THE PAPER SAYS SPANIARDS WORK LONGER THAN FOR EXAMPLE THE GERMANS BUT THANKS TO THE THREE HOUR LUNCH BREAK THEY WASTE MORE TIME AND PRODUCE FAR LESS THE TIMES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BUTTON ISATION WILL COME AT A PRICE HEMINGWAY WOULD HAVE A FIT IT COMMENTS WHAT IS SPAIN WITHOUT THE LANGUOR OF THE AFTERNOON WITHOUT THE HOT HOURS SET ASIDE FOR DREAMS SEVERAL OF THE PAPERS HAVE NOTICED AN ATTRACTIVE BUT RATHER PRICEY FOR SALE SIGN AS LONG AS YOU HAVE TWENTY MILLION POUNDS TO SPARE SAYS THE MALE YOU COULD SNAP UP A SLICE OF COUNTRY LIFE THE ENTIRE VILLAGE OF
WEST HESTON IN NORTH YORKSHIRE THAT'S FORTY THREE HOMES A MANOR AND ITS OWN PUB THE TIMES CALLED THE PRICE VERY REASONABLE AND SAYS THE VILLAGE MAYBE AN UNASSUMING SPOT BUT IT IS ONE THAT MODERN LIFE FORGOT THE TELEGRAPH SAYS A LOCAL ESTATE AGENT THINKS TIME HAS STOOD STILL AT WEST HESTER TEN AND IT COMMENTS WOULD BE NICE TO THINK THAT UNDER THE NEXT OWNER IT WILL STAY THAT WAY
THE TIME EXACTLY COURT AT SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING B.B.C. NEWS IS OBTAINED MILLIONS HAVE LEAKED DOCUMENTS WHICH SHOW THAT SOME WORLD LEADERS AND THEIR SUPER RICH HAVE BEEN USING OFFSHORE COMPANIES TO DODGE TAX AND EVADE SANCTIONS CHINA'S ECONOMY IS SLOWING BUT THE COST OF HOUSING CONTINUES TO GO UP AND UP AT LEAST IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NEW FIGURES OUT OF THE END OF LAST WEEK SHOW THE PRICE OF NEW HOMES ARE STILL INCREASING IN THE BIG CITIES LIKE SHANGHAI THAT'S ON TOP OF FIFTEEN PER CENT GROWTH LAST YEAR
BUT HOW WHISKY IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF CHEAP CREDIT AS CHINA TRIES TO DEAL WITH ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT SLOW DOWN IN A GENERATION A CHINA CORRESPONDENT ROBIN BRANDT REPORTS
THIS IS FOOD ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF SHANGHAI
THIS IS A CITY THAT'S HOME TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND WHERE I'M STANDING WELL TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS JUST FEEL
NOW IT'S HOME TO ASIA'S TALLEST BUILDING AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE WHAT ARE GOING TO COST YOU A LOT OF MONEY
I'LL JUST TURN AROUND AND THE REAL ESTATE AGENT BEHIND ME UP THE STEPS HERE THEY HAVE AN ARRAY OF APARTMENTS IN THE SHOP FRONT WINDOW THE PRICIEST
THREE BEDROOMS AND THAT'S GOING TO COST YOU THIRTY THREE MILLION YOU WAN THAT'S JUST OVER FOUR MILLION
HOWARD WHO DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH BUT HE'S IN A HURRY TO BUY MALACHAY MEGAWATT IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR THE RIGHT PAPERWORK THE FRIEND HE'S CHATTING TO HEAR THE SCENE THE VALUE OF HIS APARTMENT GO UP
BY SIXTY PERCENT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT VERY SAID HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
PROUD OF HER VERY HAPPY AT THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT HOWARD IS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPOSING NEW RESTRICTIONS TO TRY TO COOL DEMAND IN THE MEGA CITIES LIKE SHANGHAI BUYERS LIKE HOWARD WILL NEED MORE OF A DEPOSIT NOW BUT AT THE SAME TIME CREDIT IS CHEAP IN CHINA THAT'S A COUNTERMEASURE MEANT TO HELP THERE'S GROWTH IN THE WORLD'S SECOND BIGGEST ECONOMY IS SLOWING BUT
SO HOW FAR WILL HOW WOULD STRETCH HIMSELF TO GET INTO THAT NEW HOME I'M GOING TO BUY HER ON LIKE SEVENTY PERCENT OF HEARTS IN PRICE AND WOULD YOU BORROW FROM ANYWHERE ELSE I MEAN COS AT THE MOMENT WE'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT
IT'S GOT A GREY MARKET IN LENDING DIFFERENT WAYS FOR BORING MONEY THEY CREDITS CHEAP IN CHINA ISN'T IT HER BY THEN BUT THAT THERE WAS MUCH MORE SAFE I DON'T WANT
TUNE MUCH MORTGAGE
THIS CRAZY FROM AUDIO MONTEGO BAY NO WHOA SINCE HAMPSHIRE THIS IS FROM A PROMOTIONAL VIDEO FOR A FINANCE FIRM CALLED LEAF FACT
WE SHALL GO JEAN IT'S ONE OF CHINA'S BIGGEST PEER TO PEER LENDERS A CHALLENGER TO THE BIG STATE BACKED BANKS WHICH PREFER TO LEND TO COMPANIES RATHER THAN PEOPLE BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SPOOKED RECENTLY BY REPORTS THAT SOME BUYERS ARE USING THESE ONLINE PROVIDERS TO PART FINANCED THEIR HOME
HE'S THE HEAD OF RESEARCH IN CHINA FOR THE GLOBAL PROPERTY MANAGERS JONES LANGER SELL HIS DEVON THAT IS SUCH A STRONG ABOUT THERE'S A QUOTE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
THERE'S A PROBLEM IT IS WHERE'S THIS MANAGED WITH HER GOING INTO A RUSTIC I'LL GOING TO EITHER SENATORS ARE COUNTED TO GIVE US AS A RISK I WE ARE KIND OF ME LADS OF INVESTORS ARE GETTING THEN INVEST INTO A REHEARSED IT SO MONEY IS CHEAP AND THERE ARE SOME GROWING CONCERN HERE ABOUT BAD LOANS THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED NEW RESTRICTIONS ON GRAIN MARKET LENDERS BUT IT HASN'T SAID WHAT THOSE WILL BE PRETTY UP IT WILL YOU JOHN WHEN YOU EAT
THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE YAPPED ALWAYS ODD
THE HOUSING MARKET IS IN GOOD HEALTH HOUSING MINISTER CHANGING GIRL SAID RECENTLY BUT HE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED ANOTHER PROBLEM A HUGE INVENTORY OF UNSOLD HOMES
THAT DOES THE OPERA WE'RE GOING TO FATTEN PROPERTY MAY BE A GOOD STORE OF VALUE FOR INVESTORS WHO ARE FEARFUL OF ANOTHER STOCK MARKET DIP IN CHINA
AND SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES THOUGH ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY IT'S FAR MORE DESPERATE THERE ARE NUMEROUS TOWER BLOCKS EVEN TOWNS WITH NO ONE IN THEM FILLING THOSE WITH MORE NEW CITY FOLK REMAINS A KEY AIM FOR CHINA'S LEADERS BUT THEY'RE KEEPING AN EYE AS WELL ON THAT LOOSE CREDIT
BRANDT REPORTING FROM CHINA AT THE TIME ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN A STATE BACKED INSURANCE SCHEME IS BEING LAUNCHED TODAY TO HELP HOUSEHOLDS HIT BY FLOODING THERE'S GOING TO BE A LEVY OF TEN POUNDS FIFTY ON ALL INSURANCE BILLS TO FUND THAT SHARE A COUPLING LIVES IN HEAVEN BRIDGE IN WEST YORKSHIRE SHE WAS FLOODED ON BOXING THEN SHE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING TO A QUITE APART FROM THE EMOTIONAL COST WHICH IMAGINE WAS HIGH WHAT IT WHAT IT ACTUALLY COST YOU THAT BOXING DAY FLAT
WELL IT IS STILL CASTING IT'S GOING TO COST FOR QUITE A WHILE WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED A FIVE THOUSAND
A NEW GRAND BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO VERY FAR I'M AFRAID I DID YOU HAVE ANY INSURANCE NO I KIND OF RELIED ON THE FACT OUT OF THE FLOOD WE WAS MEANT TO COME INTO EFFECT IN A GUEST
AND WHEN I REALISE IT'S LIKE COMING INTO EFFECT I TRY TO MOVE OUR FINE INSURANCE THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT INSURANCE COMPANY NONE WERE WILLING TO
COVER US BECAUSE WE LIVE IN SUCH A FLOOD HIGH FLOOD RISK AREA AND THE FLOOD RE IS THE NAME FOR THE NEW SCHEME AND FOR YOU WHAT WILL IT MEAN WHAT WOULD A ROOM HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED YOU KNOW THAT THE COST WILL BE SOMETHING YOU CAN AFFORD THAT THE REPAYMENTS IF YOU ARE FLOODED WILL BE DECENT
ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL NEWS BUT AFTER ALL IT'S IT'S NOT A VERY SUSTAINABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE PLAN IN THE LONG TERM AND ALONGSIDE IT WE NEED A LONG TERM MEASURE
FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO WAKE UP ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN FLOOD RESILIENCE AND THE BUDGET CUTS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND WATCH HER WAYS
AFFECTED US GREATLY BECAUSE THEY MEANT THAT WE CAN'T PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST WATCH OF PENETRATING OUR HOMES THERE WAS NO OUR MANPOWER TO MAINTAIN THE ROADS COVERT STRAINS AND THEREFORE THE WATCHER PULLED AND PULLED AT THE TERRACE AND FILL THEIR HOMES
IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU PUT IT THAT WAY ROUND COS I IMAGINE THERE'LL BE SOME PEOPLE LISTENING AND THINK WELL MAYBE ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST NOT LIVE IN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF FLOODING WHERE IT IS UNWISE TO LIVE BUT ACTUALLY THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING IS THAT IT IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO LIVE IN THE MYTH IF WE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND DO THE THINGS THAT WE USED TO DO I SUPPOSE TO MAKE SURE THAT FLOODING DOESN'T HAPPEN SOME ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I THINK INSURANCE IS A FALSE ECONOMY BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO
PAY OUT MONEY TO REPLACE THINGS RATHER THAN TO PROTECT THEM AND I I AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE INSURANCE DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT I DO THINK DO VERY IMPORTANT MEASURES NEED TO COME INTO PLACE I WOODLAND TERRACE WHERE YOU LIVE IS A VERY VULNERABLE A COMMUNITY AND AND IT'S LOCATED IN A VERY SUSCEPTIBLE AREA TO FLOODING
WHICH BECAUSE IT'S LOCATED IN A DIP IN THE CALDER VALLEY WE HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF WATER IT WAS SURROUNDING SURROUNDING OUR HOMES AND THEY'RE FOR A PENETRATING OUR HOMES WHAT HAPPENS IS
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY HUGE DERELICT MILLS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREA THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN USING FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND THE WATCHER DOESN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO AND IT DOESN'T REACH THE FLOODPLAINS THINGS LIKE A BIT DEMOLISHING DERELICT MILLS OR
OR JUST OUR MONITORING THINGS LIKE A GROUSE SHOOTING AND THE MORE LAND ART WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO HOW MUCH WATER PENETRATES OUR HOMES AND MAY I JUST MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY YEAH YEAH WOODLAND VIEW PUT A PILOT PROJECT IS A PROJECT THAT AIMS TO BECOME A FLAGSHIP FOR COMMUNITY FLOOD RESILIENCE
AND WE ARE FOOT WE OFFER A TENDER AND CALL OUT ALL FLOOD SPECIALISTS AND FLOOD PROOF EXPERTS TO MAKE US AN OFFER AND TO TURN US INTO A PILOT PROJECT
WHICH WOULD BECOME AN EXEMPTION EXEMPLARY MODEL OF HOW A SMALL COMMUNITY THAT IS HIT BY DEVASTATING FLOODS CAN RECOVER AND BECOME FLOOD RESISTANCE PLEASE VISIT US ON FACEBOOK AND THEN JUST GIVING THE FUNDRAISING RIGHT CROWD RUNNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL WE HOPE AT LEAST SHARE COMING THIRTEEN TOLD US VERY MUCH
SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN WHEN WE WOKE TO A YELLOW DUST COVERING OUR CARS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE WERE TOLD IT WAS SAND FROM THE SAHARA THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED IT AS A NATURALLY OCCURRING WEATHER PHENOMENON BUT NOW IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS MAN MADE ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
SMOG WAS POLLUTION FROM EUROPE WELL ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THAT PAPER PROFESSOR MARK SUTTON FROM THE CENTRE FOR ECOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY JOINS US FROM EDINBURGH GOOD MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR SIR GOOD MORNING WHAT WAS IT THEN
WELL THERE'S A COCKTAIL OF AIR POLLUTANTS HAD OMITTED OVER EUROPE SULPHUR DIOXIDE FROM ENERGY GENERATION NATION OXIDES FROM DRIVING OUR CARS AND AMMONIA FROM AGRICULTURE PUT THOSE GASES ALTOGETHER THEY START REACTING AND FORMING FINE PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE BUT THE CODE DEEP INTO OUR LUNGS
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE VERY BAD NEWS HE'S BAD NEWS IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT HAS GOT BETTER AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN SULPHUR DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BUT THE BIG PROBLEM WE FACE NOW OTHER NATION OXIDES AND THE AMMONIA THE NIGHT'S KNOCK SITE IS HIS LINK TO THAT STORY ABOUT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WILL REMEMBER THE VOLKSWAGEN AND THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS IN REDUCING EMISSIONS BUT IT'S GOT HARDER AND HARDER AS THEY'VE TRIED TO GET FURTHER AND OF COURSE WE DRIVE OUR CARS BIGGER DISTANCES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE AGRICULTURE IS REALLY WHERE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT LIES BECAUSE SO LITTLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE AND COMMITTED BY GOVERNMENTS IN REDUCING THOSE EMISSIONS AND THAT'S WITH THE AMMONIA COMES FROM AGRICULTURE THAT'S RIGHT BUT THIS THERE THE YELLOW DOT ASKED WAS WHAT IS THAT THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE YELLOW DUST WAS I THINK IN MANY CASES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICLES BUT THOSE PARTICLES CONTRIBUTED UP TO IN THE WORST CASE SITUATIONS TWENTY PER CENT OF THE TOTAL
PARTICULATE LOAD THAT WE'RE BREATHING IN THE OTHER THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS THAT THE PARTICLE SIZE IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR HUMAN HEALTH FOR BIGGER PARTICLES AND THAT WAS MORE IN THE DUST EYES DON'T GO SO DEEP INTO THE LUNGS OF THE FINE PARTICULATE MATTER THAT'S LESS THAN TWO POINT FIVE MICRONS OR FIFTIETH OF THE DIAMETER OF A HUMAN HAIR
THAT GOES DEEP INTO YOUR LUNGS AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE AGRICULTURAL TRANSPORT AIR POLLUTANT IS DOMINATING O. K. SO WE LOOK AT THE SAND TO GET WORRIED ABOUT THAT BUT THAT WE SHOULD BE REASONABLY RELAXED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WE'RE NOT BREATHING THAT IN IT EXACTLY IT'S THEM IT'S THE SMALLER STUFF THAT'S MORE WORRYING AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S THE STUFF THAT WE CAN DO STUFF SOMETHING ABOUT HIS
THE AMMONIA WHICH COMES FROM EUROPEAN FARMS WE'VE REALLY SHOWN THAT THIS IS WHERE THE LOW HANGING FRUIT NOW LIES IN A FUTURE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL THAT'S BEING NEGOTIATED AT PRESENT TO REVISE THE WHAT'S CALLED THE NATIONAL EMISSION CEILINGS DIRECTIVE IN EUROPE AND BUILT UPON A UNITED NATIONS AGREEMENT WHAT YOU NEED TO BEAR IN MIND IS AMMONIA IS ACTUALLY NIGHT AND COMPOUND AND NIGHT IS WHAT WE NEED IN FARMING TO GROW OUR CROPS GROW OUR FOOD AS FERTILISER
AND WE'RE LOSING THAT FARMING FERTILISER UP INTO THE AIR AS AMMONIA TO GIVE YOU SOME ROUGH NUMBERS HERE THE TOTAL LOSSES OVERNIGHT FROM FARMING OUT ABOUT THEIR WORTH A FERTILISER STREET VALUE ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION EUROS PER YEAR IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY BUDGETED ABOUT FIFTY FIVE BILLION EUROS
WE'RE LOSING THE EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY BUDGET UP IN SMOKE AND DOWN THE DRAIN AS THESE NIGHTS AND LOSSES AND IN THIS INSTANCE CONTRIBUTING TO AIR POLLUTION

MOST SACK FONSECA SAY THE ALLEGATIONS ARE UNSUPPORTED AND FALSE THEY HAVE ALWAYS COMPLIED WITH INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE COMPANIES ARE NOT USE FOR THIS IT PURPOSES THE PANAMANIAN LEEKS HAVE ALSO CREATED FURTHER DIFFICULTIES FOR FEE FOR JUST SIX WEEKS AFTER ITS NEW PRESIDENT PLEDGED TO CLEAN UP THE ORGANISATION

PEOPLE HERE THOUGH THE DAUGHTER EUROPE IS BEING SLAMMED SHUT ON THEM OFFICIALS HAVE AGREED TO PUBLISH NEW FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COME FROM THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO LIVE IN THE U.K. THE CURRENT FIGURE OF UNDER A MILLIONS SINCE TWENTY TEN IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE NUMBER OF NEW NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS ISSUED OVER THE SAME PERIOD HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE PUBLICATION OF THESE FIGURES JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY INCENDIARY EFFECT ON THE CAMPAIGN AND PROVIDE A HUGE BOOST FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE IF AS EXPECTED THE FIGURES SHOWED THOSE SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS IN ORDER TO WORK
HE'S NEARLY DOUBLED THE NUMBER RECORDED IN THE OFFICIAL FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS IT WILL INEVITABLY FUEL CLAIMS THAT THE TRUE LEVEL OF E.U.

DAME JUDI DENCH HAS WON A RECORD EIGHTH OLIVIER AWARD THEY WERE AWESOME AWARDS FOR KENNETH CRANHAM ANTHONY'S GOLF BUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR MARK RYLANCE DE MASTERS WAS AT THE CEREMONY AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE IN LONDON
DAME JUDI HAS NOW WON MORE ACTING PRIZES THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THEIR FORTY YEAR HISTORY OF THE OLIVIER AWARDS HER RECORD WIN WAS FOR HER SUPPORTING ROLE IN THE KENNETH BRANAGH THEATRE COMPANY PRODUCTION OF THE WINTER'S TALE THE BIGGEST WINNER OF THE NIGHT WAS THE MUSICAL REVIVAL GYPSY WHICH PICKED UP FOR AWARDS INCLUDING BEST ACTRESS IN A MUSICAL FOR IMELDA STAUNTON

MASTERS REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN HAVE A PANAMANIAN LAW COMPANY MON SAC VON SECKER SAYS IT HAS OPERATED BEYOND REPROACH FOR FORTY YEARS IT HAS NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OR CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL WRONG DOING WELL THE COMPANY AND MANY OF ITS CLIENTS CERTAINLY HAVE SOME ANSWERING TO DO THIS MORNING THAT MASSIVE LEAK OF DOCUMENT SEEMS TO SHOW WEALTHY INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD MANAGING TO HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL AFFAIRS
IN SOME CASES ILLEGALLY LAUNDERING MONEY JUDGING SANCTIONS AVOIDING AND EVADING TAX RICHARD BILTON IS THE B. B. C. REPORTER WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ALL OF THIS FOR US AND RICHARD AND DID THAT TAKE US BACK GIVE US THAT THE BACKGROUND TO HOW THIS LEAK HAS HAPPENED OR WHERE IT'S FROM
IS THE SCALE OF THIS LAKE I THINK THAT PROVIDES THIS UNPRECEDENTED GLIMPSE INTO THE SECRET WORLD OF OFFSHORE FINANCE SAMO SACK FONSECA OFFERED FINANCIAL SERVICES LIKE FOUNDATIONS TRUSTS NOMINEE DIRECTOR SHIPS OF COURSE THESE CAN BE USED ILLEGALLY BUT MANY WERE DESIGNED TO HELP CLIENTS HIDE THEIR WEALTH SO THE DOCUMENTS WERE LEAKED TO THE GERMAN NEWSPAPERS TO DEUTSCHE ZEITUNG AND THEN THEY WERE SHARED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS
B.B.C. PANORAMA AND THE GUARDIAN HERE IN THE U.K. ARE AMONG ONE HUNDRED SEVEN MEDIA ORGANISATIONS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THESE DOCUMENTS AND IT'S THE RANGE OF CLIENTS THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE THERE ARE LINKS TO SEVENTY TWO CURRENT OR FORMER HEADS OF STATE INCLUDING DICTATORS LIKE MUBARAK AND GADAFFI AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY WELL ALL RIGHT MY BOROUGH CAN GET THAT YOU SORT OF HALF EXPECT IT OR INDEED COMPLETELY EXPECTED BUT ACTUALLY WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AS WELL
IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T DICTATORS PEOPLE ARE OPERATING IN DEMOCRACIES PEOPLE YOU WOULD EXPECT MORE OF IT AWAY THAT'S RIGHT PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE NOT SURPRISED BY MA'AM BARRACK AND GADAFFI AND ARE SAD
THESE FILES ARE A FALL OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED POLITICIANS AND AND AND BUSINESS FIGURES FROM LITERALLY AROUND THE WORLD WHO WERE TRYING TO HIDE THEIR WEALTH AND TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT IT DOES REVEAL ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING OR TRYING TO
WHAT IS IT THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME EXTRAORDINARY DEALS BEAR IN MIND THIS IS A COMPANY MOST SACK FONSECA THAT PROMISED ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY SO THESE ARE ARRANGEMENTS THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER BE VIEWED BY OTHERS BY THE AUTHORITIES BY ANYONE THE FILES REVEALED A SUSPECTED BILLION DOLLAR MONEY LAUNDERING RING INVOLVING CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF PRESIDENT PUTIN
THE DATA SHOWS HOW ICELANDIC PRIME MINISTER SIGMUND LARKS AND HAD AN UNDECLARED INTEREST IN AN OFFSHORE COMPANY LINKED TO HIS WIFE'S WEALTH THOUGH HE SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG HE FACES CAUGHT
I'LL LET YOU GET RID OF A MAN AND DEMANDED TO KNOW THOSE MORE AS YET BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ABOUT THESE FILES IS THE SORT OF BASIC CASES HIT HERE IN THE U.K. WHERE INDIVIDUALS USE PANAMANIAN TRUSTS AND FOUNDATIONS TO AVOID TAX ON FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTY DEALS IN LONDON RICHARD BROOKS IS A FORMER TAX INSPECTOR WHO NOW WORKS FOR PRIVATE EYE AND HE SAYS THE EVIDENCE IS DAMNING
WHAT THIS SHOWS IS THAT YOU CAN'T RELY ON TAX HAVENS AND THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THERE TO OPEN UP THEY WON'T THEY'LL CARRY ON CONCEALING AS LONG AS THEY CAN OPERATE
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO SHUT DOWN THE TAX HAVEN MODELS IT'S REALLY TIME THAT THE WORLD DIDN'T HAVE TAX HAVEN
GET OUT THERE REALLY THE POINT OF THIS RICHARD THAT IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND INDEED IN A WAY THE EFFORTS THAT A PLAN JUST AREN'T GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH IF IF WE ARE GOING TO BRING ALL OF THIS UNDER SOME KIND OF CONTROL YEAH I MEAN THE NATURE OF THE DEALS THE SORT OF THINGS I'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT THEY'RE VERY EYE CATCHING COS YOU GET TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS
BUT ACTUALLY WHAT'S IN THE FILES IT SHOWS MOST FONSECA UNDERMINING INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THINGS LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS CREATING THIS REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND THAT'S A PUBLIC LIST OF WHO ULTIMATELY OWNS EVERY U.K. COMPANY AND IT'S STANDARD PRACTICE IN INTERNATIONAL FINANCE THE BANK'S LAWYERS ACCOUNTANTS THE KIND I NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH OTHERWISE THEY COULD UNWITTINGLY BE HELPING MONEY LAUNDERING TAX AVOIDS ANYTHING
BUT ONE FILE SHOWS THAT MOST SACK FONSECA WAS SELLING FAKE OWNERSHIP RECORDS TO HIDE A WEALTHY CLIENTS' MONEY AWAY FROM THE AUTHORITIES ROBERT PALMER IS FROM THE CAMPAIGN GROUP GLOBAL WITNESS
WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE FOR HIM WE SHOULD SAY WHAT MUST THAT FONSECA ARE SAYING ABOUT ALL THIS I SAID RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING THEY SAID THEY'D THEY'D DONE NOTHING WRONG FOR FOR FORTY YEARS THERE IN A BIT OF A SPOT OF BOTHER NOW
YEAH I MEAN AS YOU SAY THEY SAY THEY'VE DONE THEY'VE BEEN BEYOND REPROACH FOR FORTY YEARS THEY GO ON TO SAY OFFSHORE COMPANIES ARE AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE WHICH COURSE THEY ARE AND THEY ARE USED FOR A VARIETY OF LEGITIMATE PURPOSES THEY ALSO GO ON TO SAY THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OR CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH CRIMINAL WRONGDOING AND ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY SOLD FAKE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP DETAILS ARE UNSUPPORTED AND FORCE THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE ON THE B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE RIGHT NOW AND HAVE CAUSING SEA THE PANORAMA PROGRAMME TAX HAVENS OF THE RICH AND POWERFUL EXPOSED TONIGHT AT SEVEN THIRTY ON PEOPLE
IT'S NOW FORTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE FIRST BOATS RETURNING MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY HAVE SET OFF IN THE GREEK ISLANDS OF LES BOSS CHAOS AROUND TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE ON BOARD THEM MANY ARE THOUGHT TO BE FROM PAKISTAN AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO LAND AT A PORT ON THE WESTERN COAST OF TURKEY FROM WHERE WE CAN SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT MARK LOWE AND MARK WHAT PROGRESS ARE THEY MAKING
SARAH THEY'RE JUST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED METRES AWAY I'M LOOKING OVER THE BEAUTIFUL INDIAN SEE HERE THAT WAS THE MORNING SUNSHINE GLITTERING OFF THE WATER AND I'M JUST NEXT TO THE PORT OF PARTICULARLY WHERE THESE TWO BOATS ARE DUE TO ARRIVE I'M LOOKING AT ONE
BLUE VESSEL NOW PEPPER A PASSENGER FERRY WHICH IS ACCOMPANIED BY LITTLE COASTGUARD BOAT AND THEN TWIST RIGHT A WHITE PASSENGER FERRY ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY COASTGUARD BOAT AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN HELD JUST AT SEA ABOUT ONE HUNDRED METRES AWAY FROM THERE
THE PORT FOR THE TIME BEING WE UNDERSTAND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PEOPLE ARE ON BOARD MAINLY PAKISTANIS WHO HAD BEEN SENT FROM LES DAWSON LES WHAT ISLAND IN THE DISTANCE SILHOUETTED
JUST A FEW MILES AWAY AND THIS IS THE FIRST BATCH OF THE MIGRANTS WHO WILL ARRIVE BACK HERE IN TURKEY UNDER THIS Y. U. READMISSION AGREEMENT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM ONCE THEY DOCK HERE WELL A COUPLE OF LITTLE TENTS HAVE BEEN SET UP TO MY RIGHT TO REGISTER THE MIGRANTS AND WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT THEN
THE NON SYRIANS PAKISTANIS BANGLADESHIS ON OTHERS WILL BE TAKEN TO DEPORTATION CENTRES THIS ONE IN IS ME ABOUT TWO HOURS' DRIVE AWAY FROM HERE AND THEN DEPORTED UNDER READMISSION AGREEMENTS THAT TURKEY'S BEEN SIGNING OF THE LAST FEW DAYS WHEREAS SYRIANS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM IN GREECE
WILL BE TAKEN TO A REFUGEE CAMPS ON TURKEY SOUTHERN BORDER AND EXCHANGED FOR SYRIANS WHO WILL BE GIVEN FREE PASSAGE DIRECTLY RESETTLED IN EUROPE AS PART OF THE STEEL IS PART OF WHAT'S CALLED THE ONE FOR ONE AGREEMENT AND DO YOU KNOW IT'S DENNY HOW MANY OF THOSE WOULD WE NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS
THE IDEAL WHICH STRUCK IN MARCH WITH THE E.U. IT'S GONNA BE A MAXIMUM OF SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE DIRECTLY SETTLED INTO EUROPE THAT'S FACED QUITE A STIFF OPPOSITION FROM SOME
Y. YOU COUNTRIES MOSTLY IN THE EAST FROM COUNTRIES LIKE HUNGARY AND POLAND THAT SAY THEY DO NOT WANT ANY MORE MIGRANTS HAVE RESETTLED DIRECTLY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND OF COURSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY WE'LL TURKEY BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CARE FOR THESE MIGRANTS PROPERLY IT'S BEEN ACCUSED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ARE FORCIBLY RETURNING SYRIANS BACK TO SYRIA WHICH WOULD VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT REFUTES THAT ALLEGATION MADE BY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SO STILL AND ALL THE CONCERNS OVER WHETHER THIS DEAL WILL HALT
STILL AT WILL WHY PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY ACROSS TO THE GREEK ISLANDS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED WITHIN A DAY ON AVERAGE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO STILL MAKE A JOURNEY SINCE THE DEAL WAS STRUCK IN MARCH IT'S STILL NOT DISCOURAGING HER DESPERATE FROM STILL TRYING TO MAKE THAT ROOM MARK LOWMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN
WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN DO LESS WELL IN THEIR G.C.S.E.S THAN CHILDREN WHERE ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE THAT'S ACCORDING TO REPORT BY THE EDUCATION THINK TANK CENTRE FOR FORUM HE'D FOUND THAT WHILE THEY START SCHOOL AMONG THE HIGHEST ACHIEVERS BY THE TIME THEY REACH SIXTEEN THEY HAVE SLIPPED BELOW TEN OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS NATALIE PEREIRA HE'S THE HEAD OF RESEARCH AT CENTRE FOR HIM AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND TO BE HAPPENING
SO WHAT WE FIND IS AT THE BEGINNING OF SCHOOL IN THE EARLY YEARS WHITE BRITISH PUPILS ARE AMONG THE TOP THREE IF YOU RANK THE PERFORMERS AT THE END OF RECEPTION
BY THE END OF SECONDARY SCHOOL THEY FALL TEN PLACES AND WE FIND THAT JUST OVER A THIRD OF WHITE BRITISH PUPILS OVER ACHIEVING A WORLD CLASS STANDARD SO WHO'S ABOVE THEM CHINESE PUPILS INDIAN PUPILS BLACK AFRICAN PUPILS OTHER ASIAN PUPILS AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S HAPPENING
WELL I THINK THE THERE'S THE PICTURE IS NEXT AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME RESEARCH THAT FINE
THAT WHITE ETHNIC MINORITY FAMILIES TEND TO HAVE THE HAD MORE TOOLS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN SO THINGS LIKE ATTENDING PARENTS' EVENING SUPPORTING CHILDREN WITH THEIR HOMEWORK HAVING REGULAR ROUTINES AND STRUCTURES AT HOME BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT ONE OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GROUP
PUPILS WHO HAVE IMPROVED THE MOST OVER THE PAST DECADE IT IS ACTUALLY THE WHITE WORKING CLASS SO THEY ARE IMPROVING BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT AMONG THE TOP PERFORMERS YET O.K. SO THE GAP IS NARROWING BETWEEN THAT ONCE THEY SLIPPED BELOW OTHERS WHO HAVE ENGLISH AS AS PERHAPS A SECOND OR EVEN THIRD LANGUAGE THE GAP IS NARROWING
WELL THEY THEY'RE IMPROVING THE MOST IF YOU LOOK AT HOW OUR PUPILS HAVE IMPROVED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT WHAT'S REALLY STRIKING IS IF YOU LOOK AT DISADVANTAGE PUPILS AS A WHOLE SO REGARDLESS OF COLOUR COLOUR IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOST DEPRIVED PUPILS AS DEFINED BY FREE SCHOOL MEALS ELIGIBILITY
EIGHTY PERCENT OF PUPILS ARE FAILING THE WORLD CLASS TALENTED AT SECONDARY SCHOOL
SO WHAT IT'S THE THE MOST DISADVANTAGED WHO ARE IN THE WORST SITUATION THAT'S CORRECT EIGHTY PER CENT THAT'S FOUR OUT OF FIVE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE THAT HASN'T IT IT HAS BEEN THE CASE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THE GAP IS NOW OWING
IT HAS BEEN A RING VERY SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THAT'S PROMISING BUT THEY'RE STILL FURTHER TO GO IF WE WANT DISADVANTAGED PUPILS TO HAVE THE SAME OUTCOMES AS THEIR PARENTS BY THE END OF SECONDARY PUPILS DISADVANTAGE PUPILS NINETEEN MONTHS BEHIND THEIR PEERS
NATALIE PEREIRA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH TIMES TWENTY SEVEN A STATE BACKED INSURANCE SCHEME TO HELP HOUSEHOLDS HIT BY FLOODING LAUNCHES TODAY WE WERE HEARING FROM SATISFIED POTENTIAL CUSTOMER HALF AN HOUR SIR GO JOE IS HERE WITH MORE DETAILS OF HOW IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK YEAH THANKS JUST THE OTHER SCHEME WITH THE IMAGINES HER IMAGINATIVE TITLE OF FLOOD RE WILL BE FUNDED BY HOME INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HOPES TO KEEP INSURANCE PREMIUMS DOWN FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOMEOWNERS
IN FLOOD PAROLE PRONE AREA SPREADER MACAVITY IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FLOOD RE GOOD MORNING BRENDAN GOOD MORNING JO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US HOW THE SYSTEM WILL WORK SURE SO FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF A PERSON BUYING A POLICY THERE'S REALLY NO CHANGE AT ALL THE WAY THEY BUY THE POLICY IN THE WAY THAT THEY MAKE THAT CLAIM IS UNCHANGED AND WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TODAY IS TALK TO THE INSHORE AND FIND OUT WHAT APPROACHED INSURER IS TAKING TO FLUTTERY AND IF NECESSARY SHOP AROUND
FLOOD RE SITS IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU'VE SAID WE WE WE WE PAY FOR THIS BY USING A TAX THE REVENUE OF ATTACKS HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR
AND WE USE THAT TO PAY THE CLAIMS ON THEIR POLICIES ARE SENT TO US BY THE INSURERS SO EFFECTIVELY WERE ENSURING THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEN WE LAY OFF SOME OF THE WRIST OF THE GLOBAL REINSURANCE MARKETS THE WHOLESALE MARKETS AND THAT GIVES YOU A REINSURANCE WORTH TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS OR OPTED THAT AT LEAST WHAT IF THERE'S A MAJOR FLOOD EVENT IN LONDON OR THE SOUTH EAST IS THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH
WE'VE WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD WITH THE FINANCIAL REGULATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF A RISK AND I'M VERY VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE WEATHER EVENTS ACROSS THE U.K. NOT JUST THE SOUTH EAST IN EXCESS OF A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED YEAR EVENT
WE'VE GOT ALL OF THAT DOWN TO A LEVEL OF PRECISION BUT OF COURSE WE WON'T SEE EVERY RISK THAT'S EXPOSED TO FLOODING THE INSURERS WILL CONTINUE TO RETAIN AS VERY SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THAT RICH THEMSELVES NOW THE INSURERS ARE GOING TO PAY THIS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS A YEAR CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLOOD REFUND THEY'RE GOING TO PASS THAT ON TO CONSUMERS THOUGH AREN'T THEY
THEY MAY WELL AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'VE GOT TO I.P. T. INSURANCE PREMIUM TAX CHANGES FLOWING THROUGH THE SYSTEM RECENTLY AS WELL WHICH ARE CONSUMERS WILL HAVE TO PAY INDEED THAT GO THAT'S PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MARKET HERE IN THE HOUSEHOLD MARKETPLACE AT LEAST PRICES HAD REDUCED I THINK BY ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE PERCENT IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND MORE THAN THAT LAST FIVE SO IT'S A VERY VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET LIKES YOU'RE HOPING THAT THEY WILL PASS IT ALL ON A FINAL QUESTION
DOES FLOOD RE MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS OFF THE HOOK WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING FLOOD DEFENCES THAT WAS PART OF THE OLD SYSTEM WASN'T IT WELL WE'VE BEEN VERY CAREFUL IN THE WAY THAT WE DESIGN FLOOD FLUTTERY ANY PROPERTY THAT WAS BUILT AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCHEME SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR IN'T FOR PROPERTY DEVELOPERS TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THE PROPERTIES THEY DEVELOP CAN BE ENSURED OH KAY THAT'S BRENTON MACAVITY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FLOOD THANK YOU

TO USE AS A SKATE CATS PERP ESCAPE PLAN BUT MORE GENERALLY I THINK WHAT'S FASCINATING THIS IS HIS EXPLAIN EXPLANATION OF WHY HE WAS NEVER FOUND OUT IS FIRSTLY THE ESTABLISHMENT AND SECONDLY

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO TO SAVE OF THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY OR AT LEAST PARTS OF IT UNIONS WE WILL BE MEETING IN LONDON TODAY IN CARDIFF THE WELSH ECONOMY MINISTER EDWINA HEART WILL BE CHAIRING THE STEEL TASK FORCE THAT'S MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM INDUSTRY UNIONS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHE JOINS US FROM SWANSEA NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THEIR VARIOUS REPORTS IN THE PAPERS TODAY OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF TAT OR DEAL WHAT WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THE POSSIBLE BUYERS FOR IT AND INDEED WHETHER IT CAN BE SAVED BY OUR INDIVIDUAL STEPPING IT WAS QUITE CLEAR FROM THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD ON FRIDAY AT THE PLANT SOUP AT ALL BUT WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND THE WORKFORCE AND THE SECRETARY THE STATE THAT WE HAVE TO TRY AND KEEP THE BUSINESS IS A HALL
AS A SIMPLETON STRATEGIC CAN WE HAVE A STEEL BUSINESS IN THE U.K. FOR DEFENCE NUCLEAR AND VARIOUS OTHER REASONS OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST OUT AND ABOUT WE'RE AWARE OF SOME EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST BUT THE IMPORTANT THING NOW THE TOP HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER NOW HER SPEAR RESPONSIBLE CELLAR SO WE NEED TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION WE REQUIRE FROM TARTARE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HELP AND ASSIST ANY BID THAT COMES FROM SOMEONE AND IN THE MEANTIME SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT STEP IN
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF ASSISTANCE AREN'T INTERVENTION BUT WHAT WE NEED TO PUT IT WHEN I SAY SLIP AND I'M WONDERING ABOUT NATIONALISING SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT BE STEPPING IN AND BUYING IT EVEN HAVE TEMPORARILY WELL I THINK WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE FACTS AND FIGURES ARE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK GOING ON WITH TART ON A TURNAROUND PLAN THEY'VE EMPLOYED MCKINSEY WE NEED TO SEE THAT TURNAROUND PLAN HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO VARIOUS PEOPLE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CERTAIN ISSUES THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH IN THE SHORT TERM IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEM WITH COSTS
WHY WE LOOK FOR A BUYER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT STATE INTERVENTION AT THAT PARTICULAR STAGE YOU MENTIONED THERE ABOUT TARTAR BEING A RESPONSIBLE CELLAR AND ABOUT SEEING THE MACKENZIE REPORT THAT'S DONE FOR IT ARE THEY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT AND STUFF OVER WELL OBVIOUSLY I'VE DISCUSSED IT WITH THE U.K. GOVERNMENT THESE ISSUES AND U.K. GOVERNMENTS ARE IN CLOSE CONTACT LIKE OUTSELLS SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO GET THE INFORMATION SO WE CAN MAKE IT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE DEAL THAT WE CAN
THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND THE PLANTS THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH AND A LOT OF WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND HOW THEY CAN REDUCE COSTS HOW THEY BECAME WILL BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND OF COURSE THEIR ISSUES ABOUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A POWER PLANT WITH A BUT AND ALL THIS TYPE OF STUFF AND HE'S NOW TO BE DEALT WITH SO THAT ANY PERSPECTIVE BUYER CAN SEE WHAT SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE BUT I'M STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT
ALMOST IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THOSE REPORTS SHOW THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP IN AND CONSIDER NATIONALISING I THINK HE SHOULD STEP IN AND CONSIDERED THE INTERVENTION AND WE'VE ALREADY INDICATED THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY OUR PART IN THIS BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO SEE WHAT FIGURES THERE ARE I THINK HE SEES YOU HAVE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT NATIONALISATION OR TAKE OVER THE PROUD TOMORROW
YOU STILL HAVE THOSE LOSSES WHAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT IS THE LONG TERM FUTURE FOR THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THE INDUSTRY AND WE SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT PUT THE PLANT'S GOING TO CLOSE WE'VE GOT TO BE POSITIVE THAT PLANT KNOCK ON THE CLAWS THE STEEL INDUSTRY ISN'T WHAT NOT HER CLAWS DOWN BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMING ABOUT SERIOUS ABOUT A MANUFACTURING POLICY IT HAS TO SUPPORT THE STEEL INDUSTRY NOW O.K. WE'LL HAVE TO SUPPORT IT IN TERMS OF CASH SO WHAT COULD INTERVENTION WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE I THINK INTERVENTION COULD MEAN WHATEVER MONEY THEY REQUIRE IN THE SHORT TERM TO HELP
TO HELP IN THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS THEY'LL SEE THE INVESTMENT IN PLANT AND MACHINERY IS OLD PLANT IN TERMS OF THE WORKS OF THE BUT SO IS ISSUES LIKE THAT OH O.K. STAY THERE IF YOU WOULD ORDER IN A HEART ALL IN CARDIFF IS THE LEADER OF THE WELSH CONSERVATIVES ANDREW DAVIES GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE ANSWER TO TO KEEP THE INDUSTRY GOING
I THINK WATCHING STUDIED GAVIN'S INTERVIEW YESTERDAY ON I ANDREW MARSH GAVE ME HUGE CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE CREATING THE SPACE FOR SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS TO ACTUALLY BE UNDERTAKEN WITH INTERESTED PARTIES THIS WEEK I UNDERSTAND TATA STEEL WILL BE LAUNCHING THEIR PERSPECTIVES FOR SALE AND THAT WILL BRING FORWARD ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT A PORTRAIT PROTECT POTENTIAL SALE BUT IT IS VITAL AT GOVERNMENT PLAYS ITS ROLE IN CREATING THE SPACE
DISCUSSING WITH PURCHASES WHAT IT CAN DO PROACTIVELY ON ENERGY COSTS AROUND PENSIONS AND AROUND THE PLANT AS WELL SO THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS THERE THAT THE SUCCESSFUL PERCHE CANCER WERE THESE JOBS WERE MAKING THE PURCHASE FROM WHAT FROM THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD EARLIER ON THE PROGRAMME IT WAS A GIVEN THAT THE PENSION FUND WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE TAKEN ON BY THE GOVERNMENT BY THE PURTY PENSION PROTECTION FUND SO ARGUABLY IT'S WHAT ELSE CAN BE DONE TO MAKE IT A VIABLE BUSINESS
AND WHERE DID WEAR WHAT INTERVENTION DO YOU SEE THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING I THINK THERE'S THREE THINGS THEY'RE THE FIRST THING IS AROUND ENERGY PRICES WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT FIVE TO TEN PER CENT OF THE PRODUCTION COSTS ALREADY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION POUNDS APPROXIMATELY HAS BEEN REBATED BACK TO HIGH ENERGY USERS OF WHICH TATA STEEL HAVE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION REBATED THERE WASN'T WITHOUT CEMENT IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AGAIN ON SOMEBODY'S ENERGY COST AREAS
WHICH WOULD SEE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OVER THE LIFETIME OF THIS PARLIAMENT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STEEL SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THIS BUSINESS RATES WHICH HAS BEEN A CONSTANT THORN IN THE SIDE OF STEEL MAKERS AND THAT WOULD BE A ROLE FOR THE WELSH GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE ASKS AND SORT OF PROGRESS CAN BE MADE ON THAT GREATER PUBLIC BITUMEN
BUT ALSO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AROUND TARIFFS WE DO KNOW THAT SOME TYRUS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED ALREADY ON ROW BAR FOR EXAMPLE ROBUST STEEL WHICH IS USED FOR REINFORCING PRODUCTS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN LEVELLING THE FIELD OTHER AREAS NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL
ANDREW DAVIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD WIN A HEART WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO ON BUSINESS RATES MENTORS HAVE BEEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEVOLVED TO WALES WHERE WE STILL HAVE TO OPERATE WITHIN THE STATE AID GUIDE CLANGS AS THE CASE ACROSS THE U.K. AND THERE'S A DE MINIMUS THROUGH I THINK IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO SUE THOUSAND EUROS ON A THREE YEAR PERIOD WE'VE ALSO LOOK AT THE ISSUES AROUND CLASSES A PLANT AND MACHINERY COULD THEY BE MILLED FROM THE RATINGS WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VALUE NATION THE AGENCY ON THOSE ISSUES SO THOSE ISSUES ARE ALL IN HAND
ALSO IN TERMS OF ENERGY COSTS RISE WE WELCOME THE CHANCERS ANNOUNCEMENT WE'VE BEEN ON ABOUT ENERGY COS FOR YEARS THE FIRST MINISTER RAISED THIS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO IT IS THERE THERE IS A SCHEME BUT IT IS I THINK A LITTLE LITTLE SMALL A LITTLE TOO LATE IN VERY REAL TERMS AND IF THE PENSIONS ISSUE CAN BE DEALT WITH THAT GOOD NEWS BUT IN TERMS OF ANYBODY COMING TO THE U.K. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WILL BE THE HELP AND ASSISTANCE THEY MIGHT REQUIRE AT WHAT ARLETTE IMPLANT DIVE UNPOLITICALLY PARTICULARLY BUSINESS RATES ARE YOU BEING HAMPERED BY WHAT THE E.U. WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO
NO I CAN WE MUSTN'T USE THE WORD HAMPERS THE SURPRISE ALL ACROSS THE SCOTS HAVE HAD THE SIMILAR POSITION IN TERMS IN TERMS OF BUSINESS RATES AS OURSELVES AND OBVIOUSLY NOW WHAT ARE OUR HOPE IS THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF VALUATION AND FURTHER STUFF PEOPLE VERY BLAND THEY SAY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ON BUSINESS RATES YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ON PLANT AND MACHINERY BUT YOU'VE GOT TO RECOGNISE THERE ARE RULES THE CABINET AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE NESTS AND CRIES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAD TO DO THINGS
WE'VE BEEN AWARE FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE ISSUES AND TATA STEEL WE HAVE PRAYED HARD WITH THE COMPANY WE'VE HAD GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHERE THEY WERE GOING THEIR AGENDA AND WE'VE ALSO HELPED AND ASSISTED THEM PREVIOUSLY SO I WAS QUITE RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S U.K. GOVERNMENT TAKES THE LEAD ON THIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE SEE THE U.K. GOVERNMENT FIGHTING FOR STEEL EDWINA HEART WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU
AND AT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS AS IMMIGRANTS START BEING DEPORTED FROM GREECE TO TURKEY THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE CRUNCH HAS ARRIVED THE REPUTATION OF EUROPE NOW RESTS IN THE HANDS OF THE GREEK OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH SENDING PEOPLE BACK
FOR THE TIME SAYS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY OF THEIR TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION SYRIANS NOW LIVING IN TURKEY TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO FLED OR UNDER THREAT THE PAPER DOESN'T THINK THERE CAN BE A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE WITHOUT PEACE SINCE
THE SUN BELIEVES A DECISION BY CIVIL SERVANTS TO REVEAL THE TRUE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS IN BRITAIN COULD HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE IMPACT ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THERE'S BEEN A BIT A ROW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL FIGURE OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARRIVALS SINCE TWENTY TEN AND THE FACT THAT IN THAT TIME TWO POINT TWO MILLION NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO INCOMERS FROM THE E.U.
THE EXPRESS EXPECTS THE REVISED NUMBERS IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AN UPWARD REVISION COULD SAYS THE TELEGRAPH PROVIDE A DRAMATIC LATE BOOST FOR THE OUT CAMPAIGN A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT BY THE SUN SUGGESTS THAT CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED THE EARTHQUAKE IN THERE PAUL HAD BEEN SOLD INTO SLAVERY FOR AS LITTLE AS FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY POUNDS THE PAPER SAYS SOME AS YOUNG AS TEN HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY BRITISH FAMILIES THE HOME SECRETARY TELLS HER PAPERS SHE'S DETERMINED TO TACKLE THE GANGS BEHIND THE TREE
AND THE DAILY MIRROR REVEALS THAT AMONG THE TOP STARS TAKING TO THE STAGE AT THIS YEAR'S GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL WILL BE JEREMY CORBIN THE LABOUR LEADERS BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK ABOUT NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT OR D. HELP TO ESTABLISH THE BEST WILL IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE PAPER OFFERS AN IMAGE OF HOW HE MIGHT LOOK AS THE BASS PLAYER IN A ROCK BAND AND IMAGINES THE SONGS HE MIGHT SING PART OF THE UNION LABOUR OF LOVE AND ANYTHING BY SIMPLY
IT IS SEVENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT AND A STORY NOW RED LIPS AND RED TAPE IT'S THE STORY OF HOW Y. YOU HEALTH AND SAFETY LEGISLATION WHICH BRITAIN HAS HELPED TO DRAW UP OVER THE YEARS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE WAY THAT WE BUY IN VAST QUANTITIES EVERY DAY IS THE LATEST IN OUR SERIES ON HOW MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. AFFECTS OUR BUYING OF EVERYDAY OBJECTS
LIPSTICK WE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE STUFF THAT ONE HUNDRED POUND IN TOTAL MADAM AT THE LAST COUNT THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY INTO
WAS WORTH SEVENTEEN BILLION
THAT'S CAROLINE NEVILLE PRESIDENT OF THE TRADE FOR THE COSMETIC EXECUTIVE WOMEN IT EMPLOYS OVER A MILLION PEOPLE
AND VERY IMPORTANTLY TO US THE U.K. BRAND
WHO ARE EXPORTING BRITISH PRODUCT THAT'S INCREASING BY FIVE PER CENT EVERY YEAR
THAT'S GOING TO GUS THEY'VE GOT TINY LIGHTS IN THE LID I DON'T IF YOU CAN SEE THAT IS THERE THIS IS ALICE HART DAVIS A COSMETICS JOURNALIST AND WRITER THERE'S ALSO A HANDY MIRROR ON THE SIDE
OF THE LIP GLOSS TUBE SO THERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR MIRROR HERE YOU'VE GOT YOUR LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE DOING PAINTED ON
AND WHERE DO WE SELL TO EUROPE IS THE BIGGEST MARKET FOR BRITISH BRANDS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FRANCE IS BIGGER THAN US THEY HAVE ANOTHER VERY BIG NAMES WE
BIG CREATIVE WHO'LL HERE AND THERE'S NEW THINGS ALL THE TIME
LIPSTICK GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF A WINDOW ON THE WORKINGS OF THE Y. YOU CALL IT RED LIPS AND RED TAPE
REWIND TO THE ELIZABETHANS THEY USED FACE ENAMELLING PRODUCTS WHICH CONTAINED LEAD AND EVEN ARSENIC THEY WOULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT HAD THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY BEING AROUND
BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX BRITAIN AND THE REST OF THE E. C. DEVISED NEW COSMETICS SAFETY STANDARDS THEY CALLED THEM THE EUROPEAN COSMETICS DIRECTIVE
A DIRECTIVE IS A LEGISLATIVE ACT THAT SETS US A GOLD THAT ALL E.U. COUNTRIES MUST ACHIEVE HOWEVER IT IS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO DEVISE THEIR OWN LAWS ON HOW TO REACH THESE GOALS SO EUROPE DREW UP A LIST OF SUBSTANCES WHICH COULD NOT BE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF COSMETICS AND THEN WESTMINSTER WORKED OUT HOW BEST TO BAN THOSE SUBSTANCES UNDER U.K. LAW
FAST FORWARD TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WHEN THE DIRECTIVE WAS REPLACED BY THE E. USE REGULATION ON COSMETIC PRODUCTS ARE REGULATION IS A BONDING LEGISLATIVE
IT MUST BE APPLIED IN ITS ENTIRETY ACROSS THE YOU IN OTHER WORDS ONCE THE E.U. INCLUDING ON MINISTERS AND MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OF COURSE HAD AGREED ON THE RULES FOR COSMETICS EUROPEAN LAW TRUMPETER A DOMESTIC RULES IT MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO SOME BUT ACTUALLY THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY WELCOMES THE REGULATION AS IT DID THE DIRECTIVE
THAT'S DOCTOR CHRIS FLOWERS FROM THE COSMETIC TOILETRY AND PERFUMERY ASSOCIATION SOME PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THE VIEW THAT THE EUROPEAN CONSUMERS AT A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE REGULATION BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE GLOBAL CONSUMER IS SEEING EUROPEAN PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND OF HIGH QUALITY AND IS NOW DEMANDING THAT FROM THEIR OWN PRODUCTS
IT'S THE RULES ONLY APPLY TO PRODUCTS BOUGHT OVER THE COUNTER BUT DO YOU LIKE YOUR RECEIPT IN THE BAG AT ALL AND INCREASINGLY WE ARE BUYING A LIPSTICK ON LINE A BIG CONCERN NOT JUST FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND ALL THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES OR COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
AND WHEN YOU GO TO SITES THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THERE IS A HIGHER RISK THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT THE GENUINE ARTICLE SO COULD THIS BE AN EXAMPLE OF EUROPEAN RULES ONLY A FEW YEARS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN WRITTEN FAILING TO GET TO GRIPS WITH THE REALITIES OF THE GLOBAL MARKET PLACE IN WHICH WE ALL NOW OPERATE IF SO NO AMOUNT OF MAKE UP IS GOING TO HELP IN COVERING UP THAT PARTICULAR IMPERFECTION
PRICE REPORTING WITH THIS AGAINST THE SOUND OF KISSING THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A LEAD STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF LEEDS NICK BAINES GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
CALL ME BIASED BUT THIS SEASON HAS TO BE THE BEST FOR FOOTBALL FANS EVERYWHERE I LIVED IN LEICESTER FOR NINE YEARS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES SO I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE WAS LOOKING A LITTLE BIT UPSIDE DOWN AND I SAY THAT AS CONVINCED CLOP RIGHT
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF APHORISMS ABOUT SPORT IN GENERAL AND FOOTBALL IN PARTICULAR BUT AND I FEEL THIS MIGHT BE ALMOST BLASPHEMOUS BILL SHANKLY WAS WRONG WHEN HE CLAIMED THAT FOOTBALL WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH OF COURSE IN HISTORY SPORT WASN'T QUITE THE BIG BUSINESS IT IS TODAY AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE LIES
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE SEEN A CRISIS AND WORLD ATHLETICS OVER DOPING THE HIGH EARNING TENNIS PLAYER MARIA SHARAPOVA HAS HAD TO STEP BACK AND JUST NOW LOST A NUMBER OF LUCRATIVE SPONSORSHIP DEALS AND NOW WE SEE ALLEGATIONS WILL BE STRONGLY DENIED ABOUT FURTHER DOPING IN MAJOR SPORTS INCLUDING PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL
SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS HERE A TOKEN THIS ONE THING BUT THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT YOU PAINT
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT TO WIN BY CHEATING WHATEVER FORM THAT TREATING TAKES HIS ALWAYS FAILURE AT THE REAL PROBLEM IS NOT WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS THE PROSPERING WITH THE WICKED BUT RATHER THE WICKEDNESS OF THOSE WHO PROSPER IT'S THE DUPING RATHER THAN THE TOE PRINTED COURSE IT'S THE ULTIMATE OFFENCE WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN NOT TO LIE OR DECEIVE HER MORAL GOODSON THEMSELVES THAT IS SURELY RIGHT
BUT THEN WILLIAM DE END UP WATCHING THEIR ROLE MODELS PARTICULARLY ON THE FOOTBALL PITCH DIVING THAN DYING ON THE GRASS SO WE SHOULD SURELY BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY THAN LOST SPONSORSHIP DEALS AND SEE SPORTSMEN AND WOMEN MORE EMBARRASSED ABOUT SHAME THAN ABOUT ILLICIT POINTS GAINED ORDEALS SLOPS
I REALISE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OTHER DIMENSIONS TO THE SOLE BUSINESS SPORT IS NEVER SIMPLY ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING I HAVE A CERTAIN SYMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO TAKE ALLOWABLE DRUGS ONE DAY ONLY TO FIND THE BALL WAS LEGAL VENICE NOW TEAMED ILLICIT TODAY
AGAIN IF THE MORAL COMPLAINT HAS TO DO ONLY WITHIN EQUITY ON THE PART OF THOSE COMPETING AND WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THOSE IMBALANCES AND UNFAIRNESS IS INHERENT TO SPORT ANYWAY FOR EXAMPLE LEAVING DRUGS ASIDE THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR TEAMS WITH THE MOST MONEY AT THEIR DISPOSAL WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE BEST SUPPORT AND RESOURCING THE RICHER INEVITABLY ADVANTAGE OVER THOSE WERE MORE POORLY FUNDED
WELL ONE AMERICAN SPORTSMEN ONCE SAID THAT SPORTS DO NOT BUILD CHARACTER THEY REVEAL IT
NO SURPRISE THEN THE SIM THEOLOGICAL CIRCLES CHARACTER ETHICS OR DE RIG THESE DAYS SPORT MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME VERY OLD ETHICS FOR A NOT SO NEW WORLD CHARACTER MATTERS MORE THAN CHARISMA OR EVEN A CABINET OF MEDALS
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH NICK BAINES IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE SUNDAY TIMES REVEALED OVER THE WEEKEND BUT A LONDON BASED PRIVATE DOCTOR MARK BONNAR HAS BEEN PRESCRIBING BAND PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS TO OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY BRITISH ATHLETES DOCTOR BONNER SAYS HE IS DONE
NOTHING WRONG INDEED HE HAS SAID IN A STATEMENT I DO NOT DOPE OR TREAT PATIENTS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT EVEN THOUGH THESE TREATMENTS MAY ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AS A SECONDARY EFFECT U.K. ANTI DOPING THE BODY THAT IS MEANT TO KEEP BRITISH SPORT CLEAN ADMITS THAT IT DID BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION INTO DOCTOR BONNER BUT THEN IT DECIDED
IT DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO TAKE THE MATTER ANY FURTHER AND IT DROPPED IT LORD MOYNAHAN HUNT COLIN MINE HUNT FORMER CONSERVATIVE SPORTS MINISTER AND INDEED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH OLYMPIC ASSOCIATION FOR THE TWENTY TWELVE GAMES IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU VERY GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEIR ROLE IN ALL OF THIS OR LACK OF ROLE PERHAPS OF THE BRITISH ANTI DOPING AUTHORITY AUTHORITIES YOU KADY
I THINK THERE ARE A WHOLE SERIES QUESTIONS THAT JOHN WE TYNDALE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO RAISE YESTERDAY THIS WAS THE NEXT LINK THE MINISTER YES AND TO LAUNCH AN INQUIRY INTO WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE ACTION COMPLETING COMPREHENSIVE ACTION ON WHAT WERE HIS SERIES OF FOG REACHING ALLEGATIONS ACROSS SPORT BUT THE SECOND POINT I'D MAKE IS THAT IN THERE WERE SPONSORS THEY DID SAY THAT THEY WERE GRATEFUL TO JOURNALISTS UNEARTHING INFORMATION
WHICH AUTHORITIES AND I QUOTE LIKE YOU COULD YOU CAD WHICH IS THE NATIONAL ANTI DOPING AGENCY HERE DO NOT HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO PURSUE AND AND I LAUNCHED A PETITION IN THE SUNDAY TIMES YESTERDAY TO BRING FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT JURISDICTION AND ALSO WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY
WHEN SOMEBODY KNOWINGLY TAKES A COCKTAIL OF DRUGS TO CHEAT A CLEAN ATHLETE OUT OF SELECTION THEY ARE AND SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL LAW BECAUSE THEY'RE DUE ORDERING THAT CLEAN ATHLETE WITH THAT WOULD BE IN THE FUTURE FOR THIS FOR THIS INVESTIGATION OR NON INVESTIGATION COS THEY DROPPED IT THEY SAY THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PROCEED
THAT'S WHAT THE WAITING DOWLING INQUIRY WILL DISCOVER AND IT WOULD BE WRONG TO COME TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THAT AND BEFORE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE EVIDENCE CERTAINLY ON A
COMPREHENSIVE REED OF THEIR SUNDAY TIMES YESTERDAY THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE VERY SERIOUS MISJUDGEMENTS HERE AND POOR MANAGEMENT PAUL REPORTING STRUCTURES IN PLACE YOU CARROT WHICH ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED DO YOU KNOW DO YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THEY ARE UND COMPLIANT
I'M UNDER SECTION FIVE OF THE ANTI DOPING CODE NOW THAT IS A SERIOUS CHARGE ISN'T IT THAT COVERS INVESTIGATIVE POWERS IT COVERS REPORTING IT WOULD BE A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS IF THEY WERE FOUND TO BE DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE I THINK THERE MIGHT BE
ON MY READ OF SECTION FIVE OF THEO AND WILDER CODE WHICH IS THE WORLD ANTI DOPING ASSOCIATION CODE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY WERE A STRONG GROUNDS TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY ARE NON COMPLIANT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND YESTERDAY'S SUNDAY TIMES ONE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT THEN WOULD BE THE INFERIOR PLACE WE COULD BE CHUCKED OUT OF THE REAR GAMES IN THEORY THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY I THINK WHAT WADDA SHOULD DO TODAY HIS CALL FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ENQUIRY OF THEIR OWN THEY'RE DUTY BOUND TO DO THAT AFTER HIS ALLEGATIONS
ONCE THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT ENQUIRY WHICH SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG THEY WILL WANT TO SEE CHANGES MADE TO YOU CATS REPORTING STRUCTURE SO THAT THIS CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN UNDER SECTION FIVE AND THEN SOON AFTER THAT THEY WILL BECOME COMPLIANT AGAIN AND OUR ATHLETES WHO THEY ARE THERE TO SERVE WOULD BE ON THE PLANE TO RIO LOBO THEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAS TURNED TO SIR CRAIG REEDY WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY AND IS ALSO ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WELL I'M HAPPY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTRODUCE AN INQUIRY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES I NOTE TO THAT BEAUTY ANTI DOPING HAVE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY DI AGREE WITH COLIN MOYNIHAN LOOK WE SHOULD WAIT
I SEE EXACTLY WHAT THESE INQUIRIES PRODUCE DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE I WON'T COMPLIANT TO USE THIS THIS THIS UGLY WORD BUT NONE THE LESS IMPORTANT THE WORD AND IN WHICH CASE IS THERE A THREAT TO BRITAIN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE OLYMPICS
WHAT CAN I DO YOU WERE IN C. SECTIONS THE FIRST IS THAT THIS WHOLE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A CASE OF SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE SOUGHT BY A SPORTSMAN AND NOW THIS INVOLVES CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND INTELLIGENCE BY THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO GO PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED AND IT IS THAT ELEMENT THAT YOU I'D SEE IS THAT THEY HAD INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT
AT LEGISLATIVE POWERS TO TRICK TO DEAL WITH AN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS OF THE SCOPE OF THEIR AUTHORITY SHOULD BE WIDENED AS FAR AS NON COMPLIANCE IS CONCERNED I THINK IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT WIDER WOULD A DECLARED NON COMPLIANT A TOP CLASS NATIONAL ANTI DOPING ORGANISATION
ON THE GROUNDS OF ONE DISPUTED SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE CASE AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN THE A RATHER WILD FOR IT THE BRITISH TEAM SHOULD NOT GO TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES FOLLOWS AUTOMATICALLY BUT YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE STILL TOP CLASS IN SPITE OF THE QUESTION MARKS ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITY IN THIS CASE
I THINK THE INQUIRY THAT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INQUIRY THAT HE'S BEEN JUDGED BY YOU CARD SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE FIGHTS BEFORE WE REACH DECISIONS BUT THE DELIVERY OF SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO AN ATHLETE IF THAT IS WHAT THE NATIONAL ANTI DOPING ORGANISATION
HE'S ASKED TO DO AND WISHES TO DO OR NEEDS TO DO IT IS A BALANCED JUDGEMENT AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS AND HOW THAT JUDGEMENT AS RITA I DON'T I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT DECISION BEFORE WE TAKE ANY FURTHER STEPS SO CRAIG REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AND LLOYD MIGHT HAVE AS WELL
IT'S NOW COMING UP TO A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S GET A WEATHER FORECAST AND CHRIS FOXES HERE CHRIS AND SARAH GOOD MORNING WE'RE LOOKING AT A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY SHOWERS AFFECTING ENGLAND AND WALES THROUGH THE DAY WE'VE ALREADY GOT THOSE SHOWERS AFFECTING WALES AND SOUTH WEST ENGLAND A FEW PATCHES OF RAIN WORKING IN ACROSS EAST ANGLIA AND THE FAR NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND FOR A TIME THIS MORNING BUT HE'S INTO THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SHOWERS WILL BECOME REALLY HEAVY

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE FOURTH OF APRIL THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS LEAKED TO THE WORLD'S MEDIA HAVE SHOWN HOW SOME POLITICIANS AND THE SUPER RICH HAVE USED OFFSHORE COMPANIES TO DODGE TAX AND EVADE SANCTIONS
MIGRANTS DEPORTED FROM GREECE UNDER A CONTROVERSIAL YOU DEAL HAVE BEGUN ARRIVING IN TURKEY TAX OFFICIALS HAVE AGREED TO RELEASE FIGURES WHICH YEAR A SCEPTIC M.P.S BELIEVE WILL SHOW THAT THE SCALE OF E.U. MIGRATION TO THE U.K. HE'S BEEN SERIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED AND THE B. B. C.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A WORLD THAT UP TO NOW HAS BEEN REALLY SECRET I MEAN THAT'S THAT ONE PRODUCT THAT THE OFFSHORE WORLD SELLS AT SELL SECRECY AND WHERE YOU HAVE SECRECY YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR WRONG DOING WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED
WITH THIS PARTICULAR SET OF DOCUMENTS AS WE REALLY LOOKED FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS POLITICIANS PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICIANS AND WE FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM THIS WILL DEAL A REALLY BIG BLOW WE THINK TO THE OFFSHORE WORLD
THE PANAMANIAN LEEKS HAVE ALSO CREATED FURTHER DIFFICULTIES FOR FAITHER JUST SIX WEEKS AFTER ITS NEW PRESIDENT PLEDGED TO CLEAN UP THE ORGANISATION THE DOCUMENTS SUGGEST THAT A KEY MEMBER OF ITS ETHICS COMMITTEE THE URUGUAYAN LAWYER JUAN PEDRO DUMMY ARNIE HAS BUSINESS LINKS WITH EUGENIA FOR GARRIDO EMMA VEGETATE CORRUPT FOOTBALL OFFICIAL RICHARD CONWAY REPORTS

OFFICIALS HAVE AGREED TO PUBLISH A NEW FIGURE FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COME FROM THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO LIVE IN THE U.K. M.P.S HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE CURRENT FIGURE OF UNDER A MILLION SINCE TWENTY TEN IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE NUMBER OF NEW NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS ISSUED OVER THE SAME PERIOD YES OUT ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE PUBLICATION OF THESE FIGURES JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE E.U. REFERENDUM COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY INCENDIARY EFFECT ON THE CAMPAIGN AND PROVIDE A HUGE BOOST FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE IF AS EXPECTED THE FIGURES SHOWED THOSE SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS IN ORDER TO WORK
HE'S NEARLY DOUBLED THE NUMBER RECORDED IN THE OFFICIAL FIGURES PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS IT WILL INEVITABLY FUEL CLAIMS THAT THE TRUE LEVEL OF E.U. MIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERESTIMATED THE O. N. S. RECORDED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND E.U. MIGRANTS COMING TO THE U.K. LAST YEAR HOWEVER IT'S THOUGHT THE NUMBER SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS COULD BE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND
MINISTERS HAVE SOUGHT TO EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY ON THE GROUNDS MANY SEEKING NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS IN THE U.K. FOR SHORT TERM WORK A REPORT BY THE EDUCATION THINK TANK CENTRE FORUM HAS FOUND WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN DO LESS WELL IN THEIR GHQ THAN CHILDREN FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE

THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT ELEVEN MILLION DOCUMENTS FROM ONE LAW FIRM IN PANAMA THAT'S WHAT IT'S TAKEN FOR THE WORLD OF OFFSHORE FINANCE TO BE OPENED UP AS NEVER BEFORE AND FOR POLITICIANS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD TO BE EXPOSED AS PARTICIPANTS IN SCHEMES DESIGNED TO HIDE THEIR TAX AFFAIRS FROM THEIR VOTERS NOT ALWAYS ILLEGALLY
BUT IN A MANNER THAT WILL RAISE HUGE QUESTIONS FOR ALL THOSE ON THE LISTS WHICH ARE SAID TO CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FORTY POLITICIANS INCLUDING TWELVE NATIONAL LEADERS INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER OF ICELAND THE INFORMATION HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC BY A NUMBER OF PAPERS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE B.B.C. PANORAMA PROGRAMME IT'S BEEN COORDINATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST MARINA WALKER GUEVARA IS THEIR DEPUTY DIRECTOR
WELL DO YOU THINK IT COMES FROM AND IN THE SAUCES SAUCES OUR PROUD OUR WHERE ARE COLLEAGUES GERMAN NEWSPAPERS THE DEUTSCHES SATAN AND MORE THAN A YEAR AGO
AND THEY ARE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT YOU WOULD FIND HIM INTERESTING AND THEY ASK HOW HOW BIG IS THAT OUT AND THEY RESPONDED IS BIGGER THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN STUFF
AND THEY WERE RIGHT BECAUSE THESE THIS LEAK IS PROBABLY
THE BIGGEST LEAKING SHE STORY SATURDAY THERE'LL BE JUST A USHER LEAK
NICK OFF OUR INFORMATION HISTORY AND IT ALL COMES FROM ONE SOURCE
WE TRIED TO NOT DISCUSS YOUR AND I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY SENSI SENSITIVE AND WE DO OUR MAST TO PROTECT THOSE SOURCES WOULD NOT BANK TO SAY WHETHER THEY ARE WHY NOT GO ON TO ANY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED YOU THINK
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR POLITICIANS AROUND THE WORLD IN INGROWING INCLUDING HEADS OF A STATE
YEAH ASSOCIATES AND THEIR RELATIVES ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE SECRECY DAD PROVIDES AT THE ARCHER WORK RIGHT
PRIME MINISTERS WHO ARE PRESSING
OR CRAB STICK THESE PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF THE OSTER WERE OUT I HAD TO GIVE THEIR FINANCES UNDER WRAPS AND IN MANY CASES NOT THIS GLOW DOES COMPANIES
IN THEIR HAPPY DECORATIONS THE FACETS AND WHEN YOU SAY POLITICIANS DO YOU INCLUDE IN THAT DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME THAT A LOT OF DICTATORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED AROUND THE WORLD PROBABLY DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS WITH MONEY THAT POSSIBLY THEY SHOULDN'T DO BUT AMONG THOSE YOU ARE GOING TO REVEAL OUR POLITICIANS IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES
YEAH WELL YOU WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THEM A DEMOCRAT DEMOCRATIC ANDRIS I MEAN SOME CASES IN COUNTRIES
PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEY YOU KNOW WORKING FOR A TRANSPARENCY AND TO TRY TO PUT AN END TO OUR SHORE SO THAT'S THE IRONY OF IT HAVE THEY BROKEN THE LAW THESE PEOPLE
SOME OF THEM HAVE VIOLATED LOCO RULES ARE FOR EXAMPLE RULES THAT HAVE TO BE IN WITH THIS SCROLL
IN SOME CASES THOSE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MORE IMPORTANT I'VE TAPED BOOTY INCLUDING BRIBERY I SIGNING FOR EXAMPLE
I'LL SHED COMPANIES ARE USING OUR SHED COMPANIES TO HOLD CALLED MIND THE BRITISH CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER GEORGE OSBORNE HAS SAID QUITE RECENTLY ACTUALLY HE SAID IF YOU'RE EVADING TAX OFFSHORE THERE IS NO SAFE HAVEN AND WE WILL FIND YOU DOES IT LOOK FROM YOUR LIST AND FROM ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AS IF THESE PEOPLE WERE HAVING TO BE TERRIBLY SECRETIVE
THEY WERE TRYING TO BE VERY SECRETIVE AND THESE PEOPLE WE SEE A LOT OF USE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE SHARERS OUTWARDS YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE MORE SECRET I HAD TOOLS THAT THEY ARE SURETIES OFFERS BASICALLY AND THE PERSON WHO HOLDS THE SHARES US THE T.V. GOOD
HE'S THE OWNER I STILL SHARE A SANDAL SHARES REGISTER ANYWHERE WE HAVE SEEN THAT YOUR SECOND BERISHA HAVE SEEN MANY CASES SO THEY WERE YOU'VE SEEING AS MANY RESOURCES TOWARDS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE USHER WORLD
I'M LATE YOU'RE RINGING AND YOU DIFFERENT NOW JURISDICTIONS YOU USING FOUNDATIONS IN PANAMA WHICH WAS A THREAD VERY WIDELY TO THEIR CLIENT
SO YES I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT I IT BEGIN TENTING IN BEEN BEEN SECRETIVE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS PROBLEMS WITH US SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE USING IT FOR LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT THAT SECRECY OFFERED TO A WHOLE BUNCH
PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FOOD AND NOT YOUR SENIOR FOR THE RIGHT RESPONSE
MARINA WALKER GAVE OUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US WE'RE JOINED YOU SO MUCH BYE WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW BY ROBERT PALMER WHO'S HEAD OF THE GLOBAL WITNESS MONEY LAUNDERING CAMPAIGN AND BY LISA AS OFFSKI WHO WAS THE SECOND MOST SENIOR LAWYER IN THE F.B.I. SHE WAS ER DEBT WAS DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE F.B.I. GOOD MONITOR YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING ROBERT PALMER LET'S START WITH THAT POINT WHICH WE HEARD IN THE INTERVIEW THAT IN A SENSE ALMOST THE SURPRISING THING HERE IS HOW MANY SENIOR FIGURES FROM DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ARE IN THIS LIST
I MEAN I THINK WITH WHAT THIS LIST SHOWS IS IF YOU ARE RICH POWERFUL POLITICALLY CONNECTED YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A WHOLE OFFSHORE WORLD OF SECRECY WHERE YOU CAN HIDE YOUR ASSET HIDE YOUR IDENTITY
SOMETIMES THAT MAY BE LEGITIMATE BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S BEHIND THESE FILES WHAT'S BEHIND THIS INFORMATION AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF ABUSE SO NEXT MONTH THE U.K. PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON IS HOSTING AN ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT HERE IN LONDON HE'S SHOWN REAL LEADERSHIP ON TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON CORRUPTION MONEY LAUNDERING TAX EVASION
IF HE DOESN'T FORCE THE U.K. TAX HAVENS TO OPEN UP TO END THIS SORT OF ABUSE THAT'S GOING TO REALLY CALL INTO QUESTION WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO NOW YOU SAID THERE THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS WHY SOMEBODY WOULD WANT SECRECY WHAT AVE OR AT LEAST THERE ARE REASONS THAT MIGHT NOT BE ILLEGAL
UM YOU KNOW GLOBAL WITNESS WE THINK THE ABILITY TO HIDE YOUR IDENTITY BEHIND THESE COMPLICATED WEBS OF SHELL COMPANIES THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT IT YOU JUST SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED BECAUSE IT CONCEALS CRIMINALITY TAX EVASION CORRUPTION AND THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR HARMS ALL OF US IF WE DON'T GET THE TAXES IN WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES ARE THERE LUTHOR'S OSCAR CAN YOU THINK OF A LEGITIMATE REASON WHY SOMEBODY SHOULD BUGGERS PRIVACY IS ONE THING BUT A SECRECY
IS SOMETHING ELSE AT LEAST TO SECRECY THAT ALLOWS OTHERS TO HAT TIPPED TO BEHAVE CRIMINAL IT WAS SURE I MEAN YOU START UP COMPANY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ASSETS BASICALLY YOU REGISTER WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO REGISTER WHERE YOU WHAT DENT THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU'RE HIDING OR LET'S SAY YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST COVERED CELEBRITIES OR COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND YOU'RE GONNA GHANA ATTENTION NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO DO YOU WHY YOU ARE
CHILDREN'S ART LED TO YOUR FANCY SPORTS GUY YOU DON'T WANNA REGISTRY THAT YOU'RE OWNING A BIG HOUSE IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION WILL YOU FEEL IT MY SUBJECT HE WAS SOME SORT OF CRIME SO THERE ARE NUMBER OR YOUR APPLE AND YOU WANNA GET INTO A NEW TECHNOLOGY YOU WANNA VISIT TRADE SHOWS UNDETECTED
IS THERE A REASON TO HAVE A DIFFERENT COMPANY NAME OR A DIFFERENT REASON TO ESTABLISH A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DISCLOSE WHO YOU ARE OF COURSE THERE ARE AND I THINK THE POINT HERE IS THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT THEY WERE ILLEGITIMATE REASONS END IF YOU ARE
WORKING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE U.S. OR AS WE HEARD EARLIER THEY'RE NOW ALL THESE
BUDDIES COMING FORWARD SAYING WE WANNA SHARE WE'RE ARE GOING TO SHARE HERE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND THESE YOU'VE HEARD MANY OF YOUR PRIOR INTERVIEWS HAVE INDICATED THE GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IN GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WE ARE OF THESE
THE STRUCTURES ARE USED FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES FIRST AS WHEN THEY USE FOR A LEGITIMATE PURPOSES BECAUSE IF COUNTRIES SHARE THEN THERE CANNOT BE THE SECRECY THAT CAN HIDE WRONGDOING WELL I THINK THAT'S REALLY MEAN YOU LOOK AT WHERE IT WOULD JUST ABOUT MY COLLEAGUE IS HEADS MENTIONED SOME CONFERENCE IT'S COMING ON CORRUPTION THERE'S US THE FOURTH YOU MONEY LAUNDERING DIRECTIVE THAT ABOUT TO COME INTO PLACE IT'S GOING TO HAVE A REGISTRY A CENTRAL REGISTRY WHERE THERE'LL BE SOME EXCESS A BILL WITH THE LOCAL STANDS BEHIND SOME OF THESE
A STRUCTURES SO THERE WAS THERE IS MOVE AROUND THE WORLD OR AT LEAST
IN THEIR CASE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE TO GET THAT
WHO'S DOING WHAT TO HOME O.K. AND IN TERMS OF WHO'S DOING WHAT TO WHOM IT FORGIVEN YOUR OLD JOB THE F.B.I. NOW MUST LOOK AT THESE PAPERS I THINK WHERE DO WE START WELL IT'S A GREAT GREAT SOURCE OF INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY YOU GET A WHISTLE BLOWER PERHAPS YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE INSIDE WHO LEAKED INFORMATION WE THINK WE'RE NOT SURE WHO IT IS BUT WE'D LOVE TO KNOW BUT WHAT WE DO NOW IS WE GET AN INSIDER'S VIEW HERE THAT'S WHAT INVESTIGATORS THEY WANNA KNOW WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING IN THERE
GIVE ME A WINDOW INTO WHAT WAS GOING ON WE HAVE EMAIL TRAFFIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMIN OVER DOCUMENTS EMAILS COMMUNICATIONS CHAIR AT TEXTS EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER THAT MY DEVOLVED WE HAD THAT MONEY GIRL WHERE DID IT COME FROM WHERE DID IT GO
WHO SAID THEY WERE THE BENEFICIAL OWNER WHO ACTUALLY WAS THE BENEFICIAL OWNER AND YOU CAN DIG AND INTERVIEW PEOPLE TALK TO PEOPLE TRY TO SLIP UP TO GET TO THE SAUCE ROBERT PALMER WE HEARD EARLIER FROM LISA THE ARGUMENT FOR
PRIVACY EXTREME FORMS OF PRIVACY IS THERE STILL AN ARGUMENT FOR TAX HAVENS AT ALL NO I MEAN I DON'T THINK MY ORGANISATION GLOW WHEN IT'S DOESN'T THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HIDE YOUR IDENTITY BEHIND ANONYMOUS COMPANIES AND THEY SORT OF COMPLICATED WEBS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS OFFSHORE LEAK AND ACTUALLY DAVID CAMERON HAS BACKED THAT AS WELL SO FROM JUNE THIS YEAR ALL U.K. COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHO REALLY OWNS AND CONTROLS THEM
AND I THINK IF SOMETHING'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE U.K. AS WE'VE HEARD FOR EUROPE WE SHOULD START TO SEE THE TAX HAVENS TAKE A SIMILAR APPROACH THEY REALLY NEED TO OPEN UP THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS LEAKS FUELS CORRUPTION INFUSED INSTABILITY IF FUELS PEOPLE WHO ARE PREACHING SANCTIONS BUT THIS ALSO AS I SAID HURT EVERY DAY CITIZENS BECAUSE YOU AND I WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO AND PUT OUR MONEY IN AN OFFSHORE TAX HAVEN WE HAVE TO PAY OUR TAXES AND IF YOU HAVE RICH POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS GOING OFFSHORE
HIDING WHAT THEY'RE DOING I THINK THAT UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF OUR TAX SYSTEM AND OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM ROBERT PALMER LISETTE US OFFSKI THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
BUT I WAS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE HAVE A SPOILER ALERT ON THIS PROGRAMME BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY OF ROB AND HELEN IN THE ARCHERS BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN LAST NIGHT YOU WERE PLANNING TO HEAR THE REPEAT TODAY PLEASE TURN OFF THE RADIO NOW AT LEAST FOR A FEW MINUTES AND HERE IS HOW THE STORY HAS BUILT UP OVER THE LAST FOUR MONTHS DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAD BE WANTED IS QUITE HARROWING
I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU THERE ARE YOU REALLY SO BLIND TO YOURSELF DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE
ARE YOU SURPRISED HENRY WON'T HUG YOU YOU CAN'T EVEN GIVE HIM A BATH WITHOUT HURTING THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT IT'S ALWAYS AN ACCIDENT

IF YOU BECAME SO OVERWHELMED THAT YOU HURT ONE OF THE CHILDREN COULD IMAGINE NEVER DO I WOULDN'T YOU WOULDN'T INTEND TO
THE WAY HAPPY
SOMETIMES YOU FRIGHTEN ME
ONLY WANT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU
THAT MEANS IT DOWN
ONE THING HAS TO LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE
YOU SIT DOWN I'LL GO TO HIM
HUSBAND HE WAS MY HUSBAND ONCE AND EVERY DAY I WAS WITH HIM HE CHIPPED AWAY AT ME BIT BY BIT UNTIL THERE WAS NO JOY
ON CHIPPING WHAT I KNOW HOW YOU CAN LEAVE LOOK YOU SEE THIS IS NICE
TAKE IT COME ON PUT IT IN YOUR HAND
THERE WE ARE TWENTY FOUR MINUTES FAST EIGHT IS THE TIME NOW THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE YOU WILL HEAR WHAT THE DENOUEMENT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT CAKE CHISOLM AS THE RADIO CRITIC FOR THEIR SPECTATOR AND HE'S HERE AND
IT IT WORKS AS DRAMA DOESN'T IT FIRST PUT TO SO IT'S TOTALLY COMPELLING I MEAN I'VE NEVER LISTEN TO THE ARCHERS EVERY NIGHT BUT FOR THE LAST
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS I MEAN I I FOLLOWED IT ON MY MOBILE PHONE AND I'M AFRAID I DON'T NORMALLY DO THAT BUT IT'S LIKE CATCH UP HAS TO BE DONE I JUST HAVE TO MISS A THING AND IT'S IT'S
IT'S INSIDIOUS IT SORT OF CREEPS INSIDE YOU WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY THERE WITH IT I MEAN LAST NIGHT I WAS SHATTERED AND I WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED I WAS COOKING DINNER I HAD TO GO AND SIT DOWN THERE'S NO WAY I COULD CONTINUE
THEY'VE HAD LOTS OF DRAMA IN THE ARCHERS BEFORE BUT THEN NEVER ANYTHING AS SERIOUS AS THIS AND IN A SENSORS AS EVIL AS THIS WELL I THINK SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT TO ME I COS EVERY TIME I GO OUT I HAVE TO TALK TO MY FRIENDS WHAT'S CARRYING ON AND SOMEONE SAID TO ME THAT THAT IS THE FIRST TIME EVEN HAS ENTERED AMRIT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD BAD THINGS HAPPEN I MEAN SUSAN CARTER'S BROTHER WITH THAT CLASSIC CASE AND HE WAS KIND OF AND THAT AND THE HOSTAGE SITUATION IN THE POST OFFICE
THEY WERE THEY WERE HELD UP IN THE POST OFFICE ARMED ARMED ATTACKERS AND AND ALSO THERE WAS THERE WAS A SLIGHT SITUATION OF KIND OF SUSAN CARTER'S BROTHER WAS KIND OF HOVERING ROUND WOULD HE COME BACK WHAT DO YOU NOT COME BACK SO THERE'S THAT SENSE OF IMMINENT VIOLENCE WAS IN THAT STORY BUT IT WAS NEVER LIKE THIS NEVER AND WHEN
IN A SOAP OPERA DRAMA PEOPLE WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO SOMETHING TO AN ISSUE IT CAN BE DONE IN A PLODDING WAY
AND IT CAN BE DONE IN A CLEVER WAY THAT GENUINELY DOES DRAW ATTENTION TO THE UNDERLYING THING WHICH JUST COULD NOT BE MORE SERIOUS THAN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT FOR YOU HAS IT
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING I THINK TO BEGIN WITH NO I MEAN I JUST COULDN'T STAND ROBERT I JUST THOUGHT JUST LET'S GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS WE CAN AND THEN GRADUALLY YOU'VE GOT SUCKED INTO IT AND GRADUALLY YOU SAW
IT WAS BEING PLAYED OUT IT WAS PLAYED OUT VERY WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY SLOW IT WAS KIND OF IT JUST CREPT IN AND THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE WAY THAT HE RETURN FROM BEING REALLY HORRIBLE TO BEING REALLY NICE AND MARVELLOUS AND HOW HER HOW CONFUSED THAT MADE HELEN I THOUGHT I WAS VERY WELL DONE I THINK THE LAST FEW WEEKS IT SORT OF BEGAN WITH ROB'S MOTHER TURNED
AND CAME TO STAY AND SHE TURNED OUT TO BE WORSE THAN ROB AND YOU KIND OF THOUGHT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT REALLY WORKS LIKE THAT I MEAN I'M SURE THAT IN THE BACK STORY OF MANY OF THESE THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY COMES FROM SOMEWHERE BUT I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT MEN LAST NIGHT
I FELT IT WAS MELODRAMATIC AND YOU DIDN'T REALLY YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT VISUAL SENSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I THINK THAT WAS DELIBERATE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO THEY DIDN'T WANT US TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON COS I THINK THEY WANT US TO YET OBVIOUSLY WHAT THIS TO CARRY ON
BUT AS A RESULT YOU KIND OF LOST IT SLIGHTLY THAT'S HIM SEE OR ADVICE THEY'LL BE DIAL BACK ON THE MELODRAMA AND SPIN THIS OUT MORE BECAUSE IT'S THE SPINNING OUT THAT'S THAT'S THE PATH OH BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CAN I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE AND THEN HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO TRIAL
I MEAN HOW ARE WE GOING TO BEAR THAT I MEAN I I REALLY AM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING OR QUITE WHAT SOMETHING BACK YEAH I MEAN THERE WAS NO MORE THERE WAS NO MORE SOUND FROM ROB AFTER THE FIRST STABBING
THEN PRESUMABLY THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HOPE FOR ROB AND
AND FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN KEEP ON LISTENING BECAUSE BECAUSE ALSO ALSO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS HELEN HAS HAS BECOME THE ATTACKER
AND SO AND SO IN A WAY SHE'S YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FAIR IS IT SO ROB'S GOT UP GRUPS GOT OFF LIGHTLY BECAUSE I GOT LISTEN THOUGH
I'M SERIOUSLY I'M NOT SURE I'VE STOPPED LISTENING TO THE ARCHERS BEFORE REALLY OH YES OH YES IT COMES AND GOES I'VE NEVER BEEN QUITE SO HELD BY IT BUT I HAD BUT I'M A BIT HANG ON IF YOU STOP LISTENING COS YOU ARE BORED US TIME IT'S LOOKING BECAUSE HE COULDN'T STAND THE SUSPENSE I'M NOT NEVER BUY A SUSPENSE I COULDN'T STAND THE QUARRELLING AND THE FACT THAT IT BECAME QUITE SORT OF DAVID AND RUTH AT ONE POINT WERE QUARRELLING ALL THE TIME
IT'S GOT FED UP WITH IT I JUST COULDN'T STAND THAT COS YOU WANT IT TO BE CALM YOU WANTED TO BE REASSURING YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO I MEAN EVERY NIGHT YOU'RE KIND OF ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND FASCINATING AS A GER LOOKING BACK AT YOUR RADIO CRITIC LOOKING AT THE DRAMA SIDE OF IT BUT SOCIAL MEDIA NOW CAN REINFORCE ALL OF THIS IN A WAY THAT IT COULDN'T HAVE DONE A FEW YEARS
AND I WONDER IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE DOING I WAS PLAYING TO THE AUDIENCE AND HER REACTING AND RESPONDING TO THE AUDIENCE IN A WAY THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE BEFORE THEY WOULD HAD A VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHERE THEY WANTED THE STORY TO GO ONE CAN'T HELP FEELING THAT THEY'RE NOW MANIPULATING THE AUDIENCE CAUGHT MANIPULATING STORYLINE ACCORDING TO HOW THE AUDIENCE RESPONDS AND WHICH IN A WAY IS A BIT LIKE WHAT THEY DID WITH CEREAL
AND I WONDER IF THAT'S WHAT ONE FEELS IS IS NOW IN THE LAST IS IS HOW GENUINE IS THIS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU FELT IT WAS VERY COMPELLING AND VERY TRUE I'M NOT SURE
YOU WONDER WHAT THE AGRICULTURAL SCRIPT EDITOR MAKES OF IT ALL WELL YES O.K. CHISHOLM FROM THE SPECTATOR PACKS OH KAY RATS AND WE SHOULD JUST SAY I'M IN THERE WAS AN OVERWHELMING RESPONSE ONLINE LAST NIGHT TO IT AND STILL GOING ON NOW AND IT'S OF COURSE JUST PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THOSE A HELPLINE IF YOU ARE THEN AFFECTED BY IT
OH EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT OH NINE IF YOU'RE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PERHAPS WANT TO SPEAK TO SOMEBODY OH EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT THEY DATE EIGHT EIGHT
ROB WITH THE SPORT YOU THOUGHT THE ARCHES WERE DRAMATIC WHAT ABOUT THE CRICKET IN KOLKATA WE'LL START WITH THE SOUND OF THE WEST INDIAN TEAM RETURNING TO THEIR HOTEL AFTER THAT STUNNING FOR WICKET FINAL OVER FOUR TIMES SIX HIT VICTORY IN THE WORLD TO TWENTY FINAL AGAINST ENGLAND HERE NOW THE SOUNDS THAT ACCOMPANIED THEIR RETURN TO THE TEAM HOTEL
NO QUESTION THEY PARTED LONG INTO THE NIGHT BUT WEST INDIAN CRICKET HAS BEEN THROUGH TURBULENT TIMES WITH UNDER ACHIEVEMENT IN THE TEST MATCH FORMAT ESPECIALLY UNDERPINNED BY DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PLAYERS AND THEIR BOREDOM THAT'S WHY MATCH WINNER CARLOS BRAITHWAITE HAD THIS TO SAY

IN THE COURT OF TODAY YOU FIND VERY FEW INDIVIDUALS GOING TO CRICKET

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR SIR MONTAGUE AND JUSTIN WEBB THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE AND CHARLES CAROL'S HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS MILLIONS OF LEEKS CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS FROM A PANAMANIAN LAW FIRM HERVE EXPOSED HOW SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE INCLUDING POLITICAL LEADERS EVADE TAX LAUNDER MONEY AND DODGE SANCTIONS THE COMPANY MOSS SEC VON SECKER INSISTS ITS ACTIVITIES ARE LEGITIMATE
THE FIRST BOATS DEPORTING MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY UNDER A CONTROVERSIAL Y. YOU DEAL HAVE ARRIVED AT THE TURKISH PORT OF DICKY V. AND HAVE THE DEAL OF MIGRANTS WHO HAVEN'T APPLIED FOR ASYLUM OR WHO'VE HAD THEIR CLAIMS REJECTED ARE BEING SENT BACK OFFICIALS HAVE AGREED TO PUBLISH NEW FIGURES FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO WORK IN THE U.K. FROM THE REST OF THE E.U. IN PEAS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE CURRENT FIGURE IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE NUMBER OF NEW NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS ISSUED
WHITE BRITISH CHILDREN DO LESS WELL IN THEIR G.C.S.E.S THAN CHILDREN WHERE ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE ACCORDING TO THE THINK TANK CENTRE FORUM IT FOUND THAT BY THE TIME THEY REACH SIXTEEN THEY HAVE SLIPPED BELOW TEN OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF UNITE THE G. AND B. AND COMMUNITY UNIONS WILL BE MEETING IN LONDON LATER TO DISCUSS HOW TO SAVE THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY TATA STEEL ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THAT IT WAS SELLING ITS LOSS MAKING U.K. BUSINESSES

REFERENDUM HOW MANY NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN RECENT YEARS TO MIGRANTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION COMES AT THE END OF QUITE A FIGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO PUBLISH THE FIGURES THEY WERE ORIGINALLY REQUESTED BY JONATHAN PORTERS SENIOR FELLOW AT THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL FORMER GOVERNMENT ADVISER ECONOMIC ADVISER HIMSELF AND IS ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LEARN
WELL WE ALREADY KNOW HOW MANY NATIONAL INSURANCE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO EUROPEAN MIGRANTS ABOUT TWO MILLION OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE STILL IN THE COUNTRY IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T KNOW THE SCALE OF NET MIGRATION TO THE U.K.
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN SOME FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT HAVEN'T TOLD US WHAT YET IS HOW MANY OF THOSE NUMBERS WERE STILL ACTIVE BY ACTIVE I MEAN I THEY CLAIMING BENEFITS OR MORE LIKELY THEY PAYING TAX PERHAPS PAY I PAY AS YOU EARN OR NATIONAL INSURANCE OR TAX OR SELF EMPLOYED PEOPLE SO IF THEY'RE ACTIVE THEY ARE STILL HERE THE LIKELY TO BE STILL HERE THAT'S FOR THAT THAT'S RIGHT IT'S QUITE AN IMPORTANT POINT ISN'T IT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CRITICS OF THESE NUMBERS SAY WHAT YOU DO YOU LEARN NOTHING BECAUSE NASH INSURANCE
CARDS ARE ISSUED AND THEN THE PERSON MIGHT BE DOING TEMPORARY WHERE MIGHT GET HOME AGAIN AND THE CARD IS FOR LIFE AND IT DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT WHO IS ACTUALLY HERE YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING IT MIGHT TELL YOU A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT WELL THAT'S RIGHT THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED NUMBERS AT THE GOVERNMENT REGULARLY PUBLISHED TELLS US HOW MANY PEOPLE ARRIVE AND REGISTER THEY DON'T TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL HERE ONE YEAR TWO YEAR THREE YEAR FOUR YEARS ON WHICH OF COURSE FOR THE POINT OF VIEW OF MEASURING NET IMMIGRATION
MEASURING BOTH THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY AND IN THE FORM OF TAX AND JOBS AND WHAT IT COST US IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN PRESSURE ON POPULATION SO ON THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING AND NO WE DON'T KNOW THAT FROM THESE FIGURES BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S COMPUTER SYSTEMS CAN TELL US AND IT'S THAT INFORMATION BUT SO FAR THEY'VE BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO RELEASE TO TODAY WHAT WHAT HIM HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON THE DEBATE
WELL I HOPE IT WILL RAISE THE LEVEL OF THE BAIT BUT BECAUSE THE MOMENT WE'VE BEEN SLIGHTLY GROPING IN THE DARK AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING OH YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE HERE THAN WE THINK THAT MIGHT BE TRUE
BUT IT MIGHT NOT EQUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER MADE SOME RATHER DUBIOUS CLAIMS OF THE PROPORTION OF OF OF PEOPLE WHO COME HERE HAVE CLAIM BENEFIT THESE FIGURES MIGHT TELL US WHETHER THOSE CLAIMS WERE IN FACT THROUGH OR NOT SO I HOPE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IT WILL GO ON LINFORD I DO HELP IT WILL GIVE US BETTER INFORMATION HELP US TO BETTER INFORMED OPEN HAVE YOU COS YOU'RE A CAMPAIGNER FOR US TO STAY IN THE I'M NOT A CAMP YOU'RE NOT A CARROT HENNA BUT YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES IN IN
IMMIGRATION FROM THE EUROPEAN YOU DID FROM ELSEWHERE AND YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT SOMEONE CERTAINLY IS CAMPAIGNING TO LEAVE THERE IS A RISK THAT THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE LEADS TO A BIG FELLA FATHER LEAVE CAMPAIGN JUST BEFORE THE VOTE AND WELL I CERTAINLY TAKE THE VIEW BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND THE ECONOMICS THAT EUROPEAN MIGRATION AND MIGRATION IN GENERAL HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE U.K. ECONOMY BUT MY JOB HERE
WHAT THEY ARE PAYING ME FOR IS TO PROVIDE OBJECTIVE INFORMED ANALYSIS TO INFORM THE BRITISH PEOPLE SO THEY CAN DECIDE WHICH WAY TO DON'T TAKE A VIEW ON THAT SO IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THAT SORT OF ANALYSIS I AND OTHERS NEED THESE FIGURES ON THE POT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO NINE
THAT WAS THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS THIS MORNING SMALL GROUP OF PROTESTERS OUTSIDE THE PORT CHANTING WHEN THE MIGRANT BOATS SET SAIL TO HAVE THEM SO FAR VOLUNTEER RESCUERS ABOARD A NEARBY BOAT HOISTING A BANNER THAT READ FERRETS FOR SAFE PASSAGE NOT FOR DEPORTATION BUT STILL DEPORTATIONS WENT AHEAD TO BOATLOADS OF MIGRANTS SENT BACK
TO TURKEY THE BEGINNING OF COURSE OF A SCHEME THAT'S BEEN ARRANGED BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY AND THE IDEA IN THE END IS THAT QUITE A FEW MORE GO INDEED THE IDEA EVEN THIS WEEK IS THAT HUNDREDS OR ON THOSE BOATS WILL IT WORK AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MIGRANTS IF AS SOME HAS BEING SAYING THEY WELL THEY REFUSED TO LEAVE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE GREEK GOVERNMENT'S MIGRATION SPOKESMAN GEORGIA SCRITTI SIS OH
WE DON'T KNOW WE BETTER REGISTRATION AND FACILITIES DO YOU HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT TO REMEMBER A TRACTOR BUT WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING WOULD BE MORE EVENT BY THE BOOK BUT YOU'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL BE SO IF THEY WON BUT YOU ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE NOT TO GO ON
BUGGER PREPARE IF YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK OF A PLANT
DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A VIOLENT RESPONSE FROM SOME OF THE MIGRANTS THAT THEY JUST WILL REFUSED TO CO OPERATE AND IF THEY DO WHAT WILL YOU WHAT YOUR PEOPLE DO NO I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE A VIOLENT RESPONSE BECAUSE NO GOOD TO BE BOROUGH TURKEY A POO POO UP BEFORE I WENT TO A PLACE WHAT A SHAME SO THEY KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TERRITORY
VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR A LOT BUT WILL THEY FORCIBLY BE PUT ON BOATS HERE THEY WOULD BE PUT ON WALL BUT THEY DON'T WEIGH BUT THE RISK IS I SUPPOSE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SO DESPERATE THAT THERE IS NO HUMANE WAY OF PUTTING THEM ON THE BOAT SHORT OF ACTUALLY MARCHING THEM ON AND I JUST WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK FROM A GREEK PERSPECTIVE WHETHER THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE
IF YOU DON'T EAT YOU TURKEY WENT AND BITTER ALWYN POOP AND BUCK UP OR PERKY
BUT IT WAS FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAVE SAID THAT THE NEED TO BE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND STAFF TO DO THIS JOB IS IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE THAT NUMBER AT THE MOMENT
NOT A LOT MORE EXPERT OR THEIR PREPARE AT ALL WOULDN'T DEAL WITH IT O.K. LOOK OBLIGATIONS THERE ARE FEW CLEVER BE PROBABLY POOP ON THE RED HERE PLEASE FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
GRANITA U.N.H.C.R. HAS SAID IN LINE WITH OUR POLICY ON OPPOSING MANDATORY DETENTION WE'VE SUSPENDED SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES AT THE CLOSED CENTRES THESE ARE THE CENTRES WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD BEFORE THEY'RE SENT
WE WERE MORE SHORTLY WHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE THOUGH THAT THEY'VE SUSPENDED THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE
WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF MONEY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS BEEN HELPING HASN'T IT FINANCIALLY DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY THAT YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO DO THIS JOB THAT STARTS TODAY NO WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM THAT MIGHT BE LOCATED WHERE BEAUTY RIGHT
BUT VERY CONDITION EARLY PIECES AND ONE OF THESE BONES BUT ADDICTED WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BUT IF PREY IS SHOULD BE QUICKLY SUPPORTED AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF IT IS IT'LL BE A BIT OCRACY OR BUMP AGAINST BOTH WITH THE WHO
IT SOUNDS TO ME AS AS IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GREECE AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON THE DAY THAT THIS PROCESS THIS VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS IS MEANT TO START IS WELL I MEAN A BIT OF A MESS REALLY
HERE IT SAYS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ABOUT THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO NINE HOW D.J.S DECIDE WHAT MUSIC TO PLAY NEW HEAD OF MUSIC AT RADIO ONE CHRISTOPHER PRICE'S TOLD STAFF TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT MUSIC USING YOUR EARS RATHER THAN DATA SERVED UP BY THIRD PARTY SOURCES THEY SORT HIS BIG STREAMING SERVICES LIKE SPOTIFY YOUTUBE
WELL WE'RE JOINED IN A RADIO CAR BY STEVE UM ACHETER B.B.C. RADIO SIX MUSIC D.J. AND BY THE BY THE JOURNALIST EAMON FORD WHO FREELANCE WRITER ON MUSIC AMONG OTHER THINGS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH STEVE THEM OUT HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
I DO I GO BY THE OLD JOHN PEEL ROLE REALLY THAT YOU PLAY SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU HOPE THEY LIKE AND SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE HIM WHO KNOWS WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT LIKE IT OR NOT SO IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEM MIGHT I TAKE A PILE OF C.D.S AND LISTEN TO THEM AND SOME LYNX I'VE BEEN SENT AND YOU JUST TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD RADIO PROGRAMME FROM THOSE PARTICULAR TRACKS YOU CAN SEND HER LITERALLY A PILE OF C.D.S THAT SOUNDS VERY OLD FASHIONED THAT PHRASE
I KNOW IT'S US DOESN'T IT BUT YOU STILL GET A SACK FULL OF ACTUAL MILE SACK FULL OF SEA DAYS A WEEK AND THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN'T GO ON TO ENTER YOU HAVE TO STILL DO IN REAL TIME IT'S JUST SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO THEM AND SAY YOU GENERALLY SEE IF THEY ARE ANY GOOD AND IF THEY ARE YOU THINK THIS SOUNDS REASONABLE HE FIND A NEW BAND THAT YOU THINK ARE QUITE GOOD AND GO AND SEE THEM GO AND SEE THEM LIVE AND FROM THERE YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WHETHER ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL AT LIES AHEAD
AND AIMING FOR THAT'S RELATIVELY UNUSUAL NOW THOUGH ISN'T IT BECAUSE SO MANY PLAYLISTS ARE PUT TOGETHER JUDGING BY WHAT PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO ME IT'S A COMBINATION OF WHAT THEY CALL MACHINE LEARNIN HUMAN CURATION SO THEY'LL BE LOOKIN AT LEAST WHAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THE MATCH IN WITH WHAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO SO IT'S SIMILAR LIKE ONLINE RETAILERS LIKE AMAZON THEY'LL PUT THEIR PUT FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS IT IT'S KIND OF THAT
WISDOM OF THE CROWD'S APPROACH BUT IF YOU RELY ENTIRELY ON THAT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY PERHAPS MAYBE FIVE YEARS AGO KIND OF LOST ITS MIND A LITTLE BIT OF JUST WENT IT'S ALL ABOUT LET'S JUST LOOK AT YOU TWO PLAYS AND PLAYS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THAT YOU'RE ON A HIDING TO NOTHING BUT I THINK TO DISMISSED ALL OF THAT INFORMATION YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LISTENERS YOU'VE SUDDENLY GOT THIS INCREDIBLE POOL OF DEAL THAT CAN HELP TO SHAPE
BUT SHOULDN'T ENTIRELY DIRECT YOUR DECISIONS OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO GOOD MUSIC DEALER COME IT'S LIKE A HANDRAIL IT'S NOT THE WALK WIFE O.K. SO IT'S SO CHRISTOPHER PRICE'S COMMENTS YOU WHAT WELCOME BUT SAY DON'T THROW OUT SOME OF THAT DAY WHEN HE'S HE'S COME FROM THAT BACKGROUND HE'S COME FROM A DIGITAL BACKGROUND HE'S WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT PLAYLIST ON ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM SO HE'S NOT HE'S NOT A LOT OUT IN THAT SAME SPOT I THINK HE'S VERY MUCH
A WIRE OFF THE MISTAKES THAT THE RECORD INDUSTRY HAS MADE IN RECENT YEARS BY THIS OVER RELIANCE ON B. I THINK ALONE IS A BAD STRATEGY BUT ALSO PERHAPS THE RELYING ON YOUR EARS ALONE IS ALSO ABOUT STRATEGY THIS STEPHEN OUT HAVE YOU NEVER LISTEN TO HAD SOMETHING ON SPOTIFY THERE PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE AND THOUGHT WOW THAT SOUNDS GREAT
NO I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE BUT NOTHING BUT NO I DO I NEVER IT'S OF FOR ME ON AREN'T VERY MUCH AT THE START I SUPPOSE IN THE LINK THIS PROCESS OF PROMOTING MUSIC WHAT CHRIS IS DOING I THINK HE'S EMPHASISING WHERE RADIO ONE WHAT THEIR JOB IS RADIO ONE BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY THE HITS AND THAT'S FINE AND YOU CAN TAKE CERTAIN
INFORMATION FROM THE STREAMING SERVICES BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT'S PART OF RADIO ONE'S JOB REALLY WHEN RADIO ONE IS GOOD IS TO TAKE NEW BANDS NURTURE NEW TALENT AND THEN PLAY THEM OMITS THE HITS AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW YOU'LL GET THE NEXT WAVE OF ARTISTS AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE NEW OFFICE RIGHT AT THE VERY START WON'T BE APPEARING ON SPOTTY FINALIST WON'T HAVE THE NUMBER ON YOU CHEAP HITS THAT THE BIGGER ARTIST HE MAKES THE POINT IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH FINANCIAL TIMES IF IT WAS LEFT TO COMMERCIAL RADIO TO BREAK NEW MUSIC WOULD BE IN ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE
AND THAT'S CLEARLY RIGHT FROM THE NUMBERS ISN'T IT EAMONN HOLMES EAMONN FORD EAMONN HOLMES THAT'S HER SORRY I'VE BEEN CALLED MANY TERRIBLE THINGS MY LIFE BUT THEY SAY THE WORST OH THAT'S NOT FAIR WHAT APOLOGIES FORGETTING GETTING YOUR NAME WRONG YEAH THAT'S YOU OBVIOUSLY WERE IN B. B. C. SO THERE THERE'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF FLIGHT WE EVEN FOR THE B. B. C. STATIONS BUT COMMERCIAL RADIO IS STILL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN MAKING THE MAGA HITS ONES OBVIOUSLY
THEY THEY PLAY FEWER TRIAX THE PLAY THEM I'M HEAVIER ROTATION BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET TO THE LEVEL OF A HORROR BEYOND SAY OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT COMMERCIAL RADIO WAS ABSOLUTELY KEY TO THAT BECAUSE THEY THEY REACH AN AUDIENCE THAT PERHAPS AREN'T SO INTEREST IN THE MINUTIAE OF THE NEW
BUT ISN'T THERE SOMETHING CLEVER THAT SOME OF THE DATA CAN DO WHICH IS AND WHETHER IT'S SPOTIFY OR ANOTHER SOME OTHER STREAMING SERVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PERHAPS GET SOMETHING AS BEING LISTENED TO IN ONE PART WITH SOMETHING SUDDENLY GOES VIRAL IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD AND YOU CAN PICK UP ON IT ELSEWHERE THEY'VE GOT INCREDIBLE LAYERS OF PEAT WAS SO THEY'VE GOT IT YEARS OF LISTENIN HISTORIES OF YOU'VE BEEN USERS BUT FIVE YEARS THEY CONTRITE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO THAT I A COMPANY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO CALLED THE ECHO
WHICH CAR BREAKS DOWN INTO ITS COMPONENT PARTS AND THOUGH THE OVERLAY AND ALL OF THESE THINGS PREVIOUSLY EARNED MUSICAL LOGICAL ANALYSIS AND ALSO THEY'VE GOT ACTUAL CAREER IT IN THERE AND THERE THEY PUT HUMANS ON TOP OF THAT SO IT'S BELT AND BRACES O.K. BUT STEVIE WOULD SAY SEND US TO KEEP SENDING YOU THEIR C.D.S
YEAH ABSOLUTELY IT'S ALL COME TO COME DOWN I THINK THIS CHANGE AT RADIO ONE WILL COME DOWN TO WHETHER THEY HAVE GOT THE YEARS NOW THAT'S THE THING SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE THAT'S VERY BOLD MOVE I THINK BUT YOU CARRY ON SENDING THE RECORD YOU WANT TO HAVE THEIR FINGER ON THE PULSE LET'S HOPE THEY'VE GOT THEIR EARS IT'S THEIR JOB TO STEVE IMMAC EAMONN FORD THANK YOU BOTH IT'S LIKE THE TIME IS TEN TONIGHT
AND THE DAME JUDI DENCH MADE HISTORY AT THE OLIVIER AWARDS LAST NIGHT BY WINNING MORE TIMES THAN ANY OTHER PERFORMER SHE PICKED UP HER EIGHTH THE BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS AWARD FOR HER ROLE IN THE WINTER'S TALE BEST ACTRESS WAS TAKEN BY DENISE GOUGH WHO STARRING IN
PEOPLE PLACES AND THINGS SHE MADE THE POINT WHEN ACCEPTING THE AWARD THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH DIVERSITY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SAID HAD OTHER AWARD CEREMONIES THAT ALL ACTRESSES NOMINATED IN HER CATEGORY WERE WHITE
THE NOMINATIONS DON'T REFLECT WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON STAGE IS THIS YEAR
MIKE AND TROUBLE FOR SAYING THAT BUT I I THINK THAT THERE ARE I THINK NOMA AS WHO DID THAT FANTASTIC TROJAN PERFORMANCE IN LINDA THIS YEAR FOR IT TO GO ON RECOGNISE I THINK IT'S A BIT OF A SHAME
I THINK IT'S A HUGE SHAME IT'S NOT A BIT OF A SHAME I THINK WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON STAGES BUT I THINK THINGS LIKE THIS NEED TO START REFLECTING IT TODAY'S GOTH LAST NIGHT WELL OF THE PLAY PEOPLE PLACES AND THINGS WON TWO AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED IN FOUR CATEGORIES SO WHY HAS IT BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WE'RE JOINED BY THE MAN WHO WROTE IT DUNCAN MCMILLAN CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU HI WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT THE PLAY AND THE WAY YOU'VE TREATED WHAT IS SUCH A SERIOUS SUBJECT AND HIS ADDICTION AND IT'S ABOUT REHAB
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT THAT SORT OF GETS TO PEOPLE DO YOU THINK I THINK A HUGELY IT'S DENISE'S PERFORMANCE IT'S A HUGE HUGE HUGE PERFORMANCE YOU'RE RIGHT THESE PLAYS WELL I I WROTE THIS PLAY KNOWING THAT THERE'S SO MANY WOMEN OF MY GENERATION ACTRESSES OF MY GENERATION WHO JUST AREN'T NECESSARILY GETTING THE PARTS AREN'T GETTING STRETCH IN THE WAY THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY REALLY CAN BE
AND BUT I DIDN'T QUITE ACCOUNT FOR THIS EXTRAORDINARY TRUST COMING ALONG AND AND DOING ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES I'VE EVER SEEN AND I'M VERY FORTUNATE IT'S HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLAY THAT I'VE WRITTEN THAT AND THAT CERTAINLY WILL WE LIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THE WEST END IS FOR I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT EATS UP IS THESE THESE HUGE BARNSTORMING CENTRAL PERFORMANCES AND I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A HUGE PART OF IT IT'S ALSO I THINK
WHEE WHEE WHEE THERE'S VERY FEW PLACES INCREASINGLY FEW PLACES IT FEELS TO GET TO DEAL WITH IT COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE AND DEAL WITH THAT WITH HER SHE'S OF COMPLEXITY AND SO THE IDEA THAT THE PRIMARY IDEA IN TERMS OF WHAT IT ADDRESSES ABOUT ADDICTION
I HAVE A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT HOW ADDICTION IS TREATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE WEST IN GENERAL AND AND AND I I FEEL LIKE THIS THE TWELVE STEP PROCESS IN PARTICULAR HAS SAVED LIVES OF PEOPLE I KNOW AND YET IT'S I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS OF IT SO I THOUGHT THOSE THOSE ISSUES WERE WORTH SCRUTINISING AND DRAMATISING SOMEHOW BIG AND YOU
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW FROM HER POINT OF VIEW OF MATING AND EMPATHY FROM THE AUDIENCE'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THEY CAN PERHAPS UNDERSTAND OR GO WITH IT RATHER THAN THINK IT'S OTHER IT'S SEPARATE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEATRES FOR I THINK WE GO THERE WERE THE IMPULSE TO WRITE IS THE SAME IMPULSE I HAVE TO AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER I GO TO
TRY AND IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES AND SOMEONE ELSE'S MIND AND HAVE HAD SOME EMPATHY HAVE SOME CONNECTION WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS STRUGGLES OTHER THAN MY OWN I THINK THAT FEELS ARE SORELY LACKING AT THE MOMENT IF YOU LOOK AROUND WHAT'S HAPPENING THE WORLD AND SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN OUR NAME WE COULD ALL DO WITH TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
STRUGGLING IN ADVERSITY AND REALLY NEEDING HELP AND AND EMPATHISE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S WE WE TEND TO FILTER INCREASINGLY FILTER WHO WILL LISTEN TO WHO WE ARE WHO WE RESPECT WHAT NEW SOURCES WE GO TO I THINK WE THINK WE'RE THAT WE'RE MORE CONNECTED WE HAVE MORE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND WE WE ARE MORE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING AND ACTUALLY MAYBE WE'RE JUST FILTERING AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE ISOLATED INTO OUR LITTLE TRIBES AND SO
YEAH IT'S NICE TO BRING A BIG GROUP OF DIVERSE STRANGERS TOGETHER AND GUIDE THEM THROUGH A FOLLOWING FOLLOWING A PROTAGONIST THAT'S ADDICTS OFTEN IN OTHER DRAMAS OFTEN PUNCHLINES OR THEY DIE OR A SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER ONE SOMEBODY CAN YOU CAN RELATE I HOPE SO YEAH DUNCAN MCMILLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME NOW FIVE TO NINE AROUND THE WORLD IN TIME ZONE AFTER TIME ZONE NERVOUS FLUNKIES ARE TELLING NATIONAL LEADERS THAT THEIR TAX AFFAIRS ARE IN THE PUBLIC EYE TIS AN EXTRAORDINARY LEAK INFORMATION WE'VE SEEN THIS MORNING THE BIGGEST EVER IT IS CLAIMED EVEN BIGGER THEM WIKILEAKS ELEVEN MILLION DOCUMENTS FOR ONE LAW FIRM IN PANAMA AS NOT JUST THE USUAL DICTATORS AND THUGS ON THE LIST OF THOSE WHO SHOUT AT THEIR TAX AFFAIRS IN OFFSHORE COMPANIES DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS
AS WELL RICHARD MURPHY IS PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY AT CITY UNIVERSITY LONDON ATTACKS CAMPAIGNER HE'S IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO MICHA GLENYS HERE AUTHOR OF MAC MAFIA SERIOUSLY ORGANISED CRIME MORNING TO YOU BOTH AND FIRST OF ALL RICHARD MURPHY DO YOU THINK THIS LEAK WILL HAVE A REAL IMPACT
YES I DO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THE FIRST IS QUITE CLEARLY THAT IT CONFIRMED IN A SENSE WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH INFLUENCE OUR ACTING CORRUPTLY AND IN THE PROCESS THEY'RE UNDERMINING OUR DEMOCRACY THAT UNDERMINING OUR TRADING SYSTEMS THEY'RE UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW PERNICIOUS THIS SYSTEM IS AND SECONDLY IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THERE ARE ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS AND BANKERS WHO ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM
THIRDLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS IT'S HAPPENING ON OUR PATCH THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS ISSUES BRITISH PASSPORTS HAS THE QUEEN ON IT STAMP WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS TAX EVASION IS A FOREIGN AFFAIRS ISSUE AND WE ARE NOT STOPPING IT SO THIS IS VITAL FOR BRITISH POLICY FOR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND FOR CLEANING UP THE PUBLIC ACT I MISTER GLENYS PEOPLE THE LEVEL OF SECRET
THAT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS PLACE THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE I MEAN I WAS FIRST ALERTED TO THIS IN DETAIL WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK MY MAFIA TEN YEARS AGO
AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT BECAUSE THE LEVELS OF SECRECY WAS SO TIGHT IT'S NOT ONLY CORPORATIONS AND SO ON WHO ARE USING THIS THESE FACILITIES IN ORDER TO EVADE TAX IT'S CRIMINALS AS WELL YOU HAVE HUGE MONEY LAUNDERING GOING ON THROUGH THESE TAX HAVENS AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY THERE WASN'T THEN THERE ISN'T ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR ALLOWING THESE PLACES TO OPERATE IN THE WAY THEY DO
WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING MCMURPHY I DISCOVERED THAT THE SECOND LARGEST INVESTOR IN MAINLAND CHINA WAS THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS NOW WHY WAS THAT I HAVE HIM DISCOVERED IT'S BECAUSE ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE WERE INVESTING IN CHINA THAT THEY DIDN'T BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT THE AUTHORITIES IN BEIJING TO NO LETTER ONE LET ALONE ANYONE IT IS THAT IN A SENSE NOW THEY ANSWERED AT THIS RICHARD MURPHY THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS SUCH A REPUTATION A RISK IN THE FUTURE AT LEAST OF BEING INVOLVED IN THESE THINGS BECAUSE AT THE OTHER SHADY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED THERE THAT THAT THAT IS
THE PATH TOWARDS GETTING I JUST POLITICIANS OTHER INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE OUT OF THEM I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHEN JOHN CHRISTENSEN OF THE TAX JUSTICE NETWORK AND I STARTED THAT ORGANISATION IN TWO THOUSAND TO TO CHALLENGE TAX HAVENS THE FIRST TIME THAT IT EVER HAPPENED WE DECIDED WE WOULD PUT
COMPANIES INDIVIDUALS ON THE FRONT PAGES OF NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE THEIR REPUTATION OR RISK OF USING THESE PLACES SO HIGH THAT WE WOULD PUT THEM OFF NOW WE SUCCEEDED TO SOME DEGREE THIS IS ANOTHER STEP IN THAT PROCESS WHAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO IS EMBARRASS THOSE LARGE FIRMS OF ACCOUNTANTS THOSE HIGH STREET BANKS WHO ARE STILL IN THESE PLACES AND YOU WILL FIND VERY FAMILIAR NAME
IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS THOSE FIRMS NOW HAVE TO BE EMBARRASSED TO PULL OUT OR HAVE THEIR LICENCE US REVIEW TO OPERATE IN THE U.K. BECAUSE OF THEIR LINKS WITH THESE PLACES THEY MAY DO NOTHING ILLEGAL BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ENDORSE THE LIBERTY OF THESE PLACES WHICH ARE VENUES FOR CRIMINAL ACTUALLY KEEP SANE PEOPLE NOT DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL MICHIGAN AND I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE AND SOME OF THESE THESE THESE INDIVIDUAL
BUT AND INDEED THE LAW FIRM SAYS HE'S DONE NOTHING ILLEGAL THE LAW FIRM NAMED THIS MORNING
WHY I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A COMPANY BASED
IN PANAMA OR FEWER JUST A PERFECTLY NORMAL UPSTANDING PERSON WHAT DO YOU DO IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND I NOTICED WHEN THE PANAMA LEAGUES DOCUMENT WITH THE I.C.A. JAY HAVE PUBLISHED THEY SAID OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE REASONS FALLEN TO MAKE USE OF THESE HAVE THESE HAVENS WHAT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THOSE LEGITIMATE REASON FAR YOU'RE HIDING THINGS THERE LOOK BEHIND THIS JUST IN THAT'S A GOOD NEWS STORY AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE GOT
GREAT MOVES AGAINST MASSIVE CORRUPTION AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE GOT THE BRAZIL CORRUPTION PROBE WE'VE GOT MALAYSIA AND WE'VE GOT THE THIEF UP AND THIS IS REALLY THE FINAL PIECE IN THE PUZZLE IF YOU CAN ATTACK THE TAX HAVENS THEN THOSE BRAZILIANS WHO WAS WHO WERE LAUNDERING MONEY AND SQUIRRELING IT AWAY IN THE CAYMANS OR WHATEVER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT RIGHT SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT AND RICHARD MURPHY AS WELL THANKS BYE
THAT'S IT FROM US FOR TODAY OUR EDITORS JOHN NEIL AND BE SENT A DAY GOOD MORNING
