THE COLLEGE CARRIED OUT AN AUDIT OF NINE THOUSAND PATIENTS AND FOUND THAT ALMOST ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES WASN'T INFORMED OF THEIR DECISION NOT TO RESUSCITATE THEIR RELATIVE BUT ESTIMATES THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR ON THE SUBJECT OF A DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER THE STUDY FOUND THAT IN SIXTEEN PERCENT OF CASES THERE WAS NO RECORD OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE PATIENT
THE AUDIENCE CHAIRMAN PROFESSOR SAM ALMONDS DESI SAID THAT WAS UNFORGIVABLE AND N.H.S. ENGLAND SPOKESMAN WELCOMED THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT AND SAID THAT WHILE IT SHOWED THERE HAD BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE CARE PROVIDED THERE WAS CLEARLY MORE THAT COULD BE DONE
SCIENTISTS IN BRAZIL SAY THE ZEKE A VIRUS MAY BE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT IS ALREADY KNOWN TO BE THE CAUSE OF MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS NOW EXPERTS HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THE VIRUS MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER DAMAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS WERE A DAVIS REPORTS FROM
MOST DOCTORS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH IS NOW AGREE THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE MOSQUITO BORNE ZEKE A VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH AN ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS BECAUSE OF RESTRICTED BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT WHILE IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE PER CENT OF WOMEN WHO'VE HAD ZICA DURING PREGNANCY WILL HAVE A CHILD WITH MICROCEPHALY DOCTORS IN BRAZIL HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT AS MANY AS TWENTY PERCENT OF ZEKE AFFECTED PREGNANCIES WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF OTHER FORMS OF BRAIN DAMAGE TO THE BABY IN THE WOMB
RATES HAVE INCREASED INFECTION IN SOME PARTS OF BRAZIL HAVE SLOWED THANKS TO BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PREVENTING THE DISEASE BUT WITH HER SEARCH FOR A VACCINE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION

I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO THE WAITERS AND WAITRESSES AND THE COOKS AND THAT SHARED EQUALLY BUT I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT IS OR NOT EVERYONE WHO GETS TIPS HAVE JUST SPLIT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR BECAUSE I GOT A BIT OF A PEOPLE ALL OF YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET THE TIPS I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE TIPS GO TO THE PEOPLE
DO THE WORK I THINK IT'S WRONG IF THE MANAGEMENT PULHAM THE OWNER TAKES THE TIPS AND COUNTS AT SALARY I THINK THAT'S

FOR THE DETAILS I'M GOING TO GO FROM SOUTH EAST TO NORTH WEST SOUTH EAST ENGLAND AND EASTERN ENGLAND FIRST OF ALL DRY FOR MOST OF THE DAY HERE ONE OR TWO SONY INTERVALS A BIT OF RAIN LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON BUT THAT SHOULD CLEAR UP AGAIN BY THIS EVENING AND FEELING MUM AT FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN DEGREES FOR SOUTH WEST ENGLAND AND THE MIDLANDS HERE ARE MOSTLY DRY MORNING EXPECT SOME RAIN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AROUND LUNCH TIME EARLY AFTERNOON BUT THAT WILL CLEAR AGAIN TO SUNNY SPELLS AS THE AFTERNOON WEARS ON HIGHS OF TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DEGREES

THERE IS NO EIGHT MINUTES PASS IF WE HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE MIRROR AND LEEDS WITH A STORY A BOAT CHILDREN AGED SIX GOING ON STRIKE SCHOOL STRIKE THAT HE'S ANGRY PARENTS AS THE MIRROR
HAVE TOLD HOW SATS TESTS ARE LEAVING THEIR CHILDREN STRESSED IN TEARS AND UNABLE TO SLEEP BECAUSE THEY FEAR THEY'RE BEING BRANDED FAILURES AT THE TENDER AGE OF SIX AND THOUSANDS PLANNED TO TAKE THE YOUNGSTERS OUT OF SCHOOL TOMORROW FOR THE KIDS STRIKE IN A BID TO GET MINISTERS TO DITCH THE TOUGHER NEW READING AND MATHS EXAMS THAT ARE GOING TO START ON WEDNESDAY THERE'S A COMMENT IN THE PAPER FROM RUSSELL HOBBY THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE SCHOOL IT WAS UNION THE ANY

TIME'S UP FOR SERVICE CHARGES THAT RESTAURANT SAYS THE TIMES AND THE TELEGRAPH AS WELL AND IT'S FRONT PAGE TIPS COMING OFF THE MENU
THIS IS SUCH A JOB IN THE BUSINESS SECRETARY STARTING CONSULTATIONS TODAY ON WHAT TO DO TO TIGHTEN UP ON TIPPING NOT THE PRACTICE OF TIPPING BUT THE PRACTICE OF RESTAURANTS NOT MAKING IT CLEAR THEY DON'T HAVE TO TIP AND ALSO NOT IN ALL CASES ARE GIVING ALL THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO SEW THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THAT
MANY RESTAURANTS ADD A TEN OR TWELVE POINT FIVE PERCENT SERVICE CHARGE THEIR BILLS MINISTERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS OFTEN LEADS TO DOUBLE TIPPING BECAUSE GOOD CUSTOMERS DON'T NOTICE THEY'VE ALREADY PAID A SERVICE CHARGE BEFORE LEAVING MORE MONEY AND AMONG THE VARIOUS OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED SAYS THE TIMES THE MOST EXTREME WOULD BE TO BAN BUSINESSES FROM ADDING TIPS TO BILL'S OR TO
LITTLE STORY IN THE MAIL ABOUT HOW VOLUNTEERS ARE HAND REARING ORPHANED BABY SQUIRRELS MADE HOMELESS OFF TO THE TREES IN WHICH THEY LIVED WERE CUT DOWN SO EVERYBODY SAYS AH AND THEN YOU REFLECT THAT THESE ARE GREY SQUIRRELS AND THERE WAS A STORY OF APPROVING STORY IN THE PAPERS OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT
PRIME PRIME MARTIN'S PINE MARTINS WELL MAYBE THEM TWO INTRODUCED INTO THE WOODS TO IN ORDER TO KILL GREY SQUIRRELS BECAUSE THEY ARE OF COURSE A PEST SO I SUPPOSE WE SAVE THEM FATTEN THEM UP WITH A NICE BIT OF HAND FED MILK AND THEN
RIPPLE APART WITH PINE MARTIN
THE TIME TEN PARSECS ONLY A FEW DAYS FOR THE BIG ELECTIONS IN EVERY CORNER OF BRITAIN IN SCOTLAND THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY BITING THEIR NAILS COLIN BLAINE IS A SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT EVERYBODY THINKS THE SCOT NATS ARE GOING TO WIN BY A MILE COLIN THAT'S RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE LAST TIME WE HAD SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS THE S.N.P. DID TREMENDOUSLY WELL BUT AND ALL THE POOLS AND I SUGGEST THAT WE DO
JUST AS WELL THIS TIME ROUND AND PERHAPS SLIGHTLY BETTER BUT WE DON'T HAVE AT LEAST SOMETHING LIVELY AT LAST BECAUSE THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN HERE HAS BEEN PRETTY LOW KEY BUT WE HAD A DEBATE A TELEVISED DEBATE LAST NIGHT AND HAVE PRODUCED SOME FIREWORKS ALMOST UNEXPECTED FIREWORKS BECAUSE THE THE BIG ISSUE TURNED OUT TO BE THE BIG ISSUE THAT WAS HAVE ON THE ON THE AGENDA FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS DEPENDENTS EXACTLY BACK TO THE INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM DEBATE
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WAS THAT THE PARTY IS IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE U.K. HAD A REAL GO AT NICOLA STURGEON OVER THE QUESTION OF A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM RUTH DAVIDSON OF THE CONSERVATIVES SAID IT WAS AN OPEN WOUND WHICH WAS DAMAGING THE ECONOMY AND THEN WILLIE RENNIE OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SAID SHE WAS TRYING TO IMPOSE A GROANED HOG DAY
DIDN'T THEY GET THE MESSAGE WE WANT TO STAY IN THE U.K. THE RESPONSE OF COURSE CAME FROM NICHOLAS DODGEM IT WAS IT WAS MEASURED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT BECAUSE THESE ARE ARGUMENTS SHE'S HER BEFORE AND SHE WAS SAYING THAT IT'S A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE IF THERE'S A CLEARANCE OF STEAMED EVIDENCE THAT INDEPENDENCE IS THE PREFERENCE OF THE MAJORITY THEN THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM THAT'S THE FAULT IN SCOTTISH POLITICS I DON'T KNOW PLENTY OF NOISE ABOUT IT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IS SHE GOING TO TEST OF THAT WHETHER THERE IS A REAL APPETITE FOR ANOTHER GIRL
AGAIN THAT WAS THE QUESTION THE OTHERS WERE PUTTING TO HER THEY WERE SAYING LOOK IN THE PAST YOU HAD A VERY CLEAR MANDATE YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE A REFERENDUM IF YOU WON THIS TIME IT'S THIS PERHAPS RATHER VAGUE SUGGESTION THAT YOU'LL HAVE A REFERENDUM
THERE WAS SUSTAINED EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WANT ONCE ALL OF THE OTHER POLITICIANS WERE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE THIS IS HARDLY FAIR OF NICOLA STURGEON SING NO IT'S A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE AND A SECOND REFERENDUM IS VERY MUCH ON THE AGENDA AND INDEED SHE TOLD US THE SCOTTISH SUNDAY NEWSPAPER THAT SHE BELIEVED IT WAS MORE LIKE WITH HER NOT THAT THERE WOULD BE ONE IN HER TIME AS FIRST MINISTER
WELL WE SHALL BE TALKING TO HER AT TEN PAST EIGHT SEE WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT IT THEN THANKS VERY MUCH COLIN FOUND AT TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX FIRST PARTY CONGRESS IN NORTH KOREA IN FORTY YEARS HE'S BEING HELP THIS WEEK A CORRESPONDENT STEVE EVANS UNUSUALLY IS ACTUALLY IN NORTH KOREA'S IN PYONGYANG JOINS US ON THE PHONE THEY'RE FROM THERE NOW AND IS THE FIRST OF ALL WHY ARE YOU THERE HOW DO YOU GET IN
IRON WITH THREE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS ONE
ONE AMERICAN AND ONE ISRAELI AND THEY'RE BASICALLY HAVING A DIALOGUE WITH SCIENTISTS HERE
WITH AN ORGANISATION WHICH BELIEVES IN DIALOGUE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM AROUND
THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PARTY CONGRESS WILL TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT OFF VERY FIRMLY ON FRIDAY AND KIM JONG UN WILL BE
RIGHT BIG TIME
THE LAST ONE WAS JUST THERE WAS NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO
THE PARTY WHICH YOU STAND TO BE RULED NORTH KOREA THEY'VE MANAGED QUITE WELL WELL THEY'VE THEY'VE GOVERNED WITHOUT IT MEETING IMPORTED
MEETING WILL NOT HAVE MUCH
APPLAUSE WHICH WILL BRIDGE GREEK TO KIM JONG ON BUT THIS MORNING
OH WHAT A SHAME OH HE'S GONE
WELL THERE WE ARE THE PERILS OF BROADCASTING FROM NORTH KOREA I SUPPOSE ANYWAY WE MADE ANYWHERE ELSE I CAN TELL YOU MY CLEETHORPES HAYHOE LUCKILY TANYA'S HERE AND IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU HEAR THAT OH GUB GUB GUB YOU'RE TOO MODEST ANYWAY BECAUSE FELL OFF IN THE ASIAN MARKET YES WE'VE SEEN THE JAPANESE MARKET DOWN OVER THREE AND A HALF PER CENT BY THEIR LUNCH TIME CLOTHES FORTUITOUSLY ALSO MARKETS GUEST IS HERE THIS MORNING
RUSS MILES WHO IS INVESTMENT DIRECTOR OF A.J. BELL WELL MEANT TO YOU SO WHAT'S BEHIND THE SELL OFF I THINK THERE WERE TWO THINGS BEHIND THE JAPANESE SELLER FIRST IS THE LACK OF ACTION FURTHER MONETARY POLICY EASING FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN LAST WEEK I THINK THE MARKET GEARED ITSELF OF FURTHER CUTS INTO NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE TERRITORY MAYBE MORE QUANTITY OF EASING AND THE SECOND THING IS SOME VERY WEAK ECONOMIC DEALT A VERY MIXED I SHOULD SAY ECONOMIC DATA FROM CHINA TODAY ONE OF THESE SENTIMENTS SURVEYS ARE PURCHASING MANAGED INDEX CAME IN AT FIFTY POINT ONE
JUST OVER THE THRESHOLD THAT SEPARATES GROWTH FROM CONTRACTION RIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT THE TRANSITION THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS GOING THROUGH AN HOUSE HOW WELL IT'S GOING IT'S PROVING EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF WHICH ISN'T A MAJOR SURPRISE GIVEN IT UP AT THE WORLD'S SECOND BIGGEST ECONOMY IT IS AT LEAST ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF FIFTY BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT CHINESE ECONOMIC STATISTIC OF THE BREAKDOWN THE BEST NUMBERS CAME FROM CONSTRUCTION AND STEEL WHICH IS VERY MUCH OLD CHINA WHERE'S THE SERVICES INDUSTRY DRIVER THEY'RE HOPING FOR
DOES THE MIX IS STILL VERY MUCH OLD CHINA IN TERMS OF WHERE THE GROWTH IS COMING FROM AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE IN JAPAN WHICH IS A BIT BEHIND THE WORRYING YOU SAY THAT THE CENTRAL BANK IS THE DRIVER OF THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS THERE WAS A THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO ENGAGE IN MORE EASING IT HASN'T DONE THAT AT LEAST NOT YET AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT EQUATION IS THAT U.S. CENTRAL BANK IS HOLDING OFF
RAISING INTEREST RATES CORRECT AGAIN I THINK THAT PROBABLY BECAUSE THE U.S. ECONOMY THE G.D.P. NUMBERS LAST WEEK SIMPLY WEREN'T VERY STRONG AND INTERESTING WE'VE GOT THE AMERICAN EQUIVALENT OF THAT JAPANESE OF CHINESE STATISTIC THIS MORNING THE P.M. EITHER POACHERS MANAGED INDEX IT WAS AROUND FIFTY ONE LAST MONTH IF YOU LOOK AT MOST OF THE REGIONAL FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS PHILADELPHIA
RICHMOND THEY'VE JUST COME OUT WITH SOME OF THEIR OWN SURVEYS AND THEY'VE BEGUN TO WEAKEN AGAIN SO IT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH OF A SHOCK IF THE WEST NUMBER ROLLED OVER IT WAS FIFTY ONE POINT EIGHT LAST MONTH THE CONSENSUS IS FIFTY ONE POINT SIX GOT TO BE CHANCE IT COMES IN LOWER THAN THAT AGAIN SUGGESTING THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY AND IT'S ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE
ISN'T FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS RIGHT LET'S PICK UP ON SOME CORPORATE STORIES B.H.S. WE NOW KNOW THAT BOTH PHILIP GREEN AND DOMINIC TRAP THE MORE RECENT OWNER ARE GOING TO BE COOL BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND ASKED ABOUT WHAT MONEY WENT WHERE AND WHEN WHAT MIGHT SEEM A BIT SURPRISING ABOUT THIS IS THAT IF YOU FILE ACCOUNTS AS YOU'RE OBLIGED TO DO AS A COMPANY THIS SHOULD BE
BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS WHAT WENT WHERE AND WHEN AND THESE ACCOUNTS ARE SIGNED OFF BY AUDITORS THEY ARE SIGNED OFF BY ORATORS AND THEY WILL DEFINITELY APPROVE SIGN OFF ON THE BEST OF THE COMPANY IS QUOTE A GOING CONCERN I GUESS THESE ARE THIS IS A PRIVATE COMPANY IT'S NOT PUBLIC SO THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE NECESSARY QUITE AS MUCH INFORMATION OVER THERE ARE STILL ACCOUNTANT RULES YOU SIMPLY TAKE IT WILL IT WILL BE THERE THEY WILL THE RESULT THE NUMBERS MAY BE PUBLISHED A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY THAN THEY WOULD BE FOR A FOR A PUBLIC COMPANY BUT THEY WILL COME OUT
IN THE END YES TO THEN IT'S UP TO PEOPLE TO GO LOOKING I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THE COMMITTEE'S GOING TO START DOING RIGHT NOW IT'S A BIT AFTER THE FACT THEY'RE WHEN SO MANY JOBS ARE AT RISK WERE IT IS A BIT TOUGH ON THE SOUTH AND THAT'S PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION I GUESS THERE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE COMMITTEES WILL BE ADDRESSING ONE WHICH IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COUNTRY WAS MANAGED BEFORE AND AFTER ITS SALE
TWO I GUESS YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT HIGH STREET TRADING IS INCREDIBLY TOUGH IT'S A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS JUST WALKING DOWN OXFORD STREET TO COME TO THE STUDIO THIS MORNING AND SEE HOW MANY FOR SALE ONLY SELL SIGNED YOU UP AND THE THIRD ONE IS THE EFFECTIVE WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN JAPAN AND THE JAPANESE CONTEXT
RECORD LOW INTEREST RATES AND QUANTITY OF EASING DO DO DAMAGE TO SERVICE THEY DO DEPRIVE PENSION FUNDS OF MUCH NEEDED BOMB COUPONS AND INTERESTING COMES THERE ARE THREE ISSUES ALL OF WHICH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ALL RIGHT OF COURSE VERY SIGNIFICANT HOLE IN THE PAN YES AND FOR B.H.S. AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE FRONT OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES NORWAY WEALTH FUND SET TO LAUNCH A CRACKDOWN ON HIGH EXECUTIVE PAY INTERESTING IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO BE PIG
VERY MUCH SO NOT A SHIRE WE MONITOR WITH THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED TO FIFTY COMPANY SAW SHAREHOLDERS COMPLAINED ABOUT PET PACKAGES HAVE THE BEEN AWARD ALSO INTERESTING GIVE IT THIS IS THE SAME DAY THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S LAUNCHING A REVIEW INTO HOW TIPS ARE PAID NOW THAT RELATES TO THE LIVING WAGE SO IT'S A VERY EMOTIVE AND VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK THE NORWEGIAN
SOVEREIGN WEALTH AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN QUITE PASSIVE IN HOW IT'S APPROACHED IT SHAREHOLDINGS IF I CAN BE DONE SOME IT HASN'T LIKED IT'S ALL THE SHARES AND WALKED AWAY I THINK NOW IT SEEMS TO BE TAKING A MORE ACTIVE STEWARDSHIP APPROACH ARE YOU DEBATING WITH A COMPANY CHICK AT THE PARTY VERY MUCH WHAT JOHN CARE WOULD HAVE ADVOCATED IN THE CARE OF YOU HERE IN THE U.K. IN TWENTY TWELVE ARE GOING TO MUCH MORE
COLLEEN'S YOU APPROACH WITH MANAGEMENT HAD TO TRY AND KEEP THEM ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW RIGHT LET'S TURN TO ANOTHER STORY IN THE FRONT OF THE F.T. AND THAT IS E.D.F. THE FRENCH UTILITY FIRM WHICH WAS STRUGGLING TO FIND THE CASH TO BUILD NUCLEAR PLANT IN SOMERSET HINKLEY POINT IS GOING TO GET THAT FROM A SELL OFF ELSEWHERE OF FRENCH ASSETS FRENCH STATE ASA E.D.F. HAS GOT THIRTY SEVEN OR THIRTY EIGHT BILLION EUROS OF DEBT
IT'S ON THE HOOK FOR A MAJOR UPGRADE TO THE FRENCH NUCLEAR FLEET WHICH THEY LOOKING TO EXTEND THEIR LIFE THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER MASSIVE BILL THE COMPANY'S GOT AND SO THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT WHICH OWNS EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE SHARES ANYWHERE HE'S BEEN CALLED UPON TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO E.D.F. TO HELP PROVIDE IT TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOT THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH
AND THE WORKING CAPITAL TO HELP START WORKED AT HELP TO WORKS THAT WORKING WITH MASSIVE NUCLEAR PROJECT IN SOMERSET FOR US BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NOW HAS THE GOLDEN AGE FOR INVESTORS STARTED TO DRAW TO A CLOSE WILL RETURNS FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES WOULD BE MUCH LOWER SAID THAT WE SIMPLY HAVE TO PUT MORE INTO THE PENSION POT
AND WORK A LOT LONGER I SPOKE TO RICHARD DOBBS A DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM MCKENZIE WHOSE REPORT ON ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS TRENDS CAME TO EXACTLY THOSE CONCLUSIONS I STARTED BY ASKING HIM HOW HE SAW WHAT EXACTLY HAD BEEN HAPPENING IN EQUITIES FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES THE LAST THIRTY YEARS DESPITE ALL THE FLUCTUATIONS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN LIVING IN SUPERBOWL MARKET EQUITY RETURNS HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWO PER CENT ABOVE ANNUALLY ABOVE THEIR LONG
RUN TRENDS AND BOMBS HAVE DONE EVEN BETTER BONDS HAVE DONE FOUR PER CENT OUR SENSES THAT THESE WONDERFUL RETURNS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY SOME ECONOMIC TAIL WINDS ANDY'S TAIL WINDS ARE COMING TO AN END AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ENTERING A WORLD WHERE EQUITY AND BOND RETURNS WILL BE TWO TO FOUR PERCENT LOWER THAN LAST THIRTY YEARS THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHERE MOST OF US HAVE GOT RATHER USED TO THESE LONG TERM HIGH RETURNS WE NEED TO BE READY FOR THESE RETURNS WHAT IS THE ROLE OF DEMOGRAPHIC SEAR CLEARLY AS WE
HAVE A MORE TOP HEAVY OR OLDER POPULATION AND INEVITABLY THAT HAS AN EFFECT ON THE WORKFORCE TO THE SIZE OF THE WORKFORCE PEOPLE NEED TO SAVE MORE MONEY FOR THEIR RETIREMENT AND OF COURSE SOME BALANCES THINGS TOO DOESN'T IT YES IF YOU CAN YOU CAN DECIDE AGGREGATE GLOBAL GROWTH INTO TWO THINGS PRODUCTIVITY OUTPUT PER WORKER AND NUMBER OF WORKERS AND IF YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST
THIRTY FIFTY YEARS WE'VE HAD A GROWTH IN BOTH OF THEM WE'VE HAD ABOUT HALF OF THE GRACE COMING FROM GRACE IN PRODUCTIVITY I.E. OUTPUT PER WORKER AND HALF COMING FROM A GROWING NUMBER OF WORKERS AS WE LOOK AT THAT PICTURE GOING FORWARDS THE NUMBER OF WORKERS IS GOING TO GROW MUCH LESS CONTRIBUTING ABOUT POINT THREE PER CENT TO GLOBAL GROWTH BY TWENTY FIFTY AND PRODUCTIVITY STAYS THE SAME WE'LL BE ENTERING A WORLD OF AROUND TWO PER CENT GROSS NOT THE THREE AND A HALF PER CENT WE'VE GOT USED TO
SO WHAT COULD THIS ALL MEANS FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR FAMILIES FOR HOUSEHOLDS A SLOWER RATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ALSO A SLOWER A SLOWER PACE ON THE STOCK MARKET MEAN THE MEANING QUITE SIMPLY THAT SAVINGS DON'T GROW AS FAST ABSOLUTELY I'M AFRAID IT'S PRETTY DIRE YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY TWO TO THREE PER CENT LOWER DOESN'T SOUND VERY MUCH BUT I'M AFRAID IT DOES IF YOU'RE A THIRTY YEAR OLD NOW YOU HAVE TO SAVE TWICE AS MUCH YOU HAVE TO SAVE SOMEWHERE AROUND
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME A YEAR RATHER THAN A THIRTY YEAR OLD THIRTY YEARS AGO ALL YOU HAVE TO RETIRE SEVEN YEARS LATER PLUS YOU HAVE TO RETIRE LATER ANYWAY COS OF INCREASED LIFE EXPECTANCY SO THESE LOWER INVESTMENT RETURNS IT ISN'T SOME SORT OF THEORETICAL CONCEPT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MATTERS JUST BIG BUSINESS THIS MATTERS FOR HOUSEHOLD THE HOUSEHOLD HAS TO FIND A WAY OF
BEING ABLE TO SAVE MORE AND ALSO FIND WAYS OF MANAGING COSTS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THEIR SAVINGS AND OF COURSE IF MORE IS BEING SAVED THEN WE HAVE MORE CASH CHASING PERHAPS A FEW INVESTMENTS OR HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT SIT ALONGSIDE YOUR CLAIM THAT YOU DON'T THINK THE STOCK MARKET'S GOING TO GROW AS MUCH I THINK THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO STILL BE THAT FIRST OF ALL WHILE THE HOUSE OR MAYBE SAVING MORE GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE BORROWING MORE SO A LOT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S SAVINGS GETS CASK OFFSET SECONDLY
RETIREES ARE GOING TO START DRAWING DOWN THEIR SAVINGS SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A REDUCTION AND THIRDLY IF WE LOOK AT A BUNCH OF EMERGING MARKETS AND ANOTHER COUNTRIES DEVELOPING THEM INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN IN COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.K. THE U.S. WE NEED A LOT OF MORE ASSETS SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF THINGS TO INVEST IN IN THE SHORT TERM
SO THAT WAS RICHARD DOBBS A DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING FIRM MCKINSEY NOW NEARLY SIX MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE PARIS CLIMATES TALKS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES MADE AN HISTORIC AGREEMENT TO LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING TO TWO DEGREES ABOVE
INDUSTRIAL LEVELS AND OF COURSE IT CALL FOR AMBITIOUS EFFORTS BRIGHT PRIVATE CORPORATIONS TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE TOO BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE I SPOKE TO GEORGE KEL WHO IS FOUNDER AND FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT THE WORLD'S LARGEST VOLUNTARY CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVE AND BEGAN BY ASKING HIM WHETHER POST PARIS THERE IS STILL MOMENTUM BEHIND HOLT IN CLIMATE CHANGE
ALL GOVERNMENTS AND CREED BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BIG ISSUE SO YES THERE ARE STILL GOOD POLITICAL MOMENTUM BUT CLEARLY TO POLITICAL MOMENTUM ITSELF IS NOT NECESSARY SUFFICIENT THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS CALLED UPON MORE AND MORE TO DO EVER MORE
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE WE SEE REAL CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTS OPERATE OR DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE JUST RELIEVE A QUESTION OF ACCELERATING A PROCESS WHICH IS ALREADY UNDERWAY THERE ARE TWO SCENARIOS POSSIBLE IN MY VIEW ONE IS THERE TO CUT OUT ALL THE CHANGE WHICH HAS ALREADY STARTED ARGUABLY MANY COMPANIES ARE NOT COMMITTED TO CYRIL EMISSIONS OTHER COMPANIES HAVE PUT OUT A VERY CLEAR CREDO SCOUTING MISSION THAT ABDUCTION TARGETS
INVESTORS HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE CLIMB AT RISK THE HSC WE ALSO SEE MANY NEW INSTRUMENTS MARKET INSTRUMENTS IN THE MAKING IN PARTICULAR CARBON PRICING CHINA FOR EXAMPLE WILL INTRODUCE A NATIONAL TRADING SCHEME THIS YEAR IS A MAJOR CORRETTO MOVEMENTS WILL IT BE SUFFICIENT PROBABLY NOT
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS F. TRIPLE SEE THEY ESTIMATE IS THAT EVEN IF THE PERRIS AGREEMENT WERE IMPLEMENTED IN FULL THEN WE WOULDN'T NEED TO TOOL DEGREE CELSIUS TARGET WOULD OVERSHOOT BY AT LEAST TWO POINT SEVEN AND THAT IS A POSITIVE SCENARIO SO MUCH MORE WILL NEED TO BE TONGUE AND THEN THE OTHER LIKELY SCENARIO EARSE THAT MARKETS GOVERNMENTS PEOPLE WILL REACT TO EVENTS
MAJOR DESTRUCTIONS AND EXTREME WEATHER FORMS HOPEFULLY SOCIAL BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE WILL COME IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT CENTRE LIKES THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INCENTIVE DOESN'T THOUGH IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE
ISN'T ENOUGH HOW CAN INVESTORS FIRST OF ALL JUDGE WHETHER COMPANIES ARE DOING WELL IN TERMS OF THEIR COMMITMENTS TO AVOIDING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO IF THEY KAREN
THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT A GROWING NUMBER OFF INVESTORS ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO CARBON MEASUREMENT PRINCIPAL SUPPING INTRODUCED IN THE U.K. FOR EXAMPLE THE C.D. P. CLIMBER DISCLOSURE PROJECT HAS GROWN FROM EIGHTY FIVE COMPANIES TO EIGHT HUNDRED COMPANIES JUST WITHIN A DECADE AND WE HAVE RECENT INDICATIONS THAT INDEED INVESTORS ARE SWITCHING MUCH MORE TOWARDS CLEANER
MORE SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WHAT INCENTIVISE HIS INVESTORS NORMALLY SEE IT'S RETURNS YES THERE ARE TWO BIG ARGUMENTS ONE IS THE STRANDED ASSET ARGUMENT THAT MANY OF THE BIG INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE HIGHER CARBON INTENSIVE AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RATHER SOONER THAN LATER WILL ACTUALLY GO BANKRUPT IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO IT'S BETTER TO GET HOT
FUEL INTENSIVE PORTFOLIOS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE PROMISE OF GREEN INVESTMENT TO HAVE HIRED A RETURNS THE GREEN MARKET IS ACTUALLY GROWING LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY MORE INVESTMENT GOING INTO RENEWABLES THEN INTO FOUR SO FUEL IN A CHEAP PRODUCTION
YORK KEL THERE WHO IS THE FOUNDER AND FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT THEY SO MUCH TURN IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX KNOWN HERE DROP WITH A SPORT SORRY JOHN YES THE CONCLUSION TO THE REMARKABLE STORY OF LEICESTER CITY'S PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE CHALLENGES STILL UNWRITTEN YESTERDAY'S ONE ALL DRAW AT MANCHESTER UNITED MEANS TOTTENHAM CAN STILL BE CHAMPIONS THOUGH THEY'LL HAVE TO WIN AT CHELSEA FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETEEN THE CEILING TO SUSTAIN THAT FAST FADING POSSIBILITY

THE GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING FORWARD PLANS TO CHANGE THE WAY TIPS ARE DEALT WITH IN BARS AND RESTAURANTS MINISTERS WANT TO ENSURE THE PRACTICE IS MORE TRANSPARENT THE CUSTOMERS NO TIPPING IS OPTIONAL AND THAT ALL OF THE TIP GOES TO STAFF
I'VE BEEN ANGRY EXCHANGES ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND A REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DURING A T.V. DEBATE BETWEEN THE LEADERS OF SCOTLAND'S FIVE MAIN PARTIES THE S.N.P. IS NICOLA STURGEON SAID OF PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS NO POLITICIAN HAD THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THEIR WAY BUT THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID THE S.N.P. HAD PROMISED THE LAST REFERENDUM WOULD BE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT
A SMALL TEAM OF BRITISH SOLDIERS HAS ARRIVED IN SOMALIA AS PART OF A UNITED NATIONS MISSION TO COUNTER ISLAMIST MILITANTS THEIR NUMBERS WILL EVENTUALLY REACH ABOUT SEVENTY MADE UP OF MEDICAL LOGISTICAL AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL
AN AMERICAN CRUISE SHIP HAS SET SAIL FOR CUBA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS THE DONA LEFT MIAMI WITH AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED PASSENGERS ON BOARD AND IS DUE TO ARRIVE IN HAVANA TODAY CUBA AND THE U.S. RESTORE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS LAST YEAR
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA IS BREAKING DOWN HAS ALREADY BROKEN DOWN IN THE EYES OF MANY IN THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE IS IN GENEVA YOU TRYING TO KEEP IT ALIVE A CORRESPONDENT BARBARA PLATTER ASHER HAS BEEN TRAVELLING WITH HIM BARBARA WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING BEEN HAPPENING IN ALEPPO CEASEFIRE HARDLY SEEMS THE RIGHT WORD DOES IT NO AS YOU SAID THE CEASEFIRE HAS REALLY BEEN CRUMBLING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO BUT ESPECIALLY IN ALEPPO AND ALL THAT WAS QUITE A DIFFICULT CASE BECAUSE
YOU HAVE AN ISLAMIST REBEL GROUP THERE THAT'S NOT PART OF THE CEASEFIRE ON THE FRONT AND IT'S MIXED TOGETHER WITH REBELS WHO ARE PART OF THE CEASEFIRE SO THE SYRIAN REGIME SAYS IT'S TARGETING ON THE STRAIGHTS TARGETING TERRORISTS BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEPARATE THEM THAT EASILY FROM THE OTHER REBELS ON THE GROUND THERE'S THIS OVERLAP WHICH MEANS EVERYBODY'S GETTING HIT SO THE TUX TODAY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO LOOK AT WAYS AT WHETHER THEY CAN BE SEPARATED MAYBE SOME TALK ABOUT SETTING UP SAFE ZONES FOR CIVILIANS ARE REBELS WHO SIGNED ON TO THE TRUCE
DESIGNATING SPECIFIC AREAS THAT I THINK WILL BE QUITE COMPLEX BUT REALLY THE BIGGER ISSUE HERE WHICH IS NOT PROBABLY GOING TO BE ANSWERING TODAY IS WHAT THE SYRIANS ARE REALLY AFTER WHETHER THEY'RE USING THESE ATTACKS ON ON THERE WHICH ARE PERMITTED BY THE CEASEFIRE TO ACTUALLY SEIZE CONTROL OF THE CITY WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE STRATEGIC GAIN AND A SERVES PEOPLE PLAYING ANY PART IN THESE TALKS
NO THEY ARE OF THE WHOLE PROCESS THIS PEACE PROCESS THAT WAS SET UP AS VERY MUCH A RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN AFFAIR THE IT RELIES ON THEM WORKING TOGETHER FOR A COMMON GOALS FOR THE RUSSIANS PRESSURE THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT THE U.S. PRESSURES THE OPPOSITION FOR THE CEASEFIRE TO FOR DELIVERY OF AID FOR POLITICAL TALKS SO IF IT BREAKS DOWN THEN IT'S THE RUSSIANS AND THE AMERICANS WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER THAT'S WHAT THE U.N. ENVOY CALLED FOR YOU CALLED ON THE PRESIDENTS ARE BOTH COUNTRIES TO FIX THE SYSTEM THEY HAD
CREATED BUT AGAIN IT'S THE QUESTION OF WHAT IF YOU IF YOU WENT IN WITH THE SEWING IN INTENT THERE'S ALSO QUESTION ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INTENT IS IF IN FACT IT IS ACTUALLY WILLING FOR THE SYRIANS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS FAIR TO TAKE A STRATEGIC GROUND SO THAT THE POSITION OF THE SYRIANS ARE STRONGER WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO THE TOX THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE TESTED
SO RUSSIA STILL WANTS TO KEEP US IN POWER
YOU KNOW THE AMERICAN STRATEGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DRIVE THIS WEDGE BETWEEN MOSCOW AND I SAID AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE PUT PRESSURE ON THE REGIME AND THERE'S NO QUESTION I THINK THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN IS FRUSTRATED WITH PRESIDENT ACID ACID FROM TIME TO TIME BUT
I THINK ALSO THAT ARE NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE REGIME HAS EMERGED THAT WOULD KEEP THINGS TOGETHER IN DAMASCUS COOK CAN GUARANTEE OF KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER AT DAMASCUS AND ALSO CRUCIALLY SUPPORT RUSSIAN INTERESTS THERE SO I THINK IT'S A MIXED PICTURE WITH THE RUSSIANS WERE FOLLOW THEIR INTERESTS WHILE THE AMERICANS ARE BANKING ON THEIR RATIONS DECIDING IT WERE ULTIMATELY BE IN THEIR INTEREST TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT SEEN AS LEGITIMATE WITHIN THE COUNTRY MAKES PRETTY DEPRESSING AT THE MOMENT
YES AND VERY COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE BATTLEFIELD IS VERY FLUID YOU HAVE THE SITUATION IN A LEPER WITH THE REBELS BELONGING TO THIS HE'S VERY SOME NOT WHO OVERLAP EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES THEY WORK TOGETHER SOMETIMES THEY SHARE TERRITORY IT'S DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO IT'S QUITE HARD TO ENFORCE THE VERY A CEASEFIRE IN SUCH A FLUID SITUATION
AND THEN IT'S ALSO QUITE DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE IF THE GO STRATEGIC GOALS ARE DIFFERENT I MEAN IN THE AMERICANS DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH LEVERAGE BECAUSE IF THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT ON BOARD AS THEY WOULD LIKE IT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CREDIBLE THREATS OR PRESSURE THEY CAN EXERT THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND MILITARILY SUPPORTING ONE SIDE OF THE CIVIL WAR QUITE ACTIVELY THE U.S. IS NOT IT'S NOT SUPPORTING REBELS
IN THE SAME WAY SO MY KERRY INSISTS THAT HE'S NOT GIVING THE RUSSIANS ARE FREE HAD HE SPOKEN SORT OF CRYPTICALLY HAVE A PLAN B. WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD INVOLVE BUT HE DOES RISK BEING PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE IF HE CONTINUES TO INSIST ON DIPLOMACY WHAT THE RUSSIANS CHANGE OF FACTS ON THE GROUND BARBARA THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN SCIENTISTS ARE SUGGESTING THAT ZEKE A VIRUS IN SOUTH AMERICA IS DOING EVEN MORE DAMAGED THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT WHERE A IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BRAZIL
IT'S ACCEPTED NOW THAT THE SEEKER AND MICROCEPHALY ARE LINKED THIS DAMAGING CONDITION IN BABIES BABIES BORN WITH ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS BUT
IT'S THOUGHT THAT ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF MOTHERS WHO'VE HAD SEEKER WILL HAVE A BABY WITH MICROCEPHALY THAT'S PRETTY MUCH GIVEN WHAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY MORE THAN ONE SOURCE
AS MANY AS TWENTY PERCENT ONE IN FIVE OF MOTHERS WHO'VE HAD DURING THEIR PREGNANCY WILL HAVE A BABY WITH SOME SORT OF NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY MICROCEPHALY IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING LESS OBVIOUS LESS DAMAGING BUT IT'S A STARTLING FIGURE THAT RESEARCHERS IN BRAZIL WE HAVE SPOKEN TO HERE IN RIO
AND A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ARE BOTH NOW SAYING THAT THESE FIGURES OF OVER TWENTY PER CENT ONE IN FIVE OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH A SEEKER WILL HAVE A BABY WITH SOME SORT OF DAMAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION IT'S QUITE ALARMING AND IS THE INCIDENCE OF SIKA INFECTION STILL GREY
THAT IS THE ONLY GOOD NEWS I THINK COMING OUT OF PARTIAL GOOD NEWS COMING OUT OF WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED A BIT BECAUSE A BETTER PUBLIC AWARENESS IN BRAZIL THE RATE OF INCREASE OF GET INFECTION IS SLOWING DOWN IT'S STILL INCREASING IT STILL SPREADING ACROSS BRAZIL COLOMBIA VENEZUELA MOST OF SOUTH AMERICA HAS HAD MORE CASES OBVIOUSLY BUT AMONGST CERTAIN SOCIAL GROUPS IN BRAZIL
BECAUSE A BETTER PROTECTION MOSQUITO REPELLENT THAT MOSQUITO NETS BETTER AWARENESS THE RATE OF INCREASE IS SLOWING DOWN THE BAD NEWS IS THAT AMONG THE POORER SECTORS OF SOCIETY WHICH
MOST OF BRAZILIAN SOCIETY THAT IS NOT THE CASE RATES OF THE SEEKER MICROCEPHALY ARE INCREASING AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE
PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN TARGETED IN CAMPAIGNS OR THEY ARE CULTURALLY NOT USED TO USING MUSKET OR A COLOURED THEY FIND IT TOO EXPENSIVE SO THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS AND UPFRONT FRONT BUT IT IS STILL
BIG BIG PROBLEM FROM BRAZIL PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW ZEKE UP WORKS WE'VE SPOKEN TO SOME NEW NEURO SCIENTISTS WHO SAY THEY WERE REALLY SURPRISED BY HOW AGGRESSIVE THERE'S A VIRUS WAS WHERE THEY TESTED IT ON CELLS IN THE LAB AND THERE'S A LOT YET WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS
WHERE A DAVIS IN PRISON THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S GETTING INVOLVED IN TIPPING THE WAY WE TIP GILL LINE AND AS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JO IF THIS IS THE BUSINESS SECRETARY WANTING CONSULTATION BEFORE NEW LAWS WHAT'S IT TO DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT
HELLO YEAH JOKE AN EARLY I'LL JUST ABOUT I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT YEAH BASICALLY A LOT HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT THERE IS NO LAW FORCING RESTAURANTS AND OVER TIPS TO STUFF THERE'S A VOLUNTARY CODE IN PLACE WHICH MOST RESTAURANTS ADHERE TO
AND THERE WAS UPROAR AT LAST YEAR WON QUITE A FEW WELL KNOWN CHAINS RESTAURANT CHAINS WERE RETAINING ALL OF THE SERVICE CHARGE WHICH CUSTOMERS PAY TO THEIR STAFF WOMEN ADDED TO THEIR BILL AND SOMEWHAT DEDUCTING FOR ADMINISTRATION FEE FROM THE TIPS BUT SOME WERE PROPPING UP THE HOURLY WAGES OF STAFF
SO SUCH A JAB IN THE BUSINESS SECRETARY CALLED FOR INITIATIVE A OR A REVIEW AND NOW HE'S GOING ONE STEP FURTHER WITH THE CONSULTATION DOCUMENT WHICH SETS OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S THINKING ON TIPS RIGHT AND WHAT THEY COULD DO PRESUMABLY IS WHAT
MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR THE RESTAURANT NOT TO SHARE THEIR TIPS OR INDEED GIVE THE TIPS TO THE STAFF THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT HE'S SAYING IF THIS NEW IS STRICTER VOLUNTARY COLDEST ARE PUT IN PLACE
IT DOESN'T WORK AND COMPANIES DON'T ADHERE TO THE NEW COLD THEN HE WILL LEGISLATE YES ALL TIPS HAVE WE GIVEN TO STAFF BUT RESTAURANTS MUST ALSO SHOW JOHN THAT SERVICE CHARGES AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BILL A VOLUNTARY OBLIGED TO GIVE
A TIP SO HE COULD WEAR TO THE DETRIMENT OF STAFF ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DID THE SERVICE CHARGE IS OBLIGATORY WOULD BE THE IDEA OF KNOCKING OFF THE SERVICE CHARGE WHEN HE JUST WOULDN'T DO IT WOULD YOU WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T I'M SURE MOST PEOPLE DO THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE PAY IT IT'S FINE BUT IF YOU DO GET BAD SERVICE OR WHATEVER REASON YOU'RE GREAT THANKS VERY MUCH I'M NOT I'M NOT PAYING THAT TO OPEN UP HE SAID WELL WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES OF THE CONSULTATIONS
THE TIME TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE AND COVERAGE OF LABOUR'S ANTI SENATORS AND ROW CONTINUES FOR THE EITHER MAIN STORIES THE ADMISSION FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S KEY ALLY DIANE ABBOTT THAT THE PARTY FACES ANOTHER LEADERSHIP BATTLE BUT ONCE SHE'S CONFIDENT HE WOULD WIN THE SON SEES HER INSISTENCE THAT
THE CLAIMS WERE A SMEAR IS A PATHETIC ATTEMPT AT BLAME SHIFTING IN THE NEW DAY JULIE BURCHILL ARGUES THAT WHAT STARTED WITH A REASONABLE DESIRE TO BE ANTI RACIST AS TURNED LABOUR INTO A ROTTING EDIFICE FATALLY RIDDLED WITH ANTI CEMETERIES AND WHICH IS NOW SHE SAYS A CYNICAL BID FOR MUSLIM VOTES THE DAILY MIRROR'S KEVIN MAGUIRE SAYS THE TORIES ARE DEMONISING LABOUR'S CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF LONDON HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE'S A MUSLIM AND THEIR ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM A SICKENING OPPORTUNIST HYPOCRISY
FAMILIES OF THE DARK IS HOSPITALS LET PATIENTS DIED THAT IS THE LEAD HEADLINE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND IT'S ABOUT AN AUDIT SHOWING UP TO FORTY THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR I HAVE BEEN DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDERS SECRETLY IMPOSED AS THE PEOPLES OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS FOUND THAT ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES WAS NOT INFORMED
BUT IT WAS IN PLACE THE PAPER THINGS THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE BOTH AS A BREACH OF THE BASIC DUTY OF CARE AND BECAUSE IT DISPLAYS WHAT IT CALLS A WORRYING ARROGANCE THAT DOCTORS ALWAYS KNOW BEST THE MALE REPORTS THAT CAUSE THE CONTROVERSIAL BILLIONAIRE BOSS OF SPORTS DIRECT MIKE ASHLEY IS PLANNING TO RESCUE B.H.S. AND IT SAYS VYING TO SAVE ALL THE JOBS AND STORES THEIR TIMES ME MILES HAS A GROWING CHORUS OF PUBLIC FIGURES
THE QUESTION THE SUITABILITY OF A KNIGHTHOOD AWARDED THE FIRM'S FORMS FORMER OWNER SIR PHILIP GREEN THE MIRROR MEANWHILE US PICTURES OF SIR PHILIP ON HIS THIRTY TWO MILLION POUND YACHT MONICA YESTERDAY AS IT SAYS ELEVEN THOUSAND B.H.S. WORKERS STILL FEAR FOR THEIR JOBS THE TRAGEDY HAD BEEN BETRAYED AFGHAN HEROES THE LEAD TO HEADLINE FOR THE MALE AS AN INTERPRETER WHO WORK FOR THE BRITISH ARMY IN AFGHANISTAN HAS KILLED HIMSELF AFTER BEING TOLD THAT HE DID NOT QUALIFY FOR ASYLUM IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE DEPORTED
HE IS THE MALE SAYS IT IS A TRAGEDY HIS DEATH SHAMES OUR NATION AND HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGER FACED BY SOME SIX HUNDRED OTHER INTERPRETERS STILL IN AFGHANISTAN
THE DAILY STAR THE MAIN STORY SUGGESTION THAT RYAN GIGGS WHO FOUR YEARS AGO FOR A LONG LEGAL BATTLE TO BLOCK REPORTS OF AN AFFAIR FACES WHAT IT CALLS A TWENTY MILLION POUND DIVORCE PENALTY THE DAILY EXPRESS AS A FORMER MANCHESTER UNITED AND WALES FOOTBALLERS GIVEN THE RED CARD BY HIS WIFE OR FLIRTING WITH WAITRESSES THAT HIS REST
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE PHRASE THE BANK OF MUM AND DAD WILL THE GUARDIAN HAS COINED A NEW ONE THIS MORNING BANK OF SON AND DAUGHTER READ A STUDY HAS FOUND THAT NEARLY HALF OF PARENTS ADMITTED DIPPING INTO THEIR CHILDREN'S PIGGY BANKS
CHILDREN STILL A PIGGY TO BELIEVE IN THE STAR SAYS TOP REASONS GIVEN RANGE FROM SCHOOL TRIPS TO HAIRCUTS AND TAKEAWAYS THE TELEGRAPH NOTES MOTHERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE THE MONEY BUT FATHERS
WERE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE EVEN BIGGER AMOUNTS I'M WHO'D ADMIT BUT HE JUST WOULDN'T WOULD YOU IT IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS HAS HOSPITALS ARE PLACING DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDERS ON THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS WITHOUT THEIR FAMILIES THEIR KNOWLEDGE
RIGHT AROUND THE U.K. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VOTING ON THURSDAY IN THE BIGGEST SET OF ELECTIONS OUTSIDE A GENERAL ELECTION READY FOR SOME YEARS BUT IN SOME PLACES WELL THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE TOO MUCH MOTORS IN WALES WILL ELECT MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MUCH OF THE CAMPAIGNING HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THEIR TATA STEEL CRISIS THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND THERE'S A REAL CHANCE IT HAVE A VERY LOW TURN OUT OF THE CANDIDATES MAKE THEIR FINAL PUSH A CORRESPONDENT HOW GRIFFITH HAS BEEN TO ONE OF THEIR KEY MARGINAL CONSTITUENCIES CARDIFF NORTH TO TESTAMENT
YOUR LOUNGE IS I'D LIKE YOU TO DROP INTO YOUR PRESS OUTSIDE ON YOUR KNEES ON YOUR
RETCHING EVERY SINEW WHILE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE CHILDREN THEIR MOTHERS EXERCISING AT THE WEEKLY BUGGY FIT SESSION IN THE HEATH AREA OF CARDIFF PLENTY TO WORRY ABOUT BESIDES THURSDAY'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION
DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES AT STAKE I TRY TO WATCH THEIR DEBATE THERE ARE NIGHTS BUT I WAS IN BED BEST FEET IN THEIR LITTLE ONE SO SORT OF SLIGHTLY
DISTRACTED IF YOU DO GO ON VOTE WHAT ISSUES WILL BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION ARE DEFINITELY HEALTH CODES CAN ALWAYS BE A PRIORITY FOR MYSELF AT ALL
PROBABLY NEED TO RECEIVE SOME MORE OF WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING IT'S IN THE PARTY
IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT HEALTH FEATURES ON MANY PEOPLE'S LIST WALES'S LARGEST HOSPITAL IS ONLY BUT A MILE AWAY FROM WHERE I'M STANDING AND N.H.S. SPENDING TAKES UP NEARLY HALF OF THE WELSH LABOUR GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET BUT ITS RECORD IN POWER FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS IS UNDER ATTACK
LABOUR'S JULIE MORGAN WHO TOOK THIS SEAT FROM THE TORIES IN TWENTY ELEVEN EXCEPT THERE ARE PROBLEMS BUT SHE SAYS THEY'RE NOT ALL CAUSED BY THE POLITICIANS
OBVIOUSLY THE HEALTH SERVICE IS UNDER PRESSURE HE'S UNDER PRESSURE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LIVING OLDER THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF NEW TREATMENTS AVAILABLE SO THE HEALTH SERVICE IS UNDER PRESSURE BUT I'M VERY PROUD TO STAND ON THE RECORD OF THE HEALTH SERVICE IN WALES WHERE THE WAITER LONGER THAN ACROSS THE BORDER IN ENGLAND WE HAVE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE MY I YOU'RE NOT DENYING THAT BUT WHO SAY THAT THE WAITING LISTS ARE LONGER THAN IN ENGLAND WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN ENGLAND
THAT'S IT THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE BEN GREAT FROM THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE LOOKING TO TAKE BACK CARDIFF NORTH IS JANE COWAN SHE SAYS HEALTH IS HER NUMBER ONE CAMPAIGN ISSUE BUT IT'S A CAMPAIGN WHICH HAS HAD TO COMPETE WITH A NEWS AGENDA DOMINATED BY OTHER DEBATES
LIKE YOU MEMBERSHIP THE WELSH TORY LEADER ANDREW A T. DAVIS ONCE A BRECK SUIT SO HAS THAT MUDDIED THE WATERS ANDREW HE'S A FANTASTIC LEADER AND HE'S BEEN OUT ON THE DOORSTEP CAMPAIGN IN WITH US AND IT'S NOT A DISTRACTION IN THE SPADE IT IS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN HE WANTS A BRICKS IT WHAT BUT IT'S ONE VOTE AND THE CHOICE AND AFTER THE ELECTION WE'VE GOT TEN WEEKS AND THEY WERE CAN CAMPAIGN ON THE PRO SIDE ON THE AGAINST SIDE AND THAT'S WHEN THAT DISCUSSION TO TAKE PLACE
ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR RICHARD WYNN JONES FROM CARDIFF UNIVERSITY IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ALL PARTIES TO GET THEIR MESSAGES THROUGH AHEAD OF THURSDAY'S VOTE THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE TUT A STEEL CRISIS WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR COMMUNITIES RIGHT ACROSS WALES ACTUALLY BUT ALSO BY THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD THE COMPLEXION OF THE WELSH GOVERNMENT IS JUST NOT AS IMPORTANT
THE U.K. AND INDEED THE WORLD AS THE CONTINUING MEMBERSHIP OF THE U.K. OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THE U.K. CHOOSING TO LEAVE EUROPEAN THAT IS A WORLD HISTORIC QUESTION
YOUR HEART I'M STANDING WITH UKIP RIGHT THERE IS ONE PARTY WHICH MAY END UP BENEFITING FROM THE FOCUS BEING ON THE E.U. THE POLL SUGGEST UKIP ARE ON COURSE TO WIN THEIR FIRST SEATS IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUT AS THEIR CANDIDATE IN CARDIFF NORTH HAYDN RUSHWORTH ACKNOWLEDGES THERE HAVE BEEN VERY PUBLIC PROBLEMS AFTER A CALAMITOUS CANDIDATE SELECTION PROCESS
I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE COME INTO THIS LATE IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS PRESENTED TO ME WITH ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND I'VE COME INTO THIS LATE AND I I HAVEN'T HAD CHANCE TO NOT THE DOORS YOU'VE NOT BEEN KNOCKING DOORS NO I HAVEN'T HAD CHANCE I HAD SOME CONVENTIONAL POLITICS EVEN FOR YOU
I CAN SEE WHY IT LOOKS DISORGANISED IT WOULD BE A SHAME IT WOULD BE A DREADFUL SHAME FOR PEOPLE TO GET DISTRACTED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN GOING
THE OTHER PARTY MAKING PROGRESS IN THE POLLS IS PLY COUNTRY WHO COULD BECOME THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE SENATE AFTER LABOUR PLIGHT HAS BEEN IN COALITION WITH LABOUR BEFORE BUT LOCAL CANDIDATE ELLEN WALKER JONES ISN'T TOO KEEN TO TALK ABOUT ANY NEW SORT OF DEAL
HE WANTS TO BE IN GOVERNMENT ON MAY THE SIXTH NOT PROPPING UP ANYBODY SO YOU WOULDN'T SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH
PLATE CAN BE WANTS TO BE IN GOVERNMENT ON MAY THE SIXTH IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR POLICIES IN PLACE WOULD YOU COME TO
WELL PLAYED COME THESE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST OPINION POLLS PLAYED CAN LOSE BUSILY CATCHING UP WITH LABOUR'S SO I WOULD SAY WATCH OUT ON ME THERE
WILL ALSO BE A TEST FOR THE LIB DEMS IN WALES AFTER A BRUTAL U.K. GENERAL ELECTION LAST YEAR
IN FEAR OF A WELSH WIPEOUT IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BUT ACCORDING TO ALINA PARROT THE PARTY'S LEARNT LESSONS PARTICULARLY ON THE THEME OF EDUCATION I THINK THAT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT US THAT WE NEED TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME TALKING TO PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THEIR CANOE
IN TERMS OF THE TUITION FEES DEBATE WAVE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO STUDENTS STUDENTS UNIONS AND UNIVERSITIES FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THEY NEED FROM THE FROM THE FUTURE OF THEIR UNIVERSITY FUNDING AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD A MAINTENANCE GRANT FOR STUDENTS COS IT'S ACTUALLY DAY TO DAY FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WHICH PEOPLE CAN TRUST YOUR PLEDGE THIS TIME ROUND ABSOLUTELY IS FULLY COSTED AND IT'S DELIVERED AS PART OF
YOU HELP AS WE CAN GO STRAIGHT BEHIND BACK AT BUGGY FIT I SPOKE TO PLENTY OF UNDECIDED VOTERS WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THE PARTIES HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT BEFORE THERE SHE IS RIGHT
WIRRAL DAVIES REPORTING THERE FROM WALES THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN THE MASSIVE AND WILDLY EXPENSIVE PLANS TO BUILD A GREAT HIGH SPEED RAILWAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH H. S. TWO MIGHT BE DERAILED BY A TINY FAMILY
HEDGEHOGS SOUNDS LIKE A CUTE KITTY STORY BUT IT'S TRUE MAYBE YOU WARWICK IS FROM THE BRITISH HEDGEHOG PRESERVATION SOCIETY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN AND THE THING ABOUT THESE IS THERE IT'S A LITTLE GROUP OF WILD HEDGEHOGS LIVING OF A ROYAL PARK AT THE LAST
OF THEIR KIND THAT'S TO SAY THERE AREN'T ANY ROYAL PARKS WITH WILD HEDGEHOGS IN THEM APART FROM THIS ONE IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED IN THAT THERE'S BEEN A RESEARCH STUDY UNDER WAY FOR THE LAST TWO TWO YEARS IN REGENT'S PARK YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE FIFTY YEARS AGO ALL THE ROYAL PARKS HAD HEDGEHOGS AND AS I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE THERE'S BEEN A NATIONWIDE DECLINE IN THEIR NUMBERS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IS HOW
HOW IS IT THE REGENT'S PARK HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN ITS HEDGEHOG POPULATIONS AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY VARIED HABITAT PART OF IT'S DOWN TO ITS SIZE AND CAN ACTIVITY INTO OTHER AREAS BUT WHAT THIS RESEARCH STUDY FOUND WAS THAT THIS PARTICULAR PATCH OF CAR PARK BY LONDON ZOO IS A FAVOURED AREA BEING USED BY THE HEDGEHOGS ARE USING IT FAR MORE THAN THEY USE OTHER PARTS OF THE PARK AND IF THAT AREA IS REMOVED
FROM THE PARK AS A WHOLE IT THREATENS TO SHIFT TO DEKA PARK'S CAPACITY TO HAVE A VIABLE POPULATION THAT ARE DRIVING THE H. S. TWO THROUGH REGENTS PARK ARE THEY NO NO NO NO THIS IS A COMPOUND FOR HEAVY LIFTING GEAR FOR LORRIES AND THINGS WHICH IS GOING TO BE PUT ON THIS AREA AND IT'S SOMETHING WHICH WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF THE ENTIRE IMPACT OF H. S. TWO POTENTIALLY ALONG ITS ROUTE
THIS IS FRAGMENTING REGENT'S PARK'S CAPACITY TO HAVE A POPULATION OF HEDGEHOGS H. S. TWO ALONG ITS ROUTE IS GOING TO BE FRAGMENTING THE COUNTRY IT'LL BE SPLITTING IT INTO TWO CREATING SMALLER POCKETS OF WILDLIFE AND THEREFORE REDUCING WILDLIFE'S ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE
RIGHT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE SORTED THEY CAN FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PARK THE LORRIES THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH I'M CERTAINLY THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON IS PETITIONING THE HOUSE OF LORDS HOPING THAT THAT WILL BE THE CASE I IT'S SOMETHING WHICH SURELY IS A REASONABLE OPTION THAT THE DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO USE THAT PATCH I IMAGINE ENTIRELY BASED AROUND ECONOMICS I'M VERY KEEN THAT ECONOMICS IS GIVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION TO THE ECOLOGY OF THINGS BEFORE IT GOES
BLUNDERING IN THERE WITH THE VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT OF POUND SITES BUT SURELY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU COULD JUST ROUND UP THE HEDGEHOGS AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE NICE I MEAN AFTER ALL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HEDGEHOGS BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T WANT TO LIVE IN A CAR PARK ANYWAY I CAN'T PUT HIM IN A NICE SORT OF LEAFY SPOT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY JOHN FOR THE FIRST PART I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU HELPING ME DO A ROUND UP OF HEAD ALL RIGHT WAS BE BRITISH BUT IS THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME RECENT WORK THAT'S BEEN
FUNDED BY THE BRITISH HEDGEHOG PRESERVATION SOCIETY AND THE PEOPLE'S TRUST FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES SHOWS THAT FOR A VIABLE POPULATION FOR POPULATION OF HEDGEHOGS TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE IT NEEDS A MINIMUM AREA OF NINETY HECTARES THAT'S THREE EIGHTEEN HOLE GOLF A LOT IT'S A LARGE AREA SO YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR BUNCH OF HEDGEHOGS FROM REGENT'S PARK AND TO SHIFT THEM OFF TO THE SUBURBS BUT IF
THAT AREA IS NOT A CONNECTED HABITAT BIG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION THEY WILL SIMPLY DIE OUT AND THEY DID SO WELL YOU SAW HEDGEHOGS EVERYWHERE NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO THAT'S BECAUSE OUR ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT AS FRAGMENTED AS IT WAS THIS IS WHY WE SET UP A PROJECT CALLED HEDGEHOG STREET AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING YESTERDAY SAW THE BEGINNING OF HEDGEHOG AWARENESS WEEK IT'S OF GREAT WEEK FOR HEDGEHOGS WE NEED TO SEE
MORE CONNECTIVE ITY CAN ACTIVITY IS CRUCIAL FOR ALL WILDLIFE BUT HEDGEHOGS ARE A BRILLIANT ANALOGUE FOR ALL OF THE OTHER WILDLIFE WHICH DOESN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF WINGS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE MAKE HOLES AND OFFENCES TO LET HEDGEHOGS GET THROUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE GOT THE CAPACITY TO MOVE THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT WELL I THINK WE CAN SAY WE ALL LIKE HEDGEHOGS DON'T BE THAT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL GOOD LUCK WITH THE HUGH WARWICK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED
SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHY DON'T YOUNG PEOPLE VOTE WHEN I HAVE TO THINK THAT IT'S A WORLDWIDE TREND BUT ACTUALLY WITHIN EUROPE SOME COUNTRIES ITALY FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE YOUNG VOTING IN GREATER PROPORTIONS THAN THE OLD TO THE IMPACT OF COURSE HAVE THAT WERE TO BE REPEATED HERE WOULD BE POTENTIALLY QUITE PROFOUND CUT SMELL SMITS RESEARCHER IN POLITICS DEPARTMENT ROYAL HOLLOWAY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON WORKED ON THIS WORKS IN THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW THIS MONTH GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITALY AND HERE
I THINK IN ITALY WHAT'S HAPPENING AS YOUNG PEOPLE STAY AT HOME FOR A VERY LONG TIME HE TURNS A NOTORIOUS ESTATE STAYING HOME WITH THEM ON US AND I THINK THAT IMPLIES A YOUNG EWE TOWNS ARE MUCH MORE AND BETTER TO IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR SOCIETY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE U.K. AND IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IS DAD DOES ALSO DELAY TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD
WHAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE IS DAD
COMPARED TO YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND DES WERE YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS STAY IN SCHOOL NUMBER THEREFORE THEY START YOUR FIRST JOB ER DAY BUY THEIR FIRST HOUSE LATER GET MARRIED MADE A DAY START TO HAVE HAVE CHILDREN MAITRE BUT ALL OF THESE LIFECYCLE EVENTS ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO VOTER TURNOUT SO WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY DELAYING THIS TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD
BASICALLY IMPLIES DAT FEWER YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO DISS LIFECYCLE EVENTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT WHAT WE SEE IN ITALY IS PROBABLY THAT THERE IS THEY DELAYED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT BECOMES POSITIVE ACTUALLY MATURE AT HOME AND HE SAID YES YOU ME AND THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE CONCERN PEOPLE WHEN THEY VOTE YET HOME EXACTLY VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT HAPPY YOU'VE ALSO
DISCOVERED HAVEN'T YOU THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU VOTE IN THE FIRST ELECTION WHERE YOU COULD VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT YES IT'S NOT JUST THE FIRST ELECTION BUT IT'S HER FIRST FEW ELECTIONS SO WE SAY THE FIRST TWO TREE ELECTIONS AND DUST BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT YET SAID IN THEIR POLITICAL WAY
SO IT TAKES A WHILE TO DEVELOP YOUR A POLITICAL ATTITUDE TO YOUR PATTERNS OF POLITICAL BEHAVIOUR SO RHEA FOUND IN IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH THAT IF YOU INDEED DO NOT VOTE IN THE FIRST ELECTIONS YOU FACE AS A FLOATER THEN YOU ARE LESS LIKELY YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP A PATTERN OF ABSTENTION SO YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO TURN LATER IN LIFE AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING FOR THOSE WHO WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO VOTE AND GREATER NUMBERS ARE WHAT
NOT AN EASY THING ACTUALLY HE'S HAD TO DEAL WITH WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING A RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE TRENDS YES YOU'RE RIGHT OF COURSE GOVERNMENTS CANNOT INFLUENCE INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUAL TRAJECTORIES TOWARDS ADULTHOOD BUT WHAT GOVERNMENTS CAN DO OF COURSE IS ASSIST YOUNG PEOPLE TO BECOME STABLE AND INDEPENDENT EARLIER A KNIFE SO FOR EXAMPLE BY DETECTING NUDE UNEMPLOYMENT BY TAKING THE HOUSING CRISIS
BY MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE GOOD CHILDCARE FACILITIES DOLLS ARE ALL MEASURES WOULD FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD AND THEREFORE ALSO POLITICAL PARTY HAS HAD SOME MIGHT SAY THOSE WON'T COME UNLESS YOUNG PEOPLE VOTE IN THE FIRST PLACE A BIT OF A CHICKEN ADEQUATE ABSOLUTELY IT IS A CHICKEN AND EGG STORY OF COURSE IF SHE'LL BE PEOPLE DONE FOR POLITICIANS WILL PAY THAT'S ATTENTION TO THEM CATS MATS FROM THE POLITICS FARM AT ROYAL HOLLOWAY UNIVERSITY THANKS VERY MUCH
AND IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST AND PETER GIBBS HAS GOT HIS THUMB HAVE TO CREAM READY BELIEVE COMING SUMMER OFFICIALLY STARTS THIS WEEK WELL LET'S NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY MAYBE INTO THE LOW TWENTIES BY THE END OF THE WEEK BUT THAT WILL BE A BIG CHEQUE FROM WHAT WE FOUND THAT'S FOR SURE BUT IT'S BANK HOLIDAY TODAY OF COURSE THERE'S A BIT OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST BUT A RELATIVELY MILD START

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE SECOND OF MAY THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SAYS THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES AREN'T TOLD THAT HOSPITALS HAVE PLACE DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDERS ON RELATIVES SCIENTISTS SAY THERE ZEKE A VIRUS MAY BE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN PREVIOUSLY REALISED AND THE AMERICANS ARE CALLING A RUSSIA TO HELP SAVE THE CRUMBLING CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY ZEB SENSE
AN AUDIT HAS FOUND THE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS ARE HAVING DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDERS IMPOSED ON THEM WITHOUT THE FAMILY'S CONSENT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SAID HOSPITALS WERE OFTEN FAILING TO TELL RELATIVES THAT POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING TECHNIQUES WOULD NOT BE USED AT IMPORTER HAS THE DETAILS
THE COLLEGE CARRIED OUT AN AUDIT OF NINE THOUSAND PATIENTS AND FOUND THAT ALMOST ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES WASN'T INFORMED OF THEIR DECISION NOT TO RESUSCITATE THEIR RELATIVE OFTEN THAT WAS DUE TO THERE BEING NO RELATIVES OR NONE WHO COULD BE FOUND THE COLLEGE ESTIMATES THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS A YEAR OF THE SUBJECT OF A DO NOT RESUSCITATE ORDER THE STUDY FOUND THAT IN SIXTEEN PERCENT OF CASES THERE WAS NO RECORD OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE PATIENT
THE AUDIENCE CHAIRMAN PROFESSOR SAM ASKED WORDS I SAID THAT WAS UNFORGIVABLE HE ALSO SAID DOCTORS NEEDED TO BE MORE OPEN WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE DYING AND HAVE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS EARLIER
AN N.H.S. ENGLAND SPOKESWOMAN WELCOMED THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT AND SAID THAT WHILE IT SHOWED THERE HAD BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE CARE PROVIDED THERE WAS CLEARLY MORE COULD BE DONE
SCIENTISTS IN BRAZIL SAY HE GUEVARA'S MAY BE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT IS ALREADY KNOWN TO BE THE CAUSE OF MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS NOW EXPERTS HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE VIRUS MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER DAMAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AFFECTING ONE IN FIVE PREGNANT WOMEN WHO CONTRACTS ZIGGO THE FINDINGS COME JUST THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE START OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN RIO A CORRESPONDENT WERE A DAVIS IS IN THE CITY
MOST DOCTORS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS NOW AGREED THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE MOSQUITO BORNE ZEKE A VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS BECAUSE OF RESTRICTED BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT WHILE HE'S ESTIMATED THAT ONE PER CENT OF WOMEN WHO'VE HAD ZICA DURING PREGNANCY WILL HAVE A CHILD WITH MICROCEPHALY
DOCTORS IN BRAZIL HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT AS MANY AS TWENTY PER CENT OF ZIG AFFECTED PREGNANCIES WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF OTHER FORMS OF BRAIN DAMAGE TO THE BABY IN THE WOMB WITH THE URGENCY TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT ZEKE AND DEVELOP A VACCINE SOME RESEARCHERS ARE USING STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE NEW CELLS OR DEVELOP LIKE HUMAN BRAINS THEY CALL THEM MANY BRAINS AND INFECT THEM WITH ZEKE
NEAR A SCIENTIST PATRICIA GAV SAYS SAID THEY WERE SHOCKED BY WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WE WERE ALL ASTONISHED BY
FAST EFFECT WE SAW FELLED THIS
THREE DAYS WE SAW RADIUM MASSIVE CELL DEATH IN SIX DAYS THE NEWER ASTURIAS OH COMPLETELY GONE
WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE WERE AIM REALLY IMPRESSED HOW POWERFUL HOW
RATES HAVE INCREASED IN SIKA INFECTION IN SOME PARTS OF BRAZIL HAVE SLOWED THANKS TO BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PREVENTING THE DISEASE BUT WITH HER SEARCH FOR A VACCINE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION

THE FIGHTING IN A LEVEL HAS A BENDED TWO MONTHS OF RELATIVE CALM AND STYLED PEACE TALKS SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE THE U.S. BLAMES THE ESCALATION OF THE SYRIAN REGIME IT CLAIMS TO BE TARGETING ISLAMIST REBELS IN ALEPPO WHO ARE PART OF THE CEASEFIRE BUT SAYS MISTER CAREY IT'S ALSO HITTING REBELS WHO HAVE ACCEPTED THE TROOPS AS WELL AS CIVILIANS
HE'S CALLED ON THE RUSSIANS TO REIN IN THEIR ALLY BUT THESE ARE CREDIBLE OURS WILL LOOK FEROCIOUS CO OPERATION WE OBVIOUSLY LOOK FOR THE REGIME TO LISTEN
THE RESPONDENT COMMUNITIES POWERFUL STATEMENT TO THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL
MUST GO RECENTLY AGREED TO REVITALISE THE CEASEFIRE IN OTHER POCKETS OF THE COUNTRY AND AT THE WEEKEND SUGGESTED THAT MIGHT EXTEND TO ALEPPO OFFICIALS HERE WILL BE WRESTLING WITH THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT COULD WORK BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS WHETHER DAMASCUS AND MOSCOW ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS YOU WON'T HAVE TO PIECE OR USING IT TO GAIN MILITARY ADVANTAGE ON THE GROUND
THE GOVERNMENT IS BEGINNING A CONSULTATION OF PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE WAY RESTAURANTS TIP TREAT TIPPING MINISTERS WANT TO ENSURE THE PRACTICE IS MORE TRANSPARENT BUT CUSTOMERS NO TIPPING IS OPTIONAL BUT ALL OF THE TIP GOES TO STAFF THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAID YOU JAVID SAYS THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING
TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE FINDING THAT WHEN THEY'RE LEAVING TIPS FOR HARD WORKING PEOPLE THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO THOSE PEOPLE AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE IT'S GOT TO GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO TO IT'S GOT TO BE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS IT'S ALSO GOT TO BE VOLUNTARY FOR GOOD SERVICE THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION IF IT DOES MEAN LEGISLATION THEN WE WILL DO THAT I HOPE THERE'S SOME OTHER WAY BUT WE WILL TAKE ACTION IF THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED
HAVE BEEN ANGRY EXCHANGES ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DURING A TELEVISED DEBATE AHEAD OF THE HOLYROOD ELECTIONS ON THURSDAY THE ASSEMBLY'S NICOLA STURGEON SAID IF PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS NO POLITICIAN HAD THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THEIR WAY WITH THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID THE S.N.P. HAD PROMISED THE LAST REFERENDUM WOULD BE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT A SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLAME LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS
THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN FOUGHT ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES BUT THE IDEA OF A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM REMAINS A DEEP FAULT LINE IN SCOTTISH POLITICS
DURING THE FINAL T. V. DEBATE THE CONSERVATIVES RUTH DAVIDSON DESCRIBED IT AS AN OPEN WOUND THE S. AND P. WE DO NICOLA STURGEON DISAGREED SAYING THERE COULD BE ANOTHER SCOTTISH REFERENDUM IF THERE WAS CLEAR ON SUSTAINED EVIDENCE THAT INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND
THE SCOTTISH GREENS OFFERED BROAD SUPPORT BUT LABOUR'S KEZIA DUGDALE SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON AND THE SCOTTISH LIB DEM LEADER WILLIE RENNIE SAID CALLS FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM WERE ANTI DEMOCRATIC
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS FOR ENGLAND AND WALES HAS WARNED THAT CANNABIS SUBSTITUTE ARE HAVING A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON PRISONS PETER CLARKE SAYS THE USE OF SYNTHETIC CANNABIS ALSO KNOWN AS SPICE AND BLACK MAMBA HAS GIVEN RISE TO DET BULLYING AND VIOLENCE
A SMALL CONTINGENT OF BRITISH TROOPS HAS ARRIVED IN SOMALIA TO HELP THE U.N. MISSION THEIR TACKLE THE THREAT FROM ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THE OCHE ABOUT GROUP HAS BEEN ATTACKING SOMALI AND AFRICAN UNION FORCES DESPITE HAVING TO WITHDRAW FROM SEVERAL OF ITS STRONGHOLDS THE DETAILS FROM OUR DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BEALE
ABOUT TEN BRITISH TROOPS HAVE NOW ARRIVED IN SOMALIA TO SUPPORT THE AFRICAN UNION MISSION KNOWN AS ANNA SONG IT'S THE ADVANCE PARTY OF HER TEAM LITTLE EVENTUALLY TOTAL AROUND SEVENTY BRITISH MILITARY PERSON
THEY'LL BE PROVIDING MEDICAL LOGISTIC AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT IT'S NOT A COMBAT MISSION BUT WITH THE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUP AL SHABAB STILL A THREAT IN THE COUNTRY THERE WILL BE RISKS FOR THE BRITISH TROOPS INVOLVED
THIS DEPLOYMENT TO SOMALIA FOLLOWS A COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BRITISH TROOPS INVOLVED IN U.N. PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS AND TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO END SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DESTABILISING CONFLICTS
THE BODIES OF TWO AMERICAN CLIMBERS HAVE BEEN FOUND TRAPPED IN A GLACIER IN THE HIMALAYAS SIXTEEN YEARS AFTER THEY WERE KILLED BY AN AVALANCHE ALEX LOWE WHO WAS A LEADING MOUNTAINEER AND THE CAMERAMAN DAVID BRIDGES HAD BEEN CLIMBING SHISHI A BUN
AN AMERICAN CRUISE SHIP HAS SET SAIL FOR CUBA FROM THE U.S. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FORMER COLD WAR ENEMIES HAVE BEEN WARMING AND DIPLOMATIC TIES WERE RE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR OUR CORRESPONDENT WILL GROUND JOINED THE CELEBRATIONS ON BOARD THE SHIP WHICH IS DUE TO DOCK IN HAVANA LATER TODAY
WITH A SALSA BAND PLAYING ON DECK HE ADONI A SAILED OUT OF MY OWN
AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED PASSENGERS COCKTAILS IN THEIR HANDS THIS WAS A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE THEY ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO TRAVEL ON A U.S. PASSENGER SHIP TO CUBA SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION AND MANY SAID THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE MAKING HISTORY
BUT IT'S NOT BEEN AN ENTIRELY SIMPLE JOURNEY TO REACH THIS POINT THE U.S. CRUISE SHIP COMPANY CARNIVAL INITIALLY REFUSED TO SELL TICKETS TO CUBAN BORN NATIONALS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH A LONGSTANDING CUBAN MIGRATION LAW WHICH PROHIBITS THEM FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY BY SEA THAT UNSURPRISINGLY PROMPTED DEMONSTRATIONS AND THREATS OF LEGAL ACTION IN FLORIDA BUT THE RULE HAS NOW BEEN LIFTED IN A NUMBER OF CUBAN CALL NATIONALS ARE MAKING THE VOYAGE
I WAS WELL GRANT REPORTING THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TWO FACTS ABOUT TIPPING THE FIRST IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE A TIP IN A RESTAURANT OR CAFE EVEN IF IT'S BEEN ADDED TO YOUR BILL YOU CAN STRIKE IT OFF
BUT ALSO THE RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE ALL THE MONEY TO THE STAFF YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR THERE WAS QUITE A STINK ABOUT BIG COMPANIES HOLDING AT LEAST PART OF THE MONEY BACK ADMINISTRATION CHARGES ET-CETERA ANYWAY THIS CONFUSION MUST END ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT THEY HAVE A SET OF PROPOSALS OUT TODAY TO CLEAR UP CONFUSION ABOUT TIPPING CONWAY HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO WAITERS AND WAITRESSES AND INDEED TO MANAGERS IN CENTRAL LONDON
WHAT'S YOUR NAME BRUMMEL AYE WHAT DO YOU DO I RUN THE PLACE
DO THE TIPS TO MAKE YOUR STAFF WORK HARDER DO YOU THINK I THINK SO
HEAVEN SEE AMERICAN SCANDINAVIANS AND THE WORST TIPPERS I THINK CHINESE OR JAPANESE SO I THINK IT IS THE CHARGE AND IS A GOOD THING COS HE'S NOT IN THE CULTURE
COS I DON'T LIKE ITALIANS ISN'T AN OPTION THAT'S NOT AN OPTION
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING TIPS I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA BECAUSE HE'S MAKING ALL OF US TO BE MORE MY DIVVY
DO YOU DO ENTER TRIED TO DO A LOT OF BURSTS OF THE CUSTOMERS WHERE ARE YOU FROM
I MEAN YEAH DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO YOUR SERVICE TO GET
I THINK YOU GIVING A SERVICE BECAUSE YOU WANT
FROM THE
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR TIPS ON BETWEEN SLEEP AS A SERIOUS CHARGE
AND YOUR WEEKLY PASTE WE GET BE EVERY TWO WEEKS AND ALL THE TIPS DIVIDED UP BETWEEN YOU FAIRLY YEAH HOPE SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CUSTOMER LEAVES CASH
I THINK YOUR FIRST AND THEN WE KEEP IN A POCKET OF THE CLIFF THAT'S ALWAYS SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND ANOTHER
NOT EVERYBODY ALMOST GETS TO
AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE
AND THE PUBS SOMETIMES A WORK OF ART
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE STARS HOT SO YOU DON'T THINK THE TIPS MAKE YOU WORK HARDER NOW NEVER HAD TO HAVE A DREAM
CONWAY TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IN THE CENTRE OF LONDON THEY'RE AWFY IBRAHIM IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BRITISH HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS A LOT OF RESTAURANTS OTHER BUSINESSES WHERE TIPPING IS DONE AND SHE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT ABOUT THE THE GOVERNMENT'S NUCLEAR OPTION AS IT WERE SIMPLY SAYING YOU MAY NOT ADD TIPS TO BILL'S IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY WERE TO INTRODUCE THAT AND THEY'RE THREATENING THAT THAT'S AT LEAST ONE OF THE THINGS I CONSIDERING WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE
I THINK THAT CUSTOMERS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE A CUSTOM WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO
REWARD GREAT OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND I THINK FOR THE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM CUSTOMERS WOULD BE QUITE QUITE REMARKABLE IT WOULDN'T BE THERE WITH THE CUSTOMS CAN STILL NEED MONEY IF THEY WANT TO DO CASH TIPS AND SERVICE CHARGES THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YES ABSOLUTELY SO IF YOUR SUGGESTION IS THAT DISCRETIONARY SERVICE CHARGES ARE REMOVED FROM THE BILL
IN VIEW OF LEAVING HER CASH TIP THEN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE AS AN INDUSTRY WOULD NEED TO TO LOOK INTO AS THE GOVERNMENT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO IT THE IDEA THAT YOU TAKE IT OFF THE BILL COMPLETELY IT'S JUST A MATTER A TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THE WAITER OR WAITRESS AT THE END OF ME SO WE REPRESENT THE INDUSTRY AN ASM ASSOCIATION WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSIDER ALL OF THE PROPOSALS THAT GOVERNMENT HAS SET OUT IN THE CONSULTATION
TO ASSESS WHAT THE IMPACT COULD BE IMPACT ON BUSINESS THE IMPACT ON THE CUSTOMER AND THE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO THAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPACT WOULD BE
WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY NEED TO REVIEW THAT WE AS I SAY INTERESTINGLY YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE THERE AT THE OBVIOUS IMPACT FOR A BUSINESS THAT'S TAKING SOME OF THE MONEY IS THAT IT'S BAD FOR THEM BUT THE OBVIOUS IMPACT ONE WOULD ASSUME FOR A BUSINESS IS NOT ACTUALLY TAKING ANYTHING OUT OF THE TIPS WOULD BE ZERO REALLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE GET THE MONEY THEMSELVES
WELL I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING CLAIMS THAT'S RESTAURATEURS TAKE MONEY'S FOR THEMSELVES THAT'S NOT ACCURATE THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES AND INTERESTINGLY WHEN YOU SWIPE A CREDIT CARD IN A RESTAURANT THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY WILL MAKE A DEDUCTION AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT
OF THE TOTAL INCLUDING THE SERVICE CHARGE AND THAT THEREFORE HE'S NOT IN THE HANDS OF THE RESTAURANT THEMSELVES BUT THERE ARE SOME RESTAURANTS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN ACCUSED OF TAKING MORE THAN JUST ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES YOU'RE DOING THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN A DOZEN WITH YOUR MAN AND I'M ALSO SAYING IT'S VERY RISKY TO GENERALISE THAT THEY'RE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY
HAVE I JUST GETTING RID OF TIPS COMPLETELY NOT JUST THE TIPS THAT GO THROUGH THE BILL BUT ALSO THE WHOLE CULTURE OF TIPPING IF PEOPLE DO A GOOD JOB THEN THEY SHOULD BE PROPERLY PAID FOR DOING A GOOD JOB SO PERHAPS MAKE THE BILL THE ACTUAL BILL
FOR THE FOOD THAT YOU GET OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE BUYING HIGHER AND GET RID OF THE TIP TO SOME THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT
AS I SAID IT'S A CUSTOM IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S VERY STRANGE TO CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIES THAT ARE WHERE TIPPING IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED HAIRDRESSING RESTAURANTS AND OTHERS LIKE FIREMEN WHERE IT'S NOT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CULTURAL CHANGE WHICH MAY NOT BE THAT EASY BUT ONE THING THAT WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AS AN INDUSTRY AND CERTAINLY AS AN ASSOCIATION IS TRANSPARENCY
EMPOWER THE CUSTOMER TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO TIPS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE THEM ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE US A SERVICE CHARGE THAT THEY COULD OPT OUT OF THE CASH TIP IF THEY WISH TO YOU AND LET THEM KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING YES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT'S TALKING ABOUT ISN'T IT THAT ACTUALLY TOO MANY PEOPLE APPARENTLY DON'T KNOW THAT IF THERE IS A DISCRETIONARY SERVICE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PERM THEN IT'S OOH NO WHAT THE WORD DISCRETIONARY ME HUSBAND
I SUPPOSE IT'S TOO LONG A WORD BUT THAT'S A BIT BIGGER WARNING ACTUALLY ON A BILL QUITE SERIOUS POINT SAYING VERY IMPORTANT AS A CIGARETTE PACKETS TELLING ALL SORTS OF THINGS I SHOULD BE A WARNING ON BILLS YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THIS CHARGE WELL I MEAN IT IS VERY CLEARLY PRESENTED ON A BILL BY LAW YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A DISCRETIONARY SERVICE CHARGE SO THE INFORMATION IS THERE
BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO I THINK IS TO ENSURE THAT TRANSPARENCY IS COMPULSORY AND THAT THERE IS PERHAPS A MORE CONSISTENCY AROUND THE WAY IN WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THEY BECOME AKIN AND USED TO SEEING INFORMATION IN CERTAIN CERTAINLY THEN YOU EMPOWER THEM WITH AN ABILITY TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THE OTHER SUSPICION I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE OTHER ACCUSATIONS LEVELLED AT YOUR MEMBERS IS THAT
A LOT OF WAITRESSES AND WAITERS COULD NOT COPE WITHOUT THEIR MONEY THEY GET FROM TIPS THEY'RE NOT BEING PROPERLY PAID
WELL THAT IS A QUESTION THAT THAT WOULD
IMPLY THAT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY'RE BEING PAID IS LESS THAN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE AND THAT IS NOT CORRECT SO THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE COME ACROSS AS AN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING FORTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES
BUSINESSES ARE IN CONTRAVENTION OF PAYING PEOPLE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED BY BY LAW AND ABOVE THAT
PERHAPS GOING TO BE DID DO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WHEN THE CONSULTATION FINISHES YES THE TWENTY SEVENTH OF JUNE IS WHEN THE CONSULTATION CLOSES ON WE'RE GOING TO SEND EVERYONE CAN HAVE THEIR WHO FOR YOU BRILLIANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING THANK YOU SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOUR MOTHER IS IN HOSPITAL AT IS DESPERATELY ILL YOU WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST LIKE TO BE TOLD OF THE PEOPLE CARING FOR HER HAVE DECIDED SHE SHOULD NOT BE RESUSCITATED
BUT ACCORDING TO A SURVEY PUBLISHED TODAY IN A VAST NUMBER OF CASES AS MANY AS FORTY THOUSAND LOVED ONES ARE NOT TOLD WHEN AN ORDER IS IMPOSED I'M JOINED BY PROFESSOR MEZZO WHO CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE THAT PRODUCES THE REPORT HE'S PROFESSOR PRODUCE THIS REPORT HE'S PROFESSOR OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE AT SHEFFIELD UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
JUST IF YOU WOULD RUN US THROUGH THE PROCEDURE THAT HE HAS TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE ONE OF THESE D.N. OR NOTICES IS PUT AT THE END OF THE PATIENT'S BED
O.K. THANK YOU I REALLY WANT TO CLEAR UP ONE POINT ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCEDURE THAT IS D.N.A. ARE DO NOT ATTEMPT RESUSCITATION IS ABOUT A SPECIFIC MEDICAL INTERVENTION WHICH IS CARDIO PULMONARY RESUSCITATION
BASICALLY THAT MEANS ATTEMPTING TO GET THE HEART AND THE LUNGS WORKING AGAIN WE ONLY DO THIS IN MEDICINE WHEN WE THINK THAT THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE OF THE HEART AND LUNG STARTING A GAME SO FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY'S HAD AN ACUTE HEART ATTACK OR A BLOOD CLOT TO THE LUNGS ARE PARMALEE EMBOLISM
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING IN HOSPITAL AND NOT DYING OF SUDDEN HEART ATTACKS OR BLOOD CLOTS THERE DYING FOR INSTANCE FROM WITH CANCER WITH DEMENTIA WITH OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND THAT'S MEANT TO BE A PEACEFUL PASSING AWAY
IT WOULD BE QUITE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A DOCTOR A CRASH TEAM TO COME ALONG AND START POUNDING ON THE CHEST PUTTING TUBES IN WHEN ACTUALLY THE PERSON IS REACHING THE END OF THEIR LIFE AND NO AMOUNT OF RESUSCITATION IS GOING TO HELP
SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT D.A. NOW D.N.A. OUR DECISIONS ARE MADE WHEN IT'S THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY MAY HAVE AN ACUTE HEART ATTACK AND IT'S A GOOD CHANCE OF THEM RECOVERING THIS NO THERE'S NO SUGGESTION THAT ACTUALLY IF A DEAL OUR ORDERS MADE THEN THEY CAN'T HAVE OTHER
FORMS A TREATMENT FOR INSIST THEY COULD HAVE ANTIBIOTICS THEY COULD HAVE A DRIP THEY COULD HAVE PAIN RELIEF ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPEN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S A D.N.A. I DON'T TAKE YOUR POINT IT DID IT IS THAT SPECIFIC SPECIFIC PHYSICAL INTERVENTION ATTEMPT TO GET THE HEART AND LUNGS GOING AGAIN I I UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEY WILL
THE RULES SAY TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE STRICT RULES THE RULES SAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT YOU SHOULD DO THAT ONLY IF THE PATIENT CAN RECOVER AND GO ON TO LEAD A NORMAL WELL HOWEVER LONG BACK
PERSON MAY HAVE LEFT AND IT JOHN IN MEDICINE WE CANNOT WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN OF EVERYTHING SO IT'S ALL DOWN TO PROBABILITIES SOMETIMES DOCTORS AND NURSES HAVE TO MAKE QUICK DECISIONS IF THEY FEEL SOMEBODY IS SLIPPING AWAY AND THEY HAVE TO BE THEREFORE WAY UP IS THERE A GOOD CHANCE THAT THIS PERSON COULD COULD DIE SUDDENLY FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS RECOVERABLE RIGHT THE MAJORITY CASES IT'S NOT RIGHT BUT WITH THE POINT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND THIS IS
WHAT WILL UPSET MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY READ YOUR REPORT IS THAT THE CHILDREN THE LOVED ONES OF THE PERSON WHO IS LYING IN THAT HOSPITAL BED DO NOT KNOW THAT THAT NOTICE APPLIES TO THEM
NOW THIS IS A DUCK THIS IS A DIFFERENT STORY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CONFESS THAT ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT AS GOOD AS WE SHOULD BE IN FACT FOUR OUT OF FIVE SETS OF RELATIVES WERE INFORMED IN TIME BUT ONE OUT OF FIVE TWENTY PER CENT DIDN'T GET THAT IN A LARGE NUMBER FORTY IT IS IT IS A LARGE NUMBER WHEN YOU TRANSLATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BUT WE LOOKED AT THE REASONS WHY AND OFTEN IT'S BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FAMILY MEMBER A PERSON LIVING ALONE OR COME FROM THE CARE HOME OR BECAUSE STATE THEY TRY TO CONTACT THE PERSON BUT ONE UNABLE TO DO SO IN TIME THERE WOULD'VE BEEN CASES WHERE THEY SIMPLY DID NOT DO IT IS THAT'S THE CASE ISN'T IT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN BECAUSE DOCTORS ARE VERY BUSY AND NURSES THEY DON'T ALWAYS DOCUMENT THESE THINGS SO WE DON'T KNOW IN THE PROPORTION OF CASES WHY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT YOU'VE GOT THIS FIGURE OF FORTY THOUSAND
FORTY THOUSAND IS IF WE WE SURVEYED NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING IN ONE HUNDRED FORTY HOSPITAL TRUSTS FOR UP FOR OUR AUDIT IF YOU TRANSLATE THE RESULTS FROM THOSE NINE THOUSAND ACROSS THE COUNTRY YOU COULD YOU COULD REACH A FIGURE OF FORTY THOUSAND BUT AS I SAY THE MAJORITIES PEOPLE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ANY CHANCE OF IT BEING RESUSCITATED ANYWAY TO BE QUITE CLEAR YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE ARE MANY DOCTORS AND SENIOR NURSES OUT THERE
WHO ARE ACTING LIKE GOD IN SAYING WE HAVE DECIDED THERE THERE'S NO POINT IN TRYING TO SAVE THIS PATIENT'S LIFE SO THEREFORE WE WON'T DO IT WE WON'T TELL ANYBODY THAT IS NOT HAPPENING YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN I WHEN I QUALIFIED THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT WAS HAPPENING I'VE NO DOUBT I'VE BEEN A CONSULTANT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I'VE SEEN A MASSIVE SHIFT IN EMPHASIS WE DON'T MAKE THOSE GODLIKE DECISIONS ANY MORE DECISIONS ARE MOSTLY MADE WITH THE TEAM HE SAID A DOCTOR AND A NURSE WORKING YOU WORKING TOGETHER
AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE WE CONVEY THAT TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS WE DO TRY TO ALSO CAN DISCUSS THAT WITH HER FAMILY IN OUR AUDIT ONE THIRD OF PATIENTS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY HAD THAT INFORMATION BUT IN TWO THIRDS THEY WERE THEY WERE TOO ILL TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION PROFESSOR MEDS MEDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND HERE'S A GOOD JOB YOU COULD BECOME A STOREROOM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND WHAT FUN WELL
YOU CAN'T WAIT NO SIR GOOD NOW IT'S TOO LATE TO PEOPLE HAVE GOT THE JOB ALREADY HE'S TANYA YOU'RE OVERQUALIFIED JUST
YES FROM TODAY PROFESSOR HOWARD JAMES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND AT ISH REX GO SHOE IS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE I.M.F. RESEARCH DEPARTMENT WILL START TO WRITE ABOUT THE FONZ OFFICIAL HISTORY DO WE NEED TO KNOW THIS YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF THERE WRITING FROM THE PERIOD FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE OF COURSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS HAPPENED
THEY'RE GOING TO WRITE ABOUT DEFINING MOMENTS GENERALLY IN THE FUN'S HISTORY BUT THAT IS THE FOCUS FOR THAT PERIOD SO I CAUGHT UP WITH ONE OF THEM PROFESSOR HOWARD JAMES AND ASKED HIM WHAT CLUES HE WAS NOW LOOKING FOR IN THE LEAD UP TO THAT MOMENT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE HISTORY OF GLOBALISATION GLOBAL CO OPERATION WORKS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT IS VERY EVIDENT AS THE GLOBAL CO OPERATION INTEGRATION IS VERY MUCH MORE FRAGILE NOW THE REACTION TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS
I THINK PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF NATIONAL SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN CO OPERATIVE ONES AND VERY OFTEN THOSE NATIONAL SOLUTIONS TEND TO BE AS THERE ARE SOME GOOD THAT CAN BE REALLY DESTRUCTIVE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ZERO SUM GAIN IN THIS CONTEXT ONE COUNTRY
THINKS IT NEEDS TO PROTECT ITSELF AND THE WAY THAT IT PROTECTS ITSELF IS ACTUALLY HATCHING OTHER COUNTRIES SO INSTEAD OF THINKING OF HER CAKE THAT'S CONTINUALLY GROWING PEOPLE THINK OF QUARRELLING ABOUT SLICES OF THE CAKE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE PROBLEM ALL WHAT LED TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BUT OUR RESPONSE TO IT IS
ALMOST MORE SO THAT'S IT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS PEOPLE KNOCK A BANKING SYSTEMS FOR INSTANCE AND THINK WELL THEY NEED PRIMARILY TO SERVE THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO CUT OUT THE INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS
INTERNATIONAL TYRES WHAT EXAMPLES YOU HAVE OF WHERE COUNTRIES HAVE TURNED IN ON THEMSELVES IN THIS WAY AND SOUGHT TO PROTECT THEIR SOVEREIGNTY OR THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR OWN ECONOMIES THERE'S BEEN SURPRISINGLY LITTLE BIT OF THIS IN THE TRADE THROUGH
IT'S A CONTINUAL THEME OF DISCUSSIONS THAT'S A BIG THEME OBVIOUSLY A PRIMARY CAMPAIGN FOR A U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS MEANT IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION WAS MUCH MORE OF IT
AND IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LIMIT MIGRATION THAT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO LET AT MIGRATION BUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT OPENING OUR BORDERS TO TRADE AND MIGRATION SO ON IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A GOOD THING IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE ECONOMIC GREY INEVITABLY ARE PRODUCERS
BEGONIAS BUT IT ALSO CAN PRODUCE LOSSES AND THE DELICATE ACTOR OF GLOBALISATION HAS ALWAYS THAT SERIOUSLY CONSISTED OF TRYING TO WORK OUT WAYS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE WHO LOSE VERY IMMEDIATELY INTO A VULNERABLE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR GROUP WANT HAVITOL MARKET INTEGRATION HOW THEY CAN BE COMPENSATED WE ARE STARTING TO SEE ECONOMIES GROWING AGAIN IN SOME CASES QUITE SOLIDLY BUT IT'S A BIT FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND OF COURSE UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS A BIG CONCERN BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LASTING
LEGACY OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WILL BE IN MAY WELL BE BUT WE'RE REALLY HEADING INTO A PYRAMID AND RICH THERE'S MUCH SLOWER GROWTH
SLOWER GROWTH THE RECOVERY THAT SHE WAS VERY SPORADIC AND PATCHY AT THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO BE THE NEW NORMAL SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT SECULAR STAGNATION MAYBE SECULAR STAGNATION IS OVERDONE BUT THE NEW NORMAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE KIND OF GROWTH RATES THAT WE HAD AND THE PARENTS IN THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY
PROFESSOR HOW JAMES OFFICIAL HISTORIAN OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TURN TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DOMINATED THE FINAL TELEVISED DEBATE IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOR THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT LAST NIGHT THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON AND THE GREENS LEADER PATRICK HARVIE ARGUED THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM IF ENOUGH PEOPLE WANT ONE BUT THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER THREE PARTY SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON ASK ROBIN CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLAME ISN'T THE ARGUMENTS
THE FIVE PARTY LEADERS FACED QUESTIONS ON THE HEALTH SERVICE JOBS UNDER DISRUPTION TO EDINBURGH SCHOOLS BUT IT WAS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM WHICH IGNITED THE DEBATE
THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON AT ALL THE SUNDAY NEWSPAPER SHE WAS CONFIDENT THERE'D BE ONE WELL SHE WAS FIRST MINISTER SHIT ALL THE T.V. AUDIENCE PEOPLE WHO HAD VOTED AGAINST INDEPENDENCE HAD THE RIGHT TO RECONSIDER
IF PEOPLE DO CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND LET HIS CLEARANCE ESTEEMED EVIDENCE BUT INDEPENDENCE HAS BECOME THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND THEN TO ANSWER THE QUESTION NO POLITICIAN HAS THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE DEMOCRATIC WISHES
THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID NICOLA STURGEON HAD MISLED THE PUBLIC DURING THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
SHE WENT ROUND EVERY T.V. STUDIO SHE COULD FIND AND LOOK DOWN THE CAMERA LENS AND TOLD EVERY PERSON IN SCOTLAND IT WAS ONCE A GENERATION ONCE IN A LIFETIME SHE'S GONE BACK ON BOTH OF THOSE PROMISES IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND IT'S NOT HARD UP TO HORROR TO SEE ONE OPINION POOR SHE LIGHT AND SEE QUICK THIS COUNTRY THROUGH ALL ONCE MORE
LABOUR'S KEZIA DUGDALE SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON SHE SAID IT WASN'T NECESSARY FOR SCOTLAND TO BE INDEPENDENT FOR REAL CHANGE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
THE GREATEST MYTH OF THE REFERENDUM WAS THAT INDEPENDENCE WAS THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THANKS AND I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THE NEW PARISH THEY ARE COMING TO THE PARLIAMENT WHICH ALLOW THIS TO TAX THE RICH SO WE CAN INVEST MORE IN OUR SCHOOLS SO WE CAN STOP THE CUTS TO PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE N.H.S. ARE LOWEST TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES FROM THE ONES THAT WE'VE HAD FROM THE TORIES DOWN SOUTH KEZIA DUGDALE WAS PRESSED ON A POLICY ON TRIDENT
NICOLA STURGEON TOLD THE CONSERVATIVES RUTH DAVIDSON ANY DELAY TO CONTRACTS TO BUILD ROYAL NAVY FRIGATES ON THE CLYDE WAS A BETRAYAL
PATRICK HARVIE OF THE SCOTTISH GREENS SAID THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT COULD INVEST IN REAL IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION IF THE POLITICAL WILL WAS THERE
WITH EVERY BET CAPABLE OF DOING SO IF WE ENSURE THAT THE NEXT SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IS UNDER PRESSURE TO LEVY PROGRESSIVE TAXATION AND MAKE THAT CASE FOR RAISING REVENUE FROM THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR OUR VITAL PUBLIC SERVICES
FOR THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WILLIE RENNIE FELT A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE HEALTH SERVICE HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
AT THE CORE OF THE WE NEED TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT ALL LEVELS WE NEED TO TRAIN WITH IT HERE SO WE CAN GET THAT EVERY TREATMENT WITH PEOPLE NEED IT MOST READ IT TO HAVE AN IN WITH THE POLICE AS WELL
SO THAT WHEN THE POLICE HAVE GONE ROUND A COMING ACROSS MANY CRISIS SITUATIONS THEY CAN GIVE IMMEDIATE HELP AT THAT POINT ACCIDENT THE MATTRESSES EXTRA SUPPORT IS ESSENTIAL TO
THIS WAS NOT A DEBATE WORM KNOCKOUT BLOWS WERE LANDED WITH THREE DAYS TO GO UNTIL THE POLLS OPEN SCOTLAND'S POLITICAL PARTIES ALL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT AMBITIONS FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T BEEN WATCHING THE SCOTTISH OPINION POLLS THERE WAS ONE SIGNIFICANT INDICATOR
DURING A DEBATE ONLY THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON SPOKE OF WINNING AND BECOMING FIRST MINISTER

RESTAURANTS COULD BE STOPPED FROM ADDING SERVICE CHARGES TO THE BILL AND A NEW PROPOSALS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT MINISTERS WANT CUSTOMERS TO KNOW THAT TIPPING IS OPTIONAL AND ENSURE THAT STAFF RECEIVE ANY MONEY GIVEN THEY SAY THEY'LL INTRODUCE LEGISLATION IF NECESSARY
THERE HAVE BEEN HEATED EXCHANGES ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DURING A TELEVISED DEBATE AHEAD OF THE HOLYROOD ELECTIONS ON THURSDAY IS M.P.S NICOLA STURGEON SAID IF PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS NO POLITICIAN HAD THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THEIR WAY BUT THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID THE S.N.P. HAD PROMISED THE LAST REFERENDUM WOULD BE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT
A SMALL TEAM OF BRITISH SOLDIERS HAS ARRIVED IN SOMALIA AS PART OF A UNITED NATIONS MISSION TO COUNTER ISLAMIST MILITANTS THEIR NUMBER WILL EVENTUALLY REACH ABOUT SEVENTY MADE UP OF MEDICAL LOGISTICAL AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL
AN AMERICAN CRUISE SHIP HAS SET SAIL FOR CUBA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS THE ADONI A LEFT MIAMI WITH AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED PASSENGERS ON BOARD AND IS DUE TO ARRIVE IN HAVANA TODAY CUBA AND THE U.S. RESTORED TO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS LAST YEAR
TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT FIVE YEARS SINCE CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT IN SYRIA AND EVERY YEAR WE SAY SURELY IT CAN'T GET MUCH WORSE AND EVERY YEAR IT DOES IT IS BY A VERY LONG WAY THE GREATEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF THE CENTURY
THERE WAS A RAY OF HOPE WHEN MOST OF THE WARNING PARTIES AGREED TO SOME FORM OF LIMITED CEASEFIRE IN FEBRUARY BUT EVEN THAT SEEMS TO BE CRUMBLY THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY'S GOING TO GENEVA WHERE THE PEACE TALKS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING TO TRIED TO SHORE THEM UP BUT EVEN AS THEY TALK THE SUFFERING FOR MANY GROWS
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO TOM FLETCHER WHO WAS A BRITISH AMBASSADOR IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN WHO SPENDING THIS WEEK GOING TO REFUGEE CAMPS HOUSING SOME OF THE MANY MILLIONS OF SYRIANS WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES FROM THEIR HOME COUNTRY AND I ASKED HIM WHAT HE'S HOPING TO ACHIEVE
FIRSTLY I WANT TO GET BACK THERE AND HEAR FROM THE REFUGEES THEMSELVES HOW THEY'RE COPING WITH THE SITUATION AND TO TO TELL THEM THERE ARE MANY OF US OUT HERE STILL ROOTING FOR THEM STILL DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HELP THEM BUT MORE PRACTICALLY I'M TAKING A GROUP OF BUSINESS LEADERS FROM THE STATES FROM EUROPE FROM THE REGION TO SEE HOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN HELP GOVERNMENTS AND DONORS AND OTHERS GET ONE MILLION KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL
BIG JOB WELL IT'S TOUGH BUT YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT THESE KIDS WON'T HAVE A CHOICE BEYOND THE BARREL BOMBS OF ASAD ON THE BOX OFFICE
BARBARITY OF ICE SO ALL THE PERILS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN ROCKY THIS IS COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE DEALING WITH AT THE MOMENT GETTING THESE KIDS INTO SCHOOL AND GETTING SECURITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO THIS REGION IS IS A FIRST ORDER PRIORITY WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR DO THEN THAT GOVERNMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DUDE ARE YOU HOPING THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY BUILD SCHOOLS PHYSICAL SCHOOLS OR GET TEACHERS OUT THERE A LOT
WELL YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT TRYING TO BE WHAT WE WHAT WE'RE DISCOVERING IS THAT EVEN WITH ALL THE GOODWILL FROM GOVERNMENTS IN THE U.K. PRESIDENT FANTASTIC SUMMIT IN FEBRUARY THAT RAISED A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT STILL WON'T BE ENOUGH TO GET THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN HELP THEY CAN BUILD THE SCORES THEY CAN HELP PROVIDE THE TRANSPORT THAT GETS THE KIDS TO SCHOOL THEY CAN HELP THE CONNECTIVITY
GETTING WHY FIND TO THESE AREAS SO THAT WE CAN THEN GET THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT ONTO KIDS DEVICES ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW THOSE RUSHES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN HELP US CRACK I PERSONALLY THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY IS A HUGE PART OF THIS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AREAS WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING OUR LIVES I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS INCREDIBLY SMART PEOPLE CAN'T ALSO GET EDUCATION TO ONE MILLION SYRIANS
WHAT THEY CAN'T DO OF COURSE WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN'T DO IS BRING PEACE AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST PRIZE ISN'T IT AND WE'RE SEEING AT THE MOMENT THE CEASEFIRE SUCH AS IT WAS COLLAPSING WHO DO YOU BLAME FOR THAT WELL IT'S RELATES THE GRIM I'M AFRAID AND WE'VE BE REMINDED AGAIN
THIS WEEK IN ALEPPO THAT THE ASSET KILLING MACHINE HAS NO PAUSE BUTTON INDUSTRIAL TERROR IS BASICALLY IT'S FACTORY SETTING THAT'S HOW IT SURVIVED THROUGH THAT BRUTALITY AND ALEPPO IT'S JUST SO HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE YOU IMAGINE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO CONTINUES OPERATED PEOPLE BOMBS ARE FALLING IMAGINE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO RUNS BACK UNDER THOSE BOMBS TO PROTECT CIVILIANS AND THEN IMAGINE THE KIND OF LEADER OF THE KIND OF PERSON WHO DELIBERATELY TARGETS
YOU KNOW IT'S BREAKING THE MOST SIMPLE BASIC RULE OF WATER YOU DON'T KILL THE CIVILIANS YOU DON'T KILL THE DOCTORS AND SO I MEAN MY QUESTION READY FOR FOR MOSCOW ACTUALLY IS
YOU KNOW THIS PLAN IS BUILT ON YOUR ABILITY TO RESTRAIN YOUR FRIEND YOUR ALLY YOUR CLIENT IN DAMASCUS
SO WAS HE BOMBING CIVILIANS BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO OR IS HE BOMBING OR BECAUSE HE'S NOT LISTENING TO YOU YOU KNOW HOW MANY CALLS HIS PUTIN MADE TO US THAT SINCE THE BOMBING OF FALCONS HOSPITAL LAST WEEK TO TELL HIM TO REIN IT IN
WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT SUMMAT THAT BRUTAL THOUGH ALL OF THIS IS BETTER TO HAVE HIM A PRESIDENT LIKE HIM
IN SYRIA THAN ISIS LOOK AT ME OUT IS THAT IT IS NOW PART OF THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN SYRIA BUT HE'S NOT
PART OF THE ANSWER YOU CAN'T RE ESTABLISH AUTHORITY OVER A CASTLE OVER A COUNTRY WHEN YOU'VE USED BOMBED A HALF ITS POPULATION AND YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN SAY WHERE'S THE ALTERNATIVE BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BOGUS WE NEED TO LET THE SYRIAN PEOPLE CHOOSE THE ALTERNATIVE WHEN
WHEN RUSSIA AND OTHERS WERE SURROUND IN BERLIN IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE NO ONE WAS SAYING LET'S LEAVE IT THERE IN POWER BECAUSE ADMIRAL DOENITZ THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE TWO WEEK TOM FLETCHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE PAPERS WHICH ARE ONCE AGAIN DOMINATED BY THE ANTI CEMETERIES AND ROW GRIPPING LABOUR MCCLUSKY ATTACKS TREACHEROUS LABOUR M.P.S A HEADLINE FOR THE GUARDIAN BELIEVES AHEAD OF THE UNITE UNION AS ESCALATED THE RABBI NAMING THOSE ACCUSED OF TRYING TO UNDERMINE JEREMY CORBIN WAS ALSO COWS ARE RESULTS OF A POLL SUGGESTING LABOURS ON COURSE TO LOSE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE COUNCIL SEATS ON THURSDAY
TIMES WHICH SAYS MY COOGAN FACES A FRONT BENCH EXODUS BELIEVES LABOUR FACES A STIFF ELECTORAL TEST UNDER CALAMITOUS LEADER DESERVES TO BE HEAVILY DEFEATED THE STAR LABELS MY RED MAN WALKING SAYING INSIDE AS BILLY HEAVY OFFICE LOSSES WILL TRIGGER A COUP BY WHAT IT CALLS A LABOUR HEAVYWEIGHTS SCHOOL'S OUT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT'S THE LEAD HEADLINE FOR THE NEW DAY AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S PLANNED PROTESTS AGAINST NEW SATS
TESTS IN ENGLAND SO THE EDUCATION SECRETARY NICKY MORGAN HAS INFURIATED WHAT HE CALLS THE GRASSROOTS PARENT POWER ORGANISERS BY CLAIMING THEY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS CHILDREN AGED SIX SINCE SCHOOL STRIKES AS THEIR LAMP THE MIRROR SO HIS WORK FOR THE EXAMS HE'S LEAVING THEM STRESSED AND FEARING FAILURE FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE MAIN STORIES A CRACKDOWN ON HIGH EXECUTIVE SALARIES WHICH IT SAYS COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT MOST LISTED COMPANIES IT SAYS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST SOVEREIGN WELL FUN IT'S NORWAY
EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR OIL FUN IS ATTEMPTING TO EXERT ITS INFLUENCE ACCORDING TO PAPER AT OWNS ON AVERAGE ONE POINT THREE PER CENT OF ALMOST EVERY LISTED COMPANY IN THE WORLD A CERTAIN FOOTBALL MATCHES THE BIG STORY OF COURSE LESTER'S FAIRYTALE ENDING GOES INTO EXTRA TIME IS THE GUARDIAN'S HEADLINE THEY MAY HAVE TO WAIT A DAY A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT BUT THERE'S AN UNWAVERING SENSE OF OPTIMISM ON THE CITY'S STREETS THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES
WHEN DICTATORSHIPS AND IN POWER ONE OF THE WAYS THEY TRIED TO SECURE THEIR PLACE IN HISTORY IS BY CREATING PHYSICAL REMINDERS OF THAT POWER I THINK THOSE HIDEOUS CONCRETE TOWER BLOCKS AROUND IN MOSCOW DURING THE BRUTAL YEARS OF STALIN WELL THE NAZIS DID THE SAME DURING THEIR YEARS IN POWER FROM NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND COLIN PHILPOTTS BEEN WRITING A BOOK ABOUT IT RELICS OF THE RIGHT GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING JOHN AND IT WAS ABOUT AS TOWER BLOCKS WAS IT IT WAS THINGS LIKE STADIUM HOLIDAY CAMPS FOR WELL FOR THEMSELVES FOR THE NAZIS FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE
INDEED I MEAN I THINK WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT NAZI BUILDINGS THEY OFTEN THINK FIRST OF COURSE OF THE TERROR MACHINE OF THE NUANCES THAT THINK ABOUT CONCENTRATION CAMPS EXTERMINATION CAMPS AND THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE
BEST ESTIMATES WHAT REALLY DID FIFTEEN THOUSAND BUT OBVIOUSLY MUCH SMALLER CONCENTRATE AND I'D NONE OF THEM NOT ALL IN GERMANY OF COURSE NOT I'M GOING TO DO IN OTHER PLACES BUT MANY OF THOSE OF COURSE WERE DESTROYED MANY OF THEM DESTROYED BY THE NAZIS THEMSELVES OF COURSE BUT PROBABLY SEVENTY OR SO OF THOSE STILL REMAIN OF COURSE MOST OF THOSE HAVE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF TIME HAVE BEEN MADE INTO MEMORIALS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER
THEN THERE ARE THE RELICS OF THE NAZI WAR MACHINE BUNKERS COMMAND POSTS ROCKET LAUNCH SITES EXCEPT FROM ACTUALLY THIS TALKING ABOUT MANY OF THOSE IS THAT THEY WERE SO WELL BUILT THAT ATTEMPTS TO GET RID OF THEM OFTEN FAILED SO WE NOW HAVE
FLAK TOWERS THAT ARE NIGHTCLUBS OR AQUARIUMS OR EVEN A BIOMASS ENERGY PLANT IN ONE CASE BUT I SUPPOSE THE MOST FASCINATING GROUP ARE THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS THE CIVIC BUILDINGS THAT WERE PUT UP BY THE NAZIS THINGS LIKE THE NUREMBERG RALLY GROUNDS THE BERLIN OLYMPIC STADIUM YOU MENTIONED A HOLIDAY CAMP THE STRENGTH THROUGH JOY PRIOR RUGEN HOLIDAY CAMP ON THE ON THE BALTIC COAST MOTORWAY NETWORK
IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION I THINK OF PRAGMATISM
POLITICS AND SYMBOLISM WHICH HAVE DETERMINED WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE BUILDING SOME OF THEM REMAIN SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE QUITE USEFUL BUILDINGS BUT SOME EVEN BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY RATHER GOOD BUILDINGS SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THERE'S NO SORT OF SENSE OF UNEASE I SUPPOSE IS PERHAPS HOUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY AND THE OTHER LET ME JUST GIVE ME TWO CURRENT EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE UNEASY STILL MANIFESTING ITSELF IN THE NAZI RALLY AT THE NUREMBERG RALLY GROUNDS PROBABLY THE MOST ICONIC NAZI BUILT THIS VAST AREA ON THE SOUTH EAST SIDE OF NUREMBERG
WHETHER PARTY RALLIES TOOK PLACE FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE AMERICAN MILITARY USE IT WAS USED AS A RACETRACK BILLY GRAHAM EVEN HAD A RALLY THERE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BUT THE BUILDINGS WERE EVENTUALLY LISTED THE EQUIVALENT OF LISTED STATUS
A MUSEUM WAS OPENED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE BUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR GO THERE BUT NOW THESE BUILDINGS BUILT AND DESIGNED BY ALBERT SPEER WHO SAID THEY WOULD LAST FOR A THOUSAND YEARS ARE ACTUALLY STARTING TO CRUMBLE AFTER ABOUT EIGHTY YEARS AND NUREMBERG HAS DECIDED IN PRINCIPLE DESPITE SOME VOICES BEING RAISED AGAINST IT IT IS WORTH SPENDING ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION EUROS
TO STOP THEM FALLING DOWN AND I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT ON THE BASIS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT AS PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS
EXPLAINING TO PEOPLE HOW TERRIBLE THIS REGIME WAS THAT PLACES LIKE THIS ARE PRESERVED THEM OFF MY EXPENSIVE GOING TO PLACES LIKE OTHERS IS ACTUALLY THE GERMANS DO THIS QUITE WELL STUN OBJECTIVELY THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT AWAY OF GLORY SO I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING BUT GOING TO A HOLIDAY CAMP FOR INSTANCE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME KNOWING
WHO IT WAS BUILT BY AND WHY ONLY THAT IT WENT IN AT THE VERY LEAST AND THAT ENDED THE PRIOR ROBIN HOLIDAY CAMP ON THE BALTIC COAST IS EVEN AS WE SPEAK BEING TURNED INTO LUXURY HOLIDAY APARTMENTS AND NOBODY EVER EVER HAD A HOLIDAY THERE
UNDER HITLER BUT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A HOLIDAY THEN IT IS THERE IS UNEASE IN THERE IS DISPUTE ABOUT IT BUT I THINK YOU TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE BERLIN OLYMPIC STADIUM AND OF COURSE THAT WAS BUILT ABSOLUTELY AS PART OF THE NAZI PROPAGANDA
MACHINE BUT IN A WAY I THINK BUILDINGS LIKE THAT HAVE SORT OF OUT LIVE THEIR NAZI PROVENANCE ANYWAY AND THE FACT THAT JESSE OWENS ACTUALLY CAN FAT HUNTED A LOT OF HITLER'S THEORIES THERE AND LOTS OF THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THERE SINCE SO THAT I THINK ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE RATHER A SORT OF WANTON ACT OF DESTRUCTION TO HAVE GOT RID OF BUILDINGS LIKE THAT OF THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERROR ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS MANY OF THEM ARE QUITE RIGHTLY PRESERVED COLIN PHILPOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER IN OUR STUDIO HERE THIS MORNING IS THE REFEREE DOCTOR JANE LEECHES THE PRINCIPLE OF WESTERLY HOUSE THE METHODIST COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE MORNING GOOD MORNING
MANY OF US TODAY IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO A CONTRACT OF WORK THAT GIVES US THE BANK HOLIDAYS WILL BE HOPING FOR GOOD WEATHER AND THE CHANCE TO RELAX IF NOT LIKE ME YOU MAY BE SETTING OFF FOR WORK FEELING THAT YOUR PERHAPS MISSING OUT ON AN ANCIENT ENTITLEMENT
A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT MAY BE MISPLACED HOWEVER FOR THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE ACT OF PARLIAMENT THAT FIRST INTRODUCED BANK HOLIDAYS TO THE U.K. WAS NOT SO MUCH MOTIVATED BY GIVING WORKERS TIME OFF AS ENSURING THAT THE MODERNISING ECONOMY WAS KEPT MOVING BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DAYS ON WHICH THE BANK OF ENGLAND COULD CLOSE FROM OVER THIRTY TO JUST HALF A DOZEN MAY DAY NOT BEING ADDED UNTIL OVER A CENTURY LATER
INTERNATIONALLY THOUGH FROM THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES MAYDAY HAD BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH WORKERS' RIGHTS THROUGH THE COMMEMORATION OF THE HAYMARKET RIOTING CHICAGO DURING WHICH SEVERAL PEOPLE DIED AS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO LIMIT WORKING HOURS TO WEIGH TODAY
SINCE THEN MAY DAY HAS BEEN MARKED IN LONDON BY THE TRADES UNION MOVEMENT AND YESTERDAY'S SAW SUCH A BALLY AGAIN IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE
THE HISTORY OF OUR MAY DAY BANK HOLIDAY IN THE U.K. THEN ENSHRINED SOMETHING OF THE TENSION BETWEEN THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL ECONOMY TO BE PRODUCTIVE IT IF IT IS TO GENERATE THE WEALTH TO MEET ITS PEOPLE'S NEEDS AND THE NEEDS OF THOSE PEOPLE FOR APPROPRIATE REST
THE NEED FOR A BALANCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORK AND REST IS A KEY THEME IN BOTH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES EXPRESSED MOST ICONICALLY IN THE NATION THAT EVEN GOD WORKED ONLY SIX DAYS TO CREATE THE WORLD AND RESTED ON THE SEVENTH
REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY AND KEEP IT HOLY IS THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT
THE SABBATH IS NOT ONLY INTENDED AS A DAY OF REST FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT FOR THE COMMANDMENTS MAKE IT INCUMBENT ON THE LEADERS OF HOUSEHOLDS TO FEED AND SHELTER THEIR WORKERS AND ANIMALS NO LESS ON THIS UNPRODUCTIVE DAY THAN ON THE OTHER SIX
SO FAR THIS MAY ONLY SEEM COMMON SENSE MOST OF US HAVE PROBABLY EXPERIENCED THAT WORKING ALL THE HOURS THERE ARE AFFECTS OUR CONCENTRATION AND MOTIVATION AND EVENTUALLY OUR HEALTH
YET AS JESUS REMINDED THOSE WHO CRITICISED HIM FOR FEEDING HIS DISCIPLES ON THE SABBATH THE SABBATH WAS MADE FOR HUMAN BEINGS AND NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND HUMAN BEINGS ARE COMMANDED BY GOD TO REST NOT ONLY IN ORDER TO BE FIT ENOUGH TO SERVE THE ECONOMY BETTER
BUT IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE OUR VALUE AS BELOVED CREATURES WHOSE LIFE IS TO BE ENJOYED AS ONE AND GIVE
TO ME THESE COMMANDMENTS ARE A CAUTION IT'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SHOULD BE AT THE SERVICE OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO SEDUCE US INTO BEING AN END IN ITSELF
A REMINDER THAT THE GENERATION OF WEALTH WHILE IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY SHOULD BE AT THE SERVICE OF MEETING EVERYONE'S NEEDS
AND A STIMULUS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PATTERNS OF LABOUR ALLOW EVERYONE THE CHANCE TO REST AND ENJOY PERHAPS TODAY WITH THE PEOPLE OF LEICESTER THE GIFT OF THE LIFE THAT IS IN US
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR JANE LEACH THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT NOT JUST ONE COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE BUT TO WORK AND PENSIONS BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SKILLS WANT TO HEAR FROM THE FORMER OWNER OF B.H.S. HAVE PHILIP GREEN THEY'VE INVITED HIM TO A JOINT SESSION ON A DAY OF HIS CHOOSING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE QUITE AN EVENT AND WE'LL TALK TO THE CHAIR OF ONE OF THOSE COMMITTEES AND JUST A SECOND BUT AS WELL AS THE FIREWORKS ON BOTH SIDES ONE SUSPECTS THERE WILL BE A SERIOUS DETAILED QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED
PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE PENSION DISASTER AND B.H.S. A DISASTER THAT OTHER PENSION SCHEMES ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO HELP SORT OUT FOR INSTANCE WHY WAS SO MUCH MONEY PAID OUT INTO EVIDENCE FROM THE COMPANY WHEN SIR PHILIP OWNED IT EVEN THOUGH THE PENSION FUND WAS IN TROUBLE AND WHY IN TWENTY TWELVE WAS A DEAL DONE TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT
IN THE PENSION FUND THAT CENTRE AND I'VE QUITE A RELAXED TIMETABLE FOR SORTING IT OUT LET'S TALK FIRST OR CHRISTINE FURNISHES CHAIR OF THE PEER TO PEER FINANCE ASSOCIATION AND A FORMER C.E.O. OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PENSION FUNDS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING ON THERE
PENSION THE LONG TERM PROBLEMS THAT THE PENSION FUND WAS FACING AT WHAT STAGE DO YOU THINK AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMEONE ACTUALLY SAYING HANG ON ARE SAYING THE SOMETHING GOING WRONG WELL
THE TRUSTEES WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHEME WAS PROPERLY FUNDED THAT'S THEIR CORE JOB AND THE TRUSTEES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED AND INDEPENDENT OF THE SPONSORING EMPLOYER IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY DO THAT JOB VERY CAREFULLY BUT THE TRUSTEES ARE ALWAYS ADVISED BY A STEAM A SCHEME ACTUALLY IN THE SCHEME ACTUALLY HAS QUITE A POWERFUL ROLE
IN TRUST BASED PENSION SCHEMES BECAUSE IT'S THE TRICK SCHEME ACTUALLY WHO ACTUALLY DOES THE VALUATION AND TELLS THE TRUSTEES WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IN THE SCHEME WOULD ACTUALLY MEET ALL THE BENEFITS THE SCHEME ACTUARY HAVE INTERVENED WHEN THE DIVIDENDS WERE BEING PAID OUT HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY BEING PAID OUT AND EVIDENCE AND SAID HANG ON A SECOND SAID TO THE COMPANY OR SAID PUBLICLY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
THE SCHEME HATCHERIES JOB IS TO ADVISE THE TRUSTEES AND THEIR TRIPS TRUSTEES THEN HAVE TO AGREE HAVE A SCHEME IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED AND THEY NEGOTIATE A RECOVERY PLAN LOUISE SHEDDING LAWYER SORRY SHOULD THEY HAVE GONE TO SOME FELLA
THEY SHOULD HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH THE EMPLOYER ABSOLUTELY TOOT TO ENSURE THAT MORE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE PAID IN AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME IN ORDER TO SECURE THOSE BENEFITS AND WHEN THEY SAW MONEY LEAVING THE COMPANY AND EVIDENCE THEY COULD HAVE SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR VIEW INTERVENED AND SAID STOP
WELL THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT THE ACTORY WILL DO A FULL VALUATION EVERY THREE YEARS IT'S A VERY BIG AND SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THE ACTUARY MAKES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WHETHER ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE INVESTMENTS HOW LONG SKI MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO LIVE ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE VERY SENSITIVE
THE ACTUARY WILL EITHER COME UP WITH A SURPLUS OR A DEFICIT I THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO THE EARLY NOUGHTIES ACTUALLY AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THIS SCHEME AND PARTICULARLY TRACK THE PERIOD FROM TWO THOUSAND FOR WHEN REGULATION TIGHTENED UP AND WHEN TRUSTEES AND SCHEME ACTUARIES WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE VERY PRUDENT WITH THEIR ASSUMPTIONS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS THAT VALUATION AND THE RECOVERY PLAN IF THERE'S A DEFICIT
GOES IN TO THEIR PENSIONS REGULATOR AND THE PENSIONS REGULATOR HAS SOME REAL STRONG POWERS TO INTERVENE IF THEY THINK IT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT YES THEY WERE ALREADY INVOLVED IN A SENSE ONE THEY PUT IN REGULATING WHAT HAS ALREADY GONE WRONG IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN OR NOT MAKE IT WELL AT THE BACK END I MEAN WHERE WE ARE NOW THE REGULATORS GOT A VERY IMPORTANT JOB TO DO TO TRY AND SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IF IF IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TO GO INTO THIS THIS BUST SCHEME BUT THEY ALSO HAD A JOB TO DO BEFORE WE GOT TO THIS POINT
AND YOU'RE SAYING THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT JOB VERY WELL WELL I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS ABOUT IT IS THAT A SCHEME SUDDENLY WENT INTO HUGE SS ST DEFICIT AND THEN A TWENTY THREE YEAR RECOVERY PLAN WAS SET YEAH O.K. WHICH WERE WENT MANY PEOPLE THINK MUST WAS TOO LONG CHRISTINE FURNISHED THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAS TURNED TO IAN WRIGHT M.P. WHO IS THE LABOUR CHAIR OF THE BUSINESS SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE LINE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM SIR PHILIP AND INDEED FROM HIS WIFE COS YOU'VE ASKED HER TO COME AS WELL WE'RE KEEN TO FIND OUT WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN THIS ISSUE OF THE SALE AND ACQUISITION OF B.H.S. RAISES ENORMOUS QUESTIONS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY ABOUT THE PENSIONS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE DIVIDENDS SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION POUNDS WAS TAKING OUT OF B.H.S. INTO EVIDENCE OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD AND THAT'S WHEN B.H.S. THE PENSION SCHEME WAS SLIPPING INTO DEFICIT SO IT'S A CASE OF
IS IT RIGHT THAT PEOPLE CAN BUY A COMPANY STRIP IT IN MANY RESPECTS OF CASH IN TERMS OF DIVIDENDS WITHOUT REAL REGARD TO PENSIONS OR TWO EMPLOYEES
AND THEN SELL IT FOR A POUND TO UNTRIED AND UNTESTED PEOPLE WHO THEN CRUSH IT INTO THE CLIFF WILSON PHILIPPA SAID ON THAT LAST POINT IS TOLD THE JOURNALIST THE SUNDAY TIMES JOURNALIST OLIVER SHAH IF I GIVE YOU MY PLANE RIGHT AND YOU TELL ME YOU'RE A GREAT DRIVER AND YOU CRASH IT INTO THE FIRST BLEAT BLEAT BLEAT MOUNTAIN IS THAT MY FAULT
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT BUT WHAT CHECKS AND BALANCES WERE PUT IN PLACE SO WHAT HE SAYS THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE ELLIE WELL AN ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR B.H.S. WOULD BEG TO DIFFER AND THAT'S WHY I THINK PARLIAMENT IT'S TAKING A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN THIS BUT IT'S A MORAL CASE RATHER THAN A LEGAL ONE WELL JUST THE SYSTEM
PUT IN PLACE WHAT A SYSTEM OF ASSET STRIPPING RATHER THAN SORT OF LONG TERM VALUE FOR A COMPANY AND IT'S A CASE OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SELL A BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY OR DO YOU START TO CRUSH IT INTO THE CLIFF
AND THEN JUST BAIL OUT JUST BEFORE IT DOES CRASH THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT ON THE BUSINESS SELECT COMMITTEE AND WE ALSO WANT TO SEE WHETHER THE SYSTEM IS FIT FOR PURPOSE IN MAKING SURE WE CAN CAN CREATE THAT LONG TERM VALUE RATHER THAN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN EXTRACT VALUE OUT OF BUSINESS IS TO THE DETRIMENT OF EMPLOYEES AND TO THEIR DETRIMENT ULTIMATELY POTENTIALLY OF THE TAXPAYER THE DEFICIT FOR THE PENSION SCHEME IS FIVE HUNDRED
MILLION ISN'T IT A BIT DO YOU THINK HE COULD AFFORD IT IN THEORY AT LEAST FORBES SAYS HE'S WORTH FIVE
SID FOR THAT DO YOU THINK MORALLY HE SHOULD SEAT OF THE WHOLE DEFICIT MAKE SURE THAT THE WHOLE DEFICIT OF THE PENSIONERS WIPED OUT I THINK A PORTION OF THE QUESTION THAT WE WANT TO ASK SIR PHILIP GREEN IS YOU BOTH
B.H.S. YOU TOOK ENORMOUS SUMS OUT OF THE BUSINESS
THE PENSION SCHEME WENT FROM SURPLUS TO DEFICIT AND THEN YOU SOLD IT FOR A POUND TO SOMEBODY WHO WAS TWICE BANKRUPT AND I WILL HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER THE RETAIL SECTOR IS THAT APPROPRIATE STEWARDSHIP OF A BIG IMPORTANT COMPANY QUICK ONE AND JEREMY CORBIN A BIG TEST THIS WEEK WITH THE ELECTION AS WELL IS IT A BIG TEST DO YOU THINK HE'LL LIVE OR DIE THIS WEEK BY THE RESULTS ON THURSDAY
NO I DON'T THINK SO I THINK I THINK WE'LL DO WELL IN LONDON MY CONSTITUENCY WE'VE GOT ELECTIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL IN TERMS OF POLICE AND CRIME COMMISSIONERS I'M HOPING THAT WE DO WELL ALL THE EXPECTATIONS AND WITH THAT WE WILL SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT QUESTION ARISES IN THE MEDIA CHOPPED TERM IAN WRIGHT AND PETE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE SECOND OF MAY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE AMERICAN SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEGUN A NEW DIPLOMATIC PUSH TO TRY TO END THE UPSURGE OF VIOLENCE IN SYRIA NEW RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT THE ZUCKER VIOLENCE IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN SCIENTISTS HAD REALISED MINISTERS HAVE SET OUT PLANS TO CRACKDOWN ON RESTAURANTS THAT ABUSED TIPPING AND THE MYSTERY OVER WHO INVENTED THE BITTER COIN DIGITAL CURRENCY MAY HAVE BEEN SALT
TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS ZEB SOAMES THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY'S IN GENEVA FOR TALKS WITH THE ARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS ON SALVAGING THE CRUMBLING CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTESTED CITY OF ALEPPO THE TRIP WAS HASTILY ARRANGED AFTER THE U.N. ENVOY STUFF UNDER MISTER APPEALED TO THE AMERICANS AND RUSSIANS TO RESCUE THE TROOPS THEY'D SET UP MORE THAN A WEEK OF FIGHTING AT ALEPPO WAS KILLED SEVERAL HUNDRED CIVILIANS INCLUDING FORTY CHILDREN BARBARA A SHOW REPORTS FROM GENEVA
THE FIGHTING IN ALEPPO HAS UP ENDED TWO MONTHS OF RELATIVE CALM AND STYLED PEACE TALKS SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE THE U.S. BLAMES THE ESCALATION OF THE SYRIAN REGIME IT CLAIMS TO BE TARGETING ISLAMIST REBELS IN ALEPPO WHO ARE PART OF THE CEASEFIRE BUT SAYS MISTER CAREY IT'S ALSO HITTING REBELS WHO HAVE ACCEPTED THE TROOPS AS WELL AS CIVILIANS
HE'S CALLED ON THE RUSSIANS TO REIN IN THEIR ALLY BUT THESE ARE CRITICAL OURS WILL LOOK FEROCIOUS CO OPERATION WE OBVIOUSLY LOOK FOR THE REGIME TO LISTEN
THE RESPONDENT COMMUNITIES POWERFUL STATEMENT TO THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL
MUST GO RECENTLY AGREED TO REVITALISE THE CEASEFIRE IN OTHER POCKETS OF THE COUNTRY AND AT THE WEEKEND SUGGESTED THAT MIGHT EXTEND TO ALEPPO OFFICIALS HERE WILL BE WRESTLING WITH THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT COULD WORK BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS WHETHER DAMASCUS AND MOSCOW ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS YOU WON'T HAVE TO PIECE OR USING IT TO GAIN MILITARY ADVANTAGE ON THE GROUND
SCIENTISTS IN BRAZIL SAY EAGER VIRUS MAY BE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT IT'S ALREADY KNOWN TO BE THE CAUSE OF MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH AN ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS NOW EXPERTS HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE VIRUS MAY BE LINKED TO OTHER DAMAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AFFECTING ONE IN FIVE PREGNANT WOMEN WHO CONTRACT SEEKER THE FINDINGS COME JUST THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE START OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN RIO A CORRESPONDENT WE'RE DAVIS IS IN THE CITY
MOST DOCTORS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS NOW AGREED THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE MOSQUITO BORNE ZEKE A VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY WHERE BABIES ARE BORN WITH ABNORMALLY SMALL HEADS BECAUSE OF RESTRICTED BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BUT WHILE IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE PER CENT OF WOMEN WHO'VE HAD ZICA DURING PREGNANCY WILL HAVE A CHILD WITH MICROCEPHALY
DOCTORS IN BRAZIL HAVE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT AS MANY AS TWENTY PERCENT OF ZIG AFFECTED PREGNANCIES WILL RESULT IN A RANGE OF OTHER FORMS OF BRAIN DAMAGE TO THE BABY IN THE WOMB WITH THE URGENCY TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT ZEKE AND DEVELOP A VACCINE SOME RESEARCHERS ARE USING STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE NEW CELLS THAT DEVELOP LIKE HUMAN BRAINS THEY CALL THEM MANY BRAINS AND INFECT THEM WITH ZEKE
NEAR A SCIENTIST PATRICIA GUS SAYS SAID THEY WERE SHOCKED BY WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WE WERE ALL ASTONISHED BY
FAST EFFECT WE SAW A
IN THREE DAYS
BETH IN SIX DAYS THE NEW ASTURIAS OH COMPLETELY GONE
ACTING THERE WHEN THE FIRST TIME WE WERE LAYING REALLY IMPRESSED HOW POWERFUL HOW VIRAL
RATES HAVE INCREASED IN SIKA INFECTION IN SOME PARTS OF BRAZIL HAVE SLOWED THANKS TO BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PREVENTING THE DISEASE BUT WITH HER SEARCH FOR A VACCINE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION
MINISTERS HAVE BEGUN MOVES TO CHANGE TIPPING PRACTICES IN BARS AND RESTAURANTS THEY WANT STAFF TO RECEIVE TIPS IN FULL AND TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO CUSTOMERS THAT THE PAYMENTS ARE DISCRETIONARY THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SENT YOU JAVID IS PROPOSING TO UPDATE THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES VOLUNTARY CODE OF PRACTICE AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION IF NECESSARY HE SAYS THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING
TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE FINDING THAT WHEN THEY'RE LEAVING TIPS FOR HARD WORKING PEOPLE THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO THOSE PEOPLE AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE IT'S GOT TO GO TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO TO IT'S GOT TO BE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS IT'S ALSO GOT TO BE VOLUNTARY FOR GOOD SERVICE THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION IF IT DOES MEAN LEGISLATION
THEN WE WILL DO THAT I HOPE THERE'S SOME OTHER WAY BUT WE WILL TAKE ACTION IF THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BRITISH HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION WITH THE IBRAHIM TOLD US TRANSPARENCY FOR DINERS WAS ESSENTIAL
EMPOWER THE CUSTOMER TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO TIPS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO LEAVE THEM
ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE US A SERVICE CHARGE THAT THEY COULD OPT OUT OF THE CASH TIP IF THEY WISH TO AND LET THEM KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO I THINK IS TO ENSURE THAT TRANSPARENCY IS COMPULSORY AND THAT THERE IS PERHAPS A MORE CONSISTENCY AROUND THE WAY IN WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE GIVEN THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THEY BECOME AKIN AND USED TO SEEING INFORMATION IN THERE CERTAINLY
HAVE BEEN ANGRY EXCHANGES ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE DURING A TELEVISED DEBATE AHEAD OF THE HOLYROOD ELECTIONS ON THURSDAY THE IS NICOLA STURGEON SAID IF PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS NO POLITICIAN HAD THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THEIR WAY BUT THE SCOTTISH CONSERVATIVE LEADER RUTH DAVIDSON SAID THE S.N.P. HAD PROMISED THE LAST REFERENDUM WOULD BE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT OF SCOTLAND CORRESPONDENT COLIN BLAINE LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS
THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN FOUGHT ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES BUT THE IDEA OF A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM REMAINS A DEEP FAULT LINE IN SCOTTISH POLITICS
DURING THE FINAL T. V. DEBATE THE CONSERVATIVES RUTH DAVIDSON DESCRIBED IT AS AN OPEN WOUND THE S. AND P. WE DO NICOLA STURGEON DISAGREED SAYING THERE COULD BE ANOTHER SCOTTISH REFERENDUM IF THERE WAS CLEAR ON SUSTAINED EVIDENCE THAT INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND
THE SCOTTISH GREENS OFFERED BROAD SUPPORT BUT LABOUR'S KEZIA DUGDALE SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON AND THE SCOTTISH LIB DEM LEADER WILLIE RENNIE SAID CALLS FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM WERE ANTI DEMOCRATIC

RORY CATHERINE JONES REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT ONLY THREE DAYS TO GO TO THE ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT IN SCOTLAND THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY HOLDING THEIR BREATH UNLESS THE POLES HAVE GONE COMPLETELY BONKERS THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY WILL BE RETURNED TO POWER PROBABLY WITH AN EVEN BIGGER MAJORITY IN THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY
AND THEN WHAT THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY WILL PUSH FOR ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE AND THE PERSON WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS THE S.N.P. LEADER NICOLA STURGEON AND SHE IS IN OUR EDINBURGH STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND YOU ALREADY ANSWERED IT HAVEN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU THINK IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WAS A YES GO ON
CAN I JUST BEGIN WITH AN OBVIOUS POINT GO ON NOBODY IN SCOTLAND SHOULD TAKE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION FOR BLAIR WORN AN S.N.P. CUT FROM AND IF THEY WANT ME TO CONTINUE TO BE FIRST MINISTER THEIR MISSION SIN THAT THAT WILL JUST ABOUT THAT ONE NOT THE ADVERT FOR IT WAS IN A MASSIVE THE BLENDER THERE WE ARE SO IT SHOULDN'T OF INDEPENDENT MAKING OUT
SIMPLE DEMOCRATIC POINT WE HAD A REFERENDUM IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NO MUCH TO MY REGRET THOSE OF US ARGUING FOR INDEPENDENCE DIDN'T WIN THAT REFERENDUM IF THERE'S NO SHIFT IN OPINION FROM THAT WE SAW EXPRESSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT I DO IF WE DO SEE A CHEF DIDN'T OPINION AFFAIR INDEPENDENCE
BECOMES THEIR CLEO OPTION PREFERRED OPTION OF A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND THEN I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE RATE FOR POLITICIANS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT DETERMINING THAT AFFECT YOUR DECISION BELONGS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL INDEED AND THE PEOPLE MADE THEIR CHOICE BUT ASK THE QUESTION AS I RECALL
ALEX SALMOND YOUR LEADER IN THE TIME AND YOU SAID IT WAS A ONCE IN A GENERATION IF YOU PUT IT IN A TEA IF YOU THINK IT WAS SEEING JOHN WHAT I'M SEEING IS IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WILL BE UPS AND HONEY CAN BE DEMOCRATIC POINT IN THE TENT MORE CHRISSIE THAT PEOPLE ADD ENTITLED SURELY WEATHERED IN AN ELECTION AUDEN A REFERENDUM CONTEXT HAD TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS IF IRON THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN INDEPENDENCE CANNOT PERSUADE MORE PEOPLE TO BACK THAT OPTION
THAT WON'T BE A REFERENDUM BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE MAKING IT CLEAR THEY WANT IT TO PUT TO YOU WHICH YOU WERE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED POLITICIAN AND ALEX SALMOND SAID THAT THE LAST REFERENDUM WAS A WHITE QUOTE ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY WE HAVEN'T YET HAD ANOTHER JET IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN IT WAS IT WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO WITH THE GREATEST OF RESPECT JOINER I HAVE DIRECTLY ADDRESS THAT POINT WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M ONLY ONE POLITICIAN
AND I WAS THE LEADER OF THE PROXY SNAP AND OF COURSE I AM BUT EVEN EVEN THOUGH WE DID OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY IS NOT SOLELY IN CHARGE OF WHAT THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND WANT I'M MAKING THE POINT THAT IF THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT IF PEOPLE WANTED TO BE ONCE IN A GENERATION ONCE IN TEN GENERATIONS THAT'S WHAT IT WILL BE YOUR TEST IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE OF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER REFERENDUM THEN SURELY IN A DEMOCRACY THAT OPTION CANNOT SIMPLY BE ROAD THEY'VE HAD ONE BUT YES YOU WERE YOU WOULD
YOU'D HAVE AN OPINION POLL TO TEST WHETHER THEY WON'T I GATHER WHAT I'VE SEEN IS OVER A PERIOD OF MANIFESTO THAT WE PUBLISHED TWO WEEKS AGO USES THE LANGUAGE OF CREATOR AND SUSTAINED EVIDENCE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPEATED OF TABLE JOLLITY OF PEOPLE HOW MANY FOR A PARTICULAR COME ON LUCKY OH YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ARGUING LOVE THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE YOU NOT THE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT AN OPINION IT'S A COUPLE OF OPINION CLASH IN THE PAN
EVIDENCE OVER A SISTINE JUDGES THAT EVER DID DO WHAT LICK THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A DECISION TO PROPOSE ANOTHER REFERENDUM IT WOULD HAVE TO BE LEGISLATED JOBLESS PER PARLIAMENT DOMINATED BY WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET WE HAVEN'T HAD LETTERS I DO ANOTHER ANOTHER POINT HERE WHICH I'D RATHER YOU DEAL WITH THAT ONE IF YOU WOULD BECAUSE I'M ASKING YOU HOW YOU WERE JUDGED THIS OPINION HE WOULD SELLING ME IN IN A RANGE OF POURED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME THE PREFERRED OPTION OF A MAJORITY
BUT IS QUICKLY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN THE FALLAS HERE'S YOU SET WITHIN WITHIN HOW DIDN'T I WOULD BUT I BELIEVED IN AND DEPENDS ON WHAT IF I LIKE IT TO BE DIFFERENT FIVE YEARS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND WILL SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE WITHIN THAT THAMES GIT BECAUSE I ACCEPT
I DIDN'T I THOSE OF US WHO BACKED INDEPENDENCE WE DIDN'T PERSUADE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO IF WE'RE GOING TO EVER BE INDEPENDENT WE'VE GOT MORE PEOPLE TO PERSUADE IN A SECOND GO ON FOREVER COULDN'T IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE NEXT LOOK AT ME I'M ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE AFTER THAT HEY I TELL YOU WHAT WHAT IF THEY VOTED FOR INDEPENDENCE AND THEN AFTER HAVING VOTED FOR INDEPENDENCE CHANGE THEIR MINDS BUT I'M SURE YOU MIGHT HAVE POLITICIANS I DIDN'T THAT'S A KISS NOT PERHAPS NOT ME COME ON THIS IS THE REALM OF THE ABSURD NO I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP
PRETTY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO WHEN PEOPLE VOTE ON THURSDAY THE NOT VOTING FOR SCOTLAND TO BE INDEPENDENT ON THURSDAY PEOPLE IF THE S.N.P. A VOTING FOR A PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT FOR FIVE YEARS THAT IS ABOUT RECORD INVESTMENT IN HER HE'LL SERVE US REFORM OF OUR HEALTH SERVICE FOR KISS ON TACKLING THE ATTAINMENT GAP IN OUR SCHOOLS A FOCUS ON GROWING THE ECONOMY CREATING JOBS GETTING MORE PEOPLE ON TO THE LIVING WAGE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
VOTING FOR IF THEY'VE OR S. M. P. ON THURSDAY AT A GOVERNMENT LED BY ME HOPEFULLY AS FIRST MINISTER TO LEAD THE COUNTRY FORWARD FIVE YEARS AND AS FAR AS YOU PERSONALLY ARE CONCERNED YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR MANY TIMES AND WHY NOT YOU'RE LEADER OF THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE ISSUE IS SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE SO I'VE ACTUALLY LET LET'S SEE YOU WITH THE GRACE OF SPECK PERHAPS READING A MANIFEST AND OUR MANIFESTO SAYS IN TERMS THAT IF I'M RE ELECTED AS FIRST MINISTER ON THURSDAY
THEN THE CENTRAL MISSION OF THE FIVE YEARS IN WHICH I WILL BE THE COUNTRY AS FIRST MINISTER DOES EDUCATION EDUCATION AT THE HEART OF THE MANIFESTO SAYS THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE JUDGED ON OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SO YOU HAVE A DOOR FOR ME BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT CLEAR YOU THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THERE WOULD BE A SECOND REFERENDUM WITHIN YOUR PREMIERSHIP SO LET ME ASK YOU WHAT THIS A NEW SCOTLAND WOULD BE LIKE AND I ASK BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
A DIFFERENT HEAD OF STATE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE THEIR DIFFERENT DEFENCE POLICY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR OWN CURRENCY YOU'D BE STAYING IN THE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT POWER AND I THINK IF YOU WANT I WON'T USE THAT OR DID YOU JOIN I QUITE OFTEN ACCUSED BY A RANGE OF COMMENTATORS OF HAVING INDEPENDENCE UP CLEAR BUZZING ELSEWHERE BUT I'M TRYING TO SEE THAT EDUCATION IS WHAT I HAVE SAID IS THE DEFINING MISSION OF MY ITEM AND GOVERNMENT IF I'M RE ELECTED AS FIRST MINISTER
I WANT TO PUT THE FOCUS ON OUR ECONOMY ON EDUCATION ON HAYLS BUT OH YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING IS INDEPENDENCE INDEPENDENCE WILL ONLY EVER BE DECIDED BY A MAJORITY OF THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE THAT'S DEMOCRACY AND THAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT HAPPENS IN FUTURE IN A REFERENDUM ON THOSE DIE PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR A PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD AS THE S.N.P. CANDIDATE FOR FIRST MINISTER
AND IT'S SUBSTANCE TO PIGS IS ABSURD THAT PEOPLE SEE I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH AND EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY WHEN ACTUALLY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT LET'S TALK ABOUT TAXES THEN BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING YOU COULD DO WHETHER YOU'RE INDEPENDENT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THESE POWERS YOU COULD RAISE TAXES AND THEREFORE YOU COULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO JOIN WHAT I CAN I RECOMMEND TO YOU READING
S.N.P. MANIFESTO WE SAID IN THE SELECTION THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE THE TAX CUT TO HIGHER RATE TAX PAYERS THAT GEORGE OSBORNE HAS TO PUT ON ABOUT RAISING TAXES AS THE LABOUR PARTY WOULD WELL BUT WE'VE GOT THE LIVER PATTY ACCUSERS OF NOT PUTTING TAX UP AND THE WING COMMANDER'S ENOUGH WE'VE GOT THE TORIES ACCUSING US OF TAXING
HIGHER INCOME HENNIS TOO MUCH WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN FOUND TO CUT TAXES BY GEORGE OSBORNE FOR HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS WE WILL NOT USE THAT MONEY TO DO THAT INSTEAD WE WILL INVEST THAT MONEY IN GIVING HER HE'LL SERVE US AN INCREASE IN ITS BUDGET OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS MORE THAN INFLATION OVER THE NEXT PARLIAMENT ON EDUCATION
WE'RE MAKING REFORMS OF PROPOSING REFORMS TO LOCAL TAXATION THAT WILL SEE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE BIGGEST MOST EXPENSIVE HE'S P. A BIT MORE LOCAL TAX THAT MONEY AND THEY WERE VERY CAUTIOUS ISN'T IT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OVER THE PARLIAMENT WILL BE INVESTED IN OUR SCHOOLS DIRECT TO HEAD TEACHERS OVER THERE VERY VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE SCOTTISH TORIES HAD WON AND THEN THIS SLATE EVERYWHERE IS FLAUTIST HIDING THE TORIES ARE WILLING TO GIVE HIGHER RATE TAXPAYERS A MASSIVE WHOPPING TAX CUT OVER THERE YOU'RE FREE
I'M SORRY AS IN POINT OF FACT HE HAD GIVING HER THE TAXPAYERS A WHOPPING GREAT TAX CUT THAT WE ARE PROPOSING AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS FREEZING IT RIGHT SO WHAT YOU COULD BE DOING BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT IS YOU COULD PUT UP TAXES AND SPEND THAT MONEY ON EDUCATION ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT AT WHAT I'M SEEING AS WE ARE PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN THE EDUCATION BUDGET OF THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION POUNDS OVER THE NEXT AND THE MONEY IS GOING TO COME FROM
WELL LET'S ROLL BACK TWO MINUTES REFORMS TO LOCAL TAXATION WHICH I'VE JUST SAID TO TEN BILLION POUNDS DID YOU SAY THREE QUARTERS OF THAT NOTHING SORRY THREE FREAK AT THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION YOU MAY NOT READ THE RENAULT THAT'S A BIT OF A THAT'S A BIT OF A LEAP ISN'T IT MISS SPOKEN MYSELF AS THEY SAY GO THROUGH COMMITTEES THAT OUTER PHYSICIAN THAT CRIED
THAT ADDS UP TO THREE QUARTERS OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION PANES AND YOURS WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ON TOP OF WHAT WE HAD ALREADY PROPOSED IN TERMS OF A SCOTTISH A TEAM IF I KNOW THE POINT I WAS ABOUT TO MEET HUNDREDS THERE WEREN'T ISN'T THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION ONE HUNDRED MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS ON TOP OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS IN THE SCOTTISH ATTAINMENT FUND WHICH WE HAD ALREADY PROPOSED THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION POUNDS OVER A PARLIAMENT GOING TO SCHOOLS TO HELP TACKLE THE ATTAINMENT FUND THAT'S THE PROPOSAL ON EDUCATION WHAT OUT IF YOU LET ME FINISH THE POINT
IF YOU TAKE CARE OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL TAX PROPOSALS TOGETHER WENT TO PAUSING REASONING ADDITIONAL REVENUE OVER THE NEXT PARLIAMENT OF AT LEAST TWO BILLION POUNDS NO THAT IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT THAT IS NOT TIMID THAT IS NOT CAUTIOUS THESE ARE PROPOSALS TO HELP HIS MITIGATE THE ESTATE ITY BEING IMPOSED ON IS BY GEORGE OSBORNE AND REVENUE THAT WILL HELPERS INVESTOR NO HE'LL SERVICE WERE PLEDGING MORE INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH SERVICE THAN ANY OTHER PART IN THEIR SELECTION AND ALSO INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TACKLING
THE ATTAINMENT GAP IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE SCOTTISH EDUCATION IS EXCELLENT FOR EVERY SINGLE YOUNG PERSON AS IT HAS BEEN THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN FALLING UNDER YOUR STEWARDSHIP WORK THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT STRICTLY TRUE THE STANDARDS ARE RISING BUT I WANT TO SEE THEM RISE FURTHER AND FASTER THAT'S WHY THE STANDARD LAST LAST YEAR A STUDY FOUND READING STANDARDS AND I'M QUOTING AMOUNT EIGHT OR NINE YEAR OLDS IN SCOTLAND HAVE FALLEN BY FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THAT SERIOUS
WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT RECORD EXAM PASSES AND SCHOOLS WE'VE GOT RECORD NUMBERS OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING INTO WHAT ARE CALLED POSITIVE DESTINATIONS EMPLOYMENT TREE FATHER OR HIGHER EDUCATION WE'VE GOT A GROWING NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES KNOW QUALIFYING FROM HIGHER EDUCATION BASIC NUMERACY SKILLS FALLING AS WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SAID VERY OPENLY AND FRANKLY IS WE'VE GOT A DAY OUT OF INFORMATION IN OUR PRIMARY SCHOOLS ABOUT PERFORMANCE OF THE STUDY I THINK IF I'M RIGHT ABOUT THE STUDY ACCORDING TO ME
IT'S A SNAPSHOT SURVEY THAT'S WHY WE'VE PUBLISHED BEFORE THE ELECTION IN FACT A NEW NATIONAL IMPROVEMENT FREE MIGHT OUR SKILLS THAT WILL DELIVER FOR ME TELL LOIS TO REPORT ON SCOTTISH EDUCATION WHAT IF IT'S THE WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS IF IT'S ONE BEFORE CHRISTMAS I HAD A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT EDUCATION TERMS OF
HERE WE SEE DIDN'T REPORT ON MATHS AND READING A DECLINE RELATIVE UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS IS ACTUALLY STABILISED UNDER THIS ONE BUT I AM NOT COMPLACENT A BIT EDUCATION WHICH IS WHY CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU SAID TO ME EARLIER ON A BIT INDEPENDENT SEPARATE EDUCATION UP THERE AS THE DEFINING MISSION OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT IF I'M RE ELECTED AS FIRST MINISTER ON HOSTING NICOLA STURGEON THANKS A LOT THANK YOU
IT IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE ARE SOME VERY VERY GOOD NEWS THIS MORNING RORY CATHERINE JONES THE B.B.C.'S TECHNOLOGY EDITOR HAS SOMETHING OF AN EXCLUSIVE INDEED A WORLD EXCLUSIVE THE BAD NEWS IS THE FOCUS I DO SO HE HAS ACTUALLY LITERALLY RUN THE STUDIO HERE'S CAUGHT HIS BREATH AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT BIT QUITE RIGHT
THIS IS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE CREATOR OF THE COIN WHICH IS A DIGITAL CURRENCY IT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BY SOMEBODY WHO CALLED THEMSELVES FOR TOSHI KNOCK A MORTAL
THAT'S ALL WE KNEW ABOUT AND THAT WAS THE NAME WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS BEHIND THAT NAME IT GREW INTO A BIGGER AND MORE IMPORTANT AND VERY CONTROVERSIAL CURRENCY USED A LOT BY CRIMINALS AND SO ON THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND IT IS CREATING HUGE EXCITEMENT CALLED BLOCK CHAIN AND IT'S BEING USED ALREADY SPECULATED ABOUT BEING USED BY THE BIG INVESTMENT BANKS AND BY GOVERNMENTS
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AROUND AND ALL THIS TIME NO CLARITY ABOUT WHO HIS MOTIVES WERE LAST DECEMBER A MAN CALLED CRAIG WRIGHT IN AUSTRALIA WAS FIRST OUTED BY WIRED MAGAZINE AS COMMITTED THEN DISMISSED ALMOST THE NEXT DAY AS A HOAXER AND NOW HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE RECORD STRAIGHT AND HE'S TOLD THE B. B. C. HE'S GOT EVIDENCE THAT HE SIR TOSHI AND HE SUPPLIED US WITH IT
MY NAME'S CRAIG RIGHT HEN I'M ABOUT TO DEMONSTRATE
ASSIGNING OF MESSAGE WITH THE PUBLIC KEY
IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIRST TRANSACTION EVER DONE ON BIT COIN AND HE DOES THE WORLD
DID THAT FIRST TRANSACTION WHAT'S THE NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FIRST TRANSACTION THE MONKEY HERE IS SO TOSHI COMMODE
SO YOU GONNA SHOW ME IT'S A TOUCHING LETTER MOTO IS YOU YES
SOME PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE WHITE AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW YOUR HEART TO ME
I WAS THE MAIN PART OF IT OTHER PEOPLE HELP ME WHY DID YOU FEEL THOUGH THAT YOU HAD TO COME OUT OF WHAT THEM WHY DID YOU FEEL YAK KEEP SECRET FOR SO LONG
I WOULD PREFER TO BE SECRET NOW I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO BE OUT
THERE'S NOTHING ODE TO THE WORLD WHERE I HAVE TO COME OUT AND SAY I AM YES I AM WHY
NO ONE NEEDS TO DO THAT IT IS MY RIGHT
NOT
I DID SOMETHING IF I RELEASE PAPER THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS PEOPLE WHY DO I HAVE TO ACTUALLY
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT WHY DO I
WOULDN'T YOU BE PROUD TO BE KNOWN AS SIR TOUCHING UP A MOTOR YEAH BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO BOUNCE AROUND IN FRONT OF T.V.
YOU COULD SAY YOU'VE INVENTED SOMETHING AMAZING
YOU WANT TO SAY I AM THE MAN WHO PAINTED THIS I WANT TO WORK I WANT TO KEEP DOING WHAT I'M DOING AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
I DON'T WORK AND INVENT AND WRITE PAPERS AND CODE
BY COMING IN FRONT OF T.V.S I DON'T WANT MONEY I DON'T WANT FAME I DON'T WANT FEDERATION I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE
CERTAINLY SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE DOES IT WILL ANYONE NOT BILLY WELL HE'S PUT A LOT OF PROOF OUT THERE JUST TWENTY MINUTES AGO HE PUBLISHED THE BLOKE WITH INCREDIBLY TECHNICAL SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE COULD PROVE WHO HE IS AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SENIOR FIGURES IN THE BIG CON COMMUNITY WHO'VE ALSO BEEN SHOWN THIS EVIDENCE ONE OF THEM IS JOHN MY TONY
MY CONCLUSION IS THAT I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONVINCED CRAIG STEVEN WRIGHT IS
AND SOME UP THEN WHY THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE COIN
SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT
PUT IT ON THE SCALE OF THE COIN IS THE SEPARATION
MONEY AND STAY PUT GOODNESS ACHIEVEMENT ON THE SCALE OF THE GUTENBERG PRINTING PRESS WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE DECLINE OF THE VATICAN
ONCE WE COULD HAVE A MASS PRINT
I PUT IT ON THAT SCALE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL THAT THEY POINT
SO LOTS OF PEOPLE WE'RE ALL RIGHT NOW BE PORING OVER THE EVIDENCE THAT CRAIG WRIGHT HAS JUST PUBLISHED HE SAYS HE'D NOW LIKE TO DISAPPEAR FROM PUBLIC VIEW I THINK IT'LL BE QUITE HARD AND WHO ACTUALLY USES IT AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT ARE THEY
THEY ARE THERE IT IS A CURRENCY IS A DIGITAL CURRENCY THAT EXISTS ONLY ON THE INTERNET AND IT'S NOT THAT THE KEY THING ABOUT IT ATTRACTS A LOT OF INTEREST FROM WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A LIBERTARIAN POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONTROL FROM CENTRAL BANKS IT ALSO MUST BE SAID ATTRACTS A LOT OF INTEREST FROM CRIMINALS IT'S BEEN WIDELY USED BY FRAUDSTERS DRUG DEALERS AND SO ON ARE BETTER SAID THERE IS ALMOST MORE INTEREST IN THE TECHNOLOGY BENEATH IT WHICH
GOVERNMENTS AND BANKS BELIEVE COULD BE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS AS POWERFUL AS THE INTERNET HIMSELF AND THIS MAN IF IF HE IS THE MAN SHOULD BE CELEBRATED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CREATOR OF THE WORLDWIDE WEB TIM BERNERS LEE
THANKS ROB SPORT FOLLOW THAT I'LL GIVE IT MY BEST SHOT JOHN YES GOOD MORNING TO YOU THIS EVENING IT'S FIVE LIFE FOR RADIO COMMENTARY AT EIGHT P.M. ON B. B. C. ONE AT FIVE TO ELEVEN FOR T.V.

LEADER NICOLA STURGEON TOLD US THAT IF THEY WERE A SHIFT IN PUBLIC OPINION AND INDEPENDENCE BECAME THE PREFERRED OPTION IT WOULD BE WRONG FOR POLITICIANS TO STAND IN PEOPLE'S WAY

THAT HE IS THE CREATOR OF THE DIGITAL CURRENCY BIT COIN HE'S BEEN USING THE PSEUDONYM SIR TOTALLY KNACKER MOTO FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS MY WRIGHT SAID HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED HIS IDENTITY TO REMAIN A SECRET BUT HAD GIVEN IN TO PRESSURE
THANK YOU TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE FORMER INTERPRETERS FOR THE BRITISH ARMY WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING KICKED OUT OF THE U.K. BECAUSE THEY ESCAPED AFGHANISTAN INTO EUROPE BUT STOPPED FIRST IN ANOTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY SO UNDER THE RULES THEY'RE MEANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM THEY'RE ONE MAN NAMED AS NANG AIRLINE WOODS I KILLED HIMSELF LAST WEEK IN BIRMINGHAM HIS FRIENDS HE WAS DEPRESSED BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT TO BE THROWN OUT OF BRITAIN EVEN THOUGH IT WORKED
WITH BRITISH SOLDIERS IN HELMAND PROVINCE LORD ASHDOWN IS ON THE LINE FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER OF COURSE ALSO FORMER SOLDIER AND USER OF INTERPRETERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT JUST FEELS TO SO MANY PEOPLE TO BE SO WRONG
ADJUSTING WE HAVE TO ENTER CARRIER BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THEM HE HAS THE STORY YET IT'S BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE MAIL BUT ON THE SURFACE OF IT IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
AGH WRENCHES YOUR HEART OUT SIDEWAYS I MEAN HERE'S A HERE'S A MAN WHO SERVED IN HOW MOUND AS WE UNDERSTAND IT PROBABLY ON THE FRONT LINE COS I WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PROVINCE WHO DID IT DAY IN DAY OUT FOR BRITISH TROOPS NO GOING HOME EVERY SIX MONTHS WHOSE FAMILY WAS
TUCKED AWAY TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY SAFE BUT IT WAS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO THEN HAD TO LEAVE AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT HONOUR A COMMITMENT TO HIM TRAVELLED ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE WORLD TO GET TO US MADE THE MISTAKE OF BEING FINGERPRINTED IN ITALY THEN STRUGGLES TO GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL HOW HE DID IT AND THEN HE'S GOING TO BE SENT BACK I MEAN AS AN ACT OF SHAME IN OUR NATION DISHONOURING THE SERVICE THESE PEOPLE HAVE KEVIN I CAN'T THINK OF A WORSE ONE BUT IT'S THE RULE
IT WAS A RIDICULOUS RULE AND IT'S A ROLE IS IT WOULD YOU SCRAPPED THE DOMINANT CONVENTION AS WELL DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE RULE ISN'T IT THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE I THINK THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS A CAPACITY TO BE MORE GENEROUS THAN THE RULE IN TERMS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY IN THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME WHOSE JOB IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS ENABLED BRITISH TROOPS TO OPERATED AFGHANISTAN IT WAS OPEN TO THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR US DAY IN DAY OUT YEAR IN YEAR OUT IN THE AFGHAN CAMPAIGN
WOULD BE TREATED GENEROUSLY WE DID IT IN THE ROCK I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY WE DON'T DO IT IN IN AFGHANISTAN I'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS CAUSE ALONG WITH OTHERS FOR THREE YEARS NOW I'VE WARNED THE GOVERNMENT THAT THERE WAS BOUND TO BE A PERSONAL TRAGEDY IN THIS I THOUGHT IT WOULD OCCUR WITH SOMEBODY BEING KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN THIS HAS COME ABOUT I CANNOT AND I MEAN JUST
JUSTIN FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER THIS FACT IF THIS IS THE WAY WE TREAT THOSE INTERPRETERS WHO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR OUR SOLDIERS TO DO THEIR JOB AFTER WE LEAVE WHEN BRITISH SOLDIERS ARE PUT IN HARM'S WAY IN FUTURE I NEED AN INTERPRETER WHO'S GOING TO COME FORWARD TO HELP SO THERE'S A PRACTICAL SIDE TO THIS AS WELL
IT'S A DEEPLY BUT IT'S A START IT'S A FRONT IT'S JUST A STRAIGHTFORWARD MATTER OF HONOUR I BET YOU CANNOT FIND A SINGLE SOLDIER A SINGLE COMMANDER OF WHATEVER LEVEL WHOSE JOB WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THESE BRAVE MEN DAY IN DAY OUT WHO WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD NOT HONOUR THAT DEBT AND ALLOW THEM TO COME TO BRITAIN BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE THEY PROVIDE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE SET IN THE PAST I DON'T BURN GOT A SPECIFIC
COMMENTARY ON THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE THERE WHAT THEY'VE SAID IN THE PAST IS THAT AFGHANISTAN DESPERATELY NEEDS ITS WELL EDUCATED ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE THERE AND AFGHANISTAN POSSIBLY SOMETIMES THEY OVER EXAGGERATE THE EXTENT OF THE DANGER THEY'RE IN
WELL I DON'T THINK HER GOVERNMENT SITTING SAFELY IN BRITAIN IS ENTITLED TO SAY HOW DANGEROUS IT IS FOR PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND AFGHANISTAN AT THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF DANGER ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALL IN DANGER I HAD NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT THERE ARE CLEAR AND ALMOST DAILY THREATS AGAINST THEM OR A VERY SIGNIFICANT NATURE BUT IT'S A QUESTION OF A DEBT OF HONOUR THAT WE OWE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR OUR TROOPS TO DO THE JOB THEY'VE DONE AT GREAT PERSONAL COST AND RISK TO THEMSELVES DURING THE COMBAT LET ALONE TODAY GIVE ME NOT OVER THEM THAT KIND OF DEBT
OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION IT'S A PURE FIG LEAF THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE AT THE MAXIMUM
THEY HAVE A DUMB THEY'VE COMMITTED THEIR LIVES TO THE SERVICE OF A CROWN THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN HONOURABLE DECENT GENEROUS TREATMENT RETURNING TO THIS COUNTRY AND NOT BEING PLACED IN THE TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES THIS YOUNG MAN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PLACED THEM IN THE END TAKING HIS LIFE IN DESPAIR PADDY ASHDOWN THANK YOU

AND I USE THIS TO CHORD UP THAT IT CAUSED THEIR CAR AND FEEDER INTO MY MACHINE AND READ THE NUMBER BACK IN TODAY
THE EUREKA MOMENT WAS WHEN I WAS WORKING AT THIS CAN'T PUNISHED UP WITH BINARY DATA HOWDY EL LIVES THAT WAS NOT MIND READABLE COULD NOT LOOK AT THIS AND DETERMINED WHAT THE NUMBER ON IT WAS
IDEALISED THE MACHINE COULD INTERPRET THAT CONVERTED BACK INTO DECIMAL
IF THEY COME UP WITH A WAY OF KEEPING THE NUMBER SEPARATELY
USING A KEYBOARD RIGHT SAW THE THE NUMBERED RISK EDEN AND COMPARED WITH THE MACHINE READ FROM THE CARD
AND THE REST AS THEY SAY CORNER LEE BUT NEVERTHELESS IS TRUE IT IS TRUE I MEAN EVERYBODY USES PIN NUMBERS NOW LILY YES WALLIS IS A VERY CLEAN CUT WAY OF
DETERMINING WHAT YOU ARE TELLING THE MACHINE WHAT URINE PITTING
THINGS LIKE FINGERPRINTS AND RETINAL SCANS AND SO ON WERE BUT FUZZY THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO COME TOO WHAT ARE THEY REALLY ARE BUT AREN'T THEY MORE RELIABLE THOUGH THAN PIN NUMBERS BECAUSE WE CAN GET THERE ON THE REASON I SAY THEY'RE NOT POPULAR WITH SOME PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY IS BECAUSE THEY DO GET STOLEN AND SOME PEOPLE LOSE MONEY AS A RESULT OF IT YES BUT YOU'VE GOT TWO THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE PIN NUMBER AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE CAR OUT
IT'S NOT EASY YOU MAY GET ONE BUT FIND DIFFICULT TO GETTING THE ARMOUR BUT EVEN IF YOU PINCH SOMEBODY'S CARD IF YOUR PUPIL YOUR EYE YOUR RETINA RATHER DIDN'T LINE UP WITH THE OTHER PERSON THAT WOULDN'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD WITH IT
NO WELL A FEW GOT A BLACK EYE THE NAME BEFORE SO WE'RE GOING TO GET ANY MONEY I SAID MAYBE IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUSLY HURT OVER AND BLOODSHOT THAT'S POSSIBLE ISN'T IT BECOME REALLY RICH AS A RESULT OF THIS COS EVERYBODY USES IT NOW
WELL THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH DOES ANNOY HIM IN SOME WAYS I RECEIVE NOTHING I I WISH TO DO THIS KIND OF WHAT
I DON'T RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR PATENT APPLICATIONS BUT I WAS QUITE HAPPY THAT I DID A JOB A VERY SUCCESSFUL JOB
AND FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS I SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT SO I WAS NOT REALLY LOOKING FOR MONEY OR EVEN FEAR
SO I SAID NOTHING FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE CLAYTON BUT I KNOW AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE MAKING A SORT OF CLAIM FOR A BIT OF
BACK CREDIT OR SOMETHING WELL THE LIGHT CHANGED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN QUID AN EMPLOYEE COULD HAVE COMPENSATION FOR A SUCCESSFUL PATTERN
AND IT CAME ELEVEN YEARS LATE ME AND THIS WELL INVESTIGATED BUT IT WAS NOT A TRACTOR SO ROTTEN LUCK DID YOU HAVE YOU'VE GOT THE FAME AT ANY RATE THAT THE PLAUDITS AS WELL OH YOU CAN ONLY EAT SO MANY MEALS IN THE DAY
AND SO I WHAT SENSIBLE LOOKING BABY JAMES GOOD FELLOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE A FREEDIVER CALL WILLIAM TROWBRIDGE HAS BROKEN HIS OWN WORLD RECORD BY DESCENDING TO A DEPTH OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO METRES
HE DID IT AND IN A VENT IN THE BAHAMAS CALLED VERTICAL BLUE IT'S THE SIXTEENTH WORLD RECORD THAT IS BROKEN IN HIS CAREER JIM LAWLESS IS ON THE LINE AS A BRITISH FREE DIVER IN FACT THE FIRST FREE DIVE BELOW THE ONE HUNDRED METRE BARRY MORNING TEA
MORNING JUSTIN THIS IS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE ISN'T IT WONDERFUL REALLY REALLY EXCITING ANOTHER WORLD RECORD FOR WILLIAM AND HE RUNS THE VERTICAL BLUE COMPETITION HE PUTS THAT ON SO EVEN MORE FITTING AND WHAT DID HE HAVE TO DO TO TO TO TO ACHIEVE THIS BUT NOT MUM TURNS HIS PREPARATION BEFORE THAT ACTUALLY WHAT DOES THE FREE DIVE INVOLVED
WELL THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THE THE THREE MAIN THINGS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH DEALING WITH PRESSURE AND AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO METRES YOU'RE UNDER THIRTEEN TIMES YES THAT WAS FRANK PRESSURE IT'S AN INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE PRESSURE IF YOU THINK THEY WERE COMING FOR A FRACTION OF AN ATMOSPHERE'S CHANGED TO LAND AT AN AIRPORT OVER THIRTY MINUTES IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PRESSURE CHANGE AND THEN
THAT THE MENTAL THE MENTAL KEEPING IN THE ZONE MENTALLY WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE IT FEELS LIKE ON A GOOD DAY WHEN IT'S WELL IT FEELS LIKE A HUGE HUG FROM THE PLANET LIKE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY AT ONE ON A BAD DAY WHEN IT'S NOT GOING WELL YOU NEED TO TURN AROUND AND COME HOME IT'S NOT THE PASTRY WHICH YOU CAN WHAT ARE THE WARNING SIGNS AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU SAY TURN ROUND AND YOU CAN CAN YOU JUST SORT OF
JUST FLIP BACK UP AND HEAD FOR THE TOP INDEED AND THAT'S CRITICAL THIS IS THIS IS NOT A MATCH ESCORT SO SHE NEED TO PULL THE RECORDING GET OUT THEN THEN WE TURN AROUND AND WE COME BACK AS A SOMETHING GOING WRONG
THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS DIVE BECAUSE AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO METRES IT WENT WRONG AND WILL WAS UNABLE TO ATTACH THE TAG WHICH HE HAD TO BRING BACK FROM THE BOTTOM PLATE TO THE SURFACE
UNABLE TO ATTACH THE TAG TO THE VELCRO ON HIS LEG SO HE SAYS IN HIS IN HIS ONLINE MEDIA RELEASES THAT HE HAD TO TRY A COUPLE OF STROKES WITH THE TAG IN HIS HAND THEN YOU REALISED THAT WASN'T GOING TO WORK AND THEN TRY AND REATTACH THE TANK TO HIS LEG NOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT HE'S
HEAD HIS HEAD SPACE IS TOTALLY WRECKED AND JOIN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE TO HOLD YOUR BREATH TO DEAL WITH THE PRESSURE TO DO WITH THE FACT YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO METRES WITH SOMETHING GOING WRONG IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE I DUNNO ASKING RORY MCILROY TO STEP OFF THE THE EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY HAVE A ROW WITH HIS CADDY IT'S STILL COME BACK AND WIN THE MASTERS IT'S IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT WITH THAT
WITH THAT GOING WRONG HE STILL PULLED OFF THE RECORD AMAZING CONGRATULATIONS TO HIM AND JIM LIKES THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S NEARLY A QUARTER TO NINE NORTH KOREA MAY BE THE WORLD'S MOST REPRESSIVE REGIME BUT WE KNOW RELATIVELY LITTLE ABOUT IT FOR THE OBVIOUS REASON THAT IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO REPORT FROM THERE WELL THE B. B. C. IS THE ONLY WESTERN BROUGHT EXCUSE ME THE ONLY WESTERN BROADCASTER IN THE COUNTRY AS I SPEAK ACCOMPANYING A GROUP OF NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS THEY'RE THERE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE FOUNDATION RIANNA BASED GROUP THE BLEED'S DIALOGUE WITH OPPONENTS OFF AS WAYS OF AVERTING CONFLICT THEM THIS WEEK IS A BIG WEEK FOR THE COUNTRY
THE WORKERS' PARTY WHICH OSTENSIBLY RUNS IT WILL HOLD ITS FIRST CONGRESS IN NEARLY FORTY YEARS WILL STEVE EVANS IS OUR MAN IN COVER IT AND TO ACCOMPANY THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS
IT'S MAY DAY SHOWTIME IN PYONGYANG SANCTIONS ARE TIDES KIM JONG ONS NUCLEAR AMBITIONS REMAIN UNKNOWN
BUT THE BEAT GOES ON WITH THE NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA PLAYERS WHO ALSO SING
I'M FOLLOWING THREE WESTERN NOBEL LAUREATES IN THIS HYPER ISOLATED
THEIR VISIT IS CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE OF NORTH KOREA'S BRUTAL HUMAN RIGHTS
BUT THEY WANT TO SEE SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS FOR THEM
HANG ON YOU
YON YOUNG CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WE WERE SHOWN AROUND
AUDIENCE THREE HUNDRED BEERS WE SAW AN IMPRESSIVE NEW LOOKING A SCANNER USES ON SIMMONS SO SWIMMERS ARE FAMILIAR
ROOMS WITH CHILDREN ON TREADMILLS RECOVERING STRENGTH AFTER ILLNESS TUMBLING TO LEVEL LISTEN GIRLS READING AT THEIR DESKS TELL AGUS HOSPITAL NEAR SNOW SCORES
DOCTOR SIR RICHARD ROBERTS WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR MEDICINE
WAS NOT CONVINCED HE WAS SEEING THE HOSPITAL AS IT REALLY IS IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS STAGED SO THAT IT WOULDN'T
JUST LOOK AT THE LITTLE ROOM WE WENT INTO WITH THE KIDS ON THE EXERCISE MACHINES THEY DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN TO BE THERE
TO BE THERE AND I THINK THE SAME WITH HER FOUR KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM IF THREE NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS WENT TO HOSPITAL IN BREAD
PREPARE
BUT LET'S SAY THE QUEEN GOES AND VISITS A LAB THEY SHOT THEY SHOW HER AROUND AND THEY WILL TAKE HER TO THE LAMBS BUT THEY WILL TAKE HER TOTAL LAPSE TYPICALLY
WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING WHERE THERE IS STUFF GOING ON IT'S NOT JUST THAT EVERYONE'S BEEN GATHERED JUST SO THAT THEY LOOK AS THOUGH THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE PERM
THE MONUMENTS TOWER OF THE OF THE CHIP
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES FOR A DOLL NOBEL LAUREATE SO THEY SEE THE CITY SIGHTS OF COURSE I'M GOING OUT TO GET TO A BODY OF THE TOWER WHICH IS IN FIFTY MEDIA TO STAND
HERE WE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN METRES THAT'S NEARLY TWO FOOT
THIS IS THE PILLAR THAT SYMBOLISES
THEIR PHILOSOPHY ON WHICH THIS STATE IS BUILT JUDE SHOW SELF RELIANT
AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER THE PANORAMA OF PYONGYANG BEFORE US PROFESSOR ARDOUR AND CHURCH AND OVER FROM ISRAEL WHO WON THE CHEMISTRY NOBEL PRIZE TOLD ME WHY HE'S HERE
ENOUGH PEACEFUL IGNITION OFF PIECE OF IT FULLY BELIEVED THAT SCIENCE
IS THAT I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE OF PEACE AND I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD DO SOMETHING
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID TO SOMEBODY WHO'D GONE TO GERMANY IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WAS IN THE THIRD
EXTERMINATING PEOPLE PURPOSEFULLY BY JUST BY BEING JEWELS OF IT BEING GYPSIES
THIS WAS A CRUEL MURDERING MACHINE
FOR THE SAKE OF MURDER AND KILL
THE VISIT OF THE LAUREATES WILL BE OVERSHADOWED
THE FANFARE THEN WILL BE FOR KIM JONG WARDEN AT THE CONGRESS OF THE WORKERS' PARTY THE FIRST ONE FOR NEARLY FOUR
HE WILL BE APPLAUDED WITH ALMOST RELIGIOUS RAPTURE UNTIL HANDS ARE RAW
IN THE MEANTIME HE MAY GET IN ANOTHER NUCLEAR TEST
THE HARMONY IS ONLY
FROM PYONG YANG THE TIME ELEVEN MINUTES TO NINE THE MAN WHO TAUGHT JONNY WILKINSON TO KICK CAN TEACH YOU TO DO WHATEVER YOU DO BETTER THAT AT ANY RATE IS THE CLAIM THEY'VE AURAIT TAUGHT THE ENGLAND RUGBY PLAYER AND HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HOW TO USE HIS PRINCIPLES IN THE WIDER LIFE THE BOOK IS CALLED THE PRESSURE PRINCIPLE HAS JUST BEEN PUBLISHED AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO DAVE
IF YOU LOOK AT KICKING A BALL OVER THE POSTS THE WHOLE ISSUE IS PROCESS VERSES OUT COME ON WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE YOU GET CONCERNED THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO OVER THE POSTS AND THEN THE OUTCOME STARTS INTERFERING WITH YOUR PROCESS AND THIS WHOLE IDEA OF WHAT IS THE PROCESS AND HOW DOES IT HELP YOU ACHIEVE THE OUTCOME CAN BE APPLIED IN ANYTHING IN
IF YOU WERE A SALES PERSON AND YOU HAVE TO SELL A CAR YOUR PROCESS MIGHT BE CREATE RIP OR WITH THE CUSTOMER FIRST AND YOU SPEND ALL THEIR TIME DOING THAT WITHOUT RIP OR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE INFORMATION WITHOUT THE INFORMATION YOU CAN'T GET THE CAR WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE
THE TEMPTATION WILL BE TO TRY AND JUST SELL THEM THE CAR WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES AND YOU ALSO DEAL IN THE BOOK WITH BEING ABLE TO COPE
WHEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY ON A SPORTS FIELD BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN ALL OTHER AREAS OF LIFE WHAT IS THE LESSON
THAT WE TAKE FROM THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAD THE PLAYERS THAT YOU WORK WITH THAT THAT IS USEFUL IN THAT REGARD IN COMPETITION AND SADLY WARFARE AND ALL OF THAT SORT OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO COPE WITH THE UNPREDICTABLE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT OFTEN THE TRAINING IS COMFORTABLE
AND ALL LINED OUT IN A TIME TABLE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THIS AT TWO THIRTY AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THIS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE IS NO SUDDEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RE SET AND RE FOCUS AND IT'S THE RE SETTING AND REFOCUS THAT ACTUALLY DECIDES WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE OR NOT AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S APPLICABLE TO TO BUSINESS PLAYING IN FACT MORE WIDELY AND EDUCATION MORE GENERALLY IN JUST THE WAY WE TRAIN OURSELVES TO DEAL WITH LIFE
I THINK SO IT'S A BRAIN NATURALLY WANTS TO BE COMFORTABLE AND ACTUALLY PREDICT WHAT'S GOING ON AND NOT GET INTO THIS UGLY ZONE BUT REALLY YOU'RE ON EDGE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE UGLY ZONE YOU'RE MUCH MORE RECEPTIVE MUCH MORE ALERT ON AND I SPENT QUITE A LOT OF TIME WHEN I DID MY MASTERS DEGREE LOOKING AT CAN YOU TEACH INITIATIVE
IN FACT YOU CAN'T TEACH INITIATIVE BUT BY THE USE OF LANGUAGE YOU CAN ASK PEOPLE OH KAY YOU DID X.
IF YOU HAD THAT TIME AGAIN COULD YOU BE MORE EFFECTIVE BUT IF I WANT TO CLOSE PEOPLE DOWN AND NOT LET THEM THINK FOR THEMSELVES I'M GOING TO ASK I'M GOING TO SAY THAT WAS THE WRONG ANSWER
WHAT'S THE RIGHT ONE THAT BECOMES A PUZZLE MENTALITY RATHER THAN A THINKING FOR YOURSELF MENTALITY AND ALSO ADDRESSES
AND HITS BACK AGAINST THE ARGUMENT THAT WE OVER COACH IN SPORT AND IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU COACH THE RISK IS THAT YOU KIND OF PUMMEL DOWN GENIUS AND PEOPLE DON'T TAKE DECISIONS AS I THINKING OR WHAT DID THE COACH TELL ME I OUGHT TO DO IN THIS SITUATION YOU'RE SANE AWAY PROPER COACHING IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE OF A COMPLETELY ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY AND ANY FACT INTERESTINGLY THERE WAS A GREAT PHRASE WHERE SOMEBODY ONCE SAID TO ME HE SAID DON'T LET COACHING INTERFERE WITH LEARNING
AND IT IS IT IS VERY VERY TRUE AND I THINK THAT CAT COACHING GOOD COACHING IS MANAGING LEARNING AND MORE SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH YOU'RE THE WAY YOU IMPLICITLY CHANGE CONDITIONS IN GAMES AND SO I MEAN IF I WANT
KIDS LET'S SAY TWO TWO JUST SPEED UP AND INCREASE THE INTENSITY AND THEY MIGHT BE PLAYING FIVE A SIDE FOOTBALL AND I SAID O.K. RIGHT NOW WE'LL TRY I DON'T DO THAT AGAIN EXCEPT THIS TIME NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO HIT THE BALL OVER WAIST HEIGHT AND THEN I MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE IT AGAIN THIS TIME YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TWO TOUCHES
O.K. THIS TIME ONCE YOU SCORE YOU CAN'T SCORE AGAIN TILL EVERYBODY ELSE IN YOUR TEAM HAS SCORED AND THAT HE WOULD BE AMAZED AT HOW TEAMWORK AND AWARENESS SUDDENLY IMPROVES WITHOUT ME TALKING ABOUT TEAMWORK AND AWARENESS
THEY WERE A GOOD SORT YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'RE GOING TO GET A NEW LAW ON TIPPING OFF LIKE TO BE TIPPING IN RESTAURANTS AND SUCH LIKE DO WE NEED ONE THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO THINK SO IT'S BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF CONSULTATION ON IT AND THEN PRESUMABLY THE NEW LAW WILL HAPPEN WHAT SORT OF NEW LAW SHOULD THAT BE WELL I'M JOINED BY JAY RAYNER WHO YOU WILL KNOW IS THE OBSERVER'S RESTAURANT CRITIC HE DOESN'T WE DIP ON THIS CHANNEL AS WELL QUITE A LOT ACTUALLY
AND JONATHAN HARDEN WHO IS AN ACTOR AND HE SPENT MANY YEARS SUPPLEMENTING HIS INCOME AS A WAITER AND YOUR EXPERIENCE JONATHAN IS WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING IT ALL YOU KNOW I HAVE FORTUNATELY I HAVE TO SAY I HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR BUT I DID IT FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS IT WAS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF HIGH MADE MY INCOME AND PAID MY BELT WHEN I WASN'T ACTING
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT I THINK I ARE BOTH VERY MUCH AGREED ON WHAT WE WANT FOR THE INDUSTRY WILL PEOPLE BE PAID BETTER TO BE LOOKED AFTER IT FOR HER TO BE A VIABLE CAREER WITH A VIABLE TRAJECTORY BUT ACTUALLY I THINK WE JUST DISAGREE ABOUT HOW TO GET THERE AND MY THING IS THAT I DON'T TRUST RESTAURANTEURS TO PASS ON THE INCREASE IN THE ONE HUNDRED
I WORKED IN RESTAURANTS LUCKILY ENOUGH WHERE CASH TIPS WERE GETTING UP BY WAITERS AT THE END OF THE NIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES AND SO THERE WAS NO SERVICE CHARGE ON THE BILL IT WAS CASHED IT NO NO SERVICE CHARGE AT ALL I THINK THAT'S THE BIT WHERE THE BIG PROBLEMS COMMEND THE BIG CHAINS THAT WE SAW LAST YEAR ON YEAR BEFORE WE'RE EXPOSED NOT GIVING MONEY TO STAFF REALLY THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG I RESTAURANT SAT AND THEM TALKING INDEPENDENCE NOT JUST CHAINS WERE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HAVE KEPT GOING TO THE TILL YOU GET IN THERE
HER SHIFT FEE AND SOME EVEN YOU MEN THEY CAN ACCESS STEPS WERE SHOVE A MONTH'S WESTER A TRAINING WHICH TO REALLY FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S BEING SUGGESTED IS TAKING THE POWER OUT OF THE HAT AT THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THEY'RE ON THE BUSINESSES AND I JUST DON'T TRUST ENOUGH FRESH OTTERS IN THE U.K. RIGHT PASS ON THAT INCREASE REVENUE JAY WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU COS YOU DO AN AWFUL LOT OF YOU
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT TO LOOK AT MY TWENTY NO BIGGER YEAH I'D PAY THAT I PAY THE TIP I PAY THE SERVICE CHARGE FOR THE PROBLEM BUT IT IS NOT A SERVICE CHARGE AND I PUT A TEN PER CENT WHATEVER ON TOP OF BEING ON THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE PROBABLY NOT I MEAN IT HAS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY BAD FOR ME TO RAISE A STINK THE FACT IS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE ARE AWFUL AT DEALING WITH SERVICE CHARGES AND TIPPING THEY HATE IT THEY HATE TRYING TO WORK IT OUT THEY HATE TRYING TO USE IT AS SOME SORT OF
LEAVE OR EXPRESSION OF DELIGHT OR DISMAY AT WHAT'S HAPPENED AND WHAT'S MORE THERE IS SOMETHING FRANKIE PREHISTORIC FEUDAL ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE LIGHTS OF THE WONDERFUL JONATHAN HERE SHOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE CAPRICES OF MY MOOD OR EVEN OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RESTAURANT'S MOOD FOR THE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY GET AT THE END OF THE NIGHT IT DOESN'T WORK IN ANY OTHER BUSINESS IT'S NOT LIKE HAIRDRESSING YOU DO IT DON'T YOU WELL IT TAXIS WELL TAXES ARE CHANGING BECAUSE OF THE RICH THE RISE OF THOSE ONLINE OUTS AND SERVICES
TIPPING IS NO LONGER NECESSARILY ARE PART OF THAT HAIRDRESSING IS A VERY IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HAIRDRESSER BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SHOVE IT ON THE BILL AND SAY HERE'S A OBLIGATORY A DISCRETIONARY SO IF SHE SHOULD MAYBE SHOULD TIP DOC DO I THINK OF THE EDITOR OF THE TODAY PROGRAMME CAME IN AND WENT MISTER HUMPHREYS THERE WAS A FABULOUS INTERVIEW JONATHAN HERE'S AN EXTRA TWENTY QUID GO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT BY YOURSELVES HENCE WOULD DO I'M THAT I'VE GOT IT WHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER BUSINESS WHAT'S MORE
WHAT'S MORE YOU GO TO FRANCE YOU GO TO JAPAN YOU'VE GOT TO AUSTRALIA THEY DON'T DO IT AND YOU GO TO AMERICA THEY DO HAVE BIG TIME YEAH WELL THE AMERICAN SITUATION IS HILARIOUS HAVE YOU EVER TRIED NOT LEAVING UNTIL I TASTES YOU DOWN THERE SORT OF ALL I'VE BEEN YES I THINK WE CAN LEAVE AMERICA TO ITSELF THERE ARE SO MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE THE WAITERS GET A SALARY WHERE THE JOB OF BEING A WAITER IS A PROFESSION IT ISN'T HERE
EVERYBODY IS VERY HAPPY AND IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A LITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING ON TOP YOU CAN'T BUT THE BUSINESS SECRETARY'S PROPOSALS TODAY THERE WAS CLEAR AS MUD WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THEY'VE BEEN PUT OUT ON A BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY GO ON YOU SAY YOU DO YOU DISAGREE FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK I THINK THAT'S ALL VERY HONOURABLE TO SAY THAT RESTAURANT STAFF SHOULD BE PAID A FAIR SALARY I ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND I'D LOVE TO SEE A SYSTEM WHERE YOU WENT INTO A RESTAURANT RESEARCH BY SOME IN THE FIFTIES HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AND WERE FANTASTIC
THE BIG ISSUE IS THAT THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. ISN'T ONE INDUSTRY IT'S NOT THE SAME AT THE TOP AS IT IS IN THE MIDDLE AND CERTAINLY NOT AS IT IS AT THE BOTTOM AND AT THE BOTTOM I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU HAVE EXON THREE RESTAURANT IN LONDON WHERE BURGER WE'VE GOT FROM TEN POINTS A TWELVE PINTS THAT THAT EXTRA TOO QUICK BUT EVER FIND ITS WAY TO THE STUFF I DO THINK THERE DOES NEED TO BE A MASSIVE CULTURAL CHANGE I AM I AM TALKING ABOUT A RISE IN THE PRICE OF FOOD SO THAT WHEN
THE REST WHEN THE CUSTOMERS IT'S DOWN THEY LOOK AT WHAT THE COST ON THE MENU AND THEY KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY SO ACTUALLY THE BILL WON'T CHANGE FOR THEM YES IT REQUIRES A MASSIVE CULTURAL CHANGE ON THE PART OF RESTAURATEURS MAYBE THE BUSINESS SECRETARY COULD INTRODUCE THAT LAW
THAT WOULD BE FINE WOULDN'T IT BUT LOOK AT THE RELIEF ON A BANK HOLIDAY MONDAY WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT WHAT SCRAPPING TIPS AND SERVICE CHARGES I WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE TO PUT IT THROUGH THE GIRLHOOD BUT EVEN THEN YOU COULDN'T HAVE A LAW BANNING US FROM TIPPING COULD YOU CAN'T STOP PEOPLE GETTING PEOPLE I THINK THE PIG AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT AND HIT HER HIT SAY THIS BECAUSE HE HASN'T COVERED HIMSELF AND IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS BUT ACTUALLY THE BETTER SECRETARY'S PROPOSALS OF
INCENTIVISING WELL RON TRUNKS ESTIMATES BASICALLY KIDDIES THAT ADMINISTERED BY THE STAFF SO THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE STAFF MANAGEMENT ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT AND IT GOES TO WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTED TO GO I SEE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SERVED THEM AND THE PEOPLE THAT WAS COOKED THE THING ISN'T IT PAUL HOW DOES THE EVENING JAY ALL THE LUNCH WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU EXPRESS YOUR APPROVAL OR OTHERWISE ISN'T THAT SORT OF PART OF THE THING IT IF EVERYBODY'S ON A DECENT WAGE YOU EXPRESS YOUR GRATITUDE IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY WHICH IS SAY
THANK YOU THAT WAS LOVELY THANK YOU DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS BUT DOESN'T NEED A PROPER SALARY THE THING I KEEP RETURNING TO IS THIS SYSTEM WORKS PERFECTLY IN FRANCE AND JAPAN YOU TRY TIPPING IN JAPAN AND THEY WILL BE SO OFFENDED YEAH AND IF IT WORKS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHY CAN'T IT WORK
OH IS IT IT'S SIMPLY LET'S CHANGE THE CULTURE IT IS IT IS A MASSIVE THING IT'S A CULTURAL SHIFT I'M ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THAT NOTION I JUST THINK THAT IN AND IN THE PRESENT I THINK ANY KIND OF IDEALISTIC ASPIRATIONS WE HAD FOR THE INDUSTRY RIGHT THE ONE YOU BOTH DID VERY WELL COLETTE YOU TWENTY QUID ON THE WAY OUT BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A FIVER TOO I DON'T KNOW IF IT ACTUALLY SIZE TREATED THERE ARE FRINGE ON A POUND HE'S BEEN BRILLIANT TO USE ANOTHER INGREDIENT THAT'S IT JONATHAN ARMY JOHN THEY'LL EDITOR'S MORNING
