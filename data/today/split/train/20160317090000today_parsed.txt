THE CHANCELLOR HAS STAKED HIS REPUTATION ON HIS ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY EVEN IMPOSING A SET OF TIGHT FISCAL TARGETS ON HIMSELF SO FAR HE'S MISSED TWO CUTTING DEBT AS A PROPORTION OF G.D.P. THIS YEAR AND CAPPING WELFARE SPENDING

WHITLEY TO DISRUPTIVE UNCERTAINTY SPEAKING ON NEWSNIGHT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OBI A ROBERT CHOATE SAID HIS ORGANISATION HAD NOT ANALYSE THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF BRECHT'S IT ON THE ECONOMY IT HEARD QUOTED THE VIEWS OF OTHERS HE INSISTED BUT MADE NO JUDGEMENT ITSELF
PARLIAMENT HAS TOLD US TO PRODUCE OUR FORECASTS ON THE BASIS OF CURRENT GOVERNMENT POLICY AND NOT TO LOOK AT ANY ALTERNATIVES CURRENT POLICY IS TO STAY IN THE FORECAST A DUMPLING THAT BASIS SO WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY PROJECTIONS OF WHAT DIFFERENCE IT WOULD MAKE IF WE
A PROPOSED DEAL WITH TURKEY AIMED AT HALTING THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS TO THE GREEK ISLANDS IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE A MEETING OF EUROPEAN LEADERS IN BRUSSELS THIS AFTERNOON A NUMBER OF ISSUES STILL NEED TO BE RESOLVED INCLUDING WHAT TO DO ABOUT THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS TRAPPED IN GREECE AFTER MACEDONIA CLOSED ITS BORDER FROM THE FRONTIER HERE'S STUNNING SAVAGE
GREECE IS TURNING INTO EUROPE'S WAITING ROOM AND IN PLACES IT'S VERY CROWDED STOPPING THE FLOW OF PEOPLE ON SMALL BOATS FROM TURKEY TO GREECE IS THE PRIORITY OF THE SUMMIT STARTING TODAY WHAT TO DO WITH MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND MIGRANTS STUCK HERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM ALTOGETHER
DISRUPTING THE ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IN TURKEY IS TOP OF THE AGENDA FOR NOW BUT THE E.U. COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION SAYS THE ONLY WAY THE SLUM OF A BORDER CAMP ON GREASE IS NORTHERN FRONTIER WILL BE CLOSED DOWN IS FOR COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE COMMITTED TO TAKE MIGRANTS TO MAKE GOOD ON THEIR PROMISES

HER DEATH HAS ALSO BEEN ANNOUNCED OF THE AMERICAN SINGER FRANK SINATRA JUNIOR WHO CARRIED ON HIS FATHER'S LEGACY FORGING A CAREER IN MUSIC AND CONDUCTING HE WAS SEVENTY TWO
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND JOHN HAMMOND IS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING JOHN HI JOHN WELL WILL SETTLE INTO A FINE AND SUNNY DAY FOR THE MOST PLANTS AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH TEMPERATURES ON THE RISE BUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS CHILLY OUT THERE WE'VE GOT SOME AREAS OF FOG ACTUALLY ACROSS PARTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN ENGLAND SOME PARTICULARLY THICK FOG ACROSS PARTS OF EAST ANGLIA THE MOMENT THAT WILL LIFT AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF CLOUD ELSEWHERE FLOATING AROUND ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES BUT WILL TEND TO DISSOLVE WITH TIME AS WELL
SO BY THIS AFTERNOON MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES WILL BE FINE AND SUNNY PLAIN AND SIMPLE ALONG EASTERN COASTAL FRINGES THERE'S ALWAYS LIKELY TO BE AT THE RISK OF SOME LOW CLOUD COMING IN OFF THE SEA AND IT'LL KEEP THE TEMPERATURES DOWN HERE IN SINGLE FIGURES BUT FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES AFTER THAT CHILLY START TEMPERATURES WILL RISE UP INTO DOUBLE FIGURES JUST ABOUT AND THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURES WILL BE ACROSS MORE WESTERN AREAS WHERE WE COULD REACH THE LOW TEENS AND THE WINDS WON'T BE QUITE AS BRISK AS CHILLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN TICK ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS
NOW FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A DRY START THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF CLOUD OUT THERE BUT AGAIN THAT CLOUD WILL TEND TO THIN AND BREAK UP WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY AND FEEL QUITE PLEASANT WITH LIGHT WINDS AND TEMPERATURES UP INTO THE LOW TEENS POTENTIALLY
IN SOME PLACES AND FOR SCOTLAND TO THE SOME LOW CLOUD AND SOME THIS PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE CENTRAL BELT AND THAT COULD LINGER INTO THE AFTERNOON ONE OR TWO SPOTS PARTICULARLY THE EAST COAST LOOK KEEP THE TEMPERATURES DOWN HERE BUT FOR MOST OF SCOTLAND THAT'S THE STORY OF INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE AGAIN THE BEST OF THAT OUT WEST WHERE AGAIN WE COULD REACH THE MID TEENS ACROSS THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS COOLER NEAR THE EAST COAST PARTICULARLY WHERE IT STAYS CLOUDY MORE LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT DEGREES HERE
LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD TO TOMORROW MORE CLOUD AROUND SO TEMPERATURES THE CONSEQUENCE WILL BE SOMEWHAT LOWER AS WE END THE WEEK THAT'S IT BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES THANK YOU SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT LET US TURN TO THE BUDGET FIRST OF ALL ONE OF THE MAIN HEADLINES YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN FORCED TO REVISE DOWN ITS GROWTH FORECASTS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE CHANCELLOR SENT DOWN THAT HAD BEEN BECAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY IS FORECAST OF PRODUCTIVITY SO WHY WHAT'S GOING ON WHY THIS REDUCTION
IN PRODUCTIVITY AND IS IT JUST US SPEAKING ON NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT ROBERT CHOATE FROM THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY THE STRIKING FEATURE NOT JUST IN THE U.K. BUT IN MANY OTHER ECONOMY SINCE THE PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN GROWING MUCH LESS QUICKLY AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAN IT DID BEFORE
THE FIGURES THAT WE HAD AT THE TIME OF THE NOVEMBER FORECAST SHOW PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH PICKING UP QUITE NICELY IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR ALONG WITH EARNINGS GROWTH THAT'S FIZZLED AWAY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW UNIQUE TO THE U.K. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE REVISIONS THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE MADE IN THE U.S. TO TRENT PRODUCTIVITY THEY'RE ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
ALL RIGHT SO IF EVERYONE SUFFERS THIS MALAYS THE FACT HE'S STILL THAT WE NEED TO SORT OUT OUR OWN VERSION OF IT AND WE WILL SAID THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SADLY JARVIS WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE HAD A LONG RUNNING PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEM OVER SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS
PRODUCTIVITY IS ONE OF OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS THIS PARLIAMENT
OUR PRIORITY BACK IN TWENTY TEN WAS FRANKLY ECONOMIC RESCUE WE'RE JUST GONE THROUGH THE BIGGEST RECESSION IN ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS WE HAD THE BIGGEST BUDGET DEFICIT OF ENERGY TWENTY ECONOMY WE HAVE TO GET THE ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN AND THAT'S WHY IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THIS NEW GOVERNMENT
ALONG WITH THE TREASURY I PUBLISHED A PRODUCTIVITY PLAN VERY DETAILED THESE ARE LONG TERM CHANGES THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET BUT THINGS LIKE INVESTING IN SKILLS IN INFRASTRUCTURE MORE COMPETITIVE MARKETS EXPORT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN SO GROWTH DOWN PRODUCTIVITY IN TROUBLE WHAT WOULD LABOUR DO IF IT WERE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S SHOES THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN SPEAKING THE SHADOW CHIEF SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY IS SEEN MARK
IF YOU WANT TO BALANCE THE BOOKS YOU CAN DO THAT THROUGH TWO WAYS ONE IS CUTTING SPENDING AND YOU CAN DO THAT THROUGH WASTE AS WELL AND THE OTHER IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE WAYS WHICH WERE INCREASING TAX RECEIPT AND WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT YOU NEED TO BE INVESTING FOR GROWTH WE'VE SEEN A GOVERNMENT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAILURES ON EXPORTS FAILURES
WAGE GROWTH ALSO SET TO BEFALL THESE ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU SEEING PEOPLE PAYING THE PRICE OF THE FAILURES TO RUN THE ECONOMY
LOADS OF COVERAGE OF COURSE LOADS OF IT IN THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH DIVIDED THAT'S A SAY WITHIN THEMSELVES ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS A GOOD OR A BAD BUDGET MOST OF THEM HAVE GOOD THINGS TO SAY AND BAD THINGS THE MALE IS TYPICAL THIS WAS A BUNCH OF THE CONTAINED SERIOUS
PRACTICAL MEASURES TO HELP FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THE PAPERS ALWAYS CHAMPIONED THEM INDEED BY RAISING THE STARTING POINT FOR AN INCOME TAX OF THE THRESHOLD FOR THE FORTY PENCE RATE MISTER OSBORNE OPERA REELIN CENTRED PEOPLE PREPARED TO STRIVE HARD FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES BUT AND THERE IS
ALWAYS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A BUT ISN'T THERE FORGET THAT HE HADN'T A WORD TO SAY ABOUT THE N.H.S. FUNDING CRISIS FORGET EVEN IS UNDIGNIFIED DESCENT INTO ELECTIONEERING AGAINST BREAKS IT OUR GREATEST RESERVATION IS THAT HE HAS GAMBLED EVERYTHING ON PROJECTION FROM THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE PROVED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO BE UTTERLY UNRELIABLE FOR ALL THE FINE WORDS ABOUT PUTTING THE NEXT GENERATION FIRST THE GREATEST WARRIOR OF ALL IS THE
D. WORD EVEN A BISTRO OSBOURNE DOES BALANCE THE BOOKS BY TWENTY TWENTY A VERY BIG YEAR BRITAIN'S DEBT AT MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN TRILLION WILL BE MASSIVELY BIGGER THAN WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE THAT IN INFINITE DIBBLE AND PROFOUNDLY DEPRESSING
THE GUARDIAN IN THE FORM OF JONATHAN FREDA'S COLUMNIST ON THE FRONT PAGE HAS A GEORGE OSBORNE BUDGET HE'S BECOME AN EXERCISE IN MAGICAL THINKING THE CHANCELLOR COMES TO THE DISPATCH BOXES FACED MAN A SOBER TO PRESENT A VISION OF THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL FUTURE COMPRISING NOTHING MORE SOLID THAN A SERIES OF HEROIC ASSUMPTIONS ET-CETERA BUT MY FRIEND SAYS HE PROBABLY GOT AWAY WITH IT ONCE MORE YESTERDAY DELIVERING HIS EIGHTH SUCH A DRESS IT WAS A HARDER TASK THAN USUAL HE CAN RELY ON HARVEY'S AUDIENCE BEING WHOLLY SUPPORTIVE IN NORMAL TIMES THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE CASE BECAUSE OF IT
DIVISIONS IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE TELEGRAPH SLIGHTLY MORE POSITIVE IN MOST OF ITS COMMENT BUT NOT ENTIRELY SO AND GENTS KIRK UP IT'S POLITICAL
COMMENTATOR WRITES AFTER SUGARY DRINKS THIS IS THE CHAIR DRINKS TAX WHAT WILL THEIR TAX NEXT ZEPHYR THE CELL LED CELEBRITY SUGAR TAX BACK A JAMIE OLIVER WAS SHOCKED AND SURPRISED BY MISTER OSBORNE'S ANNOUNCEMENT HOW IN THAT CASE MY ARSE WAS HE OUTSIDE THE COMMONS FOR T.V. INTERVIEWS ON THE ISSUE BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR HAD EVEN LEFT THE CHAMBER SO THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX
EUROPEAN LEADERS MEET TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE GREAT MIGRATION CRISIS CHRIS MORRIS'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS SPECIFICALLY THEY'LL BE TALKING PRESUMABLY ABOUT THE PLANS DRAWN UP BETWEEN GERMANY AND TURKEY TO DEAL WITH IT
YEAH THEY WILL BASICALLY ALL TWENTY EIGHT E.U. LEADERS MEET TODAY IN THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER COMES IN TOMORROW MORNING TO TRY AND SEAL A DEAL IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE THINGS WHICH GERMANY AND TURKEY COOKED UP HAVE BEEN CHANGED SOMEWHAT COS MOST COUNTRIES HAVEN'T SEEN THEM WHEN THEY WERE FIRST PRESENTED
LAST MONDAY AND LEADERS AND IN PARTICULAR DIPLOMATS DON'T LIKE TO BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN THESE PROCESSES IN QUITE THAT WAY SO MUCH OF WHAT TURKEY WANTED AS INCENTIVES IN RETURN FOR CO OPERATION WITH ESSENTIALLY TAKING BACK ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS FROM GREECE HAS BEEN WATERED DOWN A BIT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN
UP ANY NEW NEGOTIATING CHAPTERS FOR EXAMPLE ON TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP BID UNLESS AND UNTIL IT RECOGNISES THE GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS SAYS YOU KNOW THAT TURKEY HAS HAD MILITARY FORCES IN IN NORTHERN CYPRUS IN THE SELF DECLARED BREAKAWAY TURKISH REPUBLIC OF NORTHERN CYPRUS FOR FORTY YEARS NOW THE U.N. THE Y. YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD PRETTY MUCH RECOGNISE THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS THAT AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF THE WHOLE ISLAND
IT'S AN E.U. MEMBER STATE UNTIL TURKEY RECOGNISES THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE ANY REAL PROGRESS IN MANY OF ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EVEN APART FROM THAT AS YOU SAY THAT'S A MASSIVE OBSTACLE THE DETAILS OF THE DEAL ARE A BIT BIZARRE AREN'T THEY THIS THIS ONE FOR ONE MOMENT WE WILL TAKE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AND SEND HER BACK AN ILLEGAL ONE IT'S A BIZARRE ARRANGEMENT ISN'T IT
IT IS AN ODD ARRANGEMENT AND HAS COME IN FOR A PLENTY OF CRITICISM ON ON LEGAL AND MORAL GROUNDS IN EFFECT IT SAYING ONLY IF SOMEBODY SMUGGLES THEMSELVES ACROSS THE GREEK ISLAND AND THEN GETS RETURNED FORTHWITH WILL WE AGREED TO RESETTLE ONE SYRIAN FROM A REFUGEE CAMP IN TURKEY IT'S IT DOES SEEM A VERY STRANGE THING TO DO
I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION YESTERDAY WAS GOING OUT OF ITS WAY TO SAYING EVERYTHING WE WILL DO WILL BE WILL BE LEGAL UNDER EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TO A SCHOOL CHAIR THIS SOMEBODY SAID THE SAME THING NOTHING WE WILL DO WILL BE ILLEGAL AND YET
I'VE HEARD CONCERN FROM LAWYERS REPRESENTING OTHER BUT ON THE BODIES FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT THE SENTENCE IN THE CURRENT DRAFT AGREEMENT ON THIS Y. YOU TURKEY DEAL WHICH SAYS THE Y. YOU WELCOME TO TURKEY'S COMMITMENT THAT MIGRANTS RETURN TO TURKEY WILL BE PROTECTED ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
WHAT THAT MEANS IN EFFECT IS THAT TURKEY DOESN'T APPLY THE GENEVA CONVENTION ON REFUGEES TO EVERYBODY BUT THEY USE GOING TO BE SAYING AS LONG AS YOU DO THE EQUIVALENT THING THAT'S O.K. BY US NOW MANY PEOPLE ASSEMBLE WHO'S GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES THAT HE'S GOING TO MONITOR IT WHEN YOU SENDING PEOPLE BACK IN POTENTIALLY SUCH LARGE NUMBERS HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ARE REALLY BEING APARTMENT DO YOU CHRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT IS QUARTER PAST SIX WHAT IS THE BUSINESS REACTION TO THE BUDGET JONTY PLEASE IT'S HERE ARMED WITH PLENTY OF BUSINESS TELL US OVER A QUARTER AN HOUR SO MORNING JONTY MORNING THANK YOU JUSTIN WELL IF THERE ARE ANY MORE PUNS TO BE MADE ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR SUGARING PILLS OR OFFERING SWEETENERS I CAN'T THINK OF THEM SO WE'LL IGNORE THE SUGAR TAX AND PUSH ON WITH THE BIGGER PICTURE THE CHANCELLOR'S ALREADY MISSED TWO OF HIS SELF IMPOSED FINANCIAL TARGETS A GOVERNMENT DEBT WILL FALL AS A PROPORTION OF G.D.P. THIS YEAR
HE'D ALREADY BROKEN HIS OWN WELFARE CAP A SELF IMPOSED LIMIT ON OVERALL BENEFIT SPENDING NOW HIS ONE REMAINING TARGET IS TO HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS OF TEN BILLION POUNDS BY TWENTY TWENTY IS IT THAT'S GOING TO BE A CLOSE CALL AS WELL I'M JOINED FROM EDINBURGH BYE LUCY O'CARROLL CHIEF ECONOMIST AT ABERDEEN ASS ASSET MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING LUCY MY JANTY COULD WE START OFF WITH THE BIG PICTURE STUFF DO THESE PICKED FIGURES REALLY ADD UP
WHEN WE ADD UP ON THE BASIS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S CALCULATIONS BUT WHETHER THEY'LL ADD UP BY TWENTY TWENTY IS QUITE ANOTHER MATTER WHEN YOU FACED A BIG CHALLENGE WITH THE NUMBERS WILL BE A PRESENTER TIM ON GROWTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE MEDIUM TERM BEEN ADVISED DOWN
AND HE THEN HAS A VERY STRANGE LICKING SWING FROM A DEFICIT OF TWENTY ONE BILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO A SURPLUS OF TEN BILLION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY
THAT WAS THE EYE CATCHING NUMBER FOR ME AT THE TIME OF THIS SPEECH YESTERDAY AND THAT'S THAT DRAMATIC SWING RIGHT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD SEEMS TO BE DOWN TO A BIT OF FIDDLING AROUND THE CORPORATION TAX AS WELL COMPLETELY IT'S ALL TO DO WELL NOT ALL THAT A VAST PROPORTION OF IT IS TO DO WITH HER RE TAMING OF THE BRINGING FORWARD IF HE MEANT FOR LARGE GROUPS AND CORPORATION TAX AND YOUR BED
IN EACH OTHER'S THOSE YOU CAN TELL IT'S NECK IN ACCOUNTING MEASURE AND THIS HAS ECHOES THE TAPIR
APPROACH GORDON BROWN USED TO EMPLOY WHEN HE HAD HIS PHYSICAL ROSARY HE WOULD STRETCH THE SAKE HENRI DE THE CYCLE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE FISCAL RULES MY ASPIRIN CAN DO THAT BECAUSE HE HAS BROUGHT IN THE OFFICE BUT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY VERY WELCOME DEVELOPMENT
BACK TEN AS A RESULT HE IS HOLDING ONTO HIS ONE REMAINING FISCAL RULED BY INTRODUCING THIS DEATH EXCEPT THE SWING YES IT DIDN'T DOES REMIND ME OF THAT GORDON BROWN GOING TO GOLDEN RULE I JUST JUST FINALLY LUCY THE BORROWING HOWEVER IS STILL GOING TO INCREASE OVER THAT PERIOD SO THAT THE CHANCELLOR WILL BE BORN IN QUITE A BIT MORE AS WELL
HE WILL BE BORROWING MORE BUT I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS YOU LOOK AT IS A BREAKDOWN OF THEIR NUMBER IS THE THE FACT THAT HE HAS TO ACHIEVING IN HIS MIND THIS FISCAL RULED BY TWENTY TWENTY MEANS THAT HE'S GOING TO BE RESPECTIVELY HAVING A VERY BIG FISCAL SQUEEZE AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHICH LOOKS A LITTLE ODD BUT HE STUCK IT UP AGAINST THE GENERAL ELECTION DUE IN TWENTY TWENTY
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT GOVERNMENTS NORMALLY LAY TWO TO COME TO THE ELECTRIC WITH I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR UP AT SHORT LAST NIGHT SEEING THAT THEY WILL BE OURS FOR YOU IS THAT THERE'S JUST A SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN EVENS
CHANCE OF HIM ACHIEVING THESE NUMBERS ON THE BASIS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE SO IT'S IS QUITE POSSIBLY AS GOOD AS IT GETS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO GET
THESE FIGURES THROUGH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LUCY OH CAROL FROM ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT NOW ONE FEATURE OF THIS BUDGET IS THAT WHAT GOODIES THE CHANCELLOR DID GIVE AWAY TO SMALL BUSINESSES WERE MORE THAN PAID FOR BY INCREASED TAXES ON BIG BUSINESS
BUT YOU MIGHT NOT FIND TOO MANY SMALL OR MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT AS THEY THOUGHT THE RULES WERE STACKED IN FAVOUR OF THE BIG PLAYERS FOR YEARS EMMA JONES IS IN THE STUDIO NO SHE'S AN ENTREPRENEUR AND FOUNDER OF THE SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT GROUP ENTERPRISE NATION NOW THIS THIS BUDGET EMMA HAS BEEN CALLED A BUDGET FOR SMALL BUSINESS DO YOU THINK THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT IN FACT I WAS TWEETING ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT BUDGET YES AND HE JUST KEPT ON COMING OUT WITH THEIR MAGIC TRICKS
IT WAS CORPORATION TAX THEN IT WAS BUSINESS RAISED THEN IT WAS NO NATIONAL INSURANCE CLOSE TO CONTRIBUTIONS IT WAS A FANTASTIC BRIDGE BUDGET FOR SMALL BUSINESS WHICH IS GREAT TO SEE BECAUSE FIVE MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES THEY ARE POWERING THE GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY SO HOPEFULLY THE CHANCER FEELS THAT SOME OF THESE FIGURES ARE GOING TO COME FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE AND HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE HOW MUCH YOU SAVE ON THOSE KIND OF WELL IT'S INTERESTING THAT'S THE KIND OF THE FISCAL DIFFERENCE WHICH IS YOU KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE PAYING REDUCED CORPORATE
CORPORATE TAX FROM TWENTY TWENTY THE BUSINESS RATES WHICH IS PHENOMENAL SO BRINGING SIX TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES OUT OF PAYING BUSINESS RATES IS EXCELLENT AND SOMETHING BUSINESSES HAVE ONCE FOR A WHILE BUT I THINK OVER AND ABOVE THAT THERE'S A MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAD YESTERDAY SO FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS DESPITE THE FACT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ON THE INCREASE I THINK THEY HAVE FELT A LITTLE BIT UNLOVED BECAUSE IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH REFERENCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WE REALLY DO THINK ACTUALLY HAD BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS AND PRIZED NATION THAT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTING SMALL BUSINESS IS TO SET THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO TO TO GIVE GOOD TAX CONDITIONS TO CREATE A STABLE ECONOMY AND TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DO DECIDE TO GIVE UP THE DAY JOB START A BUSINESS GOING ALONE KEEP ON GROWING EXPORTING EXCEPT HER
SO ACTUALLY WHAT YESTERDAY DID GIVE THEM WAS A GREAT BOOST IN CONFIDENCE THAT THEY'RE BEING RECOGNISED AT THE HEART OF GOVERNMENT IN THE TREASURY IS KIND OF REGULATING AND MOVING TAX IN THEIR DIRECTION AND ONE FINAL THING THAT THAT KIND OF LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IDEA WENT A BIT FURTHER THAN THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS THINGS LIKE TAXES ON INTERNET COMPANIES WHICH HAVE BEEN HITTING THE HIGH STREET AND YOUR MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE COSTS A LOT OF THEM DON'T PAY TAX HERE YOU MUST BE PLEASED WITH THAT AS WELL WELL YOU KNOW
PLATFORM SUCH AS AMAZON AND EBAY THEY'VE BEEN GREAT ENABLERS OF SMALL BUSINESS BUT I DO THINK SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DO AND HAVE ALWAYS PAID THEIR TAXES FAIRLY WOULD ALWAYS LOVE TO SEE BIG COMPANIES THROUGH THE SAME BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN I WAS OUT LAST NIGHT WITH O.TWO AND I WAS TALKING TO THEIR HEAD OF BUSINESS ABOUT THIS WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS A SMALL VERSES BIG
THERE'S A LOT OF RHETORICAL THIS MORNING YESTERDAY THAT IT'S KIND OF THE COMPANIES THAT YOU SAY THAT ARE PAYING THE PRICE OF THE FACT THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT BUDGET SMALL BUT ACTUALLY WHEN THE ECONOMY REAPS THE KIND OF BEST RETURNS IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE BIG BUSINESSES WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH SMALL SO WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE LIKES OF AMAZON ENABLING SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN YOU DO HAVE A LIGHT OF O.TWO HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES
THAT'S WHERE THE ECONOMY REALLY BENEFIT SO WE DON'T WANT A THEM AND US SMALL BUSINESSES DEFINITELY BENEFITED BUT WE WANT BIG COMPANIES TO THRIVE AS WELL EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO FIND OUT WITH THE BIG COMPANIES ARE GOING TO THRIVE AS WELL I'M JOINED BY CAROLYN FAIRBURN HE'S DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE C.B.I. NOW THAT WAS VERY NICE MESSAGE FROM EMMA BUT IT'S FACT IT'S YOUR MEMBERS WHO WERE PAYING FOR HER TAX BREAKS ISN'T IT
GOOD MORNING I MEAN I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT THE THE THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A BIG BUT BUSINESS FIRST A SMALL BUSINESS I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY FITS THE FACTS SO AND THIS WAS A SUPER BUDGET FOR FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES AND WE HUGELY MARK AND THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY A DECENT BUDGET FOR THE BIGGER BUSINESSES AS WELL SO CORPORATION TAX COMING DOWN THE STABILISATION AROUND ENERGY POLICY
THESE ARE ALL VERY WELCOME THINGS AND EVEN SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE INCREASED TAXES FOR EXAMPLE FROM TAX AVOIDANCE MEASURES THESE ARE THINGS THAT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THERE IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS AND THEY ARE NOT A SHOCK SO I THINK WE WE WOULD DO FAR BETTER TO TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND THE WAY THE BIG BUSINESSES DO WORK TOGETHER WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE ALL ONE ECONOMY
AND ACTUALLY THE MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO HELP SMALLER BUSINESS WHO MANY OF WHOM ARE PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN DELIVERING SERVICES AND GOODS TO BIGGER COMPANIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY OVERALL I THINK STOPPING TALKING ABOUT THIS DICHOTOMY I THINK WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL THING
ON ONE ISSUE THERE WAS SOME QUITE A LOT OF COMMON AND THAT IS THE TAX CHANGES ON CORPORATION TAX BEING DUMB HEAD TAP HOW HEADLINE RATE BUT YOU
REDUCE THE PROPHETS PRO PREVIOUS LOSSES IT CAN SET AGAINST PROFITS YOU REDUCE THE INTEREST PAYMENTS YOU CAN SET AGAINST CORPORATION TAX IN FUTURE THAT WILL INCREASE THE CORPORATION TAX BILL OF MANY LARGE COMPANIES ESPECIALLY ONES THAT ARE INVESTING A LOT ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THAT'S GOING TO HIT IT INVESTMENT ESPECIALLY FOR BIG COMPANIES AND I THINK THE INTERACT IN THE INTEREST RATE CAP IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE TAX AVOIDANCE MEASURES AND AND I THINK BECAUSE IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED INTERNATIONALLY THE COMPETITIVENESS WILL NOT BE HIT
IN TERMS OF THE TAX LOSSES GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT IS IT I DIDN'T AT THAT IS AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO AFFECT COMPANIES COMING OUT OF RECESSION TRYING TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESSES GOING FORWARD AND IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE BUT I THINK IT DOESN'T STILL DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT OVERALL THIS IS A BUDGET IN STORMY WATERS THAT IS DELIVERING STABILITY AND SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH KAREN AND NOW LET'S ENOUGH ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE WHAT ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES OF OUR AUDIENCE THAT SHOULD WAKE UP A FEW LISTENERS THERE'S BUDGET HAD SOME RADICAL CHANGES ON SAVINGS AND TAX OR COULD AFFECT A LOT OF PEOPLE TINA RICHARD'S NATIONAL TAX PARTNER AT SMITH AND WILLIAMSON ACCOUNTANTS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT GROUP WAS MOURNING TINA GOOD RUNNING NOW THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF THINGS AROUND CAPITAL GAINS TAX SAVINGS AND YOU JUST TAKE US THROUGH THE HIGHLIGHTS
I THINK THE KEY THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS AS WE HOPED BUT WERE WONDERING WHETHER IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IT IS CARRYING OUT ITS TARGET OF MOVING TOWARDS THEY
MUCH HIGHER PERSON MOUNTS THE HIGHER RATE THRESHOLD WHICH THEY COMMITTED TO GET TO BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT WHICH MEANS THAT WE'VE GOT THE SMALL RISES THIS YEAR THAT SORT OF MORE SIGNIFICANT ONES FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PERSONALITIES GOING UP TO ELEVEN THOUSAND AND THEY'RE HIGHER RATE THRESHOLD FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SO PEOPLE CAN
FIFTY OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND BEFORE THEY GET INTO HIGHER RATE TAX AND THERE'S A RAFT OF OTHER SMALLER RELIEFS ON VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THE SAKE SAVINGS INCOME
DIVIDEND INCOME EXCEPT HER SO IF THAT ALTOGETHER SIMPLIFIES THINGS FOR TAX NO HOW ABOUT THE IDEA OF THIS LONG TERM SAVINGS ICE AT THE RECEIVERS TOWARDS A HOUSE OR TOWARDS YOUR PENSION THE PENSION INDUSTRY WASN'T THAT KEEN ON THAT IDEA
WELL NOT IF IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GO BECAUSE THEY'RE THE COMPLICATE THERE'S COMPLICATIONS OF MOVING FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM WHAT THE CAN AND THE MAJOR CONCERN ABOUT JUST HAVING WHAT WAS CALLED PENSION ICES WAS THAT YOU PAYING INTO IT OUT OF TAXED INCOME
AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT YOU'LL TAKE THE MONEY OUT TAX FREE IF THAT IF A FUTURE GOVERNMENT CHANGE THAT AND TAX THE MONEY THAT YOU TOOK OUT OF YOUR PENSION I SO THEN YOU BE
BASICALLY BEING TAXED ON THE WAY IN AND THE WAY OUT AS WELL WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PUT MONEY INTO THAT HER AND ONE FINAL QUESTION THE BIG CHANGES OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX CORPORATION TAX DOESN'T THIS MEAN THAT WEALTHY PEOPLE ENTREPRENEURS WILL BE HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO TAKE LESS AS INCOME AND MORE AS CAPITAL GAINS AND AS SHARES AND SO ON WAS CERTAINLY YES THE THE
GREAT NOW FOR CAPITAL GAINS TAX IS LESS THAN THE RATE THAT YOU'LL BE PAYING ON UND EVIDENCE AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCES ACTUALLY GROWN SICK QUITE A LOT OVER THESE LAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE COVER GOES GONE DOWN AND THE TAX AND THEY'VE GONE UP BUT WHAT WAS ALSO BURIED IN THE DETAIL AND THE BUDGET WAS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO
TWEAK SOME OF THE ROLES AROUND HOW YOU CAN SORT OF TAKE INCOME OUT OF COMPANIES AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE RUDEST CHURN IT LIKE THAT YES IT WILL BUT IT WOULD BE FELT FAR MORE DIFFICULT SIR CHIP CHANGE INCOME INTO GAINS IN FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TINA CAROLINE EMMA AND LUCY THAT'S A BUSINESS YOU SO FAR

A CAMPAIGN IS BEING LAUNCHED TO PERSUADE PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE U.K. TO INCORPORATE A ONE MILE RUN INTO EACH DAY TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S HEALTH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PRIMARIES IN SCOTLAND HAVE TAKEN UP THE PRACTICE AS WELL AS SEVERAL SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND ABROAD
CLIFF MITCHELL MORE ONE OF THE MOST FAMILIAR FIGURES ON THE B.B.C. FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES HAS DIED AGED NINETY SIX HE PRESENTED PROGRAMMES INCLUDING RADIOS TWO WAY FAMILY FAVOURITES TONIGHT ON TELEVISION THE B.B.C.'S DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD HALL SAID HE WAS ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING BROADCASTERS OF HIS GENERATION
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WELL WE HAD A BUDGET YESTERDAY WERE HAVING ANOTHER ONE TODAY SORT OF FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR FINANCIAL STUDIES SO RESPECTED IS THE INSTITUTE OF MANY PEOPLE WAIT FOR ITS ANALYSIS BEFORE DECIDING WHAT TO MAKE OF THE REAL BUDGET YESTERDAY'S THAT IS WELL I'M JOINED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE PAUL JOHNSON AND BUY OUT A SYSTEM PULLING TOGETHER A NORMAN SMITH NO ONE FIRST REACTION POLITICAL REACTION TO THE BUDGET IS IT ALL GONNA BE PLAIN SAILING FOR THE CHANCELLOR
I DOUBT THAT BUT I MEAN I THINK THE TRUTH IS THE CHANCELLOR HAD A PRETTY LIMITED AND MUCH HARDER HAND TO PLAY YESTERDAY THEN HE WOULD'VE HOED BUT HE DID SO WITH SOME GUSTO AND SAMBA HAVE EURO FLOURISHES PARTICULARLY AIMED AT MIDDLE INCOME GROUPS WITH TAX BREAKS FOR HIGHER RATE PAYERS WITH HELP FOR
MORE AFFLUENT YOUNGER SAVERS WITH SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESS BUT WITH THE CENTRAL TRUTH IS WE STILL FACE A LONG SLOW TRUDGE THROUGH THE TUNNEL OF AUSTERITY AND HAVE ANYTHING THAT JOURNEY APPEARS TO HAVE GOT MORE ONEROUS AND THE OUTCOME MORE UNCERTAIN BECAUSE IN TERMS OF MISTER OSBORNE'S CENTRAL ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE OF BALANCING THE BOOKS INDEED MOVING INTO A CHUNKY TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS I MEAN THAT I THINK
HE'S STILL VERY QUESTIONABLE AND MANY PEOPLE WILL BE SCEPTICAL ABOUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON SOME HEROIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT IN THE LAST YEAR THIS PARLIAMENT WE ARE SUDDENLY GOING TO LEAP FROM A TWENTY BILLION POUND DEFICIT INTO A TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS AND DO THE O.B. ARE IN EFFECT SAYING CRIKEY THERE'S ONLY HALF AND A HALF CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT THE OTHER THING WHICH I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT IS THE CHANCELLOR HAS LAID THE BLAME FOR OUR DIFFICULTIES AND OUR WOES ON THE SLOWDOWN IN CHINA TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST
IT SEEMS TO ME IN THIS BUDGET THERE IS A CASE FOR SAYING THAT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS MAY ACTUALLY BE MADE IN BRITAIN PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY WHICH THE OBI A SIGHT AS THE KEY PROBLEM WE FACE NOW PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT SOMETHING MADE IN CHINA IT'S BASED ON AND THEY OWN OUR OWN JOBS ARE SORTED JOBS WE CREATE INFRASTRUCTURE OR SKILLS ARE EDUCATION THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WHICH IS THE FAULT OF THE REST OF THE WORLD THE OTHER THING IN THAT CONTEXT IS GROWTH
I MEAN THE SLOWDOWN IN THE WORLD IS NOW BUT
THE O.B. ARE AS SAYING ACTUALLY A GROWTH IS GOING TO BE SLOWING DOWN FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WHICH SUGGESTS AGAIN THERE IS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY
GOING WRONG WITH THE BRITISH ECONOMY SO IN TERMS OF HIS AMBITION AND HIS ANALYSIS I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET NO BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT PAUL JOHNSON YOUR QUESTIONS ARE WHAT
WELL AS NORMAN JUST SAID WE'VE GOT A SITUATION IN WHICH THE CHANCER IS DOING AN AWFUL LOT TO GET TO THIS BUDGET SURPLUS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUT A LOT OF THAT IS THROUGH SHUFFLING MONEY AROUND SO HE'S TAKING MONEY FORWARD FROM EARLIER YEARS HE'S ALSO CUTTING SPENDING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND INCREASING IT IN EARLIER YEARS HE'S REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT ONE PARTICULAR YEAR WHICH IS WHAT HE'S DRIVEN TO DO
BY THE VERY SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE RULE THAT HE FACES AND I THINK THE UNFORTUNATE THING IN A WAY IS OF COURSE FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW IT DOESN'T MAKE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE WHETHER WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF SURPLUS TWENTY NINETEEN OR A LITTLE BIT OF A DEFICIT THERE TRUTH IS OVER THIS WHOLE DECADE IT WILL STILL HAVE BEEN A PRETTY REMARKABLE TURNAROUND IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES IS SHUFFLING A EUPHEMISM FOR FIDDLING
NO IT IS SHUFFLING IN THAT IS THERE BUT THE PLANS HAVE CHANGED IN THE SENSE THAT PARTICULARLY A WHOLE SLEW OF CORPORATE TAX REVENUES THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO COME IN EARLIER WILL COME IN LATER IT'S A REAL CHANGE IS A SHUFFLE BUT WITHOUT THAT SHUFFLE AND WITHOUT THE COMPLETELY UNSPECIFIED PUBLIC SPENDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC SPENDING CUTS WHICH ARE COMING IN
IN THAT LAST YEAR HE WOULDN'T HAVE MET OR WOULDN'T HAVE FORECAST HIMSELF TO HAVE MET THAT SURPLUS CLEARLY CHANGING HIS BEHAVIOUR IN WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE MEETS THE TARGET AND DOING SO IN A WAY WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A SET OF THINGS WHICH HE WOULD HAVE DONE AS A SORT OF ECONOMIC THE OPTIMAL SET OF THINGS TO DO IF HE DIDN'T HAVE QUITE SUCH A TIGHT TARGET RIDE SO IT FLATTERS TO DECEIVE IN A SENSE THEN THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S IT'S VERY CLEAR BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHEN THE TARGET WAS AIMING FOR WHEN THE TARGET WAS SHE WOULDN'T YOU COULD JUST LOOK AT THE FIGURES AND SEE AH LOOK HE'S REALLY TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND HE'S NOT WORRY VERY MUCH ABOUT THE YEARS BEFORE THAT SO ONCE IT'S DONE IT'S ALSO WORTH SAYING THE CONTACTS HOT DORMANT SET ABOUT THIS LONG TUNNEL OF AUSTERITY HE'S ADDED ANOTHER YEAR TO IT THAT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T PERHAPS HE'S ADDED ANOTHER YEAR OF TIGHT SPENDING AT THE END SO WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE DONE
WITH HIS WEE WEE HE IS VERY TIGHT IT WITHIN HIS VERY TIGHT RAUL HE'S PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH THIS THIS TIME ROUND BUT AS WE WHAT HE HEARD THERE'S ONLY ABOUT A FIFTY FIFTY SHOT BUT HE'S GOING TO
GET THERE IF THINGS CHANGE AGAIN IF THE O.B. ARE DOWNGRADES ITS GROWTH FORECASTS AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS I THINK YOU WILL BE FORCED TO
PUT SOME PROPER TAX INCREASES IN OR POSSIBLY EVEN DEFINING SOME YET FURTHER PROPER SPENDING CUTS I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE LAST CHANCE THERE'LL BE GETS TO MOVE THINGS AROUND LIKE THIS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
GENUINELY BIG TO THE PUBLIC FINANCES HE'S NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITHOUT INCREASING TAXES OR CUTTING SPENDING NEXT TIME HE GETS
DOWNGRADED MORE AND MORE WORK WE'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT WAS THE LAST HE MATTERS IN THIS COUNTRY I MEAN THE TRUTH IS ACTUALLY THESE THESE DOWN WAS DOWNGRADED MC DOWNGRADING THE GROWTH FORECASTS ONLY FOUR MONTHS SINCE WE HAD THE LAST EVENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THINGS WHAT THIS DID WAS MAKE
THINGS LOOKED ABOUT THIRTEEN BILLION WORSE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S NOT A VERY BIG NUMBER IT'S NOT A VERY BIG CHANGE IN THE FORECAST YET WE STILL HAVE ALL OF THIS FIDDLING AROUND GOING ON TO MEET THIS TARGET NEXT TIME IT'LL BE A NINE MONTH GAP BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT FISCAL EVENT BUT THE NUMBERS COULD CHANGE BY MORE HE
IT MUST BE SOMETHING THAT IF I WERE CHARGED WITH KEEPING ME AWAKE AT NIGHT NOW WHICH IS IF THESE THINGS MOVE A LITTLE BIT AGAINST ME AGAIN I'M GOING TO REALLY STRUGGLE TO MEET MYSELF
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN PARIS IS ON EDGE AGAIN TODAY AFTER THE ARREST OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ISLAMIST A GANG AND THE RECONSTRUCTION AS WELL COMING TODAY OF THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE DURING THE MASS MURDER OF THE BATTER CLAN LAST YEAR LUCY WILLIAMSON'S PARIS CORRESPONDENT DOING FIRST LUCY WITH THE ARREST THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ANYTHING MORE FROM THE PLACE ON THAT
WELL IT SEEMS THAT THERE WERE THREE MEN ONE WOMAN WHO WERE PICKED UP YESTERDAY AS PART OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT WAS LAUNCHED LAST MONTH INTO AN ALLEGED PLOTS THAT WAS BEING PLANNED AGAINST THE HEART OF
THAT ALL SOUNDS VERY DRAMATIC AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THESE MEN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ON SECURITY AGENCIES LISTS UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF THE MOMENT SUGGEST THAT HE WAS ARRESTED WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO GO TO SYRIA A FEW YEARS BACK SPENT SOME TIME IN PRISON AND WAS ACTUALLY UNDER HOUSE ARREST UNDER THESE NEW EMERGENCY LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN AFTER THE NOVEMBER ATTACKS JUST PUT THAT IN SOME KIND OF CONTEXT THE INTERIOR MINISTER
HAS SAID THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO SOON TO TALK ABOUT FOILING ANY KIND OF IMMINENT ATTACK HE SAID I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT WAS BEING PLANNED IF IT WAS SOMETHING INTELLECTUAL IF IT WAS ADVANCED OR NOT OR HOW SERIOUS IT WAS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN A BIT OF CONTEXT YOU SAID THERE HAVE BEEN SEVENTY FOUR ARRESTS LIKE THIS IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AND TURNING TO WHAT THE POLICE ARE DOING TODAY THAT RECONSTRUCTING A BAY THEIR ACTIONS THE POLICE ACTIONS WHEN THE ATTACK ON THE BATTER CLAMMED HER BEGAN
THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF CRITICISM AFTER THOSE ATTACKS OF HOW THE FRENCH STATE RESPONDED TO THEM PARTICULARLY AT SECURITY FORCES AND SO THIS IS A KIND OF WALK THROUGH OF WHICH FORCES TURNED UP WHEN WHERE THEY WENT HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH THE BUILDING TO TRY AND SECURE IT
IT'S PART OF A PARLIAMENTARY ENQUIRY THAT'S LOOKING AT A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES AROUND THIS HAS BEEN AS I SAY SOME CRITICISM INCLUDING FROM SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES OF VICTIMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A COMPLETE LACK OF COMMUNICATION NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO THE POLICE
HAVING TO LOOK FOR INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO THE ENQUIRY WILL LOOK AT ALL OF THIS AND ALSO WILL LOOK AT THE ROLE OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WHICH IS AGAIN BEEN CRITICISED FOR NOT PREVENTING THE ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER IT HAS TO BE SAID OF COURSE THEY ARE FACING QUITE A DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HERE OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO
TENDED TO BE PETTY CRIMINALS WHO VERY QUICKLY TURN AROUND TO EMBRACE THE ISLAMIST IDEOLOGY SO IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO CATCH THEM IN TIME LUCY WENT TO THE BANK
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE BUDGET IS A BIG STORY OBVIOUSLY THE NEW SUGAR TAX AS USED BY MANY OF THE PAPERS AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR HEADLINES AND ANALYSIS OF THE BUDGET ACCORDED THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE CHANCELLOR TRIED TO SWEETEN THE BLEAK ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WITH A SAFETY FIRST BUDGET THE TIMES THE TELEGRAPH BOTH BELIEVE HE SHOOK PIT ALL THE TELLING THE MIRROR SO IS THE BUDGET WAS SUGAR AND SPITE HAS GEORGE OSBORNE STEPPED UP HIS WAR ON THE DISABLED BY SLASHING BENEFITS THE EXPRESS MY LEFT
BITTER TASTE BY USING HIS HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE STATEMENT TO SCARE BOATERS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF LEAVING THE E.U. NOSING TAX CUTS AND BOOST FOR SAVE US THE DAILY MAIL HAS A GREAT BUDGET FOR MIDDLE ENGLAND BUT WORRIES MISTER ONE HAS MADE AN AWESOME GAMBLE THAT HE CAN BALANCE THE BOOKS THE GUARDIAN SUGGESTED CHANCELLOR FACES A CREDIBILITY GAP AFTER USED A RANGE OF ACCOUNTING DEVICES TO DISGUISE A LOOMING BLACK HOLE IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES AND INDEPENDENT AGREES I'LL THAT BEYOND THE HEADLINE MEASURES WITH A GRIM PICTURE OF MISS TARGET INDEBTEDNESS AND JAM THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR HAS TOLD THE MIRROR THAT GEORGE OSBORNE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON HIS KNEES BEGGING FORGIVENESS FOR MISSING MANY OF HIS FISCAL TARGETS THE SHOW JOHN MCDONALD HAS WRITTEN IN THE MIRROR AND HE ACCUSES MISTER OSBORNE OF DELIVERING A BUDGET BUILT ON FAILURE HE SAYS IT'S TRULY DISGRACEFUL THE CHANCELLOR TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX ONE MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE DISABILITY PAYMENTS CONCLUDES BY INSISTING THAT LABOUR WOULD CUT THE DEFICIT
BUT NOT ON THE BACKS OF THE VULNERABLE MU DE BUCKS THE TREND BY NOT LEADING ON THE BUDGET INSTEAD IT FOCUSES ON A WOMAN HE'S BELIEVED TO RECEIVE THE U.K.'S BIGGEST EVER BLOOD TRANSFUSION NATASHA POLLOCK LOST AN ASTONISHING FORTY FOUR PINTS OF BLOOD AFTER SUFFERING COMPLICATIONS DURING AN EMERGENCY CAESAREAN SECTION TO DELIVER HER SON OLIVER SHE WAS BIDDING SO BADLY DOCTORS HAD TO USE A MACHINE TO RECYCLE DONATED BLOOD BACK INTO HER BODY BOTH MOTHER AND SON ARE BACK HOME HEALTHY FOLLOWING THE TRAUMATIC BIRTH IN DECEMBER
NOW WHAT I HEAR YOU ASKING THE HOLDS THE KEY TO MANKIND'S EXPLORATION OF THE UNIVERSE WERE ALL THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE ANSWER YOU KNEW IT ANYWHERE I EXPECT THE MADAGASCAN SAT TAILED DWARF LEMUR
IT SAYS RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY WORKING AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY PROGRAMME ARE ANALYSING WAYS TO PUT ASTRONAUTS INTO STASIS USING KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM HIBERNATING MAMMALS LINKS THE RESEARCH TO THE BUDGET OF COURSE OF THE INDIES EDITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NON POLITICAL JUNKIES MAY HAVE SLIPPED INTO SOMETHING APPROACHING TAUPE YESTERDAY AND SUGGEST THE EFFORTS OF THE SCIENTISTS CAN'T PAY OFF SOON ENOUGH NOW THAT IS A MILDLY COMPLICATE INTO THE ROOM
ANYWAY I HAD A LIVER AND DEFINITELY WANT TAILED DWARF ABSOLUTELY ONLY SCIENCE FICTION'S WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR DISPATCHING STORM TROOPERS AND ALIENS LASER BEAMS ARE BEING USED IN THE REAL WORLD ACCORDING TO THE TIMES TO SHAME THEATRE GOERS WHO REFUSED TO TURN OFF THEIR PHONES ARE GERMAN THEATRE IN THE WEST END OF LONDON IS ADOPTING A TECHNIQUE ROUTINE EMPLOYED BY ARCHERS IN CHINA
WHICH INVOLVES SHINING LASERS AT PEOPLE WHO FIDDLE WITH THEIR MOBILE AND THE HOUSE LIGHTS ARE DOWN ITS ARTISTIC DIRECTOR TELLS THE PAPER THE PHONE USE DURING PERFORMANCES MAKES PEOPLE IRRATIONALLY ANGRY AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT LEGALLY WRONG IT MAKES YOU WANT TO KILL THEM ANYWAY
QUARTER IT TO SEVEN NOW THE MAIN NEWS STILL THE BUDGET OF COURSE THE CHANCELLOR'S PLAN TO ELIMINATE THE GOVERNMENT DEFICIT BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT IS COMING UNDER MORE SCRUTINY AMID WARNINGS THAT HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE SO WAS IT AS GEORGE OSBORNE CLAIMED REPEATEDLY A BUDGET FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OR DID IT SHOW THE CHANCELLOR'S FAILED TO MEET HIS TARGETS ON DEBT AND BORROWING BOTH VIEWS HEARD VERY LOUDLY IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY IS THAT PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN CAME REPORTS
IT WAS AS GEORGE OSBORNE MIGHT HAVE SAID A BUDGET FOR WORRYING ABOUT THE KIDS WAS BORROWING STILL HIGH DEBT STILL HIGH IN GROWTH SLUGGISH HE WANTS TO MAKE THE NEXT GENERATION LEANER FITTER AND SMARTER TO COPE
SO QUITE A LOT OF WHAT THE CHANCELLOR HAD TO SAY THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN FORGED IN A FAMILY ROW AT THE TEA TABLE NEVER MIND SHOW TO GET MUM ABOUT THE HOUSEHOLD DEFICIT JUST AS THE YOUNGSTERS WERE POURING THEMSELVES A NICE BIG DRINK OF POP DAD THUNDER OUT WE ALL
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CHILDHOOD OF BEASTIE IS SUGARY DRINKS A CAN OF COLA TYPICALLY HAS NINE TEASPOONS OF SUGAR IN IT IT'S TOUGH LOVE BUT THUMPING THE TABLE HE TOLD THEM IT WAS ALL FOR THEIR OWN GOOD
I'M NOT PREPARED TO LOOK BACK AT MY TIME HERE IN THIS PARLIAMENT DOING THIS JOB AND SAY TO MY CHILDREN'S GENERATION I'M SOR
WE KNEW THAT WAS A PROBLEM WITH SUGARY DRINKS WE KNEW IT CAUSE DISEASE BUT WE DUCKED THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND WE DID NOTHING SO TODAY I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT WE WILL INTRODUCE A NEW SUGAR LEVY ON THE SOFT DRINKS INDUSTRY
THE MORE SUGAR IN DRINKS THE HIGHER THE LEVEL IN THE MANUFACTURE AND IT'LL HELP FUND WAIT FOR THE TEENAGE DOOR SLAM
MORE TIME IN SCHOOL SECONDARY SCHOOLS WE'RE GOING TO FIND LONGER SCHOOL DAYS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO OFFER THEIR PUPILS A WIDER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXTRA SPORT IT WILL BE VOLUNTARY FOR SCHOOLS COMPULSORY FOR THE PUPILS THERE'LL BE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR A QUARTER A SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO TAKE PART BUT THAT IS JUST THE START
TRIM WAIST EXTRA MATHS ACTIVITIES ARE AN TOLL THE CHANCELLOR ALSO WANTS TO HELP THE YOUTH WEALTH PEOPLE UNDER FORTY TO SAVE MORE AND WILL LOB IN A POUND FOR EVERY FOUR AS THEY SAY IN THE RUN UP TO THE BUDGET THEY'VE BEEN RUMOURS THAT MISTER OSBORNE WAS GOING TO RAISE MORE TAXES FROM PENSION SAVINGS BUT IT WAS UNPOPULAR WITH CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AS WELL AS A PENSIONS INDUSTRY SO HE DECIDED NOT TO
WE'VE CONSULTED WIDELY ON WHETHER WE SHOULD MAKE COMPULSORY CHANGES TO THEIR PENSION TAX SYSTEM BUT IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS INDEED THE FORMER PENSIONS MINISTER THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT STEVE WEBB SAID I WAS TRYING TO ABOLISH THE LUMP SUM INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE LUMPS ON ABOLISHED THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS
GALES OF CHORTLING THE LIB DEM LEADER TIM FARRON GAMELY CHUCKLE TOO THOUGH HE MAY NOT HAVE FOUND IT ALL THAT FUNNY REALLY AND THEN THE CHANCELLOR SWEPT ON TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT HAS THE STORM CLOUDS WERE GATHERING ONCE AGAIN HE WAS ONLY THINKING OF THE KIDS THEY LONELY TAX ENTERPRISE BRITAIN SICK
IN THE WORLD I COMMEND ALLOWS A BUDGET THE PUTS THE NEXT GENERATION
HE NAMECHECKED THE NEXT GENERATION A TOTAL OF EIGHTEEN TIMES EXCEPT THAT THE LABOUR LEADER DIDN'T THINK HE DID PUT THEM FIRST AT ALL
THE CHANCELLOR MIGHT HAVE SAID A GREAT DEAL ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE HE FAILED TO SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE DEBT LEVELS THAT SO MANY FORMER STUDENTS HAVE THE HIGH RENTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY THE LOWER LEVELS OF WAGES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE GET
SENSE OF INJUSTICE AND INSECURITY THAT SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FACE AND FEEL EVERY DAY THE OPPOSITION LEADER HAS THE TOUGH JOB OF RESPONDING TO THE BUDGET SPEECH WITHOUT SEEING IT IN ADVANCE AND THIS ONE CONTAINED SEVENTY SEVEN NEW MEASURES BUT JEREMY CORBIN FELT HE KNEW ENOUGH ARGUING IT WAS FULL OF DISPIRITING ECONOMIC FIGURES AND MISSED TARGETS
IT'S A RECOVERY BUILT ON SAND ON A BUDGET OF FAILURE HE'S FAILED ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT FAILED
FAILED ON INVESTMENT FAILED ON PRODUCTIVITY FAILED ON TRADE DEFICIT FAILED ON THE WELFARE CAP FAILED TO TACKLE INEQUALITY IN THIS
AND THE S.N.P. SPOKESMAN STEWART HOSIE RECKON THE CHANCELLOR WAS FAILING TO HIT ITS TARGETS ON DEBT AND BORROWING BECAUSE HE'D CHALKED OFF THEIR RECOVERY MUCH OF A FEEL YOU CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HE STRANGLED THE LIFE BLOOD FROM RECOVERY
BY CUTTING TOO MUCH TOO QUICKLY WITH LITTLE OR NO REGARD TO THE CONCERT
FINALLY STILL ON MISSED TARGETS THE LIB DEM LEADER TIM FARRON DID GET HIS OWN BACK ON THE CHANCELLOR FOR THAT UNPROVOKED JIBE EARLIER THE CHANCELLOR SAID HE WANTED TO ABOLISH THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS AND GIVEN HE HAS FAILED TO MEET EVERY OTHER BUDGET TARGET THAT IS THE BEST NEWS I HAVE HEARD A MONTH THE CHANCELLOR HAD LEFT BY THEN BUT STILL TWO CHEF
THAT WAS HIM REPORTING ON YESTERDAY AND PARLIAMENT MORE FROM HER JUST UP A HOPPER STATE ON ONE NINE EIGHT LONG WAY CAN'T HAVE TENNIS
THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS IN GREECE HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN FORTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE CONTINUING TO ARRIVE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE ELSE IN EUROPE THE BORDER CLOSURES GOING NORTH THROUGH THE BALKANS TOWARDS GERMANY MEAN THAT MIGRANTS CAN'T LEAVE ALL THAT ROOT THE ROUTE THEY WANT TO TAKE AND MANY OF THEM HOPE THAT A MEETING THEM IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WE'LL RESOLVE THAT BUT THOUSANDS OF THEM HAD MASSED ON THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA AND IS DANNY SAVAGE REPORT ANY HOPES THEY HAVE OF GETTING FURTHER ARE LIKELY TO BE DASHED
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THIS SIZE ON THE BORDER WITH MACEDONIA HAS TURNED FROM A CAMP
INTO A TENTED VILLAGE AND NOW INTO A SLUM AFTER DAYS OF RAIN THE CONDITIONS HERE ARE TERRIBLE
PEOPLE HERE ARE STAYING BECAUSE THEY HOPE THE BORDER WILL REOPEN
WE HAVE TO ER HAVE A RESULT THAT WHAT WE NEED MARIA FROM SYRIA IS JUST ONE OF THE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE WAITING FOR THE POLITICIANS TO DECIDE HER FUTURE
TO BOOKING OUR SONS IT WAS GENERALLY SO WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO THERE
BECAUSE I HAVE ONCE SOME OILY PIECE I DESERVE I WANT TO GOOD
SUCH IS THE DESPAIR OVER THE CONDITIONS AT THE FRONTIER HERE BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA THE FOOTPATHS AND ROADS ARE BUSY WITH MIGRANTS TRYING TO FIND A WAY PAST THE BORDER GUARDS TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS GERMANY
I DON'T KNOW MATT HERE FOR THE HEAD OF A TEARFUL SYRIAN WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES TURNED BACK AFTER BEING CAUGHT EXPLAINED WHY SHE AND HER CHILDREN ARE SO DESPERATE TO MOVE
SECOND NOT MY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY WANT TO BE IN DENMARK WHEN MY HUSBAND THESE AND SO DOES MY DAUGHTER WE'VE NOT SEEMS WHO FOR YEARS WHY COULDN'T THEY OPENED THE BORDERS WE'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY TWO DAYS IT'S OFFAL
THIS FAMILY IS TYPICAL OF SO MANY I'VE MET OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THEIR HUSBANDS OR FATHERS CAME WITH THE FIRST WAVE OF MIGRANTS LAST YEAR AND GOT WHERE THEY WANTED TO WHEN EUROPE BUT NOW THE WIVES AND CHILDREN ARE FOLLOWING ON AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO WAY OF REUNITING THEM
IN A NEARBY VILLAGE WE FIND STAFF THIS AGED IN HIS LATE SEVENTIES HE'S TAKEN A SYRIAN FAMILY IN TO LET THEM USE HIS SHOWER IS LITTLE BUNGALOW IS CROWDED
WELL YOU WERE ME I FEEL SORRY FOR THE KIDS HE SAYS I'VE HAD EIGHTEEN PEOPLE COME IN SO FAR TODAY
ALL OF THEM TOOK A SHOWER AND DRIED THEY'RE CLOTHES THEY ATE THEY DRANK NOW THEY WILL GO BACK TO THE CAMP I WISH THEY COULD BE AWAY FOR THEM ALL TO STAY HERE IN MY HOME
BUT THE MIGRANTS ARE UNLIKELY TO HEAR WHAT THEY WANT FROM BRUSSELS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS THE POLITICIANS ARE GOING TO PROCEED WITH THE PLAN TO STOP PEOPLE CROSSING IN BOATS FROM TURKEY TO GREECE
THAT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A SCHEME TO RELOCATE SYRIANS FROM TURKEY TO EUROPE RE OPENING THE MACEDONIAN BORDER FOR THOSE STUCK IN GREECE ISN'T ON THE AGENDA
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE'S GAME DOING'S LYING WITH THE FIFTY
WIPE THAT COMMENT WAS AIMED AT THE E.U. COMMISSIONER FOR MIGRATION THE MEAT TRIS AVRAM OBELISK WHO VISITED THE CAMP THIS WEEK HE SAYS COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE AGREED TO TAKE MIGRANTS FROM GREECE MUST HONOUR THEIR PLEDGE
IF HE'S UP MEMBERS NEEDS TO FOLLOW AND IMPLEMENT WHAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS DECIDED
I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERE'S TO DO WITH OUR POLITICAL CULTURE
IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE MOMENT THE POLICIES IMPLEMENTED SCENES LIKE THIS WILL DISAPPEAR
THE MIGRANTS HIRA QUEUING FOR THEIR RELOCATION PAPERS TO MOVE ON FROM GRACE BUT BEING TOLD THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO THE SAME COUNTRY WHERE THEIR RELATIVES ARE BUT THEY SAY THAT'S FINE AND THEY JUST WANT TO GET THE DOCUMENTS
MIGRANTS ALREADY HERE IN GREECE WILL NOT BE SENT BACK RETROSPECTIVELY IF ANY E.U. DEAL IS DONE TO RAPIDLY RETURN ALL THOSE WHO COME FROM TURKEY AND WITH ANY AGREEMENT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS PERHAPS NOT COMING INTO EFFECT FOR SOME WEEKS GREECE WILL CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
DANNY SAVAGE REPORTING THE TIME SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN A LARGE IRON AGE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN UNCOVERED IN NORTH YORKSHIRE POCKLINGTON PAUL AWARE WAS ONE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN EXCAVATING THE SITE AND IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND A CEMETERY AND NOT A SETTLEMENT THEY HAD WE'VE GOT TEN SEVENTY NINE SQUARE BARROWS
INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY BURIALS IN TOTAL SOME OF WHICH ARE DEFINITELY ANGLIA ABOUT TWENTY TWO AND THE REST ARE IRON AGE RIGHT AND IT TELLS YOU WHAT
WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS CORPUS MATERIAL THAT WE'VE GOT WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO MIGRATION PATTERNS WHERE THESE PEOPLE CAME FROM WHERE THEY INDIGENOUS TO THIS AREA OF YORKSHIRE OR HAD THEY COME FROM CONTINENTAL EUROPE WE'RE HOPING TO LOOK AT THE AGE THE REASONS WHY THEY DIED THEIR DIETS
AREA THAT THEY LIVED IN AND HABITAT AND ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF IRON AGE LIFE AND WITH AN INSIGHT THEN INTO IRON AGE LIFE THAT IS VERY RARE
YES WE TH THIS IS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF IRON AGE INFORMATION
IN EAST YORKSHIRE FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS SO WITH THE PROGRESS OF DATING SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IN UNDERSTANDING IRON AGE COMMUNITY AND YOU SENSE A CEMETERY NOT A SETTLEMENT WOULD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE TWO WOULD BE CLOSE TOGETHER BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE
THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PATTERN AND IT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THERE MUST BE A SETTLEMENT NEARBY HOWEVER THIS SITE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR ANY DOMESTIC ACTIVITY IT IS PURELY FUNERARY THAT'S INTERESTING ISN'T IT ARE YOU GOING TO SEARCH AROUND FOR THE SETTLEMENT HOPEFULLY YES WHERE WE'RE HOPING THAT ANOTHER FIELD WILL BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF THE SETTLEMENT THERE THERE'S ARE GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THIS IS OF
YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR AT OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE INTERNATIONALLY WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THAT THAT IS IS IT ALSO WE LIKE TO THINK THAT EASES OFF INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THE ACADEMIC WORLD IS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT THIS SITE CAN DELIVER AND IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO SEE THIS WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
PLANNED I WHEN YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT KEEN FROM THEM SO I WANT YOU TO TURN UP NOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WILL BE FINISHED EXCAVATION BECAUSE WE'VE OUR WORK HAS BEEN DONE AS PART OF DEVELOPMENT LED ARCHAEOLOGY SO THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE A HOUSING STATE THOUGH DAVID WILSON HOMES
BUT THE FINDS ARE ALL BEING CONCERNED AND THEY WILL START TO DISPLAY THEM IN THE FORTHCOMING YEARS HOWEVER WE'VE GOT SO MUCH WORK STILL TO UNDERTAKE AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS BUT WE WILL BE AIMING A PROGRAMME OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE A LOOK AT THESE FINE FANTASTIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO PULL AWAY AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE ON B. B. C. FOUR'S DIGGING FOR BRITAIN
AND THE TIME IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN HUNCH ON HAVING TO SAY WERE
LET'S JUST SAY WELL MOST OF US WILL END UP FINE AND SUNNY TODAY WHICH MIGHT BE QUITE HARD TO BELIEVE AS YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ACROSS SOME EASTERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT WHERE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF FOG ESPECIALLY ACROSS PARTS OF THE NORFOLK SUFFOLK CAMBRIDGESHIRE INTO THE EAST MIDLANDS SO SOME POOR VISIBILITY IS HERE THE FOG WILL LINGER THROUGH THE RUSH HOUR BEFORE EVENTUALLY THINS OUT AND BREAKS UP AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME CLOUD ACROSS OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES JUST NOWT THAT TOO WILL TEND TO DISSOLVE
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES BY THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE FINE AND SUNNY WITH THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FAIR WEATHER CLOUD THE EXCEPTION WILL BE ALONG SOME NORTH EASTERN COASTS AT ROUGHLY FROM HUMBERSIDE NORTHWARDS WHERE CLOUD WILL CONTINUE TO ROLLING OFF THE SEA AND KEEP IT COOL AT SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES BUT FOR THE REST OF ENGLAND AND WALES AFTER A CHILLY START IT WILL GET UP INTO DOUBLE FIGURES IN MOST PLACES AND UP INTO THE LOW TEENS ACROSS SOME WESTERN AREAS AND THE BREEZE WON'T BE AS NOTICEABLE OR AS CHILLY AS IT HAS BEEN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS ACROSS SOME SOUTHERN COUNTIES
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND SOME PATCHY CLOUD AROUND SOME PRETTY LOW CAD TO DRIFTING THROUGH THE CENTRAL BELT OF SCOTLAND THAT COULD LINGER INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON KEEPING IT COOL BUT FOR MOST OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND WE'LL SEE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE INCREASING TEMPERATURES TO AS HIGH AS THE MID TEENS ACROSS SOME WESTERN AREAS OF SCOTLAND PARTICULAR COOLER AGAIN SOME NORTH SEA COASTS WITH SIX OR SEVEN OR MORE LIKELY HIKE IT THANKS VERY MUCH JOHN NOW WITH NEWS OF A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE WORLD TONIGHT HERE'S RIDDLER
DOES YOUR TOWN OR CITY HAVE A TWIN HAVE YOU EVER VISITED
TWINNING WAS SEEN AS A WAY TO REUNITE EUROPE AFTER THE RAVAGES OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR SO WAS THE U.K. DEBATES WHETHER OR NOT TO REMAIN IN THAT OTHER POST WAR CLUB THE E.U. I'VE TRAVELLED TO FREIBURG IN GERMANY TO FIND OUT WHAT PEOPLE HERE THINK ABOUT THE BRITISH DEBATE AND REFERENDUM
ON THIS EVENING'S EDITION OF THE WORLD TONIGHT I'LL BE REPORTING FROM FREIBURG AND CAROLYN QUINN WILL BE IN ITS TWIN TOWN OF GUILDFORD
THE GERMANS CARE WHETHER THE U.K. STAYS OR GOES AND IN SURREY IS ANYONE'S OPINION OF THE E.U. INFLUENCED BY A TRIP TO FREIBURG THAT'S ALL ON THE WORLD TONIGHT AT TEN
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR WILL BE HERE TO GIVE HIS RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET AND WILL ALSO BE PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE VETERAN BROADCASTER CLIFF MITCHELL MORE WHOSE DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE BUDGET IS COMING UNDER MORE SCRUTINY AMID WARNINGS OF THE CHANCELLOR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE BOOKS WITHOUT MORE TAX INCREASES OR SPENDING CUTS THE PRIME MINISTER'S JOINING OTHER EUROPEAN UNION LEADERS IN BRUSSELS IN ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND THE BROADCASTER CLIFF MITCHELL MORE WHO PRESENTED EVERYTHING FROM MOON LANDINGS TO HOLIDAY PROGRAMMES HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY SIX
TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR'S PROMISED TO RETURN PUBLIC FINANCES TO THE BLACK BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL COME UNDER FURTHER SCRUTINY TODAY BY A FINANCIAL EXPERT TURNED M.P.S IN YESTERDAY'S BUDGET GEORGE OSBORNE ANNOUNCED HELP FOR YOUNG SAVERS INCREASES IN TAX ALLOWANCES AND CUTS IN CAPITAL GAINS TAX BUT IT WAS ALSO REVEALED HE NEEDED TO BORROW FIFTY SIX BILLION POUNDS MORE THAN EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
THAT WAS IN STARK CONTRAST TO AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN NOVEMBER WHEN HE SAID HE HAD AN EXTRA TWENTY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS TO SPEND THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES WILL GIVE ITS ASSESSMENT LATER TODAY HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
THE CHANCELLOR HAS STAKED HIS REPUTATION ON HIS ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY EVEN IMPOSING A SET OF TIGHT FISCAL TARGETS ON HIMSELF SO FAR HE'S MISSED TWO CUTTING DEBT AS A PROPORTION OF G.D.P. THIS YEAR AND CAPPING WELFARE SPENDING
NOW ECONOMIC ANALYSTS WARNED HE COULD STRUGGLE TO MEET HIS MOST COVETED A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT TODAY THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES WILL FOCUS ON THE CHANCELLOR'S ABILITY TO CLEAR THE DEFICIT PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF CHANGING ECONOMIC FORECASTS AND DOWNWARD PROVISIONS IN GROWTH
MY OSBORNE SAID HE WAS TAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO PROVIDE LONG TERM STABILITY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION HE FOUND MONEY TO CUT INCOME TAX AND BUSINESS RATES HELP SAVERS AND INVEST IN ROADS AND SCHOOLS BUT SOME IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OWN PARTY ARE QUESTIONING HIS DECISION TO CUT DISABILITY PAYMENTS AND EURO SCEPTIC EM PEAS ARE THREATENING TO REBEL UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT LISTENS TO CALLS TO ABOLISH TAX ON SANITARY PRODUCTS WHICH IS SET BY THE E.U.
IN ADVANCE OF HIS FORMAL PRESENTATION THIS LUNCHTIME THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES PAUL JOHNSON TOLD US THERE WAS ONLY A FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE MISTER OSBORNE WOULD MEET HIS TARGET WITHOUT TAKING MORE DRASTIC ACTION
IF THINGS CHANGE AGAIN IF THE O.B. ARE DOWNGRADES ITS GROWTH FORECASTS AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS I THINK YOU WILL BE FORCED TO
PUT SOME PROPER TAX INCREASES IN OR POSSIBLY EVEN DEFINES SOME YET FURTHER PROPER SPENDING CUTS
EUROSCEPTIC M.P.S ARE REPORTED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT REMARKS OR MISTER OSBORNE'S BUDGET SPEECH IN WHICH HE APPEARED TO SUGGEST THAT THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY AGREED THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD LEAD TO DISRUPTIVE UNCERTAINTY SPEAKING ON NEWSNIGHT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OBI ARE ROBERT CHOATE SO THE ORGANISATION HAD NOT ANALYSE THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF BRECHT'S IT ON THE ECONOMY IT HEARD QUOTED THE VIEWS OF OTHERS INSISTED BUT MADE NO JUDGEMENT ITSELF
DAVID CAMERON WILL TRAVEL TO BRUSSELS FOR A MEETING OF EUROPEAN LEADERS THIS AFTERNOON WHERE THE DETAILS OF A PROPOSED DEAL WITH TURKEY TO HOPE THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE AGENDA THERE ARE SIGNS THE AGREEMENT IS RUNNING INTO DIFFICULTY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HAS ADMITTED THE CATALOGUE OF ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE TERMS CAN BE FINALISED HIS LONG FROM BRUSSELS HE'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
THE OUTLINE OF THIS PROPOSED AGREEMENT WAS SPRUNG ON MOST E.U. LEADERS TEN DAYS AGO AFTER BEING COOKED UP BY TURKEY AND GERMANY BUT IN THE LATEST DRAFT OF THE DEAL THE INCENTIVES BEING OFFERED TO THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE FAR LESS CAST IRON THAN IT ONCE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP IT WILL BE SPEEDED UP ONLY A COMMITMENT TO PREPARE FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SECONDLY TURKEY WILL STILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL SEVENTY TWO BENCHMARKS THAT THE E.U. HAS SET OUT IF ITS CITIZENS ARE TO ENJOY THESE IF WE TRAVEL TO THE SHOWING AN AREA BY THE END OF JUNE ADD TO ALL THAT CONTINUING CRITICISM OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE IDEA OF RETURNING ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS SUMMIT HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK STILL TO DO

THERE'VE BEEN SIGHTINGS OF A BRIGHT METEOR STREAKING ABOVE BRITAIN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED THE OBJECT AS A GREEN FLASH MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH LEAVING A MAGNESIUM WHITE TRAIL THESE TWO MEN IN STAFFORD TO HAND ON THE EAST COAST OF ENGLAND TOLD THE B. B. C. WHAT THEY SAW
IT STOPS FLUSHED AND THEN SHOT OFF AT AN ANGLE BASICALLY IT DOWNWARDS
IT SHOT OFF AT AN AMAZING SPEED COMING DOWN IT WAS LIKE A TRAIL OF WHITE BLUE LIGHT AS IN THE BIG FLAPS THE WHOLE SKY
LIT UP WITH GREEN AND THEN FROM THERE WHY WOULD LIKE A FIREWORK IT'S LIKE A FIREWORK IN REVERSE IT'S THE GREEN CAME FIRST THE BEAKS
ALL RIGHT THINK EXTREME OFF PROMISE
THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THIS WAS A BUDGET FOR SMALL BUSINESS THAT WAS SO THE CHANCELLOR'S CLAIM YESTERDAY WHO WOULD HELP THEM BY ADDRESSING WHAT HE CALLED THE GREAT UNFAIRNESS THAT THEY FACE WHEN COMPETING AGAINST THE GLOBAL GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AN EBAY SO WHEN I THINK OF IT AND IN A BUSINESS SECTOR THERE TENDS TO BE IN THERE LEAVE CAMP WHEN IT COMES TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM AS THE CHANCELLOR WON THEM OVER WE WERE IN DUNSTABLE IN HERTFORDSHIRE KNOCKED OUT LONG AGO AND OUR REPORTER SIOBHAN TIE HAS BEEN BACK TO DUNSTABLE'S HEIST
HERE IS MY NON MI AS MAD I DO CLEANING IN DUNSTABLE IS BUSINESS GOOD
REALLY SLOW REALLY SO MANY EMPTY SHOPS AROUND HERE THIS IS THE SLOWEST WE HAD SO FAR EVEN WORSE IN THE RECESSION YOU SAID YOU'VE JUST GOT YOUR RATE BILL IN SMALL BUSINESSES JUST BY CHANCE IN THE BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR SAID THAT HE WAS MORE THAN DOUBLING
AND I'M QUOTING HERE THE SMALL BUSINESS RATES RELIEF IS THAT GOOD NEWS WELL HE SAID THAT MOST BUSINESSES WANT REPAYING IT IT'S THE SAME SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD PAY NO BUSINESS RATES AT ALL FROM NEXT YEAR HOPEFULLY THAT WILL COVER US HELPS WITH THE EMPTY SHOPS WHEN COMPETING WITH A SMALL B.
AND YOU'RE PAYING RATES AND BRENT WHEREAS THEY DON'T PAY ANYTHING PROBABLY RATES WAYS IT HELPS HOW WOULD YOU SPEND THAT MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ON BUSINESS RATES I'LL BUY MORE THINGS HAD HIRED SOMEBODY ELSE AREA MAYBE SATURDAY GIRL OR SOMETHING OR BOY OR A BOY YES
WHEN HE WAS A DUD SUFFER HER OWN OPTICIAN'S IN DUNSTABLE INDEPENDENT SMALL BUSINESS SO HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY A YEAR ON BUSINESS RATES WE CURRENTLY JUST OVER FOUR THOUSAND
COULD YOU BE ONE OF THESE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES ACCORDING TO GEORGE OSBORNE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO PAY BUSINESS RATES AT ALL FROM NEXT YEAR NO NOT EXACTLY BUT WE WE WOULD BE THE ONE WHO'S BENEFITING FROM A LAD SLY SUFFERED BEEN REDUCED WHAT ABOUT CORPORATION TAX BECAUSE THAT CAME INTO THE BUDGET AS WELL CORPORATION TAX WILL FALL TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY I THINK THIS IS MORE
MEDIUM TO LARGER BUSINESSES TO BENEFIT FROM THIS MEASURE IT COULD ALSO BE APPOINTED FOR THE EURO EURO FOR A REFERENDUM
GIVE THESE BUSINESS IS ATTRACTED TO REMAIN IN THE U.K. FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY NEXT QUESTION SO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW ARE YOU IN OR OUT OF THE E.U. DO YOU WANT TO BE IN OR OUT OUT AND WELL THIS BUDGET CHANGE YOUR OPINION
NO AS A SMALL BUSINESS THE TRANSLATOR HAD TO DO SOMETHING OR WHETHER IT WAS IF THERE WAS A REFERENDUM ON ORDER FRIEND THEM THIS WAS EXPECTED FOR US
HAZEL DATA I WRIGLEY'S EXOTIC PETS IN DUNSTABLE AND WHERE ARE YOU WHEN IT COMES TO THE Y. YOU IN OR OUT
FOR A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW I WOULD SAY IN AND WITH THIS BUDGET PERSUADE YOU TO STAY IN TO KEEP THAT OPINION IF IT IS MY BUSINESS RATES WERE ABOLISHED THEM POSSIBLY YES YEAH IT'S ALL ABOUT ME
COME ON TIME ARE REPORTING FROM DUNSTABLE DID I SAYS IN HERTFORDSHIRE AND I THINK IN BEDFORDSHIRE CRASHING ANYWAY IT'S IN THEM SOMEWHERE OUT THERE YEAH FAR NORTH OF ENGLAND OH YOU WERE IN TROUBLE NOW FOOTBALL ROBOID ANYWAY IT SMALL BUSINESSES WE'RE HEARING FROM THERE AND EVER SINCE GEORGE OSBORNE BECAME CHANCELLOR HE HAS BEEN PROMISING HE WILL BALANCE THE BOOKS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS IS BITS OF THE COUNTRY
HE STILL HASN'T JONTY DID THEIR BUDGET BRING HIM ANY CLOSER WON'T JOHN NOT REALLY NO IF ANYTHING LOOKS LIKE HE'S TAKEN EVEN FURTHER AWAY FROM HIS TARGET HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE A BOB BUT BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY BUT HE'S PLANNING TO PULL THIRTY BILLION POUND RABBIT OUT OF THE HAT AT THE LAST MOMENT A CUNNING PLAN FOR A HUGE SWING IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES WERE TAKEN FROM A TWENTY BILLION POUND DEFICIT IN TWENTY NINETEEN
TO A TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS IN TWENTY TWENTY ANDREW SENTENCE IN A SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER PETER B. C. AND FORMER BANK OF ENGLAND MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEMBER GOOD MORNING ANDREW MORNING I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW ON EARTH IS HE PLANNING TO MANAGERESS
WELL I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF AND THE UNDERLYING IMPROVEMENT IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES AND THEN SOME SPECIAL FACTORS WHICH KICK KICKIN IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE PARLIAMENT THE SPECIAL FACTORS BEING A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM A CORPORATION TAX SO CORPORATE TAXES COMING MORE QUICKLY THERE
AND ALSO A BIT OF AN EXTRA SQUEEZE ON PUBLIC SPENDING AND HE'S ALSO BROUGHT FORWARD SOME CAPITAL SPENDING TO EARLIER IN THE PARLIAMENT SO HE'S GOING TO SPEND LESS ON CAPITAL BUT THEY THAT CORPORATION TAXES BROUGHT TH BASI BROUGHT FORWARD TO HELP HIM BALANCE THEIR BOOKS DOES THAT MEAN HE'S GOT A PROBLEM THE NEXT YEAR FOLLOW
THE NEXT YEAR FOLLOWING IT THE DEFICIT DOESN'T IMPROVE THE SURPLUS DOESN'T IMPROVE AS SO NORMALLY IF HE WAS IF THE ECONOMY WAS GROWING AND THINGS WERE GOING WELL THERE WILL BE A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT EACH YEAR SO HE'S BRINGING FORWARD THE IMPROVEMENT BY THESE CHANGES AND CORPORATION TAX AND WHAT HE'S DOING ON PUBLIC SPENDING
AND A LOT OF THIS SWING THIS IMPROVEMENT IS AN ECONOMY WILL PERFORM DO YOU THINK THE FORECASTS ARE RIGHT WHILE THE FORECASTS ARE LOWER THAN WE'VE HAD EVEN JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT AND IT'S NOT TO DO WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THOUGH THAT WAS SIGHTED QUITE A BIT BY THE CHANCELLOR
BUT IT'S DUE TO WEAKER UNDERLYING GROWTH AND THE OFFICE OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY A FACTORING IN SLOWER PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND SLOW UNDERLYING GROWTH
IN MY VIEW THIS IS THIS IS REALISTIC OR IN WHAT I WOULD CALL A NEW NORMAL FOR GROWTH AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS SO WHAT THEY'VE NOW GOT IN WHICH IS JUST OVER TWO PERCENT A YEAR IS REALISTIC BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC FINANCES DON'T IMPROVE AS QUICKLY AS AS HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IN THE AUTUMN STATEMENT
EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS ANDREW SENTENCE JUST TWO ITEMS OF NEWS SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO TRIMMED ITS GROWTH FORECAST FOR THIS YEAR OR NEXT DUE TO WE COULD GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK GROWTH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT NEXT ANSWER ANDREW WITTY WILL RETIRE FROM GLAXOSMITHKLINE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HE'S BEEN WITH THE COMPANY FOR QUITE A FEW DECADES
THEY FEEL IT'S JONTY IT IS A QUARTER PAST SEVEN A BIG CARE COMPANY COULD BE FACING A BILL FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS FOR NOT PAYING THE MINIMUM WAGE IT'S CALLED MY HOME CARE MANY COULD FACE A GROUP ACTION LAWSUIT BY CARE WORKERS ARE PRE PAID ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS TO A CARER IN AN OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT THE CARE WILL GO TO THE COMPANY FOR NOT PAYING FOR HER TRAVEL TIME WILL ZOE COMEDY'S WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND SHE'S WITH ME TELL US ABOUT THIS CARE WORKERS
WELL CAROLINE BARLOW WORKED FOR MY HOME CARE IN DEVON AND SO SHE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE DOWN THESE NARROW COUNTRY LANES TO GET TO HER CLIENTS IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF HER TIME SHEETS ONE OF THEIR JOURNEYS WAS TWENTY SIX MILES LONG TO GET FROM ONE ELDERLY CLIENT TO ANOTHER AND SO NO WONDER IT TOOK OFF AND MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR FOR HER TO MAKE THESE JOURNEYS AND SHE WASN'T PAID
FOR ANY OF THESE JOURNEYS THAT SHE WAS MAKING AND THAT'S WHY SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE WASN'T BEING PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT'S WHY SHE BROUGHT THIS CASE AND OBVIOUSLY SHE'S DELIGHTED WITH THE OUTCOME
TO BE HONEST I WAS SOMEWHAT APPALLED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THESE LENGTHS TO GET THE MONEY THAT WAS DUE TO ME
AS TIME WENT ON IT BECAME MORE A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THAN THE ACTUAL MONEY I WAS RECEIVING SO I'M ACTUALLY DELIGHTED AT THE OUTCOME AND I'M HOPING THAT HE'D MAKE OTHER PEOPLE REALISE THAT YOU CAN TAKE ON A BIG COMPANY AND YOU CAN WIN AND IF THE LAW SAYS YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THAT MONEY THAN YOU SHOULD FIGHT FOR IT
ABS THE PEOPLE IN THE CARE INDUSTRY THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THAT THE CHAIN
WOULD ACTUALLY STOP REMEMBER THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR MONEY OF THE CARERS AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE INDEED REALISED IT
ABSOLUTELY AND THE LAW FIRM IT'S BEEN REPRESENTING HADLEY DAY IS CONSIDERING BRINGING A GROUP ACTION AGAINST MY HOME CARE IS APPEALING FOR OTHER CARE WORKERS TO COME FORWARD IT'S HAS HUNDREDS OF THEM COULD BE OWED FOR UNPAID TRAVEL TIME THEY EMPLOY FOUR AND A HALF THOUSAND CARERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES YOU CAN SEE
THAT POTENTIALLY THIS COULD TURN INTO A VERY COSTLY BUSINESS AND MY HOME CARE HAVE ISSUED US WITH A STATEMENT THEY'VE SAID THAT THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT CAROLINE BARLOW HAS CHOSEN TO TAKE TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION THEY COME HE'S ALSO SAID THAT SINCE LAST YEAR IT WAS CORRECTED CARERS PAY WHERE NECESSARY IN JANUARY FOR EXAMPLE MY HOME CARE PAID ONE HUNDRED CARATS IN SOUTH WALES UP TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH
A PREVIOUSLY UNPAID TRAVEL TIME WHAT CONCERNS CAMPAIGNERS INCLUDING UNION UNISON IS A CARERS OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE OWED THE TIMESHEETS AND HE'D LOOK AT THEM THEY'RE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED THE PAYSLIPS A COMPLICATED WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS OFTEN CARRIES THEY ACTUALLY EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE OWED IT IS THERE IS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE AND ALL THAT ISN'T THERE WHAT IS IT'S ABOUT IT
YES COS THEY'RE THE BIT OF GOVERNMENT THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING THE MINIMUM WAGE AND MORE THAN A YEAR AGO THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE BIG SIX CARE COMPANIES SO I ASKED THEM WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF THIS INVESTIGATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY DETAILS WELL IF WE KNOW THAT YOU WILL TELL HER ZOE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIMES EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN OWNERS OF DOGS THAT KILL OTHER DOGS CAN FACE HARSHER SENTENCES FROM TODAY IF THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY TRAINED TO BE AGGRESSIVE
GUIDE DOGS ASSOCIATION SAYS ONE HUNDRED GUIDE DOGS A YEAR ARE ATTACKED BY OTHER DOGS MARTIN RALPH IS ON THE LINE HIS GUIDE DOG OTTO HAS BEEN ATTACKED HIMSELF BY OTHER DOGS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT'S HAPPENED
THERE'S JUST BEEN MANY OCCASIONS UNFORTUNATELY WHERE WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED DANGEROUS DOGS
WE'VE BEEN A PARTNERSHIP NOW FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS HE'S ACTUALLY BENT
ATTACKED TO THE POINT OF FIVE TIMES THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER A PHYSICAL ATTACK ON HIMSELF TELL US ABOUT THE WORST ONE THE WORST ONE WAS POTENTIALLY
IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AND IT WAS A REAL AREA WE WERE JUST GOING FOR YOUR NORMAL SUNDAY DAY OUT WITH THE FAMILY AND HER SYSTEM AN AND ALL THAT GOING TO THE PARK AND GOT HIM OUT OF THE BOOT AND PUT HIS HARNESS AND LEAD ON AND
WE'LL JUST OPEN THE PARK PARKGATE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS GERMAN SHEPHERD RAN OVER AND LITERALLY JUST JUMPED ON HIS BACK AND
HAD HIS TEETH LITERALLY WRAPPED ROUND HIS COLLAR
OBVIOUSLY THAT TIME AT THAT WAS SCARY ENOUGH COS IT LOOKED IT DID LOCK IT WAS AS IF HE HAD HIS TEETH IN OTTO'S NECK IT WAS A VERY YOU KNOW NERVE RACKING TIME WHAT ARE THE OWNERS
AND THE OWNER UNFORTUNATELY BY THE TIME WE OR BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A MASSIVE DOG IT WE HAVE TO WRESTLE IT OFF OTTO BY TINY WRESTLE IT OFF HIM THE OWNER LITERALLY PICKED UP TO LEAD AND TOOK TOOK HIS CHILDREN AND LITERALLY RAN OFF INTO THE DISTANCE AND NO COMMENT AT ALL WHATSOEVER NOT EVEN APOLOGY NOT EVEN IF YOUR DOG O.K.
HAVE YOU GONE TO THE POLICE DURING THE OR AFTER THESE ATTACKS MIGHT NEVER THEY FOLLOWED IT UP AT ALL THAT INCIDENT IN PARTICULAR WAS BEFORE THE LEGISLATION WAS MOVED FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE ACTUAL DANGEROUS DOGS ACT SO THAT WAS THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OF JUNE AND THE POLICE LITERALLY SAID UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T FEEL THERE'S A LOT THEY COULD DO AT THAT TIME SO I THOUGHT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY MADONNA REGARDING THAT INCIDENT
DO YOU FEEL THEN THAT THE CHANGE IN THE SENTENCING SO THAT IF IF IT APPEARS THAT A DOG HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY TRAINED TO BE AGGRESSIVE THEN THE SENTENCE COULD BE COULD BE HARSHER FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU HOPE IT WORKS DO YOU THINK IT WILL
I MEAN IT IS AS YOU SAY A DEFINITE I HOPE IT WORKS BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE EDUCATION AROUND IT AS WELL FOR GUIDE DOG OWNERS AS A OUT OR GOING TO SORRY GENERAL DOG OWNERS AS A WHOLE I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW TO DETTOL EDUCATION OF SENSIBLE DOG OWNERSHIP AND ACTUALLY BEING AWARE THAT TRAIN YOUR DOG TO BE
SOCIABLE WITH OTHER ANIMALS AND OTHER BREEDS AND ALL THE DOGS IN PARTICULAR AND ESPECIALLY TOWARDS ANY SERVICE DOGS THAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE AS WELL AS THAT WE DON'T WANT OBVIOUSLY NOT PEOPLE PROSECUTED WE DEFINITELY WANT PEOPLE TO BE AWARE AND EDUCATED AND HER SHOULD SORT IT SUCH SORT SORT IT SHOWED ME
TO GO TO THAT STAGE THEN I THINK IT SHOULD IT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT OH K. AM ARTIST STAMMER LINE BECAUSE WE HAVE A DISTRICT JUDGE ALSO JOINING US RICHARD WILLIAMS AS A MEMBER OF THE SENTENCING COUNCILLORS ARE SENSING COUNSEL AND ADVISE THIS CHANGE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MINDS AS A COUNCIL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DECIDED TO CHANGE IT AND ASK FOR THE CHANGE
WE ORIGINALLY ISSUED GUIDELINES IN RELATION TO OFFENCES INVOLVING DOGS DANGEROUSLY OUT OF CONTROL IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT THE LEGISLATION CHANGED WITH THE FAKE FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY KRIS THE MAXIMUM JAIL SENTENCE AND ALSO TO EXTEND THE OFFENCE NOT ONLY TO COVER AN E. PROM A PUBLIC PLACE BUT ALSO
SO THAT THE LAW CLYDE IN PRIVATE BRILLIANT PREMISES ALSO AND THE LEGISLATURE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT SITUATION TO INTRODUCE THE SPECIFIC OFFENCE OF
OF A DOG DANGEROUSLY OUT OF CONTROL WHERE AN ASSISTANCE DOG HE'S KILLED OR INJURED BUT AND THE CHANGE NOW IS THAT YOU COULD GET A HARSHER SENTENCE IF IF IT APPEARS THAT YOU'VE TRAINED THE DOG SPECIFICALLY TRAINED YOUR DOG TO BE AGGRESSIVE
THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH WOULD PLACE AN OFFENDER IN THE HIGHER CULPABILITY RANGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SENTENCE AND HOW MUCH WOULD THAT INCREASE THE SENTENCE WILL IT DEPENDS ON THE OTHER FACTORS IN THEIR CASE I KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE RANGE THERE THAT WE'RE LOOKING
WELL IN TERMS OF A DOG DANGEROUSLY OUT OF CONTROL CAUSING A FATALITY SO A FRATERNITY TO A HUMAN THE HIGHEST CULPABILITY STARTING POINT IS EIGHT YEARS WITH A CENSUS IN RANGE OF BETWEEN SIX AND FOURTEEN YEARS
THAT'S A CHANGE FROM WHAT WHAT THE MAXIMUM WAS TWO ALL RIGHT O.K. SAID SO IT'S A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE YES AND AND YOU
ASK FOR THAT CHANGE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE A REAL IMPACT WHAT DID THE SAME TO THINK I WASN'T DIDN'T ASK FOR A CHANGE IN THE LAW THE SENSING COUNCIL RESPONDS TO CHANGES TO THE LAW BROUGHT ABOUT BY PARLIAMENT
SO WE HAVE TO REVISE OUR GUIDELINES TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT THE MAXIMUM PENALTY HAS UNDERGONE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE YES I SAY BUT IT'S THE MORAL WEIGHT THEN OF THE THE DEGREE OF OPPROBRIUM THAT YOU WOULD ATTACH TO A PARTICULAR OFFENCE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED
THERE ARE TWO DIMENSIONS TO IT THERE'S THE CULPABILITY OF THE OFFENDER AND THE HARM THAT'S CAUSED AS A RESULT OF THE OFFENCE AND HE'D SAY BALANCING EXERCISE TAKING ACCOUNT OF EACH OF THOSE FEATURES WHICH LEADS THE SENTENCE HAD TO FORM A VIEW AS TO THE RELEVANT STARTING POINT SO FAR AS THAT SPECIFIC OFFENCE IS CONCERNED
DISTRICT JUDGE RICHARD WENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW TWENTY FIVE PAST SEVEN HE WAS GARY WITH THE SPORT JOHN JUSTIN GOOD MORNING TO YOU BARCELONA THREE ARSENAL WON ARSENAL ARE OUT OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ARSENAL MANAGER ARSENE WENGER WAS FULL OF PRAISE FOR BARCELONA'S GOALSCORERS NAME A SOIREE SOIREES MESSY

THANK YOU TIME TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT LABOUR SAYS AUSTERITY AS A POLITICAL CHOICE AND ONE THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO MAKE GROWTH AND FAIRER TAXES CAN DO THE JOB OF BALANCING THE BOOKS AND ON CURRENT SPENDING AS OPPOSED TO LONGER TERM CAPITAL SPENDING BALANCING THE BOOKS IS WHAT LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO DOING THEY'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE PILE OF DEBT WHICH AT THE MOMENT OF COURSE IS RISING SO HOW REALISTIC ARE LABOUR'S PLANS JOHN MCDONNELL AS THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING MORNING AND ON THE CURRENT
A COUNT WOULD TALK ABOUT CAPITAL SPENDING A MOMENT ON THE CURRENT ACCOUNT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS QUITE A DEFICIT THIRTY NINE BILLION POUNDS HOW WOULD YOU FIX THAT WHILE WE WERE DOING WE WERE REVERSE THE TAX CUTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN TO CORPORATIONS UNTO THE RICHEST IN OUR SOCIETY BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WHAT WE WOULD DO WAS WERE WE WOULD REVIEW ALL EXPENDITURE WOULD GO BACK TO ZERO BASED BUDGETING THERE IN ADDITION TO THAT WHAT WE WOULD DO IS INVEST IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THE WAY IN WHICH IS A BIT OF HOLIDAY WON'T FIX HER CURRENT HELP WILL IT
YOU'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT IT WELL WHAT IT WILL IF YOU WANT TO START INVESTING IN THE ECONOMY TOOK AROUND SKILLS INFRASTRUCTURE NEW TECHNOLOGY WHO GROW THE ECONOMY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE YEAR THAT YOU INVEST COSTUME I WON'T GET ON I THINK THAT'S WHY WE LOST HER THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING OVER A LIFETIME OF FIVE YEARS OF LABOUR GOVERNMENT WE WOULD BE REDUCING OVERALL THE DEFICIT AND ELIMINATING IT IN DUE COURSE AND ALSO REDUCING THE DAY IF YOU HAVE YOU SIR JUST ABSOLUTELY YOU'D BE WILLING THEN TO INCREASE EXPENDITURE
INITIALLY IN ORDER TO COPE AND I'M TALKING JUST ABOUT THAT THAT CURRENT ACCOUNT GAP AT THE MOMENT IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THAT YOU WOULD INCREASE AND WE WOULD INVEST WE WOULD HE WOULD INCREASE EXPEND THAT MEANS BORROWING IN THE LONG TERM TO INVEST AT THAT END SIR ENSURE THAT YOU BALANCE THE BOAT WOULD BORROW MORE MIGHT IT IS EXACTLY LIKE REDS THAT CAROL COUNT GO LET'S TAKE THE EXCESS TAKE BREAD I JUST ON THAT YES OR NO YOU WOULD BORROW MORE MONEY TO DO YES REWARD BECAUSE JUST LIKE A PRIVATE COMPANY U.K. P.L.C.
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU INVEST YOU BORROW THE MONEY TO INVEST INVEST IN THE PLANT AND MACHINERY YOU MAKE YOURSELF MORE COMPETITIVE AND AS A RESULT OF THAT YOU GROW YOUR BUSINESS AND WE DO EXACTLY THE SAME WITH OUR WITH OUR ECONOMY BUT BUT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT CURRENT
GAD THAT THAT'S AT THAT DEFICIT ON THE CURRENT BUDGET COULD BE BROUGHT TO ZERO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A UNDER A FISCAL RULE WE WOULD GROW THE ECONOMY WE'D HAVE A FAIR TAXATION SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THAT WE ELIMINATE THE DEFICIT OVER ROLLING FIVE YEAR PROGRAMME AND THEN TITIAN TO THAT WE'VE BEEN THAT WE'D HAVE THE ADDITIONAL DISCIPLINE THAT WE WOULD REDUCE THE DEBT WHEN JUDY P. WITHIN THAT FIVE YEAR WOULD YOU CUT SPENDING AT ALL WE'D REVIEW EVERY ITEM OF EXPENDITURE WOULD YOU CUT IT OUT AND LET ME JUST
INTO A AS WE WOULD REVIEW EVERY ITEM OF EXPENDITURE TO MAKE SURE IT'S OFFICIALLY EFFECTIVELY SPENT BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE AUSTERITY CUTS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING FORWARD A NECESSARY OR TO BE FRANK A FAIR YESTERDAY
WE MADE THE POINT THAT IT AUSTERITY IS NOT AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY IT'S A POLITICAL CHOICE YESTERDAY THE CHANCELLOR MADE HIS POLITICAL CHOICES HE CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO THE RICHEST FIVE PERCENT OF OUR COUNTRY AND ICH HATTE THEIR DISABILITY BENEFITS TO SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN ANSWER SAID YOU WERE REVERSE BOTH OF THEM WE WOULD WE WOULD REVERSE THEM YES WE WOULD BECAUSE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CUT TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH LAST WEEK
WE HAD THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY THE PARKINSON'S SOCIETY DISABILITY RIGHTS ALL OF THOSE WHO THOUGHT WE HAD A SETTLED PERSONAL AND INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT AGREEMENT THE GOVERNMENT SHIFT OF THE GOALPOST SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DISABLED PEOPLE WILL LOSE UP TO OVER ONE HUNDRED POUNDS IT'S SIZEABLE SUM OF MONEY IN THE PUBLIC FINANCES TOO ISN'T IT FOUR BILLION OR SO OVER THE PARLIAMENT YES WHERE YOUR MONEY USE THAT MONEY TO CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND TO CUT CORPORATION TAX
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF YESTERDAY'S BUDGET AND AS I SAY HE'S MADE A POLITICAL CHOICE YESTERDAY'S PUT THE INTERESTS OF THE RICHEST IN THIS COUNTRY IN ADVANCE OF THOSE WERE MOST VULNERABLE THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANALYSIS UP UNTIL THIS WEEKEND DEMONSTRATED IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY IN WHICH TAX CUTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE WAY WHICH
SERVICE CUTS HAVE BEEN MADE THEM THE HEAVIEST BURDEN IS FALLING ON THE PORCH WITH A SOCIETY MIDDLE IN LOW EARNERS AS WELL IT'S WOMEN IN PARTICULAR EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE CUTS OF FAWN ISN'T A FUNDAMENTAL UNREALITY OF ALL THAT THERE THAT ACTUALLY THAT THE CHANGES THAT HE'S MAKING TO CORPORATION TAX GOING TO BRING A WHOLE LOT MORE CORPORATION TAX AND IF YOU SIMPLY GOT RID OF THEM YOU WOULD BE GETTING RID OF FOR INSTANCE THE ABOLITION OF ALL SORTS OF LOOPHOLES THAT HE IS GOING TO ABOLISH ALL BE IN THE LAST
HERE ARE TWO OF THE PARLIAMENT SO I MEAN IT IS UNREALISTIC ISN'T IT SIMPLY TO SAY WE WOULD PAY FOR THOSE DISABILITY CUTS WE RESTORE ALL OF THAT BY NOT DOING WHAT HE'S DOING OF CORPORATE THAT'S WAS ACTUALLY WHAT DETAINED THAT'S AND TAXES BRING THOSE SHOULDN'T TAKE EXAMPLE LIKE
HE'S CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX THAT GOES TO THE RICHEST FIVE PERCENT IN SOCIETY WHO'S PAID FOR IT THE MOST VULNERABLE DECIDES LIKE I MUST HAVE THAT THOUGH IF YOU WERE FIRST JUST THAT CAPITAL GAINS TAX YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE UP FOR THAT FOR BED GOES IT WAS GO TO CONSIDERABLE WAY TOWARDS THE CUTS IN DISABILITY ALLOWANCES THAT WERE TAKEN NEXT WEEK SO YOU THINK THE WHOA MATCHES THE UP
GO SOME WAY TOWARDS THAT BUT IF YOU INCLUDE THE CUTS IN CORPORATION TAX AND WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN YOU BRING IN MORE MONEY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BUT AT THE END OF THAT SIDE NO CUT SIGNAL FEMALE BUT DOESN'T BRING IT IN WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT IS CORPORATIONS ARE HAVING THEIR TAXES CUT AND THEY'RE SITTING NOW ON UNEARNED INCOME ANYTHING BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION ARE NOT INVESTING IN OUR ECONOMY I JUST THINK NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET A BALANCE WHEN A COMET AND THAT BOUNCER'S GOT TO BE BASED ON FAIRNESS
CALLED WAS ASKED IN THE COMMONS YESTERDAY AFTER HE'D SAT DOWN BY CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANDREW RETIRED CHERUB THE TREASURY COMMITTED AND YOUR TOES HAD IN A CAPITALIST ECONOMY PROPERLY REGULATED IS THE MOST POWERFUL SOURCE OF PROSPERITY AND GROWTH DO YOU AGREE
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THE CAP TO SOCIETY THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE SHOULD BE JUDGE OF AUNT CONNIE WHAT WE WANT YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT I STICK ON THAT PROPERLY REGULATE WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO RESHAPE OUR ECONOMY AND TRANSFORM IT IN A WAY IN WHICH FIRST OF ALL IT'S MORE PRODUCTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT
AND ALSO IT'S FAIR SHALL WE SHARE THE PROSPERITY NOW WE LIVE WITH IT IN A CAPITALIST BUT THE HIS POINT SURELY RETIREES POINT AND HE MADE THIS POINT ABOUT TONY BLAIR AND JOHN SMITH AND OTHER LABOUR LEADERS HE SAID THEY HAD ACCEPTED FUNDAMENTALLY THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS MAKE CAPITALISM WORK WELL IS THAT STILL YOUR ONLY TRANSFORMING CAPITALISM IN FRONT OF US BUT NOT GOING TO SOMETHING OUT YES INTO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE DEMOCRATIC IN MORE EQUAL UNFAIR OR SHALL WE SHARE IN THE PROSPERITY
THOSE TRANSFORMATIONS COME AS A RESULT OF FOR EXAMPLE HOW WE MANAGE OUR ECONOMY HOW WE INVEST IN OUR ECONOMY BUT ALSO HOW WE RESTRUCTURE OUR ECONOMY SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN A COMPANY IS MAKING PROFITS THAT THEY SHARE THE PROFIT MORE EQUALLY AND THAT PROSPERITY THEN HE SHARED THROUGHOUT SOCIETY GEORGE OSBORNE WANTS
TOTAL SPENDING FROM THE STATE TO BE THIRTY SIX PER CENT OF JEELY PIECE VERY PRECISE ABOUT THAT NUMBER AND YOU SUDDENLY BROUGHT IT DOWN TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO THAT IT WAS ABOVE FORTY WHAT WOULD YOUR TARGET BE AS CHANCELLOR BUT WE WOULD DEVELOP THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN A WAY IN WHICH TO HAVE OUTSIDE ECONOMY EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY SO WHAT WOULD THAT BE IT WILL BE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT WORKS
AND WE WILL DEVELOP OUR POLICIES ON THE BASIS OF A CONSIDERATION OF ACTUALLY WHAT WORD IS LIGHT IT MIGHT IT ALSO BE THIRTY SIX PERCENT LIKE THE TIME MY VIEW IS IT WILL DEVELOP THIS STATE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT WE NEED AND THE WAY IN WHICH WILL DEVELOP INTERESTING THOUGH THAT YOU WOULD COME UP WITH A FIGURE DON'T I TELL YOU WHAT I WHAT I THINK THE STATE SENATE SIX PER CENT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE A FIGURE LIKE THAT WHAT THEN HAPPENS YOU SET YOURSELF IT AS HE HAS DONE IN FISCAL RULES
EITHER YOU FAIL TO MEET OR FAIL TO MAKE THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY WILL DESIGN ARE ENTREPRENEURIAL STATE IN A WAY IN WHICH IT MEANS IT INTERVENES IN THE ECONOMY EFFECTIVELY NOW WE'LL DESIGN ON THE BASE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE WEALTH CREATORS AND WHO HAVE THAT THAN THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT THE BUSINESSES THE ENTREPRENEURS AND THE WORKERS THEMSELVES AND IN THAT WAY WE WON'T COME TO IT WITH THIS SORT OF AGE ARE LOGICAL COMMITTING TO SHRINK THE STATE BECAUSE THE REASON HE'S DOING THAT
IS BECAUSE WHATEVER REPORTER IT EITHER ALTHOUGH TRIP WON'T WE WON'T HAVE AN AIDE ILLOGICAL WILMA TO RAISE THEIR SHARE OF THE HOLD THE WHOLE POINT THE WHOLE POINT THAT'S HOW WE REDESIGNED THE STATE IS TO MAKE IT FIT FOR PURPOSE AND AS SOON AS YOU SAID GET YOURSELF INTO MY HOUSE HE'S DONE ON THE FISCAL RULES TO BE FRANK YOU FRAME IT IN A WAY WHICH WERE BOUND TO FAIL JOHN ARE DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WILL BE TOLD AT THE CHANCEL HIMSELF AT TEN PAST EIGHT THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO MUSTER MUCH EXCITEMENT FOR THE BUDGET THE FINANCIAL TIMES DESCRIBED AS DEFENSIVE BUT POLITICALLY SAVVY SUMS UP THE GENERAL MODE FOR THE TELEGRAPH IT IS MUCH HARDER THAN IT SEEMS TO DELIVER AN UNDERSTATED UNCONTROVERSIAL SPEECH ON THAT ME COME TO BE SEEN AS YESTERDAY'S PRINCIPAL SUCCESS
THE INDEPENDENT THINGS GEORGE OSBORNE'S TAX BREAKS FOR THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASSES COULD BE RELATED TO THE FORTHCOMING ELECTIONS A REFERENDUM AND SUGGEST WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS FROM THIS NOTORIOUSLY POLITICAL CHANCELLOR THE DAILY MAIL IS MORE POSITIVE USES HIS EDITORIAL TO COMMEND A FINE BUDGET MARRED BY THE DREAD D. WORD DEBT THE TIMES ALSO GIVES GEORGE OSBORNE CREDIT BELIEVING HE IS ONE LITTLE RUNNY HAD MANOEUVRE WELL BUT THE EXPRESS CRITICISES THE CHANCELLOR'S PRO E.U. COMMENTS ARGUING THAT HE SHOULD
TAKE A DAY OFF FROM HIS ROLE AS BRUSSELS CHEERLEADER AND STUCK TO THE TASK AT HAND AND THE GUARDIAN IS ALSO UNIMPRESSED VIEWING YESTERDAY AS A GRIM DAY FOR MISTER OSBORNE WHO IT SAYS COMES AWAY WITH HIS ONCE FORMIDABLE REPUTATION BADLY DAMAGED THE SUN AND THE MIRROR UNLIKELY BEDFELLOWS BUT THE CHANCELLOR HE'S SAVAGED BY BOTH OF THEM THIS MORNING THE SUGAR TAX AS A BULK BUY MULTI PACK OF FULL FAT COBBLERS ACCORDING TO THE SUN TO ARGUE THAT SOLD EFFECT WILL BE TO MAKE ITS READERS SHOPPING MORE EXPENSIVE
THE MURDERS THAT INSCRIBED THE POLICY POLICIES A SWEET VICTORY BUT IT DOES GO ON TO ACCUSED GEORGE OSBORNE OF A STRING OF EXPENSIVE ECONOMIC FAILURES SO THE BRITONS ARE STILL WAITING WORKING BRITONS ARE STILL WAITING FOR A CHANCELLOR TO DELIVER PROSPERITY AND OF THE TIMES CUT IS PETER BROOK'S GIVES HIS TAKE ON THE BUDGET BY SKETCHING A CAN OF FIZZY DRINK COLD OSBORNE KNEW SUGAR FREE IT SAYS ON THE SIDE REDUCES GROWTH TO ZERO
UNDER THE HEADLINE A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR TAX THE INDEPENDENT STAV BROWN DEPICTS THE CHANCELLOR OFFERING A SUITE NOW WITH ONE HAND BUT CONCEALING A TOXIC MEDICINE BOTTLE BEHIND HIS BACK WITH THE OTHER FOR THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ADAMS DRAWS ON GEORGE OSBORNE'S POLITICAL AMBITION THAT CHANCELLOR SHOWN ANNOUNCING THIS BUDGET IS ALL ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION WELL IMAGINING HIMSELF STANDING OUTSIDE TEN DOWNING STREET AS PRIME MINISTER
TICKET HOLDERS FOR A FORTHCOMING PRODUCTION AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE HAVE DEMANDED THEIR MONEY BACK ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH ON AN EMAIL WARNING OF VIOLENCE AND SEX ACTS ON STAGE MORE THAN HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE CONTACTED OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS THE RISKY AND GORY SCENES IN AND DID YOU GIVE ME THE ELEVEN OR MORE THE OPERA HOUSE'S TILL THE TELEGRAPH THE SEXES CON CENTRAL AND THE VIOLENCE IS INTEGRAL TO THE STORY SPITE OF CONCERN CONCERNS TICKET SALES

RICH AND POOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL LIFE YOU KNOW IT IS A GOOD TIME TO LOOK BACK AND TO CELEBRATE CELEBRATED MANY ACHIEVEMENT INDEED AND HE DID HE WAS YOU COULD SAY COULDN'T DO THAT HE DEFINED THE ROLE OF NEWS AND CURRENT AFFAIRS PRESENTER I THINK WHEN YOU THINK OF THIS FOR THE TONIGHT PROGRAMME STARTING IN THAT IN THERE
HE REALLY HAD A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER AND THERE WAS NO MODEL ON WHICH TO BAKE IT AND COMING OUT OF THEM WE USE WE WORE DINNER JACKET YOU BEFORE
AND THAT'S REALLY THE MODEL
THAT ABSOLUTELY AND EGGY YOU SORT OF THOUGHT OF HIM ALMOST AS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY I MEAN HE WAS THE MEMBER OF THE EXTENDED FAMILY

HE WOULD HAVE REALLY STRONG FAMILY MAN TO MY SISTER JENNY AND I KNOW WE HAD A SURPRISINGLY NORMAL UPBRINGING AND GIVEN THE LEVEL OF FAME WHICH HE HAD AND THAT WAS ALL
AND HE WAS STILL DRIVING TO THE SUPERMARKET JUST SIX WEEKS AGO I THOUGHT HE WAS STILL DRIVING AWAY PROBE AND EVEN THE SUPER SAVER BOYS SITTING UP IN BED READING THE NEWSPAPER AND TELLING ME WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF
IN MANY RESPECTS IT'S AN OLD AGE WHICH WE
BUT IT WOULDN'T WE JUST HAD A WONDERFUL LIFE GUYS THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US IT WELCOME JOHN THANK YOU THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HERE WITH US THIS MORNING IS FRANCIS CAMPBELL AS VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON MORNING PAT GOOD MORNING TRUST AND GOOD MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING ALL AND A HAPPY SAINT PATRICK'S DAY
THIS YEAR A CELEBRATION MAYBE SOMEWHAT SPECIAL FOR LATER THIS MONTH IRELAND WILL MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE NINETEEN SIXTEEN RISING WHICH SET OFF A CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADING TO THE PETITION OF OUR LONDON NINETEEN TWENTY TWO
SAINT PATRICK'S DAY HAS BECOME A NATIONAL CELEBRATION PERHAPS MORE AND I FAMED FOR PARTYING THEN EXAMPLE AND FIERCE BUT SAINT PATRICK STORY IS MORE THAN JUST HAVING A GOOD PARTY THE ONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY CONTRADICT THE OTHER IN IRISH LIFE JUST THINK OF THE WAY
PATRICK GIVES A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW THE FAITH OF ONE PERSON CAN OVERCOME HUMAN WEAKNESS AND ALTER THE COURSE OF HISTORY
PATRICK PROBABLY A YOUNG BRITON WAS KIDNAPPED IN THE FIFTH CENTURY AND SLAVED AND IRELAND AS A SHEPHERD BOY BEFORE ESCAPING AND RETURNING TO HIS FAMILY
BUT HE DIDN'T HIT THE IRISH OR SEEK REVENGE FOR WHAT THEY DID RATHER HE LATER RETURNED TO CONVERT THEM TO THE CHRISTIAN FAITH HAS EXAMPLE AS WORTH REMEMBERING BECAUSE FOR MANY TODAY RELIGION ARE SEEN NOT AS A MEANS OF LIBERATION FROM HUMAN ILLS NOR MESSAGE OF SALVATION LOVER FORGIVENESS SOME TURN IT INTO A VEHICLE OF TEMPORAL REVENGE FOR INJUSTICES BOTH REAL AND PRISSY
PATRICK'S RETURNED TO IRELAND WAS NOT AS A LEADER OF ARMIES TO RIGHT OR WRONG RATHER HIS RETURN WAS WITH THE SIMPLE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL AND ONE THAT SPREAD BECAUSE OF HOW HE LIVED
HE SOUGHT OUT HIS CAPTORS NOT TO KILL THEM BUT TO INSPIRE THEM TO LEAD BETTER LIVES AND HE DID SO BY PERSUASION AND EXAMPLE NOT COERCION
AND PATRICK'S MESSAGE IS THAT YOU JUST DON'T LEARN A FIERCE BUT YOU LOVE IT YOU TEACHER NOT SIMPLY THROUGH WORDS ARE BOOKS BUT THROUGH ACTIONS AND YOU DO SO NOT JUST WHEN IT IS EASY BUT WHEN IT IS MOST HUMANLY DIFFICULT
IN RECENT CENTURIES IT'S NOT ALWAYS BEEN EASY FOR THAT MESSAGE TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE COMPETING POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES AND NATIONAL IDENTITIES WHICH HAVE GRIPPED THE ISLAND OF IRELAND
AS IRELAND NORTH AND SOUTH MIXER TO RECONCILIATION WITH ITS PAST CENTURY OF DIVISIONS AND FIERCE IT CAN REFLECT ON SOME PATRICK'S EXAMPLE NEARLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEARS ON
HE STILL SHOWS US HOW IT IS NOT HATRED REVENGE A CAUTION WHICH CONVERTS HUMAN HEARTS BUT LOVE AND PEACE HAPPY SAINT PATRICK'S DAY
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE FRANCIS CAMPBELL THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON THE TIME TEN TO EIGHT EUROPE'S LEADERS BEGIN ANOTHER MEETING TODAY TO TRY TO FIND AN ANSWER TO THE REFUGEE CRISIS WHICH SOMEBODY THREATENS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE TABLE IS THE PLAN DISCUSSED BETWEEN GERMANY AND TURKEY TEN DAYS AGO HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL PLAN PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ONE PROPOSAL FOR EVERY LEGAL MIGRANT TO ARRIVE FROM SYRIA AN ILLEGAL WHO'D ALREADY MADE IT
WOULD BE SENT BACK APART FROM THE SHIA PRACTICALITY HOBBIT MANY SAY IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LEGAL LET'S TALK ABOUT BOTH THOSE ASPECTS I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR CATHERINE COST ELLEN'S PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFUGEE LORD OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND HERE IN THE STUDIO TURNING A STEEL WHO'S THE INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT SAVE THE CHILDREN TANYA STEAL THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM THA'S GIVE AN IDEA OF AN IDEA OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AS WE SPEAK
I WAS IN IT ARE MANY CAMP EARLIER ON THIS WHEN HE'S ON THE BORDER BETWEEN MACEDONIA AND THAT'S RIGHT AND THERE ARE LITERALLY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TRAPPED BY THE BORDER WHO HAD HOPED TO CROSS AND THEIR CONDITIONS ARE UNIMAGINABLE THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY A SEA OF MUD THEY ARE LIVING IN MAKESHIFT TENTS THERE ARE FOOD SHORTAGES WE'VE SEEN PICTURES OF WOMEN BATHING THEIR CHILDREN IN PUDDLES
THEY HAD GIVING BIRTH IN FLOODED TENTS AND THE RISE OF CHILDREN'S RESPIRATORY DISEASES IS REALLY QUITE SHOCKING BECAUSE QUITE LITERALLY PEOPLE ARE BURNING ANYTHING PLASTIC TRASH AS WELL AS WOOD JUST TO STAY WARM IT IS ABSOLUTELY FREEZING AND THE PRACTICALITY OF MOVING THEM UNDER THE SORT OF DEAL THAT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN A CHANCELLOR MERKEL AND AT THE TURKISH PRIME MINISTER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
I MEAN WE ARE HORRIFIED BY THE TWISTED LOGIC OF A PROPOSED DEAL THAT
REQUIRES ONE PERSON TO EFFECTIVELY RISK THEIR LIFE AT SEA HAVING FLED A TERRIBLE CONFLICT IN ORDER FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO POTENTIALLY BE GIVEN SAFE AND LEGAL PASSAGE TO EUROPE AND PRACTICALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON THE GROUND BY FAR THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARRIVING ON EUROPEAN SHORES OF FLEEING CONFLICT ZONES SO THEREFORE THEY'RE ENTITLED OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION TO
ERE I'M ALLOWED TO STAY ON THE COUNTRY THE LAND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY LAND MOPE MOST DEFINITELY WE WOULD EXPECT AND HOPE AND CALL FOR THESE PEOPLE'S CASES FOR ASYLUM TO BE HEARD AND WORRYINGLY FORTY PER CENT OF ARRIVALS ARE CHILDREN AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEIR ASYLUM CASES COULD BE HEARD BECAUSE QUITE LITERALLY THE PLACES THEY HAVE LEFT ARE
UTTERLY SHOCKING I HAVE NEVER MET A SYRIAN FAMILY OVER THE MANY MANY YEARS OF CONFLICT FOR EVER WANTED TO LEAVE SYRIA IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY HAVE ONLY LEFT WHEN THEY HAVE QUITE LITERALLY LOST EVERYTHING AND THIS IS WHERE THEIR JOURNEY HAS ENDED AND DOCTOR COSTELLO THE LEGAL PRACTICALITIES OF THIS THERE IS IT WOULD IT BE LEGAL TO SEND SOMEBODY BACK PURELY BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE WHO HAS ARRIVED AT LEGALLY THAT IS NOW
THAT ASPECTS OF THE DEAL THIS ONE FOR ONE ASPECT IT'S OBVIOUSLY DEEPLY ETHICALLY TROUBLING UGLY BUT LEGALLY I THINK SENDING ANYBODY BACK TO TURKEY I MEAN YOU DESCRIBED THEM AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WE KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REFUGEES
IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RETURNING REFUGEES VARIOUS IT'S ONLY PERMISSIBLE UNDER VERY VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES IF THE REFUGEES ENJOY FOR THE PROTECTION IN THE COUNTRY TO WHICH THEY WOULD BE RETURNED AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND AT STATEMENT YESTERDAY OUTLINE VERY CLEARLY THAT IF THAT WERE TO BE DONE TURKEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHANGED US BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT OFFERS PROTECTION TO SYRIANS
IT'S QUITE A FLIMSY SORT OF TEMPORARY STATUS AND FOR A NUN SYRIANS AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT RETURNING AFGHANS IRAQIS THEY DON'T ENJOY AREN'T FORMAL STATUS THAT'S SO IT'S YOU KNOW IF IT WERE TO BE LEGALLY WOULD REQUIRE VERY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHANGES BOTH IN TURKEY AND INCREASE I'LL BE PROCEDURAL SITE TO STATE THE OBVIOUS YOU CANNOT RETURN TO SYRIA
KNOWING THAT IF YOU DID THEY MIGHT VERY WELL BE BLOWN TO BITS THE NEXT DAY ABSOLUTELY I MEAN RETURN TO SYRIA AND OTHER WARATAH IN COUNTRIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS LIVES WOULD BE AT RISK AMOUNTS TO REFUTE AMAR AND THAT'S AS ARE SACROSANCT PRINCIPLE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT RETURNING PEOPLE TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY WOULD BE PERSECUTED OR SUBJECT TO SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF EMPEROR MESS ABOUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT PUT THIS TO BOTH OF YOU
THIS THIS DETERS PEOPLE FROM MAKING THAT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS JOURNEY ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM TURKEY TO GREECE THEY MIGHT VERY WELL DIED DURING THE MAKING OF THAT JOURNEY IF IT DETERS THEM FROM DOING THAT ISN'T IT A GOOD THING
I MEAN I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IF WE LOOK AT THE SHEER SCALE OF THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE ALREADY FLED THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA AND OUR VIEW IS THAT THEY WILL ONLY TAKE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS ROUTES IN ORDER TO TRY AND REACH SOME FORM OF SANCTUARY
QUITE LITERALLY THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BEHIND FOR THEM ANY MORE SO IT IS WORTH A BALANCE OF RISK WHEN IT WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED TO PACK OUT WHAT LITTLE BELONGINGS YOU HAVE PUT YOUR CHILDREN ON YOUR BACKS AND PUT THEM IN A DANGEROUS BOAT ACROSS THE SEA YOU WERE ALREADY A DESPERATE PERSON FLING A VERY VERY DESPERATE SITUATION AND CATHERINE
I THINK THE DETERRENTS LOGIC DOESN'T HOLD WHEN WE'RE REALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO CLOSE DOWN ONE ROUTE WHICH IS THAT THE TURKEY TO GREEK ISLANDS ROUTE THERE ARE THERE MANY MORE DANGEROUS ROUTES LIKE THE CENTRAL MEDITERRANEAN ONE FROM LIBYA TO ITALY AND IF MORE PEOPLE START TAKING THAT BIT MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE WE KNOW IT'S THE DEADLIEST SEA ROUTE IN THE WORLD AND THE SMUGGLERS THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RUTHLESS SO JUST TO ECHO TANYA SENTIMENT I MEAN WE CAN SEE THESE PATTERNS THAT THE DRIVER IS DESPERATION
I THINK THE HOPE IS TO OPEN UP VERY SIGNIFICANT RESETTLEMENT PLACE AS THERE IS A AN INTERNATIONAL SUMMIT BEING CONVENED BY YOU AND H. THEY WERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF MARCH THERE IS AN AUTUMN SUMMAT BEING CONVENED BY OBAMA LINKED TO EFFORTS AT THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND BOTH OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO OPEN UP VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT RESETTLEMENT COMMITMENTS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HOPE
IF THEY STAYED IN TURKEY LEBANON AND JORDAN AND THERE WILL BE A RESETTLEMENT PROSPECT FOR THEM BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE E.U. HAS MANIPULATED THE IDEA OF RESETTLEMENT IN THIS DEAL IT DOESN'T REALLY SUPPORTS THOSE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER SOURCE OF MY CONCERN AND DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THIS APPARENT DEAL
KATHERINE COSTELLO ANTONIO STILL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED BRILLIANT UNDERRATE AND HER JOHN HAMMOND'S HERE WITH OR WHETHER THAT'S JUST TURNED A SUNNY AFTERNOON TO COME FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF US AFTER A RATHER MURKY START IN A FEW PLACES WITH SOME THICK PATCHES OF FOG ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN ENGLAND THE NORFOLK SUFFOLK CAMBRIDGESHIRE INTO THE EAST MIDLANDS THAT WILL LIFT AS WILL THE CLOUD FURTHER WEST ACROSS THE MIDLANDS AND THE THROUGH WALES IT'S ALSO QUITE CLOUDY AND MISTY ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH EAST ENGLAND AT THE MOMENT BUT ALL THESE AREAS WILL SEE THE CLOUD DISSOLVING AWAY
OTHER PLACES WHICH ARE WAKING UP TO SUNSHINE WILL STAY SUNNY SO EVERYWHERE BASICALLY BY THE AFTERNOON WILL SEE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF SOME NORTH EASTERN COASTAL FRINGES OF ENGLAND WELCOME TINCEY COW COMING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA KEEPING IT COOL HERE AT SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES BUT FOR THE REST OF US IN THE SUNSHINE IT WILL FEEL A BIT MORE LIKE IT UP INTO DOUBLE FIGURES AND A GOOD FEW PLACES THAT CHILLY BREEZE ACROSS SOUTHERN COUNTIES WON'T BE SO EVIDENT
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AGAIN A FINE AFTERNOON TO COME AFTER A RATHER CLOUDY START IN SOME PLACES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THE CLOUD WILL RADLEY BREAK UP WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE I THINK THE LOW CLOUD WHICH IS DRIFTING THROUGH THE CENTRE ABOUT A SCOTLAND MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELUCTANT TO CLEAR PETITE SHOULD RETREAT TO EASTERN COASTAL AREAS OF SCOTLAND WHERE IT WILL STAY QUITE GREY AND CHILLY I THINK SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES BUT FOR THE REST OF SCOTLAND WILL SEE INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE PARTICULARLY OUT WEST INTO TEMPERATURES WILL RESPOND UP INTO THE MID TEENS ACROSS PARTS OF THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS AGAIN
MORE LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEGREES TYPICALLY CLOUDIER DAY TOMORROW FOR MANY OF US THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE IN THE WEST BUT STAYS DRIES IT WILL BE THROUGH THE WEEKEND ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE DISAPPOINTINGLY CLOUDY AT TIMES AS WELL THANK YOU JOHN NEXT WEEK GRACE DENT PRESENTS MORE REAL LIFE STORIES FROM AROUND THE U.K.
ONCE I WAS PUT UP IN THAT NORMAL AND JUST WORKING HARD TO GET BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF HOLIDAYS UNHEARD AND UNSEEN
WHEN I TALK TO KEEP FROM NOW IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT'S ME IT FEELS LIKE I'M PRETENDING I'M HOMELESS ONE PLANE
UNTOLD STORIES OF MODERN BRITAIN HOPEFULLY NEXT TIME I COME DOWN YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN FRONT DOOR KEY HOPEFULLY CAN'T GET HAVE THEY GIVE TILL COFFEE AT THE UNTOLD CONTINUES NEXT MONDAY MORNING
AND YOU CAN HEAR THE SERIES SO FAR ON THE B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WEBSITE
THEY'VE GOT THIS PROGRAMME WAS THAT A METEOR STREAKING ACROSS BRITAIN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING WE'LL TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF TEACHING MATH SOME SAY THERE ISN'T ANY AND THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JOHN HUMPHRYS AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE CHANCELLOR HAS REJECTED SUGGESTIONS THAT THERE MAY HAVE TO BE MORE TAX RISES OR SPENDING CUTS IF HE WANTS TO ELIMINATE THE DEFICIT BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT
E.U. LEADERS INCLUDING DAVID CAMERON A MEETING IN BRUSSELS TO DISCUSS THE MIGRANT CRISIS AND ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF B.B.C. TELEVISION NEWS CLIFF MITCHELL MORE HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY SIX THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR HAS REJECTED SUGGESTIONS HE WILL HAVE TO RAISE TAXES OR CUT SPENDING TO MEET HIS TARGET OF A TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT
GEORGE OSBORNE SAID THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY HAD BAGGED HIS VIEW THAT SUCH A TARGET WAS ACHIEVABLE HE ALSO DEFENDED CUTS TO DISABILITY PAYMENTS SAYING THE GOVERNMENT WAS SPENDING A RECORD AMOUNT ON DISABILITY BENEFITS THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL SAID THE DISABLED WERE PAYING FOR CUTS IN CORPORATION TAX HIS ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE CHANCELLOR HAS MADE BALANCING THE BOOKS AND ACHIEVING A SURPLUS BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT HIS CENTRAL ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE BUT THERE ARE THIS MORNING MOUNTING QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER HE CAN MEET THIS TARGET THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY HAS WARNED THE CHANCE OF SUCCESS IS LITTLE BETTER THAN FIFTY FIFTY
MISTER OSBORNE SUMS ARE ALSO BASED ON A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN THE NATION'S FINANCES IN THE LAST YEAR OF THIS PARLIAMENT MOVING FROM A TWENTY BILLION POUND DEFICIT TO A TEN BILLION POUND SURPLUS AND SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES PAUL JOHNSON WARNED ACHIEVING THIS COULD REQUIRE MORE TAX RISES OR SPENDING CUTS
IF THINGS CHANGE AGAIN IF THE O.B. A DOWNGRADES ITS GROWTH FORECASTS AGAIN I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS I THINK YOU WILL BE FORCED TO PUT SOME PROPER TAX INCREASES IN AWE
POSSIBLY EVEN DEFINES SOME YET FURTHER PROPER SPENDING CUTS
SOME ANALYSTS HAVE ALSO CHALLENGED MY OSBORNE'S ASSERTION THAT BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES ARE DUE TO THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN POINTING INSTEAD TO DETERIORATING LEVELS OF PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U.K. AND THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MACDONALD SAID THE BUDGET HAD PUT THE INTERESTS OF THE BETTER OFF HER HEAD AS SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE AUSTERITY CUTS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING FORWARD
NECESSARY OR TO BE FRANK A FAIR AUSTERITY IS NOT AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY IT'S A POLITICAL CHOICE YESTERDAY THE CHANCELLOR MADE HIS POLITICAL CHOICES HE CUT CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO THE RICHEST FIVE PERCENT OF OUR COUNTRY AND HE CUT THE DISABILITY BENEFITS TO SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY
ON THE TORY BENCHES WHILE THERE'S BEEN A BROAD WELCOME FOR MANY OF THE MEASURES PARTICULARLY THOSE AIMED AT MIDDLE INCOME GROUPS THERE IS LINGERING RESENTMENT OVER MISTER OSBORNE'S USE OF THE OBI A REPORT TO BUTTRESS HIS CASE FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. SOME ARE NOW THREATENING TO JOIN LABOUR IN REBELLING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OVER E.U. IMPOSED V. A. T. ON SANITARY PRODUCTS
SPEAKING ON NEWSNIGHT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OBI ARE ROBERT CHOATE SAID HIS ORGANISATION HAD NOT ANALYSE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF BRECHT'S IT ON THE ECONOMY IT HAD QUOTED THE VIEWS OF OTHERS HE INSISTED BUT MADE NO JUDGEMENT ITSELF
DAVID CAMERON WILL TRAVEL TO BRUSSELS FOR A MEETING OF EUROPEAN LEADERS THIS AFTERNOON WEATHER DETAILS OF A PROPOSED DEAL WITH TURKEY TO HOLD THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS IS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE AGENDA THERE ARE SIGNS THE AGREEMENT IS RUNNING INTO DIFFICULTY THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK HAS ADMITTED THE CATALOGUE OF ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE TERMS CAN BE FINALISED HIS LONG FROM BRUSSELS HE'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
THE OUTLINE OF THIS PROPOSED AGREEMENT WAS SPRUNG ON MOST E.U. LEADERS TEN DAYS AGO AFTER BEING COOKED UP BY TURKEY AND GERMANY BUT IN THE LATEST DRAFT OF THE DEAL THE INCENTIVES BEING OFFERED TO THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE FAR LESS CAST IRON THAN IT ONCE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT TURKEY'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP IT WILL BE SPEEDED UP ONLY A COMMITMENT TO PREPARE FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
SECONDLY TURKEY WILL STILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ALL SEVENTY TWO BENCHMARKS THAT THE E.U. HAS SET OUT IF ITS CITIZENS ARE TO ENJOY THESE IF WE TRAVEL TO THE SHOWING AN AREA BY THE END OF JUNE ADD TO ALL THAT CONTINUING CRITICISM OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE IDEA OF RETURNING ALL IRREGULAR MIGRANTS FROM GREECE TO TURKEY AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS SUMMIT HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK STILL TO DO
A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST CARE COMPANIES HAS WON AN OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT FOR BEING PAID LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE CAROLINE BARLOW VISITED CLIENTS IN THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND BUT WAS NOT PAID FOR TIME SPENT TRAVELLING BETWEEN VISITS MY HOME CARE HAS NOW PAID HER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS HER SOLICITORS SAY OTHER WORKERS COULD NOW SUE I HOME CARE SAYS IT'S DISAPPOINTED BY THE LEGAL ACTION SINCE LAST YEAR IT'S CORRECTED CARERS PAY WHERE NECESSARY
A CAMPAIGN IS BEING LAUNCHED TO PERSUADE PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACROSS THE U.K. TO FIND TIME FOR A ONE MILE RUN INTO EACH DAY TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S HEALTH THE DAILY MILE FIRST INTRODUCED AS A SCHOOL IN STIRLING HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PRIMARIES IN SCOTLAND AND SEVERAL OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ABROAD HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE DAILY MILE BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO AT SAINT NINIAN'S PRIMARY SCHOOL IN STIRLING AND IS NOW STRONGLY BACKED BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH A UNIVERSITY STUDY INTO THE EFFECTS OF THE FIFTEEN MINUTE RUN ROUND THE PLAYGROUND HAS YET TO PUBLISH ITS FINDINGS SAINT NINIAN'S FORMER HEAD TEACHER ELAINE WILY CLAIMS ITS REDUCED LEVELS OF OBESITY IMPROVED FITNESS AND BENEFITED SLEEP PATTERNS AND CONCENTRATION IN CLASS
MISSUS WILEY WHO WON LAST YEAR'S PRIDE OF BRITAIN TEACHER OF THE YEAR AWARD FOR COMING UP WITH THE IDEA SAYS SCHOOLS IN SEVERAL ENGLISH COUNTIES AS WELL AS OTHERS IN THE REST OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES ARE COMMITTED TO ADOPTING IT
IN AT LEAST ONE CASE IN WEST CHESHIRE THE GROUP THAT COMMISSIONS HEALTH SERVICES IS HELPING TO SUBSIDISE THE INITIATIVE SAYING THAT IT EXPECTS TO BENEFIT FROM IMPROVED ADULT HEALTH AND LOWER COSTS IN THE FUTURE
A GROUP OF EURO SCEPTIC EM PEASE HAS URGED PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT TO INTERFERE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WHEN HE VISITS THE U.K. NEXT MONTH THEY'VE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER WARNING THE PRESIDENT HE RISKS BEING UNDEMOCRATIC IF HE EXPRESSES SUPPORT FAR EITHER SIDE KEITH DOYLE AND REPORTS
DURING THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM THE PRESIDENT PUBLICLY BACKED A STRONG AND UNITED U.K. AND HE'S ALREADY MADE COMMENTS SEEM TO FAVOUR BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE E.U. NOW PROBE REX HAD M.P.S ARE WORRIED THAT HE MAY WEIGH INTO THE REFERENDUM DEBATE WHEN HE VISITS THE U.K. NEXT MONTH
THE LETTER WHICH HAS BEEN SENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WARNS THE PRESIDENT THAT INTERFERING IN THE ISSUE WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE MILESTONE AT THE END OF HIS TERM IN OFFICE
THE M.P.S INCLUDING KATE HOEY FOR LABOUR AND TORY PETER BONE SAY IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE FOR MISTER OBAMA TO SPEAK OUT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE U.S.
BUT THEY INSIST IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT BRITISH VOTERS ARE ALLOWED TO DECIDE THE REFERENDUM ISSUE FOR THEMSELVES
FRENCH INVESTIGATORS ARE TO VISIT THE BATS A CLONE CONCERT HALL IN PARIS THIS MORNING AS PART OF A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY INTO HOW THE AUTHORITIES HANDLED ATTACKS BY ISLAMIST MILITANTS IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR SURVIVORS OF THE MULTIPLE ATTACKS AND RELATIVES OF SOME OF THE HUNDRED THIRTY VICTIMS HAVE CRITICISED THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE
THE BROADCASTER CLIFF MITCHELL MORE ONE OF THE MOST FAMILIAR FIGURES ON B. B. C. RADIO AND TELEVISION FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF NINETY SIX IN LATER YEARS HE PRESENTED THE HOLIDAY PROGRAMME BUT IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS CAREER HE WAS BEST KNOWN AS THE HOST OF THE CURRENT AFFAIRS PROGRAMME TONIGHT
IF MITCHELL BOYS CREDITED WITH BRINGING A MORE INFORMAL STYLE TO NUDES PRESENTATION AS ILLUSTRATED BY HIS GREAT INTERVIEWERS WHEN HE RESUMED COVERAGE OF THE GENERAL ELECTION RESULT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AFTER VERY LITTLE SLEEP
HOWEVER SOMEBODY THERE WE'RE ALL HERE AGAIN I YOU KNOW THE ROUTINE ONE HUNDRED BUT OVER HERE EITHER I HAVE MADE THEM

HEAD UP AND BOUGHT A CLOCK AND ALL THAT WITH MY BOON COMPANION BURRARD WHO BUDDY BLEEPING
GET BACK WHERE WE WERE
BUT I'M NOT WALKING LEFT NEPHEW AND UP THE STATE APARTMENT QUAD
THE B.B.C.'S DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD HALL SAID CLIFF MITCHELL MOORE WAS ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING BROADCASTERS OF HIS GENERATION GUY MITCHELL MORE HIMSELF A T.V. PRESENTER TOLD US HIS FATHER BROKE NEW GROUND
AND THAT'S REALLY THE MODEL WHICH HE LAY DOWN
ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY AN IRON AGE CEMETERY DISCOVERED ON THE SITE OF A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN EAST YORKSHIRE COULD OFFER EVIDENCE THAT SOME PEOPLE LIVING IN BRITAIN BEFORE THE ROMANS HAD MIGRATED FROM THE CONTINENT THE GRAVES WERE UNCOVERED AT POCKLINGTON AND WILL BE FEATURED IN THE B. B. C. FOUR PROGRAMME TONIGHT NICK HOME REPORT
THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE POCKLINGTON DISCOVERED ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SKELETONS BURIED IN AND AROUND SEVENTY NINE MOUNDS KNOWN AS SQUARE BARROWS THE PEOPLE BELONG TO THE ARRAS CULTURE SO CALLED BECAUSE THEIR GRAVES WERE FIRST DISCOVERED IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY AT ARRAS FORM BETWEEN POCKLINGTON AND BEVERLEY WAS SOME OF THE WARRIORS HAD BEEN BURIED WITH THEIR CHARIOTS
ARCHAEOLOGISTS FOUND NO CHARIOTS AT THE NEW SITE BUT THEY DID FIND A SWORD A SHIELD BOSS SPEARS ROACHES BEADS AND POTS AND THEY'RE EXCITED BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF SKELETONS MEANS IT'S POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE POPULATION IN DETAIL AND WELL MOST OF THE BURIALS ARE PRE ROMAN SUMMER ANGLO SAXON
THE ARCHAEOLOGIST IN CHARGE OF THE DIG SAYS D.N.A. ANALYSIS COULD ESTABLISH IF THE EARLIER AND LATER SKELETONS ARE RELATED WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST THE ARRAS CULTURE PEOPLE LIKE THE LATER ANGLO SAXONS WERE MIGRANTS FROM CONTINENTAL EUROPE
NICK HYAM REPORTING THAT TEN PAST EIGHT EVERY BUDGET HE'S DIFFERENT IN ITS DETAIL BUT THEY ALL TEND TO FOLLOW MUCH THE SAME PREDICTABLE PATH AT LEAST THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN UNDER GEORGE OSBORNE AND HE'S DELIVERED A LOT OF THEM IF IT'S A GLOOMY BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR WILL TRY TO SURPRISE US WITH A BIT OF GOOD NEWS FOR DAYS AFTER IT'S BEEN DELIVERED THE EXPERTS WILL PULL IT ALL APART SO IT IS PROVING YET AGAIN THE SURPRISE YESTERDAY WAS THE SUGAR TAX BUT THE SERIOUS FLAW
AT THE HEART OF THE BUDGET ACCORDING TO MOST ECONOMISTS AS HE WAS SIMPLY TOO OPTIMISTIC HE'S ALREADY BROKEN TWO OF THE RULES HE'D SET HIMSELF BUT THE ECONOMY MAY VERY WELL MISS HIS THIRD ACHIEVING A BUDGET SURPLUS IN SIMPLE TERMS RESTORING THE NATION TO THE POSITION WHERE WE STOP SPENDING MORE THAN WE'RE RUINING IT ON THAT BIG AMBITION THAT HE AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE JUDGED AND THE CHANCELLOR IS ON THE LINE NO GOOD MORNING MISTER OSBORNE
GOOD MORNING JOHN HOW ARE YOU NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING YOUR PROMISES MAKING YOUR TARGETS
LOOK I PROMISE TO TRY AND TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GOVERNMENT I THINK WE CAN SAY WE'VE ACHIEVED A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE SOLD OUT TO ACHIEVE WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER THAN ANY OTHER MAJOR ECONOMY IN THE WORLD UNEMPLOYMENT FELL AGAIN YESTERDAY BUT WE ARE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND BRITAIN HAS TO BE PREPARED FOR WHATEVER IS THROWN AT IT
AND THE STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO IN THE BUDGET WE HOLD TO THE COURSE WE'VE SET OUT FOR BRITAIN WE TAKE FURTHER ACTION ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES SO WE DON'T PAY LATER AND WE'RE BACK
SMALL BUSINESSES THE SELF EMPLOYED WORKING PEOPLE LURING THEIR TAXES SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO HELP OUR ECONOMY GROW AND SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME YUP THAT AND INDEED YOU SAID ALL OF THAT YESTERDAY BUT MY
QUESTION TO YOU WAS BASED ON THE FACT AND IT IS A FACT THAT YOU SET YOURSELF THREE TARGETS AND YOU HAVE ALREADY FAILED TO MEET TWO OF THEM THE TARGET OF DEBT DECLINING AS A PROPORTION OF NATIONAL INCOME FOR THE START A VERY IMPORTANT TARGET AND THESE THINGS WERE WERE ENSHRINED IN LAW EFFECTIVELY YOU SIMPLY SO THAT IT WILL BE DIDN'T MEET HIM BUT SO WHAT REALLY
LOOK I SET OUT VERY PUBLICLY THERE ENSHRINED IN A CHANCERY PUT BEFORE PARLIAMENT WHAT WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE AS A GOVERNMENT HERE WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE IS TO REPAIR A PUBLIC FINANCE COUNTRY MORE THAN SEEK TO ACHIEVE YOU WERE GOING TO DO THESE THINKERS AND USE AS YOU SAY IN FRYING THEM INTO LAW AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE TWO OF THE THREE
JOHN WHAT WE DO IS WE SET OUT OUR PLANS AND THEN WE'RE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED AGAINST THAT THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE NO CHANCES EVER SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO THAT AND I DIDN'T FEEL THAT I WILL FIND
BUT AMBER LET ME EXPLAIN WE SET OUT A PLAN IT'S A TOUGH CONSOLIDATION FOR OUR COUNTRY IN OTHER WORDS WERE HAVING TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS WHEN I BECAME THE CHANCELLOR WE WERE BORROWING ONE POUND IN EVERY FOUR WE SPENT ON EVERY POLICE OFFICER EVERY TEACHER EVERY ROAD REBUILT EVERY PENSION WE PAID WE ARE NOW GOING TO BE BORROWING ONE POUND IN EVERY FOURTEEN SO THINGS HAVE IMPROVED IN OUR COUNTRY IS CLEARLY MUCH STRONGER IT WAS I GUYS YOU'RE ONLY WHAT WHAT
YES I'M COMING ON TO THAT JOHN EVER BY OUR OWN MEASUREMENTS HERE WE ARE THE TESTS WE SET OURSELVES INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED WE HAVE GOT MORE TO DO WE'VE GOT MORE TO DO TO GET THAT DEBT FALLING WITH ALL THAT WATER DO TO MAKE SURE WE DELIVER THAT BUDGET SURPLUS AND I SET OUT THOSE ACTIONS IN THERE YES BUT THE BUDGET WHAT SORT DO YOU HAVE THE BIRDS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID ON THIS PROGRAMME WHICH I DO NOT HIDE FROM TELLING THE BRITISH PEOPLE
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND THEN I SET OUT THE ACTION TO DELIVER IT AND PEOPLE CAN SEE THE INCREASED SECURITY AND A COUNTRY AS A RESULT ALL THEY COULD TAKE ANOTHER YOU THEY COULD SAY HERE'S A BLOKE WHO MADE THREE
FIRM NON NEGOTIABLE COMMITMENTS TO THE NATION THESE THREE TARGETS THAT HAD TO BE SET NOBODY MADE YOU DO THIS YOU CHOSE TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF YOU SAID THESE ARE THE THREE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO DO BECAUSE THE NATION NEEDED YOU HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE TWO OF THEM IT'S LOOKING PRETTY UNLIKELY ACCORDING TO MOST PEOPLE THAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE THE THIRD SO WHAT I'M TESTED TOO I SUPPOSE WHAT I'M ASKING YOU REALLY IS WHAT'S A BLOKE GOT TO DO IN YOUR JOB TO GET THE SACK
WHAT LIBBY LET ME TAKE THE FIRST OF ALL THE BRITISH PEOPLE HOLD ME TO ACCOUNT AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE DIDN'T CHUCK OUT THE GOVERNMENT'S IF THEY DON'T LIKE THEN THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT A DEMOCRACY AND I THINK
PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED WE SAID WE TURN THE COUNTRY ROUND IT'S A MUCH STRONGER PLACE THAN IT WAS PEOPLE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS OUT OUTSIDE IN THE WORLDS THEY LISTEN TO YOUR PROGRAMME EVERY MORNING AND THEY HEAR THE REPORTS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN STOCK MARKETS AND IN CHINA IN AMERICA AND SO ON AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS BRITAIN GOING TO DO TO RESPOND TO THAT I'M NOT PRETENDING
WE HAVE ABOLISHED BOOM AND BUST AS PREVIOUS CHANCELLORS HAVE PRETENDED I'M NOT PRETENDING BRITAIN IS IMMUNE TO WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD THAT'S BLATANTLY NOT THE CASE WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE CAN RESPOND TO THESE EVENTS ARE JUST HAPPENS IN OUR OWN HANDS WHAT YOU COULD SO WHY HAVE I AM LET ME EXPLAIN JOHN FIRST SAW WE HAVE TAKEN ACTION
TO REDUCE PUBLIC SPENDING THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO GO ON YOUR PROGRAMME TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT EVERY DAY AND AS A RESULT WE ARE BORROWING BORROWING IS COMING DOWN A DEFICIT HAS COME DOWN KNOW WE ARE A MUCH MORE SECURE COUNTRY NEW AND THIS SET OF THOUGHT DEPT OF WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE SPECIFIC CLAIMS LET ME CHALLENGE YOU WANT THEM BECAUSE YOU SAY WE REDUCED OUR BORROWING
THE TARGA DOG DEBT DECLINING AS A PROPORTION OF NATIONAL INCOME EVERY YEAR HAS NOT BEEN MET
I THOUGHT I SAID THAT IN THE BUDGET THAT IS A TOUCH I'D MAKE THESE ARE VERY PUBLIC COMMITMENTS TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS AIMING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN IN THE SPACE OF FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS THINGS HAVE GOT MATERIALLY WORSE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN OTHER WORDS A PRODUCT ANOTHER FAILURE I SHALL IN BRITAIN AND AND IN OTHER COUNTRY HAVE SO YOU'RE FAILING IN THIS COUNTRY
AS A RESULT I MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO MY PLANS TO MAKE SURE THE DEBT DOES FULL AS A PROPORTION OF NATIONAL INCOME IN THE COMING YEAR I'VE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO MY PLANS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GOING TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS AND GET THAT SURPLUS ON WELFARE SPENDING GUESS ON THE FIRST CHANCELLOR EVER TO SAY LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE SPEND ON WELFARE HAS TO TAKE ACTION TO TRY AND KEEP WITHIN THE
FOR CAN WE SET ALTHOUGH OF COURSE BENEFITS ACTUALLY TO THE MOST VULNERABLE ARE GOING UP IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT WE'RE SPENDING ON THEM WE DO ALL THESE THINGS THEY'RE NOT THESE AREN'T I KNOW THEY SOUND LIKE ABSTRACT RULES AND VERY LARGE NUMBERS TO PEOPLE BUT WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT
HIS ECONOMIC SECURITY A COUNTRY THAT HAS A PLAN A COUNTRY PREPARED TO ACT NOW SO WE DON'T PAY LATER A GOVERNMENT WITH AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT IS GOING TO HOLD BROUGHT COURSES ARE SET OUT IN UNCERTAIN TIME ALERTNESS COULD BE ANOTHER BIG NUMBER BECAUSE YOU TALK TO BUT YOUR LAST BIG TARGET MISSED THOSE FIRST TWO YOUR LAST BIG ONE ACHIEVING ABOVE BUDGET SURPLUS YOU'VE GOT TO GO FROM A DEFICIT OF TWENTY BILLION TO A SURPLUS OF TEN BILLION OF THEM OVER A YEAR MOST PEOPLE THINK YOU NEED A MIRACLE TO DO THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY WHAT THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE FOR BUDGET WAS FIFTY FIFTY
THAT'S THAT IS THE JUDGEMENT THEY'VE MADE AND EVERY SINGLE BUDGET DELIVERED SINCE I CREATED THIS INTERNATIONAL BODY ALL THE PREVIOUS CHANCERS YOU INTERVIEW JOHN WOULD ALWAYS JUST ASSERT THESE FIGURES AND YOU WOULD SAY YOU FIDDLED THE FIGURES AND SO ON WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION BASED ON THE FACT THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT FORECAST THAT I DON'T GET TO FIDDLE WHILE I GET TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE WE FIX OUR PLANS
TO FIT THE FIGURES RIGHT WE DON'T FIX THE FIGURES TO FIT ALL RIGHT SO SO CASUAL DIFFERENCE AND ON THE BOND OF DELIVERING THE SURPLUS WE'VE SET OUT A PLAN AND I'LL COMPLETELY ENGLAND PENDANT OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY SAYS YES ON THE BASIS OF THE MEASURES THE YOU HAVE SET OUT ON THE DECISIONS YOU HAVE TAKEN YOU WILL ACHIEVE THAT BUDGET SURPLUS AND AGAIN IT'S NOT A FAKE SO WHAT ARE YOU COMMITTING SHEILA PRESS THE BUDGET SURPLUSES REQUIRED SO THAT AS A COUNTRY WE ARE
LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS WE'RE PUTTING ASIDE MONEY TO REDUCE OUR DEBT WE ARE PREPARING OURSELVES FOR WHATEVER STORMS LIE AHEAD SO THAT IS AN ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT IS IT THAT YOU WILL ACHIEVE THAT SURPLUS
BUT THE COMMITMENT WE MADE WAS THAT IN NORMAL TIMES IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING THERE'S ANOTHER LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT THEY DON'T THAT IS THE COMMITMENT WE MATE I MEAN WE'RE NOT ASKING WE'VE GOT A TWO BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE AN AWFUL LOT TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
NOT EXACTLY FIDDLED THE FIGURES THAT THERE BUT THE THE CORPORATION TAX WINDFALL OF WHEREVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT'S BEING KIND OF ADJUSTED HASN'T IT SO IT'LL FALL AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO DO THAT AND THE CUTS AND BEEN ADJUSTED DO THE SAME WHAT I'M ASKING YOU WHETHER AS A RESULT OF DOING ALL OF THAT AND SOME PEOPLE ARE A BIT SNIFFY ABOUT THE WAY YOU'VE DONE ALL OF THAT BUT AS A RESULT OF DOING ALL OF THAT IS THERE A COMMITMENT THAT YOU WILL BE IN SURPLUS YOU WILL MEET YOUR THIRD TARGET
THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO REACH A BUDGET SURPLUS IN NORMAL TIMES SO WE SAY IF YOU TO GET AWAY ON A LIVID JUDGE LET ME PICK UP ON THIS I'M SAYING IF THE ECONOMY'S GROWING
IF YOUR ECONOMY IS PERFORMING YOU SHOULD BE MAKING SURE YOU DON'T SPEND MORE THAN NEW RAISING TAXES AND YOU SHOULD BE PUTTING ASIDE MONEY TO REDUCE THAT NOW OBVIOUSLY IF YOUR NAME MUCH WORSE SITUATION A RECESSION FOR EXAMPLE AND WE ARE NOT IN THAT AT ALL TODAY OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS FALLING BUT IF YOU'RE IN A RECESSION THEN YOU HAVE TO ALTER YOUR PLANS I WOULD SAY THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SENSIBLE COMMONSENSE FLEXIBLE APPROACH PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT FROM A CHANCE EXCHEQUER WHOSE GOD IS A LIE
WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ECONOMY AND HE'S NOT BEEN IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT THIS I'M DOING NO MORE NO LESS THAN IS REQUIRED TO KEEP A COUNTRY ALSO SAYING THAT ALL OUT IN BLACK AND WHITE IN A CHARTER BEFORE PARLIAMENT AND SO THE PUBLIC CAN SEE AND THEN WE ARE INDEPENDENTLY JUDGE THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE WHO LOOKS OR WHAT OUR CHANCES ARE OF ACHIEVING AT THE OBI ARE
JUDGE US AGAINST THAT TARGET AND THEY SAY WE'RE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE IT RIGHT BUT THIS IF ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS ARISE AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VERY WELL MAY BECAUSE WE CAN'T TELL YOU BEEN BLOWN OFF COURSE QUITE A LOT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS YOU COULD BE FACING WE THE NATION AND COULD BE FACING VASTLY GREATER CUTS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT TARGET
I I'VE NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM SAYING THAT IF THE COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO TAKE ACTION AND WE'VE GOT TO CUT OUR CLOTH ACCORDING TO GIRLS RECKLESS AND WOODEN JOHN WE PAID THE PRICE IN A PREVIOUS GENERATION THE LAST DECADE WHEN AS A STORM CROWDS GATHERED WE DID NOT RAIN IN OUR SPENDING
AND AS A RESULT THIS COUNTRY HAD THE BIGGEST BUDGET DEFICIT OR ANY OF THE MAJOR COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WE WERE THE LEAST WELL PREPARED FOR THE CRISIS THAT THEN ENSUED WE HAD THE BIGGEST BAILOUT WE'LL REMEMBER THE ALARMING REPORTS ON THIS PROGRAMME OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO THE BRITISH ECONOMY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO TODAY I WOULD SAY WE ARE THE BEST PREPARED OR ONE OF THE BEST PREPARED OF ANY OF THE MAJOR ECONOMIES FOR THESE VERY ON UNSUCCESSFUL I NOT BECAUSE ON OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND NEW ACKNOWLEDGED YOURSELF PRODUCTIVITY
IS A DISASTER FOR THIS COUNTRY WE ARE NOT IN THERE ROSY POSITION AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SPENT SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME AND EFFORT DURING THE PAST SIX YEARS TRYING TO MEET ALL THESE DIFFERENT ARGOS YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN SPENT MUCH MORE TIME AND EFFORT TRYING TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND IF YOU DONE THAT WHO KNOWS HE MIGHT HAVE HIT THE TARGET WITHOUT EVEN MEETING THE SETTEE
PRODUCTIVITY IS GROWING IS CONTRIBUTE A CRIKE RIGHT TO SAY AND IT'S A BIG NATIONAL CHALLENGE FOR US ALL IT IS NOT GROWING IT
THAT IS A CHALLENGE THAT ALL WESTERN COUNTRIES FACE NO YOU'VE SET OUT A DELIBERATE SET A DECISION PROBABLY DID IT WE'VE SAID A DELIBERATE SET TO DECISIONS ABOUT HOW AS A COUNTRY WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE ARE MORE COMPETITIVE OUR KIDS ARE BETTER EDUCATED WITH BUILDING THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE SHOULD BE BUILDING AS A COUNTRY WITH DEVOLVING POWER TO OUR ENGLISH CITIES AND COUNTIES AND THE NATIONS OF A UNITED KINGDOM AND WE ARE REDUCING TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE THAT HEADLINE RATE OF TAX ON BUSINESS
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF WORKING PEOPLE'S HELPING THE SELF EMPLOYED THAT IS OUR PRODUCTIVITY PLAN IF YOU LIKE AND WHAT HIS PRODUCTIVITY PRODUCTIVITY IS ECONOMIST TERM FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE EFFORTS AND THE TALENTS OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THOSE TALENTS THOSE EFFORTS AND FOR EXAMPLE TODAY WE'RE SETTING OUT FURTHER MAJOR REFORMS TO EDUCATION
FURTHER MAJOR REFORMS TO THE WAY THAT TEACHERS ARE QUALIFIED SO THEY'RE RECOGNISED FOR THE PROFESSION THEY ARE THEY GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED A HEAD TEACHERS ARE INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT TEACHERS ARE QUALIFIED HERE THESE ARE THE KIND OF REFORMS THE REQUIRED
IF BRITAIN IS GOING TO STAY AHEAD CLOSELY BECAUSE I'LL BE AT PRECISELY BECAUSE ALL OF THESE WESTERN COUNTRIES FACE THE SAME CHALLENGE WHICH IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROVIDE RISING LIVING STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE OF YOUR GRID NICAEA COUNTRY PREPARED TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN LET ME GIVE YOU A VERY SIMPLE QUOTE THAT WE HAVE ON THIS PROGRAMME YESTERDAY FROM THE BOSS OF BIG CONTAINER TO EMILY SAID OUR BIGGEST EXPORT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS FRESH AIR AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT
WELL IF YOU TAKE THINGS LIKE THE CAR INDUSTRY IT IS AN AMAZING SUCCESS STORY DOESN'T IT IN ONE WELL LET'S LOOK AT THE BROADER THE CHOKING CAN I JUST MAKE A POINT WHERE I GREW UP IN AN ERA
THE REPORTS ON THE TELEVISION WAS ALWAYS ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY THE DECLINE OF THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY NOW WE ARE PRODUCING A RECORD AMOUNT OF CARS WERE SELLING THEM INTO EUROPE AND SELLING THEM AROUND THE WORLD WE ARE
ACTUALLY I THINK PRODUCING MORE CARS IN THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND ALONE THAN AND THE WHOLE OF ITALY PRODUCES THAT IS AN AMAZING SUCCESS STORY IT'S A TRIBUTE TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THAT INDUSTRY IT'S ALSO A TRIBUTE TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS MADE ITSELF A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS JUST A QUICK THOUGHT YOU SEE ON WE'D TO BE THINK THE FRENCH ARE DEAD IDOL DON'T WE WERE ALWAYS SAYING THAT BUT THE REALITY YOU IN TERMS OF TO FRENCH WORKERS CHEESE MORE BY THURSDAY THAN A BRITISH WORKER DOES UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK
WELL IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT FOR DECADES BRITISH PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT THEN WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE I COMPLETELY AGREE IF YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT WE'VE GOT A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH OUR PRODUCTIVITY YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S WHY IN THE BUDGET YESTERDAY I CUT TAXES FOR SMALL BUSINESS A REFORMED EDUCATION SO WE HAD LONGER SCHOOL DAYS IT COMMITTED TO BIG INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS HERE IN THE PENNINES WHERE I'M VISITING THIS GREAT SCHOOL
WE DID THE MAJOR REFORMS TO SAVING SOME PEOPLE CAN SAY FOR THEIR FUTURE AND HELP TO BUY A HOME AND SAVE FOR THEIR RETIREMENT AND OF COURSE WE CUT TAXES FOR BUSINESSES FOR ON TAXIS WERE TALKING ABOUT A VERY QUICK FINAL THOUGHT A LABOUR M.P. SAYS SHE HAS TABLED AN AMENDMENT TO THE FINANCE BILL THAT WOULD FORCE YOU TO REDUCE THE V.A.T. ON SANITARY PROD PROD HER PRODUCTS TO ZIA ANOTHER WORDS THE TAMPON TAX THIS IS POORLY SHERIFF YOU'VE GOT PUFF CROSS PARTY SUPPORT AND ALL THE REST
IF THAT GOES THROUGH AND IT PROBABLY WILL WE'LL YOU IN SPITE OF WHAT EUROPE SAYS CUT IT REDUCE REMOVE THE TAMPON TAX
I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S ANGER AT PAYING THE TEMP ON TANKS WILL YOU COME ON LYNNIE ANSWER HER QUESTION HER PERFUME AND STAMP IT WAS ANGER AT THE TEMP ON DAX
THE FIRST THING I'VE DONE IS I MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE RAISE FROM THE V.A.T. ON SANITARY PRODUCTS NOW GOES TO WOMEN'S CHARITIES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUPPORT ON THE TELLY CHARITIES AND I ALLOCATED THAT MONEY YESTERDAY SECOND I SAID WE WOULD GET AGREEMENT THAT WE COULD REDUCE THIS RATE TO ZERO AND I THINK WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF GETTING I DON'T GET IT WILL YOU DO IT ACTUALLY I THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF GETTING THAT ARE GREAT THEY DON'T
BUT AS I SAY WE'RE GIVING THE MONEY AT THE MOMENT I KNOW YOU SAID TO GET AGREEMENT FROM EUROPE WILL YOU DO IT UNILATERALLY THAT AS I SAY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT AGREEMENT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE HOPE AND PEOPLE WILL SEE TWO CRUCIAL THINGS ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT FIRST OF ALL WERE A STRONG VOICE IN THE WORLD
AND WE GET WHAT WE ASKED FOR BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE TOP TABLE MATS FOR ANOTHER'S A SECOND SECOND SECOND WE DO THE RIGHT THING BY HER COUNTRY AND HERE WE ARE USING MONEY RAISED FROM OUR TAXES ON GREAT CHARITIES GREAT PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH IN THE END IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT GEORGE OSBORNE THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT LAURA BECAUSE OUR POLITICAL EDITOR COMMENTS LAURA
GOOD MORNING JOHN LISTENING TO THE CHANCELLOR HAD THEY'RE WRIGGLING SLIGHTLY OVER THE ECONOMY AND ALSO A VERY KEEN TO MENTION ANY OTHER REFORMS THAT HE'S PROMISING ANOTHER REFORM TO EDUCATION MENTION VERY BRIEFLY THERE A PROMISE OF CHANGES A TEACHER QUALIFICATIONS WILL HEAR MORE OF THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO THAT TO WHAT HE'S SAYING
BUT AS EVER GEORGE OSBORNE IS TRYING TO DO LOTS OF THINGS AT THE SAME TIME HE'S TRYING TO POLITICALLY MULTI TASK AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE MORE CUTS BUT TRIED TO FORGE AHEAD WITH BIG REFORMS IN SOME AREAS BUT THE CENTRAL POINT OF COURSE WAS LISTENING TO THEY'RE WRIGGLING A BIT OVER HOW HE'S FAILED TWO OF THE THREE BIG TESTS THAT HE SET HIMSELF
THAT KIND OF SADO MASOCHISTIC THING THAT CHANCELLOR HE'S ALWAYS SEEM TO INSIST ON DOING SET RULES TO MAKE A POLITICAL STATEMENT AND THEN BREAK THEM AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS REAL SCEPTICISM THAT THE MIRACULOUS TURNAROUND FROM THE RED TO THE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY IS ACHIEVABLE ECONOMICALLY AND SOME CYNICISM TO GET THE TIMING OF THAT IS ABOUT THE POLITICS AND HIS AMBITION ONE MINISTER TOLD ME THIS MORNING IT'S FIXING THE LEADERSHIP WHILE THE SUN IS SHINING
AND THIS FURY IN LABOUR AND DISQUIET AMONG SOME TORIES TO ABOUT THE BIGGEST CUT IN THE BUDGET WHICH IS THOSE PAYMENTS TO SOME DISABLED PEOPLE OF THE CHANCELLOR WOULD SAY AS HE HAS BEFORE THEIR OVERALL PAYMENTS ARE GOING UP THAT MAY WELL PROVE VERY TRICKY TO GET THROUGH THERE'S ALSO A BIT OF GRUMPINESS ABOUT THE SUGAR TAX AND YOU KNOW JUST AS YOU WERE MENTIONING TO HIM AT THE END THAT ISSUE OVER THE TAMPON TAX WITH THE E.U. REFERENDUM PARING DOWN
THERE IS THE BEGINNINGS OF AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN LABOUR M.P.S AND EURO SCEPTICS TO MAKE TROUBLE OVER THEIR BUDGET AND THAT COULD IN THE COMING WEEKS BECOME VERY TROUBLESOME INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH

VERY EARLY ON IN HIS TENURE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SUPPORTERS LEAVING THE GROUND HOW WE FELT ALONE IN THAT STUNT MARCH THE PLAYERS UP TO THE OTHER COP AFTER THE OTHER WEST BROM DRAWER I THINK HE'S JUST VERY VERY KEEN TO GET THEIR SUPPORTERS AND YOU'RE FULLY BEHIND WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO AND THEY ARE CREATING A GREAT DEAL OF EXCITEMENT AT THE MOMENT'S HERE OR WORD OF WARNING THOUGH MANCHESTER UNITED ONCE CAME BACK FROM A TWO NIL DEFICIT AGAINST BARCELONA TO WIN THREE MILL THEY DID A LONG TIME AGO GARRY BUT NOT THAT I'M A MAGICIAN

OH NOT AGAIN MANY AREAS FINE AND SUNNY INCLUDING PROBABLY WIGTON THURSDAY IT SAYS HERE IN A RATHER AMERICAN STAMP YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR THE JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TONIGHT A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS OR ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS REJECTED SUGGESTIONS HE'LL HAVE TO RAISE TAXES OR CUT SPENDING TO MEET HIS TARGET OF A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THE END OF THE DECADE
THE LEADING ECONOMIC RESEARCH GROUP THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAID MISTER OSBORNE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH ROOM TO MANOEUVRE IF GROWTH PROJECTIONS ARE DOWNGRADED FURTHER MISTER OSBORNE TOLD US HE HAD THE BACKING OF THE INDEPENDENT FORECAST OF THE OFFICE OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY AND WAS CONFIDENT OF ACHIEVING HIS GOAL HE ADDED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO TAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS IF THEY WERE NECESSARY
A PROPOSED DEAL WITH TURKEY AIMED AT HALTING THE FLOW OF MIGRANTS TO GREECE AS EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE AGENDA OF A MEETING OF EUROPEAN LEADERS IN BRUSSELS THIS AFTERNOON AMONG THE ISSUES IT'S THE STATUS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS CAMPED ON THE GREEK BORDER WITH MACEDONIA TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE BROADCASTER CLIFF MITCHELL MORE WHO'S DIED AGED NINETY SIX HIS CAREER SPANNED FOUR DECADES THE B.B.C.'S DIRECTOR GENERAL LORD HALL SAID CLIFF MITCHELL MOORE WAS ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING BROADCASTERS OF HIS GENERATION
THANK YOU TWENTY SIX MINUTES TIME WHEN THERE'S A BUDGET LEAVE SCOTLAND ENERGY THE EDINBURGH GOVERNMENT POTENTIALLY IN A RATHER INTERESTING QUANDARY WITH THE CHANGES TO TAX THRESHOLDS NOT NECESSARILY BEING COPIED NORTH OF THE BORDER AND WITH THE HELP OF THE OIL INDUSTRY COMING FROM LONDON HELPFUL ECONOMICALLY NOT NECESSARILY POLITICALLY S.N.P. DEPUTY LEADER AND ECONOMY SPOKESPERSON STEWART HOSIE GAVE HIS RESPONSE TO THE TAX HELP FOR OIL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES VALUABLE TO SCOTLAND
VERY WELCOME WE CALLED FOR THOSE MEASURES I HAVE ALSO SAID THERE SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN A MORE STRATEGIC FOCUS ON EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ALLOWANCES BUT IN TERMS OF THE P. AFTER YOU
SUPPLEMENTARY CHARGE CHANGE AS THEY ARE TO BE WELCOMED SUPER FUEL JUDY SABLE WHISKY MEASURES LIKE THAT VERY SENSIBLE
IT'S THE BIG STORY THE BIG PICTURE THE BIG NARRATIVE THE DEBT DEFICIT BORDERING ON WAS THE BIG FRESH SCHOOL TARGETS HE SAY ASS
WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION WHERE THE BORROWING WHICH HE'D PROMISED FOR THE C.E.O. WOULD NOW BE MET FOR ANOTHER
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS WAS QUITE AN INCREDIBLE TALLY OR FEEL YOU'RE FROM GEORGE OSBORNE WHAT ABOUT TAX AND TAX THRESHOLDS MY HOUSE HE WAS ASKED WHETHER THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT WOULD BE FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE WESTMINSTER GOVERNMENT IN IMPLEMENTING A RISE IN THE THRESHOLD AT WHICH THE HIGHER RATE OF INCOME TAX IS PAID
WE SAID THE BASIC RATE WOULD GO UP IN TERMS OF THE FORTY P. THRESHOLD WE WILL
HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS MEANS TODAY BUT I HAVE TO SEE ENCASING THE FORTY P. THRESHOLD WAY WAY ABOVE INFLATION
AT THE SAME TIME AS CONFIRMING BILLIONS OF CUTS FROM DISABLED PEOPLE IS PROBABLY NOT AN APPROACH THAT WE WOULD BE WANTING TO TAKE HAS TOLD SARAH SMITH A SCOTLAND EDITOR INTERESTING ONE THIS ISN'T IT THE SET BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT A REAL DECISION AND A REAL POWER TO DO THINGS DIFFERENT
ABSOLUTELY JUST IN THIS BUDGET WAS REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAST TIME A U.K. CHANCELLOR WILL STAND UP IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND SAID INCOME TAX RATES FOR THE WHOLE OF THE U.K. BECAUSE THIS TIME NEXT YEAR THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE CONTROL OF ALL INCOME TAX RATES AND BANDS
BECAUSE THE CHANGES TO THE THRESHOLDS THAT THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY WON'T COME IN UNTIL NEXT APRIL THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT INSTEAD SO THE S.N.P. HAVE GOT A REALLY SIGNIFICANT
DECISION TO MAKE ABOUT WHAT THEY PROMISE THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GO INTO ELECTIONS IN MAY AND IT'S NOT JUST STUART WHO WAS HE WHO HAS BEEN VERY STRONGLY HINTING THAT THEY MIGHT NOT PASS ON THE RAYS IN THE THRESHOLD FAR HIGHER RATE EARNERS WE'VE HAD SIMILAR THINGS FROM THE FINANCE SECRETARY IN SCOTLAND FROM THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON HERSELF SO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER
TAXPAYERS AND SCOTLAND WILL BE PAYING HIGHER RATES THAN IN THE REST OF THE U.K. ANYBODY EARNING OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR WOULD BE PAYING FOUR HUNDRED MORE POUNDS AND INCOME TAX IN SCOTLAND THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY LIVED SOUTH OF THE BORDER WHAT A SCOTTISH LABOUR
SCOTTISH LABOUR HAVE ACTUALLY PROMISED TO INCREASE INCOME TAX NOT JUST THE BASIC RATE BUT ALSO THE TOP RATE AND THE HIGHER RATE THEY SAY THEY WOULD PUT THEIR FORTY FIVE P. RATE UP TO FIFTY PENCE AS WELL AS ADDING A PENNY ON TO THE BASIC RATE SO YOU CAN SEE THE GROUND IN THIS ELECTION WE'RE GOING IN TO HIM EH IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE FOUGHT OVER ON INCOME TAX AND ON THE NEW POWERS THAT ARE COMING IN THE S. AND P.
PROBABLY NEEDED TO BE SEEN TO BE DOING SOMETHING TO INCREASE THE TAX TAKE COS IT MADE A LOT OF SPENDING PROMISES ON HEALTH AND EDUCATION MAYBE THE CHANCELLOR'S DONE THEM A BIT OF A FAVOUR HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY THEY'RE PUTTING UP TAX THEY DON'T PASS ON THE HIGHER RATE THRESHOLD FOR THE ARTEXING THE BETTER OFF A BIT MORE THAN THE TORIES ARE DOING DOWN SOUTH
BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY INCREASING THE HEADLINE RATE THE WAY LABOUR SAY THEY WANT TO SO IT COULD BE THAT ACTUALLY HE'S DONE A BIT OF A FAVOUR HERE AND WHEN IT COMES THIS HELP FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL AND THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ANY MORE TAX ON MOTORING SHOWS WHO WERE IMPORTANT SCOTT OF THE DISTANCES ARE PEOPLE SOMETIMES DRIVE AND ALL OF THAT AT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE FOR
ORDINARY PEOPLE NEVER MIND THE POLITICS OF IT BUT IT DID IS IT FAIR IN THE CHANCELLOR MADE SO MUCH OF THIS IN THE COMMONS TO MERE RURAL SORT OF ROAR OF SUPPORT FROM HIS BENCHES WHEN HE LOOKED AT THE S.N.P. AND SO WERE DOING THESE THINGS FOR SCOTLAND DO THEM BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ET-CETERA ET-CETERA DOES THAT RESONATE REAL GIANT FROM THEM TO THE S. AND P. SAYING BASICALLY IF YOU WEAR AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WHICH HAD THE REFERENDUM GONE THE OTHER WAY SCOTLAND WILL BE AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY FROM THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK
SCOTLAND WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO THIS TO HELP THE OIL INDUSTRY THIS WAY ONLY BECAUSE IT REMAINED PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM THE S.N.P. HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB IN SCOTLAND I HAVE TO SAY RATHER DEEP POLITICISING THE POLITICS OF OIL ANY TIME ANYBODY MAKES THAT KIND OF GYBED THEY SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR WAY OF LOOKING AT A SIGNIFICANT U.K. INDUSTRY WHERE JOBS ARE BEING LOST IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PLAY POLITICS WITH THAT WE ALL NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND
BOTH GOVERNMENTS IN EDINBURGH AND IN WESTMINSTER NEED TO DO AS MUCH AS THEY CAN TO HELP THE OIL INDUSTRY AND WHAT HELP WAS GIVEN TO THEM THE S. AND P. OF COURSE SAID THE CHANCELLOR'S DONE WHAT WE ASKED THEM TO SEW THOSE POLITICS REALLY CHEERED UP THE TORY BENCHES YOU COULD HEAR THAT YESTERDAY DURING THE BUDGET BUT IN SCOTLAND THEY PROBABLY DON'T PLAY THAT WELL SO THANKS
TWENTY TO NINE THERE HAS BEEN ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH IN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RESEARCHERS HAVE MANAGED TO RESTORE MEMORIES IN MICE THAT HAVE BEEN BRED TO HAVE THE EARLY STAGES OF THE DISEASE HERE'S DOCTORS ASSUME ALL I'LL GO UP THE PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY A NEUROSCIENCE AT THEIR MESSAGES INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE SUPERVISOR OF THE STUDY
WE'VE FOUND THE IMPAIRMENT IS IN THERE I'VE BURIED THE RETREAT YOU STORE THE MEMORY AND ACKNOWLEDGING CALLED OP CALLED GENETICS IF WE GOT A WEE CURE UGH IF IMPAIRMENT IN THE MOUSE MODEL I'VE HAD MY PATIENTS
IT'S A PATIENT COME FORMAL MEMORY NOT THAT THEY HAVE LOST A BIT ICKY POOL NICK MEMORY IF IF IS APPLICABLE TO HUMAN PATIENTS WITH WE THINK YOU CAN GIVE THEM A GRIEF COULD BE AIDS PATIENTS HAVE A HOPE IN THERE
HOW INTERESTING DOCTOR SIMON RIDLEY'S THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH HAD ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH YOU KAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT'S FASCINATING ISN'T IT IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO MAKE A MEMORY
THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS WHY IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND EXCITING RESEARCH THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO TEASE OUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEMORY DEFICIT THAT ONE CAN CAN SEE PERHAPS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING ONE OF THE CAVEATS HERE IS THEY'RE STUDYING PERHAPS A MODEL OF THE EARLIEST CHANGES IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SO IN LATER ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WHEN PERHAPS THE SYMPTOMS ARE MORE MANIFEST
ONE HAS LOST NERVE CELLS TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT AND THIS REVERSAL I THINK IS PROBABLY LESS LIKELY SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PERHAPS IS A FAIRLY NARROW WINDOW WHERE THIS REVERSE SANITY MAY ONE DAY BE REALLY SO TRY AND GIVE ME A SORT OF CASE STUDY AS IT WERE SOMEBODY IS DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S A LETTER SAY A RELATIVELY EARLY AGE SAY SIXTY
AND IT IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES WHAT HAPPENS ONE WILL BELIEVE WHAT WE BELIEVE HAPPENS AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS IS THERE AN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CERTAIN PROTEINS START TO BUILD UP AND ONE OF THOSE PROTEINS IS A PROTEIN CALLED AMA LLOYD AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE STUDYING THESE MICE AS IT AS IT HAPPENS
SO OVER TIME I'M ALLOY STARTS TO BUILD UP THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVE CELLS START TO GET DAMAGE IN THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE CRUCIAL FOR FOR NORMAL BRAIN FUNCTION A NEURONAL FUNCTION AND AS THEY BECOME DAMAGED THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE NERVE CELLS DIE OTHER THINGS HAPPEN THE BRAIN
GETS A NEW PHENOMENON CALLED NEWER INFORMATION SO INFLAMMATORY CELLS COULD ACTIVATED THERE'S A SORT OF VICIOUS CYCLE I THINK OF DAMAGE WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN PERSON DYING SO SO THAT'S SORT OF MAYBE TWO OR TWO DECADES PERHAPS SO FOCUSING ON THE VERY EARLY STAGES WE'RE LOOKING AT PERHAPS THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVE CELLS WHICH ARE STARTING TO GET DAMAGED BUT THOSE THAT DAMAGE MAY WELL BE REVERSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING AND TRANSPARENT HOW DO YOU DO THAT
WELL HE'S SO EXPERIMENTALLY WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS IT'S HIGHLY CONTRIVED BUT VERY CLEVER SYSTEM OF OCTO GENETICS WHERE THEY'RE USING LIGHT AND A GENE ULTIMATELY FROM AN ALGAE TO ACTIVATE NERVE CELLS NOW I THINK THAT IS VERY VERY UNLIKELY TO BE EVER TO BE USEFUL IN HUMAN SO THAT'S IMPORTANT CAVEAT THE LEAD RESEARCHER SOUND OPTIMISTIC AND I THINK A LONG TERM ONE SHOULD BE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE COULD
DO SOMETHING SIMILAR TO HUMANS IN TERMS OF REVERSING THE THIS DAMAGE BUT I THINK WE'D BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ROUTES I THINK THE ROOTS TO REVERSING THIS DAMAGE AND IN PEOPLE WOULD BE TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THE DAMAGE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AT THE SYNAPTIC LEVEL AT THESE CONNECTIONS AND SEEING IF ONE CAN PERHAPS TARGET THERAPIES TO REBUILD AND RECONNECT THESE THESE DAMAGE COULD IMITATE OTHER WORDS
RESTORE A MEMORY OR JUST ALLOW US TO RESTORE OUR ACTIVE MEMORY AS IT WERE SO THAT I CAN REMEMBER WHAT I DID YESTERDAY AS IT WERE OR WHAT I AM DOING NOW TOMORROW PERHAPS THAT'S A BETTER WAY OF PUTTING IT ISN'T IT YES ALSO RESTORE WHAT WE COS WE DID THE CLICHE MAYBE IT IS A CREATURE THAT IS WHAT OLD AGE THAT THESE SORTS OF DISEASES MEANS YOU CAN REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID FIFTY YEARS AGO HE CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT IS THAT THE CASE
WELL YES I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND I THINK ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS IT'S AN EXTREME VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENS IN OLD AGE I THINK PEOPLE TEND TO EXPERIENCE AGE RELATED MEMORY DECLINE AND MOST OF THAT DOESN'T IMPACT ON PEOPLE IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY BUT AREN'T SEES IS A DIFFERENT IS A DIFFERENT BEAST MEAN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE BUILD UP OF THESE PROTEINS WHICH DAMAGE AND KILL NERVE CELLS AND THAT'S A FAR MORE
FAR MORE SERIOUS MANIFESTATION OF OF THIS PROBLEM SO I THINK WHAT ONE IS LOOKING AT IS WAYS STRATEGIES
I THINK TO UNDERSTAND AND HOPEFULLY REPAIR THE DAMAGE CONNECTIONS IN THE EARLY STAGES BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE NOT DOCTOR REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT BOTH GARY AND JOHN WERE ODDLY EXCITED WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE OFFICE THIS MORNING BOTH OF THEM SAYING THEY'D SEEN A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY YES AND
TALK AT PEOPLE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD SEEN AND INDEED IT APPEARS THAT THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WAS A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY IT STREAKED ABOVE BRITAIN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WITNESSES DESCRIBING IT AS A GREEN FLASH MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH LEAVING A MAGNESIUM WHITE TRAIL AND HERE ARE TWO MEN NOT GARY AND JOHN THERE AND STAFFORD NORTH EAST COAST OF ENGLAND WHO SAID HAD TOLD US WHAT THEY SAW
IT STOPPED FLUSHED AND THEN SHOT OFF AT AN ANGLE BASICALLY IT DOWNWARDS
IT SHOT OFF AT AN AMAZING SPEED COMING DOWN IT WAS LIKE A TRAIL OF WHITE BLUE LIGHT AS IN THE BIG FLASH THE WHOLE SKY
LIT UP WITH GREEN AND THEN FROM THERE WHY WOULD LIKE A FIREWORK IT'S LIKE A FIREWORK IN REVERSE IT'S THE GREEN CAME FIRST THE BEAKS
ALL RIGHT THINK EXTREME OFF FROM IT
DOCTOR KAREN MASTERS IS AN ASTRONOMER AT THE INSTITUTE OF COSMOLOGY AND GRAVITATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH AND HIS ONLINE MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING YOU DIDN'T SAY DID IT NO I WAS ASLEEP WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING AT
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A METEOR A CHUNK OF ROCK OR METALLIC WHAT MOST LIKELY COMING IN FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM
AND HITTING THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE AND WHY WAS THIS ONE BRIGHTER THAN THEY NORMALLY I AM SO
BASICALLY THE BIGGER THEY ARE THE BRIGHTER THEY GET THIS ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN DENNIS TYPICAL IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS HIT THE EARTH EVERY DAY MOST OF THEM OVER THE OCEANS ARE OVER AN INHABITED PARTS OF OF THE WORLD IT'S QUITE RARE THAT ONE GO OVER SUCH A POPULATED PLACE AND BE SO BRIGHT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A SIMILARLY BRIGHT ONE IN SCOTLAND SEEN IN SCOTLAND EARLIER THIS MONTH HOW BIG WAS IT
IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF A TENNIS BALL MAYBE A BIT LARGER REALLY SMALL AS THAT YEAH IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE COULD BE DEPENDS ON THE VELOCITY THE SPEED THAT IT CAME IN AND SO UNTIL THAT ORBIT HAS BEEN PINNED DOWN AND WE'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD ESTHER BEST A REALLY ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF THE VELOCITY IT'S HARD TO SAY BUT BUT BUT ALL THAT LIGHT COMING FROM SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A TENNIS BALL YEAH BECAUSE IT'S MOVING SO FAST IT HAD BEEN GOING TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY KILOMETRES PER SECOND SO INCREDIBLY FAST IT WOULD ORBIT THE EARTH IN FOUR MINUTES
WOW SO YEAH IT WAS JUST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY DUMPED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE CREATE THAT TURNS INTO LIGHT ENERGY AND WHY WAS HER GREEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO WITH THE COMPETITION OF THE COMET QUITE LIKELY IT WAS QUITE METALLIC MAGNESIUM MIGHT ALSO BE TO DO WITH IT EXACTLY WHERE IT HIT THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE TEMPERATURE IT GOT TWO AND THE ATTEMPT THE COLOURS THAT IT MADE THE ATMOSPHERE CLOAK
VERY INTERESTING AND WONDERFUL FOR THOSE WHO SAW AND THE NOT SO WONDERFUL TO ACTUALLY BE UP IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING YEAH WELL IT EXCITED GARY AND JOHN ANYWAY AND SEEN IT WHICH IS A GOOD THING I SUPPOSE I DO WHY NOT A MASTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TWO MINUTES TO NINE FIVE YEARS SINCE THE START OF THE
EXPLOSION OF HOPE AND THE ENERGY THAT WE USED TO CALL THE ARAB SPRING AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE DEGREE OF DISILLUSIONMENT SET IN MORE THAN A DEGREE NO ONE FORESAW THAT THOSE INITIAL HOPEFUL EVENTS IN EGYPT IN TUNISIA WOULD STALL ALL THAT THEY'D BE FOLLOWED BY THE TRAGEDIES OF IRAQ AND SYRIA BUT WHAT AN ARAB SOCIETIES DOING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE VIOLENT AND THE EXTREMIST IDEAS THAT FUELLED THE RISE OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT KELLING CONNIE'S BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME ANSWERS IN HIS SERIES OF REPORT BEGINS AT A SCHOOL IN TUNISIA
NO TIME FOR AN ENGLISH LESSON AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY OF TUNIS IF YOU'RE A PARENT IN THE MODERN MIDDLE EAST ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR CHILDREN
IS TO EQUIP THEM TO GET OUT ISN'T IT YEAH IN THE RESTAURANT YEAH WELL NOT ALL THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES WASHING AROUND THE CITIES OF NORTH AFRICA OR AS BENIGN AS PIZZA HAVE CALLED
THE SCIENCE TEACHER AT THIS SCHOOL IS A DOCTOR FROM LIBYA WHO FLED WITH HER TWO SONS BECAUSE SHE WORRIED THEY'D BE TARGETED BY RECRUITERS FOR THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATES SOME PEOPLE THEY COME TO THE SCHOOL AND EVIL LIKE LETTERS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT WHAT DO YOU DO
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THE DOCTOR'S NAME OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER SAFETY BUT YOU SENSE THAT SHE SPEAKS FOR MILLIONS OF PARENTS IN THE ARAB WORLD IN HER FEARS FOR HER CHILDREN
IF THERE'S A DANGEROUS FIGHT I HEARD MANY STORIES THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO AFFECT
I'M AFRAID THERE WERE THERE WERE THINGS THAT I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO
THE DUTCH THERE WHERE I CAN NOT FOLLOW THEM AND BRING THEM
ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS HAVE RELEASED A VIDEO WHICH THEY SAY SHOWS A JORDANIAN PILOT BEING BURNED TO DEATH FOR THE FAMILY OF MOHAMMED DELLA IAN IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE IN FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR HE WAS ONE OF THOUSANDS OF JORDANIAN PROTESTING AGAINST THE BRUTAL MURDER OF THEIR FIGHTER PILOT MY WORTH
BURNED TO DEATH BY I. S. AFTER HIS PLANE CRASHED ON THEIR TERRITORY BY JUNE MUHAMMAD HAD JOINED I S. HIMSELF
THANK YOU BUT I CAN MAKE A HELP OR BE A DHOLAIDH
THAT MOHAMMED DALAI AINS FATHER SEEMS TO CRUMPLE VISIBLY WITH GRIEF AS HE TELLS THE STORY OF HOW HIS SON WAS RADICALISED APPARENTLY BY A GROUP OF CHECHENS HE MET AT UNIVERSITY IN UKRAINE
BUT WHAT AND I'M FROM ANYTHING AND THEN SLIM UNTIL SHE THOUGHT AND THIS IS NOT THAT FAMILIAR STORY OF A PENNILESS ILLITERATE YOUNG MAN TEMPTED INTO A LIFE OF VIOLENCE OUT OF A LIFE OF DESPAIR
MUHAMMAD WHO WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT WHO DIED AS A SUICIDE BOMBER ON THE BATTLEFIELDS OF IRAQ AND HIS DAD HIS DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE JORDANIAN PARLIAMENT
IT IS EVERY PARENT'S WORST FEAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE
THAT WILL TAKE A BIT OF THAT FOR THEIR WEEK HERE AND HERE OFTEN WITH THE EXTREMISTS OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ARE GOOD AT THE INTERVAL
BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S ONE WAY TRAFFIC IN THESE ONLINE BATTLE OF IDEAS
I MET TWO MEMBERS OF THE POP GROUP THE GREAT DEPARTED IN THE SHABBY CHIC BASEMENT NIGHTCLUB IN BEIRUT WHERE THEY PERFORM THEIR HIT SINGLE MY DAD
SARCASTIC HYMN OF PRAISE TO ABU BACK HOLD I'LL BACK DADDY
THE SELF STYLED CALIPH OF THAT SO CALLED STATE
HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN TO MOCK I SUGGESTED TO THE BAND SO SARCASTIC SONG SO EVERYONE LAUGHS AND EVERYTHING BUT AFTER
THEY'LL ASK YOU I'M NOT AFRAID FROM THE SONG AND SINGING I GUESS I WAS AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS AND UGLY THING
I DON'T THINK SO I TOLD HER THAT WE DON'T FEEL OR BELIEVE A AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY FROM A BAGS OF OPIATE OF ISIS AND THE ART OF OVERREACTING THIS IS WHY THEY THINK I DON'T
THEY SEE PEOPLE WHO I THINK IT WAS A LOT OF SAD ABOUT THIS ONE HASH THIS MUST MASTER SO WAS RUTH
THIS DOES FEEL LIKE A DARK TIME IN THE MIDDLE EAST DANGEROUS TO BE A CHILD AND FRIGHTENING TO BE HAD
BUT LISTEN TO THE GREAT DEPARTED STRIDING CONFIDENTLY INTO THAT INTERNET SPACE BUT I S. HAS LONG DOMINATED
AND YOU SENSE THAT THERE MAY BE A LITTLE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS AFTER
KEVIN CONNOLLY REPORTING FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AT THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE JUST TO TELL YOU IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES PAUL DANIELS PUBLICIST HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAS DIED THE TELEVISION MAGICIAN OF COURSE PAUL DANIELS DIED TODAY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY SEVEN AND HE'D BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN TUMOUR
IT IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE GEORGE OSBORNE SEEMS TO THINK MATHS TEACHING SHOULD BE COMPULSORY IN SCHOOLS UNTIL THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN HE'S ORDERED A REVIEW SHOULD WE APPLAUD
AW BOO MARCUS THE SUIT ORIEL OXFORD UNIVERSITY IS A MATHS PROFESSOR SO WE CAN EXPECT THE STANDING OVATION FROM HIM OR SIMON JENKINS IS A WRITER FOR THE GUARDIAN AND HAVING READ HIS COLUMNS OVER THE YEARS WE CAN EXPECT HIM TO BE THROWN ROTTEN FRUIT OF THE STAGE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY YES CHRIS MUST TEACHING AS A BAD THING
WELL IT'S JUST THE THE OSBORNE I THINK OSBORNE IS JUST IN THE HOUSE BUT HE WAS GOING IT LOOKS FREE GHASTLY ACADEMIES AND THOSE FROM THE DREADED BUREAUCRATIC HAND OF LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND LIBERATE THEM INTO THE HEATHER WITH HER WITH HER WHILE SHE WAS IN THE CURRICULUM WAS YOU NEXT IS HAVING AN EXTRA HOUR SCHOOL MILE LONG RUN GUYS TEACH MATHS JOHN EIGHTEEN AND IN THE MOST DIRE REGIME CONCEIVABLE SUCH AS WE EVER IMAGINE BUT THAT WON'T MATTER ENGINE THAT'S BONKERS IT REALLY IS
WHAT ABOUT NOUGHT POINT ONE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION ARE GOING TO NEED DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS WHERE DO YOU LEARN HONOUR AN OBS LIKE ONE PERCENT WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THAT FROM FROM MY OUTSTANDING MATHS TEACHER BUT NO IT IS IT IS BIDS BECOME A CULT BECAUSE YOU CAN MEASURE IT IT'S BECOME IMPORTANT TO THE PLASTIC OF THAT BECAUSE THEY MEASURE THEM IN CHINA WE CAN MEASURE OURSELVES AGAINST
THE CHINESE TEACHERS WHO ARE MATHS FACTORIES AND SHANGHAI BUT THEY ARE AS GOOD AS THE HATCHET AS WE KEEP BEING TOLD YOU EVIDENCE OF SO WHAT BETTER THAN WE ARE AT MATHS OR SOME OF THEM ARE NO I MEAN IT'S A CLASSIC IS AFTER THE SUBJECT LIKE LATIN WHICH PEOPLE MOVIE THEY SO YOU MUST DO LETTINGS OR CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU MUST YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR MIND IT IS
DEEPLY USELESS SUBJECT FOR MOST PEOPLE AND ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE DO NEED IT SOME PEOPLE NEED ME HEBREW TO BE ARCHAEOLOGISTS THEIRS IS A LUDICROUS TO MAKE IT A COMPULSORY SUBJECT TO EIGHTEEN IS BID WAS MADE A COMPULSORY SUBJECT AT ALL PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO COUNT THE PROPORTION PERCENTAGE YOU CAN DO THAT IN A WEEK MARCUS CAN TEACH THEM IN A DAY RIGHT MARCUS GONG I THIS IS DEEPLY IRRESPONSIBLE I THINK BECAUSE
PARTLY IT IS ABOUT A WAY OF THINKING IN A TRAINING OF THE MIND BUT IT ISN'T LIKE LATIN IT'S A VERY UNIQUE WAY I CAN COULD CREATE AN ALGORITHM A MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHM TO TRANSLATE LATIN INTO ENGLISH THAT'S EASY BUT THE WAY OF THINKING MATHEMATICALLY AND IT'S ONE THAT WE NEED MORE AND MORE BECAUSE WE'RE INCREDIBLY DATA RICH AGE WE HAVE THE POWER OF ALGORITHMS A TILE FINGERTIPS NOW TIM AND WE'VE GOT A CONCERT TICKETS YES BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT COMPUTER IS DOING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS IS IMPORTANT TO MY BUSINESS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT
WHAT CAN IT DO THAT'S THE POINT ABOUT LEARNING THESE TWOS YEAH A QUADRATIC EQUATION WHO EVER IS GOING TO USE A QUADRATIC EQUATION IN THEIR EVERY DAY LIFE BUT THEIR WAY OF THINKING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE'S A PATTERN HERE WHICH WILL APPLY WHATEVER THE DATA THAT I CAN ACTUALLY APPLY THIS ALGORITHM AND I UNDERSTAND THE METHOD WHICH IS GOING TO GET ME TO A RESULT AND I DON'T NEED TO BE CONFUSED BY THE DATA THAT I THINK IS INCREASINGLY GOING TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL FOR FOR ANYBODY GOING INTO ANY WALK OF LIFE SIMON IF THAT'S WHAT IT GOES THAT IS USEFUL
I MEAN IT'S USEFUL TO KNOW THE CHEMISTRY OF PETROL TO DRIVE A CAR I SPENT ONE SUMMER WE GET THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT KNOWING THE CHEMISTRY PETROL AND THESE ARE VERY SPECIALISED SKILL I'M NOT DONETTE DENIGRATE HIM OUT SO REALLY AM NOT I DID IT MYSELF IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SUBJECT IT WAS FASCINATED LIKE CHESS RULERS OF THE PATTERNS IN IT WE ARE DELIGHTFUL AND HARDY SAID IT IS A SUBJECT ON BEAUTY IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND THE IDEA OF MAKING IT COMPULSORY WHEN WE SING WITH THE PERCHANCE HAVE JUST GONE ON ABOUT CHILDHOOD A B. C. WANNA TEACH THEM ABOUT
BAD DIET ABOUT ABOUT THE BODY AND GIVES THE THINGS CHILDREN SUFFERING AT THE CREATURES NOT A ZERO SUM GAME NO IT'S NOT BUT THEY'RE THERE THE BIRDS EVERY TEACHER KNOWS THERE'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE DAY AND YOU GET DISENFRANCHISE IF YOU IF YOU AREN'T ABLE TO ANALYSE THE DATA THERE IT'S VERY EASY TO BE TO THINK THERE ARE PATTERNS THERE AND YOU NEED TO NOT HAVE THE TOOL EXAMPLE AT THE TOP WHAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IF I
DID A BET WITH YOU O.K. AND I'M GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO TOSS THE TEN COINS IN A ROW AND WILL YOU BET AGAINST ME THAT I THINK I CAN GET THREE HEADS OR THREE TAILS IN A RUNNER DO PROBABILITY PROBABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL IN BE ABLE TO ASSESS RISK OUT THERE SO I'VE GOT TO DO WHICH I'VE NEVER ENTER AT MATHS AGAIN I KNOW THAT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY I WAS RUBBISH AT MATHS I DON'T REMEMBER LEARNING THAT FROM MATHS RIGHT I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SIMON'S OFTEN MISSES IN THESE ARTICLES WHICH APPEAR EVERY TWO YEARS AND A NICE MATHEMATICAL PATTERN
WHICH IS THAT THE MATHEMATICS THAT WE'RE TEACHING I THINK HE'S MISSING OUT ON WHAT MIND MANNIX REALLY ISN'T IT MY KIDS IN THE CAR THIS MORNING WAS WHAT DAD YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IS TO LEARN MATHS STILL EIGHTEEN I SAID WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU WHAT MATTERS REALLY ABOUT AND I STARTED TO TELL SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF GOOGLE
GOOGLE ISN'T A LOAD OF GOOGLE ELVES SITTING THERE DOING YOUR SEARCH ENGINE AND IT'S AN AMAZING MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHM AND IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE WAY THAT ALGORITHM WORKS IT'S TRANSLATED TO GET SOMETHING THAT JUST THE GEEKS NEED TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS TOOL KIT YOU CAN APPLY IT IN THE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE RUNNING TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT INPUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT SURELY IS SOMETHING THAT A NATION NEEDS WE ARE AN OUTLIER AT THE MOMENT BUT BEING THE ONLY NATION AMONGST TWENTY FOUR THAT WERE SURVEYED THAT GIVE UP MATHS AT SIXTEEN
WELL WHY IS BRITAIN AND AMERICA THE TWO WORST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AT MATHS THE BEST AT SCIENCE I MEAN THE FACT IS THAT THIS IS THIS IS A CULT I THINK DEMOCRACY IS A PART OF BEING MATHS BLOBBY AND I APPRECIATE HIS RHETORIC AND BITS BUT BUT THE FACT IS THESE ARE NOT NECESSARY SUBJECTS THEY'RE FASCINATING THEY'RE A DELIGHT TO DO A LOT OF KIDS I KNOW HAVE HAD THEIR SCHOOLING WRECKED BY THEIR INABILITY TO DO MATHS SO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY ABOLISH MATHS TEACHER NO I WOULDN'T I'M RIGHT SO WHAT WILL YOU DO YOU'VE GOT TO DO ARITHMETIC MOST PEOPLE LEARN MATHS PLAYING DARTS OR BETTING
THAT'S HOW THEY LEARN THEY LEARN ON THE JOB THEY LEARN ABOUT PROBABILITY ABOUT RISK BUT PERCENTAGES PLAYING DARTS AND BETTING NOW I MEAN YOU TEED IT UP PLAYING A BETTING AS WELL THAT DON'T NEED TO RUN IT IN ONLY ONE LEG OVER BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH EDUCATION WHAT IS IMPORTANT WHAT ISN'T
AND A LOT OF SUBJECTS LIKE LATIN IN THE OLD DAYS LIKE MATHS NOW HAVE THAT QUITE CULT STATUS HUGE LOBBIES BEHIND THEM BIG MONEY BEHIND THEM IN ORDER TO IN SOME SENSE GET A CONTROL ON THE CURRICULUM AND THE CURRICULUM WHAT TO BE REVISED IN THE DIRECTION WAS USEFUL WHAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S CREATIVE AND I'M AFRAID MATHS ISN'T A MATHS IS ABOUT ANALYTIC THINKING AND IF YOU DON'T THINK ANALYTIC THINKING IS IMPORTANT IT'S NOT ABOUT ARITHMETIC
THAT'S A MISTAKE A LOT OF HEAT A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT ANALYTIC THINKING BUT HE'S NOT THAT SORT OF ANALYTIC THINKING THE MATHEMATICS DOES AND I THINK IT IS A UNIQUE SUBJECT FOR THAT BOBBY TIME AS PART OF ITS UNIQUE WHY DO WE ALL NEED TO DO BECAUSE IT'S A PRIZE IN NEARLY EVERY SUBJECT IT HAS THE SORT OF ANALYTIC THINKING THAT GIVES YOU THE EDGE IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND PUP A LOGICAL ARGUMENT FRONT EXAMPLE BEING ABLE TO STRING TOGETHER SEVERAL THAT'S WHAT MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT
PROOF AND SPOTTING PARALYSED PEOPLE WHO DO YOU WERE BRILLIANT WITH THAT THEN BRING IT OUT THIS LOT DOING MATHS BUT THEY ARE DOING THAT THAT'S THE POINT ALL RIGHT THEY'RE ONLY TO STUDY MATHS TO BE MATHEMATICAL IN THOSE THEY WERE ACHIEVED VERY MUCH WE HAVE ER THIRTEEN SECONDS AFTER THE END OF THIS PROGRAMME WAS THINK KIDS MARK AS A SORT OF THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH JONATHAN HARVEY LOUISA LOUIS I HAD ASSESS FROM JOHN ME GOOD MORNING
