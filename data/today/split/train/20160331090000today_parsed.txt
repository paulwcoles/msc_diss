A REVIEW OF END OF LIFE CARE IN ENGLAND SUGGESTS THAT TO MANY PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL DI THIRSTY AND IN PAIN AND ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME DO YOU YOU WILL EVEN PUNISHMENT FOR ABORTION YES YOU KNOW I WAS A PRINCIPAL AT THE EDGE HERE IS THERE
IT HAS TO BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR THE ONE
BUT THEN YOU TURNED ON THE SUBJECT OF ABORTION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PLUS
THE MILD WINTER BRITAIN'S LONG TAILED TITS INTO OUR GARDENS THAT WAS A VERY BRIEF EXCERPT OF ONE WHAT ELSE HAS BEEN AT THE BIRD TABLE WE WILL HEAR FROM THE R.S.P.B. PLUS THE EPIC FILM COMPOSER HANS ZIMMER ON HIS LESSER KNOWN WORK

THE NEWS READ BY DIANA SPEED DAVID CAMERON OR CHAIR AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF KEY MINISTERS AND DOWNING STREET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S OPTIONS FOR SAVING BRITAIN'S BIGGEST STEELMAKING COMPANY THE MEETING IS IN RESPONSE TO TATA STEEL'S DECISION TO SEEK BUYERS FOR ITS LOSS MAKING U.K. OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST STEEL PLANT AT PORT TALBOT IN SOUTH WALES A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
TA TA STEEL EMPLOYS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U.K. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER JOBS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE INDUSTRY BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO GRAPPLE TOO WITH A BIGGER STRATEGIC QUESTION IF RETAINING A STEEL INDUSTRY IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST HOW CAN IT BE DONE
THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAGEDE JAVID SAID HE DIDN'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT BUYING THE PLANTS WAS THE SOLUTION BUT ANY MORE SHORT TERM FINANCIAL SUPPORT COULD STILL BE EXPENSIVE AND WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH E.U. RULES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COUNTRIES DON'T SECURE AN ADVANTAGE BY PROPPING UP INDUSTRIES WITH TAXPAYERS' MONEY
NUCLEAR WASTE IS TO BE SENT FROM BRITAIN TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE BIGGEST SHIPMENT OF ITS KIND IN HER TURN URANIUM WILL BE DELIVERED TO EUROPE FOR USE IN MEDICINE THE DEAL WILL BE ANNOUNCED BY DAVID CAMERON AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIL NUCLEAR SECURITY TAKING PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE HERE'S OUR DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR JAMES LANDOR
THE PRIME MINISTER'S AIM IS TO SHOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW TO DISPOSE OF NUCLEAR WASTE HE WILL TELL WORLD LEADERS IN WASHINGTON THE BRITAIN WILL TRANSPORT SEVEN HUNDRED KILOGRAMS OF HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM TO THE UNITED STATES OFFICIALS SAID THIS WOULD BE THE LARGEST EVER SUCH MOVEMENT OF NUCLEAR WASTE WHICH THE U.S. HAS MORE CAPACITY TO STORE AND PROCESS
IN RETURN A DIFFERENT FORM OF USE GERANIUM WILL BE TRANSPORTED FROM AMERICA TO THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY WHERE IT WILL BE TURNED INTO RADIO ISOTOPES THAT ARE USED TO DETECT AND DIAGNOSED CANCER
A REPORT WHICH LOOKED AT END OF LIFE CARE SUGGESTS MANY HOSPITALS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE ROUND THE CLOCK SPECIALISTS TO LOOK AFTER PATIENTS THE STUDY REVERED REVIEWED THE CASES OF NINE THOUSAND PATIENTS AT THE MAJORITY OF N.H.S. TRUSTS IN ENGLAND IT SAYS IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE PREVIOUS APPROACH CALLED THE LIVERPOOL CARE PATHWAY WAS PHASED OUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT THEY ARE STILL UNACCEPTABLE VARIATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
UNDERSTEER INTERNATIONALS AS MIGRANT WORKERS BUILDING VENUES FOR THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO SYSTEMIC ABUSE WHICH AMOUNTS TO FORCED LABOUR IN SOME CASES THE QATARI GOVERNMENT AND FEVERS SAY THEY HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS BUT AUDREY GOT HUNG FROM AMNESTY SAYS MOST OF THE LABOURERS LIVED IN SQUALID CONDITIONS GET PAID LESS THAN PROMISED AND CAN'T LEAVE
THE KIND OF THREATS THAT WORKERS GET FROM EMPLOYERS DO IT DO WHAT WE WANT OR WE'LL REPORT YOU TO THE POLICE OR WE WILL GIVE YOU BACK YOUR PASSPORT AND LET YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY THAT'S THE CORE OF WHERE THERE'S A BIG RISK OF FORCED LABOUR FORCING PEOPLE TO WORK WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO
THE UN TRIBUNAL FOR WAR CRIMES IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IS TO DELIVER ITS VERDICT IN THE CASE OF THE ULTRA NATIONALIST SERBIAN POLITICIAN FOR A SLASH THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM INCLUDE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND RELATE TO THE FORCED REMOVAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CROATIANS ARE MUSLIMS FROM THEIR HOMES BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS WELL AS MURDER AND SEXUAL ASSAULT HE WON'T BE IN THE HAGUE FOR THE HEARING BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO BELGRADE FOR TREATMENT FOR CANCER
SCIENTISTS ARE TO CARRY OUT GENETIC TESTS ON TUMOURS FROM FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN WITH CANCER ACROSS THE U.K. THEY HOPE THE RESEARCH WILL ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP TARGETED TREATMENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP HAS PERFORMED A COMPLETE U. TURN ON ABORTION WITHIN HOURS OF SAYING THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE THEIR PROCEDURES SHOULD BE PUNISHED IF IT'S RE CRIMINALISED AFTER COMING UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES HE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE DOCTOR PERFORMING THE ABORTION SHOULD BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE NOT THE WOMAN FROM WASHINGTON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHNSON
ONE OF THE KEY DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE ABILITY OF THE PROPERTY BILLIONAIRE TO MAKE PROVOCATIVE AND OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS AND REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM THEM EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE PROVOKED AN OUTCRY
BUT NOT LAST NIGHT HAVING DECLARED HIMSELF AS PRO LIFE HE WAS PRESTON AND INTERVIEW ON WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED IF THEY WENT AHEAD WITH AN ABORTION AFTER HE'S HAD BEEN OUTLAWED YES HE SAID THEY SHOULD PRO CHOICE AND FEMINIST GROUPS CONDEMNED HIS REMARKS BUT MORE STRIKING WAS THE CRITICISM THAT CAME FROM CONSERVATIVE ANTI ABORTION GROUPS
FINDING HIMSELF COMPLETELY ISOLATED MISTER TRUMP DID SOMETHING HE HASN'T DONE THAT TOO HE ISSUED A STATEMENT REVERSING HIS POSITION
THE PENTAGON HAS TOLD THE U.S. CONGRESS THAT IT IS TO TRANSFER ABOUT A DOZEN DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO BAY TO HAVE THESE TWO COUNTRIES THAT HAVE AGREED TO TAKE THEM THEY ARE UNDERSTOOD TO INCLUDE A YEMENI MAN HE'S BEEN ON HUNGER STRIKE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN NINETY ONE PRISONERS ARE CURRENTLY HELD AT THE U.S. NAVAL BASE LAST MONTH'S PRESIDENT OBAMA SET OUT HIS GOAL TO CLOSE THE FACILITY BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE
THANK YOU DAINA AT SIX MINUTES PAST SIX TIME TO GO OVER TO THE B.B.C. WEATHER STENT STABBED HER NAILS HE'S WAITING FOR US THERE MORNING STUFF GOOD MORNING TO YOU NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING TO YOU AT HOME BUT A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL INFLUENCE OUR WEATHER TODAY MEANING PLENTY OF FINE DRY AND SETTLED WEATHER WITH SOME SUNSHINE BUT THERE WILL STILL BE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND A FEW COULD TURN OUT TO BE HEAVY LAST NIGHT AND THE MAINLY CLEAR SKIES AND WITH LIGHT WINDS TEMPERATURES PLUMMETED WITH A WIDESPREAD FROST FOR MANY
FOR ENGLAND AND WALES AWAY FROM THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND IT'S A COLD AND FROSTY START WITH A FEW MIST AND FOG PATCHES AROUND SOME DIM PRETTY DENSE ACROSS NORTH WEST ENGLAND THE MOMENT PARTICULAR FOR CUMBRIA BUT FOR MOST IT WILL BE A DRY BRIGHT AND SUNNY MORNING IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND THE HIGH CLOUD WILL GRADUALLY THIN TO LAUGH SUNSHINE TO APPEAR HERE AS WELL IT'S THE AFTERNOON CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP LIKE THIS IN YESTERDAY MORNING WITH A FEW SHOWERS DEVELOPING HOWEVER THERE WILL BE VERY WELL SCATTERED
PERHAPS THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SEEING THE MOST OF THEM AND MAYBE THE ODD HEAVY SLOW MOVING ONE TWO MUCH OF WALES THERE WILL REMAIN DRY WITH GOOD SUNNY SPELLS ALL DAY AFTER THAT COLD START TEMPERATURES WILL RISE NICELY IN THE LATE MARCH SUNSHINE TO REACH AROUND TEN TO FOURTEEN CELSIUS IN THE SOUTH
FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A COLD AND FROSTY START ESPECIALLY NORTHERN SCHOLAR WITH A FEW MIST AND FOG PATCHES THE CENTRAL BELT OF SCOTLAND STARTING OFF RATHER CLOUDY WITH A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS THESE WINTRY WITH SNOW OVER THE HILLS FOR A TIME THROUGH THE DAY MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY WITH SUNNY SPELLS BUT A FEW SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP THE ODD ONE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND THE FOCUS PERHAPS BEING ACROSS SOUTHERN SCOTLAND BUT THERE COULD BE A FEW HEAVY ONES TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN CELSIUS BUT CHILLY ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND
TOMORROW SEE A CHANGE A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BREAKS DOWN SIR WILL SEE WET AND WINDY WEATHER WITH GALES ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND THIS WET AND WINDY WEATHER PUSHING SOUTH AND EAST INTO NORTHWEST WALES AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND THROUGH THE DAY ELSEWHERE THOUGH STAYING DRY WITH SOME HAZY SUNSHINE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH STOVE IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEXLESS TURNED TO THE PAPERS THE FRONT MALE FRONT MALE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MAIL HAS A BANNER HEADLINE SHUM IN THEIR DYING HOURS THIS IS THE STORY REFERRED TO IN THE NEWS THAT DYING PATIENTS ARE ROUTINELY BEING LEFT DEHYDRATED AND IN PAIN DURING THEIR FINAL HOURS A SHOCKING REPORT REVEALS TODAY ACTUALLY AS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IN A FEW MINUTES THE REPORT IS NOT ALL
DOOM AND GLOOM BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES CONTAIN A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL BE DEEPLY UPSETTING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN RELATIVES WHO DIED RECENTLY IN HOSPITAL IN ENGLAND THOUSANDS DENIED FLUIDS AND MEDICATION THE MAIL SAYS AND IN SOME CASES DOCTORS ARE NOT EVEN TOLD THEIR RELATIVES THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO DIE AND ALL OF THIS IS A REPORT FROM THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THAT WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT YOU IN THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME
IT MAY BE A GOOD DAY FOR THE BUSINESS SECRETARY TO BE ON AN AEROPLANE AND NOT SEEING THE BRITISH PAPERS WHICH OF COURSE HE IS COS HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK FROM AUSTRALIA THE F.T. HEADLINE BATTLE TO SAVE U.K. STEEL MAKING US TATA SAYS THE BUSINESS WORTH NOTHING IT IS THE POLITICS THERE WHEN THE MESS IF YOU LIKE THAT IS PICKED UP BY MANY OF THE PAPERS SHAMBLES IS WHAT THE DAILY MAIL CALLS IT TASTROPHE YEARS HOW THE SUN DESCRIBES IT
THE TIMES CHAOTIC STAY OR RESPONSE BUT FORTY THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK IT QUOTES THE DIRECTOR THE FINANCE DIRECTOR OF TATA STEEL ARE SAYING THE COMPANY'S BRITISH ASSETS HAD A BOOK VALUE OF QUOTES ALMOST ZERO AND THE THINK TANK THE P. P. I
SAYING THAT UP TO FORTY THOUSAND JOBS COULD GO IN STEEL MAKING COMMUNITIES IN A BUYER WAS FOUND MANY MORE OF COURSE THAN TORTA EMPLOY BUT MANY PEOPLE DEPEND ON THEIR MONEY AND THEIR JOBS SEXIST BULLYING IN MIXED SCHOOLS IS INHIBITING GIRLS FROM PUTTING UP THEIR HANDS AND SPEAKING OUT IN CLASS BECAUSE THEY APPEAR
THEY FEAR A PAIRING SWOTTY AND CLEVER THIS IS ACCORDING TO A SENIOR TEACHERS LEADER IT'S IN THE GUARDIAN IN SEVERAL OTHER PAPERS AS ONE OF HER MARY BOOSTED GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS AND LECTURERS HAS SAID THAT SEXIST BULLYING IS STILL PREVALENT IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE GIRLS OFTEN FEEL UNDER PRESSURE TO KEEP QUIET AND LISTEN WHY BOYS TALK THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF PRESSURES ON GIRLS TO BE THIN TO BE ATTRACTIVE TO BE COMPLIANT
AND TO BE QUIET AND IT'S HAS GREAT NOW SHE SAYS AS IT HAS EVER BEEN QUICK WORD ABOUT THE CHAT BOT HEY REMEMBER IT PRODUCED A STREAM OF ABUSE BUT IT'S ALL GONE HAYWIRE AGAIN THE F.T. REPORTS THAT IT SAID YESTERDAY I BLAME IT ON THE ALCOHOL A MAN CALLED HUMPHREY THOUGH
I MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IT IN HE SAYS HE BLAMES EVERYBODY ELSE VANITY AND IN AMITY IT SAYS SELF HIS TWITTER AND THE DANGERS OF THE MOB TAKING OVER THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA ALSO PLANES AN HOUR OF AS THEY SAY AGAINST ALL HIS VIEWS FROM PEOPLE DOWN THE PUB
ANYWAY TEN PAST SIX NOW AS WE WERE AS I WAS READING TO YOU FROM THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MALE'S PRETTY APOCALYPTIC HEADLINES THIS MORNING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PEOPLE DYING IN HOSPITAL IN ENGLAND WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ADEQUATE WATER TO DRINK IN THEIR FINAL HOURS AND INDEED WHETHER THERE IS PROPER CARE FOR THEM IN A WIDER SENSE AS WELL SEEMS TO BE THE CENTRAL FINDING A ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OR REPORT THEM UNDERSTAND HEALTH REPORTER AND IS HERE BUT THE UNDERLYING PICTURE
SMEETA IS IS THAT ACTUALLY THINGS HAVE GOT BETTER YES THE REPORT ORTIS WOULD SAY THAT THINGS HAVE GOT MUCH BETTER IN ALL AREAS OF CARE NOW THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE EXPERTS HAVE REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AND SEE WHETHER THEY'VE GOT THINGS RIGHT SINCE THAT MASSIVE OVERHAUL OF END OF LIFE CARE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE LIVERPOOL CARE PATHWAY WERE SCRAPPED IT WAS CRITICISED FOR BECOMING A BIT MORE OF A TICK BOX APPROACH AND LEAVING PEOPLE TREATING THEM AS IF THEY WEREN'T INTO VISUALS IN SOME CASES LEAVING THEM WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER IN SOME CASES TOO
THEY SAY NOW THINGS HAVE GOT MUCH BETTER BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT WATER WHICH IS STAGGERING ISN'T IT SUCH A BASIC
THE ORSES WOULD SAY THAT ACTUALLY THAT IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING WATER BUT IN A THIRD OF CASES AT THE END OF LIFE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING ASSESSED FOR THEIR HYDRATION AND THEIR NUTRITION NEEDS AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES SO YES STILL PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THE HYDRATION THEY NEED AND KNOW STUCK IN A WIDER POINT THAT THAT REPORT MAKES THAT ACTUALLY THAT THEY'RE SHIED AWAY FROM IN HOSPITAL PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING IN THEIR FAMILIES
THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT PERHAPS THE COMMUNICATION ISN'T QUITE UP TO SCRATCH YET THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD THAT THEIR DEATH IS IMMINENT VERY DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAVING AND IN THE NINE THOUSAND CASE NEXT THEY LOOKED UP AND THERE WERE QUITE A FEW CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH ON THAT VERY DIFFICULT DISCUSSION
THROUGH THE MONTHS THANKS AND WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE SIDE TO HAVE US UP IT IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX SUPPORTERS OF THE EMBATTLED BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT DELMAR RECESS WILL HOLD A RALLY IN THE CAPITAL LATER TODAY TO PROTEST AGAINST AN IMPEACHMENT DRIVE BUT SHE'S DENOUNCED AS AN ATTEMPTED COUP AND BEEN TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN SAO PAULO LAURA BECA I ASKED WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT COULD SURVIVE THIS AND WHETHER IMPEACHMENT WAS AVOIDABLE
IT LOOKS VERY UNLIKELY THAT DUMA RECESS CAN SURVIVE RAN HER GOVERNMENT THERE IS ABOUT TO BE JUSTIN A FEW HOURS Y. PRO GOVERNMENT RALLY WE EXPECT THOUSANDS TO ATTEND THAT THEY HAVE IN THE PATCH
THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PART OF A CUBE IT THIS IS AN ORGANISED ATTEMPT TO OR VERSE THROUGH ORDEAL MARIA SETH AND HURT GOVERNING WORKERS' PARTY I THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR A PRESENT YOURSELF TO AVOID IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS
THE MAIN PARTY HER BIGGEST ALLY AND ALLY FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HAS NO BACKED AWAY AND IT LOOKS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL PERSUADE OTHER PARTIES TO SLOWLY BACK AWAY TOO BUT
CERTAINLY MEAN ALLY PRESIDENT THEY LOVE FORMER PRESIDENT LULA IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO TRY TO AVOID THAT SITUATION
HE EVEN HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH INTERNATIONAL MEDIA INTERNATIONAL MEDIA THAT HE THINKS WILL BE EASIER TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT BRAZILIAN MEDIA A BIASED AND HEAT THE SEA AND HAVE SAID WAS IN THE LAST FEW HOURS GREAT ATTEMPTED COUP THE INTERNATIONAL PRAYERS MIGHT BE MOST OBSESSED WITH THE OLYMPICS BACK THEN THE SPORTS MINISTERS ALREADY GONE WELL EXACTLY AND I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER
DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THAT INVESTIGATORS WITHIN THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL
INVESTIGATING ONE OLYMPIC VENUE AND WORK THE AIR HAS ACTUALLY HAD TO BE HALTED NOW THIS IS AN OLYMPIC VENUE THAT WILL HOLD THE RUGBY SEVENS THE B.M.X. AND WE ARE TOLD ME WE WERE TOLD JUST LAST WEEK BY OLYMPIC ORGANISERS THAT THIS CORRUPTION SCANDAL WILL NOT AFFECT THE GAME IS AND THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PER CENT I WAS TOLD CERTAIN
THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE READY AND WHEN I ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL THEY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ANY OF THE OLYMPIC VENUES WHERE INVOLVED BUT CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES INVOLVED IN BUILDING THE GAMES ARE ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED AS PART OF THIS HALL CORRUPTION SCANDAL THAT HAS EMBROILED IN A NUMBER OF LEADING BUSINESSES AND POLITICIAN
OH THAT WAS LAURA BIGGER ENDED WHO'S TALKING TO ME FROM TELLING A QUARTER PAST SIX TIME FOR THE BUSINESS WELL VERY IMPORTANT HIS BUSINESS USE TODAY THE STATISTICS FOR OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WILL COME WHICH WILL WE UNDERSTAND MAKE FOR GRIM READING BUT HERE'S THE QUESTION DOES IT MATTER OR THAT I DON'T HAVE PRE EMPTY THAT ANSWER ADJUST AND BUNKERS WERE ABOUT TO ASK A CHRIS HERE FOR HIS VIEWS YES THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS WHERE MORE MONEY FLOWS INTO THE COUNTRY THAN FLOWS OUT OF THE COUNTRY THE COMES IN
IT INCLUDES TRADE OF COURSE BUT ALSO PROFITS BEING REPATRIATED TO AND FROM BRITAIN BY MULTINATIONALS TODAY'S CURRENT ACCOUNT NUMBERS FOR THE FINAL QUARTER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW THAT WERE SIMPLY NOT PAYING OUR WAY IN THE WORLD AS ONE CHANCELLOR MIGHT DESCRIBE IT IT'S AN ISSUE WHICH BOTHERS THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND OTHER KEY POLICY MAKERS
MUCH MORE EPHEMERAL MUCH MORE FLOOR TOOL AND RELYING ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS
NOT OPTIMAL IN THERE IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT A MATHS ALWAYS IS THE CASE WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A FOURTH ONE YOU HAVE TO SNAKE KIRK COUNT
THAT'S MARK THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HE REFERS TO THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS I SUPPOSE HE MEANS THAT THERE TO PLUG THEIR CURRENT ACCOUNT GETS IT WE NEED TO BORROW AND ATTRACT INVESTMENT FROM OVERSEAS CHRIS HERE IS AN ECONOMIST WITH INVESTOR GOOD MORNING TO YOUR CHRISTENING LET'S ANSWER THE QUESTION DOES IT MATTER AT THAT BRITAIN HAS A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ISSUE
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT IS LARGE AND WERE EXPECTING IT TO BE LARGE IN THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN AT AROUND FOUR MAYBE EVEN UP TO FIVE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL SIZE OF THE ECONOMY IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE STRUCTURAL ISSUES WHEREBY TRADE DEFICITS HAVE PERSISTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND ALSO THE U.K.'S BORROWING A LOT OF MONEY FROM ABROAD GENERALLY
THAT SAID THOUGH THESE SORTS OF DEFICITS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME AND SO FAR AT LEAST THE U.K. HAS BEING OUT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE ITSELF THROUGH ATTRACTING INVESTMENT FROM ABROAD BEING ABLE TO BORROW MONEY FROM ABROAD SO THESE SORTS OF DEFICITS ALTHOUGH THEY LOOK A BIT SCARY
SEEM TO BE SUSTAINABLE AT LEAST FOR NOW SO WHY IS A MAJOR POLICY MAKER LIKE MARCONI AND OTHERS INCLUDING THE CHANCELLOR WORRIED ABOUT PAYING OUR WAY IN THE WORLD I IS THERE A THREAT THAT INVESTORS WOULDN'T BUY GOVERNMENT BONDS YES I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORRY ABOUT THE FIRST IS THAT SUDDENLY INVESTORS LOSE CONFIDENCE IN U.K. P.L.C. AND INDEED THE BANK OF ENGLAND
IN ITS STRESS TEST SCENARIOS THAT IMPOSES ON THE BANKS THOUGHT OF THIS KIND OF SCENARIO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT SAID THAT'S NOT REALLY A RISK THAT I SEE OR SOMETHING REARING ITS HEAD IMMEDIATELY ANOTHER THING THOUGH IS THAT IT POINTS TO BROADER IMBALANCES IN THE ECONOMY FOR EXAMPLE YOU KATE BORROWING A LOT OF MONEY FROM ABROAD AS THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR GRADUALLY BORIS LESS MONEY HAS IT'S GEORGE OSBORNE'S PLAN
THEN INCREASINGLY MIGHT THINK THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE TO BORROW MORE MONEY PERHAPS GET INTO MORE DEBT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE THE RECOVERY AND THAT'S ONE OF THOSE ISSUES ALONGSIDE THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT THAT WOULD LOOK TOWARDS A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR CONCERN IF NOT IN THE NEAR TERM PERHAPS OVER THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM A LOT TO DO A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH REBALANCING THE U.K. ECONOMY AWAY FROM CONSUMPTION AND BORROWING HER TOWARDS MANUFACTURING AND EXPORTING
IF THE ST TODAY'S STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE DEFICIT IS STILL AROUND FOR FIVE PERCENT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT AT ALL ARE WE
THE ECONOMY DOES HAVE SEVERAL IMBALANCES RELATED TO IT AND IN TERMS OF TURNING AROUND TRADE PROSPECTS IN TERMS OF THE U.K. BEING MORE OF AN EXPORTING NATION THE SOBERING STORIES ABOUT TATA STEEL IS ONE EXAMPLE TO SHOW THAT THIS IS A REAL CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW THE CONSUMER IS DOING A LOT OF LEGWORK IN TERMS OF DRIVING THE ECONOMY AS I SAY THAT ISN'T A MAJOR CONCERN AT LEAST FOR NOW BUT I SUPPOSE OVER THE LONGER TERM YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THE U.K. REALLY GAINING MORE GROUND IN TERMS OF EXPORT SECTORS PERHAPS NOT IN TERMS OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES PERHAPS IN MORE KIND OF HI TECH INDUSTRIES BUT IT STILL SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LIKE PEOPLE ARE SCRABBLING AROUND TO FIND A SILVER BULLET BEHIND THIS ARE REBALANCING THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE VERY BRIEFLY IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL THAT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OR THE CURRENT ACCOUNT OF SETTEE
SEE A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS GOING ON THE FIRST IS THAT SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR THE U.K. TO FINANCE ITS DEFICITS MIGHT BE RAISED A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO SEE EVEN A CLOSING IN THE DEFICIT FOR EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU MIGHT GET HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.K. PUSHING BACK ON U.K. DEMAND IT MIGHT ALSO LOWER DEMAND FOR IMPORTS
ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU MIGHT SEE A SHARP FALL IN THE POUND IN RESPONSE TO A BRECHT SET THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY EXPORTS POINTLESS ABSOLUTELY SO AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM YOU MIGHT EVEN SEE IF NOT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE DEFICIT BUT NOT REALLY FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AND THEY'RE A WHOLE LOAD OF UNCERTAINTIES IN TERMS OF HOW TRADE DEALS WOULD WORK OUT WITH THE REST OF THE
IT'S REALLY AN UNCERTAIN PICTURE IF THAT WERE TO TAKE PLACE THIS HERE THEY'RE FROM INVEST I THINK ARE VERY MUCH LET ME STAY WITH THAT SUBJECT AND BRING IN RICHARD JEFFREY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER A CHASM OF CAPITAL MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU RICHARD MORNING DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS THAT WE HAVE A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH CAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO GO AWAY
I THINK IT CAN MATTER BECAUSE IT'S A SYMPTOM OF THE PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS VERY SIMPLY AND THIS IS A NATIONAL ACCOUNTS TERMS THAT THE U.K. ECONOMY IS SPENDING MORE THAN ITS EARNING AND IT HAS TO BORROW TO FINANCE THAT OR IT HAS TO SELL ASSETS TO FINANCE THAT AND I THINK THIS BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE U.K. BUSINESS MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN TO ATTRACT IN WAS INVESTMENT DEVELOP BUSINESSES AND THEN QUITE OFTEN SELL THOSE BUSINESSES ON OVERSEAS AGAIN
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO DISRUPT THAT MODEL THEN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT COS IT CAN WEIGH VERY HEAVILY ON THE CURRENT SCENE YOU HAVE TO BORROW TO FINANCE IT THAT IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT WE WANT TO SEE OURSELVES IN I JUST HAVE ONE FOR THE CAVIAR I'M NOT SURE A HOLY TRUST THE FIGURES THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS HAS REAL PROBLEMS
WE SEE ENORMOUS REVISIONS TO THESE NUMBERS SOMETIMES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE DATA IS ALL THAT IT APPEARS TO BE HAIR O.K. LET'S BRING ON IN BRING ON THE ATTACK TO STEAL STORY BECAUSE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE A VERY OPEN ECONOMY AND YOU CAN COME IN AND INVEST WHERE YOU WANT TO STEAL OF COURSE BOUGHT CHORUS WHICH WAS BRITISH STEEL DO YOU THINK THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE CITY BIG BY OUR COMPANIES THAT MIGHT BE LOOKING AT TAKING BITS OF TAT US DEAL
WELL THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE I THINK I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER REFLECTION OF HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO
RUN LOW LOWER MARGIN MASS MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES IN IN THE WEST WITHOUT SUBSIDIES AND YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE VERY VULNERABLE AND WE ARE VULNERABLE OBVIOUSLY TWO TO CHINESE PRODUCTION I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT IT'S NOT BEEN DUMPED ON THAT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE EUROPEAN UNION NEEDS TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUT IF IF THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND THEN IT'S SOMETHING SIMPLY A REFLECTION OF THE DIFFICULTY OF TO COMPETE KURT TO COMPETE IN THESE AREAS
THERE MAY BE SPECIALIST PARTS OF THE BUSINESS WHICH ARE VIABLE LONGER TERM OR THERE MAY BE STRATEGIC REASONS FOR WANTING TO KEEP A STEEL BUSINESS AT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO THINK ABOUT BUT CAN BRITISH STEEL PRODUCTION BE COMPETITIVE IN A WORLD MARKET I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY NEW BUYER TO COME IN THEY HAVE GOT TO IMMEDIATELY BE WILLING TO PUT CASH INTO THAT BUSINESS BOTH TO KEEP IT AFLOAT IN THE SHORT TERM AND OF COURSE TO INVEST FOR THE FUTURE O.K. LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR PREMIERE FOOD'S ANOTHER BID CAME IN
FOR PREMIER FOOD MAKES BESTOW AND MISTER KIPLING CAKES ECCENTRICS ETCHER FROM MCCORMICK AND THE AMERICAN HERBS AND SPICE MAKER SHARES HAVE SOARED IN THE LAST WEEK BY NINETY PERCENT WILL THEY DO A DEAL I PRESUME THEY'RE IN PLAIN AND WILL BE SOLD TO SOMEBODY
I THINK THERE'S NOW A LOT OF PRESSURE ON PREMIER FOODS TO TO HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH WITH THE BIDDER I THINK THE PRICES IS JUDGED TO BE A FAIR ONE IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK FOR FOR BOTH SIDES THAT TO LIFT THE BONNET AS IT WERE FOR FOR PREMIER FOODS TO SHOW WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE BONNET BONNET AND FOR A MCCORMICK TO HAVE A LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WELL OK'D IT IS WORTH A BID OR IT ISN'T BUT IT DOES LOOK AS IT IS IF THIS IS THE START OF THE END GAME FOR PREMIER FOODS
SURPRISING TO SEE THAT AS AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY IN THAT IN A FEW MONTHS' TIME O.K. RICHARD JEFFREY THERE FROM CASANOVA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT THANKS FOR JOINING US HERE'S A QUESTION YOU DON'T OFTEN GET A TWENTY PAST SIX WHAT IF YOU KNEW HOW LONG YOU HAD TO LIVE AND MANY OF US PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW BUT INSURERS AND PENSION PROVIDERS PROBABLY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THEY ALREADY CRUNCH A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA TO DETERMINE OUR LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ANNUITIES
BUT NOW A NEW FOUR YEAR PROJECT HAS BEEN LAUNCHED TO PREDICT LIFE EXPECTANCY IN PARTICULAR HOW IT IS EFFECTED BY CERTAIN DISEASES AND TREATMENTS AND PROFESSOR ELLEN ELLINA CULLEN SKY HERE IS THE PROJECT'S LEAD RESEARCHER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA GOOD MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR BUT ONE INTRA O. KAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING HIM TO GATHERING DATA WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO FIND
WELL WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRE COULD BE YOU'VE GOT A CHUNK OF DATA FROM A GENERAL PRACTITIONERS FOR HER TEAM PHIL'S DATA WHICH COMES YOUR AUNT'S AT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WANT BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY AND WE'RE HOPING TALL UNDERSTAND HOW PARTICULAR HEALTH CONDITIONS AND ALSO LIFESTYLE FOG TO US AND OUR TREATMENTS WARD A FACTORY LIFE EXPECTANCY OH KAY I WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE DATA AND IN TERMS OF WHO DO YOU GIVE IT TO
WE DON'T GIVE THE DATA TO ANYBODY DATA ALREADY EXIST WHAT WE DO IS WEIGH BREAM ADDITIONAL WAY LOOK AT THE STATE BY SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS OF COURSE WE WOULD PUBLISH THE RESULTS AND WHEREAS UP AN EXCESS DRAW OS AND WE'RE ALSO HOPING TO CREATE SOME SOFTWARE WHICH WILL BE WHERE DIBBLE FREELY FROCKS I WEPT
AND WHO WOULD BE UNFAIR SLIGHTLY CYNICAL TO SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE ANNUITIES WANTED TO DIE YOUNG AND PEOPLE WHO SELL YOU PENSIONS WANTS YOU TO LIVE FOREVER WELL I WOULDN'T PUT IT LIKE THAT BUT ER INSURANCE DON'T NEED TO DRAW NO I NEVER AVERAGE WHAT IS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF PEOPLE SO ENSURE OTHERWISE EH WARD
SIMPLY RUN OUT OF MONEY IT WAS THEY MUST COOK AT THE HEAT AND YOUR YOUR ANALYSIS WHEN IT'S PUBLISHED DO YOU THINK IT'LL AFFECT INSURANCE PREMIUMS
I THINK IT MIGHT END IT WOULD BE A CHILL OF BENEFIT WHAT GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE IF WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN I MEAN IF WE'RE NO BETTER WE WANT TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE AT DECIDING ANSWER THAT'S BRILLIANT LOOK AT THE FINALLY IT ISN'T ETHICAL ASPECT OF THIS I SHOULD WE BE TRYING TO PREDICT WHEN PEOPLE DIE
AH WELL I SUPPOSE THERE ARE TWO POINTS IF YOU ANSWER SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO KNOW BUT I'VE GOT A LOOK WHICH MIGHT PREFER A CHALK YOU HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT MY LIFE EXPECTANCY BECAUSE I WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAN MUCH BETTER FOR MY RETIREMENT FOR EXAMPLE

WELL THEY RANGE FROM SECURING SOME SORT OF MYSTERY BUYER WHO COMES GALLOPING OVER TO PICK UP THE TART OR PLANTS TO SOME FORM OF STATE INTERVENTION RANGING FROM FAIRLY MINIMAL INTERVENTION ALL THE WAY UP TO MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDY IS UNDERWRITING LOANS SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT THE DIFFICULTY THEY GOT
AND COMING UP WITH A CLEAR COHERENT PLAN IS THEY ARE TO SOME EXTENT IN LIMBO LAND WAITING FOR TARTARE TO TELL THEM HOW LONG THEY'VE GOT BECAUSE IF TART OR STICK TO WHAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR CURRENT APPROACH OF PRESSING FOR A SWIFT SALE WITHIN WEEKS THAT MAKES IT EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO COME UP WITH A BUYER NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS GIVES THE BUYER A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE GOVERNMENT'S GOT A GUN TO ITS HEAD
IF THEY CAN'T GET AN EXTENSION OF THAT TIME FRAME AND THEY CAN'T FIND A BUYER THEN INEVITABLY THEY GET PUSHED TOWARDS SOME SORT OF TEMPORARY STATE ROLE IN KEEPING THE PLANTS GOING WHILE THEY CONTINUE THEIR SEARCH FOR A BUYER AND THAT
YOU KNOW REALLY HARD PART ABOUT THIS IT SEEMS TO ME AS THAT EXPECTATIONS NOW HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE BUSINESS SECRETARY AND THE BUSINESSMAN ASTANA SOON BUT WHO HAVE IN EFFECT SAID LOOK WE MUST SAVE THE STEEL INDUSTRY DOING IT THOUGH IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT AND AMONG MINISTERS AS WELL THERE'S
NO AGREEMENT IS THERE ABOUT WHAT THE BEST OPTIONS MIGHT BE I THOUGHT INTERESTING YESTERDAY THAT SLUDGY JAVID WHEN HE EVENTUALLY DID SPEAK ABOUT THE CRISIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW UP TO LUNCHTIME YESTERDAY WE WERE TOLD HE WOULDN'T BE COMMENTING ON HER BUT WHEN HE DID HE
COMPLETELY QUASHED THE IDEA OF NATIONALISATION WHICH THE BUSINESS MINISTER A SUE BREE DID NOT ENTIRELY RULE OUT SHE SAID ALL OPTIONS WERE ON THE TABLE I THINK THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT IT'S JUST FAR TOO COSTLY GIVEN THE PLANTERS LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY BUT INEVITABLY THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THOSE WHO WOULD TOWARDS A MORE MARKET BASED SOLUTION AND THOSE WHO THINK THE GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE A ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING KEY INDUSTRIES BUT IN DOING THAT
MINISTERS RUN INTO THE OTHER BIG BUFFER APART FROM COST AND THAT IS E.U. REGULATIONS WHICH SEVERELY CURB THE ABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO GET DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN SUBSIDISING ALL SUPPORTING ANY INDUSTRY
SO YOU KNOW THE PRESSURE IS ENORMOUS FINDING A CLEAR PLAN
IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT WE'LL BE TALKING TO JON MOULTON VENTURE CAPITALIST JUST AFTER SEVEN AND LEN MCCLUSKEY JANACEK TO UNITE AFTER EIGHT NORMAN SMITH THANKS IT IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN SCIENTISTS ARE BEGINNING TO WORK BEGINNING WORK TO GENETICALLY TEST TUMOURS FROM CHILDREN WITH CANCER THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL GIVE YOUNGER PATIENTS ACCESS TO NEWER MORE TARGETED MEDICINES WITH BETTER CHANCES OF SUCCESS AND FEWER SIDE EFFECTS THAN CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT
THE TESTING IS BASED IN LONDON IT'LL REACH FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN FROM AROUND THE U.K. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER HAS THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT
CANCER IS RARE IN CHILDREN BUT WHEN IT STRIKES IT CAN BE DEVASTATING IT'S A BIG SHOCK TO FIND OUT THAT YOUR CHILD HAS BRAIN CANCER YOU DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE YOU DON'T REALISE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF REPERCUSSIONS FROM
HELEN DAILY SON JACK WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN TUMOUR AT THE AGE OF SEVEN HE'S NOW FOURTEEN WITH KEEN INTEREST'S IN GRAPHIC DESIGN AND DOCTOR WHO JACK'S CANCER HAS GONE BUT THE AFTER EFFECTS OF HIS RADIOTHERAPY REMAIN MY MOTOR SKILLS AREN'T GET I CAN'T I I HAVE TO HAVE HELP FROM MY MUM IN THE MORNING TO GET DRESSED FOR SCHOOL AND MY BALANCE ISN'T GOOD I WAS CLUMSY AND I THOUGHT I EVER
I JUST STRUGGLE AT SCHOOL A LOT WHICH ALSO IF FRIENDSHIPS GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE SOMETIMES AND I GET VERY DEPRESSED
ANXIOUS AND SAD SOMETIMES BUT IT IS
AT A LABORATORY AT THE ROYAL MARSDEN N.H.S. HOSPITAL IN LONDON SCIENTISTS HOPE FEWER CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE WE'LL HAVE JACKED DALEY'S EXPERIENCE THEY'RE ANALYSING TUMOURS FROM YOUNG PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GENETIC CHANGES WHICH DRIVE THE SPREAD OF CANCER
PROFESSOR LOUIS CHESLER FROM THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH EXPLAINS WHY CHILDREN NEED A SPECIFIC APPROACH CHILDREN OFTEN DO NOT HAVE
EQUAL ACCESS TO THE MOST MODERN AND POTENTIALLY THERAPEUTICALLY THEN OFFICIAL CANCER DRUGS THE PROBLEM FOR HER CHILDREN AS THAT THANKFULLY PAEDIATRIC TUMOURS ARE VERY RARE UNFORTUNATELY THE CAST OF DEVELOPING THESE JEAN TARGET DRUGS WAS VERY
THE COST BENEFIT RATIO THEREFORE FOR A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES HAVE TO DEVELOP THESE DRUGS
IS VERY DIFFICULT AS I FIRST CHRISTMAS YEAH AND I DON'T THINK HE COULD SIT UP COMPLETELY THEY KEPT FALLING OVER AND ANY IS THAT THAT HE WAS ON THE FLOOR ONCE
KAREN AND KEVIN CABLES ONLY CHILD CHRISTOPHER DIED FROM AN AGGRESSIVE BRAIN TUMOUR SHORTLY BEFORE HIS SIXTH BIRTHDAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND DATES AS WINDSOR GREAT I WAS WINDSOR GREAT PARK AND THEY'D RUN AROUND THAT MUCH I THINK HE FELL ASLEEP ON THE WAY BACK THEY'VE CHANNELLED THEIR GRIEF INTO THE CHARITY THEY SET UP IN HIS MEMORY CHRISTOPHER SMILE
THE CABLES WORK HAS RAISED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO HELP DEVELOP THE NEW GENETIC TEST THIS IS THE FIRST REAL STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE TOWARDS PERSONALISED MEDICINE TO CHILDREN
WE WANT TO SEE CHILDREN TREATED WITH TARGETED TREATMENTS IT'S CLEVER SCIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN
NOT TO CONTINUE USING DRUGS THERE ARE OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD IN SOME INSTANCES WHICH WAS THE BEST THAT OUR SON HAD
AND IN THE MAIN THAT'S THE BEST THAT STILL OUT THERE TODAY FOR CHILDREN AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE CHANGE
THAT REPORT WAS FROM JANE DRAPER MORE ON THAT AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT THE TIME NOW IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS IT'S UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF FORCED LABOUR ON CONSTRUCTION SITES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WELL DEATH CUP IN CUT OUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP HAVE SPOKEN TO OVER TWO HUNDRED MIGRANTS WORKING ON A STADIUM AND A SPORTING FACILITY THE B.B.C.'S MARTIN BELL
HE'S HERE WHAT DO THEY DISCOVER WE'RE JUST AN OVER THE PAST YEAR THIS GROUP OF AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MALE MOSTLY BANGLADESHI INDIAN A NEPALESE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND GARDENERS THAT SPOKE TO AMNESTY HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR LIVING IN THE CITY OF DO HARA HOST CITY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO FEE FOR WORLD CUP AND WHAT HAS UNITED THEM
IS THAT THEY'VE ALL HAD TO EITHER PAY OFF LARGE FEES BEEN LIED TO ABOUT THEIR WORK HAD THEIR PASSPORTS REMOVED LIVED IN POOR ACCOMMODATION OR SUBJECTED TO FORCED LABOUR ALL IN THE CITY WITH THE HIGHEST PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE WORLD AND WHAT MAKES THESE FINDINGS EVEN MORE WORRYING IS THAT DESPITE INTENSE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO IMPROVE STANDARDS GENERALLY IN THE COUNTRY INCLUDING EXPOS EH YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ON THE ALARMING NUMBER OF NEPALESE MIGRANT WORKERS DYING BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN
AND EVEN A GOVERNMENT SPONSORED TRIP LAST YEAR FOR ASKED THE MEDIA TO VISIT THE STADIUM THESE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS LABOURERS WORK AT OR AROUND AND HAS STILL BEEN ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY GATHER THIS CONCERNING TESTIMONY OVER MANY MONTHS AND IT'S PARTICULARLY EMBARRASSING TO COME FROM WORLD CUP RELATED WORKERS AND ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE POOR HOUSING AND PORK A PASSPORT CONFISCATION ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AMONGST SOME OF THE CONTRACTORS THEY HAVE BEEN THESE ALARMING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE WON'T TURN THE QATARI GOVERNMENT SAYS A FAITHER SAYS IS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO IMPROVE THINGS WHAT'S HAPPENING
WELL THEY SAY THAT THEY TAKEN MEASURES TO IMPROVE THINGS BUT CERTAINLY AMONGST SUB CONTRACTORS THESE WORRYING FINDINGS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE AND ENFORCING WHAT'S GOING ON AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THINGS COULD GET WORSE BECAUSE THE QUESTION FEE AND THE QATARI GOVERNMENT HAVE TO ANSWER IT IS IF THEY WANT TO AS YOU SAY THIS WORLD UP TO ACT AS A CATALYST FOR CHANGE ARE NOT IN THERE WAS TO BE BUILT ON THE BACK
HAVE EXPLOITED WORKERS IS HOW THEY'LL ENSURE THAT THE STAND IS THAT THEY SET OUT TO BE A FORCE NOT JUST AMONGST THE FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS THAT THEY ARE WORKING AT THE MOMENT BUT WHEN THIRTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS JOIN THE WALK UP PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THERE'S THIS KIND OF REPORT CHANGE AND I THINK I MEANT
COS WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING AT THAT IT HASN'T CHANGED THINGS IN THERE THAT THE BROAD SWATHE OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT IS THERE A REALISTIC CHANCE THAT AT LEAST THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO THEIR CONDITIONS
IT SEEMS TO HELP BECAUSE THREE OF THE FOUR COMPANIES NAMED IN THE AMNESTY REPORT ARE NOW BANNED FROM WORLD CUP PROJECTS UNTIL THEY ESSENTIALLY CLEAN UP THEIR ACT AND PROVE THEY CAN ENSURE THE GOVERNMENT'S WELFARE STANDARDS ARE IMPLEMENTED A FOURTH COMPANY SAID TO HAVE CORRECTED ITS BEHAVIOUR SO REMAINS ON THE BOOKS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO WHETHER THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE AMNESTY FINDINGS OR BECAUSE A QATARI GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE HAD SPOTTED THE CHANGES FIRST BUT I THINK CERTAINLY
THERE'S PRESSURE ON THEM TO ENFORCE THEIR STANDARDS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT
WHY WHAT WOULD STOP THEM AND IT'S PHYSICAL MANPOWER IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH INSPECTORS TO GO AROUND THE COUNTRY AND CHECK OUT EVERY
SUB CONTRACTOR THAT'S BROUGHT IN AT SHORT NOTICE TO HAVE FOR THE GARDENERS OR FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO PUT THE CRATE SMALL PLASTIC
PARTS OF A CHAIR AND IT'S STRANGE TO BELIEVE THAT A COUNTRY'S RICHEST CUTTER AND WITH THE BACKING OF FEE FOR DOESN'T HAVE THAT BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
AMNESTY HAS FOUND MARK THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS ALMOST ALL OF THEM OF COURSE DISCUSSED THE POTENTIAL REPERCUSSIONS OF THE DECISION BY TATA STEEL TO SELL ITS U.K. BUSINESS ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THE MOOD AMONGST EMPLOYEES IS ONE OF INCREDULITY THE MINISTERS ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THE BANKING BAIL OUT AND COMMITTING TO A STATE FUNDED RESCUE THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNITE UNION LEN MCCLUSKEY WILL BE HEARING FROM HIM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
HIS ROLE AS WRITTEN IN THE MIRROR URGING DAVID CAMERON TO HEAR THE CHORUS OF CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE A STAKE IN STEEL THE ALTERNATIVE HE ARGUES HIS JOB'S GOING SHOPS SHUTTING AND HOPE TURNING TO DESPAIR BUT THE BUSINESS ADVISER ROGER HARROP TELLS NEW DAY WE WOULD BE MUCH BETTER ALLOWING IT TO GO AND LET A NEW INDUSTRY SUCH AS PHARMACEUTICALS GROW FINANCIAL TIMES AGREES AND SAYS NATIONALISATION ON LONG TERM STATE ASSISTANCE SUCH AS BLOCKING
CHEAP IMPORTS IS LIKELY TO BE IN A FACTUAL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE HAMISH MCRAE WRITING IN THE EYE ARGUES THAT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT NOW IS TO HELP COMMUNITIES MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH WHAT INEVITABLY WILL BE A WRENCHING CHANGE THE TERMINALLY ILL OR BEING SHUNNED IN THEIR DYING HOURS ACCORDING TO THE LEAD STORY IN THE MAIL THE PAPER WHICH HAS BEEN RUNNING A CAMPAIGN CALLED DIGNITY FOR THE ELDERLY SAYS THE AUDIT OF END OF LIFE CARE BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS IS DEVASTATING IT EXPOSES HOW SOME HOSPITALS NEGLECT THE TERMINALLY ILL
THE GUARDIAN REPORTS OF THE CARE OF PEOPLE DYING IN HOSPITAL HE'S BETTER SINCE THE SO CALLED LIVERPOOL CARE PATHWAY WAS ANNEXED THE PEOPLE ARE NOT RECEIVING GOOD PALLIATIVE CARE OVERNIGHT OR AT THE WEEKEND AND SON CALLS THE REPORT SHOCKING A SENIOR NURSE TELLS THE PAPER PEOPLE CROSS THE ROAD TO AVOID TALKING TO SOMEONE
HE'S ACTUALLY DYING OR BEREAVED MARKS AND SPENCER'S IN THE DOCK WITH THE FRENCH ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH OVER THE INTRODUCTION OF A BODY COVERING BURKIE NICE SWIMSUIT THE PAPER SAYS THE REACTION HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF A STATE ANNOUNCEMENT OF M.S. AFTER THE FRENCH WOMEN'S RIGHTS MINISTER LAWRENCE ACCUSED THE RETAILER OF HELPING TO LOCK UP WOMEN'S BODIES AND THE FASHION MOLE PIERRE BERGE SAID THAT TREND PROMOTED THE ENSLAVEMENT OF WOMEN MARKS
PROMOTES A WIDE RANGE OF SWIMWEAR AND AT THE THREE PIECE SUIT IS POPULAR WITH CUSTOMERS SCIENTISTS TO STUDY AN ITALIAN VILLAGE WHERE THREE HUNDRED RESIDENTS HAVE LIVED TO THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED THE EXPRESS REPORTS TO FIND THE SECRET OF A LONG DISEASE FREE LIFE
ONE OF THOSE LEADING THE RESEARCH ALAN MICE ALL AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE TELLS THE TELEGRAPH I THINK A COMBINATION OF A MEDITERRANEAN DIET DAILY EXERCISE AND EXTENSIVE USE OF THE HERB ROSEMARY HAVE HELPED EXTEND THE LIFE OF PEOPLE HIDDEN EIGHT YEAR ROLY ROSEMARY WAS INTRODUCED TO BRITAIN IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY THE MALE TELLS ITS READERS AND ALREADY HAS A REPUTATION FOR IMPROVING
MEMORY NO I COULD HAVE THE TIMES LINGUISTICS RESEARCHERS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE DISCOVERED THE GRAMMAR PEDANT SOME MORE LIKELY TO BE INTROVERTED A DISAGREEABLE TEAM FOUND THAT THOSE WHO WERE BOTHERED BY ERRORS IN A POORLY WRITTEN FAKE ADVERT WERE MORE LIGHTLY THEMSELVES TO HAVE NEGATIVE PERSONALITY TRAITS IT IS A COURSE OF SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING DAVID CAMERON IS TO CHAIR AN EMERGENCY MEETING HER MINISTERS TO DISCUSS HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN HELP TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF TATA STEEL'S PLANTS IN THE U.K.
NOW THE HOBBIT IS AN AWFUL LOT OLDER THAN WE THOUGHT AND WHAT'S MORE WE MIGHT ALL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HIM IN ARTS THIS IS NOT TOLKIEN'S HOBBIT OF COURSE BUT HOMO FLU ROSSI INSISTS JUST A MEAT AT ALL
WHO WE THINK WAS PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BY HOMO SAPIENS ARE RATHER MORE SOPHISTICATED EXPLANATION WILL NOW FOLLOW FROM PROFESSOR CHRIS STRINGER WHO'S A RESEARCHER IN HUMAN ORIGINS AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR STRING WHAT DO WE KNOW NOW ABOUT THE SO CALLED HOBBIT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE
WELL YES AS YOU SAID THE AGE OF IT SO IT'S MUCH OLDER THAN WE THOUGHT THE VIEW WAS THAT IT COULD HAVE DIED OUT AS RECENTLY AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS ALWAYS PUZZLING BECAUSE WE KNOW MODERN HUMANS WERE RIGHT ACROSS INDONESIA AND EVEN IN AUSTRALIA MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO SO IT WAS ODD THAT THIS CREATURE HAD SURVIVED IN ISOLATION SURROUNDED BY MODERN HUMANS FOR SO LONG NOW THE AGE HAS GONE BACK TO AT LEAST
FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE ASSOCIATED STONE TOOLS AND AT LEAST SIXTY THOUSAND YEARS FOR THE KNOWN FOSSILS OF COMMON FOR US SHE INSISTS THAT THE INTEREST IN THIS AM MY RIGHT IS HOW HOMO SAPIENS SAW OFF FIRST THE NEANDERTHALS AND MAYBE ALSO THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW DID THEY DO IT
WELL YES SO THAT WAS DEFINITELY DISAPPEARED PHYSICALLY SOON AFTER FORTY THOUSAND YEARS THERE'S CREATURES CALLED THE DO MISS EVANS WHO WERE OVER IN SIBERIA AND PROBABLY SOUTH EAST ASIA THEY HAVE GONE ON AS WELL WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN AND SO IT WAS ODD THAT THIS CREATURE HAD SURVIVED SO MUCH LONGER AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHY IT DIED OUT BUT THE ARRIVAL OF MODERN HUMANS IN THE AREA AROUND FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO CERTAINLY LOOKS
TO ME MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE NOW I'M SURE THERE WAS A RELATIONSHIP BUT HOW MUCH WE OVERLAP WITH THEM HOW WE INTERACTED WITH THEM IS UNCERTAIN AND YOU MENTIONED THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERBREEDING YOU CERTAINLY COULDN'T RULE IT OUT IF THEY HAVE A LAP GIVEN THAT PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY HAVE GOT NEANDERTHAL D.N.A. SOME OF US AND SOME OF US EVEN A SMALL GROUP HAVE DINNERS SYMON D.N.A. SO IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT IN THE REGION THERE COULD BE REMNANTS OF OF
HOBBIT D.N.A. IN SOME MODERN HUMANS WE KNOW OUR NAME UP AGAIN ABOUT HIS VERY SHORT THIS IS A SHORT SORT OF HOME BEING WHAT ABOUT THE FLORIAN SIS THIS IS FROM THE ISLAND NEAR INDONESIA WHERE THEY'VE BEEN DOING EXCAVATIONS TO TRY TO GET THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY
THAT'S RIGHT YES SO THE SITE'S BEEN DUG NOW FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND THE EARLY WORK WAS WAS EXCELLENT BUT THEY WERE DIGGING QUITE SMALL EXPOSURES AND UNKNOWN TO THEM IN THOSE EXPOSURES CAVES BEEN QUITE COMPLICATED PLACES THE SEDIMENTS ACTUALLY WHERE THEY WERE DIGGING WERE HAVE QUITE DIFFERENT AGES RIGHT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER THEY TOOK THE YOUNGER DATES AS BEING THE MOST RELIABLE IT TURNS UP WITH FURTHER WORK
THAT THE THE HOBBIT MATERIAL AND THE ASSOCIATED ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE EXTINCT ANIMALS ASSOCIATED ALL OF THEM ARE MUCH OLDER AND SO THIS DOES GIVE US I THINK A CLEARER PICTURE OF BOTH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THROWERS HE INSIST AND OF COURSE THE ARRIVAL OF MODERN HUMANS RIGHT ACROSS THAT REGION PROFESSOR STRINGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIMES TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN CLAIM AND COUNTER CLAIM STARK WARNING FOLLOWED BY ACCUSATION OF FEAR MONGERING THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM POLITICIANS THIS WEEK SLUGGING IT OUT IN THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SO A RELIEF WELL PERHAPS A RELIEF TO HEAD DIRECTLY FROM VOTERS AND GEM IS IN INVERNESS THIS MORNING TO DO JUST THAT HELLO JIM
GOOD MORNING JUST AS MANY LISTENERS WILL KNOW WE'RE GOING ROUND THE COUNTRY JUST TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS TO BE TRYING TO GET THE VIEWS OF THOSE WHO ARE UP AND ABOUT FAMILY ABOUT TO WORK WHILE WE ARE ON THE AIR JUST GET A FEELING FOR THE ARGUMENT OVER EUROPE AROUND THE COUNTRY I'LL BE TALKING TO THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THREE PAIRS AS IT WERE ONE
AND ONE AGAINST IN TERMS OF THE VOTE ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD HERE IN INVERNESS WHERE I HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VERY DANK MORNING I CAN'T SEE EM ON THE SHORES OF THE RIVER NESS I CAN'T SEE THE OTHER SIDE IS PRETTY MISTY BUT I'M WITH MUHAMMAD RAHMAN HERE I WAS A DRIVER IN THE CITY HE HAD A VERY FAST GROWING CITY OF INVERNESS YASMIN RALPH WHO'S A DRIVING INSTRUCTOR AND THE BOTH WITH ME HERE AND ONE IS STAY IN ONE IS LEAVE AND MOHAMMED EUROPE
LEAVE NO KWAI AND INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE YOU VOTED YES IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM YOU'RE A SUPPORTER OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONALIST WE'VE GOT FIFTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN THE SEAT WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE YOU
THIS IS A DOOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AS AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND AND IN THE HOLE SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT HOPPING IN AS WELL
AS THE POST OFFICE BEING ANY EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER WE PEER USER FEES INTO WITH HOLDING FIFTY BILLION INDRI JENNY GOT THE SPENDING FOR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLIONS WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE INCLUDING THE LOCAL S.N.P. M.P. WOULD SAY THAT INVERNESS IN THE HIGHLANDS HAVE GOT A LOT FROM EUROPE AND IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEAR
WELL WHILE IT'S TRUE ABOUT MEASUREMENTS HOW OUR LIFE IS AFFECTED FOR DAD FOR EXAMPLE
AS A MEMBER WHO DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE BORDERS SURE WE HELP I DON'T MAKE YOU WORRY I MEAN YOU'RE ORIGINALLY FROM BANGLADESH YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS SCOTTISH NOW DO YOU YOU THINK I'M SELF ISLAND PRETTY MUCH BRITISH SO YOU WANT MORE CONTROL OVER THE BORDER
I WANT MORE CONTROLS BECAUSE HE'S DOING IT IS AS WELL THAT'S RIGHT RETURNED HE HAS BEEN STANDING JUST BESIDE YOU KNOW I THINK ALSO ORIGINALLY FROM BANGLADESH IS THAT RIGHT YES WOULD YOU REGARD YOURSELF AS WHAT NOW ACTUALLY BRITISH BANGLADESHI
BOLT AND SCOTTISH ESCOTT THE SCOTTISH TOO YEAH DEFINITELY YOU EAT IT YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE TO REMAIN WHY THAT'S RIGHT
I'M IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN Y. YOU BECAUSE I'M A BUSINESS LADY MYSELF WE DID HIS CLUB AND RUNNING MY BUSINESS IS SEEN THEIR BUSINESS PROSPECT OFF IT
A STAYING WITH YOU HE'S GOT IT MAKE THE TRADING EASIER FOR US MOVING MONEY AND ALSO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER FOR US
WHAT'S YOUR FEELING ABOUT THE THE GENERAL VIEW OF THE PEOPLE YOU TALK TO HERE AND IN THE CITY OF INVERNESS
I THINK WE HAVE DIFFERING OPINIONS OBVIOUSLY SOME FAVOUR SUMMER LIKE YOU HE SAID HE'S NOT OBVIOUSLY I MEAN FABER WE COULD ACTUALLY ARGUED DEBATES LOT OF ISSUES HERE BUT END OF THE DAY I THINK WE HAVE TO SEE I SEE PERSONALLY MY VINNY FEED THEN THE WHOLE NATION'S BINNIE FEET YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT ALTHOUGH WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF HEAT AND NOISE ABOUT THE EUROPEAN QUESTION THE REAL
CAMPAIGN HASN'T BEGUN YET I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I THINK AGUNG MUHAMMAD RAHMAN HERE IF
IF YOU HEAR FROM THE S.N.P. OF WHOM YOU'RE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT THEY STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT SCOTLAND AS PART OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AS IT IS WOULD BE BETTER OFF
SYED WOULD YOU THINK HER CHANGING HER MIND OR ARE YOU SURE WHAT BEING A BEING A SCOT LEN WELL I BROUGHT YOU AS BEING A SCOTTISH IF SCOTLAND WAS INDEPENDENT BUT NOW I AM THINKING OF HOLLOWED RETAIN ALL RIGHT SO IF THE WHOLE REGION IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM SCOTLAND BRITAIN HAS BROUGHT
IN A MUCH MORE PART OF THE WORLD SO WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO THE CLOCK DON'T YOU MEAN AN INDEPENDENT BRITAIN AS YOU WOULD SEE IT OUTSIDE THE E.U. COULD COULD THRIVE WHEREAS IF THERE WAS AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND WHICH YOU VOTED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO US LESS THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO YOU WOULD WANT AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND TO BE INSIDE THE INSIDE THERE YES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
I THINK TO BE HONEST YEAH
INSIDE THE DAY IS GOING TO MAKE OUR EVERYTHING SLOT EASIER HE'S GOING TO BE A LOT STRONGER ECONOMY WISE AND MONEYWISE IT'S YOUR MIND'S MADE UP
WELL THE FIRST ABOUT LITTLE GROUPS OF VOTERS HERE IN OUR LATEST TOUR AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM INVERNESS THIS MORNING FOR MUHAMMAD RAHMAN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR COMING UP IN A VERY COLD DANK MORNING ALTHOUGH WE'RE BESIDE THE BEAUTIFUL WATERS OF THE RIVER NESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS WELL THANK YOU THANKS TO ALL WILL THEY HAVE AND JIM AND MORE GUESTS LATER ON IN THE PROGRAMME THE TIME NOW IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN MILD WINTER EQUALS HAPPINESS FOR GARDEN BIRDS THAT'S THE MAIN FINDING AT THE R.S.P.B. BIG GARDEN BIRD WATCH THE ANNUAL EVENT
TAKES PLACE IN JANUARY HALF A MILLION PEOPLE REPORT ON THE BIRDS THAT THEY SPOT CLOSE TO HOME MARTIN FOLEY FROM THE ARTS P.B. IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THE LONG TAILED TIT HAS COME IN AT NUMBER TEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IT HAS ITS FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS IT'S BEEN THERE AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE REALLY BENEFITED FROM THE MILD WINTER THAT WE HAD IN DECEMBER AND EARLY JANUARY IT DOESN'T DO WELL IN COLD WINTERS SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY SEEING THE BENEFIT IN GARDENS WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO ONE EXCLUSIVELY HERDERS
YEP DAPHNE SEEMS PLEASED TO BE IN AT NUMBER TEN AND THAT THIS IS WHAT IS THE THAT THE WIDER PICTURE I SUPPOSE IS THE OBVIOUS ONE REALLY ISN'T IT THAT WHEN IT'S MILD THESE THESE SMALL BUT I HAVE A GOOD TIME
THEY DO THEY DO THAT IT WAS HE SAID OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE TAKING PART AND THEY COUNTED OVER EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUAL BIRDS THROUGHOUT THE U.K. AND THAT GIVES US REALLY VALUABLE DATA THAT HELPS US TELL JUST HOW OUR GARDEN BIRDS ARE DOING AND OBVIOUSLY LONG TAILED TITS THIS YEAR HAVE DONE PARTICULARLY WELL BUT OTHER BIRDS LIKE THE FAMILIAR SONG THRUSH IS CONTINUING TO DECLINE
AND THAT'S ONE THAT WE'VE REALLY GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHY WOULD THAT BE A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS FROM LOSS OF BREEDING SITES LIKE HEDGEROWS AND ALSO A LACK OF FOOD SO INVERTEBRATE SLUGS SNAILS AND IT NEEDS TO EAT BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO HELP THESE BIRDS IF WE GO TO THE R.S.P.B. WEBSITE THERE'S A WHOLE LOAD OF DIFFERENT IDEAS TO HELP IMPROVE HER GARDENS FOR NATURE AND AN AMERICAN WARBLER
TURNING UP IN SOMEONE'S GARDEN AT IT FEELS AS IF THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING IS THAT THIS YEAR I WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT SOMEBODY REPORT THEM AND WE GET THIS SO YOU KNOW EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A VERY RARE OR UNUSUAL BIRD TURNS UP IN PEOPLE'S GARDENS AND I THINK THINGS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT WAS A TYPE OF AMERICAN WARBLER SHOWED UP THEY SENTENCED SOME PHOTOS OF THEIR GARDEN WITH THE BIRD IN THERE AND IT WAS A REAL REAL WRECK AT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I THINK THIS ONE WAS A SMALLISH YELLOW WITH A SLIGHTLY DARKER HEAD SO IT WAS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING BIRD AND
I MEAN IT'S DIFFERENT I KNOW ISN'T IT TRENDS IN THESE THINGS BY THEM AND THE FACT IS THAT IF OUR CLIMATE IS WARMING THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THIS YEAR IS GOING TO CARRY ON
CLIMATE MODELS PREDICT WARMER AND WETTER WINTERS SO FOR BIRDS LIKE LONG TAILED TITS LIKE GOLDCREST IS SMALL INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS THAT DON'T DO WELL IN COLD WINTERS THAN WE MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE INCREASES IN THEIR NUMBERS BUT SURVEYS LIKE THE BIG GARDEN BIRDWATCH AND OTHER SURVEYS THE R.S.P.B. AND OTHERS DO WILL REALLY KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER TIME AS THE CLIMATE CHANGES AND THE BIG GUN BURWASH IS A BIG DEAL HAS NEVER A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKING PART
YEAH I MEAN OVER HALF A MILLION AND IT'S A REALLY GREAT WAY FOR PEOPLE OF OUR FAMILIES TO SPEND AN HOUR WATCHING BIRDS AND JUST A SORT OF COMMUNE WITH NATURE IF YOU LIKE JUST THE SORT OF TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THEIR GARDEN AND HE WANTS TO DO IT NEXT YEAR WHAT DO THEY DO WELL WE'LL BE LAUNCHING THAT EARLY NEXT YEAR SO R.S.P.B. WEBSITE R.S.P.B. DOT ORG DOT U.K. KEEP AN EYE ON THAT AND ALL THE INFORMATION WILL BE THERE MARTIN FOLEY FROM THE ASK THANK YOU
THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND STAN IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER THANK YOU NICK GOOD MORNING TEA WE'VE GOT A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WHICH WILL INFLUENCE OUR WEATHER TODAY MEANING PLENTY OF FINE DRY AND SETTLED WEATHER WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE THERE'LL STILL BE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND WHICH WILL DEVELOP INTO THE AFTERNOON A FEW COULD TURN OUT TO BE QUITE HEAVY LAST NIGHT AND THE MANY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS TEMPERATURES REALLY PLUMMETED AND WE'VE SEEN A WIDESPREAD FROST TO START THIS MORNING
I'LL START WITH ENGLAND AND WALES WHERE AWAY FROM THE SOUTH EAST WHERE WE'VE GOT SOME HIGH CLOUD IT'S A COLD AND FROSTY START SOME MIST AND FOG PATCHES AROUND AND QUITE DENSE ACROSS NORTH WEST ENGLAND BUT FOR MOST A DRY AND BRIGHT IN A SUNNY MORNING THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ALSO SEE THAT'S HIGH CLOUD CONTINUED TO THIN TO ALLOW PLENTY SUNSHINE HERE AS WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON LIKE YESTERDAY'S SOME CLOUD WILL BUBBLE UP AND A FEW SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP
THEY'LL BE VERY WELL SCATTERED AND I THINK PERHAPS NORTHERN ENGLAND WILL SEE MOST OF THE SHOWERS THE ODD HEAVY ONE MOVING IN TOO MUCH OF WALES REMAIN DRY WITH GOOD SUNNY SPELLS ALL DAY AFTER THAT COLD START TEMPERATURES RISE NICELY IN THE LATE MARCH SUNSHINE TO REACH HIGHS OF TEN TO MAYBE FOURTEEN CELSIUS IN THE SOUTH FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND A COLD AND FROSTY START VERY FROSTY ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND A FEW MIST AND FOG PATCHES THE CENTRAL BELT OF SCOTLAND STARTING OFF RATHER CLOUDY A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS THESE WINTRY WITH SNOW OVER THE HILLS FOR A TIME
THROUGH THE DAY THEIR MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY WITH SUNNY SPELLS A FEW SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP THE ODD ONE ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AT THE FOCUS PERHAPS BEING IN SOUTHERN SCOTLAND WHERE THERE COULD BE THE ODD HEAVY ONE TOP TEMPERATURES AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN CELSIUS THAT'S MORRISSEY A CHANGE WET AND WINDY WEATHER WITH GALES WILL PUSH INTO NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT'S WET AND WINDY WEATHER PUSHING SOUTH AND EAST INTO NORTHWEST WALES AND NORTH WEST ENGLAND THROUGH THE DAY BUT ELSEWHERE IT SHOULD STAY DRY WITH SOME SUNSHINE THANK YOU STAB NEXT WEEK ON RADIO FOUR MATTHEW TAYLOR ARSE IS IT TIME TO AGREE TO DISAGREE
MALCOLM RIFKIND IS A FORMER DEFENCE SECRETARY AND WAS ONCE THIRD IN LINE TO PUSH THE NUCLEAR BUTTON IT WAS FROM YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR BUT IT WAS SO PRETTY SOBERING THOUGHT DOCTOR REBECCA JOHNSON IS A LIFELONG PEACE ACTIVIST I HEARD ABOUT A PEACE CAMP OUTSIDE THE FIRST DESIGNATED BASE FOR THE CRUISE MISSILES
AND I WENT DOWN TO STAY A WEEK AND ACTUALLY ENDED UP STAYING FIVE YEARS CAN THEY AGREE TO DIFFER OVER THE RENEWAL OF BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH A FRESH APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES JOIN ME MATTHEW TAYLOR FOR A GREETER
ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR STARTING NEXT WEDNESDAY EVENING AT EIGHT COMING UP IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME THE MAN WHO WANTS TRIED TO RESCUE THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY AND WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAVE BRITISH STEEL AND NEWLY RELEASED FILES REVEAL THE BATTLE FOR COMPENSATION THAN THOSE HELD BY THE NAZIS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B. B. C. RADIO FORWARD NICK ROBINSON AND JUSTIN
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING MINISTERS FROM ACROSS GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN SUMMONED TO AN EMERGENCY MEETING AT DOWNING STREET TO DISCUSS THE CRISIS AT TATA STEEL A REVIEW SAYS THERE ARE UNACCEPTABLE VARIATIONS IN THE QUALITY OF ENTER LIFE CARE IN END OF LIFE CARE IN ENGLAND EVEN THOUGH SOME IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE
AND THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER DONALD TRUMP HAS PERFORMED ARRAY YOU TURN AFTER BEING WIDELY CRITICISED FOR HER MARKS ON ABORTION TO P.B. CAESAR READ THIS MORNING BY DIANA SPEED DAVID CAMERON OR CHAIR AN EMERGENCY MEETING IN DOWNING STREET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S OPTIONS WERE SAVING BRITAIN'S BIGGEST STEEL MAKING COMPANY
HE'LL BE JOINED BY MINISTERS AND SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS WHITEHALL INCLUDING THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS AND THE WELSH OFFICE THE MEETING IS IN RESPONSE TO TATA STEEL'S DECISION TO SEEK BUYERS FOR ITS LOSS MAKING U.K. OPERATIONS UNIONS UNDEMANDING URGENT ACTION WHILE THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ROYAL NAVY LORD WEST HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. IT WOULD BE UNFORGIVABLE IF LARGE SCALE STILL PRODUCTION IN BRITAIN WAS TO END OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
TA TA STEEL EMPLOYS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U.K. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER JOBS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE INDUSTRY THE HUMAN COST OF IT COLLAPSING DOWN IS HUGE BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO GRAPPLE WITH A BIGGER STRATEGIC QUESTION IF WITH TAMING A STEEL INDUSTRY AND WITH IT THE CAPACITY TO SUPPLY U.K. MANUFACTURING IN DEFENCE IS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST
HOW CAN IT BE DONE THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SAGEDE JAVID SAID HE DIDN'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT BUYING THE PLANTS WAS THE SOLUTION STEPHEN KINNOCK THE LABOUR M.P. FOR PORT TALBOT THE SIGHT OF TATA'S BIGGEST U.K. PLANS HAS CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE WHAT HE CALLED AN INJECTION OF DIRECT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO TIDE THE BUSINESS OVER UNTIL A BUYER CAN BE FOUND
BUT ANY SUCH SUPPORT COULD PROVE EXPENSIVE AND WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH E.U. RULES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COUNTRIES DON'T SECURE AN ADVANTAGE BY PROPPING UP INDUSTRIES WITH TAXPAYERS' MONEY SO PLENTY FOR MINISTERS TO DISCUSS AND NO EASY SOLUTIONS
NUCLEAR WASTE IS TO BE SENT FROM SCOTLAND FOR PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE BIGGEST SHIPMENT OF ITS KIND UNDER THE DEAL BEING ANNOUNCED BY DAVID CAMERON LATER THE U.S. WILL TRANSPORT A DIFFERENT FORM OF ENRICHED URANIUM TO EUROPE WHERE IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED TO HELP DIAGNOSE AND TREAT CANCER
A REVIEW OF END OF LIFE CARE IN ENGLAND SUGGESTS MANY HOSPITALS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE ROUND THE CLOCK SPECIALISTS TO LOOK AFTER PATIENTS THE STUDY WAS LED BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS HE'D FOUND THAT IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BUT THERE WERE ALSO UNACCEPTABLE VARIATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN AREAS SUCH AS PROVIDING MEDICATION AND HELP WITH DRINKING HERE'S A HEALTH REPORT US MEET HIM AND
THE LIVERPOOL CARE PATHWAY WAS PHASED OUT TWO YEARS AGO AND HER CRITICISMS IT HAD TURNED INTO A TICK BOX EXERCISE LEAVING SOME PATIENTS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER
THIS REPORTS SUGGEST THINGS HAVE GOT STEADILY BETTER FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND THEIR RELATIVES BUT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SAYS JUST SIXTEEN OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO HOSPITAL TRUSTS HAVE PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALISTS AVAILABLE ON SITE AROUND THE CLOCK MANY HAD TELEPHONE ADVICE LINES OR SPECIALISTS AVAILABLE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF NINE AND FIVE THE RESEARCHER SAY THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH
THE REVIEW OF MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND PATIENT NOTES ALSO SUGGEST DECISIONS TO NOT RESUSCITATE WE'RE NOT ALWAYS DISCUSSED WITH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES OR FRIENDS N.H.S. ENGLAND WHICH COMMISSIONED THE REPORT WELCOME THE IMPROVEMENTS BUT SAID MORE COULD BE DONE
THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP HAS REVERSED HIS POSITION ON ABORTION WITHIN HOURS OF SEEING THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PUNISHED IF IT IS RE CRIMINALISED AFTER COMING UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES HE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE DOCTOR PERFORMING ABORTION SHOULD BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE NOT THE WOMAN FROM WASHINGTON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO
ONE OF THE KEY DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE ABILITY OF THE PROPERTY BILLIONAIRE TO MAKE PROVOCATIVE AND OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS AND REFUSED TO BUDGE FROM THEM EVEN WHEN THEY PROVOKED AN OUTCRY
BUT NOT LAST NIGHT HAVING DECLARED HIMSELF AS PRO LIFE HE WAS PRESTON AND INTERVIEW ON WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED IF THEY WENT AHEAD WITH AN ABORTION AFTER IT HAD BEEN OUTLAWED
IT HAS TO BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR THE ONE YEAH HAS TO BE SOME FORM TESS DOYLE THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WHY NOW I DON'T KNOW TAKE POSITIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE I FRANKLY I DO TAKE POSITIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED POSITION PRO CHOICE AND FEMINIST GROUPS CONDEMNED HIS REMARKS BUT MORE STRIKING WAS THE CRITICISM THAT CAME FROM CONSERVATIVE ANTI ABORTION GROUPS ALL REUNITED IN SAYING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD NEVER BE THE TARGET OF LEGAL ACTION IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
FINDING HIMSELF COMPLETELY ISOLATED MISTER TRUMP DID SOMETHING HE HASN'T DONE THAT TOO HE ISSUED A STATEMENT REVERSING HIS POSITION
THIS COMES AS A SUCCESSION OF POLES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT MISTER TRUMP HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH WOMEN WITH UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF THOSE QUESTIONED SAYING THEY HAVE AN UNFAVOURABLE VIEW OF HIM ANTI TRUMP REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING THIS INCIDENT MIGHT MARK A TURNING POINT IN HIS FORTUNES
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS MIGRANT WORKERS AND CONSTRUCTION SITES FOR THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARE FACING SYSTEMATIC ABUSE WHICH AMOUNTS TO FORCED LABOUR IN SOME CASES THE CAMPAIGN GROUP INTERVIEWED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE MOST OF THEM FROM NEPAL INDIA AND BANGLADESH THE QATARI GOVERNMENT AND FEVERS THEY TAKEN MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS A CORRESPONDENT MARK LAVELLE REPORTS
QATAR WAS SEVERELY CRITICISED LAST YEAR FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE CRACKED DOWN ON BAD PRACTICE HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE BUT WHEN AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SPOKE TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY WORLD CUP RELATED WORKERS THEY FOUND PROBLEMS THERE TOO
MANY SAID THEY WERE STILL FORCED TO WORK AGAINST THEIR WILL ALL HAD DEBTS FROM PAYING HER LEGAL RECRUITMENT FEES TO AGENTS AND ALL BUT SIX SAID THEIR SALARIES WERE LOWER THAN PROMISED AMNESTY FOUND INFORMALLY EMPLOYED WORKERS WERE MOST AT RISK AND SAYS IT'S CONCERNED THE EXTRA THIRTY TWO THOUSAND WORKERS EMPLOYED ON WOKE UP SIGHTS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WELL ENTER WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS AN ENVIRONMENT OF EXPLOITATION
ATARI GOVERNMENT SAID NEW LAWS WOULD PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EX PATRIOTS BUT FOOTBALL'S GOVERNING BODY FEVER SAID IT HAD ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS
THE UN TRIBUNAL FOR WAR CRIMES IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IS TO DELIVER ITS VERDICT IN THE CASE OF THE ULTRA NATIONALIST SERBIAN POLITICIAN VOICELESS THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM INCLUDE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND RELATE TO THE FORCED REMOVAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CREATIONS ARE MUSLIMS FROM THEIR HOMES BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS WELL AS MURDER AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
GENETIC TESTS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT ON TUMOURS FROM CHILDREN WITH CANCER RESEARCH AT THE ROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL IN LONDON IS AIMED AT FINDING NEW TARGET TREATMENTS AS A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER EXPLAINS CANCER IN CHILDREN IS FORTUNATELY RARE BUT THIS MEANS THERE ISN'T A LARGE POPULATION OF PATIENTS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS OF NEW DRUGS THE NEW TEST WILL ANALYSE TISSUE FROM FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN IN THE U.K. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS GIVING SCIENTISTS FROM THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENETIC CHANGES WHICH ARE DRIVING THE GROWTH OF EACH CANCER TUMOUR THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL ENABLE DOCTORS TO MAKE A STRONGER CASE FOR USING TARGETED DRUGS ON SOME YOUNG PATIENTS POSSIBLY SPARING THEM FROM THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OF BRUTAL TREATMENT BY THE NAZIS HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES THEY'RE CONTAINED IN APPLICATIONS FOR COMPENSATION SUBMITTED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES CLAIMS WERE MADE BY MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH JUST OVER A QUARTER OF THEM ARE SHOWING DAMAGES FROM A ONE MILLION POUND FUND AS NICK HOME REPORTS THEY INCLUDE SEVERAL CHANNEL ISLANDERS WHO WERE SENTENCED TO FORCED LABOUR IN GERMANY
HAROLD LE DREA NECK CAME FROM JERSEY IN JUNE NINETEEN FORTY FOUR HE WAS ARRESTED BY THE OCCUPYING GERMAN AUTHORITIES AND ENDED UP IN BERGEN BELSEN THE ONLY BRITISH SURVIVOR OF THE NOTORIOUS CAMP JUNGLE LAW REIGNED HE WROTE IN HIS APPLICATION FOR COMPENSATION AT NIGHT YOU KILLED OR WERE KILLED BY DAY CANNIBALISM WAS RAMPANT HE WAS EVENTUALLY AWARDED ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE EARNS AROUND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS IN TODAY'S MONEY
FRANK TUCK WAS ONE OF SEVENTEEN GUERNSEY POLICEMAN ARRESTED FOR STEALING FROM GERMAN STORES AND FORCED TO WORK ON THE GERMAN RAILWAYS ONE DIED FROM THE BEATINGS HE RECEIVED ANOTHER ACCORDING TO TAX ACCOUNT WAS CHANGED TO A TREE FOR SIX HOURS IN THE SNOW MADE TO LIFT HEAVY SLEEPERS AND BAGS OF CEMENT AND GIVEN COLD SHOWERS IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES TUCKS OWN HEALTH WAS PERMANENTLY DAMAGED IF HE GOT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY
NICK HYAM REPORTING IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN SHAMBLES DISARRAY CHAOTIC JUST A FEW OF THE WORDS USED IN TODAY'S HEADLINES TO DESCRIBE THE GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF THE CRISIS FACING THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SHH AGIT CENTRED JAVID MAYBE RELIEVED THAT HE'S ON A PLANE BACK FROM AUSTRALIA WHERE HE WAS ON A TRADE MISSION AND WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THEM THE PRIME MINISTER THOUGH FLOWN HOME FROM HIS HOLIDAY TO CHAIR A CRISIS SUMMIT
MAY NOT QUITE SHARE THAT EMOTION SO WAS A MINISTER'S PREPARED TO DO TO SAVE PORT TALBOT WHAT COULD THEY DO WHAT SHOULD THEY DO YESTERDAY THE BUSINESS SECRETARY ANNECY WE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME NOTHING WAS OFF LIMITS
ONE POSSIBILITY IS TEMPORARILY NOT MOSTLY NATIONALISATION BUT TEMPORALLY THE U.K. OR INDEED THE WELSH GOVERNMENT COULD SAY WELL WE'LL HOLD ONTO IT UNTIL WE CAN FIND A BUYER AT THAT IS THAT IS THAT IS AN OPTION AND OF COURSE I MADE CLEAR YESTERDAY WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL OPTIONS
YET HOURS LATER HER BOSS STILL DOWN UNDER SEEM TO SAY THE OPPOSITE I DON'T THINK THAT NATIONALISATION IS GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE WOULD WANT A LONG TERM VIABLE SOLUTION AND IF YOU LOOK AROUND EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE I THINK THE NATIONALISATION IS VERY EARLY
THE SEARCH IS NOW ON FOR A BUYER FOR THE STEEL WORKS NOT JUST IMP AT ALL BUT BUT TO TAKE OVER OPERATIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF SOUTH WALES IN HARTLEPOOL AND CORBY SIR WHO MIGHT BITE THEM AND WHY A MAN WHO MIGHT KNOW IS THE VENTURE CAPITALIST JON MOULTON MAY RECALL SOME YEARS AGO HE TRIED TO LEAD A RESCUE OF M.G. LANDROVER
WHEN IT WAS PUT UP FOR SALE BY B.M.W. GOOD MORNING TO YOU MY MOLTEN GOOD MORNING WOULD YOU ARE YOU REMOTELY TEMPTED BY THE PROSPECT OF BUYING A BUSINESS WHICH ACCORDING TO ITS OWN DIRECTOR HAS VALUES WORTH QUOTES ALMOST NOTHING ER NO I DON'T FEEL ANY GREAT URGE TO END OF ESTIMATE I'M AFRAID THE COMPANY USUALLY USING SOMETHING LIKE A MILLION A DAY ITS RESULTS ARE BASICALLY IT'S WAGE BILL IS BEING LOST
DOESN'T EVEN CONTRIBUTE TO THE WAGES AT THE MOMENT ONLY MACRO POSITION IS HORRIBLE IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMPANY AND THE CHINESE HAVE GROWN THEIR INDUSTRY ENORMOUSLY THEY FLOODED THE WORLD MARKET A STIRLING'S BEEN STRONG HOW THEY'VE GOTTEN HIGHER ENERGY COS THEIR MONEY OR THEIR COMPETITORS
I'M AFRAID IT IS PROBABLY MISSION IMPOSSIBLE AND A VERY VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD NEED TO GO AND TO COME UP WITH ANY CHALLENGE HER WAY FORWARD AND YOU'RE NOT TO BE TOO GLOOMY THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME COMPANIES ACCOMPANY COMPANY LIBERTY FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS LOOKING AT BUYING PARTS OF THIS BUSINESS IT BOUGHT A STEEL MILL IN NEWPORT AT THE REAL PART OF THE BUSINESS WHICH RETRACTABLE UNFORTUNATE THERE A SMALL PART OF THE PERSON
BASICALLY COMMODITY STEALS HER ARE JUST VERY HEAVILY LAST MAKING AND ARE LIKELY TO BE SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION THERE ISN'T IT THE FIRST HAVE FUTURE IN OTHER WORDS A LEVEL OF THE PELMET CHANGE THERE MAYBE HIGHER TARIFFS AGAINST CHINESE EXPORTS IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT IF YOU COULD JUST BUNNY SOME TIME
YOU WOULD GIVE THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUED LIFE NOT JUST FOR THIS COMPANY BUT THE JOBS TO GO WITH IT IF YOU WOULD NEED TO DO A LOT I WAS AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NUMBERS IS A VERY LARGE INDEED AND
REALLY YOU'D HAVE TO SAY ECONOMICALLY HARD HEARTEDLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE UM IS IT WORTH DOING
WELL SOME WOULD SAY IT'S WORTH DOING FOR TWO REASONS ONE FOR GOODNESS SAKE WE DID IT FOR THE BANKS SO WHY ON EARTH CAN'T WE DO IT FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY WILL HEAR FROM LEN MCCLUSKEY AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING MAKING THAT ARGUMENT I SUSPECT SUSPECT AND THERE'S ANOTHER ARGUMENT ISN'T THERE THIS IS A STRATEGIC INDUSTRY THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DEFENCE INTEREST LIKE BRITAIN NEED A STEEL INDUSTRY SO SAYS ADMIRAL WEST
RIGHT THEY STICK STRATEGIC ARGUMENT IS I THINK REALLY VERY WEAK
EVEN BEFORE WORLD WAR TWO THE U.K. WAS BUYING ARBOUR PLATE FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA FOR EACH ROYAL NAVAL SHIPS THERE ARE SIXTY ODD COUNTRIES THAT PRODUCE STEEL THERE'S NO LIKELIHOOD OF HAS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET STEEL
SO I DON'T SEE THAT IT'S A STRATEGIC ARGUMENT ARGUMENT AT ALL SO THERE'S NO REAL BASIS FOR MAN TANIA
SO IF YOU WERE IN GOVERNMENT IF PRIME HE INVITED YOU IN AND SAID WHAT WILL YOU DO SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF MEETINGS AND EXPRESSING SYMPATHY BUT DON'T DO THAT MUCH I THINK THEY'RE I DON'T SAY IS TO DEAL WITH THE HUMAN PROBLEM
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE WHO WORKED IN AN INDUSTRY SOMETIMES FOR GENERATIONS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON THE INDUSTRY THERE ARE TOWNS THAT ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON THE MYSTERY THE THING IS TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN IN NEW JOBS THE GOVERNMENT PROBABLY NEEDS TO CHUCK SOME NUMBER OF THE ORDER OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION I HAD BASICALLY SUPPORT TO GET PEOPLE INTO A NEW JOB
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING IT CAN DO AND YET WHEN WE LOOK BACK IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I THINK THAT YOU WERE SIXTEEN YOU WERE TRYING TO BUY EM GEE LAND ROVER AT THE TIME PEOPLE SAID THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY IS IN A MESS LOOK AT IT NOW IT IS D. GREAT TRIUMPHANT SUCCESS IN FRANCE I WAS TRYING TO BUY A G. NOT LANDROVER LANDROVER WAS OBVIOUSLY A SUCCESS AND HAS KEPT THE OTHER PIECE OF TART O.K. REALLY VERY WELL
THE M.G. CAR COMPANY HAS PERFORMED VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH MY EXPECTATIONS THE U.K. PRESENCE IS TRIVIAL COME ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LEGAL HIGHS ARE NOT BEING BANNED FROM NEXT WEEK AS HAD BEEN PLANNED AS A DELAY OF AT LEAST A MONTH'S WHAT'S GOING ON IS THE VAN COLLAPSING THE PLAN HAD BEEN FOR ANY SUBSTANCE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A PSYCHOACTIVE EFFECT THAT IS AFFECTING THE BRAIN AND SOME SORT OF A WAY TO BE BANNED FROM APRIL THE SEX BUT WHAT'S THAT MEAN EXACTLY
SEEMS THAT THE PLACE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT THERE IS OF COURSE NO DOUBT THAT LEGAL HIGHS CAN DAMAGE PEOPLE WE SPOKE TO SOMEONE LAST YEAR ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF HIS ADDICTION TO SYNTHETIC CANNABIS
TOOK A BOOT ALL ARMY THEY KISS TALKS I CAN'T SLEEP ON US COUNTY ON US YOU'RE ANGRY ALL THE TIME
HE WAS HAVE TRAPPED IN FOOTBALL IN THE HOUSE ON THE SPORT
ON THE ABILITIES DO PISS POO SNOOKER
RON AND JOB FRONT DO NOT CUTTING ANY MORE
SLEEP NO JUST GOAD THE CONDEMNED
HE'S HEAD OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TRANSFORM WHICH IS A CHARITABLE THING TAKE HER CAMPAIGNS FOR THEIR LEGAL REGULATION OF DRUGS IN THE U.K. INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK'S HAPPENING
WELL THE FIRST THING WE'VE GOT TO DO IS RECOGNISE THAT ALL DRUGS INCLUDING THOSE SOLD IN IN HEAD SHOPS IN HIGH STREET SELLERS ARE A DANGEROUS AND WHAT'S GONE ON HERE IS AN ATTEMPT OF A FOOLISH DANGEROUS
MISGUIDED ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO RID THE U.K. OF LEGAL HIGHS BY CLOSING HEAD SHOPS BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WHAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO WAS CREATE LEGISLATION
THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT DRUGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED YET AND THAT MAKES THE DRAFTING OF THE LEGISLATION VERY COMPLEX AND
THEY FAILED THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE FAILED FIND LEMON IS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS OBVIOUSLY YOUR EAR IS CLOSE TO THE GROUND ON THESE THINGS IN THEIR PLACE OR SOME OTHER PARP PERHAPS PART OF THE HOME OFFICE AND SAID LOOK AT THE MOMENT JUST ISN'T GONNA WORK WELL IT IT ISN'T IT THE THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN DRAFTED HAS HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RIDICULE
FOR MANY MONTHS NOW IN ADVANCE FOR IT AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE DEBATES I HEARD LORD BITES IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS EXPLAINING TO THE TO THE HOUSE HOW ALCOHOL WAS NOT A PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE
SO IT'S BEEN EVER SO DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DO THIS IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN IMPOSSIBLE BUT ALSO FOOLISH AND MISGUIDED INSOFAR AS WE KNOW THAT PROHIBITION DOESN'T WORK AND THE OTHER THING WE'VE GOT TO DO IS JUST OUTSIDE JUST ON THERE SORRY INTO EVERY JUDGE SURE MAGS WE HAVE LIMITED TIME REALLY DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY BROUGHT THE LEGISLATION IS THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY IN PLACES WHERE THERE ARE HEAD SHOPS PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT WHAT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE THE NORMALISING
OF DOING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO YOURSELF AND THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE ADDRESSING THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM ISN'T IT IT IS A REAL PROBLEM THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW YOU WERE DRESSED AT THE FIRST THING IS THAT LEGAL HIGHS HAVE ARISEN BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE PROHIBITION OF TRADITIONAL DRUGS LIKE CANNABIS COCAINE HEROIN AND ECSTASY THEY'VE EMERGED BECAUSE THE GAP IN THE MARKET CREATED BY THAT PROHIBITION IS HUGE AND LEGAL HIGHS HAVE FILLED THAT SO IN FACT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY THE MISUSE OF DRUGS ACT NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
AND THAT HASN'T THAT HASN'T BEEN RECOGNISED THE NEXT THING IS THAT THEY THEN USE PROHIBITION TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM CREATED BY PROHIBITION AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PLACES WHERE THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN APPLIED IN POLAND AND IN IRELAND THE HARMS OF ACTUALLY INCREASED THE USE OF LEGAL HIGHS IN IRELAND IS NOW HIGHER THAN IT WAS
BEFORE THE LEGISLATION WAS BROUGHT IN TO CLOSE THE HEAD CHOPS AND THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH DAVID CAMERON JEREMY CORBIN NICOLA STURGEON AND ALL THE OTHER LEADERS IN PARLIAMENT MUST SIT DOWN TAKE A STEP BACK AND REVIEW THE WAY THAT PROHIBITION IS ACTUALLY CREATING SIGNIFICANT HARM
AND LOOK TOWARDS REGULATING AND CONTROLLING USING GOVERNMENT CONTROL REGULATION LEGAL CONTROLS TO COLLAPSE THE LEGAL HIGHS MARKET BY REGULATING AND CONTROLLING TRADITIONAL DRUGS DANNY FIRST THANK YOU
HE'S COMING UP TO NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN NOW ONE OF THE FACTORS MAKING LIFE DIFFICULT FOR THE U.K. STEEL INDUSTRY AS YOU'LL KNOW IS THIS COMPARATIVELY HIGH ENERGY COSTS IN THIS COUNTRY CAN ANYTHING BE DONE TO GET THE PRICE DOWN JOAN LINE UM IS HERE TO TELL US YES THANKS NICK IT AS PART OF BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO SLASH CARBON EMISSIONS MOST OF OUR COAL FIRED POWER STATIONS HAD TO CLOSE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE
VERY BRIDGE IN WEST YORKSHIRE IS SHUTTING DOWN TODAY AND WHAT IS THERE TO REPLACE THEM AND WHAT ABOUT NUCLEAR HICKLEY POINT IS NOW A BYWORD FOR DELAY POLYMER SARA WAS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ENERGY COMPANY EM POWER UNTIL LAST YEAR IS NOW THE PRESIDENT OF GENESIS CAPITAL CORPORATION GOOD MORNING PAUL
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PLANS TO CUT DOWN TO SHUT DOWN THESE HIGH CARBON EMITTING POWER STATIONS BUT A LOW COST POWER STATIONS
STEER PRODUCERS BLAME HIGH ENERGY COSTS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THEIR PROBLEMS MAJOR PROBLEMS THEY ALSO BLAMED THE RENEWABLES DRIVE DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM
BUT I WOULD
WE ARE GOING TO TAP INTO THAT WHEN WE HAVE MORE INTER CONNECTION ON ELECTRICITY WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD MOVE FOR HELP KEEP PRICES LOW AND GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING TO HELP LARGE ENERGY BUT CLEARLY WHERE YOU'VE GOT AN INDUSTRY SUCH AS STEEL
I HAVE THE THE LICHEN ASKING ABOUT THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED JOBS ARE GOING AT YOUR FORMER EMPLOYER EM POWER LIKE THAT TO HAD TO DO WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE DID YOU DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE IN CHARGE SO I THINK I THINK WE WERE TRANSITIONING ESSENTIALLY IMPROVING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IT
THEIR FORMER BOSS OF N. POWER NOW WITH GENESIS CAPITAL CORPORATION
THERE ARE TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IN THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES A FUND WAS SET UP TO COMPENSATE PEOPLE IN THE U.K. HAD BEEN THE VICTIMS OF NAZI PERSECUTION HUNDREDS OF FILES OF THE CLAIMS EMMA OBJECTIONS AS WELL OF APPLICATIONS FOR MONEY FROM THAT FUND HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AT KEW DOCTOR GEORGE KATE HEY I'M SORRY RECORD SPECIALIST AT THE LACK OF NATIONAL OFFERS TO HEAD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THEY ARE JUST EXTRAORDINARY FOR TWO REASONS REALLY I SUPPOSE NUMBER ONE
THAT THE TONE OF SOME OF THE LETTERS BUT NUMBER TWO THAT THE STORIES THAT THEY TELL ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE A REALLY VAST RANGE
DIFFERENT APPLICANTS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS TELLING VERY DIFFERENT STORIES BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR RELEASE
IS THAT THE POLICY FILES RELATING TO THIS THIS ANGLO GERMAN AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME BUT WHAT YOU HAVE HERE ARE THE WORKINGS OF THAT IT YOU'VE GOT THE REAL STORIES INCLUDING HIS ACT AT SOMEONE WHO WAS IN BELSEN
QUITE YES AND SAYS OF IT IT WAS DEAD AND
A MOST UNPLEASANT PLACE I MEAN IT'S THAT STIFF UPPER LIP THAT REALLY STRIKES YOU WHEN YOU READ SOME OF THEM BUT THE APPLICATION YEAH THAT'S TRUE PEOPLE ALL OF THEM HAVE OBVIOUSLY SUFFERED IN THAT'S THAT'S WHY THEY THEY WROTE TO THE COMMISSION TO SEEK COMPENSATION
THE DEGREE TO WHICH EACH OF THEM SUFFER IS SOMEWHAT INVOLVED IN THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE COMPENSATED WELL THE MAN IN BELSEN HAD BEEN IN BELSEN REFERRED TO MEANS OF PUTTING INMATES TO DEATH BEATING DROWNING CRUCIFIXION HANGING IN VARIOUS STANCES JUNGLE OR RAINED AMONG THE PRISONERS AT NIGHT YOU KILL
OR WERE KILLED THERE WAS CANNIBALISM THAT WAS RAMPANT TO WHAT DID HE GET IN THE END YOU KNOW
I HAVE THAT PARTICULAR CASE I'M NOT SURE WHAT HIS HIS ACTUAL FINAL SETTLEMENT WAS BUT IT WAS IN THE LOW THOUSANDS WASN'T IT IT WAS I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PHONE THAT AMOUNTS TO ONE MILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL FOR THIS IS BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE I THINK IF YOU MAKE THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THAT A MODERN FIGURE IT EQUATE TO SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTEEN MILLION AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO PROVE TO GET MONEY AT ALL
WELL MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE AND THIS IS THE CRITICAL POINT I THINK REALLY WHICH CENTRES ON ELIGIBILITY IS THE FAT
TIME IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP OR A CAMP WHERE CONDITIONS WERE COMPARABLE TO A CONCENTRATION CAMP SO THE MAXIMUM OUT OF ME YOU COULD GET FROM
THE COMMISSION WAS FOUR THOUSAND AGAIN IF YOU WERE TO CONVERT THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT SIXTY NINE BUT THEY TAKE A VERY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY
GIVE OUT THAT MONEY IT'S A UNIT CALCULATION THING I WAS CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP EQUATES TO A CERTAIN SAYS NOT A DEGREE OF SUFFERING IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME YOU SPENT THERE TO SOME DEGREE PARTS THERE ARE TWO PARTS THAT ONE OF THEM IS EFFECTIVELY HOW MUCH TIME HE SPENT THERE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUIBBLING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED IF YOU HAVE SPENT TIME IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IS PHYSICAL DISABILITY SO YOUR C. IF YOU FLICK THROUGH THE FILES THERE'S THE DETAILS OF MEDICAL REPORTS SO THEY PRODUCE THOSE TO EFFECTIVELY SAY
IF SOMEBODY HAS BEEN DEBILITATED BY THE TIME SPENT IT DURING PERSECUTION WHATEVER THAT MIGHT
INVOLVE THAT EQUATES TO A NUMBER OF UNITS WHICH EQUATES TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY QUITE A BRUTAL PROCESS ACTUALLY AS ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED HORRIBLY YEAH THAT'S THAT'S TRUE AND I THINK IT IS RECOGNISED AND IF YOU READ THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND THE INDIVIDUALS I DO NONE OF THEM ARE BELITTLE THEY'RE NOT SAYING I'M AFRAID YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED ENOUGH TO RECEIVE ANY MONEY IN
THE ADVERTISED THAT THEY PUSH OUT TO TRY AND ATTRACT PEOPLE TO APPLY TO THE SCHEME THEY VERY DELIBERATELY SAY
THESE CONDITIONS SO IT IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SPENT ON THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS OR INCOME SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO SEE THIS FOR THEMSELVES THESE ARE CAUSE HERSELF CAMERA ABSOLUTELY YEAH WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO COME AND EXPLORE THEM COS WE'VE ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE IF SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE THE NATIONAL PARK TO THE FRONT TODAY JUST MAKE SURE YOU BRING TWO FORMS OF I.D. WITH YOU DOCTOR CHOICE HEY THANK YOU HECTOR I'M T. SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN GARY'S HERE WITH US

DAVID CAMERON WILL TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON LATER WHERE HE WILL ANNOUNCE A NUCLEAR DEAL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE UNDER THE PLAN BRITAIN WILL SEND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED KILOS OF NUCLEAR WASTE TO BE PROCESSED IN THE U.S. IN RETURN AMERICA WILL TRANSPORT ENRICHED URANIUM TO EUROPE WERE TO BE CONVERTED INTO ISOTOPES USED TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT CANCER
A STUDY HAS FOUND THAT HOSPITALS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE FACE TO FACE PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALISTS AROUND THE CLOCK THE REVIEW OF END OF LIFE TREATMENT LED BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ACKNOWLEDGES STEADY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT ONCE THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO
HAMAS NEW GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSED THAT DUNG SONS TO ACHIEVE BE GIVEN A NEW ROLE SIMILAR TO THAT OF PRIME MINISTER AND NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY WHICH WON A LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER WANTS TO CREATE A NEW POST OF ADVISER TO THE STATE AND THE SUN'S HOOCHY IS CONSTITUTIONALLY BARRED FROM THE PRESIDENCY
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS MIGRANT WORKERS BUILDING VENUES FOR THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARE FACING SYSTEMATIC ABUSE WHICH IN SOME CASES OFTEN AMOUNTS TO FORCED LABOUR OR REPORT SAID MOST OF THEM LIVED IN SQUALID CONDITIONS GOT PAID LESS THAN PROMISED AND COULDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE THEIR PASSPORTS HAVE BEEN SEIZED THE QATARI GOVERNMENT AND FEE FIRST SO THEY HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS
ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE WAR IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WERE FOUND OUT THIS MORNING WHETHER HE'S BEEN CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES BY U.N. CAUGHT THE ULTRA NATIONALIST SERVING POLITICIAN VOICELESS SHE WON'T BE IN THE HAGUE FOR THE HEARING BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO BELGRADE THE TREATMENT OF THE CANCER
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT AT THE VERY LEAST IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO ASK THAT IN A WEALTHY CIVILISED COUNTRY PEOPLE DYING IN HOSPITAL HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO DRINK AND YET IN MANY CASES THEY DO NOT AND IN A MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND THERE'S NO PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALIST ON HAND TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY IN SOME HOSPITALS THERE ISN'T ONE AT ALL ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS HAS LED A STUDY WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SHOWN REAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CARE OF THE DYING BUT STILL
NOT ENOUGH AND STILL THEY SUGGEST A TENDENCY TO SHY AWAY FROM PEOPLE IN THESE MOMENTS OF NEED AMANDA CHEESE HIS SHIP IS HERE SHE SPEAKS FOR THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF NURSING ON END OF LIFE CARE AND HAS HERSELF BEEN A NURSE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS
AND THE PROFESSOR SAM AND SIZE ALSO HERE WAS IF IT TOOK PART IN THIS ON BEHALF IN THIS REPORT FOR THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND WAS A CRITIC OF THE WAY WE USED TO DO THESE THINGS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH BUT I WANT TO START WITH YOU AMANDA TUESDAY HUH HOW SHOULD IT LOOK I MEAN WHAT IS THAT THE GOLD STANDARD DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF
END OF LIFE CARE WHAT SHOULD HOSPITALS BE PROVIDING AND DOING
THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDING PEOPLE WERE DYING IN THEIR FAMILY IS WITH THE INSURANCE IN THE CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CARING FOR THEM A WELL TRAINED ARE CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING I'M COMPETENT IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND A KIND NICE PEOPLE BECAUSE ACTUALLY AN AWFUL LOT OF THIS IS NOT ABOUT HIGHLY SKILLED HIGHLY TECHNICAL SKILLS IT'S ABOUT
PEOPLE KEEPING AN EYE ON SOMEBODY CHECKING ON THEM FINDING OUT WHAT THEY WANT AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY GET IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE SHOULD BE THOUGH A PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALIST UP SUMMER AND ALL THE TIME ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD A GOOD GENERAL TRAINING DOES NOT GIVE YOU THIS EDITION ADDITIONAL SKILLS THAT YOU NEED
IF SOMEBODY HAS COMPLEX ME OR THE MEDICATION OR THE TREATMENT THAT HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED IS NO LONGER WORKING
AND YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT YOU POSSIBLY CAN DO IN YOUR PARTICULAR SPHERE OF UNDERSTANDING AND SKILL AND THEREFORE YOU MUST HAVE THAT ACCESS TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS THAT ADDITIONAL COMPETENT IN THAT CASE PROFESSOR WHY THEY'RE NOT THERE AND SOME HOSPITALS NOT THERE AT ALL EVEN DURING THE DAY THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PALLIATIVE CARE PROVISION ANY SPECIALIST DOCTORS DOING
YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING JUSTIN WE FOUND OVERALL OUT OF ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO HOSPITAL TRUST THEY WERE TWENTY SIX THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY FACE TO FACE MEDICAL PRESENTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS DO PROVIDE TELEPHONE SERVICE AROUND THE CLOCK SO PEOPLE ON THE WARDS CAN GET HOLD OF ADVICE ON THE TELEPHONE
WHAT TERM DID CONCERN US WAS THAT ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF HOSPITALS HAD FACE TO FACE VISITING BY A SPECIALIST IS MANDA DESCRIBES JUST BETWEEN THE HOURS OF NINE TO FIVE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THAT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT CULTURE TO JUST AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED AND IT'S ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE I WAS
PART OF AN ON CALL ROTATION FOR TWENTY YEARS IN IN MY HOSPITAL IT COSTS MONEY TO HAVE A SERIES OF FIVE SIX JUNIOR DOCTORS FIRE SIX CONSULTANTS ON CALL FOR A POPULATION OF SAY HALF A MILLION TO COP PUT THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GO FROM THE PRESENT POSITION WE ARE NOW TO HAVING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY
CLEARLY IT DOES RE REQUIRE A LOT OF NEW INVESTMENT OR REINVESTMENT BUT YOU DON'T NEED EXTRA MONEY AND YOU DON'T NEED SPECIALIST PROVIDE DRINKS WATER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THIRSTY AND OF THEIR LIVES TO YOUR EARTH IS GOING WRONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS SUDDENLY COME OUT OF THE BLUE THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME HASN'T IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE LIVERPOOL CARE PATHWAY WHICH WAS SO CRITICISED AND HAS GONE YEAH WHY STILL
I THINK I THINK IT'S IT THERE IS STILL A FEAR OF DOING THE WRONG THING I KNOW THAT SOUNDS COMPLETELY COUNTER PUT IT COUNTERINTUITIVE WHEN SOMEBODY WAS EXPRESSING POTENTIALLY TH BEING THIRSTY BUT PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED THAT IF THEY GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO DRINK THEY'RE GOING TO CHOKE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING QUITE OFTEN DO CHOKE AND ALSO PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING
OR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING TOWARDS THE END SHE REALLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DRINK SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND FAMILIES GET VERY DISTRESSED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO DRINK IF I CAN GIVE A PERSONAL EXAMPLE I CARED FOR MY SISTER WHEN SHE WAS DYING WITH HER FAMILY AND HER FAMILY WERE ABSOLUTELY DISTRAUGHT WHEN SHE NO LONGER WANTED ANYTHING TO DRINK AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS
THEY END OF DYING PHASE SOMETIMES AND WE SHOULD OF COURSE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WON'T DRINK HAVE SOMETHING OR THAT THEIR MOUTH IS KEPT MOIST OR THAT THEY AT LEAST COMFORTABLE OF COURSE WE SHOULD AND IT'S NO EXCUSE NOT TO BUT THEN WE COME BACK DOWN THE PROFESSOR TO THIS BUSINESS OF OF OF
TAKING HOLD OF PEOPLE ALMOST PHYSICALLY HOLDING THEM BEING WILLING TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FAMILIES EVERYONE TOGETHER AT THE AT THESE EMOTIONAL TIMES IN A SUGGESTION IN THIS REPORT THAT ACTUALLY THAT STILL ISN'T THERE PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO WALK BY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAR
IT DOESN'T COME NATURALLY TO EVERYBODY YOU CAN TRAIN AS AMANDA SAYS YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL SKILLS OF THE BED THE BEDSIDE WHAT TO PRESCRIBE AND HOW TO EXAMINE AND ASSESS PEOPLE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SITTING DOWN ACTUALLY PUTTING A HAND ON SOMEBODY AND TALKING YOU KNOW FACE TO FACE SOUL TO SOUL THAT THAT REQUIRES A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON AND
WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO BE AVAILABLE AROUND THE CLOCK IT THERE ARE SPECIALISTS IN PALLIATIVE CARE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY THEY NEED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PAY FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE IN THAT IF IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION ALSO FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL MANY OF THE PATIENTS ARE ALREADY TOO ILL FOR COMMUNICATION BUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NEEDING DAD AND I DIDN'T MIND BEING CALLED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO COME AND MEET A FAMILY THAT WAS VERY DISTRESSED
I A PROFESSOR AMANDA CHEESY AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH PLEASURE TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MORNING PAPERS THE SUN CALLS THE DECISION BY TATA STEEL TO SELL ITS U.K. BUSINESS A TART OR A TAD TASTROPHE FORGIVE ME
THE PAPER BLAMES THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THE E.U. HAS BEEN SLUGGISH IN ITS RESPONSE TO THE OFFLOADING OF CHEAP CHINESE STEEL ON THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND IS PARTLY TO BLAME FOR WHAT IT CALLS CRIPPLING ENERGY COSTS AN UNNAMED SOURCE TELLS THE GUARDIAN THAT THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO BACK CALLS IN EUROPE FOR HIGHER TARIFFS AGAINST IMPORTS WAS THE LAST STRAW PROMPTING TARTARS DECISION TO SELL SANJIV GUPTA WHOSE COMPANY LAST YEAR REOPEN A STEEL MILL IN NEWPORT
TELLS THE MALE THAT BRUSSELS IS PREVENTING THE GOVERNMENT DOING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE STEEL INDUSTRY AND LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD BE GOOD FOR IT BUT HE ADMITS HE'S TORN AS PERSONALLY HE THINKS THE WORLD NEEDS TO INTEGRATE MORE FINANCIAL TIMES SINCE THE IDEA THAT LEAVING THE E.U. IT FRAE THE GOVERNMENT'S HAND IS ILLUSORY ITS LEADER COLUMN THE PAPER ARGUES IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THEY YOU WOULD SIGN ANY POST BREAKS IT TRADE DEAL WITHOUT REQUIRING BRITAIN TO ADHERE TO EXISTING USE STATE AID RULES
THE STEEL INDUSTRY ALSO FACES HOME GROWN HANDICAPS CORNY THE TELEGRAPH INCLUDING HIGH ENERGY COSTS GREEN TAXES EXCESSIVE BUSINESS RATES AND OVER REGULATION THE TIME SAYS EUROPE COULD NOW OFFER HELP BY CRACKING DOWN ON CHINESE DUMPING OF CHEAP STEEL AND ALSO BY ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO DRAW ON EUROPEAN GLOBALISATION ADJUSTMENT FUND

PETER EGON ANDRA JARVIE HERE INVERNESS WILL BE BACK IN AN HOUR WITH ANOTHER COUPLE OF VOTERS ELSEWHERE DOWN THE RIVER NESS WHERE THE SUN IS BEGINNING TO SHINE AND THANK YOU BOTH THANKS JIM TALK TO THEN THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND JOEL EDWARDS WHO AS ADVISER TO CHRISTIAN SOLIDARITY WORLDWIDE MONCHO GOOD MORNING
YESTERDAY THE HOWARD LEAGUE FOR PENAL REFORM PUBLISHED ITS CONCERNS THAT CHILDREN IN CARE HOMES LEGALLY DEFINE AS WE LOOKED AFTER OUR BEING DIS APPROPRIATE DISPROPORTIONATELY CRIMINALISE AND ENGLAND AND WALES BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN POLICE ACROSS SIXTEEN FORCES WERE CALLED TO OVER TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL HOMES
IN TWELVE OF THE SIXTEEN FORCES THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS BUT AS EVER THE STORY BEHIND THE HEADLINES UNVEILS CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN
THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING CALLED OUT TO WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS MINOR INCIDENTS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE DEALT WITH IN A FAMILY ENVIRONMENT BUT LOOK AFTER CHILDREN SIMPLY CANNOT BE COMPARED TO IDEALISE FAMILY SETTINGS WITH TWO POINT FIVE KIDS THE DOG CAT AND HOLIDAYS IN DISNEYLAND
THE HOWARD LEAGUE TALK OFF WONDERFUL YOUNG PEOPLE NEGLECTED BY HIGHLY PAID CARERS WHO INTERN CLAIM TO BE AMONGST THE MOST SCRUTINISED AND ACCOUNTABLE OF PUBLIC SERVICES YESTERDAY'S CONFLICTING RESPONSES FROM THE AGENCY'S CONCERN LEFT ME WITH A SENSE OF ANGUISH ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S FUTURES
A CLOSE FRIEND RUNNING A SMALL CHARITY HOUSING AND EDUCATING SOME OF OUR MOST RESTLESS AND VOLATILE CHILDREN TOLD ME OF THE TURMOIL INVOLVED IN CARING FOR DEEPLY DISTURBED CHILDREN WITH A TRAUMATISED PAST AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE
CAUGHT BETWEEN AN UNPREDICTABLE YOUNGSTER UNRELENTING BUREAUCRACY AND DEMANDING OFSTED INSPECTIONS IT CAN BE HARD TO SPOT THE CONCERTED EFFORT FOR A CHILD'S FUTURE
NO ONE DOUBTS THAT WE ALL WANT THE BEST FOR OUR CHILDREN KEEPING THEM IN OUR FOCUS AS THIS REPORT DOES IS UNIMPORTANT START AND DESPITE THE SERIOUS BLEMISHES IN THE CHURCH'S OWN RECORD THIS FOCUS ALSO SQUEEZE AT US ALL FROM THE PAGES OF THE BIBLE
CHILDREN AND WIDOWS ARE PRESENTED TO US AS PRIORITY CONCERN FOR SOCIETY SAINT LUKE THE CHURCH'S FIRST HISTORIAN DRAWS THEM FROM THE PERIPHERY OFF HIS OWN CULTURAL SETTING AND PUTS THEM AT THE VERY CENTRE OF JESUS'S MINISTRY MET THE CHILDREN COME TO ME SAID JESUS FOR THIS IS WHAT HEAVEN LOOKS LIKE
AND IN SAINT JAMES' STRIKING STATEMENT TRUE RELIGION IS TO REMEMBER THE ORPHANS AND WIDOWS AND TO PREVENT ONE SOLE FROM BEING POLLUTED
BUT ALSO IT HAPPENS BEST WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER
THIS YEAR AS WE CELEBRATE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF DOCTOR BARNARDO'S FIRST CHILDREN'S HOME IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING HIS WORD OF CAUTION ONLY DISASTER HE SAID CAN FOLLOW DIVIDED THIS AND OPPOSING WILLS
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND JOEL EDWARDS THE TIMES TENT AWAY HE'S NOT A VERY LONG AGO THE BRAZIL WAS THE PIN UP FOR THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES ON THE PLANET AND NOW FACES NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC CRISIS BUT A POLITICAL WARM AS WELL SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT RESHUFFLE SEVERAL TAKE TO THE STREETS TODAY PROTESTING THAT SHE IS THE TARGET OF AN ATTEMPTED COUP AND UNDEMOCRATIC
OUR GRAB SHE'S FACING NOT JUST IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS BUT THE COLLAPSE OF HER GOVERNING COALITION OF THE LARGEST PORT IN BRAZIL DECIDED TO QUIT EARLY THIS MORNING I SPOKE TO LEONARDO KINTEL DEPUTY LEADER OF THAT PARTY THE P. M. D. B. IN BRAZIL'S LOWER HOUSE
THAT WOULD BE P. ABOUT ONE ONE BUT REMEMBER
AND OUR EXPECTATIONS BUT THEY WERE GONE AND IT WILL BE GOT BUP BUP
OH PREGNANT AGAIN NO CORRUPTION PROBLEM I'LL PUT
COME ON THEN YOU SAY IT'S LARGELY ABOUT ECONOMICS IN TRUTH IT'S ABOUT POLITICS ISN'T IT YOU AND YOUR PARTY DON'T WANT TO BE BLAMED FOR BEING PART OF A DEEPLY UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT
YOU'VE GOT A BOOK OF THE PARLIAMENT OR BEHOLD AND I'LL PUT A BIT BERNIE BOOBY BOAT
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A BLACK WIG BIG NUMBERS CRASH AND YOU'RE QUITE QUIRKY BECAUSE I'VE GOT MY LIPPY YOU QUIRKY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ENOUGH OF THAT
BUT ON THE CATHAR COULDN'T I'VE GOT TO BE PLAY OR NOWT BIGGUN
IF THE PRESIDENT FALLS IT IS YOUR PARTY WHO HAS THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO IS SUDDENLY IN CHARGE
BUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BLOW ME GRAN CURTAIN RIGHT BELOW MY BOOK PARTY
HEY I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT
COULD PARAGON E.P. ALL YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE GARM GUMTREE WHO TRIED TO
WITH SOME EQUIVALENT SO GIVEN THE FACT YOU HAVE SUCH GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AMONGST INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS IT IS SURELY CRAZY TO BE IMPEACHING YOU'RE PRESIDENT THE FORMER PRESIDENT LULA AS YOU KNOW SAYS IT'S A FORM OF COU IT'S UNDEMOCRATIC
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN BETTERMENT
COULD BLUSH AND PROBABLY WITH CARPET CONSTITUTIONAL
BUT OUR COOKIE COOCHIE BIT MUM HEAPING BECAUSE
BUT IT COULDN'T BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHO HAVE GONE COULD BE IT COULD BE
WELL WHO CLIP UP THE GRAVEL IT YEP YOU DON'T GO BUMPING NOW ABOUT ONE BY ONE BOOBY OR LOOK AT YOU
OUR MEN WHO CLIP UP IT BE
ON TRACK AGAIN WE'VE GONE THERE HAVE A LOOK AT ECONOMIC BURMA
FINALLY WE ARE JUST SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM THE RIO OLYMPICS THIS WAS A TIME FOR YOUR COUNTRY TO SHOW ITS BEST FACE TO THE WORLD WASN'T IT THE DANGER IS THE WORLD SEES ROWING POLITICIANS ARE DECLINING ECONOMY AND EVERYONE CHARGING EVERYBODY ELSE WITH CORRUPTION
YEAH
PEOPLE FROM BUT THE MARPLE APRIL GLUE THAT ON
YOU'LL BE FINE BOTH JOHN IN BUNDLE OF PIGS
YEAH YOU'LL BE FINE WE WILL BE
COMFORTABLE THERE KIM
HE WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE YOU'LL BE FINE A BIT GO ON THEM
CHICKEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE HE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN THERE DIDN'T HE WELL CAMILLA COST OF THE B.B.C.'S BRAZILIAN SERVICE REPORTER CAN HELP US MAKE SENSE THAT WHAT HE'S REALLY GET WE'VE GOT WELL THERE IS DEFINITELY OBVIOUSLY AN ECONOMICAL PROBLEM BRAZIL IS FACING ONE OF ITS WORST RECESSIONS IN DECADES AND PRESIDENT DO MORE SURFACE LARGELY BLAMED FOR THAT THEY'RE CONTRIBUTES A LOT TO HER IN POPULARITY BUT THERE'S ALSO A STRONG VERY STRONG POLITICAL SIDE TO THIS
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE HE TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE HAS MANY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS ARE DEFINITELY HER PARTY THE WORKERS' PARTY HAS BEEN HEAVILY IMPLICATED IN ONE OF BRAZIL'S BIGGEST CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION SO FAR BUT SHE HASN'T BEEN ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION HERSELF ACTUALLY THE REASONS THE GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT ARE MOSTLY POLITICAL N. SHE'S ALSO ACCUSED OF FIDDLING WITH THE BRAZILIAN BUDGET
SO HER SUPPORTERS WILL TAKE TO THE STREETS TODAY WILL THAT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE EXACTLY SINCE THIS IS CONSIDERED A LARGELY POLITICAL PROCESS AT THIS POINT IT'S ALSO LIKELY TO BE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE STREETS THEY HAVE A MASSIVE DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
ENDED TODAY COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND TO ASSESS WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT IT CAN GATHER AND US TO EAT MAYBE THEY COULD SWING THINGS IN THEIR FAVOUR BUT THAT ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS START TWO SEEMS A BIT UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT AND WE HEARD MISKIN TAO THERE'S LITTLE BE SALT BY APRIL AND DON'T WORRY BE FIRED BY JUNE AT THE OLYMPICS ARE IN AUGUST YOU KNOW DON'T WORRY AHEAD INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
BRAZILIANS ARE DEFINITELY WORRYING BECAUSE ONE INTERESTINGLY EVEN THOUGH THE PRESIDENT HASN'T BEEN ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION HERSELF HER VICE PRESIDENT WHO IS FROM P.M.T. BE A HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS AND THE TWO HEADS OF THEIR HOUSES OF CONGRESS IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION ARE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR CORRUPTION SO BRAZILIANS ARE WONDERING AT THIS POINT WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT OR WILL THEY HAVE
BY THE OLYMPIC GAMES IF ANY OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE OLYMPIC GAMES THEMSELVES ARE NOT REALLY NOT REALLY DAMAGED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING SINCE THE PREPARATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE BUT THIS HAS A BIG EFFECT IN THE COUNTRY CAMILLA COSTA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT STAB WITH WEATHER

STUDENT PROTESTS ARE TEN A PENNY BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT I REALISE THAT THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR ACTION
IN BUSINESS WITH PETER DAY RETURNS THIS EVENING AT HALF PAST EIGHT ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR

GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING AN EMERGENCY MEETING IS TO BE HELD AT DOWNING STREET TO DISCUSS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO PREVENT THE CLOSURE OF TATA STEEL'S PLANTS A REVUE WAS CALLED FOR MORE SPECIALISTS IN END OF LIFE CARE TO BE AVAILABLE AROUND THE CLOCK FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES
AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE IN MY OWN TO GIVE SAYING SUE SHE POWERS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF A PRIME MINISTER AND TESTS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ON CHILDREN WITH CANCER WITH THE AIM OF DEVELOPING GENETIC TREATMENTS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY DIANA SPEED
DAVID CAMERON OR CHURN EMERGENCY MEETING IN DOWNING STREET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S OPTIONS FOR SAVING BRITAIN'S BIGGEST STILL MAKING COMPANY HE'LL BE JOINED BY MINISTERS AND SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM ACROSS WHITEHALL INCLUDING THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT FOR BUSINESS AND THE WELSH OFFICE THE MEETING HIS RESPONSE TO TATA STEEL'S DECISION TO SEEK BUYERS FOR ITS LOSS MAKING U.K. OPERATIONS MORE FROM OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
ALTHOUGH THERE'S PRAISE FOR THE RECORD OF TARTAR AS AN EMPLOYER THERE'S MOUNTING ANXIETY AND GOVERNMENT OVER THEIR TRUE INTENTIONS DESPITE EXTENSIVE TALKS WITH THE COMPANY MINISTERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SECURE ANY GUARANTEE OVER HOW LONG TATA IS WILLING TO KEEP THEIR STEEL PLANTS OPEN
PRIVATELY THERE'S CONCERN THAT TARTARE MAY BE RELUCTANT TO SELL THEM TO A COMPETITOR AND WOULD PREFER TO CLOSE THEM DOWN WITHIN WEEKS MINISTERS FEAR THE TARTARE MAY ALSO HAVE RUN OUT OF PATIENCE WITH LOSING A MILLION POUNDS A DAY IT'S ALSO POINTED OUT THE TARTAR ALREADY HAVE SPARE CAPACITY AT THEIR DUTCH PLANTS
ONE OPTION NOW BEING CONSIDERED BY MINISTERS IN ORDER TO SECURE MORE TIME TO FIND A BUYER WOULD BE TO MOTHBALL THE BLAST FURNACE AT PORT TALBOT THIS WOULD COST BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY MILLION POUNDS A MONTH
IT WOULD ALSO INVOLVE LAYING OFF ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF THE WORKFORCE IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT MINISTERS DID EXAMINE THE OPTION OF FULL NATIONALISATION BUT DECIDED IT WOULD BE TOO COSTLY
THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS JOHN MORTON WHO TRIED TO RESCUE M.G. CARS WHEN IT WAS PUT UP FOR SALE BY B.M.W. TOLD US HE DIDN'T FEEL ANY GREAT URGE TO INVEST IN TATA STEEL GIVEN ITS LOSSES AND WIDER PROBLEMS IN THE INDUSTRY THE CHINESE HAVE GROWN THEIR INDUSTRY ENORMOUSLY THEY FLOODED THE WORLD MARKET A STIRLING'S BEEN STRONG HOW THEY'VE GOTTEN HIGHER ENERGY COSTS THE MONEY OTHER COMPETITORS
I'M AFRAID IT IS PROBABLY MISSION IMPOSSIBLE AND A VERY VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD NEED TO GO AND TO COME UP WITH ANY CHANCE OF A WAY FORWARD

YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE UP TO A CERTAIN LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL SKILLS OF THE BED THE BEDSIDE WHAT TO PRESCRIBE AND HOW TO EXAMINE AND ASSESS PEOPLE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SITTING DOWN ACTUALLY PUTTING A HAND ON SOMEBODY AND TALKING
YOU KNOW FACE TO FACE SOUL TO SOUL THAT THAT REQUIRES A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON AND WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO BE AVAILABLE AROUND THE CLOCK
FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP HAS REVERSED HIS POSITION ON ABORTION ONLY HOURS AFTER SAYING THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PUNISHED IF IT IS REALLY CRIMINALISED AFTER COMING UNDER ATTACK FROM ALL SIDES INCLUDING CONSERVATIVE ANTI ABORTION GROUPS HE ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE DOCTOR PERFORMING THE TERMINATION SHOULD BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE NOT THE WOMAN

GLASGOW MOSQUES HEAD OF RELIGIOUS EVENTS AND HAFIZ ABDUL HAMED THE LEADER OF PAUL THIS MOSQUE WERE INVOLVED WITH SUPER ICE AFTER IT WAS BANNED IN THE U.K. IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THEY WERE DESCRIBED AS THE SCOTTISH AND U.K. HEADS OF THE ORGANISATION HOLDING MEETINGS IN ITS HONOUR
SEE PIES HARBOUR AN EXTREMIST POLITICAL PARTY IS ALSO BOUND IN PAKISTAN TOGETHER WITH ITS ARMED OFFSHOOT IT'S KILLED HUNDREDS OF SHIA MUSLIMS IN TERRORIST ATTACKS OBSERVERS SAY THEY'D BE EXTREMELY CONCERNED IF THERE WERE LINKS BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE ORGANISATION IN A STATE GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUE SAID ISLAM IS A FAITH OF P.

THE GOVERNING NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY IN MYANMAR HAS SUBMITTED A BILL TO PARLIAMENT THAT WOULD GIVE AND SONS CHI POSE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE CONSTITUTION BARS HOPING PRESIDENT BUT SINCE HER PARTY'S LANDSLIDE ELECTION VICTORY LAST NOVEMBER SHE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHE INTENDS TO ACT AS THE COUNTRY'S LEADER IN ALL BUT NAME A CORRESPONDENT JENNA OFFICIAL REPORTS FROM YOUNG GONE
ON SAINT SUIT SHE IS SEEKING TO FORMALISE HER ROLE AT THE HEART OF MYANMAR AS NEW GOVERNMENT THIS BILL CREATES A NEW POSITION ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT NOT THE PRESIDENT THE ADVISOR TO THE STATE OR STATE COUNSELLOR WILL HAVE FOUR OBJECTIVES DEVELOPING A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IMPROVING THE ECONOMY BUILDING A FEDERAL STATE AND DELIVERING PEACE
IT'S A BROAD REMIT CLOSE TO THAT OF A PRIME MINISTER BUT STOPS SHORT OF CONFERRING EXECUTIVE POWERS
BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THIS POSITION IS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ONLY AND THE NAME'S MISS SUE CHI AS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE ROLE
THE UN TRIBUNAL FOR WAR CRIMES IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IS ABOUT TO DELIVER ITS VERDICT IN THE CASE OF THE ULTRA NATIONALIST SERBIAN POLITICIAN BOYERS THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM INCLUDE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND RELATE TO THE FORCED REMOVAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CREATIONS AND MUSLIMS FROM THEIR HOMES BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS WELL AS MURDER AND SEXUAL ASSAULT HE WON'T BE IN THE HAGUE FOR THE HEARING BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN TO BELGRADE FOR TREATMENT FOR CANCER
GENETIC TESTS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT ON TUMOURS FROM CHILDREN WITH CANCER THE RESEARCH AT THE ROYAL MARSDEN HOSPITAL IN LONDON IS AIMED AT FINDING NEW TARGETED TREATMENTS AS A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER EXPLAINS
CANCER IN CHILDREN IS FORTUNATELY RARE BUT THIS MEANS THERE ISN'T A LARGE POPULATION OF PATIENTS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS OF NEW DRUGS SO INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS WHICH SPECIFICALLY TARGET CANCER CELLS WITHOUT DAMAGING HEALTHY ONES HAVE TENDED TO BE USED ON ADULT PATIENTS
THE NEW TEST WILL ANALYSE TISSUE FROM FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN IN THE U.K. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS GIVING SCIENTISTS FROM THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENETIC CHANGES WHICH ARE DRIVING THE GROWTH OF EACH CANCER TUMOUR THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL ENABLE DOCTORS TO MAKE A STRONGER CASE FOR USING TARGETED DRUGS ON SOME YOUNG PATIENTS POSSIBLY SPARING THEM FROM THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST FIRMS TO CLOCK CARS TO REDUCE THEIR MILEAGE SO THEY RESELL VALUE INCREASES AN INVESTIGATION BY THE SUN NEWSPAPER FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH KNOWINGLY SELLING A CAR SHOWING A FALSE MILEAGE IS AN OFFENCE JUST CARRYING OUT THE WORK IS NOT ILLEGAL
THANK YOU THE TIME JUST COMING UP TO TEN PAST EIGHT IS IT SERIOUSLY POSSIBLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMES UP WITH A WAY OF MAKING THE PATO BUT STEELWORKS INTO A VIABLE CONCERN SUCCEEDING WHERE THE STEEL SPECIALIST MULTI NATIONAL TART FAILED TURNING A MILLION POUND LOSS INTO PROFIT MAKING ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS ASSETS VALUABLE AGAIN IT FEELS LIKE A TALL ORDER AND YET OF COURSE THERE ARE COSTS INVOLVED IN LETTING PUT TALBOT COLLAPSE HUMAN COSTS
AS MANY AS FORTY THOUSAND LOST JOBS IN THE WORKS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY AND COSTS AS WELL OF RE TRAINING AND SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO THROWN OUT OF WORK IN A MOMENT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF UNITE LEN MCCLUSKEY BUT FIRST THE TOWN OF SCUNTHORPE LINCOLNSHIRE HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH REALLY WHAT IS A SIMILAR TRAUMA IN OCTOBER NINE HUNDRED WORKERS THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR JOBS WERE GOING THE LAST OF THE WORK HER FINAL SHIFT THIS WEEK BUT THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND MORE JOBS THAT ARE IN THE BALANCE AS BOB WALKER REPORTS FROM SCUNTHORPE
THEY'RE ACTUALLY RAIL THEY'LL BE GOING TO BELAY SOMEWHERE CHANCES WITHIN THE U.K. FOR THE TRAINS OF THE FUTURE TO RUN
ANOTHER BATCH OF STEEL LEAVES THE MAIN GATE AT SCUNTHORPE AND WITH PETER VICARS THE URBAN AND INDUSTRIAL CHAPLAIN THE NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE
A REGULAR VISITOR AT THE PLANT HE'S WITNESSED SOME DARK TIMES SINCE IT WAS PUT UP FOR SALE
IT WAS REALLY QUITE A DIRE PLACE TO BE BUT THEN WHEN THE LATTER OF UNDERSTANDING WAS SIGNED WITH GREY BALL BUT THERE WAS NO ALMOST INAUDIBLE
IN THE TERMS OF SOMEONE HAS SAID TO US YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO BUY
THEY HOPE THE DEAL WHICH WILL SAVE FOUR THOUSAND JOBS HERE WILL BE SIGNED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AT THE SAME TIME THIS HUGE SYMPATHY FOR THE PLIGHT OF THEIR WELSH COLLEAGUES
HAVEN'T GOT MY DOG COLLAR IT'S TO SAY THEY'LL BE GOING THROUGH HELL
WITH HERE THEY ARE BEING TOLD THIS FAR NO FURTHER WE'RE NOT TAKING YOU ANY FURTHER ON THIS JOURNEY
SO THINK OF A NEGATIVE EMOTION SADNESS SHOCK ANGER DISBELIEF AND THEY'LL ALL BE THERE
THE RAIN IN THIRD DIVISION NORTH CHAMPIONS THAT GOES BACK TO NINETEEN TONY GOSLING IS BORN AND BRED IN THIS TOWN PROUD TO WEAR A SHIRT TRUMPETING SCUNTHORPE UNITED GLORIES FROM THE FIFTIES HE'S A LOCAL COUNCILLOR AND UNION REP AT THE PLANT HE IS ACUTELY AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH IN WALES
THAT GOES OUT TO THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A TRAUMATIC TIME AND I'M LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO WORK AT PORT TALBOT AND THEY TALK ABOUT THE DEATH OF THEIR COMMUNITY IN THE DEATH OF THE TOWN BECAUSE IT'S VERY RELIANT ON THE STEEL INDUSTRY THAT'S VERY MUCH THE SAME AS OUR TOWN IN SCUNTHORPE WHERE WE WERE FEARFUL NOT ONLY FOR OUR JOBS IN THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY BUT ALSO FOR OUR COMMUNITY OUR FAMILIES AND THAT IN THE VERY FABRIC OF THE STEEL INTO WHICH COMPOTE WAS ARE BUILT ON IT ONLY EXIST BECAUSE OF THE IRON AND STEEL THAT WAS
OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE GROWN IN SCUNTHORPE OVER THE DECADES THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY WILL IN SOUTH WALES BUT HE SAYS THEY OFTEN DON'T MATCH THE STEEL WAGES
IT'S A QUALITY OF THE WAGE IT'S DISAPPEARING WHICH LOWERS YOUR LOCAL ECONOMIC BASE AND THEN WE HAVE THE LOWEST UNDER LIVE IN LOW HOUSE PRICES EXCEPT TRUCK AND THAT'S THE DETRIMENT TO THE COMMUNITY BUT OBVIOUSLY AT LEAST WE'VE GOT JOBS A YEAR AT LEAST WE'VE GOT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TOWN THAT I'VE GROWN UP
THE BERKELEY HOTEL A NINETEEN FORTIES LANDMARK THE TOASTER GENERATIONS WHO STEELWORKERS KEITH TOMLINSON WAS ONE OF THEM
HE STILL REFERS TO BRITISH STEEL NOT TARTAR AND THE SUITABLY NAMED BOB STEELS WORKED ON THE LOCAL PAPER FOR FORTY YEARS
BIG INDUSTRIES AND BRITISH STEEL'S ANNEXE TUTTA WITH HER TELL HER I'M SORRY THAT WAS THE WORST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED RIZAL WAVE TRAVELS FOR HER KNOWLEDGE TO IN THE SPHERE WERE US THAT'S WHAT I WEAR I THINK OF IT
AS THE JOBS ARE DISAPPEARED THE TOWN'S CHANGED BUT IT TAKES AN AWFUL LONG TIME FOR A TOWN TO RECOVER FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE WORKFORCE BUT FROM A CLOSURE INTERNET INCREDIBLE LONG TIME I MEAN I'M SURE THAT THIS HUGE SYMPATHY NOW IN SCUNTHORPE WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN IN SOUTH WALES THE FUTURE OF THE SCUNTHORPE
WORKS IS STILL FAR FROM SECURE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN TALKS AT THE MOMENT ABOUT THE BUYER COMING IN BUT NOTHING IS CERTAIN IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT FOR AN INDUSTRIAL NATION WERE STANDING ON THE VERGE AIR WAS TOTALLY LOSING A STEEL INDUSTRY ONCE IT'S GONE IT WILL NEVER COME BACK ROB WALKER REPORTING FROM SCUNTHORPE LEN MCCLUSKEY IS SECRETARY GENERAL UNITE AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING Q.C. A DIRECT ANALOGY BETWEEN WHAT WE DID FOR THE BANKS
AND WHAT WE COULD DO FOR STICK YES UNDOUBTEDLY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE TELLS US THAT WE PUT ONE THOUSAND BILLION POUND OF BRITISH TAXPAYERS' MONEY INTO THE BANKS IN ORDER TO SECURE THEIR CONTINUED SURVIVAL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE DAY FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING NOW THAT'S WHY WERE APPEALING TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO RECALL PARLIAMENT THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS OF ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS NOT JUST AFFECTING THE FORTY OR FIFTY OR SIXTY THOUSAND SHOWS THAT YOU MENTIONED YOUR STINT BUT INDEED AFFECT IN THE WHOLE OF OUR MANUFACTURING BASE
ISN'T IT IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT FOUNDATION INDUSTRIES LIKE STEEL IS PROTECTED IN ORDER THAT WE CAN HAVE THE MUCH VAUNTED MARCH OF THE MAKE ISN'T THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT TOOK WHEN NOT COMPARE STEEL TO THE BANKS WE COULD NOT HAVE FUNCTIONED AS A COUNTRY WITHOUT THE BANKS THE POINT WITH IS THAT IT'S MADE BY SIXTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD IT IS AVAILABLE CHEAPLY AS WE WELL KNOW FOR COMPANIES HERE THAT NEED TO USE IT WE DO NOT NEED TO
A STEEL INDUSTRY OF THE SIZE THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT OH YES WE ABSOLUTELY DO THAT'S TERRIBLY SHORT SIGHTED THE REALITY WHY WHAT IS THAT I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE REALITY IS THAT THE WHOLE OF OUR MANUFACTURING BASE AUTOMOTIVE THEME IN SECTORS THREE AEROSPACE DEFENCE ENGINEERING ALL REQUIRE STEEL ANCHOR A CHEAPLY IF WE YOU CAN'T BUY THEIR SPECIFIC STEEL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HIS LOW QUALITY CHINESE STEEL
MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DON'T TAKE ALL FALSELY BRITTEN ALLOWS A VAST MAJORITY OF IT TO COME INTO OUR NATION BUT JUST COMPARE THE SITUATION WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF EUROPE IN FRANCE INCHER EMILY IN ITALY IN BELGIUM ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES PROTECT THEIR STEEL INDUSTRY IN GERMANY THEY PRODUCED FOUR TIMES AS MUCH STEEL AS WE DID AND THEY HAVE THEY
VIBRANT MANUFACTURING BASED NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S HOT OLD POLICIES ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND ON A FUTURE INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING STRATEGY WILL BE COMPLETELY KNOCKED SIDEWAYS IF WE DON'T HAVE A ALL STEAMED IF WE'VE GOTTA IN PORT STEAL IT WILL CAUSE ALL KINDS OF BUT A KNOCK ON EFFECT WOULD ALSO IF WE WERE TO DO THIS CAUSE THE KNOCK ON EFFECT OF COSTING WELL AT THE MOMENT A MILLION POUNDS A DAY WE'RE HERE AND PUT IT ALL BACK
FOR ORDINARY WORKING PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND ARE SUDDENLY TOLD BY YOU AND PERHAPS BUY SOME OTHERS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS INDUSTRY COS IT'S VITAL FOR THE FUTURE OF ITS STRIKES YOU FAYE IT'S VITAL FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KNOCK ON EFFECT RIGHT THROUGHOUT CONNING IS ENORMOUS BUT WHERE'S SALE HANG ON HE SAVES FORTY THREE AT THE MOST NAUGHTY TRIPLE SIXTY THAT'S NOT HOW MANY PEOPLE OTHER EMPLOYED IN THIS CUTS NOTCHES SHE'S WHAT THIRTY THIRTY MILLION JUST STAPLE YOUR SON THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE RELIANT
ON AN INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY IS RUNS INTO MILLIONS RULES IT TO ABSOLUTE MILLIONS WE'VE GOT
THREE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WORKING IN MANUFACTURING AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS STUTTERING ALONE CAN CON DEVELOP WHAT GUTTERING MORE IF YOU MAY NOT BUT WHAT YOU PUT IT IN THE BOOK CONTROLS JUST STONE WELL SURELY TRUE ISN'T JUST ANSWER THAT NO YOU'RE WORKING IN AN INDUSTRY THAT USES STEEL AT THE MOMENT YOU WANTED TO BE CHEAP LET ME ANSWER THIS POINT WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF BUSINESS RATES AND IN TERMS OF ENERGY COSTS ARTHUR MOMENTS THE STEEL PRODUCERS IN GERMANY AND FRANCE
OR PAY LESS THAN HALF A STEAL PRODUCE SOME WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO THE GOVERNMENT AS THEY HAVE TO PROTECT IN THE WAY THAT OTHER GOVERNMENTS ARE PROTECTING OTHERWISE WE'LL SLICE BARREL I'M SUGGESTING TO USE THAT CHEAP STEEL
TO A REALLY GOOD THING IN AN AWFUL LOT OF INDUSTRY AROUND THIS COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY A LOT OF WORKERS LESSENING THIS WILL BE NEEDING STEAL TO STAY CHEAP IN ORDER THAT THEY KEEP THEIR JOB ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THERE'S DIFFERENT QUALITY LEVELS OF STEEL FOR EXAMPLE THE STEELED UP WE'VE JUST BUT YOU SAID HERE IS A LOT OF STEEL BEING IMPHAL NOTED THAT STEEL IS CHEAP YOU WON'T WEAR TARRAING ON SO LITTLE SUMMERS MUCH MORRIS SPENCER JUST JUST LISTEN TO ME FOR A MOMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TYPE OF QUALITY STEEL
THAT JUST COME IN FROM SWEDEN WE'VE JUST YOU SWEDISH STEEL TO BUILD ROYAL NAVY SHIPS UP IN SCOTLAND THAT'S LUDICROUS WHEN WE SHOULD BE USING OUR OWN STEAL THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD USE THEIR PROCUREMENT POLICIES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS LONG TERM COMMITMENTS FURTHER INFRASTRUCTURE OTHERWISE WE WILL FIND OURSELVES IN FIVE YEARS' TIME IN A MUCH WORSE SITUATION IN ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THE ONE MESSAGE I WANT TO SAY TO THE PRIME MINISTER
RECALL PARLIAMENT TAKE A PERSONAL VIEW OF THIS YOU SAM DO WHAT IN ORDER TO DEBATE AND DISCUSS LET'S SETTLE IT AS I DO WHAT WHEN IT COMES TO NAN LIKE ISATION WE'RE HERE THAT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF CAN'T AGREE BETWEEN MINISTERS AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHAT'S WHAT HOW FAR WOULD YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO GO I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT OUR INDUSTRY I DON'T CARE WHAT SEMANTICS WE TOUR BUT I ALSO WON AN MESSAGE SENT OUT
DON'T BE THINKING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A FIRE SALE THEN YOU GOING TO DISAPPEAR IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS LET'S SET UP HER MONEY A STEEL TASK FORCE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ALEC TAKE IT OVER TEMPORARILY ABSOLUTELY AS THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT IT IS THAT A MODEL WHAT YE ES I'VE GOT SALUTE YOU THINK THEY'VE DONE IT PROPER I THINK THEY'VE TAKEN A MEAN THEY'VE SENT A MESSAGE OUT THAT SAYS YES THE GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO TREAT THIS SERIOUSLY THE TRADE UNIONS WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL
FOR THE WHOLE OF OUR ECONOMY TO PROTECT THE FOUNDATION INDUSTRY AND ORDER THAT WILL YOU TELL US YOU CAN'T DO THAT PROTECTION AREN'T GETTING OFF LOANS AND ALL THE REST YOU DON'T TELL THAT TO ITALY TO BELGIUM TO GERMANY TO FRANCE OR TO ATTAIN AN EGG WELL I ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO THE SAME WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO A GOVERNMENT YES STANDOFF FOR BRITISH WORK IS PROTECT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE WHOLE OF OUR ECONOMY SO ARE YOU MEMBERSHIP A PROBLEM HERE DO YOU THINK
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A PROBLEM I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR GERMANY OR FRANCE SO LET'S NOT MAKE IT A PROBLEM FOR OURSELVES LEMMER CASKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY PAST EIGHT GLADIATOR PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN GRADE MAN TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE ALL GREAT HOLLYWOOD MOVIES OF COURSE THEY HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THEIR SOUNDTRACKS WERE WRITTEN BY HANS ZIMMER THE GERMAN BORN COMPOSER
HE'S WON GRAMMYS GOLDEN GLOBES AND AN OSCAR FOR THE LION KING WILL KNOW HE'S DOING SOMETHING HE'S NEVER DONE BEFORE EMBARKING ON A TOUR OF THIRTY EUROPEAN CITIES STARTING IN THIS COUNTRY PLAYING HIS MOST FAMOUS PIECES OF MUSIC THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONES HE WANTS TO BE FAMOUS AS A ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES HAS FOUND OUT
O.K. THAT SOUNDS A BIT STRANGE BUT I HAVE THIS FICTITIOUS PERSON I'VE ALWAYS WRITTEN FOR
SINGLE MUM IT'S GOT TWO KIDS LIFE HARD AND COME SATURDAY SHE JUST WANTS HER TO
NOT THINKING ABOUT THINGS AND YOU GO TO THE CINEMA AND SHE PUTS HER HEART MONEY DOWN AND WE BETTER ENTERTAIN HER SO THAT'S THE WAY RIGHT
THIS IS YOUR FIRST EVER TOUR WHY NOW
A GUIDE THAT SPENCER'S WHOLE LIFE IN ONE ROOM WITH NO WINDOWS AND NOT REALLY A LOT OF HUMAN INTO ACTION MY WARM UP GIG BEING WEMBLEY ARENA IS A BIT DAUNTING BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT YOU SAY DAUNTING BECAUSE YOU SUFFER FROM STAGE FRIGHT DON'T YOU YES IT'S BEEN INTERESTING REHEARSING THESE PIECES BECAUSE I REALISED
OVER THE YEARS BUT I DO AS I LIKE TO KEEP IT INTERESTING FOR THEM YOUR SESSIONS SO I WAS RIGHT A COUPLE OF TRICKY THINGS INTO IT TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET THEIR FINGERS
WELL NO IT'S ME WHO HAS TO GET HIS FINGERS THE RUB THIS AND I'M PRACTISING FURIOUS
GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING TRICKY YOU MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN A INTERSTELLAR THAT TOO MANY ORGAN PARTS ARE TOO MANY FAST NOTES
DICK YOU WAS
IT'S NOT JUST ME AND A DODGY PIANO I'M NOT A FOOL I GOT A REALLY GREAT BEAR WITH ME AND GOT JOHNNY HE TIGER MY FRIEND LEVEL EDWARD ADELINE KING WORTH
YOUR MUSIC IS NORMALLY IN THE BACKGROUND DOES THE FACT THAT IT WILL BE TAKING CENTRE STAGE GIVE YOU ANY PAUSE FOR THOUGHT LOOK PART OF MY JOB JUST GO AND WRITE A PIECE OF MUSIC THAT COULD LIVE APART FROM THE MOVIE
WHEN I WORK WAS CHRISTENED INCEPTION CHRIS HAD FINISHED THEY WERE EDITING AND I SAID CAN YOU SENT ME THE FILM HE GOES NO NOT UNTIL YOU'VE FINISHED WRITING THE SCORE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM THAT THE MUSIC COULD STAND ON ITS OWN TWO FEET
YOUR LATEST FILM BATMAN VERSES SUPERMAN SOME OF THE CRITICS HAVE SAID THAT THE MUSIC IS DROWNING OUT THE DIALOGUE AND I WONDER HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM THAT IS THAT YOU HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER AT ALL NO I DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF IT
NOBODY SETS OUT TO MAKE A INCOMPREHENSIBLE MOVIE WHEN WE
MIX THE FILM WE MIX IT TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD AND WE CAN HEAR EVERY WORD BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYTHING TO CINEMA THAT'S THE SAME SPEAKER AND SO WHAT'S OUR CHOICE CREATES TOWARDS THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OR TELL PEOPLE MAKE YOUR SOUND SYSTEM'S BETTER
RIGHT IT'S DOWN
UNLIKELY AS IT SOUNDS NOW HE ALSO WROTE THE THEME TUNE FOR THE QUIZ SHOW GOING FOR GOLD BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I WAS THE POOR STARVING MU SESSION IT PAID MY RENT FOR YEARS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE FIRST TIME I MET ROB TEMPLETON WHO WROTE THRILLER ALL THE GREAT MICHAEL JACKSON SONG
HE'S GOING YOU'VE GOT GOING FOR GOLD DOING MAY BE AND HE SINGS THE WHOLE THING GOING OH K. GREAT I JUST MET ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGWRITERS IN THE WORLD COULDN'T YOU KNOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT
I HAVEN'T EVER BRITAIN A PERFECT SCORE YOU SIT THERE BY YOURSELF AND THE BLANK PAGE STAIRS THAT YOU HAVE THE MOSQUE OR WAS I RIGHT THE WHITE AT THE PEACH SEEMS TO KURT COS THERE'S NOTHING LEFT IN THE DRAWERS IT'S GETTING MORE DIFFICULT ABSOLUTELY AND ARE YOU EVER CONCERNED IT MIGHT DRY OUT COMPLETELY THEN OH THAT'S THE CONSTANT FEAR BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MUSIC COMES
REBECCA JADE'S REPORTING THERE IT'S TWENTY FIVE PAST EIGHT DOUBLE TRUMPER SAID SOMETHING MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT OUTRAGEOUS AND THEN CHANGED HIS MIND AND ROWED BACK IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AT LEAST NOT DURING HIS RUN FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION AND IT HAS GOT AMERICA TALKING YET AGAIN ABOUT HIM HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IT WAS AN INTERVIEW WITH M.S. AND B. C. THE NEWS CHANNEL HE WAS PRESSED BY THE PRESENTER
AND HER FIRST APPEARED TO BACK PUNISHMENTS FOR WOMEN WHO HAD ABORTIONS IF ABORTIONS GOING TO BECOME ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES
BUT YOU WILL EVEN PUNISHMENT FOR ABORTION WAS A PRINCIPAL AT THE EDGE OR IS THERE
IT HAS TO BE SOME FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR THE ONE YEAH HAS TO BE SOME FORM TENSE ROUND YOU I DO I DO THAT I DON'T KNOW
JOHN CIRCLES HAVE BEEN HIS HIS NORTH AMERICA EDITOR WHAT'S GOT HIM HE'S TROUBLE HE'S NOT MAKING AN OUTRAGEOUS COMMENT AFTER ALL THE WHOLE CUT TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ONE SERIES AFTER ANOTHER OF KIND OF PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENTS WHAT'S GOT HIM IN TROUBLE IS THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF THIS TIME COMPLETELY ISOLATED AND HE DID SOMETHING THAT HE HASN'T DONE HITHERTO HE PERFORMED A U. TURN
WITH SCREECHING TYRE NOISES BURNING RUBBER AND BLACK TYRE MARKS ON THE ROAD SURFACE IT WAS THAT SUDDEN SO HAVING SAID WHAT IN THAT CLIP WOMEN SHOULD BE PUNISHED HE ISSUED A VERY LEGALISTIC HE WORDY STATEMENT SAYING IF CONGRESS WERE TO PASS LEGISLATION MAKING ABORTION ILLEGAL ON THE FEDERAL COURTS UPHELD THIS LEGISLATION OR ANY STATE WERE PERMITTED TO BAN ABORTION UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW THAT DOCTOR OR ANY OTHER PERSON PERFORMING THIS ILLEGAL ACT UPON A WOMAN WOULD BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE
NOT THE WOMAN THAT CONSTITUTES A FULL YOU TURN AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN FROM DONALD TRUMP UNTIL NOW AND THAT IS LEADING THE ANTI TRUMP REPUBLICANS TO THINK MAYBE HE IS ON THE RUN FOR THE FIRST TIME OR MAYBE HE IS NOW WITHIN SIGHT OF BEING THE NOMINEE AND HE'S BEING A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL
YEAH BUT THERE WAS A VERY INTERESTING DEFENCE OF HIM LAST NIGHT MADE BY DOCTOR BEN CARSON WHO'D ALSO BEEN ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN HOPEFULS WHO'S NOW BACKING DONALD TRUMP SAY IT WAS REALLY UNFAIR BECAUSE HE HADN'T HAD A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE WILL SING AS ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE LIVE WIRE ISSUES YOU CAN BE SURE IT IS SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT BUT HE GOT HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE SO I THINK THE CAUTION WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN TO HAVE GIVEN A DEFINITIVE ANSWER
TO PERFORM A U. TURN LIKE THIS IS NOT VERY TROMPETTE ESQ AND YOU KNOW AND THE SIX A SUCCESSION OF POLLS HAVE SHOWN A REAL VULNERABILITY AS FAR AS WOMEN ARE CONCERNED WHERE FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN SAY THEY TAKE AN UNFAVOURABLE VIEW OF HIM UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF WOMEN IN TOTAL SAY THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT HE STANDS FOR AND THAT IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR HIM IF HE IS TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND THEN GO ON TO FIGHT PRESUMABLY HILLARY CLINTON HE'S ALSO BEEN TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS
YEAH AND HE'S ALSO THAT'S ALSO CAUSED A STORM BY HIM KIND OF EFFECTIVELY REVERSING U.S. POLICY SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR SAYING HE'D BE PRETTY RELAXED IF JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA WERE TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT IF SAUDI ARABIA WERE TO GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE FINED BY HIM AS WELL AND THEN HE WAS ASKED IN THIS SAME INTERVIEW WHERE HE MADE HIS COMETS AN ABORTION WELL WOULD YOU USE A TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND HE SAID I REFUSED TO RULE THAT OUT AND THEN THE INTERVIEW
WHAT ABOUT EUROPE AND HE SAYS I REFUSED TO RULE THAT OUT TO US AT THE END HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUSLY SAYING YOU WOULD YOU MIGHT EXPLODE A NUCLEAR BOMB IN EUROPE AND HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO ROLL IT OUT AND I THINK THAT HAS CAUSED ANOTHER FEW RAW WITH PEOPLE STARTING TO SAY LOOK YOU HE'S BEEN A BIT IT'S BEEN A BRILLIANT BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN SO FAR BUT HAS HE THOUGHT THROUGH
EVERYTHING THAT HE IS NOW OFFERING AND I THINK AS THE SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES HOP HIM AS HE GETS CLOSER TO THE FINISHING LINE AT BECOMING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION SO A FEW CHINKS HAVE STARTED TO APPEAR JOHN SOAP AND WASHING TO MANX

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON READY FOR JUSTIN WEBB AND NICK ROBINSON TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE NOW AND TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FORGIVE ME FROM DIANA SPEED AN EMERGENCY MEETING IS BEING HELD IN DOWNING STREET IN RESPONSE TO TATA STEEL'S DECISION TO LOOK FOR BUYERS FOR ITS PLANTS IN THE U.K. IS UNDERSTOOD MINISTERS WILL SEEK ASSURANCES FROM THE FIRM THAT THEIR LOSS MAKING PLANTS WON'T BE CLOSED BEFORE A BUYER CAN BE FOUND
THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNION UNITE MCCLUSKY TOLD US THE PRIME MINISTER SHOULD TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HE CALLED AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS OF ENORMOUS PROPORTIONS HE CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF A STEEL TASK FORCE AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SAVE THE STEEL INDUSTRY JUST AS IT RESCUED THE BANKS IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS
A REVIEW OF END OF LIFE CARE HAS FOUND MANY HOSPITALS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE FACE TO FACE PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALISTS AROUND THE CLOCK THE REPORT LED BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ACKNOWLEDGES STEADY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT WARNS THERE'S IS STILL WORK TO DO
HAMAS NEW GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED THAT UNC SONS WHO CHI BE GIVEN A NEW ROLE SIMILAR TO THAT OF PRIME MINISTER IF THE PLANNERS APPROVE SHOULD BE NAMED ADVISOR TO THE STATE AND THE SONS WHO CHEERS BUD FROM THE PRESIDENCY ALTHOUGH HER NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY WON A LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER
SCIENTISTS ARE TO CARRY OUT GENETIC TESTS ON TUMOURS FROM HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN IN THE U.K. THEY ARE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM CANCER NEWER MORE TARGETED TREATMENT AVOIDING THE NEED FOR CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY THANK YOU DAINA TWENTY FIVE TO NINE SHOCKS THAT WAS THE WORD LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN CHOSE TO DESCRIBE HIS
REACTION TO THE GOVERNMENT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT NATIONALISING THE STEEL INDUSTRY PERHAPS JUST TEMPERATELY COULD BE THE SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IN IT NOW FACES WE'VE JUST HEARD UNITES LEN MCCLUSKEY SAY HE DOES BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT WHAT IS LABOUR'S POSITION AS SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL JOINT IS ON THE LINE FROM WESTMINSTER MORNING TO YOU MISTER MCDONNELL WILL TALK THROUGH THE DETAIL BUT JUST AS A HEADLINE FIRST OF ALL YOU DO BELIEVE THAT NATIONALISATION COULD BE AN ANSWER YES AS PART OF THE
FOUR POINT PLAN THAT PEOPLE ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS NATIONALISED TO STABILISE THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BACK THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR THOUGH THE COMPANY ITSELF THEN MAKE SURE THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT PARTICULAR THIS ISSUE OR BUSINESS RATES WHICH WE EXPECTED SUPPORT IN THE BUDGET BUT NEVER WAS FORTHCOMING AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE WE USE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT WITH A DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS USING BRITISH STEEL'S THAT FOUR POINT PLANK AS AN OPPORTUNITY THEN TO
SAY THEIR SECTOR AND ALSO SAVE THE JOBS THAT I'M FORTUNATE A RISK AT THE MOMENT AND GIVE SOME LONG TERM CONFIDENCE WITH A FUTURE THAT WILL HAVE A STEEL INDUSTRY THAT WILL NEED I WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAIL BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE HOPING THAT THIS IS TEMPORARY NATIONALISATION NOT PERMANENT AS WE SAW IN THE PAST SCOTLAND YOUR MODEL THEN BECAUSE THE S.N.P. LED GOVERNMENT HAVE AGREED TO DO JUST THAT TO TAKE OVER TEMPORARILY TO STILL PONDS BEFORE PASSING IT ON TO A PRIVATE
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN ALL OF THIS NOW THAT'S WHY WE CALL FOR THE RECALL OF PARLIAMENT SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DISCUSS THAT PLAN IN DETAIL AND THAT THE PRIME MINISTER COULD TAKE A LEAD IN THIS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN IN A BIT OF DISARRAY OF THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE WE WERE TOLD BY THE MINISTER THAT EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE SO NATIONALISATION WAS CLEARLY ON THE AGENDA THEN AND THEN THE OF ESTATE THEN RULED IT OUT TODAY
THERE'S A BIT OF CHAOS IN GOVERNMENT AND WE'RE TRYING TO SAY LOOK GET A GRIP NOW AND THEN COME TO PARLIAMENT WITH A CLEAR PLAN THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN BACK ON A CROSS PARTY PLACE YOU WANT TO DISCUSS A PLAN THE SCOTTISH PLAID AS YOU KNOW IS ON A TINY SCALE COMPARED WITH WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SAVE JUST PUT TALBOT NEVER MIND ALL THE OTHER ONES THE COMPANY SUGGESTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO INVEST TWO BILLION POUNDS TO TRANSFORM THAT INTO A COMPETITIVE PLANT
AND THAT IS AFTER YOU'VE DEALT WITH ONE MILLION POUND DAILY LOSSES ARE YOU SAY THE LABOUR PARTY WERE CHOOSING THE GREAT COMPETITION FOR RESOURCE WHETHER TO SPEND ON THE HEALTH SERVICE OR EDUCATIONAL BUILDING ROADS OR WHATEVER YOU'D SPEND BILLIONS OF POUNDS TO SAVE THE BRITISH STEEL INDUSTRY LOVED WIDOW ARE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND I GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IN THE LAST BUDGET THE GOVERNMENT REDUCED CORPORATION TAXES
AND ALSO REDUCE CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO THE RICHEST FIVE PERCENT WITHIN OUR COUNTRY WE WOULD NOT HAVE THAT PRIORITY WE WOULD RATHER USE THAT MONEY TO INVEST IN JOBS AND A STEEL SECTOR YOU ACCEPT THOUGH THAT IT WOULD BE A HUGE NET INCREASE IN SPENDING YOU'VE GOT MAIL YOU DO IT BY CHANGE THE ODD TAX CUT THAT THE TORIES WERE WELL WE WOULD IF WE HADN'T GONE AHEAD WITH THOSE TAX CUTS IT WOULD HAVE COVERED THE COST OF WHAT WE NEED FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY IT JUST ADDS UP IN THAT WAY AT THE SUMS WORK OUT THAT WAY
IT IS JUST DEMONSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE IN PRIORITIES THAT THERE ARE A BEER IS THAT YOU NEED A LONG TERM STABLE PATIENT INVESTMENT IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT SECTOR IN THE FUTURE TO PROTECT THEIR JOBS BUT ALSO WE KNOW
BUT THE REASON WE'RE GOING THROUGH THESE PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT IS AS A RESULT OF DUMPING OF STEEL BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ITSELF AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WHETHER THAT AND MAKE SURE WE PROTECT OUR OWN INDUSTRY JUST AS WE ARE OTHER AND OTHER COUNTRIES ACROSS EUROPE ARE DOING INVEST IN THE FUTURE AND O.K. THAT WAY WE HAVE A VIABLE INTO MALES GET OUT THAT DUMPING IS YOU'VE RAISED IT THERE IS ONE E.U. OFFICIAL QUOTED IN THE TELEGRAPH TO SET TODAY CLAIMING THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE SACRIFICED AND I QUOTE AN ENTIRE EUROPEAN INDUSTRY TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHINA
FOR SIGNING UP TO THE NUCLEAR POWER PROJECT AT HINKLEY POINT IN OTHER WORDS ACCUSING MINISTERS OF VITA WAITING ANTI DUMPING MEASURES IN BRUSSELS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY CLOSE TO BEIJING IS THAT EVEN YOUR VIEW IF YOU WERE IN OFFICE WOULD YOU DO IT DIFFERENTLY I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OUR GOVERNMENT HASN'T STOOD UP FOR OUR INDUSTRY IN EUROPE AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY HAVEN'T SUPPORTED
THE EXTENT OF PROTECTION MEASURES THAT OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE PUTTING FORWARD SO YOU WOULD PUT MORE TARIFFS ON THE CHINESE WE WERE JOINED WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECTED ON ONE OF THE DETAIL OF ENERGY PRICES MANY STILL PRODUCES NOT LEAST TATA SAY HERE'S THE PROBLEM ELECTRICITY IN FRANCE FIFTY PER CENT CHEAPER ELECTRICITY AND GERMANY TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT CHEAPER IN THE U.K. WHO PUT IT UP OH
MISTER ED MILLIBAND USED TO BE LEADER OF YOUR PARTY AND HE WAS OF COURSE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY SECRETARY THAT'S WHY WE'VE SUPPORTED MEASURES THAT IN ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRY SUPPORT THOSE INDUSTRIES BUT I GET THE EXAMPLE OF THE BUSY CUT IT WOULD YOU CUT IT THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT MEASURES THAT SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY OVERALL I THINK THE USES FORGIVE ME I DON'T WANNA MOVE ON TO BUSINESS RATES WOULD YOU CUT GREEN TAXES THAT MAKE ELECTRICITY MORE EXPENSE WE'VE ALREADY OF MEASURES THAT SUPPORT ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES WE'VE ALREADY SUPPORTED THAT
BUT THE ISSUE FOR US I THINK THE REASON I'M COMING ON TO BUSINESS RATES IS BECAUSE IT'S SO GROTESQUELY UNFAIR WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR COUNTRY'S AGAINST REST OF EUROPE ARE WRIT BUSINESS RATES ARE FIVE TO SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE REST COUNTRY LEST OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT IS JUST UNFAIR MIXES UNCOMPETITIVE AND LAST ONE DONATIONS THAT COULD BE INTRODUCED VERY QUICKLY WE THOUGHT IT WAS COMING IN THE BUDGET GEORGE OSBORNE NEVER INTRODUCED TO INSTEAD HE WENT TO TAX CUTS FOR CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND ELSEWHERE I THINK THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING UNDERSTOOD LAST BRIEF ONE
OF COURSE PEOPLE FEEL DESPERATELY FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED HERE IN COMMUNITIES THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DIRECTLY BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSE LOSE JOBS AND THEY MAY BE THINKING TODAY WHY SHOULD OUR TAXES GO TO NOT JUST BAILING OUT THIS FIRM NOT JUST RESTRUCTURING IT BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUY THE STEEL WHY
BECAUSE IN THE LONG TERM IT WILL PROVE COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST THE COST OF LOSING THOSE JOBS AS WE'VE SEEN ELSEWHERE IS THE COST OF DEVASTATION OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES AND REMEMBER WE WILL BE PAYING OUT IN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND ON THE OTHER BENEFITS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS ISN'T IT BETTER TO KEEP THEM IN WORK JUST AS WE DID
WITH THE LET'S TAKE THE CAR INDUSTRY WE INTO THREE ALREADY WHAT USE THE CAR SCRAPPAGE TEAM SIR SCHEME IT TURNED THAT INDUSTRY AROUND THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO HERE WITH A BIT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S GOT TO GET A GRIP AND IT NEEDS TO BRING PARLIAMENT TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DEBATE THE PROGRAMME THAT'S NEEDS TO SUPPORT A STEEL INDUSTRY JOHN MCDONNELL THANK YOU
IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE EVERY DAY IN BRITAIN AROUND FIVE CHILDREN ARE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER MOST OF THEM AROUND THREE QUARTERS ARE STILL ALIVE TEN YEARS LATER SURVIVAL RATES HAVE IMPROVED BUT THERE IS A NEW EFFORT BEING TALKED ABOUT TODAY TO GET ACCESS TO TARGETED MEDICINES WHICH WILL HAVE FEWER SIDE EFFECTS I'M BETTER RESULTS PROFESSOR PAUL WORKMAN IS THE C.E.O. OF THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND THE CHANGE WOULD BE WHAT
THE CHANGE WOULD BE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME THE NEW TEST THAT WE DEVELOPED AT THE ENSUED ACCOUNTS RESEARCH IN THE ROYAL MARSDEN WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN AND THIS WILL OPEN UP A NEW HORIZON FOR THE FIRST TIME OF SYSTEMATIC ADMINISTRATION HAVE TARGETED THERAPIES TO CHILDREN THIS HAS NEVER BEEN
POSSIBLE BEFORE AND IT WILL ALSO OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF ENCOURAGING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO DO MORE TRIALS IN CHILDREN AND THEREFORE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY DEVELOP NEW THOROUGH WHICH IS A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AREA IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT AREA FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THOSE TRIALS THERE AREN'T GREAT INCENTIVES FOR THE FARMER INDUSTRY TO DO THOSE TRIALS BUT WHAT THIS NEW TEST
IT WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO IS TO DO THOSE TRIALS BECAUSE THE GENETIC INFORMATION AND A TEST WILL BE READILY AVAILABLE AS A REASONABLE COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS PER TEST THAT WILL MEAN THAT THAT COMPANIES WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO DO TRIALS IN IN IN THESE PATIENTS AND WHAT DIFFERENCE COULD IT MAKE WELL I THINK THE
WHAT WE WILL DO IS OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SIMILAR RESPONSES ARE EVEN BETTER RESPONSES THAT WE ALREADY SEE WITH TARGETED THERAPIES IN ADULT PATIENTS
WHERE WE'VE SEEN GAINS OF SEVERAL MONTHS OR YEARS OF SURVIVAL WITH THESE NEW THERAPIES THAT WILL NOW BE APPLICABLE TO YOUNG PATIENTS BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WILL SPARE THESE PATIENTS THE A SIDE EFFECTS WHICH CAN BE QUITE DAMAGING FOR PATIENTS LISTEN AS WELL UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN CHILDREN ARE TREATED WITH WITH CANCER THEIR ORGANS ARE STILL
DEVELOPING THEY'RE STILL GROWING THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS STILL DEVELOPING MANY PATIENTS WHO ARE CURED AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN ARE CURED BUT OF COURSE TWENTY PER CENT OR NOT AND SOME OF THEM DO TERRIBLY BADLY DEPENDING ON THEIR GENETICS
BUT OVER THE TWENTY PER CENT THERE ARE CURED AT FIVE AND TEN YEARS OF THAT EIGHTY OF EIGHTY PER CENT A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM DO HAVE LONG TERM SIDE EFFECTS DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN TO THE HEART TO THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT TO THEIR HORMONAL BEHAVIOUR AND SO ON AND SO REALLY THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN THAN IS THE CASE IN
ADULT PATIENTS SO I REALLY WANT TO SPARE CHILDREN THOSE SIDE EFFECTS BUT ALSO INCREASE THEIR SURVIVAL AS WELL NO LEUKAEMIA AYE WHICH IS OF COURSE THAT THE CHILDREN DO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL KNOW OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE RELATIVES WHO HAVE CHILDHOOD LEUKAEMIA WHAT WISE AND HE CAME IN NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUR FOLKS AT THIS STAGE THE WEEK WE'RE GOING TO BE ROLLING THIS TEST OUT IN FOUR HUNDRED PATIENTS OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAVE DECIDED TO FOCUS THE TRIAL THIS THIS PILOT
STAGE TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS AND USEFULNESS OF A THERAPY ON PATIENTS WITH SOLID TUMOURS THAT'S BECAUSE PATIENTS WITH LEUKAEMIA ARE ALREADY BETTER CATERED FOR WITH WITH THE EXISTING THERAPY SO THEY DO BETTER AS A GREATER NEED TO APPLY THIS TESTING HAD TO GET NEW THERAPIES INTO INTO SOLITARY WAS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT LOU CAME LEUKAEMIC PATIENTS WON'T BE SUITABLE AND WILL CERTAINLY BE BRING IN THOSE TYPES OF
PATIENTS INTO THE INTO THE APPROACH IN THE FUTURE AND JUST PRAY FOR YOU DO YOU WILL CHOOSE THE CHILDREN WELL YOU BENEFIT FROM THIS
THIS STUDY THAT THE POPE WILL BE WERE EMISSIONS THINKING SOMEONE LISTENING NOW HAD A RECENT DIED SO THE WAY THIS WILL HAPPEN IS THAT WILL BE BRINGING IN TWENTY OTHER THERE'S THE ROYAL MARSDEN IN THE INSTITUTE CANCER RESEARCH WE ARE DOING THE INITIAL STUDIES WE'VE ALREADY LOOK USE THIS IN THREE PATIENTS ALREADY ACTUALLY JUST VERY RECENTLY
AROUND THOSE TWENTY CENTRES PATIENTS WITH THEIR FAMILIES WILL GO IN AND SEE THERE
DOCTOR IN THE NORMAL WAY AND THEIR DOCTOR WILL DECIDE IF THOSE PATIENTS ARE SUITABLE FOR ENTRY INTO THIS INTO THIS TRIAL PROFESSOR PAUL WORKMEN FROM THE INSTITUTE OF CANCER RESEARCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY PLEASURE IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES TONIGHT MAYBE GRIPPING WESTMINSTER BALL IS THE VIEW FROM BEYOND THE VILLAGE BEYOND THE BUBBLE ABOUT THE IN OR OUT REMAIN OR LEAVE Y. U. DEBATE JIM SPENT ALL MORNING IN INVERNESS FINDING OUT FOR US MORNING
I HAVE INDEED KNICKERS YOU KNOW AND FOR THE THIRD TIME GOOD MORNING WE'VE MOVED A LITTLE OUT OF THE MOTHER CITY OF INVERNESS NO THAT FAST GROWING CITY AND QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE WITHIN A TEN MINUTE DRIVE OF THE CITY THESE DAYS IT'S A VERY THRIVING PLACE WITH MOVED DOWN ALONGSIDE THE RUSHING WATERS AS YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR BEHIND ME OF THE A NESS COMING DOWN FROM THE LOCH WITH WHATEVER IT MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN
AND I'M HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL HIGHLAND MORNING WITH DAVID SUTHERLAND WHO WANTS LESS CASTLE LODGES LUXURY ACCOMMODATION HOLIDAY ACCOMMODATION HERE AND ALSO WITH ISLA CRUDEN WHO'S FROM A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH NEAR BEAULY AND YOU HAVE A FAMILY FIRM I THINK HEATING AND PLUMBING YOU PRESIDENT OF THE HIGHLAND WOMEN'S BUSINESS CLUB AND YOU WANT TO LEAVE THE E.U.
BECAUSE I THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AS TO THE BENEFITS OF THE E.U. BRINGS US YOU GET VARIOUS REPORTS TO SPENDING ON
IS IT THIRTY MILLION IS IT FIFTY FIVE MILLION THAT WE CONTRIBUTE IN A WEEKLY BASIS AND ONLY GET BACK ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT AND IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU YOUR MIND IS OPEN TO THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT OR DO YOU SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THE REASON YOU'RE NOT HEARING
THE DETAILS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IS IT YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE I THINK IF THERE WAS A CASE TO BE MADE WHITE WE NOT GET THESE HEADLINES WHY DO WE NOT ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE I'D BE DELIGHTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WHETHER IT'S INTANGIBLE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY QUANTIFY AS FAR AS PAINTS SHELLINGTON PENSER EUROS OF WHATEVER CURRENCY WERE TALKING
LET US KNOW WHAT IT IS WELL DAVID SUTHERLAND HERE IT YOU I THINK ARE A REMAIN MAN
WHY AND WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO EITHER CROONS QUESTION I'M FIRMLY BECAUSE I THINK THE BENEFITS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO GREAT BRITAIN HAD BEEN ENORMOUS MY THEORY YEARS AND GOOD MORNING PRIME MINISTER IF YOU'RE LISTENING BUT I THINK WHEN THE WHEN THE MANIFESTO WAS DEVISED SOME YEARS AGO THEY TRY TO WORK OUT WHAT THEY COULD SOAR TO THE EURO SCEPTICS AND THEY THREW A REFERENDUM ABOUT THEM AS I GOT CLOSER I THINK THEY BEGAN TO WORRY BUT I THINK THE CASE HAS BEEN MADE TO STAY AND I THINK WILL BE CATASTROPHIC
LOADS OF BUSINESSES IN SCOTLAND AND THE REST OF THE U.K. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS AND YOU'RE ENGAGED AND TOURISM PREVIOUSLY I THINK YOU WERE IN BUILDING AND SO ON
AROUND INVERNESS BUT YOU KNOW BRINGING TOURISTS HERE WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE SURE HE WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IF WE WERE IN OR OUT OF THE E.U. MECHANISM I THINK I THINK THE PLUNGE THAT LOOMS IN FRONT OF US IS IF WE COME OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS TO BE TEN YEARS OFF MASSIVE UNCERTAINTY ECONOMIC TURMOIL
PEOPLE WILL GET SCARED OFF COMING TO BRITAIN BECAUSE THAT THERE'LL BE THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM ISSUES AND I THINK THE TWO SMALL SHY AWAY I UNDERSTAND MARK RYLANCE CASE FULLY AS A SMALL BUSINESS NEGATIVE ON THIS
I THINK LOOK AT LOOK AT GREENLAND THEY COME OUT THE TOOTH SHE USED TO DO COUPLE WITH U.K. COMES OUT THIS TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS WHAT WHAT ABOUT THAT DOES THAT
AND INFLUENCE AS AN ARGUMENT UNCERTAINTY IS NOT GOOD FOR ANY BUSINESS WHATEVER THE SIZE YOU ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE NEED CERTAINTY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE COMMITMENTS INVESTMENTS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
I REALLY I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE INFORMATION TO BE PRESENTED IN AN AN UNDERSTANDING FORMAT THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT THE BENEFITS
THIS MENTIONED THE SIZE OF INVERNESS THE SORT OF TRAVEL TO WORK IN HERE AROUND INVERNESS IN THE FACT THAT THIS PLACE HAS EXPANDED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY RATE AND IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THIS IS THE MOST PROSPEROUS BIT OF THE U.K. BUT IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS YOU'VE SEEN THAT YOURSELF DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH EUROPEAN MONEY IN DEVELOPMENT OR NOT IN THE HIGHLANDS
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE INVESTMENT AS FAR AS EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND IN THIS PARTICULAR AREAS IS CONCERNED NO WE HAVE LOST OUT ON THAT WITH THE THE NEW MEMBERS JOINING WE'RE NOT IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS WE WERE
QUICK WORD WHO'S GOING TO WIN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD I WOULD SAY IN A SENTENCE I WOULD THINK THE STAY IN CAMPAIGN WILL WIN I THINK THERE'LL BE FIFTY FIFTY
ELLA CRWD AND DAVID SUTHERLAND BY THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NESS IS SHAKING HANDS THAT'S GOOD WITH THE SUN SHINING THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
A LODGER AND TIME TEN TO NINE A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUE HELD OFFICE IN A SECTARIAN GROUP THAT'S NOW BANNED IN THE U.K. AND PAKISTAN THE MOSQUE WHICH IS THE LARGEST IN SCOTLAND WAS ALSO USED FOR A SERVICE TO COMMEMORATE THE DEATH OF THE BAND GROUP'S LEADER THIS HAS BEEN UNCOVERED AS PART OF A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION OWEN BENNETT JONES HAS BEEN GATHERING REACTION IN THE COMMUNITY AFTER THE B.B.C. GOT ITS FINDINGS TO THE MOSQUE TO PEOPLE USE IT
IT TAKES IT TAKES MY BREATH AWAY THE B.B.C. HAVE INVESTIGATED AND EXPOSED THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON I KNOW THOSE WHO ARE IN POWER HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AND THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE ACTIONS OF THE SMALL MINORITY THAT'S THE RESPONSE OF GLASWEGIAN MUSLIM AND LAWYER AAMER ANWAR TO THE REVELATION THAT A SENIOR CLERIC AT GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUE HAD LINKS TO SEE BUT HE'S A HARBOUR AND ORGANISATION OFFICIALLY LISTED AS TERRORIST TAKE IN THE U.K. AND BANNED IN PAKISTAN TOO
FOUR INDIVIDUALS FROM A MOSQUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT WHAT IS A MODERATE MOSQUE IS
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC
IN YOUR YEARS OF ASSOCIATION WITH THE MOSQUE HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANY REFERENCE TO S.S.P. NO I HAVEN'T THAT'S WHY IT'S SO SHOCKING TO HEAR ABOUT THIS BECAUSE
THOSE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO PAKISTAN WERE PAKISTANI ORIGIN AS I AM ARE WELL AWARE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF SUPER SUB OUT THEY ARE A RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVE EXTREMIST ORGANISATION THAT TARGET THE SHIA COMMUNITY AND IN RECENT YEARS WITH THEIR CONTACTS WITH THE TALIBAN THEY REGARD CHRISTIANS JEWS AND ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T CONFORM TO THEIR PARTICULAR FORM OF FAITH AS LEGITIMATE TARGETS AND LIVED BY LEGITIMATE TARGETS I MEAN THAT THEY DESERVE TO DIE
OF OUR BARDS BITTERLY THOUGHT FOR THAT IF BOTH FAR BOTH COURTLAND IT'S ME GLASS COOKIE GOT SERGEANT IQBAL IS A B.B.C. JOURNALIST WHO ONCE WORKED FOR A LEADING NEWSPAPER IN PAKISTAN HE'S UNCOVERED SUPER ESO HARBOURS BRITISH CONNECTIONS WHICH EXTEND BEYOND GLASGOW
IT'S ALL DOCUMENTED IN THE GROUP'S OFFICIAL MAGAZINE IT SAVE THE FABULOUSLY WITH DESCRIBE HERE
PRESIDENT OF SPACE HAVE A SCOTLAND HOSTED IN THE DECEPTION IN HONOUR OF THE VISITING TH BOTH HAVE A LEADER BETWEEN ATTENDED BY THE WORK OF THE FAITH BY TH HARBOUR FROM GLASGOW IN LARGE NUMBERS
ALLY NAME THERE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS THE HEAD OF SEA BASS A HARBOUR SCOTLAND IS THE HEAD OF RELIGIOUS PROPAGATION AT GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUE
SUPER HARBOUR WAS NOT OFFICIALLY PRESCRIBED IN THE U.K. UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND ONE BUT EVEN AFTER THAT DATE THE ORGANISATION'S MAGAZINE CONTINUE TO REPORT ON THE GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUES ACTIVITIES
THIS IS HE PULLED OFF A MEMORIAL WITH THAT WAS ORGANISED THAT CLASSICAL SIMPLER MORE SKIN BOOT OF THEM THREE OF THE DEATH OF THE HEAD OF BOTH A BUY IN PAKISTAN IT WAS ATTENDED BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND IT'S THUMP IT ALI IF DEPORTED OR THIN BUT WOULD CONTINUE THE MISSION OF THE DEADLY DUFF BY FABER THIS IS JUST THE LATEST OF SEVERAL SCANDALS TO HIT SCOTLAND'S LARGEST MOSQUE IT'S CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF AN INVESTIGATION BY THE OFFICIAL CHARITY REGULATOR IN SCOTLAND
AND LAST WEEK IT HIT THE HEADLINES WHEN IT EMERGED THAT ONE OF THE IMAMS HAVE BIBA A MAN HAD SENT OUT ALL WHAT'S THAT MESSAGE PRAISING A CONVICTED MURDERER IN PAKISTAN SOME YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE MOSQUES CONGREGATION TRIED TO TAKE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MOSQUE LAST YEAR BUT THEN RESIGNED CLAIMING THEY'D SUFFERED THREATS AND INTIMIDATION
A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE GLASGOW CENTRAL MOSQUE SAYS ISLAM AS A FAITH OF PEACE AND WE OPENLY REJECT AND CONDEMN TERRORISM AND EXTREME VIEWS OF ANY KIND MISTER ALI REFUSED TO COMMENT
MODERATE MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION ARE APPARENTLY IN TURMOIL BUT SCARED TO SPEAK PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE MOSQUE AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING THAT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN INVOLVED THIS MEMBER OF THE CONGREGATION AGREED TO SPEAK TO US ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY HIS WORDS ARE VOICED BY AN ACTOR
THE YOUNGER GENERATION PAIN CAUSED DOORS THEY'RE VERY MUCH ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN I FEEL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SPEAK OUT AND SEE IF THIS IS WRONG BUT AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE TO LOOK AT MY OWN SITUATION YOU WANT SAFETY ME MY FAMILY
