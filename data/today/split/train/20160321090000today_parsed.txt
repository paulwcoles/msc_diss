YOU COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY AND LEAD TO THE LOSS OF NEARLY A MILLION JOBS BY TWENTY TWENTY THE VOTE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED AS DISMISSED THE CONCLUSIONS SAYING THAT BOTH THE ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW OUTSIDE THE E.U. IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JAWLINE
THE C.B.I. COMMISSION THE CONSULTANT'S P.W.C. TO ASSESS HOW THE ECONOMY WOULD REACT UNDER TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOLLOWING A SO CALLED REX HIT BRITAIN STRIKES IF FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR GOODS BUT FAILS TO GET FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE OTHER SCENARIO ASSUMES THAT BRITAIN WOULD DEFAULT BACK TO WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION RULES WITH LIMITED TARIFFS
THE C.B.I. SAYS THAT IN THE FOUR YEARS AFTER HER VOTE TO LEAVE UP TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS COULD BE LOST IT ADDS THAT EVEN IN THE BEST CASE BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE U.K. ECONOMY
NEW RESEARCH SAYS MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION SELF EMPLOYED PEOPLE WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHEN IT'S INTRODUCED NEXT MONTH THE LEFT OF CENTRE THINK TANK THE SOCIAL MARKET FOUNDATION SAYS LATEST FIGURES SHOW THAT ONE IN SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE U.K. WORK FOR THEMSELVES THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THE NEW WAGE WILL HELP MORE THAN A MILLION LOW PAID WORKERS

THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX THE WEATHER FROM THOMAS CHEF AN ACCURATE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING JOB VERY GOOD MORNING TEACHER ON AND EVERYONE ELSE THE WEATHER'S QUIET THIS MORNING ACROSS MOST OF THE U.K. THERE IS A TOUCH OF FROST IN WALES AND SOUTHWESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND BUT FOR MOST OF US IT'S ABOVE FREEZING IT WAS ABOUT SIX DEGREES IN LONDON JUST AN HOUR OR SO AGO AND FOR MANY OF US THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE CASE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE ZERO
AND TODAY A QUIET DAY ON THE WAY THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF CLOUD AROUND BUT NOT EVERYBODY FOR SOME OF US ACTUALLY TODAY WILL BE QUITE A NICE DAY FOR EXAMPLE IN SOUTH WESTERN ENGLAND FOR THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES THE SOUTH EAST
AND EAST ANGLIA I THINK SOME SUNSHINE DEVELOPING EVENTUALLY AFTER A CLOUDY MORNING AND ALSO IF YOU LIFT TO THE EAST OF THE PENNINES SO ALL THE WAY FROM THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND THROUGH NORTH EAST NORTH EAST PARTS OF YORKSHIRE DOWN INTO LINCOLNSHIRE I THINK A NICE DAY ON THE WAY TO THE CLOUD SHOULD BREAK UP AND IT SHOULD FEEL RELATIVELY PLEASANT AS TEMPERATURES GET UP TO SAY ROUND ABOUT TEN DEGREES IN LEEDS AND IF WE'RE LUCKY IN THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY
EVEN UP TO TWELVE TO FOURTEEN CELSIUS THE REST OF US AROUND THE IRISH SEA COASTS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND MUCH OF SCOTLAND IT IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY CLOUDY DAY AND EVEN ONE OR TWO LITTLE SPOTS OF RAIN I THINK OF THE WESTERN ISLES OF SCOTLAND NOT MUCH CHANGES TONIGHT SHOULD BE GENERALLY FROST FREE TEMPERATURES IN MOST TOWNS AND CITIES WILL BE AROUND THREE OR FOUR DEGREES THIS COMING NICE AND THEN TOMORROW AGAIN WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN SOME SUNNY BREAKS HERE AND THERE BUT ESSENTIALLY SPEAKING
IT'S A QUITE CLOUDY SORT OF DAY WITH TEMPERATURES AGAIN HOVERING AROUND EIGHT TO TEN DEGREE SO QUIET BUT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TOM IT'S A SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX OR LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND YOU CAN PREDICT WHAT'S ON EVERY FRONT PAGE AND ONE WORD WAR FEATURES ON MOST OF THEM CIVIL WAR ENGULFED THE TORIES AS HOW THE MALE PUTS IT CAMERON FIGHTS TO CALM CIVIL WAR SPOT BY DUNCAN SMITH'S EXIT IS THE F. BUDGET TORIES PLUNGE INTO OPEN WARFARE SAYS THE GUARDIAN TOP TORIES AT WATERS THE MIRROR
WITH THE HEADLINE DAMNED YOU'VE TO TURN INSIDE FOR THINGS THAT TELL YOU A LITTLE MORE THAT YOU'VE SEEN AND HEARD AND READ IN RECENT DAYS FASCINATING DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD IN THE TIMES IN WHICH DANIEL FINKELSTEIN FRIEND OF GEORGE OSBORNE TAKES ON TIMBER GONE MARIE FRIEND OF IAIN DUNCAN SMITH
WHAT'S MY WITTGENSTEIN SAYS IS THAT MISTER DUNCAN SMITH PROPOSED REFORMS TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM OVERSPENDING IN DISABILITY BENEFITS OR GREED THE REFORMS AND THEN RESIGNED OVER REFORMS HE DESIGNED AND AGREED THAT'S THE ANGER COMING FROM THE CHANCELLOR MY MONTGOMERY ON BEHALF OF IAN DUNCAN SMITH REPLIES BUT PERHAPS LIKE GEOFFREY HOWE NEARLY THREE DECADES AGO
HE WRESTLED FOR HIS CONSCIENCE FOR TOO LONG BEFORE GOING PUBLIC WITH HIS CONCERNS BUT MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE MOST UNPOPULAR WELFARE CUTS BUT ONLY RECENTLY DID HE CONCLUDE HE WASN'T MAKING ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE ANY MORE THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE ROW BETWEEN THE TWO MEN AND THE TWO SIDES THE SUN DOESN'T LEAD WITH THAT STORY IT LEAVES THE STORY ABOUT THE N.H.S. NATIONAL HANDOUT SERVICE
AS IT HAS IT ON THE FRONT PAGE IT SAYS A STRUGGLING HOSPITAL SPENT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ON TREATMENT AND CARE FOR ONE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PORTSMOUTH HOSPITAL'S TRUSTED ISN'T IT IS AMONG SEVERAL WRITING OFF HUGE SUMS SAYS THE SUN AFTER TREATING MIGRANTS WHO CANNOT PAY A PENNY
IT QUOTES IT PROFESSOR ANGUS DALGLEISH CANCER EXPERT HE SAYS WHEN I STARTED IN CANCER TREATMENT A COURSE OF DRUGS COST AROUND ONE THOUSAND NOW IT'S SIXTY TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE COST IS HUGE NO OTHER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD COULD COPE WITH IT AND THE ABUSE OF THIS SYSTEM
MUST BE STOPPED THE SUN WINS THE PRIZE TWO I THINK FOR THE MOST ORIGINAL TAKE ON THE TORY SPLIT AND THE HEADLINE UNCIVIL WAR ITS COLOUR RATHER FETCHING PICTURE HAVE BEEN DUNCAN SMITH AS THE ROUNDHEAD AND GEORGE OSBORNE AS THE CAVALIER WITH DAVID CAMERON SAYING DRESSED IN THE CLOTHING INAPPROPRIATE TIME WE MUSTN'T LOSE OUR HEADS OVER THIS AND HE SAID MISTER DUNCAN SMITH LIKE ONE WELL IT'S PRINCIPLED
BELIEVES IN PARLIAMENT SUPREMACY AND HAS STRONG RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HE ALSO HELPFULLY THE PAPER POINTS OUT HAS AN EXTREMELY ROUND HEAD MY OSBORNE LIKE ROYALIST SUPPORTERS IN THE SIXTEEN FORTIES AND OLD ETONIAN CAMERON HE IS ACCUSED OF BELIEVING THAT THEY HAVE A DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX PRESIDENT A LOT OF GOOD MEET RELATIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THE PARIS TERROR ATTACKS FOUR MONTHS AGO TODAY I'M JOINED BY OUR BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT GAVIN LILY THIS HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE SUMMER AND THE MAN WHO SAID THERE'D BE BEHIND THOSE ATTACKS GAVIN IS IT IS THAT IT CAN OR IS THERE A CONNECTION THERE
THERE HAVE BEEN A LONGSTANDING SIR REQUEST FROM SOME OF THE FAMILIES TO MEET FRANCOIS LONGDON THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM OF THE FAMILIES WHO LOST HER DAUGHTER SAID THEY WERE ASKED FOR A MEETING WITH ALL OF THEM THEY WERE STUNNED THEY WERE TOLD THERE WAS NO TIME IN HIS SCHEDULE TO DO THAT HE HAD MET A SMALL NUMBER OF FAMILIES BEFORE THAT SO I THINK THAT'S CLEARLY THERE ISA LISTS AT CERTAINLY THE PRECEDENTS TO THE TIMING GIVEN THAT SOLAR HAD THIS LAMB HAS NOW BEEN CAUGHT
AND TO BRING UP TO TAKES QUITE A FEW QUITE A LOT IN TERMS OF DETAIL JOHN'S IT'S HAVE SLIPPED OUT OVER THE WEEKEND FROM VARIOUS OFFICIALS HE HAD THIS LAMB IS NOW IN A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON IN BRUGES HE'S TOLD WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS CO OPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS THAT HE'S GIVEN AT DETAILS OF HIS ROLE IN PARIS THAT HE'S CONFESSED TO SINCE PLANNING ANOTHER TERRORIST ATTACK THIS TIME IN BRUSSELS AND WE FIRST HEARD
FROM THE FOREIGN MINISTER THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER DIDIO RAYNAUD'S SAYING THAT AT THE SLAM HAD SAID HE WAS PLANNING TO CARRY OUT A SECOND ATROCITY IN BRUSSELS AT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE PRECISE INDICATING WHERE OR WHEN BUT THE MINISTER SAID IT'S CREDIBLE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF HEAVY WEAPONS IN THE FIRST INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY FOUND THIS NEW NETWORK AROUND HIM SUPPORTING HIM IN BRUSSELS THAT THEY'VE ARRESTED THIRTY PEOPLE NOW IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARIS ATTACKS AND THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL THIS CELL IF YOU LIKE WAS AROUND TEN PEOPLE
AND ON TOP OF THAT THE FRENCH PROSECUTOR FRANCOIS MILLIONS HAVE HAD TO SLAM WAS CLAIMING TO INVESTIGATORS HIS ROLE ON THE NIGHT WAS TO BE THE FOURTH SUICIDE BOMBER AT THE START OF THE FRANCE HE CHANGES HIS MIND HE CAME BACK TO BELGIUM AND THIS MORNING BUT THE LAWYER THOUGHTS ON AT THE SLAM SVEN MARIE IS THREATENING TO START LEGAL ACTION HE'S SAYING THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HEARD OVER THE WEEKEND BY THE TICKLEY THE FRENCH PROSECUTOR IS BREACHING CONFIDENTIALITY KEVIN MANY THANKS
IT'S TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX A BRITISH BUSINESSMAN WILL LEARN TODAY IF HE'S TO SPEND YEARS IN PRISON IN DUBAI FOR ALLEGEDLY SENDING AN OFFENSIVE TWEET ABOUT A BUSINESS PARTNER THE MAN IN QUESTION IS DAVID HAIG WHOSE WANTS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB HE'S ALREADY BEEN HELD IN DUBAI FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS MARK THE BELL IS FOLLOWING THE STORY
TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY JUST BEAM UP NICK WE'RE WITNESSING A BUSINESS DISPUTE BETWEEN A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD ENGLISH SOLICITOR HIS FORMER EMPLOYER GOLF BASED INVESTMENT HOUSE WHICH THEY DID BY LEGAL SYSTEM APPEARS TO FAVOUR ONE SIDE JUST TWO YEARS AGO DAVID HAIG WOULD HAVE SPENT THE WEEKEND WATCHING LEEDS UNITED PLAY AT ELLAND ROAD AS THEIR MANAGING DIRECTOR AND ON THE PHONE TO TORY COLLEAGUES IN HIS BID TO BECOME AN M.P. BUT AFTER PHONE CALLS WITH HIS FORMER EMPLOYER INTO BY G. F. H. CAPITAL AND A TRIP TO SEE THEM TO DISCUSS A NEW JOB ALL THAT CHANGED
HIS TRIP WAS OVERSHADOWED BY A FINANCIAL DISPUTE AND HOURS AFTER TOUCHING DOWN IN DUBAI AFTER ENTERING THE G. F. H. OFFICES HE WAS ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF FRAUD OR LOCKED UP HIS LAWYER ALAN JONES Q.C. VISITED HIM IN MARCH LAST YEAR AND CLAIMS THAT HE WITNESSED SOMETHING THAT HE FOUND VERY DISTURBING
HE'S PLAYING THE SUFFERING IN CUSTODY HE WAS STRAINED HE WAS ANXIOUS THAT HE WAS AGITATED DAVID HICKS' CASE IS THAT AFTER HE WAS IMPRISONED IN MAY TWENTY FOURTEEN HE WAS THREATENED BUT HE HAD TO SETTLE THE CASE OR THINGS WOULD GO BADLY FOR HIM IN PRISON
AND ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF MARCH A NUMBER OF LAWYERS WILL PRESENT AND ON MEDICATION A PRISON GUARD CAME IN AND SAID THAT THE LAWYER FORGING OUTFIT CAPITAL LIMITED HAD REPORTED TO HIM
DAVID HAIG HERB SAID IN COURT PROCEEDINGS IN ENGLAND THAT IS PRISON CONDITIONS WERE BAD AND WAS THAT TRUE THE PRISON GOT ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO WITHDRAW PRIVILEGES FROM DAVID HAIG IN PRISON ON THOSE PRIVILEGES WERE VERY LIMITED
THAT WAS PLAINLY A THREAT AND NUMBER OF LAWYERS WITNESSED THAT GEOFF H. CAPITAL DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGATIONS MADE THERE BY ALLEN JONES SAYING THEY WERE NOTHING NEW AND DAVID HAIG IS SIMPLY REGURGITATING ISSUES THAT ARE BEING DEALT WITH BY THE AUTHORITIES PREVIOUSLY G. F. H. CAPITAL HAD SAID IT HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE DUBAI AUTHORITIES WHICH RESULTED IN MY HAGUE BEEN CONVICTED OF A BREACH OF TRUST FROM HIS TIME WORKING FOR HIS FORMER EMPLOYER
DAVID HAIG WAS THEN DUE TO FLY BACK TO THE U.K. LAST NOVEMBER BUT JUST DAYS BEFORE HIS RELEASE THEY WERE NEW CHARGES AGAINST HIM THESE ARE THE ONES THAT I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING THE IDEA THAT HE DEFENDED HER FORMER EMPLOYER ON TWITTER NOW WHAT'S THAT THAT IS A BREACH OF THE LAW ON CYBER CRIME THAT'S RIGHT NOW DAVID SAY DAVID HAIG SAID HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AS HE WAS IN PRISON AND SUPPORTERS WERE RUNNING HIS ACCOUNT IN HIS NAME THE AUTHORITY TO SPENT FOUR MONTHS JUST CONSIDERING THIS CASE
HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH HAVE SAID THESE CYBER CHARGES A REPRESSIVE AND THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT MUST NOW CALL FOR MY HAIG'S IMMEDIATE RELEASE AND I SPOKE TO THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANDREA JENKINS A FRIEND OF MY EGGS FROM WEST YORKSHIRE SHE SAID THAT MY HAY COULD GIVEN THE FOREIGN OFFICE A DOSSIER OF HIS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TREATMENT TO BUY AND SHE FEARS FOR HIS WELFARE
THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAVE SAID THEY'RE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO MISTER HAGUE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN TO MY SUPPORTERS ARE CLEARLY HOPING FOR SOME GOOD NEWS TODAY AFTER SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS BEHIND BARS FOR HIM THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKELY IN THE MEANTIME I'VE REPEATEDLY TRIED TO SPEAK TO THE AUTHORITIES IN DUBAI I'M YET TO HEAR BACK FROM WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CASE LATER MARK ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIXTEEN IS PLUS SIX WE'RE COMING TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR OR A TURBULENT ONE FOR THE LONDON STOCK MARKET BUT IT'S NEARLY BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE IT STARTED A YEAR AGO SO
WAS IT JUST A STORM IN A TEACUP ALL THAT TO A MORE ADAM FOR A NEW FACE IN THE STUDIO AS A BUSINESS MAN THAT IS THE BUSINESS PRESENTER ADAM WELCOME THANK YOU YOU'RE A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR THE MARKETS HAD SEEN A ROLLERCOASTER OF A RIDE INVESTORS JITTERY OVER SLOWING CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FALLING OIL PRICES BUT RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD SOMETHING OF AN UPTURNED DAVID COMING AS HEAD OF U.K. EQUITIES AT STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS MORNING DAVID MORNING
WE'VE STILL GOT PROBLEMS WITH THE CHINESE ECONOMY AND WE'VE STILL GOT RELATIVELY LOW OIL PRICES SO WHY IS THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BOUNCING BACK WELL IT'S NOT JUST ONE WONDERED SIMPLY WON'T INTO POSITIVE TERRITORY LAST WEEK AS WELL FROM THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWELVE YEAR BUT I THINK IT'S JUST NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE
THOUGHTS THAT CHINA'S HOLDING UP RELATIVELY WELL THE PROPERTY MARKET'S PICKING UP CONSUMER AND THERE ARE STILL GROWING ROBUSTLY AND THEIR CURRENCY THE STOP FLOWING TO THAT'S GOOD NEWS EUROPE STILL GROWING DRUGS PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM PROBABLY WORRIES ABOUT DEFLATION THE OIL PRICE AS BUT ALSO OVERTIME OIL COPPER
THEY'RE ALL TRAINING AT SORT OF THREE MONTHS TIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY U.S. ECONOMY STILL GROWING STILL CREATING JOBS U.S. INTEREST RATES STILL GREW UP NOT AS FAST AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT BUT IT'S JUST NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE EXPECTED AND SO IT WAS A BIT OF A A BIT OF A FALSE ALARM I THINK IN THE U.K. IT'S ONLY PROTECTS IT THAT'S THE MAIN OUTSTANDING WRISTS BUT MARKET COULD TRENT STILL TREND UP FRONT WAS THERE A BIT OF CONTAGIOUS PESSIMISM THEN DO YOU THINK
THERE IS A BIT OF THAT A LOT OF THE INVESTORS WHO ARE MACKEREL DRIVEN TEN TO COPY EACH OTHER A BIT IT'S NOT TOO DEROGATORY BUT AND YOU GET THESE TRAINS DEVELOPING AND A LOT OF A SORT OF LACK OF EMOTIONAL CONTROL AND LOGIC TENSE EXASPERATE THE HIT BUT THINGS HAVE GOT A BIT BETTER AND IT'S QUITE LOGICAL THAT THE MARKETS I THINK PICKS UP AND VALUATIONS ON THAT HORSE
IF WE GET THROUGH THE REFERENDUM I THINK WE COULD WE COULD SEE POSITIVE TREND CONTINUE ONE OF THE BIG HITTERS IN THE THIRTIES AND I GOT TONY WERE DUE TO BE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF B.P. HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ENERGY COMPANY JANELLE IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE GIANT COMMODITY COMPANY GLEN CORN IS NOW SETTING UP A NEW HEDGE FUND FOR DISTRESSED ALL IN GAS STOCK HAS HE REALLY GOT THE TIME FOR THAT
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK IT'S IN A SILLY IDEA BECAUSE THERE MAY BE DISTRESSED OLD GAS ESSENCE TO INVEST AND I THINK WITHOUT BEING UNKIND TO ME HERE BUT I SUPPOSE THE B.P. OIL DISASTER JANELLE'S BEEN A BIT OF A DISASTER AS WELL IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION DOING INGRID'S AND AND OIL ACQUISITION OF GLENCOE WHERE WILL TIME SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
HE IS STILL THERE SO IT'S A GOOD RECORD OF BAD LUCK WILL SORT OF MEAN REVERT TO BACK HIM BUT HE'S GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
I THINK THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ALL PRICES HAVE GONE UP A BIT OR MARKET WAS ALREADY SORT OF DISCOUNTING FIFTY SIXTY DOLLAR THE ROYAL OR MORE SO YOU HAVE TO BE RELATIVELY BLUEISH BUTTER OIL PRICES I THINK TO INVESTMENT FUND LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE A DIFFICULT CALL A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RECORD OF BAD LUCK I THINK THAT'S A EUPHEMISM HIT IN THERE DAVID COMING FOR THE MOMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
AS WE HEAD TOWARDS THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN JUNE THAT DAVID JUST MENTIONED WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MANY ARGUMENTS PRO AND CON FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THIS MORNING THE CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY CLAIMS LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE U.K. ECONOMY THE RESEARCH AND A BUSINESS ORGANISATION CLAIMS ANY SO CALLED BRECHT'S IT COULD SEE THE LOT OF NEARLY A MILLION JOBS ON EFFECT ON THE CASE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BUT COULD BE AROUND ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS THE FINDINGS DID EXAMINE TWO DIFFERENT EXITS AND R.
BUT HE'D COME UP WITH ONE STRONG MESSAGE GROUPS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE HIT BACK AT THIS REPORTER READY ONE OF THEM VOTE LEAVE SAYS IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN SPIN AND SCAREMONGERING AND THAT IN FACT THE U.K. ECONOMY WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW AFTER A POSSIBLE EXCELLENT WELL BUT THIS IS THE C.B.I. STRUCTURE GENERAL CAROLYN FAIRBURN AND ALSO UN HULSE FROM VOTE LEAVE ELLEN IS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF SILVER CROSS PRAMS GOOD MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU KAREN FAIR BUT IF I CAN START WITH YOU SOME HUGE NUMBERS A LOT OF CAVEATS IN THIS REPORTS FROM COUTTS AND MITES MAYBES
AND YOU JUST PRESENTING AT OUR WORST POSSIBLE CASE SCENARIO HERE NO NOT AT ALL IT'S FOLLOWING UP A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS LAST WEEK WHICH I HAD A VERY STRONG VOTE FOR FOR FOR STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE SAID WE WANT TO INFORM THE DEBATE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS REPORT IS HE'S IS HE'S HERE TO DO IT'S ANNALISE'S SAY TWO SCENARIOS OF LEAVING BUT ONE OF THEM IS REALLY WHAT WE WERE CALL PLAIN SAILING IT TAKES THE
U.K. STRAIGHT INTO NEW FREE TO A THREAT OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EUROPE GRANDFATHER'S RIGHTS WITH WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES ROUND THE WORLD HAS ALREADY CAST REMOVED FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HAS NO PRODUCTIVITY OF IT AND STILL DELIVERS A SERIOUS ECONOMIC SHOCK DRIVEN LARGELY IN THE SHORT RUN BY INSERT BY UNCERTAINTY AND THE ECONOMY NEVER QUITE RECOVERS TO WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE REMAINED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION
ALAN SO THIS ISN'T A C.B.I. REPORT THIS IS A P.W.C. AN INDEPENDENT REPORT PRETTY ALARMING STATISTICS WOULD YOU SAY WELL IT'S IT'S MONDAY MORNING AND IT'S ANOTHER C.B.I. REPORT ON ON ON THE ROAD DEAR
IF I RUN MY BUSINESS IS FOR YEARS AND IF I'D HAD AS MANY MISJUDGEMENTS AS A C.B.I. I'D BE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED IT WAS A C.B.I. YOU KNOW ADAM THAT SUPPORTED THE EXCHANGE GOING INTO THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM A DISASTER IT SUPPORTED GOING INTO THE EURO I THINK THE DIRECTOR GENERAL THE TIME ADAIR TURNER
DISMISS CRITICISM OF THE EURO WAS TOTALLY AN INFORMED AND ONLY IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN THIRTEEN SO TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE C.B.I. SAID IT'S LOOK BEYOND THE POLITICAL RHETORICAL IN WEIGHING UP THE PROS AND CONS AND CONCLUDED THAT STAYING IN THE E.U. WAS OVERWHELMINGLY IN OUR INTERESTS AND SUGGESTED THAT THAT STAYING IN THE WAS WORTH THREE THOUSAND POUNDS PER HOUSEHOLD THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE C.B.I. SAID IN NOVEMBER THIRTEEN
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT CHECK YOU'LL SEE THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS NO GRUDGES SUGGESTS A CONSISTENCY OF OPINION DOESN'T IT NOT A THING WRONG WITH HER IF YOU READ THE FACT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS IF YOU READ THE FACT WHAT IF YOU READ THE FACT CHECK ADAM THAT PRODUCED ON THAT THREE THOUSAND IT WAS SHOWN ACTUALLY TO BE TOTALLY AND UTTERLY INVALID AND THAT IS MY CONCERN MY CONCERN BASICALLY IS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS GETTING THE SCARE STORIES OF THE FIERCE STORIES
AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS REPORT OF P.W.C. THE ASSUMPTION NUMBER ONE IS THAT THERE WILL BE NO FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN WITH THE U.S. IF WE WERE IF WE WERE TO HER BRECHT'S IT WERE MY PERSONAL OPINION
I'VE TRADED ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE TRADED IN CHINA I'VE TRADED IN JAPAN I'VE TRADED IN THE FAR EAST A LOT WE WILL GET STRAIGHT FREE TRADE AGREEMENT POINT NUMBER TWO THEY SUGGESTED OR TAKE FIVE YEARS TO REACH A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WELL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FIGURE FROM THE POORER THAT CEDRIC IS A LOT OF UNREALISTIC OR SUCH A LOTS OF ASSUMPTION IN TERMS OF BRITISH INDUSTRY
THEY'RE JUST A LOTS OF UNKNOWNS TO BRITISH BUSINESS IS NO ENOUGH TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION REALLY FIRST WALK AND I CORRECT ALAN THERE HIS ASSUMPTION OF FREE TRADE ROUTE DEALS IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH BOTH THE E.U. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THAT'S NOT CORRECT I THINK THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS THAT WE KNOW WE HAD ONE THING IS KNOWN HERE WE HEAD INTO A PERIOD OF EXTRAORDINARY UNCERTAINTY THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS NOT SET OUT WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE MIGHT LOOK LIKE
WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE FOR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF DEAL THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE PREPARED TO GIVE US AND THE UNCERTAINTY WOULD CREATE A SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY WHICH ACTUALLY I THINK MOST ECONOMISTS WOULD NOW AGREE WITH WHAT P. W. C. HAVE TRIED TO DO IS TO PUT SOME LEVEL OF MAGNITUDE ON THAT ROUND ABOUT THREE TO FIVE PER CENT A REDUCTION G.D.P. BY TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS UNDER PRETTY MODERATE AND SOME MIGHT SAY OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTIONS
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AND HE CAN HAVE HER BURMA FROM THE C.B.I. AND ALAN HALSALL FROM VOTE LEAVE NOW FROM A POSSIBLE BRECHT IT'S A A NEW EUROPEAN DIRECTOR OF THE COMES INTO EFFECT TODAY THE RULES AROUND GETTING A SECOND MORTGAGE ARE BEING TIGHTENED AS THE MORTGAGE CREDIT DIRECTIVE COMES INTO AFFECT ITS E.U. WIDE LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO CREATE UNIFORM CONSUMER PROTECTION OF HORSEMEAT WITH A DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE LENDERS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE STANDARD OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IN OTHER PARTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE RAISED TO THE LEVEL WHICH U.K. CONSUMERS HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE MORTGAGE MARKET REVIEW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO HOW IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO AFFECT OUR MORTGAGE MARKET NOTABLY I THINK AROUND BUY TO LET
I THINK THAT THE KEY ISSUE ABOUT BUY TO LETTERS OR CALLS NOT GENERALLY SEEN AS A BUSINESS INVESTMENT SO THAT ISN'T THAT ISN'T COVERED IN THE SAME WAY WHAT I FIT IN I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT THERE ARE MANY CONSUMERS IN THE U.K. WHO WILL NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE AT ALL THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SMALL SUBSET OF BUY TO LET LANDLORDS WHAT ARE REFERRED TO AS ACCIDENTAL LANDLORDS WHO FIND A LEVEL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AVAILABLE TO THEM
INCREASED A BIT BUT GENERALLY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF MORTGAGE APPLICANTS IT WILL LOOK VERY MUCH THE SAME TODAY AS THEY DID ON FRIDAY SO DOES IT MATTER OR IS THIS A BIT OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION THAT WE COULD DO WITHOUT
I THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF BRINGING THE REST OF THE SINGLE MARKET UP TO THE STANDARDS WHICH BRITISH CONSUMERS HAVE ENJOYED I DON'T KNOW IN A FEW YEARS' TIME YOU MAY SEE A VASTLY MORE COMPETITIVE MORE INNOVATIVE MORTGAGE MARKET ACROSS EUROPE I DON'T KNOW I MENTIONED THAT THE BUY TO LET MARKET THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT THIS WILL PUT EXTRA PRESSURE ON IT AND IT'S A PRETTY PRESSURISED MARKET AT THE MOMENT IS IT
WELL IT'S A MARKET IT'S GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION THERE'S A LOT OF TAX CHANGES GOING THROUGH THAT WILL AFFECT THOSE WHO ARE BUY TO LET LANDLORDS WE KNOW THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THE MARKET TO SEE WHAT ITS IMPACT ON FINANCIAL STABILITY WILL BE BUT I THINK GENERALLY THE MARKET SEEMS IN REASONABLE HEART WHAT IS KEY I THINK IS TO ENSURE THAT THE MARKET DIGESTS ONE OF THESE CHANGES BEFORE MORE CHANGES WERE THRUST UPON IT
THANKS TO THOSE POST ME THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ADAM IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SIX ROB BONNET IT WITH THE SPORT MY MORNING KISS ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL TENNIS STORY TO REPORT THIS MORNING THIS TIME PROVOKED BY COMMENTS OVERNIGHT ABOUT THE WOMEN'S GAME FROM THE B.N.P.

YOU COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY AND LEAD TO THE LOSS OF NEARLY A MILLION JOBS BY TWENTY TWENTY THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED THE CONCLUSIONS SAYING THAT BOTH THE ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW OUTSIDE THE E.U.
NEW RESEARCH BY THE LEFT OF CENTRE THINK TANK THE SOCIAL MARKET FOUNDATION SO THERE'S MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION SELF EMPLOYED PEOPLE WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHEN IT'S INTRODUCED NEXT MONTH THE GOVERNMENT INSIST THE NEW WAGE WILL HELP MORE THAN A MILLION LOW PAID WORKERS
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE TORY LEADERSHIP HAS PROBABLY HAD WORSE WEEKENDS BUT IT'S HARD TO THINK OF ONE OFF AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAVE ANYTHING DAVID CAMERON CAN DO NOW OUR SYSTEM TO POLITICAL EDITOR IS NORMA'S WHO WAS ALWAYS GOING TO DO TODAY NOMINEES HAVE APPEARED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND SAY WE REALLY ARE COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH IS IT
IT MAY INDEED ONLY BE A SHORT TERM PALLIATIVE BECAUSE THE FISSURES AND STRAINS WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOW ARE SO PROFOUND IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW MISTER CAMERON THROUGH THE SPACE OF ONE COMMON STATEMENT CONCEIT TO BIND THE PARTY BACK TOGETHER BUT HIS AIM TODAY WILL BE TO REASSURE LAW TO BE AT HIS MOST EMOLLIENT AND ACCOMMODATING TO SHOW HE'S LISTENING THE REACHING OUT TO HIS PARTY
THE DIFFICULTY EVEN IN THE SHORT TERM IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC CAUSE OF MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS EVEN ON THAT ISSUE WITH THE VIEW IN GOVERNMENT REMAINS THAT PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE THE BILL FOR THEM IS SIMPLY GOING UP TOO FAST
AND MAYBE BUT NOT NOW BUT SOONER OR LATER THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REFORMED APPARENTLY THE COST HAS BEEN GOING UP BY AROUND A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND THERE ARE SOME M.P.S WHO TAKE THE VIEW THAT THE FAILURE TO GET ON TOP OF THE ESCALATING COST OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS ALLIED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OVER UNIVERSAL CREDIT ARE EMBLEMATIC OF THEIR FAILURE
OF THE D.W.P. TO GET A GRIP OF THE SORT OF ISSUES CYCLE IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET PERSONAL INDEPENDENTS PAYMENTS ARE TAKEN OFF THE IMMEDIATE
TIMETABLE THAT LISA GAPING FOUR BILLION POUND IN MY HUSBAND'S ALREADY VERY OPTIMISTIC AMBITIONS OF BALANCING THE BUDGET THAT MONEY WILL HAVE TO BE FOUND FROM SOMEWHERE AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE FUTURE OF MISTER OSBORNE WHETHER HUGH ANY LONGER HAS THE POLITICAL CAPITAL TO CARRY THROUGH AN AUSTERITY AGENDA TO MAKE FURTHER SAVINGS IN THE WAKE OF
TAX CREDIT YOU TURN LAST YEAR THE CLIMBDOWN HAVE OVER PENSION REFORMS LAST MONTH AND NOW THE DEBACLE OF PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENTS AND THERE IS GROWING SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER MISTER OSBORNE WILL BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN POST AFTER THE BRECK SIT A REFERENDUM OR WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE TO BRING IN A NEW CHANCELLOR NOW THIS MORNING NUMBER TEN
A VERY FIRMLY QUASHING THE IDEA THAT THERE IS ANY RIFT OR DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN MY CAMERON AND MISTER OSBORNE THEY DENY ABSOLUTELY REPORTS AT MISTER CAMERON WILL SEEK TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
FROM MISTER OSBORNE AND THEY INSIST THAT THE TWO MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY STILL TOGETHER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE MUST NOW BE A QUESTION ABOUT THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE CHANCELLOR BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BUDGET ITSELF THERE ARE THOSE SAYING THE BUDGET SHOP MUST HAVE ANOTHER ONE
WELL I DOUBT I DOUBT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY DESIRE TO REVISIT THE BUDGET BECAUSE THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME JUST SORT OF POURING OIL ON THE FLAMES I MEAN I THINK THE DIFFICULTY IN TRYING TO JUST
DRAW A LINE UNDER THIS IS THAT ALTHOUGH MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S RESIGNATION MAY HAVE BEEN PROMPTED SPECIFICALLY BY THE ROW OVER DISABILITY BENEFITS
THIS IS PART OF A MUCH WIDER AND FUNDAMENTAL CLASH BETWEEN TWO COMPETING WINGS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHICH BY AND LARGE HAS BEEN PUT OFF SINCE MISSUS THATCHER'S TOPPLING AND THAT IS THE CORE QUESTION OVER WHETHER THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS TO BE A PRO OR ANTI EUROPEAN PARTY AND THAT IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH ALL THIS IS BEING FOUGHT OUT AND IT IS INDICATIVE THAT WHEN MISTER DUNCAN SMITH
A RESIGNED THOSE LINING UP BEHIND HIM THOSE ISSUING STATEMENTS ON HIS BEHALF WERE ALL THE BRICKS ARE TEARS AND THOSE LINING UP BEHIND MISTER OSBORNE ROLL THE PRO EUROPEANS AND IT'S INTERESTING TO SPECULATE WOULD MISTER DUNCAN SMITH HAVE MADE THIS ONSLAUGHT IF THE CHANCELLOR HAD BEEN A PRO BRECK'S A CHANCELLOR I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH INDEED AND I GET THE SENSE WE ARE NOW ON THE CUSP OF THE FINAL RECKONING WITHIN THE TORY PARTY OVER THIS ISSUE
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN VIVA OBAMA VIVA FIDEL THAT WAS THE CHANT FROM THE CROWDS THAT LINE THE STREETS OF HAVANA THIS MORNING PRESENT OBAMA LANDED IN THE CUBAN CAPITAL LAST NIGHT AND HEADED DIRECTLY TO THE U.S. EMBASSY
THE BODY WOULD BE IT'S BEN NEARLY NINETY YEARS SINCE A U.S. PRESIDENT STEPPED FOOT IN CUBA IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE
BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT PRESIDENT COOLIDGE CAME ON A BATTLESHIP IT TOOK HIM THREE DAYS TO GET HERE IT ONLY TOOK ME THREE
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AIR FORCE ONE HAS LANDED IN CUBA THIS IS A HISTORIC VISIT AND IT'S A STRAW HAD OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THE CUBAN PEOPLE OUR CORRESPONDENT WILL GRANT TOLD ME THAT THE WHOLE ISLAND IS ENTHUSED ABOUT THE VISIT
THERE REALLY IS EXCITEMENT AND NOT JUST ON THE STREETS OF HAVANA ACROSS THE ISLAND IT'S ALL ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT SINCE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT RE ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC TIES WAS FIRST MADE OUT COVERED THE BREADTH LENGTH AND BREADTH OF CUBA AND I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE EVERYONE I SPEAK TO SAYS THEY
REALLY NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D LIVED TO SEE THE DAY THEY CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT'S MOVED SO FAR WHEN YOU THINK HOW ENTRENCHED FIDEL CASTRO WAS AGAINST SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE MANY MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS DAY WOULD NEVER COME SO IT HAS BEEN GREETED WITH REAL EXCITEMENT YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THINK IT JUST MARKS THE START OF A FUTURE PERHAPS A FUTURE FOR THEM INSIDE CUBA WHERE IS
THEIR PARENTS' GENERATION PERHAPS FIGURED THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY'D BE ABLE TO GET ON IS IF THEY LEFT SO I'VE MET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FEELING ENERGISED BY THIS VISIT AND THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP MORE GENERALLY THE QUESTION PRESUMABLY ON THE ONE SIDE IS WHETHER THE CUBANS WILL MOVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS POLITICAL RIGHTS DEMOCRACY AND WHERE THE AMERICANS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE ON THE TRAY BLOCKHEAD
THAT'S RIGHT THOSE ARE THE KEY ISSUES AREN'T THEY I SPOKE TO CUBA'S LEAD DIPLOMAT FOR U.S. AFFAIRS COURSE ATHENA VIDAL AND SHE SAID EVERYTHING WAS CERTAINLY ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT CERTAIN ISSUES WERE ABSOLUTELY NON NEGOTIABLE THEY WERE SOVEREIGN AFFAIRS FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE IN THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT NOT TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND SHE SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA
TO THE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ON THE ISLAND THINGS OF THAT NATURE IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T DISCUSS THESE MATTERS AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS IS THE KEY THING THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDERSTOOD THAT PERHAPS PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS
DIDN'T OR CHOSE NOT TO BY THAT I MEAN THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO ADDRESS THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AS EQUALS KNOWING THAT ASKING THEM TO MAKE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS OR CHANGE CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM THE WAY THEY RUN THINGS SIMPLY WON'T RUB WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT UNDER AROUND CASTRO AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET ON THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT EACH OTHER AS THEY ARE
WE'LL GRANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE WAS A SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MY MURDERS AND MANSLAUGHTER AS IN ENGLAND AND WALES LAST YEAR NO ONE SEEM QUITE SURE WHY WELL NOW THERE IS A THEORY THAT IT MIGHT BE DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO LIVE HERE FROM EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TOM BATEMANS A CORRESPONDENT ON THIS TOM KILLING EACH OTHER
THIS WAS SOME OF THE COMMENTARY THAT WAS AROUND AT THE TIME THAT THOSE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS CAME OUT IN JANUARY AS YOU SAY THERE WAS A RISE IT WAS QUITE A SHARP ANNUAL RISE IN THE MURDER STATISTICS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THAT WAS A RISE OF AROUND SEVENTY ONE CASES OF MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER IN ENGLAND AND WALES NOW WE SHOULD SAY THOSE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS ARE QUITE LOW IT'S ALWAYS QUITE HARD YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM WITH CAUTION ABOUT SAYING THEIR PARTICULAR TRENDS AND THEY ARE HISTORICALLY LOW ACTUALLY THOSE NUMBERS BUT THERE WAS SOME THEORISING ABOUT WHAT
CAUSE THAT SHARP INCREASE AND CERTAINLY THERE WAS ONE UNNAMED MURDER DETECTIVE SAYING WE ARE SEEING CASES ANECDOTALLY HAVE FIGHTS WITH IN LOW PAID MIGRANT WORKER HOUSES MEN FROM EASTERN EUROPE IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE DIED NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S INTRIGUING CLAIM AND SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT WHETHER IT STANDS UP AND WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT IT CERTAINLY THERE WERE CASES LAST YEAR I'M IN BOSTON IN LINCOLNSHIRE LOST YOU THREE
MEN DIED IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS A LOT OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS THEY'RE OH THIS WAS A LATVIAN MAN ABSOLUTELY OF COURSE IN THE TOWN BECAUSE HE HAD AGRICULTURAL FACTORY WORK AROUND THERE TO LITHUANIANS AND ALLOW THE MEN DIED AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE CASES APPEARED TO BE THIS KIND OF THING WHERE A FIGHT HAD BROKEN OUT ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED AND PEOPLE'D LIKE TO THEN THE KEY THING AS WELL IS THIS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IS THERE A TREND THAT PEOPLE NEED TO GET HOLD OF ONE CRIMINAL CRIMINAL JUST WE SPOKE TO SAID
THERE AREN'T THE DE ESCALATING FACTORS THAT YOU GET WHEN YOUNG MEN FIGHT WHEN ENGLISH YOUNG MEN FIGHT IT TENDS TO HAPPEN IN PUBS IN TAXI QUEUES IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN THERE ARE FACTORS OF DE ESCALATION COS PEOPLE THE POLICE GET INVOLVED ABSOLUTELY WHEREAS THE IDEA WAS HERE THERE AREN'T THOSE THE ESCALATING FACTORS AND THE VIOLENCE BECOMES
MUCH WORSE WHAT IMMEDIATELY HAPPENS WHEN YOU START TO TRY AND DRILL DOWN INTO THOSE STATISTICS WE GOT PUT ON TO THE HOME OFFICE THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT NATIONALITIES ON NOT COLLECTED THEY'RE NOT RECORDED AS PART OF THIS DATA WHICH WAS A STRIKING FACT IS OF COURSE THEN PRESENTS A PROBLEM SO WHAT WE DID WAS TO TAKE ALL THE OPEN SOURCE INFORMATION PLEASE PRESS RELEASES THE COURT REPORTS
AND CERTAINLY THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THESE CASES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT LOOKED AT TWELVE OR SO AS PART OF THIRTY TWO CASES OF MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER IN WHICH AN EASTERN EUROPEAN PERSON WAS BOTH VICTIM AND PERPETRATOR OR SO AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE IF THE ASSUMPTION IS OLD MORE PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED IN BRITAIN THAN WE THOUGHT
DECISIONS WILL BE TAKEN BASED ON THAT AND PERHAPS THEY SHOULDN'T BE A DINNER SET A DECISION SHOULD BE DAY YEAH I THINK THE PROBLEM WE HAD IS YOU CAN YOU CAN START TO LOOK INTO THIS AND YOU GET A BIT OF A SENSE O.K. IT'S HAPPENING THERE'S NUMBERS ARE VERY LOW WE CAN LOOK AT AT LEAST SORT OF TWELVE CASES THAT LOOK LIKE THIS IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO WAS VERY HARD TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT COS WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE GOT ALL THE INFORMATION IF WE LOOKED AT ALL THE CASES AND WHAT YOU REALLY NEED OF COURSE IS THE OFFICIAL DATA TO BE LOOKING AT NATIONALITIES AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE STRIKING
THAT ISN'T THE CASE CERTAINLY ETHNICITY ETHNICITY IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT LOOKS BLACK CRIME VERSES WHITE CRIME IN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT NOT NATIONALITIES AND JUST ONE OTHER STRIKING POINT LAST YEAR THERE WERE THE DEATHS OF NINE LITHUANIAN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW GIVEN THAT THERE'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LITHUANIANS IN
IN THEIR POPULATION AS A WHOLE THAT'S ABOUT FIVE POINT THREE PERCENT POPULATION SO THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER AND THEIR REPRESENTATION IT TOM MORE ON THIS LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE PAPERS TODAY
TURMOIL CHAOS AND MOST FREQUENTLY CIVIL WAR OF THE TERMS USED BY THE PAPERS TO DESCRIBE THE CURRENT SITUATION INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE F.T. CALLS IT THE TORIES BIGGEST PUBLIC ROW SINCE THEY WON BACK DOWNING STREET IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE MAIL IN THERE SOME THINK IT'S WORSE THAN THAT WORSE SINCE THE DAYS OF JOHN MAJOR IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE GUARDING QUOTES ONE M. P. IS SAYING THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH LOBBED A GRENADE INTO THE PARTY WITH HIS RESIGNATION THE INDEPENDENT ADDS TO THE TWISTED THE KNIFE WITH THE SAVAGING OF THE LEADERSHIP
YESTERDAY IN A B. B. SEEM TO BE THE PAPERS AS DAVID CAMERON GEORGE OSBORNE ARE FACING THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET TO THEIR AUTHORITY LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND OF IT ALL IS EUROPE IN SPITE OF MISTER DUNCAN SMITH ASSURANCE THAT HIS DEPARTURE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE MIRROR SAYS HIS MOTIVES FOR RESIGNING A DUBIOUS IT'S COLUMNIST KEVIN MAGUIRE SAYS ONCE AGAIN EUROPE HAS UNLEASHED HADRONS WHICH THREATENED TO DESTROY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
THE EXPRESS THINKS THAT FURY IS A DEVASTATING BLOW TO DAVID CAMERON'S FIGHT TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY IN THE SAYS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS PUSHED BRITAIN CLOSER TO THE EXIT WHETHER OR NOT HE MEANT TO THE GUARDIAN AGREES HAS DONE SHE'D HAVE BEEN WEAKENED WANTED THAT THAT COULD BE A NATIONAL DISASTER FOR THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM THE SUN PREDICTS THAT OPERATION MIDLAND A POLICE INVESTIGATION INTO HISTORICAL ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE BY ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES
IT'S FINALLY SET TO COLLAPSE TODAY IT SAYS THE FORMER TORY M.P. HARVEY PROCTOR IS TO MEET DETECTIVES AND IT'S BELIEVED THE CASE AGAINST HIM WILL BE DROPPED MY PROCTOR WRITES AN ARTICLE IN THE TELEGRAPH CALLING FOR LABOUR'S TOM WATSON TO APOLOGISE WHAT HE CALLS OUTLANDISH REMARKS ABOUT HIM ABOUT AN ALLEGED PAEDOPHILE RING AT WESTMINSTER HE ARGUES FOR ANONYMITY FOR THOSE SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED OF ABUSE AND SAYS YOU SHOULD BE MADE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE FOR POLICE TO LEAK THE DETAILS AND INVESTIGATIONS TO THE PRESS
THE TIMER SAYS WE ARE BEING BOMBARDED WITH MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION NUISANCE CALLS EVERY DAY AND THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING URGED TO TAKE NEW ACTION ABOUT IT SAYS OF REPORTERS FOUND THAT ATTEMPT OVER RECENT VIEWERS TO TIGHTEN THE RULES HAVE HAD LITTLE IMPACT AND AMBULANCE CHASING LAWYERS ARE STILL
DRIVING THE INDUSTRY THE AUTHOR BARRY HINES WHO'S DIED AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY SIX IS MARKED BY AN OBITUARY IN THE INDEPENDENT WHICH PRAISES HIS COMPASSION AND AUTHENTICITY HE WAS OF COURSE BEST KNOWN FOR THE NOVEL A KESTREL FOR A KNAVE ADAPTED TO THAT WONDERFUL FILM THE SIXTY NINE FILM COS THE FILM'S PRODUCER TONY GARNETT WRITES IN THE GUARDIAN THAT ALTHOUGH HINDS DESPISE PROFESSIONAL YORKSHIREMAN HE HAD THE CLASSIC QUALITIES OF HIS HOME COUNTY IN INDEPENDENCE IN HUMOUR IN CAN THEN
SHEER STUBBORNNESS THE TIME SAYS THAT ONCE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY HE REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED IT ONLY TO CONCLUDE THERE'S NOWT WORTH BLOODY WRITING ABOUT MY DAD WAS A YORKSHIREMAN SO THAT WAS A WEEK ATTEMPTED THAT ACTS ARE BETTER THAN SEMI AUTHENTIC GOOD CHORDS IT TO SEVEN DAVID CAMERON THE MAIN COURSE DAVID CAMERON
TRIED TO DEFEND HIS GOVERNMENT'S RECORD TODAY AFTER DAYS OF BITTER INFIGHTING SPARKED BY THE RESIGNATION I'LL BE IN DUNCAN SMITH CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFIT AT THE CENTRE OF THE ROW ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABANDONED
SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF THE WAR IN IRAQ HAVE BEEN TALK FOOTBALL BY ARSENAL THE CLUB HAS TEAMED UP WITH THE CHARITY SAVE THE CHILDREN TO BUILD PICTURES AT CAMPS FOR DISPLACED PEOPLE IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY A REPORTER CATRIN I TRAVELLED OUT TO A RAG WITH THE ARSENAL LADIES CAPTAIN ALEX SCOTT
PREENING AT ARSENAL ON THE PITCH IS LADIES' CAPTAIN AND ENGLAND PLAYER ALEX SCOTT VALLEY WAS PREPARING TO TAKE HER SKILLS FAR BEYOND THIS NORTH LONDON
ARSENAL'S NEW PITCHES IN A ROCK FOR ME GROWING UP IN THAT FOOTBALL CAVED IN THE EAST END OF LONDON THAT WAS WHEN I DREAMT OF PLAYING FOR ENGLAND AND PLAYING FOR ARSENAL USED PICTURE THAT FOOTBALL CAGE THAT WAS MY WEMBLEY FOOTBALL WITH IT JUST THE GAME YOU KNOW YOU CAN IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GO OVER AND MAKE THIS TRIP WITH SAVE THE CHILDREN ARSENAL HAVE BUILT TWO PITCHES FOR CHILDREN WHO FLED WAR
BOYS AND CRUCIALLY ALSO GIRLS I THINK AZIZ'S ARSENAL'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE QUITE APART FROM DELIVERING PLAYING
DISCIPLINE AND STRUCTURE IN THEIR LIVES WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THINGS BUT QUITE APART FROM THAT THERE'S A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT PARTICULARLY CHILL THAT THE PEOPLE
YOU IDOLISE THE SPORT THAT YOU WATCH CARES
COME ON NOW SO I'VE ARRIVED IN IRAQ THE CAMERA DRIVING THROUGH KURDISTAN IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY I DRIVE A PEST ONE IS DISTINCTIVE KURDISH MUSIC
NOW THIS IS RELATIVE SAFETY COMPARED TO THE REST OF IRAQ BUT WAS STILL JUST A FEW HOURS FROM THE FRONT LINE JUST A FEW HOURS FROM TERRITORY CONTROLLED BY ISIS SOME ON OUR WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO FLEE HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BEHIND BECAUSE OF THAT CONFLICT
AND I'M GONNA KILL YOU LADY COMES DOWN ANOTHER CATTLE CAN I COME IN
NO ESTHER OR HIS NAME YOU'VE CHANGED AS ONE OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND LIVING IN THIS CAMP CALLED AL LAND ONE AND JUST NEAR THE BORDER WITH IRAN
SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN MORE THAN THREE MILLION IRAQIS HAVE LEFT THEIR HOMES HALF HER CHILDREN
LES IS LOOKING FOR YOU IF YOU'RE AFRAID ASRAR TELLS ME THEY FLED FROM EXPLOSIONS AND BOMBS BUT THEY WERE SCARED THEY WOULD REACH
ARE THERE ANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE CAMP ABOUT LIVING HERE BUT I HAVE THE LETTER
I HAVE TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL AND THE FOOTBALL PITCH
THIS IS THAT IT TODAY WITH ALEX SCOTT AS AN EXTRA PLAYER ANY GUY YOU WANT
YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME YES SAY FOOTBALL THEN YEAH IT'S BETTER THE BOY HIS THE GIRL O.K.
BOYS ANGLES ARE LEARNING TO PLAY FOOTBALL HERE WHY DID YOU DECIDE TODAY THAT ALEX WOULD TEACH THE GIRLS FOR THE GIRLS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY COME FROM A VERY CONSERVATIVE FAMILY IS THOROUGH SIRE IS FROM SAVE THE CHILDREN IRAQ IT'S NOT REALLY IN THEIR CULTURAL NORMS THAT THEY WOULD BE ENGAGING IN SUCH ACTIVITIES AND SPORTS TO THEM SHE'S A BIG SOURCE OF INSPIRATION
THE FACT THAT SHE'S A WOMAN AND SHE'S MADE IT INTERNATIONALLY IT'S NOT COMMON TO HAVE A FEMALE FIGURE WHO WAS SUCH A GOOD LEADER AND I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF THE GIRLS YESTERDAY SHE WAS TELLING ME I LOOK FORWARD ON MY WAY WALKING SO THEY'RE FOR PUPPETS I LOOK FORWARD TO COMING HERE AND FORGETTING ALL MY PROBLEMS AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR
GRAB A WORD WITH ALEX SHE LEAVES THE CAMP SO I ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HOME AND TELL MY MAID
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER HAVE ANYWAY
THEY'RE JUST P. POINT BAD STUFF BUT I DON'T THINK WE PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO
REALLY GOOD IT'S JUST THAT WHAT BERNICE GOT LUCKY THAT SHE WAS BUT WHERE SHE WAS
WHERE THEY ARE BUT THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE AND THEY STILL DREAM THE SAME DREAM
SO I WAS CATRIN NO TALKING TO ALEX SCOTT LADIES CAPTAIN OF ARSENAL AND YOU CAN SEE MORE ON THAT STORY ON THE VICTORIA DERBYSHIRE PROGRAMME ON B.B.C. TWO AS WELL AS ON YOUTUBE IT IS NOW TEN TO SEVEN HIS FORMULA RACING FORMULA ONE RACING BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS AGAIN THE QUESTION'S BEEN RAISED BECAUSE OF THE HUGE CRASH AT THE OPENING RACE OF THE SEASON IN MELBOURNE YESTERDAY WHERE I'M JOINED BY THE FOUR FOR THE LOT ONE DRIVER AND COMMENTATOR MARK RUNDELL MARK
MORNING JOHN HE WAS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE FERNANDO ALONSO WASN'T HE HE WAS A LUCKY BOY I HAVE TO SAY AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THE STRENGTH THE CAR CAME THROUGH AND IT SHOWED THAT F. ONE IS STILL VERY SAFE IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT IN A FORMULA ONE IS DANGEROUS
YEAH THAT THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT BUT WE DID SEE DIDN'T WE WE HAVE SEEN BUT VERY SHARP DROP IN THE NUMBER OF FATAL ACCIDENTS OVER THE YEARS
I THINK STATISTICALLY IF YOU LOOKED OVER THE YEARS IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY SAFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK EVERYONE STRIVING FOR SAFETY THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE IT YEAR IN YEAR OUT BUT YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND HER RACING DRIVERS MADE UP YOU KNOW THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WANT A SANITISED CIRCUIT AND COMPLETE SAFETY THEY'RE IN AN AREA OF SPORT WHERE A RISK IS APPEALING THERE'S A CERTAIN
SORT OF BUILT IN SORT OF DEATH WISH TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THERE I SAY IT BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU IN THE CAR AND THE OTHER COMPETITORS AND TRYING TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT AND AT TIMES IT CAN BE DANGEROUS
IS IT MORE ABOUT THE CAR THAN A BOAT WHAT OF COURSE THE TWO GO TOGETHER AS YOU SAY BUT THE GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR SAFETY RECORD OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN TO DO WITH THE WAY THE CAR IS BUILT IS THAT RIGHT
YEAH I'M IN A LOT OF THE DESIGNER AS INCORPORATED AT HUGE AMOUNT OF OUR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS THAT'S BEEN THE CASE IN SEVERAL AREAS WITHIN OUR SPORT I THINK THE F.I.A. GOVERNING BODY ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS STRIVE TO IMPROVE SAFETY AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AS WELL AS THE CIRCUITRY CIRCUIT CHANGE OVER THE YEARS EVEN PLACES LIKE MONACO HEAVILY RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF ROOM THEY'VE GOT THEY'VE MANAGED TO FIND EXTRA RUN OFF AREA
BUT DON'T GET ME WRONG AT THE END OF IT ALL THERE'S A CERTAIN ELEMENT WHERE WE WE GO OUT THERE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE DO AS I SAY THERE'S OTHER SPORTS AS WELL WITH A DANGEROUS YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO THE BOXING RING
IF YOU DON'T PUNCH EACH OTHER THERE'S GOING TO BE NO DANGER INVOLVED AS WELL EXACTLY BUT ON FORMULA IN FORMULA ONE WHAT YOU TRYING TO DO IS AVOID THE OTHER CAR AND I DID IT I MEAN THAT'S THE BIG DIDN'T IT WELL THAT THAT'S THE CASE BUT IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE WEEKEND THINGS DO HAPPEN AND THAT'S PART AND PARCEL OF WHAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS THAT INCIDENT FOR EXAMPLE WAS CAUSED BY
ALONSO HEAVEN HE'S D. R. S. OPEN HIS REAR WING OPEN A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE OTHER CAR IN FRONT SO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME AS A SUMMER'S NOT THAT IT'S JUST THE REAR WING JOHN THERE'S A LITTLE SLOT GAP OPENS UP THAN ACTUALLY INCREASES THE STRAIGHT LINE SPEED OF THE CAR AND YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT IN CERTAIN ZONES ON THE CIRCUIT AROUND THE LAP ALONSO'S WAS OPEN GIVEN HIM A BIGGER TOP LINE SPEED GOOD HERE AS THE GUY IN FRONT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BRAKING ZONE AT THAT SAME POINT DIFFERENTIAL IN SPEED
A LITTLE BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING ON PLACING HERSELF ON A CIRCUIT ALONSO CLIP THE REAR OF HIS CAR AND THE REST IS HISTORY AS THEY SAY BUT UNFORTUNATE BUT HAPPENS ORATION INSTANT LUCKILY ALONSO SAFE IT IS INCREDIBLY TECHNICAL ISN'T IT
IT IS YOU KNOW THIS SOME VERY CLEVER PEOPLE IN FORMULA ONE AND DESIGN AND ENGINEERING SIDE AS WELL COMES OUT THE U.K. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE QUITE PROUD OF THAT WE LEAD THE WAY IN THAT SECTOR YOU NEVER THINK OH WOULDN'T IT BE GOOD TO GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN IT WAS JUST DOWN TO NEVER JUST DOWN TO DRIVER SCHOOL OBVIOUSLY THE CAR ALWAYS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT BUT WE'RE ALL THE CARS WERE MUCH THE SAME AND IT WAS DOWN TO THE DRIVER USING HIS STEERING WHEEL OF HIS BREAK AND HIS CLUTTER OR WHATEVER IT IS
I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT ONE I THINK A LOT OF RACING DRIVERS IN A PURIST FORM WOULD WANT THAT SO THEY CAN COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE PUREST WAY POSSIBLE BUT THOSE DAYS ARE PROBABLY ALLUDING TO ARE ALSO HIGH FOR TELL US HE RATES IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO WHEN WE LOOKED AND EVERY GRAND PRIX THERE WAS SOMEBODY LOST SO THERE'S A BALANCE AS ALWAYS IN LIFE MARK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED TIME NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THIRTEEN
FAMILIAR SOUND A NEWTON UNFAMILIAR ONE IT'S THE STONES OF COURSE BUT IT'S AN UNRELEASED TRACK NO ONE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ME AND IT WAS FOUND IN THE ATTIC OF A HOUSE IN TORQUAY FIFTY YEARS AFTER IT WAS RECORDED THE MAN WHO FOUND IT IS JEREMY NIELSEN WHO JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM EXETER MORNING TO YOU JEREMY GOOD MORNING YOU HAD IT FOR YEARS BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW

IS A BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JAWLINE
THE C.B.I. COMMISSION THE CONSULTANT'S P.W.C. TO ASSESS HOW THE ECONOMY WOULD REACT UNDER TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOLLOWING A SO CALLED REX IT BRITAIN STRIKES IF FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. AND THE E.U. BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR GOODS BUT FAILS TO GET FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE OTHER SCENARIO ASSUMES THAT BRITAIN WOULD DEFAULT BACK TO WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION RULES WITH LIMITED TARIFFS
THE C.B.I. SAYS THAT IN THE FOUR YEARS AFTER HER VOTE TO LEAVE UP TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS COULD BE LOST IT ADDS THAT EVEN IN THE BEST CASE BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. YOU WOULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE U.K. ECONOMY THE VOTE LEAVE GROUP SAID THAT BOTH P.W.C. AND THE C.B.I. HAD ADVOCATED BRITAIN JOINING THE EURO IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE P.W.C. HIS OWN ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THREE MILLION JOBS WOULD BE CREATED BY TWENTY THIRTY AFTER BRITAIN HAD LEFT THE E.U.
THE BODY THAT MONITORS SOCIAL MOBILITY HAS SAID APPRENTICESHIPS IN ENGLAND AREN'T DELIVERING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THE SOCIAL MOBILITY AND CHILD POVERTY COMMISSION SAID YOUTH APPRENTICESHIPS IN ENGLAND HAD FLATLINED SINCE TWENTY TEN AND SUCCESS RATES WERE DECLINING THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS COMMITTED TO DRIVING UP QUALITY AND SAID THE COURSES GIVE SCHOOL LEAVERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN THE SKILLS THEY NEEDED HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE COMMISSION WELCOMED THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF APPRENTICESHIPS AND SAID THAT FOR TOO LONG THE VOCATIONAL ROUTE TO QUALIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN SEEN AS AN OPTION FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN BUT HE'D SAID PEOPLE OVER TWENTY FIVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE RECENT GROWTH IN APPRENTICESHIPS THE NUMBER YOUNGER THAN THAT HAD INCREASED BY ONLY FOUR PER CENT DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS
IT SAID THE RATE OF APPRENTICESHIPS THAT WERE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WAS DECLINING FOR ALL GROUPS AND IN THE CASE OF STUDENTS ON TO TWENTY FOUR TO LESS THAN THREE QUARTERS
THE COMMISSION SAID MANY YOUTH APPRENTICESHIPS WERE IN JOBS WITH INFERIOR PAY AND PROSPECTS SUCH AS HAIRDRESSING CHILDREN'S CARE AND IN SHOPS
SERENA WILLIAMS HAS DISMISSED AS OFFENSIVE REMARKS MADE BY THE ORGANISER OF THE U.S. TOURNAMENT WHO SAID WOMEN'S TENNIS WAS RIDING ON THE COAT TAILS OF THE MEN'S GAME RAYMOND MOORE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE INDIAN WELLS COMPETITION SAID LADY PLAYERS SHOULD GET ON THEIR KNEES AND THANK ROGER FEDERER AND I ON THE DHOW FOR CARRYING THE SPORT WILLIAMS WASN'T IMPRESSED I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES
IN ANY ANYBODY LIKE THAT I THINK I THINK THOSE REMARKS
VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND VERY VERY VERY INACCURATE NOVAK DJOKOVIC FRESH FROM WINNING THE TOURNAMENT FOR A RECORD FIFTH TIME DEFENDED THE WOMEN'S GAME BUT HE SAID MEN SHOULD BE PAID MORE OUR MEN STENNIS WORLD THE EIGHTY FOR YOU SHOULD FIGHT FOR MORE BECAUSE THE SETS THAT'S A SHOWING THAT WE HAVE
SPECTATORS ON THE MEN'S TENNIS MATCHES AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE MAYBE WE SHOULD GET AWARDED MORE
THAT DJOKOVIC THANK YOU SUSAN IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE CHARGES LAID AGAINST THIS CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT COULD SCARCELY BE MORE SERIOUS IT IS DIVIDING THE COUNTRY BY CHOOSING TO TAKE MONEY FROM THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT TO GIVE TO THOSE WHO CARE WHY BECAUSE THE LOSERS DON'T VOTE TORY WHEREAS THE GAINERS DO THOSE CHARGES REMEMBER HAVE BEEN LAID BY A FORMER LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE MAN IN CHARGE OR WELFARE POLICY FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS IAN DUNCAN SMITH
AND IT IS LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS IN THE CAR SINCE THE CONSERVATIVES WON AN ELECTION ON A PROMISE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL WELFARE CUTS TO PAY FOR CUTS IN THE DEFICIT SO DID THEY PROMISE SOMETHING THEY'VE NO LONG WE'VE GOT THE STOMACH TO DELIVER IN A MOMENT WE'LL HEAR FROM ONE BACKBENCH CRITIC ON THE RECORD FIRST THOUGH OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS IS A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS
OFF THE RECORD SO WHAT DO THEY SAY ROSS AND MANY OF THEM FEEL THAT THEIR WESTMINSTER AS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE CHAUFFEUR A WEEKEND THAT IT THE POWER AND THE DISCIPLINE BASES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAVE SHIFTED ONE SAID THE DAM HAS BURST ON GEORGE OSBORNE BUT HIS AUTHORITY IS SEEPING AWAY AND IT REALLY IS A VERY SIMPLE ISSUE THEY NO LONGER
I'LL CONVINCE HE'S GOING TO WIN THE LEADERSHIP SOME OF THEM ARE NO LONGER CONVINCED HE'S GOING TO BE CHANCE THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME AT ONE END HE SAID IF THERE WAS A SHORT TERM CONTEST THERE WOULD BE A GENOCIDE OF THE CAMEROON'S IN THE OSBORNE NIGHTS A MINISTER SAID TO ME LABOUR VOTED FOR GORDON BROWN IN FEAR WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF GEORGE OSBORNE WHY DOES THIS MATTER IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT GEORGE OSBORNE'S CAREER PROSPECTS IT MATTERS BECAUSE THIS IS A PARTY THAT PLEDGE WELFARE CUTS IN THEIR MANIFESTOS YOU MENTIONED IT PLACE IT WOULD STICK
WELFARE CAP AS WELL AND NOW THEY FACE A COALITION IN EFFECT WITHIN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OR VOTES THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITION THEY HAVE CENTURIES SOCIALLY LIBERAL CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AND THEY HAVE EURGH SKETCHES AND I THINK WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT OPPOSITION CAN EITHER WIN VOTES ON THE FLOOR OR PROVE IT CAN WIN VOTES IN ADVANCE AND I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE TESTED ON TUESDAY THERE ARE TWO
REBEL AMENDMENTS DOWN THAT RELATE TO THE BUDGET ESSENTIALLY ARGUING ABOUT THE RIGHT OF BRITAIN TO BE ABLE TO SET ITS OWN V.A.T. RATES WOULD DISREGARDING WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TO SAY ON TWO POINTS HOME INSULATION AND SANITARY PRODUCTS PLENTY OF TORIES INTEND TO SUPPORT THOSE
AND WE'RE IN A PLACE NOW FOR AS LONG AS GEORGE OSBORNE IS THE CHANCER AS LONG AS DAVID CAMERON IS THE LEADER PLENTY OF THEIR M.P.S BELIEVE THIS IS A GOVERNMENT FRANKLY WITH A MALLEABLE MIND ONE THAT CAN BE CHANGED ONE M. P. SAID IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN SEASON ON STANDING UP TO SOME OF THE THINGS OSBORNE IS TRYING TO DO
TALKING TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEY WERE LISTENING TO THAT IS SARAH AT WALLASTON CONSERVATIVE M.P. OF COURSE AND CHAIR OF THE HEALTH SELECT COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THE CHARGES LAID BY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS IT GEORGE OSBORNE GUILTY AS CHARGED OR THEY ARE VERY SERIOUS CHARGES AND TODAY WHEN DAVID CAMERON STANDS UP HE HAS TO REAFFIRM THAT MESSAGE THAT LED MANY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO JOIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN HE TOOK OVER AS LEADER ARE WE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE
ARE WE ABOUT SPREADING THE BURDEN FAIRLY AND WE NEED TO HEAR THAT A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE TODAY MOVING FORWARD SO LET'S BE CLEAR ON YOUR VIEW AT THE MOMENT YOU BELIEVE IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS RIGHT THIS PARTY IS PURSUING DIVISIVE POLICIES THAT TAKE FROM THOSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT AND GIVE IT TO THOSE WHO CAN THE POINT IS PEOPLE JUDGE US ON OUR ACTIONS NOT JUST OUR WORDS AND IF IN THE SAME BUDGET YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO LINK A REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAPE PAYMENTS AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'RE CUTTING TAXES FOR THE WEALTHIEST I'M AFRAID
THAT ISN'T THE MESSAGE THAT ISN'T CONSISTENT AND WE NEED THAT MESSAGE TO BE CONSISTENT AS WELL SO ARE YOU READY TO USE YOUR VOTE TO BACK UP WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN OTHER WORDS TO VOTE WITH THE LABOUR PARTY AGAINST YOUR OWN PARTIES BUDGET EVEN IF THEIR WRISTS AS IT UNDOUBTEDLY WOULD THE DEFEAT OF THE GUM
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL IT WILL COME TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK TODAY WE'LL HEAR A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT ANTHONY'S P. I P.
PAYMENT PLANS CHANGES ARE ALL RIGHT BING BING BING SHELVED BUT THEN I DO NOT ANYWAY THAT WAS DUE TO PAY FOR THAT CUT STILL ON THEIR BUDGET IT'S GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE SO DO YOU NEED TO DEFEAT THAT AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PLANNED OVER PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE BUT IT WAS I MAY NEED TO BE A SIGNAL THAT HE'S GOING TO COME BACK AND REVISE SOME OF THESE PLANS AND REVISED THE BALANCE OF WHERE THE BURDEN FALLS FOR BALANCING THE BOOKS
SO I HOPE THAT'S THE SIGNAL WE'RE HERE TODAY WHEN HE'S PRESENTED A BUDGET DO YOU SUGGEST HE SHOULD COME BACK IN IN EFFECT PRESENTER SECOND BUDGET WE'RE NOT AN ENTIRE WHOLE BUDGET BUT CERTAINLY ACTUALLY SET OUT HELD THIS BURDEN IS GOING TO BE SHARED AND WE NEED THAT VERY CLEAR MESSAGE BECAUSE AS I SAY MANY PEOPLE JOINED THE CONSERVATIVES PUT THEIR TRUST IN DAVID CAMERON BECAUSE THAT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE HEARING WAS THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE YES WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THE BOOKS I JUST WANNA BE AWAY YOU MEAN THAT THAT BILLION POUND IT'S ONE POINT THREE BILLION TO BE PRECISE
SHOULD NO LONGER BE ON THE BOOKS OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD PAY FOR THAT CUT I THINK THE POINT THAT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WAS MAKING WAS THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS THE MOMENT THAT THAT CAN'T BE TOUCHED IF YOU LIKE AND THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INTER GENERATIONAL FAIRNESS AS WELL THAT MIGHT MEAN LOOKING AT WHERE THAT SHOULD FALL AND THAT THE WEALTHIEST PENSIONERS FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF THEM IN MY CONSTITUENCY TOLD ME THAT ACTUALLY THEY TOO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY
THAT THESE THAT THE CUTS ARE FALLING AND THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUNGER PEOPLE SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE AS MUCH RESISTANCE TO THAT AS AS PERHAPS PEOPLE IMAGINE BECAUSE INTER GENERATIONAL FAIRNESS MATTERS TO OLDER PEOPLE AS WELL AND TIPPED A WEALTHIER OLDER PENSIONERS HERE FOR A BIT OF HAVE THE PROM WHEN THIS IS ALL REAL WE SARAH WITH US AND AS YOU'VE ONLY JUST ROMFORD ELECTION YOU'VE JUST BEEN CHOSEN BY THE ELECTORATE ON A MANIFESTO THAT SAID ONE
PROTECT PENSIONERS TO CUT WELFARE BY TWELVE BILLION POUNDS THREE CUT THE DEFICIT IN LESS THAN A YEAR YOU AND IAIN DUNCAN SMITH COMING BACK AND SAYING WELL LOOK I'M TERRIBLY SORRY HE SAID ALL OF THESE THINGS WE NO LONGER BELIEVE IN CARRYING ANY OF THEM OUT
NO I THINK THAT THE POINT IS THAT WHEN THOSE THAT THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE CUTS TO BENEFITS IT WASN'T SPECIFIED EXACTLY WHERE THEY WOULD FALL BUT IT WAS MADE VERY VERY CLEAR THAT THEY WOULDN'T FALL AND PENSIONERS THEY MINISTERS ROSS THAT ON THIS PROGRAMME AND ELSEWHERE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN I KNOW BUT AS I SAY IN A BUDGET WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TAKING SOMETHING A SENSITIVE AS PERSONAL INDEPENDENCE PAYMENT WHERE SOME INDIVIDUALS COULD FACE LOSING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU'RE GIVING BACK TAX CUTS ELSEWHERE SO IT'S ABOUT WHERE THE BURDEN OF THAT SHOULD FALL CAN YOU SEE ONE LONG TORIES ARE SHOUTING AT THE RADIO AT THE MOMENT SAYING YOU RAN FOR ELECTION ON A POPULIST PROMISE TO CUT WELFARE IN A WAY THAT YOU FRANKLY HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING AND NOW ARE TRYING TO REVERSE IT AND YOU WANT CREDIT FOR BEING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING IT
NO I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE SHOUTING AT THE RADIO IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REALLY REALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO TO PERSONAL INDEPENDENT PAYMENTS AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE GIVING OUT TAX CUTS AND CHANGES TO CAPITAL GAINS TAX SO I THINK THAT THERE WAS A SENSE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET THAT THIS DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT
AND WE NEED TO HAVE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE AT THE CLEAR MESSAGE THAT DAVID CAMERON WAS GIVING OUT BUT I THINK HE SHOULD REAFFIRM TODAY WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING THIS A FAIR DISTRIBUTION YES BALANCING THE BOOKS YES THAT WE'VE STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO TO DO THAT BUT LET'S JUST LOOK AT WHERE THAT BURDEN FALLS SORRY WELL IS IMPORTANT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THANK YOU SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LASER QUEST A LEADERS BORN OR MADE WHAT I SUPPOSE MADE AS WELL AS BORN PERHAPS AS THE ODDS FOR THAT ADAM BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BUSINESS AND FINANCE REPORT OUT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
MAKING AS IT WERE LEADERS IT IS IT'S ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE AND CREATING LEADERS THIS IS THAT THE CHURCHILL TWENTY FIRST LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME THE NAME CHURCHILL WILL GIVE YOU A CLUE AS TO WHERE IT IS COMING FROM THIS IS THE OUTLOOK OF A PANEL CHAIRED BY HARRY GREEN THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THOMAS COOK NOW I.B.M.'S GLOBAL HEAD OF WHAT AN INTERNET OF THINGS COMMERCE AND EDUCATION
GOOD MORNING TO YOU HAD A GREAT MORNING THE NAME CHURCHILL WINSTON CHURCHILL IN THE HEAD OF YOUR LEADERSHIP PROGRAMME IN THIS REPORT THAT YOU HAVE PRODUCED TODAY WHAT INSPIRES YOU FROM WINSTON CHURCHILL WHAT DOES HE TELL US ABOUT TODAY'S LEADERSHIP
I THINK THAT WE USED HIM AT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH TO SORT OF REALLY DIVE DEEPLY INTO ALL ELEMENTS OF LEADERSHIP AND THE REPORT CAME OUT WITH SORT OF FIVE THINGS THREE I'LL MAYBE MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE FIRST IS THE WILL AND DESIRE TO ACTUALLY LEAD TO TAKE ON REALLY BIG STUFF SECONDLY
THE WILL TO LEARN THIS CONSTANT REINVENTION LEARNING NEWS STAFF BEING ABLE TO FLOURISH IN A MASSIVELY CHANGING WORLD AND THIRDLY BALANCING THE HERE AND NOW WITH THE SLIGHTLY LONGER TERM
THERE WERE ALSO BIG SECTIONS AROUND COMMUNICATING VISION AND UNDERSTANDING CONNECTING IN A MORE CLUMP COMPLEX WORLD BUT THE GOAL WAS TO ACQUIT PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND BECOME BETTER LEADERS SO HE'S A GREAT LEADER
A GREAT ORATOR OR SOMEBODY WITH WITH DEEP THOUGHTS WHO DO BETTER SOMEBODY WHO THINKS DEEPLY BUT HE'S NOT A GREAT COMMUNICATOR OR VICE VERSA I THINK IT DEPENDS WHAT LEADERSHIP ROLE YOU'RE EMBRACING IF IT IS BUSINESS LEADERSHIP YOU HAVE SO MANY STAKE HOLDERS SO MANY COMMUNITIES INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY
BEING ABLE TO CONVEY WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS CLEARLY KEY HAVING A GOOD STRATEGY THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE IS IMPORTANT HAVING A BRILLIANT STRATEGY THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO DIFFERENTLY TOMORROW IT IS UNLIKELY TO WORK SO IT DEPENDS ON THEIR ROLE IN LEADERSHIP THAT YOU'RE TAKING
YOU HAVE JOINED I.B.M. YOU HAVE THIS THIS VERY IMPRESSIVE JOBS AT TIED LIKE GLOBAL HEAD OFF BUT WHAT AN INTERNET OF THINGS NO WATSON IS THIS COMPLEX PROGRAMME THAT I.B.M. HAS DEVELOPED WITH THIS ALGORITHM THAT EFFECTIVELY INGEST A VAST AMOUNT OF DATA AND COMES TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT IT THERE WILL BE THOSE HOW IT YOU WERE A BIT WORRIED ABOUT THIS THEY'LL SEE IT AS BEING A BIT LIKE THAT FILM TWO THOUSAND ONE WHERE THE COMPUTER STARTS RUNNING EVERYTHING
SO SO WATSON IS A COGNITIVE COMPUTING SYSTEM SO IT IS ABLE TO PROCESS A MASS OF STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED DATA ARE ABLE TO REASON TO DIFFERENT LEVELS AND TO PRODUCE THEMES PATTERNS CORRELATIONS AND COMMUNICATE IN HUMAN LANGUAGE SO
YES THERE ARE THOSE THAT MAY BE CONCERNED BUT FOR OTHERS NOT KNOWING IS THE GRADER CONCERNED THAT IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN COLLEGE E. FASTER THEN MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE A SERIOUS CANCERS SO WE SEE THIS AS A WAY OF OF OF OF REALLY DIVING INTO THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS TO DO ESSENTIAL WORK MUST MUSCLE YOUR YOUR TIMER THOMAS COOK DID AND UNDER
CLOUD WITH HER DEBTS OF TWO CHILDREN CRUSH ON ROBERT SHEPHERD DIED FROM CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE YOU TOOK OVER AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE THEY WERE CRITICISM THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THE COMPANY WAS TOO SLOW TO APOLOGISE WHAT ARE YOUR REFLECTIONS
SO I THINK THERE ARE THREE REFLECTIONS THE FIRST IS A REINFORCEMENT OF HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO MAKE THOMAS COOK WELL SO THAT IT WAS ABLE TO EXCEPT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO SUPPORT ITS EMPLOYEES ITS MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS ARE AND STAKE HOLDER SO MAKING IT WHILE WAS IMPORTANT I THINK
LISTENING MORE EVEN CHURCHILL AS A GREAT ORATOR THIS ABILITY TO REALLY LISTEN AND TO UNDERSTAND WITH COMPASSION CLEARLY A GREAT AND IMPORTANT LEARNING AND THEN THIRDLY CREATING POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS THE SAFER TOURISM FUND SO NO OTHER CHILDREN OR FAMILY HAVE TO SUFFER THAT TERRIBLE FATE
HURRY CRIMINALLY THANK YOU GENERAL MANAGER GLOBAL HEAD I SHOULD SAY FOR ORGANS WHAT'S AN INTERNET OF THINGS COMMERCE AND EDUCATION THANK YOU ADAM IT'S SEVEN TWENTY ONE NOW YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A BRITISH BUSINESSMAN WHO RISK YEARS IN PRISON IN DUBAI FOR ALLEGEDLY SENDING AN OFFENSIVE TWEET ABOUT HIS BUSINESS PART OF THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LEEDS UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB A MAN CALLED DAVID HAIG WELL THE VERDICT IS OUT
THE BELL IS FOLLOWING THE STORY IS BACK WITH US AND WELL AS LOCAL LAWYER JUST CALLED ME FROM DUBAI WITH THE ONE WORD ACQUITTED HE SAID WHICH WAS A HUGE SURPRISE TO HIM AND DAVID HE HASN'T ACTUALLY TOLD DAVID AGED YET BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SEPARATE BUILDING SO HE'S GOING OVER TO GIVE HIM THE NEWS NOW I HAD A QUICK WORD WITH DAVID HAIG SPOKESMAN IN THE U.K. WHO SAID AFTER A TWENTY TWO MONTH NIGHTMARE THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE EXPECTED AFTER VOLUNTARILY FLYING TO DUBAI THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED
EXPECTS HIM BACK IN THE U.K. AFTER AROUND TWO TO THREE DAYS SO THE SUGGESTION WAS THOUGH THAT THIS WAS USED UP IT ALMOST A TRUMPED UP CHARGE AND HE WAS LIKELY TO FIND HIMSELF IN PRISON FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT NOT TO BE THE CASE ABSOLUTELY JUST TO CONSIDER THESE SIX OR SEVEN TWEETS IT TOOK THEM FOUR MONTHS AND EACH TIME HAD DAVID HAIG WENT BACK ABOUT SIX TIMES THEY KEPT SAYING THAT THEY WERE TRANSLATING THE TWEETS AND IT WAS TAKING A WHILE PERHAPS THE PRESSURE FROM HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH HELPED PERHAPS THE FOREIGN OFFICE WERE DOING THINGS IN THE BACKGROUND WE CAN'T TELL BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING HAS CHANGED
HE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT WAS IN THERE TO EAT COS I WAS LEGALLY SENDS HIM PROBABLY HORRIBLY COMPLICATED AS WELL BUT ROUGHLY THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS BASICALLY DAVID TAKE TEAM HERE WERE SAYING THAT HE WAS A PIECE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT THEY WAS FORM SHOPPING HIT THAT HE HAD BEEN DRAWN INTO ANOTHER JURISDICTION IN ORDER FOR THE CHARGES TO BE AND HEARD THERE OF COURSE GEOFF H. CAPITAL DENY THAT THAT WAS THEIR PLAN BUT A SEQUENCE OF EVENT WAS THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS HAVE HIM FLYING THERE AND SUDDENLY BEING ARRESTED AS HE LANDED THERE WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR BRINGING UP TODAY
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN USUAL BUT WHY NOT ROB SPORT THEY SHONE YES GOOD MORNING TO YOU WELL TENNIS IS FACING MORE CONTROVERSY THIS MORNING THIS TIME IN THE LONG RUNNING DEBATE ABOUT PARITY BETWEEN THE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S GAME IT'S BEEN PROMPTED BY COMMENTS FROM RAIGMORE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE B.N.P. PARIS BAD EVENT AT INDIAN WELLS CALIFORNIA AT SPEAKING BEFORE YESTERDAY'S FINALS HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE THINKS THE WOMEN OWED THEIR SUCCESS TO THE MEN
RIGHT IN THAT ON ANY DECISION THOUGH LOVE
EVERY EVERY NIGHT ON MY KNEES AND THANK GOD
BECAUSE THEY RIDE ON THE COAT TAILS OF THE MEN THEY SHOULD GO DOWN ON THEIR KNEES AND THANK GOD FOR FEDERER AND THE DOUBT A CORRESPONDENT RUSSELL FULLER IS ON THE LINE FROM CALIFORNIA RUSSELL THESE ARE TRULY INCENDIARY COMMENTS AREN'T THEY AND OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN A REACTION
THEY ARE ASTONISHING COMMENTS FROM SOMEBODY IN SUCH A SENIOR POSITION BILLIE JEAN KING SHE'S DISAPPOINTED IN ROMAN MOORE'S COMMENTS HE IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS SHE SAID AND SERENA WILLIAMS WHO LOST THE FINAL TO VICTORIA AS A RANK OR AN INDIAN WELLS LAST NIGHT SAID IT'S A DISSERVICE TO BILLIE JEAN KING AND EVERY WOMAN ON THIS PLANET THAT HAS EVER TRIED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN SHE POINTED OUT THE LAST YEAR'S U.S. OPEN FINAL WHERE SHE WAS LIKELY TO BE GOING FOR A CALENDAR GRAND SLAM SOLD OUT BEFORE THE MEN'S FINAL AND SHE WAS SCATHING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT MORE USED
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO INTERPRET THERE GET ON YOUR KNEES WHICH IS OFFENSIVE AS A NUFF WE AS WOMEN HAVE COME A LONG WAY AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DROP TO KNEES ANY POINT AND MEANWHILE RUSSELL THE VAC DJOKOVIC HAS HAD HIS SAY
YES HE WAS LESS CONDEMNATORY BUT HE SAID QUITE CLEARLY THESE COMMENTS WERE NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT AND I THOUGHT HE WAS WALKING QUITE A TIGHTROPE WHEN HE MADE THESE COMMENTS
I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR ONE WOMAN GLOBAL SPORT ARE DOING IN THE ACHIEVING GNAWING
WHAT THEY ARE HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THEIR BODIES AND THEIR BODIES ARE MUCH DIFFERENT MEN MEN'S BODIES IN THERE I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HORMONES AND DIFFERENCE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO DETAILS TO THE RUSSELLS GUEST AS WELL
HE ALSO MADE THE ARGUMENT ROB THAT WOMEN DESERVED EVERY SINGLE PENNY THEY GET AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT MEN CURRENTLY MORE IN PRIZE MONEY BECAUSE MEN'S MATCHES HAVE MUCH HIGHER VIEWING FIGURES WERE RUSSELL I SUPPOSE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ISN'T A THAT SAYS THAT MUCH OF THIS DEBATE WOULD GO AWAY IF WOMEN ACTUALLY PLAYED FIVE SETS INSTEAD OF THREE
WELL I KNOW IT'S A VIEW THAT IS ADVANCED BY MANY WOMEN HAVE OFFERED TO PLAY FIVE SETS AND THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY POPULAR AND THAT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE SPORT IS LOOKING FOR SHORTER FORMS OF THE GAME ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SPORTS TO CAPTURE THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AUDIENCE PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PARTICULARLY VALID ARGUMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOMEN ARE
PLAYING AS MUCH AS THE WORLD IS ASKING THEM TO PLAY BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT IT'S A COMMON VIEW IN THE MEN'S GAME THE ONE THAT NOVAK DJOKOVIC ADVANCE THERE THAT MEN SHOULD BE PAID MORE BECAUSE THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT MEN'S MATCH IS CURRENTLY A MUCH MORE POPULAR THAN WOMEN'S

THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS LAUNDERS TO MEET RELATIVES OF THOSE KILLED IN THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST NOVEMBER FOLLOWING THE ARREST OF A KEY SUSPECT MY ALONE JUST SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE NETWORK BEHIND THE ATTACKS WAS MUCH LARGER THAN ORIGINALLY SUSPECTED
THE BUSINESS GROUP THE C.B.I. SAYS A NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT LEAVING THE Y. YOU COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY AND LEAD TO THE LOSS OF NEARLY A MILLION JOBS BY TWENTY TWENTY THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED THE CONCLUSIONS SAYING THAT BOTH THE ECONOMY AND EMPLOYMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW OUTSIDE THE E.U.
IT IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT THE NUMBER OF CASES OF MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER ROSE LAST YEAR UP BY FOURTEEN PERCENT IN ENGLAND AND WALES FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED NUMBERS ARE STILL RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO A DECADE AGO BUT HER RISE NONETHELESS WHEN THE FIGURES WERE RELEASED IN JANUARY THERE WAS SOME COMMENTARY SUGGESTING THAT PART OF THE RISE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOMETHING NEW FOR THE POLICE DEAL WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OFTEN FUELLED BY ALCOHOL IN HOUSES PACKED WITH MIGRANT WORKERS SO IS THIS A REAL PROBLEM IS THIS THE ANSWER TOM BATEMAN REPORTS STARTING IN BOSTON IN LINCOLNSHIRE
ABOUT A TEN MINUTE WALK FROM BOSTON TOWN CENTRE IS A LITTLE SQUARE OF HOUSES
THERE'S A CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND IN THE CENTRE AND IT WAS IN ONE OF THE HOUSES HERE IN MAY LAST YEAR THAT A GROUP OF EASTERN EUROPEAN MEN HAD BEEN LIVING AND A FIGHT BROKE OUT
THE INJURIES FOR ONE OF THE MEN TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD YARNS FOR LORD COE LED TO HIS DEATH
I'M AT THE LINE A NEW HAD NEIGHBOURS IN PASSING INCLUDED FELLOW LITHUANIANS SHE GOT A VIVID INSIGHT INTO LIFE NEXT DOOR
IN THEIR PEOPLE LIVES DEFEND PEOPLE YOU'VE SET UP THE EDGE JINGO VEDERE A LOTS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT PUT US
YOUR PUPIL WHAT A PICKING FLOWERS SOME PEOPLE IN FACT I DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF YOU WHAT DID YOU THINK WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HEARD THAT SOMEONE HAD DIED THAT EVERYTHING TO ALCOHOL
IT DIDN'T DO MUCH THE DAY HE HAD A LOT OF ACCIDENTS WHAT KINDS OF THINGS
DINK YOUNG FIRE DOING VIOLENT
YEAH THE ROCKS ALL OLDER TIME PROBLEMS THE CASE INVOLVING LIME HIS NEIGHBOUR COLLAPSED WHEN A JUDGE RULED THE SUSPECT COULD HAVE ACTED IN SELF DEFENCE HE CAME DURING THE RISE IN VIOLENCE WITHIN BOSTON'S MIGRANT COMMUNITY LAST YEAR TWO LITHUANIAN MEN DIED IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS A POLISH MAN SURVIVED BEING SHOT
ALL THIS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN A MARKET TOWN AND SAY THE POLICE SOUGHT TO REASSURE LOCALS THESE WORD DOMESTIC NOT A RANDOM ATTACKS AND THEY WERE THE EXCEPTION THEY SAID BUT WAS ALL THIS MISSING THE POINT DAVID WILSON IS A PROFESSOR OF CRIMINOLOGY AT BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIVERSITY
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS THAT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE ENGLISH GET DRUNK AND FIGHT AND OFTEN THOSE FIGHTS WILL TAKE PLACE IN PUBS OR WAITING IN TAXI QUEUES
BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN IN THE OPEN THAT SERVES TO DE ESCALATE THE VIOLENCE WHAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON ANECDOTALLY AMONGST IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES FROM EASTERN EUROPE THESE ARE ALSO YOUNG MEN WHO ARE GETTING DRUNK BUT WE'RE GETTING DRUNK AND MULTI OCCUPIED ACCOMMODATION AND THEREFORE THOSE FACTORS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY DE ESCALATE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE IS HAPPENING PUBLICLY JUST SIMPLY DON'T EXIST
IT IS ON HOT I'M CHIEF INSPECTOR MARK GARTHWAITE AND I AM THE VICTIM AND WITNESS LEAD FOR LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE MIGRANTS THAT COME TO LIVE HERE TO WORK HERE CAN THEY FEEL AS SAFE AS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LIVED IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME
YES THE CUP AND WERE VERY FORTUNATE LINCOLNSHIRE IS A PARTICULARLY SAFE COUNTY I AM GLAD THAT IN LINCOLNSHIRE IT BECOMES ABNORMAL WHEN WE DO HAVE A STABBING AND SHOOTING STRANGLING BECAUSE THAT SHOW WAS HOW NORMALLY SAFE WE ARE YES WE HAD A SMALL GROUP ALL GATHER TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME AUSTRIA WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT SINCE
ELSEWHERE IN EAST LONDON LAST YEAR AT A TERRACED HOUSE IN WHICH TEN MEN WERE LIVING JET WASH RE DIED HE'D BEEN BEATEN BY A FELLOW POLISH TENANT HAD BEEN DRINKING HEAVILY PREPARE HAD EARLIER QUARRELLED ABOUT FOOD IN THE HOUSE
TRYING TO TRACE WHERE THE MIGRANT WORKERS ARE AT GREATER RISK OF VIOLENCE IS CHALLENGING THE HOME OFFICE DOESN'T RECORD NATIONALITIES IN ITS HOMICIDE DATA BUT A TRAWL OF POLICE APPEALS AND COURT REPORTS SUGGEST THAT SINCE THE START OF TWENTY FOURTEEN IN ENGLAND AND WALES AT LEAST THIRTY TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CASES IN WHICH BOTH VICTIM AND SUSPECT WERE FROM EASTERN EUROPE THESE INVOLVED ALL SORTS OF CASES BUT SOME THEMES EMERGE
MIGRANTS WHO BECAME HOMELESS BEING BEATEN OR ROBBED AND UP TO A DOZEN CASES INVOLVING A DISPUTE WHICH ESCALATED OFTEN INVOLVING ALCOHOL USUALLY IN OR AROUND THE HOUSE AND MADE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED HOMICIDE CASES LAST YEAR THEIR NUMBERS DON'T PRESENT ANY PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL TRENDS
BUT THERE ARE SOME STRIKING OBSERVATIONS AT LEAST NINE LITHUANIANS WERE KILLED IN ENGLAND AND WALES LAST YEAR A NOTABLE FIGURE FOR A NATIONALITY THAT MAKES UP JUST POINT THREE PER CENT OF THE POPULATION
OTHER PETRUS THIRTY ON THIS I AM A LITHUANIAN ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST CHAPLIN OFF LITHUANIANS HAD CAST
THE LITHUANIAN MUSIC WELCOMES YOU HERE AT THE EAST LONDON CHURCH WHICH HAD BECOME SOMETHING OF A REFUGE FOR ONE MAN AMONG THAT NUMBER THIS PERSON
TO OUR CHAIR WHICH USED TO COME TO OUR CHURCH AS THAT I CALL THERE ARE PLENTY OF ANOTHER POLITICS AND NUMEROUS GROUP AND THEN HE DROPPED OUT AND HE BECAME HOMELESS
AND THEN IN THE MONTHS AFTER WAS WAS KILLED WHEN YOU HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND

TOM BATEMAN REPORTING IT'S NOW A TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS TORIES PLUNGE INTO OPEN WARFARE IS HOW THE GUARDIAN SUMS UP WHAT IT CALLS A DRAMATIC AND ASTONISHING WEEKEND A POLITICAL ARGUMENT IT SAYS BACKBENCHERS HAVE LINED UP TO SUPPORT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AFTER HE RESIGNED OVER CUTS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS AND CRITICISED HIS OWN PARTY'S LEADERSHIP THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS THE FALL OUT FROM HIS RESIGNATION AND SPIRALLED INTO A WIDER RAT
ABOUT THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE CHANCELLOR'S STYLE OF GOVERNMENT FOR THE DAILY MAIL THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN ENGULFED BY CIVIL WAR THE SUN OFFERS AND A STRAW IT PARALLEL POSSIBLY HELPFUL GRASSY GIVE DEPICTS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AS A ROUND HEAD BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT HAS STRONG RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND MAN EXTREMELY ROUND HEAD GEORGE OSBORNE AND DAVID CAMERON
WITH FLOWING LOCKS AS THE CAVALIERS THEY ACCUSED OF BELIEVING THEY HAVE A DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE AND THE CAVALIER DAVID CAMERON SAYS WE MUSTN'T LOSE OUR HEADS OVER THIS IN THE GRASS IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH LEADS WITH MISTER CAMERON'S PLANS
TO FIGHT BACK TO TRY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF HIS PARTY BY DEFENDING HIS RECORD AS QUOTES A COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE BUT THE TIMES INSTEAD EXPOSES NEW DIVISIONS HE QUOTES A CABINET SOURCE AS SAYING THE PRIME MINISTER BLAMED GEORGE OSBORNE FOR THE CRISIS SO HIS CHANCE HAD MESSED UP THE CUTSIE ANNOUNCED IN THE BUDGET THE PAPER CALLS IT A RARE SIGN OF DIVISION BETWEEN THE TWO MOST POWERFUL FIGURES IN THE CABINET DOWNING STREET IS DISPUTED THE CLAIM SAYING THE TWO MEN ARE WORKING AS CLOSELY AS THEY'VE EVER DONE
IN THE MAIL PETER OBORNE DESCRIBES CAMERON AND OSBORNE AS POLITICAL TWINS ALTHOUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S REPUTATION HAS FALLEN FARSI SAYS THEY CANNOT BE SEPARATED IF THEY FALL THEY FALL TOGETHER
IN THE GUARDIAN MATTHEW ANCONA UNLIKE LABOUR WHICH WAS SCARRED BY DIVISIONS BETWEEN TONY BLAIR AND GORDON BROWN THIS GOVERNMENT A SEPARATE FROM THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM THE PERCEPTION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS CHANCELLOR ARE TOO CLOSE AND NOBODY ELSE'S TRUSTED HE SAYS DAVID CAMERON MUST OVERRIDE HIS URGE TO SMOOTH THE DIFFERENCES AND INSTEAD DESTROY HIS FOES THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN SAYS AN INVESTIGATION BY THE PAPER HAS FOUND THAT N.H.S. HOSPITALS ARE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS TREATING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
IT HIGHLIGHTS ONE PATIENT WHO COST THE STRUGGLING PORTSMOUTH HOSPITAL'S TRUST ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE CANCER THE CANCER SPECIALIST TELLS THE PAPER THE COSTS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE ITS EDITORIAL URGES AND END TO WHAT IT CALLS HEALTH TOURISM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HISTORIC VISIT TO CUBA IS DESCRIBED BY THE GUARDIAN AS HE'S A BERLIN WALL MOVEMENT IT SAYS THERE IS STILL MISTRUST AND ANXIETY ON BOTH SIDES BUT ALSO EXCITEMENT
THE TELEGRAPH A TRIP MOMENTOUS SAYS THAT OPENING UP CUBA AND HASTENING DEMOCRATIC REFORM WILL BE A WORTHY LEGACY FOR A PRESIDENT WHO WITH LITTLE TO SHOW ON THE FOREIGN POLICY FRONT THE MIRROR THINKS THE VISIT PROVIDES A SALIENT LESSON FOR ALL IT IS BETTER WHEN LEADERS TALK AND ENGAGE INSTEAD OF PROLONGING SENSELESS COLD WARS WAR FIGHTING BATTLES
IT IS TWENTY TO EIGHT NOW WE THOUGHT YOU'VE MANAGED THIS MORNING IS MAYBE STRETCH MAYBE HE'LL PRESS UP OR SIT UP CONTEMPLATE THIS TWENTY SEVEN MARATHONS IN TWENTY SEVEN DAYS THAT IS WHAT THE COMEDIAN EDDIE IZZARD HAS JUST COMPLETED IN SOUTH AFRICA HAVE CAUSE FOR SPORTS RELIEF HE RAISED MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS FOR CHARITY AND JOINS US ON THE LINE NOW MORNING TO YOU EDDIE WHAT IS IT LIKE ON THE MORNING AFTER ALL THOSE MARATHONS BEFORE
IT'S VERY GOOD OF THE BOMBING AFTER WE HAVE FOR TWENTY SEVEN DAYS IT'S ESSENTIALLY A MONTH ABOUT A MONTH BEEN GETTING UP AT FOUR THIRTY TWO FIFTEEN A.M. YESTERDAY FOR THE DOUBLE MARATHON

I REFUSED TO DO JUGGLING A WIFE IS TO USE THE WORD COS I THINK JUGGLING IS WHEN YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU DON'T DO THAT I DO PICK THERE'S SOMEBODY TALKED ABOUT THE AFRICAN BUSHMEN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WHO WHO THEY CAN GO ON FOR CLUMPED AFTER A MILE AFTER MILE AT A CERTAIN SPEED AND IT'S A WONDERFUL NATURAL
RHYTHM WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO ADOPT IT WAS TWENTY SEVEN SO BUT IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION YES I DID THAT LAST TIME I STOPPED WITHIN FOUR DAYS I WAS DOING A HALF MARATHON I LET IT GO THIS WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I READ AROUND THE U.K. AND SO I LET THAT
ABILITY TO TAPER OFF RATHER TOO MUCH I THINK I NEED TO I NEED TO DO MARATHONS I NEED TO BE DOING A MARATHON MONTH MAVE EVERY TWO WEEKS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST TO GET A MEDAL KEEP MATCH FIT
FOR EVER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE DO YOU DO YOU THINK YOU ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY ADDICTED I FRIENDS YOUR RUNNERS AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT SEARCH THAT THEY GET IN THEIR BODY AS A RESULT OF RUNNING DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU GET THAT SENSE THAT IF YOU WERE EVER TO PACK IT IN OR EVEN SLOW DOWN YOU'D NEED YOUR BODY WOULDN'T LIKE IT
WELL YOU SEE WHEN THAT ALL ANIMALS WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THIS THE RIGHT WAY ROUND THIS SHE'S GETTING RID OF REFINED SUGAR FROM MY FROM OUR BODIES I GOT RID OF IT AND TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT GOT TO THE WEIGHT LOSS WHICH I COULDN'T SHIFT FOR AGES
REFINED SUGAR IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OUR BODIES IN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE PUT IN AND BUT ALSO A NATURAL ANIMALS WE S'POSED TO MOVE AND WE THINK AFTER MEMBER MOON MOVED WHEN WE WERE KIDS WE THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD AND THEN WE THOUGHT WELL LET'S LET'S DO LESS OF THAT NO WE SHOULD KEEP THAT GOING THAT KIND OF MOVEMENT IN NATURAL PEOPLE HUNTERS ALL WILD ANIMALS THEY JUST KEEP MOVING AND WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT SO I KNOW IF I'M ADDICTED TO RUNNING BUT I'M ADDICTED TO
TO THE FEELING OF BEING OUT THERE UNDER THE SUN OR THE RAIN OR WHATEVER IT IS OUTDOORS VITAMIN D. GOING IN ALL THAT STUFF IT'S GOOD AND IT'S HEALTHY AND I LOVE IT BUT NOT AS FAST AS I RAN YESTERDAY NOT THAT FAST AND IF YOU WERE THERE WHAT NEXT YOU DONE FORTY THREE MARATHONS IN THE PAST BUT NOT QUITE IN FORTY THREE DAYS BUT ALMOST WHAT WHAT'S THE NEXT PICTURE
I DON'T KNOW YOU ASK ME RIGHT NOW SORRY SORRY I SHOULD JUST GRADUALLY YEAH I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE A SORT OF GUY DO YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAD MADE THE PLAY
OH I'LL TELL YOU SEEING AS YOU'RE POLITICAL PROGRAMME I'M COMING BACK THERE'S A CERTAIN REFERENDUM COMING UP AND IT'S VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THAT AS I AM I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM I THINK LEAVING EUROPE IS IS IS A CRAZY IDEA FOR HUMANITY ABOVE ALL FAYE I'M FOR US SO I'M GOING TO GET INTO THAT WHICH IS LESS RUNNING ABOUT DON'T RUN AWAY FROM EUROPE IS THE MESSAGE FROM HIS ART
YES RUNNING AND HIDING THE PEOPLE FOR LEAVING FOR RUNNING AND HIDING WHERE BRITISH PEOPLE WE STAY AND FIGHT IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE EUROPE YOU COULD BE INSIDE IT CHANGED WELL ENJOY DEALING WITH THE DEHYDRATION MAYBE HE'LL HAVE THAT STOCK AT THE GLASS OF WATER FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL ONE BUT RAISING AN ENORMOUS SUM OF MONEY FOR CHARITY ONCE AGAIN HE IS ON THANKS
QUARTER TO EIGHT SO IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY ON THE LOWER THIS MORNING IS NICK FOR THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF LEEDS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN WELL I'M NOT GOING TO FIND THIS WEEK EITHER HOLY WEEK WHEN CHRISTIANS WALK WITH JESUS AND HIS FRIENDS TOWARDS WHAT HE KNOWS WILL BE AT
THEIR JOURNEY BEGINS WITH A TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO THE CITY PRECEDES THROUGH A CELEBRATION MEAL THE LAST SUPPER AND COLLAPSES INTO BE TRAIL DENY ALL JUDGEMENT AND EXECUTION DESPITE HAVING BEEN WARNED OF WHAT WAS TO COME THE FRIENDS OF JESUS JUST DIDN'T GET IT
NOT EASY BIT COMES FROM BEING ASKED TO WALK THE STORY AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW THE ENDING ALTHOUGH I DO KNOW ABOUT GOOD FRIDAY EMPTY SATURDAY AND THE RESURRECTION OF EASTER DAY IT'S A BIT LIKE TRYING TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN THE TENSION YOU FELT WHEN YOU WATCHED A THRILLER FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN WATCHING IT FOR THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHAT HOLY WEEK IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME THIS YEAR I JUST GOT BACK FROM A WEEK IN IRAQI KURDISTAN WITH SEVERAL COLLEAGUES WE LISTEN TO THE RUSSIAN OLSSON PLEASE OF POLITICIANS AND OFFICIALS WE VISITED AID PROJECTS IN ERBIL UNTIL HAWK WAY UP NORTH WHO DROVE A THAN A FEW MILES OF MOSEL AND THE ISIS LINES THE MOST POWERFULLY WERE MET INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO STORY SPOKE LOUDLY OF GOOD FRIDAY AND BETRAYAL AND SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION
AND OUR SECOND DAY WE DROVE HIM TO THE NORTHERN KURDISH HILLS TO VISIT A CAMPHOR INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE PEOPLE KNOWN NOT BY THEIR NAMES BUT BY THEIR CATEGORY I.D. PIECE WE TRUDGE THROUGH MUD AND SATIN A SMALL SINGLE ROOM PORTAKABIN HOMES LISTENING TO STORIES OF UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING NOT ONLY A FEW C.D.S AND CHRISTIANSEN SHIA MUSLIMS BUT ALSO OF SUNNI MUSLIMS FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ
ISIS KILL ANYONE AND THEY DESTROY EVERYTHING
IN THE DAYS AHEAD WE MET FAMILIES WHO'D LOST EVERYTHING IN A MOMENT WHEN THEY HEAR DEMANDS THAT THEY SHOULD RETURN HOME THEY WONDER WHERE THAT MIGHT BE THEIR ACTUAL HOME WAS NO LONGER THERE THERE IS NO SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE HANGING AROUND WAITING TO BE REKINDLED THERE'S NO TRUST LEFT BETWEEN ERSTWHILE NEIGHBOURS WHO HAVE NOW BETRAYED ALL BEEN BETRAYED IN THE MOST BRUTAL FASHION
ADD TO THIS PICTURE THAT THE FACT THAT ONLY NINE PER CENT OF PROMISED INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN AID ESSENTIALLY BEEN PAID IN AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFICULTY OF FEELING HOPEFUL HOPEFUL FOR THE DISPLACED AND REFUGEE PEOPLE OR HOPEFUL FOR A RESURRECTION OF ORDER
IN JOHN'S GOSPEL AS HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY WATCH HIM DIE JESUS COMMITS HIS MOTHER'S CHARACTER HIS FRIEND
RESURRECTION CAN ONLY FOLLOW CRUCIFIXION THAN THIS COMMITMENT TO HOSPITALITY CARE AND LOVE CANNOT BE DUCKED THE SITUATION IN IRAQ LIES ROOTED IN DESPAIR HE MUST SURELY BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO STAND WATCHING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR REMARKABLE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS GOING ON IN THE DISTANCE TO MAKE SMALL STEPS OF HOPEFULNESS WHERE GRAND GESTURES APPEARANCE EMPTY OR SPENT SHRAPNEL
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH NICK BAINES THE ANGLICAN BISHOP OF LEEDS TO TIME NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT BARACK OBAMA IS IN CUBA THE FIRST VISIT
BY AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT THERE FOR NEARLY NINETY YEARS AND TODAY HE'LL MEET PRESIDENT CASTRO OF THE BROTHER OF THE MAN HE WAS AMERICAN SWORN ENEMY FOR SO MANY YEARS EVERYONE IS CALLING THIS VISIT WELL NEARLY EVERYONE TRULY HISTORIC BUT THERE ARE CRITICS THOSE WHO SAY LITTLE WILL REALLY CHANGE IN CUBA AS A RESULT OF IT AND INDEED ONLY HOURS BEFORE HE LANDED MORE THAN FIFTY DISSIDENTS WERE BEING ARRESTED FOR MARCHING TO DEMAND IMPROVED HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SUPPLE IS
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN PLANNED TO THE DEGREE FOR THIS HISTORIC VISIT EXCEPT THE WEATHER
SO LAST NIGHT INSTEAD OF A WALKABOUT AROUND THE HISTORICAL TOWN OF HAVANA GLAD HANDING THE LOCALS THE OBAMA FAMILY HUDDLED UNDER PORTICOS SHELTERING FROM THE TROPICAL STORM THAT REFUSED TO BUDGE BUT IGNORE THE VISUAL SYMBOLS REAL BUSINESS IS BEING
THIS RODEO IS AT THE AGRICULTURAL FAIR IT WAS ALREADY SOMBREROS AND SPURS ENDLESS SUE'S PERFORMING AMAZING ROPE TRICKS A FAMILY DAY OUT BUT IT WAS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FIRST AMERICAN COMPANY TO SET UP IN CUBA SINCE THE REVOLUTION TO DISPLAY THEIR GOODS
IS THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES USED TO BOAST ABOUT TRACTOR PRODUCTION AS A SIDE OF THEIR ECONOMIC VIRILITY NOW SAW BERYL STOLEN HORACE CLEMENTS FROM ALABAMA OR SELLING FARM MACHINERY TO THE KING
HERE WHEN THE REVOLUTION HAPPEN AND IT FEELS LIKE A VERY IMPORTANT
ASPECT OF HISTORY AND I THINK THAT THE DRAW BENEFIT THROUGH KARMA'S IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE DOOR PEOPLE COME TOGETHER WE DIDN'T COME DOWN HERE TO SELL
WE CAME DOWN HERE TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY NEED
THE WAY THAT HELPS BILBERRY
THIS IS PART OF A MUCH BIGGER STORY TOURIST NUMBERS FROM AMERICA UP TO SIXTY PER CENT OF LAST YEAR BUT THAT IS AS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IS COMING
THEY COULD SOON BE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN FLIGHTS A DAY COMING INTO CUBA FROM THE U.S. AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE JUST A FEW CHANCERS
THE FIRST U.S. HOTEL GROUP HAS ANNOUNCED IT'S COMING TO CUBA I DON'T THE FLIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT A WHOLE PILE OF C.E.O.S LOOKING AT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
THE PRESIDENT TOO IS KEEN TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON THE CUBAN PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE SKETCH WITH THE COUNTRY'S MOST POPULAR COMEDIAN AND FEE LO
THAT'S THE WRONG WAY THAT'S THE WAY HOME
LIKE THIS I'M GOING AS I WANT
THERE'S A SERIOUS SIDE TO ALL THIS THOUGH HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ARE STILL COMMON THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ARRESTS OVER THE WEEKEND AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID HE WILL MEET DISSIDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT WANT
JOSEPHINA VIDAL CUBA'S TOP DIPLOMAT FOR U.S. TO FAIRS IS AS YOU'D EXPECT WELL DIPLOMATIC BUT MORE OR LESS SAYS MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
THAT OF COURSE IS OPEN TO THIS GLASS AND TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH THE ABOUT EVERY INCLUDING HUMAN BRIDES IN MOCCASIN WHATEVER
BAD CUBA HAS BEEN REALLY CLEAR SAYING BAD DOSE IS JUST NOT FOR NEGOTIATIONS
BUT SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY WHO'S IN CUBA WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IN HAVANA SHOULD GROW UP
THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS A DIFFERENT WORLD BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPENING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE YOU CAN'T WRITE IT AS A NO SOVIET STYLE COUNTRY
ON THE RAIN SWEPT STREETS OF HAVANA THERE IS QUITE SIMPLY A SENSE OF JOY AND RELIEF THAT FIFTY YEARS OF ISOLATION AND SANCTIONS MAY AT LAST BE NEAR HIM
JOHN SO FULL REPORT IN THERE FROM THE HAVANA WELL I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY JAMES RUBIN WHO WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE DURING THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS A BIT OVERBLOWN PERHAPS
YES I THINK THIS IS GETTING ENORMOUS ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PLAYED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AS A LEGACY FOR THE PRESIDENT IN HIS LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED IN KEW BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE OTHER THAN THE AMERICAN TIME WARP IN TERMS OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL BE GONE BUT THE ECONOMIC TIME WARP FOR THE PEOPLE OF CUBA IN THE POLL THAT A CALL
OPPRESSION IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND YET WE DID YOU HEAR THEY'RE IN JOHN TO REPORT A VOTE ALL THOSE CHIEF EXECS WHO WERE GOING OVER THE CUBA NOW AND SNIFFING OUT OPPORTUNITIES
LOOK ONE CAN HOPE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME ECONOMIC PROGRESS FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE AND THEY CERTAINLY DESERVE IT BUT LET'S REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DOING THIS AS PART OF WHAT HE HIMSELF HAS CALLING HIS GRAND VISION FOR FOREIGN POLICY OF BRINGING IN COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA AND IRAN AND BURMA BUT IN THE CASE OF CUBA IT WAS THE UNITED STATES THAT GAVE IN THE CASE OF IRAN IT WAS SORT OF FIFTY FIFTY AND THE CASE OF BURMA IT WAS THE GENERAL'S THEY GAVE VENSO AND CUBA'S CASE
WE JUST CAPITULATED AND SAID O.K. WE'LL STOP ISOLATING YOU AND THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THAT IS AMERICANS LIKE ME AND OTHERS TRAVELLING AROUND THE WORLD WILL STOP HEARING ABOUT YOU WHICH IT'S THE U.S. FAULT THAT CUBA HAS SUCH PROBLEMS THERE WON'T BE PROBLEMS WITH LATIN AMERICA BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS A FUNCTION OF THE CASTRO REGIMES CONTINUE DENIAL OF BASIC RIGHTS TO THE PEOPLE
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE WORLD HASN'T BEEN SAYING OH MY GOD WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN CUBA WHAT CAN THE AMERICANS DO ABOUT IT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING OH MY GOD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHAT CAN THE AMERICANS DO ABOUT IT
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S SORT OF HOW SHALL I PUT THIS US A SMA BEER I GUESS WE WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF OBAMA'S LEGACY YES HE'S TRAVELLING TO CUBA BUT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP HIS VICTORY LAP FIFTY MILES ONE HUNDRED MILES FROM THE AMERICAN SHORES YOU CAN'T TRAVEL AROUND EUROPE THE MIDDLE EAST IN AND BE SEEN AS HAVING HELPED THE WORLD IN FACT THE MIDDLE EAST IS IN CARE ASK EUROPE IS HAVING ITS PROBLEMS AND THE PRESIDENT
WHEN CUBA THAT'S WHY IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE WELL A LITTLE UNFORTUNATE AND A LITTLE
DESPERATE ALMOST IN A SENSE ISN'T IT AND AS YOU SAY HE CAN'T TRAVEL AROUND THE MIDDLE EAST SAYING LOOK WHAT WE HAVE DONE HE HAD TO HAVE SOME SORT OF LEGACY SO THEY'VE THEY'VE GRABBED AT THIS AND EVEN AS THEY'RE GRABBING AT IT WE'RE STILL SEEING HUMAN RIGHTS PROTESTS IN CUBA WERE STILL SEEING LADIES IN WHITE BEING ARRESTED IT'S NOT MUCH OF A LEGACY HAS IT
WELL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS A LEMONADE HE'D A BARNACLE OF THE COLD WAR AN IRRITANT FOR THE STATES IN HER ATTEMPT HAS BEEN A LIMITED ELIMINATED BUT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IS GOING TO BE UP TO THE CASTRO BROTHERS MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS IN CRISIS AND THE THING ABOUT PAST AMERICANS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK THEY
THEY'VE DONE THINGS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH ONE THINKS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT NIXON'S OVERTURES TO CHINA ABOUT GOING TO RUSSIA ABOUT THE SORT OF MASSIVE MASSIVE CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE WORLD AND BRINGING PEOPLE IN FROM THE COLD AND ALL THE REST OF IT I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THOSE OPTIONS WEREN'T OPEN TO THIS PRESIDENT BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WERE HE HASN'T REALLY SEES THEM HAS HE
WELL NOW THE OPTION REALLY WAS OPEN TO THE PRESIDENT HE MADE A DECISION TO KEEP THE UNITED STATES OUT OF ALL THE PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT WAS A CONSCIOUS DECISION IT WASN'T REQUIRED POLITICALLY IT WASN'T REQUIRED ECONOMICALLY AND SYRIA COULD LOOK THEY WERE TERRIBLY AND SYRIA COULD LOOK VERY GOOD AND TODAY HAD HE NOT TAKEN THAT FIELD
WHEN I JUST SERIES LET'S FACE IT WE PULLED OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ AFTER SUFFERING THERE THE PROBLEM AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE ISIS SERIA COLLAPSED WE HAVE BIRD CHAOS ACROSS THE REGION A LARGE SCALE GUERRILLA WARS BEING FOUGHT IN COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY AND WE HAVE REFUGEES
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR TWO DESPERATE TO REACH HERE IN EUROPE SO THAT THE WORLD HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS PRESIDENT OBAMA DECIDED TO TRENCH AND FOCUS ON NARROWER ISSUES LIKE CUBA
WOULDN'T IT BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHETHER HE HIMSELF NOW WHEN HE LOOKS BACK AT HIS EIGHT YEARS THINKS I COULD HAVE DONE IT DIFFERENTLY I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT DIFFERENTLY
WELL HE'S JUST SPOKEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS RATHER DRAMATICALLY ABOUT HIS VIEW OF THE WORLD GIVEN SOME EXTRAORDINARY VIEWS SUGGESTING THAT YOU KNOW HE THINKS ALL THE REST OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT IN THE EUROPEAN ELITE ARE ALL WRONG
THAT HE'S RIGHT AND THAT HE'S DONE IT EXACTLY RIGHT AND HE WILL BE PROVEN RIGHT BY HISTORY I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GREAT THINGS LIKE IRAN AGREEMENT ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND ELIMINATING CUBA BUT THE BIG BIG BIG PROBLEMS OF OUR WORLD HAVE GOTTEN WORSE UNDER PRESIDENT
JAMES RUBIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT THE WEATHER WITH THOMAS YOU'RE FANATIC NICK THANK YOU VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU NOT MUCH HAPPENING TODAY ACTUALLY THERE WILL BE SOME FINE WEATHER AROUND ACROSS THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY ANYWHERE SAFE FROM CORNWALL THROUGH THE ISLE OF WIGHT TO THE SOUTH EAST AND ALSO TO THE EAST OF THE PENNINES FOR SOME SUNSHINE FOR YOU HERE BUT FOR THE REST OF THE U.K. I'M AFRAID IT IS LOOKING PRETTY OVERCAST TODAY A LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE BUT NOT DESPERATELY COLD I THINK FOR MOST MAJOR TOWNS AND CITIES IT'LL REACH AROUND SAY
EIGHT TO TEN DEGREES BUT WITH A BIT OF LUCK IN THE SUNNY HERSELF WON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE THERMOMETER HITS TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DEGREES FOURTEEN IS JUST ABOUT A POSSIBILITY IN LONDON TODAY IN THE WINDS ARE LIGHT TOO SO IF WE GET THAT FOURTEEN IT REALLY WILL FEEL QUITE SPRING LIKE IF WE ALSO GET ALL OF THAT SUNSHINE

HE'S DRIFTING IN THE DIRECTION THAT DIVIDES THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN UNITED STRIKES AT THE HEART OF WHAT DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE TO CAMERON WILL GO ON THE OFFENSIVE TODAY WHEN HE APPEARS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO RESTATE THE CASE FOR AS HE PUT IT MODERN COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM BUT HE'S GOT A FIGHT ON HIS HANDS LABOUR SEEMS TO BE SMELLING THE BLOOD OF GEORGE OSBORNE IN PARTICULAR HERE'S JEREMY CORBIN ON B. B. C. BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
HIS BUDGET SIMPLY DOESN'T ADD UP AND IT UNRAVELLED WITHIN HOURS OF HIM PRESENTING IT AND SO THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME A GEORGE OSBORNE BUDGET AS I'M RAV ALSO SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED TO LOOK VERY MUCH AT THE VERY HEART OF THIS GOVERNMENT AT ITS INCOMPETENCE AT THE WAY IN WHICH PUTS FORWARD PROPOSALS THAT SIMPLY DON'T ADD UP AND EXPECTS THE MOST NEEDY IN OUR SOCIETY TO TAKE THE HIT FOR THEM
I'M GOING IN THE STUDIO BY ANOTHER FORMER LEADER OF THE PARTY MICHAEL LORD HOWARD BUT FIRST OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA COONS BERGER MISTER CORBIN WILL HAVE BEEN SPEAK ON THIS OCCASION FOR MANY LAURA WELL THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOT JUST IAIN DUNCAN SMITH YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF WHAT SOME OF THEM CALLED THE CAMBORNE PROJECT THAT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE BUT I THINK THIS MORNING NUMBER TEN IS ABSOLUTELY REJECT ANY SUGGESTION THAT GEORGE OSBORNE IS SOMEHOW AT RISK
THE TWO MEN ARE EXTREMELY CLOSE POLITICALLY AND IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THIS GOVERNMENT JUST ACT ACTUALLY HOW MUCH THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN STEP BUT DAVID COME IN IT'S GOT HUGE PROBLEMS WITH ALL OF THIS THIS MORNING THAT ISN'T JUST AIYA AN IRRITATION IN OPEN SITE PRIVATELY I CAN TELL YOU IT'S A LOT WORSE THAN IT'S BEEN PUBLICLY THAT SORT OF AREA'S BEEN TURNING BLUE DURING CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD IN RECENT DAYS THERE ARE SOME TORY BACKBENCHERS WHO ACCEPT A VOTE AGAINST THE BUDGET OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A SMALL MAJORITY SO THAT'S A VERY RISKY SITUATION
THERE ARE SENIOR M.P.S CYRIL WE LISTEN ON THIS PROGRAMME AND HOUR AGO SAYING THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER UNPICKING THE PROMISES MADE IN THE HONOUR FESTER THAT'S NOT EVEN TWELVE MONTHS OLD AND IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR HOW THE NEW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY STEPHEN CRABB SPARE A THOUGHT FOR HIM THIS MORNING IT'S GOING TO FIND THAT MONEY A LOT OF SAVINGS AND
IT COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THIS MOST STINGING ACCUSATION OF ALL FROM IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE ACCUSATION THAT TORY CUTS HAVE BEEN CHASING AFTER POOR PEOPLE AND THEY'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THEY'LL VOTE CONSERVATIVE IN ANY CASE THERE FOR DAVID CAMERON WHO BUILT HIS LEADERSHIP ON A PROMISE TO CHANGE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SPENT YEARS BUILDING THE NOTION THAT THE TORIES WOULD BE CAREFUL WITH TAXPAYERS' MONEY BUT NOT CRUEL COMPASSIONATE BUT NOT KALLIS THAT IS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO HIS AMBITIONS
HIS AUTHORITY HE HAS A HELL OF A JOB TO STOP THIS OR SLIDING INTO TOTAL CHAOS AND I'M NOT SURE THE ONE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON CAN DO IT AND YOU KNOW JOHN THE ONLY ONE YEAR INTO THE GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN THE REALLY BIG FIGHTS AND HURT FEELINGS TRADITIONALLY THEY'RE MEANT TO COME A LOT LATER ON THEIR NESTS ON THE OTHER HAND YOU COULD ARGUE I SUPPOSE THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO RECOVER
INDEED BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE HUGE PRESSURE OF THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BEARING DOWN THAT'S AT THE END OF JUNE AND THAT IS WHAT I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IS THROWING ALL THIS IN TO SUCH SHARP RELIEF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN IN RECENT MONTHS HUGE FEELINGS OF CONCERN BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE HANDLED DAVID CAMERON IT'S CALLED AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR A BIT OF CIVILITY AND RESPECT OF BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT
YOU ARE RIGHT WE ARE SOME WAY OFF FROM THE GENERAL ELECTION AND DAVID CAMERON SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE PERFORMS BEST WHEN HIS BACK'S UP AGAINST THE WALL BUT I THINK SO FAR IN THIS GOVERNMENT THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT POLITICALLY THEN HE IS FOUND HIMSELF IN AND I THINK REALLY IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'RE SEEING THE KIND OF DIRECT CHALLENGE TO HIS AND GEORGE OSBORNE'S JOINT PROJECT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THIS BEFORE IN SUCH AN INTENSE WAY
THANKS FOR THAT LAURA LET'S TURN TO LORD HURD NO YOU'RE A MAN WHO HAS ALREADY YOURSELF SEEN OFF A TORY PARTY LEADERS AND HE WAS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH AS I RECALL AND I DIDN'T SEE HIM OFF WILLIAM YOU WERE OUT OF THIS HIGHLY INSTRUMENTAL IN IT WASN'T ACTUALLY THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY MADE A DECISION AFTER THAT DECISION HAD BEEN MADE
THEY MIGHT NEED A SHIP LET'S NOT INVOLVE BEING RELUCTANT THOUGH I WASN'T INSTRUMENTAL IN IN IN THAT THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR LET'S SAY YOU WERE NOT RELUCTANT TO TAKE OVER THE LEADERSHIP
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT LONG AND HARD TO THE RIGHT ANYWAY YOU DID IT WEAK WEAK THAT WE THAT WE CAN BE SO HISTORY TELLS US
IF YOU WERE IN A SIMILAR JUST A DAY THAT SEE IF YOU WERE NOT IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AS YOU ARE BUT IF YOU WERE STILL AN M.P. HOW WOULD YOU BE VIEWING THE LEADERSHIP NOW AND I'D BUY BY THE LEADERSHIP I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THOSE TWO MEN CAMERON AND OSBORNE WELL I WOULD BE TELLING MY COLLEAGUES IF I WERE STILL IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO COME DOWN TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WON A GENERAL ELECTION UNDER DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP
THAT ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS IN THAT ELECTION VICTORY PROBABLY DE MAIN ELEMENT WAS OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY DURING THE FIVE YEARS LEADING UP TO THAT ELECTION FOR WHICH GEORGE OSBORNE AS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER DESERVES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIT
THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A PARTY TO CONTINUE TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY AND THAT WE ALL THEREFORE HAVE TO BEHAVE IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE WAY SO I'D SAY CALM DOWN LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TO SAY THIS AFTERNOON AND REMEMBER OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY YOU WOULDN'T BE SAYING TO MISTER OSBORNE IN PARTICULAR LOOK YOU'VE GOT THIS REALLY BADLY WRONG
NO I WOULDN'T I'D KNOW I WOULD I WOULD ASK PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE PROMISES WE MADE IN OUR MANIFESTO WHICH HAVE TO BE KEPT TIME AND TIME AGAIN PEOPLE SAY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE GET FED UP WITH THEIR POLITICIANS IS THAT THEY MAKE PROMISES IN THEIR MANIFESTOS AND DON'T KEEP THEM AND I ASKED THEM TO REMEMBER JUST HOW DIFFICULT THE JOB OF CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
BALANCING THE BOOKS AS THOUGH IT WERE SOME SORT OF EMPTY PHRASE IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT THAT AS A COUNTRY WE LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE BUT COULD TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE GENERATION THE FUTURE GENERATION MUST INHERIT HER COUNTRY AND AN ECONOMY WHICH IS LIVING WITHIN ITS MEAN AT SILENCING THE BOOKS BY TAKING MONEY FROM DISABLED PEOPLE OR APPEARING TO TAKE MONEY FROM DISABLED PEOPLE EVEN THE REALITY IS THAT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING
AND THEN GIVING IT TO A RICH PEOPLE ALWAYS CHUR PEOPLE IS THAT POLITICALLY FEASIBLE AND ANYWAY ISN'T IT DOESN'T IT FIGHT EVERYTHING THAT DAVID CAMERON PROMISED WERE FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAVE SAID IT'S GOING TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT THAT
PARTICULAR PREPARE THEIR INTENTION WAS TO DO THAT IT'S NOT HAPPENING AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ITSELF IS A COCK UP BUT WELL IT'S A IT'S A GOVERNMENT THAT IS PREPARED TO LISTEN AND PREPARED TO THINK AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE SAY WE THINK YOU THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS CUT IN THE BUDGET ONLY FOUR BILLION POUNDS TO COME OUT OF THE WELFORD BARNEY
IT'S A HUGELY IMPORTANT BIT OF THE BUDGET FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS AND THERE WAS A PROMISE IN OUR MANIFESTO TO BRING WELFARE SPENDING UNDER CONTROL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THAT FOR THE FUTURE VIABILITY OF OUR ECONOMY THAT WELFARE SPENDING IS BROUGHT UNDER CANADIAN DUNCAN SMITH THAT SAYS THAT YOU'RE CHASING AFTER THE PAUL BECAUSE THEY WON'T VOTE FOR YOU ANYWAY HOW CYNICAL CAN YOU GO LOOK JOHN I'VE GOT
I REGARD FOR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH I THINK YOU REALLY I REALLY DO I THINK HE DESERVES GREAT CREDIT ABSOLUTELY GREAT CREDIT FOR THEIR WELFARE REFORM OVER WHICH HE HAS PRESIDED OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THE MOST FAR REACHING WELFARE REFORM WE'VE HAD IN OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES ALL DESIGNED TO HELP BRING PEOPLE BACK INTO WORK WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE COME BACK INTO WORK WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN WORKERS' FAMILIES
DECLINE IT'S A GREAT RECORD IN A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT AND I DO REALLY HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR THAT I'M VERY SORRY THAT HE'S FOUND IT NECESSARY TO GO WELL BUT IF YOU HAVE SUCH A REGARD CRIMINAL PEOPLE SAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHEN HE SAYS WITH THE AUTHORITY BEHIND HIM WHEN HE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS DRIFTING IN A DIRECTION THAT DIVIDES THE COUNTRY RATHER THAN UNITED SURELY HE HAS TO BE LISTENED TO WELL IT'S POSSIBLE TO DISAGREE WITH PEOPLE FOR WHOM YOU HAVE A HIGH REGARD
I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT I HAD A HIGH REGARD FOR DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE I DISAGREE WITH THEM ON WHETHER WE SHOULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION I HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH BUT I DISAGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS WHICH YOU'VE JUST QUOTED BUT YOU MUST ACCEPT THAT HE HAS DAMAGED GEORGE OSBORNE'S LEADERSHIP ONCE CHANCELLORSHIP
WELL I THINK GEORGE OSBORNE'S CHANCELLORSHIP
RESTS ON HIS RECORD AND HIS RECORD I BELIEVE HE'S AN OUTSTANDING HE HASN'T MET ONE OF THE THREE TARGETS SUCH AS WELL YOU CAN DO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THOSE TARGETS LET'S NOT TALK LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REALITY THE WE ARE GOING TO BE THIS YEAR THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY OF ALL THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD
THAT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OWES A GREAT DEAL TO THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE GEORGE OSBORNE'S RECORD I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A BUDGET THAT IS UNRAVELLING
OR WHERE WE'RE HAVING A BUDGET IN WHICH ONE ELEMENT OF IT IS BEING THOUGHT ABOUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE END OF THE WORLD I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHICH PEOPLE NEED NECESSARILY BE GREATLY CONCERNED I THINK IT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS PREPARED TO LISTEN AND THINK AGAIN AND I THINK THAT'S TO HIS CREDIT
ISN'T IT ALL IN THE END ABOUT BRECK'S IT AS YOU SAY YOU ARE A LEADING FIGURE IN THE BRICKS IT MOVEMENT ISN'T THAT REALLY WHAT IS UNDERLYING THIS MISTER DUNCAN SMITH RECKONS HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE ALL RECKONED HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO PROBABLY LOSE HIS JOB ANYWAY AFTER THE REFERENDUM AND SO HE FIGURED I CAN DO THIS NOW AND I'M GOING TO STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION
I REALLY DON'T THINK SO JOHN I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE HIS JOB AFTER THE REFERENDUM AFTER THE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT THE LEADER AFTER THE REFERENDUM ON ON ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHICH IS HAVING AN ARGUMENT ABOUT EUROPE AT THE MOMENT CIVIL WAR NO AN ARGUMENT WHICH I HOPE CAN REMAIN A COURTEOUS ARGUMENT CONDUCTED IN A SPIRIT OF MUTUAL RESULT VERY CHAINS ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH WE'VE GOTTA COME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY
OR AT LEAST THE NEXT FOUR YEARS QUITE PROBABLY GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LABOUR PARTY FOR LONGER THAN THAT SO WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER ON JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL GOT TO KEEP IN OUR MINDS AND REMEMBER AND JUST CALM DOWN
LORD HOWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU JOHN TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT NOW CONSERVATIVES HAVE CALLED EACH OTHER A LOT OF NAMES IN RECENT DAYS POOR TO CALL THE LATEST SHIP TO JOIN THE POLAR FLEET IF YOU GOT THE TUDE CHANCE TO CHOOSE ITS NAME PERHAPS THE NAME OF A FORMER ANTARCTIC EXPLORER SUCH AS HENRY WORSLEY ALL THE MAN WHO BROUGHT US FROZEN PLANET DAVID ATOM
BUT A PUBLIC POLL HAS NOT CHANGED THOSE NAMES IT HAS INSTEAD CHOSEN WAIT FOR IT A S. BOOTY MUG BOAT FACE FOR THE NAME OF A NEW TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUND RESEARCH VESSEL SO WHAT DOES THE FORMER FIRST SEA LORD LORD WEST HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT
IF YOU ASK A DAFT QUESTION MAYBE ABSOLUTELY IF YOU GO FOR CROWDS IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYTHING SO GLOOMY THEN THE AVERAGE BRIT COMES UP WITH SOME STRANGE NAMES ON THE THE THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL THE NARK AS IT'S KNOWN IS ACTUALLY ASKED THE BRITISH PUBLIC MAINLY EXPECTING IT TO BE MARINE RESEARCH FANS PLEASE COME UP WITH SUGGESTED NAMES
THINKING THEY WOULD ALL BE EX ANTARCTIC EXPLORERS ARE ART EXPLORES COS HIS SHIP OF COURSE WILL BE GOING TO THE ANTARCTIC IN ARCTIC AND QUICK AS A FLASH THE THE PRIME ONE WAS BOAT BOAT FACE WHICH WHEN I LOOKED THIS MORNING WAS OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND ALREADY AND RISING STEEPLY THERE WAS ALSO PINGU WHICH OF COURSE WOULD WORK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC BUT NOT NORTH ATLANTIC BECAUSE OF THE WEAR PENGUINS EXIST BOTHA MUS PRALINE YOU SAILING BOAT

DAVID CAMERON WILL DEFEND HIS RECORD TODAY WHEN HE RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS THAT HAS ENGULFED THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SINCE THE RESIGNATION OF THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE PLANS TO CUT DISABILITY PAYMENTS WHICH PROVOKED MISTER DUNCAN SMITH DECISION TO STAND DOWN WILL BE SCRAPPED
THIS MORNING THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CARBON SAID THAT THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD CONSIDER HIS POSITION IN LIGHT OF THE CONFUSION OF HER DISABILITY BENEFITS THE FORMER TORY LEADER LORD HOWARD TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT CONSERVATIVE M.P. SHOULD CALM DOWN AND REMEMBER THE IMPORTANT ROLE GEORGE OSBORNE PLAYED IN WINNING THE LAST ELECTION
THE POUND HAS FALLEN BY ABOUT HALF OF ONE PER CENT IN EARLY TRADING AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE EURO ANALYSTS HAD CONCERNS ABOUT SPLITS AND CONSERVATIVE RANKS ABOUT THE BUDGET IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM A FACTOR
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DESCRIBED HIS VISIT TO HAVANA AS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE CUBAN PEOPLE MY OBAMA IS THE FIRST SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT TO SET FOOT ON CUBAN SOIL IN EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS A NEWS JUSTIN A RUSSIAN COURT HAS CONVICTED A UKRAINIAN PILOT OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF TWO RUSSIAN JOURNALISTS NADIA SUCH ANKLE HAS PROTESTED HER INNOCENCE PROSECUTORS WANT HER SENTENCED TO TWENTY THREE YEARS IN PRISON
THANK YOU SUSAN IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE THEY TAKE FROM THE POOR MAY GIVE TO THE RICH THEY LOOK AFTER THEIR OWN THEY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY WEDDED TO CUTS PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVES HAVE SAID THAT ABOUT THE TORIES OVER THE YEARS NOW THERE IT IS ONE OF THEIR OWN THEIR OWN FORMER LEADER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH
WHO'S SAYING IT SO HOW ON EARTH WILL THOSE HE LEFT BEHIND AT THE CABINET TABLE TRIED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE WE'RE JOINED BY A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF HE'S THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT GREG CLARK MORNING TO YOU MISTER CLARKE GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THE CHARGE THERE MISTER DUNCAN SMITH MAKES HOW DO YOU ANSWER IT
I I DON'T AGREE WITH IAN IAN'S GOOD FRIEND OF NEW BOOK WILL BE A GOOD FRIEND AND ACTUALLY ONE OF HIS BIG ACHIEVEMENTS IN OFFICE IS SOMEONE THAT I THINK HAS CHANGED THE WAY THAT WE NOT ONLY HELP PEOPLE IN VULNERABLE POSITIONS BUT THINK ABOUT THAT THE IDEA THAT WE GIVE PRACTICAL OR HELP THAT WE LOOK WHETHER IT'S THROUGH GETTING PEOPLE
OFF WELFARE INTO WORK WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WE LOOK AT THE PERSON RATHER THAN JUST THE FIGURES IS SOMETHING THAT IAN
HAS ACHIEVED A LOT IN HIS TIME OF OFFICE BUT IT ON THAT HE WAS PUTTING THE POINT IS THAT I WILL BE IT WASN'T IT WAS THAT YOU HAD A CHOICE DO YOU SPEND A BILLION POUNDS ON A TAX CUT FOR THE BETTER OFF OR DO YOU SPEND A BILLION POUNDS CUTTING THE RATE OF BENEFITS FOR THE DISABLED THE CHOICE YOU MADE WAS TO CUT TAXES FOR THE BETTER OFF HE SAYS THAT'S WRONG AND HE SAYS IT'S DIVISIVE
WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TO THE DISABILITY BENEFIT THE OTHER P. I P. CHANGES I TO IAN HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS INCREASING THE SPENDING AND DISABILITIES IS INCREASING THERE WAS AN INDEPENDENT REPORTS THAT SENSE THAT IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AGAIN I THINK THE WHAT HAS BECOME APPARENT IN RECENT DAYS IS THAT
IT NEEDS MORE TIME IN THAT BUT IT WASN'T GOT RIGHT FROM THE FIRST PLACE AND SO IAN FELT FRUSTRATED WITH THAT FOR THE BRILLIANT CUT IS STILL ON THE BUDGET OF MISTER DUNCAN SMITH'S OLD DEPARTMENT SO EVEN IF THE DETAIL MAY CHANGE A BILLION POUNDS OR MORE WILL BE FOUND FROM CUTS IN BENEFITS FROM PEOPLE IN OF WORKING AGE WHILST WEALTHIER PEOPLE GET MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS IN TAX CUTS NO THE FIRST
THE FIRST SAVINGS THAT WERE PROPOSED TO BE MADE FROM THAT WERE ACTUALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THERE IS THE TIME TO RE CONSIDER THEM OUT THE OFFICE OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE MAKING A NEW ASSESSMENT A NEW FORECAST IN ANY CASE IN THE AUTUMN SO THAT'S JUST TO BE CLEAR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE BILLION POUNDS ONE POINT THREE TO BE PRECISE
MAY NOT BE A CUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IT DOESN'T NO CUTS WERE TO BE MADE UNTIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE THAT WAS PROPOSED THAT YOU EVERY BUDGET OF COURSE YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF A
OF A PORTRAIT THAT LOOKS AT ALL ASPECTS OF SPENDING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT AND WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR OTHER COLLEAGUES FELT THAT THIS WAS THIS WAS PREMATURE SO THERE'S A THERE'S A MAP MY BABY THIS IS NOT TO MAKE OUT IT SAYS IT WHERE ONE PARTICULAR ISOLATED CASE AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT ALLOWANCE WAS CUT WHILE YOU CUT TAXES FOR OTHER PEOPLE YOU WANTED TO CUT TAX CREDITS FOR THE WORKING FOR
WHILE YOU WANTED TO CUT TAXES FOR WEALTHIER PEOPLE THERE IS A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR WHICH MY DUNCAN SMITH SAYS ADDS UP TO UNFAIRNESS AND SAYS HE'S DIVIDING SOCIETY AND YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE I DISAGREE WITH THAT AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M PROUD TO HAVE WORKED WITH IAN FOR OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS ACTUALLY IN BEFORE THAT WHEN HE WAS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION WAS THAT HE HAS BEEN
A CHAMPION OF OF HELPING VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD THAT HE HAS AND ABOUT TO BE FURTHER GOVERNMENT HAS YOU'RE GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTO WORK A RECORD NUMBER IS IF YOU'RE ME WIFE TO TO THE DRUGS IT'S ALWAYS ME SAYING THIS I MEAN ANOTHER WORDS HE IS NO DOUBT PLEASE DO YOU LIKE HIM AND ADMIRE HIM BUT HE SAID THE OPPOSITE SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS LED HIM
TO SAY THINGS THAT YOU NOW FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WHAT WILL IAN HAS I THINK GOT FRUSTRATED IN RECENT WEEKS AND IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT LOOK AT EVERY NEGOTIATION OF HER BUDGET IS DIFFICULT I REMEMBER YEARS BACK WHEN I WORK FOR ANOTHER MINISTER IT WAS CALLED THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ROUND THEN HE ALWAYS INVOLVE SOME SOME PRETTY TOUGH DEBATES INTERNALLY
IAN HAS HAS DECIDED HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO ON WITH THAT BUT I THINK IF HE LOOKS BACK AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT HE HAS PERSONALLY TO HIS CREDIT WITH THE CHANCELLOR AND WITH THE PRIME MINISTER YOU KNOW GETTING IN A QUALITY FOR EXAMPLE IN A QUALITY THAT WAS RISING HAS NOW GONE INTO REVERSE IN THE MYTH HAS LAUNCHED THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ATTACK ANYBODY CAN REMEMBER ON HIS OWN PART IN TWENTY YEARS
THIS IS A BIT FRUSTRATED BEHIND THE SCENES ISN'T IT MORE LIKELY THAT HE'S SICK OF AN INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT WHICH ANNOUNCES A CUP ONE DAY AND A BUDGET THEN FORCES HIM TO DEFEND IT AND THEN WITHOUT TELLING HIM DECIDES HE'S GOING TO ABANDON THE CUT LOOK AT THAT THERE ARE STRESSES AND STRAINS IN IN GOVERNMENT OF ALL COLOURS AT ALL TIMES AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO GO ON WITH THAT BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO AS A GOVERNMENT IS TO LOOK TO THE LONG TERM AND RECOGNISE THAT BY
BY COMING TOGETHER AND UNITING ON ANY PROGRAMME THAT IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY JUST NEXT MONTH WOULD BRING IN THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE SOMETHING THAT NO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO DO ARE SEEING IN A QUALITY REDUCING SEEING MORE CORRECT THAT WORK THESE ARE BIG ACHIEVEMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE FOR SEVERAL YEARS VIOLENT CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY SEEM TO BE FALLING THE NUMBER OF MURDERS AND MANSLAUGHTER CASES DROP PRETTY SHARPLY BUT LAST YEAR THEY WENT UP AND THE EXPERTS ARE SUGGESTING A REASON FOR THAT I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR MARION FITZGERALD WHO IS A CRIMINOLOGIST AND VISITING PROFESSOR AT KENT TO CRIME AND JUST THE CENTRE AT KENT UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU HELLO
AND THE REASON IN A NUTSHELL IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHO ARE HARMING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER KILLING THEMSELVES
EACH OTHER I SHOULD SAY OBVIOUSLY I WOULD NEVER EVER USE THE HOMICIDE FIGURES AND YOU SORT OF INDICATOR THEY CAN BE VERY VOLATILE FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT IF YOU REMEMBER THIRTEEN COCKLE PICKERS DROWNED IN MORECAMBE BAY AND THAT BUT HAROLD SHIPMAN'S VICTIMS AS ON THE HOMICIDE RATE IN THIS COUNTRY IS VERY LOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE HERE THOUGH
IS THAT THE ONLY STATISTICS THAT WE COLLECT ON VICTIMISATION FOR ANY ETHNIC GROUPS
IS THE HOMICIDE FIGURES BECAUSE THE NUMBERS SO WE KNOW THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE WAY OVER REPRESENTED IN HOMICIDE FIGURES AND YET WITHIN THE SPACE OF TWO YEARS ALL YOU HAD WAS UNDER TWO HUNDRED BLACK HOMICIDES YOU CAN'T DO MUCH WITH THOSE SORTS OF FIGURES IF WE HEARD FIGURES FOR THE LEVEL OF VIOLENT CRIME
AGAINST DIFFERENT MINORITIES INSTEAD OF WE'VE GOT LOADS AND LOADS OF FIGURES ABOUT MINORITIES OFFENDERS MINORITIES IN THE PRISON POPULATION MINORITIES ARRESTED AND SOMEONE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT COLLECTING FIGURES ON MINORITIES IN THEIR EXPERIENCE OF VICTIMISATION BUT EVEN WHEN WE DO
ADMINISTRATORS HAVE HAD CAUGHT UP WITH THE WAY THE WORLD'S CHANGED THEY'RE STILL DIVIDING EVERYTHING UP INTO A SUPPOSEDLY HOMOGENOUS WHITE MAJORITY AND NON WHITE MINORITIES WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE
IS ACTUALLY THE FACT THAT THE WHITE OTHER GROUP WAS THE SECOND LARGEST MINORITY IDENTIFIED BY THE CENSUS IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WE'VE GOT MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE HERE BORN IN EASTERN EUROPE
AND THERE ARE WEST INDIANS OR IRISH OR CHINESE BUT WE'RE NOT WE DON'T BOTHER TO COUNT THEM BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN COUNTY VICTIMISATION AT ALL AND WHEN WE DO WE'RE STILL LOCKED INTO THINKING OF IT IN TERMS OF ITS ONLY WHITES VERSUS NON WHITE WHITES WHY DO THAT ANY MORE BUT WELL A BIT BUT WHY IS IT SO
DESPERATELY IMPORTANT IN ONCE IN MY TWO ESTABLISHED THAT IMMIGRANTS OR PEOPLE WHO COME HERE TO LOOK FOR THE THERE IS REASON SORRY AREN'T TALKING IF THEY ARE ATTACKING THEMSELVES IS UNSURPRISING WE ALL ATTACK STATISTICALLY WHITE PEOPLE WILL ATTACK WHITE PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE BLACK PEOPLE ATTACKED BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE I'M SLIGHTLY PUZZLED BY WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH
WELL I'M SORRY YOU'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE RAISED THE SUBJECT I'M RESPONDING TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE I KNOW AND I'M SAYING YOU KNOW O.K. IF WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THIS LET'S DO IT SERIOUSLY AND LET'S LOOK TO VIC LOOK AT VICTIMISATION WAR GENERALLY AND YET LET'S UNLOCK FROM JUST LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF WHITE THIS IS NON LIGHT
THAT'S ALL THAT I'M SAYING O.K. BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOMICIDES IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPORTION OF WHITE HOMICIDES WHO WERE VICTIMS OF SOMEONE OF THE SAME ETHNIC GROUP IS NINETY TWO PERCENT THAT IS WHAT YOU GET PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITIES WHO POSSIBLY FOR LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES AND SO ON A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AND VERY MUCH MORE LIKELY TO MIXED AMONGST THEMSELVES
THEN YOU ARE GOING TO PROBABLY GET A HIGHER RATE OF HOMICIDE WITHIN THE GROUP BUT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY BIG DEAL HERE BUT I DO THINK IT'S RISINGS I THINK YOU'RE RAISING SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKED AT BUT I WOULDN'T WAIT TOO MUCH ON THESE SPECIFIC FINDING DRY DOCTOR THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW THE FAVOURED HE'S GONE AT ALL IS EXTRAORDINARY BUT BEYOND THE EXTRAORDINARY SYMBOLISM OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT TOUCHING DOWN IN THE CUBAN CAPITAL OF HAVANA WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THAT THAWING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THAT WERE ENEMIES FOR SO LONG WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL IT MAKE TO THE PEOPLE THERE AND OF COURSE THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL I'M JOINED BY JOHN WHO IS THE U.S. EDITOR AT THE ECONOMIST MAGAZINE AND BY PROFESSOR ELIZABETH DOOR
WHO'S PROFESSOR OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES AT SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR DORE FIRST OF ALL I KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO PUBLISH A STUDY CUBA WHAT DIFFERENCE DID A REVOLUTION MAKE WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THIS MAKE
GOOD MORNING THIS WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE I THINK FOR US IS THE SYMBOLIC END THE VERY REAL DIFFERENCE THAT YOU MENTIONED FOR OBAMA IT'S THE END OF THE COLD WAR IN THE AMERICAS IMPACT ON EVERYONE IN THE AMERICAS FOR CUBA THE U.S. TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE CASTRO
THE CASTRO'S THEMSELVES THE KESTREL GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE YEARS AND THEY FAILED TO DO THAT SO I THINK THAT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE YOU'LL SEE WATCHING TELEVISION PEOPLE
LINING THE STREETS WANTING TO SEE OBAMA WELCOMING OBAMA PEOPLE ARE VERY HOPEFUL STANDARDS OF LIVING HAVE DECLINED DRASTICALLY IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN RUNNING ON EMPTY FROM THAT PERIOD OF TIME
THERE HAD BEEN HOPE THAT THEIR FILM WILL ALWAYS GOING TO SOLVE CUBA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEM IT DID FOR IT DID PARTIALLY EM FOR A WHILE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO ANY MORE LET ME BRING IN JOHN PRETTY THERE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS OPENING AT FINCHLEY OF TRADE IF CONGRESS ALLOWS THAT OPENING TO HAPPEN OF COURSE WILL AFFECT THE STANDARD LIVING IN PEOPLE IN CUBA IS THERE A DANGER IT JUST SPREADS WESTERN INNER QUALITIES INTO A SOCIETY THAT IS ALREADY VERY POOR
I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL HELP STANDARDS OF LIVING IN CUPAR AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THE CUBAN REGIME IS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THERE'S THIS THEORY THAT AS CUBA GROWS A LITTLE WEALTHIER MORE COMFORTABLE PEOPLE MAY START TO DEMAND FOR KINDS OF FREEDOMS THAT
PROBLEM ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA AND THAT'S REALLY THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE OVER THE EMBARGO THE FIFTY YEAR EMBARGO THAT U.S. PLACED ON TRADE WITH CUBA
THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE PRESIDENT'S MOVE SAY NO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE MUCH LIKE LIFE MUCH EASIER FOR THE CUSTER URGED HIM TO SURVIVE
THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TAKEN BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE EMBARGO HAS JUST GIVEN THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AN EXCUSE FOR A PERSISTENT FAILURE AND TAKE AWAY THAT EXCUSE AND YOU ACTUALLY WEAKEN THE REGIME SO THAT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BETTER AND IT'S A BIG ONE
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT BET PROFESSOR DOOR WE SAW THE LADIES IN WHITE AS THEY'RE KNOWN THIS IS A GROUP OF THEIR WIVES OF FORMER POLITICAL PRISONERS BUMBLED INTO VEHICLES BY THE POLICE OUTSIDE A CHURCH A PROTEST TODAY THAT'S AN AWFULLY LONG WAY FORGET TO GO FOR CUBA TO HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THE SORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLITICAL FREEDOMS WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH I THINK THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT DID ME
OBAMA'S TRIP IS NOT A TRIP THAT CUBAN SEE EVER GOING TO CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY ISSUES OF POLITICAL RIGHTS CUBAN SEE THIS TRIPPERS ARE ISSUE ECONOMIC WELLBEING LET ME SAY THAT MANY CUBANS PARTICULARLY OLDER CUBANS THEY'RE WORRIED THEY'RE WARY
BUSINESS SOLVING CUBA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AMERICAN BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY SOLVING CUBA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE PROMISE OF THE REVOLUTION WAS QUALITY
AND TO A GREAT EXTENT CUBANS ENJOYED A GREAT DEAL OF EQUALITY FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL TO ALL THE CUBANS FEARING THAT LOST NOT ONLY A REALLY QUALITY BUT EVEN OF THE GALL OF EQUALITY JOHN PRETTY
THEY WOULD WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER THING WHEN THEY WHICH IS YETTA BARBARA'S SIDE UP BUT HIS SUCCESS AS IF THEY'RE A REPUBLICAN I'M NOT SIGNED UP REMOTELY TO THIS BOX NO THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A BIG PARTISAN DIVIDE ON THIS IN AMERICAN POLITICS IF YOU LOOK AT AMERICA AS A WHOLE PUBLIC OPINION IS IN FAVOUR OF ENDING THE TRADE EMBARGO BY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT FORTY PERCENT SO FAIRLY BIG MAJORITY BUT IT SPLITS ALONG PATHS TO MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS WOULD RATHER KEEP THE EMBARGO IN PLACE
SO IF THERE'S A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT I THINK YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY WILL WILL END IF THERE'S A DEMOCRAT FOLLOWING PRESIDENT BOMBER IT WILL IT WILL CONTINUE JUST JUMP IN THERE BECAUSE IF YOU WERE PROFESSOR
TRUMP AWAY CERTAINLY HELP THE TRUMPET ARE NOT GOING TO BE AMERICA'S NEXT PRESIDENT BUT IF HE WERE TRUMPETS NOT BEEN CRITICISING OBAMA ABOUT THE OPENING POINTS CUBA HE SING HE WOULD DO IT BETTER BUT HE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR TROUBLE I THINK TRUMP WOULD NOT CHANGE IT OBAMA'S POLICY ON CUBA PROFESSOR DORE JOHN PRETTY GOT A LIVER THERE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE IT WAS A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT IN COUNTY DONEGAL YESTERDAY IN THE IRISH REPUBLIC A CAR WENT OFF A PIER AND FIVE PEOPLE DIED THREE OF THEM WERE CHILDREN HER BABY WAS RESCUED THERE WAS A PASSER BY WHO HELPED RESCUE THAT LITTLE GIRL THE BABY FROM THE CAR FRANCES CRAWFORD WAS THE MAN WHO CALLED THE COASTGUARD AND SAW THE WHOLE THING HAPPENING HE SPOKE TO RADIO FOYLE EARLIER AND TOLD ABOUT HOW THE PASSER BY SAVED THE BABY'S LIFE THE MAN SHERIFF

I TRIED TO MAKE IT AN ORDER US DOWN A BIT UP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHOLE CARE JUST ONE DOWN THE NOTIONAL SHE PUSHED EVERYTHING STOPPED IT HEROIN HAD REMEMBERING AND I'VE GOT A BIG ONE PEA DIP IT ON UM
THERE'S A WRECK THAT WAS FRANCE'S CRAWFORD WHO SAW THAT HOLE A TRAGIC ACCIDENT HAPPENING AND THE BABY GIRL IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE IN STABLE CONDITION IN HOSPITAL IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
NOT SO VERY LONG AGO IF YOU'D ASKED YOUR TYPICAL TORY M.P. WHO WOULD BE THE LEADER OF THE PARTY WHEN NOT IF REMEMBERED HE SAID HE'S GOING WHEN DAVID CAMERON RESIGNED YOU'D HAVE BEEN TILT CRAWL BUBBLY OSBORNE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO GET THAT OUT OF THIS MORNING IT'S BEEN A TOUGH WEEKEND FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND THE SPECIALLY TOUGH FOR GEORGE OSBORNE WHEN I JOINED
BY TWO PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT THEY OUGHT TO ANYWAY ISABEL HALDEMAN ASSISTANT EDITOR OF THE SPECTATOR AND GEORGE PARKER POLITICAL EDITOR OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES NOT GOOD HEY ISABEL
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR GEORGE OSBORNE'S LEADERSHIP CHANCES AT ALL I THINK THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S PARTICULARLY BAD IS THIS ROW REALLY CONFIRMS THE SERIOUS DOUBTS THAT MANY CONSERVATIVE M.P.S HAD ABOUT THE CHANCELLOR ALREADY WHICH WAS THAT HE PLAYS GAMES TOO MUCH AND HE ALSO DOESN'T NOTICED SERIOUS ROWS COMING DOWN THE LINE HE THINKS SORTED THINGS OUT DOESN'T SPOT THAT THE WEAK SPOTS IN ANNOUNCEMENTS HE'S MADE
THAT HE DIDN'T SPOT THAT TAKING AN AVERAGE OF THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS FROM DISABLED PEOPLE MIGHT BE A BIT OF A POLITICAL ISSUE IS A PROBLEM WITH HIS JUDGEMENT THAT SOMETHING CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT BEFORE THE BUDGET
I MEAN IT'S ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE WEEK FOR GEORGE OSBORNE AND DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY ABOUT GEORGE OSBORNE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
EXIT A PROBE EXITS OUR HAVE AND SAID TO ME THAT OTHER DAYS DON'T BET AGAINST
GEORGE OSBORNE DON'T BET AGAINST HIM COMING BACK AND I'VE WRITTEN THE POLITICAL OBITUARIES FOR GEORGE OSBORNE ON THE NUMBER OF OCCASIONS REMEMBER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN HE WENT ON THAT RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS YACHT THERE WAS A LONG THIS SHAMBLES BUDGET HE ATTACKED ITS FIASCO IN TWENTY FIFTY EACH TIME WE WERE ALL GETTING VERY OVER HE SAID WESTERN SAINT GEORGE OSBORNE'S COMPLETELY FINISHED BUT DON'T FORGET THE THINGS HAPPENING BETWEEN ALL THOSE EVENTS WHERE THAT THE TORIES WON TWO ELECTIONS AND GEORGE OSBORNE STRATEGY WAS THE HEART OF THEIR CAMPAIGN
BORIS JOHNSON HAS STILL GOT TO PROVE HIMSELF AS A LEADERSHIP CONTENDER ACTUALLY GEORGE OSBORNE'S TROUBLES AT THAT HE'S IN A VERY DIFFICULT JOB BORIS BORIS JOHNSON HASN'T GOT VERY DIFFICULT JOB YET TO PROVE TO THE TORY PARTY MEMBERSHIP TO M.P.S WHO ARE VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT BORIS AS WELL THAT HE CAN MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND THAT HE CAN SURVIVE ROWS AS WELL BUT WE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AFTER JUNE ISOM SHOULDN'T WE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS GOING TO DETERMINE
EVERYTHING THE WHOLE TORY WORLD WILL LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ON THE MORNING OF JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO LOOK I THINK THE THING IS IF THE THE TABOR COME OR GEORGE OSBORNE LOSE THIS REFERENDUM AND WE LEAVE THE E.U. THEY'RE BOTH FINISHED I THINK THEY'LL BE OUT WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO I THINK THAT WILL BE IT REALLY IF THEY WIN HOWEVER YOU CAN SEE A SITUATION WHERE
GEORGE OSBORNE DAVID COME AND SHAKE THE CABINET THEY BRING IN THE YOUNGER EUROSCEPTIC MINISTERS TRY TO PEEL OFF THE DISTANCE CHART AND EMBITTERED OLD BRICKS TEARS THEY TRY TO REBUILD THEIR AUTHORITY AND IF THEM IN THIS IS A VERY POLLYANNA ISH SCENARIO I ACCEPTED YOUR GEORGE OSBORNE IF THE ECONOMY THEN STARTS TO PICK UP GEORGE OSBORNE'S FORTUNE START TO RISE WITH THE ECONOMY
IF HE TOOK A EUROSCEPTIC RUNNING MATE WITH HIM SOMEONE WHO HAD CAMPAIGNED FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WOULD BE A WAY OF BRINGING THE PARTY BACK TOGETHER TO SAY LOOK THE TWO OF US ARE RUNNING FOR THE TOP JOB AND WE CAN BRING THE PARTY BACK TOGETHER WE'RE AGREEING WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO AGREE AGAIN ALL RIGHT
YOU'VE MENTIONED ALREADY BORIS JOHNSON CLEARLY IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN THE RUNNING ANYBODY WE COULD REASONABLY
PEOPLE GET CROSS WHEN WE SPECULATE NOW FAR AHEAD AT A MINERS' DERMOT BUT IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE WAR YORK TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON APART FROM THOSE TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THERESA MAY OF COURSE HAVE THOUGH HER STYLE SEEMS TO HAVE WANED SOMEWHAT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HER LESS PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT SUCH A JOB WITH THE BUSINESS SECRETARY BUT INTERESTINGLY HE'S DECIDED TO THROW HIS LOT IN WITH GEORGE OSBORNE AND DAVID CAMERON STICK WITH THE PRO IN CAMPAIGN RATHER THAN GO WITH THIS
HEAD WHICH WAS HEART RATHER WHICH WAS TO GO WITH THE PRACTICE OF CAMPAIGN SO THAT'S NOTHING WORKING IN GEORGE OSBORNE'S FAVOUR THERE ISN'T A CLEAR ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY I THINK NO IT'S STEPHEN CRABB WHO'S JUST BEEN APPOINTED IN DOUGGA SMITH'S REPLACEMENT HIT LOTS OF M.P.S HAVE STARTED TALKING ABOUT RECENTLY HE'S VERY AMBITIOUS AND HE HAS A GOOD BACK STILL I WAS A SPY AND HE ALSO HAS A VERY GOOD ALLY WHICH IS RUTH DAVIDSON THE SCOTTISH TORY LEADER HE'S ALREADY TIPPED HIM TO BECOME A FUTURE LEADER AND SHE'S VERY POPULAR WITH THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO GET TIPPED OFF AND ON
BUT ALSO THE THING IS HE'S GOT A VERY INTERESTING LIFE STORIES YOU SAY ISABELLE BUT THE FACT IS HE'S NEVER REALLY RUN ANYTHING AND I THINK IS YOU CAN OVERDO THE FACT LOST POLITICIANS NOWADAYS HAVE INTERESTING BACK STORIES DON'T THEN WE ALWAYS GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT THEM BUT UNTIL YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE FURNACE OF FRONT LINE OF POLITICS YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE UP YOU'RE SITTING I DON'T YOU WELL AMONGST AMONGST OTHER STILL AMONGST OTHERS ALL RIGHT BEFORE RIGHT ER FOR THAT
THEY'VE GOT A COUPLE OF DIFFICULT MONTHS TO GET THROUGH NOW HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DEAL WITH THE WHOLE WELFARE MESS THAT THEY ARE IN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO DEAL WITH WELFARE AT ALL NOW BECAUSE AFTER THE TAX CREDIT CUTS AND AFTER THIS RATHER DISABILITY BENEFIT CUTS WHERE DO THEY NOW GO YES WHAT THAT'S TRUE I THINK THE THING TO REMEMBER IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WAS RE ELECTED ON A MANIFESTO THAT THEY WOULD CUT THE WELFARE BILL THEY HAVE A STRICT CUP ON IT
AND THEY WOULD DO THIS AT THE SAME TIME AS CUTTING TAXES FOR HIRE IN IT SO IT'S A BIT STRANGE I THINK INTO SMITH HAVE RESIGNED ON EXACTLY THE PRINCIPLE THAT WAS ENSHRINED IN THE TORY MANIFESTO BUT NEVER THAT I AGREE WITH ISABELLE THAT FURTHER DEEP WELFARE CUTS OFF THE TABLE NOW FOR THE REST OF THE PARLIAMENT AND GEORGE OSBORNE'S BEST BET IS THE ECONOMY STARTS TO PICK UP AND ALL THE NASTY STUFF THAT WAS WRITTEN INTO LAST WEEK'S BUDGET STARTS TO EVAPORATE AS WE GO TOWARDS THE NEXT ELECTION IT'S NOT TO TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS RATHER THAN WELFARE CUTS AND IF HE DOESN'T
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE AWKWARD FOR HIM I THINK SO WAS HE WELL HE DOES NEED TO EMBARK ON A REHABILITATION MISSION ONE OF THE THINGS HE REALLY CAN'T IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM IS TO APPEAR TO BE PLAYING GAMES WITH THE EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE DON'T FORGET ONE OF THE EARLY RAILS AFTER THE BUDGET WAS THAT HE'D LINKED
THE E.U. REFERENDUM WITH INSTABILITY AND HE QUOTED THE O.B. ARE SOME TORY SCEPTICS SAID MISS CLAYTON THE OFFICE ACROSS WANTS ENDS UP ON THAT AND IF HE DOES ANYTHING MORE AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT HE'S GOT TO KEEP HIS FINGERS CROSSED THAT THE TORIES WIN THE REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD BUT THE ECONOMY PICKS UP AND SOMEHOW
THEY CAN PUT BACK TOGETHER THIS TERRIBLE MESS THAT THE TORY PARTY'S GOT ITSELF INTO OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS WHAT SHOULD OCCUPY HIM MORE TILL TOMORROW ANYWAY SHOULDN'T IT KEEPING GO AND THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED ISOBEL GEORGE PARKER IT WAS NUMBER OF YOU HAVE EMAILED IN TO SAY WE GOT IT WRONG OR RATHER ONE OF OUR GUEST IT BY SAYING THAT CHURCHILL DIED SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OF COURSE IT WAS FIFTY ONE YEARS AGO GOOD MORNING
