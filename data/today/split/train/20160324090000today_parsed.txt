WEATHER CENTRE THIS MORNING THEY FELT AND I JUST THINK A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU TODAY'S FORECAST WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND WALES THE MIDLANDS AND EASTERN ENGLAND
PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE AT THE MOMENT DRY FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD AROUND WEE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS BUT DON'T BE CAUGHT OUT BY THIS THERE IS RAIN ON THE WAY TO REMEMBER THAT YES AND ONCE IT'S SET IN YOU'LL PROBABLY KEEP IT ALTHOUGH HAVING SAID THAT IT PROBABLY WON'T GET IN TO KENT UNTIL THE LATTER PART OF THE AFTERNOON SEE YOU'VE GOT SOME HOURS IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BUT TURNING DECIDEDLY MUCH WEST OF THERE WE'VE SEEN IT FOR A GOOD FEW DAYS TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT EIGHT TO TWELVE DEGREES
AND NOW TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND ARE DRY ENOUGH START HERE BUT IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THE RAIN SETS IN INITIALLY ACROSS CUMBRIA ON THE LANCASHIRE COAST BUT THEN SPREADING TO ALL PARTS BUT HERE THOUGH THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE SOUTH IS THAT EVENTUALLY I THINK LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THE RAIN WILL STOP AND THERE MAY EVEN BE A BIT OF LATE EVENING BRIGHTNESS WE'RE LOOKING AT A TEMPERATURE HERE AGAIN OF AROUND ABOUT NINE OR TEN DEGREES
THE NORTHERN IRELAND VERY SIMPLISTIC SPLIT HERE THIS MORNING IS WET QUITE WINDY AT TIMES AS WELL AND THEN JUST AFTER LUNCH ALL AREAS WILL HAVE TURN DRY AND THEN LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON THERE'LL BE A WEE BIT OF SUNSHINE MAY BE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OR TWO SHOWERS TEMPERATURES IN THE RANGE OF NINE TO TEN FINALLY TO SCOTLAND
WE'RE HERE TO SAME FRONT PRODUCING MODERATE BURSTS OF RAIN ACROSS THE WESTERN UP SLOPES THE RAIN AFFECTING ALL AREAS EVENTUALLY ALTHOUGH OVER IN THE EAST IT'LL BE DRIBS AND DRABS AND NOTHING TOO PERSISTENT AND THEN COME LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON AGAIN A BRIGHTER PROSPECT ONE OR TWO SHOWERS AND A HIGH OF TWELVE THANKS VERY MUCH PHIL IT'S NOW SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS BRUSSEL STILL NOT SURPRISINGLY DOMINATES THE FRONT PAGES THE SUN'S HEADLINE FIVE BOMBERS ON LOOSE
THE PAPER SUGGESTING AT LEAST FIVE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE TERRACE ON THE RUN IN BRUSSELS LAST NIGHT PRIMED AND READY TO STRIKE THE PAPER SAYS WE HAVE OTHERWISE ONLY HEARD OF ONE THE THE MAN SEEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THE MAN IN WHITE IS BEING CAUGHT IN THE PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN AT THE AIRPORT FOR WHO DIDN'T DETONATE HIS HIS BOMB THE OTHER PAPERS ARE
FOCUSING ON THE VARIOUS OTHER INFORMATION THAT'S COME OUT SINCE THE THE ATTACK BLUNDERS BY BELGIUM LET BOMBER SLIPPED THROUGH THE NET IS THERE TIMES HEADLINE ART TO TURKEY TURKISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL SAID THEY'D WARN THEIR BELGIAN COUNTERPARTS ABOUT ONE OF THE BROTHERS ONE OF THOSE WHO DETONATED A NAIL BOMB BRUSSELS AIRPORT AND THE GUARDIAN BRUSSELS KILLERS LINKED TO PARIS TERROR ATTACKS WITH THE INFORMATION COMING OUT THAT THOSE BEHIND IT HAD KNOWN LINKS TO THE CELL THAT TARGETED PARIS IN NOVEMBER
YEAH THE TIMES ON ITS FRONT PAGE IN THE DAILY MAIL IN VERY GRAPHIC FOREMOST FRONT PAGE BOTH HIGHLIGHT THE NUMBERS ARE MIGRANTS COMING IN THROUGH STAYING AWAY ON LORRIES AND GETTING INTO THIS COUNTRY THE WHOLE OF THE DAILY MAIL'S FRONT PAGE HAS ONE PICTURE IT'S A SORT OF GRAINY SHOT BUT IT MAKES ITS POINT COS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT ARE LORRIES STOPPED BY KENT POLICE THE HEADLINES
AND TWENTY SIX MIGRANTS POUR OUT MORE PROOF IF IT WAS NEEDED WE'VE LOST CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS AND THE TIMES HAS THE SAME STORY ON ITS FRONT PAGE AND SAYS THE HOME OFFICE IS INSISTING THAT SENSE THE SUICIDE BOMBINGS ALL HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES ARE BEING CHECKED AT CALAIS DUNKIRK AND COOK KEL IN REALITY THOUGH THE PAPERS SUGGESTS THAT MANY VEHICLES ARE NOT CHECKED UNLESS THERE IS SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE AND PHYSICAL JERKS DON'T ALWAYS FIND PEOPLE HIDDEN INSIDE
AND IT IS ACTUALLY COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES PAST SIX IT IS A STORY ABOUT A BORDERS THAT LEADS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE HEADLINE IS QUITTING Y. YOU WOULD HELP OUR SECURITY AND THAT QUOTAS FROM SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE WHO USED TO HEAD UP M.I. SIX THE IN SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND HE HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE IN PROSPECT MAGAZINE THAT HAS BEEN PICKED UP BY ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WE'RE JOINED BY OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH BECAUSE HIS ARGUMENT IS WHAT
BUT HIS ARGUMENT IS MORE THAN THE CONVENTIONAL ARGUMENT YOU HEAR FROM THE BRACTS THAT SIDE WHICH IS THAT WE ARE MORE AT RISK BECAUSE OF FREE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE E.U. AND A LACK OF CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS ALTHOUGH HE CERTAINLY SITES THAT HE GOES MUCH MUCH FURTHER AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S A MORE DAMNING ARGUMENT BECAUSE HE FOCUSES
HIS CRITICISM IT SEEMS TO ME ON THE INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS WITHIN EUROPE IN PARTICULAR ORGANISATIONS LIKE EUROPOL AND PART OF HIS ARGUMENT IS THERE'S ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE SUCH ORGANISATIONS AND HE SAYS HAVE THEM THERE BASICALLY THEY ARE JUST FORUMS FOR DISCUSSION AND QUOTES OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE MORE THAN THAT HE SAYS BECAUSE THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM HIS PHRASE HERE YOU HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SLOWEST AND A LEAKY EST CHIP LEAKY AS CHIPS SUGGESTING
THAT SOMEHOW INFORMATION KIND OF DRIBBLES OUT OF THEM AND HE SAYS THE DANGER FOR LEADING INTELLIGENCE COUNTRIES LIKE BRITAIN IS THEY PUT INFORMATION SUPPORT WHAT HE CALLS A COLANDER AGAIN SUGGESTING THAT INFORMATION LEAKS OUT
AND HE SAYS IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE MUCH BETTER THAN THESE MULTI NATIONAL YOUR ARRANGEMENTS A BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT INTELLIGENCE BY AND LARGE WORKS ON A BI LATERAL BASIS HE DOES NOT BELIEVE HAVE WE LEFT THE E.U. THAT WOULD DAMAGE OUR INTELLIGENCE SHARING WITH THE U.S. HE SAYS WOOD BREAKS OR DAMAGE OUR DEFENCE AND INTELLIGENCE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. I CONCLUDE CAN CONFIDENTLY NO THAT IT WOULD NOT
IN TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT OFTEN CITED BY THOSE WHO WANT TO REMAIN IN AS ONE OF THE KEY ADVANTAGES HE SAYS WILL AT THAT PRETTY MUCH ONLY APPLIES TO CRIMINAL ISSUES IT DOESN'T REALLY IMPACT ON TERRORISM SO IT DOES SEEM TO BE IN THE WAKE OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN BELGIUM WITH THE BRUSSELS ATTACKS HIS KRISTEN REALLY DOES HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE AND NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT'S DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE HOME SECRETARY
MISSUS MAY YESTERDAY WAS ASKED IN THE COMMONS AGAIN WHETHER SHE THOUGHT WE WERE MORE SECURE IN THE E.U. AND AGAIN SHE SAID SHE DID INDEED WHEN SHE CAME DOWN IN FAVOUR OF THAT REMAIN CAMP SECURITY WAS PRETTY MUCH HER KEY ISSUE SHE SAID SHE SAW ALL THE INFORMATION COMING ACROSS A DESK AND SHE DECIDED THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS THE CRITICAL ISSUE THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON ALSO SAYING THE SAME LAST NIGHT I MEAN I THINK THE
THE REASON THIS MATTERS SO MUCH IS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK IN THE WHOLE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO CRITICAL ARGUMENTS ONE IS ABOUT ECONOMIC SECURITY BUT THE NEXT IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AND I SUPPOSE THE CONCERN FROM THE POINT OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND HOME SECRETARY IN THE DEFENCE SECRETARY IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A TERRORIST ATROCITIES GOING ON ACROSS THE CHANNEL INSTINCTIVELY I SUSPECT PEOPLE HAVE AN INSTINCT TO SORT OF DRAW HIM TO PULL BACK TO CLOSE DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND WHEN YOU ALLY THAT TO THE TELEVISION PICTURES
YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES ARRIVING IN GREECE AND ON THE SOUTHERN BORDERS OF EUROPE THAT CREATES AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH PERHAPS PLAYS TO THE BRAKES HAD SIZE ADVANTAGE NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S STAY WITH THOSE IMAGES ACTUALLY HE'S FORTY PER CENT OF ALL THE PLANT REMOVALS OF PEOPLE IN THE U.K. ILLEGALLY HAVE TO BE CANCELLED WE ARE TOLD TO DANNY SURE HOPE FIRST CROSS ONCE I'M ON THE LINE OUT TOLD BY WHOM DANNY
TOLD BY THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION DAVID BOLTON IN A REPORT ON THE WAY THAT REMOVALS ARE CARRIED OUT THEY ARE CONTRACTED OUT TO A COMPANY CALLED TEST SCORE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ESCORTING PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO REMOVE ALL THESE ARE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE IN THE U.K. A FOREIGN OFFENDERS AND ALTHOUGH SOME TWELVE AND A HALF THOUSAND FORCED REMOVALS CARRIED OUT EVERY YEAR
THE FIGURE IS FORTY PER CENT OF ALL ALL THE PLANS I HAVE TO BE CANCELLED AND TICKETS HAVE TO BE CANCELLED THE NUMBER OF TICKETS CANCELLED DURING AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD ENDING IN JUNE LAST YEAR WAS ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AIRLINE TICKETS AND THE REPORTS IT'S OUT THAT A SERIES OF REASONS WHY THIS HAPPENS MANY OF THEM DUE TO A LAST MINUTE LEGAL CHALLENGES BY THE DEPORTEES NON COMPLETE THEIR NON COMPLIANCE ADMINISTRATIVE ERRORS HOME OFFICE PROBLEMS
BUT ALSO A PARTICULARLY WORRYING IS A PROBLEM FOR TESCO IN FINDING ENOUGH ESCORTS TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE BACK AND THAT SUBJECT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE JOB OF SECURING BORDERS IS ALSO ON THE FRONT PAGE OF A COUPLE OF THE PAPERS THIS MORNING WITH THE SAME DURING THE NEIGHBOURS REVIEW AND A SUGGESTION ALBEIT FROM THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES UNION BUT NONETHELESS IN A SUGGESTION THAT THERE ARE JUST AREN'T THE PEOPLE
BEING EMPLOYED NUH NUH FOR THEM BEING EMPLOYED IN THESE ROLES YES I THINK THAT THIS IS CLEARLY RELATES TO PEOPLE COMING IN AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE LEAVING THE U.K.
AND THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE UNION POINTS OUT THAT THEY CANNOT PHYSICALLY CHECK EVERY SINGLE FREIGHT ITEM OF FREIGHT THAT COMES IN BUSINESS THIS IS TOO MUCH AND THIS IS ALL ARISEN BECAUSE MORE THAN FIFTY MIGRANTS ARE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN TWO LORRIES ARE COMING TO BRITAIN THE PAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS
TWENTY SIX IN THE BACK OF A LORRY NEAR CANTERBURY AND ON MONDAY SOME WERE FOUND NEAR THE DOT FOR CROSSING IN KENT AND IT IS A PROBLEM FOR FOR BRITAIN WHAT WHAT THE AUTHORITIES RELY ON IS GOOD INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE UNLESS YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION OFFICERS YOU CANNOT STOP EVERY SINGLE LORRY SO YOU NEED INTELLIGENCE TO BE ABLE TO PICK WHICH ONES YOU SEARCH WILL BE TALKING TO THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES YOU KNOW LATER IN THE PROGRAMME DANISH AUTHOR
TIME NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX V.H.S. GOT A STAY OF EXECUTION YESTERDAY BUT THE DEPARTMENT STORES PROBLEMS ARE FAR FROM
OVER ADAM PARSONS IS HERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHEER YES B.H.S. STAVED OFF ADMINISTRATION YESTERDAY MORNING AFTER ITS CREDITORS VOTED TO ACCEPT A CUT IN THE RENT BILL FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE RETAILERS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR STORES ARE LOSS MAKING COMPANY WHICH HAS DEBTS OF MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS HAVE PROPOSED RENT CUTS OF UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IN SOME STORES AS PART OF A TURNAROUND PLAN B.H.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVE DOWN TOP
GAVE THIS REACTION AFTER THE VOTE WHERE EXTREMELY DELIGHTED I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO BOTH THE LANDLORDS AND ALL THE CREDITORS BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A VOTE OF SUPPORT IN A TURNAROUND PLAN IS THE START OF A JOURNEY BELIEVE ME WE APPRECIATE
THERE'S LOTS TO DO AND ME AND MY TEAM WILL NOW BE ROLE IN OUR SLEEVES UP TO ENSURE THAT THIS ICONIC BRITISH BAND IS HERE IN
TWENTY YEARS' TIME MORE PROFITABLE AND BETTER THAN EVER WELL HAVING ROLLED UP THEIR SLEEVES THE FIRST THING I NEED TO TACKLE IS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUND SHORTFALL IN B.H.S. HIS PENSION SCHEME IF THAT ISN'T ADDRESSED IT COULD STILL BE ENOUGH TO PUSH THE RETAILER TOWARDS ADMINISTRATION
THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND A LIFEBOAT A GOVERNMENT BACKED AGENCY HAS THREATENED THE COMPANY WITH A SOLVENT SAFER DEAL CAN'T BE REACHED TO PROVIDE BETTER FUNDING FOR THAT PENSION SCHEME MCCANNON SAUNDERS IS HEAD OF PENSIONS AT THE LAW FIRM PINSON MASONS AND SHE JOINS US IN THE STUDIO CURRENT MORNING TILL YOU THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CLEARLY AFFECTED BY THIS PENSION FUND HOW BIG A HOLE IS THAT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS
WELL IT'S A VERY LARGE HOLE THAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION IS THE AMOUNT THAT IT WOULD NEED THE SCHEME WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO BUY OUT ITS BENEFITS ON THE INSURANCE MARKET THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS LESS THAN THAT TO KEEP RUNNING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND PAY THE BENEFITS WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'LL GET THAT MONEY FROM
WELL UNLESS THEY CAN GET THAT OUT OF THE BUSINESS AND THAT IS WHAT THE P. P. F. WILL BE SEEING IF IT CAN DO OVER THE COMING PERIOD WHETHER THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF GETTING MONEY OUT OF THEY RESCUED BUSINESS THEN ULTIMATELY THAT MONEY WILL COME FROM THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND ITSELF WHICH HAS HE SAYS A LIFEBOAT FUND
SIR PHILIP GREEN SOLD B.H.S. FOR A POUND A YEAR AGO LOTS OF REPORTS THAT HE HIMSELF IS GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR THE PENSION FUND WOULD THAT BE NORMAL IT'S A POSSIBILITY THAT POSSIBILITY ARISES BECAUSE THE PENSIONS REGULATOR WHICH IS A SEPARATE BODY THAT HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT PAINTING OF THE INTER PROPERLY FUNDED THE PAINTER THE REGULATOR HAS VERY WIDE POWERS TO CALL UPON THIRD PARTIES THAT HAVE HAD A CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY THAT HAS
BEEN INVOLVED IN A PENSION SCHEME TO CALL UPON THOSE PARTIES TO FUN PENSION SCHEMES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHAT THE REGULATOR WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS TO SEE WHETHER A COMPANY ON INDIVIDUAL HAS DONE SOMETHING WHICH HAS PREJUDICED THE LONG TERM FUNDING POSITION AT SCHEME THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND HAS GIVEN B.H.S. SIX MONTHS TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF A COHERENT PLAN
IF THE COMPANY DOESN'T DO THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS EITHER THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY WILL GO INTO ADMINISTRATION INSOLVENCY OR MORE LIKELY THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE BUT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WILL TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME
BUT SAYING THAT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND AND THIS ISN'T MAGIC MONEY IT COMES OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PENSION FUNDS WASN'T EFFECTIVELY INDEED THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND IS FUNDED FROM A LEVEE THAT IT RAISES FROM PENSION SCHEMES AND THAT LESLEY IS CALCULATED IN PART BASED ON HERSELF AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW RISKY THAT PENSIONS SO IRONICALLY PENSION SCHEMES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY IN FUTURE TO CALL UPON THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND WILL PAY THE HIGHEST LEVEL
CURRENT MANNING THANK YOU CAROLINE SAUNDERS FROM PENSIONED MASONS WILL LISTEN TO THAT WITH INTEREST WITH OUR MARKETS GUESS JAMES BEVAN CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT SEA C.L.A. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND JAMES RETAIL IS ALWAYS A COMPLICATED WORLD BUT IT'S PRECARIOUS TIMES HAVE B.H.S. ISN'T IT IT CERTAINLY IS THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN IN DECLINE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIODS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME REAL CHALLENGES AT LEAST NOW WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD THE CAMPUS CLOSE OFF THIS PENSION
WHAT ELSE YOU'VE HAD A STORY THAT IT'S ON THE FRONT OF THE TIMES THIS MORNING STOP REFUNDING VICTIMS OF ONLINE FRAUD OF THE MET CHIEF TELLS BANKS THIS IS THE COMMISSIONER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE SUGGESTING THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS OF FRAUD SHOULD NOT HAVE RECOURSE TO BANKS EASY RETAILERS GOING TO REACT TO THAT DO YOU THINK THERE HAVE BEEN
HOWLS OF DERISION AND PROTEST READY FROM PEOPLE WHO SAY HANG ON A MINUTE WE CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THE HARSH REALITY IS THAT CYBER CRIME IS HUGE THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM TRAVEL SO IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THERE IS A CHALLENGE WHICH I THINK THAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE VERY AWARE OF THE IS THAT
ALL PARTIES IN TRANSACTIONS NEED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HOLDING BACK CYBER CRIME AND THEREFORE TO SAY TO PEOPLE THAT'S NEW TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY TO LOOK AFTER YOUR OWN RECORDS TO AVOID BEING VICTIMS OF CRIME WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS I THINK THIS IS THE DEBATE WE HAVE TO HAVE
I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT THE MARKET'S STERLING QUITE A NOTABLE FULL YESTERDAY ON THE RATE OF STIRLING IS THAT ALL DOWN TO NERVOUSNESS AROUND SECURITY ONGOING BRICKS IT TALKS ABSOLUTELY NOT IF THE BRECHT'S IT STORY GETS GREATER AND I WAS PEOPLE BECOME MORE CANCER AND THEN THE PAN HAS A LOT FURTHER TO FALL THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
TRAN TERMS AGAINST THE DOLLAR OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IS THE DIFFERENTIAL IN GROWTH PROSPECTS FOR THE TWO ECONOMIES AND EXPECTED INTEREST RATE POLICY SO WE'VE ONLY JUST SEEN THE BEGINNINGS OF PEOPLE BECOMING UPSET ABOUT THE PAN
JAMES SAID TODD I'M GOING TO GET YOUR REACTION TO OUR NEXT STORY IN JUST A FEW MINUTES' TIME BECAUSE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES ARE USING CASH TO BUY THEIR OWN SHARES WITH THE EFFECT OF BOOSTING BOSSES PAY PACKETS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DAMAGING THEIR LONG TERM PROSPECTS AFFIRMS FIRMS AND SHAREHOLDERS THAT IS ACCORDING TO THEIR PENSION AND SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP PERK WHICH HE SAID IT'S GOING TO OPPOSE THE PRACTICE UNLESS COMPANIES CAN EXPLAIN WHY THEY'RE DOING IT
IT'S HER SPECS EXECUTIVES ARE USING BACK TO BOOST THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS A PERFORMANCE YARDSTICK USED IN MANY BIG COMPANIES PAY SCHEMES WERE TEN BUSH IS HEAD OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS A PERK ASKED HIM WHAT SHARE BY BACKS ARE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE FOR
THEORY BEHIND DOING IT IS THAT IF YOU USE MONEY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES IN CIRCULATION THEN THE REMAINING SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A BIGGER SHARE OF THE COMPANY THAT'S LEFT BEHIND AND THAT SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THEY HAD BEFORE THE BUY BACK WE'VE GOT TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE BEGUN TO QUESTION WHETHER BY BACKS ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING VALUE IS FOR LONG TERM SHAREHOLDERS AND WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO IS GET COMPANIES ACTUALLY TELL US WHY THEY DOING THEM WHAT KIND OF PERCENTAGE THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES
DO YOU SEE DOING THIS IN ANY ONE YEAR IT'S ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PER CENT ARE SHARED BY BACK CLASSICALLY MAINS THE INDICATOR THE EARNINGS PER SHARE LOOKS BETTER THAN IT WOULD'VE DONE TO HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK THAT COMPANIES DO THIS SIMPLY TO ART OFFICIALLY IMPROVE
THEIR RESULTS IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT BY BACKS AND ASKED THEM FOR A CRITICISM THE FIRST THING THEY WERE USUALLY COME UP WITH IS THAT MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PAY SCHEMES ARE BASED ON IF I'M THE BOSS I DO THIS SCHEME IT MAKES EARNING PER SHARE GO UP I GET A BIGGER BONUS
THERE'S SOMETHING PRETTY DUBIOUS ABOUT THAT IT'S LOGICAL TO DO IT IF THAT'S HOW YOU'VE BEEN INCENTIVISED AND THAT'S HOW YOUR PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE CREATED AND THEREFORE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THAT METHOD OF PAYING PEOPLE WHEN ACTUALLY NOT MUCH ELSE HAS HAPPENED OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT YOU'VE SPENT A BIT OF MONEY WHICH IS ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT ON THE OTHERS MORE CYNICALLY MIGHT SAY YOU HE'S A DIRECTOR A BOSS OF A COMPANY SHOULD BE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HER COMPANY DO YOU WORRY THAT THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON SELF INTEREST IS OVERTAKING
WHAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE DOING FOR THE BEST OF A COMPANY WE DO INTERESTINGLY IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S BEST FOR HER COMPANY IF THE COMPANY WAS TO PAY A SIMPLE DIVIDEND I SUPPOSED TO SHARE BY PACKS IT WOULD SAVE TAX BECAUSE HE SHARED BY BACK TRANSACTION INCURS A FIVE PER CENT STAMP DUTY IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THAT COST CAN BE OF BENEFIT TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS THE NURSE ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY AS WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A LOAD OF
LOTS OF COMPANIES WOULD HISTORICALLY SAY RIGHT WE'LL SPEND THAT ON NEW MACHINERY OR NEW PEOPLE NEW FACTORIES THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THIS SCENARIO AND WHAT EFFECT DOES THAT HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY DO YOU THINK THE FACT THAT DIRECTORS ARE DISTRIBUTING FUNDS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROJECTS TO INVEST IN ONE FEAR IN TIGHTENING UP ON SHARED BY BLACKS WOULD BE THE COMPANIES WERE GOING TO MAKE VALUE DESTROYING ACQUISITIONS INSTEAD THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SHARED BY THAT WERE ILLEGAL THEY WERE ILLEGAL
SHALL WE GO BACK TO THAT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING AT WHY IN THE PAST IT WAS DEEMED TO BE HARMFUL ENOUGH TO BE ILLEGAL THE LOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWYERS MAKE MONEY OUT OF BUY BACKS INVESTMENT BANKERS MAKE MONEY OUT OF BUY BACKS BECAUSE THEY TAKE COMMISSIONS FOR GOVERNMENT HAS ITS LITTLE TAKE TAKES ITS HALF PER CENT SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN BY BACKS OCCURRING AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT WITH INCENTIVES THIS GETS US INTO THE WHOLE FIELD OF PEOPLE DIRECTORS
SEEING COMPANIES AS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RATHER THAN NECESSARILY SEEING THEM AS AS WAYS OF GROWING AN ECONOMY ABSOLUTELY IS IT'S THE ULTIMATE WHAT IT'S GRUDGES FINANCIAL ISATION WHERE THE COMPANY IS SEEN AS A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RATHER THAN THING WHAT SHAREHOLDERS ARE KNOWN AND SHOULD BE GRATING VALUE FROM WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING NOT FROM FINANCIAL ENGINEERING
THERE WAS TEN BUSH THERE FROM PERK OR JAMES BEVAN FROM C. C. L. L.A. WAS LISTENING TO THAT WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY I THINK IT IS BUT THAT BY BACKS HAVE BEEN ABUSED IN SOME INSTANCES IN OTHER WORDS WHERE COMPANIES HAVE
LOAD IT UP UNDER HIS BELT FOR TARA EQUITY TO MAGNIFY OUR WHEN IN FACT IT'S ALL ABOUT RAISING RISK RATHER THAN BUILDING BETTER BUSINESSES HOWEVER IT IS NOT CORRECT TO SAY THAT MAGNIFYING EARNINGS PER SHARE IT'S NECESSARILY WRONG I MEAN AFTER DOES WANT EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT IS THE PRINCIPLE DRIVER OF LONG TERM RETURNS FOR INVESTORS AND THEREFORE THE QUESTION THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ASKED IS WHAT
TO THE BALANCE SHEET HOW EFFICIENT HIS CAPITAL WE HAVE RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE FROM NEXT DAY NEXT OVER THE FIRST COURSE I THINK HAVE SPENT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OF THEIR SHAREHOLDERS' PROFITS BUYING BACK SHARES AND ARE LAUDED BY THE MARKET FOR BUYING BACK THOSE SHARES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR CAPITAL EFFICIENCY OF THE BALANCE SHEET MAKING IT WORK HARDER THE SHOULDERS SO THIS IS WHERE THE REAL DETAIL IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED INTO TERMINAL WHAT IS WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHY
JAMES THANKS FOR THAT FINALLY TESCO HAS REVAMPED ITS RANGE OF FRESH PRODUCE TO COMPETE MORE KEEN WITH DISCOUNTERS ALDI AND LITTLE BRANDED SOME PRODUCTS FOR THE NAMES OF FARMS FOR EXAMPLE I'VE GOT WORK TO THEIR PUNNET OF ROSE DEAN FARM STRAWBERRY SOUND VERY BRITISH IT DOESN'T EXIST THOUGH THESE STRAWBERRIES ACTUALLY COME FROM MOROCCO TESCO MADE UP THE NAME BROS TINA'S WALLIS RED MARE AND BOSWELL FARM SEVERAL OTHERS IT'S A MOVE THAT'S GOT A FEW PEOPLE'S BACKS UP INCLUDING THE NATIONAL FARMERS' UNION WHICH IS WIRED THE LABELLING IS MISLEADING
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA FOOT AROUND US FROM THE RETAIL CONSULTANCY RETAIL REMEDY I THINK I WAS VERY CONCERNED WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF THESE PRODUCTS THAT CUSTOMERS WERE GOING TO BE HOODWINKED BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN VERY UPFRONT AND HONEST THE FACT THAT THESE ARE TESCO AND BRANDS IN THE FACT THAT
TITLED THEM FARMS IT'S REALLY TO DO WITH THE PROVENANCE OF THE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE HAD SOME REAL TURMOIL OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IF YOU WENT TO THE COMPETITORS WHO GIVEN THAT TURMOIL THE LITTLES IN THE ALVIS OF THIS WORLD YOU'D FIND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS
OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE PRODUCTS ARE OWN LABEL AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE SHOP THEY'RE PROBABLY DON'T REALISE
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A FAR MORE HONEST WAY OF PLACING PRODUCTS IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS THAT PERHAPS A LOT OF CUSTOMERS ARE USED TO
WHAT US GO SAYS THE FICTITIOUS FARMS ARE SIMPLY BRAND NAMES RATHER THAN ACTUAL PROVENANCE MARKS AND THE PACKAGING IS CLEAR WHAT DO YOU THINK MAKE YOUR MIND UP I'VE TWEETED A PICTURE OF SOME SPINACH AND SOME STRAWBERRIES FROM THESE FICTITIOUS FARMS IT'S ADAM PARSONS ONE OR MORE RE TWEET THAT ON THE TODAY PROGRAMME ACCOUNT AS WELL I'VE HAD A TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX GARY'S HERE WITH A SPORT

RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HEAD OR NECK CANCER COULD BE SPARED UNNECESSARY SURGERY BECAUSE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MEDICAL SCANNING TECHNIQUES A BRITISH TEAM WRITING IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE SAY ADVANCED IMAGING ALLOWS THEM TO MORE EASILY IDENTIFY SURVIVING CANCER CELLS IN PATIENTS AFTER THEY'VE RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY
RESCUE TEAMS SEARCHING FOR TWO CLIMBERS HAVE BEEN MISSING FOR MORE THAN A MONTH ON BEN NEVIS OR FOUND THE BODIES OF A MAN AND A WOMAN POLICE SCOTLAND SAYS THE FAMILIES OF RACHEL SLATER AND TIM NEWTON HAD BEEN TOLD OF THE DEVELOPMENT
AUSTRALIAN OFFICIALS SAY TWO PIECES OF DEBRIS FOUND OFF THE COAST OF MOZAMBIQUE ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY FROM A MISSING MALAYSIAN PASSENGER JET FLIGHT N. H. THREE SEVENTEEN VANISHED EN ROUTE FROM KUALA LUMPUR TO BEIJING MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO WITH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PASSENGERS AND CREW ABOARD
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN BELGIAN POLICE ARE ON THE HUNT FOR THE BOMBER WHO SURVIVED AND IS ON THE RUN CHRIS MORRIS IS OUR CORRESPONDENT IN BRUSSELS CHRIS THE SUN NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING IS ACTUALLY SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE FIVE BOMBERS ON THE LEASE WHAT INVESTIGATORS THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT WHO THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
THE FOCUS IS THE MAN SEEN ON C.C.T.V. WITH THE WHITE JACKET IN THE BLACK HAT BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN WHAT IS NOT JUST A CELL OF ATTACKERS BUT BUT A NETWORK A NETWORK FROM WHICH EVERY DAY MORE LINKS ARE EMERGING WITH THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST NOVEMBER AND THAT'S PART OF THE WORRYING
ASPECT OF THIS THAT EVEN AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION INVOLVING BELGIAN AND FRENCH OFFICIALS CO OPERATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THE U.K. IN THE U.S. STILL THE SAME NETWORK OR PARTS OF IT WERE ABLE TO TO STRIKE WITH SUCH DEVASTATING EFFECT HERE IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK SO HE IS HE IS THE FOCUS THE MAN IN THE C.C.T.V.
BUT THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE ONE REPORT IN A FRENCH NEWSPAPER SUGGESTING THAT ANOTHER C. C. T. V. IMAGE HAS SHOWN A SECOND POTENTIAL BOMBER ON THE METRO WITH THE SUICIDE BOMBER THERE HE WAS ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED SO
AN AWFUL LOT FOR SECURITY AND POLICE STILL TO DO AND WHILE THEY KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL MORNING MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL GRIEVING THAT HAS TO BE THEIR FOCUS TO TRY AND TRACK DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO MAY WELL BE TRYING AND ALMOST CERTAINLY ARE TRYING TO STRIKE AGAIN AND THE NAMES THAT ARE EMERGING IF IT TRANSPIRES WERE A PEOPLE WHO WERE KNOWN TO THE POLICE
THE BACK ROW WE BROTHERS WHO WERE NAMED YESTERDAY'S WON A SUICIDE BOMBER IN THE METRO ONE AT THE AIRPORT WERE KNOWN TO POLICE FOR A LONG TIME WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS I THINK IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THEY BEGAN TO REALISE HOW CLOSE THEY WERE TO FOR EXAMPLE THE SURVIVING NOW ARRESTED PARIS ATTACKS SUSPECTS SULLA ABTA SLAM THE OTHER NAME DOING THE ROUNDS NOW JEAN LUSH FOR A WEEK
HE IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE BOMB MAKER THE MAN WHO MADE THE SUICIDE BOMBS THAT WERE USED AT THE STUD DE FRANCE IN PARIS THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THIS MORNING THAT HE ALSO BLEW HIMSELF UP AT THE AIRPORT THAT'S TRACES THAT HIT D.N.A. HAD BEEN FOUND I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BUT IS IT ABOUT THIS TIME YESTERDAY HE WAS BEING IDENTIFIED AS THE GUY WHO IS STILL ON THE RUN
THE REPORTS TODAY SEEM TO BE BETTER SOURCED TO BELGIAN AND FRENCH OFFICIALS IN THE BELGIAN AND FRENCH MEDIA BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT TO GET OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION FROM ANOTHER LIKELY PRESS STATEMENT FROM THE BELGIAN FEDERAL PROSECUTOR LATER IN THE DAY CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN FIRST TELEVISED DEBATE BETWEEN THE PARTY LEADERS IN THE SCOTTISH ELECTIONS IS TONIGHT'S AEROSMITH'S UH SCOTLAND EDITOR AND IS ON THE LINE AND SARAH WHO'S HE'S UP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE FOUR PARTY LEADERS NICOLA STURGEON KEZIA DUGDALE RUTH DAVIDSON AND WILLIE RENNIE ALONG WITH THE UKIP IN GREEN PARTLY AS TAKING PART IN THIS DEBATE TONIGHT THE ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO DOMINATE THE WHOLE OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND SO PRESUMABLY TONIGHT'S BROADCAST HIS TAX
BECAUSE FROM NEXT YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT HAS THE POWER TO SET ALL INCOME TAX BANDS AND RATES AND THE PARTIES HAVE COME UP WITH SOME REALLY INTERESTING PROPOSALS POLICIES WHICH ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER U.K. COUNTERPART PROPOSE IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
AND TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THOSE PARTICULARLY THE VIEW OF OF LABOUR WHICH IS REALLY STRONGLY DIVERSION DOESN'T IT FROM WHAT THE BUT THE LONDON PARTIES IT CERTAINLY IS FROM JEREMY CARBON AND JOHN MCDONNELL YOU'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT PUTTING INCOME TAX UP BUT FROM LABOUR IN SCOTLAND
THEY WANT TO PUT THE FORTY FIVE P. RATE UP TO FIFTY P. AND THEY ALSO WANT TO PUT ONE P. ON THE BASIC RATE AND ON THE HIGHER RATE OF TAX OF THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS LABOUR HAVE GONE INTO AN ELECTION ANYWHERE IN THE U.K. SAYING THEY WOULD ACTUALLY PUT INCOME TAX UP THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIMILAR PLANS THEY WANT TO PUT A PENNY ON EVERY RATE OF INCOME TAX
WHILE THE S.N.P. HAVE GOT MUCH MORE MODEST PLANS FOR TAX THEY SAY THEY WOULD PASS ON THE TAX CUT FOR HIGHER EARNERS THAT CAME AND GEORGE OSBORNE'S BUDGET LAST WEEK AND THEIR PLANS HAVE BEEN CALLED TIMID BECAUSE THEY WOULD ONLY TAX HIGHER ROWAN A FEW HUNDRED MORE POUNDS A YEAR AND THEY PUT THE S. AND P. VERY FIRMLY IN THE CENTRE OF SCOTTISH POLITICS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF THEM AS A RADICAL LEFT WING PARTY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM ON TAX THERE IN THE CENTRE OF THE TORIES SAID THEY WOULD ACTUALLY CUT CUT TAXES IF THEY COULD BUT STILL A POPULAR CENTRE
THEY'RE ALL ABSOLUTELY WE KNOW TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT PULLS BUT WHEN A PARTY LIKE THE S. AND P. ARE PULLING OVER FIFTY PER CENT
IT'S NOT JUST VOTERS WHO ARE SIMILAR THEY'RE GOING TO DO WELL THE OTHER OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE WELL A PRETTY MUCH ACCEPTED THAT THE S. AND P. ARE GOING TO WIN AN OVERALL MAJORITY IN THE SELECTION AND THAT THE REAL BATTLE IS FOR SECOND PLACE THE TORIES GOING INTO THE ELECTION SAYING IF YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT THEN CHANGE THE OPPOSITION MAKE RUTH DAVIDSON THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION AND IF THEY COULD DO THAT AND BE LABOUR INTO THIRD PLACE IN SCOTLAND THAT WOULD BE A SEISMIC SHOCK IN SCOTTISH POLITICS SARAH SMITH THANKS
THE TIME TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN WE SHOULD HEAR THIS AFTERNOON WHETHER THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RADHA VAN CARRIED IT IS GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AND WAR CRIMES HE'S BEEN ON TRIAL IN THE HAGUE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE A CORRESPONDENT GUIDER LOIDHNE IS IN SARAJEVO AND THEIR GUIDE BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM HE'S THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTION OF EIGHT THOUSAND MUSLIM MEN AND BOYS
EIGHT THOUSAND MUSLIM MEN AND BOYS WERE MURDERED AND STREB AND IT WHICH IS ONE OF MOST SHOCKING
OCCASIONS SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE LARGEST MASS KILLING IN EUROPE SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND IN SURREY EQUALLY SHOCKING EVENTS THE CITY WAS UNDER SIEGE FOR FOUR YEARS MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED HERE
OVER FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE CIVILIANS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THEM WERE CHILDREN AND JUST IN THE PARK ACROSS FROM WHERE I'M STANDING AT THE MOMENT THERE'S A MONUMENT
TO HUNDREDS OF THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FORM OF PRAYER WHEELS AND DON'T BE ONE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST RELEVANT CARRIAGE JUDGE IS THAT HE ORDERED PEOPLE ORDER PEOPLE UNDER HIS COMMAND
SHELL AND SNIPE AT CIVILIANS IN THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE NOW THE BIT OF THE WHOLE SERIES OF CHARGES LAID AGAINST HIM MANY OF WHICH OF COURSE HE IS EXPECTED TO BE FOUND GUILTY OF THE CHARGES OF GENOCIDE ARE THEY EXPECTED TO STAY
AND IT'S A GENOCIDE OF PEOPLE I SPEAK TO LEGAL EXPERTS AND SURREY OVAL I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM ON THAT IS STRONG ENOUGH
CONFIDENT BUT THERE WILL BE A CONVICTION THE OTHER CASE THAT'S BEING HELD AGAINST RAAVAN CARRIAGE IT GOES BACK TO THE START OF THE CONFLICT IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED OF
CLEARING OUT ALL ETHNIC GROUPS APART FROM ETHNIC SERVES FROM A NUMBER OF MUNICIPALITIES IN BOSNIA AND BY DOING THIS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF SUFFERING AND DEATH AMONG THOSE PEOPLE NOW THAT SURAJ WAS AT ONE POINT DROPPED BY THE HAGUE TRIBUNAL BEFORE
BEING DATED IT'S NOT FAR FROM CLEAR WHETHER THERE'S BEEN
ELECT RAAVAN CARRIAGE ITCH ON THAT CHARGE BUT AS WE'VE MENTIONED IS FACING ELEVEN EXTREMELY SERIOUS CHARGES GENOCIDE WAR CRIMES CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
THE LIKELIHOOD IS YOU WILL BE FOUND GUILTY ON A LOT OF GUYS AND JUST BRIEFLY GUY GIVEN THAT WE ARE WHAT TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER THE EVENT SINCE REB AND EATS A LONGER FOR THAT THERE SINCE THE START OF THE BOSNIAN WAR DOES IT ARE PEOPLE THEY'RE STILL VERY ENGAGED AT IT AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE HEAD
I THINK THERE CERTAINLY ARE I SPOKE TO THE FATHER OF A YOUNG BOY WHO WAS KILLED DURING THE SIEGE OF SURREY OVER AND HE SAYS THIS VERDICT
WILL ALLOW HIM AND OTHER PEOPLE TO FEEL LIKE THEY CAN MOVE ON THE COUNTRY CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT HE SAYS THE COMBI ONLY FORGIVENESS BECAUSE TO FORGIVE WOULD MEAN FORGETTING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE COULD NEVER DO THAT DIE DYLON EH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIME TWENTY TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND AS THE GUARDIAN POINTS OUT WHAT OCCUPIES THE PUBLIC FOREGROUND AFTER THE LATEST MASS KILLING
HAS BECOME GLUMLY FAMILIAR THERE ARE AS IT SAYS THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS THE PHOTOS OF SMILING FACES IN HAPPIER TIMES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SUN AND THE DAILY STAR THERE ARE IN THE DAILY MAIL THE DAILY TELEGRAPH STORIES OF SURVIVAL AGAINST THE ODDS AS WELL AND THERE ARE THE SLOWLY EMERGING DETAILS OF THE ATTACK THE TIMES TELLS HOW THE TAXI WHICH TOOK THE BOMBERS TO THE AIRPORT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ALL THEIR SUITCASES SO THEY LEFT THE MOST POWERFUL BOMB BEHIND
DOCTORS ARE OFTEN PRAISED BY THE PAPERS AS HEROES BUT THEIR DECISION TO STRIKE WITHOUT PROVIDING EMERGENCY COVER IS FIERCELY CONDEMNED THE DAILY EXPRESS CALLS IT DESPICABLE AND SELFISH THE TELEGRAPH BELIEVES LIES WILL BE PUT AT RISK AND SAYS JUNIOR DOCTORS HAVE BEEN ILL SERVED BY THEIR UNION THE SUN SAYS THE DISPUTE IS INFANTILE AND POLITICALLY DRIVEN A DECLARATION OF WAR ON THE GOVERNMENT AND IF ANY PATIENTS DO DIE THE PAPER SAYS
THE DOCTOR'S RESPONSIBLE MUST BE SACKED IT SHOULD SAYS THE SUN HAVE BEEN THE WORST WEEK FOR DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE BOTH EMERGED VIRTUALLY UNSCATHED THOUGH IT SUGGESTS THAT IT BLAMES JEREMY CORBIN THE INDEPENDENT SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER TORE THE LABOUR LEADER APART A QUESTION TIME DAVID CAMERON PULVERISED JEREMY CORBIN SAYS QUENTIN LETTS IN THE MALE CRUSHED HIM
AS THE WEARY OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN WILL FLATTEN A BOILED EGG THE TIME SAYS THE HAPLESS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION WAS CRUCIFIED AND OR BECAUSE LISTS RANKING LABOUR M.P.S INTO FIVE CATEGORIES OF LOYALTY HAD BEEN LEAKED TO THE PAPER POINTS OUT THAT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WERE AND REBELLIOUS MAINLY BECAUSE OF EUROPE THE TORY WHIP'S HAD THREE LESS OF THEIR OWN THE UNHELPFUL THE INSANE AND THERE'S REGARDED AS CONTEMPTIBLE AS TO MERIT A TERM THAT WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BROADCAST
TRAFFIC WARDENS ARE OFTEN VILIFIED BUT JOHN LACEY FROM EXETER IS SO KIND HEARTED THAT THE DAILY EXPRESS CALLS HIM BRITAIN'S NICEST TRAFFIC WARDEN THE PAPER FIND HIS PRAGMATIC APPROACH AND COMMON DECENCY REFRESHING AND HOPES OTHERS WILL LEARN THAT YOU CAN KEEP THE TRAFFIC MOVING FREELY WITHOUT ISSUING MEAN SPIRITED VINES FOR HONEST MISTAKES
THE I'M SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS HAVE SAID THAT ONE OF THE SUICIDE BOMBERS WHO ATTACKED THE CITY'S AIRPORT WAS INVOLVED IN MAKING THE EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PARIS ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE M.P. ANDREW TIREE HAS TOLD BORIS JOHNSON THAT HE HAD A VERY POSH HOLLAND BUSKING APPROACH TO THE E.U. DEBATE
HIS REMARKS CAME DURING A THREE HOUR TREASURY COMMITTEE SESSION WITH THE LONDON MAYOR ON THE PROS AND CONS OF U.K. MEMBERSHIP BORIS JOHNSON INSISTED THAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY WOULD BE GALVANISED OUTSIDE THE E.U. HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SPEND TIME CATCHING UP WITH OLD FRIENDS I SUPPOSE I SHOULD DECLARE PHONE WE GO CHUGGA EXTREMELY WELL WE DO
USED TO BE IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S OFFICES QUITE A LOT
BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE TREASURY COMMITTEE ANDREW TYREE DROPPED THE OLD PALS ACT AS HE STUDIED ONE OF BORIS JOHNSON'S RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLES ABOUT E. U. RULES AND REGULATIONS
AND ONE OF THE RULES THAT YOU SIDE ONE OF THE LUDICROUS RULES AND I QUOTE IS ANY RULE THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T RECYCLE WITH TEABAG AND THAT CHILDREN UNDER EIGHT CAN'T BLOW UP BALLOONS
ANDREW TARRY WANTED TO KNOW WHICH E.U. REGULATION DEALT WITH BLOWING UP BALLOONS BORIS JOHNSON QUOTED FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WEBSITE I BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THAT THE NUMBER OF THE PRESS RELEASE IN A MOMENT YOUR PICK ROOSTING WEBSITE SAYS ADULT SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED IN THE CASE OF THE EWES
ON INFLATED BALLOONS BY CHILDREN UNDERRATE LIKE ANY EXPERIENCED CROSS EXAMINER ANDREW TYREE KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS OWN QUESTION HE'D BEEN READING THE TOY SAFETY DIRECTIVE I JUST KRISTEN
CHILDREN UNDER O.K. PEOPLE SUFFER AND IT'S ASKING WHAT THIS WALL PLACED ON THE PACKAGE
IT'S NOT REQUIRING ALL IT
IT'S ROY HURRIED TO BE PLACED ON THE PACKET IT'S FOR ACQUIRING AWARD TO BE PLACED
IT'S NOT PROHIBITING CHILDREN FROM DAY
WELL I THINK IT EVEN THE EUROPEAN UNION VERY HARD PUT TO INDIVIDUALLY PEOPLE'S HOUSEHOLD IN SUCH WAYS ACTUALLY TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE FROM BLOWING UP BALLOONS PEOPLE UNDERRATE FROM BLOWING UP BALLOONS
WHAT ABOUT TEA BAGS THERE IS OF COURSE THE AND THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF GOLD PLATING THE E.U. ANIMAL BY PRODUCT PRODUCT REGULATION OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
STATED THAT DOES STUFF THAT HAVE COME INTO CONTACT WITH WITH MILK WITH MEAT COULD NOT BE RECYCLED CARDIFF COUNCIL
CARDIFF COUNCIL DECIDED TO INTERPRET THE BIBLE IT'S REGULATION TWO THOUSAND TO IN SUCH A WAY AS TO FORBID PEOPLE FROM RECYCLING
BUT ANDREW TYREE SAID THERE WASN'T AN E.U. REGULATION BANNING PEOPLE FROM RECYCLING TEABAGS IT'S A MISREPRESENTATION TO SET THAT PEOPLE WERE PREVENTED FROM RHYS
WELL THEY ARE BY CARDIFF COUNCIL AS A RESULT THE JUSTLY THAT'S A MUCH BETTER TO SCREW
THERE WAS LOTS MORE IN A SIMILAR VEIN AND OUR PAST AND THEN ANOTHER UNTIL THE M.P.S HAD SPENT THREE HOURS QUESTIONING MISTER JOHNSON TELL TONY YOU ARE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE COUNCIL HAVE AN ALMIGHTY
PART OF FISHERIES CUTS ALL THE SLIPPER MAKES PART OF THE REASON OF COURSE BORIS IS THAT YOU DO OCCUPY THE ODD MINUTE OR TWO HERE IN THE SIDELINES OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE REMARKS EXACTLY THAT CAR
BORIS JOHNSON TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS MORPHING INTO A POLITICAL UNION BUT NO LONGER SERVED THE U.K.'S INTERESTS HE SAID THE IDEA THAT THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE FROM THE E.U. WOULD CAUSE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK WAS TOTAL TRIPE AND HE ACCUSED THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN OF SCAREMONGERING
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO'D DONE SOME BACKGROUND READING MY TARRY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE ROUTE AND INTERESTING PAMPHLET IS SUGGESTING THAT THE SINGLE MARKET COULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A SINGLE CURRENCY
ANDREW TYREE SAID BORIS JOHNSON HAD MISREPRESENTED HE'S VIEWS QUITE BADLY YOU ARE ILLUSTRATING EXACTLY WHAT I BEGAN THE SESSION WITH THE GAME WHICH IS VERY HARD
AND BASKING REALLY HUMOROUS APPROACH TO
A VERY SERIOUS QUESTION FOR THE U.K. MY TYREE SAID THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAD MADE SOME VERY FOOLISH CLAIMS BUT HE COMPLAINED THAT BORIS JOHNSON WAS FUELLING THE FIRE BY PUTTING FORWARD EXAGGERATED ARGUMENTS FOR FROM MY HAVING
CLEAR UP SOME OF THESE GUYS THAT HE'S UP TO THE REMAIN COMPANY
AND THEY'RE RUNNING DOGS IN FATS AND OTHERS TO EXPLAIN WHY TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY HAVE GOT A DANGEROUS OH SHE'S BACK SO STUNNINGLY WONG DELIVERING US GRAINS OF TRUTH WITH MASSES OF NONSENSE LUCY I'M AFRAID SO
THE SESSION WENT ON FOR SO LONG THE M.P.S MISSED PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS WE MAY EVEN NEED TO SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU CARRY ON THAT MY FINAL ANSWER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BORIS I DON'T REALLY WANT ME TO SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BUT AT LEAST HIS COLLEAGUE HAD GIVEN HIM THE LAST WORD
CHILDREN GARRON REPORTING THERE AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE AND WHAT HAPPENED YES IN PARLIAMENT AS USUAL HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO TIME NOT TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN ARE SOME RATHER GOOD NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST A PARTICULAR GROUP OF CANCERS CANCERS OF THE HEAD AND NECK THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER THE HEAD AND NECK IN THE U.K. EVERY YEAR BRITISH RESEARCHERS HAVE PUBLISHED A PAPER IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
SUGGESTING A NEW APPROACH TO HOW TO TRICK THEM PROFESSOR HAITIAN MY HAMMER IS HERE FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR HEAD AND NECK STUDIES AND EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM AND SO'S PAT ROAD'S WHO HAD NECK CANCER AND WAS INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL OF THESE NEW
TECHNIQUES AND PAT WROTE IF I COULD JUST START WITH AND TO TELL US YOU'VE GOT ONTO THIS TRIAL WHAT WAS THE TREATMENT THAT YOU UNDERWEAR
FOLLOWING MY DIAGNOSIS SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I HAD UM FIRST OF ALL I HAD AN OPERATION AND THIS ON MY NECK TOO
REMOVE THE LUMP THAT APPEARED OVERNIGHT FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL AND BIOPSIES UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHETIC
AND FOLLOWING THAT INTENSE RADIO CHEMO RADIOTHERAPY BEGAN
WHICH WAS JUST THIRTY THREE DAYS OF RADIOTHERAPY AND CHEMOTHERAPY AT THE SAME TIME
WHICH ARE THE DAMAGE CAUSED FROM ESPECIALLY FROM THE RADIOTHERAPY
WAS QUITE SEVERE AND I'M BURNING
ALL AROUND THE NECK INSIDE THE THROAT AND ALL AROUND MY NECK YEAH SO THIS WAS NO EASY THING TO UNDERGO EVEN CERTAIN NO NO BUT BUT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE WHAT DID MUCH MORE INVASIVE SURGERY IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE TOLD
YES FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TREATMENT
HAD I BEEN ON THIS OTHER STREAM OF THEY STUDY I WOULD HAVE HAD CONNECT NECK SECTION
WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT ANOTHER OPERATION QUITE A QUITE A SEVERE OPERATION ON TOP OF THE AREA THAT I'D ALREADY HAD AN OPERATION AND WHILST I WAS STILL RECOVERING FROM THE
RADIOTHERAPY DAMAGE AND IN ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT GO WITH THAT AND IS THAT THE POINT PROFESSOR MOHAN AT THAT THIS IS STILL A VERY UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT YOU DON'T NOW I'LL NEED TO HAVE NECESSARILY THAT THAT THAT
FINAL AND POTENTIALLY REALLY DEVASTATING PIECE OF SURGERY YES JUST AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE CASE USING THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUE WE'RE ABLE TO NOW SPARE MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR PATIENTS HAVING HER NECK TO SECTION AT EXACTLY THE TIME WHEN THE THEIR SYMPTOMS AND THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE CHEMO RADIOTHERAPY ART AT ITS MOST
UM WHY IS THAT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO USE IT BETTER TARGETING WHAT IS IT THAT YOU CAN DO NOW THAT IT'S SO UP TILL UP TILL THE TIME WE HAD A PET C.T. WE COULDN'T TELL WHICH PATIENTS HAVE RESPONDED TO THE CHEMO RADIOTHERAPY AND WHICH ONES HAVEN'T IN THE NECKS SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS A BELT AND BRACES APPROACH AND REMOVE ALL THE LYMPH GLANDS IN THE NECK
AFTER THEY'VE HAD CHEMO RADIOTHERAPY BECAUSE A PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WOULD STILL HAVE ACTIVE DISEASE AND THEIR PET C.T. ALLOWS US TO FIND THE LIVING
REMAINING ACTIVE CANCER CELL IN THE PETS IT IS JUST A SCAB AND IT'S IT'S A NINETY FIVE YES IT'S AN ADVANCED WAY OF SCANNING SO IT ALLOWS US TO FIND WHERE THE DISEASES AND FIND THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE THE DISEASE SO THAT WE COULD TARGET WAS PURSUED SURGERY TOWARDS THEM PAT ROOTS MORANT STRUGGLE UP HERE THAT THIS WELL I MEAN
SHE'D NEVER BE CALLED LUCKY IN THE SECOND AS A GETTING NECK AND SAID MY GOODNESS YOU'VE GOT ONTO THE RIGHT TRIAL OF THE RIGHT TO DID YOU CERTAINLY DID ON THE RIGHT AND THE RIGHT STRING YES YES BECAUSE YOU WERE REFERRING TO THE OTHER STREAM SO THIS WAS A TEST IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GET THEIR DREAM TO SEE YES HOW IT WENT BUT BUT THE RESULTS OF THE TEST SO CONCLUSIVE PROFESSOR THAT YOU ARE NOW SUGGESTING WELL WHAT WELL THE RESULTS ARE SO CONCLUSIVE THAT WE WE'RE NOW RECOMMENDING THAT
EVERYONE TREATED FOR HER HEAD AND NECK CANCER FOR THIS TYPE OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER SHOULD BE OFFERED A PET C.T. SCAN TWELVE WEEKS AFTER THE END OF CHEMO RADIOTHERAPY AND THEN ONLY GOING TO NECK TO SECTION IF THEIR PET C.T. SCAN IS POSITIVE AND PAT ROAD'S YOU'RE BEING VERY BLUNT AND HONEST ABOUT IT IS BY NO MEANS EVEN UNDER THIS REGIME A PLEASANT AN EASY PROCEDURE
BUT ISN'T IT STILL MUCH BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES YOU COULD HAVE BEEN OFF YES YES YES I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DEVASTATING A FURTHER OPERATION IN THE SAME AREA WOULD HAVE BEEN
PAT ROADS AND A PROFESSOR HE CHEM HANNAH AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU BERNIE THE TIME SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN A GROUP OF EMINENT FEMALE SCIENTISTS ARE SIGNING A MANIFESTO CALLING ON GOVERNMENTS ORGANISATIONS AND THE PUBLIC TO DO MORE TO GET WOMEN INTO SCIENCE AND TO GET THEM TREATED EQUALLY THE MANIFESTO WILL BE PRESENTED AT THE LORRY UNESCO WOMEN IN SCIENCE CEREMONY TONIGHT IN PARIS IT'S BEEN SIGNED BY THE
WINNERS OF AN AWARD WELL ONLY THREE PER CENT OF NOBEL PRIZES FOR SCIENCE HAVE BEEN WON BY WOMEN AND ONE OF THEM IS ELIZABETH BLACKBURN HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE SILK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SAN DIEGO SHE'S IN PARIS TONIGHT BECAUSE SHE WAS ON THE JURY OF THIS AWARD THE LORRY I'LL UNESCO AWARD AND SHE JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING THAT THE AIMS OF THE MANIFESTO A WHAT
WILL THE AIMS ARE TO INCREASE THE INVOLVEMENT OF WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND AS WE KNOW WOMEN AND SCIENCE ARE GREATLY UNDER REPRESENTED COMPARED WITH THE FIFTY PER CENT THAT THEY OCCUPY ON THE PLANET AND IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SCIENCE IS VERY COMPLEX AND THERE'S NOT JUST ONE APPROACH AND
IN FACT THERE ARE MANY WAYS YOU CAN APPROACH AT THAT RESEARCH AND SUCH THINGS AS BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH WHICH IS MY MY RESEARCH AREA AND SPECIALTY END AND THE ISSUE IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A GROUP OF VERY HOMOGENEOUS PEOPLE WHO DO ALL SEEM TO END OF THE SAME CULTURE OR SAME SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND FOR EXAMPLE THERE TENDS TO BE A MORE SORT OF SINGLE MINDSET OR APPROACH TO SOLVING PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT LEAD YOU TO A SOLUTION
BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY TO LEAD TO WAYS OF REALLY SAW BEING AND APPROACHING COMPLEX VERY MULTI DIMENSIONAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS THINGS THAT WE CARE ABOUT IN TERMS OF HEALTH AS WE JUST HEARD PREVIOUSLY ON THE PROGRAMME CANTERS OR OTHER THINGS LIKE NEURO DEGENERATIVE DISEASES MENTAL ILLNESSES IT'S A HUGE COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND HE NEED DIVERSITY OF APPROACHES AND WOMEN BRING THAT MANIFESTO MENTIONS
THE SORT OF THINGS YOU MIGHT EXPECT LIKE BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS ENCOURAGING GIRLS TO EXPLORE SCIENTIFIC CAREERS ENSURING GENDER EQUALITY BUT IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT PRIORITISING WOMEN'S ACCESS TO SENIOR POSITIONS AND LEADERSHIP POSITIONS WHICH SUGGESTS A QUOTA SYSTEM WOULD YOU BE IN FAVOUR OF SOME SORT OF COMPULSION ON UNIVERSITY'S LABS TO APPOINT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WOMEN
COMPULSORY MAYBE TOO STRONG A WORD BUT I THINK IF THE LEADERSHIP MAKES A VERY STRONG POINT THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE IN A VERY SUPPORTIVE THAN LISTER'S VERY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN PRO ACTIVES SEARCHERS TO FIND WOMEN CANDIDATES AND ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO TAKE LEADERSHIP
POSITIONS I THINK I THINK ONE CAN ACHIEVE THAT KIND OF CALL PERHAPS NOT IN THE COMPULSORY QUOTA WHICH AS YOU KNOW MANY I THINK THAT WAS COMPULSORY QUOTABLE MAKE MANY PEOPLE ALLERGIC AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IT'S
OF THAT APPROACH I THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME AIMS BUT PERHAPS MORE SLIGHTLY SUBTLE BUT CLEARLY WILL STATED GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I FIND THAT THE WIN WIN THAT IS DONE
YOU KNOW I DO FIND THAT IF THERE'S A SEARCH FOR A NEW FACULTY MEMBER FOR EXAMPLE AND IF YOU JUST GET THE NORMAL SEARCH PROCESS TO HAPPEN PASSIVELY MOSTLY MEN A PIE BUT THEN IF ONE GOES OUT AND STARTS PRO ACTIVELY SAYING WILL WHO SOME REALLY TERRIFIC CANDIDATES PEOPLE SAY OH YES NOW I REMEMBER THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC PERSON THAT THEY FORGOT TO MENTION IT AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN SO YOU CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN BY OTHER WAYS THAN COMPULSORY
THE QUOTAS PURSE CAN I JUST HAVE A QUICK THOUGHT FROM YOU WERE BORN IN THE LATE EIGHTIES YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY ONE AND NOW I WISH I WAS BORN IN THE LATE EIGHTIES LATE IT HE'S THE LATE FORTIES I'M SORRY HAVE YOU LOOK AT THAT TILL IT I LIKE THIS I LIKE THIS COULD KEEP YOUR I DO LATE FORTIES AS WELL THEY SAID NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AS A DIFFERENT THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER WE DID WHAT DID YOU WAS IT A STRUGGLE TO BE RECOGNISED FOR YOUR WORK
YOU DON'T GIVE US MORE OF A STRUGGLE I THINK JUST TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE IDEA I WAS GOING TO DO SCIENCE IN THE WINDOWS AND A HER OR A YOUNG COLLEGE UNIVERSITY STUDENT SOMEBODY SAID TO ME VERY SERIOUSLY HE SAID
WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING GOING INTO SCIENCE THIS IS IN AUSTRALIA AND THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE THAT YOU WEREN'T REALLY VERY ACCEPTABLE AND THAT REALLY A TEXT YOU KNOW YOUR IDENTITY AS A WOMAN AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE YOUR NOBEL PRIZE AT HIM NO NO I DIDN'T I SORT OF KEPT KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT BUT I WAS ALL THE MORE DETERMINED TO DO IT A LITTLE BIT YEAH BUT I'M SORRY WE MUST LEAVE IT THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ONE OF THE JIHADIST TO ATTACK THE CITY'S AIRPORT WAS THE MAN SUSPECTED OF HAVING MADE THE BOMBS USED IN LAST NOVEMBER'S ASSAULT ON PARIS UNCONFIRMED REPORTS SAY D.N.A. EVIDENCE HAS LINKS TO BOTH THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS ONE OF THE SUSPECTS RECORDED ON C.C.T.V. PUSHING TROLLEYS THROUGH THE AIRPORT A MAN WEARING A HAT AND WHITE COAT REMAINS AT LARGE HERE'S A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
THE SEARCH FOR THE THIRD MAN IN THE C.C.T.V. IMAGES THE IMMEDIATE FOCUS OF A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION HE WAS CARRYING THE MOST POWERFUL BOMB OF ALL BUT AFTER HE FLED FROM THE AIRPORT IT FAILED TO GO OFF UNTIL AFTER THE DEPARTURES OWN HAD BEEN EVACUATED FINDING HIM COULD BE THE KEY TO UNRAVELLING OTHER PARTS OF THE NETWORK OF VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THAT CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK
TWO OF THE SUICIDE BOMBERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED AS THE BROTHERS BRAHIM AND HALLEY BACK CRY WE FRENCH AND BELGIAN MEDIA REPORTS QUOTE OFFICIAL'S SAYING THE OTHER SUICIDE BOMB AT THE AIRPORT WAS NADIM LASH FOR A WEEK WHO WAS ALSO SUSPECTED OF MAKING THE SUICIDE VESTS USED IN THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST NOVEMBER
NASH IS JUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF LINKS EMERGING BETWEEN THE EVENTS IN PARIS AND BRUSSELS TODAY'S REPORTS NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED SUGGEST THAT HE'S NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM D.N.A. TRACES FOUND AT THE AIRPORT
AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES Y. YOU INTERIOR MINISTERS ARE MEETING IN EMERGENCY SESSION LATER IN THE DAY TO DISCUSS THE URGENT NEED FOR BETTER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND SHARING ISSUES THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR SOME TIME
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON HAS SAID THE TERROR THREAT SHOWS THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO BE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WAS SPEAKING AFTER A FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE ARGUED THAT A BRITISH EXIT COULD LEAD TO IMPORTANT SECURITY GAYNESS WITH THE U.K. INCLUDING GREATER CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION FROM EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES HE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL CAN CORRESPONDENT NORMAN SMITH
THE VIEW OF SENIOR MINISTERS IS CLEAR WE'RE SAFER REMAINING INSIDE THE E.U. INDEED LAST NIGHT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON STRESSED THE BRUSSELS ATTACK UNDERLINED THE NEED FOR EVEN GREATER CO OPERATION AND INTELLIGENCE SHARING SUCH VIEWS HOWEVER HAVE NOW BEEN DIRECTLY CHALLENGED BY SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE
HE CITES NOT JUST FAMILIAR BRECHT'S IT ARGUMENTS OVER BORDER CONTROLS BUT HE'S ALSO HIGHLY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE VALUE OF E.U. BASED SECURITY BODIES DISMISSING THEM AS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE EUROPE OLDE E. USE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HE SAYS CONSISTS OF TWENTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF VASTLY VARYING LEVELS OF PROFESSIONALISM IN INTELLIGENCE AND THAT ITS MEETINGS MUST ACCOMMODATE THE SLOWEST AND LALLY QUI EST SHIP
INTELLIGENCE SHARING HE CONCLUDES IS MUCH BETTER CONDUCTED ON A BI LATERAL BASIS AND THEY WOULD HE SAYS BE NO DAMAGE TO THE U.K.'S CLOSE SECURITY TIES WITH THE U.S. AND BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE IF ANYTHING IN TERMS OF SECURITY IT WOULD BE EUROPEAN SAYS THAT WOULD BE THE LOSER
A REPORT ON THE DEPORTATION OF FOREIGN OFFENDERS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM THE U.K. AND HAS REVEALED THAT FORTY PERCENT OF ALL PLANNED REMOVALS HAVE TO BE CANCELLED THE STUDY BY THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION DAVID BOULT PARTLY BLAMES HER LACK OF STAFF TO ESCORT DETAIL HE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY HERE'S OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT DURING AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD ENDING IN JUNE LAST YEAR ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AIRLINE TICKETS HAD TO BE CANCELLED FOR REMOVAL FLIGHTS FOR PEOPLE ILLEGALLY IN THE U.K. THE REPORT SAID THAT WAS MAINLY DUE TO LATE LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THOSE SCHEDULED FOR DEPORTATION
BUT IT FOUND THAT ANOTHER MAJOR CONSTRAINT WAS THE LACK OF SECURITY STAFF ARE REMOVAL FLIGHTS THE PRIVATE COMPANY TESCO OR WHICH HAS THE CONTRACT TO PROVIDE STAFF WAS ONLY ABLE TO DO SO ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN DAYS LATER THAN REQUESTED
THE HOME OFFICE SAID IT WAS DRAWING UP A NEW CONTRACT AND WAS WORKING TO REDUCE CANCELLED AND FAILED REMOVALS HOWEVER INSPECTOR SAID THE DEPARTMENT HAD FAILED TO ACT ON ONE OF THEIR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO REMOVE OVERSEAS STUDENTS WHOSE VISAS HAD EXPIRED OR BEEN CANCELLED

RESEARCH BY BRITISH SCIENTISTS FOUND THAT PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED HEAD AND NECK CANCERS CAN AVOID UNNECESSARY SURGERY BECAUSE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN SCANNING THE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE SAYS USING ADVANCED IMAGING TO SPOT SURVIVING CANCER CELLS AFTER CHEMO AND RADIOTHERAPY RESULT IN FEWER PATIENTS NEEDING OPERATIONS TO REMOVE THEM HERE'S A HEALTH CORRESPONDENT ADAM
PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED HEAD OR NECK CANCERS TYPICALLY HAVE COMBINED CHEMO AND RADIOTHERAPY FOLLOWED BY AN OPERATION TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO REMAINING CANCEROUS CELLS IN THIS STUDY INVOLVING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY PATIENTS JUST ONE IN FIVE OF THOSE WHO HAD A DETAILED PET C.T. SCAN TWELVE WEEKS AFTER TREATMENT WENT ON TO HAVE THE SURGERY COMPARED WITH FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE TO SCAN
SURVIVAL IN THE TWO GROUPS WAS SIMILAR THE RESEARCHERS SAY USING THE SCANS IN THIS WAY COULD REDUCE COMPLICATIONS FROM SURGERY AND SAVE MONEY THEY SAY THEIR FINDINGS COULD HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MANY OTHER TYPES OF CANCER

MARK GEMMA'S MARKER IS A BELGIAN M.E.P. WHO'S THE LEADER OF THE ENVY EH THE NEW FLEMISH ALLIANCE AT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THE PARTY IS PART OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT IN BELGIUM AND HE JOINS US FROM BRUSSELS NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT BRUSSELS IS BEING TARGETED NOW AND IS HOME TO THOSE WHO ATTACKED IN PARIS
WHY ARE WE TARGETED NOW IT IS I THINK IT WAS A MATTER OF TIME REALLY WE WERE ALL HIGH LEVEL WE HAVE BEEN ON A HIGH LEVEL OF ALERT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW
WE WERE WARNED THAT THERE WERE THREATS BUT UP TILL NOW IT HAPPENED IN DISTANCE CAPITALS PARIS MADRID LONDON
AND NOW IT HAS HAPPENED IN THE HEART OF EUROPE AND IT IS A BIG BLOW THERE DO YOU THINK BRUSSELS HAS A GREATER PROBLEM THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN TERMS OF ITS RADICALISED MUSLIM YOU I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S BIGGER BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM YES WE WE WE SHOULD FACE AT BRUSSELS AS A REGION
HE'S NOT HE HAS NOT THE EFFICIENT STRUCTURES LET'S SAY YOU SHOULD KNOW ONE THING YOU KNOW THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF BELGIUM AND OF FLANDERS AND ALSO EUROPEAN CAPITAL IT HAS ONE MILLION PEOPLE IT IS GOVERNED BY
NINETEEN MAYORESS NOT ONE MARE NOT THREE OR FOUR BUT NINETEEN DIFFERENT MESSER A NINETEEN DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES EACH WITH THEIR FULL POWERS THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX EVEN POLICE SIX POLICE ZONES OR POLICE DEPARTMENTS EACH WITH THEIR OWN CHIEF THEIR OWN TERRITORY ALL WITHIN THIS SMALL ASSIS INTENSITY SMALL SPACES IS IT IS IT IS NOT WORKING WELL
AND WE HAVE SEEN IN YES AND NOT NOT AN EFFICIENT POLICY THE LAST DECADES IN TERMS OF THE MIGRATION POLICY COMBINED WITH LOCAL IN SUFFICIENT INTEGRATION POLICIES AND THAT IS WHAT THE PROBLEM IN BRUSSELS WE HAVE THESE GATEAUX
THESE SUBURBS LIKE AND BAKE YOU WORLD FAMOUS FOR ITS MOMENT MODERN BIG SCAR BIG ON THE LIST THERE ARE OTHERS WHERE YOU HAVE THESE CONCENTRATIONS OFF OFF OFF PEOPLE AND SUB COOKED BUT YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES ARE THERE SOME THAT ARE RUN WELL AND THEN THIS IS THE PROBLEM IS PECULIAR JUST TO THOSE THAT WE ARE ALL THE WORLD IS LEARNING ABOUT YEAH SOME OF THEM ARE OUT I'M NOT RUN BADLY LET'S SAY BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE SEEN A DINOSAUR THE OFF OF POLITICIANS
THAT HER WORK TOO LAX THAT WE HAVE SEEN LACK SCHISM THE LAST TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS
LOOK AT AND BACON WE HAVE HAD THE SAME MAYOR OF FRENCH SPEAKING SOCIALISTS OR SIGNATURE HE HERE HE WAS IT WAS TOO LAX THE V.F. BEEN TOLERATING INTOLERANCE FOR TWO EVER HAVE BEEN BLIND TO IT SO THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE WHAT DO YOU THINK
WELL I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE I WAS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT I'VE BEEN IN THE FLEMISH PARLIAMENT FOR SOME YEARS AND I WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE DONE THE LASTS TEN YEARS TEN YEARS AGO WE DEVELOPED A REAL INTEGRATION POLICY AND DISINTEGRATION OF TRAGIC THAT NEWCOMERS HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS IS COMPULSORY THAT MEANS WE ASK THEM TO LEARN A LANGUAGE
AS FOR A START SO EVERYBODY WHO WHO'S FROM OUTSIDE Y. Y. YOU AND WHO ARRIVES HERE IT IS WELCOME BUT THEY SHOULD LEARN A LANGUAGE THEY SHOULD LEARN ABOUT OUR VALUES AND THEY SHOULD LEARN TO ACCEPT THE WAY WE LIVE
EXCEPT OUR VALUES AND NORMS AND THAT IS THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE IN BRUSSELS AND THEY ARE REALISING NOW THAT THEY SHOULD DO THIS TEN YEARS AGO THERE WAS A LOT OF CHRIS'S CRITICISM ON THE FLEMISH GOVERNMENTS FOR BEING ISLAMOPHOBIC A RACIST BUT WHAT WE ASKED THIS JUST WHO YOU ARE WELCOME HERE
THIS IS AN OPEN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WE HAVE A VALUE YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEM YOU SHOULD RESPECT THEM YOU SHOULD LEARN A LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU GET FOR INSTANCE A SOCIAL FLAT LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR TEN YEARS AND IT'S IT WORKS MARK THAT DENNIS MUKKA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LAWS DESIGNED TO STOP DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DISABLED PEOPLE SIMPLY AREN'T WORKING DISABLED PEOPLE ARE BEING LET DOWN ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF LIFE THIS DAMNING ASSESSMENT OF THE WORKING OF THE TWO THOUSAND TEN DISABILITY ACT COMES FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE WHICH HAS BEEN MONITORING THAT ACT AND BARONESS BRINTON OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS IS A MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE AND HE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND IT'S PARTICULARLY AREA OF TRANSPORT THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED
TRANSPORT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FAILINGS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS NOW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS BUT IT HASN'T BEEN AN ACTED SO THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT THIS GOVERNMENT AFTER GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE BUSES WERE REQUIRED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO TO MAKE CHANGES SO THAT EVERY WHEELCHAIR USER COULD GET ON A BUS
THEY STILL HAVEN'T COMPLIED TAXI'S OUTSIDE OF CENTRAL LONDON WITH BLACK CABS THE LEGISLATION HASN'T BEEN APPLIED IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE JUST TO BE ABLE TO HAIL A CAB THAT CAN TAKE A WHEELCHAIR
AND THAT STOPS DISABLED PEOPLE BEING INDEPENDENT IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT JUST WHEELCHAIRS THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SPILL IT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS HE'S ALL ORGANISATIONS ARE UNDER A DUTY TO MAKE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS AND WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS
CLOSELY MONITORING IS NOT ENOUGH WE HAD WITNESS AFTER WITNESS DEMONSTRATING HOW EITHER NOT BRINGING LAWS INTO EFFECT OR NOT ENFORCING THEM WAS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES AND THIS REPORT WHICH HAS MANY AS YOU COS YOU STARTED WITH WIDE RANGING LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS MOST OF WHICH ARE LOW COST OR NO COST BUT IT REQUIRES GOVERNMENT
PUBLIC BODIES AND PROVIDERS OF SERVICES TO ACTUALLY BECOME PROACTIVE THEY'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO DO NOTHING THE EFFECT OF THAT IS TO PREVENT DISABLED PEOPLE AND THEIR CARERS FROM BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT IN SOCIETY INCLUDING EVEN GOING TO WORK WHY IS IT DO YOU THINK IT WILL POP ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS WHY THE ACTS AND THE VARIOUS ACTS HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWED UP
I THINK IT'S A FOUL OR THROUGH THE REPORT SAYS THAT IT'S VERY MUCH AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM AND FOR EXAMPLE THE RED TAKE CHALLENGE WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY STRONG ABOUT BECAME A PRETEXT AND A PRIORITY OVER DISABLED ACCESS AND DISABLED PROVISION AND WE'RE QUITE CLEAR IN THE REPORT
THAT THAT IS A MAJOR ISSUE MINISTER AFTER MINISTER TALKED ABOUT THE RED TAKE CHALLENGE AND WHEN WE GAVE THEM EVIDENCE FROM OTHER WITNESSES TO SHOW HOW THE DISABLED PROTECTION HAD FAILED THEY JUST SHED BUT TECH CHALLENGE IS MORE IMPORTANT
DISABLED DISCRIMINATION HAS BEEN ILLEGAL NOW FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THAT INCLUDES ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES LIKE TRANSPORT WHAT DO YOU THINK TO BE DONE
BUT IT'S IT'S QUITE SIMPLE THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MAKE ARE ACTUALLY HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND AS I'VE ALREADY SAID THEY ARE LOW COST OR NO COST THAT IS NO REASON
ALL IT TAKES IS POLITICAL WILL TO DELIVER IT AND WE ARE ASKING THE GOVERNMENT
TO REALLY MAKE A STEP CHANGE NOW SO THAT DISABLED PEOPLE CAN START TO LIVE IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNMENT AS IT WAS IT'S ALSO ORGANISATIONS WHERE YOU MENTION CROSS FOR PORT MANSIONS AND WAS RAIL WHICH AND I FROM SEPSIS DAGON DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE STATIONS WERE WITH WITH THAT HAD FREE ACCESS ALL THE TIME AND ALL STATIONS IS THE CASE THIS IS THIS HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT A CRAP MUM SO LUTELY THE PLANNING AND DESIGN FOR CROSSRAIL HAD SEVEN STATIONS WITHOUT STEP FREE ACCESS
AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER A MAJOR CAMPAIGN ACROSS LONDON THAT THAT GOT CHANGED AND THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THING AS SEREN NOBODY'S ATTITUDE AND GOVERNMENT HAS TO LEAD AND IF THERE ISN'T THE ENFORCEMENT RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN THIS CASE ON PLANNING DESIGN
THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT MAJOR HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS THE NUMBER OF TIMES I GO TO A RESTAURANT AND THERE'S A TINY RAMP BUT BY WHEELCHAIR WON'T GET UP IT IT COSTS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT EITHER TO GET A PORTABLE RAMP OR TO PUT A VERY SHORT RAMP IN
BUT BECAUSE THE LAW IS NOT ENFORCED MANY ORGANISATIONS THINK THEY DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ATTITUDE CHANGE TELL VENTILATOR BRITAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST CLOTHING RETAILERS AS SAID JUST REPORTED RESULTS ADAM PARSONS HAS THE MADAM INDEED THANK YOU THIS IS NEXT A FIGURES JUST AN UNDERLYING PRE TAX PROFITS UP FIVE PER CENT AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT WITHIN ITS VERY SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS DOCUMENT A WARNINGS OF TOUGH TIMES AHEAD THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
SIMON WOLFSON WROTE OFTEN SAYS IT WOULD BE SENSIBLE TO PREPARE FOR A TOUGHER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WILL KIRSTY MCGREGOR AS THE NEWS EDITOR WITH THE FASHION BUSINESS MAGAZINE DRAPER'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING FIRST OF ALL LET'S LOOK AT THE FIVE PERCENT RISE IN PROFITS FOR SO LONG NEXT
IN A CITY DARLING DOES THIS UNDERLYING RISING PROFITS SUGGESTS THAT THEY'VE HAD A VERY GOOD YEAR ORDERS A WORD UNDERLINE HIDE SOME OTHER FIGURES IN THERE I THINK THEY ARE SO THAT'S COME IN ABOVE THE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION THAT THEY SORT OF FORECASTS IN JANUARY AFTER THEY HAD A PARTICULARLY TOUGH CHRISTMAS TRADING PERIOD
BUT IT DOES COME IN STILL AT THE LOWER END OF THEIR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES FOR THE YEAR SO IT SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF A TOUGH YEAR FOR NEXT TO NEXT OF COURSE I HAVE AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING VERY WELL THEY'VE HAD A QUITE A LONG RUN OF UNBROKEN GROWTH SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS A BIT OF A SLOWDOWN AND POSSIBLY THAT THAT EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH COMING TO AN END ONE LORD LAWSON TALKS ABOUT PREPARING FOR A TOUGHER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT
BUT I HAVEN'T READ TO THE FULL RESULTS YET SO I HAVEN'T SEEN IF HE'S GONE INTO ANY DETAIL AND THEY'RE A BIT HE'S A TOURIST QUITE PESSIMISTIC IN HIS TRADING UPDATE AND YOU KNOW HE'S I THINK HE'S VERY WELL AWARE OF THE PRESSURES ON THE HIGH STREET SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE RETAIL BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THE MARGINS THERE QUITE TIGHT THEY'VE GOT AIR RISING PROPERTY COSTS AND HE HAS SPOKEN AT RECENTLY ABOUT
THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND BREAKS IT AND ALL OF THE CAN OF RED TAPE THAT'S FACING BUSINESSES AROUND PLANNING PERMISSIONS I THINK YOU'RE DRESSED FRISEE IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE JUST EVERYTHING'S GOING TO GET THAT LITTLE BIT TOUGHER FOR HIGH STREET RETAILERS THIS YEAR INTEREST OF COURSE KIRSTY THAT NEXT IS ONE OF THOSE RETAILERS THAT CLEARLY HAS A HIGH STREET PRESENCE AN ONLINE PRESENCE BUT ALSO A CATALOGUE YES THAT CONTINUED TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL MONEY SPINNER FOR THEM COS THEY'RE A LOT WHO WOULD SAY CATALOGUES ARE VERY TWENTIETH CENTURY
YES IT'S TRADITIONALLY BEEN A VERY STRONG PART OF THEIR BUSINESS AND IT GAVE THEM THE HUGE ADVANTAGE YEARS AGO OF HAVING THE ABILITY TO DELIVER QUICKLY THEY HAD TO THAT BUSINESS ALREADY SO WHEN ONLINE BECAME A MUCH MORE POP THEY WERE SHOPPING THEY ALREADY HAD THE WAREHOUSING CAPABILITIES AND THEY COULD DEAL WITH THAT AND RESPOND TO THAT QUICKLY
BUT AS YOU SAY IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS POPULAR A FORMAT NOW PERHAPS MORE PEOPLE SHOP ONLINE SO THERE IS A CHANGE IN SHOPPING BEHAVIOUR THAT THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH AND THERE HAS BEEN A REAL SAW DOWN IN THE DIRECTORY SALES CUSTOMER THANK YOU THAT IS KIRSTY MCGREGOR FROM DRAPER'S MAGAZINE
THEY GROW MUCH TWENTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY PICTURE ON THE FRONT OF THE DAILY MAIL THIS MORNING APPARENTLY OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BEING CAPTURED AFTER A LORRY DRIVER TOLD THE POLICE THAT THEY GOT INTO HIS VEHICLE AND REFERRING TO THE SAME INCIDENT IT WAS AT DARTFORD IN KENT THE TIME SUGGESTED THERE WERE FIVE CHILDREN CRAMMED INTO THE TRUCK SOMETHING THE POLICE SEEM TO HAVE CONFIRMED IN A STATEMENT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO HOW MANY SIMILAR LORRY LOADS ARE SIMPLY NOT FOUND THOUGH BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH STAFF TO CHECK
A REPORT PUBLISHED TODAY BY THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION SAYS THERE AREN'T ENOUGH STARTER ESCORT PEOPLE OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE EXPEL THE SAME IT'S BEING CLAIMED BY THE EFFORTS TO CATCH THEM COMING IN WE CAN TALK TO LUCY MORTON IS GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS BORDER AGENCY AND IMMIGRATION STAFF THE I S. YOU GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING CAN I JUST START AND WE'LL GET TO THE REPORT ON ON PEOPLE BEING MOVED OUT OF THE COUNTRY JUST A SECOND BUT THE HOME OFFICE SAY HE'S SAYING TODAY THAT SINCE THE SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN BRUSSELS ALL HEAVY GOODS VEHICLES ARE BEING CHECKED AT CALAIS AT DUNKIRK AND COOK HELL AS AS WELL AS THAT YOUR INFORMATION IS THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
THERE'S THE CHEQUES HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH A RAISED AT THE LOCATIONS WHERE WE HAVE STAFF IN THE NORTHERN CONTINENT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF PORTS WHERE WE DON'T AND CAN THAT LEVEL OF CHECKING BE MAINTAINED FOR SOME TIME
NOT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTING THE FLOW OF FREIGHT THE VAST MAJORITY OF GOODS ARE MOVED OUT BY SHIP OVERSEE OR THROUGH THE TUNNEL SO RATHER THAN BEING FLOWN IN AND IF WE WERE TO OVERLY DISRUPT THAT THEN THERE'D BE AN IMPACT ON THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND HE IS THE PROBLEM THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE DOING THE CHECKING OR IS IT MORE FUNDAMENTAL LIKE THAT THEY WERE JUST NOT SET UP TO DO THE CHECKS IN THE FIRST
IT'S A COMBINATION IT WOULD BE TOO SIMPLE TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFF AND OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE IF YOU HAVE MORE STAFF BUT IT ALSO GOES TO THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE LEADING INTO THE PORTS HOW LONG YOU CAN HOLD A LORRY FOR BEFORE THE QUEUE STARTS TO BACK UP STARTS TO IMPACT ON THE UP THE REST OF THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE SHEER NUMBER OF FREIGHT AND SEEMED VERY PORTS ACROSS NORTHERN CONTINENT CONNECTING TO THE U.K. AND WE SIMPLY CAN'T
MEET ALL OF THOSE IN ANY PRACTICAL TERMS AND IF WE TURN TO THE REPORT FROM THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION IS REFERRING TO PEOPLE BEING ESCORTED OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY ARE EXPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY AND SAYING THAT FORTY PERCENT OR SO OF EFFORTS TO DO THAT DON'T
HAPPEN FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND AMONG THOSE REASONS IS A SHORTAGE OF STAFF AGAIN WHAT WOULD WOULD THE RECRUITMENT OF MORE STAFF HAVE A REAL IMPACT YOU THINK
THE RECRUITMENT OF BORDER STAFF WOULDN'T YE COME THAT'S A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR COMPANY THAT ARE ENGAGED TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE FOR US AND SIMPLY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO
YEAH BUT BUT WHOEVER WAS RECRUITING WOULD MORE STAFF DOING IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
MORE STUFF WHAT WOULD ASSIST A LARGE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS ARE MISSED BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CANNOT MOVE DETAINEES FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AS WE NEED TO THAT WOOD AND INEVITABLY INCREASE THE COST OF THE CONTRACT THE HOME OFFICE AND WHETHER THE HOME OFFICE WOULD BE PREPARED TO PAY FOR THAT IS ANOTHER MATTER BUT HE DID DO YOU FEEL THAT
WITH THE ALL THE TALK THE RAYS OF THE THREATS THAT THERE ARE AT THE MOMENT BUT THERE IS AN INCREASED WILLINGNESS IN THE HOME OFFICE TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT NEEDS TO BE SPENT IN THESE AREAS
THERE IS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT SORT OF IMPACT THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE MONEY FOR VERY HIGH PROFILE TYPES AT INTERVENTIONS WE'VE GOT WE'VE STEPPED UP CONTROLS AT THE BORDER AND AT ALL BORDERS BUT IT'S MAINTAINING THAT AT A HIGH LEVEL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND WHETHER THERE IS THE THERE IS THE POLITICAL WILL OR POTENTIALLY EVEN THE NECESSITY TO DO SO
THAT DID IT AND WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL WILL YOU'RE NOT SURE IT IS
EXPERIENCE WOULD FROM THE PAST WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT ISN'T THE INCREASED CHECKS AT THE BORDER LAST ABOUT TWO WEEKS OR THAT'S WHAT LIKE HOW LONG THEY LASTED AFTER THE PARIS ATTACKS WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO LAST THAT LONG BUT THEY LAST FOR LONGER WILL DEPEND ON THINGS LIKE INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED BUT ALSO PUBLIC PERCEPTION
BUT AN INTELLIGENCE RECEIVED IT IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE A RATHER SENSIBLE WAY OF DOING IT MIGHTN'T IT RATHER THAN A SIMPLER KIND OF PANIC STRICKEN CHECKING OF EVERYTHING EVEN WHEN IT'S UTTERLY POINTLESS YOU WOULD ACCEPT WHAT DO YOU THAT THERE ARE SENSIBLE WAYS OF DOING THIS THAT DON'T INVOLVE CHECKING EVER
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S HOW THE BORDER IN THE SECURITY THE BORDER IS MAINTAINED BUT THERE'S ALSO AN ELEMENT OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION AND IT'S NOT WRONG FOR THE POLITICIANS TO SEEK TO MEET THAT WHEN THEY NEED TO LUCY MORTON GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE HIGHEST
IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S GET SOME SPORTS NEWS AND GARY RICHARDSON IS HERE MORNING ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS ARE STILL ON COURSE FOR A SEMI FINAL PLACE IN THE WORLD TWENTY TWENTY THERE NOW PLACE FOR LANKA ON SATURDAY AFTER ONLY JUST MANAGING TO BEAT AFGHANISTAN AT ONE STAGE ENGLAND WERE FIFTY SEVEN FOR SIX WILL SPEAK IN A SHORT TIME AGO ENGLAND'S ASSISTANT COACH PAUL FOR BRYCE HAD THIS TO SAY

MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAMS SEARCHING FOR TWO CLIMBERS ON BEN NEVIS HAVE FOUND THE BODIES OF A MAN AND A WOMAN RACHEL SLATER AND TIM NEWTON FROM BRADFORD IN WEST YORKSHIRE WENT MISSING LAST MONTH
AMERICAN INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED A DRUG SMUGGLING TUNNEL RUNNING FROM A RESTAURANT IN MEXICO UNDER THE BORDER TO A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA THE EXIT FROM THE TUNNEL WAS CONCEALED BY TILES IN THE LIVING ROOM OF A NEWLY BUILT HOME FOR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED
THE TIME THANK YOU FOR THAT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT DO NOT TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IF YOU WANT ENERGY BILLS TO REMAIN STABLE HER VOTE TO LEAVE IS A VOTE FOR ROCKETING PRICES UP BY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR A MASSIVE ELECTRIC SHOCK
AND WORSE PRESIDENT PUTIN COULD RAISE THE PRICE OF RUSSIAN GAS AND WOULD BE RELATIVELY POWERLESS TO STOP HIM WHO ARE OUTSIDE THE E.U. THESE ARE SOME OF THE FEARS RAISED TODAY IN A SPEECH TO BE MADE BY AMBER RUB THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE SECRETARY AND SHE'S ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AS A BIT OF A PLAGUE OF FROGS FEELING TO IT THIS SPEECH TIME OUT I DON'T THINK SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS SET OUT THE REAL EXAMPLES OF THE ADVANTAGES OF STAYING IN AND THAT'S CHEAPER BILLS AND BETTER SECURITY THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THE ANALYSIS DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT
WHO DID IT FOR NATIONAL GRID TO NEUTRAL IN THIS DEBATE AND THEY INVITED THEM TO LOOK AT BOTH SIDES AND SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES WOULD BE FRONT ENERGY MARKET AND WHAT THEY SAID WAS ACTUALLY WAS UNCERTAIN THE IMPACT OF BRECHT'S HAD ON THE U.K. SAYS ABSOLUTELY AND THEY SAID THE COST OF THAT UNCERTAINTY WOULD HAVE FINANCIAL COSTS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY HIGHER BILLS WHICH THEY ESTIMATE WHAT THEY SAID BEHIND ONE HUNDRED MILLION HAVE IT THERE IN SAY WHAT THEY SAID COULD THEY SAID IT COULD IT'S THE RISK THAT THEY WERE ANALYSING AND THEY'VE ANALYSED THAT RISK AND SAID
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AT LEAST AND ALSO WHEN WE ASKED THE NATIONAL GRID ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT THE POSITIVES OF LEAVING
IT COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING AT ALL WHAT ONE OBVIOUS POSITIVE HE'S USED ENERGY PRICES WOULD STAY LOW UNDERLEY THEY EAT YOU CAN COMMISSION ANYWAY WANTS TO RAISE ENERGY PRICES THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT ISN'T THERE BUT PERFECTLY OPEN ABOUT ENERGY PRICES WILL GO UP BECAUSE IN THE VARIOUS RULES AT THE ART ABOUT GREEN ENERGY ETCETERA SO THE IDEA THAT UNDER ONE SETS WE LEAVE ENERGY PRICES IF WE STAY IN
THEY DON'T GO OUT THAT THE STRESS FALLS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT IS THE E.U. INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET IS ABOUT TRADE LIBERALISATION AND COMPETITION THAT'S HOW WE BRING PRICES DOWN AND WE AS THE U.K. ARE LEADERS IN THAT MOAT MODEL AND WE'RE ABLE TO INFLUENCE IT IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG TO SUGGEST THE E.U. WANT HIGHER PRICES NOBODY WANTS HIGHER PRICES ENERGY COS THAT ARISE IN ALL SCENARIOS THAT'S WHAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAID MAY TWENTY THIRTEEN
BUT WHAT WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IS THE COSTS OF HAVING ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WHY DID THOSE AND THERE'S COST AFFECT US IF WE STAY IN HERE THAT'S THE POINT KNOW BUT THE POINT IS JUSTIN WE ALREADY HAVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE ACT WE ALREADY HAVE HIGH STANDARDS THE REQUESTS FROM THE E.U. THE E.U. DIRECTIVES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY ARE ONLY ON TOP OF A CLIMATE CHANGE ACT AND WHEN THE OPPOSITION WHEN THEY LEAVE US OUR BILLS WOULD COME DOWN BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ADOPT THESE GREEN ENERGY TARGET
THEY'RE COMPLETELY WRONG WE ALREADY HAVE THE U.K. CLIMATE CHANGE ACT WHICH WAS PASSED IN THIS WE COULD CHANGE HER MIND THAT'S THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD DO IF WE WERE OUT OF THE EUROPEAN WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY WE WOULD STICK WITH THOSE RULES WE COULD CHANGE YOUR MIND NO I THINK YOU'RE MAKING AN ASSUMPTION WHICH IS THIS WE CAME OUT OF THE E.U. WE WOULD SOMEHOW REPEAL THE U.K. CLIMATE CHANGE THERE MIKE
BUT THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ARGUMENT IF THEY LEAVE US ARE SAYING WE SHOULD REPAY ALL THE U.K. CLIMATE CHANGE THEY SHOULD SAY SO AND THEN EXPLAIN HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE INVESTMENT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND IT ON HOW MANY NEW COAL FIRED POWER STATIONS THEY MIGHT BUILD WHAT WERE ONE THING THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IS CALLED NOT BUILD THE HINKLEY C. BECAUSE THEY WERE PART OF THE YEAR DO YOU MAKE THE POINT ABOUT PRICES TODAY UPON THE POINT ABOUT PRICES WE ARE HAVING TO PAY THESE HIGH PRICES INCLUDING THE HIGH
PRICE THAT WE WOULD PAY IF HINKLEY C. HE'S EVER PAID BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENTS TO THOSE E.U. RULES NO IT'S NOT THE COMMITMENT TO THE E.U. RULES IT'S THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE U.K. CLIMATE CHANGE ACT THAT WAS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY IN PARLIAMENT ACROSS PARTIES ONLY HAD FIVE M.P.S VOTING AGAINST IT THE U.K. ITSELF IS COMMITTED TO CLEAN SECURE ENERGY AND THE U.K. CLIMATE CHANGE THAT GUARANTEES THAT WHAT WE WANT TO STICK YOU TO DO THE SAME BECAUSE THEN WE INCREASE COMPETITIVENESS
FOR ENERGY PRICES AND FOR BUSINESSES QUICK ONE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN YOU MENTION TODAY HOW MUCH HAVE OUR GASSED AWAY AN IMPORT FROM RUSSIA VERY LITTLE OF OUR GAS WE IMPORT FROM RUSSIA THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT THE REPORT SAYS AND WHAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT IN THE LONG TERM GAS FROM RUSSIA WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN SECURITY IN EUROPE AND ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN MARKET TO THE INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET IT'S HOW WE KEEP PRICES DOWN WE CANNOT IGNORE WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINK SO I DON'T DROP IN THEN WE IMPORT MOST OF OUR GAS DON'T WE FROM NORWAY
A THIRD FROM NOWHERE IT ABOUT A THIRD FORM LIQUID NATURAL GAS AND ABOUT A THIRD FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE PLATE AND A HUGE AMOUNT ABOUT TO BE SUPPLIED FROM AMERICA WAS JUST THAT STARTED TO EXPORT GAZ HASN'T IT AND SOMETHING SOMEBODY'S GOING TO COME HERE SO WHY WAS RUSSIA WHY IS WHY IS VLADIMIR PUTIN SUDDENLY A PROBLEM FOR US IF WE LEAVE THE BECAUSE RUSSIA IMPORT EXPORT A LOT OF GAS TO THE REST OF EUROPE WE ACCESSED A GASSED THROUGH EUROPE AND BY TWENTY THIRTEEN NORWAY MOST
NORWAY IS IN EUROPE I WAS NOT OPINION MEANT ENTIRE INTO INSIDE THE INTERNAL ENERGY MARKET NO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE
NO WAIT INSIDE THE INTERNAL ENGINE MARKET SO IT ACCEPTS ALL THE RULES OF THE E.U. WITHOUT OF COURSE BEING ABLE TO INFLUENCE BUT MY POINT IS IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER IN OR OUT DOES IT WE'RE NOT I MEAN YOU'RE FLOODING IT PUTIN WANTS HER BEHAVE BADLY HE'LL BEHAVE BADLY WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A GAS ELSEWHERE WHERE WE'RE FREE TO DO THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND THERE IS A LOT OF GAS AROUND AFTER ON INCLUDING ALL THAT FRANK GAS FROM AMERICA THERE IS A LOT OF GAS AROUND FOR NOW AND BY THE TWENTY THIRTIES WE EXPECT TO BE IMPORTING THREE QUARTERS OF OUR GAS BUT THE THING ABOUT THE GAS MARKET IS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHOCKS AND WHAT CHANGES THERE CAN BE TO IT
IN JAPAN AFTER THE FUKUSHIMA INCIDENTS THE AND G. MARKET FOR GAS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE ALL HAD TO GO TO JAPAN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STRANGE THEY'RE A PEW TIN DOES USED GAS AS AND FOREIGN ENERGY POLICY WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT AND WORK WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT WORKING TOGETHER AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IT'S HOW WE CAN STAND UP TO HIM ON HINKLEY POINT I DO WILL YOU EVEN AT THIS LATE STAGE ENTERTAIN THE IDEA BINNING IT
NO WE WON'T WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT HE HINKLEY POINT WILL GO AHEAD IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF SECURE LOW CARBON ELECTRICITY IN THE FUTURE AND INVESTING IN NUCLEAR IS WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS ALL ABOUT IN TERMS OF PLANNING FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS IT IS HUGELY EXPENSIVE THERE ISN'T IT WELL IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU COMPARE IT TO WHOLESALE PRICES ARE VERY LOW BUT IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE IT TO WHAT IT WOULD COST TO BUILD
ONSHORE WIND OFFSHORE WIND OR EVEN A NEW GAS IT'S WITHIN THE SAME RANGE SO NO I DON'T ACCEPT IT'S HUGELY EXPENSIVE INTERESTED YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE WE WOULD BE GUARANTEEING A PAYMENT WELL WELL WHATEVER ABOVE CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICES TO E.D.F. FOR A PAIR IN AN INDEX LINKED
FOR A LONG PERIOD TO COME AND THAT IS A PAYMENT THAT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY ISN'T IT AND THE POINT THAT PEOPLE MAKE IS NUMBER ONE THAT IT'S TOO HIGH A LUMP TO THAT THIS IS UNTRIED TECHNOLOGY THAT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE BUILT IN TIME AND THAT THE WHOLE THING IS JUST TOO RISKY AND I'M INTERESTED IN HOW CONFIDENT YOU ARE THIS MORNING THAT THOSE CASES FED WELL
DON'T FORGET WE DON'T STOP PAYING FOR THAT ELECTRICITY UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT THE CONSTRUCTION RISK IS NOT ON ASS IS ON E.D.F. SECONDLY WHO KNOWS WHAT THE PRICES WILL BE IN THE TWENTY THIRTIES ON THE TWENTY FORTIES THEY ALL LOW NOW BUT THERE WAS A WHOLESALE PRICES THEY'RE NOT THE PRICES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND THEY'RE NOT FOR LOW CARBON SECURE BASE LOAD NUCLEAR IS AN IMPORTANT PART IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
NO CARBON ELECTRICITY IN THERE BUT THERE ARE OTHER NUCLEAR THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT THERE ARE MODULAR NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS OR ARE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE SMALLER SCALE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING HOW QUICKER AS WELL AND THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE ARE COMMITTED AS WELL TO DOING US IT'S NOT JUST ONE NUCLEAR REACTOR WE'RE HAVING A WHOLE NUCLEAR PLAN OVER THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AT S. MILES ARE PART OF THAT IN A VERY MUCH SUPPORTED BY THE CHANCELLOR
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH HINKLEY POINT OBVIOUSLY IS WHETHER E.D.F. ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND COME OUT COS NOT ONLY HAVE PEOPLE SUGGESTING THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD A SUGGEST E.D.F. CAN'T AFFORD TO TO GO AHEAD AND BILL ARE YOU REASONABLY PEOPLE ARE TALKING NOW ABOUT MEN THE BOSS OF E.D.F. TALKING ABOUT ME ARE YOU REASONABLY CONVINCED HOW CONVINCED ARE YOU THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET A FINAL DECISION THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE NEXT MONTH
I'M COMPLETELY CONFIDENT THAT HINKLEY POINT WILL BE GOING AHEAD THE TIMING IS FOR E.D.F. AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO CONCLUDE IT DOES MATTER TO ASK THE TIMING DOESN'T IT BECAUSE IT GETS PUT OFF MUCH LONGER GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THIS TYPE OF NUCLEAR REACTOR TENDS TO OVER RUN IN ITS BUILDING ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF TOUCH I REPEAT WE DON'T STOP PAYING FOR THE ELECTRICITY UNTIL THEY BUILT IT WE NEED THE ELECTRICITY THAT'S THE POINT INDEED WE DO IT SO WE WILL ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SECURE SUPPLIES IT'S NOT DUE TO COME ON NIGEL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH GIVES A SUFFICIENT TIME TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO SECURE ELECTRICITY IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND BEYOND IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY DELAYS WHICH I HOPE THERE WON'T BE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW NINETY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND WHAT IS THE RIGHT RESPONSE TO THE CARNAGE IN BRUSSELS THE TIMES CALLS FOR A HARD FIGHT AGAINST RADICALISATION AT HOME AND ABROAD YOUNG OFFENDERS IT SAYS MUST BE KEPT APART FROM KNOWN RADICALS TABS MUST BE KEPT ON PRISONERS AFTER THEY'RE RELEASED EXPRESS THINKS WE SHOULD LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP ESPECIALLY HIS COMMENTS THAT MUSLIMS HAVE FAILED TO TURN IN TERROR SUSPECTS
IT SAYS PASSIVELY TOLERATING THE PRESENCE OF EXTREMISTS IN OUR MIDST WERE LEAD TO DISASTER AT THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS THE ONLY WAY TO BEAT EVIL KILLERS IS TO JOIN TOGETHER THE TELEGRAPH BELIEVES THE TIME HAS COME FOR A DRAMATIC OVERHAUL OF EUROPEAN SECURITY PROCEDURES SOMETHING THE U.S. AND BRITAIN HAVE BOTH ALREADY DONE THE GUARDIAN'S ANGRY WITH THOSE WHO SAY OUR SECURITY WOULD BE BETTER IF WE LEFT THE E.U. IT COR SUCH TALK CHEAP AND DANGEROUS AND LOOKS INSTEAD FOR SOLIDARITY AND CO OPERATION
DAILY MAIL ARGUES THAT INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED WITHOUT ALLOWING UNELECTED AND UNACCOUNTABLE FOREIGNERS TO DICTATE OUR LORD A SLOGAN CAN MAKE A POLITICIAN OR AS THE TIMES POINTS OUT UNDO HER REPUTATION THE PAPER REFLECTS ON THE REVERSE SUFFERED BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER WHO CHOSE THE PHRASE FOR HIS CAMPAIGN CONTINUITY AND CHANGE WHICH TURNED OUT TO COME FROM THE TERRIBLE AMERICAN T. V. SHOW THE PAPER THINKS THEIR BACK CATALOGUE OF GARETH'S IS BIG AND WORTH RECALLING WILLIAM KELLY RAN FOR PRESIDENT IT SAYS ON THE SLOGAN A FULL DINNER PAIL
IN BRITAIN ARTHUR BALFOUR CHOSE THE PHRASE HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THEN SAYS THE TIMES WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT OR MICHAEL HOWARD ARE YOU THINKING WHAT WHERE I THINK
STRANGE GOINGS ON IN AN ESSEX VILLAGE A REPORT IN THE TELEGRAPH THE PAPER SAYS RESIDENTS OF BLACKMORE ARE BAFFLED BY THE ACTIONS OF VANDALS SOMEONE'S BEEN PAINTING OUT THE NAME OF THE VILLAGE ON EVERY ROAD SIGN IN THE AREA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARISH COUNCIL SAYS NO ONE CAN FATHOM WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND DECLINE IN SALES OF G. STRINGS BY MARKS AND SPENCER'S AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE SUN IS NOT PREPARED TO FOREGO ALONG WITH PLENTY OF PICTURES
THE PAPER SAYS THE BOTTOM'S FALLEN OUT OF THE THONGS MY HEADLINE OF COURSE BUT HAVE THEIR MOMENTS I THINK THEY'RE KLEIN SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S GET THE LATEST FROM BRUSSELS TWO DAYS AFTER THE BOMBING ATTACKS THERE OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICES IN THE PLACE DE LA BOUGHT IN THE CENTRE WHICH HAD BECOME THE FOCUS OF TRIBUTES SINCE TUESDAY MATTHEW GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING SARAH BRUSSELS HAS A BIT MORE OF A BUSTLING FEEL THIS MORNING PARENTS ARE TAKING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL
THERE'S A STREET SWEEPER YOU CAN PROBABLY HEAR THAT'S JUST COMING ROUND QUITE CLOSE TO ME AT THE MOMENT OFFICE WORKERS HEADING TO WORK AND TO THE STATIONS ARE JUST PART OF THE CENTRAL STATION HERE THERE ARE ARMY LORRIES OUTSIDE AND TROOPS OUTSIDE ON GUARD AS WELL
A REMINDER OF THE SITUATION THE CITY FINDS ITSELF IN BUT IT IS BUSIER THAN YESTERDAY WHEN ARGUABLY THERE WAS MORE OF A SOMBRE MOOD AND IT WAS YESTERDAY THAT WE SPOKE ON THIS PROGRAMME TO A YOUNG MUSLIM WOMAN CALLED ASTHMA SHE LIVES IN THE MODERN BAKE PART OF BRUSSELS WHICH HAS A BAD REPUTATION OF BEING HOME TO SOME OF THE ATTACKER CERTAINLY IN THE PARIS ATTACKS AND IT MAY WELL HAVE LINKS TO THESE LATEST ATTACKS
I CAUGHT UP WITH ASTHMA AGAIN IN A CAFE IN MODERN BAKE TO ASK HER AND OTHERS WHY THEY THINK YOUNG MUSLIMS ARE BEING RADICALISED
AN AMAZING COUNTER WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE MY FAVOURITE IS THIS IS THEM
IT'S A GREAT CITY GREAT SMELL IN HERE OF SHOCK EACH OTHER YOU AND IT'S CALLED BECAUSE NORMALLY WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S NOT HER AND HE DID IT FOR US
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I WALKED IN HERE BECAUSE I'M IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PINE FLOORBOARDS AND PINE TABLES AND IT LOOKS VERY CHICKS SHE GABRIELLE YEAH THIS DOESN'T FIT THE IMAGE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT ONE
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS I'VE GONE THROUGH WITH WHAT IS IT DON'T KNOW I DON'T REALLY EXIST
YOU NOTICED WHEN YOU CAME HERE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE CANAL SO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL THAT I CROSSED OVER
MUCH CLOSER TO THE CENTRE AGAIN LIKE WALKED BY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL IT'S WELL IT'S NOT AS DIVERSE AS THIS PEOPLE ARE LIKE BLAMING GOES FOR A LIVING WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH CREATING BAD IF I WON THE RAND CHARLES POORER HOUSE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CANAL I HAVE TO
HEAVEN'S HIGH CELERY AND MY NAME IS GOING TO BE IN THERE ARE BIDS TO BEING ON THE CONTRACT
LET'S JUST STEP INSIDE HERE THE FISHMONGER NOW WONDERFUL SMELL OF FISH IN HERE CALAMARI PRAWNS ON SALE LOT OF FISH ON ICE AS A COUPLE LADIES DOING THEIR SHOPPING AND
THEY DON'T WANT TO ANSWER ANY OF MY QUESTIONS BUT THE MOMENT ASTHMA ASKED THEM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WE'VE GOT A WHOLE RANGE YOU CAN DO WITH YOU ARE YOU SHOULD BE WHY THESE ATTACKS HAPPENING IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION SHE SAYS IT'S ABOUT THE POLITICAL SITUATION IT'S ABOUT THESE YOUNG MEN BEING USED BY GROUPS LIKE ISIS TO FURTHER THEIR OWN POLITICAL AIMS
THERE'S ANOTHER MAN JUST COME INTO THE FISHMONGER'S HERE IF I CAN ASK YOU A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S ABOUT POLITICS A LOT OF PEOPLE'S
IT'S ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE FEELING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A STAKE IN THIS SOCIETY BUT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THOSE JUST SOUND LIKE EXCUSES
YOU KNEEL BIRDS CALL OUR AS GO WITH A JOB YOU COULD YOU GO AND MELT SO HE SAYS THAT FROM HIS EYES AS WHATEVER YOU WERE ASKING FOR HER WAS THE REASON IT'S MAYBE THE BACKGROUND IT WAS THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEY WERE CUTE AND
LET'S WORK AND FOCUS ON THE REAL PROBLEM STOP FOCUSING ON ME CRUEL PROBLEM
AFTER ATTACKS LIKE WE SAW ON TUESDAY THE STEREOTYPING WILL GET WORSE PRESUMABLY DO YOU THINK THAT FEEDS IN TO THE RADICALISATION OF SOME PEOPLE
I DON'T THINK IT'S CONFUSED BUT I THINK YOU CAN HELP THEM IN THEIR COMFORT ZONE OF THEY HATE THE GOVERNMENT HATERS SO WHATEVER I DO THEY DESERVE
IT'S EASY FOR THE RECRUITERS FROM JESUS TO PLAY ON THERE TO GAME THEY GIVE THEM A GALL TO THEIR MISERY SO THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE HEROES AND THERE ARE JUST ZEROS HECHT IS JUST ONE OF THE CHEFS LITTLE
MATTHEW PRICE REPORTING FROM MONARCH AND BRUSSELS TIME IS THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND OUR OXFORD STUDIO THIS MORNING IS CANON ANGELA TILL BE OF CHRISTCHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD MORNING GOOD MORNING JUST INTO ONE AND SARAH THIS IS THE SEASON FOR SACRED MUSIC AND THE PASSIONS OF BARK ARE ALWAYS A GREAT DRAW
AT LEAST SIX PERFORMANCES OF THE SAINT MATTHEW PASSION BEING OFFERED IN LONDON ALONE AROUND EASTER SOME OF THEM SOLD OUT WELL IN ADVANCE WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL I OFTEN WENT TO THE ROYAL FESTIVAL HALL ON GOOD FRIDAY TO HEAR THIS GREAT WORK ALWAYS PERFORMED WITHOUT APPLAUSE FOR SACRED WORK FOR A SACRED DAY
MY TEENAGE SELF WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE DRAMA OF IT ALL THE SHATTERING MOMENT WHEN THE CHORUS SANG OUT THE DISSONANT BAR A BUS MARKING THE CONDEMNATION OF JESUS THE HEARTBREAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL ARIAS THE SOLEMN CORRALS WHICH GATHERED UP THE STORY IN THE LANGUAGE OF HYMNODY
BUT MY FAVOURITE MOMENT IN THE WHOLE WORK IS THE BEGINNING OF THE FINAL CHORUS THERE'S AN ORCHESTRAL INTRODUCTION AND THEN SOMETHING A BIT UNEXPECTED HAPPENS I CHECK THIS OUT OF MUSICAL COLLEAGUES AT CHRIST CHURCH WHO EXPLAINED IT TO ME THERE'S A CORD BEFORE THE CHORUS COMES IN WITH A RISING RUN OF NOTES IN THE BASELINE JUST AT THE MOMENT FROM THE CHOIR ARE TAKING BREATH
THE LAST NOTE FROM THE ORCHESTRA IS A SINGLE QUAVER THAT SEEMS BOTH OUT OF PLACE AT THE MOMENT YOU HEAR IT AND PERFECTLY RIGHT ONCE THE CHOIR COME IN
IT'S ALWAYS SUGGESTED TO ME AND ANTICIPATION THERE CAN HARDLY BE BORN LIKE THE TOP OF A WAVE IN THE SPLIT SECOND BEFORE IT TUMBLES OVER IT SENT SHIVERS DOWN MY SPINE JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT I THINK BACH WAS A COMPOSER WHOSE MUSIC DOESN'T JUST ILLUSTRATE THE CHRISTIAN FAITH AND SOMEWHERE IT ACTUALLY PERFORMS IT
WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTERESTING BUT JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH WAS SUCH AN AWKWARD CHARACTER CAPABLE OF DISHONESTY PRICKLY AND COMPLAINING SOME OF THOSE WHO EMPLOYED HIM FOR HIS TALENT FOUND HIM TO BE A NIGHTMARE
THERE'S A STORY OF HIM IN A REHEARSAL TUGGING OFF HIS WIG AND STAMPING ON IT WITH RAGE AT LEAST ONE OF HIS BIOGRAPHERS HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE REASON THE SAINT MATTHEW PASSION IS SO DRAMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IS THAT BUT POURED HIS BITTERLY UNRESOLVED EXPERIENCE INTO THE WORK
IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH HE WAS BACH LIVED AND DIED A FERVENT CHRISTIAN BELIEVER
THE SAINT MATTHEW PASSION TELLS US WHAT WE KNOW THAT CONFLICT FURY VIOLENCE HEARTBREAK AND GRIEF ARE INESCAPABLE IN THIS LIFE
AT THE SAME TIME BACH WAS ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS A RESOLUTION THAT IN ALL THIS HUMAN MISERY THE LOVE AND JUSTICE OF GOD SHINES THROUGH AND WILL FINALLY BE VINDICATED
ICE OF SIN IS PAID IN FULL
GOODNESS TRUMPS EVIL BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S MORE INTERESTING MORE ATTRACTIVE MORE PLAUSIBLE MORE INTELLIGENT
BUT WE HAVE TO LEARN THIS AND EXPERIENCE WE MORTAL STILL STAND ON THE CREST OF THAT BRIEF LEADING NOTE SUSPENDED ON THE UNEXPECTED QUAVER BEFORE WE OVERCOME IN THE CHORUS OF THE FINAL RESOLUTION
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CANNON ANGELA TILL THEY HAVE CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL OXFORD THE TIMES TEND TO EIGHT THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL IN THE HAGUE WILL GIVE ITS JUDGEMENT THIS AFTERNOON ON WHETHER THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RADHA VAN CARRIED ITCH IS GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY HE WAS FIRST INDICTED FOR WAR CRIMES BY THE UNITED NATIONS TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO PLEADING FOR HIS ROLE IN THE STRIP AND IT'S A MASSACRE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE MY CARRIED ITCH HAS SAID HE HAS A CLEAR CONSCIENCE
OUR CORRESPONDENT AND A METAL SPOKE TO COMMAND PER VAN ITCHIN SARAJEVO HE'S A SURVIVOR OF THE MASK A CONCENTRATION CAMP RUN BY BOSNIAN SERB FORCES IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE BOSNIAN WAR IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HE WAS BORN IN BOSNIA AND WE SPENT AND HE WAS HOLDING HIS CLASS PHOTO FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE IT SHOULD A CLASS OF MIXED ETHNICITY AND RELIGION
THERE ARE MORE THAN THIRTY OF US IN THIS PICTURE AND MORE THAN HALF
OR THE PEOPLE IN THIS PICTURE WERE EITHER KILLED OR HAVE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS
ONE OF THE DO YOUR THINGS FOR YOU IS THAT AMONG THOSE
IMPRISONED WITH YOU WERE SOME OF YOUR CLASSMATES BUT ALSO SOME OF THOSE CLASSMATES WERE THEMSELVES PERPETRATE
SOME OF MY CLASSMATES WERE MY PRISON GUARDS MY HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER WAS MY INTERROGATOR AND MY TORCH
I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS PLACE AND
I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE THAT I WOULD END UP IN THE SAME ROOM SO WHEN I SAW HIM IN THERE I'M SURE
BECAUSE YOU NEVER EXPECT YOUR TEACHER
TO BE IN A PLACE LIKE THAT IT WAS AN ESPECIALLY THIS GUY WE LOCKED HIM SHE WAS SUCH A POPULAR TEACHER HE WAS VERY NICE TO US
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT TORTURED CHILLED WOMEN OF OVARY
AND I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THIS HAPPENING JUST BEHIND THE WALL OF THE ROOM WHICH I WAS
SO IT WAS A LIVING HEALTH WHEN I WENT BACK TO BOSNIA TEN YEARS AFTER I WAS TAKEN TO THE OSCAR I WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIM
AT NO POINT WAS HE PREPARED TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE THINGS BUT IRONICALLY AWAY HE ASKED ME TO FORGIVE HIM
I I COULDN'T FORGIVE HIM OF THE TIME I DID FORGIVE HIM AFTER HE DIED I FORGIVE ALL OF THESE BUT HE DIED TWO YEARS LATER SO I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ME AGAIN BUT TODAY I WORK WITH HIS SON AND WHAT DOES THAT WORK
WE TRY TO WE TRY TO BUILD PEACE TOGETHER AND
HIS SON IS DEDICATED TO PROMOTE HIM TO TRUTH
OF THOSE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN L. TORN BETWEEN NINETY TWO AND NINETY FIVE
SO FOR ME IT'S A SIGN THAT IT'S NOT JUST MY PERSONAL OPTIMISM
I CAN SEE IN MY TEACHERS' SONS K.'S THAT THEY'VE A GOOD REASONS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE
COME AAB HER BANNACH TALKING DOWN A LITTLE MORE ROBERT DON YOU WROTE A BIOGRAPHY OF RADHA VAN CAO EDITION WAS CALLED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION IN HIS TRIAL IN TWENTY TEN I SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE MAN AT THE CENTRE OF THE CASE HE WAS ME VERY UNREMARKABLE MAN OPENED
ABOUT FORTY FIVE IN NINETEEN NINETY IN SHARP CHURNED INTO NATIONAL POLITICS
WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE ORGANISER AND POPULIST LEADER
WAS ALSO RICH WHY HANNAH SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE WAR
CRIMES WERE ACTUALLY RESULTED ONE HAVING CLIENTS AT WORK
ARRANGED FOR
SO YOU WOULD SAY HE WAS DIRECTLY GUILTY OF THE CRIMES THAT HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF AN EGG I WOULD SAY HE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS
THE EVIDENCE FOR THERE HE WAS OFTEN VERY CAREFUL TO
THE SEPARATE THE WIND WOULD YOU CRY WHEN HE WAS ORDERING THIS BUT THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE
HE WAS NOT ONCE SET IT IN MOTION AND BEHIND THE EXECUTION OF THE VERY ASTUTE AT WORK
THEY HAD A RATHER STRANGE SITUATION OF BEING CROSS EXAMINED BY HIM IN COURT BECAUSE HE WAS REPRESENTING HIMSELF WHAT WAS THAT LIKE THIS WHEN I ASKED TWENTY HOURS
HE WAS BASICALLY RAISING GOOD FENCE WHICH WAS HISTORICAL IN NATURE
SO HE WAS INTERESTED IN TRYING TO CREATE HISTORICAL
THE PROSECUTION OF THAT SIR
HE SAW HIMSELF AS THE VICTIM OF THE SAME FORCES THAT WERE PRESSED SERVANTS YOU OBVIOUSLY
SO OUR DISCUSSIONS CENTRE I'M HERE I'M A VERY EVIL AT THE WAR LEADING UP TO THE WAR
THE CHARACTER OF THOSE E.P.S. HE WHY DID DESCRIBE THE WOLE IS FIRST TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE SERBS
I USUALLY SORT OF IN A MUCH MORE BALANCED WEIGHT YEAH
MANY CASES WHY IS SERVE LEADERS DO YOU ARRANGE FOR A SEIZURE OF POWER BY MEANS OF MORE ONCE APPARENTLY
WAS HE EFFECTIVE IN DEFENDING HIMSELF I THINK HE WAS A BACK TO YOU IN MANY WAYS IT WAS A CROSS EXAMINER IS CERTAINLY WAS
WELL IN SHOREHAM MUST START A CALL VERY BRIGHT LEADER
IT WAS A CROSS MOTHER I'VE COURSE DISAGREED WITH SO MANY POINTS
THEN BECAME A MATTER OF WHO HAD
IT'S JUST SUPPORT YOUR PROJECT
SO NOW OF COURSE WE COME TO THE JUDGEMENT OR JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER HE WAS GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AND WAR CRIMES IF YOU WERE TO CALL IT NOW WHAT WAY WOULD YOU SAY IT WOULD GO
WHY DIDN'T YOU WE CAN DO OH YEAH THE EAST SIDE
WE COUNT IN THE INDICTMENT THAT TO
I ALWAYS WAS AND CUSTOMS OF WAR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY
JANET'S SIDE IT WILL BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE JUDGES TO ACCEPT YES BROUGHAM CHIPPED THERE WILL BE THE FIRST
WHICH ALLEGES THAT CLEAN I LIKE THAT A GENOCIDE THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO
THE SECOND ONE WHICH CONCERNS ASIDE IT'S FEBRUARY NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD JUST BECOME THIS NO OR THE WAR CRIMES THAT TIME THERE'S BEFORE
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LIKE WISEMAN'S GUILTY NO PLANNING AND HERRING ARE NOW SO I'M REASONABLY
STICK THAT THERE WILL RESULT EVER NO YOU'LL DIE JUDGEMENT IS
DO YOU THINK HE HAS NO IDEA OF HIS OWN GUILT THEN NO I THINK HE'S A MAN WHO'S VERY GOOD AT PERSUADING OTHERS DELUDING HIMSELF ROBERT DUNYA THANK YOU VERY MUCH

A NEW SERIES OF CROSSING CONTINENTS THE HUMAN STORIES BEHIND INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES UP HIGH SILHOUETTED AGAINST A WIDE BLUE SKY VULTURES
MIRROR TOO OFTEN PERHAPS BY THOSE HAPPY TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO FEET ON THE PUBLIC
CURRENT AFFAIRS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE THESE COMMUNITY AS BEING UTTERLY NEGLECTED BY GOVERNMENT
FORMALLY PERSECUTED HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED
BIG TIME POLITICS CROSSING CONTINENTS RETURNS THIS MORNING AT ELEVEN ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR
JUST TIME TO SAY NOW THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOYLE SIR MONTAGUE AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TWENTY FOURTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING SOURCES IN BRUSSELS SAY ONE OF THE JIHADIST TO ATTACK THE CITY'S AIRPORT WAS A MAN SUSPECTED OF HAVING MADE THE BOMBS USED IN THE PARROTS OR TANKS IN NOVEMBER THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER OUT OF ONE CARRIAGE ITCH WE WILL LEARN TODAY WHETHER AN INTERNATIONAL COURT HAS FOUND HIM GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND NEW ZEALAND HAS VOTED TO KEEP ITS CURRENT FLAG
THE NEWS READ BY NEIL SLEET OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ONE OF THE JIHADISTS WHO ATTACKED THE CITY'S AIRPORT WAS THE MAN SUSPECTED OF HAVING MADE THE BOMBS USED IN LAST NOVEMBER'S ASSAULT ON PARIS
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS SAY D.N.A. EVIDENCE HAS LINKS TO BOTH THE ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND PARIS ONE OF THE SUSPECTS RECORDED ON C. C. T. V. PUSHING TROLLEYS THROUGH THE AIRPORT A MAN WEARING A HAT AND WHITE COAT REMAINS AT LARGE IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
THE SEARCH FOR THE THIRD MAN IN THE C.C.T.V. IMAGES THE IMMEDIATE FOCUS OF A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION HE WAS CARRYING THE MOST POWERFUL BOMB OF ALL BUT AFTER HE FLED FROM THE AIRPORT IT FAILED TO GO OFF UNTIL AFTER THE DEPARTURES OWN HAD BEEN EVACUATED FINDING HIM COULD BE THE KEY TO UNRAVELLING OTHER PARTS OF THE NETWORK OF VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THAT CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK
TWO OF THE SUICIDE BOMBERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED AS THE BROTHERS BRAHIM AND HALLEY BACK CRY WE FRENCH AND BELGIAN MEDIA REPORTS QUOTE OFFICIAL'S SAYING THE OTHER SUICIDE BOMB AT THE AIRPORT WAS NADIM LASH FOR A WEEK WHO WAS ALSO SUSPECTED OF MAKING THE SUICIDE VESTS USED IN THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST NOVEMBER
NASH IS JUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF LINKS EMERGING BETWEEN THE EVENTS IN PARIS AND BRUSSELS TODAY'S REPORTS NOT OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED SUGGEST THAT HE'S NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM D.N.A. TRACES FOUND AT THE AIRPORT
AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES Y. YOU INTERIOR MINISTERS ARE MEETING IN EMERGENCY SESSION LATER IN THE DAY TO DISCUSS THE URGENT NEED FOR BETTER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND SHARING ISSUES THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR SOME TIME
THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON HAS SAID THE TERROR THREAT SHOWS THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO BE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WAS SPEAKING AFTER A FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE ARGUED THAT A BRITISH EXIT COULD LEAD TO IMPORTANT SECURITY GAINS FOR THE U.K. BUT THE FORMER HEAD OF G.C.H.Q. SIR DAVID ORMOND HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE U.K. WOULD BE THE LOSER IN SECURITY TERMS IF IT LEFT THE E. YOU HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE BRUSSELS BOMBING HAS HEIGHTENED THE INTENSITY OF THE SECURITY DEBATE OVER BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. BUT TODAY THE FORMER HEAD OF M. I. SIX DELIVERS A WITHERING ASSESSMENT OF BRUSSELS BASED SECURITY BODIES WHICH SHE SAYS ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE SAYS EUROPOL YE E. USE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CONSISTS OF TWENTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF VASTLY VARYING LEVELS OF PROFESSIONALISM IN INTELLIGENCE AND THAT ITS MEETINGS MUST ACCOMMODATE THE SLOWEST AND LEAKY EST SHIP
INTELLIGENCE SHARING HE ARGUES IS MUCH BETTER CONDUCTED ON A BI LATERAL BASIS AND THERE WOULD HE SAYS BE NO DAMAGE TO THE U.K.'S CLOSE SECURITY TIES WITH THE U.S. BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE HOWEVER LAST NIGHT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON SAID THE BRUSSELS BOMBING DEMONSTRATED THE NEED FOR EVEN GREATER CO OPERATION BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS WHAT IS NOW SLOWLY HAPPENING WHICH IS ALL THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND THE SECURITY FORCES ACROSS EUROPE
BEGINNING TO PULL MORE OF THEIR INFORMATION TO HELP EACH OTHER TO SWAP DATA ABOUT MOVEMENTS AIR TRAFFIC MOVEMENTS AND SO ON AND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE CAN BENEFIT FROM MY FALLON ALSO POINTED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT AND SHARED FLIGHT INFORMATION AND HE SAID BECAUSE BRITAIN WAS NOT PART OF THE USE SHOWING AN AREA FOR YOU KAY WAS ALREADY ABLE TO POLICE ITS OWN BORDERS
A REPORT ON THE DEPORTATION OF FOREIGN OFFENDERS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM THE U.K. HAS REVEALED THAT FORTY PERCENT OF ALL PLANNED REMOVALS HAVE TO BE CANCELLED THE STUDY BY THE INDEPENDENT CHIEF INSPECTOR OF BORDERS AND IMMIGRATION DAVID BOULT PARTLY BLAMES HER LACK OF STAFF TO ESCORT DETAIL AND HE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY IS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT DURING AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD ENDING IN JUNE LAST YEAR ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AIRLINE TICKETS HAD TO BE CANCELLED FOR REMOVAL FLIGHTS FOR PEOPLE ILLEGALLY IN THE U.K. THE REPORT SAID THAT WAS MAINLY DUE TO LATE LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THOSE SCHEDULED FOR DEPORTATION
BUT IT FOUND THAT ANOTHER MAJOR CONSTRAINT WAS THE LACK OF SECURITY STAFF ARE REMOVAL FLIGHTS THE PRIVATE COMPANY TESCO OR WHICH HAS THE CONTRACT TO PROVIDE STAFF WAS ONLY ABLE TO DO SO ON AVERAGE FIFTEEN DAYS LATER THAN REQUESTED
THE HOME OFFICE SAID IT WAS DRAWING UP A NEW CONTRACT AND WAS WORKING TO REDUCE CANCELLED AND FAILED REMOVALS HOWEVER INSPECTOR SAID THE DEPARTMENT HAD FAILED TO ACT ON ONE OF THEIR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO REMOVE OVERSEAS STUDENTS WHOSE VISAS HAD EXPIRED OR BEEN CANCELLED
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA'S DUE TO RETURN ITS VERDICT TODAY IN THE CASE OF THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RAAVAN CARRIAGE ITCH ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR FIGURES TO BE TRIED HE'S ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY DURING THE BLOODY ETHNIC WAR IN THE BALKANS FROM NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED BEFORE AN AMERICAN BROKERED PEACE DEAL BROUGHT THE CONFLICT TO AN END OUR CORRESPONDENT PAUL ADAMS WHO COVERED THE WAR REPORTS FROM THE HAGUE
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAR CRIMES TRIALS SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE BOTTOM MILOSEVIC THE LAST PRESIDENT OF YUGOSLAVIA DIED DURING HIS TRIAL HERE TEN YEARS AGO
THE QUESTION TODAY IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH MY CARRIAGE EJ WHO WAS BOTH PRESIDENT AND SUPREME MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE BREAKAWAY BOSNIAN SERB REPUBLIC DIRECTED A POLICY OF ETHNIC CLEANSING WHICH FORCED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NON SERBS FROM THEIR HOMES
MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND MUSLIMS CIVILIANS WERE KILLED AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND OF THEM IN THE MASSACRES THAT FOLLOWED THE FALL OF THE TOWN OF STRIP IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND MANY OTHERS WERE RAPED TORTURED AND IMPRISONED
IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED ON THE EVE OF TODAY'S VERDICT MY CARRIAGE IT'S DENIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THIS
HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE HAS ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF TREATING DISABLED PEOPLE AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND SIMPLY NOT DISCHARGING ITS RESPONSIBILITY IN A REPORT TO THE EQUALITY ACT TWENTY TENANT DISABILITY COMMITTEE SAYS LAWS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION SIMPLY AREN'T WORKING IN PRACTICE IS A DISABILITY CORRESPONDENT NICKY FOX
AFTER A WEEK WHERE DISABILITY HAS HIT THE HEADLINES THE GOVERNMENT IS ONCE AGAIN IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS TIME CRITICISM IS COMING IN THE FORM OF A DAMNING HOUSE OF LORDS REPORT FROM TAXI DRIVERS REFUSING TO TAKE DISABLED PEOPLE TO INACCESSIBLE PUBS AND CLUBS THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT LAWS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION SIMPLY WEREN'T WORKING IN PRACTICE THE DETAILED REPORT HIGHLIGHTS A FAILURE TO ENFORCED CHANGES THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO DISABLED PEOPLE'S LIVES
HE'S ALSO SUGGEST THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE LIFE HARDER THROUGH ITS OWN POLICIES AND REFORMS ONE MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE LADY CAMPBELL SAID MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THEIR REPORT WAS SIMPLE AND COST FREE TO THE TAXPAYER THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS COMMITTED TO ENDING DISCRIMINATION FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND THAT ALL ORGANISATIONS HAVE TO MAKE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS AND THIS IS SOMETHING IT'S CLOSELY MONITORS
TWO OF BRITAIN'S MOST SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER VICTIMS OF ONLINE FRAUD SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE REFUNDED BY BANKS CYBER FRAUD WILL BE ADDED TO OFFICIAL CRIME STATISTICS FROM JULY IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FIGURES BUT SENIOR OFFICERS ARE ASKING WHETHER THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO MORE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES ONLINE TO AVOID BECOMING VICTIMS IN THE FIRST PLACE CRITICS SAY PUTTING THE ONUS ON CITIZENS COULD DISCOURAGE BANKS FROM INVESTING IN SECURITY THEN NANDO REPORTS
THE POLICE SAY EIGHT OUT OF TEN THE CIDER CRIMES COULD BE PREVENTED IF PEOPLE WERE MORE VIGILANT WITH ONLINE SECURITY ACCORDING TO THE TIMES NEWSPAPER SIR BERNARD HOGAN HOWE THE COMMISSIONER OF THE MET POLICE BELIEVE AUTOMATIC COMPENSATION REWARDS BAD BEHAVIOUR WHILE THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR ECONOMIC CRIME COMMANDER CHRIS GREENY OF THE CITY OF LONDON POLICE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CONSIDER SECURITY IN CYBERSPACE HAS MUCH OF A ROUTINE AS LOCKING THEIR FRONT DOOR WHEN THEY GO OUT
AS A POLICE OFFICER IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY WHETHER PEOPLE SHOULD GET REFUND THAT'S A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE CLIENT
BUT IT IS RIGHT I THINK THAT PEOPLE TRY AND TAKE THE BEST STEPS THEY CAN'T BRING THEMSELVES BEING VICTIMS OF CRIME BUT CONSUMER GROUPS ARGUE THAT ENDING AUTOMATIC COMPENSATION COULD CAUSE HUGE DELAYS IN PAYOUTS AND DISCOURAGE BANKS FROM INVESTING IN ONLINE SECURITY THEMSELVES
IN NEW ZEALAND PRELIMINARY RESULTS IN A REFERENDUM SHOW PEOPLE HAVE REJECTED A MOVE TO CHANGE THE COUNTRY'S FLAG AND REMOVE THE UNION JACK VOTERS HAD THE OPTION OF CHOOSING AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN BASED AROUND THE SILVER FERN ONE OF NEW ZEALAND IS TRADITIONAL SYMBOLS INITIAL RESULTS AS POLLING CLOSED SHOWED FIFTY SIX POINT SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE CHOSE TO KEEP THE CURRENT FLAG JOHN DONNA SOME REPORTS FROM AUCKLAND
AFTER A YEAR LONG CAMPAIGN IN A PROCESS THAT HAS COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NEW ZEALAND IS APPEAR TO HAVE OPTED TO STICK WITH THE STATUS QUO PROPONENTS OF CHANGE INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER JOHN KEY HAD ARGUED THE CURRENT FLAG WITH THE UNION JACK IN THE CORNER WAS A THROWBACK TO A COLONIAL ERA AND NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A LONG INDEPENDENT NATION BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE BRITISH ROOTS MANY FEEL THE CURRENT FLAG REFLECTS STRONG CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL TIES
OTHERS SIMPLY DIDN'T LIKE THE NEW ALTERNATIVE DESIGN HAVE A SILVER FERN ON A BLUE AND BLACK BACKGROUND THE CURRENT FLAG HAS BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND LIVES TO FLY ANOTHER DAY
JOHN DONNA SOME REPORTING IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THERE IS A MASSIVE MANHUNT UNDERWAY IN BELGIUM A SEARCH FOR THE THIRD BOMBER THE MAN IN A WHITE JACKET AND BLACK HAT SCENE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH WITH THE TWO MEN WHO BLEW THEMSELVES UP AT BRUSSELS AIRPORT HE FLED THE SCENE LEAVING THE BAG THE BELGIAN INVESTIGATORS SAY CONTAINED THE BIGGEST BOMB IT ANY LATER PARTIALLY EXPLODED AFTER POLICE HAD EVACUATED THE AIRPORT SO IT CAUSED NO FURTHER CASUALTIES
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED ON TUESDAY AND ABOUT SIXTY OF THOSE ARE STILL IN A CRITICAL CONDITION SO THE DEATH TOLL AT THIRTY ONE IS EXPECTED TO RISE OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICES IN THE PAST HAVE A BOUGHT IN THE CENTRE OF BRUSSELS WHICH HAS BECOME THE FOCUS OF TRIBUTES TO THOSE KILLED IN THE BOMBINGS AND MATTHEW WHAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE THERE IN THIS MORNING
THERE ARE STILL SOME PEOPLE TURNING UP TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS TO TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND THERE STANDING LOOKING AT A GROWING A CARPET OF SCUSE ME FLOWERS AND AND CANDLES
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO STEP TOO FAR AWAY TO TO SEE A BUSTLING CITY A CITY WHICH IS EXPERIENCING A FAIRLY NORMAL RUSH HOUR WHICH IS QUITE REMARKABLE IN WAY CONSIDERING IT'S ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS SINCE
THOSE TERRIBLE ATTACKS THE METRO STATION WHICH WAS ATTACKED THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE THE FOUR LANE ROAD RUNNING PAST IT WHICH IS A MAIN
ROAD IN THIS CITY THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR SINCE THE ATTACKS THAT'S NOW REOPENED AND THE FORENSIC TEAMS THAT WERE CLUSTERED AROUND THAT STATION NOW SEEM TO HAVE MOVED ON SO ALTHOUGH THE STATION WON'T OPEN FOR A WHILE
THEY SEEM TO HAVE CARRIED OUT CERTAINLY THEIR WORK ABOVE GROUND THAT THEY WERE DOING OTHER STATIONS IN THE CITY INCLUDING THE GARD DU MIDI WHICH IS WHERE A EUROSTAR TRAINS ARRIVE FROM BRITAIN
THOSE HAVE SOLDIERS OUTSIDE ARMY TRUCKS ARE DOTTED AROUND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CITY I GUESS THAT THE PLACES THE BOOTS FELT BY THE AUTHORITIES TO BE MORE VULNERABLE AND INDEED THERE ARE SECURITY CHECKS OF PEOPLE GOING INTO SOME OF THE BIGGER STATIONS IN THIS CITY AT THEM
OF COURSE THE URGENCY FOR THE POLICE IS TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS I I MENTION THE THIRD MAN IN THE SCENE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH AT THE AIRPORT BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS POSSIBLY CONNECTED TO THE METRO BOMBER
YES SO THIS IS COMING OUT OF BELGIAN MEDIA AND WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE IS THAT THE C.C.T.V. IMAGES WHICH SHOW THE ONE OF THE ELBA QUARRY BROTHERS WHO WAS THE SUICIDE BOMBER AND KNOWN TO BE AT THE METRO STATION BUT THE NEXT TO HIM IN THESE IMAGES IS A MAN WITH WHAT'S DESCRIBED AS OF AN EXTREMELY LARGE BAG WHO IS WALKING ALONG AND HE IS IT'S DESCRIBED
LOCAL MEDIA SOURCES HE IS ACCOMPANYING ELBA QUARRY BROTHER NOW AT THE MOMENT THE POLICE DO NOT KNOW IF HE WAS ANOTHER BOMBER IF HE WAS INDEED CONNECTED TO ELBA QUARRY IF HE WAS KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION IF YOU'RE STILL ALIVE SO THEY WANT TO TRY AND IDENTIFY THAT
MATTHEW PRICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WE'RE JOINED FROM THE HAGUE BY ROB WAINWRIGHT WHO IS DIRECTOR OF EUROPE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL US ABOUT THOSE MEN WE KNOW THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS WELL AS A VERY FAST MOVING SITUATION EUROPOL HAVE DEPLOYED SOME OFFICERS TO THE POLICE TUMOUR PROBABLY INVESTIGATING THIS THIS TRAGIC INCIDENTS IN BRUSSELS WE KNOW THERE HIS CONNECTIONS TO THE WIDER NETWORK WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TAX
IN PARIS WE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH HOWEVER WE ARE NOW UNCOVERING MORE WIDESPREAD NETWORK THAN WAS FIRST FEARED AND IT I THINK HE'S CONSISTENT THEREFORE WITH THE OBSERVATION WE'VE BEEN MAKING FOR SOME TIME BUT WE ARE FACED BY A MORE DANGEROUS MORE URGENT SECURITY THREAT FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND IT DIDN'T DID IT IT THREATENS NOT AS FRANCE AND BELGIUM BUT A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AT THE SAME TIME WHAT SORT OF NUMBERS ARE WE TALKING
WELL IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE ON ACTIVE DUTY IF I CAN CALL IT THAT IN PREPARING TO LAUNCH ATTACKS IN IN EUROPE BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A COMMUNITY OF FIVE THOUSAND
SUSPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN RADICALISED IN EUROPE THAT HAVE TRAVELLED TO SYRIA AND IRAQ FOR CONFLICT EXPERIENCE SOME OF WHOM NOT ALL HAVE SINCE COME BACK TO EUROPE AND SOME OF THOSE WILL BE AMONG THOSE THAT ARE TAKING PART IN WHAT IS CLEARLY A NEW STRATEGY THAT THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE HAVE LAUNCHED NOW IN THE WEST TO TAKE A SONG AND A MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY TO USE TEAMS OF WELL TRAINED WELL PLANNED
TERRORISTS TO TO CARRY OUT MULTIPLE ATTACKS AIMED AT MASS CASUALTIES DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR THAT THIRD MAN SEEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPH AT THE AIRPORT THE MAN IN THE WHITE JACKET AND BLACK AS WELL AS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE WORKING ON WITH ART OF HER CONTACTS IN BELGIUM AND WE URGENTLY TRYING TO UNCOVER THAT AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I CAN TALK IN PUBLIC ABOUT SO WHAT YOU YOU DO KNOW YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO SAY OR YOU DON'T
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANY MORE THIS MORNING SO I'M AFRAID OH K. THE OTHER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN SAID SINCE THE ATTACKS HIS COMMENTS FROM TURKEY SAYING LOOK THEY GAVE WARNINGS THEY DEPORTED ONE OF THESE SUICIDE BOMBERS BUT BELGIUM DID NOTHING ABOUT IT
WELL I CAN'T COMMENT ABOUT THE BILATERAL EXCHANGES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN TURKEY AND BELGIUM I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT BUT INDEED THERE IS A FRAGMENTED INTELLIGENCE PICTURE HAS THERE ALWAYS IS IN SUCH CASES THAT ARE COMING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I AS A COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WOULD COME TOGETHER PERHAPS IN A MORE INTEGRATED WAY TO ESTABLISH WHAT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE NETWORK IS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE I MEAN YOU WILL KNOW THAT SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE WHO IS FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX HAS WRITTEN AN ARTICLE IN PROSPECT PROSPECT MAGAZINE IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE U.K. WITH THE E.U. BUT AS PART OF IT HE TALKS ABOUT EUROPOL YOUR AGENCY'S ROLE SAYING IT'S OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE
WELL I SUDDENLY RESPECTS SIR RICHARD'S VIEWS BELLA BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THE TEN YEARS OR SO SINCE HE LEFT LEFT OFFICE I'VE SEEN HUGE PROGRESS IN THE E.U. ACTUALLY BUILDING UP HER FAR FAR STRONGER CAPABILITY TO TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND SERIOUS CRIME AND THEN DO THE U.K. IN FACT AS BEING VERY OFTEN THE DRIVER OF THAT WORK SO THE SCALE OF LEVEL OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE U.K. NOW HAS WITH THE PARTNERS IN THIS TO MAIM
HIS CONSIDERABLE AND YOU KNOW I SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT AWFUL BRITISH POLICE AUTHORITIES EVERY DAY OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT BEING USED TO FAST TRACK A THOUSAND SERIOUS OFFENDERS OFF THE STREETS OF BRITAIN EVERY YEAR FOR BORDER OFFICIALS IN BRITAIN HAVING ACCESS TO UNIQUE DATABASE OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WANTED CRIMINAL SUSPECTS ARE MISSING PEOPLE AS THEY ENTER ENTER BORDERS AND OF COURSE IT ALSO I CURE YOU MENTION EUROPOL I CAN TELL YOU THAT LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
NEW CASES OF CROSS BORDER CRIME AND TERRORISM IN EUROPE LAUNCHED BY BRITISH AUTHORITIES THROUGH THE RIPPLE CHANNELLED HIS OWN UNIQUE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDING DAILY OPERATIONAL BENEFIT TO HELP BRITISH AUTHORITIES PROTECT THE BORDERS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS BUT HE MAKES THE POINT IN THIS ARTICLE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT SEEMS CRITICAL GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE TERRORIST THREAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT SHARED ACROSS ALL TWENTY EIGHT STATES BECAUSE THEY ARE POTENTIALLY A COLANDER FOR INTELLIGENCE WAY THAT WAS HIS WORK
WE HAVE BILLS TO MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION WAS SEREN PLATFORMS INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COUNTER TERRORISM CENTRE YOU'RE APPALLED EVEN IN THE WAKE OF THE PARIS ATTACKS THAT THE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE SHED HAS HAS CONSIDERABLY GROWN WE'VE PUT IN PLACE THEREFORE A FRAMEWORK FOR AFFECTIVE CORPORATION BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE END OF COURSE ON THE APPETITE AND HE HAD THE ABILITY OF MEMBER STATES TO TO SHARE ALL OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE BUT BY MAKING AN ARGUMENT THAT WE WERE BETTER OFF BY NOT HAVING THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT ALL
I DON'T THINK STANDS MUCH SCRUTINY WE'VE PUT THEM IN PLACE IS FROM MEMBER STATES TO USE THEM BY AND LARGE THEY ARE EASING THEM AND EVERY DAY AS A SAID OPERATIONAL BENEFITS THE RECRUIT FROM THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT AT ALL MEMBER STATES INCLUDING THE U.K. IN ITS ABILITY TO FIGHT WHAT IS CLEARLY A MORE TRANS NATIONAL FORM OF ORGANISED CRIME AND TERRORISM THAT WE FACE SO YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT BRITAIN IS BETTER OFF IN THE E.U. BECAUSE IT BENEFITS FROM THAT
WELL THE IDEA THAT THAT WAS SOMEHOW WE WILL BE SAFER BY REMOVING OR DIMINISHING OUR ACCESS TO WHAT ARE DOZENS OF UNIQUE DATABASES AND POLICE CO CORPORATION INSTRUMENTS THAT I THINK AS I SAID BRITAIN HAS COME TO RELY ON MORE AND MORE IN RECENT YEARS JUST AS A SERIOUS MUST COLD CALCULATION IT DETERS DOESN'T STAND SCRUTINY AND THAT'S NOT ONLY MY VIEW YOU KNOW LAST YEAR PARLIAMENT AFTER SCRUTINY IN BOTH HOUSES TAKING EVIDENCE FROM
ALL SECTIONS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IN BRITAIN DECIDED THAT THE U.K. IT WAS IN THE U.K. AS CRITICAL INTEREST TO MAINTAIN ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THIRTY FIVE INSTRUMENTS OF POLICE CO OPERATION IN THE E.U. AND HAS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE COMING FROM THE POLICE COMMUNITY AT THE TIME BUT I THINK HE'S JUST A STRONG TODAY IT'S OVER WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT APPLIES TO THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW WITH THESE BOMBERS ON THE LOOSE AND THEIR SON TALKS OF FIVE BOMBERS ON THE LOOSE YOU TALK ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SUSPECTS
ONE WONDERS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT THE CHANCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COUNTRY LIKE BELGIUM CAN BE ACROSS IT
IT'S CERTAINLY THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT WE FACED IN AT LEAST A DECADE AND THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF IT INCLUDING THE WAY IN WHICH SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE MAKES INNOVATIVE USE OF THE INTERNET TO HERSELF TO RADICALISE AND RECRUIT LARGER SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION STEVE THESE ARE TO SOME EXTENT NEW UNPRECEDENTED THREATS THAT WE FACE I HAVE TO SAY BEHIND THE SCENES OFTEN NOT SEEN BY THE PUBLIC OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE DOING STERLING WORK IN PREVENTING
MOST ATTACKS CERTAINLY BUT THE NATURE OF THE THREAD THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S DISPERSED ACROSS A LARGELY UNCONNECTED RANDOMISE COMMUNITY OF AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS MEANS THAT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO REDUCE THE THREAT TO ZERO SO WE YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS OF COURSE WE DO I WILL BE ATTENDING THE SPECIAL MEETING OF INTERMENT SCHISM BRUSSELS LATER TODAY
HER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN GO EVEN FURTHER IN MAKING USE OF ALL OF THESE CORPORATION INSTRUMENTS IN EUROPE HOW TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE EXCHANGE AND OPERATION AGAINST WHAT WHAT A NETWORK SPREAD ACROSS EUROPE AND I'M DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ROBIN WAINWRIGHT FROM EUROPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LISTENING TO THAT THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. DAVID DAVIS FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY CAMPAIGNER FIRST LEAVE THE E. USE ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU CAN WORRY
WHY IS THE BOSS OF EUROPOL WRONG WELL WELL IT'S A VERY GOOD COP AND HE'S DEFENDING HIS HIS OWN ORGANISATION OF COURSE BUT RICHARD DEARLOVE WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT THIS RICHARD HE LOVES PROBABLY THE SMARTEST OF WAR ONE OF THE SMARTEST OF THE MODERN SPY CHIEFS I USED TO WORK WITH HIM IN THE DAY
AND ONE THINKS HE FOCUSED ON WAS THE LACK OF BORDER CONTROL THEY'LL LOOK AT THE PARIS AND BRUSSELS ATROCITIES
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO PARIS HAD COME ALL THE WAY FROM SYRIA ACROSS FIVE BORDERS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MANNED OR TWENTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE A SHOWING IN I'M NOT THERE WHEN HE GOT TO BRUSSELS HE AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH VIOLENT CRIMINAL OFFENCES CONVICTIONS AND TERRORIST CONNECTIONS CROSSED THE BORDER AGAIN INTO FRANCE CARRYING THE SUICIDE VEST EXPLOSIVES
CARRYING WEAPONS CARRY KALASHNIKOVS AND CARRY OUT THE ATROCITY IN PARIS THEN AFTER THAT WITH A FULL TERRORIST ALERT ON AT LEAST ONE OF THEM CROSSED ANOTHER BORDER BACK INTO BROTHELS JUST ONE PRACTICAL EXAMPLE
OF THE DAMAGE DONE BY THE FREE MOVEMENT PEOPLE STEEPED IT THROUGH INTO TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY NUMBER ONE NOT A NOT A FREEMAN TO PEOPLE THAT EXTENDS TO ASK AS THEY'RE NOT IN SHANG A NUMBER TWO AS WE KNOW VERY WELL IN THIS COUNTRY AND INDEED HAS BEEN THE CASE IN EUROPE AS WELL EVEN IF NOBODY COULD MOVE ACROSS BORDERS THERE WOULD STILL BE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT THREAT
YEAH OF COURSE AND THAT FRED THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT ISN'T IT YES OF COURSE AND AS FOR WHEN I SAID HE TALKED ABOUT THE FIVE THOUSAND BASICALLY THOSE SHE HAD THIS WE'VE HAD I SAW TRAINING FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN EUROPE THEY CAN MOVE AROUND THIS PARTICULAR TEAM THAT OPERATED OUT OF BRUSSELS HAD MEETINGS IN HUNGARY FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN MOVE AROUND IT WERE IN EUROPE THEY CAN GO TO THE PLACE WHERE THE WEAKEST
SECURITY SERVICES ARE ON THAT ONE THINGS ARE RICHARD DEARLOVE SO YOU'VE GOT A VERY WIDE RANGE OF CAPABILITY WITHIN EUROPE WHICH WE ARE AT THE TOP YOU CAN'T ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE AND THE OTHER THING VERY SIMPLY IS THAT MANY OF THESE
KILLERS THERE'S NO OTHER WORD FOR THEM REALLY YOU MAKE OF THESE KILLERS WERE EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS WHICH MEANS ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH WE'RE OUTSIDE CHECK AND WE CAN'T STOP THEM COMING BRITAIN BUT OF COURSE WE'VE HAD KILLERS OF OUR OWN WHO ARE U.K. CITIZENS OF CALLING US AND THEN THEY'VE NOBODY'S NOBODY'S ARGUING AND INDEED THAT'S RIGHT BUT NOBODY'S ARGUING THAT THIS THREAT IS REDUCED WAS ERA I AGREED ABSOLUTEMENT ROBERT BROADWAY ON THAT QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER OR NOT
BEING INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WHAT RICHARD DID UP AS RAISING WITH IT BEING IN HELPS OR HINDERS AND HE SAYS IT BEING OUTSIDE DOES NOT HINT OF WE ARE THE BIGGEST MOST POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE OPERATION IN EUROPE EVERYBODY WILL CONTINUE TO CO OPERATE WITH WHAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN CO OPERATION WE JUST MUSTN'T OVERESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH
INTELLIGENCE CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE IS ABSOLUTELY NEVER CAMP IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING POINT ABOUT OUR STRENGTH AND INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A STATEMENT THIS MORNING FROM SIR DAVID OMEN FORMER HEAD OF G.C.H.Q. COMING UP ON THE OTHER SIDE TO RICHARD DEARLOVE AND HE SAYS REALLY INTERESTING ACTUALLY SAYS THE STRONGER SECURITY ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE IS THE SAFER WE WILL BE ANNIE ASKED THIS QUESTION
WILL ARE PULLING OUT IMPROVE THE CHANCES OF STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY OF OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS WHAT WHAT'S THE ANSWER THAT WELL IT'LL STRENGTHEN OUR SECURITY THERE'S LOOK WHAT ABOUT MY BIKE I'M GOING LET ME LET ME ANSWER THE QUESTION IF YOU HAD IT AS OUR SECURITY IT WILL MAKE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO THE SECURITY OF THE E. U. ITSELF WHAT WILL AFFECT THAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE'S THEY FACE UP
TO SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS THEY HAVE IF THEY LEAVE SHANE AND AS IT IS OR CONTINUE ON THE PATH AS IT'S ON TO COMPLETELY REMOVE ALL BORDER CONTROLS THEN THEY WILL MAKE THEIR OWN SECURITY WORSE WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS TAKE ON BOARD
FOR CORRECTING THEIR OWN PROBLEMS KINGHAM IS AN OBSESSION BLUNTLY I MEAN I'M I'M THE MINISTER WHO NEGOTIATE DOES TO STAY OUT IF YOUNG BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS HIMSELF WE CAN'T FIX THAT FOR THEM BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONG INTELLIGENCE CORPORATION BUT THAT HER CO OPERATION IS BILATERAL WHY ELSE OURSELVES THAT THEY THEM AND SAYS FROM THE TABLE WHEN OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS AS THEY WILL DISCUSS HOW TO MAKE A
BUILT IN THEIR INSECURITY NO WE COULD BE PART OF THAT WHERE THE LEADING INTELLIGENCE PROVIDERS OF THE REST OF EUROPE HE SAYS AND WE OUGHT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IT'S AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT ISN'T IT IT'S NOT ABOUT NECESSARILY IS THERE SECURITY THIRTY BECAUSE THEIR SECURITY IN WHEN IT'S ON WITH THE SPEC THE BEGINNING OF IT WAS IN THE CENTRE GOT ARTICLE WE DO NOT DO OUR PRIMARY INTELLIGENT CO OPERATION THROUGH THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE DO IT THROUGH DEALS WITH THAT WITH OUR PARTNERS MOST PARTICULARLY FRANCE AND GERMANY ON THE CONTINENT SO NOT ABSENT THING OURSELVES FROM THAT BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS GIVING OURSELVES BACK ONE OF THE WEAPONS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WEAPONS FOR DEALING WITH TERRORISM AND THE ABILITY TO STOP PEOPLE AT THE BORDER CHECK PEOPLE ABOARD OR DEPORT PEOPLE WE WOULD KEEP SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO AT THE MOMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE THEY SAY THAT WHO WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE WAY EUROPE IS GOING
THE DEAL WE'VE JUST STRUCK ALL THEY HAVE JUST STRUCK WITH TURKEY INVOLVES FREE VISA FREE ACCESS FOR ALL TWENTY CITIZENS TO ALL OF EUROPE
THAT REALLY MEANS VISA FREE ACCESS WITH ALL PEOPLE CARRYING TURKISH PAPERS IF YOU IMAGINE THAT SYRIAN SHE HAD THIS CAN'T GET TURKISH PAPERS THEN I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF TURKEY WHICH MEANS WE'VE OPENED UP
NOT CLOSE DOWN OPENED UP THE ACCESS THE TERRORIST IF THAT SORT OF THING WE HAVE TO FOLK WHAT ABOUT ALL THESE TO A DATABASE IS THE WRONG WAY MIGHT WAS TALKING TO TERESA MAYHEM SECTOR IS ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE WAY WE WOULD POTENTIALLY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT WOULDN'T WORRY AGAIN LOOK MOST OF THOSE CRIMINAL FOR A START
SECONDLY WE WE WOULD MAINTAIN THAT ACCESS MOST IF IN THE EVENT OF BRETT WE COULDN'T SURE OH YES I THINK WE COULD I MEAN WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO WE'VE GOT THE BIGGEST DATABASE WHAT THE BIGGEST D.N.A. DATABASE GOT THE BIGGEST INTELLIGENCE THEY DEBATE I'VE GOT THE BIGGEST SURVEILLANCE DATABASE THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO NOT DEAL WITH THIS THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS
DAVID DAVIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT SHAKESPEARE'S SKULL IS MISSING THAT IS THE RATHER BIZARRE SUGGESTION FROM THE FIRST EVER ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF HIS GRAVE IT'S BEEN ALLOWED BECAUSE IT IS THE FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH NOT THAT THE GRAVE ITSELF HAS BEEN DISTURBED INSTEAD GROUND PENETRATING RADAR WAS USED TO SCAN BENEATH THE GRAVESTONE PROBABLY A GOOD THING GIVEN THE WARNING INSCRIBED ON THAT STONE
BLESSED BE THE MAN THAT SPARES THESE STONES AND CURSED BE HE THAT MOVES MY BONES WHEN YOU CAN SEE A DOCUMENT ABOUT THE FINDINGS ON CHANNEL FOUR ON SATURDAY NIGHT IT'S PRESENTED BY THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORIAN DOCTOR HELEN CASTOR WHO'S HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING YOU RUNNING AND YET SOMEONE DID MOVE HIS BONES FROM WHAT YOU HAVE A STAB
WELL WE CAN'T PROVE THAT HIS SKULL IF DEFINITIVELY NOT THERE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SOMETHING VERY PECULIAR HAS HAPPENED AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY INFERENCE
SHAKESPEARE'S GRAVE IS UNUSUAL EVEN FROM SURFACE LEVEL IT'S VERY ODD THE STONE IS TOO SHORT IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME OR A DATE IT JUST HAS THESE FOUR LINES OF VERSE AS YOU'VE JUST SAID PUTTING A CURSE ON ANYONE WHO MIGHT DISTURB WHAT LIES WITHIN
AND IT TURNS OUT FROM THE G.P. ARE THAT IT'S JUST AS PECULIAR UNDER THE SURFACE I SHOULD SAY STRAIGHT AWAY G. P. R. IS NOT LIKE AN ULTRASOUND SCAN OF YOUR BABY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A SKELETON FROM THE AND THAT STANDS FOR GROUND PENETRATING RADAR GROUND PENETRATING RADAR WHAT IT DOES IS GIVE US THROUGH THE VERY EXPERT INTERPRETATION OF A GEOPHYSICIST ERICA ITSY IT GIVES US A VIEW OF THE MATERIAL STRUCTURE BELOW THE FLOOR
AND THAT SHOWS THAT SHAKESPEARE WASN'T BURIED AS THE RECEIVED WISDOM IS ALWAYS HAD IT IN A FAMILY VAULT INSTEAD HE'S IN A SHALLOW GRAVE AND SOMETHING VERY PECULIAR HAS HAPPENED AT THE HEAD END OF THE SHALLOW GRAVE BECAUSE THERE'S A MAJOR REPAIR THERE AND WHY WOULD A MAJOR REPAIR CUTTING RIGHT ACROSS THE HEAD OF SHAKESPEARE'S SHALLOW GRAVE
HAVE BEEN NECESSARY AND THERE IT TIES IN WITH SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND THOUGHT WAS FICTION WHICH IS THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF GRAVE ROBBERS THAT'S RIGHT THIS WAS A STORY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE REFERRING TO EVENTS THAT ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR WHEN TROPHY HUNTERS WE MIGHT CALL THEM
A LOCAL SURGEON AFTER A BOUNTY OF THREE HUNDRED GUINEAS FITTER A LITERARY CONNOISSEUR HAD OFFERED TO ANYONE WHO COULD BRING HIM SHAKESPEARE SKULL BROKE INTO THE CHURCH AND TOOK THE SKULL THAT'S HOW THE STORY GOES AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DISMISSED AS FICTION BUT IT'S GOT LOTS OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL THAT STORY INCLUDING THE SUGGESTION BUT IT WAS ONLY THREE FEET DOWN WITH SHAKESPEARE SKULL WAS FOUND AND
A SURVEY HAS NOW PROVED THAT HE DOES IN FACT LIE THREE FEET DOWN IN A SHALLOW GRAVE OH KAY SO SHAKESPEARE SKULL IS WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COULD BE
THAT'S THE NEXT BIG QUESTION WHAT THE HUNT GOES ON FOR WHOMEVER DOWN THE CENTURIES OF POSSIBLY HANDED HER SKULL WELL THERE WAS POSSIBLY READ HAMLET TO IT EXACTLY THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES BUT THERE WAS A SECOND PART TO THE STORY THAT SUGGESTED THAT THE SKULL HAD EVENTUALLY BEEN DUMPED IF YOU LIKE IN THE CRYPT OF A CHURCH FIFTY MILES AWAY IN WORCESTERSHIRE WHERE INDEED
CRYPT THAT USUALLY KEPT SEALED THERE HAS BEEN A ROGUE SKULL THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID WAS SHAKESPEARE'S WE GOT TO GO AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT SCAN IT THREE.D. ANALYSIS GOT A TOP FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT
AND HER ANALYSIS IS THAT IT BELONGS TO A WOMAN WHO DIED IN HER SEVENTIES
SHAKESPEARE SADLY NOT A WOMAN HE DIED IN THE SEVENTIES SO THEM TO MY DAD HARRY REMAINS BUT THAT INVESTIGATION THE CHANNEL FOUR PROGRAMME SECRET HISTORY HISTORY SHAKESPEARE'S TOMB YOU CAN SEE ON SATURDAY NIGHT TOLD ALAN COSTA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANKS GARY THINKING MUST CHECK THE ATTIC THE SPORT

THANKS LOOK AT THE WEATHER BREEZY RAIN AT TIMES YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM NEIL SLEET OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ONE OF THE JIHADISTS WHO BOMBED THE CITY'S AIRPORT ON TUESDAY WAS THE MAN SUSPECTED OF HAVING MADE THE BOMBS USED IN THE ATTACKS IN PARIS FOR MONTHS AGO UNCONFIRMED REPORTS SAY D.N.A. EVIDENCE IS LINKED TO THE ATTACKS IN BOTH BRUSSELS AND PARIS
THE DIRECTOR OF EUROPE OLD ROB WAINWRIGHT TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THERE WAS CLEARLY A NEW STRATEGY BY JIHADISTS TO TAKE ON THE WEST IN A MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY A VERDICT IS EXPECTED TODAY IN THE WAR CRIMES TRIAL OF THE FORMER BOSNIAN SERB LEADER RADHA VAN CARRIAGE EJ THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WILL RULE ON WHETHER HE IS GUILTY OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY DURING THE BOSNIAN WAR IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES

INITIAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NEW ZEALAND HAS HAVE VOTED TO KEEP THEIR CURRENT NATIONAL FLAG WHICH FEATURES THE UNION JACK VOTERS HAD THE OPTION OF CHOOSING AN ALTERNATIVE DESIGN BASED ON THE SILVER FERN ONE OF NEW ZEALAND TRADITIONAL SYMBOLS
THANK YOU TIME TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE FIGHT AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE BEING FOUGHT IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HOLD TERRITORY IN PARTS OF SYRIA AND IRAQ WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IN THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT THAT FIGHT HAS INTENSIFIED
PARTICULARLY IRAQI ARMED FORCES BEGINNING THEIR OFFENSIVE AGAINST SO CALLED I S. IN THE REGION AROUND MOST SALT AND THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO CLOSING IN THEY SAY ON THE HISTORIC UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE OF PALMYRA WE CAN TALK TO RUN IRAQ HIGHAM THE B.B.C.'S CORRESPONDENT IN BEIRUT IN DEAD GIVE US A SENSE RUMMY FIRST OF ALL ON THOSE TWO FRONT OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I PERSONALLY LOST COUNT OF THE TIMES THAT THE IRAQI AUTHORITIES HAVE ANNOUNCED AN IMMINENT OR AN OPERATION THAT'S ABOUT TO SPARK IN MORE SORT OF SPECIFICALLY BUT ALSO ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS LATEST TALK IS NOT SERIOUS IT MAY WELL BE BUT MORE SORT OF COURSE IS
ARGUABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STRONGHOLD FOR ISLAMIC STATE AND ANY BATTLE TO THREE A GIRL MORE THRILLERS PROBABLY GOING THERE QUITE SOME TIME PUB MIRRORS OF THE STORY IN SERIES WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT ADVANCES BY THE SYRIAN ARMY ALLIED MILITIA UNDER A HEAVY RUSSIAN AIR COVER
SINCE ALMOST THE BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH BUT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD MORE ADVANCES LAST WEEK IRONICALLY AND ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE STOCKED
WITHDRAW THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MILITARY FORCES IN THERE IN THE PAST FEW DAYS THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES FROM BOTH THE SOUTHERN AND THE WESTERN FIVE OFF
ALL REPORTS SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE ABOVE TO TAKE THE CITY ON THE MOSEL FRONT WHAT IS IT THAT HE'S BEEN HOLDING THINGS BACK AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED
SEVERAL FACTORS MEN APPARENTLY IT'S A VERY LARGE VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE MUSCLE BECAUSE OF SIZE BECAUSE OF THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP POOR DEFENCES IN THE AREA POLITICALLY IT'S A VERY TRICKY AFFAIR AND WE SHOULD KNOW THAT WHEN MORE SUE WAS WRESTED FROM THE CONTROL OF THE IRAQI ARMY IS THE A LOT OF THE POPULATION OF MORTAL WELCOME
THE ENTRANCE OFF SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS WHICH WHICH FIRST TOOK IT OVER IT WASN'T JUST AT THE BEGINNING OR AT LEAST IT WASN'T SO CLEAR THAT IT WAS ONLY I WAS AT THE BEGINNING THERE'S A LOCK OR THERE WAS A LOT OF HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE IRAQI ARMY AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAS CHANGED IF THAT HAS CHANGED AT ALL SO POLITICALLY TO SPARK OFF OFF THE DEEP DIVISIONS IN THE IRAQ THAT EVEN PRECEDED THE RISE OF ISLAMIC STATE
AS WE HAVE SEEN IT'S FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR IN C. THAT'S THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THIS AND OBVIOUSLY THE MILITARY SIDE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE BECAUSE OF THE DEFENCES OF ISLAMIC STATE IS THAT IS A FACT FACTORIES WHO WILL TAKE PART IN ANY OPERATION WILL THE LARGE A FORCE KNOWN AS THE POPULAR IMMOBILISATION UNITS WHICH IS MADE UP OF
ARMED FACTIONS IN IRAQ WERE LATE THICK PART MANY FACTIONS WILL FIGHT ISLAMIC STATE HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO ANY RULED FOR THEM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE FIGHTING FORCES ON THE GROUND ALL OF THESE FACTORS COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT ANY OPERATION FOR THE THICK WASN'T FROM ISLAMIC STATE
SPEAKING TO US FROM THERE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE THE FORMER SUNDERLAND PLAYER ADAM JOHNSON IS TO BE SENTENCED LATER TODAY FOR CHILD SEX OFFENCES IN COURT HE ADMITTED THAT BEING A FOOTBALLER HAD MADE HIM ARROGANT AND HAD SLOWED DOWN HIS MATURITY
HIS FOOTBALL'S VAST WEALTH WHICH WILL ONLY INCREASE WITH NEXT SEASON'S MULTI MILLION POUND TELEVISION DEAL CREATING PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW AND HOW HAS THIS CULTURE DEVELOP JONATHAN LEDGE OUT
MANCHESTER UNITED'S FAMOUS CLASS OF NINETY TWO THE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL YOUTH TEAM INCLUDED THE LIKES OF DAVID BECKHAM AND GARY NEVILLE RYAN GIGGS AND KEITH GILLESPIE
GILLESPIE WAS A NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNATIONAL FOR FOURTEEN YEARS WELL AT NEWCASTLE BLACKBURN LESTER AMONG OTHER CLUBS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN HE WAS DECLARED BANKRUPT THE LOST A LOT OF MONEY OVER THE YEARS THROUGH BALHAM INVESTMENTS THROUGH GAMBLING
HIS GAMBLING ADDICTION COST OF AROUND SEVEN MILLION POUNDS FOR ME LOSING MONEY YOU ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO GET A VERY GOOD WEIRD YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THAT SORT OF KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE ACTUALLY ILLUSION BECAUSE YOU KNEW YOU WERE ON A GOOD CONTRACT YOU WERE GETTING PAID GOOD MONEY AND YOU COULD GO RIGHT DO IT AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIVES AS PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLERS THE MONEY IN THE GAME HAS JUST SPIRALLED COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL NOW
LIZZIE CUNDY KNOWS FOOTBALL FROM THE INSIDE SHE WAS MARRIED TO JASON CUNDY FOR NINETEEN YEARS WHAT A START FOR CHELSEA AND TOTTENHAM IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE SHE SEEN THE AWARDS INCLUDING A HOUSE IN THE HAMPSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE WHERE I'VE COME TO MEET HER SHE'S ALSO SEEN THE PITFALLS I THINK THAT FOOTBALLERS ARE REALLY LIKE THE NEW ROCK'N'ROLL STARS GIRLS CONSTANTLY AFTER THEM BECAUSE IT'S AN EASY WAY OF GETTING THAT
LIFESTYLE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING CLASS BOYS HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR THEMSELVES AND GIRLS ONE A PIECE OF IT THEY FEEL THEY WON'T THINK IT'S AS WELL AND I DON'T THINK THE HUGE WAGES THAT ARE GIVEN A VERY YOUNG AGE SOME OF THE PLAYERS I KNOW EIGHTEEN GIVEN WAGES UP TO ONE HUNDRED K. A WEEK FOR A YOUNG BOY TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE PRESSURE OF FOOTBALL ARE YOU GOING TO CREATE A MONSTER SUCCESSFUL FOOTBALLERS OF COURSE I'M NOT ALONE IN THEIR SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT I THOUGHT I COULD GET AWAY WITH WHATEVER I WANTED TO AND DESERVED TO ENJOY
ALL THE TEMPTATIONS AROUND ME I FELT I WAS ENTITLED UNLIKE TIGER WOODS IS BEHAVIOUR AS AN INDIVIDUAL HOWEVER FOOTBALL'S EXCESSES CAN INVOLVE A WIDE RANGE OF IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG MEN EARNING MILLIONAIRES SALARY'S GOOD TO COAX CHAIRMAN STOKE CITY
I THINK THEY GET TOO MUCH TOO SOON AND I WOULD RATHER IF WE COULD DEVELOP A SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD HAVE THAT MONEY BUT LATER WHEN THEY'VE ACHIEVED MOTH I WORRY THAT SOME YOUNG
SUDDENLY GETTING THE KIND OF MONEY THEY'D NEVER DREAMT OF AND THAT MADE IT AND THEY CAN HAVE THEIR FLASH CARS OF THIS THAT AND THE OTHER AND THEN DEVELOP THEIR CAREERS
TRAINING AT DERBY COUNTY CONTINUE DESPITE THE INTERNATIONAL BREAK CURRENTLY FIFTH IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP THE CLUB HAS A PREMIER LEAGUE STAR SET UP TO DEVELOP THEIR PLAYERS I'M DOWN RUSSELL INTERIM HEAD COACH AND ACADEMY DIRECTOR AT DERBY COUNTY FOOTBALL CAMP BUT IN THIS HIGH PROFILE DIGITAL AGE THE ETHOS IS NOT MERELY ABOUT IMPROVING BALL SKILLS FORMAL EDUCATION IS VITAL TO T'WALL IT TO ALL OF US IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEM AS A PERSON
SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING WE HAD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING WE HAVE EXPERTS COME IN FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE SPORTING CHANCE FOR ADDICTION GAMBLING DRUGS WE NEED TO PREPARE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THIS CLUB FOR FURTHER KOREA'S PLAYER DISCIPLINE IS ALSO A KEY CHALLENGE FACING CHAIRMAN LIKE PETER COATES WHO ADMITS CLUBS INDULGE THEIR STARS TOO READILY YOU COULD ARGUE THEY GET TOO WELL LOOKED AFTER
WE DO TOO MUCH FOR THEM THERE'S A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT'S TRUE AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAY THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE A VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU TRY AND LOOK AFTER THEM AS BEST YOU CAN LAWYER MATT HEMSWORTH WORKS FOR A NUMBER OF PREMIER LEAGUE CLUBS OFFERING ADVICE AS MUCH AS CRISIS MANAGEMENT HE BELIEVES A NEW GENERATION OF MEDIA SAVVY PLAYERS ARE BEING TAUGHT TO PLAY A MORE MATURE GAME OFF THE PITCH
AND SO ATTRACT LESS DESTRUCTIVE HEADLINES THAN ADAM JOHNSON TO THE GAME WHICH REWARDS THEM SO WELL JOHNSON GREW UP IN A SOCIETY WHERE HE WAS WHAT I GUESS WE CAUGHT THE DISH TO IMMIGRANT SOCIAL MEDIA WAS NOT ALWAYS AROUND IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS WHERE'S THE NEW GENERATION COMING THROUGH DIGITAL NATIVES THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD SOCIAL MEDIA FOOTBALL CLUBS ARE TAKING THE EDUCATION ASPECTS OF THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T KNOW
JOHN DE LA JARRED HER REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE SINCE NINETEEN OH TWO THE NEW ZEALAND FLAG HAS BEEN IN THE UNION FLAG ALONGSIDE FOUR STARS THE UNION FLAG OF COURSE THE REFLECTION OF MUSEUMS CONNECTION TO THE U.K.
IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE BUT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HASN'T THEY'VE HAD THEIR REFERENDUM THEIR VOTE THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE THAT FLAG AND REPLACE IT WITH THEM BUSINESS SILVER FERN DESIGN SIR ALEXANDER LOCKWOOD SMITH IS NEW ZEALAND IS HIGH COMMISSIONER TO THE U.K. AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND HE VOTED ME OFF I THINK USING ORDERS TO KEEP IT

AND IT HAS BEEN WORTH IT BECAUSE ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS HE'S BEEN IT'S REALLY ENGAGED NEW ZEALAND AS WITH WITH OUR IDENTITY WITH POWDER HOW DO WE SEE OURSELVES ARE WE HAPPY WITH OUR FLAG AND AND I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY USEFUL PROCESS I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFETIME HAD MUSEUM AS TALK SO MUCH ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR IDENTITY IF YOU LIKE SOMEONE ON TWITTER SUGGESTED FLAG IN THAT FLAG FACE AS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WINNING DESIGN OF ACTUALLY WINNING THE THERE BUT YOU'VE DECIDED YOU'VE OPTED FOR THAT
STATUS QUO WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE STATE OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO BE A NEW ZEALANDER
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID FOR EXAMPLE HOW DOES THIS MEAN YOU ZEON MIGHT SEEK TO BECOME A REPUBLIC FOR EXAMPLE AND IT DOESN'T AIR ALL KNOW THAT THE FLAG WITH A RATHER THE OPPOSITE IF YOU CHOSEN THE SAME FLAG BUT IT I MEAN THE DEBATE AND THE WHOLE DEBATE ISH AND IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT WHAT IS THE CONVERSE OF THAT TRUE ACTUALLY THAT IN FACT NEW ZEALAND FEELS THAT THAT TYING TO US IS HUGELY IMPORTANT AND PART OF ITS IDENTITY AND PART OF YOUR IDENTITY AS A PERSON
I THINK IT IT'S I WOULDN'T TRY TO READ TOO MUCH INPUT LIKE THAT IS THE FLAG WE'VE HEAD THEY CAN'T FLAG FOR ONE HUNDRED SINCE NINETEEN OH TWO AND ONE FOR YOU ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN YEARS AND
AND IT'S MORE ABOUT IDENTITY THEN THEN USE ELANDS LINKAGE TO THE U.K. WHERE WE WE FEEL VERY AT HOME HERE IN THE U.K. BUT ACTUALLY AUCKLAND IS NOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S THREE MOST DIVERSE CITIES FORTY ODD PER CENT OF OF AUCKLAND AS WEREN'T WEREN'T BORN IN NEW ZEALAND
AND OF COURSE WE NOW HAVE QUITE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF ASIAN ORIGIN AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY ABOUT ABOUT LINKAGES AS MUCH AS THIS FLAG WE'VE IDENTIFIED WITH HUMANS AS FOUGHT TWO WORLD WARS UNDER THIS FLAG AND AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE A MATTER OF IDENTITY BUT OF COURSE WE DO FEEL VERY STRONGLY STILL LINKED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU PERSONALLY DISAPPOINT YOU TELL JEREMY VINE SHOW YOU WANTED DO YOU WANT IN THEIR NEW FLAG
I PUT ALLOWED TO DO THAT AS THE HIGH COMMISSIONER I CLOSELY VOTED TO CHANGE I MEAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL I PERSONALLY VOTED TO CHANGE BECAUSE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU'RE OVERSEAS YOU NOTICED NEW ZEALAND AS WHERE THE SILVER FERNS SO MUCH AND BUT
THIS IS NOW I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM THAT A FLAG AND I'M PROUD OF OUR FLAG AND AND AND I THINK WHAT I HOPE NEW ZEALAND AS WILL NOW DO IS EMBRACE HOW FLAYING MORE AND SEE IT MORE AS PART OF OUR IDENTITY SIR ALEXANDER LOCKWOOD SMITH OR NEW ZEALAND HIGH COMMISSIONER TO LONDON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE AND ADAM PARSONS IS BACK WITH US WITH AN UPDATE ON THAT ROW ABOUT TESCO'S MARKETING CAMPAIGNS YES REMEMBER WE TALKED A LITTLE EARLIER ABOUT TESCO'S REVAMPED RANGE OF FRESH PRODUCE USING THE NAMES OF FORMS THAT DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST I'VE GOT A PUNNET OF STRAWBERRIES HERE BRANDED AS COMING FROM ROSE DEAN FARMS

THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE USING FRANCE TO REPRESENT QUALITY SPECIFICATION THAT THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO MISLEAD ANYBODY TO BE FAIR IT IS WRITTEN HERE PRODUCE OF MOROCCO
WELL I SUPPOSE THAT'S THAT'S UP FOR OTHERS TO SAY CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THIS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO SUPERMARKETS HAVE A LISTENING IN IS THIS AN INITIATIVE THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE BURIED
THANK YOU THAT IAN PIGGOTT OUT THERE ON HIS ARABLE FARM IN HERTFORDSHIRE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NINE MINUTES TO NINE IT IS SEVENTY YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE ALASTAIR COOK FIRST BROADCAST HIS LETTER FROM
AMERICA RELEASE THAT'S WHAT IT BECAME KNOWN AS DURING THE COURSE OF THAT BROADCASTING LET'S LISTEN TO A BIT OF HIM KNOCKED OUT THE FIRST ONE I THINK BUT A BIT OF AN EARLY ONE IS DESCRIBING HIS JOURNEY FROM AN AUSTERE BRITAIN TO A BOUNTIFUL NEW YORK SAILING ON THE QUEEN MARY ALONGSIDE SEVERAL THOUSAND G.I. BRIDE TO ME RECALLS ARRIVING AT NEW YORK HARBOUR
TOWARDS THE LATE AFTERNOON OF THE FIFTH DAY WE WERE MOVING SLOWLY UP NEW YORK HARBOUR AND SLOWLY OUT OF THE MIST ROSE THE TOWERING CLUSTER OF THE DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPERS CROWNED WITH A SMALL CLOUD OF SMOKE AND FOG
SOME BRIGHT GIRL WONDERED WHY THEY SHOULD BE WHEN ALL AROUND US BLUE WATER AND THE SPARKLING SKY
IT WAS THE FIRST REMINDER OF NEW YORK AS IN A MINOR WAY A WAR CASUALTY
BEFORE THE WAR MANHATTAN WAS A SPARKLING ISLAND BOTH BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
BECAUSE THE CITY HAD A LAW FORBIDDING THE BURNING OF SOFT COAL ANYWHERE FOR MORE THAN TEN MINUTES A DAY
BUT IN NINETEEN FORTY WHEN NEIGHBOURING FACTORIES TURNED INTO WAR FACTORIES FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THE LAW WAS SUSPENDED AND IT'S NEVER BEEN PUT BACK
BY NOW A WHOLE FLEET OF LITTLE FREIGHTERS AND TAGS WERE PIPING OUT AS WE RODE BY
AND FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE QUEEN MARY TERRIFIED THE CHILDREN BY ROARING BACK THREE THUNDEROUS BLASTS
A SPECIALLY CHARTERED FERRYBOAT TAGGING ALONG BY OUR SIDE PLAYED JAZZ DUB VERSIONS OF WHY DID I KISS THAT GIRL AND HERE COMES THE BRIDE
THE CAPTAINS OF THE TUGBOAT TWIN LOOK SKY HIGH AND WAVE AT THE BRIDES AND SOON WE SAW GREAT SCIENCE PAINTED ON PIERS AND DUCKS WELCOME HOME AND WELL DONE
A SOLDIER A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME OF THE LUMP THAT CAME IN HIS THROAT WHEN HE HEARD THE BANDS AND SAW THEIR SCIENCE
FULL OF PRIDE ON BOUNCE HE WENT DOWN THE GANGPLANK TO MEET NEW YORK AND ITS GRATEFUL CITIZENS
HE WAS FAR FROM HOME AND HE STARTED TO LOOK FOR A HOTEL ROOM NOTHING HAD BEEN BUILT DURING THE WAR AND THE HOTELS WERE CRAMMED THEN HE LOOKED FOR JUST A ROOM ANYWHERE
HE WOUND UP BY BEGGING A MAN WHO RAN A TURKISH BATH FOR A SHEET JUST FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS HIS DO YOU A FAME FOR A JOB WELL DONE
ALISTAIR COOKE VOICE IT WAS ACTUALLY HIS FIRST SCRIPT THAT BUT OF COURSE IT WASN'T HIM
READING HIS FIRST SCRIPT FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT TO RE VOICE IT LATER ON AND HE READ THAT FIRST SCRIPT FOR THE FIRST TIME SEVENTY YEARS AGO TODAY AND OF COURSE IT'S WORTH SAYING THAT THOSE ALL OF HIS SCRIPTS ARE ALL THE AVAILABLE ONES HAVE BEEN ARCHIVED AND PUT ONLINE BY THE BBC
THE TIME IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO NINE THEY'D HAVE EUROPOL USE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TOLD US EARLIER THAT INTELLIGENCE AGENTS IN EUROPE ARE DEALING WITH FIVE THOUSAND SUSPECTS THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT HE SUGGESTED HAD BEEN RADICALISED IN EUROPE IT'S A MORE DANGEROUS AND URGENT SECURITY THREAT THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT
IN THE FACE OF THAT ARE WE ANY SAFER HERE THAN IN BELGIUM AWKWARD THEY'RE JUST AS EASILY BE A TERRORIST ATTACK HERE WE'RE JOINED FROM OXFORD BY ANDREW DOORMAN HE'S PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON AND HERE IN THE STUDIO BY MAAJID NAWAZ WHO'S FOUND A CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNTER EXTREMISM THINK TANK THE CUILLIN FOUNDATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR DOMINANT DO WE FACE AS A GREATER THREAT HERE
IF WE LOOK AT THE ATTACK ON HUMAN PROPORTION DO THE BELGIANS HAVE FAR GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM SYRIA WHO HAVE BEEN RADICALISED AND THEREFORE
WE PLAY THE NUMBERS GAME IT WILL SUGGESTS THAT THEY HAVE IRISH MORE SIGNIFICANT THREAT THAN WE DO HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE PROBABLY A MORE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL TARGET BURTON THAT BELGIUM IS SO THERE'S A SWINGS AND ROUNDABOUTS HERE IN TERMS OF WE ARE PROBABLY A GREATER THREAT TO PUT THIS PROPER GREATER NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS PROPORTIONALLY IN BELGIUM THREATENING BELGIUM CAME I DON'T KNOW IS WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT THAT WAS JUST ON THE NUMBERS WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE WE GOT RIGHT OR NOT GOT AS BADLY WRONG AS AS AS BELGIUM
WELL I THINK THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT I WON'T CONFIRM WHAT PROFESSOR DORMANT HAS SAID THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE FEW COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD BUT A MORE SYMBOLIC TO ATTACK THEN THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED KINGDOM SO I'D SAY AN ATTACK HERE IS ALMOST INEVITABLE END OUR SECURITY SERVICES HAVE THE SAME ASSESSMENT WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US IN THE PROPORTIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE FROM BELGIUM TO JOIN ISIS COULD BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE STATE OF DISINTEGRATION IN EUROPE'S MUSLIM COMMUNITIES ARE FRANCE BELGIUM AND A FEW OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE FARING
WORSE I THINK THEN WE ARE HERE AND WE'RE NOT DOING TOO WELL AT ALL SO IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING OF THE STATE OF INTEGRATION OF THE LACK OF OF EUROPEAN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES ON THE CONTINENT O.K. SO THE OTHER ARGUMENT HOW DID ROMAN OF COURSE IS THAT THE THREAT IS GREAT AS WE'RE HEARING IN THE U.K. IS A SYMBOLIC TARGET BUT THE SECURITY SORT SERVICES ARE DOING WELL AND WE KNOW NOT LEAST FROM RECENT COMMENTS THAT THEY FOILED SEVEN PLOTS
THAT'S CORRECT AND I THINK IF YOU COMPARE OURSELVES WITH WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM FOR FAR LONGER AND AS THE OTHER SPEAKERS INDICATE IT WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING VERY WELL BUT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT WE'RE BETTER THAN THE BELGIANS HAVE BEEN DOING AT THE SETS THEY HAVE BEEN IGNORING THE PROBLEM AND NOW AND NOW PLAYING CATCH UP AND TRYING TO DO WITH THE CHALLENGE AND AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE VARIOUS CHANCED UPON THROUGH THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF ATTEMPTS ON UNITED KINGDOM
I NOTE THAT TRUST YEARS THAT IT ONLY TAKES ONE TO BE SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU IMAGINE I WAS REFERRED TO ONE AS INEVITABLE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENED INDEED I'VE GOT A COLUMN IN THE TIMES TODAY AND I SPEAK ABOUT THIS I THINK I I WORRY THAT WE HAVE A STARTED ACROSS EUROPE AND WITH DONALD TRUMP IN AMERICA STARTED TO A DROP ADOPT THE FRAMEWORK THAT ISIS USES WHEN WHEN RELATING TO ONE ANOTHER ICE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST WANTS TO IDENTI WON'T WANT ME TO IDENTIFY HERE AS A MUSLIM BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
AND RELATE TO YOU ON THAT ON THAT BASIS UNFORTUNATELY IN A FEAR OR A REACTION TO THESE ATTACKS WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT POPULISTS ACROSS EUROPE WILL BE DOING THE SAME THING THEY WILL JUDGE ME FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A MUSLIM YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A NON MUSLIM AND PUT DOWN RELIGIOUS TESTS FOR THINGS LIKE IMMIGRATION AND THEREBY USED THE SAME FRAMEWORK THAT ISIS USES TO JUDGE PEOPLE WITH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS DIFFICULT ISN'T IT BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE PLENTY PEOPLE IS SO YOU SAY THE IDENTIFIES A CATHOLIC BEFORE THEY IDENTIFY AS A BRITISH BAT
YES I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH CATHOLICISM TODAY PERHAPS RELATED TO AIDS PERHAPS RELATED TO ABORTION PERHAPS RELATED TO CONTRACEPTION BUT BUT I DON'T MEAN THAT I MEAN JUST ON THE POINT OF VIEW OF HOW AN INDIVIDUAL DESCRIBED THEMSELVES AND IDENTIFIES THEMSELVES INDEED IN LIBERAL SOCIETIES THE TRUTH IS WE ALL HAVE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES I AM A MUSLIM BUT I'M NOT ONLY A MUSLIM THAT'S MY POINT I'M BRITISH I'M A PAKISTANI DESCENT I'M HER FATHER I'M HER HUSBAND
SO WE ALL HAVE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY FOR THOSE TO BE MAINTAINED IN THAT YOU DON'T ONLY SEE ME AS A MUSLIM BUT RATHER YOU SEE ME AS SOMEBODY THAT HAS VARIOUS INTERESTS ACROSS THAT THE SPECTRUM AND I DON'T ONLY VOTE ON THAT BASIS YOU KNOW I CARE ABOUT THE N.H.S. BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THE N.H.S. NOT BECAUSE I'M A MUSLIM AND PROFESSOR DOORMEN THE WAY WE ARE THE WAY PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO WHAT HAPPENED IN BRUSSELS THE WAY WE MIGHT RESPOND HERE DO YOU THINK IT COULD MAKE FURTHER ATTACKS MORE LIKELY AS MAGIC NOW OURS SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING
I THINK HOW WE RESPOND BUT POTENTIALLY PLAYS INTO THE WHOLE NARRATIVE OF WHAT ICE WANTS TO SAY AND THE LANGUAGE COMING OFF A BLUE LIGHT OR TRUMPET REINFORCES THAT INNES THERE'S A TENDENCY TOWARDS RISE OF RIGHT WING GROUPS HAVE SEPARATE THE SEPARATIST GROUPS THAT JUST PLAYS INTO THE NARRATIVE OF
WHAT ICE WILL BE ABOUT IT SIS IT'S THEM AND US AND IT WILL PLAY TO DIVISION AND BREAKDOWN OF OUR SOCIETY O.K. SO JUST A FINAL WORD IMAGINING WIRES IN TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WELL WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE IS AN IDEOLOGY A PLAY WITHIN MY OWN MUSLIM COMMUNITIES ACROSS EUROPE WE NEED TO CHALLENGE THAT IDEOLOGY AND WE NEED TO WORK AS GOVERNMENTS ON A POLICY LEVEL WITH COMMUNITIES TO EMPOWER AND STRENGTHEN THE NARRATIVE AGAINST THE ISLAMIST EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY AND SUPPORT REFORMING MUSLIM VOICES AND SECULARISM
