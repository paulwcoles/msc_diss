I NEED TO SHOW THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT IS IN TREASON AND HAS DIMINISHED ALL BASIC RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES WITH THE SECULAR DEMOCRACY WHICH IS BASED ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS BEEN ANNULLED
A BRITISH JOURNALIST BASED IN ANKARA LIVES KOOPMAN SPOKE TO THE B. B. C. AS GOVERNMENT FORCES BATTLED TO REGAIN CONTROL WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SHOTS BEING FIRED AROUND WHERE I AM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR IT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FIGHTER JETS GOING OVERHEAD AND MAYBE HALF AN HOUR AGO THERE A LOT OF EXPLOSIONS GOING ON IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY FROM WHERE I AM EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN SO WE'VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IT'S JUST TURNED INTO MAYHEM
PRESIDENT HER DUAN WAS ON A FAMILY HOLIDAY WHEN NEWS OF THE COUP ATTEMPT BROKE HE FLEW IMMEDIATELY TO ISTANBUL'S MAIN AIRPORT WHERE HE SAID THOSE WHO TRIED TO SEIZE POWER WOULD PAY A HEAVY PRICE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND MORE THAN THIRTY SENIOR ARMY OFFICERS DISMISSED DOZENS OF SOLDIERS SURRENDERED ON THE BOSPHORUS BRIDGE IN ISTANBUL A CORRESPONDENT IN THE CITY KATIE WATSON HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE NIGHT'S DEVELOPMENTS
THE STREETS OF ISTANBUL WERE EERILY QUIET THIS MORNING BUT OVERNIGHT PLENTY OF PEOPLE CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT UDDER ONE OPPOSING WHAT HE CALLED AN ACT OF TREASON WHEN HE FIRST ARRIVED AT ISTANBUL'S AIRPORT FROM MUM OR US IN SOUTH WEST TURKEY US GETTING THAT IT WASN'T
THIS IS A MINORITY WITHIN THE ARMY IN TURKEY AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THERE IS AN ELECTED PRESIDENT IN WE ARE IN CHARGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DUTY UNTIL AT THE END WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN OVERNIGHT MILITARY JETS WERE HEARD FLYING LOW IN BOTH ANKARA AND ISTANBUL THEY WERE ALSO SPORADIC EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE THIS MORNING LOCAL TELEVISION HAS BEEN SHOWING PICTURES OF SOLDIERS ON THE BOSPHORUS BRIDGE IN ISTANBUL SURRENDERING
THE PRESIDENT EARLIER SAID ACTION WAS BY A SO CALLED PARALLEL STRUCTURE A TIME HE'S USED IN THE PAST TO REFER TO TWO LOCAL AND A CLERIC BASED IN THE U.S. WHO HE ACCUSES A FOMENTING UNREST THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS THE SITUATION IS LARGELY UNDER CONTROL AND HAS ORDERED THE MILITARY TO SHOOT DOWN AIRCRAFT BEING USED BY THOSE WHO'VE TRIED TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY HE'S ALSO CALLED FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY PARLIAMENTARY SESSION LATER TODAY BUT DESPITE THE STATEMENTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE SITUATION REMAINS UNCLEAR
THE FOREIGN OFFICE HAS URGED BRITISH PEOPLE IN TURKEY TO STAY INDOORS AND REMAIN VIGILANT THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY EMPHASISED AMERICA'S SUPPORT FOR TURKEYS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS A SENTIMENT ECHOED BY GERMANY RUSSIA SAID IT WANTED TO SEE TURKEY RETURN TO THE PATH OF STABILITY AND ORDER
SPEAKING AT A CONFERENCE IN MONGOLIA ONE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S MOST SENIOR OFFICIALS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID THE TENSIONS IN TURKEY COULDN'T BE RESOLVED BY GUNS
THE POLICE ARE NOT HAPPY LET GO ON THERE YOU SHOULD ALL BE HELPING YOU
TURKEY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES OF THE WEST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MAIN BACKERS OF OPPONENTS OF THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT SAID THE PRESIDENT AIR DO AND HAS ANGERED MANY IN HIS COUNTRY BY TRYING TO MAKE TURKEY LESS SECULAR A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES ROBINS CONSIDER SOME OF THEIR GRIEVANCES THAT MAY LIE BEHIND THE COUP ATTEMPT
MY ONE STANDS ACCUSED OF CRUSHING POLITICAL OPPOSITION IMPRISONING DISSIDENT MILITARY COMMANDERS AND JOURNALISTS CLOSING NEWSPAPERS AND SEEKING TO DEMONISE ALL KURDISH SEPARATIST NOT JUST EXTREMISTS WHO USE VIOLENCE
THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ALWAYS SEEN THEMSELVES AS GUARDIANS OF SECULARISM THEY REGULARLY INTERVENED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WITH COUPS TO RESTORE WHAT THEY SAW AS BALANCE IN TURKISH SOCIETY BUT THIS LATEST INTERVENTION WILL CAUSE ALARM IN MANY WORLD CAPITALS IF IT DOESN'T END WITH THE STABLE TURKEY
THE COUNTRY A VITAL MEMBER OF THE NATO WESTERN MILITARY ALLIANCE IS SEEN AS A CRUCIAL BUFFER AGAINST WIDESPREAD TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THE EUROPEAN UNION VALUES IT'S DEAL WITH TURKEY TO PREVENT MANY MIGRANTS FROM GETTING INTO AND THEN STAYING IN E.U. COUNTRIES BUT TURKEY'S EFFORTS TO JOIN THE E.U. AS A MEMBER EVENTUALLY HAVE BEEN PUT ON ALMOST INDEFINITE HOLD PRECISELY BECAUSE MANY E.U. STATES BELIEVE TURKEY IS SLIPPING FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES NEEDED TO QUALIFY
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA SAY THEY'VE AGREED CONCRETE STEPS TO RESTORE THE CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA BUT NO DETAILS OF THE PLAN HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC IT'S THOUGHT RUSSIA WILL PUT PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT ASAD TO HOLD THE BOMBING OF REBEL HELD AREAS THERE WILL BE COORDINATED ACTION AGAINST MILITANT GROUP THE SYRIAN BRANCH OF OUR KINDER
FRANCIS STARTING THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE LORRY ATTACK IN NICE EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE SITTING ON THURSDAY NIGHT TEN OF THEM WERE CHILDREN MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE ARE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION IN HOSPITAL THE DEAD AND INJURED CAME FROM MANY COUNTRIES THE LORRY DRIVER HAS BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED AS A FRENCH TUNISIAN MAN WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD BUT KNOWN KNOWN LINKS TO HIS ISLAMIST EXTREMISM OR CORRESPONDENT LUCY WILLIAMSON IS IN NICE
WHAT MADE MUHAMMAD BULL ELK KILLED A FATHER OF THREE WITH A TROUBLED MARRIAGE AND A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND PETTY THEFT NEIGHBOURS DESCRIBED HIM AS STRANGE AND A LONER BUT FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAD NOT SEEN HIM AS A SECURITY RISK
THE STORIES OF HIS VICTIMS HAVE ALSO STARTED TO EMERGE SMILING OUT FROM INTIMATE FAMILY SNAPS SHAUN COPELAND FROM TEXAS WITH HIS ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON A FRENCH TOBACCONIST'S TIMOTHY WHO GAVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT HIS PREGNANT WIFE TWENTY YEAR OLD RUSSIAN STUDENT VICTORIOUS HAVE CINCO TWO PUPILS ON A SCHOOL TRIP FROM BERLIN THE LIST GROWS A LITTLE LONGER ALL THE TIME
ALONGSIDE THEIR PORTRAITS OTHER NAMELESS IMAGES OF LOSS HAVE BEGUN TO DEFINE THIS ATTACK THE PAINFUL VIGIL OF A GRIEVING RELATIVE SITTING IN THE EMPTY STREET HEAD BOWED
A CHILD'S BODY COVERED WITH A SIMPLE SHEET LIFELESS NEXT TO A DISCARDED DOLL
THREE MORE MINISTERS HAVE LEFT THE GOVERNMENT AS THERESA MAY CONTINUES HER RESHUFFLE THEY INCLUDE THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY ALTMAN AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER REPORTS FROM WESTMINSTER
IN A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER LAST NIGHT LADY ALTMAN SAID SHORT TERM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS EXACERBATED BY THE E.U. REFERENDUM HAS INHIBITED GOOD POLICY MAKING AND CALLED FOR MAJOR REFORMS OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING MORE HELP FOR WOMEN HIS STATE PENSION AGE HAS INCREASED AT SHORT NOTICE
ANOTHER OUTSPOKEN MINISTER SUE BREE SAID SHE'D RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPRESS HER VIEWS ON THE POSITIVE BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION AND THE E.U. ED VAIZEY AN OLD FRIEND OF DAVID CAMERON'S IS ALSO OUT AS THERESA MAY PROMOTES MORE OF HER OWN CLOSE ALLIES
A MENTAL HEALTH TRUST IN LONDON HAS BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION AFTER A PREGNANT HOSPITAL PATIENT WAS ALLEGEDLY DRAGGED FROM HER SEAT AND PINNED TO THE FLOOR BY THREE MEMBERS OF STAFF AN EYEWITNESS SAID THE WOMAN HAD BEEN VERBALLY BUT NOT PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE SHE WAS BRUISED BUT HER BABY WAS UNHARMED IN THE INCIDENT LAST SUNDAY A MEMBER OF STAFF HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM CLINICAL DUTIES
THE TIME NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET US GO FIRST TO THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT IN TURKEY AND TRY TO GET THEM IN SOME KIND OF ORDER THE FIRST SIGNALS THAT SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING SOMETHING WAS AFOOT WAS THEIR SOUND AND INDEED THE SITE OF PLANES IN THE AIR SOME OF THEM VERY LOW AND THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE
FILM MAKER OF CABBAGE IT WAS IN AND AROUND THE CENTRE OF ISTANBUL AND TAX IN SQUARE BENEATH THE WIRING IT JET WITH THE JEFF THE PERFECT OVERHEAD IN THE POLICE
THEY FULL BLOWN CONFLICT HAPPENING IN FRONT OF OUR EYES BETWEEN THE STATES MILITARY
STATE POLICE FORCES AND THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT PRESIDENT ADDRESS THE COUNTRY FROM AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION VIA A FACE TIME VIDEO CALL THAT WAS SHOWN ON TELEVISION
OH I DON'T UP YOU'RE IT I DON'T BELIEVE THIS COUP ATTEMPT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CHAIN OF COMMAND HERE RIGHT NOW THE CHAIN OF COMMAND HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD I URGE THE TURKISH PEOPLE TO CONVENE AT PUBLIC SQUARES AND AIRPORTS AND NEVER BILLY'S GONNA POWER FIRES IN THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE REJECT THE CASTELLANO AS A PHOTO JOURNALIST WHO LIVES IN ANKARA
I CAN SEE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ARE STOCKPILING BUTTER LAYING UP IN ANY AGE IT'S NOT ON A MAIN ROAD ON HIS THROAT AND EVERY MELON DOWN THERE ARE STILL A F. SIXTEEN FLYING VERY VERY LOW AND VERY VERY FAST OVER THERE SEETHING HE'S GOING TO A LOWER ROOF
BUT IT WAS BECOMING OBVIOUS AT THAT POINT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT PRESIDENT ADDER ONE'S SUPPORTERS WERE SENSING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FACE DOWN THE COUP AND THERE WAS CHEERING AT ISTANBUL AIRPORT WHEN THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF FINALLY MANAGED TO LAND HIS PLANE
LISTEN
OH SAYS WHAT IS BEING PERPETRATED IS A TREASON AND REBELLION THEY WILL PAY A HEAVY PRICE FOR THIS ACT OF TREASON THAT TURKEY HAS A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT WE ARE IN CHARGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE EXERCISING OUR POWER UNTIL THE END
WE WILL NOT ABANDON OUR COUNTRY TO THESE INVADERS IT WILL END WELL SHIRLEY WELL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE OVER YET BUT THAT EFFORT TO REGAIN CONTROL SEEMS TO BE ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS WORKING AND IN TAX HIM SQUARE MENTIONED EARLIER IN ISTANBUL THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ESCORTING SOLDIERS AWAY
THE MILITARY NOW THEY SEEM TO BE MOVING TOWARDS THE POLICE IMPACTS BACK THEY APPEAR TO BE GETTING ON A POLICEMAN LET'S TALK LIKE THAT KATIE WHAT'S A CORRESPONDENT IN ISTANBUL WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT KATE
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO COME BACK ON THE STREETS THERE WAS A CURFEW IMPOSED THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE DARING TO BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SHOPS OPENING AND PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT ON THE STREETS THERE ARE CARS DRIVING BUT STILL IT'S PRETTY QUIET NOW THE FIGURES WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BOTH CIVILIANS AND MILITARY AND AT LEAST SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND WE'VE SEEN
THE BOSPHORUS BRIDGE THERE'VE BEEN SOME SOLDIERS WHO HAD SURRENDERED AS WELL AS THAT TURKISH TELECOMS AND OTHER SOLDIERS HAVE SURRENDERED SO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT IT'S GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL THERE WILL BE A PARLIAMENTARY EXTRAORDINARY SESSION IN PARLIAMENT LATER TODAY IN ANKARA SAY THERE WILL BE A BIT MORE CLARITY PERHAPS AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY BUT IS THERE ANY FIGHTING ACTUALLY STILL GOING ON OR IS IT
THAT IT'S STILL VERY UNCLEAR I THINK YOU KNOW THERE SEEMS TO BE FAR MORE CONTROL CERTAINLY THE CLASHES OVERNIGHT WE SAW PARLIAMENTARY PRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN ANKARA ATTACKED AND HAVE PICTURES RUNNING ON LOCAL TELEVISION SHOWING THEIR ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION SOME OF THOSE BUILDINGS SO CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN A LULL THERE IN THE VIOLENCE OVERNIGHT WE SAW QUITE A BIT OVERNIGHT THEY WERE JETS HERE IN ISTANBUL AND ANKARA FLYING VERY LOW
SO THAT WAS A VERY IT WAS A VERY ACTIVE SITUATION BUT NOW THERE SEEMS TO BE SEEMS TO BE A RELATIVE CALM AND IT WAS THE POLICE WHO ACT FOR THE GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN THE MILITARY WHO SEEM TO HAVE MADE QUITE A DECISIVE DIFFERENCE I'M IN THE MOOD EXTRAORDINARY
PICTURES SHOWN ON ON VARIOUS TURKISH T.V. OUT LET'S HAVE THE POLICE ARRESTING SOLDIERS
YEAH AND THERE SEEMS TO BE IT IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SAID INITIALLY THIS WAS A SMALL PART OF THE MILITARY THAT WE HAD BIG CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY OF THE ARMED FORCES COMING OUT IN IN OPPOSITION SAYING THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS TAKEOVER AND THEY SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT SAY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING OUT SAYING THAT THIS THIS WASN'T A FULLY SUPPORTED COUP IN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF SAYING THAT THIS COULD BE CALLED A COUP SO CERTAINLY
THE FEELING HERE IS THAT IT PERHAPS HE'S HE'S DYING DOWN BUT CERTAINLY THERE WAS A LOT OF SURPRISE THAT THIS EVEN HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN THE NEWS BROKE LATE ON FRIDAY NIGHT PEOPLE HERE WERE VERY SHOCKED THAT THIS WAS EVEN HAPPENING TELL YOU WHAT'S IN FOR THE TIME BEING THANKS IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WERE LET'S GO TWO HUNDRED MILES FROM ISTANBUL TO THE CAPITAL ANKARA TO LYNNE DYNAMO IS FREELANCE JOURNALIST THERE A GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND CAN YOU BRING US UP TO DATE WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING
YOU KNOW I STILL HEAR JETS FLYING REALLY LOW A BROWN MY BUILDING HERE AND WE WALK UP TO THE SOUND OF THAT IT WAS PROBABLY YOU KNOW SIMON FOR ABOUT TWO TWO AND A HALF HOURS BUT THEY'RE BACK AGAIN SO THE GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS TAKEN UNDER CONTROL
AND THEN IT'S JUST IN A REALLY BIZARRE IT'S UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON BECAUSE THEY'RE SLAV US INFORMATION IS THAT RELIABLE FROM WHERE I LOOK AT DES DEEVIL ALLOTMENTS AND AND I DON'T KNOW WHO DO YOU BELONG TO HER RIGHT NOW THIS IS JUST
WE HAVE TO BE I THINK ALL VERY CAREFUL IN THE WAY HOW WE APPROACHED IT A DAY AND AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TAKING PLACE LAST NIGHT THE JETS THAT WERE FLYING OVER ANCHOR AND INDEED ISTANBUL WERE PART OF THE COUP ATTEMPT WEREN'T THEY ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WERE JETS THAT SHOT DOWN A HELICOPTER WHICH WAS PART OF THE
TWO AND WE ALSO KNOW THE GOVERNMENT HAD OR IT'S A DIFFERENT PART OF THE MILITARY ATTACHMENT THERE YOU KNOW POLICE FORCES THE SECURITY DIRECTORY TO TO TO TO COUNTER ATTACK THOSE MEMBERS BRAND THE MILITARY WHO ARE FLYING THESE DRY
AND AS AWARDS LADS TOOK OFF ROUND THE ESKY SHEER AIR BATTERIES AND A BED FOR AS FOR THE CIVILIANS WHEN THEY DID THAT THE FLOW OF INFORMATION REALLY NOT RELIABLE YOU'RE RIGHT NOW SO WE DO NOT KNOW WHO IS REALLY FLYING OVER MY BUILDING GREAT
BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT DAVE TAKEN UNDER CONTROL SO IF THEY'VE TAKEN UNDER CONTROLLED THIS SHOULD BE THE ADS THAT ARE FLYING UNDER ORDERS OF THE PRESIDENT
IS THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO ANSWER THAT WE KNOW THAT THE HEAD OF THE MILITARY THE CHIEF OF STAFF HAD BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE AND MOVED TO ONE OF THE AIR BASES HE THOUGH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN RESCUED
YES THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD WITHIN THE LAST HALF AN HOUR FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND HE HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO A SECURE PLACE AND THAT'S ALL WE KNOW ABOUT HIM AND KATIE WAS SAYING THAT THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING HAD BEEN ATTACKED WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THAT BLOWS MY MIND I REALLY CAN I GET MY HEAD AROUND THE FACT THAT THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT WAS BUT NOT ONCE NOT TWICE BUT THREE TIMES LAST NIGHT THAT'S BEYOND BELIEF I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS A JOURNALIST BUT AS A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY
I CAN'T GET IT IN MY HAT NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED SOME OF THE SOME OF THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BLAMED THE GLUE LEN MOVEMENT INSIDE THE MILITARY FOR THIS CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE
AND THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY DIRECTLY BLAINE'S DEATH SETTLE LAKIN AND OUR RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT TIPPY BEHIND DA'S ATTEMPTED COUP LAST NIGHT
THE PRESIDENT I SENSEI CAME TO PARVA IN TWO THOUSAND TUBE HE BASICALLY CAME TO PARVA IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND TREE ARE BAD AND HE HAD BEEN AND HIS PARTY HAD BEEN IN A MARY JUST CONVENIENCE WHIPPED GOOD MOMENT TO CONSULT A HARBOUR
BAD DAY FELL OUT DURING THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL OATH DECEMBER TWENTY THIRTEEN SINCE THEN ED IRON HAS DECLARED THE GLEN MOMENT A TERRORIST ORGANISATION AND NOUNS AND OUR BRIDE WORE A DAMNED STICK GURU
DICK'S HERE AS DAD YES WE KNOW THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN THE NAVY YOU KNOW REALLY VERY BIZARRE STAND OUT BY REALLY NO ONE HAD A THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE COME TODAY AS TO WHAT WE HAD WET NURSE LAST NIGHT RIGHT DOWN
TO TWO IN FIFTEEN DAYS THAT ALL GHOSTS SPREE MILITARY COUNCIL WILL NEED TO MAKE THE NEXT ROUND OF APPOINTMENTS FOR THE MILITARY AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE THEY EITHER FORCING THE GLEN US TO RETIRE OR TO ASK THEM SO
ERE DAWN SAYS THAT THIS WAS THEIR LAST CHANCE AND THEY USE THAT DOES SWAY SO ALLEGATIONS ARE REALLY UNBELIEVABLE AN UNHEARD OF IN THE HISTORY OF THIS REPUBLIC TO LEN DARLING OH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
LET'S AT TWENTY PAST SEVEN TURN TO B.B.C. WORLD SERVICE JOURNALISTS FOLLOWS EVENTS IN TURKEY VERY CLOSELY AND YOU'VE BEEN IN TOUCH IN FACT WITH THE PRESIDENT'S OWN STAFF GOING TO I WAS IN TOUCH WITH THEM AND I WAS ALSO IN TOUCH WITH THE SENIOR OFFICIALS WERE VERY CLOSE TO IN THE HEAT OFF THEY'RE DOING THE INCIDENT AND I CAN SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T SOUND VERY MUCH CONFIDENT AT THE BEGINNING
AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING SUCH A COOK YOU GET AT IT COULD TAKE PLACE BUT THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT IT COULD BE SUCH WELL ORGANISED APPARENTLY IT WAS VERY WELL ORGANISED MILITARY LEVELLED MANY STRONGHOLDS OF ADD ON SUPPORTERS INSIDE THE SECURITIES LIKE INTELLIGENCE HEADQUARTERS
TURKISH A SPECIAL FORCES THEY PRETTY SPECIAL FORCES AND ALSO OTHER AREAS WHERE HE DID DIRECTLY ATTACKED BY A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP SIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS IT THAT THEFTS PEOPLE THOUGHT WITH WE'VE LOST I DID THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE ILL WE THINK OF LOST BUT DID THEY SAID IT SOUTH CLEAR IT AND THEY PUT THE BLAME SQUARELY ON THE GLEN AND THEN I WAS ALSO IN TOUCH WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE U.S. THIS IS A U.S. BASED ISLAMIC ISLAMIC CLERIC
AND I ASKED THEM WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THIS YOU'VE BEEN BLAMED ABOUT THIS AND IN THEIR OFFICIAL STATEMENT THEY PUT THEY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THIS BUT WHEN I ASKED SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU CONDEMN THIS COUP ATTEMPT THEY KIND OF REFRAIN FROM DOING THAT
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD AND IT'S LIKE HE WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE STATEMENT THE MILITARY THE READ OUT BUT THAT THE LATEST THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PEOPLE AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE IT IS THAT THEY ARE BACK IN CONTROL THEY ARE BECKY THERE ARE LOTS OF INDICATIONS THAT THIS IS A FAILED COUP ATTEMPT TO TURKEY FACED FOR SUCCESSFUL COUPS IN RECENT HISTORY SINCE NINETEEN SIXTIES
AND ARE SEVERAL A FAILED COUP SAYS WELL THE LAST COUP WAS A SOFT CREW IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THIS WAS LIKE ALMOST THE BLOODIEST IN THE SENSE THAT ARE ONE A GOOD PROSECUTOR FORCES ATTACK AGAINST ANOTHER GROUP OF SECURITY FORCES THIS IS A FIRST IN TURKISH HISTORY
AND IT IS HAPPENING UNDER A GOVERNMENT WHO HAS FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME CONTROL OVER SECURITY MILITARY SERVICES THERE IS QUITE A RESENTMENT IN THE MILITARY IN ESPECIALLY THE LOWER RANKS TOWARDS DEE HIYA HI COMMENT THERE BECAUSE THEY THINK THE HIGH COMMAND DIDN'T STOOD UP FOR THERE'S SOLDIERS WHEN THEY WERE TRIED FOR A COUP ATTEMPT THERE SEVERAL YEARS AGO
SO IN THAT SENSE THIS IS THAT KIND OF A DOUBLE COUP AND BOTH AGAINST IRISH ISLANDS OF THE TURKISH MILITARY BUT ALSO AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING REMOVED FROM POWER HADN'T LOST THE KIRK ON THE COLONEL LEVELLED AND SAID THERE ARE SOME GENERALS INCLUDED WHICH SUGGESTS TO ME THAT IT MAY NOT SOLELY GOOD ELEMENT
IT'S GOOD BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BE INFILTRATED ON THAT LEVEL DISTAL WHITE KAY GOOD FOR THE TIME BEING THANK YOU BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO YOU I HOPE A COUPLE TIMES MORE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME AND EXPLORE NOT ONLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED BUT WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NOW SHE'S COURSE EQUALLY IMPORTANT GOOD NEIL THIS THANKS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN WILL RETURN TO TURKEY OF COURSE BUT AN AWFUL LOT GOING ON AT THE MOMENT NOT LEAST WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FRANCE WHICH IS OF COURSE STILL REELING FROM THURSDAY'S TRUCK ATTACK IN NICE
THE PRIME MINISTER MANUEL VALVES ARE SAID THE MAN WHO DROVE HIS TRUCK INTO CROWDS KILLING EIGHTY FOUR WAS A TERRORIST AND PROBABLY LINKED TO RADICAL ISLAM LUCY WILLIAMSON OUR CORRESPONDENT IS IN NICE AND LUCY WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED THIS
WE'VE LEARNT VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED HIM THERE ARE BITS AND PIECES OF INFORMATION COMING OUT ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LIVE HE WAS A MAN OF TUNISIAN EXTRACTION HE LIVED HERE IN THE EAST HAD THREE CHILDREN THE SOMEWHAT TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS WIFE BY ALL ACCOUNTS AND NEIGHBOURS AND PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM HERE GIVE A PICTURE OF SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T QUITE FIT IN THEY'VE DESCRIBED THEM AS BEING STRANGE A BIT OF A LONER SOMEONE WHO WOULD EASILY LOSE HIS TEMPER WHO WOULDN'T SAY HELLO TO YOU IF YOU GREETED HIM IN THE STREET BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS ATTACK AND THAT REALLY IS A BIG BLACK HOLE OF INFORMATION AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS COUNTRY'S RESPONDING VERY STRONGLY INDEED TO WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN NICE BUT IT IS
THE THIRD MAJOR ATTACK IN FRANCE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHERE THIS FITS INTO THE PICTURE OF ISLAMIC TERRORISM HERE AND THE DEATH TOLL EIGHTY FOUR WHICH IS WHAT IT WAS YESTERDAY MORNING BUT GIVEN WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES IT SEEMS ALMOST SADLY INEVITABLE IT WILL GO UP
THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE YES WE WERE TOLD YESTERDAY BY THE PRESIDENT THAT OF THE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED HERE MORE THAN FIFTY WE'RE IN A VERY SERIOUS CONDITION TWENTY FIVE OF THEM ARE ON LIFE SUPPORT SO YES I THINK VERY SADLY THAT DEATH ON LIKE HIS RISE LIZZIE WILLIAMS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH

PROTESTS IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA ISTANBUL FOLLOWED AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY A SECTION OF THE ARMED FORCES THAT THEY'D TAKEN CONTROL ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY AND SECULARISM SPORADIC EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE WERE HEARD IN BOTH CITIES THE PARLIAMENT AND PRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WERE ATTACKED IN ANKARA OFFICIALS CERTAINLY SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED MOST OF THEM CIVILIANS ARE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED HAVE BEEN ARRESTED MAINLY SOLDIERS WHO'D TAKEN PART IN THE COUP
TURKISH MEDIA SAY THE HEAD OF ARMED FORCES HAS BEEN RESCUED AFTER BEING HELD HOSTAGE DURING THE ATTEMPTED CUE MY DYLAN WAS ON HOLIDAY ON TURKEY'S MEDITERRANEAN COAST AND FLEW TO ISTANBUL OVERNIGHT HE'S WORN THOSE INVOLVED THAT THEY'LL PAY A HEAVY PRICE
THE FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS BOND WILL CHAIR A MEETING OF HIS SECURITY CABINET TO DISCUSS RESPONSE TO THE LORRY ATTACK IN NICE THE COUNTRY AS OBSERVING THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING FOR THE EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED
UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA SAY THEY'VE AGREED MEASURES TO RESTORE THE CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA BUT NO DETAILS OF THE PLAN HAD BEEN MADE PUBLIC IT'S THOUGHT THEY'LL COORDINATE AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE ISLAMIST GROUP AND RUSSIA WILL PUT PRESSURE ON PRESIDENT ASAD TO HOPE THE BOMBING OF OPPOSITION HELD AREAS
THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY OLDMAN HAS RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SHE SAID HER EFFORTS TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO PENSIONS HAVE BEEN THWARTED BY SHORT TERM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THE BUSINESS MINISTER BRIE AND CULTURE MINISTER ED VAIZEY HAD BEEN SACKED BY THERESA MAY
A MENTAL HEALTH TRUST IN LONDON HAS REMOVED A MEMBER OF STAFF FROM CLINICAL DUTIES AFTER A PREGNANT PATIENT WAS ALLEGEDLY DRAGGED FROM HER SEAT AND PINNED TO THE FLOOR SHE WAS BRUISED BUT HER BABY WAS UNHARMED IN THE INCIDENT LAST SUNDAY
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TURN STRAIGHT TO EVENTS IN TURKEY AND WE CAN HEAR FIRST FROM RAT YET KIM WHO IS THE EDITOR OF IN CHIEF OF THE HARRIETTE NEWSPAPER THEIR OFFICERS WERE OCCUPIED OVERNIGHT FOR A TIME BY TURKISH SOLDIERS IN ISTANBUL GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
WHEN YOU SAY NOT TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL ARE YOU AWARE OF FIGHTING THAT IS STILL GOING ON ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY
THE DIRECT HOUGHTON WAS THE EQUAL TRAP A MAJOR AIRPORTS
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US WE CAN TURN TO FUDDY HOW COOL WHO IS HERE AND WHO IS TURKEY ANALYST AT CHATHAM HOUSE THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS THINK THAT MORNING TO YOU AND THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A COUP NOT BY THE ENTIRE ARMY BUT BY A SECTION ON IS THAT RIGHT IF THE SCHOOL WAS CARRIED OUT THIS COOK ATTEMPTS CARRIED OUT BY A VERY NARROW SEGMENT OF THE TURKISH MILITARY DID NOT ENJOY THAT BROUGHT SUPPORT OF THE TURKISH MILITARY MORDOR TURKISH PUBLIC AND CRITICALLY ALSO
THE TURKISH POLITICAL OPPOSITION PARTIES WHY NOT I THINK THAT THE ERA THAT THE MOST TURKS ARE TIRED OF COUPS AT LEAST THE FOUR CREWS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN TURKEY OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS OR TURKS NOW A HAVE A POSITIVE VIEW OF THE MILITARY BUT DO NOT WANT THE MILITARY TO INTERVENE IN TURKEY'S POLITICAL LIFE
BUT WAS THIS YEAR AT HEART DO YOU THINK AN EFFORT BY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY AND BELIEVE IN TURKEY'S SECULAR
STATUS TRYING TO OVERTHROW ED ARE ONE IN A SENSE FOR THOSE MOTIVES OR WAS IT SOMETHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE REALLY DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE MOTIVES OF THIS GROUP WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE STATEMENT THAT THEY ARE RELEASED CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE PURSUING FROM DISCO ATTEMPT TO RESTORE SECULAR DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY TOO
TO DO IT TO HER TO RESTORE HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES SO AT LEAST THIS SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE MAY BE UNHAPPY WITH PRESENT AIR DO ONE'S ATTEMPTS ARE TRYING TO CENTRALISE
POWER IN BY ESTABLISHING A EGGS A STRONG AND POWERFUL EXECUTIVE A PRESIDENCY AND WHAT DOES THIS DO NOW TO HIS PA ASSUMING THAT HE HAS SURVIVED THIS IT LOOKS AS IF HE PERSONALLY CERTAINLY HASN'T HE SAYS THIS MORNING THAT HE'S IN CHARGE WHAT DOES IT DO FOR TURKEY I THINK THAT IN THE SHORT TERM IT WILL STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION PERHAPS EVEN
EMPOWER HIM TO TRY TO PUSH AHEAD WITH TRANSFORMING TURKEY IN A STRONG AND POWERFUL EXECUTIVE
PRESIDENCY BUT UNDER LONGER TERM I THINK BUT IN THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM I THINK THE KEY ISSUE WILL BE WHAT IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE TURKISH ECONOMY WILL IT SCARE OFF
TURKISH FOREIGN INVESTORS WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO FUNDING TURKEY'S ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT'S NOW GOING TO BE THE KEY QUESTION AND THE OTHER ONE OF COURSE FOR OTHER COUNTRIES OUTSIDE TURKEY AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND SEE TURKEY AS A VERY KEY ALLIANCE
WHAT ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERYONE ASSUMING THAT HE IS STILL IN CHARGE I THINK THEY HAVE A VERY FICKLE AND DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT AIRED THE ONE BUT THEY HAVE TO CO OPERATE WITH HIM GIVEN TURKEY'S THEIR STRATEGIC DUEL DUE STRATEGIC POSITION BORDERING SYRIA AND IRAQ AND
IRAN I THINK THAT THE BIG D. IN THIS COOP FAILED COUP ATTEMPT WILL RAISE FURTHER QUESTIONS ON TURKEY'S LONG TERM A SECURITY AND STABILITY I MEAN TO PUT IT REALLY BLUNTLY
WOULD SOME PEOPLE BEHIND THE SCENES IN WASHINGTON AND PERHAPS IN OTHER CAPITALS AS WELL HAVE BEEN HOPING THAT THIS COUP WOULDA WORKED I DOUBT THAT I THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT LINE BY WASHINGTON BY BRUSSELS AND AT AND OTHER MAJOR EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES INCLUDING LONDON AND NOT THAT DESPITE THE DISAGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH THEIR PRESENT ERE DON'T THEY DO NOT SUPPORT EXTRA CONSTITUTIONAL METHODS TO REMOVE HIM TO WHAT EXTENT
THIS TURKEY DES PRESIDENT HEARD HER ONE PRESENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE HAND IN THE VARIOUS OTHER
WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CO OPERATE WITH TURKEY I'M THINKING PARTICULARLY OF THE BUSINESS OF THE MIGRANTS IN THE DEAL THAT WAS RECENTLY DUMPED HER IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND AND TURKEY OVER THEM DEAD I MEAN IT IS EARLY ONCE SUFFICIENTLY IS KATE GOING TO BE SUFFICIENTLY IN CHARGE THAT THEY THAT HE CAN BE A PROPER PARTNER FOR THEM AND I DON'T KNOW YEARS AHEAD
I THINK THAT FOR THE SHORT TERM PRESENT THEIR ADONIS SUFFICIENTLY IN CHARGE AND THIS FEAR FAILED COUP PLOT DEMONSTRATES THAT HE STILL HAS HIS TAIL HAS A VERY STRONG HOLD ON THE REINS OF POWER IN TURKEY I THINK THAT HOWEVER THE KEY QUESTION IS OH WE'LL WILT THE RECENT EVENTS OR DAMAGE AT THE TURKISH ECONOMY
OR OVER TIME WHICH THEN MAY HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON HE'S A CONTINENT CALLED ON
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING I SHOULD JUST SAY REUTERS NEWS AGENCY SAYING NOW THE NUMBER OF DETAINED MILITARY PERSONNEL AFTER THE COUP ATTEMPT HAS RISEN TO MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF THOUSAND ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WELL IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS BUT OF COURSE NEWS THIS WEEK SEEMS TO BE MOVING SO FAST THAT THE EARLY EDITIONS HAVE BEEN QUICKLY OUT OF DATE THE LATER ADDITIONS THOUGH DO MANY OF THEM HAVE THE NEWS ABOUT THE COUP IN TURKEY IN THE TELEGRAPH ONE MAN IN ISTANBUL'S TAX HIM SQUARE TELLS THE PAPER THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT SO BAD A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECTED A MILITARY TAKEOVER THE PAPERS THERE'S THE ACTION COULD BE SEEN AS A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT AFTER RECENT ATTACKS BY THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE GUARDIAN REPORT SOME TURKS RUSH TO STOCKPILE FOOD AND WATER AND WITHDRAW CASH BECAUSE OF FEARS OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE MELTDOWN IN THE DAYS AHEAD STARK IMAGES OF THE DEAD AND THE GRIEVING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ATTACK AND NICE DOMINATE MOST OF THE FRONT PAGES OF THE DAILY MAIL USES A PHOTOGRAPH OF EMPTY CHILDREN'S BUGGIES LEFT BEHIND IN THE CHAOS THAT SAYS THERE ARE CHILLING TESTAMENT TO THE MASSACRE IN WHICH AT LEAST TEN CHILDREN WERE KILLED
THE TIMES PRINCE A PICTURE OF A SMALL CHILD'S BODY INCENSE SAYS WAS CRUSHED WITHOUT MERCY AND BABY DOLL LYING NEARBY THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH USES THE SAME IMAGE DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED AS A MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS EVERY PAPER HAS PAGES OF DETAILED COVERAGE THE SUN SAYS THE SHORTENED DEPRESSING ANSWER TO WHETHER WE CAN PREVENT SIMILAR ATTACKS IN THE FUTURE IS WE CAN'T THE DAILY EXPRESS AGREES CALLING IT NIGH ON IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE PAPER ARGUES WE MUST NOT ALLOWED TERRORISTS TO SCARE US INTO CHANGING OUR WAY OF LIFE
THE TELEGRAPH LEADER COLIN SAYS THE ATTACK IS A REMINDER THERE ARE MUCH DEEPER PROBLEMS FACING THE WEST THAN BRECK'S IT IN FRANCE'S HOUR OF PAIN WE MUST OFFER ALL THE SUPPORT WE CAN IT ARGUES TO EXTRACT COULD EXTRICATE THE U.K. FROM THE E. U. IS ONE OF THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES FACING THERESA MAY ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES ALONGSIDE REUNITING A BITTERLY DIVIDED CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND SHE IS THE QUIET WOMAN OF POLITICS IS PLAYED THE LONG GAME AND TRIUMPH THE PAPER SAYS AND HER
RECORD IN GOVERNMENT HINTS AT HER APTITUDE FOR THE TASK ANDREW GRICE WRITING IN THE EYES SAYS THE SO CALLED NOTTING HILL SET OF TORIES HAVE RUN THE PARTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIRED A SEETHING AT THE SACKING OF THEIR TROOPS IN HER DRAMATIC CABINET RESHUFFLE CABBIE HIM SLIP IN THE GUARDIAN POINTS TO THE FACT THAT OVERNIGHT THE COOL KIDS HAVE BEEN REPLACED IN SOME CASES BY PEOPLE OLD ENOUGH TO BE THEIR PARENTS
A SURVEY OF THE OVER FIFTIES IN THE MIRROR AND THE EXPRESS DISPENSES PEARLS OF WISDOM FOR YOUNGER GENERATIONS AS WELL AS TELLING THE MORE USEFUL TO NEVER SMOKE AND LOOK AFTER THEIR TEETH THE LIFE LESSONS THEY SAID THEY WISHED THEY'D KNOWN AS TEENAGERS INCLUDED
READING MORE BOOKS PAYING OFF CREDIT CARDS EACH MONTH NOT CHEATING ON YOUR PARTNER AND NOT HAVING CHILDREN TO SAVE A RELATIONSHIP THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SPOTTED BY EVERYONE THAT A POKEMON CHARACTER WAS CAUGHT IN THE STANDS AT THROUGH THERE YESTERDAY ACCORDING TO THE SUN SINCE IT WAS LAUNCHED IN THE U.K. ON THURSDAY PLAYERS OF POKER MONGO WHICH INVOLVES USING A SMARTPHONE TO HUNT DOWN VIRTUAL CREATURES
SQUIRRELS AND JIGGLY PUFFS IN THE REAL WORLD I'VE CAUSED TO TERRORISM ALERT IN LEICESTER ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THEY HAVE LED TO SPECIALIST MINE RESCUE TEAM DOWN TO GO TO THE AID OF A GROUP OF TEENAGERS LOST IN CAVES IN WILTSHIRE THE GUARDING CALLS THE GAME A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN TWENTY YEARS IN THE MAKING VERSION HAVING STARTED ON GAME BOY CONSULS IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ON THIS WEEK'S MEET THE AUTHOR JIM MEETS THE JAMAICAN POET AND AUTHOR CHI MILLER AND TALKS ABOUT STORYTELLING MEMORY AND MAGIC
AUGUST IN CHI MILLER'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME IS AN IMAGINARY PLACE IN JAMAICA BUT IT'S QUITE REAL THE SOUNDS AND THE SMELLS THE VOICES IN THE STREET RING TRUE AND HIS POETIC STYLE
INFUSES THIS PLACE WITH A A KIND OF A GRITTY MAGIC VERY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE HERE THE PAST AND THE PRESENT ALWAYS OVERLAP
LEGEND AND SUPERSTITION OUT AS REAL TO PEOPLE AS THE FIERY POLITICS OF THE ISLAND AND MAYBE THE SMELL OF GUNGE IN THE STREETS IT'S A TOWN WHERE THEY STILL TELL STORIES OF THE PREACHER WHO COULD FLY AND WHERE WE LEARNED VERY EARLY IN THE BOOK THAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR ANOTHER
OR TO CLAPS AND THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO ASK YOU KIND MILLER IS TO EXPLAIN THAT WORD WHICH IS FAMILIAR TO ANYBODY WHO KNOWS JAMAICA WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS TO US MOST JAMAICANS WOULD TELL YOU IT'S DERIVED FROM APOCALYPSE IT'S ACTUALLY A FOURTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH DIALECT WORD AFTER CLAPPER I KIND OF BAD
THING THAT HAPPENS AFTER AN EVENT WAS PRESUMED TO BE CLOSE SO IT DEFINITELY IS A HORRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENS AFTER AGAIN ARGOS TONY SLIGHTLY FICTITIOUS BUT THERE IS A VERY REAL PLACE IN JAMAICA CALLED ARGOS TOWN IT'S CALLED AUGUST TIME BECAUSE THAT'S THE DAY THAT FREEDOM COMES
AUGUST THE FIRST EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEARNT TO BE DISAPPOINTED WHO HAVE LEARNT THAT THIS THING THAT HE'S COMING AT FIRST FREEDOM ISN'T FREEDOM AT ALL AND IT WILL TURN OUT VERY BADLY FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE IS COMING BECAUSE THEY'VE LIVED A LIFE WHERE EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROMISED DOESN'T TURN OUT
THE WITCH WELL THIS DISTILLERY THAT DOMINATES AUGUST TOWN IN KENT AND THIS TELLING OF OF ITS LIFE YEAH IS THE STORY OF THE PREACHER WHO COULD FLY THIS IS BASED ON A REAL MAN
THIS IS BASED ON ALEXANDER BED WOULD HAVE BEEN NINETEEN TWENTIES SAYS HE'S GOING TO FLY AND YOU NEED TO MAKE IS A VERY SWISH ALLIES A VERY CONFLICTED COUNTRY AT THE TIME AND AND EDWARD WHO EXIST AT THE SAME TIME AS MARCUS GARVEY THE TOUR THEY MY PREACHING THESE MESSAGES IN JAMAICA MARCUS GARVEY THAT IS THE ATHEISTS ARE CHANTING BLACK POWER
ALEXANDER BED WHERE IT IS IS THE KIND OF PREACHER MAN ALSO CHANTING BLACK POWER MARCUS GARVEY'S PHILOSOPHY CAN GET SO FAR AND NO MORE BECAUSE JAMAICA'S A RELIGIOUS COUNTRY AND BLACK POWER HAS TO BE EMBEDDED IN A KIND OF RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE FOR IT TO TAKE OFF AND FINALLY WIN BED WOODEN MARCUS GAVIN MEET WITH AND DOCTRINES MEAT
WE COME UP WITH RASTAFARI WHICH IS A KIND OF A MAGICAL THING THAT HAPPENS SO WITHOUT THE PREACHER WHO SAID HE COULD FLY THERE WOULD BE NO RASTAFARIANS ABSOLUTELY NIGHT HE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THESE TWO STREAMS HAVE TO MEET HER AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE AS WE TELL THE STORY OF MARCUS GARVEY A LOT WE DON'T TELL THE STORY OF BED ENOUGH
I THINK THAT'S QUITE UNFORTUNATE SO I WANTED TO KIND OF REHABILITATE HIM RECAPTURE THAT STORY KAI GIVE US A FLAVOUR OF LIFE IN AUGUST AND THE DISTANT PAST COMES BACK TO US USUALLY AS A SHOCK AND ECHO THAT HAS ESCAPED ITS OWN FLEETING NEST THAT HAS WIDENED SO WIDE AND SO QUICKLY WE HAVE SLIPPED INSIDE IT WITHOUT BEING ALREADY
IT COMES THEN AS A PANIC IN THE HEART A WIDENING OF THE EYES AND ALL OF THEIR MOUTH IN THE DAYS OF THE FLAME PREACHER MAN MIGHT HAVE HE WAS THE SAME AGE THAT CAR IS
IT DOES NOT SURPRISE HER THAT SHE WAS ONCE A LITTLE GIRL IT'S HER PRAISES HER ONLY THAT SHE'S NOW SO MANY YEARS AWAY FROM THAT TIME
IN THEM THERE LONG AGO DAYS THERE WAS A CHURCH HERE IN ARGOS TOWN MY TAFFY SAYS AS IF FROM FAR AWAY YOU HAVE BEEN WRITING FICTION FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW
BUT YOU'VE ALSO BEEN A POET YEAH A SUCCESSFUL PUT IT HOW DID THE TWO WRITING DISCIPLINES INTERACTING INURA MIND I STARTED WRITING FICTION I SAID WRITING STORIES
WHEN HE'S AT UNIVERSITY I STARTED WRITING POETRY AND I THOUGHT MY GOD IF HE CAN WRITE A HALF DECENT POEM I MAY WRITE A VERY GOOD STORE
AND SO I STARTED WRITING WRITING POETRY IN ORDER TO FEED FICTION AND POETRY TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN AT ONE POINT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT HAVING ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD CATEGORISE US
A SORT OF DISABILITY AS A PROBLEM IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU TURNED INTO
A BENEFIT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS WORLD THAT WHIZZES IN PHYSICS AROUND YOU DO YOU FIND IT
ACTUALLY HE'S TURNED OUT TO BE AN ADVANTAGE IT'S AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF MY PRODUCTIVITY HAS A VERY TOUGH LET'S ONLY DISTRACT MYSELF WITH ONE WRITING PRESENT IT BUY IT WITH ANOTHER WRITING PROJECT AND SO GENERALLY ARE PROBABLY HAVE THREE THINGS
ON THE GO WHICH IS WHICH IS USEFUL AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO DO BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY YOU ARE OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU ALSO WANT TO DO
YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN I WAS A KID IN JAMAICA THIS A PLAYWRIGHT CAME CAYMAN SAID A CAREER IN THE ARTS OR SOMETHING YOU SHOULD ONLY DO IF YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE AND IT WAS A MOST FREEING THING I EVER HEARD I THOUGHT HAVE I LITERALLY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE
SO THAT WAS ALWAYS I WAS ALWAYS A CAME OF FREEING WONDERFUL THING TO HEAR BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS I HOPE SO YEAH GOD I HOPE SO
KAI MILLER TALKING TO JIM IT'S NOW THIRTY MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN A LONDON STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL WHO PRIEST AT SAINT JOHN STICK WELL DIGS WELL IN WELWYN GARDEN CITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SARAH
LIKE MANY OF YOU I'M SURE A CLOUD OF OVERWHELMING HOPELESSNESS AND ENVELOPED ME YESTERDAY AS THE SHOCKING CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT PRESIDENT ALONG REFERRED TO AS VIOLENCE THAT IS ABSOLUTE GRADUALLY UNFOLDED IN NICE
THE PRESIDENT RIGHTLY SPOKE ABOUT SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS WERE YOUNG AND OLD OF ALL FAITHS AND BACKGROUNDS OF COURSE MANY PEOPLE WILL BE HOLDING THEM ESPECIALLY IN THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS THIS MORNING BUT WHAT ARE WE TO DO WHAT ARE WE TO THINK HOW WE HAD TO HOPE
THAT'S A KEY QUESTION THE MORAL PHILOSOPHER AND ATE THEY IMPOSED IN HER BOOK REFLECTIONS ON HOW WE LIVE WHAT IS THE PROPER PLACE OF HOPE IN HUMAN LIFE
BONE IS RUTHLESSLY HONEST IN ASSERTING THAT WHILST HOPE IS A NATURAL HUMAN TRAIT A LACK OF HOPE LEADS TO FEAR
EVEN IN DARK MOMENTS MY FAITH HELPS ME TO HOLD ONTO A SENSE OF HOPE EVEN WHEN WRESTLING WITH FEAR BUT THE QUESTIONS BOTH OF WHAT'S NEXT IN OUR OWN LIVES AND HOW TO RESPOND IT'S TERRIBLE EVENTS SUCH AS WHAT UNFOLDED IN NICE YESTERDAY MEANS THAT FEAR IS NEVER FAR FROM THE SURFACE
IT'S TRUE TO SAY THAT HOPE CERTAINLY UNDERPINS MUCH NEW TESTAMENT THEOLOGY JESUS'S MANTRA IS DO NOT BE AFRAID DO NOT FEAR PRAY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM EVIL WHY WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW TODAY'S TROUBLES ARE PLENTY ENOUGH
IT'S ON THIS BASIS THAT THE THRUST OF THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL IS THAT FAITH BRINGS HOPE WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOT YET SEEN UNTIL THE RESURRECTION AND THOUGH IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO HANG ON IN THERE TO SUCH HOPE WHEN DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN SIN AND EVIL THE CHALLENGE CERTAINLY IS TO TRY NEVERTHELESS
TO HIS CREDIT SIMPLE DOESN'T SHRINK FROM RECOGNISING THAT KEEPING THE FLAME OF HOPE FLICKERING WAS NOT EASY IN A WORLD WHICH FOR HIM INVOLVE SHOCKING ACTS OF HUMAN SAVAGERY IN AND AROUND THE ROMAN EMPIRE
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT ON A MORNING LIKE THIS ONE PAUL DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HOPE ON ITS OWN WAS SUFFICIENT
IN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PASSAGES HE EVER WROTE IN A LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS EXPLAINS HOW HOPE IS LINKED INTRINSICALLY TO BOTH FAITH AND LOV FAITH HOPE AND LOVE ABIDE WHO WRITES BUT THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE
IT'S HARD IT'S DIFFICULT
HOW CAN IT BE THAT AMONGST THE DEAD SO MANY CHILDREN COULD BE KILLED ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT HAPPY FAMILY DAY AND YET SOMEHOW WE MUST NOT FEAR
THE FLAMES OF HOPE REPRESENT IN THE MANY CANDLES LIT FOR THOSE WHO DIED IN THE EAST THAT MUST NEVER BE EXTINGUISHED OUR FREEDOM TO CHOOSE TO HOPE AND TO LOVE THAT COULD NEVER DIE AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE THE REVEREND DOCTOR ROB MARSHALL PRIEST AT SAINT JOHN'S TAKES WORK DIGS WELL IN WELWYN GARDEN CITY TIME IS STENTOR
THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SIR PAUL NURSE ONCE SCIENTISTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S BRECK'S IT NEGOTIATING TEAM HE SAYS THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY HAS MOST TO LOSE FROM THE U.K. LEAVING THE E.U. AND SCIENTIST CAN ARGUE MOST POWERFULLY FOR FUNDING TO BE PROTECTED WE WILL SPEAK TO HIM HE JUST A MOMENT FIRST THERE WAS A DEAD AT HER DUMB FIELD AND IT'S HERE WITH ME AND TOM I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT SCIENTISTS DID NOT WANT
THE U.K. TO LEVY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I MEANT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WERE IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND THERE ARE TWO MAIN REASONS FOR THAT I MEAN THE FIRST IS THE MONEY OBVIOUSLY WE GET MORE OUT THAN WE PUT IN IN TERMS OF RESEARCH FUNDING WITH A NET GAIN OF AROUND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND THE SECOND ONE IS FREE MOVEMENT
THE DAYS OF LUNE GENIUS IS SITTING IN A GARRET ALL BY THEMSELVES THINKING UP DEEP THOUGHTS COMING UP WITH A REVOLUTIONARY NEW IDEAS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE WHAT THOSE ARE LONG LONG GONE REALLY SCIENCE IS NOW A COLLABORATIVE VENTURE IN THE U.K. HAS THRIVED FREELY IN THIS IN THIS MODERN ERA EMERGING AS A SCIENTIFIC SUPERPOWER REALLY ABLE TO ATTRACT THE BEST BRAINS TO COME AND WORK IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES AND REALLY DOMINATING EUROPEAN SCIENCE AND I THINK
THAT'S PROBABLY THE REALLY STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THAT SCIENCE HAS FOR A SEAT AT THE BRICKS AT NEGOTIATING TABLE THAT IN THE MODERN WORLD WHERE THE ECONOMY IS BUILT ON KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE AND WE'RE NOT REALLY COMPETING AT MANUFACTURING WIDGETS ARE WITH CHEAP LABOUR THAT YOU NEED TO PUT THAT TO THE FOREFRONT OF AND WE'RE REALLY IN A STRONG POSITION THERE IN TERMS OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAINTAIN THAT TO PRESERVE IT INTO THE FUTURE TOM THANKS VERY MUCH WELL AS I SAY SIR PAUL NURSE WHOSE FORMER PRESS AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND RUNS THE FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE IN OXFORD JOINS US FROM OXFORD NOW COME ON
GOOD MORNING FAIR ACTUALLY I RUN IT IN LONDON NOT IN OCTO APOLOGIES NOW LOOK YOU MADE ALL THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE BENEFITS TO SCIENCE OF STAYING IN THE E.U. BEFORE THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE THAT WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT WAS LOST IN THE COUNTRY NOW THERE WILL BE A TEAM NEGOTIATING WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST DEAL FOR THE U.K. WHY SHOULD SCIENTIST BE IN THE ROOM
SCIENCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD DRIVES A PROSPERITY OUR HEALTH OUR QUALITY OF LIVES AND OF COURSE OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT IS CORE FOR BRITAIN'S FUTURE AND BECAUSE SCIENCE WAS SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE Y. Y. YOU IT'S VERY VULNERABLE TO EXIT SO IN MY VIEW IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT BOTH SCIENTISTS AND POLITICIANS WORK TOGETHER TO TRY AND ESTABLISH THE BEST DEAL
FOR SCIENCE IN THE FUTURE OUTSIDE THE E.U. COS THAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THE U.K. AS A WHOLE BUT IN A WAY THAT'S OBVIOUS ISN'T IT YOU'RE ACTUALLY ARGUING THAT THOUGH THAT YOU SHOULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH THE NEGOTIATORS I THINK THAT YOU NEED SCIENCE VERY CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATION
PARTLY TO GET IT UP THERE ON THE AGENDA PARTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY GOOD CONTACTS IN THE Y. YOU BOTH WITH SCIENTISTS THERE AND ALSO WITH POLITICIANS I PERSONALLY LED A DELEGATION TO MEET YONKERS FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT RESULTED IN RESTORATION OF A MAJOR CHUNK OF THE SCIENCE BUDGET WE CAN IMPACT THIS DEBATE IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY
AND WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN LOST CAN BE DELIVERED EFFECTIVELY TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION TO PROCLAIM MOAT MOBILITY WHICH WE REALLY NEED SEAN TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE FRONT O.K. CLOSE TO IN THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD BE IN THE ROOM OR SOME SCIENTIST SHOULD BE IN THE ROOM I AM SAYING WE'VE GOT GOOD POLITICAL LEADERS HERE WHO KNOW THE AREA GREG CLARK AND WE'VE HEARD THAT JOE JOHNSON MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND UNIVERSITIES HAS JUST BEEN APPOINTED
THESE UNDERSTAND HOW SCIENCE IS DONE THEY ARE COMMITTED TO SCIENCE AND WHAT IT CAN DELIVER WHAT I'M ARGUING IS THAT WITH SCIENTISTS THERE TWO WHO CAN PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE AND THE WAY OF WORKING TO MAKE THEIR NEGOTIATIONS MORE EFFECTIVE IS THE WAY TO GO ALTHOUGH BUSINESSES COULD SAY THAT ANY OTHER SECTOR COULD SAY THAT I'M SURE THE OTHER SECTORS ARE AND I SUSPECT THEY WILL BE CLOSE TO THE NEGOTIATION
THE PROBLEM YOU'RE ASKING TO BE SORRY FORGIVE YOUR ARSE ME BE THERE I JUST WONDER WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DON'T TRUST THE POLITICIAN ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT SCIENCE AND RESEARCH CAN BE LEFT BEHIND IT CAN BE LEFT OUT OF THE ROOM SO WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE AND SECONDLY WE CAN HELP OUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND WE CAN HELP THE Y. YOU POLITICAL LEADERS AND SCIENTISTS TO ACTUALLY GET THE BEST DEAL AND TO GET SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK AND FOR YOU THAT MEANS
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR SARDIS IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS WE NEED TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION WITH YOU COLLEAGUES IT MEANS MOBILITY FREE MOBILITY OF THESE HIGHLY TRAINED SCIENTISTS AT THE CRICK INSTITUTE THAT YOU MENTION FIFTY SIX PER CENT OF THE POST DOCTORAL WORKERS THAT'S PEOPLE WITH P.H.D.S HIGHLY TRAIN COMPANY Y. YOU THIS IS A BIG HOLE UNLESS WE CAN PLUG IT
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY EFFECTS FROM BRECK'S IT ALREADY WE'RE HEARING ANECDOTAL EFFECTS I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO SEE HOW THEY COME OUT WE HEARING BUT SOME OF THE NETWORKS ARE THINKING THAT HAVING THE U.K. PERSON INVOLVED MAY JEOPARDISE THEIR ABILITY TO WIN MONEY WE'RE HEARING OR PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS
I THINKING OF LEAVING OR PERHAPS WOULDN'T COME TOO EARLY TO SAY YET BUT THERE IS A DEFINITE LEAD VERY UNSETTLED ATMOSPHERE ACROSS THE WHOLE RESEARCH ENDEAVOUR WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT AS TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS COLLABORATING IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AS THE TEAMS ARE BEING PUT TOGETHER THEIR THINKING LEAVE OUT THE U.K. TEAM BECAUSE THEY MAY IT MAY AFFECT OUR FUNDING ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
ALREADY ALREADY WE'RE HEARING THOSE RUMOURS NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR EVIDENCE ROW THIS IS SCIENCE WE RELY ON EVIDENCE SO IT'S TOO EARLY TO CALL BUT THERE IS A DEFINITE RISK THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BUT WE ARE STILL IN THE E.U. AND WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN ASSURED NOT LEAST BY JOE JOHNSON WHO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THE SCIENCE MINISTER THAT NOTHING WOULD CHANGE AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEAR OF COURSE
BUT THE E. BUT THIS IS CONSISTS OF PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP NETWORKS IF YOU'RE PUTTING A GRANT APPLICATION INTO THE E.U. AND YOU THINK THAT MAYBE HAVING SOMEBODY FROM BRITAIN WILL AFFECT ADVERSELY YOU'LL THINK TWICE ABOUT WHETHER YOU TALK TO THEM IT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE FROM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER YOU JUST IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT EXACTLY THE SITUATION AS
AS IF WE WERE STILL A PART OF THE E.U. FOR THIS ONE SECTOR B. E. WITH VERY VERY GOOD FOR BRITISH SCIENCE AND IT ALLOWED US TO TACKLE TO GET ACCESS TO A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGHLY TRAINED SCIENTISTS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THE U.K. ALONE IN HER LOUDEST PROMOTE COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS AND IT ALLOWED US TO HAVE NEW VERY EFFECTIVE MONEY
ALL OF THAT IS AT RISK IT CAN BE DEALT WITH BUT IT NEEDS POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO DO SO AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR TODAY SIR PAUL NURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

PRESIDENT HEARD WHEN WAS ON A FAMILY HOLIDAY WHERE NEWS OF THE COUP ATTEMPT BROKE HE FLEW IMMEDIATELY TO ISTANBUL'S MAIN AIRPORT WHERE HE SAID THOSE WHO TRIED TO TOPPLE HIM WOULD PAY A HEAVY PRICE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN DETAINED OR MORE THAN THIRTY SENIOR ARMY OFFICERS DISMISSED DOZENS OF SOLDIERS SURRENDERED ON THE BOSPHORUS BRIDGE IN ISTANBUL A CORRESPONDENT IN THE CITY KATIE WATSON HAS BEEN FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS
THE STREETS OF ISTANBUL WERE EERILY QUIET THIS MORNING BUT OVERNIGHT PLENTY OF PEOPLE CAME OUT IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT OPPOSING WHAT HE CALLED AN ACT OF TREASON WHEN HE FIRST ARRIVED AT ISTANBUL'S AIRPORT FROM MUM IN SOUTH WEST TURKEY US GETTING THAT IT WASN'T
THIS IS A MINORITY WITHIN THE ARMY IN TURKEY AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THERE IS AN ELECTED PRESIDENT IN WE ARE IN CHARGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DUTY UNTIL AT THE END WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WERE ATTACKED OVERNIGHT IN ANKARA WHERE CLASHES TOOK PLACE MILITARY JETS WERE HEARD FLYING LOW IN BOTH ANKARA AND ISTANBUL THEM ALSO SPORADIC EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE
THIS MORNING LOCAL TELEVISION HAS BEEN SHOWING PICTURES OF SOLDIERS ON THE BOSPHORUS BRIDGE IN ISTANBUL SURRENDERING THE PRESIDENT EARLIER SAID THE ACTION WAS BY A SO CALLED PARALLEL STRUCTURE A TERM HE'S USED IN THE PAST TO A FURTIVE FED TO LOOK COOL AND A CLERIC BASED IN THE U.S. WHO IS ACCUSED OF FOMENTING UNREST

A FREELANCE REPORTER IN ANKARA TO LYN DOLLAR LOU TOLD THIS PROGRAMME OF HER SHOCK THAT THE COUNTRY'S PARLIAMENT BUILDING HAD COME UNDER REPEATED ATTACK
THAT BLOWS MY MIND I REALLY CAN I GET MY HEAD AROUND THE FACT THAT THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT WHERE'S BUT NOT ONCE NOT TWICE BUT THREE TIMES LAST NIGHT THAT'S BEYOND BELIEF I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS A JOURNALIST BUT AS A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY
I CAN'T GET IT IN MY HAT TURKEY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES OF THE WEST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MAIN BACKERS OF OPPONENTS OF THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BUT CHARLES I SAID THE PRESIDENT HERDER WERNER'S ANGERED MANY IN HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF HIS AUTHORITARIAN STYLE AND HIS EFFORTS TO MAKE TURKEY LESS SECULAR A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN HAS THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE NIGHT'S EVENTS
THE ATTEMPTED COUP HAPPENED BECAUSE TURKEY IS DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER PRESIDENT HEARD ONE'S PROJECT TO TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY AND BECAUSE OF THE CONTAGION OF VIOLENCE FROM THE WAR IN SYRIA PRESIDENT MURDER ONE AND HIS A.K. PARTY HAVE BECOME EXPERTS AT WINNING ELECTIONS BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN DOUBTS ABOUT HIS LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY
HE'S AN ISLAMIST WHO'S REJECTED MODERN TURKEY'S SECULAR HERITAGE MY EVERYONE ONE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN UNASSUMING THE COUP ATTEMPT IS CHRIST MIGHT BECOME MORE SO HE'S TRYING TO TURN HIMSELF INTO A STRONG EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT
FROM THE BEGINNING THIS THIRD WHEN'S GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE WAR IN SYRIA BACKING ISLAMIST OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT ASAD BUT VIOLENCE ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE BORDER HELPING TO REIGNITE THE FIGHT WITH THE KURDISH P.K.K. AND MAKING TURKEY INTO A TARGET FOR THE JIHADISTS WHO CALL THEMSELVES ISLAMIC STATE
THAT HAS CAUSED A LOT OF DISQUIET AND TURKEY HAS FACED INCREASING TURMOIL THE ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT BE THE LAST OF IT
FRANCE'S STARTING THREE DAYS OF NATIONAL MOURNING FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE LORRY ATTACK IN NICE EIGHTY FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE CITY ON THURSDAY NIGHT TEN OF THEM WERE CHILDREN MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION IN HOSPITAL THE DEAD AND THE INJURED CAME FROM MANY COUNTRIES THE LORRY DRIVER HAS BEEN FORMALLY IDENTIFIED AS A FRENCH TUNISIAN MAN WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD BUT NO KNOWN LINKS TO ISLAMIST EXTREMISM OUR CORRESPONDENT LUCY WILLIAMSON IS IN THESE
WHAT MADE MUHAMMAD BULL ELK KILLED A FATHER OF THREE WITH A TROUBLED MARRIAGE AND A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND PETTY THEFT NEIGHBOURS DESCRIBED HIM AS STRANGE AND A LONER BUT FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAD NOT SEEN HIM AS A SECURITY RISK
THE STORIES OF HIS VICTIMS HAVE ALSO STARTED TO EMERGE SMILING OUT FROM INTIMATE FAMILY SNAPS SHAUN COPELAND FROM TEXAS WITH HIS ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON A FRENCH TOBACCONIST'S TIMOTHY WHO GAVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT HIS PREGNANT WIFE TWENTY YEAR OLD RUSSIAN STUDENT VICTORIOUS HAVE CINCO TWO PUPILS ON A SCHOOL TRIP FROM BERLIN THE LIST GROWS A LITTLE LONGER ALL THE TIME
ALONGSIDE THEIR PORTRAITS OTHER NAMELESS IMAGES OF LOSS HAVE BEGUN TO DEFINE THIS ATTACK THE PAINFUL VIGIL OF A GRIEVING RELATIVE SITTING IN THE EMPTY STREET HEAD BOWED
A CHILD'S BODY COVERED WITH A SIMPLE SHEET LIFELESS NEXT TO A DISCARDED DOLL
PRESIDENT ALARMED IS CHAIRING A MEETING OF HIS SECURITY CABINET THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE GOVERNMENT'S OPTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NICE ATTACK POLITICAL OPPONENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CRITICAL OF HIS APPROACH AS HE SCHOFIELD REPORTS FROM PARIS
FRANCE'S OPPOSITION NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL WITH ITS WORDS TOO CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT AT THIS EMOTIONAL TIME AND IT CAN BE ACCUSED OF EXPLOITING HORROR FOR POLITICAL ENDS STILL THERE'S NO MISTAKING THAT AFTER SHOW THE ABDO AND THEN THE NOVEMBER PARIS ATTACKS THIS TIME THE RIGHT FEELS IT CAN LEGITIMATELY START ASKING QUESTIONS QUICKLY ABOUT FRANCES' LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS ALLOWS YOU PAY A FRONT RUNNER FOR THE PRESIDENCY NEXT YEAR
THAT IT WAS CLEAR NOT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE TO PREVENT THE NICE ATTACK HIS RIGHT WING RIVAL THE FORMER PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY SAID THE TIME WOULD SOON BECOMING FOR ACTION NOT JUST WORDS AGAINST TERRORISM FOR THE FAR RIGHT MARINE LE PEN SAID THAT THE WAR AGAINST FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAM HAVE NOT EVEN BEGUN
PRESIDENT THE LORD WILL REPORT THAT A LOT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE LAST YEAR TO BEEF UP POLICE POWERS THE FINANCING OF INTELLIGENCE BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WITH EVERY NEW ATROCITY HIS ROLE AS SYMBOLIC PROTECTOR OF THE NATION COMES UNDER GROWING CRITICAL SCRUTINY
THREE MORE MINISTERS HAVE LEFT THE GOVERNMENT AS THERESA MAY MAKES MORE APPOINTMENTS IN THE JUNIOR RANKS OF HER FRONT BENCH TEAM ONE OF THOSE GOING THE PENSIONS MINISTER LADY OLDMAN HAS ATTACKED THE CONDUCT OF GOVERNMENT OVER THE PAST YEAR HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CAROLE WALKER
ROS ALTMANN IS A PENSIONS EXPERT HE WAS BROUGHT INTO GOVERNMENT BY DAVID CAMERON HER MINISTERIAL CAREER HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL AND SHE WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HER FORMER BOSS AT THE DEPARTMENT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IN A LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER LAST NIGHT LADY ALTMAN SAID SHORT TERM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS
EXACERBATED BY THE E.U. REFERENDUM HAS INHIBITED GOOD POLICY MAKING AND CALLED FOR MAJOR REFORMS OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING MORE HELP FOR WOMEN HIS STATE PENSION AGE HAS INCREASED AT SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL BE REPLACED BY PENNY MORDAUNT
ANOTHER OUTSPOKEN MINISTER SUE BREE SAID SHE'D RESIGNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WOULD CONTINUE TO EXPRESS HER VIEWS ON THE POSITIVE BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION AND THE YOU ED VAIZEY AN OLD FRIEND OF DAVID CAMERON'S IS ALSO OUT AS THERESA MAY PROMOTES MORE OF HER OWN CLOSE ALLIES
CAROL WALKER REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT IT LOOKS AS IF THE ATTEMPTED COUP IN TURKEY HAS FAILED BUT THIS WAS VERY SERIOUS NIGHT OF VIOLENCE WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES PLAINLY FOR TURKEY AND FOR THOSE NATIONS DEPENDING ON TURKEY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND IN THE WIDER SEARCH FOR STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST PRESIDENT ADDER ONE WAS ALREADY ACCUSED OF BEING AN INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN LEADER WHAT MIGHT HE DO NOW ASSUMING HE HAS
HE'S CLAIMING THIS MORNING REMAINED IN POWER LET'S START BY LISTENING TO SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SESSION GOING ON OF THE TURKISH PARLIAMENT LET'S JUST LISTEN IN FOR A SECOND WHICH IN THERE COME ON O.K.
MITCH THIS SULTAN CAN SOLDIER AT HORSHAM NEARLY WHACK HIM WITH A BIT OF MUM SEAN LOOK AT LUNCH WILL WRITE THIS SO M.P.S ON THEIR FEET DISCUSSING WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING DURING THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT RUNNING ELDERS FROM THE B.B.C. WORLD SERVICE IS WITH ME AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND HE'S GOING TO OUR OPPOSITION PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE CO SAYING THEY'RE STILL
BACK THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT IS NOW JUST THREE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTIES INSIDE THE PARLIAMENT THEY LEADERS CAME OUT AGAINST CONDEMNED AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS AN EMERGENCY MEETING AS YOU SAID AND PEOPLE FROM M.P.S FROM GOVERNMENT OR AN OPPOSITION SPEAK
AND THEY'RE SPEAKING IN A PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS HIT BY AIR STRIKES THREE OR FOUR TIMES AND PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THAT THERE ABSOLUTELY
STRENGTH THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY DO NOT ANY OF THEM IS THAT RIGHT SUPPORT THIS COOK YES APPARENTLY THE MEDIA COUP PLOTTERS DID NOT HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION WITH THE OPPOSITION DIDN'T KIND OF SECURE ANY SUPPORT FROM THEM EARLIER EARLIER BUT IT
YOU INCLUDING THE KURDISH PART INSIDE THE PARLIAMENT THE COACHMAN'S AWAITING A HUGE BATTLE AGAINST TURKISH SECURITY FORCES EVEN DATED THAT THEY CAME OUT AND SAID WE ARE AGAINST ANY KIND OF COUP DE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SOLD IN DEMOCRACY WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE COUP ATTEMPT AND PERHAPS ABOUT MODERN TURKEY
WELL THIS IS LIKE A KIND OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT BY SOME IN
MILITARY OFFICERS INSIDE IN NUT IN THE IRISH THERE'S A HUGE KIND OF RESENTMENT AGAINST THE HIGH COMMAND IN THE MILITARY TOO AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TURKEY IS NOW THAT TO PRESENT A DON HOLDS THE STRONG MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT
CONTROLS MOST OF THE MEDIA CONTROLS MOST OF THE JUDICIARY AND MILITARY AND THERE ARE SOME FORCES INSIDE THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO THINK THAT THIS IS KIND OF THEIR LAST MOMENT IF THEY GOT A GOING TO RESIST OUR DARNEDEST THIS IS THE MOMENT WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHETHER THESE PEOPLE ARE AND THEN THERE'S A GOOD HONEST OR NOT
BUT APPARENTLY IT TOOK TOOK HE HAD SEVERAL COUP ATTEMPT IN ITS HISTORY AND THE QUEUES ARE GENERALLY VERY UNPOPULAR EVEN ALONG PEOPLE IF IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL COOK MAYBE IT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT LIKE THEY COULD OUTDO IN TALKING ABOUT IT AS IF IT WAS IN THE PAST TENSE BUT WE ARE ALSO HEARING AREN'T WE THAT THERE IS STILL SOME FIGHTING GOING ON AND SUDDENLY THE SOUNDS OF FIGHTING AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE FATE OF THE CHIEF OF THE ARMY
IT DID BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL SORT AS I WAS SPEAKING TO WERE SAYING AT THE CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF WAS RESCUED AND HE WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE BY THE COUP PLOTTERS IN INSIDE THE MILITARY AT HEADQUARTERS AND HE WAS TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT AIR BASE AFTER A RAID INTO ED THAT AIRBASE RESULTED IN SAVING THEM BUT LAST STRONGHOLDS OF THE REBEL IN MILITARY PERSONNEL IS HOLDING OFF HE'S THE CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF
QUARTERS LATEST REPORTS ARE SAYING THAT THE POLICE'S HAVE BEEN CORDONING OFF THE AREA SECURING THE PAY EMITTER OFF THE AREA WILL BE CLEAR TO A CLEAR WAY TO BIG TO PREPARE TO GO IN TO CLEAR OFF THE LAST STRONGHOLD OF THE COUP PLOTTERS OH KAY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE LET'S TURN TO SIR DAVID LOGAN WHO IS A FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY AND IS ON THE LINE AND SOWS LAW DANITE FORMER HEAD OF THE BRITISH ARMY MORNING TO YOU BOTH SIR DAVID FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT
WELL I SUPPOSE A FAILED COUP IS BETTER THAN A SUCCESSFUL ONE BUT THIS WILL BE VERY VERY DEEP SCARS ALL NATION WHICH IS ALREADY BITTERLY DIVIDED
AS YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY IS APPALLING THE POLARISED BETWEEN EVERYONE IS ON THE ONE HAND ON THE OLD SECULAR THE SECULARISTS WHO RULED THE COUNTRY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND
MY VISION IS REFLECTED IN THE MILITARY YOU CAN SEE THAT IN PRECISELY WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE FIRST AND THIRD ARMY COMMANDER'S COMING OUT AGAINST THE AKU AKU PAUL'S NOT HAVING KEPT CONTROL OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND THE RESULT IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOT DONE IT YOUR VIEW
I AGREE WITH THAT THIS IS CLEARLY A COOT IT'S FAILED IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WELL ORGANISED BUT AS YOUR LAST REPORT HAS JUST CONFIRMED THE COUP PLOTTERS DIDN'T HAVE POLITICAL BACKING AND OF COURSE THIS ROOM ABSOLUTELY UNDERLINES THAT
OF A COUNTRY LIKE TURKEY WANTS TO HAVE A PLACE IN THE MODERN WORLD DEMOCRACY IS WHAT HAS TO RULE AND THE MILITARY HAS GOT TO UNDERSTAND QUITE CLEARLY WHAT ITS ROLE WITHIN THAT SOCIETY IS THAT IS A SERVANT OF THE DEVIL AS A DEMOCRATIC STATE AND IN THEIR WAY TRYING TO CONTROL IT SIR DAVID HOW DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT I DO WHAT I'M ASSUMING THAT HE REMAINS IN POWER NOW AND I THINK ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE THAT THAT IS THE CASE THIS MORNING HOW DO YOU THINK
WELL HE'S ALREADY PROMISED THAT THERE WILL BE A SEVERE PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN PART IN THIS AND THE CRITICAL THING FOR ALL OF US I THINK PERFECT FOR UP FOR HIS FRIENDS AND ALLIES IS THAT TURKISH DEMOCRACY SHOULDN'T BE SET BACK BY THIS BUT SHOULD BE SUSTAINED
AND OF COURSE AFTER A CREW ALL THE FORCES AT ANY RATE IN THE SHORT TERM PUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOOK
CONCERNED ABOUT AND M.P. AND ALTER HIS FRIENDS I SADIE TO WORK IT'S TRICKY TO ENSURE A BETTER OUTCOME AND THE POINT LIKE ANNA IS THIS IS AN ALLY IMPERFECT AS HE IS TO PUT IT MILDLY ON ON HIM IN MANY RESPECTS WE WE DEPEND
THAT'S RIGHT OF COURSE A TURKEY IS AN IMPORTANT NATO ALLY WHERE TURKEY SITS VISA RE THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL YES OF COURSE IT'S GOT ITS OWN INTERNAL DIVISIONS AND DIFFICULTIES EASILY THE KURDISH ASPECT OF THAT
OF THAT CONFLICT BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN WORK RELIABLY INDEPENDENTLY WITH TURKEY BECAUSE TURKEY IS AN IMPORTANT PART IN THIS FIGHT REALLY CRITICAL FIGHT TO DEFEAT ISLAMIC STATE
IN THAT FIGHT DO YOU BELIEVE LORD DAMN IT THE FACT THAT HE HAS SEEN OFF A COUP GIVES HIM AN AUTHORITY AND A STANDING THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE
WELL I THINK COMMENTATORS HAVE BEEN AGREEING THAT PRESIDENT HEROIN WAS BECOMING MORE POWERFUL MORE AUTOCRATIC CENTRALISING MORE POWER TO HIMSELF YES THIS WORLD OF COURSE ENCOURAGE HIM BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE SHOWN QUITE CLEARLY THAT HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE NOW GOT
A FAIR DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT TO BE MISSED THE FACT THAT SHE'S A GENERAL STAFF
WAS TAKEN HOSTAGE AND THAT THEREFORE THE TOP END OF THE MILITARY COMMAND CHAIN WAS WAS NEUTRALISED FOR A WHILE AND THIS PROBABLY WAS A COUP LED BY MORE JUNIOR OFFICERS
BUT THE NET RESULT OF ALL THAT IS THAT HE WILL PLACE PRESENT EVERYONE IN A MORE POWERFUL POSITION HOW HE USES THAT POWER IS NOW THE CRITICAL QUESTION FOR THE BENEFIT OF NOT ONLY HIS OWN COUNTRY BUT FOR ALL OF US WHO WERE FIGHTING AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND SIR DAVID WHEN IT COMES TO THEM THE MOTIVES OF THOSE INVOLVED WE'VE HEARD ALREADY DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME ALLEGATIONS
PRESIDENT EDDO THAT THIS SECT BASED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS BEHIND HAD A SET THAT HE WAS ONCE I WHERE THERE ISN'T ISN'T ANY MORE WHAT WHAT CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT WHAT THE POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT
OF OUTSIDERS FROM TURKEY WAS AND ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOT LIVING IN TURKEY AT THE MOMENT WAS AND WHAT THEIR IMPACT IS ON THE COUNTRY
HE WAS TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT VIRTUALLY TO THEM WHO IS A SECRETARY GENERAL CURRENTLY LIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA
OH CUE LEN WAS A CLOSE ALLY OVER AIR THE ARM UNTIL TWENTY THIRTEEN
WHEN HE MADE ACCUSATIONS ABOUT CORRUPTION IN INCOME IN THE GOVERNMENT WHICH LED TO A SPLIT
AND HIS MOVEMENT IT'S CALL HE'S MET WHICH MEANS SERVICE IN TURKEY IS A FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A MODERATE ISLAM IS FORCE
SOME PEOPLE HAVE LIKENED IT TO THE QUAKERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT BECAME EXTREMELY INFLUENTIAL IN PARTS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICE GENDARMERIE AND A MORE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL WHEN THE CONFRONTATION O.K.
HE LOST THE BATTLE BECAUSE THE PRESENT POSITION OF COURSE THE IN TURKEY AND SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO MOVE ANYONE HE SUSPECTED OF BEING A CUE LENINIST OUT OF THEIR POSTS
BUT PRESENT THAT WAS ALWAYS REGARDED AS A CONSTANT THREAT AND TALKS ABOUT TALKS ABOUT THAT IS THAT IS THAT MIRRORED AS A PARALLEL STATE IT'S ODD THOUGH THAT WE GENERALLY THINK OF OF THE ARMY IN TURKEY BEING
LOYAL TO THE IDEA OF A SECULAR ATTACK IN THAT'S WHAT THAT'S TRADITIONALLY WHY THEY'VE TAKEN POWER ISN'T IN THE PAST AND YET HERE THEY ARE APPARENTLY INFLUENCED BY A RELIGIOUS LEADER
I THINK THE OLD HORSE AND TURKEY THE DIVISION TO THE ARMED FORCES AND TURKEY EXACTLY REFLECTED DIVISIONS IN THE COUNTRY AS WELL DONE AS YOU SAY IT OPENING THERE I'VE BEEN IN THE OLD HORSES THIS IS IT THIS IS SPLIT APPARENTLY ON
WELL DIFFICULT LIZA UNDERSTAND THE TARGET IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE CREW IS LEAD GREW PLOT WAS LED BY ONE START GENERALS AND COLONELS PEOPLE AT THAT LEVEL
SO THAT I THINK THAT THAT ERA YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAS PASSED NOW PARTLY AS A RESULT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE EVERYONE CAME TO POWER IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO
I THINK YES SORRY SORRY I JUST GUESS I WANT TO PICK UP ONE POINT LORD I HOPE YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD ONE I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW TURK IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT STRATEGICALLY FOR ALL THE REASONS HE'S MENTIONED OR WHAT WHERE YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT ALL ALL OF US IN EUROPE AND
AND THEY JUST WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS A STABLE OR RELIABLE TURKEY WHICH PUT PROJECT STABILITY AND SECURITY OUTWARDS INTO THIS VERY DIFFICULT ORIGINALLY BRIDGET BRIDGET OCCUPIERS TO DO WHATEVER'S POSSIBLE FOR GOING TO BECOME PART OF THAT MORASS BUT NO DAMMIT IN THAT CASE HOW IMPORTANT IS IT NOW THAT THERE IS A DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO SAY TO PRESIDENT WON YOU SURVIVE THIS COUP BUT YOU MUST NOW
GOVAN IN A MORE DEMOCRATIC FASHION I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK WHAT
OVER HISTORY THAT THE TURKISH ARMY HAS TRIED TO DO IS RUN IT TO PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND ENSURE THAT TURKEY MOVES FORWARD UM BUT I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW GOT TO REALISE IS THAT HE HE HAS PROBABLY GATHER TOO MUCH PARTY HIMSELF HE'S BECOMING TOO AUTOCRATIC AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE WIDER DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE TO MAKE SURE HE USES THAT POWER AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER IN A SENSIBLE WAY NOT JUST FOR TURKEY BUT FOR THE WIDER REGION IT'S CRITICAL TO ALL OF US KNOW DONE AND SIR DAVID LOGAN AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH
IT'S NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT

THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINE TURKEYS PRESIDENT RICHER PATEK TYPE ER AGAIN APPEARS TO BE LARGELY BACK IN CONTROL OF HIS COUNTRY THIS MORNING AFTER AN EXTRAORDINARY NIGHT AN ATTEMPTED COUP BY PART OF THE MILITARY'S BEEN PLAYING OUT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER ELEVEN LAST NIGHT TURKISH TIME THAT MILITARY JETS WERE HEARD FLYING OVER THE CAPITAL
AND SOON AFTER THE SOUND OF THEM
TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN ISTANBUL SOLDIERS AND TANKS BLOCK TO THE TWO MAIN BRIDGES ACROSS THE BAR
TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER WENT ON TELEVISION TO SAY AN ATTEMPTED COUP WAS UNDERWAY CARRIED OUT BY PART OF THE MILITARY MIND
TANKS APPEARED ON THE STREETS SOLDIERS WENT INTO POLITICAL OFFICES AND TELEVISION STATIONS AND PROTESTERS
THE NATIONAL BROADCASTER T. ARTIE READ OUT A STATEMENT FROM THE SOLDIERS BEHIND THIS TWO SHALL DASH DEMOCRATIC IT'S LATE YOU'RE COOKING THEY SAID THE DEMOCRATIC AND SECULAR RULE OF LAW HAD BEEN ERODED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THERE TAKEN POWER TO PROTECT THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER
THEY DECLARED MARTIAL LAW IMPOSED A CURFEW AND SAID THE COUNTRY WOULD BE RUN BY A PEACE COUNCIL
PRESIDENT MURDER ONE SCRAMBLED TO RETURN FROM HIS HOLIDAY IN THE SOUTH WEST OF THE COUNTRY HIS PRESIDENTIAL PLANE CIRCLED ALONG WITH RUMOURS ABOUT WHERE HE MIGHT BE HEADING THERE WAS SOME TALK OF LONDON WHAT DID YOU PAY CASH
BUT THEN IN AN ASTONISHING BROADCAST THE PRESIDENT APPEARED VIA FACE TIME ON A MOBILE PHONE ON C.N.N.'S TURKISH CHANNEL HE SAID HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE CAPITAL TO TAKE CHARGE AND CALLED ON HIS SUPPORTERS TO GET OUT ON THE STREETS SAYING I URGE THE TURKISH PEOPLE TO GATHER PUBLIC SQUARES AND AIRPORTS THERE IS NO POWER HIGHER THAN THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW
EXCELLENT
IN THE CAPITAL ANKARA OR HELICOPTER OPEN FIRE ON THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING AND EXPLOSIONS WERE HEARD IT WAS SHOT DOWN BY AN ARMY JET THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF THE MILITARY FIGHTING ITSELF IN ISTANBUL PROTESTERS FACED DOWN THE TANKS ON THE STREET
AND THEN THE TIDE SEEMED TO TURN BUT ISTANBUL AIRPORT DESPITE THE TANKS OUTSIDE
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT MASSED IN THE DEPARTURE
PRESIDENT LANDED HE HAD APPEARED TO BE BACK IN CONTRAST WITH THE BINS
WHAT IS BEEN PERPETRATED IS A TREASON AND REBELLION THEY WILL PAY A HEAVY PRICE FOR THIS ACT OF TREASON TURKEY AS A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT IT WILL END WELL
AND IN THE LAST HOUR WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN ARRESTED NINETY ARE DEAD FROM THE FIGHTING OVERNIGHT MORE THAN A THOUSAND WOUNDED PARLIAMENT A MEETING IN AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE IN THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE BOMBED THREE OR FOUR TIMES OVERNIGHT RATHER SICK OF HAJI KHAN IS AN M.P. AND ON THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF PRESIDENT EDWARD'S PARTY I ASKED HER WHO IS IN CONTROL IN TURKEY AT THE MOMENT
RIGHT NOW IT'S THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AND TURKISH SECURITY FOR UNFORTUNATE THEY YESTERDAY WE WERE ALL
UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THEIR TAM
BY A FRACTION IN THE MILITARY TO DO AIR COOL EVERYTHING IS NOW IN OR DIRT AND THE TURKISH POLLY
AND OTHER MILITARY A FEW SHELLS THAT WERE NOT A PART OF THAT FRACTION HAVE TAKEN OVER NOW NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS STILL FIGHTING AND WEAR THERE WHERE THOSE WHO WOULD THE GOVERNMENT ARE STILL DESTABILISING SITUATION POSSIBLY IN CONTROL CAN YOU SAY THAT IT IS OVER I CAN SEE THAT IT IS ALMOST IT'S VERY CLOSE TO EAT OVER I AM I WAS IN ISTANBUL LAST NIGHT
WE WERE OUT ON THE STREETS WITH THEIR PEOPLE WHIPPED THE CITIZENS OF THIS STAMP ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALTERED OR DIFFERENT PARTIES WE WERE ALL TOGETHER THERE A BOSS FOR A SPRAY WHY WAS FIELD THE WAY IT SAM
MILITARY PARIS THAT'S BELONG TO THAT SACK SHUN AND THIS MORNING THEY WERE ALL SAW YOU STABILISED AND NO
THERE IS JUST A COUPLE OF LUCKY DEAD STILL OPERATIONS OUTGOING BUT OVERALL WE CAN SAY THAT IT'S NINETY FIVE PER CENT EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHO WAS BEHIND THIS COUP
WHAT WE ARE TOLD BY OFFICIALS AND BUY
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WE GET FROM THERE FROM THE STATEMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTERS HIS STATS
GOOD MAN MOVEMENTS WHAT WE CALLED THE PERILS STATE OR WHAT YOU CAN EXPLAIN AS MAYBE EACH SHIFT CALL MUM DAD TRY TO TAKE OFF THE GOVERNMENT
LAST YEAR AS WELL WITH YOUR DIFFERENT OPERATION
REALLY DID YOU DUMP THE GENERALS GENERAL BELIEF IS THAT THEY ARE BEHIND THIS YES FOR FOR TOOLA GO LEN SAYS THAT HE WASN'T BEHIND IT HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS I DO NOT EXPECT HIM TO CHEER
EXCEPT DEATH BUT I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THERE IN THE COMING DAYS WE WILL LEARN MORE OR AIRS AS THINGS SETTLE DOWN NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE PRESIDENT PRESIDENT HAD ONE HAD BEEN CRITICISED FOR BEING
INCREASINGLY AUTHORITARIAN AND FOR CRACKING DOWN ON JOURNALISTS AND ON FREE SPEECH IN TURKEY WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN NOW DOORS CRITICISM THAT R. ONE
I JUST AREN'T THEY HOW MUCH WE HAVE NO
WHAT WE NEED TO RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY ONTO STREETS WHAT WE SAW IN THE TURKISH GRAND NATIONS MUST STAMP THE YESTERDAY I WASN'T THERE BUT MY FRIENDS WERE THERE BECAUSE I HAD TO BE IN ISTANBUL ED MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE WORD CLOSE TIME KARA WHERE IN THE PARLIAMENT
WHILE IT'S GUTS BARNS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THERE IN THERE IN THERE A LONG TIME THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND A QUIET
GOT TOGETHER IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THE NATION A LIST PARTY ALSO JOIN THEM IAN HEIRS STATES IN STATING
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ONE AGAINST TURKISH DEMOCRACY IS SO I THINK AFTER THIS THERE WILL BE MORE SOLIDARITY AND
THERE IS GOING TO BE A TRIAL PERIOD ANTWERP WHERE DID THIS WILL GET THEIR PUNISHMENT RAV CIRCA BADJAY KHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE JUST HAD IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A NEW FOREIGN SECRETARY BORIS JOHNSON HE'S SPOKEN TO HIS COUNTERPART IN TURKEY AND UNDERLINED HE SAYS THE U.K.'S SUPPORT FOR THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BOWEN IS ON ON THE LINE NOW AND AND JEREMY OF COURSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD'VE LIKED PRESIDENT WENT TO GO BUT WHAT'S CLEAR IS NOT LIKE THIS
I THINK THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY OPPOSED IN THE COUNTRY AND THEY TEND TO BE SECULAR THEY TEND TO BE URBANISED THOSE KINDS OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT A MILITARY COUP BECAUSE THEY SEE THE MILITARY IS RETROGRADE RIGHT RIGHT WING FORCE SO AT THE MOMENT IT IS IT ISN'T CLEAR JUST EXACTLY
WHY THE WHO WAS BEHIND IT AND WHETHER THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE GULA NESTS WERE IS ACTUALLY THE CASE OR WEATHER ONCE AGAIN THE ODOUR WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING IT AS A BIT OF AN EXCUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT THE THE SECULAR HERITAGE WHICH THE ARMY TRADITION IS SEEN IT'S A SEED ITSELF AS THE DEFENDER OF
HAS BEEN VERY MUCH UNDER ATTACK AND HE'S TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF COUNTRY AND AN ISLAMIST COUNTRY AND CO IT'S A COUNTRY IN WHICH ABOUT
HALF OF TURKS FEEL LEFT OUT SO IT'S VERY VERY DIVIDED BUT OF COURSE ON HIS SIDE HE INSPIRES A LOT OF DEVOTION AND HE SAW THAT PEOPLE GO OUT TO THE STREET AND HEAR WHAT SEEMS LIKELY IS THAT HIS AUTHORITY WILL BE ENHANCED BY THIS I SUPPOSE THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW HE WILL USE THAT
WELL HIS OBJECTIVE LONGER TERM IS TO TRY TO GET AN EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY HE WANTS TO BE AS PRESIDENT HE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION HE COULDN'T BE PRIME MINISTER ANY MORE SO HE'S PRESIDENT THE PRESIDENT IS MEANT TO BE A FIGUREHEAD IN TURKEY BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE UNDER MY HERD ARE ONE
AND HE WANTS TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION SO THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE LEGALLY AN EXECUTIVE PRESENT HE'S A DE FACTO EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT
AND THE THING ABOUT TURKEY AT THE MOMENT IS THAT IT'S REALLY DEEPLY DEEPLY DIVIDED AND IT HAS A HISTORY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN WELL WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AT THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FEARING
THAT THE POLITICAL DIVISIONS COULD TURN INTO THE USE OF FORCE IN SOME WAY AND THERE'S THE OTHER FACTOR THAT'S HER WORK AND THAT IS THE CONTAGION OF VIOLENCE THAT COMES OUT OF SYRIA
JEREMY BYRNE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS JUST COMING UP TO QUARTERS AND I'LL LET'S HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE SECOND EDITIONS OF SOME OF THEM INCLUDE EARLY DETAILS OF THAT ATTEMPTED MILITARY CO OVERNIGHT AND TURKEY MOST THEY'RE LEADING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THE BASTILLE DAY ATTACK IN NICE THE FINANCIAL TIMES DESCRIBING FRANCE AS A NATION TRAUMATISED IT'S AS STRESSED AS THE COUNTRY WAS EXHALING AT A SECURITY THREAT SEEMINGLY AVOIDED
IT FOUND ITSELF IN AN AGONISINGLY FAMILIAR POSITION REELING FROM A TERROR ATTACK IN AN UNEXPECTED LOCATION THE INDEPENDENT SAYS AN ENTIRE CONTINENT HAS BEEN LEFT AT ITS WITS' END BY A THIRD ATROCITY IN FRANCE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS WHILE THE SUN HEADLINE ASK WHY MOORLAND IN THE TIMES AS ONE OF SEVERAL CARTOONIST TO USE THE RED WHITE AND BLUE OF THE FRENCH FLAG HE MAKES THEM A TRIO OF FIREWORKS A REFERENCE TO THE DISPLAY THE VICTIMS ARE JUST WATCHED WITH THE RED BURST OF LIGHT DRIPPING BLOOD

THE DAILY MAIL DESCRIBED THE POLITICAL CHANGES SINCE THE E.U. REFERENDUM AS A VERY BRITISH PEACEFUL REVOLUTION RICHARD SAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE AS WHAT'S A CUP WHAT ARE CALLED UNDEMOCRATIC HE KNEW THE DAILY EXPRESS USES ITS LEADER COLUMN TO URGE THE NEW PRIME MINISTER TO TRICKLE UP TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AND GET ON WITH BRECHT'S IT IT SAYS ANY DISAGREEMENTS OVER FUTURE TRADE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE RESOLVED IN THE TWO YEARS TIME FRAME ALLOWED

RIGHT ACROSS THAT'S STRAIGHT ACROSS TAXI
IT'S STILL IT'S STILL WITHIN VISUAL DISTANCE SO HE'S JETS ARE FLYING VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND
THE B. B. IS KATIE WATSON IS IN ISTANBUL AND KATIE WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN THE CITY THIS MORNING
RELATIVE CALM THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW COMING OUT ONTO THE STREETS SHOPS OPENING THERE ARE TAXIS RUNNING WHEN I GOT UP MUCH EARLIER IT WAS PRACTICALLY PRACTICALLY DESERTED SO THINGS PERHAPS AT A GETTING BACK TO NORMAL BUT IT'S STILL A VERY FLUID SITUATION WE'VE HEARD THAT ONE AND A HALF
THOUSAND PERSONNEL MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN DETAINED THERE FIGURE THE DEATH TOLL HAS GONE UP TO NINETY WITH A THOUSAND WOUNDED SO AT THE MOMENT THE SITUATION THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL BUT THERE WILL BE A PARLIAMENTARY MEETING LATER AND ANKLE WILL GET A BIT MORE DETAIL LATER IN THE DAY AND OF COURSE WE WERE HEARING ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING ITSELF WAS BEING ATTACKED LAST NIGHT IN ANKARA
ABSOLUTELY IN THE PICTURES THAT ARE COMING OUT TODAY JUST SHOW COMPLETE DEVASTATION PEOPLE WALKING AROUND AND JUST SHOWING HOW THE PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN HIT CERTAINLY ANKARA
BEING THE CAPITAL GOT THE BRUNT OF IT HERE IN ISTANBUL WE JUST HEARD THERE THE JETS FLYING OVERHEAD WE WE HEARD THE SOUND THAT THE BOOM AS THEY WENT THROUGH IT IT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION BUT THEN THERE'LL BE A PLANE GOING THROUGH SO YOU KNEW IT WAS A PLAY NOT AN EXPLOSION BUT WITH THERE WAS SPORADIC GUNFIRE AS WELL NONE OF THAT THIS MORNING IT'S VERY IT'S MUCH CALMER AS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY SAY THEY'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL BUT AT THE MOMENT IT'S STILL PRETTY UNCLEAR SITUATION EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
AND PERHAPS FOR HOW LONG WILL GET MUCH MORE DETAIL HOPEFULLY LATER IN THE DAY AND KATIE OF COURSE WELL DONE THE FIRST SIGNS OF THIS WAS HAPPENING LAST NIGHT WAS WHEN THE TWO BRIDGES MAIN BRIDGES ACROSS THE BOSPHORUS IN THE CENTRE OF ISTANBUL WERE OCCUPIED BY SOLDIERS AND TANKS BUT WE'VE SEEN THESE SCENES ON LINE OF PEOPLE FACING UP TO THAT
ABSOLUTELY WE HEARD THERE WERE TANKS ON THE STREET THERE WERE SOLDIERS ON THE BRIDGES AND THEY WERE CLOSE THAT WAS THE FIRST WE HEARD OF IT AND IN A CITY THAT'S JUST RECENTLY HAD AN ATTACK ON ITS AIRPORT THERE WERE A LOT OF KIND OF QUESTION MARKS EXACTLY WHAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON
BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE OF COURSE WHO WERE THE WORK THERE WAS A CURFEW IMPOSED PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO GO HOME BUT THERE WAS SAYING ACTUALLY GO ON TO THE STREETS WE NEED TO PROTEST THIS TAKE OVER AND HE'S GOT A BIG SUPPORT BASE THOSE PEOPLE DID COME OUT AND THAT OF THE FACE OFF WE SAW AND WITH MORE VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES IN ANKARA BUT SUDDEN HERE AND IN ISTANBUL TO THERE WERE THOSE THOSE CONFRONTATIONS KATIE WATSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS FIVE TO NINE LET'S TURN FINALLY TO I LOVE SCOTT WHO IS A WRITER OF BRITISH AND TURKISH NOTHING NATIONALITY AUTHOR OF TURKISH AWAKENING JOINS US FROM ISTANBUL AND OUR B.B.C. WORLD SERVICE CORRESPONDENT CANADIAN VINCE IS STILL WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO I'LL HAVE SCOTT FIRST OF ALL WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPACT OF LAST NIGHT HE'S GOING TO BE ON TURKEY
WELL IT WAS A PRETTY TENSE SITUATION AS YOU WERE SAYING AFTER THE BOMBINGS AFTER THEIR MANY PROBLEMS THIS YEAR ANYWAY AND IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE SO NOW HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS A GENERAL SENSE OF RELIEF THAT GOOD IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T QUITE TAKE HOLD LAST NIGHT
THERE'S A SORT OF STUNNED STUNNED QUIET TODAY BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN COULD BE MUCH WORSE AND WE'RE READING ABOUT HORRIBLE SCENES VIOLENCE AND SO ON BUT IT'S SO
I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SENSE THAT EVEN THOSE YOU DIDN'T SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ARE A KIND OF RELIEVED TO TELL YOU HAS A VERY HORRIBLE HISTORY OF MILITARY COUPS AND ARRAN IT'S JUST MANY PEOPLE SERIOUS IT'S NOT THE WAY FORWARD
OLD IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW DO YOU THINK TO THE PLOTTERS AND THERE'D BEEN A LOT OF ARREST FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR MORE EXACTLY MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF OFFICERS WARY COLONEL SO IT'S SOMEHOW CLEARED OUT THIS IS A KIND OF A COLONEL LEVEL
DOUBLE COOK BOTH AGAINST MILITARY ALSO AGAINST THIS PRESIDENT HIMSELF BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER PRESENT OUT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO THROW TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER IN SUCH INTERVENTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HE MANAGED TO CONSULT IT CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER BY TAKING CONTROL OF
A TURKISH INTELLIGENCE MOST OF THE MEDIA JUDICIARY AND HAVING A STRONG WITH A MAJORITY IN THE PARLIAMENT BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH FOOD HE CAN GO AND A FEW MONTHS AGO IT WAS KIND OF FELT THAT I DON'T HAVE THE LAST SAY IN THE COUNTRY HAD A HUGE CONTROL THE COUNTRY THIS INCIDENT APPARENTLY SHOWS THAT HE CANNOT COULDN'T CONTROL SOME PARTS OF THE MILITARY HAD I LOVE SCOTT DOES THIS WE'VE BEEN HERE DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME HOW DIVIDED
TURKEY IS THAT DOES THIS IN ANY SENSE BRING IT TOGETHER INASMUCH AS THERE'S QUITE A FEW OPPONENTS HAVE PRESIDENT HEARD ONE ONE NONETHELESS IN SPITE OF BEING OPPOSED TO HIM AND THINKING THAT HE'S BEEN IN MANY WAYS ABOUT PRESIDENT ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO IT DON'T WANT TO SEEM OVER THROWN IN THIS WAY
WELL I THINK IN THIS WAY IS THE CRUCIAL PHRASE I THINK THEY WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE WERE TO DEMOCRATIC MEANS BEING OVERTHROWN WITH THEIR DEMOCRATIC ELECTION SUCH AS THAT IS POSSIBLE BUT BUT YEAH IT'S CERTAINLY A SENSE THAT A BLOODY QUEUE WAS ON THE HORIZON I MEAN THAT WASN'T WELCOME TUBE TO MOST PARTS I THINK IN THE LONG TERM THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR TURKEY IN THE SENSE THAT THE KEEN BEING OVERTHROWN
WILL BE GOOD FOR TURKEY BUT IT JUST REALLY DRUMS TO DO THE FLOOR
ALMOST ALL THE DIFFERENCES AMONG AMONG TAXI INCH REALLY CHILL EXTREMELY DIFFERENTLY TOWARDS ADULTS PUT IT MILDLY AND WHAT WAS VERY STRIKING ABOUT THE SCENES LAST NIGHT WHAT ARE PEOPLE HE CAME OUT TO THE STREET SUITS YOU DESTROYED THE SOLDIERS TO DEFY RICKY WET WERE ALL PASSIONATE SUPPORTERS OF OUR DOGS AND IN FACT HE DIDN'T SEE PEOPLE COMING OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE ARMY AT ALL REALLY
AND THAT WAS QUITE STRIKING JUST AT THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT HE HAD THAT PLAY VERY WELL GOOD HOW SUSCEPTIBLE WILL HE BE NOW TO PRESSURE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD TO SAY BE MODERATE IN YOUR RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS AND IN THE LONGER TERM BE MORE DEMOCRATIC AS WELL BILLY TAKE NOTICE
I THINK THIS CLEARLY LEAVES TURKISH MILITARY IN A WEAKER POSITION WHICH ALSO WE COULD WE CAN ADD ONS HANDING IN TERMS OF ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE FELT THE NEED TO MEND RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA IT'S IN ISRAEL AND ALSO INCREASING WITH CEREAL BECAUSE IT NO LONGER HAS A HIGH HIGHLY MORAL STRONG MILITARY FIGHTING AGAINST THE KURDISH MILITANTS FOR EXAMPLE AND IN THE SOUTH EAST
BUT HE WILL HE KIND OF CONSOLIDATED HIS ON BASE BY SHOWING THAT THE THREATS HE'S ALWAYS BEEN TALKING ABOUT LIKE IT CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IS SOMEHOW HAS SOME GROUND IN AGONY ELDERS AND HAVE SCOTT AS WELL ON THE LINE FROM ISTANBUL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH OUR EDITORS WERE TIM DEFY MANDAN LUCINDA DAY FROM US ALL HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND
