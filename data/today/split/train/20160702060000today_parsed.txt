THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN CARTOON IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY SAYS SO HAS GOT TWO STUDENTS OUTSIDE UNIVERSITY ONCE SAYING TO THE OTHER I'M STUDYING POLITICS THE COURSE COVERS THE PERIOD FROM EIGHT A.M. ON THURSDAY TO LUNCHTIME ON FRIDAY LETTERS WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MIND TURNED TO CHRIS MASON OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT COUPLE THINGS TALK ABOUT CHRIS I SUPPOSE THE FIRST IS ANDREA LET'S RISE UP THE POLES OF THE POLES THAT IS OF CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AND THE SECOND IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LABOUR WHICH WE HAD A BIT ABOUT ME IN THERE
BULLETIN SHALL WE DEAL WITH ANGELA LED SOME FIRST OF ALL AND THERESA MAY WHAT THAT THE LATEST IT YEAH NO SHORTAGES YOU SAY OF QUESTIONS IN POLITICS RIGHT NOW I THINK YOU HAD TWO OR THREE THERE THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE OTHERS AND AS THE MUTT CARTOON HINTED AT IT AFTER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS RULING ANYTHING OUT SEEMS MAD IN POLITICS AT THE MOMENT ON ANGIE ALLOWED SOME AND THE CONSERVATIVES EFFECTIVELY THERE THERE'S THE DIVIDE WITHIN
THE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE IS BETWEEN THOSE WHO WERE REMAIN AND THOSE WHO WOULD LEAVE IN THE REFERENDUM AND THEN THERE'S THE DIVIDE OF WHAT M.P.S THINK OF MICHAEL GOES BEHAVIOUR THE OTHER DAY AND THERE IS SPITTING ANGER FROM SOME THAT IS LEADING SOME ON THE OUTER SIDE THE BRACTS SETTEE ASIDE TO GIVE ANDREA LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN DUNCAN SMITH THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER
SAYING THAT HE IS BACKING HEARD NOW AS THINGS STAND SHE APPEARS WELL BEHIND IN THE TALLY OF M.P.S THAT SHE HAS TO HER NAME THERE'S SOME EXPECTATION THERE MIGHT BE A FEW MORE RALLYING TO HER CAUSE IN THE COMING DAYS FIRST ROUND OF VOTING COMING UP ON TUESDAY AND IS IT POSSIBLE
DON'T BE TOO WELL YOU CAN'T BE TOO MACHIAVELLIAN KENNY ACTUALLY NOT BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUN THERESA MAY SUPPORTERS MIGHT GO FOR ANGELA LETS IT AND TRY AND GET HER IN TO MAKE SURE THE GAME ISN'T THERE AND THEN SWAP THEIR VOTES ME OUT I THINK THE PHRASE ANYTHING IMPOSTOR IS POSSIBLE IN POLITICS IS WERE SAYING HOOVER GAVE AS WE GO ENTIRELY POSSIBLE ARE YOU SPEAKING TO CONSERVATIVE M.P.S OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THERE WAS A SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT
AS A RESULT OF PRETTY MUCH EVERY ITEM OF NEWS OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS AND PARTICULARLY THAT NEWS AROUND BORIS JOHNSON SO THINGS REMAIN VERY VERY FLUID AND WHILST THE TIMESCALE WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR DIARY SEEMS QUITE SHORT TERM WITH THAT FIRST ROUND OF VOTING ON TUESDAY NEXT ROUND ON THURSDAY THE ONE AFTER THAT THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY GIVEN HOW FLUID THINGS ARE THINGS COULD STILL CHANGE VERY QUICKLY AND LABOUR'S PLAN IS THAT SOME OF THE M.P.S PLAN IS THAT THEY SAID TO JEREMY CALLED AND ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPENED WHICH IS NOT WITH YOU
YEAH THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHERE WE ARE WITH LABOUR THIS MORNING IS THAT THERE WAS AN ATTEMPTS THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK FROM LOTS OF M.P.S AT WESTMINSTER TO EFFECTIVELY FORCED JEREMY CORBETT OUT BY MAKING IT COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL FOR HIM TO CONTINUE THE VERY BUSINESS OF BEING A LEADER WHAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED THAT BIT'S THE IMPRACTICAL BIT WITH SIXTY ODD VACANCIES ON HIS OWN FRONT BENCH FOR INSTANCE THIS MORNING IN VARIOUS VARIOUS MEMBERS WHO ARE WILLING TO SIT ON THAT FRONT BENCH HAVING TO DO MULTIPLE JOBS
SHADOW SCOTTISH AND NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY IS THE SAME BLOKE AND HE IS ENGLISH AND GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE THAT THE DIFFICULTY THEY ARE ARRANGE SO BUT THEY'VE CREATED THAT'S IN PRACTICALITY FOR HIM WITHOUT ACTUALLY SHIFTING HIM SO HE IS STILL THERE THE LATEST AS AS WE REPORTED IN THE BULLETIN THE SUGGESTION FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THE SHADOW CABINET BUT PERHAPS HE CAN
HE CAN GO BUT HIS LEGACY CAN BE PRESERVED THE LEGACY OF THE LEFT CAN BE PRESERVED THE DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT CAN BE PRESERVED BUT THE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WITH A MEETING WITH JEREMY CORBIN CAME TO NOTHING COS HE SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT TO MEET THEM I DRESSED CONVINCED THAT THE THE OUTCOME FOR HIM WAS THE SIDE THEY WERE GONNA TRY AND SHUT THE DOOR CHRIS THANKS WERE FROM A MOMENTUM TO TWENTY PAST
IT IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN THEIR COUNTRY HAVE GIVEN POLITICIANS CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS SO WHAT ARE MORE THAN A THIRD OF VOTERS BELIEVED THAT BRITAIN MAY END UP STAYING IN THE E.U. AS THE FINDING OF A POLL FOR NEWSNIGHT CARRIED OUT BY ITS MAURIE I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO TIM FARRON THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER WHO'S PROMISED THAT HIS PARTY'S NEXT MANIFESTO WILL INCLUDE A PROMISE TO RETURN TO YOU LATER THIS MORNING HE'LL BE SPEAKING AT A MARCH FOR EUROPE IN LONDON I SPOKE TO HIM FROM HIS HOME IN CUMBRIA BEFORE HE SET OFF
ON THE ONE HAND I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT FOR ME TO BE UTTERLY GRACIOUS ABOUT THE RESULT UTTERLY RESPECT IT AND BE A GOOD LOSER BUT SECONDLY IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR BALOO
AND ARE YOUR VALUES AND YOU DON'T GIVE UP THAT'S HOW IT IS AND ELECTIONS YOU GRACIOUSLY ACCEPT DEFEAT IN THIS COUNTRY BUT SURELY YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE UP WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN SO I THINK YOU STILL RIGHT FOR BRITAIN TO BE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT I THINK STAND THE MANDATE IS FOR THE BRITISH GOING TO TAKE US OUT AND YOUR WORDS AT THIS POINT AND YOU DON'T GIVE UP SO WHAT WHAT POINT MIGHT IT BE LEGITIMATE DEMOCRATICALLY TO SAY DESPITE THE FACT SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE VOTED TO GET OUT WE STILL THINK THE COUNTRY COULD STAY IT
SO I GUESS THE THERE'S NO POINT WHATSOEVER I THINK THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING FOR AN EARLY SECOND SECOND REFERENDUM I RESPECT WHAT THEY SAY I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT'LL BE STICKING TWO FINGERS UP AT THE ELECTRIC AND THAT WILL BE UTTERLY UTTERLY WRONG I ALSO VERY VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THOSE M.P.S WHO SAY THAT
PARLIAMENT COS SOMEHOW SCOTCH THE REFERENDUM AND OVERTURN IT THAT WOULD BE MASSIVELY ANTI DEMOCRATIC AND WRONG SO HAD NEED TO BE SOME KIND OF ADDITIONAL MANDATE OR A REPEAL OR SOME KIND OF
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE ELECTORATE IN THE MOST LIKELY WAY AT THAT HAPPENING IS TO A GENERAL ELECTION AND IF YOU THINK IF THE PUBLIC WERE TO VOTE FOR PARTIES LIKE YOUR OWN NOW YOU'RE SAYING THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WOULD BE EXPLICITLY COMMITTED TO RETURN TO THE BUT IF THEY VOTED FOR YOU THEY VOTED FOR OTHER PARTIES YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER BIG PARTY LIKE SAY THE LABOUR PARTY IN THE SAME THING WOULD YOU NOT THEN THAT MIGHT OVERTURN THE DEMOCRATIC MANDATE OF THE REFEREE
IT MIGHT CHANGE THE INSTRUCTIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE ELECTRIC I THINK THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM THE REFERENDUM RESULT IS WHAT THE MAJORITY ARE AGAINST WHAT IS NOT CLEAR IS WHAT THEY ARE FOR AND A GOVERNMENT A NEW PRIME MINISTER WILL HAVE TO GO TO BRUSSELS AND NEGOTIATE A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND THE POINT IS THAT SURELY AT SOME STAGE WE'RE JUST SPECULATING AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THE PRIME MINISTER WILL NEED NEW INSTRUCTIONS SHALL WE SAY FROM THE ELECTORATE
AS TO WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE THAT MIGHT COME THROUGH A REFERENDUM IN ANOTHER PARLIAMENT WHERE PEOPLE ACCEPT THE NEW DEAL WITH EUROPE ECONOMIC EUROPEAN BE ECONOMIC AREA OR COMPLETE REMOVAL FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE AT THAT POINT PEOPLE WOULD BE ALSO
A BALLET WHETHER THEY WANTED TO RETAIN MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE LET'S REMEMBER WHEN WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY WE HAVE NOT LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE ARE WITHIN OUR RIGHTS TO REVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY ANY TIME WE TUNE IT'S NOT UP TO TWENTY SEVEN
MEMBERS TO SAY NOPE SORRY EVEN WROTE ARTICLE FIFTY YOU'VE NOW GOT TO GO THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WRITER REMAIN THAT ARTICLE FIFTY ANOTHER OTHER WORDS LIKE FILING THE LETTER FOR DIVORCE IN EFFECT PEOPLE HAVE TENDED TO THINK HIS IS THE MOMENT IT'S ALL OVER BUT YES THERE'S ANOTHER TWO YEARS TO NEGOTIATE THE TERMS BUT EFFECTIVELY ONCE YOU FILED IT YOU REALLY REALLY ARE ON THE WAY OUT YOU SEEM TO BE SUGGESTING EVEN THAT IS NOT THE MOMENT IT'S OVER
NO I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE ON THE ON THE LEAVES SIDE OF THE DEBATE THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS PEOPLE WHO WANT US TO COMPLETELY ISOLATE THE CARDINALS FROM EUROPE
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE NO FREEDOM ON THE WOOD WHATSOEVER SO THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE BRAKES IT SIDES AND IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR THE GOVERNMENT
TO JUST ASSUME WHICH PARTICULAR FLAVOUR OF GREG'S IT THEY CHOOSE TO ADOPT THAT'S ONE OF THE WRINKLE THERE ONE OF THE WRINKLE WHICH IS IT SUGGESTED THAT ONLY PARLIAMENT CAN ACTUALLY FILE THIS ARTICLE FIFTY FILE FOR DIVORCE THAT A PRIME MINISTER ON THEIR OWN DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DO IT NOW
COULD EITHER REFUSE OR OF COURSE SET CONDITIONS TO THE PRIME MINISTER WILL ONLY WILLING TO DO THAT WHEN WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT A B. OR C. DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A LEGITIMATE ROLE FOR M.P.S AND PEERS
SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT M.P.S DO NOT WHATEVER THEY THINK ABOUT THE OUTCOME THE REFERENDUM DO NOT THWART THE WILL OF THE PUBLIC AS THINGS ARE AT THE MOMENT BUT THE TECHNICALITY AS TO WHETHER IT'S THE PRIME MINISTER'S CHOICE OR PARLANCE SURELY ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE GIVING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PRIME MINISTER TO WORK OUT WHAT THE TERNS OF A NEGOTIATION A NEW PRIME MINISTER
NEED A NEGOTIATING MAP DATE AND WE OUGHT TO BE MAKING SURE THAT THAT PERSON HAS THAT MONDAY AND THEY DON'T JUST GO AND WIND AND IT'S RIGHT FOR ME I THINK TO EXPRESS A POINT OF VIEW I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE IS SERIOUSLY EXPRESSING WHICH IS LIT STILL RIGHT ARGUE FOR BRITAIN AT THE HEART
OF EUROPE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME AND MANY OF THE SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WILL AGREE THAT IT'S RIGHT THAT WE HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION EVEN IF WE'RE NOT A MEMBER OF
TIM FARRON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I'LL BE EXPLORING THAT INTERESTING LEGAL QUESTION ABOUT THE INVOCATION OF ARTICLE FIFTY AND INDEED WHETHER OR NOT IT IS TRUE THAT YOU CAN
REVOKE IT AS WELL HAVING INVOKED IT APT ONE BOUT HALF AN HOUR'S TIME TURN UP TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LATEST IN AN OCCASIONAL SERIES ON THE TOWNS AND THE CITIES COMPETING TO BE THE U.K. CITY OF CULTURE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CHOSEN CITY'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED DURING HULLS YEAH HULL'S YEAH A CITY OF CULTURE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NICK HYAM HAS BEEN VISITING ALL THE BIDDERS AND MOST RECENTLY HE HAS BEEN IN STOKE ON TRENT STOKE'S FAMOUS FOR ITS POTTERIES OF COURSE WHAT ELSE WOULD IT HAVE TO OFFER

I THINK THIS KIND OF INCREDIBLE IN ITS OWN WAY A BLUNDER WHAT IS PLUNGING
IT'S A MIXING BOWL SO IT'S BASICALLY WHERE WE MIX THE SOLID CLAY WITH WATER TO MAKE THE SLIP WHICH IS THE LIQUID WE USED TO COME
STEVEN MOORE IS CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF CERAMICS FIRM BURLY WHOSE HOME MADE WHERE'S NOW CATER TO A LUXURY MARKET THE SIX TOWNS THAT MAKE UP STOKE WERE KNOWN AS THE POTTERIES MAKING CERAMICS A FUSION OF ART AND TECHNOLOGY IS CENTRAL TO THE CITY'S IDENTITY

JANE SIMPSON MAKES SCULPTURES THAT LOOK LIKE STUFFED ANIMALS SHE SAYS BECOMING CITY OF CULTURE WOULD GIVE MORE ARTISTS LIKE HER THE REASON TO STAY
I THINK IT GIVES A GREAT BOOST WE CAN PROMOTE IN SAY LIKE FROM THE CITY OF CULTURE IF PEOPLE ARE COMING IN THIS MORE POTENTIAL FUNDING MORE POTENTIAL FOR RECOGNITION
SUCH A GREAT THING FOR ALL THE CREATIVE
WHY I'M HERE IT'S NOT MUCH FUN THERE'S PLENTY OF CULTURE IN STOKE HOOD ISN'T POPPED BAND AT THE NEW VIC THEATRE THEY WERE REVIVING VICTORIA WOOD'S FIRST PLAY TALENT FIONA WALLIS IS THE THEATRE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

CITY OF CULTURE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE
A YOUTH DANCE GROUP REHEARSE AT THE VICTORIA HALL IN THE CITY CENTRE THIS IS STOKES CULTURAL QUARTER FULL OF POP UP BUSINESSES RUN BY AND FOR ARTISTS BUT THEY CAN AFFORD THE RENTS BECAUSE SO MANY COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE MOVED OUT

TO CAR THIRTEEN HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN RESCUED SEVEN ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR AT LEAST FIVE OF THE HOSTAGE TAKERS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY BANGLADESHI COMMANDOS THE KATHY WAS TARGETED BY FORCES OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IT'S IN THE DIPLOMATIC QUARTER IT'S POPULAR WITH FOREIGNERS AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT UP TO TWENTY FOREIGNERS WERE BEING HELD CAPTIVE INCLUDING PEOPLE FROM JAPAN AND ITALY WERE SHEILA OR HIM LIVES NEXT DOOR TO IT
EAT IN IT DOYLE STARTED GUNSHOTS BANK SOUNDS BUT IT WAS HIS LEG WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE AND GUNSHOTS FROM ALL AROUND
FROM MY LAWYER BILLING WILL STOP FROM THE FRONT BILLING WILL STOP AND I GOT ALL I GOT I JUST HEARD ONE I THINK THAT WAS A BOMB
I'M A GIBBERING HE'S HERE WITH ME NOW DO YOU LET'S BEGIN LET'S GO BACK A STAGE IT'S REALLY QUITE UNUSUAL IS IT NOT FOR FOREIGNERS TO BEEN TARGETED IN BANGLADESH THIS IS A SHOCKING EVENT IN ITS OWN RIGHT
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE'VE SEEN AN ESCALATION IN VIOLENCE IN BANGLADESH THROUGH THE LAST YEAR REALLY WITH INCREASINGLY TARGETED KILLINGS AND SOME SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN BLAMED ON ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS POSSIBLY SOME LINK TO THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THERE WAS HARD PROOF THAT OF COURSE BUT THOSE HAVE TENDED TO FOCUS ON INDIVIDUALS RELIGIOUS MINORITIES HINDU PRIESTS FOR EXAMPLE A SECULAR WRITERS
PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE CAUSING OFFENCE IN SOME WAY TO THE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUP NEVER ANYTHING LIKE THIS A SIEGE A HOSTAGE IN THIS VERY DRAMATIC SCENE HAD GONE ON ALL NIGHT ELEVEN HOURS UP TO ONE HUNDRED COMMANDOS IS THAT RIGHT INVOLVED IN THIS RAID IT THEY CLEARLY WENT IN VERY HARD IN THE LOCAL PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF GUNFIRE THERE EXPLOSIONS AND THERE'D BEEN A VERY LONG STAND UP AND BASICALLY ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT IT WENT VERY QUIET WE'RE TALKING TO SOME LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO WERE JUST NEARBY AND THEY WERE SAYING SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS SILENT AND ALL THE POLICE WERE SAYING WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ANY LIVE REPORTING FROM LOCAL MEDIA AND THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO NEGOTIATE TO SEE IF THEY COULD GET THE HOSTAGES OUT CLEARLY WHATEVER NEGOTIATIONS THEY TRIED DIDN'T WORK AND THEY DECIDED THEY HAD TO GO IN HARD QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE RESCUE BUT QUITE A LOT OF DEATHS AS WELL IT SEEMS
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T GOT THE FULL PICTURE YET ONE THING THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT ABOUT REPORTING THIS OVERNIGHT AS WE HAVEN'T BEEN SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE AND HOW MANY FOREIGNERS ARE INSIDE THIS IS A VERY WEALTHY AFFLUENT AREA TO DIPLOMATIC QUARTER A LOT OF INTERNATIONALS WERE THOUGHT TO BE INSIDE
ONE EYEWITNESS HAD SAID HE THOUGHT AT LEAST TWENTY FOREIGNERS WERE INSIDE WE DON'T KNOW YET AND CERTAINLY EARLIES EARLY REPORTS SUGGEST THAT SOME FOREIGNERS HAVE BEEN KILLED AS WELL AS MANY HAVING BEEN RESCUED AND OF THE NATIONALITIES WE KNOW OF A LARGE NUMBER OF JAPANESE ALL INVOLVED IS THIS WRITING IN A PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT APPARENTLY CERTAINLY AND THEY TALKED ABOUT A GROUP OF SEVEN JAPANESE PEOPLE ALL SITTING TOGETHER HAVING DINNER AND THERE WERE ALSO SOME SRI LANKA AND MY BELIEVE SOME ITALIANS IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL EUROPEAN STYLE BAKERY AND CAFE AND THIS WAS THE IT'S RAMADAN OF COURSE WANT TO PEOPLE BROKEN THEY'RE FAST A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GATHERED THERE TO EAT
AND ONCE AGAIN IT'S FORCES OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY SIGNIFICANT THIS ISN'T IT BECAUSE THE BANGLADESHI GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO ACCEPT THAT THEY EXIST IN THE COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA AND SHE'S TALKING IN GENERAL TERMS ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE SECURITY AND THE NEED TO CRACK DOWN ON TERRORISM WHICH THEY'RE UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING
IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE SECURITY SITUATION IT DOES SEEM TO BE WORSENING THIS SORT OF ATTACK SUGGEST THE SITUATION IS ESCALATING FIRST OF ALL SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY NEED TO BE SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE HAVE THESE TWO NARRATIVES ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY BUT THE BANGLADESHI GOVERNMENT SAYING WE DON'T BELIEVE THEM WE THINK IT'S HOME GROWN GROUPS JOHN MCGOVERN THANK YOU JOIN US

BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE PRODUCED A POWDER THAT APPARENTLY CAN SWITCH OFF CRAVINGS FOR SUGAR AND CHOCOLATE AT ACCORDING TO THE DAILY EXPRESS THE PAPER SAYS WHEN TAKEN IN MILK IT WORKS BY RELEASING A COMPOUND IN THE GUT
WHICH SEND SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN TO REDUCE APPETITE THE TIMES CALLS IT A MAGIC MILKSHAKE AND RECKONS THAT IF WILLY WONKA QUIT THE CHOCOLATE INDUSTRY CAN BE PUT IN CHARGE OF THE NATION'S OR BE SETTEE CRISIS A MAGIC POWDER IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING HE WOULD HAVE DEVISED THE TIMES EIGHTY MADE AS TO WHAT IT IS MEET THE AUTHOR TIME AT THE LATEST STUFF JIM'S SERIES OF INTERVIEWS OF WRITERS THIS WEEK HE'S BEEN TALKING TO GEOFF DYER ABOUT HIS LATEST BOOK OF ESSAYS
GEOFF DYER HAS A DEVOTED FOLLOWING WITH THAT HE'S PRODUCING FICTION OR TRAVEL WRITING HE HAS AN ORIGINAL PEN IN HIS NEW BOOK QUITE SANDS HE'S TRAVELLING TO FRENCH POLYNESIA THE STRANGE WASTELANDS OF NEW MEXICO TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY IN BEIJING AND IN THE COURSE OF IT TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND THE BUSINESS OF WRITING
ALSO REISSUED THIS MONTH IS A REMARKABLE BOOK HE PRODUCED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE MISSING OF THE SOMME
WHEN WE SAT DOWN I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE HUMAN NEED TO EXPLORE
YEAH I'VE GOT THAT IMPULSE I THINK BECAUSE I GREW UP IN A FAMILY WHERE WE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE WE OCCASIONALLY HAVE THESE DISMAL LITTLE HOLIDAYS BUT SINCE MY DAD
HATED MORE THAN ANYTHING SPENDING MONEY HOLIDAYS WERE KINDA TORTURE FOR HIM SO I DID I SHE DIDN'T GET ON A PLANE TILL I WAS ABOUT TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE AND AS AN ADULT THOUGH I'VE REALLY BECOME CONSCIOUS THAT JOKE I'VE MADE BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS THE BEST PLANET NONE OF THE OTHERS COME WITHIN A MILLION MILES OF IT SO IT'S REALLY WORTH HAVING IT HAVING A GOOD LOOK ROUND YOU BEGIN THIS BOOK QUITE SANDS WHICH YOU SUBTITLE EXPERIENCES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD BY GOING TO
FRENCH POLYNESIA IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF GAUGUIN THE ARTIST NOW AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT AT ALL TO BE WHAT YOU'D EXPECT NO THAT WAS A REALLY FOOLISH TRIP IN A WAY COS I DIDN'T JUST WANT TO GO TO FRENCH POLYNESIA I WANTED TO STEP INSIDE A GAUGUIN PAINTING AND THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE IN FACT IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR GAUGUIN AFTER A CERTAIN TIME YOU KNOW HE WENT BACK TO PARIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN WHEN HE CAME BACK TO FRENCH POT TO TAHITI
HE FOUND THAT IT WASN'T OFFERING HIM THEIR VERSION OF PARADISE THAT HE WANTED SO HE YOU KNOW HE UPPED STICKS AGAIN AND ENDED UP IN EITHER I MEAN REALLY AT THE AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH WITH THE ENDS OF THE EARTH DO SEEM TO ATTRACT NEW MEXICO FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH IT'S
NOT EXACTLY THE MIDDLE BIT NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO SOME DEGREE A VERY REMOTE PLACE BECAUSE IT HAS THESE EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL DESERT LANDSCAPES HE OBVIOUSLY FIND IT A VERY EVOCATIVE PLACE YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S KIND OF NATURAL REALLY IF YOU IF YOU GROW UP IN WHAT LAURENT D.H. LAWRENCE DESCRIBED AS A COUNTRY THE SIZE OF SOMEBODY'S BACK GARDEN I THINK IT'S
YOU GET THIS IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE THIS SENSE OF AN ENORMOUS BURDEN A METEOROLOGICAL BURDEN BEING LIFTED FROM YOUR SHOULDERS WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELVES IN THERE YOURSELF IN THERE IN THE VAST LANDSCAPES AND THE HUGE SKIES OF THE AMERICAN SOUTH WEST I WENT THERE I SHOULD SAY NOT JUST TO EXPERIENCE
NEW MEXICO GENERALLY BUT FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON TO SPEND THE NIGHT WATERED TO MARIA'S LIGHTNING FEEL THAT LAND ART INSTALLATION OF IT'S A GRID OF MAYBE A MILE BY A KILOMETRE OF THESE LONG STEEL POLES WHICH ALLEGEDLY ATTRACT LIGHTNING ALTHOUGH IT'S STILL QUITE A RARE OCCURRENCE FOR THERE TO BE LIGHTNING THERE'S A CONNECTION AS WELL BETWEEN THAT EXPERIENCE AND ONE YOU HAD
WHAT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW WHICH WAS YOUR FIRST VISIT TO THE BATTLEFIELDS OF THE SOMME OR KNEW HE WROTE AN ACCOUNT OF THAT BUT THE MISSING OF THE SOMME WHICH HAS BEEN RE ISSUED FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL THINKING ABOUT THE CENTENARY OF THAT HORRIFIC AND COUNTER LASTING NEARLY SIX MONTHS
RIGHT NOW WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR YOU WHEN YOU FIRST WALKED ACROSS THAT LANDSCAPE YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE CONNECTION THERE'S WATER DE MARIA'S LIGHTNING FIELD ALL DAY AS SMITHSON SPIRAL JETTY THAT I WRITE ABOUT THESE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SOME SORT OF PERMANENT MARK ON THE LANDSCAPE AND IN THE EARLY NINETIES I WAS LIVING IN PARIS AND I DID SOMETHING I'D WANTED TO DO FOR A WHILE TO VISIT THE CEMETERIES OF THE WESTERN FRONT WITH NO REAL
A NOTION OF WHAT I'D FIND THERE AND THEN I CAME TO THIS MEMORIAL AT DESIGNED BY SIR EDWIN LUCK CHINS AND SAW IN THE DISTANCE IN THESE HUGE LETTERS THE MISSING OF THE SOMME AND SO MUCH SEEM TO CONVERGE THERE THE SOMME IT WAS A WERE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SINGLE MOSSY SYLLABLES ONE HUNG OVER MY CHILDHOOD
AND I WAS AWARE OF TWO THINGS REALLY ONE THEIR INCREDIBLE SENSE OF SOME SORT OF POWER CONVERGING ON THIS PLACE THIS MEMORIAL WHERE SOMETHING AS YOU SAY IT'S SO TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED BUT ALSO AN INCREDIBLE AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF POWER EMANATING FROM IT THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR LEFT I WONDER IF THE FIRST WORLD WAR WILL HAVE THE KIND OF HOLD ON FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT IT DID FOR ME
BUT THEN ALSO I'M VERY CONSCIOUS THAT BEFORE ME POETS LIKE SIR SOON WERE ALWAYS SAYING IT WILL BE THE DAY THEY WERE CONSTANTLY HAVING THAT ANXIETY OF MINE WILL PEOPLE REMEMBER THIS AND IN A WAY IT'S THAT CONSTANT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THE WAR WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HAS GUARANTEED THAT IT WILL BE
GEOFF DYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND IT IS TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND ASK TO DO THIS MORNING IS MARTYN ROWE WRITER AND JENNA'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING AND APOLOGIES FOR THE VOICE BECOMES REAL WELSH ON THE MORNING AFTER
POETRY IS HAVING A MOMENT AFTER THE SHOOTINGS IN ORLANDO LAST MONTH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BEGAN SHARING A POEM CALLED GOOD BONES BY AMERICAN WRITER MAGGIE SMITH IT RECORDS SOME OF THE DARK TRUTHS IN LIFE THAT A PARENT WOULD RATHER THEIR CHILD REMAINED BLISSFULLY IGNORANT OF
FOR EVERY KIND STRANGER SHE WRITES THERE IS ONE WHO WOULD BREAK YOU THOUGH I KEEP THIS FROM MY CHILDREN
THE VIRAL ACCLAIM FOR GOOD BONES WAS MATCHED BY A POEM FROM BRIAN BILL STON OFTEN CALLED THE POET LORETTA'S TWITTER WILSON COMES UP WITH IMAGES TO SYMBOLISE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ENGLAND IS A CUP OF TEA FRANCE WE'LL HAVE RIPEN BRIE IN HER POEM BALDLY TITLED AMERICA IS A GUN
THE CONFERENCE IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES WITH A VIBRANT SOCIAL MEDIA ALSO CAST ESTABLISHED POETS INTO NEW LIGHT PHILIP LARKIN'S THE MOA WAS RE DISCOVERED AFTER THE TRAGIC DEATH OF M.P. JOE COX WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL OF EACH OTHER RIGHTS LARKIN WE SHOULD BE KIND WHILE THERE IS STILL TIME
IN DAYS OF UNCERTAINTY WHEN ONE SHOCK FOLLOWS ANOTHER AND WE FIND OURSELVES WINDED ON THE ROPES MANY OF US TURN TO POETRY POLITICIANS PRESCRIBED JOURNALISTS ANNALISE AND ACADEMICS HYPOTHESISED BUT THE POET MAINLY DESCRIBES SHE IMAGINES ANOTHER KIND OF WORLD DIVINING GOOD WORDS WHEN MOST OF US ARE STRUCK DUMB AS I RETURNED A POET WEDDINGS OR FUNERALS AND UNLIKE LIKE POLITICS POETRY ISN'T BINARY HE DOESN'T BULLY WITH IT EITHER
INSTEAD AS GEOFFREY HILL WHO DIED YESTERDAY PUT IT IN THE TRIUMPH OF LOVE POEMS CONSOLE US WITH HER OWN GIFT WHICH IS LIKE PERFECT PITCH
IT'S TRUE THAT LIKE RELIGION POETRY CAN BECOME A RAREFIED AND PRETENTIOUS BUT WITH A LITTLE SHELF FROM SOCIAL MEDIA IS ALSO FINDING A NEW HOME IN THE ORDINARY WHERE RELIGION ONCE WAS WHEN IT TOO WAS A POEM
WHAT ARE THE BOOK OF PSALMS THE STORIES OF GENESIS OR THE PARABLES OF JESUS IF NOT POETRY
THINK OF IT THIS WAY SAID THE POLISH WRITER CHESLER ME LUSH FOR A POET A HUMAN BEING AS A MYSTERY AND THIS IS A RELIGIOUS FEELING IN EVERY DAY'S LIKE OURS POETRY TAKES ON A PSALM LIKE QUALITY LIKE GOOD RELIGION IT SAYS THINGS WE HADN'T GUESSED WERE SALEABLE BECOMES A COMPASS TO HELP NAVIGATE THE STORMY WEATHER
A SONG OR A POEM CAN ORIENTATE YOU SAYS THEOLOGIAN WALTER BREW THEM AND IT CAN REMIND YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND IT CAN DISORIENTATE YOU YOU CAN TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN
BUT SOMETIMES IT WILL UTTERLY RE ORIENTATE YOU THAT'S WHEN IT GIVES US ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING SUGGESTS ANOTHER ROAD TO TAKE THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME THY ROD HER MY STAFF THEY COMFORT ME
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MARTIN ARE OVERTIME NOW ATTEMPT TO WAIT HERE IS WHAT THE CANDIDATES FOR CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER SEEM TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'D LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY GET ELECTED BY THE PARTY THEN AT THE MOMENT OF THEIR CHOOSING INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTEEN THE NOW FAMOUS ESCAPE MECHANISM THEY MIGHT NOT DO IT IMMEDIATELY BUT EVENTUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER IS THE PERSON WHO SENDS THAT FATEFUL MESSAGE
BUT WAIT SOME LAWYERS SAY IT WILL NOT BE HIS OR HER JOB AS PRIME MINISTER IT IS PARLIAMENT'S JOB
AND THAT OF COURSE MEANS SHE WOULD NEED A MAJORITY OF M.P.S WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT IN OTHER WORDS THEY MIGHT SAY THE TERMS DON'T LOOK GOOD WE WON'T AT THE MOMENT VOTE FOR IT IS THIS A SERIOUS PROSPECT IS THAT PROPERLY
A DISAGREEMENT AMONG LAWYERS ABOUT ALL OF THIS LET US TALK TO BARONESS HELENA KENNEDY WHO IS A LABOUR PEER AND ACTUALLY CHAIRS THE JUSTICE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS SELECT COMMITTEE ON EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AND ON THE LINE IS KARL GARDNER HE'S A FORMER GOVERNMENT LAWYER WRITER ON CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS MORNING YOU BOTH RUNNING FIRST OF ALL CAR GARBO WHO DO YOU THINK TRIGGERS ARTICLE FIFTY
I THINK IT'S FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY THERE'S THE PREROGATIVE POWER IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS GOVERNMENT CAN DO A WIDE RANGE OF THINGS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT CAN DO IS IS TRIGGERED ARTICLE FIFTY SO PARLIAMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT THE PRIME MINISTER THE CABINET DECIDE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO DO IT THEY DO IT AND THAT'S IT
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH JUST IN BETWEEN IF YOU LIKE THE POLITICAL CLAIM BUT TIM FARRON WAS MAKING EARLIER THAN THEM ALL TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS NOW I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT I AM AND ON THE OTHER HAND I'M NOT SURE STRONGER ALL THE EAGLE CLAY THAT IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY WITHOUT LEGISLATION LIKE AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT AND I THINK THAT'S STRONGER LEGAL CLAIM THOUGH IT'S HAD SOME EMINENT LEGAL BACKING PARTICULARLY FROM LORD PANIC IN THE TIMES THE OTHER DAY I THINK THAT STRONGER LEGAL CLAIM IT IS WRONG HELENA KENNEDY WELL IT GOES BEYOND LORD PANIC THERE'S BEEN THERE HE'S AT THE BAR A CONSTITUTIONAL A GROUP OF SENIOR LAWYERS WHO'VE ALSO SET MOVEMENT THREE OF THEIR LEADING LIGHTS
HAVE COME FORWARD SAYING THAT ACTUALLY THIS WAS BACK TO OUR THE OLD ISSUE OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY WHICH OF COURSE WAS AT THE HEART OF THE BRICKS THAT ISSUES TO AND TO HEAR THAT IT WOULD BE UNSATISFACTORY ON SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS THIS THAT YOU HAD THE PRIME MINISTER USING A PREROGATIVE POWER WHICH HAS THOSE RATHER BIZARRE POWERS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INVESTED IN PRIME MINISTER'S ANTIQUING ON FROM WHAT USED TO BE VESTED IN THE KING OR QUEEN
AND THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO WHAT OUR CORE PRINCIPLE IN OUR CONSTITUTION IS WHICH IS THAT PARLIAMENT SHOULD DECIDE SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS THIS AND YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS LEGISLATION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH TOOK US INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WHICH AGREED TO A SURRENDERING OF ASSERTION AND MY MENTOR OF CIRCUMSCRIBED OF SURRENDER
OF SOME OF OUR OWN PARLIAMENTARY POWERS AND AND THIS WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK WHERE YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE PARLIAMENT SIDING OR ARE WE GOING TO GET RID OF THAT BACK THAT'S THE POINT CAR GARDENER ISN'T IT THAT THAT LORD PANIC MADE IN THE TIMES WHICH IS THAT ACTUALLY WHERE WHERE THERE IS AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT THAT IS BEING ALTERED THEN IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PAROLE BUT IT SHOULD BE INVOLVED
HE DOES ARGUE THAT BOOK BUT THE FACT IS THAT ARTICLE FIFTY NOTIFICATION DOES NOT CHANGE THE LAW IN THIS IT WOULD LEAD TO THE LOBBING CHANGED EVENTUALLY WOULDN'T IT I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BOUGHT THE ARGUMENT BEING MADE IS THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT COMPLETELY NEW KATRI ALIEN NOW THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR ONE OF THE TREATIES GIVEN EFFECTIVE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO ACTS IS THE AGREEMENTS ON THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
FOR INSTANCE IT MIGHT BE OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THAT SURVIVE AT THE AT THE OTHER THING IS I'VE GOT TO SAY JUST THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN TRIED IN COURT BY LORD PANIC HIMSELF BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN LORD REES MOGG WAS
CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT'S RATIFICATION OF THE MAASTRICHT TREATY VERY SIMILAR ARGUMENTS YOU REACHED THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO THIS ON ITS OWN AND THE HIGH COURT GAVE GAVE THAT ARGUMENT VERY SHORT SHRIFT THEN
SO IT WAS UNABLE TO ACCEPT IT SO I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S CHANGED SINCE THAT I WHO WILL DECIDE THIS TIME ROUND HER WELL IT'S INTERESTING I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU CAN JUST OVERTURN WATCH OUT THE REFERENDUM RESULT WAS I THINK THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT DOING THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BE OUTRAGED AND IT COULD LEAD TO CONSTRUCT A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE DO ALSO FEEL THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED FOR DIFFERENT THINGS
BUT THE QUESTION ITSELF DIDN'T ELUCIDATE WHAT IT WAS PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING SOME PEOPLE WANT IT WANTED IMMIGRATION IT WAS ILLEGALLY IMPACT ON THE LAW AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT IT'S INTERESTING I THINK THAT OUR JUDGES ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO BE VERY RELUCTANT I THINK TO INTERFERE HERE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF INTERFERING IN SOMETHING THAT'S ABOUT BUT IT WAS THE REFERENDA
AH TO ADVISE THE QUESTION IS WHO DID IT WHO ARE THE ADVISORY TO ARE THE ADVISORY TO PARLIAMENT OR THE ADVISER TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND WE DON'T KNOW SETTLE WHO THE PRIME MINISTER IS AT THE MOMENT AND SO I THINK THAT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS A ROLE FOR PARLIAMENT WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WERE WHERE PARLIAMENT PARLIAMENT BASICALLY TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE
HALF THE POPULATION ALMOST DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE AND AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW THINKING ACTUALLY WE DIDN'T REALISE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL OF THIS AND WHAT WAS ON OFFER WAS NOT BEING SO TALL TWO AS IN A VERY HONEST WAY CARL GARDEN AT THE OTHER THING TEN FOUND MUST TELLING US HALF AN HOUR AGO WAS THAT ACTUALLY ARTICLE FIFTY COULD BE KIND OF I'M RIVER UNE INVOKED SIR HUGH JUST YOU STOP HALFWAY THROUGH AND SAY WE DON'T FANCY THIS ANY MORE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THESE THINGS THAT TRIP
I DON'T THINK ARTICLE FIFTY SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS AND IT'S ACTUAL EXPLICIT TO THIS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EXPLICIT PROVISION FOR FORGOT WE WERE BACK ON NOTIFICATION SO HAVE I LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION I THINK IF BRITAIN GOT TO THAT POINT CHANGED ITS MIND AND ARE E.U. PARTNERS UNIT ON UNANIMOUSLY AGREED WITH ALL THIS I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE A PROBLEM WITH GOING BACK ON NOTIFICATION IF THERE WAS A GRIP IF THERE WERE AN AGREEMENT
WE'D BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TERRITORY AND POSSIBLY A BIG LEGAL ARGH HELENA KENNEDY TEN SECOND ARTICLE FIFTY IS NOT A GUILLOTINE I GOT ARTICLE FIFTY WAS BROUGHT IN TO HELP THE COUNTRY THAT WAS WANTING TO LEAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE NOW IT WITH NOAH AND BOOK THIS AND THEREFORE WE'RE GOING INTO THIS TWO YEAR PERIOD AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO GO AND I THINK THAT IF YOU HAD AGREEMENT AMONG BOTH THE PARTY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY THINKING HE WANTED TO LEAVE AND THE MEMBER COUNTRIES THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN A STEP BACK AND I HOPE STEPPING BACK IS WHAT WE'LL DO
ALL IS NOW CLAIRE BARONESS AND A KENNEL CLARITY FROM LAWYER A GARDENER AS WELL THANKS PLACE THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT PETER GIBBS WILL BE CLEAR ABOUT THE WEATHER BECAUSE I'LL DO MY BEST NICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL I CAN BE CLEARED IT'S A BIT ON THE COOL SIDE WAS A TOUCH OF FROST LAST NIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN SCOTLAND SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS IS THE FORECAST REALLY FOR MOST OF US TODAY ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES SOME SHOWERS ALREADY ACROSS NORTH WEST ENGLAND AND THROUGH WALES WILL BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES

JOHN TOSHACK PHIL'S DEAD THANK YOU JOIN US
IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT JEREMY CORBIN IS STILL THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY SURVIVED ANOTHER WEEK ALTHOUGH HIS SHADOW MINISTERIAL TEAM IS A BIT OF A MESS LOT OF FRONT BENCH POSTS UNFILLED ME ACTUAL THREATENED EFFORT TO GET RID OF HIM THOUGH HASN'T MATERIALISED AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE FIGHTING BACK MOST OF THE SUPPORTERS ARE OF COURSE NOT N. PEAS BUT THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD AMONGST M.P.S AND THEY HELD THEIR LOCAL CONSTITUENCY SURGERIES THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL
JEREMY CALL AN ALLY OF COURSE WAS DEFENDING THEIR RIGHT TO HOPE THESE PROTESTS IN A MOMENT WE WILL HEAR FROM MOMENTUM THE MOVEMENT THE BACKS MADE HER BUT FIRST WHAT ABOUT THE PROCESS ONE OF THEIR TARGETS AS BEEN NEIL COIL THE M.P. FOR BIRMAN SEEN OLD SOUTHWARK LONDON CHATTER ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALERTED HIM TO PLANS FOR A PROTEST YESTERDAY WHEN HE WAS HOLDING HIS REGULAR SURGERY FOR CONSTITUENTS' SUCH A BERK WENT ALONG
I'M STANDING ON TOWER BRIDGE ROAD IN SOUTH LONDON OUTSIDE THE SURGERY OF NEIL COIL IN P. ONE OF THE SHADOW CABINET WHO RESIGNED A FEW DAYS AGO
IT WAS RUMOURED ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE
PROTEST HERE BY THOSE LOYAL TO JEREMY CORBIN THE POLICE
AS IT HAPPENED THERE WERE JUST A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE
THEY WERE THEY SAID MEMBERS AND COULD STITCH
I CAME TO TODAY IS TRY AND FIND SIGNED BY MY LOCAL M.P.
JOINING IN ON THE ATTACK ON JEREMY QUITE THEN I A TIME WHEN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
A LABOUR POLITICIAN OUGHT TO BE ATTACKING THE TOURISTS ARE DRAGGING US INTO THIS AWFUL MESS THAT THE COUNTRIES NOW
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A LEADERSHIP CONTEST IF THERE IS ANY LESS IN FRONT LESLEY'S GONNA WIN AND ASIAN
ONCE AND FOR ALL DOG BEHIND JEREMY CALLED B.
I'M JUST AN UNHAPPY CONSTITUENT WHO DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE'S DONE I THINK WHEN YOU MAKE BIG DECISIONS LIKE THAT AND YOU ARE NEWLY ELECTED
IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE A PUBLIC MEETING
ABOUT PEOPLE'S
BUT ACCORDING TO NEIL COIL THE TONE OF THESE MILD MANNERED PROTESTERS WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS HE AND HIS STAFF HAD RECEIVED
I'M A MEMBER OF MY STAFF ACTUALLY CONTACT THE POLICE BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF CONTACT YOU IN THE WEEK SO REPLACED TRACK WHAT WAS HAPPENING ONLINE AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY DO TO MONITOR THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE SURGERY WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE I DON'T
DON'T WANT THAT AT MY SURGERY I DON'T WANT MY CONSTITUENTS TO FEEL COMING TO SEE ME MEANS THEY HAVE TO PASS POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE MY OFFICE AND NOR DO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR MY STAFF TO FEEL THREATENED OR INTIMIDATED BY ANYONE LEAST OF ALL LABOUR MEMBERS OR PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO BE LABOUR SUPPORTERS WHAT KIND OF THINGS HAVE PEOPLE BEEN SAYING OVER THE PHONE OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS BEING THERE HIS THREATS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURING ILLUSION FOR VIKKI FOX GOT AS WELL BUT ALSO PEOPLE SO IN LIGHT OF THE
POVERTY LIKE PARTY AND COLLECTIVE MOVE THIS WEEK PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WITH MY MEMBERS I'M VERY HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THEM AS WE HAVE TO TALK TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND DEBATE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHERE I FEEL WE NEED TO GO FOR TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF MIND HAS BEEN IN TOUCH HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPORTING WHAT WERE THEY UP HERE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS WEEK
THEY ARE THAT WAS SUCH A BURGER REPORTING FROM SOUTH LONDON LET US TALK NOW TO CHANGE SCHNEIDER WHO IS ON THE LINE HE'S A SPOKESMAN FOR MOMENTUM THAT GRASS ROOTS CAMPAIGN SUPPORTS JEREMY CALLED MY MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING JUST ON THE SUBJECT OF THE APPROACHING I WANT TO GET ON THE WIDER THINGS BUT THE SURGE IN THE PROCESS FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE BASIC MESSAGE FROM A LOT OF THESE N. PEAS IS COOP CALL THE DOGS OFF STOP PUTTING US UNDER THIS KIND OF PRESSURE WHAT DO YOU SAY
I THINK THAT'S WRONG AND OFFENSIVE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY ANYBODY IF THEY EXPRESSING THEIR NEPHEWS TO ANYONE TO M.P.S OR ANYONE ELSE SHOULD NOT TOO PERSONAL ATTACKS AND SHOULD BE CIVIL AND COMRADELY HOWEVER THE IDEA THAT MEMBERS
AND SPEAKING TO THEIR MEMBERS TO THEIR M.P.S AND TELLING THEM THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS AN ANTI DEMOCRATIC THE IDEA THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND THAT THEY ARE DOGS FOR DOING SO IS VERY OFFENSIVE BUT IN THAT CASE WITH THAT PARTICULAR M.P. NEIL COYLE HE SHOWED SOME OF THE MESSAGES TO THE POLICE AND THE POLICE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THEM TURNING UP THAT DOESN'T SUGGEST ANYTHING VERY COMRADELY DOES
NO AND THAT'S I SAY ANYTHING THAT IS NOT ANYTHING THAT'S NOT CIVIL ANY POET ANY PARCEL ABUSE IS WRONG AND IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AND IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND HE'S AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF POLITICS
TO THE WIDER ISSUE WHICH IS A HUGE ONE ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE WERE HERE
PEOPLE SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE PARTY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY HAVE SUGGESTED TO JEREMY CALL THEY COULDN'T GET A MEETING WITH THEM HAVE THEY SUGGESTED TURN THAT SOMEHOW SOME DEAL COULD BE DONE WHERE BY HIS POLICIES LIVE ON IN ONE SHAPE OR ANOTHER THIS IS WON IT WHAT WAS SUGGESTING A NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT BUT THAT IN RETURN HE GOES SET UP RUN IT DO YOU
NO THE THE COUP PLOTTERS
FLAILING ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD TEN MONTHS TO PLOT THIS CLUE AND IT HAD ITS SCENES LIKE IT HAS FAILED JEREMY CALLED OR SHOWN INCREDIBLE STEEL AIDAN AND STAYING THERE AND AND NOT FALLING STAYING THERE ON BEHALF OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE PARTY WHAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO DO IS SUBVERT DEMOCRACY IN THE PARTY IF THEY ARE UNHAPPY WITH JEREMY GORGONS LEADERSHIP
ALL THE POLICIES WHICH HE IS STANDING FOR THEY NEED TO GET FIFTY ONCE IN WHICH IS THEY NEED TO FIND THE CANDIDATE THEY NEED TO FIND THE PLATFORM AND THEY NEED TO AND THEY NEED TO GO FOR IT BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A CANDIDATE TO COMPETE AND THEY'LL TELL YOU SIR I SUPPOSE THEY'LL TELL TRAGEDY ALTERNATIVE AS THEY SET UP THEIR OWN PARTY WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WELCOME IN A SENSE IF THEY WERE TO LEAVE
I WOULDN'T WELCOME I WOULDN'T WELCOMING THEM TO LEAVE I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD DO THEY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE LABOUR PARTY AND THEY SHOULD ENGAGE WITH MEMBERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF THE MEMBERS WANT TO THE PARTY TO CHANGE SO THAT IT IS MORE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATORY ORGANISES WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN JUST SPEAKING AT THE MINUTE AS THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT JEREMY CALLED MUST PUT FORWARD ON ON DEMOCRACY
ON A NEW ECONOMICS IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD THEN THAT'S WHAT THAT I'D THEN I THINK THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD LOOK AT THAT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY IF THERE WAS TO BE AN ELECTION I TAKE YOUR POINT THEY'RE TRIGGERED IT AND PUT IN A LOT BUT IF THEY DID GET ROUND TO DOING THAT HE'LL HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT JEREMY CORBIN WOULD WEAR
I'M CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD BEHAVE WHEN HE'S GOT AN ENORMOUS ABOUT SUPPORT IN IN THE GRASSROOTS I ALSO THINK THAT THE WAY THAT THEY'VE MANAGED THIS OVER LAST WEEK THE INABILITY TO AZTEC TOO AFTER TEN MONTHS OF PLOTTING THIS WAS ALL PLANNED OUT ANGE REGAL HAD REGISTERED LEADERSHIP DOMAIN NAME GOT TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE SHE RESIGNED THIS WAS ALL PLANNED TO DO TO TAP THEM BEFORE THE MAY LOCAL ELECTIONS
I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED HE'D RUN A GOOD LEADERSHIP ELECTION IF THEY CAN'T RUN THIS CREW AND THEY RAN THREE BAD LEADERSHIP ELECTION CAMPAIGNS LAST SUMMER I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT ONE A GOOD CAMPAIGN AND WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE JOINING LABOUR RIGHT NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHOSE SIDE THEY'RE ON WHEN THEY'RE JOINT
I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THEY'RE JOINING TO SUPPORT JEREMY CORBIN IT WAS REPORTED THAT OF THE FIRST THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIXTY OF THEM HAD EXPLICITLY PUT IN THEIR MEMBERSHIP JOINING FORM THIS IS THE FIRST THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE JOINED VERY RECENTLY
YES THE FIRST THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND JOINT THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM HAD EXPLICITLY PUT ON THEIR JOINING FOREMAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ANYTHING ON YOUR DRAWING BUT THEY'D EXPLICITLY PUT THAT THERE WERE JOINING TO SUPPORT CORBIN I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF TRAFFIC COMING TO JOIN DOT LABOUR DOT ORG DOT U.K. WHICH WAY JOIN THE LABOUR PARTY UNLIKE THAT'S COMING FROM PEOPLE'S MOMENTUM DOT COM A WEBSITE
YOU ARE CONVINCED FINALLY JEREMY CALL THEN WILL LEAD THE LABOUR PARTY INTO THE NEXT ELECTION YES

WELL IT IS IT IS IT'S A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT THEY HAVE EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS AND AND THE SECRET GARECH I THINK THEY'RE A TEAM THAT IS JUST HAVING THEIR TIME THE FIRST TIME WALES HAVE BEEN IN A MAJOR TOURNAMENT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT AS I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE WILL KNOW BUT THERE IS AN INFECTIOUS FRESHNESS ABOUT THEM I WOULD SAY
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE GARETH BALE WHO IS THE WORLD'S MOST EXPENSIVE PLAYER IN THAT CERTAINLY HELPS BUT HE'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT INFLUENCE AND INSPIRATION TO THE TEAM THERE'S A CONSISTENT IT SEE TWO SELECTION AS WELL EIGHT OF THE OUTFIELD PLAYERS HAVE STARTED OR FIVE OF THEIR MATCHES AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY WELL MANAGED BY THE MAN WHO PICKS THE TEAM CHRIS COLMAN WHOSE STOCK AND REPUTATION IS RISING ALMOST BY THE MINUTE
AND NOW THEY PLAY PORTUGAL IN AND THEY MUST HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE BUT WHAT AN INTRIGUING MATCH UP GARETH BALE AGAINST RENALDI
A VERY DECENT CHANCE I WOULD SAY AFTER NOT BELIEVING FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THAT LEICESTER CITY COULD WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS SEASON I'M NOT GOING TO FALL INTO THAT TRAP AGAIN YET YOU'RE RIGHT GARY THIS IS GOING TO BE BUILDERS AS THE TWO REAL MADRID TEAM MATES AGAINST EACH OTHER GARETH BALE WHO HAS BEEN THE ULTIMATE TEAM MAN FOR WALES
AGAINST RENELLE DES WHO VERY OFTEN GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE CARRIES HIS TEAM BUT ONE PROBLEM FOR WALES ALREADY TWO OF THOSE EIGHT REGULAR STARTERS I MENTIONED ARRAN RAMSAY AND BEN DAVIES ARE SUSPENDED FOR THE SEMI FINAL AND THEY'LL MISS THEM BOTH

THE B.B.C.'S NEWSNIGHT PROGRAMME HAS LEARNED THAT MEMBERS OF JEREMY CORBIN'S NEW SHADOW CABINET HAVE BEEN DRAWING UP A PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO RESIGN WITH DIGNITY POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP CONTENDERS WOULD SIGN UP TO A STATEMENT OF HIS CORE SET OF BELIEFS IN RETURN FOR HIS AGREEMENT TO STEP DOWN THE PLAN HASN'T YET BEEN PUT TO MISTER CORBIN
THE FORMER LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVES IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S BACKING ANDREA LEAD SOME IN THE RACE TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER HE SAID HIS FELLOW EUROSCEPTIC WAS THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD BRITAIN'S NEGOTIATIONS ON LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE BANGLADESHI PRIME MINISTER SAYS THIRTEEN PEOPLE TAKEN HOSTAGE BY MILITANTS AND DARKER LAST NIGHT HAVE BEEN RESCUED BUT OTHERS WERE KILLED SHE'S HAD SIX OF THE GUN THEN DIED WHEN ELITE FORCES STORMED A CAFE IN THE CAPITAL EARLIER THIS MORNING AND ANOTHER WAS CAPTURED ALIVE
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE WHAT HAS THE EFFECT OF A BRECK'S IT VOTE BEEN ON YOUR JOB YOUR PEG YOU'RE HOME WHAT EFFECT IS IT LIKE YOU'D HAVE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD AND INDEED IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS WE ARGUED ENDLESSLY ABOUT IT BEFORE THE VOTE WITH VERY DIRE WARNINGS FROM THE REMAIN CAMP AND VERY OPTIMISTIC TALK FROM LEAVE TO THESE FORECASTS NEED TO BE UPDATED NOW CAN THEY BE
WE'VE SEEN THE MARKET SWOON AND THEN RECOVER WE'VE SEEN THE CHANCELLOR SAY SUSPENDED HIS PLAN TO RUN A SURPLUS ANOTHER WAS NOT TO BORROW ANYTHING BY TWENTY TWENTY
DOES THAT MEAN AUSTERITY IS REDUCED OR ABANDONED OR WHAT I'M JOINED BY SIR JOHN GAVE FORMER DEPUTY GOVERNOR FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND AS WELL BY ANASTASIA NEST NEST THEIR OVER WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT CITY UNIVERSITY AND ALSO MEMBER OF LABOUR'S ECONOMIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE MORNING TO BACK
CAN WE START WITH WHERE WE ARE DEAD SIR JOHN DEWEY IS IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OUT THERE PROPER HARD EVIDENCE THAT HE'S BECOMING AVAILABLE THAT IS TELLING US WHAT IS HAPPENING
YES IT'S MAINLY SURVEY EVIDENCE BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME WITH THAT INVESTMENT IS FALLING OFF IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY FIRST UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHICH WAY THE REFERENDUM WOULD OBVIOUSLY IT'S TOO EARLY TO GET TO READING SINCE THEN BUT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM BOTH MARK CARNEY NOW GEORGE OSBORNE IS THAT THEY
SEE STRONG SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO GROW LESS FAST THAT THEY'D BEEN EXPECTING HIM BACK AT THE BUDGET TIME IT'S A TART ANECDOTAL THOUGH ISN'T IT AT THE MOMENT WHEN YOU THINK THERE ARE BETTER THEY'RE PROPER DATA FROM COMPANIES SAYING WE WERE GOING TO INVEST THAT WE'RE NOT ANY MORE OR WE HAVE HAD TO CLOSE A FACTORY MOVE IT
WELL THAT COMES IN SLOWLY OVER THE MONTHS THERE ARE VARIOUS SORT OF REGULAR MONTHLY SURVEYS OF EMPLOYER EMPLOYER AN INVESTMENT OPINION CONFIDENCE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SO ON AND THOSE WILL TICKIN HE WENT REALLY GET A READ ON THIS WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO QUANTIFY IT BEFORE
THE AUTUMN SAY THE TIME OF THE AUTUMN STATEMENT ALISTAIR'S IN THERE SET ANOTHER YEAR YOU WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW THEY'LL BE ANECDOTAL STUFF THE AUDIENCE BUT WE WON'T REALLY HAVE AND I THINK PROPER TAKE TO GET A HANDLE ON UNTIL THEY'RE IN TERMS OF HARD DAY SO YES I THINK THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ARE CRUCIAL FOR ANY PLANNING OR ESTIMATE ESTIMATE HE HOW DEEP
A PROTRACTED THEY LIKELY RECESSION IS GOING TO BE BUT THE ANECDOTAL VIEW AT THE MOMENT IS THAT YES SOME COMPANIES ARE PUTTING OFF DOING THINGS SOME PEOPLE WANT TO BUY VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSES PERHAPS AREN'T BUYING THEM ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE COME WHEN THERE IS A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY BUT THIS IS NOT A CLIFF THAT WERE FALLING OFF WELL IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY ONE COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS CRISIS WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND
TODAY'S CONTEXT IS MUCH WORSE IN SOME WAYS THE ULCER WELL THE ECONOMY WENT INTO THIS UNCERTAINTY IMPREGNATE POTENTIAL YEARS OFF
UNRAVELLING IN FINANCIALLY BETTER POSITIONED THE BANKS ON THE REGULATORS ARE BETTER PREPARED
RELATIVELY BETTER CUT CAPITALISED BUT THE OVERALL CONTEXT AS MUCH WEAKER THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS BEEN WEAKENED BY YEARS OF AUSTERITY THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT IS HARSHER THAN IT WAS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM THERE ARE NOW EMERGING MARKETS ARE SUFFERING WHILE FUNDS WITH POCKETS FULL OF CASH READY TO STAB AND PROVIDE LIQUIDITY
OR PURCHASE THE ASSETS OVERALL THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY GLOBAL IS MUCH MORE ACUTE
IT'S NOT IT'S YOUR UP HE'S BEEN AFFECTED BY THE E. VOTE IS STRONGEST PARTNER AT THE MOMENT BUT IT'S ALSO AFFECTED BY THE CRISIS OVERALL THIS BUILT INTO A VERY RISQUE PICTURE AND DOES THAT MEAN SIR JOHN THAT GEORGE OSBORNE WAS RIGHT TO SAY WHAT HE HAS SAID NOW ABOUT WHAT ABANDONING THEIR LUCK THE LAST AS WELL HE SAYS HE'S NOT ABANDONING BUT BUT PUSHING BACK THE LAST OF HIS HIS FISCAL RULES
WELL HE WAS STATING THE OBVIOUS BUT SO IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED ANYWAY YES I MEAN IF THE ECONOMY GOES GROWS MORE SLOWLY AND IT'S NOT A CLIFF EDGE BUT SAY IT GROWS AT HALF THE PACE WE WERE EXPECTING THE DEFICIT WILL BE HIGHER AND WHAT HE WOULD SAY WAS IT WASN'T HIS POLICY TO TRY AND CLOSE THAT BY EXTRA AUSTERITY HE WASN'T SAYING HE WAS GOING TO RELAX ON THE POLICIES AS ALREADY ANNOUNCED BUT HE WASN'T GOING TO BRING IN SOME NEW ONES TO TRY AND CLOSE THAT
AND I SUPPOSE HE WAS ALSO REMINDING PEOPLE THAT HE MAY BE DOWN BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE BUT IN TERMS OF THE DECISION THAT HE MADE OF THE DECISION THAT HE ANNOUNCED SHOULD HE NOW IN YOUR VIEW WOULD BE RIGHT
IN WHY THE EARLY EXCEPT THAT HE'S DOING IT DAY IN INTERVIEWS AND IN POLITICS MORE GENERALLY THAT ACTUALLY BEHIND THE SCENES THAT WE USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE KIND OF BORROWING EMMA KIND OF SPENDING ON PUBLIC WORKS THAT LABOUR HAVE BEEN WANTING DONE FOR SOME TIME
I THINK WHAT WAY OFF THAT THERE THE PROSPECT MOST TO FORECASTERS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GROW MORE SLOWLY WE'RE GOING TO BE POORER IN FUTURE THEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD BETTER SERVICES UNLESS OF COURSE WE'RE WILLING TO RAISE TAXES TO PAY FOR THEM AND WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO DO ALL POOR WE DON'T HAVE TO BORROW MONEY AT EXTREMELY CHEAP RATE WITHOUT BEING PENALISED INTERNATIONALLY AS WE THOUGHT ONCE THAT WE WOULD BE
WE WERE IN A VERY VULNERABLE POSITION WE'VE GOT NO PLAN WE'RE ON OUR WAY OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT OF SEVEN PER CENT OF G. P. THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY WHERE STILL BORROWING WELL OVER FIFTY BILLION ON FOR THE BUDGET WE NEED FOREIGN FOREIGN INVESTORS TO CONTINUE PUTTING MONEY IN
WE NEED TO CONVINCE THEM THAT WE'RE GOING IN TIME NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT IN TIME TO CLOSE THAT GAP WHERE WHAT ARE YOU ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT ANASTASIA DO YOU THINK WE DO HAVE A BIT MORE WIGGLE ROOM THAN WE AT LEAST PUBLICLY ACCEPTED THAT WE HAD WITH A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY ACCEPTED THAT WE HAD BEFORE THE BRAKES
NOW AFTER THIS YES I THINK IT WILL BE WELCOMED BY THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WHO ARE STARVED OF GOOD QUALITY COLLATERAL
SO SHE STAYED THAT OF PUBLIC DEBT AND ESPECIALLY HIGH QUALITY DEPT USUALLY PERFORMS TWO ROLLS IT'S A MODE OF RAISING FUNDING FOR THE STATE WHEN IT BORROWS BUT ALSO IT FUNCTIONS AS A VERY IMPORTANT LUBRICANT FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM THIS IS HOW TRANSACTIONS ARE STRUCTURED IT SERVES AS COLLATERAL AND JUST BEFORE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VARIOUS ESTIMATES PUT THE SKY CITY OF COLLATERAL FOR THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS BETWEEN ONE TO FOUR TRILLION THERE WERE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES BUT IT WAS CLEAR THAT
BANKS ON MARKETS INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS NEEDED THIS ASSETS TO INVEST AS IN THAT'S HOW YOU SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE THAT THE TERMS OF ALL OF THIS DISCUSSION HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY THE BRECK'S VOTE AND THAT ACTUALLY WHERE WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE PENALISED INTERNATIONALLY IF WE DIDN'T HOLD TO AUSTERITY ACTUALLY THE GAME HAS CHANGED
THE GAME WAS EVER I BELIEVE THE GAME WAS THERE IT SAID IT WAS BUT THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD YOU WHAT BECAUSE HOPE PHENOMENALLY ECONOMICALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IN THE LOGIC BUT NOW YES POTENTIALLY THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IF MANAGED WITH A PROGRAMME OR SOME AGENDA AND I AGREE WITH SIR JOHN THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A PLANNING OR STRATEGIC THINKING AS TO WHAT TO DO NOW IF THEY WILL BE BORROWING WHAT ARE DOING WITH INCOMES BUT SIR JOHN IF THEY CAME UP WITH THE STRATEGIC PLAN
THEN DO YOU AGREE THAT THE TERMS OF THE DEBATE HAVE CHANGED AND ACTUALLY AS A NATION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ALL OF THIS IN A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO OUR OWN FUTURE
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT WE'RE IN A WORSE POSITION THEREFORE WHICH WERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO TO CONTINUE TO RAISE MONEY OF COURSE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER WE NEED A SURPLUS THAT WAS ALWAYS ARGUABLE YES ABSOLUTELY
FOREIGN INVESTORS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO BUY OUR GUILT BECAUSE YOU KNEW TO SUPPORTERS MORE THAN PERHAPS WE EXPECTED BUT WE'RE MORE VULNERABLE NOW THAT WE'RE ON OUR OWN AND WE FACE A POORER ECONOMIC PROSPECT
AND THE STAIRS ARE FEDERAL OVER AND SIR JUNKIE THANKS BOTH VERY MUCH TWENTY TO NINE A TIME TO LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS MOST ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THERESA MAY IS WELL AHEAD IN THE RACE TO BE THE NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND OF COURSE ON EX PRIME MINISTER MAY MENTOR IS THE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MAIL IT REPORTS SHE'S HAD THE BACKING OF MORE M.P.S THAN A RIVALS PUT TOGETHER IN A PROFILE OF THE HOME SECRETARY THE PAPER PRINTS AN OLD PHOTO OF MISSUS MAY
WEARING A BLUE SUIT NEXT TO A PICTURE OF A SIMILARLY DRESSED MARGARET THATCHER WITH THE CAPTION REMIND YOU OF ANYONE ACCORDING TO THE TIMES MICHAEL GOES IN A STRUGGLE JUST TO STAY IN THE CONTEST ONLY TWO CANDIDATES WILL GO FORWARD TO THE FINAL BALLOT OF GRASSROOTS TORIES AND THE PAPER BELIEVES MORE M.P.S ARE LINING UP BEHIND THE ENERGY MINISTER ANDREW LETS MY GOPHER IN ITS EDITORIAL THE TIMES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT M.P.S HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT MY GOES ENTRY INTO THE CONTENTS BUT ARGUES THAT HIS CREDENTIALS AS A REFORMER AND A REFERENDUM WHEN ARE HARD TO BEAT AND HE CONCLUDES IT WOULD BE
LAST OF THE VITAL DEBATE ON BRITAIN'S FUTURE IF HE WERE ELIMINATED EARLY THE DAILY EXPRESS ALSO NOTES THE RISE IN SPORT FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME WHOM HE CALLS THE BRICKS IT BLONDE IT SUGGEST THAT HER EMERGENCE AS A SERIOUS CONTENDER APPEARS TO HAVE ENDED THEIR HOPES OF THERESA MAY'S SUPPORTERS BUT THE CONTEST WOULD BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD CORONATION SOME M.P.S HAVE TOLD THE GUARDIAN THERE PREPARED TO BACK MISSUS LIPTON SIMPLY TO REDUCE MY GOES CHANCES ARE MAKING THEIR FINAL TO THE GUARDIAN'S LEAD LEADER COLUMN SAYS MISSUS MAY OFFERS THE PROVERBIAL SAFE
BUT A PARTY CRAVES WHEN THE GOING IS TOUGH BUT CONCLUDES THAT THE TORY GOVERNMENT HAS LED BRITAIN TO A DISASTROUS PLACE AND THE NEXT LEADER WILL NEED A LOT MORE THAN SAFE HANDS TO STEER BRITAIN TOWARDS ITS LAND OF LOST CONTENT
THE BATTERED TIMES REPORTS THAT BRITISH BOSSES HELD IN HAVING THE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS WE JUST BE HAVING ON THIS PROGRAMME AND THEY HAVE TAKEN A VIEW OF IT THEY'VE SNAPPED UP SHARES AND THEIR OWN COMPANIES HAD UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF STOCK PRICES FELL FOLLOWING THE BRAKES IT WROTE THAT PAPER SAYS THE LLOYDS BANKING GROUP CHIEF ANTONIA WATER SORRY OH AND THE ROYAL MAIL BOSS MY GREEN
ARE AMONG THOSE BOSSES AND ACCORDING TO PAPER ONE HUNDRED COMPANY DIRECTORS BOUGHT SHARES WORTH FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS A MARKET ANALYST TELLS THEM IT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK THEIR SHARES HAVE FALLEN
FAR TOO FAR AND THE COMPANY'S VALUE WILL BOUNCE BACK THE F.T. ITSELF COMES IN FOR SOME FLACK FROM ONE OF ITS RIVALS THE DAILY MAIL EDITORIAL DESCRIBES IT AS BRITAIN'S MOST SELF IMPORTANT BUSINESS NEWSPAPER AND ACCUSES IT OF BEING THE PANIC MUNGAR IN CHIEF SINCE THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT QUOTES WHAT IT CALLS DOOM LADEN HEADLINES SUCH AS BRITAIN IS STARTING TO IMITATE GREASE AND ASKS IF IT'S DETERMINED TO PROVOKE A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IN A BID TO JUSTIFY ITS LURID PREDICTION
THE TALE OF A SACKED POSTIE FEATURES IN SEVERAL PAPERS THE TIMES DESCRIBES RICHARD CAMPERS BRITAIN'S SLOWEST POSTMAN IT EXPLAINS HE WAS FIRED BY A ROYAL MAIL AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR DELIVERING LETTERS IN THE DEVON VILLAGE OF KENTISH BEER BECAUSE HE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME TALKING TO PEOPLE ON HIS ROUNDS THE PAPER SAYS TO THE FIRST CLASS CAMPAIGN FROM HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS TO GET HIM REINSTATED SOME VERSION OF THE STORY IS UNDER THE HEADLINE POSTMAN CHAT
SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE BRITISH MUSEUM'S BEEN UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS TAKING OVER FROM NEIL MACGREGOR THE MAN OF COURSE WHO BROUGHT US THE WORLD IN ONE HUNDRED OBJECTS WAS NEVER GOING TO BE AN EASY TASK THE MAN WHO DID IT THOUGH WAS HOT THICK FISHER HE'S THE NEW BROOM AND HE'S BEEN TALKING TO OUR ARTS EDITOR WILL GUMPERT SUE JOINT IS ON THE LINE MORNING SHE WILL WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY NO I'M NOT A LOT HE'S QUITE CIRCUMSPECT
HE IS I SUPPOSE IF YOU COULD YOU COULD CHARACTERISE IT COULD CHARACTERISE MACGREGOR AS A SORT OF THE CHARISMATIC CLASSROOM TEACHER THAT WAS HIS ROLE AND WE ALL EXPERIENCE THAT AS HE SAID IN THE WORLD IN ONE HUNDRED OBJECTS I THINK FISCHER WOULD BE FAIRLY DESCRIBED AS A SORT OF MORE A PROFESSOR GIVING A TUTORIAL HE'S FAR MORE
CIRCUS BUT TO BE FAIR TO HIM THOUGH HE HAS SPENT THE LAST THREE MONTHS GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT ALL THE PARTNERS THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAS GOT AS WELL AS MEETING HIS THOUSAND ODD STAFF AND GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THE COLLECTION IT IS A MAMMOTH TASK THAT HE'S TAKEN ON AND HE'S QUITE RIGHT NOT TO TRY AND SORT HER OUT SHOWMAN MACGREGOR OF COURSE AND JUST FIND HIS OWN PACE AND PLACE I MEAN ONE BIG THING I SUPPOSE FOR HIM HE HADN'T ANTICIPATED WHEN HE TOOK ON THE JOB WAS
BRECK'S IT WHICH IS GOING TO AFFECT THE ARTS AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT MAJOR INSTITUTION LIKE THE BRITISH MUSEUM HE WAS REASONABLY BULLISH HE'S IT HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THE MUSEUM HAD A ROLE TO PLAY IN HELPING BIND THEIR COUNTRY AND NAVIGATE THROUGH ITS CRISIS IF IT IS INDEED A CRISIS BY SHOWING THE OBJECTS WHICH TOLD US TELLS US STORIES OF THE HOW BRITAIN HAS OVERCOME DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN THE PAST I ALSO ASKED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS BACKGROUND HE'S A GERMAN NATIONAL WHO HAD
LIVED THROUGH THE REUNIFICATION WHO HAD BEEN A REFUGEE WHOSE PARENTS HAD FOUND THEMSELVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BERLIN WALL WHAT HIS EXPERIENCES OF THAT REUNIFICATION AND HOW THEY PERHAPS INFORMED HIS VIEWS ON BRICKS IT
WHEN GERMANY WAS REUNITED THIS TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRY
AND IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT THIS AND I THINK IT'S IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR A COUNTRY THAT
ITS INHABITANTS MANAGE CHOO COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR OWN
TENSIONS AND ANTAGONISMS AND I THINK THE REFERENDUM HAS SHOWN
AS MADE VISIBLE CERTAIN OF THESE AND TAG A BUSINESS AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT
YOU REACH COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU SHARE
WHY MAINTAINING WHAT UNITES US OR OTHER SMALLER SCALE WELL THERE HAS BEEN SOME DIS UNITY AROUND THE IDEA OF B.P. AS AN ARTS SPONSOR THEY'VE GOT A VERY BIG SPONSORSHIP WITH THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT
WELL UNSURPRISINGLY GIVEN THAT SORT OF TROUBLED TIMES HE'S HE WAS VERY KEEN TO KEEP P. AS AS A SPONSOR THEY GIVE HIM A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HE SAID THAT THE BRITISH MUSEUM IS FORTY PERCENT FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC BUT SIXTY PERCENT FUNDED BY ITS OWN ENTREPRENEURIAL EFFORTS WHICH MEANS IT'S FAIRLY HIGHLY GEARED FOR AN INSTITUTION LIKE THAT AND THEREFORE ALL MONEY IT CAN POSSIBLY GET IN IT WILL TAKE OBS IT'S GOT AN ETHICS COMMITTEE BUT HE SEEMS TO BE HAPPY
WITH B. P. I SUPPOSE THE OTHER BIG ETHICAL QUESTION HE'S GOING TO BE ASKED TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS THE ELGIN MARBLES DOES HE THINK THEY SHOULD GO BACK I ASKED HIM IF HE'D HEARD FROM THE GREEK AUTHORITIES YET AND I'VE GOT AN EMPHATIC NO AND THEN JUDGING BY WHAT DO YOU FOLLOW THAT UP WITH ARE THEY HEADING BACK TO GREECE I DON'T THINK SO
SIX POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE SEE THESE OBJECTS HERE ON SITE AND THEY NEST TELL SEE THESE OBJECTS THEY SEE THEM
IN RELATION TO OTHER GREAT CULTURES THERE ARE VERY VERY FEW MUSEUMS IN THE WORLD THAT COME OFF OF THIS ALL THIS IS
INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD CULTURE HE'S A VERY LEARNED AND ASSURED I FOUND A VERY GOOD COMPANY HE'S HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE COLLECTION IT IS GARGANTUAN THERE ARE MILLIONS OF OBJECTS BUT I DID ASK HIM WHICH ONE AT THIS STAGE HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE
THERE IS A SMALL OBJECT OR DATES FROM NINE THOUSAND B. C. IT'S TEN CENTIMETRES
IT'S MADE OF STONE IT COMES FROM
FIND SAINT CHRI OH WHICH IS PALESTINE YOU BETHLEM DAME TESSA
AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT'S THE FIRST SCULPTURE A REPRESENTATION OF CHOOSE HUMAN BEINGS MAKING LOVE AS MUCH
HOP IT FISHER THEY'RE TELLING IS HIS FAVOURITE TOO WILL GUMPERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HE WENT TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE WHY DO WE WATCH WAR FILMS WHAT DO THEY TELL US ABOUT OUR SENSE OF OURSELVES WHETHER THEY'RE ANTI WAR OR WHETHER THEY GLORIFIED WHAT'S IN A WAR FILM THE GENRE IS AS STRONG AS EVER AND IT'S BEING CELEBRATED BY A NEW EXHIBITION AT THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM IN LONDON TO MUSICIAN THERE GOES BEHIND THE SCENES OF SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS FILMS IN THE GENRE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO LAURA CLOUTING HOOSE IN HISTORIAN AND CURATOR OF REEL TO REEL A CENTURY OF WAR MOVIES
I THINK WHAT THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME FILM DEAD AS THAT IS THE FIRST TIME REALLY THAT THE IDEA OF A FEATURE FILM AWARD WAR DOCUMENTARY BECAME SOMETHING OF A SENSATION OF THE CINEMAS ARE NEW RELATIVELY NEW THING FILM IS NOT TERRIBLY OLD MEDIUM AND IT BECOMES THIS INCREDIBLY IMMEDIATE WAY TO UNDERSTAND TO VISUALISE WAR
THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME FILM WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE COME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE DOING DURING THIS BATTLE THIS BIG PITCH IN NINETEEN SIXTEEN MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A SHOCK TO THEM GIVEN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID ABOUT THE WAR AND IN THE MONTHS RUNNING UP TO ABOUT HOW IT WAS A GLORIOUS THING AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE WONDERFUL TIMES YEAH ABSOLUTELY THIS FILM THE TWENTY MILLION TIMES IN THE FIRST
LET'S TURN TO THE DAMBUSTERS WHICH IS A FILM FROM ALMOST EVERYONE WILL SAY NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE I KNOW
A MOOD THAT WAS TRIUMPHANT BUT TINGED WITH SOMETHING ELSE I SUPPOSE IT'S FAIR TO SAY AT LEAST TOWARDS THE END YEAH I THINK THE DAMBUSTERS IS PROBABLY THE MOST ICONIC OF THE FIFTIES WAR MOVIES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS YOU'VE HAD TO WORK WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR TARGET
OR EVEN YOUR WEAPON AND DELIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO HIT THE ENEMY
OR DESTRUCTIVELY THAN ANY SMALL FORCE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE
THESE KIND OF CLASSICS OF THAT PERIOD EVERYTHING FROM THE CRUEL SEA THE DAMBUSTERS ICE COLD IN ALEX AND THESE FILMS REALLY WERE THERE TO KIND OF CHICKEN TO TELL PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT THIS WAS WORTH IT BECAUSE TEN YEARS AFTER THE BOY THE LEGACY OF THAT CONFLICT STILL HAS NOT ABATED TIGHT THEY ALSO DOING IT IN A SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX WHEN YOU MENTION ICE COLD IN ALEX WHO IN WHICH THAT WHILE THERE'S A GERMAN CHARACTERS
GENTLY PORTRAYED AND THE HERO HAS ALL SORTS OF CRISES ALTHOUGH EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDS AS IT'S A MORE COMPLEX PICTURE YEAH AND THESE BRITISH HEROES NOT THE KIND OF TRIUMPHANT FIGURES FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN AMERICAN FILMS THERE THEY CAN HAVE THE IDEA OF THE ANTI HERO JOHN MILLS AND ICE COLD IN ALEX THE VERY RUGGED VERY TROUBLED CHARACTER HAS A DRINK PROBLEM VERY PRONE TO WILD OUTBURST OF ANGER THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC HERO BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION
YOU SHOULD WEAR THEM FOR AS GOOD AT SWIMMING FOR THIS BRING IT BANG UP TO DATE TOO MUCH CLOSER TO DATE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HURT LOCKER THE AMERICAN FILM
WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF KATH VICTORY THIS IS CANTERBURY OH NODDY CHANGED THEIR BURROW WEEK AGO VICTORY SOUND
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT
AND YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE HISTORY OF WAR FILMS WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHERE WE COME I REALLY THINK FILMS BUT MODERN CONFLICT TELL US SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING IN THAT REALLY IS THAT THERE IS A TOTAL LACK OF CONSENSUS ABOUT MODERN CONFLICTS YOU DO NOT GET THESE KIND OF EPICS IAN ABOUT THE VERY NATURE THAT THESE WARS ARE MUCH MORE THE MUCH SMALLER AND MUCH MORE FRAGMENTED
THE CAUSES OF THESE WARS ARE FAR MORE CONTENTIOUS THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THE SECOND EN BORE WHERE GENERALLY SPEAKING THE POPULATION WAS BEHIND THE WAR FELT THAT IT WAS WORTHWHILE SO WHAT I THINK YOU SEE WITH FILMS LIKE THE HURT LOCKER EVEN RIGHT BANG UP TO DATE WITH SOMETHING LIKE EYE IN THE SKY WHICH SPECTRE OWN WELFARE IS A MUCH SMALLER SCALE STORY YOU'RE SEEING THOSE CONFLICTS THROUGH THE PRISM OF AN INDIVIDUAL OR A VERY SMALL GROUP OF MEN AND DID THAT START WITH THE DAY
WE'RE BACK NOW ISN'T IT I'M SEVENTY EIGHT YEAH I THINK YOU COULD LOOK AT THOSE VIETNAM FILMS AS BEING AGAIN THESE ARE PRISONS THESE AREN'T VERY CAN OF SMALL SCALE STORIES IF YOU LIKE THAT ALLOWED YOU TO TAKE A VERY PERSONAL INDIVIDUAL IMPRESSION OF THAT CONFLICT BUT OF COURSE WITH FOR EXAMPLE TO VIETNAM FILMS THEY ARE PRIMARILY THE VISION THAT YOU CAN INSTANTLY CONDOR UP WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT WAS THAT CONFIT LIKE
THE IMPORTANCE OF WAR MOVIES AND I THINK WHY THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM WANTS A NEW EXHIBITION ABOUT THEM IS THAT REALLY THEY ARE ONE OF OUR CHIEF WAYS OF GAINING A VISUAL SENSE OF WHAT WAR IS LIKE WORKED OUT OF THANKS
IT IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THIS WAS THE WEEK WHEN WE UNDERSTOOD THE WISDOM OF THE OLDEST PERHAPS THE TIRED IS CLICHE IN BRITISH POLITICS HAROLD'S
WILSON'S OBSERVATION THAT A WEEK YOU KNOW THE REST BUT IN THE SPACE OF SEVEN DAYS WE WENT FROM BEING A COUNTRY IN THE E.U. LED BY DAVID CAMERA AT LEAST OF COURSE UNTIL BORIS JOHNSON TOOK OVER WHO WOULD FACE JEREMY CORBIN AS LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION TO A COUNTRY WHICH IS HEADING OUT OF THE E.U. SEARCHING FOR A NEW PRIME MINISTER WHO OF COURSE WHAT MAY NOT TO BE BORIS JOHNSON AND WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY AND THE MASS REVOLT DESIGNED TO FORCE MISTER CORBIN HELPED
WHAT MIGHT THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS THE NEXT SEVEN WEEKS THE NEXT SEVEN MONTHS PRODUCE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL OUR JULIA LANGDON POLITICAL JANICE JOIN THE LOBBY FORGIVE ME FOR REMINDING PEOPLE OF YOUR AGE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS PUT IN THE DAILY MIRROR AND THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH AND ANDREW LORNE'S NOT QUITE YET A VETERAN A GURU OF THE OBSERVER POLITICAL AND REPORTED YOU JULIA GOOD MORNING HELLO MOLLY BRIEFLY BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT NEXT CHEST CAPTURE IF YOU CAN RATHER BRIEFLY JULIE
HOW EXTRAORDINARY IS THIS HAS THERE EVER BEEN A WEEK LIKE THIS NO IT'S ALL I COULD SAY THAT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ASK ME WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT BECAUSE I WOULD BE A FOOL TO TRY TO FOCUS ANYTHING AFTER THE WEEK WE'VE HAD IT'S BEEN ASTONISHING ANDREW ANYTHING IN YOUR PAST IN THE PAST THAT HAS BEEN LIKE THIS
I LIKE JULIA LIKE YOURSELF NICK I'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME PRETTY ENORMOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS WHEN THERE WAS THE INVASION OF IRAQ THE FALL OF MARGARET THATCHER BLACK WEDNESDAY WHEN WE CRASHED OUT THE R. M. BUT IN TERMS OF A CONFLATION OF THE POLITICAL THE ECONOMIC
AND THE DIPLOMATIC CRISIS ALL COMING TOGETHER AND BOTH ARE MAJOR PART IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THE LABOUR PARTY BEING IN STATES OF ANARCHY
THERE'S BEEN NOTHING LIKE IT AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT THIS WEE WHERE BORIS JOHNSON GOES JULIA FOR BEING THE FRONT RUNNER TO BEING POLITICALLY DEAD AND NOW THE POSSIBILITY THE WOMAN HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE CABINET IS BEING TALKED UP ANDREA LEADS AND HAS SOMEONE HE COULD BE PRIME MINISTER WITHIN DAYS THEORETICALLY CERTAINLY WITHIN WEEKS A WOMAN WHO ISN'T EVEN A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN HER OWN HOUSEHOLD WE'RE TOLD YES IF IT IS REALLY REMARKABLE
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT THERESA MAY LOOKS LIKE SHE'S VERY WELL AHEAD WE WERE SAYING JUST NOW SHE MIGHT EVEN BE PRIME MINISTER BY THE END OF THE WEEK I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK GOATS GOING TO MAKE IT DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE ANDREW ON THE BASIS THAT THE OTHERS JUST FALL BY THE WAYSIDE AT THERESA MAY IS IN DOWNING STREET WITHIN DATE
COULD BE AND I THINK A REASON FOR THAT IS ALTHOUGH AS WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS SENSATIONALLY CHAOTIC PERIOD
IN THE END AND YOU'RE SEEING I THINK WITH THIS RAPID GRAVITATION TOWARDS MISSUS MAY PEOPLE YEARNING CERTAINLY IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOR A BIT MORE CERTAINTY INSTABILITY I THINK PROBABLY PEOPLE OUT IN THE COUNTRY MANY OF THEM ARE YEARNING FOR THAT TOO AS THEY TRY AND RUN THEIR BUSINESSES OR THING OF THINKING ABOUT THEIR JOB SECURITY AND I THINK ONE OF MISSUS MAY'S VERY STRONG CALLING CARDS HAS BEEN TO SAY LOOK I'M THE SERIOUS PERSON I MAY BE A BIT DULL YOU MAY SAY I'M NOT VERY CHARISMATIC I DON'T LIKE TO DO A GOSSIP I DON'T JOKE MUCH
BUT I'M A SERIOUS PERSON FOR THESE VERY SERIOUS TIMES AND I THINK A LOT OF A SUDDEN SHE ALWAYS HAD SOME SUPPORT BUT A LOT OF THESE EXTRA SUPPORT THAT'S VERY QUICKLY GRAVITATED TOWARDS IS A SORT OF REACTION AGAINST THE VERY CHAOTIC PERIOD WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH JULIA LANGDON THIS CRISIS IN THE LABOUR PARTY HAS BEEN BREWING OVER ALL THE DECADE YOU'VE BEEN COVERING BRITISH POLITICS HASN'T IT IT HAS THE LABOUR PARTY'S PROBLEM REALLY IS THAT UNLIKE OTHER
WESTERN EUROPE EUROPEAN LOVE A LEFT WING SOCIALIST PARTIES THEY NEVER ACTUALLY JUNKED THE FAR LEFT THEY DID THAT IN GERMANY IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE A BAD GOT A SPURT ON THEY DID IT IN FRANCE THEY GOT COMMS WENT OFF ON THEIR OWN AND COMMUNIST SORRY THE COMMON IT'S WENT OFF ON THEIR OWN IN THE SOCIALIST PARTY
BECAME THE MAIN MAIN LEFT WING PARTY IN FRENCH POLITICS WE'VE NEVER DONE THAT THE S.D.P. OF COURSE HAD A GO SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THEY DON'T WEIGH A SPLIT IS NEEDED A SPLIT BETWEEN THE MOMENTUM FORCES WE HEARD HIM HEARING OF EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME IT BACK CORBIN AND THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY WHO PREDOMINANTLY DON'T
WELL DONE ONE POINT THAT'S BEEN MADE TO BE BY SEVERAL MY LABOUR PARTY CONTACTS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IS THAT THERE'S NO REASON REALLY CRUSH IT CAN'T HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY PARTY LED BY PERSON AYE AND A PARTY IN THE COUNTRY THEY'RE BY PERSON B.
IN A WAY THAT LOOKS WET LIKE WHERE WE'RE GOING BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE IF CORBIN HE'S HE'S NOT GOING TO GO AND I THINK HE'S BEEN HELD IN POSITION TALKS HAVE BEEN HELD ABOUT THERE ANDREW IN PARLIAMENT HAVEN'T THEY ARE BETTER SEPARATE LEADER OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND TALKS TO ABOUT A BRAND NEW PARTY GET BACK TO THE OLD S.T.P. OF THE EARLY EIGHTIES
YES I MEAN THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SORT OF TWO LEADERS THING AS IT COULD BE COMPLETELY HYDRA HEADED AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP THIS WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BOSE'S I MEAN I AND OTHERS HAVE LONG ARGUED THAT ACTUALLY OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM CRAMS TRIES TO HAVE TWO BIGGER COALITIONS BASICALLY WITHIN ONE PARTY IN THE LABOUR PARTY IS REALLY AT LEAST TWO PARTIES AND SO BY THE WAY IS THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THEY SHOULD
PROBABLY BE BETTER OFF IN MANY WAYS AND OFFER CLEARER CHOICE TO THE ELECTORATE WERE BOTH TO SPLIT AND SO WE HAD A CHOICE OF FOUR OR FIVE PARTIES AS WERE YOU WOULD GET COMMONLY IN THE REST OF YOUR UP THE PROBLEM AS WE ALL KNOW IS OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM IN WHICH HER MERCILESSLY PUNISHES THAT JULIA A BRIEF LAST WORD IF YOU WOULD SHOULD PEOPLE HIDE UNDER THE DIVA IF THEY'RE STILL IN BED SHOULD THEY DESPAIR OVER THEIR CUP OF COFFEE OR COULD THIS BE A PERIOD OF GREAT CREATIVE DESTRUCTION
CREATIVE DESTRUCTION BOXES COBB DID I THINK THAT PROBABLY TERRIFIED HIM BACK UNDER THE DUVET DO IT YOU'RE NOT AN OPTIMIST AND AND NO I'M NOT
