PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOT JUST AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AT THERE IT'S ALMOST NECK AND NECK NINETEEN PERCENT FOR HER EIGHTEEN PERCENT FOR BORIS JOHNSON BUT CRITICALLY AMONGST TORY VOTERS THIRTY ONE PER CENT BACK HER TWENTY FOUR PER CENT
THAT BORIS JOHNSON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IS I REMEMBER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY WHEN JOHN MAJOR BECAME MORE POPULAR THAN MICHAEL HESELTINE AND SUDDENLY EMERGED AS THE MAN TO REPLACE MARGARET THATCHER
AND TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES IS LOOKING AT THE EFFECT ON THE MARKETS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS THE HEADLINE STERLING AND BANK STOCKS HAMMERED AS CAMERON SEEKS TO CALM MARKETS AS A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE COMMONS YES THEY WERE WANT THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE ECONOMIC LINKS WITH OUR EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PAPER PICKS UP ON
HOW MUCH FINANCIAL FALL OUT THERE HAS BEEN BATTERING GLOBAL SHARES AND STIRLING WITH THE PAPERS STORY IN THE FRONT PAGE ALSO SUGGESTING THAT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST HEDGE FUNDS MANY OF WHICH HAVE SAT ON THE SIDELINES UNTIL NOW I HAVE NOW MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO BET AGAINST THE POUND AND THOSE BRITISH STOCKS WHICH WOULD BE HIT IN A RECESSION
AND THE BACK PAGES OF COURSE ARE FULL OF HEADLINES ABOUT THE FOOTBALL GOD HELP US IS HOW THE STAR PUTS IT BRECK'S IT IS THE WAY THE MIRROR PUTS A CLUELESS IS THE DAILY EXPRESS ENGLAND'S GREATEST HUMILIATION SAYS THE TELEGRAPH ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN DOM'S GONE TO ICELAND A VERSION OF THE SUPERMARKETS LIKE HER MUM'S GONE TO ICELAND OF COURSE WITH A PICTURE OF WAYNE ROONEY SON KAI LOOKING DESPERATE OH DAD WHAT HAVE ROO DONE HE SAID
THAT IS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT A FOOTBALL FAN YOU MAY HAVE JUST MISSED THIS THE RANK OUTSIDERS ICELAND A COUNTRY THE SIZE OF THE CITY OF LEICESTER HAVE KNOCKED ENGLAND OUT OF THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT IN FRANCE WINNING BY TWO GOALS TO ONE THEY WILL NOW FACE THE HOST NATION IN PARIS NEXT SUNDAY AND HERE IS THE MOMENT THEY WANT
BUT MOST ARE PICKED HIM UP
YOU'RE ALWAYS AT MY THROAT
HERE CAUSED A DEGREE OF EXCITEMENT ON A SMALL ISLAND WHICH IS NEVER BEFORE QUALIFIED FOR A MAJOR FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT ICELAND'S CO COACH A DENTIST BY TRADE HI EMMA HOW GRIMSON SAID THE TEAM WHICH HE CALLS ICELAND'S ARMY HAD SEIZED THEIR OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WANT THE BEST OUT OF LIFE YOU HAVE TO BE READY WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY COMES
THAT IS A FACT AND THESE BOYS THEY WERE READY TODAY AND THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT
WAS PUT IN OUR HANDS WAS HUGE AND THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A DAY THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND ICELAND FANS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AS WELL OF COURSE THEY SPOKE OF THEIR JOY AFTER THE MATCH IN NICE
ABSOLUTELY NICE I CAN YOUR MAKE UP OR MAGGOTS TO ME
OH YOU KNOW THE VIKINGS ARE BACK IT'S ABOUT EIGHT OF THE VIKINGS SMALL NATIONS MENTALITY IS THERE PLUS MENTALITY
MEANWHILE ENGLAND FANS PRETENDED THEY HADN'T EXPECTED IT ALL ALONG AND SHARED THEIR DESPAIR
I SHOULD HAVE THE WORST EVER SEEN WITH THEM
I THINK FIRST THINGS FIRST CRAB EIGHT ICELAND THEY DEFEND
A BAD WEEK FOR BRITAIN BUG WEEK FOR THE U.K. COST US A FORTUNE
THEN HE GOES HE DOES FORM A LIKE THAT WAS SHOCKING
AND DAD'S WELL THIS DAD ANYWAY TOLD THEIR SONS PREPARE FOR ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR DECADES LIKE THIS
IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX HOW DAVID CAMERON WILL BE MEETING EUROPEAN LEADERS LATER TODAY BEFORE THEY ASK HIM TO LEAVE THE ROOM SO THEY CAN HAVE PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BRECHT'S IT CHRIS MORRIS IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS WE KNOW BECAUSE ARTICLE FIFTY HAS NOT BEEN TRIGGERED THAT THIS THERE CANNOT BE THEY THE E.U. SUGGEST EVEN INFORMAL TALKS ON WHAT OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. COULD LOOK LIKE SO WHAT IS IT THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED TODAY
I THINK FROM THE PRIME MINISTER'S PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF ITS ERRORS CAN BE ABOUT TONY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A CONSTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST COMFORTABLE OF DAYS IS IT HIS FIRST MEETING BEFORE THE COUNCIL ITSELF BEGINS AS WITH JEAN CLAUDE YOUNG COOK THE COMMISSION PRESIDENT REMEMBER HOW HARD TWO YEARS AGO DAVID CAMERON FOUGHT TO STOP HIM GETTING THE JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE WELL NOW HE'S GOING TO OUTLAST THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
AND I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND THE TABLE THINKING YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON YOURSELF SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE FORMAL OR INFORMAL DISCUSSION OF THE PROCESS OF DIVORCE BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE A GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT
ABOUT HOW BRITAIN UNTIL IT LEAVES IS STILL A FULL MEMBER OF THE E.U. THAT'S NUMBER ONE IT HAS BOTH RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ALSO I THINK AN APPEAL FROM THE PRIME MINISTER SAY TO THE REST LOOK THIS HAS HAPPENED IT WASN'T THE OUTCOME I WANTED OR EXPECTED BUT NICK WE NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AND AS CONSTRUCTIVE AWAY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE HAVE THIS RATHER BIZARRE SITUATION OF HAVE WITH THEIR OF THE PRIME MINISTER BEING ASKED TO LEAVE THE ROOM DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'RE KEEPING TOLD NOTHING'S CHANGED UNTIL WE TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY
YEAH THAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW WE OFTEN TEND TO THINK PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO NOW THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT US IT ISN'T THE REST WANT TO CONTAIN THE DAMAGE THEY WANT TO RALLY THE TWENTY SEVEN WHO REMAIN AND LET'S NOT FORGET THIS IS PRETTY X. STENCIL FOR THE Y. YOU AS A WHOLE NOT JUST FOR THE U.K. THE SPECTRE OF A BREAK UP IS HAUNTING EUROPE THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE OF THE COUNCIL PRESIDENT DONALD CLOSE JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THERE'S CONCERN
ABOUT THE EFFECT OF BRECHT'S IT ON THE EURO AS WELL AS ON STERLING FEARS ABOUT THE EUROZONE CRISIS RE EMERGING AS A RESULT AND ALL OF THESE ARE REASONS YES TO TRY AND DO THIS ISN'T INCOMES AS CONSTRUCTIVE AWAY AS POSSIBLE BUT ALSO TO GET ON WITH IT I THINK THERE IS A FEELING YES CLEARLY GIVEN THE TURMOIL IN BRITISH POLITICS AT THE MOMENT THE U.K. NEEDS A LITTLE TIME TO SORT OUT IT'S NEGOTIATING HOUSE BUT ONCE THAT'S DONE LET'S GET ON WITH IT LET'S DO IT CHRIS MORRIS THANK YOU
IT IS A QUARTER PAST SIX THE BANKS ARE IN FREEFALL CREDIT RATINGS ARE BEING SLASHED ENGLAND A DREADFUL AGAIN IN THE FOOTBALL IS THIS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MAN WHO KNOWS HERE WITH ALL THE BUSINESS NEWS THIS MORNING DOMINIC EH COME ON YES THERE IT DOES IT DOES RATHER HAVE A CRISIS FEEL ABOUT IT WE HAD TO DOWNGRADE BRITAIN'S CREDIT RATING WE'RE NO LONGER PART OF THE TRIPLE A. CLUB
THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED FELL OF THE TWO AND A HALF PER CENT IN THE FOOTIE T. FIFTY ANOTHER SEVEN PER CENT AND IT'S ALL A BIT GRIZZLY BUT THE REAL DAMAGE WAS AMONG THE BIG BANKS YESTERDAY BARCLAYS WAS DOWN SEVENTEEN PERCENT ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND FELL FIFTEEN PER CENT AND LLOYD'S NINE PER SINCE SINCE THURSDAY THE DAY OF THE VOTE THEY SHARES A OF ALL THESE BIG BANKS ARE DOWN ABOUT A THIRD
THEY NEVER FILL THIS FASTEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DURING THE BANKING CRISIS TO FIND SOMETHING SIMILAR WE HAVE TO GO BACK THIRTY YEARS NEARLY THIRTY YEARS TO BLACK MONDAY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN ALL WORLD STOCK MARKETS CRASHED SO HOW BAD IS I'M JOINED BY HUGH BEN SEEMS BAKING AND MISTER MORGAN STEM
WHY ARE THE BANKS THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE FOR THIS FOR THIS BRICKS AT THE FAIR DON'T YOU I THINK THIS TWO CONCERNS REALLY ABOUT HOW BIG A HIT THIS WILL BE TO BANK PROFITABILITY AND ALSO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT NEXT THE TRIPLE WHAMMY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BANKS FIRST WILL THEY DO LESS BUSINESS AS BUSINESSES PUT OFF INVESTMENTS OR PEOPLE TAKE UP FEW MORTGAGES AND SECOND WILL THEY MAKE LESS MONEY ON THEIR LOANS IF THE BANK OF ENGLAND WERE TO CUT INTEREST RATES AND PROLONG THIS PERIOD OF PROFOUNDLY LOWER RATES AND CERTAINLY I'LL GO BAD THAT'S ME HIYA
BEFORE PER IT WE THOUGHT THE U.K. BANKS EARNINGS MAY FALL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT AS YOU SAID A BARCLAYS R.B.S. LLOYDS NEARER THIRTY PER CENT I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THIS THIS UNCERTAINTY WHAT ELSE COULD GO WRONG AND TO EXTENT THE POLITICIANS COULDN'T PLACE A SOLUTION WILL COME BACK FROM THERE BUT THIS THIS UNCERTAINTY
AND THE BIG QUESTION IS ARE THESE BANKS SAFE WE LOOK I THINK THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND AS YOU REMEMBER WHEN I'M BETWEEN TO ROBERT AT THE TIME I WAS VERY I WAS VERY VERY BEST ABOUT THE BANKS AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHAT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME WAS THREE THINGS THE BANKS HAVE GOT A TON MORE CAPITAL ON AVERAGE THE U.K. DOMESTIC BANKS HAVE GOT TRIPLED THEIR CAPITAL RATIOS ARE MUCH TOUGHER STANDARDS I THINK SECOND THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM LOST TIME WAS RUN ON FUNDING
THE MANX OF REDUCE THEIR FUNDING NEEDS DRAMATICALLY TAKE THEIR FUNNY NEED TO DOWN NINETY FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME THEY SCORED AWAY NINE TIMES THAT THEIR NEEDS IN FUNDING AND THIRDLY
THE BANKS WERE READY THE BANKS AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO BE COMMENDED FOR DOING MONTHS AND MONTHS OF STRESS TESTING SO THIS IS MUCH MORE FEAR OF WHAT NEXT AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE PREPARED TO ADAPT SO SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE BANKS COLLAPSING AT LEAST NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT WE ARE ALL BIZARRELY WORSE OFFERS A LOT OF US BECAUSE WE'RE ALL SHAREHOLDERS AND ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND ITS LOSS EIGHT BILLION POUNDS OF STOCK MARKET VALUE OF THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS THAT MEANS EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POUNDS WORSE OFF
I WOULD LIKE IT I THINK THIS IS TRUE ALSO ACROSS THE CONSTANT ALSO SOME ITALIAN AND GREEK BANKS ARE THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT TOO I THINK THIS IS A DOWNDRAUGHT FOR EVERYONE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK AS I SAID THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE BANKS ON A MUCH MORE STABLE POSITION THE CONCERNS IS HOW QUICKLY WE CAN PUT IN PLACE A SOLUTION WHICH CAN GIVE THE CONFIDENCE COS REALLY THE BANKS ARE A MIRROR OF THE ECONOMY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT IT SIR IT'S HARD TO FEEL TOO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR A BANK CHIEF EXECUTIVE BUT
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THESE COMPANIES IT AS ONE DAMN THING AFTER ANOTHER ISN'T IT THEY HAD THE BANKING CRISIS BEEN ALLSORTS OF REGULATION NOW THIS AND OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT WORSE NEWS TO COME PARTICULARLY BARCLAYS THEY FACE BIG SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA DON'T THEY
I THINK THE CONTINUE NEEDED FOR BANKED CHIEF EXECUTIVES TO ADAPT WETHERBY TECHNOLOGY WILL BE REGULATION WILL BE ECONOMIC SHOPS THE BACK THEIR BUSINESS OR BANKING IS TO CONTINUE TO ADAPT I THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME DIFFICULTIES AHEAD PARTICULARLY LITIGATION WHERE WE WERE UNFORTUNATE ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE LITIGATION FOR BOBBIE'S KNOB YES OR JUST SHOT UP BY THE POUND FALLING SO YOU CAN TELL IT IS UNFORTUNATE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU VENT STEAM IT'S BAKING ANALYST MORGAN STANLEY I'M JOINED NOW BY JANE FOLEY A MARKET SCARCE THE SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT RUBBER BANK JANE THIS CUP TO THE CREDIT RATING WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN THE REAL WORLD THAT WE LOSE THIS
ONE GO FROM TRIPLE A. DOWN TO DOUBLE A. WELL I SUPPOSE IF WE LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE TEXTBOOK DEFINITION IS IN SIMPLISTIC TURNS IT IT REALLY IS A VIEW ON HOW LIKELY AT THE COUNTRY IS TO MAKE ITS INTEREST PAYMENTS OR TO DEFAULT SO FOR INSTANCE IF WE DO GET THE CREDIT RATING WHICH OF COURSE WE HAVE WE'VE GOT THAT IS A NEGATIVE PIECE OF NEWS
THAT SAID OF COURSE THE MARKET WAS NOT SURPRISED BY THIS IT'S AND IT'S ANTICIPATING NET FITCH VINCENT'S WARNED OF AN ABRUPT SLOW DOWN INDEED PINNACLES MANY ECONOMISTS BEEN WARNING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME IT'S GOT TO BE SAID THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN SLOWING FOR SOME TIME NOT ALL OF THIS CAN BE BLAMED ON BREAD SEPARATE AT ONCE IT WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES WERE TO SUFFER AND BAND AND IT COULD AFFECT THEIR COST A CAPITAL NOW
BECAUSE A SUFFERIN DOWNGRADE IS A VIEW ON HOW LUCKY AT ARE COUNTRIES TO DEFAULT YOU CAN IN A TEXTBOOK SITUATION EXPECT INTEREST RATES GOOD TO GO WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT MAYBE BUNGEE EELS TO GO UP AND THE COST OF A BURROW DESK THAT'S NOT HAPPEN THE OPPOSITE WILL HAPPEN ABSOLUTELY AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN A TEXTBOOK SITUATION WHERE IN THE REAL WORLD
AND RIGHT NOW OF COURSE WHAT WAS SEEN AS INVESTORS MOVING AWAY FROM RISKY ASSETS SUCH AS STOCKS ARE MOVING INTO THE SAFETY OF PONDS AND OF COURSE THAT IS COUNTERING OR MORE THAN COUNTERING THE IMPACT OF THIS CREDIT RATING TO LET'S GO BACK OVER THAT AGAIN WE LOSE THE TRIPLE A. CREDIT RATING IN HER IN A ROOM IN THERE
REAL WORLD WILL NOT A IN A PROPER WORLD DID THE U.K.'S BORING COS YOU GO UP AND HAVE ACTUALLY GONE DOWN CORRECT AND THAT IS AGAIN BECAUSE BONDS ARE OUR SAFE HAVEN INVESTMENT AT PENSION FUNDS EXCEPT ARE MORE LIKELY TO HOLD BONDS MOVING AWAY FROM RISKY INVESTMENTS SUCH AS STOCKS WILL PROPERTY
SO WHY SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT THE THE TRIPLE A. RATING AT ALL HAVE EVERYTHING STILL SERVING ALONG FINE OF THE U.K. CAN FUND ITSELF BINNED THEM WHO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD WE JUST IGNORE THIS ALTOGETHER WELL FOR SOME INVESTORS IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO FOR INSTANCE ESSEN P. PRINCESS WE WERE STILL TRIPLE EIGHT NOW FOR SOME INVESTORS AS LONG AS IT WAS WON AT THE CREDIT RATING AGENCY WHICH HAS THAT TOP NOTCH
THEY COULD STILL INVESTS ON THE MARGIN THERE WILL BE SOME INVESTORS THAT MAY NOT HAVE IN THE U.K. GOVERNMENT COMES TO BORROW MONEY THERE'LL BE SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN'T PARTICIPATE YOU CAN'T MEAN YOU CAME UP OR WE'LL SET YES ALL SET TO BE LESS INCLINED TO ALL BE ABLE TO PUT LESS U.K. INVESTMENT INTO THEIR PORCELAIN SO IT'S KIND OF AN EARLY WARNING INDICATOR INDEED IT IS BUT AGAIN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS ON THE CARD SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW NOT EXACTLY A SHOCK BUT IT IS ONE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF CREDIT RATING SAID THEY ARE A WARNING
JAYNE YOUR SPECIALIST SUBJECT WHERE THERE'S A POUND GO FROM HERE AT STRENGTHENED A LITTLE BIT ASIAN MARKETS OVERNIGHT A LITTLE BIT OF A CURRY OVERNIGHT IN AND PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE RISK APPETITE RECOVERED A LITTLE BIT THEY WERE SOME STIMULUS AND SOUTH KOREA EXCEPT HER AND MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING TO PANTED TO STIMULATE FISCALLY TOO BUT AGAIN I THINK IF WE LOOK AT WHAT EFFECTS CURRENCIES MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THEN THAT IS UNCERTAINTY AND RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT U.K. POLITICS ALONE AN ENORMOUS FOG OF UNCERTAINTIES DESCENDED WE HAVE AND SEVENTY WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SAID AND SEVENTY WITH RESPECT TO THE
THE OPPOSITION AND BEYOND THAT WE'VE GOT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PACE AND THE PROGRAMME WITH RESPECT TO OUR DIVORCE FROM THE E.U. SAID GIVEN ALL OF THAT I THINK STERLING REMAINS REALLY WITH FACE WITH HUGE DOWNSIDE RISK
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WITH HER DURING THE EURO CRISIS WASN'T MARKETS PRICE FOR POLITICS AS MUCH AS FINANCE ABSOLUTELY POLITICS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE AN INVESTOR YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE THE INWARD INVESTOR ARE YOU MORE LIKELY NOW TO INVEST IN THE U.K. GIVEN THAT CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY OR NOT AND THAT'S THE PANDAS IS REACTING TO THAT THANK YOU MUCH JANE FOLEY FROM RUB BACK ONE COME FROM REFRAIN FROM BUSINESS AS AT THE UNCERTAINTY WON'T GO AWAY UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT OUR TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPE WILL BE
IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME IMPORTANT GERMAN INDUSTRIALISTS HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND THERE'LL BE NO FREE ACCESS FOR THE U.K. UNLESS WE PAY OUR WAY HERE'S WHAT MATERIAL THIS MA'AM THE PRISON TO THE GERMAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HAD TO SAY
THAT COMES NECESSARILY WITH THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THAT'S THE BIG DEPLORE THE PRESS IN TEARS HAVE TO ACCEPT
JOINING HER FROM BRUSSELS TO DISCUSS THE TRADE SITUATION IS AMBASSADOR HUGO PAYMENT HE WAS THAT LEAD TRADE NEGOTIATOR FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NOW ADVISES THE LAW FIRM HOGAN LOVELL'S AMBASSADOR PAYMENT ONE OF THE MIC STEPS HOW DOES THE U.K. GO ABOUT SECURING THE STRAIGHT DEAL
WHILE IT'S ON IN THE TRADE AND IT ALL SITS IN THE BASIC LAWS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TOURISM PARTICLE AND TREATED EARTH SAYS HOW YOU HAVE TO ORGANISE THE PROCEDURE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND IT'S THE INITIATIVE THIS WITH THE U.K. GOVERNMENT NOW YOUR PRIME MINISTER HAS DECIDED THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE HAPPEN IT NOT HAPPENED BEFORE AND IT'S A NEW GOVERNMENT BELIEVE PEACE A NEW PRIME MINISTER
SO WE ARE IN FOR A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY I AM AFRAID BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER WHEN THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL BE IN PLACE AND LET'S HOPE THINGS HAVE SOMEWHAT SETTLED DOWN
THE PRO BRICKS AT CAMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE HAD TALKED ABOUT US HAVING THIS THIS THIS SITUATION WE'RE UNDER W. WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION RULES WE COULD HAVE A VERY SIMPLE AGREEMENT WHERE THERE WERE NO TERRACE NO TRADE BARRIERS WE'D STARE ME IN THE SINGLE MARKET AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE HELP HOW LIKELY IS THAT
FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE AS YOU SAID IT'S NOT DEPT WHEN YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE W.T.O. YOU HAVE NO BEARING HIS SNOUT TERRY THAT SEPARATE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN TRAIT REGIME MEANT THAT YOU HAVE TO LAY DOWN IN GENEVA HAD TO W. CURE AND WE HAVE TO BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY AND IF THERE'S NO AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE O.K. THAT'S PROBABLY THE REGIME THAT IS WHO I WOULD SAY BY DEFAULT
BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO HOLD SO OR HAVE YOU HAD A MEMBER OF THE W.T.O. AGREE WITH YOUR REGIME
IT'S A QUESTION OF GIVE AND TAKE AND THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF NEGOTIATION TO BE DONE BETWEEN YES FROM THE U.K. SIDE WITH ABOUT AND IT'S NOW A SECT SIXTY MEMBERS OF THE W.T.O. UP SO THIS IS INTERNATIONALLY THIS WILL BE A HUGELY
TIME CONSUMING BUSINESS STAYING JUST WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THOUGH HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK BRITAIN COULD COME TO A DEAL
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS WHEN IT STARTS HAD BECAUSE ONCE IT STARTS IT'S FOOT SHEEN IN THE TREATY SAID IT'S YES TO HAPPEN WITHIN TWO YEARS
CAN BE EXTENDED BUT YOU NEED UNANIMITY ABIDA I AM OF STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SO COULD BE A PROBLEM BUT LET'S SAY IT NORMALLY IT HAS TO BE DONE IN TWO YEARS STARTING FROM THE MOMENT THE O.K.
REGISTERS HITS HER DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH I SAID WOULD PROBABLY ONLY HAPPEN IN OCTOBER AT LEAST TWO YEARS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMBASSADOR HUGO PAYMENT ADVISOR TO HOGAN MARBLES

VOLKSWAGEN HAS REPORTEDLY AGREED TO PAY THE EQUIVALENT OF MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND SETTLE CLAIMS MADE FOLLOWING THE COMPANY'S ADMISSION THAT HE'D CHEATED ON DIESEL CAR EMISSIONS TESTS MOST OF THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT BUYING BACK NEARLY HALF A MILLION VEHICLES OR REPAIRING THEM SO THAT THEY'RE COMPLIANT WITH AIR QUALITY LAWS
A BRITISH MAN ACCUSED IN THE UNITED STATES OF HACKING INTO GOVERNMENT COMPUTERS FACES AN EXTRADITION HEARING THIS MORNING LARRY LOVE WHO'S THIRTY ONE AND FROM SUFFOLK HAS DEPRESSION HIS FATHER SAID HE FEARS HIS SON WILL KILL HIMSELF IF HE SENT ABROAD FOR TRIAL
THANK YOU NEIL IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW ON ANY OTHER DAY THE SITE OF THE LABOUR LEADER RALLYING THOUSANDS OF HIS SUPPORTERS OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT AFTER MORE THAN HALF HIS SHADOW CABINET HAD QUIT INSIDE WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY AS IT IS IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY FOR NORMAN SMITH OR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR TO GET HIS TEETH INTO MORNING TO YOU NORMAN
I HESITATE TO PUT IT THIS WAY BUT YOU CAN'T SURVIVE THIS SORT OF THING CAN YOU BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE RULES OF POLITICS KEEP TELLING US THAT THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN DO
JEREMY CORBIN IS ADAMANT HE IS NOT GOING AND HAVING STUCK IT OUT SO FAR WITH WHAT TWO THIRDS OF HIS SHADOW CABINET GOING AND MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY LAST NIGHT WHERE HE FACED WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE OF CRITICISM AND ACTUALLY NOT FROM JUST THE USUAL SUSPECTS BUT REALLY FROM
ACROSS THE PARTY AND ALMOST IN SOME WAYS MORE IN SORROW THAN ANGER PEOPLE APPEALING PLEADING SAYING YOU'RE A DECENT MAN YOU'RE A GOOD MAN BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT UP TO THE JOB
AND DESPITE ALL THAT MISTER CORBIN'S ALLIES INSIST THIS IS QUOTES A CORRIDOR QUEUE SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW AS THERE WILL BE A VOTE OF M.P.S ON A NO CONFIDENCE MOTION I EXPECT THAT TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY CARRIED THE RESULTS WILL BE PUT TO MISTER CORBIN AGAIN HE WILL BE ASKED TO GO IF HE DOESN'T THERE WILL BE FURTHER RESIGNATIONS THE PERSON TO WATCH I THINK IS PROBABLY THE CHIEF WHIP ROSIE WINTERTON
AND THERE IS A VIEW THAT BASICALLY THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WILL BECOME UNMANAGEABLE THEY DO THEY THE REBELS HAVE A PLAN B. IN OTHER WORDS IF HE DOES STICK IT OUT TO THEY KNOW WHO WHO FROM A SELECTION OF TWO OR THREE THEY MIGHT YES I THINK THEY DO THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE ONE CANDIDATE SO THEY BASICALLY TOLD PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR EGOS TO ONE SIDE I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE ANGELA EAGLE
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER NAMES IN THE FRAME DOWN JARVIS OWN SMITH LEAVES AND ANDY TOM WATSON BUT I SUSPECT IT WILL BE ANGELA EAGLE THERE WILL BE A CONTEST WHICH THE MINISTERS ARE CONFIDENT OF WINNING BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY HAVE THE BACKING OF PARTY MEMBERS AND THE UNIONS ARE BIG UNIONS HAVE COME OUT IN MY FAVOUR I THINK IT WILL BE AN AWFUL LOT CLOSER THAN PERHAPS HE REALISES WHY BECAUSE M.P.S SAY THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT AT GRASS ROOTS LEVELS WITH MANY ORDINARY MEMBERS MANY OF THEM WHO SUPPORT MISTER CORBIN JUST IN DESPAIR AT HIS LACK OF
LEADERSHIP AND HIS PERFORMANCE DURING THE REFERENDUM THE UNIONS YES THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVES MADE BACK MISTER CORBIN BUT THEY SAY ONCE YOU CONSULT THE BROADER MEMBERSHIP IT MAY BE VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND ONE LAST THING THE THREE POUNDERS WHO SWUNG IT FOR MISTER CORBIN LAST TIME THERE IS A VIEW THIS TIME TO THE PEOPLE JOINING UP WILL BE ORDINARY LABOUR SUPPORTERS DESPERATE TO GET SHOT OF MYSTICAL WHEN I SQUEEZE IN OR THOUGHT ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE A PRIME MINISTER IN NINE WEEKS' TIME WELL WE HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY LONG LIST OF RUNNERS AND RIDERS I COUNTED SEVEN AT THE LAST
COUNT BASICALLY I SUSPECT IT'LL COME DOWN TO A TUSSLE BETWEEN THERESA MAY AND BORIS JOHNSON ONE WOULD IMAGINE BORIS JOHNSON AS POLE POSITION BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT DOES SEEM TO BE A DEGREE OF MOMENTUM BUILDING UP BEHIND THERESA MAY AS THE PERSON WHO COULD CUT A DEAL WITH EUROPE WHO COULD GO TOE TO TOE WITH ANGELA MERKEL AND THERE IS
A LOT OF RESENTMENT OF BORIS JOHNSON AND HIS ROLE IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN SO I DO NOT THINK IT IS A GIVEN THAT MY JOHNSON WILL NATURALLY SUCCEED NORMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED JEREMY HUNT'S ARGUING FOR A SECOND E.U. REFERENDUM LULU'S MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER BIG JOB IN HIM WE'LL BE TALKING TO HIM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN H. S. TWO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE MAY HAVE TO BE DELAYED TO CUT COSTS THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE RICHARD WESTCOTT IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD DELAYED BY HOW LONG
POTENTIALLY UP TO WHAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE IS THEY'VE ASKED H. S. TWO LIMITED TO GO AWAY AND LOOK AT WHAT THE EFFECTS MIGHT BE IF THEY ORIGINALLY THE FIRST PART IS DUE TO OPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX IF THEY WENT UP TO A YEAR BEYOND THAT WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY SAVE SOME MONEY IN DOING THAT SO IT'S NOT DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN THEY'RE HITTING SOME TIME TABLES THEY'RE MISSING OTHERS TIMETABLES
OVERALL THE REFLECTIVELY SAYING LIKE THEY OFTEN DO WITH THESE SORT OF HUGE PROJECTS THAT WAS FRANKLY IT'S OVERSPENT AT THE MOMENT AND IT'S WIRING OFF TARGET LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THEM HITTING DEADLINES BUT POTENTIALLY WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT GETTING ON ONE OF THESE HIGH SPEED TRAINS IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TO BIRMINGHAM FROM LONDON OR TO LONDON FROM BIRMINGHAM RATHER THAN TWENTY TWENTY SIX WHAT IS THE OVERSPEND AT THE MOMENT
FOR THE FIRST IT'S INTO FRASER'S HAVE THE FIRST FACE WHICH IS A LOT FURTHER DOWN THE LINE THE ROOTS ALL SECURED THE BILL IS GOING THROUGH PARLIAMENT M.P.S ARE ABOUT TO VOTE ON IT FOR THE FINAL TIME IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS ABOUT THAT BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE IN THE BAG FOR THEM IN TERMS OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST THE SAME AT THE MOMENT THAT SUCCEEDED BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FOUR MILLION POUNDS BECAUSE
THEY KEEP SORT OF CHANGING WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH THE STATIONS AND VIADUCTS AND THAT KIND OF THING AND IT ALL CHANGES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'VE GOT SO THAT'S THAT'S O.K. PROBABLY THEY CAN FIND THOSE SAVINGS THERE'S ALSO THE ASKING THEM TO POINT SEVEN BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF SAVINGS ON THE SECOND PARTS WHICH WOULD GO FROM BIRMINGHAM TO MANCHESTER AND LEEDS THEY HAVEN'T EVEN PUBLISHED THE ROUTE FOR THAT YET SO THEY SAY THEY FOUND THOSE EVENINGS
I SUSPECT WHAT WILL SEE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS IS THINGS LIKE SHEFFIELD STATION FOR EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO BUILD OUT OF TOWN A BRAND NEW STATION I SUSPECT THAT THE BILL WILL LOOK AT PUTTING SOME KIND OF SPUR OR SOMETHING INTO SHEFFIELD TO GO INTO THE CITY CENTRE SO EFFECTIVELY IT'S NOT A BRAND NEW STATION THAT COULD SAVE YOU THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION POUNDS SO WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE KINDS OF BIG CHANGES IN THE SECOND PART A BIT WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT A BILL FOR THAT
DOES BRECK'S IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE WHOLE PROJECT
THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE VOTE IT'S NOT MENTIONED IN ANY WAY AND WHEN I SPOKE TO THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE HASN'T BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SO I GUESS THE ANSWER AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T KNOW THE GOVERNMENT ARE VERY VERY KEEN TO SAY THOUGH NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER WE'RE GOING TO GET SPEECH IS BASICALLY SAYING THE RAILWAY FUNDING THE ROADS FUNDING IT'S ALL IN PLACE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT
BUT I GUESS WHO KNOWS WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH A NEW LEADER COMES IN WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY FIFTY SIX BILLION POUNDS AT THE MOMENT AND THAT'S JUST BY TWENTY FIFTEEN PRICES SO PEOPLE ARE STILL SORT OF HOLDING THEIR BREATH A BIT REALLY BUT AS I SAY THE M.P.S VOTE IN A COUPLE MONTHS TIME THEY'RE HOPING IT'S GOING TO GET ROYAL ASSENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST PART AND ONCE IT DOES
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IN THE BAG THAT IS PLANNING PERMISSION THAT IS LEGAL PERMISSION TO GO AND BUILD THE THING SO SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'LL HAPPEN QUITE SOON RICHARD WESKIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN A BRITISH COMPUTER HACKER FACES AN EXTRADITION HEARING THIS MORNING HAVING HACKED U.S. FEDERAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS HIS FATHER FEARS THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIMSELF IF HE SENT TO AN AMERICAN PRISON OR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD CAN TELL US MORE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THIS YOUNG MAN
YES I'M LARRY LOVES BEEN DESCRIBED IS AS BRILLIANT WITH COMPUTERS HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT A FANTASTIC MIND WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH COMPUTERS NEVER SINCE CHILDHOOD HAS BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH SORT OF HACKING INTO COMPUTER GAMES AND SO ON BUT HIS ISSUE IS THAT HE'S GOT FAIRLY SEVERE I SUPPOSE YOU'VE SINCE SYNDROME AND RECURRENT DEPRESSION
AND HE'S A FATHER AND HIS LAWYERS ARGUED THAT IF HE ENDS UP IN A PRISON IN AMERICA AWAITING TRIAL HE HAS A VERY VERY HIGH RISK OF SUICIDE AND PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE FIT TO STAND TRIAL
IN THE UNITED STATES THEY'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE DISPROPORTIONATE SENTENCE THAT HE MIGHT GET THERE IN AMERICA HE COULD GET TEN TWENTY YEARS OR EVEN ARREST OF LIFE SENTENCE FOR THE CRIMES HE'S ACCUSED OF COMMITTING AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE PUT ON TRIAL HERE THE OFFENCES WERE COMMITTED ALLEGEDLY FROM HIS PARENTS' HOME IN SUFFOLK
AND THEY DON'T SEE WHY HE SHOULD BE SENT TO AMERICA TO STAND TRIAL FOR WHAT A FAIRLY SERIOUS CHARGES WHEN HE COULD STAND TRIAL FOR THOSE SAME CHARGES IN THE U.K. WITH A MUCH BETTER EFFECT ON HIS MENTAL HEALTH WHAT ARE HIS CHANCES OF AVOIDING THIS EXTRADITION
IF YOU THINK OF THE VERY HIGH PROFILE CASE OF GARY MCKINNON WHICH EVENTUALLY THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY STOPPED THEN THERE'S GOT TO BE A CHANCE IN FACT AFTER THE GARY MCKINNON CASE THERE WAS A NEW RULE INTRODUCED CALLED THE FORUM BAR IN WHICH COURTS HERE IN THE U.K. COULD SAY THAT IF THE CASE COULD BE TRIED HERE IN BRITAIN THAN IT SHOULD BE TRIED HERE IN BRITAIN RATHER THAN OVERSEAS I MEAN THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THE ORGANISATIONS THAT LARRY LOVES ALLEGED TO HAVE HACKED INTO INCLUDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE THE F.B.I. BY THE U.S. ARMY THE MISSILE DEFENCE AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE NASSER I MEAN HE'S A VERY VERY BIG U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND CLEARLY THE AMERICANS WANT TO MAKE A POINT BY PUTTING HIM ON TRIAL AND SO HIS LAWYERS ARGUED WELL THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD ALSO BE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION
THEN A SIMPLE THANK YOU WILL BE TALKING TO HIS FATHER LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS WHERE BRECK'S IT TAKES SECOND PLACE ON THE FRONT PAGES TO THE CRISES AT THE TOP OF THE TWO MAIN PARTIES AT WESTMINSTER GO NOW THE LABOUR FRIENDLY DAILY MIRROR TELLS JEREMY CORBIN FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PARTY AND FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY DAILY MAIL TALKS OF LABOUR TEARING ITSELF APART
OTHER FRONT PAGES FOCUS ON THE TORY SUCCESSION THE TIMES DECLARES THAT THERESA MAY IS THE FAVOURITE TO REPLACE DAVID CAMERON AFTER A SURGE OF SUPPORT AMONG CONSERVATIVE VOTERS THE EYE DOESN'T GO QUITE SO FAR CALLING HER THE FAVOURITE TO BECOME THE STOP BORIS CANDIDATE EXPRESSED THINKS BORIS JOHNSON IS THE MOST POPULAR CANDIDATE AND SAID HE'S OFFERED THERESA MAY OR TOP CABINET JOB IN A BID TO TURN THEIR TORY RACE INTO A CORONATION IN AN ARTICLE FOR THE TIMES THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE RULES HIMSELF OUT SAYING
HE'S NOT THE MAN WHO CAN PROVIDE THE UNITY OF THE PARTY NEEDS ACCORDING TO THE SUN HE'S TOLD FRIENDS HE WON'T TAKE SIDES IN THE CONTEST UNTIL CANDIDATES PLEDGED TO KEEP FIRM ECONOMIC LINKS WITH THE E.U. ARE CALLED BY THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT FOR A SECOND E.U. REFERENDUM IS THE LEAD IN THE TELEGRAPH IN AN ARTICLE FOR THE PAPER MY DOG IS THAT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER MUST BE ALLOWED TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH BRUSSELS AND PUT IT TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE
EITHER BY CALLING A GENERAL ELECTION OR HAVING ANOTHER REFERENDUM BRITAIN MUST REMAIN IN THE SINGLE MARKET HE SAYS AND NEEDS TO REACH A SENSIBLE COMPROMISE WITH THE E.U. OVER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT TO ALLOW THE U.K. TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION
LIBBY PURVES USES A COLUMN IN THE SUN TO POUR SCORN ON THE RESPONSE OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE LIBERAL MEDIA AND ARTS SECTOR TO THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM THE CARRY ON FROM DIRECTORS ACTORS CRITICS CULTURAL TIGHTENS AND INTELLIGENT LEFTY SHE SAYS IS BEYOND PARODY ELITISM ERUPTED LIKE A POISONED BOIL IT'S ALMOST COMIC TO WATCH THE AFFLUENT METROPOLITAN LEFT
BEING CROSS WITH THESE ZERO HOURS STRUGGLERS OF SUNDERLAND FOR DISRESPECTING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF A TORY P.M. AND BIG BUSINESS A STRAP ACROSS THE TOP OF THE TIMES LAMENTS ENGLAND'S DARKEST DAY READERS ARE DIRECTED TO AN INQUEST INSIDE INTO THE NIGHT ENGLAND STOPPED BEING A FOOTBALL TEAM AND BECAME A LAUGHING STOCK THE DAILY MAIL WASTE NO WORDS LOSES IT SAYS ENGLAND'S WOEFUL FOOTBALL MILLIONAIRES
HUMBLED BY ICELAND A NATION FAMED FOR CODFISH LEFT ENGLAND FANS REELING SAYS THE SUN OR MISFIRING MILLIONAIRES WERE FILLED IN BY A DENTIST REFERRING TO THE PART TIME OCCUPATION OF ICELAND'S MANAGER CLUELESS DISMAL SHAMBOLIC HER AMONGST THE ADJECTIVES JOE'S MOTHER DAILY EXPRESS GOD HELP US SAYS THE DAILY STAR
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT LABOUR M.P.S WILL GIVE THEIR VERDICT ON JEREMY CORBIN'S LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY IN A SECRET BALLOT DURING THE DAY WHILE DAVID CAMERON WILL MEET OTHER E.U. LEADERS IN BRUSSELS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LAST WEEK'S BRECK'S IT FATE M.P.S RETURN TO THE FIN MILLION SURROUNDINGS OF PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY AND YOU TO FIND THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFERENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE FOLLOWING THAT BRICKS IT VOTE HERE REPORTING ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT A CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
IT WAS STANDING ROOM ONLY IN THE COMMONS WHEN JEREMY CORBIN ARRIVED
THE LABOUR M.P. DENNIS SKINNER STOOD UP TO SHAKE HIS LEADER WARMLY BY THE HAND BACK IN HIS SEAT MISTER SKINNER TURNED AND STUCK TWO FINGERS UP AT THE LABOUR BENCHES BARELY A MINUTE LATER DAVID CAMERON WALKED IN
GAVE HIM A HERO'S WELCOME AS THEY CHEERED AND WAVED ORDER PAPERS BUT OF COURSE THIS WASN'T A VICTORY LAP THE PRIME MINISTER HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION ANOTHER POLITICAL CAREER HAS JUST STARTED BEFORE M.P.S COULD HEAR MY CAMERON STATEMENT THE NEWEST MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT HAD TO BE SWORN IN LABOUR'S ROSINA ALAN KHAN WON THE RECENT BY ELECTION AT TOOTING IN SOUTH LONDON
MIGHTY GOD BUT I WILL BE FAITHFUL AND BEAR TRUE ALLEGIANCE TO HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH
JESS'S ACCORDING TO LAW SO HELP ME
DAVID CAMERON WELCOMED HER TO WESTMINSTER I THINK I'D ADVISE HER TO KEEP HER MOBILE PHONE ON SHE MIGHT BE THE SHADOW CABINET BY THE END OF THE DAY EVEN THE NEWEST MEMBER JOINED IN THE LAUGHTER AT THAT JOKE ABOUT LABOUR'S LITTLE LOCAL DIFFICULTY AND I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY
DAVID CAMERON'S MAIN MESSAGE WAS THAT ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED NOTHING WILL REALLY CHANGE FOR A WHILE HE ANNOUNCED THAT A NEW UNIT MADE UP OF CIVIL SERVANTS FROM DIFFERENT WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS HAD BEEN SET UP TO PREPARE FOR THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT HE STRESSED THAT HE WILL BE UP TO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER TO TAKE A SERIES OF BIG DECISIONS
AGRICULTURE PAYMENTS OR BORDERS
SITUATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND COMPLEX ISSUES ABOUT WHICH BRITISH LAWS NEED TO BE RE WRITTEN BECAUSE THEY MENTION A LOT OF E.U. LAW AND ALL THE REST OF IT THEY WERE MUTED CHEERS WHEN JEREMY CORBIN RAISED FROM HIS PLACE THE LABOUR LEADER HAD A MESSAGE FOR HIS CRITICS
OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED AND THE COUNTRY WILL SANK NOISE THE BRANCHES IN FRONT OF ME AND ALL THOSE BEHIND FOR INDULGING IN INTERNAL FACTORING MANOEUVRING AT THIS TIME
THERE WERE SHOUTS OF RESIGN AND SOME OF THEM CAME FROM THE LABOUR BENCHES THE LEADER OF THE S.N.P. AT WESTMINSTER ANGUS ROBERTSON PROTESTED THAT VOTERS AND SCOTLAND WERE BEING FORCED OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST THEIR WILL
COME ON A EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND WE WILL STAY
MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM TO PROTECT SCOTLAND
BORIS JOHNSON WASN'T IN THE CHAMBER AND THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GO WASN'T IN HIS PLACE ON THE GOVERNMENT FRONT BENCH INSTEAD HE STOOD NEAR THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR WHICH MEANT SOME M.P.S LIKE THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRON COULDN'T SEE HIM
THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRM THAT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET ARE PARAMOUNT THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF BRITAIN I WOULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF THEIR MEMBERS FOR OXBRIDGE AND SURREY
THE ONLY UKIP MEMBER OF THE COMMONS DOUGLAS CARS WELL WELCOME TO THE PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT NOW THAT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IS THE POLICY OF HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT CAN THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRM THAT SOME OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE VOTE PLEASE CAMPAIGN NOT JUST THE EUROPHILE MANDARINS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE WORK OF THE NEW CABINET OFFICE
DAVID CAMERON SAID MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN PART IN BOTH CAMPAIGNS AND HE WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT THAT DIG AT THE CIVIL SERVICE THEY ARE IMPARTIAL THEY ARE HARD WORKING THEY ARE THE BEST OF BRITISH THEY DO A VERY FINE JOB AND I'M SURE THEY WILL HELP US DELIVER THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND DIFFICULT CHALLENGE
THERE WAS A STRANGE END OF TERM FEEL TO THE EXCHANGES BUT THERE WERE NO CELEBRATIONS FROM M.P.S WHO'D CAMPAIGNED FOR A LEAVE VOTE IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY OVER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
ON FRIDAY MORNING I WOKE NOT ONLY WITH A SONG
THAT WAS THE CONSERVATIVE FORMER CABINET MINISTER LORD TEBBIT BUT ALSO WITH THE WORDS OF THE MAGNIFICAT IN MY HEART
THAT IS HE HATH PUT THE MIGHTY FROM THEIR SEAT AND HE HATH EXALTED
THE HAMBLE AND HUMPTY
A FORMER HEAD OF THE CIVIL SERVICE LORD BUTLER ACROSS SPENT OR INDEPENDENT PIERRE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A SECOND REFERENDUM WANTS THE TERMS OF THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE WERE KNOWN WILL IT NOT BE THE DUTY OF THE GUY
TO GIVE THE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO TAKE AN INFORMED VIEW ON THOSE TERMS BEFORE THE U.K.'S DEPARTURE BECOMES FIVE
BUT DAVID CAMERON HAD ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THERE WOULD BE NO SECOND REFERENDUM AFTER TWO HOURS AT THE DESPATCH BOX AND QUESTIONS FROM ONE HUNDRED AND TEN BACK BENCHERS THE PRIME MINISTER TOLD THE COMMONS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD OBEY THE WILL OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING THERE AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AT HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHEN DAVID CAME AND SITS DOWN FOR DINNER WITH WHAT FOR NOW AT LEAST ARE HIS FELLOW E.U. LEADERS THERE'S ONE GOOD REASON THEY MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN MANY OF THEM WILL BE AWARE THAT THE AFTER SHOCKS OF THE POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE WHICH ROCK BRITAIN THIS WEEK COULD SOON HIT THEM AND THEIR COUNTRIES
A NEW REPORT SUGGESTS THAT THE LEIGH VOTE HERE IS AN EARLY SIGN OF UPRISINGS ALL OVER THE CONTINENT ITS AUTHOR IS SUSIE DENNISON OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS SHE JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND WHERE DO YOU THINK THE CHALLENGE MIGHT COME NEXT TO THE EUROPEAN PROJECT AND FROM WHOM
WELL THEY'RE IN THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE WITH WE PUBLISHED YESTERDAY WE WE WE LOOK TO PARTIES FROM ACROSS THE YEARS AND EIGHT OF EGG EIGHT IN EIGHT DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES THE INSURGENT PARTIES THAT WE'VE COVERED OUR IN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS BUT THEY HOLD SEATS IN TWENTY FIVE MEMBER STATES SO IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT SOME OF THE THEMES THAT WE SAW COMING OUT IN THE U.K. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN A PREVALENT ACROSS ACROSS E.U. STATES
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE PARTIES THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE FOUNDED ON DOMESTIC ISSUES THE IMPACT OF THE REFUGEE CRISIS THE AUSTERITY AGENDA IN EUROPE AND SO ON
IS HE'S LEADING THESE PARTIES TIT TO DO DEVELOP QUITE A STRONG ON FOREIGN POLICY IN EUROPEAN POLICY WHICH IS REALLY CHALLENGING SOME OF THE BASIC TENETS OF THE POSTWAR EUROPEAN CONSENSUS IS THAT WHAT MAKES THESE INSURGENCIES DE FROM WEATHER FROM LEFT ALL RIGHT THEY'RE CHALLENGING FIRST OF ALL THE EUROPEAN PROJECT AS IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AND SECOND OF ALL THE SORT OF ATLANTIS IS FOREIGN POLICY AS WELL
YEAH EXACTLY I MEAN NOT ALL OF THE PARTIES IN QUESTION ARE COMPLETELY ANTI YOU PUT EM US IN SPAIN THE FEIST OUR MOVEMENT IN ITALY HAVE A VERY STRONG REFORM AGENDA FOR IT FOR THE YEAR BUT MOST OF THEM DO HAVE A VERY STRONG ANTI SENTIMENT AND THE S. ANTI AMERICANISM SUSPICION OF OF FREE TRADE BROADLY A SENSE OF BEING PRO RUSSIAN A PREFERENCE FOR CLOSED BORDERS
AND INDEED A STRONG DESIRE FOR DIRECT DEMOCRACY USING THEIR REFERENDUM AS A WEAPON OF CHOICE OUI OUI OUI OUI TRACTS PLANS FOR THIRTY FOR REFERENDUMS ACROSS THE E.U. IN THE COMING YEARS WHICH REALLY POSES A RISK OF PARALYSING ME IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE U.K. REFERENDUM LAST WEEK AS HAS HAS DONE I SUSPECT THE ONE FORCE THAT MAKES PEOPLE MOST NERVES IN BRUSSELS IS MARINE LE PEN THERE FROM NATIONAL IN FRANCE WITH BIG ELECTIONS COMING UP THERE NEXT YEAR
INDEED AND AND WITHIN HOURS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THE RESULTS LAST WEEK IN THE U.K. MARINE LE PEN HAD HAD EXPRESSED
EXUBERANT SUPPORT FOR THE DECISION THE U.K. HAD TAKEN AS DID DES IN THE P. V. V. ADDED THE ASDA B. F. P. O. IN AUSTRIA LEAGUE ANNOY IN ITALY SO SO REALLY THERE'S THERE'S A VERY STRONG GROUP THAT HAVE WATCHED WHAT YOU KEEP HAVE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF HIJACKING THE MAINSTREAM AGENDA IN THE U.K. AND ARE VERY KEEN TO TAKE THAT FORWARD IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES SUSIE DENIZEN OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON CORRELATIONS THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN CHARITIES HAS FALLEN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE THE CHARITIES REGULATOR IN ENGLAND AND WALES STARTED MONITORING IT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE FINDING COMES FROM WORKED ON BY POPULOUS FOR THE CHARITY COMMISSION THEY NOW GRADE TRUST AT FIVE POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN DOWN FROM SIX POINT SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHILE SARAH ATKINSON IS DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS
THE REGULATOR THE CHARITIES COMMISSION IS HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECTS ON ON TRUST
SO THE PUBLIC HAS TOLD US IN THIS REPORT THE DRIVERS THAT HAVE MADE THEM DROP THEIR TRUST IN CHARITIES THEY DESCRIBE THAT TO MEDIA COVERAGE OF POOR PRACTICES THEY DESCRIBE THAT TO PRESSURISING TECHNIQUES FOR FUNDRAISING AND THEY'VE SAID THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ENOUGH ABOUT HOW CHARITIES SPEND THEIR MONEY AND WE BUT THERE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN A STRING OF SCANDALS WHETHER IT'S FROM KIDS COMPANY TO WE KNOW THE SUICIDE OF OLIVE COOKIE WOULD RECEIVE THREE THOUSAND MAILINGS IN A YEAR WE HAD AGE U.K. WITH THIS DEAL IT WAS EARNING COMMISSION ON FOR OLDER PEOPLE
THESE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS THAT ARE PLAYING INTO THE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN SIT AND THINK OF CHARITY YES IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR THE IMPACT OF MEDIA STORIES IS CUMULATIVE AND HIS LONG LASTING AND THIS RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT WHAT THE PUBLIC REALLY CARES ABOUT AND WHEN THE PUBLIC TRUST CHARITY IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE CONFIDENT IN THEIR ETHICAL FUNDRAISING THEY KNOW HOW THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY AND THEY FEEL THAT CHARITIES ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE CAUSES THEY WORK FOR SAID THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT CAN BRING TRUST BACK UP
THERE'S A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE IN THIS RESEARCH AND CHARITIES ALREADY WORKING TO DO THAT THE MESSAGE TODAY IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE AND MORE FOCUS ON THAT BUT CHARITIES ARE ALREADY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS REPORT TELLS US CAN CAN YOU TRANSLATE THIS TRUST TO THE AMOUNT THAT CHARITIES ARE BRINGING IN
WELL AT THE MOMENT DONATIONS AND OF COURSE THOSE THE COUNTY OF DONATIONS IS HIS HISTORIC BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR DONATIONS ARE HOLDING UP VOLUNTEERING IT'S HOLDING UP PEOPLE STILL CARE ABOUT CHARITY IN THIS RESEARCH TELLS US THAT MOST PEOPLE STILL TRUSTS CHARITIES AND MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY DO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SOCIETY I THINK WHAT A DROP LIKE THIS IN TRUST TELLS US AND THE MESSAGES BEHIND IT IT TELLS US THAT IT'S CONDITIONAL THE PUBLIC WILL TRUST CHARITIES IF THEY CAN SEE
THAT THEY'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND IF THEY'RE CONFIDENT IN HOW THEY RAISE AND SPEND THEIR MONEY SO THERE'S A PATH HERE TO REBUILD TRUST BUT IT IS IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT WARNING OF A TREND IS HOW YOU SEE IT I THINK SO WE'VE BEEN TRACKING TRUST AND CONFIDENCE AND CHARITIES FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN A DROP LIKE THIS THE MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT DRIVES TRUST ABOUT HOW YOU RAISE YOUR MONEY HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AND HOW YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT HAVE BEEN CLEAR FOR SOME TIME SO IT IS A CLEAR TREND AND I THINK PARTICULARLY IN
TURBULENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TIMES THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUSTED CHARITY SO THAT CHARITIES CAN PLAY THEIR PART IN REBUILDING COMMUNITIES IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IT'S SUCH A BLUNT MEASURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME CHARITIES ONE IMAGINES WHO ARE STILL HELD IN VERY HIGH ESTEEM PUBLIC OF COURSE AT THIS RESEARCH SHOWS US BOTH THAT CHARITIES AT THE WHOLE OF STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM THERE'S PARTICULAR SUPPORT FOR SMALL CHARITIES AND OF COURSE SOME HOUSEHOLD NAMES HAVE BRILLIANT CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR SUPPORTERS AND MAKE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
I THINK TO REST ON A SINGLE MEASURE AND SAY LET'S CHANGE THINGS WOULD BE A MISTAKE BUT THIS HAS BEEN TELLING US FOR SOME TIME AND OTHER REPORTS TELL US THAT THERE'S A CONSISTENT MESSAGE HERE HOW YOU RAISE AND HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AND THE CONNECTION YOU MAKE WITH THE PUBLIC DRIVES TRUSTING CHARITY AND THE MESSAGE FOR CHARITIES IS WHAT FIRST OF ALL TRANSPARENCY
TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE END CAUSE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR YOUR FUNDRAISING PRACTICES ARE HONEST AND ETHICAL A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON THAT OVER RECENT MONTHS THERE IS GOING TO BE A NEW FUNDRAISING REGULATOR LAUNCHING VERY SHORTLY A LOT OF CHARITIES HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON
SO ETHICAL FUNDRAISING AND CLARITY ABOUT HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY SARAH I CONSENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN JOHN HAMMOND IS BACK WITH THE WEATHER

ANOTHER CABINET MINISTER JEREMY HUNT HAS SUGGESTED THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NEGOTIATE A NEW DEAL WITH THE E.U. AND PUT THAT TO THE VOTERS ROY HODGSON HAS QUIT AS ENGLAND MANAGER AFTER HIS TEAM WAS KNOCKED OUT OF THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT BY ICELAND THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY NEIL SLEET LABOUR M.P.S WILL VOTE TODAY ON A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN JEREMY CORBIN ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF HIS FRONT BENCH TEAM HAVE QUIT IN PROTESTED HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS ROLE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN
LAST NIGHT MISTER CORBIN FACED CALLS TO RESIGN AT HER FRACTURES MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY THE SHADOW JUSTICE MINISTER ANDY SLAUGHTERS THE LATEST MEMBER OF THE FRONT BENCH TO STAND DOWN HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK MISTER CORBIN WAS THE BEST PERSON TO MAXIMISE THE PARTY SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRY BUT THE LABOUR LEADER IS MADE CLEAR HE HAS NO INTENTION OF GOING AS A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG REPORTS
JEREMY CORBIN'S DEFIANCE HAS BEEN BUILT ON HIS INSISTENCE THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN HIM ARE TRYING TO UNSEAT HIM IN WESTMINSTER AND THAT HIS POSITION IS BUTTRESSED BY OVERWHELMING SUPPORT AMONG THE PARTY AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT WITH ONLY HOURS UNTIL A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP AT WESTMINSTER THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HE'S BACKING AWAY FROM PARLIAMENT COULD BE STARTING TO FRAY
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FRONT BENCH ANDY SLAUGHTER HAS JUST JOINED DOZENS OF OTHERS IN RESIGNING BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT MY SLAUGHTER DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A COMRADE OF MISTER CORBIN AND DECIDED TO GO ONLY AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS WHO AGREED HIS DISQUIET CANNOT BE DISMISSED AS THE GRUMBLING HAVE AN M. P. FROM A VERY DIFFERENT WING OF THE PARTY AND I UNDERSTAND HE ALSO TURNED DOWN A PROMOTION TO THE SHADOW CABINET AND QUIT INSTEAD

B. C. THAT IF THE LEADERSHIP DOESN'T CHANGE AND CHANGE COURSE THE PARTY IS LOOKING AT ITS SUPPORT DISAPPEARING IN ENGLAND AS IT'S GONE IN SCOTLAND BUT LAST NIGHT A SPOKESMAN FOR JEREMY KORBEN SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF RESIGNING
THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS RULED HIMSELF OUT AS A CANDIDATE TO BE THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER WRITING THE TIMES HE SAYS THAT HAVING CAMPAIGNED PASSIONATELY FOR HER REMAIN VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM HE DOESN'T BELIEVE HE IS THE PERSON TO UNITE THE PARTY THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT IS THE LATEST CONSERVATIVE UNDERSTOOD TO BE CONSIDERING A LEADERSHIP BID HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON
AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE DAVID CAMERON SIDES GEORGE OSBORNE HAD LONG BEEN TALKED ABOUT AS A POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR NOT NOW I WILL NOT BE A CANDIDATE IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP ELECTION MISTER OSBORNE WRITES ADDING I THOUGHT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT I BELIEVED IN THIS CAUSE AND FOUGHT HARD FOR IT SO IT IS CLEAR THAT WHILST I COMPLETELY ACCEPT THE RESULT I'M NOT THE PERSON TO PROVIDE THE UNITY MY PARTY NEEDS
WRITING IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT SUGGEST THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY THE MECHANISM FOR LEAVING THE Y. YOU STRAIGHT AWAY BUT INSTEAD NEGOTIATES A DEAL AND THEN PUT THAT TO THE PEOPLE EITHER IN ANOTHER REFERENDUM OR IN THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO BEFORE A GENERAL ELECTION
BORIS JOHNSON IN THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY OR CURRENTLY SEEN AS THE FRONT RUNNERS TO REPLACE DAVID CAMERON SOME M.P.S HAVE COMPLAINED THAT GOVERNMENT WHIPS TRADITIONALLY NEUTRAL IN A LEADERSHIP RACE OR PUT PRESSURE ON THEM TO BACK MISSUS MAY OVER MISTER JOHNSON
DAVID CAMERON WILL TRAVEL TO BRUSSELS TODAY TO MEET EUROPEAN LEADERS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BRITAIN'S VOTE VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS EXPECTED TO URGE THEM TO TAKE A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. REPORTING FROM BRUSSELS ARE EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS
OVER THE YEARS DAVID CAMERON HAS COME TO MANY AN E.U. SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS PROMISING TO BATTLE FOR BRITAIN BUT AFTER LOSING LAST WEEK'S REFERENDUM THIS LOOKS SET TO BE HIS FINAL SKIRMISH AND IT COULD BE A HUMBLING OCCASION THERE'S CONSIDERABLE ANGER ACROSS THE E.U. THAT HE CALLED THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT THE PROCESS LEADING UP TO A U.K. EXIT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRAG ON AND ON
E. USE MOST INFLUENTIAL LEADERS ARE PREPARED TO GIVE THE U.K. A LITTLE MORE TIME TO GET ITS NEGOTIATING HOUSE IN ORDER BUT NOT TOO MUCH AND THEY'VE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO INFORMAL TALKS WITH THE U.K. BEFORE ARTICLE FIFTY IS INVOKED
THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN E.U. COUNTRIES WILL MEET WITHOUT THE U.K. FOR THE FIRST TIME TOMORROW AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WILL SUDDENLY NO LONGER BE AT THE TABLE IT IS AN OUTCOME THAT EVEN ONE WEEK AGO FEW PEOPLE EXPECTED
ASIAN STOCK MARKETS HAVE RALLIED AND STIRLING HAS STRENGTHENED SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND BEGAN THAT NICK ANGEL IS UP BY HALF OF ONE PER CENT IN PART BECAUSE OF EXPECTATIONS OF STIMULUS MEASURES BY CENTRAL BANKS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE U.K.'S LEAVE VOTE
ENGLAND HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT OF THE EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS BY ICELAND PROMPTING THE RESIGNATION OF THE MANAGER ROY HODGSON FORMER PLAYERS HAVE LIKENED THE TWO ONE DEFEAT TO ENGLAND'S MOST EMBARRASSING LOSS THE UNITED STATES IN THE NINETEEN FIFTY WORLD CUP ALAN SHEARER HAS CALLED IT THE WORST PERFORMANCE FROM AN ENGLAND TEAM EVER FANS SANG YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WEAR THE SHIRT A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROWAN WAS AT THE MATCH IN THESE
ENGLAND ARE NO STRANGERS TO EMBARRASSING EXITS FROM CHAMPIONSHIPS BUT THIS WAS A NEW LOW ARGUABLY THE MOST INFAMOUS RESULT IN THEIR HISTORY THE TEAM PLUMBING NEW DEPTHS THEY WERE HUMBLED BY A BRAVE AND SPIRITED ICELAND A COUNTRY WITH A POPULATION OF JUST THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND IN THIS THEIR FIRST EVER MAJOR TOURNAMENT DEFEATED MANAGER ROY HODGSON RESIGNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GAME AFTER FOUR YEARS IN CHARGE
SO HE'S HAD TO IN THIS WAY WITH ANOTHER EXIT
BUT THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL RIGHT WHOSE WISH EVERYBODY ALL THE VERY BEST THE SEARCH FOR A NEW MANAGER TO TAKE ON THIS MOST TOXIC OR FOOTBALL TASKS WILL NOW BEGIN ALONG WITH THE ALL TOO FAMILIAR INQUEST INTO WHAT WENT WRONG FOR A COUNTRY THAT BOASTS SOME OF THE BEST PAID PLAYERS IN THE WORLD
A REPORT BY THE SPENDING WATCHDOG THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THE PROPOSED NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK H. S. TWO IS UNDER FINANCIAL STRAIN AND MAY HAVE TO BE DELAYED
M.P.S ARE DUE TO VOTE LATER THIS YEAR ON WHETHER TO GO AHEAD WITH THE FIRST PHASE OF THE FIXED IT FIFTY SIX BILLION POUND PROJECT IS OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT
H. S. TWO WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE ENGINEERING PROJECTS BRITAIN'S EVER TAKEN ON BUT THIS REPORT SAYS THAT DESPITE SOME POSITIVES THE TIMETABLE TO GET IT DONE IS UNREALISTIC AND ARE CURRENTLY ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING
THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT LINKING BIRMINGHAM TO LONDON IS DUE TO OPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX BUT THE COMPANY SET UP TO DELIVER THE LINE H. S. TWO LIMITED HAS BEEN ASKED TO LOOK AT WHETHER DELAYING THAT BY A YEAR COULD CUT COSTS THEY'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD TO FIND BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF SAVINGS FOR THE SECOND PHASE OF THE PROJECT LINKING UP BIRMINGHAM WITH MANCHESTER AND LEEDS H. S. TWO LIMITED AND THE GOVERNMENT INSIST THE LINE WILL BE OPEN ON TIME AND ON BUDGET
A PRISON CHAPLAIN WHOSE SON IS ACCUSED OF HACKING INTO SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND STEALING INFORMATION OR SETTEE FEARS HIS SON WILL KILL HIMSELF IF HE SENT FOR TRIAL IN AMERICA LOWRY LOVE WHO'S THIRTY ONE AND FROM SUFFOLK HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AS BURGERS AND DEPRESSION A TWO DAY HEARING TO DECIDE IF HE SHOULD BE EXTRADITED IS DUE TO START THIS MORNING AS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANIEL SANDFORD EXPLAINS
IN AMERICAN COURT DOCUMENTS LARRY LOVE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SOPHISTICATED AND PROLIFIC COMPUTER HACKER HE'S ALLEGED TARGETS INCLUDED THE U.S. ARMY THE F.B.I. THE MISSILE DEFENCE AGENCY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND NASA
LARRY LOVE WHO'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ASPERGER'S AND RECURRENT DEPRESSION WAS ORIGINALLY ARRESTED BY THE U.K. NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO BUT NO CHARGES WERE BROUGHT THE U.S. EXTRADITION REQUESTS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE LAST SUMMER BARRY LOVES LAWYERS WILL ARGUE THAT SOMEONE WITH HIS POOR MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD NOT BE EXTRADITED TO AMERICA FOR SOMETHING WHICH YOU COULD STAND TRIAL FOR IN THIS COUNTRY
DANIEL SANDFORD REPORT IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S A NATIONAL HUMILIATION A ONCE PROUD NATION FORCED OUT OF EUROPE THE MAN MEANT TO BE IN CHARGE YOU DIDN'T SEE IT COMING AS QUIT THERE IS IT SEEMS NO PLAN FOR WHERE THE COUNTRY IS NOW HEADING YES ENGLAND
OR OUT OF THE EUROS DEFEATED BY A NATION WITH A POPULATION THE SAME SIZE AS THE CITY OF LEICESTER THE SMALLEST COUNTRY EVER QUALIFY FOR A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT WHICH ONLY HAS ENOUGH REGISTERED PLAYERS TO MAKE UP A DOZEN TEAMS THIS IS HOW A SISTER STATION FIVE LIVE REPORT AT THE END OF A GAME AND NATION WILL WANT DESPERATELY TO FORGET
THERE WAS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A RATHER MORE EXCITABLE RESPONSE FROM THE ICELANDIC COMMENTARY TEAM
HE REALLY SHOULD SHOULD IT BE THAT PUTS A SMILE ON YOUR FACE WONDER IF IT DOES ON THE FACE OF GRAHAM LET'S GO FORMER ENGLAND INTERNATIONAL OF COURSE WHO JOINS HIS MORNING TO YOU GRAHAM
GOOD MORNING MORNING TWO TWO HOURS DOESN'T IT DOES IT DOES PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE NECK BUT THAT'S LOT NOT NOT VERY LONG LASTING CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE IT DID YOU PUT IT DOWN AS ALAN SHEARER DID INDEED THE BACK PAGE OF ALISON'S PAPER THE TIMES CALLS IT ARGUABLY THE MOST EMBARRASSING DEFEAT IN THE NATIONAL TEAMS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR YEAR HISTORY
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF WHO WE PLAYED IN THE SIZE OF ICELAND THE PLAYERS THEY PRODUCE THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE YOU COULD BE FOOLED INTO SAYING THAT BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO GIVE ICE AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF CREDIT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY QUALIFIED THROUGH THEIR GROUP HOLLAND WIN THEIR GROUP THEY'VE GOT THROUGH THERE THE GROUP STAGES OF THE EUROS
TO EARN THE RIGHT TO PLAY AGAINST ENGLAND AND THEY PERFORM MAGNIFICENTLY BUT THEY HAD ALL THE QUALITIES THAT YOU EXPECT FROM A TEAM DESPITE NOT NECESSARILY HAVING OUTSTANDING PLAYERS AND THAT SOMETHING IN STARK CONTRAST WITH ENGLAND'S PERFORMANCE GIVEN THE QUALITY OF PLAYERS THAT WE HAVE
AMOUNTS INVESTED IN FOOTBALL THE FACT THAT WE COULDN'T PRODUCE A PATTERN A STYLE AND IDENTITY THAT THE ICELANDIC TEAM HAD AND THAT'S THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES I WAS IN RED ARE THE TIMES HE'S THAT WOULD TEAM THAT SEEMS TO SUM UP WHAT YOU DO AND SIMPLY HAVEN'T GOT WELL PAID INDIVIDUALS FANTASTICALLY WELL PAID INDIVIDUALS THE MOST SENSE OF TEA
YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY IT ACTUALLY I TIPS ICELAND TO BRING THE WHOLE THING BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT STARTED I DID PARTLY TO BE CONTRARY BUT PARTLY TO HIGHLIGHT THAT VERY POINT THE REASON
ARE IMPRESSIVE IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SMALL AND HAVE A PROGRAMME IN PLACE STUDENT TO GET OVER THE FACT THAT IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE AND YOU ARE AS HE'S ON THAT IT'S A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE IN ENGLAND HAVEN'T REALLY EVER HAT
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT BOTH AS A NATIONAL IDENTITY AND A FOOTBALLING IDENTITY BECAUSE IT'S A SUCCESSFUL PUT PROGRAMME IN THIS COUNTRY WE'VE NEVER HAD TO THINK HOW DID YOU GET BETTER JUST TO SINGLE AND YET YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU PUT A GROUP OF PLAYERS TOGETHER I'M DIFFERENT
FOOTBALL CLUBS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO REALLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO IDENTIFIABLE PATTERN TO AN ENGLISH TEAM YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY LOOK JUST LIKE ENGLAND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS THAT IS A PROBLEM WHERE DO YOU LOOK I WASN'T YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE BY THE KING GRAHAM SHOULD FOOTBALL LOOKED TO RUGBY WE SAW HOW THE TRANSITION FROM STUART LANCASTER TO EDDIE JONES TOOK BASICALLY THE SAME SET OFF APPARENTLY FAILING PLAYERS TWO ENORMOUS SUCCESS
I CERTAINLY THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A WHOLE PROGRAMME IN TERMS OF HOW WE EDUCATE OUR COACH SHE WAS ALL THE WAY THROUGH FROM GRASS ROOTS TO TO CREATE AN IDENTITY FOR THE THE ENGLAND SIDE WHEN YOU IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NATIONAL TEAM BEING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FOOTBALL IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FOR ENGLISH PLAYERS AS IT IS AND AS ALISON SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SHAPE A PATTERN A PLAN IN WHICH TO OVERCOME DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU LOOK AT EVERY TEAM THAT SUCCESSFUL I WAS WATCHING THE ITALY GAME YESTERDAY WHEN THEY PLAYED SPAIN AND YOU CAN TELL WITHIN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES WHAT ITALY'S GAME PLAN WAS
AND THESE PLAYERS ARE VERY EXPERIENCED TALENTED HIGHLY PAID AS WELL BUT THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM AND THAT'S WHAT GETS YOU THROUGH CERTAIN PHASES ARE VERY TOUGH MATCHES WHAT I'M GOING BACK TO ENGLAND THE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A HARD GAME YESTERDAY I DESERVED TO BE THERE AND CLEARLY THEY DESERVED TO WIN THE MATCH AND THEY DID IT SYSTEMATICALLY THEY DID IT WITH EVERY PLAYER NOT PLAYING FOR THEMSELVES BUT PLAYING AS A TEAM AND GIVING EVERY PART OF THEMSELVES FOR THAT TEAM BRING RE FINAL THOUGHTS IF YOU WOULD BED HAMSTRUNG
WALES VERSUS ICELAND IN THE FINAL PERHAPS
I'LL GO FOR THAT ICELAND OF COURSE I WOULD I KNOW AND IT WOULD BE WALES TAG LIKE THIS TOURNAMENT HAS BEEN STRONGER TOGETHER AGAIN ANOTHER TEAM RECOGNISE
THEY HAVE TO BE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF OUR PARTS IS THE SEA AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU KNOW THAT SUDDENLY MORE ENERGY IS MORE OF A USED AROUND YOU MAKE LIFE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME BUT A SON CALLED TOP PLAYERS ON THAT SORT OF HARRY DIDN'T HASSLE AND IT'S RELENTLESS AND IF YOU'D LIKE YOU TRYING TO DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT YOU ARE YOU WILL FAIL GRAHAM A QUICK PREDICTION FROM HERE
WHAT WHALES ICELAND FINAL I'M NOT A BETTING MAN MAKE BUT I'LL GIVE YOU TEN TO ONE ON THAT I DO EXIST WOULD ROUND THE COUNTRY LOOKING FOR THEIR WELSH ROOTS IN ORDER TO CLAIM THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS SUPPORTING THE DRAGONS GRAHAM LE SO ALISON ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN MORE THAN FORTY OF JEREMY CORBIN'S TOP TEAM HAVE NOW RESIGNED IN PROTEST AT HIS LEADERSHIP HE FACES A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE TODAY BUT HE IS STILL INSISTING THAT HE WILL NOT GO THOUSANDS TURNED OUT IN PARLIAMENT SQUARE LAST NIGHT TO SUPPORT HIM HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD THEM
I DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS WHILE IMAGINES O. KAY
I HAVE TO WALK AWAY FROM ANY INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPLACE THEM
NOT NOW
HEY LOLA TICKLE ATMOSPHERE
IT IS ABOUT CHALLENGING THOSE ORTHODOXY
WELL ON THE PLATFORM AT STANDING ALONGSIDE HIM LAST NIGHT WAS THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE FROG FIRE BRIGADE UNION MATCH RACK WHO'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING MORNING HI EVEN THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DAILY MIRROR THIS MORNING HAS A PICTURE OF JEREMY CORBIN WITH TWO BIG WORDS AND PLAYS AND ACROSS THE FRONT GO NOW THEY MAKE THE POINT YOU'RE A DECENT MAN BUT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PARTY AND FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY GO NOW WHY HOW CAN HE STAY
WELL HE'S GOT A HUGE MANDATE FROM THE LABOUR PARTY FROM THE LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS JUST NINE MONTHS AGO AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO CHANGE THAT SO WHAT WE'VE HAD IS PEOPLE PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES IN WESTMINSTER I THINK SUMMING UP EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH BRITISH POLITICS IT'LL BE POLITICIANS ARE SEEN AS REMOTE FROM ORDINARY PEOPLE AND WHAT WE SEE IS THAT PLAYED OUT IN SECRET WELL PLANNED ORCHESTRATED
A COUP AGAINST JEREMY CORBIN OVER THE PAST TWO DAYS BUT IT ISN'T JUST THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST HIM FROM THE BEGINNING OVERNIGHT WE HAD THE LIKES OF ANDY SLAUGHTER WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A COMRADE OF JEREMY CORBIN SAYING AFTER CONSULTING HIS LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS HE'D COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO CONSULT LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS AND THEY WILL HAVE TO GO TO A VOTE ONLY LOCAL
PART OF PARTY MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULD MAKE A DECISION IN REALITY THEY ARE TRYING TO CREATE A POSITION WHEREBY GERRY COULD THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN FORCE JEREMY CORBIN TO RESIGN WITHOUT ANY GENUINE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OH SO TALK US THROUGH HOW YOU CAN SEE THIS WORKING HE FACES A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE TODAY A VOTE HE'S LIKELY TO LOSE HE STANDS AGAIN IN ANY LEADERSHIP ELECTION AND YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT HE WILL WIN THAT
YES I THINK HE WILL AND THAT AND WHEN HE DOES WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT HE'S STRUGGLING TO FILL THE POSTS IN HIS SHADOW CABINET I WOULD URGE SOULS LABOUR M.P.S TO RECONSIDER WHAT THEY ARE DOING LET'S JUST PUT THIS IN THE POLITICAL CONTACTS WE'VE GOT A POLITICAL CRISIS IN BRITAIN WE'VE GOT A REFERENDUM WITH A GOVERNMENT NOT KNOWING WHAT IT DOES NEXT THAT LEADERS OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY DO NEXT
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY EXPECT POLITICIANS TO BE THINKING ABOUT PARTICULARLY LABOUR POLITICIANS TO BE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PROTECT JOBS WAGES PUBLIC SERVICES IN A VERY DIFFICULT NEGOTIATION ABOUT BREAKS SET OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN POLITICAL GAMES BEING PLAYED OUT BY SMALL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN RICHMOND THEY WOULD SAY THESE ARE NOT POLITICAL GAMES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING A GENERAL ELECTION WHERE THEY EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE WIPED OUT BECAUSE THE POLLING SUGGESTS
THAT THREE OUT OF TEN OF THOSE WHO SUPPORTED LABOUR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN OF COURSE IT DID VERY BADLY WILL NOT VOTE LABOUR AT THE NEXT WELL INTERESTINGLY IN TERMS OF ENGAGING WITH LABOUR SUPPORTERS FIRST OF ALL LABOUR'S VOTE ON THE REFERENDUM WAS BROADLY IN LINE WITH SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF LABOUR VOTERS VOTED TO REMAIN BROADLY IN LINE WITH WHAT THE S. M.P.'S POSITION IS THAT THOSE LABOUR M.P.S WHO ARE CRITICISING CORBIN COULD NOT WIN THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR OWN
YAT SO AND YOU'RE TO BLAME CORBIN FOR THAT POSITION IS IS PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS WHAT WE DID SEE THOUGH IN THE REVOKED LAST WEEK THAT IT WAS LABOUR'S HEARTLANDS WHERE THE VOTE WAS VERY HIGH AND IN MANY CASES THAT WAS BECAUSE
FOR EXAMPLE IMMIGRATION SOMETHING THAT HE HASN'T PARTICULARLY ENGAGE WITH WELL TO SMOKE FOR THE FIRST OF ALL AS A SAFE SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF LABOUR VOTERS VOTED TO REMAIN THAT'S AS HIGH AS AS ANY OF THE MAINSTREAM PART ALMOST AS HIGH AS ANY OF THE MAINSTREAM PARTIES ACHIEVED ANOTHER SAFE HAD LABOUR M.P.S HILARY BENN COULDN'T WIN THE ELECTRA TINGS ON CONSTITUENCY MARGARET HODGE COULDN'T WIN THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN THEIR OWN CONSENT CAN HE WIN A GENERAL ELECTION YES HE CAN ON HE CAN GENERAL ELECTION WHAT
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS A MYSTERY SOME UNITY IN THE LABOUR PARTY AROUND THE POLICIES THAT THE LABOUR PARTY STANDS FOR AND SHOULD BE STANDING FOR WHICH IS ABOUT ENGAGING WITH THE INTERESTS OF REAL ORDINARY PEOPLE THAT ROTTEN PLAYING SILLY GAMES MATT RACH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY PAST SEVEN WE KNOW THE MARKETS ARE IN TURMOIL BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOUR SAVINGS DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS BACK TO TELL US
THANKS NICK I'M JOINED BY SOMEONE WHO SHOULD KNOW ONE OF THE BIG BEASTS OF THE CITY MARTIN GILBERT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT THE THIRD LARGEST FUND MANAGER IN EUROPE MARTIN WHAT SHOULD ORDINARY SAVERS BE THINKING CONFRONTED WITH THIS KIND OF MARKET TURMOIL I THINK THE KEY THING IS TO DO NOTHING AT THE MOMENT I KNOW THAT SOUNDS COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT BUT THE KEY IS NOT TO PANIC
NOT NOT SELL THAT AT THE BOTTOM ARE NEAR THE BOTTOM BUT TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES BUT THE BEST THING IS JUST SIT ON YOUR HANDS AND WAIT FOR FOR THIS TO PASS OVER THIS IS A STRANGE KIND OF MARKET ISN'T IT WE WERE TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT HOW THE BANKS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED
BUT THERE ARE POCKETS IN THIS MARKET ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY FINE CAN YOU KIND OF EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WELL I THINK THE MARKET'S IT'S PRETTY EFFICIENT IT LOOKS AT WHO WILL DO WELL DURING THE RECESSION AND WHO MIGHT NOT DO SO WELL AND THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON THE HOUSE BUILDERS THEY THINK HOUSE PRICES ARE GOING TO COME UNDER PRESSURE AND BANKS
BECAUSE OF LOWER INTEREST RATES IT'S GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE MONEY THEY'VE GOT BIG LOAN PORTFOLIOS INVESTED IN PROPERTY SO THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS OF THE MARKET BUT BUT I THINK THEY'RE LARGELY OPEN MYSELF AND THEREFORE
THE KEY IS AS I SAID JUST DO NOTHING DON'T SELL YOUR BANK SHARES AT THE MOMENT I WOULD SAY BUT OF COURSE I MAY BE WRONG THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL OF DOOM AND GLOOM IN THE CITY OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I'M NOT A BIG BUSINESS PEOPLE CAMPAIGNED IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN THAT THE CITY WAS I THINK LARGELY IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN
DO YOU THINK THE CITY OF LONDON HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY THIS I DON'T THINK SO LONG TERM I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE MAIN REASON THE CITY VOTED REMAIN WAS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY SO WE HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTY AT THE MOMENT BUT ONCE THAT PERIOD IS OVER THE CITY WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL I THINK AND WILL BE THE CENTRE OF A FINANCIAL SERVICES IN EUROPE AGAIN
IN THE PREVIOUS SCOTTISH REFERENDUM YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIG SUPPORTERS OF SCOTLAND BREAKING AWAY FROM FROM ENGLAND WHAT WOULD BE WHAT WILL YOU DO CONFRONTED WITH THIS PROSPECT OF THE REFEREE AND THE SECOND REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND OR SCOTLAND SOMEHOW JOINING JOINING BACK TO EUROPEAN UNION WOULD YOU SUPPORT THEM I DOMINIC MY OFFICIAL POSITION WAS NEUTRAL I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GOT THIS PERCEPTION THAT I WAS IN FAVOUR OF INDEPENDENCE BUT BUT I THINK LOOK NICOLETTE'S NICOLA IS A PRETTY CAUTIOUS POLITICIAN SHE'S A VERY GOOD POLITICIAN
SHE'S NOT GOING TO GO FOR A REFERENDUM UNLESS SHE'S PRETTY SURE SHE'S GOING TO SHE'S GOING TO WIN IT BUT SHE IS IN A STRONG POSITION AT THE MOMENT BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW EUROPE REACT TO SCOTLAND WHETHER THEY ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN I THINK THAT'S THE KEY POINT WHETHER SCOTLAND CAN REMAIN IN EUROPE AND IT'S IF SHE FEELS THEY CAN SHE MAY WELL GO FOR A REFERENDUM
JUST A FINAL WORD ON THE MARKETS YOUR MESSAGES DON'T PANIC DON'T PANIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARTIN GILBERT OF ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT
DOMINIC THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN NO NOTIFICATION NO NEGOTIATION THAT'S BEEN THE CLEAR MESSAGE FROM THE E.U. TALKS CANNOT BEGIN ON OUR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. UNTIL WE NOTIFY THEM OF A DECISION TO LEAVE AND THE PRIME MINISTER'S MAKE CLEAR THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR IS IN PLACE SO WHAT HAPPENS TODAY HE'LL BE MEETING OR TWENTY SEVEN OTHER LEADERS BEFORE THEY ASK HIM TO LEAVE SO THAT THEY CONTINUE CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS IN PRIVATE YESTERDAY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY APPEALED FOR CALM
SO I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE STAY FOCUSED ON HOW IN THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
NOBODY LOSES THEIR HEAD NOBODY GOES OFF HALF COCKED PEOPLE DON'T START JENNINGS THERE SCATTERBRAIN OR A REVENGEFUL
PREMISES BUT WE LOOK FOR A WAY IS TO MAINTAIN THEIR STRENGTH THAT WILL SERVE THE INTERESTS AND THE VALUES THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE
RICHARD CORBETT IS A LABOUR M.E.P. WHO KNOWS HER BRUSSELS WORKS HE USED TO ADVISE HERMANN VON ROM POI AND HE JOINS US FROM BRUSSELS NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING DO YOU THINK THAT MESSAGE FROM A JOHN KERRY WILL BE HEEDED TODAY AT THESE MEETINGS
I THINK AT THE MEETINGS THEY PROBABLY WILL BE WHETHER THEY ARE ON THE MARKETS IS ANOTHER MATTER BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS YOU'RE HINTING THERE IS THAT ACTUALLY MARKETS EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS HAVE BEEN FALLING AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN THE U.K. MARKET SO IT'S NOT JUST THE CALLS FOR REFERENDA THAT ARE MAKING LEADERS NERVOUS
WELL THE IMMEDIATE THING TODAY IS THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID OTHER COUNTRIES WANT THE PROCEDURE TRIGGERED RELATIVELY SOON TO GET IT SORTED OUT QUICKLY DAVID CAMERON DOESN'T WANT TO TRIGGER IT HERE AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY HE DOESN'T WANT TO TRIGGER THE NEGOTIATIONS YEP BECAUSE FIRST BRITAIN HAS TO DECIDE WHAT IT ACTUALLY WANTS
IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THOSE WISHING TO LEAVE THE E.U. OFFERED TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS AND WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE VISIONS ONE LOT SAID O.K. WE WILL STAY IN THE SINGLE MARKET WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRADE ON THAT BASIS BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THE RULES OF THAT MARKET INCLUDING FREE MOVEMENT WHICH MANY PEOPLE WERE OPPOSED TO
WHILE OTHERS SAID NO NO LET'S LEAVE THE SINGLE MARKET ENTIRELY TRADE MORE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT THEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE THE COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFFS SO ALL BRITISH MANUFACTURED GOODS SOLD IN EUROPE WOULD FACE A TARIFF WHICH WOULD HAVE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE TWO OPTIONS BOTH OF THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGES AND IS IT REALLY SO BINARY IS THERE NOT SOME MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO PERHAPS A LOWER PRICE TO BE PAID FOR LEAVING THE SINGLE MARKET OR FOOT FOR RESTRICTING FREE MOVEMENT THAT ULTIMATELY IT IS IN THE OTHER E.U. LEADERS INTEREST TO DO AS WELL
ALL THAT LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS COS CUNTS ALSO PERHAPS BE EXPLORED BUT JUST AS THEY WOULD BE SORT OF HALFWAY BETWEEN THE TWO OPTIONS THEY WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF EACH OPTION AND THAT'S WHEN MANY PEOPLE WHO WHO WROTE AT LEAN WILL SAY WELL HANG ON A MINUTE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE VOTED FOR THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT IT WHERE DO YOU THINK WE'LL END UP WHAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP DO YOU SEE AS BEING ON THE TABLE
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THAT FOR BRITAIN'S ECONOMY TO STILL SECURE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET SO MANY JOBS IN BRITAIN DEPEND ON THAT SO MUCH OF OUR OWN ECONOMY DEPENDS ON THAT WHETHER WE CAN DO IT AFTER JUST WALKING OUT SLAMMING THE DOOR IS THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION BUT THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE AIMING TO DO
RICHARD CORBETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SEVEN ROB ROB BONNET IS HERE WITH THE SPORT NICK THANKS WELL PLENTY OF BLACK HUMOUR AROUND ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOLLOWING ENGLAND'S HUMILIATING TWO ONE DEFEAT BY ICELAND IN THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP IN THESE AND THE RESIGNATION IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS OF MANAGER ROY HODGSON HOW ABOUT THIS GLOOMY PREDICTION FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK FROM SHARPIE ON TWITTER
TUESDAY MURRAY EXITS WIMBLEDON WEDNESDAY STONEHENGE FALLS OVER THURSDAY BOND ACTUALLY WORKING FOR THE RUSSIANS FRIDAY
T. BAD FOR YOU BUT THE TRUTH IS SURELY AN ENGLAND FANS HAVE BECOME ANAESTHETISED TO UNDER PERFORMANCE IN MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS AND WAYNE ROONEY THE SCORER OF ENGLAND'S EARLY PENALTY YESTERDAY WAS UNDERSTANDABLY IN LESS THAN BUOYANT MOOD
DISAPPOINTED THAT UPSET AND ANGRY BECAUSE WHAT THE SCENE TONIGHT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND IT IS EMBARRASSING IF YOU LIKE TO GO OLD BOY THAT'S FOOTBALL WE WE TRIADS WE GIVE UP YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T IT
I ENJOY HIM PROUD TO PLAY FOR ENGLAND AND INTERESTED TO SEE THE NEXT MANJIT IS AND IF THAT'S IT THEN
HER FUTURE IS BASED IN ENGLAND HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE AND THERE'S GOOD THINGS TO COMMON ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AND TO SEE THAT NOW I THINK HE'S BEEN GOOD TO THE PLAYERS AND EFFEMINATE AND SO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT JOHN MARRY IN THE STRONGER WANTED TO KNOW QUESTION HIM ICELAND WERE WELL WORTH THEIR WIN WEREN'T THEY BUT WHAT FOR YOU WAS THE MOST ALARMING ASPECT OF THINGS BEFORE YOU SET IT ROBBIE USED THE WORD HUMILIATING I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST EMBARRASSING DEFEATS OF ALL TIME FOR THE ENGLAND NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN FOR ICELAND IT'S PROBABLY THE FINEST HOUR IN THEIR FOOTBALL HISTORY PROBABLY THEIR SPORTING HISTORY AND WE SHOULD WE SHOULD CERTAINLY PAY TRIBUTE TO THEM
THE MOST ALARMING ASPECT FOR ME IS THAT ENGLAND LOOK LIKE A TEAM THAT WASN'T PROPERLY PREPARED LAST NIGHT AND I MEAN TACTICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND WITH ENGLAND
THE MESSAGE IS ALWAYS THE TEAM HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER PREPARED WEAVE WEAVE
CROSSED EVERY POSSIBLE EVENTUALITY AND THE TEAM HAS BEEN PREPARED BUT IN THIS MATCH TACTICALLY IT WAS MUDDLED AND EQUALLY IT LOOKED LIKE THEY COULDN'T COPE MENTALLY
AND THE THE GOT THE EARLY GOAL ENGLAND SCORED AN EARLY GOAL THAT SHOULD HAVE SETTLED THEM DOWN BUT INSTEAD CONSIDER THE EQUALISER EIGHTY FOUR SECONDS LATER AND THAT APPEARED TO MAKE THEM
FREEZE THEY WERE FEARFUL FEARFUL OF WHAT BEING KNOCKED OUT BY ICELAND WOULD DO TO THEIR REPUTATIONS AND THEY COULDN'T COPE WITH IT FOR TACTICALLY MUDDLED
MENTALLY FEARFUL AND THAT WAS A MIX THAT MEANT THAT ROY HODGSON HAD NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO CONFIRM HIS DEPARTURE AS SOON AS HE DID AFTER THE MATCH YES WHICH TAKES US THEN ONTO THE IDENTITY POTENTIAL IDENTITY OF THE NEW MANAGER GARETH SOUTHGATE IS THE FRONT
I THINK GARETH SOUTHGATE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY APPOINTMENT THE WORLD CUP QUALIFYING CAMPAIGN BEGINS RIGHT AT THE START OF SEPTEMBER
INGA WILL HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY AND RAY LEWINGTON AND GARY NEVILLE HAVE LEFT SO THERE WOULD BE A STAFF TO A POINT BUT GARETH SOUTHGATE IS ON THE INSIDE HE'S THE CURRENT UNDER TWENTY ONE COACH HE WAS SUCCESSFUL JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO HERE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE AT THE TWO LONG TOURNAMENT WHICH I THINK WILL HAVE DONE HIM NO HARM AT ALL AND ALSO DOWN ASHWORTH THE TECHNICAL DIRECTOR WHO WILL BE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE APPOINTMENT OF ROY HODGSON SUCCESSOR I KNOW THAT HE IS VERY CLOSE TO GARETH SOUTHGATE
A PERSONAL VIEW THOUGH I HAVE LONG FELT THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHAT ARSON THING AT THE ARSENAL MANAGER WOULD DO
WITH THE ENGLAND TEAM WERE HE TO BE IN A POSITION AND WHERE HE TOOK TO WANT THE JOB WILL HE TO TO TO WANT THE JOB AND TO LEAVE ARSENAL
AND BRIEFLY JOHN A BRICK A THOUGHT ABOUT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF ALL THIS YOU KNOW MAYBE A NEW MANAGER IS JUST A BIT A STICKING PLASTER
I AGREE I THINK I THINK IT IS I THINK IT IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM I THINK ENGLAND NEED THE RIGHT MAN IN CHARGE WHICH IS WHY I'VE OFFERED ARSE AND VANYA TO YOU BUT MY WORRY IS THAT
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF ENGLAND FOOTBALLERS HAVE BEEN SCARRED BY THEIR TOURNAMENT EXPERIENCES AND THIS WAS AND IT WAS AN EXCITING YOUNG SQUAD YET THOSE PLAYERS ON THERE ALSO SCARRED
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WELL I THINK I WANT TO FACE HOSTS FRANCE IN THE LAST EIGHT DEFENDING CHAMPIONS SPAIN ARE ALSO OUT THERE HAD BEEN TO KNOW BASICALLY WHO NOW FACE GERMANY QUITE A RESULT ME WELL FOR MARCUS WILLIS AT WIMBLEDON STOCKPORT BORN AGED TWENTY FIVE AND RANKED SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY SECOND IN THE WORLD HE'D BE LITHUANIA'S FIFTY FOURTH RANK RICARDO'S PARANG KISS IN STRAIGHT SETS AND YOUR NEXT PLACE ROGER FEDERER WHO YOU WILL HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE

BUT YOU COULD SAVE MONEY BY DOING IT UP TO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE HAVE TO GET ROYAL ASSENT WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT OUR TENDERS WHAT REALLY IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE ACHIEVED IN THE LAST MONTH WITH THE SENT OUT THE TENDERS NOW FOR THE MAJOR CIVIL CONTRACTS ELEVEN BILLION POUNDS RATHER WORK MAJOR MILESTONE WE ACHIEVED THERE AREN'T THERE IS MORE IN THIS REPORT WHICH IS ABOUT PHASE TWO YOU MAKE THE POINT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION ON THE PROJECT OF THIS SCALE IS THIS SMALL
YOU LOOK AT THE SECOND PHASE THAT'S OVER RUNNING BY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS NO IT DOESN'T SAY THAT AT ALL I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE WORDS THE ESTIMATED COST OF FACE TWO EXCEEDED AVAILABLE FUNDING BY SEVEN BILLION POUNDS IN THE NEXT LINE
IN THE NEXT NINE SAYS N. WE'VE JUST IDENTIFY AARONOW NINE NINE BILLION POUNDS RATHER SAVING THAT SAYING THERE'S TWO MILLION OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SECURE WHAT STILL FIVE BILLION SHORT NO NO NO WON'T SAY HE WAS NINE BILLION POUNDS OF HER SAVINGS SO WHEN YOU TAKE NINE AWAY FROM SEVEN YOU'VE GOT TO SAY WHAT WHAT THE REPORT SAYING AND THAT'S A KEY THING ABOUT THIS INDEPENDENT REPORTS SAYING BOTH AND PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO THERE IS A GOOD CUT THERE IS A SENSIBLE AND VALIDATE THE CROSSFIRE I THINK
I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF READING THIS REPORT BECAUSE YOU'RE NO ONE OF THESE SUGGESTIONS THAT IS A RESULT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER WAYS WITH PHASE TWO TO FIND BILLIONS OF POUNDS' WORTH OF SAVINGS AND THE SUGGESTION IS THAT PERHAPS
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE ROUTES THAT YOU WILL NEED TO LOOK AT THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT YOU NEED TO FIND TO CUT COSTS OBVIOUSLY WE INPUT AND HEAVILY INTO THIS REPORT LAST WEEK AND THEN AGAIN YESTERDAY HAVE BEEN UP THEM SOUTH YORKSHIRE LOOKING AT ALTERNATE ROUTES NEXT WEEK I'LL PUT OUT A REPORT CONFIRMING A REVISED ROUTE WHICH DOES SAY SUBSTANTIAL MONEY THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE KNOW THAT ALREADY THAT'S WHY THEY'RE FLYING IN THIS COS IT NO WERE VERY FOUND SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS IN THE ROOT ALIGNMENT
AND THE SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS MEAN WHAT THAT SHEFFIELD IS A SPUR RATHER THAN A NEW STATION IN NOW IF IT DOES MEAN THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S NOW AND I SPENT YESTERDAY WITH ALL THE LEADERS OF THE LOCAL SOUTH YORKSHIRE REGION WE'VE WORKED THROUGH A SOLUTION THAT'S BETTER FOR THE COMMUNITIES TO BE SERVED BY THE RAILWAY AND THE SAVING WHICH IS WHAT HOW DOES IT DIFFER
WE'RE NOT DISCLOSING IT TODAY BECAUSE FIRST THEY WERE WORKING THROUGH WITH COMMUNITIES AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS AS THE BEST WAY OF COMMUNICATING IT TO COMMUNITIES I KNOW YOU BULK AT THE WAY I PHRASED IT BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO READ THIS AS ANY OTHER WAY THAN THERE ARE SAVINGS OF SEVEN BILLION POUNDS THAT NEED TO BE FOUND NOW YOU MAY SAY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE JUST COME UP WITH IS A SAVING OF SEVEN BILLION POUNDS BUT THAT WOULD SUGGEST IT'S MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL NO IT'S NOT
NO IT'S NOT ALL THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE SOME INK INKLING SOME HINT AS TO HOW YOU MANAGED TO SAVE SEVEN BILLION BY CHANGING THE RATE NOW NO I'M NOT SAYING WAS AGED SEVEN BILLION BY CHANGING WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THIS ORIGINAL ESTIMATE ASSUMES NO EFFICIENCIES NO VENGER VALUE ENGINEERING NO BENEFIT FOR IT BEING A FIFTY BILLION POUND THE SCALE SO THE EFFICIENCIES ARE PART OF THE SEVEN BILLION POUNDS OF SAVINGS IN FACT THEY'RE THE LINE THE WROTE DOESN'T CHANGE
THE ROOT HAS HAD MODIFICATIONS ALL ALONG WE'RE STILL DETERMINING THAT WE EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE A DECISION AND THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING NOW HAVING RESOLVED ALL THE MAJOR ISSUES ON PHASE TWO ROUTE WE HOPE THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE A DETERMINATION BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ON PHASE TWO ROOT OH K. THERE YOU HOPE ON THAT AND YOU'RE EXPECTING ROYAL ASSENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR ON PHASE ONE BUT WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EVENT LAST WEEK CORRECT WHICH IS RAISED
ALL SORTS OF UNCERTAINTIES DO YOU FEAR THAT M. PEAS COULD SAY WE'VE GOT A HIT PAUSE ON THIS HUGE PROJECT IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE HAVE LEARNT FROM THE REFERENDUM IT'S NOT TAKE THE MIDLANDS AND THE NORTH FOR GRANTED SO FOR GENERATIONS ARE IVANA INVESTED IN TRANSPORT THE NORTH WE KNOW THAT THERE'S IS NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE H. S. TWO IS ALL ABOUT REBALANCING THE ECONOMY IS PROVIDING JOBS IT'S NOT ONLY MAKING IN THE NORTH THERE TO CONNECT NORTH AND SOUTH IT'S A CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE NORTH OF THE MAJOR CITIES DAVID HIGGINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

WHICH NOW STANDS THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS ARE GROWING EASTERN EUROPEAN BACKLASH AGAINST JEAN CLAUDE YONKERS EUROPEAN COMMISSION CHIEF HIS CONSTANT CALLS FOR MORE EUROPE THE PAPER SAYS ARE BEING BLAMED IN SOME QUARTERS FOR DRIVING THE U.K. TO THE EXIT DOOR
A DAY AFTER THE CZECH FOREIGN MINISTER CALLED FOR MISTER YOUNGERS RESIGNATION THE TELEGRAPH SAYS POLAND ANNOUNCED IT WOULD LEAD AN INFORMAL GROUP WITHIN THE E.U. SEEKING REFORM THE TIMES RECKONS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE COULD BE BANNED FROM THE HEART OF EUROPE AFTER BRECK'S IT NO OTHER STATED RAT HAS REGISTERED IT AS A PRIMARY LANGUAGE THE PAPER SAYS MEANING LEGAL STATUS WILL BE REMOVED

REPORTS OF ENGLAND'S EJECTION FROM EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE HANDS OR FEET OF ICELAND'S FOOTBALLERS READ LIKE A DICTIONARY OF DERISION AND SOME PRETTY GHASTLY PUNS ICE WALLY'S SAYS A HEADLINE IN THE MIRROR ENGLAND CAUGHT COLD BY ICELAND ACCORDING TO THE EYE SOME RECKONS THREE DANCE PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE TINY COUNTRY FAMED FOR ITS FISHING WHAT CODSWALLOP PATHETIC FLOPS OR SAYS THE DAILY STAR THE GREATEST HUMILIATION IN THE TEAM'S HISTORIES THE VERDE IN THE TELEGRAPH
THERE'S LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR THE DEPARTING MANAGER ROY HODGSON FROM THE DAILY MAIL WHICH BIDS HIM GOOD RIDDANCE FINALLY ACCORDING TO THE TIMES AN EATERY NAMED LAST NIGHT AS BRITAIN'S TOP RESTAURANT IS IT SAYS E. GROTTY BOOZER BY THE SEA AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DESCRIBED BY ITS CHEF THE SPORTSMAN IN WHITSTABLE
WHITSTABLE TOOK THE TITLE HEAD OF AN ARRAY OF MORE GLAMOROUS ESTABLISHMENTS OF THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT AWARDS IT'S ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL WHICH PRACTISE SOMETHING CALLED A COOKING WHERE THE MENU IS DETERMINED BY THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE CLIMATE AND SOILS EVEN THE SALT APPARENTLY COMES FROM BOILED DOWN SALT WATER THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
A BRITISH MAN ACCUSED OF HACKING INTO U.S. FEDERAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS FACES AN EXTRADITION HEARING THIS MORNING LARRY LOVE AGE THIRTY ONE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ASPERGER'S AND DEPRESSION HIS FATHER WHO'S A PRISON CHAPLAIN FEARS THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIMSELF IF HE SENT TO AN AMERICAN PRISON AND THE REVEREND ALEXANDER LOVE JOINS US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
OF COURSE YOU ARE DESPERATELY SAD AND WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SON BUT WHAT CREDIBLY LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT FOR HIM TO BE EXTRADITED
ONE OR TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL WE'VE HAD A BIG DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY PUT SOVEREIGNTY AND WE HAVE MADE CHOICES FOR GOOD OR BAD
AND YET WE ALLOW THE AMERICANS TO EXTRA DAY ASKED HER SINCE TO AMERICA BUT DO NOT ALLOW THE MERC NOT ALTHOUGH THERE SIS IS TO BE EXPECTED TO HEAR AS FAR AS I CAN TELL NO AMERICAN SELLERS TO TRIAL IN THIS COUNTRY AND YET MY SON COULD BE TAKEN AWAY AND PUT ON TRIAL THAT'S THE LEGAL OBJECTION
AND ON PERSONAL GROUNDS WHAT IS IT LEAD YOU TO BE SO CONCERNED FOR YOUR SON ON PERSONAL GROUNDS MY SON HAS ASPERGER'S AND HE HAS TO PRESSURED B. ALSO SUFFERS FROM VERY BAD ECZEMA AND ASTHMA WHICH HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
AND THERE AT THE VERY HEART OF ALL HIS HIS EMPHATIC STATEMENT HE WILL KILL HIMSELF NO I KNOW I'M HIS FATHER AND YOU MIGHT SAY I'M BIASED BUT I WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE AT TIMES AND I HAVE A WEE BIT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AFTER THIRTY SIX YEARS AS A MINISTER WHEN LOIS SAYS HE WILL KILL HIMSELF IF HE'S TAKEN TO AMERICA I BELIEVE HIM TO BE STATING SUFFER HE INTENDS TO DO
AND HE NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILY A THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD MAN WITH ALL HIS GIFT AND ALL HIS ABILITY AND YET HE CHOOSES TO LIVE AT HOME BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY PLACE HE CAN FEEL SAFE IF THE AMERICANS HAVE THEY AWAY A WHOLE OCEAN WILL BE PUT BETWEEN US
AND HIM AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE IS KEEP FAMILY CONTACTS
SUCH FAMILY CONTACTS WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE SO YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING THESE ARE SERIOUS CHANCE IT CHARGES YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING THE FACT THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO PURSUE THIS BUT YOU'RE ASKING IN THIS CASE THE CASE OF YOUR SON THAT HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS PUT FIRST NO I THINK I'M DISPUTING IT AS MUCH AS IT IS UNFAIR THAT WE HAVE A TREATY WHICH IS SO ONE SIDED IF IF THE AMERICANS SAY THEY WERE NOT ALTHOUGH THEIR CITIZENS TO BE TAKEN AWAY WITH FOLK
EVIDENCE BEEN PROVED IN AMERICA BECAUSE COS SHE'S NO RIGHTS SHALL WE START THAT SAME STATEMENT HERE ARE YOU INSPIRED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE CAMPAIGN TO STOP THE EXTRADITION OF GARY MCKINNON
A FAINT HOPE IT AND I HOPE THAT EM THAT PRECEDENT WILL BE SET AND LAW
SO YOUR HOPE NOW RESTS ON WHAT ON THE HOME SECRETARY INTERVENING ON MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT COMING TO YOUR AID AND ARGUING YOUR CASE NO FROM WHAT I GATHER NOW THAT THE THE LAW MUST BE WORKED OUT BY THE JUDGE AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY THAT THE HOME SECRETARY NO LONGER HAS ANY SAY IN THAT WAY HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENT TREATY SHOULD BE PUT INTO A IT'S UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A BETTER TREATY IS PRODUCED WHICH IS MORE FAIR
IF WE HAD AN ARREST WARRANT IN IN EUROPE THAT ALLOWED JEREMY TAKES THREAT OUR CITIZENS BUT WE COULDN'T GET THERE WE WOULD SOON BE ANNOYED WHY DO WE DO THIS WITH AMERICANS AND SO YOUR YOUR LAST HOPE SPECIFICALLY FOR YOUR SON AS AGAINST THE CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR THE FUTURE IS IN THIS EXTRADITION IS NEXT TWO DAYS YES IN THE HEALING THAT THAT I WILL PROVE THE LAST TWO DAYS IS THAT
THAT THE JUDGE WILL SEE THAT LOW RES WELLBEING AND THE DUTY OF CARE WE HAVE AS A NATION TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE WILL OVERRULE
ANY NEED TO PLATE THE AMERICANS IN THIS MATTER THE REVEREND ALEXANDER LOVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING US THANK YOU IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND IN A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS MONA DICKIE HE'S PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES AT NEW COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
IT'S EASY TO FEEL DISMAYED CONFUSED AND ANXIOUS OVER WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING AND OUR POLITICAL LIFE AT THE MOMENT NOT ONLY IS THERE A REAL SENSE A POLITICAL VACUUM BUT SOME HAVE MADE A CHARGE A MORAL VACUUM AS MANY POLITICIANS SEEM TO BE TOO BUSY JOSTLING FOR THEIR OWN POSITIONS IN THIS RAPIDLY UNSETTLING ENVIRONMENT
AS THE RHETORIC OF SEISMIC SHIFTS CONTINUES POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN GIVEN PLENTY TO CHEW OVER BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED FOR THEIR FUTURES THIS NEW WORLD IS CREATING SOMETHING AKIN TO AN EXISTENTIAL ANGST AROUND CULTURAL IDENTITY AND BELONGING
BUT RATHER THAN FEEL DISENFRANCHISED FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS PRECISELY THE TIME TO BE MORE POLITICALLY ENGAGED ONE PERSON I SPOKE TO RECENTLY DISMISSED BRITISH POLITICS AS A WHITE MAN'S GAME IN WHICH HE FELT HE HAD NO STEAK AND NO VOICE
EXCEPT THAT WE ALL DO HAVE A VOICE AND DESPITE THE FRAGMENTATION OF CERTAIN STRUCTURES THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO LOSE HOPE
RATHER THAN JUST WITH THE RESULT WE HAVE TO VALUE THE SYSTEM AND PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY FOR ALL ITS LIMITATIONS IS STILL A FORCE FOR GOOD WHEN HE PUTS PEOPLE BEFORE PERSONAL GAIN
IF A VISIONARY LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT SO IS PERSONAL ENGAGEMENT
THE MISTAKE WE OFTEN MAKE IS TO THINK THAT POLITICS IS ABOUT POLITICIANS WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT CITIZENS IT'S ABOUT OUR LIVES WITHOUT ENGAGEMENT SO MANY CHANGES OF THE LAST FEW DECADES WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
FEMINIST MOVEMENTS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY RACE RELATIONS ACTS GAY RIGHTS AND ALL KINDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATIONS WHICH HAVE ENHANCED OUR DIGNITY AND FREEDOMS IT'S NOT THE TIME TO LOSE FAITH IN POLITICS IT'S A TIME TO REKINDLE OUR FAITH
FOR ME ENGAGEMENT IS ABOUT KEEPING HOPE ALIVE AND KEEPING HOPE ALIVE IN THE MIDST OF SO MUCH AND CERTAINTY IS A CIVIC BUT ALSO A RELIGIOUS DUTY
I SEE THIS IN THE WAY I THINK OF WORSHIP I CAN'T THINK OF GOD ON THE BASIS OF FEAR AND ALL ALONE BUT RATHER HOPE THIS ISN'T BECAUSE HOPE WIPES OUT FEAR BUT IT CAN LEAD US TO A CALMER MORE GENEROUS PLACE INSIDE OUR CELLS AND IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS
MANY ARE BEGINNING TO CONDEMN DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT WITH A CYNICISM THE TO CHURCHILL'S WORDS THE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST DEMOCRACY IS A FIVE MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH THE AVERAGE A VOTER
AND YET WHEN WE SEE HALF THE WORLD STRUGGLING EVEN DYING IN THEIR HOPES FOR MORE FREEDOMS WE SHOULD BE REMINDED OF JUST HOW PRECIOUS OUR DEMOCRACY IS
EVEN IF IT LEADS TO INSTABILITY OR TO CONTEST A DECISIONS THE SYSTEM KEEPS PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE
AND HOWEVER HOWEVER MUCH WE THINK OF IT AS BROKEN OR DISTANT WITHOUT OUR OWN ROBUST ENGAGEMENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RE IMAGINE BETTER WAYS OF BEING HOPING AND LIVING
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH MONA SIDDIQUI IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT CARNAGE HORRENDOUS AWFUL TRAGIC THE WORDS USED BY LABOUR M.P.S TO DESCRIBE THEIR MEETING LAST NIGHT TWO M.P.S WERE IN TEARS WHEN THEY LEFT BY EVERY ACCOUNT IT WAS BRUTAL FOR JEREMY CORBIN WITH M.P.S LINING UP TO TELL HIM HE HAD TO GO MORE THAN FORTY OF HIS TOP TEAM HAVE NOW RESIGNED BUT JEREMY CORBIN IS STILL INSISTING HE WILL NOT GO ON HIS OWN M.P.S WERE VOTE IN SECRET ON A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM TODAY
ROSS HAWKINS IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ROSS THIS MEETING LAST NIGHT SOUNDS EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS AND SOME OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SCENES I HAVE EVER SEEN OUTSIDE ONE OF THESE MEETINGS THEY WERE LINING UP NOT JUST INSIDE IN PRIVATE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BUT OUTSIDE IN FULL VIEW OF REPORTERS CALLING FOR JEREMY CORBIN TO GO WITHIN A FEW METRES OF HIS STAFF WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT ON THE OTHER HAND CORRIDOR KOOS AS THEY SAW IT IT CULMINATES IN JOHN WOODCOCK AND M. P. HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF JEREMY CORBIN
ANGRILY ACCUSING IN AID OF SPREADING LIES IN GIVING A DISTORTED ACCOUNT WHICH WAS REJECTED OR IN FRONT OF JOURNALISTS NOW IT IS TRUE THIS MORNING TO SAY SOME ON THE LEFT ARE LOSING PATIENTS ONE SIGNIFICANT FIGURE FROM THAT WING OF THE PARTY TOLD ME THE LEADERSHIP REGARDED LABOUR ITSELF AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN A BIGGER PLAN TO RESHAPE THE HARD LEFT YOU WILL SEE MORE RESIGNATIONS TODAY THE VIEW FROM JEREMY CORBIN SEE IS VERY SIMPLE IF THEY WANT TO CHALLENGE THEY SHOULD BRING ON A FORMAL CHALLENGE
JEREMY CORBIN WILL STAND AND JEREMY CORBIN WILL WIN AND ALL THIS WENT ON WITH THIS HUGE PROTEST OUTSIDE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN A LONE ANTIQUE CORBIN PROTESTER MET ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF PRO CORBIN CAMPAIGNERS AND I THINK THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM SUMS UP MANY OF THE REALLY QUITE PROFOUND SPLITS NOW THREATENED TO TEAR THIS PARTY APART
PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO COME ALONG YOU THINK OH I'M I'M A SOCIALIST YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT YOU'LL ALERTS A LEFT LEANING CONCERT SMALL SHAKEN
YOU'RE BY NO MEANS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE JEREMY CORBIN THE PEOPLE OF THIS PART AND WHAT THEY HIT WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR WHAT THEY STAND FOR OR WHAT THEY REPRESENT YOU IN THE WRONG PLACE I WOULD IT FOR YOU IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE TONIGHT WELL I THINK THIS GENTLEMAN'S APPROACH JUST JUST MEANT WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION
IT'S THAT KIND OF POLITICS THAT LOST AS THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THE KIND OF POLITICS OR A LABOUR PARTY CAN'T COMMUNICATE AS ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE AND A SNAP SUPPORT SHOWED SUPPORT
TO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO RECORD A COVERT IS LEADER BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE WE BELIEVE THAT HE'S THE MAN FOR THE JOB YOU'RE THE SINGLE LONE VOICE HERE WALKING ROUND WITH YOUR RESIGNED PACK DIDN'T THEY LIKE MOST PEOPLE WERE IGNORING YOU AND WALKING AWAY FROM ME BECAUSE YOU DID YOU
THE RIGHT WING OF THE PARTY IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR IT'S NOT WHAT LABOUR ONCE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED PEOPLE ON A SQUARE IS NOT THE SAME AS SIXTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN BRITAIN THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AND THEY THINK VERY DIFFERENTLY
ROSS HAWKINS THERE WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE FORMER MINISTER MARGARET HODGE WHO PROPOSED TO TODAY'S MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE LABOUR LEADER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW THE CHARGE AGAINST YOU IS THAT LOOK YOU'RE USING WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REFERENDUM AS AN EXCUSE YOU'VE WANTED TO GET HIM OUT OR NOT WELL I THINK THE REACTION LAST NIGHT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY WAS UNPRECEDENTED I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE STRENGTH OF FEELING THE OVERWHELMING REJECTION OF JEREMY AS A LEADER
AND THE PLEADING WITH HIM THAT HE SHOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER THIS POSITION GOES DEEP DIGNITY NO ONE INDIVIDUAL IS GREATER THAN THE PARTY DID WE USE THE REFERENCES AND EXCUSE WELL I THINK THE REFERENDUM WAS ACTUALLY A TEST OF LEADERSHIP AND HE FAILED IT HE STARTED TOO LATE
WE WE'RE NOW LEARNING THAT ACTUALLY HE WAS DELIBERATELY HALF HEARTED ABOUT IT AND HE UNDERMINED THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN THAT WAS AT THAT WAS BEING RUN BY ALAN JOHNSON I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE MUDDLED MESS YOU KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT AT THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY ALAN JOHNSON SAID THAT NOBODY FROM THE LEADER'S OFFICE EVER ATTENDED
AT THE WEEKLY MEETING OF THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN FOR REMAIN AND THAT THERE WERE MESSAGES PUT OUT BY THE LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT CONTRADICTED THE MESSAGES THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN MADRID THE THIRD THING IS THAT ACTUALLY THE MUDDLED MESSAGES
ALL HAVE IF WE'D HAD THAT STRONG EFFECTIVE DECISIVE LEADERSHIP I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE
HE THOUGH HAS A DUTY TO THOSE WHO HE HAS BROUGHT INTO THE PARTY NOT LEAST THE TENS OF THOUSANDS WHO IF HE STANDS AND HE SAYS HE WILL IN ANY LEADERSHIP CONTEST WILL VOTE FOR HIM AND HE WILL WIN
I LOOK AT THE PICTURES THE DEMONSTRATION LAST NIGHT THOSE WEREN'T LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIALIST WORKERS' PARTY WHICH IS AN EXTREME LEFT GROUPING AND THEY WERE MEMBERS OF MOMENTUM WHICH IS ALSO AN EXTREME LEFT GROUPING AND THEN WE SAID TWO THINGS ONE IS I WAS HAD BEEN AGAIN AMAZED AT MY EMAILS I THOUGHT I WOULD GET A CHAT BY MOMENTUM I THOUGHT I'D GET HER
TRAIL OF ABUSIVE EMAILS ACTUALLY I HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF EMAILS FROM LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS FROM LABOUR SUPPORTERS ASKED ME TO PURSUE WHAT I'M GOING IN THE SECOND THING IS
THE LABOUR PARTY IS ABOUT NOT LOOKING AFTER THE FEW LOOKING AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THE MANY THERE ARE PERHAPS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS EVEN IF HALF OF THOSE SUPPORT JEREMY HIM CORBIN THERE WERE NINE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED LABOUR AT THE LAST ELECTION IT'S THEIR INTEREST RATES HAVE TO SERVE AND IF WE ARE TRUE
HAVE A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS SO CRUCIAL AT THIS CRITICAL TIME OF THE COUNTRY WHEN OUR PEOPLE WILL FEEL THE BRUNT OF THE CHANGES THAT COME WITH BREAKFAST
SHOULD WE HAVE TO EVEN SPREAD OUT AND GET YET MORE PEOPLE AND TIME OF TIME LAST NIGHT IN PEACE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM EVERY WING OF THE PARTY WERE SAYING JEREMY IS A PROBLEM ON THE DOORSTEP WHO IS THE SOLUTION WHO WILL BE MORE EWAN UNIFYING THAN HERE I THINK THE FIRST THING IS A PLEA
ACTUALLY JEREMY TO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WE ALL KNOW DECENT MEN DO CONSIDER HIS POSITION AND RESIGN WITH DIGNITY I THINK THAT'S THE GREATEST AND DOESN'T WILL IT SPLIT THE PARTY
I THINK WE HAVE TO SHAKE THIS A STEP AT THE TIME WE HAVEN'T HAD THE VOTE VOTE YESTERDAY I WOULD PLEAD WITH HIM YOU'RE SEEING DYING ABBOT LATER ON THEM THIS MORNING AND HE'S A FRIEND OF HIS I THINK THIS IS THE TIME WHEN FRIENDS SHOULD COME UP TO THE MARK AND ACTUALLY SAY WHAT IS IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS NOT OF ONE IN YOUR FRIDGE YOU'LL NOT HAVE ANY EGO THIS IS THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PARTY AND BECAUSE OF THE PARTY IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY COUNTRY NEEDS STRONG OPPOSITION
AND A CLEAR BUT MANY CLEAR WHAT ROUTE FORWARD WERE WE TO SUCCEED IN COMING BACK INTO GOVERNMENT MARGARET HODGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT JOHN HAMMOND IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER JOHN
NICK FORTY YEARS AGO TODAY DURING THE LONG HOT SUMMER OF SEVENTY SIX BRITAIN MCWATT ITS HIGHEST EVER JUNE TEMPERATURE THIRTY SIX DEGREES WOULD BE LUCKY TO REACH SIXTEEN DEGREES TODAY IN SOME PARTS OF THE U.K. YES IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY GREAT OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS

FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND ALREADY A FEW SHOWERS KNOCKING ABOUT OUT WEST AND IT WILL BE A SHOWERY DAY SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS QUITE PROLONGED AT LEAST ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND WILL BE SOME DRIER SPELLS THOUGH NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SUNSHINE IT WILL BE A COOL ONE TEMPERATURES AROUND ABOUT THE MID TEENS AT BEST
ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND AT THIS EVENING ALTHOUGH IT'LL BRIGHTEN UP THERE'LL BE SOME VERY GUSTY WINDS WATCH OUT FOR THOSE THOSE WILL DIE DOWN THEN OVERNIGHT IT WILL BE QUITE CHILLY AGAIN BY THE EARLY HOURS DOWN TO SINGLE FIGURES AND THEN GUESS WHAT TOMORROW AFTER A BRIGHT START MORE RAIN WILL BE SPREADING ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE UK

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES LABOUR M.P.S HAD TO GIVE THEIR VERDICT ON JEREMY CORBIN'S PERFORMANCE AS LEADER IN A SECRET BALLOT THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAS CALLED FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ON THE TERMS OF BRITAIN'S EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS SAID HE WON'T STAND IN THE CONTEST TO REPLACE DAVID CAMERON BECAUSE HE CAN'T UNITE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
AND ENGLAND ARE SEARCHING FOR A NEW MANAGER AFTER BEING KNOCKED OUT OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN BY ICELAND THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET LABOUR M.P.S WILL VOTE TODAY ON A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN JEREMY CORBIN ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF HIS FRONT BENCH TEAM HAVE QUIT IN PROTEST AT HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS ROLE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT MISTER CORBIN FACED CALLS TO RESIGN AT A FRACTIOUS MEETING OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LABOUR PARTY
SHADOW JUSTICE MINISTER ANDY SLAUGHTER IS THE LATEST MEMBER OF THE FRONT BENCH TO STAND DOWN HE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK MISTER CORBIN WAS THE BEST PERSON TO MAXIMISE THE PARTY SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRY BUT THE LABOUR LEADER HAS MADE CLEAR HE HAS NO INTENTION OF GOING AS A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG REPORT
JEREMY CORBIN'S DEFIANCE HAS BEEN BUILT ON HIS INSISTENCE THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF LABOUR M.P.S WHO HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN HIM ARE TRYING TO UNSEAT HIM IN WESTMINSTER AND THAT HIS POSITION IS BUTTRESSED BY OVERWHELMING SUPPORT AMONG THE PARTY AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT WITH ONLY HOURS UNTIL A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP AT WESTMINSTER THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HE'S BACKING AWAY FROM PARLIAMENT COULD BE STARTING TO FRAY
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FRONT BENCH ANDY SLAUGHTER HAS JUST JOINED DOZENS OF OTHERS IN RESIGNING BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT MY SLAUGHTER DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A COMRADE OF MISTER CORBIN AND DECIDED TO GO ONLY AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS WHO AGREED HIS DISQUIET CANNOT BE DISMISSED AS THE GRUMBLING HAVE AN M. P. FROM A VERY DIFFERENT WING OF THE PARTY AND I UNDERSTAND HE ALSO TURNED DOWN A PROMOTION TO THE SHADOW CABINET AND QUIT INSTEAD
THE FIRST SENIOR FIGURE IN LABOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW CALLING FOR MISTER CORBIN TO GO DAVE SPARKS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION HAS WARNED THAT IF MISTER CORBIN STAYS LABOUR WILL BE WIPED OUT HE TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT IF THE LEADERSHIP DOESN'T CHANGE AND CHANGE COURSE THE PARTY IS LOOKING AT ITS SUPPORT DISAPPEARING IN ENGLAND AS IT'S GONE IN SCOTLAND BUT LAST NIGHT A SPOKESMAN FOR JEREMY KORBEN SAID HE HAD NO INTENTION OF RESIGNING
THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HAS CALLED FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ON THE TERMS OF THE U.K.'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION HE SUGGESTED A DEAL BE NEGOTIATED AND THEN PUT TO VOTERS THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS RULED OUT STANDING IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST BECAUSE OF HIS SUPPORT FOR THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
JEREMY HUNT IS THE FIRST CABINET MINISTER TO GO PUBLIC WITH CALLS FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ON THE TERMS OF BRITAIN'S EXIT FROM THE E. U. CRUCIALLY HE ALSO CALLS FOR ARTICLE FIFTY THE PROCESS TRIGGERING WITHDRAWAL TO BE DELAYED UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION PUTTING OFF BRITAIN'S EXIT UNTIL POTENTIALLY BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY
MY HUNT SAYS SUCH TIME WILL BE NEEDED TO STRIKE A DEAL GUARANTEEING ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AS PART OF THAT THE U.K. SHOULD BE PREPARED TO REACH A SENSIBLE COMPROMISE OVER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HIS CALL IS CERTAIN TO ALARM THOSE WHO FEAR THE GOVERNMENT COULD BACKTRACK ON THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM MEAN PILE THE CHANCELLOR HAS CONFIRMED HE WILL NOT BE STANDING FOR THE TORY LEADERSHIP
WRITING IN THE TIMES MISTER OSBORNE SAYS I AM NOT THE PERSON TO PROVIDE THE UNITY MY PARTY NEEDS THERE ARE THOUGH AT LEAST SEVEN OTHERS INCLUDING MISTER HUNT WHO ARE CONSIDERING STANDING THEY WILL HAVE UNTIL THURSDAY TO DECLARE WITH A SHORTENED TIMETABLE THE RESULT WILL BE IN NINE WEEKS' TIME EXPECTED TO FAVOUR THE TWO MOST PROMINENT LIKELY CONTENDERS BORIS JOHNSON AND THERESA MAY
DAVID CAMERON TRAVELS TO BRUSSELS LATER TO MEET EUROPEAN LEADERS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE REFERENDUM HE'S EXPECTED TO URGE THEM TO TAKE A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH TO NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. REPORTING FROM BRUSSELS OUR EUROPE CORRESPOND CHRIS MORRIS
OVER THE YEARS DAVID CAMERON HAS COME TO MANY AN E.U. SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS PROMISING TO BATTLE FOR BRITAIN BUT AFTER LOSING LAST WEEK'S REFERENDUM THIS LOOKS SET TO BE HIS FINAL SKIRMISH AND IT COULD BE A HUMBLING OCCASION THERE'S CONSIDERABLE ANGER ACROSS THE E.U. THAT HE CALLED THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT THE PROCESS LEADING UP TO A U.K. EXIT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRAG ON AND ON
E. USE MOST INFLUENTIAL LEADERS ARE PREPARED TO GIVE THE U.K. A LITTLE MORE TIME TO GET ITS NEGOTIATING HOUSE IN ORDER BUT NOT TOO MUCH AND THEY'VE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO INFORMAL TALKS WITH THE U.K. BEFORE ARTICLE FIFTY IS INVOKED
THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN E.U. COUNTRIES WILL MEET WITHOUT THE U.K. FOR THE FIRST TIME TOMORROW AFTER MORE THAN FORTY YEARS THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER WILL SUDDENLY NO LONGER BE AT THE TABLE IT ISN'T OUTCOME THAT EVEN ONE WEEK AGO FEW PEOPLE EXPECTED
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON WILL SEE CROSS PARTY SUPPORT FOR HER EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE COUNTRY REMAINS IN THE E.U. THE S.N.P. LEADER WILL MAKE A STATEMENT TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT BEFORE AN EMERGENCY DEBATE TAKES PLACE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE REFERENDUM FOR SCOTLAND THE DETAILS FROM A SCOTLAND EDITOR SARAH SMITH NICOLA STURGEON SAYS IT IS DEMOCRATICALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR SCOTLAND TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE E.U. AGAINST ITS WILL AND SHE'S DETERMINED TO EXPLORE EVERY AVENUE TO TRY TO RETAIN SCOTLAND'S Y. YOU STATUS
SHE'LL ASK THE HOLYROOD PARLIAMENT TODAY TOBACCO AS SHE PURSUES DISCUSSIONS WITH E.U. INSTITUTIONS ABOUT PROTECTING SCOTLAND'S PLACE INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION ALREADY SHE'S AGREED TO TALKS WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. THAT VOTED TO REMAIN NORTHERN IRELAND LONDON AND GIBRALTAR
MY SURGEON ALSO WANTS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND REMAINING INSIDE THE E.U. SHE HAS NOT YET COMMITTED TO HOLDING A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE BUT SHE DOES SAY SHE THINKS IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY
ASIAN STOCK MARKETS HAVE RALLIED AND STIRLING HAS STRENGTHENED SLIGHTLY AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE EM THE NICK EH IN JAPAN IS UP BY HALF OF ONE PER CENT IN PART BECAUSE OF EXPECTATIONS OF STIMULUS MEASURES BY CENTRAL BANKS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE U.K.'S LEAVE VOTE

I THINK THE BIG THING ABOUT THE REPORT AS I SEE IT AS SAYING STEADY PROGRESS FROM IN THE FIRST REPORT THREE YEARS AGO SAID WHY ARE YOU BUILDING THIS PROJECT NOW IT'S SAYING I'VE GOT IT I UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGIC CASE SETS REALLY CLEAR IN SAYING THE TIME TABLE IS TIED HER OR WHAT I'M SAYING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PRO JOKE IS THAT WE KNOW THE PROJECT CAN BE DELIVERED IN THAT TIME WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS COULD YOU SAVE MONEY BY EXTENDING IT BY UP TO A YEAR IN WHICH WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'LL LOOK AT THAT
THE FATHER OF A MAN ACCUSED OF HACKING INTO SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND STEALING INFORMATION HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME HE FEARS HIS SON WILL KILL HIMSELF IF HE SENT FOR TRIAL IN AMERICA LARRY LOVE HE'S THIRTY ONE AND FROM SUFFOLK HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AS BURGERS AND DEPRESSION HIS FATHER THE REVEREND ALEXANDER LOVE ADDED THAT HE THOUGHT THE U.K.'S EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S. WAS UNFAIR AS NO AMERICAN CITIZEN COULD BE EXTRADITED
A TWO DAY HEARING TO DECIDE IF HIS SON SHOULD BE EXTRADITED BEGINS THIS MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NAIL IT IS COMING UP TO TEN PAST EIGHT THE POUND HAS PLUMMETED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN THIRTY YEARS THE STOCK MARKET IS DOWN TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE BLACK WEDNESDAY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO
BUT OTHERS MIGHT RESPOND TO HIM THAT THIS WAS AN E.U. REFERENDUM THAT NEVER HAD TO BE HELD IT WAS PURELY A POLITICAL CHOICE MADE BY THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE GOVERNMENT IT WAS A GAMBLE BY HIS FRIEND THE PRIME MINISTER TO HEAD OFF THE RISE OF UKIP AND IT IS A GAMBLE THAT HAS NOW GONE TERRIBLY WRONG NOT JUST FOR MISTER CAMERON HE'S QUITTING BUT ALSO FOR MISTER OSBORNE WHO ANNOUNCES TODAY THAT HE WILL NOT SEEK TO BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THIS COUNTRY
AS FOR THE COUNTRY ITSELF WE MAY NOT KNOW FOR MANY YEARS WHO WAS WON AND WHO HAS LOST AS A RESULT OF LAST WEEK'S VERDICT THE CHANCELLOR JOINS ME FOR HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THAT RESULT IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING CHANCELLOR GOOD MORNING FOR JOINING US
DO YOU NOW REGRET HAVING A REFERENDUM THAT WAS UNNECESSARY AND FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID A PRICE BUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY MORE IMPORTANTLY WHO FEAR THAT THEY ARE PAYING THE PRICE LOOK I CERTAINLY REGRET THE OUTCOME BECAUSE I THOUGHT PASSIONATELY TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. AND I WARNED OF THE ECONOMIC RISKS IF WE LEFT THE IT
BUT I TAKE A SIMPLE ATTITUDE WHICH IS MY COUNTRY RIGHT OR WRONG AND I AM NOW GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP PROVIDE THE COUNTRY WITH A PLAN IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A REFERENDUM ON NOT THAT WE MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO RESOLVE THIS UNCERTAINTY WHICH HUNG OVER BRITAIN FOR DECADES AND IT WASN'T IF YOU LIKE A DECISION OF POLITICIANS AS YOU PUT IT NICK IT WAS A DECISION OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
AT THE GENERAL ELECTION A YEAR AGO AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE ATTITUDE WHICH IS HERE THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE A MISTAKE WE NEED TO ELECT A NEW PEOPLE IT WAS A DECISION THAT YOU TOLD THE PRIME MINISTER NOT TO TAKE BRIBES
WE HAD A BIG AND LIVELY DEBATES ABOUT IT INSIDE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BUT YOU ADVISED WHAT THAT I SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT WE COLLECTIVELY TOOK TO HAVE THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE I COULD SEE THE LOGIC HAVING LOST THE ARGUMENT BECAUSE YOU HAD WARNED THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THIS WAS DANGEROUS AND HE SHOULDN'T DO IT THERE WERE THERE WERE PLUSES AND MINUSES TO HAVING A REFERENDUM BUT I AGREED WITH THE COLLECTIVE DECISION WHICH I WAS HAPPY THEN TO SUPPORT TO ARTICULATE AND TO STAND IN THE GENERAL ELECTION ON TO HAVE A REFERENDUM AND I AM NOT FOR ONE SECOND
RESIGNING FROM THAT DECISION AND I FOR ONE NOT FOR ONE SECOND BELIEVE WE CAN RIZAL FROM SAYING WE'VE GOT TO NOW TAKE THE INSTRUCTION TO DELIVER FROM THE BRITISH PEOPLE VERY SERIOUSLY JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HISTORY BOOKS THOUGH YOU'RE NOT RESIGNING FROM ALL THE ACCOUNTS THAT SUGGEST TO YOU PRIVATELY THOUGHT THIS WAS A BAD IDEA LOOK I'M NOT GOING INTO THE PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN GOVERNMENT BUT I ABSOLUTELY STAND BY THE DECISION TO HAVE A REFERENDUM LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU ARE STILL IN CHARGE OF IT AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE TO BE DEEPLY WORRIED BY WHAT THEY'RE SEEING
THE MARKETS HAVE PLUMMETED DUE THINK AND HOPE THEY WILL ADJUST UPWARDS AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS UNCERTAINTY OR ARE YOU WHEN YOU SAY THIS WILL NOT BE PLAIN SAILING MORNING THE COUNTRY THEY COULD BE WORSE TO COME
WELL LOOK I'M NOT A MARKET SPECULATOR AND MARKETS WERE MOVING IN UP AND DOWN AS YOU COS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT I THINK WE ARE IN A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT FOR THE U.K. WE ARE ADJUSTING TO LIFE OUTSIDE THE E.U. AND IT WILL NOT BE AS ECONOMICALLY ROSIE HAS LIFE INSIDE THE E.U. NOW I THINK WE CAN PROVIDE A CLEAR PLAN AND IT TO MY MIND HAS THREE ELEMENTS FIRST IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL STABILITY
SECOND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RESOLVING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BY DETERMINING WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE TERMS OF TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES WITH THE E.U. INCLUDING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THEN THIRD I THINK COLLECTIVELY AS A COUNTRY UNITING TO REJECT THE INTOLERANT TOLERANCE AND HATRED WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT AGAINST MIGRANT COMMUNITIES WE ALSO HAVE TO ASSERT OUR VALUES AS A COUNTRY AT THIS TIME
WHAT DATE ARE YOU HAVING THE EMERGENCY BUDGET YOU TOLD US JUST LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO THAT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO RAISE TAXES AND CUT SPENDING IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO BE POORER AS A RESULT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ECONOMY WITH THE TRUTH WHEN I KNOWS ABOUT IT WITHIN THAT IS AND YOU KNOW I HAVE IT WHATEVER THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND IT CAN YOU FOLLOWED THESE THINGS VERY CLOSELY I STOOD ALONGSIDE ALASTAIR DARLING MY PREDECESSOR AND SAID THAT IF WE QUIT THE E.U. THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES
AND THE CHANCELLOR WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER TO RAISE TAXES OR TO CUT SPENDING AND I SAID THAT DECISION WHAT HAD TO BE TAKEN IN THE COMING MONTHS I THINK A CRUCIAL THING THAT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED IS PROVIDING FISCAL STABILITY WE KNOW AT A COST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES AND LET'S BE CLEAR YOU'RE SAYING MAYBE THERE WAS NOT THE INSTANT EMERGENCY BUDGET SOME PEOPLE DUBBED IT THE PUNISHMENT BUDGET
BUT YOU THINK YOUR SUCCESS I ASSUME AS CHANCELLOR MAY THIS AUTUMN HAVE TO DO PRECISELY THAT TO CUT SPENDING AGAIN TO RAISE OUR TAXES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY GETS SMALL WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE FISCAL SECURITY TO PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS WE WILL HAVE TO SHOW THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS AS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SIX SEVEN YEARS JUST TRANSLATE THAT MEANS TAX RISES SPENDING YES ABSOLUTELY
BUT THAT DECISION WILL COME UNDER A NEW PRIME MINISTER'S OBVIOUSLY NOT POSSIBLE WHILE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY'S HAVING A LEADERSHIP CONTEST AND WITH THE PRIME MINISTER CORRECTLY SAYING LOOK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO THAT WE COULD DO THAT RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD EXPECT US TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IS THIS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED WHEN WE GET NEW FORECASTS FOR THE ECONOMY FROM OUR OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY IN THE AUTUMN
AT THE TRADITIONAL AUTUMN STATEMENT PERHAPS THEN YES THAT WILL BE A DECISION FOR THE NEW CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT NOW SOME PEOPLE BLAME YOU PERSONALLY FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU DESTROYED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IN THE PROCESS DAMAGE THE TREASURY DAMAGE THE BANK OF ENGLAND BY HARDENING UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC FORECASTS INTO CAST IRON PREDICTIONS
WELL I OBVIOUSLY COMPLETELY REJECT I WOULD SAY THAT THE CONCERNS THAT THOSE LIKE MYSELF WHO ARGUED PASSIONATELY AND FULL THROTTLED TO REMAIN IN THE ARTICULATED HAVE BEEN STARTED TO HAVE BORNE OUT BY EVENTS NOW THAT SHE'S HERE LISTEN TIM BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD AND THEN YOU CAN RESPOND TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE FORMER GOVERNOR MERVYN KING HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY
IT'S TRUE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE OUTCOME IN ECONOMIC TERMS BUT HE WENT WAY BEYOND THAT IN MAKING CLAIMS ABOUT THE PRECISE NUMBERS THAT COULD BE USED TO SAY HOW MUCH OUR LIVING STANDARDS MIGHT FOR WE HAD ALL KINDS OF SCARE STORIES AND I WAS STRUCK BY HOW MANY PEOPLE SAID TO ME THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE SCAREMONGERING TACTICS THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO BE TOLD
IF THEY WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE THEY WILL BE IDIOTS IF YOU SAY TO SOMEONE YOU'RE AN IDIOT IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME YOU DON'T NOT LIKELY TO BRING THEM IN YOUR DIRECTION
I THINK MERVYN KING HE WENT ON TO DEFEND HER SUCCESS AS THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS BLAMING YOU IN A FRIGHTFUL SCAREMONGER IN TREATING PEOPLE LIKE FOOLS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT MERVYN WERE SAYING AND I DID HAVE SPOKEN TO MERVYN KING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE GAVE ME BUT LOOK HIS SUCCESSOR MARK CARNEY
AND THE INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE NOT JUST MARK CARNEY ALL SAID CLEARLY THAT THERE WILL BE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK IF WE QUIT THE E.U. THAT WAS FORECAST IF YOU LIKE REPEATED BY EVERY CREDIBLE INDEPENDENT BODY YOU'VE NOW AND THE WAY YOU DO LOOK IT'S IN THE WAY YOU HARD MAKE NONE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN IT MIGHT NOT BUT LOOK
DO I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A POST MORTEM ABOUT WHY THE CAMPAIGN WAS LOST OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WIN WE DIDN'T GET IT ALL RIGHT IF WE GOT IT ALL RIGHT I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE EXPLAINING TO YOU WHY THE POUND HAS FALLEN TO A THIRTY FIVE YEAR LOW DIN ARE BILLIONS OF POUNDS HAVE BEEN WIPED OFF THE BRITISH STOCK MARKET WHAT I'M DOING IS SAYING NOW WE NEED A PLAN AS A COUNTRY
TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF THIS WHILST RESPECTING THE VERDICT OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE FINANCIAL STABILITY NOW HAS THE ENDING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND PROVIDING UNITY AND A SOCIETY WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW ANGRILY DEMANDING TO KNOW ACTUALLY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS WAS THERE NO PLAN OR FOR ONE OF THE OUTCOMES JET A PLAN IF WE REMAINED BUT YOU CALLED THE REFERENDUM WAS IT NOT THE DUTY AS YOU PUT IT OF GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A PLAN FOR BREAKS IT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN AND WE'RE NOW IN THIS
BIZARRE MONTHS LONG INTERREGNUM WHILE WE WAIT TO SEE IF SOMEBODY CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN
I HAVE SAY I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST NONSENSICAL ARGUMENTS THERE'S BEEN ARTICULATED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANS EXTENSIVE CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY CONSEQUENCES OF BRECHT'S IT THAT'S WHY THE BANKS ARE SAFE AND SECURE THAT'S WHY THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PROVIDING LIQUIDITY OF IT'S NEEDED AT THE MOMENT THAT'S WHERE THE TREASURE IS WORKING WITH THE BAG
TO PROVIDE REASSURANCE THE MARKETS AND WE SPENT A LONG TIME PREPARING THOSE PLANS DUE BUT IS NOT OF A BIT OF A FOR WHAT BRITAIN'S NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH HER YOU MIGHT BE AND THE REASON I THINK PEOPLE WILL JUST BRIEFLY THAT WOULD YOU LET ME ON LET ME ANSWER SICKLE LET ME YOU CHOSE TO HAVE THE READY HAVE A LET ME EXPLAIN WHY I THINK IT'S NONSENSE YOU HAVE THE REFERENDUM SO SURELY YOU HAD TO HAVE A PLAN FOR YES AND FOR NO I REMAIN FOR LEAF BUT I WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WHICH YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY ASKED ME
IT WAS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE WHO WANTED TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. TO EXPLAIN WHAT PLAN WE WOULD FOLLOW IF WE QUICKLY ADVIL AS WAS CLEAR THOSE WHO WANTED TO QUIT BUT YOU HAD A WHOLE RANGE OF DIFFERENT VISIONS THERE ARE SOME WHO WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH EUROPE THERE ARE SOME WHO WANT ALL THE BENEFITS OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP WITHOUT ANY OTHER COSTS ARE NOT SURE THAT'S SO REALISTIC
AND OF COURSE THERE WERE MANY SHADES OF OPINION IN BETWEEN WE AS A COUNTRY NOW HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY DETERMINED AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY HAS TO DETERMINE WHICH MODEL WE ARE SEEKING IN TERMS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR NEAREST FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND THAT IS WHAT THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST IS ABOUT AND THERE'S THE CANDIDATE WHO'S ABLE NOW TO ARTICULATE
IN MY VIEW THE CLEAREST CRISP EST VERSION OF WHAT RELATIONSHIP WE'RE SEEKING WHICH IN MY VIEW INVOLVES THE BEST POSSIBLE TERMS OF TRADE FOR SERVICES AND GOODS
IS THE CANDIDATES I THINK CAN LEAD THE COUNTRY THAT CANDIDATE YOU MAY CLEAR THIS MORNING WILL NOT BE YOU COULD SOMEONE WHO ARGUED FOR REMAIN LEAD THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY EH ABSOLUTELY I'M NOT BACKING ANY CANDIDATE AT THE MOMENT
BUT OF COURSE I WAS FULL THROTTLED IN ARGUING FOR AT LEAVING THE THOUGHT I WAS FULL THROTTLE AND ARGUING FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. AND BECAUSE HALF MY PARTY WANTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. I DON'T THINK I CAN BE THE PERSON YOU CAN BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER AT THIS MOMENT I'M JUST SOMEONE REALISTIC ABOUT THAT BIT LESS FULL THROTTLE
IS STILL ARGUED FOR A MEN'S BE MAYBE A LITTLE LOW KEY IN THEIR SUPPORT FOR MIND THEY COULD BAILEY WELL IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES IN THIS CONTEST MY COLLEAGUES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY TO SET OUT HOW THEY WOULD PROVIDE THAT PLAN THAT LEADERSHIP FOR ARE NOT JUST A PARTY BUT CRUCIALLY FOR OUR COUNTRY AT THIS MOMENT
I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FOCUSED OURS CHANCER EXCHEQUER ON THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION THE COUNTRY FINDS ITS AND IS THERE A ROLE FOR YOU IN THE CABINETS OF WHOEVER IS THE FUTURE THAT IS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A DECISION FOR THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER NOT FOR ME TO BE A ZOO VIEW IF YOU THOUGHT YOU NEEDED TO WALL THAT I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP MY COUNTRY AT THIS MOMENT OF NEED TRANCE EXTRACTS THE LAST SIX YEARS I'VE NOW GOT A VERY IMPORTANT JOB TO DO IN THE COMING WEEKS TO PROVIDE REASSURANCE TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS TO BUSINESSES
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PORES THAT HAS HAPPENED IN HIRING AN INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. IS AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE BY ARTICULATING THE NEED FOR A CLEAR PLAN AND WE WILL SEE WHO COULD LEAD A COUNTRY GOING FOR IT YOU MAY TELL ME AS A FINAL QUESTION THIS IS ONE FOR YOUR MEMOIRS
BUT IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT YOU ARGUED AGAINST THIS REFERENDUM IN PRIVATE DO YOU NOW DEEPLY REGRET THAT THIS WAS EVER DONE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS WRITTEN OFF
ALL THE ECONOMIC GAINS THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD OR APPEARS TO AT THE MOMENT IT HAS DAMAGE YOUR REPUTATION IT HAS DESTROYED THE PRIME MINISTER'S HE'S ARE A PART OF YOU AT A PERSONAL LEVEL LOVELY THINGS IF ONLY WE HAD NEVER DONE LESS WELL
I WANT BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. YES
DID I FEAR THE CONSEQUENCES IF WE QUIT YES DELIGHT ARGUE PASSIONATELY FOR THAT IN THE IN THE REFERENDUM ABSOLUTELY I DID AND I HELD NOTHING BACK I CAN'T DO THINGS BY HALF MEASURES AND I'VE MADE MY ARGUMENT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT COURSE BUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY
AS I SAY MY COUNTRY RIGHT OR WRONG I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE IT WORK FOR BRITAIN IN THE DIFFICULT MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD
GEORGE OSBORNE JOHNSON I THINK YOU'RE COMING IN THIS MORNING LISTENING TO THAT OR ECONOMICS EDITOR CAMEL AHMED CLEARLY MOST PEOPLE'S FOCUS IS NOT ON THE UPS AND DOWNS OF WESTMINSTER IT IS ON THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE MARKETS AND WHAT THEY MEAN FOR THEM WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING TODAY
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE A. LITTLE BIT MORE POSITIVE AT THE MOMENT THE POUND THIS MORNING IS A SLIGHTLY STRONGER THE MARKETS OVERNIGHT IN ASIA ARE A LITTLE STRONGER AS THE CHANCELLOR SAYS MARKETS MARKETS GO DOWN IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THING TO SAY BUT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS THIS GREAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AND SO
COMPANIES AND INVESTORS ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT BRITAIN WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE MARKETS DON'T LIE CONCERNED NOT ENRIQUE THE UNCERTAINTY OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FACT IS WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS GOING TO BE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT PRIME MINISTER WILL FOLLOW THE SAME ECONOMIC POLICIES AS THE MAN SITTING TO MY RIGHT GEORGE OR
BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY THIS IS ALL WILD OVERREACTION TO TEMPORARY SHIFTS IN MARKET SENTIMENT FROM AN UNEXPECTED RESULT MERVYN KING AGAIN THE FORMER CHANCELLOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THE MARKETS WOULD SETTLE DOWN THEY'D FIND THEIR WAY THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES OPENING UP AS A RESULT OF BRITAIN NOW BEING FREE TO MAKE FOR EXAMPLE TREE DEALS WITH OTHERS AND BEING UNSHACKLED ENTIRELY FROM A FAILING EURO PROJECT
ALL WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT IS MARKET'S REACTING TO A POLITICAL DECISION TAKEN LAST THURSDAY BY BRITAIN WE WAIT WE DO NEED YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT NICK TO SEE WHAT THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE SAYING WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME DATA SO ON THURSDAY FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS WILL PUBLISH FIGURES ON INWARD INVESTMENT INTO THE U.K. WILL THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK
WE ALL HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE M. FOR MONEY SUPPLY THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CIRCULATING IN THE BRITISH ECONOMY THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND TOMORROW WE WILL HAVE INDICES OF WHAT DO MANAGERS EXPECT WHO RUN BUSINESSES
ARE THEY FEELING BETTER OR WORSE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WHEN WE START GETTING THAT DATA THEN WE WILL KNOW WHETHER THE MARKETS HAVE OVERREACTED AND HAVE SAID THAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE POORER IN THE FUTURE OR ACTUALLY WHETHER THEY HAVE UNDER REACTED AND ACTUALLY BUSINESS PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY INVESTS IN THIS COUNTRY THE PEOPLE WHO CREATE THE JOBS THE PEOPLE WHO PAY OUR WAGES AND OUR INCOMES
ARE THEY ACTUALLY MORE NERVOUS NOW THAN THEY WERE LAST WEDNESDAY COME ON AHMED GOING TO BE BUSY FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST EIGHT WHEN I SPOKE TO THE LABOUR M.P. MARGARET HODGE JUST BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING SHE PLEADED WITH MY NEXT GUEST DIANE ABBOTT DID SHE IS JEREMY CORBIN'S FRIEND SHOULD TELL HIM HE HAS TO GO
HE'S HEARD IT MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM MORE THAN FORTY OF HIS TOP TEAM INCLUDING TWO THIRDS OF HIS SHADOW CABINET FROM THE LABOUR SPORTING MIRROR WHICH HAS THE WORDS GO NOW ON ITS FRONT PAGE AND YOU HEAR IT AGAIN NO DOUBT FROM A SECRET BALLOT OF M.P.S WHICH WILL BE HELD TODAY HE INSISTS HE WILL NOT RESIGN AND WOULD STAND AGAIN IN ANY LEADERSHIP ELECTION WHILE DIANE ABBOTT NOW SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY IS HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AS HIS FRIEND AND HIS POLITICAL ALLY WHAT DO YOU ADVISE HIM
WHAT I WOULD ADVISE IS THAT M.P.S DON'T CHOOSE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY THE PARTY DARTS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY SAD AND APPOINTS A GREAT CRISIS FOR THE NATION
THAT COLLEAGUES HAVE CHOSEN TO KIND OF STAGE JUST THREE RING CIRCUS YOU KNOW WHEN WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE POST BREAGHA IT PROBLEMS WHEN WE SHOULD BE TRAINING ARE GONE FAR AND THE TORIES THE STAGING THIS THREE RING CIRCUS BECAUSE THEY
DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LEADERSHIP ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN OF WINNING A LEADERSHIP ELECTION I WOULD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL BE THRASHED OUT IN THE COURSE THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION BUT THEY WILL ONLY HAVE TO HAVE THAT IF HE DOESN'T STAND DOWN AND AS THE DAILY MIRROR MANY OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT WHILST TEASER
DECENT MAN FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PARTY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY TO USE THE DAILY MIRROR'S WORDS GO NOW I REPEAT FLEET STREET AND THE LABOUR M.P.S AT WESTMINSTER DO YOU NOT CHOOSE THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY THE PARTY THAT'S THAT ON THE WAY TO RESOLVE THIS IS HOW BILLY'S COLLECTION O.K. HOLLY THAT WE'VE GOT TALK ME THROUGH THIS THEN HE WILL THERE THERE'S A VOTE TODAY WHICH WE ASSUME WILL BE SHOW A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE BECAUSE IT SECRET BALLOT AND BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO NOTICE
SO WOULDN'T RUN A PARISH COUNCIL LIKE THAT O.K. SO IF IT WERE A PUBLIC BALLOT YOU DON'T THINK THAT THERE WAS A PUBLIC BAR VIOLET I THINK IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT MISSILE O.K. BUT WOULD IT DO YOU THINK HE'D SURVIVE IT
SORRY DO YOU THINK THAT HE HAD THERE WERE IT WOULD STILL BE A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM EVEN AS PUBLIC PAUL WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THIS VOTES OF NO CONFIDENCE DOESN'T EXIST IN THE RULE BOOK IT HAS NO NO IN A WAY DOESN'T MATTER THIS IS ALL HIS M. PEAS OR MEN TO A HUGE AMOUNT OF HIS M. P. IS IT CUT AND SAYING I'M NOT PREPARED TO SERVE HUNTING WITH RESPECT YOU'RE BEING VERY WESTMINSTER CENTRIC THIS IS ABOUT THE PARTY AND THIS IS ABOUT THE COUNTRY
THE MOST RECENT POLLS SHOW THAT NEARLY SIX PER CENT OF PUTTING UP A STILL SUPPORT HIM AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SMALLEST THING ABOUT HE DIDN'T WORK HARD ENOUGH IN THE EURO REFERENDUM IT TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES DID HUNDREDS OF THE VAN I'M WE'RE MOVING ON FROM THAT I'M CURIOUS WHAT I WANT FROM YOU SOME VISION OF THAT HOW DO YOU SEE THIS WORKING OUT TO THE GOOD OF THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE LET'S THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN YES THEY SAY THERE'S A LEADERSHIP ELECTION AS ONE WOULD EXPECT THERE TO BE SAID HE STANDS
IF HE WINS LET'S SAY HE WINS WHAT THEN THIS CURRENT THREE RING CIRCUS IS NOT FOR THE GOOD OF THE LABOUR PARTY I THINK LEADERSHIP ELECTION IS INEVITABLE
I THINK THIS IF I COULD CHANCE THAT JAGUAR WERE WICKED LEADERSHIP ELECTION AND THEN THE PARTY WILL BE PLEADING WITH THESE M.P.S WHEN THE PARTY HAS SHOWN ITS WILL NOT ONCE BUT TWICE THE PAST ALL THE SAID THEY DON'T HAVE THE LIKES OF ANDY SLAUGHTER WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A COMRADE BUT SAYS AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS LOCAL PARTY ACTIVISTS HE'S SAID HE HAS TO HAVE A GO
THE WAY FORWARD IS A LEADERSHIP ELECTION AND THEN I BELIEVE THE PARTY WERE ONE TEN PEAS TO RALLY BEHIND A LEADER AND SO HE WON'T HAVE DIFFICULTIES AS HE DOES NOW FILLING HIS SHADOW CABINET AFTER THE AT A WIN OR A FUTURE LADIES LEADERSHIP ELECTION PARTY MEMBERS ARE GOING TO LOOK DIMLY AT PEOPLE WHO'VE CHOSEN TO UNLEASH THIS TYPE OF MAYHEM WHEN WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THE POSITION OF THAT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY IN A GENERAL ELECTION AND FAIRS
I CAN ONLY REPEAT YOU'RE BEING VERY WESTMINSTER CENTRIC THA'S ABOUT THE PARTY WHY IN THE PUB WHY IS THAT WESTMINSTER SENTRY COULD BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT M.P.S AT WESTMINSTER SAYING WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHAT THE PARTY WANTS IS FOR M.P.S TO ACTUALLY COME BEHIND THE LEADS AS THE PUDDLES UP TO WIN A GENERAL ELECTION
IT DOES PEOPLE DON'T JOIN THE LABOUR PARTY BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTENT WITH THE STATUS QUO AND WHAT PARTY MEMBERS WON'T IN THE EVENT OF A LEADERSHIP ELECTION IF THE M.P.S TO RALLY BEHIND THE NEW LEADER WHOEVER THAT IS AND CAN JEREMY
CAN JEREMY CORBIN WIN A GENERAL ELECTION OF COURSE WE CAN'T YOU SAID WHOEVER THAT IS JUST THEN
TO ACCEPT THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE JEREMY CLUB NO I'M JUST SAYING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IF YOU'RE ELECTED LEADER OF THE PARTY THE PARTY HAS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT M.P.S WILL RALLY BEHIND YOU THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN THIS TIME HOPEFULLY IF WINS A SECOND TIME THEY WILL ACTUALLY DO THE RIGHT THING AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY TO HIM I THINK FOR THE GOOD OF THE PARTY YOU SHOULD STAND DOWN
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WESTMINSTER M.P.S IT'S ABOUT THE PARTY IN THE COUNTRY DIANE ABBOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME NOW IS HARPER STATE ROB BONNET IS HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS UM NO CHEER THERE I DON'T THINK SO NO CHESHIRE RIGHT ABOUT THAT GOOD MORNING ICELAND TO ENGLAND ONE IN LAST NIGHT'S EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP LAST SIXTY MATCHES RIGHT UP THERE AMONGST THE MOST DESPERATE RESULTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM OF THE RESIGNATION OF MANAGER ROY HODGSON AND I SUPPOSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SPEEDING HE DELIVERED A PREPARED STATEMENT SHORTLY AFTER THE FINAL WHISTLE

SOME YEARS AGO SHE LOST A CLOSE COLLEAGUE TO SPLUTTERING MOLTEN LAVA BUT INSISTS THAT VULCANOLOGY DONE CAREFULLY IS NO MORE HAZARDOUS THAN DRIVING ON THE M. TWENTY FIVE I'LL BE TALKING TO HAZEL ABOUT THE JOYS AND FRUSTRATIONS OF DOING FIELD WORK ON THE SIDE OF A VOLCANO AND WHY SHE LOVES GRAVITY METRE G. FIVE ONE THREE DE JOIN ME IF YOU CAN FOR THE LIFE SCIENTIFIC AFTER THE NEWS AT NINE
LOOK AT THE WEATHER NOW CLOUDY WITH RAIN FOR MANY SUNSHINE AND SHOWERS FURTHER NORTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE WITH TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM NEIL SLEET OR CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS RULED HIMSELF OUT AS A CANDIDATE TO BE THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER HE SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A REMAIN M. P. TO BECOME LEADER BUT AS HE HAD CAMPAIGNED FULL THROTTLE HE WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO BRING THE PARTY TOGETHER
HE ALSO TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT BRITAIN'S ECONOMY WOULD NOT BE AS ROSY WITH THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE E.U. ASKED IF THEY WOULD BE TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS HE SAID ABSOLUTELY
LABOUR M.P.S WILL VOTE TODAY ON A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN DOZENS OF HIS FRONT BENCHERS HAVE RESIGNED IN PROTEST AGAINST HIS LEADERSHIP MY CORBIN HAS CALLED FOR UNITY RATHER THAN FACTIONAL MANOEUVRING
DAVID CAMERON WILL MEET FELLOW E.U. LEADERS IN BRUSSELS TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LAST WEEK'S VOTE THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL IS EDDIE EXPECTS MISTER CAMERON TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION IN THE U.K. OVER DINNER WHICH WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A FIRST EXCHANGE OF VIEWS
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX HAS RISEN BY MORE THAN TWO PER CENT IN EARLY TRADING AFTER FALLING HEAVILY SINCE THE REFERENDUM RESULT THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE SAYS THE PROPOSED HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK H. S. TWO MAY HAVE TO BE DELAYED TO CUT COSTS THEY DESCRIBED THE TIMETABLE WHICH INCLUDES A TARGET OPENING DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX FOR THE FIRST PHASE FROM LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM HAS UNREALISTIC
IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER VOTE EITHER A SECOND REFERENDUM OR IN A GENERAL ELECTION ON WHATEVER DEAL THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER CAN SECURE FOR A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. SO SAYS THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HE TOLD ME EARLIER HE'S CONSIDERING STANDING TO BE THAT NEW LEADER AND SAYS
HE WOULD BE TRYING TO SECURE WHAT HE CALLS NORWAY PLUS REMAINING IN THE SINGLE MARKET BUT HAVING MORE CONTROLS ON IMMIGRATION I ASKED HIM EARLIER IF HE COULD REALLY CONSIDER A SECOND VOTE AND HOW WOULD IT WORK
WE ARE LEAVING THE E.U. THAT IS THE CHOICE OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE MADE IT WASN'T WHAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO HAPPEN BUT ALL I'M SAYING IS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SECOND REFERENDUM BUT WHAT WE VOTED ON WAS THAT WE ARE LEAVING THE E.U. BUT WE DIDN'T VOTE ON THEIR TERMS
OF OUR DEPARTURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE AND I THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT NOW IS A VISION FOR WHAT
OUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE LIKE OUTSIDE THE E.U. AND A PLAN TO GET THERE AND WHAT I'M SAYING THIS MORNING IS THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING WHICH HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE THAT IS VITAL TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT DEPEND ON TRADE WITH EUROPE WE'RE ONE OF THE GREAT TRADING NATIONS OF THE WORLD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND WE NEED TO KEEP THAT
AS PART OF OUR DESTINY BUT WITH SOME SENSIBLE MIGRATION CONTROLS SO I CALL IT A NORWAY PLUS MODEL WE WANT THE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THE NORWAY HAS BUT WITH SOME SENSIBLE CONTROLS ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT THAT DEAL IS NOT ON THE TABLE AT THE MOMENT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO GET IT AND THAT'S WHY WE MUSTN'T RUSH TO GET ARTICLE FIFTY
GET IT SET UP BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE GOT A GOOD DEAL
BEFORE WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY AND THEN WHAT I'M SAYING IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY I DO THINK THAT DEAL NEEDS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF DEMOCRATIC ENDORSEMENT MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE PART OF THE CONSERVATIVE MANIFESTO FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION SO IT'S YOU YOU PUT IT AS PART OF THEIR MANIFESTO RATHER THAN US ANOTHER REFERENDUM I THINK IT JUST NEEDS SOME KIND OF DEMOCRATIC ENDORSEMENT AND THE REASON THAT I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL GET A BETTER DEAL FROM THE EUROPEANS
IF WE DO IT THAT WAY THEY DID THE DEAL FOR COUNTRIES IS IF YOU WANT A FULL UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET THEN YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT YES AND WHAT I SET OUT THIS MORNING IS MY REASONS WHY I THINK WE CAN GET THERE BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME AND MY REASON IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT THIS ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE FOR US IT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE GERMAN ELECTRIC FOR THE DANISH LECTURE FOR THE DUTCH ELECTORATE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GENERAL ELECTIONS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY NEXT YEAR
AND THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN EUROPE IS CHANGING VERY FAST AND IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE DENMARK FOR EXAMPLE HAS TO COPE WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIANS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN GERMAN PASSPORTS BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. SO I THINK
THE DESIRE TO CHANGE THOSE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT RULES IS IN THE EUROPEAN INTEREST AS WELL AS THE BRITISH INTEREST BUT WE NEED TO GIVE IT SOME TIME AND THEREFORE WAY BEFORE WE INVOKE ARTICLE FIFTY WHATEVER DEAL YOU GET YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO VOTE FOR IT WE COULD BE IN A WORSE SITUATION THEN THAN WE ARE NOW THERE WERE MANY SHOCKS LAST WEEK BUT ONE OF THE HEALTHIEST THINGS WE DID WAS LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE
AND THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IN THIS COUNTRY THEY ARE SOVEREIGN AND I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HAVING EXERCISE DEMOCRACY IN THAT PROFOUND WAY THAT WHEN WE TAKE THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS THE TERMS OF OUR LEAVING THE E.U. FINALISING THOSE TERMS THAT TOO HAS SOME DEMOCRATIC ENDORSEMENT AS I SAY MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE
THROUGH A GENERAL ELECTION BUT SOMEHOW WE NEED TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE SUPPORT THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WE'RE GOING ON AND YOU WILL BE THROWING YOUR HAT IN THE ROW IN THE RING TO BE THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING I HAVEN'T GOT VERY LONG I'VE GOT UNTIL THURSDAY LUNCH TIME TO MAKE UP MY MIND BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED IN PERSONALITIES
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS THAT WHAT I DO WANT TO KNOW WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER IS GOING TO BE IT'S JUST THAT QUITE RECENTLY YOU TOLD US ON THIS PROGRAMME THAT THAT JOB IT'S YOUR JOB AS HEALTH SECRETARY WOULD BE YOUR LAST BIG JOCK I SAID IT MIGHT BE MY LAST BIG JOB AND THINGS CHANGE IN POLITICS VERY VERY RAPIDLY AS WE ALL FOUND OUT LAST WEEK JEREMY HUNT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME NOW IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW THE HUMBLE ASPIRIN IS ALREADY KNOWN TO PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS NOT JUST OF COURSE TO CURE HEADACHES BUT NOW RESEARCHES THINKING COULD AT LEAST IN LIQUID FORM HELP TO TACKLE BRAIN TUMOURS DOCTOR KIERAN BREEN IS WITH US HE'S DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT THE BRAIN TUMOUR RESEARCH
LET'S BEGIN WITH WHAT THE PROBLEM IS TO WHICH ASPIRIN MIGHT BE A SOLUTION WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM IN TACKLING BRAIN TUMOURS WELL BRAIN TUMOURS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS NOT MANY FROM PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH THEY CAN BE MANIFESTS BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE NUMBER OF TREATMENTS THAT WE HAVE IS VERY LIMITED
SO PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT ASPIRIN AND DRUGS LIKE THAT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN KILLING THE TUMOUR ITSELF HOWEVER ALREADY KNEW THAT THE LESSON COULD HELP YES NOW THE KEY IS THIS IS IT LIQUID ASPIRIN HELPS IN A WAY THAT PILLS DON'T EXACTLY
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT ME BEYOND THE BOX THE EXISTING ASPIRIN IS NOT SOLUBLE IT ACTUALLY FORMS SUSPENSION AND THAT ISN'T ABLE TO GET INTO THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS COVERED BY A MEMBRANE CALLED THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND THIS PREVENTS A LOT OF DRUGS AND OTHER COMPOUNDS FROM ENTERING SO THE COMPANY THAT WE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PORTSMOUTH HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HAVE ACTUALLY DEVELOPED FORM A FORMULATION OF THE ASPEN WHICH ACTUALLY CAN GET INTO THE BRAIN
AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY KILL THE TUMOUR CELLS SO THIS IS NOT LIKE AS IT WERE THE CLOUDY SUSPENSION THAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR SOLUBLE ASPIRIN IN SOME WATER NO THIS IS DEFINITELY A SOLUBLE FORM YOU WOULD IF YOU LOOK AT THAT IT WOULD JUST LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER FORM OF LIQUID BASED LIKE MORTAR NOW AT THIS STAGE EARLY STAGES I ASSUME WHAT ARE YOU HOPING FOR THAT IT JUST HOLDS BACK THE DEVELOPMENT OF TUMOURS OR THAT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE SOME FORM OF KILL
WELL THAT RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT HAS LOOKED AT CELLS GROWN IN A DISH OF WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT THE SOLUBLE ASPIRIN WILL ACTUALLY KILLED A TUMOUR CELLS WITHOUT HAVING ANY MAJOR EFFECT ON THE NORMAL NERVE CELLS THAT LOOKS TO BE QUITE SPECIFIC FOR KILLING THE CELLS
WE NEED NOW TO GO ON AND DO FURTHER WORK TO SEE IF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE NORMAL BRAIN WHICH HAS TUMOURS AND ULTIMATELY GO ON CLINICAL TRIALS SO IN TERMS OF THE TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE POSSIBLE USE ONE DOESN'T WANT TO RUSH AHEAD BUT THE POSSIBLE USE
OF THE SOLUBLE ASPIRIN MIGHT NOT WHEN MIGHT IT BE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO FURTHER STUDIES USING ANIMAL MODELS OF THE CONDITIONS SO THAT WE CAN SEE IT GETS INTO THE BRAIN HAS A BENT QUITE A FEW YEARS I WOULD SAY BUT IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL GOES ON BUT THEN YOU GO INTO YOU'RE A LONGER STAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VARIOUS FAVOURITES AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THE COST
OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PETITION COMMITTEE HAS SHOWN THAT ONLY ONE PERCENT OF BRAIN OF CANCER FUNDING AS SHE GOES TOWARDS THAT MEN TREATING BRAIN TUMOURS AND THEY HAVE STATED THAT THIS ISN'T SUFFICIENT SO WE NEED MORE INVESTMENT SO THAT WE CAN GET DRUGS LIKE THIS INTO THE CLINIC WELL YOU WILL HAVE BY APPEARING ON THIS PROGRAMME YOU MAY YOU MAY GET A LITTLE BIT MORE ADOPT KIERAN BREEN OF THE BRAIN TUMOUR RESEARCH AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO NINE IT WASN'T JUST THE TOWN AND CITIES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. BUT ALSO THOSE DOWN SOUTH IN COUNTIES LIKE HAMPSHIRE DORSET A REPORTER AT SEA MACA TEXTURE HAS BEEN TO HER HOME TOWN OF BASINGSTOKE TO FIND OUT WHY PEOPLE THEY'RE CHOSE TO LEAVE RATHER THAN REMAIN AND WE SHOULD WARN YOU THAT YOU MAY FIND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN SEAMAN'S REPORT OFFENSIVE
SIFTING THROUGH SOME OLD SCHOOL PICTURES WITH MY FATHER SO RASH
GOSH I WAS ABOUT FIVE YOU AND YOUR BROTHER WITH THAT WORD ALREADY YOUNG FIVE AND SEVEN YEARS OLD AND THEY WERE NOT HER NICK MINORITY OR DEAD IN THE SCHOOL AT THAT STAGE IT'S CHANGED HASN'T IT NO IT IS BECOMING VERY COSMOPOLITAN SITUATION SINCE THOSE DAYS
WE CONTINUE A TOWN WHICH WAS ONCE MONOCULTURAL HAS BECOME MULTICULTURAL OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES NOW MORE THAN ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HERE IS MADE UP OF OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS BESIDES WHITE BRITISH
GOOD LOT HONESTLY GARMENTS WERE TO GET AT THE LOCAL VINE SCHOOL MATHS TEACHER NEIL PUNY SAYS HE'S PUPILS EMBRACE ALL CULTURES AND RELIGIONS CERTAINLY WITHIN WITHIN THE CLASSES WE HAVE STINGS FROM POLAND ROMANIA PAUL HUNGARY LITHUANIA YOU NAME IT ALL OVER YOU AND NON E.U. AS WELL AND THAT HAS INCREASED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM IN THE BOROUGH OF BASINGSTOKE IN DEAN VOTED TO LEAVE ITS RESULTS WERE REFLECTIVE OF THE NATIONAL PICTURE WITH FIFTY TWO PERCENT WANTING ALT AND FORTY EIGHT PERCENT WANTING TO STAY IN SO IMMIGRATION A FACTOR IN HOW PEOPLE VOTED
THE LOCAL PUB A MAN TELLS ME HE'S PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME BECAUSE OF THE RISING NUMBERS OF FOREIGNERS IN THE TOWN IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE HE BEGINS A TWIN RACIAL SLURS TOWARDS ME INCLUDING A WORD THAT ASIAN PEOPLE FIND ESPECIALLY OFFENSIVE I THINK ALDO EMIGRANTS THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EASTERN EUROPEANS LIKE NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT PACKING SOMEONE SAY NOT ALL OF THEM DID YOU SAY PACKING NO THAT MEAN SORRY
I'M NOT AS OFFENSIVE NO I DIDN'T MEAN TO COME ACROSS BUT IF OLA MIGHT NOT FOREIGNERS WILL BLEED TO SAY WE'VE GOT THE SAME HEARTLESS DIFFERENT COLOUR SKIN
DO YOU NOT LIKE ASIANS THAT I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE WORD ON I'LL USE PACK YOU'VE GOT WHICH I'LL COME ON MORE MORE FRONT OF YOU KNOW I MEAN BUT I'M NOT LIKE THAT I'M NOT RACIST AT ALREADY
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS TYPE OF DISCOURSE IS AN OCCURRENCE OF THE REFERENDUM DEBATE I'M TOLD BY THE LADY BEHIND THE BAR THIS SORT OF TALK THE P. WORD IS NOTHING NEW IN THIS
RATHER SHOCKED BECAUSE THAT MAN JUST CALLED ME THE P. WORD A LOT OF PEOPLE DO USE THAT WEAR QUITE FREELY YOU'LL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE WITHOUT MEANING TO SOUND
SKIN COLOURS DIFFERENT NOISE PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT YOU I THINK YOU'RE NOT ENGLISH AND THAT THAT'S THE WAY
IN AN OLD MANOR HOUSE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BASINGSTOKE JEFF BOAT'LL SITS IN A SPA ROOM FACING A FIELD HE'S A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U.
HE SAYS IT ANGERS HIM AND PEOPLE HERE SAY IMMIGRATION ON THE DRIVING FORCE OF THE REFERENDUM FUCK MY VIEW IS THAT IMMIGRATION IS BEING USED BY THOSE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE DECISION THAT HAS BEEN MADE
I JUST HAVE THIS FEELING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE EVERY SO OFTEN EVERY FEW YEARS I CAN
HE LACKED THEM DE SELECT THE PEOPLE AND MAKE THE ROARS LOOK UP MY COUNTRY THE THINK TANK OPEN EUROPE HAS SAID THAT LEE VOTERS ARE A MIX OF LIBERAL GLOBAL LISTS AND UKIP VOTERS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO BE MIRRORED IN THIS TOWN
WITH A POPULATION MAKE UP THAT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE MANY HERE TELL ME THE NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WITH HER HOPE THEIR NEEDS WILL BE PUT FIRST RICHARD IS TWENTY TWO AND VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U.
I FEEL PERSONALLY IT'S BETTER WERE OUT BECAUSE WE CAN JUST SIT DOWN GET WHO THOUGHT
OUR CELLS FIRST INSTEAD OF SOMEONE WHO ISN'T ACTUALLY CARING FOR INTEREST'S TWADDLE
SI MC ATTACH A REPORTING THERE IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE THEY MAYBE NO PLAN FOR LIFE AFTER BRECK SPIT BRECK'S IT BUT THERE IS A PLAN TO SET UP A UNIT TO DRAW UP A PLAN THE PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST CIVIL SERVANTS WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER TO DO WHAT IT SEEMS NO ONE UP TILL NOW HE'S DONE WORK OUT WHAT OUR NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. WILL BE WAS BIG MOMENT OF LORD GUS O'DONNELL FORMER CABINET SECRETARY AS THEY PROFESSOR SHONA DEBORAH SCOTT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT IT
QUEEN MARY'S UNIVERSITY IN LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT WILL NEED TO THE BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST COS THIS IS ONE HELL OF A JOB ISN'T IT INDEED THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ARE HUGE AND ACTUALLY THEY ARE QUITE TROUBLING AND THAT'S EVEN IF WE LEAVE THE DEVOLUTION ASPECTS OF THIS ASIDE TROUBLING IN WHAT WAY
THE WHOLE PROCESS OF THE DOMESTIC DISENTANGLE MONTHS OF THE U.K. FROM E.U. LAW IS GOING TO BE AN ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE MASSIVE PROJECT
NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO REPEAL THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S ACTS BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT E.U. LAW HAS ENTERED NATIONAL LAW IN SO MANY WAYS INTO ACTS OF PARLIAMENT BUT ALSO INTO STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS SO IT IS THE FEAR THAT IF YOU REMOVE THE E. U. ELEMENT OF IT THERE WILL BE GAPS THERE WILL BE GAPS THAT COULD BE PLAYING THROUGH THE COURTS FOR YEARS EXACTLY BECAUSE A LOT OF E.U. LAW IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS DIRECTLY AFFECTED
IT DOESN'T MEET NATIONAL LEGISLATION SO IF WE WITHDRAW FROM THE TREATIES THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE WHOLE AREAS OF OUR LAW CURRENTLY GOVERNED BY THE E.U. WHICH WILL HAVE LUCK WHO KNOW THEY WILL HAVE GAPS WE WILL HAVE KNOWING MORE THAN JUST REPLACE ONE FOR THE OTHER WELL THIS WOULD BE A MASSIVE TASK WE WOULD HAVE TO LEGISLATE IN HUGE DIMENSIONS THAT WOULD BE MASSIVE IT WOULD TAKE UP THE CIVIL SERVICE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WE WOULD NEED TO EMPLOY LOTS OF LAWYERS AT GREAT EXPENSE
LET ME BRING IN HER BEFORE THE CABINET SECRETARY LAW GUS O'DONNELL THIS IS WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE HAS TO BE IN THIS UNIT SET UP
UNDER OLIVER LETWIN IF YOU WERE STILL SITTING THERE AS A DEAD THE TOP OF THE CIVIL SERVANT WOULD YOU RELISH THIS JOB OR FEAR IT OH IT'S A WONDERFUL JOB I MEAN WE THIS IS WHAT THE CIVIL SERVICE TO DEALING WITH CRISES IT'S A COMPLICATED WORLD THEY'VE DONE THIS BEFORE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS POST BLACK WEDNESDAY ALL OF THIS SCALE SURELY
NOW AS WAS POINTED OUT THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THIS IS YEARS RIGHT BUT I SHOULD BE CLEAR THIS IS A CIVIL SERVICE UNIT OLIVER LETWIN IS GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THE EXTERNAL PART AND THOSE CIVIL SERVANTS WILL BE WORKING ON CONTINGENCIES THE PROBLEM THEY'VE GOT IS THAT AS YOU WE HAVEN'T GOD WHAT LEAVE CONSTITUTES
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LEAVES ALL ABOUT WE KNOW THAT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WE'D LIKE TO HAVE MORE CONTROL FOR THE U.K. PARLIAMENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE MIGRATION NUMBERS SO HOW CAN YOU ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT WE ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW THAT POLITICAL DIRECTION FUR AT LEAST MONTHS YES THERE IS PRESUMABLY WORK THEY CAN GET ON WITH TO SAY WELL IF IT'S THIS OR IF IT'S THAT ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK WHAT THEY'LL BE SAYING IS
CAN WE ACHIEVE THE GAY THE THINGS THAT WHEN PEOPLE VOTED LEAVE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT GETTING BACK CONTROL FOR U.K. PARLIAMENT SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DEBATE SHOULD WE HAVE IN PARLIAMENT BEFORE WE TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY I THINK WE NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THAT PARLIAMENT NEEDS TO HAVE A BIG ROLE IN ALL OF THIS I LIKE THIS SORT OF DEBATES THAT COULD GO YOU COULD GET
MONTH THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR FUTURE AND ALSO IT'S NOT JUST THE U.K. PARLIAMENT AND EAT THESE TO THINK ABOUT REFORM I THINK THE E.U. ITSELF THEY'VE GOT A PROBLEM THE EURO AREA NEEDS TO INTEGRATE FURTHER POLITICALLY BUT THOSE OUTSIDE THE EURO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE FOR THERE TO BE A GROUP
THAT DON'T AREN'T MEMBERS OF SHOWING THERE AREN'T MEMBERS OF THE EURO AND DON'T WANT TO BE THAT CAN ACTUALLY CREATE A FUTURE A BIT LIKE THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA WHERE WE GET THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF FREE TRADE WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO HAVE ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS WHICH WE POSSIBLY WHAT WE CLEARLY DON'T WANT AS MUCH CAN YOU SEE A ROUTE THROUGH TO SOMETHING THAT SATISFIES THE LEVERS RESTRICTIONS ON FREE MOVEMENT BUT STILL PART OF SOMETHING APPROXIMATING THE SINGLE I WOULD
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT TO GO FOR I WOULD SEE A WORLD WHERE WE GET WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THE PEOPLE ARE VOTED LEAVE DON'T WANT THE ECONOMIC COSTS IF WE CAN AVOID THEM THEY DO WANT AS IT WERE PARLIAMENT HAVE A BIGGER SAY THEY DO WANT US TO HAVE MORE SAY OVER MIGRATION NUMBERS ACTUALLY MIGRATION IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE OF EUROPE
SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS IF WE CAN GET REFORM FROM THE E.U. SIDE THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS IF THIS WORKS YOU KNOW WHAT ONE CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE A NEW PRIME MINISTER MIGHT BE FACED WITH RATHER DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY ARE THAN DAVID CAMERON AS FACE DOES THAT MAKE A GENERAL ELECTION IN YOUR VIEW ESSENTIAL WELL IF WE GET TO A SITUATION WHERE
A NEW PRIME MINISTER TAKING ACCOUNT OF ALL THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE ARE MADE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL CAN ACTUALLY COME BACK WITH A REALLY GOOD DEAL THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE AS JEREMY HUNT WAS SAYING YOU GET TO A SITUATION WHERE THEY WANT TO PUT THAT TO A GENERAL ELECTION OR TO A SECOND REFERENDUM IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE VOTE NO
THAT LOW THEN THAT THEN IT'LL BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IT WASN'T THAT THE THINGS THAT HACK ME NEGOTIATE WEREN'T WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE SAY ACTUALLY IS AND ABOUT THOSE THINGS YOU SAID IT'S JUST I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THIS Y. YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH
OLD GUTTERED ON PROFESSOR SHONA DOUGLAS SCOTT THANK YOU IT IS FIVE TO NINE ENGLAND ARE OUT OF EUROPE NO NEED FOR A REFERENDUM NO NEED FOR ARTICLE FIFTY NO NEED FOR A EUROPEAN SUMMIT TO DO HIS ICELAND DID IT A TEAM FROM A NATION THE SIZE OF THE CITY OF LEICESTER RUN BY A DENTIST BEAT ROY HODGSON'S MULTI MILLIONAIRE
TEAM OF STARS THE BLAME GAME HAS ALREADY BEGUN OF COURSE AND SOON THE F.A. WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN RATHER LIKE THE POST BRECHT'S HIS PLAN TO DECIDE WHERE AN EARTH WE GO NOW IN WHAT MORE JOINT IS ON THE LINE HE'S A FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE F.A. BUT ALSO HAS EXPERIENCE AS A RUGBY WORLD CUP BOARD MEMBER MORNING TO YOU MY MORNING NICK NOW
LET'S START WITH THE BLAME AND THERE WILL BE MORE POSITIVE AND MOVE ON PLAYERS' MANAGER F.A. WHO DO YOU BLAME I THINK ON THIS OCCASION THE MANAGER HAS TO TAKE THE BLAME THE SQUAD THAT HE ASSEMBLED WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO BEAT ICELAND BUT UNFORTUNATELY
BEGIN HIS GAME PLAN WAS INCONSISTENT HIS SELECTION GAMBLES DIDN'T PAY OFF AND THE PLAYERS FELL APART UNDER PRESSURE IN THE SECOND HALF PARTICULARLY THEY REMINDED ME QUITE A LOT OF THE ENGLAND RUGBY WORLD CUP PERFORMANCE INTACT SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PARALLEL SOME OF MADE IT BETWEEN THE FACT THAT STUART LANCASTER TOOK A GROUP OF PLAYERS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON COULD NOT GET THEM TO PERFORM TO THEIR ABILITIES AND YET A NEW COACH ESSENTIALLY WITH THE SAME GROUP OF PLAYERS EDDIE JONES DID MANAGE TO DO
I DO SEE THAT PARALLEL I THINK IT'S VERY VERY SIMILAR IN BOTH STUART LANCASTER AND ROY HODGSON ARE DECENT PEOPLE DOING THEIR BEST FOR ENGLAND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS THE TOP LEVEL OF COMPETITION AND YOU NEED TOP LEVEL INTERNATIONAL COACHES BUT I'LL DO YOU A LITTLE HORRORS
IF YOU SEE HER YOU'LL BE A LITTLE HARSH WHEN WAYNE ROONEY CANNOT PASS THE BALL AND WE COULD NOT PASS THE BALL YESTERDAY SUCCESSFULLY REPEATEDLY WHEN HARRY KANE WHO FOR TOTTENHAM CAN ENDLESSLY AT LEAST HIT THE TARGET IF NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO GO
WAS FIRING CROSSES THAT WENT OVER THE BACK LINE WAS HITTING FREE KICKS THAT WENT WELL WIDE OF THE GOAL THAT'S NOT THE MANAGER'S FAULT IS IT WELL I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER I THINK THEY FELL APART UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE SITUATION AND THAT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INCONSISTENT SELECTIONS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT THE PRE TOURNAMENT USE OF WAS WAS NOT RIGHT IN MY OPINION
AND AS A RESULT THE TEAM DIDN'T REALLY GEL AS A TEAM AND IT WAS VERY SIMILAR READ BEN YOU'VE SEEN WAY EDDIE JONES CAN DO WITH THE RUGBY PLAYERS I THINK A TOP LEVEL COACH COULD DO THE SAME WITH THIS BUNCH OF ENGLAND PLAYERS COS THERE IS REAL TALENT THERE SOMEONE SORT OF ROY HODGSON RATHER CRUELLY THAT HE MANAGED TO MAKE POOR PLAYERS AVERAGE BUT HE ALSO MANAGED TO MAKE GOOD PLAYERS AVERAGE
AS THAT'S PROBABLY HADN'T WON SO THEY SORT OF OSCAR WILDE TYPE QUOTES BUT I THINK ROY HODGSON DID HIS BEST IT JUST TURNED OUT ON THIS OCCASION I'M NOT TO BE GOOD ENOUGH AND I THINK MARTIN GLENN NOW NEEDS TO SIT DOWN TAKE A REALLY LONG LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS OPEN TO HIM AND TO USE THE ANALOGY TRY AND FIND HIS OWN EDDIE JONES AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE
WELL THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THE STANDOUT CANDIDATES IT DEPENDS A LITTLE BIT WHAT SORT OF MANAGER YOU WANT TO GO FOR IF YOU WANT TO STAY ENGLISH AND EXPERIENCED ANYWAY WELL I JUST SOMEBODY JUST WINCE WITH MINE THAT'S RIGHT SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE YOUNGER MANAGERS OF THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THE BEST FOR THE WINNING AT THE MOMENT ONE HEADY HOWARD HEREFORD BULL MINISTER EXAMPLE GARETH SOUTHGATE
WHO IS THE ESSAYS UNDER TWENTY ONE MANAGER HAS JUST WON THE TWO LONG TOURNAMENT BY BEATING FRANCE IN THE FINAL JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS AGO SO I'M SURE HIS NAME OR COME INTO THE FRAME AS WELL THE MORE EXPERIENCED ENGLISH MANAGERS LIKE SAM ALLARDYCE TONY PEERLESS AND OF COURSE PODGY AND NOT TURN INTO A VETERAN LET ALONE A FOREIGNER LIKE FOR EXAMPLE
WELL I I I THINK THAT MOST OF THE FOREIGNERS HAVE RULED THEMSELVES OUT AND MANY OF THEM ARE JUST ARSING NEW CLUB JOBS LIKE UNITED AND SO ON SO I THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY TRY TO STAY BRITISH US THEY CAN THIS HAVE TO A FIVE TENZING AN ANSWER IF YOU COULD IS THE F.A. CAPABLE THOUGH OF APPOINTING THE RIGHT PERSON WAS IN THE F.A. A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM
I THINK MARTIN HAS TO TAKE PERSONAL CONTROL OF THIS HE CAN GET ADVICE FROM OUTSIDE BUT IT HAS TO BE HIS DECISION ON THE F.A. BOARD HAVE TO BACK HIM AND SEE ANYWAY WE CAN GET THIS DONE IAN WHAT MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I THINK BRICKS IT MIGHT PROVE TO BE A LITTLE EASIER ARE EDITORS TODAY WERE DAVE MCMULLEN NICOLA STAN BRIDGE FROM US ALL GOOD MORNING
