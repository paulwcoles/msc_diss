NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAS SAID THAT THE CURRENT BLANKET BAN SHOULD BE REASSESSED PROFESSOR THANK YOU RAM KRISHAN AND SAYS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS SAFE AND HAS MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS
HE ACKNOWLEDGES HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY THAT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WILL USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MONOPOLISE FOOD PRODUCTION AND THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF VARIETIES OF FRUIT VEGETABLES AND CEREALS

AND IT'S QUITE TENSE AND PLACES IT'LL ONLY BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE'S ENOUGH STRENGTH IN THE SUNSHINE TO BURN THAT AWAY FAIRLY SMARTLY AND THEN ONCE WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING IT'LL BE A VERY DECENT DAY INDEED WOULD BE DRY FOR THE MOST PART THERE SOMETHING OF A NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE NOT OVERLY WARM ON THE COAST TODAY ELEVEN OR TWELVE PERHAPS THE NORTH SEA STILL NOT VERY WARM AT THIS TIME OF YEAR BUT COME INLAND JUST A FEW MILES AND HE'LL BE UP INTO THE MID TEENS AND I'M SURE SOMEWHERE ON THE EASTERN SIDE IS GOING TO SEE AROUND EIGHTY PERHAPS IN THE LONDON AIR AS HIGH AS TWENTY
TOWARDS THE WESTERN SIDE WILL WE WEE BIT OF MISTERS A CHILLY START AS WELL BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S A DRY DAY FOR MANY OF YOU SOME DECENT SPELLS OF SUNSHINE AS WELL JUST ENOUGH IN THE WAY OF CLOUD THIS AFTERNOON PERHAPS FOR THE ODD ISOLATED SHOWER ACROSS PARTS OF THE SOUTH WEST AND ALSO INTO WALES HERE PERHAPS THE BEST OF THE TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE DAY CERTAINLY INTO THE MID TEENS MAYBE AGAIN SOMEBODY GETTING TWENTY DEGREES
FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A DRY BUT CHILLY START HERE TOO PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AROUND CLOUD DEVELOPING THROUGH THE DAY MAY BE AN ISOLATED SHOWER BUT WILL BE THE EXCEPTION TO THE DRY RULE OUT THE EAST SIXTEEN DEGREES SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST AGAIN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR TWENTY FINALLY TO SCOTLAND THE SOUTH WEST SEEING THE VERY BEST OF THE SUNSHINE WESTERN PART IN FOR A PRETTY DECENT DAY AGAIN MAYBE THE ISOLATED THERE'S MUCH MORE CLOUD OUT TOWARDS THE NORTH AND EAST THOUGH THIS WILL TAKE A TIME TO BREAK BUT EVEN HERE WAS HE A WEE BIT OF SUNSHINE AND A HIGH OF EIGHTY
PHIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS IN THE LEAD FOR THE DAILY MAIL HEADLINE READS KNIVES OUT FOR CAMERON TORY THREATENED NO CONFIDENCE VOTE SAYS THE DAILY MAIL AFTER THE P.M.'S SHABBY BRICKS IT'S SCAREMONGERING IS IN THE WAKE OF THE TREASURY A DOSSIER RELEASED YESTERDAY OTHER THE PAPERS AS DOZENS OF TORY M.P.S ARE THREATENING TO TOPPLE DAVID CAMERON OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM
A SENIOR PARTY FIGURES SAY HE WOULD HAVE TO NAME A DATE FOR HIS DEPARTURE IF HE WANTS TO AVOID A MASSIVE BLOOD LETTING THE THESE SENIOR PARTY FIGURES ARE SAYING THIS EVEN THAT MIGHT NOT PREVENT A FORMAL VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE AFTER JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD OR WHATEVER THE POLL RESULTS SOME BACKBENCHERS HAS MADE HER SO ENRAGED WITH DOWNING STREET THAT THEY SAY VOTE TO TRY TO GET RID OF THE P.M. IS NOW INEVITABLE
THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH THE STORY THAT WE ARE BECOMING AS A NATION LESS RELIGIOUS PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY HAVE NO RELIGION IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTNUMBER CHRISTIANS IN ENGLAND AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO A NEW ANALYSIS WHICH SHOWS THAT THE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES UP IN A RELIGION REFERRED TO AS NUNS
THAT IS N. O. N. E. S. O. CASE THERE WAS ANY DOUBT REACH FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT LAST YEAR THAT'S ALMOST DOUBLE THE FIGURE OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN CENSUS THOSE WHO DEFINED THEMSELVES AS CHRISTIAN ANGLICANS CATHOLICS AND OTHER DENOMINATIONS MADE UP A MERE FORTY THREE POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION
THE CHARITIES AID FOUNDATION HAS RELEASED ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON CHARITABLE GIVING HER WHICH CONCLUDES THAT IF THE U.K. IS STILL TO BE SEEN AS A NATION OF FUNDRAISERS AND CHARITY SHOP LOVERS OF THE GREAT TRADITION OF BEING AMONGST MOST GENEROUS COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IT IS A VISION THAT OWES MORE TO WOMEN THAN TO MEN THE STORIES IN THE NEWSPAPER TODAY IT SAYS THAT SIXTY PER CENT OF WOMEN GOT INVOLVED IN SOME FORM OF CHARITABLE ACTIVITY IN A TYPICAL MONTH LAST YEAR COMPARED
TWO FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF MEN AND NORTHERN IRELAND IS REVEALED AS THE MOST TRUSTING PART OF THE U.K. THAT WAS FROM A REPORT LAST WEEK IT'S ALSO REVEALED IN THIS REPORT IS THE MOST GENEROUS BECAUSE ALMOST NINE IN TEN PEOPLE IN NORTHERN IRELAND TOO SOME FORM OF CHARITABLE GIVING OR COMMUNITY ACTIVITY AND SIR PHILIP GREEN THE MAN WHO USED TO OWN B.H.S. IS BACK IN THE NEWS THIS MORNING IN A WAY THAT HE POSSIBLY MAY NOT LIKE THAT MUCH
FRONT PAGE OF THE BUSINESS SECTION OF THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH THE STORY THAT SAYS HIS RETAIL EMPIRE WAS WARNED OF FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE FATAL SALE OF B.H.S. THE DOMINANT FRONTMEN FOR IT BUY OUT LAST YEAR
HAD A HISTORY OF BANKRUPTCIES AND A LACK OF RETAIL EXPERIENCE THE ASTONISHING REVELATION AS THE TELEGRAPH PUT IT WAS MADE YESTERDAY IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF M.P.S BY GOLDMAN SACHS THE ONE ADVISOR TO ARCADIA GROUP THAT WAS NOT PAID FOR ITS SERVICES
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM HE'S ORGANISED DOG FIGHTING ON OUR STREETS THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS BILLY'S THAT TOUGHER ACTION IS REQUIRED TO COMBAT IT TOM SIMONS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE ARE THEY SAYING IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM TOM YES THOSE FIGURES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO COME BY BUT THEY CROSS REFERENCE THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WANT ONE PART IN PARTICULAR BEDFORDSHIRE WHERE THEY'VE BEEN DOING
UNDERCOVER WORK TO TRY AND LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AND ALSO FIGURES THAT THE R.S.P.C.A. GATHERS THE NUMBER OF CALLS TO ITS CONTROL CENTRE ABOUT ORGANISED DOG FIGHTING RUNNING BETWEEN SORT OF FOUR THREE FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR CALLS PROBABLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BUT THE CONCERN IS THAT THE SORT OF DOG FIGHTING THAT'S GOING ON IS NOT THE PERHAPS MORE ORGANISED MEET SWEAR DOGS FIGHTS IN A SPECIALLY BUILT PIT AND PEOPLE BET ON IT USUALLY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
BUT A NEW FORM REALLY WHICH IS FIGHTS TAKING PLACE ON STREET CORNERS KNOWS KNOWN AS ROLES WHERE OFTEN THE AIM IS TO UPHOLD THE HONOUR OF THOSE INVOLVED CERTAINLY THERE IS A LINK TO GANG ACTIVITY SO YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DOGS ON CHAINS FIGHTING IN THE STREETS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND A BIT THAT SHOULD MAKE IT MORE VISIBLE AND EASIER TO CRACK DOWN UPON SHOULD KNIT ARE THEY SUGGESTING THAT THAT ISN'T HAPPENING BECAUSE A NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR DOG FIGHTING HAS INCREASED
THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONS HAS INCREASED A BIT THE CONCERN IS I THINK THAT IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT IN A WAY TO SPOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOGS FIGHTING AND STILL FIGHTING AND THAT IS A REAL ISSUE SOME OF THESE THESE CONFRONTATIONS ARE
SOMEWHAT AD HOC SO THE DOGS ARE DEFINITELY BEING ENCOURAGED TO FIGHT WHERE THE LEGAL CRUEL SPORT SAYS IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS IS IN SOME WAY ORGANISED IS THAT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TRAINING OF THE DOGS GOING ON THEY BELIEVE THAT DOGS ARE BEING FOR EXAMPLE HELD UP ON ROPES AND ON TYRES HUNG FROM TREES TO TRY AND TRAIN THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR FITNESS SO HOME FROM THEIR JAWS AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT OTHER DOGS ARE BEING USED AS BAIT
TO TRY AND TRAIN THE DOGS TO IMPROVE THEIR FIGHTING SKILLS WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS VERY DAMAGING TO THE OTHER DOGS SO IT'S WHAT IN A WAY A MORE OPEN PROBLEM BUT ALSO A MORE HIDDEN PROBLEM SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DEAL WITH AND CERTAINLY THE POLICE ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS THE OTHER ANIMAL AGENCIES AND THERE IS A CERTAIN CONCERN THAT IT COULD SIMPLY BE MISUNDERSTOOD AS ORGANISED DOG FIGHTING WHEN IT IS JUST DOGS FIGHTING IN THE STREET
WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TOM SIMON THANK YOU THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX FRACKING HAS BEEN GIVEN THE GO AHEAD BY COUNCILLORS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE SO WHAT NEXT ROGER HAD A BH'ANN IS OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST I SPOKE WHAT NEXT IS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IS ALREADY SAYING THAT THEY WILL WILL CONTINUE THE FIGHT ROGER YES I MEAN THIS COULD BE A WATERSHED JOHN I MEAN IT IS A WATERSHED IN POLITICAL TERMS THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY FRACKING IN THE U.K.
THE TREASURY WOULD BE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF THERE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO REVENUES AS NORTH SEA OIL AND GAS DRY UP AND THEY'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SHALE GAS HELPING TO PAY FOR THE N.H.S. AND OTHER THINGS AND ALSO TO IMPROVE ENERGY SECURITY BUT THIS DECISION LAST NIGHT AS YOU SAY WAS A HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL
NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNCIL COUNTY COUNCIL HAD FOUR THOUSAND REPRESENTATIONS AGAINST AND THIRTY IN FAVOUR THEY'VE GONE WITH THE THIRTY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SURVEYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF DOES OF PREFERENCES IN ENERGY FROM THE PUBLIC IT SHOWS THAT CONSISTENTLY THE PUBLIC FAVOURS WIND AND SOLAR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS GOT RID OF AND DOESN'T LIKE SHALE GAS AND NUCLEAR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO GO WITH SO THERE IS THE FUEL THERE FOR CONTINUED RESISTANCE
I THINK PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DON'T PROPERLY UNDERSTAND FRACKING
I THINK FRACKING IS SOUNDS LIKE A DIRTY WORD DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A SWEAR WORD IN THIS SORT OF THING IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION SO ENVIRONMENTALIST SET OFF WHAT SOME WOULD CALL A SCARE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE U.S.A. WITH EXPLODING GAS PIPES AND WHAT HAVE YOU MORE SOBER ANALYSIS FROM THE AGENCIES SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY IT IS MORE SENSIBLE TO FRACK OUR OWN GAS IN THE U.K. BECAUSE THE ENERGY COST
OF GETTING OUT GAS FROM SOMEWHERE HALFWAY ROUND THE WORLD CAT OUR SAY AND THEN SHIPPING IT TO THE U.K. THE ENERGY COST AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE GREATER IN DOING THAT THAN FRACKING OUR OWN GAS BUT PEOPLE HAVE PEOPLE HAVE GOT AGAINST THIS TECHNOLOGY I THINK THE GOVERNMENT OVER HYPED IT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS PEOPLE DON'T TRUST IT AND ALSO YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS MASSIVE LOCAL RESISTANCE IF YOU LIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE DO YOU WANT GAS WALES ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR BACK DOOR OR NOT
CONSIDERING THAT THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF IN A REPORT HE'S HAS CONCEDED THAT IT WILL PROBABLY AFFECT YOUR HOUSE RESALE PRICE AND THE ANSWER IS YOU DON'T SO THERE MAY BE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE ONSHORE BLOCKED ALLOCATED IN THE U.K. POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF WALES BUT I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF RESISTANCE ROGER MANY THANKS
THE TIME IS QUARTER PAST SIX ROB YOUNG'S HERE WITH A BUSINESS NEWS INCLUDING MORE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FRACKING DECISION YES INDEED THE APPROVAL OF AN APPLICATION TO EXTRACT GAS BY FRACKING IN NORTH YORKSHIRE COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL TECHNIQUE TO BE EASED AT OTHER SITES IN ENGLAND AND IN A MOMENT WILL BRING YOU AN INSIGHT INTO LAST YEAR SALE OF NOW COLLAPSED V.H.S. ITS FORMER OWNER WAS WARNED ABOUT THE BUYERS HISTORY OF BANKRUPTCY BUT BACK TO THAT DECISION TO ALLOW THIRD ENERGY
TO EXTRACT SHALE GAS AT A SITE IN RYEDALE HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS TO VOICE THEIR ANGER AT THE PROJECT WHAT COUNCILLORS ON NORTH YORKSHIRE'S COUNTIES PLANNING COMMITTEE VOTED SEVEN TO FOUR IN FAVOUR WITH US IS PAUL EKINS A PROFESSOR OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING SO ARE THERE ANY MORE LEGAL OR REGULATORY HURDLES FOR THIRD ENERGY
WELL THERE ARE PLANNING CONDITIONS WHICH THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO UNDERTAKE AND COMPLY WITH SO IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON BUT THEY HOPE THAT THEY'LL HAVE COMPLIED WITH THOSE BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND THAT FRACKING OR START BY THE END OF THE YEAR TO FRACKING WE'LL START BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANY HAVE SAID THEY HOPE AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THEN DO YOU THINK FOR FRACKING APPLICATIONS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY DOES THIS MAKE IT MORE LIGHTLY
WELL I THINK AS ROGER HAD BEEN SAID EARLIER IT WAS A POLITICAL WATERSHED IN THE SENSE THAT PLANNING PERMISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY SINCE SINCE SINCE THE MORATORIUM AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WEATHER
IT'S RELEVANT ELSEWHERE IS NOT SO CERTAIN BECAUSE THIS IS AN APPLICATION THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING WELL LETTERS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THEREFORE THE ECONOMICS IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE MORE FAVOURABLE THAN DRILLING A NEW WELL GAS PRICES ARE CURRENTLY VERY LOW THEY FALLEN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE U.S. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT
AND IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR TO ME THAT AT THIS WELL OR ANYWHERE ELSE THE TECHNOLOGY WILL IN FACT BE ECONOMIC LIVER HOBBLE AT THESE PRICES RIGHT SO WHY WOULD COMPANIES WANT TO APPLY FOR PERMISSION TO CONDUCT TRACKING GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT PROFITABLE AT THE MOMENT
WELL THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESS PLANS THAT SUGGESTS THAT IT MIGHT BE PROFITABLE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE THEY MAY BE THINKING THAT GAS PRICES WILL GO UP AGAIN AND INDEED THEY MAY GO UP MODESTLY THOUGH I WOULD VERY MUCH DOUBT THEY'LL GET BACK ANYWHERE NEAR TO THEIR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HIGHS AND THEY ARE KEEN TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS IN FACT AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE RESOURCE THAT ON THE ON THE BROADER QUESTION DO WE NEED THE GAS FROM FRACKING
GLOBALLY WE CERTAINLY DO NOT THE WORLD IS AWASH WITH GAS AND THE U.K. ALREADY HAS SUBSTANTIAL IMPORT FACILITIES TO BE ABLE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO IMPORT THE GAS THAT WE NEED SO IN MY VIEW THE ENERGY SECURITY ARGUMENTS ALMOST ENTIRELY SPECIOUS BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ISSUES TO DO WITH JOBS TO DO WITH REVENUES TO DO WITH POTENTIAL TAXES LIKE ANY NEW INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IT CAN BRING INVESTMENT IT CAN RING JOBS
AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE GROUNDS ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS FOR IS FAVOURING THE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT ED ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO DO WITH WITH SMALL EARTHQUAKES OR GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION ARE PEOPLE RIGHT TO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS
WELL IN LINE WITH THE SMITHS REVIEW CONCLUSIONS OF SOME MONTHS AGO I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY SO THAT THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ARE ACCEPTABLE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOT A NOTABLE ADVOCATE OF REGULATION AND IN FACT IT HAS CUT BACK THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY STAFF AND CAPACITY BUT THERE ARE RULES IN PLACE AROUND TRACKING THERE ARE OF COURSE RULES IN PLACE AND PROVIDED THAT THOSE RULES ARE FOLLOWED THEN I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE SAFELY DEPARTED
BUT WERE WE TO HAVE A HUGE EXPANSION OF THE INDUSTRY THEN I THINK THE ABILITY THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AT ITS CURRENT SIZE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RULES WERE FOLLOWED AND TO ENFORCE THE RULES I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT O.K. THANK YOU PROFESSOR PAUL EKINS THEY'RE FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON NOW WE ARE LEARNING PIECE BY PIECE THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. PUTTING ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS AT RISK AND EVENING A FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUND BLACK HOLE IN ITS PENSION SCHEME
MORE THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THE SALE OF A HIGH STREET CHAIN LAST YEAR WERE QUESTIONED BY M.P.S FOR SEVERAL HOURS LATE YESTERDAY ANTHONY GOTTESMAN MONDAY CO HEAD OF U.K. INVESTMENT BANKING AT GOLDMAN SACHS TOLD M.P.S HE WARNED SIR PHILIP GREEN'S ARCADIA THAT DOMINIC TO PELT THE WOULD BE BUYER OF B.H.S. HAD A HISTORY OF BANKRUPTCY
WE INDICATED
REALLY HE POTENTIAL I DID NOT HAVE RETAIL EXPERIENCE
WE INDICATED THAT THE PROPOSAL ALWAYS HIGHLY PRELIMINARY AND LACKING IN DETAIL
WE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE BEAR BE BID EIGHTY HAVE A HISTORY OF BANKRUPTCY WE TOLD HIM TO BE THERE SO
WHAT THE LAWYERS COULDN'T FIND HER HE WAS A BANKRUPT WE WOULDN'T WERE IT FOR THAT
BY RIVER THROUGHOUT THAT TIME ADVICE
WELL ARCADIA'S FINANCE DIRECTOR PAUL BUDGE SIR DOMINIC TO PELL HAD A CREDIBLE PLAN AND HAD A GOOD TEAM AROUND HIM AND ARCADIA'S CHAIRMAN LORD RUBINA SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT B.H.S. WOULD'VE GONE INTO ADMINISTRATION IF IT HADN'T BEEN SOLD WHEN IT WAS HE ALSO SAID THE SALE WAS APPROVED AT A BOARD MEETING BUT HE WASN'T PRESIDENT AND HE BELIEVED HE HAD FULFILLED HIS DUTIES WITH US IS TREVOR DATSUN
FORMER EXECUTIVE OF TWO OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST RETAILER SAINSBURY'S AND TESCO NOW A PARTNER AT THE CONSULTANTS ARE TWELVE THE MONEY TREVOR GOOD MORNING ON THAT FINAL POINT THERE IS IT UNUSUAL FOR A CHAIRMAN TO BE ABSENT FROM A BOARD MEETING WHERE SUCH A DECISION IS TAKEN
I THINK IT IS I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE OF THE MORE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF YESTERDAY I MEAN WE WERE IT'S INTERESTING YOU WENT FROM NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO THE JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE AND THERE WAS QUITE A LOT OF BOTH BUT WHAT WE REALLY FOUND OUT IN THE WAY OF NEWS WAS THIS SORT OF ABSENCE OF THE CHAIRMAN'S THE FIRM HAND OF THE CHAIRMAN AT THE BOARD OF TAFFETA WHICH IS THE ARCADIA
PARENT COMPANY WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THIS ABSOLUTELY KEY EVALUATION OF THE SALE OF B.H.S.
DOES THIS TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT HOW ARCADIA'S COMPANIES OR RUN
IT COULD DO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT EARLY TO TO JUDGE THAT WE'VE GOT SOME MORE HEARINGS COMING ON THE EIGHTH AND THE FIFTEENTH WHICH WILL HEAR MORE FROM THE TRUSTEES AND WE'LL HEAR FROM PHILIP GREENE HIMSELF PHILIP GREEN IS A VERY STRONG MAN KNOWN FOR BEING SORT OF QUITE HANDS ON IN HIS BUSINESSES I WOULDN'T WANT TO DRAW TOO MANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THAT BUT I HAVE TO SAY I DID RAISE MY EYEBROWS QUITE QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY HEARING HEARING THAT
THE ENTIRE PROCESS HAD BEEN CEDED TO A SUB COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND THAT WHEN THE BOARD MET ITSELF THE CHAIRMAN WASN'T PRESENT THE CHAIRMAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN CONTROL
GREENE'S COMPANY KNEW THAT DOMINIC TO PELL HAD BEEN DECLARED BANKRUPT PREVIOUSLY SHOULD THAT A FACT FACT FACT HAD MORE GREATLY IN THEIR DECISION AND IS THERE A DUTY OF CARE EXPECTED ON BEHALF OF THE CELLAR
I THINK THERE CERTAINLY IS A DUTY OF CARE WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL WE WE MAKE LAWS WE CAN'T REALLY EXPECT COMPANIES TO TO KIND OF CREATE MORAL PRECEDENT ON THE HOOF IT LOOKS AT THE MOMENT AS IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLE TO EXPECT GREATER DUE DILIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE THE ARCADIA PEOPLE THERE WAS CERTAINLY SOME DUE DILIGENCE THAT WENT ON BUT SHE SEEMS TO HAVE COME FROM
YOU KNOW FROM LEFT FIELD NOBODY REALLY QUITE KNEW WHO HE WAS ACCEPTED DONE THAT A FEW TIMES WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE GREATEST QUALIFICATION FOR RUNNING A HUGE RETAIL BUSINESS O.K. THANK YOU TREVOR TREVOR THAT'S FROM HERE TWELVE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE STORIES WHICH ARE INTERESTING INVESTORS THIS MORNING ON MARKETS GUESSES DAVID STUBBS THE GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT MORNING DAVID MORNING ON B.H.S. THERE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY WELL I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS AS WE JUST WENT THROUGH OF
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT HAD ON A PUBLIC COMPANY LEVEL THAT WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE OF THE STOCKS AND INVEST IN IT INDEED WE LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT CORPORAL GOVERNORS OF THESE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR TO DRIVE LONG TERM SHAREHOLDER RETURN SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OPEN QUESTIONS LET'S TALK ABOUT GREECE THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS CALLED FOR UPFRONT UNCONDITIONAL DEBT RELIEF FOR GREECE ESSENTIALLY PART OF ITS DEBTS BEING WRITTEN OFF BECAUSE IT SAYS WITHOUT THAT
THE COUNTRY'S FINANCES WOULD DETERIORATE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE COMING YEARS DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN GIVEN THAT GERMANY AND OTHERS ARE NOT KEEN ON ESSENTIALLY LOSING MONEY INDEED AT LET I THINK ONE THING CERTAINLY WON'T HAPPEN AND THAT'S WRITING DOWN THE ACTUAL EURO AMOUNT OF DEBT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THERE IS KIND OF ANOTHER WAY OF BRINGING DOWN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE PAYMENTS I FIXING THE INTEREST RATE FROM ONE AND A HALF PER CENT OUT TO US TWO THOUSAND FORTY AND THE SAME TIME HAVING A MORE REALISTIC BUDGET SURPLUS TARGET
I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS TO GET DONE IN ORDER FOR GREECE TO HAVE BEEN A SUSTAINABLE SITUATION BUT I DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR A WHOLE SUMMER OF WRANGLING OVER THE ISSUE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THAT GERMANY AND FRANCE AND OTHERS AGREED TO WRITING OFF A PORTION OF THE DEATH IT WILL MAKE SERVICING THEIR DEBT MORE MANAGEABLE IT EXACTLY YOU PUT YOU EITHER EXTEND THE MATURITY A DEBT YOU WOULD REDUCE INTEREST RATES SOME COMBINATION OF THAT OF COURSE YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A LOT OF THAT THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED BUT AGAIN AT THE GIVEN THE DEBT SITUATION IS HAPPEN AGAIN
LET'S TALK ABOUT POTENTIALLY BIG DEAL COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE WORLD OF DRUGS AND CHEMICALS THE GERMAN COMPANY BAYER INTERESTED IN BUYING THE AMERICAN G.M. SEED PIONEER MONSANTO FOR FORTY THREE BILLION POUNDS BUT INVESTORS DON'T SEEM ALL THAT HAPPY WHY NOT FORTY THREE IS NOT A BERLIN IS THE ROUGH APPARENTLY LOOK THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF LARGE DEALS IN THAT KIND OF BIOTECH INDUSTRY I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF AN ONCOMING WAVE OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WE SEE IN IN EUROPE
PARTLY HELPED BY THE E.C. BEES COPA BOMBED BUYING PROGRAMME THESE DEALS HAPPEN WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT SHE WAS USUALLY BUY THAT BY THE PURCHASER THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NOW BETTER THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN NOT ARE NOT JUST FOR THE INTEREST RATE AND THAT DEBT BUT THIS YEAR THE VOLUME OF IT
EVEN THOUGH GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD IS CONTROVERSIAL BANNED IN PARTS OF
THE WORLD THIS IS STILL SEEN AS SOMETHING WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE TO YELLOW I THINK SANTA HE'S A HE'S A LEADER IN THIS FIELD OF COURSE HAS GOT HIS EXCEPT A LOT OF THERE'S A NEGATIVE PRESS ON AWESOME ON SUMMER HIS ACTIVITIES BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO THE DESIRE TO TIE UP THESE KIND OF THIS PIPELINE EARL OF DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WHAT'S UNDER HIS HE WAS A LEADER IN THAT INDUSTRY
O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE SPOTIFY IT SEEN ITS REVENUES FOR EACH ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS BUT HAS YET TO MAKE A SINGLE PENNY AND PROFIT ONE HEARS THIS WELL I THINK THAT YOU'RE SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF INTEREST IN IN THE STREAM IN TECHNOLOGY A LOT OF CUTTING TO MATTERS IN THE SPACE AND LIKE ANY EARLY STAGE TECH INDUSTRY IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY TURN A PROFIT UP EARLY ON
YOU NEED LEADERSHIP OF MARKET AND MARKETS SIZED TO DO THAT I THINK SOME SUBMERGES AGAIN IN THIS IN THIS INDUSTRY WILL EVENTUALLY TO SOME PROFITS RIGHT SO THERE WILL BE PROFITS IN MUSIC EXTREMELY AT SOME POINT I THINK SO I THINK SO AS OF COURSE BUT THIS IS THE ART OF THE ARTIST OBVIOUSLY WORRYING ABOUT THE HOW MUCH THEY GET PAID IT SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE BARRIERS TO ENTRY EXCEPT YOU EXCEPT I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S GOING GREAT INVESTMENT RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU DAVID DAVID STUBBS THERE FROM J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT

IS AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING HER SAID THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE IS PUT IN THE HEALTH OF SERVICE PERSONNEL AT RISK BY CONTINUING TO PRESCRIBE A MALARIA DRUG ANTI MALARIAL DRUG KNOWN AS LARRY AND WITHOUT FULLY RECOGNISING ITS RISKS PHILIPPA DOCKLANDS APARTMENT AT HILARY MEREDITH SOLICITORS SHE SAYS A GROWING NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAVE COME FORWARD CLAIMING TO HAVE SUFFERED SIDE EFFECTS AFTER TAKING LARRY
AH WE DO NOT TURN THAT I BELIEVE WE WERE NOT GOING TO RUN THAT CLIP AFTER ALL SO THERE WE ARE MY MISTAKE ANYWAY A REPORTER SCENE A CADETSHIP IS WITH ME AND
SHEENA YOU WERE ON THIS STORY A LONG TIME AGO SO IT HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT FOR QUITE A WHILE WELL JOHN IT'S BEEN CONTROVERSIAL FOR QUITE A WHILE LARRY HAS BEEN DEBATED BY MEDICAL GROUPS OFFICIAL ORGANISATIONS AND PEAS FOR A WHILE NOW IT'S A ONCE A WEEK ANTI MALARIAL TABLET JUST GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND GIVEN TO SOLDIERS SERVING OVERSEAS
AND THERE'S BEEN CALLS FOR IT TO BE BANNED BECAUSE OF ITS ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS NEUROLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING DEPRESSION VIVID NIGHTMARES ANXIETY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS NOW LAST YEAR YOU MAY RECALL THAT ON THIS PROGRAMME WE REPORTED THAT A SENIOR MILITARY MEDIC HAD COOLED ON MINISTERS TO STOP USING THE DRUG UNTIL THEY WERE COMPLETELY SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE
THAT TRIGGERED THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THIS COMBINED WITH CRITICISM AND OTHER MEDICAL OPINION AND THE INQUIRY NOW HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY GIVING TROOPS THIS DRUG WITHOUT CARRYING OUT PROPER HEALTH CHECKS BEFOREHAND WHAT DO THEY SAY
WELL THEY'RE SAYING THAT BASICALLY WHEN LARRY AND IS GIVEN TO SOMEBODY HEALTH CHECKS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT IS FAITH FACE TO FACE MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS AND THEY SAY THAT HE'S NOT BEEN THE CASE THAT IN SOME CASES TROOPS HAVE BEEN GIVEN IT AS PART OF THEIR PACKS WHEN THEY GO ABROAD THEY NOT SPOKEN TO ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS A HUGE FAILING ON THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HE'S PART AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS HOW SERIOUS
PUT IT THIS WAY JOHN I'VE SPOKEN TO ABOUT TWELVE PEOPLE WHO'VE TAKEN LARRY UM OVER THE LAST YEAR AND ABOUT THREE OF THEM HAVE CONTEMPLATED TAKING THEIR LIFE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRETTY SERIOUS
THE DOCTORS THEMSELVES COS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKING LOTS OF PEOPLE LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME THE DOCTORS THEMSELVES SO MUCH WE'VE HAD A BIT OF A MIXED RESPONSE SOME MEDICS AND DOCTORS ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A VERY EFFECTIVE DRUG AND THAT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ALTERNATIVES
SUCH AS MAN AROUND AND DOXY CYCLING BUT WE DO KNOW FROM LOOKING AT THE REPORT IN DETAIL SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GIVEN EVIDENCE TO DISPUTE THAT AND SAY THAT ACTUALLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE
THAT THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE JUST AS EFFECTIVE THE GOVERNMENT HAS WELCOME THIS REPORT AND SAYS THAT MOST PERSONNEL ARE TAKING OTHER MEDICATION NOW BUT WHEN LARRY UM HE'S PRESCRIBED IT SAYS THAT IT IS AFTER A RISK ASSESSMENT THANKS VERY MUCH WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS TEN PAST EIGHT
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN ERITREA IS MARKING THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS INDEPENDENCE THAT WAS A MOMENT OF TRIUMPH AFTER ITS LONG STRUGGLE WITH ETHIOPIA TODAY THE COUNTRY IS KNOWN FOR ITS GOVERNMENT'S ABSOLUTE GRIP ON POWER AND FOR THE NUMBER OF ITS CITIZENS WHO CHOOSE TO ATTEMPT THE DANGEROUS CROSSING TO EUROPE MARY HARPER THE B. B. SEES AFRICA EDITORS IN ERITREA FOR THE ANNIVERSARY AND JOINS US NOW FROM THE CAPITAL ASMARA AND IT IS QUITE A CONTRAST MARY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND TODAY
HOW HOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGE IF INDEED IT DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUMBER OF ITS CITIZENS WHO DECIDE THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE COUNTRY FOR THEM AND DECIDE TO MIGRATE
WELL BE ETHIOPIAN PEOPLE BEAT BECAME LANGUAGE BUT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT HIT THEM DO YOU THINK THEY SAY THEY'D BE MAINLY BECAUSE OF LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THEY ARE IS A MENU HERE GOT YOUR PAPER PEOPLE LEAVE A GOOD PEOPLE HERE BUT I LIKE YOU REALLY HAD ME YOU'D BE VERY GRUMPY RIGHT WHERE WE WANT TO BE A GREAT ERITREA A VERY NO
MARY HARPER IN ASMARA THANK YOU TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE IN FIGHTING OVER EUROPE MAKES THE FRONT PAGES OF THE MAIL AND THE SUN WHICH CLAIMS THE CHANCELLOR HAS TRIGGERED A FURIOUS TORY BACKLASH OVER WHAT IT CAUSES DOOMSDAY DOSSIER ON THE IMPACT OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. THE SENSORS TO UNNAMED MINISTERS HAVE THREATENED TO QUIT OVER WHAT A SCENE AS SCARE TACTICS BY THE REMAIN SIDE THE MAIL'S HEADLINE KNIVES OUT FOR CAMERON
PAPER RECKONS DOZENS OF TORY M.P.S ARE THREATENING TO TOP OF THE PRIME MINISTER OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE REFERENDUM WITH SENIOR PARTY FIGURES WARNING HE MUST NAME A DATE FOR HIS DEPARTURE IF YOU WANT TO AVOID A MASSIVE BLOODLETTING SOME BACKBENCHERS ARE SAID TO BE SO ENRAGED THEY BELIEVE A FORMAL NO CONFIDENCE VOTE TO TRY TO GET RID OF HIM IS NOW INEVITABLE AFTER NEXT MONTH REFERENDUM FOR ALL THE CRITICISM OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH BELIEVES IT'S WARNINGS ARE HITTING HOME AND STEERING VOTERS AWAY FROM BREAKS EXIT
THE PAPER PUBLISHES DETAILS OF A POLL WHICH IT SAYS POINTS TO A COLLAPSE IN SUPPORT FOR A VOTE TO LEAVE AMONG THREE CRUCIAL GROUPS THE OVER SIXTY FIVES MEN AND CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS THE TELEGRAPH NOTES AT ALL THREE GROUPS FAVOURITE A BRITISH EXIT WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE SAME SURVEY IN MARCH THE DAILY EXPRESS THOUGH HAS A POLE SUGGESTING BRITAIN'S MOTHERS ARE PLANNING TO VOTE IN HUGE NUMBERS TO QUIT THE E.U. BECAUSE OF WORRIES ABOUT PRESSURES ON SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS FROM WHAT IT CALLS UNBRIDLED IMMIGRATION
THE TIMES AND THE NEWSPAPER LEAD ON THE DECISION BY COUNCILLORS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE TO APPROVE THE FIRST FRACKING SCHEME IN BRITAIN FOR FIVE YEARS FRACKING BACK ON TRACK SAYS THE EYE THE TIMES AS THE LANDMARK RULING HAS GIVEN A BOOST TO SCORES OF PROJECTS ACROSS ENGLAND TO EXTRACT SHALE GAS
INDUSTRY INSIDERS EXPECT FRACKING IN NORTH YORKSHIRE TO BEGIN THIS WINTER WHEN COOL WEATHER IS LIKELY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACTIVISTS WHO ARE WILLING TO STAGE OUTDOOR PROTESTS FINALLY A PICTURE OF THE QUEEN SMILING BROADLY AS SHE ARRIVED AT THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW YESTERDAY'S FEATURED ON THE FRONT OF THE EXPRESS WHILE THE TELEGRAPH DESCRIBES HOW SHE DISPLAYED A DARK SENSE OF HUMOUR DURING HER ANNUAL VISIT
TO THE EVENT HER MAJESTY DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF LILY OF THE VALLEY WITH A HERB GARDEN AND WHEN SHE WAS TOLD THE PLANT WAS ONCE USED AS A POISON SHE REPLIED I'VE BEEN GIVEN TWO BUNCHES THIS WEEK PERHAPS THEY WANT ME DEAD
THIS IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE CHANCELLOR WARNED YESTERDAY THAT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD TIP THE U.K. INTO A YEAR'S A LONG RECESSION BUT IN THE COMMONS LEAVE SUPPORTERS ARGUED THE FORECAST WAS BIASED AND RESPONSIBLE HE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
AS THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN HEATS UP THE GOVERNMENT IS CLEAR IN ITS VIEW THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY HAPPY OUTCOME FROM HER VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN MODELLED TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
A SHOCK AND A SEVERE SHOCK THE MINISTER DAVID GOT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TREASURY FORECAST OF THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF LEAVING THE E.U. IN THE SHOCK SCENARIO A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD RESULT IN A YEAR LONG RECESSION A SPIKE INFLATION AND A RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT
AND AFTER TWO YEARS OUR ECONOMY WOULD BE AROUND THREE POINT SIX SMALLER THREE POINT SIX PERCENT SMALLER THAN IF WE REMAIN A MEMBER THE SEVERE SHOCK SCENARIO WAS OF COURSE EVEN NASTIER BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SCARED WE ALL KNOW THAT THESE FORECASTS ARE JUST RUBBISH BEING PRODUCED BY A GOVERNMENT THAT IS OBSESSED WITH PRODUCING PROPAGANDA THE SINEW CONSERVATIVE BERNARD JENKIN LIKE OTHER LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS HAD BEEN ANGERED BY WHAT HE FEELS IT'S A BIASED TREASURY DOCUMENT
HE SAID MINISTERS WERE DISHONESTLY TALKING DOWN THE U.K. ECONOMY THE SHOCK SCENARIO SUGGESTED NOTHING MORE SERIOUS THAN THE ECONOMY STAYING THE SAME SIZE AS IT WAS LAST YEAR DOES NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S ENTIRE CAMPAIGN JUST REINFORCED THE UNFORTUNATE IMPRESSION
TODAY'S POLITICAL LEADERS WILL SAY ANYTHING THEY THINK WILL HELP THEM GET WHAT THEY WANT WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR NOT AND DOES SHE NOT REALISE THAT MY RIFLE FRAMES THE CHANCELLOR AND THE PRIME MINISTER I CONTRIBUTED
CYNICISM ABOUT POLITICS AND A SENSE THAT VOTERS SHOULD NOT TRUST THEIR WARNER'S THE MINISTER DAVID GOT REPLIED THAT IT WASN'T JUST THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS HIGHLIGHTING THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE E.U. THE U.K.'S ALLIES RESPECTED BUSINESS PEOPLE AND ECONOMIST DID THE SAME NOW IT PAINED LABOUR SPOKESMAN ROB MARAS TO ADMIT IT BUT WELL UNUSUALLY PERHAPS I FIND MYSELF AGREEING WITH A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT THE MINISTER SAID TO THE HOUSE TODAY
TAKE TRADE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE IN VERY SHORT ORDER TRADE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD INCLUDING OVER FIFTY OTHER COUNTRIES' ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY THERE WOULD BE HUGE UNCERTAINTY AS THE HONOURABLE MEMBER WILL KNOW AND I KNOW FROM HAVING BEEN IN BUSINESS MYSELF ONE OF THE KEY
OF BUSINESS ALWAYS IS UNCERTAIN BUT ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER AND FORMER CABINET MINISTER LIAM FOX THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GNOME RATCHETING UP THE GLOOM FACTOR I'M VERY SORRY THAT MY ROD ON ALL HAS HAD TO COME TO THE HOUSE TO DEFEND THIS DISREPUTABLE SHABBY AND MISLEADING REPORT
IN THE LAST TREASURY REPORT THERE WERE THREE SCENARIOS SET OUT
INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.A. WHY WAS THAT LEFT OUT OF THIS REPORT
THE S.N.P. ARE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S TACTICS GIVE THEM A TWINGE IN THE OLD WAR WOUNDS FROM THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM THIS WAS ROGER MULLEN HERE WE GO AGAIN
THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS DETERMINED TO RECYCLE PROJECT FEAR BASED ON TREASURY PROJECTIONS INVENTED AND THE BACK OF ITS MOST FAMOUS NEOCLASSICAL FACT PACK
IF THE ONLY THING THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO OFFER HIS FEAR THERE DO THE CAUSE OF THE NEW NOR FAVOURS THERE ARE MANY POSITIVE REASONS FOR STAYING IN IT
WELL LABOUR'S DENNIS SKINNER IS NO GREAT FAN OF THE E.U. OR HAVE THE CHANCELLOR FOR THAT MATTER THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THIS TREASURY ANNOUNCEMENT IS TRYING TO CONVEY IS EVERY TIN IN THE GARDEN IS LOVELY BUT IT ALL BE THROWN AWAY IF YOU DO
TRUTH IS IT'S SPACE ON A PONY
THEY SPEAK OF LITTLE ELSE AND PARLIAMENT JUST NOW SO THE E.U. DOMINATED THE DEBATE IN THE LORDS THE FORMER LIB DEM LEADER LORD ASHDOWN DIDN'T THINK OUR DESCENDANTS WOULD THANK US FOR VOTING OUT THE TRUTH OF IT IS THAT LEAVING WILL DIMINISH OUR INFLUENCE WILL WRECK OUR ECONOMY AND WILL DAMAGE OUR SECURITY LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE AN ACT MY LORDS
OF HISTORIC FOLLY FOR WHICH OUR CHILDREN AND I GRANDCHILDREN WE PAY THEM
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONSERVATIVE AND AUTHOR LORD DOBBS WAS NOT IMPRESSED BY THEIR LONG LIST OF FELLOW CREATIVE TYPES WHO WANTED THE U.K. TO STAY IN EUROPE EVEN THE SUPERSTARS OF MY OWN CREATIVE INDUSTRIES
JOINING OUR CULTURE WILL CRUMBLE YOU KNOW MY LORDS ON A CLEAR DAY
FROM THE RED CARPET IT'S ALMOST POSSIBLE TO SEE AS FAR AS THE WAITING LIMOUSINE AND BORROWING FROM A FELLOW WRITER HE WARNED EVERYONE OF THE PERILS OF GROUP THINK
SUSAN DO REPORTED THERE YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST STUFFED UP PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND DIGITAL RADIO THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE CONSIDERING LEGAL ACTION TO CHALLENGE THE APPROVAL OF FRACKING IN NORTH YORKSHIRE
IT IS FORTY YEARS SINCE RICHARD DAWKINS' FIRST PUT FORWARD HIS IDEA THAT THE GENE THAT RATHER THAN THE SPECIES OR THE INDIVIDUAL IS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND EVOLUTION WILL BE TALKING TO PROFESSOR DAWKINS ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE THE POWER OF HIS ARGUMENT HE DESIGNED
A SERIES OF SIMPLE COMPUTER PROGRAMMES OR BIO MORPHS THAT ALLOW THE USER TO WITNESS EVOLUTION IN ACTION AS IT WERE WRITTEN IN WHAT IS NOW AN OBSOLETE COMPUTER CODED ASSUMED THAT THE BUYER MORSE HAVE BEEN LOST FOREVER BUT THANKS TO HIS PUBLISHER PENGUIN DAWKINS VIA MORSE HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM EXTINCTION A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FIELDING HAVE BEEN FINDING OUT A BIT MORE
SO WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN IS A BIOMORPHIC IN THE CENTRE WHICH LOOKS LIKE A TREE SURROUNDED BY PERHAPS SOME NUMBER OF CHILDREN THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST PROFESSOR RICHARD DAWKINS INTRODUCES ME TO HIS BUYER HOW OFF A SERIES OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMES HE WROTE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO TO ILLUSTRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF EVOLUTION THEY LOOK ALMOST THE SAME AS THE PARENT IN THE MIDDLE
JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE EACH ONE IS A MUTANT VERSION OR JEAN HERE'S CHANGE THERE IT'S ON AND YOU CHOOSE WHICH CHARLIE WANT TO BREED FROM WITH THE MOUSE AND IT GLIDES TO THE CENTRE OF THE SCREEN
GIVES RISE TO A NUMBER OF PROJECT WHICH AGAIN HAD MUTATED SO AFTER SAY TWENTY GENERATIONS YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU'VE GRADUALLY MOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL ANCESTOR TO SOMETHING LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT
DAWKINS WROTE THE ORIGINAL CODE IN THINK PASCHAL FOR THE APPLE MACINTOSH PLUS BOTH LONG SINCE OBSOLETE AND HAD ASSUMED THE PROGRAMMES WERE LOST
WORKING WITH OR IT YOUR CODE RICHARD DAWKINS WROTE BUT AFTER A PAINSTAKING EFFORT OF RETRIEVAL AND WRITING FIRST BY U.S. PROGRAMMER HOLLAND CALLUM AND MORE RECENTLY BY MATCHING TREE EIGHT FOR DAWKINS PUBLISHER PENGUIN
THE PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN RESURRECTED CODE ITSELF DOESN'T QUITE WORK
OVEREATING COMPUTERS BUT MOST OF THE IS STILL QUITE TRUE TO RICHARD SO HIS AGA IF MISSUS FORMULAS ARE STILL IN THEIR WISH TO IT'S A FEW THINGS TODAY MATCHES UP WITH THE MORE MODERN TECHNOLOGIES BUT ALL IN ALL HE'S STILL HE'S STILL THERE WHAT I DIDN'T
IS THAT AT THE END OF TWENTY GENERATIONS IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE AN INSECT
IT'S REMARKABLE THAT THIS ASTONISHINGLY SIMPLE PROCESS IS THE EXPLANATION FOR THE WHOLE PANOPLY OF LIFE THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMPLEXITY THE BEAUTY AND THE ILLUSION OF DESIGN
YOU CAN FIND A LINK TO THE BUYER MORPHS ON A WEBSITE THAT TWENTY TWENTY TO EIGHT THERE WILL BE MORE FROM MISTER DAWKINS ON THE SELFISH GENE RELIGION AND MORTALITY HIS OWN MORTAL
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN DO WE NEED A SPECIFIC LAW AGAINST DOG FIGHTING RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT TO CURB HER BRUTAL PRACTICE THAT INVOLVES DOGS BEING BRED AND SOLD SPECIFICALLY FOR FIGHTING HERE'S WHAT ONE WOMAN WHO REHABILITATES DOGS USED IN THAT WAY TOLD THE B. B. C. ABOUT THE INJURIES TO A STAFFORDSHIRE TERRIER WHO HAD BEEN TREATED AS BAIT IN THE TRAINING OF OTHER DOGS
ALL OF THE WOUNDS ARE CONSISTENT WITH FIGHTING SO ANOTHER DOG GRABBING HER BITE THROAT AND THEREFORE SHE SHE HAS A SORT OF A LOT OF LACERATIONS AROUND THE NECK AREA
HEAD SLAMMING IS USED QUITE A BIT WHERE THE DOG WILL BE PICKED UP BY ITS BACK FEET AND SWUNG AGAINST THE WALL SO THAT BLUNT TRAUMA TO THE EYE COULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING HEAD SLAMMING WHICH IS PART OF THE TRAINING
ASSOCIATED WITH FIGHTING THE BROKEN TEETH AGAIN PLIERS ARE USED TO SNAP OFF THE CANINES TO MINIMISE DAMAGE DONE TO THE OTHER DOGS
WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY EDUARDO GONE SELF AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS WHICH IS CARRIED OUT AN UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION INTO DOG FIGHTING IN THE DESCRIPTION WE JUST HEARD THAT THE INJURIES TO THAT TO ONE PARTICULAR DOG VERY UNPLEASANT TO HEAR IS THAT THE SORT OF THING YOU FOUND IN YOUR INVESTIGATION UNFORTUNATELY HER TEARS I MEAN THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A DIFFICULT INVESTIGATION TO DO BOTH BECAUSE OF THEIR VERY CLAN TO SUN NATURE OF THE CRIMES
BUT ALSO THE VERY DISTRESSING NATURE OF THE INJURIES THAT WE SAW BEING SUFFERED BOTH BY THE DOG'S INVOLVED IN DOG FIGHTING OF THOSE WHO ARE YOU BEING USED LIKE THAT DOG WE WERE JUST HEARING ABOUT US AS BAIT ANIMALS AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FERAL CATS COLONIES BEING KEPT BY DOG FIGHTERS NOT TO SUPPLY A DOG FIGHTERS WITH ANIMALS TO BE TESTED UPON IF YOU LIKE SET OF FIGHT THEM TO GET THEIR AGGRESSION LEVELS UP THAT PARTICULAR DOG THAT WE WERE JUST HEARING ABOUT I REMEMBER WE WERE IN FACT FILMING HER A FEW DAYS AGO
SHE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED OF THAT CAMERA TRIPOD BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE INSTRUMENTS THAT WERE USED TO TORTURE HER SO SHE WAS ELECTROCUTED THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BURNS SHE HAS BEEN WHAT'S CALLED HEAD SLAM SO THAT'S A PROCEDURE WHERE THEY LITERALLY A RAMMING AT THE DOG'S HEAD INTO A WALL TO BREAK BONES MAKE IT TOUGHER MAKE IT MORE AGGRESSIVE YOU DID YOU SAY CLANDESTINE AND YET REPORT THAT YOU'VE RELEASED AS SAYS THAT
ORGANISE FIGHTS ARE NOW TAKING PLACE OUT OF DOORS MORE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE AND ABSOLUTELY THERE'S BEEN AN EVOLUTION IN THE TYPE OF DOG FIGHTING THAT WAS SEEING SO THERE'S STILL SOME OF THE ISOLATED REMOTE RURAL BARN TYPE FOR DOG FIGHTS WE'VE GOT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL SYNDICATES THERE'S BETTING MONEY INVOLVED THERE'S ANIMALS BEING SMUGGLED IN FROM THE MIDDLE EAST
THROUGH SERBIA WITH FALSE PASSPORTS AND THEN THERE'S THIS MORE URBAN STYLE OF DOG FIGHTING WHICH IS THE TYPE THAT WE FOUND IS STEADILY ON THE INCREASE IT'S IN CAR PARKS IT'S IN PARKS ABANDON PUBS AND WE FIND THAT THAT IS HAPPENING IN TOWNS AND CITIES ACROSS THE U.K. VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE DAY AND ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IT'S NOT BEING DEALT WITH OR NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEALT WITH BY BY THE AUTHORITIES IN THE NUMBERS OF CONVICTIONS FOR DOG FIGHTING IS INCREASING
HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CONVICTIONS FOR ANIMAL FIGHTING IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SIX SPECIFIC ANIMAL FIGHTING CONVICTIONS THIRTY ONE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT COVERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF EFFECTS ARE FOR EXAMPLE WITH OFFENCES UNDER THE DOT DANGEROUS DOGS ACT AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY ARE SPECIFIC DOG FIGHTING BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY SPECIFIC RECORDING
OF OFFENCES AND THAT THEREFORE MEANS THAT THE POLICE DON'T HAVE THE CUE TO GO OUT AND INVESTIGATE AND BRING ABOUT PROSECUTION BUT DESPITE NOT HAVING YOU STILL BELIEVED THAT A REVIEW OF THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT IS NECESSARY I THINK THAT THERE'S TWO SEPARATE THINGS HERE ON THE ONE HAND THE LEGISLATION WE HAVE ISN'T FIT FOR PURPOSE THE SENTENCES ARE VERY LENIENT SO THE MAXIMUM APPLICABLE CUSTODIAL SENTENCE HERE ARE SIX MONTHS COMPARED WITH FIVE YEARS
IN MANY OTHER PLACES PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE U.K. AT A DOG FIGHT ALSO BANS ON KEEPING ANIMALS IF YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF ANIMAL ABUSE UNENFORCEABLE BECAUSE THERE'S NO NATIONAL REGISTER WE NEED TO HAVE TOUGHER SENTENCES WE NEED A NATIONAL REGISTER EDUARDO GONE SALVERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AUSTRIA HAS A SKATE BY A WHISKER HAVING AS ITS PRESIDENT A MAN DESCRIBED AS A POPULIST LEADER OF THE FAR RIGHT HE'S NORBERT WHOLE FERN HE LOST BY THE NARROWEST OF MARGINS TO THE LEADER
OF THE GREEN MOVEMENT WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE FAR RIGHT IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ONE HUNDRED BY TWO OF OUR CORRESPONDENTS LUCY WILLIAMSON WHO WAS IN PARIS AND JENNY HILL A BULLING CORRESPOND WHO'S IN VIENNA AT THE MOMENT THE STAYING WITH US JUST FOR A MOMENT JENNY THERE IS GREAT CONCERN ON THE PART OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE NARROWNESS OF THIS VICTORY ARE THEY GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND VERY MAY STILL BE ABLE TO COMMAND A RECOUNT VERY ANNE
WISHED OF TO WE HAD TO WAIT TWENTY FOUR HOURS UNTIL EVERY
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE I THINK JUDITH ELECTION HAD REALLY EXPOSED DIVISION
PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN GERMANY I WAS WATCHING THIS ONE
ONE GERMAN NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING PATRICK FIVE RELIEF IN
A LOT OF CONCERN HERE OF COURSE BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS CHARACTERISED BY THINK BY DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE POLITICAL MAINSTREAM WHY NAME
FINAL BECAUSE
BUT BUT BUT IN GERMANY OBVIOUSLY YOU DO HAVE MAINSTREAM POLITICAL PARTIES WHO HAVEN'T BEEN REJECTED YET BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT AN EMERGING WHEN I SAY EMERGING IT HAS EMERGED ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY PARTY WHICH IS PRETTY RIGHT
MORNING ONE PAID FOR THEM I THINK I MEAN THAT'S A WAKE UP CALL TO ALL DEMOCRAT AND A POSTER THIS MORNING IN GERMANY ACTUALLY FED BUT HERE THEY ARE AND IF THE DEUTSCHLAND COULD GAIN THREE PREVENTED
COMING SO CLOSE TO VICTORY IN AUSTRIA BARRY
I THINK IT WAS POINTING OUT THAT THERE ARE OF COURSE
WILL IT DO YOU SO WELL HERE AND YOU'D BE HAD MUCH YOUNGER OF COURSE AT THE PARTY WE CAN PARTY
NORBERT HOPPY YESTERDAY TIPPET IT HEY MAN THAT NOW TRY FROM VIENNA WHAT HE WAS WAITING MOWING YOUR LAWN INTACT WHILE HE WAS WAITING TO HEAR WHAT WERE THE RESULT
WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AND I THINK THAT WAS RIGHT RUN LUCY IN IN PARIS YOU'VE GOT THE NATIONAL FRONT ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL AT THE MOMENT
YES I THINK WHAT JENNY WAS SAYING THERE ABOUT THIS ELECTION GOING DOWN IN HISTORY WHATEVER THE RESULT IS VERY MUCH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT IT AND YOU MIGHT SAY WHAT THEY WOULD SAY THAT WOULDN'T THEY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL AND THE RESPONSE WAS YOU KNOW WE'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY THEY THEY PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING LOOK IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IS RETURNED THIS IS INEVITABLE PROCESS BUT HISTORICALLY IMMINENT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE F.N. HAS DONE ELECTIONS HERE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS YOU CAN SEE THAT
THEY'RE SORT OF DETOXIFICATION CAMPAIGN TO SOME DEGREE HAS WORKED THEIR SHARE OF THE VOTE HAS GONE UP ONE IN THREE FRENCH NOW SAY THEY SHARE F.N. IDEAS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY WINNING NATIONAL ELECTIONS THEY DON'T DO AS WELL AND HERE THEY ARE HANDICAPPED BY TWO THINGS AGAIN TO DIFFERENCES WITH THE FREEDOM PARTY
ONE IS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN NATIONAL POWER AND BEFORE SO THEY HAVEN'T PROVED THEMSELVES AND THE SECOND MORE IMPORTANT OBSTACLE IS THAT THE THEY DON'T TEND TO GET THROUGH THE SECOND ROUND REGIONAL ELECTIONS HERE IN DECEMBER THEY DID VERY WELL IN THE FIRST ROUND IN THE SECOND ROUND PEOPLE TEND TO EAT THE TUBE MAIN REPUBLICAN PARTY'S CLUB TOGETHER PEOPLE COME OUT TO VOTE AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE THAT TINGE OF SOMETHING NOT QUITE NOT QUITE RIGHT LOT THEY'RE EQUAL STILL
SORRY NO I JUST SAID VERY QUICK THOUGHT IS IT IMMIGRATION THAT'S DRIVING ALL THIS I THINK IT'S HARD IT'S THE ECONOMY BUT I THINK THAT FEEDS INTO A LOT OF THE RHETORIC ON IMMIGRATION FRANCE HAS NOT BEEN A BIG A BIG RECEIVER OF MIGRANTS IN THE WAY THAT GERMANY HAS FOR EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THE RHETORIC IS PLAYING INTO WHAT IS A STAGNANT ECONOMY AND THE FAILURE OF THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES TO REALLY ADDRESS WORKING PEOPLE'S CONCERNS JENNIE AND LUCY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND FOR THE PAPER IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST
IT'S A VERY GOOD MORNING TO LET'S START THE FORECAST FOR TODAY WITH ALL OF EASTERN ENGLAND PRETTY CHILLY START AND HAS SOME FOG TO BE HAD TO IN THE VALE OF YORK AND ALSO ANYWHERE FROM A SORT OF NORTH AND WEST NORFOLK IN PATCHES DOWN TOWARDS THE STANSTED AREA THAT WILL BE AWAY I HOPE WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO BUT IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND IF YOU'RE ON THE ROADS FIRST UP
OTHERWISE IT'S A DRY ENOUGH AND A FINE ENOUGH DAY THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AROUND DEVELOPING CLOUD THIS AFTERNOON MAY TEMPER THAT SUNSHINE AND THE NORTH EASTERLY BREEZE FROM A COOL NORTH SEA WILL TEMPER THE FEEL OF THE DAY ON THE EAST COAST AS WELL ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEGREES RIGHT ON THE COAST INLAND MID TO UPPER TEENS SOMEWHERE IN THE LONDON AREA AROUND TWENTY DEGREES FOR THE WESTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND ALL OF WALES A DRY FINE FAIRLY CHILLY START AGAIN LOOK AT THE MIST AROUND BUT NOT THE FOG PROBLEMS OF FURTHER TOWARDS THE EAST

MINISTERS ARE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT THEIR FAVOURITE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY A LOCAL COUNCIL AFTER A WAIT OF NEARLY FIVE YEARS THEY SAY FRACKING IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TAX REVENUES FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE BLOCKS OF LAND ACROSS THE U.K. ALLOCATED FOR ONSHORE DRILLING BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF A SHALE GAS BOOM
FIRMS WILL NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY CAN PRISE THE GAS OUT OF BRITAIN STUBBORN ROCKS FOR AN ECONOMIC PRICE AND THEY'LL FACE CONTINUED RESISTANCE FROM THE PUBLIC WHO SURVEYS SUGGEST FAVOUR WIND AND SOLAR POWER NOT NUCLEAR AND SHALE GAS
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ARE PONDERING YOUR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE DECISION IN RYEDALE OTHER CAMPAIGNERS WHO SAID THEY'LL FIGHT ON BECAUSE THE PROJECT CREATES TOO MUCH DISTURBANCE AND BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T SHOWN HOW SHALE GAS CAN FIT WITH ITS POLICY ON CLIMATE CHANGE

THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAS BEEN ACCUSED BY A GROUP OF M.P.S ARE FAILING TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES WHEN PRESCRIBING THEM CONTROVERSIAL ANTI MALARIAL DRUGS TO SERVICE PERSONNEL METHOD QUINN ALSO NAMED BY ITS BRAND NAME LARRY HAS BEEN LINKED TO DEPRESSION PANIC ATTACKS AND HALLUCINATIONS THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE SAID IT WAS DEEPLY DISTURBING THAT SOME IN THE ARMED FORCES APPARENTLY THREW AWAY THE DRUG
A LAW FIRM REPRESENTING SEVERAL ARMED FORCES VETERANS TO LARIM HAD RUINED LIVES AND IT WOULD CONTINUE TO PURSUE LEGAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE M.O.D. SI MC ATTACHED HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY
TODAY'S REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DESIGNATE AS A DRUG OF LAST RESORT AND THAT IT SHOULD ONLY BE PRESCRIBED TO THOSE PERSONNEL WHO ARE UNABLE TO TAKE ANY OF THE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS DOXY CYCLONE AW MALA OWN
THE COMMITTEE ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF FAILING IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY NOT FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE DRUGS MANUFACTURERS BROCH WHICH SAY THAT FACE TO FACE MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BEFORE ANYBODY IS GIVEN THE MEDICATION
THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BECOME COMPULSORY BROCHURES AGREED WITH THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS WHILE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS MOST PERSONNEL ARE TAKING OTHER MEDICATION BUT WHEN LARRY AND IS PRESCRIBED IT'S AFTER A RISK ASSESSMENT

NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAS SAID THAT THE CURRENT BLANKET BAN SHOULD BE REASSESSED PROFESSOR THANK YOU RAM KRISHAN SAYS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS SAFE AND HAS MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS

OR A TRAY AS WELL KNOWN AS A COUNTRY PEOPLE RAN AWAY FROM THAT THOUSANDS FROM THE DIASPORA HAVE COME HOME TO JOIN THE PARTY
THE OFFICIAL SLOGAN FOR THIS YEAR CELEBRATION IS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF RESILIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT ERITREANS HAVE NEEDED TO BE SELF RELIANT THEY'VE BEEN INTERNATIONALLY ISOLATED FOR YEARS BUT THERE ARE SMALL SIGNS OF CHANGE THERE'S MORE INVESTMENT FROM OUTSIDE MAINLY AND MIMING AND THE COUNTRY'S MAKING MORE FRIENDS ESPECIALLY IN THE ARAB WORLD
MARY HARPER REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS THAT THE GREEK AUTHORITIES HAVE BEGUN TO EVACUATE MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES FROM A CAMP HAD IT ALL MANY NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER VERY BIG CAMP THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME HAD BEEN GROWING OVER THE PAST MONTHS OUR CORRESPONDENT YOUR LIONS NELL IS THERE I THINK BEING HELD AT A ROAD BLOCK JUST OUTSIDE THE CAMP IS THAT RIGHT YOUR LAND
HEY THAT'S RIGHT JOURNALISTS OF BEING KEPT WELL BACK ONLY GREEK NATIONAL TELEVISION IS ALLOWED IN BUT WE'RE GETTING UPDATES FROM ACTIVISTS AND FROM N.G.O.S WORKING WITH PEOPLE INSIDE THE CAMP ALREADY WE HAVE SEEN FOUR BUSES THAT HAVE LEFT WITH PEOPLE FROM
OH I'M AFRAID THAT THAT LINE HAS LET US DOWN WE WILL TRY TO RETURN TO HER SOMETIME DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE AND MOVED TO ANOTHER STORY MEN AND WOMEN IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE BEING GIVEN AN ANTI MALARIAL DRUG THAT HE'S PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AT RISK THAT'S WHAT A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S CONCLUDED THE M.P. JULIAN LEWIS CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE THE DEFENCE COMMITTEE AND HE IS ON THE LINE NO AT LEAST I HOPE HE HAS GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD
TELL US ABOUT THIS DRUG AND WHAT IT DOES WELL THIS IS AN UNUSUAL CASE BECAUSE THERE WAS LITTLE DISPUTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS ANTI MALARIA DRUG CAN HAVE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS SO LARRY UNTOLD LARRY MESSALA QUEEN I BELIEVE IS THERE THE CHEMICAL NAME FOR IT SO WHAT THE MANUFACTURERS QUITE RIGHTLY RECOMMEND IS THAT IT SHOULD BE
PRESCRIBED ONLY UNDER VERY PRECISE CONDITIONS AND THEY INCLUDE HAVING A FACE TO FACE RISK ASSESSMENT INTERVIEW AND THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS
UNLIKELY TO BE PRACTICAL IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEND A LARGE NUMBER OF TROOPS INTO THE ZONE WHERE MALARIA MIGHT BE RIFE AT SHORT NOTICE AND YET THE DRUG APPARENTLY HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED WITHOUT THAT FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW THAT SO MANUFACTURERS SAY IS ESSENTIAL AND THE EFFECT OF THAT HAS BEEN WHAT
WELL IN A SMALL MINORITY OF CASES IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THERE'S A CASE OF A VERY DISTINGUISHED MAJOR GENERAL WHO'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE SINCE THEN IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT'S WRECKED HIS LIFE IN A MUCH LARGER MINORITY OF CASES THERE A SORT OF DISTURBED NIGHTS DAMAGED SLEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL IDEAS
THAT ARE UNSETTLING AND DANGEROUS AND IN REALITY THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DEEPLY UNPLEASANT SO MUCH SO THAT PHRASES LIKE MAD MONDAY ALL CRAZY TUESDAY ARE USED AMONGST THE ARMED FORCES WHEN THIS STUFF HAS BEEN DOLED OUT IN THE PAST I DO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE USED BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS EXPRESSION A DRUG OF LAST RESORT ARE QUITE SURE THAT WELL WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ALTERNATIVE FOR EXAMPLE IF THE M.O. DE COULD SHOW THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO DEPLOY INTO A REGION WHERE THERE WAS RESISTANCE BY MALARIA TO ALL OTHER DRUGS BUT THIS ONE
AND EVEN THEN WE WOULD SAY ERE THE FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS MUST BE DONE AND IT MUST BE MADE CLEAR TO PEOPLE WHAT THE RISKS ARE ON THEY MUST BE GIVEN THE CHOICE OF WHETHER THEY WANT TO TAKE IT OR NOT SO IN REALITY IN PRACTICAL TERMS WE'RE SAYING IT SHOULDN'T BE USED
AT ALL AND AND WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING TO THE M.O. DOOLEY OR WHO SOMETIMES RELIED ON THIS ARGUMENT THAT THIS DRUG AND CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY WHEN OTHER DRUGS MIGHT NOT BE EFFECTIVE TO TELL US WHICH REGIONS OF THE WORLD THAT APPLIES TO BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT IT SHOULD EVER BE USED AT ALL MIKE THE QUESTION I WAS GOING YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY
YOU'RE SAYING WE DON'T WANT DESTRUCT OUT ABSOLUTELY I'M SORRY THERE SHOULD BE ANY DOUBT ON THE MATTER AT ALL THAT'S WHAT A DRUG OF LAST RESORT MEANS HURT BUT ONLY IN THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD IT SHOULD IT BE CONTEMPLATED FOR USE AND EVEN THEN THE FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS MUST BE DONE AND THAT'S WHAT APPARENTLY HE'S NOT BEEN HAPPENINGS BEEN VERY DISTURBING THAT THE M.O.D.
ARE UNABLE TO TELL US WHETHER THEY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN GIVING THE INTERVIEWS OR NOT EVEN OVER THE THE LAST THREE YEARS WHEN RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN WITH THE THE SURGEON GENERAL
WE FIND THAT REALLY RATHER INCREDIBLE AND WE KNOW THAT THE MINISTER AT THE START OF HIS EVIDENCE QUITE RIGHTLY APOLOGISED TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IF AS HE PUT IT THEY'D BEEN GIVEN THE DRUG WITHOUT THE FACE TO FACE ASSESSMENTS WHICH ITS OWN MANUFACTURERS LAY DOWN MUST BE GIVEN IF THE DRUG IS TO BE DOLED OUT SAFELY WE SHALL BE TALKING TO THE SURGEON GENERAL HIMSELF AT TEN PAST EIGHT SO I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT THAT TO HIM DURING LEWIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
AND AT FORTY MINUTES PASS AND WE CAN NOW GO BACK TO YOUR LAND NAIL AT YOUR MANY CAMP NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER YOU WERE TELLING US THAT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY ALLOWED INTO THE CAMP YOUR LAND WHAT'S NOT CLEAR TO US HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THOSE REFUGEES AS YOU SAY THE AUTHORITIES HAVE MOVED IN AND THEY ARE MOVING THEM OUT OF THE CAMP BUT WHERE ARE THEY PUTTING THEM
BASICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVED TO NEWLY COMPLETED ORGANISED CAMPS SO THAT THEY'RE SILENT DRAINS CAN BE PROCESSED ALREADY WE HAVE SEEN FOUR BUSES LEFT FROM THE SITE
HUNDREDS OF RIOT POLICE HAVE MOVED IN ON BUSES AS WELL BUT GREEK OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT RUNNING TO USE THEY'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY EVACUATE AT THE MANY CAMP THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING THERE OVER THERE
BUT THE NUMBERS OF EVEN TALKED IN THE PAST WEEK I WAS THERE A FEW DAYS AGO WE SAW SOME PEOPLE LEAVING ON THAT
OTHERS TAKING BUSES TO MOVE TO OTHER CENTRES BECAUSE THEIR CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET SERVICES TO PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE THE CAMP THEY'VE BECOME INCREASINGLY DESPERATE THEY'RE REALLY THEY'VE STAYED IN THAT SIZE JUST BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE CLOSE TO THE BORDER THEY LIVE
AND CONTINUOUS HOPES AT THE BORDER CROSSING THE BEEN PLEASED WITH MACEDONIA CONTINUOUSLY SINCE MARCH AND FACTORY OPEN BUT THERE IS NO SIGN OF THAT THE MACEDONIANS ARE ABSOLUTELY RESOLUTE
THAT'S RISING ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN TOTAL HAVE BECOME STUCK IN GREECE OF COURSE NOT THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY WANTED TO END UP WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AT ALL JUST THEIR FIRST STOP ON THE WAY OUT FROM THE TURKEY FROM TURKEY FROM THE TURKISH COAST THERE'S NEARLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT UNEMPLOYMENT HERE GREECE'S FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING BUT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEIR ASYLUM CLAIMS SHOULD BE PROCESSED HERE MOST OF THEM COME
SERIOUS SOME MOROCCAN AFGHANISTAN AS WELL A LOT OF CHILDREN AT A MANY CAMP WHEN I WAS THERE A FEW DAYS AGO THIS IS PLACE WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN A SING A LOT OF FAMILIES SOMETIMES WOMEN WITH CHILDREN ALONE WHO ARE HOPING TO JOIN HUSBANDS WHO'VE ALREADY MADE IT TO GERMANY WITH IN THE PAST
THE IDEA SHOULD BE THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR ASYLUM CLAIMS IN GREECE AND THEN THE GREASE CAN PERHAPS REDISTRIBUTE PEOPLE TO GO THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR CRANES APPROVED TO MOVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITHIN THE E.U.
YOUR LAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE MEGA MURDER OF TWO AGRICULTURAL GIANTS IS PROVING CONTROVERSIAL ROB HAS MORE ON THAT FOR US ROCK YES SHAREHOLDERS IN THE GERMAN CHEMICAL JOINED BY ARE UNHAPPY AT THE COMPANY'S ATTEMPT TO BUY THE U.S. SEEDS BUSINESS MONSANTO FOR WAIT FOR IT FORTY THREE BILLION POUNDS DESPITE THAT EYE WATERING THE BIG NUMBER SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED
BY MIGHT HAVE TO PAY EVEN MORE IF IT WANTS TO CREATE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FARM SUPPLIES COMPANY WITH US HE SCOTT MILLER FROM CASS BUSINESS SCHOOL HE LECTURES ON COMPANY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW OFTEN TO THESE HUGE MERGERS WORK OUT WELL FOR THE COMPANIES INVOLVED ONCE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY SO IT'S NO BETTER THAN A CROSS AND A TOSS OF A COIN AND THAT'S IMPROVED OVER THE PAST MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WHERE HE USED TO BE QUITE A BIT WORSE THAN THAT BUT
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE SOMETHING WHICH YOU CAN TAKE THE BANK WE'VE BEEN HEARING THE NEWS THIS MORNING GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS ARE CONTROVERSIAL BOTH COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE G.M. BUSINESS IS THAT WHAT THIS MERGER IS ABOUT WELL CERTAINLY YOU CAN I'LL BE BUYING WITHOUT ME THINKING ABOUT G.M. FOODS IT IS INTERESTING OF COURSE YOU'RE EARLY YOUR STORY ABOUT THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING BUT
THERE IS A GERMAN COMPANY G.M. FOODS ARE VERY POLITICAL HOT POTATO IN IN GERMANY THE G.M. FOOD ISSUE IS GOING TO BE ONE THERE IS
GONNA CONTINUE TO BE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM I'M LOOKING AT THIS DEAL AND SO DO YOU THINK THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN ODD TIE UP THAT WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S A TIE OF WHICH MAKE SENSE FROM A BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE BUT THERE'S OTHER ISSUES AS WELL WHICH ARE COMING AROUND NOT THE LEAST THAT WE HAD BEEN BEEN THE G.M. FOOD ISSUE BUT THERE ARE A MAJOR INVESTOR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS DEAL AS WELL
INVESTORS FROM ONE SIDE THINK THEY'RE PAYING I THINK BUYERS PAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE MONSANTO SO I DON'T THINK THEY'RE PAID NOT ENOUGH WELL IT'S A THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT PREMIUM OVER WITH THE SHARE PRICE WAS FOUR MAN SANTO BEFORE THE DEAL WAS ACTUALLY THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO NOT ANNOUNCE FIXES ME WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY SENT OVER TWO MONTHS AGO THE
THAT'S A VERY HEFTY PREMIUM MONTH CENTRES SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN DROPPING PRETTY MUCH WITHIN THE PAST YEAR THIS STILL DOESN'T EQUAL THE SHARE PRICE OF WHERE THEY WERE A YEAR AGO AND SECONDLY THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT ARE PRETTY BIG PREMIUM TO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND FIND OUT THAT YOUR SHARES ARE WORTH MORE BUT THERE IS THERE IS THERE CERTAINLY
PROBABLY HAD ROOM IN THERE AND COMES WITH THOSE SHAREHOLDERS ARE EXPECTING IF THIS MERGER DOES GO AHEAD IT WOULD CREATE WHAT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FARM SUPPLIES BUSINESS WILL REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD BE SCRUTINISING THIS VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE SOME FARMERS MAY WILL BE CONCERNED AND THAT IS THE OTHER BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS THE REGULATORY ISSUES I MISS THE COMPETITION BACK IN THE U.S. KNOWN AS THE F.T. TRUST ISSUES ON THIS ONE
THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT GLOBALLY AND NOT JUST BY THE EUROPEAN REGULATOR IS NOT JUST BY THE U.S. REGULATORS BUT BY REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO PASS A LOT OF TESTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO AHEAD AT THE CRATE PRICES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE THIS ONE GOING AHEAD O.K. THANK YOU IT'S GOT ANOTHER FROM CATH'S BUSINESS SCHOOL
THANK YOU ROBERT IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY HOAX CALLS YESTERDAY SOME OF THE SCHOOLS HAD TO BE EVACUATED AFTER CALLS THAT REPORTED BOMBS BEING PLACED ON THE PREMISES IN SOME CASES EXAMINATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE AT THE TIME WE'RE JOINED NOW BY PHIL CAN'T HAVE US THE HEAD TEACHER OF CANTERBURY ACADEMY IN KENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE SCHOOL'S AFFECTED GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT HAPPENED WHAT DID THE CALLS
AND WE DEEMED TO BE AN ADULT IT'S DONE IT LIKE AN ADULT AS OPPOSED TO A CHILD AND HOW DID YOU RESPOND TO HOW QUEER HOW QUICKLY DID YOU DID YOU TAKE CIRCUS WELL WE COME AND SEEN YOU STOP IMMEDIATELY WE RUN A QUICK
JUDGED AS THE VOICE SOUNDED AND HAD TO BE AN ADULT BUT THE TOWN WAS CARMEN DELIBERATE WE DECIDED TO CONTACT THE POLICE AND ON WITH THE LEASE AGREEMENT DECIDED TO EXECUTE EVACUATION PROCEDURE OH ALL OF ALL THE CHILDREN ON THE PREMISES INCLUDING THOSE WHO NEEDS WELL DIDN'T WE
COME ON IN SKEWERED HALF OBSCURED LEAVE THE EXAM HALL ACTIVE SO REGRETTABLY WE HAD TO EVACUATE THE MAIN SCHOOL ON TO THE SCHOOL FIELD
BUT THE BUT YOU HAD THE VIEW THAT YOU SEARCH THE SCHOOL AND YOU HAD THE ALL CLEAR HE KNEW THE POLICE ARRIVE
WAS IT AN EXTERNAL ALEXANDER'S TAKE OFFERS THE TIME WASN'T JUST ONE EXAM IT WAS A BRIGHT DO YOU PICK SOME SOMETHING STOPPED ORT OF THE PROBLEM WAS UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY WAS G.C.S.E. ENGLISH YES WAS IT A G.C.S.E. EXAM
LITTLE WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SENIOR STUDENTS SITTING WHICH WHICH ADDS A WHOLE NOTHER LAYER RHYTHMS OF UNITY A SECT OF ALL OF THIS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE CHILDREN THEY'LL HAVE TO RESIT THE EXAM IN ITS ENTIRETY THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE UNDER RE EXAMINATION REGULATIONS AREN'T THE DIFFICULTY WAS THAT WE HAD TO CONTACT EACH OF THE EGGS ON BOARDS TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION TO THE VAN TO GET THEIR PERMISSION TO TERMINATE THE EGGS
GRADE AWARDED YES NOT THE SORT OF POSITION YOU WANT TO BE IN AT ALL A LIST LISTENING TO THIS IS LAURA CRUDDAS HIS POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS WHICH HAS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS THE U.K. HOW UNUSUAL IS IT FOR THIS MANY SCHOOLS TO BE AFFECTED TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX WE THINK BYE BYE CALLS ON THE SAME DAY
GOOD MORNING I THINK AT THIS IS A FAIRLY UNUSUAL SITUATION AND THE FACT THAT IT AFFECTED SCHOOLS FROM KENT TO NEWCASTLE AND INDEED IN WALES
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE OF ME OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE MALICIOUS AND AND YOU CAN MAKE THESE SORTS OF HOAX CALLS THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY EASY TO DO OUR POSITION IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY ENCOURAGE REPORTING OF EXAM HOKE AT HOAXERS BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT IT LEADS TO TWO PHILIPPA HEXES SO AT THE PUBLICITY REALLY GIVES PEOPLE WHO MAKE THREATS THE THE ATTENTION THEY SEEK
YES I CAN SEE THERE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I MEAN THIS THIS THIS IS NOW IN THE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IS THERE ADVICE THAT YOU WOULD GIVE TO HEAD TEACHERS I MEAN OTHER THAN THE OBVIOUS WAY THAT THEY RESPOND TO CALL THE POLICE AND LET THE POLICE DEAL WITH IT
I THINK THE WAY THAT PHIL ARTICULATED THE RESPONSE OF CANTERBURY ACADEMY WAS WAS REALLY I'M A MODEL CASE OF OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS SO YOU NEED YOU RECESS THE THREAT
YOU AND TALK TO THE POLICE YOU DECIDE WHETHER AN EVACUATION IS NECESSARY IN PHIL'S CASE YOU ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN EXAM CONDITIONS I THINK HE DID ABSOLUTELY ALL THE RIGHT THINGS
BUT ONCE ONCE YOU'VE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THAT IT IS AN ADULT MAKING THE CALL THEN PRESUMABLY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TREAT IT MORE SERIOUSLY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND HE DID IT HE DID HE DIDN'T ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING IN AND OBVIOUSLY HIS FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO TICK TO KEEP THE CHILDREN IN HIS CARE SAFE BUREAUCRATS OF THE ASSOCIATION SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEADERS AND FEEL KIND OF US OF CANTERBURY ACADEMY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN IT'S HOPPER SEVEN TIME FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM YOUR SLEET OPPONENTS OF FRACKING A WARNING THAT A PLANNING DECISION MADE IN NORTH YORKSHIRE LAST NIGHT COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR THOUSANDS OF WELLS TO OPEN IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. COUNTY COUNCILLORS APPROVE THE PLAN BY THE COMPANY THIRD ENERGY TO EXTRACT SHALE GAS USING HYDRAULIC FRACTURING AT A SITE IN RYEDALE
THE GREEK AUTHORITIES HAVE BEGUN AN OPERATION TO MOVE THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES FROM A CAMP AT IT ARE MANY NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER HUNDREDS OF POLICE MOVED IN AT DAWN AND STARTED TAKING PEOPLE TO BUSES THAT WILL TRANSFER THEM TO OFFICIAL CAMPS WITH BETTER FACILITIES THE GREEK GOVERNMENT SAYS THE OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS POLICE SAY THEY DON'T INTEND TO USE FORCE
A GROUP OF M.P.S SAYS THE ANTI MALARIAL DRUG LARRY UM USED BY THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED ONLY AS A DRUG OF LAST RESORT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE JULIAN LEWIS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME IN A SMALL MINORITY OF CASES THERE HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS
HE SAID IT WAS VERY DISTURBING THE M.O.D. HAD BEEN UNABLE TO SAY IF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES HAD HAD THE REQUIRED FACE TO FACE RISK ASSESSMENT BEFORE BEING GIVEN THE DRUG
A MINISTER IN BRAZIL'S NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED ASIDE AFTER HE WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE ALLEGEDLY CONSPIRING TO OBSTRUCT A MAJOR CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION COME OUT AS YOUR CAR APPEARS TO SAY THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE SUSPENDED PRESIDENT JEEVAN MERU SAPPH WOULD STOP INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PETROL BRAT SCANDAL HE SAYS HIS COMMENTS WERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT
THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CALLED FOR THE URGENT PROVISION OF SAVE CORRIDORS TO ALLOW CIVILIANS TO LEAVE THE BESIEGED IRAQI CITY OF FALLUJAH THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND MILITIA HAVE STARTED A MILITARY OFFENSIVE TO RE TAKE THE LEAD WHICH HAS BEEN IN I ASK CONTROL FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IS CALLED FOR A REASSESSMENT OF THE BAN ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS BY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PROFESSOR BINKY RAMA KRISHNAN SO THE SCIENCE OF G.M. HAD BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC OUR RESEARCH INDICATES IT'S SAFE AND HAS MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS
TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW FRACKING HAS TRANSFORMED THE ENERGY PICTURE IN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IS ABOUT TO DO THE SAME FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT INEVITABLY IS THE QUESTION THAT'S BEING ASKED BY SUPPORTERS AFTER A FRACKING COMPANY WAS GIVEN THE GO AHEAD YESTERDAY TO START WORK IN NORTH YORKSHIRE AND MY RELENTLESS OF COURSE ARE APPALLED AT THE PROSPECT WHEN I'M JOINED BY ONE OF THEM A CRAIG ABILITY WAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AND ALSO
BY ONE OF THE OTHER SIDE CAN CRONIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF U.K. ONSHORE OIL AND GAS AND MISTER CRONIN HOW IMPORTANT WAS YESTERDAY'S DECISION IN TERMS OF WHAT LIES AHEAD GOOD MORNING I THINK YESTERDAY'S DECISION WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP I THINK PEOPLE DO FORGET THAT WE HAVE BEEN
PRODUCING OIL AND GAS ON SHORE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY MANY DECADES NOT FRACKING WE HAVE HYDRAULICALLY FRACTURED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED WELLS IN THIS COUNTRY THE DIFFERENCE FOR SHALE IS THAT WE USE HIGH VOLUMES EXACTLY AND THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IT'S NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE THE TECHNIQUE IS WELL KNOWN ON SHORE IN THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO NORTH SEA DO YOU ACCEPT THAT MISTER BENNETT
I THINK YESTERDAY'S DECISION BY NORTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL WAS DISGRACEFUL BEFORE YOU GET ON TO THAT DO YOU ACCEPT WHAT TERM MY GROWN IN JUST SAID THAT WE'D BEEN FRACKING FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES AND WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO DO WHAT THEY ARE WHAT IS AND THERE'S BEEN NO FRACKING IN THE U.K. FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE LAST ONE NEAR BLACKPOOL OF COURSE CAUSED EARTHQUAKES OF WHAT IS WHEN YOU SAY EARTHQUAKES CAN WE BE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
YEAH VERY VERY VERY VERY TINY WAS LIKE A BUS PASSING NEARBY THAT STILL WASN'T SOMETHING AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WERE PARTICULARLY KEEN ABOUT YES THERE'S BEEN AN OIL AND GAS IN INFRASTRUCTURE ON SHORE IN FOR MANY YEARS JOHN BUT I MEAN THE FACT IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE SHOULD NOT BE BUILDING BRAND NEW OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE WE SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO LOOK AT NEW TECHNIQUES TO EXTRACT YET MORE ON AND GAS OUT THE GROUND REMEMBER THIS IS LESS THAN SIX MONTHS SINCE DAVID CAMERON WENT TO PARIS
FOR THE PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT WE SHOULD BE MOVING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AWAY FROM ON AND GUESS NOT INVESTING IN A WHOLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE TO LOCK NEW GENERATIONS INTO THIS TECHNOLOGY INTO YET MORE GAS WE SEEM TO BEHAVE HERE I MEAN THE ARTIC IS MELTING FASTER THAN SCIENTIST EVER PREDICTED JUST LAST WEEK INDIA SUFFERED RECORD TEMPERATURES OF FIFTY ONE DEGREES THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DYING IN HEAT WAVES
WHERE IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE'RE PRETENDING THIS ISN'T HAPPENING AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE TO BUILD BRAND NEW GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN CRITTER WHILE WE WHILE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE GLORIOUS DAY WHEN WE WON'T NEED ANY OIL AND GAS AND ELECTRICITY AND ALL THE REST OF IT FROM CARBON SOURCES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER WE ARE
IMPORTING HUGE AMOUNTS FROM PLACES LIKE QATAR AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COST OF DOING THAT IS FAR GREATER PRESUMABLY THAN DIGGING IT OUT OF OUR OWN GROUND WELL LET'S BE CLEAR THE VERY BEST YOU CAN SAY ABOUT SHALE GAS IN THE U.K. IS IT'S A BIT AKIN TO MOVING FROM HIGH TAR CIGARETTES TO MEDIUM TA
WHEN YOUR DOCTOR SAYING YOU NEED TO GIVE UP ENTIRELY BUT ACTUALLY IN NEW RESEARCH FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY PUBLISHED IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR SUGGESTS THAT THIS THE SHALE GAS BOOM IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH POLITICIANS HERE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT AS IF IT WAS A GOOD THING AS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN A THIRTY PER CENT INCREASE IN METHANE EMISSIONS FROM THE U.S. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO NOW METHANE IS A MUCH MORE POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS THAN CARBON DIOXIDE
AND SO THAT'S REALLY RAISING QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT WHETHER SHALE GAS HAS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF CLIMATE IMPACT RIGHT AND MISTER BENNETT MISTER CRONIN I BEG YOUR PARDON THAT IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT FACTORS ISN'T IT WE ARE ADDING TO THE PROBLEMS THAT THE PLANET ALREADY MANIFESTLY HAS
I THINK THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT I AGREE WITH MISTER BENNETT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO MOVE AWAY FROM COAL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE'VE SEEN THE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL WE NEED TO WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM COAL FIRST OF ALL IN ORDER TO TO GET TO A RENEWABLE FUTURE WE NEED WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE U.S. IS A MASSIVE REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS COMING FROM THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT FROM COLD TO GET A MASSIVE INCREASE
WE'VE SEEN A WEEK NO I DON'T I THINK THAT'S ONE STUDY I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OFFERS STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A REDUCTION IN METHANE A ACROSS THE U.S. INDUSTRY WE'VE ALSO SEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT FROM COLD TO GAS IN THIS COUNTRY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND THAT'S PARTLY DOWN TO THE NORTH SEA PARTLY DOWN TO THE ONSHORE AND ALSO PARTLY DOWN TO RENEWABLES
IN WHICH CASE MY BENNETT YOU'RE FINDING AT THE WRONG TARGET NOT AT ALL I MEAN THIS KIND OF SUGGESTION THAT YOU CAN MOVE IN A VERY LEISURELY WAY FROM COLD TO GAS AND THEN FROM GAS TO RENEWABLES AND TAKE SEVERAL DECADES OF IT THIS IS ABSURD THIS IS CLOUD CUCKOO LAND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US YOU KNOW AND LET'S BE CLEAR JOHN WE ARE SEEING THE TRANSITION AND WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SOME WAY
TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF BRITAIN'S ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY CAME FROM RENEWABLES LAST YEAR FIFTY DENMARK THINKS HE'S GOING TO GET FIFTY PER CENT OF ITS ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE WHOLE YEAR COMING FROM RENEWABLES IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS GERMANY JUST A WEEK OR SO AGO ACTUALLY WAS PRODUCING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF US ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLES SO IT ACTUALLY HAD TO TRY AND EXPORT SOME OF THAT ELECTRICITY
PORTUGAL IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAS BEEN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BUT WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR THAT PICTURE YOU KNOW THAT WELL I THINK WE COULD BE IF THE POLITICIANS TO STOP FAFFING WITH THE HUGE DISTRACTION IS SHALE GAS AND PUT FOOT TO THE FLOOR AND RENEWABLES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT WHAT YOU SEE IS ALL THIS FLIP FLOPPING FROM DAVID CAMERON ONE MINUTE HE'S
SAYING GREENEST GOVERNMENT EVER LET'S PUT A WIND TURBINE ON HIS HOUSE WHEN HE'S AN OPPOSITION IT SUITS HIM NEXT MINUTE HE'S SAYING LET'S HAVE A SHALE GAS BOOM YOU KEPT THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE YOU CANNOT INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE OF GAS INDUSTRY ONSHORE BUT THE GOOD THING IS JOHN IS LOCAL COMMUNITIES WON'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN THIS IS A DEEPLY UNPOPULAR TECHNOLOGY AND IT'S NOT GOING TO ADD MY MY GROWN IN THE END THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM ISN'T IT YOUR INDUSTRY'S PROBLEM LOCAL PEOPLE DON'T WANT GAS WELLS NEXT DOOR TO THEM
I THINK THE SITUATION IS THAT IN THE U.K. IN ONSHORE ENERGY WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FOR ITS WIND WASTES AWAY THAT SHE OR SHALE THAT GETTING THROUGH THE PLANNING SYSTEM INVOLVES A NUMBER OF LOCAL OBJECTORS AND THAT'S REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS
WHAT WE DO HAVE TO DO IT WAS AN INDUSTRY AS WE DID IN YORKSHIRE IS GO THROUGH THE FACTS TALK TO THE EXPERTS TALK TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABOUT THEREFORE YOU WOULDN'T WANT ONE NEXT DOOR TO YOU WOULD YOU I HAVEN'T NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER OF HAVING A WIND TURBINE OR I SHALL GUESS SITE NEXT TO ME
WHAT A BIT REALLY LITERALLY WAS JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM YOUR VALUE WAS GOING TO DROP LIKE A STONE YOU WOULDN'T MIND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT HOUSE PRICES GO DOWN IN FACT ACTUALLY THE THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN WIND FARMS WORK BEEN BUILT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO NOT WE WERE ON TOUR THAT WAS THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST FEARS IT WILL AFFECT OUR HOUSE PRICES WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OPERATING IN THIS COUNTRY WITH NO IMPACT ON ALL RIGHT DOING IT THERE I'M AFRAID THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH KEN CRONIN AND CRAIG BENNETT
THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS TORIES IN REVOLT AS HOW THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SUMS UP REACTION IN THE PARTY TO A SUGGESTION BY DAVID CAMERON THAT VOTING TO LEAVE THE E.U. IS IMMORAL IT SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER IS FACING A BACKLASH FROM MEMBERS OF HIS OWN GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THREATS OF RESIGNATIONS AFTER A TREASURY REPORT WARNED THAT BRECK'S IT WILL BE THE SELF DESTRUCT OPTION FOR BRITAIN
THE SUN SPEAKS OF THE CONSERVATORS BEING AT BREAKING POINT WHILE THE DAILY EXPRESS LIKENS THE TREASURY DOCUMENT TO TONY BLAIR'S DOSSIER ON SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FANTASTICAL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION MINISTER SIMPLY CANNOT GET AWAY WITH USING THE CIVIL SERVICE TO PUMP OUT PROPAGANDA TO SUIT THEIR POLITICAL NEEDS THE PAPER SAYS THE MALE IS EQUALLY CRITICAL IT SAYS TO CHILLING FORECAST OF ECONOMIC OBLIVION MAKES ONE WONDER HOW WE EVER MANAGED TO FLOURISH AS AN INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGN NATION FOR A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE BRUSSELS CAME ALONG TO TELL US WHAT TO DO
BUT THE TELEGRAPH THINKS THE REMAIN CAMPS WARNINGS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE POLES THE POLITICAL STRATEGIST SIR LYNTON CROSBY HAS WRITTEN A PIECE FOR THE PAPER IT SAYS SUPPORT FOR BELIEVED SIDE IS DWINDLING BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO QUELL CONCERNS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ARE BECKS IT THE GUARDIAN COLUMNIST POLLY TOYNBEE CONDEMNS WHAT SHE SEES AS THE XENOPHOBIC LIES OF BRECHT'S ITS SUPPORTERS SHE ARGUES THAT SEEMS TO BE NO DEPTHS TO WHICH THE OUTER CAMPAIGN WILL NOT SINK
ONCE AT THOSE SIMPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT NAME SEX AND AGE NOW SAYS THE TIMES THE NEXT U.K. WIDE CENSUS IS LIKELY TO ASK PEOPLE WHETHER THEY ARE GAY STRAIGHT OR BISEXUAL AND IF THEY ARE MALE FEMALE TRANS GENDER OR PERHAPS HAVE NO GENDER AT ALL THE PAPER SAYS NEW QUESTIONS ON SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY HAD TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL SURVEY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNDER PLANS TO HELP THE AUTHORITIES PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THOSE WITH NON BINARY IDENTITIES MANCHESTER UNITED'S DECISION TO SACK
MANAGER LOUIS VAN CARL WITHIN DAYS OF WINNING THE F.A. CUP PROVOKES RIC DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT THE GUARDIAN SAYS IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A MORE BRUTAL ILLUSTRATION OF HOW MUCH BRITAIN'S MOST POPULAR SPORT HAS CHANGED IN THE PAST OF FOOTBALL CLUBS PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO WIN GAMES AND TROPHIES THE GUARDIAN SAYS NOW IT IS TO MAKE MONEY
BY QUALIFYING FOR THE LUCRATIVE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE WHICH MY FAILED TO DO THE MIRROR THINKS IT'S HARD TO FEEL TOO SORRY FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS BITTERNESS OF BEING GIVEN THE BOOT IS SWEETENED BY IT SAYS A SIX MILLION POUNDS PAY OFF
AND THE NEW TATE MODERN EXTENSION WHICH OPENS IN LONDON NEXT MONTH RECEIVES ENTHUSIASTIC REVIEWS IN THE GUARDIAN AND THE TELEGRAPH WHICH SAYS IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE LEFT AUSTERITY BRITAIN BEHIND SHAPED LIKE A TRUNCATED PYRAMID THE PAPER SAYS IT'S A CONSIDERABLE BUILDING BY ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST ARCHITECTS AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME THE GODIN DESCRIBES HOW VISITORS A LEAD ON A TWISTING JOURNEY UP TEN TAPERING FLOORS FROM THE UNDERWORLD OF THE POWER STATIONS FORM OIL TANKS TO PANORAMIC VIEWS FROM THE CROW'S NEST SUMMIT
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW AND IT IS FORTY YEARS AGO RICHARD DAWKINS PUT FORWARD HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION IN HIS BOOK THE SELFISH GENE THE IDEA HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL AT THE TIME WAS THAT THE GENE ITSELF WAS THE MAIN DRIVER OF NATURAL SELECTION NOT THE SPECIES ALL THE INDIVIDUAL PLANT OR ANIMAL WHILE I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT THE GIANT LEAPS FORWARD THAT SCIENCE HAS MADE IN UNDERSTANDING OF GENETICS
THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM IS THE UNIT OF NATURAL SELECTION AND OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM IS THE THING THAT ACTUALLY DOES THINGS IT WALKS IT RUNS IT SEES ITS ARSE IT IT IT IT IT HUNTS IT RUNS BUT THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM IS JUST A ONE OFF IT DIES
IT REPRODUCES AND REPRODUCTION IS PRODUCING NEW JEANS AND SO IF YOUTH WHO OR RATHER PRODUCE REPRODUCING GENES THAT WERE THERE BEFORE SO
NATURAL SELECTION REALLY SHOULD BE SEEN FROM THE GENE POINT OF VIEW THE GENES GO ON THROUGH THE GENERATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE GENES THAT SURVIVE THROUGH MANY GENERATIONS OTHER ONES THAT ARE GOOD AT IT AND GOOD AT IT MEANS GOOD
BUILDING INDIVIDUALS THE BAD GENES HAVE ALL DISAPPEARED AND THAT IS NATURAL SELECTION IN THAT CASE WHY AREN'T WE ALL EVEN BETTER ARTISTS HERE MICHAEL ANGELO I WAS CLEVERER THAN EINSTEIN WHY ARE WE CONTINUING THE WORK OF OR WHY I DON'T KNOW LIONS RUN INFINITELY FAST THAT ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE THERE ARE COSTS YOU CAN'T HAVE PERFECTION BECAUSE WHAT'S GOOD IN ONE DEPARTMENT OF LIFE IS NOT GOOD IN ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OF LIFE IF SAY A HORSE
HE'S BRED TO RUN FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER THEN ITS LIMBS TEND TO BREAK OR IT'S BAD AT IT MAY BE GOOD AT RUNNING THROUGH OPEN COUNTRY BUT IT'S VERY BAD AT RUNNING THROUGH FORESTS AND THAT KIND OF THING ALWAYS COMPROMISES AND IF YOU PUT THAT INTO A HUMAN CONTEXT
I'M ALWAYS RELUCTANT TO PUT HIM BACK IN THE PROBLEM HUMANS AREN'T SO UNUSUAL ANYWAY WE NOW LIVE
FAR REMOVED FROM THE CUTTING EDGE OF WHAT WAS NATURAL SELECTION WE STILL HAVEN'T ACROSS ELECTION BUT OF A RATHER DIFFERENT KIND SO IT'S NO LONGER IN GREAT HUNTERS AND FISH THAT'S RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT'S NO LONGER IMPORTANT TO BE GREAT HUNTERS AND FISSURES AND AND ESCAPERS FROM PREDATORS BECAUSE WE GET WE GET LOOKED AFTER BY CIVILISATION OUR FOOD HE'S GOT FOR US WE GO TO THE SUPERMARKET RATHER THAN GO HUNTING OR DIGGING
FOR IT SAYS IT'S QUITE HARD TO TO BRING THAT SORT OF INSIGHT INTO INTO MODERN HUMAN YOU CAN DO IT FOR OUR ANCESTORS ON THE AFRICAN PLAINS
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE ARE BEGINNING TO DO IS EDIT A GENUS SO THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE ILLNESS YES THAT IS TRUE AND IT'S AN EXCITING POSSIBILITY IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT EDITING HE'S REALLY MADE IT LATE ILLNESS THAT'S AND THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO AND NOBODY HAS ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT
WHAT PEOPLE DO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT HIS EDITING GENES TO MAKE YOU BETTER AT RUNNING OR JAI EUGENICS AFFECTED EUGENICS I MEAN THEORETICALLY YOU COULD NOT JUST EDIT GENES TO BUILD THE CHAMPION HIGH JUMPER FOR THE OLYMPICS HAVE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TIME YOU COULD DO THAT WE COULDN'T INDEED BREED I MEAN YOU COULD ACTUALLY
IF MALE HIGH JUMPERS MARRIED FEMALE HIGH JUMPERS FOR ENOUGH GENERATIONS YOU COULD DO IT AS WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY UNEASY ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING AND FOR GOOD REASON ARE YOU WELL YES AND NOT LEAST FOR THE REASON I'VE ALREADY SAID THAT IF YOU BREED FOR BEING GOOD AT THE HIGH JUMP
YOU'LL FIND THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY BRED FOR THE BAD THINGS AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE BUT BUT A CHAMPION A SUPER CHAMPION HIGH JUMPER WHO COULD JOE COULD JUMP
YOU KNOW MANY FEET HIGHER THAN ANYBODY CAN TODAY WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE DEFECTIVE IN IN OTHER RESPECTS ON A MUCH MORE PROSAIC LEVEL THOUGH IF ONE WANTED TO CHANGE THE GENE SO THAT ONE HAD A BABY WITH BLUE EYES INSTEAD OF BROWN EYES
YOU COULD DO THAT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY UNEASY ABOUT THAT ALSO UNEASY ABOUT SAY
BREEDING A MATHEMATICAL GENIUS OR A MUSICAL GENIUS AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HITLER WANTED TO DO AND SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING THAT HITLER WANTED TO DO WENT AUTOMATICALLY SUSPICIOUS
IT'S IN A WAY A LITTLE BIT CURIOUS THAT WEAR MORE SUSPICIOUS OF CRYING TO BREED A BRILLIANT MUSICIAN THEN ME ART OF FORCING A CHILD TO DO FIVE FINGER EXERCISES FOR MANY HOURS PER DAY AND THERE ARE PARENTS AMBITIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHO WILL DO THAT
AND SO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE ON A CHILD IS NOT REGARDED WITH THE SAME SUSPICION AS AS AS THE GENETIC PRESSURE TO TO BREED A PERFECT MUSICIAN WHY NOT YOU THINK I THINK PARTLY BECAUSE BECAUSE OF HITLER AND
THERE'S A SORT OF FEELING THAT BUT BUT BREEDING ALL GENETIC MANIPULATION YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING FOR THE DISTANT FUTURE WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IN A WAY THAT MERELY TRAINING FORCING A CHILD TO LEARN TO BE A BRILLIANT MUSICIAN EVEN AGAINST ITS WILL THAT ONLY LASTS FOR ONE GENERATION
YOU'VE HAD A MILD STROKE YES HOW ARE YOU YOU LOOK VERY WELL IT WAS IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR AND I
I THINK I'M PRETTY MUCH RECOVERED BY CROAK A BIT SOMETIMES I CAN'T SING WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM BUT THEY ARE REGARDED AS A SORT OF LITMUS TEST OF WHERE MY RECOVERY WILL BE COMPLETE WHEN I CAN AGAIN SING IN TUNE IN THE SHOWER
I SHALL REGARD MYSELF AS RECOVERED YOU WOULDN'T CARE TO SING FOR US NO ABSOLUTELY NOT I ASKED ME BACK IN SIX MONTHS' TIME MAYBE I WAS GOING TO SAY WHEN YOUR VOICE IS FULLY RECOVERED COME BACK CAN SEEM TO US THEN AND I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME OVER THE SPEAKING TO YOU WITHOUT SO FAR ANYWAY MENTIONING GOD AND I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MENTION GOD BECAUSE GOD DELUSION WAS ONE OF YOUR GREAT BESTSELLERS YOU'VE GOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF FLAK FOR IT
INEVITABLY THAT WAS PARTLY THE OBJECT I'M SURE NO REGRETS ABOUT WRITING IT ALL NO IT'S HIS TENTH ANNIVERSARY I NO REGRETS AT ALL I WOULDN'T TAKE BACK ANY OF IT IT IS THE BEST SELLING BOOK OF I'VE WRITTEN IT IT SOLD THREE MILLION COPIES RIGHT AND SO BUT I'M NOT IN THE LEAST ASHAMED OF IT I STAND BY IT AND AFTER YOU HAD YOUR OWN AS YOU DIDN'T SAIL PLEASE GOD HELP ME NOT TO DIE OR SOMETHING
ABSOLUTELY NOT MY GET WELL SOON COMPLETELY WELL YOU DO AS THEY LOOK REMARKABLY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IN THE SPEAKER AND A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE NOVELIST AND COLUMNIST AND NAPKINS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MICHELLE DONNA RICHARD
THE ARCHITECT ARGUED THAT HIS WAS THE OLDEST PROFESSION AND SINCE THE FIRST THING MAN DID WAS FIND THE CAVE THE GARDENER DISAGREED SIGHTING ADAMS THERE'S EVEN EARLIER BEFORE MAN NEEDED SHELTER NONSENSE TOPPED THE POLITICIAN BEFORE THE GARDEN THERE WAS CHAOS WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE MADE THAT FEWER THAN ONE PER CENT OF YOUNG PARENTS WERE TAUGHT GARDENING IN SCHOOL AS AGAINST FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR PARENTS' ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL HOLTY CULTURAL SOCIETY
AN ASTONISHING DECLINE IN ONE GENERATION CONSIDERING THE UNIVERSAL JOY OR GARDEN BRINGS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF HUSBANDRY TO SURVIVAL AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PLANTS TO EVERYONE IF ONLY IN A POT ON THE WINDOWSILL THE FIRST THING I DO EVERY MORNING IS SMILE SINCE A FRIEND PLANTED OUR WINDOW BOXES
I WAS INTRIGUED TO HEAR ON THE RADIO OVER THE WEEKEND GARDEN DESIGNER JULIET SERGEANT MY MUM SHE SAID GAVE ME A LITTLE PATCH IN THE GORDON CORNER OF THE GARDEN AND SAID HERE'S YOUR BIT THAT'S WHERE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN AYE SHE PRACTISED MEDICINE FOR FOUR YEARS BUT AS FASCINATING AS MEDICINE IS SHE WENT ON I MISSED THE CREATIVITY
HER FAMILY INTENSE VALUING EDUCATION SAW HER CHANGE OF CAREER AS A STEP DOWN IN A DIFFERENT WAY I WONDER IF WE ARE SOMETIMES CLASS BOUND SEEMING TO PREFER OUR CHILDREN TO FACE UNEMPLOYMENT WITH A DEGREE THAN MANUAL FULFILMENT WITHOUT
SURELY EVERYONE LOVES A GARDEN IF NOT GARDENING ITSELF THE WRITER SUE LYN TOLD ME THAT SHE'D FINALLY GROWN UP WHEN SHE LEARNT TO LOVE GARDENING I ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK TO TALK ABOUT TO ANYONE
IT WAS SHE WHO TAUGHT ME MANY YEARS EARLIER WHEN TUTORING ME FOR UNIVERSITY THAT THE ELIZABETHANS APPRECIATED A FORMAL GARDEN SEEING IT AS TAMING THE FORMIDABLE FORCES OF NATURE MY MOTHER LIKED TO TELL OF THE VICAR WHO COMPLEMENT IT A KEEN GARDENER COMMENTING ON HIS MARVELLOUS TEAMWORK WITH THE ALMIGHTY HUMPH SAID THE CURMUDGEONLY PARISHIONER YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS GARDEN WHEN THE ALMIGHTY HAD IT TO HIMSELF
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TEAM WORK TO MY MIND WHICH IS EVEN MORE GLORIOUS THAN NATURE ALONE THIS AFTERNOON A FRIEND IS TREATING ME TO THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW AND I'M FAR MORE EXCITED EVEN IF WE WERE GOING FOR A LOVELY WALK IN UNTENDED COUNTRYSIDE THE INVENTIVENESS OF GARDENERS CAN BEHIND WITH THE ASTONISHING CREATIVITY OF GOD HIMSELF I FIND THE COMBINATION SECOND TO NONE
AND IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN TRANSFORMED INTO A CITY NOT A WILD FOREST OR SAVAGE MOUNTAINSIDE THAT JOHN IN REVELATION DESCRIBES WHAT WE CALL PARADISE THE VERY WORD MEANING PARK OR WALLED GARDEN
MORE SIGNIFICANT STILL IS MARY MAGDALENE IS APPARENT MISTAKE ON EASTER MORNING SHE'D SEEN HER FRIEND AND TEACHER JESUS PUT TO DEATH TWO DAYS BEFORE SO UNDERSTANDABLY CONFRONTED BY A MAN PERHAPS UNFAMILIAR IN HIS PHYSICAL PERFECTION SHE FAILS TO RECOGNISE HIM WHO DOES SHE DO YOU WHAT JOHN SAYS SHE TOOK HIM FOR THE GARDEN
AND SO HE IS COME TO UNDO THE DAMAGE DONE BY HIS PREDECESSOR ADAM AND RESTORE THE GARDEN OFF EARTH AS IT WAS CREATED TO BE
SO I THINK FOR THE GARDENER
GARDENING OFTEN THE FIRST THING A CHILD CAN LEARN AND LAST ANIMAL PERSON CAN ENJOY THE MOST IMPORTANT OCCUPATION OF ALL
TO HAVE THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH ATKINS THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EAT THE PRICE OF A EUROPEAN HOLIDAY FOR FOUR THIS SUMMER COULD RISE BY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS IF THERE IS A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. NEXT MONTH THAT WILL BE THE THRUST OF TODAY'S MESSAGE FROM DAVID CAMERON WHEN HE SPEAKS TO EASYJET EMPLOYEES LATER AND THE AIRLINES CHIEF EXECUTIVE CAROLINE MCCALL WILL BE ALONGSIDE HIM ARGUING FOR A VOTE TO REMAIN WHEN I SPOKE TO HER A SHORT TIME AGO I ASKED IF SHE AGREED WITH THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUND FIGURE
I THINK THAT FIGURE IS BASED ON THE POUND WEAKENING AGAINST THE EURO GIVEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN POST BREAKS SO IT'S A PLAUSIBLE FIGURE I THINK I THINK IN THE ROUND WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT
IT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD THING IF YOU'RE IN AIRLINES OR TRAVEL TO SAY THAT THE E.U. HAS BEEN GOOD FOR PASSENGERS BECAUSE FARES HAVE GONE DOWN BY FORTY PERCENT AND THE CHOICE OF DESTINATIONS HAVE GONE UP BY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT SOFA AND WE HAVE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED ROUTES ACROSS THIRTY ONE COUNTRIES AND WE FLY
FREELY ACROSS ALL THOSE COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF THE COMMON AVIATION AREA AGREEMENT SO I THINK
AT THE MACRO LEVEL WE AGREE THAT THERE WOULD BE PRESSURE ON FAIRS BECAUSE ANY RESTRICTIONS VISA REQUIREMENTS CONTROLS RESTRICTIONS THAT ADDS COMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON COSTS AND THAT WOULD AFFECT FARES IT WILL GIVE US AN IDEA THEN OF HOW MUCH THE AVERAGE EASYJET FAIR WOULD BE AFFECTED
HOW MUCH WOULD IT GO ON I I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE NO ONE QUITE KNOWS WHAT SHAPE THIS WOULD TAKE IF THIS INDEED HAPPENED AND IT WOULD DEPEND ON ON WHAT'S WAS ABLE TO BE NEGOTIATED AFTERWARDS WHAT WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY IS THAT IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE
A VIEW BOTH THE SHORT TERM VIEW AND THE LONG TERM VIEW ABOUT HOW WE OPERATE IN A VERY CHANGED EURGH AND IT WOULD BE A VERY CHANGED EUROPE THAT MEANS YOU CANNOT SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT FARES WOULD GO UP IN THE EVENT OF BRECK'S IT
I THINK WE COULD SAY THAT IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT FARES WOULD GO UP BECAUSE
IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT TO WE WOULD HAVE TO IT WAS MORE COMPLICATED FOR FOUR FOR AIRLINES TO FLY FREELY ACROSS EUROPE WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FOR INSTANCE NEGOTIATIONS ON CERTAIN ROUTES WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS ON SLOTS THERE'S JUST ALL SORTS THINGS THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT TODAY WE JUST FLY ACROSS
EUROPE COMPLETELY WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS SO WOULD I KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE THAT IS A BENEFIT PASSENGERS AND IT WOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED FOR YOU AS AN AIRLINE HAVING TO OPERATE IN THAT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT BUT IT WON'T NECESSARILY MEAN FARES WILL GO UP YOU ALSO SAID THAT IT WOULD AFFECT THE CHOICE OF DESTINATIONS YOU COULD OFFER WHY WOULD I DIDN'T SAY WAS IT WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE IT WOULD HAVE SO WE WE AS I SAID HERE WE CAN OPEN UP ROUTES TO
ANYWHERE ACROSS EUROPE THAT IS IN THE COMMON AVIATION AREA AND YOU CAN TAKE SOME WE CAN WE CAN TAKE THOSE DECISIONS VERY EASILY IF WE AREN'T PART OF THE COMMON AVIATION AREA
IT BECOMES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE SEPARATELY FOR ROOTS WE DON'T KNOW AS I KEEP SAYING I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HERE IS WE DON'T KNOW THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE INSTABILITY THAT THAT CAUSES MEANS YOU HAVE TO THINK MUCH MORE DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO BEFORE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE E.U. THERE A PART OF THAT EUROPEAN COMMON AVIATION
BUT THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED THAT SEPARATELY AND THEY'VE PAID FOR THAT SEPARATELY AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD TO REPRESENT THEM SO AS I SAID IT BRINGS UNCERTAINTY AND THEY'RE FOR A DEGREE OF INSTABILITY TO THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN CAROLINE MCCALL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF EASYJET THANK YOU
AND CAROLINE MCCALL AND DAVID CAMERON I WILL BE SPEAKING LATER ON AT AND CAMPAIGN EVENT ON THE REMAINED SIDE OR ROB YOUNG OUR BUSINESS PRESENTERS WITH ME IN THE STUDIO SHE'S CAREFUL TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OR BRICKS IT WOULD BE FOR COMPANIES LIKE LIKE HERS BUT BUT ALSO CAREFUL ROB NOT TO SAY FOR SURE YES EASYJET FARES WILL GO UP YES THAT'S RIGHT WHAT'S THE OTHER
BUT THE BIGGEST LOW COST AIRLINE IN HERE HE'S BEEN MAKING A SIMILAR POINTERS AS WELL ABOUT THIS AND DO THEY GOT INTO A BIT OF HOT WATER OVER AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN THEY LAUNCHED LINKED TO THE REFERENDUM AS WELL AND SO AIRLINES ARE MAKING THE POINT THAT THEY SAY IT IS EASIER TO FLY WITHIN EUROPE MORE CHEAPLY THAN IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE WITH BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY
CITIES ACROSS EUROPE WHICH WILL STILL WANT TO ATTRACT LOTS OF BRITS WITH POUNDS IN THEIR POCKET SPENDING MONEY WHEN THEY GO TO FIND TO THEREFORE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THESE OTHER COUNTRIES AND EUROPEAN YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT UP BARRIERS WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR
AIRLINES FLYING FROM UNITED KINGDOM TO GO THAT THEREFORE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT PRICES WOULD NOT GO UP INDEED RYANAIR WHICH HAD ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS YESTERDAY SAID THAT IT IS PREDICTING OF THE NEXT YEAR THAT THE COST OF AIR FARES WILL WILL FALL PERHAPS ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT OR SO OVER THE NEXT YEARS IT AS THEY SEE AN AIRFARE WAR HOTTING UP BETWEEN VARIOUS AIRLINES IN EUROPE UNTIL IT IS CLEARLY A VERY UNCLEAR PICTURE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DETERMINANT
THEIR FEZ IS NOT NECESSARILY THE REGULATOR THE PICTURE WAS IN EUROPE HE DOES THE COST OF OIL AND AS WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AN AWFUL LOT OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF OIL IS AN AWFUL LOT CHEAPER TODAY THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO ROB YEUNG THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE WEATHER FILLED LOVELY DAY YESTERDAY NICE ONE TO DO
CERTAINLY FEWER SHOWERS WE CAUGHT ONE OF THOSE SHOWERS I WOULD SUSPECT THAT WOULD HAVE TEMPERED YOUR VIEW OF YESTERDAY JOHN THAT THAT WAS IN THE FORECAST ANN CAME TO PASS OF COURSE OF COURSE YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY NEVER THAT WELL INTO EASTERN ENGLAND FOR TODAY LET'S TRY HER LUCK TODAY SHOW HE'S NICKED AT VERGING ON THE RACING TIPS HERE EASTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND DRIVE FINE SUNNY START JUST WATCH OUT FOR ONE OR TWO FOG PATCHES COULD BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT HOUR OR SO SORT OF WEST NORFOLK DOWN TOWARDS STANDS THE WAY VALE OF YORK LOOKING A BIT TRICKY IN PLACES AS WELL
BUT EVENTUALLY WE'RE OFF AND RUNNING INTO A DECENT SORT OF DAY THE ONSHORE BREEZE FROM THE NORTH SEA THE NORTH EASTERLY STILL TEMPERING THINGS RIGHT ON THE COAST ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEGREES HERE BUT UPPER TEENS OR SO ONCE YOU COME JUST A FEW MILES INLAND SOMEWHERE IN THE LONDON AREA PROBABLY TWENTY DEGREES OUT WEST ENGLAND WESTERN ENGLAND AND ALL OF WALES WERE A DRY AND FINE DAY AFTER A CHILLY START HERE TO NOT SO MUCH IN THE WAY OF A FOAL PROBLEM
ONE OR TWO SHOWERS MAY JUST AFFECT NORTH DEVON NORTH CORNWALL MAYBE PEMBROKESHIRE DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON BUT THAT'S THE EXCEPTION TO A RULE AND AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT HIGHS CERTAINLY IN THE UPPER TEENS POSSIBLY A TWENTY SOMEWHERE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S A DRY DAY THROUGHOUT OLDER THOUGHT VARIABLE AMOUNTS OF CLOUD BUT NOT TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OF BREEZE SO AGAIN SOME WESTERN PARTS COULD SEE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN DEGREES AND FINALLY TO SCOTLAND WHILE RATHER DANK SORT OF START TO THE DAY
ACROSS THE NORTH EAST A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUD HERE THIS WILL BREAK WITH TIME FOR MANY OF YOU THE WEST SEEING THE VERY BEST OF THE SUNSHINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THOUGH JUST THE CHANCE OF A SHOWER AND A HIGH OF EIGHTEEN PHIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW LET'S LOOK AHEAD TO SATURDAY ON B.B.C. TELEVISION
IN THIS WEEK'S WORLD I'LL BE FOCUSING ON A SINGLE PROMINENT GLOBAL ISSUE EACH WEEK REALLY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF ITS EFFECT ON ORDINARY LIVES IN THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK ON THE B.B.C.

M.P.S HAVE SAID THE ANTI MALARIAL DRUG LARRY UM SHOULD BE USED BY THE ARMED FORCES ONLY IN THE MOST EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE OF ITS SIDE EFFECTS AND A PROMINENT SCIENTIST HAS CALLED FOR THE BAN ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS TO BE REASSESSED THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL SLEET
OPPONENTS OF PLANS TO CARRY OUT HYDRAULIC FRACKING TO EXTRACT SHALE GAS IN NORTH YORKSHIRE SAY THEY WILL FIGHT TO THE DECISION TO ALLOW A COMPANY TO USE THE CONTROVERSIAL PROCEDURE FRIENDS OF THE EARTH IS CALLED THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S APPROVAL OF AN APPLICATION BY THE FIRM THIRD ENERGY DISGRACEFUL THE ON SHORE ENERGY INDUSTRY HAS WELCOMED IT AS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD WHILE THE COMPANY ITSELF HAS SAID IT WANTS TO HOLD OUT AN OLIVE BRANCH AND WORK WITH THE PROTESTERS HE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HARBIN
MINISTERS ARE BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT THEIR FAVOURED ENERGY TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY A LOCAL COUNCIL AFTER A WAIT OF NEARLY FIVE YEARS THEY SAY FRACKING IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TAX REVENUES FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE BLOCKS OF LAND ACROSS THE U.K. ALLOCATED FOR ONSHORE DRILLING BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF A SHALE GAS BOOM
FIRMS WILL NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY CAN PRISE THE GAS OUT OF BRITAIN'S STUBBORN ROCKS FOR AN ECONOMIC PRICE AND THEY'LL FACE CONTINUED RESISTANCE FROM THE PUBLIC WHO SURVEYS SUGGEST VAPOUR WIND AND SOLAR POWER NOT NUCLEAR AND SHALE GAS
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ARE PONDERING A JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE DECISION IN RYEDALE OTHER CAMPAIGNERS WHO SAID THEY'LL FIGHT ON BECAUSE THE PROJECT CREATES TOO MUCH DISTURBANCE AND BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T SHOWN HOW SHALE GAS CAN FIT WITH ITS POLICY ON CLIMATE CHANGE
THE GREEK AUTHORITIES HAVE BEGUN AN OPERATION TO REMOVE MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES FROM A CAMP AT IT ARE MANY NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING THERE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN THE HOPE OF BEING ALLOWED TO TRAVEL NORTH THE OPERATION TO TRANSFER THEM TO OTHER BETTER ORGANISED FACILITIES IS EXPECTED TO TAKE SEVERAL DAYS CORRESPONDENT YOLANDE MEL REPORTS FROM IT

THE GREEK AUTHORITIES SAY THAT RESIDENTS INCLUDING LARGE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN WILL BE MOVED TO A NEWLY COMPLETED ORGANISED CAMPS WHERE ASYLUM CLAIMS CAN BE PROCESSED HOWEVER MANY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO LEAVE MANY PREFERRING TO STAY IN SIGHT OF THE BORDER
SINCE LAST YEAR OVER A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ENTERED THE EUROPEAN UNION ILLEGALLY MOST TRAVELLING FROM THE TURKISH COAST TO THE GREEK ISLANDS THE MAJORITY COME FROM SYRIA IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND GOT STUCK IN GREECE AFTER OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SHUT THEIR BORDERS
A GROUP OF M.P.S HAS ACCUSED THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE OF FAILING TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES WHEN PRESCRIBING CONTROVERSIAL ANTI MALARIAL DRUGS TO SERVICE PERSONNEL MATH LE QUINN ALSO NAMED BY ITS BRAND NAME LARRY UM HAS BEEN LINKED TO DEPRESSION PANIC ATTACKS AND HALLUCINATIONS
THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE SAID IT WAS DEEPLY DISTURBING THAT SOME OF THE ARMED FORCES APPARENTLY THREW AWAY THE DRUG A LAW FIRM REPRESENTING SEVERAL ARMED FORCES VETERANS SAID LARIM HAD RUINED LIVES AND IT WOULD CONTINUE TO PURSUE LEGAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE M.O.D. MORE DETAILS FROM SCENIC ATTACHED
TODAY'S REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DESIGNATE LARRY EM AS A DRUG OF LAST RESORT AND THAT IT SHOULD BE ONLY PRESCRIBED TO THOSE PERSONNEL WHO ARE UNABLE TO TAKE ANY OF THE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS DOXY CYCLONE AW MALA OWN JULIAN LEWIS IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE AND SAYS SOLDIERS WHO'VE TAKEN THE DRUG HAVE EXPERIENCED DISTURBING NEUROLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS
IN REALITY THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DEEPLY UNPLEASANT SO MUCH SO THAT PHRASES LIKE MAD MONDAY ALL CRAZY TUESDAY ARE USED AMONGST THE ARMED FORCES WHEN THIS STUFF HAS BEEN DOLED OUT IN THE PAST
THE COMMITTEE ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF FAILING IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY NOT FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES ISSUED BY THE DRUGS MANUFACTURERS ROCHE WHICH SAY THAT FACE TO FACE MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BEFORE ANYBODY HE'S GIVEN LARRY IT RECOMMENDS THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BECOME COMPULSORY
OFFICIAL FIGURES SHOW AT LEAST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND BRITISH TROOPS WERE PRESCRIBED LARRY AND BETWEEN APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND MARCH TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN ROCHE HAVE AGREED WITH THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS WHILE THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS MOST PERSONNEL ARE TAKING OTHER MEDICATION BUT WHEN LARRY AND IS PRESCRIBED IT SHOULD BE AFTER A RISK ASSESSMENT
BRAZIL'S INTERIM GOVERNMENT HAS LOST ONE OF ITS KEY MINISTERS LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT AFTER TAKING OFFICE FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRESIDENT WHO SET A NEWSPAPER HAS PUBLISHED AUDIO HER MARROW YOU CAR DATING FROM MARCH IN WHICH HE APPEARS TO SAME AS RECESS IMPEACHMENT WOULD STOP THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CORRUPTION INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STATE OWNED OIL FIRM PETRA BRAT
MY CAR WHO'S A CLOSE ALLY OF THE INTERIM PRESIDENT MICHELLE TIME AIR IS TAKING A LEAVE OF ABSENCE JULIA COME ERROR REPORTS FROM RIO
IN A CONVERSATION WITH HER FELLOW POLITICIAN IMPLIED HE WOULD ACT TO DATURA THE MASS OF CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS KNOWN AS THE CAR WASH SCANDAL A BILLION DOLLAR BRIBERY SCHEME WHICH ALLEGEDLY INVOLVES DOZENS OF POLITICIANS INCLUDING HIMSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE P.M. DIGBY
NOW GOVERNING PARTY IN BRAZIL IN THE LATE MY SAID THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT ZUMA HERSELF WAS NECESSARY TO STAUNCHED THE BLEEDING AND THAT A POLITICAL PACT HAD TO BE REACHED TO START THINGS WHERE THEY WERE SITTING PRESIDENT MICHEL THERE MIA HAS BEEN INSISTING HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS BUT THE LEAKED IDEAL REINFORCES SCEPTICISM HERE MY LOOK OUR SAID HE HAD NOTHING TO HIDE AND THE QUOTES WERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT
DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE FEARED TO BE BURIED UNDER A LANDSLIDE AT A REMOTE JADE MINE IN NORTHERN MYANMAR AND OFFICIAL IN CATCHIN STATE SAID AT LEAST ELEVEN BODIES HAD BEEN PULLED FROM THE DEBRIS AT THE MINE
A LEADING SCIENTIST HAS CALLED FOR THE BAN ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS IN EUROPE TO BE REASSESSED THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY PROFESSOR DRINKY RAMA KRISHNA SAID THAT G.M. CROPS HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD AND IT WAS NOW TIME TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT
HIS COMMENTS COINCIDE WITH THE PUBLICATION BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF A GUIDE TO G.M. TECHNOLOGY FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC A SOIL ASSOCIATION SAID IT BELIEVED THE PAMPHLET WAS NEITHER NEUTRAL NOR UNBIASED BECAUSE IT FAILED TO MENTION SCIENTIFIC OPPOSITION TO G.M. OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT POWERED GOATS REPORTS
FOR DECADES PROTESTERS HAVE CLAIMED G.M. CROPS ARE BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND POSSIBLY HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH AS A RESULT THEY'RE NOT ON SALE IN SUPERMARKETS NO G.M. CROPS ARE COMMERCIALLY GROWN IN EUROPE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAS SAID THAT THE CURRENT BLANKET BAN SHOULD BE REASSESSED PROFESSOR THANK YOU RAM KRISHAN AND SAYS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS SAFE AND HAS MANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS
HE ACKNOWLEDGES HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY THAT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WILL USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MONOPOLISE FOOD PRODUCTION AND THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF THOUSANDS OF VARIETIES OF FRUIT VEGETABLES AND CEREALS
THE TUNISIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K. NOR BE LAMAR IS URGING THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO CHANGE ITS GUIDANCE WERE BRITISH TOURISTS WHICH CAUTIONS AGAINST ALL BUT ESSENTIAL TRAVEL TO THE COUNTRY THE ADVICE HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THIRTY ONE BRITISH HOLIDAY MAKERS WERE KILLED IN TWO TERROR ATTACKS LAST YEAR FIGURES FROM THE TUNISIAN TOURIST BOARD SHOW A NINETY PERCENT FALL IN BRITISH VISITORS FOR THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THIS YEAR
THE FOREIGN OFFICE SAYS IT RECOGNISES THE KNOCK ON EFFECT OF ITS TRAVEL ADVICE BUT SAYS THE SAFETY OF BRITISH NATIONALS IS ITS MAIN CONCERN MY MA SAYS THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IMPROVEMENTS INSECURITY SINCE LAST YEAR
WE UNDERSTAND THAT NO BRITISH SIDE HAS TWO TO HAVE THEM THE SECURITY OFFICE CITIZENS FIRST
FIRST PRIORITY BUT YOU ALSO SAYING THAT THESE LAWS YOUR RISK NOWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THAT
THE EFFORTS AND THE GOOD RESULTS THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF IMPORTANCE ARE GOOD IT SHOULD BE TAKEN
GOD IN THE TRIBAL AND
ANIMAL RIGHTS CAMPAIGNERS CLAIM THE DOG FIGHTS ARE TAKING PLACE DAILY ON BRITISH STREETS UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATORS WORKING FOR THE LEAGUE AGAINST CRUEL SPORTS SO THEY WERE OFFERED DOGS WHICH COULD BE TRAINED TO FIGHT A GROUP IS DEMANDING TOUGHER PENALTIES FOR OFFENDERS REGISTER OF BAND OWNERS AND A REVIEW OF THE DANGEROUS DOGS ACT
THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES IN AUSTRALIA HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL SPEND MORE THAN A MILLION POUNDS TO RELOCATE A TROUBLESOME BAT POPULATION MIGRATORY FLYING FOXES HAVE DESCENDED ON THE TOWN OF BATEMANS BAY CAUSING RESIDENTS TO COMPLAIN THEY'VE BEEN MADE PRISONERS IN THEIR OWN HOMES FROM SYDNEY FILM MERCER REPORTS
NATIVE TREES IN BATEMANS BAY FLOWER THIS SEASIDE TOWN IS INVADED BY LARGE COLONIES OF BATS THEIR DROPPINGS IN CONSTANT SCREECHING ARE INFURIATING RESIDENTS WHO WERE DEMANDING THAT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND GREY HEADED FLYING FOXES BE MOVED ON
THEY COULD BE BOMBARDED WITH LOUD INDUSTRIAL NOISE ALONG WITH SMOKE AND BRIGHT LIGHTS GIANT INFLATABLE TUBES USED OUTSIDE CAR SHOWROOMS IN AT FUNFAIRS COULD ALSO BE BROUGHT IN TO SCARE THE BATS AWAY
THE FLYING FOXES ARE LISTED AS A VULNERABLE SPECIES SO AUSTRALIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN GIVEN SPECIAL PERMISSION TO TRY TO FORCE THEM OUT OF BATEMANS BAY
ILLNESS OR REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT ALL DRUGS WE'RE TOLD HAVE A SIDE EFFECT OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER IT'S A QUESTION OF BALANCING THE RISK AGAINST THE BENEFIT IN THE CASE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN SERVING IN OUR ARMED FORCES THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE HAVE GOT THAT BALANCE DANGEROUSLY WRONG THAT'S WHAT A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S HAD SAID ABOUT THE USE OF AN ANTI MALARIAL DRUG CALLED LARRY AND THEY'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING IT FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND THEY CONCLUDED
THAT IT SIDE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO SEVERE DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL ILLNESSES THEY ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF FAILING IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY PRESCRIBING THE DRUG TO BRITISH TROOPS BEFORE CARRYING OUT THE RIGHT HEALTH CHECKS
WE COULD THATCHER HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A BIT OF BACKGROUND SEEMA JOHN YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR ON THIS PROGRAMME WE DID A COUPLE OF PIECES ON THIS DRUG AND IT'S CONTROVERSY JUST TO REMIND YOU OF THE LISTENERS AT HOME HERE'S SOME BACKGROUND NOW LARRY AND IS SOMETIMES GIVEN TO BRITISH TROOPS SERVING OVERSEAS BUT ITS CRITICS HAVE ARGUED IT'S LINKED TO MENTAL ILLNESS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND THEY SAY IT'S PARTICULARLY BAD
FOR PERSONNEL SERVING IN WAR ZONES WHERE THEY'RE MORE VULNERABLE TO MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS NOW IN AUGUST WE REVEALED THAT A SENIOR MILITARY MEDIC HAD CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP PRESCRIBING LARRY UM UNTIL IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SAFE AND IT WAS AFTER THIS JOHN THAT THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED AN INQUIRY MICK WALLIS USED TO BE A MAJOR IN THE ARMY HE SAYS EVER SINCE HE TOOK LARRY I'M ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO HE'S BEEN SEVERELY DEPRESSED
TOOK THE DRUG IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN I WAS DEPLOYED TO CLEAN YOUR NEXT SIZE GRAND PRIX WHEN I GOT HOME MY WIFE SAID I WASN'T THE SAME MAN I WAS SHORT TEMPERED DEPRESSED
ANXIOUS AT TIMES OF MISERABLE IT'S REALLY I JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S STILL GOING ON I'M STILL ON ANTI DEPRESSANTS I HAVE BEEN SUICIDAL AT TIMES I'VE GOT A BOMB OR USE AS A WORKSHOP AND WHEN I WENT INTO THE BAR I COULDN'T STAY IN THERE I WAS SO OVERWHELMED BY THE FEELING THAT I HAD TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE BUT I JUST HAD TO IMMEDIATELY LEAVE I JUST COULDN'T STAY IN
I'VE HAD SEVERAL COURSES OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS AND READ ALL THEY DO IS STICK A PLASTER OVER IT AND SOON AS I STOP TAKE THE MOST ONLY GO DOWNHILL AGAIN IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD WORK I'VE LACKED ENTHUSIASM TO DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A STRUGGLE
DATE HAS BEEN STRONG EVIDENCE THAT HIM HE'S BEEN UNSAFE FOR QUITE SOME NUMBER OF YEARS AND JUST WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF TAKING LARRY UM AND SEAM OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT MONITOR EXACTLY THE QUESTIONS EXAMINED BY THE COMMITTEE YES THAT'S RIGHT JOHN THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT THE M.O.D. AS YOU SAID IN YOUR INTRO HAS FAILED
IN ITS DUTY OF CARE BY GIVING THE DRUG TO SOLDIERS WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES FROM ITS MANUFACTURERS ROCHE NOW RUSH HAVE ALWAYS SAID THOSE GIVEN THE DRUG MUST ONLY BE GIVEN AFTER A MEDICAL CONSULTATION TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE NO PRIOR NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS THE COMMITTEE SAYS THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING PLACE
AND IT NOW RECOMMENDS THAT THE DRUG SHOULD NOT BE USED EXCEPT IN THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS NOT BEING ABLE TO TOLERATE ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVE DRUGS I THINK WHAT THIS IS LIKELY TO DO JOHN IS GAVE AMMUNITION IF YOU LIKE TO THOSE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE TAKEN THE DRUG AND EXPERIENCED DEVASTATING SIDE EFFECTS TO NOW TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S TURN TO THE SURGEON GENERAL AND HE'S QUITE NEAR THE JOB CERTAINLY JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES BUZZ HAD ALISTAIR WALKER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING JEAN DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THE MILITARY THE M.O.D. HAS FAILED IN ITS DUTY OF CARE
JOHN WE HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT HER PERSONAL FROM MALARIA WE WELCOME THE COMMITTEE'S CONCLUSION BUT THERE THE SOME CASES LARRY WILL BE APPROPRIATE THIRD PLACE GROG LET ME PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE THOUGH THERE'S ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MILLION CASES OF MALARIA A YEAR HALF A MILLION PEOPLE DIE FROM MALARIA
AND IN THE BRITISH MILITARY DESPITE THE FACT WE SENT PEOPLE TO
HEAVY MALARIA AREAS WE'VE ONLY HAD A DEATH SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ONE DEATH IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN RECENT YEARS THE LAST NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE NOT HAD THEIR DEATHS SO WE ARE TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY BUT THAT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION DOES IT BECAUSE THEY ARE
OTHER DRUGS ANTI MALARIAL DRUGS THAT YOU COULD USE AND INDEED HAVE BEEN USING DOXY CYCLING MALA OWN UP TO THE FACT THAT BRITISH SOLDIERS DON'T GET MALARIA IS PROOF THAT DRUGS WORK IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR USING LARRY WHICH IS DANGEROUS
ALL THESE DRUGS UNFORTUNATELY LIKE MANY OTHER DRUGS AND OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS SO FOR SOME PEOPLE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO TAKE DOTS IF CYCLIN OR MALLORY
AND IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE LIABLE TO BE EXPOSED TO MALARIA THEN WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO USE METAL OR QUEEN WEAR APPROPRIATE WITH LARRY
YES LARRY WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ROCHE THE DRUG THAT MAKE YES BUT WHAT ROCHE SAY IS THAT THE IT SHOULD NEVER BE PROSCRIBED UNLESS YOU INTERVIEW THE PERSON TO WHOM IT IS BEING DESCRIBED THE PROSCRIBE BEFOREHAND AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN HAPPENING IN EVERY CASE
WELL OF COURSE I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE CASE BUT
THE POLICY IS ON THE POLICY I'VE DRIVING WITH ALL MY PRIMARY CARE STAFF THE G.P.S THE PRESCRIBING THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A PROPER RISK ASSESSMENT MADE OF THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY DEPLOY AND THAT THE
INFORMED CONSENT TO TAKE THE DRUG IS THERE YEAH BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT THAT THE COMMITTEE MAKES THE DEFENCE ELECTED THEN HE MAKES THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN HAPPENING AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND THAT IS WHY YOU'VE NOT BEEN PURSUING YOUR DUTY OF CARE ABOUT THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT AND THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION AND I KNOW WHETHER YOU HEARD ME TALKING TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE DURING LOUIS ARAGON HE CAN SEE ABSOLUTELY NO JUSTIFICATION FOR USING THIS DRUG AT ALL
THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE WELL THAT'S WHAT HE DID TO ME WELL THE COMMITTEE DID SAY THAT WITH CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WELL CONTROLLED LARRY AND COULD BE PROSCRIBED AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE THAT DRUG OUT OF OUR ARMAMENT PERRIAM IS AN EFFECTIVE ANTI MALARIAL HE THINKS IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF YOUR ARMOURY
WELL HE AND I WOULD DISAGREE AND THAT I THINK UNDER VERY CLOSE CONTROL WITH VERY CAREFUL ASSESSMENTS THEN LARRY I'M STILL IS AN EFFECTIVE DRUG BUT IT HAS TO HAVE THAT KRYSTLE THE FROM THAT FRONT LINE DRUG IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO TAKE THE OTHER DRUGS AND THAT IS THE POINT ISN'T IT YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS MORNING CLEARLY YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE YOU'RE NOT EVERYWHERE ALL THE SAME TIME YOU CAN'T
ASHORE US THIS MORNING THAT EVERYBODY WHO HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED THIS DRUG HAS HAD THAT PROPER HANDS ON ONE TO ONE ASSESSMENT BUT FOR HAVING IT
ALL I CAN SAY IS THE POLICY THOSE REQUIRE PEOPLE AND WE'VE TIGHTENED THAT POLICY EVERY TIME THE DRUG COMPANY HAS REASSESSED THEIR POLICIES WE'VE ALSO PUT MEASURES IN PLACE SAW THAT
PEOPLE PRESCRIBING THE DRUG HAVE A WARNING ABOUT THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT TO ASK WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO DO
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE A DEFINITE PRESCRIBING THE DRUG AT THE RIGHT WHATEVER LET ME JUST INVITES HIM TO COME BACK AND ON THAT POINT YUP SIMMER AND SUCH A GENERAL JUST A QUESTION FOR YOU IS UM IS THIS AN ADMISSION LIKE JOHN SAID THAT YOU HAVE FAILED IN YOUR DUTY OF CARE BECAUSE THE SERVICE PERSONNEL THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO
I HAVE TOLD ME ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED THAT THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS DIDN'T TAKE PLACE BEFORE TWENTY THIRTEEN SO WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO DO TO THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED NEUROLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND NOW IN SOME CASES SUICIDAL
OR WE WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYBODY WHO THINKS THEY'VE GOT SYMPTOMS RELATED TO ALLOW HIM TO COME FORWARD AND LOOK FOR THEIR STANCE ALL WOULD NOT ALL OF THEM HOW WE'VE NOT HEARD FROM ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HEAR FROM YOUR REPORTS FOR IN THE SYSTEM SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THOSE FROM HERD WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT SORT OF IT IN THE SERVICE AND STILL SERVING TO COME THROUGH THROUGH THEIR OWN MEDICAL CENTRES TO DECLARE THAT YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM
LAWS THAT HAVE LEFT THE SERVERS TO GO THROUGH THEIR G.P. BACK TO US SAINT THE FANS I'M WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ARE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THAT IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO I MEAN IT ISN'T INEVITABLY THE SUSPICION THAT THE M.O.D. IS NOT SAYING WE'LL GET RID OF THIS STRUGGLE TOGETHER
BECAUSE IF IT DOES THAT IT IS ACCEPTING CULPABILITY WHO WILL AID PEOPLE WHO MAY FEEL THEY HAVE GROUNDS TO SUE BUT COS THEY HAVE BEEN MISTREATED IN THIS RESPECT IT MAY ENCOURAGE THEM TO SUE
NO IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SAYING THAT WICK GETTING KICKED IN THE DRUG BECAUSE OF THAT SITUATION WE NEED TO KEEP THE DRUG AS PART OF THE ALBUM KYRIAN THEY'RE A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SOUNDS TO PUT A LOT OF DRUGS AND LAUREN'S A GOOD DRUG THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CHOOSE TOLD LARRY PREFERENCE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY DON'T GET ANY SIDE EFFECTS FROM IT I THINK IT'S THE BEST OF THE ULTRA RIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT TO CARRY ON DOING WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN EFFECT
NO WE'RE GOING TO CHECK I THINK WE COULD PICK THE RECOMMENDATIONS LOOK AT THEM VERY CAREFULLY AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE
WALKER MANY THANKS THE TIME IS NOW TRYING TO JOG PAST EIGHT THE MAN WHO SPENT YEARS AS ONE OF DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST ADVISERS INCLUDING AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS TIME IN GOVERNMENT FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREES WITH HIM ON MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION STEVE HILTON BELIEVES WE SHOULD VOTE TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE SAYS BRITAIN IS UNGOVERNABLE WITHIN THE E.U.
HE NOW RUNS THE INTERNET START UP CROWD PACK WHICH AIMS TO HELP VOTERS IDENTIFY CANDIDATES THAT MATCH THEIR BELIEFS AND HIS BOOK MORE HUMAN IS JUST OUT IN PAPERBACK HE'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING MORNING SHELF IN THE PIECE YOU WROTE IN THE DAILY MAIL YOU ROUTED YOUR VIEW ON LEAVING THE E.U. ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AT NUMBER TEN YOU SAID THAT OR YOU FOUND THAT THIRTY PER CENT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION WAS RELEVANT TO WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE REST WAS GENERATED FROM WITHIN THE CIVIL SERVICE MACHINE THE MAJORITY COMING FROM THE E.U.
IS HE WAS ESSENTIALLY THEN AN ARGUMENT FOR SMALLER GOVERNMENT IS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE I THINK THAT IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT I THINK THAT IT'S ACTUALLY IF YOU TAKE A LONGER TERM VIEW OF IT IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THAN THE DAILY REALITY OF THE OF THE BURDEN THAT IT IMPOSES ON ON THE ACTIVITIES OF GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT WHAT I'VE REFLECTED ON SINCE LEAVING GOVERNMENT IS WHY IS WHY IS IT THAT IN SO MANY AREAS WHETHER THAT'S THE STRUGGLES PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES
THE FACT THAT THEIR INCOMES DON'T SEEM TO GO UP AND IN THEIR LIVING STANDARDS ARE STAGNATING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PERSISTENT POVERTY ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD FOR DECADES ACTUALLY THEY NEVER SEEM TO GET BETTER AND IT'S DRIVING HIS FRUSTRATION PEOPLE HAVE WITH GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS IN GENERAL AND THEY FEEL THAT WHOEVER THEY VOTE FOR NOTHING MUCH SEEMS TO CHANGE AND MY CONCLUSION IS THAT THEY'RE PARTLY RIGHT THAT ACTUALLY WHOEVER'S BEEN IN OFFICE THE SAME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN POWER
AND BY THAT I MEAN I KIND OF TECHNOCRATIC ELITE OF BANKERS BUREAUCRATS AND ACCOUNTANTS WHO REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS ELECTIONS IN WHICH COUNTRY'S PUSH A PARTICULAR AGENDA THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE CENTRALISATION OF POWER THE CENTRALISATION OF ECONOMIC POWER IN THE HANDS OF FEWER AND FEWER BIG BUSINESSES AND ESSENTIALLY ISATION OF POLITICAL POWER AND I THINK THAT WHAT THAT MEANS
IS THAT PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE THINGS THAT MATTER TO THEM AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM WE HAVE A CHANCE TO STRIKE A DECISIVE BLOW AGAINST THESE FORCES THAT HAVE SO DEHUMANISED A MODERN WORLD AND ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO FEEL THE WAY THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING WILL OVERNIGHT SEE THEIR LIVES IMPROVE WILL THEY THAT BUT NO LONGER WILL THEY BE CONTROLLED BY THIS THIS ELITE
UNACCOUNTABLE UNDEMOCRATIC GROUP OF BANKERS AND THE OTHERS YOU'RE DESCRIBING DEFINITELY NOT I WOULD BE I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE ARGUMENTS WE WE'RE SEEING THIS DEBATE ARE FAR TOO SIMPLISTIC AND I DON'T WANT TO FALL INTO THAT TRAP THIS IS A REALLY LONG TERM QUESTION A DECADES LONG QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO ORGANISE OUR AFFAIRS AND HOW WE WANT TO LIVE
SO WHAT I'M ARGUING IS THAT THE DIRECTION THAT WE'VE ALLOWED THINGS TO DRIFT IN THE LAST FEW DECADES IS TOWARDS FURTHER AND FURTHER CENTRALISATION AND THAT IS DELIVERING BAD CONSEQUENCES IN THE ECONOMY IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN OUR POLITICS NOW TO REVERSE THAT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME BUT THAT IS THE BIG CHANGE THAT WE CAN MAKE BY SAYING WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THESE PEOPLE TELLING US WHAT TO DO WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF POWER BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US IN BRUSSELS BECAUSE OF HOW CHRISTIAN BRUSSELS MUCH AS CROSS BUT THE POINT ABOUT THIS IS ABOUT THE E.U. ISN'T IT YOU SAID IT WANTED IT IS BUT I BUT THE POINT IS THERE IS A BINARY CHOICE TO MAKE HER ABLE REMAIN AND YOU'VE COME OUT ON THAT I HAVE AND I THINK THAT THE REASON IS THAT IT IS A SUCH A STRONG EXAMPLE OF THIS UNACCOUNTABLE CENTRALISATION
BUT HAS BAD CONSEQUENCES BUT IT'S NOT JUST IN BRUSSELS AND THAT'S THE ARGUMENT I MAKE IN MY BOOK IS THAT THE SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES WE'VE DESIGNED TO RUN THE MODERN WORLD HAVE JUST BECOME TOO BIG AND BUREAUCRATIC AND DISTANT FROM THE HUMAN SCALE NOW BRUSSELS AND THE E.U. IS A REALLY REALLY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THAT BUT THEY SET ABOUT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE IF ANY ONE PART OF THE OF VIEW ISSUES AND THE ODD WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD THE ODD WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING FORWARD FOR THE THE LEAVES SIDE
IS WHAT DAVID CAMERON WOULD CALL IMMORAL HE SAYS THE MORAL CASE IS TO REMAIN IN THE Y. YOU OTHERWISE WHERE IS THE MORALITY FOR PUTTING EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE AT RISK FOR SOME UNKNOWN I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY UNHELPFUL THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS DEBATE IS THE AGA IS THE IDEA THAT
RISK IS ALL ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR SOMEONE WHO ARGUES FOR LEAVING ME THAT THAT COMES WITH A RISK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EXACTLY LIKE THAT ALWAYS DEALING IN THE E.U. IS A RISK AS WELL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR YEARS FOURTEEN YEARS TWENTY FOUR YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITH THE E.U. THE E.U. RIGHT NOW IS A SINKING SHIP ECONOMICALLY NOW DAVID CAMERON HAS GIVEN US A LIFELINE AND I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT BUT THERE'S BITS TO PRETEND THAT THERE'S NO RISK
IN STAYING IS COMPLETELY MISLEADING BUT IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS THE WEIGHT OF ECONOMIC OPINION IS ON THE SIDE OF OF REMAIN I DON'T ACCEPT THAT AT ALL I THINK THAT THE I.M.F. THE BANK OF ENGLAND THESE ARE THE EXACT PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOCRATIC ELITE OF BANKERS AND BUREAUCRATS AND ACCOUNTANTS THE MORE THAT PEOPLE ON THEIR REMAIN SIDE WHEEL OUT THESE
THESE ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES THE MORE THEY MAKE MY POINT THAT YOU'D EASILY PEOPLE YOU KNOW BUT I KNOW THEM WELL EXCITED AND ALL OF THAT I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DO I'M SAYING THAT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES WHEELED OUT TO SUPPORT THE REMAIN IN THE E.U. CAMPAIGN DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MEAN THAT THERE IS ECONOMIC ARGUMENT ON THEIR SIDE IT JUST MEANS THAT THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE RUNNING THE WORLD FROM THEIR FIRST CLASS
FLIGHTS ALL AIRLINES AND AND STAYS IN FIVE STAR HOTELS AND SUMMIT MEETINGS WHERE THEY FLIT AROUND AND THINK THAT THEY CAN TELL THE REST OF US WHAT TO DO YOU SAY THAT DAVID CAMERON HAS HAS GIVEN A LIFELINE PRESUME YOU MEAN BYE BYE OFFERING THIS THIS A CHOICE EVEN THOUGH HE'S HE'S ARGUING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THAT YOU ARE HAS HE GONE TOO FAR ON THE RHETORIC OF FEAR WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM TO TO BE MORE TO BE MORE CAREFUL
I THINK THAT BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE TREATING PEOPLE LIKE SIMPLETONS THIS IS A COMPLICATED ARGUMENT THERE'S A BALANCE OF RISKS AS I JUST SAID ON BOTH SIDES AND IT'S WORTH GOING THROUGH THEM CAREFULLY IN IN DETAILED FRANKLY THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO A CROWD PACK WHERE WE WE'VE GOT A TEST THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE WHERE WE ACTUALLY TAKE YOU THROUGH THE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS AND ASK YOU TO WEIGHT THEM WHEN I DID MY OWN TEST ON MY OWN COMPANY'S WEBSITE I DON'T COME OUT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT FOR LEAVE EVEN THOUGH THAT'S MY STRONG VIEW
SHE CAME OUT AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND THAT IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT A SIMPLISTIC ISSUE IT'S FOR THE LONG TERM AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE A SERIOUS ARGUMENT ABOUT IT NOT THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM BOTH CAMPAIGNS RIGHT NOW STEVE HILTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT ARE WE BEGINNING TO WITNESS THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR ISLAMIC STATE THE MURDERER'S ORGANISATION IS LOOKING LESS AND LESS LIKE A STATE CONTROLLING EVER GREATER SWATHES OF TERRITORY IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND IS FIGHTING FOR ITS VERY EXISTENCE A CORRESPONDENT JIM MUIR IS WITH A SHIA MILITIA THAT'S ATTACKING I S.

THE TIME IS NOW AT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE CHRIS DENNIS IS HERE WITH THE SPORT MORNING MICHELLE YES AFTER YEARS OF SUCCESS AND STABILITY UNDER SIR ALEX FERGUSON MANCHESTER UNITED ARE SET TO APPOINT THEIR THIRD MANAGER IN AS MANY YEARS HAVING FINALLY CONFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF LOUIS VAN HIRE LAST NIGHT UNITED HER EXPECT TO INSTALL CHOSE HIM AS THEIR NEW MAN IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO BUT IS THE RIGHT CULTURAL FIT FOR UNITED AND WERE RYAN GIGGS STAY ON AS ASSISTANT LET'S SPEAK TO DAVID MEET RESPECTED JOURNALIST WHO'S COVERED UNITED'S HIGHS AND LOWS
SINCE THE MUNICH AIR DISASTER WAY BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT DAVID GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CHRIS HOW HAS THIS WHOLE THING'S BEEN HANDLED BY MANCHESTER UNITED YOU THINK WELL I THINK THEY DRAGGED IT OUT TOULON THE FOUNDERS AND I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T ALLOW FANS TO RUN YOUR CLUB BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S BEEN A GROUND SWELL
AND ANTICIPATE EVENT BECAUSE IT INTRODUCED SUCH A BORING
STERILE TYPE OF FOOTBALL THAT EVEN THEIR EX PLAYERS WERE TURNING ON IT SO THEY ALLOWED IT TO DRAG ON TOULON IN RIGHT
AND SHOULD RYAN GIGGS DAY WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM TO DO WELL
RYAN IS AN ICON OF BEEN A BIT PUZZLED AS TO WHAT HE'S CONTRIBUTED UNDER THE REGIME SITTING THERE WITH HARDLY MOVING A MUSCLE DURING
DURING MATCHES AND I THINK HE'S BEEN PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE TO THE DUTCH COACHES WHO INSTINCTIVELY WERE THE ONES TO CLOSEST TO SO EASY IS IT IS A BIT OF A NO MAN'S LAND
A SORT OF TOKEN GESTURE IF YOU LIKE TO THE OLD DAYS SO I THINK HE SHOULD STAY IS IF HE'S WILLING TO OF COURSE HE MIGHT HAVE HIS OWN AMBITIONS AND REALISE THAT IF HE'S GOING TO GET ON IN THE GAME
ER HE'S GOT A LEVEN PROVE HIS CREDENTIALS AS A MANAGER YES WELL AS WELL AS THE BORING FOOTBALL YOU MENTION KARL'S ARROGANCE HAS BEEN QUOTED AS A FACTOR IN HIS DISMISSAL SO UNITED NOW TRYING OF COURSE TO THE THE SHRINKING VIOLET THAT IS HOW MUCH OF A RISK WILL THAT BE WILL HAIRS AND THOUGHTS OF THE FORMER UNITED GOALKEEPER PETER SHH MICHAEL
MANCHESTER UNITED ONE DAVID WILL FROM A CULTURAL POINT OF VIEW WILL MARINE YO BE THE RIGHT FIT WELL RATHER THAN THE SPECIAL ONE OR THE HAPPY ONE DISEASE DUBBED HIMSELF I THINK HE'S NOW THE TRICKY ONE
AND THERE THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF HIGH RISK IS PETER SAYS ABOUT APPOINTING HIM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S A HIGH RISK SITUATION THAT MANCHESTER UNITED FIND THEMSELVES IN IT'S NOT EASY REPLACING A LEGEND AND I WAS AROUND WHEN SIR MATT BUSBY RETIRED
AND I WATCHED WILF MCGUINNESS LAST FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS I WATCHED FRANK O'FARRELL LASTS FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BOTH GOT THE SACK AND IT WAS YEARS BEFORE THEY GOT THEIR SHIP IN IN IN ORDER AND I CAN SEE THE SAME HAPPENING AGAIN IN A WORD DAVID BRIEFLY HOW LONG DO YOU THINK RING WILL STAY ASSUMING OF COURSE HE'S APPOINTED

JOIN ME CLAUDIA HAMMOND HERE FOR ALL IN THE MIND ON B. B. C. RADIO FOUR THIS EVENING AT NINE O'CLOCK THE WEATHER MOSTLY DRY AND SUNNY AGAIN TODAY CLOUDIER TOMORROW
YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE AND NEIL SLEET HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS OPPONENTS OF FRACKING IN NORTH YORKSHIRE SAY THEY'LL FIGHT ON AFTER THE FIRM THIRD ENERGY WON PERMISSION TO EXTRACT SHALE GAS IN RYEDALE FRIENDS OF THE EARTH CALLED THE DECISION BY COUNTY COUNCILLORS DISGRACEFUL THIRD ENERGY SAID IT WAS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THE WORK WOULD BE SAFE
GREECE HAS BEGUN AN OPERATION TO MOVE MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES FROM A CAMP NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER TO BETTER ORGANISED FACILITIES ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING AT INTO MANY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THEIR PASSAGE NORTH WAS STOPPED
M.P.S HAVE SAID THEM AT ANTI MALARIAL DRUG LARRY AND SHOULD BE USED BY THE ARMED FORCES ONLY AS A LAST RESORT BECAUSE OF ITS SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE SAYS LARRY HE WAS GIVEN AFTER A RISK ASSESSMENT THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE BRITISH ARMED FORCES VICE ADMIRAL ALISTAIR WALKER TOLD THIS PROGRAMME HE HAD TIGHTENED POLICIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE ASSESSMENTS TOOK PLACE BUT THE DRUG WAS AN EFFECTIVE ANTI MALARIAL FOR THOSE WHO COULDN'T TAKE OTHER MEDICINES
A MINISTER IN BRAZIL'S NEW GOVERNMENT IS STEPPING ASIDE AFTER HE WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE ALLEGEDLY CONSPIRING TO OBSTRUCT THE COUNTRY'S BIGGEST CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION COMMANDOS WHO CAR SAYS HIS COMMENTS WERE TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THE ELECTION THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FIRST FAR RIGHT HEAD OF STATE HAS INSTEAD PRODUCED AN AUSTRIAN PRESIDENT FROM THE GREEN PARTY ALEXANDER VANDA BELEN NEITHER OF AUSTRIA'S TWO MAIN CENTRIST PARTIES MADE IT TO THE RUN OFF STAGE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
AND ACROSS EUROPE FAR RIGHT A NATIONALIST PARTIES HAVE BEEN MAKING ELECTORAL GAINS DENMARK FINLAND HUNGARY AND FRANCE WHERE THE NATIONAL FRONT ONE NEARLY SEVEN MILLION VOTES IN LAST YEAR'S REGIONAL ELECTIONS WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM BRUSSELS BY THE GERMAN GREEN M.E.P.S SCAR KELLER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE GREEN GROUP IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE REASON FOR THAT TREND THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN RECENT ELECTIONS
THEY ARE OF COURSE SOME COUNTRY SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE RISE OF THE FAR RIGHT BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING SO WE CAN GENERALISE OR THAT WE CAN ALSO LEARN FROM THE AUSTRIAN EXAMPLE IN AUSTRIA WE HAD A QUIET CORRELATION THAT WAS RUNNING THE COUNTRY SINCE FOREVER BASICALLY AND THIS IS CAUSING EACH PROBLEM WHEN THE BIG PARTIES LET'S SAY
CANNOT BE ANY MORE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THE SAME POLICY THEY'RE ALWAYS IN THE SAME GOVERNMENTS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALSO SEE IN OTHER COUNTRIES START BUT IT'S NOT A TOYS ANY MORE BETWEEN LET'S SAY SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND CONSERVATIVE BLUSTER CONSERVATIVES AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS I TURNING FURTHER AND FURTHER TO THE RIGHT
HOPING TO GAIN VOTES FROM THE FAR RIGHT OR THE RIGHT WING POPULIST BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS STRATEGY BECAUSE BY THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMISING THEIR THE CLAIMS OF THE FAR RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD SAY INDEED I AGREE THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE THAT EVERYBODY WILL THINK O.K. THEN THERE MUST BE REALLY AN ISSUE BUT THEY WERE VOTE ORIGINAL ABOUT THAT BIT HAD AND IF THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING
THERE'S A BENEFIT TO PARTIES AT AT YOUR END OF THE SPECTRUM AND PARTICULARLY TWO GREENS ACROSS EUROPE YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ALEXANDER VAN DE IN THE GREEN CANDIDATE ENDING UP IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RUN OFF HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE RISE OF NORBERT HOPEFUL
INDEED THE GREEN SPEAKING THERE FOR STEADY STRONGEST A POST TO THE FAR RIGHT AND THAT AND BODY SO TO SAY THAT THE EXTREME OPPOSITE OF THE FAR RIGHT BECAUSE WHERE FIGHTING FOR A LIBERTARIAN SOCIETAL REVIEW FOR MORE WOMEN'S RIGHTS GAYS RIGHTS AND ALL OF THAT MORE
A CITY SENSE RIGHTS WE ARE SO TO SAY THE LIBERAL IMAGE FOR THE SOCIETY WHERE IS THE FAR RIGHT IS LOOKING AT AN AUTHORITARIAN PICTURE OF SOCIETY SO WHERE THE STRONGEST OPPOSITION TO DANCING BUT I REALLY HOPE WHEN ANY DO YOU BENEFIT FROM THAT FROM THE RISE OF THE PART OF THE FAR RIGHT WHAT'S A BENEFIT IF THEY'RE DEMOCRACY GO STANCE DRAIN INTO
WE HAVE SUCH CLOSE CALLS LIKE WE HAVE NOW IN AUSTRIA THAT BY THAT YES MAYBE THE GREEN PARTY IS WINNING AS THE STRONGEST OPPOSITION TO THE FAR RIGHT BUT I THINK WE HAVE A DEEPER PROBLEM OF THE FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY SO WE'RE REALLY NAZ YOU KNOW IN THE TEMPE MOOD SO TO SAY MORE
RELIEF THAT THINGS WENT WELL IN AUSTRIA BUT WE HAVE A REALLY DEEP PROBLEM THAT WE ALL NEED TO FACE ALL OF DEMOCRATIC PARTIES NEED TO FIGHT FOR MORE DEMOCRACY AND AGAINST EXTREME RIGHT SKULL KELLER ANY P. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE GREEK POLICE HAVE BEGUN AN OPERATION TO CLEAR THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS FROM THE HUGE YOU DO MANY CAMP NEAR THE MACEDONIAN BORDER WORLD GABRIELLI CASSINI IS A HUMANITARIAN OFFICE OF THE SAVE THE CHILDREN HE'S EFFECTIVELY BEEN LIVING THERE FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT'S HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK

WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS TO BE GRANTED
WE KNOW THAT IT'S IS MORNING AT SIX O'CLOCK MUST BE FULLY SUPPORT TO ME

LEAVE THAT TO CLAIM
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM ISN'T IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO STAY IN GREECE THEY WANT TO GET INTO MACEDONIA SO THEY CAN GO THROUGH MACEDONIA AND THEN GET TO OTHER COUNTRIES WERE WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT EVEN BE THIS COUNTRY WHO KNOWS AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM FOR THEM ISN'T IT
WHERE IT'S HOLLY RELIGHT IT WORKED THE DEAR VOYAGER IS GOING TO BE CLOSED AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY POSSIBILITY PUT THEIR MATCH OF THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM
SHOULDN'T WE AT LEAST TAKE THIS SHIP SO SHE SHOULD BE AT LEAST TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T MORE PEOPLE ENDLESSLY JOINING THESE ONLY DID THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH STOPPED NOW HAVE THEY THE NEW MIGRANTS ARE WELL DONE
WALKING
IS IT HOPELESSLY OPTIMISTIC TO SAY THE CRISIS THE PEAK OF THE CRISIS HAS PASSED AND THE TOUGH SUSS THINGS WILL START SETTLING DOWN WELL BECAUSE VERY DIFFICULT VERY LONG NO YOU DIDN'T NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM OR TO HAVE ACCESS TO ILLEGAL
BECAUSE HE KNEW MANY THANKS THE TIME IS NOW A QUARTER TO NINE THE SCIENCE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD AND IT IS TIME TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT SO SAYS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AFTER AN AMERICAN REPORT CONCLUDED LAST WEEK THAT G.M. FOODS WERE NO MORE RISKY TO HUMAN HEALTH AND OTHERS PROFESSOR BINKY RAMA KRISHNA AND HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIETY AND HE'S WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING MORNING AND YOU ARE CALLING FOR THE EUROPEAN BAN ON G.M. CROPS TO BE
REASSESSED YES WE THINK THAT AFTER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OF CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE GROWING G.M. CROPS ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF THE TERRIBLE LAND WORLDWIDE NOW AND TO G.M. CULTIVATION WE HAVE GATHERED QUITE A LOT OF EVIDENCE AND SO WE THINK IT'S TIME TO REVISIT THE ISSUE
AND MY VIEW IS THAT CHI EMMA'S SIMPLY A TOOL TO INTRODUCE TREATS INTO A PLANT YOU CAN USE YOU CAN DO THAT BY CLASSICAL GENETIC MANIPULATION NONE OF THE CROPS THAT WE HAVE TODAY HAD NATURAL THERE ALL THE PRODUCT OF CENTURIES OF SELECTION OR YOU CAN DO IT BY VERY PRECISE MODERN TOOLS SUCH AS GENETIC ENGINEERING
SO WHAT WE THINK SHOULD BE REGULATED IT'S NOT THE METHOD BUT THE TRAIT AND I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE WHEN A NEW CROP IS INTRODUCED TO ASK IS IT SAFE IS IT ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE IS SAFE THE HEALTH HAD SAID ARE YOU SAYING THAT G.M. FOOD IS SAFE
WE ARE SAYING YOU CANNOT SAY BLANK ATLEE WHETHER G.M. IS DANGEROUS OR OR A SAFE IT HAS TO BE DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BATES'S JUST AS WITH ANY OTHER CROP
WEATHER ALTHOUGH YOU SAID A MOMENT AGO THAT TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND SO MUCH PROPORTION OF THE WORLD'S AGRICULTURE IS SHOWING UP WITH THESE CROPS BECAUSE THOSE G.M. CROPS THAT HAVE BEEN USED HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY REGULATED THEY'VE BEEN TESTED THEY'VE BEEN OUT HEALTH TESTED ENVIRONMENTALLY TESTED BEFORE THEY WERE APPROVED FOR USE AND THEREFORE THE G.M. CROPS WERE SINGING HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS REGULAR TORY PROCESS AND WE ARE OR STRONG REGULATORY PROCESS
BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT METHOD SHOULD BECOME CONDEMNED IN A BLANKET WAY AS I SPEND THAT IN EFFECT YOU ARE SAYING THEN THE G.M. FOOD IS SAFE AT LEAST EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCED HUSBAND YES THAT'S TRUE AND I AM SAYING THAT THERE'S NOTHING INTRINSICALLY ABOUT THAT MAKES HAD UNSAFE O.K. SUE DO YOU THINK IT IS IT IS A PRACTICAL TO R. TWO
TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS ARE YOU SAYING THAT EVERY SINGLE TRAIT EVERY SINGLE NEW VARIANT OF A CROP THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED WOULD BE EFFECTIVELY LICENSED YES IT WOULD BE AND WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME WE DO THAT FOR FOODS WE DO THAT FOR DRUGS AND WE ACTUALLY DO IT FOR NEW VARIETIES OF PLANTS I DON'T SEE ANY REASON
WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT FOR GEUM THE SOIL ASSOCIATION TAKES HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW IT SAYS THAT THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING G.M. CROPS AND DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE EVIDENCE THAT IN THE GUIDE THAT YOU HAVE PUT FORWARD AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY YOU DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IS NO WE DID WE ACTUALLY DO AND THE THE FEW BITS OF THAT QUESTIONED THE SAFETY OF G.M. NOW MANY YEARS OLD AND WERE LATER SURE NOT TO BE SUBSTANTIATED BY EXTENSIVE STUDIES
SO OUR VIEW IS THAT OUR STUFF A REPORT OR THE SORT OF INFORMATION THAT WE PUT OUT IS ACTUALLY BALANCED IT DOES CONSIDER ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT REACHES IS IT IS YOUR VIEW ALSO ABOUT A NEED TO THE FEED THE WORLD ARGUMENT ESSENTIALLY FULL FOR G.M. THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE WORLD'S NEEDS WITHOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT WHEN WE ARE FACING A GROWING WORLD POPULATION AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT MORE FOOD BY TWENTY FIFTY WE CANNOT AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL OF THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL
AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY THAT YIELD THAT CAN BE IMPROVED BUT SHE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE NUTRITIVE VALUE FOR THEIR CROPS FROM BETTER QUALITY PROTEINS BETTER OILS FOR EXAMPLE OMEGA THREE OILS COULD BE INTRODUCED INTO CROPS
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT GOLDEN RICE WHICH IS STALLED AT THE MOMENT BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CURE OR PREVENT NIGHT AND IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME AND YET IT HASN'T ACHIEVED ITS POTENTIAL HASN'T ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THE MAGIC BULLET THAT THAT IT'S BEEN ACHIEVED PARTLY BECAUSE OF OPPOSITION TO ITS INTRODUCTION WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IS FOUNDED ON ANY EVIDENCE AND PARTLY UNTIL WE'RE ALLOWED TO
INTRODUCED THINGS ARE OUR EXPERIMENT WITH THINGS WE CAN'T IMPROVE THEM AND WERE CONSTANTLY LEARNING MORE ABOUT PLANT GENETICS AND SO THE POTENTIAL IS THERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND USE PROFESSOR THANK YOU I'M A CHRISTIAN AND PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TEN TO NINE THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES IN KENYA BETWEEN POLICE AND OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR FOURTH MONDAY IN A ROW DEMONSTRATIONS CALLING FOR THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION TO RESIGN BECAUSE ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION AND BUYERS WERE BROKEN UP BY THE AUTHORITIES AND LAST WEEK PROTESTERS WERE BEATEN BY RIOT POLICE THIS WEEK IT'S WORSE SOME WAS SHOT AT LEAST ONE MAN WAS KILLED ALL THIS HAPPENING IN SOME OF KENYA'S BIGGEST CITIES INCLUDING NAIROBI FROM ALISTAIR LEITHID REPORTS
THERE WERE RUNNING BATTLES BETWEEN ROCK THROWING DEMONSTRATORS AND TEAR GAS FIRING POLICE IN KIBERA NAIROBI'S BIGGEST SLUM AND OPPOSITIONS
I'M NOT YEAH YEAH THAT'S LET THEM DOWN WITH THEM BAMBOOS HAVEN'T WE SO THERE'S A MOMENT MORE
PROVOKED THE SOLDIERS OF RIOT POLICE
STOP THE MARCHING TO THE CITY CENTRE DEMONSTRATE OUTSIDE THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION I DON'T I DON'T
THE NEXT ELECTION IS MORE THAN A YEAR AWAY BUT AMID ALLEGATIONS OF BUYERS AND CORRUPTION THE OPPOSITION WANTS THE INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL AND BOUNDARIES COMMISSION I E. B. C. TO RESIGN I WOULD NOT
LOSING IS A DISEASE SHOULD BUT LIVE GIRL FEES ZOO VERY
NO ONE'S OFFICE FOR A LITERAL AND A BISTRO AND SYSTEMS AMONG HITLER'S HEAD ON THAT YOU ARE FREE SO LET'S GET THE MONEY
WHY THE BURNING TYRES AND ROCKS THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE RE GONNA EXPRESS
ALL THE POLICE AND OBVIOUSLY SEE THIS HUGE PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE FROM THE BURNING TYRES AND THE RIOT POLICE ARE BACKING SOME NUMBERS THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S NOW STARTING TO RUN AWAY IT'S TO HIS BACK AND CORK THE NICE ALL THE TIME
PROTESTS ARE NOT UNUSUAL IN KENYA AND THEY OFTEN INVOLVE CLASHES WITH THE POLICE BUT GIVEN THE VIOLENCE THAT FOLLOWED THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ELECTIONS WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED THERE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT POLITICAL DEMONSTRATION
THE POLICE SAID THE PROTEST WAS ILLEGAL AS PERMISSION HAVEN'T BEEN GRANTED THE GOVERNMENT CALLED ON THE OPPOSITION NOT TO WHOLE STREET PROTESTS
DEPUTY PRESIDENT WILLIAM ROUSSEAU THAT ANY POLICE OFFICERS WHO USED IN APPROPRIATE FORCE WOULD BE PUNISHED THE POLIS
WILL BE BROUGHT TO BOOK
LISTEN MEN WHO THIS JUG THAT RESPONSIBILITY THE JOB ADVISED THE RIGHTS OF OTHER
WILL FACE THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW CRIMINAL
