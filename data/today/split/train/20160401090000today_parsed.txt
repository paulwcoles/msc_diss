STARVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A FIRST LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND AS THE DEBATE GOES ON ABOUT THE U.K.'S STEEL CRISIS OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND THE TIMES ARE PICKING UP ON CRITICISM FROM U.K. AND E.U. OFFICIALS PARTICULAR FRENCH AND ITALIAN OFFICIALS THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS CRISIS BY LEADING OPPOSITION TO AN OVERHAUL OF ANTI DUMPING RULES THAT COULD HAVE HELPED RAISE RETALIATORY TERRORISTS IN THE E.U. TO THE TOUGH LEVELS
SEEN IN THE U.S. THESE ARE TARIFFS ON IMPORTS OF CHEAP CHINESE OR STEEL THIS IS THE MAIN STORY FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES WHICH SAYS THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN STEEL ASSOCIATION SAYS THE BRITAIN THWARTED ATTEMPTS TO SHUT OUT SHEEP STEAL FROM CHINA THE U.K.'S THE RINGLEADER IN A BLOCKING MINORITY OF MEMBER STATES THAT'S PREVENTING A EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSAL ON THE MODERNISATION OF EUROPE'S TRADE DEFENCE INSTRUMENTS WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE EUROPEAN STEEL ASSOCIATION LATER IN THE PROGRAMME
ONE FACE DOMINATES ALL THE FRONT PAGES TODAY RONNIE CORBETT'S WHO HAS DIED AND THE DAILY MIRROR HAS A SOUVENIR A TRIBUTE TO A GIANT OF COMEDY AND ITS ENTIRE FRONT PAGE TAKEN UP WITH A PHOTOGRAPH
RONNIE CORBETT THAT FAMILIAR SMILING FACES IN THE TIMES AS WELL ATTRACTED T.V. AUDIENCES OF TWENTY MILLION AS ONE HALF OF THE TWO RONNIES MARK LAWSON OF THE FRONT OF THE
GUARDIAN IS KINDNESS MODESTY AND HUMOUR MEANT HE WAS WELL LIKED OFF SCREEN AS WELL AS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE TELEGRAPH HER BELOVED COMEDY GIANTS AS MIRANDA HART I'LL ALWAYS LOOK UP TO YOU RONNIE AND THE DAILY MAIL SLAIN HIM MORE OF A TWIST DIDN'T HE ALSO DOMINATES THAT FRONT PAGE AND HIS JOLLY FACE IS THERE BUT THE DAILY MAIL COMMENT ON ITS FRONT PAGE IS ABOUT HIM NOT GETTING
TO BE KNIGHTED HONOURS ARE CONFERRED ON COUNTLESS CRONIES AND UNLESS WERE THE CELEBRITIES THE MAIL SAYS THAT HE NEVER BECAME SO RONNIE IS A TERRIBLE INDICTMENT OF A HOPELESSLY CORRUPTED SYSTEM ON THE DAY THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE COMES INTO EFFECT THE TELEGRAPH HAS A COMMENT PIECE FROM FRASER NELSON SAYING THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT IT WILL RENDER UNEMPLOYED THOSE WHOSE SKILLS ARE NOT
NINE POUNDS AN HOUR THAT IS THE FIGURE THAT IT WILL RISE TO WITHIN FOUR YEARS FRASER NELSON SAYS IT ALSO WON'T REALLY HELP THE POOR MOST AT THE BOTTOM WILL KEEP JUST ONE POUND OF EVERY THREE POUNDS THEY EARN THE REST GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT BY ATTACKS OR LOWER IN WORK BENEFITS AND HE SAYS A NEW ENEMY IS COMING IN THE FORM OF AUTOMATION MACHINES ABLE TO STACK SHELVES OR TAKE ORDERS IN RESTAURANTS IF THOSE MACHINES HAD LOBBY HE SAID THEY'D BE BEGGING FOR AN EVER HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE FOR HUMANS
AND STORING THE TIME AS THAT SUGGEST THAT PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR ARMS ARE RISKS FROM TERRORIST THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HE'S QUITE REGULARLY REPORTED ON CERTAINLY USED TO BE THE CASE OF THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE THEY WERE UNCONCERNED OR AT LEAST THEY THOUGHT THAT ALL PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE SAFE THEY'RE A PAIR NOW TO BE NEW FEARS AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE TIMES ON ITS FRONT PAGE ABOUT THE VULNERABILITY
OF BATTLEFIELD NUCLEAR WEAPONS SMALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH COULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS
THE TIME IS NOW COMING UP TO ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX THIRTY EIGHT ORGANISATIONS IN GREATER MANCHESTER COME TOGETHER TODAY AS IT BECOMES THE FIRST ENGLISH REGION TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVOLVED HEALTH SERVICES A REFUND SURREY B. B. C. NORTH WEST POLITICAL EDITOR IS ON THE LINE AND HOW IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE HOW HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED
WELL I THINK WE WAIT TO SEE MICHELLE BUT EVEN THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST THIS PLAN IN THERE ARE A FEW SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY
MAJOR SHAKE UP OF THE WAY IT'S ALL DELIVERED I THINK THE IS CREATING A NEW BOARD THIRTY EIGHT ORGANISATIONS ON IT AND THE QUESTION WILL BE TO WHAT EXTENT THEY CAN CHANGE PRIORITY SO THAT RATHER BEING SET FROM LONDON THEY'RE SET LOCALLY AND LOCALLY IN GREATER MANCHESTER THEY HAVE
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRIORITIES BECAUSE THEY SAY HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE REGION ARE NOT AS GOOD AND CHANGING THE WAY THAT THE MONEY SPENT WILL ALLOW THEM TO TACKLE THOSE AND THEY'LL ALSO BE THE SUSPICION THAT THIS IS JUST ABOUT COST CUTTING THAT THEY'LL BE EFFICIENCIES THAT HAVE MADE WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP BETWEEN YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE IN IN THE ORIGINAL DIFF THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ORGANISATIONS DID THOSE JOBS MIGHT GO
YES I THINK ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS ABOUT COST CUTTING A TWO BILLION DEFICIT PREDICTED BY TWENTY TWENTY ALSO PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS BOARD IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TRANSPARENT AND THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT IT'S DOING ONE OF THE BIG CRITICISMS BUT YOU HEAR FROM N. PEAS IS THAT THESE ORGANISATIONS WHICH IS YOU SAY ALREADY EXIST THERE THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM A MIX OF LOCAL COUNCILS AND N.H.S. TRUST
ALREADY DOING THOSE JOBS AND THEY'VE GOT INTO A ROOM THEY'VE CREATED A NEW BOARD BUT NOBODY'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY UP TO BUT WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THEY ARE HUGELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS RATHER THAN BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND ACTUALLY WORK IN A MORE CO WAVE MAY HAVE EVER HAVE DONE BEFORE AND NOT JUST ABOUT HEALTH
NOT JUST ABOUT SOME KIND OF N.H.S. RECONFIGURATION BUT ACTUALLY TAKING HEALTH WHY DID THAN THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THEIR TARGET IS GETTING MORE CHILDREN READY FOR THE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEING HEALTH NOT NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN HOSPITALS BUT ABOUT THE WIDER PERSPECTIVE AND IT'S QUITE IN THAT SENSE QUITE A RADICAL AND POTENTIALLY FUNDAMENTAL
REORGANISATION OF THE WAY THAT HEALTH IS DELIVERED TO THE TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE HAVE GREATER MANCHESTER ARE OFFENCE SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME THIRTY MINUTES PAST SIX OCCUR FOR H. I. V. NOT YET BUT WE'LL HOPE ABOUT A NEW TECHNIQUE TOM FILLED INTO SCIENCE EDITOR ANISE HERE AND IT'S A TECHNIQUE TOM THAT DOES WHAT
WELL IT IS A FASCINATING PIECE OF RESEARCH PROBABLY SAYS AS MUCH ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL OF GENE EDITING AS IT DOES ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF OF THE H.I.V. VIRUS
ONE OF THE CLEVER THINGS THAT VIRUS DANCE TO HIDE IS TO INSERT ITS D.N.A. INTO THE JUNE INTO THE GENOME OF OF HUMAN HOST CELLS SO WHAT THESE RESEARCHERS HAVE ACTUALLY DONE IS TO USE THE CRISPER GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGY WE'VE BEEN HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT IN IN RECENT MONTHS TO IDENTIFY WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING AND THEN TO CUT OUT
THE VIRAL D.N.A. USING MOLECULAR SCISSORS BUT THE REALLY CLEVER THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE CRISPER MOLECULE STAYS THERE REMAINS ACTIVE IN THE CELLS THE VIRUS CAN'T THEN RE INFECTED
AND THIS IS NOT A CLINICALLY USABLE THING BUT THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY AS THAT THAT IS THE NEXT STEP ONE DAY I DON'T THINK IT'S THE NEXT STEP BUT HE'D MIGHT MIGHT COME TO SOMETHING ONE DAY I MEAN THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS
THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE LAB THEY'VE DONE IT IN A PETRI DISH UNDER VERY VERY CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH HUMAN CELLS BUT BUT STILL IN A VERY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TO THE STAGE OF USING LABORATORY ANIMALS RATS OR MICE YET SO WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM THE FRONT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS
AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE INTERFERING IN A HUMAN GENOME
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTIVE MOLOKO YOUR CRISPER MONICA WILL STAY THERE AND CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE ARE PROTECTING THE CELL
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AN AWFUL LOT OF SAFETY WORK TO FIND OUT WERE ONE OF THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IS IT REALLY ONLY GOING TO DO THIS JOB OR IS IT GOING TO START DOING SOMETHING ELSE AT SOME LATER STAGE THAT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A VERY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION BEFORE THIS GOES FORWARD BUT IT IS REALLY EXCITED AND WE WILL TALK TO AN ATTIC EXPERT ON THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF GENE EDITING AFTER HOPPER STATE TOM FELT UNTAXED
IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX THE BUSINESS SECRETARY WILL MEET STEELWORKERS IN PORT TALBOT TODAY INSISTING THE GOVERNMENT IS ON THEIR SIDE TONY BECKETT HAS MORE ON THAT IN OUR BUSINESS NEWS THIS MORNING TANYA AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU MICHELLE YES IT'S BEEN A REALLY DIFFICULT WEEK FOR THE U.K. STEEL INDUSTRY BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGEY JOBBY HAS CUT SHORT A VISIT TO SYDNEY TO RETURN TO THE U.K. FOLLOWING THE SHOP DECISION BY THE INDIAN CONGLOMERATE TATA TO SELL ITS U.K. ASSETS AND THAT OF COURSE INCLUDES
A GIANT PLANT IN SOUTH WALES THOUSANDS OF JOBS THERE AND ELSEWHERE ARE NOW HANGING IN THE BALANCE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO IS MICHAEL NOT IN THE STUDIO I APOLOGISE FROM CATS BUSINESS GO DOWN THE LINE IS MICHAEL TIME BACK AS HE'S PROFESSOR OF COMMODITY TRADE AND FINANCE THERE AND ALSO IN THE STUDIO WE HAVE OUR MARKETS GUESS SIMON FRENCH CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR PAN MEAL GORDON WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU MICHAEL LET'S START WITH YOU WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS I GUESS THE GOVERNMENT CAR PUT IT BACK TOGETHER TO HELP ANY POTENTIAL BUYERS OF
PUFFED OUT THERE STEAL THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE STEEL INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT IN PARTICULARLY GOOD SHAPE THERE'S A LOT OF OVER SUPPLY IN THE MIKE IT'S COMING FROM CHINA OF COURSE BUT ALSO THE DEMAND IS NOT QUITE THE RIGHT BUT STILL INDUSTRY SAYS THE OVER SUPPLY AS YOU PUT IT FROM CHINA IS IN FACT COOL DUMPING AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED LONG AGO
UP TO A CERTAIN EXTENT OF THESE AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN QUITE A STEEP I HUNTED DUMPING CLERKS THEY YOU HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN DOING THIS PERHAPS HE WILL DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING
BUT THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE CHINA HAS EXPANDED MASSIVELY SINCE PERHAPS TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WENT OUT THERE ACTUALLY ACQUIRED CAUSE AND CURRENTLY LIVES NOT ENOUGH ABSORPTION IN ITS OWN CALL ON HIM HE'S JUST EXPORTING AND EXPORTING AT VERY LOW PRICES
BECAUSE THIN BUT SUBSIDISED SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT YES WE CAN GO HEAD TO HEAD AND IMPOSE DUMPING DUMPING TAX AND OTHERS AS I SAID SIMON FRENCH IS WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO SIMON TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK WE CAN ATTRIBUTE THIS TO
CHEAPER LABOUR COSTS AND SO ON IN CHINA AND TO WHAT EXTENT SIMPLY MOVES IN THE COMMODITY MARKETS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY I THINK THE
BOTH BOTH ACTS AS A KEY BUT THE MOST MATERIAL DATA POINT FUR TUTTA STEEL IS THAT WHEN THEY BORE CHORUS AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN
THE WHOLESALE PRICE FOR STEEL WAS APPROACHING A THOUSAND DOLLARS A TONNE AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED SO WHEN YOU HAVE RUN A BUSINESS WHERE YOU OR YOUR OUTPUT FOR THE PRICE OF THAT FALLS BY MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OVER ERE OVER THE DECADE
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO REMAIN PROFITABLE AND SALES MARGINS HAVE MORE THAN HALVED GLOBALLY IN THE STEEL SECTOR AND THAT IS ALL DRIVEN BY HIGH CAPACITY INCREASES IN CHINA HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LAST DECADE AND THE INDIA BY SIXTY FOUR PERCENT MICHAEL TOM BACK IS IS THERE A CASE FOR SEEING STEEL PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY AS STRATEGIC AND THEREFORE NOT PURELY A QUESTION OF LOOKING AT IT FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW
YES PROVIDED HE PEES FOCUSED ON A LOT MORE WHAT WE CALL A HIGH VALUE STAYED SPECIALISED APPLICATIONS FOR DEFENCE FOR EXAMPLE FOR SPECIALISED STRUCTURES NOT JUST THE VERY STANDARD SORT OF MODIFIES THE STEEL WITH TIME THE VERY CHEAPLY IN EUROPE BRITAIN USES VERY CHIPPY AS WELL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE THERE RIGHT GO IT IS THAT WE SHOULD THERE HAVE BEEN THE CASE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS FOR EXAMPLE FOR PUT TRYING TO ADD MORE VALUE
ABSOLUTELY BUT AT THE TIME OF THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN EVERYTHING WAS GOING UP IN THE ECONOMY INCLUDING THE NEED FOR FOREPLAY A VERY STANDARD BUT NOW THIS IS NOT THE CASE I THINK FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN ONWARDS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IT IS STRUCTURING OF THE FOCUS OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY HERE
OBVIOUSLY BUT MY HAT SOME BUCKETS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE STILL HAVE SIMON WITH THIS HERE SIMON BIT WE SHOULD REMIND OURSELVES THAT THIS WAS A BUSINESS ONLY BOUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AT THAT TIME IT WAS CALLED CHORUS SO WHAT'S CHANGED
WHAT THE THE DEMAND THE BUSINESS WAS IN DEMAND THERE WAS A BRAZILIAN RIVAL ACTUALLY FOR BUYING IT BECAUSE THE INITIAL BID FOR CORA SHARES CAME IN AT FOUR POUNDS EARLY IN TWO THOUSAND SEX AND IT EVENTUALLY WENT FOR MORE THAN SIX IS BID UP BY MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT SUCH WAS THE DEMAND AND SUCH WAS THE INCREASE IN STILL PRICES AT THE TIME AND THE INSATIABLE DEMAND OF THE WORLD ECONOMY
BUT THE WORLD ECONOMY IS HIS REBALANCING NOW IT IS PARTICULARLY IN CHINA MOVE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM ITS TRADITIONAL HEAVY INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION LED GROWTH TORR MOR CONSUMPTION ECONOMY WHICH REQUIRES LESS STEEL AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE STILL FEELING THE LEGACY OF HUGE OVER SUPPLYING ACROSS COMMODITY MARKETS FROM FIFTEEN TWENTY A SUPER CYCLE
GOOD ANY OF THAT BEAN HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED A LITTLE BIT BETTER THOUGH AFTER ALL AS WE'VE SAID MANY JOBS ARE AT RISK
I THINK THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF MISINFORMATION FROM PALO FROM PLOT POLITICIANS OF ALL SIDES OVER THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE HISTORIC TREND OF STEEL PRODUCTION IN THE U.K. IT'S BEEN DECLINING SINCE THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES IT'S FALLEN BY MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OVER THAT PERIOD
INDEED YOU KNOW THAT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM THAT WE CONTROLLED FINGER POINTING RATHER THAN TRYING TO LOOK FOR A COHERENT INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY WHICH IS BASED ON A SIMPLE QUESTION IS THERE A STRATEGIC CASE FOR YOU CAISTEAL PRODUCTION REGARDLESS BITS PROFITABILITY IF THERE IS THEN THERE IS A ROLE FOR FOR GOVERNMENT THERE IS A ROLE FOR A BAIL OUT OF
UPTIGHT AND YOUR BELIEF IS THAT IT CAN BE DONE AFTER ALL THERE IS A PRESIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE TEND TO SAY THAT INTERVENTION SUBSIDIES AND SO ON ARE NOT ALLOWED THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PRECEDENTS ACTUALLY YOU LOOK AT BRITISH ENERGY INTO THOUSAND THREE LOOK AT M.G. ROVER YOU LOOK AT THE BANKS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND EASE STATE AID RULES ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE BUT THERE HAS TO BE THE POLITICAL WILL TO TAKE ON THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND
MAKE THE CASE FOR WHY IN IT IN THE U.K.'S BEST INTERESTS AND ALSO WHY IT REPRESENTS A TEMPORARY MEASURE TO GET THROUGH THE VAGARIES OF THE COMMODITY PRICE CYCLE RIGHT WHEN WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MARKET LET ME JUST ASK YOU ABOUT THE FIRST DAY OF THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER AND SOME PRETTY GLOOMY NEWS OUT OF JAPAN WHICH IS SENT THE MARKET I WOULDN'T SAY REALLY BUT IT'S DOWN TWO AND A HALF PER CENT BY LUNCHTIME
I SUSPECT THAT JAPANESE POLICY MAKERS WAS HOPING THIS WAS AN APRIL FOOL RATHER THAN THE REAL HER TANK AND MANUFACTURING DATA THE SCENT MARKETS IN A BIT OF A TAILSPIN UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS THIS IS NOT A SINGLE DATA POINT FROM JAPANESE MACRO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE'VE HAD A RAFT OF BAD INFORMATION THIS WEEK BUT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE YEN IN THE KEY PART OF ABBA NON MIX THAT HE'S BEEN WORKING
SINCE ITS INCEPTION WAS THE AND IN THE END THAT HAS GONE INTO REVERSE IT TO STRENGTHEN STARTING TO IMPACT JAPANESE MANUFACTURING AND WE WERE EXPECTING TO MOVE INTO A TECHNICAL RECESSION THIS QUARTER SIGNED FRENCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM TODAY A NEW NATIONAL A LIVING WAGE COMES INTO EFFECT IT SET AT SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY FOR WORKERS OVER TWENTY FIVE SO JUST WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF THIS WITH A RESOLUTION FOUNDATION IS CREDITED
IN POTS FOR INSPIRING THE IDEAL WORKING WITH SIR GEORGE BEIN THE FOUNDING CHAIR OF THE LOW PAY COMMISSION BUT THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS SAYS IT WILL HARM EMPLOYERS AND LOW PAID EMPLOYEES LAURA GARDENER IS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO SICK SHE IS SENIOR UPON A POLICY ANALYST AT THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION ROUND BORN HIS HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS WELCOME TO YOU BOTH SO WHAT WAS THE ROLE THAT LAURA OF THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION HERE
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO WE CONDUCTED AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND WHAT THAT REVIEW DAISY THAT CELEBRATE THE SUCCESS OF THIS POLITY IN ERADICATING EXPLOITATIVE PAY AND RAISING PAY FOR LOW PAID WORKERS WITHOUT COSTING THE JOBS IT WAS PREDICTED TO COST HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT
WELL IT'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAT A WIDE BODY OF RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW IF ANY EMPLOYMENT AND IMPACT FROM THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY SO GIVEN ITS SUCCESS AS A POLICY UNDER THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE LOW PAY COMMISSION WE WANTED TO SEE A BIT MORE AMBITION PUSHING FURTHER SEEING WHETHER WE COULD MAKE THE MINIMUM WAGE MORE ROBUST TOOL FOR TACKLING LOW PAY IN THIS COUNTRY
THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS DEBATE AND THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY KIND OF INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE IS INTRODUCED OR THE MINIMA WEDGE ITSELF IN GERMANY WERE SAYING IN PARTS OF THE U.S. AS WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS GOING TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT OF HELPING PEOPLE ON TO REDUCING THE WAGE GAP BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT DESTROYED JOBS WHILE THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T KNOW AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BEST EVIDENCE FROM AROUND THE WORLD ON THE BEST EVIDENCE FROM THEIR ROUND THE WORLD SEEMS TO SUGGEST
ACTUALLY IF YOU SET A MINIMUM WAGES CONSERVATIVELY THEY HAD A SMALL BUT NEGATIVE AFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE WAS QUITE A RADICAL EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY THIS IS A TEN POINT SIX PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR THAT'S NOT INCREASE IT IS IT IS ONLY THE OVER TWENTY FIVES YEAH BUT IT'S A TEN POINT SIX PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR INCREASE AND THEN MOVING TOWARDS A SITUATION WHERE RATHER THAN THE LOW PAY COMMISSION SET IN THIS INDEPENDENTLY OF GOVERNMENT OR RECOMMENDED IT INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE QUITE MECHANISTIC LINK WITH SIXTY PER CENT OF MEDIAN EARNINGS AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY RETAIL CATERING CLEANING SOCIAL CARE
QUITE A LOT OF THESE INDUSTRIES OPERATE ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS AND ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THROUGH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE REPORTS FROM COMPANIES AND THINGS THAT COMPANIES ARE HAVING TO ADJUST BY PERHAPS REDUCING OTHER IN WORK BENEFITS REDUCING OURS OR FINDING WAYS OF ALTERNATING JOBS THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY BY HUMANS LAURA IT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO AFFECT THE WAY EMPLOYERS THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF THEIR WORKERS ISN'T IT
IT IS AND WHAT'S REALLY ING AND WE I WE SHOULD STRESS THAT THIS NEW HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE IS MOVING INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY OR PUSHES THE U.K. TOWARDS THE TOP OF INTERNATIONAL STANDINGS IN TERMS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE SO MANAGING ITS IMPLEMENTATION SENSIBLY IT'S GOING TO BE CRUCIAL SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES WHAT'S ENCOURAGING IS THAT WHEN WE SURVEYED EMPLOYERS
THEIR MAIN RESPONSE THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE IS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY IN ORDER TO AFFORD THESE WAGE INCREASES RATHER THAN RAISING PRICES OR CUT IN WORKING HOURS THAT'S NOT EASY SO WE NEED A REALLY CRUCIAL ROLE PAID BY PLAYED BY GOVERNMENT OR BY NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE LOW PAY COMMISSION TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES IN THE KEY SECTORS RYAN MENTIONED
TO FIND WAYS TO GET THOSE PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES VIPER RYAN PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY WILL BE IMPROVEMENTS OF PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN A STICKING POINT FOR REALLY SOME TIME THAT'S ALL IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY IS NOT COST US OF COURSE AND THERE'S ONE WAY OF IMPROVING AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY WHICH IS TO ELIMINATE MANY LOW SKILLED PEOPLE FROM HAVING JOBS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S THE FRENCH MODEL OF OF IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY BELOW I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT THIS FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE WE MOVED AWAY FROM A SITUATION WHERE THE LOW PAY COMMISSION SET THIS INDEPENDENTLY OF GOVERNMENT
AND IN ESSENCE NOW THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IS DIRECTING WHERE WAGES SHOULD BE NOW THE SAFEGUARD FOR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MECHANISM WHEREBY THEM THE LIVING WAGE IS LINKED TO SIXTY PER CENT OF MEDIA BUT I CAN'T ENVISAGE A SITUATION WHEN YOU HIT A RECESSION A MEDIAN FOR WHERE THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER IS GOING TO STAND IN PARLIAMENT WELL ANNOUNCE NOMINAL WAGE CUT IT'S LIKE TWENTY WHAT DOES THAT ANYWAY STIMULATE THE ECONOMY
NO THAT'S JUST JUNK KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS I'M AFRAID BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE THERE HAS TO BE THERE'S A COST SOMEWHERE IN THE ECONOMY EITHER FROM LOWER INVESTMENT THROUGH LESS IN THE WAY OF RETAINED PROFITS OR PERHAPS HIGHER PRICES LEAVING PEOPLE WITH LESS DISPOSABLE INCOME AFTER PAYING FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND GOODS AND SERVICES
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH AND IF RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS THE WAY TO GET US INTO PROSPERITY WE SHOULD DO IT FOR AFRICA WE COULD JUST SAY LET IMPOSE MINIMUM WAGES AND YOU'LL ALL BE RICH RYAN PAUL THANK YOU FOR ACCUSING ME OF SOME JUNK KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS GIVEN I THINK TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAURA GARDEN

LAST MONTH TURKEY HAS YET TO RESPOND
A MAN IS DUE IN COURT IN KENT LATER CHARGED WITH MURDERING TWO PEOPLE IN CANTERBURY FOSTER CHRISTIAN HE'S FIFTY THREE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING SIMON GRETSKY AND NATASHA SADLER HE ALSO FACES TWO COUNTS OF GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM
MUSICIANS INCLUDING DEBBIE DEBBIE HARRY MICHAEL STIPE CYNDI LAUPER AND THE PIXIES HAVE BEEN HONOURING DAVID BOWIE AT A CONCERT IN NEW YORK THE EVENT WAS ORIGINALLY ORGANISED AS A RETROSPECTIVE BUT BECAME A MEMORIAL AFTER THE SINGER DIED IN JANUARY
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE GET A PAY RISE TODAY IS THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE COMES INTO FORCE REQUIRING THOSE EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID AT LEAST SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR ANDY VERITY ARE ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE LINE IT WAS A VERY STRIKING MOVE ANDY WHEN IT WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY IS IT A GAMBLE
YEAH I MEAN VERY STRIKING JUST THINK IT'S A LABOUR GOVERNMENT HAD ANNOUNCED THIS HOW DIFFERENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GAMBLE WELL YES AND NO THE PERILS OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAY CHAQUE HINA COURSE TO INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE PREDICT THAT IT MIGHT COST JOBS BECAUSE EMPLOYERS WILL HAVE A HIGHER WAGE BILLS THEREFORE THEY'LL LET'S HAVE LESS MONEY TO RECRUIT NEW WORKERS
BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY IS PREDICTING SIXTY THOUSAND JOBS BY TWENTY TWENTY ALTHOUGH THAT SOUNDS BAD WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE WORKFORCE OF THIRTY MILLION IS THAT C. ONE JOB IN FIVE HUNDRED UNDESIRABLE PERHAPS BUT NOT A MASSIVE IMPACT BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE QUITE A STEEP CURVE THOUGH IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS WITH WITH WITH THE THE WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO RISE UP TO NINE
YES I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE COSTUME EMPLOYERS THE LOW PAY COMMISSION HAS ESTIMATED THAT THIS YEAR IT'S ONLY GOING TO CROSSED EMPLOYS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT
ONE ONE POUND IN EVERY THOUSAND THAN EMPLOYERS FRIENDS ON THEIR WAGE BILL BUT AS YOU SAY IT'S YOU AS YOU ADVANCE OF THE GOES UP ABOUT NINE
IT'S GOING TO COST MORE LIKE THREE BILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY AND OF COURSE THAT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED THIS EFFECT BECAUSE THOSE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WORKERS YOU PAY LESS THAN SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AT THE MOMENT THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE IN PARTICULARLY PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES LOW PAID INDUSTRIES LIKE HOSPITALITY RESTAURANTS THE CATERING TRADE
HOTELS IT'S ACTRESS THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE VERY FINE PROFIT MARGINS THEY'LL BE THE ONES WHO STRUGGLE AND THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT EXPANDING AND TAKING NEW PEOPLE ALTHOUGH OZ THERE WEIGHT ALTHOUGH IF IT MAKES THEIR EXISTING EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE THEN THERE'S A DIFFIDENT
YES I MEAN ONE INTERESTING THING HERE IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGH WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY BUT THE FAT WE'VE HAD SUCH A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF LABOUR IN THIS COUNTRY ISN'T MEANT THAT THE BUSINESS IS WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND
IT'S REALLY EASIER AND CHEAPER FOR THEM TO JUST TAKE SOMEONE NEW ON BECAUSE THEY CAN TAKE THEM ON QUITE CHEAPLY RATHER THAN FOR EXAMPLE MAKING A BIG INVESTMENT IN THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE EACH WORK UP MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE NOW THE INCENTIVES WILL CHANGE SLIGHTLY SO IN TWO OR THREE YEARS' TIME THE BALANCE OF THAT DECISION FOR EACH EMPLOYERS GOING TO BE MORE IN FAVOUR OF INVESTMENT AND THAT COULD WELL HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON PRODUCTIVITY ANDY VERITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN THE BUSINESS SECRETARY WILL GO TO PATO BUT TODAY HE'S BACK FROM HIS TRIP TO AUSTRALIA FROM WHICH HE'D EMERGED YESTERDAY AS WELL THAT HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER CHRIS MASON IS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND SUCH JOB GOES THERE AND ANNOUNCES OARS OR SAYS WHAT CRESS LIKE MISTER JAVID SWAPPING NEW SOUTH WALES WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN TOW FOR SOUTH WALES WITH THE CAMERAS IN TOW AND QUITE A BIT POLITICAL HEAT NO DOUBT WERE TOLD THAT HE WILL SAY WHEN HE MEETS
THE MANAGEMENT AND UNIONS LOWE CLAIM PEAS MEMBERS OF THE WELSH ASSEMBLY THAT ALL POSSIBLE MINISTERIAL OFFICIAL AND DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE WILL BE EXERTED TO HELP SECURE THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE STEEL INDUSTRY WHICH SOUNDS GREAT DOESN'T IT BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EMPHASISING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS A NOTE OF CAUTION A LIMIT TO WHAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE
JAVED'S EMPHASISING HIMSELF AND THIS IS HER SECOND VISIT TO THE SITE AT THIS YEAR GIVEN THE HEAT HE'S HAD GIVEN WHERE HE'S BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AND INCREASING AMOUNTS OF HEAT JUST INCOMING THE GOVERNMENT'S WAY ABOUT WHAT IT HAS OR HASN'T DONE
REGARDING TARIFFS AND ALL OF THIS CHEAP STYLE CHINESE STEEL IS FLOATING AROUND IN A SUGGESTION THAT PLENTY IN EUROPE HAVE WANTED TO SEE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DO MORE AND BRITAIN HAS BEEN ARGUING AGAINST THAT MY HIMSELF TOLD PARLIAMENT
LAST MONTH AT THERE'S A THERE'S A FINE BALANCE BETWEEN IMPOSING SUCH TARIFFS AND NOT PUTTING TOO MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON STEEL CONSUMERS PURCHASERS AVOIDS OF IT AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO WERE MAKING IT DOES THE GOVERNMENT FEEL ITSELF TO BE UNDER
THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT MIGHT LEAD IT TO DO THINGS IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO DO I DON'T LIKE THAT I THINK IS VERY CONSCIOUS WITH THE SCALE OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT'S IT HE'S FORCED TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT IT MIGHT NOT NORMALLY
FIND ITSELF ASKING SO YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S IN THE LAST FEW DAYS ENTERTAIN THE IDEA BEFORE THE PRIME MINISTER RULE IT OUT OF THE MERITS OF NATIONALISATION NOT THE KIND OF THING POLITICALLY YOU WOULD NECESSARILY EXPECT CONSERVATIVE M.P.S TO ARTICULATE AND THEY'RE WRESTLING WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN THE GLOBAL MARKET FORCES THAT EXERTING THEMSELVES HERE
COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT HERE IS AN INDUSTRY THAT PLENTY IN GOVERNMENT RECOGNISED HAS A STRATEGIC VALUE AS A TEACH IT LONG TERM VALUE AND YET THERE IS THIS GAP WITH TATA
CLEARLY QUITE KEEN TO GET RID OF THESE PLANTS AS QUICKLY AS IT CAN GIVEN HOW MUCH MONEY IT'S LOSING THE POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE THAT MARKET CONDITIONS COULD IMPROVE SO THAT SUCH PLANTS WOULD BE VIABLE BUT IN THE MEANTIME A GAP OF THE LENGTH OF WHICH NO ONE CAN QUITE DEFINE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT COULD FACE A MIGHTY BIG BILL BUT THEN THE ALTERNATIVE BEING YOU KNOW A HUGE AMOUNT OF AN EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY CHRIS MASON THANKS
THE TIME'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT AROUND THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR MATERIAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE SAFE FROM THE HANDS OF EXTREMISTS THAT IS WHAT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY I ASKED OR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOAP OR HOW MUCH OF A FEAR THERE ARE NOW IS ABOUT NUCLEAR TERRORISM
I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS GREAT I THINK IT WAS THOUGHT THEORETICALLY TO BE A REAL POSSIBILITY BUT I THINK IN THE WAKE OF THE BRUSSELS ATTACKS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE INVOLVED FROM SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE HAD BEEN SCOUTING BELGIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES I THINK THAT HAS GIVEN THE WHOLE SUBJECT RENEWED URGENCY AND DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF THOSE COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAS TO BE DEALT WITH I'M NOT JUST THE KIND OF OBVIOUS STATES LIKE
BELGIUM OR BRITAIN OR FRANCE BUT COUNTRIES WHERE MAYBE THE NUCLEAR FACILITIES ARE NOT AS WELL PROTECTED SECURITY NET MEASURES ARE NOT AS ELABORATE AS THEY ARE IN SOME WESTERN COUNTRIES AND ALL THEIR PARTICULAR COUNTRIES THAT THIS SUMMIT IS GOING TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY AND WILL THEY BE THERE
YES OR NO I MEAN THE RUSSIANS AREN'T TAKING PART SO YOU'VE GOT A COUNTRY WITH A VERY LARGE NUCLEAR ARSENAL WHICH FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO DO WITH THE KIND OF HISTORY OF RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE U.S.A. I'M NOT THERE SO THEY'RE NOT PART OF IT AND COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST CONCERN OVER HOW WELL
THEN YOU CLEAR STOCKPILES ARE PROTECTED IN THEIR NUCLEAR MATERIAL IS SECURED YES PROGRESS IS BEING MADE THERE AND THE U.S. SAID LAST NIGHT THAT ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED ON SECURING NUCLEAR MATERIAL SO THAT IT DOESN'T FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE STATES WHICH ARE ENTIRELY BEYOND THE REACH OF THESE KINDS OF OUR DISCUSSIONS NORTH KOREA FOR EXAMPLE
EXACTLY YOU'VE HAD A MEETING TAKING PLACE YESTERDAY WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA MET HIS CHINESE COUNTERPART YOU ALSO HAD A SEPARATE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA AND THE JAPANESE LEADER'S TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE MUST BE NO SCALING BACK ON U.N. SANCTIONS HOW THE PRESSURE MUST BE KEPT ON NORTH KOREA
AND YOU'VE HAD THE CHINESE AND AMERICANS AGREEING THAT THEY MUST KEEP THE PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA BUT WHAT DO YOU DO YOU HAD A VERY SEVERE SANCTIONS REGIME ALREADY IN PLACE
HOW DO YOU GET SOMEONE LIKE HIM JUNK URBAN TO CHANGE HIS BEHAVIOUR THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS LIKE THAT ON THE OTHER HAD BARACK OBAMA WHO'S INVESTED A LOT POLITICALLY INTO THIS NUCLEAR SECURITY CONFERENCE IS ABLE TO POINT TO IRAN AS THEY LOOK THEY'RE WE DID MANAGE TO GET A DEAL AND A FEW YEARS AGO PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE DOGS OPAL IN WASHINGTON THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NINETY MINUTES SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THE MAIN STORE IN THE TIME SAYS TATA STEEL HAS ACCUSE DAVID CAMERON OF SLEEP WALKING INTO THE CURRENT CRISIS BY HELPING CHINA BLOCK EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO INCREASE TARIFFS ON CHEAP STEEL IMPORTS ACCORDING TO THE PAPER SENIOR TATA OFFICIAL SAID TO BE AMAZED AT THE PRIME MINISTER'S FAILURE TO HEED THEIR WARNINGS THAT CHINA WOULD DUMP CHEAP STEEL ON THE MARKET UNDERCUTTING BRITAIN STORIES ALSO THE LABEL OF FINANCIAL TIMES WHICH QUOTES FRENCH AND ITALIAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING THAT BRITAIN LEAD OPPOSITION
TO AN OVERHAUL OF ANTI DUMPING RULES BUT THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT IS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT THE U.K. HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PRESSING THE E.U. TO ACT AGAINST UNFAIR DUMPING THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE USES AN ARTICLE IN THE SUN TO DEFEND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE OF SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR FOR PEOPLE AGED TWENTY FIVE AND OVER HE SAYS MILLIONS WILL BE EARNING MORE AND THAT COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN HELPED WITH CUTS AND TAX AND NATIONAL INSURANCE
BUT THE DAILY MAIL SAYS NURSERY OWNERS HAVE JOINED RETAILERS SMALL FIRMS AND CARE HOMES IN WARNING THAT THE LIVING AGE WAGE WILL MEAN LESS RECRUITMENT IMPOSSIBLE JOB LOSSES THE GUARDIAN SAYS CASH IN HAND WORKERS LIKE CLEANERS AND GARDENERS FACE MISSING OUT ON THE RISE THE EYE NEWSPAPER USES THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE FAT PLANETS TO SUM UP THE LATEST WARNING ABOUT RISING IN PEACE IT IT HAPPENS
THE TELEGRAPH SAYS COUNTRIES LIKE THE U.K. WILL FACE AN EPIDEMIC OF SEVERE ARE BASICALLY IN COMING YEARS THE PAPER PREDICTS THAT STATINS CAN BECOME USELESS FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN BECAUSE PATIENCE WILL BE TOO OVERWEIGHT FOR THE CHOLESTEROL BUSTING DRUGS HAVE ANY AFFECT THE DAILY MAIL SAYS MOBILE PHONE STORES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF PUTTING PRESSURE ON CUSTOMERS TO TAKE CONTRACTS COSTING TWICE AS MUCH AS THE BEST ONE FOR THEIR NEEDS THE PAPER QUOTES CITIZENS ADVICE IS SAYING THE WAY MONTHLY CONTRACTS ARE SOLD BUNDLING THE COST OF THE HANDSET INTO THE TARIFF FOR SERVICES
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR CUSTOMERS TO COMPARE PRICES AND FIND THE BEST VALUE THERE ARE PAGES OF TRIBUTES TO RONNIE CORBETT'S WHO DIED OF COURSE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FIVE THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT'S THOUGHT HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO BE KNIGHTED IN THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY HONOURS AFTER A CAMPAIGN BY HIS FELLOW COMEDIAN DAVID WALLIAMS IT'S UNJUST THE PAPER SAYS
TALK OF THE TITLE DIDN'T COME MUCH EARLIER IN A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER THE MIRROR PRINT PULL OUT SUPPLEMENT IN TRIBUTE TO THE MAN HE CALLS A GIANT OF COMEDY THE GUARDIAN SAYS RONNIE CORBETT'S KINDNESS MODESTY AND HUMOUR MEANT HE WAS AS WELL LIGHT OFF SCREEN AS ON AND IT'S APRIL FOOL'S DAY SO THERE'S THE USUAL CROP OF STORIES DESIGNED TO TEASE READERS SUBO OBVIOUS THAN OTHERS
THE TELEGRAPH RECKONS HER VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. COULD MEAN ENGLAND'S FOOTBALLERS BEING SUSPENDED FROM THE EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN CHAMPIONSHIPS THE MALE REPORTS THAT OLIVIA COLMAN IS TO BE THE NEW JAMES BOND AND THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER ARE BEING FRESHENED UP WITH A COAT OF GLOSS PAINT IS SIXTY MINUTES TO SEVEN THE MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING LOW PAID WORKERS AGED TWENTY FIVE AND OVER OR GETTING A PAY RISE WITH THE INTRODUCTION TODAY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAY
I THINK OF DAVID BOWIE LOUNGING IN A CREAM AND BLUE SATIN DRESS ON THE COVER OF THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD THINK OF SIXTIES MODS WITH THEIR BUTTON DOWN SHIRTS MANY OF THE TAILORS BEHIND THOSE DESIGNS WERE JEWISH AND A NEW EXHIBITION AT THE JEWISH MUSEUM IN LONDON IS LOOKING AT THE CAREERS OF MEN LIKE MOSES MOSS AND BEN SHERMAN AND THE WAY THEY INFLUENCED FASHION AND POPULAR CULTURE RUSSELL REPORTS
A DEFINITION SHERMAN THEN SHERMAN'S WHY WENT THEN STARTED IN SIXTY TWO THE MAN IN THE STREET WORE A WHITE SHIRT
MAYBE A BLUE SHIRT AND THEN BROUGHT COLOUR
MY NAME IS ELIZABETH THEY'LL BE AND I AM THE CURATOR OF SOCIAL HISTORY AT THE JEWISH MUSEUM IN LONDON A LOT OF THE EARLY AS WELL ACTUALLY
THESE PARTICULAR CONNECTIONS WITH THE TAIL IN TRADE WHICH MEANT THAT THEY COULD GO TO THAT UNCLES AND THEIR FATHERS THEY COULD GET THEIR PARTICULAR DETAILING ON THE SEATS
CARNABY STREET WAS INCREDIBLE IN THOSE VERY EARLY DAYS
THE FASHION ON THE STREET STUFF MAINLY WITH THE TEDDY BOYS AND THE GIRLS ARE WEARING WHITE PLASTIC
RAINCOATS AND WHITE PLASTIC BOOTS AND IT WAS LIKE A HALCYON DAYS
DANCE
IN THE SIXTIES MILITARY VINTAGE CLOTHING SUNNY BECAME REALLY REALLY POPULAR AND IT WAS PARTICULARLY SHOCKED ON CARNABY STREET WAS SELLING SECOND HAND VINTAGE UNIFORMS AND OCCASIONALLY THERE OUR FRONT ORIGINALLY FOR MUST CROSS WHICH HAD THIS BIG MILITARY DEPARTMENT SO YOU GET CELEBRITIES LIKE JIMMY
MICK JAGGER GOING INTO PARTICULARLY ONE SHOT I WAS LORD KITCHENER'S VALET BUYING THESE CLOTHES WEARING THEM ON RECORD COVERS BEFORE MEETING THEM AND SUDDENLY IT BECOMES ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE SOMEWHERE
I'M DAVID MOSS
YES IT WAS GOING GREAT GREAT GRANDSON OF THE FOUNDER IT WAS CROSSED WE'RE NOT SURE THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE NAME CHANGE I LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WAS THE
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD A SORT OF MARKETING GIFT AND HE REALISED THAT MOSES BRUISES WOULDN'T SELL AS WELL AS MOSS BROSS FOR THAT PROBABLY
WHAT WAS HIS EXCUSE FOR CHANGE IT BUT I SUSPECT ACTUALLY THERE WAS A FEELING THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ACCEPTABLE PLEA LESS CONNECTED TO THE FAITH FOR ME
ORTHODOX JEWS THERE WAS A RELIGIOUS REQUIREMENT NOT TO MIX CERTAIN FIBRES SO DEUCED TENDED TO EMPLOY YOU JEWISH TAILORS TO KIND OF MAKE CLOSE FOR THEM AND SLOWLY HOLDING BECAME EMBEDDED WITHIN JEWISH CULTURE
A REALLY FLAMBOYANT ECCENTRIC DESIGNER CALLED MISTER FISH MICHAEL FISH WAS HIS NAME AND ONE THING THAT HE PARTICULARLY IT WAS MAKE THINGS INTERESTING MEANING
MICK JAGGER WORE ONE OF THESE WHITE MINI DRESSES ON STAGE AT THAT REALLY FAMOUS HYDE PARK CONCERT IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE
DAVID BOWIE OR ANOTHER OF HIS DRESSES I HAVE HIS ALBUM
SO SUDDENLY YOU'VE GOT MEN REALLY BEING VERY ADVENTUROUS IN WHAT THEY'RE WEARING THAT REALLY PUSHING THE LIMITS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM
A STRONG ARMY OF MODS TODAY AND THEY ONLY WORK
SIXTY IS VINTAGE MODE CLOTHES IN FACT I'VE GOT A LARGE MOD FOLLOWING ON FACE
TAFFY SHELL AN ENDING THAT REPORT ROSS HAWKINS AND THAT EXHIBITION RUNS BY THE WAY UNTIL THE NINETEENTH OF JUNE TIME NOW HE'S TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN SHOULD THE COST OF PRODUCING GREAT MUSIC BE HEARING DAMAGE TO THE MUSICIAN A LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN REPORTS NOW ON AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A GLITTERING MUSICAL CAREER THAT'S ENDED IN LITIGATION
HEARING DAMAGE SUFFERED BY ROCK MUSICIANS IS WELL DOCUMENTED FOR PSALM IT'S ALMOST A BADGE OF PRIDE
PETE TOWNSEND OF THE WHO WENT PUBLIC ABOUT HIS DECADES AGO THE DOCTOR ACTUALLY SAID
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING DEAF BUT I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO LEARN TO LIP READ
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MORE SEDATE AND SOPHISTICATED WORLD OF CLASSICAL MUSIC WELL I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN O.K. YOU COULD DO WITH A TUNE UP
THE SON OF A COMPOSER CHRIS GOLDSCHNEIDER PLAYED THE VIOLA WITH THE ROYAL LIVERPOOL PHILHARMONIC AND B.B.C. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS BEFORE JOINING THE PRESTIGIOUS ONE AT THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE
BUT IN TWENTY TWELVE HIS BLOSSOMING CAREER CAME TO AN ABRUPT END
IN COURT DOCUMENTS SEEM BY THE B. B. C. CHRIS CALLED CHINA CLAIMS HIS HEARING WAS IRREVERSIBLY DAMAGED DURING REHEARSALS OF RICHARD WAGNER'S THUNDEROUS AND T. VALDA CURE HER FROM BRASS INSTRUMENTS PLACED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HIM
THIS PIT AT THE ROYAL OPERA
THE SOUND PEAKED AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DECIBELS WHICH IS ROUGHLY THE NOISE OF A JET ENGINE
HAS BEEN DEVASTATING
ORDINARY SOUNDS LIKE BANGING CUPS AND GLASSES TOGETHER THAT'S A VERY
UNPLEASANT PAINFUL NOISE MY BABY DAUGHTERS OR AS A VERY POWERFUL VOICE AND ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO I'VE GOT NOISE AND USE VERTIGO FROM HER CRYING AND I SPENT THREE WEEKS IN BED
CHRIS CAN'T EVEN BEAR TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HIS EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SON BEN ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S OUTSTANDING YOUNG FRENCH HORN PLAYERS PRACTISING AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE DOESN'T ACCEPT THAT THE REHEARSAL NOISE CAUSE CHRIS GOULD CHARGERS INJURY AND DENIES THAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE IN A STATEMENT IT SAID MY COMPENSATION CLAIM AGAINST THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE IS A COMPLEX MEDICO LEGAL ISSUE WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME AND IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION
ALL SIDES ARE KEEN TO REACH A RESOLUTION IT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE TO COMMENT ANY FURTHER AT THIS STAGE ACCORDING TO CHRIS GOLDSCHNEIDER SOLICITOR CHRIS FRY PART OF THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE'S DEFENCE BREAKS NEW LEGAL GROUND IT'S CENTRALLY WHAT'S BEING SAID IS THAT THE BEAUTIFUL ARTISTIC
OUTPUT IS ACTUALLY JUSTIFIES DAMAGING THE HEARING OF THE MUSICIANS PERFORMING IT WE DON'T THINK THE COURT IS LIKELY TO UPHOLD THAT PARTICULAR WAY IT'S PLAIN THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STEPS COULD BE TAKEN TO STILL MAINTAIN THE BEAUTIFUL SOUND THAT IS PRODUCED AND PROTECT HEARING AT THE SAME TIME
MAURICE STEM ORCHESTRAS OFFICIAL AT THE MUSICIANS' UNION SAYS HEARING DAMAGE TO PLAYERS IS A GROWING PROBLEM HAVE AFTER WORK HARDER THESE DAYS AND THEY DID
UNDERFUNDING IN THEIR SECTOR MEANS THEY HAVE TO GIVE MORE CONCERTS THAT MEANS MORE EXPOSURE TO NOISE ALSO CONDUCTORS ARE ALLOWED TO RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER HEALTH AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS ISN'T IT A BIT OF A HANGOVER OF A SORT OF DIVA CULTURE WHERE THE CONDUCTOR IS EFFECTIVELY IS GOD THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM
THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE ORCHESTRA HAS SOME ONE HUNDRED PLAYERS AND THE B. B. C. HAS LEARNT THAT OVER A QUARTER REPORT OCCASIONAL OR MILD HEARING ILLNESS AND THAT IN THE YEAR BEFORE LAST THERE WERE SEVEN CASES OF SICKNESS ABSENCE RELATED TO NOISE PROBLEMS AND A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN WEEKS OF SICK LEAVE TAKEN THAT'S NOT MUSIC TO ANYONE'S EARS YOU DON'T MIND LOOKING
IT'S VERY STRANGE FOR SOMEONE WHO SPENT NINE HOURS PLAYING IT DAY IT'S ALMOST BEEN LIKE FOR A FOOTBALL OR NOT TO BE ABLE TO KICK A FOOTBALL
THAT REPORT FROM A LEGAL CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COLEMAN THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN WE THE NATION ARE UNDER SLEEPING BY AN AVERAGE OF AN HOUR A NIGHT AND IT IS BAD FOR US RAISING THE RISK OF CONDITIONS INCLUDING DEPRESSION AND CANCER
THAT IS THE VIEW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE SHIRLEY KRAMER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE IDEA OF UNDER SLEEPING IS AN INTERESTING ONE DOESN'T THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP WE NEED VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND VERY DEPENDING ON YOUR AGE IT DOES INDEED WE KNOW THAT BABIES OF COURSE NEED A LOT MORE SLEEP THAN SOMEBODY OVER SIXTY FIVE HOWEVER WITHIN THE RANGE OF AVERAGE SLEEPING SOFA AN ADULT THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN SEVEN AND NINE HOURS WE ARE STILL UNDER SLEEPING
BY A FACTOR QUITE A LARGE FACTOR SAY AVERAGE ADULT SLEEPS THERE SIX POINT EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT WE'RE NOT THAT FAR OFF THE MINIMUM YOU'RE SUGGESTING NOT TOO FAR OFF SO IT'S QUITE GOOD TO HEAR THAT THE PUBLIC SLEEPS SIX POINT EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS THEY ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO SLEEP SEVEN POINT SEVEN HOURS A NIGHT THEY TOLD US
AND THE OTHER THING THEY SAID WAS THAT SLEEP FOR THEM IS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE AFTER NOT SMOKING WHICH I THINK WILL SURPRISE MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE WE WOULD ALWAYS THINK ABOUT DIET PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OTHER AREAS OF OUR HEALTH BUT I THINK
PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP I A REPORT IS TO SHOW THE EXTENT OF THAT RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT JUST REFLECTING THAT MOST OF US WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO HAVE MORE SLEEP YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE THINK SLEEP SHOULD BE ON A PARITY WITH OTHER HEALTH ISSUES SO WE OUGHT TO THINK
AS A NATION A BIT MORE ABOUT OUR SLEEP AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION OUT THERE'S MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP YOU'RE MORE AT RISK FOR AND RAFT ACTUALLY HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING CANCER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE WHY WHY DOES IT INCREASE YOUR RISK OF CANCER SO THE RISKS ARE RELATED TO HORMONES WE DONE THIS REPORT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND LOOKED AT ALL THE LATEST RESEARCH OF PROFESSOR COLIN ESPIE ON THIS AND
THE INDICATORS OF RISK A SIMILAR WITH OTHER AREAS OF DEPRIVATION OF THE ROWS OF RISK THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE GUIDELINES ON DRINKING SMOKING ET-CETERA AND SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS A HIGH RISK SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT SOMETHING
THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT LEASE AND SO YOU'D LIKE DOCTORS YOU GO AND SEE THE DOCTOR AND THEY TELL YOU STOP SMOKING TAKE MORE EXERCISE YOU'D LIKE THEM TO ALSO SAY YOU SHOULD BE SLEEPING FOR UP TO NINE HOURS A NIGHT OVER OR PERHAPS TO JUST ASK THEM ABOUT THE SLEEPING PATTERNS I THINK WE'RE GETTING MUCH BETTER ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WERE ASKING ABOUT PEEP HOW PEOPLE FEEL IF THEY HAVE LOW MOOD TO ASK ABOUT THEIR SLEEP PATTERNS WOULD FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY SO TO BE AWARE THAT ACTUALLY THAT SOMETIMES SLEEP DEPRIVATION IS A REASON
ON ITS OWN TO CAUSE ISSUES FOR PEOPLE BUT THE TROUBLE IS IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF IT AND TO GET THERE AT THE GET THE RIGHT ADVICE BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING SHIFTS HAVE LONG COMMUTES HAVE CHILDCARE COMMITMENTS IT JUST HOWEVER MUCH THEY'D LIKE TO SLEEP MORE IT JUST MAY NOT BE PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM I'VE DAILY LIKE THAT IF WE ARE AWARE OF IT AT LEAST WE CAN DO
SOMETHING MORE ABOUT IT AND TRY AND PERHAPS GET TO BED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE TWO MODES OF TREATMENT ONE HIS MEDICATION OBVIOUSLY AND THE OTHER IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S VERY GOOD AND SUSTAINS
AND GIVES YOU MUCH BETTER HELP AND WE NOW HAVE DIGITAL C.B. TEA SO FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE REALLY ARE HELPFUL
YOU'RE HAVE SLEEP MEDICATION WOULD YOU BE IN FAVOUR OF THAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH THAT IF YOU IF YOU NEED A DRUG TO HELP YOU GET TO SLEEP IT'S WORTH IT WILL CERTAINLY IF YOU'VE GOT INSOMNIA DISORDER THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE THREE NIGHTS A WEEK WHERE YOU'RE NOT FALLING ASLEEP PROPERLY OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD AND YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED AND CERTAINLY YOU NEED SUPPORT WITH THAT AND IT'S POTENTIALLY UNDER DIAGNOSED SO OF COURSE MEDICATION IS A GOOD TOOL BUT THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE LESS DIFFICULT SIDE EFFECTS AND A C.B.T. AND FINALLY AND I MAY HAVE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS CAN YOU MAKE UP FOR A LACK OF SLEAZE IF YOU HAVE A NAP IN THE DAY IF YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT ENOUGH AT NIGHT IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH ASKING FOR A FRIEND I DID HESITATE TO TALK TO BOTH OF YOU ABOUT ABOUT THIS SHIFT WORK AT THE WORDS MY HOLIDAY WORK O.K.
CERTAINLY WELL IT WILL HELP HER BUT IT'S WITH SHIFT PATTERNS IT IS ACTUALLY THE DISRUPTION OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF YOUR CIRCADIAN PATTERNS I THINK NOTHING WILL HELP AND YOU BOTH LOOK REALLY HEALTHY
THANKS AT LEAST FOR NOW SHIRLEY KRAMER THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVAN USED TO LISTEN TO DOLPHINS I'M NOT I THOUGHT IT WENT IN THE ROOM I WAS WALES SOMETHING LIKE THAT ANYWAY MIND YOU HE'S NOT HERE NOW SO THERE WE ARE I DON'T LIKE THAT TELLS US THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND THREE BITS TO IT THROUGH MISTER SEVEN AND STABBED HER NEST

RESEARCHERS SAY THERE ARE MORE ADULTS AROUND THE WORLD CLASSED AS OBESE THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERWEIGHT THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY DIANA SPEED MORE THAN A MILLION LOW PAID WORKERS ACROSS THE U.K. ON RECEIVING A PAY RISE TODAY WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE EMPLOYERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY STAFF AGED TWENTY FIVE AND OVER AT LEAST SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR
THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS DESCRIBED THE MEASURE AS PERHAPS THE ONE I'M MOST PROUD OF THE T.U.C. EQUALLED THE PAY INCREASE GOOD NEWS FOR ELIGIBLE WORKERS' COUNCILS THOUGH HAVE WARNED OF ITS IMPACT ON THEIR SOCIAL CARE BUDGETS AND THERE ARE FEARS THAT SOME COMPANIES WERE CUT JOBS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO PAY THE HIGHER RATE LABOUR SAYS THE GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING IN THE WAGE WITH ONE HAND WHILE TAKING FIVE TIMES AS MUCH IN BENEFIT CUTS WITH THE OTHER HE'S OUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT ANDY VERITY
A TEN PERCENT PAY RISE IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE RISE MOST WORKERS ARE GETTING BUT THAT'S THE YEAR ON YEAR PAY RISE YOU'LL HAVE RECEIVED TODAY IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE OR OVER AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THE MINIMUM WAGE THOSE JUST ABOVE THAT WAGE LEVELS SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT AS THEY'RE PAID TO HE'S STEPPED UP
ACCORDING TO THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF IT ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND PART TIME WORKERS
THIS YEAR AT LEAST THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE COMES AT A SURPRISINGLY MODEST COST ACCORDING TO THE LOW PAY COMMISSION EMPLOYERS WILL PAY AN EXTRA SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN WAGES OR NOUGHT POINT ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WAGE BILL
WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WERE DIRE PREDICTIONS THAT EVEN AT THREE POUNDS AN HOUR IT WILL COST A MILLION JOBS PREDICTIONS THAT PROVED GROUNDLESS NOW THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY PREDICTS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THERE WILL BE SIXTY THOUSAND FEWER JOBS THAN THEY'D OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS
RYAN BORN FROM THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS OR FREE MARKET THINK TANK TOLD US THE WAGE WAS A RADICAL EXPERIMENT FOR EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS ARE LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY RETAIL CATERING CLEANING SOCIAL CARE QUITE A LOT OF THESE INDUSTRIES OPERATE ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS AND ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THROUGH SOME OF THE
I THOUGHT SOME OF THE REPORTS FROM COMPANIES AND THINGS THAT COMPANIES ARE HAVING TO ADJUST BY PERHAPS REDUCING OTHER IN WORK BENEFITS REDUCING OURS OR FINDING WAYS OF AUTOMATING JOBS THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY BY HUMANS
THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGI JAVID WILL VISIT THE THREATENED PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS TODAY AFTER CUTTING SHORT AN OFFICIAL TRIP TO AUSTRALIA HE'S EXPECTED TO TELL WORKERS AT THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE ALL OFFICIAL AND DIPLOMATIC LEVERS TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF TATA STEEL'S U.K. OPERATIONS EARLIER THIS WEEK THE INDIAN OWNED GROUP ANNOUNCED IT WANTED TO SELL OFF THE HEAVILY LOSS MAKING BUSINESS WHICH EMPLOYS NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM WESTMINSTER OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
BADGER JAVID HAS FACE CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION FROM LABOUR M. PEASE WHO SAID HIS ABSENCE IN RECENT DAYS AND HIS DECISION TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO A STRAY LEAH ALBEIT AT HIS OWN EXPENSE PROVED HIS INDIFFERENCE TO THE PLIGHT OF STEEL WORKERS
AFTER CUTTING HIS TRADE TRIP SHORT MY JAVID WILL TODAY MEET STAFF AND MANAGEMENT AT THE THREATENED PORT TALBOT PLANT TO TELL THAN THE GOVERNMENT IS ON THEIR SIDE HE'LL SAY HE'LL WORK WITH FELLOW MINISTERS AND THE WELSH GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO SECURE A BUYER FOR TATA'S ASSETS ECHOING THE PRIME MINISTER WHO YESTERDAY SAID NATIONALISATION WASN'T THE ANSWER AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ENCOURAGE POTENTIAL PURCHASERS
MISTER JAVID SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS WORKING HARD TO ACHIEVE A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT WE'RE FALLING STEEL PRICES AND OVER CAPACITY ACKNOWLEDGED IT COULDN'T CHANGE THE STATUS OF THE GLOBAL STEEL MARKET
A GLOBAL STUDY SAYS ADULTS CLASSIFIED AS BEING OBESE NOW OUTNUMBER THOSE WHO ARE UNDERWEIGHT THE RESEARCH WAS LED BY A TEAM AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON IT EXAMINE CHANGES IN BODY MASS INDEX WHICH IS CALCULATED BY HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AMONG ALMOST TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE OVER FORTY YEARS
THE CLINICAL DEFINITION OF A BEAST IS A B.M.I. OF THIRTY KILOGRAMS PER METRE SQUARED THE STUDY WARNS THAT IF THE CURRENT TREND CONTINUES ONE FIFTH OF THE WORLD WILL BE IN THAT CATEGORY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO SAYS EXCESSIVELY LOW BODYWEIGHT REMAINS A SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE IN THE WORLD'S POOREST REGIONS IS OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
THESE SCIENTISTS WRITING IN THE LANCET SAY THAT FOUR DECADES AGO BEING UNDERWEIGHT WAS A FAR MORE COMMON PROBLEM THAN A BE CITY BUT NOW THE WORLD HAS CHANGED WITH MORE ADULTS ARE BEAST THAN UNDERWEIGHT
THE RESEARCH WHICH POOL DATA ON HEIGHT AND WEIGHT FROM ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHTY SIX COUNTRIES FOUND OBESITY AMONG MEN HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND MORE THAN DOUBLED IN WOMEN MORE ABUSE MEN AND WOMEN NOW LIVE IN CHINA AND THE U.S. THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND WOMEN IN THE U.K. HAVE THE THIRD HIGHEST BODY MASS INDEX IN EUROPE
HOWEVER BEING UNDERWEIGHT REMAINED A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH PROBLEM IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA AND BANGLADESH THE AUTHOR'S SAID SEVERE OBESITY WAS TOO SIGNIFICANT TO BE TACKLED WITH MEDICATION OR BIKE LANES THEY CALLED ON GOVERNMENTS TO COORDINATE ACTION ESPECIALLY ON FOOD PRICING
GREATER MANCHESTER BECOMES THE FIRST PART OF ENGLAND TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RUNNING HIS OWN HEALTH SERVICES TODAY THIRTY EIGHT ORGANISATIONS ARE JOINING FORCES WILL BE LOOKING AFTER TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE A SIMILAR APPROACH TO INTEGRATING HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE IS BEING TAKEN IN SCOTLAND AND WALES WHILE NORTHERN IRELAND HAS ALREADY SUCH A SYSTEM HERE'S A NORTH WEST ENGLAND POLITICAL EDITOR A REEF AND SURREY
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR GREATER MANCHESTER'S COUNCIL LEADERS AND N.H.S. MANAGERS HAVE BEEN PLANNING FOR A FUNDAMENTAL SHAKE UP OF THE HEALTH SERVICE IT'S THE FIRST TIME CONTROL OF THE N.H.S. HAS BEEN DEVOLVED LIKE THIS IN ENGLAND A NEW BODY CONSISTING OF TEN LOCAL COUNCILS FIFTEEN N.H.S. TRUSTS A DOZEN CLINICAL COMMISSIONING GROUPS AND N.H.S. ENGLAND WILL CONTROL A SIX BILLION POUND BUDGET
THE AIM IS TO BETTER INTEGRATE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE AND PRIORITISE PREVENTION RATHER THAN CURE BUT THERE ARE RISKS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IN FOUR YEARS' TIME THE REGIONAL N.H.S.

THANK YOU IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN TWO BIG CHANGES WILL AFFECT THE FINANCES OF MINUTES OF PEOPLE TODAY THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE A BEGINS EVERYONE OVER TWENTY FIVE MUST BE PAID SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR THAT RISE TO NINE BY TWENTY TWENTY
ALSO THE EXTRA STAMP DUTY RULES COME INTO PLAY FOR BUY TO LET LANDLORDS OR INDEED ANYONE WHO HAS A SECOND HOME AN EXTRA THREE PERCENT HAS TO BE PAID WHEN YOU BUY SIR PANELS ITS FOUNDER OF SAVVY WOMAN DOT CODE OF U.K. AND PERSONAL FINANCE EXPERT ANNIE'S HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING ON AN ACTUAL LIVING WAGE FIRST OF ALL WHERE REPORTING THIS MORNING MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE GETTING A PAY RISE THAT IS TRUE ISN'T IT THEY ARE GETTING A PAY RISE BUT THE FEAR WILL BE LOTS OF COMPANIES WILL CLAW IT BACK ANOTHER WAY
I THINK WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN A LOT OF THAT SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY AN OUNCE LAST JULY AND MORE SO IN THE LAST WEEKS AND I THINK I MEAN THE THREE SECTORS THAT SEEM TO PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE THINGS LIKE AGRICULTURE HOSPITALITY AND SERVICES AND THE CARING SECTOR WAS ONES OF THE RETAIL I THINK IN PARTICULAR IT WILL BE AREAS LIKE CARING THAT MAY STRUGGLE WHERE THE AMOUNT THEY CAN CHARGE IS LIMITED PARTICULARLY IF THEY'RE SELLING THEIR SERVICES TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE THAT MAYBE THE RETAIL AND HOSPITALITY SECTOR
DOES THEY COULD POSSIBLY PASS SOME OF THOSE RISES ON IN IN INCREASED PRICES TO US CONSUMERS AND WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN SOME COMPANY SAYING THAT THEY MAY CUT OVERTIME OR CUT OTHER BENEFITS YEAH IN THE TIMES TODAY THE OWNER OF B. AND Q. THE TIMES SAYS HE'S THREATENING TO SACK STAFF UNLESS LESSER SIGN A NEW EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT WHICH COULD COST QUITE A FEW OF THOSE EMPLOYEES QUITE A LOT OF OF MONEY SO FOR INSTANCE THEY'RE NOT GETTING DOUBLE TIME PREMIUM ON
SUNDAYS AND BANK HOLIDAYS YOU JUST WONDER THE EXTENT TO WHICH I'D BE VERY INTERESTING ACTUALLY HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS POSITION IF YOU WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH US THE EXTENT TO WHICH ACTUALLY COMPANIES ARE DECIDING THEY CAN'T PASS THIS ON TO CONSUMERS TO PEOPLE WHO BUY THE STUFF THAT THAT ACTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THEIR MONEY BACK FROM FROM THEN PLANKS AND WE WON'T KNOW THIS TO SOME MONTHS BECAUSE WHEN THE WHEN THE ACTUAL MINIMUM WAGE CAME IN A FEW YEARS AGO WE DID SEE AGAIN A LOT OF
COMPANY SAYING THIS WOULD FORCE THEM TO CUT A LOT OF JOBS IN THERE SOME QUITE DIRE PREDICTIONS FOR THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT WILL BE LOST BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE IT NOW OBVIOUSLY COAT COINCIDED WITH BETTER ECONOMIC TIMES AND WE WAIT MAYBE EXPERIENCING NOW ALTHOUGH THINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY GETTING BETTER WIN A RECOVERY THERE ARE STILL STILL TOUGH TIMES A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL SHOPPING AROUND ON THE BASIS OF PRICE SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOME RETAILERS MAY FEEL LIKE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
PASS THOSE INCREASED COSTS AND OF COURSE THIS ISN'T JUST A PAY RISE WE'RE ALWAYS COMPARING IT TO THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT YOU KNOW IT IS A PAY RISE FOR ANYBODY WHO'S PAID LESS THAN SEVEN TWENTY NOW WHO'S OVER TWENTY FIVE AND THEY HAVE BEEN A LOT OF EMPLOYERS RECENTLY THAT SAY WE PAY MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT MAYBE SIX EIGHTY SIX NINETEEN NOW
NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY SEVEN TWENTY SO THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BE CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND GOOD FOR THEM OBVIOUSLY BUT NOT THEN IF THE EMPLOYER START TO TAKE ACTION TO CLAW BACK THIS AND GOOD IF YOU'RE UNDER TWENTY FIVE THE CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB BETTER DO YOU THINK I'M A DO YOU THINK THEY ARE BUT THERE WILL BE A REAL MOVE TOWARDS EMPLOYERS LOOKING AT AT THE AGES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE BRINGING ON
WELL I MEAN POSSIBLY BUT THAT'S QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE AGE DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION SO I MEAN THEY CAN'T JUST SAY WE WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE UNLESS IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING LIKE AN APPRENTICESHIP YOU KNOW THERE'S A SPECIFIC REASON WHY YOU WOULD WANT SOMEBODY TO BE A CERTAIN AGE BUT THEY'RE MUCH LOOK AT THE APPLICATION FORMS AND ZI
NO MY GOODNESS BY CHANCE THAT PERSON QUALIFIED WELL IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT ACTUALLY TO ASK INFORMATION ABOUT ABOUT AGE AT THE MOMENT AT THE APPLICATION FORM STAGE SO IT'S UNLIKELY SO I WELL I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE SOME PLOY TO GET ROUND THE RULES AND THERE MAY BE WAYS THAT THEY CAN DO THIS BUT I THINK IT WON'T BE A WHOLESALE MOVED TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO ARE BELOW TWENTY FIVE TO SAVE THAT MONEY AND ON BITE TO LET THIS EXTRA THREE PER CENT
STAN DO YOU LOT HAVE BEEN WINCE SCRAMBLING MOTORED YES YES POSSIBLY ACTUALLY PAYING MORE BECAUSE OF THAT AND THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER DOG TO WAIT IS IT WOULD YOU GUESS WELL I THINK I THINK IF I THINGS AS SOON AS YOU SAY THERE'S GOING TO BE A PRICE INCREASE WHICH IS WHAT THIS ESSENTIALLY IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT SECOND PROPERTY UNLESS THEY'RE BUYING A NEW HOME TO LIVE IN SELLING EXISTING
RESIDENCE MAIN RESIDENCE AND BUYING A NEW PROPERTY TO LIVE IN THEY'LL BE CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND SOON AS YOU SAY BUT I THINK THERE'S A DEADLINE AND PEOPLE RUN FOR IT BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME EVIDENCE OF COURSE AS SOON AS SUPPLY A SEEMS DEMAND INCREASES THEN PRICES GO UP AND I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE PAID OVER THE ODDS TO GET
THEIR TRANSACTION COMPLETED BY MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT AND JUST TO SAY THAT THREE PER CENT I MEAN THE FIGURES ON A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PROPERTY THE STAMP DUTY IS RISING FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SO YOU CAN SEE ON THAT THAT FIGURE YOU CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE FOCUS ON IT BUT THERE ARE SIGNS BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER CHANGES COMING IN NEXT APRIL ON HARROW MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX RELIEF IS CHECKED
I MEAN SOME BUY TO LET AND AS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HER SAYING WE WERE ACTUALLY THINKING OF GETTING OUT I THINK THAT POSSIBLY SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO SCRAMBLES TO MEET THE DEADLINE MAY FIND THAT ACTUALLY THEY COULD HAVE SAVED MORE OF THEY WAITED OH THEY'LL BE THANKING YOU FOR MORNING SARAH PANELS FOUND A SAVVY WOMAN BOUQUET THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
IT'S FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SARGE A JOB IT WILL BE IN PORT TALBOT TODAY VISITING THE THREATENED TO TATA STEEL WORKS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS DOING ALL IT CAN TO FIND A BUYER FOR THE PLANT BUT IT'S BEEN ACCUSED BY FRENCH AND ITALIAN OFFICIALS ARE BLOCKING Y. U. EFFORTS TO MAKE STEEL COMING IN FROM CHINA MORE EXPENSIVE BY IMPOSING HIGHER TARIFFS WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM BRUSSELS BY CHILD THE LUCIEN YOUR SPOKESPERSON FOR EURGH FUR THE EUROPEAN STEEL ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING HELLO WHAT IS YOUR ASSOCIATION'S VIEW ON THE STANCE BRITAIN TOOK ON A TINY STEEL IMPORTS WHEN THIS BECAME HAVE AN ISSUE AT THE START OF THE YEAR WELL WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE LIFTING OF A LESSER DUE TYRELL IN PARTICULAR FOR A LONG TIME THE FACT IS THAT THE U.K. HAS BEEN BLOCKING US THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY MEMBER STATE BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY THE RINGLEADER IN BLOCKING THE LIFTING OF LESSER DUTY THE ABILITY TO LIFT THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PART OF A PROPOSAL EUROPEAN COMMISSION LAUNCHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
AND THE FACT THAT THE U.K. CONTINUES TO BLOCK IT MEANS THAT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S DOING EVERYTHING IT TAKE IT TAKES TWO TO SAVE THE STEEL INDUSTRY IN THE U.K. BUT ALSO IN EUROPE IT'S NOT IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE SO AND THE LIFTING OF THAT LESSER DUTY RULE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN CHINESE STILL COMING INTO YOUR MORE EXPENSIVE IS THAT RIGHT
THAT WOULD BE ONE EFFECT BUT BEARING IN MIND THAT THE CHINESE STILL HE'S DUMPED IT IS IT IS PRICED AT BELOW WHAT IT COST THE CHINESE TO PRODUCE IT THAT'S AGAINST THE PRINCIPLES OF FREE TRADE AND IF YOU HAVE DUMPING YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SEEING PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF ACTUALLY UNFAIRNESS AND THIS IS WHAT ANTI DUMPING MEASURES ARE MEANT TO PROTECT AGAINST
THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS HAS SAID THAT THE REASON THEY OPPOSE LIMITING THE USE OF THE LESSER DUTY RULE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FAVOUR OF PROPORTIONATE RATHER THAN EXCESS EXCESSIVE TRADE DEFENCE AND THAT IS WHAT THEY SAID THE RULE UPHELD
THAT'S A REASONABLE POSITION BUT IT DOESN'T BUT IT'S NOT BORNE OUT BY THE FACTS ON SEVERAL RECENT CASES YOU'VE SEEN TARIFF LEVELS OF THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN PERCENT WHEN FOR EXAMPLE ON THE U.S. IS APPLIED DUTIES OF SIXTEEN OR EVEN TWO HUNDRED SIXTY PER CENT ON SIMILAR PRODUCTS THE FACT IS THAT IF IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PROTECTING THE INDUSTRY AGAINST THE THE DUMPING
THEN IT'S NOT DOING THE IT'S NOT DOING WHAT IT'S DESIGNED TO DO AND THEN FOUR DEFEATS THE POINT YET IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT CHINESE IMPORTS FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE WIRE ROD OR IN ORGANIC COATED STEEL HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN SO YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE TARRANT'S HAVEN'T GONE UP TO THE LEVEL YOU WOULD LIKE BUT THE LEVEL OF IMPORTS HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN WHERE YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCT TYPES REBAR HAS EXPLODED THE CHINESE WENT FROM SELLING TWO TONS OF REBAR TWO NOT TWO MILLION TWO TO THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TO THE U.K.
JUST THIS YEAR IN FOUR YEARS IN MANY OF OTHER OTHER PRODUCT TYPES THE SURGE OF PRODUCTS IS SIMPLY EXPLOSIVE CHINESE IMPORTS WENT FROM FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO SEVEN MILLION LAST YEAR AND WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO RISE THIS YEAR SO WHAT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW THEN DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY OUT OF OF THIS CRISIS CAN KEN BRITISH STEEL BE COMPETITIVE AGAIN
EUROPEAN STEEL AND YOU CAISTEAL IS VIABLE SO THERE'S NO FUNDAMENTAL REASON WHY IT SHOULDN'T GO ON FOR THE NEXT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BUT ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN ALREADY WE FIND OURSELF
DISCUSSING A PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAVE ARISEN AND WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN HAD WE MODERNISE TRADE DEFENCE INSURANCE WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE WE STILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO THAT THE DAMAGE TO SOME EXTENT HE'S ALREADY DONE BUT WE CAN AT THE VERY LEAST PREVENT FUTURE JOB LOSSES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE WORLD IS GETTING FATTER IT'S THE RATE OF INCREASE THAT WORRIES THE RESEARCHERS LED BY SCIENTISTS AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND THEY ARE SOUNDING A PRETTY DRAMATIC WARNING FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THE WORLD WE WILL SOON BE SO OVERWEIGHT THERE TELLING US THAT MANY OF THE DRUGS WE USE TO LOWER CHOLESTEROL REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO COPE PROFESSOR MAJI AS ADEY FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON LEATHER A SEARCH IS ON THE LINE NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING AND THIS IS IT IS IT GOING TOO FAR TO SAY YOU'RE SOUNDING A WARNING FOR THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE AT SANDING WARNING FAR FROM MUCH OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF OBESITY AND FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF PERSISTENT UNDERRATE THAN UNDER NUTRITION AND IT'S THE MATCHING UP OF THOSE TOUR THE BALANCING OUT OF THOSE TWO I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IN THE DECADE
ABSOLUTELY IT'S ABOUT FOOD AND SOCIAL POLICIES THAT MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO NEEDED EAT ENOUGH AND EATING ENOUGH HEALTHY FOODS AND WITHOUT EATING TOO MUCH AND ESPECIALLY FOR MUCH UNHAPPY FOODS AND IT IS IS IT ALL ABOUT FOOD FROM EMPEROR BUT YOUR PRINCIPAL IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING O.K. WHAT DO WE DO IT IS ABOUT WHAT WE
IT IS IT IS TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT OF EITHER FOOD ENVIRONMENT AND OUR FOOD POLICY AND SOCIAL POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY SHAPE WITH PEOPLE LEAVE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON EXERCISE AND ON THE NEED FOR EXERCISE AND OBVIOUSLY FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU READ THE SUMMARY AT LEAST OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY'RE THE REAL KEY TO THIS HAS TO BE GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THAT
ABSOLUTELY EXERCISE IS IMPORTANT BUT WE WANT WORK OUR WAY OUT OF THIS THIS PROBLEM BY BUILDING A FEW EXTRA BICYCLE LANE I MEAN WE WOULD WANT TO LEAVE IN HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ACTIVE BUT FUNDAMENTALLY A FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAN OUR FOOD POLICIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE TO BE ABLE TO DEEHAN AGAIN WE BOUGHT THAT ON THE NUTRITION PROBLEM AND THEY'LL BE CITY AND INCREASINGLY SEE CITY PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW BASICALLY HOW RADICALLY DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE
WE HAVE TO GO A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CHOOSE HEALTHY FOODS OVER UNHEALTHY ONES WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY HOW IT CUTS INTO THE RENT HOW IT CUTS INTO A BETTER SCHOOL FEES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IN PEOPLE HAVE TO FACE PRICES
AND ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE LOWEST INCOME GROUPS THAT DOES AND I DO MANICOTTI SHIP PUSHED THEM TOWARDS UNHAPPY FOODS AND HAVE OBVIOUSLY THE UNHEALTHY PRODUCTS SHOULD BE REGULATED AS WE DO FOR A FOR A TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL DON'T ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS TO DO ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU WOULD PUT THAT TO ONE SIDE AND SAY GOVERNMENTS HAVE GOT NOW HAVE THEY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF TAXING FOODS THAT ARE BAD FOR US AND PERHAPS AS SUBSIDISING THOSE THAT ARE GOOD
SHIRL I MEAN IT IT WOULD BE THAT IN THE FORM OF SUBSIDIES OR OTHER RAYS OF MAKING OF EXCESS HE WANTED THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND FOOD POLICIES ARE COMPLEX BUT IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO IS WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS TO TWO TO PAY FOR A RAMPANT FOOD AND ELECTRICITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT AFFECTS WHAT PRICES DO AFFECT WHAT THEY EAT SOME OF THAT IT'S VERY THOROUGH GET OUT AND THAT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER IN SOME COUNTRIES
OR A MORE GENERAL SORT OF EXERCISE POLITY AND PLACES ARE GETTING CREATIVE ABOUT THESE COUNTRIES THAT ARE STARTING TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH BIG ELATION TOO TO LIMIT ADVERTISING ON UNHEALTHY FOODS THEY ARE TRYING PRESSURE BE FORESTS STORER STOOD TO MAKE HEALTHIER FOODS AT LEAST PHYSICALLY EXCELLENCY BOLT AND THEN THERE IS AGAIN THE PRICE OF THIS I THINK I THINK THEY'RE JUST NEEDS TO BE A SAINT
HE MADE ABOUT HOW MUCH POLICY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SHAPING WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND WE THINK THAT THE LARD THAT HE'D BEEN IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO PROFESSOR MAGIC IS THAT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN FOR YOUR RESULTS ARE IN FROM THE CO OPERATIVE BANK WHICH HASN'T HAD THE BEST OF TIMES LATELY TANYA HAS MOURNERS NO IT'S OF COURSE HAS VERY DIFFICULT TIMES IT'S REPORTED ANOTHER LOSS THIS TIME SIX HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION POUNDS THAT'S FOR LAST YEAR TWENTY FIFTY AND OF COURSE IT'S TRYING TO OFFLOAD BAD LOANS AND BOOST ITS CAPITAL LEVELS JUST TO REMIND YOU IT WAS OWNED BY THE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD CO OPERATIVE GROUP
UNTIL IT HAD TO BE RESCUED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BY SOME BOND HOLDERS IN THAT YEAR IT CONTRIBUTED TWO POINT ONE BILLION POUNDS WORTH OF LOSSES OF FUR IN THE END THIS IS THE LARGEST IN THE CO OP GROUPS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR HISTORY SO IT CONTRIBUTED THOSE LOSSES TO THE GROUP AS A WHOLE
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE DRUGS SCANDAL INVOLVING THE FORMER GERMAN PAUL FLOWERS A LOT TO CONTEND WITH THERE PETER HAHN IS WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO HE'S PROFESSOR OF BANK HERE AT THE INSTITUTE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES WELCOME TO YOU GOOD MORNING MORNING SO ANY BANK REALLY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BALLET SHE'S NOW IT'S FARING SO HOW IS THE CO OPERATIVE BANK NOW DOING YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT AT THE CAPITAL AND WHERE IT'S LENDING MONEY AND HOW GOOD THOSE LOANS ARE AND ALSO THE DEPOSITS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET YOU DO INDEED AND THE CO OP IS
WHILE IT HAS LOSSES ITS CAPITAL WHICH WE SHOULD REMEMBER IS REALLY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR HER LOSSES IF THE BANK SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM HAS INCREASED RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE BALANCE SHEET SO IT APPEARS THAT THE CO OP IS A SAFER ABOUT TODAY THAN IT WAS BUT I WANT YOUR DISPLAYED THEIR LOSSES
SO GOING FORWARD IS THE BANK IT APPEARING TO TURN ITSELF AROUND OR NOT AND IT'S NOT JUST ANY BANK IT HAS AN ETHICAL POLICY AND SO ON SO IT IS DIFFERENTIATED AND IT'S A VERY WELL ESTABLISHED BANK YES IT'S TRYING TO HAVE A DIFFERENTIATED MY CUTTING STRATEGY BUT CO OP IS A BANK THAT STRAPPED TO SMALL LARGELY RETAIL CONSUMER BANK WITHIN A SMALL
MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESS OFFERING AS WELL BUT THAT BUSINESS IS BEING SQUEEZED TODAY IF IF I WENT OUT TODAY TO GET A NEW THREE YEAR MORTGAGE IT OR I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT UNDER THREE PER CENT THREE YEAR DEPOSITS GOING TO GET ME ABOUT ONE AND A HALF PER CENT OF THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRON LOW INTEREST RATE AS A HIDE TO MAKE MONEY A NEW MORTGAGE
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THIS SECTOR BUT FRUITFUL CO UP CALL UP ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IT'S HELPED ITSELF IS IT SOLD OR HALF A NUMBER OF ITS RISKY LAWRENCE
AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A RESERVE OR A CAPITAL AS YOU MANSION FOR THAT BUT THOSE RISK YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER INTEREST RATE OFF AND SO RIGHT NOW I SAID THAT IN THE END THE BONE HOLDER STEPPED IN OR BUY HE'D RATHER THAN A BUYOUT
THERE AREN'T REALLY A MASS OF POTENTIAL BUYERS OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE ARE THERE FOR THIS BANK THIS IS A PROBLEM THERE IS THAT CONSOLIDATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OF SMALLER CONSUMER BANKS IN THE U.K.
AND IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WHO'S GOING TO DO IT WE HAVE THE T.S.B. BANK WHICH HAS BEEN BOUGHT BY A SPANISH BANK RECENTLY BUT WEST AUSTRALIAN GROUP NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK JUST FLOWED AT THE CLYDESDALE BANK WHOOPS THERE'S A NUMBER OF BANKS LIKE THIS BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHICH WINE WILL BUY THE OTHERS OR OF ANY OF THEM WILL BUY EACH OTHER HE'S HARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST WOULD SAY ALSO THAT THE BANK IS LOOKING FOR A NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE THIS YEAR
PLENTY THANKS AT TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN DAY ROLE DID IT BACK IN NINETEEN OH FIVE IT IS
COMPLETION SUCCESSFULLY OF THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE INCREDIBLY IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE SINCE THEN TIM OAKLEY THOUGH HAS WE UNDERSTAND JUST MANAGED IT AND IS ON THE LINE NOW FROM ALASKA HE'S AN EXPLORER WITH THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY HAS BEEN LEADING AN EXPEDITION TO TRY TO FOLLOW IN AMUNDSEN'S FOOTSTEPS AND GOOD MORNING STRATA CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GOOD MORNING YOU'VE MADE IT

THE BUSINESS SECRETARY SERGI JANET WILL VISIT THE THREATENED PORT TALBOT STEELWORKS TODAY DESPITE FACING CALLS FOR HIM TO RESIGN FROM SOME UNION OFFICIALS HE'S CUT SHORT AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO AUSTRALIA IS THOUGHT HE WAS SURE THE WORKFORCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO TRY TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF TATA STEEL'S U.K. PLANTS WHICH THE COMPANY WANTS TO SELL
A STUDY HAS FOUND THAT THE WORLD HAS MORE ADULTS CLASSIFIED AS OBESE THAN THOSE WHO ARE REGARDED AS UNDERWEIGHT THE SURVEY LED BY A TEAM FROM IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON ANALYSE DATA RELATING TO ALMOST TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE OVER FOUR DECADES THE SCIENTISTS WARN THAT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE WILL BE CLINICALLY OBESE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UNLESS THEY CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR
GREATER MANCHESTER HAS BECOME THE FIRST REGION IN ENGLAND TO TAKE CONTROL FROM WHITEHALL FOR RUNNING HIS OWN HEALTH SERVICES A NEW BODY COMPRISED OF THIRTY EIGHT SEPARATE ORGANISATIONS NOW HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR A SIX BILLION POUND BUDGET IT'S HOPED THE NEW APPROACH WILL PROVIDE MORE SEAMLESS HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE SYSTEMS FOR TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE
POLICE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND WALES ARE BEGAN RECRUITING AN EXTRA FIFTEEN HUNDRED FIRE ARMS OFFICERS TO HELP PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM TERRORISM THERE WILL ALSO BE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HIGH SPEED ARMED RESPONSE VEHICLES
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BRAZILIANS HAVE TAKEN PART IN PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AGAINST A CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT DUMA IS SURF IN A SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPREME COURT HAS AGREED TO TAKE OVER A CORRUPTION CASE INVOLVING HER PREDECESSOR NEVER DE SILVA FROM A FEDERAL JUDGE WHO'S BEEN LEADING THE INVESTIGATION
IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF A BUY TO LET PURCHASE IN ENGLAND WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND BAD LUCK AT LEAST AS FAR AS STAMP DUTY IS CONCERNED FROM TODAY YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY AN EXTRA THREE PER CENT BECAUSE OF A MEASURE UNVEILED IN THE BUDGET LAST MONTH SEPARATELY THE BANK OF ENGLAND ONCE LENDERS TO TIGHTEN UP THE WAY THEY EVALUATE MORTGAGES TO BUY TO LET LANDLORDS
SO IS IT ALL OVER FOR BUY TO LET IT IS THAT A GOOD THING WE'LL HEAR FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST THE JOURNALIST ROSIE MILLARD WHO WROTE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT BUY TO LET IN THE BOOM YEARS IN HER TIMES COLUMN AND IS HERSELF A LANDLORD GOOD MORNING MORNING AND THE CHARGE LEVELLED AGAINST LANDLORDS IS THAT YOU ARE A NEGATIVE FORCE IN THE HOUSING MARKET THAT YOU HAVE DISTORTED IT AND MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE TO BUY THEIR OWN HOME WELL I THINK THAT YOU KNOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GEORGE OSBORNE IS DOING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BUY TO LET
WAS AN ANSWER FOR PEOPLE WHO SORT OF PENSION WHOAH WHO ARE DISAFFECTED WITH A FINAL SALARY PENSIONS WHICH ESSENTIALLY COLLAPSED WHO WERE HIS SAVINGS WERE NOT INCREASING IN VALUE AT ALL YEAH BUY TO LET WAS WAS OFFERED TWO IF YOU LIKE A NEW FORM OF OF PENSION AND MANY MANY PEOPLE WENT FOR IT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT IT'S A RACKMAN ESQUE PEOPLE WITH HUNDREDS OF FLATS I'M TALKING ABOUT SMALL INVESTORS LIKE MYSELF HOW MANY PROPERTIES DO YOU HAVE TO
O.K. BUY TO LET PROPERTIES WHATEVER THE RATIONALE AND FANS AND NOW AND NOW HE'S HE'S THE THE THE THE THE FACT IS YOU CANNOT OFFSET THE THE RENTAL YOU HAVE TO PAY TAX ON EVERYTHING YOU GAIN FROM FROM YOUR FLAT IN RENT
AND THIS STAMP DUTY THING BUT MY QUESTION SHE WAS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF A BUY TO LET I THINK ON THE HOUSING I THINK AW IT'S O.K. HANG ON FOR A SECOND FOR HER FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT AT THAT TODAY ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL FIGURES PRIVATE LANDLORDS OWN ALMOST ONE IN FIVE HOMES IN BRIGHTON O.K. RIGHT WELL I THINK THE EFFECT ON ON ON THE OF THE BI SET MARKET HAS COMPLETELY REVITALISED CENTRE OF CITIES THE CENTRE IS TWENTY YEARS AGO NOBODY LIVED IN THE CENTRE OF CITIES
THE BUY TO LET MARKET I THINK IS EFFECTIVELY RE REVITALISE A CENTRE CITIES MADE MORE EXPENSIVE CITIES CITY CENTRE LIVING WAS NEVER FASHIONABLE SUDDENLY YOU HAD IF THINGS LIKE SEX AND THE CITY MANHATTAN LOFT A NEW FORM OF TEN TENANTS
EFFECTIVELY WHO WORKED HE DIDN'T WANT TO OWN A FLAT HE WORKS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES WHO WANTED TO LIVE IN THE CENTRE OF LEEDS MANCHESTER EDINBURGH LONDON AND THE BICEP MARKET THEY'VE USED LIES THE BARTLETT MARKET HUGELY AND ALSO IT'S A WAY OF PEOPLE TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN
LIVES EVER THEIR OWN MONEY OF THEIR OWN DESTINY RATHER THAN PUTTING INTO BONDS INTO EQUITABLE LIFE INTO INTO SO GOOD FROM THE LANDLORD'S POINT HAVE YOU BEEN I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEY'RE PRICED OUT OF THE HOUSING MARKET YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT THE BUY TO LET BOOM HAS OBVIOUSLY PUSHED PRICES UP I WOULDN'T DISTORT THEIR DEBATE THAT HOWEVER WHAT IT WHAT THE THE OTHER REASONS FOR THE
HIKING PRICES IS SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS THE FACT THAT YOU GET YOU CAN'T BUILD A NEW STOCK IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD IN THE CENTRE OF LONDON AND PLANNING REGULATIONS ARE VERY TIGHT AND DEVELOPERS ARE NOT ACTUALLY PUTTING THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS AND BUILDING NEW STOCK WILL LET ME TURN THEN TO BILL DAVIS A SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW SPECIALISING IN HOUSING AT THE CENTRE LEFT THINK TANK THE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH GOOD MORNING MORNING
HAS IT BEEN BUY TO LET BEEN AS AS BENIGN OR FALSERS ASRAR'S EVEN OUT SUGGESTING WHAT I THINK IT'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE INVESTMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF VERY LOW INTEREST RATES AT THE MOMENT BUT ALSO THE COMMENTS YOU MADE ABOUT PENSIONS BUT IN A CONTEXT WHERE WE ARE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOMES AND THE FACT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT NEW MORTGAGE LENDING AND LAST FIVE YEARS SIXTY PER CENT OF THAT GROWTH
HAS BEEN TO BITE A LAX WHEN WE'RE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOMES MORE MONEY CHASING A LIMITED STOCK IS GOING TO PUSH UP THE PRICE OF THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US IT WASN'T THERE WASN'T THERE A MOMENT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN WHEN HOUSE PRICES STARTED TO GO UP THAT COINCIDED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ASSURED SHORTHOLD TENANCY THERE THEY ARE THE INSTRUMENT THAT ESSENTIALLY MADE IT EASIER TO EVICT TENANTS AND GAVE A MORTGAGE LENDERS CONFIDENCE ABOUT ABOUT BUY TO LETTERS AND INVESTMENT
THERE IS THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION THAT SHORT OF TALENT SEES KAREN
BASICALLY LEAD TO RISING RENTS AND THAT CAN MAKE THAT SECTOR IN THEORY MORE VIABLE AND BUT THIS IS A BROADER PROBLEM ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOMES BUT THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT YES IF
IF THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO TERMINATE SENSE EITHER MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO TO RAISE THEIR RENTS TO AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHO'S BEEN THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR LONGEST IF THEY'VE BEEN IN A HOME FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAN THEIR RENTS WILL TEND TO BE LOWER THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUOUSLY RE LETTING RIGHT O.K. SO WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING IN TODAY AND ALSO IN A YEAR'S TIME IN TERMS OF TAX RELIEF IT IS IT IS IT ESSENTIALLY OVER FOR FOR BUY TO LET I DON'T THINK IT'S OVER FOR BITE IF I THINK MANY LANDS IN OR PUT THE RENTS UP I DON'T HAVE YOUR PROPERTIES
WELL I THINK THAT IF THEY PUT THEIR RENT UP THE WHOLE KIND OF VALUE OF IT IS HE'S GOING TO TO TO LOOK AS AS ATTRACTIVE AND I THINK YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GET LANDLORDS CHASING PROPERTIES I DO I THINK IT'S GOING TO HEAT UP THE ENVIRONMENT RATHER THAN COOL IT DOWN I THINK YOU HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S GOING TO HEAT IT UP I THINK WE'VE SEEN A GLUT OF ACTIVITY BEFORE THE STAMP DUTY CHANGE COME THROUGH MORE PROBABLY THAT COOLING DOWN FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AS PEOPLE HAVE RUSHED TO KIND OF GET THEIR PURCHASES WILL UNDERSTAND BRICKS AND MORTAR WE DID I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A GUILT IS REALLY I DON'T WANT A BOND IS IT YEAH I THINK I'VE INTERVIEWED MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF LANDLORD SMALL LANDLORDS WHO DO NOT HAVE HUGE PORTFOLIOS BUT WHO UNDERSTAND

ALMOST TOO ABSURD ISN'T IT AND TO WORKERS AT WALKER'S CRISPS FACTORY IN LEICESTER TOTAL SHOCK I THINK FOR THE CITY'S A WHOLE NOBODY SAW THIS COMING IN I THINK HE'S JUST GIVEN THE WHOLE CITY A BIT OF A BOOST AT THE MINUTE YOU'D BE SURPRISED EVERYWHERE YOU'VE GOT OF PEOPLE JUST TALKING
WHEN BARLOW IS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MANAGER TELL US ABOUT THE PROCESS OF TURNING RED LEICESTER CHEESE BLUE
FOR LEICESTER CITY'S COLOURS WE'VE BEEN PLAYING IN THIS KITCHEN WITH A NUMBER OF HERBS AND SPICES OVER THE YEARS AND ACTUALLY FOUND IF I'M A HERB CALLED RUA FROM RICHARD THE THIRD'S TIME IT GIVES A REALLY NICE KIND OF A LIGHT BLUE TINGE TO TO FOOD REPLACE IN THE ANNATTO THAT GOES IN RED LEICESTER
IT'S GREAT A BLUE LEICESTER CHEESE AWAY OUR UNKNOWN QUANTITY HERE OVER SACHET OF SEASONING HAS BEEN SENT TO US WHAT I DO IS
BIG BAG MAKE THAT THIS EVENING OVER THE PRINTS CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THOSE
FINAL BLUE LEICESTER CHEESE AND ONION CRISPS WHAT RIVER BRINGS A SLIGHT BITTERNESS A SLIGHT SOURNESS SO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CHEESE AND ONION BUT BUT STILL QUITE RECOGNISABLE
SLIGHTLY BLUE BUT THIS MOVE HAS UPSET MAKERS OF RED LEICESTER WITH THE CHEESES HERITAGE DATING BACK TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEIR PROTEST IS HEADED UP BY CAMPAIGNER ON FOOD ISSUES CHEF HUGH FEARNLEY WHITTINGSTALL IS MEDDLING WITH THE GREAT BRITISH CHEESE
RED LEICESTER HAS A GREAT HISTORY BEHIND IT'S A MILD FULL FLAVOURED CHEDDAR LIKE CHEESE AND IT GETS THAT DISTINCTIVE ORANGE RED COLOUR FROM A NATURAL FOOD COLOURING CALLED ALTO IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR GENERATIONS SO WHY MESS WITH IT I HOPE WE DON'T UPSET TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE DOING THIS

MAKING SURE WE CAN CHEER THE TEAM ON TO VICTORY HUGH FEARNLEY WHITTINGSTALL MARKETING A NEW CHRIS ON A WAVE OF FOOTBALL EUPHORIA
IT'S GOING TO APPEAL TO A GROWING BAND OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EAT CRISPS FOR BREAKFAST STATISTICALLY SHOWN THE POTATO CRISPS ARE THE THIRD MOST POPULAR STARCHY BREAKFAST CHOICE FOR SCHOOL AGE KIDS OFF THE CEREALS AND TOAST SO IT'S GOING TO ADD TO THEIR CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT BUT MORE THAN THAT HE SAYS WATCH OUT FOR BIG COMPANIES LIKE THIS FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE CONTROVERSIAL SUGAR TAX IN THE RECENT BUDGET
THEY'RE OWNED BY PEPSICO AND THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY TAKEN A BODY BLOW WITH THE SUGAR TAX AND THEY'VE COME OUT FIGHTING WITH AN AGGRESSIVE MARKETING PLAN FOR A NEW CRISP PRODUCT
I THINK THEY'LL BE UNDONE BY THE BLUE MUST BY THE WEIRD TASTE AND BY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RECOGNISE THAT THIS IS A VERY CYNICAL PLOY BUT STILL TASTY CHILDREN ADULTS REALLY LOVED THE GAME OF FOOTBALL AND I THINK THEY'LL REALLY ENJOY PLAYING WITH THESE BLUE CRISPS NICOLA STAND BRIDGE ARE REPORTING THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY
GOOD MORNING WHEN ER THINGS A ENVY ABOUT THE VICTORIANS IS THAT ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT DEATH AND TO DO THAT FROM AN EARLY AGE SONNY VERY EMPOWERMENT AND HEMS STILL BELOVED OF SOME ADULTS AND WHICH YOUNGSTERS WERE ENCOURAGED TO SING ABOUT OUR LAND FOR LITTLE CHILDREN ABOVE THE PLAY BLUE SKY AND DEED THAT HARDLY PUT ANY OLD JESUS LOVES ME HAS A LINE ABOUT JESUS TAKING CHILDREN UP TO HEAVEN FOR HIS DEAR SEE
WAS OF COURSE A REASON FOR OTHERS FOR MANY VICTORIANS THE FIRST DEATH EXPERIENCE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG SAID BLING AND BOTH RURAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS INFANT MORTALITY WAS SKY HIGH THERE WAS LITTLE PRE AND POST NATAL CARE BUT PLENTY OF MALNUTRITION AND INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS THAT'S FROM AN EARLY AGE SURVIVING CHILDREN HAD A VOCABULARY FOR DEATH
NO THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THE FIRST DEATH MANY OF US DEAL WORTH IS THAT OF AN ADULT OFTEN A GRANDPARENT AND THE PROLONGING OF LIFE THROUGH MEDICAL TREATMENT MEANS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE RECEIVE PALLIATIVE ADMIRAL BUT ECHIDNA IS THIS FROM THE PLETHORA OF HOSPICES WHICH WERE NOT I'VE OWNED TWO GENERATIONS AGO
SOMETIMES IN THESE PLACES AS I DISCOVERED RECENTLY WHEN SPEAKING AT A NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF PALLIATIVE CARE PROFESSIONALS THAT PEOPLE BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT ISSUES CONCERNING DEATH AND THE MEANING OF LIFE WHICH THEY MAY NEVER HAVE PONDERED BEFORE
ERNST YESTERDAY AT THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS COMMENTING ON A DECENT REPORT NOTED THE NEED FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THESE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS
HOWEVER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR TALKING ABOUT THE ENDING OF LIFE SHOULD ONLY BE SHOULDERED BY TRAINED MEDICAL STAFF
ALL OF US NEED TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND OUR FAMILIES AND WITH HER FRIENDS PREFERABLY LONG BEFORE DEATH COMES CLOSE OTHERWISE WE ME EITHER STRUGGLE TO FIND WORDS A STEER CLEAR BOTH OF THEIR CONVERSATION AND WORSE OF THE PERSON WHO'S DYING
I SEE THIS WITH SOME CONVICTION BECAUSE TWO NIGHTS AGO A GROUP OF MY FRIENDS MATE AND THE HOUSE OF A WOMAN WHOM WE LOVE WHO IS NEARING AN END I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD ANTICIPATE WHAT IT WOULD BE A LAKE
FRIENDS HAD SEEN HER RECENTLY AND HAD SPOKEN A LITTLE ABOUT HER LAST JOURNEY AND I DON'T AT ALL THIS HAY SHOULD CALMLY AND FORMED A CLOSE FAMILY THAT HER DEATH WAS IMMINENT AND SHE SPOKE OF HER WISHES REGARDING HER FUNERAL
WE WERE WAITING FOR A FRIEND TO COME BACK FROM HOSPITAL AND BE AT HOME HAD ARRIVAL WAS DE FEARED FUN A BIT OVER FOUR HOURS AND THEN THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED AND WE BEGAN SPENT AENEAS LATEST THING A LOVELY ALLELUIA FROM SOUTH AFRICA
SHE ASKED TO BE WHEELED INTO THE SITTING ROOM AND SHE AND GOING AMBULANCE STAFF LOOK FOR A MOMENT LIQUOR QUEEN WITH HER ATTENDANCE
LATER WE GATHER BURNT HAD PRAYED HER BED WHERE SHE SIGNALLED THAT EACH ONE OF US SHOULD GIVE HER A HUG BEFORE WE SIGN A FINAL SONG
AND WILLING IF ALL OF US AND SOME WE HEALED BY HER OF OUR FEAR OF DEATH AND DYING
THAT WAS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY WITH HIS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AT ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE HEALTH SERVICE AN ENTIRE PIECE OF IT AND WITH A SIX BILLION POUND ANNUAL BUDGET IS BEING HANDED OVER TO LOCAL PEOPLE TO RUN GREATER MANCHESTER FROM TODAY
HE'S IN CHARGE OF ALL ITS N.H.S. TRUSTS AND COMMISSIONING GROUPS LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON PAPER WILL IT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU REALLY NEED SOCIAL CARE IN MANCHESTER INDEED IF YOU'RE GROWING UP IN MANCHESTER AND WANTING TO HAVE A HEALTHY LIFE THERE IS IT A MODEL THAT COULD BE FOLLOWED AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AND PART OF ENGLAND AT LEAST AS IT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED ELSEWHERE PROFESSOR KATH CHECKLAND IS ON THE LINE G. P. PROFESSOR OF HEALTH POLICY AND PRIMARY CARE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER AND IN A MOMENT WE'LL BE HEARING FROM TONY LLOYD IS THE INTRUM MAYOR OF GREATER MANCHESTER VATER FIRST CHECK CHECKLAND FIRST OF ALL GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND I JUST I MEAN THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS WHAT ACTUAL DIFFERENCE PEOPLE IN GREATER MANCHESTER WILL SEE IN THE COMING YEARS
IN THE COMING YEAR IT'LL BE INTERESTING IN THE IMMEDIATE
FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS THERE WILL BE NO DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THE SAME ORGANISATIONS ARE HOLDING THE SAME BUDGETS THEY WERE BEFORE WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS THAT THE LOCAL STATUTORY ORGANISATIONS HAD AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE LOCAL AREA TO SET STRATEGY AND PRIORITIES BUT THE BUDGET'S REMAIN WITH THE LOCAL STATUTORY BODIES THAT THEY'VE BEEN WITH ALL THE TIME BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE COULD IT
WELL IN THE LONGER TERM THERE THERE ARE TWO I THINK BIG OPPORTUNITIES THE FIRST IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES WITHIN MANCHESTER BY LOOKING ACROSS THE CITY AS A WHOLE SO THERE ARE BIG INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WITH LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN THE MORE AFFLUENT BITS OF MANCHESTER AND THE LESS AFFLUENT BITS AND LOOKING ACROSS THE CITY AS A WHOLE GIVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TO TRY AND TACKLE THAT THE SECOND OPPORTUNITY I THINK IT'S MORE LONG TERM WHICH IS THERE AS MANCHESTER TAKES CONTROL OF THE BUDGETS FOR HOUSING AND TRANSPORT AS WELL AS HEALTH
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO START TO ALIGN PRIORITIES BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT AREAS SO ALIGN THEIR PRIORITIES OF WITH HOUSING AND TRANSPORT WITH HEALTH PRIORITIES AND THAT COULD BE QUITE INTERESTING WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN GIVE US AN EXAMPLE THEN HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY MIGHT DECIDE TO DO AND REALLOCATE MONEY FOR WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REALLOCATING MANY BECAUSE AS I SAY THE BUDGET'S STILL FIT WITH THE EXISTING STATUE YOU CAN ALLOCATE MONEY HOW FOR INSTANCE CAN YOU TACKLE INEQUALITY
WELL IN THE LUNG THING THEY CAN REALLOCATE MONEY WITHIN MANCHESTER BUT INDIVIDUAL ORGANISATION STILL HOLD THE SAME BUDGET SO THEY CAN AGREE TO PULL SO THAT INDIVIDUAL C.C. JEEZ CAN SAY O.K. WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME OF OUR MONEY TOGETHER
TO SPEND ACROSS THE WHOLE OF MANCHESTER BUT THAT HAS TO BE BY AGREEMENT OF THE LOCAL ORGANISATION AT I'M JUST STRUGGLE EMILY IF IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN MANCHESTER DECIDE THEY WANT TO DO MY PRINCESS WITH WITH SOCIAL CARE SO MUCH AND PEOPLE'S MINDS AT THE MOMENT IT'D GET COULD YOU REALISTICALLY GO TO HOSPITALS AND SAY WELL ACTUALLY WE WE WANT TO TAKE A BIT OUT OF YOUR BUDGET AND PUT IT INTO SOCIAL CARE OR SOME OTHER AREA WHERE PEOPLE FELT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT MONEY WAS SPENT CAN THAT BE DONE
THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE AND ACROSS THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND SO HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE BUDGETS ARE BEING PULLED ACROSS THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND AND OF SOMETHING CALLED THE BETTER CARE FUND AND THAT THAT'S BEEN YOU BUT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT SINCE THE N.H.S. ACT IN TWO THOUSAND FIX HE WOULD BE IF LOCAL PEOPLE WANTED TO DO IT AND WANTED IT TO GATHER PACE COULD THEY NOW JUST STRUGGLING TO FIND ANYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN NOW THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING UP TO NOW
OH THERE ISN'T THERE ISN'T ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT'S DIFFERENT THAT CAN HAPPEN IN MANCHESTER THAT CAN'T HAPPEN ANYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION UNDER WHICH THESE THINGS HAPPENING IS THE SAME THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE TO THE LEGISLATION THAT THAT'S VERY CLEAR LES THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROFESSOR CHECKING FOR THE HAS TURNED ATTORNEY LLOYD COURSE FORMER LABOUR M.P. LONG TIME LABOUR M.P. INTRO OF GREATER MANCHESTER THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ELECTED MAYOR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GOOD MORNING TO YOU
WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE MY LIFE
WELL THINGS ALREADY HAVE BEEN CHANGING FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE DEVELOPED A MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS GREATER MANCHESTER HAVE BEEN VERY POOR EVEN THOUGH THE NEED HAS BEEN ENORMOUS BECAUSE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FRANKLY WASN'T ABLE TO DELIVER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE THE SOPHISTICATION IF YOU LIKE THAT LOCAL PEOPLE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES NEEDED WE'VE DEVELOPED A MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP WHICH ISN'T JUST ABOUT HEALTH IT BRINGS IN FOR EXAMPLE ORGANISATIONS LIKE POLICING
INTO THAT EQUATION SO IT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT ISN'T SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE PRESENT HEALTH BUDGETS ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS MADE WE CAN REALLOCATE BUDGET'S A LOT MORE QUICKLY AND GOT A LOT MORE SENSITIVELY TO LOCAL NEEDS THAT ALREADY AND ARE DOING THAT BUT ACTUALLY IT'S ALSO BRINGING IN ORGANISATIONS WHO HAVE NEVER WORKED IN THE PAST WITH THE
THE HEALTHY ECONOMY TO TO DELIVER A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF OF CARE FOR PEOPLE AND FOR COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT THE BIG CHANGES NOBODY HAS EVER GOT IN THIS PART OF THE WHITE OR MACHINE CAN'T DO THIS NO ONE'S EVER GOT THE THIRTY SEVEN
HEALTH ORGANISATIONS ROUND THE SAME TABLE TO SAY LOOK WHAT'S A COME AND AMBITION IN THIS HOW DO WE PUT THE FUNDING IN A WAY THAT REALLY DOES DELIVER THE INSULATION BETWEEN HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE YES OF COURSE IT CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE ELSE IT ISN'T BEING DONE ON THE SCALE OF GREATER MANCHESTER ELSEWHERE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE LOCALISM BUT WE'VE NOW GOT THE CHANCE TO MAKE WORK WE'VE TALKED TO A G.P. AND OLDHAM SAID HE'S GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE MONEY
HE'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED IT AT A TIME WHEN THE N.H.S. IS UNDER SUCH PRESSURE AND THERE IS A POTENTIAL FUNDING DEFICIT THE POTENTIAL LOSS BEING MADE BY YOUR
BIT OF THE N.H.S. AS MUCH AS TWO BILLION POUNDS IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEN DOES DOES THAT MEAN FEWER DOCTORS DOES IT MEAN DOES IT MEAN THAT THAT THERE ARE LOCAL CUTS IN N.H.S. SPENDING THAT WOULDN'T BE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE HOW DO YOU KIND OF SORT OUT THAT SIDE
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THAT DEFICIT IS THERE UNDER THE EXISTING MODEL NOW IF YOU'RE ASKING ME DO I BELIEVE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S IS PUTTING ENOUGH MONEY INTO HEALTH OR SOCIAL CARE THE ANSWER IS NO DOUBT WHAT I WILL SAY THOUGH IS THAT WITHIN THEN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING OUR ABILITY TO DESIGN THEIR SERVICES IN A WAY THAT
IT MAKES THEM MORE AND MORE WRAPPED ROUND THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE GREATER MANCHESTER IS BETTER UNDER THERE THE G.M. MODEL THAN UNDER THE THE WHITEHALL IT ISN'T IT ISN'T IT O.K. SAID AT THAT DEFICIT AND THE PROBLEMS THAT IT CAUSES WILL BE SHUFFLED OFF ON TO MANCHESTER AND NOT CENTRALLY KIND OF OLD PEOPLE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT WILL NO LONGER BE CENTRAL AND ACCOUNTABLE IN THE SAME WHETHER THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT
NO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T WITHDRAW FROM ITS OWN FUNDING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THAT'S VERY CLEAR BUT THE BUT THE ISSUE IS THIS IS CAN WE TAKE DEMAND OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM SOUNDS FROM THESE ECONOMIST TYPE WORDS BUT ACTUALLY COME CAN WE
GET THE EARLY INTERVENTIONS THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE DIABETES THAT PEOPLE DON'T SHORT WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHERE THEY NEED LONG TERM HOSPITAL AND EXPENSIVE WHY DO YOU REALLY THINK I CAN
WE CAN DO WE WE CAN AND ARE BEGINNING TO DO THOSE THINGS WE HAVE ALREADY HAD A DIABETES PROGRAMME OTHER AREAS TAKE TAKES ME LIKE THE AT THE ELDERLY WE KNOW ONE OF THE BECAUSE OF THE ELDERLY GOING INTO HOSPITAL IS BECAUSE THE TRIP OR FALL IN THEIR OWN THEIR OWN HOMES WE'VE THAT'S GOT A FAST SERVICE GOING INTO PEOPLE'S HOMES NOW AND PUTTING THINGS THAT STOP THOSE TRIPS TAKING PLACE
IT'S LOOKING AT HOW WE BROADENED THE BASE OF WHAT THE THE THE PUBLIC SERVICES CAN DO TOGETHER AND THERE ARE MANY MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW WE CAN RETHINK THAT THEY DID PUBLIC SERVICE MODEL TONY LLOYD INTRUM I'VE GRETA MATCHED THANK YOU VERY MUCH

NEWS IS READ BY DIANA SPEED
MORE THAN A MILLION LOW PAID WORKERS ACROSS THE U.K. ARE RECEIVING A PAY RISE TODAY WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE EMPLOYERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY STAFF AGED TWENTY FIVE AND OVER AT LEAST SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR
THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS DESCRIBED THE MEASURE AS PERHAPS THE ONE I'M MOST PROUD OF ALL THE T.U.C. EQUALLED THE PAY INCREASE GOOD NEWS FOR ELIGIBLE WORKERS' COUNCILS THOUGH HAVE WARNED OF ITS IMPACT ON THEIR SOCIAL CARE BUDGETS AND THERE ARE FEARS THAT SOME COMPANIES WILL CUT JOBS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO PAY THE HIGHER RATE HE'S OUR ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT ANDY VERITY
A TEN PERCENT PAY RISE IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE RISE MOST WORKERS ARE GETTING BUT THAT'S THE YEAR ON YEAR PAY RISE YOU'LL HAVE RECEIVED TODAY IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE OR OVER AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THE MINIMUM WAGE THOSE JUST ABOVE THAT WAGE LEVELS SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT AS THEY'RE PAID TO HE'S STEPPED UP
ACCORDING TO THE RESOLUTION FOUNDATION FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER OFF THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF IT ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND PART TIME WORKERS
THIS YEAR AT LEAST THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE COMES AT A SURPRISINGLY MODEST COST ACCORDING TO THE LOW PAY COMMISSION EMPLOYERS WILL PAY AN EXTRA SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IN WAGES OR NOUGHT POINT ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WAGE BILL
WHEN THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WERE DIRE PREDICTIONS THAT EVEN AT THREE POUNDS AN HOUR IT WILL COST A MILLION JOBS PREDICTIONS THAT PROVED GROUNDLESS NOW THE OFFICE FOR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY PREDICTS THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THERE WILL BE SIXTY THOUSAND FEWER JOBS THAN THEY'D OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE IN FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS
WORKERS IN SECTORS SUCH AS RETAIL CATERING CLEANING AND SOCIAL CARE WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE LET'S ASK THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BEST WESTERN HOTELS SAYS THE CHALLENGE FOR EMPLOYERS WILL BE ABSORBING THE HIGHER WAGE BILL SO THE EXTRA COSTS ON PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS EFFICIENCIES ARE GOING TO BE THE KEY THING THAT WE PROBABLY FOCUS ON THE MISSION
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE PRICE INCREASES TO A CAUSE
BUT UNFORTUNATELY ACROSS THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR IF THERE'S OFFICIOUS AS CANNOT BE LOCATED OR IF THEY CAN'T ABSORB
ULTIMATELY PRICING MAY INCREASE BY SOME BUSINESSES AS THEY HAVEN'T ALTERED

JAVID HAS FACE CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION FROM LABOUR M. PEASE WHO SAID HIS ABSENCE IN RECENT DAYS AND HIS DECISION TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO A STRAY LEAH ALBEIT AT HIS OWN EXPENSE PROVED HIS INDIFFERENCE TO THE PLIGHT OF STEEL WORKERS

THE STUDY WARNS THAT IF THE CURRENT TREND CONTINUES ONE FIFTH OF THE WORLD WILL BE IN THAT CATEGORY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO SAYS EXCESSIVELY LOW BODYWEIGHT REMAINS A SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE IN THE WORLD'S POOREST REGIONS HE'S OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER

NO THE DIRECTOR OF CARE IS SIMON PITY SEE FROM FRIDAY HE'LL BE PUTTING UP THE WAGES OF HIS LOWEST PAID STAFF TO SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR
IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG CHALLENGE HE DOESN'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE THAT THE LOCAL COUNCIL WILL HELP WITH THE EXTRA COST THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS PUTTING UP COUNCIL TAX TO PAY FOR THE INCREASED COST OF SOCIAL CARE SO SURELY THAT WILL BE PASSED ON TO YOU WHAT IF AT THE COUNCIL
GIVES THAT'S IT'S GOING TO BE PLAYING KETCHUP TO THE ACTUAL COURT ST OF DELIVERING KID SO LET'S SEE JUST TO SUPPORT SOMEBODY APPEAR WEAK WE ACTUALLY NEED LET'S SEE FOURTEEN HUNDRED
IF THE COUNCIL IS ONLY PAYING SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY WE HAVE TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE TO FUNDRAISING IF THE COUNCIL INCREASES FROM SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY
IF INTO EIGHT HUNDRED IT'S STILL FALLING SHORT OF THE ACTUAL COST OF KIT SO IT'S A WORRYING TIME IT IS A WORRYING TIME FOR FOR EVERYBODY GIVIN THE FIT THAT WE LOOK AFTER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED RESIDENTS OR NEEDS REALLY COMPLEX KISS SUPPORT
IT'S IN SECTORS LIKE HAIRDRESSING CLEANING AND HOSPITALITY BUT THE NEW WAGE WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST
IN TEN JOBS IN THE HAIR SALONS PAY THE LEGAL MINIMUM NOT EVERYONE'S CONVINCED THE NEW WAGE WILL MAKE MUCH
WITH JACOB LINDY HE'S A SENIOR STYLIST AS A HAIRDRESSER IS ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE CAFE WHERE WE ARE
JACOB FROM FRIDAY YOU'LL PAY WILL GO UP TO SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY
I THINK IT WILL HELP LIVING IN LONDON COST AT THE LONDON IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AT THE MOMENT I HAVE TO LIVE WITH MY MUM
I CAN'T PHYSICALLY AFFORD TO RENT IT
SO JUST TALK ME THROUGH WE'VE GOT YOUR PAYSLIP HERE JACOB YOU GET PAID EVERY FOUR WEEKS WHAT DOES IT SHOW MINOR
SAYS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR POUNDS AND NINETY PENCE IF I WAS TO RENT A ROOM AND CLAPHAM I WOULD BE SPENDING EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED POUNDS
A CALENDAR MONTH ON A ROOM THAT WOULD LEAVE ME WITH TWO HUNDRED POUNDS TO LIVE ON
PROVE TO ME THAT THIS WE LIKE THIS WAGE OR THE WAY IT'S GOING UP TO CAN BENEFIT MEAN CAN HELP ME AND CAN SUSTAIN ME IN LONDON THAT I WON'T COMPLAIN
CONWAY REPORTING WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM BELFAST BY SIR GEORGE BEIN FORMER CHAIR OF THE LOW PAY COMMISSION HE WAS THERE AT THE TIME THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING AND THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF DIRE PREDICTIONS AT THAT TIME ABOUT HOW WHAT WAS THEN THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE WOULD IMPACT ON JOBS AND CAUSE JOBS TO BE LOST
THERE WAS INDEED THERE WAS A GREAT SCEPTICISM ABOUT THE UTILITY OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THAT TIME BUT I THINK WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS OF SHOW AND THERE WAS A CONSENSUS AMONGST VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY ON THIS ECONOMISTS POLITICIANS NOW WE'VE BEEN CONSERVATIVE POLITICIANS THAT THE IMPACT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE UP TO NOW
HAS HAD VIRTUALLY NO IMPACT ON A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION AND HAS HAD A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT ON ERADICATING LOW PAY AND IN PARTICULAR EXTREME LOW PAY BUT THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT ARE QUITE DIFFERENT ABOUT THE SITUATION THEN AND NOW ONE BEING THAT YOU YOU DID IT DIFFERENTLY DIDN'T YOU YOU SET IT AT QUITE A LOW LEVEL
WE DID SET IT AT A LOWER LEVEL IT CAME IN AT THREE POUNDS SIXTY BUT
THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE STATISTICS WE SETTLED ON WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN A BENEFIT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG AND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THERE WAS WAY ABOVE AVERAGE WAGE INCREASES COMPARED WITH INFLATION IN FACT THOSE INCREASES CONTINUED UP TO THE GLOBAL RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO IT IS TRUE THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR THE NATIONAL AND WAGE WAS LOW
AND INDEED LOWER THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKE AND THE DATA BUT FROM THEN ONWARDS UP UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE RATE OF ENCLOSURE THE DID DID DID YOU DO THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING NOT TO SCARE THE HORSES IT WAS IT WAS A BIG THING AT THE TIME AND EMPLOYS OR GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT YES INDEED I MEAN LEAVING ASIDE THE MISTAKEN THE DATA WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BASQUE AS EVER WE WERE MOVING IN UNCHARTERED WATERS THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THAT
THAT IT WAS BETTER TO GET THE PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHED TO GET THE RATE SET AT A DECENT PERHAPS NOT EXACTLY THE CORRECT LEVEL RATHER COME IN WITH A SWINGEING INCREASE AND THEN HAVE TO BACKTRACK SO WE WE WERE CAUTIOUS AT THE BEGINNING
AND I THINK THE LOW PAY COMMISSION SINCE THEN HAS BEEN VERY PRUDENT IN THE WAY TO SEPARATE AND GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT THE RISKS BEING SIGHTED NOW BYE BYE SOME EMPLOYERS AND INDEED THE MEASURES THAT WE KNOW SOME OF THE THE BIG EMPLOYERS ARE ALREADY TAKING IN TERMS OF CUTTING PERKS AND BONUSES IT'S ALL THE RISKS OF WHAT IS COMING IN TODAY OVERBLOWN IN YOUR VIEW
WELL I THINK THEY ARE IN THE SENSE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE SPECIALLY SMALL EMPLOYERS AND WE CAN COME BACK TO THEM IF YOU WISH HAD BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS THE LOW THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE AND NOW THE NATIONAL A LIVING WAGE WOULD SPELL DISASTER FOR THEM AND THE DISASTER HAS NOT OCCURRED SO I DO THINK THEY'RE OVERBLOWN BUT HAVING SAID THAT
THERE ARE AREAS YOU WERE JUST SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY IN THE SOCIAL CARE SECTOR WHICH ARE GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC I MEAN IT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS WHERE HERE'S A RATE WHICH IN SOCIAL CARE IS SET BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE GENTLEMAN BEING INTERVIEWED POINTED OUT THEY DON'T SET IT TO ENABLE HIM TO MEET THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE YOU'RE NOW THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE AS A RESULT IT BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE
THE CARE REQUIRED AND INDEED EMPLOYERS HAVE FOUND A NUMBER OF WAYS OF TRYING TO GET AROUND AND SOME OF THEM ILLEGAL SOME OF THEM LEGAL BY FOR EXAMPLE PAYING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SOCIAL CARE AND WHO TRAVELLED BETWEEN HOMES OR RESIDENCES ONLY FOR THE TIME THEY'RE NOT NOT FOR THEIR TRAVEL IN TIME AND JUST LIKE ME THOUGH IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT MOMENT ISN'T IT TO NINETEEN NINETY NINE THAT THAT WAS A GOOD TIME ECONOMICALLY THIS IS FAR FROM IT
IT IS BUT I THINK AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT LARGE FOR AND I THINK WILL BE LARGELY UNAFFECTED YOU HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE CHANCELLOR HAS REDUCED CORPORATION TAX HE'S REDUCED NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SMALL FIRMS AND THERE ARE PLUSES AS WELL THAT SOME EMPLOYERS WILL INVEST IN TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGY WITH A VIEW TO INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY AND OF COURSE
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM ECONOMICS FOR A LONG TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE PAID MORE ESPECIALLY LOW PAID THEY SPEND MORE AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT RETAIL AND LEISURE SECTORS WILL PROBABLY GET ABOUT AN EIGHT BILLION BOO SO BASICALLY I THINK THE CLAIMS ARE OVER BUT HAVING SAID THAT
I THINK IT IS TOO COMPLICATED TO CALL IN ADVANCE AT THERE ARE SO MANY PLUSES SO MANY MINUSES THAT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT TURNS OUT THE LOW PAY COMMISSION WILL NO DOUBT HAVE VALUE IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR SIR GEORGE BEIN A THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL LET'S TURN THEN TO SOME ANALYSIS FROM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ON AHMED AND LET'S START WITH THAT AT THAT POINT THE GEORGE BAIN WAS JUST MAKING SAYING THAT THIS EXTRA MONEY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OR SO WILL WILL WILL NOW HAVE AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT PEOPLE WILL SPEND IT
ALL IT IS IS THAT THE CASE THERE WILL BE SOME ECONOMIC BOOST IT IS IT IS A STIMULUS PACKAGE I MEAN IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE THERE'S THE POLITICS OF GIVING PEOPLE A PAY RISE WHICH WILL BE SEEN AS YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING AS A GOOD THING BUT CLEARLY THERE WILL BE A HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE A STIMULUS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL SPEND THAT MONEY
AT AREAS WHERE YOU ARE VERY LOW PAID THAT MONEY TEND TO BE SPENT ON BASICS ON FOOD RATHER THAN ON THOSE TYPE OF LEISURE ACTIVITIES THAT PEOPLE SUGGEST THEY MAY PAY ON BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY LOW PAY BUT THERE WILL BE SOME LIST THERE OF COURSE IT IS ALSO PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPT WHICH WILL BE GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC FINANCES TO MOVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOW PAY AWAY FROM TAXPAYER FUNDED BENEFITS ON TWO BUSINESSES IN THAT BUSINESSES WILL BE A BELIED
TO A SUPPORT LOW PAID PEOPLE THROUGH THIS MINIMUM WAGE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE INCREASE AND THAT AGAIN WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE PUBLIC FINANCES AND FRANKLY TO GEORGE OSBORNE'S EFFORTS TO PRODUCE A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BUT HOW HELPFUL GIVEN THE FACT THAT THESE ARE VERY LOW PAID PEOPLE WELL LESS HELPFUL THAN A DIRECT INJECTION OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS AS COMETS AND HER REPORT
AND YOU SUGGESTED MICHELLE A LOT OF COMPANIES WILL SIMPLY STOP BONUS PAYMENTS WILL STOP PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR WEEKEND WORKING WE'LL STOP DISCOUNT CARDS SO OTHER PERKS WILL BE TAKEN OUT SO THERE WILL BE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S INCOME WHICH WILL BE A NEGATIVE BUT BROADLY THERE WILL BE SOME STIMULUS FROM THIS MOVE AND JUST FINALLY CAR WE'RE TOLD THERE BRITAIN HAS A PROBLEM WITH PRODUCTIVITY DOES HER PAY ROAST MAKE US MORE PRODUCTIVE
THE TENDENCY IS THAT BUSINESSES DEMAND MORE FROM WELL PAID PEOPLE THIS I WAS A WAS WITH A HEAD OF A BIG RETAIL BUSINESS IN IN BRITAIN RECENTLY AND HE MADE A VERY VERY INTERESTING POINT ABOUT FRANCE VERSES BRITAIN IN BRITAIN WHEN PRICES GO UP PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED TO GO ROUND ALL THE SHELVES PUTTING NEW TICKET PRICES ON ALL THE NEW PRICES THAT HAVE GONE UP IN FRANCE IT'S WHAT YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON AND ALL THE PRICES ARE CHAINED ELECTRONICALLY THROUGHOUT THE SHOP
AUTOMATION I THINK WHAT YOU WILL GET FROM THIS IT'S MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE BUT YOU WILL SEE MUCH MORE AUTOMATION IF WORKERS BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE BUSINESS IS LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS FOR HOW THEY RUN THEIR ORGANISATIONS AND I THINK AUTOMATION WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS FOR SOME PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF THE WORKS GO COME ON AHMED THANK YOU
TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST TAKE THE WORK OF ZAHA HADID WILL LIVE ON FOR DECADES PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE GREAT ARCHITECT HE DIED YESTERDAY JUST SIXTY FIVE
HAD A REAL IMPACT ON CITIES AROUND THE WORLD SHE GUESSED EDITED THIS PROGRAMME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN AT THE TIME SHE TOLD SARAH WHAT SHE THOUGHT THE JOB OF AN ARCHITECT REALLY WAS
I THINK YOU HAVE MANY TASKS I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO FIRST HELEN HOW DO YOU AND THEN I DO YES VERY MUCH DEVELOP OVER TIME I THINK IT WAS REALLY LIKE A LOT
ANY OTHER FEEL OF SCIENCE OR MATZO NO HEART WHERE YOU CAN PRACTISE AND TELL YOU
YOUR CLOUGH NEAR PERFECTION AND AWAY
YOU CAN IN SCARES ME A BIT OF SPACE IF IT'S A PUBLIC BUILDING AND SOMEBODY'S GOING INTO ONE OF YOUR PUBLIC BUILD
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THEM TO FEEL
IT'S NOT A LOT I'M JUST FEELING IS ABOUT HOW EXPERIENCED A SPARES AND OUR YEARS IT I THINK IN SOCIETY YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BASIC THINGS WORKED OUT GOOD STRAIGHT
GOING TO HOUSING RED SCORES IN A VERY BASIC STUFF COULDN'T IT SHOULD BE REALLY FANTASTIC BECAUSE I THINK IT INSPIRES PEOPLE AND ALSO
I FEEL GOOD IN THERE SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY VERY FUNDAMENTAL SO I DID AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ANISH KAPOOR THE SCULPTOR HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR FORTY YEARS FIRST MEETING AT THE COLLEGE
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR ALMOST FROM THE START THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT SAR THAT MADE IT CLEAR THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING BE SOMETHING PERHAPS IT WAS SELF BELIEF OR SOME SUCH
CURIOUS QUALITY SHE WITH FEARLESS AND UM
DETERMINED I MEAN AMBITION IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE STRANGE FEELINGS ABOUT BUT WHEN WHIM IT'S AMBITION THAT'S DIRECTED TO WHAT ONE HAS TO DO WHAT ONE HAS TO DO IN LIFE WHAT ONE HAS TO BE THEN I THINK AMBITION IS TRULY ADMIRABLE IN TSAR HEAD
SHIPLOADS OF OF THAT THAT QUALITY THAT FEISTY
I'M GOING TO DO IT QUALITY HOW DID THAT MANIFEST ITSELF IN THOSE EARLY DAYS I THINK IT WAS IN THERE JUST IN HER DEMEANOUR I THINK SHE HAD THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN HER IN HER PHYSICAL SELF TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING WITH HER AND IT WAS
UNCOMPROMISING AND DOWN TO EARTH BUT
UM THE CERTAIN THAT WAS SO HUW'S VIEW SO THAT WAS A VERY WONDERFUL THING ONE HAD TO INTIMIDATING SOMETIMES BUT WE'RE ALLOWED TO SORT OF TAKE IT ON YES AND SHE HERSELF
SAID PEOPLE MISUNDERSTOOD HER SOMETIMES THEY'RE MISUNDERSTOOD HER FEISTINESS FOR UNPLEASANTNESS BUT SHE DIDN'T REGARD HERSELF AS A AS AN ENEMY AND OF OTHER PEOPLE SHOULDN'T WANT TO BE I'M NOT PLEASANT TERRITORY SHE WAS EXTREMELY KIND HEARTED AND NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT BUT UNCOMPROMISING AND I THINK TO DO WOULD SHE
FELT SHE HAD TO DO REQUIRED THAT YOU KNOW UNLIKE MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS ARCHITECTURE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE ONE HAS TO PERSUADE OTHER PEOPLE
YOUR VISION IS WORTH FOLLOWING THAT'S QUITE A TOUGH THING TO DO BECAUSE IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO DO IT SO SO HARD DID THAT WITH THIS DETERMINATION
THAT WAS VERY CLEAR I THINK I'VE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN TODAY PEOPLE SAY SHE WAS A GREAT WOMAN ARCHITECT YES BUT NOT SO SHE WAS A GREAT ARCHITECT OF OF OF OUR TIME SHE'S ONE OF THE GREAT CREATORS IN THE WAY OF ALL OF OUR TIME
OF MY GENERATION AND TO YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT A WORKS YOU AS A SCULPTOR WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT SETS HER APART WELL THAT'S A HARD BROUGHT SOMETHING TO ARCHITECTURE WHICH WAS VERY CLEAR
WHICH WAS ON THE DOUBLE CURL FOR NOW I SAY THAT AS A SCULPTOR AND ONE WHO DOES DOUBLE CURVES MYSELF WHAT DO I MEAN BY A DOUBLE CURVE DRINK HAVE A PRINGLE IN A PREVIEW CURVES
IN ONE DIRECTION ALONG THE HORIZONTAL AND ALONG THE VERTICAL SO IT'S CURVED IN IN IN IN SPACING IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND ONE NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BUILD ARCHITECTURE
WITH THE DOUBLE CURVE I'M TOOL
SHE MADE THAT HAPPEN AND MADE IT SO IT'S AS IF SHE WAS MAKING SCULPTURE
WHICH WAS INHABITABLE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT I MEAN IS GO TO THE OLYMPICS
BUT ZAHA BUILT AND DO A BACKSTROKE LOOK UP AT THE ROOF IT ILLUSTRATES PERFECTLY THIS PRINGLE DOUBLE CURL
THAT IS A HUGE INNOVATION IN TERMS OF A WEED TO MAKE ARCHITECTURAL HALL ANISH KAPOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND WITH THAT MENTION OF BACKSTROKE LET'S TURN TO THE SPORTS NEWS WITH CHRIS DENNIS WONDERFULLY DONE THANKS VERY MUCH MICHELLE ENGLAND'S CRICKETERS WILL HAVE TO GET PAST WEST INDIES IF THEY'RE TO WIN THE WORLD T.

AND A LOOK AT THE WEATHER THERE'S GOING TO BE RAIN ACROSS THE NORTH WEST TODAY BUT ELSEWHERE IT WILL BE DRIER YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR MICHELLE HUSSAIN AND JUSTIN WEBB IT'S TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE AND DIANA SPEEDS HERE WITH THEM
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE TODAY WILL GIVE AN IMMEDIATE PAY RISE TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE U.K. THE MEASURE SETS A MINIMUM RATE OF SEVEN POUNDS TWENTY AN HOUR FOR WORKERS AGED TWENTY FIVE AND ABOVE THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE LOW PAY COMMISSION SIR GEORGE BEEN TOLD US HE THOUGHT THE CONCERNS OF SMALL EMPLOYERS IN PARTICULAR WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT RISING WAGE BILLS HAVE BEEN OVERSTATED
THERE'S A SECRETARY JA JAVID WILL SPEAK TO WORKERS AT TATA STEEL'S PLANT IMPORTS TO IMPORT TALBOT'S LATER HE'S EXPECTED TO TELL THEM THAT MINISTERS ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN TO SAFEGUARD THEIR JOBS THE EUROPEAN STILL ASSOCIATION TOLD US THAT WASN'T THE CASE HAS BRITAIN HAD BEEN A RINGLEADER IN BLOCKING MOVES TO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY FROM CHEAPER CHINESE STEEL
GREATER MANCHESTER HAS BECOME THE FIRST ENGLISH REGION TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RUNNING ITS OWN HEALTH SERVICES THIRTY EIGHT ORGANISATIONS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO FORM A NEW BODY WHICH WILL HAVE A BUDGET OF SIX BILLION POUNDS A GLOBAL STUDY SAYS THERE ARE NOW MORE ADULTS CLASSED AS CLINICALLY OBESE THAN THOSE WHO ARE CATEGORISED AS UNDERWEIGHT THE RESEARCHERS CONCLUDE THAT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE WILL BE OBESE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IF THEY FAILED TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR
IT IS TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE THERE SOME VERY GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE FIGHT AGAINST H.I.V. TODAY NOT NEWS IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT BUT ENCOURAGING NONETHELESS RESEARCHERS HAVE MANAGED TO USE GENE EDITING TECHNOLOGY TO TAKE THE VIRUS OUT OF INFECTED CELLS THE STUDIES LEAD AUTHOR WAS DOCTOR COME OUT LILY OF THE LEWES CAT SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT TEMPLE UNIVERSITY
THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE BEER SEGMENTS OF THE VIRAL JEANNOT INTO LABARDI TRUDY
IT'S THEM ON STRAITS THAT IT HAS A CAPACITY THAT ONCE IT IS PRESENT IN THE PATIENT BUDDY
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALSO ELIMINATE THEIR BARREL GENOME IN INDIA HUMAN BODIES SO IT HAS HUGE POTENTIAL FOR QUINN IT
GETTING INTO THE QUEEN EEK REQUIRES A PRU IT'S TSONGA FINDINGS THAT REACH OUT ALREADY EMPTY INTO THE QUEEN GOT TRIALS WITHIN THREE YEARS THAT'S TURNED TO PROFESSOR MATTHEW COBB WHO'S FROM MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY MADE A PROGRAMME FOR RADIO FOREST ME ABOUT GINA SAYING GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING INTERESTING IF IF NOT EXCITING
WELL KIND OF IN BETWEEN THE TWO YEAH IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THERE'S ANY CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT BUT THIS IS PART OF A WAVE OF RESEARCH THAT'S BEING DONE USING THESE NEW TECHNIQUES TO ATTACK H.I.V. IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER DISEASES
AND THE PROFESSOR THERE WAS REFERRING TO THE NEED NOW TO HAVE APPROVAL IT IS ISN'T IT A CONTROVERSIAL AREA
THERE'S TWO ASPECTS TO THIS THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES YOU TO CHANGE THE JEANS NOW WE'VE GOT TO KIND OF SETS OF OUR GENES WE'VE GOT OUR SETS IN WHAT'S CALLED A GERM LINE OUR EGGS AND A SPERM AND EGG AND BE PASSED ONTO THE NEXT GENERATION AND AT THE MOMENT I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO DO OR WE SHOULD
GOT TO THINK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHAT IS MUCH LESS CONTROVERSIAL IS USING THIS TECHNIQUE TO EDIT WHAT I CALL A SOMATIC CELL LINE SO THAT'S THINGS LIKE LIKE BLOOD WHICH IS WHAT THIS APPROACH IS LOOKING OUT AND THAT WOULD NOT BE PASSED ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION SO EFFECTIVELY YOU CAN ENGINEER THE BODY TO CURE ITSELF FROM THE INSIDE AND THE WHOLE SET OF THESE APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES
IN AUTUMN LAST YEAR A ONE YEAR OLD GIRL IN LONDON CALLED LEILA WAS TREATED FOR LEUKAEMIA AT GREAT ORMOND STREET USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT KIND OF GENE THERAPY ANOTHER DIDN'T CURE HER IT ENABLED HER TO GO INTO REMISSION FOR SOME TIME AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY OF FINDING A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT FOR HER SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALLOWED AT THE MOMENT AND A CURRENT ETHICAL PROCEDURES AND IF WE DID MANAGE TO GET IT RIGHT AND TO DO IT ON A LARGER SCALE IT IS
POTENTIALLY QUITE TRANSFORMATIONAL ISN'T IT PROMOTES ABSOLUTELY SO THIS IS A ROOM AT THE MOMENT THE BIG PROBLEM FOR THESE GENE EDITING TECHNIQUES IS DELIVERING THE THE ENZYMES THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE OF MANIPULATING THIS WHICH THE THINK ALL CRISPER IN THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH IS DELIVERING IT TO THE RIGHT CELLS AND
ONE OF THE EASIEST THINGS TO GET HOLD OF HIS BLOOD SO ANY BLOOD BORNE DISEASE WHETHER IT BE LEUKAEMIA OR H.I.V. THEN YOU'VE GOT A WAY OF ACTUALLY MANIPULATE AND TAKEN THE CELLS THE STEM CELLS OUT OF YOUR BONE MARROW MANIPULATING THEM PUTTING THEM BACK IN AND THEN YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY OF ACTUALLY CURING THIS DISEASE AND
FOR THE H.I.V. RESEARCH THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT ONLY SHOW THAT THEY CAN ELIMINATE THE DISEASE BUT BY INCLUDING THIS LITTLE GENETIC TRICK INTO INTEGRATING INTO THE CELLS THEY CAN THEN BE PROTECTED FROM FUTURE INFECTION AND THAT'S VERY EXCITING BUT WHEN THAT'S DONE OF THE CELLS THEMSELVES
CHANGED FOREVER AND IT DO THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM THAT THEY DIDN'T BEFORE THIS AND DAV AND MIKE THAT POTENTIALLY CAUSE DIFFICULTIES THAT AT THE MOMENT WHERE I'M AWARE AH WELL THAT'S THE WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT REGULATION AND CONTROLLING APPROVAL THAT'S WHY HE CAN'T GO STRAIGHT FORWARD TO DEVELOPING A THERAPY FOR THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW TO WE'D DO IT OWEN WELL YOU CAN FIND WELL THERE IS THAT BUT YOU CAN FIND AN AWFUL LOT OUT FROM ANIMAL MODELS
BUT THE BIG WORRY IN EVERYBODY'S MIND IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WAS THIS THING CALLED GENE THERAPY THAT PEOPLE DEVELOPED IN THEY WERE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AND THEN WHEN THEY CAME TO DO THE FIRST HUMAN TRIALS IN FACT IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG AND A NUMBER OF PATIENTS DIED AND THIS CAUSED A MASSIVE RETRACTION IN AN INTEREST IN THIS AREA BUT THESE NEW TECHNIQUES OF FAR MORE PRECISE AND IN GENERAL I THINK PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC AND THE VERY FIRST TECHNIQUES
FOR USING THIS NEW CRISP THE TECHNIQUE SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND THERAPIES DEVELOPED IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND ALREADY THERE ARE H.I.V. TREATMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE U.S. WHICH HAVE LED TO A NUMBER OF PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO STOP TAKING THEIR ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT AND EFFECTIVELY HAVING BEEN CLEARED OF THE DISEASE I THINK THESE ARE THERE IS DEFINITELY A GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE HORIZON PROFESSOR MATTHEW CUP FROM MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES TONIGHT TONIGHT THERE'S NEW RESEARCH OUT THIS MORNING ON HOUSE PRICES JOHN IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL AS THE EXTRA STAMP DUTY THAT'S COMING INTO FORCE TODAY TONYA WHERE YES AS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL THREE PERCENT IN STAMP DUTY ON PROPERTIES SUCH AS BUY TO LET PROPERTIES AND SECOND HOMES THAT COMES INTO EFFECT TODAY AND NATIONWIDE PUBLISH IT'S ALSO HAS PUBLISHED ITS QUARTERLY HOUSE PRICE INDEX SHOWS THAT U.K. HOUSE PRICES ROSE NOT POINT EIGHT PER CENT IN MARCH
FEBRUARY'S PRICES AND THAT PUSHES THE ANNUAL INCREASE UP TO A THIRTEEN MONTH HEIGHT OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT SO THAT MEANS THAT THE AVERAGE HOUSE WILL GO ON SALE FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUART THEM UP TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ONE POUNDS IN THE U.K.
THE ROBBER GARDEN AND NATIONWIDE'S CHIEF ECONOMIST AT JOINS US NOW ROBERT DOES THIS SUGGEST A LITTLE BIT THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EXTRA BUYING OF PROPERTIES IN THE RUN UP TO THIS STAMP DUTY BEING INTRODUCED
I THINK THAT'S QUITE LIKELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF HER SPACE GROWTH HAD BEEN IN A REALLY NARROW RANGE FOR FOR QUITE A LONG TIME REALLY SINCE EARLY LAST SUMMER FOR THREE TO FIVE PER CENT WE'VE WE'VE SORT OF MOVED ABOVE THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD THEIR PURCHASES TO TRY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER TAX LIABILITIES IF THEY'RE BUYING A SECOND HOME THE DEMAND TO PLAY BANDS IS REALLY TIGHT AT THE MOMENT WITH THE STOCK OF
PROPERTIES ON THERE ON THE MARKET AT A THIRTY YEAR LOW SO I THINK IT COULD WELL HAVE NUDGED THE DEMAND TO PLAY BOUNCE IN THE LEAD THAT INCREASE IN PRICE GROWTH THERE HAS OBVIOUSLY WITH THIS VERY SHOP RUN UP IN PRICE HAS BEEN A CONCERN PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH EAST BEEN A CONCERN THAT WE'RE SAYING ANOTHER BUBBLE ARE WE
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE ACROSS THE U.K. IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT MOST AFFORDABLE DE METRIC SHOULD LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT COST TO SERVICE TYPICAL MORTGAGE I'M NOT PARTICULARLY STRETCH THAT'S IT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THINGS ARE PARTICULARLY STRETCH BUT THERE ARE A FEW REGIONS WHERE AFFORDABILITY DOES LOOK MORE STRETCHED ESPECIALLY IN LONDON IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE HOUSE PRICES ARE COMPARED TO THEIR PRE FINANCIAL CRISIS PEAK THERE REALLY IS QUITE A DIVERSE PICTURE ACROSS THE U.K. AND IN LONDON HOUSE PRICES ARE FIFTY PER CENT ABOVE THEIR PRE CRISIS
HI WE'RE IN THE U.K. OVERALL THERE'S JUST NINE PER CENT ABOVE AND IN MANY PARTS OF COUNTRY WALES SCOTLAND AND NORTH OF ENGLAND PRICES ARE STILL SOME SIX OR SEVEN PER CENT BELOW THE PRE CRISIS LEVELS SO THERE'S QUITE A VARIED PICTURES YOU LOOK ACROSS THE U.K. AND THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY IN A WAY IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING WITH PRODUCING NATIONWIDE PICK NATIONWIDE FIGURE THAT ACTUALLY THE NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE IS GETTING BIGGER
SO IT'S NOT TERRIBLY REPRESENTATIVE AS KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS AND THEY ARE PERSISTING TO SEE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LATEST QUARTER PRICES IN THE SOUTHERN REGIONS OF ENGLAND PRESSURES IT HAVE THEY WERE NEARLY TEN PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR WAS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THEY WERE BY LESS THAN TWO PER CENT TO THIS THIS DISPARITY IN REGIONAL PERFORMANCE IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT JUST SHOWS FEW SIGNS OF A BEATING AT THE MOMENT ROBERT GARDNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TO NINE A NEW ORGANISATION WHICH WILL INVESTIGATE MEDICAL ERRORS IN HOSPITALS COMES INTO EXISTENCE TODAY FOR HEALTHCARE SAFETY INVESTIGATION BRANCH IS AIMED AT GETTING THE N.H.S. TO LEARN FROM ITS HER MISTAKES AND PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS THE WRITER AND FORMER SPORTS AND MATTHEW SYED WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DRAFTING THE PROPOSALS FOR IT AFTER HIS BOOK ON PERFORMANCE BLACK BOX THINKING CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE HEALTH SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT HERE'S HIS TAKE ON HOW HOSPITALS CAN BE SAFER
SEVEN AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF AVOIDABLE MISTAKES IN ENGLISH HOSPITALS
ONE OF THESE DEATHS WAS JOSHUA TICK THEM HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED HAD THEIR LESSONS FROM EARLIER DEATHS IN THE VERY SAME WARD BEEN LEARNED
THIS IS HIS FATHER JAMES AFTER JOSHUA WAS BORN MY WIFE BECAME VERY POORLY AND WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT JOSH BUT WE WERE REASSURED THAT HE WAS O.K. THERE WAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WE NOW KNOW THAT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE HAD MANY SIGNS OF THE SAME INFECTION THAT MY WIFE WOULD ACTUALLY COLLAPSED FROM BUT EVERY TIME WE ASKED WE WERE JUST REASSURED HE WAS O.K. AND THIS CARRIED ON TILL SHE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO A DOCTOR
UNTIL HE WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF AGE WHEN MY WIFE FOUND HIM ACTUALLY COLLAPSED IN HIS COT AT THAT POINT HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE SPECIAL CARE UNITS IN THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HIM HE STRUGGLED FOR NINE DAYS WITH VARIOUS INTENSIVE CARE AND JOSHUA PASSED AWAY IN IN FAIRLY HORRIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES
MEDICAL ERROR CAN BE DEVASTATING BUT I BECAME INTERESTED AND IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH CARE NOT FOR A DOCTOR
BUT A SPORTS COACH SIR DAVE BRAILLE'S FOR THE MAN BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF BRITISH CYCLING HE REGARDS MISTAKES AND WEAKNESSES NOT HIS PROBLEMS TO BE CONCEALED BUT HIS PRECIOUS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES HE CALLS IT MARGINAL GAINS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE RADICAL CHANGE YOU CAN STAY THE SAME AND EXECUTE BETTER
OR MORE PRECISELY AND YOU'LL IMPROVE I COULD MAKE A LITTLE CHANGE AND EXECUTE BRILLIANTLY AND IMPLEMENT BRILLIANTLY AND YOU'LL IMPROVE AND THAT'S THAT WHOLE CONCEPT OF MARGINAL GAINS WERE IS THAT EXECUTIONS THE IMPLEMENTATION IS CONTINUOUSLY SEARCHING OUT THOSE LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS PROGRESSION OF PERFECTION AND I THINK IT BECOMES A MINDSET IS EXCITING PEOPLE LIKE TO GET BETTER WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU'VE GOT THAT MOMENTUM YOU FEEL YOU GETTING BETTER THAN EVERYBODY BUYS IT
ONE DOCTOR WHO USES THIS APPROACH IS MARTIN ELLIOTT PROFESSOR OF CARDIO THORACIC SURGERY AT BRITAIN'S TOP CHILDREN'S HOSPICE
I'M IN THE CARDIAC WARD AT GREAT ORMOND STREET HOSPITAL AND IT'S A REMARKABLE PLACE THERE ARE MACHINES THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE ARE PATIENTS LOTS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON IN REAL TIME
AND MARTIN DOES THAT ENABLE OR MAKE IT EASIER FOR ERROR AND MISTAKES TO CREAM
CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR EIRA YOU'VE GOT MACHINE AND PEOPLE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN THE PATIENT TO INTERACT TOGETHER PLUS SOMEBODY WRITING A PRESCRIPTION DOWN FOR EXAMPLE EACH OF WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL
YOUR DEPENDENCE ON AN INCREDIBLY HIGH DEGREE OF TRAINING AND SKILL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED TO THINK THAT THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION THAT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF CONCERNS IN DIFFERENT HOSPITAL TRUSTS AND PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE
FOUR CLINICIANS TO SPEAK UP WILL BE SIGNIFICANT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET THAT HERE IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FEAR OF BEING BORN
HONEST MISTAKES IS UNDERMINING OPENNESS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THAT THAT FEAR OF BLAME IS A HUGE RISK WE'VE HAD TO WORK REALLY HARD TO GET AWAY FROM BLAME IN OUR OWN UNIT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
AND PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET DONE FOR NEGLIGENCE AND SO FIND IT HARD TO TURN UP FOR A MEETING AND FEEL THESE THINGS OF BEING OPENLY DEBATED SO I THINK PROVIDING A SAFE SPACE WHERE YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT THEY CAN TALK FREELY
HE'S A VERY VERY GOOD STEP THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE IN WHETHER OR NOT THE N.H.S. CAN LEARN FROM THE LESSONS THAT EMERGE IN THOSE THINGS AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNANCE OF THE N.H.S. CAN DISTRIBUTE THAT LEARNING FAST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
THE CHANGES ARE OFTEN SMALL BRAILLE'S FROM STARTED TRANSPORTING MATTRESSES FROM STAGE TO STAGE DURING THE TOUR DE FRANCE FOR A MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT BEEN SLEEP QUALITY HIS TEAM STARTED USING ANTIBACTERIAL HAND TO CUT DOWN ON INFECTIONS
IF THIS SOUNDS TRIVIAL CONSIDER THAT THOUSANDS USED TO DIE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE DOCTORS DIDN'T STERILISE THE TUBES PUT INTO PEOPLE'S BODIES AFTER AN OPERATION
PROPER INVESTIGATION DISCOVERED THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AND RECOMMENDED THE SOLUTION THE CHECKLIST WHAT HAPPENED THE DEATH RATE FELL TO ZERO A MARGINAL CHANGE
BUT A HUGE PAY OFF THAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT HE'S DAVE BROWSE FOR THE GAME I THINK THIS IDEA IN SPORT PARTICULARLY OR AND ANY WALK LIKE I GUESS OF BEING PERFECT THE PERFECT PERFORMANCE WITH ABSOLUTE GOLD MEDAL WINNING PERFECT PERFORMANCE IT'S DAUNTING WE'RE NOT PERFECT WE HUMAN WE'RE NOT ROBOTS WE WERE FAULTY WE'RE NOT WIRED PROPERLY SO WE INEVITABLY GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY IF YOU ASKED THEM COULD YOU GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER
COULD WE MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW MOST PEOPLE PUT DOWN SOME GO YOU COULD ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH WE COULD GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER O.K. LET'S GO FOR THAT
NOT REPORT WAS FROM THE WRITER FORMER SPORTSMEN MATTHEW SIRED BY NOW HE'S FOURTEEN MINUTES TO NINE IF YOU LIVE IN WADEBRIDGE IN CORNWALL AND THE SUN'S OUT YOU CAN GET CHEAP ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY VERY CHEAP JUST FIVE PENCE A UNIT TO IT'S ORGANISED BY TEMPUS ELECTRICITY YOU NEED A SMART METER THERE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO KNOW WHEN YOU USED TO POWER THE IDEA IS VERY SIMPLE YOU SHIFT ENERGY USE TO THE TIME OF DAY WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING AND POWER AT LEAST IN CORNWALL IS PLENTIFUL
AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE JUST OVER THREE MILLION SMART METERS IN USE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS FIFTY THREE MILLION IN HOMES AND BUSINESSES BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THE ROLAND'S GOT A GATHERS GATHERED PACE SASHA BEST SMOKE IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SMART ENERGY G. B. WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF PUBLICISING THE ROLL OUT PROFESSOR STEPHEN THOMAS IS ON THE LINE EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF ENERGY POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GREENWICH MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING FIRST OR SATURDAY HOUSE ACTUALLY GOING IN
THAT SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A BIG INCREASE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET DONE PRETTY QUICKLY
THERE'S A VERY BIG TASK TO DO BUT IT'S A WHITE VITAL TASK COMING THEY'RE FOR REAL REASONS WHY SMART METERS ARE BEING FITTED IT'S TO MAKE OUR ENERGY SYSTEM MORE RELIABLE MORE SUSTAINABLE ON ENVIRONMENTAL GROUNDS TO RADICALLY IMPROVE THE SERVICE THAT WE RECEIVED TO GO FROM AN ANALOGUE VERY VERY ANTIQUATED SERVICE TO A DIGITAL ONE AND TO HELP US OR REDUCE ENERGY AND DO THAT IN WAYS LIKE SUPPORTING PEOPLE ON USING INTERESTING TARIFFS IN THE WAY THAT THIS THIS TRIAL DOWN IN CORNWALL IS DOING
ALL FOUR OF THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT THE BIGGEST INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES COUNTRIES HAD AN ENERGY IN A GENERATION SO A LOT'S HAPPENED THREE MILLION METRES IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S A BIG PROGRAMME AHEAD AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG PROGRAMME OF COMING AND CONTACTING EVERY HOUSEHOLD AND TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE METERS IN ALL OF OUR HOUSEHOLDS AND PROFESSOR STEPHEN THOMAS DO YOU APPROVE OF THAT PROGRAMME
I THINK IT'S IT'S A VERY BIG AND IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAMME OF THE METERS ARE GOING TO COST EVERY HOUSEHOLD ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE NOT VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THESE METERS ARE REALLY FOR WHAT THEREFORE HE'S NOT SELLING ELECTRICITY CHEAPLY AT OFF PEAK TIMES
WHAT THEREFORE IS TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM USING ELECTRICITY AT PEAK TIMES BECAUSE PEAKS ARE EXPENSIVE TO MEET SO IF YOU CAN REDUCE DEMAND BY CHARGING VERY HIGH PRICES AT THAT TIME THEN YOU CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENT COSTS BUT OF COURSE THAT RAISES SERIOUS WELFARE ISSUES
YEAH LIKE WHAT WELL FOR EXAMPLE THE THE PEAK TIME IS TYPICALLY ON A WEEKDAY AT PERHAPS SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WHEN EVERYBODY COMES HOME SWITCH IS ON THE OVEN SWITCHES ON THE LIGHT SWITCH IS ON THE TELEVISION THE OFFICE IN THE FACTORY ARE STILL RUNNING
AND THE ISSUE IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE PEOPLE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY AT THAT TIME WHEN THEY NEED THEIR ELECTRICITY MOST THEN THAT'S HAS VERY SERIOUS SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES PEOPLE ARE ALREADY AFRAID OF USING ELECTRICITY BECAUSE OF THE PILLS IF
AT THAT TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST TO TO STAY WELL THEY SEE A VERY HIGH PRICE THEN THOSE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE VERY SERIOUS SASA DESERT DESMOND IT MAY BE BETTER FOR THE COMPANY NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU'RE USING A TRYST
I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY KEY FOR US TO GET ASSISTANCE THE MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE DO HAVE A DIGITAL EDGED ENERGY SYSTEM AND THAT WE CAN REALLY TARGET THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT I THINK STEPHEN IS SAYING HE'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT JUST RECENTLY I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE IS ON A PRE PAYMENT METER SHE WAS A WOMAN IN HER EIGHTIES LIVING ON HER OWN
TODAY'S PREPAYMENT ANALOGUE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD HAVE TO GO OUT AT NIGHT IN THE RAIN TO CHARGE UP HER PREPAY KEY JUST TO BUY ENERGY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS LAST YEAR I SPOKE TO HER AND SHE SLIPPED ON THE WAY HOME AND BROKE HER HIP
THAT'S WHAT AN OLD ENERGY SYSTEM AN OLD ENERGY TECHNOLOGY LEADS YOU DOING WITH A SMART METER THAT PERSON IN A VERY VULNERABLE PERSON
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE UP HER ENERGY FROM HOME AND INDEED AS STEPHEN SAYS IF SHE WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS VULNERABLE AND NEEDED SUPPORT THAT SUPPORT COULD BE PROPERLY TARGETED IT CAN ONLY DO THAT WHEN THERE IS REAL DATA AND THAT'S WHAT SMART METERS JAN I SUPPOSE THEN THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TRUST ISN'T THERE PROFESSOR THOMAS THAT ACTUALLY THAT HELP THAT IS NEEDED DOES COME WHEN WE DO WHEN ALL THE COMPANIES KNOW EXACTLY WHEN EACH OF US IS USING ELECTRICITY
WE HAVEN'T BEEN VERY GOOD AT LOOKING AFTER THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN FUEL POVERTY AND I THINK THE ISSUE THEN BECOMES WELL HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE AT THOSE PEAK TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE IT DOWN TO THE COMPANIES AND WE KNOW WE DON'T TRUST THE COMPANY
WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT UP TO THEM TO DECIDE HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU COULD CHARGE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS CAN YOU IF YOU'VE GOT THESE METERS WELL YOU COULD TO SAY WHO WOULD SET THAT AMOUNT THOUGH ANT DO YOU TRUST THE COMPANIES IN THE RESEARCH SAYS THAT WE TRUST THEIR ENERGY COMPANIES LESS THAN WE TRUST THE BANKS I THINK THERE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE
AS A TELLING POINT ISN'T IT WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE THERE PROFESSOR STEVEN THOMAS SASHA DASH MUCK AS WELL THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE AUTHORITIES IN TURKEY ARE ROUNDING UP SIRHAN REFUGEES AND SENDING THEM BACK INTO SYRIA AND IS THE CLAIM BEING MADE THIS MORNING BY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL COMES DAYS AFTER REPORTS THAT TURKISH BORDER GUARDS HAVE BEEN SHOOTING AT REFUGEES TO TRY TO KEEP THEM OUT IN TURKEY OF COURSE HAVE JUST DONE A DEAL ON REFUGEES THAT SUGGEST THAT TURKEY IS A SAFE COUNTRY FOR THEM
JOHN DYSON IS AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S DIRECTOR FOR EUROPE IN THE CENTRAL ASIA AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU AND YOU HAVE PROPER EVIDENCE TO YOU THAT THIS IS HAPPENING THE REFUGEES ARE BEING
WE SPENT A WEEK ON THE GROUND AND HAD TYPED PROVINCE LAST WEEK A NUMBER OF RESEARCH IS TALKING TO A WIDE RANGE OF OF PEOPLE REFUGEES THEMSELVES A RANGE OF OF AID WORKERS IN THE REGION AND ABLE TO DOCUMENT YOUR NUMBER A VERY CONCRETE CASES OF RETURNS OF GROUPS OF UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND ONE OCCASION TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THIS IS IN FACT IN THE REGION ARE FAIRLY OPEN SECRET I MEAN IT'S KNOWN IT'S ACKNOWLEDGED BY A SERIES OF ORGANISATIONS WORK IS INDEED INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION
AREN'T PARTICULARLY TALKING ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT WAS THE POLITICS OF IT AS SUCH AT THIS IS THAT THE HEART OF THIS EASY TURKEY DEAL IS CLEARLY ILLEGAL TO RETURN REFUGEES TO THE COUNTRY THAT THEY COME FROM IT'S LIKE QUASI LEGAL TO RETURN REFUGEES IS THE E.U. IS PROPOSING TO DO TO A COUNTRY THAT IS ENGAGED IN IN THIS PRACTICE THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT ISN'T IT BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THE YOU WOULD SAY NO TACK IS A SAFE PLACE FOR A FEW IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO RETURN PEOPLE TO TELL YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE OF THIS
YOU HAVE PROOF NOW THAT IT ISN'T IT'S UNAMBIGUOUSLY NOT SAFE FOR FOUR FOR SYRIANS WHO ARE NOW EXPOSED TO YOU TO THIS RISK AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SMALL NUMBERS IF YOU IF YOU ADDED UP OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE'RE FAIRLY CONFIDENT SAYING THIS MUST BE SEVERAL THOUSAND
A SYRIAN REFUGEES ALONE IN THEIR AFGHANS BEING RETURNED INVOLUNTARILY AS AS WELL SO THEY'RE I THINK VERY REAL RISKS THAT THOSE THAT THE E.U. IS INTENDING TO SEND BACK TO TURKEY WILL BE RETURNED IN TURN TO TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY FACE A REAL THREAT OF PERSECUTION ARE SO IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE COMING TO THE BORDER AND BEING TURNED BACK IT'S PEOPLE ALREADY
IN TURKEY YOU'RE SAYING VERY MUCH ROUNDER AND TAKEN AND ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING EXAMPLES ARE A FAMILY THREE CHILDREN PLAYING IN A PARK IN ATTACK HERE THEY'VE BEEN IN TURKEY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ROUNDED UP AND SHIPPED BACK AFTER A PERIOD IN DETENTION THREE DAYS LATER ACROSS THE BORDER AND ARE NOW IN THE ATMA CAMP IN IN SYRIA WHERE THE CONDITIONS ARE ATROCIOUS STEP PARENTS ARE STILL IN TURKEY
AS SO YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TURKEY AND WOULD LIKELY BE IN THE SAME SITUATION IS THOSE WHO'D BE RETURNED TO TURKEY EIGHT UNREGISTERED SYRIAN REFUGEE IT'S BEEN ROUNDED UP BY TURKISH AUTHORITIES AND RETIRED AND THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT TURKEY HAS TO AVON AMBIGUOUSLY STOP BEFORE ANY RETURN DEAL KENT CAN BECOME OPERATIONAL JOHN DOWN TO SOME FROM AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL PACKS

HOOVES INTERN EMULATED GEORGE CAROLYN AND THAT'S FOR HOW WELL KNOWN THEY ARE OVER HERE ON THE SEAS BUT WERE YOU THAT YOU TEACH POETRY DON'T YOU INCLUDING POETRY FULL STAND UP YES STAND UP AS POETRY BECAUSE POETRY WAS ORIGINALLY AN OR ART FORM AS THE RICHER EVEN BEFORE THE CONCEPT OF THE DATA WAS INVENTED
