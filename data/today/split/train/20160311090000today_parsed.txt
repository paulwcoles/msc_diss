ALSO IN TODAY'S PROGRAMME WE FIND THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM HAS YET TO FIRE THE INTEREST OF MANY YOUNG VOTERS AND THAT'S TO PUT IT MILDLY
WHAT DO YOU FOR SIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT BETTER WE GET WHAT WE GET FROM GOING TO US JOHNNY I DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN THE U.K. YOU KNOW I'M NOT A U. K. IN THE EUROPEAN UNION YEAH NO I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE
AND IS IT TIME FOR THIS ALL RUGBY SONG TO BE SENT OFF FOR AN EARLY BATH AND PLANED WITH JEALOUSY IF YOU GO TO THE DOOR AND SHE LAUGHS THAT
I KNOW NO MOMENT OF PASSION HE NOTICE
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BY ZEB SOAMES THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY AS DESCRIBED AS ABSOLUTELY AND RELIGIOUS ANY MOVES TO CONDEMN AS RACIST PEOPLE WHO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PARLIAMENT'S HOUSE MAGAZINE HE SAID IT WAS REASONABLE TO BE ANXIOUS AT A TIME OF WHAT HE CALLED SUCH COLOSSAL CRISIS IT'S A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT
ASKED ABOUT THE REFUGEE CRISIS JUSTIN WELBY TERMS IT'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE BUT IT CAN ONLY BE HANDLED AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL SAYING THAT THE CURRENT WORK AT THE EUROPEAN SOLUTION WAS DEEPENING THE CRISIS SIGNIFICANTLY HE ALSO SAYS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF THE INFLUX OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS ON THE COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE AND THAT IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS TO CONDEMN THOSE WHO RAY SUCH CONCERNS AS RACIST
ARCHBISHOP GOES ON TO SAY THAT BRITAIN NEEDS TO FIND WAYS OF TAKING ITS SHARE OF REFUGEES AND THAT THE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS REALLY RATHER THIN COMPARED WITH THAT MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE TAKEN BY GERMANY LAST YEAR
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SOUGHT TO HIS RELATIONS WITH THE U.K. AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA CRITICISED BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN A MAGAZINE INTERVIEW MY OBAMA SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD ALLOWED LIBYA TO BECOME A MESS FOLLOWING THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE WHITE HOUSE LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT PRAISING DAVID CAMERON AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN CIRCLE REPORTS
THIS UNSOLICITED STATEMENTS SENT TO ME BY A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN SEEMS TO SHOW THE ADMINISTRATION IN SERIOUS DAMAGE LIMITATION MODE NED PRICE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL PRAISE DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP IN NATO AND ARE MEETING THE COMMITMENT TO SPEND TWO PER CENT OF NATIONAL INCOME ON DEFENCE
IN HIS INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT BLAMED BRITAIN OF FRANCE FOR THE CHAOS THAT NOW REIGNS IN LIBYA AND SHOWED THE FURY FELT IN WASHINGTON THAT BRITAIN HAS IN RECENT YEARS CONSIDERED CUTTING DEFENCE SPENDING
LAST NIGHT DOWNING STREET RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING MY OBAMA HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE CLEAR THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS AMONG HIS CLOSEST PARTNERS
THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN I'VE BEEN REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF THE MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI WHICH KILLED NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXACTLY FIVE YEARS AGO THE TOON ARMY ALSO CRIPPLED OR NUCLEAR PLANT AT FUKUSHIMA WHEN THEY'LL DANCE IN THREE REACTORS SPREAD RADIATION OVER A WIDE AREA OF COUNTRYSIDE CONTAMINATING WATER FOOD AND
THE FRONT RUNNER FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE DONALD TRUMP IS USED TO TELEVISED DEBATE TO REPEATED ASSERTION THAT MUSLIMS HATE THE UNITED STATES THE BUSINESSMAN SAID HE WOULD CONSIDER PUTTING BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY THOUSAND U.S. TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO HELP DEFEAT ISLAMIC STATE HIS MAIN RIVAL THE TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUISE ACCUSED HIM OF PUTTING FORWARD SIMPLISTIC SOLUTIONS TO WORLD PROBLEMS
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL HAS SET A FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD RUN THE ECONOMY WITH IRON DISCIPLINE IS GIVING A SPEECH OUTLINING A NEW FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE WHICH WOULD BIND A FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE DAY TO DAY SPENDING WITH THE MAGIC RAISES IN TAXES IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR THE MARMOT
IT IS A MAJOR ATTEMPT TO REPOSITION THE LABOUR PARTY ON THE ECONOMY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT WING ABOUT EXCESSIVE SPENDING THE FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE WILL OBLIGE ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND WHAT THE PARTY DESCRIBES HER DAY TO DAY SPENDING IT WILL ALLOW FOR BORROWING FOR INVESTMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
SUCH AS NEW ROADS AND RAILWAYS LABOUR SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED TO ME THAT A LACK OF ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE PARTY AT THE LAST ELECTION THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE SAID THAT ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD PUT THE PUBLIC FINANCES AT RISK
A STUDY SAYS PLANTING TREES AROUND RIVERS COULD REDUCE THE HEIGHT OF FLOODING IN TOWNS DOWNSTREAM BUT UP TO TWENTY PER CENT THE RESEARCH CARRIED OUT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY SUGGESTS PLANTING TREES CAN ALSO SLOW DOWN THE RUSH OF RAINWATER AND SAVE PROPERTIES FROM FLOODING

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LOUISE IT'S EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THE PAPERS NUMBER OF THEM ARE LEADING ON THOSE COMMENTS BY BARACK OBAMA ABOUT DAVID CAMERON AND HIS HANDLING OF THE LIBYA CRISIS AT THE INDEPENDENT FROM PAGE HEADLINE OBAMA SAVAGES KAMRAN OVER LIBYA THE WAY THE TIMES PUTS IT IS OBAMA LAYS BLAME FOR LIBYA MESS ON CAMERON THE CRITICAL QUOTES CONTAINED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT IN AN INTERVIEW IN ATLANTIC MAGAZINE
HE CLAIMS THAT MY CAMERA WAS DISTRACTED BY A RANGE OF OTHER THINGS I HAD MORE FAITH IN THE EUROPEANS HE SAYS GIVEN LIBYA'S PROXIMITY BEING INVESTED IN THE FOLLOW UP THE KEY PHRASE PROBABLY NOT REPEATABLE AT THIS TIME IS THAT HE PRIVATELY OR PUBLICLY CALLS LIBERA MESS PRIVATELY CALLS IT A SORT OF SHOW THE BEGINS WITH AN S. AND HAS FOUR LETTERS IN IT THE WAY THE SUN PUTS IT IS BARRACKING OBAMA SLAMS CAM ON LIBYA
THE MALE LEAVES WITH THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY STORY BRITAIN HAS A GENUINE AND JUSTIFIED FEAR OF MASS IMMIGRATION IN THE COUNTRY'S MOST SENIOR JUDGEMENT AS A MALE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS TO DISMISS THE PUBLIC'S LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AS RACIST AND HERE IS HOW THE MALE REACTS TO IT HALLELUJAH
FOR MANY YEARS IT SAYS THAT IS THEIR WORD BY THE WAY NOT MINE HALLELUJAH FOR MANY YEARS THE MALE HAS MADE PRECISELY THE SAME ARGUMENTS IN CONTRAST CHURCH OF ENGLAND BIGWIGS HAVE SNEERED AT LITTLE ENGLANDERS IMPLYING THAT IT IS BIGOTED TO WORRY ABOUT COLLAPSING PUBLIC SERVICES TRULY THE AGE OF MIRACLES IS NOT DEAD
THE GUARDIANS LEADERS AND INTERVIEW THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL IN WHICH HE'S PREVIEWING A SPEECH THAT HE WILL GIVE LATER THIS MORNING PLEDGING IRON DISCIPLINE TO REGAIN THE LABOUR PARTY'S CREDIBILITY ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ECONOMY MY MCDONNELL TELLS THE PAPER THAT IT'S THE STRUGGLE OF HER GENERATION
SOCIALISM IS ABOUT PLANNING HE SAYS AND PLANNING IS ABOUT MAKING SURE EVERY PENNY IS SPENT EFFECTIVELY EVERY PENNY MISSPENT AS BEING TAKE AWAY FROM THE REAL INVESTMENT THAT IS NEEDED HIS BIG IDEA IS TO SIMPLY BORROW TO INVEST RATHER SIMILAR TO A PROMISE THAT GORDON BROWN USED TO MAKE
THE DAILY MIRROR LEADS WITH THE STORY ABOUT DAVID CAMERON'S MOTHER MORE SPECIFICALLY AS A CHILD CARE CENTRE WHERE SHE WORKED IT IS BEING SHUT DOWN THERE SAYS THE MIRROR BY THE TORIES IT MEANS MARY CAMERON'S A VOLUNTEER JOB WILL BE ACCIDENT FAMILY STRIPPED OF VITAL FREE SERVICES MARY SO A MIRROR BEG THE MIRROR FOR HELP SHE SAID I'M VERY SAD ANYTHING YOU CAN DO WILL BE GREAT
IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX THE TRUMP BANDWAGON CONTINUES TO ROLL THE FRONT RUNNER TO BE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY HAS CONFIRMED THAT A MAN WHO WAS UNTIL RECENTLY HIS RIVAL BEN CARSON WILL NOW BACK HIM INSTEAD MY DRUM MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT DURING THE LATEST TELEVISED REPUBLICAN DEBATE IN MIAMI MY CARSON WHO PULLED OUT OF THE RACE LAST WEEK IS THE SECOND A FORMER HOPEFUL TO BACK MISTER TRUMP AFTER THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE
DURING THAT DEBATE MY TRUMP DEFENDED THIS STATEMENT AN INTERVIEW EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT ISLAM HATES AMERICA HE WAS ASKED BY THE MODERATOR YOU'RE GAY RAM US IF HE THOUGHT ALL ONE POINT SIX BILLION MUSLIMS
HATED THE UNITED STATES I MEAN A LOT OF THEM I MEAN
YOU WANT TO CLARIFY THE COMMENT AND ALL WELL YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE DEBATE TODAY AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OR A RADICAL ISLAM BUT I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE MAYBE EURO KNOW ABOUT AND MAYBE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUT THERE'S TREMENDOUS HATRED AND I WILL STICK WITH EXACTLY WHAT I SAY
MY DRUMS OPPONENTS MARCO RUBIO DISAGREED WITH HIM ON THE ISSUE THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND APPEAL NOT THINGS DONAL SAYS COS HE SAYS WHAT PEOPLE WISH THEY COULD SAY THE PROBLEM IS PRESIDENTS CAME TO SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT IT HAS CONSEQUENCES
ALL EYES NOW TURNED TO FLORIDA MARKER RUBIO'S HOME STATE TRUMP WINDS THERE THE RACE MAY FINALLY BE OVER
IT IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX AND IT'S FIVE YEARS TODAY SINCE THAT MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI STRUCK JAPAN AND DESTROYED THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT OF COOKER SHIMMER A CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WINGFIELD HAYES IT IS AND WHAT'S IT LIKE TO TODAY RUPERT
IT'S A VERY SOLEMN DAY TODAY JOHN I'M A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH IN THE TOWN OF RICKY SENT A CUTTER WHICH WAS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT WHEN THAT THAT HUGE WAVE SWEPT IN HERE WHAT ARE MANY TOWNS THEY WERE WIPED OUT AND OF COURSE IT CAUSED THE DISASTER I WAS BACK IN THE THE NEW CLEARED RADIATION EXCLUSION ZONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND IT IS VERY VERY STRANGE AND DATE DEED STILL NOW THERE'S A LITTLE TOWN CALLED ALCHEMILLA WHICH IS ABOUT A MILE FROM THE PLANT AND WALKING DOWN THE STREET THERE THEY WERE
RACCOONS AND MONKEYS LITERALLY WALKING DOWN THE STREET NONCHALANTLY BECAUSE HAVE BEEN NO HUMANS THERE FOR FIVE YEARS AND EVERYTHING IS LEFT TO SORT OF EXACTLY AS IT WAS THERE OLD CARS NEATLY PARKED IN DRIVEWAYS THERE ARE IT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE JUST WENT AWAY YESTERDAY BUT PEOPLE
NOT ABLE TO COME BACK THE RADIATION IS TOO HIGH AND AND THIS IS NO SIGN AT ALL NO NOW WHEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COME BACK THERE'S NO PLAN FOR THEM TO RETURNING TO THOSE TOWNS RIGHT AROUND THE PLANT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND EVERYBODY IS SATISFIED THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT DECISION ARE THEY BECAUSE I ASK BECAUSE WE DONE AN INTERVIEW FOR THIS PROGRAMME WE'RE RUNNING A BIT UP A SEVEN IN WHICH A LEADING RADIATION IX EXPERT TO SAYS THAT IT'S OVERBLOWN AND THE DANGER IS MUCH LESS THAN PEOPLE THINK
DOCTOR GERRY THOMAS YES I KNOW HER WELL AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HER INTO THE EXCLUSION SO SHE CAME WITH ME THE OTHER DAY AND SHE I UNDERSTAND SHE'S VERY MUCH OF THE OPINION THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHOICE TO GO BACK IF THEY WANT TO JAPAN IS REALLY FOLLOWING THE INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES SET BY THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY BODIES WHICH WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS A LEVEL OF RADIATION THAT IS SAFE FOR HUMAN HABITATION AND IF IT'S ABOVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO GO BACK SO JAPAN IS FOLLOWING
THE INTERNATIONAL NORMS BUT RADIATION IS EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL IMAGE IN AN EXTREMELY EMOTIVE SUBJECT AND A DOCTOR THOMAS HIS OPINION THAT ACTUALLY HUMANS CAN LIVE IN MUCH HIGHER BACKGROUND RADIATION ENVIRONMENT
A LOT OF VALIDITY TO IT I MEAN APPARENTLY IF YOU LIVE IN SOME PARTS OF CUP CORNWALL YOU CAN GET EIGHT TIMES THE NORMAL BACKGROUND RADIATION OF PLACES ELSEWHERE IN BRITAIN AND INDEED THERE'S A PLACE IN IRAN WE CAN GET TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND PEOPLE LIVE THERE SO IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT
AND AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ALSO WHEN YOU PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES AND THEIR VILLAGES AND THEIR TOWNS AND THEY CAN'T GO BACK MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE FREEDOM TO DO SO IF THEY WANT TO RUPERT MANY THANKS AS WE WILL BE HEARING THAT INTERVIEW HOPPER
IT IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS THROWN THE KITCHEN SINK AT THE EUROZONE ECONOMY BUT MATTHEW PRICE IS HERE TO TELL US WHETHER IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY RESTORE GRACE ON THE CONTINENT I THINK NICK IT MIGHT HAVE THROWN THE WHOLE KITCHENETTE ABILITY IF YOU THINK THIS IS A REPEAT OF A STORY YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT CENTRAL BANKS AS WE KNOW HAVE BEEN PUMPING MORE MONEY INTO ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD FOR SOME TIME NOW BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING AND NO ONE REALLY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE ALL THIS IS LEADING
EACH OF THE E. C. B. MEASURES ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY ARE DESIGNED TO GET PEOPLE SPENDING AGAIN WHY WELL IN ORDER TO GET THE EUROZONE ECONOMY TO PICK UP TO DO THAT THE BANK ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE CUT INTEREST RATES EVEN LOWER THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE PUMPING EVEN MORE MONEY INTO THE ECONOMY AND EXTRA TWENTY BILLION EUROS A MONTH AND THAT IN EFFECT THEY GOING TO PAY EUROPEAN BANKS TO LEND TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS THIS IS HOW THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE SEA BE PRESIDENT MARIO DRUGGIE SUMMED IT ALL UP
IT'S A FAIRLY LONG LEAST MEASURES EACH ONE OF THEM IS VERY SIGNIFICANT
ENDIVE DEVISED TO HAVE THE MAXIMUM IMPACT INTO BOOSTING THE ECONOMY AND THEIR RETURN TO PRICE STABILITY SO WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE ARE NOT SHORT OF AMMUNITIONS WELL THE RESPONSE TO THAT THE VALUE OF THE EURO SANK THAT WAS GOOD NEWS FOR EXPORTERS BANK STOCKS JUMPED FINANCIAL MARKETS OVERALL ROSE BUT THEN DRUGGIE SAID THIS RAIDS WILL STAYING LORNE VERY LOW FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REDUCE RATES FURTHER
AND THE MARKET'S WELL THEY ALL THEN WENT IN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION NIALL TWAIN IS THAT GLOBAL STRATEGIST AT ALI WANTS GLOBAL INVESTORS MEAL WE LOOK AT MARKET NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE INVESTORS FEEL ECONOMIES ARE MOVING AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE REACTION YESTERDAY THE ANSWER IS STILL SIMPLY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
YES UM AND I THINK THAT THE POLICY YESTERDAY WAS BETTER THAN THE MARKETS HAD EXPECTED BUT I THINK THE COMMENT THAT HE THINKS HE'S NOW DONE ENOUGH LEAD THE MARKETS TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE NO MORE
FREE MONEY FOR THEM TO SPECULATE WITH THEM THEREFORE PEOPLE WITH THEREFORE CONCERNED THAT WE'VE SEEN ALL IT TAKES IS NOW COMING TO AN END AND SO THE MARKETS WERE STARTED STARTED TO RE PRICE I THINK THE INTERESTING CHALLENGE IS THAT WE THINK YOU HIS OWN ECONOMIES CURRENTLY DOING O.K. SO IT REALLY DOESN'T NEED THE SUPER STIMULUS AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME BUT MARIO DRUGGIE HAD GOT HIMSELF INTO A INTO A POSITION WHERE HE HAD TO TO TO TO SURPRISE THE MARKETS I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOU THINK THE EUROZONE ECONOMIES DOING O.K.
INFLATION WELL IT'S ESSENTIALLY DEE'S DEFLATION OF THE MACK MARRY A DRUGGIE SAYS WE SHOULDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT IT'S MINUS NOUGHT POINT TWO PER CENT THERE ARE BOUNCED THAT'S NOT GOOD IS IT NO BUT I THINK POLITICIANS AND CENTRAL BANKERS ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON GROWTH AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE THAT THE EUROZONE ECONOMY IN GENERAL IS GOING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND ONE AND A HALF PER CENT
THAT'S A BETTER NUMBER THAN MANY PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING SAY A YEAR AGO AND I THINK THE INFLATION NUMBER IS DISTORTED TO SOME EXTENT BY RECORD LOW FOOD PRICES AND OBVIOUSLY THE VERY LOW OIL PRICE AS THAT POTENTIALLY ROLLS OUT IN THAT IN THE NEXT THREE TO SIX MONTHS ONE COULD SEE INFLATION MORE REASSURINGLY HIGHER BUT WHETHER YOU AND I GET A WAGE RISE TO TO FEEL THAT WE'RE MORE REASSURINGLY BETTER PAID I THINK HE'S STILL A MOOT POINT FOUR
FORM FOR MANY COMPANIES AND MANY CONSUMERS LET'S BRING IN SOON AFTER YOU U.K. EQUITIES FUND MANAGER AT SCHROEDER'S WOULD YOU SHARE THAT SAME ROSY PICTURE OF THE EUROZONE ECONOMY NO PROBABLY NOT THEN THE EUROZONE IS STRUGGLING AND I GRANTED WHERE WE'RE SLIGHTLY LESS NEGATIVE TODAY THE THAN PEOPLE FEARED A YEAR AGO BUT THE NEWS IS NOT GOOD
IT'S TRYING TO TO GET ENOUGH STIMULUS IN ENOUGH CONFIDENCE FROM BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS TO TAKE ON MORE BORROWING IS PROVING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE
GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE MONEY OR SAY THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND THE BANKS AREN'T REALLY HANDING OUT MONEY AND YOU'VE GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY BILLIONS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN COMPANIES
YOUR CLIENT'S BASICALLY WHY AREN'T THEY SPENDING COS OF THE FIGURES ARE SHOWING THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO SPEND LESS THIS YEAR THAN THEY DID LAST YEAR WHY AREN'T COMPANIES PUMPING MONEY I THINK IT'S TWO REASONS THE FIRST ONE IS CONFIDENCE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FEELING UNCERTAIN ABOUT LIFE AND MOST PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
THE SECOND ONE IS PEOPLE'S ANTICIPATED RETURNS
THE ANTICIPATED RETURN IS NOT AS ATTRACTIVE TODAY END INTO THE FUTURE IS PEOPLE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN USED TO AND I THINK THAT IS INHIBITING THAT THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS A NAIL THAT I MEAN THE POTENTIAL RETURNS GOT WORSE YESTERDAY
YES THEY DID I MEAN I THINK THE NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE POLICY IS REALLY TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR MONEY OUT OF CASH AND DO SOMETHING DO SOMETHING WITH IT IS BUT IT'S MAKING HARDER FOR THE BANKS TO LEND ITS IT'S REDUCING THE BANKS' ABILITY TO LENT IT IS BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE PARTS OF THE PROGRAMME WAS THIS NEGATIVE TARGET LENDING SCHEME
WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE OR EFFECTIVELY SUBSIDISE THE BANK'S MARGINS TO ACTUALLY LEND TO NEW PEOPLE LET'S EXPLAIN THAT IN ESSENCE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IS SAYING WE WILL GIVE YOU MONEY AND WE WILL ALSO DO IT AT THE RATE THAT WE'VE SET FOR OVERNIGHT
THAT'S RIGHT OVERNIGHT DEPOSIT SO NO POINT FOUR PER CENT SO YOU THE BANK YOU GET A LOAD OF CASH AS LONG AS YOU HAND IT OUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GIVE YOU AN OAR POINT FOUR PERCENT RATE ON THAT MONEY SO THEY MAKE MONEY BEFORE THEY EVEN LEND IT OUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO LENT OUT TO GET TO THAT OF COURSE I THE MINUS POINT FOR BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING FROM A EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS DIFFERENT SAY IN THE U.K. AND THE U.S. IS THAT SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY PERCENT OF CREDIT IN EUROPE IT'S COME THROUGH THE BANKING SYSTEM
SO IF THE BANKS AREN'T EITHER WILLING TO LEND OR ABLE TO LEND THEN THE CREDIT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T ENTER THAT ENTER THE ECONOMY SO YOU WANT AMMUNITION DOES THAT HE SEE B. HAVE LEFT I MEAN MARRY A DRUGGIE SAID THERE WE HEARD HIM WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF AMMUNITION DOES HE HAVE ANY LEFT
I THINK CIRCUMSTANCES WILL DICTATE WHAT AMMUNITION GETS FOUND IT IN THE CUPBOARD OR WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A NEW CUPBOARD AND WHAT WHAT IS LEFT BECOMES MORE AND MORE UNCONVENTIONAL WE WE THINK WE'RE PUSHING UP AGAINST THE BOUNDARIES OF
LIMITS IN TERMS OF PAYING BANKS TO TO LEN THERE ARE OTHER UNCONVENTIONAL MEASURES THE DRUGGIE COULD TAKE THEY COULD EXTEND THAT THE TITLE IT'S UNCONVENTIONAL MEASURES MAKE PEOPLE NERVOUS AND REDUCED CONFIDENTLY INDEED YEAH SO YOU COME UP AGAINST BARRIERS
AT THE CURRENT TIME I THINK DRUGGIE IS RIGHT SO FOR FOR NOW THOUGH EXPECTS THESE MEASURES TO TO PRODUCE THE RESULTS THAT THEY INTEND
BUT THE WORLD IS FULL OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND EVENTS THAT UNPREDICTABLE NOW SHOULD SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE A NEGATIVE HAPPENED TO TO THE GLOBAL AND EUROPEAN ECONOMIES
THERE ARE PROBABLY MEASURES THAT THEY CAN TAKE THAT THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO DISCUSS FULLY AT THE CURRENT TIME
O. KAY WE WILL DOUBTLESS SEE NEIL AND SUE THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FROM NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES THEN ARE A WORLD AWAY WITH YOUR BUSINESS MODEL AREN'T WE LET'S BRING IN FRIDAY'S BOSS LEO MCKEE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BRIGHT HOUSE THE U.K.'S BIGGEST RENT TO OWN COMPANY HOW DOES YOUR BUSINESS MODEL WORK
THE MODELS QUITE STRAIGHTFORWARD WE PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THEIR POPULATION OF THIRTEEN MILLION ADULTS IN BRITAIN WHO DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE BANKS
WE OFFER WE OFFER WHAT WE CALL I WENT TO AAU AND ARRANGEMENT WE HAD BY THE CUSTOMER PEAS FOR THE PRODUCT OVER SIX MONTHS TO THREE YEARS IN AFFORDABLE INSTALLMENTS
AND THE PRODUCT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT SORT OF RATE YOU TALK HIM OUT OF A STANDARD INTERESTING IT WOULD BE SIXTEEN POINT NINE PER CENT SIXTY NINE POINT NINE YES THAT'S QUITE HIGH WE'RE JUST BE TALKING ABOUT VERY PERRY LOW INTEREST RATES NEGATIVE RATES IN IN PLACES
I THINK IF I AM SERVING THE ALTERNATIVE CREDIT MARKET AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS YOU WILL FIND MOST LENDERS OFFERING A FEW FIGURE PERCENTAGE INTEREST
AND THAT THAT IS NO SECURITY BEHIND THE MONEY WHICH WE ARE PUTTING OUT TWO RIGHT SO YOU'RE TALKING THERE ABOUT PAYDAY LENDERS WHO WE ARE THAT'S BEEN AWFUL AWFUL TERRIBLE PUBLICITY AND CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY SIXTY NINE POINT WELL I'M NOT ALL THAT WITH AND THAT I MEAN WHO WHAT WHO WERE WHO WERE YOU TALKING OUT THERE WHO ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET ACCESS TO BANK LOANS FOR INSTANCE
WELL THERE THEY ARE AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SPECTRUM THEY WILL HAVE A FUN HOUSEHOLD INCOME BUT SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW NOT ONLY THE AVERAGE FOR U.K. HOUSEHOLD BUT THE AVERAGE THAT THE AVERAGE WAGE IN BRITAIN SO THE MIDDLE OF A TOTAL WHO'S INCOME PERHAPS OF TWENTY THOUSAND SO SHOULD THEY BE BORROWING AT SIXTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT
WELL IT'S I THINK ONE HAS TO LOOK AT WHAT THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS IN PRACTICE IS THAT THE CUSTOMER CAN COME INTO PLAY AT HOST POTS POTS JUST A WASHING MACHINE
FOR ABOUT AND A SUBSTANTIAL WASHING MACHINE BY A LEADING BRAND SUCH AS WHAT POINT FOR EXAMPLE FOR THAT WASHING MACHINE THE CUSTOMER WILL P. FIVE PLANES FIFTY PER WEEK
THE CUSTOMER GETS CERTAINTY IN THE SENSE THAT IF THERE'S ANY DIFFICULTY WITH THAT WASHING MACHINE I EMPLOYED A CADRE OF CLEANED ENGINEERS WHO WILL BE IN THE CUSTOMER SHOWS THE NEXT DAY AND ORDER TED APPEARED AT THE FOOD YOU CAN'T REPEALED IT MUSIC POLICE SO I SUPPOSE YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT FIVE PENCE FIFTY A WEEK IS
CHEAPER PROBABLY THAN THEM GOING TO THE LAUNDRETTE CORRECT CLAIRE THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE THE LAUNDERETTE FOR FOR THAT CUSTOMER THERE CAN I PUT TO YOU SO WE LOOKED UP ON YOUR WEBSITE IF YOU IF YOU WENT INTO BY TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE INCH APPLE I'M A COMPUTER ON SALE YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR WEBSITE FOR BASICALLY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OVER ONE HUNDRED FOUR WEEKS AT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED PERCENT A.P.R.
THE ACTUAL PRODUCT PRICES AT NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE POUNDS SO YOU'RE LENDING OF THE MONEY IS DEEMED BY USED TO BE A MORE EXPENSIVE SERVICE THAN APPLES MAKING OF THE COMPUTER IN THE FIRST PLACE
WELL I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS FIRST OF ALL IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PRODUCT PRICES WE WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT ORGANISATION LOOKS AT OUR PRODUCT RACES EVERY WEEK AND COMPARED THEM AGAINST THE HIGH STREET'S A FUEL TO COME IN AND BUY A PRODUCT OR A PRODUCT OR A PRODUCT PRICES COMPETITIVE AGAINST I SEE THAT I CAN ASSURE YOU
IN TERMS OF I THINK WHAT ONE HAS TO IT IT WAS ALL THERE CAN'T THE NATURE OF THIS OUT OF US IT'S NOT ONLY A SERVICE WE HAVE BUY THEM YOU BUY THE PRODUCT IT'S A NO QUIBBLE
IF BUT WHAT WITH THE MOST THE MOST COMMON REASON FRONT FOR A PRODUCT NOT OPERATING
HIS USE OF DAMAGE THAT'S THE MOST COMMON REASON WE HAVE A NO QUIBBLE GUARANTEE SO THERE'S A SERVICE THERE YOU'RE PROVIDING CAN US JUST IN THE NAME OF BRIE FEW SECONDS WE'VE GOT LEFT AND YOU DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO YOU
DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE IN ARE THEY DO THEY UNDERSTAND BETTER THE DANGERS OF GETTING INTO DEBT THAN PERHAPS WE DID BACK IN SIX OH SEVEN BEFORE THE CRASH WELL I'M GLAD YOU ASKED ME THAT QUESTION BECAUSE BECAUSE PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF THE SPECTRUM DOESN'T MEAN THE RESPONSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO ME ARE VERY OFTEN SAVVY SHAWCROSS
IF MY AVERAGE COS THE MAN IS A THIRTY FIVE GOOD OLD MOODY WITH TWO CHILDREN SHE REALLY THINKS THE OR BUDGET AND WHAT SHE CAN AFFORD AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PEE PEE WEEKLY WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AT ALL AND ENJOY THEIR PRODUCT AND RECOMMEND THE FRIEND LIAM A KING FROM BRIGHT HOUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST A QUICK TRAIL AHEAD IN AN HOUR WE'VE GOT THE ACTING HEAD OF THE B.

ABOUT THE ATLANTIC ARTICLE BEFORE WE PUT IN THE USUAL CALLS A FEW JOURNALISTS IN A WASHINGTON NEWSROOM RECEIVED UNSOLICITED AN EMAIL FROM THEIR PRICES A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRIME MINISTER CAMERON HAS BEEN AS CLOSE A PARTNER AS THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD AND WE DEEPLY VALUED THE U.K.'S CONTRIBUTIONS ON A SHARED NATIONAL SECURITY
WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA THE PRESIDENT HAS LONG SAID THAT ALL OF US INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COULD HAVE DONE MORE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE LIBYAN INTERVENTION THEN CAME EVEN MORE DIPLOMATIC DAMAGE CONTROL MORE BROADLY THE U.K. HAS STEPPED UP ON A RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP WHEN NATO IN TERMS OF MEETING THE TWO PER CENT COMMITMENT THE TWO PER CENT COMMITMENT REFERS TO THIS TWO PER CENT OF G.D.P. THAT NATO COUNTRIES ARE SUPPOSED TO SPEND
ON DEFENCE THEY PROTEST A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY DON'T KNOW IT IS CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IN PRIVATE IS DEEPLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE WAY THE EUROPEANS TEMPTED HIM INTO LIBYA AND THEN LEFT IT AS HE DESCRIBED IT AND WORD WE PROBABLY WON'T REPEAT AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING THAT'S RIGHT VERY STRONG LANGUAGE ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE BY GEOFFREY GOAL BUT HE SAYS THAT HE HAD MORE FAITH IN HIS EUROPEAN PARTNERS TO HANDLE THE AFTERMATH
OF THE LIBYA INTERVENTION WHICH BEGAN OF COURSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND HE SAYS THAT DAVID CAMEL WAS DISTRACTED BY A RANGE OF OTHER THINGS AND ALSO THAT NICOLAS SARKOZY TOOK HIS EYES OFF THE BALL
AS WELL THE IDEA THAT THE POST THE BOMBING WHICH WAS BRIEFLY SEEM TO BE RATHER SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING THE REBELS THE COUNTRY WAS ALLOWED A EFFECTIVELY TO GIVE THEIR DOGS ABSOLUTE CHAOS IN THE CHAOS THAT IS STILL BEING SEEN THERE NOW IN THE CHAOS WHICH
THE GROUP CALLING ITSELF ISIS HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS SET UP A HAVEN IN LIBYA FROM WHICH IT CAN CARRY OUT ATTACKS THE PROBLEM WITH ALL THIS DAMAGE CONTROL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ESPECIALLY IS THAT IT MASKS A COUPLE OF OTHER STRESS POINTS IN THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP IT SAYS THAT BRITAIN HAS STEPPED UP ON DEFENCE SPENDING AND THAT IT TAKES
BLAME AS PART OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED TO LIBYA BUT THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS AS WELL I MEAN IN RECENT YEARS THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN AGGRIEVED BY THE CAMERA GOVERNMENTS ASIAN PIVOT TOWARDS CHINA FOR THE AMERICANS IT SMACKS A BRITAIN HEDGING HIS BETS OVER WHICH COUNTRY WILL AND THIS CENTURY THE DOMINANT GLOBAL PERHAPS ANOTHER THING I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BY SEEING A FORMER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL IS THAT THE MINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED THAT IT'S REQUEST FOR OPERATIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES INCLUDING THE S.A.S. OR NOT GRANTED WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY
THAT THEY WERE IN THE PAST AND AGAIN IT'S THIS CRITICISM THAT THE U.K. IS NO LONGER PUNCHING ITS WAY NICK BRYANT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SERVE ON THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY HAS SAID BRITAIN'S FEAR OF MASS IMMIGRATION IS GENUINE AND JUSTIFIED AND IT'S OUTRAGEOUS TO DISMISS THEIR PEERS AS RACIST OR RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT THIS CAROLINE WYATT THIS IS STRONG STUFF FROM THE ARCHBISHOP CAROL
MAUDE TO HELP REFUGEES BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD YOU CALL BEFORE THEY HAD PEOPLE HAPPY WOULD BE A VALUED THESE ARE LEGITIMATE FEARS AND WE NEED HELP
BLACK BUT ON BACK HE'S TREADING A VERY MUCH MORE ALL LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE THAT WHAT YOU WANT IS A GOOD TAPE IT WOULD BE A SHIMMERING DEBATE BUT LOOK EXACTLY WHAT BRITAIN WOULD BE LIKE IF HE GOES WHAT HE COULD DO WITH WORK THEN WHAT A GOOD GROUP TRAINED EUROPE BUT EQUALLY WHAT BRITAIN WOULD LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE I HAD WHAT'S THE DANGER THE TODD IMMIGRATION HE WILL BE PAINTED AS ANTI IMMIGRATION

THANKS A LOT IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN TONY BLAIR HAS JOINED THE FRAY ON EUROPE TELLING THIS PROGRAMME THAT IT'S TIME THAT PRO E.U. CAMPAIGNERS SHOULD SOME OF THE FERVOUR OF THEIR OPPONENTS THIS ON THE DAY THAT LABOUR'S SHADOW CHANCELLOR IS TRYING TO RESTORE THE PARTY'S REPUTATION FOR PRUDENCE UP LITTLE CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON JOINS US ON THE LINE MORNING TO YOU
MORNING NICK TONY BLAIR FIRST OF ALL HE'S NOT RUSHING TO JOIN THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THERE DESPITE THESE WORDS IS IT NO IT ISN'T YOU'LL BE WELL AWARE OF THE THE INTERVIEWERS ATTRIBUTED IT BUT NO HE'S NOT I MEAN I THOUGHT WAS AN INTERESTING THE INTERVIEW WAS THAT
ADMITTED THAT GIVEN HIS BAGGAGE SHE MAY NOT BE THE MAN REALLY TO LEAD THE ENCAMP IN SOME QUARTERS HE WOULD BE A LIABILITY NOT AN ASSET AS HE PUT IT THE NEGATIVES AS WELL AS POSITIVES ABOUT HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE OFFICE IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT HE WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY ONLY ONE THE SHILOH MAIN PRIZE HAVE BEEN A GOOD EUROPEAN IN HIS FIRST TERM IN OFFICE HE QUITE FINDS HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL WHEN HE LEFT OFFICE BUT I THINK WHAT WAS ALSO INTERESTING ABOUT THE INTERVIEW
YOU WAS THERE WAS SOME COMMENTS IN THE TOOL AND NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN HE NEED TO BE MORE PASSIONATE THE SENSE OF BRITAIN HAD BENEFITED ENORMOUSLY FROM MEMBERSHIP THE FACT BRITAIN COULD LEADS IN EUROPE RATHER THAN BE ON THE PERIPHERY AND I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPLICIT NOT THAT CLOSE ACTUALLY CRITICISM PERHAPS THE THE CURRENT TONE OF THE INCOME PAYING THE BALANCE AND IT'S BEEN TIPPED TOO MUCH TOWARDS THE DIRE WARNINGS THE PROJECT FEAR END OF THE SCALE AND PERHAPS THAT NEEDS TO BE TEMPERED
HE'S RATHER DEFIANT ABOUT THE ELITES BEING ON BOTH SIDES AS WELL YOU CAN HEAR THAT INTERVIEW INCIDENTALLY AT ABOUT TEN TO EIGHT THIS MORNING LET'S MOVE ON TO JOHN MCDONNELL THOUGH THIS BIG SPEECH IT DESCRIBED AS SUCH BY THE LABOUR PARTY BY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR AHEAD OF THE BUDGET WHAT'S THE BIG MESSAGE
I THINK THIS INTEREST JOHN MACDONALD OF COURSE WAS THE MAN WHO REBELLED AGAINST TONY BLAIR MORE THAN ANY OTHER M. P. INCLUDING JEREMY CORBIN AND HE'S NO TALKING THIS BIG SPEECH ABOUT AND I ARE IN DISCIPLINE AND PUBLIC FINANCES SOUNDS VERY BROKEN EIGHT IF NOT EIGHT DOESN'T IT YOU REMEMBER NICK OF COURSE HE WAS A BOAT TO SAIL UP TO GEORGE OSBORNE'S FISCAL CHANCERY NO START AT THE CONFERENCE LAST YEAR HAVE YOU THEN FIST SOME REBELLION FROM HIS OWN M.P.S
AND ALSO BECAME CLEAR THAT THAT PHYSICAL CHARTER RESTRICT RESTRICT INVESTMENT SPENDING SO TWO WEEKS LATER HE DID A U. TURN HE'S NO COMPACT WITH HIS NEW POLICY AHEAD OF THE LOCAL ELECTIONS IS FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE AND THAT WOULDA LOW BORROWING TO INVEST BUT IT WOULD SEEK TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND EVERY DAY SPENDING HAVE GOT EVERY DAY REVENUE SPENDING ALSO FOR EXAMPLE THE PUBLIC SECTOR PAY BILLS I THINK SOME OF HIS FELLOW ANTI AUSTERITY CAMPAIGNERS
WATCHING CLOSELY ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IN PRACTICE BUT CLEARLY HE'S LOOKING AT THE POLES THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM WITH LABOUR'S ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY HE'S TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT THE POSES NO ACTUALLY NOT THAT FAR AWAY FROM WHERE IT WASN'T ED MILIBAND AND ED BALLS BUT I THINK IT WOULD'VE WARNING FOR JOHN MCDONNELL THERE THAT IN ITSELF WASN'T ENOUGH TO GET LABOUR ELECTED FAR FROM IT KNOW WATSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S A SEVENTY EIGHTY MINUTES TO SEVEN LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND EVEN THE MATHEMATICALLY LITERATE MAY STRUGGLE TO GRASP THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK TO CUT ONE OF ITS INTEREST RATES TO NOTHING WHILE MOVING THE DEPOSIT RATE INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY THERE'S A CARTOON OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES THE TRIES TO CAPTURE THE SENSE OF BAFFLEMENT A CUSTOMER APPLYING FOR A LOAN WAITS IN HER FINANCES OFFICE THE BANKER CONCENTRATE ON HIS CALCULATOR AND SAYS
LET ME JUST CHECK WHAT ZERO PER CENT OF ZERO IS THE TELEGRAPH DESCRIBES THE ACTIONS OF THE EASY B. HE'S EMBARKED ON A STRONG MEDICINE BITS BREAK THE BANK IS RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS THE INDEPENDENT WONDERS WHETHER IT SALVO OF MEASURES WON'T JUST LEAD TO MORE TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS THE GUARDIAN'S HE'S GROWING CONCERNS HAVE AN ECONOMIC CRASH THE TIMES JUDGES THAT THE BEE HAS CHOSEN THE RIGHT CAUSE BUT THINKS THE PLIGHT OF THE EUROZONE HAS EXPOSED THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY
AS MISCONCEIVED THE HEAD OF THE C.B. HAS BROKEN NEW GROUND SAYS THE F.T. BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL SUCCEED GEORGE OSBORNE WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO SEIZE THE INITIATIVE WHEN HE DELIVERS HIS BUDGET NEXT WEEK JEREMY WARNER IN THE TELEGRAPH SUGGESTS THAT THE E.U. REFERENDUM HAS TURNED THE OCCASION INTO AN EXERCISE IN PRE ELECTION SHOWMANSHIP HE EXPECTS THE CHANCELLOR TO PROMISE GOODIES TO COME SO LONG AS VOTERS CHOOSE TO STAY
EVEN BETTER THE CONSERVATIVE DRIVE FOR AUSTERITY HAS RESULTED IN DAVID CAMERON'S MOTHER LOSING HER JOB WITH THE PAPER BLAMES CUTS FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE CHILDREN'S CENTRE IN BERKSHIRE WHERE MISS THIS IS CAMERON MARY COME AND SPENDS SEVERAL HOURS A WEEK AS A VOLUNTEER SAYS THE MIRROR STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH HER AS SHE FIGHTS TO SAVE HER JOB AND IT ACCUSES AUSTERITY POLICIES OF CUTTING PUBLIC SERVICES TO THE BONE A SENSE OF SURPRISE IS SHARED BY MOST OF THE PAPERS HAVE THE REPORT THOSE VIEWS OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THAT IN THE WORDS OF THE DAILY MAIL HEADLINE
IT ISN'T RACIST TO FEAR IMMIGRATION THE SUN CALLS THAT'S A MARKED SHIFT OF TONE ARE YOU TURN SAYS THE MALE WHICH COMMENT HALLELUJAH BELIEVING THAT JUSTIN WELBY HAS EXPERIENCED A DRAMATIC CONVERSION AND THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS FEARING FOR OUR CULTURE PUBLIC SERVICES AND JOB PROSPECTS IN THE FACE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF NEW ARRIVALS HE'S JUST
COMMON SENSE AND THE SUN IS INTERESTED DOES HE PUT IT IN THE LENGTHS THAT SOME WILL GO TO TO AVOID ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM TO STORY ABOUT STUDENTS IN CAMBRIDGE CANCELLING A FANCY DRESS PARTY IN CASE IT LED TO ACCUSATIONS OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION
THE TELEGRAPH HAS A PHOTO OF THE AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS EVENTS THREE YEARS AGO COUPLE OF STUDENTS DRESSED AS PEASANTS THE TIMER'S AMONG OTHERS REPORTS OF SOME FEEL THAT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HAS BEEN TAKEN TOO FAR THE MALE OFFERS AN ACCOUNT OF AN ACADEMIC STUDY CARRIED OUT TO DETERMINE WHICH THE COUNTRY
WITH THE MOST HONEST POPULATION AND WHICH THE LEAST THE RESEARCHERS IN NOTTINGHAM AND THE U.S. PUT LITHUANIA IN FIRST PLACE WITH BRITAIN SECOND THAT INVITE ANY BLATANT LYING BUT THE COUNTRY'S MOST LIKELY TO BEND THE TRUTH WHERE ACCORDING TO THEM CHINA TURKEY AND THEY LAST PLACE POLAND
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO SEVEN THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HAS SAID IT IS NOT A RACIST TO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION AT A TIME OF COLOSSAL CRISIS ACROSS EUROPE THE EUROPEAN UNION STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THAT MIGRATION CRISIS IS FLAWED AND DOOMED TO FAILURE OR HOUSE OF LORDS COMMITTEE WAS TOLD YESTERDAY
WHILE IN THE COMMONS THE SPEAKER TOLD M.P.S NOT TO DISCUSS THE QUEEN'S VIEWS ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HE REPORTS ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT
THIS IS A BUSY TIME FOR CABINET MINISTERS WHO WANT THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL AS CAMPAIGNING FOR AN OAK VOTE IN THE REFERENDUM THEY STILL NEED TO FIT IN THEIR DAY JOB AND SO CHRIS GRAYLING THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS WHO GAVE A SPEECH YESTERDAY MORNING IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING THE Y. YOU COULDN'T HANG AROUND AFTERWARDS FOR COFFEE AND BISCUITS BUT HAD TO HURRY OFF FOR HIS REGULAR THURSDAY MORNING APPEARANCE IN THE COMMONS
HIS LABOUR OPPOSITE NUMBER OR CHRIS BRYANT DIDN'T EVEN REALISE MISTER GREYLING HAD BEEN UP AND DOING SO EARLY OR POSSIBLY HIS ASSISTANTS EITHER
SEE THAT HIS SPECIAL ADVISERS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN BRIEFING THE PAPERS ON THIS SPEECH AND WON'T BE ATTENDING HIS SPEECH AND AS THE CABINET SECRETARY HAS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED THAT SPECIAL ADVISERS MAY NOT DO SO DURING OFFICE
IS THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE BEING FORCED TO MAKE THE SPEECH UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T SEEM UPSET CHRIS GRAYLING FELT MISTER BRYANT WASN'T REALLY ATTENDING TO HIS SPEECH
HAVE YOU ASKED ABOUT THE SPEED I'M GOING TO BE GIVING TODAY WHAT YOU MISSED IS THAT I'VE ALREADY GIVEN IT
I'M NOT AFTER THIS
BUT CHRIS BRYANT ALSO SEIZED ON THE ROW OVER THE SUN NEWSPAPER WHICH CLAIMED THAT THE QUEEN BACK LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS COMPLAINED TO THE PRESS WATCHDOG WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT THE BRECHT'S IT CAMPAIGN AND I WAS SO DESPERATE THAT THEY'RE EVEN TRYING TO RECRUIT MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY TO THEIR CAUSE
SO I SAY LAY OFF THE QUEEN AND THINK AGAIN
CHRIS GRAYLING DID ANNOUNCE AT THE MONARCH HERSELF WILL BE IN PARLIAMENT ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF MAY TO OPEN THE NEW SESSION OF PARLIAMENT AND ANNOUNCED THE GOVERNMENT'S LATEST PROGRAMME OF PLANNED NEW LAWS BUT HE MADE NO REFERENCE TO THE QUEEN'S REPORTED COMMENTS AND SON ABOUT EUROPE AFTER ALL THE PRIME MINISTER HIMSELF HAD TO APOLOGISE TO HER WHEN HE WAS OVERHEARD SAYING THAT SHE'D HEARD DOWN THE PHONE WHEN HE TOLD AS THE RESULTS OF THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM SOMETHING THAT STILL FRESH IN THE MIND OF THE S.N.P. PETE WISHER
BECAUSE SHE OFFERED TO USE FOR THOUGH HER MAJESTY QUEEN AS A BREAKFAST
IT WOULD GET SO WE SHOULD HAVE A HOME IT'S RIGHT IN THE STOP OF THIS VICAR PERHAPS WAS PIPES TO PRIME MINISTER
AND DIRECT WE WON POWER FOR N. TWO UP FOR ANTS ARE THAT WE WILL BE TOLD
ACTUALLY THAT BROUGHT MY SPEAKER TO HIS FEET HE SAID WHAT HE SAID BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HOUSE IN PARTICULAR FOR THE BENEFIT OF NEW MEMBERS CAN I JUST UNDERLINE WE DON'T DISCUSS THEIR VIEWS OF THE MONARCH
IN THIS NOW AS A BACKDROP TO THE U.K.'S IN OUT REFERENDUM THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GRAPPLING WITH HOW TO COPE WITH THE MIGRANT CRISIS BUT IN A STARK WARNING A COMMITTEE OF PIERCE WAS TOLD THAT THE E. USE APPROACH WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE THEY WERE HEARING FROM PETER ROBERTS OF THE DEFENCE AND SECURITY THINK TANK RECEIPT
DURING HIS TWENTY SIX YEARS AS A ROYAL NAVY OFFICER HE'D WORKED ON MIGRATION AND ANTI SMUGGLING OPERATIONS WITH THE U.S. NAVY AND HE WAS CONVINCED THE Y. YOU WAS ON A VERY WRONG TRACK AWAY THEY'VE CONSTRUCTED THEIR MILITARY APPROACH TO THE MIGRATION
HE'S FLAWED AND DOOMS THE STRATEGY THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED TO FAILURE IN THE SHORT TERM
WITH MUCH MORE SERIOUS LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONTINENT SO IT'S A PRETTY INTRACTABLE PROBLEM WELL MAYBE NOT
THERE ARE SOME VERY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO REDUCING THE NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING BY SEA AND WHAT ARE THOSE WELL HE SUGGESTED ONLY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BID TO SETTLE IN EUROPE BEFORE THEY TRAVELLED INSTEAD OF PEOPLE COMING INTO MAINLAND EUROPE
TO MAKE THEIR BID FOR STATUS THAT THEY DO IT IN TURKEY OR JORDAN OR ANY OF THE OTHER DEPARTURE POINTS THE MISTAKE PETER ROBERTS WAS GIVING PEOPLE A REASON TO COME TO EUROPE FIRST WHAT WE'VE DONE CURRENTLY WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM MAINLAND EUROPE IS TO SAY EVERYONE COME ACROSS HIM AND PROCESS THEM ONCE YOU'VE
NOW THE PUTTING UP OF BORDERS THE SEA PATROLS BEFOREHAND REALLY CAN'T OVERCOME ONCE PEOPLE HAVE ARRIVED WHERE THEY DON'T WORK AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
AFTER ALL HE SAID IT WASN'T FEASIBLE TO RELY ON LOCAL COASTGUARDS PARTICULARLY IN TROUBLED COUNTRIES TO STOP THOSE OVERCROWDED BUILT SETTING SAIL TAKE LIBYA
THE CAPTAIN OF THE ONLY VESSEL COASTGUARD VESSEL LIVING COASTGUARD VESSEL OR OPERAS HAD A TRIPOLI IS A FISHERMAN WHO WHO OWNS A RESTAURANT WHICH IS MANGE
PETER ROBERTS ON A LIBYAN COAST GUARD WITH MANY TALENTS
SUSAN YOU AND REPORT IN YOU CAN HEAR MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT ON LONG WAVE OR ON DIGITAL AND HOPPER STATE
NOW TEN TO SEVEN COULD PLANTING TREES LOTS AND LOTS MORE TREES BE PART OF THE ANSWER TO THE FLOODING PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS THAT IT IS THE FINDING OF NEW RESEARCH THE MAN HE'S BEEN CARRYING IT OUT IS DOCTOR SIMON DIXON WHO JOINS US FROM BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE OF FOREST RESEARCH MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR DIXON GOING TO BEGIN WITH A DEAF LADDIE QUESTION
WHAT DO THE TREES DO YOU HOW DO THEY HELP REDUCE THE FLOODING RISK BEHIND MORNING YEAH WITH THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT WHEN RAIN FALLS ONTO THERE FOR LAND SURFACE DURING VERY WET
SORT OF FLASH FLOOD EVENTS THE WATER IS TRANSFERRED FAIRLY QUICKLY OVER THERE FOR BOTH THE SURFACE OF THE LAND AND SORT OF JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE INTO RIVERS AND THEN QUICKLY MOVES DOWNSTREAM AND WHAT FOREST IS THEY CREATE A MORE COMPLEX LAND SURFACE SO WHERE YOU'VE GOT SOME TREE ROOTS AND FAWN AND WOOD AND HAVE A DEEP SOIL
HE MEANS THAT THE WATER TRANSFERS SLOWER INTO THE RIVER AND THEN WHEN IT GETS INTO THE RIVER FORESTS GENERATES A NATURAL LOG JAM AND LOTS OF COMPLEXITY IN THE CHANNEL
AND DURING FLOOD EVENTS THIS PUSHES WATER OUT ONTO THE FLOOD PLAIN AND AGAIN AS IT FLOWS OVER THAT COMPLEX SURFACE IT TRANSFERS SLOWER DOWN STREAMS LIKE THAT'S THAT THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHY WHY THEY HAVE THIS EFFECT IT'S INJURIES AS ALMOST SORT OF PHYSICAL BARRIER NOW PRESUMABLY FOR THAT TO WORK THOUGH YOU DON'T NEED ONE OR TWO TREES NEED TREES ON A PRETTY VILE SCALE
YEAH YEAH I MEAN WE FOUND THAT THE LARGEST EFFECTS PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY AFFAIR FOR VERY LARGE AREAS OF THE FOREST BUT I THINK WE CAN POTENTIALLY STRIKING A BALANCE AS WELL AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE WHERE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST AFFECTS OUR MODELLING SCENARIOS
WHERE FOREST WERE PLANTED OVER ALL OF THE DRAINAGE AREA OF A SINGLE TRIBUTARY INTO A MAIN RIVER AND SO WE FOUND THAT AREAS OF MAYBE TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE TOTAL DRAINAGE AREA WHICH IS STILL A SUBSTANTIAL
BUT THEY COULD START TO HAVE AN EFFECT AS THE FOREST GROWS UP AFTER MAYBE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THAT CAN REDUCE THE PEAK HEIGHTS OF FLOATING DOWNSTREAM BY ABOUT SIX PER CENT THAT'S THE DILEMMA PRESUMABLY FOR POLICY MAKERS WHICH IS YOU'VE GOT TO FIND AREAS THAT CAN TAKE MANY TREES NOT HOUSES OR OTHER THINGS AND YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT AN AWFULLY LONG TIME YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE
THE TWO PRINCIPLE DRAWBACKS REALLY IS JUST THAT IS THE PRACTICALITY OF FINDING THESE THESE AREAS THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THIS AND THEN ALSO YEAH IT'S GOING TO TAKE AROUND ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE WE START SEE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS
BUT THE GREAT THING IS THAT AS THE FOREST MATURES AS IT BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AND YOU START TO GET DEADWOOD LYING ON THERE ON THE FOREST FLOOR THAT THESE EFFECTS INCREASE IN IN MAGNITUDE TO SEE LARGER REDUCTIONS AS THAT WAS THE FOREST STAGES JUST IN A WORD TO DO ANY HOPE THAT THEY'LL ACTUALLY DO THEY SIR AS THE FEAR THAT IT'S SUCH A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO BE ATTEMPTING TO FRANKLY
PUT IT TO ONE SIDE AS WELL YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A DEBATE BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY ABOUT WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT FROM FROM THE LANDSCAPE REALLY DO WE WANT TO PROVE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE IT IN AREAS TO REDUCE FLOOD RISK OR POTENTIALLY ANOTHER AREAS DO WE VALUE MORE THAN THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OR EVEN THE SORT A NATURAL BEAUTY OF THE LANDSCAPE THINKING ABOUT PLACES LIKE THE NORTH YORK MOORS AND THE LAKE DISTRICT DOCTOR SIMON DICKSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANKS
SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GOT THE HANG OF CHOLESTEROL TIME TO START THINKING AGAIN PERHAPS SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT SOME PEOPLE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GOOD CHOLESTEROL ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKELY TO GET HEART DISEASE I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR ADAM BUTTERWORTH IS CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE COLE INVESTIGATED THE STUDY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING I KNOW IT'S A DANGER GETTING TECHNICAL HERE BUT BUT IS THAT RIGHT COOK GOOD CHOLESTEROL IS NOT GOOD FOR US IS THAT REALLY RIGHT
I THINK IT'S A BIT EARLY TO SAY THE GOOD CHOLESTEROL DEFINITELY ISN'T GOOD FOR US BUT I THINK WHAT WE'VE SHOWN IS THAT CERTAINLY IN SOME PEOPLE HAVING HIGHER LEVELS OF GOOD CHOLESTEROL ISN'T ACTUALLY A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AS WE THOUGHT BUT ACTUALLY INCREASED LEADS TO INCREASED RISK OF HEART ATTACKS SO WHAT SHOULD WE NOT EAT IN THAT CASE IS IF THEY DO WE SHOULDN'T EAT
SO SO MOST OF THE FOCUS AROUND PREVENTING HEART DISEASE AT THE MOMENT IS ON BAD CHOLESTEROL AND SO WE KNOW THAT TAKING DRUGS LIKE STATINS OR EATING A HEALTHY DIET LOW IN FAT AND LOW IN SUGAR AND WELL WE'LL KEEP OUR LEVELS OF BAD CHOLESTEROL DOWN SO WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWS IS THAT THE FOCUS ON BAD CHOLESTEROL SHOULD CONTINUE BUT WE NEED TO THINK OF PERHAPS BETTER WAYS TO INTERVENE ON GOOD CHOLESTEROL WE HAVE CURRENTLY RIGHT AM I RIGHT IN THINKING THAT IF FOR INSTANCE
WE EAT LOTS OF DRINK WITH IT WITH IT OLIVE OIL THAT HAS FOR INSTANCE GOOD CHOLESTEROL DOES IT YES THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME FOODS FOOD GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF GOOD CHOLESTEROL AND THIS STUDY ARE STARTING TO QUESTION THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT INCREASING GOOD CHOLESTEROL IS GOING TO LEAD TO REDUCED HEART DISEASE
SO AT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY WELL MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T USE FOR INSTANCE AGAIN OLIVE OIL PERHAPS THERE ARE BETTER EXAMPLES OF THAT ALL OF SARDINES OR WHATEVER AND DO SOMETHING ELSE
I THINK WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND IS NOT ONLY THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BUT ALSO THE HEALTH BENEFITS AS A WHOLE SO AS WELL AS INCREASING A GOOD CHOLESTEROL SOME OF THE FOODS THAT YOU MENTION HAVE A RANGE OF OTHER POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS NOT JUST ON THE KIND OF VASCULAR SYSTEMS I THINK WE SHOULDN'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER RIGHT SO YOU'RE YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT SAYING
STOP USING LOTS OF OLIVE OIL OR SARDINES OR WHATEVER THE THINGS WE REGARDED AS GOOD CLEARLY NOT SAYING THAT NO ABSOLUTELY I MEAN IN FACT I THINK THE ADVICE FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD REMAIN THE SAME IN TERMS OF EXERCISING WELL GIVING UP SMOKING EATING A HEALTHY DIET I THINK WHAT THIS STUDY SUGGESTS IS THAT WE NEED TO FIND BETTER WAYS OF INTERVENING IF WE WANT TO INTERROGATE PATHWAYS THAT RELATE TO GOOD CHOLESTEROL IN TERMS OF PREVENTING HEART DISEASE AND WHAT MIGHT THEY BE FOR INSTANCE
FOR EXAMPLE WE WE'VE STUDIED A GROUP OF PEOPLE HAVE QUITE A RARE MUTATION IN A PARTICULAR GENE AND THAT'S WHAT THAT MUTATION DOES IT STOPS A PARTICULAR PROTEIN WORKING COMPLETELY AND SO WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY IF STOPPING THE PROTEIN WORKING COMPLETELY INCREASES YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASE MAYBE WE CAN INVENT DRUGS THAT WOULD BOOST THE LEVELS OR THE FUNCTION OF THAT PROTEIN SO WE CAN WE CAN
TRY AND USE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IF YOU LIKE TWO TO PREVENT HEART DISEASE INSTEAD SO THIS SHOULD OPEN A NEW LINE OF RESEARCH IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING DRUGS RIGHT IN THE CENTRE THERE'S KEEP KID TAKEN THE STATINS ABSOLUTELY KEEP TAKING STATINS HOPPED ABOUT IT WORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR THE WET AND LOUISE LIZ HERE MORNING MORNING FOG AROUND THIS MORNING UNFORTUNATELY ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN ENGLAND SITTING DOWN THROUGH YORKSHIRE DOWN TOWARDS THE NORTH OF LONDON SOME OF IT AND SOME PLACES SHOULD START TO LIFT IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO BUT IT'S WORTH BEARING IN MIND AND THEN IT WILL LIFT ACROSS EASTERN ENGLAND AND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND TO CLOUD BUT IT WILL STAY DRY HEIGHT OF EIGHT TO TEN DEGREES THERE IS SOME STUBBORN CLOUD AROUND AT THE MOMENT SAME CLOUD ACTUALLY WE HAD YESTERDAY ALL DAY ACROSS NORTHERN ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS

AND JAPAN JAPAN HAS MARKED THE MOMENT EXACTLY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI STRUCK KILLING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND CAUSING A NUCLEAR DISASTER TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY IS DESCRIBED AS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS ANY MOVES TO CONDEMN AS RACIST PEOPLE WHO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ARRIVAL OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PARLIAMENT HOUSE MAGAZINE HE SAID IT WAS REASONABLE TO BE ANXIOUS AT A TIME OF WHAT HE CALLED SUCH COLOSSAL CRISIS ON THE ISSUE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THAT DISCUSSION SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT BRITAIN DOES IN THE WORLD IS A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT
JUSTIN WELBY TREADS A CAREFUL LINE IN HIS COMMENTS ON THE REFERENDUM HE SAYS THAT IT'S VALET TO FEEL FEAR OVER THE RESULT OF THE BOAT WHETHER THAT'S FEAR OF WHAT HAPPENS IF BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. OR REMAINS WITHIN IT
ASKED ABOUT THE REFUGEE CRISIS JUSTIN WELBY TERMS IT'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE BUT IT CAN ONLY BE HANDLED AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL SAYING THAT THE CURRENT WORK AT THE EUROPEAN SOLUTION WAS DEEPENING THE CRISIS SIGNIFICANTLY HE ALSO SAYS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF THE INFLUX OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS ON THE COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE AND THAT IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS TO CONDEMN THOSE WHO RAISE SUCH CONCERNS AS RACIST
ARCHBISHOP GOES ON TO SAY THAT BRITAIN NEEDS TO FIND WAYS OF TAKING ITS SHARE OF REFUGEES AND THAT THE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS REALLY RATHER THIN COMPARED WITH THAT MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE TAKEN BY GERMANY LAST YEAR

CAMPAIGNERS TO MAKE THEIR CASE WITH PASSION VIGOUR AND DETERMINATION IN AN INTERVIEW FOR THIS PROGRAMME HE EXPRESSES CONCERN ABOUT THE FURTHER SHOWN BY THOSE WHO WANT THE U.K. TO LEAVE HE SAYS THEIR ARGUMENT SHOULD BE COUNTED NOT JUST ON THE GROUNDS OF ECONOMIC REALISM BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL IDEALISM IT CERTAINLY TIME FOR PEOPLE
TO ARGUE THIS CASE FOR EUROPE WITH WITH SOME PASSION BECAUSE THE FACT IS IF YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME MOST FRUSTRATING ABOUT THIS IS BRITS GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD IN EUROPE
WE'VE GOT TO REALISE THE ONE HOW FAST THE WORLD IS CHANGING HOW IMPORTANT THIS RELATIONSHIP IS AND THE MASSIVE INSTABILITY THIS CAKE TO COME THERE NO GOOD PURPOSE IF WE TAKE THE WRONG DECISION
IN RESPONSE TO MISTER BLAIR'S COMMENTS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN GROUP SAID THAT IF THE U.K. CHOSE TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. IT WOULD HAND OVER MORE MONEY AND MORE POWER TO BRUSSELS IN RETURN FOR SOME HOLLOW PROMISES
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SOUGHT TO SMOOTH RELATIONS WITH THE U.K. AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA CRITICISED BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN A MAGAZINE INTERVIEW MY OBAMA SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD ALLOWED LIBYA TO BECOME A MESS FOLLOWING THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE WHITE HOUSE LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT PRAISING DAVID CAMERON AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO POOL REPORTS
THIS UNSOLICITED STATEMENTS SENT TO ME BY A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN SEEMS TO SHOW THE ADMINISTRATION IN SERIOUS DAMAGE LIMITATION MODE NED PRICE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL PRAISE DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP IN NATO AND ON MEETING THE COMMITMENT TO SPEND TWO PER CENT OF NATIONAL INCOME ON DEFENCE

LABOUR IS SEEKING TO WIN BACK VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS ECONOMIC POLICIES BY ANNOUNCING IT WILL ABIDE BY WHAT IT CALLED A NEW FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE THE MEASURE BINDS ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE DAY TO DAY SPENDING WITH THE AMOUNT IT RACES IN TAXES THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL USE HER SPEECH IN LONDON TO SAY A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY DISCIPLINED AND ONLY BORROW TO INVEST MORE DETAILS FROM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMO ARMOURED
IT IS A MAJOR ATTEMPT TO REPOSITION THE LABOUR PARTY ON THE ECONOMY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT WING ABOUT EXCESSIVE SPENDING THE FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE WILL OBLIGE ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND WHAT THE PARTY DESCRIBES HER DAY TO DAY SPENDING IT WILL ALLOW FOR BORROWING FOR INVESTMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUCH AS NEW ROADS AND RAILWAYS
JOHN MACDONALD TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT LABOUR HAD TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC DEBT WILL FALL UNDER A LABOUR GOVERNMENT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD
AND THEN FINALLY ALL THIS WILL BE SUPERVISED INDEPENDENTLY BY THE OFFERS A BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING DIRECTLY TO POWER THIS IS A NEW IRON DISCIPLINE FOR A LABOUR GOVERNMENT LABOUR SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED TO ME THAT A LACK OF ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE PARTY AT THE LAST ELECTION THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE SAID THAT ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD PUT THE PUBLIC FINANCES AT RISK

TALKS HAVE BEEN SPORADIC SINCE THEY GOT UNDERWAY IN THE AUTUMN BUT THE B.B.C. UNDERSTANDS THAT SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT WEEKS A B.M.A. SPOKESWOMAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TALKS WERE ONGOING BUT SAID THERE WAS NOT YET ANY AGREEMENT ANY OFFER WOULD HAVE TO BE PUT TO A VOTE BY THE B.M.A. IS CONSULTANT MEMBERSHIP
A STUDY SAYS PLANTING TREES AROUND RIVERS COULD REDUCE THE HEIGHT OF FLOODING IN TOWNS DOWNSTREAM BY UP TO TWENTY PER CENT THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY MINISTERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TREES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY ALONG WITH IMPROVE DEFENCES AND MORE DREDGING IS OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER KARABIN
WITH MORE BUILDING ON FLOOD PLAINS AND CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASING THE RISK OF HEAVY RAIN EXPERTS WARN THAT WE CAN'T PROTECT EVERYWHERE FROM FLOODS THERE'S BEEN A RUSH OF INTEREST IN NATURAL METHODS PLANTING TREES AND CREATING LEAKY DAMS WHICH HOLD BACK WATER BY CREATING MINI FLOODS UPSTREAM
THE STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITIES OF BIRMINGHAM AND SOUTHAMPTON CONCLUDES THAT THE LEAKY DAMS SOMETIMES HELP AND SOMETIMES DON'T
BUT STRATEGIC TREE PLANTING COVERING BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY PER CENT OF THE FEEDER STREAM CAN REDUCE THE FLOODS PEAK BY A FIFTH AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE CRITICAL
ROGER HAS BEEN REPORTING IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LIBYA IS A MESS SO FAR SO UNCONTROVERSIAL BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID A LOT MORE THAN THAT HE'S CRITICISED DAVID CAMERON FOR GETTING DISTRACTED AFTER PERSUADING HIM TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST COLONEL GADAFFI BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
HE'S CONDEMNED WHAT HE CALLS THE HABIT OF PEOPLE PUSHING US TO ACT BUT THEN SHOWING AN UNWILLINGNESS TO PUT ANY SKIN IN THE GAME AND IN AN INTERVIEW WITH ATLANTIC MAGAZINE HE GOES ON I HAD MORE FAITH IN THE EUROPEANS BEING INVESTED
IN THE FOLLOW UP SO WHAT HAS UPSET THE PRESIDENT SO MUCH I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO ALEC ROSS FOR MISS SENIOR ADVISOR TO HILLARY CLINTON IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT I THINK WHAT'S FRUSTRATING THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
EMMA HOPE ALL THEIR AND REMOVAL OF HER BROOD ALL GOT OFF OR DICTATOR ELECTED A WOULD LEAD TO A MORE PEACEFUL PROSPEROUS
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO BE DRAGGED TO SUDDEN BELIEVE RATHER RELUCTANTLY INTO INTERVENING IN LIBYA BY THE BRITISH BY THE FRENCH BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT INDEED DOES HE FEEL THAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE THEN FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH
THIS WERE COMING IN LIBYA BUT NOT SHORTCOMINGS LIVE AMERICANS OR EUROPEAN ULTIMATELY IT LOLA
BUT IN WHICH CASE WHAT WHERE DOES THE FRUSTRATION STEMS FROM ABOUT THE EUROPEANS NOT DOING ENOUGH WELL YOU KNOW I THINK IT PROBABLY STEMS FROM THE BACK TO UNITED PEOPLE STOP STOPPERS SPREAD THEN THAT WE HOPED SOMEBODY WOULD HELP BUILD THE BREACH SERVICE ICK BUT I DO PICK IT SO MUCH ANGER OR FRUSTRATION AS YOU KNOW BROADLY DON'T DISAPPOINT
WE GET BETTER THERE ARE IN THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS TO ATLANTIC MAGAZINE THOUGH SOME BROADER CRITICISMS OF THE U.K. IN PARTICULAR THE CONCERN THERE DOES IT WHERE WE WANTED ON THE CHEAP THAT WE WERE RELUCTANT TO SPEND WHAT NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON DEFENCE
BUT THE PRESIDENT LEAN DEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE SURE THAT TWO PERCENT OF GREAT BRITAIN G.D.P. ONE ENDED DEFENCE SPENDING AND THAT SHORTLY THEREAFTER THERE WAS THE COMMITMENT
TO ANOTHER IT WAS CAN HELP US OUT HERE FRIENDS FINALLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THE SOLUTION NOW IN LIBYA IS MORE MILITARY ACTION SPECIAL FORCES ON THE GROUND MORE AIR STRIKES TO TRY AND STOP ISIS TAKING PARTICULARLY THE OILFIELDS IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD
WE CAN'T KEEP ISIS GRANT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING IT CAPER
LIBYA'S STABILITY AND ULTIMATELY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO
LIBYAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME MEASURE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOVERNING THEMSELVES INCOMING COMING TOGETHER OTHERWISE THERE NO AMOUNT OF AMERICAN EUROPEAN OR PLANE BETTER
BUT ULTIMATELY COULD BE AN AWFULLY LONG TIME AWAY IS CERTAINLY
TWENTY YEARS AGO
ROSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NOW THE U.K. GOVERNMENT WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES IN THE FIRING LINE THE FRENCH ALSO COME IN FOR CRITICISM FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE CLAIM THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY TRIED TO HOG THE SPOTLIGHT IN LIBYA AND BRAGGED ABOUT HIS COUNTRY'S ROLE HERE'S THE RESPONSE OF HERVEY MERIT OR AN M.P. FROM NICHOLAS OH CASEY'S PARTY THE REPUBLICANS
HE'D UNDERLINED THAT BETWEEN I LIE THAT SORT OF BIRD WE'RE HEATING THING I MEAN YOU WERE CONCERNING UP AT ONE TIME I WANTED TO DO YOU NO BUT HE'S NOT A BIT
THE BRITISH THE FRENCH AND INDEED THE AMERICANS ALSO IT MANAGEMENT DOCUMENTS IN
I SAID WE'RE NOT IN THE ACTION WAS NOT ENOUGH AND INTO TO BE INCREDIBLY MESSY SITUATION IN LIBYA HAS HE NOT GOT A POINT THOUGH THAT THE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME MISSUS SARKOZY YOUR PARTY LEADER AS WELL AS DAVID CAMERON RATHER LIGHT GRANDSTANDING IN BENGHAZI THE PRESENT IS QUOTED AS SAYING SARKOZY WANTED TO TRUMPET THE FLIGHTS
THAT FRANCE WAS CONTRIBUTING TO THE AIR CAMPAIGN DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'D WIPED OUT ALL THE AIR DEFENCES AND WE'D SET UP THE ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT HE REFERRED TO IT AS BRAGGING
PREGNANT ABOUT UM I WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME SORT OF BEHAVIOUR ONE CAN CRITICISE
POLITICAL LEADERS TO LOOK TOO MUCH ON THE COMMUNICATION ASPECT
PLAYING THEIR PART THE U.S. HONESTLY DID N. WILL WAKE YOU AT HAND TO A WEEK OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING UP AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS IN HIS MEMOIRS BUT TODAY
THIS TOADSTOOL LUCK OFF REAL INDIAN GOVERNMENT AND IT IS WELL
AND IF THEY DO CONCENTRATE IF PARIS AND LONDON CONCENTRATE TO WHAT AN EARTH DO WE DO NOW GIVEN THE MESS AS THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED IT THE COUNTRY'S IN WE HONESTLY DO
INDIAN TRIBES SOME SORT OF UNITY YOU KNOW THE EXTREME CREATION
VIKING

TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD CAKE BAKER KATIE ATKINSON SAYS IN HER OWN WORDS SHE WANTS A DIVORCE
IT'S A LOT OF SCARE MOM IN THIS IN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WE HAVE NO TRADE OR ANYTHING WELL IF WE PULL OUT THIS CHANCE WE CAN BRING THAT TRAY AT HOME AND WE CAN POP PEOPLE WHATEVER PLIED INTO BUSINESS BUT THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT WE WILL BE STRONGER IT'S PART OF THE EUROPEAN
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL THESE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S A DICTATORSHIP OF EUROPE WOULD BE IF WE STAND ON OUR OWN THEN THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WE COULD BE BACK HE'S AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY
LIKE OTHERS WE HEARD FROM WHO SHARE HER VIEW A KEY POINT SEEMS TO BE JOB
THEY ARGUE LEAVING WOULD MEAN MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO DO THE WORK THAT IS OCCUPIED BY PEOPLE FROM EAST
TWO STUDENTS FROM THE LOCAL COLLEGE SAY IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GO
SO I THINK IT'S BETTER THEY GO ECONOMY FOR THE FUTURE AND ALSO WE CAN WORK OVER THERE
AND GO OVER VISAS PASSPORTS I THINK IT'S SYRIA FOR YOU LEAVE SOME PEOPLE SAY WILL HAVE MORE SIGNIFICANCE IF WE DO STAND ALONE THAT WILL BE MORE POWERFUL ON NUMEROUS
I HAVE READ IT'S ALL NEGATIVE FOR KIND OF GOOD
C. MAKE A REPORTING THERE IT'S TWENTY ONE MINUTES AFTER SEVEN BUDGET NEXT WEEK OF COURSE AND THE U.K. ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN WHICH COULD MATTHEW HAVE SOME PRETTY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC FINANCES IT REALLY COULD YES NICK AND THAT WE'RE GETTING THIS FROM THE BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WHICH HAVE DOWNGRADED THEIR U.K. ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECASTS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS MAINLY THEY SAY BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE B.C.C. THINKS THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS VERY LIKELY GOING TO BREAK HIS FISCAL CHARTER WHICH COMMITS THE GOVERNMENT TO A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY DOCTOR ADAM MARSHALL IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE B. C. C. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MATTHEW WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND THE SLOW DOWN IS IT JUST GLOBAL FACTORS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF GLOBAL FACTORS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE U.K. ECONOMY OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN THE TURMOIL ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN RECENT WEEKS WE'VE SEEN COMMODITY PRICES IN THE PRICE OF OIL IN PARTICULAR UP AND DOWN
YOU'VE GOT ECONOMIES ELSEWHERE I'D LIKE THE EUROZONE WITH HUGE STIMULUS MEASURES UNVEILED YESTERDAY WHERE THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE ECONOMIES AND OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT THE KIND OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY WE TALK ABOUT IN PLACES LIKE THE MIDDLE EAST THERE A HUGE NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT IMPACT US HERE AT HOME AND IMPACT OF BUSINESSES HERE IN THE U.K. I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER PEOPLE WILL ATTACH AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AND CREDIBILITY TO WHAT YOU SAY IN THIS REPORT AND ELSEWHERE AFTER THE EVENTS INVOLVING THE B. C. C. IF THE LAST WEEK
I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT ON THE EVENTS THAT YOU REFERRED TO THERE BUT IN TERMS OF A FORECAST WE ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS HERE AS YOU SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION WHEN THE CHANCELLOR COMES TO HIS BUDGET NEXT WEEK HE'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE SOME SERIOUS CHOICES ONE OF THE CHOICES WE DO VERY MUCH HOPE YOU WILL TAKE IS TO BRING FORWARD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHEREVER HE CAN AND ALSO OF COURSE TO STOP THE DRIP OF NEW TAXES ON BUSINESSES THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN GIVE CONFIDENCE
A PERIOD OF SOME FRAGILITY AND UNCERTAINTY FOR THE ECONOMY IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OFF THE B. C. C.'S CREDIBILITY AND INDEED ITS INDEPENDENCE AND THAT THERE THERE'S A LOT OF REPORTING ABOUT THE FACT THAT DOWNING STREET LEANT HEAVILY ON JOHN LONGWORTH YOUR FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL TO RESIGN AFTER HE MADE THOSE COMMENTS SAYING THAT HE FAVOURED LEAVING THAT SURELY YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS OF YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND CREDIBILITY
BEFORE WE READ TOO MUCH INTO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ON OTHER ISSUES I THINK OUR INDEPENDENCE AND CREDIBILITY ARE ABSOLUTE I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT ON THAT MATTER I THINK OUR PRESIDENT NORA SENIOR SAID IT ALL WHEN SHE APPEARED ON THE MEDIA EARLIER THIS WEEK YOU INVITED ME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT MATTERS TO BUSINESS IN THE ECONOMY THE REFERENDUM IS JUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT MATTER TO OUR BUSINESSES AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE AS WELL
ALL YOU MENTION OR A SENIOR I MEAN IT IS REPORTED THAT SHE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL DIRECTLY FROM A DOWNING STREET AID COMPLAINING ABOUT JOHN LONGWORTH WORTH'S COMMENTS DID THAT HAPPEN I MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT BORING FOR YOU LISTENERS MATTHEW AND SAY I'VE GOT NO FURTHER COMMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION WHAT YOU CAN SEE WHY I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN IN THE BRITISH BUSINESS CONTACTS
YOUR MEMBERS EMPLOY SOME FIVE MILLION PEOPLE YOU NEED TO HAVE CREDIBILITY AS AN ORGANISATION AND YET YOUR CREDIBILITY IN THE LAST WEEK HAS BEEN SHOT TO PIECES HAS IT NOT
AND WE ARE A CREDIBLE BUSINESS ORGANISATION WE HAVE A LONG STANDING POSITION OF NEUTRALITY ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE OF COURSE THAT WAS DEMANDED OF US BUY OUR OWNERS THE LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY AND OF COURSE THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY REAL DIVISIONS IN LOCAL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES I'M IN DEVON TODAY WITH BUSINESSES I'M SURE I WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT PARTICULAR DEBATE
LOOKING FORWARD BUT WE'RE GOING TO LOSE MY POSITION PRESUMABLY ARGUMENTS NOT JUST ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATE BUT BIASED WHOLLY IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. THE MAJORITY OF YOUR MEMBERS WANT TO REMAIN WHY DON'T YOU JUST COME OUT AND SUPPORT THAT AS I SAY BUSINESSES ARE DIVIDED I LATER SO THEY'RE NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP THEY CERTAINLY ARE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY SIXTY PER CENT MADE A SURVEY DO WANT TO REMAIN THIRTY PERCENT WANT TO LEAVE TEN PER CENT ARE UNSURE
WILL CONTINUE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS OF BUSINESSES IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM AS WE ALL KNOW THESE KINDS OF THINGS CAN CHANGE PAUL'S CAN CHANGE BUT WE WON'T TAKE SIDES BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO YOU ACTUALLY GET INTO BUSINESS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AS I AM DOING TODAY YOU HERE IS A VERY BIG RANGE OF VIEWS WE HAVE TO RESPECT THOSE VIEWS WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR NEUTRALITY AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO THAT LOOKING FORWARD UNTIL THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY DECIDES HOW IT WANTS TO VOTE ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD
ADAM MARSHALL ACTING DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE B. C.

TONY BLAIR HAS URGED THOSE CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. TO SHOW SOME OF THE FURTHER DISPLAYED BY THEIR EURO SCEPTIC OPPONENTS THE FORMER LABOUR PRIME MINISTER TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT IT WAS TIME TO ARGUE THE CASE WITH PASSION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF POLITICAL IDEALISM AS WELL AS ECONOMIC REALISM
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS INSISTED IT DEEPLY VALUES AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA CRITICISE DAVID CAMERON FOR HIS ACTIONS IN LIBYA MY OBAMA HAD ACCUSED BRITAIN AND FRANCE HAVE LEAVING LIBYA IN A MESS FOLLOWING THEIR MILITARY INTERVENTION THERE
THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL OUTLINE A TOUGHER ECONOMIC APPROACH FOR A FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT PROMISING THAT IT WOULD BALANCE SPENDING WITH THE AMOUNT IT RECEIVES IN TAXES HE'LL SAY IN A SPEECH IN LONDON THAT IT WILL BORROW ONLY TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT HIS NEW IRON DISCIPLINE WILL PUSH DOWN DEBT
A MOMENT OF SILENCE HAS BEEN HELD IN JAPAN TO MARK THE TIME EXACTLY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE TRIGGERED A TSUNAMI THAT DEVASTATED THE COUNTRY'S NORTH EAST COAST THE WATER SERVED THREE TERMS KILLING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND CRIPPLING THE FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR PLANT
THE CANDIDATES FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IN THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND HELD THEIR LAST DEBATE BEFORE CRUCIAL PRIMARIES TAKE PLACE ON TUESDAY THE FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP HAS CONFIRMED THAT HE SECURED THE ENDORSEMENT OF HIS FORMER RIVAL BEN CARSON A RETIRED NEUROSURGEON WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE EARLIER THIS MONTH
SCIENTISTS SAY STRATEGIC TREE PLANTING CAN REDUCE PEAK FLOOD LEVELS IN TOWNS BY UP TO TWENTY PER CENT THE RESEARCHERS FROM BIRMINGHAM AND SOUTHAMPTON UNIVERSITY'S CONCLUDED THAT NATURAL DEFENCES COULD CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO FLOOD PREVENTION BUT ONLY WHEN COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL METHODS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO EIGHT IT IS FIVE YEARS TO THE DAY SINCE A GIANT EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI HIT NORTH EAST JAPAN IT LEFT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DEAD IT CRIPPLED THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AT FUKUSHIMA
RAISING FEARS OF MANY MORE PEOPLE DYING FROM RADIATION SICKNESS PEOPLE LIVING IN THE AREA WERE FORCED TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF IT AND I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO THEM FOR FEAR OF CONTAMINATION NOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTHORITIES ON THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON THE HUMAN BODY HAS SAID THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THAT SHE'S PROFESSOR GERRY THOMAS OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND SHE SAYS THE WORLD HAS HUGELY OVERESTIMATED THE DANGER OF RADIATION LEAKS FROM NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO
IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS FROM POWER STATIONS AND CAUSE A HIGH AMOUNTS OF DOSE OF RADIATION TO INDIVIDUALS BUT IN ACTUAL FACT THEY ARE A LOT A LOT LOWER THAN PEOPLE THINK AND PEOPLE TEND TO EQUATE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS WITH THE ATOMIC BOMB AND THE TWO ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS IN WATER
WELL IN THE SENSE THAT THE RADIATION IS DIFFERENT FROM AN ATOMIC BOMB EXPLOSION YOU GET A LOT OF GAMMA RADIATION PRODUCED AND FROM MAGIC YOUR ACCENT LIKE CHERNOBYL FOR CONSUMER YOU GET MAINLY ISOTOPIC RADIATION HOSE CAESIUM ONE THREE SEVEN PREDOMINANTLY AN I.D. MONTHLY ONE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT THESE ARE BETA EMITTERS THAT YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY TAKE HIM TO YOUR BODY FOR THEM TO HAVE ANY EFFECT ON YOUR HEALTH SO WHY ARE WE SO SCARED OF RADIATION FROM NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS
I THINK IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE EQUATE IT WITH WHAT WE UNDERSTAND OF THE ATOMIC BOMBS AND PARTICULARLY MY GENERATION WE WERE BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT ATOMIC WEAPON THAT WENT OFF WOULD PROBABLY FINISH A SPECIES ON THE PLANET AND WE SEEM TO HAVE A CONFUSED THE TWO IN OUR MINDS AND THEREFORE FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE ON FROM THERE
I THINK ALSO WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THE EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR POWER AND ACCIDENTS UNTIL WE'VE HAD IS SUFFICIENT TIME AFTER THEY'VE HAPPENED TO TO REALLY LOOK AT THE RESULTS AND WITH THEIR NOW WITH THIRTY YEARS PAST THE THE ATOM TO THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR SO WE'VE GOT ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF DATA TO LOOK AT AND SAY IT'S NOT THE SAME AS AN ATOMIC WEAPON AND WE COULD NOW PROVE THAT AD IS THERE AN ARGUMENT IN THAT CASE IF IT IS AS I WAS GOING TO USE THE WOULD BE NINE AS YOU'RE SUGGESTING BUT BUT BUT
LET ME BE QUITE CLEAR ABOUT THIS YOU'RE NOT SAYING THERE IS NO DANGER IN THIS RADIATION IT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF IT THAT WE SHOULD RE APPRAISE THE WHOLE THING
YEAH ABSOLUTELY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THERE'S NO RISK THERE'S ACTUALLY NO RISK TO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE DO IN LIFE YOU KNOW FLYING IN A PLANE HAS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT IT ALSO HAS A RADIATION DOSE ASSOCIATED WITH IT BELIEVE IT OR NOT SO IN ACTUAL FACT THE DOSES THAT WERE AROUND FUCKER SHAMEMA HAVE BEEN CALCULATED TO BE ABOUT ONE MILLISIEVERTS A NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THAT'S A TENTH OF THE C.T. SCAN
THAT'S ALL SO THEY MASSIVELY OVER PANICKED AT FAKHER SHIMMER EYE THING OVER PANICKED MIGHT BE A BIT A BIT OF LEMON OVER WRONG WAY TO DESCRIBE IT I THINK ANYBODY IN THAT SITUATION WOULD HAVE DONE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED POST FOR CONSUMER BUT WITH HINDSIGHT WE CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE OVERESTIMATED THE DAMAGE WE WERE DOING
BY SAYING THERE AND ACTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER TO TREAT THIS AS IF IT WAS LIKE A CHEMICAL TOXIN AND WHAT TO WEAR OR DO WE TOLD THEN STAY INDOORS YOU WINDOWS AND DOOR SHUT AND WE'LL COME AND GET YOU WHEN IT'S SAFE IF WE NEED TO EVACUATE YOU AND IT GIVES YOU TIME TO APPRAISE WHAT THE DOSES WOULD BE WHAT THE WRITTEN RELEASES WOULD BE AND TIME TO PUT A PROPER PLAN IN PLACE RIGHT A FINAL THOUGHT
ARE WE THEREFORE SPENDING TO WASTING MONEY ON OVER PROTECTING OURSELVES WHEN WE BUILD A NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS SUCH AS FOR INSTANCE HINKLEY POINT
I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE IN DANGER OF DOING THAT I I'M NOT AN ENGINEER SO I'M NOT BEST PLACED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BY POLLUTANTS FROM COAL POWER STATIONS A NUMBER OF ILLNESSES WE CREATE FROM COAL POWER STATIONS IS MUCH MUCH HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE CHIN UP AN ACCIDENT NOBODY DIE FROM FOCUS EMA BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ANXIETY CREATED AROUND IT
IF YOU BALANCE THOSE ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO COAL AND FOSSIL FUELS IS GOING TO A. CAUSE MORE POLLUTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE KNOW DOES HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON HER HEALTH AND B. WILL ALSO HAVE EFFECTS ON ON CLIMATE CHANGE YOU COULD HEAR HIS IS CARBON LOW AND WE HAD THOSE PLANTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT'S SECURE WHEN YOU BALANCE IT ALL UP AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING OF GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT
ACTUALLY NUCLEAR IS NOT AS BAD AN OCTOPUS I THINK AND MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ARE WE TRYING TO BE TOO SAFE YOU CAN'T REDUCE RISK TO NOTHING IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT
AND WILL THERE AS WE SPEAK WILL THERE BE PEOPLE OUT THERE EXPERTS LIKE YOURSELVES SITTING OVER THERE CALLED PETER SAYING SHE'S MAD IT'S MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN SHE'S SAYING THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING I'M MAD BUT I THINK THAT THE BALANCE OF SCIENTIFIC OPINION IS NOW COMING DOWN ON
LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE ASSESS WHAT'S THAT THEY REAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN OF THESE ACCIDENTS AND PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE WITH OTHER RISK THEIR LIVES AND MOST OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY SITTING THERE SAYING YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO TAKE NOTICE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WE HAVE TO REAPPRAISE BECAUSE IN YOU KNOW TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS' TIME WITH A LOOK BACK AT US THEY MIGHT THINK WE ARE COMPLETELY MAD BECAUSE WE'D BE OVERCAUTIOUS PROFESSOR GERRY THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE GOLD HE HAS NO DOUBT THAT JOHN MCDONNELL IS TRYING TO WIN BACK FOR LABOUR REPUTATION FOR ECONOMIC COMPETENCE TALKING TO THE PAPER THE SHOW THE CHANCELLOR SAYS RESTORING CREDIBILITY WILL BE THE STRUGGLE OF HER GENERATION WRITING IN THE DAILY MIRROR MY MCDONALD'S HAS HIS FISCAL RULES WILL BE FAIR AND BALANCED THE ECONOMICS EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT IS INCLINED TO AGREE JUDGING THEM TO BE WELL DESIGNED SENSIBLE AND AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS NOT JUST LABOUR'S POLICIES THAT ARE SEEN AS MATTERING TO THE PARTY'S CHANCES OF SUCCESS SEVERAL PAPERS CONSIDER ITS LEADERSHIP TO THE EXPRESS THINKS THE FORMER PARATROOPER DEVELOPED DOWN JARVIS LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ON MANOEUVRES DURING A SPEECH THIS WEEK QUENTIN LETTS IN THE MALE DOESN'T RATE HIS CHANCES OF REPLACING MY ORGAN HE THOUGHT MISTER JARVIS WAS CLEAN AND TIDY BUT NOT NECESSARILY ONE OF LIFE'S SPARKLERS YOU MIGHT FIND A STRONGER ELECTRICAL CHARGE FROM A BICYCLE DYNAMO HE SAID THAT DATE IN THEM
PATRICK KID OF THE TIMES THOUGHT IT GOT OFF TO AN AWKWARD START WHEN THE PRESS REALISED THERE WERE NO PASTRIES NO BACON ROLLS NOT EVEN A PLATE OF STALE BISCUITS JUST A COUPLE OF FLASKS OF COFFEE AND A JUG OF WATER WITH THINLY SLICED CUCUMBER IN IT THAT HE SAYS THERE'S NOT A MOUNTAIN A LAUNCH OF A LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH TOM PECK AT THE INDEPENDENT DID THINK THE
CUCUMBER WATER WAS SURPRISINGLY REFRESHING NOT THAT ANY SELF RESPECTING JEALOUS WILL BE SWAYED BY SORRY STRAIGHT SO ABOUT HOW THEY'RE FED AND WATERED NOW WHOEVER TAKES CHARGE OF LABOUR AT THE NEXT ELECTION IT WON'T BE DAVID CAMERON LEADING THE CONSERVATIVES OF COURSE THE MALE APPLAUD HIS SUGGESTION THOUGH THAT HE HOPES TO STAY ON AS A BACKBENCH M.P. IT SAYS THE SPEEDY SPEEDY DEPARTURE OF SOME PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTERS IS WORRYING AND FEEL SURE HE HAS MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE GOVERNMENTS JUST LIKE HIS PREDECESSORS DAVID LLOYD GEORGE AND WINSTON CHURCHILL
MICHAEL DEACON OF THE TELEGRAPH OR SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TIME REPORTING ON THE SPEECHES MISTER CAMERON HAS MADE IN RECENT DAYS ARGUING FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE DEBATE SO FAR HE NOTES THAT SO FAR IN THIS CAMPAIGN WE'VE YET TO SEE MISTER CAMERON TRIED TO WIN ROUND AN UNFRIENDLY AUDIENCE FOR THEM AS HE KEEPS TELLING US IT'S IMPORTANT TO AVOID RISK THE SUNDA VOTES IT'S FROM PAGE TO A PERFORMANCE BY MADONNA IN AUSTRALIA DURING WHICH HE DRESSED UP AS A CLOWN ROAD A CHILD'S TRICYCLE
AND SEEMED TO HAVE DRUNK TOO MUCH IF YOU KNOW THE LYRICS YOU'LL GET THIS HEADLINE LIKE A THIRD JUNE IS THE PAPER'S HEADLINE SMASHED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME ON STAGE THE SON ATTRIBUTES HER CONCERT MELT DOWN TO THE CONTINUING COURT BATTLE ABOUT THE CUSTODY OF THE CYGNUS ESTRANGED SON FOR QUITE
LIFE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF WORK THAT IN SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT NOW THE NEWS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE GOOD WHEN THE CHANCELLOR TAKES HIS SPEECH OUT OF THAT FAMOUS RED BUDGET BOX NEXT WEEK GEORGE OSBORNE MAY TELL US THAT GROWTH IS SLOWING WHICH MAY MEAN THAT TEXAS HAVE TO RISE OR SPENDING HAS TO BE CUT FURTHER OR BOTH
BUT HOW RELIABLE ARE THEIR STATISTICS ON WHICH THOSE POLICIES WILL BE BASED OR WE STILL IF YOU LIKE USING ANALOGUE DATA IN A DIGITAL AGE THERE WAS A QUESTION WHICH PROFESSOR SIR CHARLIE BEAM FORMER DUCK DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS BEEN EXAMINING ANY JOINS ME IN THE STUDIO NOW COULD THE WRONG DATA PROFESSOR SIR CHARLIE BE LEADING TO THE ROOM POLICY
YES I THINK THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH THAT'S TRUE THE STATISTICAL CONVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE THE COVEN THINGS LIKE KEEP P. WERE PUT IN PLACE DECADES AGO WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS DOMINATED BY MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCED RELATIVELY HOMOGENOUS PRODUCTS
THE MODERN ECONOMY IS VERY DIFFERENT DOMINATED BY SERVICES DIGITAL ISATION EVERYWHERE YOU'VE GOT NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND THAT HAS REALLY CHANGED THE WAY WE SHOULD MEASURE THINGS AMONG GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
A FEW YEARS AGO IF YOU WANT TO GO ON HOLIDAY YOU GO DOWN TO THE TRAVEL AGENT TRAVEL AGENT WOULD CHARGE YOU FOR A BOOKING A FLIGHT BOOKING ACCOMMODATION YOU'D GO AND BUY GUIDE SAY FIND YOUR WAY AROUND THE CITY DEFINITELY LIKE PAY AND IN ORDER TO AMOUNT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL BACK HOME WHEN YOU'VE GOT THEM WHAT HAPPENS TODAY YOU PROBABLY DO IT ONLINE DIRECT BOOK BOOKED DIRECT WITH THE
AN AIRLINE BOOKED ACCOMMODATION THROUGH A B.&B. YOUSE ARE FREE GOOGLE MAP TO GET AROUND FREE COMMUNICATION BACK HOME THROUGH SKYPE OR WHAT'S THAT IS THAT NOT CAPTURED IN THE JEEP WELL IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THAT IN ACTUALLY REDUCES T. P. BECAUSE YOU'VE THE WAY G. V. P. IS MEASURED
TAKES OUT THE SERVICES THAT THE TRAVEL AGENT AND SO FORTH WERE PROVIDING BEFORE AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT REPLACES IT
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN A REPORT WILL BE RELEASED IN ABOUT AN HOUR'S TIME HE'S TRIED TO PUT SOME ESTIMATES ON THE VALUE OF THESE THINGS WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IF IF G. V. P. WOULD BE FINDING A DIFFERENT WAY AND I WANT TO EMPHASISE IT I'M NOT SAYING HERE THAT THE STATISTICS ARE WRONG THEY COULD LOOK AT IT A BIT BUT IF YOU HAD A DIFFERENT CONCEPT
THAT GROWTH COULD BE AS MUCH AS THREE QUARTS OF PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO SO THERE AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS AUSTERITY WAS PUT POSSIBLY I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE FULL LEAPED IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY BECAUSE THAT THAT'S QUITE A LARGELY BUT IT'S AN INDICATION
THE STATISTICS ARE LAGGING BEHIND THE REALITY IN THE ECONOMY SO ONE OF THEM AND THE THINGS THAT THE REPORT WOULD SUGGEST TODAY IS THAT I STATISTICIANS NEED TO BE MORE AGILE
AND CURIOUS ABOUT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENT SO THEY NEED TO BE IN LONDON BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSIES THAT SAID THE STATISTICS WEREN'T SO GOOD WHEN THE OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS WAS FORCED TO MOVE TO CARDIFF NOTHING WRONG WITH CARDIFF BUT THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT LOTS OF VERY SKILLED PEOPLE GAVE UP THEIR JOBS AND YOU HAD LESS GOOD PEOPLE DOING THE WORK THERE WHAT THERE WAS A TRANSITION COS OF THE THE MOVE TO NEWPORT RATHER THAN FORGIVE ME CUT CARVE IT FROM THAT
OF THE GROUP OF STATISTICIANS WHO MOVED DOWN THERE HELLO OTHER NATIONAL ACCOUNTANTS AND SIMILAR PEOPLE ABOUT NINETY PER CENT ACTUALLY LEFT THE ORGANISATION NO PROBLEM NO POINT DOING THAT NOW NO NO I MEAN IT I THINK IT WOULD BE SILLY TO TALK ABOUT MOVING BACK BECAUSE THEY'VE RECRUITED NEW PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING UP THE EXPERIENCE
IF YOU MOVE BACK THEY'LL BE SAYING WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN LONDON WANT TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING YOU HERE THEY'RE TO GIVE YOUR VERDICT ON THE U.K. ECONOMY WE HEARD YOUR OLD BOSS MERVYN KING SAYING ANOTHER CRISIS IS CERTAIN THERE'S A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS AROUND HOW NERVY
WELL AT THE REAR AT THE RISK OF DIVERTING A BIT FROM MY MY FORMER COLLEAGUES AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CRISIS THAT I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH SOMEWHERE SOMETIME AND PERSONALLY I THINK SOME OF THE FEARS ARE OVERDONE AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NO DOUBT IT'S VENTED RISKS OUT THERE PEOPLE CHINA HANDLE LIPS SLOWING WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT CONCERNS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE REFERENDUM HERE
BUT IT'S EASY TO OVERDO THE GLOOM A MATCHING THE FUNDAMENTALS IN THE U.K. ECONOMY THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS ARE REASONABLY GOOD AT THE MOMENT SO MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WE WILL SEE CONTINUED MODERATE GROWTH THAT YOU MENTIONED THE RISK POSED BY THE REFERENDUM ANOTHER BOSS AS IT WERE MARK CARNEY THE CURRENT GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID IT IS THE BIGGEST DOMESTIC RISK FACING THE ECONOMY IS GETTING OUT OF THE EAR IS HE RIGHT
WELL HE'S THEY CREATE SHORT TERM UNCERTAINTY WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM ALREADY SOME OF THE WEAKNESS OF STERLING IS ALMOST CERTAINLY DOWN TO FEARS ABOUT POSSIBLE EXIT INVESTMENT HAS WEAKENED RECENTLY AND THAT
MAY BE DOWN TO HER BUSINESSES JUST SAYING I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I'M JUST GOING TO HOLD OFF INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE IF THE DECISION WENT TO LEAVE THAT THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD AFTERWARDS WHERE THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP
IT WAS BEING NEGOTIATED WHICH WOULD LEAD TO CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND THAT PROBABLY WOULD PUT A DAMPENER ON OUR INVESTMENT SO THERE ARE RISKS THAT PROFESSORS ARE JOLLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH US THIS MORNING IS BISHOP RICHARD HARRIS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING A FEW YEARS AGO ONE OF MY GRANDSONS WHO WAS A KEEN TENNIS PLAYER WAS THRILLED TO MEET MARIA SHARAPOVA HE LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHER TENNIS FANS AROUND THE WORLD WILL NOW BE VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE ALLEGATION AGAINST HER AND HOPING FOR THE BEAR SPOKE FOR HER AND THE SPORT
LEAVING ASIDE HER CASE WHAT DOES HAPPEN THERE'S ALSO HIGHLIGHTED A WIDER ISSUE ACROSS MANY SPORTS THERE ARE PEOPLE TAKING ILLEGAL DRUGS BECAUSE OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ENHANCING QUALITIES RATHER THAN FOR A MEDICAL CONDITION
IN SHORT THERE IS AN ETHICAL GREY AREA AND ETHICAL GREY AREAS OR NOT OF COURSE CONFINED TO SPORT THEY EXIST IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN LIFE POLITICS BUSINESS AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
DRAMATIC EXAMPLE ACUTE OCCURRED A FEW YEARS AGO WITH THE M.P.S' EXPENSES SCANDAL ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR WAS ILLEGAL BUT TOO MUCH OF IT THOUGH PERFECTLY WITHIN THE RULES AT THE TIME DID STRIKE OUTSIDERS AS DISHONOURABLE JUST NOT RIGHT THE FACT IS THAT LAWS THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR CURBING THE WORST EXCESSES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH A GREAT DEAL IS INEVITABLY LEFT INDIVIDUAL JUDGEMENT TO OUR CONSCIENCE IF YOU LIKE
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE LAW BASED RULE DOMINATED SOCIETY IS THAT IT CAN SET UP A MENTALITY OF WHAT WE CAN GET AWAY WITH RATHER THAN DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR ITS OWN SAKE
RULES HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED AND THEY CAN OFTEN BE STRETCH VERY FAR INDEED IN THE DIRECTION OF FURTHERING OUR OWN OR CORPORATE INTERESTS AS WE SEE IN THE AREA OF TAX AVOIDANCE
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO JOIN A GOOD BUSINESS OR A SOUND PROFESSION SOON FIND THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES TO BAY THERE IS A CERTAIN ETHOS IN WHICH SOME THINGS ARE JUST NOT DONE THERE IS A KIND OF MORAL MILIEU OR VALUE SOAKED ENVIRONMENT WHICH THEY BREATHE IN AS PART OF THEIR WORKING LIFE AND WHICH SHAPES THEY'RE OUTLAWS
AND THIS RECORDS WITH A TREND IN MORAL PHILOSOPHY IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING OF A SWING AGAINST MORALITY SEEN IN TERMS OF RULES TO ONE THAT ARISES OUT OF THE KIND OF PERSON WE ARE AND IT'S REFLECTED IN CERTAIN VIRTUES
CERTAINLY MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE APPROVED FOR HER CRITERIA ABOUT PEOPLE WAS ALWAYS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD WHAT SHE CALLED A NICE CHARACTER
THIS MEANS EXAMINING HOW AN ACTION MIGHT LOOK TO A VERY DEEP HERSELF KNOWING HOW PRONE WE ART HERSELF TO SECTION AND HOW EASY IT IS TO FOOL OURSELVES
WE COULD ALSO ASK I'D LOOK TO THE PEOPLE WE MOST RESPECT AND FOR A RELIGIOUS BELIEVER THIS IS ALL PART OF LAYING OURSELVES OPEN IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD PRAYER BOOK TO THE ONE TO WHOM ALL HEARTS ARE OPEN ALL DESIRES KNOWN AND FROM WHOM NO SECRETS ARE HID
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH BISHOP RICHARD HARRIES THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT DAY AFTER DAY THE CASE FOR BRITAIN REMAINING IN THE Y. U. IS BEING MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER FROM WHO RAN TO BE CONSERVATIVE LEADER AS A EURO SCEPTIC HE HAS WRIST LOOKING RATHER LONELY AT TIMES TODAY ONE OF HIS PREDECESSORS JOINS THE FRAY A FORMER PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO HIM AND I ASKED HIM HOW WORRIED HE WAS ABOUT HOW THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WAS GOING
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD CHOICE AND POLITICS AS A HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE BUSINESS PARTICULARLY TODAY ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE SENSIBLE AND
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE GYRATIONS ON THERE
CURRENCY MARKETS THE ONE THING THAT IS FOR SURE IS IF YOU VOTE TO GO THERE ARE GOING TO BE SEVERAL YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY AND IN MY VIEW THAT UNCERTAINTY WILL BE MULTIPLIED BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A WHOLE SET OF QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE U.K.
CONSEQUENT ON A DECISION OF THE U.K. TO LEAVE EUROPE THAT WILL ADD TO THAT UNCERTAINTY UNCERTAINTIES
I THINK IN THE END THIS THIS REFERENDUM WILL BE ONE FOR THOSE THAT SEE BRITAIN REMAINING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT ACTUALLY YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE A REFERENDUM LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY WITH THE THE FURTHER
ON THE EMPTY SIDE AND NOT BE CONCERNED SO I AM CONCERNED BUT I BELIEVE IN THE END WE WILL VOTE TO STAY TIME FOR SOME FURTHER ON THE PRO SIDE TIME FOR TONY BLAIR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
I KNOW WEATHER'S TIME IT'S THE RIGHT CLUB MEAL ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT DISTANCE AND THAT THAT CARRIES WITH THAT NEGATIVES AS WELL AS POSITIVES BUT I THINK IT'S
IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ARGUE THIS CASE FOR EUROPE WITH WITH SOME
BECAUSE THE FACT IS IF YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME MOST FRUSTRATING ABOUT THIS IS BRITS GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD IN EUROPE BRITAIN SO IT'S A GREAT COUNTRY TO STRONG COUNTRIES A STRONG ECONOMY IT'S GOT ACTUALLY
IN PERSON FOR PERSON IT'S IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE OF SYSTEMS AND IN THE BRITISH POLITICAL SYSTEM
PRETTY GOOD SYSTEM I SEE THEM SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD TODAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST LIKE IT OR DON'T LIKE
ASPECTS OF IT AND DESTINIES ARE COUNTRIES THE LEAD IN EUROPE AND WE CAN AND WE SHOULD AND ONCE THIS IS OUT OF THE WAY WITH WITH WITH SOME STRONG LEADERSHIP IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WE WILL BUT
WE'VE GOT TO REALISE THE HOW FAST THE WORLD IS CHANGING HOW IMPORTANT THIS RELATIONSHIP IS AND THE MASSIVE INSTABILITY THIS CAKE TO COME
THE NO GOOD PURPOSE IF WE IF WE TAKE THE WRONG DECISION DO YOU NOT THINK THAT MAYBE THE PUBLIC ARE MINDED TO PUNISH YOU
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF WHAT THEY SEE IS THE POLITICAL ELITE THEY THINK YOU WERE WRONG IN THE REASSURANCES YOU GAVE ABOUT YOU HAVE YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THE EURO YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT MIGRATION FROM EASTERN EUROPE AND THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT
THE POLITICAL CLASS A HALL HAS GOT TO GET UP AND STAND UP FOR ITSELF IN THE CENTRE GROUND OF PARTICULARS GOT TO GET SOME MORE MUSCULARITY AND ITS POSITION WOULD BE BILL GOT ABOUT BEARD ELITES WANT EUROPE WITH THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE PENNY OF ELITE'S ON THAT
ANTI EUROPEAN SIDE RENE THE POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHO ARE DRIVING THIS AND OTHERS WHO ARE MAJOR POLITICIANS WHO ARE FIGHTING THIS CASE BUT NO LESS ELITIST THAN ANY OF THE POLITICIANS ON THE OTHER SIDE THE QUESTIONS WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE
AND IN A BRITAIN HAS GAINED FROM EUROPE OVER THIS THE THESE LOST DECADES YES OF COURSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES AND DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN EUROPE BUT YOU COMPARE
WHERE BRITAIN IS TODAY AND WHERE WE WERE FORTY YEARS AGO
WHAT ARE PEOPLE REALLY SAYING THAT THIS IS ALL BEEN ONE WAY IT'S BEEN BAD FOR BRITAIN BRITAIN HAS GAINED ENORMOUSLY FROM BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE WORLD THAT'S DEVELOPING TODAY IT'S NOT TO SATISFY SOME MAKE LEAT THAT WE SHOULD BE PART OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL UNION BIGGEST COMMERCIAL MARKET IN THE WORLD IS PRECISELY TO SATISFY THE INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE THERE WAS INTEREST THAT WILL BE
DAMAGED FUNDAMENTALLY NOT THE ELITES BY THE WAY SUPPORTING THIS CASE TO GET OUT OF EUROPE THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DAMAGED WITH THE INSTABILITY AND THAT AND THAT ECONOMIC DIFFICULTY THAT'S GOING TO BE CONSEQUENT WON A DECISION TO WITHDRAW SO MIGHT THIS IS FRAMING THIS ARGUMENT AT THE WAY THESE GUYS DOING THE ELITES ARE ALL FOR EUROPE AND THE PEOPLE ARE ALL AGAINST IT COME ON
YOU GUYS ARE JUST THE LEADERS AS ANYBODY ELSE THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT PRO EUROPEAN SIDE GO OUT THERE WITH A BIT OF PASSION AND VIGOUR AND DETERMINATION AND STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE NOT JUST AS A AS A MATTER OF ECONOMIC REALISM BUT AS A MATTER OF OF POLITICAL IDEALISM
YOU JUST DID TONY BLAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED O.K.

GOOD MORNING IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE ELEVENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SAYS IT'S OUTRAGEOUS TO VIEW PEOPLE WHO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT MASS IMMIGRATION HAS RACISTS
FRANK COMMENTS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY ARE PROMPTED THE WHITE HOUSE TO SAY DEEPLY VALUES A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. LABOUR IS PROMISING TO MANAGE THE PUBLIC FINANCES WITH IRON DISCIPLINE IF IT RETURNS TO POWER AND CEREMONIES HAVE BEEN HELD IN JAPAN TO MARK THE MOMENT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS HIT BY A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ THIS MORNING BICEPS OPENS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY IS DESCRIBED AS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS ANY MOVES TO CONDEMN AS RACIST PEOPLE WHO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ARRIVAL OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH PARLIAMENT'S HANS MAGAZINE IS IT WAS REASONABLE TO BE ANXIOUS AT A TIME OF WHAT HE CALLED SUCH COLOSSAL CRISIS ON THE ISSUE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE ABOUT WHAT BRITAIN DOES IN THE WORLD IS A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT
JUSTIN WELBY TREADS A CAREFUL LINE IN HIS COMMENTS ON THE REFERENDUM HE SAYS THAT IT'S VALET TO FEEL FEAR OVER THE RESULT OF THE BOAT WHETHER THAT'S FEAR OF WHAT HAPPENS IF BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. OR REMAINS WITHIN IT ASKED ABOUT THE REFUGEE CRISIS JUSTIN WILL BE TERMS IT'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THAT IT CAN ONLY BE HANDLED AT A EUROPEAN LEVEL SAYING THAT THE CURRENT WORK AT THE EUROPEAN SOLUTION WAS DEEPENING THE CRISIS SIGNIFICANTLY
HE ALSO SAYS THAT BRITISH PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO FEEL THE IMPACT OF THE INFLUX OF LARGE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS ON THE COMMUNITIES MIGHT HAVE AND THAT IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS TO CONDEMN THOSE WHO RAY SUCH CONCERNS AS RACIST THE ARCHBISHOP GOES ON TO SAY THAT BRITAIN NEEDS TO FIND WAYS OF TAKING ITS SHARE OF REFUGEES AND THAT THE TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIANS ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT LOOKS REALLY RATHER THIN COMPARED WITH THAT MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE TAKEN BY GERMANY LAST YEAR
WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH IS A PROMINENT AND CAMPAIGNER IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM TOLD AS THE ARCHBISHOP HAD MADE SOME RATIONAL COMMENTS ON IMMIGRATION BUT SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT MUCH EARLIER
FAR TOO MANY YEARS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT IN A SENSE THE ELITES REALLY HAVE ALL SAID IT'S TERRIBLE TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION IF YOU DO YOU'RE RACIST SO THEY SHUT DOWN THE DEBATE FOR MANY MANY YEARS BUT THAT ACCUSATION PROBABLY SILENCE LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION AND IT MEANT THAT IF YOU DO THAT WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU PUSH THIS DEBATE TO THE MARGINS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN EUROPE
TONY BLAIR HAS URGED SUPPORTERS OF THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO ARGUE THEIR CASE WITH PASSION VIGOUR AND DETERMINATION HE TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FERVOUR DISPLAYED BY THOSE WHO WANT BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN GROUP DESCRIBED MY BLAIR AS HAVING MADE EMPTY PROMISES OF REFORM WITH REGARD TO THE E.U. WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SOUGHT TO SMOOTH RELATIONS WITH THE U.K. AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA CRITICISED BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN A MAGAZINE INTERVIEW MY OBAMA SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD ALLOWED LIBYA TO BECOME A MESS FOLLOWING THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE WHITE HOUSE LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT PRAISING DAVID CAMERON AS A NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOPER REPORTS
THIS UNSOLICITED STATEMENTS SENT TO ME BY A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN SEEMS TO SHOW THE ADMINISTRATION IN SERIOUS DAMAGE LIMITATION MODE NED PRICE SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL PRAISE DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP IN NATO AND ARE MEETING THEIR COMMITMENT TO SPEND TWO PERCENT OF NATIONAL INCOME ON DEFENCE
BUT THIS COMES AFTER CRITICAL COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT LINKING AMERICA'S INITIAL RETICENCE TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA TO DAVID CAMERON'S FAILURE TO SECURE A PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY FOR AIR STRIKES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN IT IS INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT BLAMED BRITAIN AND FRANCE FOR THE CHAOS THAT NOW REIGNS IN LIBYA AND SHOWED THE FURY FELT IN WASHINGTON THAT BRITAIN HAS IN RECENT YEARS CONSIDERED CUTTING DEFENCE SPENDING
LAST NIGHT DOWNING STREET RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING MY OBAMA HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE CLEAR THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS AMONG HIS CLOSEST PARTNERS
LABOUR IS SEEKING TO WIN BACK VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS ECONOMIC POLICIES BY ANNOUNCING IT WILL ABIDE BY WHAT IT'S CALLED A NEW FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE THE MEASURE BINDS ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE DAY TODAY SPENDING WITH THE AMOUNT IT RAISES IN TAXES THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL USE HER SPEECH IN LONDON TO SAY A LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY DISCIPLINED AND ONLY BORROW TO INVEST MORE DETAILS FROM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMMAND ARMOURED
IT IS A MAJOR ATTEMPT TO REPOSITION THE LABOUR PARTY ON THE ECONOMY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR SAYING THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT WING ABOUT EXCESSIVE SPENDING THE FISCAL CREDIBILITY RULE WILL OBLIGE ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND WHAT THE PARTY DESCRIBES HER DAY TO DAY SPENDING IT WILL ALLOW FOR BORROWING FOR INVESTMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUCH AS NEW ROADS AND RAILWAYS
JOHN MACDONALD TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT LABOUR HAD TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC DEBT WILL FALL UNDER A LABOUR GOVERNMENT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD
AND THEN FINALLY ALL THIS WILL BE SUPERVISED INDEPENDENTLY BY THE OFFERS A BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING DIRECTLY TO POWER THIS IS A NEW IRON DISCIPLINE FOR A LABOUR GOVERNMENT LABOUR SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED TO ME THAT A LACK OF ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY IS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS WHY PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE PARTY AT THE LAST ELECTION THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE SAID THAT ANY FUTURE LABOUR GOVERNMENT WOULD PUT THE PUBLIC FINANCES AT RISK
JAPAN IS MARKING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POWERFUL EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI THAT STRUCK THE COUNTRY'S NORTH EAST COAST KILLING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND CAUSING MELTDOWN AT THE FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR PLANT A MOMENT OF SILENCE WAS HELD AT THE EXACT TIME THE QUAKE STRUCK A CORRESPONDENT RUPERT WINFIELD HALES IS IN RECORDS AND TALK AT WHICH IS TAKING DRASTIC STEPS TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM ANY FUTURE DISASTER
NO
A PRAYER FOR THE DEAD NEXT TO A LONE PINE TREE THE ONLY ONE TO SURVIVE THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN
THE TOWN OF REPRESENT HER CUTTER WAS ONCE FAMOUS FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL BEEF SIDE PINE FOREST FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS WIPED OUT ALONG WITH EIGHTY PER CENT OF THIS
MORE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE KILLED HERE ALMOST EVERY FAMILY LOST SOMEONE NOW A HUGE NEW TSUNAMI WALL IS BEING BUILT MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS THE OLD ONE THE WHOLE CITY CENTRE IS BEING BURIED UNDER MILLIONS OF TONS OF ROCK AND SOIL
RAISING ITS LEVEL BY MORE THAN FORTY FEET IT IS HUGE AND EXPENSIVE AND WILL TAKE TEN YEARS TO FINISH BUT THE SURVIVORS HERE ARE DETERMINED THAT SUCH A DISASTER WILL NEVER AGAIN BEFALL THIS CITY
THE REMAINING FOUR CANDIDATES HOPING TO SECURE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THE FACED EACH OTHER IN A TELEVISED DEBATE IN FLORIDA IT TOOK PLACE JUST DAYS BEFORE THE PRIMARY ELECTION THERE AND IN A HIGHER LAURA BAKER REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON
THIS WAS NOT THE KIND OF REPUBLICAN DEBATE VIEWERS HAVE BEEN USED TO THERE WERE NO JOKES NO INSULTS IT EVEN SURPRISED THE USUALLY BOMBASTIC FRONT RUNNER DONALD TRUMP WHO REMARKED AT HOSTS SEVERAL IT WAS ON STAGE IT WAS THE FINAL CHANCE FOR THE FLORIDA SENATOR MARKLE RIBBY AUTUMN PRESS BEFORE THE CRUCIAL VOTE IN HIS HOME STATE NEXT WEEK HE CHALLENGED THE BILLIONAIRE FOR ASSERTING THAT ISLAM HEATS THE U.S. AND SAID HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT
HE WAS INTERESTED IN BEING CORRECT THE TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUISE LYING SECOND IN THIS RACE ALSO TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT THE GAP AND DONALD TRUMP'S POLICY ASSERTIONS SAYING IT SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH TO YELL CHINA BAD MISS
AFTER WEEKS OF CHAOS THE CALM OF THIS DEBATE FEELS LIKE A REPUBLICAN PARTY TRYING TO GET ITS HOUSE IN ORDER
A STUDY SAYS PLANTING TREES AROUND RIVERS COULD REDUCE THE HEIGHT OF FLOODING IN TOWNS DOWNSTREAM THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FLOOD PREVENTION IN ENGLAND MINISTERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE TREES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY ALONG WITH IMPROVE DEFENCES AND MORE DREDGING ONE OF THEIR RESEARCHERS DOCTOR SIMON DIXON FROM BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY TOLD US TREES INTERRUPTS THE FLOW OF WATER
THEY CREATE A MORE COMPLEX LAND SURFACE SO WE'VE GOT SOME TREE ROOTS AND FAWN AND WOOD AND A DEEP SOIL IN MEANS THAT THE WATER TRANSFERS SLOWER INTO THE RIVER AND THEN WHEN IT GETS INTO THE RIVER FORESTS GENERATE NATURAL LOG JAM AND LOTS OF COMPLEXITY IN THE CHANNEL AND DURING FLOOD EVENTS THIS PUSHES WATER OUT ONTO THE FLOOD PLAIN
SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE HAVING RAISED LEVELS OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS GOOD CHOLESTEROL CAN LEAD TO A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF HEART DISEASE RESEARCHERS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY SAY THEY'RE FINDING APPLIED TO PEOPLE WITH A RARE GENETIC MUTATION THE DETAILS MY HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER
THE SO CALLED GOOD CHOLESTEROL PARTICLES HIGH DENSITY LIPO PROTEIN OR H.D.L. TRANSPORT FATTY MOLECULES TO THE LIVER SO THEY COULD BE ELIMINATED FROM THE BODY FOR MOST PEOPLE RAISED LEVELS OF H.D.L. THEREFORE SUGGEST A LOWER RISK OF HEART DISEASE
BUT THIS WORK PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE SHOWS THAT IN PATIENTS WITH A RARE GENETIC FAULT AFFECTING AROUND ONE AND SEVENTEEN HUNDRED OF THE POPULATION THE NORMAL CLEARING FUNCTION OF H. D. L. IS BLOCKED SO DESPITE ITS STRONG PRESENCE THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD A FAR HIGHER RISK OF HEART DISEASE EQUIVALENT TO THE RAISED RISK PRESENTED BY SMOKING THE CAMBRIDGE SCIENTISTS SAY THEY BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT HOW H.D.L. WORKS IN THE BODY COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO NEW TREATMENTS TO HELP PROTECT THE HEART
A NUMBER OF ANIMALS BIRDS AND INSECTS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON BRITAIN'S COASTLINE THE NATIONAL TRUST HAS VOLUNTEERS RECORDED MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SPECIES AT TWENTY FIVE SITES IN ITS LARGEST EVER WILDLIFE SURVEY THE RARE FOREST CHAFER BEETLE WAS FOUND AT WHITE PARK BAY IN COUNTY ANTRIM THE FIRST RECORDED SIGHTING IN NORTHERN IRELAND FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY
THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT WHEN POLLSTERS ASK US WHAT IS THE TOP OF OUR LIST OF CONCERNS WE SAY IMMIGRATION MANY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE NATION INTO THEIR OWN LIVES
NOW THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY HAS ADDED HIS VOICE TO THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE HOW DO YOU SOME PRETTY POWERFUL LANGUAGE HE SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT BRITAIN HAS A GENUINE AND JUSTIFIED FEAR OF MASS IMMIGRATION AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS TO DISMISS THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNS AS RACIST I'VE BEEN TALKING TO IAN DUNCAN SMITH WHO WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OUTER CAMPAIGN IN THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM BUT FIRST HIS THOUGHTS ON THOSE COMMENTS FROM DOCTOR WELBY
I THINK THIS IS THESE ARE RATIONAL COMMENTS FROM THE ARCHBISHOP THERE TO BE WELCOMED BUT YOU WONDER JUST HOW MANY THEY'VE COME FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS SO I CONGRATULATE HIM BUT IF YOU THINK BACK AND YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS IS A MUCH AS I DO FOR FAR TOO MANY YEARS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT
IN A SENSE THE ELITES REALLY HAVE ALL SAID IT'S TERRIBLE TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION IF YOU DO YOU'RE RACIST SO THEY SHUT DOWN THE DEBATE FOR MANY MANY YEARS I CAN EVEN REMEMBER YOU KNOW BACK AT THE TIME AND TONY BLAIR WAS PRIME MINISTER TO EVEN MENTION IMMIGRATIONS TO BE ACCUSED OF BEING A RACIST YOU TALKED IN TERMS ABOUT ASYLUM SEEKERS EVER THAT ACCUSATION PROBABLY SILENCE LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION AND IT MEANT THAT IF YOU DO THAT WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU PUSH THIS DEBATE TO THE MARGINS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN EUROPE
AND THEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND PEOPLE WITH VERY POOR INTENTIONS AND RATHER NASTY MOTIVES THEN START TO TAKE THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S WHERE YOU LOSE CONTROL SO THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE MANY MANY YEARS BEFORE THAT SHUTTING IT DOWN HAS BEEN TERRIBLE FOR THE RICH PEOPLE ISN'T THERE A DANGER THAT SAYING WHAT HE HAS SAID USING THE VERY STRONG LANGUAGE THAT HE HAS USED PEOPLE MIGHT INFER FROM THAT THAT HE IS AGAINST IMMIGRATION NO AGAIN THIS IS THE OTHER THING APART FROM BEING ACCUSED OF BEING A RACIST THEN YOU'RE TOLD YOU'RE AGAINST MIGRATION
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS PERSONAL VIEWS ARE BUT I KNOW WHAT MINE ARE AND MANY LIKE ME WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM THAT YOU FACE IS NOT MIGRATION IT'S UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION IT'S WHEN PEOPLE IN VILLAGES AND TOWNS FEEL THAT YOU KNOW THEIR SCHOOLS AND THEIR HOSPITALS ARE PUT UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM A CONTROLLED MIGRATION AND THAT MEANS BASICALLY THEN PEOPLE HAVE TIME
GET USED TO PEOPLE TO ASSIMILATE WHEN THEY COME IN AND THEY REALISED THEN IF THEY'RE COMING IN A CONTROLLED WAY THAT THEY BRING TALENTS AND SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO THAT COMMUNITY AFTER ALL THE U.K. IS BUILT UP OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE COMING IN AT DIFFERENT PERIODS BUT THE KEY THING IS TO CONTROL THAT PROCESS OF COMING IN SO THAT ASSIMILATION DOESN'T BURDENS OF COST AND ALSO STIR UP HATREDS AND YOU SEE HIM AROUND THE WORLD WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN GERMANY WERE SUDDENLY THE UNCONTROLLED
MOVEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS CHAOS AT THE BORDERS OR GREASE AS PEOPLE COMING INTO SUDDEN GERMANY HAS CALLED ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS THE ARCHBISHOP HAS ENTERED THE MIGRATION DEBATE TONY BLAIR HAS RE ENTERED THE REFERENDUM DEBATE HERE SAID THE ONE THING AN INTERVIEW WITH US HE IS THE ONE THING IS FOR SURE THAT IF YOU VOTE TO LEAVE THERE WILL BE SEVERAL YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT ISN'T HE
WELL I DON'T ACTUALLY AGREE I THINK WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ABOUT VOTING TO LEAVE IS THAT THE U.K. EXPRESSES ITS OPINION THAT IT DOESN'T WANT TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT YOU THEN HAVE TO DO QUITE IMMEDIATELY IS YOU'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES AND DISCUSS THE FORM OF THE NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSIONS TO TAKE THE U.K. OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT OF COURSE
THE PRINCIPAL POSITION YOU WANT AND THEY WILL WANT TO BUY THE WAY IS TO HAVE A BALANCED AND SETTLE PROCESS WHERE WHY YOU CONTINUE TO TRADE AND CO OPERATE ON MANY ISSUES HE MIGHT WANT TO CO OPERATE MORE AND MUCH ON THE ENVIRONMENT YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO CO OPERATE ON A NEED TO DO WITH DEFENCE AT SUCH A WHERE THERE ARE SUCH CO OPERATIONS THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS YOU DO AS FRIENDS
WE WILL REMAIN AS FRIENDS THAT'S THE KEY THING AND WE WILL CO OPERATE SO THE IDEA THAT IF YOU LEAVE YOU HAVE CHAOS THE TRUTH IS IF YOU STAY YOU WERE FAR LESS CERTAIN AND FAR MORE UNDER THREAT ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT THIS STAGE OF THE CAMPAIGN AREN'T YOU BEGINNING TO REGRET THE EMPHASIS YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING ENDLESSLY YOUR SIDE OF THE OUTERS ON WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS PROJECT FEAR ON THE PART OF THE INNERS IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE TERRIBLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ISN'T IT
JOHN I THINK THE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THING IS FRANKLY THE KIND OF ASSERTIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE BY THOSE WHO WANT TO REMAIN IN THEIR ALMOST PANICKY REALLY I I LISTEN TO THESE ENDLESS COMMENTS AND SPEECHES ABOUT THAT DIRE WARNINGS THERE ALMOST BIBLICAL YOU KNOW SUSPECTS A PLAGUE OF FROGS IN THE DEATH OF THE FIRSTBORN I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS WE DO IT IS THERE SO I THINK FOR EXAMPLE YESTERDAY THE ASSERTION IMMEDIATELY THAT THREE MILLION JOBS DEPEND ON TRADE WITH EUROPE
THREE MILLION JOBS ARE GOING TO GO WHY WOULD THEY GO WHY WOULD ANY COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WANT TO CEASE TRADING WITH THE U.K. WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO STOP GERMANY DOES EXPORTING HUGE NUMBERS AND MACHINE TOOLS CARS AT SUCH A PREFERABLE YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID WHAT THEY'RE OVER TERRIBLE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER I DON'T KNOW ON THIS BUSINESS IS ALL SHUT WE WOULD KNOW WHAT I MEAN COME ON HOW DO YOU KNOW LET'S TAKE IT ONE SECOND
WE HAVE THE AUTUMN STATEMENT IN DECEMBER ALL RIGHT AND WE WERE TOLD IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS THINGS WERE LOOKING GREAT WITHIN ONE MONTH OF THAT FORECAST WE'RE NOW BEING TOLD THAT THINGS ARE DIFFICULT AND THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND THEREFORE WE HAVE TO RIVER REVISE THAT WHAT MIND THAT PROCESS ALL I SAY TO YOU JOHN IS IF YOU CAN'T FORECAST MORE THAN TWO MONTHS HOW IN HEAVEN'S NAME CAN YOU FORECAST THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT IF WE LEAVE THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF CERTAINTY THAT IS THE REALITY YOU CAN'T
POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE LEAVE HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO RENEGOTIATE TREATIES AND ALL THE REST YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW THAT FOR VERY OBVIOUS REASONS WE'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE NO THERE'S LIKELY TO BE PUT UP HER PERIODS OF UNCERTAINTY OVER ISSUES AS I SAID EARLIER ON YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT MIGRATION CRISIS AT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT'S GOING I MEAN I THINK THE PROPOSALS ARE RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW ANOTHER SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE EUROPEAN UNION FROM TURKEY YOU'VE GOT THIS OTHER ISSUE HERE OF OF
THAT CHAOS AND COLLAPSE OF THE EURO WE KNOW THAT ITALIAN BANKS NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY INSOLVENT AND THEY'RE TEETERING ON THE BRINK WE'VE GOT GREECE READY TO COME BACK WITH HIS BEGGING BOWL IN REAL DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS MOST OF EUROPE NOW HERE'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A PERIOD OF CONCERN I HAVE A MASSIVE CONCERT IF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS SO VITAL TO JOBS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE GOING TO LOSE JOBS IF THAT'S THE CASE WHY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FRANCE SPAIN
ITALY GREECE DO THEY HAVE SOME OF THE WORST YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT RATES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD WHILE IN THE EUROPEAN DUTY I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHY COS I'VE BEEN RIGHT AT THE HEART OF IT BECAUSE WE DOMESTICALLY IN THE U.K. HAVE CHOSEN IN THE AREAS THAT ARE OURS TO RULE SUCH AS WELFARE REFORM
WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A MASSIVE WELFARE OF FORESIGHT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THAT WE'RE IN THE EUROPEAN FROM THE SITE HERE IS MY POINT HERE IS THAT IF IT WAS ABOUT SIMPLE ACCESS TO THE TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND THAT WOULD CAUSE PROBLEMS THEN EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY IN EUROPE WILL HAVE INCREDIBLE EMPLOYMENT THEY WOULD HAVE NO YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT THE REALITY IS JOHN WE ARE TIED TO AN ORGANISATION THAT IS PRETTY SCLEROTIC AND MY VIEW IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED US
THROUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN A GLOBAL TRADE ON WAS HANG ON THAT WAS I DON'T SUPPOSE WELL ANSWERED A SURPLUS AND OUR DOMESTIC TRADE AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR A DOMESTIC TRADE IS THAT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COMPANIES IN THE U.K. WHO DO KNOW TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE FORCED TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT CAUSED THEM REAL DIFFICULTY AND PROBLEM I'M OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE I'M COMPLETELY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE FOR ONE VERY GOOD REASON
THE U.K. IS BY NATURE A TRADING NATION IS BY NATURE A GLOBAL TRADING NATION IT STILL DOES THE VAST MAJORITY OF ITS TRADE OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE WANT TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE THAT WE WANT TRADE DEALS WITH LIKE AMERICA AND INDIA AND THE FACT IS IF WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE DON'T HAVE TO BE A PART OF IT WE'RE NOT IN THE SHINGLE AGREEMENT WHICH WAS A VITALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE E.U. STRUCTURE WIN NOT IN THE EURO BECAUSE WE CHOSE NOT TO BE
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS YOU SAY SO WE HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS NO BECAUSE WE GET THE EFFECTS DIRECTLY OF VOTES ARE TAKEN WE HAVE NO ABILITY WE'VE JUST GIVEN AWAY OUR RIGHT TO VETO ANY OF THE CHANGES THAT TAKE PLACE FROM WITHIN THE EURO WHICH WILL AFFECT US THAT MEANS THAT IN ESSENCE THAT WAS THROWN AWAY FOR NEXT TO NOTHING AND THAT HAS REAL BEARING ON US AS TAKE THE SHAKING AN AREA YES WE'RE OUTSIDE THE SHOWING AN AREA
BUT WITH ALL OF THE NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS COMING INTO EUROPE MANY OF WHOM WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY COME FROM OR WHAT THEIR MOTIVE IS AS WE SAW WITH THE PARIS BOMBINGS IT'S NOT BEYOND THE WIT OF MAN TO KNOW THAT WITHIN A REASONABLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME MANY OF THOSE WILL BE GIVEN LEAVE TO REMAIN IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES THE LARGE NUMBER NO DOUBT WILL BE GIVEN PASSPORTS AS THEIR SETTLE OTHERWISE IT'LL BE TERRIBLE FOR THEM AND THEN OF COURSE THEY WILL HAVE COMPLETE AND FREE ACCESS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM MY POINT IS BEING OUT OF SHOWING AND IS ONLY A SMALL IMITATION COMPARED
TO WHAT BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BRINGS ONE OF THE VERY IMPORTANT AND IT IS THIS WHAT WE FAILED TO DISCUSS AT EVERY TIME IS THAT WE HAND OVER SOMETHING LIKE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO THE EUROPEAN UNION MOST OF THAT GOES TO PROJECTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A WEEK WE WILL BRING BACK TO THE U.K. THAT'S EQUIPMENT OF BUILDING A HOSPITAL
A WEEK ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HERE AND WE THROWED NEXT NEARLY TWENTY BILLION POUNDS AWAY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION I AM COMING OUT THERE'S I WHAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER TO GET RID OF THE GOVERNMENT AND TO RETAIN THEIR OWN MONEY TO SPEND ON PROJECTS LIKE HOSPITALS THAT THEY NEED FOR THEMSELVES DON'T ARGUE ABOUT THE FIGURES THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT AT SOME FUTURE POINT GAME IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU
IT'S TWENTY PAST EIGHT NOW IT'S A MESS I WAS DRAGGED IN BY THE EUROPEANS HAVE THEY TOOK THEIR EYE OFF THE BALL THEY HAVE A HABIT OF CALLING ON US TO DO MORE BUT THEN NOT DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE THAT IS A ROUGH SUMMARY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S UNGUARDED REMARKS IN A MAGAZINE INTERVIEW ABOUT MILITARY ACTION IN LIBYA AND ITS AFTERMATH IT ALL SEEM TO BEGIN SO WELL WITH THE FALL OF COLONEL GADDAFI
FORTY YEARS OF TOURING AS LEFT LIBYA FRACTURE AND WITHOUT STRONG CIVIL INSTITUTIONS THE TRANSITION TO EIGHT WERE GENTLEMEN GOVERNMENT BIT AS RESPONSIVE TO LIBYAN PEOPLE WILL BE A DIFFICULT TASK AND WHILE THE UNITED STATES WILL DO OUR PART TO HELP IT WILL BE A TASK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUTE
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A TEST FOR THE LIBYAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES
YOUR FRIENDS IN BRITAIN AND IN FRANCE WILL STAND WITH YOU AS YOU BUILD YOUR DEMOCRACY AT BUILD YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE FUTURE
DAVID CAMERON SPEAKING AT HEAVIER TIME'S IN BENGHAZI IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN JOINED NOW BY JOHN SO PLUM NORTH AMERICA EDITOR IS BRIEFLY OVER HERE WITH A SKIRT COULD SEE JOHN AND SIR RICHARD DOULTON FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA AS WELL
RONNIE BUT FURY SOUNDS AS IF IT IS BEING UNBURDENED IN PUBLIC JOHN IT IS ALMOST AS THIS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEFT OFFICE AND HE'S DOING HIS SORT OF REFLECTIVE INTERVIEWS OF HIS TIME IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN POWER AND KIND OF BEING FAR TOO COUNTED ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW HE SUDDENLY SORT OF BEING VERY OPEN AND THIS SORT OF NORMAL CIPHERS AND CODES ARE NOT THERE HE'S SAYING CANDIDLY WHAT HE THINKS SOME OF IT WE KNEW SOME OF IT WE HAD HEARD
OFF THE RECORD I'M SURE YOU HAD NICK WHEN YOU WERE DOING THE DOWNING STREET BEAT I HAD AT THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT DEFENCE SPENDING IT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS THAT IT WAS MAINTAINED ABOUT CERTAIN OTHER FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT EUROPE AT THE COUNTER WITH WHICH HE SAID IT AND THEN LAST NIGHT I WAS CONTACTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE
NO I HADN'T ASKED FOR A COMMENT THEY SUDDENLY GO I GOT GOT AN EMAIL IN MY INBOX SAYING OH NO NO NO EVERYTHING'S FINE EVERYTHING'S ABSOLUTELY O.K. WE REALLY WELL VALUE BRITAIN AND THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP AND IT WAS YOU COULD FILL THE REVERSE THRUST BUTTON HAD BEEN PRESSED PROBABLY AFTER A PHONE CALL FROM DOWNING STREET WHAT ON EARTH HAS HE JUST SAID HE WAS EH YOU HAD NAILS FOR A CUPBOARD BUT NO DOUBT SOMEBODY AT NUMBER TEN HAD THE THAT THING THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE OBSESS WITH AND OBSESS ABOUT SO MUCH
ON THIS SIDE OF THE POND IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR REASSURANCE IS IN DOWNING STREET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT IT'S STILL INTACT YES THEY ARE AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS AT A DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT AND THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO LONDON WAS SPEAKING AT IT AND HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE KIND A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN REPORTEDLY IN CRISIS AND WAS OVER AND THAT ACTUALLY IT HAD NEVER BEEN OVER IT WOULD ALWAYS COME BACK IT IS
PECULIARLY BRITISH OBSESSION THAT THE AMERICANS KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE BRITISH SWEET WITH AND SO I'M SURE THAT THE AMBASSADOR WOULD THINK WELL THIS IS JUST A SMALL HICCUP IN THE WAY AND PROBABLY DOESN'T ACTUALLY MERIT EVEN BEING INCLUDING HIS NEXT LIST OF CRISES IN THERE BUT IT IS IN THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BUT I THINK IT DOES SHOW
THE REAL STRESSES AND STRAINS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA AND DAVID CAMERON PARTICULARLY ON THESE BIG FOREIGN POLICY QUESTIONS JOHN'S OVER THANK YOU SIR RICHARD OPEN LISTENING AS I SAID A FORMER BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA DID YOUR EYEBROWS REACH TOWARDS THE CEILING WHEN YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT'S COMMONS WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISING
I THINK THAT HE MADE ONE KEY REMARK ABOUT LIBYA WHICH WAS THAT THE STRUCTURES WHICH WERE EMERGING AFTER THE FALL OF
COULD A FEE WITH WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BRITAIN FRANCE NIGHT STATE COULD CO OPERATE WEREN'T SUSTAINED BY THE LIBYAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES IN OTHER WORDS THE REMARK THAT HE MADE ALTHOUGH
FREE WITH RESPECT TO HIS REGRETS ALSO CONTAINED THE REAL GERM OF TRUTH WHICH IS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GAVE THE LIBYANS THEIR OPPORTUNITY AND THE LIBYANS WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE IT THROUGH THEY BLEW IT AND THEY BLEW IT THROUGH THE KIND OF INTERNAL DISUNITY WHICH OBAMA REFERRED TO
IN THAT COMMENT IN WHICH BEFORE THE EVENT HE WISELY SAID HOW DIFFICULT THAT IT WOULD BE SO WHY HE WAS RELUCTANT ISN'T IT WE KNOW THAT IN EFFECT HE WAS DROWNED BY THE BRITISH BY THE FRENCH BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT INTO DOING SOMETHING HE WAS RELUCTANT TO DO AND SURELY FOR A FAIRLY OBVIOUS REASON AFTER A RACK WHICH IS IT'S EASY TO BOMB AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES AFTERWARDS ABSOLUTELY AND I DIDN'T SEE IN THE INTERVIEW IN THE ATLANTIC ANY
REAL APPRECIATION OF THE TRAUMATIC EFFECT ON THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND THUS ON PARLIAMENT IN ITS WILLINGNESS TO INTERVENE IN SECURITY SITUATIONS OVERSEAS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ THE AMERICANS AND THE BLAIR GOVERNMENT HAVE LEFT AND
DREADFUL STAIN ON THE ABILITY OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE TO GIVE THAT KIND OF AUTOMATIC TRUST THEIR GOVERNMENT ON OVERSEAS OPERATIONS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE IF YOU'RE TO RESPOND RAPIDLY TO CRISIS SITUATION THE OTHER COULD PRESENCE COMMONS ARE LOOKING BACKWARDS BUT AS YOU LOOK FORWARD DO YOU THINK THESE DISAGREEMENTS MEAN THAT THE WEST SIMPLY DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE TERRIBLE MESS THAT LIBYA IS NOW IN
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND AT THE SAME TIME I SYMPATHISE WITH THE WISH OF THE EUROPEANS TO HAVE A CLEAR LEGITIMATE REQUEST FROM A PROPER ORGANISATION IN LIBYA BEFORE IT INTERVENES
HONOUR SIGNIFICANT SCALE SO WE KNOW THAT PREPARATIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR THE KIND OF INTERVENTION TO HELP THE LIBYANS CONTAIN ISLAMIC STATE IN LIBYA IS TRANSLATE INTERVENTION IF YOU WOULD WHAT DEGREE OF MILITARY WHAT WE'RE READING IN THE MEDIA IS THAT THE ITALIANS I THINKING OF LEAVING A FORCE OF AT LEAST FIVE THOUSAND TO TRY AND TRAIN A LEGITIMATE
GOVERNMENT'S LEGITIMATE FORCES TO ASSIST WITH THE CONTAINMENT OF ISLAMIC
STATE WE'RE NOT GETTING MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THAT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WHERE I I RELISH OBAMA'S OPENNESS MANY OF HIS DECISIONS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WE DO NEED A MORE OPEN DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE WEST'S OPTIONS IN LIBYANS IN LIBYA NOW ARE SO THE ARGUMENT ABOUT HISTORY REALLY DOES MATTER FOR DECISIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN QUITE SOON SIR RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US
THANK YOU IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST THAT HERE'S ROBERT SPORT THEY SHONE HELLO AGAIN WE'LL TUNE IN FOR LIVERPOOL AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED IN LAST NIGHT'S EUROPA LEAGUE FIRST LEG TIRED ANFIELD THAT THERE'S ALBERT RATHER UNDERPLAYED LIVERPOOL'S DOMINANCE AND WHICH OWED MUCH TO THE SHARP REACTIONS OF UNITED GOALKEEPER DAVID TO HARE WHOSE PERFORMANCE WAS DESCRIBED AFTERWARDS FANTASTIC BY HIS MANAGER LOUISE I'M HARD BUT WHAT OF LIVERPOOL'S PERFORMANCE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR MANAGER YOU CAN CLOCK
ABSOLUTELY DESERVED IT WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE WON FOR US UNTIL OUR SECOND SO IT'S OF THE FIRST LIKE WE KNOW THIS BUT WE NEED TO WIN IT AND WE DID IT IT'S ALL THERE

AND WE WANT TO GO TO THE NEXT ROUND AND FOR THIS WE HAVE TO PLAY AGAIN LIKE THIS HAVE MANCHESTER WELL OUR FORMER LIVERPOOL PLAYER RAY HAPPENS ON THE LINE
WE THINK HE'S ON THE LINE THESE HELLO GOOD O. KAY WRITE A SIMPLE QUESTION TO YOU IS TO LIKELY DO YOU THINK TO BE ENOUGH TO TAKE LIVERPOOL THROUGH AFTER NEXT WEEK SECOND LEG
MUCH A SNAKE YOU CAN REALLY
IN THE SECOND LEG IN THERE BUT I WANT TO DO THAT ONE GO IT WOULD MEAN MAGISTRATE YOU UP THE SCHOOL AND I JUST HOPE YOU DON'T DO IT WE WERE PLAYING AT THE MINUTE YES TRUE ENOUGH THERE WAS AN ENERGY AND A DRIVE WASN'T THERE ABOUT LIVERPOOL YOUR CLUB'S FAMOUS DECOMPRESSING STRATEGY UNIT YOUR SENSES ARE BY NO MEANS THE FINISHED ARTICLE AND THE CLUB WELL A LOT AT THE MOMENT BUT YOU COULD SAY THAT MORE BETWEEN THE MANCHESTER UNITED WERE WEREN'T YOU KNOW THE AD ORCHESTRATE DIRECT DIDN'T YOU COULD CHILL
YOU KNOW THE CLAY WITH A VERY YOUNG FORWARD LAYING WE WERE ASHFORD IN MEMPHIS AND THEN THESE YOUNG CUTE YOU PEEL THAT VERY SORRY PROBABLY COS YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO EXPERIENCE OH PIPPY HELP THEM ALONG THE WAY IMAGES WERE COMPLETELY LOST ON THE NIGHT AS WE USED TO WEAR A LIVERPOOL SHIRT LET'S TALK ON THE CLOCK YOUR SON YOU SEE YEAH YOU LIKE THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE KNOT
I'LL BE REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE THE PLAYERS BUT YOU DON'T RING HIM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TOILET AND A FINAL BRIEF THOUGHT IF YOU WILL GRAHAM IN NO SENSE WAS THAT THE DIFFERENT EUROPEAN CONTEXT LESSEN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE TWO CLUBS RIVALRY LAST NIGHT OH WHAT
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT RIVALS MANCHESTER IN THE LATE I COULD BE A SEEDED ALL THE WAY THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED ONE ELSEWHERE AN ABSENCE OF SUPPORT FROM ANDY MURRAY FOR MARIA SHARAPOVA FOLLOWING HER POSITIVE DRUGS TEST HE SAID SHE SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCEPT HER SUSPENSION AND HE HAD THIS IN RESPONSE TO THE DECISION OF EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS HEAD TO EXTEND THEIR PONG SPONSORSHIP CONTRACT WITH HER
I THINK IT'S A STRANGE STAND GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I MIGHT BELIEVE AND REALLY I THINK AT THIS STAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET ALL
THE FAT AND THAT THINGS CLAIRE LET MORE INFORMATION COME OUT BEFORE MAKING A DECISION TO EXTEND THE CONTRACT LIKE THAT MIGHT HAVE YOU
AND THERE'S ADDED SIGNIFICANCE IN THAT GIVEN MARIE'S OWN CONNECTIONS WITH HIT SO THEN TO THE RACING TIPS WHAT TODAY THEY LEFT AT THREE TWENTY FIVE NUMBER TWO TOBY LORA HOOD AND I JUST LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M OFFICER CREASES ME UP AND SAY YOU'RE JUST MEANT TO SAY THAT WELL NO MATE NO MAYBE JOHN I JUST HAVE A VERY INFANTILE SENSE OF HUMOUR THE SPREADS ABOUT THREE FIFTY IS THE OTHER ONE NUMBER FIVE SUIT YOURSELF JOHN
AFTER THAT NEWS ABOUT MANCHESTER UNITED FOR GLI ANYTHING I NEEDED TO CHEER ME UP AT THE MOMENT IT'S A TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE AND AT NINE O'CLOCK UP READY FOR MORE STORIES BEHIND THOSE DISCS WASHED UP ON ANOTHER DESERT ISLAND
MY CASTAWAY THIS WEEK IS THE NUCLEAR ENGINEER DOCTOR DAME SUE IAN
HER PASSION FOR SCIENCE STARTED IN CHILDHOOD CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS ON THE FAMILY KITCHEN TABLE HER FAVOURITE TESTS WILL COME AS NO SURPRISE
THE ONES THAT MADE THE SMELLS AND ONES THAT WHERE YOU PUT THINGS IN WATER AND MOOD AND GROW INTO CRYSTAL OH YES AND THINGS THAT CHANGE COLOUR THINGS THAT FIZZED AND BACK
IAN MY CASTAWAY ON A DESERT ISLAND DISCS THIS MORNING AT NINE
AND THE WEATHER GOING TO BE CLOUDY WITH SUNNY SPELLS AND SOME RAIN FURTHER NORTH TODAY BUT IT IS GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT BETTER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND BE MOWING HIS LAWN IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JOHN HUMPHRYS
NICK ROBINSON AND CEPS HYMNS AS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY JUSTIN WELBY SAYS IT IS OUTRAGEOUS TO CONDEMN AS RACIST PEOPLE WHO FEAR MASS IMMIGRATION IS THERE'S THE SCALE OF THE MIGRANT CRISIS MEANS THEIR CONCERNS ARE GENUINE THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE COUNTRY HAD TO BE CONTROLLED TO AVOID STIRRING UP HATRED
OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON OR PLAYED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CRITICISM OF BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY INSISTING THE U.S. DEEPLY VALUES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.K. MY OBAMA ACCUSED BRITAIN AND FRANCE HAVE LEAVING LIBYA IN A MESS BY FAILING TO DO MORE IN THE FOLLOW UP TO THE MILITARY INTERVENTION
LABOUR IS PROMISING IT WILL SHOW AN IRON DISCIPLINE IN ITS MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES IF IT IS RETURNED TO GOVERNMENT THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL WILL SAYING THAT THE PARTY WILL CUT DEBT AND BORROW ONLY TO INVEST
A MOMENT OF SILENCE HAS BEEN HELD IN JAPAN TO MARK THE EXACT TIME FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI WIPED OUT COMMUNITIES AND CAUSED A MELTDOWN OF THE FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR PLANT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE FLOODS TO THE BLIGHTED SO MANY COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE
TREES LOTS MORE TREES PLANTING THEM NATURE'S ANSWER IT'S CLAIMED TO THE RISING OF THE WATER'S ENVIRONMENT AGENCY HAS BEEN PLANTING TREES ON HILLS IN TODD BUT IN CALDERDALE WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LANDSLIP DUE TO FLOODING STEVE DUNCAN IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION FOR COLD
IN TOG TOG AND IN PARTICULAR THE OF THE NUMBER OF HOUSES IN THE AREAS THAT GET AFFECTED BY THE FLOODS THE THE MEASURED TO ACTUALLY PLANT TREES IN IN THAT AREA IT'S HOPED THE BADGE ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN THE WATER AND HOPEFULLY PROTECT THE HOUSES A BIT MORE
WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED AS AN ORGANISATION FOR FLOODS NOW AND I THINK BECAUSE OF THE LOT THE BUILDING THAT'S GONE ON I THINK YOU KNOW SORT OF PLANTING TREES THIS IS A REALLY GOOD GOOD WAY OF ACTUALLY HELPING TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE ISSUES I'VE JOINED NOW BY SIR JAMES BEVAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY MORNING TO YOU SIR JAMES IT SOUNDS LIKE A SIMPLE PIECE OF ADVICE POMMEL TREES ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT
WELL IN DECEMBER I WAS UP IN THE NORTH AND INCLUDING IN CALDERDALE AND I SAW FOR MYSELF THE DAMAGE AND THE HEARTBREAK THAT FLOODING CAUSES SO I'M VERY CLEAR THAT IN AN ERA OF MORE EXTREME WEATHER WE NEED TO FOCUS ON BETTER PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY AGAINST FLOODING IS AN ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY AND TO DO THAT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK IMAGINATIVELY AT ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS WE CAN REDUCE FLOOD RISK AND THAT MEANS
UPSTREAM PATRICK MANAGEMENT TOO HARD FLOOD DEFENCES TO BETTER RESILIENCE WHEN FLOODING DOES HAPPEN AND IT WILL BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GUARANTEE PROTECTION AGAINST SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK WITH NATURE NOT AGAINST IT AND WE DO NEED TO USE THE KIND OF NATURAL FLOOD DEFENCES THAT WE'RE FEATURING TODAY LIKE TREE PLANTING AS PART OF THE MIX
MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK WE NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER AS A NATION BECAUSE FLOOD DEFENCE IS NOT JUST A MATTER FOR THE GOVERNMENT OR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THE VERY BEST OUTCOMES I THINK WE HAVE TO INVOLVE EVERYBODY WITH AN INTEREST IN THAT HAS TO START WITH A LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES I'M LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY TO YOUR WORDS LOOKING A MANSION OF THREE VELY SORRY LOOKING IMAGINATIVELY IT ALL OPTIONS PART OF THE MIX SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT WILL MAYBE HAVE ONE OR TWO PLACES BUT FRANKLY PLANTING TREES IS NO PANACEA AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE A BIG PART OF A SOLUTION
WELL I'M INTERESTED IN ALL ALL ELEMENTS THAT CAN HELP US OR BETTER PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY AGAINST FLOODING AND I'M LITERALLY BIT SPECIFIC THAT YOU DREW THEIR PLANS TO PLANT A LOT MORE TREES
WE ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS COS WE FUNDED THE STUDY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO WE ARE SUPPORTING THEIR RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT WE SUPPORT MANY PROJECTS ARE ALREADY GOING AHEAD I'M PLANTING TREES AND IN FACT I WAS UP IN THE PEAK DISTRICT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO LOOKING AT ONE WHICH IS PLANTING TREES ON CURRENTLY BEAR MORE LAND
THAT IS HAVING A HUGE BENEFIT IN TERMS NOT JUST MAKING THE COUNTRYSIDE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND THE COUNTRYSIDE MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR FOR WILDLIFE IT'S IT'S IT IS HAVING A FLOOD RISK BENEFIT SO WHAT'S THE DOWN SUNLIGHT FOR YOU PRESUMABLY IT'S THAT IF YOU PLANT TREES ON A MOOR LAND OR GRASSLAND THAT MAYBE MONEY THAT FARMERS HAVE THEY'RE NOT GETTING FOR TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
I THINK I REGARD FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS AS AS PARTNERS NOT NOT PROBLEMS IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THAT WE FACE IN TERMS OF FLOOD OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES WE NEED TO WORK WITH FARMERS AND WITH LANDOWNERS TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE SCHEME THAT I REFER TO MOMENT GOES A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN DESIGNED WITH LOCAL FARMERS IN THE PEAK DISTRICT
AS WELL AS USE THEIR LAND AND AS WELL AS BENEFITING ADAIR ROUEN IN THE WIDER AREA BECAUSE OF THE FLOOD DEFENCE BENEFITS AND AS WELL AS BENEFITING ALL THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA WHO RECEIVE WATER FROM THAT PART OF THE WORLD BECAUSE IT WHEN YOU DO THIS THIS PROGRAMME YOU CAN ALSO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY IT ACTUALLY BENEFITS THE FARMERS THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT CREATES GREATER SHELTER FOR THEIR OWN CATTLE THAT'S BROUGHT THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY JUST TO BROADEN HIS MINISTERS WERE TOLD BEFORE THE LATEST ROUND OF FLOODS
THE CUTS TO YOUR FLOOD MAINTENANCE BUDGET'S ABOUT FORTY PERCENT AND THINK WOULD LEAVE TWICE AS MANY HOUSEHOLDS AT RISK OF SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT FLOODING OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES NOW IT THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU BACK UP DO YOU AGREE AND IN PRIVATE ARE YOU SAYING TO MINISTERS CARRY ON AS WE ARE THINGS GET WORSE
I DON'T RECOGNISE THE NUMBERS AND THE THRUST OF THE QUESTIONS WRONG BECAUSE THE FACT IS THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY SPENDING MORE MONEY ON FLOOD DEFENCE AND WE HAVE DONE BEFORE WE'VE GOT I SAID FULL OF DEFENCE HER MAIN TOWNS FOR FLOOD DEFENCE MANGE DIFFERENTLY IF YOU JUST LET ME OUT OF THE QUESTION IT WE WE'RE SPENDING TWO POINT THREE BILLION POUNDS ON FLOOD DEFENCE OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO SIX YEARS IN TERMS OF CREATING NEW NEW DEFENCES THAT PROTECTS AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSES AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID
IS THAT WILL PROTECT IN REAL TERMS THAT THE VALUE OF THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND ON MAINTAINING HER EXISTING FLOOD DEFENCES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THIS PARLIAMENT WOULDN'T LISTENERS BE MORE REASSURED IF YOU WERE IN PRIVATE AND A ROW MINISTERS ABOUT SPENDING MORE RATHER THAN IN PUBLIC DEFENDING THEM FOR SPENDING ENOUGH
I HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH MINISTERIAL TEAM LIZ TRUST THE ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY IT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER I'M NOT I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY IN PRIVATE YOU KNOW TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS IN PRIVATE BUT I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT IN TERMS OF OUR RESOURCE THAT MOMENT AND ONE JOB ONE LAST GOOD FOR HIM WITH ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES OUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR A LITTLE EARLIER WHEN THE FLOODWATERS BEGIN TO RISE WHAT WILL BE BETTER AS A RESULT OF WHAT YOU WERE THERE ARGUED FOR
THAN HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO
I THINK IF WE GET THIS RIGHT OVER THERE NOT JUST OVER THE NEXT YEAR BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL HAVE BETTER WAYS OF MANAGING FLOODS UPSTREAM SO WAYS THAT SLOW THE FLOW SO THE WATER DOESN'T COME DOWN AS QUICKLY AND AFFECT COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE EVEN MORE AND EVEN BETTER HARD FLOOD DEFENCES TO PROTECT THOUSANDS MORE PEOPLE AND WHATEVER NATION THAT IS MORE RESILIENT AS AND WHEN FLOODING HAPPENED SO JAMES NEVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY TWO IF WE WANT TO HAVE EFFECTIVE JABS AGAINST FOR INSTANCE FLEW WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT MAKES THE VIRUSES MUTATE HOW THEY MANAGED TO KEEP DOING IT AND THAT MEANS CARRYING OUT EXPERIMENTS IN LAB TO GETTING THEM TO MUTATE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AS IT WERE BUT SOME SAY THAT HE'S DANGEROUS IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVELY BANNED IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IS THE LAST DAY FOR THAT MORATORIUM TO BE LIFTED AND I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO PROFESSOR JOHN OXFORD WHO IS ONE OF THE LEADING EXPERTS IN FLU AND EXCUSE ME
SUCH VIRUSES GOOD MORNING TO YOU YES GOOD MORNING IS THAT RIGHT OVER SIMPLIFIED OR MEAT YOU HAVE TO STUDY THESE VIRUSES AND YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS TO THEM TO GET THEM TO MUTATE YES IT'S CALLED IT'S CALLED GAME HAVE FUNCTIONED AS THAT'S WHAT THE SO CALLED EXPERTS CALL IT AND IT IS REALLY BASICALLY TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE LAWS OF NATURE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS OUT THERE IN NATURE
WHY WHY EVERY EVERY TEN YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS DO YOU GET A HUGE PANDEMIC A NEW VIRUS Y. AND AND AND KIND OF HOW DOES IT HAPPEN IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE THE ROAD MAP YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE IT GETS TO IT'S GOING TO GO BEFORE IT LAUNCHES ITSELF OFF MAYBE WE COULD HAVE AMMUNITION IN A POCKET TO STOP IT DOING THAT THAT THE DANGER IS THAT YOU CREATE A NEW MUTATION AND THAT MUTATION IS EITHER USED BY TERRORISTS OR IT ESCAPES FROM THE LABAN CAUSES MAYHEM
THAT IS ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT BUT LET ME LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY NO ONE IS PLAYING AT GOD HERE I MEAN IT MIGHT MAKE TWO COLLEAGUES ROLF YUSEF AND YOSHI KARAOKE ARE PROPERLY AT THE HEART OF THIS DEBATE IN WASHINGTON COS THEY WERE THE PEOPLE WHO STARTED THIS OFF THEY ARE NOT SAYING IT GOD AND NEITHER ARE THEY DOCTOR STRANGELOVE BUT THEY ARE CREATING A NEW PATIENT NO NO THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HE SAID THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A DEADLY VIRUS
THEY'RE CHOPPED NOT TRYING TO CREATE WHAT THEY TRYING TO LOOK OUT TO SEE HOW A VIRUS LIKE BIRD FLU SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE FAIRLY INNOCUOUSLY AT THE MOMENT WHAT EXTRA DOES IT NEED HOW MANY MAJOR PATIENCE DOES THAT MARTIANS H. FIVE BEFORE IT'S NOT SPREADING FROM PERSON TO PERSON ATTACKING HUMANS IT CAN ATTACK HUMANS NOW AND IT DOES AND KILL SOME WITH QUITE A HIGH DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY BUT IT WILL IT CANNOT DO IS SPREAD
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED I'LL SAY ONE THING THIS GAME FUNCTION NOTHING IS FOR NOTHING IN THIS WORLD AND YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME RISK YOU KNOW IF YOU LIKE THAT I WOULD RISK IT IF THAT VIRUS IF YOU ME TAKE THAT PART AND HE BECOMES MORE SPREADABLE SUCH GAIN SOMETHING WAS GOING TO LOSE SOMETHING AND WE KNOW ALREADY WHAT IT'S GOING TO LEWIS'S CAN BECOME LESS DEADLY
ICY DEADLY IT IS SAID THAT IN TWO THOUSAND WON THEY CREATED AM I RIGHT ABOUT THIS AIRBORNE BIRD FLU THEY MADE DID ABLE TO INFECT HUMANS MEAN THAT IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DID THEY DID MUTATION IN THE LABORATORY UNDER UNPRETTY AWFULLY DANGEROUS WELL IT'S A PRETTY SAFE LABORATORY I SAY PRETTY SAFE WITH THIS IS ACTUALLY
IT IS A SAFE LABORATORY AND THEY ARE EXPERTS THE PAIR OF THEM THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT BLOW INS AS IT WERE THERE NOT NOVICES EITHER OF THEM I CAN TELL YOU THAT SO THEY DID THAT EXPERIMENT AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIMENT TO TELL US SINGS BUT HE DID TELL US WHICH MUTATIONS ALLOW THE VIRUS TO SPREAD BUT THEN WHEN THEY LOOKED IN NATURE
THEY FOUND VIRUSES THAT WERE ALREADY THERE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECT SO THEY DIDN'T CREATE ANY FULL OF FERRARI THERE WHY DO THEY HAVE TO CREATE ANYTHING NEW WELL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND NOW WE HAD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOR MUTATIONS FOR MUTATIONS ARE ALL THAT'S NEEDED WE THINK TO ENABLE AND INFLUENTIAL LIKE BIRD FLU TO START SPREADING FROM PERSON TO PERSON THAT IS VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION INTI AND FOR A GROUP OF MORATORIUM PEOPLE JUST COME ALONG SAY WILL YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUBLISH THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DID SAY
OF TWO OF THOSE YEARS AGO OH NO WE DON'T THAT PUBLISHED YOU CAN'T PUBLISH THAT AND THEN HE'S COME ALONG SAY WILL STOP ALL THE WORK SEEMS SHE'S A TERRIBLE THING THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE SUN IT'S OPERA RIGHT WELL I WILL TAKE YOU ON THAT BUT YOU WANT THE MORATORIUM PRIVY BE LIFTED I CERTAINLY DO I'VE GOT HUGE RESPECT FOR THEM I DON'T THEM TO BE LIKE JULIUS CAESAR EVERYONE TURN YOU ON THEM WAS STABBING IN THE BACK UNLESS ALMOST LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE AT THE MOMENT PROFESSOR OXFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE
