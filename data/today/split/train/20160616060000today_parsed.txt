WITH THE GOVERNMENT PREPARING A NEW DRUG STRATEGY THIS IS A BOLD AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE THE REPORT SAYS CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FAILED TO DETER ILLEGAL DRUG USE UNDERMINED PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES AND MAY ACT AS A BARRIER TO ADDICTS COMING FORWARD FOR HELP
IT CALLS FOR A SEA CHANGE IN APPROACH AND SAYS THE U.K. SHOULD ADOPT THE PORTUGUESE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH PEOPLE CAUGHT USING DRUGS OFFERED TREATMENT AND SUPPORT RATHER THAN BEING PUNISHED THOUGH DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS WOULD STILL BE PROSECUTED THE HOME OFFICE HAS DEFENDED ITS RECORD SAYING DRUG MISUSE HAS DECLINED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALEX IT'S NOW COMING UP TO EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS NO SURPRISE IT IS VARIOUS CLAIMS IN ME Y. A EU REFERENDUM STORY ON MANY OF THE FRONT PAGES THE TIMES THEY PICKED UP ON THIS STUDY ABOUT OR RELEASE COMMENTS ABOUT DRUG USE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ALL DRUGS SHOULD BE DECRIMINALISED ACCORDING TO THEM AND WHAT THE TIMES DESCRIBES AS A LANDMARK INTERVENTION AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SERIOUS BODIES LIKE THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE FACULTY OF PUBLIC HEALTH
THEY SAY THAT THEIR LAWS FAILING TO PROTECT DRUG USERS OR SOCIETY AND POLICE INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TAKING MUST END THEY SAID EVEN THINGS LIKE HEROIN AND COCAINE AS WELL AS CANNABIS LEGAL HIGHS SHOULD BE DE CRIMINALISED AND THEY SAY POSSESSING DRUGS OR PERSONAL USE WOULD NO LONGER BE PUNISHABLE UNDER THE REFORMS THEY'RE PROPOSING THEY DO SAY THAT ANYONE MAKING OR DEALING DRUGS WOULD STILL
FACE PROSECUTION AND THEY SUGGEST THAT THE N.H.S. SHOULD TAKE OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEALING WITH ADDICTS THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS FAILED SAYS THE CHIEF EXEC TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S TIME THE TIME HAS COME FOR A NEW APPROACH WHERE WE RECOGNISE DRUG USE IS A HEALTH ISSUE THE CLOSER WE GET TO REFERENDUM DAY IT IS AFTER ALL ONLY SEVEN DAYS AWAY THE MORE THE PAPERS SHOW THEIR OWN COLOURS THE FINANCIAL TIMES IN ITS EDITORIAL TODAY SAYS THE VOTE MUST BE REMAIN BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. SAYS ITS EDITORIAL
WOULD BE A GRATUITOUS ACT OF SELF HARM AND BACKING UP THAT VIEW IS THEIR FRONT PAGE STORY THE HEADLINE BLUE CHIPS THREATENED TO SUE LEAVE CAMP OVER LEAFLET AT THAT USED LOW GOES THIS IS THE HEADS OF GENERAL ELECTRIC UNILEVER AND AIRBUS WHO'VE WRITTEN TO VOTE LEAVE CLAIMING THAT THEIR LOGO SHOULD NOT HAVE APPEARED FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES ON VOTE LEAVE LITERATURE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN
THE DAILY MAIL CONTINUES TO TRY AND GET IMMIGRATION ONTO EACH FROM PAGE EACH AND EVERY DAY IT DOES SO WITH A VERY STRIKING PICTURE OF SOME EVIDENCE FOUND IN THE BACK OF A LORRY SITTING IN A FAMILY WITH THEIR CHILDREN ON THE BACK OF BOXES WE'RE FROM EUROPE LETTERS IN AS THE HEADLINE THAT IS WHAT THE ELEVEN STOWAWAYS FOUND BY POLICE IN EAST LONDON APPARENTLY SAID AS THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY CUSTOMS OFFICERS AND GOOD OLD RUTH CLEMENS HURT HAS APPEARS IN A NUMBER OF PAPERS SHE'S TRYING TO SHAME A HIGH STREET STORE IN THIS CASE H. AND M. BECAUSE SHE
WENT AND TRIED ON A PAIR OF SIZE FOURTEEN SIXTEEN JEANS RATHER EXPECTING THEM TO BE TOO BIG FOR HER COS SHE'S A SIZE FOURTEEN AND SHE'S TAKEN HERSELF FREE OF THE RESULT THEY'RE WAY TOO SMALL FOR HER AND SHE POINTS OUT THE ABSURDITY OF SOME OF THE SIZING IN SHOPS AND HER POSTING ON FACEBOOK HAS GONE VIRAL AND HAS BEEN PICKED UP WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF SPORT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE NOT JUST WOMEN OF COURSE AND IT'S BEEN PICKED UP IN ALL THE PAPERS IT IS NOW TEN PAST SIX
IT WAS MEANT TO BE A FESTIVAL OF FOOTBALL TODAY WAS MEANT TO BE A HIGHLIGHT AS ENGLAND MEET WALES' EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN A MATCH THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN LAWNS IN FRANCE LATER THIS AFTERNOON IT ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING THE FOCUS IS ON TROUBLE OFF THE PITCH AT LEAST THIRTY SIX PEOPLE ARRESTED IN THE NEARBY FRENCH CITY OF LILLE HOME FOR THE NIGHT TO RUSSIAN AND SORT OF VACUUM FANS AS WELL AS THOSE GATHERING FROM ENGLAND AND WALES
DURING THE DAY A GROUP OF SEVERAL HUNDRED HUNDRED ENGLAND FANS WERE DRINKING LOCAL BARS AND CHANTING PLEASE DON'T SEND ME HOME AS NIGHT STARTED TO FALL BOTTLES WERE THROWN AT THE POLICE
AND THERE WAS A DRAMATIC ESCALATION INTENTIONS
REDS HAVE SUPPORTERS ENGAGED IN SCUFFLES WITH THE POLICE HE USED TEAR GAS FLASH BANGS AND BATS ON CHARGES TO DISPERSE THEM THE POLICE THEN SPENT MANY HOURS FUNNELLING MOSTLY ENGLAND FANS DOWN ON THE CITY STREETS OF THE B. B. C. DANNY SAVAGE REPORTED THE AIR IS THICK WITH TEAR GAS YOU CAN SMELL IT YOU CAN TASTE IT
THEY'RE COMING OUT THEM FROM ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES TO GET A LINE OF RIOT POLICE HEY GOT ANOTHER ONE HERE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE ENGLISH FANS ON THE MOVE
NOT A GOOD NIGHT FOR ENGLISH SUPPORTERS HERE IT DOESN'T PUT THEM IN A GOOD LIGHT AT ALL WILL BE TALKING TO THE HEADS OF THE ENGLISH AND WELSH F.A. IS LATER IN THE PROGRAMME ABOUT SECURITY ABOUT SUPPORTERS BEHAVIOUR AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE ABOUT SPORT AS WELL THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX POLICE DIVERS HAVE RECOVERED THE BODY OF THE TWO YEAR OLD HE WAS DRAGGED OFF BY AN ALLIGATOR IT DISNEYWORLD IN FLORIDA POLICE HAVE BEEN GIVING MORE DETAILS AS A LEMUR BULL TOLD ME
WELL ACTUALLY WHAT THE SHERIFF SAID WAS AT LEAST THEY DID FIND A BODY AT ONE STAGE BECAUSE THE SEARCH WAS GOING ON SO LONG THE SHERIFFS
HE DREADED THE FACT THAT EITHER THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIND A BODY OR I HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT STATE THE BODY WOULD BE IN AS IT HAPPENS
THE BODY OF TWO YEAR OLD LANE GRADES WAS FULLY INTACT AND VERY CLOSE TO WHERE HE WENT MISSING AND WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OR AT LEAST WHAT POLICE
BELIEVE HAPPENED WAS THAT THE TODDLER WAS JUST A FOOT OR SO INTO THE WATER
THEY THEY SAY AND HIS FATHER SUDDENLY HEARD SPLASHING TURNED AROUND AND SAW HIS IS TWO YEAR OLD SON IN THE JAWS OF AN ALLIGATOR AND LEAPT INTO THE WATER TRIED TO GRAB HIS SON
BUT WHILE HE DID GET INJURED HE WASN'T ABLE TO TO RETRIEVE HIS SON AND THE ALLIGATOR DRAGGED HIM AWAY SO A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THING FOR OUR FAMILY TO GO THROUGH
BUT AS I SAY AT THE POLICE AT LEAST FINDING THE BODY COULD AT LEAST BEGIN THE PROCESS OF SOME KIND OF CLOSURE
THE QUESTION A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING IS IS WHETHER ENOUGH WAS DONE TO TO WARN PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS THAT THERE ARE HERE THERE WAS APPARENTLY A SIGN WHICH SAID NO SWIMMING BUT NOTHING TO SAY THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ALLIGATORS INSIDE AND WE'VE HEARD NOW FROM EXECUTIVES FROM DISNEY WHO ARE VERY APOLOGETIC APPARENTLY THE SEA
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DISNEY HAS HAS CALLED THE FAMILY AND SOME IN THE AUTHORITIES WHO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO REVIEW THEIR GUIDELINES BUT THEY SAY THIS IS JUST A FREAK ACCIDENT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IT'S HAD THIS RESORT BUT THEY STILL SAY THEY'RE GOING TO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN
ALLY MC BALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FORTY MINUTES PAST SIX INTEREST RATES KEPT ON HOLD AGAIN BY THE AMERICAN FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ALWAYS THEY THE REAL INTEREST IS THE SPECULATION ABOUT WHY THEY TOOK THE DECISION AND WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT DOMINIC O'CONNELL IS HERE AS EVER TO TELL US ABOUT THAT AND THE REST OF THE BUSINESS NEWS MORNING DON THANK YOU NICK YES A RACE THIS IS BY THE FEEL RESERVE AS ONE OF THE BIG EVENTS FOR WORLD MARKETS
EVEN AS WIND AS WITH YESTERDAY WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS THE LANGUAGES BY JENNY ON THE FOOD'S GOING TO SCRUTINISE FOR ANY HINT ABOUT WHAT SHE REALLY THINKS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE U.S. ECONOMY IT'S A BIT LIKE CRIMINOLOGY AND THANKFULLY WE HAVE AN EXPERT ON HAND TO HELP US TO CODE WHAT WE'RE NOT I'M JOINED BY RANDALL CROSS A PROFESSOR AT CHICAGO UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER MEMBER OF THE FITS BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR YESTERDAY IN JENNY THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT DID YOU GLEAN FROM WHAT SHE SAID
THE FORMAL STATEMENT CHANGED VERY LITTLE IT SUGGESTED THAT MARKET IS NOT GROWING STRONGLY AS THE FOLK THAT HAVE BEEN GROWING STOOL THEY'RE NOT SEEM VERY MUCH PRESSURE IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF PRICES
AND SO IT LEFT THE OPTIONS OPEN WHICH IS SOMETHING THE FEATHERS LIKE TWO RECENTLY THEY WANT TO SEE HOW THE DATA GOING TO ABOVE BUT DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE I THINK SHE MADE IT FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE VERY GRADUALLY VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND SO THEY'RE IN NO HURRY TO START TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP UP THAT SLOWING JOBS MARKET IS THE IS THE KEY THING COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT WAY SO HE'LL BE ON THE MINDS OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS
I THINK FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE MIZ THERE'S A DUAL MANDATE OF THE FED TO KEEP INFLATION NEAR IT'S NEAR TO TARGET LEVEL OF AROUND TWO PER CENT AND THE SECOND IS TO HAVE HAVE MAXIMUM MORE GROWTH OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT GROWTH OF THE LAST FEW YEARS CREATING MORE THAN TEN MILLION JOBS SINCE THE END OF THE END OF THE RECESSION BUT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE SLY
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S NATURAL THAT ITS LINE WE'VE HAD THEM UP AND COME DOWN TO BELOW FIVE PERCENT THE U.S. JUST CAN'T CONTINUE TO CREATE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS FROM MOTHERED STIFF THING TO STEP DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL BUT THE FEDS SEEMS TO BE CONCERNED THAT IT'S SLIPPING ELMER SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL WAS JUST DIPPING DOWN TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE OR
THE FOOD CAN ALSO CHOOSE QUITE SUBTLE WAYS TO GUIDE PEOPLE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE AFTERWARDS THE FEARED GETS TO CHOOSE WHO ASKED THE FIRST QUESTION YESTERDAY SURPRISINGLY THEY ASKED THE BRITISH REPORTER AND NATURALLY THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT BRICKS IT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THE BY THE POLE AND THEY DIE CHOOSE THESE WAYS OF SENDING OUT MESSAGES
NO DOUBT THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS JENNY ELEMENTS EXPLICIT ON THAT AND MENTION MENTION BRECK'S IT AND THEY HAVE OFTEN BEEN TALKING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ALL THE CONCERNS THE IMPACT ON THE U.S. AS WELL AS ON THE WORLD ECONOMY AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT STEVE THEIR HAND DO YOU THINK PERHAPS TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT A BIT DO YOU THINK THE FIT WILL INCREASE RATES THIS YEAR
I THINK THAT THEY CERTAINLY IN THE FORECAST SO THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER MOTHER REET HI CAN I THINK IT'S QUITE REASONABLE THAT THEY WILL BE ENOUGH INFLATION PRESSURES TO SUGGEST THAT BUT I'M NOT SO SURE HOW QUICKLY THAT'S GOING TO COME TO THINK COULD PERHAPS BEAN MIXTURE
IT COULD PERHAPS BE NEXT YEAR I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO THINK THAT IT'S LIKELY ONE MORE READ HIKED LIKELY THIS YEAR BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT'S BROUGHT ON NEXT YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FRIEND ACROSS THE PROFESSOR AT CHICAGO BOTH AND A FORMER MEMBER
OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD WE TURN NOW TO ANOTHER BIT OF DRAMA FROM YESTERDAY B.H.S. AND ITS FORMER OWNER SIR PHILIP GREEN WHO HAD A TORRID TIME GIVING EVIDENCE TO HIM PEACE IN A MARATHON EVIDENCE SESSION YESTERDAY WE DID LEARN ONE THING THAT A THAT WANTS TO PUT MONEY INTO THE PENSION SCHEME WHICH HAS A DIFFS AT THAT COULD BE AS BIG AS FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS
THERE WAS A BIT OF A PRECIOUS LITTLE DETAIL AS TO HOW MUCH HE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE ALWYN WE'RE JOINED FROM NOTTINGHAM BY THE INDEPENDENT PENSIONS CONSULTANT JOHN RALPH WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE JOHN THAT SCHEME IS HEADED INTO THIS LIFEBOAT THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND IS SUE ANY PRECEDENT
FOR TAKING A SCHEME OUT OF THIS PROCESS AND HOW MIGHT SIR PHILIP DO IT IF WE WERE TEMPTED BUT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS DOMINIC BUT THAT'S ONLY IF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S IN THE VALUE OF THE ASSETS OF THE PENSION SCHEME HAS ENOUGH TO PAY THE PENSION PROTECTION FUND LEVEL OF COMPENSATION AND A LITTLE BIT MORE AND IF THAT HAPPENS A SCHEME COMES OUT OF THE P. P. F. AND THEN
BUYS A NEW IT ISN'T DEFERRED NEW IS FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS IN THIS CASE FOR TWENTY THOUSAND B.H.S. PENSION SCHEME MEMBERS HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE MAGIC NUMBER WHICH WHICH IT'S TABLE TO COME OUT OF THE P. P. F. BECAUSE THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY MORE TO MEMBERS THE MAGIC NUMBER FOR THE B.H.S. SCHEME IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THEN SIR PHILIPPA'S TALKED ABOUT PUTTING IN SO FAR
AND AND COULD HE DO SOMETHING SEPARATE OUTSIDE THE PEOPLE YOU COULD HE SET UP THE SIR PHILIP GREEN BENEVOLENT FOUNDATION TO PAY YOU KNOW EX GRATIA PAYMENT STOOD TO B.H.S. PENSIONS WITH THAT GET HIM OFF THE HOOK HE COULD CERTAINLY PUT SAY ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS INTO A SEPARATE ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULDN'T BE A PENSION SCHEME AT THE TROUBLE WITH THAT IS IT WOULDN'T LET HIM OFF THE HOOK THE PENSION PROTECTION FOOT WOULD STILL BE
LOSING THAT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION POUNDS AND THE PENSION REGULATOR WILL STILL WOULD STILL PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST GRAVITY AS A CONNECTED PARTY AND WE KNOW THAT THEY THEY'VE STARTED THAT PROCESS BECAUSE WE HEARD THAT AT THE SELECT COMMITTEE A FEW WEEKS AGO TUCKED EVITA IN THIS CASE BEING BIG BIT AT THE TOP COMPANY THE COMPANY THAT OWNED B.H.S.
INDEED WHAT YESTERDAY IN THE EVIDENCE SAFA SORT OF GAVE THIS IMPRESSION OF BEING SLIGHTLY DETACHED FROM THE PENSION FUND DID YOU THINK THAT WAS CREDIBLE AT ALL I FOUND THAT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT SIR PHILIP WASN'T IMMENSELY INTERESTED IN B.H.S. PENSIONS IN THE RISK THAT IT MIGHT POST OF THE BUSINESS HE SAID HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON RIGHT UNTIL TWENTY TWELVE
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WHEN WHEN HE WITHDREW FROM A POTENTIAL BID IN TWO THOUSAND FOR BUT HE BID FOR MARKS AND SPENCER'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR DOING THAT BUT ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WAS BECAUSE OF THE PENSION RISK THAT WAS INVOLVED IT'S ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TEN YEARS AGO
THE AUGUST FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTED THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT SELLING THE ARCADIA PENSION SCHEME THAT'S THE OTHER COMPANY IN THE IN THE TIBER TO GROUP THE SISTER COMPANY TO BE H. S. TO A BOY AND WHY WAS HE TRYING TO DO THAT AS THE FINANCIAL TIMES THAT IT WAS QUOTES TO TAKE THE RISK OF THE BALANCE TO TAKE THE RISK OFF THE BALANCE SHEET OF ARCADIA SO I THINK IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT SIR PHILIP DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT PENSIONS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN ROLFE THE INDEPENDENT PENSIONS CONSULTANT WE TURN NOW TO MARKETS AND WITH US IS RICHARD JEFFREY CHI FROM THIS MOSAIC OF CAPITAL MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING RICHARD WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS MORNING FROM FROM RANDALL ABOUT THE U.S. INTEREST RATE DECISION WHAT PARALLELS DO YOU SEE
WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND OF COURSE WE HAVE A BANK OF ENGLAND MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE ANNOUNCEMENT AT MIDDAY TODAY WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN WELL I SUPPOSE THE MOST OBVIOUS PARALLEL IS THAT WE DON'T EXPECT A GREAT CHANGE IN THE U.K. TODAY AND PROBABLY NOT NOT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I THINK THE INTERESTING COMPARISON BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE U.S. IS IN WHAT IS GOING ON IN LABOUR MARKETS
BRANDELL TALKED ABOUT THE U.S. LABOUR MARKET BEING PRETTY TIGHT ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT MIGHT BE SLOWER THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A FUNCTION OF REDUCING DEMAND YOU KAY HAS A SIMILAR SITUATION WE HAVE VERY INTERESTING LABOUR MARKET DATA PUBLISHED YESTERDAY A STRONG INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT AND DON'T FORGET THIS IS IN THE PRE BRECK'S IT IF YOU LIKE ALL THE PRE BRECHT'S IT REFERENDUM PERIOD
AT STRONG GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DIPPING TWO TO FIVE PER CENT VACANCES RISING SLIGHTLY THEY CONSIDER THAT A HIGHER LEVEL IN THE ECONOMY THEM BEFORE THE THEM BEFORE THAT THE RECESSION SOME SIGNS THAT AN AVERAGE EARNINGS GROWTH IS IS PICKING UP PARTICULARLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR WHERE IT'S VERY STRONG AT THE MOMENT AND WE KNOW THAT STRONG DEMAND FOR LABOUR SO
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. AND YOU LOOK AT THE U.K. THE QUESTION IS IS THERE BEGINNING TO BE SOME INFLATIONARY PRESSURE BUILDING UP IN IN THE LABOUR MARKET WHICH IS BEING IGNORED BY CENTRAL BANKS WHICH REALLY AT THIS AT THE MOMENT ARE STILL LOOKING FOR EXCUSES NOT TO CHANGE INTEREST RATES RATHER THAN THE MORE POSITIVE INTEREST REASONS WHY INTEREST RATES ARE GRADUALLY BEING EDGED UP NOW BECAUSE THE GROWTH BACKGROUND IS BECOMING MORE NORMAL SO FAR THIS YEAR THE M. P. C. HAS BEEN UNANIMOUS ABOUT KEEPING RATES ON HOLD
FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID THERE MUST BE WEIGHING IN THEIR MINDS THIS IDEA THAT INFLATION IS BUBBLING UNDER AND AT SOME STAGE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACT
I THINK AT SOME STAGE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACT AND THE RULE OF THUMB ALWAYS FOR CENTRAL BANKS IS THAT THE EARLIER YOU MOVE THEM THE LESS YOU HAVE TO MOVE EVENTUALLY AND THAT THE RISK IS THAT THEY GET AS THEY SAY BEHIND THE CURVES IN OTHER WORDS THE PROBLEMS BECOME VERY OBVIOUS IN THE PUBLISHED DATA WHICH POINT OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE BEHIND THE CURVE THEY'RE RUNNING TO CATCH UP AND THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO SEE INTEREST RATES RISE MORE QUICKLY AND POTENTIALLY TO A HIGHER LEVEL
RICHARD GEOFFREY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL ANOTHER DAY AND ANOTHER FOOTIE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY WRITING TO STAFF ABOUT BRICKS AT THIS TIME IT'S UNILEVER THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS GIANT THE MAKES HOUSEHOLD NAMES LIKE DOVE SOAP COLMAN'S MUSTARD AND BEN AND JERRY'S ICE CREAM

BENEFICIAL AS WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY BEING PART OF THE TRAINING BLOCK AND THAT CREATES ENORMOUS
COSTS AND THESE COST COSTIGAN MAKE TO U.K. LESS COMPETITIVE PUTTING HIM OR DROPS AT RISK SO THE EFFECTS OF LEAVING SUDDENLY FOR COMPANIES LIKE OURS AND OUR EXTEND THAT'S FELL YOU CHAIN WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF SMALLER COMPANIES AS WELL IT'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS
WHATEVER LUKE JOHNSON THE ENTREPRENEUR AND CHAIRMAN OF RISK CAPITAL PARTNERS SIS FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED BOSSES LIKE PULLMAN HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO
MOST OF THOSE WHO ARE OBSESSED ABOUT PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO BENEFIT FROM THE RIGID HAND OF THE STATE THAT THE E.U. REPRESENT SO THEY ARE BIG CORPORATIONS WERE ENTRENCHED
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE RED TAPE IT KEEPS OUT POP STARS THEY ARE THOSE WHO LIKE THE IDEA OF GOVERNMENT LARGESSE COMING FROM BRUSSELS SAY THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THE HUNDRED FORTY BILLION EUROS A YEAR BUDGET WHEREAS I THINK THOSE WHO BELIEVE
GENUINE FREE MARKET TO TRADE I THINK THAT THE E.U. IS A JOB DESTROY ANOTHER JOB CREATING MACHINE
THERE WAS THE ENTREPRENEUR LUKE JOHNSON WILL BE HEARING FROM ANOTHER PRO EXCEPT AT ENTREPRENEUR THE VETERAN INVESTOR GARY CLASH AFTER SEVEN A.M. ON THIS PROGRAMME

WERE TO WRECK THE ECONOMY
THE LABOUR LEADERS HAVE TEN OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST CITIES INCLUDING GLASGOW AND BIRMINGHAM HAVE WARMED IT BREAKS IT POSES A GRAVE THREAT TO THEIR ECONOMY IT'S LATER TODAY AT THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONALD AND THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF AND BROWN WERE TALK ABOUT HOW YOU FOUND THIS HAVE HELPED BRITISH CITIES BOAT LEAVE SET THE CITIES HAD PROSPERED IN SPITE OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP
FRENCH POLICE AND ENGLAND FOOTBALL FANS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FURTHER CLASHES IN THE FRENCH CITY OF LILLE THIRTY SIX PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED AND SIXTEEN OTHERS WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITAL THE REPAIRS THAT ENGLAND SECOND EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN GAME AGAINST WALES THIS AFTERNOON COULD BE OVERSHADOWED BY VIOLENCE
DIVERS HAVE FOUND THE BODY OF A TWO YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS KILLED BY AN ALLIGATOR AT WALT DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA THE CHART WAS DRAGGED INTO THE WATER WHILE PLAYING ON THE SHORE OF A LAGOON
TWO LEADING HEALTH ORGANISATIONS ARE CALLING FOR DRUG USE TO BE DECRIMINALISED IN THE U.K. THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE FACULTY ARE PUBLIC HEALTH SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S WAR ON DRUGS HAS FAILED AND THERE SHOULD BE MORE FOCUS ON TREATMENT AND DEDICATION BOOM OFFICE HAS DEFENDED ITS RECORD SAYING DRUG MISUSE HAS DECLINED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
THE THIRD WOMAN HAS ALLEGED SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED BY THEIR LATE LIBERAL M.P. AND BROADCASTER SIR CLEMENT FREUD VICKY HAYES WHO'S SIXTY FOUR SETS THE POLITICIAN RAPED OUT IN THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN
IT'S NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S GET MORE ON THAT CRITICISM OF THE TREASURY IN THE BANK OF ENGLAND FOR PEDDLING PHONEY FORECASTS TO FRIGHTEN THE ELECTORATE INTO VOTING TO STAY IN THE E.U. IT'S A CRITICISM FROM TWO FORMER CONSERVED LEADERS LEADERS AND TWO FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLORS ISIS AND POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH JOINS US ON THEY'VE WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE TELEGRAPH WITH THIS PRETTY SEVERE CRITICISM

WHAT WERE PREVIOUSLY IN A HIGHLY REGARDED INDEPENDENT ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN OUTWITH THE POLITICAL FRAY SO THEY SAY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE CIVIL SERVICE THE TREASURY OTHER OFFICIAL SOURCES THEY SAY OF THEM THEY ARE GUILTY OF QUOTES A WOEFUL FAILURE TO PRESENT A FAIR AND BALANCED ANALYSIS GRATING THEM HERE AT STARTLING DISHONESTY
PEDDLING PHONEY FORECASTS AT ONE LEVEL YOU CAN SAY WELL THIS IS PART OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGNS ATTEMPT TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AS SORT OF THE ANTI ESTABLISHMENT THE PEOPLE'S REVOLT TAKING ON THE COSSETED INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE AND ANOTHER LEVEL AND I THINK
WITHIN DOWNING STREET THIS IS CERTAINLY THE VIEW THERE IS MOUNTING ANXIETY ABOUT THE SORT OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE THIS IS DOING TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF BRITISH SOCIETY ONCE THIS IS ALL OVER AND UNDERMINING AS IT WERE PUBLIC TRUST IN ORGANISATIONS THE CIVIL SERVICE A TREASURE AND SO ON WHICH HAVE BEEN SORT OF BULL WALKS OF THE BRITISH POLITICAL SYSTEM
ANOTHER STORY WHICH IS AWAY FROM THE ECONOMY ON IMMIGRATION WHICH IS THE LATEST COMMENTS FROM THAT WELL EFFECTIVELY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO REMAINDERS GEORGE OSBORNE WHO SPOKE TO US YESTERDAY ABOUT NOT END NO PLANS TO SEEK NEW CONTROLS ON Y. YOU MUTT MIGRANTS BUT THERESA MAY SAYING SHE WANTS SOME CHANGE WELL GEORGE OSBORNE I THINK WAS
RESPONDING TO THE SPECIFIC SUGGESTION THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN WERE DESPERATELY SCAVENGING AROUND FOR SOME SORT OF DEAL THEY COULD PUT BEFORE THE ELECTORATE ON FREE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE REFERENDUM MISSUS MAY WAS SIGNALLING A MORE LONG TERM TAKE THAT DOWN THE LINE SHE WOULD HOPE TO SEE FURTHER REFORM
OF FREE MOVEMENT THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE IS THEY KNOW IMMIGRATION IS A HUGE AND SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BUT TRYING TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE THE REFERENDUM IS PRETTY MUCH MISSION IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY PART OF BEING IN THE SINGLE MARKET THE PART OF THE DEAL IS SIGNING UP TO FREE MOVEMENTS VERY UNLIKELY THEY GET ANY CONCESSIONS FROM OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES BEFORE WE VOTE
SO THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING FURTHER DO YOU THINK IN THE WEEK IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM AS A SIGN THAT LOOK WE REALLY ARE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE SOME CHANGES I THINK THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP HAMMERING ON THE ECONOMY AS THEY CORE MESSAGE AND THEY WILL KEEP GOING AND GOING ON THAT BECAUSE TO TRY AND PRESENT SOMETHING AT THE LAST MINUTE ON IMMIGRATION I THINK WOULD BE SEEN AS A WHEEZE I DON'T THINK THEY COULD SQUARE IT OFF WITH THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS MORE THAN THAT IT WOULD DISTRACT FROM THE CENTRAL MESSAGE ON THE ECONOMY ON THE SMITH WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO ANSWER YOUR PHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE COULD OFFER PRIZES REALLY FORGETTING WHICH SPIN DOCTOR OR WHICH POLITICIAN WHO WAS TRYING TO GET ALL THEIR ORGAN A SIX THERE BEFORE CONFESS IT'LL BE A SECRET WILL KEEP
PROMISE IT'S TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN MORE TROUBLE MORE ARRESTS MORE FOCUS ON THE FANS RATHER THAN WHAT HAPPENS ON THE PITCH THIS AFTERNOON WHEN OF COURSE ENGLAND WALES IN EUROS TWENTY SIXTEEN C. MCKEE TOUCH HAS BEEN ON THE STREETS OF LILLE FOREST SEEMA A FRIGHTENING PLACE TO BE I IMAGINE
YES JUST PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU NECK OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE YESTERDAY WE GOT HERE EARLY WE SPENT THE DAY ROAMING THE STREETS SPEAKING OF FANS AND AS THE DAY WENT ON THE VIOLENCE REALLY DID
ESCALATE THROUGHOUT THE DAY LARGE CROWDS OF ENGLAND FANS CHANTED OUTSIDE VARIOUS PUBS HERE THEY SANG THE SECOND WORLD WAR SONG TEN GERMAN BOMBERS A SONG THEY OFTEN SING AT TOURNAMENT
AS IT BECAME DARK THERE WERE FIGHTS BETWEEN GROUPS OF FANS AND POLICE AND JUST OUTSIDE THE CAFE WHERE WE ARE THIS MORNING
WE SAW TWO BRITISH FANS CHASE A COUPLE OF RUSSIAN FANS DOWN THE STREET THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY DOZENS OF RIOT POLICE WITH SHIELDS AND THEIR FANS HAD A SCUFFLE AND AT THIS POINT I WAS PUSHED BY BRITISH FAN WHO TOLD ME TO REPORT THE TRUTH I'M NOT BLAME THE ENGLISH FOR THE VIOLENCE
DON'T BLAME THE ENGLISH SEEM THEY BIG WORRY OF THE PLEASE WAS THAT IT CLASHES WITH THE RUSSIANS COS THEY PLAYED LAST NIGHT OF COURSE THE ENGLISH AND WELSH PLAYING TODAY YOU DESCRIBE SCUFFLES IT IN OTHER WORDS I DO YOU DON'T WANT AS ONE OF THE LITTLE THIS BUT HE'S NOT ON THE SCALE THAT PERHAPS WAS FEARED
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT BUT JUST BEING OUT AND ABOUT THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF FEAR FROM TOURISTS AND OTHER FANS SOME SAYING TO ME REPEATEDLY THAT THEY JUST WANT TO ENJOY THE TOURNAMENT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY TROUBLE HERE AND THE POLICE NICK THEY REALLY WORK
JUST WATCHING THEM THEY HAD ENORMOUS SHIELDS WITH TO PUSH CROWDS ARE PARTS AND AS I SAID AS AS THE NIGHT FELL THEY SPRAYED TEAR GAS BUT THE FANS DID RETALIATE BY THROWING
CUPS AND BOTTLES BACK AT THEM AS WELL IS LIGHTING FLARES AND BANGERS AND BRIEF HASIM IVANOV ARRIVING IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS FOR THE GAME THIS AFTERNOON
ABSOLUTELY AS YOU SAID WALES AND ENGLAND AND THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THAT GAME COULD LEAD TO FURTHER VIOLENCE AT THIS SUMMER'S ENGLAND FANS TOLD HIS YESTERDAY THEY'RE HERE TO FIGHT BUT IT'S WORTH SAYING THAT MANY OF THEM SAID BUT THEY'RE NOT AS I SAID THEY JUST WANT TO ENJOY THE TOURNAMENT AND LEAVING
WE CAN TOUCH HER IN LIL THANK YOU WE'LL HEAR MORE FROM SEMEN LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN THE INQUEST INTO THE SUICIDE OF EDWARD MALLON REVEALED MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THE DEPRESSED EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS CARE NOW THE CORONER IS RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT G.P.S PRESCRIBING MEDICAL MEDICATION TO MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS WITHOUT TAKING ADVICE FROM CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST HUGH PYM AS A HEALTH EDITOR AND HUGH THIS IS BECAUSE EDWARD MALLON WAS PRESCRIBED STRONG ANTI DEPRESSANTS BUT NOT WARNED ABOUT THEIR SIDE EFFECTS
YES THAT'S RIGHT SIR AT THIS WAS A VERY TRAGIC CASE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD EDWARD MULLEN A SCHOOL PUPIL A STAR PUPIL DESCRIBED AT THE INQUEST EARLY THIS WEEK IS EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND VERY TALENTED WITH LOTS OF FRIENDS WITH A PLACE AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY I WAS GRIPPED BY DEPRESSION AND TOOK HIS OWN LIFE AND HIS FATHER
STEVE MALLON HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING SINCE THEN TO RAISE AWARENESS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HE FEELS ABLE WAS LET DOWN BY THE SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP WAS OVER MEDICATION WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED
AN ANTI DEPRESSANT CITALOPRAM WHICH HE WAS BY THE G.P. THE G.P. HAD SAID HE'D TALKED TO A MENTAL HEALTH WORKER AT THE TRUST A LOCAL TRUSTS CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM
AND BEEN RECOMMENDED THAT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE DRUG EVEN THOUGH IT HAD POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS WITH PATIENTS FEELING WORSE BEFORE THEY GET BETTER HE THEN WENT AHEAD AND PRESCRIBED DIDN'T IF YOU LIKE EXPLAIN ALL THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS TO EDWARD MULLEN THE CORONER WAS BEMUSED BY THIS AND WAS CONTINUALLY QUESTIONING WHY HER G.P. TAKEN ADVICE FROM A WORKER AT A LOCAL TRUST MENTAL HEALTH TRUST ON THE PHONE
G.P. SAID THAT'S WAS THE NORMAL PRACTICE BUT THE PERSON FROM THE TRUST GAVE EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY SAYING NO IT'S UP TO THE G.P. TO PRESCRIBE SO THE CORONER IS WRITING TO ALL LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES AUTHORITY SAYING THIS MUST BE CLEARED UP THAT IT'S MUST BE MADE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT THAT THE LINE OF COMMUNICATION IS OVER HOW ANTI DEPRESSION'S LIKE THIS ARE ADMINISTERED BUT WHAT BECAME CLEAR IN THE INQUEST WAS WHEN LOOKING AT THIS YOUNG MAN'S RAPID DESCENT TO SUCH A POOR STATE WAS THERE WERE MANY PROBLEMS WITH HIS
YES THE G.P. FELT THAT AN URGENT REFERRAL WAS NEEDED AFTER WE FIRST SAW EDWARD EXPRESSING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKER AT THE TRUST OF A PHONE LINE YOU SPOKE TO EDWARD FELT IT COULD BE DOWNGRADED TO FIVE DAYS SO THERE WAS A DELAY EDWARD THEN SAW OTHER STAFF AT THE LOCAL TRUST CAMBRIDGE AND PETERBOROUGH AND
THEN WAS THERE WAS CONFUSION OVER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT AND IT WAS SAID TO BE A POSSIBILITY THAT EDWARD WAS LOSING FAITH IN THE SYSTEM AND ALSO THE FACT THAT HE'D EXPRESS THESE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS TO STAFF AT THE TRUST BUT EVEN THOUGH HE'D GIVEN HIS CONSENT
THOSE MENTAL HEALTH TRUST STAFF HADN'T CONSULTED HIS PARENTS EDWARD'S PARENTS HADN'T DISCUSSED IT WITH THEM SO THE PARENTS NEVER KNEW THAT EDWARD
HAD TO THESE THOUGHTS SO A WHOLE SERIES OF ISSUES ABOUT THE CARE AND ACTUALLY THE ASSISTANT PAUL OF THE CAMBRIDGESHIRE BELINDA CHENEY WHO CONDUCTED THE INQUEST SAID THAT SHE AGREED HE'D SLIPPED THROUGH CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM THAT THERE'D BEEN A LACK OF CONTINUITY OF CARE NO ONE HAD TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT THE TRUST DID ACCEPT A LOT OF THESE CRITICISMS ALTHOUGH IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IMPROVEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE SUBSEQUENTLY TO THAT PROCEDURES HUGH PYM THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL BE SPEAKING TO EDWARD'S FATHER IN JUST OVER AN HOUR'S TIME

IT'S FOR JOURNALISTIC SKILL LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE EARN SO MUCH MONEY IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING FOR SENIOR CONSERVATIVES INCLUDING TWO FORMER CHANCELLORS HAVE ACCUSED THE BANK OF ENGLAND IN THE TREASURY ARE PEDDLING PHONEY FORECASTS TO SCARE PEOPLE INTO VOTING TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
M.P.S AND PEERS HAVE NOW STARTED A SHORT BREAK UNTIL AFTER THE REFERENDUM ON THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT BEFORE EVERYONE HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IT WAS TIME YESTERDAY FOR ONE MORE SESSION OF PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN REPORTS THE NEXT TIME M.P.S GATHER IN THE COMMONS CHAMBER THEY AND WE WILL KNOW THE RESULTS OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHO ARE JUST EIGHT DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE REFEREE
THOSE CHEERS CAME AS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN ASKED HIS FINAL QUESTION AND MADE HIS FIRST EXPLICIT REFERENCE IN THESE EXCHANGES TO NEXT WEEK'S BIG VOTE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER CONSERVATIVES WERE SPORTING LARGE BADGES INDICATING THEIR SUPPORT FOR EITHER LEAVE OR REMAIN
JUST A FEW HOURS EARLIER THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WHO WASN'T IN THE COMMONS HAD ISSUED A WARNING THAT HE'D HAVE TO INTRODUCE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET FULL OF TAX HIKES AND SPENDING CUTS IF VOTERS OPTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION MISTER CORBETT WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE CHANCELLOR WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RELY ON LABOUR VOTES TO GET HIS PLANS THROUGH PARLIAMENT
WE WANT OUR POSE ANY POST BRECK'S IT AUSTERITY BUDGET
ANY AUSTERITY BUDGET PUT FORWARD BY THIS GOVERNMENT
AND IT WASN'T JUST LABOUR M.P.S WHO ARE THREATENING TO VOTE AGAINST THE PLANS DOZENS OF CONSERVATIVES HAD THREATENED TO REBEL AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH JEREMY CORBIN DIDN'T SEEM CONVINCED BY HIS NEW ALLIES THE PRIME MINISTER TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONDEMN THE OPPORTUNIST
FIFTY SEVEN OF HIS COLLEAGUES WHO ARE PRONE TO LEAVE WHO ARE SUDDENLY THESE ARE MEMBERS WHO BACK TO THE BEDROOM TAX
CUTTING DISABILITY BENEFITS AND SLASHING CAREFULLY ELDERLY WHO SUDDENLY I'VE NOW HAD A DAMASK IN CONVERSION TO THE ANTI AUSTERITY MOVE
THIS WAS AS CLOSE TO A CONSENSUS AS THE PRIME MINISTER WAS GOING TO GET AND HE SEIZED HIS OPPORTUNITY THERE ARE VERY FEW TIMES WHEN HE AND I ARE ON THE SAME SIDE AND ARGUE
THIS MUST SAY TO PEOPLE WATCHING BACK AT HOME THAT WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY AND INDEED ALMOST ALL OF THE LABOUR PARTY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THE GREENS THE OFFICIAL ULSTER EUNICE AND THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY
WE HAVE HUGE DISAGREEMENTS BUT ON THIS VITAL ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY THE BEST OPTION FOR BRITAIN IS TO VOTE TO REMAIN AND REFORM EUROPEAN UNION THAT REALLY CENSOR
THE PRIME MINISTER INSISTED NOBODY WANTED TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY BUDGET BUT PLENTY OF PEOPLE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT INCLUDING THE CONSERVATIVE CHRISTOPHER CHIRP LOOKING FORWARD TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE AGAINST THE VINDICTIVE EMERGENCY BUDGET
THE LEADER OF THE S.N.P. AT WESTMINSTER ANGUS ROBERTSON SOUNDED LESS ENTHUSIASTIC TODAY WE HAVE LEARNT FROM A CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER AND THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
THAT THERE WOULD BE LIKELY TO BE THIRTY BILLION POUNDS IN CUTS TO PUBLIC SERVICES OR TAX RISES WERE THERE TO BE A BRECHT SET VOTE WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON PUBLIC SERVICES IN SCOTLAND
DAVID CAMERON SAID THE FIGURES THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED BY GEORGE OSBORNE AND ALISTAIR DARLING WERE BASED ON WHAT THE INSTITUTE OF FISCAL STUDIES AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH WERE SAYING AND TO ANYONE WHO SAYS THESE WARNINGS OF COURSE THEY COULD BE WRONG OR THEY COULD BE INACCURATE THIS IS UNCOVERING POINT PERHAPS TO MAKE TO THE RIGHT ALL GENTLEMEN OF COURSE THERE WERE WARNINGS ABOUT THE OIL PRICE BEFORE THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM IT TURNED OUT ACTUALLY TO BE WORSE THAN THE EXPERTS
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER TIM FARRANT SAID IF THE U.K. VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION INTEREST RATES WOULD GO UP AND THE POUND WOULD FALL THEY WON'T PUTS PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR HOME THREE REPOSSESSION AND PUSH LOW INCOME PEOPLE
INTO CRIPPLING DEBT WHAT HE ADVISES TORY RAGS IT COLLEAGUE
THEY LONG TERM ECONOMIC PLAN ON
IN WHICH HE CAN HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HARD WORKING FAMILIES NOT TO SUFFER IT IS TO VOTE REMAIN ON THURSDAY OH CONSERVATIVE JACK HAD FOUND IT EASIER TO AGREE WITH THE PRIME MINISTER LAST NOVEMBER WHEN MISTER CAMERON HAD TOLD THE EMPLOYERS' ORGANISATION THE C.B.I. THAT THE U.K. COULD SURVIVE OUTSIDE THE E. U. F. HAS I HOPE DESPITE THE PANIC DRIVEN NEGATIVITY
ON THE REMAIN CAMP IN DOWNING STREET THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTE NEXT WEEK TO BECOME A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION
WILL MY RIGHT OF FRIEND JOIN ME EMBRACING THE GREAT OPTIMISM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR COUNTRY
I THOUGHT A MOMENTOUS DECISION
MISTER CAMERON SAID NO ONE WAS QUESTIONING THAT BRITAIN COULD SURVIVE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT HE ARGUED THAT THE COUNTRY WOULD BE STRONGER SAFER AND BETTER OFF IF PEOPLE VOTED TO STAY IN THE
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING THERE THERE'LL BE MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT HARPIST EIGHT ON LONG WAVE OR ON DIGITAL PARNELL'S ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN
DECRIMINALISE DRUGS SUPPORT THE USER'S PROSECUTE THE DEALERS THAT IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT'S CALLED A SEA CHANGE IN APPROACH IN A NEW REPORT FROM TWO BODIES THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE FACULTY OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY'S CHAIR DOCTOR FIONA SIM IS WITH ME NOW CAN WE BEGIN WITH WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE DRUG POLICY DOCTOR SAME DRUG USE AFTER ALL HE'S FALLEN IN THE LAST DECADE
YOU'RE RIGHT OVERALL DRUG USE HAS FALLEN BUT USE OF HARD DRUGS HAS NOT FALLEN AS INCREASING AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO DRUGS HAS NOT FALLEN EITHER SO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT ALTHOUGH
WE HAVE A STRATEGY AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS TRAGIC TRYING TO CONTROL DRUG USE AND TRYING TO CONTROL THEIR HOMES IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BEING ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL WE THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND YOU WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM BEING AS IT WERE A CRIMINAL POLICY RUN BY THE HOME OFFICE AND BECOME A HEALTH POLICY
RUN BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING IS SUGGESTING TO THE PUBLIC AND POLITICIANS THAT WE USE THAT WE LOOK AT THE USE OF DRUGS AS NOT BEING THAT DISSIMILAR FROM THE USE OF OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT AFFECT THE WAY THAT WE BEHAVE AS SUCH AS TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL
WHICH ART AND THE STRATEGIES WHO WERE FOR SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO BECOME DEPENDENT ON THOSE SUBSTANCES VERY MUCH SIT WITHIN HEALTH SO IF I WERE FOUND TO BE POSITION NOT JUST OF SAY CANNABIS BUT KANE OR HEROIN OR THE HARDEST OF MORE DRUGS THE POLICE WOULD DO WHAT NOTHING
WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND AS YOU SUGGEST IN POSSESSION OF AN AMOUNT FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL USE THAT WOULD BE
AND IN OUR SCHEME OF THINGS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING DECRIMINALISED SO THE PERSON WOULDN'T BE PROSECUTED THEY'D BE SIGNPOSTED DIRECTED SUPPORTED TWO OR HEALTH RELATED INTERVENTION
TO SUPPORT THEM TO TO TO LIVE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE WHAT PEOPLE FEAR IS THAT THAT WOULD NORMALISE DRUG USE IT WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HEROIN USE IS AS NOBLE AS HAVING A GLASS OF BEER OR A GLASS OF WINE WITH A MEAL AND THEY WOULD ARGUE ON HEALTH GROUNDS LET ALONE CRIMINAL GROUNDS IT SIMPLY ISN'T
RYAN AT THE MOMENT THE EVIDENCE WORLDWIDE WHERE THIS KIND OF DECRIMINALISATION APPROACH AND A HEALTH PROMOTING APPROACHES IS IS HAPPENING THAT ACTUALLY ISN'T TRUE
AS YOU SAY THOSE POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE IN PORTUGAL OF WORMS AND THAT'S IT LOOKS AS THOUGH BY AND LARGE POLICIES THAT ARE DECRIMINALISING THE USE OF DRUGS ARE WORKING REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF DRUG WHAT WE'RE SAYING VERY CLEARLY THERE IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DECRIMINALISE DEALING
PUSHING DRUGS IMPORTING OF DRUGS AND WE'RE NOT THEREFORE PROMOTING ANYWAY THE USE OF DRUGS ONE LAST QUESTION BRIEFLY IF YOU WILL SOME PEOPLE WORRY IN PARTICULAR IN PORTUGAL BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THE TAX MAN ENDS UP FUNDING THE LIFESTYLE OF ATTICS THAT ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU STOP IT BAKEWELL CRUEL PROBABLY MAKE IT HEALTH PROBLEM THEN WE ARE ALL FORCED TO SAY WHAT WHAT LOOK WILL SUPPORT YOU LIFELONG IN TAKING HEROIN OR CRACK OR WHATEVER IT IS
THE INTENTION IS THAT WE HELP PEOPLE TO STOP THEY USE SO THAT WE WERE THEY WOULDN'T BE LIFELONG DEPENDS ON THE STAGE AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT MINT MEDIUM TO LONG TERM IS FOR THE COST TO THE STATE WOULD BE MUCH LESS DUE TO THE REDUCTION COSTS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND BRING PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL AND INTO INTO HEALTH
TO BE HONEST HIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SO THE TIME'S NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE R.M.T. UNION SAYS SOMEONE TRAINS ARE TRYING TO BLAME STAFF ARE CANCELLED OR DELAYED TRAINS BUT IT SAYS THE PROBLEMS ARE DOWN TO THE COMPANY ITSELF KEITH MITCHELL AS A CONDUCTOR BASED AT EASTBOURNE DEPOT OF SUDDEN DRAINS IS ALSO A LOCAL BRANCH SECRETARY FOR THE R.M.T.
THE DAILY DISRUPTION IS DOWN TO THE COMPANY
THEY'RE CANCELLING TRAINS SOME TRAINS THEY DON'T NEED TO CANCEL BECAUSE THEY WERE GODS AND DRIVERS TO DO THAT
DO YOU THINK THIS IS LIKELY TO CARRY ON
UNTIL THE G.T. ALL THE COMPANY SIT ROUND THE TABLE WITH A N. TEA AND HAVE PROPER MEANING
I DON'T
THEN NO THE COMPANY WALKING NOW
BANGING THE TABLE AND SHOUT IN THAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING SEND IN MY MEMBERS THREATENING
THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR BENEFITS THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK
WHATEVER THEY TELL THEM TO DO REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE RULES
DOES NOT HELP WE'RE JOINED BY TONY MILES FROM MODERN RAILWAYS MAGAZINE WHO IS IN SALFORD GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THE COMMUTERS HERE COS WE WERE HEARING YESTERDAY THINGS ARE VERY BAD AT SOUTHERN RAILWAYS AREN'T THEY THEY ARE
VERY BAD AT THE MOMENT YES IT'S PART OF A VERY LONG TERM DISPUTE BETWEEN THE CONDUCTORS GO VIA THAMES LINK RAILWAY WHO OPERATE SOUTHERNERS AS PART OF THAT FRANCHISE AND TO DO IT CHANGES THE COMPANY WANTS TO PUT THROUGH TO THE ROLE OF THE GUARD
RIGHT AND THE WE HEARD YESTERDAY THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. CHRIS PHILP SAY THAT THE FRANCHISE SHOULD BE BROKEN UP BUT THE COMPANY SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING LOOK AT THAT THEY CAN'T CONTROL IT IF THE STAFF AREN'T WORKING THEY'RE GOING ON STRIKE NEXT TUESDAY TWENTY FOUR HOUR STRIKE
THEY SHOULDN'T BE HELD TO BLAME FOR THAT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT WHAT ARE YE YE GO VIA TIM THINK RAILWAY FRANCHISES IS A SPECIFIC AGREEMENT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO THE WAY OTHER FRANCHISES WORK IN THE U.K. IN THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY A MANAGEMENT CONTRACT WHERE THE COMPANY'S PAID A FEE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO RUN THE RAILWAY IN THE GOVERNMENT CARRIES THE REVENUE RISK AT THE MOMENT PARTLY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH WORK GOING ON THAT ALL THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WITH LONDON BRIDGE BEING PARTLY CLOSED
SO IT'S MANAGING THE RAILWAY DIFFERENTLY AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT WITHIN ITS AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW CHANGES TO THE ROLES OF STUFF THAT THAT IT'S REQUIRED TO DELIVER SO IT'S A COMPLICATED ONE BECAUSE IT THE COMPANY'S DOING WHAT IT WAS TOLD TO DO WHEN IT'S SIGNED IT'S AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND TO BE FAIR TO THEM WHOEVER HAD SIGNED THE CONTRACT OF ALL THE COMPANIES THAT WANTED TO RUN IT THEY WOULD ALL BE DOING EXACTLY THE SAME AT THE MOMENT RIGHT BECAUSE CLAIRE PERRY THE TRANSPORT SECRETARY MINISTER HAS SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT
THE BOSSES ARE TOP OF THE RANGE SUPER EXPERIENCE I THINK WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY SHE'S RIGHT WHEN SHE SAYS THAT THEY ARE SOME VERY EXPERIENCED OPERATORS THUNDERY SOME SURPRISE I THINK EVEN WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING ALMOST AS IF THEY ARE UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY ARE SORRY WHO'S BEEN USING THAT EVEN THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT IT IT IS QUITE STARK THE LANGUAGE THEY'VE BEEN USING ABOUT HAVING TO DELIVER THESE CHANGES
I THINK THE FIGHTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE UNIONS I THINK BEHIND THE SCENES IT CERTAINLY IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SEE THE ROLLING OUT OF DIFFERENT ROLES FOR GODS PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY IF ANY OTHER FRANCHISES WERE TO TRY AND DO THIS AND FAY STRIKES THEY WOULD LOSE THE INCOME AND IT WOULD AFFECT THEIR BALANCES BUT
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT CARRIES THE RISK ON OUR LOSS OF REVENUE ON IT ISN'T IMPACTING SO MUCH THAT THIS WAS PUT UP ENOUGH IN PRIVATE EYE LAST WEEK THEY MADE THE POINT THAT THE GOVERNMENT CARRIES THE RISK SO THIS IS THE BEST COMPANY FOR THEM TO TRY AND PUSH THROUGH THE CHANGES AND IN THE MEANTIME IT'S THE COMMUTERS THOSE USING THE SERVICES WHO ARE PAYING THE PRICE FOR THIS UNFORTUNATELY YES I NOTICE THAT THERE'S BEEN A BIG PROTEST AT BRIGHTON SAYING THAT THE COMPANY SHOULD BE STRIPPED OF ITS FRANCHISE
THE COMPANY ACTUALLY IS IN DEFAULT OF ITS FRANCHISE NOW BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF CANCELLATIONS IT SHOULD BE BEING STRIPPED OF ITS FRANCHISE BUT IT WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT WAS BECAUSE IF THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IT BACK INTO STATE CONTROL TEMPORARILY AS IT DID WITH EAST COAST A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO SEE THESE CHANGES EVEN THE GOVERNMENT BODY WOULD STILL BE PUSHING THROUGH THE CHANGES TO THE ROLES OF STUFF THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED NOW AND JUST PEOPLE ARE YOU SYMPATHETIC TO THE REASONS FOR THE CHANGES
THAT'S VERY CONFUSING ONE AND IT HANGS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE TERMS ARE FOR THAT THEIR NEW ROLES PARTICULAR VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF CASES ONE IN COURT AT THE MOMENT SO WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT THAT EFFECT INCIDENTS IN LIVERPOOL WHERE ONE GUY WENT TO PRISON AND ANOTHER GUARD IS FACING COURT FACING A TRIAL IN A FEW WEEKS' TIME
AND CERTAINLY THAT'S HAVING AN IMPACT AND I THINK UNTIL THAT CASE HAS BEEN HEARD NOBODY'S REALLY GOING TO WANT TO DISCUSS IT BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY TONY MILES THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN AND ALEX DEACONS HERE WITH THE WEATHER THANKS VERY MUCH NICK GOOD MORNING DRY PROSPECTS AHEAD FOR THE WEEKEND BUT MOST OF THE U.K. WILL SEE SOME RAIN AGAIN THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY TODAY LET'S SPLIT IT UP INTO TWO AREAS FOR TODAY I'LL START WITH ALL OF ENGLAND AND WALES MISTY MURKY START BEFORE PRACTICE STILL FOR PARTS OF LINCOLNSHIRE AND EAST MIDLANDS STEADILY CLEAR AWAY THE DAY

WITH THE GOVERNMENT PREPARING A NEW DRUG STRATEGY THIS IS A BOLD AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE THE REPORT SAYS CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FAILED TO DETER ILLEGAL DRUG USE UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES AND MAY ACT AS A BARRIER TO ADDICTS COMING FORWARD FOR HELP IT CALLS FOR A SEA CHANGE IN APPROACH AND SAYS THE U.K. SHOULD ADOPT THE PORTUGUESE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH PEOPLE CAUGHT USING DRUGS OFF A TREATMENT AND SUPPORT RATHER THAN BEING PUNISHED THOUGH DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS WOULD STILL BE PROSECUTED
THE STUDY ALSO SUGGEST THAT DRUGS EDUCATION BE MADE MANDATORY AND THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR DRUGS POLICY BE MOVED FROM THE HOME OFFICE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THE HOME OFFICE HAS DEFENDED ITS RECORD SAYING DRUG MISUSE HAS DECLINED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

CORRIE CORFIELD IT'S NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN FRENCH POLICE USED TEAR GAS TO DISPERSE ENGLAND FANS IN LILLE LAST NIGHT THERE WERE THIRTY SIX ARRESTS AMONG THEM DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES BUT IT IS THE FOURTH TIME THAT ENGLAND FANS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE SINCE THE START OF EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP SHIPS JUST UNDER A WEEK AGO A SPORTS EDITOR DAN ROAN SPENT THE DAY WITH THE ENGLAND TEAM YESTERDAY AND DOWN WITH THEIR NERVES THERE ABOUT HOW ENGLAND FANS WOULD BEHAVE
I THINK THIS CLEARLY CONCERN AND I THINK THAT WILL HAVE TO HAVE INTENSIFIED OVERNIGHT BECAUSE CLEARLY ENGLAND ARE NOW A SKATING ON THIN ICE TO SOME EXTENT GIVEN THESE SCENES WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN WATCHING IN LILLE ALREADY LAST WEEK ENGLAND APPEALED TO THEIR FANS ROY HODGSON THE MANAGER AND WAYNE ROONEY THE CAPTAIN BOTH
URGING THE SUPPORTERS TO BEHAVE THEMSELVES AND NOT LET THEM DOWN AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WAY FURTHER COMPETITION ORGANISERS HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
THAT ENGLAND AND ESPECIALLY RUSSIA COULD BE THROWN OUT OF THIS COMPETITION OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR FANS DOESN'T IMPROVE ADAM'LL ALONG ANOTHER ENGLAND PLAYER SIR BUT HE WOULD BE DEVASTATED IN HIS WORDS IF THIS COST THEM A PLACE IN THE COMPETITION SO I THINK IT MUST AFFECT THEM I MEAN THIS IS A HUGE GAME THEY HAVE TODAY AGAINST WALES IN LON SUMMER SPEAKING TO
MEMBERS OF THE F.A. WERE INVOLVED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND DURING THE YEAR WAS SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN ENGLAND CAME CLOSE TO BEING KICKED OUT OF THAT COMPETITION BECAUSE OF TROUBLE IN CHARLES WHY
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ENGLAND TEAM WAS WAS CERTAINLY AFFECTED BY THAT THE FACT THAT THEY KNEW THAT IT WASN'T HIS RESULTS ON THE PITCH THERE MIGHT AFFECT THEIR FATE IT WAS IT WAS THE BEHAVIOUR OF THEIR FANS AS WELL AND HERE WE ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION SO THEY WILL TRY TO BLOCK IT OUT BUT INEVITABLY I THINK IT MUST HAVE AN EFFECT ON
IT'S THE LAST THING THEY NEED BECAUSE THIS IS IS A HIGH PRESSURE GAME AGAINST WALES NOW ENGLAND FAILED TO WIN THEIR FIRST MATCH AGAINST RUSSIA HE MUST SAY WALES WON THEIR FIRST MATCH AGAINST SLOVAKIA SO THE PRESSURE IS ALL ON ROY HODGSON SIDE AND IF THEY
IF THEY LOSE TODAY THAN THEY REALLY ARE IN TROUBLE IN TERMS OF QUALIFICATION FROM ITS GROUP BUT IN TERMS OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF TROUBLE AT THE MATCH THE FACT THAT IT'S WALES IS PROBABLY QUITE GOOD NEWS
WHILE THIS MATCH WAS ALWAYS SEEN AS AS A DIFFICULT ONE FOR THE AUTHORITIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT RUSSIA
WERE PLAYING JUST UP THE ROAD IN LEGAL YESTERDAY AGAINST SLOVAKIA AND HERE WE ARE TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER WITH ENGLAND AND WALES PLAYING TWENTY MILES DOWN THE ROAD IN LAWNS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BRITISH FANS ARE IN LYON BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY THERE BECAUSE LONG'S IS SUCH A SMALL TOWN TO BE HOSTING A GAME OF THAT MAGNITUDE SO SOME QUESTIONS I THINK FOR THE ORGANISERS UEFA IN TERMS OF THEIR SCHEDULING OF THESE GAMES BUT YES THE FACT THE RUSSIA HAVE PLAYED AND THEORETICALLY THERE VAN SHOULD NOW BE DISPERSING AND MOVING ON THEIR NEXT MATCH THEIR THIRD GAME IN THE GROUP IS AGAINST WALES IN TOULOUSE
SHOULD MEAN THAT THINGS PASS OFF MORE PEACEFULLY HOWEVER WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT LAST NIGHT WHILE THIS WASN'T MA WHERE WE SAW RUNNING BATTLES BETWEEN ENGLAND A RUSSIAN FANS WITH WITH THE RUSSIANS LARGELY BE AGGRESSORS AND SOMETIMES VICIOUS FIGHTING INVOLVING THOSE TWO SETS OF SUPPORTERS THIS THIS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN MOSTLY CASH CLASHES BETWEEN ENGLAND FANS AND THE FRENCH POLICE NOW THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS FROM ENGLAND FANS THE POLICE OVER REACTED WITH TEAR GAS AND NOT SURE WHY POLICE CHARGE THEM
IN SOME INSTANCES CLEARLY AUTHORITIES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF A REPEAT OF MARSEILLE BUT HAVING SAID THAT THERE WAS VIOLENCE THERE WAS CHAOS ON THE STREETS THIRTY SIX ARRESTS SIXTEEN PEOPLE HOSPITALISED THERE WERE SKIRMISHES MOSTLY WE UNDERSTAND INVOLVING ENGLAND FANS ALTHOUGH THERE WERE WE BELIEVE RUSSIAN ULTRAS AS WELL ON THE STREETS OF LAYOUT
LAST NIGHT THERE WORD SEAN CHANCE TAUNTING RUSSIA FRANCE BOTTLES WERE THROWN AND ALL THIS MEANS THAT ENGLAND ARE NEAR THAT LINE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY UEFA HAVE SAID ANY MORE TROUBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO INSIDE STAV
AND ENGLAND RUN THE RISK OF BEING THROWN OUT OF THE COMPETITION NOW THIS OF COURSE WAS OUTSIDE THE STADIUM DOWN BLOOD WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON THERE IS SOME WRIGGLE ROOM YOU WAIT FOR DAMN I DON'T THINK PROBABLY IT'S ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO GET THEM KICKED ALBERT CERTAINLY BETTER THEY'RE ON THIN ICE NOW THE F.A. DAN ROUND THANKS VERY MUCH TWELVE TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN A GRATUITOUS ACT OF SELF HARM THAT IS THE PITHY DESCRIPTION OF WHAT A VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WOULD AMOUNT TO FOR BRITAIN ACCORDING TO TODAY'S FINANCIAL TIMES EDITORIAL
THE PAPER HAS DECLARED ITSELF NOT SURPRISINGLY ON THE SIDE OF A VOTE TO REMAIN JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THE SUN NOT VERY SURPRISINGLY DECLARED FOR LEAVE THE EMPTIES EDITOR LIONEL BARBER IS WITH US NOW WHY A GRATUITOUS ACT OF SELF HARM
WELCOME MORNING NICK NO WE DO KNOW THREE THINGS THAT THERE WILL BE A POLITICAL CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY IF WE VOTE NOW I DON'T SEE ANY WAY BACK DAVID CAMERON SURVIVING WE WON'T KNOW WHO'S WHO WILL TAKE OVER WE WON'T KNOW THAN THE TERMS
ON WHICH A NEW GOVERNMENT WHAT GOVERNMENT WERE WANT FOUR NEW MEMBERS FOR THE DRAWING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A SHOCK TO THE ECONOMY
NOW I THINK MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL WE WE WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY WE'VE ACTUALLY GROWN BETTER MORE THAN MORE IMPRESSIVELY IN THE REST OF YEAR BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE SEVERITY OF THE SHOCK AND THEN THERE ARE THE WIDER POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS A CHOICE BETWEEN COMPETING VALUES AT A DANGEROUS TIME BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHO FAVOURS US LEAVING MARINE LE PEN
DONALD TRUMP VLADIMIR PUTIN MAY NOT HAVE SAID IT PUBLICLY BUT CERTAINLY THE KREMLIN WOULD BE INTERESTED AND HE'S INTERESTED IN A WEEK OR LESS COHERENT WESTERN EUROPE
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF OUR ALLIES FROM AUSTRALIA THROUGH TO THE UNITED STATES VIA JAPAN AND EVEN THOSE WHO LOOK ON US IN THE CONTINENT AS PERFIDIOUS ALBION THEY'RE IN FAVOUR OF THE STAYING AS WELL AND YET AND YET IT MUST MAKE YOU PAUSE TO REALISE THAT THE COUNTRY MAY WELL VOTE FOR BRICKS AT THE POLLS ARE VERY CLOSE AND WE SHOW THAT LEVER'S HEAD NOW EVEN IN YOUR OWN EDITORIAL
YOU CONDEMNED THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN FOR WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS POCKET BOOK SCAREMONGERING ISN'T THE PROBLEM HERE THAT THERE HAS BEEN WILFUL EXAGGERATION OF THINGS THAT ARE ONLY FOR KARLSEN THEREFORE CAN'T BE CERTAIN AT ALL TO TRY AND FRIGHTEN VOTERS INTO DOING SOMETHING THEY DON'T MUCH WANT TO DO
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESULT WILL BE BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT AND THIS IS ANECDOTAL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ARE FED UP WITH BEING LECTURED AND THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO BEING PERHAPS TOO PRECISE BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE LITTLE NUMBER BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE COSTS OF US HAVE TO BE E.U. BUDGET OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IF WE LEAVE
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AND INTEREST RATE RISES AND THAT THE EIGHT BILLION NET COST OF US BEING IN THE E.U. VERSES THE FORTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF DEBT FINANCING COS YOU'VE GOT TO GET A SENSE OF PROPORTION HIM BUT IT ISN'T THE PROBLEM NOT SIMPLY THE PRECISION OF THE FIGURES ALL THE FORK ASS FRANKLY THEY LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID AT THE F.T. WE LOOK AT THE EDITOR OF THE F.T. AND THEY SAY IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU
THIS CLUB WORKS FOR YOU IT WORKS FOR YOUR READERS YOU'RE WEALTHY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL GLOBALISATION HAS BEEN A GOOD THING THAT'S IF THEY'RE BEING UNGENEROUS IF THEY'RE BEING GENEROUS THEY'RE MUCH YOU SAY YOU'VE GOT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE ROBIN THE PAST WHY ON EARTH SHOULD WE LISTEN WELL NECK I MEAN I DO PLEAD GUILTY TO HAVING WORKED FOR SIX YEARS AND IN BRUSSELS AS THE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES I'D CAN PLEAD GUILTY ALSO TO BEING SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT IN LOOKING AT HOW THIS
POLICE WORKS BUT IS THE EXPERTS HAVE GOT US INTO THE MESS THAT'S WHAT I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE MOST DISPIRITING THINGS WHICH WAS SAID IN THIS CAMPAIGN MY MICHAEL GO I THINK HAS A FINE MIND WAS WHEN HE SAID THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF OF THE EXPERT DEPRESSING WHY BECAUSE PLENTY PEOPLE MIGHT LISTENING TO THIS PROGRAMME MIGHT SAY WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH YOU DIDN'T SEE THE CRASH COMING YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT WHAT THE BANKERS WERE UP TO YOU LOT GOT US INTO WHERE WE ARE OVER THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT
PRECISELY A CRASH AND BY THE WAY MANY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED EXPERTS HE DID PREDICT THE FINANCIAL CRASH BUT WHEN IT'S WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXAGGERATION IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER SIDE OF SAID TURKEY JOINING BY TWENTY TWENTY AS I WROTE MOST THERE'S A BETTER CHANCE OF ISTANBUL BEEN RENAMED CAN STANTON OPAL THAN TURKEY JOINING BY TWENTY TWENTY WILL EVERY BACK IF IT IS LIONEL BARBER OF THE F.T. THERE ARE OTHER VIEWS OF COURSE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN A BIG INVESTOR IN EUROPEAN INDUSTRY HAS COME OUT FIRMLY IN FAVOUR OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS MORE ON THAT THANKS ERUV HAD THE FINANCIAL TIMES AS VERDICT BUT NOW A NEW VOICE IN THE IN THE BUSINESS DEBATE ON BRICKS AND EMITS GARRY CLEAR SHH OF CRECHE INCO NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME BUT A WELL KNOWN NAME IN THE CITY HE'S A VETERAN AMERICAN FINANCIER NOW BASED IN LONDON AND SWITZERLAND WHO HAS SPENT THIRTY YEARS BUYING OIL AND GAS PLANT STEEL MILLS ON THE BITS OF THE UNFASHIONABLE OLD ECONOMY
HE WAS ON SIX UNSUCCESSFUL BITTER EXCUSE ME FOR THE TATA STEEL PLANT AND SCUNTHORPE HE WANTS BRITAIN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION I ASK THEM EXACTLY WHAT WAS HOLDING THE U.K. BACK
BY AND LARGE THE THE ACADEMY HER ACADEMIES OF EUROPE OR A SORT OF DIRECTED FROM BRUSSELS AND BRUSSELS THE SORT OF THE MARBLE IS A VERY STATIC MODEL VERY HEAVILY REGULATED MODEL A LOT OF REGULATIONS A LOT OF RULES LARDER COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND IN THEY'RE STATIC ENVIRONMENT IT'S HARD TO CHANGE DIRECTION
IT'S HARD TO MAKE AMENDMENTS IT'S HARD TO REVERSE YOURSELF IF A BUSINESS IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF WHAT WE DO IS TURN AROUND BUSINESSES IN BRITAIN IS IT'S PART OF IT RIGHT NOW IS THE FUTURE OF BRECK'S IT ALLOWS BRITAIN TO GET AWAY FROM THAT STATIC ONEROUS MUDDLE AND THEY CAN GO TO WHAT I WOULD CALL AS A DYNAMIC MARKING ONLINE
THAT'S FOCUSED AND GROWTH ON MARBLE THAT RELIEVES BUSINESS OF REGULATION AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IN BRITAIN IS A MEMBER OR BUSINESSES THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES YOU KNOW THEY THEY JUST FEEL THEY'RE OVERTAKEN BY THIS THIS HEADED HE CALLED BRUSSELS WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THIS LIBERATED BRITAIN OUTSIDE OF EUROPE WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INWARD INVESTORS LIKE YOU
I THINK NOT ONLY ME BUT ANY INVESTOR LOOKING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT ASIA GROWTH EVERYWHERE TALKS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATES AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOU SORT OF GET INVESTORS TALKING ABOUT EUROPE IN THAT CONTEXT IT REAL ADVANTAGE TO BRITAIN
IS ONCE YOU MOVE INTO A DYNAMIC MARKET IT'LL LAST FOR EXPLOSIVE CROAKS IT ALLOWS YOU TO INVEST IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT BURDENED WITH CUMBERSOME CUMBERSOME REGULATION COMING OUT OF BRUSSELS DO YOU HAVE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A OF A COMPANY BUT YOU'VE LOOKED AT WHICH WAS BEING HELD BACK BY THE CENTRAL US APPROACH I THINK
JUST ABOUT EVERY BUSINESS I'D BUY IT IT'S NOT ONLY EVERY BUSINESS I OWN WHICH HAS COME OUT OF THAT
AS BROWN BUSINESS HE'S IN GERMANY AREN'T BUSINESS ISN'T IT ALL THESE WERE SO I TAKE HER TO SEE IT FIRST HERE WOULD LEAVING EUROPE BE A RISK FREE STEP THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS IN LIFE THERE'S NO RISK FREE TRANSACTIONS AND YOU GET FED UP AT YOUR JOB AND YOU WANT TO SWITCH JOBS
THERE IS A RISK THERE WILL BE SHORT TERM PAIN BUT THE WAY I SHOWED A LOT OF MY FRIENDS IS A BIT SHORTER AND PAINT BUT THE RELIANT TRY AGAIN I'M OFFENDED BY THE PRESENT STAGE COMING OVER HERE TELLING ME THAT I'M GOING TO BE THE BACK OF THE QUEUE WHEN I HAVE THE CHEF LARGES ARE CURRENTLY IN THE WORLD I WONDER IF HE'S CONSULTED FORK OR FLEAS CONSULT AN APPLE WHEN HE MIXED OR STATEMENTS DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT SAME ARGUMENT APPLIES TO ALL THE HITS OF LARGE PUBLIC COMPANIES OF HEAD IN THE LAST FEW DAYS COMING OUT IN FAVOUR OF REMAIN
IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE INVESTED IN THE STATUS QUO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TRICK IN THE BIGGER THE CORPORATION THE LESS THEY LIKE TRICK THEM BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE TODAY IN THE GLOBAL CAN'T YOU SEE THE GLOBAL CALMLY COMING DOWN NOT BECAUSE A BRIC A BRAC SAID BY IT'S COMING DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S GROSS CANCEROUS BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BENCH EACH BIG MULTINATIONALS THEY DON'T LIKE UNEXPECTED TREATS YOU NO I LIKE THE UNCERTAINTY
THAT THIS TREAT WILL COST BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU MARCUS HAD DEALT WITH FAR GREATER CHANGED IN THIS AND COME THROUGH A VERY VERY VERY WELL THAT WAS GARY CLAIRE SHOULD CLINICIAN COLOURS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HE DON'T EAT TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND JUST OVER SIX HOURS TIME LARGE PARTS OF TWO NATIONS WILL GRIND TO A HALT AS FANS OF ENGLAND AND WALES SQUEEZE ONTO SOFAS PACK INTO PUBS
OR CROWD AROUND THEIR P.C.S IN HAND HOLDS FOR THE MUCH AWAITED CLASH OF THE HOME NATIONS THERE MAY EVEN BE A LITTLE SINGING BUT WHAT MAKES A GREAT NATIONAL FOOTBALL ANTHEM THE WELSH BAND MANIC STREET PEACH IT PREACHERS HAVE PRODUCED THE OFFICIAL ANTHEM FOR THE COUNTRY'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN A MAJOR FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP IN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AND I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MANICS LYRICIST MICKEY WHAT
ONE BRAND ZERO ONE MAKER
IT'S TAKEN TWENTY YEARS TO WRITE IT MAYBE EVEN I THINK THAT NINETY THREE WE LOST TO ROMANIA PAUL IN MY WE HAD A CHANCE TO QUALIFY FOR THE U.S.A. WORLD CUP PLAYED BRILLIANT THAT NIGHT BUT JUST WASN'T TO BE AS YOU LISTEN TO THE LYRICS AS YOU WATCH THE MUSIC VIDEO YEAH IT DOES FEEL LIKE THIS IS A LIFE'S WORK ANOTHER LIFE OF DESPAIR IT CONSTANTLY ALMOST GETTING THROUGH TO CHAMPIONSHIPS AND THEN BEING KNOCKED OUT WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THEM WHEN I'VE BEEN AT QUITE A FEW MYSELF
I THINK HE'S JAMES THE LYRIC IT'S ABOUT TO PITY BUT I THOUGHT HER FOOT WAS NOT TO BE A SHORT LYRIC NOW LIKE A USUAL WESTERNS AND IT DOES SORT OF GO THROUGH ALL THE TRAVAILS OF BEING A WELSH FOOTBALL FAN OVER THE YEARS GETTING SO CLOSE AND HANDSOME KNIGHTS ENTHUSE WELSH MELANCHOLIA
WELL HOW MUCH WHEN YOU COME TO WRITE ANTHEM WHICH IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE MANICS NORMALLY DO DO YOU LOOK BACK AND THINK OH I DON'T WANT IT TO SAY ABOUT THE DEAL AND SKILL OF THE FAMOUS ENGLAND THREE LIONS I QUITE FANCY IT SOUNDING LIKE NEW ORDER'S WORLD MOTION HOW DID YOU APPROACH THE ORDER'S WORLD IN MOTION IS PROBABLY THE ULTIMATE ONE
THE GENIUS OF OUR SONG IS THIS SOUNDED LIKE A NEW ORDER TRACK SO WHEN WE STARTED TO WRITE TO HIM SAID THIS SONG HAS TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO BE ON THE MANICS ALBUM TO BE HONEST SINCE SINCE THREE LINES THERE'S BEEN SOME WOEFUL STUFF BRACE CAN
AND DES TUCKER WE'VE GOT SAUSAGE FOR CHATS AND IF COS I'M A TOP WITH THAT AND THIS ECKENER BLAME ANYONE WANT MY FEAR BANDS OF ALL TIME MANAGED TO DO ONE WITH THE SPICE GIRLS ONCE FOR ENGLAND IT'S JUST NO ONE
FOR US TO DO IT WE WANT TO HAVE A GREAT LYRIC REAL BELL'S KITCHEN SINK STRINGS GUITARS AND I THINK
AND THAT NEW ORDER WHAT YOU DIDN'T RESIST WHAT THEY WERE TEMPTED BY WHICH IS A FOOTBALLER OR A PATENT AND OTHERS DANCING AND SINGING
BREAK THEN SECTION IS A CHANT SO THE RAT WOULD BE GOING TOO FAR AND WHEN WE DID THE VIDEO BECAUSE WE MENTIONED BACK FIFTEEN PLAYS ARE IN THE SQUAD IN THE TEAM THE WHOLE SQUAD WAS THERE AND I FELT REALLY BAD COS OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WILL KNOCK AND SET THAT AND THE IDEA FOR A CHANCE IN A WAY
INSPIRED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE DEALERS GET IT WAS NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST SEEN WE COULD SING ON THE TERRACES YOU CAN CHANT IT ON BITTER YEAH I MEAN THREE LINES IS IT'S A GRIP PROBABLY THE BEST LYRIC EITHER
BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY ABOUT FOOTBALL AND IT DOES IT AGAIN IT TAKES YOU THROUGH A KIND OF POT HE HISTORY
WHAT ABOUT THE FOOTBALL YOU PULL IT OFF TODAY CAN THEY WIN
COULD BE SOMETHING I MEAN IS THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED YEAH WHEN EVERYTHING GETS BUILT UP AROUND THESE MASSIVE GAMES
SOMETIMES A KISS IT'S ALMOST TOO PAINFUL TO POTS WHEN WAY COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE THE OTHER WAY COULD BE THE MOST AND BUY AND BOUNDED JOCKEY OF ALL TIME
THE KIND OF TINGLING NATURE IT'S LIKE DOING A MASSIVE GIG YOU KNOW YOU'RE THERE THINKING THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST THING EVER BUT WHY AM I DOING IT IS SO MUCH PAIN INVOLVED IT'S THAT KIND OF FEELING OF QUICK PREDICTION IN THE SCHOOL

JOSTLING AND PUSHING AND TUGGING AND ENGLAND DON'T ALWAYS DO THAT BUT SINCE THEY'VE COME UNDER READY JONES SHITTER LIVES THEY DO AND THEY MAKE THAT DIFFICULT THEY'RE AGGRESSIVE ABRASIVE THERE IN THE FACES OF THE OPPOSITION IS A PHYSICAL DOMINATION THEY WANT AND CHECKER WAS NOT SO MUCH SURPRISED OR SHOCKED BUT IT'S A CENTRAL IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE THAT ENGLAND DOMINATE WE HAD NEWS YESTERDAY THAT GEORGE FORD OR START AT FLY HALF FOR ENGLAND ARE THEY LIKELY TO BE ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THE STARTING LINE UP

DIVERS HAVE FOUND THE BODY OF A TWO YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS KILLED BY AN ALLIGATOR BOAT DISNEYWORLD IN FLORIDA THE CHART WAS DRAGGED INTO THE WATER WHILE PLAYING ON THE SHORE OF THE LAGOON
TWO LEADING HEALTH ORGANISATIONS ACCORDING FOR DRUG USED TO BE DECRIMINALISED IN THE U.K. THROW SOCIETY OF A PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE FACULTY ARE PUBLIC HEALTH SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S WAR ON DRUGS HAS SPARE SAILED AND THEY SHOULD BE MORE FOCUS ON TREATMENT AND EDUCATION THE HOME OFFICE HAS DEPENDED IT'S RECORD SAYING DRUG MISUSE HAS DECLINED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS
A THIRD WOMAN HAS ALLEGED SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED BY THEIR LATE LIBERAL M.P. AND BROADCASTER SIR CLEMENT FREUD VICKY HAYES WHO'S SIXTY FOUR SAYS THE POLITICIAN RAPED HER IN THE MID NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN
THANK YOU COREY IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT IT IS A DECISION THAT IS DIVIDING THE COUNTRY TEARING THE TORY PARTY APART AND A SPLIT ASUNDER TOO WANTS CLOSE POLITICAL ALLIES AND FRIENDS MEN WHOSE FAMILIES HOLIDAYED TOGETHER AND YOU SHARE TABLES AT THEIR CHILDREN SCHOOL QUIZZES THEY ARE DAVID CAMERON THE LEADER OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND MICHAEL GAVE WHO'D LAST NIGHT WALKED INTO THE QUESTION TIME STUDIO TO MAKE THE CASE FOR LEAVE
LEAVING THE E.U. ARE PLEASE WELCOME THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL
IN A FEW DAYS' TIME IT WILL BE DAVID CAMERON'S TURN THEY WERE ONCE THE CLOSEST OF FRIENDS THAN OUR POLITICAL ENEMIES LOCKED IN A BATTLE WHICH WILL SHAPE NOT JUST THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY BUT COULD TERMINATE THE CAREER OF THE PRIME MINISTER
I THINK IT'S VERY PAINFUL FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED DANNY LORD FINKELSTEIN THE TIMES COLUMNIST AND FRIEND OF THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTING DAVID CAMERON'S LEADERSHIP ELECTION CAMPAIGN THE BEGINNING TWO OF THE KEY PLAYERS MICHAEL ON BORIS ARE NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE IN A BIG DECISION AND WHICH DAVID CAMERON'S FUTURE DOES DEPENDS SUDDENLY THIS IS COME BETWEEN THEM I DON'T THINK PARTICULARLY ON DAVID'S SIDE THE ANTICIPATED THAT
TO THE PUBLIC BORIS JOHNSON MAY SEEM TO BE THE FACE OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BUT IN PRIVATE MICHAEL GAVE IS ITS BRAIN IT WAS HIS DECISION TO SPLIT WITH DAVID CAMERON THAT TRANSFORM THIS REFERENDUM WRITER PETRONELLA WYATT HAS KNOWN BOTH MEN SINCE THEY WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES
YOU WAS THE FIRST SENIOR TOUR HAD COME UP A BRECHT IT SO YOU STOLE A MARCH ON BORIS YUP THAT WAS A THUNDERBOLT TANKS ON CAMERON'S LAWN AND THOSE TANKS HAVE BEEN EXCHANGING HEAVY ARTILLERY
THE INN CAMPAIGN WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT BRITAIN IS BEATEN AND BROKEN AND IF WE DARE TO ASSERT OURSELVES THAN ALL THE TERRORS OF THE EARTH WILL BE UNLEASHED UPON A HEAD OR LEAVE CAMPAIGN RESORTING TO TOTAL UNTRUTHS TO CON PEOPLE INTO TAKING A LEAP IN THE DARK
LIARS DEFEATISTS TRAITORS NOT WORDS NORMAL PEOPLE USE THEM OUT THEY'RE FRIENDS BUT THEN OF COURSE POLITICIANS AREN'T NORMAL PEOPLE PERHAPS YOU MAY BE THINKING THEY'RE NOT REALLY FRIENDS AT ALL BUT YOU'D BE WRONG STEVE HILTON WAS ONCE DAVID CAMERON'S CLOSEST ADVISER IN NUMBER TEN
IT'S A DEEP FRIENDSHIP IT'S ABOUT SPENDING TIME TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES WITH THEIR CHILDREN GOING ON HOLIDAY TOGETHER AND THEY LOVE LOADS OF THINGS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS IN FACT THE FRIENDSHIP PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN DERIVE I WOULD SAY FROM POLITICS DERIVES FROM SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER THAN
AND YET ACTUALLY THEY'RE VERY VERY DIFFERENT POLITICALLY DAVID LAWS WAS MICHAEL GOES LIB DEM DEPUTY AT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
DAVID CAMERON IS A NATURAL SMALL C. CONSERVATIVE OF THE SORT OF HAROLD MACMILLAN TYPE HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN STIRRING THINGS UP TOO MUCH MICHAEL IS NOT A SMALL C. CONSERVATIVE AT ALL HE IS A CAPITAL A RADICAL I MEAN ONE CONSERVATIVE M.P. I THINK DESCRIBED MICHAEL IT'S LIKE A MIXTURE OF JEEVES AND CHE GUEVARA THE MAN WHO HAD NOT ONLY MARGARET THATCHER'S PICTURE ON THE WALL BUT LENIN AND MALCOLM X.
IT IS THIS GOLF IN THEIR OUTLOOK MORE THAN ANY POLICY DIFFERENCE WHICH LIES AT THE ROOT OF THE GOES CAMERON SPLIT SAYS STEVE HILTON
DAVID CAMERAS APPROACH TO GOVERNMENT IS TO BE A RESPONSIBLE STEWARD OF THE NATION'S AFFAIRS TO HAND THINGS ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION IN GOOD ORDER MICHAEL I THINK GOES ABOUT THINGS WITH A VIEW THAT THEY NEED TO BE BIG DRAMATIC CHANGES BECAUSE THINGS AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH
STEVE HILTON AND DANNY FINKELSTEIN WERE FOUNDER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THE PLOTTED THE REINVENTION OF THE TORY BRAND IN THE ERA WHEN TONY BLAIR HAD TURN THEIR PARTY INTO AN IRRELEVANT SIDESHOW
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DEFINITELY POLITICAL ALLIES AND HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THEIR POLITICAL INSTINCTS AND WAYS OF OPERATING A DIFFERENT AND I THINK THAT DID SHOW ITSELF IN THE CHOICES THEY'VE MADE OVER EUROPE IT'S A TINY CRACK BETWEEN THEIR WAYS OF WORKING AND THEIR POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES AND IS OFTEN THE CASE LIKE A LITTLE CHIP IN A WINDSHIELD IT CAN CRACK
AND CRACK IT CERTAINLY HAS AND PERHAPS MICHAEL GAVE ALWAYS SENSE THAT IT MIGHT HE SEES HIMSELF LESS AS A LATTER DAY REVOLUTIONARY MORE AS A REAL WORLD TYRIAN LA MISTER FROM THE FANTASY SERIES GAME OF THRONES THIS MISSHAPEN DWARF REVILED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE FORCE IN THE EYES OF SOME TO BE A TOXIC FIGURE COME AT LAST RALLY A SMALL BAND OF LOYAL FOLLOWERS
THAT IS HOW GOES ONCE DESCRIBED HIS FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN HIS FAVOURITE T. V. DRAMA THE OH SO POLITICAL GAME OF THRONES WAS HE IN REALITY DESCRIBING HIMSELF
TO GO FOR YOU CANNOT FAIL TO BE AWARE THAT THE MORALE OF THE PROFESSION IS AT AN ALL TIME
A TOXIC FIGURE REVILED PRECISELY HOW GAVE CAME TO BE SEEN AS EDUCATION SECRETARY PRECISELY WHY HE WAS SACKED FROM THE JOB BY HIS FRIEND THE PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMERON HAS SPENT THE DAY MAKING SWINGEING CHANGES TO HIS CABINET AND AMONG JUNIOR MINISTERS THE HIGHEST PROFILE MOVE INVOLVES MICHAEL GOES WHO LEAVES EDUCATION TO BECOME CHIEF WHIP WHEN GAVE WAS MADE CHIEF WHIP DAVID CAMERON A FELLOW GAME OF THRONES FIRM TOLD HIM HE'D BE THAT HAND OF THE KING IN OTHER WORDS HIS CLOSEST ADVISER THERE WAS JUST ONE PROBLEM WE IN THE MEDIA WERE TOLD GO THERE'D BEEN DEMOTED HE WAS NOT A FULL MEMBER OF THE CABINET HE WOULD TAKE A SALARY CUT
DEMOTION EMOTION PRO MOTION LOCOMOTION I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DESCRIBE THIS MOVE THOUGH MOVE IT IS ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO SERVE THAT'S HOW GRR OVERREACTED ON RADIO FOR HIS WIFE THE MAIL COLUMNIST SARAH VINE WAS A LITTLE LESS CODED REMEMBER
SHE'S GODMOTHER TO THE CAMERONS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SHE TWEETED A LINK TO AN ARTICLE BY A FELLOW HACK A SHABBY DAY'S WORK WHICH CAMERON WILL LIVE TO REGRET GOES DEPUTY IN THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT DAVID LAWS REMEMBERS THAT DAY ALL TOO CLEARLY
MICHAEL HAD BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL EDUCATION SECRETARY FRIEND OF THE PRIME MINISTER BUT AFTER THE RESHUFFLE WHO DIDN'T COME BACK INTO THE DEPARTMENT ALL OF HIS POSSESSIONS WERE BOXED UP AND DISAPPEARED OUT OF HIS OFFICE WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES OF THE RESHUFFLE
PETRONELLA WYATT'S IN NO DOUBT THE WAY GOPHERS TREATED WAS A FACTOR MY CALL REALLY CHEF DECISION WITH REGARD TO LOYALTY TO CAMERON CAMERON
HAD STOPPED BEHAVING LIKE A FRANK YOU STOP DESERVING THAT LOYALTY EVERYONE EXPECTS TO BE SACKED FROM THE TIME THAT IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE THINGS
IS THE BRUSH
I BELIEVE IT CAMERON HAS BEEN CHEATING HIM A BIT LIKE AN UNDER BUTLER
AND YET FOR A LONG LONG TIME BEFORE THIS REFERENDUM WAS CALLED MICHAEL GAVE INSISTED IN PRIVATE THAT HE WOULD NOT COULD NOT ABANDON HIS FRIEND THAT IS WHAT HE TOLD HER LUNCH ORGANISED BY RUPERT MURDOCH'S NEWS YOU KAY IT LED MURDOCH TO USE TWITTER AND EDITORIALS IN THE SUN TO URGE THE MAN HE ONCE EMPLOYED TO PUT LOYALTY TO HIS PRINCIPLES FIRST AND THIS IS HOW GOES WIFE SARAH VINE WROTE ABOUT HIS STRUGGLE
MICHAEL HAS BEEN LIKE A CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF LOCKED IN AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE OF AGONISING PROPORTIONS THE P.M. WAS GENUINELY AND QUITE NATURALLY SHOCKED AND HURT
IT WAS A DECISION THAT DIDN'T JUST HURT DAVID CAMERON HORACE HORACE HE CONVINCED THE MAN WHO CONFESSED HE'D BEEN VEERING ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE A SHOPPING TROLLEY TO VEER TOWARDS BRICKS IT THE LAST THING I WANTED WAS TO GO AGAINST DAVID CAMERON ALL THE GOVERNMENT IT WAS A DINNER WITH MICHAEL GO THAT BORIS JOHNSON'S HOUSE WHICH LED JOHNSON TO FINALLY DECLARE FOR LEAVE
IT'S A DINNER THE MAY HAVE HELPED TO SEAL THEIR FATE NOT JUST OF BRITAIN BUT OF DAVID CAMERON AS WELL OR COULD FRIENDS BE REUNITED AFTER NEXT WEEK'S RESULT
DANNY FINKELSTEIN I SUSPECT THAT AFTER THE REFERENDUM VOTE IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME YOU WILL GET MUCH MORE OF A REAL ALLIANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE THAN YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE IF CAMERON WENT WELL IF THEY BECOME A DOESN'T WIN THE QUESTION OF WHO SPLITS FOR DAVID CAMERON CEASES TO BE AN OPERATIVE ISSUE AS HE WILL BECOME I BELIEVE SO
THE HISTORIAN OF THE OCCUPANTS OF TEN DOWNING STREET ANTHONY SELDON IS AN UNAPOLOGETIC ADMIRER OF THE EDUCATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY DESPITE ALL GOES DENIALS OF INTEREST SELDEN SEES HIM AS A FUTURE PRIME MINISTER
I THINK THAT MICHAEL SEES HIMSELF WITH THE QUALITIES THE LEADERSHIP I MEAN HE IS A VERY EXCITING UNUSUAL THINKER WITH VERY CONSIDERABLE POWERS OF PERSUASION AT CHANGING AGENDAS I DON'T THINK IT'S HIS GOVERNING DESIRE TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER I THINK HE IS A VERY INTELLECTUALLY DREW WITH AND AS WE'VE SEEN HERE OVER
BRECK'S IT IT IS THE IDEOLOGY THAT TRUMPS THE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP NOT JUST BETWEEN THE TWO MEN BETWEEN THEIR WIVES ALSO
IN JUST SEVEN DAYS' TIME THE COUNTRY WILL DECIDE WHETHER GAVE TRUMPS CAMERON WHICH FRIEND WILL WIN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN
AND DAVID CAMERON'S APPEARANCE ON QUESTION TIME IS THIS SUNDAY EVENING IT'S EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS IN THE SKETCH WRITERS ARE SPOILT FOR CHOICE WITH WHAT'S A PHILIP GREEN'S DRAMATIC APPEARANCE BEFORE M.P.S INSIDE A WESTMINSTER COMMITTEE ROMANDA BIZARRE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SIR BOB GELDOF OR NIGEL FARRELL'S BARRAGE RIVAL ARMADAS OUTSIDE ON THE THAMES
IT'S A BOBBY FEATURES MOST PROMINENTLY ON THE FRONT PAGES ENTHUSIASTICALLY FLICKING OF VISA V. SIGN AT MY BARRAGES BRECK'S IT FLAGSHIP FROM THE DECK OF A PLEASURE CRUISER WHERE HE SURROUNDED BY EXCITED REMAIN SUPPORTERS IN THE TELEGRAPH MICHAEL DEACON SAYS THE DAY WILL SURELY GO DOWN IN BRITISH NAVAL HISTORY IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND ITS COMMONWEALTH LAST FOR A THOUSAND YEARS MEN WILL SAY THIS WAS THEIR WEIRDEST
FOR THE DAILY MAIL ME AND WHILE QUENTIN LETTS WAS LISTENING TO WHAT HE CALLS SIX HOURS OF ME HE'S ALL MIDDLE FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN WHO IS BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF B.H.S. SIR PHILLIPE SAYS GLARED AND M.P.S SCREWED HIS TANNED FACE INTO A WALNUT SHELL OF DISDAIN THE TIME SAYS THE MAN ONCE KNOWN AS THE KING OF RETAIL WAS ANYTHING BUT REGAL ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN HE RELIED ON A MIXTURE OF STRATEGIC AMNESIA
AND INJURED INNOCENCE TO DEFLECT QUESTIONING THEIR SON THINKS IT BEGGARED BELIEF THAT SIR PHILIP DIDN'T NOTICE A HALF BILLION POUND HOLE IN HIS COMPANY'S PENSION FUND IT CALLS FOR HIM TO BE STRIPPED OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD UNLESS B.H.S. PENSIONERS GET EVERY PENNY THEY'RE DUE SO PHILIP'S NOT THE ONLY ONE GETTING A BAD PRESS GEORGE OSBORNE'S WARNINGS OF TAX RISES AND SPENDING CUTS AFTER A BRECK'S IT VOTE ARE DESCRIBED AS
SAD MISJUDGMENT BY THE TELEGRAPH VOTERS IT SAYS DO NOT APPRECIATE HYSTERICAL POLITICIANS TREATING THEM LIKE FOOLS THE ELVIS IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THE CHANCELLOR CAN SURVIVE THE BLOW HE'S INFLICTING ON TORY UNITY AND HIS OWN CREDIBILITY THE SUN CALLS IT CALLS THE BRICKS IT BUDGET A SHAMEFUL THREAT FINALLY THE MALE REPORTS THE WOMAN WHO BAKES CAKES IN THE SHAPE OF DOGS AND CATS PENGUINS AND OTHER CREATURES HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF ENCOURAGING CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HANNAH EDWARDS FROM HERTFORDSHIRE
SO SHE GOT COMPLAINTS WHEN SHE POSTED IMAGES ON FACEBOOK OF HER LIFE LIKE RE CREATIONS BEING SLICED WITH A KNIFE MISS EDWARDS WHO SPENDS UP TO EIGHTY HOURS SCORCHING SPONGES SAYS HER PHOTOS HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR GRAPHIC VIOLENCE BUT THE SOCIAL NETWORKERS CONCLUDED THEY DON'T BREAK ANY OF ITS RULES
TIME NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THEY ARE NOT JUST THINGS OF GREAT BEAUTY THEY'RE ALSO VITAL MARINE STRUCTURES AND THERE IS SOME SURPRISINGLY GOOD NEWS ABOUT THEM THE WORLD'S CORAL REEFS MAY NOT AFTER ALL
BE DYING JOINING US ON THE LINE DOCTOR CHRISTINA HICKS THE ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL SCIENTIST AT LANCASTER UNIVERSITY'S ENVIRONMENT CENTRE AND HIS CO AUTHOR OF THE STUDY THAT REVEALED THAT SHE IS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LANCASTER ON SAYING GOOD MORNING TO YOU DOCTOR HICKS GOOD MORNING THIS IS GENUINELY RATHER EXCITING NEWS IF IT PROVES THAT THE CORALS OR NOT IN AS BAD AWAY AS WE FEARED THEY WERE
WELL WE ARE VERY EXCITED BY THE RESULTS DEFINITELY I THINK IT THEY CERTAINLY OFFER PROMISING SOLUTIONS TO LOCAL MANAGEMENT ON THE WORLD'S CORAL REEFS SO HOW DO YOU TELL IS IT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FISH THAT AROUND THE CORAL IS STUDYING THE CORAL ITSELF
SO I SUPPOSE I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY WE WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF FISH SO THE CORAL REEFS ARE UNDER CONSIDERABLE THREAT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE THREE MAIN DRIVERS AND WE KNOW THAT WHERE FISH NUMBERS ARE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED REEFS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PAM BACK
SO WE WERE IN SO THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR COLLABORATIVE STUDY THAT INVOLVED SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD IN WHICH WE WERE LOOKING FOR WHAT WE CALL THESE BRIGHT SPOT SO THEIR REEFS THAT WERE DOING BETTER THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED GIVEN THEIR BACKGROUND CONDITIONS AND DO WE KNOW WHY
YES WE DO ACTUALLY WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE REEFS THAT ARE DOING BETTER THAN EXPECTED SO THESE ARE NOT REEFS THAT ARE ALL HIGH BIOMASS BUT THEY'RE ACROSS THE RANGE
TEND TO HAVE STRETCHED STRONGER LOCAL MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS AND SO THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN PARTICIPATING AND MANAGING AND MAKING DECISIONS AROUND THEIR RESOURCES THERE ALSO STRONGER TRADITIONS TO THE SEA SO PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP SO WHAT SORT OF THINGS ARE PEOPLE DOING WHERE THERE ARE THESE BRIGHT SPOTS THAT YOU WOULD NOW URGE PEOPLE TO DO MORE OF SO THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE CAR
BUT I THINK THE MAIN MESSAGE REALLY IS TO INVEST IN AN ENGAGEMENT SO THEY REALLY ENCOURAGE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND WHY
DOCTOR CHRISTINA HICKS AT LANCASTER UNIVERSITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FORTY MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS JAZZ VIA SEEING CO CHAIRS THE FAITHS FORUM FOR LONDON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS SIKHS AROUND THE WORLD HAVING MARKING AN IMPORTANT ANNIVERSARY MAINLY THE DEATH OF THE FIFTH GEARING IT'S A MOMENT WHICH CHANGED THE COMMUNITY FOREVER IN SIXTEEN OH SIX DIGGORY WAS ARRESTED BY THE MOGUL AUTHORITIES VARIOUS REASONS WERE GIVEN FOR HIS DETENTION HE WAS TORTURED HORRIBLY TORN TO RENOUNCE HIS FAITH AND WHEN HE REFUSED HE WAS KILLED HE BECAME THE FIRST PERSON TO DIE SIMPLY FOR BEING SIKH
THE COMMUNITY WAS COMPLETELY DEVASTATED BY THIS BUT BIGGER HIS SON WHO IN TURN HAD BECOME THE SEX GURU ENSURED THAT THE COLLECTIVE GRIEF DEVELOPED INTO A SOURCE OF STRENGTH TO SHOW THAT SIKHS WOULDN'T BE DOWNTRODDEN BY OTHERS AND ULTIMATELY TRANSFORM THE SIKH COMMUNITY INTO THEIR RELIGION IT IS TODAY A FAITH WILLING TO FIGHT FOR TRUE QUALITY FOR REGARDLESS OF PEOPLE'S BACKGROUNDS OR BELIEFS
THAT COLLECTIVE RESPONSE TO A TRAGIC EVENT IS SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN THIS WEEK ON MONDAY EVENING SOHO IN CENTRAL LONDON CAME TO A STANDSTILL AS THOUSANDS GATHERED TO REMEMBER THE FORTY NINE GAY MEN AND WOMEN KILLED IN ORLANDO AT THE WEEKEND MANY PEOPLE FROM FAITH COMMUNITIES ATTENDED THE VEG INCLUDING FROM MY OWN ORGANISATION THE FATES FORM FOR LONDON IT WAS A DEEPLY MOVING SHOW OF STRENGTH AND DEFIANCE AGAINST THOSE WHO WANT TO TEAR COMMUNITIES APART WITH HATRED THE LOCATION WAS POIGNANT
THE VIGIL CENTRED ON THE GAY PUB WHERE THE LONDON NAIL BOMBER HAD KILLED THREE PEOPLE JUST SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THAT ATTACK DAVID COPELAND HAD BOMBED THE DIVERSE AREAS OF BRIXTON AND BRICK LANE LEADING TO COUNTLESS INJURIES HIS NEXT TARGET WOULD'VE BEEN SOUTHALL HAME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST CALLED GLASS IN EUROPE
IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF AN ATROCITY FOR US TO LOOK BEYOND GRIEF AND ANGER EMOTIONS ARE STILL RAW ESPECIALLY WHEN A COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TARGETED SIMPLY FOR BEING TRUE TO ITSELF
LOOK SOCIETY'S COLLECTIVE RESPONSE CAN CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM THOSE WHO WANT TO SPREAD HATRED AND FEAR
TO MARK THE FIFTH GEAR IS DEATH SIKHS GIVE COLD DRINKS TO PEOPLE PASSING OUTSIDE GOD TO US TO REMEMBER THE GARREY'S THIRST WHILST BEING TORTURED AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHERS DON'T SUFFER LIKE HEAT DEAD LOVED STRENGTH AND COMPASSION NOT FEAR IS WHAT EMERGED FROM THAT TRAGEDY
AT TIMES LIKE THIS ALL COMMUNITIES MUST COME TOGETHER TO SHOW THEY AREN'T SCARED OR FRIGHTENED BY THE SENSELESS ACTS OF THE FEW THAT WILL FIGHT FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IS RIGHT AND JUST
THE LAST LIVING SEAT DURING DINNER GO BEEN SAYING PUT IT WELL WHEN HE SAID OH LORD GRANT ME THE SPLEEN BUT I'M HER NEIGHBOUR REFRAIN FROM RIGHTFUL DEEDS
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AS A SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSE TO THE ORLANDO SHOOTINGS HAS MADE VERY CLEAR LOVE WINS
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE JAZZ WIR SING IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT EDWARD MALLON WAS A GIFTED AND POPULAR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HE JUST BEEN OFFERED A PLACE AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY WHEN HE WENT TO SEE HIS G.P. TO SAY HE WAS DEPRESSED AND FELT SUICIDAL HE'S DOCTOR RECOMMENDED HE BE SEEN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT A MENTAL HEALTH NURSE DOWNGRADED THAT ADVICE HE WAS GIVEN STRONG ANTI DEPRESSANTS BUT NOT WARNED OF THE SIDE EFFECTS
ALTHOUGH HE'D GIVEN CONSENT FOR HIS PARENTS TO BE TOLD ABOUT HIS SUICIDAL THOUGHTS THEY NEVER WERE AND A LETTER FOR HIS NEXT APPOINTMENT WAS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS
HE KILLED HIMSELF THREE WEEKS AFTER FIRST SEEING HIS G.P. THE CORONER HAS NOW RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT G.P.S NOT TAKING ADVICE ON MEDICATION FROM CLINICAL PSYCHIATRISTS WELL WE'RE JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY EDWARD'S FATHER STEVE MALLON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND YOU MADE A PUBLIC
PROMISE AT EDWARD'S FUNERAL THAT YOU WOULD LOOK INTO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PRESUMABLY THAT WAS BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS WENT WRONG IN HIS CASE YES OF COURSE I STOOD NEXT TO MY SON'S COFFIN IN CHURCH AND I MADE HIM A PUBLIC PROMISE TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE HIS DEMISE AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE SECTOR WHICH HITHERTO I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW A VERY GREAT DEAL ABOUT AS MOST OF US DON'T AND THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT
AND I'VE SPENT THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND THIS SECTOR AND TO UNDERSTAND HIS TRAGEDY AND IN HIS CASE HAD HE HAD ANY PREVIOUS HISTORY OF DEPRESSION NOT THAT WE WERE PARTICULARLY AWARE OF I CAN'T EMPHASISE STRONGLY ENOUGH HOW WONDERFUL AND GIFTED AND TALENTED EDWARD WAS IT HAS BECOME A FAMOUS CASE AND PEOPLE CAN READ ABOUT IT WHAT A STRONG AND FABULOUS YOUNG MAN HE WAS
HE WANTS HIM TO HAVE THE WORLD AT HIS FEET INDEED INDEED AND WHAT THIS VERY PAINFULLY AND POIGNANTLY REMINDS US OF IS THAT MENTAL ILLNESS IS A DISEASE IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSICAL ILLNESS AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND AS WITH ANY DISEASE IT IS INDISCRIMINATE IN HER IS THAT IT TOUCHES IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW STRONG AND RESILIENT AND STRONG THE FAMILY BACKGROUND MIGHT BE A DISEASE CAN STRIKE ANYBODY NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT OF COURSE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES
PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHICH CAN OBVIOUSLY LEAD AND PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER AS WELL BUT WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THAT MENTAL ILLNESS CAN AFFECT ANYONE AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS CASE AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM RECOGNISES THAT
IN WHAT WAY WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO PROMPT YOU TO SAY THAT WELL OBVIOUSLY IN THE PRESENT ENVIRONMENT THE N.H.S. SYSTEM IS SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY FUNDING AND RESOURCES AS WE KNOW UNACCEPTABLE WAITING TIMES THE BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING CARE OR EVER HIGHER AND HIGHER AND SO IN THAT SENSE THE END IN THE N.H.S. OBVIOUSLY HAS TO EMPLOY RISK MODELS TO THOSE TO WHOM THEY THINK ARE AT RISK ESSENTIALLY AND AT THE PRESENT TIME ONLY ONE IN FOUR
OF THE PEOPLE THAT REQUIRE TREATMENT ARE ACCESSING THAT CARE THAT HE'S OBVIOUSLY UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT MEANS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VARIOUS GRADE ASIANS OF SEVERITY OF ILLNESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE ALSO SOCIO ECONOMIC FACTORS WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO PLAY
AND I DO THINK THAT MAYBE IS AN ISSUE IN THIS CASE AND I KNOW ONE OF YOUR ARGUMENTS PARTICULARLY IS THAT IF YOU GET IT EARLY ENOUGH IT IS FAR MORE TREATABLE WELL THERE'S A VERY LARGE DYNAMIC HERE I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THAT SIR SIMON STEVENS THE HEAD OF THE N.H.S. JUST RECENTLY GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE WHERE HE'S SAID THAT DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT'S PROMISES TO PAUL VERY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR SO IT WILL STILL BE A KNOT
NOT ENOUGH TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM SO THE ONE IN FOUR RATIO MIGHT MOVE TO ONE IN THREE THAT MIGHT BRING CARE INTO FOR ANOTHER SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT IS GOOD THAT IS POSITIVE BUT IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH KNOW WHAT THAT LEADS ME ON TO IS THAT WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE THE N.H.S. LESS TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE'S A VERY LARGE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED BODY OF ACADEMIC AND MEDICAL RESEARCH WHICH PROVES CATEGORICALLY
THAT'S PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IN MENTAL ILLNESS IS ENTIRELY ACHIEVABLE MUCH MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND OBVIOUSLY WILL PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO WORK OUT THAT IF WE CAN GIVE THE N.H.S. LESS TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE WE WAS SAKE A VERY GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND PRODUCE A HAPPIER SOCIETY THE FACTOR THAT EDWARD WAS EIGHTEEN MEANT THAT HE WAS TREATED AS AN ADULT AND THAT IN A WAY
COMPOUNDED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS DIDN'T IT WELL WE WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF NARRATIVE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE HEALTH AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM MEANS THAT THERE IS A DISJOINTED AND AMBIGUOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TRANSITION FROM CHILD TO ADULT HOOD HE WAS ONLY SIX WEEKS AFTER HIS EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY
AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE CASE THAT WERE HE SEVEN WEEKS YOUNGER THE OUTCOME OF THE SITUATION MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A COMPLICATED LEGAL ISSUE BUT AS ONE AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS THAT FOR AN UNDER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO BE PRESCRIBED THE DRUGS THAT HE WAS HE WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO BEEN REFERRED TO A CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST INDEED ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS THE EDWARDS CASE HIGHLIGHTS A NUMBER OF ONGOING ISSUES WHICH ARE COMMON THREADS IN MANY OF THESE APPALLING TRAGEDIES
ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS IN ADOLESCENCE WHICH IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT OF WHICH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE MEDICAL DISAGREEMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF ISSUES RELATING TO FAMILY CONSENT CONTINUITY OF CARE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THE PROBLEM WITH THESE IS THAT WE KEEP HEARING THESE STORIES EVERY DAY THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN PEOPLE TOOK THEIR LIVES ON THE RAILWAY LAST YEAR AND SO ON
STEVE MEL AND JUST STAY THERE FROM NICK COS WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN DOCTOR ANDY WE KNOW WHO'S HER CONSULTANT CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIST AT THE TAV OR STOP COMPORTMENT N.H.S. FOUNDATION TRUST DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY OF COURSE THAN WEAR THEM WHERE YOU LIVE AND AND DOCTOR WE KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE VERY AWARE OF THIS MOVE INTO ADULT HOOD WHERE THERE ARE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH
YES INDEED IT'S AN AREA THAT I FEEL VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH COLLEAGUES IN ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE CAMDEN ISLINGTON MENTAL HEALTH TRUST AND ALSO WITH THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR TO TRY AND IMPROVE THE APPROACH THAT'S TAKEN WITH YOUNG PEOPLE PRESENTING WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WHAT WHY IS THAT WHAT ARE THE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HIT EIGHTEEN
WELL OH I MEANT TO SAY BY THE WAY THAT MY I'D LIKE TO EXTEND MY SYMPATHIES TO MY UM ALLEN AND HIS FAMILY IT'S A TERRIBLY SORT OF TRAGIC AND PAINFUL SITUATION WHEN WHEN A YOUNG PERSON TAKES OUR LIVES THANK YOU
THE PREDICAMENT I MEAN THERE IS THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN THERE'S PRINT RESPONSIBILITIES SO ANY CLINICIAN WHO WAS DOING AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT WOULD BE LEGALLY BOUND TO INFORM THE PARENTS UNLESS THE YOUNG PERSON STRONGLY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED
AND IT'S CORRECT THAT OVER EIGHTEEN THE SORT OF PREVAILING CULTURE WITHIN ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS THAT THEY SEE THEIR PATIENT DOESN'T INDIVIDUAL AND THEY'RE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO INVOLVE THE PARENTS WE HAVEN'T GOT VERY LONG IS IT DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE EFFECTIVELY TREATING EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS MORE AS ADOLESCENCE THAN ADULTS YES ABSOLUTELY I MEAN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LESS DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH MORE OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH
SO THAT IT'S RECOGNISE THEY'RE PART OF FAMILIES PART OF COMMUNITIES SO WE HAVE TRANSITION CHAMPIONS IN OUR SERVICES SO WE'VE GOT CHARM ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH STAFF WORKING IN ADULT SERVICES TO TRY TO CHANGE THE CULTURE WITHIN THE ADULT SERVICES TO MAKE THEM MORE AWARE OF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT AND HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS THEY NEED TO BE REACHED OUT TO THE RISK FACTORS ARE DIFFERENT THEY'RE MORE IMPULSIVE FOR EXAMPLE
STEVE MALLON DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE TO EDWARD THAT SORT OF THING YES I SUSPECT IT PROBABLY WOULD I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF CONTINUITY OF CARE IT SHOULDN'T PARTICULARLY MATTER HOW OLD ONE IS WHEN ONE IS AFFECTED BY MENTAL ILLNESS THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES HERE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN A YOUNG PERSON IN PARTICULAR HAS A HAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER THEY NEED TO DEVELOP RAPPORT AND EMPATHY WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN IN THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT TRANSITION FROM CHILD TO ADULT

A WEEK BEFORE POLLING DAY LORD'S LAMONT LAWSON AND HOWARD AND IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BABY TELEGRAPH ARGUING THAT THE DEBATE ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES THAT LEAVING THE E.U. HAS BEEN FULL OF STARTLING DISHONESTY THE PRIME MINISTER HAS RESPONDED BY ACCUSING THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN OF UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HE'S A ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
TODAY'S LETTER NOT ONLY CONTAINS ANOTHER WITHERING ATTACK ON THE CHANCELLOR FOLLOWING HIS SO CALLED BRECHT'S HAD BUDGET WHICH THEY DISMISS AS A LUDICROUS SCAREMONGERING BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS A FEROCIOUS ASSAULT ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE TREASURY AND OTHER OFFICIAL SOURCES BEFORE SENIOR CONSERVATIVES ACCUSED THESE ORGANISATIONS OF STARTLING DISHONESTY AND A WOEFUL FAILURE TO PRESENT A FAIR AND BALANCED ANALYSIS
DOWNING STREET WARNED THE CRITICISM RISKED UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN SUCH INDEPENDENT BODIES WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER EXPRESSED HIS DEEP CONCERN BUT THIS MORNING THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD DEFENDED THE LETTER AND SAID THERE WERE ONLY THREE RELIABLE FACTS IN THIS REFERENDUM NUMBER ONE IF WE LEAVE WE WON'T HAVE TO PAY BILLIONS OF POUNDS INTO THE COFFERS OF THE E.U. NUMBER TWO WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR IMMIGRATION AGAIN

WOULD POSE A GRAVE THREAT TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT MESSAGE WILL BE ECHOED LATER THIS MORNING BY THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL AND THE FORMER CHANCELLOR AND PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN WHO WILL SHARE A STAGE IN MANCHESTER A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN ONCE AND REPORTS
THE LEADERS OF THE TEN LABOUR CONTROLLED CITIES INCLUDING BIRMINGHAM LIVERPOOL NEWCASTLE FIRST WARNED OF THE RISKS OF LEAVING THE E.U. IN FEBRUARY BUT AS POLLING DAY APPROACHES RHETORIC HAS BECOME MORE ROBUST THEY SAY F. OUGHT TO LEAVE WOULD PUT CITIES WHICH HAVE BENEFITED FROM E.U. FUNDING IN SERIOUS ECONOMIC DANGER
GORDON BROWN JOHN MCDONNELL WILL ARGUE THAT BILLIONS MORE OF E.U. FUNDING COULD BECOME AVAILABLE TO IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND INDUSTRIAL AND FORMER INDUSTRIAL AREAS OF BRITAIN STAYS IN BUT CRITICS ARGUE THAT MUCH OF THAT FUNDING IS YET TO BE RAISED BY THE E.U. THE PHILIP AT THE SYMBOLISM MARTYRS ALMOST AS MUCH AS A SUBSTANCE MY MCDONNELL FIELD HIM ATTEMPT TO CHALLENGE MY BROWN FOR THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP NEARLY A DECADE AGO SO THE JOINT APPEARANCES DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT THE BREADTH OF SUPPORT FOR E.U. MEMBERSHIP WITHIN LABOUR'S RANKS
THOUGHT LEAVE SAID THE U.K. GOVERNMENT COULD CONTINUE TO GUARANTEE THE CITIES OF FUNDS AT CURRENTLY COME FROM BRUSSELS AND RECYCLING THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE E.U. IS SIMPLY A SIGN OF DESPERATION

IT'S JUST GONE SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AND THE ENGLAND FANS THAT WERE HERE HAVE NOW BEEN MOVED AROUND ONE HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER IN

GOOD MORNING MARTIN GLENN FIRST OF ALL HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE STREETS THEY'RE CONCERN NOT JUST FOR THE FIRMS FOR THE PEOPLE IN REAL BUT OF COURSE FOR THAT THREAT OF DISQUALIFICATION FOR HIM
I THINK THE DISQUALIFICATION THREAT WAS CLEARLY MADE BOTH RUSSIA AND ENGLAND AFTER THE MARSEILLE GOING BACK TO YOU AS YOU ARE NOW
THE CRITICAL OF THE RUSSIAN FOUND BEHAVIOUR IN THE STADIUM AND THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN THAT OTHER ARE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT AS YOUR REPORTER SAID THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT INDEPENDENT SECURITY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THERE
AND WILL GET A FULL REPORT TODAY AS TO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED ALL I'D SAY TO THE FANS IS THIS YOU KNOW THE BIG STORY IN FRANCE YESTERDAY WASN'T WASN'T REALLY FANS IN LILLE IT WAS THE MURDER OF TWO FRENCH POLICEMEN
AND I THINK MESSAGE TO ALL ENGLISH FANS WELSH FANS TO THE FRENCH ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HER A REAL SECURITY THREAT BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY COME AND ENJOY THE GAME

GENERALLY I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEING VERY WELL BEHAVED VERY RESPECTFUL OF THE AUTHORITIES TRYING TO DO THEIR JOB IT'S JUST MINDLESS MINORITY WELL IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THE POSITIVITY YOU'RE MOULTING THEN LET'S HAVE SOME POSITIVELY ABOUT THE FOOT
FOR MOST PEOPLE THIS WILL BE A DAY OF REAL EXCITEMENT AS THEY WATCH THESE TWO TEAMS CLASH NOW INGA WERE BEING TAUNTED YESTERDAY THAT

MARTIN GOING TO THE F.A. ENJOY THE MATCH THAT'S WHAT IT'S A BIT LIKE AFTER ALL
THANKS VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. AND INDEED IF IT VOTES TO STAY AS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE'VE BEEN TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS TO PUT TO OUR OWN EXPERTS ARE SPECIALIST EDITORS AND AS WE'VE DONE BEFORE WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME SNAPPY ANSWERS FROM THEM SO WE CAN COVER AS MUCH GROUND AS POSSIBLE
WE'VE GOT A BEVY OF EXPERTS FOR YOU WHERE NORMAN SMITH OUR SIMPLEST GATHER CATCHER ADLER EUROPE EDITOR SIMON JACK BUSINESS EDITOR COME ALL AHMED ECONOMICS EDITOR AND CLIVE COLEMAN ILLEGAL CORRESPOND AND WE'RE GONNA START WITH CARMEL ON THE ECONOMICS JANEY PEN HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU CAN DO SEASONAL WORKERS TAKE JOBS FROM THE LOCAL POPULATION
WELL NICK THIS GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND CERTAINLY THERE'S PLENTY OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE YOU GO TO ANY FARM ACROSS ENGLAND THEN YOU'LL OFTEN SEE LOTS OF E. U. MIGRANT WORKERS FROM POLAND FROM ELSEWHERE WORKING ON THE FIELDS AND THOSE JOBS TWENTY YEARS AGO WERE DONE IN THE MAIN BY BRITISH WORKERS NOW THE ISSUE HERE IS AROUND THE NUMBER OF E.U. NATIONALS ACTUALLY WORKING IN THE U.K. HAS RISEN TO A RECORD LEVEL OF TWO POINT
ONE MILLION THAT'S GONE UP QUITE STEEPLY SINCE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS UP FROM ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ABOUT SIX POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE BRITISH WORKFORCE AND IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HAS SAID THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM DEPRESSING WAGES AND COMPETING WITH BRITISH WORKERS BUT I THINK THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME THAT EMPLOYMENT IS ACTUALLY NOT ECSTATIC FACTOR IS ACTUALLY BEEN RISING RECENTLY ONE MILLION MORE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE IN JOBS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTY IN THE U.K. HAS BEEN A BIT OF A JOB
FACTORY UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS ARE DOWN TO ITS LOWEST LOWEST NUMBERS SINCE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND FIRE SO ALTHOUGH FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE HAS BROUGHT MORE WORKERS IN TO THE U.K. AND THAT COULD LEAD IN SOME SECTORS TO SOME DISPLACEMENT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS TO GO AROUND COME OFF THANK YOU A QUESTION FROM AMANDA FOR A LEGAL CORRESPONDENT CLIVE COMMON CLIVE AMANDA SAYS SOMEONE MOVING TO AN E.U. STATE HAS THE RIGHT TO DO SERVE THERE AN E.U. CITIZEN BUT THEY DO HAVE TO MEET SOME CONDITIONS
SHOWING THAT THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES NOT LEAST DANCE THAT YOU REQUIRE PEOPLE HERE TO REGISTER THEIR PRESENTS AND GET HER RIGHT TO RESIDE CERTIFICATE AND DO WE EXERT A RIGHT NOW TO ASK THEM TO LEAVE IF THEY HAVEN'T MET THOSE CONDITIONS OH KAY TO ANY NATIONAL CAN COME AND LIVE IN THE U.K. IF YOU WANT TO STAY FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD THEN YOU NEED TO JUSTIFY YOUR PRESENCE HERE BY BEING EITHER A WORKER AN EMPLOYEE A STUDENT WITH ME
OR FINANCIALLY SELF SUFFICIENT NOT A BURDEN ON THE STATE PEOPLE COMING HERE DON'T NEED TO ACQUIRE A RESIDENT'S CARD BUT IT HELPS IF YOU DO COS IT CONFIRMS TO STATE AGENCIES THAT YOU'RE HERE EXERCISING YOUR TREATY RIGHTS IF ANY YOU NATIONAL HASN'T SHOWN WITHIN THREE MONTHS THAT THERE ONE OF THOSE FOUR THINGS EMPLOYEE WORKER EXCEPT FOR THEY CAN BE ARSED TO LEVI REMOVED IT'S PRETTY RARE THAT THAT HAPPENS
THE REAL ISSUE SARAH IS BENEFITS BECAUSE TO GET THEM E.U. NATIONALS HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WORK OR HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR HAVE BECOME GENUINELY UNEMPLOYED AND JUST THIS WEEK THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE UPHELD THE U.K.'S RIGHT TO RESTRICT THE RESTRICT BENEFITS FOR E.U. MIGRANTS WHO ARE NOT CONSIDERED ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE THAT SUMS UP OUR POSITION HERE WE DON'T MIND TOO MUCH YOU COMES IN WE REMOVE VERY FEW BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY BENEFITS IF YOU'RE ECONOMICALLY INACTIVE
RIGHT NORMAN SMITH A QUESTION FOR YOU ANDY ASHTON HAS IF BRICKS IT IS LOOKING MORE LIKELY WHY AREN'T E.U. LEADERS OFFERING MORE CONCESSIONS IF WE STAY AND WHY ISN'T DAVID CAMERON ASKING FOR THEM I THINK ANSWER TO THAT IS IT TOOK MY CAMERON BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS TO GET WHAT HE'S GOT THE PROSPECT THAT HE COULD CROWBAR OUT SOME MORE CONCESSIONS AT THE DEATH I THINK IS PROBABLY
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ADDED TO WHICH IT WOULD REQUIRE ALL TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES TO AGREE TO IT THAT AGAIN EXTRAORDINARILY HARD ANOTHER COUPLE OF REASONS THOUGH I THINK ONE IS THE APPREHENSION IN THE E.U. THAT HAVE THEY START DOLING OUT MORE GOODIES TO MISTER CAMERON THAT SIMPLY ENCOURAGES OTHER COUNTRIES TO THINK WHY DON'T WE DO A BRITON AND JUST THROW OUR WEIGHT AROUND AND SEE WHAT SORT OF
DEAL WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET LAST POINT IS THE ONLY REAL CONCESSIONS I THINK WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THIS REFERENDUM IS SOMETHING ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND THE TWO KEY PILLARS OF THE E.U. NAMELY MISSUS MYRTLE OF FRANCOIS LON ARE ABSOLUTELY IMMOVABLE AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION OF ANY GIVE THEIR NORMAN THANK YOU
SIMON SIMON JACK QUESTION FROM JOHNNY ONE I PARTICULARLY LIKE BECAUSE IT'S SO PERSONAL I WORK FOR A BANK IN THE CITY OF LONDON WITH THE U.K. LEAVES THE E.U. AM I LIKELY TO LOSE MY JOB AND IT DOES GO ON HOW MUCH IN TERMS OF INCOME TAX PAID BY CITY WORKERS IS LIKELY TO BE LOST NOTES THANK YOU JOLLY GOOD GOOD QUESTION NOW BRITISH BANKS CAN PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION AS MUCH AS MEMBERS OF THE OPENING IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE THE RIGHT THAT SWISS OR AMERICAN BANKS CAN DO THE SAME
FROM BRANCHES OR SUBSIDIARIES ESTABLISHED HERE IN THE U.K. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND J.P. MORGAN LOTS OF THESE FOREIGN BANKS CREDIT SWISS YOU B'S ALL HAVE BIG OPERATIONS HERE SO THEY CAN ACCESS THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ELSEWHERE NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY EVEN IF WE LEAVE LONDON'S JUST TOO DOMINANT IT'S CROWDS NOT GOING TO SLIP THIS SUCH A CLUSTER OF EXPERTISE HERE BUT IT'S GOING TO BE FINE OFFICERS
INCLUDING JAMIE DIAMOND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE J.P. MORGAN WHO I INTERVIEWED RECENTLY HE SAYS FOUR THOUSAND OF HIS SIXTEEN THOUSAND JOBS HERE IN THE U.K. COULD GO TO EUROPE IF WE LEAVE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE WORKFORCE
AS FOR TAX THE CITY GENERATES SIXTY FIVE BILLION POUNDS IN TAX REVENUE EVERY YEAR FORTY BILLION OF THAT IS FROM BANKERS INCOME TAX UP CITY PROFESSIONALS INCOME TAX SO IT MAY NOT BE POPULAR BUT THEY COULD FOR THE PUBLIC FINANCES CATCHING OUR EUROPE EDITOR PADDY FINNEGAN HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU CATCHER HAS THE Y. YOU EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LINK TRADE AGREEMENTS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH FREE MOBILITY OF WORKERS IS IT POSSIBLE THE BRICKS IT WOULD LEAVE US IN EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION IN RELATION TO IMMIGRATION AS WE HAVE NOW ONLY WITH LESS NEGOTIATING
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND THEY INSIST THAT THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT ANY FUTURE TRADE DEAL WITH THE E.U. THAT INVOLVES THE FREE MOBILITY OF WORKERS BUT IT HAS HAPPENED WITH OTHERS NORWAY ICELAND SWITZERLAND THESE ARE ALL NON E.U. EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT TAKE PART IN ALL HAVE CLOSE LINKS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET
IN EXCHANGE THEY HAVE HAD TO ACCEPT SOME FORM OF AN OPEN DOOR POLICY FOR E.U. WORKERS AND OTHER E.U. RULES ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE Y. YOU OUTSIDERS THEY DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE DECISION MAKING TABLE BASICALLY THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE Y. U. U. K. TRADE SCENARIOS IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE IT ALL NEEDS TO BE NEGOTIATED AND THOSE NEGOTIATIONS REALLY COULD TAKE YEARS
WELL THAT IS IT A SHORTISH BUT SWEET THANK YOU NORMAN SMITH CATCH ADLER SAIMA JACK COME ON AHMED MICHAEL WE NEED A RED BUTTON SO YOU CAN CARRY ON LISTENING TO THERE'S A RISK THE DAY BABY SITTER INCLUDE A LONGER VERSION ON A WEBSITE YES TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND IT'S TIME FOR THE MORE SPORTS NEWS ALICE MITCHELL'S BACK
THANK YOU GOOD MORNING WELL AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF ANTICIPATION SINCE THE DRAW WAS ANNOUNCED THE DAY HAS FINALLY ARRIVED THE BIGGEST GAME OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN SO FAR FOR ENGLAND AND WALES FANS WHEN THE TEA PLAY EACH OTHER IN GROUP B. AS YOU'VE BEEN HEARING IN THE PROGRAMME THE BUILD UP HAS BEEN MARRED BY TROUBLE IN THE STREETS OF LIL UEFA HAVE RESPONDED SAYING THEY REGRET THE SKIRMISHES WHICH OCCURRED ADDING THAT POLICE FORCES MADE SEVERAL ARRESTS AND WERE QUICK TO RESTORE ORDER AND KEEP THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL
WELL WALES PLAYING IN THEIR FIRST MAJOR TOURNAMENT IN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS CAN REACH THE LAST SIXTEEN WITH VICTORY IN LANCE THEY HAVEN'T BEATEN ENGLAND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE'VE GOT REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH SIDES WITH US FORMER WALES STRIKER JOHN HARTSON AND FORMER ENGLAND DEFENDER DANNY MILLS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RHETORIC IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO HASN'T THERE WITH GARETH BALE SAYING WALES PLAYERS CHEF MORE PASSION THAN ENGLAND DARREN RAMSAY CLAIMING WALES ARE MORE OF A TEAM JOHN IS THIS ALL JUST HOT AIR
WELL WALES ARE VERY CONFIDENT I THINK FOR FOR FOR A LONG TIME WALES V. ENGLAND I THINK THIS PARTICULAR GAME ITSELF WALES THERE IS AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE I THINK THE WAY THEY GOT THROUGH THE QUALIFIERS THE WAY THAT THEY'VE STARTED THE TOURNAMENT WITH A WIN AGAINST SLOVAKIA THEY CURRENTLY ON THREE POINTS
SO YES THEY ARE CONFIDENT THEY REALLY FEEL THEY CAN BEATING THEM BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT IS WELL I THINK THE PRESS HAVE OVERHYPED THINGS
THINGS HAVE BEEN TAKEN UP THE CONTACTS YOU CAN SEE IF GARETH BALE AND RHYMES YOU WERE BOTH LOOKING FOR A BUY THEY'VE GOT A HUGE REACTION FROM ROY HODGSON AND I THINK ENGLAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER AND BETTER THAN TO REACT YOU LOOK AT THE WELSH PLAYERS THERE THEY'RE LAUGHING ABOUT IT THEY CAN ENJOY IT BUT ULTIMATELY YOU CAN DO ALL THE TRASH TALKING TO ALL THE HYPE EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN THE PLAYERS CROSS THAT LYING TODAY IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT TWO SETS OF PLAYERS
AND WHO CAN PERFORM ON THE DAY WHO COULD JUST PRODUCE THAT LITTLE BIT OF MAGIC THERE CAN WIN THE GAME FOR EITHER TEAM AND ALL THE TALK GOES COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WINDOW DANNY HE'S ALL THAT TALK JUST DESIGNED TO RILE AND IF SO IS IT WORKING
I THINK GARETH BALE RAMSEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF A LAUGH YOU LISTEN TO THE TOLL IN THEIR VOICE IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF WATER AT THE PRESSURE IS ALL ON ENGLAND ENGLAND HAVE TO GO AND WIN THIS GAME HER DRAWERS NOT REALLY GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ENGLAND THE WAY THE GROUP SITS AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE WALES WOULD THEN BE ON FOUR POINTS
RUSSIA WALES YOU EXPECT WALES GET A POINT FROM THAT EAMONN SAVAK EST LUCKY YOU HAVE PLAYED WELL UP UNTIL NOW SO THIS IS A MUST WIN GAME FOR ENGLAND THE PRESSURE IS ON ENGLAND THEY ARE THE FAVOURITES I SUPPOSE IT WITH MOST OF US HAVE PICKED ARE MIXED
SQUADS IF YOU LIKE OR MIXED TEAMS BETWEEN THE TWO AND THIS PROBABLY ONLY REALISTICALLY TO THREE OR FOUR WELSH PLAYERS WE'VE GOT IT WHILE YOU'VE GOT IT I WONDERED WHEN YOU'D BRING THAT UP TOOK ALI I THINK I'LL GO FOR TWO OR THREE OR FOUR MAYBE TRYING TO BE NICE TO YOU BUT YOU KNOW YOU EXPECTING ENGLAND
PLAY IF A PLAYER SHOULD WIN THE GAME AND THIS IS WHERE THE WELSH IF WE WIN THE GAME IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE GOT MORE PRIDE IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE GOT MORE PASSION BUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ENGLAND DRAW IN THAT FIRST GAME PUTS THEM ON THE BACK FOOT AND THEY'VE GOT TO GO OUT I THINK IT'S MAYBE JOHNNY'S WAY TO WALK TOWARDS
WALES MIGHT MAKE UP OR CHANGES AFTER WINNING THE GAME ENGLAND HAVE DRAWN AND THEY MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES SO IT'S A TRICKY ONE TO CALL I THINK TODAY WELL I'M GOING TO ASK DANNY DO YOU THINK THEY'LL EVEN BE A CHANGE TO THE ENGLAND FORMATION AT ALL I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE
POSSIBLE CHANGE MAYBE STERLING AND PLAYED WELL WITHOUT PUTTING THE BALL IN THE BACK OF THE NET THEY CRAVE GOT TO CHANCES THEY DIDN'T QUITE HAVE THE THE FINAL BALL OF THE FINISHING TOUCH IN FRONT OF GOAL WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISE MAYBE STERLING IS POSSIBLY
THE ONLY CHANGE BUT AGAIN ENGLAND THERE'S THERE'S A DEARTH OF HIGH WIDE ATTACKING PLAYS IN THE ENGLAND SQUAD AND THERE'S NO NATURAL REPLACEMENT FOR RAHEEM STERLING AND LEFT ROY CHANGES THE FORMATION BUT I DON'T THINK HE'LL DO THAT JOHN IF YOU WERE ROY HODGSON WOULD YOU BE INSTRUCTING SOMEONE TO MAN MARK GARETH BALE
WELL I CAN'T GIVE ALL THE SECRETS AWAY YOU'RE HONEST BUT WHAT YOU DON'T WANT GARETH DOOHAN IS HE'S BEEN ABLE TO TUNE IN POSSESSION OF THE BALL AND ATTACK IN THE SPACE
BECAUSE HE IS SO EXPLOSIVE RAPID QUICK HE'S THE TYPE OF PLAYER THAT DRAWS A PLAYER KNOCKS YOU PAST HIM WHEN HE'S IN FULL FLOW WHEN HE'S IN FULL STRIDE YOU CANNOT GET BACK AT HIM HE CAN BE UNPLAYABLE WHEN HE'S ON HIS DAY WILL DO IT FOR REAL MADRID WE SAW HIM DO IT FOR SPORS BEFORE HE LEFT FOR THE WORLD RECORD FEE BUT GOING BACK SLIGHTLY IF I CAN TO WHAT YOU SAID TO DANNY ABOUT CHANGES
VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU GET HER I THINK ROY HODGSON TODAY WOULD BE MAKING A MISTAKE IF HE DIDN'T LEAVE A HARDY I THINK WALES WOULD BE DELIGHTED DEFENSIVELY IS JIMMY WABI DIDN'T PLAY BECAUSE HE'S A LIVEWIRE I KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE'LL SLIP IN DEEP AND IZZLES BASING BEHIND BUT HE'S A LIVEWIRE WHY BRING A TWENTY FIVE GORE PREMIER LEAGUE STRIKER WHO'S ON HER LOTS OF FOOTBALL CLUBS LIPS THIS SEASON OF TUBES OF A TRANSFER FEE DID BRILLIANT FOR LEICESTER WIN IN THE LEAGUE WHY BRILLIANT I'M NOT USING
I THINK A LOT OF ENGLAND FANS BUT ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT END WITH A COUPLE OF SCORE PREDICTIONS FROM YOU THEN DANNY FIRST ALWAYS SAINT GEORGE ALWAYS SLAYS THE DRAGON IT'S ANYTHING LESS TODAY ENGLAND TO WALES ONE YOU DON'T COMEDIAN TELL UNLESS I WILL DRAW SIMPLY BECAUSE WHALES DON'T NEED TO WIN THE GAME ENGLAND NEED TO WIN OR DRAW SUIT WHEELS FINE

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FORWARD SARAH MONTAGUE AND NICK ROBINSON THE TIME IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE CORI CAUGHT FOR IT HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS DAVID CAMERON HAS ATTACKED BOAT LEAVE FOR UNDERMINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND HE WAS RESPONDING TO A LATER ISSUE BY TWO FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLORS AND TWO EX PARTY LEADERS WHICH ACCUSED THE BANK AND THE TREASURY ARE PEDDLING PHONEY FORECAST TO FRIGHTEN THE ELECTORATE INTO VOTING TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY HAS SENT AN ANGRY RESPONSE TO A SENIOR FIGURE IN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WHO HAD WARNED HIM NOT TO BREAK THE SO CALLED PURDAH RULES BANNING COMMENT ON THE REFERENDUM BY OFFICIALS ARE PUBLIC HAVE FUNDED BODIES MISTER CARNEY ACCUSED THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. BERNARD JENKIN OF THREATENING HIM AND INSISTED HIS COMMENTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH HIS REMIT
SIXTEEN PEOPLE WERE TREATED IN HOSPITAL FOLLOWING CLASHES LAST NIGHT BETWEEN ENGLAND FOOTBALL VANSEN FRENCH POLICE IN THE HILL THIRTY SIX PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED ENGLAND PLAY WALES THIS AFTERNOON DIVERS HAVE FOUND THE BODY OF A TWO YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS KILLED BY AN ALLIGATOR AT WALT DISNEY WORLD IN FLORIDA THE CHART WAS DRAGGED INTO THE WATER WHILE PLAYING ON THE SHORE OF THE LAGOON
IT'S NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE NOTHIN AINS A GHORAIDH RATCLIFFE HAS BEEN IN PRISON IN IRAN SINCE THE START OF APRIL HER BRITISH PASSPORT WAS TAKEN OFF HER AND SHE WAS ARRESTED WHEN SHE TRIED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH HER NOW TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND FAMILY AT HOPE SHE WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED BUT NOW A STATEMENT FROM THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS HAS ACCUSED HER
OF PLOTTING TO OVERTHROW IRAN'S GOVERNMENT IT CLAIM SHE HEADS A FOREIGN LINKED HOSTILE NETWORK HER HUSBAND RICHARD RATCLIFFE WHO'S AN ACCOUNTANT IN HAMPSHIRE IS HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU DID MORNING SIR WHEN DID YOU HEAR OF THIS LATEST NEWS SO I I READ ABOUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE SAME THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE AND CHECK WITH HER FAMILY AND THEY'D ALSO READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SO YESTERDAY WE WE SAW THESE CHARGES
ACCUSATIONS I DON'T THINK LEGALLY ANY CHARGES HAVE BEEN LAID THAT SAID THAT NINA'S IN CHARGE OF US GOT A GREAT NETWORK OF MEDIA ORGANISATIONS AND ESPIONAGE AGENCIES AND THE SEEING GABRIELLA AND THERE ARE RUNNING THE WHOLE THING NOW I KNOW YOU THAT YOU HAD HOPED THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO BE RELEASED AND THEN YOU STOPPED HEARING FROM
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO THIS IS WHERE THE WHOLE SITUATION SO I'M CLEARED IT TEN DAYS AGO LAST SUNDAY SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE RELEASED WITHOUT CHARGE AND SHE TELEPHONED HER FAMILY TO SAY THAT THAT IT WAS ALL OVER AND SHE WAS GONNA RELEASED HIM SHE CLEARLY PACKED UP HER THINGS OUT OF PRISON AND LEFT BECAUSE HER CELL MAIDSTONE TELEPHONED HER PARENTS' HOUSE TO TO SEE HOW SHE WAS NOW SHE WAS GOING ON
THERE WAS A FEW HOURS LATER A PHONE CALL TO A PARENT'S RECEIVED FROM THE VERY SHALL WE GOT TO SAY THAT WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT WAS A CHANGE SHE WAS CAN BE TRANSFERRED AND THEN WE HEARD NOTHING FROM HER FUR FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS SO WHEN WE LAST WEEK WE CELEBRATED TO GABRIELLA'S BIRTHDAY WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE SHE WAS
AND ON MONDAY SHE TELEPHONED HER PARENTS TO SAY SHE WAS IN EVIN PRISON IN TEHRAN AND WHICH IS NOT A GREAT PLACE BUT AT LEAST IT'S IN TEHRAN SO THERE'S A CHANCE FOR A FAMILY VISIT AND IN FACT HER MOTHER AND CAPITAL WERE ABLE TO SEE HER THIS WEEK I'M GABRIELLE AS YOUR DAUGHTER
AND SHE HAD BEEN HELD IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT DO YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS HOW SHE IS IN HERSELF I DONE SO THAT'S RIGHT SHE WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS DOWN IN INCOME WHICH IS A THOUSAND KILOMETRES AWAY AND I SPOKE TO HER VIA AN INDIRECT ROUTES WHEN SHE CAME OUT
AND SHE'D OBVIOUSLY MADE VERY WEAK WHEN SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE WHEN SHE CAME OUT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT BLACKOUTS AND SHE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HER HAIR FALLING OUT AND SHE'D LOST QUITE A WEIGHT SHE WAS GETTING STRONGER WHILE SHE WAS IN THE GENERAL SALES IN COMMAND BUT I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER SINCE THAT POINT
WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE CHARGES ARE COMING FROM I KNOW YOUR WIFE WORKS FOR THE CHARITABLE ARM OF THOMPSON REUTERS FOUNDATION BUT TO BE ACCUSED OF PLOTTING THE OVERTHROW OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS VERY SERIOUS
IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR IS THAT THE CHARGES COME FROM THE CAMEL BRANCH OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD WHO HAD BEEN THE ONES HOLDING THERE SO IN PART IT'S THEM JUSTIFYING THAT THEY HELD AT THE SEVENTY DAYS AND THERE'S AN IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION THERE DOING IT WHAT THE CHARGE THAT I WOULDN'T BE ANY ACCUSATION ACTUALLY SAY IT'S JUST THAT THAT SHE'S A MEMBER OF THIS ORGANISATION SO IT DOESN'T GO INTO ANY DETAIL
BUT IT HADN'T AND IT SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT WORKING FOR THOMPSON AS FOUNDATION IS THE SAME THING AS BEING HEAD OF THE NETWORK IT IT I MEAN
SHE WORKS AN ORGANISATION THAT DOESN'T WORKING AROUND WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON YOU'VE GONE BACK YOU'VE GONE THERE ON HOLIDAY YEAH I'VE I'VE BEEN FULL TIME SO THE PREVIOUS TIME WE WENT WHICH WAS FOR HER SISTER'S WEDDING IN MAY LAST ME FINE NO PROBLEMS AND SHE HAD BEEN FULL TIME SINCE KEVIN WAS BORN AND I DON'T YOU SEEM VERY CALM ARE YOU HOPEFUL
THAT THIS IS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING THAT WILL BE QUICKLY CLEARED UP I THINK WILL BE INTERVENTION AT THE SENIOR I'M HOPEFUL THAT SENIOR INTERVENTION CAN CHANGE AND IN SOME WAYS NOW SHE'S IN TEHRAN AND IF NOTHING ELSE YOUR OWN AUTHORITIES CAN LOOK MORE SERIOUSLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND LOOK AT THE SORT OF CRAZY THEORIES COMING OUT FROM THE PROVINCIAL OFFICE HE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THIS GETS MORE SERIOUS THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS IS FOR AFTERS DOING SOMETHING AND
WE PETITION TERRY CAMERON TO DO WHAT HE CAN AND IT FEELS THIS IS WRAPPED UP AND IN IRANIAN POLITICS AND DIFFERENT FACTIONS FIGHTING AND HOLDING HER AS SOME SORT OF BARGAINING CHIP IN THAT SENSE I'M NOT NOT HOPEFUL BUT I'M ALSO NOT CLEAR WHAT THIS MEANS AT ALL
RICHARD RADCLIFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY TO NINE IS THE BANK OF ENGLAND PEDDLING PHONEY FORECAST IS IT ALLOWING HE'S THE GOVERNOR ALLOWING HIS PRIVATE PERSONAL VIEWS TO BECOME THE PUBLIC VIEWS OF AN IMPORTANT INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF NOT JUST ONE BUT TWO ROWS WE'VE GOT A GROUP OF SENIOR CONSERVATIVES TODAY INCLUDING TWO FORMER CHANCELLOR

BERNARD JENKIN WHO'S BEEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF IT WILL HERE FOR MY DRINKING IN CHESTER SECOND FIRST OH COME ON MARK COME ON HE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS IS HE WHAT'S HE BEEN SAYING HE'S NOT AT ALL SO BERNARD JENKIN WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE AND ALSO DIRECTOR OF VOTE LEAVE

FROM MISTER CARNEY MY CONNIE SAID THE MISTER JENKINS LETTER WAS FULL OF NUMEROUS AND SUBSTANTIAL MISS CONTRACEPTION THAT HE HASN'T MADE HIS OWN PERSONAL VIEWS KNOWN HE'S JUST GIVING WITHIN THE REMIT OF THE OF THE BANK THE VIEWS OF THE BANK AND THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC
IMPACT OF BRECHT'S IT BUT IT HAS SHOWN AT THE REAL TENSION BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN DON'T GET OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR LAST MONTH THAT THEY COULD BE A TECHNICAL RECESSION SIX MONTHS OF NEGATIVE GROWTH
IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN REALLY BRIEFLY BECAUSE HE THINKS IT'S HIS DUTY TO GIVE US THAT FORECAST AND THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM AN OPINION ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO HE SAYS THAT IT WOULD BE NON TRANSPARENT AND THAT IT WOULD BE POLITICAL TO WITHHOLD THE INFORMATION THE BANK HAS ON THE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC EFFECTS
OF BRECHT'S WHY BERNARD JENKIN WHO JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU BY THE WAY WHY MY DRINK I'M AFRAID WE'RE RATHER SHORT OF TIME BUT WHY IS THAT NOT PRECISELY HIS DUTY TELL US WHAT THE FORECASTS ARE THE WORK OF THE BANK ANY AFTER ALL IT ISN'T JUST HIS WORK IT'S THE WORK OF A TEAM OF ECONOMISTS AND THE ENTIRE GOVERNING BODY OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND
EXCEPT HIS REASSURANCE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSED HIS BRONZE I LEAVE THAT ASIDE THE POINT IS IN THE TWENTY EIGHT DAY PERIOD WE HAD THIS ARRANGEMENT RESTRICTION THAT BODY UNDERGOES A PUBLIC ARE INTO A RUN ON PUBLIC TONS ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING THE DEBATE AND THAT WAS THE POINT I WAS MAKING MY LAST
AND YOUR SECOND POINT IF YOU WOULD BRIEFLY AND THE SECOND POINT IF YOU CONSULTED THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION ABOUT
NO DRINKING VERY CAREFUL WHAT HE SAYS I'M SORRY TO MAKE IT SO BRIEF BUT WE JUST GOT NEWS THAT LETTER WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO COME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IT'S NOW QUARTER TO NINE SCIENTISTS CAN CREATE SYNTHETIC D.N.A. THEY'VE ALREADY CONSTRUCTED THE WHOLE GENOME OF SOME SIMPLE SINGLE CELLED ORGANISMS LIKE VIRUS AND BACTERIA NOW THEY WANT TO GO FURTHER A GROUP OF LEADING SCIENTISTS HAS LAUNCHED
GENOME PROJECT RIGHT WITH THE AIM OF CREATING THAN ENTIRE GENETIC MAKE UP OF A HUMAN NOT SURPRISINGLY SOME ARE WORRIED BY THAT IDEA WHAT PROFESSOR GEORGE CHURCHES FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL HE'S A PIONEER IN THIS SYNTHETIC TECHNOLOGY NEEDS HERE IN THE U.K. TO SPEAK AT THE FOUNDERS FORM CONVENTION FOR TECH ENTREPRENEURS AND JOINS US AND OUR RADIO CAR NOW GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR CHURCH
GOOD MORNING HOW ARE YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IT IS THAT YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS RESEARCH
WE'VE RECENTLY BROUGHT DOWN THE COST OF READING THE GENOMES BY OVER A MILLION FOR THAT WELL ON OUR WAY TO DOING THE SAME THING FOR RIDING THOSE GENOMES AND WE'RE THERE TO USE IT TO MAKE ER VIRUS RESISTANT
CELLS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE MEANING OF THE DIVERSITY OF THE D.N.A. WAS IN OUR POPULATION
SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN YOU AS I MENTION IN THE INTRODUCTION SCIENTISTS YOU HAVE ALREADY CREATED I THINK YEAST HAVEN'T YOU YOU'VE CREATED A YEAST CELL OR SYNTHETIC CELL
RIGHT POP POP PARTIALLY ER FINISH THAT USED THAT BUT ARE YOU CONFIDENT IT'S CHANGING THEM FROM WHAT NATURE OH CAKE ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR A HUMAN CELL
WELL WE ALREADY ER EDIT HUMAN CELLS AND PART OF THE REVOLUTION THAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY WAS A METHOD CALLED CRISPER WHICH ALLOWS US TO EDIT THOSE CELLS AND REALLY COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF THE GENOME
IF THE PRICE CAN BE BROUGHT DOWN TO A COMPARABLE POINT WOULD BE PART OF A CONTINUUM OF REVOLUTION AND BUT THAT PRICE I MEAN AT THE MOMENT YOU'RE LAUNCHING THIS PROJECT IS THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT CAN BE AND WE'RE TALKING IN A FEW YEARS BEING ABLE TO CREATE A HUMAN CELL
RIGHT WE CAN ALREADY AT HUMAN CELLS THIS WOULD BE THIS WILL GET ON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MY WRITING IT LITERALLY FROM SCRATCH CREATING THIS THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S
YES IT IS TECHNICALLY IT MIGHT BE BY ETA DOING A LARGE PIECES OF IT AT THE TIME BUT THE THE CAPABILITY THEY WERE HEADING FOR IS VERY LOW COST SYNTHESIS OF LARGE PIECES FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF ORGANISMS FOR AGRICULTURAL MEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENT SIGNIFICANCE UNDER ARE WE TALKING ABOUT JUST A SINGLE CELL
POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO HAVE MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTS TO TEST THE MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN A CLINICAL SETTING FOR HUMANS OR THERE ARE NEEDED TO BE TESTED AND PROTESTING AS A BIG PART OF THIS FOR AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENT OR
REASONS O.K. LET ME ASK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NOT LEAST THEIR DOCTOR FRANCIS COLLINS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH WHO IS THE MAIN FUNDER OF MEDICAL RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES AND HE RACES THIS QUESTION OF THE NUMEROUS ETHICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL RED FLAGS WOULD IT BE O.K. FOR EXAMPLE TO SEQUENCE AND THEN SYNTHESISE LET'S TAKE UNSTICK EINSTEIN'S GENOME
RIGHT SO I MEAN THERE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT BY A GROUP AS WELL AS OTHERS ABOUT JOHN LINE EDITING EVEN OF A SINGLE BASED PAIR IN IN HUMAN BEINGS MAKING CELL LINES THERE A VIRUS RESISTANT OR FOR THAT MATTER REPRESENT THE VARIATION THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN
PEOPLE LIKE EINSTEIN IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CATEGORY THE CELLS GROW AND TISSUE CULTURE AND THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THEM THEY ARE INCREASINGLY USED IN THERAPY IS SO YOU HAVE STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION THERAPIES THERE COULD BE MUCH MUCH SAFER OR BY THIS METHOD
BUT I THINK CROSSING A LINE HAVE YOU GOT A SINGLE BASED PEER INTO THE DRUM MINUS WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEBATED PROFESSOR GEORGE CHURCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE YESTERDAY MORNING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE CHANCELLOR COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CLEARER THERE'LL BE NO FURTHER MOVES TO CHANGE THE Y. USE FREEDOM OR MOVEMENT RULES CERTAINLY
NO MOOSE BEFORE THIS REFERENDUM IT LAST NIGHT THE HOME SECRETARY TOLD THE B. B. C. THE FURTHER REFORM WAS NEEDED AND THIS FOLLOWED A CALL FROM LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON FOR A ROOT AND BRANCH REVIEW OF THE E. USE RULES ON MIGRATION SOMETHING HIS OWN LEADER JEREMY CORBIN HAS SHOWN VERY LITTLE INTEREST IN WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON WE'RE JOINED BY ASIA HAS A RICA FORMER ADVISER TO HARRIET HARMAN AND ED MILIBAND AND STEVE RICHARDS COLUMNIST WITH THE INDEPENDENT MORNING TO BOTH OF YOU
FIRST OF ALL STEVE THIS REPRESENTS A SORT OF AGONISING DOESN'T IT BY PEOPLE IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN THE E.U. DO WE SAY SOMETHING ON IT IMMIGRATION BEFORE THIS VOTE OR IF WE DO DO WE HAVE BARELY POT OR WEAKEST ISSUE UP IN LIGHTS IT'S SOMETIMES OF POLITICS AND ISSUE ARISES THAT PRESENT SO MANY DILEMMAS COMMENTATORS FROM THE OUTSIDE CAN SCREEN WISE AND EX SAYING MORE WISE WHY SHOWING STRONGER LEADERSHIP
BUT THERE IS NO CLEAR ANSWER IN A BINARY REFERENDUM I THINK THAT'S THE NIGHTMARE FOR THOSE ARE SPECIALLY ON THE REMAIN SIDE FOR EXAMPLE THAT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY WANTS TO COMPLEX AS YOU MENTIONED JEREMY CORBIN IS IN FAVOUR OF FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR EVEN THOUGH HE'S SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION SO MUCH SEVEN OUT OF TEN IN HIS SUPPORT FOR FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR HE'S IN ALLIANCE WITH TONY BLAIR THAT MUST BE THE ONLY ISSUE
AND B. WHILE YOU HAVE OTHERS LIKE YVETTE COOPER THE FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AS YOU SAY TOM WATSON ARGUING THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF INTERVENTION AND THAT APPEARS TO BE WHERE LABOUR VOTERS
SO IT IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX ISSUES THAT YOU CAN'T SOLVE A WEEK AHEAD OF BINARY REFERENDUM AND ASIA IS FAR FROM NEW IS IT THIS DEBATE WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN A RECALL ED BALLS BACK RUNNING FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LABOUR PARTY I THINK IN TWENTY TEN ARGUING THAT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HAD TO GO
IT'S BEEN A REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR THE LABOUR PARTY FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME AND BECAUSE AS STEVE SAID THERE ARE NO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS THERE VERY VERY COMPLEX I THINK PEOPLE THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE SORT OF SHIED AWAY FROM TALKING ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK
KNEW TOM IS SAYING THAT HE'S GOT THE ANSWERS ARE IN WHAT TOM WATSON OR YVETTE COOPER BUT I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SORT OF SAYING IS THAT THE TRYING TO GET A MESSAGE OUT TO THE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO LABOUR VOTERS FOR AFTER THE REFERENDUM WHATEVER HAPPENS WHICH IS I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S THERE THAT BASIC BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS FOR LABOUR WHATEVER WHETHER WE BREAK SO WHETHER WE STAY
IMMIGRATION IS HERE IT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR THE LABOUR PARTY THE DANGER OF NOT DOING IT STEVE IS THAT YOU SOUND LIKE GORDON BROWN HE CLASHED WITH JOHN ON THE PROGRAMME THE OTHER DAY WHEN HE WAS REMINDED OF THAT AWKWARD MOMENT WITH MISSUS DUFFY AND HE'S THEN ACCUSED OF AS IT WERE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS NOT HEARING WHAT THE PUBLIC ARE SAYING THAT'S PART OF THE DILEMMA I MEAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK WE ALL HEARD THAT THE WEEK WILL BE CLEARED FOR LABOUR POLITICIANS TO COME IN AND RECONNECT WITH THE LABOUR VOTE TO TRY AND PERSUADE THEM TO GET THE REMAINING
CAMPAIGN UP AND RUNNING IN REGARD TO THAT LABOUR VOTE AND OF COURSE IMMIGRATION THEN BECAME THE THEME YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW ANY LABOUR POLISH COMES ON YOU WILL ASK NICK ABOUT IMMIGRATION SO THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE A LINE NOW THIS IS WHERE THE DILEMMA IS ACUTE WHERE I THINK ATTACKS ON PEOPLE LIKE BALLS AND YVETTE COOPER WHAT UNFAIR IS IN SOME SOME IN THERE REMAIN COUPLE FURIOUS WITH THEM AS IF THIS WAS A NEW INITIATIVE AS YOU SAY THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING THIS FOR AGES I REMEMBER YVETTE COOPER AT LAST
PRE CONFERENCE PRE ELECTION CONFERENCE SPEECH AS SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ARGUING THE LEFT CENTRE BELIEVES AN INTERVENING IN OTHER MARKETS WHAT ABOUT THE LABOUR MARKET TOO SO IT'S NOT AS IF ICES ARE SUDDENLY KNEW SPLIT BUT I THINK WHAT'S DIFFICULT IS THAT TO THE LABOUR PARTY HAS SORT OF IT'S BEING ABLE TO SORT OF
JUST BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STRUCTURE ECONOMIC THINGS WHAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME IS THE CULTURAL FEELING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE LABOUR AND THE PARTY SO SPLIT LAST NIGHT TALKING TO A LOT OF EM PEAS SOME OF WHOM ARE REALLY ANGRY WITH TOM BUT OTHERS JUST SAYING LOOK
WE HAVE GOT TO SHOW THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO ACTUALLY JUST LISTEN TO THEM IT'S THAT THEY SAY SOME OF THAT IS FOR THE FUTURE BRIEFLY IF YOU BOTH WHAT DO YOU HAVE YOUR EARS TO THE GROUND YOU'RE TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THEIR EARS TO THE GROUND HOW WORRIED ARE LABOUR FOLK THAT THEIR PEOPLE WILL NOT VOTE FOR REMAIN IN THEIR NUMBERS EXPECTED AND THAT MIGHT MEAN THAT BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U. I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY VERY WORRIED THIS IS A VERY REAL THREAT
I THINK LABOUR M.P.S WHO WERE VERY PRO EUROPE VERY PRO LABOUR SOLUTION TIPPED ALL THESE PROBLEMS ARE VERY VERY WORRIED STEVE RETCHES YEAH I'VE BEEN INTERVIEWING A TON OF LABOUR M.P.S FOR SERIES GOING OUT NOT ABOUT THE Y. YOU AFTER THE REFERENDUM AND OFFICEY I ASKED EACH OF THEM BEFORE DOING THE INTERVIEW WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY SAID THEY HAD LOST THEIR LABOUR VOTE IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY THAT WAS PASSIONATE
PRO EUROPEANS AND CORBIN EASTERS AND SO CLEARLY THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT STEVE RICHARDS HI SHE HAS A REKHA
THANK YOU BOTH IT'S SIX MINUTES TO NINE MORE THAN HALF OF PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS SAY THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SHARE AND TALK ABOUT BOOKS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT'S ACCORDING TO A SURVEY BY THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS AND ALMOST ALL THE TEACHERS THEY SPOKE TO AGREE THAT IF CHILDREN READ CLASSIC STORIES IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO LOVE READING MORE WHEN IT'S PROMPTED THE O.U. PETER REPOLISH SOME CLASSICS THE LIKES OF MOBY DICK HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN AN AESOP'S FABLES
BUT THEY'VE BEEN REWORKED REWRITTEN BY SOME OF OUR MOST FAMOUS CURRENT CHILDREN'S AUTHORS AMONG THEM THE WRITER OF WAR HORSE THE FORMER CHILDREN'S LAUREATE MICHAEL MORE PER GO WHO JOINS US NOW AS DOES JANE HARLEY WHOSE STRATEGY DIRECTOR FOR U.K. EDUCATION AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING JANE HOLLY ONE HAS TO ASK FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A REASON THESE ARE CLASSICS WHICH IS THAT THEY ARE CRACKINGLY GOOD READS WHY REWRITE
I THINK THAT WHAT WE KNOW IS AT THE AGES OF SEVEN TO ELEVEN CHILDREN HAVE LEARNT TO READ BUT ACTUALLY THEY NEED REAL ENCOURAGEMENT TO ENGAGE IN READING AND ACTUALLY KEEP READING AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS TO TAKE THE CLASSICS WHICH WE HAVE
MOST EXCITING PLOTS THE MOST FANTASTIC STORIES THAT THEY WILL REALLY ENCOURAGE CHILDREN BUT RECAST THEM IN A WAY THAT ABSOLUTELY HOOKS CHILDREN IN SO THEY'RE RE TOLD BY BRILLIANT STORY TELLERS SERIES EDITED BY MICHAEL MOORE POCO AND
THEY ARE GIVING TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CHILDREN ACCESS TO CLASSIC STORIES BUT IN A WAY THEY CAN REALLY REALLY TAP INTO NOW MICHAEL MOORE GET YOU TOOK ON THE JOB OF PETER AND THE WOLF HOW DO YOU APPROACH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE ALL DO FROM MY PROKOFIEV AND EXACTLY THOSE WORDS BUT I WANTED TO GIVE IT NEW LIFE DIFFERENT LIFE BECAUSE I'M SEVENTY TWO THAT'S HOW I LEARNT IT
THIS IS A FRESH WHERE TELLING IT SO I'VE TOLD IT THROUGH THE GRANDFATHER'S EYES RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHICH HAVE BEEN FUN OH CABLE COULD YOU READ US AN EXTRACT FROM IT SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE STORY
SOMETHING WAS MOVING AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST A WOLF A GREAT GREY WOLF STARING STRAIGHT AT ME HIS EYES YELLOW HIS TONGUE READ HIS TEETH SHARP I RAN FOR IT STUMBLING THROUGH THE SNOW I CAN FEEL HIM COMING AFTER ME CLOSER CLOSER I CAN HEAR THE DUCKS QUACKING ANGRILY FROM THE POND I REACHED THE GATE BOLTED IT FAST BEHIND ME AND LOOKED OUT
IT WAS THE DUCK THAT SAVE ME THE WOLF WAS PROWLING ROUND THE POND HIS EYES ON THE DUCK THIS WOLF PREFER DOCTOR BOY THANK GOODNESS
I MEAN THAT JANE HARLEY I SUPPOSE THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IS NOT JUST RE WRITING IN IN PERHAPS A DIFFERENT WAY A NEW VERSION BUT YOU HAVE SUCH AN AUTHOR LIKE MICHAEL MOORE PAGO WHO CHILDREN RECOGNISE AND PERHAPS FEEL SAFER WITH
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I THINK TEACHERS ALSO ABSOLUTELY NO PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL PER GO PHILIP READ SOME OF THESE GREAT CHILDREN'S WRITERS TODAY AND SO ACTUALLY
HAVING ACCESS TO BRILLIANT WRITERS FROM TODAY BUT ALSO GIVING THEM A WINDOW ON THE WORLD OF GREAT WRITERS OF THE PAST IS JUST A FANTASTIC COMBINATION AND I THINK IF YOU ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT HE'S MUCH ABOUT MAKING TEACHERS THINK AGAIN ABOUT CLASSICS AS THE CHILDREN I THINK WELL I THINK FROM OUR RESEARCH WHAT WE KNOW IS TEACHERS ABSOLUTELY THEMSELVES LOVED THE CLASSICS MANY OF THEM SAID THAT THEY ARE A GREAT WAY OF INSPIRING CHILDREN BUT I THINK THIS IS GIVING THEM A FRESH WAY IN AND WHAT WE DO AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS IS REALLY TRY AND SUPPORT BUSY TEACHERS
AND PARENTS ACTUALLY BY GIVING THEM REALLY MOTIVATING THINGS THAT WILL IN HER ENGAGE CHILDREN AND ALSO SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS TO HELP THEM TALK ABOUT THESE BOOKS BECAUSE IT'S THEIR STORIES AND TALKING THAT REALLY MATTERS MICHAEL MOORE PURGATORY NOT HOLLY MAKES POINT YOUR SERIES EDITOR AND YOU HAVE THE LIKES OF GILLIAN CROSS FIND REALLY WORKING WORKINGS
WHIT DOES IT OTHER SURPRISES IN IT I MEAN YOU TELLING PETER AND WILL FROM THE GRANDFATHER'S POINT OF YOUR OTHER SURPRISES WITH WHAT THE OTHER AUTHORS HAVE DONE IT'S NOT COSHED AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT WHAT SURPRISED ME FOR INSTANCE YESTERDAY I WAS JUST READING JULIAN CROSSES OF IT
WELL HOW WONDERFUL THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO READ OF IT UNLESS MAYBE SEE IT AS A PLAY OR UNLESS IT'S RE TOLD IN LANGUAGE THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN GET AND GILLIAN CROSS IS AN EXPERT AT THAT ANYTHING JODY MUCK COCKER RIGHTS IN TERMS OF RETELLING BRINGS NEW LIFE SHINES NEW LIGHT ON
ON THESE STORIES AND THE THING LIGHTS UP FOR THEM AND ALSO LIGHTS UP FOR TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN I WAS GOING TO SAY FOR ADULTS I MEAN UM YOU HEAR THAT AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO READ THAT IT POSSIBLY A WHOLE NEW AUDIENCE THIS SURVEY THAT YOU DID THERE AT THE O.U. P. PERHAPS IT'S NOT SURPRISING TEACHERS IT WOULD BE ASTONISHING WOULDN'T IT IF THEY DIDN'T SAY I WANT MORE TIME TO READ OR TO READ STORIES TO DO IN SUMMERS WHAT'S ALMOST THE FUND
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK TEACHERS ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE TIME TO READ AND THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT IN ANY SENSE A CRITICISM OF TEACHERS I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE AS AN EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY GIVE BACK TIME TO TEACH US TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND PASSING ON THAT PASSION FOR READING
OFFERS SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN'S FUTURE LIFE TRANSCEND AND THE FANFARE YOU KNOW AND I'VE FUN THE GREAT THING IS THAT READING IS HAS TO BE FUN AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THIRTY FIVE STORIES MENTIONED HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN AESOP'S FABLES MOBY DICK WHAT OTHERS ARE IN THEY WILL I MEAN YOU'VE GOT EMMA SITTING NEXT NEXT DAUGHTER OF THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IN I THINK THAT'S WHAT AT THE AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE INTRODUCED THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MANY THESE KIDS WHATEVER
OF COME ACROSS JANE AUSTEN AGAIN WHAT DOES IT MATTER THAT THEY THINK OH WHAT NOW READ JANE AUSTEN I WON'T GO TO THE ORIGINAL NUMBER THEY WON'T DO THAT COS I KNOW THAT MYSELF AND SO DO YOU WHEN YOU READ WHEN YOU WERE TOLD A STORY WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU'RE RED EYE READING SOMETHING OR CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED WHICH HAVE MOSTLY PICTURES THAT I CAME ACROSS OLIVER TWIST IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE CHRISTMAS CAROL TEN YEARS LATER I WANT TO READ THE WHOLE THING BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT WHEN YOU ARE LITTLE PERSON
