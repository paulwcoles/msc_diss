THE PING
I THOUGHT I HAD THE BABY THAT I HAVE BEEN NURSING TAKEN CARE

AND THEN ANOTHER THOUGHT WHICH CAME WITH THAT
WHERE'S MY BABY YOU CAN HEAR MUCH MORE A MATTHEW PRICE HIS INTERVIEW AT TEN PAST EIGHT AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO OLD SALVADOR WHO WAS CRUCIAL IN THE LEGAL BATTLE TO GETTING THEM REUNITED AS A FAMILY IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX
THE N.H.S. DEPENDS ON DOCTORS AND NURSES MANY OF WHOM ARE NON WHITE A REPORT OUT TODAY SAYS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF BULLYING AND HARASSMENT THAN THEIR WHITE COLLEAGUES WHICH HAS CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR THEM BUT FOR PATIENTS TO WE'RE JOINED NOW BY A SOCIAL AFFAIR IT'S CORRESPOND ELAINE DUNKLEY MORNINGS YOU ALONE WHAT IS THIS REPORT TELL US
THIS REPORT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PAGES OF TABLES GRAPHS AND DATEABLE BEHIND ALL OF RACE IS A WORRYING PICTURE OF THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK AND MINORITY ETHNIC STUFF WITHIN THE N.H.S. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS REPORT LOOKS AT FOUR INDICATORS ACROSS OUR HOSPITALS AMBULANCE SERVICES COMMUNITY CARE PROVIDERS OR MENTAL HEALTH AND LEARNING DISABILITY TRUSTS SO A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES AND IT FOUND OVER THREE QUARTERS OF ALL HOSPITAL TRUST SHOW MORE BLACK MINORITY ETHNIC STUFF
COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COLLEAGUES CLAIM THEY'VE BEEN HARASSED BULLIED OR ABUSED BY THEIR TEAM LEADERS AND MANAGERS THE REPORT ALSO SAYS BLACK MINORITY ETHNIC OR BEAR ME STUFF PHIL LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM SENIOR POSITIONS IN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF TRUSTS MAUBEE ANY STUFF MIGHT EMPLOYEE SAID THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ORGANISATION OFFERED EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER PROGRESSION
OR PROMOTION DISTRESSING FOR THEM OF COURSE A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM FOR THE N.H.S. BUT IS THE REPORT ARGUING THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE USERS OF THE N.H.S. FOR THE PATIENTS WELL THIS ALL HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON
THE MORALE OF STUFF AND THAT IN TURN THEN HAS AN IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE AND PATIENT SAFETY AND WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE FIGURES ONLY FIVE TRUST OUT OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE REPORTED NO GAP BETWEEN THE ENEMY AND WHITE COLLEAGUES EXPERIENCES ON THESE ISSUES SO IT TOOK A WIDE ISSUE ACROSS THE N.H.S. AND THE FASCINATING THING IS THAT THIS SURVEY DOES NOT SAY THERE'S MORE BULLYING BY THE PATIENTS TO THE STAFF ABOUT THEIR STAFF TO EACH OTHER YES THIS IS ABOUT HOW
BLACK ASIAN MINORITY ETHNIC STUFF FEEL ABOUT THEIR COLLEAGUES THEIR TEAM LEADERS THE MANAGES THE PEOPLE THEY'RE MEANT TO BE GOING TO IN ORDER TO RESOLVE ISSUES AND THEY'RE FINDING THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE HAVING THE MOST PROBLEMS
YOU KNOW WHILST WHILST THERE'S BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT WITHIN CERTAIN TRUSS THIS REPORT SUGGESTS A LOT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF ANY STUFF BEING TREATED LESS FAVOURABLY IN RECRUITMENT CAREER DEVELOPMENT OR THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS BULLYING VICTIMISATION
HELLO DOUGIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT WE'LL BE TALKING TO A MIDWIFE LATER ON AND ALSO SOMEONE WHO'S INVOLVED IN TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR POLICIES AROUND THE TREATMENT STAR THANK YOU THANK YOU HERE IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX AND IT'S BEEN AN ANXIOUS REALLY DIFFICULT COUPLE OF MONTHS FOR STAFF AT B.H.S. AFTER THE COMPANY COLLAPSED AND WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION BUT ROB WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME IDEA IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS PERHAPS BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YES THAT'S RIGHT A DECISION ON THE FUTURE OF THE BELEAGUERED HIGH STREET RETAILER IS EXPECTED TO BE MADE LATER TODAY WE KNOW THAT IT COLLAPSED INTO ADMINISTRATION AND APRIL JUST A YEAR AFTER IT WAS SOLD BY THE TYCOON SIR PHILIP GREEN FOR JUST ONE POUND TO A LITTLE KNOWN COMPANY RETAIL ACQUISITIONS ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS ARE NOW AT RISK A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE DISCUSSIONS TOLD ME IT'S ANTICIPATED A DECISION WILL BE MADE TODAY ON WHETHER TO SELL B.H.S. OR WIND IT UP
IT'S ON A KNIFE EDGE WITH ONLY ONE SERIOUS POSSIBLE BUYER LEFT IN THE RACE WITH US THIS MORNING IS NICK HOOD A RETAIL AND INSOLVENCY EXPERT FROM OPUS RESTRUCTURING MORNING NICK MORNING ROB HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A CLOSE RUN THING BUT BECAUSE THE THE PROBLEM WITH B.H.S. IS IT'S A SPRAWLING OUT OF DATE TIRED BRAND AND I THINK MOST RETAIL EXPERTS WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT FITS INTO THE CATEGORY BIT LIKE WOOLWORTHS WATSON TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
I'VE BEEN TOO BIG AND TOO EXPENSIVE TO FIX AND THAT'S WHY THE MAJOR PLAYERS THE PEOPLE WHO'RE CIRCLE ROUND IN THE EARLY DAYS AFTER THE ADMINISTRATORS WERE APPOINTED HAVE ALL BACKED AWAY AND WE'RE LEFT WITH JUST ONE BIDDER BUT THERE IS SOMEBODY INTERESTED IN BUYING IT SO HOW COULD IT STILL BE THAT THE COMPANY COULD GO TO THE WALL BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATOR HAS A VERY SIMPLE TASK HE CAN'T BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT ABOUT THEIR JOBS OR THE BRAND OR THE HISTORY HE HAS TO DO AYE LAW THE BEST JOB IN THE INTERESTS OF
ALL THE CREDITORS SO YOU CAN'T SINGLE OUT THE EMPLOYEES AND AS A SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP HE SIMPLY HAS TO DO THE DEAL AND IT COULD WELL BE THAT BREAKING IT UP AND SELLING OFF THEIR FLAGSHIP STORES MAY GIVE HIM MORE MONEY THAN ANY AMOUNT BEING OFFERED BY THAT ONE BIDDER AND HE HAD AND THAT'S THE DECISION HE HAS TO TAKE RIGHT SO WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATOR LOOKING FOR TODAY THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BIGGEST SUM OF MONEY BUT A BUYER COULD BE OFFERING NO NOT KNOW HIM AND HE'S HE'S HE'S DOING A SIMPLE CALCULATION OF IF I BREAK IT UP AND I SELL THE
THE ASSETS HOW MUCH DO I GET VERSES HOW MUCH TRIBE AND MY BEING OFFERED BY THE BIDDER AND AND IT'S NO MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT IF THE ADMINISTRATOR DOES DECIDE TO WIND UP B.H.S. PUT THAT RETAIL FAILURE INTO CONTEXT FOR US
I MEAN IT WE'RE BACK TO WOOLWORTHS AGAIN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I MEAN A MAJOR COLLAPSE HAVE BEEN A WHOLE STRING OF THEM OVER THERE OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS BEEN HERE MANY MANY TIMES BUT IN TERMS OF A HIT TO THE HIGH STREET AND A BLOW TO HIGH STREET RETELLING BRICKS AND MORTAR RETAILING THIS IS THIS IS A SERIOUS BLOW IT'S A IT'S A SEMINAL MOMENT I THINK IN WHERE THE HIGH STREET IS GOING WHERE RETAIL IS GOING
GIVEN YOUR PRETTY DAMNING ANALYSIS OF B.H.S. TRUE EARLIER ON I'M GETTING YOU THINK THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES BUY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A GREAT FUTURE I WILL NO I'M A LITTLE IT'LL HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY RESHAPED RE FOCUSED THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE COMPETITION IN THEIR KEY AREAS LIKE LIGHTING AND FURNITURE AND CLOTHING WHERE THEY'RE BEING ATTACKED BY NIMBLER RICH COMPETITORS AND IT HAS TO FIND A REASON FOR BEING A RETAILER
AND SOMETHING THAT WILL BRING PEOPLE INTO THE IT INTO THE STORE'S NOT JUST ITS ITS EXISTING DEMOGRAPHIC BUT YOU CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S A HUGE TASK IN MODERN RETAIL WERE SITTING ALONGSIDE YOU ARE NODDING ALONG TO AN AWFUL LOT OF WHAT YOU SAID THERE IS DOMINIC ROSSI OFF MARKETS GUESS THIS MORNING THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL MORNING DOMINIC MORNING YOU SEEM TO AGREE THAT THAT B.H.S. IS A TIRED RETAIL I THINK YOU HAD A VERY GOOD APPRAISAL OF THE SITUATION THEY'RE IN THE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS WITHIN RETAILING HAVE CHANGED
LARGELY BECAUSE OF ONLINE REET OOP OOP RETAILING AND THEREFORE THE COST OF SUCCESS ON THE HIGH STREET IS HOUSE HAS GONE UP
AND IT'S IN ITS ONLY STORES SUCH AS DEBENHAMS AND JOHN LEWIS WHO HAD REALLY CONSISTENTLY INVESTED IN THEIR STORE FORMAT OVER MANY MANY YEARS THAT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAPPENED AT B.H.S. WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROCESS OF B.H.S. ALL THEIR WIDER LESSONS THAT WE CAN DRAW FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS ABOUT THE WAY THAT RETAILER'S EITHER DEAL WITH THEIR PENSION FUNDS OR THE WAY THAT PERHAPS BUSINESS RATES ARE DEALT WITH IN TERMS OF RETAILERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT V.H.S. WAS HOBBLED BY A VERY EXPENSIVE STORE BASE I THINK THE BUSINESS RATE ISSUE FOR RETAILERS IS GOING TO BE A GROWING ISSUE
HERE NOT LEAST BECAUSE THE WHOLE HIGH STREET IS GOING TO BE UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF AMAZON AND ANDY CAN'T HAVE ON BECAUSE OF ONLINE SHOPPING
O.K. THANKS DOMINIC STAY WELL AND THANK YOU TO NICOLA FROM OPUS RESTRUCTURING OF THE PAST TWO YEARS THE PRICE OF OIL HAS DROPPED SHARPLY FROM AROUND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO LESS THAN THIRTY DOLLARS A BARREL EARLIER THIS YEAR IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE PRICE HAS CREPT BACK UP TO ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS AND MINISTERS FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST OIL PRODUCING NATIONS WILL BE DISCUSSING THE PRICE LATER AMID A CLASH OVER WHETHER TO CUT PRODUCTION
AROUND ONCE THE THIRTY MEMBERS OF OPEC THE ORGANISATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO SCRAP A CEILING ON THE AMOUNT OF OIL THE NATIONS PUMP WITH US IS MIZ WHEN MY HESSIAN OIL ANALYST BARCLAYS MORNING GOOD MORNING OPEC STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN TO LET THE OIL PRICE PLUNGE IN THE HOPE IT KILLS OFF IT SERIOUS RIVAL FRAC AS IN AMERICA HAS IT WORKED
IT HAS AND IT'S TAKEN US ON TIME TO START SORT OF FEEDING INTO THE IRON MIKE IT BUT ALL THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS AS YOU'VE SAID WITH THE PRICE WHILE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE FIRST CRACK SO U.S. PRODUCTION STARTING TO FALL AND THAT IN OTHER PLACES IT IS NOT SEE HERE AS WELL US AS FOR COUNTRIES AS BRAZIL FOR INSTANCE WHERE OUR PRODUCTION HAS AT FOUR BECAUSE PRODUCERS CAN'T MAKE MONEY AT
PUT IT OUT OF THE BARREL SO IT CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACT SO IN THIS GLOBAL GAME OF CHICKEN ESSENTIALLY WOULD'VE BOUGHT IT WHICH IS WHAT IT HAS BITTEN OPEC DESPITE THE SHORT TERM FINANCIAL PAIN FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF OIL PRODUCING NATIONS OPEC IS WINNING YES AS DISORGANISED THEIR MEETINGS HAVE BEEN AS MUCH AS POLITICS AS TRUMP ECONOMICS AND MOST OF THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE SO THE OWN EXCEPT
THEY ARE GETTING THEIR MARKET SHARE BUT AT A COST AS YOU'VE SAID THERE THEY ARE AND GETTING LESSER REVENUES OVERALL DESPITE HAVING INCREASED MARKET CHAIR THERE IS THIS SPLIT BETWEEN ON THE ONE SIDE AND OTHERS THAT WANT ESSENTIALLY TO SCRAP AN AWFUL LOT OF COORDINATION WITH OPEC AND SAUDI ARABIA WHICH SEEMS DESPERATE TO KEEP THE GROUPING TOGETHER SO THAT DOES OPEC
I HAVE A PURPOSE ANY MORE NO IT'S IT'S BECOME AN EX ESSENTIAL QUESTION FOR THIS HOTEL LETTERS THAT CAN CONTROLS ONE COAT OF OIL PRODUCTION BASICALLY AND IT'S BEEN A CASE WHERE A SAUDI RUN TENSIONS HAVE FLARED UP MORE THAN IN MORE THAN JUST ONE READING AND EVEN IN THIS MEETING
BOTH OF THEM DON'T SEEM TO BE A GREEN A NOWHERE PRODUCTION SHOULD BE AND THAT'S WHERE THE SELL THESE AND THE ONIONS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE LARGER GROUPS OF US TO SAY SO IT WILL BE A RECURRING THEME IN PRESUMABLY THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR OIL CONSUMERS OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY COS THERE ARE BRINGING MORE BARRELS AT THE MARKET SAUDI ARABIA'S RETALIATING THEY SAYING O.K. IF YOU'RE BRINGING MORE BARRELS AFTER THE SANCTIONS WE SHALL ALSO PUMP BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS SAUDI ARABIA'S THE ONLY COUNTRY
WHICH HAS SPARE CAPACITY THE ONE THEY CAN ACTUALLY BOOST PRODUCTION IF THEY WANTED AND THEY'RE ALSO GOING ON THEN SO IT'S A CASE BROUGHT THESE PRODUCERS ARE NOW COMPETING HAD DONE RIGHT GET YOUR CRYSTAL BALL OUT THEN THE OIL PRICE HAS RECOVERED A BIT IN RECENT MONTHS WHERE DOES IT GO IT'S ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS TODAY
YEAH SO WITH THE BARCLAYS FORECAST FOR Q. THREE IS AROUND FORTY ONE DOLLARS A BARREL SO MUCH LOWER THAN WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT BUT Q. FOUR WE HAD A GOOD COVERING AGAIN AT FIFTY TWO AND WE HAVE SIXTY DOLLARS A BARREL AGAIN AND ON AVERAGE NEXT YEAR SO IT'S A BIT AROUND THE LEVEL IT'S AT AT THE MOMENT YEAH BUT WITH A LOT OF VOLATILITY
THERE O.K. THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN AN OIL ANALYST AT BARKY AS WELL THAT DOMINIC ROSSI IS STILL WITH US FROM FIDELITY INTERNATIONAL WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO THE SHARE PRICE OF OIL COMPANIES IN RECENT WEEKS AS THE OIL PRICE HAS BEEN SO VOLATILE THEY THEY BASICALLY HAD TRACKED THE AND THE COMMODITY
PRETTY REASONABLY WELL I MEAN MOST OF THE OIL COMPANIES HAD HAD A VERY DIFFICULT YOU'RE IN THE MARKET LAST YEAR THEY CUT BACK ON THEIR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MUCH TO PROTECT THEIR DIVIDEND LEVELS IN TRUTH WHICH SUPPORTED VALUATIONS AND HAVE RECOVERED AND PARTIALLY WITH THE OLD PRICE THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT THEIR FORTUNES ARE GOING TO BE DOMINATED BY THE OVERALL
PRICE AND I AND I SHARE THE EARLIER COMMENTS I THINK IRAN IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS AND SO LONG AS THE IRANIANS WANT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH THEY DO OTHER PROSPECTS OF ANY COMPROMISED DEALER OPAQUE VALUE VERY SLIM POSSIBILITY DO YOU THINK THAT OPAQUE IS HE'S LOSING INFLUENCE ON THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET AND THE WAY THAT MIZ WE WERE SUGGESTING I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS IN OPAQUE IT'S HISTORY
IT HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WAS A PERIOD AT IT THEN REASSERTED ITSELF TEN YEARS LATER SO I DON'T THINK ONE SHOULD EVER WRITE OUT OF OPEC BUT CERTAINLY THE CURRENT TENSION BETWEEN IRAN
SAUDI DOES MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR NOW AT LEAST TO HAVE ANY KIND OF A UM A DEAL RIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CURRENCY MARKETS THE COST OF PROTECTING AGAINST VOLATILITY IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND HAS JUMPED TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE THE DAYS AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS JUST EXPLAIN VERY SIMPLY WHAT THIS MEAT BASICALLY IT MEANS IT IS THAT STIRLING COUNTS PARTICULAR STERLING DOLLAR RATE TODAY IS IS A ONE TRICK PONY IN THE SENSE THAT THE ONI A FACTOR WHICH IS REALLY GOVERNING
IN THE DIRECTION OF STERLING AT THE MOMENT IN OUR BRECHT'S IT POLES AND INVESTORS ARE TAKING A LOT OF INSURANCE AGAINST AND STIRLING IN THE RUNNER
TO THIS REFERENDUM WITH A VIEW THAT WERE WE TO LEAVE THE E.U. I THINK THAT THERE IS A SENSE WITHIN THE CITY
STERLING AGAINST THE DONNA WOULD FALL TO ABOUT ONE TWENTY SO SO THE DOWNSIDE RISKS TO STIRLING WHAT WITH BREAKS IT OF A VERY HIGH RIGHT IS IT THE CASE THAT THE COST OF THIS CURRENCY PROTECTION IS ESSENTIALLY MOVING IN TANDEM WITH THE OPINION POLLS HAS ABSOLUTELY
AND SO WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH INVESTORS MIND IS IT IS IT THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT NOT KNOWING WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM COULD BE OR IS IT THAT THEY ARE FEARFUL OF A PARTICULAR OUTCOME I THINK IT'S THE ASYMMETRY OF THE RISK I THINK IF WE REMAIN IN THE E.U. THE PROSPECTS OF A STERLING ARE RALLYING FROM THESE LEVEL IS HIS MODEST A FEW PER CENT
WHEREAS WHERE WE TWO TO LEAVE THE DOWNSIDE WOULD WOULD BEEP MATERIALLY GREATER WRITE ANOTHER STORY I'D LIKE YOU TO COMMENT ON A FEW YOU MAY WE HAD YESTERDAY ABOUT THE PROPOSED TWENTY ODD BILLION POUND MERGER BETWEEN THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE AND DEUTSCHE BALLS THEY HAVE SAID THAT IF THIS MERGER GOES AHEAD IT COULD BE MORE THAN A THOUSAND JOB LOSSES ACROSS THE TWO XCHANGE GROUPS
THERE ARE ALWAYS THESE KIND OF COST CUTTING MEASURES WHEN MERGERS TAKE PLACE IS THIS PERHAPS BIGGER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE EXPECTED I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO PLATFORMS AND PART OF THE RATIONALE FOR THE MERGER WORK WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WERE COST SYNERGIES AND AND I THINK THE L.S.E. HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT NOW
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU DOMINIC DOMINIC ROSSI THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICE AT FIDELITY THEY SHOW MUCH WROTE TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX GARY SPORT JOHN NICK GOOD MORNING TO YOU TRUDE AND THE VENUE FOR THIS YEAR'S OPEN GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP IS TO HOLD A VOTE AT THE START OF NEXT MONTH ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ADMIT WOMEN MEMBERS TROON IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY REMAINING COURSE ON THE NINE STRONG OPEN ROTA

WHEN THE FATHER WHO HAS LIVED HERE FOR MANY YEARS BUT STILL RETAINS HIS BRITISH CITIZENSHIP AND THE MOTHER WHO WAS BORN IN EL SALVADOR DISCOVERED THROUGH D.N.A. TESTING THAT THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN THE WRONG BABY AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO THEIR SON IN A HOSPITAL IN SAN SALVADOR THE BABIES WERE SWAPPED BACK THAT HAPPENED LOST SEPTEMBER BUT SINCE NAME THIS COUPLE HAS BEEN LOST IN THIS
GLACIAL PROCESS TO GET A NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND THEREFORE TO GET A PASSPORT TO BRING THEIR SON HOME ONLY GOT THAT
JUST OVER A WEEK OR SO AGO AND THEY FLEW BACK TO DALLAS ON TUESDAY I SPOKE TO THEM HERE YESTERDAY EVENING THEY SAY THEY'VE HAD THE BEST NIGHT'S SLEEP IN A LONG WHILE THEY SAY THEY FEEL SAFE HERE THE MOTHER MERCY COACHWORK
THAT SHE ALWAYS HAD A SUSPICION THAT THE BABY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE EYES OF THEIR PARENTS BUT RICH CASH WORTH TOLD ME THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM
I JUST ACCEPTED IT IS MY CHILD AND NOW I LOOK BACK AT THE PICTURES AROUND THE TIME THAT WE CAME TO DOUSE WHEN HE WAS THREE MONTHS OLD AND I'M SHOCKED THAT I NEVER SUSPECTED BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S JUST OBVIOUSLY
NOT MY CHILD IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE PICTURES HOW I DIDN'T I I DON'T KNOW HOW I DIDN'T ASK MYSELF YOU JUST YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THESE STAIRS LEANING WE WERE HERE WE WERE IN LOVE WITH THE BABY
EVEN WHEN I DID THAT THE N.H.S. I THOUGHT I WAS BETRAYING HIM THAT WAS A FEELING I HAD I'M BETRAYING MY SON BUT I CAN LIVE WITH THIS WHAT WITH THE RESULTS OF THE D.N.A. TO
ZERO POINT ZERO PER CENT THE MOTHER OF THE BABY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THAT WAS YOUR SON IMPOSSIBLE ZERO POINT ZERO
AND YOU HEARD MERCY COACH WITH THAT THEY WERE IN LOVE WITH THAT CHILD LIKE THAT SHE SAID IT WAS INCREDIBLY HARD TO HAND BACK THE BABY THAT THEY'VE NURTURED FOR THOSE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF ITS LIFE
OF COURSE THERE WAS THE THOUGHT ABOUT IF THAT WASN'T THEIR CHILD THEN WHERE WAS THEIR BABY BOY AND WHAT THEY DID TO GET THEIR BABY BOY MOSES BACK IN THE END WE KNOW THAT NOW BUT THEY'RE STILL NO CLOSER TO KNOWING
WHY THIS HAPPENED THEY THEY CLEARLY HAVE THEIR SUSPICIONS RICH SAYS THAT IF THERE ARE PERPETRATORS THEN BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE IS IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE ALSO BEING VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A LEGAL
PROCESS GOING ON IN EL SALVADOR HAVING SAID THAT THE DOCTOR HIMSELF THAT DELIVERED THEIR BABY
DID ORIGINALLY HAVE CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST HIM ON A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ALL THOSE CHARGES WERE DROPPED AND SO I STILL DON'T THINK THE COUPLE THEMSELVES
OR INDEED THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR AND THIS TOWN DALLAS IN TEXAS ARE ANY CLOSER TO KNOWING WHY ALL THIS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE
MORE ON THAT LATER THANKS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN THE BRITISH AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS ARE CALLING ON THE UNITED NATIONS TO PROVE AIR DROPS OF EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPLIES TO BESIEGED AREAS IN SYRIA NICK BRYANT IS A UNITED NATIONS CORRESPONDENT IN NEW YORK WHEN HE SPOKE TO HIM A LITTLE WHILE AGO I ASKED HIM WHAT TRIGGERED THIS CALL
LAST MONTH THE INTERNATIONAL SERIOUS SUPPORT GROUP WHICH INCLUDES BRITAIN THE UNITED STATES RUSSIA AND IRAN SET DURING THE FIRST AS THE DEADLINE FOR THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW HUMANITARIAN AID INTO ALL PERCEIVES THAT SIMPLY HASN'T HAPPENED YESTERDAY A COMPO'S DID REACH TO REBEL HELP COMMUNITIES WHERE THE SITUATION IS PARTICULARLY CHRONIC BUT ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHILE THE AID INCLUDED MEDICAL SUPPLIES OF VACCINES BABY MILK POWDER IT DIDN'T INCLUDE FOOD
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND AS DESCRIBED THAT AS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE THE AMERICANS HAVE COMPLAINED IT'S FAR FROM SUFFICIENT SO THEY WANT THE UN TO START DELIVERING AID THROUGH AN AIR DROPS VERY MUCH A LAST RESORT VERY MUCH BY THE SOUNDS OF IT A SIGN OF FRUSTRATION THAT THE IRANIANS THE RUSSIANS ARE NOT DELIVERING FROM THE ASAD GOVERNMENT THE ACCESS THAT WAS WANTED
YEP LAST RESORT HAS EXACTLY THE LANGUAGE THAT PHILIP HAMMOND USE BECAUSE AS HE PUT IT AIR DROPS ARE COMPLEX THEY'RE COSTLY THEIR RISKY THE U.N. ALSO FEARS THAT HIS PLANES COULD BE SHOT OUT OF THE SKY BY THE SYRIAN AIR FORCE UNLESS THEY'RE GRANTED AUTHORISATION BY THE ASSAD REGIME NOW PHILIP WANTS THE RUSSIANS AND IRANIANS TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW FOR AIR DROPS THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH HIS OPPOSITE NUMBER SERGEI LAVROV YESTERDAY TOO
THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS WERE TALLY SHIRKING WELCOME THE EIGHT DELIVERIES AS A POSITIVE STEP AND SUGGESTS THAT THE PLANS TO AIRDROP HUMANITARIAN RELIEF
COULD BE PUT ON HOLD FOR AN HOUR SO AT THE MOMENT THE RUSSIANS MUCH TO THE FRUSTRATION OF THE WEST JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE PLAYING BALL IT BRYANT THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN JEREMY CORBIN'S GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH TODAY WARNING BUT IT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THIS COUNTRY IF WE PULL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION NORMAN SMITH IS ON A SYSTEM POLITICAL EDITOR WE HAVEN'T HEARD A GREAT DEAL FROM MY CALLED ENDURING THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN MOMENT
CERTAINLY NOT MUCH THAT HAS MADE ANY WAYS I THINK THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT UNDER LABOUR MOVEMENT NOW THAT THEY NEED TO CHANGE GEAR DRAMATICALLY OR RISK LOSING THIS REFERENDUM SO YESTERDAY WE HAD THE T.U.C. COMING OUT WITH THEIR WARNING ABOUT CUTS TO AVERAGE WAGES TODAY WE GET JEREMY CORBIN WARNING ABOUT THE DANGER TO PEOPLE'S BASIC EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS HAVE WE LEAVE THE E.U. IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE GUARANTEED HOLIDAYS
EQUAL PAY PROTECTION FOR PART TIME WORKERS MATERNITY PAY ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS WHICH HE SAYS WILL BE AT RISK IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AS SAYING I THINK THERE ARE MANY OF THESE RIGHTS ACTUALLY ARE GUARANTEED AN EXTENDED UNDER BRITISH LAW NEVER MIND E.U. LAWS SO IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE MATERNITY PAY YES IT'S TRUE THAT THE E.U. GUARANTEES TWELVE WEEKS PAID LEAVE BUT ACTUALLY BRITISH LAW INCREASES THAT TO FIFTY TWO WEEKS THAT SAID
IT IS TERRAIN WHICH THE LABOUR MOVEMENT IS COMFORTABLE WITH IT CLEARLY MATTERS TO MILLIONS OF VOTERS HAD SOME ISSUE WHICH THEY HOPE WILL GALVANISE THEIR SUPPORT I THINK THE DANGER IS IT AVOIDS THE BULLET AND THE BULLET BLUNTLY
HE'S IMMIGRATION BECAUSE NOT JUST THE FACT THAT IT'S AN ISSUE IN THIS REFERENDUM BUT IT MATTERS PROFOUNDLY TO LABOUR VOTERS BECAUSE MIGRANTS DON'T SETTLE IN COMFORTABLE LEAFY SUBURBS THEY SETTLED BY AND LARGE IN DEPRIVED INNER CITY COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T TAKE THE JOBS OF MIDDLE CLASS PROFESSIONALS THEY GO FOR LOW PAID UNSKILLED WORK
AND THE LABOUR MOVEMENT HAS REALLY NOT ADDRESSED DECISION AND IT'S INTERESTING THIS MORNING WE HEAR FROM THE LEADER OF THE G.M.P. BE TIMBER ACTUALLY SAYS LET ME JUST QUOTE YOU WHAT HE SAYS HE SAYS WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE REAL ISSUE ON WORKING PEOPLE'S MINDS WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT TOP FRONT AND CENTRE THAT IS IMMIGRATION AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND TO DATE
IT SEEMS TO ME MISTER CORBIN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT HAVE HAD PRETTY MUCH ZILCH TO SAY ON THAT ISSUE AND CERTAINLY TODAY IN THE PRE BRIEFING WE'VE HAD FROM HE CALLED IN SPEECHES JUST MENTIONED IN PASSING WITH A REFUGEE CRISIS AND I SUSPECT THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A PROFOUND SENSE OF SELF DOUBT ABOUT HOW THEY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN AS ANTI IMMIGRANT OR ANTI RACIST BUT THEY KNOW IT MATTERS MASSIVELY TO THEIR PEOPLE AND MISTER OSBORNE LEADING FIGURE OBVIOUSLY IN THERE REMAIN THE CAMP IS TRYING
DESPERATELY SHIFTED OFF IMMIGRATION HE'S ATTACKED BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO FOR MAKING UP PLANS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY HE HAS WRITTEN A JOINT LETTER WITH ALISTAIR DARLING ISSUING A SERIES OF CHALLENGES OVER THE ECONOMY TO THE BRICKS AT CAMP
I MEAN WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT TO SOME EXTENT IS THE FACT THAT HERE WE HAVE ANOTHER LABOUR FIGURE ALISTAIR DARLING AND WORKING WITH MISTER OSBORNE WE SAW ED BALLS APPEARING WITH HIM IN THE OTHER DAY WE SAW SIDDIQUE KHAN APPEARING WITH DAVID CAMERON AND THAT TELLS US ANOTHER TRUTH ABOUT THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN THERE IS A PROFOUND TENSION ABOUT HOW FAR THEY SHOULD ENGAGE WITH THE BROAD REMAIN CAMPAIGN BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE JEREMY CORBIN AND JOHN MCDONNELL LOOK BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM WHEN THEY DID CO OPERATE WITH THE BROADER
CROSS PARTY CAMPAIGN AND THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS DISASTROUS FOR THE LABOUR VOTE AND THERE'S A REAL TENSION WITHIN THE LABOUR SIDE ABOUT HOW FAR THEY SHOULD CO OPERATE AND HOW FAR THEY SHOULD JUST STAND BACK AND LET THIS REFERENDUM UNFOLD AS A TORY CIVIL WAR ONE LAST THING JOHN TIM RICH IN HIS ARTICLE TODAY ALSO SAYS OF MISTER CORBIN HE'S A HALF HEARTED
REMAIN AND I THINK THAT TOO IS IMPACTING ON THE LABOUR VOTE BECAUSE LABOUR PEOPLE IF THEY TAKE THE VIEW WELL OUR LEADER'S NOT THAT BOTHERED THEN THEY ARE GOING TO CONCLUDE WHY SHOULD WE BE THAT BOTHERED NORMAN THANK YOU
TURNER TWENTY TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THERE'S A GENERAL WELCOME FOR THE DECISION TO REOPEN THE INQUEST INTO THE BIRMINGHAM PUB BOMBINGS THE TIME SAYS THE ATTACKS BY THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. RANK AS ONE OF BRITAIN'S WORST TERRORIST OUTRAGES AND THE FACTS HAVE TO BE LAID BARE IT CALLS ON THE CORONER TO IDENTIFY THE PRIME SUSPECTS TOO MANY CRIMES IT SAYS HAVE BEEN BURIED FOR THE SAKE OF KEEPING THE PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND THE DAILY MAIL SAYS THE INQUEST MUST FOCUS ON THE COLD BLOODED EVIL OF THE MURDERER'S NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE
AND NOT BE SIDETRACKED BY POLICE FAILINGS OR THE WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT OF THE BIRMINGHAM SIX THE NEWSPAPER SAYS THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES HOPE THEIR CONCLUSIONS MIGHT BE AS FAR REACHING AS THE RECENT INQUEST INTO THOSE WHO DIED AT HILLSBOROUGH BUT THE SUN SAYS EXPERTS ARE WARNING THAT IT MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE IN SPITE OF THE NAMES OF THE I.R.A. MEN INVOLVED BEING AN OPEN SECRET IN DUBLIN THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT UNLESS THE PROVISIONAL I.R.A. BREAKS WITH GENERATIONS OF PRACTICE
AND ALLOWS THE SURVIVING BOMBERS TO STEP INTO THE SPOTLIGHT CONFESS AND FACE SENTENCES IT IS HOLY UNLIKELY THAT EVERY QUESTION WILL BE ANSWERED DEFINITIVELY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH BELIEVES THE FORTHCOMING REFERENDUM IS INCREASINGLY BEING CAST NOT JUST AS A VOTE ON THE E.U. BUT ON DAVID CAMERON'S RECORD IN OFFICE IS MANY PROMISES ON REDUCING MIGRATION THE PAPER COMMENTS REMAIN EMBARRASSINGLY UNFULFILLED THE TIMES DETECTS THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
HE'S WINNING SUPPORT BY ADVOCATING AUSTRALIAN POINT SYSTEM TO CONTROL MIGRATION BUT THIS IS THE FREE FLOW OF LABOUR IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY THE DRAWBRIDGE CANNOT BE RAISED IT SAYS NOR SHOULD IT BE THE GUARDIAN OF THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY IS MAKING FURTHER CONCESSIONS ON THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL KNOWN BY ITS CRITICS AS THE SNOOPERS CHARTER GARDEN WILL BE A NEW PRIVACY CLAWS
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SNOOPING POWERS ARE NOT AUTHORISED IN SITUATIONS WHERE LESS INTRUSIVE MEANS CAN BE USED THE DAILY MIRROR MAX CAUSED BY A JUDGE FOR AN URGENT REVIEW OF THE LAW ON ELDERLY DRIVERS AFTER EIGHT SCHOOLGIRLS WERE INJURED BY AN EIGHT YEAR OLD MOTORIST WHO PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE SHE WAS BANNED FROM DRIVING FOR LIFE AND GIVEN A SUSPENDED PRISON SENTENCE THE PAPERS AS NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE DRIVING LICENCES AWAY FROM THE ELDERLY BUT STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THEY CAN STILL DRIVE SAFELY
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ANOTHER HEARTBREAKING CRASH MANY PAPERS REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF BRITAIN'S OLDEST HAND WRITTEN WORDS RECORDS FROM ROMAN TIMES UNEARTHED IN LONDON'S FINANCIAL DISTRICT THE SAYS THE WOODEN TABLETS PORTRAIT LONDON NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO AS THE WILD WEST OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AS CARPET BAGGERS POURED INTO THE CITY HOPING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK THE TIMES OF LONDON WAS A PLACE OF DISREPUTABLE TRADERS FINANCES WITH POOR JUDGEMENT
AND BEER LOVERS IT DEN SAYS HOW THINGS CHANGE UNRELIEVED ICE IT SAYS SEVENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST PROMINENT UNI LEADERS TIM RICH IN THE G. B. SAYS LABOUR MUST DO MORE TO PUSH THE CASE FOR BRITAIN STAYING IN THE E.U.
FORGET THOSE CAMPAIGN BUSES THAT PLEDGES THE CLAIMS IN THE COUNTER CLAIMS BEHIND THE DAILY SOUND AND FURY IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BOTH SIDES ARE DEPLOYING SOPHISTICATED TARGETING TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFYING CONVINCED THE VOTERS THEY THINK COULD DECIDE THE FINAL RESULT OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS HAS BEEN HEARING HER FROM INSIDE THE RIVAL CAMPAIGNS
AWAY FROM THE SPEECHES AND THE PROTESTS THERE'S A BATTLE TO CONVINCE VOTERS NOT IN CROWDS BUT ONE BY ONE THE REFERENDUM OF COURSE IT'S A NATIONAL POLL EVERY VOTE ANYWAY ACCOUNTS INSIDE LEAVES HEADQUARTERS THE SEARCH IS ON FOR THE EURO SCEPTICS
WHO WILL ACTUALLY TURN OUT TO VOTE ON REFERENDUM DAY STEVEN PARKINSON IN CHARGE OF THEIR GROUND CAMPAIGN TELLS ME THAT'S TAKING THEM TO PLACES OFTEN OVERLOOKED AT ELECTIONS YOU MIGHT SEE TRADITIONALLY VERY SAFE PARLIAMENTARY SEATS WHICH AREN'T COMPETITIVE AT GENERAL ELECTIONS PLACES LIKE THE FENS PLACES LIKE LINCOLNSHIRE WHERE THERE'S A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF OF LIKELY LEAVE
VOTERS AND WHERE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ACTIVE ON THE GROUND MANY OF THOSE LIKELY LEAVE VOTERS ARE OLDER AND LESS WELL OFF LEAVE OF USE SOFTWARE TO AUTOMATICALLY SCOUR RHYS AND ELECTION RESULTS TO FIND THEM AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR BOTH SIDES TO CREATE SOPHISTICATED VOTED TARGETING CAMPAIGNS FROM SCRATCH IN JUST A FEW MONTHS
DATA THAT REVEALS NOT JUST HOW OLD OR RICH VOTERS IN ANY GIVEN ROW OF HOMES ARE BUT WHAT THEY EAT AND DRINK ALL READ EVEN WHAT THEY THINK
HELPING TO REVEAL NOT ONLY SUREFIRE SUPPORTERS WERE PRECIOUS UNDECIDED VOTERS JERRY CAN A U.S. CONSULTANT HAS BEEN FIGHTING REFERENDUMS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THEY HAVE TO PERSUADE THE PERSUADABLE
AND RIGHT NOW BASED ON THE DATA THAT I HAVE SEEN ABOUT TWENTY SOME PER CENT MAYBE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE PER SAT A FEMALE VOTERS MAY TEND TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL
WHEN THEY MAKE DECISIONS THAT IS A DEMOGRAPHIC THAT I WOULD BE TODDLING RIGHT NOW IN THE CAMPAIGN
HE'S WORKED WITH THE OTHER LEAVE CAMPAIGN LEVY YOU REMAIN AS HAVE THEIR OWN MESSAGE YEAH PRIME MINISTER A LAWYER TO LAUNCH THE
AND THEIR OWN AMERICAN JIM OR SINA HELP BARACK OBAMA IN LAST YEAR THE CONSERVATIVES TO VICTORY
EITHER RING DIFFERENT MESSAGES FOR DIFFERENT VOTERS IN DIFFERENT PLACES REMAIN DIRECTOR WILL STRAW IS VERY FRANK HE'S DOING JUST THAT FOR THEM IN THIS REFERENDUM THE ECONOMY'S THEIR CENTRAL ISSUE
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN SOME AREAS WORKERS' RIGHTS WILL MATTER TO PEOPLE IN SOME AREAS IT'LL BE JOBS RATHER THAN ANOTHER ISSUE THAT MATTERS TO THEM IN SOME PLACES IT'LL BE PRICES AND WE CAN THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHICH MESSAGES WE CENTRE WHICH PHOTO
WORKERS' RIGHTS JOBS PRICES THE VERY MESSAGES SOME REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS FACED SIMPLY REACHING LABOUR VOTERS CAKE THE MILLER SO FROM NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY STUDYING THE CAMPAIGNS
LABOUR'S ROLLERS IN LONDON TEND TO BE MORE AFFLUENT MORE EDUCATED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS REFERENDA THEY TEND TO BE MORE PRO EUROPE IF WE MAKE THAT COMPARISON TO THE NORTH WHERE THEY VOTERS TEND TO BE MORE VULNERABLE MORE WORKING CLASS
THEY TEND TO BE MORE FAVOURABLE TOWARDS BRACKS IN A NOISY CONTEST TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP OVERCOME GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES LIKE THAT
PROVIDED THE CAMPAIGN MESSAGES AND THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY THEM AH GOOD
AND IF THEY'RE NOT NO DATABASE NO SOFTWARE WILL PUT THEM RIGHT
TALKING'S REPORT IN THERE THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO SEVEN WE KNOW THAT SPECIES CAN CHANGE OVER TIME ONE PRETTY SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE IS THE BRITISH PEPPERED MOTH THEY TURN BLACK DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WHAT SCIENTISTS DON'T KNOW OR DIDN'T KNOW IS HOW THEY MANAGED TO DO IT AND THANKS TO RESEARCHERS AT LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY WE DO WELL SORT OF DOCTOR CAREY IS THE SENIOR LECTURER IN EVOLUTION THERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE THE PEPPERED MOTH IT WENT BLACK BECAUSE IT SORT OF WANTED TO MELD IN WITH THE SOOT STAINED BUILDINGS THAT IT RESTED ON IS THAT RIGHT
BART'S AGENT CAROL ARRIVE AND GIVEN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THEY CAN THEN FIND THEMSELVES IN AN ADVANTAGEOUS AND STATE COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL TIE
RIGHT UM I THINK AND AND WHAT YOU'VE DISCOVERED IS THE SORT OF GENETIC SECRET THAT ENABLED IT TO DO IT YEAH SO ALTHOUGH IT'S A STORY IN BROAD TERMS AS BEEN
SOUNDS RIGHT AND WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN IN NICE SIMPLE LAYMAN'S TERMS THAT MIGHT ENABLE US TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SPECIES CHANGE OVER THE PUBS IN A SAY OVER THE YEARS OVER THE CENTURIES OVER THE MILLENNIA MAYBE
WAS UNUSUAL THAT THE CHANGE IN THE D.N.A. SEQUENCE THAT WE FOUND A SMALL CHANGE WHICH IS
A PARTICULAR GENE WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW ABOUT JEAN FUNCTIONS BUT
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOWED ALL OF THAT BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS IT WAS A DRAMATIC CHANGE DID IT I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT PRESUMABLY IT HAPPENS DOES IT WITH ONE INSECT AND THEN WITH LOTS OF OTHERS IS THAT THE WAY IT WORKS
WE FOUND SOME AND SO YES IT MUST HAVE ORIGINATED FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AND THEN IT EXPANDED THROUGH THE GENERATIONS SPIRIT OR SPRING AND ITS GRAND OFFSPRING AND SO ON THAT'S WHERE ELSE MIGHT IT BE HAPPENING THIS SORT OF THING WELL IT'S NOT ALL THAT IT MIGHT BE
PRODUCING AND CONSUMING AREAS AS WELL AS CONTINENTAL CHRIS JUSTINE HAVE LESS WELL ADVERTISED WELL THAT IS REALLY INTERESTING THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT IT DOCTOR SECONDARY OF LIVERPOOL UNIVERSITY IT IS NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER OR BOTH VITAL COMPONENTS OF A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT BUT A COMMITTED THEN P. SAYS TODAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NEGLECTING THE NEED FOR SOMETHING ELSE
CLEAN SOIL THE GROUND BENEATH OUR FEET NEEDS MORE ATTENTION APPARENTLY THE CHAIR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT COMMITTEE THE LABOUR M.P. MARY CRAY IS HERE AND CAN TELL US
WHY WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT SOIL MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WELL SOIL IS A REAL CINDERELLA ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T RECEIVE THE ATTENTION THAT AIR AND WATER QUALITY DO BUT SOCIETY DEPENDS ON SOIL FOR GROWING OFF FOOD FOR BUILDING OUR CITIES AND FOR STORING CARBON AND TO PREVENT FLOODING AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WANTS ALSO HAS TO BE MANAGED SUSTAINABLY BY TWENTY THIRTY A COMMITTEE COULDN'T REALLY FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD ANY POLICIES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENED LET'S GO THROUGH YOUR LIST IS IT WHERE START
CONTAMINATED SOIL IN THE CITY'S YOU'RE CRITICISING THE GOVERNMENT FOR FOR REMOVING THE SUBSIDIES THAT WILL CLEAN UP THAT SOIL DEAFER HAD A CONTAMINATED LAND GRANT AND IT WAS IT WAS SEVENTEEN MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND IT'S NOW DOWN TO HALF A MILLION POUNDS A YEAR BRITAIN'S INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE MEANS WE'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF BUILDINGS ON
BILL ON DIFFICULT SITE SOME REP FORMER RAILWAY SITE WE'VE GOT LOTS OF CONTAMINATION FROM CHEMICALS FROM HEAVY METALS AND FROM TAR AND IT BY WITHDRAWING THIS CONTAMINATED LANDSCAPE LAND GRANTS THEY'RE HARMING COUNCILS ABILITY TO CLICK TO IDENTIFY SITES
AND THEN TO CLEAN THEM UP AND OF COURSE THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A BROWNFIELD FIRST POLICY SO WE DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE'S HOMES BUILT IN POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED AREAS AND FOR WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR HOMES ALREADY BUILT IN CONTAMINATED AREAS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THAT LAND AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO WASH THE SOIL AND ONE SCHEME IN WAKEFIELD COST THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND POUNDS TO CLEAN UP MONEY IS NEEDED WE ALSO HEAR THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FLOODS COS WE'RE OFTEN TOLD
BUT ONE REASON FOR FLOODING IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS IS AS IT WERE AGAIN A NEGLECTED THE SOIL AT THE WRONG POLICY YES WHAT WE SEE IS FARMERS SOMETIMES AND PLOUGHING RIGHT UP TO THE FIELD EDGE AND THEN THAT SOIL THE MOST PRECIOUS THING THAT A FARMER HAS BEEN WASHED AWAY INTO THE RIVER SILTING UP RIVERS AND WATER COURSES AND CAUSING FLOODING DOWNSTREAM AND WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE NEW RULES FOR THE FARM PAYMENTS WEREN'T REALLY GOING OUT AND LOOKING TO SEE IF THE SAW WAS IN GOOD HEALTH
AND WE FOUND JUST TWO FARMERS WERE FINDING TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR NOT KEEPING THEIR SOIL IN A GOOD CONDITION WE THINK IS PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT AND THEN LAST DUELLIST AND PERHAPS LEAST FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE WAS THE IDEA THIS WILL IS VITAL FOR COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE YEAH WE'RE REALLY LUCKY IN THE U.K. WE'VE GOT THESE AMAZING BLANKET BOGS BUT SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT MANAGED PROPERLY MANAGED CORRECTLY AND LANDOWNERS BURN THE BULBS AND THEY WANT TO HAVE GROUSE ON THEM
AND OF COURSE THIS RELEASES TONS OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND METHANE SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROGRAMME OF BOG RESTORATION I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD BUT SEEDING MOSS FROM HELICOPTERS ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP US MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS
A SOIL AS ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR ELEVEN THOUSAND YEARS IN THE U.K. IT'S INCREDIBLY RICH AND PRODUCTIVE BUT IF WE DON'T LOOK AFTER IT WE RISK NOT BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE THE FOOD THAT WE EAT AND WE RISK CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE INSTEAD OF USING IT TO HELP TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE DAYS NOT MONTHS OR YEARS LET ALONE ELEVEN THOUSANDS AWAY FROM A RATHER IMPORTANT REFERENDUM YOU ARE A LEADING CAMPAIGNER FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. FROM THE LABOUR PARTY
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE GYM BE UNION TIM ROACH HE SAYS YOUR LEADERS BEEN HALF HEARTED IN THIS CAMPAIGN I THINK JEREMY'S GIVEN A VERY PERSONAL AND PROFOUND SPEECH ABOUT HIS JOURNEY FROM EURO SCEPTICISM
TO SUPPORTING HER REMAIN FATE BUT I THINK THE SAME TERRAIN IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT ALL LABOUR VOICES HAVE BEEN CROWDED OUT BY THE CRISIS AND SPLITS ENGULFING THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT COS THE POSTAL VOTES LANDED THIS WEEK AND I'VE HAD EMAILS FROM MY CONSTITUENTS SAYING YOU KNOW I'M A LABOUR VOTER BUT WHAT'S THE LABOUR POSITION AND I FEEL I'VE BEEN SAYING IT CERTAINLY VOCALLY BUT THAT MESSAGE ISN'T GETTING THROUGH ON THE GROUND IT'S HAD TO BE CLEAR THERE ARE SUPPORTERS IF YOUR PARTY LONG TIME SUPPORTERS OF YOUR PART
YOU SIMPLY DON'T KNOW LABOUR'S POSITION ON THIS REFEREE THAT'S CORRECT AND THE DANGER IS THAT WITH THAT OF LEADERS MAKING'S A SPEECH AND THEN THINKING EVERYBODY HE'S HEARD IT AND THAT THE DANGER WE LEARNT THAT LESSON LAST YEAR IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN I THINK WE NEED TO BE TREATING THIS REFERENDUM AS THOUGH IT WAS A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND HAVING EVERYBODY OUT ON THE DOORSTEP AND HAVING A GOOD GROUND CAMPAIGN WE'VE BEEN DOING TELEPHONE CANVASSING IN WAKEFIELD BUT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
WE UNDERSTAND WE TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR WORKING PEOPLE AND HE SAYS THAT THE REAL ISSUES TIM ROACH THE GYM BE A BEING NOT A I'M NOT BEING ADDRESS THAT THE LABOUR PARTY'S KEEPING SILENT AND BY THAT HE MEANS IMMIGRATION
HE'S YES HE'S RIGHT AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET ACROSS TO PEOPLE THAT IF WE LEAVE ANY FUTURE MEMBERSHIP OF WHICH ALLOWS US ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WOULD MEAN THAT WE'D HAVE TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT AND WHEN WE HAVE CHRIS GRAYLING AND BELIEVE CAMPAIGN SAYING THEY WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE ON EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS WHAT THAT MEANS IS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND ENTER PAID HOLIDAYS A MATERNITY LEAVE AND THAT WILL COST AND LEAVING OF COURSE WILL COST BRITISH JOBS AND HER WORKING PEOPLE IN A WORD DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE LOST
I'M ALWAYS ANXIOUS I'M NOT COMPLACENT BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC MERRY CORRECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND LET'S JUST SEE WHETHER JOHN HAMPDEN BUT HE'S OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE WEATHER DO YOU KNOW WHAT JOHN I THINK
THIS WEEKEND WE'RE ALL GOING TO SEE A BIT OF WARMTH AND LOVE ALL THAT FLIPPING LADEN GROW UNTIL YOU HAVE TO BE THE LAW NO THIS THIS WEEKEND JOHN BECAUSE THERE'LL BE SOME SHOWERS AROUND TOO GOOD GROWING WEATHER NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD GROWING WEATHER AT THE MOMENT ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES IT'S CHILLY AGAIN A CLOUDY START TO THE DAY AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS I'M NOT SURE THAT BREEZE TO THE ODD SPOT OF DRIZZLE ACROSS SOME SOUTHERN COUNTIES BUT THAT'LL FADE AWAY AND FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES ACTUALLY THINGS WILL IMPROVE FOR THE DAY ALREADY AT SUNNY ACROSS CUMBRIA WEST LANCASHIRE

WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING A LINEAR STRUCTURE IN WHICH WE PRESENT A SERIES FOR ARGUMENTS
BUT RATHER WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A KIND OF SOUNDED ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE HOPE YOU THE LISTENER WILL MAKE UP YOUR OWN
SELF SEARCH FOR MEANING ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR NEXT MONDAY NIGHT AT ELEVEN
LATER ON THIS PROGRAMME WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF B.H.S. THE FUTURE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND VICARS AND SOMEHOW A ROMAN SLING SHOT SCARED THE ENEMY WITH ITS SOUND YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND NICK ROBINSON
GOOD MORNING IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE SECOND OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST PROMINENT UNION LEADERS TIM ROACH OF THE G. M. B. SAYS LABOUR MUST DO MORE TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR BRITAIN STAYING IN THE EAR
A BRITISH MAN HIS WIFE WHO WERE GIVEN THE WRONG NEW BORN BABY IN EL SALVADOR A YEAR AGO HAS SPOKEN OF THEIR RELIEF AND FINALLY RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR SON
AN N.H.S. REPORT SAYS SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY STAFF IN ENGLAND ARE FACING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT ABUSING IS READ THIS MORNING BY NEIL SLEET THE NEW LEADER OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST UNIONS THE G.M. BEAT TIM ROACH HAS SAID THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL FAIL UNLESS LABOUR VOTERS BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN THE DEBATE
IN THE B. B. C. INTERVIEW HE SAYS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN MUST DO MORE TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. MY CORBIN WILL GIVE A SPEECH TODAY IN WHICH SHE'LL SAY THAT AN X. IT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN WILL SUGGEST THAT STAYING IN WOULD ALLOW THAT YOU CATER HELP REFORM THE E.U. AND RESOLVE THE MIGRATION CRISIS IS A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG
A TORY BUNFIGHT THAT'S HOW TIM ROACH ONE OF THE MOST SENIOR FIGURES IN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT FEARS ARE VOTERS SEE THE REFERENDUM HE CLAIMED WHILE IN HIS WORDS LABOUR HAS BEEN TEARING ITSELF APART THE E.U. DEBATE DEBATES BEEN DOMINATED BY CONSERVATIVES ARGUING AMONGST THEMSELVES
MISTER ROACH HE'S JUST TAKEN OVER THE HELM OF THE GEUM B. Z. UNIONS NEED TO FRESHEN UP BUT HE URGED LABOUR TO GET BEHIND MISTER CORBIN AND CAMPAIGNED VIGOROUSLY TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT LABOUR VOTERS WILL STAY AT HOME I THINK THEY'RE WON'T SEE AS THE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL VOTE THAT IT IS NOW SO I THINK THAT THEY SEE IT AS A BUN FIGHT IN THE TORY PARTY LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS ANY OF US WILL MAKE FOR A GENERATION
THE LABOUR LEADERS EXPECTED TO MAKE A SPEECH LATER ARGUING THAT A VOTE TO STAY IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT WORKERS' RIGHTS BUT THERE ARE ANXIETIES INSIDE THERE ARE MAIN CAMP THAT LABOUR VOTERS MIGHT NOT BOTHER TO VOTE IN A REFERENDUM WITH A LEVELS OF TURNOUT COULD BE DECISIVE AND YOU CAN HEAR A FULL INTERVIEW WITH TIM ROACH ON THE WORLD AT ONE
GEORGE OSBORNE OF THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HAVE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER DEVOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ACCUSING THEM OF COMING UP WITH UN COSTED AND UNWORKABLE PROPOSALS AND CHALLENGING THEM TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING UP POLICIES AS THEY GO ALONG THE PROMINENT EXIT CAMPAIGNER MICHAEL GOPHERS DESCRIBED SUGGESTIONS FROM THE REMAIN CAMP THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HIT TRADE AS ABSURD HE SAYS A BRITISH EXIT WOULD BE A PROCESS OF EVOLUTION NOT REVOLUTION
THE SPANISH PRIME MINISTER MARIANNA RUSH HOI HAS WARNED THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN EXIT VOTE WOULD BE VERY NEGATIVE FOR BRITISH CITIZENS SPEAKING IN MADRID LAST NIGHT SHE SAID PEOPLE FROM THE U.K. WOULD LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO MOVE FREELY WORK AND DO BUSINESS IN THE LARGEST ECONOMIC AREA IN THE WORLD
EARLIER THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK SAID THE E.U. SHOULD ABANDON WHAT HE CALLED ITS UTOPIAN DREAMS OF EVER CLOSER INTEGRATION HE SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE FUELLING EURO SCEPTICISM
I THINK CARL AND IN FACT NAIVE FOR YOUR ANTIPATHY I THINK VISIONS OFF DULL DULL INTEGRATION
REGARDLESS OF THE OBVIOUS GOOD THE PROPONENTS IT'S NOT THEIR FUEL TO ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEM MOULTING ON LULU STOOD A STRENGTHENING GOUGH YOU'RE SCEPTIC MAUDE'S NOT ONLY IN THE U.K.
A BRITISH MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE GIVEN THE WRONG BABY BY HOSPITAL IN EL SALVADOR A YEAR AGO HAVE FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME TO THE U.S. WITH THEIR SON RICHARD CASH WORTH AND HIS WIFE MERCY WHO'S FROM EL SALVADOR WERE ONLY GIVEN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR MOSES A FEW DAYS AGO AT ARRIVED IN DALLAS THIS WEEK OUR CORRESPONDENT MATTHEW PRICE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THEM

AND THEN ANOTHER THOUGHT WHERE'S MY BABY THE CHILDREN WERE HANDED BACK TO THEIR REAL PARENTS EIGHT MONTHS AGO SINCE THEN THE COSH WORTH'S HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A BIRTH CERTIFICATE SO MOSES COULD BE BROUGHT HERE TO THE U.S. THAT HAS NOW FINALLY HAPPENED BUT THE COSH WORTH'S ALMOST BANKRUPT THEY SAY AFTER FIGHTING TO GET THEIR CHILD BACK HOME FOR SO LONG STILL WANT ANSWERS AS TO HOW EXACTLY THE TWO BABIES WERE SWAPPED IN THE FIRST PLACE
THEIR DECISION ON THE FUTURE OF THE HIGH STREET RETAILER B.H.S. IS EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY THE FIRM WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION IN APRIL JUST A YEAR AFTER IT WAS SOLD BY SIR PHILIP GREEN FOR ONE POUND THE COMPANY'S ELEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WILL LEARN WHETHER IT WILL BE SOLD ON OR CLOSE DOWN
AN N.H.S. REPORT SUGGESTS SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF BLACK AND ETHNIC MINORITY STAFF ARE BEING SUBJECTED TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT THE HEALTH SERVICE HAS PUBLISHED DATA FROM ALL TRUSTS ACROSS ENGLAND HERE'S ELAINE DUNKLEY
THE REPORT CALLS FOR ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOUR TO CHANGE WITHIN THE N.H.S. WE'VE OVER THREE QUARTERS OF ALL THE CUTE TRUST SHOWING MORE BLACK MINORITY ETHNIC STUFF THAN THEIR WHITE COLLEAGUES CLAIMING THEY HAD BEEN HARASSED BULLIED OR ABUSED BY THEIR TEAM LEADERS AND MANAGERS
THE REPORT ALSO SAYS BLACK MINORITY ETHNIC OR BE ANY STUFF PHIL LARGELY EXCLUDED FROM SENIOR POSITIONS N.H.S. ENGLAND SAYS IT'S INVESTING TWO MILLION POUNDS TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO ELIMINATE BULLYING THIS INCLUDES TRAINING SEVENTY FIVE MENTORS TO TACKLE RACE DISCRIMINATION BRITAIN FRANCE AND AMERICA HAVE CALLED ON THE UN TO BEGIN DROPS OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO BESIEGED AREAS IN SYRIA
THEY SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ASAD HAD FAILED TO RESPECT YESTERDAY'S DEADLINE FOR THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF URGENT SUPPLIES A CONVOY REACHED THE TOWN OF DULL RAYER WHICH HAS BEEN SURROUNDED BY SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES FOR FOUR YEARS BUT WAS NOT CARRYING ANY FOOD RUSSIA SAID ITS ARRIVAL WAS A POSITIVE STEP THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN JOHN KIRBY SAID SYRIA HAD FAILED IN ITS OBLIGATIONS
CLEARLY IT SHOWS AT THE VERY LEAST I LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE CITIZENS HERE END AND A WILLINGNESS
SPIT IN THE FACE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO DO TO PUSH FOR THAT DELIVERY AUSTRALIAN POLICE WHO HELPED CAPTURE THE BRITISH PAEDOPHILE RICHARD HUCKLE HAVE IDENTIFIED OTHER U.K. NATIONALS USING THE SAME INTERNET SITES TO POST IMAGES OF CHILDREN HOW COOL IS FACING A LIFE SENTENCE AFTER ADMITTING SEVENTY ONE CHARGES ANGUS CRAWFORD REPORTS
HOW COOL SORT OUT FAMILIES IN THE SLUMS OF KUALA LUMPUR HE GAINED THEIR TRUST AND THEN SEXUALLY ABUSE THEIR CHILDREN
HE TOOK TENS OF THOUSANDS OF IMAGES AND VIDEOS AND POSTED THEM ON A SITE ON THE SO CALLED DARK WEBB HE WAS CAUGHT AFTER AUSTRALIAN POLICE INFILTRATED THE SITE FIND OUT WHO HE WAS AND TIPPED OFF THE U.K. AUTHORITIES B. NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE SAME UNIT IDENTIFIED OTHER BRITISH USERS DETAILS OF THOSE OFFENDERS WERE THEN PASSED ON TO BRITAIN'S NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY
B.B.C. NEWS HAS OBTAINED AN EXCLUSIVE INSIGHT INTO THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIR JOHN MAJOR WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER AND THE THEN U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SENIOR PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED RECORDS OF THEIR CORRESPONDENCE AND TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN LATES NINETEEN NINETY AND EARLY NINETEEN NINETY THREE REVEAL THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK
FOR OVER TWO YEARS THE B.B.C.'S FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SPECIALIST MARTIN ROSEN REQUESTED ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENTS FROM GEORGE BUSH SENIOR'S PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY THE RECORDS REVEAL THEY FREQUENTLY COMMISERATING WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT THE SLOG OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IT'S BEEN A MISERABLE FIVE MONTHS HERE CAMPAIGNING PRESIDENT BUSH LAMENTED IN MARCH NINETEEN NINETY TWO
IT'S BEEN MISERABLE HERE TO CONFIDED JOHN MAJOR ADDING THE CROWDS THAT HE'D MET ON THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN TRAIL WERE HORRENDOUS THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS SIR JOHN ADDED HAS BEEN BLOODY AND THE B.B.C. HAS BEEN APPALLING TOO
IN NOVEMBER NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE PRESIDENT'S INFORMED THE PRIME MINISTER I SENT YOU A LOVE LETTER YESTERDAY AND WONDERED IF IT HAD ARRIVED YEAH ADDED THAT SIR JOHN HAD BEEN VERY SWEET TO PRAISE HIM IN A RECENT SPEECH THE TWO LEADERS ARE RATHER LESS COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT THE VAN FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS MITTERRAND DESCRIBING HIM AS ILLOGICAL MIFFED AND GRUMPY
CHRIS MADE IT SOON REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK AT B.H.S. WORKED OF B.H.S. WILL KNOW MAYBE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM TO B. B. C. IS LEARNED THE DECISION IS LIKELY TODAY LUNCHTIME SIMON SIMON JACK A BUSINESS EDITOR YEAH HOPEFULLY BY LUNCHTIME JOHN WE SHOULD KNOW THERE'S ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW IF THERE IS ANOTHER CHAPTER TO BE WRITTEN IN THE EIGHTY EIGHT YEAR OLD
B.H.S. STORY OR WHETHER IT IS THE END OF THE ROAD THIS ADMINISTRATION PROCESS HAS GONE ON THE MORE PROTRACTED THAN ANYONE INCLUDING MYSELF EXPECTED IN THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE PEOPLE THE CONTENDERS TO BUY THIS SOME FAMILIAR FACES HAVE COME INTO THE FRAME AND THEN DRIFTED OUT WE'VE HAD
JOHN HA GREASY FOUNT OF MATALAN MIKE ASHLEY WAS IN THE FRAME AT ONE STAGE WE HAD THE POUNDSTRETCHER FAMILY ALL PEOPLE WITH CREDIBLE RETAILING EXPERTISE AND WELL KNOWN FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY HAVE MOVED ON BY WE'VE HAD OTHER PEOPLE COME INTO THE FRAME FOR EXAMPLE A PORTUGUESE FAMILY WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT FRONTED BY GREG TUFNELL THE BROTHER OF THE CRICKETER PHIL TUFNELL WHO HAS SOME RETAIL EXPERTISE HE WORKED HER MOTHER CAREFUL WELL BUT HE'S ALSO HAD A SLIGHTLY CHEQUERED HISTORY
IF NOT QUITE KNOWING MUCH ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FRONTED BY SOMEONE WITH A SLIGHTLY CHEQUERED PAST SOUNDS FAMILIAR YOU'LL KNOW WHY BECAUSE THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HAD HOWLIN PHILIP GREEN SULKED FOR DOMINIC SHAP HELL FOR ONE POUND IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ADMINISTRATORS ARE VERY KEEN NOT TO DO THAT OF COURSE IF THE BEST BID IS THERE ONE YOU KNOW LEAST ABOUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO A BIT MORE DIGGING AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GONE ON FOR SO LONG BUT WHAT OPTIONS FOR THIS
WELL YOU'VE GOTTA REMEMBER THE ADMINISTRATORS ARE WORKING FOR THE CREDITORS AND SAID THEY WERE ALTHOUGH THE JOBS ARE IMPORTANT IN A FIFTY FIFTY IT IS FIFTY FIFTY THEY WOULD GO FOR YOU COMPETING BIDS THEY'LL GO FOR SAVING THE JOBS BUT IF THOSE BITS AREN'T THE SAME BEAR FIGHT TISSUE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE CREDITORS SO THEY COULD IF THEY THINK IT'S WORTH SELLING STALL BY STALL BRICK BY BRICK TO LIQUIDATE THE VALUE AND GET MORE MONEY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THEY'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS OTHER BIT IS FOR REAL
AND WE DON'T KNOW YET OBVIOUSLY WEATHER WILL BE GOING TO WHAT IT IS IT'S ALL RATHER SECRET WE ARE WE ARE WE WE KNOW WE THINK THAT THIS IS A PORTUGUESE FAMILY FRONT WE DON'T THINK THAT I MEAN I DON'T I THINK THAT THAT IS THE DRESS I THINK THAT IS THAT IS THE BEST CONTEND THAT LEFT STANDING AT THE MOMENT BUT WE ARE TOLD THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUT SO THAT THERE COULD BE OTHERS I THINK THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT THIS THIS PROCESS
IS THAT BOTH PHILIP GREEN AND DOMINIC SHEP HELL WILL HAVE EVERYTHING CROSSED TODAY THAT SOME SORT OF DEAL CAN BE IN A SEWER PHILIP THE FIRST SOLD IN THE FIRST PLACE BOTH OF THOSE MEN WILL BE HOPING THAT A DEAL CAN BE DONE BECAUSE THAT WILL MAKE THE SEATS THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE OF COURSE THEY ARE BOTH FACING SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS BOTH NEXT WEEK AND THE WEEK AFTER
AND OF COURSE IF THAT THOSE HEARINGS TAKE PLACE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE WRECKAGE ELEVEN THOUSAND JOBS AND PENSIONERS WHO WILL LOSE OUT OF THE PENSIONERS WILL LOSE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS IT'S GONE TO THE PEOPLE
BUT IF THEY'RE DOING THAT WITH A BACKDROP OF A OF AN EMPIRE IN TATTERS THAT WILL BE A MUCH LESS COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE SO THEY'LL BE HOPING THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE ALTHOUGH EITHER WAY THEY'RE GOING TO GET A BIT OF A POUNDING OVER SUCH AN INCREDIBLE STORY WITH INCREDIBLE CAST OF CHARACTERS YOU'VE GOT SIR PHILIP GREEN OF COURSE BILLIONAIRE TYCOON YOU'VE GOT DOMINIC SHEP WHO MANAGED TO BUY A RATHER LARGE OTSU ENOUGH WELL IT'S GOT A COUPLE COUPLE THRICE AND ADD AN EXTRA ONE AND THREE TIMES BANKRUPT MOTOR RACING DRIVER YOU'VE NOW SEEN THAT THIS MOTOR RACING DRIVER DOMINIC SHEP HE'LL HAVE THE BACKING
OF THE FAMILY THE FAMOUS BLACK JACKED THE LOWER PROPERTY TYCOON YOU'VE GOT T. V. GREEN IN MONACO THE THE CHARACTERS COULD GET BUT IT'S WORTH A MINI SERIES ALL OF ITS OWN SADLY COULD BE BAD NEWS FOR FOR THE EMPLOYEES BUT ANYWAY WE LIVE IN HOPE WE SHOULD KNOW BY MUCH TIME SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU COULD HEAR HIM RIGHT IN THE NOVELS ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIRTY MINUTES
THIS IS NOT A CHILD IT BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE SOON AFTER TAKING THEIR NEW BORN BABY HOME THAT WAS THE STARTLING CONCLUSION REACHED BY MERCEDES CUS M. L. S. AND A BRITISH BORN HUSBAND RICH COSWORTH THEIR BABY HAD BEEN SWAPPED WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S IN A HOSPITAL IN EL SALVADOR THE PARENT SUSPECTED THEY'D BEEN VICTIMS ARE BABY TRAFFICKING
SOME EVEN ALLEGED THAT THEY'D BEEN COMPLICIT IN IT AFTER NINE LONG MONTHS THOUGH THE FAMILY THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR REAL BABY HAVE NOW GOT HOME REUNITED IN DALLAS WE'LL HEAR THEIR ACCOUNTS OF THEIR STORY AT TEN PAST EIGHT THE FIRST HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO BERNARD GARSIDE THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR WHO THEY CREDIT WITH REUNITING THE FAMILY
THE CASES ARE FREQUENTLY COMPLEX IN NATURE AND ALWAYS HAVE A HUMANITARIAN ANGLE I'M FROM A FAMILY PERSPECTIVE THIS HAS BEEN VERY VERY TOUGH THIS IS EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE SOLDER ON SYSTEM OFTEN SEEM JUST CONSPIRE AGAINST US
WITH THE HELP OF SUPREME COURT JUDGE AND SOME GOOD OLD FASHIONED DIPLOMACY WE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET LEVERAGE AND WE'VE GOT THE RESULT THAT WE WANTED IT IS DEEPLY REWARDING I'M VERY VERY PLEASED FOR THAT AND WHAT WAS CRITICAL IN THE END WAS D.N.A. EVIDENCE THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE HERE IS THAT BABIES HAVE FEET
PRINTED IT'S A BIT LIKE FINGERPRINTING BUT ITS FOOT PRINTING WHEN THEY ARE BORN AND THAT WAS A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE FOR BOTH OF THE BABIES IDENTITIES THAT WERE BOTH INVOLVED IN THIS CASE UNFORTUNATELY
NEITHER OF THOSE FOOTPRINTS WHICH WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THE BIRTH WERE CONCLUSIVE AND THE FACT THAT THE POLICE COULD NOT CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFY EITHER OF THE BABY AND SAY THEY WERE THE RIGHT BABIES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SWAPPED SO THEREFORE I ASKED THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE TO CONSIDER
THE EVIDENCE WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THROUGH D.N.A. WHICH SHE DID SHE TOOK THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND SO DID PLAY A CRUCIAL PART WELL THEY ARE GRATEFUL TO YOU JUST LISTEN FOR A SECOND TO WHAT RICHARD THE FATHER HAS BEEN SAYING
HE USED ALL HIS CONNECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY TO KEEP THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND WE HAD SOME BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIM
ARRANGING APPOINTMENTS FOR US ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE END HE WAS THERE IN THE FINAL DAY IN COURT HOW HE SET UP IN THE COURT WITH US ALL DAY JUST PUSHING AND PRESSURING TO GET IT DONE AND MY GARTSIDE WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR
RICHARD COSWORTH TALKING THERE WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER GARTSIDE WHEN HE FIRST CAME WITH HIS WIFE TO YOU DID YOU BELIEVE THE STORY DID YOU BELIEVE IT WAS RESOLVABLE WHEN WE FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN THE STORY IT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE I FIND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CONCERT CASES BEFORE
WHICH HAVE BEEN LESS COMPLEX AND HAVE NOT COME OUT THE SAME SORT OF WAY SO MY FEAR WAS THAT WE REALLY WEREN'T GOING TO SEE A HAPPY CONCLUSION TO THIS ONCE WE ESTABLISHED THAT BRUCE HAD BEEN
LATER APPEARED TO BE AN ELEMENTARY SWAP OR CHILDREN AND WERE ABLE TO VERY QUICKLY GET THE BIOLOGICAL CHILD BACK TO BOTH PARENTS
THAT WAS A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF FOR BOTH ME AND THE TEAM FROM THAT POINT ON WE THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT SIMPLER THAN WE THOUGHT
WASN'T QUITE AS SIMPLE AS THAT IT TOOK A LOT OF PULLING IN CONNECTIONS SPEAKING TO PEOPLE ASKING FAVOURS GETTING THINGS PUSHED THROUGH OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE AND THAT I THINK WAS ALSO VERY VERY REWARDING FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO USE GOOD OLD FASHIONED DIPLOMACY
TO FINALLY GET THE CASE TO COURT AND GET THE FINAL CONCLUSION THAT WE ACHIEVED ON THAT FRIDAY MORNING MANY MANY MANY MONTHS
EVEN AFTER IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE BABIES WERE WITH THE WRONG PARENTS
AND WERE SWAPPED IN ALL ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS YES SWAPPING THE BABIES BACK TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS WAS THE EASY BIT WHAT THEN TOOK A LOT OF TIME WAS UNRAVEL
THE LEGALITY OF ALL THE BIRTH CERTIFICATES THE FOOTPRINTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT PARENTS WERE RECORDED WITH THE RIGHT CHILDREN AND THAT TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE THE PRESSES HERE ARE QUITE LENGTHY AND THEY ARE SOMEWHAT OVERBURDENED AS WELL FINALLY YOU DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON WHERE CRIMINAL CHARGES MIGHT END UP IF THEY END UP ANYWHERE BUT IS THERE STILL A LONG WAY FOR THIS SAGA TO RUN
FROM ONE END STAND ACTUALLY THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO CRIMINAL ELEMENT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THIS AND IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'M NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED IN ANY SPECULATION ON BUT I'M JUST VERY VERY PLEASED FOR THE COURSE WORKS THAT THEY ARE NOW ALTOGETHER THEY ARE BACK IN THE U.S. WHERE THEY FIRST STARTED
AND THAT THEY CAN START REBUILDING OUR LIVES TO GO AND IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PLAY A PART IN SOME WAY THEN FOR ME IT MAKES MY JOB WORTHWHILE
THE GIRLS AREN'T BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO EL SALVADOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ON THERE ARE GROWING SIGNS THAT INVESTORS ARE WORRYING HER POSSIBLE WRECKS IT
THIS MORNING'S BUSINESS NEWS FROM ROB YES WITH THE REFERENDUM ON OUR MEMBERSHIP JUST WEEKS AWAY INVESTORS ARE WATCHING A RELATIVELY OBSCURE PART OF THE FINANCIAL WORLD FOR MARKET FOR STERLING OPTIONS THIS LOOKS NOT AT THE VALUE OF THE POUND FROM ONE MINUTE TO THE NEXT BUT HOW MUCH IT MIGHT BE WORTH IN FEATURE IN THIS CASE THE DAY AFTER THE REFERENDUM THE COST OF PROTECTING AGAINST SWINGS IN THE VALUE OF THE POUND OVER THE NEXT MONTH HAS JUMPED TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE JUST AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WILL WITH US IS PIPPA MUM FOUND OF THE D. R. P. M. GROUP FORMER
CURRENCY STRATEGIST WHO ALSO WAS ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH GOOD MORNING MORNING PERHAPS A BIT OF SIMPLE EXPLANATION FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS THE STIRLING OPTIONS MARKET WELL IT'S A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN MAKE A BET AND WHY YOU THINK THE CURRENCY WILL BE WORTH IN THE FUTURE AND YOU PICK A DATE THAT YOU LIKE AND THEN YOU PLACE YOUR BET AND WHAT BETS ARE BEING PLACE WHAT IT WHAT DOES THIS MARKET TELLING US ABOUT WHAT TRADERS ARE EXPECTING WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE REFEREE WELL WEATHERED SAYING AS THEY FEAR THERE A RISK OF A BRECHT IS RISING
WHICH IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE POLES COMING OUT SAYING THAT MORE THAN FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC ARE LEANING IN THIS DIRECTION OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INTRODUCES SOME UNCERTAINTY SO THE MARKETERS TO AS THEY SAY IN THE MARKET PRICE THAT MEANS YOU KNOW COS DRILLING TO FALL A LITTLE BIT
BUT FRANKLY YOUR CURRENCIES ARE ALWAYS HER TO WEAR THAT AND SO WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE E.U. AS WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE POLLS ARE SHOWING MORE IN HALF ITALIANS ARE SAYING THAT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU ANY MORE EITHER SO THAT WILL ALSO AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE EURO VERSUS STIRLING AND IS THE VALUE OF THE POUND VERSUS THE DOLLAR ESSENTIALLY FOOT TRACKING THE OPINION POLLS
WELL NO BECAUSE ALSO THIS MONTH WE HAVE THE BIG FEDERAL RESERVE MEANING THAT'S THE AMERICAN CENTRAL BANK
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MAY RAISE INTEREST RATE AND IF THAT HAPPENS NATURALLY U.S. DOLLAR INCREASES IN VALUE AND STERLING FALLS BUT HERE THE MEDIA MAY SAY OH WELL IT'S FINE BECAUSE A BREAD IS IT MIGHT AFFECT THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE DRIVER THERE MANY MANY FACTORS THAT PLAY ON CURRENCIES THAT SO WE WERE PART OF THE REASON BUT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT US THEN THAT'S ANOTHER COST VOLATILITY PROTECTION AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE JUST AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT SOUNDS QUITE DRAMATIC
IT DOES SOUND DRAMATIC BUT IT'S IT'S A NORMAL FUNCTION OF THE INSURANCE MARKET IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY SO YES THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY BUT THAT'S THAT'S COMMENSURATE WITH THE FACT THE PAWS ARE PRETTY TIGHT AND ALSO WE HAVEN'T HEARD AN EXIT FROM THE E.U. WERE OF PEOPLE REALLY DON'T KNOW PRACTICALLY HOWARD WERE
YOU SAID BEFORE INVESTORS FEAR A BRITISH EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION PRESUMABLY THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE ALSO LOOKING TO MAKE MONEY I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE QUITE A FEW INVESTORS WHO THINK THAT BRITAIN'S ECONOMY WILL BE FAR BETTER OFF OUT I HAPPENED TO FALL INTO THAT COUNT MYSELF BUT IT'S ALWAYS A TWO WAY BACK RIGHT SOMETHING NEGATIVE AND SOMETHING PASSED O.K. THANK YOU PIPPA BUT HER MUM CAN THEN FROM THE D. R. P. M. GRIP
THANKS ROB IT IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF VICARS AND AN AWFUL LOT OF CLERGY IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND ARE REACHING RETIREMENT AGE AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH YOUNGER ONES TO REPLACE THEM WELL I'M JOINED BY SOMEBODY WHO IS SORT OF REACHING RETIREMENT AGE BUT SHE'S NOT THERE YET YEAH WELL I DON'T KNOW LOOK AT IT I KNEW YOU DO THAT LIKE THAT SO I APOLOGISE IMMEDIATELY I SHOULD THINK SO CHRIS YOU'RE FIFTY FIVE IS THAT RIGHT I SHOULDN'T GIVE AWAY HIS STUDENTS A LADIES ONLY
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE AND I BECAUSE THAT WOULD HELP THEM THEN THEY ARE VERY YOUNG FIFTY VERY YOU LOOK ABOUT TWENTY TO ME WHEN HE CAME IN ANYWAY YOU ARE THE RHYTHM IN FRONT ROSE AT SAINT WILL ANDY A CHAPLAIN TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND CHAPLAIN TO THE QUEEN WHICH IS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED THE LINE BY PETER OLD DIP IDIOT YOUR CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIEST BUT NOT REALLY A PRIEST AS IT WERE WELL I AM I REALLY A PRIEST I'M EH VERY YOUTHFUL FORTY TWO
I WORK IN THE BANKING SECTOR BUT I'M ALSO ATTACHED TO A CHURCH HERE IN CANTERBURY RIGHT BUT BUT BUT NOT A VICAR AS SUCH NOT A NOT NOT FORMALLY A VICAR BUT I DO ALL THE VICARAGE STUFF RIGHT O.K. AND YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL THE NUMBER CRUNCHING AND YOU COME UP WITH THIS RATHER WORRYING STATISTIC SO ROSE I HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR OBVIOUSLY AS A VERY YOUNG FIFTY FIVE ARE YOU PLANNING TO STAY ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME
I'VE GOT GREAT HEALTH AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY THERE IS THAT AND THERE'S NO BAR ON PRICKLY WELL I'VE GOT THAT'S WHAT I'D HAVE THOUGHT AND ANYWAY LEGALLY YOU CAN STADIUM LEICAS AND HER RETIREMENT AGE ANY LONGER WHY ARE SO MANY NOT STAYING DO YOU THINK
WELL PERHAPS THEY HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE THEY FEEL THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO TO TO GO OH I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME BEING GATEKEEPERS AND WE'VE SEEN A CHURCH THAT HAS BEEN VERY CLERICAL LIES VERY MALE AND VERY WHITE VERY MIDDLE CLASS AND WE'RE ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
REALISING AND RECOGNISING THAT IF WE IF WE CAN'T ACTUALLY EXIST LIKE THIS AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE AND SO WHAT WE DO SEE NOW ARE MUCH MORE PARTNERSHIPS IN TERMS OF CHURCHES WORKING TOGETHER WE SEE DIFFERENT STYLES OF MINISTRIES BEING EXERCISE AND I I'M VERY HOPEFUL I DON'T FEEL DOWN IN THE DUMPS BECAUSE A FEW PEOPLE ARE A RETIREE RIGHT SO THE IDEA THAT
WELL ACTUALLY BEFORE I ASK YOU THAT LET ME JUST GET A SENSE FROM PETER OF HOW SERIOUS IT IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE OLD ONES RETIRING THERE NOT BEING ENOUGH YOUNGSTERS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE STATS TELL US I MEAN ARE THEY GONNA RUN OUT OF BECAUSE
WHILE WE WON'T RUN OUT OF VICARS BUT WILL BE A BIT SHORT ON THE GROUND THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF CLERGY GOING TO BE RETIRING IN THE IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE OF THE OF THE COUNTRY THAT FIGURE GOES UP TO ALMOST FORTY
FOR SCENT AND THEY JUST SIMPLY AREN'T THE CLERGY COMING IN AT THE BOTTOM END AS IT WERE TO FILL ALL THE PLACES WE'VE WE'VE HAD AMAZING RECRUITMENT NUMBERS ORDER NATIONS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT IT'S EVEN THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO FILL ALL THE GAPS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING FROM AROUND EIGHT THOUSAND FULL TIME
STIPEND THAT CLERGY DOWN TO AROUND SEVEN SEVEN THOUSAND WITHIN FIFTEEN OR SO YEARS EVEN ME IF WE CARRY ON WITH THE CURRENT HIGH LEVELS OF RECRUITMENT SO THAT'S A REAL ISSUE IN IN IN IN TERMS OF A RUNNING THE CHURCH ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS RIGHT PUT THAT ON YOUR BACON ROSES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT OLD PICTURE OF THE LEFT THE SLIGHTLY AGEING THIS WHITE AND MALE RUNNING HIS
THAT'S GONE REALLY ALWAYS GOING IT IS GOING AND I THINK INSTEAD OF PANICKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS LOOKING AT THE KIND OF MINISTRY THAT WE SHOULD BE DEVELOPING WE ALSO OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT HOW WE MIGHT ENCOURAGE THE TYPE OF CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP THAT WILL ENABLE MORE PEOPLE TO COME FOR WOMEN DID DECIDE SOMEONE ONCE SAID THAT CHRISTIANITY ISN'T TAUGHT IT IS CAUGHT AND THERE IS SO MUCH TRUTH IN THAT
IF YOU HAVE INSPIRATIONAL PEOPLE LEADING THEN THE OTHERS WILL CATCH ON LOLL EASIER SAID THAN DONE WELL TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE WE ALSO NEED TO BE GOING INTO SCHOOLS WHEN WE HAVE THE SCHOOL CAREER DAYS WE WE NEED TO BE FAIR TRUE SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER YOU COULD SAIL WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE A VEHICLE AND HE ASKED MY ALONG WELL ACTUALLY I DID I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY I GO INTO A LOT OF SCHOOLS AND TO TAKE SERVICES OR ASSEMBLIES OR TO SPEAK
FOR SPEECH GAZA TETRA AND UP FINDING A VERY VERY POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FIRST OF ALL DIDN'T KNOW THAT WOMEN COULD MOORO LOAD EXACTLY AND ALSO THAT YOU BE BLACK AS WELL EXACTLY EXACTLY SO THEY SAY YOU WHO ARE BOTH MM IT IS POSSIBLE IT'S POSSIBLE IT IS POSSIBLE SO THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS OF THE CHURCH
IT IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY IT IS TO DOESN'T IT NO CHUCK IT IS CHANGING AND I THINK WHAT WE WANT ARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN LEADERSHIP TO ACTUALLY RECOGNISE AND I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY I THINK OUR BISHOPS ARE RECOGNISING MAYBE I DON'T THAN A BISHOP BUT I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T BE ALONE THAT EVEN I THOUGHT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN OUR LIFETIME ACCURATE MIRROR ROSE HAD KITTENS WILL'S WILKIN DID IT OLD THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED
PLENTY YOU TARGET A LIFETIME NOR RETIRING FOR A LONG TIME TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN GARY'S HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS MORNING TOP MAULING STORIES INCLUDE THE STORY THAT TROON THE VENUE FOR THIS YEAR'S OPEN GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP IS TO HOLD A VOTE AT THE START OF NEXT MONTH ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ADMIT WOMEN MEMBERS TROON IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY REMAINING COURSE ON THEIR MIND STRONG OPEN ROTA TO HAVE A MALE ONLY MEMBERSHIP POLICY

TWENTY BLAST OR WINS FOR DURHAM ESSEX AND SUSSEX YORKSHIRE LANCASHIRE THEY'RE NOW LEVEL ON POINTS WITH THEM AT THE TOP OF THE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE PLAY PORTUGAL THIS EVENING IN THEIR FINAL WARM UP GOING BEFORE THE START OF THIS MONTH'S EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS THE STARTING ELEVEN TONIGHT MAYBE A GUIDE TO WHO MANAGER ROY HODGSON WILL SELECT FOR ENGLAND'S OPENING GAME A WEEK ON SATURDAY
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD MARCUS RASH ASHFORD IN THE SQUAD ARE REPORTS THIS WEEK SUGGEST HE'S ABOUT TO SIGN A NEW CONTRACT AT MANCHESTER UNITED WORTH AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A WEEK IT'S BEEN REVEALED THIS MORNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE WAGE BILL HAS RIVERS ABOVE TWO BILLION POUNDS THE FIGURES ARE PUBLISHED IN THE DE LLOYD TO REVIEW A FOOTBALL FINANCE AND DIANE JONES FROM TO LOITER IS HERE DONE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING THE WAGE BILL OVER TO MILLIE DO TWO BILLION POUNDS THAT THAT'S THE COMBINED TOTAL OF WHAT THE PLAYERS IN SPAIN AND ITALY PEPPER PEPPER PAID TOGETHER ISN'T IT
IT IS WHAT IT REFLECTS IS THERE THAN THE PREMIER LEAGUE NOW HAS IN TERMS OF ITS HIS FINANCIAL SCALE SO THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS NOW HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ANY LAKE IN THE WORLD AND INTERNS ITS FINANCES AND OF COURSE THE KEY COST ITEM FOR ANY PREMIER LEAGUE CLUB IS HIS PLAYERS AND THE REASON THEY CAN DO IT HE'S THE NEW T. T. V. DEAL WHICH IS WORSE
SO THE NEW T. V. DEAL PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE SCALE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING ON YOUR VIEW IS THE LAST YEAR BEFORE THE PREMIER LEAGUE ALL THE CLUBS COMBINED SHARED FIFTEEN MILLION TELEVISION REVENUE THIS SEASON WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO BY HALF TIME
IN THE SECOND LIVE TELEVISED GAME SO ONE HALF GAMES INTO THE SEASON THAT NUMBER OF THEIR MATCH THAT'S TEN MILLION POUNDS A GAME NOW HE WAS FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS A SEASON FOR THE PREMIER LEAGUE STARTED SO IF IT'S TEN MILLION POUNDS A GAME POINT TO TICKET PRICES NEED TO BE SO MUCH HAD BEEN A LOT OF CLUBS HAVE REDUCED SOME CLUBS ADMIRABLY HAVE ARRANGED AND SUBSIDISE AWAY TRAVEL BUT WHY CAN THEY NOT BRING TICKET PRICES DOWN TO SAY TWENTY FIVE QUID
I THINK WITH TICKET PRICES YOU'VE GOT REMEMBER THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT'S GONE INTO THE STADIUMS AS WELL SO THIS YEAR AGAIN RECORD INVESTMENT THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS SPENT THIS IS BEFORE TOTTENHAM REDEVELOP THEIR STAY IN CHELSEA REDEVELOP THEIR STADIUM AND THE CLUBS ARE VERY CONSCIOUS THIS IS A VERY HIGH PROFILE ISSUE BUT PRICES HAVE MOVED UP VERY MUCH AT ALL IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR SO AND THE GROUNDS ARE SORT OF NINETY FIVE NINETY SIX PERCENT FULL ON AVERAGE SO
THE CLUBS TO CONTINUE WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S T. V. ALL TICKETS BUT OF COURSE THE MATCH DAY CROWD IS SO IMPORTANT TO T. V. BECAUSE IF YOU TURN ON YOUR T.V. IN THE GROUNDS HALF EMPTY IN THIS MODEL OF ATMOSPHERE IT'S NO GOOD IF IT'S FULL
WITH PEOPLE OF PASSION ABOUT THE GAME THAN THAT'S WHAT T. V. WANTS TO SEE AS WELL VERY QUICK FINAL THOUGHT FRONT PAGE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES TODAY THE HEADLINE TOP FOOTBALL TEAMS RISING PROFIT SET TO ATTRACT BUYERS YO ALL CLUBS HAVE A PRICE IF YOU WANTED TO BUY MAN UNITED WHAT WOULD IT COST THIS MORNING I THOUGHT WELL INTO THE BILLIONS FOR A FOR A MANCHESTER UNITED BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THINGS HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED BECAUSE
FOR TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN REVENUE GROWING FAST BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PROFIT SO IT'S BEEN A A VANITY OR TROPHY PURCHASE NOW THE STONES MAKE SENSE THE FINANCIAL PURCHASE AT DONE JONES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE BIG MONEY ON OFFER THE SELECTIONS RUN AT LINGFIELD TO TURN NUMBER SEVEN MONEY OR YOUR LIFE APPROPRIATELY RIPON FOR TWENTY NUMBER BEFORE SECRET HORSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED GARY THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRAVEL BACK TO JUNE THE SECOND NINETEEN SIXTY
WORLD WAR ONE ON THE B.B.C. WILL LOOK AT IT
THERE ARE NO ROADS IN THE SOMME AREA THAT CAN TAKE MILITARY TRAFFIC SO THEY'RE BRINGING STONE OVER FROM CORNWALL AND PREPARATION IN DEPTH STORIES FROM THE WESTERN FRONT BASED ON EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS THE OFFICERS THINK IT WILL WORK
THE LADS THINK IT'LL WORK
I THINK IT'LL WORK A REAL DAY AT WAR EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
TOMMY'S THIS AFTERNOON AT TWO FIFTEEN ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR
LOOK AT THE WEATHER NAIL A LARGELY DRY IT'S BRIGHTER IN THE WEST AND IT IS RATHER CLOUDIER AND WETTER IN THE EAST YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE TIME TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM THE EN SUITE THE NEW LEADER OF THE G. M. B. UNION TIM ROACH HAS WARNED THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN COULD LOSE THE E.U. REFERENDUM UNLESS LABOUR VOTE HAS BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN THE DEBATE
IN A B.B.C. INTERVIEW HE URGES THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN TO DO MORE TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE UNION AND HE SAYS LABOUR MUST EASE VOTERS FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE PROMINENT VOTE TO LEAVE CAMPAIGNER HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET AND THERE REMAIN CAMP HAVE SHOWN CONTEMPT FOR VOTERS ON IMMIGRATION HE SAID DAVID CAMERON NEEDED TO SET OUT HOW HE PLANNED TO EASE PRESSURES ON THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS AND HOUSING
GEORGE OSBORNE AND THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HAVE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER TO VOTE TO LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ACCUSING THEM OF COMING UP WITH UN COSTED AND UNWORKABLE PROPOSALS AND CHALLENGING THEM TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING UP POLICIES AS THEY GO ALONG THE PROMINENT EXIT CAMPAIGNER MICHAEL GO VERS DESCRIBED SUGGESTIONS FROM THE REMAIN CAMP THAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HIT TRADE AS ABSURD
A COUPLE WHO WERE GIVEN THE WRONG BABY BY HOSPITAL IN EL SALVADOR A YEAR AGO HER FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED TO TRAVEL HOME TO THE UNITED STATES WITH THEIR SON THEIR CHILDREN WERE HANDED BACK TO THEIR REAL PARENTS EIGHT MONTHS AGO BUT RICH COSH WORTH WHO'S BRITISH AND HIS WIFE MERCY WERE ONLY GIVEN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR THEIR SON MOSES A FEW DAYS AGO A DECISION ON THE FUTURE OF THE HIGH STREET RETAILER B.H.S. IS EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY THE FIRM WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION IN APRIL JUST A YEAR AFTER IT WAS SOLD BY SIR PHILIP GREEN FOR ONE POUND
BRITAIN FRANCE AND AMERICA HAVE CALLED ON THE UN TO BEGIN AIR DROPS OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO BESIEGED AREAS IN SYRIA THEY SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT OUTSIDE HAD FAILED TO RESPECT YESTERDAY'S DEADLINE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLIES THE CONVOY REACHED THE TOWN OF DOUNREAY WHICH HAS BEEN SURROUNDED BY SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES FOR FOUR YEARS BUT WAS NOT CARRYING ANY FOOD RUSSIA SAID ITS ARRIVAL WAS A POSITIVE STEP
IT IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT BRITAIN WILL VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION UNLESS LABOUR VOTERS GET MORE INVOLVED IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT'S THE WARNING TO JEREMY CORBIN FROM A LEADING FIGURE IN THE PARTY MY MAKING A SPEECH OR THE REMAIN CAMP TODAY BUT HIS CRITICS SAY WE HAVEN'T SEEN ENOUGH OF HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN TIM ROPES OF GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE G.M. SAYS HE MUST DO MORE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U.
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT LABOUR VOTERS WILL STAY AT HOME I THINK THEY WON'T SEE IT AS THE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL VOTE THAT IT IS NOW SO I THINK THAT THEY SEE IT AS A BUN FIGHT IN THE TORY PARTY
LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DECISIONS ANY OF US WILL MAKE FOR A GENERATION
WELL OWEN SMITH IS THE SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING JOHN IS HE RIGHT
I THINK HE IS RIGHT TIM KNOWS THAT WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A LABOUR CASE IT'S GOING TO BE A STRONG A DISTINCT LABOUR CASE THERE IS A DANGER OBVIOUSLY THAT LABOUR VOTERS WILL SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THE TORIES BEEN BANGING ON ABOUT FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND NOT SOMETHING THAT BOTHERS AND JEREMY AGREES WITH HIM WHICH IS WHY HE'S MAKING A REALLY BIG SPEECH TODAY A THIRD OR FOURTH BIG SPEECHES MADE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND HE'S MAKING A VERY CLEAR LABOUR CASE HE'S SAYING THAT
WE'VE GOT A SERIES OF WORKERS' RIGHTS THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR BEING MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN YOU'D INTERACT IS BACKSTOP TO SUPPORT THOSE RIGHTS AND CRUCIALLY IF WE SAW OUR ECONOMY CRUSHES EVERYBODY I THINK AGREES WOULD HAPPEN IF WE LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BAD FOR WORKERS YOU IS THIRD OR FOURTH SPEECH DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR QUITE A LONG TIME THOUGH HASN'T IT WE'VE SEE LEADERS OF THE
LEAVE CAMPAIGN ALL OVER THE PLACE CAR PICK UP A PAPER CAN'T TURN ON A BULLETIN WITHOUT HEARING FROM THEM WE HAVE HEARD VERY VERY LITTLE FROM MY COLD IN THAT THE REALITY ISN'T IT WELL I THINK THAT'S A REFLECTION MORE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE PRESS HAS BEEN REPORTING THIS IS A BLUE ON BLUE TORY INTERNAL HIM AND TIM SAID COME IN BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY AS IT FELT IT I THINK IT IS
I THINK IT'S LARGELY THE STORY TO BE HONEST JOHN I THINK THE TRUTH IS AS I SAID PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEEN THE TORIES BANGING ON ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND LABOUR IS HAVING TO WORK DOUBLY HARD TO MAKE OUR VOICE BUT ALAN JOHNSON AND LOTS OF US HAVE BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING EVERY DAY JEREMY'S BEEN OUT CAMPAIGNING DID IN CARDIFF TOMORROW CAMPAIGNING ON THIS ISSUE IS MAKING A BIG SPEECH TODAY ON IT
AND AS I SAY I THINK HE IS RECOGNISING THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A STRONG LABOUR CASE THE CRUCIAL CASE IS THE ECONOMIC ONE AS I SAY WE'VE GOT THIS VERY REAL RISK THAT EVERYBODY THE O.E.C.D. THE I.M.F. THE C.B.I. EVERYBODY SAYS IS THERE IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL SEE OUR ECONOMY
DECLINE ALREADY THIS MORNING THERE ARE WORRIES THAT GROWTH THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE REDUCED THIS IS THAT WHAT SHE WAS MEANT TO BE AT BECAUSE OF THE FEARS ABOUT THE PROTECT PROSPECT BELIEVING EUROPEAN UNIT AND I THINK THAT A MYRIAD OTHER EXAMPLES WE CAN POINT TO PAID HOLIDAY
WORKERS' RIGHTS IT FULL OR PART TIME WORKERS MATERNITY PAY YOU LOTS OF THESE THINGS ARE SUPPORTED BY A BEING PART OF THE EUROPEAN O.K. COME BACK TO THAT IN A MINUTE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER INTERPRETATION ISN'T THERE OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE SO CALLED BLUE ON BLUE DIMENSION THAT IS THAT MY CORBIN IS PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT BACK YES HE'S MADE A FEW BIG SPEAKERS AS YOU SAID BUT HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SIT BACK AND WATCH THE TORIES TEARING THEMSELVES APART BECAUSE IN
BRUTE POLITICAL TERMS THAT'S NOT DOING HERE AND THE LABOUR PARTY ANY HARM AT ALL OH I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT AT ALL JOHN I THINK ALL OF US IN THE LABOUR PARTY FEEL THAT WE'VE GOT A ROTTEN TORY GOVERNMENT CHEER AND THE ONLY PLAN THIS IS WHY WE'RE GETTING RID OF THEM THEY KNOW THE ONLY WELL LOOK AT THE MOST LIKE WE DON'T GET RID OF THE TORY GOVERNMENT IF WE GO TO EUROPE WE DO DESTROY DAVID CAMERON THE EFFECTS OF THAT COULD BE THE TORY PARTY
TEARING IT UP BUT WE END UP POTENTIALLY WE SEND THE EVEN WORSE WE END UP WITH BORIS JOHNSON OR PRETTY PATEL OR IAIN DUNCAN SMITH ONE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT IT ABSOLUTELY SHRED WORKERS' RIGHTS IN THIS IS IT A BIT GLIB BUT PARTLY ON THE PART OF THE PROGRAMME SAYING
GOOD ON YOU DAVID CAMERON WE WANT TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR JOB WELL I'M NO GREAT FAMILY DAVID CAMERON BUT I TELL YOU WHAT HE'S NOT THE WORST OF THE TORIES ARE SOME OF THE MORE ABSOLUTE STEAL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT THE REALITY IS LOOK WE DON'T HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION A NEW GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT OF US LEAVING EUROPE IS PERFECTLY PLAUSIBLE THE TORIES JUST HANG ON BUT THEY END UP WITH A DIFFERENT LEADER OF THE TORY PARTY COULD BE EVEN WORSE
EVEN MORE LIKELY IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A TORY GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF NEGOTIATING THE DEAL THAT BRITAIN DOES AFTER EXIT AND I FEAR GIVE IT ALL THAT THEY SAID OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS PRETTY PATEL TALKING ABOUT BRITISH WORKERS BEING IDLERS OR TALKING ABOUT US NEEDING TO
GET RID OF THE BURGEONING ON BRITISH BUSINESSES IN A BIRD AND WHEN THEY SAY THAT WHEN THEY SAY RED TAPE WE KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN OUR REGULATIONS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF BRITISH WORKERS THEY WOULD SELL THOSE THINGS DOWN THE RIVER JOHN IF THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF ORGANISING AN EXIT AND THAT IS WHY LABOUR'S GOT TO MAKE AN INCREDIBLY STRONG CASE AND I WILL BE URGING JEREMY COULD REDOUBLE HIS EFFORTS BUT I KNOW I DON'T WANT TO COS HE UNDERSTANDS WE ALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS WELL REDOUBLE HIS EFFORTS ARE HER HER MAYBE BUT
IF HE WERE TO STAND ALONGSIDE DAVID CAMERON ON A PLATFORM THAT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE WOULDN'T IT BUT HE CAN'T DO THAT OR AT LEAST HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT AND WHEN WE SAW SAID HE KHAN STANDING ALONGSIDE DAVID CAMERON ON A PLATFORM HE WAS ATTACKED FOR IT BUT I MISS HIM AT ALL THEM THE PEOPLE WELL I'LL BE HONEST JOHN I THINK THAT'S AGAIN A BIT OF A SORT OF MEDIA SIDESHOW SHOULD WE SHOULDN'T WE COME ON FULL IMAGES THAT THE LEADERS OF THE TWO MAIN PARTIES IN THIS COUNTRY STANDING SIDE BY SIDE SAYING
VOTE TO STAY IN EUROPE THAT'S A POWERFUL IMAGE AND IT'S A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD ISN'T IT BECAUSE SOME LABOUR VOTERS WILL NO DOUBT LOOK AT THAT AND SEE WINE IS JEREMY CORBIN OF ALL PEOPLE STANDING ALONGSIDE THE TORIES WE WANT TO CURE A STRONG LABOUR BECAUSE IT'S MORALLY THAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ISN'T IT BECAUSE NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER STAYING IN EUROPE AND I AM NOT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE AND I THINK YOU DID AND I AM NOT CONVINCED AND I DON'T THINK JEREMY IS CONVINCED THAT WE STRENGTHEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF THOSE NINE MILLION LABOUR VOTERS
BY CAMPAIGNING ALONGSIDE THE TORIES YES WE'RE BOTH MAKING AN ARGUMENT TO STAY IN THE LABOUR PARTY IS COMPLETELY UNITED IN MAKING THAT ARGUMENT UNLIKE THE TORIES WHO WERE RIVEN DOWN THE MIDDLE BUT LABOUR IS SAYING WE NEED TO MAKE A LABOUR ARGUMENT AND WE'RE DOING THAT TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHOOSING THE VISITORS HANG ON THEY'LL SAY I DON'T NEED ANOTHER LABOUR I GIVE UP THIS IS THE TORY ARGUMENT SURELY THERE IS ONE ARGUMENT THE VAT IS STAY IN EUROPE
I THINK THE TORIES SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF OUR STAYING WITHIN EUROPE THEY SEE THE VALUE OF FREE TRADE ARE BEING PART OF THE SINGLE MARKET THEY SEE ALL OF THOSE THINGS I DON'T THINK THEY ARE AS CONVINCED AS WE ARE I DON'T THINK THEY BELIEVE US WE BELIEVE THAT EUROPE IS AN IMPORTANT BACKSTOP FOR SOCIAL AND EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AND THEREFORE THERE IS A DISTINCT LABOUR CASE TO BE MADE THAT OUR VOTERS I THINK
PEOPLE ARE CONFUSING UNTRUE THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S THE DANGER THAT YOU FACE YOU END UP CONFUSING THE VOTE AND THEY WANT A NICE A LOT OF PEOPLE ANYWAY WHAT A NICE SIMPLE METHOD MESSAGE INTO SEE LABOUR AND TORIES STANDING SIDE BY SIDE WOULD DELIVER THAT FOR THEM WELL WHEN WE GIVE IT TO YOU NOW JOHN AND YOU CAN TRANSLATE IT TO THE NATION LABOUR UNIFORMLY ALL ACROSS THE BOARD BELIEVES WE SHOULD BE STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR JOBS FOR THE ECONOMY FOR SECURITY FOR PEACE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE TO DO WITH TAX AVOIDANCE
HALF OF THE TORY PARTY BELIEVES THE SAME AND THAT HALF WITH THE TORY SHE WANTS DAD NOT THE PRATFALL WITH AFTER THAT PARTY WELL AND ACUMEN STANDING ON PLATFORM VITTORIO FOR JOHN AS WELL YOU KNOW WHO OWNS THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS A LOT
IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS THE GUARDIAN LEADS ON THAT INTERVENTION BY THE NEW G. M. BE LEADER THE PAPER'S EDITORIAL ACCUSES THE SIDE ARE PROMOTING PUBLIC ANXIETY ABOUT UNRESTRICTED E.U. MIGRATION BUT SUGGESTS THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN ON A LARGELY CONSERVATIVE TONE THE PAPER BELIEVE LABOUR ISN'T PULLING ITS WEIGHT SAYING TOO MANY POLITICIANS FROM JEREMY CORBIN DOWN SEEM READY TO SIT ON THEIR HANDS
AND TIMES MEANTIME CALLS ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE THE MERITS OF MIGRATION SAYING THE FREE THROW OF LABOUR THE FREE FLOW OF LABOUR I'M SORRY IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY THE MAIN STORY IN THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MICHAEL GO HAS CLAIMED THAT AS JUST A SECRETARY HERE HAS BEEN FORCED TO ALLOW TERROR SUSPECTS INTO BRITAIN BECAUSE E.U. RULES LEFT HIM POWERLESS TO INTERVENE TELEGRAPHS HIS COMMENTS WILL INTENSIFIED THE DEBATE ABOUT BRITAIN'S POROUS BORDERS AS THE HOME OFFICE FACES CRITICISM FOR LAX SECURITY
WHICH IS ALLOWING SMUGGLERS TO BRING IN MIGRANTS BY SEA THE SUN COMMENTS THAT THE WAY BRITAIN DEFENDS ITS COASTLINE IS A FORCE WITH THREE SUBSTANDARD BORDER FORCE BOATS RELYING ON WHAT IT CALLS A DAD'S ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS AT LOOKOUT POSTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE DAILY MAIL'S FROM PAGE PICTURES AN INFLATABLE BOAT SEIZED BY KENT POLICE AFTER ALLEGEDLY BEING USED IN A MIGRANT SMUGGLING OPERATION AT THE WEEKEND THE BABIES AS THEIR CRAFT HAVE BEEN BOTANY BAY FULL DAYS FOR THREE THOUSAND POUNDS IN
THE TIMES REPORTS FROM IRAQ ON TERRIBLE CONDITIONS IN THE CITY OF FALLUJAH IN IRAQ WHERE GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE CARRYING OUT A MAJOR OFFENSIVE AGAINST ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS THE TIME SAYS THE JIHADISTS HAVE BEEN PRESS GANGING BOYS AS YOUNG AS TWELVE TO FIGHT FOR THEM IT SAYS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY ENDURED TWO YEARS OF STARVATION ONE U.N. OFFICIAL SO SOME FAMILIES ARE SO DESPERATE THEY HAVE ABANDONED CHILDREN THEY CANNOT CAREFUL
THE TELEGRAPH REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF A STUDY SUGGESTING THAT MEN WITH BIGGER WAIST SIZES HAVE A GREATER RISK OF CONTRACTING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FORM OF PROSTRATE CANCER OR PAPERS ARE SEVERAL FORMS OF CANCER ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO A BEE SETTEE BUT THE NEW RESEARCH BY OXFORD UNIVERSITY
THAT WEIGHT ON THE WAIST HAS A SPECIFIC IMPACT ON PROSTATE CANCER SHARPLY INCREASING THE RISK OF A FATAL FORM OF THE DISEASE AND AFTER THE NEWS AT MARKS AND SPENCER'S GOING TO STOP USING PIPED MUSIC INNIT SHOPS THE TIMES REPORTS THAT RESTAURANTS ARE ABOUT TO BECOME THE FIRST LINE OF THE BATTLE AGAINST CANNED MUSIC THE PAPER SAYS CAMPAIGN GROUPS ARE MAKING A JOINT APPEAL TO RESTAURANTS CAFES AND PUBS TO TONE DOWN THE NOISE ONE CAMPAIGNERS HAS PEOPLE WITH HEARING LOSS
ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO GET A CONVERSATION OTHERS TAKE THEIR MUSIC AS OPPRESSIVE AND RUINS THE EXPERIENCE FOR DINA'S TIME NOW IS SIXTY MINUTES TO EIGHT AND TALKING OF NOISE AND SOUND AND ALL THAT HERE IS A TEST FOR YOU TRY SPOTTING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO CELLS THIS ONE
AND THIS ONE
THAT ONE WAS PRETTY EASY IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A WAR MOVIE THE SOUND OF A STUKA DIVE BOMBERS ATTACKED ITS TARGETS IN WORLD WAR TWO BUT THE FIRST GOES BACK A BIT FURTHER TWO THOUSAND YEARS EARLIER IN FACT IT WAS THE SOUND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE STONES THE ROMANS HURLED AT THEIR ENEMIES WITH THEIR SLINGS HOW DO WE KNOW WELL DOCTOR JOHN REID IS CHAIRMAN OF THE DRUM ON AND TRUST A ROMAN HISTORY SOCIETY BASED IN THE SCOTTISH BORDERS GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING JOHN AND WE KNOW BECAUSE YOU FOUND WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM BULLETS DON'T YOU THE STONES THAT THEY THREW WITH HOLES IN THEM
THEY REALLY ARE BULLETS FERAL LED THE CAST IN LEAD THERE THEY COME IN TWO VARIETIES ARE BIGGER SHAPES ARE BIGGER HIS WEIGHT OF ABOUT TWO OUNCES AND OLD MUDDY OR ALMOST SIXTY GRAMS AND THEIR LEMON SHAPED AND THERE'S A SMALLER VARIETY THAT WERE ABOUT TWENTY GRAMS WITH A HOLE IN THEM AND WE WE COULDN'T INITIALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS HALL ACTUALLY MEANT I KNOW YOU DO
WELL WE HAD A COUPLE OF BITS OF LUCK THE HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND GAVE US A GRANT TO TO DO A CIVILIAN A DIG AND WE FOUND SEVEN HUNDRED BULLETS WHICH IS AN AWFUL LOT MORE OF THEM HAVE BEEN FOUND IN MANY OTHER STATES IN EUROPE AND WE ALSO FOUND THIS SMALL TAPE AND ALSO COME ARCHAEOLOGY HAVE PICKED UP ON THE STORY AND THEY'VE GIVEN US SOME HELP AND WE'VE ALSO HAD HELP FROM HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT SCOTLAND RIGHT AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO YOU THAT THEY WERE USED
THE HOLES IN THEM WERE PUT THERE YEAH TO CREATE THAT SOUND YEAH WELL BUT INITIALLY THIS THIS IS ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK REALLY I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE HOLES WERE DESIGNED FOR POISON BECAUSE WE KNOW THE ROMANS POISON MISSILES BUT THE HALL'S QUITE SMALL THERE'S ONLY FIVE MILLIMETRES IN DIAMETER BUT ALL THE HALLS HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE REGULATION SIZE IN EACH ONE OF THESE SMALLER MISSILES
I KNOW IT WAS MY BROTHER HE'S A FISHERMAN WHO SAID ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT WITH A FOUR OF THESE ARE FROM MY CAN I SOUND AND I SAID BUT WHAT IF WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY AND I SAID WELL I'M CASTING UM THE THE WEIGHTS THE LEAD WEIGHTS THAT I'VE GOT THAT WE'VE GOT HOLES IN THEM LIKE THIS THE QUETZAL SO WE CAST WE CAST ONE HUNDRED REPLICAS AND HE'S A BIT OF A SWINGER BECAUSE HE SWINGS ITS BEAT INTO THE SEA
HE TRIED THESE THINGS UNSURE ENOUGH THEY MADE THIS NOISE AND I TELL YOU IF YOU'RE STANDING THERE AND ONE OF HIS CAUSE PAST YOUR EUROPE IT'S VERY UNPLEASANT BUT IS IT FRIGHTENING AND IT DOES IT WOULD IT REALLY HAVE SCARED THE ENEMY OH WELL I THINK THE THING ABOUT THE SLING BULLETS IS THAT THE ANCIENT AUTHORS SAY THAT THEY WERE SILENT AND AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE COMING SO THAT THE CHAP NEXT WHO WOULD JUST FOLD THAT IN A FEE WAS HET
BY ONE OF THESE FENCE CRIES HAVE TO MAKE OUR SOUND IN A MISSILE STORM YOU ARE STARTING TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE TO KEEP THEIR HEADS DOWN THE SITE THERE'S A PEACH OF A SITE WON'T WORK WHERE WE'VE FOUND THESE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE SITE IT WAS THE SITE OF A MAJOR ASSAULT COS OF COURSE IT ISN'T ISN'T IT ISN'T IF YOU GOT ONE COMING OUT TOO YOU CAN HEAR THEM HUNDREDS MAYBE THOUSANDS
THAT'S RIGHT THAT MOVE FIND MISSILES ACROSS A FULL HALF KILOMETRE OF THE FRONT SORT OF THIS ISN'T JUST YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF MISSILES AND A LITTLE PATCH ALL MINERS YEAH YEAH WELL WHAT A FASCINATING DISCOVERY JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT IS NOW TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER A YOU DO THIS MORNING IS ELIZABETH OLDFIELD DIRECTOR OF THEOS THEIR RELIGION AND SOCIETY THINK TANK MONTY GOOD MORNING NICK
ONE NEWS STORY THIS WEEK WILL HAVE STRUCK FEAR AND PERHAPS SOMETHING A BIT LESS GENEROUS INTO THE HEARTS OF PARENTS EVERYWHERE THE KILLING OF A GORILLA IN CINCINNATI DO AFTER A THREE YEAR OLD BOY FELL INTO THE ENCLOSURE HAS LED TO VOCAL CRITICISM OF THE MOTHER AND FATHER INVOLVED
THE ACTIONS OF THE PARENTS ARE OF COURSE OF INTEREST TO THE POLICE AND WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE
WHAT IS CLEAR HOWEVER IS HOW QUICKLY IN AN ONLINE EDGE WE ARE PREPARED TO LEAP TO CONCLUSIONS
NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A PETITION CALLING FOR THE PARENTS TO BE CHARGED WITH NEGLECT AND THEIR HOME LIFE INVESTIGATE IT
JUDGEMENT THEY USUALLY ON A LESS DRAMATIC SCALE SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE D.N.A. OF PARENTING SOMETHING ABOUT THE ANXIETY INDUCING RESPONSIBILITY OVER A MILLION TINY DECISIONS BREEDS CRITICISM OF OTHERS
AS A NOUN VETERAN OF TODDLER GROUPS I KNOW HOW THIS GOES I CAN'T SEEM TO REFRAIN FROM INTERNALLY TUTTING AT THEIR DAD FEEDING HIS THREE YEAR OLDS CRISPS AND FIZZY DRINKS
LATER IN THE WEEK WHEN I'M SHOVELLING A READY MEAL DONE MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE I'M LATE HOME FROM WORK AND THE CUPBOARD IS INEXPLICABLY DEVOID OF ORGANIC CANE WHAT WELL THAT'S DIFFERENT OF COURSE
BREASTFEEDING SCREEN TIME DIET DISCIPLINE ALL AREAS WHERE PARENTS OFTEN FEEL WE ARE FAILING BUT PERHAPS NOT FEELING QUITE AS BADLY AS THAT PERSON OVER THERE
AND THAT SELF RIGHTEOUS GLOW GET HELPS US FEEL A BIT BETTER THIS IS KNOWN TO SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGISTS A SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS BASICALLY WE TEND TO OVERESTIMATE IN OURSELVES TRAITS THAT SOCIETY VALUES MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE ABOVE AVERAGE DRIVERS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS CLEARLY STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
CHRISTIANITY DOESN'T YOU SUCH A SPECIFIC TO THAT WHEN JESUS ASKS WHY WE FIXATE ON THE SPEC IN ANOTHER'S EYE WHILE IGNORING THE PLANK IN OUR OWN THIS IS WHAT HE'S ON ABOUT AND HE'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT'S JUST NOT ON
JUDGE NOT LEST YOU BE JUDGED IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE AND ALSO ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO APPLY
SO BEFORE SWEARING BUT THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD EVER LET MY CHILD OUT OF MY SIGHT LONG ENOUGH TO GET INTO DANGER AND CAUSED THE DEATH OF A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE WE'RE GOING TO DO INSTEAD MY FAITH FORCES ME TOWARDS A RADICALLY REALISTIC SELF ASSESSMENT OF COURSE I COULD HAVE DONE JUST THAT I AM AS FOOLISH AND AS FRAGILE AND US FAILING AS ANYONE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF HELP AND FORGIVENESS
AND ADMITTING THAT RATHER THAN POINTING THE FINGER AT OTHERS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO START
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH ELIZABETH OLDFIELD DIRECTOR OF THREE OS THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT GO TO ANY HOSPITAL ONE THING IS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THE N.H.S. DEPENDS ON THE WORK ON THE DEDICATION OF A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM BLACK ASIAN OR MINORITY ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS ONE IN THREE DOCTORS ONE IN FIVE NURSES WORKING IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND ARE NON WHITE
ALL THE MORE TROUBLING THEN HAD A REPORT TODAY REVEALS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF BULLYING HARASSMENT AND ABUSE THAN THEIR WHITE COLLEAGUES NOT FROM PATIENTS BUT FROM THE PEOPLE THEY WORK WITH AND WORK FOR
JOINEES TO DISCUSS THAT JOAN SANDLER CO CHAIR OF THE N.H.S. EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COUNCIL AND AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT THE N.H.S. CONFEDERATION AND ELSIE GAIL JOINS ON THE LINE FROM BIRMINGHAM SHE'S A FORMER N.H.S. MIDWIFE NOW AN INDEPENDENT MIDWIFE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GENTLEMEN EVENING FIRST OF ALL YOU SURPRISED BY THE FINDING OF THIS OR FRIENDLY DOES IT MERELY CONFIRMED WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
ABSOLUTELY CONFIRMS WHAT WE'VE THOUGHT AND EXPERIENCED AND THIS IS SURVEY EVIDENCE IN OTHER WORDS IT'S ASKING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IT AND CAN CAN YOU PUT INTO WORDS THE SORTS OF THINGS WE MIGHT MEAN BY HARASSMENT BULLYING AND ABUSE IS IT PEOPLE JUST FEELING AS IT WERE NEGLECTED AND THE ODD RUDE WORD OR IS IT OFTEN MUCH MORE ACTIVE A MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT
MUCH MORE SERIOUS WE HAVE GRIEVANCES WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WILL EXPERIENCE ONGOING MISTREATMENT TREATMENT THAT MAKES THEM FEEL ILL
THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY DO THE JOB THAT THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO THEY ARE ON THEIR MIND THEY ARE OVERLOOKED FOR PROMOTION ALL OF THIS CAN BE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE ALMOST AND ACTUALLY IT'S HAPPENING TO A LOT OF STAFF SO THE SCALE IS IMPORTANT AND YOU BELIEVE IF THIS IS A PROPER DISTINCTION THAT THIS IS AS IT WERE ACTIVE RACISM
OR IS IT BASED ON THE KIND OF IGNORANCE OR CUT OF CULTURAL IGNORANCE ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE HER OWN WORKED WELL O.K. SO WE CAN GO BACK TO MAKE FEARSOME SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RACISM THAT CAN OCCUR AT THE PREJUDICE THAT CAN OCCUR THE CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS
THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN YOU BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER THEY ALL ADD UP TO QUITE A RANGE OF EXPERIENCES FOR BEING ME PEOPLE LET ME BRING IN ELSIE GAIL A FORMER N.H.S. MIDWIFE I WAS SAYING IS THAT
MATCH YOUR EXPERIENCE NOT JUST PERSONAL BUT THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH IN THE N.H.S. ELSIE YES INDEED WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS BEHAVIOUR HAPPENS AT ALL LEVELS OF THE N.H.S. IT DAMAGES CARE GIVERS AND IN PARTICULAR DISPLAY
FORTUNATELY SO BLACK AND MINORITY ETHNIC START OFF IT ALSO DAMAGES PATIENCE AND THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR MYSELF AND THE MIDWIVES WHO TH FOR WOMEN BECAUSE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY CAUSES AN IMPACT FOR THEM THE FASCINATING THING IN THIS RESEARCH ELSIE IS THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN THE SURVEY AT LEAST THAT BLACK MCGUIRE LIKE NURSES AND DOCTORS GET MORE DISCRIMINATION FROM THE PATIENTS
THE PROBLEM IS FROM THEIR COLLEAGUES NOW BUT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS A CONSEQUENCE FOR PATIENTS WHAT IS IT THERE IS INDEED SO FOR EXAMPLE IN FACT ONLY JUST THIS WEEK COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF MET WITH THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MIDWIVES AROUND THEIR EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE PRODUCED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS THE IMPACT
ON BLACK STAFF BUT WE ALSO SEE FROM THE NATIONAL ATTORNEY TO REVIEWS ON SERVICE THE OUTCOMES FOR BLACK MOTHERS AND BABIES ARE WORSE THAN FOR OTHER WOMEN IN THE SERVICE FOR A VERY LONG TIME JAMES ADLER YOU HAVE ARGUED FOR MORE BLACK LEADERS IN THE N.H.S. YOU KNOW GO BACK GET TWO YEARS AGO YOU WERE SAYING WAS CRUCIAL TO DEAL WITH IS THAT THE KEY SOLUTION AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED BUT MORE BLACK AND ETHNIC MINORITY MANAGES AND LEADERS
WHO HAVE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MANAGE THEIR STUFF ONE OF THE KEY SOLUTIONS BUT LET'S LET'S NOT BE UNDER ANY ILLUSION IT ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE MICHAEL WEST'S WORK THAT SAYS IF YOU ENGAGE MORE PEOPLE AND IF YOU ENGAGE MORE DIVERSE PEOPLE YOU GET BETTER PATIENT CARE WHERE SAYING THAT DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT
IT'S NOT JUST BE ANY PEOPLE ITS DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT THAT LEADS TO BETTER DECISION MAKING GIVING YOU'RE MORE OF A VARIETY OF THE DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE ARE TO LEADERSHIP LEVEL CAN THEN LEAD TO A BETTER MODEL OF CARE AND ELSIE DO YOU THINK WHAT'S CRUCIAL IN THIS IS WHO MANAGES YOU OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S NOT ENOUGH IN ITSELF
I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER WE ALL HAVE TO HAVE IN FACT THIS IS A STRUCTURAL SITUATION AND YOU KNOW IT IS SYSTEMIC IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT A LOCAL LEVEL OR CORPORATE LOVE LEMON INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL EVEN OUR REGULATORS ARE IMPACTED BY THESE THESE BEHAVIOURS SO WE HAVE TO HAVE INSIGHT I THINK ALL OF US HAVE TO HAVE INSIGHT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE CAUSING THESE BEHAVIOURS AND THEN
WITH COMMITMENT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION OF JANE'S OTHER INTRIGUING TO READ THE COMMENTS OF SIMON STEVENS IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND SO YOU'D HAVE THREE BACK BOSS IS ALL IN PRIVATE COMPANIES NOT ONE IN ALL HIS YEARS WORKING IN THE N.H.S. AND THIS IS A PUBLIC SECTOR PROP
YES IT IS AND SIMON WAS PARTICULARLY TALKING ABOUT THE NON U.K. ENVIRONMENT
YEAH YOU WORK FOR AN AMERICAN OUTSKIRTS WERE VERY LONG TO SO WE JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE IS THE U.K. IN TERMS OF ITS PUBLIC SECTOR LOVED SERVICE AS THE N.H.S. SAYS WE DO NEED TO UP OUR GAME ON BRINGING IN THE BEST TALENT WELL LOSING OUT HERE PATIENTS ARE LOSING OUT OUR STAFF ARE LOSING MOTIVATION TO THAT IS FINDING NEW PEOPLE TO RUN THE N.H.S. AND SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FOR PATIENT CARE YEAH LETS THE NEW PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN THE SERVICE
YEAH SO THAT DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE THAT BREADTH OF PEOPLE NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE SERVICE AS WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE AND THEY NEED TO BE TAKEN FROM THE MIDDLE RANKS AND TAKEN HIGHER UP IN YOUR VIEW AND THE OUTSIDE RANKS AS WELL THOSE WERE NOT IN THE N.H.S. GEMS OUT OF ELSIE GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE SECOND OF JUNE THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE LEADER OF THE G.M.P. UNION SAID LABOUR MUST DO MORE TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR THE U.K. REMAINING IN THE E.U. TO HIM ROACH SAID JEREMY CORBIN MUST ALSO EASE VOTERS FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
A BRITISH MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE GIVEN THE WRONG NEWBORN BABY IN EL SALVADOR YOU GO HAVE SPOKEN OF THEIR RELIEF AFTER RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR SON AND BRITAIN IS LEADING CALLS FOR THE UNITED NATIONS TO BEGIN DROPPING HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE TRAPPED IN BESIEGED AREAS OF SYRIA AND THEIR SECRETS
OF THE PEPPERED MOTH HAVE BEEN REVEALED B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY NEIL STATE THE NEW LEADER OF ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST UNIONS THE G.M. BE TIM ROACH HAS SAID THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL FAIL UNLESS LABOUR VOTERS BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN THE DEBATE IN A B.B.C. INTERVIEW HE SAYS THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN MUST BOOM OR TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE E.U. AT THESE PEOPLE'S FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
MY CORBIN WILL GIVE A SPEECH TODAY IN WHICH WILL SAY THERE'S AN EXIT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN BRITAIN IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
THE WARNING BY THE NEW LEADER OF THE G.M. BE TIM ROACH REFLECTS WIDESPREAD CONCERN WITHIN THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN THAT MANY LABOUR VOTERS ARE CONFUSED AND APATHETIC ABOUT THIS REFERENDUM MY CORBIN WILL TODAY SEEK TO ADDRESS THIS IN A SPEECH STRESSING THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE E.U. INCLUDING PAID LEAVE PROTECTION FOR PART TIME WORKERS AND MATERNITY PAY ALL AT RISK HE WILL SAY IN BRITAIN VOTES FOR BRECHT'S IT
HOWEVER MISTER ROACH TODAY URGES MISTER CORBIN TO FOCUS MORE ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION SUBJECT THE LABOUR LEADER HAS RARELY ADDRESSED AND IS EXPECTED TO MENTION ONLY IN PASSING THIS MORNING
IN A B.B.C. INTERVIEW MY ROACH WARNS THE SUBJECT CANNOT BE IGNORED FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE APOLOGIST FOR THE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT NOW IS WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE VERY REAL CONCERNS IN WORKING PEOPLE'S MINDS TOP FRONT AND CENTRE AT THAT CAUSE IMMIGRATION THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND WHAT WE SEE IS
EMPLOYERS INTRODUCING PEOPLE FROM EASTERN EUROPE PARTICULARLY COMING OVER TAKING JOBS AT FAR LOWER PAY IN TERMS OF ADDITIONS THAT IS LEADING TO RESENT
THE G.M.P.

THE DANGER IS THAT WITH THAT OF LEADERS MAKING'S A SPEECH AND THEN THINKING THAT EVERYBODY HAS HEARD IT AND THAT THE DANGER WE LEARNT THAT LESSON LAST YEAR IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN I THINK WE NEED TO BE TREATING THIS REFERENDUM AS THOUGH IT WAS A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND HAVING EVERYBODY OUT ON THE DOORSTEP IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR WORKING PEOPLE
GEORGE OSBORNE AND THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR ALISTAIR DARLING HAVE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER TO VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS ACCUSING THEM OF COMING UP WITH UM COSTED AND UNWORKABLE PROPOSALS AND CHALLENGING THEM TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING UP POLICIES AS THEY GO ALONG

AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY'VE FINALLY BEEN ISSUED WITH A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR MOSES ONLY THIS WEEK THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RETURN HOME WITH HIM
AND ONLY NOW BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DETAIL THEY HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO TELL US HOW THEY FEEL
WONDERFUL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL FINALLY THIS ORDEAL THAT HAS BEEN GOING NOW FOR NINE MONTHS IS OVER HERE AND I JUST FELT EXAM ASPIRATED DAIRY WAS NOT ENDING AND IT'S ENDED
IT'S WONDERFUL AND NOW MOSES HAS SLEPT IN HIS OWN CREW YOU KNOW HE'S LEARNED THREE FINALLY WE ARE OVERWHELMED WERE HAPPY
WE FEEL SAFE I SLEPT THE WHOLE NOPE GOOD LAST NIGHT
HE SLEPT HE OVERSLEPT AT THEY WE JUST FEEL VERY HAPPY VERY THANKFUL AND THERE WE ARE
HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER FINALLY SO HE WAS BORN IN MAY LAST YEAR MAY TWENTY FIFTEEN YES IMMEDIATELY WHEN HE
TAKEN OUT OF ME
HE WAS PASSED BY ME AND THEY GAVE HIM A KISS AND THEN THEY TOOK HIM TO THE NURSERY HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NURSERY
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM SO THAT WAS HE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING THEY WERE DUE TO BRING HIM BACK TO YOU I WAS TOLD
HE WOULD COME SOON BUT HE NEVER CAME TILL NO ONE NO ONE I GOT MY BABY AND WHEN I SAW HIM THE FIRST IMPRESSION
THIS IS THE SAME BABY THEN I SAW LAST NIGHT I STARTED TO TELL
THE STAFF THAT WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY ARE INSISTED END SAID NOW THIS IS YOUR BABY SO I'M LIKE OH KAY THIS IS MAYBE HE'D BE HERE
BUT YOUR MOTHER'S INSTINCT TOLD YOU IT WAS NOT IN YET STILL YOU TOOK THAT CHILD WHO BROUGHT THAT CHILD HOME HERE TO TEXAS THE WEEK BEFORE WE CAME TO THE DECISION TO GO AND MAKE A D.N.A. TEST WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE D.N.A. TEST
ZERO POINT ZERO PER CENT THE MOTHER OF THE BABY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THAT WAS YOUR SON IMPASSABLE ZERO POINT ZERO
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM ANYWAY WHAT IT FELT LIKE AT THAT MOMENT I JUST FELL ON THE FLOOR IT WAS MY BODY CAN EVEN
THE PING
I THOUGHT I HAD THE BABY THAT I HAVE BEEN NURSING TAKEN CARE
LOVING HIM AND BABYING HIM THAT HE WAS THAT MINE
AND THEN I HEARD ANOTHER THOUGHT WHICH CAME WITH THAT WHERE'S MY BABY SO I HAD TO THAT
WHAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS BABY AND NOISE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TRY
TO ME WAS OH MY GOODNESS I HAVE A CHILD AND MY CHILD IS SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD WHERE IZZY
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO WHY DID THIS HAPPEN AM I EVER GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN AND NOW
FELT LIKE A PANIC THAT MY ONLY CHILD WAS LAST STA STOLEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS
THAT WAS THE CONCERN HE ALWAYS ASKED WAS THERE THAT I STARTED TO PRAY
OF WE MIGHT LOSE THIS CHILD THAT WE'VE BEEN RAISING FOR THREE MONTHS I REMEMBER THAT WAS SORT OF THE SECOND DRAMA LIKE LOOK AT THIS CHILD HAS A LEGITIMATE FAMILY AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE HIM AWAY THEY DID TRACK DOWN YOUR BIOLOGICAL CHILD THEY DID D.N.A. TESTS ON OTHER BABIES BORN THAT IS SHOOTING AT THE HOSPITAL AND THEY FOUND YOUR BIOLOGICAL CHILD
AND THEN VERY QUICKLY I THINK WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS YOU HAD TO HAND OVER THE CHILD YOU'VE BEEN CARING FOR IT WAS LIKE IT WAS SEPTEMBER THE SEVERN
TWENTY FIFTEEN I REMEMBER THAT THE JUDGE CALLED ME INTO HER ROOM WE FOUND YOU A B.
WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT I THOUGHT
I COULD ONLY WHEN HER WORDS WERE LIKE WHY
YOUR FAMILY BUT I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND I COULD WAS IT WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL GREAT RELIEF AND MY LAWYER SAID WE HAVE TO BRING THE OTHER BABY
AND LIKE ALL RIGHT HE'S OVER HERE WE FOUND A FAMILY AND YOU HAVE TO HAND THEM IN
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT THAT'S WHEN I REALISED THAT UNTIL HE TOLD ME YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE OTHER WAY THERE WAS I CAN'T
AND WE GOT THERE AND WE HAD TO LIKE WE WERE RUSHED THEN WE HAVE TO
GO QUICKLY BRING THE BABY AND WE BARELY GOT TIME TO SAY GOODBYE
AARON WE CUT I GOT ALL THOSE CLOTHES
AND WE TOOK HIM
IN THE OFFICE AND WE CAN GET HIM IN
AND THAT WAS
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART I THINK OF ALL THE SITUATION
THEN AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO SAD WE'VE HAD A BABY AND THAT WAS SO HAPPY ANOTHER FEELING WE FINALLY SAW HIM IN WHEN HE WAS HE WAS SMILING
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH JACOB NOW THE LAST TIME WE SAW HIM JUST RECENTLY HE WAS HEALTHY AND HAPPY YOU HAD MOSES HANDED BACK TO YOU
NINE YEAH NINE MONTHS AGO OR SO WHITE WHY'S IT TAKEN SO LONG
TO BRING HIM HOME TO DALLAS TAKEN NINE MONTHS TO GET PAPERWORK FOR THIS CHILD HAS BEEN PROBABLY THE MOST PAINFUL PART OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS IT'S FORCED OUR FAMILY USED TO BE SEPARATED
NINE MIND'S EAR IT'S JUST ALMOST BANKRUPTED US FINANCIALLY IT'S JUST BEEN IT'S BEEN AWFUL WHEN I FOR THIS FIRST HAPPENED I HAD HOPED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MATTER OF DAYS MAYBE WEEKS AND I NEVER IMAGINED IT WOULD TAKE NINE MUDS AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THIS FORCED SEPARATION I LIKE THIS
IT'S BEEN DREADFUL DO YOU HAVE ANY CLEAR IDEA
AS TO EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED NO OUR COUNTRY IS INVESTIGATING STILL
AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD GIVEN A SEMI INTO A WHAT HAPPENED IS THIS ALL OVER AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED
THE MAJORITY OF IT IS THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING AND I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO SEE JUSTICE IN THE SITUATION MATTHEW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN COS I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PERSON AND IF JUSTICE WAS BROUGHT TO THE SITUATION AND THE PERPETRATORS POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS IN THE FUTURE MIGHT THINK TWICE
DOING THE THINGS THAT THEY DID TO US WE'VE GOT THE BABY BACK AND FINALLY I CAN TELL YOU
I FEEL THAT I'M IN A SAFE PLACE MY LIFE AND MY BABY'S LIFE IS IN THE SAFE PLACE
THAT WAS MATTHEW PRICE TALKING TO THE COUPLE WHOSE SON WAS SWAPPED IN EL SALVADOR THE TIME IS NO NINETEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT ONE OF THE MANY PROBLEMS OF TRYING TO CARE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS DEMENTIA OFTEN HEARTBREAKING PROBLEMS HE'S HAVING NO REAL SENSE OF WHAT IT IS THEY'RE GOING THROUGH NOT BEING ABLE
TO SEE THE SOMETIMES FRIGHTENINGLY CHANGING WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES WILL NOW IT'S PARTLY POSSIBLE TO DO THAT PLEASE GET SOME SENSE OF IT A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND WHEN YOU USE IT YOU GET SOME IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SUFFER FROM DEMENTIA HE'S SOME
SENSE AT LEAST OF WHAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU PUT ON THE HEADSET
HELLO I'M ON THE FLORA OH HELLO HIYA WE'RE ON OUR WAY CAN YOU PUT THE KETTLE ON WHAT DO YOU WANT JUST THINK USUAL PLEASE
MILK AND TWO SUGARS FOR ME TO WELCOME TO SHUTTLE SLANG SUGAR AND MILK FOR TIM
COME ON UP FOR TIM YES I'M GOING TO HELP YOU SHOULD HAVE A LOLLY
YOU REMEMBER TRIM IT LIKE THAT YOU I THINK I'VE GOT A PHOTO THE GONE IN THE FRIDGE MUM OF COURSE SEE YOU IN A MINUTE ALL RIGHT
SURE
WAS IT THREE SHOULD BE I'M NOT I'M NO TWO SUGARS
THAT WAS DAME HARRIET WALTER PLAYING THE POLE I'M WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS DEMENTIA THE SAME SORT OF DEMENTIA THE TERRY PRATCHETT IS IT HAPPENS SUFFERED FROM SHE'S TRINA ARMSTRONG AND SHE'S RIGHT HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH HER HUSBAND GRAHAM AND ALSO WITH HILARY EVANS WHO'S THE C.E.O. OF ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH MISSUS ARMSTRONG
CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT IT WAS THAT SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN DID YOU FIRST SORT OF REALISED HOW DID YOU REALISE THAT YOU HAD SOME FORM OF DEMENTIA
I WAS JUST DISCUSSING ME AND THAT
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T ME THAT NOTICED IT FIRST IT WAS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE CLOSE TO ME NOTICED CHANGES IN IN MY BEHAVIOUR
AT SOMEBODY WHO I WAS WORKING WITH SAID THAT I SUDDENLY COULD NOT RECALL A TELEPHONE NUMBERS LIKE AYE I USED TO WHEN I WAS WORKING IT WAS ALL IN MY BRAIN
THAT HOPE I HAD ACTUALLY SEEM TO HAVE GONE AND ALSO
PLAYING CARDS WHEN I WAS PLAYING WE WERE ON HOLIDAY WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND WE ALWAYS USED TO SIT DOWN IN THE EVENING AND PLAY CARDS
ALL OF A SUDDEN I FOUND I COULDN'T PUT THINGS IN IT IN THE RIGHT SUIT AND THEY SAID WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU YOU HAVE
YOU WERE SO QUICK AT THIS BEFORE AND IT WAS THAT TIME THOSE THE FIRST SIGNS THAT
OH YES THE WHAT'S GOING WRONG HERE THERE'S SOME YEAH I COULDN'T I JUST CARRIED ON AS NORMAL AND YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU OBVIOUSLY NOTICED THE CHANGES AS WELL I DID I SAY
I DID NOTICE THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING WRONG THERE AND THEN BUT IT CAME THROUGH THE INITIALLY WENT TO THE OPTICIAN'S EYE TEST THERE WAS REFERRED UP TO THE HOSPITAL THEY SAID IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH YOU HAVING HAD A STROKE
IT'S QUITE COMMON APPARENTLY FOR POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY THE GROUP PERFORMER DEMENTIA THE TRAINER HAS TO PAY FOR THEIR DIAGNOSES TO COME THROUGH AT A STROKE HAS YE YE CAN DAE THE SYMPTOMS ARE VERY SIMILAR EXCEPT THE STROKE ONCE YOU'VE HAD THAT
IT REMAINS CONSTANT BUT WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROGRESSIVE ELEMENT IN THIS AND WHEN WE THEN GOT A REFERRAL TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SCIENCE AND GOT THE DIAGNOSIS OF P.C.A. IT ALL FITTED
TOGETHER THE PROGRESSIVE ELEMENT WAS THERE AND THAT MADE A LOT MORE SENSE THAN THE THAN A STROKE BUT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON APPARENTLY FOR THE DIAGNOSES TO APPEAR VIA A STROKE
AND HILARY ARMSTRONG NOT THE HEADSET DOES IS GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE A POLICE SENSE OF WHAT I KEEP AND BESIDES THE BIGGER THE OF COURSE YOU CAN'T HAVE THE FULL PICTURE AND OBVIOUSLY BUT THE TINY IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE THIS SORT OF CONFUSION IN YOUR BRAIN ALL THE TIME
YEAH WELL THIS THIS APP CALLED MONTHLY DEMENTIA IS REALLY SEE TO SHOW WHAT LIFE CAN BE LIKE SO WHAT SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA HAVE TO BATTLE WITH IT ON EVERY DAY BASIS TAKES YOU THROUGH GOING TO THE SUPERMARKET TRYING TO BUY SOME TEA BAGS
GETTING HOME TO TRY AND MAKE A CUP OF TEA FOR YOUR FAMILY IS SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED AND DO DAY IN DAY OUT BUT ACTUALLY WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE TO GET TO THE SUPERMARKET TO FIND THE TEABAGS
AND I MAKE THAT CUP OF TEA AND HOW DEMENTIA ACTUALLY THEN CHALLENGES ALL OF THOSE POTS OF DECISION MAKING OF MEMORY AND THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MEMORY WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT FORGETTING WHERE YOU PUT YOUR KEYS ARE FORGETTING HER NAME THERE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS THAT PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA LIVE WITH AND WE KNOW THE DIMENSIONS REALLY STILL VERY MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC SO THAT SHE CAN SEE THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT HOW WE CAN TRY AND GET ACROSS USING ACTUALLY PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA TO
TELL US WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH DEMENTIA AND SHE'S A VIRTUAL REALITY AT UP TO THEN TRY AND EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE AND THIS IS THE THING WHEN YOU GO INTO A SUPERMARKET FOR INSTANCE IF YOU GO INTO A SUPERMARKET TO BUY THREE OR FOUR ITEMS YOU YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY DOESN'T REMIND YOU OF WHAT YOU NEED AND WHERE TO FIND THEM AND HOW TO HANDLE THE MONEY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
YES YOU CAN'T I CAN'T RECOGNISE ANYTHING IF YOU WANTED TO GO IN AND GET THAT CERTAIN THINGS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FIND THEM YOU CAN'T SEE THE SHAPE OF THEM AND THINGS JUST DON'T LOOK THE SAME I USUALLY GET HELP
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THE SUPERMARKET AND AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED GRAHAM HAVING THIS HEADSET HAS IT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TRINA I THINK FROM FROM MY FROM MY VIEW CERTAINLY THE THE
SCENARIOS THAT ARE PORTRAYED IN THE UP A PRETTY ACCURATE I THINK A VERY ACCURATE AS TO HOW
TRINA SEES IT FROM WHAT I SEE THE DIFFICULTIES OR TRINA HAS IN TERMS OF ITS RECOGNITION IS READING CAN'T READ CAN'T WRITE NOW AND RECOGNITION OF PEOPLE
OBJECTS ON THE TABLE ARE DIFFICULT AS ONE OF THE SCENARIOS WHERE A PUDDLE OF WATER ON THE ROAD CAN APPEAR LIKE A HOLE IN THE ROAD SO YOU YOU WORRY DO YOU ABOUT A FULL THERE'S A WHOLE RATHER THAN
WALK WALK AND PULL AND THE IDEA OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IT IS THAT WE GET SOME IDEA OF WHAT DEMENTIA IS IN ALL ITS MANY MANY VARIED FORM ON THE SUN AND IT IS OF COURSE IT'S AN ILLNESS IT'S NOT A SYMPTOM OF GROWING OLDER OR ANY OF THAT NONSENSE IT IS ONLY AT IDENTIFIABLE ILLNESS IN VARIOUS FORMS ABSOLUTELY AND REALLY YOU KNOW DEMENTIA IS IS CAUSED BY DISEASES OUT SIMON'S OFTEN BEING THE MOST COMMON THAT PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THAT THERE'S OTHER FORMS OF DEMENTIA
AS IF HEAD P.C.A. A BIT WITH THE OTHER FORMS THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH AND EACH OF THOSE FORMS OF DEMENTIA CARRY VERY DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS OF WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS ILLUSTRATE WHAT SOME OF THOSE SIMPSONS ARE AND WHAT LIFE CAN BE LIKE THAT IN WIGS AND IDEA ISN'T THERE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR PEOPLE NOT JUST CARERS BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING ON IT WOULD GIVE US SOME SENSE OF
OF HOW TO RECOGNISE HAPPENS PERHAPS THE DISEASE AND I THINK IF ACTUALLY PEOPLE WE'RE ALL IN THE SUPERMARKET OR GETTING A SHEEP AND REALISING ACTUALLY WHAT THAT PERSON NEXT YEAR AT THE TAIL MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT MONEY OR TRYING TO FIND PRODUCTS OFF THE SHELF I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL BUT ACTUALLY FOR THE PUBLIC THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF DEMENTIA WE KNOW IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST HEALTH CONDITIONS
THAT WE FACE BUT THIS IS CAUSED BY DISEASE AND THEREFORE WE KNOW WITH ENOUGH RESEARCH AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONDITION WE WILL FIND TREATMENTS BUT WAS STILL A LITTLE WAY FROM MUD AND TRAINER OBVIOUSLY YOUR BRAIN WORKS VERY WELL IN SOME RESPECTS QUITE CLEARLY BUT WHEN YOU SEE THIS
WHEN YOU PUT ON THIS HEADSET WHEN YOU LOOK INTO IT DO YOU SORT OF RECOGNISE YOURSELF AND YOUR SYMPTOMS AND DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT HELP PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH OH YES
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY THINK OF TIMERS IS AND THEY'RE FRIGHTENED OF THAT IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR SYMPTOMS MIGHT BE AND THAT THESE ARE QUITE COMMON SYMPTOMS AREN'T THEY WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE OR WORK OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES IN THINGS IN A SUPERMARKET
WELL THAT THAT THAT IS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR COMING TRINA AND TO GRAHAM AND HILARY THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH

THE NEW LEADER OF THE G. B. UNION TIM ROACH HAS WARNED THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN COULD LOSE THE E.U. REFERENDUM UNLESS LABOUR VOTE HAS BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN THE DEBATE IN A B.B.C. INTERVIEW HE URGES THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN TO DO MORE TO ARGUE THE CASE FOR STAYING IN THE UNION AND HE SAYS LABOUR MUST EASE VOTERS FEARS ABOUT IMMIGRATION
THE FORMER CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE PROMINENT VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGNER HAS ACCUSED DOWNING STREET IN THE REMAIN CAMP OF SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR VOTERS ON IMMIGRATION HE SAID DAVID CAMERON NEEDED TO SET OUT HOW HE PLANNED TO EASE PRESSURE ON THE N.H.S. SCHOOLS AND HOUSING
A COUPLE WHO WERE GIVEN THE WRONG BABY BY HOSPITAL IN EL SALVADOR A YEAR AGO HAVE FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED TO TRAVEL HOME TO THE UNITED STATES WITH THEIR SON THEIR CHILDREN WERE HANDED BACK TO THEIR REAL PARENTS EIGHT MONTHS AGO BUT RICH COUCH WERE CASH WORTH WHO IS BRITISH AND HIS WIFE MERCY WERE ONLY GIVEN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR THEIR SON MOSES A FEW DAYS AGO
A DECISION ON THE FUTURE OF THE HIGH STREET RETAILER B.H.S. IS EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY THE FIRM WENT INTO ADMINISTRATION IN APRIL JUST A YEAR AFTER IT WAS SOLD BY SIR PHILIP GREEN FOR ONE POUND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NAIL IT'S TWENTY SIX MINUTES TONIGHT IT'LL MAKE US POORER MUCH POORER NO NO IT WILL IN FACT MAKE US RICHER THAT'S AN ADMITTEDLY RATHER BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE THERE IS ONE BIG DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THE REMAIN SIDE HAVE ALL THE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS
AND MOST ESTABLISHED ECONOMISTS ON THEIR SIDE TODAY THE FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER ALISTAIR DARLING JOINS FORCES WITH THE CURRENT TORY CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE TO CALL ON THE LEAVES SO I HAD TO ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE AND COSTED AND UNWORKABLE PROPOSALS MEANWHILE PROFESSOR PATRICK MINFORD ABOUT CHAIRS THE SMALL GROUP OF ECONOMISTS WHO SAY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAS ONCE AGAIN GOT IT ALL WRONG HE'S PLANNING TO EXPLAIN WHY HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES ARE IN FACT RIGHT ALISTAIR DARLING JOINS ME ON THE LINE FROM EDINBURGH PROFESSOR MINFORD IS HERE
IN THE STUDIO WITH ME ALISTAIR DARLING FIRST OF ALL IF I MAY WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT THESE GUYS WHO WANT BRICKS IT OR GIVING YOU KNOW ANSWERS TO
THE OVERWHELMING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC ECONOMIC OPINION IS THAT IF WE LEAVE THERE WILL BE AN IMMEDIATE HIT AND INDEED SOME OF THE CAMPAIGN HAVE ADMITTED THERE WILL BE A HIT TO JOBS THERE'LL ALSO BE A LONGER TERM HIT AND OF COURSE THAT'S COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU VOTE TO LEAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST SINGLE MARKET THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS IT IS FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN
WHO ARE ASKING US TO TAKE THIS LEAP INTO THE DARK TO SPELL OUT ACTUALLY WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW WOULD WE GET NEW TRADE DEALS HOW ON EARTH COULD YOU EXPECT TO GET BETTER THAN YOU'VE GOT AT THE MOMENT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS ACCEPTING FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WHICH IS WHAT THE NORWEGIANS AND THE SWISS HAVE THEIR ANSWER AS YOU KNOW IS THAT WE GET MORE TRADE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WE WOULD NOT BE CHAINING OURSELVES TO THE Y. QUARTZ WHICH IS CURRENTLY GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER AS THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD ECONOMY ECONOMIC GROWTH
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT STOPS US FROM SELLING GOODS AND SERVICES TO OTHER PARTS THE WORLD LOOK AT GERMANY FOR EXAMPLE GERMANY HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND EX EXPORTING ENGINEERING MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND YET THEY'RE A KEY MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE LONGER THAN WE HAVE MOTHER THINK THEY WERE JUST GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER IT'S THE THING THAT STOPS AS THEY WOULD SAY IS WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE OUR OWN DEALS DESIGNED FOR OUR OWN SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRIES
WITH THE COUNTRIES WE WANT TO PUT WE HAVE TO GET THE AGREEMENT TWENTY SEVEN OF THE COUNTRY TO DO IT FIRST BUT LET LET LET LET LET ME LET ME ANSWER THAT POINT AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE TRADE DEALS WITH ABOUT FIFTY THREE COUNTRIES AS A RESULT OF OUR E.U. MEMBERSHIP IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S FIFTY THREE NEW DEALS WE WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE ANOTHER RELIEVE CAMPAIGN REALLY IN A POSITION TO SAY THEY CAN GUARANTEE WILL BE AS GOOD AS OR BETTER THAN WE'VE GOT AT THE PRO AT THE PRESENT TIME AND YES WE DO NEGOTIATE IZZY IZZY BLOCK
BUT THEN FOR SOMEONE WERE NEGOTIATING WITH AND I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN MINISTERIAL EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU SPOKE SPEAKING TO THE LIKES OF INDIA OR BRAZIL OR CHINA THE FANS THAT IF THEY CAN DO A DEAL THEY GET INTO A MARKET OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AS OPPOSED TO ONLY ONE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS CONSIDERABLY IT COULD BE CONSIDERABLY TO OUR BENEFIT O.K. AND THEN I SUPPOSE MY BIG QUESTION TO THAT THE LEAF CAMPAIGNERS
WHAT IS IT IS IT WILL BE LIKE THE NORWEGIANS THE SWISS IS IT WOULD BE LIKE CANADA OR EVEN ALBINI HAS BEEN MENTIONED FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE OR IF YOU RELY ON THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION THAT WOULD PUT A TOWER OF BARRIER OR A SURCHARGE YOU WOULD LIKE ON BRITISH AND BRITISH EXPORTS AND YES I HAVE HEARD I KNOW YOU YOU'VE GOT PROFESSOR MINFORD THERE AND HE'S ONE OF A VERY SMALL MINORITY BUT HE HAS TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING BRITISH MANUFACTURING HE'S TALKED ABOUT
DEALING WITH THE CAR INDUSTRY IN THE SAME WAY AS HE DOES WANT TO DO WITH HER CORNER INDUSTRY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I THINK IF OUT O.K. LET'S HEAR FROM IF IT'S GOING TO BE BIGGER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING TO BE JOBS GOING YEAH WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT OUR INCOMES OF THE COUNTRY'S INCOME AND THEREFORE OUR OWN INCOMES DROPPED WE OUGHT TO BE TOLD ABOUT IT O.K. THIS WAS A GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN THERE IS NO WAY A POLITICAL PARTY
COULD GET AWAY WITH ALL THESE VAGUE ASSERTION SPENDING PROMISES THAT YOU DON'T STACK UP A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANCER OXYGEN'S TOWARDS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT THE LOT IF YOU WERE I WAS DARLING IS AS WELL NO I DON'T THINK I WANT TO PUT TO YOU JUST BEFORE WE LET YOU GO PROFESSOR MINFORD THERE IS THE CHALLENGE CAN YOU TO SPELL OUT WHAT A NEW TRADING RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE IF WE LEFT YES WELL WE HAVE ACTUALLY AND WHAT WE'VE HAD FROM THE CONSENSUS IS
FRAUDULENT CALCULATIONS ABOUT BRECHT'S POLICIES THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN LET LET ON SO WHAT YOU SAY WOULD HAPPEN RATHER THAN ATTACKING EXACTLY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS THE RIGHT AN OPTIMAL POLICY FOR THE U.K. IF IT AND THAT GIVES US GAINS AS TO GLOAT TO GLOBAL GLOBAL FREE TRADE AND THEN WE DON'T NEED ANY OF THESE DEALS THAT ALISTAIR YOU KNOW HAS A FINE CHANCER AND HIS TIME
HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE DEALS WE HAVE TO MAKE IF YOU GO TO GLOBAL FREE TRADE NEW ZEALAND AT THIS AT THE END OF THE EIGHTIES MADE THEIR ECONOMY MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL WE ABANDON PROTECTIONISM HE TALKS IN HIS GLOWING THAT'S WHAT GLOBAL FREE TRADE IS A TERRIBLY NICE FOR HIS LET'S JUST HEAR WHAT GLOBAL FREE TRADE ME REALITY YOU MIGHT SAY TO THE EUROPEANS WE WON'T CHARGE YOU TARIFFS BUT THEY MAY WELL SAY TO ASK WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT WE WILL CHARGE YOU TARIFFS AND UNDER W.T.O. RULES THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO DO SO
INDEED IT'S COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY THERE WOULD BE TARIFFS ON BRITISH GOODS GOING INTO EUROPEAN MARKET THAT'S CERTAINLY WORD AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ABOUT LEAVING THE E.U. WE FACE THEIR EXTERNAL TARIFFS BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT ALL THEIR EXTERNAL TARIFFS ON THE REST OF THE WORLD WE TRADE FREELY WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT OUR EXPORTERS NOW TRADE
AS AMERICA DOES NOT AS JAPAN DOES WITH HERE YOU FACING THEIR EXTERNAL TARIQ'S O.K. AND WE THEN GET RID OF ALL THE IDIOTS PROTECTIONISM AND ALL THE STUFF WE BUY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH IS NEAR NOT WHAT ABOUT THIS IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING DOESN'T IT LET ME FINISH ALISTAIR BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN ALL YOUR CALCULATIONS YOU SEE VERY CLEVER STUFF AND THE CONSENSUS OF ALL DONE THE SAME THING YOU SAID WILL WE LEAVE THE E.U. AND THEN ALL OUR EXPORTERS WILL BE BADLY HIT BY THESE EXTERNAL
BUT WE WON'T GET RID OF THE OF THE TARIFFS ON THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF LEAVING YOU IS TO FREE OURSELVES OF PROTECTIONISM AND E.U. REGULATION ISM AND YOU HAVEN'T COSTED THAT INTO YOUR CALCULATIONS AND THEN YOU GET A NEGATIVE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY FRAUDULENT BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU SHOULD TELL THE BRITISH PEOPLE IS WHAT HAPPENS ON OUR ASSUMPTIONS WHICH OTHER BEST O.K. AND THEN WHAT IS THE BEST PROFESSOR
WHAT I'VE JUST SAID UNILATERAL FREE TRADE WHAT NEW ZEALAND DID IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHICH WHICH REVIVED ITS ECONOMY WHICH IS PRETTY MORIBUND AT THAT POINT ALISTAIR DARLING QUICKLY IF YOU WOULD YES I KNOW BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE PATRICK MINFORD AS COMING FROM THAT HE WANTS A FREE TRADE BUT IF YOU REMOVE ALL PREPPED FOR PROTECTION OR TERRORISTS IT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE BRITISH CAR INDUSTRY OR THE STEEL INDUSTRY WHICH HAS BEEN SO MUCH IN THE NEWS OVER THE LAST THE LAST FEW WEEKS
THERE'S HIS VIEW AND I SUSPECT TO GO FURTHER IN THE SEAS HE WANTS SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEREGULATION WHAT LET LET ME CLARIFY THAT WAS IT BECAUSE YOU ONLY WORK AS PROTECTION AND SO ON IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A WORLD THAT I WANT AND NOR IS IT A WORLD ACTUALLY THAT MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES LEAVE CAMPAIGNER REPAIRED TO CONFESS WHAT HE'S EFFECTIVELY SETTING FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REMEMBER HERE'S YOUR MARGARET THATCHER'S OLD ADVISER YOU'RE THAT GUY WANTS THAT SCRAP TARIFF SCRAP REGULATIONS
SCRAP WORK PROTECTION SURE YOU WANT TO LEAVE BUT IT'S NOT A WORLD THAT MANY VOTERS WANT TO EMBRACE ONE NINETY TWO PER CENT OF BRITISH VOTERS ARE AN UNPROTECTED SECTORS AND YOU SHOULD ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT'S MY POINT TO ALL THESE CONSENTS TREASURY GIVE THE PEOPLE THE FACTS ABOUT THIS ALTERNATIVE AND THEN JUDGE BECAUSE ACTUALLY
WE CAN DEAL WITH THE STEEL INDUSTRY OUTSIDE WE CAN HAVE ANTI DUMPING JUDITH I THINK WE CAN HAVE A DEAL WITH YOU ABOUT THE CAR INDUSTRY I'M JUST ASKING KNEW THE FACTS OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU ARE SAYING ARE YOU NOT YES WE COULD HAVE A BETTER FUTURE BUT ONLY IF WE FOLLOW AN ARCH THATCHERITE APPROACH OF SLASHING PROTECTION SLASHING REGULATION SLASHING TARIFFS NOT OUCH THAT'S RIGHT IT'S ROD HAD BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS ACTUALLY
BUT MAKING BRITAIN A SUCCESSFUL ECONOMY UNDER FREE MARKETS AND I'M JUST SAYING LET'S DO THE SAME AND GET OUT OF THE E.U. WHICH IS A PROTECTIONIST ANTI FREE MARKET ORGANISATION ALISTAIR DARLING A BRIEF FINAL ONE IF YOU WOULD WE'VE HEARD FROM THE HEAD OF THE GYM BE TODAY THAT YOUR PARTY IS TAKING VERY HALF HEARTED APPROACH AND ISN'T DISCUSSING THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE SHOWN YOU JUST WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FROM SOMETHING PEOPLE DESPERATELY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
I THINK I THINK THAT THE G.N.P. IS QUITE RIGHT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF THIS THERE'S A REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES AN ORATION TO PROTECTION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS PROTECTION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY AND BY THE WAY HER ECONOMY HAS BEEN DOING WELL OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE'S BEEN DOING WELL EQUALLY IN RELATION TO TWO IMMIGRATION YES WE IT IS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE DISCUSSED THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING
WHY FOR EXAMPLE FOR LEAVE CAMPAIGN WILL SEE THAT WE SHOULD BE LIKE NORWAY OR SWITZERLAND WILL HE NOT THEN EXCEPT THAT PART OF THE DEAL THERE IS THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE FORGIVE US HE'S GOING TO BE MANY OTHER CHOICES TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SHEET A NEW A NEW AGREEMENT OVER OVER CARS AS OF SUCH A THING WAS POSSIBLE AND ISOLATION THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES AS I DO THIS DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION AS WELL AS ABOUT THE ECONOMY BUT FOR GOODNESS SAKE WE CAN'T GO INTO SOMETHING
BIGGER THAN ANY GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN BUT FRANKLY THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING TO END UP IT IS TRULY TAKING A LEAP INTO THE DARK I THINK IAN PETRIT THREE BACK TO CLAIM MORE TIME MEDFORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE IN THE STUDIO ALISTAIR DARLING FROM EDINBURGH
SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE AND TALKING ABOUT ECONOMIC MELTDOWN WELL TRY VENEZUELA IT IS GOING THROUGH AND I AND HOW IT HAS THE LARGEST PROVEN OIL RESERVES OF ANY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET AND ON PAPER IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS BUT IT'S NOT IT'S ON ITS KNEES IT'S SO BAD THAT FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE BEGINNING TO PULL OUT NOW SO THAT THINGS WILL GET EVEN WORSE WHEN I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT IT WELL KNOWN VENEZUELAN JOURNALIST RONALDO TROM BETTER A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WHY IS IT WHERE IT IS WELL THE COUNTRY'S IMPLODING BASICALLY
IT'S GOT THE HIGHEST INFLATION IN THE WORLD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED PERCENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO THE I AM THAT'S REALLY FUNNY MONEY DOESN'T IT YES WHAT'S EVEN FUNNIER AS THEY'RE VERY INFLATION WOULD BE WORSE IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT RAN OUT OF MONEY TO PRINT MORE MONEY
SO THAT WOULD EVEN MAKE IT WORSE WORLD IT'S GOT THE HIGHEST RATE OF SHORTAGES IT'S GOT EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT OF SORTS
YOU'LL BUY TOILET ROLLS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW FORGET ABOUT TIGHT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT MEDICINES WERE TALKING ABOUT FOOD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE DYING ABOUT ONE OR TWO KIDS DYING EVERY SINGLE WEEK BECAUSE OF THAT AND THIS HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE WHAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT HAPPENED FOR MANY YEARS CHARVIS DECIDED AND I AM RESIDENT DECIDED THAT HE WOULD EXPLORE PIT HE WHAT NATIONALISED COMPANIES
SO THEY COMPLETELY KILLED THE CAPACITY OF THE COUNTRY TO PRODUCE MEDICINES AND FOOD WHAT HAPPENED THEY IT'S AN EXPORTING COUNTRY NINETY SIX PERCENT OF ITS INCOME COMES FROM OIL WHEN THEY HAD GOOD OIL PRICES WHEN THEY HAD GOOD OIL PRODUCTION IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS MANAGEABLE
NOW THE OIL PRICES DOWN THE CURSE OF THE SAME PROBLEMS OF MISMANAGEMENT AND CORRUPTION THEY CAN'T EVEN PRODUCE THE AMOUNT OF OIL THAT THEY WERE BEFORE AND NOW THE COUNTRY IS TWO STEPS AWAY FROM A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS REALLY SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO START GOING HUNGRY PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY PEOPLE ARE DYING THERE'S HUNDREDS OF A FEW WARRANTS DYING IN HOSPITALS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MEDICINE FOR THEM WHAT'S TO BE DONE
WELL THERE IS A SOLUTION THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM WE SOW THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHO GO TRAVIS WENT THROUGH IT AND HE HE WON AND HE WAS O.K. WITH IT BUT NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER PRESIDENT AND HE'S NOT THAT O.K. WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE YEAR WE HAD ELECTIONS FOR PARLIAMENT TWO THIRDS OF THE PARLIAMENT WENT TO THE OPPOSITION
AND EVERY SINGLE LATHA THEY HAVE APPROVED HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BY HIS RIGHT WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE THEN WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP GOING TO BE WELL YESTERDAY THE ORGANISATION OF AMERICAN STATES THE YES WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS AND THAT
THEY'RE CALLING FOR DIALOGUE ABOUT THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING A REFERENDUM KNOCKED THE WHOLE TWO THIRDS OF OF THE MAJORITY THAT THEY NEED TO TO PASTA
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WON'T BE A REFERENDUM IT'S THE TRUTH EVERY SINGLE STEP THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS IT NEEDS TO DO THEY'VE DONE IT AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION THEY BLOCK IT AND THEY BLOCK AT THEY BLOCK IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THE REFERENDUM ED'S AND BENT UP
HAPPENING IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR OR EVEN LATER THE PRESIDENT QUITS BUT THE CURRENT GOES TO THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ANOTHER THREE DISHES SOME VERY QUICK SENTENCE IF YOU WOULD IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WHAT I THINK WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS THAT EVERYBODY IS WATCHING THIS HAPPEN NOBODY'S DOING NOTHING FEEL WERE YES THEY HAD NOTHING AND I SEE PEOPLE I SEE FOR EXAMPLE BRITISH PETROLEUM DOING BUSINESS WITH VENEZUELA I SEE THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT NOT DOING ANYTHING NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SO I DON'T LIKE WELL I SEE LABOUR LEADERSHIP WHO SUPPORTED ALTHOUGH CHARVIS AND WHO SAID THAT
THEIR MAIN CONCERN WAS THE WELL BEING OF THE VENISON AND PEOPLE WHERE ARE THEY NOW WHY ARE THEY SO SILENT I SEE THE GUARDIAN THE GUARDIAN ALWAYS ST SPEAKING ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU GO TRAVIS WANTS AND NOW THEY'RE SO SILENT THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE SOLUTION IS GOING TO COME FROM OUTSIDE SPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PENCIL GOVERNMENT TESTS PROVEN
THAT THEY DON'T CARE THEY'RE WAS BUT AT LEAST DO THE RIGHT THING AT LEAST SAY SOMETHING AT LEAST MAKE THE VENICE OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT SOMEBODY CARES ABOUT THEM WE'RE NOT A DRUM BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE PAUL SIMON HAS ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SONGBOOKS IN POP MUSIC BUT HE'S NOT RESTING ON HIS LAURELS HE'S TWELFTH SOLO ALBUM STRANGER TO STRANGER COMES OUT THIS WEEK AND HE FINDS THE MUSICIAN EXPLORING THEMES OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE AGEING AND DEATH HE SPOKE TO B. B. C. MUSIC'S MARK SAVAGE ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE RECORD
AS HE APPROACHES HIS SEVENTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY PAUL SIMON IS FEELING CONTENTED YEAH BREATHE HERE
IT'S JUST I HARDLY ENOUGH THE OLDER YOU GET AND I THINK UNTIL YOU GET REALLY OLD I THINK THE HAPPIER YOU AGAIN AND I CERTAINLY THINK HE GETS MORE ORDER WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE AND LOVEJOY YOU TEND TO TURN YOUR ATTENTION TOWARDS THE JOY BECAUSE A SANDERS AS A CONSTANT ANYWAY SO I MEAN WHY YOU KNOW DELIVER IT AS A GIFT TO SOMEBODY ELSE HERE TAKE MY SADNESS ALISON LISTEN TO IT FOR A BACON I WOULDN'T DO THAT
MADE OF PLEASE
THAT JOY AND HUMOROUS SPREADS ACROSS THE STARS NEW ALBUM STRANGER TO STRANGER PROPELLED BY SHUFFLING FLAMENCO RHYTHMS AND RUBBER BAND LINES
HE SPENT FOUR YEARS MAKING THE RECORD OBSESSING OVER EVERY DETAIL AWARE BUT HE'S OLDER HITS SAD A VERY HIGH BAR I HAVE TO THINK TO MYSELF THERE'S A WORLD REALLY NEED TO HEAR THIS WE'RE OR AM I JUST WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME AYE AYE I'LL SING A SONG MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE I GET THE VOCAL THAT I WARRANT
ELLE I RE WRITE SONGS NIGHT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO MAKE THEM MORE COMMERCIAL BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT IS UNSATISFYING TO ME MY THOUGHT IS ALWAYS THERE THE EAR GOES TO THE IRRITANT DO YOU STILL WORRY ABOUT RIDING THE SORT OF CHORUS THAT WILL GET ON THE RADIO AND STICK IN PEOPLE'S HEADS NO I DON'T CONSCIOUSLY RIGHT A
I WAS VERY GOOD AT WRITING BOOKS FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE RIDING BY
MY INTEREST IN HOOKS IS LESS THAN IT USED TO BE
TAKE A CHORUS THAT'S HOOKY AND DO IT TWICE WHEREAS LIKE A PUB SOMEONE WILL DO IT FORWARD
THAT IS THE FIRST SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM IS CALLED WRISTBAND IT STARTS OFF AS A STORY OF A ROCK STAR WHO GETS LOCKED OUT OF HIS OWN CONCERT BUT BY THE THIRD VERSE IT BECOMES AN ALLEGORY FOR THE SOCIAL DIVIDE IN AMERICA
NO IRISH NO
ALONE IN THIS PART NOW SPAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW ENORMOUSLY IN THEIR PUDDING
PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR HOW THEY'RE FEELING WILL MANIFEST ITSELF
I'M NOT SURE BUT IT'S POWERFUL ENOUGH THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE FRIGHTENED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THE POTENTIAL
WITH THAT RAGED TO EXPLODE IN A WAY THEN THERE'S ENORMOUS DAMAGE O.K.
PAUL SIMON TALKING TO MIKE SAVAGE MUCH MORE OF IT ON THE B.B.C. WEBSITE NINE MINUTES TO NINE EUROPE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT PARTY SPLIT OR TEARING THE TORY PARTY APART NOW OF COURSE AS IT DID LABOUR IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES NOT SO THE SCOTTISH NATIONALISTS WE ALWAYS THOUGHT AFTER THEY SWITCHED FROM OPPOSITION TO WHAT WAS THEN THE COMMON MARKET
TO EMBRACING Y. YOU BUT LATER TODAY A NEW GROUP IS GOING TO BE LAUNCHED CALLED S.N.P. LEAVE AND IT PRETTY MUCH DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN BUT LET'S LEARN MORE FROM SCOTLAND EDITOR SARAH SMITH WHO JOINS US IN GLASGOW A NEW GROUP SARAH BUT A PRETTY SMALL ONE OF SPLINTER GROUP
THE GROUP MIGHT BE BUT YOU COULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN PAUL SUGGEST AROUND A THIRD OF S.N.P. SUPPORTERS ARE PLANNING TO VOTE TO LEAVE EVEN THOUGH THE PARTY LEADERSHIP IS ENTIRELY UNITED IN WANTING A VAULT TO REMAIN AND THE S. AND P. ARE USUALLY FAMOUSLY LOYAL TO THE LEADERSHIP
BUT A SIZEABLE CHUNK WANT TO LEAVE AND THE S. AND P. AND I WAS SO POPULAR IN SCOTLAND BUT IF A THIRD OF THEIR SUPPORTERS ARE VOTING TO LEAVE THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THE ELECTORATE
THEY BELIEVE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN FIGHTING TO BE INDEPENDENT OF WESTMINSTER IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE BEING DEPENDENT ON BRUSSELS THEY THINK IT'S LOGICALLY INCONSISTENT TO WANT TO LEAVE THE UNION WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM WAS WANTING TO REMAIN INSIDE THE UNION WITH EUROPE THEY DON'T BELIEVE AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND IF THAT EVER HAPPENS WOULD BE TRULY INDEPENDENT IF IT WAS STILL PART OF THE E.U. AND HAVING TO ABIDE BY THEIR RULES
THERE IS AN INTERESTING LEGAL POINT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE DEVOLUTION LEGISLATION HAS WRITTEN SOME OF THE POWERS THAT WOULD COME BACK TO THE U.K. IF THERE WERE TO BE A BREAKS IT WOULD NOT GO TO WESTMINSTER THEY WILL GO STRAIGHT TO THE HOLYROOD PARLIAMENT IN EDINBURGH EFFECTIVELY INTO THE HANDS OF S.N.P. MINISTERS THAT'S THE POINT MADE BY JIM CILLA'S HE'S A FORMER DEPUTY LEADER OF THE S.N.P. AND ONE OF THE VERY FEW HIGH PROFILE NATIONALIST PERSONALITIES IS CAMPAIGNING FOR A LEAVE
THE U.K. LEAVES THE E.U. CONTROL OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES MORE REVEILLE UP NOT TO WESTMINSTER BUT TO THE HOLYROOD PARLIAMENT SO WE HAD LIKE THEY END UP
WITH THE DREAM OF THE SAME PLEASE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THAT WE'RE NOT END THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY AND WE HAVE ONCE AGAIN CONTROL OF THESE VAST WARTHOG HAS FIRST GO AT SCOTTISH FISHERIES INDUSTRY AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE S.N.P.
WHICH HAS CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE DOESN'T WANT TO SEIZE THAT OPPORTUNITY THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THERE ARE THAT MANY S.N.P. SUPPORTERS MIGHT WANT TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVOKE ANOTHER REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE IS THERE ALSO TEMPTING SOME VOTERS
AS YOU KNOW AND THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON HAS SAID THAT IF THE U.K. AS A WHOLE VOTES TO LEAVE BUT SCOTLAND VOTES TO REMAIN A SITUATION SHE DESCRIBES A SCOTLAND BEING DRAGGED OUT AGAINST ITS WILL THAT COULD PROVOKE A SECOND REFERENDUM ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF INDEPENDENCE PORTERS WHO ARE VERY EAGER FOR ANOTHER VOTE BUT NICOLA STURGEON HAS WARNED THEM DON'T VOTE TO LEAVE TO TRY AND PROVOKE THAT BECAUSE THE SCENARIO ONLY WORKS OF SCOTLAND VOTES TO REMAIN
AND THE TRUTH IS THE S. M. P. REALLY DO NOT WANT TO BE FORCED INTO HOLDING ANOTHER REFERENDUM THAT SOON THEY DON'T THINK THE TIMING WOULD BE A SPACIOUS OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICULARLY ADVANTAGEOUS HUMS A USE IF HE'S A PROMINENT M. S. P. IN THE S.N.P. AND HE'S THE CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR OF S.N.P. IN EUROPE
I WOULDN'T LIKE THIS AND ADDED TO PLAY OUT OF IT LIKE IT'S GOT TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE REST OF THE U.K. HAD TO DRAG IT SCOTLAND OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL PRECIPITATE I DEMAND FORSAKEN REFERENDUM I DON'T DO THAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ISN'T IT A REFERENDUM IN AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND
LOOK THE PEOPLE THE SABLE ANOTHER EFFORT AND OF COURSE CONSORT I DON'T WANT A REFERENDUM AND OR CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK IT MAKES THE ARGUMENT FOR INDEPENDENCE THERE VERY DIFFICULT AS WELL MEAN I THINK HER PRESENTS US WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTIES AND SOME ADDITIONAL CHARGES THE S.N.P. SUMS OR USE A FAIR TALKING TO SARAH SMITH THANK YOU
WHEN WORLD LEADERS TALK PRIVATELY BE PROBABLY LIKE TO THINK IT'S ALL PRETTY HIGH FLOWN STUFF BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY DO TALK FRANKLY ABOUT THE FRUSTRATIONS OF THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF B.B.C.'S GAINED AN EXCLUSIVE INSIGHT INTO ONE OF THOSE RELATIONS BETWEEN JOHN MAJOR AND GEORGE BUSH SENIOR WHEN THEY WERE PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT AND MARTIN ROSE AND BRMS THE MAN WHO GOT HOLD OF THIS STUFF HE'S THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION SPECIALIST AND HE'S WITH THE JAMES DALE IS ARE PUT BACK SCOOBY POLITICAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR USED TO BE POLITICS ANYWAY
AND HE WAS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LOBBY DURING THOSE MAJOR YEARS MARTIN ARE FLAVOUR OF THE SORT OF STUFF THEY USED TO SAY TO EACH OTHER OR ONE THING THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR FROM THESE TRANSCRIPTS CONVERSATIONS IS THAT NEITHER OF THEM SEEM TO LIKE CAMPAIGNING THEY TALK ABOUT HOW ELECTIONEERING WAS MISERABLE CROWDS WERE HORRENDOUS JOHN MAJOR SAYS HE DID WALKABOUTS THAT TURNED REALLY UGLY AND THEY COMMISERATE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS UNPLEASANT PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THEMSELVES RE ELECTED IT WAS HER FAVOURITE THE LETTERS THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN THEM
AS WELL AS THAT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT SOMEHOW OUT OF THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE TO GET WORLD LEADERS OTHER WORLD LEADERS ON SIDE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE THINGS THEY WANT IN THE UNITED NATIONS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THEY TALK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE IS FRANCE FRANCOIS MITTERRAND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT AT THE TIME AND THEY THINK THAT HE WAS A LOGICAL OR MIFFED AND GRUMPY AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS HOW
WORLD LEADERS TALK PRIVATELY ABOUT OTHER WORLD LEADERS WHO THEY NEED TO GET SUPPORT FROM IN A WAY THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT PUBLICLY AND HOW THEY TRY AND MANIPULATE THEM IN A WAY IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SUPPORT TO JOHN MAJOR DIDN'T LIKE THE PRESS HE HE DIDN'T AND I HAVE TO SAY HE DIDN'T SEEM VERY KEEN ON THE B. B. C. I KNOW HE TOLD GEORGE BUSH THAT THE B. B. C. WAS APPALLING
IT'S MEANT TO BE A PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTER BUT IT'S NOT AT ALL IMPARTIAL BUT HE ALSO DIDN'T LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS HE COMPLAINED THAT THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS WEREN'T REPORTING HIS POLICY SO THOSE THAT ACTUALLY I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH FAMILIAR THINGS OF THE SORT THAT WE DO HERE FOUND OUT WHAT'S THIS FELLA LOVE LETTER WELL JOHN MAJOR MADE A VERY SUPPORTIVE SPEECH FOR GEORGE BUSH AFTER BUSH WAS DEFEATED BY CLINTON HE SAID WHAT A WONDERFUL PROTO PRESIDENT HE'D BEEN
AND GEORGE BUSH SAID TO JOHN MAJOR AND ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT OF I SENT YOU A LOVE LETTER OF YESTERDAY HAVE YOU RECEIVED IT YET SWEET SIR JOHN MAJOR SAYS I HAVEN'T GOT IT YET CARD NO JAMES I SUPPOSE BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU WERE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY LOBBY GROUP DURING THOSE MAJOR YEARS THE IDEA OF SHARING YOUR KIND OF LONELINESS I SUPPOSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE AND AWAY WASN'T IT
EXACTLY I THINK ONCE YOU'RE AN ELECTABLE OF LADY YOU'RE PART OF A SHARED CLUB WHATEVER DIFFERENCES THERE MAYBE BETWEEN YOUR NATION'S YOU ARE ALL PART OF THAT ELITE GROUP AND YOU KNOW THEREFORE THAT THE PRESSURES THAT YOU'RE UNDER THE LONELINESS OF THE JOB THE DEMOCRATIC PRECIOUS AND SO I THINK WHEN LEADERS GET TOGETHER THAT'S WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY CAN TALK ABOUT YOU REMINDS ME OF THE
AT THE TIME BUT HER BOSOM IS TALK ABOUT THE IMPORT OF STEAMED QUEEN KNICKERS HE SAID HE'S THE ONE MEETING HAS A WEEK WHERE IT'S WITH SOMEONE HE DOESN'T WANT HIS JOB AND IT WON'T LEAK THAT'S BUT THAT'S THE MODEL HERE YEAH EXACTLY OTHER FRUSTRATIONS AS WELL
OH ABSOLUTELY IF YOU REMEMBER AT THE TIME NUMBER TEN WAS UNDER SIEGE JOHN MAJOR HAD A DECLINING MAJORITY BACK TO BASICS SKETCH SEX SCANDALS THE SLEAZE OF CASH FOR QUESTIONS HIS STAFF WERE RUNNING AROUND DOWNING STREET HIDING THE NEWSPAPERS FROM HIM IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT HE WANTED AT LEAST SOME SOLACE AND THEY GOT THAT IN THOSE EXCHANGES OR ALL OF US ALL LEADERS AT THE SAME AND AWAY ARE THEY YET THEY DO I'M THIS PRESIDENT FOR THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARGARET THATCHER AND RONALD REAGAN
BUT ALSO BLAIR AND MARGARET THATCHER HAD THIS CURIOUS RELATIONSHIP TO THEY THEY HAD SECRET MEETINGS WHEN TONY BLAIR TOOK OVER SO THAT THE LONELINESS OF THE TOP JOB YOU GET WHATEVER HELP AND ADVICE YOU CAN WHETHER IT'S FROM OVERSEAS OR AT HOME THAT'S A LOT OF WORK FOR YOU STILL TO DO MARTIN KEEP BEAVERING AWAY WITH THOSE F.I.A.
