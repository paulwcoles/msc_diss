LOOKING INTO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEAL THAT THE E.U. IS ABOUT TO STRIKE WITH TURKEY OR THAT THEY USE THE DEAL THAT'S ABOUT TO COME INTO EFFECT AT THE END OF JUNE BETWEEN THE E.U. AND TURKEY THAT WOULD ALLOW TURKISH CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO ENTER THE SHOWING AND ZONE FOR UP TO NINETY DAYS AT A TIME WITH BIOMETRIC PASSPORT IT'S CONDITIONAL ON THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT PASSING KEY ANTI CORRUPTION AND TERRORISM REFORMS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT'S IN A EUROPEAN COMMISSION REPORT THAT ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT DEAL WOULD RESULT IN THE INCREASED MOBILITY INTO THE SHOWING AN AREA OF CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS WHO ARE CITIZENS OF TURKEY ALL WHO ARE FOREIGNERS BASED IN TURKEY BRITAIN IS OF COURSE OUTSIDE THE SHOWING IN ZONE BUT THE PAPER ALSO PICKS UP ON COMMENTS ARE MADE ON THE B. B. C. YESTERDAY BY SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE THE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX WHOSE WARNED THAT THE DECISION TO GIVE TURKEY VISA FREE TRAVEL IS PERVERSE AND IN HIS FEW COMPARABLE TO STORY GASOLINE NEXT TO HER
THE GUARDIAN LEADS WITH THE STORY THE SAYS AN AIR QUALITY REPORT THAT WAS NOT PUBLISHED BY BORIS JOHNSON WHEN HE WAS THE MAYOR OF LONDON DEMONSTRATES THAT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE SCHOOLS IN LONDON ARE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT EXCEED EUROPEAN UNION LIMITS FOR NITROGEN DIOXIDE POLLUTION AND FOUR FIFTHS OF THOSE ARE IN DEPRIVED AREAS SPOKESWOMAN FOR MISTER JOHNSON SUCCESSORS SO HE CAN'T THE NEW MAYOR COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PUBLISHED
COS IT WAS COMPLETED MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO MY SAID MY JOHNSON HAD TURNED THE CITY INTO A LAUGHING STOCK ON AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE HE'D BEEN TOO SLOW TO ACT IN IT IN SAID HE'D BE EXPANDING THE SIZE OF THE PLANNED IT CLEAN IS TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH MANY OF THE PAPERS OR PICK UP ON COMMENTS MADE BY SIR MICHAEL WILSHAW THE
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF OF OF STARED ABOUT THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN BEING HIDDEN FOR THE AUTHORITIES IN ILLEGAL SCHOOLS HE SAID INSPECTORS WHO TARGETED SMALL UNREGISTERED SCHOOLS WHICH WERE PREDOMINANTLY ISLAMIC SAYS THE TIMES FOUND PUPIL'S BEEN TAUGHT IN DANGEROUS PREMISES BY ADULTS WITH NO CLEARANCE TO WORK WITH CHILDREN THIS IS THE LEAD STORY FOR THE EYES SAYS THAT INVESTIGATORS WERE DEEPLY ALARMED BY WHAT THEY FOUND
AND US MICHAEL WARNED THAT THE SUBSTANDARD EDUCATION IN MANY UNREGISTERED SCHOOLS UNDERMINED GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS PROMOTE BRITISH VALUES AND THE STORY FRONT PAGE THE TELEGRAPH SAYS GOING TO CHURCH MEANS YOU'LL LIVE LONGER LEASE IF YOU'RE WINNING
REMEMBER MEN BUT THEY DONE AN ANALYSIS OF DATED CHARTING THE LIVES OF MORE THAN SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND WOMEN OVER SIXTEEN YEAR PERIOD AND THEY FOUND THE MOST REGULAR CHURCHGOERS WERE THIRTY THREE PERCENT LESS LIKELY TO DIE DURING THAT TIME THAN THOSE WHO NEVER WENT TO CHURCH
ALBUMEN THOUGH WHO SHOULD BE TOLD
THAT I WAS ELEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX PARLIAMENT IN TURKEY WILL NEED TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CRITICS SAY AMONGST THROUGH ANOTHER ASSAULT ON THE KURDISH POPULATION MARKL OWEN IS A TURKEY CORRESPONDENT THESE IN ISTANBUL IN WHAT SENSE MARK
JOHN THEY ARE DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT TO LIFT THE IMMUNITY OF THE M.P.S IN PARLIAMENT NOW THIS COULD BE LEVELLED AGAINST THREE DIFFERENT PARTIES BUT HE'S SEEN AS PREDOMINANTLY AN ATTEMPT TO PUSH CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE PROBE KURDISH PARTY HERE THE H. D. P. MANY OF ITS M.P.S ARE FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR ALLEGEDLY SUPPORTING TERROR OR BEING PART OF A TERRORIST ORGANISATION MADDY'S THE P.K.K. THE KURDISH MILITANT GROUP
AND THIS IS SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO LEVEL THESE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE PARTY AGAINST THE PRO KURDISH PARTY AND ULTIMATELY TO FORCE PERHAPS UP TO DOZENS OF EAR OF THIS PARTY'S M.P.S FROM PARLIAMENT AND THAT WOULD BE AN ATTEMPT TO BASICALLY PUSHED FORWARD TO A NEW ELECTION POSSIBLY IN THE AUTUMN IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE HIS POWERS
BY INCREASING THE PARTY REPRESENTATION WHICH THAT THAT HE THAT HE THAT HE NEEDS THAT HE REPRESENTS THE THE THE THE GUNS A.K.A. PEAS IT IS IT HAS BEEN HUGELY CRITICISED BY THE KURDISH PARTY BUT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE HER M.P.S ACCOUNTABLE LIKE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY ANY REACTION TO WHAT SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT GIVING TURKEY VISA FREE TRAVEL STORING GASOLINE NEXT TO THE FIRE AS HE PUT IT
THERE HASN'T BEEN A REACTION THAT I DON'T THINK WILL BEAT US TO JOHN BECAUSE BECAUSE TURKEY DOESN'T REALLY SORT OF TAKE MUCH ATTENTION TAKE MUCH NOTE OF THESE KINDS OF COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE FROM OUTSIDE BUT IT IS SEEN AS ANOTHER CRITICISM OF THE DEAL COULD BE STRUCK BETWEEN YOU AND TURKEY TO GIVE TURKS VISA FREE TRAVEL TO THE ZONE AND THAT DEAL SHOULD COME INTO PLACE AT THE END OF JUNE IF TURKEY COMPLIES WITH THE REMAINING CRITERIA BUT ACTUALLY THERE IS STILL A BIG STUMBLING BLOCK
AND THAT IS THAT THE E.U. WAS DEMANDING THAT TURKEY CHANGE ITS ANTI TERROR LEGISLATION TO STOP USING THE WORD TERRORISM TO LASH OUT AT CRITICS INCLUDING JOURNALISTS AND INCLUDING THESE PRO KURDISH M.P.S E. YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS USING THE WORD TERRORISM TO STIFLE DISSENT PRESENT
IT HAS BEEN QUITE FORTHRIGHT AND IN SAYING THAT HE WILL NOT CHANGE THAT ANTI TERROR LEGISLATION THAT TURKEY FACES MULTIPLE TERROR THREATS AND HE SAID QUITE NOTABLY ABOUT A WEEK AGO LOOK THAT EUROPEAN UNION YOU GO YOUR WAY AND WE WILL GO HOURS IF THAT IS THE CASE JOHN AND TURKEY DOES NOT AMEND IT'S ANTI TERROR LEGISLATION THAT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OR SIMPLY NOT VOTE ON THAT DEAL AT THE END OF JUNE AND THEN THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL FOR TURKS WILL REMAIN IN THE DISTANT FUTURE SO IT IS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE AIR BUT IF IT DOES GO FORWARD IF IT DOES HAPPEN THERE WILL BE CONCERNS IN EUROPE
BUT BEAR IN MIND JOHN THAT IF TURKS GET THIS WHEEZE IF WE TRAVEL TO THE SHAMANS ONLY ONLY GIVES THEM A TOURIST'S SAY OF UP TO NINETY DAYS IT DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO WORK IN THE SHETLANDS OWN IT DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO SEEK SOCIAL BENEFITS AND OF COURSE REMEMBER BRITAIN IS NOT PART OF THE SHAMAN'S OWN SO TURKS WON'T BE COMING ANYWHERE TOWARDS BRITAIN THANKS MARK
THE TIMES FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX A LARGE SECURITY OPERATION IS UNDERWAY IN HONG KONG FOR THE VISIT OF THE SENIOR CHINESE POLITICIAN IN CHARGE OF THE TERRITORY'S AFFAIRS JULIANA LOSE OUR CORRESPONDENT IN HONG KONG WHAT DO THE AUTHORITIES FEAR MIGHT HAPPEN JULIANNA
THEY SAID OVER THE WEEKEND OF THAT THERE WERE CREDIBLE THREATS OF INTERNATIONAL AND AS WELL AS LOCALLY GROWN THOSE EXACTS WORDS THAT WERE USED LOCALLY GROWN TERRORISM DURING THE STRIP AND AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT HE IS HERE FOR THREE DAYS ARE SENSIBLY TO ATTEND ECONOMIC CONFERENCE BUT THE ENTIRE TRIP HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THAT MASSIVE SECURITY OPERATION
AS WELL AS A LOOMING PROTESTS BY PRO DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATORS TWO WEEKS AGO WE DAYS WEEKS BEFORE HE CAME WORKERS WERE SEEN GLOWING DOWN PAVING STONES OUTSIDE HONG KONG'S GOVERNMENT HEADQUARTERS WITNESSES SAID IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT PRISED OUT AND HURLED AT MY AND HIS ENTOURAGE LOCAL MEDIA SAYS THAT OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS THERE WILL BE SIX THOUSAND POLICE OFFICERS ON DUTY
AND ALSO DRONES HAVE BEEN BANNED DURING THE VISIT SO AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS SECURITY OPERATION THAT POLITICAL ACTIVISTS SAY IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE NO OPTION HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO GET CLOSE TO MY TO SHUT THEIR SLOGANS OR TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE NEED FOR GREATER DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS FOR HONG KONG RESIDENTS BUT THEY TELL ME THEY STILL INTEND TO PROTEST AND THAT
THEY WILL INTEND TO PROTEST IN JUST A FEW HOURS THE SORT OF FEELING THAT BROUGHT PEOPLE OUT ONTO THE STREETS BEFORE WE SAW ALL THOSE THOSE RUB THOSE PROTESTS THAT THAT THAT SORT OF ANTI CHINESE GOVERNMENT FEELING IS STILL VERY MUCH THERE IS IT
IT'S STILL VERY MUCH THERE I THINK THE MOVEMENT IS LOOKING FOR DIRECTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOSE VERY EXTENDED PROTEST TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WERE ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT TO DO BEYOND GOING OUT ONTO THE STREETS AND FOR THAT REASON I'M NOT EXPECTING A SIMILAR SCALE OF STREET LED PROTEST BUT CERTAINLY
TONIGHT THERE WILL BE A GROUP THERE WILL BE GATHERING IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF HONG KONG AND MARCHING UP TO THE GOVERNMENT HEADQUARTERS OR I SHOULD SAY GOVERNMENT HOUSE WHERE MY WILL BE HAVING DINNER WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND TOMORROW MORNING I'VE HAD A DIFFERENT GROUP WILL BE READING A SEPARATE PROTEST TO THE ONE SHY DISTRICT SHALL BE DELIVERING A SPEECH
AH THAT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY HE'S HERE AND BOTH GROUPS WILL TRY TO BREAK THROUGH THAT SECURITY CORDON TO TRY TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH ESSENTIALLY TO BE ABLE TO TO MAKE THEIR SLOGANS AND MAKE THEIR DEMANDS HEARD JULIANNA LOU THANK YOU
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX WHERE IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR CURRENT ACCOUNT PROG BUBBLY ROB WITH ONE OF THE BIG FOUR BANKS AND THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IN THE WHOLE BANKING SECTOR THAT'S RIGHT YES THREE QUARTERS OF US HAVE A CURRENT ACCOUNT WITH ONE OF THE BIG FOUR BANKS DESPITE THE EMERGENCE IN RECENT YEARS OF THE NEWER SO CALLED CHALLENGER BANKS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT WE COULD EAT UP TO TWO HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR IF WE SWITCHED PROVIDER BUT LAST YEAR ONLY THREE
THREE PER CENT OF US SWITCHED WILL LATER THIS MORNING THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY WILL TELL THE BANKS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO TRY TO FIX THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL AND BUSINESS ACCOUNTS PUBLISHED AN ACTION PLAN IN OCTOBER BUT WAS CRITICISED FOR NOT BEING BOLD ENOUGH OR WITH US IS SAIRA'S ARDALAN THE CHAIRMAN OF OAK NORTH ONE OF THE NEW CHALLENGER BANKS WHICH SPECIALISES IN THE BUSINESS MARKET GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY DON'T PEOPLE SWITCH ACCOUNT
A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH LACK OF TRANSPARENCY PEOPLE NOT REALLY KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT IT'S COSTING THEM TO BORROW MONEY FROM BANKS IN THE SERVICES THEY ARE GETTING SOME OF IT IS INERTIA AND ALSO THE BENEFITS OF THE INCUMBENT SIMPLY HAVING BEEN THERE PEOPLE HAVING A LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM IS ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE ON SWITCH INTO TO THE LIKES OF YOUR BANK IS THERE PERHAPS THEY THEY DON'T KNOW YOU AND TRUST IS EVERYTHING WHEN YOU WERE CONSIDERING WHO TO LEAVE YOUR MONEY
PART OF IT MAY BE THAT IT ALSO I THINK THAT THE REALLY TO ASPECTS OF THIS ONE IS IN NEED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE SERVICES ARE WHAT IT'S COSTING TO GET IT'S A QUESTION OF PRICE AND THE OTHER IT'S ALSO PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS OR ESIN HE'S PARTICULARLY THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT THEY NEED IN THE CASE OF THE CHALLENGER BANK SUCH AS OURSELVES
WHAT WE PROVIDE IS MADE BESPOKE LENDING PRODUCT WHICH IS NOT TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY THE LARGE CLEARING BANKS BECAUSE THESE TYPE OF BESPOKE PRODUCTS REQUIRE QUITE A LOT OF THEIR VERY LABOUR INTENSIVE IN PROVIDING THEM ET-CETERA RIGHT SO WHAT OF THE COMPETITION MARKETS AUTHORITY BE TELLING THE BIG BANKS THEY HAVE TO DO
I THINK ON ONE SIDE THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY AND INERTIA OR THROUGH A PRICE COMPARISON SITE CAN I THINK BE QUITE HELPFUL TO BE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PROPERLY ON THE OTHER SIDE WE NEED TO TO HAVE THE C.M.E. ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE BANKING SECTOR AND YOU KNOW LICKING THEM SO WE GET ME NEW AN ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF SERVICES TO PARTICULARLY S.M.E.S TO MEET SPECIFIC NEEDS WE DO HAVE MORE BANKS BEING CREATED THE COMPETITION A MARKET AUTHORITY HAS ALREADY SUGGESTED THIS KIND OF PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITE SO IS THAT IT IS THAT ALL THEY HAVE TO DO
IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE BANKING SYSTEM I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF ISSUES WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PROPORTIONAL REGULATION WE NEED TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW SETTING UP BANKS AND ALSO WE NEED TO GET THE A C.M.A. AND OTHERS TO PROMOTE AND NUDGE
EXISTING USERS WHO SUFFER FROM INERTIA TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AND ADDITION TO THEIR EXISTING THANKING RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S PERHAPS ALL DOWN TO US THEN OH KAY SORRY TIDELAND CHAIRMAN THANK YOU WELL THAT ARE MARKET GUESS THIS MORNING IS JUST GROUND THE U.K. EQUITIES FUND MANAGER AT TRADERS MORNING JESSICA HARDING ON ON THE THE BIG BANKS LISTED ON THE STOCK MARKET DO INVESTOR SEE THIS C.M.A. ENQUIRY IS A THREAT TO THEIR MARKET SHARE OR NOT REALLY
I THINK INVESTORS HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT THE REGULARS WOULD LIKE TO SEE COMPETITION FOR A VERY LONG TIME SOME OF THE BIGGER THREAT SO THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT IS THE IMPACT OF OF LOW INTEREST RATES AND HOW BANKS ARE GOING TO GET DOWN AND ARE COSTS SO WE'VE ALSO HAD A LOT OF SOME OF THE REMEDIES AROUND COMPETITION WITH
ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND HAVING TO SPIT OUT SOME ASSETS AND LLOYD'S HAVING TO SPEND OUT THIS ASSETS SO COMPARED TO WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED BREAK AT BANKS AND SOME OF THE LONGER TERM HEAD WINS I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE AS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE C.M.A. COMES OUT THERE TODAY NOT THE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL INVESTOR WARREN BUFFETT KNOWN TO HIS FOLLOWERS AS THE ORACLE OF OMAHA HAS TAKEN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR STEAK
IN APPLE YET THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER APPLES BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND IT SO WHY DO YOU THINK MY BUFFET HAS PLOUGHED IN SUCH A HUGE SUM OF MONEY IT'S SO INTERESTING COS WARM BUFFET'S GONE ON RECORD IN THE PAST AT SAYING YOU KNOW I FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO VALUE TECH COMPANIES AND HERE HE IS BUYING THE BIGGEST TECH COMPANY MISTAKEN THE BIGGEST TECH CAMP IN THE WORLD I THINK TWO THINGS WILL HAVE APPEALED TO HIM ONE WE KNOW WARREN BUFFETT LIKES COMPANIES WITH REALLY STRONG BALANCE SHEETS AND OBVIOUSLY APPLE'S GOT A LOT OF CASH ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET
AND TO WARM BUFFET HE'S HE'S ALWAYS INVEST IN THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY STRONG CONSUMER BRAND SO HE'S BEEN A HUGE SUPPORT OF THE LIKES OF COCA COLA AND I SUSPECT IT APPLE HE'S SEEING THAT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS A STRONG BRAND
AND THE BALANCE SHEET AND HE'S LESS WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THEIR SHORTER TERM HEAD WINS IN TERMS OF WE CRY PHONE SALES AND HE'LL BE MUCH MORE LOOKING TOWARDS LONG TERM PROSPECTS OH KAY LET'S TALK LONG TERM ABOUT THE PRICE OF OIL AND IT IS NOW CLOSE TO FIFTY DOLLARS A BARREL THE PRICE OF OIL'S BEEN RISING PRETTY RAPIDLY IN RECENT WEEKS WHY I THINK YOU KNOW
OIL OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN PRETTY HAD A PRETTY DRAMATIC FALLS AT THE START OF THIS YEAR AND ACTUALLY WE SAW SUPPLY RESPONDING SOMETHING PARTICULAR U. S. GAS GAS THERE'S BEEN A LOT LESS SUPPLY OF THAT COMING ON AND SO THE MARKET HAS BECOME QUITE TIGHT AND SO NOW WHEN WE'VE HAD SOME WITH THE LATEST ATTACKS IN NIGERIA IT'S MEANT THAT THE THEIR CUT PRICE HAS RESPONDED QUITE QUICKLY SO IT'S SORT OF FUNCTIONING AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IN RESPONSE TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND SO IT IS THE ONLY WAY UP THEN FOR THE OIL PRICE
I CERTAINLY THINK THAT LOT LONGER TERM PRICES AROUND THE FIFTY DOLLAR MARK LOOK LOOK MORE SUSTAINABLE SOME OF SOME OF THE LEVELS AROUND THIRTY FIVE JUST MEANT THAT INVESTMENT WAS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN
AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED WE'VE ALL THOUGHT ABOUT LYRA GLOBAL GROWTH BUT ON OUR ESTIMATES THE DEMAND FOR ALL HAND EXACTLY PHONE OFF A CLIFF ALL RIGHT THANK YOU JESSICA JESSICA AROUND THERE FROM SCHROEDER'S NOW AT BRITAIN'S BANKS ARE FAILING TO TAKE THREAT FROM CYBERSPACE SERIOUSLY ENOUGH THAT IS ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE BANKS THEMSELVES AN INDUSTRY BODY THE CITY YOU KAY SAYS ONLINE CRIME IS A REAL AND PRESENT DANGER AND ONE'S FINANCIAL COMPANIES ARE ON THE FRONTLINE WITH US AS A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CITY YOU KATE CHRIS CUMMINS MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW BIG IS THIS WRECK
THE THREAT HAS GONE FROM A NICHE ISSUED TO BEING TWO ONE NATIONAL SECURITY PROBLEM OVER THE LAST DECADE LAST YEAR IT COST BRITISH BUSINESS IN THE ORDER OF THIRTY FOUR BILLION POUNDS AND NINETY PER CENT OF MAJOR COMPANIES REPORTED THAT THEY'D EITHER COME UNDER THREAT COME UNDER ATTACK OR INDEED HAD A BREACH JUST LAST YEAR SO THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WHAT KIND OF OF ATTACKS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ARE THEY RELATIVELY MINOR ONES WHICH CAN BE REPELLED VERY EASILY WITH A BIT OF SOFTWARE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INTRUSIONS WHERE SYSTEMS OR DATA WAS COMPROMISED
IT COVERS A SPECTRUM FROM INDIVIDUAL ACTIVISTS THREW TOO ORGANISED AND CRIMINAL GANGS AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE A LOT OF THE ISSUES LIKE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE RECOGNISE THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST A TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION IT STARTS WITH PEOPLE
IN FACT GETTING CYBER HYGIENE RIGHT WITHIN BUSINESS IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO STOPPER TO STOPPING CYBER ATTACKS IN FUTURE GIVEN WE KNOW THAT THE POTENTIAL COSTS TO BUSINESS AND SAW THE TALKTALK BREACH LAST YEAR ISN'T IT RATHER WORRYING THAT THE BANKS AREN'T TAKING IT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH
I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ACTUALLY ACROSS FINANCIAL SERVICES THERE'S A WILLINGNESS NOW TO DO A GREAT DEAL MORE TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND ACTUALLY WHERE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY CAN WORK MUCH MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER IN FACT IN THE U.K. OUR GOVERNMENT AND THE CHANCELLOR IN PARTICULAR HAS SHOWN REAL LEADERSHIP
THE CHANCELLOR FOUND AN EXTRA ONE POINT NINE BILLION POUNDS FOR CYBER STRATEGY AND THE REPORT WE PUBLISHED TODAY SETS OUT ON A TEN POINT PLAN SHOWING WHERE INDUSTRY REGULATOR AND GOVERNMENT CAN WORK TOGETHER GIVEN THAT THE THREAT OF THE CYBER ATTACKS HAS BEEN RISING IN RECENT YEARS WE KNOW THAT THE CITY'S I.T. SYSTEMS ARE CREAKING AT THE SEAMS ISN'T THE ANSWER PRETTY SIMPLE THAT BANKS HAVE JUST GOT TO PUT THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKET AND SPEND AN AWFUL LOT ON BOB BEEFING UP THEIR I.T. SYSTEMS
THE BANKS ARE MAJOR INVESTORS IN I.T. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT ACTUALLY SOME REALLY SIMPLE STEPS NOT ONLY FOR THE BANKS TO TAKE BUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPLIERS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANISATIONS IT'S REALLY A CASE OF HOW U.K. P.L.C. GETS
LET'S MATCH THAT RESPONDS TO THE NEW AND RAPIDLY GROWING THREATS FROM INTERNATIONAL CYBER CRIME AND INDEED STATE ACTORS AND THAT'S WHY GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY SOLUTION TO PROTECT THE BRITISH PUBLIC IS THE SOLUTION WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD TODAY SO UNIQUE WHAT YOU WHEN YOU SAY GOVERNMENT HELPED HIM IN GOVERNMENT MONEY
NOT NOT JUST GOVERNMENT MONEY THIS IS A WAY OF INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER SO HAVING LAWS POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY AND ACTUALLY THE U.K.'S ALREADY ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS A LEADER IN FIGHTING CYBER CRIME
IT'S ONLY RECENTLY THAT THAT GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THE NEW NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY CENTRE AND IT'S BY WORKING WITH INDUSTRY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN CYBER ISSUES O.K.

THE B. B. C. USED TO REMOVE MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND RECIPES FROM ITS WEBSITE AS PART OF A REVIEW OF THE CORPORATIONS ONLINE OUTPUT IT'S UNDERSTOOD THIS FORMS PART OF A PLAN TO CUT FIFTEEN MILLION POUNDS FROM THE WEBSITE BUDGET AS THE CORPORATION FOCUSES ON DISTINCTIVE PUBLIC SERVICE CONTENT THE B.

TWENTY FOREIGN MINISTERS ARE MEETING IN VIENNA TO DISCUSS WAYS OF STRENGTHENING THE FRAGILE TRUCE IN SYRIA THE INTERNATIONAL SERIOUS SUPPORT GROUP INCLUDES THE U.S. RUSSIA THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ARAB STATES THE GROUP IS HOPING TO SEE PROGRESS ON HUMANITARIAN ACCESS
A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN WHO FREQUENTLY ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES LIVE LONGER THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT THE RESEARCHERS FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY SO THAT ATTENDING CHURCH SEEMS TO INCREASE SOCIAL SUPPORT AND HELP DEVELOP A HOPEFUL OUTLOOK ON LIFE
THE AUTHORITIES IN THAILAND ARE SET TO CLOSE THE ISLAND OF KO TOUCH I SING HIGH LEVELS OF TOURISM ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE ENVIRONMENT EXPERT SEE ONE BEACH ON TOUCH CHAI COULD HOLD ABOUT SEVENTY PEOPLE BUT SOMETIMES THERE WERE WELL OVER A THOUSAND TOURISTS ON IT
THE DRIVERS ARE TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN TURKEY AND ITS AMBITION TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ON THE REFERENDUM AGENDA TODAY NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR WHY NO ONE THIS IS BECAUSE OF REMARKS BY THE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE WHO PAINTS A VERY DARK VISION OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF MASS MIGRATION INTO EUROPE WHICH SHE SAYS BRITAIN CANNOT BE IMMUNE FROM
HIS ARGUMENT IS BASICALLY THIS THAT THE CURRENT LEVELS OF MIGRATION ARE A THREAT IN EFFECT TO THE E.U. ITSELF IT IS A SORT OF EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE WHICH IN HIS VIEW IS EATING AWAY AT THE WILLINGNESS OF E.U. STATES
TO WORK TOGETHER SECONDLY THE DECISION TO ALLOW TURKS VISA FREE ACCESS IN EXCHANGE FOR HELPING OUT IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS HE SAYS IT'S LIKE STORING GASOLINE NEXT THE FIRE WILL SIMPLY EXACERBATE
WHAT HE IDENTIFIES AS A A SEA CHANGE IN THE Y. YOU WORRY TALKS ABOUT A POPULIST UPRISING WHERE PEOPLE FEEL THEIR CULTURE AND IDENTITY IS UNDER CHALLENGE BECAUSE OF THIS MASS MIGRATION INTO THE Y. U. WHICH WILL LEAD TO HE SUGGEST THE EMERGENCE OF FAR RIGHT PARTIES IN THE BREAK UP OF THE E.U. AND BRITAIN HE ARGUES CANNOT BE IMMUNE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE AN OPT OUT FROM
THE SHANG AN AREA BECAUSE ONCE MIGRANTS COME INTO THE E.U. THEY BECOME SETTLED IN THE E.U. THEN IN TIME THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO MOVE FREELY WITHIN THE E.U. INCLUDING TO BRITAIN RIGHT SO THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT THAT THE ARGUMENT COS WE'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE ABOUT TURKEY EVENTUALLY JOINING EUROPE
IT'S IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT ACTUALLY JOHN I MEAN CLEARLY HE HAS DEEP DEEP RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF GIVING TURKS VISA FREE ACCESS AND WHAT THAT MIGHT ENTAIL BUT ACTUALLY IT IS A BIGGER ARGUMENT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL MIGRATION AND WHAT THAT WILL DO TO EUROPE NOW CLEARLY TURKEY PLAYS INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN
SORT OF IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE A SORT OF IT HASN'T REALLY BUBBLED TO THE SURFACE BUT IT IS THERE BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TURKS WERE ALLOWED A VISA FREE ACCESS THEN
BUT THAT IS A VERY VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MISTER CAMERON DELIBERATELY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DOUSE DOWN THAT FEAR WHEN HE APPEARED BEFORE THE LIAISON COMMITTEE OF M.P.S JUST THE OTHER WEEK SAYING LOOK IT'S NOT TURKISH ACCESS IS NOT REMOTELY ON THE CARDS IT'S NOT AN ISSUE FOR DECADES ACTUALLY SIR RICHARD SEEMS TO BE SAYING YES TURKEY IS AN ISSUE BUT MORE THAN THAT MIGRATION IS SO HUGE INTO THE E.U. THAT IT THREATENS BRITAIN EVEN THOUGH WE DO HAVE AN OPT OUT IS THE WRECKS IT CAMP GOING TO MAKE
A LOT OF USE OF THIS OVER THE COMING WEEKS I AM THINK INEVITABLY I MEAN NIGEL FARRAJ HAS ALREADY PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED THAT QUOTES A VOTE TO REMAIN AS A VOTE FOR TURKEY IT HAS LONG BEEN THEIR VIEW THAT REGAINING CONTROL OF BORDERS AS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL
TO THEIR CASE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF CURBING THE NUMBERS BUT IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON PUBLIC SERVICES ON WAGES ON PAY IT IS AN ABSOLUTE CENTRAL PLANK OF THEIR CAMPAIGN SO INEVITABLY I'M SURE THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY SEIZE ON SIR RICHARD'S COMMENTS THANKS NORMAN
TIMES TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF SOUTHERN HEALTH IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH TRUSTS IN ENGLAND AND IT'S BEEN UNDER FIRE FOR MONTHS OVER A SERIES OF CARE FAILINGS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED PATIENTS DIED UNEXPECTEDLY WHILE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRUST A GOVERNORS' MEETING TODAY MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE REMOVAL OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE BUT IT WAS CANCELLED WILL TALK TO ONE OF THE GOVERNORS IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST MICHAEL BUCHANAN A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT WHY WAS THAT MEETING CANCELLED MICHAEL
THIS ISN'T A COUNSELLOR WAS TAKEN BY THE NEW CHAIRMAN TIM SMART IT WAS IMPOSED ON THE TRUST BY THE REGULATOR N.H.S. IMPROVEMENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ESSENTIALLY HE HAS DECIDED THAT TO HOLD THE MEETING WOULD HAVE LED TO AN HIS FEW LEGAL CHALLENGES HE BELIEVES THAT SOME OF THE MANAGERS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED IN SOME OF THE RESOLUTIONS THEY WERE DUE TO BE DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING THIS THIS MORNING THEY COULD WELL HAVE TAKEN A JUDICIAL REVIEW OVER
THE CONDUCT OF THE MEETING ON THE FACT THAT THE MEETING WAS HELD AT ALL BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEIR OWN DEFENCE TO THE GOVERNESS AND SO HE HE SAID THAT HE HAS DECIDED TO COUNSEL YOU SEE HE'S HE'S GOING TO AND KNOWS THE OUTCOME OF A REVIEW HE'S CARRYING IT HIMSELF INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST WITHIN FOUR TO SIX WEEKS AND WHAT DO YOU SEE IT IS HE DID NOT NEED TO JUDICIAL REVIEW HANGING OVER THEM TO PREVENT THEM FROM CARRYING OUT THE NECESSARY CHANGES THAT HE THINKS
OUT OF THAT IF YOU HE'S TAKEN PLACE HOWEVER AS YOU INDICATED SOME OF THEIR GOVERNESS I GOING TO MEET ANNA WE HAD TO HAVE A DISCUSSION THIS MORNING AND SEPARATE TO THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER MEETING IN HAMPSHIRE TODAY OF A GROUP OF FAMILIES HAVE FEW OF THEIR LOVED ONES IN PARTICULAR WERE LET DOWN BY THE TRUST OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THEY'RE HAVING A MEETING AS WELL
OF THEMSELVES TO DISCUSS HOW TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON THE TRUST AND IN PARTICULAR IT'S A BOTTLE CHIEF EXECUTIVE KATRINA PERSON AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE CRITICISM OF THE TRUST DOES SEEM TO BE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE QUALITY OF ITS LEADERSHIP
THE QUALITY OF HIS LEADERSHIP MANAGEMENT AND ITS GOVERNMENT SIZE DOES BUT HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF OFF SUSTAINED CRITICISM FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS THERE WAS A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY N.H.S. ENGLAND THERE WAS PUBLISHED JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS THAT PHONE
OF THE TRUST AND FEEL TO INVESTIGATE THE UNEXPECTED DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ON THE REASON THE REPORTS SAY THAT HAD HAPPENED WAS BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE TRUST BUT THAT LED TO A C. Q. C. INSPECTION OF THE REGULATOR COMING IN AND HAVING A LOOK AT THE TRUST AGAIN IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THIS YEAR AND THEIR REPORT WHICH CAME OUT JUST LAST MONTH AT THE END OF APRIL BIT AGAIN PHONED CLEAR FEELINGS AND PROBLEMS WITH PATIENT SAFETY AT THE TRUST AND AGAIN AT SAY THE REASON THEY WERE TAKING PLACE
WAS BECAUSE OF POOR LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST NONETHELESS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE KATRINA PERCY HAS STEADFASTLY REFUSED TO RESIGN SHE SEIZED AT HER JOB THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT PERIOD AS TO PROVIDE THE TRUST WITH THE LEADERSHIP THAT IT REQUIRES MICHAEL THANK YOU WERE LISTENING TO THAT IS PETER BELL HE'S ONE OF THE PUBLIC GOVERNORS UP SOUTHERN HEALTH TRUST GOOD MORNING
COME ON THIS IS THE CHAIRMAN WRONG TOO TO WANT ANOTHER FOUR TO SIX WEEKS TO CONDUCT HIS OWN REVIEW BEFORE MAKING A DECISION ON THIS
I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CHAIRMAN IS ONLY JUST COMING TO POST HAVING TIME TO CONDUCT HIS REVIEW BUT I DO THINK IT'S WRONG OF HIM TO STOP THE GOVERNORS FROM MEETING SO WE COULD EXPRESS OUR VIEW SUGGESTION AT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR LEGAL CHALLENGE I THINK YOUR SPURIOUS THE
MOTIONS WHICH WOULD BEFORE THE GOVERNORS WE'VE ALREADY AGREED TO MEANT TO REMOVE THE POTENTIAL THE LEGAL CHALLENGE AND ALL WE CAN DO IT'S GOVERNORS IS TO EXPRESS A VIEW WE HAVE NO LEGAL POWERS UPSET BUT AT THE END OF A PROCEDURE WE CAN DISMISS NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS THAT'S THE ONLY REAL POWERS WE HAVE
AND WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO DO THAT TODAY WE'VE AMENDED THE RESOLUTIONS TO SIMPLY START THE PROCESS OF HAVING A REPORT PRODUCED TO SAY WHETHER THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT IS IT WHAT IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE KATRINA PERCY SHOULD
IT LOOKS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME FOR HER TO REMAIN IN POST GIVEN ALL THE CRITICISMS AND GETTING THAT THIS TRUST NEEDS PUBLIC SUPPORT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME ON MY OWN TO EXPRESS A VIEW I WANT TO HEAR THE VIEWS OF THE PATIENTS THE PUBLIC
THE OTHER THE GOVERNORS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COME TO A REASONED CONCLUSIONS AND I'VE NOT YET HEARD THAT DEBATE BUT YOU HAVE HEARD SOME OF THE VIEWS OF THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN WELL INCLUDING SOME OF THE PATIENTS WHO'VE LOST THEIR LIVES FOR EXAMPLE CON A SPARROWHAWK WHO DROWNED IN A BATH AT A SOUTHERN TRUST FACILITY AFTER HE HAD A SEIZURE
AND I'M MEETING THE FAMILY OF CONNOR SPARROWHAWK THIS MORNING AS I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DO TO GO AND LISTEN TO THEM LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS BECAUSE THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNESS IS TO GO AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS OF THE PUBLIC AND TO CONSIDER THAT AND TO TAKE THAT BACK AND TO USE THEIR POWERS TO CHALLENGE THE BOARD TO SAY ARE YOU DOING THE RIGHT THING
PETER BELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AND THANK YOU ALSO TO MICHAEL BUCHANAN EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS ARE WARNING THAT THEY COULD BE SITTING DUCKS IN THE EVENT OF A SERIOUS ATTACK BY TERRORISTS SHOWS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SPECIFICALLY POLICE OFFICERS IN RURAL AREAS NOT THE BIG CITIES SO MUCH
YES THAT'S RIGHT THE THE PICTURE ON THIS JOHN IS THAT THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS OFFICERS IN ENGLAND AND WALES AS FALL INTO FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THAT IS IN FACT THE LOWEST FOR AROUND THIRTY YEARS ALTHOUGH FIFTEEN HUNDRED MORE ARMED OFFICERS ARE BEING RECRUITED AND TRAINED THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS AND EXPERTS AND POLICE OFFICERS THAT WE'VE SPOKEN TO FOR THE FINAL PROGRAMME
ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT RESPONSE TIMES THEY VARY HUGELY FROM CITY CENTRES TO RURAL AREAS RURAL AND COASTAL AREAS YOU HAVE PARTS OF THE U.K. IS A CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY PLANTS POWER PLANTS THEY ARE SITED AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS AND TERRORISTS HAVE PLOTTED BEFORE TO ATTACK THOSE SITES AND COULD DO SO AGAIN AND THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN ARISES THIS IS JOHN AT THE POLICE FEDERATION REPRESENTATIVE FOR HAMPSHIRE
THEY ARE REALISTIC IF THE FIREARMS UNIT WAS COMING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTY
HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT THIRTY MILES AWAY YOU'RE NOT TALKING A FEW MINUTES THERE'D BE AN UNDERSTANDABLE DELAY AND
THE FIREARMS UNIT IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTY THAT'S ALMOST SEVENTY MILES AWAY SO YOU'RE TALKING A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE SO THE ONLY OFFICES THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE ON ARMED I'M VULNERABLE OFFICES AND THEY'RE THE OFFICERS ARE SAYING TO ME THAT THEY FEEL
IN A. TERRORIST TYPE SITUATION THEY WOULD BE SITTING DUCKS AND DANNY WHY ARE THERE FEWER ARMED OFFICERS KNOW TRAINED ARMED OFFICERS IN THE WORLD
SORRY I MISSED THE QUESTION A BIT JOHN WHY ARE ARE YEAH I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHY ARE THERE YOU SAID THERE ARE FEWER ARMED OFFICERS NOW THAN THERE WERE FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED WHY IS THAT I THINK IT'S A NUMBER OF REASONS I THINK THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS HAS FALLEN GENERALLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS
OH WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GONE DOWN IF WE CAN HEAR YOU KNOW JUST WRITE IT THAT THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS GENERALLY HAS FALLEN OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS BECAUSE OF CUTS TO POLICING BUCKETS AND I THINK THE NUMBER OF ARMED OFFICERS HE'S HAS DWINDLED AS A RESULT OF THAT AT THE RESPONSE FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF'S COUNCIL HAS BEEN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO MOBILISE FIREARMS OFFICERS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE SUPPORT FROM AROUND THREE THOUSAND
FROM THE CIVIL NUCLEAR CONSTABULARY THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE POLICE AND ALSO FROM THE ARMY THEY'RE TELLING US THAT HELICOPTERS FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE USED TO FLY IT POLICE FIREARMS OFFICERS TO THE SEAT OF AN ATTACK THERE WOULD ALSO BE THE POSSIBILITY OF SPECIAL FORCES INVOLVED AND SOLDIERS PATROLLING POTENTIALLY THE STREETS TO OFFER REASSURANCE AND SO ON
AFTER A TERRORIST INCIDENT SO THERE A WELL LAID PLANS THAT THEY SAY IT WOULD MITIGATE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SHORTAGE OF ARMED OFFICERS THANKS DANNY AND FILE ON FOR TONIGHT TONIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON RADIO FOUR A CLOCKS FOR THAT GOT IT THANKS
THE TIMES A QUARTER TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND A DAY AFTER THE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX HAD RICHARD DEARLOVE CRITICISED E.U. PLANS TO OFFER VISA FREE TRAVEL TO TURKISH CITIZENS THE DAILY TELEGRAPH SAYS THE E.U. HAS ADMITTED THAT THE MOVE WILL MAKE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MORE LIKELY THE PAPER QUOTES A EUROPEAN COMMISSION REPORT WHICH SAYS TERRORISTS AND ORGANISED CRIMINALS ARE EXPECTED TO SEEK
TURKISH PASSPORTS AS SOON AS THE VISA WAIVER COMES INTO FORCE THE LAY ILL EXPOSES A PACT BETWEEN DAVID CAMERON AND BIG BUSINESS TO SCARE BRITAIN INTO STAYING IN THE E.U. IT SAYS THAT A LEAKED A LETTER SUGGESTS THE PRIME MINISTER WAS PLOTTING WITH A MULTINATIONAL FIRM ABOUT HOW TO HAMMER HOME THE REMAIN CASE EVEN WHILE HE WAS TELLING M.P.S THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE IF HE'S RENEGOTIATION HAS FAILED THE PAPER CALLS IT DAMMING PROOF THAT MISTER CAMERON WAS A CHARADE
WRITING IN SUPPORT OF THE E.U. IN THE EYE NEWSPAPER SIR IAN MCKELLEN CREDITS IT WITH PLAYING A CRUCIAL ROLE IN PROMOTING LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER RIGHTS IN BRITAIN ACROSS EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD HE COMMENDS ITS FUNDING OF LOCAL GROUPS WHO CAMPAIGN AGAINST HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANS PHOBIC VIOLENCE MANY OF THEM HE SAYS AT GREAT PERSONAL RISKS REPORTER THE TIME MISSUS CRISIS HIT CARE HOMES ARE LEAVING THOUSANDS OF BEDS EMPTY A RECORD NUMBER OF BEDS IN HOMES FOR THE ELDERLY DISAPPEARED LAST YEAR THE TIMES HASN'T ANALYSTS ARE WARNING THAT THE SECTOR
HE'S HEADING FOR A SEVERE CRISIS COUNCILS ARE SAID TO HAVE CUT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY PAID FOR ELDERLY CARE IN RECENT YEARS AND SOME HOMES SAY THEY CAN NO LONGER PROVIDE A SERVICE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOW BEING WARM HE'LL STRUGGLE TO FIND PLACES FOR THE ELDERLY AMERICA THE GUARDIAN HIGHLIGHTS ARE CLAIMED BY THE NEW MAYOR OF LONDON SIDIQUE KHAN BUT HIS PREDECESSOR BORIS JOHNSON BURIED A REPORT ON AIR QUALITY IN THE CAPITAL THE DOCUMENT IS SAID TO SHOW THAT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE SCHOOLS MOST OF THEM DEPRIVED OR IN AREAS WHICH BREACH E.U. LIMITS FOR NITROGEN DIOXIDE
A SPOKESMAN FOR MISTER JOHNSON HAS CALLED THE ACCUSATION RITSA BULLEN SAID HE PUT IN PLACE THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES TO ADDRESS AIR POLLUTION OF ANY MAJOR WORLD CITY GO TO THE MIRROR THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF DODGING A CLAMPDOWN ON BETTING MACHINES AFTER FIGURES REVEAL THAT THE NET THE TAXMEN THIRTEEN MILLION POUNDS A WEEK CONTROVERSIAL FIXED ODDS BETTING TERMINALS DESCRIBED AS THE CRACK COCAINE OF GAMBLING BECAUSE THEY'RE SO ADDICTIVE
I THOUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BULK OF IT GAMBLERS LOSE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION POUNDS A DAY ON THE SYSTEM AS THE MIRROR SAYS A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN TOLD THEM TAX REVENUE DOES NOT DICTATE GAMBLING REGULATION AND FINALLY THE DAILY TELEGRAPH WONDERS IN AN EDITORIAL IF BRIGHTON IS BRITISH THE COUNCIL THERE CAN BE PAINFULLY WRITE ON THE PAPER SAYS SO IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT IT REFUSED TO USE A BIN LORRY THAT WAS EMBLAZONED
WITH THE UNION FLAG BECAUSE SOME RESIDENTS COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS POLITICAL SUCH BEHAVIOUR SUGGESTS THAT A CITY THAT DOES NOT FEEL ENTIRELY HOME IN THIS COUNTRY THE PAPER SAYS PERHAPS BRIGHTON SHOULD HOLD ITS OWN REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE FROM THE U.K. TWELVE MINUTES SUDDENLY NEWS THIS MORNING THE POLICE FEDERATION'S WORE THAT OFFICERS WOULD BE SITTING DUCKS IN THE EVENT OF A TERRORIST ATTACK ON STRATEGIC SITES IN ISOLATED LOCATIONS
WHEN ANGELINA JOLIE PEP SPOKE IN THE RADIO THEATRE HERE BROADCASTING HOUSE YESTERDAY SHE WAS DOING SO IN HER CAPACITY AS SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THE U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES ARE STILL WITHIN THEIR COUNTRY'S BORDERS AND NOT THEREFORE TECHNICALLY REFUGEES
HERE'S WHAT ANGELINA JOLIE PITT SAID WHEN I ASKED ABOUT HOW TODAY'S SENSE OF CRISIS OVER MIGRATION AND REFUGEES COMPARED TO HOW IT WAS WHEN SHE BEGAN VISITING CAMPS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT THERE WERE MANY RETURNS
AND I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE A PART OF MANY OF THOSE RETURNS AND AND
WHEN I WOULD VISIT A REFUGEE CAMP THE FOCUS WAS AND HOW THE FOLKS WAS AND I'M THIRD COUNTRY ASYLUM IT WAS IT WAS ON
TO BOUNCE THIS CAMPAIGN HOW TO GET A SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE CAMP AND HOW TO MEN IN THE APPEALS FOR HAVE THE FUNDS FOR A FOOD NEEDED TO BE TUCKED UP OR SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING YOU WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE DISPLACED PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE OVER THERE WHERE'S MA ORDER THERE WHERE'S MY FUNDING THERE WERE LESS NUMBERS
AND AND NOW IT IS VERY DISTRESSING WHEN I GO TO THESE SITUATIONS IN THESE CAMPS WHERE IT DOESN'T FEEL IN ANY WAY LIKE IT USED TO
WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER BARONESS NICHOLSON FOUNDER AND CHAIR OF THE ARMAGH FOUNDATION WHICH DELIVERS EMERGENCY AID TO INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST MAINLY IN IRAQ A COUNTRY WHICH SHE HAS KNOWN AND BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR MANY YEARS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ARE THE INTERNALLY DISPLACED MUCH HARDER TO READ MORE EASILY FORGOTTEN
THE FIRST PROBLEM WITH BEING ENTIRELY DISPLACED IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE U.N. PROTECTION THERE IS NO CONVENTION LIKE THE REFUGEE CONVENTION WHICH MY JOHNNY PIT WORKS UNDER THAT SUPPORTS INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE SO YOU ARE AS IT WERE NAMELESS FACELESS AND ALMOST IRRELEVANT
AND YES SHE WAY LINED UP IN A CAMP BUT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY ENTITLED THE PROPER U.N. PROTECTION AT ALL AND THEREFORE THE UN MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY ACCESS TO A CAMP LIKE THAT THE U.N. IS LIKED HAD ACCESS BUT NOT ALWAYS I DO KNOW SOME COUNTRIES WHERE THE U.N. HAS NOT HAD ACCESS OR CERTAINLY HASN'T HAD IN A SENSE THE OWNERSHIP EVER THAT IT HAS OF OTHER CAMPS SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
THE SORT OF NAMELESS FACELESS PEOPLE FIFTY SIXTY MILLION OR MORE OF THEM INCIDENTALLY NOT PROPERLY COUNTED NOT LOOKED AFTER NOT LAUGH NOT CARED FOR THESE ARE THE SO CALLED INTERNALLY DISPLACED IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FLEE LIKE THE C.D.S FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME OF THE CHRISTIANS IN IRAQ AND THE OWNS THE OTHER MINORITY FAITHS SO CALLED MINORITY PHASE THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO FLEE BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION SO WHEN YOUR OWN NATION DOES THAT TO YOU
WHO'S GOING TO LOOK AFTER YOU AND YOU'RE STILL INSIDE OR NATION'S BORDERS ANGELINA JOLIE PITT TALKED YESTERDAY AND I KNOW YOU WERE THERE IN THE END THE AUDIENCE TO HEAR HEAR HER SPEAK SHE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DRAWING A LINE BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC MIGRANT AND AND AND THE REFUGEE AND BUT I'M THINKING OF A COUNTRY LIKE IRAQ WHICH YOU'VE KNOWN FOR SUCH A LONG TIME WHERE THE INSTABILITY IS CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR IT WAS SAFER AND THEN YOU HAD THE RISE OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
WELL THIS LINE THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DRAW IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME OR ANYBODY ELSE TO DRAW HOW CAN I TELL HER WHEN I WAS AT A REFUGEE CAMP WILL GO AND TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD A MUCH WORSE CONDITION SQUATTING BEHIND A WALL FOR EXAMPLE FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS ON END HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE BECAUSE THEY WANT A BETTER LIFE OR WHETHER THEY'RE FLEEING BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO FRIGHTENED THAT THEY DAREN'T STAY VERY OFTEN IT'S ALMOST ONE OF THE SAME SO IT'S A VERY TOUGH LINE TO DRAW INDEED
I LIKE TO WORK AS HARD AS POSSIBLE AND I'M A FOUNDATIONS MISSION IS THIS IS TO HELP PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WHY BECAUSE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE HOME AT ALL THEY WERE SAFE AND HAPPY LIFE WHERE THEY ARE THEY WERE TO BRING UP THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR OWN CULTURE IN THE AIR IN THEIR OWN
AS IT WERE WARMTH OR CURLED THEY WANT TO BE THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY I WORK THERE AND I DON'T SEE THIS FIGURE OF ONE PER CENT OF ALL REFUGEES AND I.D.P.S RESETTLED AS INDICATIVE IT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH WE HEARD HE'S QUITE GENEROUS NOT GENEROUS ENOUGH
QUITE GENEROUS NOT EFFICIENT AT THE MONEY DOESN'T GET THROUGH WE DON'T LOOK AFTER PEOPLE PROPERLY NOT FOR WANT OF MONEY BUT FOR WANT OF COMPETENCE AND EFFICIENCY ARE YOU PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO STAY AT HOME ARE YOU SAYING THEREFORE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE MUCH MORE EFFORT TO REACH THOSE IN INTERNALLY DISPLACED CAMP SO THAT THEY IN OUR OWN INTEREST IF YOU LIKE SO THAT THEY DON'T CROSS BORDERS DON'T BECOME REFUGEES FOR THE SAKE OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES WE SHOULD HELP THEM ON THE GROUND ON THE SPOT HELP THEM DELIVER THEIR SKILLS AND TALENTS AND HELP AND HAVE A FUTURE
HELP THEM HAVE TRAINING HELP THEM HAVE EDUCATION AT THE MOMENT HAVE A CHILD GOES INTO A CAMP AT SEVEN IT MAY END UP AT EIGHTEEN ELECTRIC LONG NUMERATE AND KNOWING NOTHING EXCEPT HOW TO CUE THE FOOD IN A CAMP IS SIMPLY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH THE SYSTEM'S NOT WORKING AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD TACKLE BARONESS NICHOLSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME IS SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE'S BEEN A SHARP RISE IN THE NUMBER OF TEENAGERS GETTING SO DRUNK SO OFTEN THAT THEY ARE IN EFFECT POISONING THEMSELVES THAT'S WHAT A REPORT FROM THE ROYAL COLLEGE WAS HARDLY SEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING AFTER LIZ OUGHTON OF NOTTINGHAM UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE REPORTS CO AUTHORS GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING DELIBERATELY POISONING THEMSELVES
WE SIT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT INCREASING AND ALL SORTS OF POISONING THING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT'S INTENTIONAL UNINTENTIONAL AND UP ALCOHOL RELATED POISONING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE THAT WE SEE ACTUALLY IS RELATED TO INTENTIONAL POISONINGS
OVERDOSE FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN YOUNG GIRLS AROUND AGE SIXTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLD RIGHT SO NOT ALCOHOL WE DO SEE AN INCREASE WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN ALCOHOL RELATED POISONINGS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BUT THE BIGGEST INCREASE HAS BEEN AN INTENTIONAL SELF HARM INTENTIONAL POISONINGS SO TAKING WHAT TO DO
GOING TAKEN LOTS OF ASPIRINS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MOSTLY PIRACY TO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE DATA BUT PARIS EATING ALL HIS TENDS TO BE THE MOST COMMON SUBSTANCE AND WOULD THIS BE INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEIR WRISTS OR SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THAT
IN THIS STUDY WE ONLY LOOKED AT POISONINGS BECAUSE PLACINGS ARE ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN IN TEENAGERS BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY WE DIDN'T LOOK AT OTHER FARMS HAVE SELF HARMED BUT WHICH OTHER EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT SELF HARM OF OF THE TIDES IS ALSO INCREASING BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION COS IT WASN'T PART OF YOUR RESEARCH I IMAGINE BUT BUT WHY ARE THEY DOING IT WHY WHY THIS INCREASE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE RIGHT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LOOK AT THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY THIS THIS THIS STUDY WAS BASED ON LOOKING AT G.P. RECORDS SO FROM ONE POINT THREE MILLION ANATOMISED ER G.P. MEDICAL RECORDS SO WE COULDN'T SEE THEY THE CONTEXT OF IT WE CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SELF HARMING BUT
FROM OTHER STUDIES AND FROM FROM UP IN OUT ONTO THE FRONT LINE PRACTITIONERS THEY THEY DO FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN PRESSURE ON YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY ON YOUNG GIRL SOCIAL MEDIA PRESSURES EXAM PRESSURES BODY IMAGE PASHA'S SO THEY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE REASONS WHY BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SHOW THAT FROM THIS PARTICULAR WORK AND I'M SORRY I I WAS GOING TO ASK AS WELL AND CAN YOU BE SURE THAT THOSE WHO
EFFECTIVELY POISON THEMSELVES WITH WITH ALCOHOL AREN'T JUST GETTING DRUNK AND ENJOYING GETTING DRUNK AS TEENAGERS HAVE DONE SINCE TIME BEGAN WE HAVE SUED SO WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE FROM THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR ALCOHOL THAN THAT MAYBE THAT
IT'S BECOMING MORE COMMON TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION AS OPPOSED TO ITS MORE COMMON AND IT'S HAPPENING OVERALL BUT BUT THE THE THE INCREASE IS THAT WE SEE AGAIN TEND TO BE IN A PARTICULAR SUB GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE SO GIRLS IN PARTICULAR WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN ALCOHOL RELATED TO A MEDICAL ATTENTION SO THE FACT THAT WE SEE THAT IN PARTICULAR SUB GROUP SUGGESTS THAT THE PERHAPS MAYBE SOMETHING UNDERLINE MY AND THAT WAS INTERESTING THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GO TO A DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE DRINKING
SO THEY THAT WE LOOKED AT G.P. RECORDS AND G.P.S WILL BE INFORMED ABOUT HOSPITAL ATTENDANCES ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY ATTENDANCES ARE ADMISSIONS INTO HOSPITAL THEY ARE G.P.S ARE INFORMED ABOUT THOSE VISITS AND THEY RECORD THAT IN THE MEDICAL RECORD SO THIS ISN'T JUST THE THEY OCCURRENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO THEIR G.P. TO TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL ALTHOUGH WE DO WE CAN WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT THIS WOULD INCLUDE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY AND I'VE GONE BEEN ADMITTED INTO HOSPITAL AS WELL

THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY HAS JUST PROPOSED REQUIRING BANKS TO SET A MONTHLY MAXIMUM CHARGE FOR UNARRANGED OVERDRAFT ON PERSONAL CURRENT ACCOUNT IT'S BEEN CARRYING OUT AN INQUIRY INTO THE RETAIL BANKING SECTOR
NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S FOLLOW UP ON THAT NOW WHEN IF EVER HAVE YOU CHANGED BANKS ONLY THREE PER CENT OF US DID SO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN NEARLY FORTY PERCENT OF HER STAY WITH THE SAME BANK FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND YET THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY FOUND THAT CURRENT ACCOUNT CUSTOMERS WHO USE THEIR OVERDRAFTS A LOT COULD SAVE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY A YEAR BY SWITCHING TO A BETTER DEAL IT HAS JUST PUBLISHED ITS PROVISIONAL FINDINGS ON THE ISSUE AND WHERE JOINED FROM WESTMINSTER
BY PROFESSOR ALASTAIR SMITH CHAIRMAN OF THE SEA A MAZE RETAIL BANKING INVESTIGATION PANEL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING
WE'RE PROPOSING A WHOLE PACKAGE OF MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE BANKING MARKET IS NOT WALKING WELL FOR CUSTOMERS OFFER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AT THE MOMENT
PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD FOR CUSTOMERS TO WALK OUT WHAT THE BANK REALLY COSTS THEM AND THEREFORE QUID THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE BEST VALUE DEAL FROM A BANK
SO WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING FORWARD IN ORDER TO CHANGE THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD A BIT
PROGRAMME PARTICULARLY OF OF MEASURE ORIENTED AT CUSTOMERS WHO USE OVERDRAFTS BECAUSE OVERDRAFT CHARGES ARE ONE OF THE MOST PROBLEMATIC AREAS AT THAT AT THE MOMENT WE WANT BANKS TO ANNOUNCE WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT ANY CUSTOMER SHOULD PAY FOR IT
AND AN OVERDRAFT IN IF THEY HAVE AN OVERDRAFT IN A MONTH AND WE ALSO WANT BANKS TO GIVE CUSTOMERS A WARNING MESSAGES WHEN THAT GOING INTO OVERDRAFT SO THEY'VE GIVEN MUCH MORE HELP ABOUT CONTROLLING THEY HAD THE USE OF HONOUR ESPECIALLY UNARRANGED OVERDRAFT AND IN CUTTING THEIR EXCESS CHARGES BUT THAT THAT IS
THAT DOESN'T GO ANY WAY TOWARDS HELPING THEM ARE POINTING THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING A BETTER DEAL ELSEWHERE
YES WE ALSO HAVE A PROGRAMME UNDERWAY TO DEVELOP MUCH MUCH BETTER INFORMATION FOR FOUR BANK CUSTOMERS THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME TIME BUT THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS UNDERWAY THERE ARE GOING TO REVOLUTIONISE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HIM TO THANK CUSTOMERS BOTH PASSIONATE CUSTOMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES ANYTHING YOU MEAN IT'S GOING TO GO MUCH FURTHER THAN PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES BECAUSE WHEN IT DID THE PROBLEM WITH THE BASIC PROBLEM WITH BANKING INFORMATION IS THAT THE BEST BANK FOR YOU DEPENDS ON HOW YOU USE YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS ARE LOOKING AT A WEBSITE
CALLED THAT'S NECESSARY TELL YOU WHICH IS THE BEST BANK FOR YOU
WHAT WE NEED IS HIS TECHNOLOGY THAT PUTS TOGETHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR OWN BANK USAGE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT BANK CHARGES AND SHOWS WHERE YOU GOING TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR YOU O.K. SO SO YOU SEEM TO BE RELYING ON TECHNOLOGY GIVING CUSTOMERS THE TOOLS
TO MAKE DECISIONS WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU YOU WERE CALLED UPON TO DO THOUGH WAS WAS TO THINK ABOUT BREAKING UP THE BIG BANKS BECAUSE THE FACT IS THAT THREE QUARTERS OF US HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH ONE OF THE BIG FOUR AND THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT SCENE LOTS OF MURDERERS AND CONSOLIDATION IN RECENT YEARS SO THERE IS SIMPLY LESS CHOICE AROUND
IS A MARKET WITH THREE QUARTERS OF US HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH ONE OF FOUR INSTITUTIONS A MARKET THAT IS WORKING
WE I AGREE THAT THE MARKET IS NOT WORKING BUT WE LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY AT THE ISSUE OF BREAKING UP THE BANKS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS NOT OF THE BANKS ARE TOO BIG THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT CUSTOMERS DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT BANKING PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND SPENDING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A VERY COSTLY PROGRAMME BREAKING UP SOME OF THE BIGGEST BANKS IF WE ENDED UP WITH EIGHT OR NINE
MEDIUM SIZED BANKS THAT STILL WE'RE GIVING THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE CUSTOMERS TO TO ENABLE THEM TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES WOULD NOT GET AS ANY QUID WE ARE LOOKING AT
DOING THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER RIGHT BUT WE ARE LEFT WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT WHILE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE MARKET THE BANKING MARKET IS NOT WORKING WELL IT IS UP TO THE CUSTOMER TO USE TO WORK QUITE HARD ACTUALLY TO GET THE RIGHT KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER IN ORDER TO FIX A BROKEN MARKET A NOWHERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASY FOR CUSTOMERS TO SHOP AROUND TO MAKE IT MUCH EASIER THAN IT IS AT THE MOMENT IT'S NOT CUSTOMERS
WORKING HARD ENOUGH THE BANKS AREN'T WORKING HARD ENOUGH FOR THE CUSTOMERS BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASY FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND NOT JUST FIND THE BEST DEAL FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO TAKE ACTION THAT INSURERS DO NOT HIT WITH EXCESS CHARGES WE WANT TO MAKE THAT EASY FOR CUSTOMERS PROFESSOR ALASTAIR SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ANOTHER FRONT HAS BEEN OPENED IN THE BATTLE OF THE REFERENDUM TURKEY THE FORMER HEAD OF M.I.SIX SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE FIRED A VOLLEY YESTERDAY WHEN HE WARNED ABOUT TURKS BEING ALLOWED TO GET AN E. U. VISA IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM TAKING BACK REFUGEES WHO'D LANDED ILLEGALLY INCREASES HAD ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN WOULD BE LIKE STORING GASOLINE NEXT OF THE FIRE WE ARE TRYING TO EXTINGUISH ALL ON YOUR OWN IS A FORMER
TURKISH AMBASSADOR TO NATO AND HE IS ON THE LINE NOW FROM TURKEY GOOD MORNING TO YOU
MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT SIR RICHARD HAD TO SAY
WELL I BELIEVE THEY'RE PLEASE COMMENCE ROAD QUITE UNFORTUNATE
APPARENTLY HE DOESN'T EXPERIENCE THE DRUGS IN EUROPE I SAGAS TURKISH AMBASSADOR IN GERMANY FOR FIVE YEARS AND I WAS PROUD THAT THEIR ABILITY OFF TURKS TO INTEGRATE TO DRUM SOCIETY AND I WAS REALLY IT'S MY CONTRIBUTIONS TO GERMANY
SORRY YES YES PLEASE WELL MOVED NADAL WHO GO AND RATTLE YOUR WORKERS BUT THEY'RE ALL SURE INVEST
ACTUALLY CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TURKISH COMPANIES IN GERMANY AND THEY EMPLOY THE TO THE MODERN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SAW THEY BRING THEIR REAL CONTRIBUTION TO DRUM AND SOCIETY AND THEY ARE THAT IT WASN'T YOUR SECURITY AT ALL THEY ARE FACING SECURITY THREATS FROM NEO NAZI GROUPS AND THE NUMBER OF TURKS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF OUR SAINT ATTACKS
LIKE THIS GROUPS BUT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THE WORRY THAT THAT SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE WAS EXPRESSING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME TURKS WHO WOULD CHOOSE TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY TO TO TO THIS CONTINENT TO THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES IN THE SHINGLE AREA TO CAUSE MAYHEM THAT IS A POSSIBILITY ISN'T IT
WELL IN THOSE REGARDS PROBABLY A RICHER IT'S A SHOULD NOT KNOW THAT'S THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CO OPERATION BETWEEN TOADIE AND EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES IN THE FIELD OF COMBATING TERRORISM
YEAH TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE HELP FOR THE REPATRIATE IT ALL EUROPEAN TERRORIST IT'S REALLY HANDY TED IN TURKEY
BUT PRACTICALLY ANOTHER SINGLE TURKISH TOURIST DETAINED IN YOU CANTONESE THERE'S BEEN REPATRIATED TO TURKEY SO BEING MADE TO CORPORATE MAURIE TERRITORY IT'S TRUE BUT TO QUALIFY FOR ITS LEVEL OF DRUGS THEY'RE STORING GAZZA LINE NEAR A FIRE IS TOO MUCH
THE TURKS WHO CAME TOUR TO GERMANY TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THEY FACED SOME GROUPS WHO'S TAUGHT GAZZA LYING NEAR A FIRE THEY COME INTO THE HOUSE ON CRIMES THEREFORE YOU SHOULDN'T THAT'S CONSTANT ALL TURKISH AND VISITORS THROUGH EUROPE
HE'S PUT THERE SHALL CRIMINAL DID HAVE GOT OF COURSE NOT BUT THE POINT THAT THE THE CERTAINLY THE BRECK'S IT MADE THOSE WHO WANT US TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION SAY THAT THIS DEAL EFFECTIVELY MAKES TURKEY THE FRONTIER OF EUROPE SO THAT WE NOW HAVE A BORDER WE WOULD EUROPE WOULD EFFECTIVELY HAVE A BORDER WITH SYRIA AND WITH THE RACK AND THAT IS A VERY SILLY THING TO DO IN THESE DANGEROUS TIMES
I BELIEVE THAT IN CASE HE TRIES EUROPEAN UNION EUROPE YOU'LL BE MORE SECURE TURKEY AND ME AS A MEMBER OF YOUR OPINION YOU KNOW MY BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO PROTECT THE EUROPEAN RADHA URSINE EUROPEAN BORDERS IN THERE SAYS THE FAIRY OLDER WORK
ON YOUR HONOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED I THINK SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND THE E.U. REFERENDUM LOOKS LIKELY TO BE THE TOP TALKING POINT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING TODAY OF THE OLDEST AND PERHAPS BEST KNOWN NAME IN INSURANCE ROBBIE ON HAS MORE THAN A BUSINESS
LLOYD'S OF LONDON INSURANCE MARKET HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IT AS WITNESS GREAT CHANGES TO BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD THE RISE OF EMPIRE THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND SO ON AND AT ITS ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING LATER LLOYD'S CHAIRMAN JOHN NELSON WILL TELL ITS MEMBERS THE U.K. SHOULD NOT CHANGE ITS POSITION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND JOHN NELSON IS HERE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOUR POSITION IS CLEAR BRITAIN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION YOUR MARKET DEALS AND RISK SO WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE RISKS OF STAYING IN A BASICALLY COMPLETELY FOR LLOYDS ARE COMPLETELY TRUMPED BY THE THREE MAIN ISSUES SINCE ARE STAYING IN ONE IS THE PAST SPORTING RIGHTS WE HAVE WITHIN EUROPE SECONDLY IS THE FURRED PARTY THIRD COUNTRY TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT THE E.U. HAVE WHICH WE OPERATE UNDER AND THIRDLY FREE FOR LLOYD'S EIGHTY PER CENT OF OUR CAPITAL COMES FROM OUTSIDE
THE U.K. ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS AND INVESTING IN LLOYD'S AS LLOYDS AS PART OF THE E.U. AND THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE U.K. BEING PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY IN EUROPE IN TERMS OF INWARD INVESTMENT BUT WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF STAYING IN PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THE U.K. SHOULD LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS A RISK OF MORE E.U. FINANCIAL REGULATION OF BEING OUTGUNNED BY COUNTRIES THAT USE THE EURO ABSOLUTELY THE FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF THE RISK OF REGULATION THERE ARE
RISK OF REGULATION IN THE SENSE THAT E.U. REGULATION HAS BEEN OVERBEARING IN SOME AREAS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ART LEAVING IF WE DO LEAVE THE E.U. WE WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO CLEAR IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO E.U. REGULATION
AND YOU CAN SEE THIS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES SO FOR PEOPLE TO ASSERT THAT BY LEAVING THE E.U. WE WILL FREE OURSELVES FROM E.U. REGULATION THE IS THAT IS WRONG THE SECOND POINT WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS LLOYD'S IS A BIG INFLUENCE IN TERMS OF E.U. REGULATION AS A MEMBER OF THE E.U. AND WE WOULD LOSE THAT INFLUENCE IF WE IF WE CAME OUT
THE LLOYD'S INSURANCE MARKET HAS SURVIVED SOME OF THOSE GREAT CHANGES WHICH I MENTIONED UNTIL IT WOULD SURVIVE AND THRIVE PRESUMABLY IF BRITAIN LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION LLOYDS OF COURSE WILL SURVIVE WE HAVE CONTINGENCY PLANS IN PLACE IF WE DO LEAVE BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION IT WOULD BE IT WOULD MAKE LIFE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT MUCH MORE INEFFICIENT
WHEN I TRAVEL LLOYD'S IS THE MOST GLOBAL ORGANISATION IN THE U.K. EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE U.K. IN TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WILL DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR EXPORTS AS YOU KNOW FROM THE COUNTRY GO TO TO THE THAT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE AFFECTED O.K. THANK YOU JOHN US ON THE CHAIRMAN OF LLOYD'S OF LONDON
TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S NEARLY THREE MONTHS IN SOME DOG WALKERS MADE AN UNEXPECTED AND UNPLEASANT DISCOVERY IN A PARK IN BATH A SEVERED HUMAN FOOT
EVER SINCE DETECTIVES FROM AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS HIGHLY UNUSUAL CASE A CORRESPONDENT JOHN KAY'S BEEN SPEAKING TO THOSE INVOLVED IN THE ESK INDIA INVESTIGATION AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WE'LL HEAR HOW THEY ARE GETTING ON THIS MORNING WE HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE WHO FOUND THE FOOT
OVER HERE COME ON OLLIE NICKY GEOFFREY'S AND SIMON CLARKE WALK THIS SPANIEL IN WESTON PARK EVERY MORNING
ON THE NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY AT QUARTER TO EIGHT IN THE MORNING THEY FOUND A FOOT HERE NOT JUST BONES AND INTACT SEVERED HUMAN FOOT
AND THERE WAS THIS THING KIND OF ALMOST LIKE IT'S IN A NEST I WAS HORRIBLE SO IT'S IT WASN'T VERY DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY ON TOP OF IT ON TOP OF THE VEGETATION ON THE GROUND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE DURING
CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR ME WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE LOOKED LIKE A MALE FOOT I DON'T KNOW I SAY THAT BUT IT WAS THIN IT WAS LONG AND THERE WAS SKIN
ON THE SOUL OF THE FOOT WHICH WAS QUITE CRINKLED AND CRUMPLED UP ROUND HERE'LL IT HAD BROWN STAINS ON IT WHICH LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
SOMEONE'S FOOT YOU SAY OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A PARK I'D ASSUME IT WAS A PROSTHETIC OR A FANCY DRESS OR FROM HALLOWEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU WERE CONVINCED IT WAS SO
SO REALISTIC POLICE LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION AFTER A SEVERED FOOT IS FOUND IN A PARK BY A DOG WALKER TONIGHT MYSTERY STILL SURROUNDS A DISCOVERY THAT WE'VE STRAIGHTAWAY THIS PARK ON THE NORTH WESTERN SLOPES OF BATH WAS CORDONED OFF BY POLICE
WHO ARE TREATING IT AS A CRIME SCENE AND LOOKING FOR ANY OTHER BODY PARTS THAT MIGHT BE HERE I SHOULD EXPLAIN THE SPOT WHERE THE FOOT WAS FOUND IS JUST BY THE ENTRANCE TO THE PARK ONLY A FEW YARDS FROM THE ROAD FROM THE SCHOOL YOU CAN IMAGINE IF THIS FOOT HAS BEEN HERE FOR SOME CURD A TIME THIS WHOLE DETECTIVE INSPECTOR PAUL CATTON FROM AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE WAS PUT IN CHARGE AND COMPILED A LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS
HOW DID IT BECOME SEVERED FROM THE BODY HOW LONG'S IT BEEN THERE HAS IT BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE COULD I ESTABLISH WHETHER IT WAS A MISSING PERSON
OR SOMEONE WE HAD CONCERNS OVER OVER THEIR SAFETY IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HAVE EXPLAINED BY THE TYPE OF CUT
AND THE TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CAME INTO BEING IN THE PARK WAS IT A JOKE OR IS IT SOMETHING SINISTER THE FIRST PERSON HE CALLED WAS HOME OFFICE PATHOLOGIST DOCTOR RUSSELL DELANEY WHO'S BASED AT THE LOCAL MORTUARY AFTER THE FIRST
BRIEF EXAMINATION IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS IT WAS REAL AND IT WAS IT WAS
WHITE SKINNED WAS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY HOW OLD IT WAS DIFFICULT IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE
FRESH BUT NEITHER DID IT APPEARED TO BE ROTTEN SO IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN DECOMPOSING DISCO
I'VE COME TO BATH'S ROYAL UNITED HOSPITAL THE FOOT WAS FOUND ONLY ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM HERE SO POLICE CHECKED SURGERY RECORDS AND HOW CLINICAL WASTE IS DISPOSED OF BUT THEY'RE CONFIDENT THERE IS NOT A LINK
THEY ALSO WENT TO A NEARBY CEMETERY BUT THEY COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE OF GRAVES BEING DISTURBED
OFFICERS THOUGHT D.N.A. MIGHT GIVE THEM ANSWERS BUT WHEN THE RESULTS CAME BACK HARDLY ANY D.N.A. COULD BE FOUND PATHOLOGIST DOCTOR RUSS DELANEY AGAIN
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THAT THAT EFFECTIVELY KILLED ALL THE D.N.A. THE BODY PART HAS BEEN TREATED IN SOME WAY IT'S HARD TO
ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT HAPPENED SO BACK AT THE PARK THREE MONTHS ON NIKKI AND SIMON STILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
YOU HAVE ENDLESS SERIES IT FELL OUT OF A PLANE WAS ONE THING REALLY IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A MURDER VICTIM WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT PEOPLE
WANT TO FEEL SAFE WE WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE COME UP WITH THESE INCREASINGLY OUTLANDISH IDEAS
GLENDA'S INDEED THAT WAS JOHN KAYE REPORTING THERE AND TOMORROW WE SHALL HEAR FROM SOME OF THE EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER TO TRY TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BATH FOOT BATH FOOT MYSTERY

TWENTY FOREIGN MINISTERS ARE MEETING IN VIENNA TO DISCUSS WAYS OF STRENGTHENING THE FRAGILE TRUCE IN SYRIA THE INTERNATIONAL SERIOUS SUPPORT GROUP INCLUDES THE U.S. RUSSIA THE UNITED KINGDOM AND ARAB STATES
A NEW STUDIES SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WHO FREQUENTLY ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES LIVE LONGER THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT THE RESEARCHERS FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY SO THAT ATTENDING CHURCH SEEMS TO INCREASE SOCIAL SUPPORT AND HELP DEVELOP A HOPEFUL OUTLOOK ON LIFE THE DINERS TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE ARE JUST FIVE WEEKS TO GO TILL THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH MEANS FIVE WEEKS TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHICH WAY TO VOTE IF YOU ARE AS YET UNDECIDED
ALONGSIDE THE GLOBAL MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY CANTAR WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO TWO GROUPS OF UNDECIDED VOTERS FROM THE BEDFORD AREA ABOUT THE ISSUES AND THE LEVEN REMAIN CAMPAIGNS BEFORE WE HEAR FROM DOCTOR MICHELE HARRIS AND GLOBAL HEAD OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AT CANTON HERE'S WHAT THE VOTERS THOUGHT ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE
FOR ME PERSONALLY I KNOW IT SOUNDS A BIT SILLY BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A LIST OF PROS AND CONS AND FOR ME TO MAKE MY OWN MIND UP ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE COMING OUT CONSTANTLY TO BENEFITS
WHAT BUT IF WE STAY IN IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HAD NOT
HE'LL BE BETTER AND I FEEL THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW UNTIL AFTERWARDS BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD TO TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE KNOW AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN
IT TURNS OUT AFTERWARDS THEY NO ONE ACTUALLY KNOWS AT THE MOMENT YOU'VE GOT A FEW POLITICIANS AND ACTUALLY THEY JUST SQUABBLING BETWEEN THEMSELVES INSTEAD TO GIVE PEOPLE THE REAL
SQUABBLING LIKE CHILDREN I THINK WE'RE ALL GROWN UP ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE NEED SOME FACTS OUT THERE I THINK WHEN THE REAL FACTS SENT OUT THERE TO PEOPLE TO MAKE A PROPER DECISION I DO KNOW QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING WE SHOULD LEAVE
OF COURSE YOU'RE HEARING THEM IN ONE HERE YOU'RE HERE IN THE T.V. IN ANOTHER HEIR AND YOU'RE LIKE OH WHAT IF I DO
DOCTOR MICHELLE HARRISON LISTENING TO THAT YOU GET THE STRONG SENSE OF HOW CONFUSING THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDECIDED HOW MUCH THEY SIMPLY WANT THE FACTS YES THAT'S COME THROUGH THROUGH VERY CLEARLY SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BELIEVE SECONDLY THE BACKDROP TO ALL OF THIS IS A LACK OF TRUST IN WHAT POLITICIANS ARE SAYING
THIS IS VERY MUCH IDENTIFIED AS AN ISSUE FOR WESTMINSTER AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST IN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE LISTENING TO AND IN FACT THE INFORMATION BOOKLET THAT WENT THROUGH PEOPLE'S DOORS WE DISCUSSED THAT AND ONLY ONE PERSON FROM THE DISCUSSION GROUPS HAD ACTUALLY PICKED IT UP AND READ IT SO A SENSE THAT EITHER THERE AREN'T FACTS THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE
OR THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE ANSWER IN A WAY WAS THERE A FEELING THAT THIS REFERENDUM HAS BEEN SPRUNG UPON PEOPLE IN IN A PRETTY SHORT SPACE OF TIME I THINK THE CONTEXT FOR THIS REALLY IS THAT
THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY WESTMINSTER RATHER THAN THE ELECTORATE SO IF WE LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN TRACKING FROM CANTAR FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE ASKED PEOPLE WASH OTHER POLICY PRIORITIES THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON WHILE THE LEAST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR THEM WAS THE GOVERNMENT RENEGOTIATING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR OUT
AND SO PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THE TABLE TO DISCUSS THIS AND OFTEN THEY SOUND CONFUSED OR THEY SOUND A LITTLE DISENGAGE NETS BECAUSE IT WASN'T ON THE TOP OF THEIR PRIORITIES FOR WHAT THEY WANTED THE GOVERNMENT TO BE FOCUSED ON AND I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MYTH AROUND IT SO IF WE LOOK AT HER IF WE LOOK AT DATA ACROSS EUROPE
AND WE ASK PEOPLE HOW MUCH THEY THINK THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORKING FOR THEM THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF BRITISH PEOPLE ACCORDING TO YOU WERE BAROMETER FEEL THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORKING FOR THEM THAT COMPARES TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF GERMANS AND THIRTY PER CENT OF FRENCH YET IT'S THE BRITISH THAT ARE HAVING THE REFERENDUM HOW MUCH DID THE VOTERS YOU SPOKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE CAMPAIGNS ON EITHER SIDE
THAT SURPRISED EVEN ME I DIDN'T THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF CUT THROUGH CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF ENCOURAGING US TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN YOUR UP ANYONE KNOW THE NAME OF THAT CAMP
DON'T WORRY I'M NOT SURPRISED SO BRITAIN STRONGER AND
ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT GETTING A LOT OF CAMPAIGN PUT THROUGH WELL ME ALL RIGHT CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE US TO LEAVE
TO GREAT STRONG WITH ME
PROTECTS OR SOMETHING THERE SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES OF THE CAMPAIGNS WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUES AND PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE IMMIGRATION WHICH IS A RELEVANT ISSUE IN TERMS OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IS AN ISSUE THAT MATTERS TO VOTERS IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES YOU HAVE THE SAME RECURRING THEMES SO IMMIGRATION AND BORDER CONTROL IS AN ISSUE THAT WHAT WILL COME OUT AND WHEN I SAID EARLIER THAT THE BRITISH WEREN'T
FOCUSED ON THE GOVERNMENTS NEED TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE THEY ARE HOWEVER THERE IS A GROUP ABOUT ER TWENTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION WHO DO CONSIDER IMMIGRATION TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE A GROUP OF ABOUT THE SIMILAR SIZE WHO CONSIDER IT TO BE THE LEAST IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ACTUALLY ISSUES AROUND IMMIGRATION AND BORDER CONTROL CAN BECOME QUITE EXPLOSIVE WHEN I KNOW IF WE STAY
IT'S ALWAYS A BIT OF A TOUCHY SUBJECT BUT WE HAVE TO LET ME WALK FOREIGNERS COME INTO THE COUNTRY AND WORK AND HUNG THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I THINK WE ARE
ALREADY STRUGGLING AS IT IS BRITAIN NEED TO HAVE
WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY THEIR OARS BUT O.K.
DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THEN THE CRIME I MEAN YOU WATCH THE T.V. AND IT'S MORE AND MORE
WAS THAT ALWAYS IN THE CRIME BUT ON THE UP DO YOU OTHER HAND I'VE GOT A CRITICALLY ILL WOULD CHARLES WOOD AND IN HOSPITAL WAS THEIRS
AMAZING YOU KNOW YOU JUST SEEM TO HEAR ABOUT THE BAD STUFF ON THE T.V. NO NOT THE ROVER HERE AND THERE
I WAS DOING GREAT JOBS AND THINGS YOU KNOW YOU
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT THERE'S ANOTHER AREA THAT PEOPLE DESCRIBE AS SORT OF BRITISH NURSE I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD THINK OF IT IS JUDICIAL CONTROL BUT WHO GETS TO MAKE LAWS AND THEN REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT AREA IS THE ECONOMY AND OF COURSE THAT CENTRAL HOW MUCH DOCTOR HARRISON DID PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE OF THIS BEING NOT JUST A BIG MOMENT BUT POTENTIALLY A ONCE IN A GENERATION MOMENT
THAT WAS A SURPRISE FOR ME WE ACTUALLY HAD A DISCUSSION ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HOP BACK IN IN A VERY QUITE EASILY IF IF IT WASN'T WORKING FOR THEM SO I THINK THE IDEA OF THIS BEING A ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOMENT WHICH IS A VERY SALIENT ISSUE IT WASN'T COMING THROUGH IN TERMS OF THIS BEING SUCH A DECISIVE ISSUE IF WE LIKE
WHEN CAN WE THEN DECIDE TO HANG ON THIS ISN'T WORKING WE CAN WE WANT TO REJOIN THAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I THINK WHAT DO WE THINK PRISON EVERY FIVE YEARS OR THREE YEARS
IF YOU CAN'T DO IT THEN YOU SAY LOOK I'M REALLY SORRY CAN WE JOIN AGAIN WE'VE MADE A MISTAKE
THERE'S A LIMIT OBVIOUSLY TO HOW FAR ANY SET OF OPINION POLLS OR ALL RESEARCH CAN CAN GUIDE PEOPLE'S CONCLUSIONS ON ON ALL OF THIS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE SIMPLE QUESTION OF WHO TURNS OUT TO VOTE GOING TO BE ITS CRITICAL IT'S KEY TO WHETHER OR NOT WE REMAIN IN YOUR APPLE LEAVE SO THE OPINION POLLS TELL US THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT LEAD AMONGST THE BRITISH POPULATION IN WISHING TO REMAIN IN EUROPE BUT WHEN YOU OVER LES
ACROSS AGE ANOTHER DEMOGRAPHICS THAT GIVE US AN INDICATION OF WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO TURN OUT TO VOTE ON THE DAY THE LEAD IS EVAPORATED SO THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION IN THE OVER FORTY FIVES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN THE UNDER FORTY FIVES TO WISH TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WE ALSO KNOW BASED ON PREVIOUS ELECTIONS IS THAT THE OVER FORTY FIVES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GO AND VOTE
SO THE CRITICAL ISSUE BECOMES WHEN YOU'RE PREDICTING THE OUTCOME IS YOU'RE PREDICTING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UNDER FORTY FIRES WILL VOTE ACCORDING TO THEIR NORMAL PATTERNS OR WHETHER THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT SO ULTIMATELY IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CAMPAIGNS IF YOU'RE PREDICTING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN SIX WEEKS' TIME REALLY YOU'RE PREDICTING THE SALIENT SEEMED THE CAMPAIGNS AND THEIR ABILITY TO GET THEIR VOTE OUT
SO IF VOTER TURNOUT MIRRORED WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN PREVIOUS GENERAL ELECTIONS THAT WOULD FAVOUR IT WE LOOKED AT THAT POINT THE ADVANTAGE IN THE POLLS TO REMAIN IS ERODED DOCTOR MICHELLE HARRISON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

FINALLY THE TIMES HAS A PICTURE OF A WEATHER PRESENTER ON AN AMERICAN T.V. STATION BEING HANDED A CARDIGAN MIDWAY THROUGH HER FORECAST LIBERTY BELL ASKED WHAT'S GOING ON AND WAS TOLD THE STATION WAS GETTING A LOT OF EMAILS COMPLAINING THAT THE DRESS SHE WAS WEARING WASN'T APPROPRIATE FOR A MORNING SHOW AFTER PUTTING THE CARDIGAN ON SHE COMMENTED I LOOK LIKE A LIBRARIAN NOW FEMINISTS ARE SAID TO BE OUTRAGED
I'M OUT AND POSSIBLY LIBRARIANS TO WHITE'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE'LL BE A FEW SORE HEADS IN LEICESTER THIS MORNING AFTER THE CELEBRATIONS YESTERDAY MANY WHICH WENT ON WELL INTO THE NIGHT QUARTER OF A MILLION FANS LINED THE STREETS OF THE CITY CENTRE FOR THE VIC DEEP VICTORY A PARADE OF THE TEAM THAT HAD DEFIED ALL THE ODDS TO WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TITLE
LADIES GENTLEMEN THE BARCLAYS PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN NEW
BECAUSE IN ALL THE S'S ON THEY PUSH BEHIND BARS AND THEY BELIEVE IT EVERY TIME WE WAS DOWN THERE THEN
THAT WAS THE LEICESTER MANAGER OF COURSE CLAUDIO RANIERI WELL ONE OF THOSE FANS WHO ADMITTED HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT COULD HAPPEN WAS A CERTAIN GARY LINEKER YOU'LL HAVE HEARD OF HIM AND HE PLAYED FOR LEICESTER HIMSELF BACK IN THE DAY I ASKED HIM HAS IT SUNK IN YET
I'M PERFECTLY WELL AWARE I KEEP REMINDING MYSELF EVERY MORNING BY LOOKING AT THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE I MEAN
THE STUNNING CONSIDERING WHERE THEY WERE JUST OVER A YEAR AGO BOON SEEMINGLY TO ALLEGATION I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD THIS KIND OF SURPRISED
CATHERINE IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE AND WHAT'S MORE IT HAPPENED TO MY QUEEN BUT LOOK LEAD AS YOU SAY AN EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT SIXTY THOUSAND TO ONE OFF SITE AS NO ONE WOULD HAVE IT WAS AN ALL
COULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN WE SEE IN THIS POTENTIALLY A CHANGE AT THE TOP OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL I DON'T THINK SO TO BE HONEST I THINK IT WILL BE A ONE OFF I DON'T THINK IT'S A TURN I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THE VERY BIG CLUBS THE GIANTS IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL THAT HAVE DOMINATED SO MANY YEARS HAVE HAD A KIND OF
LOLLY PROCEEDINGS THERE IN TRANSITIONAL PHASE BUT NOT HAVE SPENT THEIR VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY PARTICULARLY BRILLIANTLY AND ALL THOSE TEAMS AT THE SAME TIME JUST COULDN'T FIND ANY SORT OF CONSISTENCY I
SURPRISE THAT THIS WILL BE ANYTHING UNBELIEVABLE ONE BUT THE REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE APPLAUDED EVEN THOSE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY GRIPPED BY FOOTBALL WAS PRECISELY THE MONEY THING WASN'T IT IT WAS A TEAM THAT DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH AS CHELSEA OR YOU CAN WRITE IT OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE
THEY DID IT COULD WE BE BEGINNING MAYBE TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY WALKING OFF WITH ALL THE TROPHIES THAT'S THE POINT REALLY ISN'T IT WELL IN POET AND YOU'D LIKE TO THINK SO ROBERT'S OUT IT'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THOUGH THE REDS HAVE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN THE TRENCH
THE BIG CLUBS STILL HAVE TO HUGE AMOUNTS THE CLUBS JUST BEHIND THEM THE LEFT AS THE WEST HAM'S OF SOUTHAMPTON'S THAT I'VE DONE SHOWS BRILLIANTLY
YOU CAN CREATE GIVES CHANGED A CHANCE TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE WHILE UNDERSTANDABLY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO WHAT
NO WE'VE HAD ONE MIRACLE RESULT THERE NEXT ONE OBVIOUSLY IS WALES IN THE EUROS THRASHING IS CONCERNED AND THEN GOING ON TO THRASH EVERYBODY ELSE THE ODDS ON THAT PLEASE
I'M NOT GOING TO GET IT I THINK YOU ARE I'M NOT I'VE GOT HER MYSTERY BUT WHO KNOWS YOU KNOW WITH GARETH IN THERE AND WE MIGHT EVEN GET A BRITISH
CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF THINGS THAT TRANSPIRED THIS SEASON IN MIGHT JUST CARRY ON INTO THE SUMMER BUT BETTER GET IT PROBABLY WON'T BUT THEN YOU HAVE SAID THAT BEFORE A MEAL THE LAST TIME YOU SAID YOU'D PRESENT THE PROGRAMME IN YOUR UNDERPANTS AS I RECALL
ME AND MY BIG MOUTH I KNOW THERE'S A TWEETER ACTUALLY WAY BACK IT'LL BE DONE HURDLE WHEN I WOULD GET QUITE EXCITED BY LESTER'S PROGRESS BUT AT THAT STAGE I'M MUCH ON TROUT THE HEIGHT CATEGORICALLY KNEW THERE WAS ZERO THRUSTER
SORT OF LOW POINT BUT NOW I SEEM TO BE TWO BECAUSE THERE'S A RATHER EMBARRASSING THING BUT I HOPE SO I KNOW WHERE ARE WE GOING TO SEE THIS HAPPENING SOON HE WON'T WANT TO SEE IT OF COURSE YOU'RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE BE ACTUALLY WANTS TO SEE YOU AND YOU UP FOR THAT THAT'S IT WELL THAT'S THEIR CHOICE I SAID THE FIRST MATCH OF THE DAY NEXT SEASON
YOU COULD OF COURSE MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU ARE WEARING YOUR UNDERPANTS BUT YOU ALSO ARE WEARING TROUSERS ON TOP OF THAT AND THEN I'VE GOT MY GUIDE TO LOOKED AT MY WORDING ASHLEY SADLY I'VE GIVEN MYSELF VERY LITTLE BROOCH
SORRY I THOUGHT IT OVER THERE
OH I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GET THE AUTHOR PHOTOS FROM SOMETHING IF YOU ARE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP US GOING DURING THE SUMMER GARY THANK YOU THANKS A LOT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU
AND GARY LINEKER LOOKS BACK ON THE PREMIER LEAGUE SEASON AND CHARTS THE STORY OF LEICESTER'S SUCCESS IN A PROGRAMME BEING BROADCAST TONIGHT ON B. B. C. ONE AT TEN FORTY FIVE IT IS CALLED YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED LESTER'S IMPOSSIBLE DREAM YOU MAKE ANY PROMISES JOHN AND WHAT YOU GET YOUR WISH FOR WALES IN THE EUROS WHAT DO YOU THINK YES THE LINEKER EXPERIENCE HAS WARNED YOU OFF IF NOTHING ELSE
THE TIME IS THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS MONA SIDDIQUI PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC STUDIES AT NEW COLLEGE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YESTERDAY FRITZ WORLD ON THE MOVE DAY THE B.B.C. BROADCAST A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MIGRATION AND RETURN
IT MADE ME THINK OF MY OWN JOURNEY TO THE U.K. WHEN MY PARENTS CAME HERE THEY LIKE MANY OF THEIR GENERATION NEVER REALLY DISCUSSED THE PLANS WITH US AND FOR ME THE VAGUE SENSE OF A RETURN TO PAKISTAN LINGERED FOR SEVERAL YEARS
WHEN IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME THAT WE WEREN'T GOING BACK IN I REMEMBER FEELING A PROFOUND SENSE OF SADNESS THIS WASN'T BECAUSE I REMEMBERED MUCH ABOUT KARACHI BUT I WONDERED AS A CHILD HOW ANY OTHER COUNTRY COULD EVER BECOME HOME
FOR YEARS I WOULD LOOK UP AT AN AEROPLANE AND THINK THAT PLANE'S ALWAYS TOOK YOU AWAY FROM PLACES THAT THESE LONG JOURNEYS WERE NOT ABOUT FINDING NEW DESTINATIONS BUT ABOUT LEAVING BEHIND THOSE WE LOVE
BUT BRITAIN DID BECOME MY HOME SO DECADES LATER I WAS PUZZLED WHEN A MAJOR SCOTTISH GALLERY INVITED ME AND MY FAMILY TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED FOR AN EXHIBITION
THE EXHIBITION WAS CELEBRATING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE OF INTO PAKISTANI HERITAGE AND DESPITE FEELING VERY HONOURED I ALSO FELT UNEASY AT THE THOUGHT THAT I WAS IN SOME WAYS LINKED TO MIGRATION STORY I DIDN'T SEE MYSELF AS A MIGRANT BECAUSE THAT IMPLIED MOVEMENT I WAS BRITISH AND THE U.K. WAS MY ONLY REAL HOME
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU CANNOT THINK OF MIGRATION WITHOUT THINKING OF HOME HOME AND RETURN A POWERFUL WORDS WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR AN ACT OF DESPERATION MOVEMENT ALWAYS MEANS A RUPTURE OF SORTS
THIS IS WHY THE KIND OF HOSPITALITY WE GIVE TO OTHERS CAN NEVER SIMPLY BE ABOUT OFFERING FOOD AND SHELTER IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING A SENSE OF HOME AND NORMALITY EVEN IF IT'S TEMPORARY
AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE PHYSICAL NEEDS A PRIMARY BUT THEY'RE NEVER ENOUGH
WE WANT TO FEEL SECURE CARED FOR AND DESPITE ENTERING AS A STRANGER WE DON'T WANT TO REMAIN A STRANGER A SENSE OF HOME IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR SENSE OF WELLBEING
GIVING HOSPITALITY IS NOT WITHOUT RISK BUT DESCRIPTION OF COMMANDMENTS IN BOTH AROUND AND THE BIBLE TO GIVE HOSPITALITY TO THE VULNERABLE MAKES HOSPITALITY A DUTY NOT AN ACT OF CHARITY
TODAY WE FOCUS ON THE MIGRATION ISSUE IN TERMS OF A CRISIS OF BORDERS AND RESOURCES BUT IN ALL THE POLITICAL COMPLEXITY THE REAL STORY IS OUT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S HOPES AND FEARS
LEAVING YOUR COUNTRY CAN HAVE LONG TERM EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES EVEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BUILD A NEW LIFE ELSEWHERE
DESPITE THE GRATITUDE FELT BY SO MANY TO HAVE REACH SAFE SHORES OTHERS WILL CONTINUE TO FEEL DISPLACED UNTIL THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO RETURN ONE DAY TO REBUILD AND BREATHE NEW HOPE INTO WHAT WE SEE AS WAR RAVAGE LANDS AND YET FOR THEM HAS ALWAYS REMAINED HOME
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT IF TERRORISTS ATTACK LONDON OR ANY OTHER BIG CITY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER THE POLICE WILL SWING INTO ACTION AND ALSO WE WERE SHORT BUT WHAT IF THEY ATTACK TARGETS A NUCLEAR POWER STATION PERHAPS IN A RURAL AREA MANY MILES FROM A CITY THE POLICE FEDERATION'S WARNING THEM IN THAT CASE THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE BE SITTING DUCKS AND THEY'RE A QUESTION BEING RAISED APART FROM MAD ABOUT WHETHER ENOUGH POLICE OFFICERS ARE VOLUNTEERING TO BE TRAINED AS ARMED OFFICERS I'M JOINED
BY STEVE WHITE WHO CHAIRS THE POLICE FEDERATION AND DEPUTY TO CONSTABLE SIMON CHESTED AM HERE'S THE ARMED POLICING LEAVE FOR THE NATIONAL POLICE USE COUNCIL
STEVEN WHITE ON THEIR OTHER PEOPLE APART FROM THE POLICE WHO WOULD RESPOND IF FOR NUCLEAR POWER STIFF YOU EXCUSE ME A NUCLEAR POWER STATION WERE TO BE ATTACKED QUITE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM ANYWHERE
WELL OF COURSE THERE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF RESOURCES THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO RECOGNISE HERE IS THAT THE POLICE SERVICE THAT IS INDEPENDENT FROM STATE AND HIS IS GOVERNED BY THE LAW HAS PROMISED SEE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH TERRORISM AND IT SHOULD BE IN ITS RIGHT AND PROPERLY THAT'S THE POLICE SERVICE
THAT SHOULD LEAD SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE POLICE SERVICES PROPERLY RESOURCED AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO RECRUIT THE VOLUNTEERS THE VOLUNTEER POLICE OFFICERS TO FILL THOSE GAPS IN FLORENCE CAPABILITY SO THAT SHOULD SOMETHING AWFUL SUCH AS YOU DESCRIBE HAPPENED WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO DEAL WITH IT BUT THE FACT IS THERE ARE FEWER TWELVE HUNDRED FEWER OFFICERS TRAINED FIREARMS OFFICERS THAN THERE WERE TEN YEARS AGO A LITTLE LESS THAN TEN YEARS AGO SEVEN YEARS AGO
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S CONCERNING IT'S GOOD THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNISED THAT WE SUDDENLY NEED THIS UPLIFT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN PUT IN ACROSS THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS THAT IT'S DANGEROUS TO CUP POLICE NUMBER TO THE LEVEL THAT THE RAT IS FINALLY BEING LISTENED TO AND RECOGNISED AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP
BECAUSE DON'T FORGET THAT THE BRITISH POLICE SERVICES ARE CAN DO SERVICE WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT WE WANT THE HOME SECRETARY TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE RANK AND FILE ON THE VOICE OF THE POLICE FEDERATION HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A PROBLEM IF YOU DON'T SORT THIS OUT FINALLY THEY ARE LISTENING BUT IT STILL MEANS THAT WE'VE GOT A HUGE GAP TO FILL THE PUBLIC I HAVE TO RECRUIT
THREE THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS IN ORDER TO FILL THAT FIFTEEN HUNDRED IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME AND I WOULD JUST NOT QUITE SURE WHAT I CAN DO SERVICE MEANS WELL CANDY SERVICE MEANS THAT WE WILL RESPOND AS BEST WE CAN TO WHATEVER INCIDENT WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT WE THINK WE CAN DO BETTER BECAUSE WE NEED THE RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO SEARCH
CAPACITY THE SEARCH CAPABILITY IS IMPROVING A LOT OF WORK GOING ON AROUND THAT BUT IT'S SIMPLY HAS USED AS YOU DESCRIBE THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FIREARMS OFFICERS AND WHAT OUR OFFICERS ARE TELLING US OUT ON THE STREET IS THAT THEY'RE FEELING VULNERABLE THEY'RE FEELING THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE OUT OF THERE
PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN THE WAY THEY NEED THE RESOURCES SIMPLY AREN'T GOING TO BE BUT ISN'T THAT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO VOLUNTEER BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY DO VOLUNTEER THEY DO BECOME TRAIN AND THEN THEY SHOOT SOMEBODY THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND DEEPLY CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENT POLICE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION
IT NEEDS TO BE INDEPENDENT IT NEEDS TO HAVE WE NEED TO HAVE FAITH AND TRUST IN THE I.P.C.C. IS A SERVICE AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC AND AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT OFFICER SAYING WHY SHOULD I VOLUNTEER TO TAKE ON THIS ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY WHEN QUITE LIGHTLY IF I HAVE TO DISCHARGE MY FARM IT'S GOING TO BE ASSUMED THAT I'M A SUSPECT RATHER THAN EXPERT WITNESS AND I SHALL BE CALLING ON THE HOME SECRETARY TODAY TO SAY YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEW GUIDELINES OF THE I.P.C.C. ARE WANTING TO INTRODUCE
DO NOT COME INTO EFFECT BECAUSE THAT WILL SERIOUSLY HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO GET THOSE VOLUNTEERS TO COME FOR YOU I'M GOING TO USE YOU AS A FIREARMS OFFICER YOURSELF OR I WAS A FOREIGN OFFICER FOR SIX YEARS IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT ROLE AND INDEED I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE PROFESSIONALISM AND THE TRAINING THAT YOU RECEIVE AS A FIREARMS OFFICER IS SECOND TO NONE BUT IT IS AN ONEROUS AND ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNISED ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THAT SIMON CHESTERMAN FIRST OF DO YOU ACCEPT THE CONCERNS THAT THE POLICE FEDERATION RAISES
I DO BUT I THINK THERE'S JUST ONE THING I'D LIKE TO JUST PUT STRAIGHT WHICH IS THE NUCLEAR POWER STATION ISSUE VERY QUICKLY WITHOUT WISHING TO TAKE THE DEBATE OFF IN A DIFFERENT AREA NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS ARE EXTREMELY WELL PROTECTED BY A FULLY ARMED CIVIL NUCLEAR CONSTABULARY THE OTHER POINT THAT ERNEST LIKE MAKES IS THAT THE POLICE ARE AS IT WERE LEGAL PROTECTION THEY HAVE A STATUTORY RIGHT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT AND SO ON AND SO ON
DO YOU MEAN IN TERMS OF IF THEY END UP PULLING THE TRIGGER WELL IN EVERY SENSE YES WELL OF COURSE THEY ARE VOLUNTEERS STEVE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BEING AN ARMED OFFICER NOWADAYS HAS A VERY BIG ASK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PUTS OFFICERS OFF THIS ROLE ALL MAKES SOME THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT TAKING IT ON IS NOT NECESSARILY THE LEVEL OF THE THREAT THAT THEY MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO CONFRONT IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM IN THE EVENT THEY MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION TO USE LETHAL FORCE
THEY ARE HIGHLY TRAINED OBVIOUSLY DO WE WANT PEOPLE OTHER THAN THE POLICE AS A FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN POINT IS MAKING THE POLICE FEDERATION IS MAKING NO I DON'T THINK WE DO I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT WE SELECT FIREARMS OFFICERS THEY ARE GENERALLY EXPERIENCED POLICE OFFICERS WE HAVE PROVED THEIR JUDGEMENT IN TERMS OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT SO THEY'RE SELECTED FOR THE ROLE THEY ARE HIGHLY TRAINED
AND THEY ARE USED TO DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GUISES SO I THINK OBVIOUSLY IN THE RELATION TO A LARGE CAR TERRORIST ATTACK OF THE TYPE WE'VE SEEN ACROSS EUROPE WE WOULD LIKE MILITARY SUPPORT AND CLEARLY THEY WILL ADD SOME CAPABILITY TO WHAT WE'VE GOT BUT IN TERMS OF THAT FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE TO GUN CRIME AND HIGH LEVEL THREAT THE POLICE ALL THE BEST PEOPLE TO TACKLE THAT AND I THINK THE MILITARY
EXCEPT THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH POLICE THAT'S THE POINT TWELVE HUNDRED FEWER THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO YEAH THAT'S RIGHT CERTAINLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN THE NUMBER OF ARMED OFFICERS HAS DROPPED BY ABOUT THE NUMBER THAT YOU'VE JUST QUOTED AND OF COURSE NOW WE'RE WITH WITH TRYING TO RECRUIT MORE BUT THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THAT REALLY AND THE THE MAIN REASON OF COURSE IS THE FACT THAT THE POLICE HAVE FACED SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CUTS AND CHIEF CONSTABLES HAVE HAD TO MAKE SOME VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT RISK AND BALANCING RESOURCES THERE SECONDLY THERE ARE FAR MORE
SORT OF ARMED POLICE IN COLLABORATIONS OUT THERE WERE FORCES ARE SHARING SPECIALIST RESOURCES TO GREAT EFFECT BUT JUST A FEW SECONDS LEFT THEY ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE I.P.C.C. V. THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING POLICE SHOOTINGS AND HOW THAT MIGHT CHANGE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE FORCE YES AND OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE PUT INTO A POSITION WHERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION TO USE FORCE
WHAT THEY WANT IS POST EVENT FOR THAT TO BE REPEATABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL WITNESS THEY UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENT RUSTICATION BUT THEY DON'T WANNA BE TREATED LIKE CRIMINAL SUSPECTS SIMON CHESTERMAN STEVE WHY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT OR LOUISE LEAR IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST

AND HE WENT ON TO SAY THIS WHAT WORRIES ME IS THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN TURKEY AND THE FACT THAT
COMING INTO EUROPE WITHOUT VISAS ON A NINETY DAY PERMIT WON'T LEAVE THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN TURKEY IS
DISCONCERTING AND DIFFICULT FOR MANY TURKS
YOU HAVE A VERY AUTHORITARIAN REGIME GETTING MORE AUTHORITARIAN GERMANY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MASSIVELY WORRIED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL TAX AT THE COME INTO GERMANY I'M PREDICTING A LOT MORE
HIS VISA FREE ACCESS FOR TURKS AND THIS MAY AS IT WERE ADD MASSIVE NUMBERS TO MIGRATION INTO YOU
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY BARONESS MERYL HUSSEIN F.C. WHO IS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER SHE'S ON THE ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP ON TURKEY TURKISH CYPRIOT PARENTS CAME HERE FROM CYPRUS IN THE EARLY FIFTIES AT ALSO BY JOHN REDWOOD FORMER TORY CABINET MINISTER OF COURSE ON ONE OF THE LEADING CAMPAIGNERS FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU WILL KNOW DON'T HAVE BEEN APPLAUDING WHAT SIR RICHARD SAID LAST NIGHT
I FEAR THAT HE IS RIGHT THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS HARMING EUROPEAN SECURITY AND PROSPERITY AND THIS IS NOW FUELLING VERY UNPLEASANT EXTREME POLITICS HE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE WAY THAT THE E.U. IS NOT RESPONDING WELL TO A MASS MIGRATION CRISIS AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE CRISIS OF THE EURO AREA WITH MASS UNEMPLOYMENT OR YOU THEN PRODUCES EXTREME RIGHT GROUPINGS
AND YOU SEE THE E.U. ALTERNATING BETWEEN BEING GENEROUS AND THEN BEING EXTREMELY CLUMSY AND AUTHORITARIAN NOW TALKING ABOUT PUTTING UP BORDER TOWERS AND WALLS AND FENCES ALONG THE TURKISH BORDER WITH THE MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE THEY'RE SO NERVOUS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES ON THE EUROPEAN WHAT WOULD YOU DO
TO SOLVE HELP SOLVE MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS SOLVING THEIR MIGRATION CRISIS IF NOT WHAT HAS BEEN AGREED WITH TURKEY I WOULD GET THE UNITED KINGDOM OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH THE MOST WEEKS AND HAS THE INDEPENDENT WELL YES IT DOES HELP A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE FOR US
WELL LET ME EXPLAIN AS SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE SAYS WE WILL BE STRONGER ON SECURITY INTELLIGENCE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR VERY GOOD REASONS HE PUTS IN DETAILED ARGUMENT THE OTHER SOME ASIAN CRISIS PEOPLE WILL STILL LEAVE COUNTRIES TRYING TO GET TO OTHER COUNTRY THAT WE NEED GOOD INTELLIGENCE TO DEAL WITH THE MINORITY WHO ARE TERRORISTS WAS HIS MAIN CASES THAT THERE WILL BE SOME TERRORISTS AND THAT THE MORE PEOPLE ON THE MOVE THEM OR TERRORISM YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET
AND TO DEAL WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS WE NEED TO CARRY ON DOING AND INTENSIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE AREAS WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS IS FOR US AND LIKE MINDED COUNTRIES OF GOOD WILL TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT BACK UP TO CREATING PEACE AND CREATING PROSPERITY IN THE COUNTRIES THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING LADY ISN'T
THEY'RE A PROBLEM AS SIR RICHARD SAYS ALL PEOPLE TURKS BEING ABLE TO COME FREELY INTO CHANGING COUNTRIES AND THEREFORE BE A STONE'S THROW FROM MY OWN COUNTRY FROM OUR OWN BORDERS WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR THESE AT ALL THIS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION HAVE THEM AFTER ALL
YES AND ONLY SEVEN MILLION TURKS HAVE GOT PASSPORTS OF COURSE SO THE NOTION THAT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TURKS RULE GOING TO ARRIVE ON THE SHORES OF EUROPE BY TUESDAY IS RATHER IS RATHER EXAGGERATED IF I MAY SAY SO YOU TEN PER CENT OF SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF THE IDEA WELL THE VISA IS FOR TRAVEL FOR DOING BUSINESS AND FOR LEISURE IT'S NOT FOR ME IT DOESN'T GIVE ANYONE THE RIGHT TO LIVE OR TO WORK IN THAN THE MANAGER WOULD COME HERE WHEN THEY COME THEY WERE TO DO COME THEY HAVE TO HAVE A VISA
THERE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A VISA THEY'RE ALREADY THREE MILLION TAX TOUCH NATIONALS AT TURKISH I THINK TEST LIVING IN TURKEY AND MANY OF THEIR FAMILIES ALREADY VISIT THEM WE HAVE A AROUND HALF A MILLION HERE IN THE U.K. SO THE IDEA I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT TURKEY IS SOMEHOW A THREAT TURKEY'S BEEN CONTAINING THE SYRIAN REFUGEE THREE MILLION OF THEM IN TURKEY SO IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN HELPING
THE EUROPEAN UNION BY THE ACTING'S A DE FACTO BORDER PROTECTING EUROPE IF YOU LIKE FROM THE FIGURES HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THE FIGURES BUT DROP DRAMATICALLY INCREASE CERTAINLY TO THE HUNDREDS FROM THE THOUSANDS SO ALREADY THERE'S BEEN A WE'VE SEEN A DIFFERENCE A TURKEY HAS MADE AT THE COST OF ITS OWN SECURITY IF I MAY SAY THEY'VE HAD THEIR OWN PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD THEY'VE HAD TO SUICIDE BOMBS AND EXPLOSIONS ONE HUNDRED AND THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR IN A SUICIDE BOMB BY
BY AN ICE IS SOMEONE WHO IS LINKED TO ASSES SO YOU KNOW THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE TURKISH NATIONALS WHO ARE TERRORISTS READY TO COME TO EUROPE AND TO PUT OUR SECURITY AT RISK ON THE OTHER HAND IF THERE WERE SUCH PEOPLE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO THE SHANG IN COUNTRIES WITHOUT A VISA THEY WOULD BE A POTENTIAL THREAT
WELL THEY COULD BE BUT DO YOU KNOW B. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED ALREADY IN BELGIUM PARIS AND ANOTHER PLACE WHERE HIS THING TERRORIST THREATS THEY HAVE BEEN HOME GROWN THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THEY WERE TURKISH NOT NATIONALS AT ALL SO I THINK THIS THIS DISCUSSION REALLY IS PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S FEARS IF I MAY SAY SO IT'S THE BRECK THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW TURNING TO THE POLITICS OF FEAR
YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF A BIG STICKING TO THE OR EVEN BRINGING FORWARD THE ARGUMENTS OF THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THE OTHER ARGUMENTS THAT DEBATE HAS MOVED OVER NOW TO KEEPING THE TASTE FOR TURKS FOR COMING AND THIS IS PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S FEARS
AT THE PARTICLES FROM ROBERT YOU'RE ON THAT POINT SHE SHE HAS A POINT THEIR LAUNDRY PROJECTS HERE BRECK'S IT STYLE NO I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE AT ALL I THINK WHERE THE SIDE THAT ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY WE CAN HELP IMPROVE THE SITUATION IN THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TO LEAVE AND TO LET THEM GET ON WITH TRYING TO PERFECT THEIR EURO ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF MASS MIGRATION
HIS POVERTY BUT THEN WHEN PEOPLE ARRIVE IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THEY DISCOVER THERE ARE NO JOBS OR MASS UNEMPLOYMENT SO THEN THEY ALL WANT TO GO ON TO THE NORTHERN COUNTRIES AND IT'S TERRIBLY TERRIBLY IMPORTANT THAT THE EURO COUNTRIES HAVE THE SPACE TO FIX THEIR EURO PROBLEM AND WHAT TURKEY AT HAS OFFERED HIS PART SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM BY REPATRIATING THOSE WHO HAVE LANDED IN GREECE FOR INSTANCE ILLEGALLY
BUT AS SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE MAKES CLEAR IN HIS RATHER INTERESTING REMARKS BUT IT ALSO CREATES ALL SORTS OF OTHER TENSIONS AND DIFFICULTIES WHICH WILL FUEL THIS EXTREME POLITICS IF WE CARRY ON WITH THESE DREADFUL EUROPEAN UNION POLICIES THAT MEAN VERY LARGE PARTS OF THE EUROZONE ARE LIVING IN POVERTY UNEMPLOYMENT VERY LOW INCOMES NO GREAT HOPE AND MOST EXTREME CASE BEING GREECE AND YOU COMBINE THAT WITH VERY LARGE MIGRANT FLOWS FROM PLACES WHICH ARE EVEN POORER
WE SEE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION FAR FROM HELPING OUR SECURITY AND PROSPERITY IS ACTUALLY UNDERMINING SHAUNA'S ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WITH TURKEY AND A GOOD EUROPEAN I WANT TO SEE THEM PUT IN PLACE POLICIES THAT WORK AND THEY THEY HAVE TO BE POLICIES THAT ALLOW THE MEMBER STATES TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHO THEY LET INTO THE ALL THEY WOULD YOU MAKE IN THEIR OWN DECISION WE ARE NOT IN THE SHINGEN GROUP WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ALLOW ANY OF THESE VISA FREE TURKS INTO A COUNTRY THAT ONCE SOMEBODY HAS ACQUIRED RIGHTS SPY
LEGALLY COMING TO ANOTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND UNDER FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT RULES OF COURSE THEY CAN GO ANYWHERE IN THE ZONE AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING HOW DID THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT SHOWING A BIOMETRIC PASSPORT AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT YES BUT THEY WILL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THOSE ONCE THEY HAVE SETTLED IN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SO YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THESE ALL THE TIME HERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT YOU DO NOT CONTROL YOUR OWN BORDERS AND THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE
AN INTEREST IN THE COLLECTIVE SECURITY OF THE BORDERS AND WE NOW SEE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION BY EXTENDING EFFECTIVELY ITS BORDERS TO THE TURKISH SYRIAN BORDER AND THE TURKISH OR I'LL HAVE TO DIS IS IN GREAT DIFFICULTY I HAVE TO DISAGREE THIS THAT JOHN REDWOOD HE'S SAYING THERE WE RICHARD DEAR LOVES SPEECH WAS VERY INTERESTING HE'S OFFERED NO SOLUTIONS ON THE MIGRANT CRISIS AT ALL ALL HE'S SAYING IS THAT
GIVING THE TURKS PLEASE A FREE TRAVEL IN MACHINERY FROM NOT THE UNITED KINGDOM TO TO VISIT TO DO BUSINESS IS THE THREAT SOMEHOW TO THIS COUNTRY WHAT IS NOT OFFERING AT ALL IS ANY SOLUTION TO THE SYRIAN CRISIS IN FACT HE SAID THE OPPOSITE WE CANNOT CLOSE AT ALL ON THE MIGRANT CRISIS BUT THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY HOW IN THINGS REUSING APPALLING LANGUAGE TO SOMEHOW ALLOWING TURKS AND THEY WILL BE THE PROSPEROUS TURKS THE ONES WANT TO DO BUSINESS WE WANT TO TRAVEL I WANT TO GO ON HOLIDAY NOT THEIR FAIR
TO TRAVEL ACROSS SOMEHOW THEY ARE THE PROBLEM THIS IS THE POLITICS OF FEAR NO I'VE BEEN VERY POSITIVE IF I SAID THAT I'M NOT YOU I'M TALKING ABOUT ME YOU WON'T TELL ME IF I'M ANY HENDRY LANGUAGE AT ALL I WOULDN'T LET HER FINISH HER THEN SHE'LL REALLY LAUGH AS HIS VERY IN FUNDRAISING USE THE WORD GASOLINE WHICH IS YOU CAN GET MORE IN SUNDRY THAN THAT AND YOU ARE SAYING HOW IMPRESSED YOU ARE AND HOW YOU KNOW WHAT A VERY INTERESTING AND VERY POSITIVE SPEECH IT IS IT DOESN'T OFFER ANY SOLUTIONS TO THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF SYRIANS WHO ARE
ABSOLUTELY NOW DROWNING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN PEOPLE NOW THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY IS HOLLOWED OUT IT'S NOT OFFERING ANY SOLUTION TO THAT WHATSOEVER AND COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
IN IRAQ YOU SOME YEARS AGO I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE IT WITH A YOU KNOW A BIG BIG PINCH OF SALT JOHN REDWOOD FINAL THOUGHT I THINK WE WE COULD SOLVE THE CRISES BY FIRST OF ALL GETTING PROPER CONTROL OF OUR OWN BORDERS AND I THINK OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE BE WELL ADVISED TO DO THE SAME AND SECONDLY MY DOING FAR MORE TO SOLVE THE UNDERLYING
TENSIONS AND CONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM COS THEY NEED HOPE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS ON PEACE AND PROSPERITY THERE BECAUSE EUROPE SIMPLY CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN BAD COUNTRIES JOHN EDWARD BARRETT EDGES THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW TWENTY PAST EIGHT IF YOU SEARCH FOR A SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE RECIPE ON THE B.B.C. WEBSITE YOU GET FOURTEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHICH RATHER BACKS UP THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY RECIPES ON THERE AT THE MOMENT ELEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE TO BE PRECISE OF WHICH ELEVEN THOUSAND OR ABOUT TO BE REMOVED AFTER CRITICISM THAT THE B. B. C. PRODUCES TOO MUCH MAGAZINE STYLE CONTENT RECIPES FROM B.B.C. SHOWS WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE
JUST FOR A THIRTY DAY PERIOD AFTER TRANSMISSION BUT WE'RE JOINED BY THE CHEF DOWN LEOPARD WHOSE RECIPES APPEAR ON THE B.B.C. WEBSITE AT THE MOMENT AND FROM BRISTOL BY HIS CLAY FOOD WRITER WITH THE DAILY TELEGRAPH GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING TO SHOW A DAMN LEOPARD RATHER BAD NEWS FOR YOU THEN
OH WELL I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S BAD NEWS FOR FOR ME AS A CONSUMER AS AS A PERSON THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO ON TO THE B.B.C. WEBSITE IN AND FIND THIS EXTRAORDINARY ARCHIVE IT'S BRITISH LIBRARY ON ONLINE FOOD AND RECIPES IT'S WORLD CLASS AND IT NEEDS AN INDEPENDENT BODY THAT'S CLEAR OF COMMERCIAL INTEREST TO LOOK AFTER IT BUT FOURTEEN RECIPES FOR SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE
I PUT THE CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE INTO GOOGLE AND OFF THE TOP FIVE OPTIONS THREE OF THEM CAME FROM B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U.K. WILL BE B. C. GOOD FOOD THERE ARE LOTS OF CHOCOLATE CAKES AND WE WANT THE VARIETY IN THERE BUT WE ALSO WANT THE REASSURANCE THAT IT WORKS WITH THE B.B.C. RECIPES YOU KNOW THEY WORK I CAN TELL YOU LOADS OF THOSE RECIPES OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET DON'T WORK WILL FAIL THE P.B. SEE ONCE WORK SOMETHING WILL YOU MISS THEM
I WILL AND I THINK DAD'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S A FANTASTIC ARCHIVE OF LARGELY BRITISH RECIPES I THINK THAT WHAT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR FOR READERS IS IS THAT THE B.B.C. GOOD FOOD WEBSITE AND THE B.B.C. FOOD WEBSITE ARE TWO VERY VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND RUM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RECIPES WHICH HAD BEEN TRIPLE TESTED HER COMPLETELY TRUSTWORTHY THEY SHOULD THE B.B.C. GOOD FOOD RECIPES WHICH HAD BEEN CLEANED IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE THEM
VERY SUITABLE FOR THE DOMESTIC KITCHEN THE B. B. SEAFOOD RECIPES CAME DIRECTLY FROM CHEFS AND HADN'T BEEN TESTED BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S GOT A VALUE AS WELL IN ITSELF IS IN THAT THEY'RE MORE PURELY WHAT THE CHEF WANTED TO PUT IN THEIR RECIPE RIGHT AND IT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH OF THOSE ARE THE COAL OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND IS GOING TO BE FROM BOTH OF THOSE NO IT'S NOT IT'S ONLY TO BE B. SEAFOOD WEBSITE THAT'S GONE THE B.B.C. GOOD FOOD WAS LARGELY OWNED BY MEDIATE MEDIA ALTHOUGH THAT WAS
ALSO PART OF THE B.B.C. OWNERSHIP BUT IT'S BEEN BROUGHT BACK INTO THE B.B.C. WORLDWIDE FOLD WHICH IS THE COMMERCIAL ARM OF THE B.B.C.
SO I WONDER IF THERE IS SOME REALISATION THAT THERE'S A CLASH HERE IN JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THINGS ARE PUT THE PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS TO US THIS MORNING WHETHER BY EMAIL OR ALL VIA TWITTER FOR EXAMPLE I HARDLY THINK MY LOCAL NEWSPAPER WEBSITE IS GOING TO REPLACE THESE RECIPES ONE PERSON SAYING I FOUND SOME WONDERFUL RECIPES BY THE B. B. C. WEBSITE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY FIRST PORT OF CALL IN SOMEONE ELSE SAYING
LICENCE FEE PAYERS ALREADY PAID FOR THE FOR THE COOKERY PROGRAMMES THERE PUT THOSE RECIPES IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THEREFORE THEY SHOULD REMAIN YES THIS MAKES ME GASP FUNNY WHERE ARE OUR RIGHTS AS LISTENERS TOOK WAS THESE ARCHIVES AT THE LIBRARIES THE ONLINE RESOURCES THAT YOU KNOW FORMER SIT EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES THESE DIGITAL ARCHIVES MIGHT SOUND NEWFANGLED THAN FLIPPANT LISTENERS BUT THEY ARE OUR LIBRARIES AND ONCE WE DELETE THEM THEY'RE GONE
I THINK IT'S ALSO NOT JUST THE RECIPES THERE ARE PAGES ON NUTRITION THEM BACK UP PAGES ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY THE TEAM AT B.B.C. FOOD NOT THE B.B.C. GOOD FOOD TEAM WHICH IS DIFFERENT AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THOSE ARE GOING TO BE LOST AS WELL AND ALL THOSE JOBS THEY SPECIALISTS IN FOOD TO USED TO MAN THE DEPARTMENT IN THE B.B.C. WILL ALSO BE A PUPPY THERE ARE SOME OF THESE ELEVEN THOUSAND THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT COULDN'T WE AND THIRDLY SOME OF THOSE FOURTEEN RECIPES FOR SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE
WELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT ANY LIBRARY PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE BOOKS YOU COULD YOU COULD LOSE BUT I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE NOT AND ACTUALLY FOURTEEN RECIPES FOR SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE GOOD MISSES HER RECIPE FOR SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE AREA OF ITALY WHERE THE RECIPE FIRST CAME FROM SO
I THINK FOURTEEN'S NOT THAT MANY FIVE HUNDRED PIE RECIPE AND I KNOW YOU'RE A BIG PIE MAKER BUT EVEN FOR YOU FIVE HUNDRED YES YES IN THE BRITISH LIBRARY THERE'S A BOOK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED RECIPES FOR PUDDINGS THAT CAME OUT IT WAS PRINTED IN NINETEEN THIRTIES I LOVED THAT THAT BOOK IS THERE TO SHOW THE DIVERSITY YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE LIKE COMPLAINING ABOUT CRIME NOVELS AND SAY HOW MANY CRIME NOVELS TO WE NEED TO WHAT SURELY WE ONLY NEED ONE HELP WEAN WE NEED
ALL OF THE STORIES THESE RECIPES ARE IN A WAY STORIES ABOUT THE WAY WE COOK THEM WE NEED THEM RECORDED BIT OF IT IS IT'S PART OF OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHEN WE BUY BY GETTING RID OF OF THOUSANDS OF THEM WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE PLAN HERE I'VE BEEN THAT YOU POSSIBLY MORE OF YOUR RECIPES BY THE TELEGRAPH WOULD COME TO BETWEEN US
I CERTAINLY DON'T I WOULDN'T BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT AT ALL I THINK BUT WHAT I DO YOU THINK IS GOOD ABOUT THIS IS IT'S CLEARING UP THE CONFUSION BETWEEN B.B.C. FOOD AND B.B.C. GOOD FOOD WHICH AND I THINK A LOT OF THE ANXIETY THAT'S COMING FROM PEOPLE IS THEY THINK THAT ALL OF B.B.C. RECIPES WILL BE GONE AND OF COURSE B.B.C. GOOD FOOD WILL VERY MUCH STILL BE THERE

OUR FRIENDSHIP I WAS VERY LIKE CATEGORIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE THIS FOR MONEY AND YOU RUIN MY LIFE FOR THE STUPIDITY AND SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND A NICE GUY AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND ME VERY GRACIOUS TO WORD SORT OF EVEN A PIECE OF BREAD THAT YOU THREW AT ME AND IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE THAT I WAS SLEEPING ON THE GROUND I WASN'T GIVEN CLOTHES WHEN IT WAS CALLED THEY TREATED ME LIKE AN ENEMY
ALTHOUGH I TRIED TO TELL THEM I'M NOT YOUR ENEMY I DON'T KNOW YOU I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME
AND NOR RELIGION FORGET ISLAM NOR RELIGION ALLOWS THIS DURING THE TIME YOU WERE HELD WAS ANYONE EVER KIND TO YOU YOU'RE NOT DYING MAKES THINGS EASIER

THAT'S IT HOW ARE YOU NOW I'M VERY WELL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE IT'S THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE FEELING TO JUST WAKE UP AND GO IN TO HAVE BREAKFAST WITH MY MOTHER TO JUST SEE HOW FIERCE SHALL BUZZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
HE SOUNDED VERY WELL DIDN'T HE REMARKABLE YOUNG MAN TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN BORIS JOHNSON WAS THE MAYOR OF LONDON HE ORDERED A REPORT INTO THE EFFECT OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE CITY AND WHETHER IT MET A EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS THE REPORT TOOK A FEW MONTHS TO COMPLETE IT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED NOW THE NEW MAYOR SAID HE CAN'T HAS PUBLISHED IT
AND IT HAS SOME DISTURBING CONCLUSION AS I'M JOINED BY KATIE KING FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT PETER WHO CO AUTHORED THE REPORT GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND WHAT IT SAYS IN A NUTSHELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT A QUARTER OF THE CITY'S SCHOOLS ARE IN AREAS THAT EXCEED EUROPEAN UNION LIMITS FOR NITROGEN DIOXIDE POLLUTION
THAT'S TRUE IN THAT WAS THE POSITION IN TWENTY TEN AND IT WAS THAT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED NO THE PUB REPORT WASN'T PUBLISHED IN FULL DO YOU KNOW WHY
I.E. A SCENE THAT THEY CHOSE NOT TO PUBLISH IT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WERE EXPECTED TO BE PUBLISHED TO YOU NOT ALL OF UP REPORTS TO GET PUBLISHED THEY CHOSE TO USE SOME DATA OUT OF THE REPORT LOOKING AT REDUCTIONS AND EXPOSURE THAT WERE PREDICTED FOR FUTURE YEARS
TELL US WHAT THIS MEANS EXCEEDING E.U. LIMITS FOR NITROGEN DIOXIDE AS FAR AS THE CHILDREN IN THOSE SCHOOLS ARE CONCERNED WHETHER YOU LIMIT VALUES ARE SET TO
YEAH SAFE LIMIT AND AIR POLLUTION IS SHOULD BE BELOW THOSE LIMIT VALUES ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS
AND IT MEANS THAT IN TWENTY TEN THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE SCHOOLS THAT WERE IN AREAS WHERE THE AIR POLLUTION EXCEEDED THOSE LIMIT VALUES AND OF COURSE LOTS OF PEOPLE LIVING THERE AND QUITE A PARTY AT THE SCHOOLS AND WHAT DOES NITROGEN DIOXIDE DUE TO YOU BUT TOXIC GAS THAT CAUSES RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS
AND HOW SERIOUS IS IT IN THE SCALE OF POLLUTION WERE AT I THINK QUITE A FEW PEOPLE ARE CAN CONFUSE MAYBE ABOUT WHAT CAUSES YOU THE MOST HARM WHERE DOES IT COME ON THAT SORT OF LIST OF HARMFUL POLLUTANTS
THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION BUT IT'S BEEN PROVED TO BE A POLLUTANT THE CAUSES LIFE REDUCTIONS IN LIFE
AND IT IS THE CASE ISN'T DID THAT WE BREAK THOSE E.U. LIMITS TO WHICH YOU REFERRED WE BREAK THE LAW IN EFFECT ALL THE TIME IN THIS COUNTRY YEAH LONDON'S AIR POLLUTION HASN'T QUITE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S GETTING THE LADY HE VALUES NOW IS IT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT IS MAKING ART DIRECTION THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN SOME TIME AGO AS YOU SAID AND
DATA THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE MORE RECENTLY DOES SHOW THAT THERE ARE FEWER EXCEED YOUR LIMIT VALUES BUT THERE ARE STILL AREAS IN SEQUENCE I BEST IN INNER LONDON AND JUST BORIS JOHNSON'S SPOKESMAN
EXCUSE ME HAS GIVEN US A STATEMENT HE POINTS OUT THAT THERE ARE NEW CLEANER GREENER BUSES TO REDUCE I KNOW EX EMISSIONS AND SO ON THOSE THAT SORT OF THING AS IS WHAT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE
THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEY'RE STILL QUITE BAD AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE GENERAL TRAFFIC AND CARS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PROBLEM ESPECIALLY DIESEL CARS
IT PRODUCES MORE KNOCKS THAN PETROL CARS YEP KATIE KING THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWENTY MINUTES TO NINE IT IS EXACTLY FIFTY YEARS SINCE A CONCERT IN MANCHESTER THAT CAME TO BE REGARDED AS A TWENTIETH CENTURY CULTURAL MILESTONE A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD BOB DYLAN WAS TOURING THE U.K. WITH FOR THE FIRST TIME AN ELECTRIC BACKING GROUP THE HAWKS SOME IN THE AUDIENCE AT MANCHESTER FREE HALL FELT BETRAYED BY HIS CONVERSION TO ELECTRICITY THE NIGHT IS ALSO REMEMBERED FOR THE MOST FAMOUS HECKLE IN ROCK'N'ROLL HISTORY HERE'S ANDY KERSHAW TO TAKE US BACK IN TIME

BUILT ON THE SITE OF THE PETERLOO MASSACRE IN EIGHTEEN NINETY IT WAS UNTIL ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO

REFERENDUM ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THE DEADLINE IS JUNE THE SEVENTH WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ALEX AND DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AT THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MANY ELIGIBLE VOTERS ARE STILL UNREGISTERED DO YOU THINK OUR LATEST ESTIMATE IS SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF
THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE YOUNG IF YOU'VE MOVED HOUSE RECENTLY PEOPLE FROM CERTAIN BACK BLACK AND MINORITY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THEN YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO REGISTERED TO VOTE IF YOU MOVED HOUSE IN THE LAST YEAR THE CHANCES ARE YOU AREN'T REGISTERED TO VOTE
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S VERY EASY TO DO THE CHANGES MADE TO THE FOLK VEGETATION SYSTEM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO YOU CAN NOW DO ONLINE AND ONLY A FEW MINUTES BUT THE DEADLINE AS HOOP SAYING HIS SEVENTH JUNE IS VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE WIDOW BEFORE THEN THE POINT ABOUT WHO IS UNREGISTERED TO VOTE IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU
TAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ALL YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE TO REMAIN SO POTENTIALLY THOSE WHO REGISTER BETWEEN NOW AND THE DEADLINE COULD HAVE A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE RESULT SO THROUGH US HE LOOKED AT REGISTRATION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE IS A VERY CONSISTENT PATTERN THAT IT IS IT'S ALWAYS YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO MOVED HOUSE RECENTLY SO WE HAVE ON BIG CAMPAIGNS AHEAD OF THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM
THE GENERAL ELECTION THE ELECTIONS ACTUALLY JUST GARDENER MAY AND WE ARE SEEING LOTS OF PEOPLE IT ACTUALLY PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING ON TO THE GULF AT U.K. FORWARD SLASH REGISTER VOTE WEBSITE
I'M GETTING REGISTERED JUST YESTERDAY THERE ARE NEARLY SEVENTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS TO HAD TO AN UNSUSPECTING VERY BIG SURGE IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS SO THERE IS STILL TIME WHAT IF PEOPLE JUST AREN'T SURE WHETHER THEY'RE REGISTERED FOR WHATEVER REASON LOTS OF HOUSEMAIDS ET-CETERA VERY REGRETTABLE PERHAPS THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS IF YOU'RE ALREADY REGISTERED TO VOTE YOU'VE GOT A POSTCARD FOR THE MALE ACTION THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO RE REGISTER UNLESS YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED HE MOVED HOUSE OR WHATEVER
EVERYONE FOR THE REFERENDUM WILL BE GETTING THEIR POLE CARD PEACE PAPER COMES TO YOUR FRONT DOOR YOU GET THAT BY THE TWENTY FIFTH OF MAY SO IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT THEN YOU AREN'T REGISTERED NEWS TAKE ACTION AFTER THAT BUT OF COURSE EVEN BEFORE THE POSTCARDS ARE GOING OUT WE KNOW AROUND SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE AREN'T REGISTERED SO GET ON AND DO THAT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE AND BRITISH EXPATS WHO
MADE HOMES IT ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE AND I HAVE A PARTICULAR DESIRE TO VOTE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MAINTAINED A HOME IN THE U.K. TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN THIS REFERENDUM NO DOUBT SO THE FRANCHISE FOR THE REF AND IS VERY SIMILAR TO FOR A GENERAL ELECTION AND EVIL OF OVERSEAS BUT YOU'VE BEEN ON A U.K. ELECTORAL WEBSTER IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THEN YOU WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AND WE'VE BEEN ADVERTISING AND REACHING OUT TO A WHOLE RANGE OF EXPAT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE TO GET THEM REGISTERED ACTUALLY THEY'RE DOING INSIGNIFICANT
ALEX ROBERTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT TWELVE MINUTES NOW IF I ASKED YOU TO NAME WHAT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF DEATH AMONG TEENAGERS AROUND THE WORLD WHAT A FEW THINK POISONING WELL IT IS THERE'S A REPORT OUT TODAY THAT SAYS IT'S INCREASING SHARPLY HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT INCLUDES ALCOHOLIC POISONING JOINING ME IS DOCTOR PETER HENDLEY WHO CHAIRS THE FACULTY OF ADOLESCENT THAN CHILD'S AKADE TREE FOURTH ROYAL COLLEGE OF SUPPLIED WRISTS AND OF SOLUTE MARLOWE WHO IS THE EVICTION RESEARCHER
AT KING'S COLLEGE LONDON DOCTOR HENRY THAT DOES THIS REPORT CHIME WITH WHAT WITH YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE IT CENTRES WITH BOTH MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES ABOUT THEM IN THE PITS OF THE FACULTY AROUND THE COUNTRY WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN PRESENTATION SIEVE SELF POISONING OTHER FORMS TO SELF HARM OVER THE LAST YEARS SO YOU WOULD DESCRIBE ALCOHOLIC POISONING AS SELF HARM UP WOULD YOU
I THINK IT VARIES THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DRINKING TOO MUCH AND IT'S JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF BEING IT RECKLESS OF BEING YOUNG AND SILLY TO GET DRUGS LIKELY THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE DRINKING PARTY EXCESS IN A WAY WHICH IS HERSELF FOR MYSELF DELIBERATELY KNOWING THAT IT WILL DO THEM WELL WE TRY TO AVOID FROM TALKING ABOUT DELIBERATE SELF HARM BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE INTENTIONS OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DO THINGS TO HARM THEMSELVES YOU CAN BE REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU START TO TALK TO PEOPLE
AND WHAT WE THINK OF SELF HARM AS A SORT OF A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS IT SHOWING THAT YOUNG PURSES IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR LIVES IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT FORMS AND IT'S ONLY REALLY WHEN YOU START TO TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR INTENTIONS THEY WHAT THEIR MOTIVATION WERE WHEN THEY SELF A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IT DEPENDS BUT HOW MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
WHO KILLED THEMSELVES WHETHER IT'S FROM DRINKING OR TAKEN PARECE THEM OR WHATEVER ACTUALLY INTEND TO
THAT I THINK IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THERE THERE ARE A SUB GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HE DELIBERATELY TAKEN OVERDOSES AND DO THINGS TO PRESENT THEIR PREVENT THEM FROM BEING DISCOVERED THERE ARE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN WHO ACT MORE IMPULSIVELY THEY MAY BE DISINHIBITED BY ALCOHOL BY DRUGS AND THEIR INTENTION IS MORE DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER IN FACT IT'S THE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE MOST AT RISK REALLY SO IF YOU LOOK AT COMPLETED SUICIDE YOUNG MEN A MUCH GREATER RISK THAT THE YOUNG WOMEN AND IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTING
IMPULSIVE WHEN THEY'RE IN DISINHIBITED SORRY MOTHER WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS I THINK THERE'S A LOT IN WHAT PETER SAYS WHAT WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SOME DRUGS THEY AFFECT THE BRAIN SO IN TERMS OF THIS IDEA OF WHAT'S INTENTIONAL AND WHAT ISN'T YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY MAY START OUT TRYING TO MEET PERHAPS RELIEVE DISTRESS BY DRINKING BUT THEN THE BRAIN CHANGES THAT HAPPEN WHILE THEY'RE DRINKING TURN THE PERSON INTO SOMEONE QUITE MAUDLIN AND RHEUMATISM
AND THEN THAT CAN TURN INTO SOMETHING REALLY DARK VERY DARK INDEED AND ALCOHOL IS IMPLICATED IN MODEST SUICIDE ATTEMPT CERTAIN DRUGS MAY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT SO I THINK WHAT PETER SAYS HE'S HE'S VERY RIGHT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS TYPE OF POISONING AND OTHER TYPES OF SELF HARM BEING A MANIFESTATION OF ADOLESCENT DISTRESS AND IN DIFFERENT TIMES WE SEEM TO HAVE HAD DIFFERENT TYPES OF MANIFESTATIONS OF DISTRESS SO THE VICTORIANS USED TO THINK THEY WERE MADE OF GLASS AND THAT THEY WOULD BREAK AND THAT WAS HOW THEY SO THEY WOULD LIE VERY VERY STILL AND YOU CAN IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YOU CAN THINK MORE YEAH I CAN KIND OF SEE THAT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT BY SELF HARMING IT'S DOING LOTS OF THINGS IT IT'S IT'S ACTING OUT
MAYBE SOME SELF LOATHING IT MIGHT BE WANTING TO END THE PAIN MIGHT IF HE STARTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF IT CAN BE THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S DANGEROUS THE PETER I THINK SO I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS A SIGNAL OF DISTRESS WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS RESEARCH IT'S OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THEY PROBABLY TO PIN TWO MAJOR CHANGES IN YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES THE FIRST IS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INTERNET AND WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF THAT ON YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES
SOMETIMES IT'S A VERY POSITIVE WAY BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF ACCESS TO PEER SUPPORT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT SIDE OF A PARTICULARLY TOXIC FULL OF BULLYING QUITE UNLIKELY I THINK THAT'S REALLY WORKING ON THE SORT OF THING YES YOU REMEMBERED YOU WERE TEN AT SCHOOL BUT YOU'VE GOT AWAY FROM HOME YOU WENT HOME AND IT STARTS WITH CYBER BULLYING IT'S TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK
THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IS THAT THIS RESEARCH COVERED A PERIOD DURING THE RECESSION AND WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC PEUT PIER TO BE COMIC TO DEPRESSION HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND ALL FAMILY DISTRESS AND THIS REPORT PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM ECONOMIC DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS WHO EQUALLY VULNERABLE
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT CAN RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I'D LIKE TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO YOUNG MINDS AS A VERY HELPFUL SOURCE INFORMATION WITH VARIOUS VIDEOS ARE LEAFLESS COLLEGE WORK WITH YOUNG MINDS AND CHARLIE WELL THE TRUST TO PREPARE THAT HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND SELF ON BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN
PEOPLE PANIC WHEN THEY REALISE THAT THEIR CHILD IS AN ANNIE SURE VIEW THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES OFF WELL I THINK THAT WE'RE MISSING A TRICK I THINK WE DON'T INTERVENE EARLY ENOUGH SO I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION IS WE'RE NOT WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS AND THERE WAS A REPORT ON THIS YESTERDAY TOO
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES LIKE CYBER BULLYING TO TRY AND STOP ANXIETY IN ITS TRACKS BEFORE IT DEVELOPS INTO SOMETHING REALLY REALLY PERNICIOUS SO WE DON'T INTERVENE EARLY ENOUGH WE WAIT UNTIL A YOUNG PERSON HAS A DREADFUL PROBLEM AND THEN WE TREAT IT WHY AREN'T WE GETTING IN EARLIER SO I MIGHT BE TOO LATE I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP THERE FORGIVE ME WE ARE OUT OF TIME THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED PETER HENDLEY AND SALLY ON
IT'S SIX MINUTES TO NINE NEWLY DISCOVERED FOOTAGE OF DAVID HADN'T EARLIES ZOO QUEST ADVENTURERS WILL BE BROADCAST TONIGHT ON B. B. C. FOR THE FILM'S DATE FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN GOING OUT INTO THE WILD TO CAPTURE AN EXOTIC ANIMAL FOR A ZOO WAS COMMONPLACE HERE'S A BIT OF THAT ORIGINAL ZOO QUEST WITH THE YOUNG ATON BY RECOUNTING THE CAPTURE OF A COMMODE OR DRAGON
NOW WE HAD TO SET ABOUT BUILDING
ALL THE MATERIALS YOU NEED TO MAKE IT CAN BE OBTAINED IN THE FOREST ITSELF
HE PUT A PIECE OF GOAT'S FRESH SIGN AND THEN SHUT HOW DID THAT END WITH PALM
YOU WAITED BUT NOT FOR LONG WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THERE WAS A RUSTLE IN THE BUSH AND THERE WAS THE DREAD
WE'RE JOINED NOW BY DOCTOR ROS CLUB THE SENIOR SCIENTIFIC OFFICER AT THE R.S.P.C.A. AND BY PROFESSOR DAVID FEEL THE ZOOLOGICAL DIRECTOR AT Z. A CELL WHICH RUNS LONDON ZOO AND WHIPSNADE ZOO GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH GOOD MORNING ROSS CLUB HOW DIFFERENT IS IS A RESPONSIBLE ZOO TODAY TO DISEASE OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT TIMES HAVE CHANGED IN THE ZOO QUEST SERIES YOU DO SEE THAT WE'RE GOING OUT
AS IT WAS DONE AT THE TIME GOING TO COLLECT WHATEVER ANIMALS YOU FIND TO SHIP THEM BACK AND THEN DISPLAY THE ONES THAT SURVIVED THE TRIP AND ALTHOUGH TIMES HAVE CHANGED IN TERMS OF GOT BETTER PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS IN ZOOS THERE'S MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED AND THE RAYS STILL QUITE RELIANCE ON TAKING ANIMALS FROM THE WILD BECAUSE THE MOST Z. POPULATIONS AREN'T SELF SUSTAINING WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T BREED ENOUGH TO REPLACE THE ONES THAT DIE
SO SOME ANIMALS LIKE ELEPHANTS FOR INSTANCE ARE DUE TO DIE OUT IN THE NEXT FEW DECADES IF NOTHING'S DONE ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE STILL OUR ELEPHANTS BEEN IMPORTED TO REST FOR INSTANCE SO THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS A CASE FOR CAPTURING SOME ANIMALS IN THE WORLD AND BRINGING THEM TO A ZOO IN TERMS OF KEEPING THE CAPTIVE POPULATION GOING I WOULD QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S A REAL CONSERVATION BENEFITS BECAUSE DISEASE ARE ACTUALLY CONSUMING THE ANIMALS FROM THE WILD RATHER THAN PRODUCING THEM SO FROM A CONSERVATION PROSPECT I THINK IT'S QUESTIONABLE O.K. DAVID FEEL DO YOU STILL DO
THAT WOULD PRODUCE ONE GAUGE IN THE PRACTICE OF CAPTURING ANIMALS FROM THE WORLD AND BRINGING THEM TO Z. AS WELL THE LAST ANIMALS THAT WE TOOK FROM THE WILD WERE ACTUALLY SOME VIETNAMESE MAGNOLIA SNAILS WHICH WERE ASKED WE WERE ASKED TO TAKE BY THE VIETNAMESE NATURAL HISTORY AUTHORITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE SO ENDANGERED THEY WANTED TO USE OUR EXPERTISE IN BREEDING THEM SO THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY PUT THEM BACK IN THE WILD AND THAT'S THE CRUCIAL ASPECT
WE WOULD ONLY SUPPORT TAKING ANIMALS FROM THE WILD WEATHER IF THEY ARE PART OF A BROADER CONSERVATION PROGRAMME WITH WILDLIFE AUTHORITIES TAKING THEM FROM THE WILD AS CONSUMERS AND I AGREE WITH ROSS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE
IS THAT THERE IS THAT THE WAY TO DRAW THE LINE THEN WAS TO ACCEPT THAT OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT SAID A CELL IS AT THAT THERE ANY PRACTICES WHETHER IN THE WAY THEY RUN THE OTHER WAY THEY THEY BRING ANIMALS IN THAT YOU FIND OBJECTIONABLE I MEAN I THINK THE IT'S TRUE AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR FROM DAVID IN THAT IT HAS TO BE PART OF A REAL CONSERVATION BENEFITS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NOW KNOW THAT IF YOU TAKE ANIMALS FROM THE WILD IF THERE'S GOING TO BE IN A REINTRODUCTION YOU REALLY NEED TO KEEP THEM IN CAPTIVITY FOR AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE
AND YOU NEED TO GET THEM OUT IN ORDER TO HELP THAT POPULATION IS OTHERWISE THEY WON'T SURVIVE THE CHANGE SO EFFECTIVELY START BREEDING THEM OUT FROM THE ANIMALS THAT DO BEST IN CAPTIVITY AND THEY CAN DEVELOP ABNORMAL BEHAVIOURS WHICH COULD ACTUALLY BE DETRIMENTAL IF YOU WERE TO RE INTRODUCE THEM THAT'S SOMETHING I TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FIELD ABSOLUTELY OUR PROGRAMMES ARE A BREEDING PROGRAMMES ARE BASED ON VERY SERIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC AND GENETIC PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO THE PRESERVATION OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR
BUT REINTRODUCTION IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF WHAT WE DO AND WHEN WE START TO PLAN A REINTRODUCTION FOR INSTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANIMAL LEOPARDS IT'S STILL TEN YEARS AWAY IT'S SUCH AN INTENSIVE DISCIPLINE AND INTENSIVE SCIENCE IT'S A REALLY SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO BUT MANY OF THE INTRODUCTIONS
MAY NOT MAY NOT INVOLVE THAT WE JUST REINTRODUCE PARTULA SNAILS BACK TO TAHITI AND WE JUST PUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO SNAILS BACK IN THE WILD AS FRESHWATER FISH THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF SPECIES THAT BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR ETHOS IS ENTERTAINMENT ALL SPECTATOR ENJOYMENT
PART OF WHAT YOU DO YOU'RE NOT ALL ABOUT CONSERVATION ARE YOU WE'RE ALL ABOUT CONSERVATION WERE ALL ABOUT EDUCATION AND OF COURSE COMING TO THE ZOO NOT DENY THAT ENTERTAINMENT OR SPECTATOR ENJOYMENT IS PART OF IT NOT AT ALL BECAUSE THAT MAKES PEOPLE VALUE ANIMALS MUCH MORE IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO THE ZOO AND THEY'D SEE AND THEY ENJOY THE ANIMALS AND SEE THESE AMAZING CREATURES
PEOPLE START TO VALUE BIODIVERSITY A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THROUGH THAT MODEL WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LONG TERM FINANCING LONG TERM SUPPORT TO CONSERVATION EDUCATION INSPIRATION OF A MAPPED BY OF THE NATURAL WORLD IS A HUGE ROLE FOR SUE'S IS THAT RIGHT I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES SHOW THAT PEOPLE GO TO THE ZOO STILL FOR AN TEA OUT PROGRESS THEY DID IN THE SIXTIES WITH HER FAMILY
AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT ZOOS HARVEST TRYING TO MEET THEIR OBJECTIVES OF CONSERVATION EDUCATION RESEARCH WHEN THE MAJORITY PEOPLE HAVE GONE THERE FOR A NICE DAY FOR THE KIDS AND I THINK THAT IS A CHALLENGE IT'S THE NICE LATER THE KIDS DOES HELP THE KIDS OR INDEED THE ADULTS VALUE THE ANIMALS THEY SEE THOSE QUITE SCANT EVIDENCE I WOULD SEE THERE REALLY HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN TERMS OF EDUCATING OR INFLUENCING THEIR BEHAVIOUR SO THAT THE CURE FURTHER FOR THE COT FOR ANIMALS
BUT MY REAL CONCERN US IF ANIMALS EXPERIENCE PRO WELFARE INTERVIEWS THEN IT REALLY DOES QUESTION WHY ARE THERE IF THEY ARE AREN'T SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH DOCTOR ROS CLUB OF THE R.S.P.C.A. AND PROFESSOR DAVID FIELD THANK YOU BOTH AND SUE QUESTION COLOUR IS ON B. B. C. FORD AT NINE O'CLOCK TONIGHT AND THAT IS IT FROM US OUR EDITORS WERE JOHN NEAL AND ADAM COMISKEY FROM US GOOD MORNING
