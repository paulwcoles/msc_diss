WE'VE NEVER SAID THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME RADICAL DECLINED THAT WE'RE GONNA SHUT THE DOOR LET ALONE THAT THE STATUS OF ANYONE ALREADY HERE IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED THAT'S COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED WAS CONTROL WHAT THEY WANTED

THE NEW MULTI MILLION DOLLAR ANTI DOPING LABORATORY WAS DESCRIBED TO THE B. B. C. BY BRAZILIAN SCIENTIST RECENTLY AS STATE OF THE ART AND FULLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH HER LATEST EFFORT BY DRUGS CHEATS TO DEFEAT THE MONITORING SYSTEM

FOOTBALL WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND WILL FACE EACH OTHER THIS EVENING IN THE FINAL SIXTEEN OF EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS HAVE ARRIVED IN PARIS TO WATCH THE MATCH OUR FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT JOHN MONEY IS THERE
SO THE UNITED KINGDOM CONTINUES TO DOMINATE EUROPE PARIS'S PARC DE PRANCE WILL NEVER HAVE EXPERIENCED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS BUT FRANKLY NEITHER OF WALES IN NORTHERN ISLAND IT'S THE FIRST TIME THEY FACED EACH OTHER ON A STAGE LIKE THIS IT'S A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR THE TWO MANAGERS WALES CHRIS COLEMAN AND NORTHERN IRELAND'S MICHAEL AND THE ODDBALLS TAKING CHARGE OF A TOURNAMENT KNOCKOUT MATCH FOR THE FIRST TIME
O'NEILL WAS QUICK TO LABEL WALES AS THE FAVOURITES COLEMAN SAYS THEY'RE LOOKING FURTHER AHEAD IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP THAN THE CHALLENGE NORTHERN ISLAND WILL PROVIDE BUT ONE THING'S FOR CERTAIN FROM THIS THAT THE U.K. WILL FEATURE IN THE QUARTER FINALS

THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE DAILY MIRROR SUMS IT UP IN SIX WORDS ON ITS FRONT PAGE THIS MORNING SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS NEXT ASSIST ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH IS GOING TO TELL US IN THREE MINUTES AND I WISH I COULD JUGGLE ANYTHING I CAN HONESTLY SAY IS NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT BECAUSE
WE HAVE AN EFFECT WALK THROUGH A DOOR AND WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT I THINK WE WE CAN SEE TWO PROCESSES BEGINNING ONE IS THE TUSSLE OVER THE TIMETABLE FOR ART
DEPARTURE WITH VARIOUS E.U. LEADERS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS MAKING IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THEY WANT A NEGOTIATED PROCESS TO BEGIN NOW THEY WANT TO HANG AROUND OVER THERE IS THE BRAKES ARE TEARS HAVE SAID WE'LL TAKE UP TIME WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE INTERESTED AND BEGINNING TO TALK I THINK REALISTICALLY
THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNLIKELY ACTUALLY TO BEGIN UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN WE'VE GOT A NEW PRIME MINISTER BECAUSE FREDDIE SO POINT TALKING TO MISTER CAMERON HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN IT HE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE AND ALSO WESTMINSTER AND BRUSSELS ARE ABOUT TO PACK THEIR BAGS AND GO ON HOLIDAY SO I THINK THAT PROBABLY WON'T BEGIN UNTIL OCTOBER THE SECOND PROCESS THAT BEGINS AS THE TUSSLE FOR THE TORY CROWN AND THEY'RE ALL EYES ARE ON WHO IS THE STOP BORIS CANDIDATE AND THE PERSON IN THE FRAME FOR THAT IS THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY
ADOPTED A SORT OF SNAKELIKE PROFILE DURING THIS REFERENDUM WITH VERY LIMITED INTERVENTIONS BUT SHE WOULD BE THE SORT OF RELUCTANT REMAIN CANDIDATE TO TAKE ON BORIS JOHNSON BUT YOU HAVE TO SAY IT'S VERY HARD TO SEE HOW ANYONE STOPS MISTER JOHNSON BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS WILL BE DECIDED BY THE PARTY FAITHFUL AND HE IS THE PARTY DARLING
AND HE DESPERATELY DESPERATELY WANTS THE JOB THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARTY FAITHFUL AS YOU PUT IT
AND THE PARTY'S M.P.S WERE THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER AT MY JOHNSON'S ROLE IN THIS REFERENDUM AND THERE IS A REAL DESIRE TO HAVE AN ANYONE BUT BORIS JOHNSON LEADER
I CAN'T SEE IT HAPPENING BECAUSE WHOEVER IS PUT UP AGAINST HIM COMES UP AGAINST A MAN WHO YOU KNOW
BASICALLY PUT HIS BODY ON THE LINE IN THIS REFERENDUM HE CHOSE TO STEP OUT ON A LIMB TAKE ON THE PRIME MINISTER AND FRANKLY HE BORROWED LARGE I THINK ALMOST TURNED AROUND THE BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGN GAVE THEM A DEGREE OF MOMENTUM WHICH THEY SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD WITHOUT HIM SO HE IS THE SORT OF THE VICTOR OF THE CAMPAIGN AND SO HE WOULD GO INTO ANY LEADERSHIP CONTEST WITH HUGE MOMENTUM AND I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO WIN
AND THAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WELL THE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO COMMITTEE OF BACKBENCHERS THEY MEET ON MONDAY THEY WILL DRAW UP THE RULES IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'D LIKE A LONGER TIME TABLE JUST BECAUSE MISTER CAMERON HAS SAID HE WANTS THIS DONE AND DUSTED BY OCTOBER DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WILL BE THEY COULD SAY NO I WE NEED A BIT MORE TIME TO GET THIS ALL SORTED OUT BUT ASSUMING THEY GO ALONG MISTER CAMERON'S TIME TABLE THEN THE M.P.S WOULD HAVE THOUGH YOU HAVE TO NARROW DOWN THE FIELD
TWO CANDIDATES SO ALL THE CANDIDATES BUT THE NAME AND HAD TO BE A SERIES OF VOTES THAT WOULD BE NARROWED DOWN TO TWO CANDIDATES THAT WILL BE DONE AND DUSTED BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT SO BY LATE JULY THEY WOULD THEN BE SORT OF HUSTINGS ROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THEY WOULD BE A. SECRET BALLOT OF PARTY MEMBERS WERE THE FINAL DECISION WOULD BE MADE IN A VERY QUICK WORD IF YOU WEREN'T ON
MISTER CORBIN JOKER FRANK FIELD IN A FEW MINUTES ABOUT HIM BUT A QUICK THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER THERE WHETHER HE MIGHT STEP DOWN ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN THE ONLY THING ONE CAN SAY ABOUT LABOUR IS THERE SEEMS AGREEMENT AMONGST MOST LABOUR M.P.S THEY WANT SHOT OF MISTER CORBIN BUT BIT LIKE A HEINZ BAKED BEAN TIN THERE'S FIFTY SEVEN VARIETIES AND WAYS OF HOW AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT SOME HOPE YOU'LL BE SHAMEFACED ENOUGH JUST TO STEP DOWN OTHERS HOPE THE SHADOW CABINET WILL GARNER SOME BACKBONE AND MOVE AGAINST HIM NO SIGN OF THAT SO FAR
FAILING ALL THAT THERE WILL BE A VOTE AT MONDAY'S P. L. P. MEETING TO TRIGGER A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE ON TUESDAY THAT WILL PROBABLY PASSED AND THEN IT'LL BE UP TO THE CHALLENGES TO COME UP WITH SOME CANDIDATES TO PUT UP AGAINST MISTER CORBIN BUT THE PROBLEM THEY FACE IS AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS WILL BE DECIDED BY THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP AND ALL THE SIGNS ARE THEY STILL REMAIN HUGELY SUPPORTIVE OF MY
MANY BANKS THE TIME'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN SHEFFIELD AND WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CITY TO DECLARE VICTORY FOR LEAVE ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THAT'S WHEN MANY REALISE WE WERE HEADING FOR BREAKS IT BIG BECAUSE THE POLES HERE HAD SUGGESTED THE CITY WOULD VOTE TO REMAIN AND YET IN LINE WITH THE NATIONAL RESULTS FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF PEOPLE HERE VOTED OUT I MET UP WITH SOME UKIP SUPPORTER CELEBRATING IN A PUB IN THE NORTH OF THE CITY LAST NIGHT AND ASKED WHAT THEY HOPED WOULD HAPPEN NOW
THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH IMMIGRATION IMMIGRATION WAS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA AT EVERYBODY I'M EXPECTING AN AUSTRALIAN PUNCHED STYLE SYSTEM
WHEREBY WE TAKE THE BEST OF THE BEST SURGEONS ARE ACCOUNTANTS WHATEVER AND IT IS A SENSIBLE IMMIGRATION POLICY AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT
I'M JOINED HERE IN B.B.C. RADIO SHEFFIELD STUDIO BY THE POLITICAL REPORTER LIZ ROBERTS NOW LIZ IT WASN'T THIS OUTCOME WAS JUST NOT EXPECTED WAS IT IT WASN'T BUT I THINK THE OUTCOME FOR THE HOLE
COUNTRY WASN'T EXPECTED WAS IT AND FOR ME IT WAS IT WAS DEFINITELY A TURNING POINT IN THE EVENING I WAS AT THE ELECTION IN SHEFFIELD WAITING FOR THE RESULTS AND HAD BEEN WATCHING THE NATIONAL RESULTS AS THEY WERE THEY WERE COMING IN
AND LIKE EVERYBODY IN LIKE YOU MENTIONED IT WAS THE FIRST BIG CITY TO ANNOUNCE IT WAS THAT IT WAS GOING FIT FOR LEAVE AND IT WAS EXPECTED TO BE CLOSE WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLOSE CALL AND LIKE THE REST OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE WHERE THEY WERE AREAS LIKE BARNSLEY DONCASTER RATHER IT WERE WEAK WE KNEW THAT THOSE WERE GOING TO BE BLACKS IT VOTES THE STRONGER IN CAMPAIGN HAD EXPECTED THOSE TO BE BRICKS IT VOTE
AND THEY'D ANTICIPATED THAT ANYTHING LESS THAN ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PER CENT FOR THE LEAF CAMPAIGN IN THOSE AREAS WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A BAD RESULTS BUT THEY WERE HOPING TO CLAW BACK
THOSE VOTES IN THE SHEFFIELD AREA AND I WENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE CHEF YOU HAVE WHAT TWO UNIVERSITIES HERE IT'S LABOUR LIBERAL DEMOCRAT VOTERS TELL YET LING IT'S I MEAN IT'S A VERY DIVIDED CITY YOU COULD ALMOST DRAW A LINE THROUGH SHEFFIELD THE DIVISIONS ARE VERY CLEAR IN THE CITY MUCH MORE SO THAN IN OTHER IN OTHER BIG METROPOLITAN AREAS
WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE MOST AFFLUENT PLACES IN THE COUNTRY IN THE IN THE HALON CONSTITUENCY FOR INSTANCE AND THEN SOME VERY DEPRIVED AREAS IN THERE IN WHAT WAS DAVID BLUNKETT'S CONSTITUENCY IN HELL'S BRIGHTSIDE SO THERE ARE CLEAR DIVISIONS WE KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DIVIDING THE VOTE PERHAPS LESS PEOPLE HANGING AROUND IN THE MIDDLE NOT KNOWING WHICH WAY TO GO BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY LIBERAL CITY IT HAS BEEN A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT
GRAND COUNCIL THERE'S A THERE'S A LARGE GREEN VOTE IN THE CITY SO YES A SURPRISE THAT ACTUALLY IN THE END IT WENT THE LEAF WE HEARD OF ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT I SPOKE TO YOU LAST NIGHT TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION HAVING BEEN AN ISSUE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN AWARE OF
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH IMMIGRATION IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITY IT'S ONLY MAYBE TWO AND A HALF THREE YEARS AGO THAT IT THAT IT MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES AN AREA CALLED PAGE HALL THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LARGE INFLUX MAINLY OF OF SORT OF ROME A SLOVAK IMMIGRANTS AND AND THERE WERE TENSIONS IN THOSE TENSIONS WERE TALKED ABOUT
IN THAT PART OF THE CITY AND WE DO RUN STORIES HERE ABOUT PEOPLE IN THAT AREA AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET G.P. APPOINTMENTS IN SCHOOLS BEING EXTREMELY FULL AND HAVING AND HAVING THOSE DIFFICULTIES JUST LIKE YOU GET IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT THEY DO TEND TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND I WENT FOR A WALK AROUND THAT AREA ONLY ABOUT TEN DAYS BEFORE THE REFERENDUM AND THE PEOPLE I SPOKE TO WAS STILL MINDED TO VOTE
REMAIN SO IT DID SURPRISE ME I THINK PERHAPS IMMIGRATION BECOMES A PROBLEM IN IN THE NEIGHBOURING AREAS WHERE THEY SEE THE PROBLEMS HAPPENING IN JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN AND BECOME FEARFUL BUT
I ACTUALLY THINK IN SHEFFIELD PERHAPS IT MAY BE AS MUCH IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE GENERALISATIONS OF COURSE PEOPLE VOTE FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL REASONS BUT ALSO A SORT OF ANTI ESTABLISHMENT FEELING THAT CERTAINLY THE FEELING I GOT FROM THE REST OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE ANYWAY WHEN TALKING TO TO LEAVE CAMPAIGN IS NOT JUST ABOUT IMMIGRATION BUT PEOPLE FAILING THAT
ACTUALLY WHEN I VOTE THIS TIME IT IS GOING TO COUNT BECAUSE IN A PLACE LIKE SOUTH YORKSHIRE WHERE WHERE LABOUR IS SO DOMINANT YOU DO YOU GET A LOT OF
APATHY ABOUT VOTING AND SO I THINK ACTUALLY MAYBE JUST MORE PEOPLE CAME OUT I THOUGHT THIS TIME MY VOTE WILL COUNT AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT COUNT LIZ ROBERTS THANKS VERY MUCH EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN BEING A FEW MINUTES AGO MUCH SPECULATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF JEREMY CORBIN WAS LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY FRANK FIELD IS A SENIOR LABOUR M. P. GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT SHOULD HE DO
IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT JEREMY SHOULD DO BUT ACTUALLY WANT THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND PARTY SHOULD DO AND ABOVE ALL DIANE ABBOTT YESTERDAY I THINK RIGHTLY SAID THAT WHERE A PARTY THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD AT LISTENING TO THE ELECTORATE AND THE ELECTRICS ARE SPOKEN VERY CLEARLY ON THIS ISSUE ABOUT LEAVING IT WAS ABOUT CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS
AND I MUST SAY OF PEOPLE ON THE BRAKES IT SIDE ARE NOW SAYING WE'D NEVER ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO BRINGING NUMBERS DOWN THAT WAS CERTAINLY NOT THE CAMPAIGN THAT I PARTICIPATED IN THAT'S GOT TO THAT IN A SECOND IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST DEAL WITH THAT JEREMY CORBIN FIRST THE VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE PROPOSED BY MARGARET HODGE ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPORT THAT I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO GO AND LISTEN TO IT AT THE DEBATE BUT ONE OF THE GOOD AND EMMA'S THAT WE
IS THAT JEREMY IS THE ONLY SENIOR POLITICIAN WHO HAS TRIED TO GRAPPLE AND PUT FORWARD THEIR VIEWS OVER THAT GROUP OF THE ELECTORATE WHO WERE THE LOSERS BY GLOBALISATION
JEREMY'S PROBLEMS HE PACKAGES THIS WITH A LOT OF OTHER OLD CLOCK WHICH A SERIOUS CLOUT
IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE DEFENCE POLICY THAT WE WILL HAVE TRIDENT WE'LL RENEW TRIDENT BUT OF COURSE WE WON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS HAS OUR OUR SUPPORTERS AND PROBABLY THE REST THE COUNTRY LYING DOWN ON THE FLOOR YELLING WITH RAGE OR JUST SIMPLY CRYING AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT AS THE LABOUR PARTY AS ALL PARTIES IN AMERICA AND IN THE REST OF MAINLAND EUROPE AND HERE IS THAT WE ARE INTO AN ERA OF NEW POLITICS WHERE THOSE PEOPLE WHO
WHO'VE LOST OUT CLEARLY BY GLOBALISATION FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE FOUND THEIR VOICE THROUGH THE REFERENDUM TO SAYING THIS COUNTRY IS ENOUGH IS ENOUGH RIGHT WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT JEREMY HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO
WITH HIS SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAMME IS BEGINNING TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THEY ARE OPPOSED BY THE LOSERS OF GLOBALISATION BUT HE CLEARLY ISN'T THE RIGHT PERSON TO ACTUALLY LEAD THE PARTY INTO ELECTRICALS NOBODY THINKS HE WILL ACTUALLY WIN RIGHT SO THAT CASE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN HE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM AND HE WAS MAKING A SPEECH ISN'T HE THIS WEEKEND THIS MORNING IT SHOULDN'T SHOULD HE SAY WELL THAT'S IT I'M GOING TO GO JUST LIKE DAVID CAMERON YESTERDAY I'M GOING TO GO
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE HIM TO DO THAT AND SET THE DEBATE GOING WITH THAT SORT OF FLAVOUR WITHIN THE PEEL P. RIGHT ONWARDS BUT WE WILL BUT JUST AS A NORMAN SMITH WAS EXPLAINING HOW THE TOURISTS ELECTORATE WILL WORK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE FRONT ONE
IN THE TORY PARTY WOULD BE BORIS OR BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF THE RANK AND FILE TORY ACTIVISTS WE OUI OUR ACTIVIST BASE WAS CHANGED
JUST PRIOR TO THE LAST SELECTION OF THREE MEMBERS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY VERY CLEARLY IN FAVOUR OF SOMEBODY LIKE JEREMY WHO I'M IN FAVOUR OF BUT WE'VE CLEARLY GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO THE PUBLIC THING CALLED AS AN ALTERNATIVE PRIME AND THERE ISN'T ONE AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NOT AT ALL
SO IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE IF YOU WERE TIED DOWN AND FORCED TO CHOOSE SOMEBODY OTHER THAN MISTER CORBIN
YOU'D HAVE TO BE USED AT THAT TIME HE DOWN FORCED ME AND KEEP ME THERE ALL RIGHT SHE CAN'T GIVE YOU THE ANSWER BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT HAVING AN ELECTION IN THE ELECTION PROCESS PEOPLE DO ACTUALLY EMERGE BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS WE DON'T WANT THE SAME OLD CLAPTRAP FROM THE BLAIRITE
I MEAN THERE'S NO MILEAGE AMONGST VOTERS BUT THE SORT OF POLITICS THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROPOSE THERE THERE THERE WE'VE GOT TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE WATCHED THEIR LIVING STANDARDS CUT
WHILE THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THE LIFE OF RILEY THEY'VE NEVER HAD SINCE THE EDWARDIAN COS I JUST PUT A THOUGHT TO YOU BUT THE SERIOUS LEAVE CAMP IN ARE YOU ONE YOU DON'T SELL THIS MORNING LIKE A MAN WHO'S PUNCHING THE AIR AND CRACKING THE CHAMPAGNE
NO I THOUGHT THERE WERE TERRIBLE RISKS ON EITHER SIDE I RESENT THE WAY THE EUROPEAN BUREAUCRACY AND GOING TO DICTATE THE TERMS FOR US EUROPE HAS NO PART TO PLAY IN WHAT WE DO UNTIL WE TRIGGER THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WE START FORMALLY TO RENEGOTIATE AND I THINK THERE'S TWO MAJOR JOBS THAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT AT SOME STAGE HAS TO BE REFORMED AND THE GOVERNING PARTY UNITED
SIMILARLY THE COUNTRY HAS TO BE UNITED BY THE PUTTING FORWARD HAVE A NEGOTIATING TEAM WHICH HAS THE BEST OF OUR TALENTS WHETHER THEY WANTED TO STAY IN OR COME OUT AND THAT TEAM HAS TO MAKE CLEAR TO EUROPE WE'RE NOT ON A RAMPAGE THE DAMAGE EUROPE WE WANT NEGOTIATIONS IN WHICH EUROPE FEELS THAT IT WINS
AND ALSO BRITAIN FEELS AS ITS WINDS THAT HAS ONE GIVEN THE MANDATE THAT NOW AS BEEN VERY CLEARLY GIVEN BY THE ELECTORATE THAT ELECTRIC JOHNNY'S ACTUALLY DIVIDED I MEAN FAMILY SO I'M CLOSE TO HIM BIRKENHEAD NO NOBODY WHO VOTED TO LEAVE
AND YET A MILE AWAY ONE SAW A SIGHT I'VE NEVER SEEN IN BIRKENHEAD WHERE PEOPLE WHO DON'T NORMALLY THEY WERE QUIETLY WAITING IN THE ROAD TO TO TO TO CROCODILE THEIR WAY INTO THE POLLING BOOTH TO VOTE AND THEY WERE CLEARLY VOTING TO LEAVE THEM THAT WAS A A MESSAGE
ABOUT TO US HOW DO YOU IT WITHIN A CONSTITUENCY THAT SO DIVIDED HOW DO WE ACTUALLY BRING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER WHICH IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE COUNTRY FRANK FIELD THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN BRITAIN USED TO HAVE A TRIPLE A. CREDIT RATING MEANING IT WAS SOLID AND INVESTMENT AS YOU COULD GET
THAT WAS DOWNGRADED BY THE CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY MOODY'S BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO A ONE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT A DEBT AND NOW THAT HE'S AT RISK WILL COLIN ELLIS IS THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF CREDIT STRATEGY MOODY'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANS THIS ADDING OF THE WORDS NEGATIVE OUTLOOK TO AH OUR CREDIT RATING
OF COURSE SO OUR RATINGS ARE KIND REFLECT THE RANK ORDERING OF CREDIT RISK WHEN WE LINE UP DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS OR OR COMPANIES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND WHAT WE DO WITH THE OUTLOOKS AS WE EXPRESS THE KIND OF LIKELY DIRECTION OF TRAVEL FOR THE RATINGS OR YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS THE KIND A BALANCE OF RISKS AROUND CREDIT STANDING GOING FORWARDS
SO THE LEICA AND SO BY ADDING NEGATIVE OUTLOOK THE LIKELY NEXT DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS DOWN YES INDEED WHAT WAS WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THAT FOLLOWING THE VOTES THIS CLEARLY IT LIKELY TO BE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE U.K.'S CREDIT STANDING BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THAT IMPACT WILL BE IT COULD END UP BEING QUITE SLIGHT
IF THE U.K. AND THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COME TO A FAVOURABLE AGREEMENT IT COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED IF NEGOTIATIONS ARE MORE PROTRACTED ALL WEEK WE COME TO A LESS FAVOURABLE UNDERSTANDING O.K. SO IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY AT THIS STAGE RATHER THAN ANY ACTUAL EFFECT OF THE VOTE
THE UNCERTAINTIES THE BIG DRIVER BUT UNCERTAINTY HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES SO WE EXPECT SPENDING DECISIONS BY HOUSEHOLDS AND FIRMS HIRING DECISIONS AS WELL TO BE DELAYED THE OPTION VALUE OF WAITING GOES UP WHATEVER UNCERTAINTY RISES SO EXPECT TO LOOK AT THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT AND CONFIDENCE THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON GRACE AND THAT CLEARLY AFFECTS THINGS LIKE THE DEBTS G.D.P. RATIO
THERE IS ALSO A CHALLENGE FOR THE U.K. AUTHORITIES IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH WE PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT ON THE ABILITY OF SOVEREIGNTY ABILITY OF COUNTRIES TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AS CREDIT CHALLENGES ARISE NOW THE U.K. HAS A VERY STRONG INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT HAS NOT CHANGED WITH THE VOTE BUT THE SCALE OF CHALLENGES FACING
U.K. POLICY MAKERS AND INSTITUTIONS IT IS ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED HIT JUST IN TERMS OF TRYING TO UNPICK ALL THE LINKAGES BETWEEN YOU CANED LAW FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DRINK TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CHANGE AND IT'S ONE THING TO SAY OH LOOK THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO THINKS WE'RE NOT QUITE AS GOOD A BET AS WE USED TO BE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE WHAT WE PAY MORE IF WE WERE IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO ISSUE BONDS YES I MEAN TYPICALLY A HIGHER CREDIT RATING IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CHEAPER BORROWING COSTS FOR GOVERNMENTS
AND THAT MATTERS THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT BORROWING RATE IS NORMALLY THE BENCHMARK IT'S THE INTEREST RATE OR WHICH OTHER INTEREST RATES IN THE ECONOMY A SET SO A LOWER RATING WOULD TYPICALLY CORRESPOND THE HIGHER BORROWING COSTS AND THAT WOULD BE FELT
NOT JUST BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT BY BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS OVER A LONGER TERM
COLIN ELLIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ALI LET'S HAVE SOME SPORT GOOD MORNING THEY WERE ON OPPOSING SIDES OF THE E.U.

AGAINST ITS WILL SHE SAID HER SECOND INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM WAS HIGHLY LIKELY
AT LEAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN FLOODING IN THE U.S. STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT POWER AFTER TEN INCHES OF RAIN FELL ON PARTS OF THE STATE TWO HUNDRED NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS ARE CARRYING OUT SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORTS AND EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE
THE PENTAGON IS TO ANNOUNCE NEXT MONTH IT'S LIFTING THE BAN ON OPENLY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SERVING IN THE MILITARY THE DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER HAS CALLED THE REGULATION OUTDATED AND HARMFUL
TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO EIGHT FOREIGN MINISTERS OF THE SIX FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE MEETING IN BERLIN TODAY WHAT ABOUT OUR OWN GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SERVICE WHAT ARE THEY DOING WILL ROSS HAWKINS IS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS ARE THEY READY FOR WHATEVER AWAITS US THERE'S A CLEAR PUSH FROM THE E.U. FOR THE U.K. TO GET ON WITH IT I THINK IN THE MESSAGE HAS CHANGED BUT JUST LAST MONTH WE WERE TOLD THERE WAS NO CONTINGENCY PLANNING AT ALL IN WHITEHALL AND OF COURSE THEY'VE GOT TO NEGOTIATE AN EXIT
AND A NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. SIR SIMON FRASER THE FORMER PERMANENT SECRETARY THE TOP OFFICIAL AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND AT THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT A FORMER TRADE NEGOTIATE AS WELL TOLD ME THAT HAVING HAD OUR TRADE NEGOTIATIONS DONE FOR US IN EUROPE FOR SO LONG WE HAVE SURPRISINGLY FEW NEGOTIATORS OF OUR OWN TO SETTLE WHAT TERMS ARE COMPANIES WILL DO BUSINESS WITH THE E.U. IN FUTURE
I DOUBT THERE ARE MORE THAN BETWEEN A DOZEN AND TWENTIES SERVING BRITISH OFFICIALS WHO HAVE REAL EXPERIENCE OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
AND HOW MANY DO WE NEED I WOULD HAVE SAID WE NEED BUT IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL NEED IF WE'RE GOING TO NEGOTIATE WITH EUROPE AND THEN WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE JOHN THOSE HUNDREDS OF EXPERIENCE PEOPLE AREN'T LIKELY TO BE HIDING IN DUSTY CUPBOARDS IN WHITEHALL OR IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NOW HE THOUGHT THOSE NEGOTIATIONS COULD TAKE FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S JUST ONE JOB WHILE THAT'S GOING ON WE'VE ALSO GOT TO WORK OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT UNPICKING EUROPEAN LAW AT HOME
AND HIS PARLIAMENT GIRDING HIS LOINS OR ABOUT TO START GIRDING HIS LAWNS IT'S GOT A LOT OF GIRDING TO DO WHAT AND OTHER OFFICIALS AND LAWYERS HAVE BEEN TALKED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE CUSS REAL DOUBT AND THIS I THINK IT'S THE PRACTICAL REAL LIFE IMPACT OF PART OF THIS ON HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO LEAVING THE E.U. FOR QUITE A LONG TIME SIR ANDREW KHAN HAS BEEN THE BOSS OF THE GOVERNMENT BODY U.K. TRADE AND INVESTMENT HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF E.U. BUSINESS AT THE CABINET OFFICE
HE WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC REMAIN SUPPORTER IN THE CAMPAIGN HE TOLD ME WHAT'S COMING UP IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THE CIVIL SERVICE HAS FACE SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR
THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME REQUIRED TO CREATE THE NEW POLICIES WHICH WILL BE DOMESTIC POLICIES TO REPLACE EUROPEAN POLICIES
MUST BE A DECADES' WORTH OF QUEEN SPEECHES IT MUST FILL UP THE PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
NOW OF COURSE SOMEWHERE ON THAT VISTA THERE'LL BE OTHER PRIORITIES OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE HEALTH SERVICE THEY'LL HAVE TO BE DRESSED AND SO ON BUT BIG NEW LAWS HUGE INITIATIVES FROM GOVERNMENT SAW OPPOSITIONS ARE MANIFESTED A FRANK YOU'RE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO FIND SPACE AND TIME I'M TOLD IN WHITEHALL AND IN PARLIAMENT AS WELL AND ALL OF THIS SUGGESTS IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME
YEAH AND HOW THAT IS ACHIEVED WE FRANKLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE ONE REMARKABLE PROSPECT THAT CIVIL SERVANTS AND LAWYERS HAVE MENTIONED TO ME AND I DON'T FOR A FACT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AT WHITEHALL IS ABOUT THOSE E.U. REGULATIONS THAT TAKE DIRECT EFFECTS ON WOOD THAT LAPSE IF WE JUST LEFT HER TOMORROW SO IT MEANS IN THEORY IF THE E. YOU RAN OUT OF PATIENCE WITH US THEY COULD BE THIS GAP WHERE THERE WERE NO RULES AT ALL
I PUT TO HIM ABOUT HOW YOU COPE WITH THIS IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE WRITTEN WHOLESALE INTO BRITISH LAW AND THEN WE'D UNPICK THEM ONE BY ONE IT'S SO I AM TOLD THAT COUNTRIES COPE WITH DECLARING INDEPENDENCE FROM GRAND
EMPIRES WHICH IT MIGHT BE PERFECTLY PRACTICAL WAY OF DOING IT BUT JUST IMAGINE JOHN BEING THE MINISTER TRYING TO EXPLAIN YOU GONNA WRITE EVERY EUROPEAN REGULATION TO U.K. LAW TO SCEPTICAL CONSERVATIVE BACKBENCHERS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ROSS AND WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE WITH US IN THE STUDIO A VERY SENIOR SCEPTICAL GONE TO A BIT OF THAT VENTURERS NAME US A BILKO YOU'VE BEEN CAMPAIGNING AGAINST EUROPE OR WHAT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS IN A SERVAL CAT I BEG HIS PARDON
NEARLY THIRTY YEARS YEAH ABSOLUTELY YES AND WITH OTHERS WINS ANY OTHERS IN INDIE BUT DO YOU ACCEPT WHAT TERM ROSS WAS JUST SAYING THAT IT IS GOING TO BE AN IMMENSELY COMPLICATED PROCESS NOW THAT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME WELL IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A SUBJECT WHICH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO VERY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO BUT IN FACT THIS IS A PEACEFUL CHANGE WHICH HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH A REFERENDUM
AGAINST THE TWO FRONT BENCHES OVER A VERY LONG AND PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THOSE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE PRINCIPLE STAND AND WITH WHOM AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE DONE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THEIR CHEATING THE SUBJECTIVE IT'S REALLY BIG BUT I DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE SCALE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE EUROPEAN SCRUTINY ACCURACY I WILL BE OBVIOUSLY TAKING A VERY ACTIVE PART IN ALL THE HOUSE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES DUNG CORRECTLY AND I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT
THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS INEVITABLE BUT IT'S BASED ON DEMOCRATIC CONSENT AND THE BRITISH PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN BUT IT HAS TO BE WORKED THROUGH DOESN'T IT AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM OF THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT EVEN THOUGH WE HAD NO VOTED TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
WE MIGHT STILL BE SUBJECT TO A WHOLE SLEW OF REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES AND GOD KNOWS WHAT FOR YEARS TO COME WILL CERTAINLY WE'VE ALREADY GOT IN MIND A DRAFT REPEAL BILL TO ROUTE TO REPEAL THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY THAT NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO
AND ALSO TO INCORPORATE INTO IS A PROVISION WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT THE LAWS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON EUROPEAN LAW WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE U.K. LAW
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES PEOPLE PIECEMEAL AND SAT SLICE BY SLICE AS NEGOTIATIONS GO FORWARD BUT ALL THIS HAS GOT TO BE DISCUSSED AND THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT WE'VE GOT
MANY MANY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS WE'VE GOT THE CABINET OFFICE WE'VE GOT NUMBER TEN AND WHOEVER COORDINATES THIS WILL CLEARLY HAVE TO BE THE PRIME MINISTER IN NUMBER TEN AND WE WON'T HAVE A NEW ONE UNTIL AFTER AFTER THAT WELL THAT'S RIGHT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND I THINK THIS MUST HAVE PLAYED A PART IN DAVID CAMERON'S THINKING THAT ACTUALLY IS ESSENTIAL THAT WHOEVER DOES TAKEOVER IS ELECTED BY THE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO COMMITTEE WHICH STILL EXISTS AND BY THE GENERAL AND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT BY THE PARK BY THE BELLY BIT BHIODH THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY BY THE CONVENTION CONSERVATIVE PARTY OUTSIDE
THAT PERSON THAT I'M QUITE SURE WHO WILL BE VERY VERY CLEARLY DEFINED A WHO DO YOU WANT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH HAS TO BE LEFT TO THE PARTY AND TO THE ONE YOU'LL BE HAVING ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO'LL BE COMING FORWARD I'M SURE AND THERE ARE SO OBVIOUS CANDIDATES FOR THE EQUALLY AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO HAVE A PROPER AND DEMOCRAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY AT THE MOMENT NOT AT THE MOMENT ALL RIGHT CAN I PUT THIS THE TO YOU THAT I'D PUT TO FRANK FIELD TWENTY MINUTES AGO
YOU'VE WON YOU'VE WON A CLEAR VICTORY AND YET THERE ISN'T A SENSE OF CELEBRATION IN THE AIR DO YOU DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE SCALE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN HISTORIC TERMS IT'S AS BIG AS ANYTHING IN THE LAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS MAYBE TWO HUNDRED YEARS AND THEREFORE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION
THAT WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES IT CARRIES AND QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THAT IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE HISTORIC CHANGES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IT WAS DONE BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND IT WAS THE
BACK BENCHES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHO MANAGE TO
ACHIEVE THOSE RESULTS BUT I'VE GOT SOMETHING WHICH YOU'VE ASKED ME TO DO AND I DIDN'T ASK WELL I GATHER YOU HAVE A BIT OF A PUZZLE I DO I DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE ON THIS DAY BECAUSE THIS IS A PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION REVOLUTION MIGHT READ A POEM THERE ARE THREE THINGS OF SUCH A SORT THAT THEY PRODUCE MERCILESS DESTRUCTION WHEN THEY GET THE UPPER HAND ONE IS A FLOOD OF WATER ANOTHER IS A RAGING FIRE
AND THE THIRD IS THE LESSER PEOPLE OR THE COMMON MULTITUDE FOR THEY WILL NOT BE STOPPED BY EITHER REASON OR DISCIPLINE THAT COMES FROM THIRTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY THEN CALLED JOHN GUY
AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT SORT OF SUMMED UP THE FACT THAT WITH THIS IS SOMETHING HUGE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH HAS HAPPENED AND WHICH WAS DONE BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR WHICH THEY DESERVE THEIR GREATEST CREDIT SO BILL CASH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST FULL ANALYSIS OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT TAKE A BOW BRITAIN IS THE HEADLINE ON THE FRONT OF WHAT'S BILLED AS AN HISTORIC EDITION OF THE DAILY MAIL IT WAS THE PAPER SAYS THE DAY THE QUIET PEOPLE OF BRITAIN ROSE UP AGAINST AN ARROGANT OUT OF TOUCH POLITICAL CLASS AND A CONTEMPTUOUS BRUSSELS ELITE
THE STAR'S FRONT PAGE FEATURES A BULLDOG AND A UNION FLAG AND HAT WITH THE MESSAGE NOW LET'S MAKE BRITAIN GREAT AGAIN THE TELEGRAPH DECLARED THE BIRTH OF A NEW BRITAIN THE PAPER BELIEVES THAT WHILE MANY PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY WORRIED FOR THEIR FUTURES THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC OR BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH OF DAVID CAMERON WITH HIS HAND OVER HIS MOUTH DOMINATES F.T. WEEKENDS FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL ONCE OF UNLESS LEAVES LEADERS
SHOW FAR MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND HONESTY THAN IT BELIEVES THEY DID DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE U.K. IS IN ACUTE DANGER OF LOSING CONTROL IN THE GUARDIAN JONATHAN FRIEDLAND CALLS IT A DAY OF DESPAIR FOR THE FORTY EIGHT PERCENT WHO VOTED TO REMAIN HE BELIEVES THAT WHAT'S BEEN DONE
REGRETTED THE REGRET OF THOSE WHO OPTED TO LEAVE WILL ONLY GROW WHEN BRECK'S IT FAILS TO BRING BACK JOBS HOUSING IS STILL IN SHORT SUPPLY AND A MIGRANT FAMILY STILL LIVES ROUND THERE
EXIT EARTHQUAKE IS THE HEADLINE FOR THE TIMES WHICH SAYS THE SHOCKWAVES SHOOK BRITAIN TO ITS CORE AND HERALDED A BREAK UP OF THE U.K. BUT IN ITS EDITOR OF THE PAPER ARGUES THAT IT IS TIME TO CONSIGN DOOM MONGERING TO HISTORY AND AIM TO REALISE THE EURO SCEPTIC DREAM OF A WIN WIN THE SUDDEN LEAVES WITH WHAT IT CALLS AN EXCLUSIVE ABOUT WHY DAVID CAMERON QUIT IT SAYS HE TOLD HE DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND MONTHS DOING THE HARD JOB OF WORKING OUT BRITAIN'S TRICKY EXIT FROM THE Y. YOU ONLY TO HAVE TO HAND IT OVER TO BORIS JOHNSON ON THE PLATE
SORRY TO SEE MISTER CAMERON GO PEOPLE ASSOCIATE EDITOR TREVOR KAVANAGH SAYS THE P.M. HAS TO BLAME HIMSELF FOR PROMISING FUNDAMENTAL REFORM AND THEN RETURNING FROM EUROPE EMPTY HANDED THE WRITING IN THE TELEGRAPH WILLIAM HAGUE PAYS TRIBUTE TO DAVID CAMERON AS A REMARKABLE AND SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTER HE PRAISES HIS DECISION TO STAY ON FOR SEVERAL MONTHS HAS CHARACTERISTICALLY CONSCIOUS OF THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY AND SAYS HE WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO REPLACE
FRONT PAGE OF THE MIRROR IS DOMINATED BY A PHOTO OF WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS A SAD SAMANTHA CAMERON LOOKING AT HER HUSBAND AS HE GAVE HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH IT'S HEADLINE ASKS SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS NOW
ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH BORIS JOHNSON IS PREPARING A DREAM TEAM BID WITH MICHAEL GO TO REPLACE DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE BUT WHAT HE CALLS A PLOT TO STOP HIM IS BREWING AMONG CAMERON LOYALIST WITH THERESA MAY THEIR FAVOURITE STOP BORIS CANDIDATE
IT'S NOW QUARTER TO EIGHT AND WELL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE I AM SHEFFIELD WAS ONE OF THOSE BIG CITIES EXPECTED TO VOTE IN BUT INSTEAD FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE WHO VOTED HERE OPTED FOR OUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SHEFFIELD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE GILLIAN THOMAS WAS NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED SHE'S HERE WITH ME IN A STUDIO GOOD MORNING AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU SAW IT COME OUT WELL I THINK IT WAS
THERE WAS A A SITUATION OVER THE PRE THE FOUR WEEKS PRIOR TO THE BOAT THE BENEFIT IS THAT I WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO BE IN THE SITUATION OF HAVING THAT CONVERSATION SO WITH CLIENTS BUT ALSO WITH MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER CONFIDENTIALLY ACTUALLY ASKING THEM HOW ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE
AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS THAT THOSE THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO BE IN A SITUATION OF VOTING IN WERE ACTUALLY TELLING ME THEY WERE VOTING OUT NOW FROM THAT THE ACCOUNTANTS THE SOLICITOR'S SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO BE KNOWN THAT THE HOLLAND CONSTITUENTS THAT WE WE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE REMAIN AS
THEY WEREN'T BUT THERE WAS A PRECURSOR TO THIS PROBABLY IN MAY WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE LOCAL ELECTIONS WHO WAS QUITE A SIGNIFICANT VOTE TOWARDS UKIP AS WELL SO MAYBE THE TRENDS WITH HER MAYBE THEY WERE IGNORED BUT IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME WHATSOEVER THAT WHEN THE VOTE BUT I HAVE TO SAY ON THAT MORNING WHEN I SAT IN BED WATCHING THE VOTE FROM SHEFFIELD WITH MY LAPTOP WATCHING STIRLING THAT WAS A PIVOTAL MOMENT BURTON I SUDDENLY REALISED THAT MAYBE WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE THEME FOR THE NIGHT
AND NOW YOU'RE A FINANCIAL ADVISER I AM AS YOU WERE WATCHING STERLING PLUMMET WHERE YOU NOT CONCERNED ALL I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN HOLDING THIS DIALOGUE WITH CLIENTS FOR PROBABLY FOUR OR FIVE TO SIX WEEKS OUT SO HE'D BEEN POSITIONING PORTFOLIOS AND THOSE PEOPLE AS ARE PUTTING NEW MONEY END WE HAD TO PUT A LITTLE BIT AND LEFT QUITE A BIT OUTSIDE ON THE PERIPHERY
JUST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN YESTERDAY MORNING WAS VERY ACTIVE BECAUSE WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FALL BUT LET'S NOT FORGET ON THE FOOT SEE HUNDRED WHICH IS A GLOBAL BAROMETER WE WERE VIRTUALLY ON EARNT PRICES ON FRIDAY THAT WE WERE ON MONDAY THE TRUE BAROMETER OF PROBABLY THE U.K. STOCK IS THE FOOTSIE TO FIFTY WHICH FELL OVER SEVEN PERCENT
IT'S INTERESTING TO OBSERVE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE FOOTSIE HUNDRED COMPANIES THEY ARE PREDOMINATELY GLOBAL ORGANISATIONS WHERE THEY WERE TAKING CURRENCY IN FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
THEY ARE GETTING A BETTER VALUE FOR THAT INCOME COMING IN NOW THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THAT SO AND THINK FOR YOU HERE SITTING IN SHEFFIELD AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR THE WEALTH OF THE HEALTH OF BUSINESSES THERE I THINK THERE'S A GENUINE CONCERN NOW IS THAT WE NEED LEADERS AND PARLIAMENT WE NEED PEOPLE IN PARLIAMENT AND POLITICIANS TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION
I LOVE TO SAYING I FOUND THIS MORNING WHEN HAROLD MACMILLAN MACMILLAN SAID WHAT UNDERMINES GOVERNMENTS SAID EVENTS DEAR BOY EVENTS AND WE'VE HAD AN EVENT WE NEED POLITICIANS NOW TO STAND UP TO BE COUNTED WE NEED DECISIONS TO BE MADE
IF WE'RE IN THIS LIMBO FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE CANNOT GET DECISIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT'S NOT A WHAT EXIT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF IT'S GOING TO BE BREAKS IT WE HAVE TO HAVE A CLEAR PATH IT'S NO POINT FOR BUSINESSES TO BE SUP HERE AND YOU'RE NOT HAVING AN ABILITY TYPE OF BUSINESS IS THAT YOU HAVE HERE ARE WHAT ORTIS SHEFFIELD THE MODERN DAY SHEFFIELD DOING WELL WE WERE IN THE PAST MINING WE WERE STEELWORKS WE MOST LIKE A PHOENIX FROM THE ASHES
WE HAVE A LOT OF SPECIALIST DEALS WITH FAMOUS FOR HIP JOINTS AND KNEE JOINTS WERE ONE OF THE LEADING MANUFACTURERS IN THE WORLD OF THESE AS MOST PEOPLE WILL HAVE A SHEFFIELD ME OR A HIP JOINT IN THEM WE DO AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN HIT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED ON OIL PRICE AND THEN WE HAVE STEALS O. K. BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTING ALL THOSE THINGS WON'T BE AFFECTED BY LEAVING WELL
THE HOPELESS THEY WON'T BE BUT UNTIL WE GET CLARITY OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND WHETHER OR NOT THE TRADE DEALS RIDLEY READ TO BE READ NEGOTIATED WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THIS MORNING THE FRENCH ARE SAYING WE WILL NOT RENEGOTIATE A TRADE DEAL WITH THE U.K. NOW THAT IS INTERESTING ONE E.U. COUNTRIES MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT ALREADY OVERNIGHT THAT THEY WILL NOT RENEGOTIATE
WE'VE GOT CONFUCIAN DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WE HAVE CONFUSION THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE GILLIAN THOMAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND DID A CARDIFF STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS A BAPTIST MINISTER GOOD MORNING ROY MORNING JOHN
SO MUCH HAPPENING AND SO FASTER HISTORY CHANGING EVENT THE POUND FALLING MARKETS IN TURMOIL TALK OF INDEPENDENCE FOR THE U.K. INDEPENDENCE FOR SCOTLAND AND THE INCUMBENT FOR NUMBER TEN AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE LIES DOWN THE ROAD
JUBILATION AND BEWILDERMENT PRIDE AND DESPAIR THE REALISATION OF THE BRIGHTEST OF DREAMS OR THE MOST TERRIFYING OF NIGHTMARES
AND NONE OF US KNOWS WHAT KIND OF BRITAIN OR EUROPE MIGHT EMERGE FROM ALL THIS AND LIKE MANY CAMPAIGN CLAIMS TALK OF MASSIVE UNCERTAINTY IS NO EXAGGERATION
HOW CAN WE BEST NAVIGATE THE TURBULENCE AHEAD SIMPLY TO KEEP OUR HEADS DOWN WHILE IT SWIRLS AROUND US MAYBE CONTENT THAT WE'VE GOT WHAT WE VOTED FOR OR AT LEAST WE CAN'T BE BLAMED BECAUSE WE WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE
MORE USEFULLY WE MIGHT DIG DOWN TO TAKE STOCK
FOR INSTANCE HOW MUCH GENUINE POLITICAL CONVICTION HUMANITARIAN COMMITMENT OR RELIGIOUS FAITH HAVE BEEN BEHIND OUR DECISIONS HOW MUCH PLAIN SELF INTEREST WHICH WOULD NEED TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED FOR WHAT IT IS
IT'S THE BEST OF OUR MOTIVES WHICH WILL NEED TO BE APPLIED TO THE NEW WORLD WERE ENTERING
AMONG THE MILLIONS OF WORDS WHICH BOMBARDED ME IN THE MONTHS BEFORE THE VOTE WAS A DOCUMENT FROM SOME OF THE MAIN CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS IT WAS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE READERS TO THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE ISSUES AT STAKE AND SENSIBLY DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY WHERE TO PUT THEIR CROSS IT FOCUSED ON WHAT IT CALLED THE REAL REFERENDUM QUESTION
THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE JUST AS APPLICABLE AS WE FACED A DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE NOW EMERGING TO WHAT EXTENT PICK ASKED DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION HANDS OR HINDER OUR ABILITY TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AND IN DOING SO OUR ABILITY TO LOVE GOD
LOVING GOD BY LOVING NEIGHBOUR SUMS UP SAID JESUS ALL THE OTHER COMMANDMENTS SO IT'S A TRIP HOW WE'RE MEANT TO REACT IF WE FEEL WE'VE BEEN WRONG AND IT'S ABOUT THE TOUGH BUSINESS OF FORGIVENESS RECONCILIATION BUILDING BRIDGES TO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN GROSSLY UNFAIR TO US
IT'S ABOUT SHARING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THOSE WITH WHOM WE MIGHT HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON SAVE OUR HUMANITY
IT'S ABOUT DECLAIMING TO BEND THE TRUTH STOKER FEAR USE OUR OWN INSECURITIES TO FRIGHTEN THOSE ALREADY FEELING VULNERABLE EVEN WHEN WE BELIEVE IT'S IN A GOOD CAUSE
THIS WAY OF LIVING AND LOVING IS OFTEN DEMONSTRATED BY PEOPLE WITH NO FAITH COMMITMENT AND IN CHRISTIAN THINKING IT REFLECTS HOW GOD RELATES TO US
IT'S AN UNCHANGING PRINCIPLE NOT SUBJECT TO POPULAR VOTE IN THE WORDS OF SOME PORK THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT LAST FOREVER FAITH HOPE AND HOPE AND LOVE AND THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND ROY JENKINS THE TIME IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT THE SCOTTISH CABINET WILL BE MEETING THIS MORNING TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY SHOULD DO NOW THE FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON SAID YESTERDAY THAT A SECOND REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE IS NOW HIGHLY LIKELY BECAUSE SCOTLAND VOTED BY SIXTY TWO PERCENT TO STAY IN THE E.U. WAS SARAH SMITH IS A SCOTLAND EDITOR NOW SARAH MIDDLE OBVIOUSLY WANTS AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND
PRESUMABLY SHE WOULD PREFER TO BE HEADING INTO IT ON HER OWN TERMS AT HER OWN TIME HAVING LAID THE GROUND
OH ABSOLUTELY AND SHE MADE VERY CLEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE E.U. CAMPAIGN THAT SHE VERY MUCH WANTED HER REMAIN VOTE BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT IT WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF SCOTLAND TO STAY IN THE E.U. BUT OF COURSE NOW THAT BREAKS IT VOTE HAS OCCURRED SHE WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT THIS MEANS SHE CAN HAVE ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM THERE'S SIMPLY HAVE NOT DECIDED YET TO DEFINITELY GO FOR IT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'LL BE DISCUSSING AT THE CABINET THIS MORNING
BUT IF THEY DO DECIDE TO HOLD ANOTHER FORD I UNDERSTAND THEY WILL GO FOR IT FAIRLY QUICKLY TRY AND GET THE WHOLE THING DONE IN THE SIDE TWO YEARS SO THAT SCOTLAND COULD BECOME AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY BEFORE THE U.K. ACTUALLY FORMERLY LEAVES THE E. U.
BUT IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL IT'S NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT THEY WOULD NECESSARILY WIN ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL SOME SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES IN THE WAY BECAUSE PRESUMABLY ALL THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF LAST TIME REMAIN
SOME OF THEM ONE OF THE BIGGEST UNANSWERED QUESTIONS LAST TIME AS WHAT AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND'S RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE WITH THE E. U. IN FACT VOTERS WERE TOLD REPEATEDLY BY BETTER TOGETHER IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE E.U. YOU HAVE TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE U.K. BECAUSE THEY SAID AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GET INTO THE E.U.
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY FUELLING PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION AND SCOTLAND BECAUSE THEY VOTED TO STAY IN ANOTHER BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE E.U. AND THAT COULD SWELL SUPPORT FOR AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND SARAH SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY PETE WISH HEART WHO'S AN S.N.P. M.P. AND CHAIRS THE SCOTTISH AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
ANOTHER A REFERENDUM HIGHLY LIKELY ON CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT WOULDN'T BE CALLED WHAT UP I'M ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO IS THERE'S THE RESPECT THAT THE SESSION SCOTTISH PEOPLE MEETS JUST FORTY A ROSE GROWERS TOOTH ALMOST TWO THIRDS VOTE AT THAN EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S MASTERS AND DOT AND COMMITMENT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT HAS TO BE RESPECTED AND THAT HAS TO BE PROGRESSED SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR NOW IT'S A FAKE THEN SOUGHT A SOLUTION WHICH ENSURES THAT WE RETAIN A EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP ME SPEAKING TO THE COASTAL MINISTERS TO THE COMMISSION WILL DO THAT
BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY YOU'LL BE THAT RISK HE SECURED WOULD BE TO HAVE A LOOK AT INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM BECAUSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS DEMOCRATS UNACCEPTABLE WE HELPING POOL OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST NATIONAL COLLECTABLE OF COURSE THERE IS ANOTHER ARGUMENT WHICH IS YOU SHOULD RESPECT THE RESULTS OF THE VOTE TO LAST TIME THERE WAS A REFERENDUM WHEN FIFTY FIVE PERCENT SAID THEY WANTED TO REMAIN AS PART OF THE UNIT
THAT FIFTY FIVE PERCENT WERE ALSO AT ALL THOSE WHO JUST CAREFUL SIERRA SMITH THAT THAT WOULD BE DEPEND UPON YOU MEMBERSHIP OF WHAT YOU'LL BE TALL BUT IF HE DID VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE THAT WE WOULD BE BUT IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP NO EVERYTHING'S CHANGED IN THE MOOD UP HERE IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS EVEN JUST FORTY
PEOPLE WHO WERE BETTER TO NORMAL PEOPLE COMPASSIONATELY CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE INNATELY THEM AT THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND WHAT WE SEE HIM AS AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO HAVE THE SORT OF UTAH BUT WHAT
THAT'S WHAT THE SCOTTISH CABINET WOULD BE DOING TO BE THAT WOULD BE ASSESSING ALMOST WAS HAPPENING HE'D WE LOOK AT THE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO US BUT WE HAVE TO STICK THE DECISION THAT SCOTTISH PEOPLE MEET NICOLA STURGEON SAID YESTERDAY THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO LONDON MAYOR'S SIDIQUE KHAN AND SAID THERE'S CLEAR COMMON CAUSE BETWEEN US WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT WHAT SORT OF THINGS COULD SCOTLAND DO WITH LONDON TO TRY TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U.
WELL THIS IS THE REALLY INTERESTING SORT OF MARRIAGE WITH SCOTLAND AND LONDON OF THE NATIONS AND REGION THAT IT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLORING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING JOINT WE WHAT WE CAN DO YOU CAN CHOOSE OUR MEMBERSHIP COULDN'T YOU CONTINUE C'MON TEAM THEY LIKE BUT THAT DOES SEEM TO BE A CENSUS IN LONDON AT THEM AND HAPPINESS WITH THAT AS NO WE ARE IN THE FORTUNATE POSITION WITH NATION
WE HAVE OUR OWN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THEM DOESN'T HAVE THAT OF THE OTHER BOOKS TO THEM BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH EXPLORING AND WE CANNOT JUST TO SEE HOW WHAT SORRY JOINT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAINTAIN THE WATERS ARE BOTH LONDON AND SCOTLAND WILL HAVE THEIR VIEWS RESPECTED
PEOPLE ARE SHOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TIME NOW FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND TO HELEN MORNING MORNING JOHN HELLO THERE NOT A WASHOUT THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS TO BE SOME LOVELY SPELLS
HOWEVER THERE WILL BE SOME HEAVY SHOWERS AS WELL JUST LIKE RECENT DAYS THEY COULD WELL BE SLOW MOVING WITH SOME THUNDER AND UNFORTUNATELY COULD BE SOME LOCAL IMPACT FROM THAT BUT AS I SAY SOME SUNSHINE TOO SO LET'S START WITH THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS AND THE WHOLE OF NORTHERN ENGLAND WHERE WE'VE GOT SOME
GREAT LOW CLOUD TO START WITH AND SOME MIST BUT IT'S LOVELY IN MANY AREAS SOME SUNSHINE THE CLOUD BUBBLING UP THERE THERE ARE SHOWERS AROUND MERSEYSIDE PRETTY HEAVY ONES AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY AND THAT THEY'LL JOIN FORCE ACROSS OTHER PARTS OF THE U.K. AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY NOT FOR ALL SOME SUNSHINE IN BETWEEN BUT THERE WILL BE PASSING SHOWERS AND THEY WON'T MOVE ON VERY QUICKLY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THERE'S LIGHT WINDS SO HAIL AND THUNDER AND POTENTIALLY SOME SURFACE WATER FLOODING SIXTEEN TO TWENTY THOUGH SO QUITE PLEASANT

NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF MIST AND LOW CLOUD THIS MORNING GENERALLY IT'S BRIGHT WITH SOME SUNSHINE THERE WILL BE A FEW SHARP SHOWERS AROUND BUT

COLIN ELLIS FROM MOODY'S TOLD US ABOUT HIS CONCERNS FOLLOWING THE VOTES THIS CLEARLY LIKELY TO BE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY THAT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE U.K.'S CREDIT STANDING BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THAT IMPACT WILL BE IT COULD END UP BEING QUITE SLIGHT IF THE U.K. AND THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COME TO A FAVOURABLE AGREEMENT IT COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED IF NEGOTIATIONS ARE MORE PROTRACTED
THE EURO GROUPS PRESIDENT SAID LIMITED ACCESS TO THE E.U. WAS THE PRICE BRITAIN WOULD HAVE TO PAY AND BRECHT'S IT COULD MAKE SOME BUSINESSES LEAVE THE CITY OF LONDON MY DANCEHALL BOOM SAID RIVAL EUROPEAN FINANCIAL CENTRES WOULD BENEFIT AND ASIAN INVESTORS MIGHT GO TO AMSTERDAM OR FRANKFURT INSTEAD THE UNITED STATES SAYS IT'S ASSESSING HOW THE VOTE MIGHT AFFECT THE PROPOSED TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AGREEMENT

AS THE SHOCK OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT SINKS IN AROUND THE WORLD POSITIONS ARE HARDENING YESTERDAY DAVID CAMERON SAID HE WOULD NOT TRIGGERED THE START OF FORMAL EGGS HAD TALKS WITH THE E.U. THAT WOULD BE A JOB FOR HIS SUCCESSOR BUT THERE'S CLEARLY A DETERMINATION IN BRUSSELS NOT TO DRAG THIS OUT

CANDICE PIERRE REPORTING THAT THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT MANY PEOPLE WILL BE GREATLY RELIEVED THAT IT'S SATURDAY TODAY AND SUNDAY TOMORROW AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE CLOSER THAT AT LEAST GIVES US A BREATHING SPACE IN THE WAKE OF THE REFERENDUM RESULT UP TO A POINT THE CREDIT RATING AGENCY MOODY'S PASSED JUDGEMENT OF ASSAULT SORT LAST NIGHT THEY ANNOUNCE THAT BRITISH DEATH IS NO LONGER AS RELIABLE AS IT WAS BEFORE THE VOTE THE OUTLOOK IS TO USE THEIR WOOD NEGATIVE MEANING WHAT IN PRACTICAL TERMS WELL LET'S TALK TO TWO
LEADING ECONOMISTS ABOUT THAT RUTH IS THE DIRECT ECONOMIC ADVISER THE ARBUTHNOT BANKING GROUP LEAVE SUPPORTER AND DAME FANCY ACROSS FORMER SENIOR ECONOMIST JOURNALIST WHO IS WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOT OFFICIALLY REMAIN BUT SPIRITUALLY I SUPPOSE I COULD SAY COULDN'T I SPIRITUALLY I THINK'S RIGHT THAT'S THE SLOPE RIGHT NOW THEN WHAT DOES IT MEAN
WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE POLLS HE ECONOMISTS THE WHOLE HERD GROUP OF ECONOMISTS IN BRITAIN SHOWED REMARKABLE UNANIMITY IN SAYING THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE BAD NEWS FOR THE FOR THE ECONOMY
AND I THINK IN THE IT IN THE SHORT TIME THAT'S UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LONG RUN IS ANYONE'S GUESS WE'VE GOT A LONG PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY MARKETS HATE UNCERTAINTY THIS IS GOING TO BE OTLEY FINANCIAL TIMES THIS MORNING CALL THE WORLD'S MOST COMPLICATED DIVORCE IT'S GOING TO GO ON FOR QUITE A WHILE WHATEVER WE DO
AND IT'S THEREFORE GOING TO PROBABLY MEANS THAT THE BRITISH ECONOMY WILL GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE AT LEAST IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE BUT THERE IS A BUS
WE ARE THE BIGGEST SINGLE MARKET FOR EXPORTS FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY HAVE WE WON A BIG DEFICIT WITH THEM TRADE OFFICE IT WITH THEM AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE AN INTEREST A REAL ECONOMIC INTEREST IN TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE HAPPY WITH AS WELL AS THEIR HAPPY WITH AND YOU EQUALLY OPTIMISTIC
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE GOT TO MY HOUSE THE RIGHT WORD I'M NOT SEAN THELMA'S QUITE OFTEN IT WILL COME TO THAT MOMENT
I THINK IT WAS A SOMEWHAT GUARDED GOD BUT I'M I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC I MEMORY ACTUALLY EMMA'S CHUFFED AS ANYTHING BUT THERE WE GO BUT I THINK LET'S GET YESTERDAY UM SOME SORT OF PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IF WE REMEMBER A FEW DAYS AGO GEORGE SORROWS HE WHO BROUGHT DOWN THE POUND IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO SAID THAT YESTERDAY WOULD BE BLACK FRIDAY DO WE REMEMBER THAT IT WAS ALL A BIT OF A SCARE MONGERING
ON THE OTHER HE BOUGHT A LOT OF GOLD AND HE MADE A FEW BOB OUT OF IT WE CERTAINLY DID BECAUSE ACTUALLY FRANCIS WHAT WAS EDWIN SHE SAID THE MARKET'S OPEN CERTAINTY ON THE CONTRARY THEY ABSOLUTELY ADORE HIM BECAUSE IT WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY
BUT I MEAN JOKING APART AND THAT WAS A JOKE IN SOME WAYS THIS IS THE POUND HAD COME OFF YESTERDAY LET'S BE FRANK ABOUT THIS BUT IT WAS DOWN TO ONE THIRTY SIX WON THIRTY SEVEN WHICH ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT MUCH MORE THAN IT WAS AT THE END OF FEBRUARY FOOT SHE WAS DOWN WHAT THREE PER CENT OVERALL WHICH WASN'T ACTUALLY A DRAMATIC FALL AND GILKS ACTUALLY DESPITE WHAT THE MOOD IS HAD BEEN SAYING ABOUT DOWNGRADING YOUR OUTLOOK
ACTUALLY FERN JESS TO DO WHICH WAS SOME SORT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THE BRITISH HAD GONE RIGHT WELL EXPLAIN THIS MOODY'S THING BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING IT IS NO LONGER RELIABLE A DEBT IS NO LONGER AS RELIABLE AS IT WAS BEFORE THAT WELL I DON'T NEED THAT ME SURELY THAT WOULD COST US A LOT MORE MONEY TO BORROW MONEY
AS A SAY IRONICALLY GILTS ACTUALLY PHONED YESTERDAY AND GILTS HAVE BEEN FIELDS GREEN WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CELLS IN ORDER TO RAISE MONEY THAT THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT DEBT OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT BOMBS SO IN A SENSE THE MARKETS WERE ACTUALLY BUYING INTO THIS MARKET INTO INTO GILTS DOESN'T CONVINCE ME YOU'RE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT THAT MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT DEBT AND FAIR ENOUGH MOOD DID SAY RESTORE RUNNING A VERY BIG DEFICIT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT'S STILL OVER SEVENTY MILLION
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT DEFAULT ON ITS DEBTS I THINK TAB MIDDLE DRAMATIC FAMILY FRONT AS WELL I THINK THAT BASIC POINT THAT THERE'S NO DANGER OF FALSE IS CORRECT
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE WEAVE THEIR WAY WE'RE GOING WITH SOMETIME IN THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS WE'RE GOING TO HIT ANOTHER DOWNTURN THAT'S THE WAY THAT'S NORMAL ECONOMIES WORK THAT'S NORMAL
WHEN WE GO INTO THAT WE WILL GO INTO IT A BIT WEAKER THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THINGS HAD GONE DIFFERENTLY
THIS WEEK I DOESN'T SOUND EXACTLY APOCALYPTIC DOESN'T IT A BIT WON'T DOES IT A BIT WE COULD ALL SORT OF THINGS MIGHT HAVE MADE US A BIT WEAKER I DON'T THINK THIS IS APOCALYPTIC BUT ITS APOCALYPTIC ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS WE'VE HAD GOT FORD ALREADY TALKING ABOUT CHANGING IT STRATEGY IN THE U.K.
AND FORD IS A BIG NOSE WHO MADE MANUFACTURE OBVIOUSLY UM SO I THINK THERE WILL BE OTHER EMPLOYERS WHO WILL WHO WILL BID MORE HESITANT IN WHAT THEY DO NOT DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT BUT THEY WILL BE MORE HESITANT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE ECONOMY WILL GROW A BIT MORE SLOWLY
AND PEOPLE WILL BE A BIT WORSE OFF ALMOST WHATEVER HAPPENS THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD STAYED IN AND ISN'T THIS THE PROBLEM FROM YOUR LEAVE PERSPECTIVE RUEFULLY THAT
PEOPLE ARE HAVING VOTED TO LEAVE MIGHT EXPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL EXPECT THINGS TO CHANGE FAIRLY QUICKLY AND QUITE DRAMATICALLY IN THEY'LL SEE WHY NO ONE WHAT'S HAPPENED
I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO THINGS AT EXPECT CHANGE SOME CLEAN THEY'VE SUCH AS SOME MAY BUT CERTAINLY I DON'T I MEAN MY VIEW VERY MUCH AND BY THE WAY I'M COMPETING WITH THEIR SCREAMING MANOR LODGE OF SCREAMING DOG IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ASK YOU WERE GOING ON AND THAT MUST SEEM TO HAVE A DOG THAT SEEMS TO OBJECT TO THINGS AT THE MOMENT BUT NOT NEVER MIND LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT
THE WEATHER'S NICE BUT JOKING APART AND I'M BATTLING MY WAY THROUGH THIS GOT CONVERSATION IS THAT IT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER COUPLE OF YEARS AND TRADE WILL CONTINUE I DON'T ACTUALLY THINGS CHIP THINK THINGS WILL CHANGE THAT MUCH
AND OF COURSE WHEN WE HAVE A NEGOTIATION YOU TRADE DEAL AS I EXPECT A NEW TRADE DEAL TO BE NEGOTIATED THEM AGAIN I WOULD EXPECT TRADE JUST CONTINUE VERY MUCH AS WE ARE TODAY I THINK THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME HUGE CHANGING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE OF THIS BRIGGS IT VOTE I THINK IT WAS IS NOT IS NOT RIGHT
WELL WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HAD NOT VOTED AS WE DID THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH ALL OF THIS YOU KNOW I HAVE OR HAVE HAD TO COUNTER FACTUAL AND IF WE GREW A BIT MORE SLOWLY OVER THE NEXT
THREE OR FOUR YEARS THEN WE WILL NEVER NEVER NO IS IT WELL WHAT WHAT WE LOST THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY I DON'T THINK WE DO HAVE THE PAST AS A GUIDE WE WE WE KNOW HOW WE DID WHEN WE WERE IN THE EUROPEAN
WELL WE KNOW AND WHAT WE HEAR IT FOR QUITE A LONG TIME BUT WE WERE ONLY REMEMBER WE HAVE ONLY TWO THIRDS ONE THIRD IN A SENSE THAT WE WERE GOING TO EUROPE WE WEREN'T TINGE IN THE SHOWING AN AGREEMENT AND WE WERE TIN ISN'T YOUR OWN SO WE WERE ALWAYS HALF IN HALF OUT AND WE WILL NOW BE HALF OUT AND MAYBE A BIT IN IT WE'RE NOT NOT NOT A LOT BUT I THINK A LOT DEPENDS ON HOW ENRY ARE WHAT DEAL WE CAN STRIKE
WITH THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF EUROPE WHO CLEARLY AT THE MOMENT ARE FEELING EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH US AN EXTREMELY ANXIOUS BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THE DEAL THAT WE STRIKE IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL THAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING AND WHAT DO WE DO IT TO GET AS OPEN MARKET AS WE CAN TO BE AS MUCH PAST STILL OF THE SINGLE MARKET AS WE CAN DO WITHOUT
EXCEPT IN THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR WHICH I THINK WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BOTTOM LINE AND MOST POLITICIANS ARGUMENT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE TRICKY AND WILL HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH WE GIVE WAY ON EACH OF THOSE TWO GOALS WELL WE'D BETTER END IT THERE I THINK WE WILL GO BACK TO RUTH IN CASE YOU STILL FIGHTING WITH THAT THE DOG GOOD LUCK TO HAVE A RECORD FLEA
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JEAN CLAUDE YOUNGER HAS SAID HE WANTS NEGOTIATIONS ON BRITAIN'S EXIT TO START IMMEDIATELY AS HE PUT IT IT'S NOT AN AMICABLE DIVORCE BUT IT WAS NOT EXACTLY A TIGHT LOVE AFFAIR ANYWAY DAVID CAMERON SAID THEY SHOULDN'T START UNTIL A NEW PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLACE IN OCTOBER
FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM SIX E.U. MEMBER STATES WILL BE MEETING TODAY TO START THEIR DISCUSSIONS ON HOW OUR EXIT SHOULD BE MANAGED I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE E.U. COMMISSIONER FOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRS THE FORMER FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER PIERRE MUSCOVY
THIS IS A DECISION WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN DEMOCRACY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S ALSO FORD YOU'RE A BIT DUSK MOMENT AND FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME HAS BEEN A DEDICATED PAUL YOU HAVE BEEN FOR DECADES IT'S SAD BECAUSE MY DEEP FEELING WAS IT WAS BETTER TO VOTE THE U.K. INSIDE DEAR UNITED EUROPE AND THAT IT WAS ALSO BETTER FOR THE U.K. BUT OF COURSE I RESPECT THAT CHOICE MADE BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE NOW
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CHOICE ARE YOU WORRIED BY THE WAY THAT THE MARKETS HAVE REACTED TO THIS THEY SHOULD SOME VOLATILITY IT'S QUITE LOGICAL BECAUSE WE HAVE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH OPENS BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE BRITISH GRAMMYS SOLID IS RESILIENT AND THAT MEASURES CAN BE TAKEN IF NEEDED AND OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ECONOMIES OUR TASK IS TO ACT IN A COORDINATED MANNER
SO THAT WE CAN GO ON WITH A STRONG ECONOMY AS WELL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FOR THE REST OF EUROPE THE EUROPE AT TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE AHEAD THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY EUROPEANS LOOKING ON IN ENVY AT WHAT THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS DECIDED YOU THINK THEY COULD BE A DOMINO EFFECT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER PEOPLE'S INSISTING THAT THEY TOO HAVE A REVEREND NO I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN GREAT BRITAIN IS A REFLECTION
FOR A GENERAL MOOD WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS THERE WAS OR THERE WILL BE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE YEAR YOU WERE IN THE U.K. THE U.K. IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE SHOGUN AGREEMENTS FOR FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS U. IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE EUROZONE YOU ALWAYS ARE
FOR A SOME JUST RETURN ON ITS BUDGET WITH A REBATE AND THERE IT IS NO A FICTIVE LEG RELATIONSHIP A STRONG
AS IN THE REST OF EUROPE TOWARDS DEAR YOU THE E.U. LEADERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THEY WANT RE NEGOTIATIONS TO START SWIFTY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE U.K. SHOULD TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER PAINFUL THAT PROCESS MAY BE TO USE THEIR WORDS WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST THREE MONTHS BEFORE THAT HAPPENS
IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR THE E.U. DO YOU THINK THE TWENTY SEVEN REMEMBER AS WILL HAVE TO DEFINE THEIR OWN ATTITUDE THE NEGOTIATION WILL START WHEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WILL TARGET THE USE OF THIS ARTICLE HE DOES FROM KNOTTY FIVE
ITS INTENTION TO DO SO AS PRESENT YOU HAVE SAID WE NEED TO DO THAT SWIFTLY O.K. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE KNOW FROM WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL A NEW LEADER IS IN PLACE WHICH WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL OCTOBER IS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THE E.U. FACES UNTIL THEN A PROBLEM I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY AND SWIFTLY MORE SWIFTLY THAN THREE MONTHS
WE'LL HAVE A DEBATE WHEN WE SEE ONE OF THE POSITION OF THE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES WE NEED TO HAVE BEEN AND DIALOGUE BECAUSE THE U.K. IS UNTIL THE END OF THAT THEY WILL SHE REMEMBER HAVE YOU BEEN YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
THERE AS WELL RIGHT BUT ALSO DUTIES AND THAT THE TREATIES IS APPLIED TO ALL OF US SO THE UNCERTAINTY IT IS THAT CONCERN REALLY FROM THE E.U. THAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT BECAUSE OF COURSE THE EFFECT OF THIS VOTE TO LEAVE HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS ON OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES DOESN'T IT
YES BUT THE SAME TIME WOULD MUCH BIG THAT FOR THOSE WHO REMAINED SO DO YOU BUT DO YOU OCCASION TO HAVE A FRESH START
THEY ARE PROBLEMS ARE NOT SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAN IN THE U.K. BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO GIVE MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO ECONOMIC SOCIAL
IF YOU CALL CHALLENGES AND ALSO FOR THOSE COUNTRIES WILL SHARE THE EURO TO STRENGTHEN YOUR RESULT WHICH IS A MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL IN ORDER TO BUILD A EUROPEAN THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TWENTY SEVEN MEMBER STATES ARE AND WILL BE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE YEW AND THE NEED TO GO FURTHER WITH THEIR OWN PROJECT AND TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE
YOU KNOW WE ARE FACING POPULISM ALL OVER EUROPE AND TO FACE POPULISM WE NEED TO GIVE A POPULAR ANSWER WE NEED TO HAVE A POPULAR AT EUROPE
AND THAT MEANS FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING MORE EUROPE NOT LESS MORE BUT ALSO DIFFERENT AND BETTER WE NEED TO RESPECT FREED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MEMBER STATES WE NEED TWELVE GOOD PROJECTS FOR THE EUROPEANS DO YOU ACCEPT THAT IF THE E.U. HAD GIVEN DAVID CAMERON GREATER CONCESSIONS IN HIS RECENT RE NEGOTIATIONS THE U.K. WOULD NOT NOW BE LEAVING I'M NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THAT AT ALL BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE REST OF THE E.U.
TO GIVE MORE CONCESSION THE BRITS AND THE DRAWER IT'S BETWEEN HAVING A VERY SPECIFIC STATUES INSIDE IN THE E.U. OR GETTING OUT OF THE E.U. THE CHORES BUT I THINK THAT WAS QUITE GOOD AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU KAY
IN TERMS OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK LIKE TWO THREE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE LINE YOU WILL OF COURSE REMAIN IN EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND THE U.K.'S A STRATEGY FOR DEFENCE FOR TRADE AND WE WILL HAVE TO DEFINE
A VERY STRONG AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP OUCH I'M SURE WE'LL MAKE IT DO YOU THINK THAT DAVID CAMERON MADE A POLITICAL MISTAKE NO I'M NOT GOING TO ENTER INTO THE DEBATE I FULLY RESPECT THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE BRITISH PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN A HUGE DEBATE THE BEEN YOU WOULD VOTE THERE'S BEEN A HUGE DRAWN OUT AND IT'S A VERY CLEAR RESULT SO O.K. IT'S NOT UP TO ME TO SAY WHO IS TO BLAME
AND DAVID CAMERON FOR THE TIME BEING HE'S THE PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN AND WE WERE GOING TO WORK WITH HIM
MUSCOVY ZI TALKING TO ME EARLIER WELL THERE'S THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE THINK TANK OPEN EUROPE THEIR DECLARED THEMSELVES TO BE NEUTRAL IN THE REFERENDUM GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING NOW YOU'VE LOOKED AT THE HOT WAY THAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS SHOULD WORK FIRST OF ALL IT IS ONLY THE U.K. WHO CAN TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY ISN'T IT SO IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE E.U. THE U.K. HAS THE UPPER HAND
THE U.K. HAS COMPLETE CONTROL IN TRIGGERING THE LEAVING PROCESS AN ARTICLE FIFTY AS YOU SAY BUT THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THE Y. YOU CAN APPLY PRESSURE AND WE ARE ALREADY SEEING SOME OF THEM THEY ARE APPLYING PRESSURE TO MOVE QUICKLY I THINK CRUCIALLY THEY'RE SENDING SIGNALS THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY REAL INFORMAL TALKS SO MUCH DISCUSSION BEFORE ARTICLE FIFTY AND THE PROCESSES FORMALLY TRIGGERED AND THEREFORE TO BRING THEM TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE U.K. HAS TO TRIGGER A SCHOOL FIFTY AND THAT'S WHEN THE TICKING CLOCK STARTS I THINK ONCE THE CLOCK STARTS ACTUALLY THE POWER SHIFT BACK TO THE EUROPEAN SIDE SO WHILE YOU HAS CONTROL AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE TIME YOU'RE PUTTING ARTICLE FIFTY IS QUITE CRUCIAL
BUT I SUPPOSE THE DIFFICULTY FOR THAT IS THAT THE LEAVES SIDE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF WHAT LEAVE ME
EXACTLY I THINK IT WILL BE SOME TIME UNTIL OSCAR FIFTIETH HIM NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP QUESTION BUT ALSO AS YOU SAY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR PLAN IS AND LEAVE SIDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN QUITE DIVIDED THERE HAVE BEEN THESE MORE LIBERAL LIBERTARIAN OPEN GLOBAL EST LEAVERS WHO WANT TO LEAVE KEEP HIGH IMMIGRATION OPEN UP TO THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE MORE UKIP SIDE WHICH IS ANTI IMMIGRATION WANTING TO HAVE A MUCH TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS BUT ALSO MUCH MORE PROTECTIONIST AND ECONOMIC TERMS PROBABLY WANT TO MOVE BACK TO
NATIONALISING SOME FOR INDUSTRIES SO THAT CONFLICT HAS TO BE RESOLVED AND IT'S NOT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW THAT WILL BE FINALISED AND WHAT OUR PLAN WILL BE GOING INTO LEAVING PROCESS YOU SPEAK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE SINCE THE VOTE AND SEEM INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT THAT THAT FREE TRADE WILL NOT CHANGE IS THAT CONFIDENT MISPLACED
I THINK THERE IS SOME PRECEDENTS FOR THAT CONFIDENCE IF WE LOOK AT THE E.U. IT HAS THIRTY PLUS TRADING BEINGS WITH SIXTY PLUS COUNTRIES AND THEY ALL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TRADING GOODS SO I THINK THAT FREE TRADING GOODS WOULD LIKELY BE IN AGREEMENT IT'S UNLIKELY WHOOPSIE TARIFFS GOING UP AND THINGS LIKE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS THE WAY IT WILL GO BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS FREE TRADE IN SERVICES AND PARTICULARLY IN FINANCIAL SERVICES
THAT IS MUCH LESS CERTAIN THERE'S LESS PRESTON'S FOR A COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE E.U. HAVING FULL ACCESS TO THE MARKET IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND SERVICES WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AS AS THEY ARE FROM THE E. SO I THINK WHILE FREE TRADE IN GOODS LOOKS LIKE THERE IS EVIDENCE TO CONTINUE SERVICES IS MUCH LESS CERTAIN ROW ROOP THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIDE IS OUT TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND HE WAS FINALE WOULD SUPPORT GOOD MORNING WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE BRITISH TEAM WILL REMAIN IN EUROPE AT THE QUARTER FINALS OF THE EUROS WITH WALES OR NORTHERN IRELAND SET TO FACE EACH OTHER IN THE LAST SIXTEEN OF THE TOURNAMENT THIS AFTERNOON BOTH MANAGERS ARE EXPECTING AN EMOTIONAL ENCOUNTER
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT EMOTION TO BE HONEST SO I DON'T EXPECT CERTAINLY MIGHTY INTERPLAY OF EMOTION AND IT'LL BE A BIG FACTOR I THINK IN THE GAME TONIGHT DON'T GET ME WRONG YOU NEED YOU NEED A BIT OF EMOTION BUT IF YOU GET TOO EMOTIONAL THEN YOU GAME PLANS OUT THE WINDOW I SAID TO THE PLAYERS AFTER ENGLAND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE LOST THE GAME BECAUSE WE NEVER
REALLY SHOWED THE OPPOSITION WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OFF MICHAEL O'NEIL AND CHRIS COLEMAN SPEAKING THEIR FORMER NORTHERN IRELAND INTERNATIONAL GERRY TAGGART IS IN PARIS AHEAD OF THE HISTORIC MATCH WHAT A HUGE DAY AT THE EUROS JERRY TODAY'S OUTCOME DEPEND ON WHICH TEAM HANDLES THE OCCASION AND KEEPS THEIR EMOTIONS IN CHECK AS CHRIS COLEMAN SAID
WELL AT MAY WELL DO IN THE END AND TO BE FAIR TO WALES DAY AT THEY'VE GOT ONE UP ON NORTHERN IRELAND ALREADY BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS SORT OF SO CALLED BUTLER BRITAIN ALREADY WITH ENGLAND SO THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH IT ALL BEFORE SO IF IT DOES COME DOWN THERE HE HANDLES THE EMOTIONS
HUMBLES THEIR MOTIONS THE BEST IN WALES HAVE GOT THE UPPER HAND ON THAT AT THE MINUTE AND WALES ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN THE PREVIOUS HEAD TO HEADS HAVING WON FIFTEEN OF THEIR THIRTY FOUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS THEY ALSO FINISH TOP OF THEIR GROUP WITH NORTHERN IRELAND FINISHING THIRD IN THEIRS SO DO YOU SEE WALES AS DEFINITE FAVOURITE
LISTEN WALES AFFAIR WERE FAVOURITES AS YOU AS YOU ALLUDED TO THE HEAD TO HEAD BUT THE THING IS THAT'S NEVER BEEN IN A KNOCKOUT COMPETITION THAT A MAJOR FINAL SO YOU COULD SAY FORM GOES OUT THE WINDOW ON THIS ONE
WHAT I WOULD SAY THE FAVOURITES PURELY BASED ON THE GARETH BALE EFFECT SHALL WE SAY YOU KNOW IF HE TURNS UP TODAY I'M DECIDES TO PUT IN ONE OF THOSE WORLD CLASS PERFORMANCES AND THEN NORTHERN IRELAND COULD STRUGGLE I THINK AT THE MINUTE YOU KNOW GARETH BILL HE'S THE BEST PLAYER IN THE TOURNAMENT
HE SCORED A GOAL HE SCORED A GOAL IN EVERY GAME WHICH MEANS HE'S HEAVILY INFLUENCED THE OUTCOME OF HIS TEAM'S RESULT SO FAR SO NORTHERN IRELAND ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A JOB ON HIM
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY WERE THERE THAT YOUR DEFENCE WILL HANDLE HIM WELL THE ONE THING
ONE THING THAT NORTHERN IRELAND A A A A BELT ON HIS SOLID THE FANTAS AND WE'VE PROVED THAT IN THIS TOURNAMENT ONLY CONCEDED TWO GOALS IN THE THREE GROUP GAMES AND THE TWO ONE GOAL AGAINST POLAND ONE GOAL AGAINST GERMANY SO WERE PRETTY SOLID BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
WE HAD SOME OF GEAR JOHN I'M GARETH BALE HOW HE'D CLAIRE'S WHETHER HE'S MOST EFFECTIVE ON THE PITCH I'M SURE THAT MICHAEL HAD DONE HIS HOMEWORK ON THAT THEY HAVE THINGS CALLED HEAT MUTT THAT THEY'D TAKEN THE CONSIDERATION THEY SO HE'LL HAVE SAT DOWN WITH THE ZONAL LESSON I'M GONE THROUGH ALL THAT
THE INFORMATION THAT GARETH BILL BRINGS UP A LOT WITH THIS HEAT MARK AND IF THEY CAN KEEP EM QUIET THEN WE ARE IN THE GAME THIS IS GOING TO BE IN LET'S HOPE I'M HOPING THAT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY REALLY SPECIAL OCCASION AND A GREAT GAME FOR EVERYONE DO WHAT

DAVID CAMERON IS COMING UNDER PRESSURE TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF LEAVING THE E.U. THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLACE AND THE AUTUMN ADDING IT WOULDN'T BE AN AMICABLE DIVORCE
JEREMY CARBON WILL GIVE A SPEECH LATER SETTING OUT HOW LABOUR SHOULD MOVE ON FROM THE REFERENDUM HE'S INSISTING HE WON'T RESIGN OVER HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE CAMPAIGN NINE OF HIS M.P.S HAVE PUBLICLY SUPPORTED A MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE
SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON IS TO HOLD A MEETING OF A CABINET IN EDINBURGH THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS MINISTERS ARE EXPECTED TO STRESS TO THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN E.U. STATES OVER THE WEEKEND THAT THE SCOTS VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO STAY IN EUROPE
AT LEAST TWENTY THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN FLOODING IN THE U.S. STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT POWER AFTER TEN INCHES OF RAIN FELL ON PARTS OF THE STATE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN IN A CURIOUS MOOD SINCE WE LEARNED THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM ALSO HAD SEEN SOME CELEBRATION THERE MOSTLY RATHER SOMBRE MOOD INEVITABLE PERHAPS GIVEN THAT THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY NOT JUST ABOUT HOW AND WHEN WE START NEGOTIATING WITH THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT WHO WILL ACTUALLY BE IN CHARGE OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE A NEW PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE
BUT WHO'S THAT GOING TO BE JOINED BY SIR ALAN DUNCAN FORMER CONSERVATIVE MINISTER USED TO BE EUROSCEPTIC BECAME REMAIN AND CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR STRATFORD UPON AVON BREAKFAST MY WEE DO YOU WANT
OF COURSE JOHN THERE'LL BE MANY CANDIDATES BUT COME FORWARD THE STRENGTH OF ANY ORGANISATION IS THE QUALITY OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND I THINK
DAVID CAMERON TO HIS GREAT CREDIT AND IT'S WORTH JUST REMEMBERING DAVID CAMERON'S LEGACY IN WHAT HE'S DELIVERED FOR THIS COUNTRY THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE LET'S GET MY MARRIAGE MIND WE GOT IT O.K. LET'S LET'S SEE WHO PUT WHO COMES FORWARD THERE'LL BE LOTS I THINK A VERY STRONG CANTWELL BORANGE YOGHURT IS GOING TO COME FORWARD DO YOU FANCY
BORIS HASN'T DECLARED YET SO YOU'RE ASSUMING THINGS LET'S RUN WITH THAT ASSUMPTION FOR A MOMENT SEEMS A HEADLINE AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS AND THAT'S WHAT EUROPE YOU'RE ANGLING FOR HERE BUT THEY'LL BE OFF THE MINUTES ROUND THE BASE AND I THINK THE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO COMMITTEE GRAIN BREAD WILL MAKE A DECISION ON THE TIMING
ON MONDAY IF IT IS BY OCTOBER THEN WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE CANDIDATES IN PLACE BY THE END OF JULY
A HUSTINGS DURING AUGUST FOR THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE A VOTE IN SEPTEMBER AND OF COURSE A NEW PRIME MINISTER IN WHOEVER HE OR SHE IS RIGHT ON THE TABLE SIR ALAN DUNCAN
DO YOU FANCY BORIS JOHNSON'S A LITTER I'M BLOOD AND OIL MAKING US PROBABLY NOT RIGHT
LOOK I THINK WE'VE GOT TO STEP BACK A BIT AND REALISED WHERE THE FATE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY PROBABLY LIES AND IT IS A MASSIVE MISTAKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE POPULAR ON THE BACK OF THIS REFERENDUM RESULT THERE ARE SOME VERY ANGRY YOUNG PEOPLE
ANGRY PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THE RESULT WERE OF COURSE NATURAL LABOUR SUPPORTERS AND ANGRY WITH YOU FOR HAVING CALLED WITH NO NO NO NO NO NO ABOUT THE RESULT SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS JUST BECAUSE CONSERVATIVES WERE LEADING THAT CAMPAIGN AND WON THE REFERENDUM WILL NOT NECESSARILY CONVERT INTO NATURAL POPULARITY
FOR THE CONSERVATIVE I WAS GOING TO GO BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT DID YOU WE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE REFERENDUM IT WOULD STILL BE CAMERON WHO CALLED THE REFERENDUM I WONDER WHETHER YOU ARE SUGGESTING THERE MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH YOU FOR HAVING THE REFERENDUM IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A BACKLASH ON LOTS OF LEVELS BUT TO ANSWER YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION REALLY ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE LEADER I THINK WE'VE GOT TO APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU WANT PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY EVERY SINGLE CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IS EQUAL IN THIS AND THEY MUST ASSERT THEMSELVES
AND NOT TO BE GIVEN A STITCHED UP OPTION FROM ON HIGH AS A SORT OF SLAM DUNK WHAT DOES THIS IS MY SIXTH AND POSSIBLY SEVENTH ACTUALLY LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN IN WHICH I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AND OFTEN THE POOR DAMNED INFANTRY ARE JUST TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND I THINK WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN HERE
IS THAT EVERY SINGLE CONSERVATIVE M.P. MUST APPRECIATE THAT THEY AT THEIR VIEW MATTERS AND THAT THEY'VE GOT A LOOK AT THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN ALL PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM ON A WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES IF SOMEONE STANDS UP AND SAYS OH IT'S GOT TO BE A REMAIN
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD BE MORE STUPID COS IF YOU JUST LOOK THROUGH THE LENS OF THIS REFERENDUM THAT IS BEHIND US THAT WILL ACTUALLY NARROW THE WAY IN WHICH WE LOOK AT OURSELVES AND WHAT WE NEED IS UNITY STABILITY CREDIBILITY AND COMPETENCE SOMEONE HAS GOT TO BE GOOD ON DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY AND BE ABLE TO STAND ON THE WORLD STAGE WITH DIGNITY AND EFFECTIVENESS EQUALLY THEY SHOULDN'T SAY IT'S GOT TO BE A BLACK CITY
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID A REMAIN ARE YOU I SPOKE I TOTALLY MISSED I DO OUTSIDE ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT WELL SPOTTED WELL SPOTTED THANK YOU FOR CORRECTING ME RIGHT O.K. SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE TO USE YOUR WOOD I THINK RAILROADED INTO VOTING FOR BORIS JOHNSON THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY WHAT I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO WORK BUT THEM BY THE WAY I'LL TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER THING DO NOT ALSO ASSUME
BUT HE IS NECESSARILY THE DARLING OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY ACTIVISTS A LOT OF THEM HAVE LOVED THE NOTORIETY AND EXCITEMENT BUT ACTUALLY ONCE YOU SCRATCH THE SURFACE A LITTLE BIT AND ASK THE NEXT QUESTION A LOT OF THEM DON'T NECESSARILY WANT A PERMANENT RIDE ON THE BIG DIPPER
RIGHT WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME WHO YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR BUT DO TAKE THAT POINT THAT ALAN WAS MAKING THERE ABOUT
BORIS JOHNSON LET'S DEAL WITH HIM FIRST WELL
I WOULD STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE CAMPAIGN
WE RAN A VOTE LEAVE SIDE BOTH BORIS AND MICHAEL GO OVER AND ANDREA LET'S HAVE LOTS
THE TEAM GAVE THE LEAVE CAMPING REAL CREDIBILITY
AND I THINK OUR MESSAGE ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH BUT ALSO I THINK BOTH MICHAEL AND BORIS
A GEEZER STUART TO BE FAIR AND JOHN MAN ALL SAID THAT THERE ARE RISKS ON BOTH SIDES WE WERE I THINK VERY HONEST WITH THE PEOPLE AND I THINK IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHICH IS WHERE I'M GOING TO AGREE WITH
THAT WE HAVE TO GOVERN FOR ALL THE PEOPLE YES OF COURSE WE WON BY FIFTY TWO FIFTY THREE PERCENT BUT THERE ARE FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO
YOU THE MAJORITY WANTED US TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR ECONOMY AND TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS AND HAVE A SENSIBLE IMMIGRATION YEAH IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN BUT I'M NOT THAT YOU WERE EVER TOGETHER IN THIS SENSE I SUPPOSE IN ALL TRUTH OF PARTY'S BEEN SPLIT FOR MANY MANY YEARS OVER THIS BUT THIS BOOZE MADE EXPLICIT WASN'T IN THE LAST
TEN WEEKS AND IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO BECOME A SINGLE PARTY AGAIN ISN'T IT WHAT LOOK I THINK NOW THAT THE QUESTION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE HAS BEEN
SETTLED SO THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO IS TO HAVE A NEW LEADER THAT LEAD US TO PICK HIS TEAM
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG NEGOTIATING TEAM THAT TAKES EFFECT BEFORE DEPARTMENT IT'S THE FOREIGN OFFICE THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENT IS THE CABINET OFFICE AND THE TREASURY
AND WHOEVER'S LEADER WILL HAVE TO PUT A REALLY STRONG TEAM FROM BOTH THE REMAINED CAMP AND THE BRICKS IT CAMP TO LEAD THAT NEGOTIATION TO HAVE A GENTLE REPORTING IS SAYING THIS
ALL SORTS OF THINGS SMALL BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT WE HAVE TO BE SENSIBLE ABOUT THIS THAN THE HEAD OF THE GERMAN C.B.I. WHERE ONE IN FIVE OF ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE CARS AND GERMANY COME TO THE U.K. WE BUY MORE WASHING MACHINES FROM A.G. THAN ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
WILL WANT TO DEAL WITH US SO THERE WAS LOTS OF PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE TO DELIVER ON I THINK WE'VE GOT OUR FOUR YEARS OF HER MANIFESTO WHERE WE WANT TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIFE CHANCES
THAT WILL BE DELIVERED I THINK BY A VERY STRONG CONSERVE MY CONFIDENCE IS BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE TEAM THERE ARE LOTS OF REALLY HIGH QUALITY CANDIDATES INCLUDING BORIS JOHNSON WHO RIDING ANY BORIS JOHNSON INCLUDING THERESA MAY
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT A PARTY AND YOU LOOK AT JEREMY CORBIN'S PARTY IN THE LABOUR FIVE NOBLE LET'S NOT MESS ALL RIGHT HE'D BE WILFUL TALKING WAS AT ALL DOES THAT ALREADY BUT WHAT OF WHAT OF WHAT WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED GEORGE OSBORNE AS SIR ALAN IS A DEAD DUCK
WELL HE'S MUCH WEAKENED OF COURSE UM ELLE I THOUGHT WHO VERY IT IN PERSONALLY I MEAN YOU KNOW IF I WOULD STICK MY NECK OUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
ON THE BACK OF THIS I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HIM IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAD HE DONE SO VERY QUICK WORD FROM EACH OF YOU WHEN HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK REALISTICALLY WE SHOULD
INVOKE TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY FOUR FROM TO BEGIN THEIR DEPARTURE PROCESS
I DEEMED DEAD RIGHT ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE A STRONG NEGOTIATING TEAM AND THE TROUBLE IS THE CIVIL SERVICE IN THE DEEP STATE OF PANIC ABOUT THIS THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE OR THE RESOURCES OR RELIEVE THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGENDA TO KNOW QUITE WHAT THE POLITICIANS WHO ARE DIRECTING THEM PROPOSE AND I'M AFRAID ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF THIS IS I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE WHO LED THE BRICKS IT CAMPAIGN REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT HAS TO BE IN DETAIL SO I THINK IT'S WISE OF DAVID CAMERON TO SAY WE SHOULD TRIGGER ONLY WHEN THE NEW
LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER IS IN PLACE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIT OF TIME TO ROLL THE PITCH AND TO UNDERSTAND QUITE WHAT THIS IS ALL GOING TO ENTAIL MISTER YOUNG COOK AND I'M AFRAID JUST WAIT FOR A BIT AND EAT HIS WORDS COS FRANKLY WILL BUT WE WILL HAVE TO DO THIS AT OUR OWN PACE RIGHT QUICK THOUGHT FROM THE WEE ON A GEORGE OSBORNE SIR ALAN SAID HE WAS WE CAN WHAT DO YOU THINK
GEORGE HE'S A HUGE TALENT AND WHOEVER IS PRIME MINISTER I'M SURE WE'LL BE GOING GEORGE BY THEIR SIDE WORKING WITH THEM
WILL MAY HIMSELF WANT TO CONSIDER THAT HIT HIS PUPPET CANDIDATE YOU CERTAINLY ARE
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE GOT GREAT TALENT ALL RIGHT WHAT I WOULD WEAR I WOULD AGREE WITH ALAN IS WE DO NEED THAT TIME THE CHANNEL B. CHANNEL TOMORROW BE TRADING TOMORROW THERE'LL BE LOTS OF COMPANIES IN THE U.K. DOING
REALLY WELL AND I THINK WHEN WE ARE IN THE POSITION TO HAVE A STRONG NEGOTIATING PEOPLE WILL THEN TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY
CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET A STRONGER BY THE WAY I THINK THIS IS AS VOTES TREES THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND THE LIFE CHANCES OF ALL EUROPEANS NOT JUST IN THE U.K. IN SPAIN NO ENTRANCE AND ELSEWHERE AFRAID TO GO INTO ALL OF THAT BUT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH HOW WE ANSWER ALAN
IT'S NOW SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE COME TO SHEFFIELD FOR THE PROGRAMME THIS MORNING BECAUSE IT WAS A TURNING POINT EARLY ON FRIDAY THE FIRST MAJOR CITY TO DEFY EXPECTATIONS AND VOTE TO LEAVE ONE COMMENTATOR SAID THERE WAS ECSTASY IN THEIR VOTE LEAVE OFFICE WHEN THIS CITY'S RESULTS CAME IN
NIGEL FARAGE TWEETED AMAZING STUFF DELIGHTED AND THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED SHEFFIELD TO VOTE REMAIN IT'S BEEN A LABOUR STRONGHOLD FOR YEARS SANCHA BURGERS WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO PEOPLE HERE AND FINDING WHAT
WELL FINDING A RANGE OF VIEWS UP SHEFFIELD'S OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A DIVERSE VIBRANT CITY HOME TO TWO LEADING UNIVERSITIES ONE OF THE BEST PLACES FOR GRADUATES TO START THEIR CAREER BUT IT'S ALSO A CITY WHERE MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE WE'RE SECURE JOBS IN OLD INDUSTRIES HAVE GIVEN WAY TO FAR MORE PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT SO I TALK TO RATHER SHOCKED YOUNG GRADUATE TO A SHELL SHOCKED LOCAL OBRA AND KEEP LOCAL LABOUR M. P. AND TWO A LEADING YOU UKIP ACTIVIST IN THE CITY STEVE WINSTON WHO HIMSELF WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BY THE VOTE
DEFINITELY THEY'VE UNDERESTIMATED THE NORTH THEY JUST FIGURE THAT EVERYBODY UP NORTH I DON'T THINK WE'RE STUPID FLAT CAPS AND WHIPPETS YES THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN'T TELL US ONE SALE THING YOU MEAN WITH THE TARIFFS WILL BE ALL THIS CHINESE STEEL HAVE GOT DUMPED DUMPED ON HIS DOOR
STEVE WINSTON JOHN DRAWING VICTORY WITH TWO OF HIS SUPPORTERS IN A PUB IN PAGE HALL THIS RUN DOWN AREA OF SHEFFIELD HAS BEEN THE TORY US IN RECENT YEARS FOR TENSIONS BETWEEN OBS NEWLY ARRIVED BACK VACUUMS AND THE LOCAL POPULATION
MOST OF THE DRINKERS WERE HAPPY WITH THE REFERENDUM RESULT DESPITE THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND I WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID THAT WE WERE LEAVING AND I WAS SO GLAD WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW THE POUND SIDE I MEAN BUSINESS PUT THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST A SHOCK
IN FIVE WEEKS' TIME IF WE'RE STILL IN THE SAME SITUATION YEAH I WOULD SAY BUT ME PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S JUST A SHOCK WE'VE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE WE'D HAVE SOME TREMORS AND THEN EVENTUALLY
THAT'S MY OPINION I THINK THAT AS WELL I THINK THIS TIME THE ESTABLISHMENT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON THE ROOF OF THE PEOPLE ROUND HERE HAVE SPOKEN I THINK CHEF HE'S GOT THE MOST THE MOST SURPRISING RESULT I HAVE ALL OF THIS
HE ATTRIBUTES THAT TO YEARS OF INTENSIVE WORK BY UKIP AND THE LABOUR PARTY'S FAILURE NIGEL FRANCE ACTUALLY GETTING OUT AND MEETING
TO SPREAD IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT UKIP DOES KAT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY TRANSLATED INTO A EUROSCEPTIC LABOUR PARTY SHE'S GOING
ONE LOCAL LABOUR M.P. RECOGNISES THAT ANGELA SMITH WAS THE FIRST TO CALL ON JEREMY CORBIN TO CONSIDER HIS POSITION I
I THINK THAT JEREMY HAS NOT DISPLAY THE KIND OF DECISIVE BOLD LEADERSHIP OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE NEED TO SAY A SP PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AS A COUNTRY THE COUNTRY'S CLEARLY MOVING INTO A PERIOD OF MAJOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND IT'S NOT JUST THE TORY PARTY IN GOVERNMENT THAT NEEDS TO SHOW REAL LEADERSHIP IT'S THE LABOUR PARTY AS WELL AND I DON'T THINK OF HIM CAN PROVIDE THAT CLEARLY CANVASSING HAD BEEN GRUELLING ALL THAT MATTERED YESTERDAY ON THE DOORSTEP WAS IMMIGRATION
FOR THOSE VOTERS WERE AVERTED THAT SAW THAT I'D SUGGEST TODAY THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE VOTING FOR IT WAS TWO FINGERS UP TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND EFFECTIVELY IT WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO COUNTER THAT
WERE THEY LISTENING TO YOU PROBABLY NOT THEY'RE ENTITLED NOT TO LISTEN TO THEM IN THAT SENSE I'M ON THEIR DOORSTEPS AND THE END OF THE DAY DID YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING I JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU
YES SHE BELIEVES THE PARTY HAS TO DO SOME HARD WORK SOME DEEP THINKING BEFORE IT CAN EVEN BEGIN TO RE ESTABLISH A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH VOTERS
HE SAID WE CAN PROMISE THAT NOTHING WILL CHANGE IN THE EDGY DOESN'T IT IN A SMALL TERRACED HOUSE NOT FAR FROM THE M.P.S HOME I MET A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THE AGE GROUP MOST LIKELY DEVOTE REMAIN WHOSE LIVES MAYBE MOST AFFECTED BY BRICKS IT JANE AN ARTIST TOLD ME THAT ON FRIDAY MORNING SHE FELT LIKE SHE'D WOKEN UP IN A FILM
INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS I DID
FELT SO CERTAIN THAT THIS AREA IN PARTICULAR WOULD VOTE REMAIN AND THE IDEA OF GOING OUT ONTO THE STREETS AND KNOWING THAT HALF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME HAD VOTED LEAVE HAD PUT US IN THIS POSITION IT FEELS VERY STRANGE I'M I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MY CITY AND HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED
ABSOLUTE HORROR I'VE CRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES I THOUGHT I WAS IN SOME KIND OF NIGHTMARE I DON'T I DIDN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT WAS A REAL I KINDA WANTED TO PINCH YOURSELF AND WAKE UP AGAIN AND GO BACK TO THE RESULT THAT I EXPECTED I MOVED UP SHEFFIELD THREE YEARS AGO AND SAW AS AS WELCOMING AMAZING CITY FULL OF STUDENTS AND PEOPLE WHO WERE EDUCATED IN WELCOMING AND FOR THEM TO HAVE THIS DECISION I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
SANCHA BAG THERE AND WE'LL BE HEARING SOME MORE JUBILANT SUPPORTERS OF BRECHT'S IT AND A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME FROM HERE IN SHEFFIELD AT THE TIME NOW IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THEY ARE OF COURSE DOMINATED THERE'S ONLY ONE STORY REALLY BY THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO COVER THE E.U. REFERENDUM RESULT IN FULL THE EXPRESS OFFERS A SPECIAL SOUVENIR EDITION TO PLAYERS OF THE GLORIOUS VICTORY FOR ITS OWN CRUSADE FOR BRICKS
INSIDE NIGEL FARRAJ PRAISES THE PAPER'S OWNER RICHARD DESMOND FOR HIS SUPPORT TOGETHER WE HAVE TRULY MADE HISTORY HE WRITES BUT THE SUN CLAIMS IT WAS A SOUND THAT SWUNG IT ARE LEADING THE WAY IN GIVING THE VOTERS THE CONFIDENCE TO QUIT THE E.U. A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRIME MINISTER DURING HIS RESIGNATION SPEECH COVERS THE FRONT OF THE GUARDIAN WITH THE HEADLINE OVER AND OUT
IT BELIEVES THE RESULT HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO RESHAPE BRITAIN'S FUTURE IN PROFOUND AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WAYS WITH THE ECONOMY THE UNION AND BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD ALL AT STAKE IN THE DAILY MIRROR THE HISTORIAN DAN SNOW SAYS GREAT LEADERS SUCH AS ELIZABETH THE FIRST AND WINSTON CHURCHILL WOULD CALL THE REFERENDUM A GRAVE ERROR HE WANTS THAT WITH SCOTLAND EXPECTED TO LEAVE BRITAIN BRITAIN COULD GO FROM BEING A MAJOR PLAYER TO A LITTLE RUNT STATE
FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NICK CLEGG USES AN ARTICLE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES TO EXPRESS HIS ANGER OR DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE FOR BRINGING A GREAT COUNTRY WITH THIS SORRY CARS HE SAYS THAT AFTER YEARS DENIGRATING THE E.U. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MAKE A POSITIVE CASE FOR REMAINING AND THEY WERE CONDEMNED TO MAKE A NEGATIVE ONE THAT LACKED ANY EMOTIONAL IMPACT
CAUGHT OUT IS THE LEAD HEADLINE FOR THE EYE WEEKEND THE PAPER'S ANDREW GRICE BELIEVES THE PRIME MINISTER UNWISELY HANDED VOTERS OF FREE HIT AND THEY USED IT TO GIVE THE RULING ELITE ARE KICKING THE MALES MAX HASTINGS SAYS MY CAMERAS PAID THE PRICE FOR WHAT HE CALLS YEARS OF BROKEN PROMISES AS WELL AS RUNNING A ROTTEN REMAIN CAMPAIGN THE GUARDIAN SKETCH WRITER JOHN CRACE BIDS FAREWELL TO P.M. DAVE DESCRIBING HIM AS THE GAMBLER WHO LOST HIS TOUCH
HE ALSO REFLECTS ON THE APPARENT SHOCK IN THE LEAF CAMPAIGN HAD ITS VICTORY SAYING MICHAEL GAVE LOOKED LIKE A MAN WHO'D JUST COME DOWN FROM A BAD TRIP TO FIND HE HAD MURDERED ONE OF HIS FRIENDS THAT'S THE TIMES BELIEVES THAT DAVID CAMERON'S LAST MISSION IS TO STOP BORIS JOHNSON GETTING THE KEYS TO NUMBER TEN IT'S THE PRIME MINISTER HAS GIVEN HIMSELF THREE MONTHS TO INFLUENCE WHO SUCCEEDS HIM WITH THERESA MAY EMERGING AS THE FAVOURED STOP BORIS CANDIDATE BUT FOR JOHN RENTAL IN
THE WEEKEND THE LEADER HAS TO BE A LEVER AND BORIS JOHNSON HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD CREDIBLY BE PRIME MINISTER THE F. TEAM BELIEVES THE BRECK'S IT VICTORY HAS ENSURED NIGEL FARAGE IS PLACE IN BRITISH HISTORY ONCE DISCOUNTED AS A DRUNKEN HEKLA IN THE AUDIENCE IT SAYS MY BARRAGE LOOKS MORE LIKE THE SCRIPT WRITER OF THE ENTIRE DRAMA
THE MALE'S COLUMNIST RICHARD LITTLEJOHN BELIEVES THAT IF BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GAVE A SERIOUS ABOUT HEALING THE DIVISIONS CREATED BY THE REFERENDUM THEY SHOULD GIVE MY BARRAGE A KEY ROLE IN NEGOTIATING BRECK'S IT IN THE SAME PAPER PETER OBORNE ARGUES THAT IN THE INTERESTS OF DEMOCRACY IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT LABOUR ALSO BE REPRESENTED
THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE WELL WHEN DAVID CAMERON BECAME CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER HE TOLD HIS PARTY TO STOP BANGING ON ABOUT EUROPE IT HAD DONE FOR PREVIOUS LEADERS AND CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS AND HE WAS TRYING TO CHANGE THAT WELL YESTERDAY IT DID FOR HIM TOO
IN A LONDON STUDIO IS THE FILM MAKER AND LONG TIME WESTMINSTER JOURNALIST MICHAEL COCKERELL WHO HAS WATCHED THE GROWTH OF EURO SCEPTICISM OVER THE YEARS AND OF COURSE MICHAEL IT THAT IT GOES BACK A VERY LONG WAY
IT CERTAINLY DOES I MEAN I MADE FILMS ABOUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND MISSUS THATCHER HAD JUST BECOME TORY LEADER AND YOU COULD SUM UP HER VIEWS ABOUT EUROPE IN THREE WORDS THEN YES
YES YES AND SHE SAID TO ME IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ON THURSDAY WILL VOTE IN A ONCE IN A LIFETIME REFERENDUM AND SETTLE THIS ISSUE OF BRITAIN'S PLACE IN EUROPE ONCE AND FOR ALL AND THEY MUST VOTE
BUT IT ALL CHANGED ONCE HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER SHE BECAME INCREASINGLY DISILLUSIONED
WITH THE EUROPEAN PROJECT SHE THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS ONCE A TRADING BLOCK WAS NOW TURNING INTO A POLITICAL INSTITUTION AND SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PUT A STOP TO MERTON TEA MADE
HIS FAMOUS SPEECH IN BRUGES WHICH ACTUALLY STOKED THE FIRES OF EURO SCEPTICISM AMONG HER OWN CONSERVATIVE M.P.S
AND CORSET ALIENATED A NUMBER OF HER OTHER CABINET COLLEAGUES AND MICHAEL HESELTINE WHO WAS IN THE WILDERNESS AT THAT TIME AND HELPED
BRING HER DOWN JUST BEFORE IT BROUGHT HER DOWN WHAT JUST AFTER SHE'D LOST THE LEADERSHIP SHE MADE THIS FAMOUS REMARK IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN NINETEEN NINETY IT WAS HER LAST SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
THE CHAIRMAN ON YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION MISTER DUNMORE SAID A PRESS CONFERENCE THE OTHER DAY THAT HE WANTED THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC BODY OF THE COMMUNITY HE WANTED THE COMMISSION TO BE THE EXECUTIVE AND HE WANTED THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS TO BE THE SENATE NO
MICHAEL EUROPE OF COURSE THE FACTORING IN MISSUS THATCHER'S DOWNFALL BUT HE ALSO SAID SEE IT SOWED THE SEEDS OF TROUBLE FOR JOHN MAJOR IT DID INDEED I MEAN JOHN MAJOR TOOK OVER AFTER THAT AND HE CAME UP
AGAINST AN INCREASINGLY STRONG EUROSCEPTIC FEELING AMONG HIS OWN
M.P.S INDEED AT ONE STAGE IN AN INTERVIEW WITH I.T.N. WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS OFF CAMERA HE WAS TALKING ABOUT TWO OF HIS OWN CABINET MINISTERS AND WAS ASKED TO HER
WHY DON'T YOU SACK THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING SO EUROSCEPTIC WERE BEING SO DIFFICULT IN CABINET WITH HIM HE SAID
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO MORE OF THE BASTARDS UP THERE SO THAT'S NICE THE WAY HMM IF IT MAKES HER PRIME MINISTER SPEAK ABOUT HIS COLLEAGUES PUT IT IT WENT ON THROUGH THE WHOLE MAASTRICHT REBELLIONS AND IT WENT SO FAR THE JOHN MAJOR ACTUALLY
STOOD DOWN AS CONSERVATIVE LEADER AND STOOD AGAIN TO TO TRY AND BRING THE THE THE BASTARDS OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND INDEED JOHN HUMPHRYS
HE ONCE SAID TO JOHN MAJOR AT THAT TIME JOHN TO PROBABLY TELL A STORY BUT I REMEMBER HIM SO I THINK TWO TO JOHN RIGHT WHY HAVE YOU DECIDED TO STAND AGAINST YOURSELF AND THEY JUST HAD I HAVE MADE IT A RULE
IN LIVESTOCK WHEN MY BACK'S TO THE WALL I TURN ROUND AND FIRE IT AND HE LOST THE HUGELY DIVIDED PARTY
CONTRIBUTED VERY MUCH TO HIS NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN DOWNFALL IN THE GENERAL ELECTION TONY BLAIR CAME IN AS AN AVOWEDLY PRO EUROPEAN EUROPE
PRIME MINISTER AND AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOWN
PARTY CALLED UKIP AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE CLIPS FROM THAT NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ELECTION
A LITTLE KNOWN U.K. INDEPENDENCE PARTY ON U.K. I.P.O. ONLY THREE YEARS OLD THEY AVERAGED JUST OVER THREE PERCENT OF THE VOTING IN EUROPEAN ELECTIONS BUT THEY'RE PLANNING TO FIGHT EVERY SEA TOOK A GENERAL ELECTION WHAT STARTED AS A MURMUR
IN THE PUBS AND CLUBS AND WHEREVER PEOPLE CONGREGATE IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOW BEGINNING TO REACH A CRESCENDO RAUL AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE'S DEAD
GOODNESS LOOK WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW MICHAEL COCKERELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT IS NOW FIVE TO NINE THE UNITED KINGDOM IS A DIVIDED COUNTRY THAT'S LITERALLY TRUE WE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAST OUR VOTES ON THURSDAY BUT IS IT TRUE IN A MORE PROFOUND PERHAPS MORE WORRYING SENSE ONE CASUALTY OF THE REFERENDUM IS THE PARTY SYSTEM HAD DELIVERED A CRUSHING BLOW TO THE NOTION OF LOYALTY TO A SPECIFIC PARTY IN THE EFFECT OF THAT MAY BE THAT THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO BE SIMPLY MORE DIFFICULT TO GOVERN IN THE COMING YEARS WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AND OTHER EFFECTS
TWO WITH BRIAR BROMHAM ADDICTS WHO IS THE NEW DIRECTORS HE JUST GOT THE JOB TAKES OVER VERY SOON OF THE INSTITUTE FOR GOVERNMENT AND PROFESSOR MATTHEW FLINDERS DIRECTOR OF THESE HAVE BEEN A QUICK CENTRE THE UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD BROM AND MORE DIFFICULT
YES I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN THIS VOTE IS A COUNTRY SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY AS AS YOU'RE SAYING WITH THOSE CAMPS STRANGERS TO EACH OTHER AND THOSE FAULT LINES RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES TO PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE OLD POLITICAL PARTIES THE CONSERVATIVES LABOUR DON'T MAP ONTO THAT WHAT THEY'RE MOST CARING ABOUT CHUNK OF CONSERVATIVE VOTERS WHO TURNED AGAINST IT THEIR LEADERSHIP A WHOLE CHUNK OF
LABOUR VOTERS PARTICULARLY WALES AND THE NORTH EAST WHO TURNED AGAINST AGAINST THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THOSE FAULT LINES RUN VERY DEEP IT SEEMS TO ME AND IT MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR THE PARTIES TO COUNT ON SUMMONING UP THEIR SUPPORT IN THE OLD WAY DO YOU YEAH I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE CRITICAL PART IS ALMOST LIKE DINOSAURS RUMBLING ACROSS THE SURVIVE BUT NOT REALLY SURE WHERE THEY'RE GOING OR WHY AND IN FACT WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A POST TRIBAL SOCIETY BUT STILL VERY TRIBAL PARTIES
SO DO WE HAVE THEN THE END OF I DON'T KNOW YOU THE BROAD CHURCH IF YOU LIKE THAT ONCE OR MAYBE THIS JUST IMAGINING WISHFUL THINKING ENCOMPASSED ALL OF US WITH A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PEOPLE
FEELING THAT THEY'VE BEEN LEFT OUT OF IT I THINK IT DOES I THINK WHAT IT ACTUALLY NEEDS IS THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE MORE DYNAMIC TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW SOCIETY'S CHANGING AND WHAT IT NEEDS IS AS IF THE POLITICAL PARTIES ARE STILL TRAPPED IN THE NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH CENTURY AND THE DISCONNECTION THE FRUSTRATION OF THE PUBLIC HAVE NOT FEELING BUT THERE ARE TOOLS TO WHICH THEY CAN REALLY BE REPRESENTED I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S COME OUT IN THIS REFERENDUM
AND YET THE PUBLIC WANTED THIS REFERENDUM AT LEAST WE CAN MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION FROM VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED IN IT AND THEY GOT THE RESULT THEY OBVIOUSLY YOU ALWAYS DO IN A REFERENDUM THEY GOT THE RESULT MOST OF THEM WANTED SO WHY SHOULDN'T THEY BE TERRIBLY HAPPY ABOUT IT
I THINK WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE HAPPY WITH IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IS NOW OFFERED AND IT IS AS EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING GOING TO TAKE US QUITE A LONG TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY CAN BE OFFERED IN THE WAY OF TRADE DEALS AND SO ON AND RELATIONS WITH THE EEL AND THE REST OF THE WORLD SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO SETTLE DOWN BUT
THIS REALLY ARTICULATED A SORT OF ABOVE OVER ANYTHING ELSE
AN UNEASE ABOUT IMMIGRATION OR FURY ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN SOME QUARTERS AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO REALLY VERY THOSE WHO VOTED IN THAT WAY ARE GOING TO WANT A VERY RAPID RESPONSE ON THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT THE NEXT GOVERNMENT IT SEEMS TO ME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND IT WILL BE THROWN OUT
THE NEW LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT HE OR SHE CAN AND DO THAT AND HOW DO THEY
PERHAPS THIS IS AN ODD QUESTION BUT HOW DO THEY EXPRESS THEIR ANGER IF THEY DON'T GET THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO SO IN A SENSE BY VOTING AGAINST THE OPPOSITION LAD AND THE CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY CAN'T
VOTE AGAINST THE WHAT IF THEY VOTE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WHAT DO THEY DO THEY TURN TO THE OPPOSITION THEY DON'T WANT BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE THAT CLEAR AS WELL AS A RESULT OF THIS REFERENCE AYE IT IS IMMENSELY DIFFICULT PICTURE ISN'T IT WELL IN MANY WAYS THE POLITICIANS HAVE FALLEN INTO THEIR OWN TRAP IT WAS ACTUALLY AN ANTI POLITICAL ANTI ESTABLISHMENT REFERENDUM AND THAT'S THE REAL PARADOX HERE THAT ACTUALLY WHAT POLITICIANS HAVE DONE IS THEY'VE HOLLOWED OUT TRUST IN THE CAPACITY OF POLITICS TO DELIVER
THE BIG CONCERN HERE ACTUALLY THE BIG FAULTLINE THERE DIVIDE ISN'T TERRITORIAL IT'S MORE BASIC THAN THAT IT'S BETWEEN THE GOVERNORS AND THE GOVAN BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE NOW HAD IS THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS PUT SO HIGH THAT FAILURE TO SOME EXTENT IT'S COULD BE CONNECT BECOME INEVITABLE I DON'T THINK THE PUBLIC WERE WELL SERVED BY THE DEBATE IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION IT WAS IT WAS A DISHONEST CAMPAIGN ON BOTH SIDES THAT THE PUBLIC WERE IN MANY WAYS DUPED
NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE THINKING WELL O.K. WE'VE GOT A DELIVERY FOR WHAT WE VOTED FOR I MEAN IT'S VERY INTERESTING IF YOU TALK TO PRIME MINISTERS AND PRESIDENTS AROUND THE WORLD WHEN THEY'VE WON A BIG ELECTION ON THE FACE OF IT THEY'RE VERY HAPPY THEY'RE PLEASED DEEP DOWN THERE ARE MOTION IS FEAR WHAT HAVE I DONE HOW AM I GOING TO DELIVER THEY'VE GONE FOR THE PEST PROBLEM THE CONFIT BEING THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT
YES IT IS A VOTE AGAINST EXPERTS IF YOU LIKE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE EXPERTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN WHEELED ON TO ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND YET PEOPLE SAID IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY THAT IT'S THIS IS REMAIN MIGHT BE BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY FOR THE COUNTRY OVERALL BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL BETTER FOR ME AND SO I'M GOING TO VOTE VOTE FOR THAT AND IT IS PEOPLE SAYING LOOK I DON'T I FED UP WITH MY REPRESENTATIVES IF YOU LIKE DOING THESE THINGS ON MY BEHALF BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL AS IF THE BENEFITS ARE COMING DOWN
WELL THE ONLY ALTERNATIVES ANARCHY OR HORRIBLE CONSTANT REFERENDUM OR CONCERT REFERENDUM SEVEN FORBID I'M SURE NEITHER OF YOU IS WELL ARE YOU COOK ONE ON THAT I THINK THERE'S A GREAT BIG OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR ANY PARTY ANY POLITICIAN WHAT WE NEED AT THE MOMENT WHAT SOCIETY NEEDS IS A NARRATIVE THAT BINDS US BACK TOGETHER A POSITIVE HOPEFUL CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE PUBLIC THAT CAN REBUILD SOME OF THESE FRACTURES THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE THE POLITICIANS TO DO IT RIGHT WHAT WILLIE THAT WHEN THE PAIN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH PROFESSOR MATTHEW BROMHAM ADDICTS HAVE BEEN SUPER GOVERNMENT
IT IS JUST AFTER NINE O'CLOCK AND YOU'RE LISTENING TO A SPECIALLY EXTENDED TODAY PROGRAMME THIS MORNING WE'RE ON AIR FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR UNTIL HALF PAST NINE SO LET'S GET A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM SUSAN
THE POTENTIAL COST TO U.K. FINANCES OF THE DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN A SERIES OF WARNINGS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN UP YOUR OWN DICE OF SAID SOME FINANCE COMPANIES MIGHT CHOOSE TO MOVE TO RIVAL CITIES WITHIN THE E.U. BECAUSE BRITAIN WILL ONLY ENJOY LIMITED ACCESS TO INTERNAL MARKETS AND THE LEADING CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY MOODY'S HAS DOWNGRADED THE U.K.'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK TO NEGATIVE COLIN ELLIS FROM THE AGENCY TOLD US WHY THEY TAKEN THAT DECISION
THIS CLEARLY LIKELY TO BE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THAT IMPACT WILL BE IT COULD END UP BEING QUITE SLIGHT IF THE U.K. AND THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COME TO A FAVOURABLE AGREEMENT IT COULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED IF NEGOTIATIONS ARE MORE PROTRACTED OR WE COME TO A LESS FAVOURABLE AND STANDING

LABOUR'S LOST CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS WITH VERY VERY GOOD AT CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE ON THE STREETS ACTUALLY LISTENING AND COMMUNICATING
LABOUR HAVE LOST THAT THE DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE LABOUR VOTERS IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL IT IT'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY REALLY EVERYBODY KNOWS IT THE ONLY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE LABOUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ARROGANCE OR THEY'VE JUST LOST CONTACT THIS THIS IS THIS IS A VICTORY FOR GREAT BRITAIN
IT'S A VICTORY FOR FOR PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR US A DECENT PEOPLE AND I THINK WE ARE A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD WE ARE SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS AT THE LABOUR PARTY SPLIT INTO THREE YOU'VE GOT THAT TORY PARTS OF THE LABOUR PARTY WHICH IS BLAIR MANDELSON YOU'VE GOT THE MIDDLE GROUND NOW WHICH IS HILARY BENN THEN YOU'VE GOT TO KORBEN WHO OTHER NATIVITY LEFT AND THEY MISSED A MASSIVE TREE
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN UNDER LEAF SIDE AND THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AGAINST THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY BUT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT YOU COULD HAVE CHARGED THEM WITH OPPORTUNISM IF FOLK FOR MANY THEM NOT LEAVE THEM FOR MANY AN AMBULANCE CERTAINLY MEN OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY THE LABOUR PARTY I'VE WALKED AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THERE PEOPLE AREN'T WALKING AWAY FROM THE LABOUR PARTY THERE WILL LABOUR PARTY HAVE WALKED AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT'S THE PROM
WELL LORD BLUNKETT FOREMOST M.P. FOR SHEFFIELD OF COURSE AND A FORMER LABOUR HOME SECRETARY AND JOINS US NOW LORD BLANCA GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING IT'S DAVID SARAH IF YOU WISH IN YOU WE HEARD THEIR VOICES THERE DO THEY HAVE A POINT
YES OF COURSE THEY HAVE A POINT BECAUSE PART OF THE AREA YOU WERE IN I KNOW VERY WELL AND I KNOW WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR LEAVE IN THOSE AREAS FRUSTRATION ALIENATION IF YOU'VE NOT GOT A LOT TO LOSE WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE THE THE FEAR OF CHANGE THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE IN AREAS LIKE THE WORK THE ONE YOU WERE IN LAST NIGHT ACTUALLY WERE THE VICTIMS BOTH
RAPID CHANGE IN GLOBALISATION AND OF THE UNFETTERED AND WORST OF WHAT PLEA THAT THE IMMIGRATION AND THE TRANS NATIONAL IMPACT OF THE MARKETS WERE DOING TO THEM IS BUT THE CHARGES THAT LABOUR DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT WELL I DON'T THINK WE DO IT YET AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE AND THE WORLD I JUST COME BACK FROM NORTH AMERICA AND THE SAME SORT OF ISSUES THE SAME BATTLES
ARE GOING ON IN NORTH AMERICA THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS BRINGING OUT THE SAME KIND OF FEELINGS OF ANTI ESTABLISHMENT ANTI GLOBALISATION FEELINGS OF ISO OF DESIRE FOR ISOLATION FROM
A WORLD WITHOUT HAMSTERS AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP AND BORIS JOHNSON DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO HOW YOU DEAL WITH GLOBALISATION NOT BY WITHDRAWING FROM IT BUT BY ENGAGING DIRECTLY WITH IT AND CREATING ALLIANCES ACROSS THE WORLD NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ANY MORE SO WE'VE GOT TO WORK OUT HOW WE DO THAT WITH THOSE OF LIKE MIND ACROSS THE GLOBE
DO YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOW AND THE HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS OF SOME OF THE MAJORITY YOU VOTED LEAVE CAN THEY BE
WELL THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THE CONSERVATIVE BUT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE FUTURE OF THE TORY PARTY ARE REGRETTABLY THAT'S HOW IT CAME ACROSS IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS IT DIDN'T COME ACROSS AS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF BRITAIN AND OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD AND HOW WE READJUST TO ENORMOUS CHANGE AND TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE FACE WITH POWER HAVING
SEEPED AWAY FROM NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS NEVER MIND THE DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE AND WE'VE ENDED UP WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FAR RIGHT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE U.K. WITH THE U.K. DISINTEGRATING WITH RESENTMENT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN FAVOUR OF LEAVE WON'T BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE KIND OF THINGS
PROMISE ABOUT FEAR GREATLY FOR DEMOCRATIC POLITICS HERE AS I DO IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD YOU'RE PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE CONSERVATIVES BUT THEY CALLED THE DAMNED ELECTION IT WAS ALL ABOUT LABOUR COULD HAVE MADE IT THEIR ARGUMENT THEY COULD HAVE ARGUED PASSIONATELY FOR REMAINING IN THE Y. YOU
AND ARGUABLY IF THEY'D MADE A GOOD ENOUGH CASE THEY COULD'VE PERSUADE PEOPLE WELL I THINK ALAN JOHNSON AND THOSE WORKING WITH HIM AND IT INCLUDED AN EFFORT BY SOME OF OURS I MANAGED TO GET ON TO YOUR PROGRAMME A MONTH AGO TO SAY SOME OF THESE THINGS
WE COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER COLLECTIVE CASE FOR WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO LINK UP WITH LIKE MINDED PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO COUNTERWEIGHT THE REAL POWER SOURCES THAT EXIST ACROSS TO WHERE WE'VE ENDED UP WITH THE MARKETS CREATING THE TOTAL MELTDOWN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT POLITICIANS BEING BLAMED FOR THE CONSEQUENCE
AUSTERITY REAL AUSTERITY POLITICIANS NOW BEING IN THE DRIVING SEAT IN THE U.K. RELIANT ON THE MARKETS WHICH THEY WHICH THEY THOSE WHO VOTED TO LEAVE PRESUMABLY
WE'RE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN STRETCH SO CALLED SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF PARLIAMENT PART PARLIAMENT THE OTHER TWO YEARS WE WE'RE TRYING TO OFFER PEOPLE
A DIFFICULT COMPLEX SOLUTION IN A WORLD WHERE THEY WANT SIMPLE SOLUTIONS THAT LAURA TITIAN'S ARE COURT PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO YOU AND THINK YOU'RE BLAMING EVERYTHING BUT SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IS AN ISSUE WHICH IS IMMIGRATION AND NOT LEAST YOUR COLLEAGUE JACK STRAW SAID IT WAS A FAILURE TO PUT TRANSITIONAL CONTROLS IN PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND FOR TO LIMIT THE NUMBERS COMING FROM EASTERN EUROPE HE DESCRIBED THAT AS A SPECTACULAR MISTAKE DO YOU EXCEPT THAT IN PART
THAT LED TO WHERE WE ARE NOW LEAVING THE EUROPEAN WORLD LIQUEUR TAKING TWO PARTS WORK WAS IMMIGRATION AT A CRITICAL ISSUE DID WE NEED TO HAVE SET A LOT MORE AND UNDERSTOOD A LOT MORE YES OF COURSE
WHO HAVE THE TRANSITIONAL CONTROLS THE ISSUE OF COURSE THEY WEREN'T THAT HAVE RUN OUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND ITCHIN NOW IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NET MIGRATION NOT NOT NOT IN THERE IN THE IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH
TWO THOUSAND FOR BUT A BIZARRE THAT IS CRUCIAL AND SARAH THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IF THE LEAVES CAMPAIGN WHO HAVE ONE ARE GOING TO REDUCE IMMIGRATION THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SO WITHOUT IMMIGRATION CONTROLS ON FRENCH SOIL THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SO IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR
FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE WHO WERE CS SO CALLED NEW ENTRANTS AND REGISTERED TO WORK WERE ACTUALLY ALREADY IN THE COUNTRY IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ILLEGAL MIGRATION RATHER THAN UPFRONT OPEN LEGAL MIGRATION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW PRIME MINISTER WE MAY VERY WELL HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION THE LABOUR M.P. ANGELA SMITH HERE SAYS THAT JEREMY CORBETT IS NOT FIT TO BE LEADER IS SHE RIGHT WELL JEREMY ISN'T THE PROBLEM HIS PROJECT AND THOSE AROUND HIM OTHER PROBLEM
BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS SO YOU DON'T YOU WOULD URGE M.P.S NOT TO GET RID OF HIM WELL I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM I'M NOT IN FAVOUR OF JEREMY BEING THE LONG TERM LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY BUT THROWING EGGS AT HIM AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING UNTIL THE LABOUR PARTY ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT ITS NEW LEADER STANDS FOR AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO RELATE BOTH TO THE INSTINCTS OF THE
ELECTRIC AND THE REALITY OF GLOBALISATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYWHERE AND THAT IS THE MOST ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR ALL SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTIES ACROSS THE WORLD AND I DON'T HAVE A SIMPLE ANSWER DAVID BLUNKETT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
QUARTER PAST NINE BORIS JOHNSON IS THE HOT FAVOURITE TO WIN THE TORY PARTY LEADERSHIP AND THEREFORE BECOMING AN EX PRIME MINISTER OBVIOUSLY HE HASN'T ACTUALLY APPLIED FOR THE JOB IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT BUT NO ONE HAS ANY DOUBT THAT HE WILL SO WHAT KIND OF LEADER MIGHTY MAKE I'M JOINED BY TWO JOURNALISTS WITH TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF HIM SONY OPEN THAT WAS WRITTEN BOOK JUST BORIS A TALE OF BLUNT BLONDE AMBITION AND ANDREW JIMSON HAS WRITTEN BORIS OF THE RISE OF BORIS JOHNSON SONY ARE FAIR TO SAY THAT
YOU'RE NOT A HUGE FAN AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT BORIS JOHNSON TO ADMIRE AND TO MARVEL AT HIS HIS INCREDIBLE CAMPAIGNING FLARE OF COURSE HOWEVER I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS PERSONALITY HIS TRUSTWORTHINESS WAS STATISTICS FOR EXAMPLE YOU TROLLS LIKE THOSE I THINK HE TELLS UNTRUTHS YES WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT TO HIM AND HE'S BEEN CAUGHT OUT QUITE A FEW TIMES IN HIS CAREER AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE AND
WELL PERSONALLY I QUITE LIKE TENTH PRIME MINISTER THAT DOESN'T GET CAUGHT OUT LYING VERY OFTEN SO I WOULD HAVE GREAT RESERVATIONS ABOUT THAT CERTAINLY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIS PAST
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HIS COMPETENCE TO TO RUN A VERY LARGE ORGANISATION WHEN HE FIRST WENT INTO CITY HALL IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS WE HAD A RASH OF RESIGNATIONS SACKINGS A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION HIS CHIEF OF STAFF HAD TO TAKE HIM OUT TO DINNER BUT AGED THEM INTO A DARK CORNER OF A LONDON RESTAURANT AND TOLD HIM TO GET A GRIP AND START BEHAVING LIKE A MARE THINGS STAY CALM DOWN AND CITY HALLS WE KNOW BUT THAT WAS LARGELY DOWN TO THE COMPETENCE OF A VERY VERY GOOD
DEPUTY MAYOR HE WAS QUITE OFTEN ABSENT HE WAS BUSY WRITING BOOKS WRITING COLUMNS HE DIDN'T REALLY GET TO GRIPS WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN LONDON SUCH AS HOUSING AND AN AIR POLLUTION AND WE'RE PAYING THE PRICE OF THAT NOW HE ALSO DOESN'T REALLY LIKE WORKING IN A TEAM HE'S A LONER HE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO LIKES PEOPLE AROUND HIM OF THE SAME SORT OF STASIS AS HE IS HE'S GREAT WITH SUBORDINATE HIS NOT SO GOOD WITH PEOPLE ANYONE THAT HE THINKS MIGHT BE A THREAT ANDREW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
WELL I THINK SONIA IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT BORIS HASN'T ALWAYS HAD A A STRICT REGARD FOR TRUTH BUT I THINK THIS IS A SORT OF RIDICULOUS A NAIVE IDEA OF POLITICS I THINK
BORIS IS THEY'LL TELL LIES THEY ALL TELL LIES WHAT'S ON HIS HEAD WITH YOU SHOULD BE FOUND OUT BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO ABROAD TO LIE FOR THE GOOD OF YOUR OWN COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE YOU DON'T GO TO BRUSSELS AND SAY AND THEY SAY WHAT YOU THINK I DON'T LIKE YOUR OWN PEE DON'T GO TO BRUSSELS AND SAY YOUNG CONSISTS YOU WHAT'S YOUR NEGOTIATING AND YOU SAY WELL IT'S X. Y. AND Z. YOU BLOODY WELL DON'T TELL HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE AND YOU MAYBE YOU MAYBE DISSEMBLE THE WHAT YOUR ACTUAL THERE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IN THAT NEGOTIATION IS IT'S JUST NOT HOW
HOW POLITICS AT A HIGH LEVEL OR EVEN WAS A LOW LEVEL AT THE HIGH LEVEL ISN'T TELLING THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK'S N.H.S. AND THEN IMMEDIATELY OFFERED SAY THAT WILL ACTUALLY NO THAT'S NOT THE CASE WE DID HAVE IT ON OUR BACK A BUS BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY TOO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUT OF DATE PEDANTRY ALL RIGHT BUT LEADING LOOK I DON'T THINK ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE QUALITIES BORIS THAT'S HIS RESILIENCE WHICH YOU CERTAINLY NEED
AT A HIGH LEVEL TEN YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS COMPLETELY DOWN ON HIS LUCK IT HAD TERRIBLE EMBARRASSMENTS YOU'VE BEEN SMASHED BY THAN A COMBINATION OF THE NEWS OF THE WORLD AND HIS OWN PARTY LEADER HE SEEMED TO BE OUT OF IT HE ENDS THE INTERVIEW BY SINGING A SONG BY CHUMBAWAMBA I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO KEEP ME DOWN IS THAT A QUALITY LEADERSHIP IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE YOU CAN NEVER BE OUT OF EACH WERE KNOCKED DOWN BLOW BUT ISN'T THE FACT THAT HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY HIS OWN BEHAVE INTO WELL BUT THEN HE HE GOT BACK UP
ON HIS FEET IT'S LIKE BEING KNOCKED DOWN IN A BOXING MATCH ISN'T IT IT IS BUT IT'S NOT QUITE IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO A BOXING MATCH FOR A FAIR FIGHT IF YOU DO SOMETHING REPREHENSIBLE AND YOU'RE THEN ATTACKED FOR IT CAN YOU RISE AGAIN YOU STILL DONE SOMETHING REPRESENTS WHO HAS NEVER DONE SOMETHING REPRESENTS WILL BE TO HAVE PLASTER SAINTS GOVERNING THIS COUNTRY IT'S UTTERLY UNREALISTIC IDEA THAT WE WOULD BE GOVERNED BY FIFTH RATE MEDI OPERATIVES IF WE INSISTED ON PEOPLE WHO HAD TO COMPLETELY IMMACULATE LIFE IN EVERY RESPECT IT WAS CHURCHILL INVARIABLY SOBER
INVARIABLY RIGHT ABOUT GALLIPOLI I DON'T I DON'T MEAN THE BORIS IS ANYTHING LIKE AS GREAT A FIGURE OF CHURCHILL BUT ALL GREAT MEN OR CONSIDERABLE FIGURES HAVE HAVE GRIEVOUS FAULT AND THEY HAVE FLAWS BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE FLAWS AND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR FLOORS I THINK SORT OF HOLDING YOUR CARDS CLOSE TO YOUR CHEST AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATION IS OBVIOUSLY SENSIBLE AND RIGHT LYING TO THE PEOPLE ON SOMETHING AS CRITICAL ARE SAYING THAT WILL HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK
TO SPEND ON THE N.H.S. AND THEN REVERSE THAT FIVE MINUTES AFTER YOU'VE WON IS SOME IS A DESCENDANTS OF THE TOTALLY IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE LIKE THAT LIKE TO THEY WANT TO BE TOLD I DON'T WANT THE LIGHTER WELL MAYBE YOU DON'T MAYBE YOU'RE VERY HEIM YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY HIGH MINDED PERSON BUT MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANT TO BE TOLD THAT THE SOME ANSWER TO IMMIGRATE YOU SINK THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT POLITICIANS' PRIVATE LIFE AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME I THINK IF POLITICIAN HAS GONE OUT AND SAID MONOGAMY IS THE IS THE IDEAL AND WE MUST ALL ATTAINED TO IT AND ADULTERERS MUST BE STONED
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE BECOMES OF OF CRATES AND TELLING IMPORTANCE BUT IF YOU ARE A MERRY ENGLAND CONSERVATIVE WHO BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE AND SHOULD BE FREE TO ENJOY THEMSELVES THEN I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK GOOD LUCK TO YOU
I THINK THAT BEING FREE TO ENJOY THE CELLS AS ONE THING BUT THE COURT OF APPEAL WAS SO SHOCKED BY HIS BEHAVIOUR WHEN HIT MEN TRY TO GUIDE THE IDEA THAT HE HAD THE ACTUAL FACT HE HAD A LOVE CHILD THAT THEY SAID THAT THEY QUESTIONED HIS FITNESS FOR FOR OFFICE SO I THINK THEY DON'T SEE IT AS A MERRY ENGLAND TYPE A JOLLY JAPE IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE A SERIOUS WAY TO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE VERY QUICK THOUGHT AND I THINK HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY THIS IS UNOBSERVED
CHARACTERISTIC OR AN UNREMARKED IF HE'S ACTUALLY CHARITABLE TO OBSCURE I DON'T MEAN HE'S ENTITLED TO ME BUT I SEEN HIM BE CHARITABLE TO VERY OBSCURE PEOPLE WHO'VE SUFFERED TERRIBLE THINGS THERE WE MUST END IT THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH SUNNY OPEN ANDROGENS AND THINK ABOUT
IT'S TWENTY MINUTES PAST NINE WHILE WE ARE ALL REELING FROM THE UNBELIEVABLY FAST PACE OF CHANGE OVER THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS LEZZA GET ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE NOW FROM OUR POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG AND A EUROPE EDITOR CATCH ADDER LAURA FIRST OF ALL HUGE PRESSURE ON SO MANY PEOPLE BUT NOT LEAST JEREMY CORBIN AND
PLENTY CALLING FOR HIM TO GO HE'S GOING TO MAKE A SPEECH LATER TODAY WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT HE IS HOW HE'S GOING TO FIGHT BACK
I THINK IT'S VERY VERY ROCKY FOR THE LABOUR LEADERSHIP NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO YOUR TUE THINGS TODAY ONE PLEDGE THAT SOMEHOW IN A RENEGOTIATION LABOUR ONES IT'S VERY BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS' RIGHTS ARE NOT SACRIFICED IN THE DEALS THAT ARE DONE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND BRUSSELS IN TERMS OF HOW WE LOOK AT THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT SECONDLY HE WILL DO SOMETHING THAT SAID YOU'VE BEEN SNEAKING INTO HIS RHETORIC A BIT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF HIS
NATURAL LABOUR SUPPORTERS DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IMMIGRATION THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO SAY UNTIL ABOUT A MONTH AGO YOU REALLY NEVER EVEN HEARD ESCAPE FROM JEREMY CORBIN'S LIPS BECAUSE HIS VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION OR YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO PROTECT
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT YOU REALLY THAT WE SHOULDN'T LIMIT IMMIGRATION FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
SENIOR LABOUR FIGURES IN RECENT DAYS TOM WATSON EVEN JOHN MCDONNELL AND NOW JEREMY CORBIN ARE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK AT FREEMAN MOVEMENT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF PROTECTING WORKERS' RIGHTS BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT MANY LABOUR VOTERS HE DECIDED
TO CHOOSE TO LEAVE THE E.U. WHERE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT SO I'M NOT SURE IF THIS SPEECH TODAY IS REALLY GOING TO DO VERY MUCH TO CONFRONT THE VERY DEEP UNEASE AND FACES INSIDE THE PARTY CAN YOU SURVIVE
WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH OF IT SARAH IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH M. PEAS TO DEFEAT HIM IN A SECRET BALLOT ON TUESDAY NIGHT BUT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY ACTUALLY GET HIM OUT
BECAUSE THE PROCESS OF THE LABOUR PARTY AFTER THAT POINT HE'S NO CONFIDENCE BUT AS IT'S BEING PUT FORWARD IS NOT A FORMAL LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE IS BASICALLY AN ADVISORY AFTER THAT IT'S UP TO HIM TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO STAY OR GO RIGHT NOW HE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY INTENT ON STAYING EVEN ESSES M. PEAS SORT OF BEAT HIM UP AROUND THE HEAD
HE STILL HAS THE MEMBERSHIP ON HIS SIDE AND CRUCIALLY YESTERDAY SEVERAL OF THE BIG UNIONS PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT NOW IS BASICALLY NOT THE TIME FOR LABOUR M.P.S START PLAYING LIKE THIS I'VE SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IT THERE'S A SORT OF TACTIC HERE IF THEY THEY HAVE TO START TRYING IT MIGHT TAKE SEVERAL GOES BUT THEY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BUT A SHADOW CABINET IS NOT NECESSARILY ALL IN THE SAME PLACE
CATCH ADLER HOW WHAT IS THE LATEST SOUNDS FROM EUROPE AS TO THE MOOD THEY'RE ABOUT NEGOTIATING A FAVOURABLE DEAL FOR THE UK
I THOUGHT YOU COULD TO BUT THE SANDS OF EUROPE FULL STOP WHICH I WOULD SAY IS A MIXED AT THE MOMENT OF PANIC FOLLOWING THE VOTE TO LEAVE THE E.U. FROM THE U.K. AND ALSO DETERMINATION THAT EUROPE MUST CONTINUE AND THAT REALLY FEEDS IN TO WHERE THEY GO NOW WITH THE U.K. OF COURSE THE BALL RIGHT NOW WAS FIRMLY IN BRITAIN'S COURT NO NEGOTIATIONS CAN START NO UNTANGLING COUPLING OF THE E. U. U. K. RELATIONSHIP CAN START UNTIL DAVID CAMERON
OR THE PERSON WHO TAKES OVER FROM HIM OFFICIALLY NOTIFIES BRUSSELS AND ALL THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN LEADERS OF THE E.U. THAT THE U.K. IS OFF BECAUSE THE VOTE THE REFERENDUM ON THURSDAY IS SEEN AS AN ADVISORY TO IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED IN BRUSSELS YET AS A MOMENT TO START BREAKING OFF RELATIONS
NOW YOU DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF VOICES SAYING THAT THE U.K. NEEDS TO BE MADE AN EXAMPLE OF BECAUSE THE REFERENDUM RESULT IN THE U.K. SENDS A MESSAGE THAT THE E.U. IS CRUMBLING SO NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT DAMAGE CONTROL AT THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION JUNK ALL JUNKER SENT LAST NIGHT THIS WON'T BE AN AMICABLE DIVORCE AND CERTAINLY FRANCE IS VERY KEEN TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF BRITAIN AND DON'T FORGET ITS POSITION BECOMES THAT MUCH MORE POWERFUL INSIDE THE E.U. NOW THE U.K. PLANS TO LEAVE
BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SPLITS AS TO HOW TO APPROACH THE U.K. ONCE THE PROCESS ACTUALLY START CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE DON'T WANT TO ALIENATE THE U.K. THEY RELY ON BRITAIN TO MAINTAIN TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA POLAND OF COURSE HOPES THAT BRITAIN WENT SUDDENLY FORCE IT'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COUNTRY
AND GERMANY'S ANGELA MERKEL WAS SHE BECOMES EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW IN EUROPE OF COURSE SHE'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN ARE DEDICATED EUROPEAN YES SHE LIKE OTHERS WANTS TO SHOW THAT OUT HURTS SHE WANTS TO PUT OTHERS OFF LEAVING BUT SHE'S A PRAGMATIST WHEN IT COME TO GERMAN TRADE FIGURES AND SHE'LL WORK WITH THE U.K. EVENTUALLY CATCH ADLAI LAURA KINSBERG THANK YOU
TWENTY FIVE PAST NINE HISTORY WAS MADE ON THURSDAY ON THAT EVERYONE'S AGREED BUT THE PROBLEM WITH HISTORIC EVENTS AS IT CAN TAKE DECADES SOMETIMES CENTURIES TO ASSESS THEIR IMPACT AND WE DON'T HAND DECADE SETTLEMENT CENTURIES WE'VE GOT TO GET ON WITH IT LET US AT LEAST TRIED TO PUT THE REFERENDUM INTO SOME KIND OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT I'M JOINED BY MARGARET AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL HISTORY AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY TIM STANLEY HISTORIAN LEADER WRITER AT THE TELEGRAPH IN HISTORICAL TERMS MARGARET MACMILLAN
VERY HARD TO TELL AND HISTORIANS HATE PREDICTING THE FUTURE THAT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT REALLY WE ALL LOOK BACK AND TAKE THINGS DID CHANGE THEN WHAT IT MEANS I THINK IS NOT YET CLEAR BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S WEAKENED THE EUROPEAN UNION ITALY WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO A VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING BRITISH ISLES THE MAPS THE MAPS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
AND WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN A LONG RUN AT A TIME WHICH WE KNOW IS ALREADY TURBULENT WHEN THERE IS TROUBLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD MAJOR ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE TO DEAL WITH THE SPREAD OF RADICAL TERRORIST MOVEMENTS AND COVERT DEVELOPING STRATEGIC ISSUE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES RUSSIA'S FLEXING ITS MUSCLES THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO HAVE YOUR WEAKENED DO YOU DO THAT
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE LATTER SAT SENTIMENT BUT I DO ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT HISTORIANS ARE VERY BAD AT PREDICTING THINGS AND WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT BECOMES A REAL HISTORICAL EVENT THERE REALLY A REAL HISTORICAL EVENT BUT MY SUSPICION IS THAT WILL COME TO SEE THIS AS INEVITABLE AND NOT QUITE AS THE ENORMOUS SURPRISING SHOCK NOT QUITE AS REVOLUTIONARY AS IT FEELS RIGHT NOW THE WAY I SEE IT EUROPE HE'S BEEN DEVELOPING IN ONE WAY FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AND BRITAIN HAS NOT WANTED TO TAKE PART DAVID CAMERAS NEGOTIATIONS LEFT US PRETTY MUCH ON THE PERIPHERY
ANYWAY EUROPE IS MOVING TOWARDS INTEGRATION BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAT MORE OR LESS ABOUT THE EUROZONE NOW AND WE WEREN'T PART OF THAT SOME MY SUSPICIONS THAT IN DECADES TO COME WE'LL SEE THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT BRITAIN POLITELY GOT OFF THE BUS WITHOUT ANY MASSIVE EFFECT ON THE REST OF THE WORLD
I DON'T I DON'T SEE THAT I'VE NEVER SAID BECAUSE I DON'T REGARD THE EELS HAVING ENORMOUS STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO SAY TACKLING ISIS OR PEWTER IN ECONOMIC WITH PURELY ECONOMIC OR AT LEAST WE'RE CONSTANTLY TOLD US JUST ECONOMIC IF IT ISN'T JUST ECONOMIC AND IT IS ACTUALLY POLITICAL HAS MUCH BIGGER THAN DAVID CAMERON KEPT ON TELLING US IT WAS MARGARET
I THINK YES I THINK EUROPE IS MUCH MORE AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN MUCH MORE THAN ANY INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND I THINK BRITAIN IN THAT SENSE HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE PART OF EUROPE UM IN YOUR HISTORY IS DEEPLY ENTWINED WITH THAT OF OTHER EUROPEAN NATIONS AND I ATTEMPT IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT I TEND TO LOOK AT THE CHANNEL AS AS A PATHWAY BETWEEN THE BRITISH ISLES AND EUROPE OTHERS CAN LOOK AT IT AS A BARRIER AN OBSTACLE AND I THINK BRITAIN WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED WITH EUROPE ON MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS I THINK WE MUSTN'T SEE THE E.U. AS STANDING FOR EUROPE FOR THE AS UNDERSTANDING FOR YOU BUT WHAT WORRIES ME
IS A PART OF THE WORLD THAT HAS BECOME IN SPITE OF ITS DREADFUL HISTORY BUFF AND A VERY DREADFUL HISTORY AN OASIS OF STABILITY DEMOCRACY AND CO OPERATION WILL NOW BEGIN TO FRACTURE AGAIN AND I THINK THE EFFECT OF THE BRITISH LEAVING WILL SPEED UP THOSE FRACTURES I MADE I'M REALLY HOPING I'M WRONG AND I'M HOPING TIM IS RIGHT I AGREE I DON'T I'M NOT DISAGREEING BUT IT IS FRACTURED BUT AGAIN I THINK THE FACTORING BEGAN ABOUT AT LEAST FIVE YEARS AGO IT'S THERE WITH THE AUSTERITY PROBLEMS IN GREECE
IT'S THERE WITH THE RISE MARINE LE PEN AND IT'S THERE WITH YOUR CRANE EVEN IN YUGOSLAVIA AND THE ETHNIC WARS THERE FOR ME BRITAIN BRITAIN CHOOSING TO LEAVE IS PROBABLY GOING TO TOWN TO BE A LESS DRAMATIC PART OF THAT STORY THAN IT SEEMS EUROPE IS IN TURMOIL IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BRITAIN ISN'T IT WHAT DO YOU AGREE WITH IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BRITAIN OH ABSOLUTELY ANAND AND I AGREE THAT THE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN THERE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN CONTAINED IN EUROPE HAS MANY DEMONS
I THINK THOSE DEMONS HAVE MORE OR LESS BEEN KEPT UNDER CONTROL NOT COMPLETE WE SAW THE HIDEOUS THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHEN YUGOSLAVIA BROKE UP BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT CONCERNS ME IS HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THOSE SPLITS WITHIN EUROPE AND NOW YOU HAVE A BRITAIN WHICH HAS LEFT WILL THAT MAKE IT WAS AS I SAY I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M I AM MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE THAN I'VE BEEN FOR SOME TIME
AND YOU'RE NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M NOT SO WORRIED BECAUSE I THINK THAT EUROPE'S DEMONS ARE NOT OURS WE'VE BEEN TALKING OURSELVES DOWN AND THEY NEVER DO PRETTY FOR OTHERS THAT DWELLS NOT VERY WIDE WEED WE HAVE NOT GOT THE SAME HISTORY OF DICTATORSHIPS THE SAME HISTORY OF ETHNIC CONFLICT WE ARE AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENS ON THE COALITION CERTAINLY AFFECTED BY IT BUT AS I SAY I THINK WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FEEL THEY'VE DONE IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO CAUTERIZE THEMSELVES FROM EUROPEAN PROMS THERE MIGHT BE MISLEADING THEMSELVES
BUT I I DON'T REGARD US AS BEING SUCKED IN TO EUROPE'S PROBLEMS I REGARD THIS ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT THE WORD OURS MARGARET TAYLOR WELL I WOULDN'T SEE THEM AS EUROPE'S PROBLEMS I MEAN I'D NEVER I'M A CANADIAN SO WHEN I LOOK ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AND WE ALL DO IN CANADA WE SAY EUROPE MEANING THE BRITISH ISLES OR NOT AND THE CONTINENT WE DON'T DRAW THIS DIVISION
SO I THINK MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY THE RED ACROSS BOUNDARIES I THINK THEY'RE NOT NATIONAL BOUNDARIES POPULIST NATIONALISM IT'S ALL OVER EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA TOO O.K. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH HAVE TO END IT DOWN SORRY MARGARET MACMILLAN TIM STANLEY THANK YOU BOTH
