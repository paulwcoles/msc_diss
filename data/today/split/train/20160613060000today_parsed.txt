I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS ARE HORRIFIC ACT OF TERROR AND HE COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN
IN SUCH AN INCLUSIVE AND FIRST PLACE
FLORIDA A CONGRESSWOMAN TELLS US THE MASCOT WILL NOT COMPEL LAWMAKERS THERE TO BE TOUGHER ON GUN CONTROL CAN ONCE AGAIN BE SILENT AND THE ISSUE OF DOWN I WOULD
IT'S A LOT OF PRAYERS AND NOT ANY ACTION
ALSO IN THE PROGRAMME WE'LL BE SPEAKING LIVE TO GORDON BROWN WHO'S URGING LABOUR VOTERS TO BACK THE U.K.'S REMAINING IN THE Y. YOU'D AVOID WHAT HE CALLS A TORY BRECK SET AND WE'LL HEAR FROM MOSCOW ON HOW THE BRECK SAID DEBATE IS SEEN FOR INSIDE THE KREMLIN MOSCOW SEES EVERYTHING AS AS THERE ARE SOME GAME SO WHAT'S BAD FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION AS GOOD FOR RUSSIA AS JUST A SYMBOL OF THAT THE B.B.C. NEWS READ THIS MORNING BY CHRIS
THE F.B.I. SAYS THE GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIFTY PEOPLE IN FLORIDA IN THE EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY MORNING HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED OVER HIS ALLEGED TIES TO TERRORISTS BUT WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A THREAT AGENTS INTERVIEWED OBAMA TEEN ON THREE OCCASIONS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN HIS ATTACK ON A GAY NIGHTCLUB IS THE DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY A CORRESPONDENT TO LEHMAN BULL REPORTS FROM ORLANDO
AS THE DEPRESSING LIST OF VICTIMS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED GETS LONGER MORE DETAILS ARE EMERGING OF THE MAN WHO SHOT THEM DEAD AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB OH MUM HAD SEEN THE TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD U.S. CITIZEN OF AFGHAN ORIGIN CALLED NINE ONE ONE BEFORE THE ATTACK DECLARING HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE HEAD OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE THE ENTERED THE CLUB AT ABOUT TWO A.M. FIRING IT WILL WITH TWO WEAPONS A HANDGUN AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HAVE BOTH BEEN BOUGHT WITHIN THE LAST WEEK
THE F.B.I. SAID HE'D INTERVIEWED OMAN THE TEAM ON THREE OCCASIONS BUT DECIDED ANY LINKS TO MILITANT ISLAM WERE TENUOUS MANY ARE NOW ASKING WHETHER MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT SUCH A HORRIFIC ATTACK
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DESCRIBED THE SHOOTING AS AN ACT OF TERROR AND HATE BUT THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP CALLED ON MISTER OBAMA TO RESIGN FOR REFUSING TO USE THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM AND CONDEMNING THE ATTACK THE BUSINESSMAN SAID AMERICA COULD NOT BE POLITICALLY CORRECT ANY MORE AS OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT EXPLAINS
BOTH THE TIMING AND TONE OF HIS COMMENTS ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT HE THANKS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR CONGRATULATIONS ABOUT BEING WRITERS HE PUT IT A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM HAVE BROUGHT AN ACID SHOWER OF CRITICISM FROM OPPONENTS
A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CALLED THE BILLIONAIRE A NARCISSISTIC MAN BABY WHO TURNED A NATIONAL TRAGEDY INTO A MOMENT OF SELF CONGRATULATION BUT DONALD TRUMP AS SEVE REPEATEDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE ATTACKS ON PARIS SAN BERNARDINO AND BRUSSELS THAT HIS UNCOMPROMISING REMARKS PARTLY EXPLAIN HIS POLITICAL SUCCESS
POLICE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ARRESTED A HEAVILY ARMED MAN WHO SAID HE WAS PLANNING TO ATTEND THE GAY PRIDE MARCH IN LOS ANGELES THEY DISMISSED EARLIER REPORTS WHICH SUGGEST THAT HE WANTED TO HARM THE EVENT THAT THEY SAY THE MAN IS BEING HELD ON EXPLOSIVES AND WEAPONS CHARGES AFTER HE WAS FOUND WITH THREE ASSAULT RIFLES CHEMICALS AND A GAS MASK THE REST IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE LINKED TO THE SHOOTINGS IN ORLANDO
GORDON BROWN IS TO LEAD A FRESH ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE LABOUR VOTERS TO SUPPORT E.U. MEMBERSHIP OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER WILL USE HER SPEECH THIS MORNING TO INSIST THAT THE E. U. CABBIE REFORM FROM WITHIN AND DELIVER POLICIES THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE HEARTS OF PARTY SUPPORTERS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON REPORTS
GORDON BROWN WILL MAKE WHAT HE'S CALLING THE POSITIVE CASE FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. INCLUDING ACTION WITH OTHER MEMBER STATES TO CREATE JOBS HELPED ENVIRONMENT AND CLAMP DOWN AND CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE
THE CHANGE OF TONE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE LABOUR SOURCES SAY THEIR OWN FOCUS GROUPS WERE SUGGESTING THAT PROJECT FEAR WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING PROJECT FEEL YEAH
THE LABOUR M.P. JESUS STEWART PICTURES THE OFFICIAL REEVE CAMPAIGN SAID THAT HER PARTY'S VOTERS HAD THOSE SEEING THROUGH GOVERNMENT SPIN AND NO AMOUNT OF HISTORY COBBLED TOGETHER RELAUNCHES WOULD CHANGE THAT
A STUDY HAS FORECAST THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN IN THE Y. U. NET MIGRATION WILL RUN AT MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION A YEAR FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS THE REPORT BY THE GROUP MIGRATION WATCH SAYS THERE'S WIDESPREAD COMPLACENCY AND DENIAL ABOUT BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE IMPACT OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH HERE'S SIMON CLEVER
THE CAMPAIGN GROUP SAYS IT'S PREDICTION FOR NET MIGRATION IF BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE E.U. IS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THE POPULATION OF SOUTHAMPTON ARRIVING EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS MIGRATION WATCH IS CONCERNED ABOUT A RISE IN NUMBERS PUTTING PRESSURE ON TRANSPORT AND HOUSING ITS CHAIRMAN LORD GREEN CLAIMS THE REPORT IS A WAKE UP CALL HE SAYS THE U.K.'S POPULATION COULD REACH EIGHTY MILLION WITHIN THIRTY YEARS
IN RESPONSE THE IMMIGRATION MINISTER AND REMAIN CAMPAIGNER JAMES BROKEN TRY SAID QUITTING EUROPE WOULD DAMAGE THE ECONOMY AND THAT WAS NOT THE ANSWER TO THE COMPLEX ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION
EIGHTY AND TWO TRADE UNIONS REPRESENTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS AT THE TELECOMS GROUP ARE TO ISSUE A JOINT STATEMENT TODAY SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. IT'S THOUGHT THE MEMO TO MORE THAN EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND BRITISH BASED EMPLOYEES WERE WARNED OF THE ECONOMIC RISKS OF A VOTE TO LEAVE
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM IS TO URGE M.P.S TO SUPPORT A SO CALLED HILLSBOROUGH LAW WHICH WOULD ENSURE BEREAVED FAMILIES RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS POLICE OF INQUESTS CLAIMS THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES TWENTY SEVEN YEAR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE SHOWS HOW THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST ORDINARY PEOPLE

THANK YOU NOT SHIT IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SIX LET US TURN FIRST TO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE WEEKEND THAT ATTACK ON A GAY NIGHT NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN RECENT U.S. HISTORY AS WE WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS PRESIDENT OBAMA ORDERING FLAGS ON FEDERAL BUILDINGS TO BE FLOWN AT HALF MAST UNTIL SUNSET ON THURSDAY AND THEN ORLANDO FRIENDS AND RELATIVES SINGING HAD A CANDLELIT VIGIL
OH
WHETHER AT LEAST FIFTY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED IN THE ATTACK SOME ARE STILL SAID TO BE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION IN HOSPITAL AN EYE WITNESS WHO SURVIVE TO DESCRIBE A HE USED HIS BANDANNA TO STEM A VICTIMS BLEEDING
THERE WAS A GUY LAYING THERE IN THE BACK AND PUT THEM ON MY SHOULDER THE HELP HIM TO PLAY ASS AND I TAKE THAT MENTALLY
WOULD IT GOOD SHOUT JUST COS ANYONE COME TO PLEAD OUT THERE HE'S EVERYWHERE
ANOTHER GIRL VERSION IRONMITE HELPS HER WE WRAPPED IT
AWAKE BUT STILL HAS THREE HE'S STILL HERE OR THERE BUT HAS IT HAD ON HIM
IT WAS JUST YOU CONTINUOUS IT WASN'T LIKE IT'S LIKE YOU HAD A GUN RANGE IN THERE ARE YOU HERE IS
DIFFICULT TO SEE IN REAL LIFE
IN A HORRIBLE SITUATION PRESIDENT OBAMA DESCRIBED IT AS AN ACT OF TERROR AND AN ACT OF HATE HE SAID IT WAS A FURTHER REMINDER OF HOW EASY IT WAS FOR AMERICANS TO ACQUIRE DEADLY WEAPONS THE F.B.I. SAID THE GUNMAN OMAR MARTINE
STATED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE ISLAMIC STATE MILITANT GROUP IN A CALL TO THE EMERGENCY SERVICES HE WAS EVENTUALLY SHOT DEAD BY POLICE THE FLORIDA SENATOR FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL MARCO RUBIO SAID VIOLENT HOMEGROWN RADICALISATION WAS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE TO U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY SING ALONG LOOK SINGLE LARGEST LOSS OF LIFE WE'VE HEARD THE GUNFIRE IN AMERICAN HISTORY TERRORIST ATTACK HAD HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL INSPIRED
DIRECTIVE I THINK PARTLY INSPIRED BY ISIS SUN LINE TOOK ACTION
FIFTY PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES ANOTHER FIFTY OR SO WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THE KILLERS EX WIFE HAS ALSO BEEN TALKING TO REPORTERS DESCRIBING HIM AS AN EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE AND VIOLENT MAN THIS WAS A SICK PERSON THAT WAS REALLY
WHEN CRAZY HE WOULD BE PERFECT WE KNOW I'M UNHAPPY DRINKING LAUGHING ONE MINUTE AND THEN NEXT MINUTE HE'S TEMPERANCE WOULD BE
HE WOULD JUST
THE OPPOSITE YOU KNOW ANGER
VIAL
HUGE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE IN THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING OF COURSE OF THAT STORY THERE PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY IT DOESN'T MAKE THE LEAD STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF ALL THE PAPERS A LOT OF EDITORIAL COMMENT AS WELL THE TIMES HAS A POWERFUL LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT SAYS THIS ABOVE ALL
THIS MASSACRE POSES A QUESTION FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW MUCH DO THEY CARE BUT MORE AMERICANS DIED IN GUN RELATED HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES BETWEEN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THAN HAVE DIED IN EVERY WAR THE COUNTRY HAS FOUGHT EVEN ON A PER CAPITA BASIS THE RATE OF GUN RELATED MURDERS IN THE U.S. IS NEARLY THIRTY TIMES HIGHER THAN IN BRITAIN NEITHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL NEED TO PROMISE SERIOUS REFORM OF U. S. GUN LAWS
AS A RESULT OF THIS TRAGEDY BECAUSE EVEN BOATERS WHO YEARN FOR IT DO NOT EXPECT IT AMERICA'S FRIENDS HAVE THE DUTY TO REMIND A GREAT COUNTRY BUT IT'S CHERISHED SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT SACRED DOCTRINE IT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A LICENCE TO KILL
TO OTHER MATTERS CHOLESTEROL DOES NOT CAUSE HEART DISEASE IN THE ELDERLY AND TRYING TO REDUCE IT WITH DRUGS STATINS MAINLY IS A WASTE OF TIME THIS ACCORDING TO EXPERTS WRITING THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE ISN'T A LINK BETWEEN SO CALLED BAD CHOLESTEROL THE PREMATURE DEATH OF OVER SIXTIES FROM CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE PLAINLY HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL REPORT SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO LATER ON THE PROGRAMME THAT TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX OSCAR PISTORIUS THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD MEDAL WINNER WHO KILLED HIS WIFE IS GOING TO GO BACK TO JAIL MUMS A MISTAKE IT WAS A CORRESPONDENT IN PRETORIA BIT OF BACKGROUND HE WAS CONVICTED WHEN
THAT'S CORRECT OSCAR PER PISTORIUS WAS CONVICTED LAST YEAR OF CULPABLE HOMICIDE BUT THEN THE STAID WANTED THERE'D CONVICTION TO BE OVERTURNED SAYING THEY'RE DEAD THE JUDGE TO WAS IT MY SUPER HEAD
NOT REPRESENTED OR MISREPRESENTED THE HE DID THE CULPABLE HOMICIDE CONVICTION AND THEREFORE WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEAL IN WHICH THAT CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED INTO BED OF MURDER SO AS WE STAND AT THIS MORNING ASK AT THE STORIES WILL BE GREETED BY VERY RARE MADE A WINTER RAIN WHEN HE ARRIVES HERE AT THE HIGH COURT TO LISTEN TO HIS RE SENTENCING WE ARE LIKELY TO
THREE WITNESSES EACH SIDE IN MITIGATION AND AGGRAVATION OF SENTENCING WHAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE IN SOUTH AFRICA TO TO THIS TO HE'S NOW BEING CONVICTED OF MURDER AND POSSIBILITY OF FACING A VERY VERY LONG JAIL SENTENCES
WELL IT DEPENDS WHO YOU SPEAK TO THOSE WHO SUPPORT OSCAR PISTORIUS BELIEVE THAT THE FACT THAT HE HAS ALREADY SPENT ONE YEAR IN PRISON MEANS THAT HE HAS ALREADY BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH BUT THOSE WHO FELT THEY'D THE THE THE MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION WAS LENIENT AS SAYING THEY'RE DERBY THEY WANT HIM TO SPEND MORE TIME IN JAIL AND ALSO OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM STAYED FROM THE STATE PROSECUTOR
HE SAYS THAT HE WILL BE PUSHING FOR A MINIMUM SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS IN PRISON BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS THAT HE INTENDED TO KILL SOMEBODY WHEN HE FIRED THROUGH THAT BATHROOM NOT EVEN IF HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS MISTY ENCAMP IN THE TOILET
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT CAME OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEAL WHEN THE STATE PROSECUTOR WANTED THAT BUT THE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGES OR CONVICTION TO BE OVERTURNED SAYING THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO THAT PERSON WISE BUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS INTENDING TO SHOOT WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING WHOEVER WAS BEHIND THE DOOR MEANS THAT HE SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER AND THAT IS WHY HE'S NOW BEEN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND IT DID BECOME DIDN'T IT A FEMINIST ISSUE IN SOUTH AFRICA
THAT'S CORRECT BECAUSE WE HAVE IN SOUTH AFRICA A LOT OF CASES IN WHICH WOMEN DIE AT THEIR HANDS OF THE PARTNERS IT'S CALLED INTIMATE FILM INSIDE THE HUGE NUMBERS IN SOUTH AFRICA WIN WHICH PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY'D THEIR BOW HUGE NUMBERS IN WHICH
BASICALLY THE PEOPLE AND WOMEN KILLED BY THEIR LOVERS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED BY PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW PEOPLE THAT THE INTIMATE WITH AND WHICH IS WHILE WE SAW WIDESPREAD PROTEST NOT JUST FROM THE SEE WOMEN'S LEAGUE BACK FROM OTHER N.G.O.S BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTING OSCAR PISTORIUS HAVE ALSO BEEN THERE PROTESTING OUTSIDE CAUGHT SO MANY THANKS
QUARTER PAST SIX FANFARE TIME WE HAVE A NEW BUSINESS PRESENTERS STARTING THIS MORNING SOON TO BE A HOUSEHOLD NAME DOMINATE O'CONNELL WELCOME ALREADY ALREADY A HOUSEHOLD THEY WILL CERTAINLY IN HIS MIND HERE AND PLENTY OF OTHERS ANYWAY HOW PALLY IZZY WITH THE TOP BOSSES OF THE NATION'S BUSINESS IS NOT VERY IT WOULD SEEM BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY TAKING THEM TO TASK OVER THEIR PAY INCLUDING THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST HOUSE BUILDERS WHO ARE ON TRACK TO MAKE SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS DOMINIC I CAN'T ALL THE STAGE IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUSTIN YES WE HAVE ANOTHER SHAREHOLDER PROCESS THAT ARE PAID
THIS TIME AT PERSIMMON THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED HOUSE BUILDER THE TOP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EXECUTIVES ARE ON TRACK TO SHOW AN ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WHICH MAKES THIS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BONUS POOLS EVER OUTSIDE OF BANKING ONE BIG FUND MANAGER ROYAL LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT HAS URGED THE BOARD TO SHOW RESTRAINT GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS
I ASKED MIKE FOX ROYAL LONDON'S HIT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TO EXPLAIN JUST HOW THE SCHEME WORKS IT ISN'T USUAL IT WAS A SCHEME THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT WAS WAS THAT IF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM RHYS EARNED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK TO SHAREHOLDERS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY WOULD BE REWARDED BY SHARES IN THE COMPANY
THAT MONEY THAT THEY WOULD RETURN WOULD REFLECT THE SUCCESS OF THE BUSINESS AND SO IN THEORY IT WAS LINKED INTO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY HOWEVER SUBSEQUENTLY THE BUSINESS HAS PERFORMED FAR BETTER THAN EXPECT HE'S AN IMMENSE WHY THE AWARDS COULD POTENTIALLY BE VERY LARGE IF EVERYTHING WENT AMAZINGLY WELL
HOW MUCH COULD THE SCHEME PAY PAYOUT TO THE TOP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MANAGERS SO THERE ARE CERTAIN PARAMETERS THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN FIXED WHICH HIS SHARE PRICE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GIVE A PRECISE AMOUNT HOWEVER IN THEORY THE MAXIMUM AWARD TO THE HUNDRED FORTY IS COULD BE UP TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF WHICH THE HE COULD GET UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF THAT
IT COULD BE MORE THOUGH COULDN'T IT PERSIMMON SHARES DO REALLY WELL THEY COULD GET EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT'S CORRECT AND I THINK IT'S ONE IMPORTANT POINT TO SAY HERE IS THAT PERSIMMON SHARES HAVE DONE VERY WELL SO WE'RE NOT HERE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCES BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH EFFECTIVELY IN TERMS OF REWARD
WHY THEN HAS ROYAL LONDON VOTED AGAINST THIS THIS PAY SCHEME BOTH EDITS INCEPTION EVERY YEAR SINCE IF IT ALIGNS MANAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS ISN'T THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHEN WE DID FACE AGAINST IT WE DID FEEL THAT THE LEVEL OF REWARD WAS TOO HIGH TO GIVE AWAY TEN PER CENT OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS SHAREHOLDERS IS TO OUR DETRIMENT
YOU CAN HEAR THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH MIKE FOX AT SEVEN FIFTEEN PERSIMMON HAS DEFENDED THE PAY OUT SAYING THAT SINCE THE SCHEME WAS ADOPTED IT'S INCREASING NUMBER OF HOMES ARE BUILT BY HALF AND RETURN ONE BILLION POUND TO SHAREHOLDERS
TODAY IS THE START OF THE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL FOR BUSINESS AND GIANT JAMBOREE IN LIVERPOOL THAT AIMS TO SHOWCASE BRITISH EXPORTS AND LURE IN WITHAM INVESTORS THERE'LL BE THIRTY THOUSAND DELEGATES ATTENDING OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IT LOOKS LIKE AN INTERESTING LIST OF THE TEN D. SOME OBVIOUS NAMES LIKE SONJI JAB AT THE BUSINESS SECRETARY AND SOME LESS OBVIOUS ONES INCLUDING HAMID KARZAI FORMER PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN
I'M JOINED BY ONE OF THE STAR ATTRACTIONS SIR TERRY LEAHY ONE OF BRITAIN'S BEST KNOWN BUSINESS PEOPLE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TESCO AND NOW CHAIRMAN OF B. AND IN RETAIL SIR TERRY THIS FESTIVAL WAS PARTLY YOUR IDEA WASN'T IT
YES IT WAS A ROSE REPORT WITH MICHAEL HESELTINE ABOUT THE FUTURE FOR LIVERPOOL AND ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THAT WE SHOULD HOLD A FESTIVAL SUCH AS THIS WHICH HAS NOW BECOME THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BUSINESS FESTIVAL AND A VERY IMPORTANT SHOWCASE FOR BRITISH EXPORTERS IS IT WHAT'S IT LIKE IS IT A KIND OF A MERSEYSIDE DEVILS
IN A WAY IN THE SENSE THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COME FROM COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT REAL DEALS ARE DONE CONNECTIONS NETWORKING OR TAKES PLACE AND PEOPLE GET NEW IDEAS ABOUT THE FUTURE DIRECTION FOR THEIR BUSINESS YOU SHOW YOU SAY REAL DEALS ARE DONE WHAT EVIDENCE HAS THESE KIND OF MEETINGS ACTUALLY DO GOOD FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY
THE FIRST FESTIVAL TOOK PLACE TWO YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS CAREFULLY STUDIED AND SOMETHING LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF DEALS CAME OUT FOR BRITISH BUSINESS DIRECTLY FROM THE FESTIVAL MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND JOBS WERE CREATED TO ACTUALLY HUNDREDS OF FIRMS EXPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME WHY WHY IS IT A LIVERPOOL WHAT WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT LIVERPOOL AND ALL THAT THAT MEANS THAT IT NEEDS THIS KIND OF EVENT
IT'S GREAT THAT IT IS IN LIVERPOOL NOT IN GERMANY OR AMERICA OR CHINA WHERE YOU NORMALLY ASSOCIATE THESE BIG TRADE FINANCE IT'S PART OF THE ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE OF THE CITY FOR MANY YEARS HAD STRUGGLED LOTS OF STORIES OF SOCIAL DEPRIVATION GOT A BIT CUT OFF FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANY MORE THERE'S BEEN A HUGE PHYSICAL
TRANSFORMATION OF THE CITY IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL CITY PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE AND WORK THERE AND THE ECONOMY NOW IT'S PICKING UP IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING CITY REGIONS OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THESE THINGS ARE GOOD FOR THE IMAGE OF THIS SUSPECT DO YOU THINK THE BUSINESS NOW HAS A BIT OF AN IMAGE PROBLEM WE'VE HAD IN RECENT WEEKS THE B.H.S. AFIA EARED AND PARLIAMENT WE'VE HAD A SIMILAR THING WITH MIKE ASHLEY IN BEING IN PARLIAMENT FOR SPORTS DIRECT
I'LL BE SORT OF BACK WE WEREN'T TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE'RE WE'RE BUSINESS WAS TAKING A POUNDING AFTER THE CREDIT CRISIS WELL FROM A CONSUMER'S PERSPECTIVE BUSINESS DOES A GREAT JOB IF YOU THINK OF FOOD AND CLOTHING AND CARS AND PAYMENT SYSTEM
DRUGS THEY THEY WORK FOR CONSUMERS BUT I THINK WHEN THEY READ THESE STORIES A CITIZEN'S PEOPLE WORRY I THINK THAT BUSINESS MUST BE VERY CAREFUL ALWAYS TO EXPLAIN THE GOOD THAT IT DOES BECAUSE IT CREATES THE WEALTH FROM WHICH ALL OUR SOCIAL ASPIRATIONS CAN BE MET D. DO YOU THINK THEY NEED TO TRY HARDER DE BUSINESSMEN NEED MORE TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC BEER THE RIGHT TO OPERATE
THEY NEED TO TAKE TIME AND BE CAREFUL ALWAYS TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY BENEFIT SOCIETY AND THERE'LL BE ONE OR TWO CASES LIKE BANKING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WERE MAYBE THAT BALANCE IS WRONG IN OR TAKING OUT MORE THAN THEY'RE PUTTING IN AND THEN THEY NEED TO CHANGE AS BANKING IS CHANGING I BELIEVE HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S COME OUT DURING THE WHOLE B.H.S. SAGA
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A CASUALTY OF COMPETITION ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT COMPETITION IS IT PUTS CHOICE IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN PICK WINNERS BUT OF COURSE THAT DOES MEAN LOSERS AND B.H.S. HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP
IT IS WORRYING OF COURSE THAT WHAT HAS EMERGED AS THIS HUGE PENSION DEFICIT AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT COMPETITION THERE'S MORE COMPETITION COMING IN RETAILING ISN'T PARTICULARLY IN YOUR OLD STAMPING GROUND OF GROCERIES AMAZON HAS SAID THAT IT'S GOING TO START DELIVERING FOR A SHREWD AND BRITAIN IS THIS A BIG THREAT TO THE TO THE THE BIG ESTABLISHED SUPERMARKET CHAIN
WHAT IS MORE COMPETITION BUT THEN THAT'S GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER ACTUALLY THE U.K. AS A WORLD LEADER IN E. COMMERCE ALREADY THAT ARE WONDERFUL SERVICES TO DELIVER ONLINE FOOD TO PEOPLE'S HOMES SO ACTUALLY AMAZON MAY FIND IT HARDER TO MAKE PROGRESS HERE THAN IN SOME OTHER MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR TERRY LEAHY RETURN TO THE MARKETS AND I GUESS AS PARIS AMANDA HEAD OF EUROPEAN INIQUITIES THAT FOR DEALT INTERNATIONAL STARTING OFF BACK ON ON B.H.S. PARIS OVER THE WEEKEND WE HEARD THAT SIR PHILIP GREEN MAY NOT ATTAINED IN THIS MORNING THAT MICHAEL SHERWOOD HE'S THE HE'S THE HEAD OF GOLDMAN SACHS IN THE U.K. MAY ALSO DECLINED A REQUEST TO ATTEND THE YEAR THE SELECT COMMITTEE DO YOU THINK EITHER OF THEM WILL ACTUALLY STAY AWAY WHEN IT COMES TO
I THINK ONE HAS TO TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE END THAT THEY THAT THEY WILL BOTH ATTEND IF BEING REQUIRED TO DO SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A SHAME ABOUT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SAGA IS THAT A LOT OF BIG PERSONALITIES INVOLVED IT'S EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING OF A SOAP OPERA IN THE REAL ISSUE THAT IS AT THE HEART OF IT WHICH IS THE POTENTIAL JOB LOSSES THE ISSUE OF THE PENSION FUND THAT RISKS BEING KIND OF SLIGHTLY MARGINALISED BY SOME OF THE MORE SENSATIONAL ELEMENTS OF THIS NEW STORY
AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING WAS THIS EXTRAORDINARY AREA ERA OF LOW BORROWING COSTS THAT WE HAVE ONE HEADLINE PUT IT LAST WEEK THAT WE HAD THE LOWEST INTEREST RATES SINCE THE BRONZE AGE THIS IS RELATED TO B.H.S. BECAUSE THE LOW INTEREST RATES MEAN THAT THE PENSION DEFICIT IS VERY LARGE
COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN HOW THAT WORKS AND WHY THIS IS AN INTERESTING TIME FOR B.H.S. WELL ABSOLUTELY UM INTEREST TO TRY AND KEEP IT VERY SIMPLE I MEAN THAT THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE ESTIMATE THE SCALE OF PENSION DEFICITS IS USING ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY WILL USE IS THE PREVAILING DISCOUNT RATES THAT DISCOUNT RATE FALLS IT INCREASES THE QUANTUM NEEDED TO TO COVER TO COVER THAT THAT THE PENSION DEFICIT
IT ALSO ADVERTISES DOMINIC A VERY IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THIS ABOUT THIS SUBJECT WHICH IS THAT IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO LOOK AT THE PATIENT DEATHS AT A POINT IN TIME BUT WHEN THEY COME TO EXAMINE WHAT'S HAPPENED AT B.H.S. THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW THE PENSION HAS BEEN MANAGED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS RATHER THAN JUST WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE A SNAPSHOT THIS LOW INTEREST RATES HAVE AN EFFECT IN THE REAL WORLD DON'T THEY
WE HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON OF BANKS CHOOSING TO PUT THEIR CASH IN WAREHOUSES RATHER THAN GIVING IT TO CENTRAL BANKS ON DEPOSIT BECAUSE THEY LOSE MONEY THIS IS A THIS IS BIZARRE IT'S CASH UNDER THE MATTRESS TIME ISN'T AN ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES TO TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IS THIS A A VERY LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE STATE OF THE WORLD OR IS IT LIKELY TO BE WITH US FOR A VERY SHORT TIME ONLY YOU THINK THIS MIGHT REVERSE YOU THINK INTEREST RATES COULD
COME BACK QUITE QUICKLY I THINK THAT THE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS AS ABSENCE IS THE ISSUE OF INFLATION AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION WE THINK THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE THAT ACTUALLY INFLATION COULD SURPRISE ON THE UPSIDE OVER THE NEXT SORT OF SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY PUT PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF INTEREST RATES IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THEN GET USED TO THOSE SUPER LOW INTEREST RATES FOREVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH HARRISON AND FIDEL INTERNATIONAL THANK YOU
THANKS DOMINIC TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND HE WAS ROB WITH THE SPORT THANKS JOHN GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO ONE WIN ONE DRAWER AND ONE DEFEAT FOR THE HOME NATIONS AFTER THEIR FIRST MATCH IS IT EURO TWENTY SIXTEEN THE DEFEAT YESTERDAY EVENING FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AGAINST POLAND

REFERENDUM
B.B.C. RADIO FOUR'S MORE OR LESS ANALYSES THE FIGURES BEHIND IT THE E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WE ARE AS ALWAYS YOUR GUIDE TO THE NUMBERS THAT SURROUND US IN THE NEWS
WE COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THAT A LOT OF THE REFERENDUM COVERAGE INVOLVES TWO POLITICIANS SHOUTING CONTRADICTORY STATISTICS AT EACH OTHER ENTERTAINING IF YOU LIKE THAT SORT OF THING
BUT NOT EXACTLY HELPFUL SO IN THIS SERIES WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TALKING TO THE POLITICIANS AT ALL WE'RE JUST GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH
BRACING CONCEPT ISN'T IT TIM HARFORD WITH MORE OR LESS THE E.U. REFERENDUM BY NUMBERS ALL THIS WEEK AT MIDDAY
LET'S BUST SIX YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB JOHN HUMPHRYS AND CHRIS ALDRIDGE FOR THEM IT WAS THE F.B.I. SAYS THE GUNMAN WHO CARRIED OUT THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN U.S. HISTORY HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED TWICE FOR POSSIBLE TERRORISM LINKS AND QUESTION THREE TIMES BUT AGENTS CONCLUDED HE WASN'T A THREAT OBAMA TEAM PHONE THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP BEFORE KILLING FIFTY PEOPLE IN A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DESCRIBED THE MASSACRE AS AN ACT OF TERROR AND HATE AND HAS REPEATED HIS CALL FOR TIGHTENING OF GUN CONTROL LAWS IT'S EMERGED THAT MY TEAM HAD LEGALLY PURCHASED SEVERAL GARDENS
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR URGING BARACK OBAMA TO RESIGN FOR NOT USING THE PHRASE RADICAL ISLAM WHEN CONDEMNING THE KILLINGS MY TROUBLE SO REITERATED HIS CALL FOR MUSLIMS TO BE BANNED FROM ENTERING THE U.S. A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN TEAM SAID HE WAS A NARCISSIST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A NATIONAL TRAGEDY
GORDON BROWN IS TO MAKE A FRESH ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE LABOUR VOTERS TO BACK THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM IN A SPEECH HE WILL INSIST THAT THE E. U. CABBIE REFORM FROM WITHIN BUT LEAF CAMPAIGNERS SAY THE PROSPECT OF MEANINGFUL CHANGE ENDED WITH DAVID CAMERON FAILED TO GET A BETTER DEAL FOR BRITAIN IN HIS NEGOTIATIONS IN BRUSSELS
A STUDY HAS FORECAST THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. NET MIGRATION WILL EXCEED A QUARTER OF A MILLION EVERY YEAR FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS THE REPORT BY THE GROUP MIGRATION WATCH WHICH ONCE LOWER IMMIGRATION SAYS THERE'S WIDESPREAD COMPLACENCY AND DENIAL ABOUT BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE IMPACT OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM IS TO URGE M.P.S TO SUPPORT A SO CALLED HILLSBOROUGH LAW WHICH WOULD ENSURE BEREAVED FAMILIES RECEIVE THE SAME LEGAL FUNDING AS POLICE AT INQUESTS HE SAID THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES FIND SHOWED HOW THE ODDS WERE STACKED AGAINST ORDINARY PEOPLE SEEKING TRUTH AND JUSTICE

I'VE BEEN TALKING TO OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOAP AND HE TOLD ME HE WAS A LONE WOLF APPARENTLY NOT CONNECTED TO ANY ORGANISATION

THE SECURITY FIRM THERE HAD BEEN BACKGROUND CHECKS ON HIM AND HE WAS CONSIDERED SO ON REMARKABLE THAT HE CARRIED A WEAPON AS PART OF HIS JOB HE LIVED ACCORDING TO HIS NEIGHBOURS ACQUIRE QUIET LIFE HOWEVER THERE ARE DISTURBING ASPECTS TO IT AS WELL
HIS THEN WIFE SAID THAT AFTER FOUR MONTHS SHE HAD TO BE RESCUED BY MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY BECAUSE HE WAS VIOLENT AND SO YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO SINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RADICALISED AND RINGS NO ONE WON RINGS THE POLICE IN THE MIDST OF THIS SIEGE TO SAY I'M DOING THIS IN THE NAME OF ISLAMIC STATE AN ISLAMIC STATE OF SAID THEMSELVES THAT THEY KAT HE CARRIED OUT IN THEIR NAME
YOU'VE HAD SOMEONE WHO IS BENEATH THE RADAR FOR THE MOST PART OF THE SECURITY AGENCIES BUT WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN A COUNTRY WHERE IT IS THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD TO GO INTO A GUN SHOP AND SAY OH I'LL HAVE THAT NICE ASSAULT RIFLE
ON THE WALL PLEASE AND YOU KNOW WITH THE MOST SCANT AMOUNT OF CHECKS YOU WALK OUT WITH THAT PERHAPS THE MOST DANGEROUS PIECE OF WEAPONRY THAT YOU COULD HAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE WHAT HE'S DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE HE'S TOLD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE SHOCKING AND AMERICA HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YEAH I THINK IT IS THE FOURTEENTH OCCASION
WHERE HE HAS GONE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM TWO IS SUE WHAT FEELS LIKE A LAMENT YOU KNOW HE MUST HAVE A TEMPLATE SCRIPT ON HIS COMPUTER WHERE HE HITS F. EIGHT AND THE SPEECH COMES UP OF WHAT DO I SAY AFTER THE LATEST MUST SHOOTING AND HE VARIES IT A BIT ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT HE HAS BEEN UNABLE SINGULARLY UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW IT'S EVEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE WHEN YOU'VE GOT CONGRESS A POSE TO HIM BUT EVEN AFTER SANDY HOOK WHAT ALL THOSE SMALL KIDS
WERE GUNNED DOWN WHEN HE HAD A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO WHEN PEOPLE KIND OF ASK THE INEVITABLE QUESTION A REASONABLE QUESTION SURELY SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE I FOUND MYSELF SAYING JUST NOT GOING TO AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON UNLESS THERE IS A RADICAL CHANGE IN THE MAKE UP OF CONGRESS
AND THERE IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE POWER TO DRIVE IT THROUGH SO IS THIS THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR THE POWER OF THE LOBBIES OR THE CRAVEN NATURE OF MANY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR A COMBINATION OF ALL WHERE YOU'VE PUT YOUR FINGER ABSOLUTELY ON THE BUTTON BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY THE QUESTION WHEN SANDY HOOK HAPPENED
THAT OVERWHELMING SUPPORT AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE OPINION POLLS WERE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME TIGHTENING OF THE LEGISLATION THEY SHOULD BE A HEIGHTENING OF BACKGROUND CHECKS THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF RESTRICTION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ASSAULT WEAPONS LIKE THE ONE USED IN THAT ATTACK AND LIKE THE ONE USED IN THIS ATTACK
HOWEVER IT IS NOT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE'S SPEAKING IT IS THE WILL OF THE LOBBIES AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS FANTASTICALLY POWERFUL EXTRAORDINARILY WELL FUNDED
AND BRILLIANTLY ORGANISED GIVES MARKS OUT OF HOW GOOD HOW SOUND THIS CONGRESS MAN OR WOMAN IS ON GUN CONTROL ISSUES AND IF YOU STEP OUT OF LINE THEY WILL THREATEN TO WITHDRAW FUNDING FOR ME ALTERNATIVELY
THE RIVAL CANDIDATE TO DEPOSE YOU SO IT WASN'T JUST REPUBLICANS DON'T THINK IT WAS JUST REPUBLICANS WHO RESISTED BARACK OBAMA'S ATTEMPTS TO TIGHTEN GUN LAWS MANY DEMOCRATS AS WELL FOR REASONS OF FEAR DECIDED IT WASN'T WORTH TRYING TO TAKE ON THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION SO ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE A PUBLIC OPINION IN ONE PLACE
YOU HAVE THE CONFESSIONAL LEADERS IN QUITE ANOTHER PLACE AND TOO TIMID TO REALLY MOVE ON THIS ISSUE JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN IS THE TIME THE LOS ANGELES GAY PRIDE EVENT WAS TAKING PLACE JUST AFTER THE ATTACKS IN A LAMP AND A MAN WAS ARRESTED THERE WITH GUNS AND EXPLOSIVES IN HIS CAR ROBERT THATCHER WRETCHES ON THE LINE REPORTER FOR PRO REPUBLIC REPUBLIC AT THE NEWS WEBSITE AND DID WHAT WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS ARREST ROBERT HOOK THE MAN FOR ME ALREADY
MATERIAL CAN BE USED TO MAKE EXPLOSIVES ON IT OR A PLOY
O.K. BUT NO HOME AH SO THEY CLOSED DOWN THE MANNERS MADE ACCURATE IT COVERED ALL THESE WEAPONS AND EXPORTS
YOU'RE I'LL SLIM WHAT ONE ONE ONE AFTER WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR LAND THIS IS A LOT OF THE TIME BUT ARE THEY LINKING THE TWO
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE TUMOUR ARE IN ANY WAY WE CAN STILL UNCLEAR WHAT THE MAYOR
AREA WAS INTENDING TO DO A
ONE RECORD OUT THERE THE SALSA'S BACK SURE I'VE BEEN THERE
POISE SHE HAD INITIAL IS CERTAIN THAT THE MAN AND HE THAT
CARS OR
A PRIDE OF LAMP IT WAS OCCURRING IN WAS HOLLYWOOD AND THE POISE PROTRACTED THAT STATEMENT AND SAID THE SUSPECT NEVER
SO CURLY IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH UNCLEAR WHETHER HE WAS LOOKING TO YOU
A TRADE OF SOME EARTHLY A BALANCE ON HIS MIND ROBERT IN LOS ANGELES THANKS
TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN GORDON BROWN IS MAKING A SPEECH FOR THE REMAIN CAMP TODAY HE'LL SAY WE SHOULD LEAD RATHER THAN LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE AS POLITICAL EDITOR IS NORMAN SMITH MY TEENIES SENSE OF DESPERATION ON THE PART OF THE LOBE PARTED TRYING TO GET OUT THE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF HER REMAIN NORMAL JOHN I WOULD ONLY QUIBBLE WITH THE WORD TEENY THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF CONCERN BORDERING ON PANIC NOWHERE MORE SO ACTUALLY
THAN IN NUMBER TEN BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE CURIOUS PARADOXES OF THIS REFERENDUM THAT DAVID CAMERON'S POLITICAL FATE MAY REST IN THE HANDS OF ONE JEREMY CORBIN AND THE LABOUR PARTY THE LABOUR VOTE NOT COME UP FOR A MAIN THERE'S A WIDESPREAD VIEW MISTER CAMERON WE'LL LOSE AND SO OVER THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS WHAT WE WILL SEE IS ACTUALLY MISTER CAMERON SENIOR TORIES IN FAVOUR OF STAYING IN WILL TAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO STAND BACK FROM THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND ALLOW LABOUR TO TRY AND
DO WHAT THEY'VE NOT MANAGED TO DO SO FAR DOMINATE THE NEWS AGENDA AND TO REACH OUT TO LABOUR VOTERS THE SECOND THING WE DO GET TODAY IS A SORT OF RE PACKAGING I THINK OF THE LABOUR CAMPAIGN THE BRAKES OF PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT AS A RELAUNCH BUT ANYWAY THERE'S GOING TO BE A CONSCIOUS MOVE AWAY FROM PROJECT FEAR TO PROJECT HOPE SO GORDON BROWN WILL MAKE A SPEECH SETTING OUT HIS SORT OF POSITIVE FORWARD AGENDA FOR EUROPE TALKING ABOUT HOW CAN CREATE
HALF A MILLION NEW JOBS THROUGH COMPLETION OF THE SINGLE MARKET AND SERVICES AND ELSEWHERE HOW IT CAN DRIVE DOWN ENERGY PRICES BY A COMMON SHARED GRID IN THE Y. YOU CAN CRACK DOWN ON TAX AVOIDANCE AND HOW IT CAN PROVIDE MORE MONEY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION THE GREAT BIG DIFFICULTY WITH ALL THIS JOHN VERY OBVIOUSLY IS IT IS LATE VERY
VERY LATE AND IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS YOU NEED WEEKS YOU NEED MONTHS TO GET YOUR MESSAGE OVER AND THE IDEA OF TRYING TO THRASH IT TOGETHER IN THE LAST TEN DAYS ANYTHING EDGED UNDERLINES HOW NERVOUS AND UNEASY LABOUR FOLK ART IF IMMIGRATION IS THE BIG ISSUE AS WE SPEAK AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE OPINION POLLS ANYWAY TELL US THAT IT IS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE MY BROWN SAYING WELL WE WILL MITIGATE ITS AFFECTS MAY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR
INDEED I MEAN IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS THAT THERE IS A BROADER PROBLEM THIS JOHN IN THAT
LABOUR BASICALLY DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN THESE LAST TEN DAYS BECAUSE IT'S TOO LATE TO CHANGE OPINIONS ON IT BY TALKING ABOUT IT YOU SIMPLY MAKE IT THE ISSUE AND PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF THE BRAKES AT CAMPAIGN THE OTHER THING WHICH I THINK IS CAUSING A REAL ANXIETY IN SOME SECTIONS OF THE LABOUR PARTY IS THAT SOMETHING MUCH MORE PROFOUND AS POTENTIALLY GOING ON HERE THAT THERE IS A DANGER OF A SCOTLAND MARK TO WIN SOME OF LABOUR'S TRADITIONAL HEARTLANDS OLD MANUFACTURING AREAS IN THE NORTH WHERE LABOUR FOLK
BLUNTLY BECOME DISENCHANTED WITH THE PARTY WHICH THEY VIEWERS TO MIDDLE CLASS TO SOUTHERN TOO OUT OF TOUCH WITH WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN IMMIGRATION HAS BECOME SORT OF A LIGHTNING ROD FOR THAT THE KEY ISSUE WHICH PEOPLE RALLY AROUND AND SIMPLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE ABOUT AND IN THAT CONTEXT SIMPLY GETTING A FEW HEADLINES GETTING MY BROWN THAT
PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO TURN THIS AROUND PARTICULARLY OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE LEADING FIGURES THE MOST POWERFUL FIGURES IN THE LABOUR PARTY AS WE SPEAK ARE IN FAVOUR OF IMMIGRATION
WELL I MEAN TRUE I THINK MORE CONCERNING ALMOST IS THE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM
WHICH WE KNOW OF MISTER CORBIN FOR THE E.U. AND ALTHOUGH HE HAS BEEN IN A FRENETIC TRAVELLING UP AND DOWN THE COUNTRY
BY AND LARGE IT HAS BEEN MEETING HIS PEOPLE PEOPLE WE WANT SELFIES WITH SHOUTING JAZZ WE CAN AND ALL THAT HE HASN'T MANAGED TO GET BEYOND HIS OWN PEOPLE AND CRUCIALLY HE HAS NOT MANAGED TO GET ON THE NEWS BULLETINS AND ALTHOUGH
I THINK MISTER CORBIN HAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISTRUST AND DISLIKE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THE BLUNT TRUTH IS IF YOU WANT TO REACH A BIG AUDIENCE YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA THERE IS NO WAY AROUND THAT AND TO DATE HE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DO THAT
WE GET MY BROWN OUT TODAY WE GET HILARY BENN OUT TODAY AS WELL MAYBE THE HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL BE MORE ADEPT A DOMINATING A NEWS AGENDA THAT'S WILL BE TALKING TO MY WE HOPE ANYWAY AT TWENTY PAST EIGHT EIGHTY MINUTES TO SEVEN THE TIME NOW AND LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND DESPERATE MESSAGES FROM PEOPLE INSIDE THE CLUB IN ORLANDO ATTACKED BY A GUNMAN MAKE HARROWING READING QUITE A FEW OF THEM THE SUN IS AMONG THEM
AMONG THE PAPERS REPRODUCING TEXTS SENT BY A THIRTY YEAR OLD MAN EDDIE JUSTICE TO HIS MOTHER MEENA AS HE HIDES IN THE CLUB'S TOILETS HE WRITES MUMMY I LOVE YOU IN CLUB THEY'RE SHOOTING LATER HE'S COMING I'M GOING TO DIE AND FINALLY HE HAS US AND HE'S IN HERE WITH US HIS MOTHER DID NOT HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN
THE SHOOTINGS PROMPT THE PAPERS TO REFLECT ON AMERICA'S GUN LAWS HAS THE GUARDIAN SAYS AMERICAN SOCIETY IS VULNERABLE TO SUCH ATTACKS IN A WAY THAT OTHERS ARE NOT BECAUSE OF ITS BELIEF IN EASY WIDESPREAD ACCESS TO LETHAL WEAPONS
THE MIRROR SAYS RESTRICTING GUN OWNERSHIP MAY NOT HAVE STOPPED THE GUNMAN NO MAMA TEAM BUT AMERICA MUST CONFRONT THE FACT THAT A CULTURE OF WEAPONS MAKES IT EASIER TO MURDER AND MAIM THEIR EMAIL IS SCATHING ABOUT LEAKS REPORTED YESTERDAY REVEALING THAT DIPLOMATS DISCUSSED ALLOWING ONE AND A HALF MILLION TURKISH SPECIAL PASSPORT HOLDERS VISA FREE ACCESS TO BRITAIN SUGGESTING THE CONSIDERATION OF CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IS BEING DELAYED UNTIL AFTER
THE REFERENDUM ON U.K. MEMBERSHIP NEXT WEEK WHAT ELSE IS THE E.U. ELITE HIDING FROM US ASKED THE PAPER IT CONCLUDES WHAT A CONTEMPTUOUS WAY TO TREAT A VOTERS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THAT VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR TURKISH NATIONALS WILL NOT BE CHAINED
MANY MANY MANY COLOURFUL PICTURES OF THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AMONG THEM THE TELEGRAPH BEEN ANALYSING HER ADDRESS TO THE CROWDS IN THE MAIL AND THINKS IT MAY HAVE DETECTED THE MESSAGE SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT SAYS HER MAJESTY SPOKE OF THE MANY BENEFITS THAT CAN FLOW WHEN PEOPLE COME TOGETHER FOR A COMMON PURPOSE AS FAMILY FRIENDS OR NEIGHBOURS IT IS HARD SAYS THE PAPER NOT TO SEE THOSE WORDS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM NEXT WEEK THOUGH IT IS ALSO EASY TO SEE
ANY SUCH CONNOTATION CAN BE DENIED IT BELIEVES THE QUEEN MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SENDING A SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE ABOUT HER GOVERNMENT'S PREFERENCE FOR THE OUTCOME OF JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THE DAILY MAIL REPORTER CALLS AN ALMIGHTY ROW WITHIN THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE ABOUT HER PERFORMANCE OF RULE BRITANNIA AND LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY AT THE END OF THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL MEETING IN BRIGHTON THE ORGANISERS ARE DECIDED ON AT THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY BY RECREATING THE LAST NIGHT OF THE PROMS HAVE THOUSANDS OF DELICATE SINGING AND WAVING UNION FLAGS MEMBERS THEY REFUSED TO JOIN IN
OTHERS HAVE ACCUSED THE ORGANISATION OF RACISM JINGOISM ELITISM COLONIALISM W.I. SAID IT AIMS TO BE INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING TO WOMEN OF ALL BACKGROUNDS OF A TIME AS THE MALE THE TELEGRAPH OR REPORT A GOAL FOR THE HUNTING INSTINCT OF CATS TO BE BRED OUT OF THEM EVERY YEAR BRITAIN'S DOMESTIC CATS ARE POLITICAL TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION SMALL CREATURES INCLUDING FIFTY FIVE MILLION BIRDS OR CATS OR BEHAVIOUR EXPERT FROM BRISTOL UNIVERSITY JOHN BRADSHAW
AS THE PLANETS GETS MORE CROWDED THIS IS NOT AN ANIMAL THAT CAN COEXIST WITH WILDLIFE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SAYS THE TIME YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CATS CONFUSION FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN PRIZED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO HUNT YET FEW OWNERS TODAY SHOW ANY GRATITUDE WHEN THEY'RE WOKEN AT THREE A.M. TO A CRIPPLED SPARROW BEING DROPPED ON TO VERY OH DEAR
IT IS STILL ONLY EVER IT COOKS AT THE SEVEN MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING THE GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIFTY PEOPLE IN A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED THREE TIMES BY THE F.B.I. ON SUSPICION OF LINKS TO HIS LIMITS MILITANTS BUT OFFICIALS DECIDED TO TAKE NO ACTION NOW AND DAVID CAMERON CLAIMED HER RECENTLY THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT BE HAPPY ABOUT HAVE BRECHT'S IT THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN LONDON COMPLAINED THAT MOSCOW BEEN DRAGGED INTO A DOMESTIC MATTER ON WHICH I HAD NO OPINION BUT IS THAT REALLY THE CASE I'M OSCAR CORRESPONDENT STEVEN ROSENBERG
NEXT WEEK GOT THE BRITISH PUBLIC WILL BE ANSWERING ONE SIMPLE QUESTION SIT WITH THAT SHOULD THE U.K. STATE IN THE E.U.
IT'S BRITISH VOTERS OF COURSE WILL BE CALLING THE TUNE BUT RECENTLY A STRING OF WORLD LEADERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
SINGLE NOT THERE'S BEEN A CHORUS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMENT CLAIMING OF WRECKS IT WOULD LEAVE BRITAIN FACING THE MUSIC
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID AS MUCH THE UNITED KINGDOM
LESS INFLUENCE IN EUROPE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE LESS INFLUENCE GLOBALLY AND HERE'S DONALD TUSK PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DO THEY THAT KING IF YOU'RE A FRIEND YOU UP THE NIGHT THAT KING
BUT WHAT DOES PRESIDENT PUTIN BEEN SAY ABOUT REX
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND YET RUSSIA HAS BECOME PART OF THE BRECHT SAID TO BLEAT
WHO'S THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND THE ONLY COUNTRY IF THE TRUTH IS TOLD THAT WOULD LIKE US TO LEAVE THE IT'S RUSSIA
AND THAT SHOULD PROBABLY TELL US ALL THAT WE NEED TO TALK LIKE THAT LEAVES RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ROLLING THEIR EYES MARIA'S A CORONER IS SPOKESPERSON FOR THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY RASHES BLAMED EVERYTHING NOT ONLY IN U.K. BED ALL THE WAY THERE WERE
IT'S NOT SURPRISING FOR US BIRDS RUSSIA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BREAKS IT AT ALL
WHERE MARTIN WALKED IN THIS PROCESS WE HAVE NO INTERESTS IN THIS FIELD NOT INVOLVED SHE SAYS WELL THAT'S TRUE IT'S NOT RUSSIAN VOTERS WILL BE DECIDING WHETHER BRITAIN IS IN OR OUT OF THE E.U.
BUT NO INTERESTS IN THIS FIELD THAT'S DEBATABLE IF THERE'S A PRACTICE THAT IF THERE ARE CRATERS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION OF COURSE THIS WILL BE OUR LOCAL PROPAGANDA VICTORY PROFESSOR SO GAME HE'D VEGGIE FROM MOSCOW'S HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS BELIEVES THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS KEEPING HIS PRESIDENTIAL FINGERS CROSSED FOR VOTES LEAF AND THAT THE KREMLIN ZE CALCULATION IS A SIMPLE ONE
REX IT EQUALS A WEAKER E.U. WHICH EQUALS A STRONGER RUSSIA MUST COURSE IS EVERYTHING AS AS THERE ARE SOME GAME
WHAT'S BAD FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION AS GOOD FOR RUSSIA AS JUST A SIMPLE AS THAT I MEAN THEY DON'T THINK FOR THAT YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS THE BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER IS THAT THERE IS AND ALL THE QUESTION OF FREE TRAVEL AND ALL BIGGER TRANSACTION COSTS FOR THE RUSSIAN BUSINESS NOW THEY DON'T THINK I'M THIS WAY IT'S EITHER OR IT'S ALSO DIVIDE AND CONQUER
LAST MONTH'S VLADIMIR PUTIN VISITED GREECE
THE KREMLIN HAS BEEN CULTIVATING TIES WITH THE NUMBER OF E.U. STATES INCLUDING AUSTRIA HUNGARY AND SLOVAKIA
TO BREAK THE EUROPEAN UNION'S UNANIMITY OVER SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA
SOME WESTERN GOVERNMENTS ALSO ACCUSED THE KREMLIN OR TRYING TO SOW DISCORD IN THE E.U. BY SUPPORTING EVEN FUNDING SOME NATIONALIST PARTIES IN EUROPE BUT WOULD A WEAKER EUROPEAN UNION REALLY BE IN RUSSIA'S INTEREST
THE PIANO IS A FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST OR RUSSIA HAS NO BIG REASON TO BE VARIOUS BULBS EROSION AND CRISIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS HERE EXACTLY AS A MANIFESTATION OF EUROPE A RASHER BY DEFAULT GORDON NOT IMPORTANT ROLE
FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT SUGGEST THAT RUSSIA WOULD LIKE TO SEE BRITAIN LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TO TEAR UP THE CURRENT EUROPEAN STRUCTURES AND START AGAIN RUSSIA WILL NOT CRY VERY MY SHIFTY EUROPEAN YOU AND YOU WILL BE IN DEEP OF THE CLIMB BUT TO BE HONEST WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A BIG EFFORTS BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS IN THE VERY DEEP
YOU WIN
BUT THE KREMLIN COULD CHANGE ITS TUNE ABOUT EUROPE IF EUROPE CHANGED ITS POSITION ON RUSSIA
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS E.U. MEMBER STATES MUST AGREE WHETHER OR NOT TO PROLONG SANCTIONS AGAINST MOSCOW IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO THAT REALLY WOULD BE MUSIC TO THE KREMLIN ZE YES
EVA ROSENBERG REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS TEN TO SEVEN EVERY PROFESSIONAL SEEMS TO BE STATING HIS VIEWS ON THE BRICKS HAD TO BE SCIENCE AND RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENTS NO EXCEPTION OF COURSE ALSO AS EDITOR TOM FILLED AND IN THE CENTRE OF CAMBRIDGE THIS MORNING FAMOUS BUT ITS TECHNICAL PROWESS TANKING THINK TOLMAN AND SCIENTIFIC SAMPLE OF VIEWS I TAKE IF YOU HAVE THAT BUT MY TEN PER CENT OF THE POPULATION OF THEM DIVIDED BY THREE OR SOMETHING
IT'S AN ANECDOTAL SURVEY WE'VE BEEN DEAR HEY I LIKE THAT
GOOD MORNING FROM OUTSIDE SENATE HOUSE RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF CAMBRIDGE THE CITY OF COURSE THAT IS FAMOUS FOR ITS SCIENTIFIC PROWESS I MEAN GOING BACK IN HISTORY ARE LOOKING HERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLACE WHERE THE LUCASIAN PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS WAS ISAAC NEWTON NOT SO LONG AGO IT WAS STEPHEN HAWKING
ACROSS THE RIVER FROM HERE THERE'S THE CAVENDISH LABORATORY VERY FAMOUS INSTITUTE AND OF COURSE THE EAGLE PUB JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY FROM WHERE I'M STANDING NOW THAT'S WHERE FRANCIS CRICK FAMOUSLY BURSTIN TO TELL HIS COLLEAGUE JAMES WATSON THAT THEY HAD DONE IT THEY'D FOUND THE SECRET OF LIFE THE STRUCTURE OF D.N.A.
VERY PROUD HISTORY AND IT HAS TO BE SAID ARE PRETTY UNIVERSAL ENDORSEMENT OF REMAIN FROM THE DONS DAMES KNIGHTS AND NOBLE LAUREATES OF CAMBRIDGE WORKING HERE TODAY BUT NOT EVERYONE IS SO ENAMOURED OF THE E.U. WITH ME IS MARTIN KEEGAN FROM THE CAMBRIDGE BREAKS IT CAMPAIGN MARTIN YOU ARE IN A BIT OF A MINORITY HERE IN THE CITY
MORNING TOM I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE TO SAY THAT BUT YOU CAME IT WAS A GLOBAL UNIVERSITY NOT A EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY AND WE THINK THAT E.U. MEMBERSHIP IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY COST FOR CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY'S VERY STRONG WE'VE GOT
FIVE OF THE TOP TWENTY UNIVERSITIES IN THE WORLD THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY WITHOUT US WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT BECOMING ISOLATED IF WE IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'RE TAKING THE UNIVERSITIES WITH US IF WE
THE ARGUMENT THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY BUT THERE ARE TWO REALLY ON THERE THE FIRST IS ABOUT THE MONEY WE'RE WEAK WE GET OUT MORE THAN WE PAID AND THE SECOND OF THIS THIS IDEA ABOUT COLLABORATION ISN'T IT THE WORKING TOGETHER
IN THE MODERN ERA OF SCIENCE IN THE DAYS OF OF THE MAVERICK LONE GENIUS ARE LONG GONE IT'S ALL ABOUT COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS
AND THAT THE PLACE TO START IS AT HOME AND NEAR TO ATTRACT THE BEST BRAINS FROM AROUND EUROPE AND THE WORLD TO COME HERE TO CAMBRIDGE TO MAKE IT SUCH A GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL UNIVERSITY SAID
WELL WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE ATTRACTING TALENT FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD AS YOU SAY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES THEY WANT TO ARTS OF THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IN TERMS OF MONEY AND ALSO ABOUT COLLABORATION AND THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN BIDDING ON PROJECTS ON THE FRAMEWORK FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME A RISE TWENTY TWENTY IS IT NOW CALLED
YEAH WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO GET LOTS OF DIFFERENT COLLABORATORS FROM AROUND THE E.U. WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT BUREAUCRATIC CERTAINLY THE AUSTRIAN FORTUNES FOR ROOMS SHUTTERS TO CRITICISE THE BUREAUCRACY OF HAVEN'T HAD ALL THESE PARTNERS ON EUROPEAN PROJECTS BUT
J.J. THOMSON DISCOVERED ELECTRON JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND HE WAS SEVENTY YEARS BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE USEFUL FOR ECONOMICALLY END SO IT'S HARD TO ASSESS
THE VALUE OF RESEARCH WHILE IT'S BEING DONE AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE OUTPUTS THAT COME FOR RESEARCH NOT JUST HOW MUCH MONEY GOES INTO IT WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MONEY FROM THE E.U. AND WILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN EUROPE WIDE RESEARCH AND IT WAS AND GLOBAL NETWORKS IN THE FUTURE
MARTIN FROM US HERE IN CAMBRIDGE WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE VICE CHANCELLOR OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY LATER IN THE PROGRAMME BUT FOR NOW IT'S BACK TO THE STUDIO THANKS A NOT TOM SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN RUSSIA'S IN BIG TROUBLE AT THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP THERE FACING DISCIPLINARY ACTION BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF FANS ARE ATTACKED THE ENGLISH FANS AFTER THE GAME ON SATURDAY BUT BOTH RUSSIA AND ENGLAND ARE BEING WARNED THAT THEY COULD BE KICKED OUT OF THE COMPETITION
IF THERE IS MORE VIOLENCE LET'S TALK TO US WHAT'S CROSSWIRE DOWN DOWN RHONA'S IN CHANTILLY THIS MORNING THE WHAT WONDER WHAT MEASURES ARE BEING TAKEN TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN
THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAVE GOT INVOLVED NOW SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEND OVER INFORM FORCE MONTHS MORE POLICE PERSONNEL TO TRY AND HELP THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES WHO OF COURSE ALREADY STRETCHED GIVEN THE TERROR THREAT HERE IN FRANCE THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES I THINK THAT THE ORGANISERS FACE THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO EXTEND THAT ALCOHOL BAND THAT'S BEEN APPLYING IN SOME INSTANCES THE ENGLAND AGAINST WALES MATCH FOR EXAMPLE IN LAWNS ON THURSDAY WAS ALREADY SUBJECT TO THAT BUT THAT ALCOHOL BAN AROUND MATCH VENUES IS NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO
THE WHOLE TOURNAMENT ENGLAND ABOUT BACK HERE AND CHANGE THEIR RATHER TRANQUIL TRAINING BASE WHICH IS A STARK CONTRAST TO WHAT HAPPENED IN MARSEILLES OF COURSE TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THAT MATCH MAY DO SO NOW KNOWING THAT THE THREAT OF EXPULSION
HANGS OVER THEM AND IT WOULD BE AN UNPRECEDENTED MEASURE TAKEN BY UEFA IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL MAJOR COMPETITIONS ARE THREATENING THEM WITH THIS BEFORE OF COURSE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN THERE WAS TROUBLE IN CHARLES WHILE IN A TOURNAMENT SIXTEEN YEARS AGO THEY NEVER ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH IT BUT IT WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE FOR THE F.A. THAT THE PROBLEM I THINK THE CONCERN THAT THE AUTHORITIES NOW HAVE
IS THE SCHEDULING AS THEY SAY THURSDAY IN LAWNS A SMALL TOWN BUT THE SMALLEST IN FACT IN THIS COMPETITION IS DUE TO HOST THIS BIG ENGLAND AGAINST WALES MATCH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO BRITISH FANS EXPECTED TO COME OVER THE CHANNEL FOR THAT MANY MANY OF THEM WILL BE STAYING IN NEARBY LEGAL A FEW MILES AWAY AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHERE WOULD YOU BELIEVE RUSSIA PLAY
THE PREVIOUS DAY SLOVAKIA AND RUSSIAN FANS AND HOOLIGANS WE UNDERSTAND ALREADY GATHERING IN LILLE AHEAD OF THAT IN THERE HAVING SEEN THREE DAYS OF VIOLENCE ON THE STREETS OF MARSEILLE THE CONCERT NOW OF COURSE WILL BE THERE COULD BE A REPEATEDLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS I DID IS IT SURELY THIS I RECKON DO COME IN NOT AT THE LAST MINUTE WHATEVER'S COME CHANGE THE VENUES THE MATCHES BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THE PLACES WHERE THE FANS ARE BEING SENT
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT I THINK SADLY BUT I THINK UEFA D'YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE OF THE BLAME HERE CLEARLY THE SCHEDULING
DOES LOOK VERY QUESTIONABLE WHY FOR EXAMPLE PLAY A MATCH THAT WAS COMBUSTIBLE AND IDENTIFIED AS A HIGH RISK FIXTURE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND RUSSIA IN MARSEILLES IN THE HEAT ON A SATURDAY EVENING IN A PLACE WHERE ENGLAND FANS THAT EXPERIENCE TROUBLE AND BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR TROUBLE IN THE PAST WHY IS THIS MATCH BEING PLAYED IN THE DAY AFTER RUSSIA PLAY IN LILLE THE SEGREGATION IN THE STADIUM IN MARSEILLES CLEARLY WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
THE SECURITY PERSONNEL UEFA ADMITTED WASN'T ADEQUATE AS I THINK CLEARLY THERE ARE QUESTIONS HERE FOR THE ORGANISERS THE FRENCH POLICING I THINK HAS BEEN CRITICISED HE WOULD AS I SAY THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES HAVE OTHER TROUBLES ON THEIR ON THEIR HANDS INCLUDING OF COURSE THE TERROR THE TERROR THREAT THAT WE KNOW ABOUT DAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE TOLD HER FORMER BOSS OF THE F.A. AT SEVEN THIRTY
TIME FOR THE WEATHER FORECAST PHIL JOHN ANY GRATEFUL GARDENERS OUT THERE AFTER THE ROOM WELL YES NO NO CAUSE FOR IRRIGATION AT THE MOMENT FOR SURE A NATION WILL KEEP IT COMING OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS WELL AND SPEAKING OF SUCH THINGS LET'S START THE SOUTH WEST ENGLAND THE SOUTH AND WEST MIDLANDS WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND WHERE THE FRONT ALREADY MOVING IN FROM THE ATLANTIC MORE RAIN
IT WILL EVENTUALLY PASS THROUGH BUT ONLY LEAVING THE PROSPECT OF A LITTLE BIT OF BRIGHTNESS PERHAPS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AFTERNOON BUT THAT MAY IN ITS OWN RIGHT TRIGGER OFF SOME PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS SLOW MOVING AT THAT ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN IRELAND COULD BE SOME PROBLEMS HERE TEMPERATURE IN THEIR TEENS OR SO IT'S MOVING A BIT FURTHER NORTH SOUTH WEST SCOTLAND NORTH WEST ENGLAND THE NORTH AND EAST MIDLANDS AND THE EAST ANGLIA AREA AND THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND ARE PRETTY MISERABLE FAIR AT THE MOMENT WATCH OUT FOR SOME FOG IN THE VALE OF YORK TYPE HER NECK OF THE WOODS
AND HERE YOU ACQUIRE THAT WEATHER FRONTS AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON IT MAY BECOME THE FOCUS OF SOME HEFTY SLOW MOVING SHOWERS AND AGAIN THERE ARE SOME WARNINGS ABOUT THESE BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT DAYS IF YOU REALLY COP ONE FOR A WHILE YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AGAIN THE TEMPERATURES MID TO UPPER TEENS SOMETHING OF THAT ORDER NORTH EAST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST SCOTLAND MISERABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT'S WET AT THE MOMENT THAT FOG OR BANDS AND THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO STAIN TO TEMPT HER LOCKS AT AROUND TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DEGREES
FOR THE NORTH WEST OF SCOTLAND CLOUDY FARE HERE MAYBE THE ODD SHOWER WE END ON A DRY FINE AND SUNNY NOTE WITH THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND AND THE NORTHERN ISLES TO HEAR IN THE TEENS WITH SOME SUNSHINE THE THIS WEEK ON RADIO FOUR WITH DRAMA THAT TAKES US INTO THE COURTROOM

LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JOHN HUMPHRYS AND JUSTIN WEBB
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE THIRTEENTH OF JUNE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE F.B.I. SAYS THE GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIFTY PEOPLE IN A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED THREE TIMES ON SUSPICION OF LINKS TO TERRORISM BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
GORDON BROWN WILL URGE LABOUR SUPPORTERS TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TELLING THEM THEY HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP AND A PRESSURE GROUP CONCERNED ABOUT POPULATION GROWTH IS FORECASTING THAT NET MIGRATION WILL EXCEED A QUARTER OF A MILLION EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF THE U.K. STAYS IN THE E.U. THE B.B.C. NEWS READ BY KRYSTLE
THE F.B.I. HAS SAID THE GUNMAN WHO SHOT DEAD FIFTY PEOPLE AT A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA WAS INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE TERRORISM LINKS BUT OFFICIALS CONCLUDED HE DIDN'T POSE A THREAT OBAMA TEAM CARRIED OUT THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN MODERN U.S. HISTORY IN THE EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY MORNING HE'D BEEN INTERVIEWED ON THREE OCCASIONS BY THE F.B.I. ABOUT HIS ALLEGED TIES TO TERRORISTS
BUT WHEN THE FINAL INVESTIGATION WAS DROPPED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AGENTS DECIDED NOT TO PLACE HIM ON A TERRORISM WATCH LIST A CORRESPONDENT TO LEE MCDOWELL REPORTS FROM ORLANDO
AS THE DEPRESSING LIST OF VICTIMS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED GETS LONGER MORE DETAILS ARE EMERGING OF THE MAN WHO SHOT THEM DEAD AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB OH MUM HAD SEEN THE TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD U.S. CITIZEN OF AFGHAN ORIGIN CALLED NINE ONE ONE BEFORE THE ATTACK DECLARING HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE HEAD OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
HE ENTERED THE CLUB AT ABOUT TWO A.M. FIRING IT WILL WITH TWO WEAPONS A HANDGUN AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HAVE BOTH BEEN BOUGHT WITHIN THE LAST WEEK IT'S LED TO RENEWED CALLS AMONG SOME FOR BETTER GUN CONTROL MEASURES IN AMERICA BUT OTHERS LIKE FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAYING THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER
YOU SIGN EUROPE IN THEIR PARENTS' ATTACKS WHERE THESE GUNS ARE STILL VERY MUCH
THE BOTTOM FROM THE BLACK MARKET THIS TERRACE YOU COMMITTED PEOPLE SO I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS LESS ON THE WEAPON THEY USED THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT WHICH IS A RADICAL INTERPRETATION
THE F.B.I. SAID HE'D INTERVIEWED OMAN THE TEAM ON THREE OCCASIONS BUT DECIDED ANY LINKS TO MILITANT ISLAM WITH TENUOUS MANY ARE NOW ASKING WHETHER MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT SUCH A HORRIFIC ATTACK
PRESIDENT OBAMA DESCRIBED THE ATTACK AS AN ACT OF TERROR AND HATE BUT THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR HIS COMMENTS ABOUT THE KILLINGS AS NICK BRYANT REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON
DECLARING THAT AMERICA COULD NOT AFFORD TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT ANY MORE DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE LAMBO MASSACRE BY CALLING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO RESIGN FOR NOT USING THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTACK AND LAMBASTING HILLARY CLINTON CLAIMING SHE WANTED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE IMMIGRATION FROM THE MIDDLE EAST BRINGING IN MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DURING HER FIRST TERM
BOTH THE TIMING AND TONE OF HIS COMMENTS ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT HE THANKS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR CONGRATULATIONS ABOUT BEING WRITERS HE PUT IT A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM HAVE BROUGHT AN ACID SHOWER OF CRITICISM FROM OPPONENTS
A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CALLED THE BILLIONAIRE A NARCISSISTIC MAN BABY WHO TURNED A NATIONAL TRAGEDY INTO A MOMENT OF SELF CONGRATULATION BUT DONALD TRUMP AS SEVE REPEATEDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE ATTACKS ON PARIS SAN BERNARDINO AND BRUSSELS THAT IS UNCOMPROMISING REMARKS PARTLY EXPLAIN HIS UNEXPECTED POLITICAL SUCCESS
POLICE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ARRESTED A HEAVILY ARMED MAN WHO SAID HE WAS PLANNING TO ATTEND THE GAY PRIDE MARCH IN LOS ANGELES IS NOT THOUGHT TO BE LINKED TO THE SHOOTINGS IN ORLANDO
GORDON BROWN WILL TAKE CENTRE STAGE IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN TODAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE LABOUR SUPPORTERS TO VOTE TO REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN A SPEECH IN LEICESTER HE'LL SAY THE Y. YOU CAN DELIVER POLICIES CLOSE TO LABOUR VOTERS HEARTS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER IS BEGINNING A WEEK OF INTENSE ACTIVITY BY LABOUR FIGURES WITH SENIOR CONSERVATIVES TAKING A LOWER PROFILE HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL TEMPORARILY DEPART TO THEIR CAMPAIGN STAGE AND MAKE WAY FOR HIS PREDECESSOR AT NUMBER TEN GORDON BROWN WILL MAKE WHAT HE'S CALLING THE POSITIVE CASE FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. INCLUDING ACTION WITH OTHER MEMBER STATES TO CREATE JOBS HELPED ENVIRONMENT
AND CLAMP DOWN ON CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE THE CHANGE OF TONE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE LABOUR SOURCES SAY THEIR OWN FOCUS GROUPS WERE SUGGESTING THAT PROJECT FEAR WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING PROJECT FAILURE
EMPHASISE THE EXTENT OF LABOUR UNITY AND Y. YOU THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MY BROWN SHARING A PLATFORM IN THE CLOSING DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH A SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL THE MAN WHO TRIED TO CHALLENGE HIM FOR THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP NEARLY A DECADE AGO
BUT THE LABOUR M.P. GIVES THE STUART THE CHEERS THE OFFICIAL LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAID HER PARTY'S VOTERS HAD MOST SEEN THROUGH GOVERNMENT SPIN AND NO AMOUNT OF HISTORY COBBLED TOGETHER RELAUNCHES WE'D CHANGE THAT
A STUDY BY A GROUP WHICH ONCE LOWER IMMIGRATION HAS FORECAST THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN IN THE Y. U. NET MIGRATION WILL RUN MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION A YEAR FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS A REPORT BY MIGRATION WATCH SAYS THERE'S WIDESPREAD COMPLACENCY AND DENIAL ABOUT BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE IMPACT OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH IS ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
TODAY'S REPORT PAINTS A PICTURE OF CONTINUING HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION FOR A GENERATION TO COME UNDER A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO THE THINK TANK WHICH CAMPAIGNS FOR TIGHTER IMMIGRATION CONTROLS CALCULATES IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME NET MIGRATION COULD STILL BE ALMOST AS HIGH AS IT IS TODAY AT AROUND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR HOWEVER IF TURKEY IS ALLOWED TO JOIN THE E.U. THEN AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TURKS COULD ARRIVE EACH YEAR
THE REPORT HAS BEEN SEIZED ON BY BRACK'S AT SUPPORTERS TO BUTTRESS THEIR CLAIM THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NET MIGRATION SO LONG AS BRITAIN REMAINS IN THE E.U. REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS INSIST BENEFIT CURBS ON E.U. MIGRANTS AND HER RECOVERY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES WILL GRADUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBERS AND YESTERDAY THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF TURKEY JOINING UNTIL THE YEAR THREE THOUSAND
THE CONCERN OF THE REMAIN CAMP THOUGH WILL BE THAT THIS REPORT AGAIN FOCUSES ATTENTION ON AN ISSUE THEY AREN'T DESPERATE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DOMINATE THE FINAL STAGES OF THIS REFERENDUM

MAKE HER STRONGER COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF THIS THROUGH LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING WE ALL KNOW THAT LOVE TRUMPS AND AN ATTACK LIKE THIS AGAINST THE L.G.B.T. CUE COMMUNITY AGAINST THE END OR COMMUNE AS ATTACK AGAINST ALL
THAT REPORT FROM BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN FOR FLORIDA LEWIS FRANKEL'S HE TOLD ME THAT SHE UNDERSTANDS THE BEMUSEMENT THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD FIELDS WITH AMERICA'S LIBERAL GUN CONTROL LAWS
I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR WE HAD THIRTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS DUE TO FIREARMS AND WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF YOU
MURDERS THIS ONE LAST NIGHT AND I'LL BE THE BIGGEST ONE IN HISTORY AND WE DO HAVE ALLOWED UNDER A SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS MANY OF US WERE ARGUE THAT IT DOES NOT PROTECT THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO POSSESS HIGH POWERED SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPON MARIE THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD NOW
BACKGROUND CHECKS THEN SHELLS IT IS THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWS THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND THAT IT PEOPLE SAY WILL THERE'LL BE ART IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THEREFORE THAT IT PEOPLE DON'T SAY BUT THE CONSTITUTION CAN BE CHANGED HAS BEEN CHANGE MANY MANY TIMES OVER THE CENTURIES
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THEY CUT HER TUITION CHANGE ANY TIME SOON BUT WHAT WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS PEREZ STRICTER GUN WAS I MEAN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE COW IS SEND STATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DO I'M HERE IN FLORIDA WHERE I'VE SEEN OUR STATE LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTE GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THEY HAVE TRIED TO PASS LAWS IN LET'S HAVE PASSED LAWS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO CARRY GUNS OPENLY AREN'T YOU BARRY
VERY EASY TO GET A FIREARM IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA SO WE SEE IN STAYED AFTER STATE LEGISLATURES GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION BUT EVEN WITH OUR SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH GIVES THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND SUPREME COURT WHICH IS OUR HIGHEST COURT HAS CLEARLY SAID
THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY PROMISE A BOX AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE CAN STILL DO TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY MUCH SAFER BUT THIS TERRIBLE ATTACK IN FLORIDA REALLY ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING IS IT
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW WILL BE BACK AND US WE WERE HAVING MOMENTS OF SILENCE AND THEN WHEN I EXPECT HE'S THE CONGRESS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE SILENT
AND THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE IT'S A LOT OF PRAYERS AND NOT ANY ACTION AND YOUR REACTION TO THAT IS WHAT DISGUST
DESPAIR NO DISCUSSED I THINK IT'S LACK OF COURAGE AND I THINK IT'S A LACK AND DUDEY BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME UP
OH NO I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP LISTEN THERE'S MANY OF US WHO WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY FOR BETTER ALLIES SIR TO PROTECT PEOPLE
THERE IT'LL BE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BECAUSE WE HAVE LED TO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WITH ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE POINTS OF VIEW ON THIS ISSUE CONGRESSWOMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN BOSSES PAY CONTINUES TO BE A HOT TOPIC BIG CITY INVESTOR UNHAPPY WITH THE PALE OF A HOUSE BUILDER PERSIMMON DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS THE DETAILS
THANKS PERSIMMON HAS ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST HOUSE BUILDERS AND IS THE LATEST COMPANY TO FACE CRITICISM OVER EXECUTIVE PAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE HAD SET UP A TEN YEAR SCHEME THAT LOOKS SET TO PAY OUT HANDSOMELY THE TOP ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MANAGERS COULD CHEER SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BUT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN MINE FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS
BUT SOME SHAREHOLDERS ARE NOT HAPPY ONE BIG FUND MANAGER ROYAL LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT VOTED AGAINST THE SCHEME EDITS INCEPTION AND HAS VOTED AGAINST THAT EVERY YEAR SINCE I ASKED MIKE FOX ROYAL LONDON'S HIT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DEAL WORKS
THERE ARE CERTAIN PARAMETERS THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN FAKES WHICH HIS SHARE PRICE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO GIVE A PRECISE AMOUNT HOWEVER IN THEORY THE MAXIMUM AWARD TO THE HUNDRED FORTY COULD BE UP TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF WHICH AS HE COULD GET UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF THAT IT COULD BE MORE THOUGH COULDN'T IT PERSIMMON SHARES DO REALLY WELL THEY COULD GET EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
THAT'S CORRECT AND I THINK IT'S ONE IMPORTANT POINT TO SAY HERE IS THAT PERSIMMON SHARES HAVE DONE VERY WELL SO WE'RE NOT HERE TALKING ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCES BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH EFFECTIVELY IN TERMS OF REWARD
WHY THEN HAS ROYAL LONDON VOTED AGAINST THIS THIS PAY SCHEME BOTH EDITS INCEPTION EVERY YEAR SINCE IF IT ALIGNS MANAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS ISN'T THAT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHEN WE DID FACE AGAINST IT WE DID FEEL THAT THE LEVEL
OF REWARD WAS TOO HIGH TO GIVE AWAY TEN PER CENT OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS SHAREHOLDERS IS TO OUR DETRIMENT WE FELT ALMOST IN UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WAS TOO HIGH AND VERY UNUSUAL WHICH IS WHY WE VOTED AGAINST IT THE FACT THAT THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WEEK YOU'LL BE FULLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE REWARDED BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE WITHIN SENSIBLE PARAMETERS
IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT YOU WERE IN A MINORITY BOTH IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY OTHER SHARES HOLDERS HAVE SUPPORT THE SCHEME WE WERE IN A VERY SMALL MINORITY IN TWENTY TWELVE I THINK ONLY TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT VOTED AGAINST THE SCHEME BUT THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR REASONS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY
BUSINESSES PARA PERFORMED ANYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS AND SO YOU WERE VOTING ON THIS IN TWENTY TWELVE IT'S UNLIKELY YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THE SCALE OF THE SAID THAT AN HOUR COMING ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT A FUTURE FOR THIS KIND OF SCHEME DO YOU THINK OTHER COMPANIES WILL HAVE LEARNT
THAT PERHAPS SOMETIMES THEY NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL AND PERHAPS SHOULD EXERCISE SOME DISCRETION EVEN AFTER THE THE THE OUTLINE OF THE AWARD IS ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A KEY THEME
FOR CORPORATES RECENTLY IN THE REMUNERATION WORLD WHICH IS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF COMPANIES WHO IN THEORY SHOULD HAVE AWARDED A CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF MONEY BUT IN REALITY SHE HAD A QUESTION WHETHER THAT WAS REASONABLE IF WE TAKE THE HOUSING INDUSTRY WHERE THIS PERCEIVED TO BE A HOUSING SHORTAGE WHEN WHICH IS CAUSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS IF YOU TAKE THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE HOUSING MARKET TO TRY AND RESOLVE THAT I THINK ANY BOARD
AND OPERATE GET OUT OPERATING A HOUSING COMPANY SHOULD ASK ITSELF THE WISDOM HAD MAKING AN AWARD OF THIS SCALE IN THAT CONTEXT HE EVEN IF THEORETICALLY THAT AWARD IS JUSTIFIABLE WE WOULD EXPECT THE BOARD OF HOUSEBUILDING COMPANY TO ASK ITSELF THE WISDOM OF MAKING SUCH BIG AWARDS IN THAT CONTEXT
THAT WAS THAT WAS MIKE FOX WERE LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT'S HIT OF SUSTAINABLE THE BASEMENT WE ASKED PERSIMMON IF THEY WANTED TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME THEY DIDN'T BUT THEY GAVE US A STATEMENT DEFENDING THE SCHEME THE COMPANY SAYS IT WAS DESIGNED TO PAY UP ONLY WHEN SHAREHOLDERS DID WELL AND THAT SINCE IT WAS PUT IN PLACE PERSIMMON HAS DELIVERED A FIFTY SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN NEW HOMES COMPLETED INVESTED OVER TWO BILLION POUNDS A NEW LAND
AND RETURN TO ONE BILLION POUNDS TO SHAREHOLDERS DOMINIC THANK YOU TWENTY PAST SEVEN SHOULD PEOPLE OVER SIXTY TAKES STATINS ARE MANY DO OF COURSE IN THEIR BELIEF IN THEIR CHOLESTEROL IS REDUCED AND THUS THEIR RISK OF HAVING A HEART ATTACK BUT A BOMBSHELL HAS BEEN DROPPED A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE DATA ON THE USEFULNESS OF STATINS PUBLISHED IN THE B.M.J. OPEN GERMINAL THIS IS THE ONLINE ONLY JOURNAL DEDICATED TO PUBLISHING RESEARCH OPEN ACCESS RESEARCH ALL DISCIPLINES
A REVIEW OF PUBLICATION IN THAT JOURNAL HAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE JUST ISN'T A LINK BETWEEN CHOLESTEROL AND DEATH FROM HEART DISEASE DOCTOR MALCOLM KENDRICK IS ON THE LINE AND HE'S A G.P. AND JOINT AUTHOR OF THAT STUDY AND PROFESSOR JEREMY PEARSON ASSOCIATE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION IS THERE MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING DOCTOR KENDRICK EXPLAIN THERE ARE WATCHING
WELL ESSENTIALLY WE WE DECIDED TO LOOK AT NOT TOTAL QUITE STRAW SORRY THOUGH TERMINOLOGY GETS VERY ARCANE VERY QUICKLY WE LOOKED AT THE PART OF CHOLESTEROL CALLED BAD CHOLESTEROL IN POPULAR PARLANCE WHICH IS L.D.L. CHOLESTEROL
AND BECAUSE THE SEVEN BEEN DONE BEFORE THEY WERE IN THE ELDERLY BECAUSE THERE'D BEEN SOME IDEA THAT AS PEOPLE BECAME OLDER THAT STRAW OR L.D.L. CHOLESTEROL WAS ACTUALLY NOT A RISK FACTOR OR ATTENUATED
SO WE THEN DECIDED TO TRY AND FIND ALL THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE LOOKING AT THE LEVELS OF L.D.L. IN GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND LOOKING AT OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE WE FOUND ESSENTIALLY AFTER THE AGE OF SIXTY
WHICH I DON'T LIKE TO THINK I WAS BEING ELDERLY ANY MORE AS I GET VERY CLOSE TO THAT AGE AND AFTER THE AGE OF SIXTY IF YOU HAVE A HIGHER L.D.L. BAD CHOLESTEROL LEVEL YOU WILL ACTUALLY LIVE LONGER AND THERE IS NO INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE FOUND SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED AND I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WRITING ARTICLES FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND TEN YEARS AGO WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE GREAT CON A STROKE ON THE WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT L.D.L. AND OR CHOLESTEROL IS NOT ACTUALLY A CAUSE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
PROFESSOR PEARSON WHO COMMENCED ABSOLUTELY NOT THE STUDY SUMMARISES A GROUP OF PUBLISH STUDIES DOCTOR KENDRICK THINKS THE RESULTS ARE CONTROVERSIAL THA NOT AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN PUBLISHED WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT FOR AGES AND IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN L.D.L. CHOLESTEROL AND DEATH IN THE ELDERLY IS NOT OBVIOUS AND OCCASIONALLY IS INVERSE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU EXPECT IN YOUNGER PEOPLE
HOWEVER ALL THE EVIDENCE FROM LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS DEMONSTRATES VERY CLEARLY THAT LOWER IN CHOLESTEROL REDUCES DEATH OVERALL AND HEART ATTACK AND STROKE REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CURRENT PAPER THAT SUGGESTS THAT SUPPORTS THE AUTHOR'S IDEAS THAT L.D.L. CHOLESTEROL HE'S NOT A MAJOR CAUSE OF HEART DISEASE DOCTOR KENDRICK
I THINK THAT THE RISK OF SAYING THAT'S NONSENSE THAT'S NONSENSE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF A DRUG CALLED WE'LL NEVER HAVE HEARD OF THE STROKE AND IT WAS CALLED EVA TRAP EBB I HAVE YOU HAVE NO I'M TALKING MORE TO THE AUDIENCE HERE WHICH LOWER L.D.L.
BY THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT WHICH IS EQUIVALENT AND GREATER THAN MOST STATINS ACHIEVE ALSO RAISED EIGHT STILL WHICH IS GOOD CHOLESTEROL BY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PER CENT TWELVE THOUSAND PATIENTS WERE PUT ON THIS MEDICATION AND THE TOTAL RESULT WAS ZERO POINT ZERO EFFECT ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY AND EXPLAIN WHY THAT WAS THE CASE AS A PEASANT
THAT'S COMPLICATED I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN THAT RIGHT NOW WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT THE SUMMARY OF PAPERS THAT DOCTOR KENDRICK HAS PRODUCED IN THIS PUBLICATION THE MAJOR NUMBER OF CASES THAT THEY LOOK AT IS FROM ONE STUDY
IF YOU READ THAT STUDY ITSELF THE AUTHORS OF THAT STUDY SAY THE EVIDENCE RECALLS A RELATIONSHIP PRETTY PHILIPPA DELIA AND DEVELOPED A CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IS OVERWHELMING THEY DON'T DISPUTE IT AND THEY ALSO WITHIN THAT PAPER WHICH DOCTOR KENDRICK HASN'T MENTIONED SHOW THAT STATIN PRESCRIPTION AFTER MEASURED MY PROTEINS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT SURVIVAL BENEFIT IN THAT GROUP REGARDLESS OF AGE
SO AGAIN IT TALLIES WITH ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA DUCK ED ARE YOU ACTUALLY SAYING TO PEOPLE OVER SIXTY DON'T TAKE STATICS
I HAVEN'T SAID THAT TO ANYBODY YET WELL THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN MORE DETAIL IT'S CLEAR THAT STATINS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IF YOU TAKE A STATIN FOR FIVE YEARS AND YOU'RE IN THE HIGH RISK GROUP
YOU MAY EXPECT TO LIVE ON APPROXIMATELY FIVE DAYS LONGER THAT WAS PREVIOUS RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN THE B.M.J. WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT'S WORTH IT OR NOT THE EFFECT IS REAL ALTHOUGH VERY SMALL HOWEVER MY CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT THEN THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE L.D.L. LURING THAT STATINS WORK THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS AND THAT WOULD FIT WITH THE FACT THAT MANY OTHER MEDICATIONS HAVE LOWER CHOLESTEROL AND OR L.D.L. CHOLESTEROL AND HAVE HAD NO IMPACT ON OVERALL MORTALITY OR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE I SUPPOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON STARTER'S THING KEEPING US THAT HE'S LISTENING THIS WILL BE THINKING
OH MY GOODNESS WHAT DO I DO I'M NOT SURE I'M ANY CLEARER FRANKLY AT THE END DID HE MEAN YOUR FOR YOUR VIEW IS FROM THE BRITISH HEART FOUNDATION THEY SHOULD CARRY ON TAKING THEM AND THAT THEY ARE WORKING ABSOLUTELY AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON WHY THE GUIDE LINE SHOULD BE CHANGED I WOULD SAY THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU DO SOME GUEST BY FIVE DAYS AS QUOTED BY DOCTOR KENDRICK IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE WE CAN'T ARGUE ABOUT ALL THE PAPERS IN THE LITERATURE
BUT MOST OF THE LONG TERM STUDIES WERE STATINS HAVE SHOWN A REDUCTION IN TOTAL DEATH AND AN INCREASE IN LIFESPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS NOW IS COMPLETELY INCORRECT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON DISAGREEING I'M AFRAID TIME ALL RIGHT WERE WE WHAT DO YOU SAY IT'S A DISAGREEMENT AND WE ARE OUT OF TIME I'M AFRAID BUT THERE THERE THERE WE ARE IT IS A COMPLICATED AREA BUT DOCTOR KENDRICK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US FROM THINKING AND PROFESSOR PEARSON AS WELL

THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHAT SHOULD THE ENGLISH FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES BE DOING NOW THAT THEY'RE FACED WITH THE THREAT OF BEING THROWN OUT OF THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TOURNAMENT IF THEIR SUPPORTERS ARE INVOLVED IN ANY FURTHER VIOLENCE IN A MOMENT THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE F.A. WITH SOME ADVICE FOR THEM FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM LUCY WILLIAMSON IS IN MARSEILLES WHERE THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH FANS ON SATURDAY NIGHT
THERE'S A SLIGHTLY MORE SEDATE ATMOSPHERE IN MARSEILLE'S OLD PAUSE AT LEAST COMPARED TO BREED
ENGLAND FANS HERE HAVE BEGUN LOOKING TOWARDS THE TEAM'S NEXT MATCHING LOTS ON THURSDAY
INDEED AT THE AUTHORITIES BEHIND THIS
WAFER HAS SAID THAT ANY MORE VIOLENCE COULD LEAD TO THE ENGLAND AND RUSSIA TEAMS BEING EXPELLED FROM THE CHAMPIONSHIP
AMONG THE FANS HERE THERE'S A SENSE THAT THE THREAT IS
ALEX SMITH IS AN AERIAL SURVEYOR FROM CHESTER HE'S BOUGHT TICKETS TO EVERY ONE OF THE ENGLAND GAMES AND HE SAYS THAT IN MANY CASES
VIOLETS HERE WAS STARTED BY ORGANISED TROUBLEMAKERS TARGETING THE ENGLISH
IT'S A LITTLE BIT WORRYING I LIKE I SAY I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TALK CAUSED BY ENGLAND REALLY I THINK THE BLAME SHOULD BE
I THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT SHE WOULD GO WOULD GET A TELLING OFF BUT NOT ENGLAND I THINK WAS QUITE OBVIOUSLY RUSSIAN GUY
RIGHT ENGLISH DID
MAINLY BOOKS CAUSING THE TROUBLE SETS BEHALF ENGLAND
THE U.K. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING IT WELCOMES YOU WAFERS DECISION TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION AND THAT IS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE VIOLENCE IN MARSEILLES INCLUDING REPORTS THAT IN SOME CASES ENGLAND FANS WERE ATTACKED BY RIVAL SUPPORTERS
THE FRENCH INTERIOR MINISTER MEN I'VE KAZ AND ED HAS CALLED FOR AN ALCOHOL BAN AROUND FUTURE GATE
ON COOKED IN THERE
I HAVE ASKED FOR ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO PROHIBIT THE SALE CONSUMPTION AND TRANSPORT OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AND SENSITIVE AREAS ON MATCH DAYS AND THE DAY BEFORE AND ON DAYS WHEN VAN OWNS ARE OPEN WHISTLE I'D QUIT
THE QUESTION OF COURSE IS HOW EASY IT WILL BE TO ENFORCE THE BAN RUSSIAN FANS APPARENTLY MANAGED TO SMUGGLE FLARES INTO THE MARSEILLE STADIUM ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY SECURED SITES IN THE TOURNAMENT
AS THE POLICE HERE IN MARSEILLE MIGHT TELL YOU CONTROLLING FERNS POOLED TOGETHER IN THE CITY CENTRE IS AN EVEN BIGGER
THAT WAS LUCY WILLIAMSON IN MARSEILLES LET'S TALK NOW TO MARK PALACE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE F.A. IS ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHO'S TO BLAME DO YOU THINK WHAT HAPPENED
IT'S DIFFICULT WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU CAN'T YOU CUT THERE ARE REPORTS OF A GUARD IN THE ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF BRITISH FARMS US GET THAT OUT THE WAY AND SAY YES THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE BUT I THINK THE AUTHORITIES IN THE ORGANISING AUTHORITIES NEED TO LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND WE ALWAYS USED TO SAY PRE HIS KEY WHAT YOU DO BEFORE A TOURNAMENT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY
AND WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS A COMPLETE FAILURE IN THIS REGARD I KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE INTELLIGENCE LED OPERATION WHICH WAS CO OPERATION WITH OTHER POLICE FORCES THEY WERE IN RELATION TO HIGH RISK ERM FAN GROUPS BACKED UP IN THE U.K. BY A PRETTY ON BRITISH PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH IS BANNING ORDERS THIS PRETTY MUCH AFFECTIVE NOW WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS APPARENTLY COORDINATED
ORGANISED HOOLIGANISM OR ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE WHICH THEN GIVES YOU A CONCERT WILL HAS THAT CO OPERATION HAS THAT PRE PLANNING NOT BEEN AS GOOD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN AMPUTEE AND A THREAT BOTH TO RUSSIA AND TO ENGLAND THAT THEY COULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE COMPETITION IS THAT SOUND THE F.A. SHOULD BE TAKING SERIOUSLY SHOULD THEY BE CONSULTING LAWYERS WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY MIGHT WE TOOK SERIOUSLY COS WE WERE FOLLOWING ON FROM THE THE TOURNAMENT'S IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETY EIGHT WHEN ENGLAND FANS HAD HAD HAD BEEN A. PROBLEM AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT WE LOOKED AT WE TRIED TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WHICH WE COULD BE WHICH WAS THE BEHAVIOUR OF ENGLAND FRANCE IN THE STADIUM WHICH WAS TO BUTCHERS THEN ACCEPTED WE HAD SOME TROUBLE IN ALBUFEIRA I THINK ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THIS THIS IS A SPORTING COMPETITION AND WHILST YES
UEFA HAVE GONE DOWN THE THE TRACK IF WE CAN ONLY LOOK AFTER THE INCIDENTS OUT FROM A DISCIPLINARY ASPECT WITH REGARD TO WHAT GOES ON IN THE STADIUM WHICH IS WHY THEY'VE CHARGED THE RUSSIAN FANS IN THERE IS THE WIDER CONSTRUCT ON THIS IN THAT HE USED IT WELL KNOW IF THERE'S A THREAT TO LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND THEN IT'S THE AUTHORITIES AND THE COUNTRY CONCERNED CAN TAKE A VIEW AND IN THAT REGARD YES OF COURSE IT IS POTENTIALLY
IT IS BUT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR ENGLAND TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TOURNAMENT ON A THINK THEY WILL TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT WHAT THEY CAN DO ON IT IS IS IS SEVERELY LIMITED AT THIS STAGE I'D GET GIVEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE RUSSIAN FANS
HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT THE RUSSIAN STATES ARE HOLDING THE WORLD COME TWENTY EIGHTEEN
ACTUALLY VERY WERE A VERY WORRIED BECAUSE AS I SAID EARLIER IF THE FACT THAT THEY'VE ARRIVED IN WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A PRE MEDITATED FASHION I MEAN WHO GOES TO A GAME IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE IN THE SUMMER WITH A BALACLAVA
SO THEY'VE GONE THEY'RE PREPARED AND THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I THINK IT IS MARK PHILLIPS WHO'S LOOKING AFTER THE POLICEMAN SAID HIS SPOTTERS WHO WERE ON THE GROUND LOOKING FOR ENGLISH HOOLIGANS TO BAN IN THE FUTURE ACTUALLY SAW THE RUSSIAN FANS WHO WERE IN IT USES FROZE TOOLED UP SO YOU ARE CONCERNED THE EXTENT OF THE ORGANISATION HERE NOW IF YOU'RE THEN GOING INTO A COUNTRY THAT DID THAT HAS THIS
AND THEY'RE PREPARED TO TARGET SAY ENGLISH FOUND A GERMAN FANS OR UKRAINIAN FANS THEN YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CONCERNED AND I THINK THIS IS THIS IS THE MAJOR POINT THAT HAS TO COME OUT OF THIS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CO OPERATION WITH THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES WHO I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE ARE CAPABLE OF CUTTING OFF THE HEAD AS IT WERE OF THE ORGANISATION AT THE LOOK OF THE FANS ARE IN RUSSIA THAT HAS TO BE PARAMOUNT AND THERE HAS TO BE LOOKED UP MA PALI ASS FORMATIVE EXACTLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO EIGHT FIFTY DEATH AT THE HANDS OF A MAN WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE IN A FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB THE POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THEM BUT MOST HAVE YET TO BE NAMED

ONCE HE GETS INSIDE HE'S BLOCKING THE EXIT AND NOBODY CAN GO TO THAT EGGS THEY EITHER BY JUMPING HIM OR HER BY JUMPING THE FENCE IN THE BACK I DO MAKE UP ON THERE
RUNNING AND SCREAMING AND THEY'VE GROWN OUR CONTINUED AND WHEN RIADA TRIED TO RUN AS FAST AS THEY COULD OUT OF THE BUILDING
WHEN OUR SHIRTS WERE FILLED WITH BLIND PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR SCREAMING AND WEEDERS WE WE MANAGED TO ESCAPE BUT THEN
AND A TONGUE GOT UP TWO PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING AND ONE WEEK MORMON OR NOT
WE JUST WENT OUT THE BACK DOOR THE COPS RISTORANTE BEEN DOUBLE BILL OF BEANS A HELICOPTER WITH A CUP OF THE BUILDING THE CARS WOULD ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE LEAD
WE'RE GOING ON TILL FIVE A.M. IN THE MORNING WHEN THE SHOULDER FINALLY GOT SHOT BY THE CLUB
AND THE KILLINGS SCENT OR LAND ON THE FRONT PAGES ARE QUITE A FEW OF THE PAPERS AS YOU'D EXPECT THE SUN CALLS THE MASSACRE AMERICA'S BATTER CLERK COMPARES IT TO THE SHOOTINGS AT THE ROCK CONCERT IN PARIS LAST NOVEMBER IN WHICH NINETY PEOPLE DIED THE MIRROR BELIEVES THE GUNMAN OMAR MARTINE WAS EVIL SHOWS HIM HALF SMILING FOR A SELFIE DRESSED IN BLACK THE TIMES IS AMONG SEVERAL PAPERS TO PIECE TOGETHER HIS BACKGROUND THE PAPER SAYS HE WAS BORN IN NEW YORK TO AFGHAN PARENTS HE MOVED FLORIDA TA STUDDED CRIMINAL LAW AT UNIVERSITY

FOUR S. AS A SECURITY GUARD
DAVID CAMERON SUGGESTION THAT STATE PENSIONS MIGHT NO LONGER BE PROTECTED IF WHITTON LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS GREETED WITH SCORN BY SOME PAPERS IT'S THE MAIN FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE EXPRESS WHICH SAYS HE'S BIN TOO TERRIFIED PENSIONERS AS IT PUTS IT SPARKED A FURIOUS BACKLASH FROM ANTI BRUSSELS CAMPAIGNERS THE SUNKEN CLUES THERE'S NOTHING THERE DAVID CAMERON AND GEORGE OSBORNE WON'T SAY TO GET THE REMAIN BOAT THEY CREED THERE IS A STENCH A PARROT
IN DOWNING STREET AND VOTERS WON'T EASILY FORGIVE THE VICIOUS THREATS THE GUARDIANS COLUMNIST MATTHEW DON'T KOHNER FEELS WE HAVE TEN DAYS AWAY FROM MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE FOR DEPLORABLY STUPID REASONS HE CALLS BRECK SAID THE IDIOT OPTION AND ACCUSE THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN OF EXPLOITING THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION WHICH HE SAYS UNITE OUTRIGHT XENOPHOBIA RACISM WITH A MUCH MORE GENERAL FAIR OF GLOBALISATION AND THE FORCES OF CHANGE TEARING THROUGH THE LABOUR MARKET IN THE SURGE IN POPULATION MOBILITY
WHEN SEARCHING FOR THE LOST REMAINS OF AN ENGLISH KING EIGHT CAR PARK IS PERHAPS THE BEST PLACE TO START UP THAT'S WHAT THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT REPORTS THAT FOUR YEARS AFTER THE BONES OF RICHARD THE THIRD WITH I'M BE CAR PARK IN LEICESTER SURVEYORS HAVE BEGUN SCARRING ASIDE IN READING TO FIND THE RESTING PLACE OF HENRY THE FIRST PAPER SAYS ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR TO DETECT

OVER THE WEEKEND THIRTEEN OF BRITAIN'S NOBEL LAUREATES ADDED THEIR VOICES TO THE CHORUS EMANATING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY URGING THE BRITISH PUBLIC TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN YOU THAT HER GRAVE UNANIMITY
IS SURPRISING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT DISAGREEING IS WHAT SOUND HAS MEANT TO DO THERE'S A CLUE IN THE MOTTO OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY TAKE NO ONE'S WORD FOR IT AND MOST OF THEM SPEND THEIR ENTIRE WORKING LIVES TRYING TO DISPROVE OR DISCREDIT EACH OTHER'S THEORY SO WHAT IS GALVANISING THEM ON THIS A SCIENCE EDITOR TOM FIELD AND REPORTS FROM CAMBRIDGE
GOING TO EXTRACT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGIST DOCTOR OLIVIER REST DIEF SHOWS ME AROUND HIS LAB WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AT CAMBRIDGE SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW WITH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
WE DON'T REACT TO THE BACTERIA AS YOU CAN NO DOUBT HERE FROM HIS ACCENT THE LIVIA IS FRENCH
AND HE'S BY NO MEANS ALONE NEARLY A THIRD OF ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS WORKING IN CAMBRIDGE OVERSEAS NATIONALS TWENTY THREE PER CENT FROM OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES
THE REFLECTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL NATURE OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION I GREW UP IN FRANCE IT WOULDN'T MICE TEDDIES ON MY P.H.D. IN PARIS AREN'T THEN WANTED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE ON THE U.K. WIRES ON STEEL IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACES TO BE SCIENCE
AND CAMBRIDGE AND INDEED U.K. SCIENCE HAS THRIVED IN THIS COLLABORATIVE INTERNATIONALIST ENVIRONMENT EMERGING AS EUROPE'S SCIENTIFIC POWERHOUSE FROM PUNCHING WELL ABOVE ITS WEIGHT IN TERMS OF RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED CITATIONS UNIVERSITY RANKINGS AND NOBEL PRIZES
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DISTINGUISH SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION WOULD BE A DISASTER SO MUCH SO THAT THE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT HAS COME OUT EMPHATICALLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE EBU LOBBYING MINISTERS TAKING PART IN DEBATES WRITING A SHEAF OF LETTERS TO THE EDITOR WE'RE BENEFITING MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
FROM THE E.U. THE PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AND DAVIES WAS ONE OF TWO HUNDRED CAMBRIDGE DONS DAMES NIGHTS AND NOBEL LAUREATES TO SIGN A LETTER REGISTERING THEIR GRAVE CONCERNS AT THE HIM
BRICKS BOOT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE COMING IN THEY'RE TEACHING A CAUTIOUS IN THERE DOING THE RESEARCH BUT THEY'RE BRINGING SO MUCH MORE
THE CROSS FERTILISATION OF IDEAS THE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES E.U. NATIONALS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.K. BRING TO YOU KAY
NOT THE OVERSTATED BUT IS THIS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS ARGUMENT REALLY THE RESULT OF E.U. MEMBERSHIP
THE MONEY ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY ONLY ADDS UP TO ABOUT THREE PERCENT OF TOTAL HORROR AND EXPENDITURE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
TO APPLY FOR IT THIS IS THE SURPRISING THING WAS I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ACTUALLY I HAD TO LEARN NO RIDLEY SITS ON THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF FLOORS IS THAT F. P. SEVEN HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY AT THE MAIN E.U. FUNDING PROGRAMMES ARE OPEN TO COUNTRIES LIKE TUNISIA AND ISRAEL AND ICELAND AND NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND AND SO ON SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT THE E. YOU WOULD NOT LET US CONTRIBUTE TO AND TAKE MONEY FROM THOSE PROGRAMMES AS THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC NATION
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE PROGRAMMES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT TECHNICALLY IT WOULD BUT SURELY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER MAKING IT EVEN SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT
IT'S SORT OF UNDERMINES AND ERODES THAT ABILITY TO TO CO OPERATE I THINK ACTUALLY WOULD BE STRONGER BECAUSE I THINK WE WOULD BE GETTING SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATIONS AND SCIENTIFIC IMMIGRATION FROM ASIA AMERICA
INDIAN SUBCONTINENT ALL THESE OTHER COMING SCIENTIFIC POWER HOUSES OF THE WORLD JUST AS MUCH AS WE WOULD GET IT FROM THE E.U. THE E.U. IS A VERY SMALL PART OF THE WORLD SCIENTIFIC UNIVERSE NOW AND WE ARE AT THE MOMENT DISCRIMINATING IN FAVOUR OF INDESCRIBABLY DENSE THE REST
THAT BLUE BALL RATHER THAN EUROPEAN APPROACH TO SCIENCE IS ALSO RICKIE'S TEAM FOR THE STEW VAPOURS THREE CAMBRIDGE BRICK EXIT
OUT ON THE STUMP IN THE CITY'S MARKET SQUARE IT'S ALL GROUP THINKING CAMBRIDGE'S
THE POSITIVES OR VISION FOR BRITAIN IS TO BE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION I'M CHARLES A STEADY CAM FINDS I'VE JUST FINISHED LAST YEAR THIS YEAR SO I'M GRADUATING
IN SEPTEMBER SO I EITHER WAY I VIEW BREAKS IT IS A WAY TO LIBERATE BRITAIN FROM SCLEROTIC ORGANISATION OPEN UP A FRONTIER
BE PART OF AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS SUCH A DISDAIN FOR DEMOCRACY IN THERE
TALKING OF POPULAR WILL
ALSO OUT IN FORCE WITH THEIR A STORE AND IT HAS TO BE SAID THERE SOMEWHERE
JAMES AND I HAVING TO PLAY SECOND FIDDLE TO AN ALTOGETHER MORE ENERGETIC
YOLA STRAWBERRY
THAT WAS DONE FIELD AND IN CAMBRIDGE WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THEM IN AN HOUR'S TIME TIME NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A NEWCASTLE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON WHO IS PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THE TRAGEDY OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED OR INJURED IN AN ACT OF TERRORISM AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB FULL OF JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE FATAL SHOOTING OF SINGER CHRISTINE A GRIM IN THE SAME CITY
THESE A VENTURE I'M SPOTLIGHT NOT ONLY ON ORLANDO BUT MORE FUNDAMENTALLY ON THE NATURE OF THE WORLD
SUCH ATTACKS UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNCOMMON THE MASS SHOOTING TRACKER REPORTS AT LAST YEAR ALONE IN THE U.S. FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY WOUNDED
BUT THIS ACT OF TERROR AND HATE IS THE WORST IN AMERICAN RECENT HISTORY AND IN THE WORDS OF MAN BUDDY DIET WAS UNIMAGINABLE OF COURSE EVEN THIS INCIDENT IS DWARFED BY VIOLENCE IN PLACES SUCH AS LIBYA AND SYRIA
BUT THE SHOCK OF THE ATTACK AND FLORIDA ALTHOUGH PRIMARILY DUE TO ITS SCALE AND BRUTALITY MAY BE HEIGHTENED BY ITS LOCATION TOURISTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO VISIT ORLANDO TO EXPLORE ITS THEME PARKS TO ENCOUNTER A WORLD OF DREAMS AND A NEVER ENDING STORY
HAVING TAUGHT PREACHED A NUMBER OF ITS CHURCHES AND ENJOYED ITS BEAUTY AND EXCITEMENT ON VACATION IT SEEMS TO PROJECT AN IMAGE OF A LIVING HAPPILY EVER AFTER IN A WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT
HUMAN LIFE IS NOT LIKE THAT AND WHILE FAIRY STORIES TO COMIC BOOK MARVEL SUPERHEROES PROMISE A HAPPY ENDING EVEN MAY REFLECT HUMAN EXISTENCE ARE SHOT THROUGH WITH TERROR EVIL INVULNERABILITY
WHEN IT COMES TO EQUAL THEIR CHRISTIAN FAITH DOESN'T OFFER EASY SIMPLE ANSWERS AS TO WHY SUCH THINGS HAPPEN
HOWEVER IT DOES RECOGNISE THE BEAUTY AND POTENTIAL OF HUMAN BEINGS ALONGSIDE THE BROKENNESS WHICH MEANS THAT FREEDOM CAN BE EXERCISED IN A WAY THAT HARMS OTHERS
THERE IS HOPE IN THE FACE OF VIOLENCE THAT ONE DAY PEACE AND RECONCILIATION WILL COME BUT WE NEED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN STRIVING FOR SUCH PEACE AND JUSTICE WHETHER IT BE IN GUN CONTROL OR OPPOSING RADICALISATION
THE BASIS OF THIS HOPE WAS SUMMED UP BY ARCHBISHOP JUSTIN WELBY AND HIS SERMON AS PART OF THE CELEBRATION OF THE QUEEN'S NINETIETH BIRTHDAY
HE POINTED OUT THAT WHAT SUSTAINS HER AND FELLOW CHRISTIANS IN TIMES OF TURMOIL IS THAT THE STORY OF JESUS SHOWS US A GOD ENTERS INTO THE MOST FEARFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE IN OUR LIVES HAVE SAME BETRAYAL VIOLENCE REJECTION EVEN
VIOLENT ATROCITIES CANNOT BE IGNORED WHETHER THEY MAKE THE NEWS OR NOT BUT THEY SHOULDN'T TAKE US TO A PLACE OF DESPAIR WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THEY CANNOT BE DEFEATED
MY CHRISTIAN HOPE IT'S NOT A BUILDING A PERFECT WORLD BUT THAT LOVE EVENTUALLY WILL TRIUMPH OVER EVIL
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND PROFESSOR DAVID WILKINSON PRINCIPAL OF SAINT JOHN'S COLLEGE AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY THE TIME EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT IF WE VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ON NEXT THURSDAY AT THE LEVEL OF NET MIGRATION WILL STAY AT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WHAT THE PRESSURE GROUP MIGRATION WATCH HAS FORECAST IT'S VICE CHAIRMAN IS OUTLOOK THAT HE IS WITH ME GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING HOW MANY OF THOSE FROM THE EUROPEAN YOU KNOW HOW MANY FROM OUTSIDE IT
SIXTY PER CENT OF THAT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL BE FROM THE E.U. SO THE MAJORITY WILL BE FROM THE E. HOW HE ARRIVED AT THAT FIGURE WE HAVE LOOKED AT PRESENT FIGURES WE HAVE COMPARED
I LIKE A NET MIGRATION SCENARIO WITH A HIGH ONE AND ARRIVED AT TWO SIX FIVE WHICH IS MORE OR LESS WHAT THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS SAY IS THE LIKELY HIGH NET MIGRATION SCENARIO SOUNDS A BIT LIKE STICKING YOU'RE LICKING YOUR FINGERS STICKING TO THE YOU SORT OF GET INTO WELL WE HAVEN'T DONE SOMEBODY SCIENTIFIC THAT
THAT MAY SEEM A BIT LIKE THAT ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO HAVE A RATHER GOOD TRACK RECORD OF
GETTING IT RIGHT WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND ONLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SITTING IN THIS CHAIR YOU WERE YOU WERE TAKING ME TO TASK ABOUT OUR FORECAST FOR THE NUMBER OF ROMANIANS AND BULGARIANS WHO WOULD COME HERE NO THEY WON'T COME I'M NOT SURE I SAID NOT YOU DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T WHY DO YOU SAY THAT IS IT NO BUT NO YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT IN FACT IT'S THE LATEST FIGURES SUGGEST THAT IS
AT FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR SAY ALL RIGHT BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT FAR OUT BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS WHAT FACTORS YOU'VE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO ARRIVE AT THAT FIGURE THAT TWO TICKS LIKE THOUSAND FIGURE WE HAVE LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF FACTORS FOR EXAMPLE THE POPULATION OF THE THE E.U. BORN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY
WE HAVE LOOKED AT SARRA SALARY LEVELS BETWEEN VARIOUS COUNTRIES THERE THE PULL FACTOR THAT'S GOING TO BE HERE AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN EASTERN EUROPE ONE COUNTRY FROM THE EASTERN
FROM EASTERN EUROPE JOINT TEN YEARS TWELVE YEARS AGO BUT WHEN YOU LOOK OUT TO AS FAR INTO THE FUTURE AS FAR AHEAD AS TWENTY YEARS YOU HAVE NO IDEA BUT NOT AS ANYBODY ELSE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST FACTOR OF ALL HIS NUDE IF WE ARE DOING VERY WELL WE'RE RICH OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO SHARE IN THAT WE'RE NOT RICH OF THE ECONOMY DOES BADLY THEY WON'T WANT TO COME WELL IT'S NOT JUST HOW WELL WE'RE DOING A BIG FACTOR
IT OF COURSE IS A BIG FACTOR BUT IT'S NOT JUST HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IT HOW WELL THE COUNTRIES FROM WHICH THE MIGRANTS ARE GOING TO BE COMING INDEED AND WE THAT EITHER BUT WELL REINFORCES MY POINT DOESN'T IT IT'S TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT DISPARITY BETWEEN US
I SUSPECT THAT WITHIN TWENTY YEARS OF ROMANIA BULGARIA AND INDEED COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND ARE NOT SUDDENLY GOING TO COME ON A PAR WITH WITH US IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE YOU INCLUDED TURKEY IN YOUR CALCULATION WE HAVEN'T INCLUDED IN OUR CALCULATIONS WERE WE TO INCLUDE TURKEY IT WOULD BE ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FOUR AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR
INDEED THEY WERE TO JOIN SAY BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HAVE YOU DONE ANY CALCULATIONS AS TO THE EFFECT THAT ARE ADOPTING AN AUSTRALIAN POINTS BASED SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MIGHT HAVE WE DON'T THINK THAT THE AUSTRALIAN POINTS BASED SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT ONE FOR US BUT WHAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT HAD IS APPLYING THE SORT A WORK PERMIT SYSTEM BUT WE APPLY AT THE MOMENT TOO
NOT ON THE MENU AND THEN WITH THAT IN MIND GIVEN THAT MOST PEOPLE COME HERE TO WORK SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE COMING FROM EASTERN EUROPE SIXTY PER CENT OVERALL ACTUALLY
AND GO INTO LOW SKILL LOW LEVEL LOW PAID JOBS APPLYING WORK PERMITS AND ONLY THE SKILLED HIGHLY SKILLED COMING IN WE IN FACT RECKON BY A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND FEWER PEOPLE COME FINAL QUICK THOUGHT DOES MIGRATION WATCH TAKE A VIEW ON WHETHER WE SHOULD LEAVE OR WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY
NO WE DO NOT THERE ARE WIDER ISSUES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WERE WE TO VOTE ON THE TWENTY THIRD THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO E.U. MIGRATION ALBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY PLEASURE THAT HAD THREE MINUTES DATE PHILIP EVER IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER AS ONE OF THEIR FELLOW
JUSTIN VERY GOOD MORNING TO THE FORECAST FOR THE SOUTHWEST OF ENGLAND WALES THE SOUTH WEST MIDLANDS AND NORTHERN IRELAND FAIRLY DANKE FAIR HERE IN PLACES AS YOU GET ON THROUGH THE DAY SO THIS BELT OF RAIN MAY MOVE ON THROUGH HINTS OF BRIGHTNESS FOLLOWING ON BEHIND BUT BEHIND PERHAPS FOR THE FAVOURED FEW BUT THAT BRIGHTNESS MAY IN ITS OWN RIGHT TRIGGER SOME PRETTY HEFTY SHOWERS WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE TEMPERATURE AROUND ABOUT THE MID TEENS OR SO
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT FURTHER NORTH TO THE SOUTH WEST OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND THE NORTH AND EAST MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA IN THE SOUTH EAST WHERE THERE ARE ISLANDS OF BRIGHTNESS HERE AT THE MOMENT TO DECENT MOURNING IN PARTS OF KENT BUT COME THE AFTERNOON ONCE YOU INHERIT THE MOISTURE FROM THE WEST THAT MAY IN ITS OWN RIGHT AGAIN TRIGGER SOME OF THESE HEAVY AND THUNDERY DOWNPOURS THE MET OFFICE HAVE SOME WARNINGS ABOUT THESE THE SORT OF THING THAT WE'VE SEEN OF LATE TEMPERATURE AGAIN AROUND ABOUT THE MID TO UPPER TEENS
TO THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND SOUTH EASTERN SCOTLAND FOGGY FARE HERE RIGHT FROM THE WORD GO AND IT STAYS MISERABLE FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THE CLOUD SITTING VERY LOW IN THE ATMOSPHERE ADDED TO THAT A BIT OF RAIN AND DRIZZLE IN THE MIX AND AS YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE TEMPERATURES NOT REALLY THAT CHEERY TWELVE THIRTEEN SOMETHING OF THAT ORDER
FINALLY TO THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND THE NORTH WEST A FERMENT OF CLOUD THE ODD SHOWER THE NORTH EAST OF SCOTLAND DRY FINE AND SUNNY WITH A HIGH OF SEVENTY
THANK YOU FILM ALL THIS WEEK THE WOMAN'S A PRESENTER'S JENNI MURRAY AND JANE GARVEY GET SOME EXTRA HELP A WEEK OF GUEST EDITORS ON WOMAN'S HOUR STARTING WITH MARY BERRY YOU'RE IN CHARGE ON MONDAY MORNING I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS YOU'RE NERVOUS WHAT ABOUT ME

BEEKEEPING BECAUSE THAT I WANT TO KNOW MORE O. KAY GOOD AND GENERAL GOOD MANNERS AND MAKING THINGS FROM SCRATCH HOMEMADE GIFTS THAT'S VERY MUCH WHAT I LIKE TO DO
MARY BERRY IS THE GUEST EDITOR FOR WOMAN'S HOUR PRESENTED BY JANE GARVEY ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR THE SWANNING AND TEN
IN THE NEXT HOUR AFTER HE'S AWFUL EVENTS IN ORLANDO OVER THE WEEKEND WE WILL BE HEARING FROM MARK OR RUBY OR THEM FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL ON WHAT HE THINKS NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW SPECIFICALLY ACROSS THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL PLUS GORDON BROWN FOR THE PRIME MINISTER IS GOING ME TALKING ABOUT BRECHT SET TO JOHN AT TWENTY PAST THIS IS TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON MONDAY THE THIRTEENTH OF JUNE THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE GUNMAN WHO KILLED FIFTY PEOPLE IN AMERICA'S WORST MASS SHOOTING WAS INTERVIEWED THREE TIMES BY THE F.B.I. ON SUSPICION OF LINKS TO TERRORISM BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
GORDON BROWN WILL TELL LABOUR VOTERS THERE THEY HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM E.U. MEMBERSHIP AND OPPRESSIVE GREW CONCERNED ABOUT POPULATION GROWTH IS FORECASTING ANNUAL NET MIGRATION AT LEAST A QUARTER OF A MILLION FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF THIS COUNTRY STAYS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE F.B.I. HAS SAID THE GUNMAN WHO SHOT DEAD FIFTY PEOPLE AT A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN FLORIDA WAS INVESTIGATED FOR POSSIBLE TERRORISM LINKS BUT OFFICIALS CONCLUDED HE DIDN'T POSE A THREAT
IMAM OR TEAM CARRIED OUT THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN MODERN U.S. HISTORY IN THE EARLY HOURS OF YESTERDAY MORNING HE'D BEEN INTERVIEWED ON THREE OCCASIONS BY THE F.B.I. ABOUT HIS ALLEGED TIES TO TERRORISTS BUT WHEN THE FINAL INVESTIGATION WAS DROPPED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AGENTS DECIDED NOT TO PLACE HIM ON A TERRORISM WATCH LIST HIS FORMER WIFE HAS SAID HE WAS MENTALLY ILL A CORRESPONDENT TO LEE MC BALL REPORTS FROM ORLANDO
AS THE DEPRESSING LIST OF VICTIMS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED GETS LONGER MORE DETAILS ARE EMERGING OF THE MAN WHO SHOT THEM DEAD AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB OH MUM HAD SEEN THE TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD U.S. CITIZEN OF AFGHAN ORIGIN CALLED NINE ONE ONE BEFORE THE ATTACK DECLARING HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE HEAD OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
HE ENTERED THE CLUB AT ABOUT TWO A.M. FIRING IT WILL WITH TWO WEAPONS A HANDGUN AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HAVE BOTH BEEN BOUGHT WITHIN THE LAST WEEK IT'S LED TO RENEWED CALLS AMONG SOME FOR BETTER GUN CONTROL MEASURES IN AMERICA BUT OTHERS LIKE FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAYING THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER
YOU SIGN EUROPE IN THEIR PARENTS' ATTACKS WHERE THESE GUNS ARE ONLY HONEST NOT VERY MUCH
THE BOTTOM FROM THE BLACK MARKET IS TERENCE YOU'RE COMMITTED
I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS LESS ON THE WEAPON THEY USED THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT WHICH IS A RADICAL INTERPRETATION
THE F.B.I. SAID HE'D INTERVIEWED OMAN THE TEAM ON THREE OCCASIONS BUT DECIDED ANY LINKS TO MILITANT ISLAM WERE TENUOUS MANY ARE NOW ASKING WHETHER MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT SUCH A HORRIFIC ATTACK
OPPONENTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF TRYING TO MAKE POLITICAL CAPITAL OUT OF THE SHOOTING THE BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN RENEWED HIS CALL FOR MUSLIMS TO BE BANNED FROM ENTERING THE U.S. CLAIMING THE ATTACK ILLUSTRATED THE WEAK LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT OBAMA OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK BRYANT REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON
DECLARING THAT AMERICA COULD NOT AFFORD TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT ANY MORE DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE LAMBO MASSACRE BY CALLING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO RESIGN FOR NOT USING THE WORDS RADICAL ISLAM IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTACK AND LAMBASTING HILLARY CLINTON CLAIMING SHE WANTED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE IMMIGRATION FROM THE MIDDLE EAST BRINGING IN MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DURING HER FIRST TERM
BOTH THE TIMING AND TONE OF HIS COMMENTS ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT HE THANKS SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR CONGRATULATIONS ABOUT BEING WRITERS HE PUT IT A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM HAVE BROUGHT AN ACID SHOWER OF CRITICISM FROM OPPONENTS
A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN CALLED THE BILLIONAIRE A NARCISSISTIC MAN BABY WHO TURNED A NATIONAL TRAGEDY INTO A MOMENT OF SELF CONGRATULATION BUT DONALD TRUMP AS SEVE REPEATEDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE ATTACKS ON PARIS SAN BERNARDINO AND BRUSSELS THAT HIS UNCOMPROMISING REMARKS PARTLY EXPLAIN HIS UNEXPECTED POLITICAL SUCCESS
ARE NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO POOL CONSIDERS WHAT LIES BEHIND AMERICA'S LATEST TRAGEDY THE INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT LED OBAMA TEAM TO CONDUCT THIS MASS KILLING IN ORLANDO IS AT AN EARLY STAGE THAT IT ALREADY APPEARS THREE STRANDS HAVE COME TOGETHER IN A LETHAL COCKTAIL THAT THROW A HARSH LIGHT ON AMERICAN SOCIETY
HE WAS RADICALISED ON THE INTERNET AND IS A HOME GROWN LONE WOLF KILLER THAT IS THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DESPITE HAVING COME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE F.B.I. HE WASN'T ON A TERROR WATCH LIST SECONDLY ACCORDING TO HIS FORMER WIFE WHO SAYS SHE HAD TO BE RESCUED AFTER JUST FOUR MONTHS OF MARRIAGE HE HAD MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WAS SUBJECT TO VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS
AND ALL THIS IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE GUNS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE WITH ONLY SCANT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THE SUITABILITY OF THOSE BUYING THEM THE MILITARY STYLE ASSAULT RIFLE USED IN THIS ATTACK IS STILL LEGAL
AND WITH THE POLITICS AROUND THESE ISSUES SO ENTRENCHED AND TOXIC NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE ANY TIME SOON
GORDON BROWN WILL TAKE CENTRE STAGE IN THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN TODAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENCOURAGE LABOUR SUPPORTERS TO VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN A SPEECH IN LEICESTER HE'LL SAY THE Y. YOU CAN DELIVER POLICIES CLOSE TO LABOUR VOTERS HEARTS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER IS BEGINNING A WEEK OF INTENSE ACTIVITY BY LABOUR FIGURES WITH SENIOR CONSERVATIVES TAKING A LOWER PROFILE HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN WATSON
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL TEMPORARILY DEPART TO THEIR CAMPAIGN STAGE AND MAKE WAY FOR HIS PREDECESSOR AT NUMBER TEN GORDON BROWN WILL MAKE WHAT HE'S CALLING THE POSITIVE CASE FOR REMAINING IN THE E.U. INCLUDING ACTION WITH OTHER MEMBER STATES TO CREATE JOBS HELPED ENVIRONMENT AND CLAMP DOWN ON CORPORATE TAX AVOIDANCE
THE CHANGE OF TONE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE LABOUR SOURCES SAY THEIR OWN FOCUS GROUPS WERE SUGGESTING THAT PROJECT FEAR WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING PROJECT FAILURE
BUT THE LABOUR M.P. GIVES THE STUART THE CHEERS THE OFFICIAL LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAID HER PARTY'S VOTERS HAD MOST SEEN THROUGH GOVERNMENT SPIN AND NO AMOUNT OF HISTORY COBBLED TOGETHER RELAUNCHES WE'D CHANGE THAT
A STUDY BY A GROUP THAT WANTS LOWER IMMIGRATION HAS FORECAST THAT IF BRITAIN VOTES TO REMAIN IN THE NET MIGRATION WILL RUN AT MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION A YEAR FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS THE REPORT BY MIGRATION WATCH SAYS THERE'S WIDESPREAD COMPLACENCY AND DENIAL ABOUT RAPID POPULATION GROWTH IS ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
TODAY'S REPORT PAINTS A PICTURE OF CONTINUING HIGH LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION FOR A GENERATION TO COME UNDER A PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO THE THINK TANK CALCULATES IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME NET MIGRATION COULD STILL BE ALMOST AS HIGH AS IT IS TODAY AT AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR WITH SIXTY PER CENT OF THAT TOTAL FROM THE E.U.
HOWEVER IF TURKEY IS ALLOWED TO JOIN THERE'D BE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TURKS ARRIVING EACH YEAR THE REPORT HAS BEEN SEIZED ON BY BRECHT'S AT SUPPORTERS TO BUTTRESS THEIR CLAIM THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NET MIGRATION SO LONG AS BRITAIN REMAINS IN THAT YOU
REMAIN CAMPAIGNERS IN SAYS THE BENEFIT CURBS ON E.U. MIGRANTS AND A RECOVERY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES WILL GRADUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBERS YESTERDAY THE PRIME MINISTER ALSO SAID THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF TURKEY JOINING UNTIL THE YEAR THREE THOUSAND THE CONCERN OF THE REMAIN CAMP THOUGH WILL BE THAT THIS REPORT AGAIN FOCUSES ATTENTION ON AN ISSUE THEY ARE DESPERATE SHOULD NOT DOMINATE THE FINAL STAGES OF THIS REFERENDUM
B.T.'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND TO TRADE UNIONS REPRESENTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS ARE SENDING A JOINT LETTER TO STAFF TODAY SUPPORTING BRITAIN'S E.U. MEMBERSHIP MORE DETAILS FROM OUR BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK
B.T. IS NOT THE FIRST COMPANY TO TAKE SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM BUT IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND THE FIRST TO GET THE EXPLICIT SUPPORT OF ITS OWN WORKERS' UNIONS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND BEATTY STAFF WILL GET A MOMENT SIGNED BY THE CHAIRMAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND LEADERS FROM THE SEAT W. YOU AND PROSPECT UNION'S SETTING OUT WHY THEY BELIEVE STAYING IN THE E.U. IS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS EMPLOYEES IT WILL ALSO SAY THE COMPANY NOT ONLY HAS A RIGHT TO SPEAK OUT IN THIS WAY
THERE'S AN OBLIGATION OR CONCEDING IT'S ULTIMATELY A MATTER FOR INDIVIDUAL VOTERS FORD B.M.W. AND MICROSOFT ARE AMONG OTHER BIG EMPLOYERS TO HAVE SENT SIMILAR LETTERS AND SURVEYS OF BUSINESSES HAVE SHOWN THE BIGGER ORGANISATIONS TEND TO FAVOUR A MAIN J.C.B. WAS AN EXCEPTION AND THE VIEW AMONG SMALL BUSINESSES IS MORE EVENLY SPLIT
THE SOUTH AFRICAN ATHLETE OSCAR PISTORIUS WILL RETURN TO COURT IN PRETORIA TODAY FOR THE START OF A HEARING AT WHICH HE'LL BE SENTENCED FOR THE MURDER OF HIS GIRLFRIEND READER STAY IN CAMP IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SOUTH AFRICA'S SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED THE ORIGINAL VERDICT OF CULPABLE HOMICIDE LAST YEAR
A LEADING THE CITY INVESTOR HAS CALLED ON ONE OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST HOUSE BUILDING FIRMS PERSIMMON TO CUT BACK IT'S EXECUTIVE PAY PLAN THE SCHEME COULD SEE THEIR MANAGEMENT TEAM SHARE A SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OVER FIVE YEARS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE STANDS TO RECEIVE ONE HUNDRED MILLION THE FIRM HAS DEFENDED THE PAY OUT SAYING THAT SINCE THE SCHEME IS BEING IN PLACE PERSIMMON HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF NEW HOMES IT BUILDS BY A HALF
BUT MIKE FOX THE HEAD OF SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT AT ROYAL LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT TOLD US THE PAYMENTS WERE TOO HIGH IF YOU TAKE THE HOUSING INDUSTRY WHERE THIS PERCEIVED TO BE A HOUSING SHORTAGE IF YOU TAKE THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE HOUSING MARKET TO TRY AND RESOLVE THAT I THINK ANY BOARD OPERATING A HOUSING COMPANY SHOULD ASK ITSELF THE WISDOM HAD MAKING AN AWARD OF THIS SCALE IN THAT CONTEXT
THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY ANDY BURNHAM WILL URGE M.P.S TODAY TO SUPPORT HER SO CALLED HILLSBOROUGH LAW THE PROPOSAL AN AMENDMENT TO THE POLICING IN CRIME BILL WOULD ENSURE BEREAVED FAMILIES RECEIVE THE SAME LEGAL FUNDING AS POLICE AT INQUESTS MY BURNHAM SAID THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES TWENTY SEVEN YEAR FIGHT SHOWED HOW THE ODDS WERE STACKED AGAINST ORDINARY PEOPLE SEEKING TRUTH AND JUSTICE
THE BRITISH ACTRESS CYNTHIA THOUGH HAS WON A TONY AWARD FOR HER ROLE IN THE BROADWAY REVIVAL OF THE COLOUR PURPLE THE WARDS IN NEW YORK WERE DOMINATED BY THE HIP HOP MUSICAL HAMILTON WHICH TELLS THE STORY OF ONE OF AMERICA'S LESSER KNOWN FOUNDING FATHERS IT WON BEST MUSICAL BEST SCORE AND BEST LEADING ACTOR
THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE SLAUGHTERED BY OMAR MY TEAM IN THE PULSE GAY BAR IN ORLANDO WERE ABLE TO TEXT THEIR RELATIVES BEFORE THEY DIED MOTHER MEENA JUSTICE SAID HER SON TEXTED HE HAS US AND HE'S GOING TO KILL US
THAT SHE SAID WAS IT SHE HEARD NO MORE FROM HER SON AND THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY RECENT HISTORY AT ANY RATE LEAVES FIFTY DEAD MANY HUNDREDS GRIEVING AND A HUGE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS OF COURSE ABOUT SECURITY ABOUT THE POLITICS OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND OF COURSE ABOUT GUNS
THE KILLER OVER MY TEAM WAS A MUSLIM WHO HAD THREE TIMES BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. TWICE WHEN HE MADE WHAT WERE CALLED INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS TO CO WORKERS AND THEN AGAIN WHEN OFFICIALS FOUND THAT HE HAD TIES TO AN AMERICAN SUICIDE BOMBER IN SYRIA SEPARATELY HIS EX WIFE SAID HE WAS MENTALLY UNSTABLE AND HAD BEEN VIOLENT TO HER
BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE TEAM WAS ABLE TO BUY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO AND QUITE LEGALLY AN ASSAULT RIFLE AND AMMUNITION SEAN TELL DANI IS A CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF THE KILLER
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I WOULD SAY PROBABLY NINE TEN YEARS OLD AS WHEN I FIRST MET OMAR WE WENT TO THE SAME MASK IN CIRCUS FLORIDA HE WASN'T AN ABNORMAL KID
WE WOULD PRAY YOU DINNER TOGETHER MY BROTHER HE DIE WOULD YOU NO SLEEP OVER AT EACH OTHER'S HOUSES AND KNOW AFTER PRAYER PLAY BASKETBALL TOGETHER OR PLAY FOOTBALL TOGETHER
RUSSELL NOTHING NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY I LOST TOUCH WITH THEM YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT OFF TO COLLEGE SO I HAVEN'T HURT HIM IN SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN BUT AS I KNEW HIM AS A CHILD IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ORDINARY CHILD A BIT AND THAT WAS THE CASE RIGHT THROUGH INTO TEENS WAS IT
YES BUT WHEN AFTER GRADUATING IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BUT I HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE PROBABLY MY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND HE HE'D NOT REALLY CHANGED MUCH IN TERMS OF HE NEVER EXPRESSED
HOMOPHOBIC TENDENCIES ARE NEVER EXPRESSED ANY OR ACTED OUT ANY VIOLENCE OR AGGRESSION TOWARDS ANYBODY AS LONG AS I KNEW HIM SO WHEN YOU HEAR HIS FORMER WIFE SAYING THAT HE WAS A VIOLENT PERSON THAT THAT'S A SURPRISE TO YOU IS IT
I HAD HEARD RUMOURS AROUND THE MASK HE NEVER CONFIRMED IT PERSONALLY TO ME WHEN HE WAS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP BUT I HAD HEARD RUMOURS OF THAT IT'S INTERESTING SO PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT HIM AND HE HAD THAT THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS WITH HIM WASN'T YET THE TIME ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF THAT RELATIONSHIP I DEFINITELY BELIEVE HIS EX WIFE WHEN SHE SAYS HE NEVER SINGS ABOUT UM I HAVE NO NO EVIDENCE OR REASON TO DOUBT HER
TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU ALL GREW UP TOGETHER THAT TO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ABOUT RADICALISATION IS IT SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE CHAT ABOUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S AN ISSUE
YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS IT'S AN ISSUE WHEN THING IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S A PEACEFUL RELIGION I'M SURE YOU KNOW MUSLIMS WHO ARE VERY PEACEFUL FRIENDLY HAPPY PEOPLE JUST GOING ALONG WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND IN THE MASK I GREW UP WITH NINE OF THE TEACHINGS HAD IT AN INTERIOR OR REMOTELY SUGGESTED ANYTHING ABOUT VIOLENCE OR AGGRESSION OR RADICALISM
BUT IT'S IT'S A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE FOR PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE RELIGION PEACEFULLY YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THIS TRAGEDY FOR ALL THE VICTIMS BUT IF YOU THOUGHT OF HOW IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE FACT HIS FAMILY AND HIS FAMILY I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE UNDER ATTACK
YOU KNOW HIS FRIENDS AND THE MUSCLES IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ATTACK THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNDER ATTACK NOW AND IT'S JUST A SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT YEAH WE TALK ABOUT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM I DON'T LIKE THE TERM BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY A RELIGION OF PEACE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE STUDIED AND LEARNED FROM IT
BUT IT'S A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN NO WAY DO I HAVE ANY SYMPATHY OR COMPASSION FOR ANYBODY WHO IS GOING TO HARM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR BELIEFS OR STARTS SEAN CHECK DANI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
I'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING TO JULIET CHI I AM WHO WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY I ASKED HER IF BY INTERVIEWING MARTINE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT TAKING NO FURTHER ACTION THE F.B.I. COULD LEGITIMATELY BE ACCUSED OF FAILING IN ITS DUTY
I THINK THAT'S FAIR TO SAY ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT HE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN KILLING FIFTY PEOPLE BY WALKING INTO A BAR THE CHALLENGES HIS EVEN THOUGH HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. SEVERAL TIMES NOTHING HE DID TO THE MOMENT OF WALKING INTO THAT BAR AND KILLING FIFTY PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE IS THE WHITE RATE THAT HE IS THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO BE ACTING THIS WAY IN THE NAME OF ISIS OR WHATEVER MOTIVATION HE CLAIMED WHEN HE CALLED INTO THAT NINE ONE ONE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KILLING SO IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THE F.B.I. SHOULD HAVE DONE SO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS DURING THE INTERVIEWS IF THERE WAS NOTHING THERE AT SOME STAGE THEY BECOME CUMULATIVE IF SOMEONE OVER TIME KEEPS GETTING EVER YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE SOMETHING'S GOING ON THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS WHERE'S HIS EMPLOYER AT THIS IS A PRIVATE SECURITY GUARD
WHO HAD ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITY COMPANY HAD FEDERAL CONTRACTS WERE THEY EVER ARE NOTIFIED OF THEIR CONCERTS SO I HAVE NO DOUBT COS IT HAPPENS IN EVERY CASE AT THE PIECES CAN BE PUT TOGETHER TO SHOW THAT HE IN FACT WAS EN ROUTE TO DOING SOMETHING AS BAD AS HE DID AND HE WAS ALSO A
PERFECTLY LEGALLY IT WOULD SEEM TO BUY YES A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE'D BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. BREAD IS THERE DO YOU THINK ANY CHANCE THAT THIS THREAT
CHANGES THINGS IN A WAY THAT ALL THE OTHER AWFUL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED WITH WITH GUNS AND PARTICULARLY WITH VERY POWERFUL GUNS HAVEN'T SADLY NO I MEAN I THOUGHT THAT SANDY HOOK WOULD BE THE MOMENT THAT MAN WALKS IN TO EIGHT HAD AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND KILLS FIVE AND SIX YEAR OLDS OVER TWENTY OF THEM ARE NEWS IN YOU SIT THERE AND YOU'RE THINKING OH KAY THIS IS THIS IS FINALLY AT THIS IS THE THING THAT'S GOING TO MAKE US WAKE UP BUT IT DID IT THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK ON GAY PEOPLE IN A CLUB WHEN YOU WERE
IN GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT THESE THREATS WHAT WAS THAT A PARTICULAR ISSUE SHOULD IT BE A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT CONCERNS MORE BROADLY IT WAS IF YOU COMPARE IT TO SAY SYNAGOGUES OR SEE A SPORTING A VET SO THEY WERE ALWAYS AREAS THAT WE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR GAY BARS YOU KNOW YOU WORRIED ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST
A RIGHT WING VIOLENCE BUT NEVER AS RELATED TO ISIS EVEN THOUGH WE ALL KNOW THAT ISIS VIEWS THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY AS WERE THE DEATH BUT I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BECAUSE I DO FEAR THAT IN THIS NARRATIVE OF ISIS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ADVERTISED ICE AS WE ARE FORGETTING THAT THIS WAS AN ATTACK AGAINST A SPECIFIC COMMUNITY THAT SHOULD BE LAST IN THE MIRROR
THAT WAS JULIA CHI I AM A FORMER HOME AND SECURITY ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO THE FLORIDA SENATOR FORMER CANDIDATE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT MARK A RUBY
A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY IT'S THE SINGLE LARGEST LOSS OF LIFE IT HAD THE GUNFIRE AND AMERICAN
TERRORIST ATTACK I HAD ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL INSPIRED
DIRECTIVE I THINK PARTLY INSPIRED BY ISIS ONLINE
FIFTY PEOPLE MASTER LIVES ANOTHER FIFTY OR SO WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES
AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT A NATION CAN DO TO PROTECT ITSELF
I MEAN THE WHOLE RUN BY AN EXTREMIST AS THE HARDEST OF ALL BECAUSE THAT SOMEONE WHO OFTENTIMES THEY IN TRAVEL THE BRIDE
BUT A PART OF A LARGE PART THEY'RE JUST INDIVIDUALS AT A RADICALISED AND INSPIRED TO TAKE ACTION AT ALL
GO OUT AND FIND A PLACE LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU SEE IT ONLINE AND THE BEAT MAGAZINE THAT'S PUT UP THEY TELL FIND NIGHTCLUBS FIND MARS FIND SCORES FIND PART
DRIVE YOUR CAR THROUGH A CROWDED KILL PEOPLE WHAT SHE SHOOT HIM THIS IS THE STUFFED INSPIRED TO DO AND IT'S THE HARDEST
TARGET WE'VE EVER HAD NOW HISTORY IS THE HOME GROUND I'M AN EXTREMIST AND WE'VE HAD THE PRESIDENT SAYING WE HAVE TO LOOK AGAIN
GUN CONTROL OF THE ISSUE OF HOW EASY IT IS TO GET ALL OF THESE LETHAL WEAPONS LIKE ASSAULT RIFLES WHICH SURELY HAD NO PLACE
THAT THE BEETLE GO ON BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE PREVENTED THIS ATTACK HE WOULD ABOUT EUROPE IN THEIR PARENTS' ATTACKS WHERE THESE GUNS ARE ILLEGAL HONEST NOT VERY MUCH
THE BOTTOM FROM THE BLACK MARKET COULD'VE DONE LIKE BOSTON AND DETONATED THE BOMB COULD HAVE LOADED IS STRAPPED UP WITH EXPLOSIVES AND DRIVEN IT INTO THE BUILDING
THIS IS TERRACE YOU COMMITTED PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO UNFORTUNATELY
I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS LESS ON THE WEAPON THEY USED THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT WHICH IS A RADICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE
AND WHAT ABOUT OBVIOUSLY FROM THE OTHER SIDE THE DOUBLE TRUMP ARGUMENT BUT YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL LET'S NOT LET ANY MORE MUSLIMS INTO THE COUNTRY
HE WAS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES HE WAS RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY HE LIVED AMONG ELSIE SEE WHAT JOBS HERE
PERSON WHO BENEFIT FROM ALL THE FREEDOMS AND THE PROSPERITY OF THIS VERY COUNTRY
DESPITE ALL THAT WAS RADICALISED
THE LIFE OF FIFTY OF HIS FELLOW AMERICANS
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IT'S A REAL THREAT AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR AMERICA SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY ON
THE PROPAGANDA EDUCATION ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THE RED PERIL
DO YOU THINK THAT THE WEST HAS DONE ENOUGH TO
THE POTENCY OF THE THREAT
RADICAL ISLAM REQUIRED ANOTHER WIDOW ENOUGH IT'S STILL DIFFICULT ULTIMATELY I THINK THE RESPONSIBILITY OF REJECTING THIS IDEOLOGY HAS TO COME FROM THE ISLAMIC WORLD ITSELF IN THE VILLA MUST AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS ON THIS PLANET DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THIS MAN DID IT WITH THAT IDEA
BUT IF ONE PER CENT OF THEM DO THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO CONDUCT THIS ONE OF THE TAG SO I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON IT BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE ONE COMMUNITY ACROSS
TO REJECT THIS IDEOLOGY IS IN THERE
THERE WAS MARK REVERE THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR TALKING TO NORTH AMERICA TO JOHNSON
TWENTY PAST EIGHT BRITAIN MUST NOT LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT MUST LEAD IT THAT'S WHAT GORDON BROWN IS GOING TO SAY IN A SPEECH TODAY AN IMPORTANT SPEECH IF IT'S TRUE AS MANY BELIEVE THAT THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN IS NOT GETTING ITS MESSAGE ACROSS TO ENOUGH LABOUR VOTERS I HOPE THAT IS IN OUR RADIO CAR AT THE AIRPORT AS WE SPEAK I AM INDEED I AM INDEED GOOD GOOD MORNING TO YOU IS FOR JOINING US
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE SLIGHTLY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THIS IDEA OF BRITAIN LEADING THE EUROPEAN YOU WHEN THEY LOOK AT A RECORD OR RATHER SEMI DETACHED REMOTE THEY WE DIDN'T JOIN THE EURO WE DIDN'T JOIN SHOWING AND WE GOT OPT OUT IN ALL SORTS OF TERRIBLY IMPORTANT AREAS WASTE ALL OF THAT CHANGE NOW
JOHN LOOK AT THE SWEEP OF HISTORY BRITAIN LED EUROPE AGAINST FASCISM BRITAIN CREATED THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BRITAIN WAS THE LEADER AND PERSUADING EASTERN EUROPE TO COME INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION BRITAIN HAS ALWAYS LED THE WAY WOULDN'T THINGS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT IN EUROPE AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE WERE A LEADER AGAIN AND I TALK TO EUROPEAN LEADERS OR THE TANK THEY WANT BRITAIN TO BE A LEADER IN EUROPE AND SO THE AGENDA THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD TODAY ONE BUT I THINK CONSERVATIVES COULD ACCEPT BUT IT'S A LABOUR AGENDA THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD
LET US LEAD IN THE U.K. PRESIDENCY IN THE BATTLE FOR JOBS I THINK WE COULD CREATE HALF A MILLION JOBS BY REFORM OF THE SINGLE MARKET JOBS FOR BRITAIN LED AS A READER IN AN ENERGY CO ORDINATION WHICH COULD AGAIN USE WIND AND WAVE POWER SO THAT WE CAN GET ENERGY BILLS DOWN LET'S LEAD AND TACKLING TAX HAVENS ONLY EUROPE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT LET'S LEAD ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO COORDINATED ACTION AGAINST TERRORISM
BECAUSE AGAIN BRITAIN HAS GOT THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES THAT THE BEST IN EUROPE AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH OUR EUROPEAN PARTNERS WERE DEALING WITH CROSS BORDER TOURISM WE NEED CROSS BORDER CO OPERATION TURNED AGAIN EUROPE EUROPE CAN BE LED BY A BRITISH GOVERNMENT WAS DETERMINED TO PAY ITS FOR PART AND MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT'S A LOVELY WISH LIST
LIKE ALL THAT TO BE THE CASE BUT WE CAN READ THE MORE RECENT HISTORY BOOKS AND THAT SHOWS US THAT OUR INFLUENCE IN EUROPE HAS BEEN MINIMAL IF NOT IGNORED ALTOGETHER OUR MONEY I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE I THINK WHEN IT CAME TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL RECESSION BRITAIN LED EUROPE AND EUROPE LED THE WORLD I THINK ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE TREATY BRITAIN LED IN EUROPE AND EUROPE HAS LED THE WORLD IN GETTING UP WE CAN DO THAT OUTSIDE AS WELL
NO I DON'T THINK SO NORWAY SWITZERLAND OUTSIDE EUROPE RECOVERED A FAX DEMOCRACY THEY RECEIVE THEIR DECISIONS FROM EUROPE AND THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THEM YOU'VE GOT TO BE AT THE TABLE YOU'VE GOT TO BE A NEGOTIATOR I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND YOU SEE I THINK THE BRITISH PEOPLE'S PATRIOTISM AS THIS WE WANT TO BE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE WILL BE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY IF WE ARE LEADING IN EUROPE NOT ISOLATED NOT ON THE SIDELINES NOT SENDING FLOTILLAS UP THE THAMES AS A DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH AS WE'RE GOING TO SEE HER
ON WEDNESDAY BUT ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN THE WORLD OUT THERE LEADING WITH PROPOSALS SHOWING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER AND YOU KNOW THE LABOUR VOTERS THAT I TALKED TO THEY DON'T LIKE THE STATUS QUO THEY DON'T LIKE WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT THEY WANT TO SEE THINGS CHANGED THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF COURSE THAT I CAN PUT I TELL YOU WHAT A LOT OF THOSE LABOUR VOTERS DON'T LIKE EITHER
AND THAT IS IMMIGRATION AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DID NOT INCLUDE IN THAT LIST AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JEREMY CAUGHT IN THE DOCUMENT ACTUALLY HAS A PET IN THE DOCUMENT DRAWER I DON'T IF YOU'VE READ THE DOC YOU KNOW DO YOU NO NO NO YOU JUST YOU JUST GAVE ME A WEE LIST THERE UNDER AND IT WASN'T IN THAT LIST THAT THAT'S ALL I DON'T KNOW I WAS I WAS I WAS I WAS SUMMARISING BREATHIN ALL RIGHT WELL LET ME JUST EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN THE DOCUMENTS TELL LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT AN OPERATION SPECIFIC YOU KNOW IF IF I MADE THEM A LOT TELL YOU WHAT'S IN THERE DONE WELL BY ALL MEANS TOMMY WHAT'S IN THE DOCUMENT ABOUT IMMIGRATION IF WE COULD DEAL WITH THAT FIRST
THAT IS NO DO YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL AS WELL AS I DO IT NOT BETTER THAT PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY AND SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT IMMIGRATION THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE THEY BELIEVE COMING FROM EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES WOULD HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DO SO IN BEING ABLE TO SETTLE HERE ON THE FIGURES THE PROJECTION SHOW THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO COME AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL TWO HUNDRED TH WELL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND IF YOU BELIEVE THE LATEST MIGRATION WATCH BECAUSE A YEAR
WHAT WOULD JOHN IN THE DOCUMENT WE ACTUALLY SAY WE'VE GOT TO HELP COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT BY RISING LEVELS OF POPULATION WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP THEM WITH THE HEALTH SERVICE AND WITH SCHOOLS AND WITH THE PROVISION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES WE THINK EUROPE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS WELL AS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE TOMORROW IT COULD BE DONE BY A BRITISH KEEP THE PIGLET
AND THEN LOOK AT THE ISSUE AS AS AS A WHOLE NORWAY OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A HIGHER RATE OF MIGRATION SWITZERLAND OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A HIGHER RATE OF IMMIGRATION IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL FIGURES THEMSELVES THEN WHAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE PEOPLE WHO YOU CLASSIFY AS EUROPEANS COMING TO BRITAIN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF OUR IRISH CITIZEN NOBODY WANTS TO EXCLUDE THE IRISH CITIZENS FROM THE REAL PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING WITH AND THIS IS AGAIN IN THE DOCUMENT
AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WHEN YOU SAW THESE ALBANIANS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY THAT WASN'T EUROPEANS TRYING TO GET IN BY WHITE THAT WAS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DRIVEN BY GANGMASTERS DRIVEN BY TRAFFICKERS CRIMINAL GANGS THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT WHICH IS A CROSS BUT IT'S ALL RUMBLE ON ORDER BUT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS BY CO OPERATION ACROSS THE AUTHORITIES IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE IN MIGRATION WHICH IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
AND I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS I THINKS WILL BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT BY QUITE WELL COURSE AUTHORITIES MURPH U.S.P. IF YOU ASK PEOPLE IN THE OPINION POLLS TO DO WANT CO OPERATION TO DEAL WITH THE SECURITY ISSUES THE ULCER YES EUROSCEPTICS AND WERE FILES THE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO SAY THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG GIVEN THAT YOUR YOUR GOVERNMENT'S RECORD ON NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM THE ACCESSION COUNTRIES FOR INSTANCE WHAT JOHN SAID
JOHN HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME TO BRITAIN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FROM ROMANIA AND BULGARIA CAN YOU TELL ME WELL I'VE GOT ALL ALONE YOU RAISE IT ALL THE TIME I HAVE I HAVE LOSE THIRTY IT WAS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND HOW MANY CAME IN TWO THOUSAND IT NINE IT WAS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AS I'VE JUST SAID THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IRISH AND BRITAIN AND WELCOME TO BE IN BRITAIN YOU MUST NOT GET THESE FIGURES YOU'RE NOT A SPECTRE YOUR PROJECTIONS WERE FOURTEEN FUN
AND THAT IS ENTIRELY UNDREDS UPPING I CAN GET YOU ALL THE FIGURES IF YOU LIKE I'VE GOT A MORE AS IT HAPPENS IN FRONT OF ME BUT I'M GLAD I'M GLAD YOU DO BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE CONFIRMED BUT THE ACTUAL FIGURE WAS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND AND WITH GENTLE OR THEORY DINNERTIME
THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THAT WAS ROMANIA AND BULGARIA TAKING TOGETHER AND LET US ALSO REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD TO BE AUTHORISED THEY HAD TO GET A PERMIT TO WORK IT WASN'T UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION AND YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT THE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND IS A VERY VERY SMALL PROPORTION I THINK SORRY BUT NOT A BOOK BUT LET'S PICK UP ON THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ACCESSION COUNTRIES AREN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE FIGURES PROJECTED OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IN THE CASE OF MIGRATION WATCH AND IF YOU LOOK AT OXFORD OBSERVATORY COME ON JOHN COME ON JOHN ANYBODY CAN PRODUCE FIGURES TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE REAL WORLD OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S MIGRATION OBSERVATORY HAVE COME UP WITH THEIR OWN FIGURES LEVELLING OFF AT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS TALKS IN TERMS OF A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND WHAT ARE YOUR FIGURES WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN
I BELIEVE THAT IN BRITAIN WE HAVE MANAGED MIGRATION IT'S NOT UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND AFTER ALL AMERICA SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HOW MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GIVE US I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY I WAS THINKING THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER LEVEL OF BORDER CONTROL YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW HOW THE POLICE THING'S GOING TO WORK WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE BOATS IN THE CHANNEL TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND THEN WHICH OF THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT HAVE GOT TO BE TAKEN INTO THE REALITY IS THAT YOUR YOUR SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL AND YOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WELCOME IMMIGRATION THEY THINK IT IS A JOLLY GOOD THING FOR THIS COUNTRY THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AT ALL
BUT HOLD ON JOHN ARE YOU SAYING THERE ARE NO BENEFITS TO IMMIGRATION AND I WOULD QUESTION WHAT I'M DOING AT THE DOCTOR'S AND OUR HOSPITAL THE NURSES IN THE HEALTH SERVICE RIGHT SO YOU'RE WELCOME ARTERIES AND THERE ARE SKILLED PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM COMPANIES ARE DESPERATE TO EMPLOY AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF MANAGED MIGRATION RATHER LIKE THE AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NON E.U. MIGRANTS SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THE COUNTRY
BUT OF COURSE WHERE THERE ARE PRESSURES WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES WHO FEEL THAT THE PRESSURE'S ON THEM ON THE HEALTH SERVICE AND POLICING ARE INTENSE AND HE SHOULD BE DOING MORE AND HAVE TO DO MORE ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION FOR TROUBLE IT'S FROM WILL FROM THE LABOUR PARTY'S POINT HIM
AS WELL AS WHEN GILLIAN DUFFY YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT NAME OF COURSE WHEN SHE RAISED IT WITH YOU IN THE JOHN I REALLY EXPECTED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU ALL ABOUT IMMIGRATION BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WERE AT FAIR ENOUGH I'M QUITE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT MISSUS DUFFY AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE REASON BECAUSE YOU'RE SO IN EUROPEAN UNION THE REASON THE REASON I RAISED BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE REASON I RAISED IT IS BECAUSE YOU AT THE TIME DESCRIBED AS A BIGOTED WOMAN WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS SOME SENSE FROM YOU AS INDEED I HAVE FOR HER MOTHER
FIGURES IN THIS DEBATE AS TO YOUR OVERALL ATTITUDE TO IMMIGRATION DO YOU THINK LET ME PUT A NICE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION COS IT'S A HUGE ISSUE FOR MANY PEOPLE AS YOU KNOW STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE LEVELS AT THE MOMENT ARE ABOUT RIGHT OR THAT WE SHOULD LET'S PUT ASIDE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WERE ALL OPPOSED NOT TAUGHT TO PUT ASIDE A LITTLE NO NO I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU WANT TO FLATTEN THAT IS THE HEART OF NO IT ISN'T A PROBLEM IF YOU DON'T IT IS JOHN
IF YOU TALK TO AN AMERICAN IF YOU DOCTOR AN INDIAN IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN EUROPE IT IS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE MOST WORRIED ABOUT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES ELEVEN MILLION INDIA TWENTY MILLION AND WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BY CO OPERATION AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WORKING WITH THE OTHER EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES SO YOU CAN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FUTURE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DON'T HAVE COORDINATED ACTION ACROSS EUROPE SECURITY SERVICES MILITARY DIPLOMATIC POLICING INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
WORKING TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THAT LOOKS AT THIS QUESTION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS ANY DOUBT THAT YOU NEED SYSTEMATIC CO OPERATION ACROSS EUROPE YOU'VE YOU'VE ACCEPTED THAT LABOUR ISN'T PROPERLY GETTING ITS MESSAGE ACROSS IN THIS A REFERENDUM WHOSE FAULT IS THAT IT MUST BE PARTLY PRESUMABLY JEREMY CORBIN SPOT AND WHEN HE SAYS WHEN YOU ASK HIM WHERE HE IS ON HIS ENTHUSIASM SCALE ONE TO TEN HE SAYS WHAT ABOUT SEVEN
I THINK I THINK THAT WAS A COMEDY PROGRAMME IT WAS A COMEDY PROGRAMME PUT IT WAS YOU KNOW PUT IT JOHN DO YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY ODD THING TO DO AT THIS STAGE IN THE DEBATE WHERE BRITAIN'S FUTURE IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE IN MANY RESPECTS FOR THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY TO GO ON A COMEDY PROGRAMME AS OPPOSED TO MAKING A HUGELY IMPORTANT SPEECHES YOU'RE MAY DOING TODAY OFFAL OVER ME TO BE WATCHING THE EURO MATCHES LIFE HAS GOT TO GO ON AS WELL AND I'M WATCHING THE EURO MATCHES BUT I'M MAKING THE CASE AS JEREMY IS WITH THIS DOCUMENT TODAY SHOWING THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE AGENDA
YOU SEE LABOUR VOTERS DON'T LIKE THE STATUS QUO THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'VE GOT TO BE BETTER OFF WE CAN SHOW AND THE EUROPEAN LEADERS THAT I TALK TO WANT THIS TO HAPPEN THAT BRITAIN CAN LEAD IN EUROPE AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE MESSAGE THAT JEREMY KORBEN JOHN MCDONALD I WAS TALKING TO HIM YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS TOM WATSON THE DEPUTY LEADER PETER MANDELSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARTY OR PUTTING TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S SHOWS THAT WHEN ALL THE FORCES OF LABOUR GET TOGETHER IT'S A VERY POWERFUL VOICE IN THE COUNTRY GORDON BROWN MANY THANKS
THE TIME TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE ROB SEE THE SPOT IT'S JUST YOU KNOW AGAIN HER HEADLINES AS FOLLOWS NORTHERN IRELAND BEATEN ONE NIL BY POLAND IN THEIR FIRST MATCH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEN EXPLAIN UKRAINE WHO HAVE BEEN TO KNOW BY GERMANY REPUBLIC OF IRELAND PLAY SWEDEN TODAY ONE OF THREE MATCHES B.B.C.

SAYS THE GUNMAN WHO CARRIED OUT AMERICA'S DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING WAS INTERVIEWED THREE TIMES ABOUT SUSPECTED LINKS TO ISLAMIC TERRORISM BUT AGENTS DECIDED HE WASN'T A THREAT OBAMA TEAM KILLED FIFTY PEOPLE IN A GAY NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO HE PHONED THE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GREW
GORDON BROWN WILL TAKE CENTRE STAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TODAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO WIN LABOUR VOTERS TO THE REMAIN SIDE HE'LL USE A SPEECH TO ARGUE THAT THE Y. U. CAN BE REFORMED FROM WITHIN LEAF CAMPAIGNERS SAY THAT OPPORTUNITY HAS PASSED BUT MY BROWN TOLD US BRITAIN HAD LED THE WAY IN EUROPE IN THE PAST AND IT WAS TIME TO DO SO AGAIN
A STUDY HAS PREDICTED THE NET MIGRATION TO THE U.K. WILL EXCEED A QUARTER OF A MILLION EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF THE COUNTRY CHOOSES TO REMAIN IN THE E.U. MIGRATION WATCH WHICH CAMPAIGNS FOR THE LOWER IMMIGRATION SAID THERE WAS TOO MUCH COMPLACENCY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF RAPID POPULATION GROWTH
A SENTENCING HEARING FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN ATHLETE OSCAR PISTORIUS FOR THE MURDER OF HIS GIRLFRIEND REBUS AND CAMP WILL BEGIN IN PRETORIA SHORTLY HE FACES A JAIL TERM OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS
THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES TO NINE GORDON BROWN ON IMMIGRATION JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO SUGGESTING THE DOCTORS AND NURSES SKILLED PEOPLE WILL STILL BE NEEDED IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH PRESSURES IN INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES HE SAID DEAL WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT DON'T DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOOD FOR US IT IS GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY
LET US TALK TO DOCTOR LIAM FOX FORMER CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER LEAVE CAMPAIGNER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THERE IS OF COURSE THAT IMMIGRATION REPORT OUT FROM IMMIGRATION FROM AGGRESSION WASHED TODAY IT IS VERY MUCH GOING TO BE A SUBJECT THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT GORDON BROWN IS RIGHT IS KEY WHEN HE SAYS WE NEED
MIGRATION FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY GOING WE MAY OR MAY NOT REQUIRE MIGRATION CAN I JUST ASK YOU AND YOUR VIEW WE DO NEEDED AT THE MOMENT THAT IS INCONTROVERTIBLE ISN'T IT
WE MAY NEED MIGRATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY COME BUT NOT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IF THERE ARE SKILLS GAPS THEN WE MAY WANT TO FILL THEM FROM OVERSEAS SO WHERE WERE THE BRICKLAYERS COME FIVE WHAT INCOME FROM EUROPE THE QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE A CHOICE IN WHO COMES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM THE EXAMPLE THAT GORDON BROWN GAVE DOCTORS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WANTED TO TAKE HIS SKILLED SURGEON FOR AUSTRALIA
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO FILL THE POST FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PROCESS WE ARE OF COURSE HAVE A SYSTEM NO WITH FREE MOVEMENT WHERE ANYBODY WHO IS A CITIZEN OF THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN CHOOSE TO COME TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND
OUR LAWS I KNOW SKEWED IN FAVOUR OF THEN WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYMENT SO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER HIS WHO COMES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM THE THING ABOUT THE THE REFERENDUM DEBATE IS IS ABOUT GETTING CONTROL OVER THAT WE IF WE HAD A POINT SYSTEM LIKE THIS TRILLION SYSTEM WE COULD ACTUALLY DETERMINE
WHICH PEOPLE WITH THE SKILLS WHICH AND WHAT IT COULD COME TO BRITAIN WHICH WOULD COME TO BRITAIN BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT CONTROL WHILE WE'RE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING CONTROL OF THE PROCESS I UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND ACTUALLY THAT THE PRACTICAL FACT OF WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AND YOU ARE SAYING THAT SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY COME ACROSS AND FILL JOBS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION THOSE SAME JOBS COULD BE FILLED
WITH A KIND OF GOVERNMENT GETTING INVOLVED BY FILLING THEM FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE MY PROBLEM IT'S NOT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR MY PROBLEMS OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION WHO DON'T HAVE JOBS IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES GREAT WILL CHARITY HAVE THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SENSE THEY HAVE COMPLETE RIGHT TO COME TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
WHETHER THEY HAVE A JOB OR NOT AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A PUBLIC SERVICES AND THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE HEALTH SERVICE EDUCATION HOUSING LISTS AND SO ON AND THAT IS A PROBLEM AND HUGELY BENEFIT US IN THERE IN THERE DOING A BIT WELL THOSE WHO WERE
AND PRODUCE INCOME YES B. B. WHICH IS ONE OF THE ORATORY ISN'T BUT THEY MAY NOT SUGGESTING THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS TO THIS COUNTRY ARE ON BENEFITS COS THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME AND ACCESS OUR PUBLIC SERVICES WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS A SYSTEM BY SOLD O.K. LET ME TO BECOME A PAY TAXES IF THE BENEFIT THE ECONOMY WHAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT I WANT TO SEE
IS A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER BOTH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE COUNTRY AND CHOOSING WHICH PEOPLE COME TO THE COUNTRY WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST NON E.U. CITIZENS SO IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THOSE
COMING FROM THE COMMONWEALTH FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE WITH PARTICULAR SKILLS TO COME TO BRITAIN I WANT TO SYSTEM WITH BRITAIN
CAN DETERMINE WHO COMES TO THIS COUNTRY AND HOW MANY COME AND WE'VE GOT THE ADDED PROBLEM THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION MIGRATION WHAT'S SAID TODAY WERE TURKEY TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE MIGHT SEE A NEXT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR ON TOP OF THAT QUARTER MILLION COMING YEAH BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT FIGURES COS THEY DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
HE'S FORTY ONE YEARS SINCE WE LAST HAD A SAY ON OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FORTY ONE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ACCELERATING TURKISH MEMBERSHIP PLANS
THE THEY'RE ACCELERATING THESE IF WE TRAVEL WE KNOW WE'RE ALL OF THIS ENDS AND IT CAN ONLY STOP WHEN WE SAY WE ARE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION'S JURISDICTION ON THIS BRITAIN WILL DETERMINE WHO GETS INTO OUR OWN COUNTRY THAT'S ABOUT CONTROL
THESE ARE FREE TRAVEL HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THESE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE REPORTED DONE REVEALED IN THE SUNDAY TIMES OVER THE WEEKEND THAT SEEM JUST SHOWN SOME SORT OF DISCUSSIONS BEHIND THE SCENES ABOUT POTENTIALLY ALLOWING CERTAIN TURKISH PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF PASSPORT TO COME IN A BIT
WELL IT'S VERY MUCH AGAINST THE ASSURANCES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN US IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND AS A CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT I'M I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE THAT ON ONE HAND WE'RE BEING TOLD THESE FREEDOMS WILL NOT BE GRANTED
AND YET SECRETLY BEHIND OUR BACKS THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ONGOING APPARENTLY INSIDE THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE ABOUT ALLOWING THESE AND I THINK WE WILL WANT TO READ THESE QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND JUST GENERALLY WITH REGARD TO THE CAMPAIGN I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU BEFORE IT ALL KICKED OFF ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT CONSERVATIVES ATTACKING FELLOW CONSERVATIVES HAS IT GONE AS YOU EXPECTED BETTER WORSE SOMETHING HERE OF AMBER RUDD AND BORIS JOHNSON ET-CETERA
I THINK IT'S FAIR ENOUGH IN THE REFERENDUM THAT WE WILL PROBE ON ANOTHER'S VIEWS WE CAN SAY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT WE CAN SEE YOU'VE GOT YOUR FACTS WRONG WHAT I THINK IS UNACCEPTABLE IS FOR PEOPLE TO IMPUGN THE MOTIVES OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE HONESTY OF THE COLLEAGUES THAT'S HAPPENED I THINK THAT HAS HAPPENED AND I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE
SCARS LAST WELL BEYOND THE REFERENDUM DATE ITSELF YOU THINK THEY WILL NOW THEY SCAR I THINK IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY WENT AFTER THE AT THE END OF THE DEBATE PEOPLE JUST PICK UP AND CARRY ON PARTICULAR IF WE REMAIN AND BE FORGOTTEN AND THOSE WHO STILL CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS WILL BE QUITE ISOLATED I THINK THAT HOW DIFFICULT OR HOW EASY THE PROCESS WILL BE AFTER THE REFERENDUM WAS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON HOW WELL WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM AND MY ADVICE EVERYBODY'S TAKE A DEEP BREATH
STICK TO THE ISSUES DON'T MAKE PERSONAL ATTACKS IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND IN HER CASE I THINK IT TURNS THE VOTERS OFF THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE THEY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE RELAUNCH TODAY OUT OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN AND ANY CAMPING THAT'S HAD TO HAVE A RELAUNCH MY VIEW IS HIS FEELING
LIAM FOX THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE MORE THAN EIGHTY STATE SCHOOLS INCLUDING FORTY PRIMARIES HAVE INTRODUCED WHAT THEY CALLED GENDER NEUTRAL UNIFORMS MEANS A BOY WANTS TO WEAR A SKIRT YOU CAN DO SO IF A GIRL WANTS TO WEAR TROUSERS THAT'S FINE TO THE FIGURE COMES ON THE CHARITY EDUCATING CELEBRATE WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BY THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION AS PART OF A PROJECT TO ADDRESS HOMOPHOBIC BY BEGAN TRENDS PHOBIC BULLYING I'M GOING
ON THE LINE BY ANDREW WILLIAMS WHO RUNS THE CHARITY CHRISTIAN CONCERN AND BY JAMIE BURIED HIS HEAD TEACHER AT PARSONS STREET PRIMARY IN BRISTOL AND HE HAS PUT THIS POLICY IN PLACE MY BIKE ASK YOU FIRST HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE YOU COME ACROSS DURING YOUR YEARS AS A HEAD TEACHER AND YOU HAD THIS IN IN PREVIOUS SCHOOLS AS WELL THIS POLICY DIDN'T YOU WHO ARE GENUINELY
CONCERNED ABOUT PUZZLED ABOUT WORRIED ABOUT THEIR GENDER
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I'VE PERSONALLY COME ACROSS ANY CHILDREN SHOW A CONCERN OR WORRY OR CONFUSION HOWEVER I RECOGNISE THAT CHILDREN MAY NOT ALWAYS REALISE OR UNDERSTAND THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AT AN EARLY AGE SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A POLICY THAT CREATES A CULTURE OF ACCEPTANCE AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE INTRODUCED THE POLICY PASSED THE STREET SCHOOL BECAUSE AS OUR CHILDREN GROW UP WE WANT THEM TO KNOW IT'S O.K. TO EXPRESS YOURSELF OR BE WHO YOU ARE
BUT YOU'VE NOT COME ACROSS ANY CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY AND YOU'VE BEEN HEAD TEACHER QUITE A LONG TIME WHO ACTUALLY EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN SO FAR NOT EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THEIR GENDER BUT I HAVE COME ACROSS CHILDREN WHO WHEN THEY WANTED TO WEAR TROUSERS I'VE BEEN TOLD THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE FOR BOYS AND THAT'S JUST A BIT SILLY REALLY ISN'T IT THAT DOES THAT NEED A GOVERNMENT POLICY DOES IT NEED A POLICY IN WHICH A SCHOOL SAYS
TWO CHILDREN EFFECTIVELY YOU MAY BE A BOY OR YOU MAY BE A GIRL IT'S EVER IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS POLICY IS DOING ISN'T IT
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S THAT'S ALL IT IS IT'S A POLICY THAT'S ALL IT IS THAT'S ON THAT'S RATHER A LOT THAT'S A BIG THING TO SAY TO A CHILD IT WELL YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE GIRL AND YOU SAY ACTUALLY YOU MAY BE A BOY RATHER BE A BOY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE POLICY SAYS IT'S ALL WHAT THE POLICY DOES IS IT DOESN'T STIPULATE AGENDA BY AN ITEM OF CLOTHING SO IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE THE POLICY ANY MORE THAN WHAT IT IS SIMPLY A POLICY WHICH DOESN'T DEFINE GENDER BUY ITEMS OF CLAIRE AND ANDREW WILLIAMS I DO AGREE WITH IT ON THAT BASIS
I THINK THE LOOK BUT WHAT JAMIE'S BEEN SPEAKING OF THERE THAT IN HIS EXPERIENCE HE'S NEVER REALLY HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION AND THESE KIND OF POLICIES THAT ARE CUNT COMING OUT ACTUALLY COULD BE VERY HARMFUL POTENTIALLY THE IMPOSITION OF A KIND OF RADICAL IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA OF ADULTS IMPOSED ON THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDREN WHILE HE'S UP BUT HIS MATES SAYING SPECIFICALLY ISN'T THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE JUST SAYING TO HER TO THE KIDS IF YOU WANT OR WERE
HER TROUSERS ARE VIGOROUS GOOD VIEW ABOARD THAT'S O.K. I THINK THAT GENERALLY WE KNOW THAT BOYS AND GIRLS THEY RECOGNISE THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND IT WOULD BE GENERALLY UNUSUAL FOR BOYS TO BE WEARING SKIRTS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL SINCE WELL I THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU BEGIN TO BE LIVING COMMUNITY WITH ONE L. WITH ONE ANOTHER
A SCHOOL WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OTHER CHILDREN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS BUT ACTUALLY HOW WE GROW COMMUNITIES AND I THINK EDUCATORS ARE THEY'RE ALL MORE BUT WHAT WERE THEY TO DO AS EDUCATORS OF OUR CHILDREN IS TO LOOK AFTER THEM TO HELP THEM TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS THEIR REALITY THEY'RE BORN I EITHER MALE OR FEMALE TO ACTUALLY CELEBRATE THAT WONDERFUL DIFFERENCE OR A TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH
PRIMARY SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN AND ALL CHILDREN GENERALLY THEN WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS HELPING THEM TO BE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE BOYS OR GIRLS THE GENDER INTO WHICH THEY ARE BORN THAT THAT'S A POINT MANY PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH MY BY THE GERMAN INTO WHICH THEY ARE BORN
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S AS CLEAR CUT AS THAT IT'S IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY CHILDREN BORN INTO MALE OR FEMALE GENDER WHAT IS THE REALITY ISN'T IT NOT THE MODERN WAY AS IF YOU'RE BORN WITH CERTAIN ORGANS YOU'RE A BOY IF YOU'RE BORN WITH THAT OTHER ORGANS YOU'RE A GIRL AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN WITH ORGANS FROM BOTH SEXES UNUSUAL ISN'T IT AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT
AS UNUSUAL AS IT MAY BE IMPORTANT WE PREPARE OUR CHILDREN FOR THE WORLD THAT THEY LIVE IN AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN ALONGSIDE THE POLICIES WE TEACH THEM THE CURRICULUM WHICH IS ABOUT EQUALITY AND THEY'RE A PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS WHICH INCLUDES SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY AND IT'S IMPORTANT THE CHILDREN GROW UP UNDERSTANDING THAT NOT EVERYTHING FITS NEATLY INTO THE BOXES ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THIS WILLIAMS THAT THAT YOU ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT OLD FASHIONED ABOUT THIS YOU'D LIKE THINGS TO BE AS THEY ALWAYS WERE RUN
SOCIETY STRANGER I THINK HER QUALITY IS NOT ABOUT ALWAYS WERE EVERYONE BEING THE SAME OR BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY BUT AS THEY MIGHT THINK THEY WANT TO IDENTIFY BUT RATHER ABOUT DEALING WITH THE BEAUTY OF A REALITY WHICH IS BUT IT ISN'T A REALITY WHICH IS WHICH IS WHICH IS WHICH IS DIFFERENT AND WHAT WE AND WHERE WHERE IN THERE A HIGHLY UNUSUAL CASES THEN THE KIND THING TO DO
FOR A LITTLE FOR A CHILD THAT'S CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR GENDER IS TO HELP THEM TO LIVE IN THE CHANGE IN WHICH THEY'RE BORN THAT'S THE KINDEST THING THAT WE AS ADULTS AS EDUCATORS CAN DO IF THEY'VE GOT ANY CHARLIE CARDIFF THEY REALLY CANNOT ACCEPT IF IT CAUSES THEM REAL ANGUISH
SHOULD TOOTH WE DO HAVE TO CONFORM TO BEING A GIRL WHEN THEY DESPERATELY FEEL THEY'RE A BOY FOR INSTANCE I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO THERE WHAT PARENT WOULD NEED TO DO AND WHAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WOULD NEED TO DO IS REALLY
LOOK TO HELP THAT CHILD LIVE IN THE GENT INTO WHICH THEY WERE BORN THAT'S THE KINDEST THING THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY DO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH ANDREW WILLIAMS AND JAMIE BARRIE
TIME ELEVEN MINUTES NINE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT EUROPE FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THE DEATHS REMEDY THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LACES AND UPDATES ON THE AIR A REFERENDUM DEBATE FROM AROUND THE NATION AND TOM HAS BEEN TALKING TO US FROM CAMBRIDGE THIS MORNING AND HE'S THERE AGAIN
YES GOOD MORNING FROM CAMBRIDGE SEES WHERE I'VE COME INSIDE SENATE HOUSE TO THE RARIFIED ATMOSPHERE OF THE WOOD PANELLED BOOK LINED OFFICES OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR PROFESSOR SO LEISURE OR A SAVIOUR
DOESN'T REALLY GET MUCH MORE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT THAN THIS WE'VE GOT THE PORTRAITS OF VICE CHANCELLOR'S STARING DOWN GLOWERING DOWN AT ME AND OF COURSE THE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT HAS COME OUT EMPHATICALLY IN FAVOUR OF REMAINING IN THE Y. YOU WE'VE HAD A SHEAF OF LETTERS TO THE EDITOR THERE FROM DAMES DON'S KNIGHTS NOBLE LAUREATE SO ALL AROUND THE CITY AND ELSEWHERE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND SOME EFFECT YOU SIGN ONE OF THOSE BACK IN FEBRUARY WHAT WAS THE POINT YOU WERE TRYING TO
THE POINT IS IS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS EMPHATICALLY IMPORTANT FOR BRITISH SCIENCE IT'S IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING AND REMEMBER WE BRING BACK MUCH MORE THAN WE ACTUALLY SEND OUT AND SECONDLY ABOUT THE COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF THAT FUNDING WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT MAJOR COLLABORATIONS IN RESEARCH
LET'S ALSO NOT DELUDE OURSELVES WHAT THIS RESEARCH IS ABOUT THIS IS NOT AIRY FAIRY RESEARCH THIS IS ABOUT CURES FOR CANCER CURES FOR DEMENTIA MAJOR NEW PROJECTS THAT ARE IN EUROPE BETTER ENERGY SUPPLIES THESE ARE REAL
PROJECTS WHICH ACTUALLY WILL AFFECT REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AND COLLABORATION THAT ENABLES THAT TO HAPPEN YOU MENTIONED THE FUNDING THE MONEY THERE AND OF COURSE I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GOING TO DENY THAT WE ARE A NET BENEFICIARY WE GET OUT MORE THAN WE PAID IAN BUT IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK IT ADDS UP TO ABOUT THREE PER CENT OF OVERALL R. AND THE SPENDING IN TERMS OF THESE PROGRAMMES THAT WE'RE INVESTED IN AND OF COURSE
YOU COULD TAKE PART IN THOSE PROGRAMMES THINGS LIKE S. P. SEVEN AND HORIZON TWENTY TWENTY ARE OPEN TO OTHER COUNTRIES OPEN TO TUNISIA ISRAEL ICELAND NORWAY SWEET SWITZERLAND THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE COUNTRIES AND ASSAULT OF COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET A VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE BEING INSIDE
FIRSTLY BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ENABLES US TO SET THE AGENDAS AND SECONDLY IT ENABLES US TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REGULATOR ENVIRONMENT WHICH IF WE WERE OUTSIDE WE NO LONGER HAVE A SAY YET WE HAVE TO COMPLY
AND THIRDLY YOU'VE CITED SOME COUNTRYSIDE SITE YOU ANOTHER ONE AND THAT'S SWITZERLAND AFTER BRITAIN PER CAPITA PROBABLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL COUNTRY IN TERMS OF RESEARCH BECAUSE OF A REFERENDUM HELD IN SWITZERLAND TO REDUCE MIGRATION INTO SWITZERLAND IN OTHER WORDS THAT THERE'S NO FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT SCIENTISTS IN THAT COUNTRY ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT IN FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR EVEN THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE
FINANCIALLY TO THE EUROPEAN PROGRAMMES THEY MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM THOSE PROGRAMMES THEY ALREADY HAVE BEEN FOR PERIODS OF TIME SO THIS IS SERIOUS AND IT REALLY MATTERS TO OUR RESEARCHERS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO PROGRAMMES THAT WILL AFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVES
YOU MENTION COLLABORATION AND CLEARLY COLLABORATION IS VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT COULDN'T WE COLLABORATE ON A GLOBAL SCALE BECAUSE WE'RE EXCLUDED
AMERICA INDIA CHINA AT THE MOMENT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SCIENTISTS HERE BUT IT'S HARDER FOR THEM THAN IT IS FOR HER FOR A FRENCH ACADEMIC OR A GERMAN HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW A DUTCH SCIENTIST TO COME HERE TO CAMBRIDGE TO TAKE PART IN IN IN THIS UNIVERSITY'S GREAT RESEARCH
THIS UNIVERSITY IS A TOTALLY INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY AND WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHO PARTICIPATE HERE IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COME AND SUPPORT OUR PROGRAMMES FACT THERE ARE AS MANY AS THERE ARE FROM WITHIN THE E.U. SO I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE FACT AT THE PRESENT TIME
THE COLLABORATIVE PAPERS THE INTERNATIONALLY AUTHORED PAPERS SIXTY PER CENT OF THE COLLABORATORS ARE FROM WITHIN THE Y. YOU WERE IN A CHANGING WORLD AND EUROPE AS A MAJOR PLAYER
THE LEISURE OR A SAVAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TOM THANK YOU THE TYPE SEVEN WITH US TONIGHT A DEEPLY DISTURBED MAN WALKS INTO A SHOP BUYS A POWERFUL ASSAULT RIFLE AND A SMALL MOUNTAIN OF AMMUNITION REDUCES IT TO MURDERERS MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE AS HE CAN THE FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB ON SATURDAY NIGHT WAS JUST THE LATEST IN A SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING SERIES OF HORRIFIC ATTACKS OF THE UNITED STATES FIFTY DEAD EVEN MORE INJURED
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE ASKED THIS QUESTION WHY DOESN'T AMERICA DO SOMETHING ABOUT ITS GUNNELS WELL WITH A DRESS THAT AGAIN IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST HERE ARE SOME CALLERS TO PRIDE RADIAL ORLANDO THEY TOLD THEIR HOST JOHNNY MAGIC EXCUSE ME ABOUT HOW THEY HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE SHOOTING'S MY FRIEND WOULDN'T MERIT LIKE ME SHE GOT OUT AND SHOOT BYE
IF YOU'VE MADE IT ONE OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND INTO THANK YOU KNOW THAT
THE WAY I DON'T BOTHER YOU START THE SOONER YOU KNOW BERNICE HALLO
I DON'T WE'RE GOING TO PLAN AT NIGHT BUT THEY KNOW THE BARTENDER AND A COUPLE OF DANCES
WHAT BENT AND
MELISSA HELLO NO DON'T YOU HAVE A FRIEND THAT WAS INJURED LAST NIGHT YEAH
I IT'S O.K. IT'S O.K. IT'S O.K. NO NO NO
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY HER DOCTOR HELP A HAYES WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF REPUBLICANS ABROAD JAMES RUBIN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON DOCTOR HELP A HAZE YOUR REACTION OBVIOUSLY THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE A REACTION TO THIS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE WHAT SHOULD AMERICA SEE BE SEEING TO ITSELF THIS MORNING
I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME OUT AND SAID IT WAS A TERROR ATTACK AND ATTACK OF HATE IT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMPLICATES LOOKING AT IT IS THAT HE WAS A SECURITY GUARD AND HE PERMITS TO HAVE DANCE
AND HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WELL IT WAS HIS JOB IT IS AND IT'S A SECULAR MEN THEN AND IT'S A LONG AND HE WAS IN A PROFESSION THAT REQUIRED THAT HE HAD TO HAVE IT BUT HE'D GONE INTO A SHOP AND BOUGHT THAT PARTICULAR ASSAULT RIFLE THAT HE USED IN THIS ATTACK ONLY I THINK ABOUT TEN DAYS EARLIER WELL IF SHE HAS PERMISSION TO KERRY
HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT WAS IT O.K. THAT HE WENT WAS ABLE TO GO INTO A SHOP AND JUST BUY A WEAPON OR YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE GUNS OFF THE STREET FROM GANGS AND FROM THOSE WHO ARE NOT MENTALLY WELL
IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA THERE WAS A PROJECT EXILE AND THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU USED TO GO AND IT WAS A FELON YOU WERE PROSECUTED FIVE YEARS NO PAROLE NO EARLY RELEASE AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL THEY DO YOU CREASED MURDERS BY SIXTY PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS THEY TOOK THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ON THORNS OFF THE STREET WE NEED TO HAVE MORE THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH HER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL AS THAT THEY ARE
I THINK THAT'S NOT REALLY THE QUESTION THIS ATTACK IS A AN AMALGAMATION OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM OF HATE AGAINST GAYS AND A MAN WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL
AH BUT THEY'RE HIS ABILITY TO KILL FIFTY PEOPLE AND AND MAIN FIFTY OTHERS IS ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE AN AUTOMATIC STYLE WEAPON
AND THAT'S WHERE THE LINE I'LL BE DRAWN WERE ALL FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT I'M FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT SPEAKS OF THE WRITER BERYL CORRECT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A GUN FOR SELF DEFENCE EVEN A HANDGUN
AND HAVING AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON IT'S THE AUTOMATIC WEAPON THEIR TERMS THIS I HATE CRIME THIS ACT OF TERRORISM FROM A SMALL SCALE ATTACK TO AN ACT OF MASS MURDER OF THE WORST IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND IT IS THAT COMBINATION THAT MAKES THIS SO HOORAY THEY'RE FULL OF THE LAW YOU BELIEVE SHOULD BE CHANGED THE AMENDMENT OR YES WE USED TO HAVE A LOT IN THIS COUNTRY IN AMERICA THAT BAND ASSAULT WEAPONS IT WAS CALLED THE BRADY BILL AND IT UNFORTUNATELY EXPIRED
AND WE CAN'T GET IT RENEWED BECAUSE OF THE EXTREMISM OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WHICH THINKS THAT A SMALL CHANGE IN THE LAW ABOUT ASSAULT WEAPONS AUTOMATIC WEAPONS WILL SOMEHOW TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY WHEN NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT JOHN HELP WELL YOU ASKED JIMMY IF HE THOUGHT THAT THE MOMENT SHOULD BE CHANGED I THINK HE REALLY MEANS THAT THE LAW THE LAW SHOULD NOT BE AMENDMENT SO YOU AND I BOTH
BE CLEAR ABOUT YOU BOTH ACCEPT OF THE MEMBER OF ITSELF SHOULD REMAIN THE RIGHT BRANCH YOU'RE NODDING OR BOTH RIGHT SO WHAT DO YOU THINK I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH JAMIE I KNOW YOU KNOW ASSAULT WEAPONS BEING USED IN WARS IT'S ON THEY ARE MILITARY THAT SHOULD HAVE IT FOR THAT KIND OF DEFENCE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY REASON IN SELF PROTECTION BASED ON OUR MEN MEANT THAT A HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND
FIRE AND NOT EVEN HAVE TO RELOAD OR CLICK AGAIN BUT JUST HOLD THE BUTTON DOWN AND KILL PEOPLE
THAT'S REMARKABLE I JUST WISH THERE OUR AGREEMENT AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IN THIS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TRACKERS THEORETICALLY OR AN OPPOSITE SIDE RIGHT I WOULD BUT TRANSLATED INTO A CONGA IN OUR EXECUTIVE PASSING THAT KIND OF IN WOOD I CONTROL WHY DOESN'T IT HAPPEN WELL AS I SAID THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON THEIR LOBBY IN KENT CONTROL LAWS BEING PREVENTED BY ON A DAY LIKE THIS
WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT EVEN THOSE EXTREMISTS AT THE N.R.A. WILL THINK AGAIN AND JOHN HELP HERE'S THE SAME SORT I'M I'M IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT SO THE LAW MUST BE CHANGED
YOU'RE NOT AS JIMMY SAYS THERE WAS A LOT AT ONE TIME I THINK WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT IS THE POWER THAT THE N.R.A. HAS OVER THE REPUBLICANS RIGHT THERE WE MUST END UP THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH THANK YOU THAT'S FROM JOHN MAKE A MORE
B.B.C. NEWS AT NINE O'CLOCK THE F.B.I.
