SARAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE GUARDIAN IS FOCUSING ON THE ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT ARE TAKING PLACE IN LONDON TODAY HAS OPINION OPINION PIECE FROM A DAVID CAMERON SAYING THAT THE LONGER I'VE BEEN IN THERE THIS JOB THE MORE I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE THINGS WE WANT TO SEE COUNTRIES MOVING OUT OF POVERTY PEOPLE BENEFITING FROM THEIR NATION'S NATURAL RESOURCES THE GROWTH OF GENUINE DEMOCRACIES WILL NEVER BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT AN ALL OUT ASSAULT

THE B. B. C. ITSELF IS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF QUITE A FEW PAPERS THAT'S BECAUSE THE WHITE PAPER COMES OUT TODAY WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS B.B.C. STARS KEEP PAY DEAL SECRETS AFTER GOVERNMENT CLIMB DOWN IS HOW THE TIMES REPORTS ON THE OVERNIGHT BRIEFING ABOUT WHAT WILL BE IN THAT WHITE PAPER HE REPORTS ONE HUNDRED B.B.C. STARS WILL KEEP THEIR PAY SECRET AFTER MINISTERS BACK DOWN ON DEMANDS TO DICK'S CLOSED THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO ARE PAID MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND
MAJOR HAVE ALL BEEN TOLD THAT STORES ON BIGGER SALARIES THOSE ARE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WILL BE IN AN OVERHAUL OF THE BROADCASTER THE TELEGRAPH TO TAKE ON THAT IS WATCHDOG TO GET TEETH INTO B. B. C. FINANCES IT POINTS OUT THE BABES WILL BE FORCED TO OPEN ITS BOOKS THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING WATCHDOG ALLOW MINISTERS TO APPOINT NEARLY HALF THE MEMBERS OF ITS NEW BOARD AND HAND OVER REGULATORY POWERS TO OFCOM
THE LEAD STORY FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES IS THAT THE BUSINESS ACTUALLY SUCH A JOB HAD AND HOW TO STEAL EXPECTING TO HAVE A DEADLINE FOR THE SALE OF TATA STEEL'S U.K. BUSINESS BY LATE JUNE OTHERWISE THE BUSINESS WILL CLOSE IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES RUNS THROUGH THE STEPS THAT SUCH A JOB IT IS A PLANNING TO TAKE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BUYERS INCLUDING RING FENCING THE BRITISH STEEL A PENSION FUND AND SHAVING TWO AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS OFF ITS LONG TERM LIABILITIES STRIKING HEADLINE IN THE DAILY MIRROR
FIFTY THOUSAND JUST THINK ABOUT THAT NUMBER FOR A SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND GASTRIC OPS A YEAR TO BE TO BE SETTEE REPORTERS COME OUT SAYING THAT THAT IS HOW MANY OF THOSE GASTRIC BAND OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WAIT LODGE SURGERY ON A SCALE I THINK THAT'S A FEW OF US QUITE REALISED WAS
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX NOW THE PRISONER BRAZIL LOOKS SET TO BE FORCED FROM OFFICE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS THE BRAZILIAN PARLIAMENT IS DEBATING WHETHER TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT WRISTS F. SHE'S ACCUSED OF HIDING THE SIZE OF THE COUNTRY'S BUDGET DEFICIT WILL SPEAK TALK OSBORNE IN JUST A SECOND BUT LET'S DIP NOW ALIVE INTO THAT SENATE DEBATE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PORTUGUESE YOU MAY GET A FLAVOUR OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WHICH IS NICE YOU KNOW
BUT I'VE BEEN A BIT OF A DOUBLE BRUSH I THINK NOW SHE DOES WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE SEE THAT DOWN THERE LIKE HE'S TOLD IT WAS IT BARBER'S DOOR THERE'S A LITTLE BIT BUT JEEPERS UH BUT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO PRESIDENT RESERVE LEAVING OFFICE SHE'S DESCRIBED IT AS A CLUE HER CRITICS SAY NO THEY ARE MERELY PURSUING THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE SHE'S BROKEN BUDGETARY RULES CAMILLA COSTA CAN EXPLAIN MORE SHE'S THE B.B.C.'S BRAZIL CORRESPONDENT IS IMPEACHMENT NOW CERTAIN CAMILLA
IT LOOKS MORE AND MORE UNLIKELY THEIR PRESIDENT IF INDEED THE SIDES TO MOVE FORWARD THEIR PROCEEDINGS WHILE SHE WILL BE SUSPENDED IN IT DOES LOOK LIKELY THAT SHE WILL NOT COME BACK THE PRESIDENT HOWEVER VOWS TO FIGHT UNTIL THE END TO RESIST
AND HER GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN INDICATIONS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO TAKE THE PROCESS TO THE SUPREME COURT TO CHALLENGE THE PROCESS AT THE SUPREME COURT FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN AND THIS IS A LIVELY DEBATE ISN'T IT NOT ONLY INSIDE PARLIAMENT BUT WITH PROTESTERS FOR AND AGAINST HER OUTSIDE PART
EXACTLY TODAY ESPECIALLY THE DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BEEN SMALLER THAN IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE LOWER HOUSE OF CONGRESS VOTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ESPECIALLY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS THERE WAS STILL THE FEELING THAT MAYBE THE VOTE COULD GO ON THE GOVERNMENT'S FAVOUR NOW
THIS FEELING IS NO LONGER THERE IT LOOKS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE SENATOR'S WILL VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCEEDINGS SO THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS BUT SMALLER ONES IN THIS IS A VERY LONG SESSION IT STARTED IN THE MORNING IN BRAZIL IT'S NOW THE EARLY HOURS OF THURSDAY
THERE'S STILL AT LEAST FIFTEEN SENATORS TO SPEAK NOT TO MENTION ACCUSATION DEFENCE SO THEY CAN CAST THEIR VOTES ARE BRAZILIANS WERE WAKE UP THIS MORNING STILL TO SEE THE DEBATE GOING ON IN THE SENATE WILL BRING YOU MORE OF THAT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON WE MAY HAVE THE CONCLUSION BUT WITH FIFTEEN STILL TO SPEAK IT MAY BE THAT THAT DOESN'T COME TILL LATER IN THE MORNING CAN COST A THANK YOU
THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE NUMBER OF ABORTIONS TAKING PLACE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD REMAINED LARGELY UNCHANGED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS RESEARCH JUST PUBLISHED IN THE LANCET MEDICAL JOURNAL ALSO SAYS THE GLOBALLY A QUARTER OF ALL PREGNANCIES ARE TERMINATED OUR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JANE DRAPER IS ON THE LINE IS THIS FIGURE FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD A SURPRISE JANE
IT'S DIFFICULT I DO ASKED THE RESEARCH AS THIS AND CERTAINLY THE FIGURE OF ONE IN FOUR OF ALL PREGNANCIES BEING TERMINATED I THINK JUMPED OUT TO MANY OF US WHO'VE LOOKED AT THIS DATA THEY SAID WHAT REALLY STRUCK THEM WAS THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE ABORTION RATES ARE REMAINING PRETTY MUCH UNCHANGED AND IN THE RICHER WORLD
ABORTION RATES HAVE COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY'RE VERY STRUCK BY THAT DIVERGENCE IT'S QUITE A COMPLICATED PICTURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAY IS THAT IF YOU RESTRICT ABORTION IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE IT LESS FREQUENT THERE ARE HIGH RATES FOR EXAMPLE IN LATIN AMERICA
AS A REGION THEY ALSO SAY THAT MOST OF THESE THESE ABORTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND OFTEN WOMEN SIMPLY AREN'T USING CONTRACEPTION EITHER THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE AT RISK OF GETTING PREGNANT OR THEY DON'T WANT TO USE IT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS THAT SORT OF REASON SO MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS SO THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE BASIC PREMISE THAT CONTRACEPTION IS EITHER NOT AVAILABLE NOT ENCOURAGE DOOR
ILLEGAL THIS THIS CERTAINLY THAT LINK AND ALSO THEY SAY OVERALL ACROSS THE WORLD THERE IS A DEMAND FOR SMALLER FAMILIES AND THEY THINK THAT IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT'S NOT SO MUCH LIKELY TO BE MET IN TERMS OF SERVICES THAT WILL HELP WOMEN ACHIEVE THAT AND WHAT ABOUT THE THE TRENT ARE GOING FOR OUT OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE THEM THE RESEARCHERS THINK THAT THIS SORT OF GLOBAL PICTURE IS GOING TO CHANGE THE NEXT TIME THEY THEY MAKE THIS SORT OF ASSESSMENT
WELL THEY THINK CERTAINLY IN THE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD THE ABORTION RATE IS DECLINING FASTER THAN THE PREGNANCY RATE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING THOSE DECLINE SEE IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT PICTURE TO TO CONJURE UP BECAUSE WOMEN OFTEN UNDER REPORTING SURVEYS ABOUT ABORTIONS AND THESE ARE NEW GLOBAL ESTIMATES WHICH SHOW HIGHER LEVELS OF ABORTION ROOM THEY PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THIS
OVERALL THEY DO THINK THAT ACCESS TO SERVICES IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEY ARE ALSO WORKING ON FIGURES FOR UNSAFE ABORTIONS BECAUSE CLIMBED A STEIN ABORTIONS OR A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF DEATHS AMONG WOMEN AND MANY MILLIONS BETWEEN SIX TO NINE MILLION WOMEN ARE TREATED FOR COMPLICATIONS FROM UNSAFE ABORTION EVERY YEAR
DRAPER THANK YOU IT'S A QUARTER PAST SIX THE BANK OF ENGLAND PRESENTERS INFLATION REPORT LATER TODAY A GLOOMY ECONOMIC PICTURE IS EXPECTED LUCY BURTON CAN TELL US MORE MORNINGS THANKS NICK OH YES THERE'S A CHANCE TO CHECK THE TEMPERATURE OF THE U.K.'S ECONOMY AND THIS INFLATION REPORT COMES IN THE WAKE OF SOME PRETTY WOEFUL ECONOMIC DATA
WE'VE GOT MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION DOWN AND FACT YESTERDAY WE FOUND INDUSTRIES FALLEN BACK INTO RECESSION BUT TODAY'S REPORT WERE MOST LIKELY FOCUS ON ONE THING IT WON'T BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY TO FINANCIAL STABILITY IF BRITAIN EXITS THE E.U.
AND I'M JOINED FROM BRISTOL BY LATE COLLAPSED SENIOR ANALYST HARGREAVES LANDS DONE GOOD MORNING HOW DO YOU THINK THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO REACT TO CARNEY'S FORECAST OF UNCERTAINTY OVER BRACKS THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO REACT TO WHAT CARNEY SAYS IN TERMS OF BRECHT'S IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE REFERENDUM IS COMING IT'S OUT THERE AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO STILL HAVE SOME PERSISTED
I HOPE THE BANK OF ENGLAND FORECASTS ON THE ECONOMY WILL PROVE CORRECT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE ANY SORT OF PREDICTION POWER WHEN IT COMES THE OUTCOME OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM VOTE SO IT'S A A SORT OF KNOWN
THAT THE BRACKS IT IS OUT THERE I THINK HE'S ACTUALLY GOT A REALLY DIFFICULT JOB BECAUSE HE'S TREADING A FINE LINE OF COURSE HE HAS TO ADDRESS THAT BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS THE BRECK SAID WHICH IS A BIG COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY BUT I SUSPECT THAT HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE PILLORIED FOR BECOMING TOO POLITICAL IF HE DOES MAKE ANY COMMENTS WHICH COULD BE INTERPRETED AS SUGGESTING PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE ONE WAY RATHER THAN THE OTHER
OF COURSE I DO HE SAYS SOMEONE'S NOT GOING TO BE PLEASED I WANT TO BRING IN ERIC NORLAND VERY QUICKLY SENIOR ECONOMIST OF CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE ASKED THIS QUESTION BECAUSE THOSE SOME SUGGESTION THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS POISED IN SHE'S NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND RATES AS WE KNOW HAVE ALREADY GONE BELOW ZERO ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD JUST GOING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM NORMAL MONETARY POLICY AREN'T WE YES WE ARE IN FACT I THINK
THE MAIN BANKS THAT ARE REALLY PUSHING NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES OR THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IN THE BANK OF JAPAN WHICH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND AS A TREMENDOUS LUXURY BECAUSE THEY CAN SIT BACK AND WATCH HOW THIS EXPERIMENT PLAYS OUT ELSEWHERE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO ATTEMPT AT THEMSELVES I THINK FOR ME THE UNITED KINGDOM NO EVEN IN SPITE OF SOME OF THE RATHER SAFT ECONOMIC FIGURES YOU MENTIONED IN GENERAL HAS A FAIRLY HEALTHY ECONOMY ONLY FIVE PER CENT OR A SO UNEMPLOYMENT ONE AND A HALF PER CENT QUARANTE
I DON'T THINK THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT'S EMINENTLY ERIC WILL BE CHATTING MORE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE LATER EXECUTIVE PAY BACK ON THE AGENDA AGAIN TODAY AND ONCE MORE SHAREHOLDERS BEING ADVISED TO VOTE DOWN EXCESSIVE REMUNERATION PACKAGES IN THE FIRING LINE TODAY ANTONIA HOTTER OR SARA FOR ALLOYS AND ADAM CROZIER OF I.T.V. HERE'S TEN BUSH HEAD OF GOVERNMENTS THE SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP PYRRHIC HE'S EXPLAINING WHY HE THINKS THEIR PAY IS NOT APPROPRIATE
ON LLOYDS THE RECOMMENDATION ON REMUNERATION IS IN A POSE IT'S THE SAME OLD PROBLEM OF DEFECTIVE PAY SCHEMES THEY'RE NOT LONG TERMINUS CIRCUMVENTING ALSO IN THIS COMPANY BONUS CAPS WITH FIX ALLOWANCES I.E. THEY'RE PUSHING SALARIES UP SO THAT THE BONUS COULD BE A HIGHER AMOUNT WE ARE RECOMMENDING ABSTAIN ON THE PAY OF I.T.V. THEY ALMOST GOT HER SUPPORT BASICALLY THERE'S TWO HIGHER BONUS ELEMENT BUT THE OVERALL PACKAGE IS PRETTY WELL ALIGNED WITH SHAREHOLDER EXPERIENCE OF PERFORMANCE IN THIS COMPANY
WE'LL ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS LATER TODAY AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE PRETTY ROBUST SO WHILST QUIZZES FOUR MILLION PAYBACK IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT TO US ESPECIALLY TO US MORTALS HEE HOUSE WITH FILTERS REMIT HASN'T HE YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THIS RAISES AN INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE BOTH OF THE COMPANIES IN QUESTION TODAY ARE ON THE FACE OF A PERFORMING QUITE WELL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVES HAVE DONE GOOD JOBS OF COURSE THE NUMBERS INVOLVED
A PRETTY EYE WATERING BUT I THINK YOU KNOW ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON THE NUMBERS IS IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IT HAS TO COME BACK TO THE ACTUAL PROCESS FOR DECIDING REMUNERATION AND IF YOU CAN GET THAT RIGHT THEN ALL THEY'LL SHOULD FOLLOW FROM THAT IF YOU LOOK AT I.T.V. THE PACKAGE THAT WAS THAT THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING
PATER EXEC HE WAS ACTUALLY AGREED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR THREE YEARS AND AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT BOTH OF THESE COMPANIES TODAY THE EXECUTIVES THIS YEAR ACTUALLY GETTING PAID LESS THAN LAST YEAR SO THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING NOW THAT'S PROBABLY COME DOWN TO TWO FACTORS I THINK ONE IS THAT
MARKETS HAVE TAKEN A TUMBLE SO SHAREHOLDERS PROBABLY AREN'T QUITE AS HAPPY AS THEY WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR WHEN THE FOOTSIE WAS ABOVE SEVEN THOUSAND BUT ALSO I THINK THE SHAREHOLDER GROUPS HAVE GOT THE BIT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AND I THINK THERE IS A RISING LEVEL OF RECOGNITION THAT THE FUND MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY HAS TO TAKE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
ARGUMENTS OVER FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM HAD BEEN AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN POLITICS AND POLICY MAKING SINCE THE FORMATION OF THE REPUBLIC THE EXPERIENCE OF BRITISH BLOCKADES DURING THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE CONVINCE THE COUNTRY'S FOUNDING FATHERS THE PROTECTING LOCAL MANUFACTURING WAS A NECESSITY ARGUMENTS OVER THE TWO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT OR CONTINUE DURING THE CIVIL WAR THE GREAT DEPRESSION THEY REAR THEIR HEAD AGAIN DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A GOVERNMENT FOUGHT TO SAVE THE MOTOR INDUSTRY
AND THE DEBATE IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE NOW AS CONTENDERS BATTLE IT OUT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THEY TRUMP AND SANDRA'S SAY THEY'LL PROTECT MANUFACTURING JOBS EVEN HILLARY CLINTON HAS DIPPED HER TOE INTO THE DEBATE BUT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE EXTREME TERRACE TRUMP SAYS HE'LL INFLICT FORTY FIVE PER CENT ON CHINESE GOODS THIRTY FIVE PER CENT ON FORD CARS FROM MEXICO COULD SPELL DISASTER FOR THE U.S. AND THE WORLD ECONOMY AND I'M JOINED AGAIN BY ERIC NO ONE IN THE SENIOR ECONOMIST AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SEA ANY GROUP
ERIC IS THIS THE END OF GLOBALISATION IS FREE TRADE PARFAIT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S THE END OF GLOBALISATION BECAUSE GLOBALISATION REALLY HAS TWO THINGS THAT DRIVES AT FIRST OF ALL THERE'S THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS OF ADDITIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY GOING TO BE SLOWING DOWN BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THE RHETORIC IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AS OFFICE WOULD HAVE WANING SUPPORT
IN CONGRESS TO PASS THEM BUT WE ALSO SEE THE SAME THING IN OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD BUT THE OTHER MAJOR DRIVER OF GLOBALISATION AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN COMMUNICATIONS AND TRADING SERVICES ACROSS THE GLOBE INN AT SOMETHING GOVERNMENTS HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME REGULATING
OF COURSE WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO FEEL ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THE THOUGHT OF PROTECTIONISM IS SO ENTICING CAN'T YOU WELL YEAH I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WITH FREE TRAIN THE DOWNSIDES OF FREE TRADE ARE OFTEN VERY VISIBLE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A FACTORY WORKER
AND YOUR PLAIT SHUTS DOWN AND YOU'RE ASKED TO TRAIN EMPLOYEES AND A NEW PLANT IN MEXICO OR IN CHINA AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE HER JOB IT'S A VERY VISIBLE DOWNSIDE AND THE OTHER HAND ALL OF US HAVE THESE TREMENDOUS ARRAY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US MUCH LESS EXPENSE AND THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE AS A RESULT OF FREE TRADE WITH THAT PART WE JUST TAKE FOR GRANTED IT'S NOT AS VISIBLE AND HOW DAMAGING WOULD SLAPPING EXTREME HIGH TARIFFS THE AS A MODEL FOR THE U.S. AND OF COURSE THE WORLD ECONOMY
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF DANGERS ONLY THINK IN GENERAL PROTECTIONISM OBVIOUSLY BENEFITS THE PROTECTED INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING CONSUMERS BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF REPRISALS FROM THE OTHER COUNTRIES SO THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRADE WAR AND ONE THING I THINK IS SLOWING THE GROWTH OF THE WORLD ECONOMY AT THE MOMENT IT'S A TREAT ALREADY ISN'T GROWING VERY QUICKLY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS SO THERE IS A DANGER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL FINALLY THE FUTURE OF THE B.B.C. IS BEING OUTLINED IN WHITE PAPER BY THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN WETTING DAYLE LATER TODAY ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY OVER IMPOSITION OF TOP SLICING THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION LICENCE FEE REVENUE TO RIVAL BROADCASTERS AND INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION COMPANIES TO MAKE SHOWS SO WHO STANDS TO GAIN FROM THE PROPOSALS THAT WAITING GIRLS MADE AND HOW BIG A LOSS WOULD IT BE FOR THE B.B.C.
WITH ME NOW IN THE STUDIO IS ALEX DE GROOT MEDIA ANALYST AT HE'LL HUNT GOOD MORNING ALEX TELL ME FIRST HOW BIG IS THE B.B.C.'S VIEWERSHIP SHARE COMPARE TO OTHER BROADCASTERS SO AT THE MOMENT THE B.B.C. WOULD HAVE BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF SHARE A VIEWING AND THAT WOULD PLAY ACROSS THE FAMILY OF CHANNELS THAT IT THAT IT OFFERS
I T. V. BY COMPARISON WOULD BE IN THE LOW TWENTIES SO THE B. B. C. IS THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN FRONT OF SHARE A VIEWING IN THE U.K. SO HOW WOULD THIS ALL CHANGE IF FOR EXAMPLE A TOP I THING WAS INTRODUCED OR INDEED A SCHEDULING WAS IMPOSED SCHEDULING RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED AND TOP SLICING PER SE WOULD PROBABLY BE TARGETED AT CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING WHICH ISN'T A BIG DRIVER OVERALL OF SHARE VIEWING SO THAT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A CONCERN
IN THAT IN THAT FRAMEWORK BUT IN TERMS OF
SHODDY FLOOR SHOWS WERE SCHEDULING OR WHAT DRIVES THE BIG PEAK TIME AUDIENCES THAT AND THEY LIKE STRICTLY COME DANCING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUITE STRICTLY COME DANCING WOULD BE A GREAT EXAMPLE IF THAT WAS RESCHEDULED OR CHANGED IN TERMS OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCHEDULE THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON PEAK TIME SCHEDULES AND THAT WOULD BE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR AND TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE B.B.C. IN TERMS OF SHARED VIEWING
OF COURSE THE BIG ARGUMENT AGAINST B. B. C. IS THAT IT DISTORTS THE MARKET DO YOU THINK THAT'S A FAIR ACCUSATION I THINK HISTORICALLY IT PROBABLY DID POSSIBLY IN RADIO FUNNILY ENOUGH RATHER THAN TELEVISION I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY THE CASE THESE DAYS AND I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ROLE OF THE POLICY MAKING HIS IS PERHAPS APPROPRIATE TO A BYGONE AGE AND WE'RE LIVING IN AN INTERNET AGE NOW WHERE PEOPLE INCREASINGLY CONSUME ALL MEDIA THROUGH STREAMING DEVICES LEGALLY OR OTHERWISE
AND OF COURSE I.T.V. IS THE BIGGEST RIVAL DO YOU THINK THEY'RE POSSIBLY TRYING TO HAVE THEIR CAKE AND EAT IT WHEN THEY GRAB THE AUDIENCES AND GET THE PRODUCTION COMMISSIONS THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE SHARE OF VIEWING COS THAT WOULD HELP DRIVE COMMERCIAL IMPACTS WHICH WOULD DRIVE ADVERTISING AND AS A PRODUCER I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE
REVENUE POTENTIAL FROM FROM ATTACKING WHAT HITHERTO HAS BEEN INTERNALLY COMMISSION PROGRAMMING AT THE B.B.C. SO I THINK YES FRANKLY THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR CAKE AND EAT IT AND JUST EARLIER WE SPOKE TO LATE ABOUT EXECUTIVE PAY I.T.V. SO I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING YOU AS WELL DO YOU THINK ADAM CRAZES PAY IS UNWARRANTED OR IS IT FAIR
HE'S TAKEN THAT COMPANY FROM TWENTY FIVE P. TO TWO POUNDS TWENTY FIVE SO PURELY IN TERMS THE SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE WINNER AND I THINK SHAREHOLDERS WOULD NOT PREPARED BECAUSE FROM THAT IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE OF COURSE WE DON'T GET INTO THE BASE OVER CORN SUMS BUT IN TERMS OF HAS I.T.V. PERFORMED THE ANSWER IS UNEQUIVOCALLY YES AND IF WE TALK FINALLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CHANNEL FOUR THERE'S ALSO TALK OF PRIVATISATION THERE WHAT DOES THE FUTURE FOR THEM DO YOU THINK IT'S UP FOR GRABS IS EBB AND FLOW IN THE DEBATE HERE
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING'S BEEN DECIDED FINALLY A LOT OF IT WILL BE TIED UP WITH A B. B. C. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN OPTION WHICH IS ON THE TABLE AND OPEN TO THE GOVERNMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED ALEX DE GROOT MEDIA ANALYST PILL HAD I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR OR SO WITH THE ALICE HARDING THE C.E.O. OF TALKTALK THEY'VE GOT THEREFORE WE ARE RESULTS OUT LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LUCY IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES AFTER SIX ELSA MITCHELL'S HERE NOW WITH THE SPORTS NEWS MUM

WHERE WE LAY AND OF COURSE WE WE'VE GOT RID OF A FEW PLAYERS BUT A FEW NEW PLAYERS IN AS THE THE ONLY WAY FORWARD FOR ME TO TURN ROUND WHAT WAS LOOKING PRETTY DISMAL AND PRETTY GRIM OVER OVER THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD CONTRASTING EMOTIONS THEN FOR THE NORWICH MANAGER ALEX NEIL WHO'S DIRECTED SOME OF THE BLAME FOR ALLEGATION AT HIMSELF
CRUCIAL ERRORS ARE CRUCIAL TIMES IN GAMES A SEASON I THINK WE MUST GOOD OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TENSION GAMES DECISION MAKING FROM ME ON OCCASIONS COULD BE BETTER YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S MY BIN HANG SAILOR CAN ITSELF THINGS I COULD HAVE DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND I THINK WITH THEM STRENGTHEN THE SQUAD ON THE SOMME WAS AS MUCH AS I THINK IT NEEDED TO BE STRENGTHENED TO GIVES THE BEST CHANCE AND I THINK WHEN YOU COMBINE ALL THOSE THREE THINGS IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE REALLY TOUGH TO SURVIVE

INTEREST RATES FOR SAVERS HAVE FALLEN TO RECORD LOWER HERSELF TO FURTHER CUTS FROM BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES IN RECENT MONTHS NEW ANALYSIS AT THE SAVINGS MARKET THE B.B.C. NEWS INDICATES THAT THE AVERAGE RETURN FROM THE FIVE BEST EASY ACCESS ACCOUNTS HAS DROPPED FROM OVER THREE PERCENT IN TWENTY TWELVE TO UNDER ONE POINT THREE PER CENT
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO SEVEN WILL THE B.B.C. LARGELY GET WHAT IT WANTS OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WHITE PAPER ON ITS FUTURE PUBLISHED TODAY THERE'S A LOT OF HEATED DEBATE AHEAD OF ITS RELEASE AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY OUR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT DAVID SILLITOE ARE GIVEN THE LEVEL IN THE TONE OF THAT DEBATE IT DAVID HOW DOES WHAT WE KNOW NOW APPEAR FOR THE B.B.C. HOW DOES IT LOOK LET'S RUN THROUGH IT VERY QUICKLY
BASIC STUFF ELEVEN YOU'RE A CHARTER FOR THE B. B. C. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TEN YOU CHARTER BECAUSE IT HAD STARTED TO COINCIDE WITH ELECTIONS AND NOT ONLY WHETHER B.B.C. REPORTING ELECTIONS THEY WERE BECOMING PART OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN THEMSELVES SO THE LICENCE FEE WILL ALSO LAST FOR THE NEXT ELEVEN YEARS WILL RISE WITH INFLATION A DEAL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN ANNOUNCED BUT
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT'LL BE CONFIRMED FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TRUST WILL BE ABOLISHED THAT'S THE BODY THAT OVERSEES THE B. B. C. SO THE FINAL REFEREE ON IMPARTIALITY AND ACCURACY AND FUTURE WILL BE THE GOVERNMENT'S INDEPENDENT REGULATOR OFCOM THERE'LL BE A NEW BOARD TO RUN THE B.B.C. QUESTION THERE IS HOW MANY OF THE DIRECTORS ON THAT BOARD WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD
THAT AT LEAST HALF WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE B.B.C. SO THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOME MOVEMENT THERE STAR PAY THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT ANYONE WHO EARNS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE FULL DETAILS OF THEIR PAY WAS GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC NOW AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND IT ANYONE WHO EARNS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THEIR NAMES WILL BE REVEALED BUT NO MORE THAN THAT AND DIVERSITY WRITTEN INTO THE CHARTER BUT WHAT'S PERHAPS
REALLY INTERESTING ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T APPEARED SO NO MAJOR TOP SLICING HANDING THE LICENCE FEE TO OTHER BROADCASTERS NO MEDDLING IN THE SCHEDULES TELLING THE B. B. C. WHEN AND WHEN IT CAN'T SAY PUT OUT STRICTLY COME DANCING SO THERE HAS THERE BEEN A GOVERNMENT CLIMB DOWN OR WAS OR WAS SOME OF THE RHETORIC ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT DO TO THE B. B. C. ALARMIST
THE GREEN PAPER WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY JOHN WAITING DALE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE B.B.C. SENT A CHILL THROUGH THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT ESSENTIALLY THE DEAL HAD BEEN DONE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD YES YOU CAN HAVE THE LICENCE FEE AND IT'S GOING TO RISE WITH INFLATION FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THEY THOUGHT ESSENTIALLY
MAJOR STORIES HAVE BEEN DONE IT'S ALL THE FINE DETAIL SO THERE IS CERTAINLY BEEN A ROOT AND BRANCH EXAMINATION OF THE PURPOSE OF THE B.B.C. BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IS WHO HAS BEEN ON THE COMMONS MEDIA SELECT COMMITTEE FOR A LONG TIME AND HAS HAD MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A GREAT BRITISH INSTITUTION
AS HE SOMETIMES DESCRIBED THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION POUND MARKET INTERVENTION BRIEFLY THEN IF THE BIG CHANGE THIS WOULD BRING IN WHICH IS A CHANGE IN THE GOVERNANCE HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF THE B.B.C. NOT A GREAT DEAL BUT IT DOES KIND OF CHANGE FOR INSTANCE
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE B.B.C. RATHER THAN SITTING UP THE ROAD FROM THOSE HERE IN GREAT PORTLAND STREET WILL BE SITTING IN THE SAME BUILDING WITH EVERYBODY ELSE SO BE A DEGREE OF DAY TO DAY DECISION MAKING
PROBABLY SLIGHTLY MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN IT'S BEEN AT THE MOMENT TO HAVE BEEN A SENSE OF ESSENTIALLY TWO BODIES HOWEVER TO LOSE THEIR TRUST AND FOR IT TO BE A GOVERNMENT INDEPENDENT REGULATOR OFCOM
IS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME THE SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE FINAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT
IS BROADCAST IS IT IMPARTIAL IS IT FAIR IS NO LONGER ENTIRELY WITHIN THE B.B.C. DAVID SAID IT OH THANK YOU
IT IS NOW TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO SEVEN WILL VOTERS EVER GET TO SEE A TELEVISION DEBATE BETWEEN THE LEADERS OF THE TWO SIDES IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE PRIME MINISTER AGAINST SAY BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO THAT LOOKS INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY
WHICH IS LEATHER VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TO ACCUSE DOWNING STREET ARE TRYING TO FIX THE RULES AND EXTRAORDINARILY I.T.V. OF JOINING THE IN CAMPAIGN OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH CAN TELL US MORE THERE IS A LOT OF FURY BEHIND THE SCENES ABOUT THIS NORMAN THERE'S AN EXPLOSIVE ROW
ERUPTING BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL LEAVE SIDE AND I. T. V. AFTER I.T.V. ANNOUNCED ITS FORMAT FOR THE E.U. U. T. V. DEBATES AND ITS MAIN PROGRAMME WILL FEATURE THE PRIME MINISTER AND NIGEL FARRAJ NOT APPEARING ON THE SAME AT THE SAME TIME BUT IN THE SAME PROGRAMME AND THAT IS IGNITED ABSOLUTE FURY FROM THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T INCLUDE THEIR FRONT PEOPLE BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO AND THIS MORNING THEY ARE ACCUSING
I.T.V. OF BEING PART OF THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN OF CAVING IN TO PRESSURE FROM NUMBER TEN THEY'RE MAKING AMBIGUOUS THREATS TO I.T.V. AND I JUST WANT TO READ YOU NICK VERY BRIEFLY THE THE EMAIL I WAS SENT BY A SENIOR VOTE LEAVE SAUCE WHICH GIVES YOU A FLAVOUR OF THE INCENDIARY RESPONSE SO THIS PERSON SAYS
THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS TRIED EVERYTHING THEY OUTSIDE TO BE AN HOUR FIXING THE DEBATES TO SHUT OUT THE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN I.T.V. AS LED BY PEOPLE LIKE ROBERT PESTON WHO CAMPAIGNED FOR BRITAIN TO JOIN THE EURO I.T.V. AS LIE TO US AND PRIVATE WHILE SECRETLY STITCHING UP A DEAL WITH CAMERON TO STOP BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO DEBATING THE ISSUES PROPERLY I.T.V. HAS EFFECTIVELY JOINED THE OFFICIAL IN CAMPAIGN AND THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS FUTURE THE PEOPLE IN NUMBER TEN WON'T BE THERE FOR LONG THIS MORNING
THEY ARE STANDING BY THAT COMMENT AND I REALLY TELL YOU DESPITE THE FACT WE OUGHT TO POINT OUT THAT ROBERT PESTON HIMSELF DENIED EVER CAMPAIGNING FOR THE EURO AND I.T.V. HAVE INSISTED THAT THEY ARE IMPARTIAL I MEAN IT'S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY TO LAUNCH THAT SORT OF ATTACK FRANKIE EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S TRUE IT'S HARDLY THE WAY TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE WELL I MEAN I THINK IT TELLS US TWO THINGS ONE IS THE SHEER HORROR
AT THE THOUGHT OF NIGEL FARRAJ BEING ABLE TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY VIEW HIM AS POLITICALLY TOXIC IN THERE TRY TO KEEP HIM AS FAR AWAY AS IS HUMANLY AS IT'S HUMANLY POSSIBLE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THE DANGER OF THEIR RESPONSES IT RISKS COMPOUNDING THE FARRAJ FACTOR WHICH THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID IN OTHER WORDS IT SOUNDS A BIT WILD EIDER AND EXTREME WILL PLAY TO THE NARRATIVE WHICH THE REMAIN SIDE WANT TO MAKE WHICH IS THERE BASICALLY
THEY ARE PEOPLE FROM SORT OF THE FAR RIGHT AND NOT THE MAINSTREAM MIDDLE GROUND QUICK ONE NORMAN I TAKE YOU INTO TERRITORIES A LITTLE DIFFICULT YOU'VE HAD AN EMAIL LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE YOU DON'T REVEAL YOUR SOURCES BUT A MAN AT THE TOP OF THAT LEAVE CAMPAIGN DOMINIC CUMMINGS USED TO WORK FOR MICHAEL GO HE'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY CRITICAL OF NIGEL FARRAJ AND NOT WANTING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CAMPAIGN SHOULD ONE
DETECT HAND OF CUMMINGS I MEAN IT'S NO SECRET THAT THEY VIEW NIGEL FARRAJ AS THE KISS OF DEATH TO THEIR CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO APPEAL TO THE MIDDLE GROUND JUST ONE OTHER THING NICK YOU MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING WILL WE SEE THE P.M. APPEARING WITH BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO BY I CAN TELL YOU THE ANSWER IS NO
NUMBER TEN ARE SAYING THEY WILL WHO WILL PROMISE WILL NOT APPEAR IN ANY OTHER DEBATE WITH ANY OTHER CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANTED TO BE A BLUE ON BLUE FIGHT THEY DON'T WANT THIS REFERENDA TO BE SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SO THAT WON'T HAPPEN FORGIVE ME WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT THERE THE BEEBS YOU PUBLISH THE DETAILS OF ITS DEBATES A LITTLE WHILE LATER
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN PARTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL TODAY TRY TO MEND FENCES WITH DONALD TRUMP THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE PAUL RYAN SAYS HE'S NOT YET READY TO OFFER HIM SUPPORT BUT THERE WILL BE A MEETING AIMED AT TRYING TO UNIFY THE PARTY I ASKED ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL HOW MUCH WORK THERE WAS TO DO ON THAT FRONT
HUGE AMOUNT I THINK THEY'RE A VERY VERY BIG DIFFERENCES ON POLICY AND STYLE BUT MAKE A RECONCILIATION KIND OF SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE I MEAN ON TERMS OF HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY IN TERMS OF HIS TRADE POLICY THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SAID CERTAIN THINGS I THINK HAS OFFENDED AND UPSET AN AWFUL LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN THE LEADERSHIP AND SO TRUMP FINDS HIMSELF IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY POSITION BRITISH POLITICS IS NOT AN EXACT COMPARISON WITH U.S. POLITICS
BUT IT IS LIKE A CONSERVATIVE LEADER GOING TO WANT TO BE PRIME MINISTER WITHOUT THE TWO PREVIOUS LIVING PRIME MINISTER SUPPORTED HIM THE TWO PREVIOUS CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER SUPPORTING HIM AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHAIRMAN NOT SUPPORTING HIM IN REAL TERMS THAT IS EXACTLY THE POSITION THAT DONALD TRUMP FINDS HIMSELF IN WHEN HE GOES INTO THIS MEETING BUT SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE POLICY AND STYLE BECOMING LESS PRONOUNCED AND THEREFORE THAT THESE TWO SIDES MIGHT BE MOVING CLOSER TOGETHER
WELL OF COURSE THE RISK FOR DONALD TRUMP IS THAT IF HE MOVES TOO FAR TOWARDS ACCOMMODATING THE POSITIONS OF THE LEADERSHIP HE KIND OF ALIENATES THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM IN THIS POSITION THAT HE IS THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE NOWT THERE WERE WORDS THAT HE MADE IT LAST NIGHT WHICH SOUND ON THE FACE A BIT LIKE A SOFTENING ON HIS POSITION ON IMMIGRATION IN PARTICULAR HIS BAND ON
ANY MUSLIMS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AND HE HAS SAID IT'S A TEMPORARY BAN AND WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT'S JUST A SUGGESTION UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON NOW VERBAL EXACTITUDE IS NOT GREAT WITH DONALD TRUMP SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A SOFTENING OF THE POSITION TO TRY TO REACH OUT TO THE LEADERSHIP
OR WHETHER HE HAS JUST PHRASE THINGS VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT IT'S ALL AS A RESPONSE TO SAID HE CAN'T BECOMING THE MAYOR OF LONDON AND SIDDIQUE KHAN CALLING HIS VIEWS IGNORANT DONALD TRUMP HAS NOW COME ON AND SAID LOOK YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST A SUGGESTION AT THIS TIME UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
THAT SAID HE ALSO ACCUSES CITY CALM OF ALMOST BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND EGG STILL SAYING THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND THAT IT HAS TO BE TACKLED JOHN SO PAUL THANK YOU
NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS TODAY'S ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IS THE MAIN STORY FOR THE TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN THE TIMES HAILED THE PROSPECT OF A NEW CRIMINAL OFFENCES FOR BUSINESSES THAT FAILED TO STOP START OFF ENGAGING IN FRAUD HAS A RADICAL REFORM OF CORPORATE LIABILITY LAWS HE RUNS A COMMENT PIECE BY THE AFGHAN PRESIDENT ASHRAF GARNIE WILL BE HEARING FROM HIM LATER IN THE PROGRAMME HE INSISTS HIS COUNTRY IS CHANGING AND REMOVING THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING CALLED
FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT THE PHRASE USED OF COURSE BY MISTER CAMERON THIS WEEK WRITING IN THE GUARDIAN THE PRIME MINISTER EXPRESSES HIS DETERMINATION TO CLEAN UP BRITAIN'S PROPERTY MARKET BY REQUIRING ALL FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT OWN PROPERTIES HERE TO DISCLOSE THEIR TRUE OWNERS THE FINANCIAL TIMES OF THE PROPOSAL IS A SURPRISE AIMED AT ENERGISING THE SUMMIT ACCORDING TO THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAS TO CAMERON'S REFUSING TO TAKE PART IN HEAD TO HEAD TELEVISION DEBATES ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION
REFERENDUM THE PRIME MINISTER IT SAYS HAS RULED OUT A CONFRONT ATION WITH HER LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS SUCH AS BORIS JOHNSON BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT THE FOCUS TO BE ON THE ISSUE OF CONFLICT IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE TELEGRAPH SAYS MISTER CAMERON WILL BE QUESTIONED SEPARATELY WHEN HE APPEARS IN AN I.T.V. PROGRAMME NEXT MONTH WITH THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARAGE THE METRO HIGHLIGHTS COMMENTS BY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE BORIS JOHNSON DISMISSING MISTER CAMERON'S WARNINGS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A BRITISH EXIT
TOTALLY DEMENTED THE DAILY EXPRESS ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO BAN ALL KETTLES AFTER THE REFERENDUM AND REPLACE THEM WITH LOW ENERGY VERSIONS EXPRESS ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSAL WILL BE PORTRAYED AS AN ATTEMPT TO GET HER MISSIONS UNDER CONTROL BUT HE'S ACTUALLY DRIVEN IT SAYS BY A CEASELESS QUEST TO BUILD A EUROPEAN SUPERSTATE THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS THAT A TERRORIST SUSPECT HE WAS ARRESTED IN ITALY THIS WEEK HAS HAD POSED AS AN AFGHAN REFUGEE TO VISIT POTENTIAL TARGETS IN BRITAIN
HOW KEEN ARE SERIOUS ACCUSED OF BEING A MEMBER OF A FIVE STRONG ISLAMIC STATE TO SELL AN IMAGE FOUND ON HIS PHONE IS THOUGHT TO SHOW HIM HOLDING AN ASSAULT RIFLE IN THE STOREROOM AT A BRITISH SUPERMARKET THE SUN CHARACTERISES THE PROPOSED NEW CHART OF THE B. B. C. AS A HUMILIATING CLIMB DOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT IT'S DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CORPORATION WON'T NOW BE FORCED TO GIVE DETAILS OF EVERY STAR NAME EARNING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AS ORIGINALLY BRIEFED BOOZY GLEE IS THAT LINED THE GUARDIAN REPORTS OF THE PRIME MINISTER INTERVENED PERSONALLY
TO SET THE LEVEL FOR DISCLOSURE AT A HIGHER LEVEL FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE EYE PAPER IS EXCITED BY THE PROSPECT OF MEGA PAY DEALS AT THE B. B. C. BEEN REVEALED IN WHAT IT CALLS A RADICAL OVERHAUL OF THE CHARTER
AND FINALLY THE NAME OF JEREMY CLARKSON'S NEW MOTORING CHAUFFEUR AMAS AND THE GRAND TOUR HAS LEFT FANS UNDERWHELMED ACCORDING TO THE DAILY STAR THE TELEGRAPH THOUGH HAS A THEORY THAT IT MAY CONTAIN A HIDDEN TRIBE AT THE B. B. C. WHICH STILL OWNS THE RIGHTS TO THE TOP GEAR NAME IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THE NEW SHOWS ACRONYM T. G. T. COULD BE READ AS TOP GEAR TO THE TELEGRAPH WONDERS IF THIS IS PERHAPS THE EQUIVALENT OF A SPORTS CAR DRIVER ROARING PAST THE CARAVAN BLOCKING HIS PROGRESS ON A COUNTRY ROAD AND PARTING
WITH A CHEEKY GESTURE I DON'T SUSPECT I KNOW WHAT THAT YOU JESTER IS BUT MAKE WEREN'T DISCUSSED THIS TIME THE MONEY IT IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THE GOVERNMENT IS PUBLISHING PROPOSALS TO OVERHAUL HOW THE B.B.C. IS GOVERNED THE MINISTER'S APPEAR TO HAVE SHELVES SOME OF THE MORE RADICAL IDEAS TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE CORPORATION
DAVID CAMERON HAS FACED AS LAST PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY YEAR THE CURRENT SESSION COMES TO AN END LATER TODAY HE TRIED TO MEND DIPLOMATIC BRIDGES AFTER HE WAS OVERHEARD TALKING ABOUT NIGERIA AND AFGHANISTAN BEING FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT OUR PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HUMOUR REPORTS
DESPITE HER CAREER IS P. ARCHIE FOR A T. V. COMPANY FOLLOWED BY FIFTEEN YEARS AND FRONTLINE POLITICS DAVID CAMERON WAS CAUGHT OUT THIS WEEK MAKING UNDIPLOMATIC REMARKS IN THE VICINITY OF A CAMERA WITH A MICROFILM BUT HE WON'T BE FALLING FOR THAT AGAIN NO FIRST OF ALL CHECK THE MICROPHONES ON BEFORE SPEAKING IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS FILM TELLING THE QUEEN THAT'S A RECEPTION THAT DELEGATES FROM FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT COUNTRIES SUCH AS NIGERIA AND AFGHANISTAN WERE COMING TO HIS ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMAT'S LATER TODAY BUS CASTING A BIT OF A DIPLOMATIC PAUL OVER THE EVENT
BACK IN THE COMMONS THE S.N.P. WESTMINSTER LEADER ANGUS ROBERTSON WONDERED WHETHER THE U.K. WAS IN MUCH OF A POSITION TO PREACH TO OTHERS THEN AWAY HOW'S THE PRIME MINISTER READ THE APPEALS FROM NIGERIAN CAMPAIGNERS WHO SAY
OUR EFFORTS ARE SADLY UNDERMINED IF COUNTRIES SUCH AS YOUR OWN ARE WELCOMING OUR CAREER
TO HIDE THEIR ILL GOTTEN GAINS AND EURGH LUXURY HORNE'S DEPARTMENT STORE
DEALERSHIPS PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WILL ACCEPT THEIR CASH WITH NO QUESTIONS
DAVID CAMERON READILY ADMITTED THE TRUTH OF IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE WHOLE POINT YOU'RE HOLDING A SUMMIT IN LONDON IS TO SAY THE ACTION IS NECESSARY BY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS WELL AS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND ONE OF THE STEPS WERE TAKING TO MAKE SURE
THAT FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT OWN U.K. PROPERTY HAVE TO DECLARE WHO THE BENEFICIAL OWNER IS WILL BE ONE OF THE WAYS WE MAKE SURE THAT PLUNDERED MONEY FROM AFRICAN COUNTRIES CAN'T BE HIDDEN IN LONDON
NOW THE CONSERVATIVE PHILIP DAVIES IS OFTEN QUITE COST STICK WITH HIS PARTY LEADER BUT ON THIS OCCASION BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS COMMENTS ABOUT NIGERIA AN AFGHANI
YOU WILL STOP WHORE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY INTO THOSE AND OF A CORRUPT COUNTRIES UNTIL THEY'VE CLEANED UP
DAVID CAMERON THANKS UM FOR THAT UNEXPECTED SUPPORT BUT HE REALLY DID WANT TO BE DIPLOMATIC COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA AND AFGHANISTAN THEIR LEADERS ARE BATTLING HARD AGAINST VERY CORRUPT SYSTEMS AND COUNTRIES AND IN BOTH THEIR CASES THEY MADE SOME REMARKABLE STEPS FORWARD AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO KEEN TO WELCOME TO THE ANTIQUE UP CORRUPTION CONFERENCE HERE IN LONDON AS FOR THE AID BUDGET HE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO MIGRATION AND TERRORISM IN WHAT HE CALLED A DANGEROUS GLOBAL WORLD
THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN WANTED TO ASK ABOUT A NEW EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE WHICH WOULD STOP COMPANY'S POSTING THEIR WORKERS OVERSEAS ON RATES OF PAY THAT UNDERCUT WORKERS IN THE HOST COUNTRY WILL THE PRIME MINISTER CONFIRM THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WILL PROTECT WORKERS
WE'LL BACK THESE REFORMS TO STOP THIS UNDERCUTTING AND GROTESQUE EXPLOITATION OF MANY WORKERS ACROSS THIS CONTINENT
DAVID CAMERON DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH DETAIL TO HAND ABOUT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE POSTED WORKERS' DIRECTIVE BUT HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS LOOKING AT IT CLOSELY ANDY MOVED ON THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY IS CELEBRATE THEIR NATIONAL LIVING WAGE INTRODUCED BY JOY
THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND JEREMY CORBIN RANGE VERY WIDELY OVER E.U. DIRECTIVES OVERSEAS TERRITORIES THE CITY OF LONDON AND MARGARET THATCHER'S ERSTWHILE ECONOMIC ADVISOR THEY TOOK UP QUITE A LOT OF TIME AND THEN MANY OTHER M.P.S GOT COLD TOO NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME AS THE SPEAKER JOHN BERCOW WAITED UNTIL THE SESSION HAD LONG OVER RUN BEFORE CALLING LAST SLAY MY TIM FARRON
THERE HAD BEEN A BIT OF HECKLING US THE LIB DEM LEADER GOT UP THE SPEAKER TOOK OVER I DO HOWEVER IRRITATING THE HONOURABLE
IT'S A GOVERNMENT THAT'S VENTURES HE HAS A RIGHT
TIM FARRON SAID HE WAS FANTASTICALLY GRATEFUL TO THE SPEAKER AND WENT ON I HEARD THE PRIME MINISTER
ON TWO OCCASIONS THIS AFTERNOON CONGRATULATE THE NEW MAYOR OF LONDON FOR THE CAR AND I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT THAT
HE DID NOT HOWEVER APOLOGISED FOR GRACEFUL RACIST BY THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY CHOSE TO RUN IN THERE
WHAT DO YOU TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APOLOGISE FOR DELIBERATELY DIVIDING COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO WIN SHE
A GREAT WAY TO END THE SESSION GETTING A LESSON IN CLEAN CAMPAIGNING FROM THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LASHINGS OF GLEEFUL JEERING TIM FARRON SHRUG TO RESIGN UGLY AFTER ALL AT LEAST THEY HAD FLUSHED HIS HEAD DOWN THE TOILET OR STAMPED ON HIS PACKED LUNCH
SUSAN HERE REPORTING THERE YOU CAN OF COURSE HIM MORE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT AT EIGHT THIRTY ON LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL TIME NOEL HAVE MINUTES TO SEVEN
IT IS THE CANCER AT THE HEART OF SO MANY OF OUR PROBLEMS SO SAYS THE PRIME MINISTER AHEAD OF TODAY'S GLOBAL ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON HAVING BEEN CAUGHT ON CAMERA ACCUSING TWO OF ITS GUESTS THE LEADERS OF NIGERIA AND AFGHANISTAN OF LEADING COUNTRIES THAT ARE QUOTES FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT HE'S MOVED ON SOMEWHAT SAFER GROUND PROPOSALS ABOUT WHAT HE'LL ACTUALLY DO ABOUT IT AT THE TOP OF THE LIST TRANSPARENCY IN OTHER WORDS FORCING FOREIGN COMPANIES TO REVEAL THEIR TRUE OWNERS
SHE DO DONE IS HERE FROM THE PRESSURE GROUP GLOBAL WITNESS WHICH CAMPAIGNS ON THESE ISSUES LET'S BEGIN WITH THAT PROPOSAL HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SAY AT THE SUMMIT TODAY IS THAT THE WORLD IS TURNING TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY THE STEPS IN RELATION TO PROBABLY A REALLY GREAT AND ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER SAID THEY WILL APPLY TO OFFSHORE COMPANIES THAT ARE READY AND PROBABLY IN THE U.K. ALREADY HAD BEEN THE CRUCIAL POINT IN OTHER WORDS NOT NEW PURCHASES
BUT THE EXISTING ONE EXACTLY WE HAVE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION POUNDS ALREADY IN THE U.K. PROPERTY MARKET THAT OWNED OFFSHORE BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT STEPS MISSING SUCH AS OPENING UP U.K. TAX HIDDEN SO WHILE A WITNESS WOULD WELCOME THE MOVES THERE ARE SOME STUD STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN WHAT DO YOU HOPE WILL BE THE PRACTICAL EFFECT O.K. COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO SAY YES WE ALL THE TRUE OWNERS NOW ARE YOU HOPING THAT IN A WAY THAT MEANS THAT NOBODY CAN MONEY LAUNDER COS WE KNOW WHOSE MONEY IT ACTUALLY IS WHAT SCHEME
WHAT NONE OF THIS IS IS A SILVER BOWL THERE BUT WE WILL SEE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT EFFECTS SO WE WILL SEE IT BECOMING MUCH HARDER TO LAUNDER MONEY THROUGH THE U.K. PROPERTY MARKET WILL SEEN EFFECT HOPEFULLY ON HOUSE PRICES AND ALSO HOPEFULLY SEEN AFFECT OVERSEAS WITH LESS MONEY BEING STOLEN FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAD BEEN FUNNELLED INTO LONDON SO THIS WEEK YOU REGARD AS REALLY QUITE A RADICAL STEP IT'S CERTAINLY IT'S A VERY POSITIVE STEP AND WE WELCOME FROM THE GOVT NOW YOU MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY OF TAX HAVENS IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WHICH OF COURSE
HE'S IN CHARGE OF A THIRD OF TAX HAVENS AROUND THE WORLD COULD SIMPLY PASSED A LAW IT COULD SIMPLY IN THE U.K. PARLIAMENT SAY THIS HAS TO STOP IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR CERTAINLY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS IN THE PAST USE ITS POWERS TO COMPEL THE TAX HAVENS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND WE WOULD ASK THEM TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR IN RELATION TO THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION WHY DON'T
WELL IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM THEY HAVE SAID THEY WANT PUBLIC REGISTER HE TETRIS AND SOME MOVES HAVE BEEN MADE AND WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE SUMMIT TODAY BUT THERE IS MORE THAT THEY CAN DO BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF COURSE WHEN HE DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE HEARD AT LEAST NOT BY ANYONE OF HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WHEN HE SAID THEY WERE FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT IS THERE A SENSE TODAY THAT THE WORLD WORKS AND LONG STANDS ALONGSIDE NIGERIAN AFGHANISTAN
ALL THAT THERE ARE AS IT WERE YOU KNOW BLOWING A RASPBERRY AT THEM WE CERTAINLY AM COUNTRY SUCH AS AN IDEA IN AFGHANISTAN ARE BATTLING A HISTORY OF CORRUPTION BUT THE CURRENT'S REGIMES THEY'RE THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN REALLY POSITIVE STEPS TO FIGHT THE PROBLEM AND GOVERNMENTS ARE JUST THE U.K. CAN'T SHE BE A CAUTIOUS ABOUT TURNING THEIR EYE TO THEM CRITICISING THEM GIVEN THE ROLE THAT WE'VE PAID IN FACILITATING A NEIGHBOURING CORRUPTION UP TO DATE SO FINAL THOUGHT THEY MAY BE CYNICS WHO SAY WELL IT'S ALL FOR PIA THIS SUMMIT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING
WORTHWHILE SUMMIT BUT YES HAVE AN ARGUMENT WHETHER IT'S GOING FAR ENOUGH YES ABSOLUTELY THE WORLD ATTENDING TO A TRANSPARENCY LET'S NOT LEAVE THEIR TAX ENDS BEHIND CHEATED UM FOR GLOBAL WITNESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY'S IN A STATE OF DEADLOCK AFTER THE FIRST MINISTER LABOUR'S CARWYN JONES WAS BLOCKED FROM BEING RE APPOINTED LABOUR ARE JUST SHORT OF A MAJORITY IN THE ASSEMBLY FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S ELECTION RESULTS WERE JOINED FROM SWANSEA BY THE LABOUR M.P. AND SHADOW WELSH SECRETARY NEAR GRIFFITH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED FOR RELATIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY BEING RATHER DIFFERENT AFTER THE ELECTION RESULTS
WELL WE HAD A GOOD ELECTION RESULT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF LABOUR GAINING TWENTY NINE OR FORTY SEATS WHAT IS BELIEVABLE AS THE HYPOCRITICAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE PLY COMING LATER LEANNE WOOD I MEAN IS THAT HERE'S THE LEADER WHO WAS STANDING ON THE PLATFORM AND CLAIMING TO BE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE LEADER SHIP
DEBATES ARE ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND NOW ACTIVELY SEEKING SUPPORT FROM THE CONSERVATIVES ARE NEW CLIP WELL HANG ON WHAT WHAT PLY CUMBRAE HAVE DONE IS PUT THEIR LEADER FORWARD AS FIRST MINISTER WHICH IS IN A PERFECTLY OBVIOUS THING FOR A POLITICAL PARTY TO DO
WELL THEY'VE ONLY WON SIX OUT OF THE FORTY CONSTITUENCIES AND THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT THE QUESTION IS WHAT SORT OF PROGRAMME IS THAT GOING TO BE ONE MINUTE WE HAVE PLIED COME SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE DOCTORS AND THEN WE HAVE THEM TALKING TO THE CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE
PROMISING AND HAVE PRICE IN THEIR MANIFESTO TO CUT A BILLION POUNDS OFF THE WELSH N.H.S. PARTY THAT STANDS FOR INDEPENDENCE GOING IN WITH UKIP WHO CAN SO THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN FAVOUR OF THE CURRENT PROPOSALS ON DEVOLUTION YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT THIS IS NOT STABILITY THIS IS NOT OFFERING THE WELSH PEOPLE AND THE BUSINESS OF THE CHART TO SEE THEIR NEEDS AT THE CHARGES THAT HAS BEEN PLACED AGAINST
AGAINST LABOUR IN WALES IS THAT THERE IS AN ENTITLEMENT TO GARB AND THAT HAS BEEN SAID BY BY PLIED CUMBRAE BY YOU KEPT BY THE TORIES THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN POWER FOR SO LONG YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO TALK IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BECAUSE THE MAKE UP OF THE ASSEMBLY IS DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT WAS NOW THERE WAS A REQUEST FROM CLYDE COME HE WASN'T THERE TO POSTPONE THE VOTE ON THE FIRST MINISTER TO ALLOW TALKS TO TAKE PLACE
LABOUR REFUSED WELL THE SITUATION IN THE WELSH GOVERNMENT IS THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD AN OVERALL MAJORITY WE'VE ALWAYS HAD ABOUT THIRTY MAYBE A BIT LESS
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT A PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE WELSH PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE HERE WE HAVE SOMEBODY PRANCING ABOUT WANTING TO BE FIRST MINISTER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT
PICK A PROGRAMME COME ON WHY DON'T YOU KNOW I'VE GONE WHY WERE YOU NOT PREPARED TO POSTPONE THE VOTE ON THE PRIME MINISTER TO DISCUSS YOUR PROGRAMME OF GOVERNMENT BUT WE'VE HAD AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST WITH DIFFERENT PARTIES AND WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ON WHAT I AREAS WE COMPROMISE ON WHERE WE'VE MADE CONCESSIONS AND THAT'S A DIVE AT ALL HE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE NOW IF YOU WOULD WANT TO PROPOSE SOMETHING FOR THE WELSH PEOPLE DO YOU NEED TO LEARN TO DO THAT SORT OF NEGOTIATION
AND SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU UP YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO TAKE AT ALL AT A DIFFERENT STANCE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AS YOU FACE THIS FORTHCOMING TERM IN THE WELSH ASSEMBLY THOUGH THIS THERE'S NOTHING IN WHAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT HE'S DIFFERENT FROM HOW YOU HAVE GOVERNED BEFORE
WE'VE HAD MANY TIMES WHERE WE HAVE MADE DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS WE'VE MADE DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE LIB DEMS WE'VE MADE AGREEMENTS WITH PLY COME AND YOU CAN SEE THAT KIRSTY WILLIAMS THE LIB DEM VOTED WITH LABOUR ONLY YESTERDAY SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE THOSE AGREEMENTS BUT WE DO HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF THE SORT OF PROGRAMME THAT
PEOPLE HAVE VOTED US IN ON AND WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DELIVER SO IF PARTIES WANT TO JOIN IN ON THAT OR LOOK AT THAT THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF BASES THAT WE'RE GOING TO START FROM SO THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO COME TO YOU NOT THE OTHER WAY WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER WELSH PEOPLE SOMETHING WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO WHAT THEY VOTED FOR

THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP APPEARS TO HAVE SOFTENED HIS STANCE ON A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL TO PAN MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THE U.S. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS LAST NIGHT HE DESCRIBED THE PLAN AS JUST A SUGGESTION IT'S TO TRUMP'S COMMENT SCUM JUST HOURS BEFORE A MUCH ANTICIPATED MEETING WITH SENIOR PARTY MEMBERS WHO OPPOSE HIS NOMINATION HE'S ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOAP
THIS PROMISES TO BE A DIFFICULT AND SPIKY MEETING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MISTER TRUMP AT THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON RUN DEEP THEY'RE PROFOUNDLY OPPOSED TO MANY OF HIS POLICIES AND HAVE BEEN APPALLED AT SOME OF THE DIVISIVE RHETORIC THAT HAS PROPELLED HIM TO BEING THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE
MISTER TRUMP THOUGH HAS BROUGHT IN MILLIONS OF SUPPORTERS MANY OF THEM NEW TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE ONE OF HIS UNCOMPROMISING MESSAGES ON IMMIGRATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SOFTENED WHEN LAST NIGHT HE SAID THAT HIS PROPOSAL TO BAN ALL MUSLIMS FROM THE U.S. WAS ONLY A SUGGESTION
HIS COMMENTS CAME AFTER THE NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OF LONDON SIDIQUE KHAN DESCRIBED THE POLICY AS IGNORANT BUT IT MISTER TRUMP CLIMBS DOWN TOO MUCH FROM HIS TOUGH POSITIONS TO WIN THE LEADERSHIP OVER HE RISK ALIENATING THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUT HIM WHERE HE IS

NUMBER TEN HAVE RULED OUT THE PRIME MINISTER DEBATING AGAINST BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL COVE IN A TELEVISION DEBATE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM AND TENSE OR SAID THEY DID NOT WANT THE T.B. DEBATE TURNED INTO A BLUE ON BLUE FIGHT
VOTE LEAVE HEARD EARLIER ACCUSED I.T.T. OF TAKING SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE AFTER THE BROADCASTER EXCLUDED THE CAMPAIGN GROUP WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN OFFICIAL DESIGNATION FROM A PROGRAMME FEATURING THE PRIME MINISTER INSTEAD OF INVITING A MEMBER A BOAT LEAVE TO APPEAR ALONGSIDE DAVID CAMERON THE BROADCASTER HAS ASKED THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL FARRAJ I.T.V. INSISTS IT'S OFFERED THE GROUP A SLOT ON ANOTHER PROGRAMME OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MASON REPORTS
THIS ROW MATTERS BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS ONCE AGAIN THE CENTRAL DISPUTE AMONGST THOSE WANTING THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NIGEL FARRAJ AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY TO THEIR CAUSE VOTE YOU THINK HE WILL PUT OFF THOSE WHO ARE YET TO DECIDE WHO TO SUPPORT AND SO ARE LIVID THAT THE UKIP LEADER
WILL APPEAR ON THE SAME I.T.V. PROGRAMME AS THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT MONTH THEY WANTED BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO TO GO ON INSTEAD BUT THERE'S LONG BEEN THOUGHT DOWNING STREET WOULD BE RELUCTANT FOR DAVID CAMERON TO BE SEEN TO BE SO PUBLICLY AT ODDS WITH CABINET COLLEAGUES AND ANGRY AND ILL TEMPERED EMAIL SENT LATE LAST NIGHT

IN TWO THOUSAND H. HE GAVE A PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF OUR EFFORTS TO OVERCOME DEPRESSION IN HER BOOK SHOOT THE DAMN DOG THANK YOU CURRY IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST
IF YOU THINK SOMETHING THAT YOU HEAR ON THIS PROGRAMME IS UNFAIR OR BIASED WHO SHOULD DECIDE IF YOU A B. B. C. IS WASTING PUBLIC MONEY OR COMPETING UNFAIRLY POWER SHOULD THAT BE STOPPED IF YOU WANT THIS ORGANISATION TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT
YOU CAN ENSURE THAT IT DOES HAPPEN THERE'S ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AT THE HEART OF TODAY'S PRO PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE B.B.C.
JOIN THE MALIGNED BY LORD LEICESTER THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER WHO THREATENED TO TABLE A BILL IN THE LORDS TO CHALLENGE WHAT HE SEES AS A GOVERNMENT THREAT TO THE B.B.C. AND ITS INDEPENDENCE MORNING TO YOU LORD LEICESTER GOOD MORNING A SERIES OF CONCESSIONS TO THE B. B. CITY AND ITS SUPPORTERS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE WE WERE BRIEFED ABOUT THEM OVERNIGHT WILL GET THEM CONFIRMED IN AN HOUR OR TWO OR YOU NOW RELAXED
I'M RELIEVED AT SOME OF THE CONCESSIONS CERTAINLY OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO READ THE WHITE PAPER BUT THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISE JUST NOW WORK VERY WELL RAISED
WITH ALICE IN WONDERLAND OR THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS WHEN YOU REMEMBER HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID TO HER
THE QUESTION IS WHO IS TO BE MASTER THAT IS ALL AND THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHO IS TO DECIDE
HOW ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD IT BE MINISTERS WEARING THE MEDIEVAL KINGS ROBES THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE DOING WHATEVER THEY LIKE IN THE TROUT
OR SHOULD IT BE PARLIAMENT OR WHO SHOULD IT BE
NOW MY BELIEF IS THAT IT'S A NONSENSE I SHARE THIS BELIEF WITH NORMAN FOWLER AND OTHER COLLEAGUES ACROSS PARTIES IT IS A NONSENSE TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW MINISTERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CHILD
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PARLIAMENTARY DECISION EITHER WAY SO THAT'S STEP ONE NOW THE OTHER STEP IS WHO ACTUALLY RUNS THE B. B. C. DAY TODAY IT SEEMS THE PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING A SINGLE BOARD RATHER THAN TOO IS THERE ARE NOW HE'S A HE'S A PRETTY REASONABLE IDEA THE ANXIETY OF SOME HAS BEEN WHO
ACTUALLY NOMINATES THEIR PEOPLE TO THAT BOARD AND IF IT IS THE GOVERNMENT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THEY ACTUALLY GET TO NOMINATE YES
AND ONE ASKS THE VIEWER WHAT GOOD REASON IS THERE BEFORE ALLOWING MINISTERS TO MAKE POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS TO A NEW STRONG UNITARY BALD
WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR B. B. C. CONTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT NOW SAYS THERE WILL BE FEWER THAN HALF THE APPOINTEES SO IN OTHER WORDS IT CAN'T STACK THE BOARD WITH A MAJORITY IN HIS OWN FAVOUR YEAH BUT WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY AT ALL
WHO WOULD DO IT IF THEY DON'T WELL WHY WHY CAN ONE NOT HAVE THE COMMISSIONER FOR PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS I THINK PETER RIDDLE OFFICE HOLDER USING A TRANSPARENT AND OPEN PROCESS
WITH THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD BEING ANNOUNCED SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET WHAT THEIR QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD BE THEY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRIME MINISTER MAKES THE APPOINTMENT O.K. WHAT I THINK THE B.B.C. HAVE LONG RESISTED IS HAVING THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE GO THROUGH ITS ACCOUNTS THAT WILL BE DONE I THINK NOW IN THESE PROPOSALS BUT THEY COME AND SEEMS TO HAVE BACKED OFF THE IDEA OF GETTING STARS PRESENTERS TO PUBLISH THEIR PAY PACKETS WELCOME NOT WELCOME
WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE AUDITING THERE'S EVERYTHING WRONG IF IT INTERFERES WITH EDITORIAL DECISION TAKING OF THE INDEPENDENT FOR THE BOARD SO I THINK DETAIL HAS GOT TO BE WORKED OUT
RATHER SOON WHAT ABOUT THE CHILD AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ONE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE IS THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE AGAIN INTERFERING IN THAT WAY CAN I JUST SAY TO YOU WHAT MY BILLY'S TRYING TO DO
OF COURSE YOU CAN AND YOU TELL US THAT YOU'RE PROCEEDING WITH IT HAVE YOU YES NO I'M CERTAINLY PROCEEDING WITH IT WHEN I SAY I NOT JUST ME AND MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LORD'S ACROSS PARTIES THERE'S VERY STRONG SUPPORT AS DAVID PUTTNAM JOHN BIRT FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL WAS NORMAN FOWLER AND TELL US WHAT IS IN IT
ALL IT DOES BUT IT IS TO SET SOME STANDARDS BASIC PRINCIPLES THAT THE CHILD AND MINISTERS AND THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE B. B. C. MUST COMPLY WITH
VERY SIMPLE PUT SIMPLY YOU DO NOT TRUST MINISTERS NOW ONE REASON PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T TRUST MINISTERS I'LL GIVE YOU CHANCE AWAY IS THIS FIVE YEARLY REVIEW OF THE B. B. C. A SORT OF SUGGESTION AND EVERY SO OFTEN AND VERY CLOSE TO AN ELECTION THEY CAN SAY YOU KNOW YOU BETTER BEHAVE OR WE MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY
YES AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO IT'S NOT VERY HIGH AMONG MEMBERS OF THE B.B.C. STAFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY WHICH AT LAST MADE TO SOME EXTENT BE DISSIPATED
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE CHARTER SHOULD BE FOR ELEVEN YEARS THE GOVERNMENT AGREES WITH THAT THAT THERE SHALL BE NO BREAK CLAUSE OR THREAT HALFWAY THROUGH AT ELECTION TIME OR JUST AFTER THE NEXT ELECTION
AND THAT THERE MUST BE A PROPER FLOW OF REVENUE FOR THE B. B. C. LOOK AT THAT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AGREED AT THE MOMENT BUT I BELIEVE YOU MUST PUT A FENCE AROUND THE B. B. C. TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OR LESS WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR CRITIC AT THE B.B.C. LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THANK YOU
IT IS NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEVEN LUCY BURTON IS BACK WITH THE BUSINESS NEWS AND TALK TALK RESULT THAT'S RIGHT MAKE THE COMPANY'S MANAGED A MODEST TWO MILLION POUND NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR TO THE END OF MARCH THAT'S DOWN FROM SEVENTY TWO MILLION LAST YEAR AFTER THEY SUFFERED A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED CYBER ATTACK LAST OCTOBER IT COST THE COMPANY UP TO SIXTEEN MILLION POUNDS SALES HOWEVER UP TWO PER CENT
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE DIDO HARDING JOINS ME FROM THE CITY GOOD MORNING YOUR REACTION TO THE RESULTS FIRST PLEASE YOU ARE YOU SATISFIED I'M ACTUALLY VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE WAY THE BUSINESS HAS BOUNCED BACK SO STRONGLY IN THE LAST QUARTER WE'VE RECORDED OUR LOWEST EVER CHURN IN ART HISTORY IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS THE CUSTOMER BASE IS STABILISED AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE REALLY APPRECIATED ARE OPEN AND HONEST APPROACH IN HOW WE TRIED TO LOOK AFTER THEM THROUGH THE SIDE
BECAUSE OF COURSE HE DID LOSE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AT THE TIME DIDN'T YOU HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT IN ENSURING THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN WELL AS WE SAID SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THAT WE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SPENDING ON SECURITY WE TAKE THIS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY AND OUR CUSTOMERS SEE THAT WHICH IS WHY ACTUALLY BRAND TRUSTIN TALKTALK IS HIGHER NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE CYBER ATTACK PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY SEE HOW SERIOUSLY WERE TAKING THIS ISSUE
AND OF COURSE AS YOU MENTION YOU'VE BEEN ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS CHURN IS LOW BUT THERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS STILL BY COMMENTATORS ON MY KNEE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP CURRENT ONES THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS AS I SAID WE'VE JUST RECORDED THE LOWEST EVER CHURN IN THE COMPANY'S HISTORY
ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE BOUGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE LAST QUARTER THAT'S THE STRONGEST QUARTER THAT WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR AREN'T SAID THEIR BUSINESS REALLY IS BOUNCING BACK I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT TALKTALK CAN ALWAYS DO MORE TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BUT A LONG TERM RELENTLESS APPROACH TO IMPROVING CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE IS REALLY STARTING TO BEAR FRUIT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THESE NUMBERS
NOW OFCOM IS CLAMPING DOWN ON WHAT IT CALLS HEADLINE GRABBING MISLEADING PRICE CLAIMS BY TELECOMS COMPANIES
TALKTALK FALL INTO LINE OVER THAT DO YOU THINK WELL ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN AHEAD OF OFCOM WE'VE BEEN LOBBYING OFCOM TO DO EXACTLY THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S WRONG AND WE ARE HIS COMP CULPABLE AS ANYONE ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY IN CREATING PACKAGES THAT CONFUSE PEOPLE AND SO ACTUALLY I'M DELIGHTED THAT OFCOM THE ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY HAVE DECIDED TO CLAMP DOWN ON THIS AND TALK TO WILL BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF MAKING IT SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE GENUINELY SAVE THE MONEY
DADDY HIDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN FROM GLASGOW TO PORT TALBOT SOUTHAMPTON LONDON AND STANFORD LE HOPE IN ESSEX TEN URBAN AREAS IN BRITAIN HAVE BEEN NAMED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION IS FAILING TO MEET AIR QUALITY STANDARD SPECIFICALLY FINE PARTICLE POLLUTION WHICH IS BLAMED FOR THOUSANDS OF DEATHS EVERY YEAR
WE'RE JOINED BY LIZ HUTCHINS YOU SENIOR CAMPAIGNER AT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MORNING MORNING OR DID THAT DID THIS LIST COME AS A SURPRISE TO YOU BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME BIG CITIES WHICH WE ALL WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BUT SOME SMALLER URBAN AREAS AS WELL NOT AT ALL WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT AIR POLLUTION IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM AND BOTH THE PARTICULATE AIR POLLUTION THAT THIS WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION REPORT IS FOCUSING ON BUT ALSO NITROGEN DIOXIDE
AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT AIR POLLUTION IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO HEALTH IT'S IN FACT THE BIGGEST KILLER AFTER SMOKING IN THE U.K. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT ASTHMA AND IT'S ALSO LINKED TO LUNG CANCER AND HEART DISEASE AND WE KNOW THIS IS VERY WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE U.K. AND URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED AND THIS IS PRIMARILY IS IT THE SORT OF POLLUTION ABOUT CARS AND DIESEL CARS RATHER THAN INDUSTRY
WELL AIR POLLUTION IS IS CAUSED PRIMARILY TO BURNING FOSSIL FUELS IN THAT SPACE THROUGH OUR CARS IN YES DIESEL CARS ARE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM BUT ALSO BURNING FOSSIL FUELS IN POWER STATIONS AND IN USE IN INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF GETTING TO GRIPS WITH EXACTLY THIS SORT OF POLLUTION THERE FINE PARTICULATE MATTER AND WHAT IT DOES TO PEOPLE'S RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS
IF THERE ARE DIFFICULT CHOICES THAT THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO MOVE AWAY FROM DIESEL CARS COULD YOU SEE WHY THERE MIGHT NEED TO BE A PUSH THEN TOWARDS PETROL RATHER THAN ELECTRIC WHICH IS PERHAPS A FURTHER AWAY HORIZON
WELL LOOK YOU KNOW FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR DIE EARLY BECAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION AND WE REALLY NEED A SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO WORK AND PETROL WAS JUST GOING TO FURTHER CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM WHAT WE'RE CALLING FOR IS A SCRAPPAGE SCHEME FOR DIESEL CARS TO GET THE WORST POLLUTING VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD QUICKLY BUT WE ALSO NEED CLEAN AS ZONES IN EVERY MAJOR CITY THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE CITIES AND ACTUALLY EVERYBODY
IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY SHUT OUT HAVE A RIGHT TO CLEANER AND THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW MOVING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO WALK AND CYCLE IN OUR MAJOR CITIES AND INVESTING IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT REALLY CAN HELP WITH THE ALTERNATIVES AS WELL AS HOW THEY WORKED THEY WOULD BAN DIESEL CARS
ALTOGETHER FROM AREAS AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY DO IT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF DOING IT BUT ACTUALLY CLEAN AS OWNS ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS FROM THE WORST POLLUTION SO YES YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DIESEL AT VEHICLES IN THOSE AREAS AT ALL AND HE WOULD INSTEAD HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND YOU KNOW PUBLIC TRANSPORT THAT'S GOING TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE AWAY FROM THOSE WEST POLLUTING PROBLEMS
LIZ HUTCHENS OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH THANK YOU THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY SEVEN NOW WE JOURNALISTS OFTEN GETS SOME PRETTY LIVELY OFTEN SOME ANGRY EMAILS LATE AT NIGHT FROM POLITICIANS AND THEIR AIDS BUT LAST NIGHT POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTS RECEIVE ONE THAT HE'S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY IT ACCUSED DOWNING STREET OF FIXING WHO WILL APPEAR IN THE T.V. DEBATES ON OUR FUTURE IN OR OUT OF THE E.U.
BUT WENT MUCH FURTHER IT ACCUSED I. T. V. WHO ANNOUNCED THEIR PLANS FOR A DEBATE BETWEEN MY CAMERA AND MY PHARAOH'S YESTERDAY OF LYING ABOUT THEIR PLANS AND I QUOTE EFFECTIVELY JOINING AT THE INN CAMPAIGN AND GOES ON TO WARM AT THE PEOPLE IN NUMBER TEN
WON'T BE THERE FOR LONG WHAT DO THEY STAND BY THOSE CLAIMS LET'S SPEAK TO A SPOKESPERSON FOR VOTE LEAVE ROBERT OXLEY IS DOMINIC COMMON CUMMINGS THE DIRECTOR OF YOUR ORGANISATION THE CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR RIGHT DO YOU STAND BY THOSE CLAIMS
I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT NUMBER TEN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PICK ITS OPPONENTS IN THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE THAT IS NOT HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS AND YOU BELIEVE I DID
OR I T. V. WERE ASSURED A NUMBER OF STAFF THAT THEY WERE
WANTING NIGEL FARAGE IN AN ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE PRIME MINISTER I THINK THERE IS A RATINGS WAR BETWEEN THE BROADCASTERS HERE AT ALL TIMES AND NUMBER TEN HAVE CLEARLY GOT A STRATEGY THEY HAVE DECIDED THEY WOULD LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER NEAR THE END OF THIS REFERENDUM TO DEBATE
NIGEL FARAGE THAT IS THAT AIM IN THIS CAMP WOULD BE THE QUESTION ARE YOU THINK YOU THINK CLEARLY YOU THINK I.T.V. ARE WRONG CLEARLY YOU THINK DOWNING STREET ARE WRONG HARDLY SURPRISING AS YOUR OPPOSING THEM BUT YOU ARE ACCUSING THE MAJOR BROADCASTER IN THIS COUNTRY OF LYING
I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAN THEY ARE TRYING TO PICK THEIR APPARENT THAT AS WHAT GOING I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE LYING OH YOU SAY MISTER OXLEY THAT THEY LIED OR AREN'T YOU
I HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BROADCAST ON THIS BUT WE DO KNOW IN EVERY DISCUSSION THAT HAS HAPPENED EVERY REPORTS HAPPENED THAT WE KNOW THAT NUMBER TEN DOES NOT WANT TO DEBATE
THE LEAN TO TALK ABOUT NUMBER TEN I'M NOT VERY KEEN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A SENIOR BOAT LEAVES OR WHAT SORRY LET BUT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FINISH THE DAMAGED IN SIGHT LET'S FINISH THE QUESTION
YOU'RE IN A MEMO TO JOURNALIST YOU ACCUSED A VERY SENIOR JOURNALIST ROBERT PESTON FORMALLY THE BABY C. NOR HAVE I. T. V. OF CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO JOIN THE EURO AND ONLY T. V. OF JOINING THE OFFICIAL IN CAMPAIGN HE AND EH OF COURSE VIGOROUSLY DENY THIS WILL YOU NOW APOLOGISE
ONE LOOK THERE'S GOING TO BE A REFERENDUM ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE BEFORE THAN THERE WILL BE THESE DEBATES AND THESE DEBATES WILL AFFECT HOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE VOTES A GROUP IN THE MIDDLE UNDECIDED VOTERS AS A DESPERATE BE HE SHOULD BE HE SHOULD BE FOR THE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGNS THE SIDE WHICH PEOPLE THEY PUT UP WHO BEST BUT LEE
CAN ACTUALLY SWING THOSE PHOTOS AND I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE BUT THERE'S A CONVENTION IN THESE INTERVIEWS I ASK QUESTIONS AND YOU AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THEM NOW IF THE ANSWER IS NO I WON'T APOLOGISE THAT'S FINE THEN WE KNOW THEY'LL BE PUT IT AGAIN WILL YOU WON'T YOU APOLOGISE I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR WHAT I THINK THAT NUMBER TEN HAVE TRIED TO DO HERE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN INTO THAT AND I WON'T APOLOGISE FOR BEING CRITICAL OF V. FOR SAYING ONE THING AND PUBLICAN
ROUND THE BACK ALLOWING NUMBER TEND TO CHOOSE THEIR OPPONENT IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT'S NOT HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS THEY TRIED IT IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS THE DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING WITH HER BABY SAFE AND I HOPE THAT THE B.B.C.
HOLD FIRM AND ITS DISCUSSIONS BUT YOU NIGEL SARGE YOU KIP HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN TERMS OF WINNING IN WINNING THIS REFERENDUM SECURING ACTUAL DEBATES ABOUT GETTING OUT THERE TO LIVE WITH US BUT IN TERMS OF THAT UNDECIDED VOTES THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD ACTUALLY
PUT THAT MESSAGE FOR HER MOST LIKE TO WIN THAT REFERENDUM THAT SHOULD BE A DISCUSSION FOR DESIGNATOR CAMPAIGN AND NUMBER TEN ULTIMATELY THEY WANT TO BE DEBATING NIGEL PROUD YOU'LL FOUND THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK IN THIS CAMPAIGN
BUT IF YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON TO WIN THOSE SWING VOTERS AGAIN WOULD THANK YOU BUT YOU MADE THE POINT WELL IF BUT THERE'S STILL ONE OTHER THING IN THIS MEMO I T. V. IT SAYS WILL FACE CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS ALMOST
IT IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES IF I.T.V. HAVE SOMEHOW TRIED TO HELP NUMBER TEN BY ALLOWING THEM TO PICK WHAT ARE THOSE CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THAT AND SAY WHY DID THE BROADCASTER ACTUALLY GO ONTO THE SIDE
OF ONE OF THE SITE AT ONE OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN COS THAT'S WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE WHAT ALL THE TIME WITH THE PRIME WAS AS I SAID IT WILL BE PLACING THE OBVIOUS IF IT AFTER A VOTE
THE BROADCASTERS HAVE SOMEHOW TRY TO ASSIST NUMBER TEN IN THE SYSTEM AND PUTTING FORWARD
THEIR CASE TO THE OPPONENT OF THEIR CHOICE IT IS NOT GOING TO LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THEM JUST TO FINDHORN IS IT IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR A CLOSE FRIEND OF MICHAEL GOES A MAN WHO MIGHT BE IN DOWNING STREET IF THERE'S A CHANGE OF REGIME AND DAVID CAMERON LOSES THIS CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN PEOPLE IN NUMBER TEN TO THREATEN PEOPLE IN I.T.V. ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES NOT DOING WHAT YOU WANT
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS FRIGHTENING PEOPLE IN NUMBER BUT IT IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS LOGICAL FAT BUT
I.T.V. AS A BROADCASTER HAVE FAILED TO DO THEIR JOB YOU FAILED TO STAND UP TO NUMBER TEN WHO ARE TRYING TO PICK THEIR OPPONENT WHO HAVE FAILED TO ALLOW THAT THE REFERENDUM DEBATE IT IN A WAY THAT
BOTH SIDES PUT FORWARD THEIR STRONGEST PROPONENTS TO WIN HER OVER THAT SMALL VOTES THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE ROBERT KNOX OUT THERE THERE'LL BE VOTING EVEN BOATING FOR FOR YOU KIP THANK YOU THANK YOU PETER SHOULD BE FED ABOUT RON OBVIOUSLY A VOTE LEAVE THANK YOU

LIKE SERIOUSLY PEOPLE CRIED WITH YOU COS I'M NOT IT'S NOT EASY BEING SOMETHING MUST BE DONE VERY URGENTLY ABOUT OF THEM HAVE BEEN SOMETHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT I JUST NEED TO SEE HOW A FIVER
UNSURPRISINGLY PRESENT A BARIS ANTI CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN HAS POPULAR SUPPORT WOBBLY ACTUALLY TAKE FOR THE CAMPAIGN TO SUCCEED KENNY OR TEN YOUR DOOR IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST
WE NEED TO THINK DECISIVE HARD MEASURE STEPS PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO JAIL
LIKE YESTERDAY THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM MYTHS TO WORK SWIFTLY WE NEED TO SEE CREDIBLE LEADERSHIP
KICK UP POSITIONS WITH WITHIN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND THAT'S THE POINT NIGERIA'S ANTI CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO BE FAR GREATER THAN JUST ONE MAN FURIOUS PRESIDENT BARI SINCERITY AND THE ISSUE BUT EVERYONE AGREES THAT HE WILL NEED ALL THE HELP PICKING DES INCLUDING FROM BRITAIN
MARTIN PATIENTS REPORTING FROM NIGERIA JOINED ON THE LINE NOW FROM WESTMINSTER BY THE CABINET OFFICE MINISTER MATTHEW HANCOCK MORNINGS YOU MISTER HANG ON IT WASN'T THE CLEVEREST IDEA TO START SUMMIT BY INSULTING THE LEADERS OF TWO COUNTRIES HIS HELP YOU NEED SO MUCH WAS IT
THOSE PRESIDENTS ARE COMING PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION IN THEIR COUNTRIES AND AS THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA HIMSELF SAID A PRIME MINISTER IS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A GLOBAL SUMMIT TO TACKLE CORRUPTION AND FRANKLY IN THE PAST THE WORLD US TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THIS PROBLEM AND JUST COS IT'S HARD TO TACKLE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T SO TAKE THE PROBLEM PART OF THE PROBLEM FACED IS OF COURSE IN NIGERIA ELSEWHERE AN AWFUL LOT OF THAT CORRUPT MONEY ENDS UP HERE IN LONDON OFTEN DESCRIBED AS THE MONEY LAUNDERING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IN BRITISH PROPERTY IN BRITISH CARS IN BRITISH SCHOOLS WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT YES WELL I WAS JUST GOING TO GO ON TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION AT HOME SO THAT PEOPLE CAN'T HIDE THEIR ILL GOTTEN GAINS HERE WE IS THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR SURE
BUT SOMETIMES THE THE THE GAME'S WRONGLY MADE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN HIDDEN IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD INCLUDING IN THE U.K. TALK US THROUGH HOW THAT WILL WORK IN PRACTICE SO O.K. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER WHO THE TRUE OWNERS OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF PROPERTY IN LONDON AND ELSEWHERE ARE
HOW DOES THAT THEN LEADS TO STOPPING THEM HIDING THEIR MONEY HERE WOULD BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY IS CENTRAL TO KNOWING WHERE MONEY HAS BEEN HIDDEN SO NEXT MONTH WE'RE GOING TO PUBLISH THE OWNERSHIP AND THE ULTIMATE OWNERSHIP OF ALL U.K. COMPANIES WITH THEIR FIRST G. TWENTY COUNTRY TO DO
WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYBODY WHO OWNS PROPERTY IN THE U.K. THERE'S ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROPERTIES OWNED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES AND ANYBODY WHO SELLS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS TO DECLARE WHO THE ULTIMATE OWNER OF THAT COMPANY IS COS IN THE PAST ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS HAS BEEN THAT THEY'VE BEEN ESSENTIALLY ANONYMOUS COMPANIES SO IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
THEN YOU CAN THEN YOU CAN ANONYMOUSLY STORE IT ELSEWHERE AND CAMPAIGNERS HAVE WELCOME ALICE BUT ONE THING THAT THEY POINT TO IS THE FACT THAT STILL THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ISN'T EFFECT IN CHARGE OF MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE STILL INVOLVED IN MONEY LAUNDERING SO THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS THE CAYMAN ISLANDS WILL NOT JOIN YOUR PLANS FOR SHARING INFORMATION ARE YOU AT ALL TEMPTED TO USE THEIR POWERS THAT MINISTERS DO YOU HAVE OVER OVERSEAS BRITISH TERRITORIES TO SIMPLY ORDER THEM TO DO SO
THAT WOULD BE ANTI DEMOCRATIC BUT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS MADE A HUGE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS WITH THE OVERSEAS TERRITORIES WHO ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE A REGISTER OF BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE OF THAT INFORMATION WITH FORTY JURISDICTION SO THAT WE CAN SOW THE AUTHORITIES CAN SEE WHERE
THIS OWNERSHIP AND TAKE ACTION SO IT'S ANTI DEMOCRATIC BUT MINISTERS IN THE PAST HAVE DONE THIS ON THE DEATH PENALTY THEY HAVE DONE IT ON RIGHTS OF HOMOSEXUALS ON AN ISSUE THAT THE PRIME MINISTRY SAYS HE'S A CANCER AT THE HEART OF THE WORLD ECONOMY WASN'T IT RIGHT TO SIMPLY ORDER THEM WILL BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO COME WITH US ON THIS JOURNEY AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY THIS FURTHER PROGRESS WITH CAME AND YOU MENTION AND IN ALL OF THE OTHER
TERRITORIES ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND THE KEY THING IS HERE THAT THE WORLD HAS GOT TO ACT TOGETHER ACTUALLY THE BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AFTER THE ACTION THAT THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK WILL BE MORE TRANSPARENT THE MANY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES INCLUDING STATES OF AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS O.K. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORLD MOVES TOGETHER TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE AFGHAN PRESIDENT AFTER TEN PAST EIGHT

A POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE IS UNDERWAY IN BRAZIL THE BRAZILIAN PARLIAMENT IS VOTING ON WHETHER TO BEGIN THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT DE L'AMOUR RESET SHE'S CLAIMED THAT SHE'S THE VICTIM OF A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED COO HER CRITICS INSIST THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING CORRUPTION IN A COUNTRY FACING
ECONOMIC A TRAUMA WORLD THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE BRAZILIAN PARLIAMENT ARE UNDER WAY NOW AND WE CAN BRIEFLY LISTEN INTO THEM IT WAS BAD AND SILVER BOWL NO WAY LES YOU PUT IT THE POORLY AND OUR CORRESPONDENT WHERE A DAVIES HE'S BEEN FOLLOWING THE ENTIRE SAGA REPORTS FROM BRASILIA
BRAZILIAN POLITICIANS LOVE TO TALK A.T. ONE SENATORS GIVEN FIFTEEN MINUTES EACH EQUALS MORE THAN TWENTY HOURS OF DEBATE
ATTEMPT TO CURTAIL THEIR ALLOTTED TIME FOR LARGELY ON DEAF EARS AFTER ALL THE CHANCE TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T COME AROUND VERY OFTEN
GENEROUS THEIR FACES FORMAL CHARGES THAT SHE ILLEGALLY USE STATE BANKS TO CONCEAL THE SIZE OF THE DEFICIT CHARGES WOULD SHE DISMISSES AS BASELESS AND AS SHE TOLD ME IN A RECENT INTERVIEW ARE NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXCUSE USED BY HER POLITICAL ENEMIES
FORCE FORCED FROM OFFICE YOUR WIFE RIPLEY MOZZIE THE ABLE SQUADRON THE BUTT OF ALL WE WILL KEEP FIGHTING TO COME BACK TO GOVERNMENT IF THE IMPEACHMENT REQUEST IS ACCEPTED WE WILL DO IS TO RESIST RESIST AND RESIST AND TRIED TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL COME OUT VICTORIOUS
CONNOLLY IN RECESSION AND THE GOVERNMENT IN THE GRIP OF A HUGE CORRUPTION SCANDAL THERE'S NATIONWIDE DISCONTENT AND THERE ARE REGULAR ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTEST
REASON ENOUGH FOR SENATORS LIKE ANNA AMALIA LEMMER US TO SUPPORT CALLS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S IMPEACHMENT AND HER IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE I BELIEVE THEY'VE ALL THINGS WILL BE A GOOD WORD FOR US WE ARE HAIR BUT I'VE NOW I NEED TO GO CRIES OF THE QUESTION
YOU NEED TO SOLVE THIS QUESTION AND DESCRIBES US AFTER SOLVE THE OTHER BROTHERS MAURITIUS SANTORO IS A RIO BASED POLITICAL SCIENTIST
WHO SAYS THE CHAOS AROUND THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS REFLECTS THE DYSFUNCTIONAL STATE OF BRAZILIAN POLITICS AND THE COUNTRY'S POOR ECONOMIC STANDING THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS CAN GO ON TO OCTOBER IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY SERIOUS CRIES HIS REFINED EMPLOYMENT
AND ABUSING THIS COMMUNITY'S VERY AFRAID SHOWING THE POLITICAL LEADERS OF THIS SCARRED IS ARE FAILING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO END THE DESCRIBES US A BIG BETS ON DECK ON ARMY WILL BE VERY BAD
AS THE SENATE DEBATE DRAGGED ON OUTSIDE CONGRESS SMALL CROWDS OF PRO AND ANTI GOVERNMENT PROTESTERS GATHERED ON EITHER SIDE OF A SECURITY FENCE THERE WAS SOME TENSION AS OVERZEALOUS MILITARY POLICE WADED IN
BUT GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS WERE LARGELY SUBDUED AND DOWN CAST AS THE INEVITABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUSPENSION BECAME APPARENT TO DO WE'VE GOT A LOT GOING ON THERE
WE ARE WATCHING NEED TO GOING NOW AS THE NIGHT WEARS ON AN EQUALLY SMALL BUT VOCAL GROUP OF
PRO IT BASEMENT PROTESTERS HAVE GATHERED THEY WANT RID OF THE LEFTIST WORKERS' PARTY GOVERNMENT BLAMING IT FOR MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S ILLS BUT THIS IS STILL A COUNTRY WITH DEEP ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
A HUGE CORRUPTION SCANDAL AND VERY VERY DEEP DIVISIONS IN SOCIETY GETTING RID OF A PRESIDENT HOWEVER LEGAL OR ILLEGAL THE PROCESS MAY HAVE BEEN WILL NOT SOLVE THIS COUNTRY'S MANY PROBLEMS
WHERE A DAVIES REPORTING FROM BRASILIA THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER IN A CAMBRIDGE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL BANNER DEAN AND FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHO WOULD DARE TO CONDEMN CORRUPTION ANYONE WHO DOES IS IN DANGER OF FINDING A FINGER POINTED BACK AT THEM TELLING THEM TO PUT THEIR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER FIRST THIS WEEK THE PRIME MINISTER LET SLIP SOME UNGUARDED REMARKS ABOUT NIGERIAN AFGHANISTAN BEING FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT
THE RESPONSE OF THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT PRESIDENT WHO CAME TO POWER LAST YEAR ON A PROMISE TO FIGHT CORRUPTION WAS THAT HE DID NOT WANT AN APOLOGY FROM MISTER CAMERON RATHER HE WANTED BRITAIN TO ACT SO THAT MONEY STOLEN BY CORRUPT NIGERIAN POLITICIANS AND THEN DEPOSITED IN BRITISH BANKS WOULD BE REPATRIATED TO THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN TAKEN
JOHN THE BAPTIST LIVING AUSTERELY OUT IN THE DESERT DRESSED IN ANIMAL SKINS AND EATING A CURIOUS DIET OF LOCUSTS AND HONEY WAS PROBABLY SAFE FROM ANY SUCH COME BACK WHEN HE ISSUED HIS OWN CONDEMNATION OF CORRUPTION
TOUCHED BY HIS FIERY PREACHING REPRESENTATIVES OF TWO IN THOSE DAYS NOTORIOUSLY UNSCRUPULOUS PROFESSIONS TAX COLLECTORS AND SOLDIERS CAME TO HIM TO ASK WHAT SHALL WE DO
AND HE GAVE THEM WHAT MAY SEEM TO US RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD AND UNEXCITING ADVICE COLLECTS NO MORE THAN THE AMOUNT PROSCRIBED HE TELLS THE TAX COLLECTORS AND TO THE SOLDIERS DO NOT EXTORT MONEY FROM ANYONE BY THREATS OR FALSE ACCUSATIONS
IF THE ADVICE SEEMS TO US UNEXCITING HE WAS PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY AS JOHN THE BAPTIST PLAINLY DID NOT WHICH RATHER TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT CORRUPTION IS WRONG EVEN IF WE DON'T ALWAYS LIVE UP TO OUR OWN PROCLAIMED STANDARDS
NEVER HAVING LIVED IN THE DEEPLY CORRUPT SOCIETIES SUCH AS THERE ARE AROUND THE WORLD WHERE TAX COLLECTORS AND SOLDIERS CAN MAKE RANDOM DEMANDS WE DON'T QUITE REALISE WHAT A TERRIBLE SCOURGE CORRUPTION WAS AND IS
BUT AS TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONALS MANIFESTO AHEAD OF TODAY'S ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON MAKES CLEAR CORRUPTION OFTEN LIES BEHIND THE SORT OF WOEFUL EVENTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH WHICH WE ARE ONLY TOO FAMILIAR A FIRE IN A GARMENT FACTORY WHICH KILLS DOZENS RECIPIENTS ARE PROGRAMMES OF MEDICAL TREATMENT SUFFERING DIRE SIDE EFFECTS CONTINUING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION NOT WITHSTANDING SEEMINGLY TOUGH REGULATIONS
AND AS THAT REPORT ALSO MAKES CLEAR EVEN IF CORRUPTION MAY NOT BE SO MANIFEST IN THE AFFLUENT WEST IT STILL OCCURS AND HARMS BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETIES AND IRONICALLY OF COURSE THE VERY COUNTRIES WHERE CORRUPTION IS LEAST OBVIOUS PROVIDE THE MOST DESIRABLE DESTINATIONS FOR THE ILL GOTTEN GAINS OF THE CORRUPTION WHICH OCCURS ELSEWHERE
CORRUPTION IS AN ISSUE FOR EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT STARTS FROM THAT PREMISE OF THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID THERE ARE NO SAINTS OCCUPYING HIGH AND HOLY GROUND STILL THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION COULD DO WITH A PATRON SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE NOT JUST FOR TRYING TO REFORM TAX COLLECTING AND SOLDIERING BUT ALSO FOR BRAVELY CHALLENGING THE BEHAVIOUR OF THOSE WITH GREAT
NOW AS THEN OPPOSING CORRUPTION REQUIRED SOMETHING OF THE CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS STRAIGHT TALKING AND ALSO THE SIMPLE CLOCK COURAGE WHICH WITH THE MARKS OF HIS MINISTRY
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND DOCTOR MICHAEL BANNER THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT NEVER WARNINGS WERE STARK MINISTERS IT WAS SAID WE ARE HELL BENT ON DESTROYING A GREAT PUBLIC INSTITUTION THE ONE I'M SPEAKING FROM OF COURSE THE B.B.C. ITSELF THE REACTION WAS EQUALLY ROBUST IT WAS CLAIMED HAD A LINE UP OF LOVELIES WE'RE DEFENDING AN ORGANISATION IS TOO BIG SPENDS TOO MUCH AND DAMAGES ITS COMPETITORS WELL TODAY WE SEE WHO WON SOME OF THE BEHIND THE SCENES TUSSLES
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES ITS PROPOSALS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE B.B.C. IN A WHITE PAPER HE ADVANCED BREATHING MAKES CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BACKED OFF CERTAIN IDEAS PUBLISHING THE PAY OF PRESENTERS OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE AND APPOINTING HALF OR MORE OF A NEW
POWERFUL B.B.C. BOARD BUT THERE WILL BE RADICAL CHANGES BOTH TO WHO RUNS THE ORGANISATION AND WHO SUPERVISES ITS FINANCES AND ITS COMMITMENT TO IMPARTIALITY AS DISCUSSED WITH LIZ HOW OLD HE WAS MANAGING EDITOR OF SKY AND DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMES AT G.M.T.V. AND ALSO WITH TESSA NOW BARONESS GEL A FORMER CULTURE SECRETARY MORNING TO YOU BOTH HELLO SHALL WE SHOULD ALL MORNING WITH THE BIG PICTURE LIZ HELL WHETHER SOMEBODY'S BACKED OFF OR NOT WHETHER THE ARGUMENTS TAKEN PLACE OR NOT
THESE WILL BE QUITE DRAMATIC CHANGES THE WAY B.B. SHE'S RUN A MANAGED SUPERVISED ABSOLUTELY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT WHITE PAPER AND IT IS VERY BIG AND I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEVER BECAUSE IT SET OFF HERS ABOUT SORT OF TUB THUMPING THINGS LIKE HOW MUCH PRESENTERS HAVE PAID AND SO ON COUNTER SCHEDULING AND ALL OF THAT AND THEN IT HASN'T HAD A DRESS THAT IS VERY OBVIOUSLY IN THE WHITE PAPER SO WE'VE REALLY HADLEY R. EYE OFF THE BALL OF WHAT IT'S REALLY LOOKING OUT WHICH IS WHICH IS VERY BIG IT'S THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE B. B. SEE HOW THAT CHANGES AND ALSO
THINGS WITHIN THE CHARTER WHICH UP WHICH ARE QUITE QUIET BUT THEY'RE LIKE DIVERSITY LIKE THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THE IMPARTIALITY BEING REINFORCED SO IT'S QUITE A DRAMATIC PIECE AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED FOR B.B.C. COMPETITORS MAY ADMIRE WHAT THE ORGANISATION DOES BUT FIND IT DEEPLY FRUSTRATING THAT THEY'RE DOING IT WITH PUBLIC MONEY AND BUT COMPETING PERHAPS UNFAIRLY WITH YOU AS THE GOVERNMENT DONE ENOUGH OR ACTUALLY WANT THEM TO PUT THE B.B.C. FERRY FIRMLY BACK IN IT
BUT I'M AN ACADEMIC NOW AND A PROFESSOR OF JOURNALISM SO I HOPE I'VE GOT SOME DEGREE OF OBJECTIVITY AND ALSO I DID WORK FOR THE B.B.C. FOR QUITE A LONG TIME TO I THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY QUITE A SENSIBLE CHARTER I THINK THEY WERE GOING TO BE A LOT OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THESE IN SEARCH OF HER COURSE WHO CAN'T GO FLAILING AROUND SAYING THAT THE B.B.C. IS GOING TO BE WRECKED BUT I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE DETAIL WILL FIND QUITE STRINGENT PROVISIONS IN THERE FOR HOW THE BEE BE SECRET INTO THE FUTURE BUT IT'S ALSO GIVEN SAFETY TESSA JOWELL ARE YOU REASSURED BY SOME OF THE CLIMB DOWNS BY YOUR SUCCESSOR AT THE CULTURE DEPARTMENT
NO I'M I'M NOT REASSURED AND I THINK THAT WE'VE ALL GOT TO FOCUS ON THE FINE DETAIL OF THIS WHITE PAPER WHICH IS GOING TO BE PUBLISHED AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO ANSWER THREE TESTS FIRST OF ALL WILL THE CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT'S WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE MISGUIDED WILL THE CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT'S GIVE PRECEDENCE TO ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE LICENCE FEE PAYER
OR WILL THIS BE A WAY OF INSERTING A GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT THROUGH THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OUT THIS UNIT SHE BORED THESE NON EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS THE SECOND IS THE LICENCE FEE SAFEGUARDED FROM FURTHER RAIDS BY GOVERNMENT WHO WANT TO FILL A GAP IN THEIR SPENDING PLANS THE LICENCE FEE AND THIS IS I THINK MY GOVERNMENT
THAT THAT THAT THAT I WAS PART OF IT I WAS CULTURE SECRETARY NEGOTIATING THE LAST CHART DIDN'T GET THIS EITHER THE LICENCE FEE INCOME MORE THAN THREE BILLION POUNDS IS NOT PUBLIC MONEY IN THE WAY THAT THE MONEY THAT FUNDS WORK AND PENSIONS OR ART SCHOOLS IS PUBLIC MONEY JUST GOING WOULD YOU
THIS IS THE PUBLIC'S MONEY THE THIRD OF COURSE IS WILL THE B.B.C. WRITTEN REMAIN TRUE TO ITS CORE MISSION THE WREATH IAN PRINCIPLES SO WIDELY SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO INFORM EDUCATE AND ENTERTAIN
THOSE ARE THE TESTS LET'S PITCH THIS WHITE PAPER HAS TO BE PEUT WENT GOT A NORMAL AMOUNT OF TIME LET'S SEE IF WE CAN WE CAN GET FOR EACH OF THOSE QUICKLY NOW CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE THE REAL WORRY PEOPLE HAVE LIZ HOWELL WHO ARE WORRIED IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS ENSURING THERE'S ONLY ONE BALL
IT CONTROLS THE B.B.C. THAT MEANS THESE EXTERNAL PEOPLE THEY APPOINT HAVE INFLUENCE OVER EDITORIAL DECISIONS AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO AND POINT MAYBE NOT HALF BUT STILL A VERY SIGNIFICANT FRACTION ON THAT BOARD IN ORDER TO GET THEIR WAY WHEN I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THERE AND I DO SYMPATHISE WITH WITH TESSA'S POSITION PERSIS PARTICULARLY SINCE SHE WAS INVOLVED IN SETTING UP THE B. B. C.
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT IS SOMETHING TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT OFCOM THE OFCOM BOARD MEMBERS ARE CHOSEN BY THE D.C. ARE NICE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR BOARD IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT ARE PROBABLY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE B.B.C. EXECUTIVES SO THE NON EXECUTIVES WHO WERE ON THAT BOARD BEING APPOINTED BY THE D.C. MUST DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM AND WE WILL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND IN FACT IN THE PAST AND MEMBERS OF THE B.B.C. TRUST WERE APPOINTED BY THE DE C.M.S. WEREN'T THEY SO IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT TESSA JOWELL NOT THAT DIFFERENT BUT
BUT WILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY BE EXPRESSLY AND EXPLICITLY TO THE LICENCE FEE PAYER RATHER THAN TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT'S THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE B.B.C. BEING MOVED TO IN EFFECT BEING A STATE FUNDED BROADCASTER
AS OPPOSED TO THE INDEPENDENT B.B.C. HOW WOULD WE KNOW COUNTRY LOVE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AS A YOU LOOKING FOR WORDING WITHIN THE NEW CHARTER OR THAN THE WHITE PAPER HOW WOULD WE KNOW WHERE THE RIGHT LES THAT'S IT PEOPLE ARE DANCING TO MINISTERIAL JUNIOR I THOUGHT HE'D BE BACK
I THINK YOU FIRST OF ALL LOOK AT THE TERMS BY WHICH THESE NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ARE APPOINTED AND THEN YOU EXAMINED THE BEHAVIOUR OF THIS NEW BOARD THE B.B.C. TRUST HAD AN EXPLICIT MISSION TO REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF THE LICENCE FEE PAYER NOW MOST PEOPLE LISTENING WILL CARE MOST ABOUT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY HIREN WATCH READ
WHAT CHANGES LIZ HOW DO YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE BECAUSE SOME WANTED THE B.B.C. TO BE MORE DISTINCTIVE WHICH WAS A CODE FOR BEING LESS POPULAR OFTEN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT AMONG PEOPLE TALK ABOUT B. SEEK AND ITS COMPETITORS AND EFFECT THE B.B.C. DOESN'T HAVE COMPETITORS BECAUSE IT'S FUNDED COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY AND IN A VERY PRIVILEGED WAY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE MONEY LIKE THE PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTERS SO I THINK SOME ELEMENT OF ENCOURAGING THE B.B.C. NOT TO COUNTER SCHEDULE IT IS IS THERE A BRIEFLY TESSA JOWELL IF YOU WOULD
WELL I THINK I THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT BUT THAT SHOULD STOP SHORT OF JOHN WAITING INTEL OF ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT MINISTER INTERVENING AND DIRECTING THE B.B.C. ON WHAT PROGRAMMES ARE SHOWN THERE
DON'T LET'S FORGET ALSO THE ECONOMIC POWER OF THE B.B.C. IN OUR COMMISSIONING PROGRAMMES IN HELPING THE INDEPENDENT PRODUCTION SECTOR TO GROW THE B.B.C. IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL MARKET INTERVENTION THE B.B.C. IS AN INTERVENTION IN THE BROADCASTING MARKET AT THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND IT BELONGS TO THEM NOT TO THE GOVERNMENT TESSA JOWELL LIZ HAL THANK YOU BOTH

JOIN ME DAVID EDMUNDS FOR CHEQUE MEET ME IN SAINT LOUIS THIS WEEK'S CROSSING CONTINENTS TODAY AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME AS FRIEND GARNI THE PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN RESPONSE TO DAVID CAMERON'S CLAIM THAT HIS COUNTRY IS FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT AND AFTER NEWCASTLE UNITED WERE RELEGATED LAST NIGHT FROM THE PREMIERSHIP WILL HEAR FROM THEIR RECORD GOAL SCORER ALAN SHEARER YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY THE TWELFTH OF MADE THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING FOREIGN COMPANIES HAD TO BE FORCED TO REVEAL WHO BENEFITS FROM THEIR OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES IN THE U.K. AS PART OF MEASURES TO TACKLE GLOBAL CORRUPTION THE REGULATION OF THE B. B. C. IS TO BE HANDED TO AN EXTERNAL ORGANISATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS NINETY YEAR HISTORY
DOWNING STREET HAS RULED OUT A REFERENDUM DEBATE BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND ANY OF HIS CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES WHO SUPPORT BRECK'S IT AND TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE WRITER AND AGONY AUNT SALLY BRAMPTON WHO'S DIED AFTER A LONG STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CORI CORFIELD
ALL FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT HOLDALL WANT TO BUY A PROPERTY IN THE U.K. WILL BE FORCED TO REVEAL WHO ULTIMATELY OWNED THEM IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO TACKLE GLOBAL CORRUPTION OR MONEY LAUNDERING THE MEASURE WHICH IS TOUGHER THAN SOME EXPECT IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL BEING ANNOUNCED BY DAVID CAMERON AT AN ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON MORE DETAILS FROM A DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT JAMES LANDALE
THERE ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROPERTIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES OWNED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES ALMOST HALF OF THEM IN LONDON THEY'RE WORTH MILLIONS OF POUNDS AND MANY ARE USED TO LAUNDER OR HIDE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN OBTAINED CORRUPTLY
SO TODAY DAVID CAMERA WILL SAY THAT ALL OFFSHORE FIRMS THAT ALREADY OWN PROPERTY HERE WILL HAVE TO REGISTER PUBLICLY WHO THEIR ULTIMATE OWNERS
ANY FOREIGN FIRM THAT WANTS TO BUY PROPERTY IN THE FUTURE ALL BID FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT WILL ALSO HAVE TO BE ON THIS REGISTER
SOME OF BRITAIN'S OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND DEPENDENCIES WILL ALSO JOIN THIRTY THREE OTHER COUNTRIES IN AGREEING TO SHARE AUTOMATICALLY THEIR OWN REGISTERS OF COMPANY OWNERSHIP INFORMATION THAT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE POLICE THERE'LL BE A NEW ANTI CORRUPTION COORDINATION CENTRE IN LONDON AND A WIDER CORPORATE OFFENCE FOR EXECUTIVES WHO FAILED TO PREVENT FRAUD OR MONEY LAUNDERING INSIDE THEIR COMPANIES
THE TEST FOR THE PRIME MINISTER'S INITIATIVE WILL BE HOW MANY OTHER COUNTRIES FOLLOW HIS LEAD FOR EXAMPLE THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS IS NOT ATTENDING THE SUMMIT AND IS NOT AGREED TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS COMPANIES
THE AFGHAN PRESIDENT ASHRAF GURNEY WHO IS ATTENDING THE SUMMIT IN LONDON HAS TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT THE ILLEGAL DRUG HABIT AT THE WEST IS THE MAIN DRIVER OF CORRUPTION IN HIS COUNTRY HE SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WAS DETERMINED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BUT IT NEEDED HELP DAVID CAMERON DESCRIBED AFGHANISTAN AND NIGERIA AS FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT AN UNGUARDED COMMENTS RECORDED ON CAMERA EARLIER THIS WEEK IN AN INTERVIEW TO BE BROADCAST AFTER THIS BULLISH AND PRESIDENT GANNY YOU SAID THERE WERE NO HARD FEELINGS ABOUT THIS REMARKS
HE WAS DESCRIBING THE LEGACY OF THE ST A LEGACY IN WHICH MANY ACTORS MANY FACTORS COMBINED TO PRODUCE ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT COUNTRIES ON HONOUR
THAT'S NOT THE DESIRED OFF HER PEOPLE AND I'VE BEEN ELECTED ON A MAN DID
TO MAKE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULER PLOD IMPERATIVE
THE CULTURE SECRETARY JOHN GETTING DOWN WILL TODAY ANNOUNCE A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF THE WAY THE B.B.C. IS RUN THE TRUST GOVERNING THE CORPORATION IS TO BE ABOLISHED DETAILS ABOUT THE SALARIES OF ITS BIGGEST STARS ARE TO BE MADE PUBLIC AND THE LICENCE FEE WILL CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER ELEVEN YEARS BUT SOME CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS THAT WOULD PLACE IT IN THE RUN UP TO THE WHITE PAPER APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SHELVED HIS OUR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT DAVID SILLETT
THE B.B.C. TRUST IS AT THE MOMENT OF THE FINAL ARBITER ON COMPLAINTS ABOUT IMPARTIALITY AND ACCURACY THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIA REGULATOR OFCOM WILL NOW TAKE THAT ON AND FOR DAY TODAY YOU SEE IS THERE'LL BE A NEW B.B.C. BOARD THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AT LEAST HALF ITS MEMBERS WILL BE APPOINTED BY THE B. B. C. WHICH MEANS THE REST MAYBE GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENTS IT'S LIKELY THEY'LL BE FURTHER DEBATE ON THAT TOPIC
THE B.B.C.'S CHARTER WILL RUN FOR ELEVEN YEARS TO AVOID RE NEGOTIATIONS COINCIDING WITH THE HEAT OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND WILL ALSO BE TOLD WHICH STARS EARN MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS HOWEVER IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THE SUGGESTIONS THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT INTO THE WHITE PAPER SUCH AS GIVING LICENCE FEE MONEY TO OTHER BROADCASTERS A MAJOR REDUCTION OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE CORPORATION AND TELLING THE B. B. C. WHEN IT WAS ALLOWED TO SCHEDULE IT'S MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMES
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT PEER LORD LEICESTER HAS THREATENED TO TABLE ACROSS PARTY BILL IN THE LORDS TO CHALLENGE WHAT HE SEES AS A THREAT TO THE B. B. C. HE SAYS MINISTER SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO APPOINT PEOPLE TO THE NEW B.B.C. BOARD WHAT GOOD REASON IS THERE BEFORE ALLOWING MINISTERS TO MAKE POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS TO A NEW STRONG UNITARY BALD
WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR B. B. C. CONTENT MY KEN ONE NOT HAVE THE COMMISSIONER FOR PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS USING A TRANSPARENT AND OPEN PROCESS THEY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRIME MINISTER MAKES THE APPOINTMENT
DOWNING STREET ARE BROUGHT DOWN DAVID CAMERON TAKING PART IN A TELEVISED TO E.U. REFERENDUM DEBATE WITH EITHER OF HIS CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO ANOTHER TEN SOURCE SAID THEY DID NOT WANT THE T.B. DEBATES TURNED INTO A BLUE ON BLUE FIGHT THEY WOULD LEAVE HAD EARLIER ACCUSED I. T. V. OF TAKING SIDES IN THE CAMPAIGN AFTER IT WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE PROGRAMME FEATURING THE PRIME MINISTER A ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH REPORTS
NUMBER TEN SAY THE PRIME MINISTER WON'T DEBATE AGAINST BORIS JOHNSON OR MICHAEL GO BECAUSE THAT YOUR REFERENDUM REFERENDUMS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN WHO'S UP AND WHO'S DOWN IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THEY ARGUE THAT A MAJOR NATIONAL DEBATE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN PURELY THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THEY'VE ALSO WARNED THE PRIME MINISTER MAY NOT APPEAR IN ANY OF THE T.V. DEBATES PLANNED BY THE B. B. C.
MEANWHILE AN EXPLOSIVE ROW HAS ERUPTED BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL LEAVE CAMPAIGN AND I T. V. OVER ITS DECISION TO INVITE THE UKIP LEADER NIGEL BARRAGE TO REPRESENT THE BRECHT'S AT CAMPAIGN THEY'VE NOW ACCUSED I.T.V. OF CAVING IN TO PRESSURE FROM NUMBER TEN AND WARNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS FUTURE
THEIR SPOKESMAN IS ROBERT OXLEY BY WEREN'T APOLOGISE FOR BEING CRITICAL OF I.T.V. FOR SAYING ONE THING IN PUBLIC AND THEN ROUND THE BACK ALLOWING NUMBER TEND TO CHOOSE THEIR OPPONENT IN THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THAT'S NOT HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS
V. HAVE REJECTED ACCUSATIONS OF BIAS THEY SAY NIGEL BARRAGE WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE HE'S CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE THE E.U. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS HOWEVER THE FEROCITY OF THE ROW UNDERLINES THE ALARM IN THE OFFICIAL LEAVE CAMPAIGN THAT MISTER THOROUGH RAJ WHO THEY BELIEVE IS POLITICALLY TOXIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE BRICKS AT CAMPAIGN
THE BRAZILIAN SENATORS HOLDING A MARATHON ALL NIGHT DEBATE AHEAD OF A VOTE ON WITH THE PRESIDENT GEOMETRY SET OF SHOULD BE IMPEACHED THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN SO FAR HAVE SAID SHE SHOULD BE PUT ON TRIAL ACCUSING HER OF MISMANAGING THE ECONOMY AND CONCEALING THEIR SIZE PERSIL'S BUDGET DEFICIT
THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP APPEARS TO HAVE ROWED BACK ON HIS PROPOSAL FOR A BAN ON MUSLIMS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES IN A SENSE THE IDEA WAS JUST A SUGGESTION BUT HADN'T BEEN CALLED FOR YET HE MADE THE COMMENTS JUST HOURS BEFORE HE WAS DUE TO MEET SENIOR REPUBLIC PARTY FIGURES MANY OF WHOM OPPOSE HIS NOMINATION

A NEW STUDY HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE ABORTION RATE IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAS DROPPED TO A RECORD LOW MAINLY DUE TO IMPROVED ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION ACCORDING TO RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN THE MEDICAL JOURNAL THE LANCET TWENTY SEVEN TERMINATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT BY ONE THOUSAND WOMEN EACH YEAR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES ARE MORE LIMITED RAPES HAVE REMAINED BROADLY STABLE
THE JOURNALIST OUR DAUGHTER SALLY BRAMPTON WHO IS CREDITED WITH CHANGING THE FACE OF WOMEN'S MAGAZINES HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SHEEP BATTLE DEPRESSION FOR MANY YEARS THE DETAILS OF HER THROWN CLEAR BUT IT'S THOUGHT SHE WALKED INTO THE SEA AT SAINT LEONARDS IN EAST SUSSEX KEITH DOYLE REPORTS

FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN QUICK TO PAY TRIBUTE TO ONE OF THEM SAID SUFFERERS OF MENTAL ILL HEALTH HAD LOST ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST ARTICULATE ADVOCATES
KEITH DOYLE REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S REFERRED TO BY DAVID CAMERON AS FANTASTICALLY CORRUPT IN THOSE COMMENTS CAUGHT ON A MICROPHONE WAS AFGHANISTAN AND TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE AFGHAN PRESIDENT ASHRAF GARNIE WILL BE ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER FOR A PANEL DISCUSSION AT THE ANTI CORRUPTION SUMMIT IN LONDON
WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN PRESIDENT GARNI VOWED TO FIGHT CORRUPTION BUT SINCE THEN HIS COUNTRY HAS SLIPPED DOWN TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONALS CORRUPTION INDEX IT IS THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM ONLY SOMALIA AND NORTH KOREA HAVE A WORSE SCORE I'VE JUST BEEN SPEAKING TO PRESIDENT GARNIE AND I ASKED FIRST WHAT HE THOUGHT WHEN HE HEARD WHAT DAVID CAMERON HAD SAID ABOUT HIS COUNTRY
WAS DESCRIBING THE LEGACY OF THE PETS A LEGACY AND WHICH MANY ACTORS MANY FACTORS COMBINED TO PRODUCE ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT COUNTRIES ON EARTH
THAT'S NOT THE DESIRED OFF PEOPLE AND I'VE BEEN ELECTED ON A MAN DID
TO MAKE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULER PLOD IMPERATIVE DOES THAT MEAN THERE ARE NO HARD FEELINGS OVER THOSE COMMENTS YOU'RE NOT SEEKING AN APOLOGY FROM HIM WELL NO BECAUSE
IT IS REFLECTED IT IT HAS
THE FIRST PART OF A DRESSING THE PROBLEM BEGINS WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
WE ARE PARTNERS IN A THIRD TOP ALTHOUGH
THIS CANCER WHAT DISTINGUISHES MY GOVERNMENT
IT'S OUTER CLARITY ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE INHERITED
OUR DETERMINATION TO ADD TO OUR WILLINGNESS TO FUND THEIR WAY NO SHIT SO THAT IT IN BEEN HAD TO BECAUSE ONE COMPONENT IS NATIONAL END THEN WE TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HANNAH COMPONENT IS GLOBAL IT'S THE DRAG A BIT OF THE WHIP
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF CORRUPTION IS THEN I'LL CUT IT CARTEL IN THAT NOW CUT IT QUITE TILL HE'S DRIVING TERRORISM EXTREMISM AND CORRUPTION IN THIS PART
WITHOUT DENYING THAT FLAN BRAWL REQUIRES THE REGIONAL IN THE GLOBAL PART SWEAT BUT IN YOUR EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN OFFICE AFGHANISTAN HAS SLIPPED DOWN TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONALS CORRUPTION INDEX WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS
WHEN THEN GETS THE WAY THEN DIX HAS CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE FORMS THAT I'M DELAYING DRIVE IT
ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE SHORT TO MEASURE ME
GRAN CORRUPTION ENGLAND WAS THE FIRST TO INVENT GRAND CAPTION IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IT TOOK DECADES TO OVERCOME IT WE DON'T WANT AS FOR THE KIDS BUT THIS IS A PROCESS SOPHIA
THERE IS FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF DONORS TO YOUR COUNTRY THE EUROPEAN UNION ENVOY TO AFGHANISTAN SAYING THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN YOUR COUNTRY IS IMPUNITY THE FEELING PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT AND NOTHING HAPPENS AND THAT IS A FEELING THAT YOU COULD COMBAT YOU YOU COULD BRING PEOPLE TO JUSTICE FOR CORRUPTION AND SEND OUT THE RIGHT MESSAGES
ABSOLUTELY BUT THE SAME EUROPEAN ENVOY I HOSTED AND THEY'RE A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AND I GIVE THE KEYNOTE SPEECH AND I ANNOUNCED
THE CREATION OF THE COUNTER CORRUPTION CENTRE DABBLING THEIR FORKS
WE HAVE A SPECIAL CRIMES TASK FORCE THAT U.K. GENEROUSLY SUPPORTED IN THE PAST BUT HAD BEEN MARGINALISED BECAUSE WHEN THEY STARTED WORKING AND IN THE PREVIOUS ERROR
ARRESTED SOMEBODY IN THE PALACE THEIR ENTIRE OPERATION WAS DISCONTINUE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ABNER SINK
AND NOW WE HAVE THE REFORMIST ATTORNEY GENERAL I REFORMIST SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
WE HAVE CHANGED OVER SIX HUNDRED JUDGES IN THIS PERIOD NOW WE'RE A CLIPPING TEMPTING A WHOLESALE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PROG SINKAGE ORAL CULTURE AND THEN THE PULLEY
BUT YOU HAVE TOUR EVER RULE OFF LOT APPROACH END NOT JUST BASIC ONION
OR ALLEGATION BECAUSE THEY'RE CUT UP IN GET IT IN THE MOST INTENSE
UP AGAIN THERE WHEN THEY ARE PROSECUTED AND CUTE I ASKED IN THAT MEETING THAT IN OMBUDSMAN ASKED
WE CREATED IN THAT ALL OF THE DONORS RE AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE THE CRITERIA IN ALL SHOULD BE THE PERSON SO THEY COULD INVESTIGATE ANY ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST THE PALACE AGAINST MYSELF AGUS THE CABINET WHAT MAKES YOUR COUNTRY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF THOSE WHICH ARE BATTLING WITH CORRUPTION IS THAT YOU WERE IN DESPERATE NEED OF FOREIGN FUNDS TO HELP REBUILD YOUR COUNTRY AND IF DONORS DON'T HAVE THE SECURITY THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE WELL SPENT THEN WHY ON EARTH SHOULD THEY PUT MONEY INTO AFGHANISTAN ABSOLUTELY THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION BETS WAY WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP
IN TERMS OF DONOR HAVE MONEY AGAIN LAST YEAR WHAT DID THEY DO WE INHERITED
GREAT DRESS SESSION BORDERING ON A DEPRESSION AND STILL INCREASED OUR DOMESTIC REVENUE BY TWENTY TWO PERCENT WE HAVE EVALUATED EVERY SINGLE DONOR FUNDED PROJECT BUT THE PROBLEM MY SIDE
DONORS ALSO IF ENORMOUS INEFFICIENCIES IN LACK OF CONTROL
THE KEY IS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE BUDGET SYSTEM WHERE EVERYTHING CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT IS THE POINT THAT YOU WILL FEEL READY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMING TO THE AFGHAN PEOPLE TO HOLD YOU TO ACCOUNT FOR PROGRESS ON CORRUPTION YOU'VE BEEN IN POWER FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND YOU SAY YOU NEED MORE TIME
THERE MUST BE A POINT AT WHICH I'VE NOW DO YOU HAVE TO IT'S KNOWLEDGE WHAT A START I'M NOT SAYING THAT I NEED MORE TIME IN THE SENSE
WE FACE THE RED QUEEN SYNDROME AND ALICE IN THE WONDERLAND RUNNING CONTINUOUSLY TO STAY IN PLACE IS NOT SUFFICIENT WE HAVE TO DOUBLE OUR POWER SPEED IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD
JUSTICE SECTOR THERE IS MORE FROM ONE OF IMPUNITY IT WHEN I SAY ACCOUNTABILITY THE CABINET PLUS THIS IS MOVING REVENUERS MOVING IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT A CHEAT'S THE BANKING SECTOR HAS BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL HOWEVER WET BEEPER POSED WITH THE DOG IS CLEAR OF CRITERIA IN CLEAR ACTION SAID THERE'S MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
BASED ON THAT I'M WILLING TO BE EVALUATED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE AND GET HER COULD I ASK YOU TO BE A CLEAR WHERE YOU STAND AT THE MOMENT ON THE TALIBAN AND TALKING TO THE TALIBAN WHEN WE SPOKE TO IN JANUARY THIS YEAR YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED A TALKS BASED APPROACH BUT THEY HAVE RECENTLY BEEN EXECUTIONS OF TALIBAN PRISONERS SO HAS YOUR POSITION CHANGED THEIR POSITION AS JUDGE NOT MY WEE
COMMITTED TO A FULL PURSE OF NEGOTIATION FOR COUNTRY AFGHANISTAN PAKISTAN STATES IN CHAIN AND READ ON A ROLL
KEMP IN PEACE DOGS INSTEAD OF BAD AS SERIOUS OF HINGE YES ATTACKS WERE LAUNCHED IN PARTICULAR IN THE ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS PEOPLE
EXECUTED HAD BEEN CONDEMNED FOR DUE PROCESS EVERY STEP OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS TO WHICH WE ARE TEARING THESE PEOPLE WERE KEPT CIVILIAN DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE NO LONGER OPEN TO TALKS WITH THAT I KNOW WE ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE PROCESS BUT WE NEED NOW CONDITIONS THEY'RE BIG RENOUNCED VIOLENCE BECAUSE THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE
IN THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HAS TO BE A DAY AND RECORD MASQUERADING AS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT A POLITICAL MOVEMENT USING DEBRETT CARTEL AS THE BASIS OF THEIR FINANCE IN THE HOLE WHERE IT NEEDS TO COME ALASTAIR'S IN A COMMON UNDERSTANDING
ARE THEY PROVIDING THE PLATFORM FOR OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF THAT OF ONE POLITICAL FABRIC
IF THE UNSAID AS THE LATTER OF COURSE INDIGENT BUT WHEN DAVE LAUNCHED IN ALL OUT WAR WE NEED TO RESPOND I HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE
ASHRAF GUNNY PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH HEAT
EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING DOWN THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT WE'LL FIND OUT HOW FAST WHEN THE BANK OF ENGLAND PUBLISHES ITS LATEST ECONOMIC REPORT TODAY WAS MORE WILL HEAR THE GOVERNORS' VIEW OF HOW BIG A ROLE IS BEING PLAYED BY THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE E.U. REFERENDUM OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMO AHMED IS HERE LET'S START WITH THE ECONOMICS NOT THE POLITICS HOW WORRYING IS IT
WELL NICK WE'VE HAD ALL THE SORT OF NOISE ABOUT THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE CLASHING CYMBALS SORT OF BLOWING TRUMPETS AROUND THAT BUT UNDERNEATH I THINK THERE IS THIS REAL SORT OF NOTE OF CAUTION AND THE LAST WEEK OF THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE SEEN SOME REALLY PRETTY WOEFUL NUMBERS ON THE U.K. ECONOMY MANUFACTURING OUTPUT IS DOWN
A WEEK ER SERVICES SECTOR THINGS LIKE RETAIL THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE U.K. ECONOMY EIGHTY PER CENT OF U.K. ECONOMY THAT IS SHOWN THE WEEK AS FIGURES SINCE FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WHEN WE WERE STILL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EUROPEAN UNION CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE CONSTRUCTION FIGURES ARE POUR SOME PEOPLE ARE JUDGING THAT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE IN APRIL FELTON TO NOUGHT POINT ONE PER CENT
THAT IS FLIRTING OBVIOUSLY WITH A NEGATIVE NUMBER AND THAT AWFUL WORD POLITICALLY SAY DANGEROUS RECESSION AND THAT I THINK IS WHERE WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME GUIDANCE TODAY FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND IF IT IS NOT YOUR RIPPLE COME TO EUROPE INSECT BUT IF IT IS NOT ONE OF THE OTHER EXTERNAL FACTORS STILL
PREDOMINANTLY THE CHINESE SLOW DOWN THERE IS THAT ALTHOUGH SOME CHINESE DATA HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY BETTER OVER THE LAST WEEK IF YOU REMEMBER BACK GEORGE OSBORNE SPOKE IN JANUARY ABOUT THE COCKTAIL OF DANGERS AROUND THE WORLD AND CERTAINLY CHINA SLOW DOWN HAS AFFECTED ALL MANY OF THE ASIAN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES ALSO IN AMERICA
AT THE BACK END OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AMERICA SEEM TO BE IN ROBUST GOOD HEALTH BUT CERTAINLY THE DATA THERE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT ABOUT HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION CONFIDENCE SHOWED SOME WEAKENING AND IN THE U.K. THERE HAS BEEN SOME EFFECT ON CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SOME NEW FIGURES THIS MORNING WILL SHOW THAT ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET FOR EXAMPLE
IS ED IS ACTUALLY FALLING OFF AND THERE ARE WHAT ARE CALLED INPUT COST SO THINGS LIKE THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE WHICH IS INCREASING OBVIOUSLY WAGES FOR MANY PEOPLE HAVE MEANT THAT BUSINESSES ARE ARE FINDING THEY ARE MORE COSTS AND THAT IS IN FOR AFFECTING THE WAY THEY ARE INVESTING THEN THERE IS THE REFERENDUM NOW THE GOVERNOR HE'S ALREADY SAID QUITE A LOT HASN'T HE ABOUT THE FACT THAT UNCERTAINTY IS DAMAGING AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM TO THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY WERE EXPECTING HIM TO GO FURTHER
THE FASCINATING THING TODAY WILL BE ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH DOES THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MARK CARNEY PUT ECONOMIC SLOWING GROWTH IN THE U.K. DOWN TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
WILL THAT BE IN EVEN MORE NEGATIVE AFFECT ON THE U.K. ECONOMY HE HAS MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE A POLITICAL POSITION THAT WOULD BE FAR TOO DANGEROUS THE THIRD RAIL ISSUE A LIVE RAIL ISSUE FOR HIM AS THE GOVERNOR S'POSED TO BE NEUTRAL HE DOES HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN POLITICS
BUT IT WOULD BE POLITICAL TO SUPPRESS HIS JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE EFFECTS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I EXPECT WE WILL HEAR SOME PRETTY STRONG WORDS TODAY FROM MARK ON IT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR REPORTS ON THAT LATER IN THE DAY COME ON AHMED THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST EIGHT GHOSTLIKE IMPRESSIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE WAY OF DESCRIBING THE EFFECT OF A SERIES OF NEW PRINCE BY SIR ANTONY GORMLEY BODY PRINCE ARE PART OF AN EXHIBITION OF HIS WORK THAT OPENS THIS WEEK AND HE'S IN A RADIO CAR NOW GOOD MORNING
GOOD MORNING MICHELLE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH YOUR USE OF THE HUMAN FORM IN SCULPTURE BUT GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW THESE PRINTS WERE MADE BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR BODY THAT WE SEE
YES THEM THE WORK IS CALLED ALL THE THE EXHIBITION IS CALLED CAST AND I GUESS I WANTED TO BE A KIND OF REGISTER OF LIVED MOMENT I THINK I WANT TO
ALLOW THESE WORKS TO BE IN SOME SENSES SOUNDING BOARDS FOR THE BODY OF THE VIEWER AND YEAH I DO I WANT TO SLOW THEM DOWN AND IN SOME SENSE ALLOW THEM TO RE ASSESS THEIR OWN BEING IN RELATION TO THESE TWO SETS
THE WOOD BLOCKS ARE BASED ON A SERIES OF SCULPTURES CALLED THE EXPANDED FIELD
AND THEY TRIED TO I GUESS YOU FOLD OUR KNOWLEDGE OF AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE ON THE SUBJECT
CONDITION OF LIVING WITHIN THE BODY AND THAT AND I GUESS THE WHOLE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SHOW IS ABOUT THE TRUTH THAT WE ALL LEAVE BEHIND APPEARANCE
THE PRINCE AS I UNDERSTAND IT INVOLVED YOU COATING YOUR BODY IN OIL AND PETROLEUM JELLY AND THEN FALLING OUT THERE RALPH
THAT'S RIGHT I JUST WANTED I DIDN'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY INTERFERENCE THIS IT'S CALLED CAST COS YOU YOU CAST A SHADOW AND THESE ARE THESE ARE INTO INDEXES NOT REPRESENTATIONS SO I ONCE MADE A WORK CALLED BLIND LIGHT WHICH WAS A CLOUD INSIDE A ROOM IN WHICH YOU DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY
YOU YOU WERE A CONSCIOUSNESS FREED FROM THE BODY BUT THEN AS YOU CAME TO THE OUTSIDE OF THAT GLASS BOX YOU BECAME AN APPEARANCE FOR OTHER PEOPLE
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FEEL THESE THESE BODY PRINCE BECOME I COUNTED MYSELF IN CRUDE OIL FROM NORTH DAKOTA AND PETROLEUM HIM JELLY AND THEN FELL ON THE PAPER ARE LEAVING THIS IMPRESSION
WHICH FOR ME IS ABOUT IN A SENSE THIS THIS MOMENT OF BEING THAT IS CAPTURED WHICH HOPEFULLY THEN CONFRONTS THE VIEWER WITH THEIR OWN BEING A MESSAGE IN THE IN THE OIL THEY DO USE OF THE OIL
WELL I THINK WE WE WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN WE ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON YEAH A PETRO CHEMICALS ON THIS OIL COMES FROM FROM
THE LATE CARDINAL CARBONIFEROUS IT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION YEARS OLD THAT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION YEARS OLD PHOTOSYNTHESIS OUI OUI OUI I THINK HAVE TO EVOLVE FROM THIS TIME BUT I WANTED TO REGISTER THIS MOMENT IN WHICH OUR
OUR SPECIES HOMO SAPIENS IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON OIL AND I FEEL
THIS IS A MOMENT THAT WE HAVE GOT TO SOMEHOW OVERCOME
SO IT'S IN A WAY A MEMORIAL TO THIS MOMENT WHEN WE ARE BOUND TO OIL SO MUCH OF YOUR YOUR PUBLIC ART YOUR SCULPTURE IS SEEN AND ENJOYED BY BY PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT PLACES
THE ANGEL OF THE NORTH RECENTLY HAD A CAMPAIGN MESSAGE SAVE B.H.S. PROJECTED UP AGAINST IT I WANT HOW YOU YOU FELT ABOUT THAT IT'S A CAMPAIGN MESSAGE BUT IT'S A BIT ABOUT A COMMERCIAL ENTITY DID YOU MIND YEAH WELL I I I I MIND VERY MUCH AND ALL USES OF THE ANGEL TO TO ADVERTISE OR PROMOTE CERTAIN INTERESTS
SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED DENY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE WORK WHICH IS THAT IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED FREELY BY ANYONE PASSING IT
SO I I HAVE RESISTED I'VE RESISTED I RESISTED GATESHEAD COUNCIL BEING ABLE TO TURN IT INTO A SYMBOL BY BY FLOODLIGHTING IT
I WANTED TO BE HERE AND AN OPEN WORK THAT IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH EAST AND I WANT IT I WANT IT TO BE IN A WAY INTERPRETED BY EACH PERSON INDIVIDUALLY SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT IT ISN'T USED FOR THIS SORT OF THING EVEN IF IT WAS A CAMPAIGN TO TRY AND SAVE PEOPLE'S JOBS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT NO SIR ANTONY ANTONY GORMLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS TWENTY SIX MINUTES PAST EIGHT ANTS MITCHELL BACK WITH THE SPORTS CHANCE THANKS NICK I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE NORTH EAST BECAUSE NEWCASTLE'S MANAGING DIRECTOR LEECH ARMY HAS APOLOGISED TO FANS FOR WHAT HE CALLS A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT AND UNDER ACHIEVEMENT FOLLOWING THEIR RELEGATION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE

THANK YOU I TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRIES ARE STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS AROUND THE WORLD BUT COULD UGANDA TUCKED AWAY IN EAST AFRICA OFFER A SOLUTION INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES ARE PRAISED IT FOR HAVING SOME OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE REFUGEE POLICIES THAT ARE WELCOMED BY MANY UGANDANS CATHERINE BARA HUNGER NOW REPORTS
SIX HOURS' DRIVE WEST OF UGANDA'S CAPITAL KAMPALA THE SCENE HERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE AROUND TO BE A ROLLING HILLS AND LUSH VEGETATION FED BY THE LAKES AND RIVERS THIS IS BACK YOU'RE BACK
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHOSEN TO PLACE IF THEY GUESSED AT THE REFUGEE CENTRE
WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
I FIND IT COULD DO YOU CHAO HAS SAN AND HER CHILDREN IN THEIR SMALLER BACK GARDEN SHE'S SHOWING THEM HOW TO PLANT AND WATER VEGETABLES EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GROW HERE BECAUSE THE SOIL IS SO FERTILE SIX YEARS AGO THEY FLED OR FIGHTING IN SOMALIA THEY PASSED THROUGH A NEIGHBOURING KENYA TO GET HERE AND HAVE SETTLED IN IF YOU AROUND A LITTLE
THERE IS NO PROBLEM IN UGANDA REFUGEES ARE GIVEN HOUSES FOOD AND FREE EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN YOU CAN EVEN SLEEP IN THE OPEN AND NO ONE WILL BOTHER YOU
AND IT'S NOT JUST COULD DE JA AND HAS FAMILY BENEFITING MOST REFUGEES WILL COME HERE RECEIVE MANY OF THE SAME RIGHTS AS UGANDANS PLUS UP LOTS OF
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SAY IS AN EXAMPLE FOR COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD CHARLIE AXE LEE IS SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED NATIONS REFUGEE AGENCY IN UGANDA THE MODEL IT'S ALMOST UNIQUE IN THE LOWER
AND FOR EXAMPLE IN KENYA WHERE WE HAD TO BE DONE
REFUGEES ARE RESTRICTED IN THOSE CAMPS THEM OR NOT
NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN UGANDA WHERE IT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY
HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND IT ALSO HELPS TO IMPROVE SOCIAL GET USING MY NAME IS MONK
THIRTY THREE HOURS
AND UM FROM BURUNDI I MET THIS YOUNG MAN IN THE SETTLEMENT HE WANTED THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT EVEN HERE LIFE AS A REFUGEE IS FAR FROM IDEAL
IN RURAL INDIA I HAVE A LACE I MISS MY FAMILY I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY FRIENDS ARE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO
WHY IS UGANDA SO WELCOMING TO REFUGEES MANY PEOPLE HERE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO FLEE WAR THE COUNTRY HAD A HISTORY OF INTERNAL CONFLICT EVEN THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TOP MINISTERS HAD BEEN IN EXILE SO THEIR POLICIES REFLECT THESE EXPERIENCES
BUT THERE ARE UGANDANS WHO ARE NOT HAPPY
AT THE EDGE OF MACHIAVELLI SAID TO MEND OUR VILLAGERS WITH NASH
PEOPLE HERE CLAIM THEY HAVE HAD THEIR LAND TAKEN AWAY TO MAKE WAY FOR THE REFUGEES THE GOVERNMENT ARGUES THE AREAS THAT HAD BEEN EARMARKED FOR THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM BUT STEVIN CUFF FUNGAL A FARMER HE'S ANGRY
AND THE LAND THEY HAVE ONE HUNDRED FOOT TO THIRTY IT DOES HAS NO EVIDENCE THERE HALF AN ACRE BECAUSE WHITAKER KNOW HE'D BUY I DON'T ANNOY THIS IS IF I DIE
SO CAN UGANDA'S GENEROSITY CONTINUES
IT HAS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST AND FASTEST GROWING POPULATIONS IN THE WORLD LONDON FOOD ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SCARCE
BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE ARE ADAMANT TO CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED THE BEST WAY THEY
ALL THIS WEEK CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE B.B.C.'S LANGUAGE SERVICES WILL BE REPORTING ON GLOBAL MIGRATION IN THE BUILD UP TO A DAY OF SPECIAL COVERAGE ON MONDAY FOR WORLD ON THE MOVE THE TODAY PROVOKE GRAHAM IS GOING TO COME ON MONDAY LIVE FROM VIETNAM AND LATER IN THE DAY RADIO FALL HAVE ALIVE ADDRESSED BY THE U.N. ENVOY AND CAMPAIGNER ANGELINA JOLIE PITT SHALL BE SPEAKING FROM THE RADIO THEATRE HERE AT BROADCASTING HOUSE
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THE GOVERNMENT'S PLANS TO REFORM PRISONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES DEPEND ON PRISONERS BEING RELEASED FIRST THOUSANDS OF THEM IN THE VIEW OF THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS LORD RAMSBOTTOM HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO OUR CORRESPONDENT
OR ROSS HAWKINS AND ROSS WE'VE HEARD THE JUSTICE SECRETARY TALK ABOUT PRISON REFORM BUT HOW COMMITTED IS THE GOVERNMENT TO THE IDEA BUT ABSOLUTELY WE EXPECT DETAIL NEXT WEEK IN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH THE BIG PLAN BEING A FOCUS ON REHABILITATION REFORM REDEMPTION MICHAEL GO SAYS BUT THE ISSUE IS THE PRISONS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THEIR OPERATING CAPACITY WE'VE GOT RISING NUMBERS OF ASSAULTS AND THE HARM
AND THE QUESTION IS CAN THESE PRISONS MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN REHABILITATION WHILE COPING WITH ALL OF THOSE PRECIOUS NOW AS YOU MENTIONED I ASKED THE FORMER CHIEF INSPECTOR OF PRISONS RAMSBOTTOM WHETHER HIS ADVICE WAS THAT PRISONERS NEEDED TO BE RELEASED IN SOME NUMBERS BEFORE MICHAEL GOES REFORMS WERE PUT IN PLACE
ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE PRISON SYSTEM IS CHOKED AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO ALL THE EDUCATION OR WORK TRAINING OR WHATEVER HE'S GOING TO INTRODUCE IN ORDER TO EDUCATE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE A USEFUL AND LAW ABIDING LIFE ON RELEASE AND HAVE SOME HOPE OF NOT FREE OFFENDING THE NUMBERS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL NOW HE TOLD ME AS MUCH AS THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PRISON POPULATION SOME TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE HE WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF THE REFORMS AS DO MANY OF THE TORY M.P.S I'VE SPOKEN TO BUT SOME OF THEM SOME OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WERE SUPPORTERS ARE ALSO PRETTY WORRIED ABOUT ACHIEVING THIS WITH THIS NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE FORMER JUSTICE SECRETARY KEN CLARKE TOLD ME THE REFORMS WERE NOT FOR THESE SUCCEED UNTIL YOU REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION AND THIS IS THE JUSTICE SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BOB NEIL
I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO START REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION STRAIGHT AWAY WE CAN DO THIS BY A SENSIBLE APPROACH TO RELEASE ON LICENCE
BY DEALING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE ISSUE OF INDETERMINATE SENTENCE IS WHERE PEOPLE NOW ARE PAST THEIR TARIFF AND COULD BE MUCH MORE SWIFTLY RELEASED IF WE CAN SPEED THE BUREAUCRACY
IS IT POLITICALLY POSSIBLE CREDIBLE TO THINK OF A CONSERVATIVE JUST A SEC SHE RELEASES HER RELEASING AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS FROM JAILS ABSOLUTELY NOT NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER BECAUSE THE POLITICAL REALITY HERE IS PLENTY OF CONCERTS IS PLENTY OF VOTERS FRANKLY WILL PRIORITISE THEIR VIEW OF ANOTHER FAMOUS CONSERVATIVE ON THE HOME AFFAIRS MICHAEL HOWARD WHO SIMPLY SAID THAT PRISON WORKS IT IS A WIDELY HELD VIEW THERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MASS
PRISONER RELEASES MICHAEL GOES POSITION IS HIS REFORMS WILL MEAN LESS REOFFENDING OVERTIME HE SAID CHANGE SHOULD BE MADE WITHIN THE CURRENT PRISON POPULATION BUT INTRIGUINGLY HE'S CONSULTING PRETTY BROADLY THE ACADEMIC SHAB MAROON AROUND A SEMINAR FOR HIM AT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE LAST YEAR AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN A PRIVATE CONFERENCE LAST MONTH A PRISON GOVERNOR OPENLY QUESTIONED WHETHER THESE REFORMS WERE POSSIBLE HE TOLD ME WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID ABOUT THE IDEAS FOR REFORM HE'D HURT AT THAT CONFERENCE
IT WAS MANY MANY MILES AWAY FROM WHAT HE'S SEEING ON THE GROUND ON A DAY TO DAY LEVEL WHERE HE'S STRUGGLING TO GET PRISONERS IN A BED HE'S STRUGGLING TO HAVE CLEAN CLOTHING FOR PEOPLE AND INSIDE AND THEREFORE HOW CAN HE DO ASSISTANTS HOW CAN HE BE THINKING ABOUT REHABILITATION WHEN THEY'RE STRUGGLING ON SUCH A DAY TO DO
THERE IS LOTS OF GOOD WILL FOR MICHAEL GO FOR ACADEMICS EM PEAS AND HIS IDEAS I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT REDUCING RE OFFENDING WITH THE PRISONS IN THIS STATE IS GOING TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BIG CHALLENGE RUSSELL THANK YOU NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE TURNER PRIZE IS OF COURSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIZES IN ART BUT IT IS USUALLY A CUE
FOR A SERIES OF GROANS THAT ART IS NOT LIE AREN'T REALLY USED TO BE IN THE PAST WILL GOT PERT HAS TO MAKE SENSE BUT ALL THE ARTS EDITOR WHEN ON THE DAY THEY ANNOUNCED THE SHORTLIST AT TATE MODERN WHOSE ORBIT FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD SO I DID IT TAKE BRITAIN I SHOULD SAY NICK I THINK IT'S INTERESTING SHORTLIST ONE MALE ARTIST THREE FEMALE ARTISTS RANGING AGES BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY NINE THREE SCULPTORS AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER MICHAEL DEANE SCULPTS WITH CONCRETE
USING LANGUAGE SHE'S INTEREST IN LANGUAGE AND WITTGENSTEIN ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF ANTHEA HAMILTON THIRTY SEVEN IS ANOTHER SCULPTOR WHO'S INTERESTED IN FETISH AND SURREALISM I SHOULD
GET PEOPLE GOING THERE'S ELLEN MARTIN WHO I THINK'S TERRIFIC THIRTY YEARS OLD HE'S A SCULPTOR WHO MAKES COLLAGES OUT OF EVERYDAY MATERIALS AND THEN FINALLY JOSEPHINE PRIDE WHO IS FORTY NINE MAKE STAGED PHOTOGRAPHS SORT OF MIMICKING THE VERNACULAR OF ADVERTISING AND FASHION AND ACTUALLY FRANKLY QUITE A GOOD LIST THEY'RE ALL ARTISTS YOU UNLIKE LAST YEAR SO THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT GOING FOR THEM AND THERE'S A NEW BOSS AT TATE BRITAIN IS KIND OF A NEW FEEL TO THIS ALL VERY QUITE ESTABLISHED AND I THINK IT WILL BE
AT A DECENT SHOWER ACTUALLY NO ELEPHANT DONE BUT THERE'S USUALLY AN EXCUSE FOR THE CRITICS TO SAY GOODNESS GRACE GET ME DO YOU THINK THERE IS THERE WHY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THE CONTROVERSY
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE ARTIST OR NECESSARILY THE ART THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE BUT MAYBE THAT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL WHO I THINK IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH THE CURATORS AT TATE WRITE ABOUT CONTEMPORARY ART I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE THE REASON FOR THIS PRIZE IS TO PROVOKE A DISCUSSION AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT CONTEMPORARY ART IN THE STATE OF IT TODAY THE REASON FOR TATERS TO DAUNT DEMOCRATISE ART TO MAKE A POPULAR AND YET THE RIGHT WAY THEY WRITE ABOUT THESE ARTISTS IS IN A PSEUDO INTELLECTUAL ACADEMIC LANGUAGE AND LORD KNOWS WHERE HE LEARNED TO SPEAK LIKE THIS MAKES IT IMPENETRABLE

THE WHITE PAPER PUBLISHED TODAY IS THE GOVERNMENT'S VISION FOR WHAT THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE NEXT B.B.C. CHARTER SHOULD INVOLVE THE CURRENT ROYAL CHARTER EXPIRES AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE S.N.P. M.P. JOHN NICHOLSON THE PARTY'S SPOKESPERSON ON CULTURE MEDIA AND SPORT AND HE SITS ON THAT COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING YOU OF YOUR PARTIES PUSHED FOR SOME TIME FOR SCOTTISH VIEWERS AND LISTENERS USERS OF THE B. B. C. TO BE BETTER SERVED WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT OUT OF THE NEXT TROTTER
WE WANT LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS FIRST OF ALL WELCOME HOPE WE HERE WILL BE IN THE WHITE PAPER WHICH IS A UNITARY BOARD I THINK THAT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT ON THE B. B. C. TRUST AND IN HAD A GENERAL COMMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE UP ABOUT AT WE ARE VERY KEEN THAT THE B. B. C. BOARD THAT REPLACES THE TRUST SHOULD BE MUCH MORE DIVERSE
NOT JUST OF COURSE INCLUDING THE NATIONAL MINORITIES WITHIN THE U.K. BUT ALSO BY BLACK MAJORITY REPRESENTATION WE HAD A DEBATE RECENTLY ABOUT THIS IN PARLIAMENT AND WE HEAR THERE MAY BE SOME MOVES TOWARDS THAT WHICH WE WELCOME IN SCOTLAND WERE VERY KEEN TO SEE BETTER REPRESENTATION INCLUDING A SEPARATE SCOTTISH SIX O'CLOCK NEWS WHICH I THINK VIEWERS WOULD WELCOME AND THAT IS BEING PILOTED A DIFFERENT FORMATS OF THAT IDEA ARE BEING PILOTED BY THE B.B.C. IN YOUR IDEAL WORLD
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE AN ENTIRELY BESPOKE HALF HOUR FOR VIEWS AND SCOTT I'D LIKE TO SEE A GROWN UP NEWS PROGRAMME YOU SITTING HERE COVERING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NEWS EVERY MORNING CAN YOU IMAGINE A PROGRAMME
THAT WILL NOT COVER ANY STORY OUTWITH ITS WATERS YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE ARMAGEDDON THE CASE AT THE SKULL AT THE SIX O'CLOCK IT'S IN SCOTLAND IT IS THAT OF REPORTING SCOTLAND THERE COULD BE ARMAGEDDON IN CARLISLE AND THEY WOULD LEAD ON ANY ASHORE IN CA LOOK IT'S LUDICROUSLY LUDICROUSLY PROVINCIAL BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE IS THE FIRST HALF HOUR OF THE SIX O'CLOCK NEWS AREN'T WE DID THE IDEA WHAT THAT
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE TRAINED AS A JOURNALIST SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE IN A PROGRAMME IS A DECISION'S MADE UNUSED VALUES OF THE LEAD STORIES A SCOTTISH STORY AND THAT IF IT'S A U.K. STORY YOU LEAD IN THAT IF IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL STORY YOU LEAD ON THAT AT THE MOMENT THE SCOTTISH NEWS PROGRAMME DOESN'T DO THAT IT ONLY COVER STORIES WITHIN SCOTLAND THAT IN THAT'S FOR A REGIONAL NEWS PROGRAMME BUT THAT'S NOT HOW HE'S GOTTEN SEES ITSELF AND IT SEEMS THAT SCOTTISH OPINION IS QUITE OUT OF STEP WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE WAS
A POLL PUBLISHED IN THE SCOTSMAN IN MARCHWOOD SAID THAT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF SCOTS TWENTY THREE PER CENT WANTED TO SEE A SPECIFICALLY SCOTTISH SIT YES BUT YOU DON'T YOU ASK PROGRAMME I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT WHAT THEY SAID TO THEM IN EFFECT WAS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE AN HOUR LONG VERSION OF THEIR CURRENT PROGRAMME
GOD KNOWS I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE AN HOUR LONG VERSION OF PROGRAMME I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD THROW THEMSELVES OFF A CLIFF RATHER THAN WATCH THAT WHAT THEY DIDN'T SEE WAS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HIS NEW TRANSFORMED SCOTTISH SIX SUCH AS THE ONE THING AT THE MOMENT HAD THEY SHOWN THE PILOTS
TWO PEOPLE ASKED IN THAT SYRUPY YOU COULD A VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION URGING TONY HALL TO DROP THE IDEA OF A SCOTTISH SEX THERE ARE NO FORTRESS IN SCOTLAND SO IT'S IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO FIND SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE TO SIGN A PETITION FOR ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WHAT YOU ARE CALLING FOR IS SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THAT SO THEY HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR IS WANTED BY BY A MAJORITY OF PAIRS OF THE LICENCE FEE AND SCOTLAND
THE B. B. C. ISN'T ALWAYS ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY PUBLIC OPINION OTHERWISE YOU'D HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT B. B. C. FROM THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT IN ANY CASE I DON'T ACCEPT YOUR YOUR BASIC PREMISE I THINK THAT SCOTS HAVE A THIRST FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT TWENTY HALLER SAID THIS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL HIMSELF HE SAID WE'VE GOT TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES THERE'S A SENSE THAT WITH LIGHT BEHIND CHANGING PUBLIC OPINION IN SCOTLAND PUT OUT A GOOD PROGRAMME PEOPLE WATCH JOHN NICHOLSON M.P.
