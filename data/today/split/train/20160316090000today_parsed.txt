FROZEN CHICKEN DEPEND ON THE TIMES OF THE YEAR THE CHRISTMAS LET'S SAY WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPUTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT COMING FROM SO THAT ALSO GETS BROUGHT FOR GOOD TIMES AS WELL
AND LAST NIGHT A SARAH CURRENTLY CHESS TOLD YOU MY DOPPELGANGER SSS SERGEANT BILKO WAS PONDERING THE IMPACT ON ORDINARY PEOPLE OF THEIR BUDGET NUMBERS THE CHANCER WILL HAVE TO UNVEIL OVER A GAME OF BINGO I'M CAB THE ISLAND
PEOPLE HAVEN'T GOT LONG POCKETS ANY WELSH AS I'VE GOT LONG TAKES ME I CAN'T REACH THE MONEY IS IN IT CHANCELLOR HE'S NOT GOING TO BE GIVING HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING NOW IS ON A BIG HAPPY DOES IT WORRY YOU AT ALL
AS WORRYING US BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT REALLY SO WHERE'S THE WORKING CLASS TO GET HIT WHATEVER HAPPENS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I THINK IT'S VERY UNFAIR I THINK THEY DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB TO BE HONEST AND IT WAS YOU SET THE LOT OF A LOT OF WOMEN I'M NOT
SARAH WOULD AGREE WITH THAT I'VE NO DOUBT IT IS THE BUDGET OF COURSE THAT'S ALL OVER THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING'S TEMP AT SIX LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THEM E. F. T. HEADLINE OSBORNE TO BREAK SECOND PROMISE IN BUDGET A FISCAL
CLAUSTROPHOBIA YOU'D ONLY GET THAT HEADLINE ON THAT PINK NEWSPAPER WOULDNAE IT'S POINTING OUT THE CHANCE WILL HAVE TO ADMIT TODAY THAT HE'S BROKEN TWO OUT OF HIS THREE FISCAL RULES LEE SET OFF AFTER LAST YEAR'S ELECTIONS LAST YEAR YOU MAY REMEMBER HE HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T MEET HIS OWN WELFARE CAP NOW HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADMIT THAT HE WON'T MEET HIS OWN DEBT TO RULE AND THE F.T. IS POINTING THAT OUT THE OTHER PAPERS TEND TO FOCUS ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CAME YESTERDAY
ABOUT THE FOCUS ON SCHOOLS SO THE TIMES HEADLINE SCHOOL DAYS EXTENDED IN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION POUND DRIVE FOR SUCCESS THE END A VICTORIAN CLASS TIMES IT SAYS AS ACADEMIES BOOM THIS IS THE IDEA OF A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION POUND EXTRA FUND FOR ADDITIONAL LESSONS AND ACTIVITIES AT SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND MISSUS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
WHICH COUNCILS WILL HAVE TO BID FOR THE GUARDIAN'S FOCUS IS MORE ON THAT PLAN VERY CONTROVERSIALLY DESCRIBED YESTERDAY THE PLAN TO TURN ALL SCHOOLS INTO ACADEMIES WHICH IT SAYS HE'S AT THE CENTRE OF THE BUDGET AND OF COURSE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT QUOTES THE TEACHING UNIONS ARE DEEPLY UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE AS CHANGES TO STRUCTURES THAT WON'T HELP STAB
THE DAILY MAIL'S HEADLINE IS HYPOCRISY OF COFFEE GIANTS BANDITS AND THE CRITICISM YESTERDAY OF COFFEE SHOP CHAINS WHO ARE BEING ACCUSED OF FUELLING A TIDAL WAVE OF LITTER IN WASTE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY PUT RECYCLING SYMBOLS ON THEIR TAKEAWAY CUPS WHEN ALMOST ALL OF THEM GO TO LANDFILL INSTEAD IT'S COMMENTS MADE BY CAMPAIGNERS NOT LEAST FRIENDS OF THE EARTH YESTERDAY THREATENED NINETY NINE OUT OF EVERY FOUR HUNDRED CUPS ARE DUMPED BECAUSE THEY'RE PLASTIC LINING MAKES THEM DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH MIKE CHARLES SAYS IT'S A DISGRACE AND HYPOCRITICAL OF COMPANIES TO IMPLY THERE CUPS CAN BE IN A RECYCLE WHEN THAT ISN'T THE CASE THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT BETTER ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE DAMAGE THAT LANDFILL DOES TO OUR ENVIRONMENT TO THIS IS THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND A QUICK WORD ABOUT THE FRONT OF THE INDEPENDENT
WHICH HAS THE HEADLINE RUSSIA SET TO DITCH ASAD BECAUSE THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT DIPLOMATS NOW ARE NOW CONVINCED THAT MOSCOW COULD BE READY
TO FORCE THE SYRIAN LEADER PRESIDENT OR SAD TO SPOT STEP ASIDE TO ALLOW A POLITICAL TRANSITION AS PART OF A DEAL TO END THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA AND THEY SUGGEST THIS IS ALL TIED IN WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE FIVE MONTH MILITARY MISSION IN SYRIA HAD FULFILLED ITS OBJECTIVE
IS THE END OF THE PAPERS IT'S NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX A MAN HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH STEALING A NUDE PHOTOS AND VIDEO AFTER HACKING INTO THE ACCOUNTS OF HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE REPEATABLE BOWS TOLD ME ABOUT THE CASE
THIS STARTED TWO YEARS AGO WITH AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LEAKING OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF NUMEROUS FEMALE CELEBRITIES IT WAS DUBBED HER THE TIME CELEB GATE STOLEN NUDE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ACTRESSES INCLUDING JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND CURSED DUNCE THEY WERE POSTED TO THE INTERNET WE LEARNT TODAY THIS MAN RYAN COLLINS THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD MAN FROM LANCASTER IN PENNSYLVANIA HE IS SAID TO HAVE BROKEN INTO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED
ACCOUNTS INTERNET ACCOUNTS BETWEEN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWELVE AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN AND ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTORS HERE IN LOS ANGELES HE USED A FISHING SCHEME TO ACCESS THESE ACCOUNTS THEY WERE RUN BY APPLE CLOUD AND G. EMAILS EFFECTIVELY EMAIL ACCOUNTS HE PRETENDED TO BE FROM THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HE'D TRICKED THE OWNERS OF THE ACCOUNTS INTO HANDING OVER THEIR USER NAME
AND PASSWORDS AND ONCE THEY'D DONE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS IN THE CLOUD THIS THE BACK UP MATERIAL WHICH IN SOME CASES INCLUDED THESE PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS DID HE THEN POST THEM ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE HE'S NOT ACCUSED OF THAT IS IT NO HE DIDN'T HE HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH THAT HE HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH UPLOADING THE IMAGES THE INVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T COVERED ANY EVIDENCE THAT LINKS HIM TO THE ACTUAL LEEKS OR THAT HE SHARED THE INFORMATION
BLOW THIS IN ANY WAY SO THAT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IN THIS STORY REMAINS A MYSTERY IN THERE IS STILL AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION HE HAS AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THIS WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO HER
HE HAS SIGNED A PLEA AGREEMENT AS YOU SAY HE IS PLEADING GUILTY TO A FELONY VIOLATION OF THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT THE PROSECUTORS HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT HE FACES A JAIL TERM OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD GET FIVE YEARS SO ESSENTIALLY IN DOING THIS DEAL HE IS HOPING FOR LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE PETER BOWS THANKS VERY MUCH
IT'S QUARTER PAST SIX NOW WE'RE EXPECTING AN AUSTERITY BUDGET SO WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU GO TO DISCUSS AUSTERITY BRITAIN THE CHELTENHAM RACES OF COURSE MATTHEW PRICE IS MAKING THE SACRIFICE HE'S THERE WITHOUT THE REST THE BUSINESS NEWS OH YES THANK YOU NICK ABSOLUTELY DOWN ON ITS LUCK CHELTENHAM AS THE SUN RISES HERE THEY'RE BRINGING IN MORE LOBSTER IN SALMON ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE ON ICE FOR TODAY'S CONSUMPTION
ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS IS GENERATED FOR THE GLOUCESTERSHIRE ECONOMY THE JOCKEY CLUB SAYS BECAUSE OF THIS FOUR DAY EVENT IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO TAKE THE PULSE OF THE BUSINESS WORLD IT'S PACKED WITH LEADERS MANY OF WHOM HELICOPTER IN
BUT THERE IS LITTLE TO REMIND YOU HEAR OF THAT STOCK MARKET WOBBLE THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS YEAR OVER CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA ABOUT COMMODITIES ABOUT U.S. RATE RISES PEOPLE DON'T SEEM UNDULY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
ONE MAN WHO IS SEEMINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT OF COURSE IS GEORGE OSBORNE HE HAS INSISTED THAT WHAT HE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE TODAY WILL BE TO A LARGE EXTENT DESIGNED WITH THAT WOBBLE IN MIND
MY MESSAGE IN THIS BUDGET IS THAT THE WORLD IS A MORE UNCERTAIN PLACE THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW SO WE DON'T PAY LATER
THAT'S WHY I NEED TO FIND ADDITIONAL SAVINGS EQUIVALENT OF FIFTY P. IN EVERY HUNDRED THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS BY THE END OF THE DECADE IS THIS HOWEVER ARE MORE UNCERTAIN WORLD OR IS THAT JUST AN EXCUSE SO THE CHANCELLOR CAN FOLLOW HIS IDEOLOGICAL HIS POLITICAL COURSE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN A MOMENT FIRST LET'S GIVE YOU AN IMPRESSION OF WHAT HAPPENS HERE
WAS THE SOUND OF THE FIRST RACE SETTING OFF AT THIS YEAR'S CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL CHEERED ON BY SIXTY THOUSAND SPECTATORS
LEADING OUT OF THE CORPORATE BOXES PACKED INTO THE GRANDSTANDS IT'S A SIGHT THAT ENERGISES THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOCKEY CLUB SIMON BASIL
WHO SAYS WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE HOSPITALITY TENTS CAN TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WAS A PIG FOR US IN HOSPITALITY TWO THOUSAND IN THAT NINE IT DROPPED CONSIDERABLY OR THEIR ATTENDANCES STAYED RELATIVELY STRONG AND THEY STAY VERY LOW FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS BUT REALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND TWELVE HAVE BEEN GROWING STRONGLY AND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS OUR LEVEL OF HOSPITALITY SALES AT CHELTENHAM WAS DOUBLED AND THIS YEAR HE'LL BE BE RECORD LEVEL AND A RECORD CROWD SO DESPITE THE CHANCELLOR TALKING ABOUT MORE AUSTERITY BRITAIN
I MEAN LOOK AROUND HERE YOU DON'T SEE IT DO YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK LOW INTEREST RATES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTRIBUTED TO PEOPLE'S OPTIMISM I THINK EVERYBODY'S NERVOUS ABOUT THE FUTURE MAYBE BUT I THINK THEIR CONFIDENCE ENOUGH AND THEY'VE HAVE ENOUGH CASH AND ARE GENERATING ENOUGH PROFITS THAT THEY CAN JUSTIFY THESE KIND OF EVENTS WHY THE OPTIMISM IS IT JUST A SENSE OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY BETTING ON MORE OPTIMISTIC FUTURE OR DO YOU THINK THEY ACTUALLY SEE SIGNS OFF
IMPRESSION I GUESS PEOPLE ARE SEEING SIGNS OF THAT WE CERTAINLY ARE WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE HABITS IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE ECONOMY PARTICULARLY HOSPITALITY AND THAT'S COME BACK AS I SAID VERY STRONGLY SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE AND CLEARLY THE WAY THE ECONOMY WORKS QUITE OFTEN IS IT'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY IF PEOPLE START SPENDING THAT IN ITSELF GETS THE ECONOMY MOVING CRATES EMPLOYMENT AND ALL THE REST OF IT IN THAT THAT THEN KEEPS THE WHOLE THING MOVING INTO WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT IN THE RACE
OPTIMISM HOWEVER WILL NOT GET US THROUGH IF GEORGE OSBORNE IS RIGHT ABOUT THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC HEADWINDS SO IS HE RIGHT THAT WAS A QUESTION BETWEEN RACES FOR SIMON FRENCH A FORMER GOVERNMENT ECONOMIST AT THE CABINET OFFICE NOW CHIEF ECONOMIST AT GORDON AND COKE
I THINK HE'S RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED THAT SIXTEEN WEEKS ON FROM THE AUTUMN STATEMENT THAT ACTUALLY THE PROSPECTS FOR GLOBAL GROWTH HAVE DETERIORATED FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY WE'VE HAD A VERY ROCKY RUN IN FINANCIAL MARKETS WHICH
SOMEWHAT OF AN INDICATOR OF BROADER GROWTH CONCERNS BUT IN CHINA BUT ALSO ACROSS THE BROADER WE SAW THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK LAST WEEK I REALLY STRONG STIMULUS PACKAGE SHOULD TRY AND GET GROWTH BACK THERE AND THAT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT WON'T AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE U.K.
SO HE'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT HE'S HAVING TO MAKE THOSE CUTS AS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS RATHER THAN ANY MISCALCULATION ON HIS
WELL I WOULDN'T SAY SO MUCH IT'S RIGHT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THE DIVIDES THE ECONOMICS PROFESSION IS WHETHER THESE CUTS ARE INDEED NECESSARY RIGHT NOW AND OF COURSE
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT GOING INTO A SLOWDOWN GLOBALLY IS THE GOVERNMENT TAKES THE FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR ON SPENDING CUTS TO TRY AND PROVIDE DOMESTIC STIMULUS I THINK THE PROBLEM IS AN IDEOLOGICAL ONE BOTH WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO WITHIN THE TREASURY WHO DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EFFICACY OF THE STIMULUS OF FISCAL POLICY
FOR HIM HE HAS TO MAKE A VERY CAREFUL BARONESS BETWEEN SUBBING OUT GROWTH BY BEING STRONGER ON SPENDING CUTS VERSE IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO MARKETS THAT ACTUALLY IS NOT WAVERING FROM THE PUFFER CREDIBILITY YOU STAKED ABSENCE CREDITOR LET'S BRING IN OUR MARKETS GETS NOW MIKE AMY FROM PIMP COAT GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING ARE THE CUTS WE EXPECT TODAY NECESSARY
I THINK ADDITIONAL CUTS ARE NOT NECESSARY PERSONALLY I THINK THE THE CHALLENGE YOU'VE GOT IS THAT THE DEFICIT NOW IS JUST UNDER FOUR PERCENT OF G.D.P. THE IDEOLOGICAL DEBATE WAS WAS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN THE DEPTHS IT WAS TEN PERCENT OF G.D.P. AND THERE WERE ISSUES OF GOVERNMENT CREDIBILITY I THINK NOW THE DEATHS IT WHERE IT IS I DON'T THINK WE REALLY AT THE POINT AT WHICH WE NEED TO SEE FURTHER CUTS IF THE IF THE ECONOMY SLOWING AND FURTHER CUTS DAMAGING OR OR NOT SUCH A WORRY
WELL I I CAN'T SEE HOW IT COULD BE GOOD IF YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT A SLOWING ECONOMY AND AND THE DEFICIT IS NOT
OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF HAVE A REASONABLE NUMBER THEN THEN I THINK YOU COULD ARGUE BE SELF DEFEATING I THINK I THINK CERTAINLY IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING I WOULD ALMOST LIKE A. SAY THAT DOES LEAD US ON TO THE QUESTION OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S CREDIBILITY AT THE MOMENT IS HE GOING TO HIT THE TARGETS HE SET HIMSELF WHAT ABOUT THE POLICIES HE'S PURSUING I KEPT SIMON FRENCH AWAY FROM THE RACES FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER
HERE'S OBJECTIVE INITIAL OBJECTIVE TO CUT THE DEFICIT COMPLETELY IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT IS NOW GIVEN HIMSELF TO PARLIAMENTS TO DO SO
I THINK THE MORE INTERESTING PART OF THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE VERY RIGID FISCAL TARGETS ARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY OF GOVERNING A MACRO ECONOMY THE U.K. IS A
OPEN MERCANTILE ECONOMY THAT IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL HEADWINDS THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL AND THEREFORE BY HAVING STRINGENT STRONG FISCAL RULES ON THE ONE HAND YES THAT PROVIDES A VERY CLEAR SIGNAL TO AGENTS IN THE MARKET BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S
THESE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE POTENTIALLY JUST SIXTEEN WEEKS LATER FROM A PREVIOUS FISCAL ROUND WE HAVE A VERY VERY DIFFERENT SET OF PUBLIC SPENDING FORECAST WHICH YOU HAVE TO COME UP AND I THINK THE WATCHWORD HERE FOR THEIR BUDGET IT HAS TO BE FLEXIBLE TO FACTORS THERE BEYOND THE CHANCELLORS
WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE FLESH ON THE BONES OF THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MACDONALD'S POLICY THINKING NOW IS HE SEEMING A LITTLE BIT MORE REASONABLE WERE TAKEN IN ISOLATION THE FISCAL TARGET HE HAS PROPOSED THE FISCAL RULE IS MUCH MORE FIT FOR PURPOSE FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY
THAN THE CURRENT FISCAL CHARTS LAID OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT IT HAS THAT WATCHWORD I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FLEXIBILITY IT ALSO HAS THE PROTECTIONS OF CAPITAL SPENDING THAT I THINK IS EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT DURING THIS PARLIAMENT SO
IT IS A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE SET OF RULES ON WHICH YOU GOVERN PUBLIC SPENDING
THERE YOU GO THAT SHADOW CHANCELLOR MORE CREDIBLE ON THE FISCAL RULE AT LEAST MIKE AMY THERE WE GO I THINK WITH A CHECK THE CHALLENGE YOU'VE GOT THAT OF COURSE IS THE FISCAL RULES JOHN MADONNA SETTING OUT A ARE BROADLY SIMILAR TO THE ONES OF THE PREVIOUS LABOUR ADMINISTRATION HAD WHICH WAS TO SEPARATE OUT CURRENT SPENDING IN AN INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING INVESTMENT SPENDING AND THE CHALLENGES IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS TO SEPARATE OUT THE TWO SO I THINK WHAT WOULD BE A CLEANER WAY TO DO IT WILL BE TOO
REALLY SET OUT INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING OUT OF JUST A SEPARATE ENTITY HAVE A NATIONAL BANK OR SOMETHING ON THOSE LINES HAVE A GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED AND AND FORMALLY SEPARATE THE TWO THEN YOU COULD KEEP TO A SET OF RULES WITHOUT WITHOUT THE SMOKE AND MIRRORS WHICH IS SOMEWHAT INEVITABLE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU MIX THE PUBLIC FAMOUS I'M GOING TO ASK YOU MIKE TO RANK THESE THREE EVENTS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE THE BUDGET THE CHELTENHAM GOLD CUP AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE MEETING ALL THIS WEEK
O.K. WELL THE THE FED IS IS CLEARLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE FOR I THINK REALLY IT FOR U.K. MARKETS OH KAY I JUST HAVE A HOPING WELL TELL US WHAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR ON THE FED OR EXPECTING AT LEAST SO WE THINK THE FED WILL WILL BE LESS DOWNBEAT ON THE ECONOMY THAT WAS LAST TIME WE DON'T THINK THEY'LL CHANGE INTEREST RATES
THEY WILL TRY AND INDICATE THAT THEY'RE STILL IN THE GAME OF RAISING INTEREST RATES AND TRY KEEP JUNE OPENERS AS A POSSIBLE DATE OH KAY AND THEN YOU WERE GONNA MENTION THE BUDGET NUMBER TWO I THINK JUST QUICKLY SO THE BUDGET IS IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS INDIVIDUALS MORE THAN THAN THE BROAD ECONOMY I THINK WE KNOW BROADLY SPEAKING WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO
AND THE CHELTENHAM GOLD CUP IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR A FURTHER SUBSET OF THE ECONOMY WHO'S HER THINK HAD TO BE LIKE I HAVE TO BE THERE INDEED I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE NOT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US ON THE PROGRAMME FROM LONDON THIS MORNING SOMEONE WHO IS HERE IS TOP MIGHT FAIL FROM HARGREAVES LANDS DOWN HE'S COME UP FROM BRISTOL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT MORNING
AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL MIKE WAS MENTIONING THERE WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET NEW HELP TO SAVE IS THAT GONNA MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS A SCHEME DESIGNED TO HELP LOWER WEALTH HOUSEHOLDS TO BUILD UP SOME FINANCIAL RESILIENCE TO BUILD UP A CASH RESERVE AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD AMBITION IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THE CHALLENGE WITH IT OF COURSE IS THAT A LOT OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS DON'T HAVE ANY SPARE CASH TO SAVE
HOW CAN THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SCHEME AND IT'S GOING TO COST GEORGE OSBORNE MONEY ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS TAKING HIM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION PENSIONS SPIC CHANGES WE KNOW WILL NOT HAPPEN BUT COULD THERE BE TWEAKS I THINK I'LL BE SURPRISED IF WE GET THROUGH TODAY WITHOUT SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PENSIONS HE CAN JUST ALLOWANCES YOU CAN ADJUST THE ANNUAL ALLOWANCE YOU CAN PAY INTO A PENSION EVERY YEAR IF HE REDUCES WE GET TO SAVE LESS IN A TAX EXEMPT POT STORING UP PROBLEMS FOR US AT LEAST AND SOCIETY IN THE FUTURE ABSOLUTELY SO IT ERODES OUR ABILITY TO MAKE
RESERVE FINANCIAL RESERVES FOR OUR RETIREMENT COULD HE TWEET NATIONAL INSURANCE DO YOU THINK HE COULD ATTACK THE NATIONAL INSURANCE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT EMPLOYERS PAINTER PENSION POT HAS A LOT OF MONEY GOING IN THERE
THEY APPEAR IN THE REGION ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS A YEAR HE GIVES AWAY A SUBSTANTIAL CONCESSION THERE TO EMPLOYERS THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY NATIONAL INSURANCE ON HIS CONTRIBUTION SO SMALL TWEAK THERE COULD RATE AND A COUPLE OF BILLION POUNDS QUITE EASILY AND WOMEN THEIR STATE PENSION AGE THERE'S BEEN THIS PROBLEM WITH WOMEN WHO'VE SEEN A STATE PENSION AGE WAS RISING RAPIDLY SOME OF THEM FEEL
CAUGHT OUT BY THAT HE COULD ANNOUNCE SOME FLEXIBILITY AROUND STATE PENSION IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO COST THEM ANY MONEY BUT IT COULD IT COULD APPEAR THAT VERY ANGRY GROUP OF PEOPLE TEN SECONDS ON INCOME TAX AND EXCISE DUTY I DON'T SEE ANY PRESSURE ON HIM TO RAISE THOSE THRESHOLD RIGHT NOW IT'S AN AMBITION OF HIS HE WANTS TO RACE PERSONAL ALLOWANCES
THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE YEAR TO DO IT AND THE LAST ONE VERY BRIEFLY JUST THIS ISSUE ARE WE HAVING MIKE HIT UPON IT A BIT ARE WE HAVING TOO MANY BUDGETS IS IZZY TWEAKING TOO MUCH IS IT GETTING COMPLICATED FOR INSTANCE IN THE AREA OF YOUR EXPERTISE PENSIONS AND UNDOUBTEDLY
ASSISTANT POLITICAL INTERFERENCE CONSTANT RULE CHANGING UNDERMINES INVESTORS CONFIDENCE IT UNDERMINES THEIR WILLINGNESS TO COMMIT SAVINGS FOR THE LONG TERM SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW YES ABSOLUTELY I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT TOM MIGHT FAIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK YOU'RE OFF TO WALK THE DOG RATHER THAN TO JOIN IN THE HORSE RACING SO ENJOY YOUR WALK WITH THE DOG WE WILL BE BACK IN AN HOUR FROM CHELTENHAM ON WHETHER GEORGE OSBORNE IS STILL PERCEIVED AS BEING BUSINESS FRIENDLY

THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHRIS IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW THERE ARE SOME BUDGETS THE CHANCELLOR'S SIMPLY CAN'T WAIT TO DELIVER FULL OF APPEALING PROMISES AND BOLD REFORMS THERE ARE OTHERS THAT THEY MUST WISH COULD BE CANCELLED AS THE NEWS THEY CONTAIN IS PRETTY BAD AND THE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE PRETTY LIMITED SO IS THIS ONE OF THOSE DAYS THE MAN WHO CAN TELL US IS NORMAN SMITH OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR I WOULD HAVE GEORGE OSBORNE WANTS TO STAY IN BED THIS MORNING NORMAN I THINK IT PROBABLY WILL TO THE LATTER OPTION
AND IN THAT SENSE WILL BE A RATHER UNUSUAL BUDGET BECAUSE USUALLY BUDGETS AT THE START OF A PARLIAMENT TEND TO BE THE OCCASION WHEN A CHANCELLOR AND INFLICT MOST PAIN BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO THAT SORT OF THING NEARER AN ELECTION THEY USUALLY BUDGETS WHERE GOVERNMENT SEEK TO MAKE A BIG POLITICAL STATEMENT OR CHANGE THE ECONOMIC DIRECTION YOU DON'T GET ANY SENSE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE BUDGETS IN PART OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MONEY AROUND IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SELF IMPOSED STRAIT JACKET THE CHANCE WAS PUT IN
BUT PUT ON HIMSELF IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT BUT ABOVE ALL I THINK BECAUSE OF THIS HUGE GREAT BLACK THUNDEROUS CLOUD OVERHANGING THE BUDGET IN THE FORM OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM WHICH HAS TOTALLY RECAST THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND I THINK THE DEFINING MISSION OF THE CHANCER AND THIS BUDGET WILL BE TO AVOID ANTAGONISING ALIENATING IN A RAGING
TORY BACKBENCHERS BY DOING ANYTHING WHICH IS GOING TO GET THEIR BACKS UP WHICH IS WHY I THINK HE HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED HE'S GOING TO PUT ON HOLD HIS PLANS FOR A RADICAL PENSION REFORM I SUSPECT IS WHY THE PRE BRIEFING FOR THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN SORT OF MORE MODEST END OF THE SPECTRUM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ON A LONGER SCHOOL DAY AND SCHOOL ACADEMIES SOMETHING IT ALMOST EXPECT MORE IN A QUEEN SPEECH AND IT'S WHY I SUSPECT THE CHANCELLOR HAS BEEN HUMMING AND HIRING OR APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN HUMMING AND HIRING OVER WHETHER TO PUT FUEL DUTY
STRIKING THOUGH THAT HE WANTS TO SHOW CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT HE CAN DO THAT HE IS STILL AMBITIOUS AND YOU MENTION THEY SCHOOL REFORMS WITH THAT SLOGAN PUTTING THE DEBT NEXT GENERATION FIRST YEAH I THINK THAT WILL BE SORT OF THE KEY MESSAGE BUT
THE PRIME MINISTER FLOATED THIS BACK IN HIS CONFERENCE SPEECH SO THE IDEA WAS ALL READY OUT THERE IT'S NOT A FUNDAMENTALLY NEW THOUGHT AND DEED YOU KNOW LET'S BE HONEST TONY BLAIR FIRST CANVASSED THE IDEA WHEN HE WAS PRIME MINISTER AND I MEAN I THINK THAT SORT OF SUGGESTS THAT HE IS LOOKING FOR AND NARRATIVE FOR
FOR THIS BUDGET AND THAT'S ONE HE CAN GRASP THAT AND NO DOUBT IT'LL BE PUT ALONGSIDE THE PROPOSALS FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING TO PREPARE US FOR THE FUTURE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IN BROAD TERMS IT MAY ACTUALLY BE QUITE A MEEK BUDGET WE KNOW HE'S GOT TO TRIM A FEW BILLION IT'S NOT A MASSIVE AMOUNT I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S GOT TO MAKE SOME ARE PAINFUL DECISIONS AND THAT MAY WELL COME IN THE FORM OF FURTHER SPENDING CUTS THAT HARDY PERENNIAL
STEALTH TAXES THERE MAYBE SOME ASSET SALES HAVE BEEN SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT AND NETWORK RAIL BUT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE ON THE PLUS SIDE I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PAIN INFLICTED UPON US AND THEY MAY EVEN BE A FEW SORT OF GOODIES IN TERMS OF RAISING TAX THRESHOLDS TO EASE SOME OF THAT PAIN
NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN UNTIL RECENTLY MARCO RUBIO WAS BEING TOUTED AS THE MAN TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP AS REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT A FEW HOURS AGO HE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE AFTER BEING BEATEN BY TRUMP IN HIS OWN HOME STATE OF FLORIDA
WHILE IT IS NOT GOD'S PLAN THAT I BE PRESIDENT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR MAYBE EVER IN A WHILE TODAY MY CAMPAIGN ARE SUSPENDED
THE FACT THAT I'VE EVEN COME THIS FAR IS EVIDENCE OF HOW SPECIAL AMERICAN
AND ALL THE REASON MORE WHY WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS NATION REMAINS A SPECIAL PLACE I ASK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE FEAR DO NOT GIVE INTO THEIR FRUSTRATION
I ASKED OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SO PAUL IF THAT LEFT DONALD TRUMP WITH A CLEAR RUN WELL IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'D SAY THIS WAS THE MOST SPECTACULAR VICTORY FOR DONALD TRUMP HE WON IN FLORIDA MARCO RUBIO'S HOME STATE CAUSING THE THE COLLAPSE OF THE RUBIO CAMPAIGN WHO WAS ONCE CONSIDERED A FAVOURITE HE'S WON ELSEWHERE HE IS WAY OUT IN FRONT AND YET TONIGHT IT WAS THE DEFEAT IN OHIO BY JOHN CASEY THAT HAS PROBABLY GAINED MOST ATTENTION
AND PEOPLE THINKING IT'S NOT YET IN THE BAG FOR DONALD TRUMP AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY LOW KEY PERFORMANCE FROM DOUBLE TRUMPET HIS VICTORY PARTY WHICH I WAS OUT THIS EVENING THE MOST LOW KEY I'VE HEARD HIM AND I THINK HE RECOGNISES THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE QUICKLY SEWN UP AS I THINK HE HAD ORIGINALLY HOPED AND THERE'S A LONG WAY STILL TO GO FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE TO DONALD
THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT YOU GET TO THE CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND IN JULY THAT HE IS SHORT OF A MAJORITY AND SOME SORT OF DEAL IT'S STITCHED TOGETHER WHICH ELIMINATES DONALD TRUMP AND THE PICTURE IN THE REMAINING RACES HE HAS TO WIN SIXTY PER CENT OF THE DELEGATES THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS THAT'S QUITE A TALL ORDER AND THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT WHO LOATHE DONALD TRUMP
ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY WHETHER THERE IS A PATHWAY NOW TO STOP HIM IT SEEMED UNTHINKABLE THAT THEY COULD STOP HIM A FEW WEEKS AGO I THINK THEY'RE NOW THINKING WELL MAYBE WE CAN
I THINK I LET ME JUST ADD AS A RIDER TO THAT IF DOUBLE TRUMP GOES IN WITH WAY MORE DELICATE FOLKS THAN ANYBODY ELSE HAVING ONE MORE STATES THAN ANYBODY ELSE IF THERE IS A STITCH UP THAT TRIES TO STOP DONALD TRUMP I THINK THERE COULD BE VERY VERY UGLY SCENES IN CLEVELAND IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE AT REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT TRIES TO DO BUT THEY MIGHT BUT IT WAS STITCHED UP INVOLVES PROMOTING ANOTHER MAN AND WHO WOULD THAT BE
AND THAT IS THE COMPLICATING FEATURE THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS HOPED IT WOULD BE MARCO RUBIO BUT AS WE'VE HEARD HE'S OUT OF THE RACE NOW SO YOU'VE GOT JOHN CASEY WHO IS A MORE CONSENSUAL CANDIDATE BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STATE THAT HE'S WON LAST NIGHT HIS OWN STATE OF OHIO AND THEN YOUR OTHER OPTION IS SENATOR TED CRUISE
WHO IS IDEOLOGICALLY VERY PURE CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VERY MUCH ON THE RIGHT AND AGAIN NOT TO THE TASTE OF THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT SO THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT IS DESPERATE TO STOP DONALD TRUMP IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE A HORSE THAT IT THINKS IT CAN WIN EVERYTHING THEY'RE MUCH CLEARER FOR THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THEIR LATEST VOTES
I THINK IT IS I THINK HILLARY CLINTON HAS WON QUITE DECISIVELY LAST NIGHT I THINK THAT THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR HER TO WIN THE NOMINATION AND IT'S VERY HARD NOW TO SEE BERNIE SANDRA'S WHO HAS HAD A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CAMPAIGN TAKING IT MUCH FURTHER HE MIGHT WANT TO CARRY ON BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL GIVE ME A VOICE AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN THE MORE THE MORE DELEGATES HE GAINS TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF HIM THINKING
DO I HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION I THINK THAT MOMENT HAS PASSED JOHN OPAL THANKS VERY MUCH
THE TIME'S NOW TWENTY MINUTES TO SEVEN BELGIAN POLICE SAY ONE SUSPECT IS DEAD AND TWO OTHERS ARE ON THE RUN AFTER A COUNTER TERRORISM MADE IN BRUSSELS THAT'S LINKED TO THE PARIS ATTACKS LAST YEAR FOUR POLICE OFFICERS WERE ALSO WOUNDED DAMIEN COME ATTICUS IS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT AND HE'S IN BRUSSELS AND DAVID WHAT ARE THE POLICE THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT THIS OPERATION AND WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE
GOOD MORNING YES WELL WHAT POLICE RESPECTING IS AN UPDATE IN A LITTLE WHILE AND A COUPLE OF HOURS HERE FROM THE MAGISTRATES THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATES WHO OVERSEEING THE WHOLE OPERATION AT THE MINUTE THEY WON'T CONFIRM OR THEY WON'T SAY WHAT THE IDENTITY IS OF THE MAN WHO WAS KILLED IN THAT POLICE OPERATION YESTERDAY THEY SIMPLY HAVE SAID THAT IT IS NOT
THE ONE OF THE TWO PRIME SUSPECTS THEY'VE BEEN HUNTING SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS THOSE ARE ABD ISLAM AND MOHAMMED ARE BREENIE TWO MEN PHOTOGRAPH TOGETHER DRIVING TO PARIS BEFORE THE ATTACKS BELIEVED TO HAVE PERHAPS OFFERED SUPPORT ALL TAKEN PART IN SOME WAY IN THOSE ATTACKS AND THEN FLED BACK TO BRUSSELS
IT IS NOT ONE OF THEM BUT THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN IDENTITY FOR THAT LAST NIGHT POSSIBLY THAT WILL COME TODAY IN THE MEANTIME THE POLICE OPERATION NOW HAS WOUND DOWN IN THAT AREA BUT WE KNOW OVERNIGHT THERE WAS STILL MORE POLICE RAIDS GOING ON AROUND BRUSSELS INDEED AND THE TWO MEN ON THE RUN DO WE KNOW WHICH WAY THEY WERE HEADED WHERE THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE
NO THIS IS SORT OF SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AT THE MINUTE THERE WAS SOME REPORTS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE PERSON POSSIBLY TWO MORE IN THE APARTMENT THE POLICE WENT TO VISIT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS YESTERDAY WAS POLICE FRENCH AND BELGIAN POLICE CAR FOLLOWING UP ANY LINES OF ENQUIRY SINCE THE PARIS ATTACKS PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING WE UNDERSTAND LEEDS FOR THOSE AROUND THE PARIS ATTACKERS SO THEY'RE ELEVEN PEOPLE ALREADY ARRESTED IN BRUSSELS
THIS WAS FOLLOWING ASSOCIATES OF ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE SO WHEN POLICE WENT TO THIS APARTMENT KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THEY WERE FIRED AT FROM INSIDE WITH AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON AND THEY MAY HAVE GLIMPSED ONE POSSIBLY TWO OR MORE PEOPLE INSIDE SO IT'S I THINK POLICE AT THIS STAGE ARE UNCLEAR WHETHER ANYONE DID ESCAPE AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO SAW A HUGE OPERATION LAST NIGHT AROUND THAT AREA COMBING IT SEARCHING FOR MORE PEOPLE
DAMIEN GRAMMATICAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS SEVERAL SET OUT WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTING FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET THE TELEGRAPH LEADS ON GEORGE OSBORNE'S PLANS TO EXTEND THE SCHOOL DAY FOR SOME PUPILS IN WHAT IT CALLS AN END TO THE VICTORIAN TRADITION OF THE THREE THIRTY BELL IT REPORTS THE MOVERS A DRIVE TO IMPROVE STANDARDS THAT OFFERS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES LIKE SPORT AND ART
THE TIMES POINTS OUT THE CRITICS WILL SAY THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS OF EXTRA FUNDING OVER THIS PARLIAMENT SIMPLY WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR EVERY SCHOOL AND SAYS THEY COULD BE OTHER CHALLENGES LIKE TRANSPORT IN RURAL AREAS THE GUARDIAN SUGGEST THE CHANCELLOR SEEKING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PRESSING AHEAD WITH REFORMS DESPITE THE DISRUPTION OF JUNE'S EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM
AWAY FROM THE BUDGET MANY PAPERS HAVE DRAMATIC PICTURES FROM THAT SHOOT OUT INVOLVING SECURITY FORCES IN BELGIUM THE STAR'S HEADLINE IS ROOFTOP TERROR WHILE THE SUN CALLS AT THE BATTLE OF BRUSSELS THEY SHARE POLICE MARKSMEN ON A ROOF WITH A SCARF AROUND HIS FACE FOR OFFICERS WERE WOUNDED AND A SUSPECT SHOT DEAD THE EXPRESS IS AMONG THOSE REPORTING A LINK TO THE PARIS ATTACKS IN NOVEMBER AND SAYS AT LEAST TWO SUSPECTS ARE STILL BEING HUNTED
MIRROR SUGGESTS ONE OF THOSE YOU'VE GOT AWAY WAS THE PRIME SUSPECT A UP TO SALAAM BUT OTHER PAPERS SAY HE WASN'T THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE INDEPENDENT REPORTS THAT RUSSIA IS SET TO DITCH IT SUPPORT FOR THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BUT SURE AL ASAD THE PAPER SAYS WESTERN DIPLOMATS BELIEVE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS WILLING TO JETTISON ASSYRIAN DICTATOR TO END THEIR FIVE YEAR CONFLICT AS LONG AS RUSSIA CAN REMAIN A KEY PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE
IT FOLLOWS THE UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT EARLIER THIS WEEK THE RUSSIA WITH WITHDRAWING ITS FORCES FROM SYRIA THE PAPER QUOTED UNNAMED DIPLOMATS ARE SAYING THE RUSSIANS NO BUT ASAD IS A DESTABILISING FORCE AND IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A PEACEFUL TRANSITION HE AIN'T STAYING
THE DAILY MIRROR SAYS ROLF HARRIS IS FACING NEW CHARGES RELATING TO SEVEN ALLEGED VICTIMS ONE OF WHOM IS DISABLED THE PAPER SAYS ONE OF THE CLAIMS AS THAT HE MOLESTED A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL AT B.B.C. TELEVISION CENTRE IN LONDON IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE FIRST TIME HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF AN ASSAULT ON B.B.C. PREMISES THE PAPER SAYS THE EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD WHO SERVING A FIVE AND A HALF YEAR SENTENCE FOR CHILD SEX OFFENCES OFFENCES WILL APPEAR IN COURT AGAIN
HALF OF ALL CHILDREN ARE NOW RESISTANT TO SOME OF THE MOST COMMON ANTIBIOTICS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH IT EXAMINES RESEARCH FROM BRISTOL UNIVERSITY AND IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON WHICH STUDIED RESISTANCE TO INFECTIONS CAUSED BY THE E. COLI BACTERIA
THE PAPER SAYS THE STUDY'S RAISED FEARS THAT TREATMENT COULD BE RENDERED INEFFECTIVE A NUMBER OF THE PAPERS INCLUDING THE SUN HIGHLIGHT BAD BEHAVIOUR AT THE CHELTENHAM RACING FESTIVAL IT'S FRONT PAGE SHOWS FOOTBALLERS FROM M.K. DONS AND INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT A CUP OF URINE WAS THROWN FROM THEIR EXECUTIVE BOX AT THE FESTIVAL THE MALE REPORTS THAT JUST YARDS AWAY A REALITY STAR IN A MODEL WERE SEEN FLASHING THEIR BREASTS AT RACEGOERS IT'S HEADLINE SO MUCH FOR THE SPORT OF
MATTHEW PRICES ARE THERE WORRYING ISN'T IT IT'S A QUARTER TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING GEORGE OSBORNE IS PREPARING TO ANNOUNCE HIS BUDGET HE SAID LITTLE INCLUDE BOLD DECISIONS AND BIG INVESTMENTS TO HELP THE NEXT GENERATION
WHAT DOES PRESIDENT PUTIN SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE MAIN PART OF RUSSIA'S FORCES ARE LEAVING SYRIA REALLY MEAN M.P.S TRIED TO FIND OUT YESTERDAY WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY APPEARED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN CURRAN
ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS AGO WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID HE COULDN'T PREDICT WHAT RUSSIA WOULD DO BECAUSE IT WAS A RIDDLE WRAPPED IN A MYSTERY INSIDE AN ENIGMA LISTENING TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND YESTERDAY IT DIDN'T SOUND AS THOUGH MUCH HAD CHANGED
UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF US KNOWS WHAT THE INTENT OF MY IN HIS WHEN HE CARRIES OUT ANY ACTION AND ACCORDING TO A CONSERVATIVE FORMER FOREIGN OFFICE MINISTER LORD HOWE THERE'S EVEN A WORD FOR IT
THE PRINCIPLE OF MASK A ROVER THAT IS SAYING ONE THING AND DOING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT HE'S VERY WELL ESTELLE
PRESIDENT PUTIN TOOK THE WORLD BY SURPRISE WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THAT RUSSIAN FORCES WOULD START TO LEAVE SYRIA AFTER ALMOST SIX MONTHS OF MILITARY INTERVENTION PHILIP HAMMOND SAID RUSSIA SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN ANY CREDIT FOR STOPPING WHAT HE SAID WAS AN ILLEGAL BOMBING CAMPAIGN SOMEBODY
GOES IN TO ANOTHER COUNTRY STARTS BOMBING CIVILIAN POPULATIONS DESTROYING OUR HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IF AND IT'S STILL A BIG IF THEY DO DECIDE FIVE MONTHS LATER THAT THEY'VE DONE ENOUGH LET'S NOT GIVE THEM TOO MUCH PRAISE IT'S A BIT LIKE DID HE STOP BEATING HIS WIFE
MISTER HAMMOND WAS IN THE COMMONS TO ANSWER AN URGENT QUESTION TABLED BY LABOUR'S SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY HILARY BENN WHO GAVE A CAUTIOUS WELCOME TO THE RUSSIAN ANNOUNCEMENT
BUT I AGREE WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY THAT IT NEEDS TO BE CARRIED THROUGH IN PARTICULAR IF IT IS GOING TO SUPPORT THE CEASEFIRE AND DE ESCALATE
AND HE ACCEPTED THAT PHILIP HAMMOND DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE TIMETABLE FOR ANY RUSSIAN WITHDRAWAL COULD HE HAVE EVER COMMENT ON THE STATEMENT TO REPORTED ATTRIBUTED TO A RUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTER TODAY WHO SAID THAT RUSSIAN FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO ATTACK SO CALLED TERRORISTS A TERM THAT THEY HAVE USED IN THE PAST TO COVER AIR STRIKES ON THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID THAT STATEMENT WASN'T AS HE PUT IT TERRIBLY REASSURING THE S. N. PEAS FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN ALEX SALMOND POINTED OUT THAT THE CURRENT CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA WAS THE ONLY ONE WE HAD IS THAT NOT THE MOST CREDIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE RUSSIAN DON'T
IS THIS GOING TO PRESSURISE THE ASIDE REGIME INTO TAKING WERE FLEXIBLE ATTITUDE IN THE PIECE STOPS AND IF THAT IS THE CASE IT SHOULDN'T INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CAVEATS FIRST AND THEN THE WELCOME WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY FUN SET TO HAD THE WELCOME AND THEN THE CAVEATS PHILIP HAMMOND REPLIED THAT WE ALL START OUT WITH HOPE AND END UP WITH EXPERIENCE AND A LABOUR FORMER CABINET MINISTER BEN BRADSHAW SAID THE FARM SECRETARY WAS RIGHT TO BE CAUTIOUS
BUT IF THIS DOES TURN OUT TO BE POSITIVE WITH THAT NOT VINDICATE THE RIPOSTE APPROACH THAT BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE TAKEN TOWARDS PRESIDENT PUTIN AND INDICATE THE DECISION TAKEN BY THIS HOUSE TO EXTEND THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL R.A.F. MISSION IN IRAQ TO SYRIA
MISTER HAMMOND SAID HE WAS CONVINCED THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN ONLY RECOGNISE STRENGTHS AND ADDED THAT HE DIDN'T THINK THE RUSSIAN LEADER DID SHADES OF GREY
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SUGGESTED THE ANNOUNCEMENT COULD BE A WAY OF REMINDING BEA ASSAD'S REGIME THAT IT OPERATED AT RUSSIA'S WILL APPOINT PICKED UP BY THE CONSERVATIVE CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CRISPIN BLUNT
DOES THE FOREIGN SECRETARY
INSOFAR AS HE REFERRED US TO RUSSIA SENDING A MESSAGE TO US THAT THIS
IT'S POTENTIALLY HELPFUL AS FAR AS THE PEACE PROCESS IS CONCERNED BY TRYING AT ASS ACTORS NOT OVERPLAYED HIS HAND WHEN WE IN THE PEACE TALKS
MISTER HAMMOND SAID IT COULD BE A MESSAGE TO THE ASAD REGIME OR IT COULD BE A MESSAGE TO THE OPPOSITION BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY KNEW OVER IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS THE FORMER LIBERAL DEMOCRAT LEADER MING NOW LORD CAMPBELL SUGGESTED MY PUTIN HAD ACHIEVED ALL OF HIS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES HE MANAGED TO BUTTRESS THE OUTSIDE TO SEE HIM AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT
AS HAS ALREADY BE POINTED OUT HE'S RETAINED THE MILITARY BASE IN THE TACKIER AND THE PORT OF TARSUS AND THERE CAN BE NO SETTLEMENT OF THE SYRIAN QUESTION WITHOUT THE ENDORSEMENT
IT MAY NOT BE GAME SET AND MATCH TO MISS A PROTEIN BUT IT'S MOST CERTAINLY GAME AND SAY
THE DEFENCE MINISTER LORD HOWE SAID HE AGREED WITH A LOT OF THAT BUT TOLD LORD CAMPBELL IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN IF THE RUSSIAN WITHDRAWAL LEFT THE SYRIAN REGIME STRONGER OR WEAKER
SEAN CURRAN REPORTING AND ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT YOU CAN HEAR MORE AS USUAL HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO IT'S NOW TEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WE'RE TOLD THAT THE BUDGET TODAY WILL
PUT THE NEXT GENERATION FIRST THAT'S THE PHRASE BEING USED ABOUT WHAT TO THE CHANCELLOR WILL SAY TODAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN WELL LONGER SCHOOL DAYS AND AT THE END TO LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES RUNNING SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY WILL ALL BE REQUIRED TO BECOME ACADEMIES
WITHIN THE NEXT SIX YEARS ROBERT PIGGOTT IS OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT LET'S KICK OFF WITH THIS A LONGER SCHOOL DAY I MEAN WE'VE HAD THERE'S THE BELL GOING AT ROUGHLY THREE THIRTY FOR NEARLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS HAVEN'T WE WELL YES AND NO I DON'T THINK ALWAYS ALWAYS
BACK TO THE VICTORIAN DAY SARAH I THINK THEN IT WAS NINE TILL FOUR OR FIVE GENERALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A LONGER LUNCH BREAKS THE CHILDREN COULD GO HOME BUT YES IT'S BEEN THREE THIRTY TRADITIONALLY FOR A LONG WHILE HASN'T IT AND IT WILL FOR SOME SCHOOLS BE EXTENDED AT LEAST BY AN HOUR AND THERE'S BEEN A CHORUS OF PEOPLE FROM UNIONS AND TEACHING STAFF SAYING WELL ACTUALLY WE ALWAYS PUT ON
ACTIVITIES AFTER SCHOOL ANYWAY BUT THIS WILL BE MONEY THAT SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND COULD BEAUTIFUL IT WOULD LET THE ACCENT COS THIS BY AN HOUR EVERY DAY THERE'D BE ENOUGH MONEY FOR A QUARTER OF THEM TO DO SO AND THE CHANCELLOR VISAGE IS THAT THAT EXTRA WOULD BE FILLED WITH LESSONS OR HIGH QUALITY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SPORT OR ART RIGHT BUT JUST A QUARTER OF SCHOOLS AFFECTED BY THIS
YES AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE TARGETED READING BETWEEN THE LINES WHAT HE'LL SAY TODAY HE'S SAYING THAT HE WANTS TO REVERSE THE TREND OF THE POOREST CHILDREN ATTENDING THE WEAKER SCHOOLS AND I THINK THAT IT'S LIKELY THAT THAT THOSE ARE WEAKER SCHOOLS WOULD DO WELL IN THIS COMPETITION FOR THE MONEY THERE IS ALSO AN ASPIRATION TO IMPROVE BRITAIN'S UNACCEPTABLY LOWS STANDING IN THE GLOBAL LEAGUE TABLES FOR EDUCATION ACCORDING TO WHAT THE CHANCE IS GOING TO SAY TODAY SO THOSE TWO AIMS SEEM TO BE
THE PRINCIPAL ONES WE'RE ALSO TOLD THAT ALL SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO BE ACADEMY IS NOW AN AWFUL LOT OF SECONDARIES ARE NOW ACADEMIES BUT RELATIVELY FEW PRIMARIES AND THIS APPLIES TO THEM TOO YES IT DOES AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SO KEEN TO CONVERT THEY'RE STILL ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED SECONDARIES TO CONVERT BUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL THAT ONLY ONE IN SEVEN PRIMARIES HAVE CONVERTED SO THAT LEAVES FOURTEEN THOUSAND ODD STILL UNDER LOCAL AUTHORITY CONTROL THIS IS
QUITE A HISTORICAL CHANGE ASCENT OF A SYSTEM A COUNCIL RUN SCHOOLS PUT IN PLACE IN NINETEEN OH TWO BUT A LONG HELD CONSERVATIVE AMBITION AND IT WILL BE QUITE A BIG CHANGE PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAVE A KNOCK ON EFFECT ON THINGS LIKE THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM AND NATIONAL PAY SCALES FOR TEACHERS BECAUSE ACADEMIES ARE FREE FROM BEING BOUND BY EITHER OF THOSE THINGS SO GRITTY QUITE A BOLD CHANGE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SEEN IT COMING FOR SOME TIME IT'S SEAT'S BEEN SIGNALLED MANY TIMES BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOR EXAMPLE RATHER PIGGOTT THANKS VERY MUCH
IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN WHEN THE CHANCELLOR STANDS UP TO MAKE HIS BUDGET STATEMENT TODAY HE'S UNLIKELY TO REMIND US OF A GOALIE SET JUST A FEW YEARS BACK IT'S A GOAL WITH A REAL MEANING HERE AT THE LONDON GATEWAY THE NEW SUPER PORT PLAN BEFORE THE SLOWDOWN IN THE WORLD ECONOMY AND WHICH IS STILL OPERATING OR JUST A THIRD OF WHAT HE HOPES WILL BE ITS FINAL CAPACITY
BRITAIN GEORGE OSBORNE TOLD US BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE SHOULD DOUBLE ITS EXPORTS TO A TRILLION POUNDS A YEAR BY THE END OF THE DECADE LAST YEAR THAT FIGURE WAS JUST OVER HALF THAT
AND WE'RE ON COURSE TO MISSUS TARGET BY AT LEAST A THIRD SO WHY LESLEY BACHELORS HERE TO TELL US DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF EXPORT IN A WAY THIS PLACE WHERE WE ARE SITTING HERE
ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM OF HAVING A GRAND AMBITION FOR TRADE IN THE REALITY OF THE CHILL WINDS COMING UP THE THAMES
YES CHILL WINDS INDEED CERTAINLY THE THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS JUST FLATTENED IS JUST COMPLETELY FLAT AND IT'S ALL VERY WELL WANTING TO EXPORT OUT OF THE RECESSION BUT SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IT'S GOT TO BE BUYING YOUR PRODUCT AND SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE IMPORTED
ALL THE COUNTRIES HAD THE SAME IDEA SO WE NEED TO BE BETTER AND SHARP ABOUT WHAT WE DO SO WHEN THE CHANCE I WAS TALKING RECENTLY ABOUT THIS COCKTAIL OF RISKS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DESCRIBE TODAY IN HIS BUDGET THE CHILL WINDS THAT WERE IN CHINA AT LITTLE OUT HERE ON THE THAMES THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR THOSE EXPORT MARKET
WELL IT IS BUT OF COURSE CHINA ISN'T THE ONLY MARKET OUT THERE WE ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE COULD MAKE FIND NICHES THAT THEY CAN EXPORT TOO AND CERTAINLY OUR PRODUCTS AND HIGH QUALITY WHAT WE'VE REALLY GOT TO DO IS TRY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO WANT TO EXPORT THEM TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THIS IS A PRACTICE AND EXPORT THINGS NOT JUST SERVICES HERE WE SEE THESE MASSIVE CONTAINERS
FULL OF GOODS BUT FRANKLY THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE STUFF COMING IN THAN EVER GOES OUT ISN'T IT WE CERTAINLY DO WE IMPORT SO MUCH MORE THAN WE EXPORT AND WE REALLY MUST CHANGE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO WATCH HER GET OUT OF THIS
TRADE DEFICIT THAT WE'RE IN AT THE MOMENT WHY'S THAT PROVING SUCH A DIFFICULT IN WATCHING THE CHANCE TO COULD DO ABOUT IT O.K. WELL THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT WE AS A NATION WE DON'T SEEM TO THINK OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AS A NEW MARKET AND ACTUALLY WE DON'T THINK OF IT AS AN INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT'S A LOT BUT HER MONEY UPFRONT THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT THERE YOU'VE GOT TO RESEARCH THE MARKET GOT TO TRY AND FIND THE RIGHT CHANNELS AND YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO DO THINGS LIKE
COMMIT TO LOCALISING A WEBSITE TRANSLATING DOCUMENTS TRYING TO GET INTO ALL THAT AND THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO I HONESTLY THINK IF HE COULD MUSTER SOME TAX RELIEF FOR THOSE HEAVY INVESTMENT YOU MAKE UP FRONT I HAD THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO INCENTIVISING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY TRY
THERE'S LONG BEEN A DEBATE HASN'T THERE AS TO WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IN THE SCENT SHOULD STEP BACK AND LET BUSINESS GET ON WITH IT OR HAS TO DO MORE HAND HOLDING I GET THE SENSE THAT YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN EASILY TAKE THE STEP INTO EXPORTING AND THEN SUDDENLY FIND IT'S RATHER HARDER THAN THE RHETORIC SUGGESTED YES A WICKED WICKED THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FIND THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY WENT BACK AND VISITED COMPANIES THAT THEY'D HELPED TO EXPORT SIX YEARS AGO AND SIX YEARS ON THEY FIND THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY FIFTY PER CENT OF THEM ARE STOPPED
IT'S A CONCLUSION THAT ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DON'T DO I'VE LEARNED THE DETAIL OF HOW TO DO THE BREAST OR THE EXPORTING MAKING THE SAILS ALL VERY WELL BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH THE REST
PROJECTS AS WELL GERMANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS TRADE AND THEY JUST BETTER AT THIS DO THEY JUST HER BETTER INSTINCTS ARE BETTER GOVERNMENT SUPPORT NO THEY PROBABLY HAVE BETTER GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN SOME WAYS BUT WHAT THEY ALSO HAVE HIS LARGER COMPANIES WE HAVE A PROLIFERATION OF VERY SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE SMALLER THE BUSINESS THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE THEY TEND TO BE MORE LIFESTYLE BUSINESSES AND WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE SET GET THOSE BUSINESSES TO GROW INTO THE NEXT LEVEL
AND TO ACTUALLY NOT FELT BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GET TO THAT NEXT LEVEL LESLEY BACHELOR DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF EXPORT THANKS FOR JOINING US HERE IN LONDON

THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED MET ON FRIDAY MORNING DOCTOR HEATHER JONES WILL BE EXAMINING A FAILED REBELLION FROM A CENTURY AGO
THE EASTER RISING IN DUBLIN ALONG WITH THE RISING IN PETROGRAD THE FOLLOWING YEAR STRIKE ME AS BEING THE LAST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY REVOLUTIONS SIX DAYS OF ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH CHANGED IRISH AND BRITISH HISTORY FOREVER
THE REBELS TOOK OVER THE GENERAL POST OFFICE DUBLIN'S G.P.O. AS THEIR HEADQUARTERS AND DECLARED THEY'D FOUND ISN'T IRISH REPUBLIC THE IDEA THAT A SMALL BAND OF ARMED MEN IF THEY TAKE THE KEY BUILDINGS IN THE CAPITAL CITY THEN THEY CAN TAKE THEIR COUNTRY THEIR UPRISING
BUT IT WOULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO MOST OF IRELAND LEAVING THE U.K. DOCTOR HEATHER JONES EXPLORES THE EASTER RISING NINETEEN SIXTEEN STARTING ON FRIDAY MORNING AT ELEVEN ON B.B.C. RADIO FOUR
IN THE NEXT HOUR ON THIS PROGRAMME BEN CASTLE IN THE FORMER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND WHY HE'S NOW BACKING TRUMP AND WE'LL HEAR FROM OSCAR TONY AN EMMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR JEREMY IRONS YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE
IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS PREPARING TO DELIVER HIS BUDGET WHICH WILL INCLUDE EXTRA MONEY FOR EDUCATION BUT SPENDING CUTS TO DONALD TRUMP HAS ONE MORE STATE PRIMARIES AND HIS BATTLE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CANDIDATE FOR U.S. PRESIDENT BUT HE'S ALSO LOST IN A KEY STATE
AND WALES ARE SET TO BECOME THE FIRST PART OF THE U.K. TO BAN EASE CIGARETTES IN MANY PUBLIC PLACES
THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WILL UNVEIL HIS EIGHTH BUDGET TODAY WITH A PROMISE TO PUT THE NEXT GENERATION FIRST HE'LL ANNOUNCE AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR EDUCATION OF MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS OVER THIS PARLIAMENT WITH PLANS TO FORCE EVERY STATE SCHOOL IN ENGLAND TO BECOME AN ACADEMY AND TO HELP SOME EXTEND THEIR SCHOOL DAY
THEY'LL BE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING AND TRANSPORT BUT MISTER OSBORNE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO CONFIRM AN EXTRA FOUR BILLION POUNDS IN SPENDING CUTS HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE VOTERS' VERDICT AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE HER CHANCE TO BE BOLD BUT FOR GEORGE OSBORNE IT POSES PROBLEMS WHICH COULD MEAN A CAUTIOUS APPROACH ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS DIPPED TAX RECEIPTS ARE EXPECTED TO AND THE CHANCELLOR'S CONSTRAINED BY HIS OWN FISCAL RULES TO REDUCE DEBT AS A SHARE OF G.D.P. AND CONVERT THE DEFICIT TO SURPLUS BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT
MISTER OSBORNE WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS A REFORMER AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO CAN BALANCE THE BOOKS SO TODAY HE'LL OUTLINE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EDUCATION EVERY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND WILL HAVE TO BECOME AN ACADEMY FREE FROM LOCAL COUNCIL CONTROL BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND WILL BE ABLE TO BID FOR FUNDING TO EXTEND THE SCHOOL DAY WITH EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SPORT OR DRAMA
WITH THE ADDED HIS POLITICAL CHALLENGE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE CHANCELLOR WILL AIM FOR ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY WITHOUT ALIENATING VOTERS OR THOSE IN HIS OWN PARTY
SLUGGISH GROWTH SINCE NOVEMBER'S AUTUMN STATEMENT MEANS THE CHANCELLOR HAS LESS ROOM TO MANOEUVRE IF HE'S TO MEET HIS SELF IMPOSED TARGET OF ACHIEVING A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMMAND AHMED ASSESSES THE MEASURES GEORGE OSBORNE COULD TAKE
TWO BIG NUMBERS MATTERED TO GEORGE OSBORNE IN THIS BUDGET THE AMOUNT THE GOVERNMENT BORROWED THIS YEAR THE DEFICIT AND THE TARGET OF A BUDGET SURPLUS OF TEN BILLION POUNDS BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ON BORROWING MANY BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT WILL MISS ITS TARGET OF SEVENTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS AS THE U.K. ECONOMY HAS SLOWED TO REACH IT AND THE SURPLUS TARGET GEORGE OSBORNE WILL NEED TO ANNOUNCE SIGNIFICANT TAX INCREASES AND CUT PUBLIC SPENDING FURTHER
PAX WRITERS COULD INCLUDE A FUEL DUTY INCREASE HIGHER RATES OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAXES AND NEW BUSINESS TAXES PUBLIC SECTOR CUTS ARE LIKELY TO FALL ON UNPROTECTED DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE HOME OFFICE AND JUSTICE MY OSBORNE ALWAYS LIKES TO MIX IN A BIT OF PLEASURE WITH THE PAIN FOR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A TAX CUT
AS THE CHANCELLOR RAISES THE POINT AT WHICH WE START PAYING INCOME TAX AND THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE HIGHER FORTY P. RATE OF TAX KICKS IN THERE WILL ALSO BE MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SUCH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL LINKS AS MISTER OSBORNE TRIES TO BUILD HIS WAY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS
DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN A FURTHER STEP TOWARDS SECURING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION WITH VICTORY IN THREE STATE PRIMARY ELECTIONS THE BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN SECURED THE SUPPORT OF ILLINOIS NORTH CAROLINA AND THE KEY BATTLEGROUND OF FLORIDA CAUSING THE STATE SENATOR AND FORMER FRONT RUNNER MARCO RUBIO TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE
MISTER TRUMP AT LAST OHIO TO THE STATE'S GOVERNOR JOHN CASE ICH WHO INSISTED THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON AND VOTES ARE STILL BEING COUNTED IN MISSOURI WHICH IS SAID TO BE TOO CLOSE TO CALL HILLARY CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETE A CLEAN SWEEP OF STATES OVER HER RIVAL BERNIE SANDERS MAKING HER THE CLEAR FAVOURITE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION ON NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOBEL REPORTS FROM FLORIDA
AND THEN THERE WERE THREE AFTER SENATOR MARCO RUBIO'S CRUSHING DEFEAT IN HIS HOME STATE OF FLORIDA AT THE HANDS OF DONALD TRUMP HE HAD LITTLE OPTION BUT TO END HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY AND A HIGHER WITH THE STATE'S GOVERNOR JOHN K. SIX SAW OFF THE TRUNK CHALLENGE AND WON AN IMPRESSIVE VICTORY
TRUMP H.Q. THEY CHEERED THEIR MAN BUT IT WAS A LOW KEY PERFORMANCE FROM HIM

THE BAN WOULD APPLY TO A LONG LIST OF PUBLIC PLACES INCLUDING CAFES PUBS THAT SERVE FOOD SPORTS GROUNDS AND SHOPS EXCEPT THOSE THAT SELL CIGARETTES THE WELSH GOVERNMENT ORIGINALLY WANTED THE MEASURES TO BE STRONGER BY PUTTING SO CALLED VAPOUR BEING ON A PAR WITH SMOKING TOBACCO PRODUCTS OPPOSITION FROM HEALTH CHARITIES SUCH AS CANCER RESEARCH U.K.
FORCED A RETHINK BUT THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER ANY E. CIGARETTE BAN HELPS OR HINDERS IMPROVEMENTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH CONTINUES IN ENGLAND OFFICIALS HAVE CHAMPIONED THEIR ROLE IN HELPING PEOPLE TO STOP SMOKING WHILE IN SCOTLAND OR NORTHERN ISLAND EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON RESTRICTING THEIR ROOFS BY YOUNG PEOPLE

THANK YOU CHRIS IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S BEEN ANOTHER NIGHT OF SUCCESS FOR DONALD TRUMP ANOTHER REPUBLICAN HOPEFUL MARCO RUBIO HAS FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE BUT MISTER TRUMP IS NOT THERE YET AND HE MAY STILL NOT GET THEIR DEFEAT IN THE STATE OF OHIO MEANS THAT THE MAN WHO WOULD BE PRESIDENT MAY STILL BE FIGHTING FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION
ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE CONVENTION WHICH PICKS THE PARTY'S CANDIDATE AND WANT TO THERE HE COULD FACE ATTEMPT BY THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT TO BLOCK A MAN THEY NEVER WANTED AND TO IMPOSE SOMEONE MORE TO THEIR POLITICAL TASTES INSTEAD
NO WONDER THEN THAT THE NORMALLY EBULLIENT FORM A STAR OF REALITY TELEVISION WAS SOUNDING JUST A LITTLE MUTED AS HE ADDRESSED HIS SUPPORTERS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE PRESSURE THE CUBS WITH RUBBING
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT LIES TO SEE VICIOUSNESS DISGUSTING REPORTERS HA
SOME OWNERS SOME SOME REALLY DISGUSTING PEOPLE BACK
I JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'RE GOING TO WIN FOR THE COUNTRY WE'RE GOING TO WIN WIN WIN AND WE'RE NOT STOPPING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT VICTORIES FOR OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT OF DONALD TRUMP'S RIVALS UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE NEUROSURGEON BEN CARSON HE WITHDREW FROM THE RACE DECLARING THAT HE WOULD BE BACK IN THE MAN WITH WHOM HE TRADED FREQUENT VERBAL BOYS I SPOKE TO MISTER CARSON YESTERDAY AND I ASKED HIM WHY HE SO MANY AMERICANS ARE NOW BACKING
YOU STOOD ALONGSIDE HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN INTO BATES WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO STAND ALONGSIDE HIM HE WASN'T ALWAYS POLITE ABOUT YES I RECOGNISE THE QUOTE ATMOSPHERE TO BANG POLITICIAN IN GENERAL DO YOU WOULD IT EXPEDIENT THAT MISS FAIRLIE IT ONE IS RIGHT BUT YOU'RE NOW BATTING THIS MAN TO BE PRESIDENT TO SAY HE'S DOING WHAT'S EXPEDIENT NOT WHAT'S RIGHT
YOU WARNED OF THE DANGER OF THIS SO CALLED BROKERED CONVENTION IN OTHER WORDS A SORT OF PARTY FIX TO BLOCK MISTER TRUMP WHAT DO YOU FEAR MIGHT HAPPEN NOW OR DO YOU FEAR THAT THE PARTY ESTABLISHMENT OR THINKING OF DOING WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING I DON'T KNOW IT WOULD BE THE END OF THE STORY THAT PEOPLE WILL PREPARED
WHAT ARE THE PERSONAL QUALITIES THAT YOU THINK MAKE HIM FIT TO BE THE LEADER OF YOUR COUNTRY
I MEAN THERE'S ONE REASON YOU MAY HAVE HESITATIONS ABOUT MY TRUMP ON THERE I THINK IN ONE DEBATE HE DESCRIBED HIS PATHOLOGICAL YEAH YOU WERE VERY FORGIVING MAN ABSOLUTELY IN POLITICAL CRAMPED WHEN YOU GET WORRIED ABOUT TRADITIONAL LOOK O.K. BUT EDITOR AND I DON'T I'M NOT ENGAGING BUT EARNEST NOW I WAS NOT ONLY DID HE SAY PATHOLOGICAL I THINK IN THE SAME PARAGRAPH HE REFERRED TO PAEDOPHILES AND THESE EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT TO MAKE AGAINST A COLLEAGUE IN HIS OWN PARTY WASN'T IT
SO DONALD TRUMP INSULTS YOU DURING THE HEAT OF A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AND YOU THINK THIS MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER THE DEER AND WHOLE STRETCHES OVER PARTICULARLY ANNOYING WHAT MOTIVATES AND IS IT WITH SOME REGRET THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER A CANDIDATE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF BUT CLEARLY IT WAS VERY MOVING WITH THE AMERICAN SILVER PIN
DOCTOR CARSON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME IT'S NOW FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT IS BUSINESS LOOKING FOR IN THEIR BUDGET TODAY MATTHEW PRICES AT CHELTENHAM RACECOURSE THERE'S BEEN MIXING WITH SOME BUSINESS LEADERS ON THEIR DAY OUT MATTHEW INDEED SARAH THANKS VERY MUCH THE GOING HERE AT CHELTENHAM IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IT'S GOOD TO SOFT TODAY I CAN'T WORK OUT WHETHER THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC ANALOGY YOU'RE NOT GEORGE OSBORNE IS STRUGGLING AS WE KNOW TO FIND MORE MONEY THERE WILL PRESUMABLY HAVE TO BE SOME FORM OF TAX RISES IN THE BUDGET
AND THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO WILL HELICOPTER IN HERE SHORTLY FOR DAY TWO WILL BE WATCHING FOR THOSE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN HIT BY THE HIKING INSURANCE TAX THE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY AUTO ENROLMENT IN PENSIONS AND THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE SO IS BUSINESS FEELING LEANED ON BY THE CHANCELLOR I WANDERED AROUND HERE TO FIND OUT
RIGHT SO HERE'S THE BENTLEY STAIN
THERE'S A CHAMPAGNE STAND THE FIVE TONNES OF SALMON NINE TONS OF POTATOES IN FOUR DAYS I'LL TELL YOU ALL WHAT ANYTHING
FIRST I'M PERFECT POCKET THAT YOU CARRIED ON AND CARRIED ON I THINK GOOD LUCK THANK YOU
IT GENERATES ONE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS FOR THE GLOUCESTERSHIRE ECONOMY
GENERATES A LOT OF MONEY OF COURSE FOR THE BETTING FIRMS WHO WERE HIT HARD BY SOME OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S PREVIOUS BUDGET TO DECISIONS SO WE DON'T EXPECT ANY INCREASES IN DUTIES BETTING ONLINE BETTING WHAT ARE CONFRONTING AXMINSTER USED TO DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN SILLINESS IS ALREADY HAD A VERY SUBSTANTIAL TAXES THAT'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SKY BETTING AND GAMING RICHARD FLINT WHO IS ONE OF THOSE WHO THINKS THE WORDS
TAX GEORGE AND OSBORNE FIT INTO THE SAME SENTENCE THEY ARE STILL TAXES THEY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE AND THAT'S A CHANCELLOR I MEAN LOOKING BACK OVER HIS SIX YEARS WOULD YOU SAY HE'S BEEN MORE FRIENDLY FOR BUSINESS THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT LESS FRIENDLY FOR BUSINESS THAN YOU'D EXPECT
I THINK IF ANYTHING SLIGHTLY LESS FRIENDLY THAN WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED I GUESS CORPORATION TAX BEEN FAVOURABLE BUT THERE MANY MORE HIDDEN TAX
WANDERING ROUND HERE YOU DON'T JUST BUMP INTO TRAINERS AND JOCKEYS BUT ALSO PLENTY OF BUSINESS LEADERS OPINION FORMERS MANY OF WHOM
DAY OFF SOME WHO WILL AMONG THEM SIMON FRENCH A FORMER GOVERNMENT ECONOMIST OF THE CABINET OFFICE
WHO'S NOW CHIEF ECONOMIST AT GORDON AND CO AND HE BELIEVES THAT GEORGE OSBORNE'S RECORD
BUSINESS FRIENDLY POLICY USES EGGS I THINK HE'S DONE SOME VERY POSITIVE THINGS IN THIS
EARLY PART OF THIS PARLIAMENT OF PROTECTING CAPITAL SPENDING THAT HAS TO BE TEMPERED AGAINST THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT WAGE INCREASES COMING THROUGH THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE THE APPRENTICESHIP LAVVY OR TORN ROMANS INTO PRIVATE PENSIONS THERE ARE ALL INCREMENTAL JOBS TAXES IS HE HAS A CHANCE
BEGINNING TO BE SEEN AS UNFRIENDLY TO BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT HE RETAINS THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE U.K.
HE MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND IF YOU NEED TO DELAY BY EAR BY TWO YEARS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SENSIBLE THING TO DO NOT THE IDEOLOGICAL THING TO DO THEN YOU MUST SHOW HE'S PREPARED TO DO
HELICOPTERS BUSY FLYING THE ELITE HERE AWAY THERE'S A FLEET OF BENTLEY'S TURNING UP NOW
TAKE THEM THE SHORT DISTANCE UP THE COURSE TO WHERE THE HELICOPTERS ARE WAITING AND IN THE QUEUE IS DI WALTERS ONE OF WALES'S RICHEST MEN HE AND HIS SON OWNER MINING COMPANY AN ENGINEERING FIRM
DOES HE THINK GEORGE OSBORNE'S DOING A GOOD JOB AT THE RECORD FOR ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT
IT'S RIGHT TO STICK WITH AUSTERITY IS DEFINITELY GOING TO DO SO IS THAT CREATING A FAVOURABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'VE GOT A SICK ROYA POLITICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY
THE CROWDS ARE DRIFTING OFF THE CLEARING UP HERE NOW READY FOR DAY TWO AT THE RACES BACK IN TWENTY TEN BUSINESS LEADERS AND ECONOMISTS ON THE WHOLE BOUGHT INTO THE IDEA THAT TITAN IN WAS NEEDED
WELL THERE IS CERTAINLY
LESS UNANIMITY NOW BUT DESPITE THAT WE WILL GET ANOTHER AUSTERITY BUDGET LATER TODAY
MATTHEW PRICE THERE IT'S NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN LABOUR HAVE SUSPENDED ONE OF THEIR ACTIVISTS FOR A SECOND TIME FOR POSTING ANTI SEMITIC TWEETS
VICKY KIRBY WAS FUR SUSPENDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN SHE WAS A PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATE SHE'D SAID JEWS HAVE BIG NOSES AND THEY SLAUGHTER THE OPPRESSED WE ASKED IT EMERGED THAT ANOTHER LABOUR PARTY MEMBER HAD COMPLAINED TO POLICE ABOUT HER COMMENTS AND THAT SHE HAD NOT ONLY BEEN REINSTATED BUT ELECTED THE LOCAL PARTY'S VICE CHAIRMAN JEREMY NEWMARK IS CHAIR OF THE JEWISH LABOUR MOVEMENT AND HE'S HERE WITH ME
IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SARAH AND THIS OF COURSE AT A TIME WHEN THE LABOUR PEER BARONESS ROYAL IS CARRYING OUT AN INVESTIGATION INTO ANTI SEMITE ISM AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S LABOUR CLUB AND THEIR ALLEGATIONS OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS AT THE L.S.E. DOES THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANTI SEMITIC
ANTI SERVANTS EMMETT ISMS NEVER BEEN THE SOLE PRESERVE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT IN FACT IT WAS A BIT OF FORMER GERMAN SOCIALIST POLITICIAN WHO DESCRIBED ANTI SUMMAT HE'S UM ON THE LEFT IS THE SOCIALISM OF FALLS AND I THINK UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS IS AN APPARENT RESURGENCE OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF ANTI SEMITE ISM WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM LABOUR PARTY TODAY
SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE TOP IS ACCEPTING THAT JEREMY CORBIN IT'S NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS SINCE HE BECAME LEADER THAT THAT
WHY AT HER IT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO MUCH I THINK TWO THINGS AS HAPPENED THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE CHANGE IN SHIFT IN THE MEMBERSHIP BASE OF THE LABOUR PARTY AT GRASS ROOTS LEVEL AND IT APPEARS THAT WITHIN THAT SURGEON MEMBERS THERE IS A POCKET POSSIBLY A VERY SMALL POCKET OF PEOPLE THAT DO HARBOUR THESE PROBLEMATIC VIEWS AND AT THE SAME TIME WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS
AN APPARENT IMPOTENCE AND INABILITY OF THE LEADERSHIP AND THE TOP OF THE PARTY TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES IN A SWIFT AND FERMANAGH IN THE SAME WAY THAT ANY OTHER FORM OF RACISM WOULD BE TREATED AND DEALT WITH TODAY ARE YOU HEARING MORE THAN WE'VE REPORTED ON
I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE HEARD AT THE JEWISH LABOUR MOVEMENT AND WE REACT IN MANY WAYS A KIND OF LIGHTNING ROD FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM PROBLEMS OF THIS NATURE THAT PARTICULARLY ON CAMPUS YES THE PROBLEM IS GREATER THAN THAT HAS BEEN SURFACE TO DATE
AND JEREMY CORBIN AND OF COURSE HIMSELF CAN'T CONTROL WHO BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE LABOUR PARTY WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT HE SHOULD DO
WELL LOOK WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS A SCENARIO IN WHICH THE POLITICAL RHETORIC OF ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANTI CEMETERIES WHICH JEREMY CORBIN AND OTHER LEADING FIGURES IN THE PARTY HAVE DELIVERED VERY WELL AND VERY CLEARLY AND VERY EFFECTIVELY IN RECENT WEEKS SHE NEEDS TO BE MATCHED WITH ACTION AND EIGHT EXAMPLES LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU INTRODUCE A SECTION WITH TODAY APPEAR TO SHOW THAT THE PARTY'S STRUCTURES SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
DON'T SEEM TO BE GEARED UP FOR DEALING WITH CONTEMPORARY ANTI CEMETERIES UM IN THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE WOULD EXPECT SO WHAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HE CAN DO BECAUSE I'M JUST AND AS FAR AS VICKY KIRBY'S CONCERNED DO YOU KNOW WHEN SHE RE JOIN THE LABOUR PARTY I THINK THE TIME LINE ON THE VICKY KIRBY INCIDENT IT IS UNCLEAR AND HOPEFULLY THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NEW INVESTIGATION WE WILL DISCLOSE THAT
BUT FUND THEM COS IT COULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE JEREMY CORGAN BECAME LEADER I THINK IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WAS AND WHAT HE CAN DO WOULD YOU EXPECT THERE TO BE DISCUSSIONS AT THE SHADOW CABINET LEVEL ON THIS
I THINK THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THERE TO BE DISCUSSIONS AT ALL LEVELS IN THE PARTY I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT OFTEN PEOPLE IN THE SHADOW CABINET INCLUDING JEREMY CORBIN HIMSELF HAVE DELIVERED FANTASTIC RHETORIC PLEDGES AND COMMITMENTS ABOUT ZERO TOLERANCE ON ANTI SEMITES BUT NOW THEY NEED TO ACT AND ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES OF THE PARTY AND ABLE WITH MATCH ACTION WITH RHETORIC JEREMY KNEW MARK THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU
THE TIME NOW IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN DOG OWNERS ARE BEING WARNED ABOUT A DEADLY TICK BORNE DISEASE THAT IS NOW IN THE U.K. A FOURTH CASE OF THE LIFE THREATENING DISEASE BUBBY'S HE OH SIS HAS BEEN FOUND IN ESSEX IT'S TRANSMITTED TO DOGS BY TICKS INFECTED WITH THE BABBY EASIER PARASITE AND DOCKED IN ESSEX ARE BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE CONTRACTED IT I'VE I'M A CORRESPONDENT CLARE MARSHALL REPORTS
GOOD GIRL JUST OUT WALKING MY DOG FLOW IT'S COLD BUT SPRING IS COMING AND SO THE TICKS I'M GOING TO BE CHECKING HER CAREFULLY THIS YEAR BECAUSE IN ESSEX A NEW DISEASE POTENTIALLY FATAL TO DOGS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED
CLIVE THWAITES IS A VET AT THE FOREST VETERINARY CENTRE IN HARLOW THE WORST I'VE SEEN IS THE DOG DIED THERE SERIOUSLY ALL DOGS THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED THERE'S BEEN FOUR IN HOLLOW THREE WITHIN THIS PRACTICE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE ESTABLISHED AN OUTBREAK OF THE DISEASE IN THIS COUNTRY
TAKES WORK LIKE MOSQUITOES THEY SPREAD DISEASE WHEN THEY'D BITE THE PARASITE INTO THE BLOODSTREAM ENTERS THEMSELVES AND THEN IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO KILL THE PARASITE AND THE DOOR WOULD ACTUALLY DESTROY ITS OWN BLOOD CELLS SO THEY BECOME VERY VERY MEAN
THE ONLY WAY IS TO KILL THE TICKS QUICKLY BECAUSE THE TAKE HAS TO BE FEELING FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE IT TRANSMITS THE DISEASE BUT NOT ALL TECH PRODUCT WILL DO
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THESE INFECTED TIGS WILL STAY IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG WELL AT PRESENT WE'VE GOT ONE VERY WELL DEFINED LOCALISED AREA THE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE IS THAT EVERY FEMALE TICK WILL A COUPLE OF THOUSAND EGGS AND ALL THOSE OFFSPRING ALL CARRY DISEASE ALSO AND EVEN IF YOU DO ALL THAT YOU
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE SO IF YOU DO FIND HER TAKE ON YOUR DOG GET ADVICE FROM A VET VERY GOOD THAT'S A GOOD LOOK AT IT
CLAIRE MARSHALL REPORTING THERE WELL THE BROADCASTER CHRIS PACKHAM JOINS US IN BRISTOL BRISTOL GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING SIR IF IT IS IN THE COUNTRY IS IT NOW INEVITABLE THAT IT WILL SPREAD BEYOND ESSEX
TICKS ARE VERY GOOD AT THEIR JOB THEY FIND A HOST TO SUCK BLOOD THEY PRODUCE A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG AS CLIVE SAID THEY WERE UP TO THREE THOUSAND IN THE SPECIES WHICH CARRIES THIS NEW DISEASE WEATHER CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED TO BE FAR MORE FAVOURABLE FOR THEM THEIR WARM WINTER THAT WE'VE JUST HAD
AND THE LONG DAMP PERIODS WE'VE HAD ARE PERFECT FOR THESE SAD MOST OF THEM THEY'RE SPENDING A LONGER TIME ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THEY'RE ACTIVE EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND WE HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOGS ARE HUGE OBVIOUSLY RESERVOIR OF SMALL MAMMAL ANOTHER SPECIES THERE YES THAT THEY WILL SPREAD THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT SO WELCOME DOG OWNERS DO BECAUSE ONE THING TO REGULARLY CHECK YOUR DOG METH MOST DOG OWNERS WOULD DO THAT
OCCASIONALLY FIND A TAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY THAT BUT WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY RECENTLY AND FOUND THAT FIFTY PERCENT OF DOG OWNERS DIDN'T REALISE THAT THEY'RE COOKED HER PETS WERE CAPABLE OF CATCHING LYME DISEASE AND THERE'D BE EASIER SO IT APPEARS THAT AN EDUCATIONAL EXERCISES REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOG OWNER KNOWS THAT TICKS ARE POTENTIALLY A PROBLEM FOR THEM AND ALSO FOUGHT FOR THEMSELVES NOT JUST THE DOG OF COURSE
SO WE HAVE TO CREATE A WIDER AWARENESS OF THAT BUT IF YOUR DOG DOES PICK UP TICKS AND YOU FIND THEM ATTACHED TO IT WHICH CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE THE NYMPH OR STAGE OF THESE ANIMALS IS VERY VERY SMALL THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY TO AVERT WHERE THE VET WILL GIVE THEM BEST ADVICE AND THEY WERE SPOT ON THEY WERE SPRAYS THERE OUR COLLARS AND THEY WERE ALL OR CHEWABLE TABLETS WHICH WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT VIGILANCE IS WHAT'S REQUIRED HERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROBLEM MANAGER THANK YOU BUT YOU ARE YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT ANY DOG OWNER WHO FINDS A TICK SHOULD TAKE THE DOG TO THE VET ARE YOU
WELL IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH OF YOUR DOG IT'S A BIT LIKE IT ONLY TAKES ONE MOSQUITO TO BITE YOU TO INFECT YOU WOULD ONLY TAKES ONE INFECTED TICKED ABOUT YOUR DOG FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME AND YOUR DOG WILL BE INFECTED THERE PUT THEM WITH THE NEW DISEASE IS THAT WHILST IT'S PREVALENT IN EUROPE ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND VETERINARY PRACTICES
ARE USED TO SEEING IT IN THIS COUNTRY AS CLIVE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT YOU HEARD IN THE REPORT THERE THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH IS NEW IT'S NOT ON THEIR RADAR AND I FEAR THAT A LOT OF IT WILL BE MISTER SYMPTOMS THAT PRESENTER ANAEMIA LETHARGY
THE BLOOD PARASITE IS EXTREMELY SMALL SO EVEN IF A BLOOD SAMPLE IS TAKEN IT'S DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY SO IT'S GOING TO BE SOME TIME BEFORE VETS IN THE U.K. SORT OF HAVE THIS ON THEIR RADAR AND THROUGHOUT THAT PERIOD OF LEARNING I'M AFRAID THAT IT WILL START TO SPREAD SO YES IF YOU'RE A DOG OWNER AND YOU HAVE A TICK ON YOUR DOG IT MAY SOUND LIKE A OVER DRAMATISING THE SITUATION BUT RATHER AS A SEPARATE MALARIA IT ONLY TAKES ONE BITE AND JUST A BRIEF THOUGHT YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT LYME DISEASE AND PRESUMABLY THIS DISEASE COULD CAN
WE CAUGHT BY HUMAN SO IS IT GOING TO BE AS POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT FOR HUME
GET IT CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR MISSED THE ANIMAL HEALTH BRISTOL UNIVERSITY LAUNCHED A BIG TRICK PROJECT WE'VE HAD A FANTASTIC RESPONSE FIFTY HUNDRED VETERINARY PRACTICES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE GIVEN US THIS APPEAL TO YOU I'M SURE BUT THEY'VE GIVEN US SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO TICKS AND THEY'VE COME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THESE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ANALYSED NOW LOOKING FOR PATHOGENS LIKE LINED LIKE THIS WILL BE EASIER AND THE
RESULTS WILL BE FULLY AVAILABLE IN JULY AT THE MOMENT THE INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE PATHOGENS IS WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS YOU KNOW LYME DISEASE CAN BE VERY SERIOUS IN HUMANS CAPABLE OF BEING TRANSMITTED VIA TIC WHICH COULD COME FROM YOUR DOG OR DIRECTLY ONTO YOURSELF WHILE YOU'RE WALKING IT AND IF IT ISN'T DIAGNOSED IN THE EARLY STAGES CAN BE VERY SERIOUS POTENTIALLY FATAL I KNOW A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT
IT'S EXTREMELY DEBILITATING IT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU WANT TO AVOID NOW AS A AS A ZOOLOGIST I HAVE TO SAY AT THIS POINT I DON'T WANT TO DEMONISE TIPPEX BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK PEOPLE TO DO IS RECOGNISE THE PRESENCE OF THIS ORGANISM AND BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IF YOU MANAGE IT YOU CAN LIVE ALONGSIDE IT SUCCESSFULLY ARE BOTH YOURSELF AND YOUR DOG CAN REMAIN HEALTHY CHRIS PACKHAM THANKS SO MUCH

I WOULD REITERATE THAT POINT AND SAY ACTUALLY I'VE GOT TO SAY WE'VE GOT TO SAVE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS A MILLION POUNDS PER WEEK IN ORDER TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T RUN A DEFICIT AT ALL WHAT'S THAT LIKELY TO BE WE ALREADY HAD ABOUT CHARGES AND POTHOLES STREET LIGHTS GOING OUT AND SOCIAL CARE TIMES BEING SQUEEZED ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CUTS TO SERVICES I THINK THAT ONE OF THE OTHER BIG ISSUES I NEED TO ADDRESS FIRST OF ALL IS THE ISSUE ABOUT THE OLDER POPULATION
ACTUALLY THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLDS WITHIN ESSEX WILL DOUBLE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE OVER SIXTY FIVE CATEGORY IS PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY TWO PER CENT OF A POPULATION SO I MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE ARE INCREASING PRESSURES ON OUR BUDGET
BOTH IN TERMS OF ELDERLY POPULATION AND THE SERVICES THEY NEED AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR COUNCIL TAX UP BY ALMOST FOUR PERCENT LAST YEAR TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS COMING YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT WE TOOK THE PRECEPT OF ONE POINT NINE NINE PER CENT OUI WE DID RELUCTANTLY DO THE SOCIAL CARE PUT LEVY AS WELL HAVE TWO PER CENT YOU ARE LOYAL CONSERVATIVE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE UNHELPFUL TO THE CHANCELLOR BUT IF HE STANDS UP SAYS THIS CAN BE DONE IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST I THINK YOU'RE TELLING US NOT THAT EASY NO
I THINK I THINK THE ANSWER THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THAT HE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE DEVOLUTION DEAL IF IT WOULD GET ON WITH IT THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THAT IN ESSEX QUITE FRANKLY WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE TOOLS TO GROW THE ECONOMY OF THIS COUNTY FROM THE THIRTY THREE BILLION TO SIXTY BILLION SO WE JUST NEED TO GET ON WITH IT
BUT MORE CUTS ARE GOING TO HURT COUNSELLOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED COUNCILLOR DAVID FINCH THEIR LEADER OF ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND MANY FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE BUDGET LATER THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTS THAT THE
GEORGE OSBORNE WILL BREAK A SECOND OF THE THREE FINANCIAL ROSE HE SET HIMSELF AFTER LAST YEAR'S ELECTION ADMIT HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE GOVERNMENT DEBT AS A SHARE OF TOTAL ECONOMIC PRODUCTION THE F.T. PREDICTS THAT WITH LOW GROWTH THE CHANCELLOR WILL PENCIL IN SPENDING CUTS FOR LATER IN THE PARLIAMENT TO KEEP HIS THIRD PROMISE OF RUNNING A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWENTY TWENTY IN THE INDEPENDENT SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL ARGUES THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S CUTS ARE A POLITICAL CHOICE WITH NO ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS
THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS TO MAKE FAR REACHING CHANGES TO THE WAY IT DEALS WITH SEX ABUSE CASES AFTER A HIGHLY CRITICAL REPORT SAID IT REPEATEDLY FAILED TO ACT ON A SURVIVOR'S COMPLAINTS THE PAPER NAMES THREE BISHOPS IT UNDERSTANDS WERE TOLD OF THE ABUSE THEY WEREN'T IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S OFFICE WAS ALSO CRITICISED
FOR FAILING TO RESPOND TO A SURVIVOR AND THE PAPER SAYS JUSTIN WELBY IS GIVEN A PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO IMPLEMENT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS LEAVING MESSAGES ON THE JUST GIVING WEBSITE HAS COST CHARITIES MILLIONS OF POUNDS IN TAX ACCORDING TO THE TIMES THE PAPER SAYS THAT OFFICIALS AND H.M. REVENUE AND CUSTOMS INSTRUCTED JUST GIVING STAFF TO REMOVE GIFT AID IF THE MESSAGE REFERRED TO MORE THAN ONE PERSON THIS INCLUDED SUPPORTIVE NOTES SUCH AS FROM MUM AND DAD
IT'S THOUGHT THAT ONE IN FOR DONATIONS WERE AFFECTED AND H.M.R.C. SPOKESMAN CONTACT WHO WAS CONTACTED BY THE PAPAL INITIALLY BLAMED ERRORS BY JUST GIVING BUT THEN SAID LAST NIGHT THAT ALL INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM GIFT AID EVEN IF THEY DID INCLUDE EXTRA NAMES THE SON CARRIES A PICTURE OF A GIANT FERRIS WHEEL IN THE WEST MIDLANDS AND ASK IS THIS THE U.K.'S WORST ATTRACTION A MALE CALLS IT A WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE THE ORGANISERS BASED IT WILL GIVE A BIRD'S EYE VIEW
DUDLEY TOWN CENTRE BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE NOT SO IMPRESSED ONE TELLS THE SUN THAT THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN FOOT RIDE WILL GIVE PEOPLE VIEW OF AN ABANDONED BINGO HALL AND A SHOPPING CENTRE HOWEVER A SPOKESMAN FOR THE LOCAL MARKET TRADERS' ASSOCIATION SAYS HE HOPES THE WHEEL WILL PUT DUDLEY BACK ON THE MAP
I'M SURE IT WELL IT IS BECAUSE SIXTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE ARE MANY ACTORS WHO HAVE WON AN OSCAR A TONY AND AN EMMY FOR THEIR WORK ON THE FILM AND STAGE AND TELEVISION JEREMY IRONS IS ONE OF THEM IT'S SIX YEARS SINCE HE WAS LAST ON STAGE BUT LATER THIS MONTH HE RETURNS TO STAR IN EUGENE O'NEILL'S LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT AT THE BRISTOL OLD VIC THE THEATRE WHERE HE MADE HIS PROFESSIONAL DEBUT BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE A ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES HAS BEEN TO TALK TO HIM
I'M LEARNING I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN ACTOR A SURPRISING ADMISSION FROM JEREMY IRONS A STAR WHOSE CAREER SPANS NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AS HE REHEARSES LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT WITH LESLEY MANVILLE
WE'RE IN FOR ANOTHER NIGHT OF FOUR I'M AFRAID OH WELL I WON'T MIND IT TONIGHT NO I DON'T IMAGINE YOU
EVERY DAY I COME IN AND I FEEL LIKE A PLUMBER AND THINK I CAN'T DO IT SO IT NEVER GETS EASIER IT'S ALWAYS START FROM THE BOTTOM AGAIN
I'VE GOT TO GET DRESSED NO PLEASE WAIT A LITTLE WHILE AT LEAST TILL ONE OF THE BOYS COMES DOWN YOU ARE LEAVING ME SOON BUT YOU ARE LEAVING US MARY IT'S A FAMILY DRAMA ABOUT LOVE LOSS AND ADDICTION AND IS SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS THE SADDEST AMERICAN PLAY EVER WRITTEN BUT IT'S ALSO REGARDED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN PLAYS EVER WRITTEN
SO WHEN RICHARD EYRE ASKED JEREMY IRONS IF HE'D LIKE TO STAR IN IT IT WAS A SIMPLE DECISION I LEAPT AT IT
THE ICING ON THE CAKE WAS THAT RICHARD WANTED TO DO IT NOT ON BROADWAY NOT IN THE WEST END BUT AT THE BRISTOL OLD VIC WHICH IS WHERE I STARTED IN THE SIXTIES WHERE I TRAINED WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN ON STAGE MORE RECENTLY I THINK IT'S BECAUSE MY FILM WORK IS KEPT ME BUSY AND THAT'S HOW IT STARTS
THE FEVER THE RAY HE'LL APPEAR AS ALFRED THE BUTLER IN BATMAN V. SUPERMAN LATER THIS MONTH BUT GOOD
I'M LOATH TO DO UP A LONG WESTERN
I THINK AS I GET OLDER I LIKE TO WORK A BIT LESS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT PARTS AROUND THAT I HAVEN'T PLAYED DO YOU HANKER AFTER SOME OF THOSE BIG WOLSELEY KINGLY NO I DON'T HANKER AFTER IT CERTAINLY I MEAN THEY ARE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB
THIS PLAY LIKE THIS JOURNEY TONIGHT IS ALSO A MOUNTAIN BUT I HAVE GREAT FELLOW CLIMBERS JEREMY IRONS WAS PRIVATELY EDUCATED BEFORE JOINING THE THEATRE SCHOOL IN BRISTOL
HIS BIG BREAK CAME WHEN HE PAID A QUINTESSENTIAL ENGLISHMAN IN THE TELEVISION ADAPTATION OF BRIDESHEAD REVISITED
WILL BE AWARE OF THE DISCUSSIONS AT THE MOMENT AROUND THE IDEA THAT ACTING HAS BECOME THE PRESERVE OF THE PRIVILEGED DOES THAT STRIKE ANY CHORD WITH YOU
WELL I KEEP READING IT AND WE DO HAVE A FEW SORT OF TOP LINE IS AT THE MOMENT
PIERRE DE RONDA EATEN I THINK THAT'S PERHAPS A BIT OF A COINCIDENCE ALTHOUGH I AM AWARE WHAT IT COSTS STUDENTS NOW TOO
BUT I WORKED IN MANY OTHER THINGS WHEN I WAS TRAINING WHEN I WAS STARTING OUT I WAS A BUILDER I I WAS A SOCIAL WORKER YOU WERE A BUSKER I WAS A BUS I WAS A GARDENER AS A HOUSE CLEANER
ALL JOBS WHICH I PRESUME ARE STILL AVAILABLE TODAY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE RENT YOUR BEDSIT WHILE YOU'RE
JEREMY IRONS DOESN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY NOW IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT HE WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIVATE DONORS TO THE LABOUR PARTY NOW HE SAYS HE FEELS DISILLUSIONED WITH POLITICS WE HAVE GOT THE E.U. REFERENDUM COMING UP ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
I'M DITHERING AT THE MOMENT I THINK LIKE MANY PEOPLE I'M A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED BY THE STANDARD OF DEBATE SEEMS TO BE BEING TO CERTAIN SENT INTO A GAME SHOW BETWEEN MISTER CAMERON MISTER JOHNSON
I WOULD LIKE OUR POLITICIANS TO RESPECT US AS VOTERS I'M NOT PLAYING TO SOME SORT OF GAME SHOW IF YOU WERE OFFERED A KNIGHTHOOD IT WOULD YOU ACCEPT IT I BECAME AN ACTION COULD BE A ROGUE AND A VAGABOND
AND PLAY BY MY OWN RULES SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT TO PULL ME IN AS ONE OF THEIR OWN FOR I AIN'T
JEREMY IRONS TALKING TO REBECCA JONES IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US HERE IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING IS THE REVEREND LUCY WHEN KIP GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
PETER MAXWELL DAVIES THE COMPOSER WHO DIED ON MONDAY OFTEN WROTE MUSIC INSPIRED BY THE SEA AND LIKE THE SEA HIS MUSIC WAS NOT OFTEN STILL BUT ALWAYS CHANGING RESTIVE ON THE MOVE
IN HIS SETTING OF PSALM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HE TOOK SERIOUSLY THE DRAMATIC BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER IMAGERY AS A DESCRIPTION OF LIFE YAY THE WATERS HAD DROWNED US AND THE STREAM HAD GONE OVER MY SOUL
FOR ME THE INTENSITY OF HIS MUSIC INVITED ME ALWAYS TO BE IMMERSED IN IT AS ONE MIGHT DIVE INTO THE SEA
THIS IMMERSIVE MUSIC CAME FROM A MAN WHO IN SOME WAYS WAS FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
A SELF DECLARED REPUBLICAN HE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT MONARCHY A COMPOSER WHO TOOK UP CONDUCTING BECAUSE HE SAID OTHER CONDUCTORS FOUND HIS MUSIC TOO HARD
A COMPOSER OF MANY ANTHEMS FOR THE CHURCH WHO WAS VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO ORGANISED RELIGION
A MILDLY SPOKEN MAN IN PERSON WHO HAD AN IRON WILLED AND UNCOMPROMISING COMMITMENT TO THE EXPRESSION OF EXTREMES
HIS NINETEEN SIXTY NINE PIECE EIGHT SONGS FOR A MAD KING DESCRIBING THE LIFE OF KING GEORGE THE THIRD IS STILL SHOCKING TO LISTEN TO AND I IMAGINE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM
WHEN A MUSICAL VOICE FALL SILENT THERE'S A SENSE OF LOSS THERE WILL BE NO MORE MUSIC FROM THIS WORLD RENOWNED BRITISH CONTEMPORARY MUSICIAN
HE LEAVES OVER THREE HUNDRED WORKS INCLUDING TEN SYMPHONIES AND FROM THIS ENFANT TERRIBLE OF THE MUSIC ESTABLISHMENT ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIS MUSIC IS DIFFICULT
DIFFICULT TO PLAY DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO
AND HIS DIFFICULT MUSIC IT SEEMS TO ME LEAVES A GIFT THAT IS PARADOXICALLY HELPFUL IN THESE FEW DAYS BEFORE HOLY WEEK BEGINS ON PALM SUNDAY THIS WEEKEND
DESPITE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIS OWN VIGOROUS STRUGGLES WITH FAITH HIS MUSIC EXPRESSES FOR IS A SENSE THAT SOMETIMES MATTERS OF THE HEART PREOCCUPATIONS OF THE SPIRIT ARE SIMPLY DIFFICULT UNRESOLVED
AND THAT THIS UNRESOLVED THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A STOCK PLACE BUT CAN BE A PLACE OF CREATIVE QUESTIONING THAT ACKNOWLEDGES WE DON'T AND CAN'T KNOW EVERYTHING AND THAT SOMETIMES ALL WE CAN DO IS SING
PETER MAXWELL DAVIES IS DISCORDANT SETTING OF THE PSALM WHICH ENDS OUR HELP STAND US IN THE NAME OF THE LORD WHO HATH MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH PROVOKES ME TO GRATITUDE
EVEN FOR WHAT IS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE OF FAITH AND IN A LIFE FULL OF CONTRADICTION AND COMPLICITY
I THINK SOMEHOW MAX AS HE WAS KNOWN KNEW ABOUT THIS AND TOLD THE WORLD ABOUT IT IN HIS MUSIC
AND SO IT IS MUSIC TO PREPARE US FOR THE HARSH DETAILS OF HOLY WEEK I HEAR INNIT AN INVITATION TO STICK WITH OUR OWN DISSONANCE TO LOOK FOR BEAUTY IN IT AND AN INVITATION TO THANK GOD NOT ONLY FOR THEIR RESOLUTIONS BUT FOR THE CONTRADICTIONS THEMSELVES
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND LUCY WINK KIT IT'S NOW SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT
WELSH ASSEMBLY IS EXPECTED TO VOTE TODAY TO BAN HIS CIGARETTES IN PLACES WHERE CHILDREN ARE PRESENT IT WOULD BE THE FIRST BAND OF ITS KIND ANYWHERE IN THE U.K. WOULD MEAN NICOTINE INHALERS COULDN'T BE USED IN SCHOOLS OR WHERE FOOD IS SERVED OR ON POP PUBLIC TRANSPORT WELL DAVID REES IS WELSH LABOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIRS THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE COMMITTEE
IN CARDIFF PROFESSOR LINDA BOLD IS CARRYING OUT WORK AT STIRLING UNIVERSITY FOR CANCER RESEARCH U.K. INTO HOW HER BEHAVIOUR CAN PREVENT CANCER GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING DAVID RHYS YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AREN'T YOU I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE GOVERNMENT BILL A STUFFED ON YES WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR DOING THIS
WHEN THE COMMITTEE HAVE LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE AND PROFESSOR BORDERS ONE OF THOSE WHO GAVE EVIDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE HE CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT THE MAJORITY MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A CONCERT THERE'S CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF NORMALISATION PARTICULARLY WITH THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT THE DISCOVERY NORMALISATION WITH SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT SO WE WASHED THE WHISKER WELSH GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY TAKE SOME ACTION TO RESTRICT ITS ORIGINAL PROPOSALS AND COME BACK WITH PROPOSALS WHICH FOCUS ON THAT AREA O.K. DID RE NORMALISATION MEANING CHILDREN SEE ADULTS OF APING AND THINK IT'S NORMAL THAT'S MY ROLE MODEL WILL BE NON MAGICIAN SEE IN THAT YES THEY SEE ADULTS YOU GENTLY CIGARETTES AND THE BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS THAT ARE USED AS A SIMILAR PERIOD APART PATTERN SMOKE TOBACCO AND THEN THAT'S A POSSIBILITY INTO
OH KAY HAD BEEN TO SMOKER PROFESSOR LINDA BOLD IS THAT RIGHT NO IT'S ALL CANCER RESEARCH U.K. WERE PRIMARILY IN LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE ON A WHOLE RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING THIS ONE AND TODAY IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE U.K. AND IN FACT INTERNATIONALLY WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY EVIDENCE COMING THROUGH THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXPERIMENT WITH ANY CIGARETTE MOSS YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO SO I JUST EXPERIMENTING GO ON TO EITHER REGULARLY SABI CIGARETTES AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AT THE MOMENT THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THEN BECOME SMOKERS
THE BASIS FOR THIS CHANGE ISN'T ISN'T SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND I ALSO THINK IT SENDS UNFORTUNATE MESSAGE TO SMOKERS BUT HE CIGARETTES ARE AS HARMFUL AS TOBACCO AND SHOULDN'T BE USED IN PUBLIC PLACES ON THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC CAN I SAY THAT THE LOOK CAN I JUST POINT THAT SIMILAR MESSAGE HAD BEEN SENT TO SOMETHING WE LISTEN TO ONE
THE FACT THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THE STRUCTURE TO BE IN DIFFERENT PLACES TO CIGARETTES AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN USE NORMAL CIGARETTES SO IT CAN YOU SEE SWEAT WHEN DOBSON WAS A NOT USED IT MAJORS THAT FLAT AND I THINK
THAT HIS APPROACH TO LOOK AT THAT IT IS A PROBLEM HIS EVIDENCE IS NOT THERE EITHER WAY AND THAT'S THE CONCERN WE HAVE THERE IS THE RISK THAT IS THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN THERE'S A RISK THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AND THE CONCERN IS LIKE THIS COULD TAKE PLACE IS THAT RIGHT PROFESSOR BALD THOUGH THE EVIDENCE ISN'T THERE I MEAN THERE'S THE BANNERS PROPOSED IS FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE IT COVERS QUITE A FEW OUTDOOR AREAS AS WELL
I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE EVIDENCE THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING I THINK THAT THE WELSH GOVERNMENT HASN'T REALLY BALANCED IS THAT WE ARE SEEING MANY THOUSANDS ARE SMOKERS NEW CASE SUCCESSFULLY STOPPING SMOKING USING THESE DEVICES AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH TO CONVEY THEIR RELATIVE COMPARED TO TOBACCO WE KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE U.K. AROUND TWENTY PERCENT OF ADULTS WHO ARE SMOKING NOW BELIEVE THAT YOUR CIGARETTES THAT ARE JUST AS HORRIBLE AS TOBACCO THAT'S NOT THE CASE GIVEN THE CURRENT EVIDENCE AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S NOT THAT HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE SOME SCALE OF HOW
THEY ARE COMPARED WITH CIGARETTES WELL THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF ESTIMATES BUT THERE ARE MANY MAGNITUDES LESS HARMFUL THAN YOUR CIGARETTE THEN CIGARETTES THEY HAVE TOXIC AND FROM THEM LIKE TOBACCO BUT THERE ARE FAR LOWER LEVELS THAN IN CIGARETTES AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY ACTUALLY MIMIC THE ACT OF SMOKING AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'RE APPEALING AND SO THE EVIDENCE TODAY WE ARE WATCHING A VERY CAREFULLY I WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TRACK IT AND BE CAUTIOUS BUT FOR SMOKING CESSATION THEY'RE DEFINITELY SHOWING PROMISE
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT DEEP CONCERN TO US WE WE RECOGNISE THAT THE POLICE HAD A SPREAD AND EVIDENCE AND WE WANT THE EVIDENCE TO COME FORWARD AND POP YOUR SCENE IS THAT AS THE TIME GOES ON WE WILL KEEP LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE AS WELL AND IF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL BE LOCKED OUT
AT THIS POINT IN TIME THERE IS CONFLICT THAN EVIDENCE THAT A BALD AS INDICATED THAT WHATEVER THAT IS OF COURSE THE INTERNATIONAL THAT'S IT O.K. BUT IT'S A GAMBLE IT'S A SITUATION WILL BE A PREVENTATIVE WE LOOK AT THAT THE IMPACT THEY COULD HAVE ON CHILDREN AND I'M SURE EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT WHAT WE WANT TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN DO NOT GO INTO SMOKE OF ANY TYPE AT ALL INDEED DAVID RACE LINDA PROFESSOR LINDA BALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF MARCH THE HEADLINES THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS EXPECTED TO OUTLINE BILLIONS OF POUNDS AND SPENDING CUTS IN HIS BUDGET BUT THERE'LL BE MONEY FOR EDUCATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS HOPING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP TO THE PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION MARKER RUBIO HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE THE LONDON AND FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGES HAVE AGREED THE TERMS OF A MERGER
AND THE WOMAN WHO CREATED ONE OF THE MOST FONDLY REMEMBERED CHILDREN'S T.V. CHARACTERS LADY PENELOPE AND THUNDERBIRDS SYLVIA ANDERSON HAS DIED
THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WILL UNVEIL HIS EIGHTH BUDGET TODAY WITH A PROMISE TO PUT THE NEXT GENERATION FIRST HE'LL ANNOUNCE AN INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR EDUCATION OF MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS OVER THIS PARLIAMENT WITH PLANS TO FORCE EVERY STATE SCHOOL IN ENGLAND TO BECOME AN ACADEMY AND HELP SOME EXTEND THEIR SCHOOL DAY THERE'LL BE INVESTMENT IN HOUSING AND TRANSPORT BUT MISTER OSBORNE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO CONFIRM AN EXTRA FOUR BILLION POUNDS IN SPENDING CUTS
IT'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH
FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE VOTERS' VERDICT AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE HER CHANCE TO BE BOLD BUT FOR GEORGE OSBORNE IT POSES PROBLEMS WHICH COULD MEAN A CAUTIOUS APPROACH ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS DIPPED TAX RECEIPTS ARE EXPECTED TO AND THE CHANCELLOR'S CONSTRAINED BY HIS OWN FISCAL RULES TO REDUCE DEBT AS A SHARE OF G.D.P. AND CONVERT THE DEFICIT TO SURPLUS BY THE END OF THE PARLIAMENT
MISTER OSBORNE WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS A REFORMER AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO CAN BALANCE THE BOOKS SO TODAY HE'LL OUTLINE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EDUCATION EVERY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND WILL HAVE TO BECOME AN ACADEMY FREE FROM LOCAL COUNCIL CONTROL BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND WILL BE ABLE TO BID FOR FUNDING TO EXTEND THE SCHOOL DAY WITH EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SPORT OR DRAMA
WITH THE ADDED HIS POLITICAL CHALLENGE OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE CHANCELLOR WILL AIM FOR ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY WITHOUT ALIENATING VOTERS OR THOSE IN HIS OWN PARTY
SLUGGISH GROWTH SINCE NOVEMBER'S AUTUMN STATEMENT MEANS THE CHANCELLOR HAS LESS ROOM TO MANOEUVRE IF HE'S TO MEET HIS SELF IMPOSED TARGET OF ACHIEVING A BUDGET SURPLUS BY THE END OF THIS PARLIAMENT OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COMMANDER AHMED ASSESSES THE MEASURES GEORGE OSBORNE COULD TAKE
TWO BIG NUMBERS MATTERED TO GEORGE OSBORNE IN THIS BUDGET THE AMOUNT THE GOVERNMENT BORROWED THIS YEAR THE DEFICIT AND THE TARGET OF A BUDGET SURPLUS OF TEN BILLION POUNDS BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ON BORROWING MANY BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT WILL MISS ITS TARGET OF SEVENTY THREE POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS AS THE U.K. ECONOMY HAS SLOWED TO REACH IT AND THE SURPLUS TARGET GEORGE OSBORNE WILL NEED TO ANNOUNCE SIGNIFICANT TAX INCREASES AND CUT PUBLIC SPENDING FURTHER
PAX WRITERS COULD INCLUDE A FUEL DUTY INCREASE HIGHER RATES OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAXES AND NEW BUSINESS TAXES PUBLIC SECTOR CUTS ARE LIKELY TO FALL ON UNPROTECTED DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE HOME OFFICE AND JUSTICE MY OSBORNE ALWAYS LIKES TO MIX IN A BIT OF PLEASURE WITH THE PAIN FOR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A TAX CUT
AS THE CHANCELLOR RAISES THE POINT AT WHICH WE START PAYING INCOME TAX AND THE LEVEL AT WHICH THE HIGHER FORTY P. RATE OF TAX KICKS IN THERE WILL ALSO BE MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING SUCH AS HIGH SPEED RAIL LINKS AS MISTER OSBORNE TRIES TO BUILD HIS WAY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS

SIX SAW OFF THE TRUMP CHALLENGE AND WON AN IMPRESSIVE VICTORY
TRUMP H.Q. THEY CHEERED THEIR MAN BUT IT WAS A LOW KEY PERFORMANCE FROM HIM
TWO WEEKS AGO AFTER SUPER TUESDAY MISTER TRUMP SPOKE AS THOUGH THE NOMINATION WAS SEWN UP LESS SO LAST NIGHT THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING PROCESS IT'S AN AMAZING PRIZE SO IT IS VERY DARK
BUT IT IS BY THE END IF YOU GET TO THE END YOU CAN HANDLE A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING PRESSURE THAT I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE IT WAS NOTHING LIKE IT AND WITH SENATOR TED CREW STILL IN SECOND PLACE THIS IS A FIGHT WHICH COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN JULY

CHOPPING AND TURNING OF THE ECONOMY IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE LONG TERM WHAT HAS BEAMED BEYOND SHORT TERM BAD ECONOMIC NEWS KATHERINE AROUND THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROBLEM WITH POLITICIANS AMBITIONS GEORGE OSBORNE'S BY NO MEANS THE ONLY PERSON TO HAVE SET OUT A GOAL AT THAT SAUCE AND ACTUALLY TURNING THEM INTO REALITY
ALSO I THINK IT'S YOUR RIGHT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED WITH SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO SIMULATE EXPORTS AND FAILING TO DO SO WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT NOW FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY YEARS AND I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM IS SO IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF
WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE WHAT WE MAKE IT HOW COMPLEX THAT THAT MIX OF IS BUT ALSO AS WE'VE REALLY GUESS WAS SAYING IT'S ABOUT ADVICE TO EXPORTERS WHO HAVE PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE SOLD ABROAD AND ENSURING THEY HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCE ISN'T IT ALSO THAT WE'RE JUST VERY GOOD AT MAKING THINGS THAT ARE NOT THINGS IN ANOTHER WHAT IF YOU JUST GO DOWN THE THAMES YOU CAN FIND WHAT BRITAIN IS GREAT AT EXPORTING BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES LEGAL SERVICES ADVICE TO MEDIA COMPANIES WERE RUBBISH ACTUALLY MAKING ANYTHING AT ALL
YES IS AND CERTAINLY SINCE THE RECESSION WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT SERVICE SECTOR JOBS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE SHOWING THE MOST GROWTH WHEREAS THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR HAS CONTINUED TO SHRINK AND THAT SEEMS TO BE A THEME WITH EVERY RECESSION THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR SHRINKS FOR LONGER DOESN'T RECOVER AS WELL AS THE SERVICE SECTOR SO THAT'S MEANT OVERALL THE BALANCE MORPH MORE SERVICES LESS MY HATCHERY HAMMER NICK I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WE ARE IMPORTANT NATION WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE FOR A LONG TIME BUT I THINK WE SHOULD NECESSARY KNOCK IMPORTS
THAT THE HIGH VOLUME OF IMPORTS WE HAVE COMING TO THE U.K. IS WHAT BRINGS A BIG SHIPS HERE THIS IS WHAT CONNECTS THE U.K. TO WHAT IS THE M. ONE OF WORLD TRADE BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE HIGH VOLUME OF IMPORTS WE COULD BECOME AN OFFSHOOT YEAH WE COULD BECOME A B. ROAD ON THAT THAT SORT OF HIGHWAY OF TRADE SO WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WE ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY AND FACILITIES LIKE THE GATEWAY ARE HERE TO ENSURE THE BIG SHIPS CAN CALLING TO BE HANDLED AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE
BY BRINGING THOSE IMPORTS IN THAT CREATES A NATURAL PIPELINE OF CONTAINERS I HAVE TO GO BACK TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE HERE EMPTY WHERE THEY DO LOOMING BUT WE CURRENTLY OUR BIGGEST EXPORT IS FRESH AIR BUT BUT BUT WHAT THAT DOES PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPORTED TO ACCESS THOSE CONTAINERS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE WE HAVE MINIS THAT WE'RE WITH PACKING INTO CONTAINERS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE GOING BACK EMPTY AND THEY'RE GOING BACK OUT TO SOUTH AMERICA ANOTHER OTHER NICHE MARKET I THINK
WHAT THE U.K. IS GOOD AT MADE IN BRITAIN DOES HAVE A VALUE AND WE ARE GOOD AT BUILDING VALUE ADDED PRODUCT YES I SAID WE WERE RUBBISH WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT RUBBISH AT MANUFACTURE THINGS ARE VERY GOOD AT MANUFACTURING SOMETHING BUT IT IS THAT WOULD MICHE ISN'T IT OFTEN GATHER AND VERY GOOD AT THAT HIGH END HIGH QUALITY MANUFACTURER GOOD GLOUCESTER MASS MANUFACTURE YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT SO WE DO CERTAIN THINGS VERY WELL SIR AEROSPACE AND MOTOR MANUFACTURING OBVIOUS EXAMPLES
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IN A WAY THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE JUST LIKE THE WEATHER THINGS THAT YOU IN BUSINESS HAVE TO TOLERATE THAT YOU WANT TO SAY THE ECONOMIST HAVE TO COMMENTATE ON OR DO YOU BELIEVE THE CHANCELLOR COULD BE A LOT MORE ACTIVE THAN HE IS CATHERINE IN GIVING SUPPORT TO EXPORTERS AND EXPANDING THOSE MARKETS
WELL I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THERE'S MORE THAT WE COULD BE DOING NOT NOT JUST FROM THE POINTY OF EXPORTING BUT JUST EVEN TAKING A STEP BACK TO HOW WE PRODUCE THE MIX OF THINGS THAT WERE MAKING AND THE FIRMS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO NURTURE IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE A VERY LES SAFER INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE MUCH MORE SUBJECT TO TO TO INTERNATIONAL SHIFTS AND CURRENCY SHIFT ANOTHER THINGS CAMERON THAT THAT THAT'S A LOT THAT'S VERY TRUE AND I THINK WE PROBABLY COULD MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR SMALLER EXPORTERS TO TWO X. WILL THINK ONE OF YOUR EARLIER
SPEAKERS WERE SAYING FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT'S ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE IS CREATING CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT AND HAVING THE RIGHT CAN WE HAVE A STRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT WE CAN ACCESS THOSE MARKETS OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD SAY THIS PORT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT AND WE CAN ALSO HELP IMPORTERS GET GOODS ON SHELVES MORE EFFICIENTLY WE CAN ALSO HELP EXPORTERS GET THINGS THAT WERE FISHERMEN CATHERINE ISN'T THIS INFRASTRUCTURE HERE AN ILLUSTRATION OF ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH POLITICIANS' RHETORIC THEY TALK ABOUT REBALANCING THE ECONOMY HERE WE ARE JUST A FEW MILES OUT OF THE CAPITAL A BILLION POUNDS IN PRIVATE MONEY
BACK IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND MONEY WHICH WOULD BE DESPERATELY WANTED ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO ATTRACT
YES THAT'S TRUE SO TRANSPORT INVESTMENT THIS YEAR THIS ONE ACTUALLY IS SAID TO BE FIVE TIMES HIGHER IN THE SOUTH EAST THAN IT IS IN THE NORTH AND AND THAT AND THAT JUST PERPETUATES THE GAP BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND WE WE NEED INVESTMENT IT'S NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT IT'S A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION INVESTING INSTRUCTED TO BRING UP PRODUCTIVITY IN THE NORTH AN EQUALISER NORTH AND SOUTH BUT PART OF THE PICTURE THIS PLACE CAPTAIN THORPE IS QUITE SIMPLE ISN'T IT TO SAY
THEY'RE ALL THESE CONSUMERS IN THE CAPITAL WHY NOT DELIVER THE GOODS CLOSER TO WHERE THEY ARE YET THERE'S TWO PAST WE'VE GOT TO RUN IT COMING WE'VE GOT EIGHTEEN MILLION CONSUMERS ON OUR DOORSTEP THE LARGEST MARKET BY DISPOSABLE INCOME IN EUROPE AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE HAVE A PORT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THAT MARKET WHICH ESSENTIALLY TAKING TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD IT'S REDUCING THE C.O.TWO FOOTPRINT OF TRANSPORT
BUT WE ALSO BETTER CONNECTED TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE U.K. AND THE NORTHERN PET WHAT ELSE THIS IS THE CLOSEST PORT TO THAT SO THE SHIPS THERE COME FROM ASIA I'M GOING TO THE NORTH THE U.K. THEY COME IN THROUGH THE CHANNEL IT WITH THE PORTS IN THE SOUTH ONE WORD EACH NERVY TODAY BEFORE THE BUDGET
THE LAUGH SUGGEST NERVY FROM GATHERING NUTS SO NERVY NICK NOT MYSELF BUT THERE WE ARE PERFECT BALANCE CAMERON THOUGHT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HERE AT THE GATE WHEN CATHERINE COALBROOK OF THE I. P. P. AH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S NINETY MINUTES PAST EIGHT WANT TO DELVE INTO WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT LATER OPEN A BIT MORE DETAIL I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR COME ON AHMED A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA CLEANS BUT A BUSINESS EDITOR SIMON JACK AND LAURA I'VE NOTICED YOU'VE BEEN TWEETING QUOTES FROM THE SPEECH HE WILL GIVE LATER WHAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT HIS OFFICE IS TRYING TO GET OUT NOW ABOUT
WHAT THIS BUDGET WILL BE I THINK LISTENERS MIGHT WONDER BY THE END OF THE DAY WHERE'S THE SUNSHINE CHANCELLOR WE'VE GOT RATHER USED TO THROUGH THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN HERE IN GEORGE OSBORNE TIME AND AGAIN SAME WE FIXED THE ROOF WHILE THE SUN WAS SHINING WE ARE HEADING OUT OF THE RED AND BACK INTO THE BLACK CHOOSING WHATEVER METAPHOR HE WANTED BUT TODAY THE METAPHORS
WILL FEEL VERY DIFFERENT HE'S GOING TO SAY OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG BUT THE STORM CLOUDS ARE GATHERING AGAIN OUR RESPONSE TO THIS NEW CHALLENGE IS A BUDGET WHERE WE ACT NOW AND WE DON'T PAY LATER SOME OF HIS OPPONENTS OF COURSE WOULD SAY SOME OF THE ISSUES HERE ARE SOME OF THE NERVES AROUND OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS OF COURSE GROWING FASTER THAN MOST AROUND THE WORLD
PROBLEMS IN PART OF HIS OWN CREATION THE TREASURY VERY MUCH SEE THIS AS A RESPONSE A STRONG RESPONSE FROM THE CHANCELLOR TO THE WOBBLES AROUND THE WORLD IN A FUNNY WAY YOU KNOW THIS MIGHT FEEL TONALLY RATHER LIKE A BUDGET FROM EARLY COALITION DAYS RATHER THAN WHAT WE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT IS BECAUSE SLOWER GROWTH WEAKER PUBLIC FINANCES SO WHAT WILL YOU BE LOOKING FOR TODAY
ABSOLUTELY WELL GEORGE OSBORNE HAS CERTAINLY PUT A LOT OF STORE BY HIS FAMOUS MAYBE FOR OURS BUT MAYBE NOT FOR THE GENERAL LISTENER HE'S FISCAL RULES THIS IS THIS NOTION THAT HE WILL HAVE A SET OF RULES THAT HE WILL HIT AND SHOW HIS ECONOMIC COMPETENCE BY DOING SO THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO THAT ONE WAS THE WELFARE CAP WHAT HE'S ALREADY MISSED THAT THIS SCHOOL RULE BECAUSE THE OF THE REVERSE ON THE TAX CREDIT CUTS WHICH IS ALREADY SO MISSED ONE PART OF THE FISCAL
THE SECOND WAS TO HAVE THIS NOTION OF OUR DEBT FALLING AS A SHARE OF THE NATION'S INCOME LOOKING NOW VERY LIKELY THAT YOU WILL ALSO MISS THAT TARGET AND THE THIRD ONE WHICH I THINK HE WILL TRY DESPERATELY TO HANG ON TO IS THE NOTION OF CREATING A BUDGET SURPLUS BY TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THAT IS LOOKING HARDER
BUT IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW WELL THE PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE PERFORMED THIS FINANCIAL YEAR ONE VERY INTERESTING POINT I THOUGHT MADE THIS MORNING I'D BE WERE UP LISTENING TO THE TODAY PROGRAMME AT SIX FIFTEEN MIKE AMY OR PIMPED HER ONE OF THE BIGGEST PURCHASERS OF GOVERNMENT DEBT SAID THAT ACTUALLY HE THOUGHT AUSTERITY HAD GONE FAR ENOUGH FROM ONE OF GEORGE OSBORNE'S BIG MESSAGES IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT MARKET REASSURANCE ABOUT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE INVEST IN BRITAIN ARE CONFIDENT THAT BRITAIN IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
LIKE AMY SAID THAT ACTUALLY A DEFICIT OF FOUR PER CENT WAS PERFECTLY REASONABLE ANY DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO GO MUCH FURTHER SO SLIGHTLY UNDERMINED THAT NOTION THAT THE CHANCELLOR CONSTANTLY PUSHES THAT HE NEEDS TO CUT MORE AND MORE AND MORE TO REASSURE THE MARKETS
AND SIMON JACK IF HE IS LOOKING FOR MONEY BUSINESS IS CLEARLY NERVOUS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TURN THAT HE'S GOING TO TURN TO THEM TO GET IT DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT TAKE HOME PAY SO IT WILL IT WILL FALL TO SOME EXTENT ON THE EMPLOYER AND THEY'RE FEELING PRETTY DUFFED UP BY THE CHANCELLOR IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE THEY HAD LIVING WAGE THAT I'VE HAD TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THE NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIPS LEVY THEY HAD INSURANCE TAX RATE ON THE INSURANCE COMPANY SO THEY'RE SAYING ENOUGH ALREADY GIVE US A BREAK BUT HE'S UNLIKELY TO OBLIGE
HE'S NOT GOING TO PUT UP THE BASIC RATES OF CORPORATION TAX BUT WHAT HE WILL DO IS TRY AND MAKE SURE LESS OF IT LEAKS OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO YOU MIGHT SEE FOR EXAMPLE A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH DEBT INTEREST YOU CAN DEDUCT FROM YOUR PROFITS WHEN PAYING TAX AND THE THING BUSINESS IS REALLY CARE ABOUT HIS RATES THEY'VE BEEN PROMISED THIS REVIEW WILL GET IT TODAY
THEY WANT TO KNOW THIS THE BIGGEST COST FOR MANY BUSINESSES WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP ME OUT IT'S A BIG MONEY SPINNER HE'S DEVOLVING SOME BUT TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES IS SCOPE FOR GIVING THEM MUCH FOR A BREAK ON THAT IS PRETTY LIMITED IS OFTEN USE THESE OCCASIONS TO TO BE A BIT OF A SHOWMAN AND YET EVERYBODY SORT OF SAYING IS THIS SHOULD BE MAKE IT SHOULD BE MILD ARE WE GOING TO DO WE NO
LAURA WELL I DON'T THINK THAT MEEK AND MILD OR WORDS THAT WILL PROBABLY BE USING BY THE END OF TODAY BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT GEORGE OSBORNE IS HE'S ALWAYS GOT THAT SLIGHT SENSE OF A GAMBLER YOU KNOW EVEN IF WE GO BACK TO TWO THOUSAND TED HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DEAL WITH THE DEFICIT YOU NEVER TOLD US HOW MUCH THE COURSE OF THAT ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THEN WHAM BAM HE SAID I'M GOING TO DEAL WITH THE DEFICIT I'M GOING TO GET RID OF IT ALL IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN OF COURSE HE FAILED
TO DO THAT TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE TAX CREDITS SHE WAS UNDER HUGE PRESSURE TO TWEAK THE PLANS OF THOSE CUTS THAT WE'RE GONNA HIT MILLIONS OF FAMILIES AROUND THE COUNTRY INSTEAD OF TWEAKS AND CUTS HE SAID I'M GOING TO GET RID OF THEM ALL HE DUMPED HIS PLAN COMPLETELY SO HE DOES HAVE THAT SORT OF ELEMENT OF THE FLOURISH ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE HEADLINE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SUGGEST BUT THIS VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE HERE BUT I'D BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE SURPRISES JUST A QUICK WORD FROM YOU LAURA ON
OF COURSE THE RESPONSE TO HIS TWEET SPEECH WHICH WE KNOW TODAY IS GOING TO BE GIVEN BY JEREMY CALLED MUCH AS SORT OF FIRST TIME HE'S DONE SOMETHING ON THAT MAGNITUDE AS WELL INDEED AND TRADITIONALLY I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST GIGS IN WESTMINSTER NOW IF YOU WERE THE OPPOSITION LEADER YOU'RE NOT THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR
CAN YOU IMAGINE DOING AN EXAM LIVE ON TELEVISION AND RADIO WITH SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PEOPLE SCREAMING AT YOU THE EXAMS NOT ON YOUR SPECIALIST SUBJECT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN GIVEN THE INFORMATION IN THE PRECEDING FEW MINUTES THAT IS PRETTY MUCH AS HARD AS IT GETS FOR OPPOSITION LEADERS EVEN THOSE WHO'VE BEEN IN THE JOB FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND EVEN THOSE YOU'VE GOT THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND THEM ON THE GREEN BENCHES BUT JEREMY CORBIN NEITHER OF THOSE FINAL TWO POINTS A TREE SO IT IS A TALL ORDER
AND A LOT OF LABOUR M.P.S ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT WE HAVE THE ANSWER WE WILL KNOW THE OUTCOME FROM TWELVE QUARTER PAST TWELVE TODAY AT LEAST THAT'S WHEN THESE SPECIAL BUDGET COVERAGE HERE ON RADIO FOUR STARTS WHEN MARTHA KEARNEY WILL BE PRESENTING THAT COME ON AHMED LAURA KINSBERG SIMON JACK THANK YOU

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AT THE LONDON GATEWAY IN THOROUGH CEREMONY IN CENTRAL LONDON AND AT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE SOME OF THE NEWS FROM CHRIS ALDRIDGE THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WILL ANNOUNCE AN EXTRA ONE AND A HALF BILLION POUNDS IN FUNDING FOR EDUCATION OVER THIS PARLIAMENT WHEN HE UNVEILS HIS EIGHTH BUDGET THIS AFTERNOON HE'S DUE TO SET OUT PLANS TO FORCE ALL STATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND TO CONVERT TO ACADEMIES THEIR FUNDING BOOST IS EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY AN ADDITIONAL FOUR BILLION POUNDS OF SPENDING CUTS
THE BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP HAS MOVED CLOSER TO SECURING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENCY AFTER WINNING SEVERAL STATE PRIMARY ELECTIONS INCLUDING THE KEY BATTLEGROUND OF FLORIDA BUT HE LOST IN OHIO TO THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR JOHN CASEY
THE LONDON AND FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGES HAVE AGREED THE TERMS OF A MERGER THE DEAL IS SAID TO BE WORTH TWENTY ONE BILLION POUNDS
BELGIUM'S NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WILL MEET LATER TO DISCUSS THE ONGOING SECURITY SITUATION IN BRUSSELS LINKED TO THE ATTACKS IN PARIS IN NOVEMBER YESTERDAY A MAN WAS SHOT DEAD AND FOUR POLICE OFFICERS WOUNDED WHEN POLICE RAIDED HER FLAT
SYLVIA ANDERSON THE CO CREATOR OF THUNDERBIRDS WHO GAVE HER VOICE TO THE WELL HEELED SECRET AGENT LADY PENELOPE HAS DIED SHE WAS EIGHTY EIGHT
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE FOR AS LONG AS ANYONE CAN REMEMBER THE SCHOOL DAY HAS ENDED AT ABOUT THREE THIRTY THAT WOULD CHANGE FOR MANY SCHOOLS AS A RESULT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET TODAY HE'S GIVING EXTRA MONEY SO THAT A QUARTER OF ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND CAN STAY OPEN AND A LONGER AND OFFER MORE EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES LIKE AND SPORT AND ART IS ALSO ENDING THE ONE HUNDRED YEAR OLD SYSTEM OF EL E.A.'S LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES RUNNING SCHOOLS
THE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO BECOME ACADEMIES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHETHER SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY LUCY POWELL IS HERE WITH ME IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING LET'S START WITH THIS LONGER SCHOOL DAY IS THAT A GOOD THING
MANY SCHOOLS VERY MANY SCHOOLS ALREADY OFFER EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITY THEY OFFER HOMEWORK CLUBS AND EXTRA TUTORING FOR FOR PEOPLE'S THAT NEED IT AND I WELCOME ANY MEASURE THAT OFF CONTINUES TO OFFER THOSE THINGS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE FACING AN EIGHT PERCENT CUT TO THEIR BUDGETS OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PARLIAMENT AND WHEN I SPEAK TO HER TEACHERS AS I DO EVERY WEEK THEY TELL ME THAT THE THINGS THEY'RE HAVING TO COOK FIRST
ARE THESE HOMEWORK CLUBS ARE THE ONE TO ONE TUTORING ARE THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ONE AND A HALF BILLION EXTRA WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT IS GOOD NEWS IT WON'T EVEN MEET THE CUTS THAT SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY HAVING TO MAKE IT'S THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES THAT SCHOOLS ARE FACING BUDGET CUTS AND THEY ARE REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT HEAD TEACHERS ARE FACING SO YES I WELCOME THIS MONEY YES I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOLS AND I THINK IT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO A QUARTER OF SCHOOLS WHO CAN BID FOR THIS MONEY
I THINK THE REALITY WE WILL SEE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS PARLIAMENT IS ACTUALLY PROVISION EXTRA CURRICULAR PROVISION AND TUTORING AND SO ON REDUCING NOT EXPANDING AND CAME ON THIS AS THE AT THE OTHER
ANNOUNCEMENT BEING MADE TODAY THAT ALL SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO BECOME ACADEMIES WITHIN THE NEXT SIX YEARS AND THIS IS I SUPPOSE THE BIGGER CHALLENGE REALLY FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS BECAUSE MAJORITY OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE NOW BECOME ACADEMIES ACADEMIES OF COURSE SOMETHING THE LABOUR INTRODUCED A YOU
ENCOURAGED PLEASED BY THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WELL AND I'M NOT BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE SALE ACADEMY ISATION OF ALL SCHOOLS AS IS BEING PROPOSED WILL DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE REALLY KEY ISSUES THAT FACE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM WITH TEACHER SHORTAGES ESPECIALLY IN THE KEY SUBJECTS OF ENGLISH MATHS AND SCIENCE
WE'VE GOT SCHOOL PLACES CRISES WHERE PARENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR KIDS INTO THEIR LOCAL GOOD SCHOOL WE'VE GOT A WIDENING ATTAINMENT GAP BETWEEN THE DISAPPEAR UNTIL ALL OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY COULD BE TACKLED BY ACADEMIES ACADEMIES FREE TO EMPLOY WHICHEVER TEACHERS THEY WANT AT WHATEVER RATES THEY WANT AND FREE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO
TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU'RE RAISING WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO EVIDENCE AT ALL AS THE EDUCATION SELECT COMMITTEE AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT ATTIC CARAMELISATION IN AND OF ITSELF LEADS TO SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT BUT THE CHALLENGES
FINDING GOOD QUALITY TEACHERS A BARBIE SETTING ALL SCHOOLS WHETHER THEY ARE ACADEMIES OR WHETHER THEY ARE LOCAL AUTHORITY SCHOOLS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS GOT ITS HEAD IN THE SAND ABOUT TEACHER SHORTAGES THANK YOU AND NOW I'M I'LL DISTRACT ACADEMIES BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD ACADEMIES THERE ARE SOME ACADEMIES THAT IT WHERE IT HASN'T WORKED BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE VERY GOOD SO ARE YOU OPPOSED TO THIS IDEA THAT ALL SCHOOLS END UP WITH THAT THAT EFFECTIVELY IT'S AN END TO THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITY
ACADEMY ISATION IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AS PART OF A WIDER STRATEGY FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT CAN HELP THOSE SCHOOLS AND IT HAS DONE IN SOME CASES BUT IN MANY OTHER CASES IT HAS IT HASN'T AS YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOW NON ACADEMIES WHO AREN'T ACADEMIES ARE PRIMARY SCHOOLS
EIGHT OUT OF TEN OF THOSE PRIMARY SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY GOOD OR OUTSTANDING A SCHOOLS A LOCAL AUTHORITY SCHOOLS SO IT'S A TIME WHEN WE ARE FACING HUGE FLOCKS WE'VE GOT NEW SATS COMING IN THIS YEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WOEFULLY MISHANDLING WE'VE GOT NEW G.C.S.E.S THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WAY BEHIND IN AGREEING THE EXAM SPECIFICATIONS FOR THOSE EXAMS
JUST AT THE TIME WHEN SEE EDUCATION SYSTEM FACING REAL CHALLENGES WE ARE ASKING HEADTEACHERS OF SMALL PRIMARY SCHOOLS LARGELY TO TAKE TIME AND MONEY OUT OF THAT VERY IMPORTANT JOB OF RAISING STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS TO CREATE THEMSELVES TO ACADEMY TRUST WHICH WILL TAKE A LOT OF MONEY LARGELY GOING TO LAWYERS THEY WILL HAVE TO FIND
MANY LAYPEOPLE EMBODY EVERYTHING ON ALL MONEY BEFORE THE ACADEMY ISATION I US AND THERE IS AND I'LL GET HIM AND ALL OF THEM AND AS THE L. E.A.'S HAVE SHRUNK BECAUSE MORE SCHOOLS HAD BECOME ACADEMIES THEY ARE LESS ABLE TO DO THE JOB OF RUNNING AND SUPPORTING SCHOOLS WELL THERE IS CAPACITY ISSUE ACROSS THE PIECE BOTH IN TERMS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND MANY OF THE ACADEMY CHAINS WE HAD A LETTER SENT ONLY LAST WEEK BY THE CHIEF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS MICHAEL WILSHAW TO NICKY MORGAN SAYING THERE WERE SERIOUS WEAKNESSES IN MANY OF THE ACADEMY CHAINS
CALLING FOR HER TO LOOK AGAIN AT MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS ROBUST OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE CAPACITY OR LEADERSHIP IN THE MULTI ACADEMY CHAINS AND ALSO TO GIVE MORE ECONOMY TO THE FRONT HE SAID IN HIS LETTER BEFORE ANY LOOKING AT THE NEXT WAVE OF THE CARAMELISATION SO ONLY A WEEK LATER WE'VE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT HASTILY BRINGING FORWARD THIS WHOLESALE ACADEMY ISATION OF SCHOOLS I THINK TO PROVIDE A FIG LEAF TO GEORGE OSBORNE'S
FAILED ECONOMIC CLANS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH THE REAL ISSUES FACING EDUCATION TODAY OH KAY ON ANOTHER MATTER WE ARE LEARNING OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT A LABOUR PARTY MEMBER HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR THE SECOND TIME BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS MADE ABOUT ANTI SEMITIC COMMENTS THAT SHE ALLEGEDLY POSTED ONLINE NOW
SHE WAS SUSPENDED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND RE APPOINTED
BEFORE JEREMY CORBIN KEPT BECAME LEADER BUT WE HAVE HEARD INCREASINGLY AS A RESULT OF COMMENTS MADE IN RECENT WEEKS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE LABOUR PARTY THAT IS NOT BEING DEALT WITH SUFFICIENTLY BY THE LEADERSHIP HAS THE ISSUE OF ANTI SENATORS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE SHADOW CABINET IT WAS DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY AT THE P. L. P. THIS WEEK AND JEREMY IN THE SHADOW CABINET IN AND IN THE SHADOW CABINET AND IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN SHADOW JEREMY CORBIN
AS WELL AS ALL OF US IN THE LABOUR PARTY HAVE MADE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THESE HAVE HORROR IN'T VIEWS WE WILL NOT TOLERATE ANTI SEMI SCHISM IN THE LABOUR PARTY OR OUTSIDE THE LABOUR PARTY AND WE ARE NOW THAT'S THAT WE WOULD REALLY ACTION AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT ACTION IS BEING TAKEN AND WE'VE ALSO GOT A WIDER REVIEW THAT IS BEING LED BY BARONESS JAN ROYLE
INTO HOW THE THESE ISSUES HAVE HAVE BECOME PART OF ASPECTS OF THE LABOUR PARTY IN SOME OF THE STUDENT UNIONS AND SOMEONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT WE WILL WE WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED IN ROOTING OUT ANY KIND OF ANTI SENATORS AND IN THE LABOUR PARTY IT WE WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT TOLERATE THIS AND JEREMY HAS MADE THAT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR LUCID THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME NOW IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE WELL IT WAS A VERY BIG NIGHT FOR THE RACE IN THE U.S. ELECTIONS TO BECOME THE TWO MAIN PARTIES AT CANDIDATE WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW A JOY TO SEE JIM JIM KNOTTY JIM YOU'VE OF COURSE BEEN FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT HAT WAS A LONG NIGHT AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE C. AND I'M NOT QUITE THE END OF THE STORY IN TERMS OF THE NOMINATIONS WHICH COURSE WILL BE DECIDED THAT THE TWO
CONVENTIONS IN JULY IN CLEVELAND AND PHILADELPHIA BUT THE MISTS OF THIS RACE AT CREATING VERY BIG WINS FOR DONALD TRUMP IN FLORIDA IN ILLINOIS NORTH CAROLINA JOHN CASE IT DID WIN IN HIS HOME STATE OF OHIO BUT IT IS NOW A FIGHT TO THE FINISH BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND SENATOR TED CREWS OF TEXAS FOR DELEGATES AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WITH THE TRUMP FORCES REALLY STILL HOLDING THE ADVANTAGE HE IS STILL THE MOST LIKELY NOMINEE NOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER ABOUT LAST NIGHT WAS THAT EVERYTHING
I HAD BEEN THROWN ATOM IN THESE RACES PARTICULARLY IN FLORIDA AND TRUMP HIMSELF TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY IN HIS SPEECH IN FLORIDA ONE OF HIS OWN RATHER GLITZY PROPERTIES THERE TO POINT OUT A SALIENT FACT THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF NEGATIVE ADVERTISING FROM OTHER REPUBLICANS HAD BEEN USED AGAINST THEM AND IT HADN'T WORKED
NOBODY HAS EVER EVER IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS RECEIVED THE KIND OF NEGATIVE ADVERTISING THAT I HAVE
RECORD RECORD RECORD HIM THE WAY LOYD MOSTLY FORCE WINS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WHAT ABOUT BABY
MOSTLY FALSE VICIOUS HORRIBLE
THEY SAY IT WAS EIGHTEEN MILLION THE FIRST WEEK MEANING LAST WEEK AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION IT ADDED UP TO OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU EXPLAINED IT TO ME BECAUSE I CAN'T MY NUMBERS WENT UP I DON'T UNDERSTAND NOBODY
WELL HE'S RIGHT THERE SAID A LOT OF OTHER REPUBLICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT EITHER SENATOR MARKER RUBIO WHOSE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL A WILTING FLOWER FOR SOME WEEKS NOW PULLED OUT AFTER HIS FLOP IN HIS HOME STATE OF FLORIDA NOWT SENATOR CREWS OF TEXAS STILL THINKS HE CAN OVERTAKE DONALD TRUMP
AND YOU CAN BET THAT SENATOR CREWS WILL INTENSIFY HIS ATTACKS HE'S ALREADY CALLED DONALD TRUMP VULGAR COARSE A MAN WHO SPEECHES YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO HEAR UNCONSTITUTIONAL A MAN WITH A CORRUPT RELATIONSHIP WITH BIG GOVERNMENT YOU NAME IT EXPECT MORE OF THAT IT'S NOT OVER CRUISE MAY HOPE HE CAN TAKE IT TO A DEADLOCKED CONVENTION THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY AND IMAGINE WHAT A MESS
THAT WOULD BE O.K. WHAT ABOUT HILARY CLIP WILL COME BACK TO HER IN A MINUTE O.K. BUT WHITBREAD FOR LEADING REPUBLICANS GIVEN THAT THEY ARE WITH THE LIKES OF MITT ROMNEY AND OTHERS HAVE SUCH DOUBTS ABOUT WHAT DO THEY DO IT WELL THEY'VE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE A SENATOR TED CRUISE THEY CAN'T STAND HIM EITHER IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVE EVERYTHING DRESSED UP IN EVANGELICAL LANGUAGE WHICH GOES DOWN VERY VERY WELL WITH BUT PART OF THE PARTY AND WHAT REMAINS OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT BUT IS ANATHEMA TO MANY OTHERS
AND THEY HAVE GOT A REAL DIFFICULTY HERE THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS A FIGHT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONVENTION TO GET SOMEBODY OTHER THAN TRUMP OR CRUISE END BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THAT WITH THE PARTY
TED CREW TO BE THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL CANDIDATES SINCE CALLED WATERMAN SIXTY FOUR TRUMP THEY THINK HE'S VERY VERY VULNERABLE FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AND THEY ARE DEEPLY WORRIED AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS O.K. SO LET'S TURN TO HILLARY CLINTON IS A GOOD NIGHT FOR THEM IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT BUT SO BERNIE SOUND AS THOUGH STILL IN THERE AND HIS CAMPAIGNING WHAT EFFECT IS IT HAVING ON HER WELL HE'S IN THERE MATHEMATICALLY SHE'S GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE NO ONE DOUBTS IT UNLESS THE SUM
SEX MAC ANOTHER COMES RUMBLING ONTO THE STAGE SHE WILL WIN THE NOMINATION SHE'S WELL AHEAD IN THE DELICATE CUT AT THERE ARE TWO THINGS ABOUT HIS CAMPAIGN ONE IT HAS ELECTRIFIED THE RACE AT THIS THAT THIS ARGUMENT FROM THE LEFT CRITICAL ABOUT WALL STREET AND SO ON AND IT HAS TAKEN HILLARY CLINTON TO PLACE WE'RE TALKING MUCH MORE FIERY LANGUAGE TO APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE WHO MOVED BY SANDRA'S THAT HAS BEEN
YOU WOULD SEE IN DEMOCRATIC TERMS GOOD FOR HER BECAUSE IT'S IT'S HEALED HER IN THIS
BUT HER WITNESSES HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPOSED YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HER CHARACTER THE UNTRUSTWORTHY NURSE A LOT OF AMERICANS ASSOCIATE WITH HER SHE'S GOT TO OVERCOME THAT LET'S BE HONEST MOST OF THE STUDENTS WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR BENNY SANDERS BUT THEY'RE GONNA VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP OR TED CRUISE SO SHE'S GOT SHE'S GOT A HUGE ADVANTAGE OVER ANY POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE LATINO AND BLACK COMMUNITIES NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT THERE ARE ISSUES AND KILL
THE LAST THING YOU HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THE EMAIL TRAIL SHE SET UP THIS PRIVATE SERVER WHICH HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE SHE'S ADMITTED IT WHEN SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE AT THE REPUBLICANS MAKE A GREAT THING ABOUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BEING ON THERE IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT THERE COULD BE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION WELL THERE IS ONE BUT IT COULD LEAD TO CHACHI IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT IN AN ELECTION YEAR TO POTENTIAL NOMINEE BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT IN THE MIX AND ONE LAST THOUGHT
THE REAL HARD LINE TED CREW SUPPORTERS ARE NOT RULING OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A THIRD PARTY CONSERVATIVE CANDIDACY IF THEY BELIEVE THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO GO DOWN IN FLAMES WILL SEE LOOK
WE CAN'T WIN THIS LET'S GO FOR A BELIEF BUT MY GOODNESS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT WHAT A FIREFIGHT JIM THANKS VERY MUCH

OF THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET SPEECH IS OF COURSE NOT JUST WHAT IMPACT IT HAS ON A BIG BUSINESS LIKE THIS BUT WHAT IMPACT IT HAS ON ORDINARY PEOPLE STEVE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NERVOUSLY PERHAPS WHEN YOU HEAR THE CHANCES GOT TO TIGHTEN OUR BELT YET AGAIN THE AGE OF AUSTERITY HAS TO GO ON
REALLY LOOKING FOR NOT TOO MUCH TO GO UP I'VE GOT A YOUNG CHILD SO INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO FOR CHILD CARE AND NEED MORE HELP REALLY HALF OF MY GIRLFRIEND'S WAGES GET SPENT ON CHILDCARE COS SHE WORKS FULL TIME AS WELL
SO REALLY INTERESTED TO TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WE WERE TALKING TO THE COUNCIL LEADER EARLIER ABOUT THE CUTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE HAVE MADE IN THE PAST IS THAT SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS YOU DO WORRY ABOUT CHILDCARE FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE YEAH YEAH OF COURSE IT DOES IT DOES WORRY US A LITTLE BIT YEAH
ARE YOU WITH THE CHARTS AND WHEN HE SAYS LOOK TOUGH TIMES I'VE GOT HER SO TIRED MY BELTER IS THERE A BIT OF YOU THINKING THIS IS ESTHER AND HE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE LIKE ME THERE TAKE THE BRUNT
YEAH OF COURSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE FEEL WHERE THE ONES THAT THEY TAKE THE POINT OF IT IN THAT AT THE HI ANDREW WHAT ABOUT YOU HERE YOU ARE A PLANNING LOTS OF THEIR MOVEMENTS HERE ARE YOU MUCH AFFECTED OR REASONABLY DECENT WAGE HERE CAN YOU RELAX AND JUST CARRY ON I WOULDN'T SAY I'M ON A DECENT WAGE WE KNOW WHATEVER DOES SHE MAYBE DONE THAT THREE YEARS AGO SO I'VE GOT SAVINGS FROM THE REDUNDANCY JOB SECURITY
SO HUGE FOR ME AND THAT THEY LONDON BUSTLE SO I LOVE IT HERE IT'S NICE WORKING BUT I'M PROBABLY OLD SCHOOL THAT AUSTERITY IS REALLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO STICK TO HIS CALL I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T YOU SHOULDN'T BE BOOM AND BUST YOU SHOULD BE PAYING FOR VETS NEED TO BE REDUCED THE SURPLUS NEEDS TO GO WE NEED TO GET INTO HER DEATH IT SITUATION WE'VE GOT A GOOD ECONOMY
TO START MAKING IT WORK AND PAYING OFF SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE OWE TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND DO YOU GET FRUSTRATED THAT THE CHANCELLOR EVERY YEAR SEEMS TO HAVE TO STAND UP IN A BUDGET AND SAY WELL NOT QUITE YET WE'RE NOT GONNA MEET OUR TARGET ONE DAY SOON
I DO I DO MAYBE LOWER BUDGETS ARE POLITICAL MOTIVATED THIS ONE I FEEL HE'S GOT THE TIME YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING WITH THE ECONOMY AND MAKE A STATEMENT TO PUSH OUR ECONOMY INTO BY THE SITUATION SO
I KNOW ONCE I DO IS EMMA YOUR KNOCK IT OFF YOU'VE GOT AN OFFICE JOB YOU'RE WELL PAID COMPARED WITH THESE GUYS SORRY TO RUB IT IN BUT IS IT A YOU FEEL YOU CAN RELAX IN A BUDGET OR DO YOU FEAR THAT HE MIGHT COME FOR YOU AS AN EASIER TARGET
FOR ME I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE THE DAY TO DAY COSTS I'D HAVE A FORTY FIVE
MILE ROUND TRIP TO WORK SO I'LL BE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF FUEL AND THINGS LIKE AIR PASSENGER DUTY AND BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO SOME AS COST TAX ON
FIZZY DRINKS AND THINGS THAT WOULD BE INTEREST TO SEE HOW THINGS CHANGE IN THAT ASPECT THIS IS ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CALL STEALTH TAXES SO MAYBE DOESN'T PUT UP THE RATES BUT LIKE AIR PASSENGER DUTY OR HIGHER TAX WERE TOLD OF INSURANCE IS QUITE LIKELY TODAY AS WELL
ABSOLUTELY AND SO I'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR THAT AND EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A SMALL CHANGE IN HER DAY TO DAY BASIS IT DOES MAKE AN IMPACT OVER THE YEAR WE WERE HEARING ANDREW THEY SAY STICK TO YOUR GUNS HE'S GOT A STICK TO THE COURSE DO YOU AGREE OR DO YOU THINK OFTEN THESE ARE EXCUSES FOR TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE ALREADY WORK VERY HARD AND PAY A LOT
I CAN I CAN SEE THE JUSTIFICATION I THINK THE MONEY HAS TO BE GENERATED FROM SOME SOMEWHERE
LET'S PUT IT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A TOUGH CHOICE WHERE THAT COMES FROM SO I DO THINK STICK AT IT AND WHEN YOU'RE HERE WITH THIS VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS DEPENDENT ON EXPORTS
DOES IT FEEL LIKE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BOOM HERE ANDREW OR IS THERE AN ANXIETY THAT WHAT THE CHILL WINDS WE'RE FEELING ARE ALSO A SYMBOL OF THOSE CHILL ECONOMIC WEBS WHICH MADE IT MUCH HARDER FOR EXPORT THEY'D HAVE BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WE'VE ALWAYS IMPORTING MORE THAN WE EXPORT
BUT THE EXPLOSIVE STILL STRONG READER LOVE CHEMICALS WE DO A LOT OF MACHINERY THAT'S O.K. THERE'S EMPTY CONTAINERS GOING UP WITH THAT'S REPOSITIONING YEAH LOVELY POSITION OF EXERCISE AND THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THAT'S WHAT JO THUS ECONOMY IS STRONG I FEEL I FEEL WE NEED TO START PAYING BACK AND
CUT IN THE PURSE STRINGS THAT IN SENSES A TEST NOT JUST OF THIS BUDGET BUT EVERY BUDGET THE BOSS HERE REMINDED HIS EARLIER THAT THE BIGGEST EXPORT FROM DOCKS LIKE THIS
IT'S FRESH AIR EMPTY CONTAINERS COS WE IMPORT SO MUCH MORE THAN WE EXPORT
AND THE TIME IS NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE WHEN THE HIGH RISE WAS FIRST DEVELOPED IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE FUTURE OF MASS HOUSING HAD ARRIVED THIS PARFAIT CLIP HAVE A GLASWEGIAN TOWER BLOCKS GRAND OPENING REMINDS US OF THAT NINETEEN SIXTIES OPTIMISM
OF ALL TIME DRAW HOMELESS PEOPLE DRAW MODERN NEW HOMES WHERE
MY BOTH GOTLAND
SIXTEEN YEARS ON MOVING DAY BUT
BUT IN THE DECADES THAT FOLLOWED AT THE TOWER BLOCK BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH POVERTY AND SOCIAL BREAKDOWN IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE NINETEEN DALE ESTATE IN HACKNEY DOWNS WAS ONE OF MANY BEING TORN
NO ON THE SHIP I WANT REALLY
I HAD A VERY NERVOUS BUT NERVOUS AND THE HANDSHAPE
I DID ACTUALLY PICK UP IF THEY HEAR WHEN IT'S GONE IT'S GONE I REALLY
IT'S BOTH
MY GOD WHAT YOUR CAMERA WITH YOU AND I LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT YEAH
PEOPLE GET USED TO ANYTHING THEY DON'T MEAN HE'S RIGHT THAT CLIP FROM THE LONDON METROPOLITAN ARCHIVES AND FILM LONDON SCREEN ARCHIVES BUT HIGH RISES AND NOW GOING UP AGAIN NOW THOUGH THE CONCRETE AND GLASS STRUCTURES REACHING SKYWARD IN CENTRAL LONDON UTTER HALS THE SUPER WEALTHY SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
THE FILM HIGH RISE OPENED IN CINEMAS THIS WEEK IT'S AN ADAPTATION OF J.G. BALLARD'S BOOK OF THE SAME NAME A DYSTOPIAN VISION OF A SMALL VERTICAL CITY WHICH DESCENDS FROM CIVILISATION TO SAVAGERY WE'RE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY CLARE JAMISON WHO IS A HISTORIAN HE WAS TRAINED AS AN ARCHITECT AND WE'RE JOINED NOW CAR OXFORD BY PETER FLANNERY
HE WAS THE CREATOR OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE NORTH THE PLAY AND AND OF COURSE THE LATER VERY FAMOUS VERY SUCCESSFUL B.B.C. TELEVISION SERIES ABOUT A GROUP OF FRIENDS FROM NEWCASTLE BOMB GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH HELLO GOOD MORNING CLARE JAMISON OR HIGH RISES EVER A GOOD THING
OH DIFFICULT QUESTION I MEAN I THINK THE ONE NEST UTOPIAN DREAM OF THE HIGH RISE FAILED BECAUSE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES CITY PLANNERS TOOK THOSE THOSE IDEALS ARE KIND OF LIVING AND IN FRESH AIR AND LIGHT KIND OF A MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL WAY OF LIVING AND THEY KIND OF STRIPPED THEM BACK THEY THEY WERE PURELY TO A KIND OF COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HOUSE PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY THEY BUILT CHEAPLY WITH PREFABRICATED CONCRETE PANELS AND THEY WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN THEY HAD VERY LITTLE SECURITY
THERE WAS NO KIND OF OFFICIAL SURVEILLANCE AND THERE WAS NO OTHER KIND OF NATURAL SURVEILLANCE GET ON THE STREETS SO IN THAT RESPECT THEY'RE KIND OF TYPOLOGY WAS STRIPS BACK OF KIND OF ITS ORIGINAL INTENTION AND I THINK THE KIND OF CONTEMPORARY HIGH RISES WE SEE NOW ARE VERY KIND OF
A DIFFERENT MODEL THEY ARE KIND OF SLICK A DEVELOPER'S DREAM OTHER SORT OF LIFE IN IN A FLAT WAY OF KIND OF SEALED FROM THE MESSY CHAOS OF THE CITY OF CARDIFF THERE'S A GLASS SCREEN BETWEEN YOU AND THE REST IN THE CITY AND HOME PETER DO YOU THINK OF THE COUNCIL HIGH RISES WERE MORE LIKE THE ONES GOING UP NOW THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SUCH PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM
WELL I THINK THIS HAD BEEN BETTER BUILT YES THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ALL THOSE PROBLEMS THEY STARTED FALLING APART ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY WENT UP WHEN RONAN POINT PARTIALLY COLLAPSED I THINK WHICH WAS NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THEM BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT REVEALED WAS THAT THAT PREFABRICATED BUILDING SYSTEM WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN CHUCKED UP WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH WASN'T WASN'T ADEQUATE AND THEY HADN'T SPENT ENOUGH MONEY ON IT AND IT WASN'T JUST
THE BUILDING MATERIALS ON THE DESIGN WAS THAT GOVERNMENT WAS VERY RELUCTANT IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES TO RELEASE ENOUGH LAND FOR FOUR HIGH DENSITY HOUSING ACCEPT
AND THAT UNLESS PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO BUILD UPWARDS AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS STARTED I THINK I'M GAY BUT DO YOU I MEAN WERE THEY ALWAYS A BAD THING IS THAT THIS IDEA OF CREATING A KNOW THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT'S ALWAYS A BAD BAD THING IF THAT IF THAT IF THEY'RE PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THEM REALLY BUT THEY WERE USELESS FOR FAMILIES WITH LITTLE KIDS IN WINDSWEPT
WINTERY LANDSCAPES LIKE MANCHESTER AND SHEFFIELD LOOK GREAT ON THE PLANS AND I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I SAW HUMOUR BECAUSE I WENT I WENT TO LIVE IN MANCHESTER AS A STUDENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND I SAW THE HUME FLATS FOR THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT THEY LOOK FANTASTIC YOU KNOW THE SUN WAS SHINING AND I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE BARCELONA OR SOMETHING BUT THE TROUBLE IS IT'S NOT POT FROM HOPE NOW AND ONCE ONCE THEY ALL TURNED GREY AND STARTS STREAKING WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH RAIN
WHEN THEY START TO LOOK WINDSWEPT AND THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THE KIDS PROPERTY TO PLAY PEOPLE LOST FAITH IN THEM AND CUP AND CRUCIALLY COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN DISRUPTED AND IN SOME CASES ABSOLUTELY DISBURSED WHILE THAT WITHOUT THEIR OLD HOMES NOT DOWN WHILE THE NEW ONES WERE BEING BUILT AND THEN NO ATTEMPT REALLY TO BRING THE COMMUNITIES BACK TOGETHER AGAIN WHEN THEY DID THAT IN PLACES LIKE BYKER IN NEWCASTLE IN THE LATE SIXTEEN SEVENTIES IT WORKED VERY WELL
THAT PRESUMABLY CLAIRE JAMES AND IS THE CRITICAL THING THAT ACTUALLY ARCHITECTS HAVE LEARNT IS THIS IDEA OF ENSURING THAT THERE IS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY EM I MEAN I THINK THEY'VE THEY'VE TRIED TO LEARN THAT BUT I MEAN
I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IT COMES DOWN TO IS IS CHOOSING TO LIVE IN THESE PLACES RATHER THAN BEING KIND OF FORCE THAT IN YOUR ONLY OPTION I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE TRELLICK TOWER GOT GOLDFINGER'S TRELLICK TOWER WAS NOTORIOUS FOR BEING A VERY ANTI SOCIAL PLACE AND NOT VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE UNTIL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE COUNCIL CAN I CHANGE THE RULES AND SAID ONLY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE HERE AND LIVE HERE
AND THAT STARTED THIS TRANSFORMATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMUNITY LIVING THERE PEOPLE PEOPLE HE WERE YOU KNOW HAD A PASSION FOR THAT BUILDING AND HE WANTED TO KNOW IF I'VE CHANGED SORT OF COMMUNITY AND VERY GRADUALLY THE TRELLICK TOWER SINCE THEN HAS BECOME A HIGHLY DESIRABLE PLACE TO LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE AND WE KNOW IT NOW AND PETER VARNEY THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE WITH ALL THESE NEW STRUCTURES THAT ARE GOING UP SO MANY NEW VERY TALL BUILDINGS
YES BUT I KNOW WHO IS GOING TO LIVE IN THEM THAT'S THE THING THAT THAT PRESUMABLY THEREFORE RIP THERE FOR WELL OFF PEOPLE AND THEY WERE PROBABLY AUTOMATICALLY BE DE MAINTAINED IN IN GOOD ORDER AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE PRESUMABLY OR SOME PEOPLE HAVE THEM THEY WON'T HAVE
THE SAME NEEDS IN THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THE FAMILIES WHO WERE DUMPED IN THE IN THE CONCRETE DUST BINS IN THE SIXTIES AND PRESUMABLY POOR PEOPLE WITH SMALL SMALL CHILDREN AND PRESUMABLY THEY WON'T HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT J.G. BALLARD'S HIGH RICED HERE IT DOES LOOK A BIT OF A NIGHTMARE THAN THAT PETER FLANNERY CLARE JAMESON THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
SARAH TODAY YOU COULD BE FORGIVEN IF YOU WITH THE CHANCELLOR FOR WISHING YOU COULD STAY IN BED BUT NO CHANCELLOR GETS TO MAKE A CHOICE AS TO WHETHER HE DELIVERS A BUDGET SPEECH THE NUMBERS HAVE TO BE DECLARED BUT BAD NEWS HAS TO BE REVEALED AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TOLD TO EXPECT TODAY A REMINDER REALLY THAT ONCE AGAIN THE NUMBERS ARE NOT ON COURSE TO CUT THE DEFICIT
TO CUT THE DEBT AT THE SPEED WITH WHICH GEORGE OSBORNE HAD ORIGINALLY HOPED WILL GET NEWS TOO OF COURSE OF WHO MIGHT HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE SPENDING WILL BE SQUEEZED ONCE AGAIN
TAXES WE EXPECT TO RISE BUT BE HERE ON THE DOCKSIDE ON THE LONDON THAMES IS A REMINDER OF WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN THE END WILL THE BRITISH ECONOMY BE GOT GOING AGAIN WE EXPORT MORE THAT WE IMPORT CAN BRITAIN BE MADE TO BOOMER GOOD MORNING
