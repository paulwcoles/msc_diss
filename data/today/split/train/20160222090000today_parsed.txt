HAS AS ITS HEADLINE YOU OF COURSE AS IN THE VIEW THE SUN BLONDE BOMBSHELL CAMERON ROCKED AS JOHNSON THE HEADS OF BACKS BREAKS IT RATHER FROM THE E.U. BORIS TOLD HIM BY TEXT JUST NINE MINUTES BEFORE GOING PUBLIC THEY SAY TOLD HIM OF COURSE
DAVID CAMERA OUT FOR HIMSELF THAT'S THE HEADLINE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT BORIS JOHNSON'S GAMBLED HIS LONG STANDING AMBITION TO BECOME BRITAIN'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER ON WINNING THE REFERENDUM AND PULL THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE LOOP BEEN UNION BY BECOMING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TORY TO DECLARE IN FAVOUR OF BRECHT'S THE GUARDIAN NICHOLAS WHAT ARE SAYING
CAMERAS BATTLED TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE HIT ITS MOST SERIOUS POLITICAL OBSTACLE YET BEN WHEN JOHNSON ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY THAT AFTER A HUGE AMOUNT OF HEARTACHE HE WAS THROW HIS WEIGHT BEHIND THE LEAD CAMPAIGN IN A SIGN OF A NEAR COLLAPSE IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PAIR THE LONDON MAYOR SENT A TEXT THE PRIME MINISTER FOR FORTY P. M. TO TELL HIM OF HIS PLANS MINUTES BEFORE EXPLAINING HIS AGONISINGLY DIFFICULT DECISION
THE MAIL FROM BOW DEADLINE BUT BORIS GOES IN FOR THE KILL IT'S ON TOP OF A RATHER STRIKING PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MAYOR OF LONDON WITH HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED ALL HE'S MISSING IS THE NECK OF THE PRIME MINISTER THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT OUGHT TO BE IN BETWEEN THAT'S CLEARLY HEALTHY MALE HE'S THE TELEGRAPH OF COURSE ARE ABLE TO HAIL THEIR OWN COLLAR BEST SO THEY HAVE A HOLLER CHURCHILLIAN POSE WITH BORIS JOHNSON WAVING IN FRONT OF THE UNION JACK A PICTURE TAKEN FROM I THINK THE LAST CONSERVATIVE CONFERENCE WITH A QUOTE FROM HIS COLUMN FOR THE PAPER
THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME CHANCE TO VOTE FOR A REAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN'S RELATIONS WITH EUROPE THE SUN REVEALS QUITE HOW THE EUROSCEPTIC PAPERS GOING TO TREAT THE PRIME MINISTER A PICTURE OF DAVID CAMERON WITH AN EXTREMELY LONG NOSE PINNOCHIO EXCEPT YOU WHO IS THE LAST SYLLABLE OF THAT KNOCK YOU CAMERON DEFIANT BUT A EUROPE CLAIMS REALLY TRUE AND IT GOES THROUGH FOUR OF WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS PORKY
ONLY ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS OF THIS POOL HE SAYS WITH DIDN'T FOR IT'S JUST COMING UP TO TEN PAST SIX
THERE IS A REAL WORLD OUT THERE AS WELL MORE GRIM NEWS I'M AFRAID FROM THAT FROM SYRIA IN PARTICULAR AS A WAVE OR BOMBS HIT THE CITIES OF HOMES AND DAMASCUS STYLING SIGNAL ALL THE TALK ALL HOPE MAYBE HAVE BOTH CEASEFIRES AND PEACE TALKS LENA SIN JAB OUR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT JOINS IS ON THE LINE FROM BEIRUT'S LENA GOOD MORNING TO YOU TELL US THE NEWS FROM THE CITY
WITH MORNING REALLY TERRIBLE NEWS COMING FROM THEIR HOMES AND IN THE SUBURB OF THE MASK HAS AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY KILLED AFTER
SEVERAL CAR BOMBS THAT HIT THE TWO PARTS ALTHOUGH THESE TWO PARTS IN HUMS ENDING AT THE MASK AS OUR HEAVILY SECURED BY THE GOVERNMENT HOWEVER THERE IS A SECURITY BREACH
FOR THESE A BLAST TO TAKE PLACE JUST AT THE TIME WHERE A PROVISIONAL AGREEMENT DOES BEING A REACHED WITH RUSSIA ON A PARTIAL TRAWLS AND ACCORDING TO U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
IT IS VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE HORROR DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO CALIBRATE IT REALLY IS THIS JUST ANOTHER GRIM DAY OR ARE THINGS GETTING WORSE
WELL AFFORD FOR THE OPPOSITION IT'S A DAY IN THE AND HOLDS A GRIM DAY WITH GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED BY A RUSSIAN WARPLANES NON STOP OVER THE PAST YEAR
BUT THIS THESE TWO AREAS ARE SECURED GOVERNMENT PRO GOVERNMENT AREAS IN SEE THERE'S IN A BIN THE MASK IT'S A PREDOMINANTLY SHI'ITE AREA
IN HUMS IT'S A PREDOMINANTLY ALLY THERE SO IT'S THE HEART OF LOYALIST TO PRESENT A SHOWER I SAID THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH ATTACKS AN INFILTRATION FROM THE SELF PROCLAIMED ISLAMIC STATE IF IT'S IN HE'S CONNED CONFIRMED THAT THEY ARE THE ONES BEHIND IT WOULD TAKE PLACE AT A TIME WHERE THE CEASEFIRE
IS ABOUT TO BE REACHED MANY PEOPLE YOU TALK TO INSIDE SYRIA RAISE AN EYEBROW ABOUT WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE ATTACKS AND EVEN LOYALIST TO PRESENT THE SHOW AS I'VE HAVE PROTESTED IN HUMS AGAINST THE GOVERNOR AS SECURITY OFFICIALS BLAMING THEM FOR THE ATTACKS AND YET YOU KNOW THE PLACES PRISONER'S HANDS FORCES ARE STILL MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE RUSSIANS
ONLY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE RUSSIANS IN FACT IN THE RUSSIANS GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE PRESENT HE WASN'T ABLE TO CONTROL HER WITH HIS TROOPS AND MANY PEOPLE ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE ARMY THAT'S WHY WE SEE A WAVE OF YOUNG MEN FLEEING CEREAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY
RUSSIA IS ON WARDS AND TO USING ITS WARPLANES AND DOING THE JOB FOR US THAT THE INNOCENTS IN GENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THEY'RE ABOUT TO START GETTING RID OF THE SO CALLED JUNGLE CAMP THAT HAS BEEN HOME TO SO MANY MIGRANTS IN CALAIS A CORRESPONDENT TOM AFFAIRS HE IS IN CALAIS THEY GONNA START DEMOLISHING IT ON WEDNESDAY
YES EXACTLY THE AUTHORITIES HERE ARE ADAMANT THERE YOU GOING TO START CLEARING SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CAMP ON WEDNESDAY MORNING WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THEY AREN'T THEY HAD GIVEN A DEADLINE TO AT THE MIGRANTS LIVING IN THAT PART OF THE CAMP THEY HAD GIVEN THEM ONE WEEK
AND A DEADLINE OF TOMORROW EIGHT O'CLOCK P.M. BUT THEY'VE NOTICED THAT THE MAJORITY OF MIGRANTS LIVING IN THAT SOUTHERN HALF REMAIN THERE THEY HAD GIVEN THEM TWO OPTIONS EITHER TO RELOCATE TO A NEWLY BUILT SORT OF CONTENT OR VILLAGE OF SMALL CONTAINERS SHIPPING CONVERTED CONTAINERS
OR TO RELOCATE TO RECEPTION CENTRES SOMEWHERE ELSE IN FRANCE AND THEY NOW SEEING THAT MOST OF THE MIGRANTS ARE STAYING THERE AND SO YESTERDAY THEY'VE CONFIRMED THAT HE WILL GO AHEAD ON WEDNESDAY THEY WILL TELL THE PEOPLE TO MOVE
THEY DID SAY THAT THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING TO AVOID THE USE OF FORCE BITS AND THAT THE CLEARANCE AND MAY ACTUALLY TAKE UP TO ONE MONTH SO THEY WANT TO DO THAT SORT OF PEACEFULLY BUT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW THEY WILL NOT ENCOUNTER ANY KIND OF RESISTANCE RIGHT BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION OF GETTING RID OF THE WHOLE
SO I THINK THAT IS THE MEAT TERM LONG TERM PROJECTS OF THE AUTHORITIES THEY HAVE SAID ENOUGH OF THIS CAMP WE DON'T WANT THESE CAMP ANY MORE WHAT THEY WANT ACTUALLY IS TO HAVE A NUMBER OF MIGRANTS IN HER DESIGN ARE REDUCED TO TWO THOUSAND MAXIMUM AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE
BUILD THAT SORT OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF SHIPPING CONTAINERS TO RELOCATE FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE MIGRANTS THEIR WOMEN AND CHILDREN SENSE THEY CAN HOST ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT NOT MORE IN THE LONG TERM SO THEY ARE STARTING WITH THE SOUTHERN HALF BUT IN THE MONTHS TO COME THEY WANT TO CLEAR THE WHOLE CAMP
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS A QUARTER PAST SIX AS YOU KNOW THE STARTING GUN HAS BEEN FIRED ON THE E.U. REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN BUSINESS OF COURSE A CRUCIAL CONSTITUENT IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THAT AND SIMON JACK IS HERE TO TELL US MORE YET IT SEEMS NICK THAT THEY'RE JUST AS DIVIDED AS OTHER GROUPS JUST AS POLITICIANS ARE TAKING THEIR SIDE SO OUR BUSINESSES WE SHOULD SAY OF COURSE IS THAT BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE A VOTE BUT I SAY THEY DO HAVE A POWERFUL VOICE STRONG OPINIONS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE AMONG THE LEADERS
I HAVE TO HAVE THEM WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO FIRST JOHN MILLS FOUNDER OF HOME SHOPPING FIRM GEMMELL AND DEPUTY CHAIR OF VOTE LEAVE AND SOME MIGHT RAKE CHAIRMAN OF B.T. A CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WILL BE SIGNING A LETTER BACKING DAVID CAMERON'S CAMPAIGN TO KEEP THE U.K. IN A REFORMED EUROPE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH FIRST JOHN MILLS WHY ARE YOU SO KEEN TO LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN BUSINESSES DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY
NO THEY DON'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY BUT THEY DO LIKE OPPORTUNITIES AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE OUTSIDE THE E.U. THERE'LL BE JUST MANY UP OPPORTUNITIES IF NOT MORE THAN WE'VE GOT NOW I THINK WE DO COME OUT THE CHANCES OF US NOT HAVING A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EUROPE ARE VERY VERY LOW THEY'VE GOT A HUGE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SURPLUS
THEY SO FAR MORE TO US THAN WE DO TODAY UM IT'S ON THAT THEY SELL MORE TO US THAN WE SELL TO THEM THAT'S A BIT OF A FUNNY ONE ISN'T IT BECAUSE BASICALLY FORTY PERCENT OF OUR EXPORTS GO TO THE E.U. ON AVERAGE SIX PER CENT OF EXPORTS GO FROM EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BY COUNTRY BY COUNTRY TO THE U.K. SO THAT DOESN'T QUITE WORK THAT ALLERGY WELL YOU SAY THAT BUT THE FACT IS THAT THEY SELL ABOUT SIXTY BILLION POUNDS MORE
GOODS AND SERVICES TO US EVERY YEAR THAT WE SELL TO THEM AND THE CHANCES OF THEM THEREFORE JUST WALKING AWAY FROM A MARKET OF THAT SIZE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY LOW OH KAY AND NO ONE DOUBTS THAT WE WOULDN'T STOP BEING THAT THERE WERE THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY OVER NIGHT BUT THE ONE THING THAT DRIVES MOST PEOPLE IN THIS DEBATE OR MANY PEOPLE THIS DEBATE IS IMMIGRATION
WHY DOES THAT LEAVE BUSINESS IS COS IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH THE BUSINESS IS WHY WOULD BUSINESSES WANT TO LIMIT THEIR ACCESS TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE LABOUR POOL I THINK BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY LIKE IMMIGRATION BECAUSE IT PROVIDES HIM WITH A POOL OF VERY COMPLIANT LOW PAID LABOUR WHERE THEY WANT SO LET'S BE CLEAR ON THAT ON THAT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES FOR PEOPLE ON THIS DEBATE YOU'RE SAYING THAT BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY ON DIFFERENT SIDE TO MUCH OF THE PUBLIC WELL SOME BUSINESSES BUT A LOT OF BUSINESS
BUSINESS FOR BRITAIN WHICH CO CHAIRMAN OPTED A VERY THOROUGH SURVEY MUCH MORE THOROUGHFARE MAY SAY SEVEN THE C.B.I. WHICH WILL BORE IMPRESSIONISTIC WILL TALK TO SEE DIANA MOMENT I SUPPOSE DO WHAT BUSINESS REALLY THOUGHT INTERESTING LIMB MORE THAN I THOUGHT THE SINGLE MARK WAS MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH BUT THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING
AND ON THE WHOLE BUSINESSES WERE FAIRLY EVENLY DIVIDED RIGHT ACROSS THE PIECE DO YOU KNOW NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF BUSINESSES IN THIS COUNTRY DON'T DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AT ALL BUT THEY STUCK WITH THE REGULATIONS AND THINGS THAT COMES ACROSS AND THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY KEEN ON ON ON STAYING IN O.K. LET'S GET THE RAKE THIS LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN BUSINESS LEADERS HE BACK YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A MORE POSITIVE MESSAGE IN THAT WELL I THINK THERE WAS AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE MESSAGE THE HISTORY DIDN'T DO HIS SHOWS THAT
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROW WE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN EMPLOYMENT WE'VE BENEFITED PRINT AVAILABILITY OF SKILL MIGRANT WORKERS WHERE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE SKILLS BUT THE DEMOCRATS AGAINST US THERE'S NO BETTER EXAMPLE THE CAR INDUSTRY WILL BE DON'T HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS
HUGE INVESTMENT FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF ALL PRODUCTION GOING OUTSIDE THE U.K. SIGNIFICANT RECENT INCREASE MAINLY GOING TO RECOVERING EUROZONE THERE ARE MASSIVE BENEFITS FOR UNIVERSITIES RESEARCH TO GRANTS TO THE CITY OF LONDON YOU KNOW IT'S ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT TO BE THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL OF A MAJOR BLOCK TO BE ABLE TO TRADE RIGHT ACROSS EUROPE AND FOR ALL OF US TO BENEFIT FROM THESE TREATIES THAT THE E.U. HAS RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD INCLUDING POTENTIALLY MAJOR ONE WITH THE UNITED STATES
WHOSE TRADE REPRESENTATIVE IS ALREADY SAID HE WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN DOING A DEAL WITH THE U.K. ON ITS OWN ON THE CITY QUESTION YOU WERE THERE WAS A BIT OF FEAR THAT BASICALLY OVER TIME THE E.C. BE THEY'D THE EUROZONE MEMBERS WOULD GANG UP AGAINST THE U.K. OUTVOTE THEM ON SOME BIG ISSUES WHEN IT CAME TO FIGHTS REGULATION DID THE DEAL DO ENOUGH TO ASSUAGE YOUR FEARS ON THAT FRONT YES AND I THINK LET'S BE CLEAR THIS IS A TWO ARE YOU SURE I THINK THE EUROZONE COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING IN THE NON EUROZONE COUNTRIES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT
AND VICE VERSA AND IT'S BOTH OF OUR INTERESTS TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE NEED BOTH OF US TO SUCCEED THE EUROZONE AND THE NON EUROZONE AREAS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SOMETHING THAT HELENA MORRISSEY ON THE OUT SIDE HAS POINTED OUT SAYING THAT LOOK ICELAND IT'S GOT INDEPENDENT TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA AND INDIAN IT'S GOT A POPULATION THE SIZE OF CROYDON THE U.K. WOULD EASILY BE ABLE TO DO THIS LOOK
OF COURSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF TRADE DEAL BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT SORT OF TRADE DEAL IT WOULD BE IF WE WANT TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET IT IS ABSOLUTELY MADE CLEAR AND IT IS THE CASE FOR OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE IT YOU MUST COMPLY WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU MUST ALSO IN THE CASE OF NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND COMPLY WITH FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR IF YOU WANT THE FULL
DISCOUNT IF YOU WANT FULL ACCESS AND FOR ECONOMY A SIZE I CANNOT SEE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE US A BREAK ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THE REST OF THE SINGLE MARKET IT ISN'T THAT THE CASE JOHN MILLS THAT TO EAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'D HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND AS A BUSINESS THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS IN FACT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THEY WERE YOU KNOW THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THE YOU TO BE NICE TO US POST AFTER LEAVING IN CASE ANYONE ELSE GOT THE SAME IDEA
WELL YOU DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE CENTRAL MARKET TO TRADE WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT HAVE FULL ACCESS AS MIGHT BREAK WAS SAYING THAT WHAT'S FOR ACCESS MAIN YOU COULD SELL TO THEM AS AS MUCH YOU LIKE CHINA AMERICA ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES SELL VAST QUANTITIES OF GOODS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SINGLE MARKET WE SELL LOADS OF GOODS TO NORTH AMERICA WERE NOT PART OF THE UNITED STATES IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUES TO WHETHER YOU CAN TRADE
OR WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE SINGLE MARKET YOU CAN TRY PERFECTLY WELL WITHOUT BEING IN A SINGLE MY JUST CLARIFY THAT MIGHT NO I MEAN I THINK WITH DUE RESPECT SLIGHTLY MISSING THE POINT THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET AND YOU WANT TO HAVE THE TARIFF FREE SORT OF AXIS YOU HAT WITHOUT DUTIES BEING IMPOSED YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES OF THE SINGLE MARKET OTHERWISE THE SINGLE MARKET DOESN'T WORK IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE IT YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE THOSE RULES TO MAKE THEM PRAGMATIC AND SENSIBLE
O.K. WELL I DON'T THINK EVEN THAT'S THE CASE I MEAN IT WE HAVE OUR EITHER EIGHT PERCENT OR TWELVE PERCENT OF THE VOTES WENT A LOT OF THE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN ABOUT THIS MOST OF THE TIME DOES CONSENSUS ABOUT STANDARDS AND SO FORTH ANYWAY
BUT WHERE WE'VE DISAGREED I THINK BY BRIGHTON SAYING THAT SUMP SEVENTY CASES WE'VE STOOD OUT AGAINST THE OPPOSITION THEN OR OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WE HAVE BEEN DAD VOTED EVERY TIME SO THE IDEA THAT WE CAN AND US IN A VERY STRONG POSITION TO INFLUENCE WHAT'S GOING ON ISN'T IS IS NOT TRUE DID DAVID CAMERON STEELE TO ANYTHING TO DO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON YOUR
ATTITUDE TO THIS DEBATE ONE BIT YES I THINK HE DID I THINK HE HE GOT NICKY GOT CLOSE AND I WON'T BE A BUILDER YOU'VE GOT CLOSE BUT I THINK HE GOT A BIT A BETTER DEAL THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE IF YOU'D GONE ALONG WITH WHAT WAS ON OFFER A WEEK OR SO AGO O. K. JOHN MILLS SIR MIGHT WRECK THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED NOW LET'S WHO'D BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE SEPIA DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE C.B.I. CAROLYN FAIRBURN WHO IS WITH US HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PLAY THIS ONE IT COULD BE YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS A DIVIDED HOW DOES THE C.B.I. PLAY THIS ONE
FIRST OF ALL GOOD MORNING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING NOW NOW THE STARTING GUN HAS BEEN FIRED IS THAT WE HAVE AN INFORMED DEBATE I KNOW WHAT THE PUBLIC ARE SAYING IS THEY WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE IMPACT IS OF THIS DECISION ON JOBS AND GROWTH AND PROSPERITY IF SHE'S AROUND SEVENTEEN IMMIGRATION MATTER A GREAT DEAL BUT SO DO JOBS JOBS TODAY AND JOBS FOR THE PEOPLE'S CHILDREN
SO THE JOB OF THE C.B.I. AND MAKE MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT VOICE GETS HEARD BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ORGANISATIONS BETTER PLACED TO INFORM THAT DECISION THAN THE MANY BUSINESSES IN OUR COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THEM IN DEPTH FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WHAT OF APPROX FRUSTRATIONS THAT I COME ACROSS PEOPLE SAY TO ME IS THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I'M PAYING FOR WHAT AND WHAT I'M GETTING BACK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO SORT OF MEASURE
THE VALUE OF OUR MEMBERSHIP YOU CAN SEE THE MONEY GOING ONE WAY BUT IT'S QUITE HARD TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF BEING PART OF A CLUB WHICH STRAITS FREELY AT SEPARATE SUCH AS THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF VERY HIGH LEVEL NUMBERS FLOATING ABOUT THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE SENSE OF WHICH IS WHY HAVING BUSINESSES SPEAKING ABOUT WHY THE SINGLE MARKET MATTERS FOR THEM WHY IT'S A GREAT BENEFIT I WAS TALKING TO A HAULAGE COMPANY THE OTHER DAY BEING ABLE TO MOVE FREELY ACROSS EUROPE WITH THE SAME HAULAGE RULES
THESE THINGS REALLY MATTER I THINK GETTING VOICES OF BUSINESS OF ALL SIZES NOT JUST BIG BUSINESS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THOSE BENEFITS WILL START TO BRING MUCH MORE KIND OF SENSE AND CLARITY TO WOW IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH ONE FOR YOU TO PLAY THAT SOME PEOPLE GUYS ACTUALLY NOT THE VOICE OF BUSINESS IT'S THE VOICE OF BRUSSEL SOMEONE SAYING THEY'RE THE BIG BUSINESS THEY HAVE TEND TO BE STATUS QUO EST TO LIKE THE WAY THINGS ARE CURRENTLY ORGANISED YOUR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REPRESENT AN ORGANISATION WHO PUT THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES WHO MANY OF WHOSE MEMBERS
ARE NOT TEARING THE C.B.I. LOLLY FIRST ALWAYS BEAT ONE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS THE U.K. AND ONLY VERY FEW OF THOSE ARE VERY LARGE DISTANCES SO I THINK WE WE WE ARE SPEAKING EVERY DAY TO BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WHAT WAS USUALLY SOME NEW POLLING POST THE DEAL OF YOUR MEMBERS YES WE HAVE A NEW POLL THAT IS LANDING TODAY WITH OUR MEMBERS AND WE ARE ALSO CONSULTING THROUGH A NORMAL A NORMAL ROUTE SO WE WILL WE'RE ABSOLUTELY ASKING THEM AGAIN AND WHAT WE WANT IT WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM IS THE DIFFERENCE THAT THIS IS MAKING THE DIFFERENCE THIS CHOICE IS MAKING TO THEM AND THEN I THINK OUR JOB
IS TO MAKE THAT AS CLEAR AS WE CAN FOR THE BRITISH PUBLIC WE WILL ABSOLUTELY REFLECT THOSE VOICES OR BUSINESSES THAT FIND THE RULES TO HEAVY THERE ARE SOME WE'VE HEARD FROM THEM BEFORE BUT THERE ARE VERY MANY AND IN FACT THE MAJORITY FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHO FIND THE BENEFITS OF THE SINGLE MARKET
OF TREMENDOUS VALUE AND CAN'T SEE AT THE MOMENT HOW OTHER OPTIONS WOULD REPLICATE THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE OH KAY ALL I'VE GOT A FEELING WE'LL BE SEEING PLENTY OF YOU IN THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE C.B.I. WOULD LA MARKETS MAKE OF ALL THIS BRENDA KELLY'S HEAD ANALYST AT LONDON CAPITAL GROUP IF YOU BELIEVE THAT BORIS JOHNSON JOINING OUTTA CAMP MAKES SHORTENS THE ODDS OF HER BRAKES IT JUST A LITTLE BIT THEN WHERE WOULD THIS SHOW UP WOULD IT BE IN STIRLING WHAT'S THE MARKET WHICH IS THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE AS WE LOOK AT THAT
PROBABILITY OF A BREAKS IT HOW DO YOU THINK STUNNING IS GOING TO BE WHERE THE WHOLE THING MANIFESTS ITSELF AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE WHETHER A BORIS GETTING BEHIND THAT THE CAMPAIGN WILL HELP PUSH THE POUND EVEN LOWER REMAINS TO BE SEEN THERE CERTAINLY OF THE SHORT TERM THERE HAS BEEN A SORT OF AVERSION TO THE POUND RECENTLY WITH THAT HAS BEEN DOWN TO THE FACT WE ARE RUNNING QUITE A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THERE'S NO SIGN OF INTEREST RATES BEEN HIKED IN THE VERY NEAR TERM
BUT ULTIMATELY THERE IS ALSO A LOT OF SORT OF TROUBLE AND VOLATILITY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS PRESENTLY I THINK OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM WE CAN SEE THE POUND SACK ME SLIDE OR MAYBE DEMAND FOR BARNES FROM THE U.K. ULTIMATELY COME UNDER PRESSURE AND WE JOKE H.S.B.C. RESULTS THIS MORNING THEY WERE BASICALLY A ONE PER CENT HIGHER THEY WERE LAST YEAR BUT BLOKES WERE TAKEN THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT H.S.B.C. OF COURSE IS THAT RECENTLY DECIDED IT WAS GOING TO STAY IN THE U.K.
SOME HAVE THING THAT WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT FAITH AT THE OUT SAYING IF THEY'RE PREPARED TO TAKE THEIR CHANCES THEN THAT THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN LIFE GOES ON IN OR OUT EIGHTY SPECIES BIG PROBLEM THOUGH HIS COST CUTTING IT CERTAINLY IS OBVIOUSLY A MASSIVE SORT OF DOWN MOVING TOWARDS A BIT'S JOB CUTS AND ULTIMATELY KIND OF TRYING TO RESTRUCTURE ITSELF AWAY FROM THE UNPROFITABLE BUSINESSES BUT IT IS EXPANDING HERSELF IN CHINA DESPITE THE FACT THERE'S GLOBAL GROWTH SLOW AND AND I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF HEAD WINS BUT SECONDLY WE MIGHT ACTUALLY SEE SOME SORT OF FLOOR ON THE SHARE PRICE
IN THE NOTE ON BRENDA KELLY THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED AND IN THE NEXT HOUR WILL BE TALKING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TRINITY MIRROR WHO ARE JUST CONFIRMED TO THE B. B. C.

THE TRIAL OF A WOMAN ACCUSED OF ABDUCTING A NEWBORN BABY IN SOUTH AFRICA IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IS EXPECTED TO START TODAY ZEPHYR NE NURSE WAS SNATCHED FROM HER MOTHER'S BEDSIDE IN CAPE TOWN SHE WAS ONLY REUNITED WITH HER PARENTS BY COINCIDENCE WHEN HER BIOLOGICAL SISTER MET HER AT SCHOOL
H.S.B.C. HAS ANNOUNCED IT'S FULL YEAR FIGURES FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN SHOWING PRE TAX PROFITS WERE UP ONE PER CENT AT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS LOWER THAN ANALYSTS HAD EXPECTED WHICH IS BEING ATTRIBUTED TO A SLOWING CHINESE ECONOMY AND FALLING COMMODITIES PRICES
MORE THAN SIX MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. CHANGE THEIR ENERGY SUPPLIER LAST YEAR THE INDUSTRY REGULATOR OFGEM SAYS THAT REPRESENT AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN MISTER CAMERON WILL FACE THE WRATH OF THE APPROVAL OF M.P.S TODAY OVER THE REFERENDUM SYSTEM POLITICAL NORMA SMITH HE'S GOING THOUGHT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS NORMAN
IT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN WE WILL GET CLEAR SIGN OF WHERE THE BALANCE OF OPINION NOW LIES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY FOLLOWING THE DECISION OF BORIS JOHNSON TO DECLARE FOR
THE OUT CAMPAIGN AND THAT BLUNTLY CHANGES IT SEEMS TO ME THE WHOLE DYNAMIC OF THIS CAMPAIGN SO ELISE SIDE WHICH FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR SO WAS LOOKING SOMEWHAT UNDER POWERED NOW HAVE ON BOARD THE MOST POPULAR FIGURE PROBABLY
IN THE TORY PARTY ONE OF ITS MOST EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATORS A MAN WHO WILL GET HEADLINES AND A MAN WHO WE KNOW GETS VOTES TO THEY ALSO HAVE MICHAEL GO IF THEY HAVE A QUARTER OF THE CABINET ROUGHLY BUT MORE THAN THAT MISTER JOHNSON'S DECISION WE'LL GIVE THE MOMENTUM IT WILL ENCOURAGE OTHER
TORY MINISTERS JUNIOR MINISTERS I SUSPECT TO BREAK RANKS AND ALSO SAY O.K. WELL BORIS JOHNSON AND MICHAEL GO CAN DO IT I CAN DO IT TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF THEM TO SIGN UP FOR THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS THAT POTENTIALLY UP TO HALF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN PARLIAMENT NOW COULD BACK THE LEAD SIDE IN THE COUNTRY IT'S THOUGHT PARTY MEMBERS ARE
IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING AND YOU'VE GOT THE MAYOR THEIR PUTATIVE CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR SAYING HE'S IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING YOU'VE GOT THEIR LEADER OF THEIR BACKBENCH COMMITTEE SAYING HE'S IN FAVOUR LEAVING BLUNTLY THE BALANCE OF FORCES WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS NOW MUCH MUCH MORE EVENLY SPLIT
ROBERT IS IT GOING TO MAKE MISTER CAMERON'S ABILITY TO GOVERN OVER THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS ANY MORE DIFFICULT HAVING SO MANY MEANINGS EXCUSE ME MINISTERS OPPOSED TO HIM ON SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW IT JOHN I THINK I THINK IT IS GOING TO PUT EXTRAORDINARY STRAINS WITHIN GOVERNMENT IN THE IDEA IT CAN BE AN AMICABLE POLITE AFFAIR I WOULD SUGGEST IS UNLIKELY I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT IT MEANS THIS REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WITH THE DECISION OF BORIS JOHNSON IN EFFECT BECOMES A SURROGATE TORY LEADERSHIP CONTEST TOO
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH MISTER CAMERON HE'S INDICATED HE WILL REMAIN IF HE LOSES AND OTHER MINISTERS CAMPAIGNING FOR BRECHT SAID AT SEVEN AND THEN OF COURSE IT WILL REMAIN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IS IMPLAUSIBLE LAST NIGHT OWEN PATERSON A LEADING SCEPTIC FORMER CABINET MINISTERS REPEATEDLY ASKED WHETHER HE THOUGHT MISTER CAMERON SHOULD REMAIN AND DECLINED TO RESPOND I KNOW OTHER LEADING SCEPTIC SUCH AS JOHN REDWOOD ALSO THINK IT EXTREMELY UNLIKELY HE COULD REMAIN BECAUSE HOW COULD YOU EXPECT THE MAN
WHO YOU KNOW HAS WARNED WE WILL BE STRONGER SAFER AND MORE SECURE IN EUROPE TO NEGOTIATE A DEAL WHICH PRESUMABLY WOULD LEAVE US WEAKER MORE ISOLATED MORE VALUABLE NO PRIME MINISTER'S GOING TO DO THAT SO EVEN IF MISTER CAMERON IS NOT FORCED THAT I DOUBT HE WOULD WANT TO REMAIN AS FOR BORIS JOHNSON IF HE LOSES I WOULD NOT EXPECT NUMBER TEN TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS HIM HIS FATHER LAST NIGHT
IF HE LOSES FORGET IT HE WON'T BE GETTING A CABINET JOB AND GEORGE OSBORNE AS THE PUTATIVE SUCCESSOR TO MISTER CAMERON HE MUST KNOW IF HE LOSES THEN HIS PROSPECTS ARE TAKING OVER OUR ALSO FINISHED NORMA THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING TO JOHNSON SENIOR A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME TIME NOW IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN WHEN YOU HEAR THAT PHRASE THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE YOU MIGHT THINK OF PROMISES OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINK THEY LINKING THE GREAT CITIES OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
THEY'RE ALL THERE ALSO DREAMS OF A ROAD TUNNEL STRETCHING FOR MORE THAN THIRTY MILES BETWEEN SHEFFIELD AND MANCHESTER AN IDEA WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYST ROGER HAD BEEN JOINS US NOW BEFORE THE PROBLEMS ROGER JUST TELL US ABOUT WITH THIS IS ABOUT THE LENGTH A CHANNEL TUNNEL ISN'T IT
WELL IT IS IT IS WOOD WILL BE OR WOULD BE ONE OF THE LONGEST TUNNELS IN THE WORLD BUT I HAVE TO SAY NICK AND THIS IS ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT WAS FLOATED AFTER THE CHANCELLOR TALKED ABOUT HIS NORTHERN POWER HAS THE IDEA THAT BY BRINGING TOGETHER THE GREAT CITIES OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND YOU'D CREATE AN ECONOMIC COUNTERBALANCE TO THE MIGHT OF LONDON THEN PEOPLE PITCHED IN WITH IDEAS LET'S HAVE H. S. THREE TO TRANS PENNINE ROUTE TO HIGH SPEED TRANS PENNINE ROUTE LET'S
PERHAPS SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PENNINES BY TUNNELLING RIGHT THEIR WAY UNDERNEATH IT FROM THE EDGE OF SHEFFIELD TO THE EDGE OF MAN'S MANCHESTER WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOT A FIRM PRICING ON THIS YET BUT HE'S EXCITED QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND WHO SORTED AT LAST THERE WAS GOING TO BE A REALLY GOOD ROOT UNDER THE PENNINES ACROSS THE PENNINES WE'RE GOING UNDER IT BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH ADVISING ON THIS AND THE SENSE THAT I'M GETTING IS THAT THE
HEROIC SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED WHEN THE POWERHOUSE WAS TALKED ABOUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON TO THE BACK BURNER AND WHAT'S ON THE FRONT BURNER IS WHAT CAN WE DO NOW MOST CHEAPLY MOST EFFECTIVELY TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER BETWEEN THE CITIES SO BRIEFLY THE IDEA ROGER OF A TUNNEL IS BURIED
I THINK WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE ADVISING ON THIS WHICH IS TRANSPORT FOR THE NAUGHTY SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION I THINK WHAT THEY WILL BOTH SAY IS THAT THEY WANT TO KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE OF THE GREAT TUNNEL BUT ACTUALLY THEY SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOME MORE PRACTICAL THINGS IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD SAY THERE ARE CRITICS WHO SHOULD SAY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING MUCH FURTHER THAN INFRASTRUCTURE TOWARDS TRAINING SKILLS EDUCATION AND TRANSPORT WITHIN CITIES AS WELL AS BETWEEN CITIES
WE'LL HEAR YOUR REPORT A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THAT ROGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN VIRTUAL REALITY IS THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT'S WHAT THE FACEBOOK CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARK WAS A BURGLAR SAID HE WAS SPEAKING AT THE LAUNCH OF A NEW SAMSAM PHONE AND CAMERA AT THE ANNUAL MOBILE WORLD CONFERENCE TRADE SHOW IN BARCELONA HOW TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT IS OF COURSE THEIR MORNING RORY

IN RUSSIA THERE HAS BEEN A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SEE STALIN AS A WARTIME HERO AND A DROP CALL NEATLY PENNY POLES IN THOSE WHO VIEW HIM AS A TYRANT WHOSE PURGES OF SO CALLED ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE LED TO THE EXECUTION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE SO A GROUP OF ACTIVISTS HAVE LAUNCHED AN UNOFFICIAL MEMORIAL PROJECT THEY HOPE WILL BRING HOME THE REAL HUMAN COST OF STALIN'S ACHIEVEMENTS ON MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT SERRA EYNSFORD REPORTS
THE METAL PLAQUES ARE SMALL AND SIMPLE BUT EACH WORD OF THE DRILL FIXES ANOTHER ONE IN PLACE AND ANOTHER NAME IN HISTORY
THERE ARE NOW DOZENS OF THESE NAME PLATES ACROSS MOSCOW MARKING THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF THOSE EXECUTED ON THE ORDERS OF JOSEPH STALIN
THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST BEHIND THE PROJECT RESIDENTS SOMETIMES REFUSED THE PLAQUES CALLING THEM DEPRESSING OR SAYING THAT THEY DON'T WANT THEIR HOUSES TURNED INTO A CEMETERY OLGA STRONGLY DISAGREES SCISSORS MY GRANDFATHER IF IT IS THEN YEAH
YOU THINK SOMETHING DO YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST A SINGLES SORRY MONEY THERE IS SOMETHING SECRET ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW THIS IS SO VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE NOW
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE OR DISAPPEARS COMPLETELY
COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS FACTORY WORKERS EVEN HOUSEWIVES WERE AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND SHOT DURING THE GREAT TERROR STALIN'S PERCH WHICH REACHED ITS FRENZIED HEIGHT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THIRTY EIGHT
THE EERIE SOUND TRACK AT A NEW MOSCOW MUSEUM TO THE OPPRESSIONS IS A MIX OF WIND WHISTLING THROUGH THE LABOUR CAMPS AND THE CREAK OF PRISON DOORS AND SLOWLY SCROLLING UP ONE BALL AT THE EXECUTION
BUT STEP OUT OF HERE AND YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HEAR RUSSIANS TODAY TALKING OF STALIN AS AN EFFECTIVE MANAGER OR HE'S A WAR HERO THAN AS A TYRANT
AND JUST LAST WEEK I WATCHED A NATIONALIST MOB CHANT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AT OPPOSITION ACTIVISTS AND SCREEN FOR NEW PURGES
COME ON GRANDMA NUFF IS THE GULAG MUSEUM DIRECTOR LOOKED WHEN YOU STAB HER LIP AND RATIONS WERE NEVER FORCED TO FACE UP TO WHAT HAPPENED
EVEN WHEN OUR MUSEUM OPENED PEOPLE PROTESTED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED IT I THINK IT'S A NATURAL REACTION TO DENY TRAGIC HISTORY OR PAIN BUT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME
ON THE EDGE OF MOSCOW BEHIND A HEAVY WOODEN GATES THERE'S AN EVEN STUCK A REMINDER OF WHY
STEPPING THROUGH THE CRISP SNOW
IN THE FORESTS AND I'VE REACHED AN AREA WHERE I CAN SEE PHOTOGRAPHS PINNED TO THE TREES JUST THE LAMINATED
PRINT OUTS MOST OF THEM SOME OF THEM WITH THE CLASSIC FLOWERS TAPED BENEATH AS WELL
LIKE THIS ONE HERE JUST LOOKING
SO IF I'D SAY ELEVEN INVICTA WHICH EXECUTED MARCH NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT I DON'T KNOW HIS PARTICULAR STORY YET OF COURSE
BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE HIM LYING IN THE GROUND HERE BENEATH THE TREES
YEAH WE'VE GOT A BIT OF THE LOVE INDEED LIVE HERE FOR ABOUT AN ANNA AND MARIA WERE VISITING COMMON I'VE GOT FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE GOT HIM WILL YOU
THE SISTER SHOW ME A PHOTO OF THEIR GRANDFATHER KENRICK RUBENSTEIN WHO WAS A SOVIET RAILWAYS MANAGER KILLED IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT I USED TO LOOK AT THAT
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE TAUGHT HISTORY IN SUCH A WAY NOW IS THAT THESE VICTIMS I JUSTIFIED THEY SAY WELL LEAPT FORWARD SO THEY WERE VICTIMS SO WHAT
THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IS IN CHARGE OF THE LANDS HERE NOW BUT THE MASS GRAVE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN MARKED OUT THE ONLY MEMORIALS OF THOSE LEFT BY RELATIVES
BACK IN THE CITY CENTRE THOUGH THE NUMBER OF METAL PLAQUES THIS GROWING
AS OLGA LOOKS UP AT HER OWN GRANDFATHER'S NAME NOW ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE THAT HE WAS TAKEN FROM TO BE SHOT SHE TELLS ME THE LAST ADDRESS PROJECTS IS CRITICAL
OCCASIONS WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE CAN UPSET OUT ASKING QUESTIONS OR STABS THINKING
IF WITH DUMP REVISES OCCASIONS THERE WOULD BE NO HOPE FOR FUTURE O.K.
SARAH ARRANGED FOR REPORTING THE OTHER TIME WAS ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NOW FROM NAPOLEONIC PRISONERS OF WAR TO ITALIAN BRICK WORKERS TO EAST EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS MANY DIFFERENT MIGRANT COMMUNITIES HAVE MADE THEIR HOME IN PETERBOROUGH OVER THE CENTURIES SO WHAT DOES THE CATHEDRAL CITY THINK OF DAVID CAMERON'S Y. YOU DEAL AND HOW FAR COULD THE DIVERSITY OF ITS POPULATION AFFECT HOW PEOPLE VOTE IN THIS JUNE'S REFERENDUM KATHRYN STAND CHESHAM HAS BEEN FINDING OUT
AND UM REAL HANES AN ICONIC NINETEEN EIGHTIES ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN STARRING ROY KINNEAR EXTOLLED THE VIRTUES OF PETERBOROUGH IS A VERY MODERN PLACE TO LIVE REMEMBER NIGGER ENTERS THE CITY HAS ALWAYS ATTRACTED MIGRANT COMMUNITIES AROUND A FIFTH OF THEIR CURRENT POPULATION WAS BORN OUTSIDE THE U.K. AS WHAT
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
TWENTY EIGHTH OF JANUARY THIS YEAR AND I AM LOOKING FOR A JOB
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT NEED ANY MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT DARN THING SO
SOMETHING SHE WHY DO DES
I AM VERY SAD WORKING PETS ON THERE WITH MY WIFE WE BOTH WORKING WE DON'T TAKE AN AMENITIES ON THE ARGIE HOOP PEOPLE COME HERE ON THE FULL BENEFIT
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE DO YES I THINK I KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WILL DO THAT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PETERBOROUGH ON AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PETE MCCLOSKEY SECOND GENERATION POLISH HERSELF
EMPLOYS SOME MIGRANT WORKERS AT HIS SMALL PRINTING BUSINESS PEOPLE I'VE EMPLOYED HERE HAVEN'T COME HERE LOOKING SEEKING BOTH BENEFITS
IF YOU WERE TO SPEAK TO MICHAEL WORKERS ACROSS THIS REGION
THEY DEPEND ON BENEFITS BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS PER WEEK ARE SO POOR AND THERE ARE HOURS UP THERE PRETTY MUCH YOUR STANDARD ZERO HOUR CONTRACTS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THEM WANTING TO HAVE THE BACK UP OF A BENEFIT SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR THEM BUT WOULD THAT BE THE REASON FOR THEM COMING TO THE U.K. PROBABLY NOT
JUST ACROSS THE ROAD ON THE SAME INDUSTRIAL ESTATE TOM WAKEFORD RUNS ANOTHER SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTIVE COATING FOR PERFORMANCE CARS
I MEAN I'VE NOT HAD A CHANCE OR CAN IT REAL DETAIL BUT FROM WHAT I SEE IT DOESN'T KICK IN TILL TWENTY TWENTY
AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT THOSE ALREADY
ANYBODY LIKE I WAS THAT WAS SITTING AT LUTON AIRPORT RIGHT WATCHING PREGNANT WOMEN FLYING IN FROM GOOD DANSK FROM OTHER PLACES IMPORTANT AND THEN FLYING OUT AGAIN WITH THE BEARD
BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY ALL ON BENEFITS WE KNOW THEY'RE ON BENEFITS WHY ARE WE PEE AND FOR THOSE BENEFITS
BACK IN THE CITY CENTRE MANY BELIEVE ISSUES AROUND MIGRANT WORKERS WILL DEFINE THIS REFERENDUM LOCALLY WHICHEVER ANGLE THERE COMING FROM
IMMIGRATION IS THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME THOUGH I THINK FOR THE COUNTRY IT'S BETTER THAT WE STAY
BUT JUST FOR THAT ISSUE OF HOBNAIL VOTE WE'VE GOT TO BE PART OF EUROPE
IT'S NOT FOR DISCUSSION THE MARGARET ARE THOSE LOCALLY AS AREA I LIVE NEAR FARMERS' BUYER SAID WITHOUT THIS WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO THEIR CROPS DOI I WERE TEACHER AND I KNOW THAT IT IT'S A HUGE IMPACT ON OTHERS ALL SEAS
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WE CAN'T COPE
WITH THE SHEER NUMBERS HUNDRED PERCENT GOOD DECISION ABOUT CAMERON DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT COME TO BRITAIN TO LOOK FOR IT IT'S NOT ABOUT TOO MANY BUT THEY'RE GETTING LAZY AS WELL
I THINK IT'S GOOD TO KEEP PEOPLE WORKING
THAT WAS A REPORT FROM CATHERINE STAND LISTENING TO IT JONATHAN PORTERS OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH HE'S WRITTEN A VERY VERY LONG BLOCK ANALYSING THE BENEFIT CHANGES THAT DAVID CAMERON SAYS HE'S DELIVERED YOU CALLED THEM JONATHAN ALICE IN THE WONDERLAND WHY SO I THOUGHT IT WAS PARTICULARLY IRONIC
BEFORE THE START OF THIS RE NEGOTIATION WE KNEW FROM RESEARCH AND JUST FROM ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT RATHER FEW PEOPLE IN EASTERN EUROPE KNEW VERY MUCH ABOUT THE U.K. SYSTEM OF IN WORK BENEFITS BECAUSE IT IS QUITE UNUSUAL WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER IS CHANGED ALL THAT
HE'S ADVERTISED IT IS ADVERTISED IT SO NOW YOU HAVE THE POLISH PAPERS HAVE BEEN FULL OF LITTLE ELSE FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO SO IT'S PERHAPS THE BIGGEST AWARENESS RAISING CAMPAIGN OF THE BENEFIT SYSTEM IN MY MEMORY OTHER YOU'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB THERE AND HE'S IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW MARR YESTERDAY HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT A LOT OF THE DETAIL ON BENEFITS HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETE THE LEGAL WORK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR HOW THE DEPARTMENT YOU ONCE WORKED FOR
WORK FOR PAINT WORK AND PENSIONS WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES THAT'S RIGHT IT WILL ALL HAVE TO BE WRITTEN DOWN IN LEGAL LANGUAGE FIRST BY THE COMMISSION AND THEN PASSED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHO WERE QUITE LIKELY TO AMEND BITS AND PIECES OF IT AND THEN IT WILL HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE PHASING IN OF TAX CREDITS IN HOUSING BENEFIT
FOR WORKERS OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE IN PERMITTED WITH THE SAME COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSAL CREDIT BECAUSE REMEMBER THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL BE SHIFTING OVER AT UNIVERSAL CREDIT OVER EXACTLY THE SAME PERIOD SO I DO NOT PITY I DO READ A PITY MY FORMER COLLEAGUES HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS ARE YOU SAYING HE MIGHT ACTUALLY NOT
PROVED TO BE POSSIBLE I THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE THESE THINGS ARE POSSIBLE IF YOU THROW ENOUGH RESOURCES ENOUGH PROGRAMMERS ENOUGH PEOPLE IN JOB CENTRES AT THEM BUT IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE COMPLICATED IN THE END IT WILL NEITHER SAY VERY MUCH MONEY NORMALLY DO VERY MUCH TO REDUCE MIGRATION FLOWS ONE SPECIFIC THING THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAD TO CONCEDE IS THAT HE WOULDN'T SCRAP CHILD BENEFIT BEING SENT HOME TO POLAND ROMANIA BULGARIA WHEREVER BUT HE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO ALTER THE LEVEL
TO THE LEVEL OF THE COST OF LIVING IN THOSE COUNTRIES TRICKY TO DO TRICKY TO DO BOOKS YOU HAVE TO SET THE RATES FOR TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE CAUGHT EVEN TRICKIER HOWEVER IS THE ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLICATED PEOPLE MOVE BACK AND FORTH THEIR KIDS MOVE BACK AND FORTH ALL THESE TRANSITIONS IN THEORY WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMMODATED
THIS TIME BY THE H.M.R.C. COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND YET OR DO YOU FORGIVE ME AN ECONOMIST MISSING THE POLITICAL POINTS YES THIS IS ONLY A SMALL STEP BUT IT IS A STEP IN THERE BE THE BEGINNING OF QUITE A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN WHICH THE WEALTHIER COUNTRIES OF THE E.U. SAY WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO PAY BENEFITS IN THE WAY WE HAVE TO ANYBODY WHO FANCIES COMING
I THINK THAT'S RATHER UNLIKELY REMEMBER THIS IS STRICTLY A TIME LIMITED EMERGENCY BRAKE IT CAN ONLY LAST FOR SEVEN YEARS THE GERMANS BACK TO OTHER COUNTRIES BACK TIM PERHAPS THEY WILL PUSH IN FUTURE TREATY CHANGES FOR FURTHER CHANGES I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT WHAT ANGELA MERKEL SAID IN THERE MARTIN THE SUMMIT WHICH WAS REPORTED IN THE SUNDAY TIMES YESTERDAY I THINK WAS THAT SHE KNEW THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT BUT DAVID CAMERON WANTED IT SO HE HAD TO GIVE IT TO HER FOR ME THE BIG SYMBOL OF THIS EXACT POLITICAL SIMILAR EXACTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID IN THIS COUNTRY WE NEVER VOTED FOR THIS OPEN BORDERS WITH STUFF WE NEVER VOTED FOR ALL THESE IMMIGRANTS BUT ACTUALLY THE DEAL IS VERY CLEAR REAFFIRMED THE PRINCIPLE FREE MOVEMENT NOW
WITH A REAL THE BAKING BEGIN IF WE VOTE FOR THIS THEN WE'VE EXCEPT ONE LAST THING ON THE REAL DEBATE THEN YOU ARE CLEARLY IN FAVOUR OF A MEMBERSHIP OF EUROPE LISTENING TO YOU WHO WOULDN'T MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS IS PRECISELY THE PROBLEM PRECISELY THE PROBLEM ALL WE WANT TO DO IS HAVE INFLUENCE OVER OUR OWN BENEFITS AND YOU SIT HERE SAYING ALL KNOW THE LAWYERS WILL GET IT THEY'LL I HAVE TO BE AGREEMENT TWENTY EIGHT COUNTRIES
IT'S NOT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR OWN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL FROM THE WIDER ISSUE OF WHETHER WE SHOULD STAY ED ON THE PARTICULAR ISSUE OF FREE MOVEMENT I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT BROUGHT ECONOMIC BENEFITS NOT JUST OF THE POLES THAT ACTUALLY TO THIS COUNTRY OVERALL WE HAVE BENEFITED ECONOMICALLY FROM PEOPLE COMING HERE IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR GROWTH IT HASN'T HURT JOBS IN BEEN ONE WORD IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT
LIKE IT OR LUMP IT ISN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT IF WE WANT IF WE DON'T LIKE FREE MOVEMENT THEN WE WILL HAVE TO VOTE FLAVOUR THROUGHOUT JONATHAN US THANK YOU IMOGEN

THANK YOU ZEB IT IS EIGHT MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE SUIT THE TIE THE FLAT AND HAIR
TOLD US PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO KNOW EVEN BORIS JOHNSON THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A SERIOUS MOMENT HAVING BEEN IN HIS OWN WORDS VEERING ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE A SHOPPING TROLLEY ON THE U.K.'S FUTURE IN EUROPE THIS IS HOW THE MAYOR OF LONDON ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A NEW RELATIONSHIP BASED MORE ON TRADE
CORPORATION BUT AS I SAY WITH MUCH LESS OF THIS SUPER NATIONAL ELEMENT THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED AFTER A HUGE AMOUNT OF OF HEARTACHE I WILL BE ADVOCATING VOTE LEAVE OR WHATEVER THE TEAM IS
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM BECAUSE I WANT A BETTER DEAL
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY HE WAS A MOMENT THERE HIGHLIGHTED NOT JUST THE DRAMATIC SPLIT AT THE TOP OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOT JUST THE AMBITION OF A MAN WHO COULD BE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER VERY VERY SOON BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THIS COUNTRY COULD WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS TEAR UP WHAT HAS BEEN THE BASIS OF ALL FOREIGN AND ECONOMIC POLICY FOR THE PAST
HALF A CENTURY WHEN BORIS JOHNSON WAS AT UNIVERSITY TORY MINISTERS IN MARGARET THATCHER'S GOVERNMENT WERE HAVING A VERSION OF THIS ARGUMENT AMONGST THEM LEAVING THEM LORD LAWSON THEN CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER HE IS NOW CHAIRMAN OF THAT CAMPAIGN THAT BORIS STRUGGLED TO REMEMBER THE NAME OF VOTE LEAVE ANY JOINS US FROM THE READY CAR GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING BORIS JOHNSON SPOKE OF GETTING A BETTER DEAL FOR BRITAIN DOESN'T THAT REVEAL THAT YOU WANT TO TEAR UP ONE SET OF TREATIES AND THEN SPEND MANY MANY MANY YEARS TRYING TO RENEGOTIATE A WHOLE SET OF NEW ONES
BORIS SPEAKS FOR HIMSELF AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT HE'S COME OUT FOR LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IT IS THE RIGHT AND NECESSARY CALLS FOR OUR COUNTRY
AND HE IS A SUPERB CAMPAIGN HE'S A GREAT ASSET OF THE COURT I'M DELIGHTED I THAT'S WHY I ASKED ABOUT THE ISSUE RATHER THAN THE PERSONALITY EVEN REALITY THE IMPRESSION IS THAT WE BREAK FREE IF WE SUDDENLY LEAVE EUROPE ISN'T THE REALITY THAT WE SIMPLY GET BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER SERIES OF NEGOTIATIONS MUCH LONGER MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THE ONES THE PRIME MINISTER'S BEEN INVOLVED IN WHICH WILL TAKE MANY MANY YEARS
NOT AT ALL WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BY THE UNITED KINGDOM BY HAD BETTER BRITISH DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND ABOUT TIME WE BECAME A SELF GOVERNING INDEPENDENT DEMOCRACY AND WE HAVE A FAR BETTER FUTURE ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY AND EVERY OTHER WAY ONCE WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT NOT AT ALL YOU SAY HOW LONG DID IT TAKE CANADA TO GET A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE
COWARD DID WHAT HE DID WE SHALL DO WHAT WE DO THEY TOOK SEVEN CERTAINLY AS IRRELEVANT THAT HE'S TOTALLY A RIM AND THIS IS A NONSENSE WHICH HAS BEEN PUT OUT I'M SURPRISED AT YOU FALLEN WHY DID IRRELEVANT COS ISN'T THAT PRECISELY WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IF WE LEFT THE
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A DRAW WE WOULD NEGOTIATE WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT CIVIL SERVICE WE HAVE WE HAVE A COMPETENT GOVERNMENT WE WILL NEGOTIATE AGREEMENTS WE ARE ONCE AGAIN INDEPENDENT ONCE AGAIN
SELF GOVERNING COUNTRY AND THAT IS RIGHT FOR THE ECONOMY'S RIGHT MIDDLE NAME FOR NOT SLOGAN I IN THOSE ARE SLOGANS I ASKED YOU A QUESTION HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NEGOTIATE A NEW DEAL LET'S LET'S LOOK AT NORWAY NORWAY PAYS IN A LOT OF MONEY TO THE YEAR NORWAY ACCEPTS THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE COULD LEAVE THE E.U. WITHOUT HAVING TO DO THAT
NO IS A TINY LITTLE COUNTRY IT'S A VERY NICE COUNTRY THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE BUT IT'S A TINY LITTLE COUNTRY WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THESE OTHER COUNTRIES THEY DESPERATELY NEED A MARKET THE THEY SELL US THREE HUNDRED BILLION
OF GOODS AND SERVICES A YEAR FAR MORE THAN WE SELL TO THEM THEY NEED US AND THERE WILL BE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT SIGNED PRETTY SWIFTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE MARGARET THATCHER'S CHANCELLOR YOU BACK TO THE SINGLE EUROPEAN ACT USED WHOLE PURPOSE
WAS DOING TO ENSURE JUST TO GIVE YOU JOHN'S AIM WAS TO ENSURE THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COULD ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE RULES OF A MARKET TO MAKE SURE THE BRITISH BUSINESS WAS NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SO WHY DID HE COULD BE SO EASY IF WE SIMPLY LEFT
AS A MATTER OF FACT I TOLD MARGARET TIME PRIVATELY THEN I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SINGLE EUROPEAN ED CAN WATCH YOU'D AGREED TO PAY
ANOTHER EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ICKY EUROPEAN COUNCIL NICKI I WAS NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH IT DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RULES OR YOU THINK HE'LL BE EASIER TO HAVE THE RULES IMPLEMENTED ON BEHALF OF BRITISH BUSINESS IF WE'RE NOT IN THE CLUB THAN IT WOULD BE IF WE ARE IN THERE
NICK YOU'RE USUALLY FAR MORE PERCEPTIVE THAN THIS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS NONSENSE THE THE WHERE OUR EXPORTS TO THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE FIFTEEN PERCENT ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ECONOMY OF COURSE WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY EUROPEAN RULES FOR THAT FIFTEEN PERCENT JUST AS WHEN WE'RE EXPORTING TO THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY UNITED STATES RULES WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
ONCE WHERE ART IS HAVE THESE MORASS OF EUROPEAN REGULATIONS COVERING THE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT AND MORE OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY WHICH IS NON CONSTITUTE EXPOSED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION JUST A LAST GREAT WHATEVER BETTER OFF FORGIVE ME TAKE YOU BACK TO THE HISTORY BUT A CABINET SPLIT A LONG SERVING PRIME MINISTER WITH A FUTURE THREATENED BY EUROPE IT'S AWFULLY FAMILIAR THIS ISN'T IT
THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STREET BUT IT IS NONE OF OUR PEOPLE THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT NEEDS TO BE ARGUED AT THAT LEVEL AND NOT ON THE LEVEL OF PERSONALITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
QUARTER PAST SEVEN IT'S ALMOST FIVE YEARS SINCE THE PANORAMA PROGRAMME REVEALED THE SHOCKING ABUSE THAT WAS TAKING PLACE AT WINTERBOURNE VIEW A CARE HOME FOR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES IT RESULTED IN A RECOMMENDATION THAT CARE HOMES LIKE WINTERBOURNE VIEW SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN WELL HAVE ON THE WALLS AND HE IS THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN SOME SCHOLARS WHO HAD LIVED THERE AND WAS BADLY MISTREATED
I SHALL PICTURES OR SAM WHEN HE WAS IN WITH A BORN FUEL IMPETUS AND NOW HE'S FUR WAS SO MUCH OVER THE LAST
FOR YEARS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HE'S IN A PLACE NOW
IT'S GOT ITS OWN LITTLE FLAT WITHIN A HOME HE'S GOT CARE FOR ROUND THE CLOCK CARE HE
HE'S SUCH A HAPPY PERSON BUT
ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND YOU STUCK IN THE TRUTH
WELL AS MY WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN MOVED OUT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND THE MAN WHO SAYS THAT IS THE STEPHEN BURDEN WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS AND HE IS THE MAN WHO PRODUCED THAT REPORT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN STEVEN WHAT JOHN I'M PRODUCING MY FINAL REPORT ON PROGRESS TODAY AND AS PART OF THAT I'VE BEEN CONSULTING WITH PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES
AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO ME IS THEY'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE PACE OF CHANGE TOO CLOSE INSTITUTIONS AND THEY REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE THE CHALLENGE AHEAD THERE ARE SOME ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES VARIOUS SORTS OF ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE DISCOVERED IT'S NOT JUST CLOSING INSTITUTIONS IT'S AROUND HOW WE AS SOCIETY TREAT
SUCH PEOPLE IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IN A ROOM IN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY MY MAJOR RECOMMENDATION TODAY IS FOUR AT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMISSIONER FOR LEARNING DISABILITY SOMEONE WHO WILL DRIVE AND ACT AS AN ADVOCATE FOR CHANGE AND FOR MAKING MORE PROGRESS AND PART OF THAT CHANGE MUST BE THE CLOSING DOWN OF THESE INSTITUTIONS IT ABSOLUTELY MUST THAT WAS THE MAIN RECOMMENDATION I'D MADE
AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED IT NO BUT I THINK THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THERE I'M I'M FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A CLOSURE PROGRAMME THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO RUB PROVISION THE WHO EXACTLY I'M CONVINCED N.H.S. ENGLAND HAVE GOT THE THE RIGHT APPROACH THAT THEY WILL DELIVER IT WILL TAKE TIME
BUT ACTUALLY WHAT ARE THE PIGS HAD DISCOVERED RECENTLY IS THAT THE NUMBERS IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT A RICH SO IT'S IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE IS A BIG JOB IT IS A BIG JOB AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NOW NEED THAT COMMISSIONER FOR PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES WHO WILL REALLY REALLY ACTORS A CHAMPION FOR THE CHANGE AND ENSURE THOSE INSTITUTION THOSE INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO CLOSE I'VE BEEN REALLY SHOCKED BY WHAT I'VE HEARD HER OUT SECLUSION
AROUND OVER MEDICATION AROUND THE USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT IT IS AN INTOLERABLE WAY TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH LEARNING TO SEE YOU YOU SAID THAT HE WAS BY THEIR NATURE ARE ABUSIVE EXACTLY I THINK INSTITUTIONS ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR PEOPLE IS WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND IN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED PROPERLY AND WE HEARD THAT LOVELY STORY ABOUT SAM WHO IS NOW
IN THE IDEAL SITUATION IS HE'S GOT A NICE SELF CONTAINED FLAT THIS SOMEBODY KEEP AN EYE ON HIM AND HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A GOOD LIFE NOW BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE IS ABLE TO HAVE THAT SAME TREATMENT I THINK THE KIND OF ITS CARE IS ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND I DON'T CARE IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER SO IT'S HAD IT'S BIZARRE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ACHIEVE A BETTER QUALITY OF CARE
MORE COST EFFECTIVELY BY RAMPING UP COMMUNITY PROVISION IT IT THE CARE IN THE COMMUNITY IS CHEAPER BUT PRESUMABLY ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WHO CAN DO IT WHO CAN DELIVER THAT EXACTLY MULLET THINKS I SAY MY REPORT TODAY IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TRAIN UP
SOME TEN THOUSAND STAFF TO SUPPORT PEOPLE UM IT'S A DIFFICULT AND IT'S A CHALLENGING JOB LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES BUT I KNOW FROM THE WORK THE CHARITIES DO THERE ARE SOME INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE REALLY HIGH QUALITY SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY I'VE SEEN IT I'VE SEEN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT WHICH I BELIEVE HE'S GREAT I HAVE SEEN INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND THE RESULTS OF THAT ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN THERE FOR DECADES AND IT'S WRONG
FOR STEPHEN BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN THEY GO ON A TWITTER FEED NEWSY AN INTERESTING PICTURE AT THE FIRST STAND STANDALONE NEWSPAPER IN THIRTY YEARS TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT WEEK SO I'M JACK IS HERE WITH MORE DETAILS YEAH AND A COPY IN FACT A DUMMY COPY OF THE NEW DAY IT'LL BE LAUNCHED A WEEK TODAY THE FIRST ISSUE WILL BE FREE THEN TWO WEEKS AT TWENTY FIVE P. BEFORE SETTLING AT FIFTY PENCE IT SEEMS TO FLY IN THE FACE OF EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS
CIRCULATION'S DWINDLING AS PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS ONLINE ONCE THEY'RE ONLINE VERY RELUCTANT TO PAY FOR IT LET'S TALK TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE PUBLISHER TRINITY MIRROR SIMON FOX ARE YOU MAD WELL I TERRY MUCH OPEN NOT THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT TO LOOK THIS ISN'T AN IDEA WE DREAMED UP OVERNIGHT THIS IS AN IDEA THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR OVER A YEAR IT COMES FROM
DEEP CONSUMER INSIGHT TALKING TO THOUSANDS OF READERS MANY OF WHOM ARE LAPSING OUT OF PRINT AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT ABOUT HALF A MILLION READERS EACH YEAR CHOOSE NOT TO BUY A NEWSPAPER WE DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE LIKE THAT IF THE PRODUCT IS RIGHT
OH KAY AND LOOKING AT IT HERE IT'S A COLOURFUL THING IT RUNS ABOUT FORTY PAGES IT'S GOT A TURQUOISE BLUE MAST HEAD WHO WERE YOU AIMING THIS AT YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S GOT A REALLY BRIGHT STYLISH COLOURFUL DESIGN YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED THE NEWSPRINT IS THICKER AND WHITER THAN NORMAL NEWSPRINT IT'S FORTY PAGES SO IT'S A CONCISE READ
AND REALLY WE'RE TARGETING A WIDE DEMOGRAPHIC OF WOMEN AND MEN AND IT'S FOR WOMEN OR MEN WHO ELSE IS THAT DOGS I THINK THE POINT IS PERHAPS OTHERS MIGHT SAY MEN AND WOMEN THERE'S A DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ON THE WOMEN AND MEN THERE'S A SLIGHT THERE'S A SLIGHT NUANCE BUT REALLY IT'S FOR READERS WHO DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO THINK O.K. SO THIS IS GOING TO BE IS THIS THE THE HEIGHT OF THE INDEPENDENT IS THIS THE DAILY MIRROR LIKE TO THE DAILY MIRROR
ABSOLUTELY NOT THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NEW NEWSPAPER WITH A DIFFERENT EDITORIAL TEAM IT'S NOT A MIRROR LIGHT IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM AND HAS IT'S GOT EH WE HEARD LAST WEEK COURSE THE INDEPENDENT IS GOING TO GO ONLINE ONLY ON THE DAY OR THE DAY AFTER THIS NEWSPAPER COMES OUT AND OF COURSE THE EYE WAS SOLD WHICH WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL OR SOLD OFF
JOHNSTON PRESS HAS THAT GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF THIS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NO REALLY RICK GENUINELY NOT NO I MEAN YOU CAN'T DREAM UP A NEWSPAPER OVERNIGHT OVER YOU CAN PUT A HURRY UP BECAUSE YOU REALISE SOMETHING'S GOING TO BE INDEPENDENT AND THERE'LL BE ONE LESS NEWSPAPER ON THE NEW STAN LET'S MAKE SURE OURS TAKES THAT SLOT YOU MAY THINK THAT BUT REALLY OTHER THAN A VERY SAD DEMISE AT THE INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT SONNY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF THIS LAUNCH AND WE'LL HAVE A LIFE ONLINE AS WELL ONLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
O.K. SO THERE'S THE ON LINE VERSION OF IF I LOOK THROUGH THE A.B.C. FIGURES HERE OF CIRCULATION'S I SEE DAILY MIRROR DOWN TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT YEAR ON YEAR TELEGRAPH DOWN FIVE THEY RECORD DEPTH OR DARRYL AND IN FACT THE ONLY TWO WHICH ACTUALLY UP AND THAT'S THE DAILY STAR WHICH DON'T SUPPOSED TO BE COMPETING WITH AND THE TIMES IS UP ONE POINT NINE PER CENT THAT THE ECONOMICS OF THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS ARE ATROCIOUS
WELL WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A ONE MONTH'S CIRCULATION FIGURES AND THE ECONOMICS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT TO CIRCULATION FIGURES AND WE'RE STILL A VERY PROFITABLE PUBLISHER BUT THE FACT IS NEWSPAPERS ARE IN LONG TERM DECLINE AND PARTLY BECAUSE THAT ISN'T THERE'S NOT BEEN INNOVATION IN THE PRODUCT I MEAN WE'VE STARTED WITH A CLEAN SHEET OF PAPER
BASED ON WHAT READERS HAVE TOLD US AND WE'VE DESIGNED SOMETHING NEW AND WE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ARREST SOME OF THOSE WORRYING DECLINE THE PROBLEM WITH READER RESEARCHES THE EVERYONE ASKED SAYS THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BIG ISSUES OF THE DAY IN HERE A REASONABLE DEBATE ABOUT AT THE TRUTH IS ACTUALLY WHERE THEY WILL SEE THE MOST THEY'LL GRAB THAT THEY'LL SEE WHATEVER GRABS THEM ON THE NEW STANDARD BY THAT WELL HOPEFULLY THEY'LL SEE THIS AND THEY WILL GRAB THIS BECAUSE IT WILL BE APPEALING
AND IT WILL BE WELL PRICED AND MAYBE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'LL DO ALL RIGHT SUMMER FOX WILL SEE IT GOES ON SALE NEXT WE TALK TO THE EDITOR IN THE NEXT HOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SIMON IT'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THERE WAS IT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IS IN BRITAIN'S NATIONAL INTEREST OR A CYNICAL CALCULATION OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN HIS OWN WHAT IN OTHER WORDS LIES BEHIND THE DECISION OR BORIS JOHNSON
TO CAMPAIGN TO LEAVE DO YOU A MAN WHO LETS REMEMBER ONCE SAID I'VE NEVER BEEN AN OUTER WELL WE CAN ASK MISTER JOHNSON IS MOP A BLONDE HAIRS JUST COME INTO THIS STUDIO NOT V. JOHNSON HIS FATHER STANLEY JOHNSON IS NOT JUST HIS DAD BUT A FORMER CONSERVATIVE M.E.P. AND CO CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS WAIT FOR IT
FOR EUROPE STANLEY JOHNSON DID YOU EXPERIENCE THIS AGONISING THAT BORIS HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH BECAUSE HE TOLD A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRIVATE FAMILY FRIENDS PEOPLE I KNOW THAT HE WOULD VOTE FOR REMAIN
NO I I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO YOU KNOW REVEALED IN ALL THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WHAT I WHAT I WILL SAY NICK IS THAT I THINK HE HAS DONE A REALLY
WELL THOUGHT OUT MOVE IN IT IT WERE I SAY MOVE IT'S A IT'S A MOVE IN THE SENSE IT REPRESENTS HIS DEEP CONVICTION THAT AT THIS MOMENT THIS IS WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO NOW WAS CLEAR I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE ON FAMILY
HE WAS CLEAR WASN'T HE DID HE MIGHT WELL VOTE FOR REMAIN THAT THERE WAS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE BALANCE WAS JUST IN THE OTHER DIRECTION KNOW I HAVEN'T GOT A KIND OF DAILY LOGGO WHERE BORIS STRODE ON ON THESE ISSUES WERE WHAT I HAVE DONE
IS THAT OUR LIVES VERY CAREFULLY THERE'S THE REPORT YOU MADE IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY I LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY TO WHAT HE SAID YES AND HONESTLY I THINK TO SAY THAT THIS IS A CAREER IS SORT OF MOVE I WOULD BE AT A TOTAL TRAVESTY I MEAN I CAN'T THINK OF MANY MORE CAREER ENDING MOVE THAN TO DO WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU WANTED TO BE YOU KNOW HE'S LEAVING THE MAYORAL T. AND N. MAY IF YOU WANTED TO GET HIM A NICE JOB
IN THE CABINET ON MAKE THEM MADE OF EIGHTH THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT I KNOW BUT BUT THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL BE CHOSEN NOT BY THE ELECTORATE IT WILL BE CHOSEN BY CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS BECAUSE DAVID CAMERON HAS GUARANTEED HE'LL GO BEFORE THE NEXT LECTURE ON US AND THEREFORE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS WAY TO YOUR ICON YOU AGREE I THINK YOU'RE JUST DEVALUING THIS YOUR G. VALERIUS COS WHAT BORIS HAS DONE
AND I BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK I AGREE WITH THIS BUT WHAT HE HAS DONE IS PUT ON THE TABLE WHAT THE REAL ISSUE IS AND THE REAL ISSUE IS DOES THE BRITISH PEOPLE ACCEPT THE LOSS OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT ENTAILS BEING PART OF THE E.U. NOW I PERSONALLY ACCEPTED BECAUSE I'D MUCH PREFER TO BE FROM A SMALL FISH IN A BIGGER POT AND THAT A BIG FISH IN A SMALL POND THAT IS THE ISSUE AND BORIS IS POSE THAT VERY CLEARLY TODAY AND WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR THAT LET'S PURSUE THE ISSUE THEY'RE NOT THE PERSONALITY
YOU ARE AS I SAY CO CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR EUROPE YOU SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE IRRITATION MAYBE THE ANGER THAT WE FEEL ABOUT BRUSSELS DAY IN DAY OUT FOR SOME GREAT AGAIN YOU ARE SO RIGHT YOU ARE SO RIGHT YOU KNOW I COULDN'T HAVE PUT IT BETTER MYSELF OF COURSE I PARTI PRIS IN A SENSE THAT I STARTED LIFE

ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR EUROPE I FITTED UP BY THE WAY WITH BARBARA YOUNG BECAUSE WE NEED AN ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH ACROSS THE WHOLE OF YOUR WE NEED FOR BRITAIN'S VOICE TO FEATURE IN THE WIDER ENVIRONMENT AS WELL LAST WORD IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I NEED THINK WE'LL DIG THAT ARCHIVE AT A YEAR OR TWO'S TIME AND SAY THAT WAS THE MOMENT A NEW PRIME MINISTER MADE HIS PITCH FOR THE JOB

CUP AGAINST MANCHESTER CITY INCIDENCE OF COIN THROWING AFTER CITY'S EQUALISER WILL RESULT IN THE PERPETRATORS RECEIVING BANDS FROM THE STAMFORD BRIDGE STADIUM ACCORDING TO A CLUB STATEMENT
BUT THE DECISION OF CITY MANAGER MANUEL PELLEGRINI DE FEEL SIX TEENAGERS FIVE OF THEM GAINING FIRST TEAM DEBBIE'S RAISES THAT FAMILIAR ISSUE OF PRIORITIES AND QUESTIONS ABOUT MANAGERS LIKE IN RESPECT FOR THE OLDEST CUP COMPETITION IN THE WORLD MITIGATION PELLEGRINI DOES HAVE A MIDWEEK CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH AT DYNAMO KIEV
WE HAD TO TAKE HER DO IMPORTANT THIS IS DIFFICULT THIS IS SUN BUT THERE WOULD BE THERE WITH A CUP WHAT WE COULDN'T DO IT WAS TO REPEAT AFTER THREE DAYS HAVING TO DO A LONG TROUBLE A LITTLE
WE DO THIS ISSUE ABOUT THIS MOMENT WE NEED TO DO IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MOBLEY WELL B.B.C.'S CHIEF FOOTBALL WRITER FILM MCNULTY IS ON THE LINE AND THINK ON THIS OCCASION PELLEGRINI MIGHT HAVE A POINT WELL YES I THINK AS YOU STATED IN HIS PAST HISTORY FEEL LIKE HE DOES HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF FEELING STRONG TEAMS AND DOMESTIC CUP COMPETITIONS WERE CLEARLY HERE HE FELT HIS HAND HAD BEEN FORCED BY THE FACT THAT THE KICKOFF FOR THIS FIFTH ROUND TIE WAS AT FOUR P.M. ON A SUNDAY THEY HAVE A LONG FLIGHT TO KIEV TODAY
HEAD OF A VERY IMPORTANT LAST SIXTEEN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GAME AGAINST DYNAMO KIEV ON WEDNESDAY AND TRIED CONTEXT OF THAT IT'S POSSIBLY THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN A DRAW IN THE LAST SIXTEEN WHERE THEY FELT THEY COULD REACH THE LAST ATE SO PERHAPS THAT'S FOCUS MAGIC'S HAS HAD HIS MIND EVEN FURTHER LET'S LOOK ELSEWHERE THERE WAS ANOTHER FIVE ONE RESULT ON THE DAY WEST HAM WINNING AT BLACKBURN BUT GIVEN TOTTENHAM'S RECENT PREMIER LEAGUE FORM
WELL I SUPPOSE IT COUNTS AS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE THAT THEY WENT DOWN ONE NIL AT HOME TO CRYSTAL PALACE IS MANAGER ELLEN IS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT PREMIER LEAGUE RELEGATION WEST BROM NEXT WEEK AS IMPORTANT AS THIS GAME WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING THERE AND GET OUR LEAGUE FORM BACK ON TRACK
AS I SAID TO THE GUYS YOU KNOW WE COULD STILL GET THE BEST FINISH REVERENT AND PREMIER LEAGUE WE MUST LOSE FOCUS OF WHAT WE ARE WE'RE NOT TOP CLUB YET BUT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS IT FULL OF PALACE CAN STAY CLEAR OF THE RELEGATION ZONE YOU MIGHT THINK THEY'D BE A GOOD BET FOR THE CUP I'LL CERTAINLY AND PARTY HIMSELF HAS HISTORY IN THE F.A. CUP HIMSELF HAVING SCORED THE WINNER IN A CUP SEMI FINAL ONCE AND
HE'S PRODUCED A TEAM ON THERE THEY CAN BE VERY STRONG IN DEFENCE THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL AND QUICK AND ATTACK AND ALMOST THE TEMPLATE FOR WHAT YOU WOULD CALL AN IDEAL CUP TEAM AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS A VERY VERY FINE RESULT YESTERDAY TO GO TO A TEA MIGHT TOTTENHAM HAVE BEEN IN SUCH GREAT FORM LATELY AND WIN EVEN THOUGH PERHAPS HAVING WATCHED THE HIGHLIGHTS LAST NIGHT LOOK MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THEIR SIDE ONCE OR TWICE BUT CERTAINLY AS YOU SAY A GOOD COOK BATS AND A DECENT DRAW AWAY TO READING IN THE LAST EIGHT AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE SHREWSBURY AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED THIS EVENING
TO FEED TONIGHT FOR LORIE VAN HOW SURE SURELY MEANS HIS POSITION BECOMES I'M TERRIBLE ISN'T IT I WOULD THINK SO YES I THINK AFTER THE DEFEAT AT SUNDERLAND THEN THE THE DESK PERFORMANCE IN THE FEET INITIALLY LANDED IN THE EUROPA LEAGUE AWAY LAST WEEK I THINK DEFEAT AGAIN SHREWSBURY
YOU HAVE LOST THREE OF THEIR LAST FOUR MATCHES AT HOME WHO LINED THE BOTTOM FOUR OF LEAGUE ONE IS UNTHINKABLE AND WOULD AS YOU SAY MAKE HIS POSITION UNTENABLE I SUSPECT IN THE LONG TERM WE'VE VANGUARD DOESN'T HAVE A FUTURE AT MANCHESTER UNITED BUT A DEFEAT TONIGHT AGAIN SUCH A LOWLY TEAM AND OFF THE BACK OF SUCH POOR PERFORMANCES IN RESULT I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BRING
MATTERS TO A HEAD AND GIVE MANCHESTER UNITED EVEN MORE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT WHERE THEY GO NEXT FOR ME YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF COURSE COMMENTARY ON THEIR MATCH ON B.B.C.

DAVID CAMERON WILL ADDRESS THE COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT THE CASE FOR REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HE WILL OUTLINE THE DETAILS OF THE DEAL HE AGREED WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS ON FRIDAY AS HE TRIED TO PERSUADE MORE M.P.S TO SUPPORT HIS POSITION LORD LAWSON WHO WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT BRITAIN WOULD HAVE A FAR BETTER FUTURE ECONOMICALLY POLITICALLY IF IT WAS SELF GOVERNING AND INDEPENDENT
THE GOVERNMENT IS BEING URGED TO APPOINT A COMMISSIONER TO ENSURE PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES IN ENGLAND GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO STEPHEN BOB HAS MADE THE CALL A YEAR AFTER HIS REPORT ON THE MISTREATMENT SCANDAL AT THE WINTERBOURNE VIEW CARE HOME IN BRISTOL WHICH WAS EXPOSED BY THE B.B.C.'S PANORAMA PROGRAMME THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED TO SHUT DOWN ALL SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS SO STEPHEN TOLD US HE WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT GOES ON AND THAT THEY MUST CLOSE
AN AMERICAN TAXI DRIVER ACCUSED OF MURDERING SIX PEOPLE IN APPARENTLY RANDOM ATTACKS IN MICHIGAN IS DUE IN COURT LATER JASON DALTON WHO'S FORTY FIVE REPORTEDLY TOOK FARES WHILE CARRYING OUT THE KILLINGS FROM HIS CAB IN KALAMAZOO
HOOPER SAYS IT CARRIED OUT A BACKGROUND CHECK ON HIM WHILE THE POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED HE DID NOT HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD
AT LEAST TWENTY ONE PEOPLE ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE DIED IN THE MOST SEVERE CYCLONE TO HIT FIJI IN LIVING MEMORY OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER OF DEAD WILL RISE AERIAL SURVEYS OF OUTLYING ISLAND SHOW WHOLE VILLAGES HAVE BEEN FLATTENED
THE U.K.'S LARGEST BANK H.S.B.C. SAYS IT'S PRE TAX PROFITS WERE UP ONE PERCENT LAST YEAR AT THIRTEEN POINT TWO BILLION POUNDS THAT'S LOWER THAN ANALYSTS HAD EXPECTED BUT THE BANK SAYS THE RESULTS ARE BROADLY SATISFACTORY AFTER WHAT HE CALLED SEISMIC SHIFTS IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
ONE AND SIX MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.K. CHANGE THEIR ENERGY SUPPLIER LAST YEAR THE INDUSTRY REGULATOR OFGEM SAYS THAT REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ON TWENTY FOURTEEN
TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR BORDERS IF WE VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION DAVID CAMERON HAS SAID STAYING IN MEANS WE WOULD BE SAFE AND STRONGER AND HE SUGGESTED THAT WITHDRAWING COULD JEOPARDISE THE AGREEMENT WITH THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES WHICH ALLOWS U.K. OFFICIALS TO MAKE THEIR IMMIGRATION CHECKS ON THE FRENCH SIDE OF THE BORDER NUMBER TEN SO THAT COULD MEAN THOUSANDS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS ARRIVING ON U.K. SOIL
THAT THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF OPPOSITION POLITICIANS IN FRANCE WHO WOULD LOVE TO TEAR UP THE EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH FRANCE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE OUR BORDERS ON THE SIDE OF THE CHANNEL AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THOSE POLITICIANS ANY EXCUSE TO DO
YESTERDAY THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH ARGUED THAT STAYING IN THE E.U. MAKES BRITAIN MORE VULNERABLE TO PARIS STYLE TERRORIST ATTACKS
THIS OPEN BORDER DOES NOT ALLOW US TO CHECK AND CONTROL PEOPLE THAT MAY COME AND THEY SPEND DON'T WE SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS WHERE THEY SPENT AGES PLANNING AND PLOTTING THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE OPEN BORDER WE HAVE RIGHT NOW MANY OF US FIELD DOES ACTUALLY LEAVE THAT DOOR OPEN AND WE NEED TO SEE THAT RESULT
WELL TONY SMITH IS THE FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE U.K. BORDER FORCE HE'S WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WHAT WOULD CHANGE IF WE PULLED OUT
IT DOES RAISE SIGNIFICANT POLICY AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR THE BORDER FORCE JOHN BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T EXAMINED EUROPEAN PASSPORT HOLDERS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND BY EXAMINATION I MEAN TALKING TO PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THE PURPOSE OF THEIR VISITS SO EUROPEAN PASSPORT HOLDERS NOW MANY OF THEM USE THE GATES THE CHEQUE IS REALLY AN IDENTITY WHAT AND THAT YOU ARE A EUROPEAN OF COURSE IS A WATCH LIST CHECK
IF WE BELIEVE HE IS THEN WE'RE GOING TO RESTRICT MOVEMENT THEN WE COULD IDENTIFY WHAT PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR WHAT YOU SO RIGHT SO IF WE LEAVE THE E.U. EVERYBODY WITH AN E.U. PASSPORT WILL BE TREATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS IF THEY HAD A NIGERIAN PASSPORT OR OR WHATEVER PASSPORT WHEN WILL THEY JOIN I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I'LL ASK HIM WHAT I WHAT I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE AS ONE OF IS POLICY ISSUE THAT I'M SEARCHING FOR THE ARTS OF RHYME IS AN OPERATIONAL
LEADER THAT'S THE LOGIC OF IT IS WHAT I THINK SO BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO FOR NON NATIONALS WE INTERVIEWED SOME OF THEM NEED VISAS WE MAY WELL FIND OURSELVES BUT HE BEATS US BACK ON SOME OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR THE NEED TO GET A VISA BEFORE THEY COME FIRST YOU'RE POLISH I'M GOING OR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE THAT'S WHERE IT IS WHAT IT WAS THAT'S WHERE WE WERE AND THAT'S HOW WE TRADITIONALLY CONTROL OF WHAT WE CALL IMMIGRATION FROM WHAT WE CALL THE COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S A GREATER PRESSURE
TO EMIGRATE WE WILL USE A VISA FOR THIS AND FOR THOSE WELL IT'S NOT LIKE AMERICA AND CANADA WERE THOSE PEOPLE TURN UP AT OUR BORDERS IN THE NON HE LATER THEY'RE INTERVIEWED BY AN OFFICER HOW LONG YOU STAYING FOR WHAT ARE YOU COMING FORM WE STAMPED THE PASSPORT WE AND GIVEN A PERMIT TO STAY FRITTER AND THEN RESIDENCE PERMITS AND SO ON BUT I DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS WITH EUROPEAN SO IF WE'RE GOING TO START DOING THAT THIRTY FOUR MILLION
YOU PASSED ONE OF THOSE FOR THE BORDER FORCE BUDGET'S BEEN CUT YEAR ON YEAR FOR MANY YEARS THAT HUGE PRESSURE ON THE BORDER FORCE BUDGET AND THEIR STRATEGY IS TO AUTOMATE MORE OF THIS SO CLEARLY THE MORE PEOPLE YOU CAN PUT THROUGH GATES THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO INTERVENE I DO THEN YOU HAVE THE MORE EFFICIENT YOU CAN AND VERY QUITE PRESSURE ON QUEUES OF COURSE THERE'S A HUGE PRESSURE ON THE BORDER FORCE TO CLEAR EUROPEAN PASSPORT HOLDERS WERE IN TWENTY FIVE MINUTES
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE LONGER IF WE WILL HAVE TO STOP AND TALK TO THE RIGHT BUT BUT INFINITELY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT IS WHETHER WE WOULD LET IN MORE POTENTIAL TERRORISTS UNDER THE NEW REGIME OUTRAGE IN THE THE PRESENT REGIME AND IT IS THE CASE ISN'T IT IF YOU ARE A TERRORIST AND YOU MANAGED TO GET INTO ANOTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRY YOU CAN COME TO THIS COUNTRY AS YOU'VE JUST EXPLAINED UNQUESTIONED EFFECTIVELY
WELL NOT ENTIRELY UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE ON A LISTED THERE THEN THEN THAT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BUT I MEAN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WITH WITH THE EVIL INTENT AND YOU MANAGED TO GET A EUROPEAN ACCEPTED INTO ANOTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRY YOU CAN GET INTO THIS COUNTRY A LOT EASIER THAN IF YOU WEREN'T DIDN'T HAVE THAN IF WE WERE NOT IN THE OTHER THING IN IT WELL IT DEPENDS WHAT NATIONALITY YOU ARE RUM IN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EUROPEAN
NATIONAL SUCH AS A BELGIAN TERRORIST OR A FRENCH TERRORIST WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE EXCHANGING INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION ON THOSE PEOPLE NOW WE WOULD STILL DO THAT I PRESUME WHETHER WE'RE IN OR OUT HOT UNSURE AND WE WOULD BE TAUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TARGET OF COURSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NON E.U. PASSPORT HOLDER YOU WILL BE EXAMINED AT THE U.K. BOUGHT HER BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PART OF THE SHOW AND YOU KNOW THAT SO OFFICERS WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THOSE PEOPLE NOW I'M TO SEARCH THEIR BAGS BUT WITH THE WORRYING THING ABOUT PARIS
WAS THAT THERE WAS A MIXTURE WASN'T THERE THEY WERE PEOPLE IN IN THAT GROUP THAT WERE EUROPEAN PASSPORT HOLDERS BUT THEY'RE ALSO PEOPLE THAT HAD GOT THROUGH INTO GREECE AS PART OF THE MIGRANT MOVEMENTS AND THAT'S A REAL WORRY BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING SCREENED PROPERLY AND THOROUGHLY ON ENTRY INTO THE E.U. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER WE DO THAT WE ARE THOROUGHLY SCREENING AND CHECKING PEOPLE WHEN THEY ENTER THE UKE RIGHT SO PUTTING ASIDE
COMPLETELY THE POLITICS OF IT YOUR MAIN CONCERN FOR MANY MANY YEARS OBVIOUSLY WAS THE SECURITY OF THE NATION I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S
PRINCIPALLY WHAT MOTIVATED YOU WOULDN'T WE BE SAFER OR
LESS SAFE BUT LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION
I'M NOT SURE TO BE HONEST I'M REALLY NOT SURE ABOUT THAT ONE I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNIST WE HAVE WITH HIM WE HAVE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES TO SHARE DATA AND SHARE INFORMATION AND SHARE INTELLIGENCE WE MUST DO THAT TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE NOW THE HOME SECRETARY HAS SAID THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT OPPORTUNITY
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE A EUROPEANS AREN'T THAT GOOD AT THAT ANY WAY THERE'S A PHONE IF YOU LIKE IN TERMS OF SHARING TOO MUCH DATA ACROSS THERE AND THAT'S WITHIN THE UNION AS IT STANDS SO I THINK WE'D HAVE TO HAVE A COMPLETE RE LOOK AT HOW WE SHARE DATA INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION FOR SECURITY AND CRIMINALITY PURPOSES WHETHER WE'RE IN OR ELSE AND DECIDE WHAT SORT OF ACCESS WE CAN GET TO THAT SISTER BUT THEY COULD IF THEY WISH
SAY WE'RE NOT SHARING WITH YOU AT ALL NOW THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER IN THE EUROPEAN UNION INDEED AND THAT'S THE WORRY I THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK WHAT'S AT THAT'S WHAT THE HOME SECRETARY IS SAYING IS THAT IF WE IF WE ARE OUTSIDE WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITY'S GOING TO BE FOR US TO SHARE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION BUT OF COURSE WE DO THAT WAS AMERICA AND CANADA WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH LOTS OF COUNTRIES WHO WERE IN THE SAME SORT OF POLITICAL SMEAR HIS ARSE ON SECURITY WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT SO MAYBE WE COULD NEGOTIATE SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TONY SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TWENTY TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS WHERE THERE SEEM TO BE UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT ON ONE THING AT LEAST THE BORIS JOHNSON'S DECISION TO JOIN THE OUTER CAMPAIGN IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM IS BIG BIG NEWS YOU ALL RAT BORIS SPELL DO YOU OF COURSE THAT IS THE DAILY MIRROR'S MAIN HEADLINE HE CLAIMS TO DAVID CAMERON'S FURIOUS WITH THEM SEVERAL PAPERS
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS PARTICULARLY AGGRIEVED THAT MISTER JOHNSON INFORMED HIM OF HIS DECISION ONLY NINE MINUTES BEFORE GOING PUBLIC THE INDEPENDENT SUGGEST MISS JOHNSON HAS HIS SIGHTS SET ON NUMBER TEN WITH THE HEADLINE OUT FOR HIMSELF THE GUARDIAN SAYS HE'S DENIED HIS DECISION IS DRIVEN BY AMBITION CALLS IT A SEVERE BLOW TO THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN SAYS HE COULD TRANSFORM THE FORTUNES OF THE LEAVES SIDE THE TIMES AGREED TO THAT SAYS HE'S ELECTRIFIED THE REFERENDUM RACE MY CAMERA
AS THE TIME'S NOW FACES A FORMIDABLE COALITION OF SENIOR CABINET MINISTERS AND UP TO HALF HIS PARLIAMENTARY PARTY CAMPAIGNING AGAINST HIM SO HE SAYS IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK OF A BIGGER BOOST OF THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN THAN NETTING BORIS'S DESERTION OR DAVID CAMERON IS A DISASTER FOR THE TORY LEADER AND THE REST OF THE REMAIN CAMP IT'S GAME ON
THE DAILY EXPRESS IS AMONGST A NUMBER OF PAPERS TO REPORT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM AIR POLLUTION CAUSED BY EVERY DAY ITEMS AND APPLIANCES AT HOME SCHOOLS AND WORKPLACES INCLUDING COOKERS BOILERS FLY SPRAYS CLEANING PRODUCTS AND EVEN AIR FRESHENERS A REPORT BY THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH SUGGEST THAT INDOOR AIR POLLUTION MAY CONTRIBUTE TO NINETY NINE THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR IN EUROPE
RESEARCHERS SAY THE PROBLEM'S BEEN MADE WORSE BY PEOPLE REDUCING VENTILATION IN THEIR HOMES TO IMPROVE INSULATION AND CUT THEIR ENERGY BUILT ACCORDING TO THE SUN CANTEENS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THREE MAIN BUILDINGS IN LONDON SELL THREE THOUSAND WORTH OF SWEETS A MONTHS WHILE ITS OFFICIALS LECTURE OF THE PUBLIC ON OBESITY THE PAPER SAYS THE REVOLUTION THE BREATH OF A SIMPLE EMBARRASS HEALTH CHIEFS CAMPAIGNING WRITS TO SWAP SWEETS FOR FRUIT SPOKESMAN COMPARTMENT SAYS
OUR CANTEENS AND CAFES SELL HEALTHY OPTIONS BUT ON THE SAME PAGE THE PAPER REPORTS THE NUMBER OF UNDER TWELVES WEIGHING MORE THAN FIFTEEN STONE HAS DOUBLED IN A YEAR SOME ELEVEN YEAR OLDS ARE SAYS HER SO OBESE THAT THEY WEIGH MORE THAN HEAVYWEIGHT BOXERS SEVERAL PAPERS REPORT NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT MOBILE PHONES COULD PUT MALE FERTILITY OR RISK AND TIMES EXPLAINS ALL CARRYING THE PHONE IN YOUR TROUSER POCKET IT SAYS KEN
QUOTES COOK SPERM A HARLEY STREET EXPERT TELLS THE PAPER MEN NEED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR WELL BEING AND TRY TO STOP BEING SO ADDICTED TO THEIR PHONES
THAT IS NOT THE ONLY BAD NEWS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY HOT ON THE HEELS OF REVELATIONS THAT SONY EXECUTIVES HAVE GONE BACK TO SENDING FAXES INSTEAD OF EMAILS BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE SECURE THE MALE REPORTS THAT CASSETTE TAPES ARE ROLLING BACK INTO FASHION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC IT'S THE REVIVAL WAS STARTED BY UNDERGROUND MUSIC ALEX BUT NOW MORE MAINSTREAM ARTISTS HAVE STARTED PRODUCING ALBUMS OR CASSETTES AGAIN ONE PRODUCER EXPLAINED IT THIS WAY
THE SETS ARE COMPACT TANGIBLE INSTANT COLLECTABLES AND MUSIC JUST SOUNDS DIFFERENT ON CHEAP WE SAID THAT ABOUT VINYL AND THEN ABOUT RECEIVING THESE YES I THINK THEY ALL GET REVIVED IN THE COLLECTION OF THESE THINGS AT HOME IT IS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND THAT'S NOT PARSLEY TOPS OR TWO EIGHT SIXTY MINUTES TO EIGHT DON'T RUSH AND TALKING OF MUSIC
IF YOU'VE SEEN QUENTIN TARANTINO'S LATEST FILM EIGHT FOR EIGHT YOU WILL RECOGNISE THAT AS THE THEME OF THAT MOVE IT WON A BAFTA LAST WEEK AND HE'S NOMINATED IN NEXT SUNDAY'S OSCARS AS WELL IT IS OF COURSE
A WESTERN AND THE MUSIC BY THE ITALIAN COMPOSER ENNIO MORRICONE IS REMIND YOU OF COURSE HAVE THE MUSIC THAT HE ALSO RATE FOR THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY WITH THOSE FAMOUS ECHOEY TWANGS
WESTERN MOVING T. V. THINGS BY THE LIKES OF MORRICONE Y. AS WELL AS JOHN BARRY AND ELMER BERNSTEIN WILL BE CELEBRATED IN A NEW SHOW AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL NEXT MONTH SO WE ASKED FRONT ROW PRESENTER SIR MIRROR AHMED TO GIT DEEP AND DOWN AND EXPLAIN THEIR APPEAL
ONE OF THE KEY GENRES OF THE WESTERN THEME IS THE STORYTELLING BALLET IMITATE AN OLD FOLK SONG OFTEN HAS AN ELEMENT OF ANONYMITY BUT IT MIGHT ALSO TALK ABOUT AND NAMED A VILLAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SHOOT FRANK MILLER DAD AND THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS
HIS HIGH NOON BUT DO NOT FORSAKE ME O. MY DARLING AND THAT SONG MAKES
HE WAS
THERE'S MORE
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE VERY LUSH ROMANTIC SCORE ESPECIALLY IN THE GOLDEN DAYS OF HOLLYWOOD IN THE FORTIES AND EARLY FIFTIES WHICH IS CREATING THEM THE ONLY MYTHOLOGY OF THE WESTERN SO SHANE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE IT'S VERY ROMANTIC HE HAS HE HAS HIS OWN THEME IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMETHING FROM WAGNER'S HAD BEEN THAT KIND OF TRISTAN IT'S GREAT
HERO ON A MISSION AND IT CREATES SOME OF THE MOST ENDURING AND DIFFICULT
OF THE WEST INCLUDING THE IDEA OF A GOOD MAN WITH A GOOD TOOL A GUN BEING INHERENTLY A GOOD TOOL
PRESENCE OF INDIANS IN MOVIE SCHOOLS OR OTHER NATIVE AMERICANS AS WE SHOULD SAY MOVIE SCHOOLS IS NOW QUITE PROBLEMATIC AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY'RE THE ONES WE REALLY REMEMBER WHICH IS
SOUND OF DRUMS AND THERE'S A GREAT HINT OF DARKNESS OF MENACE IS OFTEN A MINOR TUNE TO HOLD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCHERS HAS A GREAT ONE THE ROMANCE AND ALSO THE THE VILLAINY OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DON'T PAY THEM ANY MORE BECAUSE WE FEEL THEY REPRESENT THE WHOLE PROBLEMATIC WAY IN WHICH WE VIEW THE NATIVE AMERICAN
THE T. V. SCORES OF WESTERNS ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY HAVE IN A WAY A MORE ENDURING IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE REPETITION BUT RAWHIDE IS A REALLY UNUSUAL CASE BECAUSE ITS PRESENT
IN OUR COLLECTIVE MEMORY I THINK IS MOSTLY BECAUSE IT WAS USED IN THE BLUES BROTHERS WHERE IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM IT'S USED AN ENTIRELY IRONIC WAY BECAUSE THE BAND HAVE COME TO PLAY RHYTHM AND BLUES BUT THEY'RE IN A REDNECK BAR AND THEY HAVE TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT WILL PREVENT THEM GETTING LYNCHED SO THEY PLAY RAWHIDE AND IT RIDICULOUSLY MATCH IT HAS A WHIP CRACKING IT AND EVERYTHING BUT THAT ALSO LEADS ON TO WHY
THE MOST FAMOUS WESTERN THEMES ON SPAGHETTI WESTERNS WHICH ARE FULL OF THE SOUNDS OF WHIP CRACKS WHISTLES AND THE CLANGING OF METAL BELLS STRANGE ANIMAL COOL START TO APPEAR IN THEM AND THEN CHANTING WHICH IS SORT OF TRIBAL IT HINTS AT THE PRESENCE OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN BUT CRUCIALLY THEY ARE ULTRA MACHO BECAUSE IT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO WALK AROUND THE ICE CREAM IT UP PRETEND TO BE CLINT EASTWOOD YEAH
THERE'S THE BOMBASTIC FILM SCORE WHICH KIND OF HAD ITS PEAK IN THE LATE FIFTIES OFTEN WITH A BIG CINEMASCOPE WIDESCREEN FORMAT VERY AARON COPELAND ASKED BIG SOARING STRINGS CRUSHING BRASS AND THE BEST OF THESE PROBABLY THE BEST WESTERN SCORE IN MY OPINION IS ELMER BERNSTEIN'S THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS WHEN YOU THINK IT'S BOMBASTIC IT'S ACTUALLY
HASN'T IT'S ABOUT LITTLE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FAILED BY THE AMERICAN STATE AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SO IT'S A FILM ABOUT THE TRIUMPH OF THE LITTLE MAN AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES
WHAT A TUNE TERRIFIC STUFF THERE IT IS NOW TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY IT IS TENDERLY THEREFORE SPEAKER IN A GLASGOW STUDIO THIS MORNING IS JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY MORNING JOHN MORNING JOHN WHOEVER ELSE TS THE NEWS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS ILLUSTRATED ONE THING IS VERY IMPRESSIVE ABILITY OF FORD AND POLITICIANS TO SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE
I WASN'T ONE DAY IN RAPT ATTENTION WHILE PAUL THIS GOVERNMENT MINISTER SPOKEN HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED ENGLISH USING COMPLEX SENTENCE CONSTRUCTIONS AND MADE ME WONDER HOW MANY BRITISH PARLIAMENTARIANS HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES AS FLUENT IN A SECOND LANGUAGE
OF COURSE AS SOMETHING WE'VE COME TO EXPECT TWICE IN THE LAST FORTNIGHT I HAD TO STAY OVERNIGHT IN A LONDON HOTEL ON EACH OCCASION THERE WERE TWO RECEPTIONISTS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT NATIONS YET ALL ABLE TO SPEAK AND EVEN JOKE AND ENGLISH WITH GREAT EASE
OR TRY TO REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LAST IN THE HOTEL A BROAD WHERE THERE WAS A BRITISH RECEPTIONIST WITH SUCH AN ENVIABLE COMMAND OF THE LOCAL LINGO
SO THEY'LL BE EXPECT THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SPEAK ENGLISH AS AT THAT WE HAVE NEVER BEEN CONVINCED OF THE VALUE OF HAVING A SECOND LANGUAGE VOCABULARY
AS A NATION WHICH INCREASINGLY RELIES ON TOURISM AS A SOURCE OF INCOME ONE WOULD THINK THAT ENCOURAGING HER OWN YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE FLUENT IN SPANISH A ARE NOT ARABIC MAY BE PREFERABLE TO RELYING ON FOREIGN NATIONALS TO SAVE THIS A TOURIST INDUSTRY
WHEN SOME YEARS AGO THE JAPANESE THEOLOGIAN COURSE A KICKER YAMA ADDRESSED AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT GATHERING IN EDINBURGH HE SPOKE OF HOPE WHEN HE MOVED TO THE U.S. SEE HE PHONED A DISQUIETING TO GO TO A CHURCH WE HAD GOD WAS ADDRESSED IN AMERICAN ENGLISH RATHER BENCH AT THAT RATHER THAN A JAPANESE
BUT THEN HE HAD A MOMENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH LED HIM TO REALISE THAT IN HIS WORDS THE MOTHER TONGUE GOD HE'S TOO SMALL
THERE WERE TWENTY GAUGE WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARED HIS FAITH BUT ARTICULATED THAT AND A LANGUAGE NOT HIS OWN THAT HE'D REALISED THAT GOD WAS BIGGER THAN HIS NATION BIGGER THAN HIS CHURCH BIGGER THAN HIS THEOLOGY
I ENDORSE THAT FULLY WHETHER IT HAS BEEN WORKING ABROAD OR ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE FROM OTHER CONTINENTS ELEVEN AND BRITAIN HAVE ALWAYS PHONE MUD ALLEGES PRESUMPTIONS CHALLENGED AS THE GOD WHO SEEM SO MUCH AT HOME AN ENGLISH AS REVEALED TO HAVE NO FEVER MOTHER TONGUE
AND QUITE APART FROM RELIGION WHEN I'VE PLUCKED UP THE CONFIDENCE TO REST GETTING THINGS WRONG AND ATTEMPTING TO SPEAK FRENCH OR DUTCH I'M ALWAYS AMAZED AT HOW NATIVE SPEAKERS BECOME MORE OPEN AND ENCOURAGING WHEN THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A NATION LANGUAGE AND CULTURE ARE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK ALL THIS OF HOW ADVANTAGEOUS IT IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH AND MORE A FAUX PRESUMPTIOUS AS TO THINK THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD BE LIKE I WAS
BURNS WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE JOHN BELL OF THE IONA COMMUNITY TIME NELL IS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT
THE TALK OF CEASEFIRES THEIR HOPES FOR PEACE TALKS OVER THE FUTURE OF SYRIA TURNED OUT TO BE JUST THAT TALK
AND HOPE THE CITIES OF OMS HOMES AND DAMASCUS HAD BEEN HIT BY A WAVE OF BOMBINGS CARRIED OUT BY THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE WAS PRESIDENT ASSAD'S CONTINUE TO GAIN TERRITORY WITH THE SUPPORT OF RUSSIAN
SO IS THE DIPLOMACY JUST PROVING TO BE A COVER FOR MILITARY GAINS FOR VARIOUS SIDES IN THIS CONFLICT I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO EVELYN FORECASTS WHO WAS UNTIL LAST YEAR THE U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE
WE ARE ON THIS MERRY GO ROUND A COUPLE OF TIMES ALREADY AND I'M AFRAID THAT
I CAN'T BE PERSONALLY MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC NOW I MEAN I HOPE THAT SECRETARY CARRIERS CLOSER TUE AS HE SAID
NEGOTIATING A CEASEFIRE BUT I'M AFRAID THAT THERE'S VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW FOR FOR ANY HELP
TO USE YOUR METAPHOR OF THE MERRY GO ROUND ON THE PEOPLE WITH SMILES ON THEIR FACES ON THAT MERRY GO ROUND PRESIDENT AS SAD AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON THE GROUND AS THE WEST TALKS ABOUT TALKS
YES THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY THE ONE SMILING AND YOU KNOW THIS IS KIND OF A THIS IS A THIS IS A TACTIC WE'VE SEEN FROM RUSSIA BEFORE SO ABOUT A YEAR AGO
WITH THIS VERY THING HAPPENED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MINSTER NEGOTIATIONS WHERE THE RUSSIAN SAID WE WERE LIKE WE WOULD LIKE TO CALL A CEASEFIRE BUT IN TWO DAYS I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT A DAY OR TWO AND THEY SAID WE WILL CEASE FIRING AND IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE THEY QUICKLY MARKED UP THAT MILITARY OPERATION THAT THEY HAD INITIATED
AND MADE SURE THAT THE BATTLEFIELD WAS TO THEIR LIKING MEN WENT TO THE NEGOTIATING HERE WHAT'S THE DEAL SO SO THE AIM OF THIS TRIED AND TRUE METHOD FOR THE HAM AND THE AIM OF THIS WAS TO STRENGTHEN HER SAD TO PUT POD POSSIBLY MAKE GAINS IN ALEPPO BUT IN THE LONGER TERM TO SAY A SAD IS SOMEONE YOU NEED TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU CAN NO LONGER SAY HE'S GOT TO GO
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I LOOK FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING RUSSIA AND THIS ONE VERY CLOSELY A LONG THERE'S BEEN NO QUESTION
THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO KEEP A SAD AND POWER AND THEY'RE A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT THEY STEM FROM THE OVERALL RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES YOU KNOW NOT TO SEE THESE DICTATORS BEING FOISTED OWL BY OUTSIDE INTERVENTION OF COURSE THEY'RE THERE THEY'RE BEING VOICED BY THEIR PEOPLE IN PART
NOT TO SEE ANY TO REWRITE THE INTERNATIONAL RULES OF THE ROAD SO AND OF COURSE TO KEEP POWER BECAUSE HE SEES THIS KIND OF OUTSIDE MILITARY INTERVENTION TO REMOVE IT DESPITE A DICTATOR AS SOMETHING VERY POTENTIALLY PERSONAL TO HIM
YOU WORK FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT THE PRESIDENT'S DEEP UNWILLINGNESS TO GET ENGAGED IN THIS DISPUTE IN ITS VERY EARLY DAYS REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOW LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES
I THINK THAT THE KEY HERE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE NEED LOVERIDGE ARMOUR THE RUSSIANS IN ORDER TO GET AN AGREEMENT SO WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MILITARY FORCE OR SOME OTHER MEANS BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE SANCTIONS WE COULD CONSIDER SANCTIONING RUSSIA WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SYRIA
TO SAY GOINGS ON AROUND MIDDLE EASTERN ALLIES TO WORK TOGETHER WITH US AND OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES WERE ALREADY YOU'RE THANKING RUSSIA UKRAINE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS MAYBE WE COULD THINK ABOUT BUT CERTAINLY ON THE MILITARY SIDE I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO PRESS FORWARD AND ARTHUR I'M NOT GOING TO LET HER GAPE THE PAST AND WHEN YOU SAY IN THE MILITARY SIDE WE NEED TO PRESS FORWARD IN WHAT WAY WELL I THINK WE CLEARLY NEED TO DE SUPPORTING THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION AND IF WE CAN
WE'VE WITH OUR SUPPORT AND SO WHILE WE YOU KNOW UNTIL WE GET A NEGOTIATED OUTCOME THAT IS TOO YOU KNOW THAT SATISFIES US AS WELL AS THE RUSSIANS AND THE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON ASAD AND THE RUSSIANS AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION
AND THAT MEANS MILITARILY AS WELL ISN'T THE LESSON OF UKRAINE THOUGH THAT WE TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL IN OTHER WORDS WE LOSE INTEREST IN IT AND IN THE SPACE THAT HE'S CREATED PRESIDENT PUTIN ONCE AGAIN GET STRONGER
FRANK WE WERE COOLING DOES VERY WELL IN IT AS YOU MENTION HE SURPRISES US HEAT HE TAKES THE SOUTH BOUNCY DOES THIS KIND OF JUDO TRICK YOU KNOW WHICH IS TIPPED TO LASH OUT TO USE AS MILITARY SOMEWHERE WE'RE NOT EXPECTING HIM TO YOU ONCE WE'RE OFF BALANCE AND THEN AND THEN HE'S ALSO THE POKER PLAYER SO HE'LL TAKE RISKS IN DOING THAT AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE WE WEREN'T EXPECTING HIM WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WE IN THE WEST
EVEN FARKUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING

EVERYONE SAYS IT WAS A MASSIVE BLOW TO THE YES CAMP AT THOSE FOUR MONTHS TO GO BEFORE WE VOTE IN THE END PRESUMABLY IT WILL BE THE ARGUMENTS RATHER THAN THEIR PERSONALITIES THAT WILL SWAY US ONE ARGUMENT THAT HAS ALREADY EMERGED STRONGLY IS OVER WHAT HAPPENS TO THE NATION'S SECURITY IF WE KNEW BUT I'M JOINED BY THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING BEFORE WE GET THERE BORIS JOHNSON A BIG BLOW NO I KNOW THAT WAS EXPECTED
NO ANYTHING TO IS PARTICULARLY SURPRISED BY THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS IT'S A MATTER OF JUDGEMENT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE OF THE CABINET HAD DECIDED TO BACK THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE SPECIAL DEAL HE'S GOT BACK FROM BRUSSELS AND BORIS HAS TAKEN THE OPPOSITE VIEW BUT IN THE END EACH OF US HAS A VERGE AS YOU'VE JUST SAID IT'S NOT WITCH WITCH WAGE CABINET MINISTER GOES EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN HAS A VOTE THAT'S WHAT WE PROMISED AND A MANIFESTO I WAS SO THERE HAVE BEEN SO KEEN TO GET BORIS JOHNSON ON THE SIDE
OBVIOUSLY HE WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE SUPPORT FROM BORIS BUT HE'S TAKEN HIS INDIVIDUAL VIEW AND IT'S UP TO EACH CITIZEN EVERY EACH ONE OF US TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT AS TO WHETHER WE ARE SAFER AND STRONGER INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR WHETHER WE SHOULD TAKE CARE WHAT IS A BIG GAMBLE AND LEAVE TO A RATHER UNCERTAIN FUTURE WOULD COME TO THAT IN A MOMENT BUT JUST STAYING WITH THE POLITICS OF IT FOR A MOMENT IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT HISTORY TELLS US THAT THIS DOESN'T IT IT'S GOING TO BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR DAVID CAMERON TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TOGETHER AFTER THIS REFERENDUM ALMOST WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES TO SEE HIM ARGUING PERHAPS ON A STAGE AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL AND BORIS JOHNSON AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SIT IN THE CUPBOARD AND SAY RIGHT WE'RE ALL MATES TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THE VOTE WENT THIS WAY OR THAT WAY DIFFICULT ISN'T IT AT THE CABINET MEETING ON SATURDAY THAT WAS BEFORE THE DEBATE BUT FOR THE DEBATE EVEN THOSE WHO WANT TO LEAVE MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN
AFTER THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND CONTINUE THE PROGRAMME AND INDEED UP UNTIL THEY'VE UP UNTIL THE REFERENDUM ITSELF THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE GEORGE OSBORNE WILL BE DELIVERING HIS BUDGET WILL BE CONTINUING OUR PROGRAMME OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORM WORKING TOGETHER AS COLLEAGUES AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HISTORY IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REVS AND DOOM AND I FEAR I AM OLD ENOUGH TO TO REMEMBER THE THEN WILSON GOVERNMENT CAME TOGETHER AFTER THE REFERENDUM ALL THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS STRENGTHENED IF YOU RECALL BUT THE PARTY DIDN'T STAY TOGETHER DID IT THERE WAS A SEVERE SPRIT OR MAYBE THAT WAS PART OF A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WAS PART OF IT ONLY ENDED UP WITH E.S.T. PEOPLE AND THE PARTY STAYED TOGETHER RIGHT THROUGH THAT THAT PARLIAMENT THINK THERE WERE OTHER FAULT LINES IN THE PARTY BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT LOOK WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE DISAGREEMENTS THE PRIME MINISTER I THINK TO HIS CREDITORS ALLOWING MEMBERS OF THE CABINET TOO
DISSENT IS ALLOWING TORY M.P.S TO TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW HE'S ALLOWING THAT BUT AT THE END WHEN IT'S ALL OVER AND THE VOTES HAVE BEEN COUNTED YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND CONTINUE THE PROGRAMME THAT WE GOT ALL RIDE ON LAST YEAR WE WILL BE STRONGER AND SAFER IF WE STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SAYS MY CAMERA WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE NATION WILL BE AT GREATER RISK IF WE LOSE
WELL AT THE MOMENT A DEFENCE A SECURITY RESTS ON NATO NOT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT THE EUROPEAN UNION ADDS TO THAT SECURITY AND THERE'S NO I DON'T KNOW ANY MEMBER OF NATO THAT WANTS US TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN DO THINGS NATO CAN'T FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO PERSUADE THE REST OF EUROPE TO APPLY SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA
TO AFTER THE ANNEXATION OF THE CRIMEA AND IT'S INTERFERENCE IN THE UKRAINE NATO COULDN'T DO THAT IT WAS THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT APPLIED SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN LEGALLY TO GET THEM TO ABANDON THE CIVIL NUCLEAR PROGRAMME IT'S THROUGH THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU EXCHANGE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND PASSENGER INFORMATION JUST STAY WITH HER MOTHER TOGETHER ON COUNTER TERRORISM ALSO THE EUROPEAN UNION
ADDS IT'S NOT HOLY ART SECURITY OF COURSE THAT'S NATO BUT IT COMPLEMENTS THE SECURITY WE HAVE IN THE WEST ALL RIGHT TAKE THOSE ONE AT A TIME RUSSIA YOU COULD WELL ARGUE CAN DO AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT THE E. U.
PARTLY GOT US INTO THE MATHS WITH THE UKRAINE BY PUSHING FOR EVER CLOSER RELATIONS WITH UKRAINE NO I I WOULDN'T ARGUE THAT IT WAS FOR A UKRAINE TO CHOOSE ITS OWN PARTICULAR FUTURE AND IT WAS RUSSIA WHO STOPPED IT PLAYED NO PART IN IT WELL THE OPINION OF THE UKRAINE WANTED A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WAS ENTITLED TO ASK FOR IT RUSSIA SHOULDN'T HAVE A VETO OVER UKRAINE'S FUTURE BUT THE BIG POINT HERE IS THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY SANCTIONS AT ALL AGAINST RUSSIA
IF A BRITAIN HADN'T LED THE CHARGE AND SAID RUSSIA SHOULD PAY A PRICE AND B. IF THERE HADN'T BEEN A MECHANISM FOR DOING IT WHICH THERE WASN'T IN IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT LEGALLY YOU CAN IMPOSE A TRADE BAN AGAINST RUSSIA AND YOU COULDN'T DO THAT IF WE WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT TERRORISTS COMING IN AND THE FORMER BOSS OF INTERPOL YOU'LL KNOW THIS MY NOBLE WROTE
JUST THE OTHER DAY WELL AFTER THEIR PARENTS ATTACKS THAT THE E. USE INTERNAL BORDERS POLICY AND I'M QUOTING HIM WAS LIKE HANGING A SIGN WELCOMING TERRORISTS TO EUROPE YOU WANT TO STAY IN THAT ARRANGEMENT WE'RE NOT IN THAT ARRANGEMENT NO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT THAT IS THE
ECT INNOCENT IT WITH GREAT RESPECT JOHN IT ISN'T WE'RE ALREADY OUTSIDE THAT WE CONTROL HER OUTSIDE SHOWING WE'RE OUTSIDE YOU DON'T CENTRAL THE WAY SHAMED IN THE WORK THAT'S WHERE OUTSIDE DUKE YOU CAN'T COME INTO THIS COUNTRY UNLESS YOU HAVE A PROPER PASSPORT OR VISA AND THAT IS CHECKED BEFORE YOU COME IN NOW IN EUROPE OF COURSE AT THE MOMENT THOSE WERE IN SHOWING THEM OF COURSE THEY CAN WALK ACROSS THEIR BORDERS BUT WE'RE OUTSIDE THAT AND ONE OF THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE RENEGOTIATION THERE DAVID CAMERON HAS CONDUCTED IS THAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO
OF THIS KIND OF SPECIAL STATUS WE'RE NOT INSIDE THE SINGLE CURRENCY WE'RE NOT INSIDE THE BORDALOO ARE SHOWING IN AREA WE HAVE BETTER PROTECTION FOR A PARLIAMENT AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE KEEP IT THAT WAY BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET INTO THIS COUNTRY
WE'D STILL BE ABLE TO CHECK WATCH THIS WOULDN'T WE WHETHER WE'RE IN OR OUT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RELY FOR EXAMPLE ON THE EXCHANGE OF CRIMINAL RECORDS THROUGH THE EUROPEAN NOT SURE YOU CAN'T BE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT WELL YOU CAN TAKE THE EVIDENCE OF PEEP FORMER DIRECTOR GENERAL OF M.I.FIVE SIR JONATHAN EVANS WHAT ABOUT THE GENERAL THE U.K. BORDER FORCE TONY SMITH HAD HIM ON HALF AN HOUR AGO AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY RELUCTANT DOES IT STANDS TO GIVE US A LOT OF INFORMATION
OF COURSE WE DO BUT WE DEPEND ON THEIR CO OPERATION AGAINST COUNTERTERRORISM THEY'D CERTAINLY BE MORE RELUCTANT IF WE WEREN'T PART OF THIS AT ALL NOW IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS AND THERE ARE EXTRA SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE OF COURSE FROM THE FURTHER PROTECTION THAT DAVID CAMERON WON LAST WEEK AGAINST MIGRANTS CLAIMING BENEFITS IN THIS COUNTRY SOVEREIGNTY IF YOU WON'T LISTEN TO WHAT
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT SOREL HE IS LANGUAGES HE TOLD ANDREW MARR YESTERDAY IF WE LEAVE THE YOU THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU A FEELING OF SOLIDARITY BUT IT WOULD BE AN ILLUSION OF SOVEREIGNTY THE RALOO MEANING OF SOVIET HE WAS THE ABILITY TO GET THINGS DONE
YES AND I THINK THAT THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF IT OF COURSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE BRITAIN TO HAVE THIS NOT SIMPLY THE ILLUSION THE FACT OF BEING A SELF GOVERNING NATION AGAIN THAT OUR PARLIAMENT AND COURTS ABSOLUTELY SUPREME AND SO ON BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS THIS THAT IF YOU GOT BACK TO THAT KIND OF GOLDEN AGE WHERE OUR PARLIAMENT WAS
ABSOLUTELY SOVEREIGN YOU WOULD STILL HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION NEXT DOOR HE WOULD STILL HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TAKING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR TRADE AND OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR WAY OF LIFE AND THE ARGUMENT IS THIS ISN'T IT BETTER TO STILL BE THERE HOWEVER FRUSTRATING IT IS AT THE TABLE SHAPING THOSE REGULATIONS LEADING EUROPE IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT PROTECTING YOUR NATIONAL INTERESTS OR SHOULD YOU GO OUT AND PURSUE THIS ILLUSION OF SEPARATE SOVEREIGNTY
ALL ON YOUR OWN WITHOUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND ALLIANCE ACCEPT THAT HELP HER SHAPE THE REST OF THE WAR THAT BORIS JOHNSON IS RIGHT ISN'T HE WHEN HE SAYS IT'S THE INABILITY OF PEOPLE TO KICK
AND INABILITY OF PEOPLE PER KICK EM PEAS OUT AT ELECTIONS THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CONTROL THEIR LIVES THAT IS WHAT THE CONVENTIONAL DEFINITION OF SOB AND I'M GOING TO STOP AND THAT IS NOT BEING UNDERMINED THEY DID KICK UP BUT THEY DID KICK TO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX EXERCISE SOVEREIGNTY THIS IS JUNE JOHN IN THIS GREAT REFERENDUM THAT IS THE BEST PROOF THAT WE STILL RETAIN A SOVEREIGNTY AND WE CAN GO ON DOING THAT WHAT IS IT
IT'S AN ILLUSION OF SOVEREIGNTY TO THINK THAT SIMPLY SELF GOVERNING STATUS AND DO PARLIAMENT HAVING HAVING THIS SUPREME CONTROL ON ITS OWN ACTUALLY DELIVERS THE KIND OF INFLUENCE AND CONTROL THAT BRITAIN NEEDS IN THE WORLD EXCEPT THAT WHEN MICHAEL GO SAYS EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE MINISTER IS TOLD I UNDERSTAND BUT I'M AFRAID THAT'S AGAINST THE E.U. RULES THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOVEREIGNTY DOES IT
OF COURSE IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH TWENTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR POINT OF VIEW WHEN YOU'RE TRADING WITH THE REST OF EUROPE YOU NEED TO SHAPE REGULATIONS IN BRITAIN'S INTEREST AND YOU NEED TO ARGUE FOR THEM BUT THE POINT IS THIS IS THAT IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY INFLUENCE AT ALL AND THE EUROPEAN UNION LIKE IT OR NOT AND IT HAS MANY FAULTS NOBODY LIKES COMMISSIONERS OR HARMONISATION
DIRECTIVES HAVE AS MANY FAULTS BUT IF YOU WERE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WOULD STILL BE THERE IT WOULD STILL BE AFFECTING UP KNOWING THE FIRST OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE WOULD JUST BE A PATHETIC LITTLE OFFSHORE ISLAND WITH NO HIM NO I WILL I'M NOT ARGUING THAT IT'S A BIT LIKE IT NO I'M NOT ARGUING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE OF COURSE NOT WHERE THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE COULD CERTAINLY MAKE A GO OF IT
ON OUR OWN BUT AROUND JUST UNDER HALF OUR TRADE IS WITH THE EUROPEAN KNEW HIM WE NEED THE COLLECTIVE WEIGHT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH RUSSIAN AGGRESSION OR WITH TERRORISM YOU NEED TO BE PART OF THESE BIG PARTNERSHIPS OR ALLIANCES WE'RE PART OF NATO THAT'S FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES IT'S A BUREAUCRACY WE'RE PART OF THE UNITED NATIONS WE DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO SO YOU'VE GOT A NATION GOING ON OUR OWN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID AS I UNDERSTOOD THAT'S RIGHT ISN'T IT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR PURPOSES IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR BRITAIN
TO SURVIVE ON ITS OWN BEING ARGUMENT THOUGH HE'S ALWAYS STRONGER AND SAFER BY GOING ON OUR OWN OR STICKING INSIDE A EUROPEAN UNION AND TRYING TO SHAPE IT NOW WERE ONE OF THE BIG COUNTRIES INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE SPECIAL STATUS THAT DAVID CAMERON HAS NOW ACHIEVED FOR US GIVING A PARLIAMENT MORE PROTECTION PROTECTING OUR BUSINESSES PROTECTING THE POSITION OF STIRLING AND PROTECTING OUR BORDERS AGAINST
BENEFIT DRIVEN MIGRATION THAT SPECIAL STATUS SEEMS TO ME ACTUALLY TO GIVE US THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS MICHAEL FALLON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU AND LET'S TURN TO LAURA BUT IT WAS A POLITICAL EDITOR DAVID CAMERON'S POSITION LAURA
WELL FOR DAVID CAMERON I THINK HE'S IN A BIG BOLD NEW PHASE LIKE EVERYBODY IN POLITICS THIS HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY FORTY EIGHT HOURS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE NUDGES HINTS AND WHISPERS OF THIS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS NOW JOHN BUT NOW IT IS HERE AND CABINET MINISTERS ARE NOW OUT IN THE OPEN DISAGREEING WITH EACH OTHER THE PRIME MINISTER WILL HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THIS AFTERNOON SEEING PHYSICALLY I SUPPOSE THE PEOPLE ON HIS OWN BENCHES WHO OPPOSED
OF COURSE GETTING A SENSE OF HOW MUCH SUPPORT HE'LL GET ON HIS OWN SIDE TOO AND I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE IN ALL OF THIS THERE'S A SENSE OF LIBERATION VERY STRUCK WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH IAIN DUNCAN SMITH YESTERDAY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE SAID IS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT EUROPE FOR TEN YEARS YOU KNOW FOR THE TORY PARTY IT'S A BIT LIKE TAKING A CORK OUT OF A BOTTLE
THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOW ALL THERE I THINK LIKE WE HEARD WITH MICHAEL FALLON THEY'RE ONE OF THE CURIOUS THINGS ABOUT DAVID CAMERON'S POSITION IS THROUGHOUT THIS NEGOTIATION HE'S DEFINED HIMSELF AS A CRITIC OF BRUSSELS HE'S BEEN SAYING I DON'T LIKE THIS ABOUT YOU I DON'T LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU THAT'S WHY I WANT TO CHANGE IT AND HAVE A NEW AND IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BUT NOW NO ENTHUSIAST FOR IT BUT HE HAS TO PERSUADE US
BUT IT'S WORTH STAYING IN WHICH IS QUITE A STRANGE THING IN CAMPAIGNING TERMS BECAUSE LIKE EVERY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER ALMOST DEFINED HIMSELF AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION YOU KNOW TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FRUSTRATIONS BUT NOW HE HAS TO BE A POSITIVE AND LOOK AT FOR STAYING IN EVEN THOUGH BY HIS OWN ADMISSION JUST AS WE HEARD MICHAEL FALLON THERE HE FINDS IT FRUSTRATION FRUSTRATING AND FINDS VERY BIG PROBLEMS WITH IT TO LAURA MANY THANKS
HE'S TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT HE FLEW FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DIFFERENT AIRCRAFT HE CRASHED TWENTY THREE TIMES HE WAS THERE FOR THE INTERROGATION OF HERMANN GOERING HE WAS THERE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AS THE R.A.F. SO MOST DECORATED FIGHTER PILOTS
CAPTAIN ERIC WINKLE BROWN DIED YESTERDAY AGE NINETY SEVEN HIS CAREER WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT OF ADVENTURE OF DARING BUT IT ALSO SHOWED HIM THE DEPTHS TO WHICH HUMANITY COULD SINK THIS IS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HORROR THAT HE FOUND WHEN HE VISITED THE BERGEN BELSEN CONCENTRATION CAMP I NEVER CHANGED THAT SHIT
DESECRATION OF HUMAN BEINGS WHEN WE WERE IN GENERAL PILES OF BODIES AND HIRES THE ROOF THEY WERE MOSTLY FEMALE
JEWISH LAD SHE'S A CAMP WHERE FEMALE THEY WEREN'T BULL YELLOWS JEN WAS A BALD URGENT LITTLE CAT POSITIONS
THIS TENCH WAS UTTERLY UTTERLY A POOR
ORDINARILY POWERFUL FIRST WITNESS THERE HE TAUGHT THOUGH WITH THESE JOY TO THE JOY OF HIS LIFELONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH FLYING ON THERE AND HE DID IT ON THE THREE THOUSAND EDITION OF DESERT ISLAND DISC RECORDED A COUPLE OF YEARS
FLYING TAKES YOUR LIFE OVER REALLY IF YOU'RE REALLY GET AIRCRAFT THAT YOU BUTTON TO PUSH
THEN YOU ARE FUEL ONE DISH THAT'S NOT YOU PLAYING THERE'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU WELL WE'RE JOINED BY THE MILITARY HISTORIAN PAUL BE VERY WAS FRIENDS WITH CAPTAIN BROWN FOR FORTY YEARS AND THE EDITOR OF SURREY DOWNS MAGAZINE EMILY HORTON WHO INTERVIEWED THE VETERAN JUST TWO WEEKS AGO NOT LONG AFTER SHE FIRST MET HIM AND EXTRAORDINARY MAN PAUL BEAVER
TOTALLY I MEAN IT'S JUST YOU RUN OUT OF SUPERLATIVES VERY QUICKLY WITH ERIC HAD A GREAT MAN AND I HAVE TO SAY OF COURSE THE MOST DECORATED ROYAL NAVY FIGHTER PILOT NOT NOT NOT A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE ARE IMPORTANT THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT HE DID TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN DECK LANDINGS HE'S THE MAN WHO DEVELOPED THE SKILLS
SET THAT PEOPLE STILL USED TODAY FOR LANDING AEROPLANES ON AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THAT'S THE TEST PILOTS HIS CHECKLIST ARE STILL USED BY THE EMPIRE TEST PILOT SCHOOL AT BOSCOMBE DOWN AND HE'S TALKED TO MILLIONS OF TEST PILOTS AROUND THE WORLD AND IN THE LAST WHAT SEVENTY YEARS SO EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WAS JUST AMAZING AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS IN FORTY YEARS
I STILL FOUND THINGS OUT AND ONLY FOUND OUT TWO MONTHS AGO THAT HE HAD BEEN A WALL OF DEATH RIDER WHERE HERE WAS BOSS USED TO GO AROUND THE WALL OF DEATH
WITH A LION AND NOW THIS IS JUST FOR ME IS JUST MIND BOGGLING HIS BOSS USED TO HELP THE LION ON HIS BACK ERIC USED TO SOMETIMES GO ROUND WITH THE LION IN A SIDECAR IN THERE ON THE WALL OF DEATH AND YOU JUST THINK WHAT ELSE DID DIDN'T THIS MAN DO YOU KNOW HE DOES EVERY EVERY DAY THAT I SPOKE TO HIM AND IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS I'VE SEEN HIM ALMOST DAILY
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE A NEW DISCO ERIC WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT SINCE PAUL THAT THIS WAS A MAN WHO LIKE MANY OF HIS GENERATION DIDN'T ACTUALLY SHARE BOTH THE HORROR AND SOME OF THE JOY OF THAT WARTIME PAST IT WAS SOMETHING YOU KEPT QUIET UNTIL THE LAST YEARS OF THEIR LIFE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY WANT TO OPEN UP TO TELL THEIR STORIES TO SHARE WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED WHAT IF YOU LOOK AT HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHIES CUPID IT'S VERY TECHNICAL IT'S ABOUT FLYING GERMAN JETS ARE ABOUT FLYING EARLY NAVAL AIRCRAFT IT IT'S
IT IS IF YOU LIKE VERY CONCENTRATED IT IT'S NOT THAT THE HUMAN STORY IT'S ONLY TOWARDS THE END YOU START TO GET I THINK THAT WITH WITH SECTIONS THESE HUMAN STORIES BUT IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO'S MANAGED TO SURVIVE TWENTY THREE CRASHES IN ONE OF THOSE CRUSHERS WAS IN AT NIGHT IN THE ATLANTIC UPSIDE DOWN IN AN AEROPLANE THAT WAS SINKING AND THEY HAD A FEW DAYS LATER HE WAS WOUNDED BY A GERMAN BOMB STILL CARRIED THAT PIECE OF SHRAPNEL IN HIS DRAWER TO HIS DEATH
AND THEN HIT THE SHIP HE WAS ON WAS TORPEDOED AND HE WAS ONE OF TWO SURVIVORS OF HIS AIR GROUP AND YOU HAVE TO SAY
JUST HOW DO YOU GO THROUGH A LIFE OF ITS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LIFE THAT THAT'S LESS THAN ORDINARY I MEAN OR MORE THAN ORDINARY ROPE I SHOULD SAY JUST UNBELIEVABLE EMILY HORTON YOU MET HIM RELATIVELY RECENTLY HE SOUNDS LIKE A MAN WHO WOULD BE A GREAT SORT OF SWASHBUCKLER A GIANT CHARACTER WAS THAT WHAT IT WAS LIKE OH I MEAN IF IF ANYONE COULD SHE'D LINE IT WAS CAPTAIN BROWN BUT HE DIDN'T HE WAS TERRIBLY SELF FACING THERE'S NO BRAVADO THERE'S NO SWAGGER
HE WAS JUST TERRIBLY MODEST AND VERY HUMBLE AND WHEN I WENT ALONG HE HE HE WOULDN'T DROP NAMES AND I HAD TO SORT OF GO WITH A CHEQUE LISTEN TO ASK HIM AND HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED THAT I KNEW ABOUT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE AND THEN HE WOULD OFFER A LITTLE BIT BUT
THAT WAS THAT WAS ERIC IT WAS A GREAT THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE WAS TERRIBLY DOWN TO EARTH ANOTHER SURPRISE PERHAPS FOR PEOPLE LISTENING IS THAT HE WAS A GREAT LOVER OF GERMANY GERMAN SPEAKER PERSON WHO'D OBVIOUSLY SEE HIM THE HORRORS OF WHAT NAZI GERMANY HAD DONE BUT LOVE THE COUNTRY ABSOLUTELY
HE TOLD ME HE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF FRIENDS HE WAS THERE BEFORE THE WAR HE HAD STUDIED GERMAN AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY WHEN I QUESTIONED AS TO THAT IS IT STRUCK ME AS SOMETHING UNUSUAL SO I WANTED TO GO IN AND TRY MY HAND A GERMAN SO OFF HE WENT BEFORE THAT WITH THE WAR TO GERMANY
TO TEACH AND HE WAS THERE IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED AND HE WAS VERY PROMPTLY MARCHED TO THE TO THE BORDER BY A COUPLE OF S.S. GUARDS WHO WERE VERY KEEN TO BE RID OF HIM AND HIS ENERGY MIGHT I ADD IT WILL HAVE TO BE VERY VERY BRIEF IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND BUT PAUL BEAVER EVERYONE ASKED WHEN IT MAN DIES AT NINETY SEVEN WHAT'S THE SECRET WHAT DID HE GET RIGHT
I THINK WHAT HE GOT RIGHT WAS HE LIVED HIS LIFE FULLY I THINK THAT THAT'S THE KEY HE LOOKED AT EVERY RISK IN HIS LIFE AND ASSESSED AS A TEST PILOT WOULD AND THOUGHT YES I CAN DO THAT IT'S THE CONFIDENCE FACTOR OF THAT BEING A PILOT
GAVE HIM I THINK AND A WONDERFUL MAN I SHALL MISS HIM DEARLY PAUL BEAVER EMILY HORTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH REMEMBERING CAPTAIN ERIC WINKLE BROWN WHO FORGIVE ME FOR GETTING THIS WRONG WAS THE ROYAL NAVY'S MOST DECORATED
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY NINE MINUTES PAST EIGHT AND ROB'S HERE WITH THE SPORT HELLO AGAIN OR CHELSEA FIVE MANCHESTER CITY ONE STANDS OUT AS THE BIG STORY SO FAR OF THE F.A. CUP FIFTH ROUND THOSE CITY FIELD MUCH WE CAN TEAM WITH THEIR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH ON WEDNESDAY IN KIEV THE PRIORITY OTHER RESULTS AND THE SIX ROUND DRAW ON THE B.B.C. SPORT WEBSITE SHREWSBURY AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED TONIGHT COMMENTARY ON FIVE LIVE
WELL NOT ALL WEIGHTY INDEPENDENT REPORT ON GLOBAL FOOTBALL FINANCE PUBLISHED IN THE RUN UP TO THIS WEEK'S FEE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND COMMISSIONED BY THE QATAR BASED INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SPORT SECURITY ITS AUTHOR IS MAD ANDREWS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE HEART OF THE KENNEDY SCHOOL IN THE U.S.
AND ITS FINDINGS GIVE FURTHER CAUSE FOR CONCERN ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE GAMES ECONOMY HE WRITES OF HUGE DARK SPACES OF HIGH RISK TO FINANCIAL INTEGRITY AND FOOTBALL SO ARE THINGS REALLY THAT GLOOMY
I THINK THAT THE SITUATION IS BAD IF YOU LIKE LOOKING AT THE STATUS QUO THE STATUS QUO FOR US IS THAT WE JUST CAN'T SEE VERY MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON WHICH MEANS THAT MOST SUPPORTERS QUANT MOST INVESTORS CAN'T MOST SPONSORS CAN'T MANY CLUBS MANY ASSOCIATIONS LITERALLY BURNT LET YOU IN ON WHAT'S GOING ON FINANCIALLY NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE IT JUST MEANS THAT WE CAN'T SEE WHICH MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW YES IT'S GLOOMY
IF WE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SECTOR WITH SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T THERE ROBERT FORTHCOMING ON WHAT THEIR FINANCES LOOK LIKE YOU COULD FLIP THERE PRETTY QUICKLY AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET A MUCH BRIGHTER PICTURE BUT WRAP NOW YES IT'S PRETTY GLOOMY YOU MENTION SUPPORTERS TO DO FOOTBALL FANS REALLY CARE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY EVEN OF CORRUPTION IN FOOTBALL IF THEY CAN ENJOY IN THE HABIT OF PAY AS THEY DO WITH THEIR MULTI MILLIONS TO TO WATCH THE SKILLS OF THE LIKES OF A MESSY OR ANOTHER FOR EXAMPLE
I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE NOW IS THAT THE SEA HAS BECOME POTENTIALLY MORE OPAQUE THAN IT WAS BEFORE SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IT'S A BIG ISSUE I WOULD SAY THE OF THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY HAPPY WHAT'S THE WRITTEN ALL THOSE THE MINUTE THEY ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE LOCAL CLUBS AND MANY LOCAL CLUBS ARE REALLY STRUGGLING
THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT WATCHING THE SAME LEVEL THAT THEY USED TO WATCH AT THE LOCAL CLUB ON A SATURDAY THE PREMIER LEAGUE GETS QUITE A LOT OF ATTENTION IN YOUR REPORT IN YOUR SECTION ON FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY YOU DO SUGGEST THAT BROADCAST REVENUES MAY DECLINE AND THOSE OF COURSE CRUCIAL TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE I MEAN THERE'S NOT MUCH EVIDENCE OF THAT AT THE MOMENT IS THE FIVE BILLION POUNDS FOR PREMIER LEAGUE RIGHTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
THE INCREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN BROADCAST RIOTS AND THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH BROADCASTING HAS BEEN HUGE BUT IT'S BEEN A STEEP CURVE FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS RIGHT NOW THE BUBBLE WILL BURST AT SOME POINT
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE IN FIVE YEARS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO BE IN TEN YEARS BUT THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE WE'VE SEEN IT WITH EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE DOTCOM INDUSTRY WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL AND WE NEED TO BE READY WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BUBBLE BURST
WELL IF THE BUBBLES BURST YOU GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE IN A LOT OF PLACES THE NUMBER ONE PLACE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IN UEFA TEETH THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON BROADCAST REVENUES RELATED TO THEIR MAJOR TOURNAMENTS UEFA WOULD LOSE SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF ITS INCOME AT THE MOMENT THE PREMIERSHIP WOULD LOSE OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TEN YOUR INCOME SO THAT BECOMES A REALLY BIG ISSUE SIR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE SAYING IS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT DEPENDENT SIGNIFICANTLY ON JUST THAT SOURCE OF INCOME
AND A FINAL THOUGHT I MEAN IN EUROPEAN WHAT SHOULD BE THE NEXT STEP FOR FOOTBALL BEARING IN MIND THERE ARE FEET FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS LATER THIS WEEK
YOU KNOW THE FIFTH A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE TRYING TO KEEP AWAY FROM IN THE PAPER AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE ISSUES THE STRUCTURAL NOT REALLY ABOUT PERSONALITIES I THINK THAT'S ONE THING YOU SEE IN FOOTBALL A LOT EVERYTHING IT'S ABOUT PERSONALITY FOR ME IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT SOPHIE FOR IS IF THE STRUCTURES IN FEE FOR REMAIN THE SAME I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ORGANISATION THEY CAN PLAY A BIT A REGULATORY ROLE THAN THEY HAVE AND I THINK YOU NEED AN ORGANISATION WHERE YOU SEPARATE THE FUNCTIONS BETTER THAN HAS DONE BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL POLITICAL IN THE REGULATORY FUNCTIONS
THE NEXT STEP'S NEEDS TO BE ONE WHERE WE LOOK AT FOOTBALL HOLISTICALLY NOT JUST AS THE PREMIER LEAGUE NOT JUST AS THE BIG LEAGUES BUT EVEN AS EUROPE FOOTBALL IS MUCH MORE CONNECTED THAN HAD EVER HAS BEEN BEFORE AND WE NEED TO HAVE A GLOBAL VISION WHERE WE THINK GLOBALLY ABOUT THEIR FINANCES GLOBALLY ABOUT THE LABOUR MARKET AND GLOBALLY EVEN ABOVE THE COMPETITIONS THAT WE ENGAGE IN AND I THINK AT THE MOMENT ISN'T ENOUGH OF THAT IN THE SPORT PROFESSOR ABOUT ANDREW THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME THANKS A LOT

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND WITH NICK ROBINSON AT TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE SEB SOANE'S HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS DAVID CAMERON WILL GO TO PARLIAMENT THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT HIS ARGUMENT FOR REMAINING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
HE'LL OUTLINED THE DEAL HE AGREED WITH OTHER EUROPEAN LEADERS LAST WEEK WHICH HE HOPES WILL HELP PERSUADE VOTERS BACK TO BACK HIS CASE IN THE REFERENDUM IN JUNE THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON WHO FAVOURS STAYING IN THE Y. YOU TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HOLD TOGETHER AFTER THE VOTE HE SAID THERE WAS A GREATER RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY IF BRITAIN LEAVES THE E.U.
A REPORT SAYS A NEW COMMISSIONER IS NEEDED TO END WHAT IT CALLS THE ROUGH DEAL EXPERIENCE BY PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES AND ENGLAND SO STEPHEN BOB PROPOSED REFORMS A YEAR AGO IN HIS INQUIRY INTO THE SCANDAL OF POOR TREATMENT AT WINTERBOURNE VIEW HOME NEAR BRISTOL HE SAYS THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO TO REBUILD TRUST IN

THE CHANCELLOR'S PROMISED TO SPEND BILLIONS ON GRAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INCLUDING HIGH SPEED ROAD AND RAIL LINKS IN WHAT HE CALLS THE NORTHERN POWER HOUSE ONE OF THE SCHEME'S BEING CONSIDERED IS A ROAD TUNNEL MORE THAN THIRTY MONEY EELS' LONG TO BUBBLING FOR THE CHANNEL TUNNEL BETWEEN SHEFFIELD AND MANCHESTER
THE END OF OCTOBER GEORGE OSBORNE COMMISSIONED FORMER LABOUR MINISTER LORD ADONIS AS AN ADVISOR HE'S TEAM REPORTS NEXT WEEK BUT CRITICS COMPLAINED THAT THE TIME ALLOWED FOR DELIBERATIONS IS LUDICROUSLY SHORT GIVEN THE VAST SUMS OF MONEY AT STAKE AND THE FEROCITY OF THE DEBATE OVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD FAVOUR ROAD
OR RAIL INTERCITY ALL WITHIN CITY OR INDEED WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SPEND THE MONEY ON EDUCATION AND SKILLS ROGER RIBBON NOW REPORTS
ON A CHILLY MORNING IN HUDDERSFIELD TAXI DRIVERS LISTENED TO SEE PRAYERS AS THEY
THIS TOWN LIES AT THE HEART OF WHAT THE CHANCELLOR CALLS THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE LOCALS WELCOME HIS PROMISE THAT IN
SIXTY TWO IS A LAKE A GRAPHICS
I DON'T KNOW SHE WAS A BLOCKED
TRAFFIC DELAYS IN THE LONDON AREA FOR MORE THAN THREE TIMES WORSE THAN THEY ARE HERE IN YORKSHIRE BUT THE CHANCELLOR THINKS THAT IMPROVING TRANSPORT ACROSS THE PENNINES CAN WALES CITIES INTO A SINGLE VIBRANT ECONOMY TO COUNTERBALANCE THE ECONOMIC MIGHT OF THE CAPITAL
RICHARD THRELFALL HEAD OF INFRASTRUCTURE AT CONSULTANTS K.P.M.G. HAS BEEN LOBBYING GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS TO THINK BIG
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ENOUGH JUST TO CHANGE A FEW TRAIN CARRIAGES OR STRAIGHT OUT A FEW BITS OF TRACK OR ADD ANOTHER LINE AND ON THE SIDE OF A MOTORWAY IF WE ARE GOING TO REALLY MAKE A RADICAL DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE ECONOMY OF THE NORTH OPERATES
THEN WE CAN ONLY DO THAT IN MY VIEW BY A REALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMME
WE'VE BEEN BLASTING A WAY THROUGH THE PENNINES FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS I'M AT THIS BANDAGE TUNNEL VISITOR CENTRE NEAR HUDDERSFIELD AND IN FRONT OF ME IS THE HOLE IN THE ROCK WHERE ENGINEERS IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DECIDED THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE HILL INSTEAD OF ROUNDED
ELIN RICHARDS FROM THE CANAL AND RIVER TRUST EXPLAINS IT'S HUGE FOR SEE EVENT AND AARON
IT'S DONE THROUGH BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS REALLY ALIVE NOW
THE RAILWAY ENGINEERS FOLLOWED WITH A DOUBLE TUNNEL AND NOW THERE ARE TWO REDUNDANT TUNNELS WHICH MIGHT PROVIDE THE ROUTE FOR A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TRANS PENNINE RAILWAY
AND EVEN MORE HEROIC PLAN ENVISAGES ONE OF THE LONGEST ROADS TUNNELS IN THE WORLD STRETCHING UNDER THE HILLS FROM SHEFFIELD TO MANCHESTER IT'S CAUSED SOME EXCITEMENT BUT ANNE ROBINSON FROM THE PRESSURE GROUP FRIENDS OF THE PEAK DISTRICT HE'S UNIMPRESSED
WE'VE NOT BEEN SEWN A SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE TUNNEL AND THE ROAD IS NEEDED BUT AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE ALL THIS NEW ROLE IN ITS TUNNEL WILL DO WILL MOVE TRAFFIC SWIFTLY ACROSS THE PENNINES AND THEN DUMP DRIVERS INTO CONGESTED CITY STREETS TO SITTIN POLLUTING TRAFFIC JAMS AND THEN LOSE ALL THE TIME THEY SAY
EVEN SOME REGULAR COMMUTERS QUESTION WHETHER HEROIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED IN LEEDS PEOPLE TELL ME THE TRANS PENNINE RAIL ROUTE IS A PROBLEM BUT ONLY AT RUSSIA
AT TIMES BUT IT'S
THE TIME WE HAVE BEANS HAD STAND UP FOR AN HOUR AND HALF IT COULD BE A LOT LESS THAN
PROFESSOR PETER IMMACULATE THE LEEDS INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORT STUDIES THINKS SERVICE CAN BE IMPROVED SIMPLY WITH ELECTRIFICATION AND EXTRA CARRIAGES
WHAT COMMUTERS IMPROVEMENT FAST TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT IN OTHER WORDS NO NEW HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE IS NEEDED YET
ACROSS THE HILLS IN MANCHESTER'S SOME PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING ANOTHER TENET OF THE NORTHERN POWERHOUSE THAT SPENDING SHOULD FOCUS ON TRAVEL BETWEEN THE NORTHERN CITIES RATHER THAN TRAVEL WITHIN THOSE CITIES
GETTING ON THIS NO THAT'S NOT DROWSY PRETTY GOOD ARE THEY YEAH VERY GOOD IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE TRAM
TERRIBLE ON THE BUS NOW
MANCHESTER'S THE WORST PLACES FOR CONGESTION IT WOULD BE BETTER SO SORT THOSE PROBLEMS OUT BEFORE WE START EXPANDING SERVICES TO HAVE THE PLACE
PROFESSOR MACKIE TENDS TO AGREE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT ACCESSIBILITY
ESPECIALLY THOUGHT URBAN TRIPS DOES IMPROVE SPEED WORKING AT CITIES THINK WHAT'S MORE DOWN
HOW BETTER INTO URBAN CONICS
WILL IMPROVE THE JOINT FUNCTION
OF LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER LEEDS YORK AND
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHERE THE MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE BRINGS THE BENEFITS THAT ARE CLAIMED A B. B. C. ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN ROAD SPENDING FOR INSTANCE COULDN'T FIND ANY CONVINCING CORRELATION BETWEEN MONEY SPENT AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION EASED
EVEN JOHN CRADLE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BODY TRANSPORT FOR THE NORTH ADMITS THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT BILLIONS OF POUNDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT THE ECONOMY
I'M NOT CLAIMING THAT THERE IS A PERFECT SCIENCE HERE BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT AFTER DECADES OF UNDER INVESTMENT IT'S NOW TIME TO MAKE UP THAT INVESTMENT GAP AND IT WILL LEAD TO
BETTER TRAVELLING EXPERIENCES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
TRANSPORT ECONOMICS CAN'T ALWAYS PROVE THIS SOMETIMES LIKE THE VICTORIAN ENGINEERS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LEAP OF FAITH MANY IN THE NORTH HAVE A LITTLE FAITH THAT THINGS WILL IMPROVE MUCH
SOME THINK INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING WILL HELP PRODUCTIVITY IN THE REGION MORE THAN ROADS OR RAILWAYS THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION WILL OFFER HIS THOUGHTS VERY SOON ON HOW THE CHANCELLOR'S BILLIONS SHOULD BE SPENT
ROGER HOWARD BEEN REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE TEN DAYS AGO WE LEARNED WE WERE LOSING A NEWSPAPER THE INDEPENDENT TODAY WE LEARN WE'RE GETTING A NEW ONE IT'S CALLED THE NEW DAY AND IT'S BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE TRINITY MIRROR GROUP AND ITS EDITOR IS ALISON PHILIPS AND SHE IS WITH ME GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND I HAVE IN MY HAND A COPY OF IT WELL NOT THE COPY BUT
WHAT IT IS GO RECENTLY DESCRIBE IT IT'S A TABLOID IT IS IT'S VERY BRIGHT LOOKING IT'S VERY MODERN IT'S LOVELY BEAUTIFUL WHITE PAPER STAPLES AND WE BELIEVE IT'S FORTY PAGES OF EVERYTHING PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ON ANY GIVEN DAY WHERE YOU PITCHING IT BECAUSE THIS IS IT'S A TABLOID BUT IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANTLY A RED TOP TABLOID IT'S BLUE NO IT MOST CERTAINLY ISN'T A RED TOP WE'RE PITCHING IT EVERYONE BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE INFORMED BY ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN ANY GIVEN DAY CAN'T BE SEEN TO BE BUYING A RED TOP IS THAT IT YEAH IT'S BUT IT'S PEOPLE WHO WHO WANTS A SORT OF A MORE MODERN APPROACH TO USE AND HE DON'T WANT ME BUT I THOUGHT HE'D WITH US I'VE BEEN A MODERN PRINT IT MEANS BECAUSE WHILST WE'VE CONTINUE TO PUT NEWSPAPERS OUT IN A FAIRLY SIMILAR WAY FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS THERE'S BEEN A SORT OF MASSIVE NUCLEAR BOMB GOING OFF IN THE IN THE MEDIA WORLD WITH THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET
AND WE'VE CREATED A NEWSPAPER THAT REFLECTS THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT SO NOW THERE'S A BREAKING STORY PEOPLE HAVE GOT NEWS ALERTS ON THEIR PHONES ALL THE TIME BUT WHAT THEY QUITE OFTEN WANT IS A RUTHLESS EDIT OF THE DAY SO THIS IS WHAT THEY NEED TO HER RUTH YOU SAID IT WAS THIS IS WHAT THEY NEED AND THEY'RE ALSO THIS IS SOMETHING WITH WHICH THEY CAN
SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE DAISIES IT'S NOT A BIG READ NO FORTY PAGES WHERE IS MOST MOST PEOPLE WE HAVE SPOKEN TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO THEY ONLY WHAT THIRTY MINUTES THEY ONLY HAVE THIRTY MINUTES EVERYONE'S TIME POOR NOWADAYS SO I COULD READ THIS WHOLE THING IN THIRTY MINUTE ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES YES OR EVEN LESS MAYBE MY PICTURES
ALL RIGHT TIMED IT IT'S ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AND WITHIN THAT THERE ARE SMALLER PIECES TO KEEP PEOPLE UP TO DATE WITH WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN A LOT MORE DEPTH AND THERE'S ANALYSES AND THERE'S OPINION AND THERE'S COMMENT BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS
GIVING A BALANCED OPINION ON I THINK THAT WE DO THAT I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU'RE NOT DAILY MIRROR LIGHT ABSOLUTELY NOT NO WE ARE ENTIRELY STANDALONE PRODUCT AND WE ARE WE ARE NOT HAVING A
THE POLITICAL LINE OF OUR OWN WE WILL JUST TELL THEIR STORY STRAIGHT WE WILL PROVIDE THE FACTS AND WILL PROVIDE OPINION FROM ACROSS THE ARGUMENT AND THEN TREAT ARIES AT GROWN UPS WHO ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING UP THEIR OWN MIKE TO BE TALKING TO THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT TWENTY YEARS THIRTY YEARS AGO WELL PUT IN BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TAKE THOSE PRINCIPLES INTO THE TO THE MASS MARKET AS WELL THE IDEA THAT
YES BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO TO TO THE MASS WEARERS INTO POPULAR NEWSPAPERS WITH PAVA AT THE MOMENT GOT A PAPER WHICH SPEAKS TO PEOPLE AND ALLOWS THEM TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN AND WHEN YOU GET TO SORT OF SITUATION WHERE A MOMENT WITH YOU IT'S SO IMPORTANT IT IS AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
DIFFICULT SUBJECT AND PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE LOOK SORT OF QUITE BEWILDERED ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE HE'S EIGHTEEN OR IS IT OUT AND THEY WANT SOMEONE WHO CAN GIVE THEM ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEY CAN MAKE THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS OBVIOUSLY THE DANGER OF FALLEN BETWEEN TWO STOOLS YOU WON'T SATISFY THE GUARDIAN REALLY WITH THE HANG ON AIMING AT THE GUARDIAN READING YOU WEREN'T SATISFIED WITH THIS BLUE REASONS YOU JUST SO YOU FALL BETWEEN TWO STOOLS IS NOT A RISK
NO I DON'T THINK IT IS IT'S A HUGE AREA IN THE MIDDLE AND WE'VE SPOKEN TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND I CANNOT OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH PEOPLE HAVE LIKED THE IDEA ABOUT NOT BEING TOLD WHAT TO THINK ANY MORE THAT'S A MASSIVE DRIVER AND THE OTHER THING THEY DON'T WANT ANY
THEY WANT TO PIN IT'LL BE MASSES OF OPINION IN THIS BUT IT'S NOT THE NEWSPAPERS OPINION WE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE LEADERS SURELY I HAVE MADE NO LEADER COLUMN WOW IT'S DIFFERENT WE'VE GOT WHY SHOULD I HE'S THE EDITOR OF A NEWSPAPER ENFORCE MY OPINION ON MY READ IT COS I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD TURN TO HER DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE A BIT BONY FAR FAR MORE BENEFICIAL TO EVERYBODY INVOLVED IF YOU HAD
PEEP FROM DIFFERENT SIZED AN ARGUMENT GIVING THEIR INFORMED OPINION FROM WHICH YOU HAVE THERE MAKE YOUR DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS DON'T YOU THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT DOES IT I MEAN NOT BECAUSE THEN THEY DO IT DON'T YOU I THINK THE WHOLE SORT OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE SHARING OF NEWS HAS CHANGED THE WAY THAT PEOPLE OPERATE AND WE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN THAT PEOPLE DON'T IN THIS DAY AND AGE I BELIEVE WANT SOME SORT OF GREAT
NEWSPAPER ON HIGH TELLING THEM WHAT THEY SHOULD THINK THE OTHER THREE THAT WE'RE DOING IT TO MAKE IT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF CREATE A MOOD OF OPTIMISM AND POSITIVITY WHICH IS LACKING I THINK ELSEWHERE AND SHEAR US UP AS WE MESSY WELL IN YOURSELF ALL RIGHT AT THE END OF IT THERE YOU GO WELL GOOD LUCK WITH IT IT'S COLD IT'S GOING TO COST IN THE END FIFTY PENCE YES FIRST AID WILL BE FREE AND ALL THAT AND IT DOES LOOK VERY BRIGHT AND BREEZY I SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS
THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW THE INDIAN CAPITAL OF DELHI WRIST RUNNING OUT OF WATER THIS MORNING BECAUSE SOME OF ITS POOREST CITIZENS TOOK CONTROL OF HER CAN NOW SUPPLYING WATER TO THE CITY THE ARMY INVOLVED THERE ARE PEOPLE DYING AS PART OF THESE PROTEST LET'S JOIN OUR CORRESPONDENT JUSTIN RED THAT WHO'S OUTSIDE THE DELI WATER BOARD MORNING JUST IS VERY SORT OF IT'S BEEN RESOLVED YET
YEAH THERE'S RUMOURS THAT THE DEAL HAS BEEN DONE BUT THE BLOCKADE OF THE ROAD THEY'VE BLOCKADED ROADS RAILWAYS AND BLOCKED AND DISRUPTED WATER IN A CANAL THAT SUPPLIES
BUT NO SIGN OF THE BLOCKADE BEING LIFTED A TEN MILLION PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE THE HEAD OF THE WATER BOARD NOW HAVE NO WATER AT ALL IN DELHI SO THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR WHAT IS THE FOURTH
BIGGEST CITY IN THE WORLD AT THE MOMENT I'VE SPENT THE DAY OUT WITH TANKER DRIVERS DELIVERING WATER TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN CUT OFF BUT THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR THE CITY AND WHAT WITH THE PROTESTS SPARKED BY
THAT ACTUALLY IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED THING THAT I'M NOT ACTUALLY A LOW CASTE GROUP THAT ACTUALLY CLASSIFIED THE CHAT COMMUNITY WHICH ARE THE GUYS THAT ARE PROTESTING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PROTESTING ARE ACTUALLY CLASSIFIED AS AN UPPER CLASS GROUP OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS LISTEN WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS WITHIN A CASTE GROUP ORIGINS ARE AS RURAL FARMERS AND WE DESERVE TO GET THE BENEFITS THAT LOWER CASTE GROUPS GET IT HAS A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM OF RESERVATIONS IT'S KIND OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
FOR CAST GROUPS THAT ARE CONSIDERED DEPRIVED OR THEY GET GOVERNMENT JOBS THEY GET ACCESS TO EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT KIND OF THING IS WHAT THE CHAPS ARE SAYING IS WE WANT A BIT OF THAT ACTION THAT'S WHAT THESE PROTESTS HAVE BEEN ABOUT IT'S BIGGER GOING ON YOU
THE THIS SIMMERING AGITATION FOR THIS CHANGE IN THE IN THE RESERVATION PROTEST BUT THIS IS THE BIGGEST DEMONSTRATION BY CHAT SO FAR AND THE DANGER LOTS OF PEOPLE SAYING THE DANGER OF THE GOVERNMENT GIVING INTO THIS IT'S NOT HER ALL SORTS OF OTHER
CAST GROUPS IN INDIA WHOLESALER SOON HOLD ON WHERE ARE WE HAVE GOT PROBLEMS AS WELL WE WANT SOME OF THOSE THOSE GOVERNMENT JOBS THOSE FREE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AS WELL THERE'S ALREADY AN ISSUE WITH PATEL'S WHICH IS A HUGE CAST GROUP IN INDIA IN GUJARAT WHO PROTESTING BEEN PROTESTING FOR VERY SIMILAR
KIND OF RIGHT SO IT'S A REALLY BIG ISSUE IN INDIA BUT EFFECTIVELY THE TRAPS HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE CAPITAL CITY DELHI HOSTAGE BY CUTTING OFF THEIR WATER SUPPLIES JUSTIN ROLLER IN DELHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TEN TO NINE AND BY THE TIME THE REFERENDUM ROLLS AROUND YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS FOR STAYING IN OR LEAVING THE E.U. BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO USE THOSE FOUR MONTHS SWOTTING UP ON EUROPE WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO WITH THAT TIME AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS CALCULATED VERY LOOSE CALCULATION THIS OBVIOUSLY
BUT YOU COULD PROBABLY SAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HOURS BETWEEN AND JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD IF YOU AVOID ALL THAT THREATENED TO COVERAGE WHICH IT'S DIFFICULT IN ITSELF ANYWAY HERE ARE A FEW THOUGHTS FROM OLIVIA GUESS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
SO FOUR MONTHS YOU COULD LEARN A SKILL SUCH AS SOME VERY BASIC PROGRAMMING
YOU COULD YOU COULD PROBABLY START LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE A COOKING
PROBABLY A FOLLOW IMPERFECT SOME RECIPES YOU PROBABLY LANTERN NEXT YOU COULD PROBABLY LEARN TO RIDE A BIKE IN FOUR MONTHS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW HOW TO SWIM IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW HOW TO SWIM IT'S A TOUGH ONE FOR MONTHS IS NOT THAT LONG ACTUALLY
RIGHT WELL THERE YOU ARE THERE ARE A FEW THOUGHTS LISA IS THE TRAVEL EDITOR OF THE SUN GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING RIGHT TWO HUNDRED HOURS WE'VE AVOIDED ALL THE OTHER STUFF SO WE'VE GOT THESE TWO OUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM
I THINK WE SHOULD GO ON HOLIDAY I THINK THAT'S THE BEST IDEA AS GO ON AWARE WHAT THERE'S SOME GREAT PLACES THAT ARE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK IN EUROPE ITSELF OBVIOUSLY THE CANARY ISLANDS IS EXPERIENCING A QUITE A BIG BOOM AT THE MOMENT IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT IS CONSIDERED SAFE EVERYONE WANTS TO GO TO
THAT MEANS THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT I SHOULD HAVE SOME FANTASTIC LITTLE HIDDEN GEMS IN THE CANARY ISLANDS OUR HERO IS THE SMALLEST MOST SOUTHERN OF THE CANARY ISLANDS AND IT'S FANTASTIC RICH FOREST SEA CLIFFS IT'S A FANTASTIC DIVE RESERVE THERE'S LOADS OF PLACES TO DIVE THERE
ONE THING THAT YOU MAYBE WON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ISLAND IS THIS ACTUALLY FREE WIFE I EVERYWHERE SO THAT YOU'LL BEAT TO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE THE GRAND TOUR YOU KNOW LET'S GO BACK A CENTURY AND WE DON'T NEED ELEPHANTS ACROSS THE ALPS OR SOMETHING ON THAT'S A FEW CENTURIES AGO WASN'T IT BUT BUT MAYBE SOME SORT OF GRAND TOUR
WELL OF COURSE YES I THINK YOU PROBABLY COULD DO A GRAND TOUR AND TWO HUNDRED HOURS DOESN'T GIVE YOU A LOT OF TIME TO DO A GRAND TOUR BUT MAYBE YOU COULD DO THE MODERN EQUIVALENT OF THAT AND HOP ON A CRUISE SHIP THAT COULD TAKE YOU TO SOME OF THOSE FANTASTIC PLACES ROME NAPLES CASH ALL OUR TIME ON THE SHIP DON'T YOU MIGHT DO THAT AND THAT'S IT AND THAT'S A GREAT WAY OF ACTUALLY AVOIDING ANY KIND OF NEWS AT ALL BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE ON THE SHIP YOU'VE GOT NO WIFE I AM AND YOU WON'T REALLY BE LEFT THERE TO JUST ADMIRE THE VIEW
AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT ABOUT THE TASMANIAN WILDERNESS TASMANIAN WILDERNESS COULD BE FANTASTIC MIGHT TAKE YOU SLIGHTLY LONGER TO GET THERE THEY MIGHT HAVE A FEW PRECIOUS HOURS YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FLYING IN THAT RIGHT SO IT'S GOT TO THAT'S A GOOD POINT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE FAIRLY CLOSE HASN'T IT
THAT'S RIGHT AND ANOTHER ONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE THE ISLAND OF PORK AT ALL WHICH IS JUST OFF THE COAST THE ISLAND OF PORKERS ON O. WHICH IS JUST OFF THE COAST OF FRANCE IT'S ON THE COAST THE FANTASTIC FRENCH RIVIERA BUT THE ISLAND'S ABOUT TEN MINUTES AWAY BY FERRY AND ACTUALLY NATIONAL PARKS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE'S NO CARS ON THE ISLAND IT'S ONLY BIKES
BEAUTIFUL BEACHES AND IT REALLY IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY GET AWAY BUT IT'S A MERE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF THE COAT DOES YEAR AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE YES I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISLANDS WHAT IS IT CORPORAL CHEETAH JUST OFF THE COAST OF CAPRI VERY VERY REMOTE THAT ONE THAT'S RIGHT EXACTLY THE SAME THING I MEAN IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE PORTOFINO TINY LITTLE BEAUTIFUL HOUSES OR DIFFERENT WHITE WASHED COLOUR AND DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL COLOURS AGAIN
ONCE YOU TAKE ON TO AN IRELAND YOU'RE UP YOU REALLY ARE REMOVING YOURSELF FROM THE GENERAL IDEA OF BEING IN IN A SORT OF BIG CITY SITUATION AND BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO US YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST OFF THE ISLAND
OF CAPRI YOU'VE GOT PURSUED ITS BEAUTIFUL ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ON US IT'S GREAT TO EXPLORE BY FOOT LOTS OF HIKING BUT THERE'S PLENTY TO DO THERE AS WELL IN TERMS OF MAYBE JUST GETTING INTO A CAFE SITTING DOWN AND HAVING A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PETE'S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SAME TIME I'M BEGINNING TO HATE YOU AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE CLOSE AT THAT'S WHO COULDN'T ESCAPE EVEN IF WE WALKED IT
YES UNFORTUNATELY KNOWING THAT BET LISA THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED LISA MINNOW ONLY ON THERE TODAY WE TELL YOU HOW TO AVOID THE ISLANDS IN THE RIVER KNOW THAT AND THEN DO A DISCUSSION OF THE REFERENDUM HERE IT CARVES SORRY FOR THERE YOU MAY KNOW HOW YOU CAN VOTE ALREADY HE MAY NOT BE SURE YOU MADE NOT MUCH CARE
WHATEVER YOUR VIEW ABOUT WHETHER THE U.K. SHOULD REMAIN IN OR LEAVE THE E.U. MILLIONS WILL NOW BE SPENT TRYING TO PERSUADE YOU TO BUY ONE OR OTHER SIDE ON THURSDAY JUNE THE TWENTY FOURTH SO WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE OTHER REFERENDUMS THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH RECENTLY
ONE IN SCOTLAND OF COURSE WELL PROFESSOR JOHN CURTIS IS PROFESSOR OF POLITICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STRATHCLYDE AND THERE WAS ANOTHER REFERENDUM THEY FORGOT THIS WHAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ON A VOTING SYSTEM THE ALTERNATIVE VOTE WHICH WAS REJECTED KATIE GOES JOINS US SHE WAS THE FORMER IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF YES TO FAIRER VOTES AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ELECTORAL REFORM SOCIETY MORNING TO YOU BOTH
JOHN FIRST OF ALL PERSONALITIES DO THEY MATTER GIVEN WE'VE SEEN THE BIG TO AS IT WERE UNVEILED THIS WEEKEND THE PRIME MINISTER ON THE ONE HAND AND OF COURSE BORIS JOHNSON ON THE UP
THAT'S ALWAYS IN POLITICS NICK PERSONALITIES MATTERED BECAUSE THEY ARE THE VEHICLES FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF MESSAGES I'M NOT SURE AT THE END OF THEIR MANY PEOPLE IN THE REFERENDUM ARE GOING TO VOTE ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER THEY LIKE DAVID CAMERON OR BORIS JOHNSON OR NIGEL FERRAR'S YOUR PHILIP HAMMOND AS INDIVIDUALS BUT THE POINT IS THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ABOVE ALL WILL BE TRYING TO PERSUADE US IN THOSE TWO HUNDRED HOURS WHICH WAY TO VOTE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH THEY DO SO WILL MATTER AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES
THAT THE YES CAMPAIGN HIRED IN SCOTLAND PRINCE REFERENDUM IT WAS LED BY ALEX SALMOND AGAIN A VERY CHARISMATIC FIGURE SUPPORTED BY NICOLA STURGEON ANOTHER CHARISMATIC FIGURE RISE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE I'M ALISTAIR DARLING SHALL WE SAY DID HIS LEVEL BEST AND INDEED IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE TWO DEBATES ARE BUT ODDLY GOT THE BETTER OF MY SALON BUT EVEN SO THERE WAS A CLEAR DISADVANTAGE TO HIDE THE TRUTH IS THAT ALTHOUGH IN THE END SCOTLAND STILL VOTED TO REMAIN INSIDE THE UNION IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE YES SIDE WON THE CAMPAIGN
IN THE SENSE THAT WE STARTED OFF WITH ONLY AROUND THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND WE ENDED UP TO FORTY FIVE AND AT LEAST IN PART THAT PROBABLY IS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THE S.N.P. HAD EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATORS NOW KATIE HE WHEN YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THAT A.V. REFERENDUM PART OF THE PROBLEM I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU IT WAS NO BIG POWERFUL PERSONALITY WAS OUT THERE SAYING LOOK CHANGE THE VOTING SYSTEM REALLY WILL MATTER
THAT'S RIGHT BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT THE POLITICS OF THE DAY A CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT IN ANY REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN WHAT CAN END UP HAPPENING I THINK WE SAW THAT WITH A.D. WHICH IT WAS THEIR POPULARITY OR LACK OF POPULARITY OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS THAT WAS REALLY BECAME THE ISSUE ON THE BALLOT PAPER IF YOU LIKE RATHER THAN THE ISSUE AT STAKE ITSELF AND I'D AGREE WITH JOHN I THINK THE STANCE THAT PARTY LEADERS TAKE THAT GIVES A KIND OF A CUE OR A SIGNAL AND MANY VOTERS WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THAT AND IN THE CURRENT REFERENDUM CABINETS ARE PRETTY SHORT REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN AND A LOT OF VOTERS WILL BE LOOKING
AT THE PARTY LEADER THEY TRUST OR TEND TO SUPPORT IN AND IN AN ELECTION AND BE A BIT INFLUENCED BY THAT THAT RAISES FASCINATING CHOICE DOESN'T IT JOHN CURTIS ON THE ONE HAND PEOPLE TEND TO LIKE TO USE ANY VOTE IN MID TERM TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY A BLOODY NOSE ON THE OTHER HAND DAVID CAMERON HE'S ONLY JUST BEEN ELECTED AS A PRIME MINISTER AGAIN AND JEREMY COLEMAN'S GOT ONE OR TWO POLITICAL PROBLEMS AT THE MOMENT SO WHICH WAY ON BALANCE DO YOU THINK THAT CONTEXT AFFECTS THIS VOTE
WELL IT'S CERTAINLY FASCINATING BUT WE HAVE A LABOUR PARTY WHICH IS SERIOUSLY DIVIDED A LOOTER WHO IS CLEARLY STRUGGLING OPINION POLLS NOW FACING OFF AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS FRANKLY NOW DEEPLY DIVIDE OR CERTAINLY A CONSERVATIVE PARTY THAT IS DEEPLY DIVIDED AND THEREFORE IT IS COMING BACK TO KATIE'S POINT UP THE CUES THAT COME FROM A CONVENTIONAL PARTIES MAY NOT BE THAT STRONG IN PARTICULAR BUT MAY NOT BE HER STRONGEST MY CAMERA WAS HOPING FOR PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS RENEGOTIATION WAS TO PERSUADE HIS PARTY
THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO STAY IN UP AND THEREBY HELPS US FRESH CONSERVATIVE VOTERS IN THE REMAIN DIRECTION IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT STRATEGY HAS FAILED GIVEN BORIS JOHNSON'S DECISION KATIE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN AGAIN WAS TRICKY FOR YOU IN THE A.V. CAMPAIGN AND DEFINITELY DID DAMAGE TO THOSE WHO WANTED SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE YES COST COMPLEXITY AND FEAR A TRIED AND TESTED KIND OF TOOLS OF ANY REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IT'S BEEN VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN IS NOW BEING PUSHED OUT THERE BY BOTH THE LEAVES AND THERE REMAIN CAMPS
BECAUSE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE COMPLAIN CASE GOES ABOUT NEGATIVE POLITICS OR WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED PROJECT FEAR ALL THE EVIDENCE ISN'T IT THAT IT DRIVES EFFECTS THAT'S RIGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE FROM REFERENDUM CAMPAIGNS AROUND THE WORLD THAT'S WHY QUITE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE STATUS QUO WITHOUT THAT EVERY SINGLE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN IS UNIQUE UNCONTROVERSIAL QUESTION DO YOU JOHN WHO'S GOING TO WIN
THE ANSWER TO THAT NICK IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE OPINION POLLS ARE GIVING US TWO DIFFERENT MESSAGES ONE SET ARE SAYING IT'S EVEN STEVENS THE OTHER SAYING TO REMAIN A WELL AHEAD BUT IN ANY EVENT EUROPE IS AN ISSUE ON WHICH WE CHANGED OUR MINDS QUITE RADICALLY DURING THE COURSE OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND MAYBE WILL STILL DO SO WE'RE GOING TO IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS
BUT ON BALANCE IN TEN SECONDS I'LL BE BALANCE REMAINED TO START HIS CAMPAIGN AS FAVOURITES BUT I WOULD NOT YET WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH MONEY ON PRESUMING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WIN KATIE GAUGE WHAT MASSES IS THE BEST QUALITY INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET REALLY INVOLVED IN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND SO OVERALL WINNER
OR WE HEAD OFF TO ONE OF THOSE ISLANDS JOHN'S ALREADY YOU COULD HEAR TAPPING IN THE BACKGROUND ALREADY CHECKING OUR EDITORS WERE LAURA COOPER AND I'M GOING TO SKI GOOD MORNING
