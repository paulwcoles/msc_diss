INDEPENDENT SAYS THAT THE LATEST ANNOUNCEMENT IT WILL BE MET WITH CYNICISM IN WESTERN CAPITALS WERE DIPLOMATS SAY THAT MY PUTIN HAS PROVED TO BE IN THE CURE REAL AN UNTRUSTWORTHY PARTNER NOT JUST IN THE SIERRA CONFLICT BUT ALSO IN THE WAR
IN UKRAINE AND THE TIMES SAYS THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT CARSON OUT MOSCOW SUPPORT FOR THE REGIME OF PRESIDENT ASAD IT SAYS THAT HE'S DOING IT TO AVOID BEING DRAGGED INTO AN OPEN ENDED WAR IN THE SHORT TERM IT COULD BOOST HOPES FOR PEACE TALKS WHICH STARTED YESTERDAY AND EVA BUDGET STORY MAKES HIS WAY ONTO A COUPLE OF FROM PAGES THE TIMES HEADLINE OSBORNE AIMS TO BUILD HIS WAY OUT OF TROUBLE PICK UP THE STORY WE WERE REPORTING THE NEWS THERE THAT HE SAYS THAT HE WILL SPEND
ON TWO NEW RAIL LINES THE F. TEAS VERSION OF THAT STORY OSBORNE GIVES GREEN LIGHT FOR FAST RAIL LINKS ACROSS LONDON AND THE PENNINES NOW JUST IN CASE YOU THINK A GREEN LIGHT MEANS THAT VERY SOON YOU'LL BE MOVING FASTER THAN YOU ARE NOW THE CROSSRAIL PROJECT IN LONDON THAT WOULD COME ONLINE IN THE TWENTIES THIRTIES AND THAT MUCH MUCH MUCH TALKED ABOUT MANCHESTER TO LEEDS IMPROVEMENT IMPROVING THEIR LINE THEIR SO CALLED H. S. THREE THAT AT THE EARLIEST IS EXPECTED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO
THE DAILY MAIL'S LEAD STORY IS WHAT IT CALLS THE CRIPPLING COST OF THE LIVING WAGE IT SAYS BIG FIRMS INCLUDING TESCO BEING Q. AND WHITBREAD ARE AMONG THOSE TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS AHEAD OF THE FIFTY P. AN HOUR PAY RISE COMING INTO EFFECT NEXT MONTH IT SAYS THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT INCLUDES SLASHING OVERTIME CUTTING RECRUITMENT AND AXING STAFF PERKS TO HELP PAY FOR THE NEW NATIONAL LIVING WAGE

HE CONFESSED WITH PUTTING PHOTOGRAPH ON ON TWITTER I WASN'T TELLING TALES IT'S TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN ANNOUNCEMENT TO PULL MOST OF ITS TROOPS OUT OF ASSYRIA BETHANY BELL OUR CORRESPONDENT JOINS US FROM GENEVA WHERE THE PEACE TALKS ON SYRIA RESUMED YESTERDAY BETHANY WHAT DOES THE REACTION TO PRESIDENT PUTIN'S ANNOUNCEMENT BEEN LIKE
WE HEARD LAST NIGHT FROM THE MAIN OPPOSITION ALLIANCE AND A SPOKESMAN THERE SAID THAT IF THIS IS SERIOUS IT COULD GIVE
THE TALKS ARE POSITIVE PUSH BECAUSE HE SAID IF IT WAS A SERIOUS STEP IT COULD FORM WHAT HE CALLED A MAJOR ELEMENT OF PRESSURE ON THE REGIME BECAUSE OF THE RUSSIAN SUPPORT PROLONGING THE REGIME AND HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT MATTERS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF THIS
THERE WILL BE OTHER PEOPLE HERE WHO WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TENTATIVE SUGGESTING THAT YES THIS COULD BE AN ATTEMPT BY RUSSIA TO PRESSURISE MY ASS HAD TO NEGOTIATE
OR IT COULD REFLECT A NEW CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSITION BOLSTERED UP BY THE RUSSIAN ESPERANTO COULD GO EITHER WAY THEN WHAT OF THE SYRIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS HAD TO SAY WHO YOU KNOW HAVE LONG EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE PROMINENCE OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IN THESE TALKS
WELL WHAT I THINK THERE'S A FEELING HERE AT THE MOMENT IS THAT AT THE WEEKEND BOTH SIDES THERE WERE SOME VERY VERY HARDLINE STATEMENTS COMING OUT OF DAMASCUS WE HAD THE SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER RULING OUT ANY DISCUSSION OF THE FUTURE OF PRESIDENT ASAD SAYING THAT THAT WAS A RED LINE
FOUR FOR THE GOVERNMENT WHAT THE POSITION IS HOPING NOW IS THAT WITH THIS MOVED BY RUSSIA
THAT COULD PERHAPS CHANGE THAT PERHAPS THIS MOVE WILL FORCE THE GOVERNMENT INTO BEING MORE CO OPERATIVE THESE TALKS THOUGH EXTREMELY TOUGH AND I THINK NOBODY IS EXPECTING THIS TO BE THE SORT OF GREAT
GAME CHANGER IF YOU LIKE NECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EVEN SITTING IN THE SAME ROOMS AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE INDIRECT TALKS IT IS RECOGNISED THAT RUSSIA IS A VERY VERY CENTRAL PLAYER AND WE HEARD FROM THE UN
SPECIAL ENVOY YESTERDAY SAYING THAT IF HE SAW NO WILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE HE WOULDN'T HESITATE TO PULL IN WHAT HE CALLED THE BIG INFLUENCES THE BIG POWERS RUSSIA
NINETEEN STATES AND THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL BETHANY BELL IN GENEVA THANK YOU IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX MORE NOW ON THAT NEWS THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS PLANNING AND PROMISING TO SPEND OR BILLIONS MORE AT LEAST IN THE LONG TERM RATHER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN THE SHORT TERM ON IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY THE NORTH OF ENGLAND MATHEW PRICES HERE WITHOUT THE REST THE BUSINESS WHICH MORNING THANKS NICK GOOD MORNING YES AS USUAL THE CHANCELLOR'S RED BOXES LEAKING THE SECRETS THAT IT CHOOSES TO AHEAD OF TOMORROW'S BUDGET
WE'RE BEING TOLD US KNICKERS SAID THAT GEORGE OSBORNE IS GOING TO COMMIT TO SEVERAL HIGH PROFILE AND MUCH NEEDED RAIL AND HOUSING PROJECTS WHEN THAT MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WHEN THE PROJECT'S GET BUILT IS ANOTHER MATTER HOWEVER NOT IMMEDIATELY CERTAINLY NOW THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION HAS SAID AND IT WAS SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT REMEMBER THAT IT WANTS AN IMMEDIATE AND VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN SUCH PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
OR WHO IS GOING TO INVEST LET'S BRING IN MY QUEST TO MAIL THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO INVEST SCHEME CASH INTO SUCH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS MIGHT GOOD MORNING MORNING MATTHEW
WHY FIRST OF ALL MORE GENERALLY TO PENSION FUNDS NEED TO INVEST WANT TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE WELL MATTHEW PENSION SCHEMES HAVE ONE REAL OBJECTIVE AND THAT IS TO BE ABLE TO PAY PENSIONS TO THEIR MEMBERS WHEN THEY FOOLED YOU AND THEY NEED TO BUILD AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DELIVER THE SORTS OF CASH FLOWS THAT CAN ENABLE THEM TO DO THAT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WHICH TO DELIVER
A LONG TERM LOW RISK AND INFLATION LINKED CASH FLOWS ARE A GREAT ASSET TO TO MATCH THOSE PENSION LIABILITIES AND HAVE THEY BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE'VE HAD OVER RECENT YEARS IN THE STOCK MARKETS YES THEY HAVE AND ALSO FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND Q. E. HE ATTRACTION OF INFRASTRUCTURES RISEN BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS GOVERNMENT GUILT SARA ARE YIELDING SO LITTLE AT THE MOMENT AND JUST IN TEN SECONDS WHAT HAVE YOU SET YOURSELVES UP TO DO
PIP IS THERE TO INCREASE COLLABORATION AMONGST PENSION SCHEMES TO FACILITATE INCREASED INVESTMENT BY PENSION SCHEMES INTO YOU CAME FOR STRUCTURE OH KAY SO LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE REPORTS FROM THIS MORNING IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT TENS OF MILLIONS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR HIGH SPEED THREE RAIL LINK BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LEEDS FOR A TRANS PENNINE TUNNEL ALL RELEASING BROWNFIELD SITES FOR MORE HOMES CROSSRAIL IN THE SOUTH OF THESE THE SORT OF PROJECTS THAT YOU THINK PENSION FUND SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN
YES THEY DEFINITELY ARE BUT THE KEY TO ALL THESE PROJECTS IS THAT ALMOST REGARDLESS OF PROJECTS IT'S THE STRUCTURE OF THE RISK AND THE CASH FLOW'S COMING OUT OF THE PROJECTS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS I SAID IF YOU STRUCTURE THE PROJECT'S WHATEVER THEY ARE TO DELIVER LONG TERM LOW RISK INFLATION LINKED CASH FLOAT THEN THERE'LL BE NO SHORTAGE OF PENSION SCHEME CAPITAL LOOKING TO INVEST IN THEM
I NOTED THAT WHAT LAST MONTH THE ONTARIO TEACHERS' PENSION FUND THEY LED A CONSORTIUM WHICH PORT CITY AIRPORT HERE IN LONDON FOR TWO BILLION POUNDS WHY IS IT THAT U.K. PENSION SCHEMES APPEAR TO BE LAGGING BEHIND THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES I THINK MATTHEW REALLY IT'S JUST ABOUT EXPERIENCE THEY CANADIANS AND AUSTRALIANS PENSION SCHEMES HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO INVEST IN STRUCTURE FLIP FOR A LOT LONGER THAN U.K. SCHEME
SO THEY DEVELOPED ADDING SOME EXPERIENCE AND THEY'RE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE RISKS THEY'RE TAKING WHEN THEY BUY THESE LONG TERM ASSETS BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT U.K. PENSION SCHEMES CAT DEVELOPED THAT EXPERTISE AND WE ARE INDEED STARTING BY CATCHING THEM UP AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE IN A SIMILAR POSITION IN YEARS TO COME I JUST WONDER WHY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN YOUR MONEY WHEN HE CAN BORROW
MONEY ITSELF SO CHEAPLY AROUND ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT AT THE MOMENT THAT THAT IS THAT'S TREE THE ISSUE HERE IS THE IMPACT OF THESE MASSIVE PROJECTS ON THE GOVERNMENT BALANCE SHEET AND THAT'S TAKING THE WHOLE PUBLIC FINANCE FINANCES INTO CONSIDERATION JUST AT THE MOMENT YOU'VE GOT ONE BILLION POUNDS OR SO WHICH ACTUALLY IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS ISN'T A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO INVEST
THAT'S CORRECT WE'VE RAISED HELL HELPED MOBILISE A BILLION POUNDS OF PENSION SCHEME CAPITAL THOUGHT FOR PROJECTS IN THE U.K. WE'RE LOOKING TO DO ANOTHER BILLION POUNDS WITHOUT STOP THERE WILL WE'LL KEEP GOING BUT AS I SAY THIS IS ABOUT DEVELOPING THE EXPERTISE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF U.K. PENSION SCHEME TO INVEST IN THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ALL RIGHT MY QUEST AND THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THAT LET'S BRING IN RICHARD DUNBAR WHO'S INVESTMENT DIRECTORATE ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT GOOD MORNING RICHARD GOOD MORNING OTHER ANY OBSTACLES TO THE PRIVATE INVESTORS GETTING INVOLVED WITH PENSION FUND
PENSION SCHEMES PENSION FUNDS IN THIS WAY NOT PARTICULARLY INFRASTRUCTURE IN GENERAL IS BECOMING MUCH MORE POPULAR AND NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE LOW RETURNS AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE PARTICULARLY IN BONN MARKET SOFA PENSION FUNDS OR INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT
LONG TIME LONG TIME LIABILITIES ARE IS AND ENTHUSIASM TO TRY AND SEEK OUT LONG TERM ASSETS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS REALLY FIT THE BILL SO I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE INTEREST IN THIS AREA OVER THAT OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS AND I JUST WONDER YOU KNOW GEORGE OSBORNE WE WERE O.K. THE FIGURES ARE OUT THERE IN THE NEWSPAPERS LET'S NOT ACTUALLY
TALK MONEY UNTIL GEORGE OSBORNE ANNOUNCES IT AND SAYS EXACTLY WHEN IT'S COMING BUT BUT
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE GOVERNMENT MONEY TO LEVERAGE INVESTOR MONEY TO GET MORE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN BRITAIN GOING IN IN THE SHORT TIME THAT THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION WANTS TO SEE THEM HAPPENING I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT OBVIOUSLY GEORGE OSBORNE'S PROBLEM IS AND HE'S GOT QUITE A LOT OF DEBT AT THE MOMENT SO WHILST THAT WOULD BE FABULOUS TO BE ABLE TO BORROW HAD VIRTUALLY ZERO AND TO INVEST AND RETURNING OUR SETS THAT BOTH RETURNED FINANCIALLY AND RETURN TO THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE HE IS QUITE HIGHLY BOARD AT THE MOMENT SO HE'S GOT TO BALANCE
THAT RISK AND REWARD AND I THINK HE WILL AS YOU IMPLY TRY AND IS PRIVATE CAPITAL PUT A LITTLE BIT OF PUBLIC CAPITAL IN AND SEEK INSTITUTIONS LIKE OUR OWN TO TRY AND MATCH THAT OR GREATER
AND TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT IS P.F.I. AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD IN THE IN THE EDUCATION HEALTH SECTS ON THAT ONE I GUESS CAN I CAN I MOVE US ON TO THE BANK OF JAPAN SO LAST MONTH SURPRISE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES EARLIER THIS YEAR AT LEAST
THIS MORNING IT IT DIDN'T FOLLOW UP IT DIDN'T FOLLOW UP WITH MORE STIMULUS ANGLE AND THE REACTION FROM THE MIC AT LEAST IS TO GO DOWN A BIT WELL THEY MET TODAY I THINK I THINK THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE HOW THAT UNPRECEDENTED POLICY SETTING OF FEBRUARY HIGH THAT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS PRIME MINISTER ABBEY'S THREE ARROWS OF FISCAL POLICY MONETARY POLICY AND RESTRUCTURING ARE STILL IN PLACE AT BE FAIR TO SAY THE INVESTORS ARE HAVING TO BE A LITTLE MORE PATIENT THAN THEY THOUGHT TO SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT BOTH ON GROWTH
AND INFLATION SO I THINK THE BANK HAD YOU SITTING ON THEIR HANDS WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THAT STIMULUS POLICY LAST MONTH IS REALLY GOING TO TAKE ANY EFFECT AND SUCH A HOPING HER DOLLS OBVIOUSLY AND SOMETHING ACTUALLY WHICH IS QUITE EYE CATCHING THIS MORNING BEARING IN MIND THE REFERENDUM ON THE E.U. WE HAVE COMING UP WE'VE GOT THE COSMETICS COMPANY AVON A REASONABLY SIZED EMPLOYER ANNOUNCING THAT IT'S GOING TO CUT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED JOBS WORLDWIDE AND IT'S GOING TO MOVE ITS HEADQUARTERS TO BRITAIN
THEY'RE COMMITTING TO BRITAIN WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WHETHER BRITAIN'S GOING TO BE IN OR OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS INTERESTING I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS HERE FIRSTLY AVRIL MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT STERLING IS TEN PER CENT DYING FROM THE SUMMER OF LAST YEAR SO FOR OVERSEAS INVESTORS LOOKING AT THE U.K. IT'S A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO INVEST AND THEN IT WAS AND IT FOLLOWS THE DEUTSCHE BOYCE THE GERMAN STOCK EXCHANGE
THEY ARE PUTTING ITS CARDS ON THE TABLE AS REGARDS A MERGER OF THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE THEY'VE TAKEN THE SAME VIEW THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO INVEST IN THE U.K. OR TIE UP WITH THE U.K. FIRM SO IT DOES SURE THE BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE REFERENDUM AND THERE'S MORE TO INVESTMENT IN THE U.K. THAN JUST THE REFERENDUM
RICHARD DUNBAR THANK YOU SO MUCH I SHOULD JUST BEFORE YOU GO CAN I ASK YOU A REALLY QUICK ONE WHICH MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER WE HAD THOSE CLIMATE TALKS IN PARIS AT THE END OF LAST YEAR SINCE THEN SINCE THAT GLOBAL COMMITMENT TO REDUCING CARBON IN IN A WORD HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCERNIBLE SHIFT ON HOW INVESTORS SEE THE GREEN ECONOMY
I THINK WHAT THERE HAS BEEN A DISCERNIBLE SHIFT IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE WHAT THE OIL PRICE HAS COLLAPSED AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE PRIOR OIL COMPANIES AND SOME OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANIES IMPACTS OF THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OH SINCE THOSE CONFERENCES AT THE END OF LAST YEAR WELL THAT'S INTERESTING AND I ASKED THANKS VERY MUCH I ASK BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TALK SPUDS RIGHT NOW
OR RATHER A MEASURE WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT WHICH LEADS TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF WASTE WASTE WHICH BRITAIN'S MAJOR SUPERMARKETS FOOD SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS ARE COMMITTING TODAY TO REDUCED BY TWENTY PERCENT OVER THE NEXT DECADE WE CREATE FIFTEEN MILLION TONS EACH YEAR OF FOOD WASTE RICHARD SWANN L. IS FROM THE CHARITY RAP WHICH IS COORDINATING THIS MAJOR EFFORT AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO POTATOES WHEN WE TOOK FOOD WASTE WE'RE TALKING EVERYTHING NOT JUST THE FOOD BUT ALSO THE PACKAGING
WE'RE TALKING THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE FIFTY MILLION TONNES REFERRED TO MATTHEW IS ABSOLUTELY JUST FOOD RIGHT O.K. BUT BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEAD AN EFFORT WHICH SEEMS TO BE GATHERING SPEED TO REDUCE ALL WASTE CONNECTED TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ACTUALLY IS REDUCE THE RESOURCES USED IT WITHIN THE FOOD AND DRINK SECTOR BY HER FAITH IN TEN YEARS THAT LEAD TO TEN MILLION TONS LESS FOOD WASTE OVER THAT PERIOD AND AROUND TWENTY MILLION TONNES LESS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVER THAT TIME
IT'S TRYING TO DELIVER A MORE SUSTAINABLE MORES OR SUFFICIENT FOOD SYSTEM FOR US ALL SO LET'S TALK SPUDS BECAUSE I LOVE FORGIVES EXAMPLE AND THIS IS BRILLIANT SO SO WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE ON ON IF WE IF WE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO USE SLIGHTLY BIGGER OR SMALLER POTATOES HOW DOES IT
SO WHAT WANT TO THINGS WE THOUGHT OF THAT THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS ACTUALLY WORKING FROM A FARM RIGHT THE WAY THROUGH TO CONSUMER AND TRY TO OPTIMISE RIGHT ACROSS THAT SUPPLY CHAIN HAS HER WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF CASE STUDIES WHICH ARE LOOKING AT HOW YOU MIGHT DO THAT AND THIS HAS GIVEN US THE SORT OF IMPETUS TO SAY YES WE CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE SO FOR EXAMPLE ON POTATOES WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE WHERE ARE THE BIGGEST RESOURCE USAGE IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE CARBON EMISSIONS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF WASTE
AND WE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE JUST SLIGHTLY CHANGING THE STANDARDS WHICH THE DIAMETER OF POTATO IS CONSIDERED A ONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A ONE SO THIS IS WHAT THE SUPERMARKETS ARE PREPARED TO STICK ON THE SHOW BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT'S THE PREMIUM QUALITY SO YOU FIND THE POTATOES CAN GO FOR DIFFERENT PRICES DEPENDING ON EXACTLY HOW HOW THEY THEY LOOK AT THEIR SIZE AND THAT TWO MILLIMETRE SHIFT COULD HAVE ACTION MEN THE FIVE PER CENT MORE POTATOES WENT INTO THAT TOP
CATEGORY BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS WE NOW SING A BIT OF A SHIFT WITHIN ALL OF THE RETAILERS AND THE BRANDS TO ACTUALLY USING THIS GREAT TASTING VEGETABLES AND ACTUALLY GIVING A SPECIAL PRICES SO THIS WONKY FRUIT AND VEG ARE NOW SEEING MORE AND MORE OF ON OUR SHELVES IS NOW COMING BACK AND GIVING US THE CHOICE TO SAY WHAT DO YOU WANT THE THING AT THE PERFECT ONCE ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE THE SLIGHTLY MISSHAPEN ONCE BUT STILL TASTE ABSOLUTELY GREAT I MEAN QUICK WORD ON SAVINGS SAVINGS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER
PREDICTED THAT AT THE HEART OF A MASSIVE SAVINGS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS IS WHAT WE THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS JUST BY THE SORT OF FIGURES SO IT FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY OF AN AVERAGE FAMILY WITH CHILDREN YOU COULD SAVE UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS A MONTH JUST BY REDUCING SO IT'S ABOUT A YEAR I PICK O.K. GARDEN JUST BY REDUCING THICKEN IT THANKS AND FOR THE INDUSTRY JUST IN A MUCH AROUND FOUR BILLION POUNDS PER YEAR
BY THE END OF THE AGREEMENT HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH GOVERNMENT BUY IN FROM THIS HAVE A LOOK AT ALL THAT ALL THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. ARE SIGNED UP TO BEING PART OF THIS AND WHAT WE THINK THIS WILL REALLY DO IS GIVE US A FRAME SHIFT IN TERMS OF DELIVERING A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM AND INDEED DELIVERING SOME OF THOSE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO RICHARD LOVELY RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THAT'S IT FOR NOW BACK AT SEVEN FIFTEEN WITH SOME NEWS FROM LEGAL AND GENERAL

BUT THERE WAS OF COURSE THAT MAJOR CAVEAT IN WHAT MISTER PUTIN SAID BECAUSE HE DID STRESS THAT BOTH THAT NEW BASED IN ATTACKING AT THE AIRBASE THERE AND ALSO RUSSIA'S NOW CONSIDERABLY INCREASED IMPROVED NAVAL BASE IN TARTARUS THOSE BASES WERE BOTH REMAIN OPERATIONAL AND THAT THERE WILL BE TROOPS THAT BUT OF COURSE YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN EXACTLY HOW MANY RUSSIAN TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED TO SYRIA AND WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY ARE COMING HOME SO THERE IS
THE CHANCE THE CAPACITY FOR RUSSIA TO RETURN TO AIR STRIKES TO RETURN TO ITS MILITARY OPERATIONS IF IT DEEMS THAT NECESSARY BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE MESSAGE AND PRESIDENT PUTIN IS THAT THE OPERATION THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ACCOMPLISHED THE MISSION'S ACCOMPLISHED ON THE RUSSIAN TROOPS CAN COME HOME ALTHOUGH I STILL HOLDS TERRITORY IN SYRIA SIGNIFICANT TERRITORY
IT DOES AND IF YOU TAKE RUSSIA'S AIMS IN SYRIA AT SURFACE LEVEL THEN PRESIDENT PETE INSTEAD THAT RUSSIA WENT INTO SYRIA TO FIGHT ISLAMIC STATE AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS AS HE PUT IT AND OF COURSE THOSE THOSE GROUPS ARE STILL THERE AND AS YOU SAY D'YOU STILL HOT TERRITORY
MY BOOTS AND IS SAYING THAT RUSSIA'S PRESENCE THERE THOUGH HAS TURNED THE TIDE VERY SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST THOSE GROUPS IF YOU REMEMBER FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO WHEN RUSSIAN TROOPS FIRST RUSSIAN FORCES FIRST BEGAN THE AIR STRIKES PRESIDENT ASAD WAS HIS REGIME HIS HIS FORCES WERE ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE AND CERTAINLY IN IN A MILITARY SENSE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA NOW RUSSIAN RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN SYRIA HAS CERTAINLY HAD CHANGED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY NOW
AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE DEFENCE MINISTRY HERE SYRIAN TROOPS BACKED BY RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES HAVE WE TAKEN SOME FOUR HUNDRED TOWNS AND VILLAGES FROM ISIS AND FROM OTHER GROUPS THEY THEY DO HAVE THE UPPER HAND OUT SO I THINK MILITARILY PRESIDENT PUTIN IS PRESENTING MISSUS THAT'S AS A SUCCESS I THINK ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY AT POLITICALLY
IT'S SEEN HERE AS A SUCCESS AS WELL NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE SYRIAN THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I THINK ALSO IN TERMS OF RUSSIA REASSERTING ITSELF ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE AND OF COURSE AFTER THE HUGE CRISIS IN RELATIONS WITH THE WEST OVER THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE I THINK THIS IS ALSO ABOUT RUSSIA TRYING TO RETURN TO THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE AND FORCING THE WEST TO DEAL WITH RUSSIA PERHAPS AS AN EQUAL AGAIN SERRA EYNSFORD IN MOSCOW THANK YOU TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN
JUST DAYS AFTER NORTH KOREA WAS SANCTIONED BY THE UNITED NATIONS THE COUNTRY'S LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS ORDERED A NUCLEAR WARHEAD TEST AND BALLISTIC MISSILE LAUNCHES ITS PART OF A DAILY RATCHETING UP OF THE THREATS AGAINST BOTH UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE ITS NEIGHBOUR SOUTH KOREA FROM WHERE STEVE EVANS ASSHOLE CORRESPONDENT JOINS US IT DOES SEEMED STEVE AS IF IN DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY NORTH KOREA DOES WANT TO RAISE THE STAKES
THIS HAPPENS AT THIS TIME EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THERE ARE BIG EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY THE U.S. AND THE SOUTH KOREAN MILITARY BUT HAVING SAID ALL THAT THIS TENSION IS PARTICULARLY HIGH AND WE DID HAVE THE FOURTH NUCLEAR TEST BACK IN JANUARY
TO HAVE A CREDIBLE NUCLEAR THREAT YOU NEED TO DO VARIOUS THINGS YOU HAVE TO BLOW UP THE BOMB FIRST OR THEY'VE DONE THAT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A ROCKET THAT CAN RE ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE HE SAID TODAY WE'VE NOW GOT THAT MATERIAL YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BOMB SMALL ENOUGH TO PUT A NUT ON A ROCKET HE SAID LAST WEEK WE'VE DONE THAT WITH A FOCAL IT DOES
HE DID I MEAN IT LOOKED A BIT I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS A BIT ODD THE ROOM ALMOST LIKE THE BURMA PETER SELLERS IT WAS A ROUND OBJECT WITH KIM JONG ON STANDING OVER IT WHETHER IT WAS A MOCK UP OR NOT WE DO NOT KNOW THERE IS SOME SCEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER THE TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITIES OF NORTH KOREA MATCH
THE WORDS OF THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER BUT WE DO KNOW HE CAN MAKE BOMBS AND WE KNOW THAT HE IS MAKING STEADY PROGRESS
MAYBE FAST PROGRESS TOWARDS HAVING ALL THE OTHER BITS OF THE JIGSAW THERE HE SAYS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TEST IT'S NOT ROUTINE BUT YOU'RE MAKING CLOSE PRETTY COMMONPLACE THESE THREATS GIVES A SENSE OF HOW IT FEELS WHERE YOU ARE STAY WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU DAY AFTER DAY ABOUT THIS GREAT CONTEST BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE OVER GO WITH THAT GAME WHICH IS A BIGGER STORY HE SORTS OF THREATS OR THAT EXTRAORDINARY GAME BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND THE AND THE GO PLAY
I THINK GO IS A BIGGER STORY I WENT OUT TO DO A BIT OF A TALK ABOUT THE NUCLEAR THING ABOVE ME WAS A GREAT BIG SCREEN WITH HER FIFTH AND FINAL GO MATCH GOING ON
PEOPLE GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS THEY DO NOT THINK OH DEAR WE'RE AT WAR HE SAID HE'S MAKING THESE BLOODCURDLING THREATS WE BETTER STOCK UP BOND ON TINS OF BAKED BEANS OR KIMCHI OR THEY DO NOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S
AN EMPTY THREAT THEY THINK IT'S SABRE RATTLING NOW MAYBE HE CAN CRY WOLF ONCE TOO OFTEN BUT GO IS WHAT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT WELL IF AS A RESULT IN THAT MATCH WILL COME BACK TO YOU LATER
THAT I WAS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN MORE PUBLIC SPENDING CUTS MAY BE ON THEIR WAY IN THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET TOMORROW BUT GEORGE OSBORNE IS LETTING IT BE KNOWN THAT HE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO SPEND MANY MORE MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS POTENTIALLY IN THE LONG TERM BILLIONS ON BUILDING ROAD AND RAIL LINKS AND ON HOUSING TO NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANCE POLITICAL EDITOR REALLY NORMAN YOU LOOK AT THESE PRESS RELEASES NEAR THEY WERE QUITE WHEN WILL THIS MONEY BE SPENT HOW MUCH OF IT IS NEW
WELL THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW THE MONEY THAT'S BEING ANNOUNCED TODAY IS PRIMARILY FOR EXPLORATORY WORK PREPARATORY WORK CONSULTATIONS DEVELOPMENT WORK BUT IT IS THE START OF A PROCESS WHICH CERTAINLY SOUNDS BIG SO THE CHANCELLOR IS TALKING ABOUT TRANSFORMATIVE ROAD AND RAIL PROJECTS MANY OF THEM FOCUSED ON
THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SO HE'S TALKING ABOUT PRESSING AHEAD WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LEEDS IS TALKING ABOUT BUILDING A ROAD TUNNEL BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND SHEFFIELD IT'S TALKING ABOUT UPGRADES TO THE M. SIXTY TWO BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND LEEDS AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT GIVING THE GO AHEAD TO CROSSRAIL IN LONDON THE UNDERGROUND LINE GOING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL BUT IT IS SORT OF FEED MONEY TO START THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT WHETHER THIS CAN ALL BE DONE CERTAINLY A LOT OF THIS MONEY
HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN ANNOUNCED AND I SUSPECT FAR FROM THE SWAY AGEING NORTHERN COUNCIL LEADERS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROJECT BY FAR THE BIGGEST PROJECT IS CROSSRAIL
IN LONDON SO I SUSPECT MANY NORTHERN LEADERS MIGHT FEEL AGGRIEVED THAT ONCE AGAIN LONDON SEEMS TO BE GETTING THE LARGEST SLICE OF THIS HERE THE NORTHERN GETS THE HEADLINES DOESN'T IT BUT I THINK IT'S ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE MONEY FOR CROSSRAIL TOO NEVER MIND CROSSRAIL WHAT WHICH IS BEING PROMISED BY THE CHANCE TO DOUBLE THEIR MONEY THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON THAT MUCH TALKED OF LINK BETWEEN MANCHESTER IN LATE AND IN THE END OF THE DAY IT DOES COME DOWN TO MONEY AND WE KNOW BLUNTLY THE CHANCELLOR DOESN'T HAVE ANY CASH
HE'S ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION ADRIFT AND CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE MASSIVELY MASSIVELY EXPENSIVE HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE SCOPE TO BORROW BECAUSE HE'S COMMITTED TO BALANCING THE BOOKS BY TWENTY TWENTY AND EVEN IF YOU WERE TO DO SO THEN THAT WOULD MEAN PRETTY MUCH IMITATING JOHN MACDONALD'S DOING SO HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT AND YOU KNOW THE BLUNT TRUTH IS A RECORD ON INFRASTRUCTURE
HE'S PRETTY LAMENTABLE GOING BACK YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS WE ARE GREAT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT FANTASTIC SCHEMES BUT ACTUALLY DELIVERING THEM WE ARE WOEFUL AND YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THE AIRPORT CAPACITY IN THE SOUTHEAST WE TALKED ABOUT THAT BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT AND THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF A RESOLUTION THOSE CATTLE TRUCKS ON THE MANCHESTER TO LEEDS LINE AND ON THE M. SIXTY TWO BUT THEY'RE CHEERING THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS ARE BEING HELD BY MACEDONIAN POLICE AFTER MANAGING TO CROSS INTO THE COUNTRY FROM GREECE
AFTER WADING THROUGH A RIVER A CORRESPONDENT DANNY SAVAGES ON THAT BORDER BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND JOINS US NOW DANNY THEY FOUND A WAY AROUND THE BARBED WIRE FENCE
YES MICHELLE THEY'D SET OFF FROM THAT WELL PUBLICISED ALL THE PICTURES THAT WE'VE SEEN OF IT A MEANIE CAMP ON THE BORDER BETWEEN GRISSOM GREECE OR MACEDONIA YESTERDAY THE CONDITIONS ARE APPALLING IT'S TURNED INTO A FLOODED FIELD BASICALLY AND PEOPLE HAVE JUST GOT FED UP
THE MIGRANTS STARTED MARCHING ACROSS COUNTRY IF YOU LIKE TOWARDS THE MACEDONIAN BORDER IT WAS A FIVE OR SIX MILE WALK DURING WHICH THEY HAD TO CROSS A RIVER SOMEBODY SLUNG A ROPE ACROSS AS A GUIDE ROPE AND THEY USE THAT CHILDREN WERE PUT ON PEOPLE'S SHOULDERS AND CARRIED ACROSS PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS TO AND THEN THEY HEADED TOWARDS THE MACEDONIAN FRONTIER THEY FOUND A STRETCH WHERE THERE WAS NO BARBED WIRE FENCE HOWEVER THE MACEDONIAN AUTHORITY SOON ROUNDED THEM ALL UP AND WE'RE FINDING OUT THIS MORNING WE'RE GETTING MESSAGES FROM THE CAMP THEY'VE ALL BEEN SORT OF
PROCESSED STRAIGHTAWAY AND SENT STRAIGHT BACK TO GREECE SO THEY'RE ALL BACK IN THE CAMP IN THE MEDIA THIS MORNING THOSE PEOPLE WHO WENT ON THAT LONG WALK PROBABLY TELLING EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CAMP WHAT HAPPENS SO WHETHER WE'LL SEE A REPEAT TODAY OR NOT OF WHAT HAPPENED I DOUBT IT I THINK THE WORD IS OUT THAT IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OF A FRUITLESS EFFORT IT'S ALSO RAINING QUITE HEAVILY HERE AGAIN SO IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP THE MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES THEREFORE MADE THE DECISION NOT TO ALLOW THEM TO PROCEED TO SEND THEM BACK EXACTLY THE WAY THEY'D COME
YES REMEMBER JUST OVER A WEEK AGO THE MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES FIRE TEAR GAS ON MIGRANTS WHO WERE STORMING THE BORDER GATE AT THE CAMP AND THE MIGRANT BASICALLY HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE THEY ARE EITHER TRY AND KEEP GOING FORWARD THEY ALL WANT TO GET TO GERMANY OR THEY RETREAT AND STAY IN CAMPS IN GREECE AND THEIR BASIC PHILOSOPHY IS THIS THEY'VE SPENT
ALL THAT MONEY GETTING AS FAR AS GREECE THEY'VE HAD THAT VERY DANGEROUS SEA CROSSING WHICH AGAIN THEY'VE PAINT SPENDS A LOT OF MONEY ON AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP NOW THEY'D NOT GOING TO BE THWARTED BY ONE BORDER FENCE WE WERE UP THERE LAST NIGHT IN THE DARKNESS AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A RUSTLING IN THE BUSHES AND THERE WAS TWO OR THREE YOUNG FAMILIES WALKING THROUGH TRYING TO FIND A WAY ACROSS THE BORDER
AND THIS REALLY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE BORDER GATE SHUTTING SHUTTING ALL THE WAY UP THE BALKANS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES THERE'S SPIRIT ISN'T BROKEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP TRYING DANNY SAVAGE THANK YOU
IT IS NINETY MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS A STUDY BY THE GUARDIAN AS FOUND THE COUPLES LIVING IN RENTED ACCOMMODATION OR HINDERED FROM HAVING CHILDREN IN TWO THIRDS OF THE U.K. BECAUSE THEY PAY SO MUCH OF THEIR INCOME TO THEIR LANDLORD IN ENGLAND THE NORTH WEST THE NORTH EASTERN YORKSHIRE NUMBER ARE DEEMED TO BE THE ONLY AFFORDABLE AREAS THE BABIES FROM PAGE CONTRAST THE STRUGGLES OF SO CALLED GENERATION Y. TO GET ON THE HOUSING LADDER WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF TONY BLAIR AND HIS FAMILY THE CHILDREN OF THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER SAID TO BENEFIT FROM A PROPERTY EMPIRE
WORTH TWENTY SEVEN MILLION POUNDS TOMORROW'S BUDGET IS WIDELY PREVIEWED THE CHANCELLOR RECEIVING A WELL DONE FROM THE DAILY EXPRESS FOR HIS PLANS TO INCREASE RAIL INVESTMENT THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS MORE CAUTIOUS ARGUING SUCH GRAND PROMISES HAD BECOME A FAMILIAR PART OF POLITICS IT CITES INDECISION OVER A THIRD RUNWAY AT HEATHROW IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW BRITAIN IS TOO SLOW TO AUTHORISE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND URGES THE GOVERNMENT DON'T BLUBBER
BUILD WILLIAM HAGUE IS TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE VERY WORST THING THAT GEORGE OSBORNE COULD DO WOULD BE TO DEVIATE FROM HIS PLAN TO CUT FOUR BILLION POUNDS FROM PUBLIC SPENDING WHY DEAR COMMENT PIECE THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY ARGUES THE LACK OF STEADINESS IN THE POLICIES OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTRAL BANKS IS A BIGGER THREAT TO ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE THAN SPENDING CUTS
HE DESCRIBES MISTER OSBORNE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT POLITICAL MIND OF HIS GENERATION AND CONCLUDES THAT HE'S BRIGHT ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT STEADY CONSISTENCY IS BEST NOT JUST FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR THE COUNTRY TOO
THE DAILY MAIL REPORTS THAT BIG FIRMS ARE SLASHING OVERTIME AND RECRUITMENT TO PAY FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S NEW LIVING WAGE COMPANIES SUCH AS TESCO B. AND Q. AND WHITBREAD ARE ALL SAID TO BE TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS AHEAD OF THE FIFTY PENCE AN HOUR PAY RISE WHICH TAKES EFFECT NEXT MONTH A DRAMATIC SURGE IN THE EARTH'S SURFACE TEMPERATURE LAST MONTH IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE INDEPENDENT WHICH SAYS THE UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE WAS THE BIGGEST MONTH ON MONTH RISE IN GLOBAL WARMING ON RECORD FIGURES RELEASED BY NESSA SHOW FEBRUARY
THERE'S NOUGHT POINT TWO CELSIUS WARMER THAN JANUARY WHICH HELD THE PREVIOUS MONTHLY TEMPERATURE RECORD AND THE TOP GEAR PRESENTER CHRIS EVANS IS DESCRIBED AS A DOUGHNUT BY THE SUN FOLLOWING HIS APOLOGY FOR THE FILMING OF WHEEL SPINS NEAR THE CENOTAPH THE PAPER SAYS THE STUNT COST LICENCE FEE PAYERS
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT WILL BE DROPPED THE DAILY MAIL CLAIMS THE B. B. C. FAILED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO FILM THE SEQUENCER AND SUGGEST THAT MISTER EVANS LOOKED DRAINED AS HE LEFT WORK YESTERDAY IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN OUR MAIN HEADLINE THIS MORNING MOSCOW SAYS THAT RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL IN SYRIA OR BECOME PACKING THEIR EQUIPMENT AFTER PRESIDENT PUTIN ORDERED TO WITHDRAW
AND MOVING ON TO YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT THE GOVERNMENT DISMISSED LABOUR'S CALLS YESTERDAY FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER THE JUSTICE SECRETARY WAS THE SOURCE OF A SUN NEWSPAPER STORY CLAIMING THE QUEEN WANTS THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. THE LEADER OF THE COMMONS CHRIS GRAYLING TOLD M.P.S THE PRESS WALKS DOG WAS INVESTIGATING AND NO FURTHER ACTION WAS NEEDED HERE IS A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
LABOUR DEMANDED INVESTIGATION AND RESIGNATION IF NOT ACTUAL DECAPITATION OF WITH THE SUN NEWSPAPER REPORT WHICH CLAIMED THE QUEEN HAD EXPRESSED ANTI E.U. VIEWS AT A LUNCH WITH PRIVY COUNCILLORS THE QUEEN'S VIEWS ON POLITICAL MATTERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY PRIVATE SO WHO HAD SPILLED THE BEANS BUT THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE CHRIS GRAYLING HAD A RESPONSE HE SAID IT WAS ALL MADE UP AND HE WAS STICKING TO THAT ANSWER
EVERY TIME THE STORY'S CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE MY PREDECESSOR SAID THAT THE STORY WAS CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE AS TORIA'S CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE THE STORY'S CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING TO ANSWER
JUST A SELECTION CHRIS GRILLING GAVE THE SAME REPLY AT LEAST TEN TIMES IN UNDER TWENTY MINUTES BUT BEFORE THEY STARTED THE SPEAKER JOHN BERKEL REMINDED M.P.S THAT IT WAS NOT WITHIN THE RULES FOR THE COMMONS TO DISCUSS WHAT THE QUEEN MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT THINK
I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT HONOURABLE MEMBERS WILL SPARE ME THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HAVING TO STOP THEM IN THEIR TRACKS
IF THEY SEEK TO DRAW TO THE HOUSE'S ATTENTION ANY ALLEGED VIEWS OF THE MONARCH ON THE Y. YOU OR INDEED ANYTHING ELSE SO LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON WAS CAREFUL BUT HE THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION THREE MEMBERS HAVE CATEGORICALLY DENIED
BUT THEY ARE THE SOURCE OF THE JUSTICE THEY ARE THEY ALL THERE
JUST HIS SECRETARIES AS ONLY SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW THE SUN GOT ALL ITS INFORMATION
HARDLY CATEGORIC THE JUSTICE SECRETARY MICHAEL GOULD WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER TOM WATSON INSISTED THE PUBLIC HAD THE RIGHT TO KNOW IF MISTER GOULD HAD BROKEN HIS PRIVY COUNCIL OATH OF CONFIDENTIALITY ONLY THE MINISTER OR THE PRIME MINISTER CAN ALL OF THAT INVESTIGATION
A COVER UP WILL NOT DO
SURELY ANY MEMBER OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL WHO WAS A SOURCE OF THIS STORY OR WHO SPECIAL ADVISER ALL RIGHT I WAS STANDS IN CONTEMPT FOR HIS PRIVY COUNCIL
AND SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE IF HE WON'T HONOURABLY RESIGNED HIMSELF
ACCORDING TO THE SUN THE QUEEN'S REMARKS HAD BEEN DIRECTED AT THE FORMER DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NICK CLEGG MISTER CLEGG THE M.P. FOR SHEFFIELD HALLAM HAS CALLED THE SUN'S REPORTS NONSENSE AND GIVEN THAT CHRIS GRAYLING FELT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING TO SEE AND EVERYBODY SHOULD MOVE ON THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR SHEFFIELD HALLAM HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT THE STORY IT WAS CATEGORICALLY UNTRUE
AS THE HOUSE IS AWARE BUCKINGHAM PALACE HAS REFERRED THE MATTER TO THE NEW PRESS COMPLAINTS BODY IT IS NOW INVESTIGATING THE STORY
GIVEN ALL THIS MISTER SPEAKER I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY NEED FOR FURTHER ACTION
THE CONSERVATIVE LIAM FOX WHO LIKE MICHAEL GO FROM CHRIS GRAYLING IS IN FAVOUR OF AN EXIT FROM THE E.U. WANTED LABOUR TO LEAVE MY GOLF ALONE WHAT WE'RE WITNESSING IS HE POORLY DISGUISED
OF THE TENDENCY OF THE PARTY OPPOSITE TO PLAY THE MAN NOT THE BALL BOUNCES AND WILLY FATHER AGREE
THE WORKINGS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL FIERY MATTER FOR THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND I'M NOT THE SAME RULES THAT APPLIED TO MINISTERS WHO ANTHONY
CHRIS GRAYLING GAVE A VARIATION OF HIS STANDARD REPLY BUT ONE SOME M.P.S FOUND INTRIGUING THE CONVERSATION WHICH IS ALLEGED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHAT'S THE FORM OF THE PRESIDENT SAID DID NOT TAKE PLACE OUT TO DID NOT TAKE PLACE I DO PRIVY COUNCIL MEETING
THERE WAS A STIRRER SOME M.P.S WONDERED HOW HE COULD BE SO SPECIFIC ABOUT WHERE IT HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE IF IT HADN'T TAKEN PLACE BUT THIS WAS GETTING WAY TOO METAPHYSICAL FOR AFTER LUNCH AND ALL THIS TALK OF WHAT THE QUEEN DID OR DIDN'T SAY TO WHOM WAS PERHAPS MAKING SOME M.P.S FEEL A LITTLE LEFT OUT THE CONSERVATIVE PEWTER BOWL MUSE SADLY I'M NOT A MEMBER PRIVY COUNCIL NOT LIKE YOU
LABOUR'S DENNIS SKINNER HAS NOT BEEN MADE A PRIVY COUNSELLOR RIVA I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THIS PART OF US SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TAKES PLACE BUT THE MOST BIZARRE THING FOR ME
WHAT ON EARTH WAS THAT QUEEN DOING FROM HIGH IN
NICK CLEGG WAS NOT IN THE CHAMBER BUT HIS STORIES SURELY ALWAYS OPEN IF MY SKIN SKINNER EVER FEELS HE DOES NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SUSAN HUME REPORTING THERE YOU CAN HEAR MORE OF COURSE ARE FROM YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT SHORTLY AFTER HOPPER STATE OVER ON ONE NINETY EIGHT LONG WAVE AND ON DIGITAL RADIO
THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN NEARLY ONE HUNDRED OF THE U.K.'S FOOD MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS INCLUDING ALL THE MAJOR SUPERMARKETS HAVE COMMITTED TO HER NEW PLAN TO CUT FOOD WASTE BY TWENTY PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE MILLION TONNES OF FOOD ARE WASTED IN THE E.U. EVERY YEAR WITH THE U.K. THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER STATE WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE CAMPAIGNER TRISTRAM STUART WHO WROTE A BOOK CALLED WASTE UNCOVERING THE GLOBAL FOOD SCANDAL GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING A WELCOME ANNOUNCEMENT
OF COURSE IT IS A WELCOME ANNOUNCEMENT AND IT DOES SHOW THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM IS LEADING GLOBALLY ON THE ISSUE OF FOOD WASTE REDUCTION WE HAVE A UNITED NATIONS GOAL TO WHOLE FOOD WASTE BY TWENTY THIRTY AND IF YOU ALLOWED THE UNITED KINGDOM TO START FROM ITS TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BASELINE SO GOING RETROSPECTIVELY BACK A FEW YEARS WE WILL BE ON TARGET TO MEET THAT GOAL WHICH IS
QUITE IMPRESSIVE PLATE O.K. SO
ALL A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHERE WHERE IS MOST OF THE WASTE HAPPENING IT'S MOSTLY IN OUR HOMES ISN'T IT IT'S THERE IT'S THE DECISIONS WE MAKE HER NOT TO USE UP BORDERS SITTING IN A KITCHEN SITTING IN OUR FRIDGES WE DO HAVE A LOT OF LEFTOVERS TO EAT UP WHAT'S VERY EXCITING ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT IS THAT FINALLY AFTER YEARS OF CAMPAIGNING ON THIS SUBJECT FEEDBACK THE ORGANISATION I FOUNDED HAS BEEN PUSHING THE SUPERMARKETS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY NOT JUST FOR THE
FOOD THAT THEY THROW IN THEIR BINS BUT THE FOOD THAT THEY CAUSE THEIR SUPPLIES IN PARTICULAR FARMERS TO WASTE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE PUBLIC OUTCRY ON THE ISSUE OF FOOD WASTE ON FARMS WE'VE SEEN HUGH FEARNLEY WHITTINGSTALL ZE PROGRAMME WHICH I HELPED WITH
DEMONSTRATE THAT SUPERMARKET POLICIES ARE PUTTING FARMERS OUT OF BUSINESS BRITISH PRODUCE TO BE DUMPED BY THE ONE KEY VEGETABLES UGLIER ONES VEGETABLES ARE PART OF IT BUT THAT REALLY IS ONLY PART OF IT IT'S ALSO FORECAST CHANGES AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS THAT RESULT IN U.K. FARMERS AND INDEED FARMERS OVERSEAS DUMPING PERFECTLY GOOD FOOD BECAUSE THE SUPERMARKETS HAVE SAID AT THE LAST MINUTE ACTUALLY BE THEY DON'T WANT IT AND THIS AGREEMENT THEY DON'T WANT IT BECAUSE
PEOPLE LIKE US ARE OFTEN NOT PREPARED TO BUY IT SO THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM HAVE CHANGED THEIR POLICIES ON THAT THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY WERE RESPONDING TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES IF THAT WAS THE ONLY PROBLEM GOING ON THAT WOULD BE A LESS PROBLEM THAN WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT ACTUALLY SUPERMARKETS ARE AT LIBERTY AND DO REGULARLY CHOOSE TO INSTEAD OF BUYING THE BACON BEANS THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO BUY FROM KENYAN GROWS
GO TO GUATEMALA OR INSTEAD OF BUYING BRITISH CAULIFLOWERS DECIDE TO IMPORT SOME FRENCH ONES AND IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH THEY PLAY DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS OFF EACH OTHER THAT FRANKLY ABUSES THE PROUD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SUPPLIERS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH PARLIAMENT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE GROCERIES CODE ADJUDICATOR ACT WHICH PREVENTS
SOME OF THESE PRACTICES OR TRIES TO AND WHAT WE NEED TO SEE NOW IS
BUT GROCERIES CODE ADJUDICATOR TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL OF THIS CODE AND WASTING FOOD BY CAUSING YOUR SUPPLIER TO THROW AWAY FOOD IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SUPERMARKETS HAVE CONTINUED TO DO YEAR AFTER YEAR THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME UNDERTAKES TO MEASURE
FOOD WASTE ON U.K. FARMS THAT WILL BE THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO DO IT AND THAT IS A VERY WELCOME STEP AND I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A CRISIS REACTION TO THE PUBLIC OUTCRY I THINK WE CONSUMERS CITIZENS HAVE REALLY SHOWN SUPERMARKETS THAT WE DO CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER FOR A CUSTOM
IF THEY WANT US TO CONTINUE BUYING IN THEIR STORES THEY'VE GOT TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE ON FARMS TRISTRAM STUART THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN IT'S PRETTY MUCH AN IRON RULE OF POLITICS POLITICIANS FACING ELECTIONS PROMISE NOT TO RAISE TAXES BUT IN THEIR BUDGETS THAT FOLLOW ELECTIONS UP GO TAXES THIS IS WHAT THE CHANCELLOR SAID IN HIS BUDGET LAST YEAR JUST A FEW WEEKS AFTER POLLING
WE PROMISED THE BRITISH PEOPLE AT THE ELECTION THAT WE WOULD INTRODUCE A TAX LOCK TO PROHIBIT ANY INCREASE IN THE MAIN RATES OF INCOME TAX NATIONAL INSURANCE OF V.A.T. FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE WILL NOT ONLY KEEP THAT PROMISE BUT LEGISLATE FOR IT IN THE COMING WEEKS OUR PRIORITY IS NOT TO RAISE TAXES ON WORKING PEOPLE IT IS TO CUT
GEORGE OSBORNE'S CRITICS ACCUSE HIM AS PREVIOUS CHANCELLORS OF USING STEALTH TAXES TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN RHETORIC AND REALITY SO COULD YOU DO IT IN HIS BUDGET AGAIN TOMORROW JOHN CULLINAN IS TAX POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE OF TAXATION AND JOINS US DO YOU THINK HE IS GUILTY OF DOING STEALTH TAXES OR ARE WE GUILTY OF SAYING THAT ANYTHING THAT ISN'T A HEADLINE RATE RISES STEALTHY EVEN THOUGH THEY GET PLENTY OF PUBLICITY
I THINK A BIT OF BOTH I MEAN CLEARLY THERE WAS LAST AUTUMN THE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY WHICH IS KIND OF ALL BUT AN INCREASING EMPLOYERS' NATIONAL INSURANCE VERY VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES AND O.K. HYPOXIC ATED TO APPRENTICESHIP SPENDING
I THINK THAT FAIRLY QUALIFIES AS A STEALTH TAX PART IS THE LABELLING ISN'T IT IF YOU CALL IT AN APPRENTICESHIP LEVITT WHEN WHO CAN OBJECT TO A LEVY FOR A PRINCESS BUT IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS YOU CAN'T COS IT JUST BUT YOU TAX BUT NOT EXACTLY SO I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS SIGNIFICANT TAX ONGOING GOING TAX INCREASES ANNOUNCED UNDER GEORGE OSBORNE'S CHANCELLORSHIP
PROBABLY ABOUT HALF OF THEM HAVE SOME KIND OF FAIRNESS TYPE JUSTIFICATION SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING UP STAMP DUTY OVERALL WE'RE PUTTING IT UP FOR PEOPLE WHO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE HOUSES OR A SECOND HOUSE OR A BUY TO LET HOUSE THAT WILL HELP FOR FIRST TIME BUYERS AND SO YOU GET A LOT OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS
PENSIONS AND OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL AND WHAT YOU CAN DO IS SOMETIMES CUT RATES LIKE ON CORPORATION TAX BUT THEN CLAW IT BACK IN OTHER WAYS YES EXACTLY THE CORPORATION TAX TAKE IS REMARKABLY STABLE CONSIDERING ALL THE CONCERN THERE IS OF A MULTINATIONAL AVOIDANCE OF THE FACT THAT THE RATE IS BEING BROUGHT DOWN THE PROJECTED TAKE IS VERY VERY STABLE INDEED AND THAT IN PART REFLECTS PARTICULAR INCREASES LIKE A SURCHARGE FOR BANKS
TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE BANKS' ABILITY TO OFFSET LOSSES REDUCING CAPITAL OUNCE RATES AND SO ON IT'S IN PART ISN'T IT BECAUSE THAT SOUND BITE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE CHANCELLOR IS DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA SEEM OFTEN TO BE HORRIFIED BY THE IDEA OF ANY RACE EVER GOING UP SO HE HAS TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE INSURANCE TAX WHICH IT LOOKS PRETTY CLEAN GOING TO LOOK AT AGAIN TOMORROW YES AGAIN OF THE FORTY BILLION PROBABLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THEM ARE KIND OF I'VE GOT A KIND OF SEXUAL FLAVOUR BY THE BANKING INSURANCE
OIL COMPANIES IN BETTER DAYS FOR THE OIL PRICE MAYBE WHO KNOWS FUEL DUTY NOW WE SHALL SEE THIS INSURANCE TAX WHICH WE PAY OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE WANT INSURANCE FOR A CAR A HOLIDAY OR WHATEVER HOUSE JUST HOW MUCH MONEY IS IT RAISING FOUR
I THINK I AM NOT I'M NOT QUITE SURE OVERALL THE INCREASE ANNOUNCED LAST SUMMER WAS ONE POINT SIX BILLION SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AN INCREASE OF A SIMILAR AMOUNT YEAH WHICH SMALL CHANGE MORE THAN SMALL CHANGE S. I MEAN LOST LAST SUMMER
IN THE BUDGET BUT WE DID THERE WERE ABOUT TEN BILLION OF THESE VARIOUS TAX INCREASES OF ONE TYPE OR ANOTHER AND THAT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE SIGNIFICANT ONES IN THE WHOLE OF HIS CHANCELLORSHIP IS WHO YOU WOULD FIND HIM GUILTY PERHAPS ALONG WITH OTHER CHANCES OF HER BEING A STEALTH TAX WHAT WELL APART FOR THE APPRENTICESHIP LEVY THAT THEY HAVE IT IT'S NEVER BEEN DISGUISED THEY ARE TAXES
BUT THEY'RE NOT HEADLINE RATES ARE NOT THE ONES THAT YOU NOTICE STRAIGHTAWAY JOHN KELLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR JOINING THE CHANCELLOR'S BUDGET OF COURSE

THE HEAD OF THE U.S. ARMY IN EUROPE SAID RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN UKRAINE AND ITS INTERVENTION IN SYRIA HAD THREATENED EUROPE'S SECURITY HE REPEATED THE ACCUSATION THAT RUSSIA HAD WEAPONISED THE MIGRANT CRISIS BY FORCING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO FLEE TO EUROPE
IN THAT CONTEXT HE SAID HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF BRITAIN'S REFERENDUM ON E.U. MEMBERSHIP FOR THE NATO ALLIANCE GENERAL HODGES SAID THAT MANY OF AMERICA'S CLOSEST ALLIES WERE MEMBERS OF THE E.U.

AN ITALIAN PROSECUTOR HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. AND BUZZ FEED NEWS THAT MORE THAN TWO DOZEN TOP TENNIS PLAYERS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BECAUSE THEIR NAMES APPEARED IN EVIDENCE SEIZED FROM GAMBLERS ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO FIX MATCHES THE LIST INCLUDES TWO PLAYERS WHO HAVE BEEN RANKED IN THE WORLD'S TOP TWENTY THE PROSECUTOR IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF CREMONA HAS BEEN CONDUCTING A TWO YEAR INQUIRY INTO A SUSPECTED MATCH FIXING RING INVOLVING ITALIAN TENNIS PLAYERS AND GAMBLERS SIMON COX REPORT
THE CREMONA PROSECUTOR ROBERTO DE MARTINO HAS OBTAINED EXTENSIVE INTERNET CHAT LOGS AND RECORDINGS OF PHONE CALLS BETWEEN PLAYERS AND GAMBLERS
HE SAYS OVER TWO DOZEN INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS ARE MENTIONED BY THE GAMBLERS AND THAT IF THEY WERE ITALIAN THERE WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED
MY DE MARTINO SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO PURSUE THESE PLAYERS BUT THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY TENNIS'S INTEGRITY UNIT WHICH WAS SET UP TO PROTECT THE SPORT FROM BETTING RELATED CORRUPTION
THE TENNIS INTEGRITY UNIT SAID ANY NEW EVIDENCE WILL BE LOOKED AT BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW SET UP BY THE SPORT FOLLOWING THE REVELATIONS BY THE B. B. AND BUZZ FEED NEWS IN JANUARY BUT TENNIS HAD FAILED TO ACT ON REPEATED WARNINGS ABOUT SIXTEEN TOP LEVEL PLAYERS INVOLVED IN SUSPICIOUS MATCHES
A COMMITTEE OF M.P.S SAYS MINISTER SHOULD CONSIDER GIVING SOME WOMEN EARLY ACCESS TO THEIR STATE PENSIONS IF THEY ACCEPT REDUCED PAYMENTS THE PROPOSAL WOULD APPLY TO THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO SAY THEY WERE GIVEN INSUFFICIENT WARNING THAT THE AGE AT WHICH THEY COULD START TAKING THEIR PENSIONS WAS BEING INCREASED THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT HAD ALREADY ACTED TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IN SIMON GOBLETS
THE PENSION AGE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IS RISING IN STAGES TO SIXTY SIX BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY BUT THE IMPACT IS MOST DRAMATIC ON WOMEN WHO USED TO BE ABLE TO RETIRE AT SIXTY AND ESPECIALLY ON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS BORN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES THE WORK AND PENSIONS SELECT COMMITTEE SAYS MORE COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO WARN THEM SO FAR MINISTERS HAVE REFUSED TO BUDGE ON THE ISSUE RECALCULATING PENSIONS ON THE OLD BASES COULD COST THE TAXPAYER BILLIONS OF POUNDS
BUT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTS SOME WOMEN COULD BE ALLOWED TO START COLLECTING THEIR PENSION SOONER IN RETURN FOR LOWER WEEKLY PAYMENTS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THAT WOULD BE COST NEUTRAL FOR THE TREASURY WOULD LEAVE THE WOMEN AFFECTED WITH LESS INCOME THAN THEY'D BEEN EXPECTING IN THEIR OLD AGE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANGLADESH CENTRAL BANKERS RESIGNED AFTER HACKERS STOLE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ITS ACCOUNT AT THE AMERICAN FEDERAL RESERVE LAST MONTH MOST OF THE MONEY IS THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LAUNDERED THROUGH CASINOS IN THE PHILIPPINES

REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THERE IT IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN IT'S FIVE YEARS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF A WAR THAT HAS CLAIMED OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION LIVES FORCED COUNTLESS MILLIONS TO FLEE THEIR HOMES AND ARE SUCKED TO WORLD POWERS INTO WHAT IS IN EFFECT A NEW WORLD WAR SQUEEZE THOSE FIVE YEARS INTO JUST FIVE MINUTES AND EVERY SECOND WOULD MARK THE LOSS OF A THOUSAND LIVES
NO SINGLE INCIDENT HAS BEEN WORSE THAN THE CHEMICAL
KILLED AND INJURED SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE REBEL HELD SUBURBS AT THE MOUTH
AND THEN THIS SUSPECTED A CLUSTER BONES
EVERY SECOND OF FAILS AND LIVES YOU CAN HEAR THE FULL STORY OF SERIES PAST FIVE YEARS TOLD OVER FIVE MINUTES LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE QUESTION AS RAISED THIS MORNING THOUGH OF COURSE IS WHETHER THE END OF THE WAR HAS BEEN BROUGHT ANY CLOSER BY LAST NIGHT'S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT BY PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT IS ORDERING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MAIN PART OF RUSSIA'S FORCES IN THE COUNTRY THIS MORNING RUSSIAN STATE TELEVISION IS SHOWING EQUIPMENT BEING LOADED ON TO TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT
WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY THE SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE DEFENCE THINK TANK BRUCIE IGOR SUTURE AGAIN GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS HEADLINE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT FORCES ARE BEING WITHDRAWN BUT NOT A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES WILL STAY MANY TROOPS AND WE BELIEVE THE BOMBING RAIDS WILL STOP YEAH PROBABLY BORN OR EATS ETOILE STOP IT COS IT IS IT'S TO USE I'M NOT HORRIBLE BUT THE ROTTEN STATE DON'T CONSIDER THAT AN AUDIBLE BOUGHT IT WE CAN I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU AND ONLY YOU CAN SO IT'S BUILT UP TO
WHEN YOU SAY UNAFFORDABLE POLITICALLY WHAT IS THE DIPLOMATIC USING PUTIN'S SINGS WITH THIS DECISION YOU PRICE IS TO BE A LONELY NOT PROSTRATE THE ARAB I'LL TRUST YOU WITH ER ALL RIGHT OF COURSE INCOME FROM ALL THESE EXPENSES BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PLANT WAS SO NOW
SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL SEE THE REWARD FOR PUTIN NOT IN DAYS NOT IN WEEKS BUT IN MONTHS IF HE CAN PERSUADE WESTERN POWERS TO LOOSEN THE SANCTIONS REGIME TO BE MORE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ON QUESTIONS LIKE UKRAINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT MAY BE A PRIZE THAT HE HAS HIS EYES ON
STOP BOMBING IN ORDER THAT YOU CAN BE ASKED TO STARTED AGAIN LATER AN EXTRAORDINARY STRATEGY WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT IT THERE IS SOME HAVE CLAIMED THE PRESIDENT PUTIN'S PATIENTS WITH HIS CLIENT WITH PRESIDENT ASAD WAS BEGINNING TO RUN OUT THAT THE TALK IN DAMASCUS OF A PERMANENT MILITARY SOLUTION AS AGAINST A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION WAS INTOLERABLE EVEN TO MOSCOW
IT'S ALL RIGHT YEP PROBABLY DAY DECIDED TO STOP YOU SO HE WOULD BE VERY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MESSAGE WHEN I BLACKED UP WHAT YOUR ADVENTURES WE HAVE
YOU'RE SITTING IN A RECEIPT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS UP FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHAT EFFECT WOULD A BRITISH VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE ON NATO OR SENIOR AMERICAN MILITARY COMMANDER HAS TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT THE ALLIANCE WOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND THAT HE'S BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THE OUTCOME WE'RE JOINED NOW BY JONATHAN BEALE OR DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN THIS IS COME FROM A CONVERSATION YOU HAD WITH THE HEAD OF THE U.S. ARMY IN EUROPE
YES THIS IS GENERAL BEN HODGES LOOKED AT TELLING GENERAL BEN HODGES WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. ARMY IN EUROPE THE SECOND MOST SENIOR U.S. MILITARY COMMAND HERE IN EUROPE IT WAS AN INTERVIEW THAT WAS BASED ON WHAT AMERICA IS DOING TO RIA SURE IT'S EUROPEAN ALLIES IT'S QUADRUPLING ITS DEFENCE SPENDING IN EUROPE NEXT YEAR IT'S BROUGHT BACK THE TANKS THE HEAVY ARMOUR BRIGADE IT'S ROTATING ITS TROOPS AND IT'S ALL ABOUT RUSSIA NOT JUST ITS INTERVENTION UKRAINE BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED
IN WHAT IN SYRIA TO YOU AND I DON'T THINK WHAT THE KREMLIN HAS AN OUNCE WILL CHANGE THAT EQUATION AT ALL NOW JO HODGES SAYS RUSSIA'S ACTIONS NEED NOT JUST THEIR RESPONSE
FROM THE U.S. BUT NATO AND ALSO IT NEEDS TO BE A UNITED FRONT IN EUROPE AND LIKE MANY AMERICANS HE SEES THE EUROPEAN UNION AS PART OF THAT FABRIC OF EUROPE NOW TELL ME YOU RECOGNISE THE VOTE ON BRITAIN'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE E.U. IS A MATTER FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE BUT HE ALSO MADE CLEAR HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THAT BOAT ON THE NATO ALLIANCE IS WHAT HE SAID
THE U.K. IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF THE ALLIANCE IT'S A LEADER IN THE ALLIANCE SO IT'S A LEADER IN EUROPE
THE MOST RELIABLE TRUSTED FRIENDS AND ALLIES WE HAVE ARE ALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
SO WHAT WE'RE GOES ON HERE IS OF STRATEGIC ENTERS TO WORSE HOME ANYTHING UNDER MAN SEE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ALLIANCE
HAS AN IMPACT ON US AND SORT OF THE Y. BEGINS TO COME UNRAVELLED THE KING HELP WHEN THE KNOCK ON EFFECT WITH THE ALLIANCE
JONATHAN YOU COULD LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID AND ARGUE THAT THIS IS A CAN FLEETING OFF TO DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT BRITAIN HAS AND AS FAR AS ITS MEMBERSHIP OF NATO IS CONCERNED THAT GOES BACK TO NINETEEN FORTY NINE
YEAH AND PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORT BRITAIN LEAVING THE EUROPEAN YOU WILL SAY HANG ON A SECOND COUNTRIES LIKE CANADA AND NORWAY ARE MEMBERS OF NATO THEY'RE NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY ARE CLOSE AMERICAN HOURS BUT I THINK THIS GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE PSYCHE OF MANY AMERICANS AND THAT IS THAT WHEN THEY THINK OF EUROPEAN ALLIES THEY ALSO THINK OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WORK WITHIN EUROPE OR A PART OF EUROPE
AND THAT INCLUDES THE EUROPEAN UNION I DON'T USE WAS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT BY GENERAL HODGES TO PREPARE LAY THE GROUND FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXPECTED INTERVENTION IN SUPPORT OF BRITAIN STAYING WITHIN THE E.E.C. BUT I THINK IT SHOWS THEY CONCERN AMONG MILITARY COMMANDERS AND HE SAID HE WAS SPEAKING AS A SIMPLE SOLDIER THAT SOMEHOW
THE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN NATO COULD BE UNDERMINED IF YOU KEEP THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORDS STARTS TO UNRAVEL AND PARTICULARLY HER BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE VOTE VOTERS A TIME OF A RESURGENT RUSSIA
YEAH AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF RUSSIA IT IS ABOUT RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION IN UKRAINE IT IS ABOUT RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION IN SYRIA AND HE USED AGAIN GENERAL HODGES THAT PHRASE THAT RUSSIA HAD WEAPONISED
THE MIGRANT CRISIS THEY ARE VERY WORRIED THE AMERICANS THAT IS WHY THEY QUADRUPLING DEFENCE SPENDING IN EUROPE NEXT YEAR BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL YOU WILL WHO WILL POINT AS YOU RIGHTLY COMMENTED SAID THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEMBERS OF NATO WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THEY HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH WITH WITH THE U.S.
JONATHAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN ONE OF THE U.K.'S BIGGEST INSURANCE HAS JUST REPORTED A BIG JUMP IN PROFITS MATTHEW PRICES HIT THANK YOU NICK YES LEGAL AND GENERAL THE LARGEST MANAGER OF PENSIONS IN THE U.K. SAID IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PROFIT ROSE NINE PER CENT TO ONE POINT EIGHT
BILLION POUNDS IT'S MANAGING EIGHT PER CENT MORE FUNDS AND IT INCREASED DIVIDEND PAYMENTS BY NINETEEN PERCENT NIGEL WILSON IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LEGAL AND GENERAL PROFITABLE YEAR A TERRIFIC YEAH YEAH TIME TO LOWER FEES WE'RE LITTLE FEES CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS TO BE THE LOW COST BEST VALUE PROVIDER IN ALL THE MARKETING WHICH WE COMPETE
ARE YOU RELIEVED THAT GEORGE OSBORNE DROPPED HIS PLANS TO REFORM THE PENSION INDUSTRY WE'RE NOT RELIEVED WE UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S DONE IT BUT IT'S JUST DEFERRED IT IT GOING TO FOCUS ON WIDER ECONOMIC ISSUES WHICH YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME AND OBVIOUSLY THE BRECHT'S DISCUSSION IT'S JUST TOO COMPLICATED A MOMENT THERE'S TOO MUCH NOISE AROUND AT THE MOMENT TO THROW SOMETHING ELSE IN
THERE'S TOO MUCH NOISE AROUND I THINK THE THE THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE BUDGET IS I THINK WE WILL SEE GREATER FOCUS ON HOW WE DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE U.K. BY INVESTING MORE THERE ARE THREE PROBLEMS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS ONE MUCH MORE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT RIGHT ACROSS THE U.K. TO GETTING ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES WE HAD TO HAVE REAL CAPITAL BEHIND THEM WITH A WORLD LEADER IN START UPS WE CAN'T MAKE THEM INTO GROWN UPS AND THREE GETTING A BIG CORPORATES TO HAVE CONFIDENCE
TO INVEST IN THE U.K. ACTUALLY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE PROGRAMME YESTERDAY OR WHY WE'RE NOT MANAGING TO LEVERAGE A START UPS INTO MASSIVE EXPORTERS AROUND THE WORLD WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING IT WAS A CULTURAL PROBLEM BUT IS THEIR LACK OF SORT OF GOVERNMENT PUSH THE TWO TWO PROBLEMS ONE IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CAPITAL INTO THESE FIRMS WE'VE CREATED A DECKED CULTURE AROUND IN THESE THESE THESE COMPANIES FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RAISE DEBT AND WE WE
THE TAX SUBSIDIES ON THAT TOO GREAT A LOT ENCOURAGED ENOUGH EQUITY INVESTMENT AND TWO WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IF YOU VISIT CHINA OR INDIA OR LARGE PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA YOU FIND THE GERMANS AND THE FRENCH EVEN ITALIANS HAVE BETTER EXPORT INFRASTRUCTURE THAN WE HELP ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE REALLY GOT TO ADDRESS IS MORE EQUITY AT HOME AND BETTER EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE ABROAD YOU THINK GOVERNMENT POLICIES ACTUALLY HOLDING BACK INVESTMENT IN IN FIRMS HUGELY
HUGE DRAG ON ECONOMIC ROARS BECAUSE WE ARE JUST FANTASTIC AT COMING UP WITH NEW IDEAS WE'VE NEVER BEEN GREAT AT MAKING THOSE NEW IDEAS INTO GREAT BUSINESS SO WHAT WHAT REFORMS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THAT AREA
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE TAX ADVANTAGES GIVEN TO PUTTING EQUITY INTO SMALL STARTER BUSINESSES WHICH ISN'T REALLY HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT AND NOT TAXING THE DIVIDENDS AND THE RETURNS FROM THOSE INVESTMENTS AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST SO WE WE REALLY ENCOURAGE RICH REVITALISATION OF THE EQUITY CULTURE THAT WE USED TO HAVE IN BRITAIN WHICH IS NOW SADLY IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT IN BRITAIN

THE AUTHOR ANITA BRUCKNER HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SHE WON A BOOKER PRIZE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FOR HER NOVEL HOTEL DU LAC ONE OF MORE THAN TWENTY BOOK SHE WROTE AFTER A DISTINGUISHED CAREER AS AN ART HISTORIAN THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT EVERY YEAR WE WASTE AROUND FOURTEEN MILLION TONNES OF FOOD IN THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN THE E.U. AVERAGE
MOST OF THE WASTE IS GENERATED IN HOUSEHOLDS BUT HOW SUPERMARKETS SELL THEIR PRODUCTS TO US MAKES A DIFFERENCE TESCO FOUND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT OF ITS BAGGED SALADS ARE NEVER EATEN NOW THE BIG SUPERMARKETS AND FOOD MANUFACTURERS ARE LAUNCHING A NEW PLAN TO REDUCE WASTE BY TWENTY PERCENT OVER THE NEXT NINE YEARS A REPORTER'S CONWAY HAS BEEN TO VISIT A DISTRIBUTION CENTRE RUN BY THE CHARITY FARESHARE WHICH TRIES TO MAKE SURE EDIBLE FOOD REACHES THOSE IN NEED
TURN THEM ON THE LEFT
BARNEY I'M DIRECTOR OF FOOD BEST JOB IN THE WORLD WHERE ARE WE WE'RE IN DEPTH IN THE LONDON REGIONAL CENTRE
JUST TAKE ME ON AT ALL HERE WE'VE GOT PALLETS A FEE
ALONG THE SHELVES WHAT ARE WE LOOKING OUT SO WE'VE GOT A WHOLE VARIETY OF GREAT QUALITY GROCERY ITEMS FROM TESCO FROM KELLOGG'S FOR NESTLE
OR ALL OF THE FOOD IN THE CHILLER HERE WILL HAVE BEEN THIS
FRIDAY SO WE'VE GOT LOTS OF FANTASTIC
SOME FRESH
VAST MAJORITY OF THE SERPENT'S EDIBLE FOOD WITHIN THAMES TESCO'S I AND CO OPS DISTRIBUTION CENTRE COMES TO
THE REAL ISSUE IS WHERE THIS SOUP ALL THIS MEAT OF THESE READY MEALS OR DIS BEING DISPOSED OF AT THE MANUFACTURING SITES THAT'S WHERE THE BULK OF THE THE EDIBLE FOOD IS BEING THROWN AWAY AT THE MOMENT NOT AT THE RETAIL STORES NOT AT THE RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CENTRE
IT'S HIGHER UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS WHERE THE WASTE IS REALLY HARD
YES ABOUT FOUR MILLION TONNES OUT OF THE FIFTEEN MILLION TONNES OF E. WASTE WITHIN THE U.K. IS AT MANUFACTURER LEVELS THERE'S THE BIG PRODUCTION SITES WHERE THE FOOD IS PACKAGES PREPARED IT'S COOKED AND IT'S PROCESSED AND THAT'S BECAUSE
THE COST OF DISPOSAL ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THE COST OF KEEPING FOOD AS FOOD AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR
THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPORTING ANAEROBIC DIGESTION WHICH IS A FANTASTIC TECHNOLOGY BUT THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING SUPPORT TO CHARITIES LIKE US JUST TALK ME THROUGH WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE
YOU'VE GOT SOME TESCO MIX FISH PIE
THAT'LL GO OUT IT'S NOT GOING OUT THIS EVENING WE'LL GO OUT TOMORROW SO THAT WILL GO TO ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY CHARITY AND COMMUNITY GROUPS ACROSS LONDON LUNCH HAD CAUSE FOR THE ELDERLY ACROSS LONDON BREAKFAST CLUBS AND ALL OF THE FRESH FRUIT AND VEG GOES TO THE BREAKFAST CLUB
CONSERVES HE'D BE DOWN THERE SOMEWHERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE
AND LOADS OF FRESH PRODUCE THAT HE'S BEEN BEEN PROVIDED TO TRY AN AWFY HE'S THROWN AWAY OR GOES INTO OUR DIGESTION
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET HOLD OF BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO THOSE SUPPLIES THEY SAY WELL IT'S CHEAPER FOR US TO THROW IT AWAY RATHER THAN HE'S TO GIVE US
GIVE YOU THAT FOOD TO PUT ON A TRUCK BUT SHE'LL TRY AND KEEP IT IN THE FOOD CHAIN IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING TO SAY EMITTER WILL I'D LOVE TO GIVE MORE CARROTS BUT WE CAN'T COS IT'S CHEAP TO SELL IT ANIMAL THING
ABOUT FOUR MILLION TONNES OF FOOD WASTE GENERATED BY THE FOOD INDUSTRY EACH YEAR WE THINK OF
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF THAT EDIBLE IN DATE FIT FOR CONSUMPTION OF FOOD THAT WE'VE BEEN RELATIVELY EASY TO BE ABLE TO RE DISTRIBUTE IF WE COULD GET HOLD OF
IF WE GET HOLD OF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT FOOD WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED
TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS A YEAR AND BE DOING THE EQUIVALENT WHAT OTHER ORGANISATIONS IN FRANCE IN PORTUGAL AND SPAIN IN ITALY IN THE U.S.
CONWAY REPORTING WELL WE'RE JOINED NOW BY ANDREW OPIE WHO'S DIRECTOR OF FOOD AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM WHOSE MEMBERS INCLUDE THE MAJOR SUPERMARKETS WHICH HAVE SIGNED UP TO THIS NEW INITIATIVE GOOD MORNING IS THIS THE BEST THAT YOUR MEMBERS COULD DO A TWENTY PERCENT CUT IN THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED OVER NINE YEAR PERIOD
IT IS QUITE A A KIND OF AMBITIOUS A PROPOSAL ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THIS IS BUILDING ON TEN YEARS' WORTH OF PREVIOUS INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SO THIS IS BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE THESE TARGETS ARE AGREED BY THE FOUR U.K. GOVERNMENTS THEY ARE THEN
INDEPENDENTLY AUDITED SO WE THINK HE'S A REALLY CHALLENGING BUT IT'S A WORTHWHILE TARGET TO BE GOING FOR WE TALKED TO THE FOOD CAMPAIGNER TRISTRAM STUART EARLIER ON THE PROGRAMME HE SAID THAT THIS WAS A CRISIS REACTION TO A PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER THINGS LIKE A PROMOTIONS THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE THAN THEY REALLY NEED OR INDEED WONKY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND NOT CONSIDERED SUITABLE FOR FOR SALE I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT WE'RE IN THE FOURTH PHASE OF THE COURT TOLD INITIATIVE THAT THEY STARTED WITH TWO THOUSAND FIVE
ABSOLUTELY SAYS IT ISN'T A PANIC MEASURE THIS IS JUST BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN AND PROGRESS WE'VE SEEN AN INTERESTINGLY IF YOU GO BACK TO THE WONKY FRUIT AND VEG WHICH WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE OF RECENTLY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE B. R. C. ACTUALLY AND ITS MEMBERS WERE ACTUALLY PIVOTAL ORLOV LOBBYING HERE AND IN EUROPE TO RELAX THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS TO ALLOW US TO SELL THOSE PRODUCTS WHICH THEN
WAS ALLOWED BY THE E.U. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BUT ONLY SOME OF YOUR MEMBERS HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT ASDA MORRISONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE HAVE TRIALLED SELLING THESE RANGERS WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS BUT OTHER SUPERMARKETS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO WELL I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IT IN THE ROUND SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS ON FARM YES THERE IS A ROUTE TO SELL THE WONKY FRUIT AND VEG WHICH WE'VE SEEN ACTUALLY MOST OF THE SUPERMARKET SELLING SO THAT'S TRUE BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S OTHER WAYS YOU CAN DO IT SO YOU COULD WORK WITH THE FARMER FOR EXAMPLE TO AGREE TO BUY THE WHOLE CROP WHICH IS WHAT
SOME RETAILERS HAVE DONE SO BY DOING THAT YOU THEN FIND A HOME FOR ALL OF THOSE CARROTS FOR EXAMPLE SO SOME MAY GO ON THE SHELVES SOME MAY BE WONKY FRUIT AND VEG THAT SOLD SOME MAY BE CUT UP INTO BATONS WHICH WE INCREASINGLY BUT I RATHER THAN JUST THE WHOLE CARROT AND SOME MAY GO INTO THEIR READY MEALS IN SUITS
YOU FIND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE COURT TOLD INITIATIVE IS ALL THE RETAILERS AND THE FARMERS AND THE MANUFACTURERS FINDING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WHICH THEY CAN SHARE WITH EACH OTHER TO BUILD AND PROGRESS THAT SHOULDN'T THEY ALL BE GOING DOWN THE ROUTE THAT THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE TAKEN YOUR POINTING AT DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT THEY ARE TAKING BUT WHY DON'T YOU AS THE BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTING FOR EXAMPLE SAY TO ALL OF YOUR MEMBERS THAT WE THINK YOU SHOULD ALL BE GOING DOWN WE WANT WE WANT
TO MEET THOSE TARGETS NOT ONLY HERE IN THE COURT ALL BUT ONE OF THE KEY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND OF THE U.N. THAT WAS AGREED AT LATE LAST YEAR WAS TO REDUCE FOOD WAY SO HOW WE GET THERE HE'S WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS WORKING WITH MANUFACTURERS AND SURPRISE AND FARMERS AND WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THOSE RETAILERS AND THOSE COSTS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY DON'T EVEN OLD DOCUMENT THEIR FOOD WASTE DO THEY HAVE THE SUPERMARKETS ONLY TESCO SEEMS TO DO THAT OUT OF NO AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOKED AT THE FIGURES AT THE B. R. C. ITSELF PUBLISHED IN OCTOBER WE PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND WE ARE PUBLISHED AGAIN SO AN ANNUAL UP DAY IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT IS CURRENTLY WASTED FROM RETAIL STORE AND A DISTRIBUTION CENTRE AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TONNES WITHIN A FIFTEEN MILLION TON WASTE THING WE REALLY NEED TO TACKLE THE BIGGEST TARGET WHICH RETAILERS CAN HELP WITH HIS WASTE IN THE HOME
ANDREW THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS RUSSIA'S SURPRISE DECISION TO WITHDRAW MOST OF ITS TROOPS FROM SYRIA IS DESCRIBED AS A PRETTY BRILLIANT TACTIC BY MILITARY ANALYST IN THE GUARDIAN
HE BELIEVED SYRIA FORCED THE WEST TO ENGAGE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN AFTER HIS ACTIONS IN UKRAINE AND NOW THEY'RE GETTING OUT WITH MINIMAL LOSSES THE PAPERS ARE MAINLY UNITED IN THEIR SCEPTICISM AT MOSCOW'S STATED MOTIVES FOR THE MOVE WITH THE DAILY MIRROR SUGGESTING THIS IS ABOUT RUSSIAN POWER BEING PROJECTED ABROAD ONLY THE TIMES IS MORE POSITIVE ARGUING THE PUTIN HAS DECIDED TO THROW A SAD OVERBOARD
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THINKS THAT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN COULD BE GIVEN A DECISIVE EDGE IN THE E.U. REFERENDUM BECAUSE A SURVEY SUGGESTS THAT BRICKS AT SUPPORTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE THE ELECTORAL STRATEGIST AND CONSERVATIVE ADVISOR SIR LYNTON CROSBY HAS TOLD THE PAPER THE FINAL OUTCOME IS IN THE BALANCE WITH VICTORY HINGING ON WHICHEVER CAMPAIGN CAN INSPIRE PEOPLE TO TURN OUT AND VOTE HE SAYS
BOTH SIDES SHOULD LOOK TO USE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SERVICES IF THEY ARE TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC OF THEIR ARGUMENT WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS UNGUARDED COMMENTS BY ANDY BURNHAM IN WHICH HE TOLD UNIVERSITY STUDENTS THE MOOD AMONGST HIS CONSTITUENTS WAS TO LEAVE THE REMOTE ARROGANT AND UNDEMOCRATIC Y. YOU ARE PICKED UP BY THE DAILY MAIL IT'S EDITORIAL COMMENDS THE SHADOW HOME SECRETARY FOR ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THE EVILS OF BRUSSELS BUT THEN ARSE SO WHY IS HE SO DESPERATE TO REMAIN IN BELIEVING THOSE WHO ELECTED HIM A MISGUIDED IT SAYS NOW WHO'S BEING REMOTE
ARROGANT AND UNDEMOCRATIC THE POOR ELECTION RESULTS EXPERIENCE BY ANGLER MERKL AT THE WEEKEND ALLOW SEVERAL PAPERS TO CONSIDER HER POSITION THE GUARDIAN ACCEPTS THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IS WEAKER THAN BEFORE AFTER HER MIGRATION POLICY WAS REBUFFED BUT STILL BELIEVES SHE'S AN ADAPTABLE LEADER
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IS MORE CRITICAL SEEING SUNDAYS RESULTS AS A STRAW IN THE WIND IF MISSUS MERKEL'S AURA OF INDOMITABLE IT HE HAS GONE FOR GOOD IT SAYS SHE HAS ONLY HERSELF TO BLAME THE INDEPENDENT IS ALARMED AT THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR IS A WORLD LEADER ARGUING AT SIGNIFICANCE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE
THE TIMES DEVOTES MUCH OF ITS EDITORIAL TO A DEFENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S HELP TO SAVE SCHEME AN OUNCE YESTERDAY CLAIMING THE INITIATIVE IS POTENTIALLY OF GREAT BENEFIT CULTURALLY AS WELL AS MATERIALLY IT ARGUES PUBLIC MONEY WOULD BE WELL SPENT ON SUBSIDISING SAVINGS AS IT COULD FREE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FROM LOT RELYING ON CREDIT AND HELP PEOPLE TO BETTER THEMSELVES SHOWING THAT ENTERPRISE AND INITIATIVE PAY IT CONCLUDES IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK THERE IS AN ECONOMIC POLICY
AND CRUFTS HAS BEEN PLUNGED INTO A ROW OVER INBREEDING ACCORDING TO THE DAILY MIRROR AFTER A SUPPOSEDLY LIMPING DOG WAS NAMED BEST IN BREED TORY A GERMAN SHEPHERD WAS PICKED BY JUDGES DESPITE HER ABNORMALLY SLOPED BACK IN OUT OF STEP GATE THE SUN SAYS TORIES OWNER INNES INSISTED THAT SHE WAS HEALTHY BUT THAT DIDN'T PREVENT HUNDREDS FROM VENTING FURY ONLINE
TO ACCUSE THE KENNEL CLUB OF CRUELTY FOR THE INDEPENDENT THE RAIL COME SIX YEARS AFTER THE ORGANISERS OF CRAFTS PROMISED TO REFORM IT'S JUDGING CRITERIA AMID A SIMILAR OUTCRY IT IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT THE THERAPEUTIC POWER OF MUSIC IS WELL DOCUMENTED BUT HOW ABOUT A ONE TO ONE PERFORMANCE FROM AN OPERA SINGER IN YOUR OWN HOME TAILOR MADE TO HELP WITH A PERSONAL PROBLEM THAT IS THE PROSPECT NOW ON OFFER FROM THE OPERA HELPS PROJECT WHICH HAS EIGHT SINGERS GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY
IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE ARTIST JOSH ARE SO FAIR WHO'S HERE IN THE STUDIO ALONGSIDE THE SOPRANO CAROLINE KENNEDY WHO IS GOING TO SING FOR US IN A MOMENT GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH MORNING JOSH OR WHAT WHAT WAS IT THAT LED YOU TO STOP THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF AN OPERA SINGER OR INVOLVED IN OPERA WELL I'VE DIRECTED OPERA ON THE STAGE BEFORE BUT THIS PROJECT REALLY CAME ABOUT ABOUT BEING IN THE AUDIENCE AND HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU BRING YOUR OWN EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE TO THE THEATRE AND
YOU'RE HOPING THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT THE MUSIC WILL HIT YOU AND THAT IT WILL AFFECT YOU IN A PERSONAL WAY AND IT BEST YOU LEAVE FEELING SOME KIND OF TRANSFORMATION BETTER ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS THAT THAT IS A ONE TO ONE EXPERIENCE BETWEEN PERFORMER AND SOMEONE IN THEIR OWN HOME IN WHAT SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCE WHAT WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO IS TO
CONTACT US WITH A PROBLEM AND REALLY THE PARADOX OF THIS IS THAT BUYING FOR FRONTING THE PROBLEM BY MAKING THE PROBLEM THE REASONS FOR PEOPLE MEETING ACTUALLY MY EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO THE MUSIC MORE ACUTELY BECAUSE THEY WILL FEEL UNIQUELY ADDRESSED BY THE ARIA THAT IS SUNG TO THEM SO THE SINGER LISTENS TO THE PROBLEM THAT THE PERSON IS PUTTING TO THEM AND THEN CHOOSES THE PIECE OF MUSIC THAT THEY THINK WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO
AS YOU SAID THEY'RE EIGHT OPERA SINGERS GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY LISTENED TO YOUR PROBLEM AND THEN THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT R. THEY KNOW FROM THEIR REPERTOIRE WOULD MATCH THE PROBLEM IN SOME WAY LET'S TURN TO CAROLINE KENNEDY WHO IS ONE OF THOSE EIGHT SINGERS AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR WHY DON'T YOU INTRODUCE THAT THE PIECE OF MUSIC CAROLINE WHAT HAVE YOU CHOSEN I'VE CHOSEN QUONDAM INVOLVED WHICH IS MUSETTA IS A. F.
NO YOU NO REALLY OH BRILLIANT
BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHAT WOULD SOMEONE SAY TO YOU IN ORDER FOR YOU TO CHOOSE IT THIS IS
AN ARIA SUNG BY A VERY STRONG LADY IN THE OPERA AND I THINK IF I SAW THE PROBLEM
AND THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE IF SOMEONE SUFFERED A HEARTBREAK AND THEY NEED A BIT OF A BOOST I THINK I WOULD SING I WOULD SING THIS ARIA
YES THERE'S A LOVELY LINK
BETWEEN THE POWER OF THE MUSIC AND WHAT WHAT'S THE LISTENER PUTS TO YOU AS THE STATE THAT THEY'RE IN THEIR LIFE YES I MEAN OPERA WE THINK OF OPERA SOMETIMES AS THIS KIND OF ELITIST THING THAT PEOPLE GO TO ON A KIND OF FRIDAY NIGHT AS AN ENTERTAINMENT BUT ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST EASY CULTURAL FORMS TO GET INTO VERY QUICKLY IT'S IMMEDIATELY EMOTIONAL CONNECTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXPLORING WITH THIS PROBE WE ALSO USUALLY SEE IT ON A VERY GRAND SCALE AND THIS IS
COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE THE INTIMACY OF SOMEONE LIKE CAROLINE BEING IN YOUR LIVING THAT'S RIGHT AND THE VOLUME OF SOUND THESE POWERFUL VOICES THAT HAVE BEEN KIND OF TRAINED FOR YEARS IN YOUR WELL WHILE YOU'RE RESTING IN BED FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN PEOPLE HAVE DISC DESCRIBED IN A KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY WAY WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF IT YOURSELF AS A PERFORMER CAROLINE
UM WELL I I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOMEONE
A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF SOLACE AND I MEAN I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THAT MUSIC HAS HELPED ME AND IT IS
CERTAINLY OPERA IS THAT THE HIGHEST THE HIGHEST FORM OF EMOTION IT'S WHEN IT'S WHEN YOU CAN'T SPEAK ANY MORE AND THE ONLY THING TO DO IS SING SO I JUST HOPE I I'D START
SOME SORT OF CATHARTIC PROCESS EVERY SOLUTION TO FAMILY ARGUMENTS GOOD YOU'VE GONE WRONG UP CATCH YOUR GOING TO PLY WITH A FAMILY PROBLEM WILL SING TO THE WHOLE FAMILY AND THEY CAN DO IT VIA THE OPERA HELPS WEBSITE OPERA HELP CENTCOM THAT'S RIGHT ALL RIGHT LOVE WHERE YOU'RE SOLICITING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY MAY HAVE AN AVALANCHE YOU REALISE THAT LET'S HOPE SO WHY DO YOU TWEET US WITH SUGGESTIONS OF PARTICULAR PIECES THAT'LL BE RATHER INTERESTING WOULDN'T PIECES THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR PARTICULAR AWKWARD SITUATION OR PARTICULAR PROBLEMS YES QUITE WE WERE GOING TO BE OVERWHELMED
JUST A SOFA AND CAROLINE KENNEDY THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU CAROLINE AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME IT IS NOW THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT AND TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS LORD SEEING DIRECTOR OF THE NETWORK OF SIKH ORGANISATIONS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING NICK YESTERDAY HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN NOW IN HER NINETIETH YEAR ATTENDED THE ANNUAL COMMONWEALTH DAY SERVICE AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY
AS HEAD OF THE COMMONWEALTH HER COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO MAKING THIS LOOSE LINKING AT FIFTY THREE COUNTRIES ARE TRIED AND TESTED FORCE FOR STABILITY AND MUTUAL CO OPERATION
THE CORPORATE THEY COMMONWEALTH SAY FORTUITOUS CREATION OF RECENT HISTORY THE NAME ITSELF IS A BIT OF A CONTRADICTION AND AN ODD WAY TO DESCRIBE A GROUPING OF COUNTRIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH HUGE DISPARITIES IN WELL
MEMBER COUNTRIES ALSO GIVE HER CONSIDERABLY IN THERE DEAR INSTA HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF WORSHIP AND YET TO MY MIND IT'S A GROUPING OF COUNTRIES THAT CARRIES HOPE AND A SENSE OF COMMON VISION NECESSARY IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD
I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS THEIR FIRST LIES IN THE CURIOUS ABILITY AT BRITISH PEOPLE TO TURN PEOPLE OF COUNTRIES THEY ONCE CONQUERED AND ENROLLED INTO FRIENDS AND EQUALS UNITED BY A SHARED HISTORY A RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING
EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE CENTRAL ROLE OF HER MAJESTY AS HEAD OF THE COMMONWEALTH HER WARMTH AND ENTHUSIASM HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE FEATURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH DAY SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS
AND HE'S ALWAYS EMINENT IN HER CHRISTMAS DAY BROADCASTS THE SERVICE IN THE ABBEY INCLUDES READING SOME PRAYERS FROM OTHER COMMONWEALTH FAITHS
THIS ONE WELCOME TO THE DIFFERENT FAITHS ECHOES THE CENTRAL CHIC TEACHING THAT WE ARE ALL MEMBERS WHO WON THE HUMAN RACE AND THAT NO ONE FAITH HAS A MONOPOLY OF TRUTH
THE SIKH HOLY BOOK THE GURU GRANDSON ITSELF CONTAINS THE WRITINGS OF SAINTS FROM OTHER FAITHS TO HIGHLIGHT SHARED CORE BELIEFS
TO ME THIS IMPROBABLE GROUPING OF MULTIPLE IDENTITIES GIVES STRENGTH AND INCLUSIVITY THE THEME OF THIS YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS TO THE COMMONWEALTH TO HELP IT MEET MANY OF THE CHALLENGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT FACING IT
IT IS ALREADY GENTLY HELPED THE SEARING LANK AND GOVERNMENT TO SET UP A TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AGAINST THE TUNNEL TIGERS AND IT COULD LEAD TO SIMILAR INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS
A COMMON AN ETHOS OF RESPECT IN UNITY OF PURPOSE CAN ACHIEVE MUCH AND END THIS THE COMMONWEALTH HAS MUCH TO OFFER
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH LORD SAYING THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT FORGIVE ME MORE SPENDING CUTS MAY BE COMING BUT WORRY NOT THE CHANCELLOR WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF HIS BUDGET TOMORROW TO INVEST IN BETTER TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE TO LINK THE GREAT CITIES OF THE NORTH THAT IS THE PRESS RELEASE HERE IS THE REALITY FOR MANY COMMUTING DAY TODAY
THE MORNING COMMUTE INTO MANCHESTER VICTORIA AND IT IS PACKED TO THE RAFTERS YOU REGULAR
YES YOU CAN HE'S NOT PEOPLE OFF IT
ROWING PEOPLE YEAH BUT WHAT THEN WHAT CAUSE SIMPLY DID YOU GET ON WELL THE CHILD TELL ME IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER YOU GET
DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN GET A SEAT OR NOT QUITE OFTEN AS WELL YOU CAN GO ON THE TRAIN
THIS MORNING SEES THE PUBLICATION OF A REPORT CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE AND VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN BETTER RAIL AND ROAD LINKS WE HAVE TO BE TALKING TO ITS AUTHOR LORD ADONIS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES BUT JUST FIRST OF ALL LET'S SPEAK TO OUR CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESCOTT THE SORT OF PEOPLE I TALK TO YOU ON THAT TRAIN THERE MAY BE TEMPTED TO SAY RICHARD WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN WE SEE IT
O.K. RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED DELIGHTED TO SAY THE LORD ADONIS WHO CHAIRS THE NEW NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION JOINS US HE'S NO CONSERVATIVE CHEERLEADER OF COURSE USED TO BE LABOUR'S TRANSPORT SECRETARY MORNING TO YOU LORD ADONIS GOOD MORNING DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE TEND TO SAY EITHER ON THE M. SIXTY TWO WERE ON THAT LINE BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LEEDS AND ELSEWHERE CUB WE'VE HEARD THERE'S MONEY FOR SCOPING AND MONEY FOR PLANS OR MONEY FOR STUDIES WHEN WE GET THE ACTUAL TRAINS
PEOPLE QUITE LIKE TO SAY THAT THE SERVICE AT THE MOMENT IS BECAUSE VERY SUBSTANDARD A SERIOUS CONGESTION IN RICHARD WAS BETWEEN JUNCTIONS TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE FOR THE M. SIXTY TWO ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS THERE SHOULD BE A FOURTH LANE PUT INTO THAT MOTORWAY IMMEDIATELY AND THE CHANCELLOR HAS ACCEPTED THAT IN THE FUNDING WILL COME FORWARD SIMILARLY ON A REALLY PACKED COMMUTER SERVICES COMING INTO MANCHESTER
ELECTRIC ASIAN OF THE BUSIEST OF THOSE ROOTS WHICH IS MANCHESTER TO LEEDS BUT IS NOW GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND THAT WILL BE COMPLETED OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS SO IT'S NOT JUST JAM TOMORROW WE'VE RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION ON THE M. SIXTY TWO ON THE RAILWAYS
LINKING THE NORTHERN CITIES BUT OF COURSE YOU ALSO NEED A LONGER TERM PLAN THING ABOUT TRANSFORMATION AND IT'S PUTTING THOSE TWO TOGETHER IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE M. SIXTY TWO AND THE RAILWAYS BUT THEN ALSO WHAT'S CALLED H.C. WHICH IS PRODUCING MUCH FOSTERING'S HALF AN HOUR BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LEEDS AND HOW MUCH THAT TAKE HOSTILITY OF SIX SIGNIFICANT NEW ROADS IN THE NORTH TO FOR EXAMPLE LINKING
MANCHESTER AND SHEFFIELD WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A TUNNEL UNDER THE PEAKS WHICH WOULD BE A HUGELY AMBITIOUS PROJECT BUT MANCHESTER AND SHEFFIELD ARE TWO OF THE WORST CONNECTED CITIES OF THEIR SIZE BY PROXIMITY IN EUROPE SO IT'S RIGHT TO THINK BOLDLY ALONGSIDE THE SHORTER MEASURES LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT H. S. THREE IS IT'S CALLED IN OTHER WORDS A GRAND PROJECT OF LINKING ALL THE GREAT NORTHERN CITIES NOT JUST MANCHESTER NEEDS BUT POTENTIALLY EVENTUALLY LIVERPOOL AND HULL THAN OTHER CITIES AS WELL HOW FAR AWAY ARE WE FROM THAT BOTH FINANCIALLY AND IN TERMS OF YEARS
THE BIG IMPROVEMENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT THE MOMENT SHOULD BE SEEN AS THE FIRST STAGE ON THE ROAD TO H. S. THREE SO THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE MANCHESTER TO LEEDS LINE WILL BRING THE JOURNEY TIME DOWN TO FORTY MINUTES WITH H. THREE THAT COULD COME DOWN TO THIRTY MINUTES SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A PHASED APPROACH IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE BIG BANG LIKE H. S. TWO
THE CREATION OF A COMPLETELY NEW LINE FOR NOTHING IT'LL BE A MIXTURE OF IMPROVING THE CURRENT LINE AND STRETCHES A NEW LINE TO DELIVER TWO OBJECTIVES BIG CUTS IN JOURNEY TIMES BETWEEN THE NORTHERN CITIES FROM LIVERPOOL IN THE WEST THROUGH TO HULL IN THE EAST AND ALSO BIG IMPROVEMENTS IN CAPACITY SO YOU CAN HAVE MUCH MORE REGULAR TRAINS AS WELL AS FASTER TRAINS ON THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH ARE ENTITLED TO BE A LITTLE BIT SCEPTICAL THOUGH THEY SEE THE QUEEN UNVEILING CROSSRAIL WON THE CHANCELLOR SAYS THAT HE WILL UNVEIL
A PROJECT THE COST DOUBLE THEIR MONEY IN LONDON CROSSRAIL TO QUITE SOON IT DWARFS THE MONEY THAT'S BEING TALKED ABOUT HIM ON NORTH OF ENGLAND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE LIVERPOOL TO MANCHESTER THAT HAS BECOME BEEN COMPLETED AND THE LINE FROM MANCHESTER TO LEEDS IS NOW GOING TO FOLLOW THAT WOULD GIVEN YOU LINES AT A COST OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION EMAILS CROSSRAIL TO THE BIGGEST SINGLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN EUROPE IS H. S. TWO AND MOST OF THAT
THAT SPENDING IS GOING ON THE MIDLANDS AND THE NORTH TO LINK THE CITIES OF BEAT MIDLANDS AND THE NORTH JUST HEATHER AND WANT ONE THEN WITH LONDON SO IT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING IN LONDON THERE'S MASSIVE INVESTMENT GOING IN THE MIDLANDS AND THE NORTH TO WHAT'S NEEDED IS TO JOIN IT UP SO THAT THE SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS LEAD TO LONGER TERM ONES AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T GOT TO WAIT ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS BEFORE THEY GET TRANSFORM SURFACES PERTAINED LIVERPOOL MANCHESTER LEEDS HA WHICH IS ESSENTIAL A FINAL THOUGHT ON YOUR NEWEST JOB A NEW COMMISSION THIS NEW NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSION
IT SOUNDS GOOD IT HAD CROSS PARTY SUPPORT BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE OVER THE PATH DON'T YOU SEE HEATHROW ON HOLD HINKLEY POINT IN DOUBT IN FOR TRUSH INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING FALLING EIGHT PERCENT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE WORDS ARE THERE BUT THE ACTUAL COMMITMENT IS NOT
IT'S IT'S TOUGH GETTING LONG TERM IT STRUCTURE DECISIONS TAKEN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I WAS THE GUY BEHIND AT THE BEGINNING OF ELECTRIC ASIAN IN THE NORTH AND H. S. TWO AND WE DID GET THOSE DECISIONS TAKEN ON HEATHROW THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT IT EXPECTS TO TAKE A DECISION LATER THIS YEAR DO YOU EXPECT I VERY MUCH HOPE IT DOES TAKE IT COS IT'S PROFOUNDLY IN THE IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST BUT AGAIN THAT FOLLOWED A PROCESS OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND
THE OPTIONS FOR EXPANDING IF I WOULDN'T BE ON THE TABLE BUT FOR THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW H. S. TWO IS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK LEGISLATION IS ALMOST PAST IN THE DIGGERS WILL BE IN THE GROUND IN TWO YEARS' TIME SO I'M AN OPTIMIST I THINK FIGHT AT THE PLANS ARE GOOD AND THE OBJECTIVES ARE CLEAR AND IN THE CASE OF THE NORTH THEY'RE VERY CLEAR THERE TO TRANSFORM
THE CONNECTIVITY OF NORTHERN CITIES AT THESE GREAT POWER HOUSE ECONOMIST WHICH ARE CLOSE TOGETHER GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT NOT IN TRANSPORT TERMS THAT WE ACTUALLY BRING THEM TOGETHER THERE IS NOT I DON'T RELATE TO THOSE AND MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND EVERYONE'S LIVES TRY WE ALL NEED TO KNOW THE WEATHER AS WELL BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR YOUR TIME LORD ADONIS AND STABBED AND AILSA STANDING BY THE STUDIO WITH THAT FORECAST STUFF THANK YOU MICHELLE AND NICK THANK YOU GOOD MORNING TO HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUED TO BRING DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE THOUGH UNLIKE YES THEY WILL SEE MORE ON THE WAY OF CLOUD PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF
OF THE U.K. FOR SOUTH WEST ENGLAND NORTHWEST ENGLAND AND WALES HAS BEEN A CHILLY START ONE OR TWO MIST OR FOG PATCHES AROUND BUT GENERALLY THESE WERE CLEAR TO BE HAVE A LOVELY DAY WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE AROUND A BIT OF CLOUD BUILDING IN CENTRAL WALES MOST PLACES STAYING DRY AND TEMPERATURES REACHING THE LOW TEEN CELSIUS FOR MOST AREAS FOR SOUTH EAST ENGLAND THE MIDLANDS EASTERN ENGLAND AND NORTH EAST ENGLAND HERE'S WHERE WE'VE GOT THE CHANGED TODAY WE'VE GOT A CHILLY START SOME SUNSHINE AROUND THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTH EAST ENGLAND
BUT LOW CLOUD AND MIST IS ALREADY ROLLING IN OFF THE NORTH SEA ALONG EASTERN COASTAL COUNTIES AND CONTINUE TO MOVE INLAND SPRING A CLOUDIER DAY THAN YESTERDAY SO THE CLOUD WILL BE THICK ENOUGH THE ODD PATCH OF DRIZZLE AROUND ESPECIALLY EAST OF THE PENNINES A FEW CLOUD BREAKS MAY APPEAR THOUGH ACROSS SOME SOUTHEASTERN CORNERS PARTICULARLY SOUTH EAST THING AWAY WE SHOULD SEE SUNNY SPELLS ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY JUST NUDGING TEMPERATURES ELEVEN OR TWELVE CELSIUS HOWEVER A CHILLY EASTERLY BREEZE TAKEN THE EDGE OFF THOSE VALUES PARTICULARLY ALONG THE EAST COAST
FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND POTENTIALLY HERE SEEN THE BEST OF THE WEATHER AGAIN PARTICULARLY EASTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND SHOULD SAY AND WESTERN SCOTLAND WHERE WE COULD MAKE TEMPERATURES OF SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CELSIUS IN THE WESTERN HIGHLANDS HOWEVER FOR EASTERN SCOTLAND IT WILL BE A CHILLY DAY THAT LOW CLOUD ROLLING IN AND SOME OF IT GOING THROUGH THE CENTRAL BELT AS WELL AS WE COULD SEE TEMPERATURES AROUND SIX CELSIUS IN EDINBURGH AROUND NINE FOR GLASGOW

THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID IT WILL PASS A LAW COMMITTING THE U.K. TO REDUCE ITS CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS TO ZERO TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S NOT YET EXPLAINED HOW THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVED OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HERB IN REPORTS
THE CLIMATE CHANGE ACT COMMITS TO U.K. TO CUTTING CARBON EMISSIONS BY EIGHTY PERCENT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY THE GOVERNMENT IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP PACE WITH THE TIMETABLE OF CARBON CUTS BUT IN THE COMMONS THE ENERGY MINISTER ANDREA LEAD SOME SAID THE BAR MUST BE RAISED EVEN HIGHER TO KEEP TO THE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE AGREEMENT REACHED IN PARIS BEFORE CHRISTMAS

REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THE TIME IS TEN PAST EIGHT THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF RUSSIAN MILITARY INTERVENTION IN SYRIA FIRST THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN SEPTEMBER THAT RUSSIAN PLANES WOULD BEGIN STRIKING TARGETS OF SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND THEN LAST NIGHT STATEMENT
NOW THAT RUSSIA HAD RADICALLY TURNED THE TIDE OF WAR AND HELPED CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR PEACE TALKS SAID PRESIDENT PUTIN HE WAS ORDERING THE PULL OUT OF THE MAIN PART OF HIS FORCES FROM SYRIA IT MAY BE HARD TO ASSESS WHEN OR IF THAT'S BEEN COMPLETED GIVEN THAT RUSSIAN TROOP NUMBERS IN SYRIA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF A MYSTERY A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTS LEAST SET SETTERS IN DAMASCUS AT THE MOMENT WHERE SHE'S WATCHING HOW THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS CHANGING
WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME YESTERDAY ALL OF A SUDDEN PRESIDENT PUTIN SAID WOULD START TODAY THAT THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WOULD START PULLING OUT TODAY AND THERE ARE SOME REPORTS COMING IN NOW OF ACTIVITY AROUND THEIR BASES IN PARTICULAR AT THE AIR BASE THAT WAS JUST SET UP LAST YEAR AS PART OF THEIR EXTENDED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN SERIOUS SO WE WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT WILL HAPPEN QUITE QUICKLY OF COURSE IT'S NEVER BEEN CLEAR
HOW MANY RUSSIAN TROOPS WERE ACTUALLY SENT TO SERIOUS SILVER PROBABLY UNLIKELY TO KNOW HOW MANY WILL BE BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO EMPHASISE THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL RUSSIA'S MILITARY PRESENCE WHICH IS HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR RUSSIA GOES BEYOND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA WILL STAY HERE INCLUDING WHAT IS AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY NAVAL BASE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN ACT UP TRUCE IN THAT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REINFORCED AS UNDER THE OVERALL COVER A FIGHTING AGAINST THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT THE AIR STRIKES AGAINST CEASE THIS HASN'T BEEN CLEAR IN THE ANNOUNCEMENTS THEY TALKED ABOUT THEIR MILITARY OBJECTIVES BEING LARGELY ACHIEVED THEY STILL ALSO TALKED ABOUT COUNTERTERRORISM THEY ALSO SAID SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE IN OPERATION TO HER TO MONITORING THE CEASEFIRE THE TRUCE THAT IS STILL NOW IN ITS THIRD WEEK EMBEDDED WOULD BE ACTING AGAINST ANY VIOLATION SO THE ANNOUNCEMENT
WELL IT MADE CLEAR THAT SOMETHING WAS CHANGING IT WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD STILL BE ACTIVITY BY RUSSIAN JETS AND OF COURSE THE EVENTS WEAPONRY THAT RUSSIA STENT IS HERE FOR THE SYRIAN OUR ARMIES AND THEY'RE FORCED TO USE
AND WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE HEARING THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT SAY ABOUT THEIR EXPECTATION OF WHAT THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO DO AND WHAT IT MEANS
BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS LEFT SCRAMBLING YESTERDAY THE WHITE HOUSE THE CAME OFF QUITE FLAT FOOTED THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHEN THE NEWS CAME OUT THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THE CLASSIC PUTIN BUT VERY QUICKLY AFTER WHERE IT'S THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS AT PAINS TO SAY THIS WAS COORDINATED WITH US WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT MAYBE THE CASE BECAUSE THERE WERE CONSTANT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN MOSCOW AND DAMASCUS IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL RELATIONSHIP
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHO SUGGESTED IT WHO'S PUSHING IT AND THE ASSUMPTION IS GIVEN WHAT THE KIND OF STATEMENTS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE RUSSIANS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN UNHAPPY WITH PARTICULARLY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PRESIDENT ASAD SECOND IN INTERVIEW THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY
TAKE BACK MILITARILY ALL THE TERRITORY HE'D BEEN LAST IN WE'VE GOT A VERY RARE PUBLIC REBUKE FROM THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS SAYING THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT GOING TO BE HERE FOR AT THE FOREIGN EVERLASTING WAR THAT THERE WAS THEY HAD TO MOVE TO NEGOTIATIONS
WAS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT THIS CAME AFTER A VERY HARD LINE FROM THE SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER HERE IN DAMASCUS SAYING THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT DISCUSS PRESIDENT NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WHICH ARE PART OF THE PROCESS THAT AFTER ALL RUSSIA PLAYED SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE IN FORGING BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS ALL THROUGH RUSSIA'S ENHANCED MILITARY INTERVENTION HERE IT IS SAID ONE THING AND DONE ANOTHER IT HAS BIG OBJECTIVES HERE AND RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE TO WATCH BUT NOT JUDGE NOT BY WORDS BUT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND
LEAST HE'S SET IN DAMASCUS FIELD A LIQUEUR ON OF HIS EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE JOURNAL RUSSIA IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS AND CHAIRMAN OF THE PRESIDIO OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICY AND I ASKED HIM HOW HE THINKS PRESIDENT PUTIN'S WORDS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED
I THINK WE SHOULD INTERPRETED AS SHE SAID THAT THE MAIN PART OF THE RUSSIAN OPERATION IN SYRIA IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO START TO WITHDRAW FOR SUS
BECAUSE THE GENERAL SITUATION AND ON THE FIELD ON THE GROUND CHANGED QUITE PROFOUNDLY WE'VE CAUSED THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT THE REGIME OF SYRIA
HAS BEEN STRENGTH DON'T QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY BASICALLY SAVED BY THE RUSSIAN INTERVENTION A BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK IT'S A SIGNAL TO THE MAST GOES THAT RUSSIA IS NOT GOING TO DO THE WHOLE JOB FOR THEM BUT THE MAJOR RATIONALE THAT WAS PUT FORWARD AT THE TIME THAT THE BOMBING CAMPAIGN BEGAN WAS THAT THESE WERE AIR STRIKES AGAINST SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND IT REMAINS THERE HOLDING TERRITORY IN SYRIA
YES BUT IT HAS BEEN THE REDUCED FROM BOTH SIDES ARE BOTH IN IRAQ
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE U.S. NEVER JOINED FORCES OFFICIALLY NEVER ANGLED ENGAGED IN THE COALITION BUT AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE FROM THE RUSSIAN POINT DO YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO COUNTER WORK TERRORISTS ON THE GROUND WE NEED THAT ENABLE STAYED IN SYRIA BUT YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT THAT THE TARGET OF TACKLING
OH YES IN SYRIA HAS ONLY PARTIALLY BIN ACHIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT IN TOTAL SUCCESS FOR WHAT PRESIDENT PUTIN WANTED TO DO ON THAT FRONT I WONDERED ABOUT THE EQUATION IS HOW REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE CAN BE DESTROYED OR WERE SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED BY AIR REFER ORDERLY AND THEN WHAT TO DO NEXT THERE'S ANOTHER CHAPTER OR SO IT SHOULD BE
NEW STRUT THEIR I THINK WHICH CANON WOLFE FOR BOTH RUSSIANS AMERICANS AND OTHERS AND BY THE WAY THE FACT THAT ANNOUNCED THE WITHDRAWAL OF MAJOR FORCE US THAT'S NOT MEAN THAT ALL FORCES WE LEAVE SERIA WHAT PROPORTION WOULD BE PULLED OUT THEN HEAT HE SAID THE MAIN PART OF THE FORCES WILL BE PULLED OUT HOW MANY DO YOU THINK THAT IS
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IT HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED WE WILL SEE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS MEANS THEN FOR THE PEACE TALKS INJURED EVEN FOR THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT IS IS UNDER WAY UP SHOULD WE READ INTO THIS OR CHANGE A SOFTENING OF PRESIDENT PUTIN SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT
FROM AS FAR AS THEY WERE BUT THEY CLAIMED THAT IT WASN'T THE GALL OF RUSSIA JEWS SUPPORT ARSENAL PERSONALLY AND NO ONE BELIEVED IT BUT RUSSIA IS NOT TOTALLY BARN GLASS ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD NO LONGER BE AS CONCERNED BY THE DEPARTURE OF PRESIDENT ASAD
FROM FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN SYRIA I THINK IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT THROUGH OUR SHOW WILL BE LESS CONCERNED TO BOATS I SUPPOSE SLIP OF COURSE ER ASSAD WILL BE GIVEN
FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY AS SOME PERSONAL GUARANTEES BECAUSE VERSION O.K. END OF THE FOURTH RIB PETITION OF LIBYA'S AREA OR REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AFTER WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN FORCES FROM SOVIET FORCES FROM I'M GOING TO STUN
IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND RUSSIA OF COURSE WE'LL KEY AREA BALD TO TO DO TO THE EXTENT THAT HE WILL BE THERE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S DEAD KEEN TO KEEP HUMAN POWER OR FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SHE OTHER LOOKING FOR LISTENING TO ALL OF THAT IS JEREMY BOWEN A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR LET'S START JEREMY WITH THAT THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE THIS LEAVES PRESIDENT ASAD
I THINK THE THING ABOUT THE RUSSIANS AND PRESIDENT ASAD IS THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO HAVE PRESIDENT ASAD I THINK PUTIN WANTS IS TO HAVE HIS MAN THERE SO
AS LONG AS HE CAN HAVE A BIG SAY IN WHO COMES NEXT THEN HE PROBABLY ISN'T ALL THAT BOTHERED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S SAD OR SOMEBODY ELSE THE THING IS THE RUSSIANS HAVE A LOT OF BIG CONNECTIONS WITH THE ARMY ESPECIALLY IN SYRIA IF AS I DO SOMETIMES WHEN I'M OVER THERE I GO INTO THE OFFICES OF SYRIAN GENERALS IN DAMASCUS
IN ALL OF THEM YOU SEE LITTLE COMMEMORATIVE PRESENTATION CRESTS AND THINGS COMING FROM RUSSIAN UNITS AND EVEN BOOKS IN RUSSIAN ABOUT MILITARY TACTICS ON THEIR DESKS SO THEY HAVE
THE RUSSIANS THEY EXACTLY WHO'S IN THE ARMY WHO'S CELIA THEY MAY WELL ALREADY HAVE SORTED OUT THE KIND OF A SHORTLIST PERHAPS OF CANDIDATES FROM THE ARMY WHO THEY WOULDN'T MIND AND THAT BIG SAY HOW MUCH HOW MUCH DOES IT DEPEND ON ON RETAINING A SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY CONTINGENT IN SYRIA BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO ASSESS HOW THIS PULL OUT OF THE MAIN PART OF PRESIDENT PUTIN'S FORCES IS PROGRESSING I THINK YOU GET
INFLUENCE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IF YOU PUT SOMETHING IN THERE FOR THE WEST IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS BEING SAYING I MUST GO BUT DIDN'T REALLY DO A GREAT DEAL TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THOSE STATEMENTS WEREN'T CREDIBLE THE RUSSIANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY HELP THE REGIME
FIRST DIPLOMATICALLY AND OF COURSE OVER FIFTY SIXTY YEARS MILLER TERRIBLY IN TERMS OF SUPPLIES BUT SINCE THE WAR STARTED THEY GAVE THEM DIPLOMATIC COVER AT THE U.N. IN NEW YORK AND THEN IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS VERY IMPORTANT MILITARY INTERVENTION AND I THINK THE THING ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME YESTERDAY WAS THAT ACTUALLY IT SHOWS THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE KEPT THEIR OPTIONS OPEN THEY HAVEN'T SAID HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TAKING OUT THEY'VE SAID THAT THEIR FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE AND IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL I WOULD IMAGINE IF THEY
FOR THEM IF THEY CAME OUT WITH INSANE A MONTH OR TWO AND SAID LOOK
AT THE REQUEST OF OUR ALLY PRESIDENT WE HAVE BEEF THINGS UP OR THEY MAY BE THINKS UP WITHOUT SAYING SO IF THEY WANTED TO THE POINT IS I THINK THAT
THAT PUTIN IS IS HE'S PLAYING ONCE AGAIN A VERY CLEVER STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST BUT HOW MUCH IN THESE SIX MONTHS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT RUSSIAN INTERVENTION HOW MUCH HAS IT CHANGED THE SITUATION HERE WE STILL HAVE TODAY POCKETS OF THE COUNTRY CONTROLLED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS INCLUDING AYE US AND THE REGIME WERE MORE THAN POCKETS BIG SWATHES OF THE COUNTRY I ALWAYS FELT THAT THE PREDICTIONS OF ASAD'S
THESE WERE OVERDONE HAVING SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH THE MILITARY I THOUGHT THAT ALL THE REPORTS ABOUT HOW WEAK THEY WERE
WEREN'T WHOLLY CREDIBLE BUT THEY STILL HAD VERY COHESIVE ALBEIT ELITE UNITS ARE NOT VAST NUMBERS BUT THE THE MILITARY THERE AFTER FIVE YEARS OF FIGHTING
VERY TIRED AND SUDDENLY THEY HAD THIS BIG FRIEND COMING IN AND DOING THINGS FOR THEM AND IT ENABLED THEM TO I THINK REALLY TO CHANGE TO STABILISE AND EVEN CHANGE THE MILITARY BALANCE IN THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT MOVE AND I THINK PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE GROUPS WHO THE THE WEST HAD SORT OF VAGUELY BEEN STRINGING ALONG WITH PROMISES ABOUT WHAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT DO IN THE FUTURE IT WAS AN EVEN BIGGER BLOW
THAN ALL THE OTHERS THEY'VE SUFFERED IN THE PAST VERY BRIEFLY DID JEREMY RUSSIA'S STANDING ENHANCED IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS DONE THIS ON ITS OWN TERMS AT THE TIMES OF IT'S CHOOSING THE INTERVENTION AND NOW THE WITHDRAWAL IF THAT IS INDEED WHAT THIS IS RUSSIA'S ADVANTAGE IN THE SYRIAN CRISIS HAS BEEN THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
THE WEST HASN'T REALLY BEEN CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT WANTS AND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THERE SO I THINK THAT PUTIN THE KREMLIN RUSSIA HE'S CLEVER FOREIGN POLICY TEAM HAVE BEEN SETTING THE PACE OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS JEREMY BOWEN THANK YOU
TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT PRISONER BALMER IS IN REFLECTIVE MOOD AS HIS RECENT COMMENTS ON THE MESS THAT IS LIBYA REVEALED AS THE UNITED STATES FOCUSES ON THE CHOICE OF HIS SUCCESSOR
HE KNOWS HIS PRESIDENCY IS RAPIDLY DRAWING TO A CLOSE AN IDEAL TIME TO APPEAR BEHIND THE CURTAINS OF THE OVAL OFFICE TO STEP INSIDE OBAMA'S WHITE HOUSE THAT IS THE TITLE OF A NEW AND FASCINATING DOCUMENTARY SERIES WHICH BEGINS ON B. B. C. TWO TONIGHT
IN IT WE HEAR NOT JUST FROM THE PRESIDENT BUT MANY OF HIS CLOSEST ADVISORS ABOUT THE KEY MOMENTS WHICH SHAPED HIS TIME IN OFFICE HERE HE IS DESCRIBING THE MOMENT SOON AFTER HE WAS ELECTED WHEN HE REALISED JUST HOW GRAVE THE ECONOMIC SITUATION WHAT
DURING THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN I WAS HAVING FAIRLY CONSTANT PHONE CALLS WITH FINANCIAL ADVISERS SO BY THE TIME
I WAS PRESIDENT WHACKED I HAD A GOOD SENSE THAT WE WERE IN THERE MISTER B. MAJOR CRISIS WHAT I WASN'T AWARE WAS HOW RAP
THE BOTTOM WOULD FOLLOW AND THE BACK
WHAT HAD STARTED ON WALL STREET WAS NOW SPREADING THROUGH MAINSTREAM AND THIS IS CHRISTIE ROMA THEN OBAMA'S ECONOMIC ADVISER REFLECTING ON THE DAY JUST ONE MONTH INTO OFFICE THAT SHE HAD TO BREAK THE NEWS OF TERRIBLE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES TO HIM
THEY HAD DAY THEY WERE JUST HORRIBLE SO WE LEARNED THAT WE'D ONLY LOST FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS BUT THE NUMBER IS FOUR
OCTOBER AND SEPTEMBER HAD BEEN REVISED TO HELP THEY WERE LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS AND LIKE WE HAVE THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION FEWER PEOPLE EMPLOYED THAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD YESTERDAY
SOMEONE SAID THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ON THE PHONE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS AND I WAS ALMOST INCOHERENT IT WAS LIKE MY PERSONAL LIKE THAT I'M SO SORRY THIS IS SO HORRIBLE AND IT WAS WHEN HE KIND OF LIGHTEN THE MOOD WILL HE SAID KRISTIAN IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT IT WAS WITH ONE POWERS YEAH
YET THE TELLING WORD IN THE DOCUMENTARY MADE BY THE CELEBRATED AND MULTIPLE AWARD WINNING DOCUMENTARY MAKER NORMA PERCY WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF TONIGHT'S PROGRAMME AND THE WHOLE SERIES AND JOINS US IN THE STUDIO NOW
THERE IS THIS FASCINATION IN THE DOCUMENTARY NORMA WHERE YOU SEE THE EUPHORIA OF OBAMA'S ELECTION AND THEN WITHIN WEEKS THE HORROR OF THE COLDEST OF COLD SHOWERS AS HE GETS THAT ECONOMIC NEWS IT WAS A DREADFUL START FOR IT WASN'T IT YEAH IT WAS AND I MEAN BUT WE DO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE THE VIEWERS SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE INSIDE THE ROOM AT THESE MOMENTS AT THESE AT THESE KEY MOMENTS WHEN DECISIONS ARE MADE AND POLITICIANS ARE PUT UNDER PRESSURE
WE KNEW WHEN WE STARTED THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT'S ONE HIT OF ARMOUR WHEN HE CAME IN BUT IT'S A BIT OF A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR SOMEBODY MAKING AN EXCITING POLITICAL DOCUMENTARY HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HER A STIMULUS IN AN ECONOMIC CRISIS BUT ALSO THE POWER IS BECAUSE YOU INTERVIEW SO MANY OF THE KEY PLAYERS ARE NEW INTERCUT THEM AS THEY RECALL PARTICULAR INCIDENCE YOU GET SOME OF THE DRAMAS SOME OF WHAT YOU NORMALLY HAVE TO WATCH THE WEST WING IN ORDER TO GET
WE WAS ALWAYS AND I WANT IT WE COULD MAKE IT MAKE IT ESCAPE LIKE THE WEST WING AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE WELL WE'RE COMING UP TO I MEAN TRULY CHRISTIE ROMA DESCRIBES TO THE PRESIDENT WHAT SHE SAYS MISTER PRESIDENT THIS IS YOUR HOLY SHIT MOMENT THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE YOU SAY OH MY GOD THAT BOY IS IT WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
BECAUSE OF COURSE HE WHAT THEY WERE TELLING YOU IS THAT THEY THOUGHT THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM MIGHT GO DOWN AND MOST OF THE A THIRD OF ALL MORTGAGES MIGHT HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE STATE AND WHAT DOES HE DO NOW IF SHE HAD EXPLAINED IT IN ECONOMICS I MEAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUNK BUT SHE DID SHE WAS A FANTASTIC FIND CHRISTIE
I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE YOUR FAVOURED ANTE AND SHE JUST DESCRIBES THINGS LIKE LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU AND YOU THINK HE DESERVES CREDIT FOR HIS HANDLING OF THAT TERRIBLE CRUTCH
YES HE CERTAINLY DOES I MEAN THAT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT HIS TIME IN OFFICE IF YOU HADN'T GOT THAT RICE AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD FOLLOW IT BUT IT WAS THE TERRIBLE SHARKEY HADN'T HAD COME IN PROMISING CHANGE
COME IN PROMISING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS CLIMBERS GUANTANAMO AND AND HE HAD TO PUT EVERYTHING ON HOLD AND GOES STRAIGHT FOR GETTING A GETTING THE ECONOMY SORTED WELL YOU MENTIONED WENT ANYWAY LET'S JUST HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM IN A SENSE OF HIS OWN MAKING BECAUSE HE PROMISED TO CLOSE IT AND THEN FOUND IT EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO DO SO
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD THOUGHT THAT SOME PRISONERS COULD BE RELEASED AND MOST OF THE REST SENT TO TRIAL BUT SOON HE HAD TO TELL THE PRESIDENT IT WAS WRONG THE VAST MAJORITY OF GUANTANAMO PRISONERS COULD NOT BE PROSECUTED
I'LL BE FRANK WE DID NOT HAVE A DESIRE TO RELY ON TESTIMONY OR INFORMATION GLEANED FROM THE PRISONER THAT WAS AS A RESULT OF TORTURE
THAT SEEM TO US TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHO WE WERE AS A NATION AND CERTAINLY INCONSISTENT AND WITH THE WAY IN WHICH WE WANT TO BE SIM ILLUSTRATION TO BE VIEWED AROUND THE WORLD THAT WAS THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ERICH HOLDER THERE TALKING FOR NORMA PERCY'S DOCUMENTARY I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TIME TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BUT I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE HUMAN PRICE YOU'VE PAID TO MAKE THIS DOCUMENTARY YOU'VE COME IN WITH A BIT OF A BLACK GUY AND YOU'VE GOT A BANDAGE ON YOUR WRIST THIS WAS ALL DONE ON THE DAY YOU WERE MEANT TO INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT
YEAH WELL IT WAS MY ONE AMBITION LEFT I'VE SYMBOLS TO PRESIDENTS THAT NEVER ACTUALLY SITTING IN THIRD THERE WERE HEALTH AND FOR THREE YEARS I MEAN WE WE GOT ACCESS TO THE EMBALMER TEAM WHEN WE MOVED UP THERE FEEDING CHAIN FROM THE OF MINOR OFFICIALS TO PRESS OFFICERS TO THE CABINET MINISTERS AND THEY'D ALL BE SENT TO SEE HOW YOU GET ON AND FINALLY AS IT GOT TO BE SIX YEARS AND THEY STARTED THINKING ABOUT HIS LEGACY THEY TOOK OUR REQUEST HIM TO BE AT THE PRESENT
WITHOUT THE PRESIDENT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIS BUT WE NEED WE NEEDED THE PRESIDENT AND JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE WHITE HOUSE THAT TRIED TO TAKE YOU OUT IT WAS AS A BIKE IN LONDON IT'S CERTAINLY WELLS AND I WAS GETTING INTO A TAXI TO GO AND FILM THE PRESIDENT WHEN AROUND THE CORNER CAME A BIKE AND HIT ME AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS IN AN AMBULANCE GOING TO A.

THE WEATHER IT'S GOING TO BE CLOUDY TODAY WITH FOG IN THE EAST SUNNIER IN THE WEST YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH MICHELLE A SANE AND NICK ROBINSON AT TWENTY SIX MINUTES PART TO NINE NEIL SLEET IS HERE WITH A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS MOSCOW SAYS RUSSIAN WAR PLANES HAVE BEGUN FLYING OUT OF SYRIA HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT PUTIN ANNOUNCED A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL MY PUTIN SAID LAST NIGHT THAT RUSSIA HAD LARGELY COMPLETED ITS OBJECTIVES IN THE COUNTRY
THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE IS TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT'S BACKING TO TWO MAJOR RAIL PROJECTS IN HIS BUDGET TOMORROW THE UPGRADING OF THE LINE BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND LEEDS AND CROSSRAIL TO IN LONDON THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMMISSIONERS STRONGLY URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO SPEED UP THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORT LINKS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
THE PARLIAMENT IN MYANMAR HAS ELECTED THE COUNTRY'S FIRST PRESIDENT IN FIFTY YEARS NOT TO COME FROM A MILITARY BACKGROUND TINCH ALWAYS A CLOSE ALLY OF UNSOUND SOO CHEE WHO HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY THE ARMY FROM LEADING THE GOVERNMENT
THE AUTHOR ANITA BRUCKNER HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SHE DIDN'T BEGIN WRITING FICTION UNTIL HER FIFTIES AND THEN PRODUCED MORE THAN TWENTY BOOKS INCLUDING THE BOOKER PRIZE WINNING NOVEL HOTEL DU LAC THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED NEIL IS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE THERE WILL BRITAIN'S FIRST NEW NUCLEAR POWER STATION IN TWENTY YEARS EVER BE BUILT THE GOVERNMENT SAYS YES THE FRENCH COMPANY E.D.F. SAYS YES DESPITE WARNINGS OF MASSIVE COST OVERRUNS BUT IS IT THE WRONG QUESTION TO ASK
IS THE WRONG TYPE OF NUCLEAR REACTOR BEING PLANNED FOR HINKLEY POINT SHOULD A TRIED AND TESTED AND LESS COSTLY MODEL REPLACE WHAT IS CURRENTLY PLANNED WHAT WOMAN WHO THINKS SO IS IAN FELLS HE'S EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF ENERGY CONVERSION AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY MORNING TO YOU PROFESSOR FELLS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLAN
IF THERE ARE THREE THREE PROBLEMS ONE IS THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM THE COSTS HAVE ESCALATED IN THIS CASE FROM UNBELIEVABLY EIGHT
BILLION POUNDS TO TWENTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION POUNDS AND WHEN I QUESTIONED ONE OF THEIR DIRECTORS ABOUT THIS IS YOU KNOW WELL IT'S BECAUSE IT'S FIRST OF A KIND IN THERE OH IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE IT WAS DUE TO START UP ON TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THAT'S BEEN PUT BACK TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT THE EARLIEST EVENT THERE'S A POLITICAL PROBLEM WHERE WILLY AT THE MOMENT THE TWO PRIME MINISTERS
OUR OWN PRIME MINISTER A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC TO GET IT BUILT THE TOP OF IT IS THAT WE DO NEED MORE POWER GENERATION BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF IT AS A RESULT OF SITTING ON OUR HANDS AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER IS THAT IT DOESN'T PUT CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR FUTURE STRATEGY BUT NOT THIS SOURCE OF NUCLEAR REACTOR IS YOUR VIEW IS IT NOT IN OTHER WORDS THE SO CALLED HE P. A EUROPEAN PRESSURE
WELL MY OWN FEELING WELL THERE ARE OTHER OTHER POSSIBILITIES A.P. PETE WANTS FROM REACTOR WHICH IS THE WESTINGHOUSE REACTOR AND THREE OF THOSE ARE BEING BUILT UP MORE SIDE UP IN THE NORTH OF THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND THEN AT THE PROSPECT OF A JAPANESE REACT TO BEING BUILT DOWN
IN IN IN WALES OR POSSIBLE ISSUE TO THOSE BEING THERE ARE OTHER REACTORS ON ON SHOW BUT DO SWITCH IT SPEED THOUGH BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A LONG PLAN LONG TALKED ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN THEORY HAS BEEN FOUND COULD THEY SUDDENLY TURN ON A SIXPENCE OMEN LET'S BUILD A DIFFERENT IDEA
WELL ONE WHICH I'M ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PLUG IN THAT PARTICULARLY WANT IT WHEN I DHACHAIGH I SUPPOSE I DO WANT TO PUSH THE IDEA AND THAT IS WHAT IS CALLED THE S. A MARBLE SMALL MODULAR REACTOR IT WAS SHOT REALLY SMALL IT IT'S ROUND ABOUT
THREE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS THAT'S ABOUT A QUARTER THE SIZE OF A CURRENT TO FLEAS AND THE GREAT ADVANTAGE IS THAT FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN BUILD THEM IN THE BELT FOURTEEN MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YOU CATCH A BUILT IN A FACTORY AND THEN TAKE THEM ALONG TO THE SIDES
ACTUALLY BURIED UNDERGROUND AS WELL WHICH MAKES THE WHOLE THING RATHER SAFER AND SO IF YOU HAVE ANY INVESTOR O. K. THEN YOU START GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK IT WOULD BE A MORE QUICKLY SO THERE'D BE A LOT TO BE SAID FOR MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION PROFESSOR INSULTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
THE TIME IS TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE NOW WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE START OF THE CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL FROM ROB JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO ALL THE KEY JOCKEYS AND TRAINERS THERE AS HE WAS TELLING HIS LEAD BY WILLIE MULLINS IS REGARDED AS THE TRAINER MOST LIKELY TO COME AWAY WITH THE BIGGEST NUMBER OF WINNERS AFTER REGISTERING A RECORD EIGHT AND CHELTENHAM LAST YEAR ROB WENT TO IRELAND TO SEE HIM IN ACTION
IT'S WET IT'S WINDY AND IT'S WILLIE MULLINS YARD IN COUNTY CARLOW ISLAND THE HOME OF A RACING AGAINST FATHER PALLY TRAIN DAWN RUN TO VICTORY IN BOTH THE CHAMPION HURDLE AND GOLD CUP IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES A CHELTENHAM EXCLUSIVE WILLIE'S SIX TIMES IRELAND'S AMATEUR CHAMPION JOCKEY BUT NOW TEN TIME LEADING TRAINER STARTED BACK
SEVEN YEARS LATER CAME HIS FIRST CHELTENHAM WINNER WHEN WE DID HAVE A PORTER IN A TOURIST ATTRACTION IN NINETY FIVE I THINK YOU WERE THEN DONNA THAT'S AS MUCH AS ANY I WOULD HOPE FOR AT THE TIME NEVER DREAMT
IT WOULD BE THE WAY IT IS NOW WE APPRECIATED WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST FOR EVER WE THINK THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES IN THE HISTORY OF THIS YARD WE'RE ENJOYING IT EVERYONE WORKS HARD AS YOU CAN SEE THIS MORNING IN THE WET AND THE WIND AND THE RAIN ALL OUR STAFF ARE THERE THEY'RE ALL JUST DRESS FOR THE WEATHER IT'S WHAT WE DO AND IT'S TOUGH ON STAR
IT CERTAINLY IS TAKE GAYLE CARLISLE FOR EXAMPLE HEAD GIRL WHO SHARES THE STABLES WITH THE HORSES AND THE BIRDS SHE'S CHARGED WITH ALL THE JUST THINKS THIS YEAR OF GETTING SOME SIXTY HORSES ACROSS THE IRISH SEA TO CHELTENHAM FOR THE RIGHT RACE AT THE RIGHT
JUST CHAOS TO VIVIEN'S ORGANISED CARES COS WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE KNOW THE ROUTINE WE USUALLY GO THROUGH TO GET THERE
IT'S STILL CHAOS THE DECISIONS ARE ON ME AT ALL LAST MINUTE LIKE US HAVE WHICH ONES RUN AWAY A LOT BUT WE CAN'T REALLY GUESS TOO FAR AHEAD
WE'RE ALSO OF A HEAP IN THE CORNER
AND IN THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN TALES OF THE UNEXPECTED OF THE HORSE FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAVEL TO CHELTENHAM ONLY TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF ITS STABLES WITHOUT EVEN BREAKING A SWEAT BUT NEVER BEEN ENTERED FOR A RACE LAST YEAR WITH HIS SON PATRICK AN AMATEUR RIDER WAS DELIVERED WITH AN AGREEABLE SURPRISE SO WE GOT A PHONE CALL OFF MY FRIENDS SING YOU RAIDING WE'VE GOT TOMORROW
SET UP KNOW WILLIE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING TO ME AS I PRESUMED HE WAS PULLING MY LEG COURSE IT WAS I DON'T NEED TO THAT'S WHAT IS ALMOST WHAT'S GOING ON REALLY BUT I MEAN I WASN'T COMPLAINING YOU KNOW WE WERE OUT IN FRONT OF THE WINNER
HE WAS EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE WE DIDN'T WIN THEM FORTUNATELY BUT WE FINISHED FINISHED AND IT WAS I THINK THAT'S TRUE REEF ONE RIDER IN PARTICULAR THOSE PRECISELY WHAT IS GOING TO GET THE PICK OF THE HORSES WILL BE WALSH HAS BEEN CHELTENHAM'S CHAMPION JOCKEY NO LESS THAN NINE TIMES HAS A SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT WITH HOLLAND SEEING THEM
TRACE THEM AND AN A. SIDE A RAID THEM THINGS ALL HIS TRAINING WITH HIS EYES HE SEES THINGS IT'S CAN EXPLAIN
IT WOULD EXACT UPS AND FOR THE NEXT HORSE HE KNOWS THEM ALL HAVE YOU I THINK YOUR TRAINS WHEN HE HASN'T GOT ON IT'S TO GREAT TALENT IN A TRAINER ISN'T UNBELIEVABLE IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC FARMING TO FOLLOW ANYBODY COULD TRAIN THEM SO IT'S NOT SCIENCE
O.K. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO HEAD BOY HEAD TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF WILLIE MULLINS CHELTENHAM ENTRIES IS ALSO PART OF YOUR SUCCESS STORY TO SEE THEM ALL GOING THROUGH THEIR PACES ON THE GALLOPS UNDER THE WIND AND RAIN IS LIKE WATCHING A CAVALRY CHARGE AS IT SWEEPS ALL BEFORE IT
SO IT READS NEGATIVE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT MULLINS CURRENT DOMINATION POLITELY HE SWERVES THE CRITICISM SPORT SICKLY CERTAIN TEAMS RACE TO THE TOP OF THIS STAY THERE AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF SPORT DO NOT ANTICIPATING THE MOMENT WHEN YOU GET THE DOWNWARD TURN THEN I I SHOULD IMAGINE YOU ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU KNOW HOW HIGH CAN YOU GO AND NOW WE ARE AT THE TOP
WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A FESTIVAL WINNERS LAST SEASON CAN WE DO IT THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S NEARLY AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK OR LOTS OF THINGS WEREN'T RIGHT FOR US LAST YEAR THE BOTH PREVIOUS YEAR DIDN'T A LOT OF THEM ARE FAVOURS JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMINATION NOT BECAUSE OF THE HORSE'S ABILITY IT'S JUST PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO BACK OUR TEAM WON
THAT REPORT FROM ROB BONNET AT THE TIME IS EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO NINE THE HEAD OF THE U.S. ARMY IN EUROPE HAS TOLD THE B.B.C. THAT BRITAIN LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON NATO GENERAL BEN HODGES SAID IF THE E.U. BEGINS TO BE UNRAVELLED THEY CAN'T HELP BUT BE A KNOCK ON EFFECT FOR THE ALLIANCE WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY COLONEL RICHARD CAMP A FORMER COMMANDER OF BRITISH FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT GENERAL HODGES SAID WELL I THINK CLEARLY THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
AND OUR OWN LEADERS DON'T DON'T AGREE WITH JOHN A LODGE AS THAT HE WAS LIKELY TO UNRAVEL BECAUSE IF THEY DID I THINK THAT TWO THINGS WOULD HAPPEN FIRST OF ALL WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT MUCH GREATER EFFORT BY E.U. LEADERS TO TO HELP US TO RENEGOTIATE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN THE WAY THAT THIS COUNTRY WANTS AT THE PRIME MINISTER TRIED TO ACHIEVE
WHICH CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T AND WE HAD SOME NAIL BITING NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT DOWN TO THE LAST MINUTE RESULTING IN A VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE AND THE SECOND ISSUE I THINK IS THAT THE IF THE IF THE
UNRAVELS IF THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE E.U. CAN'T HOLD THEMSELVES TOGETHER COHERENTLY WITHOUT THE U.K. THAN YOU DO HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WHOLE FUTURE OF THE WHETHER WE'RE IN OR OUT BUT COULD YOU IMAGINE THE SITUATION WHERE BRITAIN BOATS TO LEAVE WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS WORKING LESS AND LESS WITH OTHER E.U. COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE AND GERMANY WHICH ARE PART OF NATO AND THAT THAT SEPARATION THAT EDGING FURTHER APART DOES HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THE ALLIANCE DEPENDS ON
IT MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT I DON'T THINK THE EFFECT WOULD BE EITHER CATASTROPHIC OR SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY COULD IN FACT BE BENEFICIAL BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF NATO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MEMBER OF NATO THE U.S. IS OF COURSE NOT A MEMBER OF THE GLORIOUS TURKEY NOR IS CANADA OTHER MEMBERS OF NATO OR NOT YET THE RELATIONSHIPS STILL WORK ARGUABLY PERHAPS MUCH ARGUABLY BRITAIN HAS IS THE STRONGEST MEMBER OF THE OF NATO NEXT TO THE U.S. AND WHETHER WE'RE ACTUALLY INVOLVED AND INTRICATE
FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP OR OR THE EVER CLOSER UNION HE WANTS TO ACHIEVE IN POLITICAL TERMS I DON'T THINK THAT AFFECTS OUR POSITION WITHIN NATO AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THAT ONE COUNTRY AND OF THE EUROPEAN BLOCK IS HE'S ON A SEPARATE BASES IS GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE NATO LIKE THAT WITH THE POINTY EARS MADE THOUGH PARTICULARLY IF IT'S ABOUT THE MOMENT THAT THIS IS HAPPENING A MOMENT THAT HE SAID THAT EUROPE NEEDS TO STAND UP TO RUSSIA
DO YOU TAKE THAT POINT THAT IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WOULD HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT THAT PERHAPS THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR IT I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE TIME FOR IT BECAUSE I THINK ANY OTHER TIME IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY TOO LATE OR IMPOSSIBLE WE'RE LOOKING NOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT NOTO AT THAT THROW THE Y. YOU FAST TRACKING TURKEY INTO E.U. MEMBERSHIP WHICH PUTS THE E.U. BORDERS THAT ON THE ON THE ON THE FRONTIERS OF SYRIA IRAQ
AND ISLAMIC STATE AND DO WE WANT THAT DO WE WANT DO WE WANT OUR BORDERS TO BE EXTENDED OUT THERE DO WE WANT ANOTHER SEVENTY MILLION PEOPLE WITH THE THE FREE ABILITY TO RANGE AROUND EUROPE AT WELL I THINK I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE MOMENT WHEN WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MOVING OUT OF THAT YOU AND I THINK THAT WERE IT WITHOUT A DOUBT WOULD BENEFIT OUR DEFENCES AND OUR SECURITY KENNEL RICHARD CAMP THANK YOU
IT IS QUARTER TO NINE MORE THAN FIFTY FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING TO PUT OUT A SERIOUS FIRE AT THE HISTORIC WYTHENSHAWE HALL NEAR MANCHESTER THE FIRE STARTED IN THE ROOF OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY TIMBER FRAMED HALL IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WE CAN TALK TO WARRANT BRIXTON IS THE AREA MANAGER OF GREATER MANCHESTER FIRE AND RESCUE IS IT STILL ABLAZE MY BRIXTON

MAKING SURE THEY STILL REMAINS UP RIGHT I MEAN INTIMATE FRAMED BUILDINGS OF THIS AGE NORMALLY GIVE US VERY SERIOUS BUYERS AND THE BUILDING WAS COMPLETE LOSS BUT THE SECRETARIES WORKED REALLY WELL SINCE THREE THEATRE THIS MORNING
WELL CONGRATULATIONS TO THEM AND THANK YOU TO YOU WARREN PICKED HIM FOR JOINING US IT'S A IT'S A GLORIOUS BUILDING LET'S HOPE IT IS PRESERVED IT'S THIRTEEN MINUTES TO NINE IMAGINING AND UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE TOLL OF FIVE YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE WATCHING FROM THE OUTSIDE TODAY'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN THE FIRST PROTESTS AGAINST PRESIDENT ASAD BEGAN THEIR BRUTAL RESPONSE LED TO THE CIVIL WAR THAT KILLED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE AND FORCED ELEVEN MILLION OUT OF THEIR HOMES
TO MARK THE ANNIVERSARY WE'VE CREATED A SOUNDSCAPE IN WHICH EVERY BEAT OF THE CLOCK REPRESENTS THE DEATH OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH MINUTE MARKED BY A TOLLING BELL REPRESENTS FIFTY THOUSAND DEATHS
IT STARTED HERE GRAFFITI SPRAYED ON THE SCHOOL WALL CALLED ON PRESIDENT ASAD TO GO TEENAGE BOYS ARRESTED ALLEGEDLY TORTURE
IN THIS UNDER VERIFIED VIDEO THE PEOPLE FOLLOWING THE CARS APPEAR TO BE CHANTING AGAINST BRUSH A ALICE
THE MILITARY AND SECURITY FORCES HAVE LIZ STARTED TO END THE PARENT SHOOT TO KILL POLICY
WE WILL JUDGE ASIDES SIDES SINCERITY AND SERIOUSNESS BY WHAT HE DOES NOT BY WHAT HE SAYS IF HE IS READY TO BRING THIS DARK CHAPTER SYRIA'S HISTORY TO A CLOSE HE CAN PROVE IT BY A MEDIA
I FELT THAT THESE EX CONSTITUTED CLAIMS AGAINST HUMANITY AND I ARE THEY COMMENDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE OTHER FURTHER ON TO THE INTERNATIONAL
I WON'T MOST DISTURBING FINDINGS I CAROL
OFF LARGE TRAINING CAMPS WE HAVE CHILDREN MOSTLY BOYS FROM THE AGE OF FOURTEEN I RECRUITED AND TRAINED IT TO FIGHT IN THE RANKS
A IS A ALONG
SO WELL DOCUMENTED CASES OF INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN BEING TORTURED AND EXECUTED AND TYRE
AREAS THEY CONTROL THE UN FINDS EXECUTION IN PUBLIC SPACES HAVE BECOME A COMMON SPECTACLE SOME CASES PASSED
WON'T PAY RANSOMS TO TERRORISTS WHO KIDNAP OUR CITIZENS I KNOW THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY ARE THE VICTIMS
HIS FAMILY HAD ONLY JUST APPEAL TO HIS KIDNAPPERS TO MAKE CONTACT WHEN THEY GAVE THEIR CHILLING RESPONSE THE VIDEO SIMILAR TO THOSE POSTED AFTER THE MURDERS OF TWO AMERICAN JOURNALISTS THOUGH TAILORED THIS TIME TO HAVE THIS BRITISH MAN HAS TO PAY THE PRICE FOR YOUR PROMISE CAMERON TO PUSH MORE GOOD
TAKE THE FIGHTER ISIS WHEREVER WE CAN
BRITISH PILOTS ARE DOING THAT IN THE SKIES ABOVE
IF WE WERE TO DO THAT IN THE SKIES ABOVE SYRIA WE NEED A VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS UNLESS WE WOULD BE
THAT WE WOULD WIN THAT
WHAT LOOKS LIKE A RUSSIAN MIG FIGHTER JET IN THE SKIES OVER NORTHERN SYRIA AND THEN THIS SUSPECTED A CLUSTER BOMB
IN THREE HORRIFIC YEARS IN SYRIA NO SINGLE INCIDENT HAS BEEN WORSE THAN THE CHEMICAL ATTACK THE KILLED AND INJURED SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE REBEL HELD SUBURBS OF THE MAN
STILL
ON THE GREEK ISLAND OF LES BOSS TODAY THE B. B. C. COUNTED AT LEAST FIFTY BOATS LIKE THESE LANDING ON THIS COAST IN JUST FOUR
MOST OF THE CONFLICT
THIS IS THE GRIM RESULT OF A SIEGE IT'S GONE ON FOR SIX MONTHS WITH NO FOOD AT ALL REACHING THE TOWN OF MY DIET SINCE OCTOBER
HE SAID IT'S BEEN A WHOLE WEEK SINCE HE HAD ANYTHING AT ALL TO EAT WHAT WOULD HE LIKE MOST HE WAS ASKED YES SOMETHING SWEET PIECE
YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE BURNISHING WHERE CAN WE GO ALL SYRIA'S BEING KILLED
WE ASKED THE WORLD TO HELP FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND THE FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY IS MARKED ON THE B.B.C. WEBSITE WITH ANALYSIS INCLUDING LIFE AND DEATH IN SYRIA WHICH LOOKS AT WHAT EVERYDAY LIFE IS LIKE FOR THE EIGHTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO STILL LIVE THERE IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK
WHAT CONNECTS MARGARET THATCHER ANGELA MERKEL AND THE LEADER OF THE NEWLY SUCCESSFUL ALTERNATIVE FOR DEUTSCHLAND FRANK PETR THEIR SUCCESSFUL WOMEN POLITICIANS OF COURSE SO FAR SO UNSURPRISING BUT THEY ARE OR THEY WERE ALSO CHEMISTS SO COULD THERE BE A SPECIAL ALCHEMY
IN THAT COMBINATION OF THE FEMALE GENDER A SCIENTIFIC ANALYTICAL MIND HERE TO TELL US IS LIZ MACINNES WHO IS HERSELF A SCIENTIST HE'S A POLITICIAN LABOUR M.P. AND FORMER BY A SCIENTIST AND BOLLI ARNOLD IS PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AT AN EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY WHAT DO YOU THINK LIZ DOES THIS GIVE YOU A SPECIAL CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH POLITICAL PROBLEMS THAT PERHAPS A BLOKE TENDED TO GO ON GUT REACTIONS COS HE'S DUMPY BEARD OXFORD DOESN'T IT
YEAH IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WELL I THINK WE ARE ALL GUILTY OF GOING ON GOOD OFF GOT A GOT REACTIONS OCCASIONALLY BUT I DO THINK THE SCIENTIFIC TRAINING IT DOES TEACH YOU TO DO THINGS THAT ARE USEFUL IN POLITICS LIKE EVALUATING EVIDENCE WAYNE UPDATE AND THINKING ABOUT THINGS LOGICALLY AND ALSO SOMETIMES QUESTION IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE GIVEN AND I THINK IT DOES
TEACH YOU THAT SORT OF ANALYTICAL SCALE BUT YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE USEFUL AS A POLITICIAN POLLY ARNOLD ARE THOSE SKILLS THAT YOU SEE IN THOSE LEADERS SPEAK IS A PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY RATHER THAN A POLITICIAN YOURSELF
YES I DO I I SEE HER DETERMINATION TO USE LOGIC AND PROBLEM SOLVING MUCH MORE IN POLITICS THESE DAYS BUT I ALSO RECOGNISE THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE CHOOSE A DEGREE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ENJOY AND ONE THAT THEY KNOW WON'T CLOSE DOORS AND CHEMISTRY REALLY IS THAT SORT OF DEGREE BUT IT IS INTERESTING ISN'T IT THAT THESE THREE WOMEN ALL STUDIED SCIENCE ALL STUDIED CHEMISTRY AS WELL AND PERHAPS GIVES THEM AN APPROACH TO PROBLEMS THAT THEIR MALE COMPETITORS ALMOST ALWAYS HOOFER STUDIED THE ARTS HAVE NOT GOT POLLY
I'D LIKE TO THINK SO YES ALTHOUGH IT IT'S SOMETHING YOU NOTICE IS THIS IF THEY STICK IT OUT TO P.H.D. LEVEL THEN VERY OFTEN FEMALE SCIENTISTS WILL BE GOING INTO WORK IN A PARTICULARLY MALE DOMINATED ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL ALSO GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL SKILLS IF NOT BEING NOT BEING SUBJECT TO
BEING PUSHED AROUND IN THE THINKING TO YOU YOU'VE GOT ELECTED RELATIVELY RECENTLY IN A BY ELECTION TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HAVE YOU SOMETIMES BEEN SURPRISED BY THE APPROACH THAT COLLEAGUES TAKE TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS IN OTHER WORDS THAT THEY DO TEND TO GO ON GUT INSTINCT AND SOUGHT A POLITICAL POSITION AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH THE PAPERWORK AND DOING THE STUDDING IN DAY ASK IN THE DETAIL QUESTIONS AND I THINK THESE DAYS I THINK POLITICIANS ARE MUCH MORE READY TO TO ACTUALLY
DO THE BACKGROUND WORK THAT'S NECESSARY OCCASIONALLY YOU DO FIND YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO REACT STRAIGHTAWAY AND THERE ISN'T TIME TO DO THAT SORT OF SCIENTIFIC SORT OF FORENSIC RESEARCH THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BUT I DO THINK THAT POLITICIANS THESE DAYS ARE MORE THOROUGH I THINK THERE ARE FAR MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON OZ AND PEEP WITH SOCIAL MEDIA THESE DAYS PEOPLE ARE VERY READY TO PICK UP ON EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE THAT WE MAKE
HE HITS THE HELL HOT THERE THERE'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER POLITICS REALLY IS ABOUT FACTS OR IN THE END WHETHER IT'S ABOUT JUDGEMENTS POLLY I'LL BECAUSE TAKE THE EUROPE DEBATE FOR EXAMPLE A JOURNALISTS HERO COMES TO TALK TELL US THE FACTS WAS REALLY TRUE AND OFTEN THESE ARE PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE THERE IS NO SINGLE FACTUAL ANSWER AND IN THE END YOU HAVE TO WEIGH UP THE EVIDENCE OF THE PAST AND BAKER ARE YOU KNOW USE YOUR HUNCH
ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE ABSOLUTELY BUT SCIENTISTS ARE ALSO VERY GOOD AT WORKING IN TEAMS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS AS WELL IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO TEACH THEM TONY HE'S A SUPER POWERS FOR GOOD WE TEACH THEM ABOUT TAKING EVIDENCE FROM A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT POLITICIANS HAVE EXTREMELY ARE SUPPORTED BY ALL OF THEIR RESEARCHERS AND WONDERFUL CIVIL SERVANTS EVERYWHERE
ANALYSING ALL THE STUFF QUICKLY AND THEN PROBLEM SOLVING ON YOUR FEET IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINITELY A SCIENTIFIC SKILL PERHAPS COS I'M DOING THE INTERVIEW NOT MICHELLE YOU HAVE GENEROUSLY NOT POINTED OUT THAT WOMEN TEND TO BE CALMER MORE ANALYTICAL THAN MEN IN THESE SITUATIONS
OH MUM ALL RIGHT I LIKE SOME THINGS BUT I JUST DO YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT MARGARET THATCHER THAT ALTHOUGH SHE DID A DEGREE IN CHEMISTRY SHE DIDN'T WORK FOR VERY LONG IN A SCIENTIFIC FIELD SHE ACTUALLY DID
WENT OFF TO DO A LAW DEGREE AND ACTUALLY WENT IN TO THE MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTES ARE VENTURING POLITICS SO SHE HAD SHE HAD A GO AT BOTH REALLY I'M SURE THE CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND HELPS HER BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF LAWYERS IN THIS PLACE AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR SKILLS AND BEEN ABLE TO THINK ON YOUR FEET BUT I DO THINK A SCIENTIST WE ARE GETTING BETTER AT COMMUNICATING
I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED IN THIS AND IN THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT FOR SCIENTISTS TO BE ABLE TO GET COMPLICATED IDEAS ACROSS PICKET IN TERMS THAT MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AND I THINK THAT SORT OF TRAINING HELPS AS WELL LIZ MCINNES LABOUR M.P. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND POLLY ON A PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY THANK YOU
HURRAH FOR LAW DEGREES AND THE TIME IS COMING UP TO ONE MINUTE TO NINE AND THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT FROM US OUR EDITORS TODAY WITH JOEL MOORS AND ANDREW BRYCE AND AFTER THE NEWS JIM ARE CLEARLY WILL BE SPEAKING TO HELEN SHARMAN IN THEIR LIFE SCIENTIFIC BUT WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH SOME OPERA AFTER OUR DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT A NEW INITIATIVE TO BRING OPERA INTO HOMES SO GOOD MORNING FROM ARSON AND OVER TO THE SOPRANO CAROLINE KENNEDY WHO'S GOING TO SING PART OF PUCCINI'S JANICE KIKI
