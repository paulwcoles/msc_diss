IF HE GETS THE CHANGES HE WANTS
AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IS AT THE END OF THE LINE FOR BOG OFF THE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE DEALS IN SUPERMARKETS AND WE'LL ALSO HEAR WHAT LAURENCE OLIVIER'S RICHARD THE THIRD MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED LIKE IF YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO FOOTBALL COMMENTARY
IF I DID TOP END IT'S A GOAL YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE FROM A TEAM THAT'S GONNA WIN THE LEAGUE
THAT HAS TO BE WORTH WAITING FOR ALSO ON THE PROGRAMME DON'T BE DON'T BE ORDINARY DON'T BE DIFFERENT DON'T STAND OUT DON'T DROP OUT NO I DON'T REALLY
IT WAS THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER WHY DID IT RUN OUT OF READERS WILL BE TALKING TO LISA MARK WHILE THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY BUT FIRST WITH A SUMMARY OF ALL OF TODAY'S NEWS A NEWSREADER CURRY
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT HAS DISMISSED A DECLARATION BY THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BUSH I WAS SAD THAT HE INTENDS TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL HE'S RECAPTURED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN AN INTERVIEW RECORDED BEFORE A DEAL TO END HOSTILITIES WAS ANNOUNCED AT TALKS IN MUNICH PRESIDENT AS SAID IT MADE NO SENSE FOR HIM TO AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY
HE INSISTED THAT IF THE ARMY SIR PRINCIP AGAINST ALEPPO WERE SUCCESSFUL IT WOULD CUT THE REBEL SUPPLY ROUTE FROM TURKEY AND PUT AN END TO THE WAR WITHIN A YEAR BUT A STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN SAID HE WAS DELUDED A SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FRANK GARDNER REPORTS FROM MUNICH
AFTER THE INITIAL CAUTIOUS ENTHUSIASM THE GREETED THE ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY HAVE A POSSIBLE PAWS IN THE SYRIAN CONFLICT TODAY REALITY HAS SET IN WITHIN HOURS AND INTERVIEW EMERGED GIVEN BY SYRIA'S PRESIDENT ASSAD IN WHICH HE'D VOWED TO CARRY ON FIGHTING AND EVENTUALLY RECAPTURE ALL OF HIS COUNTRY FROM THE REBELS
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CALLED HIM DELUDED BUT RUSSIA EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE U.S. WOULD KNOW CO OPERATE WITH IT TO ATTACK WHAT ARE CALLED TERRORISTS FOR RUSSIA IN SYRIA THAT INCLUDES THE MORE MODERATE MAINSTREAM REBELS WHO ARE CURRENTLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES
REBEL COMMANDERS SAY THEY'D TO INTEND TO CARRY ON FIGHTING UNTIL PRESIDENT ASSAD LEAVES POWER AND SAUDI ARABIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS TOLD THE MINUTE SECURITY CONFERENCE THERE CAN BE NO CHANCE OF DEFEATING ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA WELL PRESTON REMAINS
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TOLD GERMAN BUSINESS LEADERS THAT HE CAN WIN A REFERENDUM TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION NIPPY GETS THE CHANGES HE'S SEEKING BUT SPEAKING AT A DINNER IN HAMBURG LAST NIGHT ATTENDED BY CHANCELLOR MERKEL HE SAID THAT IF HE DIDN'T GET A DEAL HE RULED NOTHING OUT IT WAS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF VISITS HIS MAJOR EUROPEAN CITIES TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR HIS PROPOSALS BEFORE IMPORTANT MEETING AT THE E.U. LEADERS NEXT WEEK OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IAN WATSON LISTENED TO THE SPEECH
THE TONE OF DAVID CAMERON'S LAST SET PIECE SPEECH BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S CRUCIAL SUMMIT WAS POSITIVE HE SAID HE WAS CONFIDENT THE REFERENDUM WOULD BE ONE IF YOU'VE GOT A NEW DEAL FROM IZZY YOU PARTNERS AND TO GIVE HIS GERMAN AUDIENCE INCLUDING ITS MOST PROMINENT MEMBER UNCLE A MIRACLE THIS PLEDGE IF BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE THESE CHANGES THEN I WILL UNEQUIVOCALLY RECOMMEND THAT BRITAIN'S STAYS IN A REFORMED EUROPEAN UNION ON THESE NEW
HE QUICKLY FOLLOWED THIS WITH HIS USUAL DISCLAIMER THAT IF HE DIDN'T RECEIVE THE TERMS SORT THEN HE RULED NOTHING OUT BUT MANY OF HIS OWN M.P.S BELIEVE IT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE FOR HIM TO DENOUNCE EITHER HIS OWN DEAL OR HIS NEGOTIATING SKILLS AND THEN CAMPING TO LEAVE
AND THE REMAINS OF HIS SPEECH WOULDN'T HAVE DISOBEYED THEM HAVE THAT IMPRESSION HE GAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW HE'D ARGUE FOR CONTINUED THE E.U. MEMBERSHIP STRESSING THE NEED FOR EUROPEAN NATIONS TO STAND TOGETHER IN THE FACE OF REGIMES WHICH IN HIS WORDS RIP UP THE RULE BOOK AND THREATEN OUR SAFETY PERHAPS RECOGNISING THAT SOME OF HIS OWN M.P.S ARE DENOUNCED AS DRAUGHT DEALERS THREAD THERE
HE PROMISED TO CONTINUE TO ARGUE FOR A FURTHER CHANGES ALONGSIDE ALLY SUCH AS GERMANY TO MAKE EUROPE MORE COMPETITIVE AND OUTWARD LOOKING BUT SCEPTICS IN HIS OWN PARTY I'D LIKE THAT TO SEASON THIS AS PROOF OF THE PAUCITY OF HIS ORIGINAL DEMANDS
FRANCIS SAND PATRIARCH REAL REALLY THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH HAD HELPED TALKS IN CUBA THE POWER SUCH MEETING SINCE A BITTER SPLIT IN THE WESTERN AND EASTERN BRANCHES OF CHRISTIANITY NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS AGO AFTER THEIR DISCUSSIONS THERE TWO MEN SIGNED A JOINT DECLARATION URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO STOP WHAT THEY CALLED THE EXTERMINATION OF CHRISTIANS IN THE MIDDLE EAST A RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT CAROLINE WYATT REPORTS ON A. HISTORIC MEETING WITNESSED BY THE WORLD'S MEDIA
IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN HE THOUGHT MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN AND HE'D STARTED WITH A KISS AND A FRATERNAL EMBRACE FINALLY POPE FRANCIS SAID TO PATRIARCH CAREER
THE GREAT SCHISM IN CHRISTIANITY DATING BACK TO TEN FIFTY FOUR BETWEEN THE CHURCH IN THE EAST AND THE WEST EMERGED LARGELY OVER ISSUES OF PAPAL AUTHORITY AND DOCTRINE
BUT AFTER CENTURIES OF CHILL THE THOUGHT BETWEEN TODAY'S ROMAN CATHOLIC AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX LEADERS CAME ABOUT THEY SAY IN RESPONSE TO THE DESTRUCTION OF ANCIENT CHRISTIAN SITES IN SYRIA AND IRAQ AND THE VIOLENCE UNLEASHED ON CHRISTIANS OF EVERY KIND BY THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP THE WRETCHES
COULD HAVE BEEN BUT THAT'S GOOD WE SEE IF SO SCENTED THAT PATRIARCH A REAL DESCRIBED THERE TWO HOURS OF TALKS AS OPEN AND BROTHERLY HELIUM POPE FRANCIS APPEALED TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR URGENT ACTION TO STOP CHRISTIAN'S BEEN KILLED AND CHURCHES PROFANE
HOWEVER BROADER AIMS MAY LIE BEHIND THIS MEETING THE VATICAN THEY HOPE TO HELP ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA AND THE CHURCH IN UKRAINE OR PATRIARCH GRILL THEY WISH TO BOOST HIS STANDING WITHIN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH
THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER SAYS BRITAIN MUST KEEP PITS TRIDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT IF HE WANTS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE WORLD IT OUGHT TO BE B. C. THE TRIDENT ALLOW THE U.K. TO PUNCH ABOVE ITS WEIGHT LABOUR IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING ITS POSITION ON TRIDENT AHEAD OF A COMMON SPOOTS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE LATER THIS YEAR HE'S A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BEALE
WHEN ASKED WHETHER BRITAIN SHOULD BE INVESTING AROUND THIRTY BILLION POUNDS IN A FLEET OF NEW SUBMARINES TO CARRY THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR MISSILES THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY REPLIED UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT IT SHOULD
CARTER SAID KEEPING THE DETERRENT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. TO NATO AND FOR BRITAIN'S HIGH STANDING IN THE WORLD HE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE U.K.'S MILITARY POWER TO MATCH THAT STANDING THOSE WORDS WILL BE AMMUNITION FOR LABOUR M.P.S WHO FEAR THAT JEREMY CORBIN IS A BAD TO OVERTURN THE PARTY'S SUPPORT FOR TRIDENT
LABOUR'S DEFENCE SPOKESMAN EMILY THORNBERRY RECENTLY SUGGESTED THAT UNDERWATER DRONES COULD SOON BE ABLE TO DETECT SUBMARINES MAKING THE DETERRENT VULNERABLE TO ATTACK BUT MISTER CARTER SAID THEIR ABILITY TO EVADE DETECTION WAS WELL PROVEN AND THE U.S. ITSELF WAS INVESTING HEAVILY IN IT SUBMARINE FLEET
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS ARE BEING DEPLOYED ACROSS BRAZIL TO HELP WARM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THE MOSQUITO BORNE A SEEKER VIRUS THE HEALTH MINISTRY HAS SAID THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BABIES ARE NOW KNOWN TO HAVE MICROCEPHALY A MALFORMATION OF THE BRAIN THAT'S LINKED TO THE BARRAS A CORRESPONDENT WERE A DAVIS IT'S AS A MILITARY BARRACKS IN REAR TO GIN EERIE
FORTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS ARE BEING GIVEN A PEP TALK BY A SENIOR GENERAL THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT IS THAT WAR AGAIN BUT THIS TIME
AGAINST THE SMALLEST ENEMY OF ALL THE ADDIS IS IT DEEP MOSQUITO
ONE OF THESE SOLDIERS AIRMEN AND SAILORS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS
WILL BE HANDING OUT LEAFLETS AND GOING ROUND TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES TELLING THEM HOW TO SPOT THE MOSQUITO AND HOW TO TRY AND ERADICATE SUCH A DANGEROUS INSECT
THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT KEN SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS HANDING OUT LEAFLETS REALLY ACHIEVE THE PROBLEM SURELY LIES WITH THE LACK OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE
CHRONIC LEVELS OF POLLUTION AND A FAILURE TO INVEST IN CLEAN WATER SUPPLIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND INDEED IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA
SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW HAT FOR SMART SICK COULD BE USED TO MONITOR EARTHQUAKES KNOWN AS MY SHAKE YEP HARNESSES THE SOPHISTICATED MOTION SENSORS INSIDE FOR ENDS TO DETECT EARTH TREMORS EVEN AT THAT HE'D BUY IT IN A POCKET OR BAG THE DEVELOPERS ARE HOPING TO RECRUIT THOUSANDS THEY'RE A NUISANCE TO BUILD UP A DATA GATHERING NETWORK THERE COULD ALSO ISSUED WARNINGS ABOUT IMPENDING EARTHQUAKES
THANK YOU COREY IT'S NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN HE'S DELUDED THAT WAS THE SHORT AND SIMPLE RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BUSH A L. ASAD'S DECLARATION THAT HE INTENDS TO TAKE BACK THE WHOLE OF HIS COUNTRY BY FORCE THIS AFTER A DEAL HAD BEEN HAMMERED OUT AIMED AT BRINGING AN END TO HOSTILITIES IN JUST A WEEK'S TIME IN ORDER TO ALLOW
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MUCH NEEDED AID OUR SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FRANK GARDNER IS ON THE LINE FRANK MORNING THERE'S A HUGE CONTRAST ISN'T THERE BETWEEN THE RHETORIC WE'RE NOW HEARING AND THE OPTIMISM WHICH BRIEFLY EMERGE FROM THOSE PEACE TALKS
IS THAT REALLY DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG THAT OPTIMISM I HAVE TO SAY EVEN JOHN KERRY WHO WAS THE SORT OF CO AUTHOR OF THIS OAPS USED IDEALS PERHAPS TOO BIG A WORD FOR IT BUT THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED
EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING EVEN HE SAID I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN TO GET THIS PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING NOT A FULL SCALE CRUISE STUDLEY NOT OF PEACE DEAL BUT WHATEVER OPTIMISM THERE WAS THIS TIME YESTERDAY MUNICH I THINK IS EVAPORATED MARROW BECAUSE SINCE THEN OF COURSE WE'VE HAD
THIS INTERVIEW THAT TOMORROW TO OPPRESS THEM AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GIVEN JUST BEFORE THE DEAL WAS AMOUNT BUT IT WAS AIRED YESTERDAY IN WHICH HE SAID AS YOU MENTIONED HE'S GOING TO RETAKE THE WHOLE OF THIS COUNTRY HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES AND THE REBELS HAVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CARRY ON FIGHTING AS LONG AS HE'S IN
AND I WATCHED ADDLED YOUR BRA YESTERDAY WAS TIDY FOREIGN MINISTER GIVE HER A VERY ROBUST STATEMENT TO THIS CONFERENCE SAYING THERE'S NO CHANCE OF DEFEATING SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ISIS DIES
IN SYRIA OR LONG AS PRESIDENT I THOUGHT THAT SO WE'RE ALL RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WORK WITH THE LOG JAM DOES IT MEAN THAT PAWS ARE ENTIRELY DEAD FRANK OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT UNDERNEATH ALL THIS RHETORIC THEY COULD STILL BE AREA BY AREA TOWN BY TOWN AGREEMENTS TO CEASE HOSTILITIES A LETTER
I THINK THAT THAT DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON WHAT THE RUSSIANS DO WITH THE AIR STRIKES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN CARRYING OUT A REALLY INTENSIVE BOMBARDMENT AROUND A LEPER IN SUPPORT
DOING GOVERNMENT FORCES THE RUSSIANS HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF TERRORISTS FROM WHAT MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD DO BECAUSE THEY INCLUDE ALL THE RUBBLE GROUPS THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR PRESIDENT I THOUGHT IN THEY'VE BEEN CONCENTRATING MOST OF THE AIR STRIKES
ON BOOZE GROUPS THERE'S A FROM THE MAINSTREAM REBEL OR OPPOSITION WHO ARE THE BIGGEST THREAT TO HIS REGIME
ISN'T MUCH FIGHTING NOT MUCH BETWEEN OASIS AND THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ICES ARE LEFT LARGELY ALONE THERE'S A BIT OF FIGHTING BUT NOT MUCH MOST OF IT'S TAKEN DAYS TO MAINSTREAM
THE DEAL AS IT STANDS GIVES RUSSIA LEEWAY TO CARRY ON THOSE STRIPES
WHEN THEY HIT MAINSTREAM REVELS OR CIVILIAN AREAS THEY CAN SAY YES BUT WE'RE TARGETING TERRORISTS SO THERE'S A BIG LOOPHOLE FOR THE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE THE REBELS ON THE GROUND
NO CHANCE WE'RE NOT GIVING UP OUR WEAPONS AS LONG AS HE'S OUR STRIKES CONTINUE FRANK GARDNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN THE AMERICAN DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER HAS SAID BRITAIN SHOULD KEEP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM TRIDENT IF IT WANTS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE WORLD HE WAS SPEAKING TO A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN BILL WHO JOINS US NOW AND JONATHAN WHAT WHAT WERE THE ARGUMENTS PUT FORWARD WHY DID HE SAY THIS
ESSENTIALLY ABOUT BRITAIN'S PLACE IN THE WORLD AND ALSO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND BRITAIN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIP IN DEVELOPING THAT WEAPONS PROGRAMME ALSO BRITAIN'S PLACE WITHIN NATO NOW REMEMBER
OOPS IT SOUNDS LIKE A LINE TO JONATHAN HAS EVAPORATED I WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO IT TO GET IT BACK AND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A CERTAIN IN THE SHORT TERM WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT LINE TO JONATHAN SO WITH THE TIME AT THIRTY MINUTES
IS IT ONE OF THOSE MORNINGS WHERE YOU'RE NOT JUST LOST YOUR LIE BUT MAYBE FORGOTTEN WHERE YOUR KEYS ARE HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND A VAULT I'VE NO IDEA WHERE I PUT THEM IMAGINE FORGETTING WHO YOU ACTUALLY WERE AND THEN THIRTY YEARS LATER
SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO A MAN IN CANADA WHO'S JUST BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY THREE DECADES AFTER A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY SEEM TO ROB HIM OF HIS MEMORY JOIN ON THE LINE NOW BY DOCTOR TIM WILKINSON IS A CLINICAL RESEARCH FELLOW IN NEUROLOGY AT EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY LOOKED WELL CONSIDERED
IT REALLY IS IT'S VERY RARE TO GET A VAN EXTENSIVE MEMORY LOST IT AFTER A HEAD INJURY WE MIGHT EXPECT A BIT OF AMNESIA IN THE SHORT TERM EITHER FOR THE HOURS AND DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT OR IN THE TIME AFTER THE EVENT BUT THAT'S NORMALLY TRANSIENT LIKE THAT'S BETTER BUT TO ACTUALLY LOSE
YOUR IDENTITY YOUR SENSE OF SELF IS EXTREMELY UNCOMMON APPARENTLY STARTED TO EXPERIENCE FLASHBACKS IT WASN'T SO MUCH THAT HE WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAID I KNOW I AM HE STARTED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXPERIENCES OF THE PAST AND ASKED THE SOCIAL WORKER HE WAS IN A HOME IT'S TO CHECK A PARTICULAR NAME WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE HIS NAME IN A D.N.A. TEST THEN CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS INDEED HIM
YES THAT'S INTERESTING SO ALTHOUGH AMNESIA IN THAT WAY IT'S THAT SORT OF AMNESIA IS COMMON LEAST SEEN IN T. V. AND FILM THINKING OF THINGS LIKE JASON BOURNE OR HAROLD BISHOP IN NEIGHBOURS THAT'S REALLY UNCOMMON IN CLINICAL PRACTICE WHERE WE DO SEE IT THOUGH IS A TYPE OF AMNESIA CALLED DISSOCIATIVE AMNESIA WHICH
IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPE OF AMNESIA SO THE MEMORIES ARE THERE BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF PROBLEM WITH ACCESSING THEM AND IT'S INTERESTING AS FLASHBACKS I WOULDN'T IT SO THAT SOME SORT OF INSIGHT INTO THAT HE'S NOT FORGOTTEN WHO HE WAS IT WAS JUST A DIFFICULT DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THOSE MEMORIES AND GRADUALLY THEY CAME BACK IT'S INTERESTING CASE WITH BLOODY PEOPLE LISTENING YOU THINK I WOULD BUT I HAD MEMORY PROBLEMS OBVIOUSLY NOT ON THAT SORT OF SCALE HOW WHEN YOU CLASSIFY
DIFFERENT SORTS OF MEMORY PROBLEMS WHERE THERE WE'RE FORGETTING THINGS IN HER PAST WHERE THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO REMEMBER THINGS IN THE FUTURE HOW DO YOU CLASSIFY SO THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK OF MANY PROBLEMS OF AMNESIA IS IN TWO FORMS THE TYPE OF MEMORY PROBLEM WHERE YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS FROM YOUR PAST SO IF YOU TAKE AN EVENT LIKE A HEAD INJURY THINGS IN YOUR PAST THAT'S CALLED RETROGRADE AMNESIA
EVEN THEN YOU MIGHT OR YOU MIGHT MISS THE ODD MEMORY BUT IT'S VERY UNUSUAL TO FORGET WHO YOU ARE THE OTHER TYPE OF AMNESIA IS WHAT WE CALL AN TERROR GREAT AMNESIA WHICH IS WHICH IS DIFFICULTY MAKING NEW MEMORIES AND WE SEE THAT IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE CERTAIN TYPES OF INJURY TO THE TEMPORAL LOBE WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE NEW MEMORIES THAT'S THE SORT OF THING YOU SEE IN THE FILM MEANT ANTO WHERE HE HE HAS TO REMEMBER HE HAS TO WRITE THINGS DOWN OR TATTOO HIMSELF SO HE CAN KEEP
BUT THE IDEA THAT IN AGE WE GRADUALLY START TO LOSE OUR SHORT TERM MEMORY THAT IS AN EXAMPLE IS IT THEREFORE OF THIS WHAT YOU CALLED ANTERIOR GET EXACTLY WHAT WE SWOT WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE AS THEY GET OLDER AND NORMAL COME TO MADE IN THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY MAKING NEW MEMORIES BUT IT WOULDN'T BE PROFOUND IN CONDITIONS LIKE DEMENTIA USUALLY WHAT WE SEE IN THE EARLY STAGES CERTAINLY IS DIFFICULTY WITH THEIR SHORT TERM MEMORY SO MAKING NEW MEMORIES AND WHEREAS THEIR MEMORIES FOR THINGS LONG AGO A RELATIVELY PRESERVE
O.K. TIM WILKINSON DOCTOR TIM WILKINSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED SIXTY MINUTES PAST SEVEN WELL WE LOST THE LINE TO A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN FEEL WE CAN THEN HEAR THE INTERVIEW HE DID AND IT'S WITH THE AMERICAN DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER WHO HAD SAID THAT BRITAIN SHOULD KEEP TRIDENT NUCLEAR IT'S A NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM IF THE COUNTRY MUST PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE WORLD JONATHAN ASKED HIM HOW MUCH THAT A WEAPON SYSTEM MATTERED TO THE AMERICANS
I THINK THAT THE U.K.'S NUCLEAR DETERGENT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF NATO
ARE OF OUR ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND HELPS THE UNITED KINGDOM TO CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT OUTSIZED RAW ON THE GLOBAL STAGE THAT IT DOES BECAUSE OF ITS MORAL STANDING IN ITS HISTORICAL STANDING IT'S IMPORTANT IT HAD THE MILITARY POWER THAT NURTURES
THAT STANDING AND SO WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT AND OF COURSE WE WORK WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM WERE ACTUALLY INTERTWINED ON THIS PROGRAMME MUTUALLY DEPENDENT
WE WON IT DID HAVE THE PROGRAMME FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES THE U.K. WANTS TO HAVE IT FOR ITS PURPOSES WERE PARTNERS IN THIS VERY STRONG AS WHICH WHICH RAISES A SPECIAL SUSPICION THAT IT'S NOT REALLY AN INDEPENDENT DETERRENT THAT IF THE AMERICANS
FOR EXAMPLE DIDN'T WANT BRITAIN TO FIRE A MISSILE THAT YOU COULD TURN IT OFF WHAT DOESN'T GET DOWN TO OF COURSE WE HAVE INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES DO TO FIRE BUT WHERE WE ARE AS THE PENDANT UPON ONE ANOTHER INDUSTRIAL
WE DEPEND UPON THE UNITED KINGDOM CAME IN DEFENCE OF MY LAST THAT'S PART OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WE BUILT JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER'S TOGETHER WE BUILD TRIDENT MISSILES TOGETHER IT'S PART OF A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
WANT WANT JUST ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS THERE IS AN ARGUMENT OUT THEY'RE MADE BY
THE OPPOSITION PARTY THAT WILL BE UNDERWATER DRONE SOON DEVELOPED THAT CAN DETECT NUCLEAR SUBMARINES UNDER THE WATER WILL BE ABLE TO DESTROY THEM THAT THIS IS JUST WASTED MONEY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT LIFE IN THE ABILITY OF SUCH SUBMARINE
THE DETECTION OPERATES
WELL DEMONSTRATED BY THE NAVIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE ISLAND KINGDOM I'M CONFIDENT THAT I'LL CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE WE WERE IN FACT MAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS
AND YOU SEE FORCES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR EVERYBODY AS WELL
THAT WAS THE AMERICAN DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER SPEAKING TO JONATHAN BILL A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN THREE MEMBERS OF A PALESTINIAN FAMILY WERE KILLED IN AN ARSON ATTACK LAST SOME OF THE DEATHS MADE HEADLINES AROUND THE WORLD NOW TO ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE KILLING OF AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD AND HIS PARENTS IT'S TRIGGERED ANGRY PROTESTS BECAUSE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES NORMALLY USED ONLY AGAINST PALESTINIAN SECURITY PRISONERS
WERE EMPLOYED AGAINST THE JEWISH ISRAELI SUSPECTS THESE TECHNIQUES INCLUDE AMONGST OTHERS SLEEP DEPRIVATION USE OF STRESS POSITIONS AND THE DENIAL OF THE RIGHT TO SEE A LOT TO SEE A LAWYER OR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONNELLY HAS BEEN EXAMINING THE CASE
IN TEL AVIV A LITTLE PLAY ACTING WITH A PURPOSE BUT WHY
A GROUP OF FAR RIGHT JEWISH POLITICAL ACTIVISTS ARE RE ENACTING THE INTERROGATION OF A SUSPECT AT THE HANDS OF THE SHOW BACK ISRAEL'S INTERNAL SECURITY AGENCY I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL O.K. LOVELY ABOVE THEM
THE BLINDFOLDED SUSPECT IS TIED TO A BED FRAME AND BEATEN BY THE INTERROGATORS SHOUT QUESTIONS
IT'S SHOCKING STUFF AND A BANNER HELD BY A PROTESTER IN THE BACKGROUND GIVES A CLUE AS TO WHY SOME ISRAELIS ARE SHOCKED OR IT SAYS DOESN'T TORTURE HER DUE
TO FORCE
TO ADMIT IN THIS CLAIM THAT HE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN BY TORTURING HIM LITERALLY THIS IS THE VOICE OF THE FATHER OF A TEENAGER WHO'S ONE OF TWO YOUNG SETTLERS CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH AN ARSON ATTACK IN THE PALESTINIAN VILLAGE OF DUMA WHICH KILLED THREE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY
THE CASE IS THOUGHT TO BE THE FIRST IN WHICH ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST JEWISH ISRAELI SUSPECTS
THE TEENAGER'S FATHER IS ANGRY AT THEIR USE AGAINST HIS SON AND SCEPTICAL ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS HE WAS BIDDING UP HE WAS SITTING
AND THAT SPECIAL CHEER THIS CORD THE TORTURING CHEER
WHILE HE WAS SCREAMING WITH PAIN AND BEGGING FOR FRIEND HIS INVESTIGATORS TO LET HIM LET HIM GO THEY SAID FINE
IF YOU ADMIT IN THIS MURDERING DUMA WILL LET YOU GO RIGHT O.K. O.K.
SETTLERS AND FOR THE SUPPORTERS THE DECISION OF THE ISRAELI STATE TO USE THE WEAPON OF ENHANCED INTERROGATION IS A SHOP
AND THEY'VE RESPONDED WITH SHOCK TACTICS OF THEIR OWN LIKE THIS DEMONSTRATION OUTSIDE THE HOME IN JERUSALEM OF YOUR AM KOHN THE HEAD OF SHABBAT
ELSEWHERE THOUGH THE ISSUE IS VIEWED THROUGH VERY DIFFERENT LENSES PALESTINIAN SO THE SAME TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST THEM FOR DECADES
A CLEAR DOUBLE STANDARD SAYS XAVIER ABU EAT OF THE P.L.O. IT'S BASICALLY THAT WE'RE NOT SEAMLESS EQUALS BUT THAT'S A MAIN POINT WE'RE NOT IT WAS AT THE SAME ESTATE WHEN HE WAS AT THE SAME EQUAL RIGHTS WE'VE SEEN A TRANSFORMATION MYSTERY SOCIETY THAT IT'S WAY MORE RIGHT WING IN CLOSER TO RELIGION
MANY ISRAELIS WOULD JUSTIFY WHAT'S GOING ON JUST BY SAYING THAT WE'RE JUNK PILES OR NON JEWS LIVING HERE BUT WE DIDN'T WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED AND THAT THE SAME LAWS IT OTHERS WOULD SAY NOT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED UNDER THE SAME HOWEVER WE HAVE A SPECIAL IT CONDITIONS THAT MAKE US DO THIS OR DAD
WATCH IT LOOK FULLER STEAMY MENTION ANOTHER ANGER IN THE WEST BANK AT THE FUNERAL OF A HOUSE
THE ARSON ATTACK ON THE PALESTINIAN VILLAGE OF DOOM WAS A SHOCKING CRIME AND THERE WAS HUGE PRESSURE ON THE AUTHORITIES TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTS AND TO BRING CHARGES
BUT THERE ARE VOICES RAISED INSIDE ISRAEL AGAINST THE USE OF ANYTHING THAT APPROXIMATES TO TORTURE WHATEVER THE EUPHEMISM USED TO DESCRIBE IT
THE VOICE OF YOUNG STEIN FROM THE HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP BUT SALAN IS AMONG THEM IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT WORKS IT CAN BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IT MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO TO PREVENT FUTURE ATTACKS IT DOES A BETTER I MEAN THERE ARE THINGS THAT SOCIETY MUST SAY THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT DONE BOOM BEATING PEOPLE OR TORTURING PEOPLE OR IS TREATING PEOPLE DURING INTERROGATION IS SOMETHING IT'S A STATED THAT WE LIVE IN SHOULD NOT ACCEPT
THE PURPOSE OF ALL THE PROTESTS OF CALLS IS TO MAKE THE TREATMENT OF THE ISRAELI SUSPECTS IN THE DUMA ARSON ATTACK A CENTRAL ISSUE IN THE CASE
AND YOU CAN EXPECT THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REHEARSED ON THE STREETS TO BE PLAYED OUT AGAIN IN COURT WHEN IT COMES TO
ISRAEL OR SAID THAT THE QUESTIONING OF THE SUSPECTS IN THAT DUMA ORSON CASE WAS CARRIED OUT UNDER FULL JUDICIAL SUPERVISION AND IT ALSO SAYS IT DOESN'T DRAW ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN JEWISH AND ARAB SUSPECTS IN THE INVESTIGATION OF TERROR OFFENCES

LEADERS SAY NO TO IT NO PROBLEM OF COURSE WITH ANGELA MERKEL HIS DAVID CAMERON'S BETH YOU BUDDY BUT NOT ALL THE OTHER LEADERS ARE SO FRIENDLY AND AT THIS STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS WITH A WEEK TO GO
SOME OF THOSE ARE VERY BIG LAUGH MAKE YOUR KITCHEN AND ARGUMENT HAVE BEEN LEFT GET GOING I CAN BRACKEN AND WATER DO THOSE BIG ARGUMENTS FOCUS ON AND WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY WORK MOST WORRIED ABOUT WHO MIGHT NOT SIGN UP
I THOUGHT LET ME POINT OUT THAT THERE IS I DON'T KNOW YOU WHAT YOU WERE READING THE SPEECH NOW AND IF I DON'T IF YOU YOU'VE GOT TO SEE ANY OF THE PICTURES FROM LAST NIGHT YOUR MINUTE MASSIVE MEDIEVAL BANQUET HALL BANQUET GOES BACK SIX HUNDRED YEARS THERE'S A REAL FEELING OF CEREMONY ABOUT IT AND PERHAPS YOU MIGHT SAY THEATRE
THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THAT ALL THE BEST AT THIS STAGE EVERYONE NEEDS A BIT OF THEATRE AT THE COOK EUROPEAN COMMISSION IT'S BEING AS THEY WERE VILE DAY IT PUBLICLY BUT THESE DAYS WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS IT WEREN'T FOR SAY LOOK WE FOUND WAYS TO GET BRITAIN WHAT WE WANTED NOT BREAKING RULES
THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL REPRESENTS ALL THE COUNTRIES THEY LOOK IF HE WEAK WE CAN BE A MIDDLEMAN AND AND MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY HERE HAVE PARLIAMENT NORMALLY GET THINK KNOWS A PRESIDENTIAL MARKET FILTH MADE FROM HEADLINE THIS WEEK ABOUT THE PEEL THING PERHAPS MAYBE IT COULD BE REVERSIBLE FACE THEY LIKE BEING IN THE HEADLINE FROM OF COURSE THEY'RE ARE COUNTRY
THAT COULD BE THEIR CITIZENS HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL EFFECTED BY DAVID CAMERON'S REFORMS IF HE GETS A GREAT LUMP AT THE IDEA OF CATHOLIC YOU MIGRANT BENEFIT FOR SOMETHING THAT'S WORRIED POLAND HUNGRY OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SENT AND EASTERN EUROPE THEY NEED A THEATRE OR FEELING THAT RIGHT FOR THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THESE REFORMS
TO PROTECT THEIR THEATRE FILMS AND WHO ELSE ME THAT DAVID CAMERON OF COURSE HE NEEDS TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD TO FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL HARD FOR THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN INSIDE THEY EAT YOU I WANT TO LOOK AT THAT'S ALL DO YOU KNOW THIS WHAT WILL GO ON INTO THE NIGHT AT THE SAME TIME
OVER OVER THE BIKO TO PROTECT SORRY THE IDEA THAT BRITAIN COULD BE PROTECTED INSIDE THE EUROZONE AND THE MIGRANT BENEFIT OF CUTTING YOU MIKE A BENEFIT THAT IF THEY WERE PICKING POINT I WANT TO JUST TO BE A BIT THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER IT'S REVERSIBLE AND ALSO SABRINA OUR OTHER GUESTS MISTER L.F. VERY HARD HIS MORNING TO YOU AND THOUGHT THE BAD PRONUNCIATION OF THE NAME YOU'RE CONCERNED AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE LAW WELL
THIS CLAIM THAT IT WILL HAVE THE POWER OF A EUROPEAN TREATY WHICH DAVID CAMERA AGAIN AND AGAIN HAS MADE ANOTHER IT WON'T BE AN AMENDMENT TO THE TREATY BUT IN EFFECT IT WILL BE YOUR CONCERN THAT THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY RIGHT IN LAW THAT I PUBLISHED A BLOG POST THIS MORNING IN THE CUSTARD SO ANYONE WHO WAS INTERESTED IN THIS AND THERE WAS A TECHNICAL DETAILS CAN ACTUALLY READ THE POST BUT THAT JUST A BIT IS THIS
WE ARE OUTSIDE THE REVISION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATY IS THERE'S A CERTAIN FORMAL WAY OF DOING THAT ONE ARTICLE FORTY EIGHT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO IT'S VERY UNCLEAR WHAT THIS IS I THINK THAT THE TWO SIDES ARE ACTUALLY SEEING THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS A TREATY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH IS LEGALLY BINDING IF YOU ARE ONE IS AN AGREEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH IS LEGALLY BINDING IT UNDER ARTICLE THIRTY ONE SO THAT'S THE TECHNICAL PART OF IT
BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND WHY DOES IT MATTER WELL FRANKLY IT DOESN'T MATTER I MEAN LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IF IT'S THE SECOND IF IT'S AN AGREEMENT WHICH IS WHAT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL LEGAL ADVICE SAYS IT IS IF IT IS AN AGREEMENT
THE COMMISSION WILL BE BROWN AND THIS WILL BE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AS A WHOLE NOT A REVISION TO THE TREATIES BUT SOMETHING THAT'S RELATED TO DO IT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH IRELAND AND DENMARK AND THEY WERE LEGALLY BINDING ACCORDING THE PRIME MINISTER ALWAYS SAYS LET'S JUST REMIND PEOPLE OF PRIMATES AS ALWAYS SAID LOOK OF COURSE WE CAN'T CHANGE THE TREATY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH EVERY PARLIAMENT OTHER REFERENDUMS THAT TAKES TIME BUT WE CAN DO WHAT THE DANES DID IN THE PAST
WHICH IS HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT IN THE FUTURE A TREATY WILL BE CHANGED AND THAT IT HAS THE SAME POWER I'M STILL NOT CLEAR IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME OR YOU SAYING THERE IS A DANGER THAT HE IS WRONG AND IT DID NOT HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME POWER BUT THE DANGER IS THAT THE TWO SIDES THINK OF IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS AND I THINK WHAT CONSEQUENCE
THE FIRST WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT DEPENDS WHAT GOES INTO THE TEXT AND DEPENDS HOW THEY VIEW THEIR AGREEMENT OR DOWN THE LINE IF IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A CLAIM BLEEP GOT OF JUSTICE OR NOT BUT THE GIST OF IT IS THIS THAT IF IT IS A PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL TREATY IT'S AN ENTIRELY NOVEL ARRANGEMENT IT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE YOU WILL HAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATY IS ON THE ONE HAND IN ANOTHER TREATY COMPETING WITH IT
FRAGMENTING THE LEGAL ORDER REMEMBER THIS TO YOU LIKE LOOKS LIKE IT'S MORE BINDING BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ISN'T INVOLVED CATCHER THEY WORRY I SUPPOSE OF EURO SCEPTICS WILL BE THESE THINGS ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND IF THAT JUDICIAL INTO PLEASURES TAKING PLACE IN EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IN LUXEMBOURG IT WILL RARELY GO BRITAIN'S WAY
BUT YOU KNOW AS AS AS WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING THANK YOU AND UNTIL THE DEAL HAS BEEN DONE AND IT HASN'T AND WE STILL HAVE TO WAIT AND THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY IT WON'T EVEN BE DONE NEXT WEEK WE WILL NOT KNOW BECAUSE THAT WAY AGAIN HOW IT IS OR IF NOT LEGALLY WATERTIGHT BECAUSE AS DAVID CAMERON KEEP CLAIMING AND EUROPEAN KEEP COMMISSION KEEP CLEANING IT WILL BE
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IF IT WILL DEFINITELY NEED WHAT'S CALLED SECONDARY LEGISLATION SO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN BRUSSELS WILL HAVE TO VOTE ON ELEMENTS OF THIS DEAL EXAMPLE COULD BEEN GIVE GIVE ME EXAMPLES WE'VE BEEN GIVEN IS THE IDEA OF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT CAN LAST AND SO ON THE IDEA OF CHANGING CHILD BENEFIT
AND ALSO THE IDEA OF SHAM MARRIAGES AVOIDING SHAM MARRIAGES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WELFARE SYSTEM WITH A BROAD AND IN THOSE THREE ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU'LL NEED SECONDARY LEGISLATION IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THEY MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE PRESIDENT OF PARLIAMENT AND SILK
WHAT DAVID CAMERON MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THAT THE EUROPEAN LEADERS CAN THEN BE REVERSED POSSIBLY BY PARLIAMENT EVENT THAT WILL BE DISASTER AGAIN STAY I WHEN IT COMES TO THE AND WHEN WE SAW IT CUT YOU OFF GET TO YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S THE THING ISN'T IT THAT ONE CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES WERE DAY YEAH BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE THAT LITTLE THEM UP PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING IN LIFE INTO A VALUABLE
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN AGREEMENT MADE BECAUSE WHAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAD BEEN DOING LOVE MOTHER HAVING A LOOK AT LAWS AND THE KING AND WHERE THEY CAN BE CHANGED NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT FORGIVE ME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON BUT INDEED WE WILL BE GO ROUND AND ROUND IN CIRCLES FOR SOME TIME AND THAT STORY THANK YOU BOTH TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THERE'S PLENTY OF SCEPTICISM AND ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF OPTIMISM ABOUT THE PLANNED CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND SYRIA
PATRICK COBURN IN THE INDEPENDENT SAYS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP OR THAN AS RIVERFRONT NEVERTHELESS THE ADS FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE'S A PLAN FOR DE ESCALATING THE WAR AND A MECHANISM FOR ENFORCING IT IN THE GUARD INTERVIEW THE OBSTACLES ARE NUMEROUS AND SUBSTANTIAL BUT THE FACT THAT THE U.S. AND RUSSIA HAVE ASSUMED JOINT OWNERSHIP OFFERS SOME GLIMMERS OF HOPE
THE MIRROR SAYS THE PLAN IS FULL OF HOLES BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF WAR ANYTHING IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE TELEGRAPH MIDDLE EAST EDITOR RICHARD SPENCER HOWEVER EVEN BY THE TOPSY TURVY DIPLOMATIC STANDARD SET BY THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR HE AGREEMENT HE SAYS IS ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS HE POINTS OUT THAT THE TERMS WERE AGREED BY WORLD POWERS WHO DIDN'T INCLUDE ANY SYRIANS AND DON'T APPLIED TO ANY OF THESE FOREIGN ACTORS AND IN THE VIEW OF THE TIMES A TRUCE DEMANDS TRUST
AND THERE IS NOT A CEASEFIRE SUGGESTS A POLITICAL PROGRESS PROCESS AND AGAIN THERE IS NONE THERE PAPER BELIEVES IT WILL TAKE MUCH MORE THAN MUNICH WHERE THE CREAM WAS ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY NIGHT TO BRING PEACE TO SYRIA
AND AMBER PAPERS REPORT THE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TO MAKE A PUBLIC APPEAL FOR BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE E.U. THE MAIL SAYS THAT DAVID CAMERON HAS INVITED HIM TO VISIT BRITAIN IN THE SPRING TO BOLSTER THE CASE FOR E.U. MEMBERSHIP ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THERE ARE FEARS IN WASHINGTON THAT THE REFERENDUM IS A DANGEROUS GAMBLE THAT COULD UNRAVEL WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WHOLE OF EUROPE THE GUARDIAN AND THE TIMES REPORT THAT A REVIEW OF RADICALISATION IN JAILS IN ENGLAND AND WALES MAY SUPPORT PUTTING ALL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS INTO ONE UNIT TO STOP THEM PREYING ON THE WEAK INMATES
THE GUARDIAN SAYS THE IDEA OF A BRITISH ALCATRAZ WOULD OVERTURN FIFTY YEARS OF DISPERSING THE MOST DANGEROUS PRISONERS AMONGST SIX MAXIMUM SECURITY JAILS IN A STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE DENIED THAT THERE WERE ANY SUCH PLANS THE MAIL SAYS PUNTERS WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MAXIMUM PRIZE IN WEDNESDAY'S LOTTO DRAW FOR MATCHING FIVE NUMBERS WAS EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POUNDS
HARDLY A LIFE CHANGING SUM IT'S THE LATEST EVIDENCE THE PAPER GOES ON THAT CAMELOT'S DECISION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BALLS FROM FORTY NINE TO FIFTY NINE HAS SPOILED THE GAME FOR MANY BY MAKING IT HARDER TO WIN EXPRESS SAYS IT WAS THE THIRTIETH ROLLOVER SINCE THE RULES WERE CHANGED FINALLY THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT HAS BEEN WRITING ABOUT THE DECISION TO CEASE THE PAPERS PRINT EDITION AND GO EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE AND ALL RIGHT JEN TELLS READERS THAT THE SIMPLE FACT IS THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE PREPARED TO PAY FOR PRINTED NEWS
I KNOW THAT FOR YOU HE WRITES THE NOTION OF US FOCUSING ON DIGITAL DOESN'T APPEAL SO MUCH SHE GOES ON LIKE ME YOU LOVE THE RUSSELL THAN THE WHIFF OF PAPER THE THUD ON THE DOORMAT WHEN IT ARRIVES THE GEOGRAPHY AND THE SERENDIPITY OF EACH EDITION BUT MY PROMISES THE SPIRIT AND THE QUALITY OF THE INDEPENDENT WILL ENJOY
THE TIME IS NOW SEVENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT BRAZIL IS SENDING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS OUT ONTO THE STREETS TO HAND OUT LEAFLETS TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO GET RID OF THE MOSQUITOES WHICH SPREAD THE ZEKE A VIRUS IT'S PART OF A DAY OF ACTION TO TACKLE THE DISEASE
THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASES OF MY CHRIS SETTLE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHEN BABIES ARE BORN WITH A VERY SMALL HEAD HAS RISEN TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BUT NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MORE BABIES ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING THE CONDITION AND IT IS BELIEVED TO BE LINKED TO THE ZEKE AM IRIS PROFESSOR RANSON IS HEAD OF VECTOR BIOLOGY AT THE LIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND JOINS US FROM LIVERPOOL NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS NEWS OF DEPLOYING TROOPS TO INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO
WELL TARGETING THE SKEETER TRANSMITS DISEASE IS THE ONLY WEAPON WE HAVE TO TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION SO I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO TAKE AND BECAUSE THIS DISTANT MOSQUITO CAN BREED PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE IN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH WE'VE HUMAN HOUSES IT DOES TAKE A MASS MOBILISATION OF OF PEOPLE TO GO OUT THERE INFORM THEIR HOUSEHOLDERS OF
WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND THESE MOSQUITOES HELP THE CLEAR UP AND AND THIS IS THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TO TRY AND
TACKLE THE SPREAD OF THIS SO IT'S REALISTICALLY REALLY REALISTIC IS IT THAT THEY COULD GET RID OF THIS MOSQUITO ENTIRELY WELL BRILL HAS MANAGED TO GET RID OF THIS SEAT A SPECIES IN THE PAST BUT SINCE THAT WAS IN THE SIXTIES AND SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD RAPID URBAN SPRAWL AND JUST THIS MESQUITE SPECIES ARE SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HUMAN HABITATION HE'LL BREED IN WATER STORAGE JARS IN IN PLANT POTS
I'M JUST A NUMBER OF BREEDING SITES NOW IN BRAZILIAN CITIES CITIZENS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL SO ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY ARE TAKING THE RIGHT APPROACH AND GOING OUT EN MASSE AND TRYING TO REMOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY ORDERS BREEDING SITES CAN BE FOUND IT IMMENSELY CHALLENGING OH KAY BECAUSE PRESUMABLY EVEN IF YOU IF YOU CAN KILL AS MANY MOSQUITOES AS YOU CAN THERE'S GOING TO BE FEWER CASES OF ZEKE EXACTLY SO HOW DO YOU DO IT HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT REMOVING POOLS OF WATER WHEN YOU PLAY WITH AND EVERY HOUSEHOLD THERE IS SOME FORM OF POOL OF WATER EXACTLY SO ONE FINGERS REALLY
CLEAN UP CAMPAIGN SO IF THERE'S LOTS OF TRASHING IN BACKYARDS AND THINGS I'M JUST CLEANING UP THOSE POOLS OF WATER AND EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO STANDING WATER BUT OF COURSE MANY OF THESE AREAS THERE'S NO PIPED WATER SUPPLY OR IT'S VERY ERRATIC SO PEOPLE NEED SUPPLIES OF WATER THAT THEY CAN RELY ON THEM FOR DRINKING WATER FOR WASHING SO THEY HAVE CANCER OR STORAGE JARS THERE THAT THEY RELY ON SO IN THIS CASE IT'S A CASE OF PUTTING INSECTICIDE INTO THOSE JARS AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE WELL SEALED
RISK YOU JUST CAN'T GET IN AND LAID HER EGGS OH KAY YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE IF YOU CAN'T TURN A TAP ON AND GET WATER WHEN YOU NEED IT YOU WANT TO HOLD ON TO LOVE COURSE YOU DO HAVE OF COURSE YES BUT IF YOU JUST COVER IT UP IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH WELL THESE WHISKIES ARE VERY GOOD AT FINDING EVEN THE TINIEST OF HOLDING IN A STORAGE JAR SO REALLY IT DOES FOR THOSE PERMANENT BUT WITH THE APPARENT AND STORAGE
WATER WE WOULD RECOMMEND THEN THE APPLICATION OF INSECTICIDES OBVIOUSLY EXCEPT SIZE A SAVE TO BE USED IN DRINKING WATER OF WHICH THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL AVAILABLE YOU MAKE THE POINT THAT THEY HAVE ERADICATED IN THE PAST
IF THEY DID THEN WHY COULD THEY NOT DO THAT NOW THIS IS A GLOBAL MOSQUITO SPECIES HOWEVER THEY DID HAVE HAD TO GET FROM MANY COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA IN THE EARLY SIXTIES VERY RAPIDLY REAPPEARED BECAUSE IT AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR MOSQUITO IT'S THE EGGS CAN SURVIVE DRIED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO THEY CAN COME IN OR ON USE TYRES ARE OFTEN A COMMON SOURCE OR POOP SHIPPING CONTAINERS
AND BECAUSE THIS MOSQUITO ITS PRESENT ALL THROUGHOUT THE TROPICS IF ONE COUNTRY ERADICATES IT CAN READILY BE RE INFESTED SNAPPED ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLE HAS TO BE A GLOBAL EFFORT AND I SUPPOSE HOPES ON A VACCINE THEN AS WELL I HOPE SOME OF ACTING TO DO BUT NOT JUST FOR ZEKE UP OF COURSE FOR THE DINGHY AND OTHER OTHER VIRUSES TRANSMITTED BY THIS MOSQUITO SPECIES PROFESSOR HILARY ROUNDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THIRTEEN MINUTES TO ASIAN TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY THE SPEAKER IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING DOCTOR CHECK CHETNIKS JACK KANG A PRIEST IN THE HINDU TRADITION HAVE BACK TO YOUR COOKER MONITORED MORNING A REPORT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND SO THAT OLDER PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER THAN EVER BEFORE SO IF YOU'RE SIXTY FIVE NOW MEN CAN EXPECT TO LIVE TO EIGHTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND WOMEN EIGHTY SIX BUT THERE IS CONCERN THAT TOO MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN POOR HEALTH
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SOCIAL ISOLATION LACK OF ACTIVITY POOR DIET AND A LOT OF ROLE OR PURPOSE CAN ALL INCREASE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS
A LACK OF SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN PARTICULAR INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE IN THE OVER SIXTY FIVES
IN MY WORK AS A CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST I'VE ALL TOO OFTEN SEEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE EXPOSED EXCELLENT MEANT HEALTH UP UNTIL THEY RETIRE WHO'S THEN DESCRIBED TO ME THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO OR WHO TO MEET HAS HAD ON THEIR WILL TO LIVE
CURING SOCIAL ISOLATION WILL BE DIFFICULT GIVEN THAT WE ARE LIVING LONGER THAN EVER BEFORE AFTER RETIREMENT BUT EVEN IF WE COULD I DON'T THINK IT'S THE COMPLETE ANSWER
ALTHOUGH THE VADER'S DO YOU ENCOURAGE STRONG SOCIAL NETWORKS BASED AND SELFLESSNESS AND COMPASSION THEY ALSO HAVE A VIEW ON LIFE AFTER RETIREMENT
NOURISHING THE INNER SELF AS RECOMMENDED AT ALL STAGES OF LIFE BUT IN THE LATER YEARS WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS WITHOUT THE DISTRACTIONS ARE FAMILY AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES THE VEDIC WAY OF LIFE ENCOURAGES THE ELDERLY TO FOSTER THE INNER CONTENTMENT
THROUGH REGULAR SPIRITUAL PRACTICE AND FEEDING THE MIND AND SOUL WITH SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE IT'S RECOMMENDED THAT WE DETACH OURSELVES FROM THE TEMPORARY THINGS THAT DEFINE US HERE AND DEVELOP A RICHER SENSE OF WHO WE ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE EVER CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES OF LIFE
THE SHIFT FROM EXTENDED TO NUCLEAR FAMILIES IN THE U.K. IS A WELL RECOGNISED SOCIAL PHENOMENON BUT THE MOVE AWAY FROM OUR GRANDPARENTS OR GREAT GRANDPARENTS COMES AT A COST AND WE MAY MISS OUT ON VALUABLE GIFTS THAT THE LATER STAGES OF LIFE CAN BRING TO US SUCH AS THE WISDOM OF EXPERIENCE A MORE CONSIDERED PACE AND THE SOFTNESS OF HEART THAT COMES IN LATER LIFE
GROWING UP WHENEVER I NEEDED COMFORT HER ADVICE I WAS ENCOURAGED TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS WHO GAVE ME TIME AND ATTENTION AND SAID JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO RETIRING AT SIXTY FIVE WITH A HEALTHY BALANCE OF INNER AND OUTER HAPPINESS OR HELP ME TO EXPERIENCE A SMOOTHER TRANSITION INTO WHAT COULD BE THEIR BEST YEARS AND ACHIEVE THE PEACE THAT COMES WITH REDEFINING MY PURPOSE
THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WERE DOCTOR CHECK NECKING IT IS NOW TEN TO EIGHT A B.B.C. INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT PAEDOPHILES ARE USING SECRET GROUPS ON FACEBOOK TO GROOM CHILDREN AND SWAP OBSCENE IMAGES THIS IS WHAT SOME OF THOSE AFFECTED WHOSE PICTURES WERE STOLEN BY PAEDOPHILES SAID ABOUT IT THEIR WORDS HAVE BEEN RE VOICED
WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN OF MY DAUGHTER IN HER SCHOOL UNIFORM WERE BEING SHARED IN A SECRET FACEBOOK GROUP RUN BY PAEDOPHILES I WAS HORRIFIED
DO YOU THINK THESE INNOCENT SNAPSHOTS OF MY ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAD BECOME THE SUBJECT OF VILE COMMENTS AND DISGUSTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THESE GROUPS WAS IT WAS REALLY UPSETTING
BEFORE THE B.B.C. CONTACTED ME I WASN'T EVEN AWARE MY PHOTOS WERE BEING USED IN THIS CONTEXT I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH I'M ALSO THINKING WHY ME
NO WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE DANGERS AND RISKS OF PAEDOPHILES OPERATING ONLINE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE PROCEDURES PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN
PUTTING MEASURES IN PLACE TO HAVE THESE GROUPS TAKEN DOWN ONCE REPORTED OR GETTING RID OF THE SECRET GROUP FACILITY ALTOGETHER
WHEN OUR CORRESPONDENT ANGUS CRAWFORD REPORTED TWENTY OF THE WORST PICTURES TO FACEBOOK IT TOOK DOWN FOUR OF THEM THE USER'S DELETED SIX AND TEN WERE LEFT UP
WE JOINED FROM SALFORD NOW BY THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER FOR ENGLAND AND LONGFIELD FROM GUILDFORD BY SHARON GIRLING HIS CHILD PROTECTION SPECIALIST SHE USED TO BE A POLICE OFFICER AND HE'S ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF CEOP THE CHILD EXPLOITATION ONLINE PROTECTION CENTRE GOOD MORNING MORNING GOOD MORNING AND WHEN YOU SAW WHAT THIS REPORT SHOWED WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON FACEBOOK
WELL THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THESE IMAGES IN THESE GROUPS AND THE CONTENT IS SHOCKING AND HORRIFIED AND JUST LIKE ANY CHILD OR ANY PARENT LEARNING ABOUT THEIR OWN IMAGES ON THERE I WAS SHOCKED THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THESE GROUPS ARE BEING USED BY ADULTS WITH A SEXUAL INTEREST IN CHILDREN AND IN MY VIEW THEY'RE PUTTING CHILDREN UP AND NEED TO BE CLOSE DOWN THE THEFT BY THE POLICE AND I THINK FAVES BUT CLEARLY NEED URGENT REVIEW HOW IT RUNS HE'S GROUPS
IF NOT CLOSED THEM ALL TOGETHER AND HOW IT MONITORS AND RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS O.K. WE KNOW THE B. B. C. HANDED THE WORSE THE MATILDA THE POLICE IN THERE'S ONE SECRET THAT IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL IN THAT'S RIGHT INVESTIGATION WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT IS THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I DO WANT TO DO AND PLAN TO DO IS MEET WITH FACEBOOK TO MAKE MY OWN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ACTIONS THEY HAVE NOW SAID THAT THEY WILL TAKE ACTION URGENTLY I WANT TO BE REASSURED THAT THAT IS THE CASE
SO I'LL BE LOOKING TO MEET WITH THEM OVER THE COMING DAYS I ALSO PLANNED TO CONVENE A MEETING BETWEEN FACEBOOK THE POLICE AND ACTUALLY THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT APARTMENT BECAUSE PART OF THIS IS LOOKING AT MAKING GOOD OF THE CURRENT SITUATION BUT ALSO THERE'S MUCH TO BE GAINED I THINK BY LOOKING AT HOW WE PREVENT THIS HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE BUT ALSO HOW WE USE THAT INTELLIGENCE
IN GETTING ACCESS AND UNDERSTANDING PERPETRATORS AND BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE SO ON ALL THOSE COUNTS I'LL BE LOOKING TO TAKE ACTION SHARON GOING TO BRING YOU IN HERE BECAUSE FACEBOOK US THEN THAT STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CHILD EXPLOITATION AND THAT ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR LIKE THIS IS RARE AND THEY CLAIM IF THEY COME ACROSS IT'S IMMEDIATELY REMOVED AND REPORTED TO TO AGENCIES DO YOU BUY
TO SOME DEGREE I DO UNTO OTHERS I KNOW FULL WELL THAT THEY COULD DO FAR MORE I MEAN WE'D WE'RE NEVER SEEING WE NEVER BEING TOLD BY THEN WHAT ACTUALLY THEY ARE DOING THE FACT THAT THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY HAVE THIS PRETTY HORRIFIC AND PRETTY HORRIFYING AND IT ALMOST TAKES ME BACK TO THE MID NINETIES WHEN WE HAD NEWS COS THIS IS THIS IS KIND OF THE SAME FUNCTION AS A NEWS GROUP HELD
THE FACT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONTENT IS BEING USED IN THIS WAY IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BY THEN AND I THINK FACEBOOK HAD BECOME A LITTLE BIT AS SOME OF THE OTHER SITES HAVE AS WELL A LITTLE BIT TOO COMFORTABLE WITH OUR INFORMATION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE USING IT
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IS THERE THOUGH BECAUSE I MEAN ONE IMAGINES THE SCALE OF THIS AND THE RANGE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE MORE SEVERE STUFF ARGUABLY COULD BE PICKED UP BY SOME CODE BUT HOW DO YOU GET STUFF THAT PERHAPS IS JUST HE'S NOT NOT SO EXTREME THEY SHOULDN'T BE PRODUCING SOMETHING IF I CAN'T MANAGE IT I'LL MONITOR IN THE WAY IN WHICH IT SHOULD BE DONE APPROPRIATELY
SO I DON'T BUY THE FACT THAT THE VOLUME OUT THERE IS TOO MUCH FOR THEM TO HANDLE YES THEY COULD QUITE EASILY WITH ENHANCING THEIR OUT RHYTHMS IDENTIFY WHICH GROUPS THEY ARE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FACEBOOK IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND CARERS AS WELL WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS OH KAY WILL BUT THAT WITCH WHAT CAN PARENTS DO BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY SOMEBODY WE HEARD THAT IN THAT EXAMPLE OVER AT A BUS STOP TAKING A PICTURE OF A CHILD WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THAT
YOU'VE GOT TO BE LOOKING FOR YOUR OWN CONTENT SO MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE CHECKING ONLINE TO SEE HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS BEING PUT IN YOUR OWN NAME INTO THE SEARCH ENGINE'S PUTTING PICTURES IF YOU FIND YOURSELF PUTTING THEM INTO THE SEARCH ENGINES AS WELL AND IT WILL GO OUT AND FIND ALL THE OTHER CONTENT AS A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THEY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS THEY COULD HAVE THAT CONTENT REMOVED VERY RAPIDLY BUT YOU HAD IT YOU'D NEED A NAME ATTACHED TO IT HANKY CAN YOU IS IT POSSIBLE TO TRACK YOUR OWN PICTURES ABSOLUTELY IT IS YEAH
BY SIMPLY PUT YOUR PICTURE INTO THOSE GOOGLE IMAGES OR INTO YOUR SEARCH ENGINE IMAGES AND IT WILL BRING THOSE PICTURES BACK AND IDENTIFY THEM FOR YOU BUT ANYBODY WITH TEENAGE CHILDREN KNOWS HOW MUCH HE'S POSTED ONLINE I'M STRUGGLING TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO A TRAWL AND CONTAIN ALL THAT
WELL IT IS DIFFICULT BUT IF WE'RE PUTTING A CONTENT OUT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IN MANY CASES WE ARE DOING THAT I ACCEPT THE BUS STOP ONE IS IS A UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IN MOST CASES YOU KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND I'VE GOT SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS TELLING ME THAT THEY'VE GOT A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT BECAUSE MUM AND DAD HAVE GIVEN THEIR OLD MOBILE PHONE AND THEY'VE JUST GOT ON THEIR INSETS ARE THAT THE ACCOUNT UP
WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AS PARENTS AND CARERS THAT SOME OF THIS IS DOWN TO US AS WELL OH CABLE WE HEARD THERE WAS A STORY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF YOUNG WITHOUT MY MUM IS TWEET TOOK AT THAT THAT SORT OF PRE TEEN STAGE HAVING IT INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS WHEN YOU'VE GOT THAT SORT OF ACCESS YOU ARE CAN'T RAIN BACK FROM THAT
NO UNFORTUNATELY ONCE IT'S THERE IT'S THERE WE CAN'T REMOVE IT WE CAN REMOVE IT IT'S ILLEGAL CONTENT WE CAN WORK HARD WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO GET THAT CONTENT REMOVED BUT IT IS A MESS A MESSAGE NEEDS TO COME OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE WAS ONLY POST IMAGES THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE CONTROL OF BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE POSTED IT ONLINE THE CHANCES ARE IT'S NO LONGER YOURS AND IT'S GONE FOREVER AND HOW MUCH OF THIS DO YOU THINK IT'S DOWN TO THE RESPONSIBILITY WERE UNDER THE CONTROL OF FAMILIES RATHER THAN
AND FACEBOOK WELL FAMILIES CLEARLY PLAY THEIR PART AND PART OF HELPING CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIVACY AND PARENTS MUST CHECK PRIVACY SETTINGS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR CHILDREN HELP THEM DO THAT FACEBOOK A TRUSTED PART OF OUR LIVES MANY OF US REALLY INTEGRAL TO A LOT OF OUR SOCIAL NETWORKS THEY MUST WORK HARD TO RETAIN THAT TRUST CHILDREN OR BUILD A BIG ISSUES OF THE INTERNET THAT IT WASN'T BUILT FOR THEM AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT THEM WITHIN IT FACE BUT NOW HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY COME FROM POOLE THAT DUTY OF CARE THEY HAVE
AND SHARON GIRLING IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WAY THEY GO ABOUT IT WHO IS IT HOW DO THEY ARRANGE THE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING ALL IN SOME CASES ARE CERTAINLY KNOW A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK THEY OUT SOURCED THE CHECKING OF THE CONTENT OUT TO MOROCCO AND THEY WERE PAYING PAYING PEOPLE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ON A DAILY BASIS TO CHECK THE CONTENT AND THEY HAD A CRITERIA FOR DOING THAT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY STILL DO THEY THEY'VE NOT CONFIRMED OR DENIED THAT
SO I THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE BETTER TRAINED PEOPLE IN THIS DAY AND AGE THEY NEED TO HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED THAT ENABLES THESE GROUPS AND SOME OF THE WORDING THAT WERE IN SOME OF THE GROUPS SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ERADICATED SHARON GIRLING AND LONGFIELD THANK YOU BOTH THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER WITH THOMAS CHEF AND I GET IS THE BIG CHILL COMING THOMAS CERTAINLY CHILL IN THE AIR I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY CALL IT A BIG CHILL BUT THERE ARE A FEW WINTRY SHOWERS AROUND IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY
MORE THAN ANYTHING IT'S GREY AND COLD WITH SOME RAIN ON AND OFF ACTUALLY FOUGHT FOR MANY OF US TODAY THAT'S ACROSS THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY SO CORNWALL DEVON SOUTHERN COUNTIES ALL THE WAY TO LONDON THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON IT WILL BE CLOUDY THERE'LL BE SOME RAIN ON AND OFF EVEN QUITE HEAVY AT TIMES AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN QUITE WET ACROSS THE SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND TEMPERATURES EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WILL BE NO HIGHER THAN AROUND FIVE DEGREES ADD ON AN EASTERLY WIND
DOESN'T FEEL VERY PLEASANT AT ALL AND SOME OF THAT WEATHER WILL ALSO BE CLIPPING THE SOUTH OF WALES ALREADY HAS THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGH THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON BUT FURTHER NORTH SAY BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE NORTH MIDLANDS I THINK A LITTLE BIT DRIER HERE THEY MIGHT EVEN BE SOME BRIGHTNESS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON STILL CHILLY IT'S TWO DEGREES NOW IT WON'T GET ANY WARMER THAN AROUND FIVE DEGREES
THE NORTH EAST OF ENGLAND AND EASTERN SCOTLAND HERE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOME WINTRY SHOWERS OVERNIGHT THOSE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY SO MAYBE A LITTLE COVERING ACROSS THE HILLS MADE FOR SOME OF THE TOWNS AND CITIES FOR THE DOWNHILL TOO FOR NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REST OF SCOTLAND I THINK IT SHOULD BE A DRY DAY AND I MIGHT EVEN BE SOME BRIGHTNESS FOR THE WESTERN ISLES TODAY CHILLY TONIGHT BETTER TOMORROW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOMAS NOW NEXT WEEK READY FOR EXAMINES THE STORY AND LEGACY OF A BATTLE THAT SHAPE THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO NATIONS
A TEMPEST GROWING STEADILY WORSE IN WHICH THE RAIN CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF COBBLESTONES IN WHICH THE HAIL IS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF MASONRY

REBEL COMMANDERS SAY THEY'D TO INTEND TO CARRY ON FIGHTING UNTIL PRESIDENT ASSAD LEAVES POWER AND SAUDI ARABIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS TOLD THE MINUTE SECURITY CONFERENCE THERE CAN BE NO CHANCE OF DEFEATING ISLAMIC STATE IN SYRIA WELL PRESTON REMAINS
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS TOLD GERMAN BUSINESS LEADERS THAT HE CAN WIN A REFERENDUM TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IF YOU AGAINST THE CHANGES HE'S SEEKING BUT SPEAKING AT A DINNER IN HAM BACK LAST NIGHT ATTENDED BY CHANCELLOR MERKEL HE SAID THAT IF HE DIDN'T GET A DEAL HE RULED NOTHING OUT IT WAS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF VISITS HIS MADE TO EUROPEAN CITIES TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR HIS PROPOSALS BEFORE AN IMPORTANT MEETING AT THE E.U.

HOWEVER BROADER AIMS MAY LIE BEHIND THIS MEETING THE VATICAN THEY HOPE TO HELP ROMAN CATHOLICS IN RUSSIA AND THE CHURCH IN UKRAINE OR PATRIARCH GRILL THEY WISH TO BOOST HIS STANDING WITHIN THE ORTHODOX CHURCH
THE U.S. DEFENCE SECRETARY ASH CARTER SAYS BRITAIN MUST KEEP ITS TRIDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT IF IT WANTS TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE WORLD A COMMON STATE ON THE ISSUE WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE LATER THIS YEAR THEY BIT IS REPAIRING ITS POSITION ON THE ISSUE AS CARTER TOLD THE B. B. C. THAT TRIDENT ALLOW BRITAIN TO PUNCH ABOVE ITS WEIGHT

NEW RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE DYING PREMATURELY EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE DEATHS ARE SAID TO BE IN CHINA AND INDIA ARE SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN AMOS REPORTS
AIR POLLUTION IS NOW THE FOURTH HIGHEST RISK FACTOR FOR DEATH GLOBALLY ACCORDING TO THE DATA COMPILED BY THE INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE PROJECT TINY LIQUID AND SOLID PARTICLES BREATHED IN CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE
WHILE DEVELOPED NATIONS HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM THE NUMBER OF CITIZENS DYING AS A RESULT OF POOR AIR QUALITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS STILL CLIMBING IN CHINA IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION DEATHS A YEAR IN INDIA IT'S ROUGHLY ONE POINT THREE
THE SOURCES OF POLLUTION ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT HOWEVER IN CHINA THE PARTICLE EMISSIONS COME FROM COAL BURNING IN INDIA IT'S PARTICULATES RESULTING FROM THE PRACTICE OF BURNING WOOD AND OTHER MATERIALS FOR COOKING AND HEATING THE PROJECT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING HARD TO GET ON TOP OF THE ISSUE BUT SAY THE FIGURES INDICATE THEIR EFFORTS NEED TO BE RE DOUBLE

SCIENTISTS IN CALIFORNIA HAD DEVELOPED A NEW RAP FOR SMART PAINTS THAT COULD BE USED TO MONITOR EARTHQUAKES KNOWN AS MY SHAKE THE APP HARNESSES THE SOPHISTICATED MOTION SENSORS INSIDE THINGS TO DETECT EARTH TREMORS EVEN AT THE DEVICES IN A POCKET OR BAG THE DEVELOPERS HOPING TO RECRUIT THOUSANDS OF POO NEEDS US TO BUILD UP A DATA GATHERING NETWORK COULD ALSO ISSUED WARNINGS ABOUT IMPENDING EARTHQUAKE
THANK YOU COREY IT'S TEN PAST EIGHT WHAT NEXT FOR THE N.H.S. AFTER THIS TUMULTUOUS WEEK AFTER THE STRIKE AFTER THE DECISION TO IMPOSE A NEW CONTRACT AFTER THE WARNINGS THAT JUNIOR DOCTORS WILL QUIT OR MOVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHAT WILL BE THE FALL OUT FOR THE HEALTH SERVICE NOT JUST ENGLAND BUT ELSEWHERE AND FOR THE OTHERS WHO WORK IN IT AND FOR THOSE OF COURSE WHO DEPEND ON IT
I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY CHRISTINA MCKINNEY WHO'S THE HEAD OF HEALTH UNISON AND CHAIRS THE N.H.S. STAFF COUNCIL WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER ALL THE TRADE UNIONS REPRESENT TWO AND ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORKERS WHO WORK IN THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND JOINED ALSO ON THE LIVE BY PAUL BROOKS OVERSEAS DOCTORS JOBS AGENCY HE WORKS FOR IN OTHER WORDS HE WORKS FOR AN AGENCY THAT TRIES TO FIND BRITISH DOCTORS JOBS ABROAD IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO LET'S START WITH YOU IF WE COULD CHRISTINA NOW
DO YOU REGARD THIS AS NOT THE END OF EVEN ONE BATTLE BUT THE BEGINNING OF A WAR BETWEEN N.H.S. STAFF THEIR EMPLOYERS AND THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THIS WHOLE IDEA ABOUT WHETHER YOU DO OR DO NOT GET PAID EXTRA FOR WORKING AT THE WEEKENDS I THINK IT COULD BECOME A WAR I'M HOPING IT WON'T BUT I THINK THE MOST WORRYING THING FOR ME AS HAS BEEN THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO IMPOSE THEIR ON THE JUNIOR DOCTORS BECAUSE I THINK THAT SEND IT A VERY
WORRYING MESSAGE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF STAFF WHO WORK IN THE N.H.S. THAT IF THEY CAN DO THIS TO THE DOCTOR'S AND LET'S BE HONEST A BIT LESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STAFF IN THE N.H.S. I CAN PARTICULARLY DOCTORS ARE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN SO FOR EVERYBODY ELSE AS REALLY WORRIED THAT IF WE CAN DO IS TO DOCTORS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR US AS NURSES PARAMEDICS PORTERS CLEANERS CATERERS WHATEVER YOUR DOOR BEARS AND THE N.H.S. LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT SORT OF TERMS THOSE DIFFERENT GRADES ARE UP WITHOUT GETTING INTO EVERY DETAIL
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BONUS STILL IS THERE FOR OTHER WORKERS IF THEY WORK ON A SATURDAY OR IF THEY WERE LATE AT NIGHT THEY ARE THE MOST WEATHER WILL GET SO FOR WORKING A SATURDAY DURING THE DAY HE WOULD GET YOU CLEAN TAME PLUS THIRTY PER CENT AND IF YOU WORK IT MATES SOME WILL GET AN EXTRA FIFTY PER CENT FOR WORKING MORE THAN MATE THERE'S A DEFINITE STRUCTURE ENTIRELY FROWNED ON STAFFORDSHIRE JUST SEE BECAUSE THE WORKS A CONSTANT CHEST SO THEN OR SINCE IS A QUESTION FOR YOU WAS A TRADE UNION NEGOTIATOR
ARE YOU FIGHTING ABOUT HOW MUCH EXTRA IN TERMS OF BASIC PAY WORKERS COULD GET TO COMPENSATE THEM IF THE EMPLOYERS AND THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO GET RID OF THESE OVERTIME PAYMENTS FOR SATURDAY WORKING AND EXTEND THE YOU CAN WORK BEFORE YOU GET OVERTIME
OR ARE YOU SAY NEVER FORGET IT WE'RE NOT DOING IT SATURN IS DIFFERENT YOU HAVE TO PAY US DIFFERENT I THINK GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT CERTAIN STAFF IT'LL TEND TO WORK WEEKENDS ON MATES AND THEN YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE CHUNK OF STAFF ARE DOING NOT AS PARAMEDICS IN ALL OUR PEOPLE WORK IN THE CANTEEN EXCEPT WHO WILL WORK A RANGE OF CHET IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO ROCK WAS A PACKAGE THAT THAT
PEAS EVERYONE THE SEAM SO RECOGNISING THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE DO THESE KIND OF WEEKENDS AND OVER MAKE CHEF TS AND I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE COULD RECOMPENSE FOR THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPACT CHEF TO WORK WORKING HAS ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND ALL WE TALK ABOUT TRUE THAT SHOULD'VE NIGHT WORK ISN'T IT WAS NOT TO HAVE SATURDAY WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A WHOLE SERIES OF JOBS WHO REGARD SATURDAYS JUST
ANOTHER DAY THEY DO BUT FULL OF THE HEALTH WORKERS MOST OF THEM WORK A C.D.S OF CHEF SO YOU WON'T JUST WHACK A SATURDAY YOU WANT JUST WHAT MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY SATURDAY YOU USED TO BE ROAST TO WORK HER SHIFT WHICH WILL INCLUDE SATURDAYS SUNDAYS AND FOR MANY STAFF MAKE CHEF TO THE CURIOUS THING ABOUT THIS JUNIOR DOCTORS DISPUTE WHEN HE SPOKE TO BOTH SIDES AWAY FROM THE DOOR IS AWAY FROM THE SOUND BITES AND INDEED THE CHIEF NEGOTIATORS SAID THIS IN AN INTERVIEW TODAY IN THE TIMES THE GAT
APPEARED TO BE TINY AND IT WAS ABOUT THE EXACT AMOUNTS IN WHICH PEOPLE WERE COMPENSATED THE IDEA THAT THERE WERE SOME GREAT PRINCIPLED ARGUMENT THAT DOCTORS SHOULD NOT WORK ROUTINELY ON A SATURDAY NOBODY WAS HOGGING THAT ON EITHER SIDE AND INDEED IT WAS REALLY WHAT ALL THEIR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN TRADE UNIONISTS AND EMPLOYS ABOUT IS JUST WHETHER THE SUMS ARE QUIET RIGHT WHETHER THE FIGURES QUITE ADD UP
THERE'S A MIXTURE OF THINGS AS A BIT OF MONEY BUT BOTTOM LINE MEMBERS KILL BUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE TAKE HOME BUT I THINK WITH RECOGNISING THE FACT THAT N.H.S. WORKERS AND BUT LET'S MESS THAT SOMEHOW THIS WAS A BIT ENCOURAGING THEM TO WORK WEEKENDS THEY WILL MOST OF THE WHAT WEEKEND WHAT CHEFS DO WORK SATURDAYS DO WHAT'S ON THESE NOT ALL BUT ALP ON THE MAJORITY OF STUFF YOU WANT ME AND JASE
DO GOING TO SHIFT AND IT'S SORE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE ABOUT GETTING THEM TO WHAT THIS IS THIS WAS ABOUT THE MONEY AND HOW MUCH MONEY THE GOVERNMENT WAS PREPARED TO FUND KIT TO PUT END TO FUND THE EXTENSION OF SEVENTIES SERVICES AN AIR FEELING AS THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO SIXTEEN SEVENTY SERVICES BUT HE DON'T WANT TO FIND THAT YOU WANT STAFF TO FIND IT THROUGH EXCEPT AND CUTS TO PEEING CONDITION
YES OF COURSE LET ME TO CRUDE POINT BUT IF MONEY GOES TO STAMPEDE IS NOT GOING TO PATIENTS THERE IS A LIMITED BUDGET FOR THE N.H.S. YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SPEND YET MORE MONEY ON THE HEALTH SERVICE OVERALL THE MONEY'S GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE I DO THINK WE SHOULD SPEND MORE MONEY I THINK WE HAVE AN F. POSSESSION IS A COUNTRY WHERE WE SPEND LACES AS A PERCENTAGE OF G.D.P. THAN LOADS OF COUNTRIES AND EUROPE NOW IT WAS MY WORD FIRST OF ALL BUT YOU SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE A WAR
OVER THIS DO YOU THINK WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE MORE STRIKES FROM MORE N.H.S. WORKERS AS THE GOVERNMENT THINKS RIGHT WE'VE STARTED WITH A JUNIOR DOCTOR'S LETTERS WORK THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT GRADES THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STAFF AND IMPOSE CONTRACT IF THERE'S AN EVER THERE'S A MOVE TO THE MOVE IF THERE'S A MOVE TO TAKE AWAY WE CUT THE UNSOCIAL HOURS PAYMENTS MEMBERS GEAR THEN YEAH I THINK ISAIAH AND ALL OF THE OTHER UNIONS DIED THAT IDEAL WEAPON THE SIXTEEN UNIONS AS YOU SAID NO
HAVE ALL SAID IF THERE'S A CUT AND UNSOCIAL HOURS PAYMENTS AT ALL AND THEN POSSESSION THEN I THINK THEY WOULD LOOK TO TO TAKE SOME KIND OF ACTION LET ME BRING HIM PAUL BROOKS NOW HE'S BEEN LISTENING TO THIS AS I SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION HE WORKS FOR AN AGENCY CALLED OVERSEAS DOCTORS JOBS WHICH SORT OF DOES WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN ARE YOU GETTING A LOT MORE ENQUIRIES MY BOOKS ABOUT DOCTORS YOU DO WANT TO GO OVERSEAS
A FEW I THINK IT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT MOST DO NOT SEEM TO BE WANTING TO GO OVERSEAS YET AS JUNIORS IT'S THE DOCTORS WHO'VE GOT THEIR SPECIALISATION WHO ARE LOOKING TO MOVE OVERSEAS SO CHEAP PEAS
HEY ANY DOCTORS IF YOU WERE A JUNIOR AND HE DID WANT TO GO OVERSEAS AND OF COURSE MANY OF THEM HAVE SAID SO HE'S PART OF THIS PROTEST WITH ACTUALLY FIND THE JOBS WERE THAT WELL THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM I THINK THE TRADITIONAL PLACES LIKE AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND THERE ARE MANY FEWER JOBS NOW THAN THERE WERE THEY'VE TRAINED QUITE A LOT OF THEIR OWN DOCTORS THERE ALREADY MORE DOCTORS IN AUSTRALIA PER HEAD OF POPULATION THAN WE HAVE HERE BY QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER
AND I JUST DON'T THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR THE DOCTORS WITHOUT THEIR SPECIALISATION IT CHANGES COMPLETELY ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR SPECIALISATION OF COURSE SO THE ADVICE TO A JUNIOR DOCTOR IF THEY WANT TO ESCAPE IS YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT EASILY BUT YES IF YOU THEN GO ON AND QUALIFIED BECOME A CONSULTANT OR INDEED CHANGE AND BECOME A GENERAL PRACTITIONER THAN THE POTENTIAL IS THERE ABSOLUTELY YES AND BRITISH TRAINING ARE STILL
AMONGST THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND GIVES YOU A LICENCE TO GO TO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE'S THE REVERSE IS NOT TRUE AND THAT IS THE GRASS ALWAYS GREENER AS IT WHERE DO YOU GET SOME PEOPLE RING YOU UP AFTER SIX MONTHS AGO BOYD PAUL THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED WE'RE GOING TO BE THE JOB OVERSEAS BUT IT'S REALLY NOT AS GOOD IT'S NOT THAT MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS I HOPE NOT WITH G.P.S THE OPPORTUNITIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE DEFINITELY BETTER IS FAIRLY CLEAR CUT
THAT THEY'RE GETTING A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND HER PEAS BUT LEFT HANGING WALLS WITH SOME PEOPLE WELL ANY POSSIBLY HOSPITAL DOCTORS YOU MEAN SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOUR BUSINESS O.K. ABSOLUTELY NOT NO NO I'M NOT I'M NOT WORRIED BY THAT AT ALL I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AND IT'S NOT SO EASY WITH THE HOSPITAL DOCTORS A LOT OF HOSPITAL DOCTORS GO ON A ONE YEAR FELLOWSHIP WHERE IT'S A SORT OF TIME LIMITED JOB ANYWAY RATHER THAN A PERMANENT POST
SOME WILL TURN THAT INTO A LONG TERM JOB AND STAY OUT THERE IF THEY CAN BUT A LOT DO COME BACK PICK UP THEIR TRAINING BACK HERE AND THEN CONSIDER THEIR OPTIONS AFTERWARDS SO IT'S A GREAT MOVE
TO GO TO EXPERIENCE THE HEALTH CARE OUT THERE AND TO GAIN GAIN THE EXPERIENCE YOU CAN GET THE TRAIN ANOTHER PANACEA YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS NO AND THE MONEY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS EITHER PAUL BROOKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED CHRISTINA MACARI THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU IT'S NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES PAST EIGHT HERE'S A TELEVISION ADVERT FOR THE INDEPENDENT FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE
DONALD SHARK DON'T SUCH DON'T DON'T WALK AT NIGHT DON'T WALK ON THE RIGHT DON'T TRAIN DON'T FAINT DON'T SMILE DON'T DO DRUGS DON'T BELIEVE DON'T DO JUNK DON'T MEAN FAT DON'T THEY DON'T SHOOT
DON'T REBEL DON'T SMACK DON'T CHANGE DON'T MASTURBATE DON'T BE CHILDISH DON'T BE OLD DON'T BE ORDINARY DON'T BE DIFFERENT DON'T STAND OUT DON'T DROP OUT NO I DON'T REALLY
AND THAT OF COURSE BECAME THE PROBLEM FOR THE INDEPENDENT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE READ IT
FROM ITS HEYDAY IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN IT WOULD SELL FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES NOW IT ONLY SELLS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THAT'S WHY AFTER ALMOST THIRTY YEARS IT'S LAST PAPER EDITION WILL BE NEXT MONTH AND FROM THEN IT WILL ONLY
BE ONLINE WHILE LISA MARK WELL HE'S THE EDITOR OF THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY AND SHE IS HERE WITH US IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE JOB LOSSES THE OWNERS HAVE SAID THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOB BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU AND YOU'RE THE PARTICULAR STAFF THAT YOU WORK WITH
WELL FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND TITLES WE'RE GOING TO CARRY ON FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS AFTER I'VE FINISHED HERE I'M OFF INTO THE OFFICE WITH MY AMAZING TEAM TO BRING OUT A PAPER TOMORROW SO WE'RE FOCUSING ON THAT RIGHT NOW THE SALE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT OFF PAPER TO JOHNSTON PRESS SOME STUFF WILL GO WITH A GUY BECAUSE I OF COURSE WAS ALWAYS GENERATED FROM THE INDEPENDENTS CONTENT INITIALLY HAS GROWN ON ITS OWN BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
BRILLIANT BRILLIANT JOURNALISTS INVOLVED WITH INDEPENDENT TITLES SOME OF THEM WILL GO WITH I NOT ALL AND THE INDEPENDENT DOT CO DOT U.K. DIGITAL BRAND WILL NEED A LOT OF JOURNALISTS TO BOLSTER THAT UP THERE THEY'RE LEBEDEV FAMILY WHO STILL THEN
THE INDEPENDENT TITLE WANT THAT TO BE A REAL FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH DIGITALLY SO NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE JOBS I'M JUST FOCUSING ON BRING OUT GREAT I'VE TOMORROW REALLY APPRECIATE A REALLY TOUGH TIME FOR YOU BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN A WAY I MEAN PEOPLE ARE READING ONLINE SO DO YOU THINK DO YOU THINK LOOK IF THEY'LL HAVE ME WE WILL JUST MOVE OUR TEAM IF WE CAN IF THEY'RE PAYING OBVIOUSLY WE WILL MOVE ON TEAM ONLINE
WE'LL CARRY ON DOING WHAT WE DO THAT WE'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT TERRIBLY DEPRESSING THAT PEOPLE DON'T WE'LL HAPPILY PAY THREE POINT SEVENTY FOR AN APPALLING COFFEE FROM A TAKE OUT PLACE AND YET THEY WON'T PAY ONE POINT SIXTY OR TWO PANS FRENCH ON A SUNDAY FOR WHAT IS AN EFFECTED HER NOVELS WORTH OF TERRIFIC WRITING BUT YOU KNOW HEY
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AND I THINK ALL NEWS ORGANISATIONS HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING BUT
TAKING ALL OF THAT ONLINE AND PEOPLE NOT PAYING ANYTHING FOR THAT IS IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT BUSINESS MODEL I MEAN I THINK WE'RE IN A REAL STATE OF FLUX WITH HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HUGE ONLINE PRESENCE IS LIKE THE GUARDIAN YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY MONEY SO WE'RE LOSING THE LISA AND SHE'S SO REALLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AT WHICH I THINK ORGANISATIONS HAVE TO LOOK AT
WHAT ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY FOR I MEAN OTHER INNIT IN THE NEW YORK TIMES HE HAS PAY PAID THE TIMES AS A PAYROLL AS SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT WAYS WHERE YOU PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT YOU GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CONTEMPORARY AND THE F. TWO PEOPLE IN IT SO THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE IT'S A GAMBLE REALLY ISN'T IT IT IS AND IF THEY DID THE LEBEDEV FAMILY WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE PAPERS SIX YEARS AGO
WE WERE AT THAT POINT RUPERT LOSING SO MUCH MONEY IN THE PAPER WAS ABOUT I MEAN I'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE BEEN TOLD SO MANY TIMES PAPERS ABOUT CLOSE BUT I THINK IT REALLY WAS A DIFFICULT TIME SO ABSOLUTELY JUST FOR KEEPING US GOING FOR THIS AMOUNT OF TIME BUT IT WAS EXPENSIVE TO INVEST IN JOURNALISM AND EVEN THOUGH WE'VE CUT OUR COSTS TO THE ABSOLUTE BONE I MEAN I WAS SAYING EARLIER THAT CORE STUFFED IN PEN ON SUNDAY
HE'S A SHOCKING NUMBER OF TWELVE SO YOU CAN'T CUT ANY FURTHER THAN THAT BUT ANY INVESTMENT IN JOURNALISM IS EXPENSIVE SO REALLY IT IS A CHALLENGE AND IT IS A RISK AS YOU SAY BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THEY WERE JUST TALK ABOUT THE SAND IN AND I SUPPOSE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT SOMEBODY'S GOING EFFECTIVELY WEDDING THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE REST OF THE WEEK AND SUNDAY BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHO THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING ON LINE NOW AND THE INDEPENDENT AND YOU'RE STOPPING YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IS THERE A DIFFERENCE
THERE IS I MEAN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A DIFFERENCE I THINK THE INDEPENDENT WAS QUITE SLOW EVERYONE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE TO GET ON BOARD WITH DIGITAL AND IT'S GROWING VERY VERY QUICKLY IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DIGITAL HAVE BEEN RECRUITED AS ALTERED DINOSAURS WHO CARE ABOUT PRENT YOU KNOW HAVE LUMBERED ALONG DOING LONG FROM JOURNALISM WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY WEB FRIENDLY BUT I THINK THAT THAT SORT OF GAP HAS IS
IS NARROWING AS WE LEARNED AND SORT OF FLEECE AFFECT JOURNALISTS WE ARE AS A TRAY QUITE FLEET OF FOOT WE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL MAKE THAT CHANGE VERY EASILY AT THAT HOLD ON FORM JOURNALISM IS THAT GONE NOW DO YOU THINK WELL NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF COURSE THE REAL BIG HITTERS OR THE INDEPENDENT BRAND PATRICK OPEN HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE IN MIDDLE EASTERN AFFAIRS ROBERT FISK
HOW MUCH MCRAE IN ECONOMICS EXPERT JUST IS UNPARALLELED SO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT WANTING REAL EXPERT ANALYSIS AND LET'S FACE IT NO ONE GETS NEWS ANY MORE FROM NEWSPAPERS THERE'S VOICES REALLY SHOULD BE RETAINED AND I'M SURE WE WILL DO THAT
WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT GARY'S HERE WITH THE SPORTS NEWS MY GUESS AND IT'S A GOOD WEEKEND AS WELL MICK THE ONE DAY CRICKET SERIES BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SOUTH AFRICA THAT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED TOMORROW AFTER SOUTH AFRICA BEATINGS AND BY ONE WICKET TO DRAW LEVEL AND ENGLAND'S WOMEN ALSO LOST TO SOUTH AFRICA WHAT ABOUT THE RUGBY WELL ENGLAND DON'T PLAY UNTIL TOMORROW TODAY THE FOCUS IS ON MY ISLAND WHO TRAVELLED TO FRANCE WHILE AS WE PREVIEWED EARLIER WALES MEET SCOTLAND LET'S HAVE A BIT MORE ON THE RUGBY WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT IAN ROBERTSON
AFTER LAST WEEK'S RESULTS THE TRIPLE CROWN IS ALREADY ELUDED WALES AND SCOTLAND BUT THERE'S EVERY CHANCE THESE TWO TEAMS WILL PRODUCE THE BEST MATCH AT THE WEEKEND IF SCOTLAND RECAPTURE THE WORLD CUP FORM WALES WILL NEED TO BE AT THEIR BEST TO WIN WITH THEN BIGGER FIT THE WELSH BACKS MAY JUST HAVE THE EDGE
IN PARIS FRANCE WILL NEED TO IMPROVE A COUPLE OF NOTCHES TO BEAT IRELAND THEIR NEW COACH HE NO VEZ NEEDS TIME TO BLEND HIS NEW SQUAD INTO A COHESIVE TEAM IRELAND DESPITE THE LONG INJURY LIST ARE CAPABLE OF WINNING AND GOING TOP OF THE SIX NATIONS STAPLE WALES AGAINST SCOTLAND IS LIVE ON B.B.C. RADIO AND TELEVISION THIS AFTERNOON IN THE PREMIERSHIP NEWCASTLE BEAT LEICESTER TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN WIGAN ARE TOP OF THE SUPER LEAGUE FOLLOWING AN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN VICTORY OVER HUDDERSFIELD
NOW IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE TOP FOUR SIDES ALL PLAY EACH OTHER TOMORROW THIS IN A WEEK WHEN THE PRICE OF TICKETS TO WATCH FOOTBALL HAS MADE HEADLINES ALL THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS AWASH WITH MONEY FURTHER DOWN MANY CLUBS STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY INDEED BRADFORD CITY HAVE A CROWD FUNDING SCHEME IN PLACE THE CLUB HAVE TEAMED UP WITH A SPECIALIST COMPANY TO A POSSE TO HELP WITH FINANCES AND FORMER CHELSEA MANAGER JEAN ARK LUKA THE ALI IS INVOLVED IN THE SCHEME I ASKED HIM IF LEADING CLUB SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO HELP SUPPORT US
I THINK THE GLOVES ARE RECEIVING ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE T.V. RIGHTS AND NOT TO HAVE TO RAISE THE
PRICE OF THE TICKETS I BELIEVED THAT THE PREMIERSHIP IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SELL THIS PRODUCT ABROAD YOU CAN THEY THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A FORTUNE
AND I BELIEVE THAT PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE FANGS THEY DESERVE CREDIT BECAUSE THEY COME TO EVERY MATCH THEY MAY
LOVELY NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND THE SOUNDTRACK IS FANTASTIC AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE ATTITUDE AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE FENCE SO I THINK FENCE
DESERVES EVERY WAR IT BECAUSE IF YOU SAID THIS PRODUCT ABROAD FOR SO MUCH GRANNY IS ALSO BECAUSE THE FANGS AND THIS WAY THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED WITH FOOTBALL CLUBS NOT RAISING THE PRICE OF THE TICKETS
IT'S BEEN A FASCINATING SEASON IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE BUT NOT FOR YOUR FORMER CLUB CHELSEA WHO YOU MANAGED WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'VE HAD SUCH A POOR SEASON I THINK THAT THEY HAVE HAD A FANTASTIC SEASON LASTS
DESERVEDLY WIN THE PREMIERSHIP I THINK THAT WHEN THEY CAME BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON THE MENACE TO RECHARGE THEIR BATTERIES
AND I THINK THAT GOING ALL OVER THE WORDS FOR FRIENDLY MATCHES DIDN'T HE
THERE WERE NORSE BUT MAJOR SANG IN THE SUMMER WHEN YOU WIN SOMETHING I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU TRY TO RE MOTIVATE THE PLAYERS SIGN IN A COUPLE OF
EXTENDING PLAYERS ARE COMING TO THE CLUB AND VERY MOTIVATED HE DIDN'T
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THE JAWS AND IT HANDLED THE SITUATION I MEAN I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH I THINK HE'S A FANTASTIC MANAGER BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE WAY HE SORT OF HANDLED THE SITUATION IS BEGINNING TO CAESAR WHEN HE BASICALLY HANG FOR A BIT
THE SAME WAY HE ALWAYS DOES IT WITHOUT CHEST THAT HEAD UP AND SORT OF BEING
VERY AGGRESSIVE IF YOU IF YOU LIKE WHEN I THINK OF THE PLACE AT THE TIME JUST WANTED AND NEEDED SOME PEACE AND QUIET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND YOU WORK EVEN HARDER AND YOU KEEP IT QUIET UNTIL YOU START WINNING AGAIN AND THAT I THINK DIDN'T HELP THE PLAYERS
YOU THINK SOME OF MARIE NEO'S PRESS CONFERENCES IN THE WAY HE BEHAVED UNSETTLED THE PLAYERS AND HE SHOULD HAVE BUT PERHAPS BEHAVED IN A MORE DIGNIFIED MANNER NO NO I CAN SAY THAT I JUST SAID THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN ME I WOULD HAVE JUST KEPT IT
KEPT A LOW PROFILE TRIED TO STAY UNDER THE RADAR IS SORT OF BEAM
IN YOUR FACE IF YOU LIKE AND JUST ALLOW THE PLAYERS
IN A WAY JUST RECOVER IN A QUIETER ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT TOO MANY CONTROL THIS IS TOO MANY SO OF STATEMENTS AND TOM TOO MUCH ATTENTION IF YOU LIKE DO YOU THINK HE WOULD BE A GOOD MANAGER FOR MANCHESTER UNITED IT'S SORT OF WIDELY THOUGHT THAT HE WILL END UP THERE AT THE START OF NEXT SEASON I'D BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK A GOOD CHOICE FOR MANCHESTER UNITED IF THEY DECIDE TO MAKE A CHANGE
I THINK MORE BROADLY JOSH CAN HELP ANY CLUBS WITH AMBITIONS TO WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS AT ALL EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP
YOU CAN BE THE MEN SO IF MANCHESTER UNITED I THINKING ABOUT I THINK YOU WOULD BE
A GOOD CHOICE JEAN LUCA THE ALI AND HIS CHELSEA SIDE PLAYED NEWCASTLE THIS EVENING FIVE LIFE FOR THEIR USUAL COMPREHENSIVE SURFACE OF ALL THE RESULTS AND COMMENTARIES RACING SELECTIONS RUN AT NEWBURY THREE O'CLOCK WE'VE SELECTED NUMBER ONE DODGING BULLETS HIS FIRST OUTING SINCE CHELTENHAM LAST YEAR EARLIER AT TEN MINUTES TO TWO IT'S NUMBER TWO ZERO SHADES OF GREY

WE HAVE A SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGIST CALLED THERE AND SWAMI WHO HAS BEEN EXAMINING AND LOOKING AT THE RULES OF HUMAN ATTRACTION FOR TEN YEARS AND THE EXPERT SOCIAL HISTORIAN RUTH GOODMAN ON HOW TO BE A TUDOR IT'S ALL COMING UP AFTER NIGHT NOT MISERABLE OF COURSE THANK YOU THAT LOOK AT THE WEATHER MOSTLY DRY WITH SOME SUNNY SPELLS WINTERY WINTERY OUTBREAKS IN PLACES YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH NICK ROBINSON AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S HALF PAST EIGHT LET'S HAVE ARE SOME OF THE NEWS CORRIE CORFIELD IS HERE
WASHINGTON HAS CALLED SYRIA'S PRESIDENT THE SHAH AND SAD DELUDED FOR SAYING HE INTENDS TO KEEP FIGHTING UNTIL HE REGAINS CONTROL OF THE COUNTRY WORLD POWERS ARE PUSHING PROPOSE IN HOSTILITIES TO BEGIN WITHIN SEVEN DAYS REBEL GROUPS HAVE SAID THEY WILL NOT GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS UNTIL RUSSIA STOPS BOMBING THEIR POSITIONS
DAVID CAMERON HAS TOLD BUSINESS LEADERS IN GERMANY BUT HE BELIEVES HE CAN SECURE THE REFORMS HE NEEDS TO WIN THE REFERENDUM TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE E.U. BUT HE SAID HE RULED NOTHING OUT IF HE DID NOT GET THE CHANGES HE WANTED
THE POPE AND THE HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH HAVE ISSUED A HISTORIC DECLARATION FOR CHRISTIANS TO BE PROTECTED FROM PERSECUTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST THEY MADE THE CALL AFTER HOLDING THEIR FIRST TALKS AFTER THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH SPLIT BETWEEN EAST AND WEST IN THE ELEVENTH CENTURY
THE REDS DEPEND SECRETARY INGE CARTER HAS SAID BRITAIN MUST KEEP ITS NUCLEAR SUBMARINE SIP IT WANTS TO CONTINUE PUNCHING ABOVE ITS WEIGHT ON THE WORLD STAGE
RESEARCHERS SAY FIVE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE DYING PREMATURELY EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION MORE THAN HALF THE DEATHS ARE SAID TO BE IN CHINA AND INDIA
THE TIME TWENTY NINE MINUTES TO NINE THE CEASEFIRE IN SYRIA IF IT HAPPENS WON'T STOP FOR A WEEK BUT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE TALKS IN MUNICH COULD MEAN THEY GET MUCH MORE AID INTO THE COUNTRY IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS
BUT AT WHAT COST AID AGENCIES HAVE ALREADY WARNED ABOUT AID BECOMING A BARGAINING CHIP WHAT DEALS THEY HAVE TO DO TO GET ACCESS TO THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE HAPPENING EVEN AS PRESIDENT ASSAD'S SAID HE INTENDS TO TAKE BACK THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY AID IS DESPERATELY NEEDED MORE INFORMATION IS EMERGING ALL THE TIME OR PEOPLE STARVING IN BESIEGED AREAS
ABDUL KARIM A SKY AS A SYRIAN DOCTOR WHO WORKS FOR SAVE THE CHILDREN HE'S BASED IN TURKEY ON THE BORDER BUT CROSSES INTO THE COUNTRY WHEN HE CAN AND HE TOLD ME EARLIER THAT ANY EASING IN THE FIGHTING WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE ONE OFF THE MAIN CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS OUR ABILITY TO REACH MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE FIRST THOUGHT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL PEOPLE IN NEED ESPECIALLY IN THE HOT AIR AND THE HARD LINES BECAUSE OF ACTIVE CONFLICTS
AND OUR ABILITY TO RE USED THE BESIEGED AREAS BECAUSE OF THIS ACTIVE CONFLICT SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THESE FIRES WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO REACH MORE PEOPLE
WELL WE'RE JOINED FROM BERLIN BY DAVID MILLIBAND WHO IS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE WILL SPEAK TO OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT SAID IN JUST A MOMENT DAVID MILLIBAND GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
THESE CEASEFIRES IF THEY HAPPEN HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE HEARD NOT LEAST FROM PRESIDENT A SAD SINCE THIS DEAL WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN OR THE WORD IF THEY HAPPEN IT MUST BE THE RIGHT ONE YOU USED IT AND I THINK IT'S THE WORD THAT WE WOULD USE AS WELL WE KNOW THAT IN THE WEEK SINCE THE LONDON CONFERENCE CONVENED AT LAST WEEK CAN BEEN BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT THE PROMISED MORE AID OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FLEE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE FIGHTING
WE'VE SEEN THESE FALSE DAWNS BEFORE AND OBVIOUSLY FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW MY ORGANISATION HAS TWO THOUSAND STAFF WORKING IN AND AROUND SYRIA WE'VE GOT ABOUT A MILLION SYRIANS INSIDE THE COUNTRY RELIANT ON US FOR HEALTH CARE OR WATER AND SANITATION ET-CETERA WE ARE EVERY DAY HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE TRIPLE THREAT NOT JUST ASAD SAD AT NOT JUST THE TERROR OF ISIS AND RELATED GROUPS BUT ALSO THE RUSSIAN BOMBINGS AS WELL
SO WHILE THE CEASEFIRE CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS BEFORE WE SAY IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE GROUND IN THE FACT THAT IT'S A WEEK BEFORE IT EVEN COMES IN YOU ARE YOU PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THAT WEEK IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO TAKE TERRITORY YES ABSOLUTELY IF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU WERE HAVING ON THIS PROGRAMME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE POLITICAL TALKS THE FEAR THEN WAS THAT THE PROSPECT OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE USED AS A COVER FOR MASS BOMBING THAT HAPPENED
AND AS I SAID YESTERDAY IF YOU IF YOU NEED AN EMERGENCY OPERATION YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD THAT YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT A WEEK AND SO IT IS ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THE UNITED NATIONS SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY CAN START TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT FRANKLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND IS THE SITUATION GETTING MUCH WORSE NOT MUCH BETTER WE'RE SEEING FEW INCENTIVES FOR THE ASSAD REGIME TO COMPROMISE THEY THINK THEY'RE ON THE UP YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM THE INTERVIEWS THAT PRESIDENT ASAD GAVE YESTERDAY
AND A REAL LACK OF DETAIL IN WHAT THIS AGREEMENT ACTUALLY MEANS EVEN BETWEEN SECRETARIES LOVER OFF AND CARRY THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE STATEMENT THEY MADE ON THURSDAY AND SO I AM HONOUR BOUND TO REPORT TO YOU THE SITUATION ON THEM
GROUND IS DIRE AND GETTING WORSE AND IN TRYING TO DELIVER AID AND DO THE JOB THAT YOUR STAFF ARE DOING IN SYRIA ARE THEY MAKING THESE SORT OF A DEAL'S DAILY I THERE WAS ONE THING IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS BUT SLIGHTLY JARRED WITH ME AND WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO DO QUOTE UNQUOTE DEALS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS LIVE WITH THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND ON THE GROUND AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO TALK TO ALL SIDES AND WE HAVE TO JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SAFE FOR OUR STAFF TO
INTO AN AREA TO STAY IN AN AREA TO KEEP A HEALTH CENTRE GOING ALL WEATHER AS WE HAD TWO IN LA TACKIER AT THIS WEEK WITH HER WE HAVE TO CLOSE THEM TEMPORARILY BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF BOMBING SO WE'RE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION TO MAKE DEALS WHAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO DO IS FIGURE OUT THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT OUR STAFF CAN SAFELY DELIVER THE AID BUT ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THAT THAT THAT ACCESS ALLOWING THAT ACCESS ALL THIS IS IS BECOMING A SORT OF
BARGAINING CHIP IN THE POLITICAL NEGOTIATION I THINK THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING AND BIGGER APPOINT MY OWN POINT OF VIEW IS THAT FOR FIVE YEARS THE POLITICAL TRACK AND THE HUMANITARIAN TRACK HAVE BEEN SEPARATED TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT THE FEAR OF THE POLITICISATION OF AID HAS COME FOR SPECIFIC REASONS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTH WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE ASSAD REGIME'S POSITION
AND WITH THE FACT THAT U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS THAT WERE PASSED OVER HER NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO NOW HAVE ACTUALLY NOT ACCOMPANIED AN INCREASE IN AID FLOWS ON THE GROUND THE FACT THAT THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL THREE TIMES CAN PASSED RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR AID TO BE DELIVERED AND THEN REPORT MONTHLY BUT THE ASSAD REGIME IS TAKING MEDICAL SUPPLIES OFF LORRIES THAT ARE GOING INTO SYRIA SHOWS YOU THAT A MOCKERY AS BEING MADE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM
I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO STAND UP FOR THE PRINCIPLE BUT AID HAS GOT TO BE DELIVERED ON INDEPENDENT BASIS TO CIVILIANS WERE IN DESPERATE NEED AND CAPER WOULD ACCEPT THOUGH THAT IF YOU GET AID IN THERE IS A RISK THAT IT WILL PROLONG THE FIGHTING BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT WILL END UP WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WILL FIGHT I DON'T REALLY BUY THAT I CAN I THINK THE OPPOSITE CASE WHICH IS THAT IMMIE'S ORATION OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY RADICALISE THEM IS EQUALLY STRONG FRANKLY EVERY TIME A BARREL BOMB GETS DROPPED IT
DRAINS HOPE AND I'VE MET PEOPLE HERE IN BERLIN REFUGEES WHO'VE ARRIVED FROM SYRIA FROM ALEPPO ACTUALLY WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK THEY'VE STILL GOT FAMILY IN ALEPPO AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE DESPERATE THE IDEA THAT IF THEY GOT SOME AID THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS WORSE I DON'T REALLY BUY AND THE THOSE WHO SAY LOOK WHAT YOU DO AT LEAST HAVE WITH THIS AGREEMENT IS YOU HAVE RUSSIA AND AMERICA AT LEAST BROADLY A GROWING SOMETHING AND COMMITTED POSSIBLY
IT'S ALL ABOUT COMMITMENT AND I'VE BEEN GIVEN NOT JUST THE JOB I DO NOW BUT THE JOB HAD DONE BEFORE IT MUST BE RIGHT THAT RUSSIA AND AMERICA AND FRANKLY IT NEEDS TO BE IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL IT MUST BE RIGHT BUT THOSE COUNTRIES ARE SITTING DOWN TOGETHER AND COMMITTING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THIS NOT JUST APPALLING HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE
BUT FRANKLY A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT IS CREATING INSTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND IN EUROPE IT MUST BE RIGHT BUT GREAT AND SERIOUS AND RESPONSIBLE POWERS SIT DOWN TO TRY AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY AGREE ON ANYTHING
DAVID MILLIBAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL AS I SAID IN MUNICH IS A CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT LISE DO SET AND ON THAT THEY HAD THIS SUPPOSE IT AGREEMENT AND THEN WE HAD PRESIDENT A SAD SAYING HE'S GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE WHOLE OF SYRIA DO WE KNOW WHAT THEIR REACTION TO THAT IS AND WHETHER THEY FEEL THAT THAT IS TOTALLY JEOPARDISE THE SEAS
WELL IT HASN'T JEOPARDISED THE CEASEFIRE BECAUSE THE CEASEFIRE HASN'T BEGUN THERE IS AS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING A WEEK AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN TERMINOLOGY SHE'S FAR AS PROPPING UP THE CORRECT WORD TO BE BE SPLITTING HAIRS BUT JOHN KERRY TALKED ABOUT WAS A PAW IN THE FIGHTING A TRUCE BECAUSE THIS WAS NEGOTIATED HERE IN MUNICH BY ALL THE OLD SCIPIO'S THERE WEREN'T SYRIANS THE TABLE PRESIDENT ASSAD'S PEOPLE WEREN'T AT THE TABLE THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR HIM SING
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN DAMASCUS AND I CAN SAY BEEN IN DAMASCUS IN DECEMBER AND SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND HIM THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT A MILITARY SOLUTION THEN THEY'RE VERY CONFIDENT BECAUSE OF RUSSIA'S NEW NEW BACKING I THINK MILIBAND SAID WE'VE GONE FROM DECLARATIONS FROM THE MAIN PARTIES TO ACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND THERE ARE NOW BUT THEY CALL TASK FORCES GROUPS OF PEOPLE
BOTH ON THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE END ON THIS SET THIS TRUCE THIS CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES BUT WE'LL BE LOOKING WILL BE WATCHING TO SEE WHO BREAKS THE COMMITMENTS EVENT YOU TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM IT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S GOING TO SUCCEED IT WILL STILL HAVE A LOT OF AND SCEPTICISM BUT AT LEAST NOW THERE IS A PROCESS THAT IS IS UNDER WAY I'M GAY BUT ARE THEY AGREED AND HOW THAT PROCESS WILL WORK BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE HEARING IS THAT THERE IS EFFECTIVELY A LOOPHOLE YOU CAN STILL RUSSIA CANCEL BOMB TERRACE IT JUST DEPENDS WHO YOU DEFINE AS A TERRORIST
THE BIGGEST LOOPHOLE THE GAPING HOLE IN ALL OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIANS GOT IN THAT MEETING OF SIX HOURS THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT TALKS THEY WERE ABLE TO TO TO COME AWAY WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BOMB BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY ARE BOMBING THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE
THE OLD KAI DILLINGER BUT HONEST SO IT IS THE BATTLE AGAINST AGAINST TERRORISM THAT BRITAIN IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHEN IN SIXTY COUNTRIES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM IS THIS ON THE GROUND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THAT SOMETIMES THE KIND OF FIGHTERS ARE WORKING WITH THE MODERATE FIGHTERS
THE FIGHTER SWITCH ALLEGIANCES WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY RAPIDITY RESOURCES GO BACK AND FORTH SO THEY'RE ALSO HITTING OTHER GROUPS BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM INSIDE THAT MEETING RUSSIA WAS WAS ADAMANT THEY SAID IF THE OTHERS GET IN THE WAY THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOT OURS THEY SHOULD BE LEAVING THOSE AREAS IN THE FACT WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME GROUPS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE OUTSIDE A GROUP BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BOMBED BY THE AMERICANS AND WHEN I ASKED THE U.N. ABOUT THIS THEY SAID
THERE WAS A LIST OF THE BESIEGED AREAS IN THE AREAS WHERE THERE WOULD BE A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN BRITAIN PUSH VERY HARD THAT A LEPER WOULD BE PART OF THAT TECHNICALLY SPEAKING A LEPER WAS NOT BESEECH BOTH SIDES USE WATER IN FOOD AS WEAPONS OF WAR BUT IT'S NOT THE KIND OF SEEDS THAT COD ABSOLUTE CUTTING UP OF ALL FOOD AND MEDICINE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN A ANOTHER FOURTEEN AREAS ACROSS SYRIA
TO RUSSIA ONE BIG ARGUMENT THAT IT WASN'T A BESIEGED AREA BUT THIS WAS ABOUT TERRORISM BUT IT IS WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE EVERYONE EXPECTS TO SEE THAT IN THE NEXT WEEK OR MORE RUSSIA WILL ACCELERATE IT THE ATTACKS OF ITS BOLSTERING AND TO GET ASAD'S HORSES IN EVEN STRONGER POSITION IN THE BIGGEST CITY PLEASE DESSERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

FINALLY SEVERAL PAPERS FEATURE A DOG WHOSE OWNER IS TAUGHT HIM TO READ THE EXPRESS'S PRIMARY SCHOOL HEAD TEACHER NICK GARDENER TRAIN THEIR TWO YEAR OLD CHOCOLATE LABRADOR FERNY TO RECOGNISE FOUR SEPARATE COMMANDS ON CARDS SIT
ROLL OVER DOWN AND SPIN THE MALES HAS MY GARDENER GAVE FERGIE FERNY I'M SORRY READING LESSONS AFTER TALKING TAKE HIM TO SCHOOL SO COULD SNUGGLE UP TO HIS PUPILS STORY TIME AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENJOY THE BOOKS HE SAYS THE DOG HAS INSPIRED PUPILS TO READ TELLING THE MIRROR IF THEY CAN SEE THE DOG COULD READ SURELY THEY CAN DO IT TOO IT IS A HUGE MOTIVATION WHY DOES THE DONKEY TO LEARN THE WORDS
HA HA I'LL BE MAYBE SHALL WE CAN FIND THIS OUT OF HIS FUTURE IN POLITICS HERE VERY CURIOUS YES TELL US ABOUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DOG CAN DO THE SAME THING NOW IT IS SIXTEEN MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK WE'LL ALL SUPERMARKET SOON BE SAYING BOG OFF TO BOG OFF THAT'S THE PHRASE OF COURSE FOR A BUY ONE GET ONE FREE THE DEALS WHICH SO MANY OF US FOR SO LONG HER FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO RESIST SAINSBURY SET THAT CHANGES IN THE WAY WE SHOP AND CONCERNED ABOUT WASTE HAVE CONVINCED THEM OF THE NEED TO DO AWAY WITH THESE MULTI BUY DEALS THEM MIGHT JUST A BIT AWARE TOO THAT THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG IS ABOUT TO ISSUE GUIDANCE TO RETAILERS
TO NOT MISLEAD SHOPPERS ABOUT PRICE WHAT WE JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY REGGIE CAMPBELL WHO'S A CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGIST AT THE BUSINESS CONSULTANCY CAMPBELL KEEGAN AND ALSO BY TERESA WE CAN RETAIL CONSULTANT AND A FORMER DIRECTOR AT THE SUPERMARKET SAFEWAY ROSIE FIRST OF ALL IF WE WOULD LET'S GET INTO OUR PSYCHE LET'S GET INTO OUR MIND MANY IF THIS DEED FRIGHTENED THESE SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE THESE SORTS OF DEALS
WHY AND WHAT'S CHANGED SO I THINK IT WAS I WOULD SAY THAT THE HEYDAY OF THE BOG OFF WAS PROBABLY THE KIND OF NINETIES PERHAPS EARLY INTO THE TWO THOUSANDS IN A FUNNY WAY I THINK IT WAS ALMOST A LEGACY OF THE KIND OF THATCHERITE YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING THINGS FOR YOURSELF AND PULLING THINGS TO YOURSELF AND WANTING TO BUILD UP KNOW STOCKS OF THINGS AND I THINK
NONE OF US COULD RESIST THAT BECAUSE IT JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE WINNING WE WERE PLAYING A SORT OF GAME SO IT BECAME QUITE A KIND OF ALMOST LIKE A SORT OF A THROWING A DICE IN THE SUPERMARKET SO WE SORT OF BEATING THE CHAIN AT ITS EFFORTS TO YOU KNOW TO PRICES AND SO ON WE WERE MUGS OF COURSE COS THE SUPERMARKETS WERE PLAYING AS WEREN'T THEY WE THOUGHT WE WERE BEATING THERE BUT GETTING MORE FUN I THINK THERE'S A DEGREE OF THAT AND I ALSO FEEL THAT I KNOW THERE'S THAT THE COMPETITION WATCHDOG AND ALL OF THESE THINGS PUTTING
PRESSURE ON ON THE RETAILERS ON SAINSBURY REALLY ARE THE FIRST TO COME OUT HERE BUT IT FITS TOTALLY WITH THE KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ZEIT GAZED FOR CONSUMERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE NEW TAKE ON KIND OF BEING ECONOMICAL IS AUSTERITY IT'S FRUGALITY IT'S KIND OF AVOID WASTE WHERE YOU CAN WE HAVE PROGRAMMES ON THE T.V. ABOUT DE CLUTTERING YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR WARDROBE SO I THINK THAT ALL FEEDS INTO THIS IDEA THAT ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO LIVE MORE SIMPLY I MEAN EVEN AT THE FAR END
TERESA HE DID WORK FOR RETAILERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME DIDN'T IT THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD SHIFT MORE PRODUCE QUICKER BY TELLING PEOPLE THEY GOT A GOOD DEAL EVEN FRANKIE WHEN THEY WERE GETTING SUCH GREAT WELL YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I THINK THAT THE RETAILERS HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE PREFER AN EVERY DAY LOW PRICE AND IN FACT ASDA WENT FOR EVERY DAY LOW PRICE OR NOT
REALLY FOR PROMOTION TO THOUSANDS AND WHY BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BECAUSE THE PHONE WELL IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY'D PREFER EVERY DAY LOW PRICE INTERESTING ENOUGH IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RESEARCH BY THE I.G. DEES SAID FIFTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT PROMOTIONS THEY WANTED EVERY DAY LOW PRICE SO I THINK PEOPLE HAVE WOKEN UP TO THAT FACT BUT AS FAR AS SUPERMARKETS HAVE CONCERNED THE COMPETITION
AND THE WITCH INQUIRY HAS FOCUSED THE MIND ON THE FACT THEY'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT WE'VE GOT MORE PROMOTIONS NOW THE FORTY PERCENT OF PRODUCTS IN SUPERMARKETS ARE ON SOME FORM OF PIPES PROMOTION MAYBE THAT BOG OFF AS IT WERE MULTI BUY DEALS A GAME OTHER SORTS OF PROBATION THERE'S ALWAYS BECAUSE WE'VE SOME TROUT AND OUR PROBLEM IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE PSYCHE UNLESS YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO REALLY DOES THE WORK APPEARS BELOW THE LABEL SAYS IS SEVEN P. PER HUNDRED GRAMS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
WE VERY EASILY TEMPTED BY THIS THAT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THE THING ABOUT THE SORT OF EVERYDAY LOW PRICE HAS BEEN ALSO KIND OF HERALDED BY THE ELDERS AND LITTLE SWISS WELL AND LITTLE OF THIS WORLD SO WE'VE GOT A KIND OF NEW BENCHMARKS I THINK THEY'RE ALL THESE SORT OF CULTURAL DISCOURSES RUNNING THROUGH THE BACK OF ONE'S MIND WHEN YOU SHOP EVEN AT A VERY KIND OF FLEETING WAVE BECAUSE WE DON'T SHOCK RATIONALLY AND THINKING HARD AND MEASURING PRICES WE DO ACTUALLY MAKE MOST OF THE
BIG DECISIONS AND THE SMALL DECISIONS ENTIRELY EMOTIONALLY SO I GUESS WE JUST WANT TO SEE SOMETHING WE FEEL WE'VE DONE WELL ACT SO I THINK IT'S HOW TO SHOP
SO WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK OUT FOR IN THE FUTURE TERESA WHAT SORT OF DEALS WITH A B. I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WHERE WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THINGS REMEMBERED LIKE TOMORROW'S VALENTINE'S DAY SO WE CAN BUY A MEAL FOR TWO FOR TEN POUNDS THAT SORT OF THING PROTEIN TEN AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK WHAT THE BIG CHANGE IS GOING TO BE
IS THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH CLEARER AND IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE THAT AND THE OLDIES AND IT'LL HAVE GONE BACK TO THE OLD FASHION RETAILING OF HAVING A LEAFLET OR A BOOKLET EVERY WEEK TELLING YOU WHAT THE SPECIAL OFFERS ARE THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS BOG OFFS AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THAT AND THEN THEY BASE THEIR SHOPPING ON THAT WHETHER THEY ARE GOING ONLINE OR THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING INTO THE STORES THE WEASEL CHANGE ROSE YOU IF INCOME START TO GO UP AND WE WERE TAUGHT IN THE SQUEEZE THEY'VE BEEN ON INCOMES
WILL OUR WILLINGNESS AS IT WERE TO STOP LOOKING SO CAREFULLY A PRICE GO AND WILL STILL HAVE TO SOME EXTENT I MEAN YOU SHOULD SAY THAT PERHAPS THAT PART OF THE MARKET IS BEING FED AND FUELLED BY THE GROWTH OF THIS SORT OF GOING TO LITTLE INDEPENDENT STORES THE FARMERS' MARKET ON SUNDAY THE KIND OF GOING SHOPPING ON A BIKE WITH A BASKET ON YOUR ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BIKE AND KIND OF PICKING AND CHOOSING
IT'S ALL ABOUT FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND SEEING YOURSELF AS SOMEBODY WHO A CAREFUL SHOPPER SO MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE NEW ZEITGEISTY HOW I'M DOING MY SHOPPING CLEVERLY VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD THERESA THE PROBLEM WITH BUY ONE GET ONE FREE QUITE QUICKLY PEOPLE REALISED THAT THEY WERE OFTEN BINNING THE WALL THEY GOT FREE YES WASTE HAS BEEN A BIG THING BUT I THINK THE BIG CHANGES BEEN ONLINE SHOPPING THAT'S GIVEN US THE YOU KNOW THE EXODUS TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TERESA WE CAN ROSIE COME THANK YOU BOTH FOR AN ENTRY
THE TIME IS NOW TEN MINUTES TO NINE LEICESTER CITY TRAVEL TO ARSENAL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TOMORROW IT'S THE LATEST TEST IN AN AMAZING ROUND THAT'S LEFT THE SIDE FIVE POINTS CLEAR AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE AND THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED BECAUSE THEIR RELATIVE MINNOWS IN THE MODERN ERA OF BIG MONEY IT IS SO UNUSUAL THAT SOME ARE ATTRIBUTING IT TO THE SUPERNATURAL
THEIR RUN OF FORM COINCIDES WITH THE REBURIAL OF RICHARD THE THIRD DID LEICESTER CATHEDRAL NOW IT'S THAT WENT OUT OF OUR DISCONTENT MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THIS SUN OF YORK LAURENCE OLIVIER THEY'RE PLAYING RICHARD THE THIRD IN THE FAMOUS NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FILM BUT WHAT IF THE KING'S GHOST REALLY WERE THERE TO WITNESS THE GULLS HAVE JAMES JAMIE VODDY WHEELS THE ACTOR MICHAEL SHEEN TO IMAGINE IT
THAT THE BUDDIES IN THE BOX IT'S JAMIE
IF I DID CUT THE PEAR IT'S A GOAL YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE FROM A TEAM THAT'S GONNA WIN THE LEAGUE
WATCH IT AGAIN WATCH IT AGAIN AND WATCH IT
HE'S OUT MATE JAPS THE LIVERPOOL PLAYERS CANNOT BUT LEAVE IT JAMIE VARTY THE GOAL OF YOUR LIFE LEICESTER ONE LIVERPOOL
MICHAEL SEEN PLAYING LAURENCE OLIVIER PLAYING RICHARD THE THIRD AND THE COMMENTARY WAS ORIGINALLY FROM YESTERDAY AND STRINGER MAKES WE WILL INVITE SOMEONE TO PLAY MICHAEL SHEEN PLAYED WITH THEIR PLATE JUST GO WHAT IF WE DID EVERY WEEK I COULDN'T WAIT WHO NEEDS THE PROGRAMME IT IS EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE O'CLOCK LET'S MOVE ON TO PHYSICS NOW WE KNOW EINSTEIN WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AS WELL AS ABOUT SO MUCH OUT OF COURSE BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER BIG
OLD SCIENTIFIC THEORIES WHICH ARE SIMPLY WAITING TO BE PROVEN WHAT IS THE NEXT BIG THING WHICH WILL EXCITE AS THE WOMAN INTO THIS HELEN CHAIR EXCUSE A PHYSICIST AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON
IS THERE A LIST OUT AND THE WAY THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WAS CLEARLY KNOWN BY PHYSICISTS IF THEY'RE PEOPLE SAYING WE'VE STILL GOT TO PROVE THAT SWAN
THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS TO DISCOVER IN SCIENCE BUT THE WERE SORT OF THERE AREN'T SO MANY BIG THEORIES THAT COVER EVERYTHING THE GREAT THING ABOUT RELATIVITY IS IT'S ABOUT THE NATURE OF TIME AND SPACE IS ALL AROUND US IT'S EVERYWHERE AND SO THERE ARE STILL THINGS WE WANT TO KNOW WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT DARK MATTER IS WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT DARK ENERGY IS WHY THERE'S MORE MATTER AND ANTI MATTER AND THEN THERE'S ALSO LOTS OF OTHER
QUESTIONS LIKE HOW THE BRAIN WORKS AND WHETHER WE CAN MAKE A QUANTUM COMPUTER WORK BUT WE'RE GETTING SERIOUS IS THE POINT WHERE THESE BIG VERY ELEGANT SERIES THAT COVER EVERYTHING
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY MORE THAN BESIDES IT'S JUST MORE COMPLICATED NOW SO WE HAVEN'T GOT THE ELEGANCE AND THAT WAS THE THING ABOUT THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES IT WAS SO ELEGANT SHE DO YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEW THINGS BUT JUST BRIEFLY ON THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES THERE MAY BE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL FREE I STILL DON'T QUITE GET THE SIGNIFICANCE YES VERY EXCITING EINSTEIN SAID IT AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE BUT SORT OF SO WHAT
THERE ARE TWO THERE ARE TWO SO WHAT'S THE FIRST ONE IS THAT SCIENTIFIC THEORIES HAVE TO MAKE PREDICTIONS AND THOSE PREDICTIONS CAN BE TESTED AND SO THIS WAS A TEST IT WAS EXPECTED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO WE'VE ONLY JUST SEEN IT AND IT IS A BEAUTIFUL TESTED THE THEORY AS A AND SAYINGS CORRECT THE SECOND BIT IS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE
FOR ALMOST ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY THE ONLY REASON WE KNOW THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE IS THAT IS THAT LIGHT ARRIVES AT US FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE THE ONLY REASON WE SEE THE STARS AND THE PLANETS AND THE SUN
I WAS HAVING A COUPLE OF DECADES GOING CAME ALONG AND NOW WE'VE GOT GEMMA RELA GRAVITATIONAL WAVES A NEW WAY OF TOUCHING THE INNER LET'S LET'S JUST START I'M AFRAID WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO START ON YOUR SHOPPING LIST OF OTHER EXCITING THINGS DARK MATTER WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR
WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTICLE THE WHEN WE LOOK OUT AT THE UNIVERSE WE CAN SEE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S MORE STUFF THAT WE CAN'T SEE AND THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT THERE IS FOR WHAT THAT STUFF MIGHT BE AN SAS DETECTORS DOWN MINES IN VARIOUS OTHER PLACES LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD FILL THAT GAP SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTICLE PROBABLY FOR DARK MATTER DARK ENERGY
OH DA DARK ENERGY IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING IT SEEMS THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS DARK ENERGY IS A KIND OF UMBRELLA TERM SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A THEORY ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND THEN MAYBE SOME WAY OF DETECTING IT BUT THAT'S A BIT FURTHER THIS IS A TEST CAN YOU DO THE WHOLE OF SCIENCE I THINK IT'S THAT ONE TO ME O.K. BEAUTY
SO QUANTUM COMPUTING IS IS A PRACTICAL AND ENGINEERING QUESTION ACTUALLY IT'S NOT AS MUCH ABOUT THEIR THEORIES IT'S ABOUT CAN WE TAKE THIS NEW IDEA A NEW WAY OF SOLVING COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS AND ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK AND A USEFUL WAY FOR US NOW YOU'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE SECONDS TO TELL US HOW WILL WORK OUT THE BRAID WORKS COS THAT WAS A WELL WHICH IS A TEST OF HOW YOUR BRAIN THE BRAIN IS THE MOST COMPLICATED THING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT WE KNOW OF AND YOU'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT CONSCIOUSNESSES AND THAT'S A MESSY PROBLEM IT'S NOT ABOUT AN ELEGANT SOLUTION
IT'S ABOUT A NEW TYPE OF SCIENCE WHICH IS LOTS OF DATA LOTS OF INTERACTING FACTORS AND IT'S GOING TO BE MESSY SORRY NO ELEGANCE SO MESSY FINALLY IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKING SMALL PROGRESS ON VITAL MATTERS RATHER THAN HEY PRESTO RATHER NEUTRALISED EINSTEIN MOMENT SO THE JIGSAW PIECES WILL STILL BE ELEGANCE BUT THE OVERALL THING IS GOING TO BE MORE ABOUT HOW THE JIGSAW PIECES SLOT TO GO BUT HE DID A VERY ELEGANTLY FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TOUCH I THANK YOU FOR THAT HELEN CHAIR SKI FROM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE ON BRAVO FOUR MINUTES TONIGHT
IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE HARRY BECK PUBLISHED HIS MAP OF THE TUBE YOU KNOW THE ONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE TRAVELLED ON THE TUBE TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME A DESIGN CLASSIC SO SUCCESSFUL IT'S NOT ONLY STILL IN USE TODAY THAT'S BEEN COPIED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND OF COURSE WHAT HE REALISED WAS THAT WHEN YOU'RE UNDERGROUND YOU DON'T NEED YOUR MAP TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY ACCURATE HE JUST NEEDED TO BE CLEAR PARTICULARLY ABOUT CONNECTIONS THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY MORE LINES ADDED IN THE DECADE SINCE THAT CLARITY
IS UNDER THREAT JOHN ENERGY IS THE EDITOR OF CITY METRIC NEW STATEMENTS STATESMAN SISTER PUBLICATION THAT FOCUSES ON CITY PLANNING AND DESIGN AND HE'S HERE IN THE STUDIO NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND IT'S NOT ONLY UNDER THREAT NOW BUT WE KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A WHOLE LOAD MORE LINES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DUMPED ON THIS MAP YES I MEAN THERE'S KIND OF BEEN A STATEMENT OF INTENT FROM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE LONDON CITY AUTHORITIES BUT ULTIMATELY TRANSPORT FOR LONDON SHOULD BE RUNNING THE VAST MAJORITY OF SUBURBAN RAIL LINES IN IN LONDON
NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING AT THE SAME SORT OF LINE FREQUENCY IS THE CENTRAL LINE IT'S GONNA BE SOME PRETTY RUBBISH RAIL SERVICES ON THERE AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A VERSION OF THE CHEAP MAP LET'S BOTH UGLY AND DOESN'T REALLY REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE QUALITY MARKET SERVICES SO
WOULD YOU QUESTION WHETHER THE MAP WE'RE USING NOW IS STILL FIT FOR PURPOSE WHETHER ACTUALLY WE NEED TO SAY THANK YOU HARRY BECK BUT WE'RE GOING TO START AGAIN I THINK THE THE DANGER IS IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M ATTACKING HARRY BECK THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT HARRY BECK WAS WRONG IT'S THAT TEAR FELL HAS KINDA LOST SIGHT OF HIS DESIGN PRINCIPLES THE ORIGINAL MAP IS A IS A THING OF BEAUTY IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND IS IT IS CUT IN A NICE DESIGN
THE CURRENT VERSION APART FROM ANY PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IT'S JUST UGLY AS SIN IT'S JUST LIKE THE PIG USES THESE TWO TONES OF GREY TO SHOW THE FARES OWNS IN THE BACKGROUND HE LOOKS LIKE IT'S ON BASED ON A CORPORATE ARTWORK FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IS JUST NOT AN ATTRACTIVE OBJECT
ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOW LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT ROUTES SHOWN IN THE SAME COLOUR OF OVERGROUND ORANGE AND IT'S JUST YOU CAN NO LONGER LOOK AT IT AND INSTANTLY SEE WHERE YOU NEED TO GO THERE BUT HAVE ARGUABLY WE'VE BEEN SPOILT HE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB AND WE LIKED IT WE LOVED IT BUT NOW THE REALITY IS IF YOU NEED A MAP AND IT'S A POINT TO THE MAP WHICH IS TO GUIDE YOU ROUND IT IT WON'T BE A THING OF BEAUTY
I I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF BECKS PRINCIPLES ARE EASIER TO APPLY ON THE SIMPLE NETWORK I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS HE DID REALISE WAS THAT
YOU CAN USE JUST TO STATIONS TO BE EVENLY SPACED SO HE KIND OF BLEW UP THE CENTRE OF TOWN AND FOR THE SHRUNK THE SUBURBS THAT ONLY REALLY WORKS WHEN YOU'VE GOT WHAT'S KNOWN AS A RADIO NETWORK WHEN MOST OF THE LINES CAN GOING OUT INCREASINGLY WE'VE GOT AN ORBITAL NETWORK AS WELL WHERE THE LINES ARE THE POOTLE THEIR WAY ROUND THE SUBURBS THAT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER TO KIND OF COME UP WITH THAT NICE PRETTY EVENLY SPACED DESIGN HARDER BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE I MEAN IS IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO APPLY HIS PRINCIPLES
POSSIBLY START AGAIN BUT YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR AND NICE TO LOOK AT IS COMPLETELY POSSIBLE DESIGNERS DO IT ALL THE TIME IT'S KIND OF BECOME A DESIGN CHALLENGE SO I.T. WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN HAD WATERGATE I'M THE GUY PEOPLE SEND THEIR ALTERNATIVE CHEAP UPTAKE OF GO ON HOW MANY YOU GET ABOUT ONE A WEEK AT THE MOMENT BUT MANY GOOD MANY OF THE WONDERFUL AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THE DESIGN BY PEOPLE HE DON'T EVEN LIVE IN LONDON WE'VE GOT A GUY IN HONG KONG WE'VE GOT ANOTHER GUY'S A SERBIAN GUY IN PARIS
AND THEY SEE IT IS KIND OF A CHALLENGE TO TAKE ON THIS ICONIC PIECE OF CITY DESIGN AND REDO IT AND ONE IMAGINES THAT HERE FELLA QUITE BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS HERE WERE ACTUALLY WITH A FINAL TEN SECONDS WE SHOULD PUT THE CALLER KEEP SENDING THEM TO YOU ABSOLUTELY IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO DO OF A MORNING YOUR VOCATION IS SET JOHN L. EJ THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEND THEM TO ARSENAL WILL PUT THEM ON TWITTER OR FACEBOOK OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT THAT'S ALL FROM OUTER EDITOR TIM DEFERMENT AND ADAM COME ESKY GOOD MORNING
