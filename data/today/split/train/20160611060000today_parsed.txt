I DON'T KNOW WHAT NATIONALITY THEY ARE BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE FROM MA SO IT'S
YOU'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH A FENCE FOR A BIT YOU'RE ONE OF THE FANS HERE FOR THE DAY

SOME OF THEM ARE UNEDUCATED THIS IS ALL THEY'VE GOT THEY COME OUT OF HIS ENGLAND GAMES THEY GET VERY DRUNK HE WAS STILL THAT THAT HOOLIGANISM IS ACTUALLY IT'S GONE THAT'S IN THE PAST OF COURSE IF THESE DRUNKEN IDIOTS THEY HAVEN'T GOT MUCH EDUCATION DAY STARTED
BY A BUNCH OF CULTURES FROM MARSEILLES AS WELL THEN OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO GO OFF WE'RE GOING TO TARGET ENGLAND FANS
IT IS TRUE TO SAY THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OF COURSE ARE BEHAVING THEMSELVES
THERE IS THIS MY MINORITY THAT HE'S CREATED A VERY TENSE ATMOSPHERE IN PARTS OF THE CITY
A LOT OF THE RESTAURANTS AND CAFES CLOSED EARLY
HERE GOES JUST CATCHING IN THE THROAT THAT HAS A REAL STRANGE MIX IN MARSEILLES AT THE MOMENT FRENCH FOOTBALL FANS CELEBRATING THEIR VICTORY OVER ROMANIA IN THE OPENING GAME OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
ENGLAND FOOTBALL FANS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME AND THEN JUST POCKETS OF THIS TENSION ALL OVER
THE CENTRE AROUND THE OLD PORT
THAT WAS MATTHEW IN MARSEILLES WE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM HIM LATER ON THE PROGRAMME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AND THIRTEEN OF BRITAIN'S LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE WARNED THAT IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'LL PUT AT RISK RESEARCH FUNDING AND A FEW OTHER WARNINGS AS WELL OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER CHRIS MASON'S A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT WHAT ELSE CHRIS YES THESE ARE THIRTY NOBEL LAUREATES JOHN SAYING THIS MORNING THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF COMING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR
THE LOSS OF Y. YOU RESEARCH FUNDING THEY SAY THEY DON'T BUY THE IDEA FROM LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS AT THE FUNDING SHORTFALL COULD BE MADE UP BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT OF US COMING OUT SAYING THAT THAT IS NAIVE AND COMPLACENT GIVEN THAT SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALLOWED THE U.K. TO LANGUISH WELL BELOW INTERNATIONAL AVERAGES IN RESEARCH INVESTMENT AND THEY SAY THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THERE IS A PERMEABILITY OF IDEAS AND PEOPLE BUT THE RESPONSE AS A SAFE FROM
VOTE LEAVE IS TO SAY LOOK IT IS A MYTH TO SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A BRUSSELS MONEY TREE AND THAT ULTIMATELY THIS IS U.K. MONEY THAT IS PACKAGED UP SENT TO BRUSSELS AND THEN AND THEN RETURNS BUT THE PROP FROM THE THE OTHER SIDE'S JAMES DYSON JAMES DYSON HE SAYS WARNINGS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A BRECK'S HE'D VOTE ON TRADERS WHO'D LOVELY PHRASE ABSOLUTE COBBLERS
TERRIFIC TRY IT IS VERY CRITICAL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SINGLE MARKET RECKONING THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A SINGLE MARKET AT ALL IT'S SAYS LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO AS AN EXPORT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS AND LANGUAGES ON THE SIDE OF YOUR THE STUFF THAT YOU'RE SELLING THE PLUGS ARE DIFFERENT THE LAWS ARE DIFFERENT IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS
CONSISTENT IN THE SINGLE MARKET IS THAT THERE ISN'T A TARIFF BUT BY THE TIME YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE POUND FLUCTUATING AGAINST THE EURO THAT'S PERFORM UP FAR MORE DAMAGING THAN ANY TARIFFS CRITICAL TO ABOUT IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS AS IT'S VERY HARD TO HIRE
FOREIGN ENGINEERS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE E.U. AND IT TAKES FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS TO GO THROUGH HOME OFFICE PROCEDURE AND HE SAYS THAT'S CRAZY EFFECTIVELY HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF CONTROL BY STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THE ING CAMPAIGN REACTS BY POINTING OUT THAT SIR JAMES DYSON DID ONCE SAY THAT WE SHOULD JOIN THE EURO IN THEY WOULD BE SUICIDAL FOR US NOT TO
BUT HE WAS WRONG THEN AND IN THEIR VIEW IS WRONG NOW WHAT ARE WE SHOULD MAKE OF THE LATEST POLLING BOOTH SEEMS TO SUGGEST SOME OF IT ANYWAY LEAVE ARE MILES AHEAD NOW YEAH AS EVER WE SHOULD IN A MASSIVE CAVEAT SHOULDN'T BE WITH OPINION POLLS NOT LEAST WITH OPINION POLLS THAT JOURNALISTS LIKE YOU AND ME MIGHT FIND INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT TEND TO BE THE THE OUT LIARS NONE THE LESS THERE IS THIS ONE THE SURVEY BY A WILD BEE FOR THE INDEPENDENT PUTTING LEAVES ON FIFTY FIVE
IN ON FORTY FIVE NOW THERE'S BEEN ONE OR TWO POLES VAGUELY IN THAT DIRECTION OVER THERE
SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN MONTHS THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF POLES HAVE HAD REMAIN IN FRONT EVEN LEAVE A TALKING DOWN THIS LATEST POLL SUGGESTING IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE FIFTY FIFTY AND FIFTY FIVE FORTY FIVE WHAT BOTH SIDES RECOGNISES THERE'S A VAST AMOUNT AT STAKE EVERYTHING TO PLAY FOR AND LEAVE EVER SINCE THOSE IMMIGRATION NUMBERS CAME OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I REALLY FELT LIKE THEY'VE HAD THE WIND IN THEIR SAILS THANKS CHRIS
THE TIME IS IT QUARTER PAST SEVEN THERE'S TO BE A TWO YEAR INVESTIGATION OF WHAT SOME ARE CALLING A GAME CHANGER IN THE EFFORT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF H.I.V. PREVENTION TREATMENT KNOWN AS PREP THIS IS WHAT THE HEALTH MINISTER JEN ELLISON SAID IN PARLIAMENT THIS WEEK THERE IS A WIDER PIECE OF WORK TO BE DONE AT WHICH THE PILOT PROGRAMME WE'VE ANNOUNCED
HIS PART TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHERE PREP FITS IN IN TERMS OF CLINICAL AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE H.I.V. PREVENTION LANDSCAPE MORE BROADLY ALONGSIDE ANOTHER WRECK OTHER
OTHER H.I.V. INTERVENTIONS THAT A COMMISSION SO THERE IS WORK YET TO DO WELL NOT EVERYONE IMPRESSED BY THAT IN FACT CAMPAIGNERS FOR PRAT VERY UNIMPRESSED DEBORAH GOULD IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE NATIONAL AIDS TRUST AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU WHAT TEST WELL WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES IT DO AND HOW DO YOU TAKE PREP IS A DRUG THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE H.I.V. NEGATIVE CAN TAKE TO STOP THEM FROM BECOMING INFECTED IN H.I.V. AND IT'S A PILL THAT YOU TAKE ONCE A DAY
OUR COUPLE HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT MAINLY YOU WOULD TAKE IT EVER FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE HAVING SEX IN THEM FOR TWO DAYS AFTER AND WHO DO YOU THINK OUGHT TO BE TAKING PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING INFECTED WITH H.I.V. IT'S NOT SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY BUT IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT AS YOU SAY KIND OF GAME CHANGING INTERVENTION THAT COULD START TO TURN THE TIDE
ON THE H.I.V. EPIDEMIC IN THE U.K. AND WE KNOW IT'S EFFECTIVE DO WE KNOW IT'S INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE THERE WERE THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF TRIALS AROUND THE WORLD BUT IN THE U.K. THERE WAS A TRIAL CALLED THE PROUD TRIAL WHICH ANSWERED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT JANE ELLISON IN PARLIAMENT IS HE'S SAYING NOW THIS IS A SMOKESCREEN YOU DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS A TWO YEAR PERIOD THAT YOU COULD LEGITIMATELY SAY WE NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHETHER WHAT NOT AT ALL AND
THE KIND OF HISTORY OF THIS IS THAT ACTUALLY THE N.H.S. WAS ON THE CUSP OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT COMMISSIONING THIS IN ADVANCE ARE DOING THAT THEY'D DONE A LOT OF THAT WORK THAT JANE ELLISON IT NOW SAY NEEDS TO BE DONE SO A GROUP OF N.H.S. STAFF CLINICIANS EXPERTS HAD GOT TOGETHER TO PUT A PROPOSAL TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS EVIDENCE BUT THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE
THEIR ADVICE TOLD THEM THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO COMMISSION PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND SO PREPPED WAS PULLED FROM THE COMMISSIONING PROCESS BUT WE'RE NOW LEFT IN THIS PROBLEM THEY THOUGHT YOU SAYS RISE AND IT CAN STOP PEOPLE GETTING H.I.V. AT THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY MAD ON ANY GROUNDS AND INCLUDING COST GROUNDS ACTUALLY LONG TERM ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THE EVIDENCE THAT ALREADY EXISTS THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE N.H.S. THAT IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND EVEN COST SAVING
IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS WHY WE AREN'T REALLY CLEAR WHY JANE ELLISON HAS ASKED FOR THIS NICE EVIDENCE REVIEW ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S GOING TO LOOK AGAIN AT EVIDENCE THAT ALREADY EXISTS ON THE OTHER HAND I SUPPOSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL THE N.H.S. YES VERY HARD PRESSED WHY SHOULD THEY BE HANDING OUT PILLS TO PEOPLE WHO COULD ALSO STOP THEMSELVES GETTING H.I.V. BY HAVING SAFER SEX UP THERE THERE ARE A RANGE OF REALLY GOOD REASONS FOR THAT AND THE FIRST IS IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO
TO HELP PEOPLE TO STOP THEMSELVES FROM GETTING AN INFECTION THAT WILL LAST FOR A LIFETIME AND HAVE ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THEM BUT ALSO IT'S COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE N.H.S. IT COULD BE COST SAVING FOR THE N.H.S. AND IT HAS MASSIVE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS
BECAUSE OVER TIME IF WE CAN START TO TURN THE TIDE ON THIS EPIDEMIC WE CAN END SOMETHING THAT HAS AN ENORMOUSLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE H.I.V. BUT ALSO IS A PUBLIC HEALTH COST AND RISK FOR THE COUNTRY WHATEVER THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US WE DID ASK TO SPEAK TO AN H. S. ENGLAND BUT NO ONE CAN TALK
THAT OUT THERE TWENTY PAST SEVEN THERE WERE ANGRY EXCHANGES IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS YESTERDAY WHEN MINISTERS RESISTED A BILL TO EXTRACT COMPENSATION FROM LIBYA FOR THE VICTIMS OF WEAPONS SUPPLIED TO THE I.R.A. BY COLONEL GADAFFI A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT MARK DOES WHO REPORTS
OVER THE YEARS OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND TROUBLES THE LIBYAN REGIME OF COLONEL GADDAFI SENT SHIPLOAD AFTER SHIPLOAD OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES TO THE I.R.A. FOR USE AGAINST BRITAIN YESTERDAY IN THE LORDS THE ULSTER UNIONIST PEER LORD M. P. PROPOSED A BILL TO ALLOW THE VICTIMS OF THE RESULTING TERRORIST ATTACKS TO CLAIM COMPENSATION AGAINST LIBYAN ASSETS FROZEN IN THIS COUNTRY
I SUBMIT THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LIVIA FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES UNTIL THE NINETEEN NINETIES
WAS I CLEAR ATTACK ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THAT LIBYA WAS PROSECUTING A WAR BY PROXY ON THE BRITISH PEOPLE
IN RETROSPECT I FIND A CHILLING THAT WITH THE WIDESPREAD INTELLIGENCE THAT WE NOW KNOW WAS AVAILABLE TO OUR GOVERNMENT
OF LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPLYING WEAPONS TO THE I.R.A. NO ACTION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PREVENT LIBYA FROM PURSUING ITS PROXY WAR FOR LABOUR PEER LORD BRENNAN A SENIOR BARRISTER SAID HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF CASES INVOLVING TERRORIST ATTACKS AND HE DESCRIBED HOW THE SEMTEX EXPLOSIVE PROVIDED BY LIBYA WE USED TO BOOST THE EFFECT OF HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVES IN CAR BOMBS HER PUSSY
I'M SUPPLYING SOME DRAPES TO ENLARGE THE AREA OF DONE
LORD FORGIVE ME BLAST DAMAGE AND FIRST NUMBER OF METRES BLOWING PEOPLE
COME ON DAMAGE YET MORE METRES BURNING THEM ALL RIGHT
I'M SHRAPNEL DAMAGE FROM THE TOURISTS
SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF METRES HE SAID THE UN HAD TAKEN A MUCH HARDER LINE ON EXTRACTING COMPENSATION FROM LIBYA AND THAT WAS BEAT GOES COME ON I SAID IF YOU DON'T WHIP IT STAYS ON THE TERRACES
FOR MOST THIS IS LOOKING MUCH THE AMERICANS
IT'S CAN DO THE SAME HERE
AND FOLD HIM ENJOY THAT THEME WAS PICKED UP BY THE ULSTER UNIONIST LORD ROGAN WHO SAID THE SEMTEX SUPPLIED BY GADDAFI HAD BEEN USED IN BOMBINGS IN ENNISKILLEN IN LISBON IN THE LONDON DOCKLANDS IN HYDE PARK AND IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE CONSERVATIVE M.P. IAN GAO FACED HE SAID WITH THAT TRAIL OF MISERY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAD DOES APPEAR THAT THAT APART FROM SINGING TO PROSECUTE THOSE WHO HAVE CAUSED SUCH CAR
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON FEELING IN HIS PURSUIT OF GUITAR FOR
THE PAYMASTER AND QUARTERMASTER OF MUCH OF SINN FEIN AND I ARRANGED
OVER MY LORD UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT THE IMPRESSION WHICH MANY VICTIMS HAVING ENGLAND
FOR THE GOVERNMENT LORD YOUNGER OF LECCY SAID HE HAD GREAT SYMPATHY WITH THE BELL BUT HE WARNED IT WOULD PUT THE U.K. IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO THE E.U. THE UNITED NATIONS AND UNDER HUMAN RIGHTS LAW WE WANT TO SEE A FAIR SOLUTION FOR ALL THE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
INCLUDING ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY AIP THE I.R.A. AND PARTICULAR AND IN PARTICULAR GADAFFI SPONSORED I.R.A. TERRORIST
HOWEVER THESE CONCERT CONCESSION CLAIMS A PRIVATE MATTERS BEST PURSUE DIRECTLY WITH THE LIBYAN AUTHORITIES ACROSS THE CHAMBER LORD BRENNAN SHOOK HIS HEAD IN DISAPPROVAL
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE PROVIDES FACILITATION SUPPORT TO CAMPAIGN GROUPS WHEN REQUEST
PRUE IT'S LIBYA RECONCILIATION UNIT AND CONTINUES TO STRESS TO THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL CORD SO CALLED
LEGACY ISSUES ARE A PRIORITY OF A GOVERNMENT THAT PRODUCED AN ANGRY RESPONSE FROM THE ULSTER UNIONIST LORD M. P. HE SAID HE WAS SHOCKED BY THE GOVERNMENT REPLY ONLY WEE
IN THIS PART OF THE UNITED CAME AND IN THIS PART OF EUROPE LET ALONE ANYWHERE ELSE COULD COME UP WITH THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
AS AN OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF GETTING THE FUNDS FOR THE VICTIMS WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE WORLD ON ITS HEAD WHY NOT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SCATHING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS NOT A DIRECT CONCERN FOR THE FOREIGN OFFICE IT IS PRECISELY THAT APPROACH THAT IS AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THEIR FAILURE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE
IT'S NOT A PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBBY THIS IS A MARTYR AS LORD AND SAID WHERE THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT P.L.C. SHOULD BE UP FRONT AND CENTRE DEALING WITH HER SMARTER AND FIGHT
LABOUR'S SUPPORTED THE BILL AND AS IS TRADITIONAL IN THE LORDS IT WAS GIVEN AN UNOPPOSED SECOND READING PRIVATE MEMBERS' BILLS FROM THE LORD'S TEND NOT TO GET VERY FAR BUT WITH AN ALL PARTY GROUP BEHIND THIS ONE AND MAY SOON BE AN ATTEMPT TO OPEN A SECOND FRONT BY BRINGING IN THE SAME BILL IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

THANK YOU TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT MORE THAN A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE SIGNED A PETITION TRYING TO GET A JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA SACKED HE HAD GIVEN A SIX MONTH SENTENCE TO A MAN CONVICTED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AMONG THOSE INCENSED BY THE SENTENCE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS WERE IN AN OPEN LETTER TO THE VICTIM TELLING HER HOW ANGRY HE IS HERE IS A SHORT CLIP OF HER IMPACT STATEMENT WHICH IS BEING READ BY MANY MANY PEOPLE I MEET
I BECAME CLOSED OFF ANGRY SELF DEPRECATING TIRED IRRITABLE EMPTY THE ISOLATION AT TIMES WAS UNBEARABLE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME BACK THE LIFE I HAD BEFORE THAT NIGHT EITHER
YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR SHATTERED REPUTATION I REFRIGERATED SPOONS EVERY NIGHT SO WHEN I WOKE UP AND MY EYES WERE PUFFY FROM CRYING I WOULD HOLD THE SPOONS TO MY EYES TO LESSEN THE SWELLING SO THAT I COULD SEE
I SHOWED UP AN HOUR LATE TO WORK EVERY MORNING EXCUSE MYSELF TO CRY IN THE STAIRWELLS I CAN TELL YOU ALL THE BEST PLACES IN THE BUILDING TO CRY WERE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU
THE PAIN BECAME SO BAD THAT I HAD TO EXPLAIN THE PRIVATE DETAILS TO MY BUS TO LET HER NO WAY I WAS LEAVING MY LIFE WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR OVER A YEAR MY STRUCTURE COLLAPSED PART OF THE VICTIM'S STATEMENT SHRED OF COURSE BY AN ACT OF PETER BOWS A CORRESPONDENT IN LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN TELLING ME MORE ABOUT THE CASE
THIS GOES BACK TO JANUARY OF LAST YEAR BROCK TURNER A CHAMPION SWIMMER FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY THAT'S WHEN HE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THIS UNNAMED WOMAN THEY HAD BEEN AT A PARTY ON COMPASS WITNESSES DISCOVERED HER UNCONSCIOUS AND PARTIALLY CLOTHED IN A RUBBISH BIN ESCAPE WHICH WAS NEARBY AND THOSE WITNESSES ACTUALLY INTERVENED THEY HELD BROCK TURNER
UNTIL THE POLICE ARRIVED NOW HE LATER INSISTED THAT THIS HAD BEEN A CONSENSUAL ENCOUNTER HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND GUILTY OF THREE COUNTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE HAS PROMPTED
A HUGE AMOUNT OF OUTRAGE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE JUDGE WHO SENTENCED HIM TO JUST SIX MONTHS IN JAIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A MAXIMUM OF FOURTEEN YEARS THE JUDGE EXPLAINED HIMSELF BY SAYING THAT A PRISON SENTENCE WOULD HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON TURNER AND HE ADDED THAT HE THOUGHT HE WOULD NOT BE A DANGER TO OTHERS AND TURNER'S FATHER HAD BEEN AMONG THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO KEEP THE SENTENCE LOW CORRECT YES HE HAS DEFENDED HIS SON AND IN DOING SO HAS HAS GARNERED WIDESPREAD CRITICISM FOR HIS
COMMENTS HE SAID THAT HIS SON'S LIFE HAD BEEN RUINED FOR QUOTE TWENTY MINUTES OF ACTION FUELLED BY ALCOHOL AND PROMISCUITY
THAT WAS PETER BOWS A CORRESPONDENT LOS ANGELES THE RECALL ACTION AGAINST THE JUDGE IS BEING LED BY MICHEL LANDIS DAVVA WHO WAS A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD
WELL THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CRIME THE FAX DESCRIBE YOU KNOW REALLY QUITE A GRUESOME CRIME IN RICHIE YOUNG WOMAN WAS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY UNCONSCIOUS I HALF NAKED IN THE DIRT
WITH COVERED IN PINE NEEDLES AND BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN PORT FOR PUBLIC VIEW SHE WAS JUST TERRIBLY ABUSED SEXUALLY AND IF THOSE SPICED INTERESTED NOT COME ALONG OUR I REALLY SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO HER
OUNCE ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE JUST A GRUESOME CRIME AND ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY LIGHT SENTENCE IN WHICH THE JUDGE REALLY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY IN ORDER TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THIS ELITE ATHLETE ANNIE VERY HIGH STAN OR SCHOOL
WHAT MOLLY O'NEILL HAS SAID THE LOCAL COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER IS THAT SHE IS ALARMED BY THE HYSTERIA AS SHE PUTS IT SURROUNDING THIS CASE SHE SAYS THE JUDGES REQUIRED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW TO CONSIDER CERTAIN MEDICATING AND AGGRAVATING AGGRAVATING FACTORS
WELL THIS ISN'T ABOUT MEDICATION THE MITIGATED SENTENCE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TWO YEARS A STATUTORY MANDATORY MINIMUM THAT'S THE MITIGATED SENTENCE THERE JUDGE SENTENCED HIM TO ONE QUARTER OF THAT HE SENTENCED HIM TO SIX MONTHS HE'S GOING TO SIR ABOUT EIGHTY SIX
AND HE'S GOING TO BE MY SEPTEMBER A SWIMMING LAPS IN OHIO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JUDGE CONSIDERED THE IMPACT OF THE CRIME AND THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME ON THE VICTOR DO YOU THINK THE JUDGE IS GOING TO GO
ABSOLUTELY I'M ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE NECESSARY MOMENTUM FOR OUR CAMPAIGN I'M I HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND WHAT ABOUT
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND THE WAY THEY HAVE HANDLED ALL OF THIS I THINK HE NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD WORK AT THE ROLE OF FRATERNITY IS IAN IT'S CANVAS CULTURE AND ASK WHERE THEY WERE PERHAPS THE NEGATIVES FOR ATTORNEYS HAVE FINALLY STARTED TO REALLY OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFITS THAT THEY MIGHT DELIVER

SUBJECT OF THIS WEEK'S MAKE THE AUTHOR IS LOUISE DOUGHTY SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO JIM ABOUT THE ART OF SUSPENSE THE PRIVATISATION OF WARS AND SECRECY
LOUISE DOUGHTY HAS A NATURAL FEELING FOR SUSPENSE HOW TO PRODUCE A CRAWLING I KNEES AND YOUR NOVEL BLACK WATER
INTRODUCES US TO A VERY TROUBLED MAN JOHN HARPER WHO TAKES US THROUGH MUCH OF THE POST WAR ERA
FROM THE CIVIL CONFLICT IN INDONESIA BACK TO A JAPANESE WAR CAMP WHERE HE WAS BORN TO AMERICA AND TO AMSTERDAM AND LEADS US INTO A WORLD OF DECEIT AND VIOLENCE THE POINTS
SHE WRITES ABOUT MENACE AS TO WHAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS WELL HARPER LIES AWAKE AT NIGHT AND TROPICAL ISLAND HIT IN INDONESIAN HE'S LISTENING TO THE RAIN ON HIS
HE'S KEPT AWAKE BY THE GECKOS AND THE INSECTS AND THE MONKEYS ON THE VERANDA AND HE THINKS WHAT HE IS AFRAID OF IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HE THINKS THAT MEN WITH MACHETES ARE GOING TO COME AND KILL HIM BUT OF COURSE WHAT HARPER'S REALLY AFRAID OF IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HE'S AFRAID OF SOMETHING THAT HE HIMSELF HAS ALREADY DONE IT'S BECAUSE OF HIS PAST EXPERIENCES THAT HE SAID FEARFUL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT HERE IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT ALL OF US IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO HOLD BACK I THINK THAT EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR LIFE BUT IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS THEY WANT TO ATONE FOR AND IT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING AS DRAMATIC OR SOMETHING IS HUGE AND POLITICAL IS THE THING THAT HARPER HAS IN HIS PAST BUT ALL OF US HAVE HAD OCCASIONS WHERE WE WALK BY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD WHERE THIS SOMEBODY
LOOKING AND WELL IN A BUS STOP OR THERE'S AN OLD LADY STANDING IN A DOORWAY SAYING CAN YOU TALK TO ME WE'VE ALL HAD EXPERIENCES LIKE THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL HAUNTED BY NOT JUST THE BAD THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE FAILED TO DO THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT HARPER HE WAS BORN IN A PRISONER OF WAR CAMP JAPANESE PRISONER OF WAR CAMP THERE WAS GREAT VIOLENCE ATTENDING TENDING HIS CONCEPTION AND BIRTH
IN THIS BOOK VIOLENCE INEVITABLY SEEMS TO BREED VIOLENCE THERE'S A CYCLE THERE REALLY IS AND I MEAN WE SEE THAT ON EVERY LEVEL WE SEE IT WITH INDIVIDUALS WE ALL KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ABUSIVE ARE VERY LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN ABUSED THEMSELVES IN CHILDHOOD BUT WE ALSO SEE IT ON A MACRO POLITICAL LEVEL
ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS HAD A LONG PERIOD OFTEN DECADES OF VIOLENCE I MEAN WE CAN ALL THINK VERY GLOOMILY OF THE FUTURE OF SYRIA AND IRAQ THE MIDDLE EAST ANY COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS KIND OF CONVULSIONS IT TAKES DECADES SOMETIMES GENERATIONS FOR THAT HE'S A WANDERER AS WELL HE'S HALF DUTCH
HE KNOWS AMSTERDAM HE'S LIVED IN CALIFORNIA HE'S BEEN IN INDONESIA HE WAS HE WAS BORN IN A CAMP THERE'S A SENSE IN WHICH HE'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO
TIE THE BOAT TO ITS MOORINGS ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK TO ME IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT HARPER IS MIXED RACE AND I THINK IT IS A NOVEL ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING MIXED MIXED RACE HE'S A MAN WITH A FLOATING ETHNICITY IN WHEN HE'S GROWING UP IN AMSTERDAM HE'S BULLIED FOR BEING BLACK BECAUSE THERE IS AN INDONESIAN COMMUNITY IN AMSTERDAM THAT A LOT OF RACIAL TENSIONS THERE WHEN HE'S IN CALIFORNIA
AND HE GOES TO HER HE'S WHAT HE'S LIVING WITH A BLACK FAMILY AND HE'S GOING TO A SCHOOL LARGELY WITH BLACK CHILDREN HE'S BULLIED FOR BEING JAPANESE IT'S JUST AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR THEY THINK HE'S JAPANESE WHEN HE'S IN INDONESIA THEY THINK HE'S WHITE AND THERE IS A LINE IN THE BOOK WHERE HE SAYS HE FEELS AS THOUGH HIS SKIN TONE GETS WHITER AND WHITER THE FURTHER EAST HE FLIES HE'S A CHAMELEON HE'S A MAN WHO'S NOT AT HOME ANYWHERE BUT ALSO THAT
IS WHAT MAKES HIM GOOD AT HIS JOB HE'S A MAN WHO CAN FIT IN ALMOST ANYWHERE IF YOU NEED TO AS WELL HE PRETENDS TO BE ONE THING HE'S ACTUALLY ACTING NOT AS A TRADITIONAL SPY IN THE SERVICE OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT IN ANOTHER KIND OF UNDERCOVER WAY AND YOU SEEM TO BE TRYING TO DRAW A PICTURE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK REPRESENTS A PARTICULAR STRAIN
IN THE CHAOS OF THE WORLD WE'RE IN NOW WITH STICKS DISINTEGRATING ABOUT ANDRE ALL OVER THE PLACE AS STATES DISINTEGRATE WHAT DO WE SEE THE RISE OF WE SEE THE RISE OF SECURITY FOR HIRE AS WE SAW IN IRAQ PRIVATE CONTRACTORS ARE NOT LIABLE TO COURT MARTIAL IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE ARMY IS SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALMOST SEEING IS THE KIND OF THE PRIVATISATION OF POLITICAL STABILITY WHICH I THINK IS AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS THING HARPER IS REGRETFUL
IS HE REDEEMED WELL THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION THERE IS A QUESTION MARK LEFT OPEN AT THE END OF THE BOOK
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND I DELIBERATELY LEFT THAT OPEN TO INTERPRETATION I KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK DEPENDING ON WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HARPO THAT WILL ALTER YOUR VIEW OF WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO HIM AS THE BOOK COMES TO ITS CONCLUSION I WON'T SAY ANY MORE THAN THAT ALL GOOD BOOKS LEAVE YOU WITH A QUESTION TO PONDER LOUISE DOHERTY AUTHOR OF BLACK WATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT WAS JIM WITH LOUISE DOUGHTY THE TIME A QUARTER TO EIGHT WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HERE WITH US THIS MORNING IS CATHERINE PADS TO HIS EDITOR OF THE TABLET MONICA I WANT TO JUST
WELL THE OPENING MATCH HAS BEEN PLAYED AT THE STICKER ALBUMS ARE BEING FILLED THE SWEEPSTAKES ORGANISED AND FOOTBALL MANIA IS WELL AND TRULY WITH US FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS DURING EURO SIXTEEN FARMS LIKE ME ARE NO LONGER JUST FRETTING ABOUT THE FORTUNES OF OUR USUAL LEAGUE TEAMS IN MY CASE BRADFORD BUT NOW OUR EYES ARE TURNING TO ENGLAND'S ENCOUNTER WITH RUSSIA TONIGHT
THIS KIND OF FURTHER WOULD'VE BEEN VERY FAMILIAR TO SAINT PAUL IS A PISTOLS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT REVEAL HIM AS A FILE OF THE GAMES WHICH TOOK PLACE EVERY OTHER YEAR CLOSE TO CORINTH NO DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL ABOUT THE MORE UNSAVOURY END OF SPORT CHEATING BRAGGING SOMETIMES THE AGGRESSION OF THOSE ATTENDING AS IN SCENES INVOLVING ENGLAND FANS IN MOSS
BUT HE APPROVED OF SPORT TO AND USED IT AS A METAPHOR FOR THE CHRISTIAN LIFE DON'T YOU REALISE THAT THE RUNNERS IN THE STADIUM ALL OF THEM RUN BUT ONLY ONE GETS THE MEDAL YOU WANT TO RUN IN SUCH A WAY AS TO WIN HE SAID IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS TO THE CORINTHIAN KRISTIAN'S URGING THEM TO SIMILAR SINGLE MINDEDNESS
AND HE LATER TOLD THE PHILIP IAN'S NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THEIR OPPONENTS AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION REMINDED RIVALS TO BEHAVE BECAUSE THEY WERE PART OF THE SAME TEAM
ANOTHER USE OF THE SPORTING METAPHOR AND SIMILE WAS POPE JOHN PAUL THE SECOND WHO ONCE SAID THAT THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IS RATHER LIKE A DEMANDING SPORT COMBINING ALL THE PERSON'S ENERGIES TO DIRECT THEM TOWARDS THE PERFECTION OF CHARACTER
BUT JOHN PAUL ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT SPORT IN ITSELF IS A GOOD THAT IT ENCOURAGES WORK DISCIPLINE LOYALTY AND PERSEVERANCE AN ATHLETE HIMSELF IN HIS YOUTH HE ALSO SAW SPORT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE PEACEFUL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN PEOPLES
THERE'S ANOTHER MORE PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECT CHRISTIANITY'S VIEW OF SPORT WHICH COUNTERS THE PROFOUND INFLUENCE OF DESCARTES ON WESTERN THINKING
THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER ADVOCATED THE CONCEPT OF DUALISM ARGUING THAT THERE'S A DISTINCT SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE NON PHYSICAL THEIR MIND OR SPIRIT
MENTAL ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE HE ARGUED AS IF IT IS PARALLEL TO PHYSICAL ACTION ALMOST LIKE A GHOST IN THE MACHINE AS THE ENGLISH PHILOSOPHER GILBERT WHILE PUT IT
BUT IN CHRISTIAN THOUGHT BODY MIND AND SPIRIT ARE ALL PART OF THE SAME FORM
IN THE WORDS OF POPE PAUL THE SIXTH SPORT IS THE GYMNASIUM OF THE SPIRIT A GAME LIKE FOOTBALL SHOWS THAT NOT ONLY THE BODY STRENGTH AND POWER BEING USED BUT SO IS THE MIND AND SPIRIT ALL WORKING IN HARMONY ON THE PITCH
FANS CALL IT THE BEAUTIFUL GAME IT'S ALSO A CHANCE TO SEE GOD'S MASTERPIECE THE HUMAN FORM AT ITS VERY BEST
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH CATHERINE PATENTS THAT THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT TO A LEADING UNIVERSITIES HAD BEEN CHANGING THEIR ADMISSION POLICIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO GIVE POORER YOUNGSTERS A CHANCE TO GET IN IT SEEMED YOU WOULD BE WRONG AND IF THEY HAVE IT'S NOT WORKING SICKNESS JUST PUBLISHED FIRST TIME THESE FIGURES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE WAY SHOW POORER CANDIDATES ARE SEVEN TIMES LESS LIKELY TO BE OFFERED A PLACE THAN RICHER ONES I'M JOINED BY THE LION BY PROFESSOR ON THE LINE BY PROFESSOR
LES EBDON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF FAIR ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND BY LUCY COLLINS IS HEAD OF U.K. STUDENT RECRUITMENT AT BRISTOL UNIVERSITY IF YOU BOTH LOSE LUCY COLLINS AT YOUR UNIVERSITY YOU
TOOK ONLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY STREET WAIT AT THAT VENUE THREE POINT SIX PERCENT OF YOUR INTAKE CAME FROM THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT THAT'S PRETTY SHOCKING ISN'T IT
I THINK THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT WE'RE REALLY PLEASED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU CUSSED PUBLISHED THIS DATA AND WERE HAPPY AT THE UNIVERSITY TO SUBMIT A DATA AND THAT WE'RE REALLY PLEASED BUT IT INDICATES THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO BIAS IN OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT WHAT'S THE KIDS WENT TO YOUR UNIVERSITY WHAT'S ALSO REALLY CLEAR IS THAT THERE IS PLENTY OF WORK TO BE DONE WE'RE AMBITIOUS TO MAKE FASTER PROGRESS AND WE'VE GOT REALLY CLEAR PLANS
IN PLACE TO DO SO SORRY CAN WE JUST CAN WE JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS RATHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE REALLY CLEAR PLANS MIGHT BE FOR THE FUTURE LOOK AT THAT A MINUTE IF WE MAKE BUT EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE REALLY PLEASED WITH ALL OF THIS TO MOST PEOPLE IT WOULD SEEM ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING AND I REPEAT THAT WORD THAT THREE POINT SIX PERCENT CAME FROM POORER PARTS OF THE CITY OR THE COUNTRY RATHER
WHAT DOES IT WAS PLEASED ABOUT WAS THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT TRANSPARENCY WITH OUR DATA WE KNOW THAT THERE IS WORK TO BE TURN YOU KATH IS CONFIRMED AT THE OFFICE THAT WE'RE MAKING TO THOSE STUDENTS FROM SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES ARE WITHIN THE EXPECTED RANGE BASED ON THE APPLICANTS ENTRY QUALIFICATIONS AND OUR OFFER EIGHT BUT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE HAVE REMOTELY COMPLACENT ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE THAT AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE'VE SEEN THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FROM LOWER PERFORMING SCHOOLS FROM LOW PERFORMING NEIGHBOURHOODS AND FROM ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS GO UP THE COLLEEN REPOTTED THEY USED TO BEEN CLEARLY THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S NEED BUYERS AND IN FACT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL
WITH ONE OF THE VERY FIRST UNIVERSITIES TO PUT IN A CONTEXTUAL OFFER POLICY TO LOWER OUR ENTRY QUALIFICATIONS AND OUR OFFICE THE STUDENTS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED GREAT WHAT TOLD ME WHAT EFFORTS WHAT SPECIFIC EFFORT TO MAKE TO GET PEOPLE FROM UNLESS YOU BELIEVE IT ME
YOU MAY WELL BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE WE MAY WANT WELL EXCEPT THAT ONLY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT OF POORER PEOPLE THE STUDENTS SHOULD BE GOING TO A BRISTOL ABRUPT PERHAPS THEY THINK THAT'S HOW IT IS WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T THINK THAT NO ANNE I'M A GOVERNOR OF THE UNIVERSE IS CO SPONSORED SCHOOL WHICH IS IN SOUTH BRISTOL WHICH HOUSE AMONGST THE LOWEST PROGRESSION MATES TO HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY
WE SEE DAY TODAY THEY'RE THE CHALLENGES THAT SOME YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN APPLYING TO THE MOST COMPETITIVE INSTITUTIONS AND ONE ON THE DECK THE GOODIES THEN IF YOU'RE A BRIGHT GIVEN AND IF IT'S ENTIRELY OBVIOUS ISN'T IT THE ONE THIS IS MAKING A POLITICAL POINT IT ENTIRELY OBVIOUS AT THE LOWER AND EXTREMELY THEN MUST BE VERY BRIGHT YOUNG KIDS WHO HAPPENED TO BE POOR WHO AREN'T GETTING INTO DECENT UNIVERSITIES THAT IS CLEARLY THE CASE ISN'T IT
THERE ARE INCREDIBLY
WHAT BRIGHT MOTIVATED INTERESTING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO ATTRACT THE UNIVERSITY I'M GOING TO BECAUSE UNLIKE RICHARD KIDS WHO'VE GOT PARENTS THAT WHO CAN HELP THEM IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS AS WELL THEY CAN PLAY THE SYSTEM THE MIDDLE CLASS KIDS CAN PLAY THE SYSTEM OF THE WAY THE POORER KIDS CARD THAT'S THE THE BRUTAL REALITY ISN'T IT I THINK IT'S A REALLY COMPLEX ISSUE AND I THINK MISTRESS' ILL YEAH I THINK THE STRUCTURAL AND CULTURAL CHALLENGES WHAT WE DO WITH SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE CITY OF WHICH WERE APART
IS TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ASPIRATIONS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AMONGST THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE IT TO HELP STUDENTS TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE IS THE RIGHT SUBJECT CHOICES I KNOW BUT IF YOU WANT TO STUDY MEDICINE FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST COMPETITIVE PROGRAMME IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU'VE CHOSEN THE APPROPRIATE SCIENCE SUBJECT AT G.C.S.E. AND THAT YOU STUDIED THE SUBJECTS THAT YOU WILL NEED A CHAPEL AND TO BE MADE AN OFFER
WE ALSO WORK WITH POST SIXTEEN PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT REALLY GOOD PERSONAL STATEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NOT BE GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM HOME ARE ABLE TO
TO REALLY WELL ARTICULATE THEIR TALENTS COS WE KNOW THERE ARE BRILLIANT STEWS AND WE WORK WITH THEM EVERY DAY SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BRISTOL WELL I'M WILLING TO LET ME I'M NOT WHAT SUCH A LOT THREE POINT SIX PERCENT IS THAT A LOT PROFESSOR EBBERSTON PROFESSOR EBDEN FORGIVE ME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE FIGURES FIRST OF ALL
A VERY PLEASED THEY'VE BEEN PUBLISHED THE PRIME MINISTER HAS A STRONG AMBITION TO DOUBLE THE RATES OF DISAVOW WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FIGURES AND HIM LOOK OBVIOUSLY THE MORE OF THAT NOT A SURPRISE TO ME BECAUSE I'VE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT WE HAVE A RARE VERY BIG CHALLENGE INDEED IN UNIVERSITIES LIKE RESTORER ISN'T IT YOUR JOB TO CORRECT IT YES INDEED I'M PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL I THINK LUCY WOULD CONFIRM
I NOT VERY WELL FORGIVE ME IF IT'S ONLY THREE POINT SIX PERCENT AND THEY WERE HAVING A GO AT BRISTOL HERE BUT WE COULD APPLY THIS TO LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHER UNIVERSITIES CAMBRIDGE IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON AND SO ON AND SO ON YES KING'S COLLEGE YES IN TWENTY TEN BRISTOL HAD ONLY SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS FROM THE MOST DISADVANTAGED AREAS NOW THEY HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THAT IS PROGRESS BUT IT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH PROGRESS AND I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THE
PLANS THAT BRISTOL RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TO ENGAGE MUCH MORE WITH THEIR LOCAL AREA TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS ABOUT RAISING ATTAINMENT AS AS WELL AS ASPIRATION IN THE SCHOOL BUT LOOK ISN'T IT I THINK TO BRISTOL HAS TO LOOK AT THESE FIGURES AND ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHY DOES SEVENTY PERCENT OF WHITE APPLICANTS GET AN OFFER AND ONLY FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF BLACK APPLIQUE AND ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT THE BETTER THE UNIVERSITY THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF WELL OFF STUDENTS THAT TOLD US ALL WE NEED TO KNOW REALLY DOESN'T IT
WELL I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE WITH THE WAY THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED TO BETTER RAM UNIVERSE IN WELL WHAT IT CHARGED ASK FOR THE HIGHEST TARIFF ON ENTRY THAT THOSE WHICH HAVE THE GREATEST PROBLEM IN TERMS OF A DIVERSE STUDENT ENTRY YOUR SEVEN POINT SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE OF A HIGH TARIFF UNIVERSITY IF YOU COME FROM THE MOST ADVANTAGE WHEN YOU FEEL A BIT CAN WE USE PEOPLE I WAS THE BEST UNIVERSITIES
THOSE UNIVERSITIES WHICH HIGH ASK FOR THE HIGHEST A LEVEL POINTS ON ENTRY YEAH EXACTLY AND OF THOSE UNIVERSITIES THE CHANCES OF GETTING IN IF YOU'RE A WELL OFF STUDENT A MASSIVELY GREATER THAN IF YOU'RE A POOR STUDENT THAT SUPPORTS THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF IT ISN'T IT IT IS INDEED AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ACCESS AGREEMENTS WHY WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF
A PRESSURE WHY WE SEEN A SIXTY ONE PER CENT INCREASE IN THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS IN NOW UNIVERSITIES WHY WE'VE SEEN A FORTY EIGHT PER CENT INCREASE IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR PHARAOH BUT IT IS STILL SMALL
YES IT IS THE SIZE OF THE CHALLENGES IN ALMOST THE MOUNTAIN WE HAVE TO CLIMB HERE IS VERY BIG WE KNOW THAT SOCIAL MOBILITY HAS SINCE COME TO ALMOST THE STANDS TO A SOCIETY THAT UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO GET IT MOVING AGAIN THE PRIME MINISTER'S DETERMINED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I'M DETERMINED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I'M PLEASED THAT BRISTOL HAVE ANNOUNCED SOME SIGNIFICANT NEW MEASURES TO IMPROVE SOCIAL MOBILITY THERE
WE HAVE TO END IT THERE THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED BOTH OF YOU PROFESSOR LES EBDEN AND LUCY COLLINS THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR LOOK AT THE WEATHER HAIR IS TOSH UP AND I AM ON THOMAS JUSTIN VERY GOOD MORNING TO JUSTIN JOHN AND EVERYONE ELSE

YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR JONNA PRISON JUSTIN WEBB CRESCENT WHICH IS HERE AT TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE THE SUMMIT THE NEXT A GROUP OF BRITISH NOBEL LAUREATES HAS ADDED TO WARNINGS IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ABOUT THE RISKS TO FUTURE RESEARCH OF BRITAIN QUITS THE EUROPEAN UNION THEY ARGUE THAT INSIDE THE ORGANISATION BRITAIN HELPS STEER THE BIGGEST SCIENTIFIC POWERHOUSE OF THE WORLD BUT THE BOAT LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAID MONEY FOR RESEARCH CAME FROM BRITAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE Y. U. NOT A MAGICAL MONEY TREE IN BRUSSELS
THE INVENTOR AND ENTREPRENEUR SIR JAMES DYSON SAYS THE U.K. SHOULD LEAVE THE E.U. HE SAID BRITAIN WOULD CREATE MORE WEALTH AND MORE JOBS BY BEING OUTSIDE
MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RECOGNISED FOR THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY HONOURS FORTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN IN THE CABINET OFFICE SAYS IT'S THE MOST DIVERSE LIST TO DATE
SCIENTISTS SAY FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY A CLEAR VIEW OF STARS IN THE NIGHT SKY BECAUSE OF A RAPID INCREASE IN ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS SAID LIGHT POLLUTION WAS HIDING THE VIEW OF THE GREATEST WONDER OF NATURE THE UNIVERSE ITSELF
TWENTY FIVE TO NINE TWELVE DAYS TO GO AND IT'S ENDING AS IT BEGAN PRETTY MUCH THE TWO BIG ISSUES IN THE REFERENDUM UP IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY BOTH IMMENSELY COMPLEX ON ONE LEVEL BUT IN THE END WE'LL MAKE OUR DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT WE THINK IT WILL MEAN FOR US PROBABLY OUR JOBS OUR FAMILIES OUR FUTURES I'M GOOD REPORTING ON IMMIGRATION NEXT WEEK AT THIS TIME OF THE PROGRAMME BUT THIS MORNING IT'S THE ECONOMY
THERE IS ONE OVERRIDING FACTOR IN THIS ECONOMIC DEBATE BUT IT IS TRUE OF EVERY INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRY ON THE PLANET IF THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO GROW WE HAVE TO MAKE THINGS AND SELL THEM TO OTHER COUNTRIES BUT THE QUESTION THAT FOLLOWS IS WHETHER WE CAN SELL MORE AND DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND PROFITABLY INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION OR OATS
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN A BRUSH FACTORY IN WILTSHIRE LOVELY LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED ME
THIS FADED PRODUCTION MACHINERY HERE MAKING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT BRUSHES FOR A VACUUM CLEANER BRUSHES YARD
EVERY SORT OF BRUSH YOU CAN THINK ABOUT PHILIP COWARD TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IT'S CALLED HE'LL BRUSH FROM HIS FATHER AND TAKEN IT OVER FROM HIS FATHER A REAL FAMILY BUSINESS AND NOW HE MAKES A THOUSAND BRUSHES AND HOUR AND EMPLOYS NINETY PEOPLE AND HE WANTS TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN
BUT THE LEAF CAMPAIGN SAYS WE COULD SELL MORE OVERSEAS IF WE WERE ON OUR OWN
MISTER COWARD CELLS TO NINETY COUNTRIES AND HE SAYS THE E.U. HAVE TRADING ARRANGEMENTS WITH I THINK SIXTY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR US TO SUPPLY
FOR INSTANCE SOUTH AFRICA'S INCLUDED IN THAT AND WE WOULD HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE ALL OF THOSE AGREEMENTS NOW I KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING YES WE COULD DO IT WOULD BE EASY BUT IT WOULD ALL TAKE TIME AND IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR PROBLEM AND SELLING TO
A EUROPEAN COUNTRY SO SHE'S JUST COMPLETELY STRAIGHTFORWARD I MEAN WE CAN SHIP STUFF THE PAPERWORK HAS TO BE FAR LESS AND SENDING IT TO A NON E.U. COUNTRY THERE KNOW TARIFFS IS JUST MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD
WHOA UP AN HOUR AND A HALF DRIVE ACROSS WILTSHIRE TAKES YOU TO AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE OUTSIDE SWINDON

AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY HAD A RADICAL EFFECT ON HOW THEY'VE HAD TO NOW LOOK AT THEIR COMMERCIALS IN THEIR PRICING IN HOW YOU PAY FOR YOUR MOBILE PHONES GREAT FOR THE CONSUMER
POTENTIALLY BUT AS ALL THINGS IN LIFE CORPORATES GENERALLY DON'T LIKE MAKING LESS MONEY IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY AFFECT US WE ARE TAKING REVENUE FROM THOSE ROAMING SERVICES WE DO WE HAVE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND MOBILE USES A LOT PROPORTIONS ARE USING THEIR PHONES ABROAD AND IN THE E.U. SO IT WILL DIRECTLY AFFECT THE REVENUE ROUND THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS THIS YEAR
TWO SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT HOLD IN OR OUT BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE BASING THOSE VIEWS ON THEIR OWN ORDER BOOKS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ON THE SUCCESS OF THEIR BUSINESSES THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE BUSINESSES MOST OF US GET TOLD WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING BY ECONOMISTS
AND HOW DID THEY KNOW THEY CREATE MODELS NOT WITH PLAYDOUGH OR LEGO ADMITTEDLY BUT WITH A COMPUTER AND MASSES OF DATA A CYNIC MIGHT SAY HALF THE TIME THEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL USE PLAYDOUGH
HERE'S CHARLIE BEEN USED TO BE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND THE KEY THING ABOUT MODELLING IS YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DESCRIBE THE JOINT BEHAVIOUR OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES
BE THERE AYE SHE D. PAY UNEMPLOYMENT THE CURRENT ACCOUNT OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATE THANKS LIKE
NOW WE DO HAVE PAST HISTORY STATISTICS ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST WHICH CAN SOMETIMES GIVE US A GUIDE TO HOW THINGS MIGHT BEHAVE AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL THEN WHERE THE SORT OF PHENOMENON YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE BUT THE POINT ABOUT BRECK'S IT IS THAT IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE TODAY HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND TURBULENT DAY SHORT WE'VE HAD
MEGA FINANCIAL CRISES ARE LOTS OF THEM MASSIVE SPECULATIVE FLOWS HAVE CONTINUED TO DISRUPT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CHANGE RATE MECHANISM JOINING THE E.R.M. ENDED UP WITH INTEREST RATES GOING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE IT JUST BEGGARS BELIEF THAT IF THE CHANCE WHAT EXCHEQUER ON A DAY LIKE WEDNESDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF SEPTEMBER WANTED TO SEE THE PRIME MINISTER THAT ANYBODY KEPT HIM AT A DISTANCE BRITAIN'S BANKS NEARLY RAN OUT OF MONEY WERE NORTHERN ROCK
WE FEEL THAT POSSIBLY SOMETHING COULD BE SAVED
BUT IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE BUT IT WAS IT
THEREFORE I'D LIKE TO REMOVE IT AS QUICKLY AS I CAN THANKS HAVE GOT MONEY BUT THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO LEND TO EACH OTHER AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS IN AMERICA THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WENT INTO MELTDOWN AFTER LEHMAN BROTHERS WENT THE SAME WAY ALBEIT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
THE COLLAPSE OF ONE OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT BANKS AND SENT SHOCKWAVES AROUND THE WORLD SHARE PRICES HAVE PLUMMETED AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE IN JEOPARDY I'M LOOKING PRETTY BAD WHEN I CAME
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WE WERE JUST TALKING LAST ARIA NOT TO COME BACK TO TOMORROW MAY HAVE OUR CITIZENSHIP SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS IN THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING HERE'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS ACTING
TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS AND RESTORE STABILITY TO A MARKET AND THERE'S ALWAYS THIS TO WORRY ABOUT THE PRICE OF OIL HAS FALLEN TO A FOUR YEAR LOW DRAGGING DOWN STOCK MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD WHO WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT OIL PRICES HAVE DROPPED SO PRECIPITOUSLY THOSE VERY BIG CHANGES
AND I DON'T THINK MUCH WOULD EVER EXPECT ECONOMIST TO BE ABLE TO FORECAST THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BUT SURELY THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF MODELLING ISN'T IT JUST LIKE THE MET OFFICE USES COMPUTERS TO FORECAST THE WEATHER IN ECONOMICS WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY APPROACHES THAT WE HAVE VERY POOR DATA
BASED ON INCOMPLETE SAMPLES HUMAN NATURE WHICH IS NOT FIXED AND IT INTERACTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN WEATHER FORECASTING SO ONE SHOULDN'T EXPECT TOO MUCH
ECONOMIC FORECASTING IT WON'T FORETELL THE FUTURE IT DOES HELP YOU GET A HANDLE ON POSSIBLE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE FROM PARTICULAR EVENT SO IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE
WETTING YOUR FINGER HIM STICKING IN THE AIR TO SEE WHICH WAY THE WIND'S BLOWING BUT IT'S NOT GOOD IT'S NOT PURE SPECULATION CALL IT INFORMED SPECULATION IF YOU LIFE REASSURING UP TO UP TO A POINT BUT I THINK THE KEY THING IS TO RECOGNISE THOSE LIMITATIONS I THINK ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IS THAT PEOPLE
HAVE AN OVER AMBITIOUS EXPECTATION OF WHAT THEY THINK CAN BE DELIVERED BY ECONOMIC FORECASTERS THAT'S ASSUMING THEY HAVE THE FIRST IDEA WHAT TO MAKE OF THOSE ECONOMIC FORECASTS THEY ARE SO WILDLY DIVERGENT HAS BETWEEN ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER
THE POOR OLD PUNTER DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE HERE'S WHAT PROFESSOR PATRICK MINFORD THE LEADING ECONOMIST ON THE BRAKES IT SIDE SAYS WOULD HAPPEN IF WE LEAVE THE E.U.
BRECHT SAID FRANKLY WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY BACK WE WILL BE FREED OF THE INCUBUS THE CUSS US A HUGE AMOUNT FROM THE P. WILL BE FOUR PER CENT
BECAUSE OF THE UNILATERAL FREE TRADE POLICIES WILL WE'LL GET EVEN MORE GROWTH FROM THE ABANDONMENT OF REALLY INTRUSIVE E.U. REGULATION WILL GET OUR MONEY BACK FROM BRUSSELS
WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP THE MANUFACTURERS WHO WERE UNDER PRESSURE AND THEY WILL THANK US FOR LEAVING AND GIVING THEM A DYNAMIC FUTURE INSIDE YOU KNOW THE WORLD ECONOMY INSTEAD OF
COOPED UP INSIDE THIS PROTECTIONIST REGIONAL BACKWARD LOOKING OVER REGULATED SO THAT'S IT THEN SORTED UNTIL YOU TALK AS I DID TO THE LEADING ECONOMIST FOUR REMAIN
ANDREW SENTENCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT THE ACCOUNTANCY FIRM P.W.C. ALSO A FORMER BANK OF ENGLAND MAN THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE THAT WOULD HAPPEN ALMOST DEFINITELY IN OTHER WORDS WE MAY WELL FACE SOME ADDITIONAL TARIFF BARRIERS IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION WE WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET ON EXACTLY THE SAME TERMS THAT WE HAVE NOW
IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST EXACTLY HOW INVESTMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FROM BUSINESSES IS THAT THEY WOULD BE QUITE RELUCTANT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE U.K. AT THE SAME RATE AS THEY DO NOW IF WE WEREN'T A FULL MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
BUT DOESN'T THAT FULL MEMBERSHIP CARRY A PRICE THE BURDEN OF REGULATION RED
WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THAT DON'T WE EVERYONE MOANS ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME JAMES PHIPPS CERTAINLY DOES WE HAVE TO DO A DESK ASSESSMENT DESK DESK ASSESSMENT FOR STAFF SO HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH SAYS ARE THEY SING IN THE RIGHT POSITION AND THEY USE THEIR KEYBOARD CORRECTLY EXCEPT HER AND THAT'S NOW GONE FROM BEING HALF A PAGE TO THREE PAGES LONG
AND THE LIST OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OF A BUSINESS IS SIXTY PEOPLE I'VE GOT SOMEONE NOW JUST LOOKING OFF TO HEALTH AND SAFETY PROFESSOR MINFORD HAS GOT A REAL PROBLEM WITH REGULATION TWO WE HAVE WORKING TIME DIRECTIVES ON HOW MUCH WE CAN WORK WE HAVE
ENORMOUS INTERVENTION IN THE LABOUR MARKET WE'VE GOT THE FINANCIAL SERVICES LEGISLATION COMING FROM THERE FROM THE E.U. WHICH IS ENORMOUSLY HOSTILE TO WHAT THEY CALL ANGLO SAXON FINANCE WE HAVE HERE A HUGE REGULAR TIVE JUGGERNAUT WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN LIFE TO THREW US A SPOUSAL OF THE SINGLE MARKET
BACK ON THE FACTORY FLOOR WHERE YOU MIGHT THINK THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF RED TAPE TO WORRY ABOUT WELL THIS MIGHT SURPRISE YOU PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE E.U. REGULATIONS WE LOVE THAT
BECAUSE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF REGULATIONS BROUGHT IN TO DO WITH THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY WHICH WE SUPPLYING A BIG WAY AND PEOPLE NEED OUR PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THE REGULATIONS SO
I THINK A LOT OF THESE REGULATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED ANYWAY EVEN IF WE HADN'T BEEN IN EUROPE AND PEOPLE SEEM TO FORGET THAT THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BECAUSE THE COMING FROM EUROPE THEY WOULD NEVER
IF WE'VE JUST BEEN ON HER OWN BUT THEY WOULD'VE DONE MENU
AND ANDREW SENTENCE THE ECONOMIST FROM THE REMAIN CAMPAIGN HAS NO PROBLEM WITH REGULATION
YES WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE REGULATIONS OF THE SINGLE MARKET BUT IT GIVES US ACCESS TO THAT MARKET THEN THERE'S SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT REGULATION AND A LOT OF THAT I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO KEEP IN PLACE BECAUSE WE LIKE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN BUSINESSES ARE OPERATING THEY MEET THE RIGHT SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS SO WE MAY HAVE IT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORM BUT I THINK IT'S SLIGHTLY MISLEADING FOR BUSINESSES TO THINK THAT THEY CAN
SHRUG OFF ALL THAT REGULATION JUST BY LEAVING THE E.U. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE ECONOMIST MODELLERS BUSINESSMEN CAN AGREE ON WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION
WELCOME TO OUR OLD FRIEND UNCERTAINTY WHAT IS MOST UNCERTAIN IT IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE MOVED OUTSIDE COULD WE STRIKE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES WHAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA THAT'S THE BIG AREA OF UNCERTAINTY AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IT
BUT HERE AGAIN THEY DIFFER BECAUSE PROFESSOR MINFORD FROM THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGNING SEES THIS TIME OF TURBULENCE AS AN OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN A THREAT WE ARE GOING TO GO FOR UNILATERAL FREE TRADE WE'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE POLICIES TO HELP SPREAD COMPETITION THREW THE PARTS OF THE ECONOMY THAT THE E.U. HAS PROTECTED WE'RE GOING TO HELP THOSE SECTORS TO RAISE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY IN THE CASE OF MANUFACTURING GO TO HIGH TECH
IN THE CASE OF FARMERS WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE FARMERS THAT REALLY NEED HELP WE'RE GOING TO PUSH THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY INTO MORE PRODUCTIVE PRACTICES AND THE POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM LOWER PRICES
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY WILL BE AFFECTED OUT IN THE REAL WORLD IF WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN
WELL WE KNOW WE HAVE BEEN FED SOME MISLEADING STATISTICS PRESENTED AS
WE KNOW WE DON'T SEND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO BRUSSELS WE KNOW EVERY FAMILY WON'T BE FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WORSE OFF
SOMETHING ELSE WE KNOW IS THAT TALKING TO POLITICIANS AND CAMPAIGNERS
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO RUN BUSINESSES AND THOSE WHO WORK FOR THEM
I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE OUR OWN COUNTRY AGAIN AND IT BE LIKE THE STEELWORKS IN ENGLISH PRODUCTS
I JUST HOPE IT'S GOING TO BOOST A COT ANY ECONOMY I JUST RECKON LEAVING WOULD BE BEST IF YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE COMPANY
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE WORRIED BECAUSE IT'S THE UNKNOWN IT'S SUNSET AND WE'RE PRETTY STABLE AT THE MOMENT THINGS HAVE BEEN GOOD THEY ARE GOOD AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS FRUSTRATING BEING IN THESE SOMETIMES
IF WE CAN WE GET ME NEGOTIATE A FEW THINGS AND STAY I THINK WOULD BE A LOT BETTER IF WE LEFT YOU A LITTLE BIT UNDECIDED
I MEAN EVEN WHEN WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE POUND DROPS AND I THINK IF WE DID LEAVE THE POWER DROP
BUT THEN AS THE UNKNOWN OR WHETHER IT WOULD RISE AGAIN AND I IMAGINE IF IT DROPPED IT WOULD AFFECT THINGS LIKE MORTGAGE RATES WHICH OBVIOUSLY WOULD AFFECT MY DAILY LIFE
O.K. AND WHAT SPEC WOULD YOU LIKE ON THE HEID DO YOU NEED A LARGE MEMORY FOR THAT THEN
IT IS A WORRY SOMETIMES IF THE VALUE THE POUNDS DROPPING FOR THAT CHEF I SHALL START DROPPING THEN EVERYBODY RELIES ON THE PENSION INVESTED IN PENSION FUNDS
WE'LL BE ASKING QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THAT DECISION IS IS CORRECT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY WOULD PUNISH US FOR LEAVING EUROPE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN
BUT I DO THINK THAT ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL IT COULD HAVE SOME IMPACT ON ON HOW WE TRADE AND HOW WE RELATE
MORE JOBS ARE CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO BUILD UP SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY IF SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL THEN THE NATION PAYS A MASSIVE PRICE
PHILIP COWARD IS ENTIRELY CONFIDENT THAT HIS BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE WHETHER WE LEAVE OR WHETHER WE STAY WE AS A COMPANY WOULD SURVIVE WHATEVER HAPPENS
BUT I THINK THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE PROBLEMS THAT WOULD ARISE WOULD NOT BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO STAY I CHAIR A COMMITTEE OF EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS THERE WHICH LOOKS AFTER THEIR SORT OF HYGIENE BRUSHES THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND IT'S PRODUCED A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
A COMPANY'S ALWAYS GOES SURVIVE JAMES PHIPPS TO WHO IS SURE THAT HIS BUSINESS WILL SURVIVE OR REMAIN VOTE BUT IF WE REMAIN IN THE EUROPEAN UNION I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A BUSINESS OWNER IN TWENTY YEARS' TIME ABSENT FOR ME IT'S BLACK AND WHITE
SO I FEEL THAT PASSIONATELY THAT THE PROJECT AS IT IS NOW IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT'S GENUINE CHANGE YOU'VE BEEN OFFERED THEN I'D HAVE BEEN MORE THAN WILLING AND IN FACT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE AROUND REMAINING INSIDE THE
BUT WITHOUT A GENUINE CHANGE I THINK THE PROJECT IS DOOMED TO FAIL AND THEREFORE I DON'T WANNA HANG AROUND TO SEE IT HAPPEN SO THERE'S THE DIFFERENCE ONE MAN WANTS TO LEAVE ONE MAN WANTS TO STAY
BUT IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE WHO THINKS THE ECONOMY WILL REALLY CRASH AND BURN IN OR OUT IF THERE IS I COULDN'T FIND THEM
NEXT WEEK AT UPSTATE I'LL BE LOOKING AT WHAT MOST PEOPLE SEE AS THE MAIN BIT OF THE DEBATE IMMIGRANT
TIME NOW THOUGH TO NINE MINUTES TO NINE FOR LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND A NUMBER TEN PANICS AS LEAVE SURGES OF THE FRONT PAGE HEADLINE IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE PAPER REPORTS GROWING ALARM AMONG REMAINED SUPPORTERS AT WHAT THE EYE NEWSPAPER CALLS A MASSIVE SWING TO BREAKS SET IN THE POLLS THE TELEGRAPH SAYS IT'S LE DAVID CAMERON TO ADOPT A TAKE OUT BORIS STRATEGY WITH THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP BRITAIN IN THE E.U. ORCHESTRATING A SERIES OF HIGHLY PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THE PROMINENT SUPPORTER IT'S A THEME TAKEN UP BY THE TELEGRAPHS MATT CARTOON HE CHOSE THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY GUN SALUTE
IN WHICH THE OFFICER IN CHARGE TELLS HIS MEN THE P.M.'S SAID IF YOU CAN HIT BORIS IT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATE THE SON CLAIMS TORY BACKERS OF BRECHT'S HE'D A FURIOUS AFTER BORIS JOHNSON WAS MOCKED BY THE PRO Y. YOU ENERGY SECRETARY AMBER RUDD DURING THURSDAY NIGHTS TELEVISION REFERENDUM BUT THE PAPER'S HEADLINE
AMBER RUDE MUCH OF THE ATTENTION IS ON BLUE ON BLUE ATTACK SO CALLED INVOLVING CONSERVATIVE M.P.S THE GUARDIAN OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES THAT BOTH FOCUS ON LABOUR'S ROLE IN THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN THE F.T. URGES THE LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN A RALLY BEHIND THE REMAIN CAMP WARNING THAT THE PARTY'S CONFUSION ON THE ISSUE HE'S HOBBLING THE EMPTY BRECK CITY
THE DAILY MAIL ACCUSED THE PRIME MINISTER OF ABUSING THE SYSTEM BY DISHING OUT OF GOGGLES AS THE PAPER PUTS IT TO AT LEAST TWENTY BUSINESS CHIEFS AND OTHER PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT BRITAIN TO STAY IN THE E.U. ARISE SO REMAIN HERE'S THE HEADLINE THE GOVERNMENT HAS INSISTED HELMETS LESTER'S DRAWN UP AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE IS COMPLETELY UNCONNECTED TO THE E.U. REFERENDUM
OTHER TIMES REPORTS THAT UNIVERSITIES AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF TURNING A BLIND EYE TO MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF ALLEGEDLY DIRTY MONEY POURED INTO THEIR COFFERS BY FOREIGN STUDENTS ANTI CORRUPTION CAMPAIGNERS HAVE TOLD PAPER THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A DESTINATION FOR CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS TO LAUNDER REPUTATIONS AND MONEY BY BUYING PLACES FOR THEIR CHILDREN FINANCING UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS AND BANKROLLING RESEARCH PRODUCTS THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY UNIVERSITIES U.K. THEY SAY INSTITUTIONS HAVE TAKEN ROBUST MEASURES TO PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING
THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE WHAT A CHALLENGE FOR POLICING THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS ARE FROM THE VERY REAL THREAT OF TERRORISM OF COURSE DOWN TO CROWD CONTROL OF FANS AND SUMMER AREN'T REAL FANCY JUST PEOPLE BENT ON VIOLENCE ALL BE AT LOW LEVEL VIOLENCE THE FRENCH HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TOUGH ON WHAT THEY REGARD AS HOOLIGANISM WE'VE SEEN TEAR GAS IN MARSEILLES FOR TWO NIGHTS RUNNING
WE CAN TALK NOW TO MARK ROBERTS WHO IS THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF'S COUNCIL LEAD FOR FOOTBALL POLICING THAT GOLD COMMANDER AS THEY CALL IT HEADING UP SECURITY THREE HOME NATIONS IN FRANCE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER ROBERTS IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING
DID WE WERE HEARING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAMME THE VIEW OF AN ACADEMIC FROM MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY STUDIES FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM AND WAS THERE IN MARSEILLES THAT ACTUALLY THE FRENCH PLACE ALREADY ARE OVERREACTING DO YOU THAT POSSIBLY TRUE
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO APPRECIATE IT'S A DIFFERENT POLICING CONCEPTS AS WE PLACE IN A STYLE THE FRENCH WILL CREASE IN THEIR STYLE AND THAT'S WHAT THEIR OWN CITIZENS IN A TRAIT DISPUTES OR PUBLIC ORDER WITH VISITING FANS AS WELL IT'S A DIFFERENT STYLE ON A DIFFERENT APPROACH I THINK WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY IN MARSEILLE IN INDEED THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS A FAIRLY TOXIC MIX WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS HOOLIGAN GROUPS FROM RUSSIA DETERMINED CAUSE TROUBLE IT WAS ALSO THE LOCAL MARSEILLES OR CHRIS AGAIN
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE I INTO THE MIX TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ENGLISH SUPPORTERS THE MAJORITY OF HIM JUST WANT TO GO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ENJOY THEMSELVES BUT EQUALLY THERE'S A LARGE ANTI SOCIAL THAT WHO DRINK TO EXCESS MAKE THEMSELVES VERY PEACEABLE AND MAKE THEMSELVES A TARGET FOR THESE ARE THE RISK GROUPS
BUT WHAT WAS BEING SUGGESTED TO US IS THAT ALL THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THEM IS ALWAYS ONE AT A TIME AND THE PERSON WE WERE TALKING TO WERE SAYING THERE ARE FEWER THAN A DOZEN WHO ARE REALLY HARDCORE VIOLENT PEOPLE AND THE THING TO DO IS INDIVIDUALLY TAKE THEM AWAY
I THINK OUR APPROACH IS GENERALLY NOT VERY MUCH THAT TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC RISK GROUPS TARGET THEM CONTAIN THEM AND THEIR MAKE EARLY INTERVENTION REGISTERED THAT THE FRENCH POLICE SHOULD DO THAT OF COURSE WE WE ATE WITH THEM WE ADVICE FROM WHAT WE THINK WORKS WITH ENGLISH SUPPORTERS THAT HAVE THEY TOLD YOU THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
NOW THERE'S A GOOD DIALOGUE WITH THEM BUT YOU'VE GOT TO APPRECIATE DIFFERENT CONTEXT ONE VERY SIMPLE THING TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE FRENCH RENOUNCE SERVICE AND WHERE'S YOUR SEE ENGLISH POLICE OFFICERS VERY UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL PROTESTERS PUSH ENSURE THAT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE MEANS IF YOUR HONOUR ARMED OFFICER YOU SIMPLY CANNOT GET THAT CLOSE TO PEOPLE IF YOU'RE IN POSSESSION OF A FIREARM FOR THE OBVIOUS RISK SO IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY
THE FRENCH HAVE GOT IT WRONG IT'S A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THEY WERE POLICE OUR SPORT IS IN THE WAY THAT THEY POLICE THEIR OWN PEOPLE ON OCCASIONS THAT FROM USING TUCK TEX THAT THE PIT WAS WERE EXTREMELY ROBUST WE WOULD VERY RARELY IF EVER USE TEAR GAS IN A PUBLIC ORDER SITUATION BECAUSE TOWARDS THAT SALIENT THAT'S NOT ONE OF OUR TACTICS IN FRANCE IT'S A ROUTINE TACTIC TO DEAL WITH RELATIVELY MINOR I SUPPOSE WHAT MATTERS AS WHICH TYPED IT WORKS
AND THEY WILL DETERMINE WHAT WAITS FOR THEM IN FRANCE I THINK SUPPORTS NEED TO BE WHERE ARE IN FRANCE THE POLICE AND STYLE IS DIFFERENT WE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO SUPPORTERS AND WE WERE ADVISED WE WILL GIVE THEM COUNSELLING WHAT WORKS BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S A FRENCH POLICING OPERATION AND THEY WILL BE TIM TACTICS IT'S A FRENCH POLICING OPERATION BUT YOU DO HAVE POWERS DON'T YOU WANTED TO TO BRING PEOPLE BACK AND IF YOU FIND SOMEONE WHO IS REALLY CAUSING A LOT OF TROUBLE THEN THEN YOU CAN INTERVENE NO
WE HAVE NO POWERS IN FRANCE WE CAN PUT A BIT IN ADVANCE YOU CAN INTERVENE HERE ABSOLUTE YES AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN A REALLY SUCCESSFUL PART OF OUR OPERATION WE FOCUSED ON THE RISK SUPPORTERS THOSE PEOPLE SWITCH IT TO BANNING ORDERS THERE'S NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE WILL HAVE HAD A LARGE OPERATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAVE TO SURRENDER THEIR PASSPORTS AND THE POINT IS THAT SOMEONE UPON US TRYING TO GET IN SOMEONE WHO MISBEHAVES I WAS YOU CAN'T
GO TO FRANCE AND BRING THEM BADLY SAW MISBEHAVES IN FRANCE AND IS IDENTIFIED ABS BEING A SERIOUS OFFENDER THEN THAT WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU WILL ENFORCE HERE ABSOLUTELY WE'VE HAD A NINETY NINE PERCENT SUCCESS RATE AND STOPPING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOTES WAS FROM TRAVELLING IT'S INCREDIBLE IT'S A HEIST THAT BEST ASSISTED WITH THE HERD WE'VE ISSUED ALL THIRTEEN BANNING ORDERS BY STOPPING PEOPLE TRAVELLING OUT OF THE COUNTRY ALREADY
WE'VE STOOD UP THE INVESTIGATION TEAM LAST NIGHT AS OF LAST NIGHT THEY WERE REVIEWING FOOTAGE FROM THE MEDIA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA IF WE IDENTIFY U.K. CITIZENS INVOLVED IN DISORDER WE WILL PUT THE INFORMATION BEFORE A COURT SEEK BUNGLED WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE U.K. AND TO PUT THE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS
NO AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT TO MAKE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE ENGLISH SPORTS ON THE WHOLE TO BE CHARACTERISED AS THEY WERE WE GET FEEDBACK FROM ENGLAND SUPPORTERS IS HE'S FAR BETTER TO BE IN ONE SUPPORTER NOW WHEN YOU TRAVEL ABROAD YOU GENERALLY GET A FAIR HEARING FROM THE LOCAL POLICE YOU WELCOMED WHEREAS IN THE EIGHTIES IT WAS A PRETTY UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE YOU MET WITH RIOT POLICE AND DOGS AND WE DON'T WANT THAT'S RETURN MOST OF ALL FOR THE INTERESTS OF THOSE PEOPLE WAS SUPPORTING WENT BROKE
AND OF COURSE THE THREAT OF TERRORISM REALLY HANGING OVER THIS I MEANT HIS OVERALL BIGGER BANDS AT THE MOMENT BUT BUT PARTICULARLY THIS THIS TOURNAMENT IT IN TERMS OF THE POLICING IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE CROWDS ARE POLICED DOES THAT HAVE AN IMPACT
IS IT LIKELY TO MAKE THE FRENCH POLICE COULD YOU UNDERSTAND IF THE FRENCH POLICE WERE A BIT ROUGHER ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MIND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT USING UP PERSONNEL AND SORTING OUT MY NEVAR I MEAN OUR STANCE WAS WOULD ALWAYS BE TREAT PEOPLE AS THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED YOU DON'T PRE CONCEIVE IT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FRENCH HAVE NOW BEEN A REALLY HIGH STATUS FOR WORDS FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEY HAVE HAD A CONCERT IT HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVITY
THEY CAN DO WITHOUT HEADACHES A CROWD DISORDER WHAT WE NEED IS THE FRENCH POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES TO BE CONCENTRATING ON LOOKING AFTER KEEPING EVERYONE SAFE AND NOT BEEN DISTRACTED BY HAVING TO DO WITH THE SWORD AND OBVIOUSLY BEING HELPED BY FANS BY PROPER FANS WHERE WHEREVER POSSIBLE ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK
WE'VE GOT TO SAY ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF FANS WHO HAD ACROSS FROM THIS COUNTRY A LAW ABIDING WE'RE WITH THE POLICE WE WOULD GIVE THE ADVICE WHO WOULD GIVE HERE IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF TERRORISM REPORT IT'S LOCAL POLICE IN FRANCE IN MASSIVE OPERATION TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND WE WANT OUR SUPPORTERS TO ENGAGE WITH THE FRENCH POLICE
