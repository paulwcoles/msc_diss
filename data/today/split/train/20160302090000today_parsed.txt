IT'S SIX O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SECOND OF MARCH GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH SARAH MONTAGUE AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE BOTH STRENGTHENED THEIR POSITION WITH A SERIES OF VICTORIES IN THE SUPER TUESDAY PRIMARY'S A GOVERNMENT REPORT HAS WARNED THAT ALL THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES TO E.U. MEMBERSHIP WOULD DAMAGE THE U.K.
ALSO ON TODAY'S PROGRAMME PIERS MORGAN WHO'S KNOWN DONALD TRUMP PERSONALLY FOR YEARS ON WHY THE BUSINESSMAN WOULD MAKE AN ASTUTE POLITICAL LEADER
TRUMP WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT DEAL MAKERS IN THE WORLD AND IF HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE VERY LEAST I WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY TO SEE HIM IN A ROOM WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN STRIKING A DEAL
SHOULD SCHOOLS BY TACKLING IN RUGBY AND IF THEY DO IS IT STILL RUGBY THE B.B.C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLS
THE BIGGEST DAY SO FAR OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE HAS SEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP CEMENT THEIR POSITIONS AS FRONTRUNNERS FOR THE PARTY'S NOMINATIONS THE LEADING DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN EACH ONE THE MAJORITY OF THE PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES HELD ON WHAT'S KNOWN AS SUPER TUESDAY BUT THEIR MAIN RIVALS ALSO SECURED VITAL VICTORY IS TO KEEP THEM IN THE CONTEST FROM A TRUMP RALLY IN FLORIDA HERE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOPER
THIS WAS A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP WHO MET REPORTERS LAST NIGHT HIS TONE WAS CONCILIATORY HE WAS QUIETLY SPOKEN HE SAID HE'D BE A UNIFIER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF THE NATION HE DIDN'T CROW AND HE DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE THE NOMINEE BUT HE CLEARLY THINKS THE PRIMARY RACE IS EFFECTIVELY OVER
THAT IS NOT HOW SENATOR TAKE CREW SEES IT AS WELL AS WINNING HIS HOME STATE OF TEXAS THE UNCOMPROMISING RIGHT WING SENATOR ONE IN OKLAHOMA TO AND CALLED ON THE OTHER CANDIDATES TO GET OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT IT BECOMES A HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE BETWEEN HIM OR MISTER TRUMP
FOR THE DEMOCRATS HILLARY CLINTON WON IMPRESSIVELY ACROSS THE SOUTH AND LIKE MISTER TRUMP SEEM TO BE LOOKING TO THE END OF HER PRIMARY BATTLE WITH SENATOR BIRNEY STARRED US ANTI NOVEMBER'S FIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENCY
NOTHING IS SETTLED BUT TRUMP VERSUS CLINTON SEEMS THE LIKELIEST MATCH
THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN A NEW ASSESSMENT OF THE DANGERS IT SAYS THAT YOU KAY WILL FACE IF IT LEAVES THE E.U. ONE IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE WEAKER AND LESS SAFE IT'S REPORT SETS OUT ALTERNATIVES TO E.U. MEMBERSHIP AND CONCLUDES THEY WOULD ALL BE DAMAGING THE CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO BACKS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED IT AS A DODGY DOSSIER HERE'S OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS
IT IS A CENTRAL QUESTION IN THIS REFERENDUM DEBATE WHAT WOULD BE THE PRACTICAL LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES IF BRITAIN VOTED TO LEAVE THE E. YOU AN ASSESSMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT HIS POSITION IS TO REMAIN IN THE UNION
WILL HIGHLIGHT WHAT PRO E.U. MINISTERS CONSIDER TO BE FLAWS IN THE ALTERNATIVES IT WILL STRESS THAT NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND TRADING ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE E.U. REQUIRE THEM TO MAKE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO ACCEPT THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE CANADA'S TRADE DEAL IT WILL ARGUE HAS TAKEN YEARS TO NEGOTIATE AND ACHIEVED ONLY LIMITED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
THOSE PUSHING TO LEAVE THE E. YOUSSEF THESE ARGUMENTS IGNORE THE FACT THE U.K. WOULD NEGOTIATE ITS OWN FREE TRADE ARRANGEMENT NOT COPY ONE SETTLED BY SMALL THEIR ECONOMIES
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PREPARING TO START SPENDING IT'S HUMANITARIAN AID MONEY IN GREASE TO HELP THE COUNTRY COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS UNDER THE PLANNED THE E.U. AID AGENCIES WOULD WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE U.N. AND OTHER CHARITIES CONTRIBUTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS
AIRLINE PILOTS ARE CALLING FOR TEST TO FIND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A DRONE HIT A PLANE FOLLOWING A SERIES OF NEAR COLLISIONS ACROSS THE U.K. THE BRITISH AIRLINE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION WANTS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SAFETY REGULATOR TO HELP FUND RESEARCH INTO THE CONSEQUENCES HERE'S OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESCOTT
A DRONE NEARLY HIT AN AIRCRAFT TWENTY THREE TIMES IN JUST SIX MONTHS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST U.K. FIGURES MANY PILOTS THINK IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ONE ACTUALLY STRIKES A PLANE YET NO ONE HAS ANY REAL IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT DID
THE AIRLINE PILOTS UNION BALPA SAYS IT'S POSSIBLE A DRONE COULD SMASH THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN SHOWERING THE CREW WITH GLASS OR EVEN CAUSE AND UN CONTAINED ENGINE FIRE WHICH COULD BRING DOWN THE AIRCRAFT IT'S NOW ASKING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SAFETY REGULATOR TO HELP PAY FOR TESTS TO SEE JUST HOW SERIOUS A DRONE STRIKE MIGHT BE
HEAD OF THE F.B.I. HAS ACCEPTED THAT FORCING APPLE TO UNLOCK AND I PHONE LINKED TO LAST YEAR'S TERROR ATTACK IN CALIFORNIA COULD SET A LEGAL PRECEDENT JAMES CO ME INSISTED THE TAPE COME METHOD NEEDED TO HACK INTO THE PHONE WOULD HAVE ONLY LIMITED USE IN OTHER CASES
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE U.K. COULD SAVE UP TO FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR ON ENERGY BILLS IF THERE WAS MORE INVESTMENT IN STORING ELECTRICITY ACCORDING TO A GLOBAL ADVISORY BODY THE CARBON TRUST SAYS BILLS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IF ELECTRICITY FROM WIND FARMS WERE STORED AT NIGHT WHEN DEMAND IS LOW TO BE USED AT PEAK PERIODS DURING THE DAY HERE'S OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER KARABIN
WHEN YOU'VE PAID TO BUILD A WIND FARM OR SODA ARRAY THE POWER THAT'S GENERATED IS VIRTUALLY FREE BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS COME WHEN IT'S WANTED SO THE REPORT RECOMMENDS A BIG INCREASE IN ENERGY STORAGE
IT SAYS ELECTRICITY CAN BE STORED BY MANY METHODS INCLUDING BATTERIES SPECIAL HYDRO POWER SYSTEMS GIANT VESSELS FILLED WITH COMPRESSED AIR AND TANKS BRIMMING WITH AIR CHILLED SO COLD THAT IT'S BECOME A LIQUID THE AUTHORS SAY THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT SAVE OVER TWO BILLION POUNDS ON OVERALL BILLS IN TWENTY THIRTY IF IT CHANGES POLICIES TO INCENTIVISE STORAGE
DOZENS OF DOCTORS AND ACADEMICS HAVE SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER CALLING FOR A BAN ON TACKLING DURING RUGBY MATCHES PLAYED IN U.K. AND IRISH SCHOOLS THEY SAY INJURIES CAN HAVE LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES RUGBY'S GOVERNING BODY THE R.F.U. SAYS IT TAKES SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY IT IS NOW SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND JOHN HAMMOND IS AT THE WEATHER CENTRE MORNING JOB
I JOHN SOME PRETTY DISRUPTIVE WEATHER OUT THERE FIRST UP THIS MORNING A PARTICULARLY ACROSS SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN ENGLAND AND NORTH WALES IT'S A WINTRY MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW THERE A MET OFFICE WARNINGS IN FORCE VERY HIT AND MISS CLUSTERS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS NOT RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE SOUTH OF NORTHERN IRELAND THE WESTERN END OF THE CENTRAL BAND OF SCOTLAND AND CROSSING PARTS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND
IT'S A FINE LINE BECAUSE IN THE HEAVIER BURSTS THE SNOW WILL FALL TO LOWER LEVELS GETTING RAPID ACCUMULATIONS BUT MOST OF THE ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL BE UP OVER THE HIGH GROUND BUT BE WARNED IT COULD BE QUITE DICEY FOR THE MORNING RUSH HOUR
IMPROVEMENT SO BY MID MORNING WITH SOME BRIGHTER INTERLUDES BEFORE MORE RAIN AND HILL SNOW SPREADING TO WESTERN SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND NORTHWEST ENGLAND LATER ON IN THE DAY IN BETWEEN IN THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE FOR THESE NORTHERN AREAS TEMPERATURES AROUND SIX OR SEVEN DEGREES
FOR WALES THE MIDLANDS EAST ANGLIA AND SOUTHERN ENGLAND THE WINTRY MIX FURTHER NORTH IS SWEEPING INTO PARTS OF WALES AND THE MIDLANDS RIGHT NOW AGAIN MOST OF THE SNOW UP OVER THE HIGHER GROUND IT'LL BE HEADING TO SOME SOUTHERN AND EASTERN COUNTIES BY LUNCH TIME SOME BRIEF ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW ESPECIALLY UP OVER THE HILLS

JOHN THANKS VERY MUCH IT'S SEVEN MINUTES PAST SUCCESS TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND PROMINENT IN ALL OF THEM IS THEIR PENSION STORY PENSIONS BOMBSHELL IN THE WORDS OF THE DAILY MIRROR WHICH IS THE NEWS YESTERDAY THAT THE FORMER HEAD OF THE C.B.I. JOHN CRADLE AND HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO CARRY OUT A TWELVE MONTH REVIEW INTO PENSIONS
TO DELIVER FAIRNESS THERE'S SOME OF THEM HAVE DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT NOW IT'S WORK TO SEVENTY FIVE IS THE HEADLINE IN THE MIRROR I WORKED EIGHTY ONE IS THE WARNING IN THE SUN AS THE SUGGESTION THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK AN AWFUL LOT LONGER IN THE DAILY MAIL'S HEADLINE PICKS UP ON THE FACT THAT ACTUALLY WHITE COLLAR STAFF WHITE COLLAR PENSIONS BLOW WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT TO RETIREMENT AGE IF YOU'RE A WHITE COLOUR UP CHOLERA A MANUAL WORKER THAT'S BECAUSE OF LIFE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT'S LINKED TO DIFFERENT JOBS
THE TIMES LEAVES WITH A STORY THAT SAYS ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE GOING TO SOAR IN PRICE AND THE PLANS BY BRUSSELS TO TAX THEM AT THE SAME PUNITIVE RAID AS TOBACCO THEY PING WILL BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH CIGARETTES AND CIGARS AS THE Y. U. CONSIDERS WAYS FOR GOVERNMENTS TO RAISE MORE MONEY AMID LOBBYING BY BIG PHARMA AND EXPERTS WHO SAY THAT A TAX RISE WILL DAMAGE PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE HIGHER PRICES WILL DISCOURAGE SMOKERS FROM SWITCHING TO BEEPING
AND ALL THE PAPERS PICK UP ON THE LATEST DISCOVERY OF WHAT FROM OUR GENES WHICH IS THAT THEY FOUND THE GENE THAT MAKES YOU GO GREY SO
WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DAFT CLUB HE DID ALL THE THINGS THAT THE MEDICAL SCIENCE COULD AND SHOULD BE DOING LIKE CURING CANCER AND THEY WORRY ABOUT GREY SEVENTY AND WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE'S A HUGE MARKET OFF THE BACK OF THIS WELL I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE BUT GOD CERTAINLY IN MY CASE I STARTED GOING GREY WHEN I WAS TWENTY EIGHT
SO APPARENTLY DID JENNIFER LOPEZ WHILE WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON A LOT BUT THE DRIVER IS NOW NINE MINUTES PLUS A STILL UP FOR YOU RESULTS TO COME IN FROM THE PRIMARIES ON SO CALLED SUPER TUESDAY BUT IT IS ALREADY CLEAR THE DONALD TRUMP IS THE BIG WINNER FOR THE REPUBLICANS NATALIE DID I WIN MOST OF THE STATES AND SOME ARE COMING IN AND HAVE EXPECTED TO WIN
BUT I CAME IN SECOND I CAME IN THE WORST IN SECOND SO WHAT'S IT LIKE I WON IN THEN I DISAPPEARED THE WORST I HAD WAS A SECOND SO I'M VERY VERY HONOURED BY THE TURNOUT DONALD TRUMP BEING AS MODEST AS EVER TED CRUISE DID MANAGED TO BEAT HIM IN TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA SO LONG AS THE FIELD REMAINS DEVICE
DONALD TRUMP'S PATH TO THE NOMINATION REMAINS MORE LIKE
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR REPUBLICANS FOR CONSERVATIVES AND FOR THEM
TONIGHT WE HAVE SEEN THAT OUR CAMPAIGN IS THE ONLY CAMPAIGN THAT HAS BEATEN THAT CAN BEAT AND THAT WILL BE DOWN
THAT WASN'T QUITE RIGHT THINGS CHANGED TO LITTLE BITS SINCE HE MADE THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE THE OTHER MAIN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE MARCO RUBIO DID WIN ONE OF THE PRIMARIES HE SAID HE'S NOT GIVING UP EVEN THOUGH YOU WON ONLY THAT ONE NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES
NO MATTER HOW MANY STATES ARE TAKES NO MATTER HOW MANY WEEKS AND MUDS AND TAKES I WORE CAMPAIGN AS LONG AS IT TAKES WHATEVER IT TAKES TO IT
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HILLARY CLINTON WAS OF COURSE THE BIG WINNER FOR THE DEMOCRATS SEVEN STATES OPPONENT BERNIE SANDERS ONE FOR MISSUS CLINTON CONGRATULATED HIM AND SAVAGE THE REPUBLICANS
AND I THE STAKES IN THIS SELECTION HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER
THE RHETORIC WE ARE HEARING AND THE OTHER SIDE HAS NEVER BEEN LOWER
TRYING TO DIVIDE AMERICA BETWEEN US AND THEM IS WRONG AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAD
WE LIKE IT OR NOT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER
HILLARY CLINTON AND OF COURSE WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ODD THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME INCLUDING A REPORT FROM OUR OWN MAN JIM WHO IS THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL DONALD TUSK WILL BE VISITING MACEDONIA AND CROATIA TODAY TO CONSIDER HOW TO RESOLVE THE MIGRANT CRISIS DANNY SAVAGE A CORRESPONDENT IS ON THE BORDER WITH GREECE AND DANNY WHAT CAN HE DO OR SAY THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
WELL HE HE'S TRYING TO PERSUADE THE OTHER BALKAN STATES ON THE MIGRANT TRAIL BUT TO IN A BETTER WAY TO TRY AND MAYBE MOVE SOME MORE PEOPLE ALONG THIS TRAIL AT THE MOMENT SOMETHING BY EIGHT AND A HALF THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE NOW BUILT UP
IN THIS BOTTLE NECK ON THE GREECE MACEDONIA BORDER THE BORDER GATORS HARDLY OPENED AT ALL I THINK IT OPENED AT ALL YESTERDAY AND IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO IT HAS AN OPEN VERY OFTEN WERE JUST A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE GETTING ACROSS AT TIMES SO THAT IS BUILDING UP TO WHAT'S THE UN IS DESCRIBING AS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
ON THE BRINK OF BEING ON A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT YOU TALK TO THE AID AGENCIES HERE AND THEY WOULD SAY THAT WE WERE ALREADY IN A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ON THE BORDER ON THEIR SITE IN THE FACT THAT CHILDREN ARE SLEEPING OUT IN THE OPEN WITHOUT ANY SHELTER AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SANITATION AT THE BORDER HAS BEEN PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO CAUSE IT AND THEY FEAR THAT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE THEY'LL SEE CHILDREN WITH MALNUTRITION ON A EUROPEAN BORDER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY ARE IN DESPAIR SO DONALD TUSK IS DOING THIS ROUND
OF TALKING TO BALKANS LEADERS TO TRY AND GET A BIT MORE CO OPERATION BECAUSE EVERY COUNTRY SEEMS TO BE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AT THE MOMENT ON ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH AND WE'VE ALSO HAD THE E.U. FLOATING A PLANNED TODAY SO OFFER EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID FOR WHAT'S GOING ON IT SAID THE COMMISSION PLANS TO ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS TO HELP ANY Y. YOU STAYS THAN THAT'S NOT ONLY GREECE
TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS NOW MONEY MAY HELP TO A CERTAIN POINT TO PROVIDE SHELTER AND BLANKETS AND THE BASICS BUT A LONGER TERM PLAN IS REALLY NEEDED BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL GUESS GOING TO HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVING IN TENTS IN THE BALKANS FOR THEIR FOR SABLE FUTURE BUT IT SEEMS THAT COUNTRIES NOT LEAST AUSTRIA MORE COUNTRIES ARE PUTTING UP BORDERS RATHER THAN TAKING THEM DOWN
IN AUSTRIA HAS REACTED TO THIS SUGGESTION OF A NEW PLAN AND YOU CO OPERATION BY SAYING THAT IT'S GOING TO STICK TO ITS DAILY LIMIT OF ALLOWING THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MIGRANTS TO TRANSIT THROUGH AUSTRIA TOWARDS GERMANY IT SAID IT DOES NOT WANT TO BECOME WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS AN OVERCROWDED WAITING ROOM FOR GERMANY AND IT HAS CONCERNS THAT GERMANY'S GOING TO THEN FILTER PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY QUITE CLOSELY LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT THEIR BACKGROUNDS
AND IF IT DOESN'T WANT LET THEM IN THEY'LL BE REJECTED BACK AUSTRIA AND IT'LL BE AUSTRIA'S PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE THAT GERMANY DOESN'T WANT SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THERE ALSO WE GET IT GETTING REPORTS THAT GREECE IS STARTING TO RETURN SOME MIGRANTS TO TURKEY THAT IT'S INTERCEPTING OUT ON THE ISLANDS HAD ON BOATS THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT HASN'T HAPPENED VERY MUCH AT ALL BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE JUST AS THIS FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE INTO GREECE
AND THEN THEY JUST HELP THE MIGRANT TRAIL BUT GREECE'S THEY'RE DEAD END AT THE MOMENT DANNY SAVAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUARTER PAST SIX THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT FIRM A STEP INTO THE DEBATE ON THIS COUNTRY'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOHN YES BLACK ROCK WHICH IS BY FAR THE WORLD'S BIGGEST ASSET MANAGER HE'S DEFINITELY NOT IN FAVOUR OF A BRECHT'S IT IN HER REPORT TITLED BIG RISK LITTLE REWARD IT SAYS A VOTE TO LEAVE WOULD LEAD TO LOWER U.K. GROWTH AND INVESTMENT HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT DAMAGE TO FINANCIAL SERVICES EVEN A STRAIN ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES THE NOTION THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE ABLE TO STRIKE A NEW TRADE DEALS ON ITS OWN OR SCRAP PILES OF Y. YOU RED TAPE IS IT SAYS
ILLUSORY GERARD LIONS AS CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO THE MAYOR OF LONDON HE'S PUBLISHED A REPORT SAYING THAT LONDON WOULD REMAIN A GLOBAL POWERHOUSE WHETHER WE STAY OR LEAVE THE EAT DUE HE JOINS ME NOW DOWN THE LINE JARRED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT BLACK ROCK IS SAYING AND WHAT YOU'RE
YOU ARE SAYING ALL YOUR REPORTERS SAYING APPEARS TO BE THAT YOU THINK THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE ABLE TO VERY VERY SWIFTLY SET UP TRADE TIES SO THE RECOVERY WOULD BE OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY RESULTING FOR BRECHT'S IT WOULD BE VERY VERY FAST AND THAT HE WAS NOT SHARED BY BLACK ROCK WELCOME MORNING YES WHAT THE REPORT THE TIGHTEST OF THE MAYOR OF LONDON IS A THREE HUNDRED PAGE REPORT
AND IT LOOKS AT LONDON FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE THE E.U. COMPONENTS OF THE REPORT IS ONLY A FEW PAGES BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST BUT THE KEY ISSUES THAT WHEN ONE LOOKS AT LONDON INTERNATIONAL POSITION TIP IN THE CASE OF THE Y. YOU'VE JUST ASKED ABOUT LONDON IS SO MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE THAN ANY OTHER FINANCIAL CENTRE IN EUROPE WITH ITS CONCENTRATION OF SKILLS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF TRADE DEALS ET-CETERA I'VE SAID MY SAY IN THE REPORT I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE
BUT IF THE U.K. WERE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION IT WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC SHOCK THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT'S PROBABLY LIKE A. LETTER LIKE A TICK AFTER THAT INITIAL SHOCK THE ECONOMY BUT RECOVER PROBABLY RECOVER QUITE STRONGLY BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IN THE INITIAL PHASE I THINK BLACKROCK CLEARLY TOUCHED ON THIS IN THEIR REPORTS THERE WAS UNCERTAINTY AHEAD OF A REFERENDUM AND CLEARLY UNCERTAINTY JUST AFTER THEY DO AND LONDON OF COURSE IS NOT THE SAME THING AS THE U.K.
THAT'S RIGHT THE REPORT I DID FOR THE MAYOR MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE TALK ABOUT FOR LONDON ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IN PARTICULAR THE NEED TO IMPRESSED IN THE FETE AND HAD MORE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING I THINK YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT CERTAINLY NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THE E.U. PUT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE GLOBAL PICTURE IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO POSITION THE HOLIDAY THE UNITED KINGDOM NOT JUST
THE LONDON TO BE VERY CLOSE VERY OUTWARD LOOKING AND INDEED IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE DEBATE ON THE RECENT WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS NOT EMBRACE THAT IDEAL TO BECOME MORTAL OPEN MORE OUTWARD LOOKING AS WELL THE BLACK REPORT ALSO SUGGEST THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE E.U. IF BRITAIN LEFT YOU SHARE THAT VIEW
WELL IN A NUTSHELL IT'S A SHOP FOR POST SIDE CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF THE E.U. WHEN ONE LOOKS AT IT THE U.K. IS ONE OF THE MAJOR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO THE E.U. IT'S ONE THAT THE E. USE STRONGER ECONOMIES IT ACCOUNTS FOR THE HALF THAT THE SCENT SPENDING OF THE E.U.
AND ALSO IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST EXPORT MARKETS FOR YOU SO IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MAJOR SHOCK FOR THE YEAR AS BLACKROCK THINK ON THEY YOU WOULD IMPLY THAT IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THAT MAKES GREAT SENSE FOR THE REST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DO SOME SORT OF DEAL WITH U.K. AFTER WE WERE TO VOTE TO LEAVE IF INDEED WE DID FOR ITALY
ALSO I THINK IT'S VITAL TO STRESS IF WE ACTUALLY GOT TO REFERENDUM WHERE THE COUNTRY VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. IT WILL BE LARGELY BECAUSE NOT JUST NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE E.U. BUT BECAUSE OF VISION WILL HAVE TO HAVE BEEN PAINTED BUT POINTS TO THE U.K. BEING ABLE TO DO WELL NOT JUST IN TERMS OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST BUT THINK LOCALLY AS WELL
THOSE WHO THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE POINT TO THE SAVINGS THAT BRITAIN WOULD MAKE MANY FIGURES HAVE BEEN SIGHTED BUT ONE OF THEM IS NINE BILLION LET'S STICK WITH THAT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A LARGE PART OF THE DEBATE I THINK IT'S PART OF YOU SHOULD BE STRESSED IF WE WERE TO LEAVE I THINK THE REGULATOR ISSUE IS LARGELY MINIMAL BECAUSE THE U.K.'S DEREGULATED MARKET BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE FINANCIAL SAVINGS
IF THE U.K. WERE TO LEAVE BUT MOST FINANCIAL SAVINGS NEED TO BE POSITIONED TO HELP ANY PARTS OF THE U.K. THAT HAVE SUFFERED IN TERMS OF THE INTERIM PAY TERMS OF THEIR LONDON REPORT I DID FOR THE MAYOR IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SAVING FROM LEAVING THE E.U. THAT LONDON REPORT LOOKS VERY MUCH AT THE FACT THAT HE'S TO U.K. POSITIONS ITSELF TO BE THINKING CLO PLEA AND AS HE SAID IN MONICA EARLIER QUESTIONS HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OR TRADE DEALS BUT THE REST THERE WE NEED TO
RELYING ON THE WIND STRENGTHS THERE'S A LOTTA WORK CLEARLY TO BE DONE OF COURSE CHILDLINE'S LINES THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED LET'S TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO OIL COMPANIES AND OIL PRICES AS IF GRAPPLING WITH PLUMMETING OIL PRICES WASN'T BAD ENOUGH FOR SHELL THE OIL GIANT IT'S NOW BEING SUED IN LONDON FOR THE SECOND TIME IN FIVE YEARS THIS OVER SPILLS IN THE NIGER DELTA NOW THE FIRST HEARING ON THESE NEW CLAIMS HE'S DUE AT TODAY'S
TODAY AT LONDON'S TECHNOLOGY AND CONSTRUCTION COURT AND IT WILL DETERMINE IF THE CLAIMANTS COULD LODGE A CASE AGAINST SHELLS NIGERIAN BUSINESS NOW TO COMMUNITIES ARE CLAIMING COMPENSATION THEY WANT SHELL TO CLEAN UP THEIR LAND ONE OF THEM SAYS THAT SPELLS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFFECTING ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND FARMLAND NOW THE CLAIMS COME AFTER SHELL AGREED A FIFTY FIVE MILLION SETTLEMENT IN JANUARY WITH RESIDENTS OF THE BUDDHA COMMUNITY IN THE NIGER DELTA
TO OIL SPILLS SHELF IT'S PART AS LONG MAINTAINED THAT PIPELINES IN THE AREA HAVE BEEN TARGETS FOR THIEVES THEY STEAL CRUDE OIL AND TRY TO REFINE IT LOCALLY THIS LEADS TO MORE SPELLS AND DAMAGE THROUGH EXPLOSIONS BUT MARTIN DAY WHO IS FROM LAW FIRM LEAD TODAY WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE TWO COMMUNITIES SAYS THE COMPANY SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT SOME OF THE OIL IS LIKELY TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THIRD PARTY WHAT THEY CALLED BUM CRANE BUT ALSO SOME HAS GONE DOWN TO BE A RISEN FROM THE FAILURE OF THE PIPELINES IN BOTH AREAS WHAT WE TRY AND SUGGEST IS THAT THERE ARE REASONABLE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE PIPELINE TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO TAP INTO TO SINK IT DOWN DEEP HAD TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOT THINGS LIKE A CONCRETE OVERCOAT TO AGAIN MAKE IT TOUGHER
BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE BUT WHEN THERE IS A BREACH OF THE PIPELINE THEY CAN QUICKLY NOW THAT AND CAN QUICKLY TURN OFF THE PIPELINE AND GET OUT THERE AND REPAIR IT BEFORE IT CAUSES TERRIBLE DAMAGE TO THE COMMUNITIES IN THE WAY THAT IT HAS SHELL FOR ITS PART AS TO KIND TO COME ON THE PROGRAMME IT SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT IT IS PART OF CLEAN UP OPERATIONS BUT THAT IT WOULD CONTEST ENGLISH
JURISDICTION OVER THE TWO CLAIMS BELIEVING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN LODGED IN NIGERIA LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ON THE MARKET CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF GAINS A MUCH MORE POSITIVE DAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING OF LATE ON TUESDAY JANE CINEMA IS INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT RATHBONE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SHE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU JOE COME ON AND JUST A COMMENT ON WHAT SHELL IS LOOKING OUT TODAY
IT'S IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OIL COMPANIES ARE FACING IT AND IT'S NOT CONFINED TO FALLING PRICES NO IT CERTAINLY ISN'T IT OF COURSE YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN CAST YOUR MIND BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH B.P. IN THEM CONDO DISASTER AS WELL THEY'RE ALL THERE ARE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES OIL COMPANIES OFTEN HAVE TO OPERATING DANGEROUS AND POLITICALLY DIFFICULT PLACES IT JUST JUST ADDS TO THE PUB WITH THE LIST OF PROBLEMS THEY'VE GOT O.K. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MARKET RISE YESTERDAY
WHAT IT IS IT THAT'S CHANGED IT APPEARED TO BE IN THE U.S. WE SAW SOME CONSTRUCTION DATA AT THE MANUFACTURING DATA WHICH SUDDENLY MAKE MADE INVESTORS THINK THAT A RATE RIVES WAS VERY MUCH ON THE TABLE
YES I KNEW S. YES THE OUTLOOK WELL MANUFACTURED BETTER CONSUMPTION DATA WAS A WAS A BIT BETTER I THINK IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE JUST HAD SO MUCH NEGATIVE NEWS MARKETS HAVE ADJUSTED TO IT AND THERE'S A THERE'S A SENSE THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT'S NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL THE RATE OF GROWTH IS STILL REASONABLE INFLATION IS STILL REASONABLE RATES ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO RISE VERY QUICKLY SO YOU KNOW SO PERHAPS THINGS AREN'T QUITE SO BAD AFTER ALL
MOODY'S HAS DOWNGRADED IT'S OUTLOOK ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT DEBT TO NEGATIVE OR OFTEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RATING AGENCIES THEY ARE SLOW TO REACT SO IT ARE THEY FASTER NOW CAN WE ASSUME THAT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED LAST WEEK SUCH THAT MADE HIS IS SAYING THIS NOW WELL I MEAN I THINK AGAIN I THINK WE KNOW THAT THINGS ARE DETERIORATING IN THE IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY I'M NOT SURE THAT
MOODY'S NECESSARY SO FRONT RUNNING THE SITUATION I THINK IT'S QUITE WELL PUBLICISED WE KNOW THAT CHINA IS TRYING TO RE ORIENT AWAY FROM FROM MANUFACTURING TO CONSUMER SPENDING AND THAT SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE OVER BORROWED ARE UNDER PRESSURE
JANE'S IN THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW U.K. PENSIONERS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO RISKS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW PENSION FREEDOMS THAT'S THE FINDING OF A TWO YEAR STUDY INTO THE CHANGES WHICH ALLOW PEOPLE GREATER FREEDOM OVER HOW TO INVEST OR SPEND THEIR PENSION POTS
THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF RETIREMENT INCOME SAYS THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE DEFAULT INVESTMENT OPTION AT RETIREMENT DAVID BLAKE IS CHAIR OF THE REVIEW HE'S WITH ME HERE IN THE STUDIO HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE PENSIONS INSTITUTE IT KATH'S BUSINESS SCHOOL AS WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AS YOU SEE IT IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW PEOPLE INVEST THEIR PENSION POT
YES I MEAN A GOOD SOLUTION REQUIRES FLEXIBLE ACCESS REQUIRES INVESTMENT RETURNS THAT BEAT INFLATION AND IT REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE LONGEVITY INSURANCE SO THAT YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF MONEY BEFORE BEFORE YOU DIE COULD WE NOT HAVE ALL OF THIS WITH THE WHEN WE WERE COMPELLED BY ANNUITIES OH YES THE IMMUNITY PROVIDED THAT PRODUCT BUT IT DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY FLEXIBILITY AT ALL WE'LL HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND SIMPLEST SOLUTION IT'S A DRAW DOWN
WITH A DEFERRED ANNUITY COMING IN AT THE AGE OF THE PHOTINIA SHE WOULD BE THAT YOU COULD PLAN TO BUY AN ANNUITY WITH MONEY LEFT IN FOR EXAMPLE FIVE OR TEN YEARS' TIME SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THEY'RE NOT ON THE MARKET NO THAT'S THE PROBLEM DEFERRED ANNUITIES DO NOT EXIST THEY'RE NOT ON THE MARKET IT'S A MARKET FAILURE AND THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO TRY AND PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT THAT THAT DEALT WITH THAT MARK THAT MARKET DIFFICULT AREA ISN'T IT THERE YOU HAVE A PENSION POT
ANYBODY WHO OFFERS ADVICE THAT'S A THAT'S A CLEARLY A VERY DIFFICULT AREA IT'S A REGULATED AREA THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GUIDANCE AND ADVICE THE PENSIONS WISE DOES GUIDANCE TOUCH SIMPLY PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT AND THEN YEARS HE IS WHAT DRAW DOWN IS IT DOESN'T REALLY TELL YOU WHAT COMBINATION YOU NEED OR OR THE BEST CONFIGURATION
THE NEXT STAGE IS TO GO TO ADVICE THAT'S THE FULLY REGULATED ACTIVITY IT WILL REQUIRE A RECOMMENDATION ON THE PERSON GIVING THAT RECOMMENDATION THE ADVICE WE COULD GET SUED IF THEY IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR ADVICE MEDDLERS NOTHING'S ALSO VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE PART WITH THE COURSE OF OUR NEEDS IT'S GOING TO BE DURING RETIREMENT NOBODY CAN KNOW THAT CAN THEY
THEY CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHICH IS WHY THE FLEXIBILITY IS VALUABLE BUT YOU CERTAINLY DO KNOW THAT YOU WANT THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE ON YOUR FUNDS TO BEAT INFLATION AND YOU ALSO KNOW THAT YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN OUT OF MONEY BEFORE BEFORE YOU DIE SO YOU DO LEARN CERTAIN THINGS AND WE CAN PUT IN PLACE A SIMPLE DE FAULT PRODUCT THAT DEALS WITH THOSE THINGS AS WELL AS GIVING IN THE FLEXIBILITY WORK IN PROGRESS DAVID BLAKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

BIG BIG WINS IN GEORGIAN TENNESSEE IN MASSACHUSETTS FOR MONT ALABAMA FOR JENNY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND IN ALABAMA TED CRUISE HIS CONSERVATIVE OPPONENT PICK UP HIS OWN
SEAT OF TEXAS IS ON STATE OF TEXAS WHICH EVERYONE EXPECTED GOT OKLAHOMA NEXT DOOR MARK OR RUBY OR HAD A DREADFUL NIGHT OF FLORIDA SENATOR BUT MANAGED TO SQUEAK HOME WHEN THE MINNESOTA CAUCUSES WHICH GAVE HIM A KIND OF FIG LEAF REALLY FOR THE NIGHT HILLARY CLINTON SEVEN SEVEN WHEN'S MCBURNEY SANDERS YOU KNOW WHO'S INSURGENCY IS NOT A SPECTACULAR TRUMPS BUT IT'S NONETHELESS THERE WALKED AWAY WITH HIS OWN STATE OF A MARK WHICH EVERYONE EXPECTED BUT PICKED UP COLORADO OKLAHOMA MINNESOTA'S WELL NOW
WHAT THIS MEANS IN THE END IS THAT IT'S NOT OVER THE DELEGATE COUNT GOES ON UNTIL THE CONVENTION TO THIS YOU KNOW IN THE SUMMER WITH A NOMINEE WILL BE CHOSEN BUT IT IS NOW OVER WELL MAINLY LIKELY THAT THE AUTUMN CAMPAIGN WILL FEATURE DONALD TRUMP
AND HILLARY CLINTON AND CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SAME THAT SENTENCE SIX MONTHS TALKING TO OLD HANDS AROUND THIS TIME IN WASHINGTON NOW HAVING BEEN IN VIRGINIA EARLIER IN THE DAY BUT OLD HANS HERE D'YOU SEE IT LOOK
YOU KNOW EVERY ELECTION IS DIFFERENT THERE'S SOMETHING NEW EVERY TIME BUT THIS IS REMARKABLE AND DONALD TRUMP DECLARED AND HE KEEPS CALLING THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STEPS OF NEEDLESS TO SAY THE TRUMPED YOU YORK AND HE SAID IT WAS LIKE GETTING AN OSCAR AND HE ANNOUNCED IN JUNE AND HALF HIS PARTY LAUGHED ESPECIALLY ON CAPITOL HILL THEY'RE NOT LAUGHING NOW
HE HASN'T GOT MORE THAN ONE SENATOR WHO SUPPORTS AND JEFF SESSIONS FROM ALABAMA WAS A HARDLINER IMMIGRATION TED CRUISERS GOT NONE AND THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT THE PARTY IS
SORT OF DEEPLY SPLIT ABOUT THE TRUMP PHENOMENON HE'S CREATED THIS EXTRAORDINARY MOVEMENT HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT TO VOTE BY PRIMARY STANDARDS HE'S IN COMMAND AND THE REST OF THEM DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT I SHOULD SAY JOHN THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THE LONG NIGHT HERE WHICH STILL GOES ON THE COUNTING IN ALASKA STILL
IN WASHINGTON IS THE VENOM THAT BECAME PUBLIC
WHEN TED CRUISE GAVE HIS SPEECH NOT LONG AFTER DONALD TRUMP HAD DONE A SORT OF VICTORY ROMP IN FLORIDA HILLARY CLINTON WAS JUST DOWN THE ROAD THE BALLS AND FLORIDA BIG PRIMARY THERE IN TWO WEEKS' TIME AND TED CREW SAID THE MAN WOULD BE A DISASTER HE SAID HE USED THE WORD CORRUPTION TO DESCRIBE HIS PART PUBLIC LIFE HE SAID
HIS SPEECHES WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN TO HEAR BECAUSE OF THE COARSENESS AND VULGARITY OF HIS LANGUAGE I MEAN THIS REALLY IS DEEPLY PERSONAL
IT MEANS IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY UGLY CAMPAIGN AND DOES IT MEAN SORT OF THE END OF PARTY POLITICS AS WE'D KNOWN IT WELL IT MEANS THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM THE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY ON CAPITOL HILL I DON'T LIKE THE WORD ESTABLISHMENT THERE BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS IT IS IT THE CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN THE COUNTRY OR IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE PARTY AND CAPITOL HILL ANYWAY THE PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL MITCH MCCONNELL IN THE SENATE
AND PAUL RYAN IN THE HOUSE AND HE CAN'T BEAR DONALD TRUMP OR
TED CREDITS I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A STATE SECRET THEY LOATH
LYNSEY GRAHAM THE SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA MADE A JOKE THE OTHER DAY JOKE WOULD YOU CALL IT THAT SING THAT HAVE TED CREWS WERE MURDERED ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH SENATORS AROUND TO ADMIT BEING THERE TO INDICT THE PERSON WHO DID IT NOW IF THAT'S REGARDED AS A FUNNY AND NICE LITTLE KIND OF HAPPY
TOOK STORY TO TELL TWO DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION WELL YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU'VE HAD THAT BEFORE SO IT'S DEEPLY BETTER ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE NOW ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IT'S MORE NORMAL IN A SENSE I MEAN BERNIE SANDERS HE'S
HE'S DOING A GREAT INSURGENCY FROM THE LEFT AND HILLARY CLINTON IS HAVING TO FIGHT VERY HARD BUT IT'S POLITE IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY HILLARY CLINTON SAYING SET OF SOUND AS A FORT AND HONOURABLE CAMPAIGN AND SO ON ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE I'M AFRAID NO HOLDS BARRED AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET WORSE WELL TRUMP CALLED HILLARY CLINTON A CRIMINAL SHE SAID SHE REGRETTED THE TONE OF THE CAMPAIGN
AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE AT THIS FOR NINE MONTHS WELL IT IS NOT UNTIL NOVEMBER IS IT A LAST WORK GOT QUICK NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW I MEAN THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY TRUMP IS GOING TO BE DISASTER WAS A NOMINEE BECAUSE THE PARTY WILL FALL APART THE PLENTY DEMOCRATS WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL
THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE AS IT WERE JOINED HIS MOVEMENT AND VOTED FOR HIM TONIGHT OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE PAST NOBODY WOULD PUT A PENNY AT THIS STAGE ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION IN NOVEMBER WELL WE'LL HEAR YOUR FULL REPORT AT TEN PAST EIGHT THANKS JIM TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE'S ANOTHER PAPER FROM THE GOVERNMENT TODAY ABOUT EUROPE THIS ONE ARGUING THAT ALL ALTERNATIVES TO E.U. MEMBERSHIP WILL HARM BRITTEN NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR
AND NORMALLY WHAT LOOKS AT OTHER COUNTRIES ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE E.U. TO SEE WHAT OUTTA MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT'S SIX TO ANSWER WHAT REMAINS ONE OF THE GREAT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS WHAT WOOD OUT B. FOR BRITAIN AND THE GOVERNMENT TODAY CONCLUDES NOT VERY PALATABLE CERTAINLY NOT PREFERABLE TO REMAINING IN THE E.U. SO YES IT SETS OUT WHAT IT SEES AS THE OPTIONS OPTION ONE WOULD BE TO HAVE A NORWAY ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS SORT OF THE CLOSE NON E.U. ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY THEY DO STILL GET ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET
BUT AT A PRICE ON THAT PRICES THEY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE IN AND CRUCIALLY SIGN UP TO FREE MOVEMENT WHICH MEANS IF WE DID THAT WE WOULD STILL HAVE NO CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS IN TERMS OF E.U. MIGRATION OPTION TWO IS THE SWISS OPTION SLIGHTLY LIMITED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE SECTOR WHICH OF COURSE IS CRITICAL TO THE BRITISH ECONOMY OPTION THREE YOU GO FOR CANADA WHICH TRIES TO NEGOTIATED SAME SORT OF DEAL
STILL NEGOTIATING IT AFTER SEVEN YEARS BEGINNING TO FACE PARIS OR LASTLY YOU GO FOR A SORT OF WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION AGREEMENT WHERE YOU COULD PLACE VERY SIGNIFICANT TARRA SOLVE THE GOVERNMENT SAY UP TO FIFTY PERCENT ON SOME FOODSTUFFS WHICH IT TRANSLATES AS MEANING THAT BRITISH SHOPPERS GROCERY BILLS WOULD GO UP IF WE LEFT THE E.U. AND HAD THAT SORT OF DEAL AS CUSTOMERS SORT AS ACCOMPANIST TO PASS ON THEIR COSTS IAIN DUNCAN SMITH THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IN THERE LEAVE CAMPAIGN SAYS IT'S A DODGY DOSSIER
YUP THE LANGUAGE GETS EVER MORE INFLAMMATORY THE LEE SIDE ARGUE THAT THIS IS ALL STUFF AND NONSENSE THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ITS OWN SPECIFIC U.K. DEAL AND THAT NONE OF THE OPTION SET OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT IS RELEVANT IT BOASTS TODAY NORMAN LAMONT'S COMING ON BOARD ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CONSERVATIVE FIGURE TO SET ALONGSIDE MICHAEL GO MICHAEL HOWARD OR NIGEL LAWSON
A METHOD OF YOU LIKE TO BUILD CREDIBILITY ON THEIR SIDE I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE WHERE WE ARE SARAH IT IS YOU KNOW WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE RUSHING OUT AND GRABBING THESE DOSSIERS OFF THE TOP SHELF YOU KNOW MULLING OVER THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA ON THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION THE POINT ABOUT THEM IS TO CREATE
A CLIMATE OF RISK OF UNCERTAINTY TO RAISE WHAT THE CHANCELLOR CALLS SERIOUS QUESTION MARKS ABOUT WHAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THAT IS A COMPLETE COPY CAT OF THE SCOTTISH PLAY BOOK WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAD EXACTLY THE SAME RAISING SERIOUS QUESTIONS DURING THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE POUND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND ALSO ACTUALLY PRODUCING SIMILAR DOCUMENTS AND MY SENSES THEY HAVE PICKED UP THE SCOTTISH PLAY BOOK AND THOUGHT IT WORKED THERE
IT CAN WORK IN THE EUROPEAN REFERENDUM TO YOU I WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT IT TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND AT TEN TO EIGHT NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY TO SEVEN LOWER PENSIONS AND TAXES ARE THE MAIN TOPICS FOR THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPERS THIS MORNING THE MAIL THE MIRROR THE SUN THEY ALL LEAD ON THE NEW INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE STATE PENSION AGE
THE MAIL SAYS WHITE COLLAR STAFF MAY HAVE TO WAIT LONGER FOR THEIR PENSIONS THAN MANUAL WORKERS SAYS THE REVIEWERS TO EXAMINE THE IDEA OF ALLOWING THOSE WHO START WORK AT SIXTEEN THE CLAIM FOR A PENSION AT A LOWER AGE AND GRADUATES WHO DURING THE LABOUR FORCE IN THEIR TWENTIES ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO FAVOUR PEOPLE LIVING IN AREAS OF LOW LIFE EXPECTANCY BECAUSE THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO CLAIM FOR AS LONG
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MORE AFFLUENT AREAS ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH THE CHANCE IS UNDER PRESSURE TO CUT INCOME TAX IN THE BUDGET LATER THIS MONTH AFTER REVEALING THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE TOP FIFTY PENCE RATE RAISED AN EXTRA EIGHT BILLION POUNDS FAR MORE THAN OFFICIAL FORECASTS
CONSERVATIVE M.P.S ARE NOW DEMANDING THE GOVERNMENT SEIZE THE CHANCE TO CUT TAX WHICH THEY BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO MORE REVENUE BEING COLLECTED AS PEOPLE STOP AVOIDING PAYMENT THE TERM SUPPOSED THAT E. CIGARETTE PRICES COULD SOAR UNDER PLANS BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO TAX THEM AT THE SAME RATE AS TOBACCO IT'S BEEPING WILL BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH CIGARETTES AND CIGARS AS A WAY FOR GOVERNMENTS TO RAISE MORE MONEY BUT
THE TIMES SAYS EXPERTS ARGUE THAT ATTACKS RISE WILL DAMAGE PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE HIGHER PRICES WILL DISCOURAGE SMOKERS FROM SWITCHING TO RAPING FOR ITS LEAD THE INDEPENDENT SAYS BRITAIN'S LARGEST DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED
PROFITEERING ON THE BACK OF THE HOUSING CRISIS BY RESTRICTING THEIR SUPPLY OF NEW HOMES TO KEEP PRICES UNNECESSARILY HIGH THE LATEST FIGURES SHOW THAT RECORD HALF A MILLION HOMES IN ENGLAND HAVE PLANNING PERMISSION BUT ARE YET TO BE BUILT ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT E. HOME BUILDERS FEDERATION TELLS PAPER IT BLAMES THE PLANNING SYSTEM FOR THE SHORTFALL IN HOUSES
THE SUN LEADS IT SPORTS PAGES WITH THE NEWS THAT ENGLISH FOOTBALL'S FIVE BIGGEST CLUBS HELD SECRET TALKS WITH THE AMERICAN BILLIONAIRE STEPHEN ROSS IN LONDON YESTERDAY ABOUT BREAKING AWAY FROM THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE UNDER THE PLANET SAYS MANCHESTER UNITED CHELSEA ARSENAL MANCHESTER CITY AND LIVERPOOL WOULD JOIN WITH EUROPE'S OTHER TOP CLUBS TO FORM A EUROPEAN SUPER LEAGUE
PAPER SAYS THEY WANT TO CUT OUT THE RISKS OF MISSING OUT ON MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF INCOME EVERY TIME THEY FAILED TO QUALIFY FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IN A MOVE THAT WOULD SPELL THE END OF THE UEFA COMPETITION AND FINALLY JULIAN LEWIS HAS BEEN NAMED AS THE ONLY M.P. WHO DOESN'T COMMUNICATE WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS BY EMAIL THERE SOME QUOTES DOCTOR LEWIS IS CHAIRMAN OF THE DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE ARE SAYING HE REGARDS CORRESPONDENTS BY EMAIL AS INSECURE AND UNSATISFACTORY
A SPOKESMAN FOR DOCTOR LEWIS IS CONSERVATIVE M.P. FOR NEW FOREST EAST TELLS THE TIMES THAT CONSTITUENTS CAN COMMUNICATE BY LETTER OR FAX OR SEE HIM AT HIS SURGERIES ONE CONSTITUENT TELLS THE PAPER NEW DAY IT IS TOO OLD FASHIONED NOT TO COMMUNICATE ONLINE EVERYONE IS NOW ON THE INTERNET ON SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO SEVER THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE CEMENTED THEIR POSITIONS AS THE FRONT RUNNERS IN THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE WITH STRONG SHOWINGS OF THE SUPER TUESDAY SERIES OF PRIMARY ELECTIONS
SERIOUS SOBER AND PRINCIPLED THAT'S HOW GEORGE OSBORNE DESCRIBED A TREASURY DOCUMENT THAT WILL SET OUT THE PROS AND CONS OF THE U.K.'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE CHANCELLOR TOLD THE COMMONS THAT THE ANALYSIS WILL BE PUBLISHED BEFORE THE REFERENDUM INJI HERE'S OUR CORRESPONDENT SEAN
GEORGE OSBORNE SAID HE WANTED TO SET OUT A POSITIVE CASE THAT THE U.K. WOULD BE STRONGER SAFER AND BETTER OFF IF IT STAYED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT A U.K. EXIT FROM THE E.U. WOULD BE A LONG COSTLY A MESSY DIVORCE AND HE SAID HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT THAT THE FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS OF THE G. TWENTY CONCLUDED AT THE WEEKEND THERE A BRITISH EXIT WERE CAUSING ECONOMIC SHOCK NOT JUST FOR THE U.K. BUT TO EUROPE AND THE WORLD
THIS DIDN'T IMPRESS MANY OF THE CONSERVATIVES SITTING BEHIND THE CHANCELLOR THIS WAS THE LEADING EUROSCEPTIC STEVE BAKER ISN'T IT EXTRAORDINARY THAT THE CHANCELLOR ASKED THE G. TWENTY TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT AND ISN'T IT THAT CASE THAT HE DID IN FACT MAKE THE REQUEST TO THEM IN ORDER THAT THEY COULD TEE OFF THIS ELEMENT OF PROJECTS
MISTER OSBORNE SAID THE FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANKERS WERE ONLY SAYING WHAT EVERY MAJOR INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC INSTITUTION HAD SAID THE IDEA THAT THE U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE HEAD OF THE I.M.F. OR INDEED THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR OF CHINA DANCES TO A BRITISH JUNE I'M AFRAID IS A BIT FANCIFUL
BUT ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE JACOB REES MOGG WAS PUZZLED BEFORE LAST MONTH'S RENEGOTIATION DAVID CAMERON HAD MAINTAINED HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT LEAVING THE Y. YOU IF YOU DIDN'T GET THE RIGHT DEAL
MY RIGHT HONOURABLE FRIENDS RATHER UPPER COLETTE TOOK VIEW OF OUR LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IS CORRECT
WAS IT NOT BOTH EITHER IRRESPONSIBLE OR IN ACCURATE OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO SAY NOTHING OUT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MOST UNSATISFACTORY RENEGOTIATION
GEORGE OSBORNE DEFENDED THE PRIME MINISTER'S DEAL AND HE AVOIDED ANY PERSONAL REMARKS HE ACCEPTED THAT PEOPLE HAVE PERFECTLY HONOURABLE REASONS FOR LEAVING THE E. U. THERE'S A HEALTHY DEBATE ACROSS A POLITICAL SYSTEM AS WELL AS A COUNTRY BUT I TAKE THE RONALD REAGAN ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT WHICH IS I WON'T SPEAK ILL OF A CONSERVATIVE
A FEW MINUTES LATER A CONSERVATIVE M.P. INVITED THE TREASURY MINISTER GREG HANDS TO COMMENT ON THE NEWS THAT THE GREEK FORMER FINANCE MINISTER JAN US FARAH FUCKERS WHO CALLS HIMSELF AN ERRATIC MARXIST WAS ADVISING THE LABOUR PARTY
AND IN TERMS OF ANY EXTERNAL DEVICES TAKEN ON BY THE PARTY OPPOSITE MY SPEAKER I AM QUITE CLEAR AND IT WOULD APPEAR FROM THIS MORNING'S SUN THAT LABOUR M.P.S ARE EXTREMELY UNHAPPY IT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME LONG WINDED BORING AND UNNECESSARY JOHN MCVIE
THESE EXCHANGES TOOK PLACE DURING THE LATEST SESSION OF TREASURY QUESTIONS IT WAS THE FIRST ITEM ON THE PARLIAMENTARY TIMETABLE A TRICKY TIME OF THE DAY WHEN TEMPERS CAN FRAY BREAKFAST IS A FADING MEMORY LUNCH IS STILL SOME WAY OFF LABOUR'S SHADOW CHANCELLOR JOHN MCDONNELL SAID THAT LAST NOVEMBER GEORGE OSBORNE HAD BOASTED OF HAVING AN ECONOMIC PLAN THAT PRODUCED BETTER RESULTS THAN WERE FORECAST
SINCE THEN WE'VE SEEN BUSINESS INVESTMENT FOR HIS EXPORT TARGET RECEDE INTO THE DISTANCE TRADE DEFICIT WIDEN MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION ENTER RECESSION THE PRODUCTIVITY GAP THE BIGGEST IT'S BEEN FOR A GENERATION
AND LAST WEEK THE CHANCE NOW TO CROWN IT ALL TELLS US THE ECONOMY SMALL THEN WE THOUGHT CAN I SAY TO HIM IF HE'S ECONOMIC PLAN IS NOW PRODUCING WORSE RESULTS
IMPOSING MORE STEALTH TAXES
THE BUDGET WE NEED MATTERS WORSE THANK YOU WE NEED A QUESTION MARK ORDER ORDER
I SAID WHAT I SAID BECAUSE MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANSWERING FOR GOVERNMENT POLICY NOT THAT OF THE OPPOSITION AND PEOPLE WHO ASK QUESTIONS BE THEY FROM THE FRONT OR THE BACK BENCH MY EPIPHANY THIS HE REPLIED TO SECRETARY
GREG HAND PUT HIS BEST PISS FORWARD AND SAID THE U.K. ECONOMY WAS STILL PERFORMING EXTREMELY WELL
AND OF COURSE THE CHANCELLOR WAS RIGHT TO SAY OVER THE WEEKEND THAT WE MAY NEED TO UNDERTAKE FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY CAN ONLY AFFORD WHAT HE CAN AFFORD
NOW THESE SESSIONS MAYBE PARLIAMENTARY THEATRE BUT THE SCRIPT IS HARDLY NOEL COWARD WHEN THE SHADOW CHANCELLOR ASKED ANOTHER QUESTION A CONSERVATIVE SHOUTED OUT SHUT UP YOUR FACE ONCE AGAIN IT WAS GREG HANDS WHO REPLIED BUT ALMOST AS SOON AS HE SAID THE WORDS THE LABOUR PARTY THE SPEAKER TOLD HIM TO SIT DOWN
SO IT WAS A SURPRISE WHEN JOHN BERCOW ALLOWED GEORGE OSBORNE TO MOCK LABOUR FOR GETTING ADVICE FROM YOU HONEST VIRAL FLACCUS AND THE FORMER ECONOMICS EDITOR FOR CHANNEL FOUR NEWS PAUL MASON PRESUMING THEY CHASED THIS TEAR BECAUSE CHAIRMAN MAO WAS DEAD A MICKEY MOUSE WAS BUSY
HOW DID HE GET AWAY WITH THAT PRESUMABLY THAT WAS PITHY ENOUGH FOR THE SPEAKER
SURE CARROON REPORTING THERE MORE ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE IT ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE EMERGED AS THE CLEAR WINNERS OF SUPER TUESDAY THE BIGGEST DAY OF VOTING SO FAR IN THE RACE TO BECOME EACH OF THEIR PARTY'S CANDIDATES FOR NOVEMBER'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
BEFORE WE GET SOME ANALYSIS OF THAT HERE'S A REMINDER ABOUT THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT DONALD TRUMP MIGHT RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IT WAS ON THIS PROGRAMME MY TRUMP SPOKE TO JUSTIN ABOUT THE RYDER CUP BACK IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN AND HE ALSO SAID HE WAS THINKING ABOUT STANDING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN I DO AT THAT POINT IT SEEMED ALMOST A TOSS UP BETWEEN THAT AND MAKING THE MOST OF HIS GOLF RESORT AT TURNBERRY
THERE OH ROB ME CAN DO IT A LOT OF POLES WANT ME YOU THINK THAT I LOVE WHAT I'M DOING I LOVE PICKING CIARAN WE'RE GOING TO MAKE KEPT UPPING THE SCOTLAND
HE COULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU I LOVE DOING BUT HORRIBLY INDICATE THAT THEY SHOULD ADD ANOTHER LEAD OUR COUNTRY'S NOT DOING WELL
MADE BY PEOPLE GOING TO BREED CARPET IT SO THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WILL SEE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION NEXT TIME ROUND WHAT IT ALWAYS APART ABILITY EDITORIAL PART ABILITY ABSOLUTELY YEAH I DON'T SEE THE RIGHT PERSON AND
TO BE MADE AND IF I DON'T SEE THE RIGHT PERSON THAT'S RUNNING AND IF THE COUNTRY CONTINUES TO DO POORLY THEY WERE CERTAINLY
YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST THAT WAS BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WILL OF COURSE DONALD TRUMP EMERGED AS A CLEAR WINNER OF SUPER TUESDAY BLUNT'S IS A POLITICAL CONSULTANT AND REPUBLICAN PARTY STRATEGIST LITTLE EARLY THIS MORNING I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS
TONIGHT WAS AN IMPORTANT NIGHT ON BALL SIGHTS TONIGHT ALLOWED HILLARY CLINTON SAY THAT NOT ONLY IS SHE THE FRONT RUNNER BUT THAT'S
PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE FOR THE DEMOCRATS SHE DID WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CLAIM THAT AND ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHY
ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S OPPONENTS DID WIN TUESDAY STAGE WE COULD STILL NOW WIN A THIRD HE WON SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE DELEGATES THERE OR UP TONIGHT DAD HE BECOMES CLEARLY THE FRONT RUNNER AND IT'S HARD TO SEE ANYONE KNOCKING HIM OFF AT THIS POINT AND ALL YOUR ANALYSIS FROM PETE SPEAKING TO PEOPLE DO YOU THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD SAY O.K. WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS LET'S UNITE AROUND HIM
I WOULD CHALLENGE WITHIN THE G.O.P. IT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT I'D LISTENED IN ON SOME COURSE FRANKLY SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE EMBARRASSING AS THEY WERE DISCUSSING WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO TO NOT TRUMP OFF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO
THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE U.S. THAT SUPPORTS THE REPUBLICANS AS BEEN DEFEATED AND TONIGHT WAS THE LAST BATTLE
AND WHILE IT IS UNCLEAR THAT THAT TUNNEL TROUBLE WHEN EVERY PRIME AND EVERY COP IS GOING FOR HIS ADVANTAGE IS SO GREAT RIGHT NOW THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS IS TOO LITTLE IT'S TOO LATE AND IN FACT THEY CAN END UP HELPING TO TO DEMOCRAT IF THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR OPPOSITION WHAT DO YOU MEAN EMBARRASSING WHAT SORT OF THINGS WERE YOU HEARING
IT'S EMBARRASSING BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY I REALISED THAT TO BRITISH ARMY STYLE TRUMPET EXTREME I REALISE THAT HE IS TO MANY A JOKE
BUT THERE IS THIS SEGMENT OF AMERICANS WOULD SAY THAT HE'S SO ANGRY AND SO FRUSTRATED AND THE SENSITIVE BEEN BETRAYED BY THEIR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND CORPORATIONS AS WELL THAT THERE ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOST I CHANGE ORIENTED IF NOT A RADICAL CANDIDATE WAS GOING TO A MIRROR IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION
AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE DULL TRUMP ACTUAL LESTER'S AGREE BERNIE SANDERS IS EXACTLY THAT CAME WITH IT BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT THAT CANDIDATE NEEDS TO HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING AND CAN DONALD TRUMP BEAT HILLARY CLINTON
LET ME GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF HISTORY DONALD TRUMP SAID THAT MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS AND MURDERERS HE WENT UP IN THE POLLS HE SAID THAT A VERY FAMOUS U.S. SENATOR WHAT DOES A WAR HERE
TRIBE WENT UP IN THE POLLS HE ACCUSED ONE OF HIS OPPONENTS OF HAVING A HORRIBLE FACE IN A VOICE THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO GET HEADACHES HE WENT UP
EVERYTHING THE TOWN TRAMP HAS OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THAT WOULD HAVE DEFEATED ANY OTHER CANDIDATE
TIM AND HE'S GOT A SOLID THIRTY EIGHT OR FORTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY STATE THAT IS ENOUGH TO ELECT HIM IN A PRIME PRIMARILY
THIS BACKGROUND IS YOU CAN NOW COUNT HIM OUT THE VERY SAME PHENOMENA ARE NEVER ELECTED SOMEONE THERE'S ARGUABLY OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM FOR YOUR LABOUR PARTY IS THE SAME PHENOMENON THAT IS A LATIN JUNGLE TRUB AMONG REPUBLICANS
WHO KNOWS HE IS SURPRISED PEOPLE FOR THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS WHO WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD COUNT HIM OUT NOW SO YOUR ADVICE IN BRIEF TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD BE
GET USED TO IT YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT IT'S DRY FOG YOU DON'T PERFORM THE WAY VOTERS WHILE YOU TWO YOU DON'T LISTEN WELL ENOUGH YOU DON'T LEARN YOU DON'T RESPOND YOU ARE APT OF UNION JOE THE THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE ALL THAT DID YOU DO TO GET DONE AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH
FRANKLAND'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS NOW SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN PILOTS ARE GETTING REALLY WORRIED ABOUT GROANS HITTING THEIR AIRCRAFT AND THEY CALL HIM FOR TESTS TO BE CARRIED OUT TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECT WOULD BE IF THAT DID HAPPEN WILL STEPHEN IS THE FLIGHT SAFETY SPECIALIST AT THE BRITISH AIRLINES PILOTS' ASSOCIATION I'M SLIGHTLY SURPRISED YOU DON'T KNOW
WELL THE NUMBER OF DRAINS BEEN SOLD IN THE U.K. HAS GONE UP DRAMATICALLY WE'RE TALKING TENS OF THOUSANDS PER YEAR SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS AND THE PROBLEM WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT AS DRAINS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE PERFORMANCE CAPABLE AND GETTING HIGHER SO A FEW YEARS AGO DRAINS WE'VE RUN OUT OF PUFF AT A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET
NOW THEY CAN GET A TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND AND EVEN EIGHT THOUSAND FEET REALLY SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE MOMENT MOST THE DRONES ARE FLOWN IN A PERFECTLY SAFE AND SENSIBLE MANNER BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE WHO EITHER DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RULES OR THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES AND THEY'RE FLYING THEM IN APPROPRIATE AREAS AND GETTING TOO CLOSE TO AIRLINE AND HOW MANY NEAR MISSES IF THAT'S THE RIGHT EXPRESSION OTHER THAT THAT'S GONE UP MASSIVELY SO
WE'RE LOOKING AT MEN TWENTY THREE BUT THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING SOME FROM LAST YEAR SO WE COULD BE LOOKING AT SORT OF THIRTY NEAR MISSES LAST YEAR BUT THESE ARE THE ONES ONLY THE ONES HAVE BEEN SEEN SO
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE DAMAGE A DRONE WE CAUSE WHEN HIT AN AIRCRAFT COS IF IT JUST HIT THE FUSELAGE OF AN AIRCRAFT THE MAIN BIT OF IT PRESUMABLY THAT WOULD BE RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT WELL WE DON'T KNOW AND THAT'S WHY I WAS CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING INTO SOME SORT OF RESEARCH INTO IMPACT TESTING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING USING BIRD DATA AT THE MOMENT OUR BIRD TYPICALLY WASN'T GET SUCKED INTO THE ENGINE OR HITS HITS PART OF THE FUSELAGE STUFF WILL
BOUNCE OFF IT'LL DO SOME DAYLIGHT BECAUSE BIRDS DON'T HAVE THESE SOLID BATTERY PACKS WITH SHARP CORNERS SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THAT DRONE WILL DO WHAT DAMAGE THAT'LL DO HIT ANY PART OF THE AIRCRAFT IF IT GETS SUCKED INTO AN ENGINE WELL IF EVER DRONE THE TYPICAL DRAINS WITH SEEING BEEN SOLD IN LARGE NUMBERS WAY ABOUT A KILO TO A KILO AND A HALF
ONE OF THOSE GOES DOWN THE JET ENGINE THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT THAT ENGINE WILL STOP BUT THEN THAT HAPPENS ANYWAY IF THEY DEVELOP THAT LID SEAGULL GETS UP TIDDLERS I THINK EXACTLY BIRD STRUGGLE TO CAUSED THE ENGINE TO STOP NORMALLY BUT IT'S WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE CALLING FURTHER RESEARCH BECAUSE THIS BATTERY PACK TYPICALLY MADE OF LITHIUM WHICH DOESN'T REACT WELL TO HEAT
THAT GETS INTO THE CORE OF THE ENGINE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY LOTS OF HEIDI'S HIGH SPEED POT SPINNING AROUND AND IT'S VERY HOT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT WILL CAUSE SOMETHING CALLED CONTAINED ENGINE FAILURE WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY AN EXPLOSION AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES US BECAUSE IN THAT
THAT'S AN R. YOU END UP WITH BITS OF METAL FLYING AROUND A VERY HIGH SPEED AND THEY COULD PENETRATE FUEL TANKS HYDRAULIC LINES MAY ENTER THE CABIN AS ANY OF THOSE OR A SERIOUS EMERGENCIES A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT ISN'T IT AND IF IT HIT THE WINDSCREEN I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE EITHER WE DON'T AND THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT COS WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD DRAIN HITS A WINDSCREEN IT'LL BOUNCE OFF OR WHETHER IT'LL ACTUALLY PENETRATE THE COCKPIT NOW IF IT'S A REPENTANCE COP IT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT
PILOT INJURY AND THAT'S PUTTING THEIR LIVES IN DANGER OF ALL THE PASSENGERS SO IDEALLY WE WANT TO STOP THESE MID AIR COLLISIONS HAPPENING INTERESTING THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR FOR THE TEST TO BE CARRIED OUT ON THIS RATHER THAN SAYING WE WANT A BAN ON THESE THINGS WE DON'T ABANDON
MAJORITY DRONE USERS ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB IT'S A IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS HUGE POTENTIAL AND WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT BALPA IN BRITISH PILOTS WANT TO SEE THAT INDUSTRY GROWN WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING IT SENSIBLY IN THEY'VE DONE THE COURSES DONE THE TESTING AND THAT'S GREAT BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THAT MINORITY
BREAK THE RULE IN TANDEM TO THIS WE'RE WORKING ON EDUCATION PROGRAMME AND STOPPING THESE THESE DRINKS GETTING TO THE WRONG PLACE IN A SENTENCE SHOULD WE HAVE LICENCE SHALL WE HAVE TO HAVE LICENCES IF WE'RE GOING TO RUN THESE ROOMS TO OPERATE
YES I THINK WHAT ABOUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS PROPORTIONATE LICENSING SO IF YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK AND YOU'RE MIXING WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT YOU SHOULD BE LICENSED IF IT'S A TOY IT'S A TOY YOU DON'T NEED LICENSING BUT REGISTRATION LICENSING AND RESEARCH INTO THE IMPACT OF DRAINS ON AIRCRAFT STEVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THREE MINUTES TO SEVEN TIME FOR A WEATHER FORECAST AND JOHN HAMMOND IS HERE HELLO JOHN HELLO SARAH LOTS OF DISRUPTIVE WEATHER AS WELL I'M AFRAID THIS MORNING A MESSY MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW IT'S A FINE LINE IN ANY OF THE HEAVIER DOWNPOURS THE SNOW'S COMING DOWN TO QUITE LOW LEVELS NOTABLY ACROSS PARTS OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND NORTHERN ENGLAND

THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS IN THE RACE TO BECOME U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE CEMENTED THEIR POSITIONS WITH A SERIES OF VICTORIES IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS AND CAUCUSES ELEVEN STATES VOTED ON WHAT'S KNOWN AS SUPER TUESDAY WITH THE LEADING DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON AND THE REPUBLICAN BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP EACH CLAIMING SEVEN VICTORIES

THIS WAS A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP WHO MET REPORTERS LAST NIGHT HIS TONE WAS CONCILIATORY HE WAS QUIETLY SPOKEN HE DIDN'T CROW AND HE DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE THE NOMINEE BUT HE CLEARLY THINKS THE PRIMARY RACE IS EFFECTIVELY OVER AND TRY TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A FORCE FOR UNITY WE'VE DONE SOMETHING THAT ALMOST NOBODY THOUGHT COULD BE DONE
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF IT AND I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS I AM A UNIFIER I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER AND UNIFY AND WHEN WE UNIFY THERE'S NOBODY NOBODY THAT'S GOING TO BEAT US THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE

TO HELP IT COPE WITH WHAT THE UN HE'S CALLING A LOOMING HUMANITARIAN DISASTER BORDER RESTRICTIONS FURTHER NORTH HAVE CREATED A BACKLOG OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS ASSUMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN ATHENS WILL SOON NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME
SOME OF THE MONEY GREECE NEEDS CAN BE FOUND FROM EXISTING FUNDS BUT THE COMMISSION IS NOW PROPOSING THAT NEW HUMANITARIAN FUNDING SHOULD BE DEPLOYED IN THE SAME WAY THAT E.U. MONEY IS SPENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND IN CONFLICT ZONES THAT MEANS FOR THE FIRST TIME WORKING DIRECTLY WITH U.N. AGENCIES AND N.G.O.S INSIDE EUROPE RATHER THAN SIMPLY GIVING MONEY TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES LIKE GREECE
EVEN IF SUCH FUNDING CAN BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY THOUGH THE E.U. ALSO NEEDS TO STEM THE FLOW OF NEW ARRIVALS AND THAT MEANS BETTER CO OPERATION WITH TURKEY REMAINS ESSENTIAL
THE HEAD OF THE F.B.I. HAS ACCEPTED THAT FORCING APPLE TO UNLOCK AND I PHONE LINKED TO A TERROR ATTACK COULD SET A LEGAL PRECEDENT JAMES CO ME TOLD A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE THAT APPLES I PHONE ENCRYPTION WAS LIKE A VICIOUS GUARD DOG THAT STOPPED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM GATHERING EVIDENCE
THIS CASE IS NOT ABOUT THE F.B.I. IT'S NOT ABOUT APPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT CONGRESS IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN TRYING TO DO A CARPAL INVESTIGATION I'M GOING ACTIVE CASE THAT SAID OF COURSE ANY DECISION BY A JUDGE IN ANY FORM IS GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY PRESIDENTIAL
A LAWYER FOR APPLE BRUCE SAID THE COMPANY WAS BEING ASKED TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO HACK INTO DEVICES AROUND THE WORLD
THE F.B.I.'S ASKING UP ONTO TO WEAKEN THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS PACKERS AND CYBER CRIMINALS COULD USE THIS TO RECKON ALBERT ON OUR PRIVACY AND PERSONAL SAFETY IT WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR GOVERNMENT INTRUSION INTO THE PRIVACY AND SAFETY OF THE
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TRUST APPLE'S PRODUCTS WITH THE MOST INTIMATE DETAILS OF THEIR DAILY LIVES
PILOTS ARE CALLING FOR TESTS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A DRONE HITTER PLANE FOLLOWING A SERIES OF NEAR COLLISIONS ACROSS THE U.K. THE BRITISH AIRLINE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION WANTS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SAFETY REGULATOR TO HELP FUND RESEARCH INTO THE CONSEQUENCES MINISTERS WILL PUBLISH A STRATEGY ON THE USE OF DRONES LATER THIS YEAR HERE'S OUR TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT RICHARD WESTCOTT
A DRONE NEARLY HIT AN AIRCRAFT TWENTY THREE TIMES IN JUST SIX MONTHS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST U.K. FIGURES MANY PILOTS THINK IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ONE ACTUALLY STRIKES A PLANE YET NO ONE HAS ANY REAL IDEA WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT DID
THE AIRLINE PILOTS UNION BALPA SAYS IT'S POSSIBLE A DRONE COULD SMASH THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN SHOWERING THE CREW WITH GLASS OR EVEN CAUSE AND CONTAINED ENGINE FIRE WHICH COULD BRING DOWN THE AIRCRAFT IT'S NOW ASKING THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SAFETY REGULATOR TO HELP PAY FOR TESTS TO SEE JUST HOW SERIOUS A DRONE STRIKE MIGHT BE
MORE THAN SEVENTY DOCTORS ACADEMICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE U.K. AND IRELAND TO BE TACKLING IN RUGBY GAMES AND SCHOOLS THEY'VE WARNED THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SERIOUS INJURIES HERE'S OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT
THE RISKS OF PROFESSIONAL RUGBY ARE PLAIN TO SEE BUT DOCTORS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE TOLD THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. AND IRELAND THAT YOUNG PLAYERS ARE ESPECIALLY AT RISK THE GROUP WHICH INCLUDES EXPERTS IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS DESCRIBED RUGBY AS A HIGH IMPACT COLLISION SPORT WITH THE RISK OF FRACTURES TEARS TO LIGAMENTS AND SPINAL AND HEAD INJURIES THAT COULD HAVE LIFELONG AND LIFE ENDING CONSEQUENCES
THE GROUP SAID TACKLES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO THIRDS OF INJURIES IN YOUTH RUGBY AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONCUSSIONS AND CALLED FOR A MOVE TO TOUCH RUGBY THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION SAID IT'S EXPECTED SCHOOLS TO BE AWARE OF THE RISKS AND TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR PUPILS
THE U.S. ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY HAS RETURNED TO EARTH FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION HAVING SET A RECORD FOR THE LONGEST TIME IN SPACE BY AN AMERICAN HE SPENT THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS ON THE STATION THE WORLD RECORD IS HELD BY THE RUSSIAN COSMONAUT ON THE AIRY POLYP OFF WHO REMAINED ON BOARD THE MIR SPACE STATION IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT DAYS
IT IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN DONALD TRUMP HAS PULLED IT OFF AGAIN HE ALWAYS THE BIG WINNER YESTERDAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES SO CALLED SUPER TUESDAY AND IT SEEMS HE WILL WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AS THE RESULTS CAME IN
WE ARE GOING TO BE A MUCH BIGGER PARTY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING WE'RE GOING TO BE A MUCH BIGGER PARTY A PARTY IS EXPANDING AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE PRIMARY STATES WHERE I'VE WON AND JUST LOOK WE'VE GONE FROM X. NUMBER TWO A MUCH LARGER NUMBER
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN MANY MANY DECADES SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE UNIFIED AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE A MUCH BIGGER PARTY AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER
IN OTHER WORDS WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO THE IDEA OF PRESIDENT TRUMP I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PIERS MORGAN HE SPENT SOME YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES PRESENTING A TELEVISION SHOW HE GOT TO KNOW MY PRETTY WELL
I GOT TO KNOW HIM WHEN I TOOK PART IN THE FIRST SERIES OF CELEBRITY APPRENTICE I WAS IN THE SHOW FOR ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AND I SPENT MOST OF THAT TIME WATCHING TRUMP IN HIS NATURAL HABITAT OF HIS BOARDROOM AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM I SAW A PRETTY SMART GUY WHO KNEW HOW TO PLAY THAT BOARDROOM ARE VERY VARIED HUMAN CONTESTANTS LIKE A CONCERT CONDUCTOR I SAW SOMEBODY YOU HAD A WAR
THE GOOD HUMOUR A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE SO WHEN I SEE TRUMP BEING MORE OUTRAGEOUS IN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE'S SAYING AND DOING
I THINK HE'S JUST DOING THAT TO GRAB MEDIA ATTENTION AND I THINK THE REALITY OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY IF IT CAME TO IT WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT MORE MODERATE TRUMP TO ME IS SOMEBODY I'VE KNOWN HIM I CAUSE A DECADE I SPOKEN TO HIM REGULARLY ON THE PHONE YOU RANG ME ABOUT A MONTH AGO WE HAD LONG TED ABOUT THE ELECTION AND IF PEOPLE COULD HEAR HIM WHEN HE HASN'T GOT
THE T.V. CAMERAS IN FRONT OF HIM AND HE WAS JUST ONE ON ONE IS A VERY DIFFERENT BEAST HE'S A LOT CALMER HE'S A LOT MORE RATIONAL THIS IS A GUY REMEMBER HE'S NEVER HAD AN ALCOHOLIC DRINK NEVER HAD A CIGARETTE HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE COFFEE THIS IS A BLOKE COMPLETELY IN CONTROL WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HE'S DOING HE ABLE AT THE OTHER THING ABOUT TRUMP IS THAT HE SAYS OUTRAGEOUS THINGS TIME AFTER TIME AND NOBODY HAS ANY WAY OF JUDGING WHETHER HE MEANS IT OR NOT
I WOULD TREAT ALMOST EVERYTHING HE SAYS IN THIS CAMPAIGN CYCLE WITH A LOT OF SCEPTICISM HE IS LIKE ALL CAMPAIGNERS IN EVERY ELECTION THE SAYING A LOT OF STUFF PURELY DESIGNED TO GET VOTES WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE HIS POLICY WITH MUSLIMS
I DON'T BELIEVE FOR A MOMENT THAT IF TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT HE WOULD TRY AND BAN MUSLIMS FOR ANY SHORT TERM PERIOD FOR MENTIONED THE COUNTRY AND I THINK WE'RE ALREADY SEEING HIM DIALLING BACK ON SOME OF THAT MORE EXTREME RHETORIC BUT OF COURSE
BY SAYING WHAT HE DID HE DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE AND THE MEDIA FOR ANOTHER WEEK BUT HAVEN'T YOU GOT TWO WHETHER YOU KEEP ABUSE ON HIS HEAD OR NOT HAVEN'T YOU GOT TO REGARD SOMEBODY IS VAGUELY RIDICULOUS IF HE TALKS ABOUT BUILDING A GREAT WALL
BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE MEXICANS HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AND WHEN HE ABUSES MEXICANS THE WAY HE DID BRING IT DRUGS CRIME THEY'RE RAPISTS AND SO ON I MEAN IT IS INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE STUFF ISN'T IT IT IS VERY OFFENSIVE IF WE TAKE IT IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA I THINK PROBABLY QUITE DELIBERATELY IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT
WHAT WAS TRUMP ACTUALLY SAYING WHEN HE SAID THAT I'D LISTEN I DON'T AGREE WITH HIS WALL I DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR SHORT TERM BATTLE BOSOMS OF THE COUNTRY I DON'T AGREE WITH HER ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE OR GUNS OR A THINK CHANGE IS A HOAX RIGHT I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ABOUT HALF THESE THINGS AND I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP SO LET ME JUST MAKE THAT CLEAR NOW HOWEVER AS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN THIS ELECTION THE REASON HE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS HE IS VERY VERY
ADROITLY TAPPED IN TO THE POPULAR MOOD ABOUT A NUMBER OF HOT BUTTON ISSUE
AND THE QUESTION OR MEXICO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS POURING OVER THE BORDER FROM MEXICO INTO AMERICA AND A LOT OF AMERICANS I'M TALKING ABOUT
TENS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH IT
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T VOTE FOR HIM IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN WILL YOU BE EVEN KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM EVEN A LITTLE BIT SCARED IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT
WHAT I WOULD LOOK AT A LOT OF TRUMP'S BUSINESSES IN AMERICA NO HE'S A FANTASTICALLY SUCCESSFUL REALITY OR AS THEY CALL IT A PROPERTY TYCOON THERE ARE YOU SUGGESTED HE LIES ABOUT HIS WALTZ ALL THE TIME ON THAT THAT'S THE DISCREPANCY OF HIS WEALTH IS HE WORTH THREE OR FOUR BILLION OR TEN BILLION SO WHAT'S HE GETTING INTO SPLITTING HAIRS ABOUT HOW MANY BILLION SOMEBODY HAS WE CAN PROBABLY RELAX HE'S PRETTY WEALTHY PUT IT THIS WAY HE SEEMS TO BE FUNDING MOST OF HIS CAMPAIGN OR FLYING EVERYWHERE IN A MASSIVE PRIVATE PLANE WHICH
THAT'S EXPENSIVE SO WE'VE GOT TO ASSUME TRUMPS PRETTY WEALTHY AND I THINK FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE HE RUNS PRETTY GOOD BUSINESSES AND HE TENDS TO PUT VERY SMART PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THEM AND HE LIKES HIGH QUALITY NOBODY DISPUTES OR QUALITY OF HIS BUILDINGS OR OF HIS GOLF COURSES OR OF HIS RESORTS
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY DONE AND WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY ACHIEVED YOU CAN PROBABLY SLIGHTLY RELAX A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW OUTRAGEOUS HE WOULD BE I READ TRUMP'S GOING TO BE THE NEW HITLER I FIND THAT AN ABSOLUTELY FACILE WAY OF LOOKING AT A GUY WHO'S BASICALLY A RIGHT WING RICHARD BRANSON
AN AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT NOW REALLY DOES NEED SOMEBODY WHO IS GOOD AT DOING DEALS BARACK OBAMA'S BEEN PARALYSED FROM GUN CONTROL ONWARDS IN THE SENATE IN HIS INABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET ANYTHING DONE
TRUMP WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT DEAL MAKERS IN THE WORLD AND IF HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE VERY LEAST I WOULD PAY GOOD MONEY TO SEE HIM IN A ROOM WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN STRIKING A DEAL
PIERS MORGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER PAST SEVEN ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN WOULD BE WEAKER LESS SAFE AND WORSE OFF OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN A REPORT OUT TODAY THAT LOOKS AT THE ARRANGEMENTS USED BY COUNTRIES LIKE NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND AND CANADA WELL DONE IT IS A JUNIOR MINISTER AT THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE IS ALSO A CAMPAIGNER FOR BRECK SYDNEY'S HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH ME NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU
AND THAT IS THE DIFFICULTY FOR YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU CAN'T SPELL OUT WHAT OUT WOULD LOOK LIKE
THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF OPTIONS SOME THAT HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN CONSIDERED BY THIS REPORT THERE'S THE SWISS OPTION THE NORWEGIAN OPTION THE TURKISH OPTION THE IS THE BRITISH ECONOMY IS BIGGER THAN ALL THOSE COUNTRIES I JUST MENTION COMBINED THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
EUROPEAN FIRMS SELL US FIFTY NINE BILLION POUNDS WORTH MORE OF GOODS AND SERVICES THAN WE SELL THEM SO OF COURSE AS THE PRIME MINISTER THE C.B.I. LORD KERR A FOREMAN BASTARD Y. E.U. HAVE SAID OF COURSE WE HAVE AN AMBITIOUS TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH EVE FROM OUTSIDE
BUT WE WOULD ALSO HAVE GREATER SCOPE TO NEGOTIATE FREE TRADE DEALS FROM LATIN AMERICA TO ASIA AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM MAKING OUR OWN RULES AND LAWS THAT MEANS CHEAPER FOOD PRICES LOWER ENERGY BILLS AND GREATER DEMOCRATIC FREEDOM OVERALL BUT IT
THAT STILL LEAVES THE CASE THAT YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T KNOW AND ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF COURSE WERE PEOPLE GOING IN AND THEY'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN STAYING SOMETHING THAT LARGELY THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND LEAVING IT'S ALMOST VOTE FOR AN ADVENTURE
I THINK THERE'S MORE RISK STAYING IN THE E.U. WHICH IS CRIPPLED BY THE EUROZONE CRISIS FACING ALL THE CHALLENGES ON ITS BORDERS AND VERY WEAK IN FESSING UP TO THE LIKES OF RUSSIA ON ITS BORDERS BUT THE TRUTH IS THE ING CAMPAIGN ARE COMING UP WITH ALL THESE SCAREMONGERING STORIES AND YET WE KNOW GIVEN THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY AND THE WAY IT'S TILTED EUROPEAN FIRMS GERMAN CAR MANUFACTURERS FRENCH FARMERS
PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS SELL US MORE THAN WE SELL THEM THERE'S A MASSIVE STRONG MUTUAL SELF INTEREST THAT WE WILL KEEP A TRADING RELATIONSHIP WHAT ARE WE SAYING THAT HE WAS SO SPITEFUL O.K. BUT IT WAS CUT IT SO KNOWS DESPITE ITS FACE OF WHAT WOULD THAT TRADING RELATIONSHIP LOOK LIKE AND WHAT SEEMS ALMOST INEVITABLE IS THAT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT ALL THOSE ARGUABLY COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THE E.U. THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY SOMETHING AND
IT WOULD MEAN HIGHER TARIFFS THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS PERHAPS CANADA OR NORWAY UP WE'LL ALL OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY BUT IN ORDER YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT TARIFFS IF YOU'RE NOT EXCEPT FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE WELL I'VE SET OUT THE PRINCIPLES OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT UNTIL WE EXIT THE E.U. WE WOULDN'T GET DOWN TURN
THE BRASS TACKS OF THE DETAILS OF THE NIGHT NATURE OUR RELATIONSHIP BUT LET NO ONE BE IN ANY DOUBT WE WOULD HAVE A STRONG TRADING THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. AND THAT SHE WOULD BE BETTER FROM OUTSIDE REMEMBER YOU THERE WILL BUT I WANT TO ASK A DRAG THE AVERAGE DO YOU TELL IF EXTERNALLY IS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT SO LET'S STOP HAVING THESE LUDICROUS STORIES THAT SOMEHOW
WE WILL BE CUT OFF FROM ALL TRADE IS NOT IN OUR INTEREST AND IT'S EVEN MORE CONTRARY TO EUROPEAN INTEREST IT'S JUST NOT IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT GERMAN CAR EXPERT EYES WOULD PUT UP WITH IT
BUT ARE YOU ACCEPTING THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE AND HOW SHE MIGHT LOOK IT'S WORTH IT THEY WERE THE OTHER ADVANTAGES ARE WORTH IT BUT WE WE ACCEPT THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE IN PARIS AND SOME AREAS WOULD BE HARDER HIT THEN I THINK WE WANT TO GO INTO THE NEGOTIATION AND OFFERING A VERY AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE AREAS LIKE AGRICULTURE AND SERVICES WHERE WE MIGHT GET SLIGHTLY HIGHER TARIFFS BUT OF COURSE
THOSE ARE AREAS THAT ARE PROTECTIONIST WITHIN THE SINGLE MARKET IT'S A VERY ODD ARGUMENT PUT HIM BY THE IN CAMPAIGN THAT WE SHOULD STAY IN THE SINGLE MARKET BECAUSE OF THE MOOR PROTECTIONIST AREAS WHICH HIT US MORE OR LESS WHETHER WE'RE IN OR OUT DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT'S DOSSIER THAT THEY PRODUCED TODAY IS A DODGY DOSSIER
I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH SCAREMONGERING IT'S LIKE HALLOWE'EN COME EARLY WE HAD A SCARE STORY EACH WEEK ABOUT THE GHOULISH PROSPECTS OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF THESE GHOULISH STORIES OR OF LIFE OUTSIDE THE E.U. BUT I THINK DODGY IS IT
I'M NOT IAIN DUNCAN SMITH I'LL END UP SHOW THAT I'M AT THE WOODS AND I'LL MY I THINK THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH SCAREMONGERING I THINK THE BRIGHTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRITAIN IN TERMS OF LOWER FOOD BILLS LOWER ENERGY COS FREER TRADE FROM LATIN AMERICA ASIA WHICH OF COURSE ARE THE GROWTH AREAS FOR THE BRITISH ECONOMY AND FOR EXPORT
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ADVANTAGES LIKE SO IT'S A TABLE BEHIND IT'S REALLY STRANGE SITUATION WHERE THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY SAYS A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT HE'S DODGY YOU SAY IT YOU'RE NOT USING THOSE WORDS BUT YOU CLEARLY SAY DISAGREE WITH THAT ENTIRELY
IT SEEMS AN EXTRAORDINARY KRYCEK TUITION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD AND WHAT I'M GOING TO SEE IF WE'RE ALL CLONES AND WHERE WE HAVE REASONABLE AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT AS ON THE YOU YOU FIND THAT ASTONISHING WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT AFTER THE REFERENDUM BECAUSE BLACKROCK THEIR CONSULTANCY GRIPPER SAID THAT DAVID COULD LOSE CONTROL OF HIS PARTY WHATEVER THE RESULT OF IT WELL I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM BUT ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THE FEELING INSIDE THE PARTY REMEMBER PEOPLE TALK TO THE THE THE FACTIONALISM OF THE PAST
ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY A NEW M.P.S TWENTY TEN OR TWENTY FIFTEEN I DON'T GET THE FEELING THAT WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF A OF A BREAKDOWN I THINK THERE'S MORE A BICKERING AND CLAWING EACH OTHER'S EYES OUT IN THE LABOUR PARTY RIGHT NOW FRANKLY BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL HAPPY BADGER WHAT DAVID CAMERON IS HAS HE GIVEN THE BRITISH PEOPLE THE VERDICT ON THIS
THE QUESTION OF OUR TIME AND HE'S GIVEN MINISTERS LICENCE TO EXPRESS THEIR OWN VIEWS AND THE DEAL IS AFTER THAT WE HEAL WE COME BACK AND WE TAKE THE GAME TO THE LABOUR PARTY ON THEY ADMIT MATTERS THAT REALLY COUNT JOBS HOME BUILDING APPRENTICESHIP AND WE MAKE SURE WE'RE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION
DOMINIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES PAST THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CON MEN ALWAYS WILL BE SOME OF THEM NEITHER IN THE SOBER WORLD OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN MIS SELLING THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE IS LESS A BIT NOW THAN THERE WAS IS IT FALLING ITALIA CON MEN AND WOMEN JA INDEED OF WHICH OF COURSE I'M NOT
THE U.K.'S FINANCIAL WATCHDOG THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY CANNOT BE CONFIDENT IT HAS REDUCED MIS SELLING IN THE INDUSTRY THIS ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE NOW THE F.C.A. WILL BE IN FRONT OF M.P.S TODAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMONS PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND SOME OTHER MATTERS THE SCRUTINY COMES AS SOME OF BRITAIN'S BIGGEST BANKS AND SETTING ASIDE AS WE KNOW BILLIONS MORE TO COVER CLAIMS THE MIS SOLD P.P.I. POLICIES
BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY MORE SCANDALS OUT THERE THAN JUST P.P.I. SO WHAT ARE THESE SCANDALS AND DESPITE ALL THE FINES AND CRACKDOWNS ON THE INDUSTRY CAN IT BE TRUE WE CAN SPEAK TO THE AUTHOR AND FORMER BANKER PHILIP AUGER PHILIP BANKS HAVE PUT ASIDE SOME TWENTY TWO BILLION POUNDS IN RESPECT OF THESE SCANS OR P.P.I. IN PARTICULAR SO WHY WOULD THEY MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN
WELL ONE REASON IS BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER TRUST BANKERS THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR BUSINESS MODEL WHICH MAKES IT VERY TEMPTING FOR THEM TO PERMANENTLY CUT CORNERS PUT ARE YOU NOT TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENT BANKERS RATHER THAN RETAIL BANKERS TALKING ABOUT RETAIL BANKERS AS WELL TANYA THERE SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE ABOUT HER BUSINESS WHICH GIVES YOU SO CALLED FREE BANKING OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT BANKING ISN'T FREE IT CAN'T BE FREE BANKING HAS BANKS HAVE TO MAKE THEIR MONEY SOMEHOW
IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT FREE BANKING MODEL THAT THE TEMPTATION EXISTS TO THINK OF NEW WAYS TO GET ROUND THE RULES AND EFFECTIVELY FLEETS THAT CUSTOMERS SO DESPITE THE TWENTY TWO BILLION THE LESSON HAS NOT BEEN LEARNED
I THINK THAT'S PEACE LET'S BE FAIR TO BANKS I THINK THEY HAVE MOVED ON IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO IF YOU WENT INTO A BRAND A BANK BRANCH IT WAS VERY LIKELY THAT THE PERSON SITTING BEHIND THE DESK WOULD BE FINANCIALLY INCENTIVISED TO SELL YOU A PRODUCT WHETHER YOU NEEDED IT OR NOT
WHAT THE BANKS HAVE DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS REMOVED THOSE VERY DIRECT INCENTIVES THEY NOW MEASURE THEIR STAFF IN A MORE IN A MORE BALANCED WAY OTHER CUSTOMERS SATISFIED DO THEY TREAT YOU PROPERLY BUT IS IT NOT THE ROLE OF THE REGULATOR THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY TO MONITOR THIS AND STOP IT
VERY MUCH SO THEY THEY ARE MUCH MORE INTRUSIVE THAN THEY WERE BUT THE REALLY DIFFICULT QUESTION THEY HAVE TO ANSWER IS WHY THEY DROPPED A PLANNED INQUIRY INTO BANKING CULTURE WHICH WAS ON THEIR WORK SCHEDULE FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THAT AND THAT IS THE QUESTION I THINK THAT THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE F.C.A. TRACY MCDERMOTT WILL HAVE TROUBLE ANSWERING TODAY AT THE AT THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTS SAID BRIEFLY AS CONSUMERS SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED VIGILANT RATHER THAN CONCERNED I WOULD SUGGEST
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANKS TURNING TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST SEVEN WILL BE THOSE WHO HEARD THE AIRFIELD GREAT OUT HERE I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU GUYS ARE ALL INVOLVED WITH TEMPERATURES HOVERING AROUND FREEZING I IMAGINE YOU GUYS ARE THANKFUL FOR YOUR JACKET'S BURDENS FOR SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T HAD THE BREEZE ON FEES FOR ALMOST A YEAR I BET IT FEELS PRETTY GREAT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL LANDING BACK ON EARTH FOR A COUPLE OF ASTRONAUT WHO'S SPENT THE LAST YEAR IN SPACE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ONE OF THEM RUSSIAN THE OTHER AN AMERICAN WHO SET A NEW RECORD FOR AN AMERICAN IN SPACE THE POINT OF THEIR MISSION WAS FIND OUT HOW THE HUMAN BODY WOULD COPE WITH BEING WEIGHTLESS FOR SO LONG LIBBY JACKSON IS FROM THE U.K. SPACE AGENCY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WE SORT OF GOT AN IDEA HAVEN'T WE BECAUSE A RUSSIAN WAS UP THERE FOR WHAT WAS IT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MONTHS SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S THE LONGEST TIME AND SPACE WAS ABOUT THAT LENGTH BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A LONG DURATION MISSION OF A YEAR WHILST THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS ABOUT THERE SO IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WITH A SORT OF NEW
MOST RECENT MEDICAL UNDERSTANDING TO GO AND LOOK AT HOW THE HUMAN BODY BEHAVES AND WHETHER ALL THE COUNTER MEASURES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT ASTRONAUTS CAN CAN FUNCTION AFTER A YEAR WORKING AS WELL AS WE THINK THEY WELL SO FAR
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL UNDERGO INTENSIVE TESTING BET BUT SO FAR WHAT'S THE VERDICT
SCOTT LOOK TO A VERY WELL THIS MORNING WHEN THEY LANDED SO THEY'RE HAPPY TO BE HOME IT'S YOU SAY WILL TAKE SOME TIME THIS EXPERIMENT IS REALLY ABOUT THREE YEARS LONG THERE WAS A LOT OF MEDICAL DATA COLLECTED BEFORE THEY LEFT SOME OF THE SAMPLES THAT THEY'VE COLLECTED WHILST IN SPACE
THEY'VE BEEN GUINEA PIGS AND HAD URINE AND SALIVA AND BLOOD AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS COLLECTED THEY'RE STILL UP ON THE SPACE STATION AND WON'T COME HOME FOR A FEW MONTHS SO IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR THE SCIENTISTS TO ANALYSE EVERYTHING AND WE'LL SEE THE RESULTS PUBLISHED IN THE IN THE COMING YEARS THERE MUST BE A BIT SMELLY SHOWER FREE IT IS NOT THE MOST PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT AT ALL TIMES YOU HAVEN'T SMELT FRESH AIR EVERY YEAR YOU HAD VERY LITTLE FRESH FOOD FOR A YEAR AND YES YOU HAVEN'T HAD A SHOWER OR A SET OF REALLY CLEAN CLOTHES FOR
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF YOU SMELL SMELLY TO YOURSELF AS IT WERE I THINK THEY GET USED TO LIVING IT ISN'T IN THE SMELLS UP THERE BUT THERE YESTERDAY HAD TO SMELL FRESH AIR AFTER A YEAR IN ZE INSIDE IS QUITE SOMETHING I THINK IT MUST BE AMAZING NOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS IF WE DO EVER WANT TO GO TO MARS WILL WANT TO GO TO MARS WE EVER MANAGE IT IT THIS'LL TELL US WHETHER IT'S FEASIBLE FROM A HUMAN POINT OF VIEW FROM THEIR BODIES
INDEED IF WE HAD TO GO THERE THERE THERE ROUND TRIP TIME IS LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH WITH PERHAPS A NINE MONTH JOURNEY THERE ARE NINE MONTH JOURNEY BACK RIGHT WHEN YOU GET TOMAS YOU'VE GONE THERE TO DO SCIENCE AND AN EXPLORATION YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND FUNCTION SO SCOTT OR MIKAIL HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THERE HOW THEIR BONES AND THEIR MUSCLES REACT BUT ALSO HOW THEIR FINE MOTOR SKILLS ARE BEHAVING HOW THEIR METABOLISM IS BEHAVING ALL SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT WE CAN SEE
IF THE HUMAN BODY CAN CAN SURVIVE A YEAR FLOATING IN SPACE AND THEN RETURNED TO A GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT AND FUNCTION WELL AND THE HUMAN MIND
INDEED THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW THEY GETTING ON IT'S A LONG TIME TO SPEND IN A SMALL SPACE AT THE SPACE STATION'S SPACIOUS BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT ONLY FIVE PEOPLE THERE SO THEY ARE THEY'RE STUDYING EVERY DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THEMSELVES IT'LL BE FIRST HE WANTED LIBBY JACKSON THANKS VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU

THE GOOD INJURY DATA ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS BUT WE HAVE COMPELLING EVIDENCE COLLECTED OVER TWELVE YEARS BUT FROM STUDIES THAT SHOW THERE'S A TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT RISK OF INJURY FOR A CHILD RUGBY PLAYER OVER SEASON THE FIFTEEN GAMES BONE CHILD YOU MEAN ONE WHAT AGE WE TOURED WELL ABSOLUTELY BUT IT'S ANY CHILD UP TO THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN THOUGH THE RISKS AND RATES OF INJURIES A INCREASE OF COURSE THERE'S CONTACT IS INTRODUCED AND WITH THEIR AGE
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS THE R.A.F. YOU ROLLING OUT RUGBY UNION NOW TO A MILLION CHILDREN IN THE U.K. AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY STATE SCHOOLS AND IF YOU'RE THINKING OF A MILLION CHILDREN PLAYING EVERY YEAR WITH THIS RISK OF INJURY YOUR TALK LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EXTRA INJURIES A YEAR INCLUDING UP TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND WELL EXCEPT THAT THE SMALLEST CHILDREN DON'T TACKLE THEY DON'T GET TO TACKLE IN MOST SCHOOLS ANYWAY AND I THINK THE COLD WILL SAY UNTIL THEY'RE ELEVEN OR TWELVE
JOHN THE CODE MAY SAY THE CHILDREN DON'T TACKLE TILL ELEVEN OR TWELVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING THE TACKLE FROM THE CONTACT ELEMENT OF THE SPORT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING IT FROM SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHERE THE WRISTS AND RATES OF INJURY IN THE CONTACT SPORT ARE VERY VERY HOW DO YOU DO YOU YOU'VE ACKNOWLEDGED
THE DIFFICULTY OF COLLECTING THE DATA BUT UNLESS YOU CAN SAY WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING SERIOUSLY INJURED I MEAN EVERY SPORT YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO IS THAT THAT FOLLOWS YOU FALL OFF YOUR BIKE EVERY SPORT DOES NOT HAVE COLLISION BUILT INTO THE GAME RUGBY IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT BUILDS AND COLLISION AND CONTACT INTO THE GAME SO BICYCLING YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO COLLIDE WITH A DOUBLE DECKER BUS NOR DO YOU CHOOSE TO COLLIDE WITH THE GROUND IF YOU COULD FALL OFF A TREE
YOUR COLLISION IS BUILT INTO THE GAME NINETY PER CENT OF ALL INJURIES OCCUR DURING COLLISION AND DURING THE TACKLE THESE INJURIES CAN BE SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING THEIR FRACTURES CONCUSSION THEY'RE LIGAMENT AS TEARS AND THEY CAN BE ALSO INCLUDE SPINAL INJURIES THEY CAN BE LIFE THREATENING
DEVASTATING IN THEIR CONSEQUENCES ALSO RESULT IN A LOT OF TIME LOST FROM SCHOOL AND SPORT OUT SO YOUR AUNTY PER CENT OF INJURIES CAN RESULT IN MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS LOST FROM ALL RIGHT MATT THAT PERRY AND THAT IS A FACT ISN'T IT THAT IT IS BUILT INTO THE SPORT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO TACKLE THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AT THE CERTAINLY YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT
YES YOU HAVE TO DO MORE IN JOHN YOU HAVE THE RISK HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE BUT WE LIVE IN A WORLD NOW OF DATA KNOWLEDGE WE CAN SIT IN BED IN THE MORNING IN GOOGLE HOW HOW DO I GET OUT OF BED AND KEEP MYSELF SAFE TODAY
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT IN A SENSE AREN'T YOU THAT ISN'T THE POT THIS IS DELIBERATE AND YOU SEEN IT MORE THAN I HAVE BUT I'VE SEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF IT STANDING ON THE TOUCHLINE WATCHING THESE KIDS AND AT ELEVEN OR TWELVE THIRTY BY THE TIME YOU GET TO FIFTEEN OR SIX FOOT TWO WHEN THEY WEIGH THIRTEEN FOURTEEN STONE THERE MEN SMASHING INTO EACH OTHER I THINK THEY MAY HAVE MISSED A TRICK FROM THE LEGACY OF THE WORLD CUP
DUE TO THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU HAVE TO OWN YOUR OWN WAY FORWARD THAT IS FROM PARENTING AT THE AGE EIGHT PARENTS ON THE SIDELINES SHOUTING SMASH AND GET INTO THEM PHYSICALLY IT COMES THE COACHING COACHES WHO HAVE GOOD SAFETY PROTOCOL AND IF THE R.F.U. REALLY TALKED ABOUT LEGACY THEY SHOULD HAVE DEVELOPED COACHES WHO UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY HOW TO LOOK AFTER KIDS YOU AS POTENTIAL CONCUSSION
AND COACH THEM WELL AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT HAS IMPROVED BY OWN OBSERVATION IS THAT THAT HAS IMPROVED YOU SEE A CHILD WHO'S NOT WHO'S A BIT DOPEY FIRM THIRTY SECONDS AND YOU IMMEDIATELY GOING OFF THE PITCH BUT THE FACT IS THEY ARE THEY HAVE UNDER THIS THE WAY RUGBY IS PLAYED THEY HAVE TO TACKLE EACH OTHER THAT IS
PARTLY THE POINT OF THE GAME I PUT SIX BEERS THAT THAT KIDS WANT TO DO THAT THEY GET BUTTON FROM DOING THAT THEY ENJOYED DOING IT BUT THEY CAN GET INJURED IN THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FOR STOPPING IT ISN'T THAT
AT THE SCHOOLS HAVE A DUTY OF CARE TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN MODES OUT SPACEY EASY TAKE THE TACKLE OUR RUGBY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT LEFT WHERE DO YOU STOP YOU'VE GOT TO DO ON A SORT OF GAME THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BECOMES VERY STERILE AND WHAT HAPPENS I THINK THE PROFESSIONAL GAME
AS A RESPONSIBILITY LOOK AT THE TACKLE NOW MAYBE TEN SIXTEEN YEARS AGO CERTAINLY WHEN I STARTED IT WAS A ONE MAN TACKLE WAY YOU KNOW YOU DID THE OLD SCHOOL WE GO BEHIND THE THE BOTTOM AND TRY AND TAKE A PLAYER DOWN NOW ONE LOW ONE HIGH ONE ON THE BALL SO YOU KNOW THE PHYSICALITY OF THE GAME AT PROFESSIONAL LEVEL BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT STOPPING THAT TACKLE
AT SCHOOL LEVEL WHAT HAPPENS WHERE'S THERE A CAT WHAT HAPPENS TO LOCAL RUGBY WHAT HAPPENS TO COMMA ARTERY TEAM SPIRIT DISCIPLINE RUGBY GAVE ME DISCIPLINE IT GAVE ME A SELF AWARENESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO LOOK AFTER MY BODY AND TO RESPECT THE BODY OF OTHERS AND IT COMES DOWN TO GOOD COACHING AND MANAGEMENT PARENTING
AND REGULATION THAT DOESN'T USE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GET RID OF A TACKLE BUT WE JUST HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ON SAFETY PROTOCOL AROUND THE CUMBERSOME COLLAR GOING TO SENTENCE YOU WOULD ACCEPT THAT NO I DON'T UNDER THE U.N. CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD TO MINISTERS HAVE A DUTY OF CARE TO CHILDREN MOST OF THE INJURIES OCCURRING DURING THE TACKLE AND DURING CONTACT AND THAT THESE INJURIES ARE SERIOUS AND LIFE THREATENING THAT IS THE POINT IN THE FINAL VERY QUICK THOUGHT MATT BUT THEY COULD BE OUT THERE
AND INCURRED DURING THE TACKLE THAT IS THE POINT THAT IF WE TAKE A RISK I TOOK THE REST FAR SIDE RUGBY AT SEVEN I'M AFRAID AT SCHOOL LEVEL IS THAT TATTLE IS TAKE HIM OUT YOU KNOW WE'VE LOST ONE OF THE GREAT GOES ONE OF THE GREAT CULTURAL GATES WE TAKE THE RISK WE HAVE TO OWNED HER OWN WAY FORWARD MATT PERRY ALLYSON POLLOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED BEEN ITCHING TO SEE WHAT I THINK ABOUT THAT
IT'S NOW NINETY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEWSPAPERS AND THERE'S DEEP SUSPICION ABOUT THE HOME SECRETARY'S PLANS IN HER STATEMENT TO M.P.S YESTERDAY GETTING POLICE EXTENDED POWERS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET RECORD SMART PHONES AND COMPUTERS HAVE SUSPECTS THE TELEGRAPH ARGUES THAT THE POWERS OF THE POLICE AND OTHER STATE BODIES TO CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES QUITE UNLIKE THE SECURITY SERVICES THE TIME SAYS THERE'S A LONG AND REGRETTABLE HISTORY OF BRITISH POLICE EXPLOITING FOR OTHER PURPOSES
POWERS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO COMBAT SERIOUS CRIME THE GUARDIAN WHAT IS THAT MEASURES INITIALLY ADVANCE TO DEAL WITH SERIOUS CRIMINALS WILL BE TURNED ON MIGRANTS WITH NEW POWERS FOR OFFICIALS PURSUING IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY OFFENCES THE MIRROR WARNS OF THE BREACH OF PEOPLE'S PRIVACY MUST FIT THE CRIME THE SUN EXCEPT THAT POLICE WILL NEED A JUDGE OR SATO BEFORE USING THEIR POWERS BUT THAT CANNOT BE RUBBER STAMPING IT SAYS THOSE JUDGES WILL BE THE GATEKEEPERS OF PEOPLE'S PRIVACY
THE TIMES REPORTS THAT DAVID CAMERON'S TO PER SPIN THE QUEEN'S SPEECH SCHEDULED FROM MAY UNTIL AFTER THE E.U. REFERENDUM ACCORDED THE PAPER DELAYING THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME WILL HELP MY CAMERON TO REBOOT HIS PREMIERSHIP AFTER THE REFERENDUM IT QUITS MINISTERS ARE SAYING THE PRIME MINISTER HOPES TO USE A VICTORY ON EUROPE TO RECAPTURE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY AND DRIVE THROUGH LAWS TO GUARANTEE HIS LEGACY AS A MODERNISER MEANWHILE THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR LORD LAMONT BEX THE CAMPAIGN TAKE BRITAIN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
AND ASK FOR THE TELEGRAPH HE SAYS WARNINGS ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES TO MEMBERSHIP ARE IRRELEVANT THE STATE PENSION AGE IS BEING REVIEWED AGAIN MAKING THE LEAD FOUR THREE PAPERS BUT THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON HOW LONG TODAY'S YOUNGER GENERATION WILL HAVE TO WAIT BEFORE THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR THEIR BED NOW IT'S WORK TO FIFTY FIFTY SEVEN TO SEVENTY FIVE ECLAIRS THE SUN'S HEADLINE WORK TILL YOU'RE EIGHTY ONE THE EXPRESS WARNS THAT IF THE CONSTANT ATTACKS ON PENSIONS CONTINUE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE WILL GET THE CHANCE TO HAVE ANY RETIREMENT AT ALL
BRITISH SCIENTISTS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE GENE THAT GIVES PEOPLE GREY HAIR AND THE TELEGRAPH SAYS THEY'RE CONFIDENT THEY CAN PRODUCE DRUGS OR COSMETICS THAT WOULD SWITCH IT OFF
THE MAIL SAYS A DRUG OR SHAMPOO THAT INTERVENES IN THE PROCESS WOULD REMOVE THE NEED FOR WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE TO MAKE REPEATED TRIPS TO THE HAIR SALON TO HAVE THEIR ROOTS TOUCHED UP AND FINALLY IT SEEMS THAT COUPLES ARE SEEKING OUT EVER MORE LUXURIOUS PRESENTS FOR THEIR WEDDING GIFT LISTS RESEARCHED BY JOHN LEWIS SHOWS THESE DAYS MOST BRIDES AND GROOMS ALREADY OWN THINGS LIKE TOASTERS AND THEY ARE
REQUESTING IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD OR HIGH END ENDED GIFT SUCH AS TELEVISION SOUND SYSTEMS AND HOME GYM EQUIPMENT ACCORDING TO THE MAIL THE STAFF AND THE CUSTOMERS WERE CHOOSING WHAT THEY WANTED RATHER THAN WHAT THEY NEEDED TELEGRAPH REPORTS OF THE TOASTER FOR GENERATIONS THE KITCHEN GADGET OF CHOICE HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE NEW TREE BULLER TO THE TRENDY JUICE MAKER COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED QUID
IT CAN COST A LOT LESS THAN THAT FOR SCRAP THE LOT TWO HUNDRED I THINK IF YOU GET ALL THE EXTRA PART RIGHT TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT SIXTY MINUTES TO EIGHT NO ONE IS REALLY SURE WHAT THEIR DAILY BRUTALITIES THAT SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE CARRIES OUT IN ITSELF DECLARED CAL EFFECT
REPORTING FROM SIRIUS SO DANGEROUS NOW THE VERY FEW CORRESPONDENTS MANY NEWS ORGANISATION GO ANYWHERE NEAR I S. CONTROLLED AREAS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIVIST GROUPS THAT SMUGGLE INFORMATION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT HUGE RISK THEIR OWN LIVES WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ONE ACTIVIST BASED IN RAKKA THE CAPITAL OF ISLAMIC STATE CONTROLLED TERRITORY THIS WEEK WE'RE BROADCASTING DIARIES HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT LIFE THERE WITH CHANGE NAMES AND SOME DETAILS AND HAD HIS WORDS SPOKEN BY AN ACTOR TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY THE DAYS SEEM ALL THE SAME NOW
THE REVOLUTION SPARKED MY HOPES AND DREAMS I DREAMT OF LEAVING MY COUNTRY AND BUILDING A BETTER LIFE ELSEWHERE BUT THAT'S NO LONGER POSSIBLE ANYWAY MY COUNTRY NEEDS ME I HEAR HER CALLING LIKE A MOTHER TO HER SON IT'S EARLY MORNING AND THEN ALWAYS AFORE FOUR HAS WALKING ME I CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS AND MY NEIGHBOUR'S CHILDREN CRYING
IT'S A BITTER REMINDER OF REALITY AND THE NEED TO STOP DREAMING AND FOCUS ON STAYING ALIVE THEY EXPLOSIONS ARE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER MY BROTHER AND I GO OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ONE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS AS RUNNING AROUND HYSTERICALLY HE'S ASKING IF ANYONE HAS SEEN HIS SON HE WENT TO BUY SOME BREAD
THOSE AREN'T HER SAY THE BOMBS HAVE IT DOUBLE MOHAMMED'S HOUSE NEAR THE NETTING ROUND ABOUT WE DON'T DO IT AS FAST AS WE CAN TO FIND SCATTERED BODIES ONE OF THEM BELONGS TO A PREGNANT WOMAN NEIGHBOURS TELL US SHE WAS DUE TO GIVE BIRTH IN JUST A FEW DAYS' TIME THEN THE ALWAYS ARE FOUR PLANES GROWS LOUDER WHAT IS OVERHEAD WE ALL SCATTER IT'S WHITE LIKE THE ONES THAT HIT US A FEW DAYS AGO A RUSSIAN PLANE
AFTER THE PLANES HAD ALL GONE I GOT UP AND WALKED TO THE SHOP BUY WORKIN MY BOSS WHO WAS QUIETLY SIPPING TEA GIVE ME A WEARY SMILE
I NOTICED HE WASN'T SMOKING THAT WAS VERY UNUSUAL HE USUALLY HAD A CIGARETTE WITH HIS TEA BUT THAT WHICH HAS BANNED SMOKING NOW AFTER SMELLING HIS CIGARETTE THEY HAD HUMILIATED HIM IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
THEN THEY BEAT HIM UP AS IF HE WAS A CRIMINAL WHILE WE WERE TALKING TO MEN CARRYING SOME PAPERS WENT INTO THE SHOP NEXT DOOR SECONDS LATER THEY WALKED INTO OURS
THEY HANDED US BOTH PIECES OF PAPER BEFORE LEAVING WITHOUT A WORD THESE WHERE AN ORDER FROM DASH BANNING ALL TELEVISIONS AND SHOPS WE HAD A WEEK TO REMOVE OURS IT SEEMS IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO STOP US TALKING TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD NOW WE CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT EITHER
IF IT'S A LATER A FRIEND CAME IN THE SHOP WE HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE HE WAS ARRESTED BY THAT AGE FOR THE FOURTH TIME ABOUT A MONTH AGO
YOU WERE ALIVE I SHOUTED WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD HE LAUGHED WITH A WEE SMILE ON HIS FACE
HE TELLS ME THAT THE LAST TIME HE WAS ARRESTED IT WAS BECAUSE HIS TROUSERS WERE TOO LONG DASH INSISTS THAT THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE UP OF ANKLE LENGTH ANYONE PHONE BREAKING THE SCHOOL HAS TO UNDERGO A WEEK LONG SHERRY A CHORUS
THEN MY MOBILE RANK IT WAS MY MOTHER SHE ASKED ME TO BUY SOME GROCERIES FOR THE FAMILY BUT I CAN'T AFFORD MUCH THESE DAYS TOMATOES NOW COURSE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS AND RICE IS ON FIVE HUNDRED IT'S TERRIBLE
ON THE WAY BACK I THOUGHT UP LOTS OF EXCUSES TO EXPLAIN WHY I RETURNED WITH SO LITTLE FOOD BUT I DIDN'T NEED TO LIKE MOST PARENTS HERE MY MOTHER WAS JUST DELIGHTED THAT I HADN'T BEEN ARRESTED OR KILLED AND WAS SAFELY HOME AGAIN
WELL WE'RE HERE ANOTHER OF THOSE DIARIES TOMORROW YOU CAN SEE AN ANIMATED VERSION OF TODAY'S ENTRY PRODUCED BY THE ARTIST ANIMATOR SCOTT QUAIL ON OUR WEBSITE AS USUAL B. B. C. DOT CO DOT U.K. FORWARD SLASH TODAY HERE IT IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US THIS MORNING IS FRANCE'S CAMEL VICE CHANCELLOR OF SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY AND LEARN THE GOODBODY PRICES GOOD MORNING JOHN GOOD MORNING SARAH
FOLLOWING THE COUNTERTERRORISM AND SECURITY ACT BRITISH UNIVERSITIES AND I'D HAVE A STATUTORY DUTY TO HAVE DUE REGARD TO PREVENT PEOPLE BEING DRAWN TO TERRORISM SCHOOLS HAVE SIMILAR GUIDELINES
A YOUNG TEACHER IN EAST LONDON RECENTLY ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT'S COUNTER TERRORISM STRATEGY COULD BE AN OBSTACLE TO ALMOST DISCUSSION BETWEEN PUPILS AND TEACHERS ABOUT RELIGION
THE QUESTION GOES TO THE HEART OF A PROBLEM FACED BY OUR SOCIETY
EDUCATORS AND GOVERNMENT WANT TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WILL BE EQUIPPED TO BECOME GOOD CITIZENS WITH THE SKILLS AND VALUES TO ENGAGE PARTICIPATE AND CONTRIBUTE CONSTRUCTIVELY
OUR SOCIETY DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ITS YOUTH RADICALISED BUT HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT HAPPENING FOR SOME THE BEST RESPONSE IS A SECURITY ONE RELYING ON STATE POWERS AND THE POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
AND AND SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT CASES THAT MIGHT BE PROPORTIONATE BUT FOR OTHERS ESPECIALLY EDUCATORS THE RESPONSE GOES TO THE VERY HEART OF THE PURPOSE OF AN EDUCATION
TO EXPAND THEIR MIND TO PREPARE THE STUDENT TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE THE WORLD CRITICALLY AND TO DISCERN THEIR PATH IN LIFE BY TESTING THEIR VIEWS AND BELIEFS
THAT IS THE CORE MISSION OF A UNIVERSITY AS DESCRIBED BY BLESSED JOHN HENRY CARDINAL NEWMAN IN HIS UNRIVALLED NINETEENTH CENTURY TEXT ON THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY
HE WROTE IT IS THE PLACE WHERE A THOUSAND SCHOOLS MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS IN WHICH THE INTELLECT MIS SAFELY RE ENGINED SPECULATE SURE TO FIND IT'S EQUAL IN SOME ANTAGONISTIC ACTIVITY AND IT'S JUDGE IN THE TRIBUNAL OF TRUTH
SO THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO FIND A PROPORTIONATE MEANS TO ADHERE TO THE LAW AND PROTECT SOCIETY BUT AT THE SAME TIME REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE PURPOSE OF A HOLISTIC EDUCATION
I COME BACK TO THE YOUNG TEACHERS QUESTION AND MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE TEACHERS WHO UPHELD SOCIETY'S VALUES AMIDST THE TURMOIL OF THE TROUBLES
MANY BEYOND NORTHERN IRELAND MIGHT STILL ASSOCIATE THE SCHOOLS WITH BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM
BUT FOR THOSE OF US IN THE SCHOOLS AT THAT TIME THEY WERE AN OPENING TO A WORLD BEYOND
AND TEACHERS THROUGH RATIONAL ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGE AND PERSONAL EXAMPLE REMINDED US ALL OFF THE SACREDNESS OF HUMAN LIFE REGARDLESS OF HOW DIFFICULT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT ENGAGEMENT OPENED CLOSED MINDS INCLUDING MINE
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AN EDUCATION
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH FRANCIS CAMPBELL THE TIME IS NINE MINUTES TO EIGHT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUBLISHED ITS SECOND PAPER THIS WEEK ON WHY BRITAIN SHOULD VOTE TO STAY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IT ARGUES THAT THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD MAKE US WEAKER LESS SAFE AND WORSE OFF
THE WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH HE WANTS US TO LEAVE THE COURT HAS CALLED IT A DODGY DOSSIER THAT WON'T FOOL ANYONE WELL THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND JOINS US FROM WESTMINSTER NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW CAN YOU KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE WEAKER LESS SAFE AND WELL
THE DOCUMENT WE'VE PUBLISHED TODAY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN MANDATED BY PARLIAMENT TO PUBLISH AT SETTING OUT ALTERNATIVES TO MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS WITH OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE UNION AND LOOKING AT HOW THOSE MODELS WORK AND CONSIDERING WHETHER THEY WOULD WORK FOR THE U.K. BUT THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN
HE'S TELLING US THAT BRITAIN WOULD BE BETTER OFF OUT OF EUROPE AND IT'S FOR THEM TO SPELL OUT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY BELIEVE WE COULD AGREE WITH THE EUROPEAN CREDIT EUROPEAN UNION A CREDIBLE PICTURE OF HOW BRITAIN COULD WORK OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS COMPLETELY MISSING THEY'VE OFFERED US NOTHING NO PROPOSALS NO DETAIL AT ALL AND WHAT WE ARE SEEKING TO DO HERE IS TO ANALYSE THE EVIDENCE
OF THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES OPERATE WITH NON MEMBER COUNTRIES TO LOOK AT WHETHER THEY WOULD WORK FOR BRITAIN AND OUR CONCLUSION IS THEY WOULDN'T OH KAY LORD THE MODE AS WRITTEN IN THE TELEGRAPH TODAY AND HE'S SIDING WITH THOSE HE HE RECKONS WE SHOULD LEAVE THE E.U. AND HE MAKES THE POINT OF THAT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE E.U. COUNTRIES LIKE SWITZERLAND OR THE UNITED STATES WHO OUT'S TAKE SWITZERLAND IT EXPORTS MORE PER CAPITA TO TO THE INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION THAN WE DO SO ALL THIS TALK ABOUT YOU LEAVE YOU WON'T HAVE ACCESS COMPANIES WILL BE AFFECTED HE SAYS THIS IS IRRELEVANT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE
WELL IT DOESN'T LOOK THE POINT IS THIS THE THE CAMPAIGN HAS TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT CHOICES YES WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THE THE EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE SET OUT IN THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THAT IS POSSIBLE BUT THAT AGREEMENT WOULD COME WITH A PRICE TAG
AND THE PRICE THAT COUNTRIES LIKE NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND PAY FOR THEIR ACCESS NOT TOTAL ACCESS BUT THEY'RE PARTIAL ACCESS TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET IS THAT THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF EUROPEAN MIGRANTS AND IN BOTH CASES SWITZERLAND NORWAY HAVE A FAR HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR POPULATION EUROPEAN MIGRANTS THAN WE DO HERE IN THE U.K. IN BOTH CASES THEY HAVE TO MAKE
HER CONTRIBUTION TO THE E.U. BUDGET EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CASES IN BOTH CASES THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT EUROPEAN REGULATIONS ALL THE RULES THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED US TO VOTE OUT RAIL AGAIN SO HARSHLY ALL OF THOSE RED CASES AND IN BOTH CASES THERE IS NO
ARGUMENT FOR JOINING THE E.U. THEY ARE BOTH A VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR LOT ON THE CONTRARY SWITZERLAND AND THE Y. YOU ARE AT LOGGERHEADS OVER THEIR ARRANGEMENTS AND THE E.
THE JOHN CLAUDIE ONGKA HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT THE SWISS Y. AGREEMENT IS COMING TO THE END OF ITS TEN ABILITY IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE CHANGED IT'S NOT PRO E.U. CAMPAIGN HAS ADMITTED DEFEAT AND CLOSE DOWN THAT THERE IS NO BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH IN BOTH THESE COUNTRIES ARE PORTRAYED AS LOOK AT THIS AWFUL DEAL THEY'VE GOT THEIR THERE DO NOT WANT TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN UNION IF THEIR DEAL HE'S SO BAD WHY DO THEY NOT WANT TO REJOIN YOUR OPINION
THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES TO THEIR ECONOMIES THE THE REALITY ABOUT BRITAIN IS THAT OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS OUR ECONOMY HAS SHAPED ITSELF AROUND OUR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OUR EXPORTERS HAVE SHAPED THEIR BUSINESS AROUND THE ACCESS THE TARIFF FREE ACCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET AND IF WE WERE TO LEAVE IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
IT WOULD WE WOULD REVERT TO A WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION MODEL WHERE WE FACED TARIFFS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST OUR GOODS AND GOODS BEING IMPORTED INTO THE U.K. FROM EUROPE WOULD ALSO
THEN FACE THOSE TARIFFS AND WHAT THE WHAT THE OUT CAMPAIGNERS HAVE TO TELL US IF THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT AND PROMOTE ONE OF THE EXISTING MODELS LIKE THE NORWEGIAN MODEL OF THE SWISS MODEL IF THEY SAY WE WOULD NEGOTIATE FROM SCRATCH THEY'VE GOT TO TELL US HOW LONG THAT WOULD TAKE BECAUSE TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY TAKE MANY MANY YEARS TO NEGOTIATE IF THIS IS THE CASE THAT
BY LEAVING WE WOULD HAVE SOME TERRIBLE SITUATION HAPPEN WHY IS IT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER IN NOVEMBER WAS SAYING
I'M NOT SAYING FOR ONE MOMENT THAT BRITAIN COULDN'T SURVIVE OUTSIDE OF COURSE WE COULD WE'RE A GREAT COUNTRY THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY BIGGING IT UP AND MAKING THE POINT THAT
HE WASN'T RULING ANYTHING OUT SUDDENLY A FEW MONTHS LATER IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE BEING IF THE SITUATION THE SCENARIO OF LIVING IS BEING PORTRAYED AS DESPERATE
NO ONE IS SAYING WE WOULD BE IN SOME TERRIBLE SITUATION WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THE LEAVES CAMPAIGN HAS TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY WOULD DEAL WITH THESE TRADE OFFS IT IS NOT CREDIBLE TO SUGGEST
THAT YOU COULD HAVE CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF LABOUR WITHOUT HAVING TO ACCEPT E.U. REGULATIONS AND WITHOUT HAVING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE E.U. BUDGET NOW MAYBE THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN WANTS TO SAY THAT THEY'RE PREPARED TO ACCEPT ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THOSE THINGS SURELY WE ARE BETTER OFF INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION
WITH OUR SEAT AT THE TABLE HELPING TO SHAPE THAT'S WHEN I SPEND AS WELL AS BEING BOUND BY THEM AND WHEN I SPOKE TO DOMINIC ROB WHO'S IN FAVOUR OF LEAVING EARLIER HE SAID THERE'S A GREATER RISK FROM STAYING JUST LOOK AT THE CRISIS WITH MIGRATION ON EUROPE'S SOUTHERN BORDERS
AND THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTING US BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PART OF THE SHOWING AN AREA WE'RE NOT PART OF THE EURO AREA WE'VE GOT AN OPT OUT FROM THE JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS PAST SHOULDN'T WE BE HELPING WE ARE HELPING BUT WE ARE HELPING ON THE BASIS OF A VOLUNTARY DECISION BY THE U.K. TO HELP THE GREEKS AND TO HELP THE TURKS TO MANAGE THE SITUATION IN THE EDGY AND WE ARE NOT BOUND TO DO SO
WE DO NOT WE'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE BORDER FREE TRAVEL UNION OF SHINGLE AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF WHAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS NEGOTIATED FOR US WE ARE ABLE TO BE IN THOSE PARTS OF THE E.U. THAT WORK FOR BRITAIN AND OUTSIDE THOSE PARTS THAT DON'T IT'S LITERALLY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
PHILIP HAMMOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE WEATHER JOHN HUBBARD THAT'S VERY MUCH WELL IT'S PRETTY WINTRY OUT THERE WE'VE HAD SOME SNOWFALL THIS MORNING ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHERN IRELAND PARTS OF NORTHERN ENGLAND SCOTLAND AS WELL AND SOME VERY HEAVY WINTERY SHOWERS HAVE BEEN PUSHING DOWN THROUGH WALES AND ARE NOW AFFECTING PARTS OF THE WEST COUNTRY THERE'S A LINE OF VERY HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS RUNNING UP THE M. FOUR AT THE MOMENT AN EASTERLY DIRECTION
SO YOU GET THE GIST IT'S A WINTRY PICTURE BUT SOME SUNSHINE OUT THERE TOO IT'S A VERY SUNNY START ACROSS SOUTH EASTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND RIGHT NOW BUT NOBODY IMMUNE FOR SOME HEAVY AND POTENTIALLY WINTRY SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHERN COUNTIES SOME SNOW UP OVER HIGH GROUND BRIEF ACCUMULATIONS PERHAPS BUT FOR MANY
IT SHOULDN'T CAUSE TOO MANY PROBLEMS HOWEVER SOME VERY STRONG WINDS A LITTLE BIT OF A SIDE SWIPE FROM STORM JPR AFFECTING JUST THE FAR SOUTH WEST OF ENGLAND AND WALES BUT HERE WE COULD SEE GUSTS OF SIXTY POSSIBLY SEVENTY MILES AN HOUR RUSHING DOWN TOWARDS THE CHANNEL ISLANDS LATER ON THIS MORNING AS WELL
NOW THE WINDS WILL EASE LATER ON EFFECTS A BIT OF A RESPITE FAMILIAR SOME DRIER BRIGHTER WEATHER THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE MORE WINTRY SHOWERS PILING IN TO THE WEST OF SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE MORE NORTHWESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES LATER ON IT'S AFTERNOON SIX OR SEVEN WILL BE TYPICAL HIGH OVERNIGHT TONIGHT FURTHER HEAVY WINTERY SHOWERS AND WATCH OUT FOR ICE AS THE SKIES CLEAR FROM THE NORTH LATER ON TONIGHT THANKS JOHN LATER THIS WEEK RADIO FOUR EXPLORES THE FUN OF NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON WEDNESDAY THE SECOND OF MARCH THE HEADLINES DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE IN A STRONG POSITION TO WIN THEIR PARTIES NOMINATIONS FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL RACE AFTER DOMINATING THE SUPER TUESDAY POLES THE GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A REPORT WHICH IT SAYS SHOWS THAT ALL ALTERNATIVES TO E.U. MEMBERSHIP WOULD LEAVE BRITAIN WORSE OFF
EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS TO ANNOUNCE PLANS TO FREE UP HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS TO HELP GREASE DEAL WITH THE INFLUX OF REFUGEES
AND DOCTORS ARE URGING SCHOOLS IN BRITAIN AND IRELAND TO BAN TACKLING IN RUGBY MATCHES THE B. B. C. NEWS IS READ BY CAROLINE NICHOLLS THE TWO FRONT RUNNERS IN THE RACE TO BECOME U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAVE CEMENTED THEIR POSITIONS WITH A SERIES OF VICTORIES IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS AND CAUCUSES ELEVEN STATES VOTED ON WHAT IS KNOWN AS SUPER TUESDAY WITH A LEADING DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON AND THE REPUBLICAN BUSINESSMAN DONALD TRUMP EACH CLAIMING SEVEN VICTORIES
BUT THEY WERE ALSO IMPORTANT WINS FOR THEIR MAIN RIVALS WHO SAID THEY WOULD FIGHT ON THE DEMOCRAT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS WON THREE CONTESTS WELL FOR THE REPUBLICANS TED CRUISE ONE TWO STATES AND MARCO RUBIO CLAIMED HIS FIRST VICTORY OF THE PRIMARY SEASON FROM A TRUMP RALLY IN FLORIDA HE'S OUR NORTH AMERICA EDITOR JOHN SOPER
THIS WAS A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT DONALD TRUMP WHO MET REPORTERS LAST NIGHT HIS TONE WAS CONCILIATORY HE WAS QUIETLY SPOKEN HE DIDN'T CROW AND HE DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE THE NOMINEE BUT HE CLEARLY THINKS THE PRIMARY RACE IS EFFECTIVELY OVER AND TRY TO PRESENT HIMSELF AS A FORCE FOR UNITY WE'VE DONE SOMETHING THAT ALMOST NOBODY THOUGHT COULD BE DONE
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF IT AND I JUST WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS I AM A UNIFIER I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND EVERYBODY GET TOGETHER AND UNIFY AND WHEN WE UNIFY THERE'S NOBODY NOBODY THAT'S GOING TO BEAT US THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE
WITH HIS RIVAL SENATOR TED CRUISE DOESN'T SEE IT LIKE THAT LAUNCHING A CORUSCATING ATTACK ON THE PROPERTY MOGUL AS WELL AS WINNING HIS HOME STATE OF TEXAS THE UNCOMPROMISING RIGHT WING SENATOR ONE IN OKLAHOMA TO AND CALLED ON THE OTHER CANDIDATES TO GET OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT IT BECOMES A STRAIGHT FIGHT BETWEEN HERE
FOR THE DEMOCRATS HILLARY CLINTON WON IMPRESSIVELY ACROSS THE SOUTH AND SHE TOO SEEM TO BE LOOKING TO THE END OF HER PRIMARY BATTLE IN THIS CASE WITH SEDATIVE BERNIE SANDERS AND NOVEMBER'S FIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENCY
SHE ALSO HAD MISTER TRUMP IN HER
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO
NOT TO ME
AMERICAN RAID AGAIN AMERICA NEVER STOPPED BEING GREY
NOTHING IS SETTLED BUT TRUMP VERSUS CLINTON SEEMS THE LIKELIEST MATCH UP
THE GOVERNMENT HAS WARNED THAT FOOD PRICES COULD GO UP IF BRITAIN VOTES TO LEAVE THE E.U. BECAUSE TARIFFS WOULD BE IMPOSED AS PART OF A NEW TRADE DEAL IT'S ISSUED A REPORT GIVING A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES TO E.U. MEMBERSHIP AND HAS CONCLUDED THEY WOULD ALL BE DAMAGING THE CONSERVATIVE CABINET MINISTER IAIN DUNCAN SMITH WHO BACKS THE VOTE LEAVE CAMPAIGN HAS DISMISSED IT AS A DODGY DOSSIER HERE'S OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR NORMAN SMITH
IT REMAINS ONE OF THE KEY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF THIS CAMPAIGN WHAT WOULD OUT LOOK LIKE TODAY DOWNING STREET SEEKS TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER AND CONCLUDES NONE OF THE OPTIONS ARE PREFERABLE TO REMAINING IN THE E.U. IT WARNS OF BRITAIN WERE TO REACH A DEAL THROUGH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION THE U.K. COULD FACE TERRACE OF UP TO FIFTY PER CENT ON SOME FOOD STARTS COSTS WHICH IT SAYS WOULD BE PASSED ON TO BRITISH SHOPPERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER FOOD BILLS IF
HOWEVER WE OPTED FOR AN ARRANGEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT OF NORWAY OR SWITZERLAND WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO ALLOW OPEN ACCESS TO THE U.K. FOR E.U. MIGRANTS AND SPEAKING ON THIS PROGRAMME THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND SAID THE ALTERNATIVES WOULD ALL LEAVE BRITAIN WORSE OFF WHAT WE ARE SEEKING TO DO HERE IS TO ANALYSE THE EVIDENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES OPERATE WITH NON MEMBER COUNTRIES TO LOOK AT WHETHER THEY WOULD WORK FOR BRITAIN AND OUR CONCLUSION IS THEY WOULDN'T
LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS WHO TODAY SECURED THE BACKING OF THE FORMER CONSERVATIVE CHANCELLOR NORMAN LAMONT INSISTED BRITAIN WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE ITS OWN UNIQUE TRADING ARRANGEMENT AND WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY IAIN DUNCAN SMITH DISMISSED THE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT AS A DODGY DOSSIER AND THIS WAS THE VIEW OF ANOTHER LEAVE CAMPAIGN OF THE JUSTICE MINISTER DOMINIK RAB THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH SCAREMONGERING IT'S LIKE HALLOWE'EN COME EARLY WE HAD A SCARE STORY
WEAK ABOUT THE GHOULISH PROSPECTS OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF THESE GHOULISH STORIES OR OF LIFE OUTSIDE THE E.U. NUMBER TEN HOPE BY GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE OVER WHAT BRECHT'S IT MIGHT MEAN TO FORCE THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TO SPELL OUT WHAT LEAVING THE E.U. WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THEY ACCEPT THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IN MORE DETAIL AS A CAMPAIGN DEVELOPS
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PREPARING TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF EUROS ON HUMANITARIAN AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO HELP GRACE COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS UNDER PLANS TO BE PUT FORWARD BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TODAY E. UISGE HUMANITARIAN FUNDS WILL BE DEPLOYED WITHIN EUROPE IN THE SAME WAY THEY'RE USED TO ALLEVIATE CRISES IN CONFLICT ZONES AROUND THE WORLD FROM ATHENS A EUROPE CORRESPONDENT CHRIS MORRIS REPORTS
GREECE WANTS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION EUROS FROM THE E.U. TO HELP IT COPE WITH WHAT THE UN HE'S CALLING A LOOMING HUMANITARIAN DISASTER BORDER RESTRICTIONS FURTHER NORTH HAVE CREATED A BACKLOG OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS ASSUMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN ATHENS WILL SOON NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME
SOME OF THE MONEY GREECE NEEDS CAN BE FOUND FROM EXISTING FUNDS BUT THE COMMISSION IS NOW PROPOSING THAT NEW HUMANITARIAN FUNDING SHOULD BE DEPLOYED IN THE SAME WAY THAT E.U. MONEY IS SPENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND IN CONFLICT ZONES THAT MEANS FOR THE FIRST TIME WORKING DIRECTLY WITH U.N. AGENCIES AND N.G.O.S INSIDE EUROPE RATHER THAN SIMPLY GIVING MONEY TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES LIKE GREECE
EVEN IF SUCH FUNDING CAN BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY THOUGH THE E.U. ALSO NEEDS TO STEM THE FLOW OF NEW ARRIVALS AND THAT MEANS BETTER CO OPERATION WITH TURKEY REMAINS ESSENTIAL
LINE PILOTS ARE CALLING FOR TESTS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A DRONE WERE TO HIT A PLANE AFTER A SERIES OF NEAR COLLISIONS THE BRITISH AIRLINE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION OR BALPA ONCE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SAFETY REGULATOR TO HELP FUND RESEARCH STILL HANDLES IS A FORMER PILOT HE'S A FLIGHT SAFETY SPECIALIST AT BALPA HE TOLD US A COLLISION WITH A DRONE WOULD BE WORSE THAN A BIRD STRIKE BECAUSE THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT CARRY POWERFUL LITHIUM BATTERIES
IF THAT GETS INTO THE CORE OF THE ENGINE WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY LOTS OF HEIDI'S HIGH SPEED POT SPINNING AROUND AND IT'S VERY HOT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN NOW THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THAT WILL CAUSE SOMETHING CALLED CONTAINED ENGINE FAILURE WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY AN EXPLOSION AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES US BECAUSE IN THAT IN THAT SCENARIO YOU END UP WITH BITS OF METAL FLYING AROUND A VERY HIGH SPEED AND THEY COULD PENETRATE FUEL TANKS HYDRAULIC LINES MAY ENTER THE CABIN AS ANY OF THOSE OR A SERIOUS EMERGENCY
HEAD OF THE F.B.I. HAS ACCEPTED THAT FORCING APPLE TO UNLOCK AND I PHONE LINK TO A TERROR ATTACK COULD SET A LEGAL PRECEDENT JAMES CO ME TOLD CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE THAT APPLES I PHONE ENCRYPTION WAS LIKE A VICIOUS GUARD DOG THAT STOPPED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM GATHERING EVIDENCE LAWYERS FOR APPLES SAY THE COMPANY'S BEING ASKED TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT COULD BE USED TO HACK INTO DEVICES
MORE THAN SEVENTY DOCTORS ACADEMICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. AND IRELAND TO BAN TACKLING IN RUGBY GAMES IN SCHOOLS THEY'VE WARNED THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SERIOUS INJURIES WITH TACKLES CAUSING TWO THIRDS OF INJURIES AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONCUSSIONS ALLYSON POLLOK AT QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON HE'S BEHIND THE LETTER TOLD US THE EVIDENCE WAS COMPELLING
RUGBY IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT BUILDS AND COLLISION AND CONTACT INTO THE GAME SO BICYCLING YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO COLLIDE WITH A DOUBLE DECKER BUS NOR DO YOU CHOOSE TO COLLIDE WITH THE GROUND IF YOU COULD FALL OFF A TREE YOU'RE COLLISION IS BUILT INTO THE GAME NINETY PER CENT OF ALL INJURIES OCCUR DURING COLLISION AND DURING THE TACKLE MATT PERRY THE ENGLAND INTERNATIONAL AND FORMER RUGBY UNION FULL BACK FOR BATH TOLD US THAT YOUTH RUGBY WITHOUT THE TACKLE WOULD TAKE THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME
IF YOU TAKE THE TACKLE OUR RUGBY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT LEFT WHERE DO YOU STOP THIS YOU'RE LOOKING AT STOPPING THAT TACKLE AT SCHOOL LEVEL WHAT HAPPENS WHERE'S THERE A CAT WHAT HAPPENS TO LOCAL RUGBY WHAT HAPPENS TO COME COMMA ARTERY TEAM SPIRIT DISCIPLINE RUGBY GAVE ME DISCIPLINE IT GAVE ME A SELF AWARENESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO LOOK AFTER MY BODY AND TO RESPECT THE BODY OF OTHERS
THE U.S. ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY HAS RETURNED TO EARTH FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION HAVING SET A RECORD FOR THE LONGEST TIME IN SPACE BY AN AMERICAN HE SPENT THREE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS ON THE STATION BEN BLAND REPORTS
SCOTT KELLY AND THE RUSSIAN COSMONAUT ME HI ACCORDION COKE TOUCHDOWN ON EARTH AFTER ALMOST A YEAR IN SPACE THE SOYUZ CAPSULE THAT BROUGHT THEM BACK LANDED IN KAZAKHSTAN IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THIS MORNING THEY'D SPENT THREE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS ON BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ABOUT TWICE THE LENGTH OF MOST MISSIONS
THE RECORD FOR THE LONGEST SPACE FLIGHT ARE STILL HELD BY VALERI POLYAKOV A RUSSIAN COSMONAUT WHO SPENT NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT DAYS AWAY FROM EARTH BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
KELLY AND CALLING AND COAT WILL BOTH UNDERGO MEDICAL TESTS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF EXTENDED SPACE FLIGHT ON THE HUMAN BODY THE FINDINGS COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR HUMANS TO TRAVEL EVEN FURTHER IN SPACE PERHAPS ONE DAY AS FAR AS MARS THE CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY MOODY'S HAS CUT ITS OUTLOOK FOR CHINA FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE MODI SAID IT HAD TAKEN THE DECISION BECAUSE OF CHINA'S INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION OF MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC REFORMS
IT IS NOW TEN PAST EIGHT JOINING A MATTER OF MONTHS AGO THAT IF YOU'D PUT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DONALD TRUMP IN THE SAME SENTENCE YOU HAVE BEEN LAUGHTER BY THOSE WHO MAKE A STUDY OF AMERICAN POLITICS AS WELL AS THE OLD JOKE GOES THEY'RE NOT LAUGHING NOW MISTER TRUMP AS CONFOUNDED THE SCEPTICS TIME AND AGAIN AND HIS PERFORMANCE AT THE PRIMARIES YESTERDAY SO CALLED SUPER TUESDAY
MAY WELL HAVE SEALED IT DONALD TRUMP IT'S AGREED EFFECTIVELY TIED UP THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND WILL PROBABLY FIGHT HILLARY CLINTON FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN NOVEMBER WHEN A MAN IS THERE JIM IS THERE JIM A FEW CAVEATS IN THAT INTRODUCTION
JUST A FEW JOHN BUT THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG GOOD MORNING FROM WASHINGTON AND IT IS AS YOU INDICATE A VERY HAPPY ONE FOR DONALD TRUMP AMPHORA HILLARY CLINTON EACH NOW BELIEVING THAT'S THE PARTY NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT WILL BE SITTING IN THEIR GRASP BEFORE THIS MONTH IS SEVEN STATES FOR TRUMP
SEVEN FOR CLINTON IN PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES FROM COAST TO COAST HIS INSURGENCY POWERING ON HER FIGHT AGAINST THE INSURGENT BERNIE SANDERS
NOT OVER YET BUT OVERWHELMINGLY LIKELY TO SUCCEED AND RUNNING THROUGH IT ALL THE SHEER DRAMA OF THE TRUMP PHENOMENON WHICH IS TURNING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY INSIDE OUT AND RECASTING THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN A RATHER BEWILDERING WAY THAT WORRIES DEMOCRATS RATHER MORE THAN SOME OF THEM
TO ADMIT SO THE FOCUS WAS ON HIM OVERNIGHT AND THE GREAT NEGOTIATOR WAS IN HIS ELEMENT
THE CANDIDATE WHO DESPISES WASHINGTON DEAL MAKING BUT SAYS THAT THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM IN AMERICA BUT HE CAN'T FIX
I AM A UNIFIER AND WHEN WE UNIFY THERE'S NOBODY NOBODY THAT'S GOING TO BEAT US THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE
DONALD TRUMP CHOSE A DELIBERATELY CONVERSATIONAL TONE FOR HIS VICTORY SPEECH APART FROM WOUNDING WORKS FOR MARKLE RUBIO THE FLORIDA SENATOR WHO HAD A MISERABLE NIGHT APART FROM A SLENDER LIFELINE FROM THE MINNESOTA CAUCUSES HE WAS A LITTLE MAN SAID THE DONALD CONTEMPTUOUSLY
IT WAS ALL ABOUT HIS OWN ABILITY TO GET THINGS DONE AND HIS EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT IF I'M GOING TO WIN ALL OF THESE STAGE WITH TREMENDOUS NUMBERS AND IF I'M GOING TO COME IN THE WORST IS SECOND IN THE TORAH THREE THAT I MIGHT NOT WIN
I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE A DEMOCRACY I THINK IT'S AWFULLY HARD TO SAY THAT'S NOT THE PERSON WE WANT TO LEAVE THE PARTY YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD SO THE OUTSIDER THE INTERLOPER DISLIKED BY NEARLY ALL THE ELDERS OF HIS PARTY IS NOW ESTABLISHED WITHOUT QUESTION AS FAVOURITE TO BECOME THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE SUMMER
BUT THE BITTERNESS IN PARTY RANKS SPEWED OUT A FEW MINUTES LATER WHEN SENATOR TED CREWS WHO WON TWO STATE SAID TRUMP WOULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY I WOULD BE PRESIDENT WHOSE LANGUAGE CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO HEAR
WE CAN NOMINATE A WASHINGTON DEAL MAKER PROFANE AND VULGAR
WHO HAS A LIFE LONG LOVE USING GOVERNMENT POWER FOR PERSONAL GAIN
OR A WEEK OR NOMINATE APRIL THEN CONSERVATIVE WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY WORKING
ALMOST AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE RESULTS THEMSELVES EVIDENCE OF HOW PURCELL AND VICIOUS CAMPAIGN LIES AHEAD IN THE REST OF THE PRIMARIES AND IN THE ELECTION ITSELF
DONALD TRUMP HAD SET THE TONE WITH HIS ATTACK ON HILLARY CLINTON WHO MADE SOME WILL PROGRESS AGAINST THE STILL SURGING CAMPAIGN OF BERNIE SANDERS FROM THE LEFT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY
SAYING THAT SHE WAS A CRIMINAL WHO SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO BE A CANDIDATE
IT WAS POIGNANT EARLIER IN THE DAY AND VIRGINIA TO HEAR THE OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN CASEY WHO'S STAYING STUBBORNLY IN THE RACE LAMENTING THE CHARACTER OF THE CAMPAIGN YEAH I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY
AND WHY IS IT THAT WE HEAR THE POLITICS OF ANGLE
IN SALT THEN WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICAL PROCESS IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND YOU SHAKE YOUR HAIR
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S TURNING OUT IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS AND DONALD TRUMP'S LOVE THEIR VERBAL FISTICUFFS HAVE TURNED THIS INTO AN ELECTION THAT ISN'T JUST PASSIONATE BUT STRANGE
JAMES FALLOWS OF THE ATLANTIC WHO REMEMBERS CAMPAIGNS OVER TWO GENERATIONS KNOWS THAT THIS ONE
IT'S DIFFERENT SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE LAST TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS WHICH LEADS TO THE EXTREMES WERE NOW SEEING WITH A SINK YOU'RE LIKE A DONALD TRUMP WHO HAS ZERO GOVERNING EXPERIENCE BEING THERE MOST LIKELY NOMINEE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND MOST OF HIS COMPETITORS BEING TO HIS RATE OR AT LEAST NOT NOT BEING ACCESSIBLE HE REASONABLE AND SO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR PROBLEMS BUT WAS HER WITHIN THE RANGE OF NORMAL AMERICAN POLITICAL PROBLEMS THE REPUBLICAN PROBLEMS OR SOMETHING
WHAT HAPPENS OF TRUMPETS NOMINATE I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IT'S A COMBINED CONCERNED THAT HE'S NOT ACTUALLY REPUBLICAN SO IF HE DID WE AND WHAT WE DO AND ARTHUR'S COS I'LL JUST SAY OR DO ANYTHING AND THEN THE FACT THAT THAT HE MIGHT BRING A WHOLE LOT OF THE PARTY DOWN WITHIN THE SENATE MA'AM VERY LIKELY PERHAPS AS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
ON FORM HE WOULD SEEM TO BE THE WEAKEST PASSABLE GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE BUT BECAUSE HE'S HE VIOLATE ALL NORMAL RULES OF POLITICS YOU JUST DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE WEATHER IS CHANGING AND DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS HE'S CREATED A MOVEMENT
JOHN WILL BECK IS CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN VIRGINIA A SATURN SWING STATE IN NOVEMBER WHICH WENT DECISIVELY FOR TRUMP LAST NIGHT
AND HE SENSES ITS POWER
WHATEVER THE COST TO HIS OWN PARTY WHILE TRUG VICTORY HERE IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE ARE AS IMPORTANT AS WE ARE TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE WINNER HERE IS GOING TO HAVE A CLAIM TO A SWING STATE
AND SO ENOUGH RUBIO WINS HE'LL HAVE A CLAIM A SWING STATE WE HAVE A BIGGER PROFILE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION THAN MOST OTHER STATES IN FACT WILL WANT TO FIRE THAT WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST PROFILE SO I THINK WINNING VIRGINIA'S A BIG PRIZE FOR PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT HAVE THE MOST DELEGATES IT TELLS A LOT ABOUT YOUR YOUR GRASSROOTS ORGANISATION TELLS A LOT ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT TELLS A LOT ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO JUST TURN UP VOTERS AND I THINK YOU WANNA WIN VIRGINIA IF YOU WANT TO WIN THE WHITE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER
WELL YOU WANT A UNITED PARTY TO WIN THAT CAMPAIGNING YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE I MEAN MITT ROMNEY SAYS THAT HE THINKS
DONALD TRUMP DISQUALIFIED HIMSELF BY HIS ANSWERS ON THE COOK TUCKS CLAN ARE HE'S GOT ONE SENATOR WHO'S COME OUT IN HIS SUPPORT I MEAN THIS IS HOWEVER YOU LOOK AT IT A DIVIDED PARTY
I WOULD SAY IN I CAN I SPEAK TO VIRGINIA IN VIRGINIA I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED WITH OUR BUILDER HANG TOGETHER THROUGH ALL OF THIS I MEAN IT'S THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS IS A BIT OF A YEAR UNLIKE ANY OTHER AND THE VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN PARTY I MEAN I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I TALKED TO A CRUSTY PARTY LEADERS ACTIVISTS WHY NOT THEY MAY DISAGREE A CRUISE IN TROUBLE BUT I HAVE EVERY SINGLE PERSON SAY THEY'RE GOING TO REFUSE TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE IN NOVEMBER AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ALL WE CARE ABOUT QUITE TRUE
THAT HIS EXCITEMENT AND MANY SLEEPING VOTERS WHO ARE WAKING UP TO THE TRUMP CALL
BUT IT'S A CAMPAIGN THAT'S GOING TO BE UGLY AND BOTH PARTIES THINK IT IS A TURNING POINT FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE FOETUS THEREFORE UNTHINKABLE
THEY CARE AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS SET THE ARGUMENT A BLAZE
HERE ARE THE VOICES WHO WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY SHAPE THE AMERICAN FOR
AND I BET THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION
THE RHETORIC WE ARE HEARING AND THE OTHER SIDE HAS NEVER THEN
TRYING TO DIVIDE AMERICA BETWEEN US AND THEM IS WRONG AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAD
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOLKS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A GREAT AGAIN AND YOU KNOW WATCHED HILARY'S CHANGES TALKING ABOUT WAGES I'VE BEEN POURIN EVERYTHING'S POOR AND EVERYTHING'S DOING BADLY BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR SO LONG I MEAN IF SHE HAS STRAIGHTEN IT OUT BY NOW SHE'S NOT GOING TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IT'S JUST GOING TO BECOME WORSE AND WORSE SHE WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA WHOLE AGAIN AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IS GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN MAKING AMERICA HALL AGAIN AND REMEMBER THEY'VE ONLY JUST STARTED
YEAH THANKS VERY MUCH JIM OR ONE OF THE MANY MANY BIG QUESTIONS GYM TESTS ON IT THERE APART FROM THE OBVIOUS IS WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS CAN SURVIVE DONALD TRUMP AS IT WERE AFTER ALL HE HAS RUN A VERY ANTI ESTABLISHMENT CAMPAIGN LET'S TALK TO A LEADING REPUBLICAN KATE ANDREWS SHE SPEAKS FOR THE REPUBLICAN OVERSEAS ORGANISATION LET'S JUST ESTABLISH WHERE YOU STAND IN THE TRUMP STAKES FIRST ANDREWS YOU FOR HIM OR AGAINST HIM
I PERSONALLY WILL NOW BE SPREADING DONALD TRUMP OR NOT AS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AND NOT IN A GENERAL ELECTION MY DEEP FEAR IS THAT IN YOU QUESTION YOU JUST SOUTH OF REPUBLICANS GOING TO SUPPORT HIM IS GOING TO HELP THE PARTY OR HEARD THE PARTY IRRELIGIOUS DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK IF YOU ASK PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPORTERS OF TRAMP THE POINT OUT THAT HE IS BRED OUT NEW VOTERS HE'S BRIGHT EYED EXCITED PHOTOS HE IS UPPING VOTER TURNOUT LIKE WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME ESPECIALLY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
SO IN THAT SENSE REPUBLICANS ANXIOUS VOTING FOR AND THEY'RE EMBRACING HIM BUT REPUBLICANS LIKE MYSELF ARE CONCERNED IF WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP THE PARTY FOCUSED ON FREE MARKET ECONOMICS AND ECONOMICALLY LIBERALISING OUR COUNTRY AND GIVING PEOPLE MY FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN TO YOU AND TO HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEMSELVES MORE THAN DONALD TRUMP IS NOT A CANDIDATE HE IS THE BIG GOVERNMENT IN MY OPINION SOME WAYS VERY CRONY KIND OF CHARACTER
AND I SAID I'M NOT IMPRESSED BY THE FACT HE BRAGS ABOUT HAVING BUDDIED UP TO POLITICIANS WELL IN NEW YORK TO GET BUSINESS DEAL'S CLOSED YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE BIG IRONY IS THAT HE'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE INSIDER THAT'S PUTTING IT BUT THE FACT IS HE COULD DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS IT NOW STANDS COULDN'T IT I THINK YOU COULD CHANGE IT AS WE KNOW IT
AND I THINK THAT THIS NEW VOTER BASE THAT HE'S BRINGING IN A PEOPLE WHO OF COURSE HAVE THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CONSERVATIVE AND A CONSERVATORY AT THE CONSERVATIVES WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT IT'S MUCH MORE POPULIST SORT OF REACT THE HE'S GONE A FUN AND IT INCLUDES A LOT OF STATE SPENDING IT INCLUDES MARGINALISING OTHER PEOPLE AN OUTSIDER IS BLAMING THEM FOR SOME OF AMERICA'S PROBLEMS IN THE PAST DECADE
I CAN BE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THOSE WHO ARE SCEPTICAL OF OUTSIDE FORCES AND TWO THOSE WERE ANGRY THAT THE WASHINGTON RE HASN'T DONE ENOUGH FROM MIDDLE AMERICA TO GET THEM JOBS TO GET THEIR SALARIES UP MIDDLE AMERICA'S REALLY BEEN STAGNATING EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HOW THE ECONOMY'S GOTTEN BETTER OVER THERE WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY THERE SEE MY TRUMP IS POPULAR BUT I THINK SIMILAR ACTUALLY TO SENATOR BREE SAY UNDER
HE'S PROMISING A LOT OF THINGS THAT HE NEVER COULD ACTUALLY DELIVER TO TO HAVE A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A SINGLE SENATOR SINGLE REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHILE WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING THAT THOSE ENDORSEMENTS ARE GOING TO COME OUT MORE AND MORE NOW THAT HE HAS OBVIOUSLY GAINING MOMENTUM ISN'T DARKNESS ENDORSEMENT FROM GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY I THINK THAT MEANT A LOT CHRIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO TRAMP IN SOME WAYS THAT STREET PARKING NO NAN SENSE KIND OF PERSONALITY AND THEN TALLY BUT NOBODY SAW THAT COMING CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS HAD HIS UPS AND DOWNS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HE GOT INTO BIG TROUBLE A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN HE HUGGED PRESIDENT OBAMA FINE FIRE ON THE HALL HE HE WAS STARTING TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO BE THE CANDIDATE THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN WRAPPING INSTEAD OF MITT ROMNEY
AND THAT WAS IT THERE WAS A BIG INTEREST NEVER HIMMEL SEYMOUR SO IT MAY BE AT THAT IN THE END THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT MAY NEVER COME TO LOVE DONALD TRUMP BUT THEY WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY WON'T BE COME TO X. ABOUT THEY'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT HIM IF THAT'S IF THAT'S IF HE GETS THE DELEGATES THAT'S IT WELL I SAY STAY TUNED ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT LAST NIGHT AS THAT YES DONALD TRUMP ONE I WOULD SAY HE SWEPT THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE
AND HE CAME OUT WITH BETTER PERCENTAGES AND HE'S HAD BEFORE STILL NO MAJORITY WINFREY DONALD TRUMPETERS PLA AUDIS ARE REALLY GROWING IN PLACES LIKE MASSACHUSETTS HE CAME VERY CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE VOTE BUT SHE'S NOT THAT FAR AHEAD IN THE DELICATE COUNT WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT THIS RACE IS THAT WELL THE MAJORITY OF CANDIDATE STAYING IN IS HARMING PEOPLE LEGS YOUR AMERICA RUBIO BY TED CREWS WHO COULD TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP AFFAIR WITH ONLY ONE LAUGHTER
THE DIVIDING OF THE DELICATE IS NOW WE'RE SEEING HERDING DONALD TRUMP A LITTLE BIT AS WELL ABOUT A THIRD OF THE DELEGATES HAVE BEEN DISHED OUT SO FAR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN ORDER TO BE SECURE GOING INTO CONVENTION NEED OVER ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TUNNEL CHAMPERS ONLY AROUND THREE HUNDRED HE'S GOT A LONG WAY TO GO
WE'VE GOT WHAT A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE FLORIDA THOSE ARE BIGGIES THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT IN AND THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH FOR ALMOST EVERY CANDIDATE TO STAY IN THE RACE IF THEY DON'T HAVE SOME MASSIVE WHEN ESPECIALLY SENATOR MARK OR REPEAL IF YOU LOSE AS HIS HOME STATE FLORIDA THAT THAT'S YOU CAN'T COME BACK FROM THAT CRUISE DID VERY WELL LAST NIGHT TOO WENT ACCESS HE HAS PROVED HE HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY IN THIS RACE ABOUT WILD ANGER I JUST WEAR WHETHER OCCASIONALLY YOU STAND IN FRONT OF YOUR BEDROOM MIRROR AND PRACTISE SAYING PRESIDENT TRUMP
I DON'T PRACTISE I MEAN IT DOESN'T ROCK MY LOVES VERY EASILY I HAVE I DON'T FARE TO SIT AN IN TRUMP IS NOT UNSTOPPABLE BUT MY DEEPEST DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A DEMOCRAT MAY BE THE ONE TO STOP HIM NOW ALL RIGHT SADIE RATHER OVER ENGLAND THERE SHE IS AFTER ALL A WOMAN YOU'VE NEVER HAD A WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS APPALLING ISN'T IT WELL WE HAVEN'T AND I THINK LIKE EVERY AMERICAN WOMAN OUT THERE I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE FIRST DAY THAT WE HAVE WON
BUT I DO YOU NOW BELIEVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON REPRESENTS THE KIND OF WOMAN THAT I WANT TO HAVE IN THE PRESIDENCY HER PERSONALITY HER WRECKER AND FRANKLY FOR A SCANDAL RIDIN RECORD AND HER HER PAST LIFE AND YOU WORK IN D. C.
THAT THOSE THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN SIMPLY THE FACT THAT SHE'S A WOMAN AT AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THAT HURDLE BUT I DON'T WANT HER TO BE THE ONE TO REPRESENT IT KATE ANDREWS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE SHALL KNOW THEY'LL BE TALKING AGAIN BEFORE NOVEMBER THANK YOU I THINK IT'S TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST EIGHT SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THE GENE RESPONSIBLE FOR GREY
IT'S CALLED I R. F. FOR AND WHAT IT DOES IS REGULATE MELANIN THE PIGMENT BEHIND HAIR COLOUR AS WELL AS THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN AND EYES SAID CAN WE SWITCH IT OFF AND STOP OURSELVES GOING GREY WELL ONE OF THE SENIOR AUTHORS OF THE STUDY BEHIND THIS RESEARCH IS PROFESSOR DESMOND TOME AND TOBIN WHO'S DIRECTOR OF THE SCENT OF HER SKIN SCIENCES AT BRADFORD UNIVERSITY HE JOINS US FROM DUBLIN AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY EMMA SOAMES'S EDITOR AT LARGE OF SAGA MAGAZINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING PROFESSOR TABLE IT SOUNDS LIKE QUITE A DISCOVERY CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS OF HOW IT WORKS RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS SIT THIS STUDY WAS LED BY U.C.L. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT A VERY MIXED POPULATION OF PEOPLE IN SOUTH AMERICA
HOW DIFFERENT ANCESTRY IS FROM AFRICA AND ASIA AND EUROPE AND IN THAT MIXTURE THEY WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PICK OUT QUITE A HOT ACTUALLY MAPPED ONTO THERE ARE PHYSICAL FEATURES SO THIS PARTICULAR GENE THIS IO ALL OF FOUR IT'S A VARIATION ON THAT GENE THAT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREYING SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO REALLY NEXT IS TO LOOK AT THE PROTEIN THAT THAT GENE AND CODES FOR AND SEE WHAT THAT VARIANT IS ACTUALLY DOING TO THE FUNCTION OF THAT PROTEIN FOR EXAMPLE IS IT REDUCING THE SURVIVAL OF PIGMENT CELLS
OVER TIME IN IN IN OUR HAIR FOLLICLES OR IS IT LEADING TO OTHER SOME STRESSFUL SIGNAL THAT THESE CELLS ARE EXPERIENCING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT VARIANT OF THE GENE SO IF WE DO KNOW THAT AND WE AND IF WE FIND THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO BACK FILLED THAT MISSING ELEMENT OF THE FUNCTION OF THATCHING I DON'T NORMALLY WOULD NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH GROWING SO BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS GENE DOES WE CAN FOLLOW THE CHAIN OF EVENTS AND PERHAPS ADD OUR OWN INTERVENTION
YES IT'S LIKE A FIRST DOMINO SO WE'D BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MAPPED NAILED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT VARIATION AND PARTICULARLY AS IT IMPACTS THE AGEING PROCESS OF THIS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A MIRROR INTO GENERAL AGEING AS WELL BECAUSE SOME OF THE SAME MECHANISMS MAY BE OCCURRING IN THE AGEING OF THE HAIR FOLLICLE AS IN THE EDGING OF OTHER TISSUES OF THE BODY WERE YOU CAN WE CAN SWITCH OFF WRINKLES
WELL I MEAN GREY HAIR IS STILL PROBABLY THE MOST DRAMATIC HALLMARK OF A DISAPPEARING YOUTH AND HER FOLLICLE IS AN APPENDAGE OF THE SKIN THAT COMES OUT OF THE SKIN IT'S MADE UP OF CELLS ARE ALSO FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE SKIN SO IT IS ALL ONE UNIT AFTER ALL SO IT WILL GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THE APPEARANCE OF AGEING EFFECTS OVER TIME
LET ME BRING IN EMMA'S SOAMES HERE BECAUSE THAT GRAIN EFFECT THERE WAS SOME STATISTIC THE OTHER DAY ABOUT HOW MANY WOMEN IT WAS FOCUSING ON BUT IT'S TRUE OF MEN TO WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE GREY HAIR WELL YES I THINK IT MAKES PEOPLE CERTAINLY AMONG WOMEN DON'T WANT GREAT KAREN IT IS ANOTHER
THE G. THAT PRODUCES GREAT BUT THEN YOU
IS THAT RIGHT PROFESSOR TOBA NINE SO IT WAS MELANIE IT'S NOT IS IT YES ACTUALLY THERE ARE TWO SIMILAR SOUNDING ENTITIES MEL MELATONIN IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS IS LINKED TO WEE A WEE REGULATOR WE CAN ALL REST IN OUR BEDS ON THAT ONE YES I KNOW PROFESSOR JOB AND IT DOES IT PROVIDE OR DOES HE PRESENT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ALTERNATIVE TO DYING YOUR HAIR I MEAN HOW HOW COULD IT WORK
IF IF THIS VARIATION IN THE GENE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INSTABILITY IN THE CELLS THAT MAKE PIGMENT AND WERE ABLE TO CORRECT THAT INSTABILITY WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN NATURAL PIGMENTATION IN THE HAIR FOLLICLE FOR LONGER BECAUSE ACROSS THE POPULATION WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO CAN RETAIN THEIR PIGMENT FOR
SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS ANOTHER IS THAT LOSER ALREADY IN THAT IN THE TWENTIES SO WE DO KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RETAIN NATURAL PIGMENT IN THEIR HAIR FOR FOR MANY MANY DECADES LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON MAY EXPERIENCE IT SO THERE IS THERE IS MACHINERY THERE AS LONG AS WE CAN ENSURE THAT IT'S HOT TAMALE FUNCTION BUT WE'RE TAKING A PILL OR RUBBING YOUR CREAM AND OUR HEADS IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I THINK PERHAPS IF YOU COULD INTRODUCE IT FROM OUTSIDE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO HANDLE THEM ACTUALLY TAKING INSIDE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY CHANGES THAT OCCUR WHEN YOU TAKE SOMETHING INTO YOUR BODY AND IT CAN IMPACT MULTIPLE TARGETS EMMA SENDS I'M I'M SITTING BETWEEN TWO MEN WHO ARE BOTH GREY WELL EASY FOR YOU TO FLEECE AND YET PEOPLE DO I SUPPOSE IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN OF GETTING OLDER OR THE LOSS OF YOUTH I WAS GREAT AT TWENTY EIGHT
AND WHEN A WOMAN GOES GREY WELL I WON'T I WON'T YOU WOULDN'T BE SORT OF GOODS GOOD MANNERS TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY MIGHT BE
POPULARLY WOMEN ANY WAY FEEL
EVER SPEAK TO THEM EVER AGAIN HE GREY AND PROUD THAT'S THE ANSWER OR DIE IT'S THAT VERY WEALTHY
IT'S JUST A FINAL THOUGHT THEY FROM PROFESSOR TOBIN THIS IS POTENTIALLY HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR ANNA VERY COMMERCIAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR A HUGE SECTOR OF THE MARKET
AS THE POPULATION AGES WE KIND OF DON'T INTERVENE COSMETICALLY MORE AND MORE IN OUR CHANGING APPEARANCE SO I DO THINGS ANY RISK RIGHT NOW FOR US AT THE MAJOR SHIFT IN PEOPLE'S PRACTICES BUT IT DOES GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO HOW PERHAPS HOW WOULD TO IDENTIFIED FUTURE TARGETS FOR COSMETIC INTERVENTION PERHAPS PROFESSOR DESMOND TOBIN AND EMMA SO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH OUT OF THE SILVER FOXES
YES WELL SILVER FOX OR SALT AND PEPPER THERE A EUPHEMISM BUT OTHER OH PERHAPS WE COULD TRY THAT ONE NO NO FAIR ENOUGH FIVE PREMIER LEAGUE MATCHES TODAY INCLUDING WEST HAM AGAINST SPURS WILL GO TOP OF THE PREMIER LEAGUE IF THEY WIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE CURRENTLY DOES LEICESTER CITY FAILED TO BEAT WEST BROMWICH ALBION LAST NIGHT INSTEAD DRAWING TWO ALL IT WAS QUITE A GAME

OBVIOUSLY SIX POINTS WOULD'VE BEEN HUNT THEY FIGHTING TO BE PRETTY PLEASED US ALL FROM LAST FRIDAY NIGHT SOMEWHERE YEAH MANAGER CLAUDIO RANIERI SAID I DON'T SEE THE TITLE I JUST WATCH MY TEA SOLD ANOTHER STRATEGY TO WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT DOESN'T IT I THINK THAT THESE KIND OBVIOUSLY JUST TO PLAY AT ALL THEY'RE IN SUCH A POSITION THAT OBVIOUSLY CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOOTBALL FOR A START THINGS AND
WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS IT IT'S REMARKABLE ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE
BUT QUESTION EVERY SINGLE DAY I THINK YOU THINK I THINK YOU SO IN THIS SLEEPY AND YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER DANCE AND HE CAN COME UP
JUST FANTASTIC AND HE DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT YES MARVIN AT THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE ONE OF YOUR FORMER CLUBS ASTON VILLA APPEARS DOOMED IT SEEMS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE I SUPPOSE WITH THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM SHOULD LACK REPRESENTATION IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE

MAKES JOHN HUMPHRYS LOOK LIKE A TEMP JOINED US JUST AFTER NINE THINGS LIVIA THE WEATHER COLD AND BLUSTERY WINTRY SHOWERS MOVING SOUTH YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND SARAH MONTAGUE IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE LET'S HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CAROLINE NICHOLS
THE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP AND THE DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BOTH TAKEN MAJOR STEPS TOWARDS CLAIMING THEIR PARTIES NOMINATIONS IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE SO FAR THEY HAVE EACH TAKEN SEVEN OF THE ELEVEN STATES BEING CONTESTED ON THE DAY KNOWN AS SUPER TUESDAY
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET OUT A NEW ASSESSMENT OF THE DANGERS IT SAYS THE U.K. WILL FACE IF IT LEAVES THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FOREIGN SECRETARY PHILIP HAMMOND TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT ARRANGEMENTS THE E.U. HAS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES WOULD NOT WORK FOR BRITAIN DOMINIC ROB HE'S A JUSTICE MINISTER AND A CAMPAIGNER FOR BRECHT'S IT ACCUSED THE IN CAMPAIGN OF SCAREMONGERING
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PREPARING TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF POUNDS ON HUMANITARIAN AID OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO HELP GRACE COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS PLANS WILL BE PUT FORWARD TODAY BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
AIRLINE PILOTS ARE CALLING FOR TESTS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A DRONE OR TO HIT A PLANE THEIR UNION WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO HELP PAY FOR RESEARCH DOCTORS ACADEMICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE U.K. AND IRELAND TO BAN TACKLING IN SCHOOL RUGBY MATCHES THEY HAVE WARNED THAT THERE'S A RISK OF SERIOUS INJURIES
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES TO NINE THE POLICE ARE TO HAVE MORE POWERS TO SEE WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE INTERNET AND THE MESSAGES WE'VE SENT ONLINE THE FORMAL TITLE FOR THE BILL THAT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY IS THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL BUT IT'S BEEN CALLED THE SNOOPERS CHARTER THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SAYS IT NOW CONTAINS A GREATER LEGAL SAFEGUARDS TO STOP UNWARRANTED INTRUSION BUT ONE OF HER PREDECESSORS THE FORMER SHADOW HOME SECRETARY DAVID DAVIS IS DESCRIBED AS AN ATTACK ON THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY
SO WHICH IS IT WHILE NIGER PINXTON IS DIRECTOR OF FUTURE CONFLICT AND CYBER SECURITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL IT'S CHIEF THE STRATEGIC STUDIES HE USED TO BE ASSISTANT CHIEF OF M.I.SIX NEWS HERE IN THE STUDIO WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS BILL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT WELL AFTER A SERIES OF REVIEWS OF INTERCEPT PRACTICES IN THE U.K. ALL OF WHICH FOUND THAT THESE ACTIVITIES WERE NECESSARY LAWFUL
AND DID NOT CONSTITUTE MASS SURVEILLANCE AND EVERYBODY HIS LOOKS THIS HAS COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREPARED TO INVEST POLITICAL CAPITAL IN THIS NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND IT'S SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY WAS NEEDED
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION UNDER WHICH THIS IS DONE AT THE MOMENT HAS A SUNSET CLAUSE ENDS AT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SOMETHING HAS TO REPLACE IT BUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE IS TAKEN DAVID ANDERSON Q.C.S RECOMMENDATIONS TO TO CONSOLIDATE IN ONE SINGLE PLACE ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF LEGISLATION UNDER WHICH INTERCEPTION IS UNDERTAKEN AND IT SETS OUT WITH I THINK REMARKABLE DETAIL AND CLARITY WHAT HE'S DONE HOW IT IS DONE WHY IT HAS DONE AND TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE
WHAT THE OPERATIONAL INTRICATE RESULTS OF DOING IT ACTUALLY AMOUNT AGAIBH BUT DOES IT CHANGE ANYTHING FOR WHAT THE SECURITY SERVICES ARE POLICE DO FOR THE POLICE THERE IS THIS NEW POWER TO ENABLE REQUIRE COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO RETAIN INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS FOR A YEAR BUT OTHERWISE NO THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL POWERS BEING SOUGHT IN THIS BILL IT IS SIMPLY
A MEANS OF CONSOLIDATING MAKING CLEARER AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT SAFEGUARDS FOR WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION JAMES BLESSING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY WHEN HE MADE THE POINT ABOUT THE SCALE OF IT WHETHER YOU CAN DO IT EFFICIENTLY BUT ALSO WHETHER IT CAN BE KEPT SAFE KEEPING THAT NAT MUCH REP IT'S VERY EASY TO HAGGLE TO TRY AND GET DETAILS FROM YOU ABOUT YOUR BANKING AND THEN USE THAT TO TRY AND TAKE MONEY FROM YOU IS OLD MISSUS B. IT IS IT SAFE
ALL DATA IS POTENTIALLY AT RISK OF INTRUSIVE HACKING OR THEFT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT THIS IS JUST THE WAY THE INTERNET WORKS MODERN COMMUNICATIONS WORK SO SO YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTELY NO RISK OPTION BUT THE RISKS IN THIS CASE A CLEAR AND I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO PUT IN PLACE
PLENTY OF SAFEGUARDS AND TO MITIGATE THIS RISK AND I DON'T SEE THAT WILL RELY ON THE COMPUTER COMPANIES INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS INVESTING WON'T IT WELL TO A DEGREE YES IT WILL BUT THEY'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM CONSULTATIONS AND ADVICE FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS TO POTENTIAL THREATS AND WAYS IN WHICH TO MITIGATE THEM RIGHT BUT LIKELY TO MEAN EXTRA COSTS ON EVERYBODY ELSE BUT POTENTIALLY YES DAVID DAVIS THERE WAS I SAID I MEAN HE'D SENT DESCRIBED IT AS AN ATTACK ON THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS IT'S A SNOOPING
WELL IT'S NOT A POWER SNOOPING POINT SNOOPING POWER GRAB WOULD IMPLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPACITIES AND POWERS AND THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT AS I SAID THERE'S BILL IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE AND CLARIFY WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE
AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE DOUBLE LOCK SO HOME SECRETARY SIGNS A WARRANT FOR TARGETED MONITORING OF COMMUNICATIONS BUT THAT WARRANT CAN ONLY NOW BE ENACTED IF A JUDGE HAS REVIEWED IT IN DEEMS IT DEEMS IT LEGAL SO THERE ARE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS HERE AND WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT STUFF THAT IS NOT IN CRYPTIC
THERE IS A PROBLEM IN A SENSE IN THERE I'LL BE THE BATTLE OVER ENCRYPTION THAT WITCHES SCRAMBLED EFFECTIVELY BETWEEN SENDING AND RECEIVING THE SECURITY SERVICES HAVE HAVE NO WAY INTO THAT DO THEY WELL THE PANEL IS LOST
I THINK YOUR ENCRYPTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS AS YOU SAID BECOME A MAJOR FEATURE OF MODERN COMMUNICATIONS AND THIS IS BY AND LARGE IT IS A GOOD THING WE ALL NEED THIS YEAR WE WANT OUR PERSONAL DATA ARE BANKING DETAILS CREDIT CARDS ET-CETERA TO BE BETTER PROTECTED THAN THEY EVER TO HAVE BEEN
AND IN THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT REQUIRING PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES TO MAKE ACCESS ALL ENCRYPTION TO OUTLAW END TO END ENCRYPTION OR TO BUILD BACK DOORS INTO SYSTEM SO THAT
AGENCIES CAN GET GET IN AND DECRYPT ACTIVITIES I THINK THERE IS AN ACCEPTANCE THAT IN SOME AREAS THIS THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT MONITORING COMMUNICATIONS DOESN'T STILL DELIVER SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL BENEFITS NOW DRINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES TO NINE WE'VE HAD A HUGE REACTION TO THAT PIECE WE DID
A GOOD DEBATE WE HAD AT HER BAR SEVEN ABOUT WORTH WHETHER TACKLING SHOULD BE BANNED IN RUGBY IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS A HUGE RESPONSE ALMOST OVERWHELMINGLY SAYING DO NOT VALID FEW TYPICAL EXAMPLE STEVE JACKSON I PLAYED RUGBY AT SCHOOL FROM ELEVEN TO EIGHTEEN WHAT DID I SUFFER CONCUSSION A BROKEN NOSE BROKEN COLLARBONE LOTS AND LOTS OF BRUISES QUITE A FEW CUTS WHAT DO I GAIN A LOT OF PERSONAL AND PHYSICAL CONFIDENCE A LOT OF FUN
JAKE FLETCHER SAYS IT'S BANNING IT WOULD BE UNLEASHING THIRTEEN STONE PLUS HUMAN BEINGS UPON THE WORLD WAS ONLY RELEASE OF AGGRESSION IS THE RUGBY FIELD EDWARD BURKE I'D SPEND A LIFETIME INVOLVED WITH RUGBY AND MY SON PLEASED TOO I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO'S BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT I DO KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT DRIVING OR DRIVING HORSE RIDING RIDING A BICYCLE
ALAN ALAN SAYS IF RUGBY'S DANGEROUS WE SHOULD STOP BY THE SPORTS JUDO KARATE ICE SKATING HORSERIDING HOW FAR DO YOU TAKE THIS AND RICHARD PRICE SAYS WHY DON'T WE WRAP ALL THE PLAYERS IN BUBBLE WRAP AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON ITS COURSE TONIGHT
A LOT OF PRESSURE IS BUILDING ON SAUDI ARABIA TO STOP WHAT IT'S DOING IN YEMEN VAST NUMBERS OF CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE CIVIL WAR THAT'S BEEN RAGING FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS MANY OF THEM IN AIR STRIKES LAUNCHED BY THE SAUDIS OVER THE PAST YEAR OUR DEFENCE CHORISTER SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FORGIVE ME IS FRANK GARDNER FRANK
GOOD MORNING JOHN YES I MEAN THIS IS LARGELY AN UNSEEN WAR IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF IT THAT HAS HAD VERY LITTLE ATTENTION IS THE WESTERN INVOLVEMENT IN THAT THE SUPPLIER NOT ONLY OF PLANES BUT OF SOME OF THE MUNITIONS BEING USED
AND RECENTLY I WAS AT THE MINI SECURITY CONFERENCE AND I WAS ABLE TO ASK MICHAEL FALLON THE DEFENCE SECRETARY WHAT BRITISH SERVICEMEN OR DOING WHAT PART THEY'VE GOT IN THIS SAUDI LED OPERATION
WE HAVE BRITISH OFFICERS INVOLVED IN TRAINING AND AND ADVICE TO THE SIDE SAUDI THE SAUDI
ARMED FORCES BUT THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN ADVISING ON THE SELECTION OR APPROVAL OF OFF TARGETS IN THE WAR IN
ON THE CONTRARY THEY'RE THERE TO SUPPORT THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE SUPPLIED
BUT YOU MUST BE FEELING A BIT UNEASY THAT SOME OF THAT EQUIPMENT THAT'S BEING SUPPLIED ALL SUDDENLY AIRCRAFT TO DELIVER IT
IS ENDING UP HITTING HOSPITALS WHICH THE SAUDIS HAVE NOW ADMITTED AND CIVILIAN TARGETS AS A PART OF THEIR WIDER CAMPAIGN WHETHER OR NOT THOSE STRIKES WERE DELIBERATE
WE HAVE SOME OF THE STRICTEST ARMS CONTROL CRITERIA IN THE WORLD BEFORE WE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT TO ANYBODY INCLUDING OBVIOUSLY A KEY ALLIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS INSIST THAT THEY NOT ONLY COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT
AND HE GOES ON TO THERE TO DEFEND THE ROLE THE SAUDIS AND I LISTENED TO ONLY TWO DAYS AGO TWO MAIN SPOKESMAN IN RIYADH BRIGADIER GENERAL UP AT LAST HIT IT THEY ABSOLUTELY DENY TARGETING DELIBERATELY TARGETING ANY CIVILIANS
YOU GET A RATHER DIFFERENT VIEW ON THE GROUND FROM PEOPLE AND I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO THE YEMENI RESEARCH OR SOME ALL THE WHILE AND MCAFEE WHO'S SPENT TIME ON THE GROUND IN YEMEN AND TALKS REGULARLY TO PEOPLE THERE I ASKED HER WHAT ORDINARY YEMENIS THINK ABOUT THE WEST THE U.K. AND U.S. ROLE IN THIS WAR
YOU SEE BILLBOARDS ALL OVER THE NORTH OF THE M. M. PER SAYING THAT IT'S USE U.S. AND U.K. BOMBS THAT OUR BOMBING CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY WHERE ON THE GROUND OF THAT OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE U.K. AND U.S. IN THIS WAY WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF THIS CAMPAIGN
THE LONG TERM EFFECT IS WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IN YEMEN IS NOT ONLY OUR CIVILIAN STAYING IN IS THE COUNTRY IN A COMPLETE STANDSTILL BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS YOUTH JOINING GROUPS LIKE ARCADE IN THE RAVE IN PENINSULA AND ISLAMIC STATES AND FOR ME THAT'S THE SCARY YOU KNOW THE RHEA
THAT WAS NO WELL MIKE HAFFI REALLY THERE ARE TWO POLARISED SIDES THIS BUT I THINK THE WORRY HERE IS AND I'VE SAID THIS DIRECTLY TO THE SAUDIS THE LONGER THIS WAR GOES ON WITHOUT ANY CLEAR WINNER WITHOUT THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW
THE GREATER THE RISK THAT EXTREMIST GROUPS LIKE AL KINDER AND MORE RECENTLY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ARE GOING TO PROFIT FROM THE CHAOS AND GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER AND BUILD THEMSELVES A MINI STATE AND POTS OF THAT TROUBLED COUNTRY
FRANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED FOR THAT TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST INVESTMENT FIRM HAS WARNED THAT THE RISKS OF A U.K. EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION MORE THAN OUTWEIGH THE REWARDS OF IT TANYA BECKETT HAS MORE TANYA YES HELLO ONCE AGAIN WELL THIS IS THE VERDICT OF BLACK ROCK THE WORLD'S BIGGEST ASSET MANAGER IT SAYS BRICKS IT WOULD LEAD TO LOWER U.K. GROWTH AND INVESTMENT
UNEMPLOYMENT AND A STRAIN ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES RIBBIT HARRISON IS FROM BLACK ROCK AND HE'S ALSO FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE WELCOME TO YOU THE MOMENT HE'S READING THROUGH YOUR REPORT IS WE DON'T HAVE MUCH ACCESS ACCESS TO INFORMATION CONCERNING A BRECK SIP SCENARIO SO IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO MAKE THIS JUDGEMENT AND AS AN INVESTOR TYPICALLY YOU DON'T WANT ANY CHANGE
I THINK THAT UNCERTAINTY IN THE SHORT TIME AS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT AND IN FACT THE SHORT TERM IMPACT IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST THING TO GET A HANDLE ON I THINK THAT HAS PRETTY WIDESPREAD AS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE A PRETTY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BUSINESS INVESTMENT PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THAT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WOULD FOLLOW
WE THINK STIRLING WOULD FALLS OF THE CURRENCY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT WOULD MEAN HIGHER INFLATION AND OVERALL WE THINK WE SEE IN THE SHORT TERM A PRETTY NEGATIVE IMPACT FOR THE ECONOMY I THINK WE ARE RIGHT IN THE LONGER TERM AS MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN BECAUSE IT DEPENDS SO MUCH ON WHAT THE MODEL OF A POST
EXIT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST THE OPINION IT WOULD BE BUT WE GO IN THE REPORT WE GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT MODELS AND IT'S QUITE HARD TO TO TO STACK UP A SCENARIO THAT'S A LONG TERM BUT ALSO WHAT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO SEE THE LONG TERM NEGATIVE RIGHT BUT WHAT YOU ALSO DON'T DESCRIBE AS THE FACT THAT THE E.U. IS SOMETHING WHICH IS CONTINUING TO FORM OBVIOUSLY ITS INITIAL BRIEF WAS TO BE A TRAY BLOCK BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT NOW AND THE INTENTION IS THAT IT WOULD BECOME
EVEN MORE THAN THAT AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE Y. YOU REALLY ONE HAS TO CONSIDER WHAT IT AIMS TO BECOME RATHER THAN WHAT IT IS NOW WELL I GUESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE OPINION I THINK PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART WILL BE FURTHER INTEGRATION OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE EUROZONE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A AGREEMENT WITHIN THE EUROZONE I'M AROUND THE WORLD THAT THEY NEED TO DO MORE TO MAKE THAT CURRENCY IN A LONG TERM A VIABLE AND STABLE CURRENCY
I GUESS PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR MIND ABOUT WHETHER THE SAFEGUARDS OF THE PRIME MINISTER ACHIEVED IN THEIR RENEGOTIATION AROUND NON DISCRIMINATION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE BASIS OF CURRENCY IN AN EMERGENCY BREAK FOR NON EUROZONE COUNTRIES IF THEY THINK THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE BEING PUT AT THREAT WHETHER THAT SAFEGUARDS US BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT THAT BRITAIN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SET UP TRADE DEALS
FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT IT HAS NOW SURELY IS IS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE HIM WITHIN THE INTERESTS AND E. UINE YOU EVEN HIGH LIKE THIS WITHIN YOUR REPORT THAT IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE E.U. NOT TO SET THOSE UP WITH BRITAIN WELL I THINK IT MUCH DEPENDS PRECISELY ON THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE ON OFFER IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE SINGLE MARKET LIKE COUNTRIES LIKE NORWAY
OR IF YOU WANT TO HAVE PARTIAL ACCESS THE SINGLE MARKET LIKE SWITZERLAND THEY'RE A QUID PRO QUO IS AND THAT PROBABLY INVOLVES ACCEPTING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND PROBABLY CONTRIBUTIONS THE E.U. BUDGET THE REALITY OF MODERN TRADE IS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE ST SOMETHING LIKE THE SUPERMARKET ANY KIND OF TRADE DEAL THROUGH THE W.T.O. DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU THE SAME KIND OF AXIS IT HARRISON DOMES LEAVE IT THANK YOU TONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NINE MINUTES TO NINE
THE WAY A DOCTOR OR NURSE SPEAKS TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE A PATIENT CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE NOT ONLY TO THE WAY YOU FEEL BUT ALSO TO YOUR TREATMENT AND ITS COST
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE CANCER CHARITY MARIE CURIE IT'S WARNING THAT POOR COMMUNICATION IN THE N.H.S. IS DAMAGING PATIENT CARE AND WASTING AS MUCH AS A BILLION POUNDS IN ENGLAND ALONE
ITS REPORT WAS PRODUCED BY ANDREW MACDONALD HE USED TO RUN IPSA THE INDEPENDENT PARLIAMENTARY STANDARDS AUTHORITY BUT NOW HE HAD PROSTATE CANCER AND PARKINSON'S
I'VE HAD BRILLIANT TECHNICAL CARE FOR BOTH PARKINSON'S AND
PROSTATE CANCER BUT IN TERMS OF MY CANCER TREATMENT I'VE EXPERIENCED BOTH THE BEST OF COMMUNICATION AND THE WORST AND I BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT MY EXPERIENCE WAS OF WIDER APPLICATION WEATHER AND OTHERS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME DIFFICULTIES AS I'D HAD AND THE COMMUNICATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS LITERALLY THE WAY YOU WERE TOLD ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING YES ONLY VARIED FROM FOR EXAMPLE ONE OCCASION WHEN MY USUAL CONSULTANT WASN'T AVAILABLE ON ONE THINGS I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IS CONTINUITY OF CARE
MY USUAL CONSULTANT WASN'T AVAILABLE I SAW SOMEBODY ELSE SHE HADN'T READ THE FILE AND SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD GREAT NEWS FOR ME THAT MY P.S.A. THAT'S THE BLOOD MARKER FOR PROSTATE CANCER WAS ONLY FOUR POINT TWO
I KNEW THIS WAS VERY BAD NEWS AND MY CASE
SHE'S GOT CONFUSED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I HAD AN OPERATION A PROSPECT TO ME SHE LEFT THE ROOM SHE CAME BACK AND SAID YOU'RE RIGHT YOU HAVE HAD THIS OPERATION SO THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS AND I QUOTE IT WILL BE VERY VERY FATAL IN YOUR CASE AND SHE PREDICTED I HAD LESS THAN A YEAR TO LIVE
THAT SORT OF CONFUSION ARISING FROM A FAILURE TO REPAIR AND A FAILURE TO LISTEN TO THE PATIENT CAN BE DEVASTATING
I MEAN CLEARLY THERE IS IT'S BECAUSE IT WAS A CRASS WAY OF HAND SOMETHING IN A MISTAKE BUT YOU GO FURTHER AND ARGUING THAT ACTUALLY THIS COSTS THE N.H.S. HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY
ABSOLUTELY IT COSTS WE COULD WE THINK MORE THAN A BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IN ENGLAND ALONE IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE N.H.S. ITSELF HASN'T DONE THE MATHS TO WORK OUT WHAT THE PRECISE FIGURE IS SO ONE HAS TO ASK HOW SERIOUSLY DOES THE N.H.S. TAKE THIS QUESTION
YOU KNOW I WORK WE'VE LOOKED OUT COMPARATIVE STUDIES AND WE LOOKED AT THE COST OF WASTE ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULAR CONDITIONS BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE WAY IN WHICH WASTE ARISES
IF PATIENTS DON'T TAKE THEIR MEDICATION BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD INSTRUCTIONS AND END UP WITH A HUGE WASTED MEDICATION BILL IF PATIENTS COME BACK
AS FOR EXAMPLE I DID AFTER THAT ENCOUNTER WITH THE DOCTOR WHO TOLD ME SOMETHING COULD BE VERY VERY FATAL COME BACK FOR ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WHICH STRICTLY SPEAKING MIGHT NOT BE NEEDED THEN WASTE ARISES
AND VERY OFTEN DISPUTES ARISE FROM POOR COMMUNICATION THE N.H.S. IN ENGLAND THIS YEAR ALONE WILL HAVE A BILLION LIMP ALL OVER BILL OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS FOR CLAIMS BY PATIENTS AND THAT ISN'T DOESN'T ALL ARISE FROM PORK IMPATIENS BUT A GOOD SHARE IT DOES
ANDREW MACDONALD SPEAKING TO ME ABOUT HIS REPORT FOR MARIE CURIE THE TIME IS NOW NEARLY FIVE TO NINE IT USED TO BE SO SIMPLE FILM STARS WERE HEROES OR HELL RAISERS AT LEAST THE MEN WERE THE WOMEN WERE FRAGRANT AND BEAUTIFUL NOW THEY HAVE TO BE SEEN TO BE VIRTUOUS AS WELL AND DARE ONE SAY IT EVEN JUST A LITTLE POLITICALLY CORRECT THE OSCARS CEREMONY ON SUNDAY NIGHT WAS A PARADE OF GOODY TWO SHOES ALL VYING WITH EACH OTHER TO SHOW WHAT THEY DO THAT THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT
WAS NOT WINNING SOME TAWDRY AWARD BUT MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR THOSE WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE THAN THEMSELVES WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE WHEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT TOO CYNICAL LET US DISCUSS IT WITH THE JOURNALIST TOLD THE FORMER CONTRIBUTING EDITOR HE WAS THE FORMER CONTRIBUTING HERE'S A FORMER CONTRIBUTED AT VANITY FAIR ANDREA DYLAN WHO IS A FILM CRITIC TOBY
YEAH IT WAS I THOUGHT EVEN MORE BORING THAN USUAL IT WAS A VIRTUE SIGNALLING MARATHON WE HAD LADY GARGLE SINGING A SONG ABOUT CAMPUS RAPE AND CLAIMING ON THE RED CARPET THAT ONE IN FIVE FEMALE AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD EXPECT TO BE RAPED AT UNIVERSITY IN FACT THE REAL FIGURE IS SIX POINT ONE IN A THOUSAND WE HAD SAM SMITH DEVOTING HIS OSCAR FOR THE GOD AWFUL SONG HE SANG INSPECTOR TO THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY AND CLAIMING TO BE THE FIRST
OUT GAY MAN TO WIN AN OSCAR IN FACT THAT WAS JOHN GILL GOODE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE BEFORE HE WAS BORN AND THEN AT THE FINALE OF THE NIGHT WE HAD LEO TO CAT PRAYER DEVOTING HIS OSCAR TO THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD HE SAID HE WOULDN'T TAKE FOR GRANTED EVEN THOUGH HE THEN WENT OFF TO PARTY WITH ONE OF THE STARS IN MADE IN CHELSEA AND THEN PRESUMABLY GOT ON HIS PRIVATE JET THE FOLLOWING MORNING IT WAS AS ONE AMERICAN COMEDIAN SAID LIKE BEING SPENT SPENDING THREE HOURS BEING TOLD TO EAT YOUR VEGETABLES RIHANNA
I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY OH SOME WALLABY ON SOME POINT I THINK IT WAS DISCUSSED VERY HEAVY HANDED BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT SOME SMITH ACTUALLY SAID HE WASN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE AND EVEN IF THAT WASN'T SURE IF HE WASN'T THE FIRST ACT IS THE WANT TO DEDICATE IT I THINK HE WAS DOING A LOT TO PROVE THAT HE DID CARE ABOUT THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY AND
I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP AND A BIT OVER ZEALOUS I THINK ACTUALLY IF PEOPLE LIKE LEE NORWICH CAP HYPOCRITICAL THOUGH HE MIGHT BE BY GETTING ON HIS PRIVATE JET AS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU HE PROBABLY DID WHO CARES ACTUALLY HE IS USING HIS PLATFORM AND HIS VOICE TO SAY SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT AND TO SPEAK TO SO MANY MORE PEOPLE ABOUT AN ISSUE WHICH HE ACTUALLY DOES CARE QUITE DEEPLY ABOUT AND WELL GOES TO AND THAT'S THAT BOY HAS DEEPLY ABOUT HIS AFFAIR POINT ISN'T IT TOBY I MEAN IF THEY'RE UP THERE SAYING
YOU KNOW LET'S BEAT UP OLD LADIES IN THE STREET OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD LIKE THAT AND WHOOSH THEY SAY LET'S ALL BE NICE TO EACH OTHER WEALTH I THINK WE MAY BE BORING BUT THE PROBLEM ISN'T THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT HOLLYWOOD STARS AND FILM MAKERS CHOOSE TO ADVOCATE ON THE TICK ON BEHALF OF PARTICULAR CAUSES
IT'S JUST THE CAUSES THEY ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE KIND OF LIBERAL LEFT NATURE AND IT QUITE NICE ABOUT THEN WELL IT CREATES THE IMPRESSION THAT HOLLYWOOD IS THIS TINY CABAL OF LORDS ALL OF WHOM FEEL EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AND THINK EXACTLY THE SAME THING AND I THINK THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GRIEVANCE NARRATIVE THAT HAS FUELLED THE RISE OF THE GHASTLY DONALD TRUMP THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SAVE THE WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT THEM TO DO
I WANT THEM TO MAKE FILMS WHICH DON'T REPRESENT PARTICULAR VICTIM GROUPS OR I ON BEHALF OF PARTICULAR NOW THAT'D BREAK THAT UNIVERSAL THEMES WHICH UNIVERSE OF EVIDENCE LIKE THAT SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE AND THAT ARE RIGHT AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER RHIANA ISN'T IT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SORT OF OSCARS COME ROUND ONCE A YEAR DOESN'T REALLY MATTER A FEW HOURS SO WATCH THE FILMS DO THAT YES I MEAN THE OSCARS ARE JUST A MOUTHPIECE FOR HOLLYWOOD THEY DON'T
REPRESENT EXACTLY WHAT HOLLYWOOD'S WHAT IS TOBY RIGHT WHEN THE FILMS THEMSELVES DEMO YES MY GOD WE NEED TO GET RIGHT TO THE CRUX OF THIS ISSUE THAT IS ABOUT GIVING OUT A GOLD STATUETTE IT'S ABOUT SCREENWRITERS AND CASTING AGENTS MAKING FILMS THAT ARE WAY MORE DIVERSE NOT ONLY WITH COLOUR BUT I HATE TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY WITH WOMEN BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO USE MY VERSATILE EXACTLY THE WEIGHT THE WEIGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING IS NOT TRYING TO
INCLUDE TEN PER CENT OF THE CAST AFRICAN AMERICANS X. PER CENT WOMEN SOME PER CENT ASIAN AND SO FORTH NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE AN APPEAL IN THAT WAY BUT APPEALED BY TRANSCENDING THE NARROW ARBITRARY FACTS OF IDENTITY POLITICS AND STRIKING UNIVERSAL THEME BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET EVERYONE REGARDLESS LABOUR BUT THEY ON THAT LOVELY IT'S A LOVELY IDEA BUT I THINK OVERALL WE DO NEED TO START REPRESENTING THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE SOON AS WE DO
PROPERLY THEN THESE ARGUMENTS WILL HAVE HAD SOME EFFECT AND THEN HOPEFULLY LATER THAT WELL THAT YOU'RE ENVISIONING BUT RELATIVE YOU THINK THERE IS A SORT OF CONTRAST CONSPIRACIES ARE TWO BIGGER WOOD BUT IS THERE SOMETHING DO THEY ALL GET TOGETHER AND SAY YOU KNOW WE ALL FEEL THE SAME SO LET'S PUNCH THAT MESSAGE ACROSS
I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE JADA PINKETT SMITH KIND OF HAVING A LITTLE GREEK POSSIBLY I THINK SHE I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT CHRIS ROCK KIND OF PICKED UP ON HOW YOU COMPERE AT THE MILK OUT AND WILL SMITH AND YOU THINK THAT THEY WERE BOTH COMING AT IT FROM A SIMILAR ANGLE ALTHOUGH CHRIS ROCK CHOSE TO VOICED IT IN ONE WAY AND SHE CHOSE THAT VOICE IN A COMPLETELY DIF TEN SECONDS TOBY FOR YOUR PERFECT FILM THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT HOLLYWOOD SUFFER FROM A LIBERAL BIAS
ONE OF THE FILMS UP FOR NOMINATION THIS YEAR WAS TRUMBO ABOUT MCCARTHYISM THE MCCARTHYISM THESE DAYS IS THE OTHER WAY IT'S LIBERAL MCCARTHYISM AND THE ONE PERSON TO SPEAK OUT ON BEHALF OF HOLLYWOOD AND DEFEND THE CAST IS CHARLOTTE RAMPLING GOT IT BEEN BLANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED TOBY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING
