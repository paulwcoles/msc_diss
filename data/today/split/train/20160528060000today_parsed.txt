IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MAY GOOD MORNING THIS IS TODAY WITH JUSTIN WEBB AND JOHN HUMPHRYS THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING MEDICAL EXPERT SCIENTISTS AND ACADEMICS ARE CALLING FOR THE RIO OLYMPICS TO BE POSTPONED OR MOVED BECAUSE OF THE OUTBREAK OF ZEKE A VIRUS IN BRAZIL
A REPORT SAYS THAT HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WITH LIFE THREATENING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE BEING REFUSED SPECIALIST CARE IN ENGLAND AND LATER IN THE PROGRAMME IT'S ONE HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THE MOST DEADLY NAVAL ENGAGEMENT OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR WILL BE SPEAKING TO THE GRANDSON OF ADMIRAL SIR JOHN JELLICOE WHO COMMANDED THE BRITISH FLEET ALSO THE AUTHOR DAVID MITCHELL ON HIS NEW NOVEL SLADE HOUSE AND THE CREATING OF MAGICAL WORLDS FROM CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
WE TEND TO EAT A LOT OF FANTASY WHEN WE WERE KIDS NARNIA AT THE SECRET GARDEN AND THEY HAVE DOORS IN THERE
IF THERE IS A BOOK WHICH STARTS IN OUR WORLD BUT CONTAINS A FANTASY WORLD THERE HAS TO BE SOME MEANS OF GETTING TO IT AND YOU CAN'T AVOID THE DOOR TODAY'S NEWS OR IN A CORACLE
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED LEADING SCIENTISTS ARE CALLING FOR THE RIO OLYMPICS TO BE MOVED UP A SPOON TO BECAUSE OF THE RISKS POSED BY THE SEEKER VIRUS THEY THEY'VE WRITTEN AN OPEN LETTER TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SAYING THERE'S A DANGER TO THE MOSQUITO BORNE DISEASE WHICH HAS BEEN LINKED TO BIRTH DEFECTS THAT IT WILL SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD THE GROUP POINTS OUT THAT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS INCLUDING THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHICH IS MOVED FROM CHINA BECAUSE AT THE SARS OUTBREAK OF A MILLION VISITORS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE GAMES IN AUGUST ANTI MORE REPORTS
ONE OF THE SIGNATORIES TO THE LETTER SAYS HOLDING THE GAMES IN RIO COULD LEAD TO AN OLYMPICS OF BRAIN DAMAGE AS INFECTED VISITORS RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRIES THE SCIENTISTS SAY THEY ARE ESPECIALLY WORRIED THAT THE VIRUS COULD BE CARRIED TO COUNTRIES WITH LOW INCOMES IN SOUTH ASIA AND AFRICA THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AFFECTED YET THE AUTHORITIES IN RIO SO THEY ARE TAKING ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE MOSQUITO THE TRANSMITS THE VIRUS
THE W.H.O. SAID SEEKER WAS ALREADY CIRCULATING IN MORE THAN SIXTY COUNTRIES THERE WAS NO PUBLIC HEALTH JUSTIFICATION FOR POSTPONING ON MOVING THE GAMES THE SCIENTISTS ALSO ALLEGE WHAT THEY CALL AN OVERLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE W.H.O. AND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE
THEY CLAIMED THAT HAS LED TO OFFICIALS' PRE JUDGING THE LEVEL OF RISK AND IN EFFECT GIVING THE OLYMPICS A GREEN LIGHT EVEN BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS ASSESSED THEY ARE SUGGESTING A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP MIGHT BE NEEDED TO RESTORE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE W.H.O.
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF CHILDREN REFERRED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND LAST YEAR INCLUDING SOME WHO'D ATTEMPTED SUICIDE TO RECEIVE NO HELP ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT FROM THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER THE REVIEW FOUND HUGE VARIATIONS IN CARE WITH SOME CHILDREN HAVING TO WAIT MONTHS FOR AN APPOINTMENT HE'S A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BUCHAN
THE SUPPORTERS THE LATEST DAMNING INDICTMENT OF A SYSTEM THAT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY PATIENTS' APPEARANCE PSYCHIATRIST TO BE FEELING TOO MANY CHILDREN FIGURES COLLATED BY THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER FOR ENGLAND PHONE THE TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE REFERRED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE DENIED ANY TREATMENT IN ONE AREA SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT THE REFERRALS WED AND DEEMED TO BE ILL ENOUGH TO RECEIVE SUPPORT
BUT IF YOU ALSO FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WITH LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS INCLUDING SERIOUS SELF HARM WHAT HAVING ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WERE DENIED ANY SPECIALIST CARE WAITING TIMES ALSO VEERED WILDLY FROM FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE NORTH WEST TO TWO HUNDRED BASE IN THE WEST MIDLANDS MINISTERS SAY THEY INTEND TO INTRODUCE WAITING TIME STANDARDS FOR ALL CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS
TONY BLAIR HAS ACCUSED THE CURRENT LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE ANY SERIOUS ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMICAL FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY IN AN INTERVIEW TO BE BROADCAST ON THIS WEEK'S WORLD ON B. B. C. TWO THIS AFTERNOON MY BLAIR SUGGESTED THAT MISTER CORBIN SELECTION AS PRIME MINISTER IT WOULD BE A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT HE ALSO INSISTED THAT THERE WAS SENT THE CENTRE GROUND NEEDED TO REGAIN THE POLITICAL INITIATIVE
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE CENTRE AND I IN WHEN I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I DO THINK BY THE WAY IT WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT FOR A MAJOR WESTERN COUNTRY TO GET GRIPPED BY THIS TYPE OF POPULIST POLICY MAKING LEFT OR RIGHT
THE COURSE IN ARGENTINA HER SENTENCE THE COUNTRY'S FORMER MILITARY LEADER NOW IN UNIT TO TWENTY YEARS IN JAIL FOR HIS PART IN A MURDEROUS CONSPIRACY BETWEEN SIX SOUTH AMERICAN DICTATORSHIPS DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FOURTEEN OTHER FORMER OFFICERS ALSO SENTENCED FOR THEIR PART IN THE SECRET DEAL MONA'S OPERATION CONDOR AS A RESULT OF THE CONSPIRACY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED LEFT WING ACTIVISTS WERE ABDUCTED TORTURED AND IN SOME CASES KILLED
BINION HEIRS ALREADY SERVING PRISON SENTENCES FOR OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PABLO VIGNETTE WAS THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN THE TRIAL
AND IT WAS THIS TRIAL IS DIFFERENT TO OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE'S ATTENTION CENTRE OR IN ONE LOCATION IN ARGENTINA WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN ARGENTINA URUGUAY AND CHILE BOLIVIA PARAGUAY AND BRAZIL
OFFICIALS IN WESTERN CANADA HAVE CONFIRMED THAT REMAINS FOUND IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGE NORTH OF BANK OVER A BASE OF A BRITISH TOURIST WHO HADN'T BEEN SEEN FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS TOM BILLINGS HE WAS TWENTY TWO AND FROM OXFORD WAS LAST SEEN HIKING IN NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRTEEN HIS REMAINS WERE FOUND LAST MONTH THE AUTHORITIES DON'T BELIEVE HIS DEATH WAS SUSPICIOUS
EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORS HAD GIVEN THE DRUGS COMPANY GLAXOSMITHKLINE PERMISSION TO MARKET A GENE THERAPY FOR A RARE IMMUNE DISORDER THE ONUS AFFECTS ONLY TWO DOESN'T B.B.C. WORLDWIDE WHO HAVE TO LIVE IN GERM FREE ENVIRONMENTS BUT CHEERS IS THE FIRST LARGE MULTINATIONAL DRUG COMPANY TO BE GIVEN APPROVAL FOR A GENE THERAPY AND IT'S HOPED THE DECISION WOULD BE TO OTHER TREATMENTS FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CONDITIONS HE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT PAD GAUCHE
HUNDREDS OF INHERITED DISORDERS SUCH AS CYSTIC FIBROSIS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND MANY TYPES OF BLINDNESS ARE CAUSED BY FAULTY GENES
THE AIM OF THE GENE THERAPY IS TO CURE THE DISEASE BY INTRODUCING HEALTHY COPIES OF THE GENE INTO THE PATIENT THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF THE TREATMENT IS THAT IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE GIVEN ONCE AND POTENTIALLY IT OFFERS A PERMANENT CURE
THE IDEA FIRST EMERGED WITH MUCH HYPE OR THIRTY YEARS AGO AT THE TIME IT'S ADVOCATE SAID IT WOULD CURE EVERYTHING FOR TWENTY YEARS IT IT CURED NOTHING
THE PRACTICALITIES OF INTRODUCING THE RIGHT GENE INTO THE RIGHT CELLS PROVED MORE DIFFICULT THAN FIRST THOUGHT BUT IN RECENT YEARS EARLY DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN OVERCOME AND REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO GIVE THE GO AHEAD TO BORE GENE THERAPIES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
THEN AMERICAN VINTAGE CLAIMED IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR HAS CRASHED INTO THE HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK WHILE CELEBRATING HIS TWENTY SEVENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY THE P. FORTY SEVEN THUNDERBOLT WENT DOWN NEAR THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE POLICE SEARCHING FOR THE PILOT TO HAVE RECOVERED A BODY
ONE PERSON HAS BEEN TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AFTER AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN A GAS MAINS ON AN INDUSTRIAL ESTATE IN KENT FIRE A CRUSADE THE PLACE AT THE ESTUARY BUSINESS PARK IN WHITSTABLE IS NOW UNDER CONTROL IMAGES POST IT ON THE INTERNET SHOWED HUGE FLAMES ONE WITNESS WHO LIVES A MILE AWAY DESCRIBING HOW THE SKY LIT UP AFTER THE EXPLOSION THE CAUSE OF THE BLAST ISN'T KNOWN
A REVOLUTIONARY TYPE OF FOOD DELIVERY LORRY TAKES TO THE STREETS TODAY ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER SUPERMARKET LORRY IT'S NOT COOLED IN THE NORMAL WAY WITH THE USE OF DIESEL BY LIQUID NITROGEN STORED IN TANKS AT MINUS TWO HUNDRED CELSIUS SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE TRIBE TO BUY NEW CLEAN WAYS OF KEEPING THINGS COLD COULD EVENTUALLY BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS A YEAR OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HARROP IN REPORTS
ON A WARMING PLANET DEMAND FOR COOLING IS INCREASING BUT IF WE OBTAIN THAT COOLING FROM ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY FOSSIL FUELS THAT'LL MAKE WARMING WORSE SO THE WORLD NEEDS CLEAN COOL TECHNOLOGIES THE LIQUID NITROGEN TRUCK HE'S ONE
THE CHILLER SECTION OF THE TRACK IS CALLED WITH BRUTALLY COLD LIQUID NITROGEN LEFT OVER FROM THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN LIQUID OXYGEN
IN A SECOND INNOVATION THAT NITROGEN IS THEN USED TO DRIVE A RADICALLY NEW TYPE OF ENGINE AS IT EXPANDS SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES WHILST TURNING FROM A LIQUID TO A GAS HALL WITH ZERO POLLUTION
EXPERTS SAY CLEAN CALLING COULD BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS A YEAR GLOBALLY IN A FEW DECADES BUT THEY SAY POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO MAXIMISE THE POTENTIAL OF THE COLD ECONOMY
THOUSANDS OF WORDS USED OR CREATED BY A ROAD DARLA BEING BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A NEW DICTIONARY AS PART OF CELEBRATIONS TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE BRIGHTEST BIRTH IT'S TAKEN FIVE YEARS TO COMPILE AN CONTAINS ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND WORDS BOTH REAL AND INVENTED SOME OF WHICH INCLUDING GUMP A WINK AND CROP OLD HAVE NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED BEFORE
AND TIME IS NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN MEDICAL EXPERTS SOME MEDICAL EXPERTS ARE SAYING THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN BRAZIL SHOULD BE CALLED OFF OR MOVE BECAUSE OF THE ZEKE A VIRUS THEY WRITTEN A LETTER ABOUT IT TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ONE OF THOSE SIGNATORIES IS PROFESSOR EDWIN VAN TURNING
OF THE CENTRE FOR MIDWIFERY PERFORMANCE UNIVERSITY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHY
INDEED IN A MAINLY INSTANCE IT'S BECAUSE OF ITS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM FOR POTENTIALLY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BRAZIL AS A POOR COUNTRY AND IT'S
THE RISK OF SPREADING THE DISEASE TO OTHER POOR COUNTRIES WHERE MALARIA IS ENDEMIC COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH ASIA AND WE HAD BOURNEMOUTH UNIVERSITY WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN THERE PAUL AND NEPAL IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE INTO SALADS MALARIA IS ENDEMIC AND IS THE RISK OF SPREADING DEAD MITES ACCELERATED SCALE SO YOU'RE AFRAID THAT SUPPORTERS
AS WOULD WOULD GO TO BRAZIL OR INDEED THE ATHLETES THEMSELVES AND TAKE THE VIRUS BACK HOME WITH THEM YES THAT'S THE MAIN CONSIDERATION
BUT IS IT THAT VIRULENT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BITTEN BY A MOSQUITO DON'T YOU THAT'S THE FIRST THING YES IF THIS SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED BUT THE GREATEST RISK BEING BITTEN BY A MOSQUITO AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AT THE IF IDENTIFIED IN THE LETTER IS THAT
THE CONTROL OF THE FIRE RISK OF OF THE MOSQUITOES IS NOT VERY WELL DONE IN BRAZIL AT THE MOMENT AND DEEP
THE MOSQUITOES ARE SPREADING INCIDENT IS RAISING
THERE ARE SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS IN COPING WITH IT AND DID THE SPRAT IN BRAZIL AND THE ADVICE FROM THE W.H.O. WHICH CAME OUT YESTERDAY THAT THERE ARE UPDATES THEY START THEY STOPPED COUNTING IN BRAZIL LISTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COPE BUT THEY DIDN'T DISMISS YORK OR DIDN'T THEY THEY DID SAY THAT THE GAME SHOULDN'T BE MOVED OR COUNCIL YES AND ONE OF THE FUN OF THAT DON'T WORRY WE HAVE AS A ZOO AS A GROUP IS THAT MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
TO CLOSER LINK BETWEEN DE I.O.C. ENDED W.H.O. THEY'VE SENT THEY SIGNED UP AS OFFICIAL PARTNERS AND THEY
A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT AND ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE LETTER IS A CALL TO HAVE INDEPENDENT EXPERTS LOOKING AT THE DATA AVAILABLE MOVING TO BE NOT
SAYING WE WANT TO POSTPONE THE GAMES FOR HER BUT FOR REASONS OF FUN IT'S A IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM
IN WHICH CASE THAT THAT THAT THAT THE CHARGE YOU MAKE AGAINST THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION AND THE I.O.C. AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS QUITE A SERIOUS ONE YES AND WE DON'T MAKE THAT LIGHTLY AND THAT IS A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVEN'T MADE PUBLIC BOTH THE W.H.O. AND THE I.O.C. ARE NOT DEMOCRATIC GLE ELECTED ORGANISATIONS THEY ARE
SUPER GOVERNMENT KIND OF LEVEL AND THE ART YOU SEE IS THERE A SIMILAR KIND OF ORGANISATION AS WE ALL ENJOYING SPORT FOOTBALL BUT THEY ARE NOT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED ORGANISATIONS AND WHEN YOU SAY THERE'S A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT HAS NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC
WHAT DID MY MOTHER THAT A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE I.O.C. AND THE DOUBLE THE W.H.O. YOU SHOULD BE WORKING FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE POPULATION AND THEY SHOULDN'T
BUT ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE EYE OH SEE I CAN SEE WHY THEY CAN'T MAKE THAT PUBLIC AND SAY IT IS ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF PUBLICITY OR IT'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ADVERTISING OR THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE TO IT AND WE JUST SIMPLY SAYING IT'S MAYBE TOO CLOSE
FOR COMFORT RIGHT BUT JUST QUICK FINAL THOUGHT YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT IT UM NO I DON'T THINK THEY'LL CHANGE THEIR MIND ON CHANGING THE GAMES BUT I HOPE THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR MINDS AND HAVING AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE AND DO THAT SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS FIRST OF UNTIDY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED
TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN AS A WARNING TODAY THAT CHILDREN SUFFERING GENUINELY HARMFUL MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE BEING TURNED AWAY FROM TREATMENT WITH A SUGGESTION BEING MADE THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY ILL ENOUGH AND LONGFIELD IS THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER IT'S HER REPORT THAT I'M REFERRING TO YOUR SOFA THE STUDIO GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THING THAT'S GOING WRONG
WELL AS CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER BRING IT'S MY JOB TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE AREAS OF CHILDREN'S LIVES WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED AND OVER THE LAST YEAR I'VE HAD A CONSTANT STREAM OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS ANNA DE PROFESSIONALS WHO COME TO SEE ME TO TELL ME ABOUT
THEIR INABILITY TO GET HELP WHEN THEY REALLY NEED TO DO IT WE'VE GOT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS AROUND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WHO MAY BE SUICIDAL THEY MAY HAVE PSYCHOSIS WHO GO TO THEIR G.P. AND THEN THEY ARE TURNED AWAY WHEN THEY GET THEIR SPECIALIST HELP
FOR THOSE THAT'S A TERRIBLE POSITION AND THEY'RE REALLY LOST WE'VE NOWHERE TO GO BUT TURNED AWAY WITH WITH WHAT EXCUSE FOR THEM BEING TURNED AWAY WELL I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE IS THERE'S A GAP EMERGING BETWEEN THE HELP AND SUPPORT THAT G.P.S CAN OFFER
THE SPECIALIST SERVICES TO SO G. PEACE MAY DEEM THAT ACTUALLY THEY CAN'T HELP THEIR CHILDREN THEY NEED SPECIALIST HELP AT THE SPECIAL THEY THEY THERE'S SPECIALLY SERVICES THEMSELVES ARE SAYING THAT THEY AREN'T SERIOUS ENOUGH NOW THE ANSWER TO THAT IS I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW YET QUITE WHY THEY'VE BEEN TURNED AWAY BUT CERTAINLY BEEN TURNED AWAY OR INDEED BEEN PUT ON A WAITING LIST FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS IS CLEARLY PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH THEIR HOUSE SEE WHAT
N.H.S. SAY N. H. S. ENGLAND IS THAT THE DATA IN YOUR REPORT ABOUT PEOPLE BEING TURNED AWAY WHEN THEY ARE REALLY SERIOUSLY ILL AND IN NEED OF HELP ACTUALLY ISN'T SUBSTANTIATE SUBSTANTIATED BY THE CONCLUSIONS YOU DRAW IN OTHER WORDS THEY SAY MEG THE EXAMPLE WILL BE GIVEN AT SOMEONE IT GOES PERHAPS TO A. AND E. WHO IS REALLY SERIOUSLY
DISTURBED BUT ACTUALLY THE PARENTS TURN UP THEY DECIDE TO TAKE IT THROUGH THE SCHOOL OR NOT GO ANY FURTHER BUT ARE YOU REALLY CONVINCED THAT YOU HAVE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO ARE DESPERATE AND THEIR FAMILIES DESPERATE FOR TREATMENT AND AREN'T GETTING IT
I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THIS IS DATED IT'S COME DIRECTLY FROM LOCAL TRUST THEMSELVES AT BEST IT SHOWS A WAITING LIST OF SIX MONTHS FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE SERIOUSLY ILL
THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THAT THOSE WHO DO GET APPOINTMENTS ACTUALLY THE TRUST SAID THAT A THIRD OF THEM WILL THEN GO ON TO ACTUALLY STRIKE CHILDREN OFF IF THEY MISSED THOSE APPOINTMENTS NOW WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN IN THE BEST OF TIMES THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO TO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS WITHOUT A LOT OF HELP AND IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION
IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT I THINK WHICH I'VE DONE THIS REPORT TO DROP COMMISSIONERS' ATTENTION TO IT LOCALLY I WANT THEM TO LOOK AT THE WEAKNESSES IN THEIR SYSTEM AND LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE PROVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN GET THEIR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THEY NEED HOW THEY JUST OVERWHELMED I MEAN IS IT AS SIMPLE AS THAT THEY'VE GOT THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH OF A CASE THAT WHEN YOU GIVE THAT EXAMPLE OF OF STRIKING OFF CHILDREN WHO DON'T TURN UP FOR APPOINTMENTS POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY THINK WILL ONLY DEAL WITH THE ONES THAT WE BUT ACTUALLY DO TURN UP WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO CHASE ME
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AND CERTAINLY THAT SOMETHING I'LL BE WANTS TO US THE TRUST THEMSELVES TRUST WILL TELL ME THAT ACTUALLY THEY DO HAVE TOO MUCH DEMAND WE KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE AWARENESS THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD TO GET HELP BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING AT THE LOCAL SYSTEMS IT'S ABOUT RECOGNISING THE
TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THAT CHILDREN ARE IN AND THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HELP AND LOOKING AT HOW THEIR LOCAL SYSTEMS CAN RESPOND TO THAT CLEARLY IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS
A LONG HILL CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER FOR ENGLAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS TEN PAST EIGHT TWELVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND THE MOST IMPORTANT AND DEADLIEST NAVAL ENGAGEMENT OF WORLD WAR ONE EVENTS WILL BE HELD TODAY TO COMMEMORATE THE DEATHS OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND BRITISH AND TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND GERMAN SAILORS AND SOLDIERS ONE OF THEM WAS THE SON OF RUDYARD KIPLING HERE'S PART OF A POEM HE WROTE TO HONOUR HIM MY BOY JACK
HAVE YOU NEWS OF MY BOY JACK NOT TO THIS TIDE WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT HE'LL COME BACK NOT WITH THIS WIND BLOWING AND THIS TIDE HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD WORD OF HIM
NOT THIS TIDE FOR WHAT HE'S SUNK WILL HARDLY SWIM NOT WITH THIS WIND BLOWING AND THIS TIDE
OH DEAR WHAT COMFORT CAN I FIND NONE THIS TIDE NOR ANY TIDE EXCEPT HE DID NOT SHANE HE'S KIND NOT EVEN WITH THAT WIND BLOWING AND THAT TIDE
THEN HOLD YOUR HEAD UP ALL THE MORE THIS TIDE AND EVERY TIDE BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON KNEW BOHR AND GAVE TO THAT WIND BLOWING AND HAVE THAT TIE
ZEB'S FILMS READING MY BOY JACK WE'RE JOINED ON THE LINE BY MICK JELLICOE WHO IS THE GRANDSON OF ADMIRAL SIR JOHN JELLICOE WAS THE COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH GRAND FLEET AT THAT BATTLE THERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
GOOD MORNING TELL YOU AND I KNOW YOU WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THIS ON JUTLAND THE UNFINISHED BATTLE AND UNFINISHED IN THE SENSE PERHAPS THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS A BIT OF A SCAPEGOAT WASN'T HE THE BRITISH HAD EXPECTED WE HAD EXPECTED ANOTHER GREAT SORT OF TRAFALGAR TYPE TRIUMPH AND IT WASN'T LIKE THAT
NO IT WASN'T I MEAN I I CALLED AT THE UNFINISHED BATTLE REALLY BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH AND YOU ARE STILL GOING THROUGH A SORT OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT THIS BATTLE IT HASN'T BEEN SO MUCH CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE BRITISH AND THE GERMANS BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSY OR MORE OF A VITRIOLIC CONTROVERSY WITHIN THE BRITISH NAVY BECAUSE WELL BECAUSE
AS AS YOU SAID RIGHT AT THE START HE WAS SELECTED AS A SCAPEGOAT IT WAS EASIER TO SELECT THEIR PERSONALITY I THINK UM TO LOOK TO THE TRAITS OF PERSONALITY WHETHER ONE PERSON WAS MORE NOW SONIC OR CHARISMATIC
MY GRANDFATHER WAS ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL MAN VERY CEREBRAL ARE VERY KIND BUT A GREAT STRATEGIST A GREAT THINKER WHO ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMAND PERSONALITIES ON THE DAY IN GERMANY I THINK WE'VE COME TO THAT WE'VE COME TO THE POINT WHERE WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS THIS BATTLE ITSELF
A TACTICALLY WAS UNDECIDED AND I SAY TACTICALLY UNDERLIE MAD BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN THERE IN WITH THE BENEFIT OF TIME
THEN YOU SEE THE STRATEGIC IMPACT OF THE OUTCOME I THINK THE TENANCY IS VERY OFTEN TO LOOK AT BATTLES WITHIN THEIR IMMEDIATE WITHIN THE IMMEDIACY AND THAT GIVES ONE A
ARE REALLY A FALSE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE YOU IF YOU DO THAT YOU COUNT I SUPPOSE YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF SHELLS THAT LANDED IN THE NUMBER OF SHIPS THAT WERE SUNK ON THE NUMBER OF LIVES THAT WERE LOST AND IT BECOMES AN ARITHMETICAL IT EXACTLY EXACTLY AND I THINK ONE HAS TO ACTUALLY GO BACK TO WHAT THE OBJECTIVES OF EACH FLEET FOR EACH NATION REALLY WERE
NOT JUST ON THE DAY BUT GENERALLY I MEAN THE BRITISH THE BRITISH LAID DOWN A BLOCKADE AN ECONOMIC BLOCKADE OF GERMANY AND WAS SLOWLY STRANGLING THE GERMAN ECONOMY IN THIS WAS REALLY FELT NOT ONLY ON THE FRONT LINE BUT IT WAS DEEPLY FELT BY THE CIVILIAN POPULATION TO GERMANY THE WINTER OF NINETEEN SIXTEEN WAS CALLED THE TURNIP WINTER IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME IN SOME WAYS NOW ONE WOULD CALL THIS TYPE OF WARFARE ALMOST A WAR CRY
BUT THIS IS A STARVING THERE WOULD BE THAT IT WAS NOT FELT GOOD AS THEY WERE STARVING BUT THIS IS THE WAY THE BRITISH HAD HEARD PLAN THEIR STRATEGY SO MY GRANDFATHER'S ROLE WAS READY TO MAINTAIN THE MARITIME SUPREMACY OF BRITAIN
SO THAT THIS BLOCKADE COULD CONTINUE ON THE LAND WAR WE HAD ENTERED A PERIOD WERE WE ENTERED MANY PERIODS AND SHRILL STALEMATE NEITHER THE LAND WAR NO THE NAVAL WAR
WHO WAS GOING TO PRODUCE A SORT OF A VICTORY IN AN AFTERNOON AND PARTICULARLY JUTLAND JUTLAND THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND ONLY STARTED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON ON THE NORTH SEA THREE FORTY EIGHT THE FIRST FERRARI WAS WITH US OPENED AND IT VERY SOON BECAME A MURKY
VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO ACTUALLY COMMANDER FLEET TERRIBLE NORTH SEA FOG MIXED IN WITH CHEMICAL SMOKE SCREENS
MIXED IN WITH SORT OF LINGERING BROWN CALLED CLOUDS AT ANY ONE POINT YOU MIGHT BE LUCKY TO SEE A COUPLE OF SHIPS THIS IS AFTER SORT OF FIVE THIRTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THOUGH IT WAS CLEARER
WHAT A HELLISH BATTLE IT MUST HAVE BEEN I THINK SO I THINK YOU KNOW A TERRIFYING BATTLE TAUGHT FOR MANY PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ON A SHIP ARE BELOW DECKS AND THEY JUST HAVE TO GUESS WHAT'S GOING ON OR ABOVE DECK THEN OUTSIDE AND YOU JUST FEEL IT THROUGH VIBRATIONS AND THOSE RUMOURS GOING FROM ONE END OF THE SHIP TO THE OTHER
JELLICOE THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HIT TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS THE RESIDENTS OF THE IRAQI CITY OF FALLUJAH JUST THIRTY MILES FROM BAGHDAD THEY LIVING UNDER THE AWFUL CONDITIONS IMPOSED ON THEM BY SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE IRAQI ARMY DURING THAT TIME HAS BEEN ON THE RETREAT TO PUT IT MILDLY RUNNING AWAY FROM CONFLICT WITH THE TERROR GROUP RATHER THAN CONFRONTING IT NOW THOUGH THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS CLAIMING
MISSY RYAN OF THE WASHINGTON POST HAS BEEN WATCHING THE START OF THE BATTLE TO RETAKE THE CITY OF FALLUJAH TO HOW READY THE IRAQI ARMY SEEMS TO BE
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THEY'RE SHOWING UP IN FORCE AROUND FOR WHICH THERE'S NOT ONLY THE GAZE OF THE IRAQI ARMY THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FLAVOURS AND FEDERAL POLICE THERE ARE SOON YOU TRIBAL FIGHTERS TO THE SOUTH WEST
AND THEN THERE'S A HALL SLEW OF SHE ATE MY CHAISE AND SHOW THEY ARE WELL ARMED AND THEY'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD WORK IN TERMS OF CLEARING SOME OF THE VILLAGES AND TOWNS AROUND BEAUTIFUL RICHER BUT REALLY THE HARDEST WORK AND THE FIERCEST ACTION POTENTIAL IS STILL THERE WHEN THEY DECIDE ACTUALLY PRESS INTO THE CITY IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A TEST DAD
REBUILT IRAQI SECURITY FORCES I THINK IT'S PRETTY ENCOURAGING SO FAR BUT WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY GET INTO THE URBAN AND RUN UP AGAINST THE ISIS DEFENCES INSIDE OF FALLUJAH ITSELF WHAT'S CHANGED THE IRAQI ARMY WHAT WHY ARE THEY TOUGHER THIS TIME DO YOU THINK
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE SOME BETTER EQUIPMENT THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BETTER COMMUNICATION DEVICES BECAUSE OF THE HELP FROM THE COALITION AND THEY'RE IN BETTER TOUCH WITH U.S. AND OTHER COALITION AIRCRAFT
THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OUTSIDE NATIONS SIR BEN WORKING ON WITH THE IRAQIS AS HOP IN THE CAR WHEN MORE ACCURATE AIR STRIKES THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THEY'RE BETTER ABLE THE TARGET
THE ACERS POSITIONS WITHIN THE CITY I THINK IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS THEY'RE CERTAINLY BETTER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST IN THE AIR THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL BE A BORE SWIFT ACCURATE AND WEST DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION
WE'VE SEEN IN PLACES LIKE WERE MUDDY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHEN WE WERE OUT NEAR THE FRONT LINE THEY ALWAYS CONSTANT ARTILLERY FIRE ON THE PART OF THE FEDERAL POLICE AND THE SHIA MILITIA
AND THERE WERE MANY REPORTS FROM OFFICIALS FROM FOR LOU'S RESONANCE ABSOLUTION AT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WITHIN THE CITY NOW WHILE THEY'RE GOVERNMENT DENIES IT THAT'S BEEN THE CASE THERE CERTAINLY ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF SOME OF THE ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THOSE IRAQI GOVERNMENT AROUND FORCES
AND WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT CONDITIONS IN FALLUJAH FOR THE CIVILIANS WHO ARE THEIR CONDITIONS ARE DIRE WITHIN THAT THERE'S BEEN A SIEGE AND ISIS HAS BEEN IN CONTROL WHAT'S ALL THAT FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOW AND IN RECENT MONTHS IT'S GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THERE'S STORY OF A THEORY TROUBADOUR MADDER SARAN WHERE THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED AND DISTRIBUTED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE
AND THERE ARE REPORTS OF PEOPLE DYING FROM HUNGER RESORTED TO EATING ANIMAL SERIALLY BE SO PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS HE'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE TRADED YESTERDAY THERE WERE A FEW REPORTS WOULD BE SEVERAL HUNDREDS THEY'RE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT BUT FOR THE MOST PART WHILE THE SECURITY FORCES HAD TRIED OPEN PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE CITY THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE OBVIOUSLY ISIS IS PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING MISSY RYAN OF THE WASHINGTON POST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US

FUN FUN THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD MAY THANKS FOR THE MOMENT AND TOADS HAVE GOT A LORRA HAMMER JUST LOOKING AT OUR TRAIL BUT ALSO MORE WIDELY AT AFRICAT THE EAST DO YOU THINK A SET OF POLICIES WHICH WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT AID AND WE ARE TOLD THAT ACTUALLY IF WE ASSIST COUNTRIES
THEN THAT WILL DO SOMETHING TO STEM THE FLOW IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT ISN'T IT IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND IN THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY THE MORE RESOURCES PEOPLE HAVE THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE ACTUALLY TO MOVE
THAT THAT PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS ARE RESTRICTED BY THEIR IN INABILITY TO PAY FOR THOSE MOVEMENTS AND SO IS SO THAT'S THE CASE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVING MY MONEY MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEM TO MOVE BUT IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT
FOR SURE IN SOME CASES THAT AID MONEY WILL HELP PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRIES AS WELL SO
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO ARGUE AGAINST PROVIDING AID TO COUNTRIES THAT DESPERATELY NEEDED BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING WITH YOUR HAT ON AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WAS THE SUN THAT POOR COLLIE THE ACADEMIC AT AT AT OXFORD SUGGESTED SOME YEARS AGO IN A VERY CONTROVERSIAL WASN'T THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU
GIVE MORE AID YOU DO ACTUALLY INCREASE POTENTIALLY THE FLOW OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE WEST COMING TO EUROPE YOU THINK HE IS RIGHT WELL
I THINK IT THERE THAT'S A PUB PROBLEMS WITH PROFESSOR COLLIER'S POSITION ON MIGRATION AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT JUST ON THAT AGAIN BUT I THINK THAT THAT PROVIDING AID IS STILL FILLS A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER PURPOSES BUT IT'S NOT USEFUL AS A TOOL FOR CONTROLLING MIGRATION NECESSARILY IT'S USEFUL FOR IN SOME COUNTRIES IN WAR TORN COUNTRIES FOR GETTING PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REFUGES FOR INSTANCE FROM KENYA NOW THINKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SOMALIA
ABSOLUTELY AID PLACED INSIDE SOMALIA WILL HELP THAT KIND OF RETURN MOVEMENT HAPPEN BUT FOR THOSE WHO MARRIES TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ASPIRING TO FIND JOBS FOR FURTHER STUDY GREATER OPPORTUNITY
I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW AN AID PACKAGE COULD COULD COULD SUBSTANTIALLY TURN THAT DYNAMIC AROUND MARY DO YOU AGREE
I DO YOU
WHY THEN DO THEY TAKE THESE RISKS AND WE HAVE JUST SEEN THIS WEEK THOSE AWFUL PICTURES OF THE BOATS AND PEOPLE FALLING OFF THEM AND MANY MANY PEOPLE DROWNING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT FACES THEM OR IS IT THAT THEY BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING THROUGH AND OF COURSE BEING RESCUED NOW BY A NAVY SHIP HAD A HIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE
IT IN EVERY PRAYER WHICH COULDN'T HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY FLAME AND IT IT WAS TOTALLY CLOSED COUNTRY PEOPLE EVEN POOR PEOPLE WHERE I AM NOW I'M IN THE CAR
MANY OF THEM BELIEVE REALLY WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE STATE THEY THINK THAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO GO AND JOIN IN EVEN THOUGH THAT RATHER UNREALISTIC THEY BELIEVED IT BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE IT BIG IT'S VERY GOOD YOU'RE RIGHT MARY HARPER OUT I'VE GOT TO STOP YOU THERE WE'VE RUN OUT OF TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE LINE FOR THEIR TRAINED UP TO LAURA HAMMOND AS WELL FROM EASTERN THAT'S STUDIES THANK YOU
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO IT LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND ACCORDING TO THE TELEGRAPH ON OFFICIAL REVIEW WAS EXPECTED TO FIND THAT PENSIONERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP DRIVING WITHOUT HAVING TO RENEW THEIR LICENCES UNTIL THEY'RE SEVENTY FIVE THE OLDER DRIVERS TASK FORCE WHICH WILL REPORT IN JULY WILL APPARENTLY RECOMMEND THAT MINISTERS RELAX THE MANDATORY RENEWAL AGE OF SEVENTY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HEALTHIER
AND LIVING LONGER THE CHAIRMAN OF THE TASKFORCE JON PLOUGHMAN HAS TOLD PEOPLE OLDER DRIVERS ARE GENERALLY SAFER THAN OTHERS AND GIVING UP DRIVING PUTS THEM AT RISK THEY LOSE THEIR SOCIAL CONTACTS THEY HAVE THE MORE LIKELY GET ISOLATED AND DEPRESSED AND PUT A BURDEN ON THE CARE SYSTEM THE TIMES THE GUARDIAN THE FINANCIAL TIMES WILL HAVE HER PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGES OF PRESIDENT OBAMA A BRACING EMBRACING A SURVIVOR OF THE HIROSHIMA BOMBING AS HE BECAME THE FIRST SERVING AMERICAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT THE CITY THE GUARDIAN CALLS IT A TOUCHING MOMENT
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES OF THE DRY AND ABSTRACT DELIBERATIONS OF THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT IN JAPAN HAVE BEEN ECLIPSED BY THE SYMBOLISM OF MY OBAMA'S VISIT TO THE CITY WHERE A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY AN AMERICAN BOMB IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THE EYE NEWSPAPER LEADS ON THE TREASURY SELECT COMMITTEES ACCUSATION THERE BOTH SIDES IN THE REFERENDUM DEBATE ARE USING MISLEADING FIGURES HAD ARE MAKING UNQUALIFIED CLAIMS IT'S ALL TOO MUCH FOR DELIA SMITH VENTS HER FRUSTRATION ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE GUARDIAN
WHAT SHE SEES AS AN UNSAVOURY MIXTURE OF VICIOUS RHETORIC AND PETTY SQUABBLES HE QUESTIONS WHY THE REFERENDUMS TAKEN PLACE AT ALL AND ARGUES THAT THE E.U. IS IN ESSENCE A GROUP OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER THE SUN ON THE DAILY EXPRESS SEAS ON THE MARKS MADE BY DAVID CAMERON TO REPORTERS AT THE G.SEVEN SUMMIT IN WHICH HE SAID BRITAIN WAS AN AMAZING COUNTRY WHICH WOULD FIND ITS WAY WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF THE E.U. REFERENDUM THE EXPRESS SAW IT AS A CODED ADMISSION
THAT IS SCAREMONGERING MAY HAVE GONE TOO FAR THE SUN SAYS MISTER CAMERON ALSO SUGGESTED IMMIGRATION WAS A PRICE WORTH PAYING FOR E.U. MEMBERSHIP TALKS OF GAFFES BY HER PRIME MINISTER BLUNDER PRESSURE
THE MATRIMONIAL PROBLEMS OF JOHNNY DEPP AND AMBER HEARD HER SPLASHED OVER THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SUN THE MIRROR OF THE STAR TIME FOR MOST OF THE PAPERS HAVE ALL FEATURE PICTURES OF MIZ HEARD WITH BRUISING AROUND HER LEFT EYE SHE ARRIVED AT COURT TO SEEK A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND AT SOME POINTS I DID IT ALL HAPPENED ON THE DAY THE FILM ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS WAS RELEASED IN WHICH JOHNNY DEPP PLAYS THE MAD HATTER HE CALLS HIM THE MAD HITTER
AND FINALLY BAGGED THE PROWESS OF PENSIONERS GUIDING MOTORISED TRANSPORT THE TIMES TELLS A SEVENTY NINE YEAR OLD NORWEGIAN HAS BEEN PRAISED FOR HIS COOLNESS TO SAFETY LANDING IS LIGHT AIRCRAFT AFTER A SERIOUS MALFUNCTION AUGUSTA HAD A FLYING INSTRUCTOR SAYS I HEARD A BANG AND THEN THE PROPELLER DROPPED OFF
IT'S QUITE SERIOUS AND HE GLIDED FOR A MILE AND A HALF IN FACT IN ABOUT ONE THOUSAND FEET THEN HE LANDED SMOOTH DOWN THE RUNWAY HE SAID AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SEEM MORE FLUSTERED ABOUT HIS PREDICAMENT THEM EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT IT'S SATURDAY MORNING THEREFORE IT IS MEET THE AUTHOR TIME AND THIS WEEK JIM DEMOBBED IN EACH OF THE WRITER DAVID MITCHELL TALK ABOUT STORY TELLING CHILDHOOD MEMORIES AND THE FUTURE OF THE MODERN NOVEL
DAVID MITCHELL IS A WRITER WITH A RESTLESS IMAGINATION LOVES PLAYING WITH TIME AND PERSPECTIVE AND MAGICAL THINGS HIS FIRST BIG SUCCESS YOU'LL REMEMBER WAS WITH CLOUD ATLAS
AND HIS NEW NOVEL SLADE HOUSE BRINGS ALL THOSE FEELINGS TOGETHER WHEN WE SAT DOWN I ASKED THEM ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF READINGS THAT HE'D KNOWN FROM CHILDHOOD
I SENSE THAT THERE A CHILDHOOD MEMORY IS EMBEDDED IN THIS BOOK DAVID MITCHELL YOU GO THROUGH THE IRON DOOR OR GATE INTO SLADE WHO WERE TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN
AND THAT'S A MEMORY THAT WE ALL CARRY WITH US FROM CHILDHOOD READING ISN'T IT YES WE TEND TO EAT A LOT OF FANTASY WHEN WE WERE KIDS WE GET GIVEN FANTASY BOOKS NARNIA WITH THE SECRET GARDEN AND THEY HAVE DOORS IN THERE
IF THERE IS A BOOK WHICH STARTS IN OUR WORLD BUT CONTAINS A FANTASY WORLD THERE HAS TO BE SOME MEANS OF GETTING TO IT AND YOU CAN'T AVOID THE DOOR WE DON'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO GO THROUGH THAT IRON GATE INTO SLADE HAS BUT IT'S NOT VERY NICE AND THERE ARE TWO VERY SINISTER YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSELY LINKED IN FACT THEY COULDN'T BE MORE CLOSELY LINKED IDENTICAL TWINS AND THEY THEY CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES DON'T BE THE MINUTE THEY LEAD THEM
THEY DO THEY WANT SOMETHING FROM THE PERSON AND WHAT THAT THING TO TOOK TO OBTAIN THAT THING WE HAVE TO STRIP LAYERS OFF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING IN IN A PARTICULARLY BESPOKE WAY THEY NEED TO GET INSIDE THE MINDS OF THE VISITORS AND WORK OUT EXACTLY HOW THEY WORK AND WHAT BUTTONS NEED TO BE PRESSED TO MAKE THEM
OVEN READY THERE'S A GREAT FAIRGROUND HAVE THE IMAGINATION GOING ON IN THIS BOOK AS THERE ALWAYS IS AND PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE CAME TO KNOW YOU FIRST WITH CLOUD ATLAS AT THAT EXTRAORDINARY COMPENDIUM OF IDEAS THOUGHTS AND VISIONS
DID YOU ENJOY IT OF THE FILM WHICH WAS AN AMAZING REPRESENTATION OF A BOOK THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO TRANSLATE INTO ANY OTHER MEDIUM YES I DID AND I GOT A GREY IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S MY MOST UNFILMABLE BOOK AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST UNFILMABLE BOOK SO I KNOW THE ONLY ONE SO FAR MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MINEFIELD FROM CONCEPTION TO THE SCREEN SO IT'S ODD IT'S THAT ONE THEY NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES BUT I FELT ALL THE CHANGES WERE LICENSED BY THINGS IN THE BOOK
MANY OF THE ELEMENTS IN YOUR WRITING A FILM IT THERE WHERE YOU CREATE A SCENE THE WAY YOU'D JUMP IN TIME THE THINGS YOU PLAY WERE YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO I SUSPECT LOVES THE SCREEN AND WHAT IT CAN DO
I WAS BORN AT THE END OF THE SIXTIES AND GREW UP IN THIS AGE WHERE THE DOMINANT NARRATIVE
COMES THROUGH THE SCREEN AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE WAR IS
THAT THEIR CHILDHOODS HAVE BECOME SEEPED AND SATURATED WITH VISUAL DRAMA WITH VISUAL NARRATIVE
AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST SHIFTERS OR MOULDERS FORMERS BEHIND HOW THE NOVEL LOOKS NOW
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FILMS AND VISUAL IMAGES BUT ONE PROJECT THAT YOU'VE GOT A RATHER WEIRD ONE I SHOULD ASK YOU TO DESCRIBE IT IN A MINUTE THE FUTURE LIBRARY REALLY IS A DECLARATION OF FAITH IN THE LASTING POWER OF THE NOVEL JUST TELL US WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IF YOU TRY BEFORE JET IS THE BRAINCHILD OF THE SCOTTISH ARTIST CALLED KATIE PATTERSON
IT'S A MONSTER THAT'S GROWING YEAR BY YEAR IT HAS THREE STRANDS ONE IS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIFTEEN A THOUSAND NORWEGIAN SPRUCE TREES WERE PLANTED AS TINY BABY SAPLINGS
IN A FOREST OUTSIDE OSLO THE SECOND STRAND IS TO PERSUADE AND ALSO FROM SOMEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DIFFERENT AGES GENDERS TOO GIVE HER WORK IT MIGHT BE A SHORT STORY IT MIGHT BE A FULL LENGTH NOVEL IT MIGHT BE SOME IN BETWEEN
ONE A YEAR AND NO ONE ELSE CAN EVER SEE IT IF I KNOW WHAT DOCTOR WAYS IT IT'S LOCKED AWAY IN A DEDICATED ROOM IN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN OSLO
AND THEN IN THE YEAR TWENTY ONE FIFTEEN THESE HUNDRED BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCRUING AFTER CENTURY AFTER A CENTURY WILL BE PUBLISHED AND READ FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME MARGARET ATWOOD WENT FIRST LAST YEAR AND I THOUGHT LIFE IT'S GOOD HE MUST HAVE WALKED OUT WHAT ITS CONDITION FOR ME GOOD HEAVENS SO I'M HERE TOO IT'S A SORT OF LOVE LETTER TO THE NOVEL ISN'T IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW WHATEVER HAPPENS
TECHNOLOGICALLY IN THE WORLD AROUND US SOME PEOPLE WILL STILL WANT TO READ WARRANTS ON PAGES THERE WILL STILL BE READ AS THERE WERE SO MANY BOOKS THEY'LL STILL BE TREES AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE STILL BEEN IN NORWAY AND THERE WILL STILL BE CIVILISATION AND ALL THE FORCES OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE FORCES THE POLITICAL FORCES THE INSANITY THAT
JIM'S OUT UTTERS WHEN WE OPEN A NEWSPAPER THESE FORCES WON'T WIN SO THE FUTURE LIBRARY PROJECT IS A DECLARATION IT'S A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THE BOOK AND THE PEOPLE WHO READ THEM
THAT WAS DAVE MITCHELL TALKING TO JIM THE TIME THIRTEEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER HERE A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS DOCTOR A KANG WHO IS A PRIEST IN THE HINDU TRADITION OF BATTY YOGA COMMODITY GOOD MORNING IT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS THIS WEEK THAT SUICIDE IS THE BIGGEST KILLER OF PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE IN THE U.K.
UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER'S RESEARCH INTO SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE INVESTIGATED THE SUICIDES OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY IN ENGLAND AND THE STUDY FOUND THAT PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS ACNE OR ASTHMA EXAM STRESS BEREAVEMENT AND BULLYING WERE THE MOST COMMON TRIGGERS
AS HER MOTHER AND DOCTOR I FIND FIGURES LIKE THIS ARE A WAKE UP CALL WHY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE U.K. A DEVELOPED COUNTRY CHOOSING TO END THEIR LIVES TO RESOLVE THEIR DISTRESS
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE OUR PROBLEMS OR ANY BIGGER OR MORE COMPLICATED I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH OUR SOLUTIONS NEEDING TO GO DEEPER I FOUND A SENSE OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT MAKES US HAPPY HAS BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL FACTORS
THE VEGAS QUITE SENSIBLY RECOMMEND GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH A SAFER ENVIRONMENT LOVING RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF ESTEEM AS ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO LIVING A HEALTHY AND HAPPY LIFE BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A COMMUNITY
HAVE A SELF REALISATION IS SEEN AS THE GOAL AND END RESULT OF THESE THINGS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE AND FOR PHIL US THIS IS ALSO ECHOED BY PSYCHOLOGIST ABRAHAM MASLOW WHO'S WELL KNOWN FOR MEDDLERS HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
SO WHAT DOES SELF REALISATION LOOK LIKE IN ESSENCE THE BUGGER GEETHA DESCRIBES HERSELF REALISED PERSON OR SOMEONE WHO REMAINS ON AN EVEN KEEL IN SUCCESS OR FAILURE KNOWING THAT THESE DO NOT TO FIND THEM
DOES HE OR SHE EXPERIENCES A CONTENTMENT AND SELF CONFIDENCE THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF THINGS LIKE PHYSICAL BEAUTY POPULARITY MATERIAL ACQUISITION AND CRITICISM APPROVAL WHICH CAN ALL FEEL SO EXCRUCIATINGLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE DON'T TAKE A STEP BACK
BUT KRISHNA SAYS THAT IT IS A JOURNEY THAT STARTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND IF NOT THEN AT LEAST FAITH THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THIS STATE OF INNER PEACE AND FOR THIS WE NEED LIVING ROLE MODELS
IMPROVE RESILIENCE IS A WELL KNOWN BY PRODUCT OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICE AND THOUGHT MANY STUDIES HAVE POINTED TO THE FACT THAT CULTIVATING A SENSE OF SELF THAT IS SEPARATE TO WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND US IS BENEFICIAL TO OUR WELL BEING AND HAPPINESS NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT CHILDREN STORE BECOME MEDITATING MONKS BUT I WONDER IF WE GAVE YOUNG PEOPLE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCOVER AND ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS ASPECT OF LIFE BOTH IN THE HOME AND OUTSIDE
WE MIGHT SEE A NEXT GENERATION OF ADULTS BECOME HAPPIER PEACEFUL AND MORE CO OPERATIVE
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH DOCTOR CHECK MACAQUE THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE REFERENDUM INEVITABLY PERHAPS THE WAY THE DEBATE IS BEING CONDUCTED THE WAY IT'S JUST POLITICIAN SHOUTING EACH OTHER AND TELLING WHOPPERS ALL THE TIME
THE WAY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT POLITICALLY ENGAGED FEEL THEY ARE BEING EXCLUDED LETS HER DRESSER WITH A POLITICIAN AND SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A POLITICIAN A POLITICIAN IS AND CAROLINE LUCAS GREEN
PARTY M.P.S SHE'S ON THE BOARD OF BRITAIN STRONGER IN EUROPE AND WITH ME IN THE STUDIO READERS MICHELLE WHO IS A WRITER A CRIME AUTHOR BROADCASTER DOES A BIT OF EVERYTHING BUT AND YOU WANT TO BE ENGAGED BUT YOU SAY THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE NOT POLISH ARMED WHY
WE NOT BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT YOU HAVE IS WHEN YOU WATCH THE TELLY AND WHEN YOU PUT THE WHEN YOU READ THE NEWSPAPERS IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE POLITICIANS HAVING TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES AND LET LET LET'S BE REALISTIC THE LEAVE ANNA REMAIN CAMPAIGN LOOKS LIKE THE TORIES IN FIRE IN THIS SPILLED INTO THE STREET AND THE KNIVES ARE ACTUALLY THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO PEOPLE NOT SURPRISING
IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS MEANT TO BE A NATIONAL DEBATE SO WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT BOTH VISIBLE CAMPAIGNS TO BE DOING IS GIVING PEOPLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION I'M NOT SUPPOSE THEY'RE NOT DENYING INFORMATION THEY'RE NOT DENYING US INFORMATION BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT DOMINATED BY WHEN I PUT MY TEA VIONNET IS DOMINATED BY MEN PREDOMINANTLY MEN IN SUITS MEN WHO HAVE A PARTICULAR AGE
MEN WHO WERE FROM THE SOUTH SO IF YOU PUT ALL THOSE CATEGORIES THEREFORE WHO WERE ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE YOUR BLACKIE YOUNG AND A WOMAN AND YOU'RE GETTING ENGAGED IN HERE WEARING A SUIT I'M NOT BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT MY JOURNEY HOW I'VE GOT TO BE IN THERE TODAY STUDIO TODAY IT HAS BEEN A HARD JOURNEY OF ACCESS SO I THINK THERE'S A BIGGER SOCIAL AND POLITICAL BACKDROP IT IT'S A BACKDROP THAT WE LIVE IN TIMES
WHEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL THAT THEIR VOICES ARE ACTUALLY HURT SO IN BRITAIN WE'VE GOT A HUGE ISSUE ABOUT I DON'T CALL IT DIVERSITY ARE CALLED ABOUT ACCESS WHAT ARE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SO FOR ME YOU COULD BECOME A POLITICIAN IF YOU WANTED TO BE WHICH I DON'T KNOW YOUR CHOICE YEAH BUT IF I WERE STARTING NOW
FROM MY BACKGROUND WHICH IS AN EAST LONDON HOUSING ESTATE STARTING NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD COULD I STRIVE TO BE A POLITICIAN I'M NOT SO SURE THAT I COULD ACTUALLY AND I LIFE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHEN SOCIAL MOBILITY HAS GONE BACKWARDS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND THE EIGHTIES
THERE WAS MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXAMPLE O.K. IT'S GOING TO UNIVERSITY NOW THAN WHEN YOU WERE A KID WHAT TYPES OF CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE IF YOU'VE GOT SOME STATISTICS AS IT'S ALLSORTS BECAUSE I'VE GOT LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON HOUSING ESTATES AND THAT'S THE OTHER ISSUE WHAT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL IS THAT THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T ASPIRE TO GO TO UNIVERSITY BUT THEY DO ASPIRE TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO WE'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT WE'RE CREATING
FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK I THINK I LIVED AT A TIME FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE WHITE WORKING CLASS WAS STILL CELEBRATED WHEN I PUT MY T. V. ON WHAT DO I SEE IN TERMS OF WHITE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE BEEN DEMONISED AND RIDICULED IN REALITY T.V. SHOW
ALL RIGHT LET'S PUT SOME OF THAT TO CAROLINE LUCAS SPECIFICALLY THE BIT OBVIOUSLY COS WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT THE REFERENDUM PRIMARILY THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE OR AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OF THE POLITICAL CLASS ARE BEING EXCLUDED FROM THIS DEBATE TO ACCEPT
SADLY I DO ACCEPT THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED A FAR BROADER AND MORE DIVERSE SET OF VOICES INCLUDING THE VOICES OF YOUNG PEOPLE INCLUDING WOMEN'S VOICES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DEBATE AT THE MOMENT AS TRADER SAYS YOU TURN YOUR RADIO ON AND WITH RESPECT YOU HEAR A LOT OF WHITE MEN SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER AND IT LEAVES MOST PEOPLE COLD
I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT POLITICIANS DO ISN'T IT I THINK THAT IS THE SYSTEM WE IT'S QUITE INTERESTING THAT QUITE A LOT OF WOMEN POLITICIANS ARE SAYING HANG ON A MINUTE COULD YOU EVEN LET OUR VOICES BE ALL RIGHT THERE'S A FEW WOMEN POLITICIANS SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER AS WELL IT'S A FEW IF YOU LISTEN IF YOU LOOK AT ANY ANALYSIS QUITE SERIOUSLY JOHN THE NUMBER OF MALE VOICES MATHS OUTWEIGHS THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND THAT MATTERS BECAUSE AS PETER SAYS IF PEOPLE LOOK AT POLITICS AND DON'T SEE PEOPLE LIKE THEMSELVES ADDRESSING THINGS THAT MATTER TO THEM YOU CAN'T REALLY BLAME THEM FOR SWITCHING OFF
WHERE THIS REALLY WORRIES ME IS WHEN IT COMES TO YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE'S A MASSIVE SET OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON THE ELECTORAL REGISTER THE REGISTER CLOSES ON THE SEVENTH OF JUNE AND IF WE'RE NOT VERY CAREFUL THEN THIS DECISION THAT WILL AFFECT YOUNG PEOPLE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO NOT BE MADE BY YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT GOT REGISTERED I'VE GOT WHY DO YOU THINK IT REALLY PROMISING SO WHAT WHY WHY DO YOU THINK FROM YOUR OBSERVATION WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVEN'T
REGGIE BECAUSE AFTER ALL IF THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED SO BEER THAT'S THEIR CHOICE THAT'S ALSO THE DEMOCRATIC CHOICE ISN'T IT NOT TO TAKE PART I DON'T THINK PEOPLE AREN'T INTERESTED IN THEIR FUTURES I THINK THE TROUBLE WITH THIS DEBATE IS THAT IT'S BEEN AND VERY NARROW ECONOMIC DEBATE AND ALL OF THE BIGGER ISSUES
THE FACT THAT THE E.U. WILL GUARANTEE A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF HOLIDAY OR PART TIME AGENCY WORKERS GIVE THEM THE SAME RIGHTS OR THE FACT THAT IT GIVES US THE STRONGEST WILDLIFE PROTECTION IN THE WORLD THAT WILL PAY LEGISLATION ALL OF THESE ISSUES ON THE EDGE OF THE DEBATE BUT THAT'S YOUR FAULT THAT'S THE FAULT OF THE POLITICIANS WELL THERE'S SOME TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY BUT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THOSE ISSUES ON THE TABLE WHICH IS WHY TODAY IN LONDON THERE'S A HUGE ROUND IT'S GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST POSITIVE
RALEIGH AND WITH SOME INSPIRING MESSAGES ABOUT SAYING ANOTHER EUROPE IS POSSIBLE IT IS POSSIBLE TO COME TOGETHER TO FIGHT FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC AND ACCOUNTABLE BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT THEN YOU MAKE A CASE FOR BRITAIN IN EUROPE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS O.K. IF IT WAS A CASE FOR ANOTHER EUROPE AS WELL ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT BACK AT HIM VERY SMOKE THEM STILL BUT ALL RIGHT TELL ME HOWARD LET ME ASK THE SAME VERY QUICKLY IN THE LAST MINUTE HOW DO YOU GET MORE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THE DEBATE CAROLINE
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME I THINK WE NEED MORE POSITIVE INSPIRING MESSAGES NOT A DAILY DIET OF DOOM AND GLOOM YOU NEED FAR MORE DIVERSE FIRST VOICES YOU NEED WOMEN'S VOICES YOU NEED YOUNG PEOPLE'S VOICES AND YOU NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE POSITIVE MESSAGE ABOUT ALL OF THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT WE GET FROM THE E.U. OR NOT I AM MAYBE OR NOT BUT I THINK AT LEAST LET'S HAVE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T JUST SIMPLY TRADING STATISTICS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS LET'S ACTUALLY HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT WE WANT IN THE WORLD BASICALLY I THINK ALL OF US WANT A WORLD WHERE WE'RE SAFER WELL ALL RIGHT THE CURE
AND THEN LET'S HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE E.U. HELPS US TO ACHIEVE THAT I DO IT DOESN'T DO TO THINK IT WAS I THINK HE DOES AGREE TO THINKS IT DOESN'T BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO I THINK I AGREE WITH CAROLINE BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF HAVING WOMEN'S VOICES YOUNG VOICES YOU HAVE TO UNPICK THAT EVEN MORE
BECAUSE MY WORRY IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WOMEN'S VOICES YOU'RE LOOKING ESSENTIALLY A POLITICIANS ARE YOU LOOKING AT BUSINESS WOMEN YOU'VE GOT TO UNPICK THAT WHERE DID THOSE VOICES COME FROM GEOGRAPHICALLY IN TERMS A CLASS HAVE YOU GOT A RANGE OF DIFFERENT CLASSES SPEAKING
CAROLINE LUCAS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH
THROUGH MY THOMAS SHARP AND I GO HOW'S THE WEATHER THIS MORNING THOMAS THERE IS TALK OF SOME HEAT IN SOME PLACES A YEAR ONLY SOME PLACES NOT EVERYWHERE JUST A VERY GOOD MORNING TO YOU THE WEATHER WILL BE A LITTLE BIT HIT AND MISS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THIS BANK HOLIDAY WEEKEND WE'VE GOT SOME SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE THE MOST AT RISK AREAS CATCHING EVEN SOME DOWNPOURS AND SOME THUNDER AND LIGHTNING

TONIGHT WE'RE LEFT OVER THE CALM AND DRY NIGHT TOMORROW A FEW SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST I THINK ON BALANCE A MARGINALLY SUNNIER AND WARMER DAY PLEASURE MUCH TOM LATER THIS MORNING THERE IS A SPECIAL A VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF MASTER TAPES I WAS THINKING ABOUT JOHN

IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK ON SATURDAY THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MAY THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING A GROUP OF LEADING MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS IS CALLING FOR THE REAL OLYMPICS TO BE POSTPONED OR MOVED BECAUSE OF THE OUTBREAK OF THE SEEKER VIRUS IN BRAZIL
HAVE YOU HAS FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WITH LIFE THREATENING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS HAVE BEING REFUSED SPECIALIST CARE IN ENGLAND TONY BLAIR HAS SUGGESTED THAT ELECTING JEREMY CORBIN AS PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT AND MATILDA IS GETTING SOME SWASH BOGGLING INSPIRATION WITH A DICTIONARY OF HER OWN TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS CORI CORFIELD
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION HAS REJECTED CALLS TO MOVE OR POSTPONE THE RIO OLYMPICS BECAUSE APPEARS ABOUT THE SEEKER VIRUS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SCIENTISTS AND HELP EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE SIGNED A LETTER SAYING THEY ARE CONCERNED THE GAMES WOULD ACCELERATE THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE WHICH HAS BEEN STRONGLY LINKED WITH BIRTH DEFECTS
THE GROUP POINTS OUT THAT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS INCLUDING THE WOMEN'S WORLD CUP IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE WHICH WAS MOVED FROM CHINA BECAUSE OF THE SARS OUTBREAK HALF A MILLION VISITORS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE GAMES IN AUGUST ANDY MORE REPORTS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SAYS TO SEEK A VIRUS IS ALREADY CIRCULATING IN ALMOST SIXTY COUNTRIES AND THERE WAS NO PUBLIC HEALTH JUSTIFICATION FOR POSTPONING ON MOVING THE GAMES
BUT THE EXPERTS WHO HAVE SIGNED THIS OPEN LETTER WORRIED THAT SOME OF THE HALF A MILLION VISITORS TO THE GAMES WILL CARRIED HOME WITH THEM PROFESSOR EDWARD VAN TILING FROM THE CENTRE FOR MIDWIFERY MATERNAL AND PERINATAL HEALTH AT BOURNEMOUTH UNIVERSITY IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK TO POORER COUNTRIES IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM POTENTIALLY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BRAZIL AS A POOR COUNTRY
IT'S THE RISK OF SPREADING THE DISEASE TO OTHER POOR COUNTRIES WHERE MALARIA IS ENDEMIC COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ESPECIALLY IN IN SOUTH ASIA ANOTHER AT THE LETTERS SIGNATORIES SAYS HOLDING THE GAMES IN RIO COULD LEAD TO AN OLYMPICS OF BRAIN DAMAGE AS THE VIRUSES SPREAD GLOBALLY
THE EXPERTS ALSO ALLEGE WHAT THEY CALL AN OVERLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE W.H.O. AND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE THEY CLAIM THAT IT'S LED TO OFFICIALS' PRE JUDGING THE LEVEL OF RISK AND IN EFFECT GIVING THE OLYMPICS A GREEN LIGHT BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS ASSESSED THEY ARE SUGGESTING A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP MIGHT BE NEEDED TO RESTORE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE W.H.O.
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF CHILDREN REFERRED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND LAST YEAR INCLUDING SOME WHO'D ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RECEIVED NO HELP ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT FROM THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER THE REVIEW FOUND HUGE VARIATIONS IN CARE WITH SOME CHILDREN HAVING TO WAIT MONTHS FOR AN APPOINTMENT HE'S A SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL BE CANNON
THE SUPPORTERS THE LATEST DAMNING INDICTMENT OF A SYSTEM THAT IS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY PATIENTS' APPEARANCE PSYCHIATRIST TO BE FEELING TOO MANY CHILDREN FIGURES COLLATED BY THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER FOR ENGLAND PHONE THE TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE REFERRED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE DENIED ANY TREATMENT IN ONE AREA SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT TO REFERRALS WET AND DEEMED TO BE ILL ENOUGH TO RECEIVE SUPPORT
BUT IF YOU ALSO FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WITH LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS INCLUDING SERIOUS SELF HARM WHAT HAVING ATTEMPTED SUICIDE WERE DENIED ANY SPECIALIST CARE WAITING TIMES ALSO VEERED WILDLY FROM FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE NORTH WEST TO TWO HUNDRED DAYS IN THE WEST MIDLANDS MINISTERS SAY THEY INTEND TO INTRODUCE WAITING TIME STANDARDS FOR ALL CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS
THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER FOR ENGLAND DOWN LONGFIELD TOLD US THAT TURNING YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY AMOUNTED TO PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH THEIR HEALTH THIS IS ABOUT LOOKING AT THE LOCAL SYSTEMS IT'S ABOUT RECOGNISING THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THAT CHILDREN ARE IN AND THE DESPERATE NEED FOR HELP AND LOOKING AT HOW THEIR LOCAL SYSTEMS CAN RESPOND TO THAT CLEARLY IN SOME AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS
TONY BLAIR HAS ACCUSED THE CURRENT LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBIN ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE ANY SERIOUS ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY AND SUGGESTED THAT HIS ELECTION AS PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT IN AN INTERVIEW TO BE BROADCAST ON THIS WEEK'S WORLD ON B. B. C. TWO THIS AFTERNOON MISTER BLAIR SAYS THOSE IN THE POLITICAL CENTRE CROWNS NEED TO REGAIN THE INITIATIVE HE WAS SPEAKING TO EMILY MAITLIS
TONY BLAIR IS STILL IN ELECTORAL TERMS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRIME MINISTER THE LABOUR PARTY HAS EVER HAD HE SPENDS A LOT OF HIS TIME IN THE MIDDLE EAST NOW EXPLORING SOLUTIONS TO ISLAMIC EXTREMISM BUT HERE AT HOME HERE REMAINS VILIFIED BY MUCH OF THE ELECTORATE INCLUDING MANY IN HIS OWN PARTY
IN THE INTERVIEW HE DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT THE RISER JEREMY CORBIN WAS A DIRECT REJECTION OF HIM AND HIS POLICIES BUT HE SUGGESTED THE CURRENT LABOUR LEADER WASN'T PROVIDING ANSWERS ON EITHER THE ECONOMY OR ON FOREIGN POLICY
IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR THE CENTRE AND I IN WHEN I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I DO THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT FOR A MAJOR WESTERN COUNTRY TO GET GRIPPED BY THIS TYPE OF POPULIST POLICY MAKING LEFT OR RIGHT
HE ALSO INSISTED THAT THEY DISLIKE MANY FELT FOR HIM WAS LESS TO DO WITH HIS FOREIGN POLICY IN IRAQ AND MORE TO DO WITH THE FACT HE'D WON THREE ELECTIONS FOR THE LABOUR PARTY
A COURT IN ARGENTINA HER SENTENCE THE COUNTRY'S FORMER MILITARY DATA NOW BILL BEEN UNIT TO TWENTY YEARS IN JAIL FOR HIS PART IN A CONSPIRACY BETWEEN SIX SOUTH AMERICAN DICTATORSHIPS DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FOURTEEN OTHER FORMER OFFICERS WERE ALSO SENTENCE FOR THEIR PART IN THE SECRET DEAL KNOWN AS OPERATION CONDOR AS A RESULT OF THE CONSPIRACY MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED LEFT WING ACTIVISTS WERE ABDUCTED TORTURED AND IN SOME CASES KILLED
HE'S ALREADY SERVING PRISON SENTENCES FOR OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PABLO VINEYARD WAS THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN THE TRIAL IN IT THAT WAS YOUR GODDESS TRIAL IS DIFFERENT TO OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF DOCKLANDS WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE DETENTION CENTRE OR IN ONE LOCATION IN ARGENTINA WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN ARGENTINA URUGUAY CHILE BOLIVIA PARAGUAY AND BRAZIL
EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORS HAVE GIVEN THE DRUGS COMPANY GLAXOSMITHKLINE PERMISSION TO MARKET A GENE THERAPY FOR A RARE IMMUNE DISORDER THE ILLNESS AFFECTS ONLY TWO DOZEN BABIES YEAR WORLDWIDE WHO HAVE TO LIVE IN GERM FREE ENVIRONMENTS BUT G.S.K. IS THE FIRST LARGE MULTINATIONAL DRUGS COMPANY TO BE GIVEN APPROVAL FOR A GENE THERAPY AND IT'S HOPED THE DECISION WOULD BE TO OTHER TREATMENTS ARE MORE WIDESPREAD CONDITIONS HE'S OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT PARROT GOES
HUNDREDS OF INHERITED DISORDERS SUCH AS CYSTIC FIBROSIS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND MANY TYPES OF BLINDNESS ARE CAUSED BY FAULTY GENES
THE AIM OF THE GENE THERAPY IS TO CURE THE DISEASE BY INTRODUCING HEALTHY COPIES OF THE GENE INTO THE PATIENT THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF THE TREATMENT IS THAT IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE GIVEN ONCE AND POTENTIALLY IT OFFERS A PERMANENT CURE
THE IDEA FIRST EMERGED WITH MUCH HYPE OR THIRTY YEARS AGO AT THE TIME IT'S ADVOCATE SAID IT WOULD CURE EVERYTHING FOR TWENTY YEARS IT HAD CURED NOTHING
THE PRACTICALITIES OF INTRODUCING THE RIGHT GENE INTO THE RIGHT CELLS PROVED MORE DIFFICULT THAN FIRST THOUGHT BUT IN RECENT YEARS EARLY DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN OVERCOME AND REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO GIVE THE GO AHEAD TO BORE GENE THERAPIES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS
OFFICIALS IN WESTERN CANADA HAVE CONFIRMED THAT REMAINS FOUND ON CYPRESS MOUNTAIN THE BANK COOPER ARE THOSE OF A BRITISH TOURIST WHO HADN'T BEEN SEEN FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS TOM BILLINGS HE WAS TWENTY TWO AND FROM OXFORD WAS LAST SEEN HIKING IN NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRTEEN HIS REMAINS WERE FOUND LAST MONTH THE AUTHORITIES DON'T BELIEVE HIS DEATH WAS SUSPICIOUS

BUT IN THEIR LETTER TO THE ENERGY SECRETARY AMBER RUDD SIX SMALLER ENERGY FIRMS CLAIMED THAT THAT WOULD DETER COMPETITION THEY SAID THAT IN PRACTICE CONSUMER SEARCHES ON PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES WOULD ONLY END UP SHOWING OFFERS FROM THE BIG SIX SUPPLIERS AND CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT THE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS TAKING ACTION TO ENSURE BILL PAYERS GOT A FAIR DEAL BY MAKING SWITCHING QUICKER AND EASIER
EXPERT SEND GOBBLED FUNK WON'T NEED IT BUT OTHERS MAY FIND IT HELPFUL WHEN NEW DICTIONARY BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THE GLORY YUMPTIOUS WORKS CREATED BY ROALD DAHL THE DICTIONARY WHICH IS BEING PRODUCED TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE WRITER'S BIRTH TAKEN FIVE YEARS TO COMPILE AND CONTAINS ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND WORDS BOTH REAL AND INVENTED ARTS CORRESPONDENT REBEKAH JONES TAKES UP THE STORY
HER WINK BALD AND SLEEPS WIGGLER WORDS YOU WON'T HAVE HEARD OF UNTIL NOW
THEY WERE INVENTED BY ROLL DULL WHO SCRIBBLED THEM ON YELLOW PAGES FROM THE AMERICAN LEGAL PADS HE USED TO WRITE IN BUT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY MADE IT INTO ANY OF HIS NOVELS THEY WERE DISCOVERED IN HIS ARCHIVE DURING RESEARCH FOR THE NEW DICTIONARY
MANY OTHER MADE UP WORDS DID APPEAR IN PRINT THOUGH REMEMBER FLOB ROB SCOTT ALL FROM THE B. F. G. THE FIZZY LIQUID WHOSE BUBBLES TRAVELLED DOWNWARDS ROLL DULL ONCE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT HIS READERS TO GET SO BORED THEY CLOSED THEIR BOOKS AND WATCH TELEVISION INSTEAD SO TO MAKE HIS STORIES AS ENTERTAINING AS POSSIBLE HE WOULD BLEND WORD SPELL THEM BACKWARDS AND SWAP LETTERS JUST THINK OF SWASHBUCKLING AND SCRUM DIDDLY UMPTIOUS
REBEKAH JONES REPORTING THE TIME TEN PAST EIGHT IF A TEENAGER BREAKS A LEG HE OR SHE WILL BE TREATED BY THE N.H.S. IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE TEENAGER HAS A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS THE SUGGESTION THIS MORNING IS THAT THE TREATMENT THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES THERE'S OFTEN NOT PROVIDED OR PROVIDED VERY LATE THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER SAYS A QUARTER OF THE CHILDREN REFERRED FOR SPECIALIST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO NOT GET ANY TREATMENT AT ALL
LET'S TALK FIRST TO ELLIE FODEN WHO IS HERE IN THE STUDIO AS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD HELLO HELLO TO YOU YOU WERE SIXTEEN WHEN YOU WERE NEW
BECAME ILL WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU UM WELL I DON'T BECOME ILL LIKE IMMEDIATELY IT SIXTEEN WHAT HAPPENED ONCE FOR A NUMBER YEARS I FELT
QUITE DOWN SO TO SPEAK IT WASN'T JUST FEELING DOWN IT WAS
IT'S CONSTANT WORRYING AND FRESH FROM SCHOOL AND IT'S SORT OF MY OWN BODY IMAGE AS WELL HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH ME YEAH SAD SORT OF DISMISSED IT AND TRIED TO GET ON AND WHEN YOU WERE SIXTEEN
YOU SOUGHT HELP I'D GOT TO A POINT WHERE I WAS LIKE I'VE HAD ENOUGH I'VE AND WAKING UP EVERY DAY AND I'M NOT
WANTING TO YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING NOT VERY RIGHT SO WHAT I DID WAS I SELF REFERRED TO A LOCAL COUNSELLING SERVICE
AND I WAS ON A WAITING LIST FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND THEN I STARTED SESSIONS AND THE COUNCILLOR WHO I WAS SAYING WAS
VERY WORRIED SO SHE REFERRED ME TO CAMS AND CHEER WHICH IS CHILD ADULT MENTAL HEALTH THEY DID WHAT
WELL I WAS SET TO GO TO DOCTORS GET A REFERRAL IT WASN'T JUST ENOUGH TO HAVE A COUNSELLOR'S REFERRAL AND IT TOOK ABOUT
THREE TO FOUR WEEKS TO GET A SESSION AND I'VE GOT A SESSION WITH THIS IT'S ONE PERSON AND I WAS IN THERE FOR ABOUT
I'M FOR THREE HOURS I THINK AND I WAS JUST BOMBARDED WITH SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT SOME OF THEM I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE ANSWER FOR BECAUSE I THINK
IT WAS BAD THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY OWN HEAD SO I CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS WELL ENOUGH TO GET ANY PROPER HELP BUT WHAT WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDE THEN WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HELP TO YOU AT THAT AGE OF SIXTEEN I THINK
SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH COS I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I FELT SO BAD WHICH WAS PART OF THE PROBLEM
DID YOU THINK YOU WEREN'T TAKEN SERIOUSLY ALL THE SERIES NICE OF WHAT YOU WERE FEELING WASN'T NO BECAUSE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FOR SORT OF DIS NESTERS OH IT'S NOT THAT BAD PEOPLE HAVE IT WORSE WHEN FOR ME IT FELT AWFUL
SO I THOUGHT OH YEAH I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT SO WHY AM I FEELING LIKE THAT THEY WERE IT WAS LIKE THERE WASN'T ANY SORT OF LEVEL OF COMPASSION AND IT MADE IT SO MUCH WORSE
HOW DID IT WORK OUT IN THE END AND IN THAT I MEAN YOU OBVIOUSLY DID HAVE SOME TREATMENT INTRODUCED STOP IT DID YOU PULL OUT WHAT WHAT I DIDN'T GO BACK FOR ANOTHER CAMHS APPOINTMENT
BECAUSE I HEARD A CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER IS SAYING THAT ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEN THEY DON'T GO BACK YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEN YOU JUST GET STRUCK OFF THEY ASSUME THAT'S THAT'S YOU SORTED AS IT WERE
GENUINELY TERRIFIED ME HONESTLY FRIGHTEN THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME SO I NEVER WENT BACK
I FINISHED COUNSELLING AT THIS INDEPENDENT SERVICE AND I WASN'T GREAT BUT I WASN'T AS BAD
AND THEN AS I'VE GROWN OLDER IT'S JUST GONE INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL WORM CURRENTLY AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME WORSE THAN I WAS WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN WITH DEPRESSION YEAH WITH THE PRESSURE AND YOU YOU CAN'T KNOW AND IN A WAY IT'S A RIDICULOUS QUESTION BUT IS THERE DO YOU THINK A POSSIBILITY THAT IF YOU'D BEEN BETTER TREATED
WITH TREATMENT THAT ACTUALLY WORKED AND FOLLOWED UP ON WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG WHEN YOU WERE SIXTEEN WHICH STILL YOUNG BUT WHEN YOU WERE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD THAT ACTUALLY THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED YOU GETTING INTO THE DIFFICULTIES YOU'VE GOT INTO YOU KNOW YEAH I THINK A MASSIVE PART OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE NOW IS SOME STUFF THAT WAS SAID IN THAT SESSION
NOT BEING FOLLOWED UP OR NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY TO START OFF WITH YOU KNOW I'VE GOT THIS CONSTANT THING OF WHY WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS COS I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL LIKE THIS WHY DO I I'VE GOT A GREAT LIFE
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE NO REASON TO BE SAD AND I THINK QUITE A LOT OF THAT STEM FROM THAT ONE SESSION I HAD
RIGHT ELLIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US ANY FOGGED IN NINETEEN AND LET'S TALK NOW TO JAMES MORRIS IS A CONSERVATIVE M.P. WHO CHAIRS THE ALL PARTY GROUP ON MENTAL HEALTH AND IS HERE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING AND NATASHA DEVON AS WELL HAVE A THINK IS ON THE LINE IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S MENTAL HEALTH CHAMPION THERE ACTUALLY LOST HER JOB JUST LAST MONTH YOU ON THE LINE THAT I SHOULD
I AM HELLO THERE JAMES MORRIS FIRST EVOLVED IT WENT WHEN YOU LISTENED TO WHAT WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM ANY FELT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER AS WELL WE WERE TALKING TO EARLIER ON IN THE PROGRAMME DO YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE IS
A REAL PROBLEM THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING IT RIGHT AT THE MOMENT YES I DO I THINK THAT CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE'S BEEN PROBLEMS BUILDING UP IN THE SYSTEM OVER MANY YEARS UNDER GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH POLITICAL PERSUASIONS ACTUALLY
SO YES I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ALI'S TESTIMONY THERE IS THAT WE NEED AS THE RECENT INDEPENDENT TASK FORCE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS TO N.H.S. ENGLAND POINTED OUT WE NEED TO HAVE A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION WITH A CHANGE IN THE WAY IN WHICH CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE COMMISSIONED IN THE N.H.S.
MAKING IT MORE RESPONSIVE ENSURING THAT WE GET EARLIER AND EARLIER INTERVENTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY BECOME SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH REQUIRE THIS KIND OF SPECIALIST CARE WHICH IS REFERRED TO IN THIS REPORT NATASHA DEVON DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT IS UP TO BRINGING US THAT CHANGE
I THINK WHAT'S MISSING QUITE OFTEN FROM THIS CONVERSATION IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT IT IT CAN BE ON A CONTINUUM SO IT IS INTERESTING WHAT WAS BEING SAID THERE ABOUT IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS IN THE EARLY STAGES AND I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ROOT CAUSES SO ANXIETY FOR EXAMPLE IS THE FASTEST GROWING ILLNESS IN UNDER TWENTY ONES
WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEIR CULTURE AND THE SOCIETY THAT THEY LIVE IN THE PRESSURES THAT ARE ON THEM IN ORDER TO HAVE CAUSED THAT PHENOMENON
SO RATHER THAN PROVIDING OR SORT OF MEDICAL ISING WHAT IS ACTUALLY JUST A RESPONSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE IN AND I FEEL THAT THAT'S A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT'S OFTEN NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SCHEDULING POINT THAT ISN'T IT JAMES MORRIS YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO ME TO A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S WHERE THERE'S EARLIER INTERVENTION WE HAVE A MORE COMPASSIONATE SYSTEM WE ALSO NEED TO WE NEED TO STOP PUTTING THE KINDS OF PRESSURES ON CHILDREN
WE DO YEAH AND THERE'S LOTS OF EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE NOT LOTS OF REASONS FOR THAT BUT WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS THESE ISSUES ABOUT WAITING TIMES WE THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED TO INTRODUCING WAITING TIME STANDARDS FOR ACCESS TO CHILD ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH BY APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN
THERE'S BEEN ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION OF NEW MONEY OVER THIS PARLIAMENT NOW THERE IS A HUGE IMPLEMENTATION TASK BECAUSE AS I SAY A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS HAVE BUILT UP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT BUT THERE IS A MATURE CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING AND THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON THE GROUND WITH A RECOGNITION
THE CROSS PARTY RECOGNITION ACTUALLY OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS NOW THE CHALLENGE IS TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGE ON THE GROUND ON THAT POINT ABOUT FUNDING NATASHA DEBENHAM IS IT IT IS INTERESTING THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER IS CLAIMING IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY QUITE SERIOUSLY ILL ARE BEING TURNED AWAY AND YOU'VE GOTTA WONDER WHETHER FUNDING IS PART OF THE MANCHESTER JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO MANAGE A CASE LIKE THAT AND ALSO THIS QUESTION OF PEOPLE I DON'T THEN TURN UP FOR AN APPOINTMENT BEING STRUCK OFF
REGISTER HE DID IT HIS HIS HIS FUNDING AT LEAST PART OF THE PROBLEM
I THINK THE FUNDING IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND AS ELLIE'S STORY DEMONSTRATED WHEN YOU FIRST ADMIT THAT YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS IT'S SUCH A CRUCIAL TIME IT'S SUCH A BIG THING TO GO TO A PROFESSIONAL AND TIT TO ACTUALLY ADMIT AND THEN IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF WAITING PERIOD WHERE YOU'RE IN LIMBO IT POTENTIALLY EAT THAT YOU SORT OF LOSE THE MOMENTUM
AND I KNOW THAT I HEARD ALISTAIR BURT SAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING TOWARDS A TARGET OF NO LONGER THAN SEVENTEEN WEEK HE'S A MINISTER AND DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT YES THAT THE MINISTER IN THE SOCIAL CARE AND SEVENTEEN WEEKS I HAD TO POINT OUT TO HIM AND I SAID TO ME DO YOU REMEMBER HOW LONG YOUR SIX WEEK SUMMER HOLIDAY SEEMED WHEN YOU WERE THIRTEEN AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST THREE TIMES AS LONG AS THAT WITH WITH NOTHING TO KIND OF MEDIATE THAT TIME BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT
SO I THINK THAT THAT FUNDING YES EXTRA FUNDING WOULD HELP BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MENTAL ILLNESS HAPPENS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A PERSON AND START TREATING PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS RATHER THAN CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS JAMES MORRIS DID IT THERE IS A CULTURAL THING HE'S NOW STARTED OFF BY SAYING IF YOU BREAK YOUR LEG YOU YOU GET TREATED
IF YOU'VE GOT A MENTALLY I WASN'T RESTORED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT THAT IS GOING TO BE EXPENDED ON YOU BUT THE FACT IS
BUT CULTURALLY WE ARE STILL MAKING THE CHANGE REALLY AREN'T THEY ABSENT WARDS TREATING MENTAL ILLNESS AS SERIOUSLY AS WE DO TREAT YOU ABSOLUTELY WE'RE NOT THEY IT'S IT'S AN UNACCEPTABLE THAT SOMEBODY HE'S SUFFERING FROM A SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM SHOULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO CARE THAT SHOULD BE A PRINCIPAL
WHICH DRIVES OUR APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTH AS I WAS SAYING THIS IS BUILT UP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE HAVE AT THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM IS SHARED IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT WE DO NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE COMPASSIONATE SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THE TRANSFORMATION IS GOING TO TAKE TIME IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IS GOING TO REQUIRE BETTER COMMISSIONING
ON THE GROUND AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THAT TO THE POINT WHERE YOU GET THAT RESPONSE OF SERVICE THAT WE NEED THIS BIG IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES BUT REALLY WHICH ARE STARTING ON A JOURNEY IF WE WERE TO IF WE WERE TO INVENT A SYSTEM FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH WE WOULDN'T START WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND WE NEED TO DRIVE CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE KIND OF CARE THAT ELLIE AND ANOTHER PEOPLE LIKE I DESERVE THAT THERE WILL BE PEOPLE NATASHA DEVON HE JUST THROW THEIR HANDS UP AND SAY
GOODNESS WE ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO BE SPENDING THE KINDS OF SUMS THAT WE SHOULD BE ON THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY THE REST OF THE SET MUST HAVE THEM THEIR SERVICE FOR PHYSICAL OURS IS IT
MASSIVELY MASSIVELY STRETCHED AND THEY MIGHT POINT TO YOU BEING GOT RID OF BY THE GOVERNMENT AS IT'S MENTAL HEALTH CHAMPION ANY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THEY PUT YOU IN PLACE AS EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY REALLY FOR ALL THE RHETORIC WE'RE NOT TAKING IT THAT SERIOUSLY
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN THE PARITY OF ESTEEM BETWEEN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH WAS PROMISED IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH HAS REDUCED SINCE THEN
EVEN THOUGH APPARENTLY MONEY IS BEING PUT INTO THE SYSTEM IT'S NOT RING FENCED SO THE INVESTMENT THAT'S BEING PUT INTO MENTAL HEALTH HAS ONLY RESULTED IN HALF OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES INCREASING THEIR SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH IN REAL TERMS SO FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I CAN SEE THAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE A LOT OF NOISE WITHOUT ANY REAL ACTION ON THE GROUND BUT I THINK I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE REASON THAT I WAS LET GO FROM THE IS BECAUSE
I WAS LISTENING TO WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE THE REASONS FOR THEIR ANXIETY IN THIS IS BACKED UP BY STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE CHARITY YOUNG MINDS AND MOST OF THE TIME THEY WERE THE RESULT OF AUSTERITY IT WAS THINGS LIKE POVERTY AND IT WAS ALSO THE PROSPECT OF BEING UNEMPLOYED STUDENT DEBT
IT WAS ALSO THE CHANGES TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE AMOUNT OF ACADEMIC AN EXAM PRESSURE THAT THEY WERE UNDER AND THESE ARE ALL POLICIES WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY THIS GOVERNMENT AND THE COALITION BEFORE THEM SO TO IT TO A DEGREE THEY'RE KIND OF CAUSING SOME OF THE ISSUES AND THAT WAS THE UNPOPULAR OPINION THAT I PUT OUT THERE ALL RIGHT WE'LL LEAVE THAT OPINION HANGING THERE FOR NOW COS WE'VE GOT IT WE RUN OUT OF TIME BUT NATASHA DEVON THANK YOU VERY MUCH JAMES MORRIS AS WELL AND ELLIE FUCKED IN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU
TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST EIGHT THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL IS PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS IN THE UNITED STATES ITS LONG TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES OF IT PRETTY RUGGED IN PLACES BUT NOT PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SO LONG AS YOU STICK TO THE PATH GERALDINE LAA GAY DIDN'T SHE WAS HIKING ALONE LEFT THE PAST TO RELIEVE HERSELF AND WAS NEVER SEEN ALIVE AGAIN HER BODY WAS FOUND ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER SHE VANISHED HERE'S PART OF THE LAST ENTRY SHE WROTE IN HER DIARY WHEN YOU FIND MY BODY PLEASE CALL MY HUSBAND GEORGE AND MY DAUGHTER KERRY
IT WILL BE THE GREATEST KINDNESS FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT I'M DEAD AND WHERE YOU FOUND ME NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS FROM NOW
PLEASE FIND IT IN YOUR HEART TO MAIL THE CONTENTS OF THIS BAG TO ONE OF THEM
ONE OF THE TEAM WHO INVESTIGATED HER DISAPPEARANCE WROTE THAT IF LAKI HAD WALKED JUST THIRTY MINUTES FROM WHERE SHE ENDED UP CAMPING SHE'D HAVE FOUND A CLEAR ROAD THAT LED HER TO ACCOMMODATION AND SAFETY SO WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE AND WHAT ABOUT THESE PATHS
STRETCH SUCH GREAT DISTANCES THROUGH SOME WILDERNESSES I'M TALKED JOINED ON THE LINE BY DOCTOR LISA FENTON HE WAS AN INSTRUCTOR IN BUSHCRAFT AND SURVIVAL SKILLS AND KEITH ASK IF IT IS A LONG DISTANCE HIKER VIEW I THINK MY HEIGHT THE THE WHOLE OF THE APPELLATION TRADE YOURSELF I DID IT IN TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY STORY SHE JUST LEFT THE PUB SHE DIDN'T GO MORE THAN ABOUT THIRTY YARDS APPARENTLY FROM THE PART OF THE RIDGE
IT IT DOES SEEM SURPRISING POSSIBLY EVEN UNLIKELY BUT WHEN I FIRST READ THE REPORTS YESTERDAY
OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT SHE HE'S GONE OFF THE PAST TO RELIEVE HERSELF IT HAD A REALLY UNEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH AS I'VE BEEN IN EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION ON THE APPELLATION TRIAL
OBVIOUSLY MOST OF THE TIME WE SORT OF WALKED TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIFTY FEET OFF INTO THE WOODS TO RELIEVE OURSELVES
THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION I SORT OF TURN ROUND TO GO BACK TO THE TRAIN AND I WAS COMPLETELY DISORIENTATED AS YOU JUST SURROUNDED BY INJURY
SO IT WAS A VERY UNEASY FEELING WHEN I READ ABOUT WHAT WHAT IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND DOCTOR FENTON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT YEAH IN IT
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A TRAGIC STORY AND IT IS EASY TO GET TURNED AROUND WHEN YOU LEAVE THE TRAIL IT'S HAPPENED TO ME ALSO TURNED AROUND THAT'S AN INTERESTING EXPRESSION YES JUST AN EXPRESSION FOR GOING OFF THEY GUESS AGAIN DISORIENTATED SO YOU LITERALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION YOU'RE FACING IN ALL MEANT TO BE PACING IT SPENT A LOT TIME IN JUNGLES AND IT'S PARTICULARLY EASY IN THE JUNGLE TO GET TURNED AROUND OR DISORIENTATED YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT HORRIBLE
UNEASY FEELING IN THE PIT OF YOUR STOMACH THAT THAT YOU SAID TO ME THAT DOES THE FEELING OR PANIC BEGINS TO RISE AND THAT STARTS TO FEELING THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO COME BACK WE'RE GETTING REPORTS JUST THIS MORNING JUST IN THE LAST FEW HOURS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN TOM BUILDINGS TWENTY TWO FROM OXFORD HE
WENT WALKING IN NORTH AMERICA IN FACT HE WAS IN CANADA HE WAS NEAR VANCOUVER IN THE HILLS AROUND VANCOUVER PENALTIES FOR AT THE NORTH TOR MOUNTAINS I THINK THEY CALLED AND HE HIS REMAINS HAVE BEEN FOUND AND IN FACT IT'S TWO YEARS AGO THAT HE WENT MISSING SO PERHAPS IN SOME WAYS A SIMILAR CASE BUT I WONDER WHETHER FOR BOTH OF YOU THIS QUESTION IS IS RELEVANT
IS IT A MISTAKE TO GO OFF WALKING IN AREAS LIKE THIS BY YOURSELF SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE COMPANY KEITH I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ESTATE
WALKING WITH YOURSELF IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE COAST OF THE APPELLATION TRIAL I THINK WHEN I WALKED IT THREE YEARS AGO THERE WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ATTEMPTING A SIMILAR THING REALLY
ALBEIT OVER THE COURSE OF SORT OF FOUR FIVE SIX MONTHS SO THEY TEND TO SPREAD OUT SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO SEE HER PURSE AND SOME DAYS YOU CAN SEE SORT OF TEN OR FIFTEEN SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE NEVER REALLY ALONE I MEAN I I WENT OUT THERE TO WALK AT BY MYSELF I MET PEOPLE WHEN I WAS OUT THERE AND ENDED UP FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS WALKING WITH THAT GROUP
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GO OUT THERE TO DO IT JUST FOR THE SOLITUDE TO THEN SORT ASIDE NO YOU'VE GOT TO WALK IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT JUST WOULDN'T WORK AT PEOPLE I DO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING INHERENTLY DANGEROUS AND DOING IT ON YOUR OWN I THINK IT'S POSSIBLY BECOMES INHERENTLY DANGEROUS WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
CASE IN POINT HERE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SITUATION THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY RESULTED IN DEATH I'M NOT SAYING JODIE IS AN EXPERIENCE WE STILL MY STEAKS AND SHE HAD BEEN WALKING ON TIME SHE WAS IN HER SIXTIES WASN'T SHE AND SHE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WALKER WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT THE WALKING BY YOURSELF AT THESE OFFEND HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH KEITH AND YOU KNOW I DO I THINK THE WALKING BY YOURSELF IS FINE I THINK
THE IMPORTANT PART IS RELEVANT TO YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S NOT A COMMON AND GERALDINE AT ALL BUT JUST SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF THAT OBVIOUSLY WALKING OUT ALONE IT REQUIRES MORE EXPERIENCE JUST QUICKLY IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS IF YOU WOULD A QUICK BIT OF ADVICE FROM BOTH OF YOU TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS SORT OF THING BY THEMSELVES LISA PHANTOM
WELL A QUICK BIT OF ADVICE ON IF YOU BECOME DISORIENTATED IF YOU GO OFF THE TRAIL IS TO TRY TO TRACK YOURSELF TRACK YOUR MOVEMENTS BACK THROUGH THE WOODS AND ALSO TO TRY NOT TO PANIC YOU MIGHT NEED TO JUST SIT DOWN FOR A LITTLE WHILE I MAKE A CUP OF TEA IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TRIED TO GET YOUR HEAD DON'T GO CHARGING OFF IN ONE ABSOLUTELY DON'T DO THAT
I'D AGREE WITH MARK IF IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW MARK YOUR TRAIL WHICH WHERE YOU COME FROM SO THEY KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO ABOUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IF YOU GOING OUT THERE BE PREPARED HAVE SOMEWHERE YOU CAN STAY DRY MAKE SURE HE CAN STAY WARM MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT WATER KEITH ASK AT LOSER FENTON THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

THAT'S ALL COMING UP AFTER NINE THANKS BOTH LOOK AT THE WEATHER WARM SUNSHINE AT LEAST IN SOME PLACES THUNDERY SHOWERS THOUGH IN THE SOUTH AND THE WEST YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JUSTIN WHETHER JOHN HUMPHRYS TWENTY FIVE TO NINE A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FROM CORRIE CORFIELD THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION HAS DISMISSED TO CALL FROM MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS FOR THE RIO OLYMPICS TO BE MOVED OR POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE SEEKER VIRUS OUTBREAK IN BRAZIL THE W.H.O. HAS SAID THAT CANCELLING OR CHANGING THE LOCATION OF THE GAMES WOULD NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS
A NEW REPORT SAYS OVER A QUARTER OF CHILDREN PREFER TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ENGLAND LAST YEAR INCLUDING SOME WHO'D ATTEMPTED SUICIDE RECEIVED NO HELP THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSIONER ALSO FOUND THAT SOME CHILDREN HAD TO WAIT MONTHS FOR AN APPOINTMENT TONY BLAIR ARE SENT TO JEREMY CORBIN SELECTION AS PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT IN A B. B. C. INTERVIEW MISTER BLAIR HAS ACCUSED THE CURRENT LABOUR LEADER FAILING TO PROVIDE SERIOUS ANSWERS TO THE ECONOMICAL FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY
A COURT IN ARGENTINA HAS CONVICTED A GROUP OF FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS OF CONSPIRING TO ABDUCT AND KILL LEFT WING OPPONENTS ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA FOR DECADES AGO A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION WERE INVOLVED IN THE PLAN KNOWN AS OPERATION CONDOR
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES HAVE THEY BEEN CANCELLED OR POSTPONED OR MOVED SOMEWHERE ELSE AT THE LAST MINUTE THIS YEAR'S MIGHT MAKE HISTORY A GROUP OF MEDICAL EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT BE HELD IN BRAZIL BECAUSE OF THE ZEKE VIRUS HERE'S WHAT ONE OF THEM PROFESSOR EDWIN AND TANIKA TOLD ME AN HOUR AGO
MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE A LINK BETWEEN D. I.O.C. ENDED W.H.O. THEY SIGNED UP AS OFFICIAL PARTNERS AND THEY
A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT AND ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE LETTER IS A CALL TO HAVE INDEPENDENT EXPERTS LOOKING AT THE DATA AVAILABLE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND ON CHANGING THE GAMES BUT I HOPE THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR MINDS AND HAVING AN INDEPENDENT COMMITTEE LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE
AND DO THAT SOON AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WE'VE ASKED THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION TO COLIN AND WE'RE HOPING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY FROM THAT ORGANISATION BEFORE THE PROGRAMME'S OUT IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IDEALLY BUT LET'S HEAR ANOTHER COMMON IT FROM DOCTOR TOM FRIEDMAN WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE U.S. CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
THE RISK IS TO PREGNANT WOMEN AND THAT'S WHAT OUR ADVICE IS ABOUT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT YOU SHOULDN'T TRAVEL IF YOU'RE PREGNANT THEN YOU NEED TO TRAVEL YOU NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT RISK AND FOR MEN WHO TRAVEL
WHOSE PARTNERS ARE PREGNANT WE NEED TO USE A CONDOM ONE CLAIM IS IT ME SPREADS THROUGH TRAVEL BUT THE OLYMPIC SORRY TINY FRACTION OF ALL TRAVEL THERE IS A GLOBAL TRAVEL WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE
WELL I JOINED BY SOMEBODY FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ALEXANDER GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THIS LETTER SPECIFICALLY TO WHAT PROFESSOR FRONT TOLD ME AN HOUR AGO WHEN HE SAID YOUR ORGANISATION THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ARE A BIT TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT THERE IS A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVEN'T MADE PUBLIC
BRAND OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN GARBAGE SHOWING VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS IS MAKING JUDGEMENTS THAT I BASED IT ON BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY OR W.H.O. NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT TRAVEL TO GRIP OH OUI I THINK THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULDN'T TRAVELLED BILL ANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE WE I THINK AS DOCTOR STEPHEN POINTED OUT IF YOU ARE A MAN TRAVELLING
PICTURE AND I THINK THAT QUITE EASILY FOR THIS KIND OF CONFUSING TO BE EXPANDED BUT THE REAL POINT IS WHY DID STARTING THE GAME INTO
TO MAKE IT THEIR WAY AROUND THE GLOBE
BUT SURELY IT IT'S TESTIFIES COMMONSENSE SUGGESTS THAT IF YOU HAVE THE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ARRIVING IN BRAZIL DURING THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE GAME AS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD GOING BACK TO LOTS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO HAVE MOSQUITOES OF THEIR OWN AND SO ON AND SO ON AND SO IT DEFIES IMAGINATION THAT THAT AT LEAST SOME EXTRA CASES WILL BE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AND THEN THAT INCREASES THE DANGER OF AN EPIDEMIC
TRUE AND HUM BRAZIL EVERY MAP IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY WILL TRAVEL FOR THE OTHER THING IT WILL BE THE MOWER SO WET THEY'VE DIFFERENT YOUNG DO YOU PLACE THAT WAS MADE MONTHS AGO WHEN YOU MAKEEKI COMEDIAN
GLOBAL TRAVEL BACK BY THE AREA NO
ALL RIGHT I KNOW WHAT'S REQUIRED THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT IN FACT IT DOUBLE BECAUSE
WELL I DID BUT I HAVE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THE LINE IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH US DOCTOR CHRIS SMITH HE WAS A CONSULTANT NEUROLOGIST AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AND HEATHER FELL WHO WERE THE CELLS ARE FORMER BRITISH OLYMPIC PENTATHLETE FREELANCE JOURNALIST DOCTOR SMITH YOU'VE HEARD WHAT BOTH SIDES AS IT WERE HAVE TO SAY WHAT'S YOUR VIEW SHOULD THE GAMES SHOULD THEY CONSIDER COUNSELLING POSTPONING MOVING THE GAMES
WE SHOULDN'T BE COMPLACENT ABOUT EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IF IT CAN BE EXPLAINED AS SIMPLY AS THIS IS JUST PEOPLE MOVING AROUND THE WORLD THEN WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY DESPITE THE DISCOVERY OF ZEKE A VIRUS IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN IN A JUNGLE IN UGANDA AFRICA WHY IT HAS TAKEN UNTIL TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR THIS AGENT TO ARRIVE IN BRAZIL IT WAS NEVER DETECTED THERE BEFORE TWENTY THIRTEEN WE CURRENTLY THINK BUT IT MAY BE A SPORTING FIXTURE
AT THAT SORT OF TIME THAT BROUGHT THE VIRUS TO BRAZIL IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT IT ISN'T YOU'VE GOT GONE AND MY REAL CONCERN IS YES WE'VE GOT A MILLION PEOPLE AIRBORNE AROUND THE PLANET ABOARD AEROPLANES AT ANY MOMENT IN TIME AND YES THERE IS HUGE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF PEOPLE TRAVELLING ROUND BUT IF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COALESCE IN ONE PLACE AND THEY INCLUDE PEOPLE BROUGHT IN FROM POOR COUNTRIES
WHO DON'T HAVE VERY GOOD HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEY THEN DO PICK UP CASES AND THEY GO BACK TO THOSE POORER COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S POOR PUBLIC HEALTH MONITORING THIS POOR PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION AND POOR HEALTH SERVICES THEN THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEM COULD BE MORE SEVERE SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE IF WE DO GO AHEAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SORT OF EVENTUALITY DOESN'T IT NEITHER WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT NIGGER ALEXANDER
ONE MILLION AIRBORNE PEOPLE AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE DON'T WE NEED PLANS IN PLACE AND THAT WHY DO YOU FIGHT IS TO AVOID GETTING BITTEN I'M A SKI DOES EQUAL THAT'S WHY YOU'RE IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT
EXCELLENT UP YOURSELF I'M GETTING ALL RIGHT NO LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION ARE YOU PREPARED AT THIS STAGE
EVEN TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND STOPPING THE GAMES IN BRAZIL IS THAT A POSSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION
NO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT UP THERE DID YOU ARE ADVISING THE I.O.C.
RIGHT I MAKE THAT CHANGE
RIGHT YOU'RE STILL MONITORING CLOSELY SO THAT MIGHT CHANGE IT MIGHT BE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WE DON'T HAVE VERY LONG TO GO OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS YOUR ADVICE MIGHT CHANGE
I WOULDN'T THINK SO I YOU'RE LOOKING AT WON'T WE AND THE VIRUS HAS NOT CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE CHRIS BEHAVING THE SAME WAY IN A TERRIBLE WAY AND SPREADING ACROSS MANY COUNTRIES BUT IT'S NOT CHANGING IN ANY WAY ON TRANSISTOR ABILITY FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT WOULD BE CUTE ALL RIGHT THANKS IS THERE BUT LET'S ASK HEATHER SELLS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SOMEBODY WHO'S TRAVELLED THE WORLD A GREAT DEAL SO TAKEN PART IN OLYMPIC GAMES HERSELF
I KNOW I AND I HAPPY I DID IAN TAKING MY OWN WELL ACTUALLY CURRENTLY UP THEIR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND THEN I'M HONOURED IT'S TAKING PLACE
MIND YOU THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THAT
I THINK YOU KNOW I'M YOUR DAD HAVING INFORMATION BELTED BARNUM HOW MANY I THINK THE BASIS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
I'M AT THE OLYMPICS FOR THEM WHAT THE OLYMPICS TO BE CHANGED YET THEY HAVE THE RIGHT IT'S A KNOCK I DON'T WANT IT BUT I HAVEN'T TAKEN IT HAD BEEN BLUFFING IF YOU THE END IS THAT THEY ARE COMPATIBLE THEY MIGHT CONSIDER IT BUT IN PORLOCK OLYMPICS REALLY YOU SHOULD BE YOU CRACK ME UP OR ADDED OR A WHILE YOU
RIGHT SO IF THE DIFF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION AT THIS LATE STAGE SAID WILL WE HAD ANOTHER LOOK AT IT WE THINK MAYBE IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE NOT TO GO TO RIO THEN THEY WOULD HONOUR THAT I LIKE
BACK IN FEBRUARY
THEY RECOMMENDED A COUPLE ARE YOU THAT'S NOT A PROTECTION AGAINST WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CAN'T BUT THE THING IS THAT'S REALLY NICE I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE DURING THAT
FOR ALL THAT I THINK IF I WAS PUTTING ON OUR TEAM AND I'LL SUPPORT ARE IN RED AND YOU NEW EVIDENCE
RIGHT THEN I'LL BE HAPPY AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE THINKING ABOUT THEM NOW AND A FINAL QUICK GOOD FROM YOU AS A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SMITH AS A VIROLOGIST YOUR ADVICE WOULD BE AT LEAST THINK AGAIN AM I RIGHT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO CATCH THE SEEKER WON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'VE HAD IT TWENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE WILL GET TRIVIAL SYMPTOMS AND THERE'S ALWAYS A SMALL MINORITY WITH ANY INFECTION THAT GET SEVERE MANIFESTATIONS BUT THE WORRY HERE IS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CATCHING SOMETHING THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'VE HAD THEY THEREFORE TEND TO BREED COMPLACENCY AND SO IF GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE BEEN THERE
COME HOME TO OTHER COUNTRIES WE KNOW THAT THIS VIRUS APPEARS TO STAY IN THE BODY FOR MANY MONTHS IN CERTAIN BODY FLUIDS AND IT IS THEREFORE POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE A A THREAT I'LL POSE A THREAT TO THEIR WIVES AND PARTNERS IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM PREGNANT BY OWEN WHAT HE WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT
THINK AGAIN DOCTOR SMITH HEATHER FELL KNICKER ALEXANDER THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THE TIME FORTY MINUTES TO NINE QUICK LOOK AT THE PAPERS ENOUGH OF EUROPE LIES SAYS THE MIRROR AFTER THE TREASURY COMMITTEE YESTERDAY CRITICISED BOTH SIDES THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN EVER THEIR CLAIMS IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE THE PAPER SAYS POLITICIANS CAN BE FORGIVEN FOR MAKING MISTAKES OF THEIR CORRECT THOSE BLUNDERS WHAT VOTERS SHOULD NEVER TOLERATE IS CALCULATED DECEPTION THE GUARDIAN WOULD LIKE THEIR CAMPAIGNS TO SHOW MORE RESPECT FOR BOTH FACTS
VOTERS THE PAPERS JUST BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN RECKLESS BUT PARTICULARLY THE LEAF SIDE WITH ITS CLAIM THAT BRITAIN SENDS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS A WEEK TO THE E.U. IN THE TELEGRAPH THE FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY LORD OWEN SAYS THE REMAIN CIDER RIGGING THE REFERENDUM HE ACCUSES DAVID CAMERON OF USING THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT TO BULLY THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND HE SURPRISED NO CIVIL SERVANT HE'S RESIGNED IN PROTEST THEIR LEAD IN THE DAILY MAIL SAYS PENSIONS EXPERTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED TO BRUSSELS DIRECTIVE COST PENSIONERS DRAMATIC SUMS OF MONEY SAYS THE WARNING FLIES IN THE FACE OF
GEORGE OSBORNE'S CLAIM BRECHT'S IT COST PENSIONERS UP THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PAPERS AS A DIRECTIVE ONLY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED IN BRITAIN HAS ALREADY DRIVEN DOWN THE RATES ON ANNUITIES CALLED EXPRESS SENIOR FIGURES LEADING THE FIGHT TO GET BRITAIN OUT OF THE YOU HAVE CALLED ON BORIS JOHNSON AND FURROWS TO LINK UP AND BECOME A DREAM TEAM SO THERE ARE PLANS FOR A GREAT BRITAIN RALLY WHERE THE YOU COULD BE ON THE FORMER MAYOR OF LONDON WILL BE JOINED BY A SENIOR LABOUR FIGURE
FINANCIAL TIMES FORESEES INSTABILITY OF BRITAIN WANTS TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE LITTLE ONE HUNDRED SAYS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AIDS NOW RANK BORIS JOHNSON NEXT TO FRANCE'S NATIONAL FRONT LEADER MARINE LE PEN AND A HORROR SCENARIO A VICTORIOUS POPULISM
TIMES THIRTY MINUTES TO NINE A REVOLUTIONARY TYPE OF FOOD DELIVERY TRUCK TAKES TO THE STREETS TODAY IT'S ON TRIAL WITH SAINSBURY'S IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER FOOD LORRY BUT IT'S COOLED NOT FIND THESE DIESEL THE NORMAL FEEL BUT BY LIQUID NITROGEN WHICH IS STORED IN TANKS AT MINUS TWO HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS ONE OF MANY NEW INVENTIONS WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE COLD ECONOMY AS OUR ENVIRONMENT ANALYST ROGER HARRIMAN REPORTS
I'M IN AN INDUSTRIAL UNIT MIA TOWER IN WALES THAT EXCRUCIATING SQUEAK GIVES A CLUE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE HERE THEY CUTTING FOAM INSULATION STRIPS
TO INSULATE FRIDGES NOT ORDINARY FRIDGES BUT FRIDGES BUT RUN WITHOUT ELECTRICITY LOT OF A PRE DRILL THESE TWO HOLES
THEY LOOK LIKE REGULAR FRIDGES BUT WHEN THEY'RE BEING ASSEMBLED YOU CAN SEE A HOLLOW PLASTIC SLEEVE ROUND THE FOOD COMPARTMENT THAT SLEEVE HE'S MADE TO HOLD WATER ELECTRICITY IS USED TO FREEZE THE WATER
THEN THE ICE WILL CALLED FOOD WITH NO NEED OF POWER FOR DAYS OR WEEKS DEPENDING ON THE MODEL
THE FIRST ICE CHILLED FRIDGE IS A VACCINES COOLER THE FIRM IS SURE CHILL THE CHAIRMAN PETER SAUNDERS
WE'RE REALLY VERY VERY EXCITED BIGGEST CUSTOMERS UNICEF THE UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN'S CHARITY AND THE VACCINE REFRIGERATORS BEEN ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
WE MANUFACTURE INDIA AND IN SOUTH AFRICA AND LOOKING TO MANUFACTURE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD
THEIR NEXT PRODUCT IS A COMMERCIAL DRINKS FRIDGE COOLED BY A SOLAR PANEL IDEAL FOR COUNTRIES WHERE RISING TEMPERATURES AND INCOMES ARE PUSHING DEMAND FOR COOLING THEN FOLLOWS THE ICE COOL TO DOMESTIC FRIDGE USEFUL IN PLACES WITH INTERMITTENT POWER ALSO USEFUL FOR OPERATING SMART GRIDS WHERE YOUR APPLIANCES CAN USE ELECTRICITY WHEN ITS CHEAPEST AT NIGHT TIME RATHER THAN WHEN IT'S MOST EXPENSIVE AT TEATIME EACH FRIDGE WOULD BE ITS OWN LITTLE ENERGY STORE
PROFESSOR MARTIN FREER FROM BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY ESTIMATES THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COOLING LIKE THIS WILL RISE TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUNDS A YEAR IN COMING DECADES
THE SIZE OF THE ENERGY CHALLENGE ASSOCIATED WITH COLD AND COOLING INTERNATIONALLY IS COLOSSAL IT IS BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CURRENT CENTURY
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE EARTH
IN TERMS OF ENERGY AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN A LOCALE
NEAR COVENTRY SAINSBURY'S ARE TRIALLING A RADICALLY NEW CHILLER
NORMALLY CHILLER COMPARTMENTS RUN ON DIRTY DIESEL THAT THIS ONE EMITS NO HARMFUL GASES
IT'S CALLED BY A TANK OF LIQUID NITROGEN AT MINUS TWO HUNDRED CELSIUS
THE NITROGEN DOESN'T JUST CHILL THE FOOD WITH ITS OWN COLDNESS IT'S ALSO USED IN AN INNOVATIVE ENGINE WHICH CAPTURES THE ENERGY AS THE LIQUID EXPANDS INTO A GAS
EXPAND SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES IT TURNS INTO A GAS AND YOU CAN USE THAT TO PRODUCE SHARP OUT WHICH WE CAN USE TO MAKE ELECTRICITY BUT IT SOUNDS REVOLUTIONARY WELL WE THINK IT IS
MICHAEL SAYS HIS FERNS CALLED POWERED ENGINE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE U.K. GOOD EXPERTS WANT MINISTERS TO GO FURTHER
THEY SAY WHEN COMPRESSED LIQUID NATURAL GAS IS IMPORTED INTO BRITAIN A LOT OF ENERGY IS LOST AS IT EXPANDS BACK INTO A GAS
THEY SAY A SMART POLICY WOULD BE TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH COLDNESS COULD BE TRADED AS A COMMODITY THERE CALLED ECONOMY YOU'LL HEAR MORE OF IT

INSPIRED BY THE WAY THAT HE BUILT SPORTS HE PUT SOMEBODY'S PULLED THE SYLLABLES OF WORDS APART AND REBUILT THEM COMBINED THEM AND WE CAN SEE CHILDREN DOING THAT IN THEIR OWN ON WRITING SO THAT'S SO YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
BOOKS OBVIOUSLY DICTIONARIES WRONG THAT WE MUST BROS MUST BE SHOT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY YES AND I THINK WELL THAT'S FASCINATING THANKS VERY MUCH FOR TALKING ABOUT THE AUTHOR OF THE OXFORD ROALD DAHL DICTIONARY DOCTOR SUSAN READY
FOUR MINUTES TO NINE THERE WAS AN ECONOMICS ARTICLE PUBLISHED THIS WEEK ENTITLED NEAR LIBERALISM OVERSOLD QUESTION MARK THE IDEA THAT AUSTERITY AND GLOBALISATION AND THE WHOLE DIRECTION OF MODERN CAPITALISM IS WRONG HE'S NOT OF COURSE A CONTROVERSIAL ONE ON THE LEFT IT'S WIDELY FELT AND ON THE RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE RISE OF DONALD TRUMP BUT THIS PIECE
WAS IN THE MAGAZINE OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND WHICH IS OF COURSE THE PLACE THAT NEO LIBERALISM HAS BEEN MOST CHAMPIONED THE F. TWO YOU REPORTS THIS MORNING THAT IT LEFT ECONOMISTS WONDERING WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON SO WHAT IS GOING ON WE'RE JOINED BY LIAM BYRNE FORMER TREASURY MINISTER WHO HAS JUST WRITTEN A BOOK ENTITLED DRAGONS TEN ENTREPRENEURS WHO BUILT BRITAIN AND IS IN A SHEFFIELD STUDIO MORNING TO YOU MORNING DO YOU ACCEPT THAT CAPITALISM AS CURRENTLY PRACTISED IN THE WESTERN WORLD
HE'S IN DEEP DEEP TROUBLE OR TWO I THINK THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF GLOBALISATION HAVE CREATED THIS WORLD OF VERY VERY RICH ELITES AND VERY VERY REMOTE ELITES AND WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT YOU'VE GOT THESE MEGA CORPORATIONS BIGGER THAN COUNTRIES DOMINATING THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS OF THE BRITISH ECONOMY OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND OF COURSE THEY'RE DRIVING DOWN WAGES THEY'RE PAYING THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP A GREAT DEAL BUT CRUCIALLY THEY'RE NOT INVESTING IN THEIR NEW IDEAS AND NEW INDUSTRIES AND NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE
ALL OF THEM ARE SITTING ON CASH AND THEY'RE FAILING TO UNLOCK THE GREAT POTENTIAL THAT TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PRODUCTIVITY IS ACTUALLY STALLING AND OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT LIVING STANDARDS AROUND THE WORLD A FLAN THERE WHAT HISTORY TEACHES US IS THAT THERE'S AN ANSWER ARMY ANSWER IS ENTREPRENEURS
WHAT WHICH IS THAT SUBDUE HER BUT CONVENIENTLY ENOUGH BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL YES BUT IT FEELS LIKE A VERY VERY
SMALL SCALE SOLUTION TO A HUGE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WELL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT BEFORE I FINISH THIS BOOK AND THIS BOOK IS THE STORY OF BRITISH CAPITALISM TOLD THROUGH THE LIGHT OF TEN ENTREPRENEURS FROM DICK WHITTINGTON TO JOHN SPEED AND LOUIS SO IT'S NOT QUITE HORRIBLE HISTORIES MEETS THE APPRENTICE BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF DRAMA AND LOTS OF UPS AND DOWNS BUT THE MESSAGE IS VERY SIMPLE ENTREPRENEURS MAKE HISTORY BY INVENTING THE FUTURE
AND WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS A WORLD PARTICULARLY HERE IN THE WEST PARTICULARLY IN BRITAIN IS WE NEED THE KIND OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SURGE THAT CREATED BRITISH CAPITALISM OVER THE LAST SIX HUNDRED YEARS
TO CREATE NEW JOBS WE NEED NEW IDEAS TURNED INTO NEW INDUSTRIES AND NEW INDUSTRIES TURNED OUT ALSO MEANS BREAKING UP THE STRUCTURES THAT KEEP THEM DOWN DOESN'T IT IT DOES A TASK WELL IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T EXPECT TO COME OUT SO CLEARLY IS THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS SO THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT ENTREPRENEURS ARE THE HEROIC INDIVIDUAL STRUGGLING AGAINST THE ODDS MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN
ACTUALLY HE'S SHOWS THAT'S NOT TRUE GREAT ENTREPRENEURS DO WELL WHEN THEY'RE A STRONG INSTITUTIONS DOWN THE AGES THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BRITISH MIRACLE WITHOUT THE ROYAL EXCHANGE WHERE WE SWAPPED MONEY AND IDEAS WITHOUT THE ROYAL NAVY WITHOUT THE ROYAL SOCIETY THAT DROVE FORWARD BRITISH SCIENCE WITHOUT THE ROYAL MEANT INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BIG ARGUMENT THAT SAYS
THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN THE WORLD WHETHER IT IS THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHETHER IT'S OUR FISCAL POLICY WHETHER IT'S OUR SCIENCE POLICY UNIVERSES THERE'S A BIG AUDIENCE AND ACTUALLY THE RULES OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE WRONG RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH FATHER TO COPE WITH GLOBAL CAPITAL WITH A MORE POWERFUL EXACTLY THEY'RE NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH BUT ALSO THEY'RE NOT TURNING IDEAS INTO INTO ECONOMIC ACTION FAST ENOUGH THEY'RE NOT TRAINING THE RIGHT KINDS OF PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THEY'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE AT THE TOP TOO
WALK AWAY WITH THE FRUITS OF GROWTH WHILE EVERYONE ELSE FRANKLY HAS A PRETTY HARD TIME OF IT SO THERE ARE ECONOMISTS NOW MUCH THE GLITZ
AND SAYING THAT ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS OF REWRITING THE RULES OF OUR INSTITUTIONS RIGHT THERE AND ACTUALLY WHAT THE HISTORY OF DRAGON SHOWS IS THAT UNLESS YOU DO THAT ACTUALLY YOU'RE ON ENTREPRENEUR ACTIVITY WILL SLOW AND YOU'D HAVE BEEN IN TEN SECONDS HOW REALISTIC IS IT THAT WE WILL MANAGE TO DO THAT
I THINK IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER TO TAKE THESE CHOICES LET'S REJECT IDEAS LIKE LEAVING EUROPEAN UNION OR ELECTING DONALD TRUMP LET'S ACTUALLY JUST FOCUS ON WHAT HISTORY TELLS US WORKS AND THAT'S GETTING BEHIND ENTERPRISE LIAM BYRNE FORMER TREASURY MINISTER DRAGONS TEN ENTREPRENEURS WHO BUILT BRITAIN IS THE BOOK THANKS EDITORS LOUISA LEWIS UNCOVERS GIGA BORING
