A DRAFT BILL PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER WAS THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE SCRUTINY BY THREE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES THEY WERE CONCERNED THE PROPOSALS LACKED CLARITY AND COULD BE TOO INTRUSIVE
THE RESULT ACCORDING TO THE HOME OFFICE IS A BILL WHICH NOW CONTAINS TIGHTER TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS CODES OF PRACTICE SETTING OUT HOW THE POWERS WILL BE USED AND STRONGER CONTROL TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRIVACY BUT THE LATEST MEASURES ALSO GO FURTHER THAN THE DRAFT BILL BY ALLOWING POLICE WHO ARE PURSUING INVESTIGATIVE LEADS TO SEE WHICH WEBSITE SOMEONE HAS ACCESS

CHARLOTTE GALLAGHER REPORTING THERE THE TIME IS SIX MINUTES PAST SIX AND JOHN HAMMOND IS AT THE B.B.C. WEATHER CENTRE MORNING JOHN JOHN WELL THE COLD WEATHER WILL SOON BE BACK BUT IT'S A MUCH SMALLER START TO THE DAY THIS MORNING FOR MOST OF US MILD BUT PRETTY WET FOR MANY AS WELL
FOR ENGLAND AND WALES A DAMPENED DRAB STARTS THE HEAVIEST RAIN THE MOAT ACROSS NORTHWESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND NORTH WEST WALES BUT THE RAIN WILL SWEEP DOWN ACROSS THE WHOLE OF ENGLAND AND WALES THROUGH TODAY SOME PRETTY WET WEATHER WON'T HANG AROUND MIND YOU IT'LL BE CLEARING THE SOUTHEAST SOON AFTER LUNCH SO
DRY WEATHER LATER ON TODAY FOR MOST OF ENGLAND AND WALES SOME BRIGHTNESS THOUGH NOT A LOT OF FAIR BIT OF CLOUD AND FURTHER SHOUTY PACKING INTO NORTHWESTERN PARTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES LATER ON BY WHICH TIME TEMPERATURES HERE WERE A SETTLED TO AROUND ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT DEGREES BUT FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES I COMPARE WITH RECENTLY IT WILL BE MILD TEN TO TWELVE DEGREES TYPICALLY THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON
FOR SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND IT'S ALREADY DRYING UP HERE THE BEST OF THE SUNSHINE TODAY WILL BE ACROSS THE MORE SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF BOTH SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND TO BRISK OLD WINDOW AND THAT WIND WILL FEED SHOWERS INTO WESTERN SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND LATER ON TODAY AND THEY'LL BEGIN TO TURN WINTRY AGAIN UP OVER THE HIGH GROUND
BY THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT DEGREES TYPICALLY CAUGHT MORE THAN LONDON SCOTLAND BUT IT WILL BE TURNING COLDER THROUGH THIS EVENING ONE BAND OF SHOWERS HEAD SOUTH EASTWARDS THROUGH ENGLAND AND WALES FOLLOWING ON MUCH COLDER AIR FOR ALL OF US FREQUENT WINTRY SHOWERS FOR NORTHERN BRITAIN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT ICE AND SNOW HERE DOWN TO QUITE LOW LEVELS AND THAT WINTRY THEME CONTINUES THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK I'LL BE BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS SEVEN MINUTES PAST SIX LET'S HAVE A FIRST LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS FOR THE TIMES THE MAIN STORY IS WHAT IT CALLS THE N.H.S. BEGINNING URBAN PLANNING FOR THE FIRST TIME A PLAN FOR HEALTHY TOWNS WOULD HOUSE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED COUNCILS AND DEVELOPERS HAVE APPLIED FOR N.H.S. OR HELP UNDER A SCHEME LAUNCHED BY SIMON STEPHENS AHEAD OF N.H.S. ENGLAND THE IDEA IS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO BE MODERN VERSIONS OF EDWARDIAN GARDEN CITIES
DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT CAN IMPROVE HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE ADVENTURE PLAYGROUNDS BEING A STANDARD FEATURE OF STREET DESIGNS TO MAKE WALKING MORE FUN FOR CHILDREN FAST FOOD FREE ZONES AND VIRTUAL CARE HOME SO YOU WOULD BUILD HOUSES THAT WOULD BE CONNECTED BY WHY FIVE ALLOWING ELDERLY RESIDENTS TO SPEAK TO CARERS AND TO AND TO ONE ANOTHER DETAILED PLANS OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE EXPECTED WITHIN SIX MONTHS TELEGRAPH LEAD TO THE STORY THAT SAYS DAVID CAMERON'S GOING TO CULL THE HUNDREDS
TORY ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND STRIP LOCAL CHAIRMAN OF THEIR POWERS UNDER PLANS TO REIN IN THE CONSERVATIVE GRASSROOTS UP TO NINETY PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY CONSERVATIVE ASSOCIATIONS COULD BE AXED AND OF THE BIGGEST REFORMS FOR THE PARTY STRUCTURE IN EIGHTEEN YEARS
ARGENTINA IS GOING TO RETURN TO INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET THIS IS THE LEAD STORY FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES IT HASN'T GOT MUCH ATTENTION SO FAR BUT ESSENTIALLY THE END OF A FIFTEEN YEAR BATTLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA HAD WITH HER CREDITORS INCLUDING TWO IMPORTANT HEDGE FUNDS THE END OF OF THAT AND AGREEMENT WITH THOSE CREDITORS MEANS THAT THE COUNTRY CAN NOW GO BACK INTO THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS DURING THE FIFTEEN YEAR LEGAL BATTLES
THE F. T. V. CREDITORS ATTEMPTED TO EMBARGO EVERYTHING FROM NAVY FRIGATES TO SATELLITE LAUNCHES TO CLAW BACK THE MONEY THAT A NEW YORK COURT SAID THEY WERE OWED FROM DEFAULTED BONDS BUT THIS AGREEMENT IS A VICTORY FOR THE NEW ARGENTINE PRESIDENT WHO MADE ENDING THE LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST THESE FARMS ONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES
THERE'S A DEEPLY DISTURBING PICTURE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT A YACHT WENT MISSING ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE MAN WHO WAS YACHT IT WAS MANFRED BEDROOM DISAPPEARED WITH THE YACHT WILL NOW THE YACHT'S BEEN FOUND WRECKED AND THERE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF MY VERSION OF THAT
SLUMPED OVER HIS DESK HE HAS BEEN DEAD FOR A YEAR AND HIS BODY IS SORT OF MUMMIFIED IN A WAY AND YOU DO WONDER WHETHER IT WAS NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT PICTURE IN THE MOUNDS IN TOTAL A BIT OF DIGNITY IN HIS DEATH YOU MIGHT THINK BUT THERE WE ARE
THE TIME IS NOW TEN PAST SIX PUPILS IN ENGLAND FIND OUT TODAY WHICH SECONDARY SCHOOL THEY HAVE GOT INTO WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO MISS OUT ON THEIR FIRST CHOICE OUR EDUCATION CORRESPONDENT ROBERT PIGGOTT IS ON THE LINE AND THIS ASSESSMENT OF THEIR NUMBERS ROBERT BASED ON THE FIGURES FOR LAST YEAR
YES EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN DIDN'T GET THEIR FIRST CHOICE THE SECONDARY SCHOOL LAST YEAR THAT WAS THE SEVEN THOUSAND DROP ON THE YEAR BEFORE AND THE REASON FOR CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS THIS BULGING POPULATION IN CHILDREN IN PRIMUS IT'S JUST REACHING SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND IT WILL INTENSIFY THE COMPETITION FOOT FOR THE MOST POPULAR SCHOOLS OR MEAN THAT SOME PEOPLE'S WON'T GET INTO THOSE SCHOOLS THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT
EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF PUPILS DID GET THEIR FIRST CHOICE LAST YEAR IN NINETY FIVE PER CENT GOT ONE OF THEIR FIRST THREE CHOICES SO IT DEPENDS HOW YOU LOOK AT THE STATS BUT I THINK THE BACKGROUND IS THIS INCREASING PRESSURE ON THOSE MOST POPULAR SCHOOLS ONE IN SIX ROUGHLY BEING OVER SUBSCRIBED AND IN LONDON TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOLS OVER SUBSCRIBED RISING TO EIGHTY PER CENT IN SOME BOROUGHS SO PATCHY ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR PARENTS WHO DO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION WHERE THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED WHEN WHEN THESE LETTERS COME THROUGH
IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING AND THE PRESSURE IS INCREASING ON PARENTS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE FOR FOR CHILDREN THEN IT'S LED TO A LOT OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS OFTEN FALSE ADDRESSES BEING GIVEN PARENTS SOMETIMES RENTING PROPERTY INSIDE CATCHMENT AREAS GIVING THE ADDRESSES OF GRANDPARENTS ALL RELATIVES AND SO ON AND THERE'S BEEN QUITE A HARDENING LINE ON THAT HUNDREDS OF PLACES WITHDRAWN EACH YEAR SOMETIMES AFTER CHILDREN HAVE STARTED THEIR PARENTS ARE INCREASINGLY READY TO USE THEIR RIGHT OF APPEAL PIT PARENTS CAN APPEAL
THERE ARE FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND APPEALS LAST YEAR ABOUT A FIFTH OF THEM WERE SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT AGAIN IS PATCHY IN SOME AREAS THAT FALLS TO SOMETHING LIKE THREE PER CENT SO IT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT PROCESS AND A DIFFICULT INTENSE TIME OF YEAR FOR PARENTS WHO ARE LOOKING VERY NERVOUSLY AT WHERE THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT IF SOME OF THE APPEALS ARE SUCCESSFUL WHAT ARE THE MOST LIKELY HAVE ON ON WHICH THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY DOES END UP BEING AN AN AVENUE THAT OPENS UP THAT WASN'T
WHEN THE CHILD FIRST APPLIED WHERE THEY CAN BE THINGS LIKE A CHILD HAVING A SIBLING AT HER SCHOOL THAT NORMALLY GETS THEM IN BUT IT WON'T ALWAYS IF THERE ARE LOOKED AFTER OR PREVIOUSLY LOOKED AFTER CHILD IN FOSTER GET THAT SORT OF THING IF THEY HAVE A STATEMENT OF SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS THAT WILL RAISE THEM UP THE THE LIST OF THE PECKING ORDER AND THEN THERE'S ISSUES TO DO WITH DISTANCE AND SO ON THESE ARE ALL
THE NORMAL CRITERIA SOMETIMES PARENTS CAN MAKE A CLAIM THAT THEIR CHILD WILL SUFFER UNDULY BY NOT GOING TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL BECAUSE OF SOME EMOTIONAL OR RATHER NEED AND SO OCCASIONALLY THEY'LL GET THROUGH THAT WAY ROBERT PIGGOTT THANK YOU
THIRTEEN MINUTES PAST SIX A WARNING HAS BEEN SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION DRASTICALLY OR FACE LEGAL ACTION WILL A ENVIRONMENT THAT IS ROGER HAD A BIN THIS IS FROM THE SUPREME COURT ROGER WHAT'S THE CHARGE AS IT WERE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND WELL LAST YEAR AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CHARITY CLIENT TOOK A CASE AGAINST GOVERNMENT SAYING THAT THEY JUST WEREN'T ACTING QUICKLY ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD PEOPLE'S HEALTH I THINK IT'S NOW BROADLY AGREED THAT
BAD AIR IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WITH AROUND FORTY THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS IN THE U.K. ALONE AND DIPPED THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE THE CASE WAS FAIR FROM THE ENVIRONMENT GROUP AND THEY INSTRUCTED THE GOVERNMENT TO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PRODUCED PLANS THAT WOULD SHOW WHETHER THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY OR NOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DID PRODUCE THEIR PLANS
BUT NOW THE CHARITY CLIENT EARTH IS LOOKED AT THOSE PLANS AGAIN AND SAYS IT STILL DOESN'T BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING ENOUGH SO IT'S GIVEN IT TEN DAY WARNING THAT IT DOESN'T DO MORE IN THE NEXT TEN DAYS IT WILL TAKE IT BACK TO COURT AGAIN AND DO WHAT WHAT WHAT POWER DOES THE COURT HAVE TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING WHICH ADMITTEDLY IS DIFFICULT
WELL THE COURT THE GOVERNMENT IS CLEARLY IN BREACH OF EUROPEAN LAW I HAVE TO SAY THE U.K. IS NOT ALONE IN THIS MOST COUNTRIES ARE IN BREACH OF U.K. LAW ON THIS ISSUE AT WHAT THE GROUP IS SAYING CLIENT EARTH IS SAYING IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT REALLY WANTED TO TACKLE THIS SERIOUSLY FIRST OF ALL THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SLACKERS OTHER GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN OVER THE DIESELS ISSUE WITH CARS AND
AND TESTING OF DIESEL VEHICLES BUT THEY SHOULD NOW BE IMPOSING LIMITS ON CITIES SO IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE INTO A CITY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR HYDROGEN VEHICLE AT LEAST A HYBRID VEHICLE AND THAT DIRTY DIESELS IN TERMS OF TRUCKS AND DUSTBIN LORRIES AND BUSES SHOULD ALL BE PHASED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IT'S NOT BEING DONE QUICKLY AND ROGER JUST IN A SENSITIVE IF YOU WOULD IF THEY DON'T DO IT WHAT CAROL
SUPREME COURT TO CARTER IN THE GOVERNMENT TO DRILL THE HOLE OR FIND A MOULD I MEAN WHAT CAN I DO IT ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO THE HIGH COURT AGAIN AND THE HIGH COURT AT THE SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT THE HIGH COURT CAN TELL THE GOVERNMENT WHAT TO DO AND IF THEY DON'T DO IT IT WERE TO GET EXPECTANCY WELL BUT THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT IN THE END THERE'S NO I'M WHAT'S THE POINT WHAT THESE WILL PROCESS IT IS IT IS EUROPEAN LAW JOHN SO YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS HOW FAR THE COMMISSION WANTS TO PUSH IT
ROGER THANKS A LOT THAT I'M HIS QUARTER PAST SIX BARCLAYS' ANNUAL RESULTS ARE RELEASED THIS MORNING WE'LL FIND OUT THEN IF THEY'LL FARE ANY BETTER THAT OBVIOUS DID LAST WEEK AND JOE'S ALREADY LOOKING INTO THIS MORNING GOOD MORNING TO YOU MICHELLE YEAH THIS WILL BE THE FIRST MAJOR RESULTS SINCE THE PREVIOUS BARCLAYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE ANTONY JENKINS WAS DEFENESTRATED LAST YEAR LIKE MANY BANKS BARCLAYS SHARES HAVE HAD A TORRID FEW MONTHS AS INVESTORS FEAR A CHINESE SLOW DOWN ANY NEW GLOBAL RECESSION
SO WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM BARCLAYS WHO MAY HAVE TO SHELL OUT MORE MONEY FOR FINES AND PUNISHMENTS ARE SPECIALLY P.P.I. WITH ME IS PETER THE NEW PROFESSOR OF BANKING AT THE INSTITUTE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES FORMERLY OF CASS FORMERLY OF THE F. F. F. F. ESSAY AND FORMALLY OF THE BANK OF BEING YOU'VE GOT A BUSY SEA V. PETER GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE WE EXPECTED TO HEAR WHEN THE RESULTS COME OUT AT JUST AFTER SEVEN WELL BERKELEY'S TELEGRAPH QUAIL
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SO THEY'LL BE A P.P.I. TOUR EGGS HOW MUCH PROBABLY THE OLD IT'S OVER A MILLION POUNDS POTENTIALLY I WOULD SAY IT LOOKS THAT WAY
THEY AND THEIR ANNOUNCED HAS TO WORRY IT'S BEEN LEAKED TO THE PRESS SOMEHOW IT'S GOT NOWT STRATEGIC REVIEW OF AFRICA HOLDINGS I THINK
BASICALLY TRY AND STRENGTHEN PARTS OF THEIR U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS WHICH IS O.K. WITH HER O.K. I THINK IT WILL BE IN THE U.K. INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS EUROPEAN PROBABLY LESS ASIA LESS SO SO PULL IN THE ANTLERS A LITTLE BIT FROM ASIA AND I DEFINITELY DON'T YOU THINK GOING TO PULL IN THE ATLAS FROM AFRICA WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR PART OF THEIR BUSINESS FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES YES I THINK
BARCLAYS TOOK A STRATEGIC MOVE TO INCREASE THAT WHEN AFRICA LOOK LIKE IT WAS A BIG SIX LONG TERM SUCCESS I THINK THERE'S MORE QUESTIONS I'VE GOT ROUND COMMODITY PRICES TODAY SO IT IT IN HIGH INSIDE IT LOOKS LIKE BIKE WE SHOULD HAVE KEPT ITS BIG U.S. INVESTMENT
MANAGEMENT AND SOLD AFRICA INSTEAD OF THE REVERSE SO YOU THINK THEN WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON THE RETAIL SIDE ON THE HIGH STREET BANKING SITE VERY U.K. FOCUSED BUT ON THE INVESTMENT BANKING SIDE MORE AND NORTH AMERICA FOCUS YES THE WEIGHT'S GOING TO BE THERE AND I THINK THAT ALSO LONG TERM WILL GIVE BARCLAYS A BETTER OPTION OF WHETHER HE WANTS TO HAVE A LONG AND SEPARATE THE U.S. BUSINESS AS A STENCIL
SO HAVING BOUGHT LEHMAN BROTHERS AT THE HEIGHT OF QUESTION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THEY MIGHT KIND OF HIDE IT OFF AS A BARCLAYS DIVISION AT SOME STAGE IN THE FUTURE YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY THE NEW LEHMAN COULD RISE AGAIN BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT NAME WOULD ATTRACT THE NAME WHAT WOULD BE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION DOLLARS
WHAT WILL CHANGE DO YOU THINK I WHAT WOULD WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM JESS DALEY THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BARCLAYS WELL I THINK FOR ALL LARGE BANKS TODAY INVESTORS ARE PRETTY KEEN IRON FEWER PRODUCTS
BETTER HEARING BETTER SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS AND DOING THEM ALL MORE EFFICIENTLY CUTTING COSTS THAT MEANS JOBS OFF OF ATLAS JOBS AND THAT'S GONNA LEAD TO
DIVOT HATS BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT AWAY AT THE TURN OF THE WAS THE DIVIDEND HE'LL INVESTORS GET WOOD POSSIBLY WON'T BE TOUCHED TODAY AND THAT'S SENDING A SIGNAL THAT WE REALLY KEVIN INVESTMENT YES I THINK THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT HOW BARCLAYS CAPITAL RATIOS FOR REGULAR TORY CAPITAL RATIOS WERE ACCOUNT THE
IF WARWICK LISA NEEDS TO RAISE ITS ITS EQUITY FOR REGULAR TWENTY CAPITAL IT'S GOT A CHOICE YOU CAN IN THE LONG RUN DO WORSE ISSUE MORE SHARES THEY CAN CUT IT IF I DON'T THOSE OF FIESTA OR WAYS TO RAISE EQUITY SO
WATCH OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT A DIVOT IN AND OUT OF THE RIVER OVER THE HABIT AND THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE AS I SAID DEFENESTRATED ANTHONY JACKETS MAKE A HALF A MILLION POUNDS BONUS TO SPICE
BEING FIRED YES IT WAS A PECULIAR STATEMENT WHEN THEY FIRED WASN'T IT WASN'T IT HE DID A BAD JOB IT WAS THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB I NEVER MOVED IN AS THAT'S ALL YOU'RE DOING THAT YES BUT IT'S IT IS UNUSUAL TO SEE SOMEONE GETTING FIRED
GETTING A BONUS AND THAT MIGHT STOKE UP COMPLAINTS AGAINST BUT THE BANKING FOR CHARITY THANKS FOR NOW PETER HAND LET ME BRING IMPRESSIVE PERSONAL STALLION FROM PICKED ASSET MANAGEMENT ON THIS BARCLAYS ISSUE SHARES DOWN A THIRD OVER THE LAST
SIX TO NINE MONTHS CAN YOU SEE THEM RECOVERING HIS IS THE BAG NOW KIND OF A PLATEAU ING OUT THERE CERTAINLY VERY CHEAP AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BANK ON ARE PRICED BOOK VALUE BASIS IT'S ONE OF THE CHEAPEST IN THE SECTOR I THINK CRITICALLY THOUGH INVESTORS ARE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A CREDIBLE PLAN FOR THE INVESTMENT BANKERS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE THEY CAPITAL POSITION CAN BE SHORED UP THROUGH PERHAPS SALE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN SUBSIDIARY WHICH WOULD THEN MEAN THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR A FURTHER EQUITY ASSURANCE WOULD BE OFF THE TABLE THOSE WITH THE SIGNALS TO COME OUT TODAY WHICH COULD SEE BARKER'S SHOWS DOING VERY WELL LET'S MOVE TO VOLKSWAGEN BE CHIEF EXECUTIVE MIGHTIEST MILLER HE'S BEEN TALKING TO THE B. B. C. ABOUT THEIR MISSIONS SCANDAL HE'S AT THE AT THE MOTOR SHOW IN GENEVA AND HOW MUCH YOU MIGHT END UP COSTING THE COMPANY
IT'S A MIX MY OWN SINK THIS IS FIRST OF ALL THE SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION IS THE REALITY WE'VE POSTPONED OUR YEAR END FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE A.G.M. TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN BE EVEN MORE CONFIDENT AND TAKE EVEN MORE CARE AND DILIGENCE AND ESTABLISHING THE FIGURES THEN WE'LL SEE IF WE HAVE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OVER AND ABOVE THE SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION
SIX BY SEVEN IS EUROS OF COURSE DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO PUT OFF DRAW A LINE UNDER THE ISSUE FOR FOX ONE NO I THINK THAT WAS ALWAYS AN OVER OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATION OF OF WHAT THEY'D HAVE TO PAY IN THE STATES THERE BEING SUED BY THAT THESE THREE AGENCIES AND STATES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO MOST MOST PRIVATE SECTOR ANALYSTS EXPECTED THE FIGURE COULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT THERE PROBABLY HE'LL HAVE TO INCREASE PROVISIONS
BIG THE KEY THING THAT INVESTORS WILL BE LOOKING FOR US FURTHER SCIENCE THAT HE'S MANAGING TO ALTER THE CULTURE OF THE COMPANY THIS WAS A VERY MONOLITHIC VERY SECRETIVE VERY OUR ROCK COMPANY NOT PARTICULARLY SUITED TO DOING WELL WITH THE PROVIDERS OF OUTSIDE FINANCE I THINK WHAT THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR US AS SCIENCE THAT HE'S GETTING TO GRIPS WITH THAT CULTURE AND OPENING IT UP VERY BRIEFLY ARGENTINA SETTLED
WITH THEIR SO CALLED HOLD OUT BOND HOLDERS YESTERDAY IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FIFTEEN POINT SIX BILLION POUNDS FOR AN EMERGING MARKET WILL THAT DRAW A LINE OF THE ISSUE FOR THEM WERE POTENTIALLY YES IT'S ACTUALLY FOUR BIG SHAREHOLDERS THAT MOMENT BOND HOLDERS THAT THEY MANAGED TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH SO IT'S ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING
CREDITORS THE HOLD OUTS IT'S IT'S ABOUT JUST UNDER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE LOOKING TO LAUNCH A BOND OF ABOUT FIFTEEN WHICH IS FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ONE OF THEM WOULD BE IN ONE OF THE LARGEST EMERGING MARKET BOND THIS RINSES THIS YEAR BUT POTENTIAL IS VERY GOOD DEMAND FOR IT THERE'S GREAT INTEREST NOW TO TINA HAS HUGE POTENTIAL AS AN ECONOMY PERSONAL STANDING THERE FROM PICKED AN ASSET MANAGEMENT THANK YOU IF EXTRACTING COMMODITIES LIKE
COPPER ZINC AND IRON OR A PLATINUM IS YOUR BUSINESS THEN YOU'VE HAD A HELLISH TWENTY FIFTEEN AS PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS HAVE CRASHED SO TODAY'S ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE LONDON LISTER GLENCORE MIGHT BE THE CASE OF ANNA EXCUSE ME DAMAGE LIMITATION CHARLES GIBSON IS FROM THE COMPANY EDISON SECURITY'S GOOD MORNING TO YOU CHARLES GOOD MORNING WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING TO HEAR TODAY SHALL WE KIND OF
BRACE YOURSELVES I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THE BARCLAYS RESULTS HAVE BEEN WELL TELEGRAPHED I THINK ALSO GLENCORE'S HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL TELEGRAPHED BY THE BY THE COMPANY AS WELL AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVING GUIDANCE PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE THE ONE AREA OF GLENCORE WHICH ALWAYS CAUSES A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE HE DOESN'T CAUSE TROUBLE BUT IT'S THE AREA THE ANALYST REFER TO AS THE BLACK BOX WHICH IS THEIR TRADING BUSINESS THAT'S UNUSUAL IN MINING COMPANIES MINING COMPANIES PRODUCE
METAL PRODUCED MINERALS AND THEN THEY SELL THEM IN THE CASE OF GLENCORE THEY THEY TRADE THEM AS WELL SO THEY MAKE MONEY IF YOU'RE LATE THEY MAKE PROFITS IF YOU LIKE THAT I ACTING AGENT SHOULD OR YOU COULD MAKE IF YOU'RE BUYING AND SELLING YOU CAN ACT THAT'S A CASH SAUCE FOR YOU RATHER THAN A LEAD WEIGHT LIKE SOME OF THE COMMODITIES THE FALLEN IN VALUE
SAID THAT IF YOU LIKE IS AN AREA OF STABILISATION FOR THE BUSINESS AND I SUPPOSE THE POINT IS THAT LINK OR IN THIS CASE THEY HAVE INDICATED ALL THEY GUIDED THE MARKET TOWARDS A FACT IN TERMS OF Y. BIT DAH EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST TAXI APPRECIATION WHAT ISATION WE LOBBYIST REVISION YEAH ABSOLUTELY AS OPPOSED TO EARNINGS BEFORE I TRICKED THE DUMB AUDITOR WHICH IS WHAT I WANT A BANKING ANALYST SOMETHING MY COT EVEN PROFITABLE STARTED WELL OVER TYPE YES PROFITS BEFORE ALL THE COSTS OF ALL THE EXTRA COSTS
ANYWAY HE BITS ARE FROM THAT DIVISION OF ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION TWO POINT FIVE TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OUT OF A TOTAL WHICH IS EXPECTED FOR GLENCORE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR TODAY SO SO THAT'S HIM IF YOU LIKE THAT'S THE AREA OF STABILISATION WHAT THE MARKET WILL BE LOOKING FOR ON TOP OF THAT I THINK WERE CERTAINLY ANY EVIDENCE OF FURTHER COST CUTTING SYNERGIES IVAN BLAZON BURGER SUGGESTED THAT WAS A CHIEF EXEC YEAH
THE SYNERGIES COMING OUT FROM THE EXTRACTOR DEAL MUM HAVE BEEN GREATER THAN EXPECTED MEL LOOKING ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A MILLION DOLLARS SO THE MARKET WILL BE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF THAT
RIGHT DANCE AND IMPAIRMENTS MUM IS ONE AREA THEY HAVE OR WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF MINDS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT IS THAT IT WELL IN PARTICULAR YES AND PROBABLY AGAIN FROM THE EXTRA AFTER DEAL NOW WE KNOW THAT THE STRATEGY ALWAYS OF THE ORDER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
THEY'VE WRITTEN OFF SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHICH ASSETS SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THAT WERE WRITTEN DOWN BUT WE CAN ASSUME IS THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF OF OF THEM OR THERE HAS BEEN A RIGHT DOWN FOR MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE ACID WILL THERE BE ANY MORE NOW CONNIE AMBO WHICH IS A NICKEL MINING IN NEW CALEDONIA FIVE BILLION DOLLARS NOW THAT IS ONE THAT THE MARKET WILL BE LOOKING FOR VERY CLOSELY TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY FURTHER RIGHT CHARLES GIBSON THERE FROM EDISON SECURITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH

UNLOCKED THE EIFFEL OF AN ISLAMIST GUNMEN WHO SHOT DEAD FOURTEEN PEOPLE
THE AMERICAN ACTOR GEORGE KENNEDY WHO APPEARED IN COOL HAND LUKE ALONGSIDE PAUL NEWMAN HAS DIED HE WAS NINETY ONE KENNEDY ALSO STARRED IN THE DISASTER FILM EARTHQUAKE AND THE NAKED GUN SERIES BEFORE MOVING TO HOLLYWOOD HE SERVED WITH THE U.S. INFANTRY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR IN LISTING AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN DESPERATE SCENES YESTERDAY ON THE BORDER BETWEEN MACEDONIA AND GREASERS THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS TRIED TO GET ACROSS A CORRESPONDENT AT THE BORDER IS DANNY SAVAGE WHAT'S HAPPENED DURING THE NIGHT
WE'RE TRYING TO CALM DOWN A LOT YESTERDAY EVENING AND THE PROTESTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE UP AT THE BORDER GATES BASICALLY BROKE UP LACE AFTERNOON AND PEOPLE WENT OFF TO TRY AND GET SOME FOOD BUT THE QUEUE'S THERE FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS FOR FOOD AT THE MOMENT IT'S A CAMP WITH SEVEN THOUSAND MIGRANTS NOW THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE ARRIVING BY THE HOUR BY TAXI OR ON FOOT TO THE COACHES HAVE STOPPED BRINGING THEM UP FROM ATHENS SO THE NUMBERS ARE STILL BUILDING BUT I THINK THAT DURING THE DAY
TENSIONS WERE POTENTIALLY BUILD A GAME WE'VE SEEN THIS OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS NOW WHERE CROWDS START GATHERING NEAR THE BORDER GATE FROM ABOUT LATE MORNING ONWARDS WE'VE HAD CHANTING AND SHOUTING OF OPEN THE BORDER FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO AND THEN YESTERDAY A BIG THE MUCH MORE CONCERTED EFFORT AS WE SAW ON THE PITCH ISN'T HEARD ABOUT LAST NIGHT OF PEOPLE STORMING THAT MAIN BORDER GAVE THE ONE THAT RUNS ACROSS THE RAILWAY LINE
USING A METAL POLE TO PUSH IT OPEN AND THEN THE MACEDONIAN POLICE FORCE RESPONDING WITH TEAR GAS TO TRY AND DISPERSE THE CROWD TO STOP PEOPLE COMING ACROSS THE BORDER AND OF COURSE THERE ARE VAST NUMBERS IN OTHER PARTS OF SUPPRESSED ESPECIALLY ENOUGH AND OBVIOUSLY WHO MAY WELL YET END UP ON THAT BOARD ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS INTO MACEDONIA AND THEN INTO THE REST OF EUROPE
THE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MIGRANTS ARE IN GREECE AT THE MOMENT SEVEN THOUSAND OF THEM ARE AT THE BORDER SO THE STILL NINETEEN THOUSAND OTHERS NOW AFGHANS HAVE STARTED BASICALLY NOT BOTHERING GOING UP TO THE MACEDONIAN BORDER THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED ACROSS BUT THEY'RE THERE CAUSING A DIFFERENT PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY'RE MASSING IN PLACES IN ATHENS AT THE MOMENT WITH NOWHERE TO GO THERE'S NO PROSPECT OF THEM MOVING ON THE
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO MOVE ON OR HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION TO MOVE ON IF YOU LIKE OR SYRIANS IRAQIS AND IN THEY'RE IN VARIOUS HOLDING CAMPS AROUND THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT BUT ALL AIMING TO GET UP TO THAT BORDER CAMP TO GET ACROSS THE MACEDONIA TO GET OUT THE TRAIL TOWARDS GERMANY AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT'S LIKE HOW IT'S CHANGING DAY BY DAY THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE UN SAVE US ON SUNDAY
THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MIGRANTS ARRIVED IN THE ISLANDS OF GREECE ON THOSE SMALL BOATS COMING ACROSS FROM TURKEY JUST NINETY TWO MIGRANTS LEFT LEFT LEFT GREECE TO GO INTO MACEDONIA ON THE SAME DAY SO IT DOESN'T TAKE A GENIUS TO WORK OUT MATHEMATICALLY THAT EVERY DAY THERE WAS A HUGE NUMBER OF EXTRA MIGRANTS ARRIVING IN GREECE AND THE NUMBERS JUST KEEP GROWING
WE'LL RETURN TO THIS DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMME DANNY MANY THANKS THE TIME IS TWENTY FIVE TO SEVEN THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL TO BE PUBLISHED LATER TODAY A NEW VERSION OF THE LEGISLATION ORIGINALLY CALLED THE SNOOPERS CHARTER BY ITS CRITICS OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE IS ON THE LINE HOW CLOSE IS THIS DANNY TO WHAT THE HOME SECRETARY PUT FORWARD IN THE AUTUMN
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT SHE PUBLISHED EARLIER BUT THE HOME OFFICE IS SAYING THAT IT HAS STRENGTHENED THE SAFEGUARDS IT'S MADE IT CLEARER WITH TIGHTER TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS THAT WAS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS THAT SOME OF IT WAS TOO CONFUSING TO LOOSEN THE WAY CERTAIN AREAS WERE DEFINED
AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE INCREASED PROTECTION'S THE HOME OFFICE SAYS FOR LAWYERS AND FOR JOURNALISTS TO ENSURE FOR EXAMPLE THAT A SENIOR JUDGE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY JOURNALISTIC SOURCES FOLLOWING A REQUEST FROM THE SECURITY SERVICE AS WELL AS THE POLICE BUT IN ITS MAIN AIMS WHICH IS STRONGER OVERSIGHT OVER EXISTING POWERS
AND REQUIREMENT ON COMMUNICATION FIRMS TO RETAIN DATA FOR TWELVE MONTHS A NEW POWERS FOR POLICE AND SECURITY AGENCIES TO ACCESS INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS ALL THOSE THREE ELEMENTS I THINK WILL STILL BE THERE RIGHT ON ON THE NEW POWERS FOR A POLICE IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS HOW FODDER THOSE GO BECAUSE THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS PUT FORWARD AT THE TIME WAS THAT THESE RECORDS WOULD WOULD SHOW THE AUTHORITIES FOR EXAMPLE YOU'D BEEN ON THE B.B.C. NEWS WEBSITE BUT NOT WHAT YOU HAD LOOKED AT
I THINK THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS THE FIRST ELEMENT IS THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO KEEP THIS DATA FOR TWELVE MONTHS THE SECOND THING IS WHAT DETAILS CAN THE POLICE AND SECURITY AGENCIES ACTUALLY SEE AND THE DRAFT BILL SAID THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS PURPOSES FOR THAT THE PURPOSES WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'VE GOT A QUESTION OF LIFE AND LIMB A MISSING CHILD OR A DANGEROUS SUSPECT WHO'S ON THE RUN AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMMUNICATING ONLINE IT WOULD ENABLE THE AUTHORITIES TO SEE WHICH
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THEY THEY'RE USING IS IT FACEBOOK IS IT WHAT'S UP FOR EXAMPLE THE AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES GIVEN BUT WHAT THESE POWERS DIDN'T ALLOW THE POLICE TO DO WOULD BE TO PURSUE INVESTIGATIVE LEADS FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY WERE FOLLOWING HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND THEY WANT TO KNOW IF THEY WERE BOOKING AIRLINE TICKETS
OR WHICH BANK THEY WERE USING TO TRANSFER MONEY THIS WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO DO SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS FROM WHAT THE HOME OFFICE IS SAYING IS THAT THAT POWER HAS NOW BEEN EXTENDED SO THE POLICE MAY NOW ACCESS THAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WEBSITES
WE ARE USING IN ORDER TO PURSUE INVESTIGATIVE LEADS AND I THINK THAT IS QUITE A MAJOR ENHANCEMENT OF THE POWERS UNDER THIS NEW BUILD TO BE POLISH LATER AND FINALLY WHAT DO THE POWERS SAY ABOUT ENCRYPTION HOW DOES IT TACKLE THE WAY THAT DATA'S ENCRYPTED AT THE MOMENT WELL WHAT THE THE HOME OFFICE IS SAYING IS THAT THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY THE GOVERNMENT POSITION ON THIS
SO THAT COMPANIES CAN ONLY BE ASKED TO REMOVE ENCRYPTION THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE APPLIED TO MYSTERIES ALTER TO INFORMATION AND ONLY WHERE IT'S PRACTICABLE FOR FOR THEM TO DO SO AND I THINK WHAT THE BILL WILL SAY IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T ASKING COMPANIES TO WEAKEN THEIR SECURITY BY UNDERMINING ENCRYPTION THERE WILL BE CERTAIN CASES WHEN THEY WILL HAVE THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE POWER TO TRY AND REMOVE ENCRYPTION AGAIN FOR EXAMPLE IN REALLY SERIOUS SITUATIONS
SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN IT IS SUPER TUESDAY IN THE UNITED STATES SO CALLED BECAUSE NO FEWER THAN ELEVEN STATES HOLD PRIMARY ELECTIONS AND BY THE END OF IT WE'LL GET A PRETTY CLEAR IDEA WHICH TWO CANDIDATES WILL FACE EACH OTHER IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER GENERAL IS THERE AND I ASKED HIM WHO THOSE TWO WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE
ALL THE FOCUS REALLY IS ON THE REPUBLICAN RACE AND I'M DONALD TRUMP AND THE VIEW AMONG REPUBLICANS WHETHER THEY SUPPORT HIM OR NOT IS THAT HE'S ALMOST NOW UNSTOPPABLE
THAT HE WILL GATHER ENOUGH SUPPORT IN THE TWELVE STATES THAT VOTE IN PRIMARIES AND KOCSIS TODAY TO MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE EITHER SENATOR RUBIO OR SENATOR TED CRUISE
HALTING HIS MARCH TO THE NOMINATION OF THE PARTY CONVENTION IN JULY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE HILLARY CLINTON IS ALMOST BOUND TO HAVE A GOOD NIGHT AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS BUT TONIGHT FRANKLY IS ALL ABOUT TRUMP EXTRAORDINARY STORY BY ANY STANDARDS IT IS AND YOU TALK TO PEOPLE AROUND THIS TOWN I'M IN WASHINGTON AS YOU KNOW AND THEY FREELY ADMIT THAT SIX OR NINE MONTHS AGO
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PREDICTED IT DESPITE ALL THE HOO HA ABOUT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT HE WILL WIN A MAJORITY OF THE STATES LIKE VERY COMFORTABLY I TALKED TO ONE POLITICAL CONSULTANT TODAY WE SAID LOOK HERE'S THE STORY OF TRUMP HE IS THE LOVE CHILD OF TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS
AND CORPORATE GREED AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY'RE NOMINATING PROCESS HAS BECOME THE MIDWIFE FOR A MONSTER THAT NOT MY WORDS THE WORDS OF A WASHINGTON OLD HANNAH HE IS
AN ABSOLUTE PHENOMENON BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE ISN'T THERE BETWEEN WINNING THE NOMINATION AND WINNING THE PRESIDENT'S WHILE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT CLINT COURSE PRIMARY ELECTIONS SET ABOUT EXPRESSING A VIEW FEELING DRAWN TO SOMEBODY
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT ELECTING A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY REPUBLICANS VERY SENIOR PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT THE TRUMP PHENOMENON BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM FOR A START DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S A REAL IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVE AND AS SOMEBODY PUT IT TO ME WELL HE HE'LL SAY ANYTHING TO GET ELECTED AND GOODNESS KNOWS WHAT HE MIGHT SAY IN THE CAMPAIGN BUT THEY FEARED DEEPLY THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS STRUCK A POPULAR CHORD HE IN THE END
WOULDN'T WIN AND FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH THE SENATE POSSIBLY UP FOR GRABS IN NOVEMBER IT'S REPUBLICAN CONTROL AT THE MOMENT OF COURSE
ON THE COAT TAILS OF THE DEMOCRAT NOMINEE WHO MIGHT WIN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT'S VERY VERY BAD NEWS APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF THE REALLY BIG STORY IN AMERICAN POLITICS IF ALL THAT GOES DOWN WITH TRUMP
WHERE DO THEY GO WHATEVER HAPPENS JOHN WE ARE IN FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY RIDE ALMOST NOBODY IN WASHINGTON NOW BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A PATH TO THE DOMINATION FOR ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COPE WITH MISTER TRUMP
WHO KNOWS THE VOTERS MIGHT HAVE A SURPRISE UP THEIR SLEEVES BUT TONIGHT HE'S GOING TO BE THE MAN WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A JIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED AND WE'LL REPORT LATER IN THE PROGRAMME THE TIME IS NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS AND THE DAILY MAIL CLAIMS A VICTORY OFTEN USE THAT MINISTERS WON'T BE AS THE PAPER PUTS IT NEUTERING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT COUNCILS QUANGOS ANOTHER STATE BODIES IT SAYS WILL BE FORCED TO PUBLISH THE FULL DETAILS OF THE PAY AND PERKS OF STAFF
POCKETING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR IT SEES THE DECISION IS A MAJOR BOOST FOR THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT CORRUPTION INCOMPETENCE AND WHAT IT CALLS GROTESQUE WASTE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE GUARDIAN FOCUSES OUR DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MAYOR OF LONDON
OVER THE E. OH DAVID CAMERON DESCRIBED THE CAMPAIGN TO REMAIN AS PROJECT FACT BORIS JOHNSON SAYS THAT'S BALONEY
THE PAPER TALKS OF INTENSIFYING HOSTILITIES IN THE TORY PARTY AND THAT IS THE THEME OF THE TELEGRAPHS LEAD PAID CLAIMS MY CAMERON IS PLANNING TO CULL HUNDREDS OF TORY ASSOCIATIONS AND STRIP LOCAL CHAIRMAN OF THEIR POWERS
SENIOR TORIES ARE SAID TO HOPE THE CHANGES WILL MAKE THE PARTY MORE PROFESSIONAL BUT CRITICS BENTLEY SEE IT AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF EURO SCEPTIC TORY ASSOCIATIONS OF THE PARTY'S NEXT A LEADERSHIP CONTEST SCIENTISTS ARE EXAGGERATED THE THREAT TO MARINE LIFE FROM CARBON ACCORDING TO A HEADLINE IN THE TIMES A MAJOR REVIEWS APPARENTLY FOUND AN INHERENT BIAS IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IN FAVOUR OF MORE CALAMITOUS PREDICTIONS
THE REVIEW PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE FOUND MANY STUDIES USED FLAWED METHOD SUBJECTING MARINE CREATURES TO SUDDEN INCREASES IN CARBON DIOXIDE THAT WOULD NEVER BE EXPERIENCED IN REAL LIFE IN SOME CASES SAYS THE JOURNALS EDITOR HOWARD BROWN WHEN IT WAS LEVELS BEYOND WHAT WOULD EVER BE REACHED IF WE BURNT EVERY MOLECULE OF CARBON ON THE PLANET
THE EXPRESS SAYS EXPERTS ARE WARNING OF A TRIPLE TAX RAID ON PENSIONS FINANCE ADVISORS APPARENTLY CLAIM A DESPERATE ATTEMPT BY THE CHANCELLOR GEORGE OSBORNE TO PLUG BRITAIN'S DEFICIT WILL SEE HIM RAID RETIREMENT PENSIONS FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A YEAR IN HIS BUDGET IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS THEY PREDICT THAT HE'LL INTRODUCE A FLAT RATE FOR PENSION TAX RELIEF FOR SWEEPING REFORM THE EXPRESS SAYS WHICH WILL AFFECT MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS SABRES
RESPONSIBLE SAVERS HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE A CASH MACHINE SINCE THE DAYS OF GORDON BROWN WAS OSBORNE MUST PUT A STOP TO THIS MADNESS AND FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO BALANCE THE BOOKS AND THE FRONT PAGE OF THE INDEPENDENT CARRIES A GRUESOME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MUMMIFIED REMAINS OF A MISSING GERMAN ADVENTUROUS SLUMPED OVER A TABLE IN HIS YACHT OFF THE PHILIPPINES NO ONE HAD HEARD FROM FIFTY NINE YEAR OLD MANFRED BADGE YOU'RE OUT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR IT'S THOUGHT HE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES POSSIBLY A HEART ATTACK AND THAT HIS BODY BECAME MUMMIFIED IN ITS FINAL POSITION
BECAUSE OF THE DRY SALTY CONDITIONS THE SUN CALLS THE BOAT FOR MUMMY CELESTE BUT I WAS NOW SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVER THE MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT MACEDONIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS SAID HIS COUNTRY ACTED RESPONSIBLY YESTERDAY WHEN THE SECURITY FORCES USE TEAR GAS AGAINST MIGRANTS WHO BROKE THROUGH A FENCE ON THE GREEK BORDER
M.P.S HAVE LABOUR AND TORY TOOK A SWING AT THE GOVERNMENT YESTERDAY OVER THE CONTROVERSIAL RULING THAT MINISTERS WHO ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR BRITAIN TO LEAVE EUROPE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SEE CERTAIN GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS HERE'S A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HILL
THE FRIVOLOUS AMONG US MIGHT THINK MINISTERS WOULD BE QUIETLY RELIEVED NOT TO HAVE TO READ LOTS OF ERNEST E.U. POLICY DOCUMENTS FOR THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS BUT THERE'S BEEN AN OUTCRY OVER PLANS TO PREVENT MINISTERS WHO OPPOSE E.U. MEMBERSHIP FROM SEEING CERTAIN KEY PAPERS IN THE RUN UP TO THE REFERENDUM I CONSERVATIVE MICHAEL FABRIC AND THOUGHT VOTERS WOULD BE LIVID ABOUT THAT
THIS IS A HUGE BLUNDER BECAUSE OUT THERE THE GENERAL PUBLIC
I THINK THAT THIS DECISION HAS BEEN PETTY AND HAS BEEN VINDICTIVE
AND MOREOVER THEY WILL SAY TO OUR GOVERNMENT
AND THIS PARTY OF WHICH I'M SO PROUD TO BELONG IF WITH SO MUCH STRONGER
WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE SO CAREFUL TO HIDE BUT THE MINISTER MATTHEW HANCOCK WASN'T CONVINCED THE E.U. DOCUMENTS WRY WOULD BE TOXIC WITH VOTERS I IMAGINE WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS CAN WE GET ONTO THE REAL DISCO
WHICH IS ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD BE IN OR OUT OF A REFORMED EUROPEAN UNION ANTI EXPLAINED THAT WHILE THE PRIME MINISTER HAD UNUSUALLY GIVEN HIS MINISTERS TO FREEDOM TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST IN THE REFERENDUM THE GOVERNMENT DID STILL HAVE A POSITION AND THAT WAS TO STAY IN THE E.U. IT IS THE DUTY OF CIVIL SERVANTS
TO SUPPORT THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY AND IT IS ONLY BECAUSE THE PRIME MINISTER IS ALLOWING MINISTERS TO REMAIN IN GOVERNMENT WHILST DISAGREEING WITH A SINGLE POLICY WHICH IS THE IN OUT POSITION
THAT THIS SITUATION ARISES AT ALL LOOKING AT THE DISGRUNTLED CONSERVATIVES GLOW RING BEHIND THE MINISTER LABOUR'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON REFLECTED AND ALL THE FUN HE MIGHT HAVE HAD IF THINGS HAD BEEN DIFFERENT SADLY
I AM NOT IN THE STRONGEST OF POSITIONS TO LECTURE THE POOR MINISTER HANDLING SPLITS IN HIS OWN PARTY BUT IN FACT HE AGREED WITH THE MINISTER THAT ON JUNE THE TWENTY THIRD THERE WAS A HUGE DECISION TO BE MADE ONE THAT COULD CHANGE THE COURSE OF THINGS LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS INTELLIGENCE SHARING THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND HOW WE ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HERE WE ARE ALL TODAY DISCUSSING THE GUIDELINES TO CIVIL SERVANTS AND SPECIAL ADVISERS
NOW DAVID CAMERON ALLOWED MINISTERS TO CAMPAIGN FOR AN OUTFIT BECAUSE THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE HAD TO RESIGN FROM THE GOVERNMENT LEAVING SOME VERY HIGH PROFILE GAPS BUT LABOUR'S US FLYNN THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS THAT MINISTERS WERE LEFT IN THIS KIND OF LIMBO ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THIS WORKABLE IS FOR THE MINISTERS TO RESIGN TO LEAVE OFFICE UNTIL AFTER JUNE THE TWENTIETH
IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH PROPOSE THESE
ARRANGEMENTS NEVERTHELESS THE CONSERVATIVES SIR EDWARD LEE ETHOS IT PUT MINISTERS WHO WANTED TO LEAVE IN A VERY AWKWARD SPOT IMAGINE HE HIMSELF WAS AN EAGER FISHERIES MINISTER EARLY IN HIS CAREER YARD AND AMBITIOUS GOOD LOOKING ALTHOUGH
I DO THE PRIME MINISTER'S BIDDING BUT WAIT NEARLY EVERYTHING TO DO WITH FISHERIES WAS Y. YOU RELATED SO WHAT WAS A EURO SCEPTIC MINISTER TO DO DO I GO HOME FOR MONTHS
DO I GET THERE I GET NO ADVICE TO MINISTERS IS NOT SO MUCH YES MINISTER BUT JUST GO HOME FOR FOUR MONTHS WE WILL SEE THEM
THE LIB DEM TOM BRAKE WONDERED HOW CIVIL SERVANTS WOULD KNOW WHETHER IT WAS O.K. TO LET A MINISTERS SEE A DOCUMENT OR NOT IS IT THE CASE THAT THERE IS A LIST OF MINISTERS WHO ARE
A LIST OF MINISTERS WHO ARE OUT A LIST OF MINISTERS WHO ARE UNDECIDED AND WHAT HAPPENS IF A MINISTER SWITCHES FROM THE ENTITY
MATTHEW HANCOCK REPLIED THAT CABINET MINISTERS HAD STATED THEIR POSITIONS AT THE FIRST MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AFTER HE STRUCK HIS DEAL AND I WASN'T LYING THEY'D CHANGE THEIR MINDS THE CONSERVATIVE CYRIL WALLASTON THOUGHT IT WAS CRUCIAL THE REFERENDUM WAS SEEMED TO BE A FAIR CONTEST
WHAT WOULD BE THE HARM IN ALLOWING FULL TRANSPARENCY OF THIS DATA SURELY THERE WOULD BE A MUCH GREATER HARM IF YOU WERE LEFT AT THE END OF THE REFERENDUM WITH PEOPLE FEELING THIS IT'D BE AN UNFAIR PROCESS
ALL IN ALL THE MINISTER WAS ON HIS FEET FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT HE HAD PRETTY MUCH ONE ANSWER AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES THAT THESE CIVIL SERVICE
IS DUTY BOUND BY TRADITION AND BY LAW TO FOLLOW
THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY AND THAT IS WHY THIS GUIDANCE IS CONSTRUCTED THUS BY MY RECKONING AROUND THE SEVENTEENTH TIME HE'D SAID IT
SUSAN HUMOUR REPORTING THERE MORE ON YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT JUST AFTER HALF PAST EIGHT ON RADIO FOUR LONG WAVE THE TIME NEARLY TEN TO SEVEN
THE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN WARNED THAT LEGAL ACTION OVER AIR POLLUTION COULD BE RE STARTED BECAUSE CAMPAIGNERS REGARDED AIR QUALITY PLAN AS INADEQUATE LAST YEAR THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED TO A SUPREME COURT RULING WITH A PLAN FOR THIRTY EIGHT ANTI POLLUTION ZONES BUT THE PRESSURE GROUP CLIENT EARTH SAYS IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CLIENTELE JAMES THORNTON IS WITH US GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHY DOES IT NOT GO FAR ENOUGH IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE THE PLAN DOES NOT DELIVER
IN AS SHORT A TIME AS POSSIBLE THE SUPREME COURT GAVE A VERY CLEAR ORDER TO THE GOVERNMENT TO CLEAN UP HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE REMEMBER
THE GOVERNMENT HAD AN OBLIGATION TO DO THE REQUIRED TWENTY TEN HE DIDN'T DO SO THE PLANET COME BACK WITH SAYS MAYBE IN LONDON WILL ACHIEVE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NOW THIS IS IT JUST TO TWENTY TWENTY IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO FOR FOR FOR MOST OF THE U.K. IT'S WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
SO THEY SAY BUT WITH WHO WITH RESPECT LONDON IT'S TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND IT IS OF COURSE THE WORST POLLUTION POLLUTION THE COUNTRY THEY'RE SAYING MAYBE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NOW THESE ARE NOT JUST TECHNICAL VIOLATION TO BLOCK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS FORTY THOUSAND
PEOPLE A YEAR DIE HAVE AIR POLLUTION IN THE U.K. THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IMAGINE IF FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR IN THE U.K. DIED OF CHOLERA WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING WE NEED TO POSTPONE COMPLIANCE FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS WE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT FOR TEN YEARS I DOUBT IT NOW WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO
WAS TO EVEN CONSIDER THE THINGS THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THEM TO LOOK AT ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THEY COULD PUT IN THEIR PLAN TO CLEAN UP THE AIR LIKE A TARGETED SCRAPPAGE SCHEME LIKE ECONOMICAL DO THE TENTACLES FOR EXAMPLE FOR DIESEL VEHICLE SORRY YES AND IF THEY WANTED TO THEY COULD HAVE CONSIDERED THEY SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED
LOOKING AT ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO GET PEOPLE THERE BY QUEEN AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THEY DID SET UP THESE THIRTY EIGHT ANTI POLLUTION ZONES THEY SAY THAT SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THEY'VE COMMITTED TWO BILLION POUNDS TO HELP BUS OPERATORS UP UPGRADE THEIR FLEETS REDUCE POLLUTION FROM A RANGE OF VEHICLES REFUSE TRUCKS FIRE ENGINES FOR EXAMPLE PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN ALTERNATIVE FUELS IT IS IT'S HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ISN'T IT
UM M. M. HEADING IS GIVING THEM AN AWFUL LOT OF THE WAY THE INSTRUCTION IS CLEAR I HAVE TO COMMEND HER COMPLAINT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY COULD HAVE COME INTO COMPLIANCE ALREADY HAD THEY STARTED WORK ON THESE THINGS A LONG TIME AGO THE KIND OF THINGS THEY'RE OFFERING IN THIS VERY VERY POOR PLAN WITHOUT HAVING DONE THEIR HOMEWORK WITHOUT HAVING GONE THROUGH EVEN THE CHECKLIST OF THINGS THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT
AYE THINGS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING AND TWENTY OH FIVE BUT NOT TWENTY SIXTEEN NOW WHAT WE NEED IS VERY CONCERTED ACTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING AND YOU THINK THAT BY RESTARTING THE LEGAL ACTION YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE BUT SAY YOU GET HER A RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURT AGREEING WITH YOU AND REDUCING THE TIME FRAME TIP TO BRING AIR POLLUTION LEVELS DOWN HOW WOULD THAT BE ENFORCEABLE
WELL THERE'S THE WAY IT WORKS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS STOOD UP AND SAID THAT IT WILL NOT COMPLY ESSENTIALLY ACTION IS A REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT ORDER THIS IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS MATTER I LOVE AND WELL THEY SAY THEY HAVE THEY
IN THEIR VIEW THEY HAVE COMPLIED BECAUSE THEY DECIDED WHAT THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME IS AND THEY'VE SET IT AS TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY FORTY FIVE IT'S BUT THERE WERE TWENTY FORTY FIVE YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THINKING I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I THINK WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SOME DAY MAYBE SOME FUTURE POLITICIAN WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS WE'RE NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY THEY STOOD UP IN THE SUPREME COURT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT GAVE THEM AN INJUNCTION AND SAID AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE
THE SUPREME COURT ORDER THE INTRODUCTION AND SAID ACCORDING TO THE LAW GET IN THE LAW YOU NEED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE WIG CAME BACK AND SAID IT'S STILL THEY DON'T BE ENFORCEABLE THEIR WAY OVER THIS WILL WORK IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS IN STARK DEFIANCE OF THE SUPREME COURT
IT'S ESSENTIALLY PUTTING HIMSELF IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF SAYING WE ARE ABOVE THE SUPREME COURT WE DON'T NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDER AND WE NEED TO GO BACK AND ESSENTIALLY EMBARRASS THE GOVERNMENT INTO COMPLYING WITH THE LAW OTHERWISE WE HAVE THE REAL DANGER OF LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BUT WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT CAN CHOOSE WHAT LIZA WANTS TO COMPLY WITH WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ADVISORS ON AIR QUALITY LATER THIS MORNING JAMES THORNTON A PLANTER THANK YOU

IT'S SEVEN O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY THE FIRST OF MARCH THE NEWS HEADLINES THIS MORNING MACEDONIA HAS DEFENDED ITS USE OF TEAR GAS AGAINST HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH A FENCE ON THE BORDER WITH GREECE THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT NEW PROPOSALS FOR THE MONITORING OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS CONTAIN STRONGER CONTROLS TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND THE AMERICAN ACTOR GEORGE KENNEDY WHO WON AN OSCAR FOR HIS ROLE IN COOL HAND LUKE HAS DIED TODAY'S NEWSREADER IS SUSAN
MACEDONIA HAS DEFENDED THE USE OF TEAR GAS AGAINST HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE COUNTRY FROM GREECE YESTERDAY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAID THE VIOLENCE WAS THE RESULT OF A SHAMEFUL SPATE OF DISCRIMINATORY BORDER CLOSURES LAST NIGHT MACEDONIANS FOREIGN MINISTER NICOLA POP ASKEY TOLD NEWSNIGHT ON B. B. C. TWO THAT HIS COUNTRY HAD ACTED RESPONSIBLY BY PREVENTING ILLEGAL CROSSINGS
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS SOME FOUR HUNDRED YOUNG MALE PEOPLE TRY FORCIBLY TO ENTER HAVE GONE IN TERRITORY FROM GREECE SO IF YOU WERE
PART OF THE SECURITY FORCES AND YOU'RE FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A VIOLENT ATTEMPT TO ENTER WITH ARNOLD WILL LINK TO REGISTER WANT TO GO TO RECEPTION CENTRES I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE AGREED ON AND THE EUROPEAN LEVEL
THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN GREECE AND SEVERAL COUNTRIES ALONG THE ROUTE NORTH INTO GERMANY IMPOSED NEW BORDER RESTRICTIONS TEN DAYS AGO A CORRESPONDENT DANNY SAVAGE REPORTS FROM THE BORDER
AFTER THE VIOLENT SCENES THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE WILL BE MORE TROUBLE BY THE BORDER GATE BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA SEVEN THOUSAND MIGRANTS ARE NOW CAMPED IN THE FIELDS BY THE CROSSING MORE ARE ARRIVING BY TAXI OR ON FOOT EVERY HOUR
THE AID AGENCIES SAY THEY ARE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT THEY'VE RUN OUT OF TENTS AND THERE'S A FOUR HOUR QUEUE AT MEAL TIMES THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY SHOW THAT ON SUNDAY MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MIGRANTS ARRIVED IN GREECE JUST NINETY TWO LEFT THE COUNTRY
SIR GREECE'S RAPIDLY SETTING UP MORE CAMPS ALTHOUGH WHAT IT REALLY WANTS IS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO FULFIL THEIR OBLIGATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO MIGRANTS

THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY AS PUBLISHING NEW PLAN SETTING OUT POWERS FOR THE POLICE AND THE SECURITY AGENCIES TO MONITOR PEOPLE'S COMMUNICATIONS THE LATEST VERSION OF THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL WHICH HAS BEEN DUBBED THE SNOOPERS CHARTER IS SAID TO CONTAIN MORE PROPOSALS TO SAFEGUARD PRIVACY BUT SOME CAMPAIGNERS AND M.P.S ARE STILL EXPECTED TO OPPOSE IT OUR HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT DANNY SURE REPORTS
THE INVESTIGATOR RE POWERS BILL IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS GAPS IN INTELLIGENCE GATHERING AND ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS DATA WHICH THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES ARE PUTTING LIVES AT RISK A DRAFT BILL PUBLISHED IN NOVEMBER WAS THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE SCRUTINY BY THREE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES THEY WERE CONCERNED THE PROPOSALS LACKED CLARITY AND COULD BE TOO INTRUSIVE
THE RESULT ACCORDING TO THE HOME OFFICE IS A BILL WHICH NOW CONTAINS TIGHTER TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS CODES OF PRACTICE SETTING OUT HOW THE POWERS WILL BE USED AND STRONGER CONTROL TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRIVACY
BUT THE LATEST MEASURES ALSO GO FURTHER THAN THE DRAFT BILL BY ALLOWING POLICE WHO ARE PURSUING INVESTIGATIVE LEADS TO SEE WHICH WEBSITE SOMEONE HAS ACCESSED MINISTERS WANT THE MEASURES ON THE STATUE BOOK BY THE END OF THE YEAR A TIMETABLE WHICH IS UNLIKELY TO SATISFY CRITICS WHO SAY THE PLANS ARE BEING RUSHED THROUGH

WITH ACCESS TO A LOCKED I TH OWN AS IN THE SAN BERNARDINO CASE THE TECH GIANTS HAD FIERCELY OPPOSED THE MOVE AND AS IN CALIFORNIA THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ARGUED THAT A LAW PASSED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE APPLY
THE JUDGE SIDED WITH THE COMPANY RULING THAT IT WAS NOT OBLIGED TO ASSIST FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS AGAINST ITS WILL AND ALSO THAT CONGRESS HAD NOT PASSED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THE RESULTS BY THE GOVERNMENT THE BROOKLYN CAISTOR'S NOT SANTA PRECEDENT BUT IT IS THOUGHT TO BE HELPFUL TO APPLE IN ITS ONGOING LEGAL BATTLE AGAINST THE F.B.I.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS REJECTED CALLS TO CHANGE THE LAW THAT ALLOWS JOURNALISTS AND VOTERS TO EXPOSE WRONGDOING AND INCOMPETENCE AND PUBLIC BODIES IT COME UNDER PRESSURE FROM COUNCILS TO CHARGE FOR A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS AND INTRODUCE OTHER RESTRICTIONS THE CABINET OFFICE MINISTER MATT HANCOCK SAID A REVIEW OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT DUE TO REPORT TODAY HAD FOUND THE LEGISLATION WAS WORKING WELL MORE FROM OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS HAWKINS
CAMPAIGNERS FEARED THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO CURB LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO REGULARLY REVEAL EMBARRASSING FACTS ABOUT ITS FAILINGS
THE MINISTERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO LEVY FEES FOR SUBMITTING INFORMATION REQUESTS INSTEAD SOME PUBLIC BODIES WILL HAVE TO REVEAL MORE WITH THOSE REQUIRED TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF SENIOR SALARIES ALSO HAVING TO RELEASE INFORMATION ABOUT STAFF EXPENSES AND OTHER BENEFITS AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO LEGISLATE TO SHORE UP MINISTER'S POWERS TO VETO THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION
SOME REGULAR USERS OF THE LAW THOUGH REMAIN ANXIOUS ABOUT WHETHER IT WILL BE EASIER FOR INSTITUTIONS TO RULE THE INFORMATION REQUESTS TO BURDENSOME TO BE MET AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT THE COST OF PROVIDING INFORMATION WILL CONTINUE TO TROUBLE SOME PUBLIC BODIES WITH LITTLE MONEY AND FEW STAFF TO SPARE
JUST OVER HALF A MILLION PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN ENGLAND WILL DISCOVER THIS MORNING WHETHER THEY'VE GOT A PLACE AT THEIR PREFERRED SECONDARY SCHOOL LAST YEAR AT EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS WERE DENIED THEIR FIRST CHOICE BECAUSE OF THE GROWING NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION HAS INSISTED AS BUILDING SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO GIVE A LARGE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ARE CHOICE

MIS SELLING CLAIMS AND IT'S TO SELL OFF ITS SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS
THE TIME IS NOW NINE MINUTES PAST SEVEN WHEN THE HOME SECRETARY PUT FORWARD THE INVESTIGATE THREE POWERS BILL LAST YEAR THE NEW INCARNATION OF WHAT WAS DUBBED THE SNOOPERS CHARTER IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT SHE SAID SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS PARTS OF THE TWENTY TWELVE LEGISLATION HAD BEEN DROPPED WE WILL NOT BE GIVING POWERS TO GO THROUGH PEOPLE'S BROWSING HISTORY THE EXAMPLE PUT FORWARD WAS THAT POLICE COULD SEE THAT YOU HAD ACCESS TO B. B. C. NEWS WEBSITE BUT NOT WHICH PAGES WERE VIEWED
TODAY THE AMENDED BILL IS PUT BEFORE PARLIAMENT IT GOES FURTHER THAN THE DRAFT VERSION ON POLICE ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS ALLOWING THEM GREATER POWERS OVER INTERNET RECORDS WHEN PURSUING INVESTIGATIVE LEADS WE'RE JOINED NOW FROM SALFORD BY JAMES BLESSING CHAIRMAN OF THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING DO YOU WANT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT THE HOME OFFICE HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO BE IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHERE IT'S ALL IN THE DETAILS THERE'S BEEN SOME NICE WORDS ABOUT HAVING LISTENED TO THE THREE INQUIRIES AND MADE SOME CHANGES AND SOME OF THE CHANGES LIKE PROTECTING JOURNALIST IS QUITE GOOD HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO COMMENTS IN THERE SAYING THAT UM FOR TECHNICAL
INVEST RECRUIT REASONS THERE AREN'T GOING TO BE SOME CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED SO LIKE I SAID IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHICH BITS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED NOT CHANGED WHICH BIN'S BITS HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND THE SPEED AT WHICH THIS IS BEING PUSHED THROUGH PARLIAMENT IS QUITE CONCERNING THE THE
THE SUBSTANTIVE POINT ON INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY IS THIS TWELVE MONTH STORAGE COLLECTION OF RECORDS
IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS IN MIND WORKABLE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW IT'S DOABLE GIVEN GIVE GIVEN A BIG BUDGET AND PLENTY OF TIME IT CAN BE DONE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT CAN IT BE DONE EFFICIENTLY MAYBE GOING AWAY BUT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO TO SEARCH THROUGH THIS MATERIAL AND CAN IT ACTUALLY BE KEPT SAFE BECAUSE YOU'RE STORING WHAT IS GOING TO BECOME A REALLY RICH VEIN IF I KNOW AS A HACKER
BUT YOU BANK WITH BARCLAYS FOR EXAMPLE RINGING YOU UP AND SAYING HELLO IT'S BARCLAYS HERE I SEE YOU WERE SHOPPING ONLINE AT SAINSBURY'S LAST WEEK AND WE SEEM TO HAVE SEEN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FALCON TRANSACTION AFTERWARDS IT'S VERY EASY FOR THEM TO TRY AND GET DETAILS FROM YOU ABOUT YOUR BANKING AND THEN USE THAT TO TAKE MONEY FROM WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU SAY THAT HE HE'S HIS DOABLE WITH THE RIGHT BUDGET IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT USE THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS
THIS IS ONE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT DURING THE ENQUIRIES WAS THE FACT THAT THE THE WORDING ON THE BILL SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE
BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR ALL THE COSTS INCURRED EVEN IF THEY THEY COVER THE COSTS OF SETTING IT UP IN THE FIRST PLACE AS A LONG TERM OPERATIONAL COST FOR RUNNING THE SERVERS IS KEEPING LOOKING AFTER IN DAY CENTRES MAKING SURE THE DATE DATA'S SECURE MAKING SURE THE SECURITIES KEPT UP TO DATE AND ALSO TRAINING PEOPLE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AFTER IT
YES THERE'S A COST THERE'S ACROSS THE SERVICE PROVIDERS EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THE EQUIPMENT RIGHT SHED IT IS THERE ALSO AN ISSUE WITH HOW PRACTICAL IT IS IN TERMS OF WHAT AT THE POINT OF A REQUEST COMES TO YOU WHAT YOU YOU HAND OVER BECAUSE THE RECORD YOU HAVE
HE'S A COMPLETE RECORD ISN'T IT OF EXACTLY WHICH PAGE A USER GOES THROUGH AND YET THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LAW SEEMS TO BE MORE BROAD THAN THAT IN IN THAT IN ACCESS TO THE SITE BUT NOT THE INDIVIDUAL PAGES YEAH AS AS WE'LL HAVE TO CAPTURE EVERYTHING AND SEE EVERYTHING YOU DO
AND THEN DO A FORM OF REACTING TO TAKE OUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID AND IT'S A PRACTICAL I THINK PROBABLY IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY ACCIDENTALLY GAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT TOO MUCH INFORMATION NOT DELIBERATE BECAUSE SYSTEMS DIDN'T QUITE WORK IN THE WAY THAT WAS EXPECTED AND ON ENCRYPTION THEY WERE YOU REASSURED THERE SEEMS TO BE PROVISION SAYING THAT OWED THAT YOU'D ONLY BE REQUIRED TO DECRYPT WHERE IT IS PRACTICAL TO DO SO
AGAIN WE'RE INTO THEIR TERRITORY IF YOU CAN SEE THE BATTLE IN THE U.S. AT THE MINUTE APPLE IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH S. TWO WHAT IS PRACTICABLE AND WHAT IS SENSIBLE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS JAMES BLESSING FOR THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU
THE TIME IS FOURTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN GREECE IS A COUNTRY UNDER SIEGE AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF THAT SIEGE ENDING VAST NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE LANDED ON THEIR ISLANDS AFTER CROSSING THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM TURKEY NINETY FOUR THOUSAND IN JUST THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THIS YEAR IT IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS TO ADD TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT WAS ALREADY DEVASTATING THE COUNTRY THE MIGRANTS STILL WANT TO STAY IN GREECE BUT THEY CAN'T GET OUT AT LEAST THEY CAN'T CROSS THE BORDER INTO MACEDONIA
AND WHAT WE SAW HAPPENING YESTERDAY IT WAS SOME OF THE MEN TRYING TO SMASH THROUGH THE FENCE THE MACEDONIANS HAD BUILT TO KEEP THEM OUT I'M JOINED ON THE LINE BY STELIOS WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FOR THE RULING THE SERIES OF PARTY GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THIS IS BEGINNING TO GET OUT OF CONTROL ISN'T IT
WHERE HER YES BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW THIS BY THE FACT THAT THEY GREEK PEOPLE ARE DISPLAYING
A SPIRIT OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE REFUGEES THERE ARE DISTRIBUTED IN FORD AND OF THE VOLUNTEERS ARE WORKING WHERE HE IS BECOMING MORE OR LESS OUT OF COURT TRAWLING FOR HOUSES EVERY DAY YOU KNOW
SO WHAT IS IT ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT YOU FACED BECAUSE CLEARLY MACEDONIA IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO CROSS THE BORDER IN VAST NUMBERS BECAUSE CLEARLY THEY WANT TO DO THAT IN THE HOPE THAT THEY CAN THEN GET INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND GO WHERE THEY WANT TO GO BUT MACEDONIA SIMPLY NOT GOING TO ALLOW THAT
WELL THERE WE ARE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR THE EUROPEAN DO UP LAY THIS USUAL COLLECTED THE CLEVER DECISION ALREADY DE YOU SEPTEMBER AND BUSINESS VISION OF SEPTEMBER OF STIPULATED THAT ONE HAVE A SIXTY THOUSAND REFUGEES FROM GREECE MAIN WILL BE HOSTED INTO DUE FOR A GUN THERE'S A GORDON ALL THE GREAT THIS
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY IGNORED AND AS WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL LOWS YOU KNOW THAT IN YOUR GO VISION SAYS THAT OR RIP B. BOTTOM MUST BE DEAKIN
AND EXAMINE THOSE FRIDGES AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF NATIONALITY YOU NO NO BUT BUT BUT IT DOES ALSO SAY THE GENEVA CONVENTION DOES SAY THAT REFEREE YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY LAND
OH YES OF COURSE OF COURSE THIS IS THIS ISN'T GREECE'S ACCEPT ACCEPTING EVERYBODY'S EXAMINER HAVE I.D. THERE ARE DUST YOU KNOW COMPRENDE GOOD BELIEVED TO BE DAY CAME INTO SOME HOURS BUT THEN THAT EUROPEANS WERE NEEDED THAT THIS IS NOT DO YOU KNOW I DID
THEY SAID DIVIDED EUROPE THIS IS EVERY KINDA DO IS DOING WHAT IT WANTS I COULDN'T DO THE VERY NARROW MINDED POLLY THE BODY
GREAT YOU KNOW BUT THAT IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM SO WHAT DO YOU DO I MEAN WHAT CAN YOU DO OBVIOUSLY YOU WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME SORT OF RECEPTION CENTRES AND YOU'RE USING THE OLD AIRPORT TO HOUSE MANY THOUSANDS OF THEM BUT BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT IF INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL NOT AGREE TO TAKE THESE MIGRANTS WHAT DOES GREASE DO
WELL WHAT A GOOSE CAN DO ALONE YOU KNOW YOUTHFUL EVERYBODY'S FALLING ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE YOU OR REFUGES ACCORDING TO
GENEVA CALL VENTURES THEY DENY THOSE SPEED ADULT HUMAN IS THE SPIRIT OF EUROPE OF THE FOLDED VALUE FOLLOW THE VALUES THAT FOLDED EURO
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR SOME KIND OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY AND OVARY PARTS TO DOOR DEAKIN BLOCK TO TAKE ITS OWN RESPONSE SHOULD BE THERE DO YOU KNOW
GREECE IS THERE THE LAST RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WAY OF ORIFICES FOR COME FROM THEN WE'D LOSE HAVE BEEN A WAR'S INVENTION IN IRAQ AND THE GROUND WAS INVOLVED IN THAT AND ALSO THE OTHER IN THERE ARE VERY MUCH TAKING THEIR OWN PART OF LOOSE WE SHOULD BE STIRRED AS COLOUR GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
SEVENTEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN BARCLAYS RESULTS HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED JO LINE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THEM SO YEAH THE PRE TAX PROFITS ARE BUY ONE MEASURE I DOWN TWO PERCENT TO FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS FOR THE YEAR
AND THEY ARE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH RAISING THE PROVISION FOR P.P.I. PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE WHICH IS COSTS THE BANKS SO MUCH MONEY THE RAYS THE BUT THAT PROVISION BY ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION POUNDS THAT MEANS THEY WILL HAVE PAID SEVEN POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION POUNDS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO WERE CHARGED OR SOLD P.P.I. ALL BANKS NOW ARE APPROACHING THIRTY BILLION POUNDS FOR P.P.I.
THERE ARE ALSO HAVING THE DIFFIDENT FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS TO TREAT PEDS PER SHARE FROM THIS YEAR THEY SAY THE REASON THEY'RE DOING THAT IS SO THAT THEY COULD SELL OFF THEIR SO CALLED NON CORE ASSETS WHICH IS THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON ART MAKING AS MUCH MONEY FOR THEM AS WELL
OTHER INTERESTING LINE IS THAT THEY'RE INTRODUCING A NEW STRUCTURE FOR THE BANK FOR INTRODUCING BARCLAY'S U.K. AND BARCLAYS CORPORATE INTERNATIONAL WHICH BASICALLY IS AHEAD OF THE RING FENCING OF BANKS IN THIS COUNTRY INTO THE RETAIL FOCUS BANKS WHICH WILL BE PROTECTED AND ANDY INVESTMENT BANKING DIVISION WHICH WILL BE MORE OF A CASINO ARE THEY DOING ANYTHING ABOUT BONUSES
YES THEY ARE CUTTING BONUS OF THIS OTHER COP BONUSES BY TEN PERCENT THIS YEAR THEY HAVEN'T COMMENTED ON WHETHER THE OUT THE PREVIOUS CHIEF EXECUTIVE WHO WAS DEFENESTRATED LAST YEAR WHETHER HE WILL GET A BONUS THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF THAT HE WILL GET HALF A MILLION POUNDS OF BONUS WHICH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SEE AS A REWARD FOR FAILURE BUT THE COUGHING
THEIR BONUS ANOTHER INTERESTING LINE ACTUALLY MICHELLE IS THAT THEY'RE SELLING THEIR AFRICAN BUSINESS BARCLAYS HAS BEEN IN AFRICA FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND SOME OF US MIGHT REMEMBER THE PROTESTS AGAINST BARCLAYS IN THE EIGHTIES AT THE TIME OF THE APARTHEID REGIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT BARCLAYS SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SELLING TO AFRICAN COMPANIES IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SO THEY'RE SELLING THEIR BUSINESS IN AFRICA THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS
SO LINE UM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW NINETEEN MINUTES PAST SEVEN IF YOUR CHILD FAILS TO GET INTO THE SECONDARY SCHOOL OF YOUR CHOICE WHAT CAN YOU DO THOUSANDS OF PARENTS IN ENGLAND WILL BE FACED WITH THAT QUESTION TODAY AS THEY LEARN ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF PLACES FOR THE AUTUMN
LAST YEAR EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN OR ONE IN SIX OF THE TOTAL MISSED OUT ON THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF SCHOOL THE GOOD SCHOOLS GUIDE TRIES TO HELP PARENTS IN THIS SITUATION BERNADETTE JOHN IS ONE OF THEIR ADVISORS AND SHE'S WITH US NOW GOOD MORNING MORNING WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF OF THE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN WHO MISS OUT ON THEIR FIRST CHOICE
WE'RE EXPECTING THIS YEAR THAT THE GOOD IT'LL DO THAT'S NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE WON'T GET A SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE SO MORE THAN LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE POPULATION'S INCREASED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MORE APPLICATIONS GOING IN THERE CHEF THIS IS ENTIRELY LINKED THEN TWO TO WHAT'S CALLED A DEMOGRAPHIC BOWLS BUT BUT ALSO LINKED TO THE NUMBERS OF NEW SCHOOLS BEING OPENED
YES IT IS IT'S THE DEMOGRAPHIC BUT BULGE BUT ALSO SINCE THE DEREGULATION OF EDUCATION LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NO LONGER IN CONTROL OF BUILDING NEW SCHOOLS AND WERE RELIANT ON FREE SCHOOLS ACADEMIES AND SO ON COMING IN TO SET UP THEIR SCHOOLS
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BUILDING THE SCHOOL IN THE SCHOOLS IN THE PLACES WE NEED THEM AND PLAN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DELAYED WE HAVE SEVERAL THAT WERE DUE TO OPEN IN TIME FOR SEPTEMBER WHICH WON'T NOW OPEN SO FOR THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS SITUATION TODAY WHERE THEY DON'T GET IN THEIR CHILD DOESN'T GET INTO THEIR FIRST CHOICE SCHOOL WHAT DO YOU ADVISE THEM TO DO
FIRST THING DON'T SAY TO YOUR CHILD WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE WORST CASE SCENARIO THE I MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO THAT SCHOOL AND YOU ARE ENTITLED TO IMMEDIATELY GO ON THE WAITING LIST FOR ANY SCHOOL THAT YOU PUT ON YOUR SECONDARY APPLICATION FORM AND THERE WILL BE SOME SHAKE OUT BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER AS PEOPLE MOVE AND DON'T TAKE UP PLACES AND SO ON
YOU ALSO ENTITLED TO GO TO APPEAL TO ANY OF THE SCHOOLS THAT YOU NAMED THERE'S NO CHARGE FOR THAT AND YOU DON'T NEED A SOLICITOR IF PEOPLE ARE FLOUNDERING THEY CAN COME TO US THAT GOOD SCHOOLS GUIDE AND WE CAN TALK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS AND YOU CAN MOVE IS THE OTHER THING PEOPLE COME AND SAY IF THEY'RE IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION
FIND HER FIND TO SCHOOL IN COMMUTING DISTANCE OF WHERE WE NEED TO WORK BECAUSE THERE ARE POCKETS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SITUATION ISN'T THE SAME OBVIOUSLY IT'S WORSE IN THE BIG CITIES LONDON BIRMINGHAM MANCHESTER LIVERPOOL BUT MOVING IS AN INTERESTING ONE BECAUSE THERE ARE CASES AREN'T THERE WHERE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PULLED OUT OF SCHOOL THAT THEY HAVE GOT INTO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED LATER THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCED REASONS OR GROUP IT WASN'T DONE IN THE RIGHT WAY
YES BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT HAVE A WE'RE DIFFERENT I MEAN IN LANCASHIRE THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND PLACES GOING BEGGING LAST YEAR CENTRAL BEDFORDSHIRE THERE'S NINETY NINE POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE GOT THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF SCHOOL IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO A LONDON BOROUGH OF HAMMERSMITH AND FULHAM TWELVE PER CENT OF CHILDREN DON'T GET ANY OF THE SIX CHOICES
SO IF WHEN WHEN PARENTS DO APPEAL WHAT ARE LIKELY TO BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GROUNDS ON ON WHICH AN APPEAL GOES GHOSTLY THAT THE BASIS OF AN APPEAL IS THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE HARM DONE TO YOUR CHILD BY NOT GETTING TO THE SCHOOL IS GREATER THAN THE HARM WILL BE DONE TO THAT SCHOOL COMMUNITY THROUGH OVERCROWDING THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU DO YOU DO YOU NEED PROOF YOU CAN'T JUST GO ALONG IF THEY WAS YOU MUST HAVE DOCUMENTARY PROOF BUT
THEY CAN BE REASONS SUCH AS YOUR YOUR CHILD MIGHT HAVE HAD A SPECIAL NEED OR HEALTH CONCERN THAT MEANS THEY CAN'T GO TO THE SCHOOL THEY'VE BEEN ALLOCATED THE JOURNEY MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU CAN PROVE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TO MAKE THEIR CONNECTIONS AND GET THERE ON TIME AND SOMETIMES THE SITUATION'S PERHAPS A GIRL'S BEING BULLIED BY A TRIO OF GIRLS AND THEY'RE MOVING ON TO THE SAME SCHOOL AND GIVE EMOTIONAL DAMAGE YOU CAN SEE IF YOU CAN SHOW HER TRACK RECORD BERNADETTE JOHN FROM THERE GOOD SCHOOLS GUIDE THANK YOU

SOMETHING REALLY CURIOUS AS HAPPENED AND THAT IS THAT EVER SINCE MAASTRICHT WHEN WE UNDER LABOUR SIDE LOOKED AT THE TOURIST TEARING THEMSELVES APART OVER EUROPE I THINK WE'VE STOPPED THINKING ABOUT WOULD DO EUROPEAN UNION REALLY MEANS THAT COMBINED WITH FOOD IN THE EIGHTIES HE WAS THE DELOS COMMISSION WHICH GAVE A CERTAIN THINGS LIKE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN ARE STUCK IN THE COLLECTIVE MIND AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T FACED UP TO WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION MEANS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND WHAT OUR VOTERS
OF ESSENTIALLY THAT IF YOUR NEIGHBOUR MEMBER AND YET ACTUALLY RADICALLY AND YOU THINK THIS SHOULD BE WORKERS' RIGHTS THEN YOU LOOK AT A EUROPEAN UNION THAT IN GREECE IS SELLING OUT THE WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNG WORKERS IN PURSUIT OF SAVING THE EURGH IT HAS BECOME COLLECTIVE INTEREST AND I THINK ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE THAT
WELL EXCEPT THAT THAT ISN'T TRUE WAS IT THEY'RE NOT SELLING OUTWORKERS IN GREECE BY ESTABLISHING THE EURO THEY ESTABLISHED THE EURO GREECE IS A PART OF THE EUROZONE AND THAT IS
ANNIE EFFECT BUT THAT WAS THE PLAN THERE'LL BE NOBODY SAID NO WE DON'T LIKE THEY WORK WORKERS IN GREECE WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING NASTY TO THEM I MEAN THIS IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE WORKED AND DIDN'T WORK
SO ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND THEREFORE WHAT I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT IN THE RIG NEGOTIATIONS AND EVEN AS A LABOUR MEMBER I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THEN WAS A RECOGNITION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR SOME COUNTRIES YOU WILL HAVE A SINGLE CURRENCY WHICH WILL REQUIRE DEEPER INTEGRATION WHICH WE REQUIRE THAT MUCH MER MOVEMENT OF LABOUR AND OTHERS WON'T HAVE THAT I WOULDN'T WE'RE NOT IN THE EURO ZONE SO FINE
BUT THE FACT THE DURAS ONLY EXISTS AND THE FACT THAT THE STRUCTURE DOES NOT ACCEPT THAT THIS IS A PERMANENT STATE IS A PROBLEM FOR US
BUT YOUR LEADER OBVIOUSLY TAKES ANOTHER LEADER WANTS A SAY IN THE PROBLEM IS HE SAYS THAT THE DEGREE JUST SAID THIS ABOUT THE DEGREE OF INWARD LOOKING POLITICS THAT'S GOING ON AS MEANT THAT GREASE FOR INSTANCE IS MAKING A HUGE EFFORT THIS IS ON BRETON ITALY'S MAKING A HUGE EFFORT A REFUGE GERMANS MAKING A HUGE EFFORT EVERY OTHER COUNTRY'S PUTTING BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS ON ALONG THEIR BORDERS TO KEEP DESPERATE PEOPLE SURELY IN THIS CENTURY THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS REACH OUT AND TRIED TO HELP HER
AND HOW BEING A PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD ENABLE THAT SHOULDN'T IT BUT THE DEER OPINION IN AND OUR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES IS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND WHAT THIS IS AN ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE LABOUR IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SO THAT ALL THE KIND OF THINGS WHICH YOU KNOW ARE THEY TO MINIMUM WAGE ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS
THOSE WERE ACHIEVED BY WHAT LABOUR DID IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SO YOU CAN BE INTERNATIONALIST YOU WANT A LABOUR GOVERNMENT YOU USEFUL YOU COME YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT INTERNATIONAL THINGS BUT
YOU STILL HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WHO DECIDES IT IF YOU'VE GOT A EUROPEAN UNION THAT HAS CENTRE RIGHT GOVERNMENT IN THE MAJORITY THEN YOU WOULD GET A EUROPEAN UNION THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE KIND OF GOVERNMENT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT YOU WERE NOT AN INTERNATIONALIST I AM AN INTERNATIONALIST BUT THE TWO THINGS ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE
WHAT MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH IS AN ORGANISATION THAT ACCORDING TO MANY PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE PASSIONATELY BELIEVE THIS HAS HELPED KEEP THE PEACE IN EUROPE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PRIZE POLITICAL PRIZE THAT HISTORY HAS ON OFFER HAS MANAGED TO HELP KEEP THE PEACE FOR THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS I THINK THIS IS A RATHER CURIOUS READING OF HISTORY
FRANCE AND GERMANY COMING TOGETHER WITHIN THE ENVELOPE OF NATO AND THE COLLECTIVE SECURITY THAT IT WAS KEPT THE PEACE WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION UP TO A CERTAIN POINT PROVIDED FOR WAS A. POLITICAL STABILITY WITHIN EIGHTY FENCE FRAMEWORK BUT IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW
AND THE REFUGEE CRISIS IS JUST THE LATEST DEMONSTRATION THAT POLITICAL STABILITY IS BEING SERIOUSLY QUESTIONS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AS AN INSTITUTION IS NOT RESPONDING TO PROPERLY HE'S A STUART THANK YOU VERY MUCH BE TALKED TO PETER MANDELSON INCIDENTALLY WHO MAY JUST POSSIBLY BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM YOU HAD TO BOSS THE HEAT THANK YOU BUT I WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT TODAY'S PAPERS ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE TIMES AND THE SUN HAVE DRAMATIC PICTURES OF TENSE A BLAZE AT THE MIGRANT CAMP KNOWN AS THE JUNGLE IN CALAIS
VIOLENCE BROKE OUT YESTERDAY'S THE AUTHORITIES MOVED IN TO CLEAR THE AREA THE SUN CALLS IT JUNGLE WARFARE IT TALKS OF A DEEPENING CRISIS THERE AND ON GREASERS BORDER WITH MACEDONIA WHEN MIGRANT SMASH DOWN OFFENCE WITH A BATTERING RAM THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAS A PICTURE OF REFUGEES CHOKING ON TEAR GAS FIRED BY MACEDONIAN POLICE
IT SAYS THE EVENTS OF HEAPED PRESSURE ON E.U. LEADERS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS AHEAD OF A SERIES OF CRUCIAL MEETINGS THIS MONTH THE MIRROR EARLY FOR THE CLAIM THAT TWENTY TORY M.P.S MAY HAVE BREACHED STRICT ELECTION SPENDING RULES SAYS THAT CONSERVATIVES ELECTION BATTLE BUS HELP TWENTY FOUR TORIES TO VICTORY BUT NONE OF THEM DECLARED IT IN THEIR CAMPAIGN BUDGET HAD THEY DONE SO THE PAPER SAYS TWENTY MAY HAVE BEEN OVER THE SPENDING LIMIT SERIOUS QUESTIONS NEED ANSWERING AS THE MIRROR
THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION IS UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE THE EVIDENCE A SPOKESMAN FOR THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY DENIED ANY BREACH OF RULES FEEL THE PAPER EXPENSE RETURNED WERE COMPLETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW THE U.K. IS USING LESS STUFF ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN FIGURES FROM THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS SHOW THE AMOUNT OF FOOD FUEL METAL AND BUILDING MATERIALS BEING USED HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE ON AVERAGE WE EACH GOT THROUGH FIFTEEN TONS OF MATERIALS THEN COMPARED TO JUST TEN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
ONE EXPLANATION IS THAT DIGITAL PRODUCTS HAVE MADE US LESS RELIANT ON RESOURCE INTENSIVE GOODS THE PAPER SAYS THE FIGURES WILL SPARK FRESH SPECULATION THAT BRITAIN AND OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE REACHED SOMETHING DESCRIBED AS PEAK STUFF THE POINT AT WHICH OUR CONSUMPTION OF RAW MATERIALS PER HEAD HAS REACHED ITS LIMIT
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CLEARING THE ACCURACY OF THE ONUS FIGURES THE TIMES REPORTER STUDY SUGGESTING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE HELPING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO GIVE UP SMOKING RESEARCHERS AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON CALCULATE THEY COULD BE HELPING MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR HAVE QUICK TOBACCO TIMES ACCUSES BIG TOBACCO COMPANIES HEALTH REGULATORS AND GOVERNMENTS OF FORMING AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CIGARETTE PEOPLE WANT TO USE ON THE TIME SAYS THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO SO
AND FINALLY THE NEW PAPER NEW DAY WAS LAUNCHED WITH A PROMISE TO BE NEUTRAL THEY TOO AND IT APPEARS TO BE STRUGGLING A FEATURE ON SUPER TUESDAY IN THE U.S. ELECTIONS BEGINS IMAGINE AMERICA GOES MAD AND ELECTS DONALD TRUMP AS ITS FORTY FIFTH PRESIDENT
THE TIME IS NOW QUARTER TO EIGHT THIS WEEK WHERE BROADCASTING A SPECIAL SERIES ABOUT WHAT LIFE IS LIKE INSIDE THE CAPITAL OF THE SO CALLED ISLAMIC STATE ROCKER IN EASTERN SYRIA IT IS BASED ON A DIARY KEPT BY AN ACTIVIST FROM A GROUP THEY'RE CALLED I'LL SHOWER KIA TWENTY FOUR YESTERDAY HE TOOK US BACK TO WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED HE WAS ARRESTED AND TOLD HE WOULD FACE FORTY LASHES TODAY HE TELLS US WHAT HAPPENED NEXT TO PROTECT HIM WE'VE CHANGED SOME MINOR DETAILS AND HIS WORDS ARE SPOKEN BY AN ACTOR
WITHOUT ANY MERCY OR HUMANITY HE LASHED ME I COULD SEE IN HIS EYES THAT HE TOOK PRIDE IN THIS I LEFT THE HEADQUARTERS OF HASSIBA DASHES THE RELIGIOUS POLICE WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY FRONT DOOR I COLLAPSED AFTER HEARING WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME MY PREGNANT SISTER HAVE GONE INTO SHOCK AND BECOME BLEEDING HEAVILY WE KNEW WE HAD TO GET HER TO A GYNAECOLOGIST AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE CLINIC WE FOUND THAT IT WAS SHOT IMAN OUTSIDE TOLD ME THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN MY NEIGHBOUR FORTY YEARS BUT THAT WAS ARRESTED HIM AND SHUT DOWN HIS CLINIC THEY FORBID MALE DOCTORS FROM TREATING FEMALE PATIENTS WE HAD TO TRAVEL TO FIND A FEMALE GYNAECOLOGIST
MY SISTER WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND REST LATER IN THE DAY I BUMPED INTO AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE LOOKING NERVOUS HE PULLED ME ASIDE WE FORMED A SECRET CAMPAIGN GROUP AGAINST UPPISH HE WHISPERED WE WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW WHAT THESE MURDERERS ARE DOING TO OUR CITY YOU CAN PLAY A PART
ON THE WAY HOME I MET MY FRIEND MOHAMMED WHO RUNS A SHOP HE POINTED TO A STORE ACROSS THE WROTE OWNED BY A MAN WHO HAD KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS A GROUP OF DUTCH MEN WE'RE SPEAKING TO
ONE OF THEM WAS HOLDING A BUNCH OF PAPERS IN HIS HANDS HEY ONE OF THEM SHOUTED TO US WHO OWNS THIS SHOP
HOW MANY REPLIED IT'S MINE HOW CAN I HELP WE'RE FROM THE CAR HE TOLD US THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHARITY FOR THE PORT BUT ACTS AS A KIND OF TAX WHAT DAY
AND WE'RE HERE TO COLLECT THE MONEY YOU OWE US HAMMOND INSISTED THAT HE'D ALREADY PAID ALL THAT WAS DUE SHUT UP THE DASH MANDELA BACK YOU MUST BE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ZILLION POUNDS WERE HAMMERED GASPED THAT'S TOO MUCH MONEY
HE PAID THE SEVERED HEADS OF OTHERS WHO'VE CROSS DA I SHALL HANG ON PARK FENCES AND LAMPPOSTS AS A BRUTAL WARNING
THAT NIGHT I WERE HOME WAS ROCKED BY EXPLOSIONS I SAW BOMBER'S HIGH ABOVE I SWITCHED ON THE T.V. TO HEAR THE NEWS THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION WAS LAUNCHING ITS FIRST STRIKES AGAINST THAT
THE NEXT DAY IN LOCAL CAB DRIVER TOLD ME THAT'S MANY OFF DAKSHA'S BUILDINGS HAD BEEN HIT HE WOULDNAE POLICE ARE ROAMING THE STREETS IN BIG NUMBERS LOOKING FOR SPIES WHO GUIDED THE PLANES
IT CANNOT HAD GATHERED ON THE DE PAUL CROUCHED INSIDE IT WAS A WOMAN I ASKED PEOPLE WHO SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WAS DOING THERE BEFORE I GOT AN ANSWER A LARGE MAST MAN BEGAN READING THIS WOMAN WAS ADULTEROUS AND HER PUNISHMENT IS TO BE STONED TO DEATH HIS WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE NOISE OF FOUR PLANES OVERHEAD
LORCAN VENDOR SHOUTED HIDE HIDE THERE WERE BIG EXPLOSIONS AND BODY PARTS EVERYWHERE MOST OF THEM BELONG TO CIVILIANS IT WAS A RUSSIAN AIR A STRIKE SUPPOSEDLY TARGETING TERRORISTS ISN'T THE TERRORISM WE SUFFERED UNDERGROUND ENOUGH NOW YOU BRING IT FROM THE SKIES AS WELL
AND WE'LL HAVE THE NEXT ENTRY IN THIS DIARY AT THE SAME TIME TOMORROW THEY'RE ALSO VIDEO VERSIONS PRODUCED BY THE ARTIST AN ANIMATOR SCOTT QUELLA AND THEY'RE ON OUR WEBSITE NOW AND ALSO ON A SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS THE TIME IS NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND WITH US IN THE STUDIO THIS MORNING AS THE REVEREND LUCY WINK AT HE WAS THE RECTOR OF SAINT JAMES' PICCADILLY GOOD MORNING LUCY GOOD MORNING JOHN
I GUESS THAT A LOT OF US WILL AT SOME STAGE TODAY BY SOMETHING WE MIGHT NOT VISITOR SHOP IT MIGHT BE AN ONLINE TRANSACTION OR AN IMPULSE BUY FROM THE PHONE IT'S SUCH AN EVERYDAY PART OF LIFE FOR THE MAJORITY OF US THAT WE DO IT ALMOST WITHOUT THINKING
AND OUR ENJOYMENT OF THE CONVENIENCE OF IT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE DECISIONS TAKEN BY SUPERSTORES SUCH AS MORRISONS WHO YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED A DEAL WITH AMAZON TO BRING AN EVEN GREATER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS TO US ON OUR SCREENS
OUR BEHAVIOUR IS BEING MONITORED CLOSELY BY RETAILERS WE APPARENTLY ARE PREPARED TO GO IN STORE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE THING WE'RE THINKING OF BUYING BUT THEN WE GO ONLINE EVEN IN THE SHOP STANDING IN FRONT OF IT AND BUY IT CHEAPER THAN GOING TO THE TILL
THE RETAIL CONSORTIUM ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK THAT THEY ANTICIPATE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS DISAPPEARING IN THEIR SECTOR PARTLY DUE TO A CHOOSING TO SHOP ONLINE
AND DESPITE THE IRRITATION OF THE UNEXPECTED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA WE'RE ALSO CHOOSING TO USE SELF SERVICE SUPERMARKET CHECKOUTS RATHER THAN TALK TO A HUMAN BEING
WE ARE ON THE WHOLE SMART CONSUMERS WITH SMARTPHONES GETTING SMARTER BUT SHOULD WE CONGRATULATE OURSELVES ON THIS SMARTNESS
MOST OF US DESCRIBE OURSELVES IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF WAYS DEPENDING ON WHO WE'RE TALKING TO WE MIGHT SAY WHERE FOR EXAMPLE A VEGETARIAN OR A GRANDFATHER OR WORK IN H.R.
BUT IT'S OUR IDENTITY AS CONSUMERS EVEN SMART CONSUMERS THAT CAN DEVOUR ALL THE OTHERS IF WE TAKE NOTICE NOT OF WHO WE SAY WE ARE BUT HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY LIVING
BECAUSE CONSUMING CAN BECOME THE DEFINING WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH THE WORLD OUR LANGUAGE TELLING WE STARTED TO SAY THAT WE CONSUME NOT ONLY FOOD BUT NEWS ENTERTAINMENT EVEN PEOPLE
AND WHILE OUR ABILITY TO TRADE AS A WAY OF EXPRESSING OUR CREATIVITY AND CO OPERATION AS PEOPLE THERE ARE MECHANISMS AT WORK IN OUR OWN HEARTS AND IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION WE WANT TO CHALLENGE FUNDAMENTALLY
CHRIST TAUGHT THAT LIFE IS SIMPLY AN ASTONISHING GIFT
WITHOUT PRICE UNEARNED AND I ASKED FOR A GIFT OF TIME AND PEOPLE AND ACTIVITY NURTURED BY AN INNER LIFE FULL OF HOPES AND REGRETS THAT WE HARDLY ACKNOWLEDGE
AND THAT LIFE CARRIES WITHIN IT AN INNATE DIGNITY INTERDEPENDENT WITH EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ON THE EARTH AS A CHRISTIAN I FIND THAT THIS WAY OF INTERPRETING HOW HUMAN LIFE IS PRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE TO OUR IDENTITY AS CONSUMERS
BECAUSE LIFE'S AIM BECOMES NOT TO ACQUIRE AND USE ALL WE CAN BUT TO MIRROR THE UNIMAGINABLE GENEROSITY OF GOD AND LEARN NOT SO MUCH TO SELL OURSELVES AS TO GIVE OURSELVES AWAY
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH THE REVEREND LUCY WINK AT THE TIME HE WAS EIGHT MINUTES TO EIGHT THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED ACCIDENTAL DEATHS IN WATER IN THE U.K. LAST YEAR MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF THA TALLA TEAS AND DOMESTIC FIRES ALL CYCLING DEATHS ON THE ROAD DROWNING AS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO TACKLE THOSE NUMBERS
WITH A GROUP OF ORGANISATIONS AND CHARITIES TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE MORE AWARE OF THE RISKS THE ROYAL LIFESAVING SOCIETY'S AMONG THOSE INVOLVED JACKIE ROBERTS IS ONE OF THE AMBASSADORS IN JANUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN HER DAUGHTER MEGAN DROWNED IN THE RIVER INNS IN YORK AFTER A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS WERE ALSO JOINED BY DAWN WHITTAKER LEAD OFFICER FOR WATER SAFETY AT THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
CHUCKIE WHAT HAPPENED TO MEGAN THAT NIGHT SHE WAS A STUDENT SOCIAL NIGHT OUT MIDWEEK BEFORE UNIVERSITY HAD REOPENED AFTER CHRISTMAS AND SHE AS THEY LEFT THE NIGHTCLUB THEY WERE ALL QUITE DRUNK AND SHE GOT A BIT LEFT BEHIND A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THEN INADVERTENTLY FOLLOWS ONE OF THE BOYS AHEAD HERE
TURNED RIGHT BEFORE GOING EVER LENTIL BRIDGE WE THINK HE'D GONE DOWN FOR A WEEK AND THEN HE DIDN'T SEE HER AND THEN SHE'S GONE UNDER THE BRIDGE AND FALLEN INTO THE WATER ACCIDENTALLY
THEN HE RAN BACK UP JOIN THE OTHERS AND NO ONE WAS AWARE THAT SHE HAD GONE MISSING COULD SHE SWIM SHE WAS A VERY STRONG SWIMMER YES
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FALLING INTO FREEZING COLD FAST FLOWING WATER INFLUENCED BY ALCOHOL AS WELL OBVIOUSLY SHE WOULD HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL AND THAT IS WHY YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS CAMPAIGN AND SPECIFICALLY YOU'VE BEEN PART OF THE CAMPAIGN TRYING TO MAKE STUDENTS AWARE NOT TO DRINK AND DROWN THE CIVIC AS THAT YES THERE IS YES IT'S A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN BUT I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH IT IN YORK RECENTLY
AND WE BELIEVE IT'S BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL FROM THE FEEDBACK WE'VE HAD ACTUALLY WENT OUT ON ONE OF THE THE EVENINGS WITH HER A TEAM CALLED THE NIGHT SAY TEAM FROM UNIVERSITY OF YORK AND WHO LOOK OUT FOR OTHER STUDENTS AND IT WAS FASCINATING ACTUALLY TO SEE THEM LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER IN A STEW DO YOU THINK THAT MEGAN WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE WATER AS A AS A RISK THE WAY THAT SHE WOULD HAVE ASSESSED OTHER DANGERS OF RISKS AND HER LIFE INCLUDING GETTING INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN DRINKING
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE EVEN OCCURRED TO HER THAT THAT RIVER WAS A POTENTIAL RISK
AND THESE ARE THE SORTS OF INCIDENTS AT THE FIRE SERVICE OFTEN RESPONDS TO DAWN WHITTAKER WOOD WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY WHY YOU'RE IN YOU'RE INVOLVED IS IS THAT AN ISSUE TO YOU THAT THE PERCEPTION OF THE DANGERS OF WATER YES IT IS I THINK
REGULARLY WE ASSUME AND ASSOCIATE WATER WITH LEISURE ACTIVITY AND AND FUN AND SPORTS AND ACTIVITY AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS IS HELP WITH THE PROMOTION OF UNDERSTANDING HOW TO ENJOY THE WATER SAFELY
BUT YES ABSOLUTELY MANY PEOPLE AND COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT HAS A LOT OF THESE ACCIDENTS HAPPEN WITH PEOPLE YOU NEVER INTENDED TO HAVE TO GO INTO THE WATER AS WAS THE CASE OF MEGAN THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AROUND FORTY FOUR PERCENT ACTUALLY THAT THE FIGURE OF PEOPLE WHO NEVER INTENDED TO BE IN THE WATER IN FIRST PLACE AND HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AND AND IN IN'T MEGAN'S CASE SHE WAS A STRONG SWIMMER THAT AGAIN MIGHT BE
COME INTO PEOPLE'S ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK IF I DO FALL IN OLDER JUST MYSELF OUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO THERESA'S PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OF COURSE THAT WE GET YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR COMPETENCY BE ABLE TO SWIM AND THEY'RE A STARTLING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN LEAVING SCHOOL WHO WHO CANNOT BUT THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION WITH
PEOPLE ASSUMING THEY CAN SWIM AND THEREFORE THEY MAY BE O.K. BUT OF COURSE THE MAJORITY PEOPLE IN THE U.K. LEARNED TO SWIM IN LOVELY WARM SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND SWIMMING POOLS AND EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR PYJAMAS OFF TO DO THEIR LIFESAVING BADGE THAT DOESN'T EQUATE TO THE REALITIES OF OPEN WATER
MEGAN A BIT JACKIE THERE'S ALSO THE CASE NOT JUST OF MAKING YOUNG PEOPLE AWARE OF THE RISK BUT BUT CERTAIN BASIC THINGS THAT PERHAPS LOCAL AUTHORITIES NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF ME YORK WHERE AND WHERE YOUR DAUGHTER WAS THEN THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF POTENTIAL DANGER FROM THE RIVERS YEAH THEY'VE GOT A VERY HIGH RATE OF DROWNING IN YORK
THEY DID DO A RISK ASSESSMENT AFTER MEGAN'S DEATH BECAUSE HEAD AND HER DEATH WAS FOLLOWED VERY QUICKLY BY TWO YOUNG MEN AS WELL AND THEY HAVE PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE IN A PHYSICAL BARRIERS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS SINCE THAT THERE WASN'T ONE WHERE WHERE MEGAN WENT INTO THE NO THERE IS NOW
YEAH AND DAWN WHITTAKER DID YOU MENTION THAT BEING ABLE TO SWIM IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT THAT IS GOING TO PROTECT YOU BUT THERE ARE AN AWFUL HAVE HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU LEAVE PRIMARY SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO I THINK IT AT THE MOMENT IN THE U.K. THIS TO SIT SIX OBVIOUSLY VARY AND LEE
THE FIGURE WE WERE HEARING ABOUT AT THE LAUNCH LAST NIGHT WAS AROUND FIFTY PER CENT OF CHILDREN THAT LEAVE PRIMARY SCHOOL CANNOT SWIM AND IN THE U.K. IT IS AN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AT KEY STAGE TWO THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO SWIM SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS THIS ISSUE
AND DOES ALL THAT TO ING INCREASE THE ABILITY TO SWIM BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE EDUCATION AROUND WATER SAFETY AWARENESS THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT DAWN WHITAKER THANK YOU AND JACKIE ROBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US AND THE WEATHER FORECAST NO JOHN
JOHN IT WAS A RECORD WARM WINTER BUT IT LOOKS LIKE EARLY MARCH COULD BE COLDER THAN ANY OF THE PRECEDING THREE MONTHS WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND IT CERTAINLY IS A VERY CHILLY PROSPECT FOR MUCH OF THE REST OF THIS WEEK ALTHOUGH BRIEF MILDER INTERLUDE JUST NOW

I THINK THE WHOLE BILL IN ITSELF IS DOOMED FROM THE OUTSET IT'S ALMOST UNENFORCEABLE I THINK THEY'VE CREATED A VERY BIG PROBLEM TO THEMSELVES AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERESA MAY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE INTERNET WORKS BUT I'M FULLY BEHIND THE IDEA OF PROTECTING THE COUNTRY PROTESTING AGAINST TERRORISM BUT WE'VE ALREADY GOT MEASURES IN PLACE WHICH MEAN THE GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY DATA THEY WANT FAR A WARRANT THAT ALREADY WORKS
MACEDONIA HAS DEFENDED THE USE OF TEAR GAS AGAINST HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE COUNTRY FROM GREECE YESTERDAY THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN GREECE AND SEVERAL COUNTRIES ALONG THE ROUTE NORTH INTO GERMANY IMPOSE NEW BORDER RESTRICTIONS TEN DAYS AGO ONE SENIOR UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL CONDEMNED WHAT HE CALLED A RISING ROAR OF XENOPHOBIA OUR CORRESPONDENT DANNY SAVAGE REPORTS FROM THE BORDER

FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR ARE ESTIMATED TO DIE EARLY IN THE U.K. BECAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION UNDER E.U. LAWS THE AIR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED BY TWENTY TEN IT WASN'T SO THE SUPREME COURT TOLD MINISTERS TO PRODUCE A PLAN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

BUT THERE IS AN INFINITELY BIGGER STORY IN EUROPE THAT IS THREATENING TO TEAR THE E.U. ITSELF APART UNCONTROLLABLE MASS MIGRATION ON A SCALE THE CONTINENT HAS NOT SEEN SINCE THE END OF THE WAR SEVENTY YEARS AGO BIGGER ON EVERY LEVEL WE HAD ANOTHER GLIMPSE YESTERDAY OF THEIR DESPERATION DRIVING SO MANY OF THE MIGRANTS FORWARD WHEN THEY TRIED TO SMASH DOWN THE RAZOR WIRE FENCE THAT'S BEEN HASTILY BUILT BY MACEDONIA TO TRY TO STOP THEM CROSSING OVER FROM GREECE A CORRESPONDENT DANNY SAVAGES ON THE BORDER WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT

MAINLY SYRIANS IRAQIS WHO HAVE THE PAPERWORK TO PROCEED NORTH THROUGH THE BALKANS THROUGH AUSTRIA TO GERMANY WHICH IS WHERE THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO BECAUSE THE DOORS OF GERMANY ARE STILL OPEN TO THE MIGRANTS AND THEY ARE BEING HELD AT THE BORDER BETWEEN GREECE AND MACEDONIA MACEDONIA SAY THIS IS BECAUSE RESTRICTIONS PLACED BY OTHER COUNTRIES FURTHER NORTH ON THE MIGRANT ROUTES I'VE BEEN PASSED ON TO THEM SO THEY'RE NOT OPENING THEIR BORDERS TO ALLOW PEOPLE THROUGH
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE MIGRANTS AT THE BORDER WITH GREECE OR MACEDONIA ARE GROWING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY AT BEEN HELD FOR SO LONG AT THIS POINT THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR TEN FIFTEEN DAYS SOME OF THEM
AND SO IT BOILED OVER YESTERDAY THEY CHARGE THE GATE THEY BROKE THE GATE TOWARDS MACEDONIA AND TEAR GAS WAS FIRED AT THEM WITH CHILDREN CAUGHT UP IN THAT TEAR GAS FIRING AS WELL THAN SUMMER NIGHT NINE OR TEN CHILDREN AT LEAST WERE TREATED BY THE DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS MEDICS ON THE SITE FOR THE EFFECTS
OF TEAR GAS YESTERDAY NOW I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ONE PERSON WHO WAS THERE HE'S AT THE CAMP HIS NAME IS SAM AND A CRUMB HE'S TRAVELLED TO THE BORDER CAMP FROM HER
THEY CAME WITH THE DEGUS THEY OURS RUN AWAY SOME OF THEM AS A CHILD WITH THEM
THE CHILD'S IN HOSPITAL YOU'RE IRAQI DO YOU HAVE PAPERS TO GO NORTH GERMANY YEAH THEY GAVE ME IN AND THEY STAMPEDE
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT GETTING THIS FAR I SPEND SIX THOUSAND EURO FROM
HERE WITH MY FAMILY I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR A TIME WITH THE BOAT IN THE SEA
FOUR TIMES TRY FIRST TIME THEN CAME SO TEN IS THAT BECAUSE THE BOAT IS SINK SOME PEOPLE IN EUROPE YEAH DO NOT WANT YOU HERE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND I KNOW THAT I DON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME BAD PEOPLE THEY CAME WITH US BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET TO GERMANY I'M NOT GOING FOR A JOB I'M JUST WANT TO BE SURVIVED BECAUSE IN MY COUNTRY I WAS
MY BROTHER'S BEEN KILLED NEXT TO ME BY DASH SNAPPER SO MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED MIGHT MY FAMILY'S BEEN
EXPLOSION BUMPER BEEN KILLIN IN COCOA SO HE'D NOT SURVIVING
OTHERWISE YOU DIDN'T CAME TO WE DIDN'T WANT TO COME EUROPE SO I DID BLAINE US IF YOU DON'T GET ACROSS THE BORDER HERE YEAH WHAT DO YOU TRY GOING A DIFFERENT WAY YEAH SMUGGLING BUT IT'S MUCH TOO MUCH MANAGED THREE THOUSAND EURO I DON'T HAVE FAITH IN THIS TIME
WELL THAT WAS TALKING TO DANNY SAVAGE ON THE MACEDONIAN BORDER THE THE NEW BORDER CONTROLS ACROSS EUROPE WERE NOT PART OF THE E.U. PLAN THE FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IS AT THE HEART OF THE E.U. PROJECT THE SINGLE MARKET WITHOUT BORDERS HENCE THE SHANK AN AGREEMENT
NOW ALL THAT SEEMS TO BE COLLAPSING LORD MANDELSON IS THE EUROPEAN UNION FORMER TRADE COMMISSIONER HE'S MAKING A SPEECH THEY WARNING OF THE THREAT TO BRITAIN'S TRADE FROM VOTING TO LEEDS DO YOU WELL WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE BUT FIRST LORD RANDALL MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THE REFUGEE CRISIS WHAT IS THE ANSWER WHAT SHOULD THE EUROPEAN UNION NEEDS DOING
IT'S CERTAINLY HORRENDOUS AND IT'S VERY VERY HEART RENDING AND UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE AND AND THE SOLUTION TO THIS IS NOT JUST THROW UP NEW FENCES IN NEW WALLS THAT IN ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION WHAT WE NEED
IN EUROPE IS A MUCH STRONGER SYSTEM TO POLICE THE EXTERNAL BORDER OF EUROPE WE HAVE TO DO EVEN MORE TO HELP AND SUPPORT THE REFUGEES WHO ARE COMING FROM SYRIA AND IRAQ
BUT ALSO THE E.U. MUST WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHERS UNITED STATES RUSSIA TURKEY AND OTHERS TO TACKLE THE FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL CRISIS WHICH IS THE HEART OF THIS HUMANITARIAN DISASTER BUT IF YOU WERE IN GREECE AT THE MOMENT FOR INSTANCE AND YOU COULDN'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN INTO THE SQUARES AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS REALLY UNDER THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS WHO ARE ALREADY THERE YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT SIXTY THOUSAND HAVE COME
IN THE PAST EIGHT WEEKS AND YOU WOULD SAY THAT A STRONGER SYSTEM TO COPE GOOD HEAVENS THAT'S PRECISELY WHY WE NEED TO GIVE HER VERY VERY MUCH MORE HELP AND SUPPORT TO GREECE TO HELP WITH THE REGISTRATION OF THOSE WHO ARE COMING INTO AND TO MANAGE THEM AND TO SETTLE THAN TEMPORARILY WE ALSO BY THE WAY HAVE TO REMOVE AND EXPEL PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT GENUINE REFUGEES WHO ARE NOT
A GENUINE ASYLUM SEEKERS AND OF COURSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT WE CONTINUE TO AID TURKEY AND OTHERS TO CREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE CAN BE LOOKED AFTER NEARER
NEARER IN IRAQ AND THAT MEANS PRIMARILY IN IN IN TURKEY BUT EUROPE REALLY IT IS GRAPPLING WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS I FEAR THAT THIS SORT OF CRISIS IS GOING TO GROW AS THE MIDDLE EAST
AND BECOMES MORE VOLATILE DUNDEE AND THE POLITICAL PROBLEMS THERE AND THE SECTARIAN WARFARE ESCALATES YOU EUROPE IN THE FUTURE HAS GOT TO DEVISE A MUCH MORE ROBUST WAYS OF CREATING SAFE
AND LEGAL ROUTES FOR REFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS ALSO AS I'VE SAID TO MAINTAIN ITS EXTERNAL BORDER AND POLICE THAT AND TO RECOGNISE THAT WHILST GERMANY HAS DONE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT AND TAKEN ON A HUGE BURDEN
THERE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE REST OF US WE CANNOT CREATE A SITUATION IN WHICH GERMANY ALONE HE'S BEING SO LARGELY EXPECTED TO COPE BY ITSELF AND YOU COULD ARGUE COULDN'T CHEW WITH THAT IN FACT IT WAS IN PART GERMANY'S FAULT
DEAL OF THE BLAME MUST REST ON GERMANY BECAUSE OF WHAT MISSUS MERKEL SAID LET THEM ALL COME ANYBODY FROM SYRIA WHO WANTS TO COME COME CAT CAN COME TO GERMANY AND THAT RAISES THE QUESTION WHERE WHETHER EUROPE DOES HAVE THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP TO DEAL IT WAS MY
LIKE THE REST OF US IN EUROPE AND CERTAINLY LIKE BRITAIN GERMANY IS A MORAL NATION AND MISSUS MERKEL BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS EXERCISING A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AND I'M NOT GOING TO CRITICISE BUT SHE WAS WRONG WASN'T THAT IT WOULD IT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
YOU FACED WITH THAT SITUATION IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHERWISE LOOK WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AND WE'VE ALL GOT TO PULL TOGETHER AND TO FIND AN IT'S DIFFERENT SORTS OR PARTS OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS I'M GLAD THAT BRITAIN HAS AGREED TO TAKE
TWENTY THOUSAND SYRIAN REFUGEES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I SUSPECT THAT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH I'M GLAD THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING A TURKEY IN THE OTHER RELIEF AND RESETTLEMENT EFFORTS I SUSPECT WE WILL HAVE TO DO MORE
LET'S TURN TO THE REFERENDUM HERE AND THE POLITICS OF FEAR AND YOUR CRITICS SAY YOU WHO SUPPORT STAYING IN THE EUROPEAN ARE RIGHT AREN'T THEY WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS OF FEAR PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE AND SOME OF THE SCARE STORIES THAT YOU'RE SPREADING ABOUT HOW WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY COPE OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN
HAVE YOU READ MY SPEECH YES I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT THIS MORNING AND VERY INTERESTING ISSUES TO HOWEVER I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT A STEWARD AND READ THAT ALL IT DOES IN THE SENSE THERE IS NO SCAREMONGERING IN THAT SPEECH I DIDN'T EXACTLY GILL A SANDWICH AND I WOULD SAY SUBSTANTIAL THOSE SPEECH WHICH ADDRESSES THE RISKS AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR BRITISH BUSINESS AND BRITISH JOBS HAVE ARE LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION IN MY VIEW THE GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY
AND TO GIVE PEOPLE THE FACTS AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S DOING THAT LET'S HUNT AS WELL I LOVE THE FACT THAT I LOOK AT THEY CAN'T SOLDIERS IN HER ON THAT BUT THEY GOT FACTS AT THIS STAGE COME TO BECAUSE SO MUCH SURMISE INVOLVED IN THIS WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT OF COURSE THAT IS A GREAT DEAL OF CERTAINTY LEGALLY IF WE LEAVE THE U.N. INCLUDED BECAUSE THAT IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY EQUALLY WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU STAY INSIDE
WE CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN BECAUSE SHOULD WE LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE WILL BE HEADING IN A COMPLETELY UNKNOWN DIRECTION AND TAKING AN UNKNOWN ROUTE NO COUNTRY HAS LEFT THE EUROPEAN UNION BEFORE BUT I THINK THAT
HE IS AS A FOVEA TRADE SECRETARY IN BRITAIN AND AS A FORMER EUROPEAN TRADE COMMISSIONER I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SET OUT WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT I THINK WILL BE WHAT ARE THE FACTS UNDERPINNING THE DIFFERENT CHOICES WE HAVE AND IT'S
CLEAR TO ME I REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POLITICAL AIMS OF THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL UNDOUBTEDLY DAMAGE BRITISH BUSINESS BRITISH JOBS AND BRITISH IN INVEST THE INVESTMENT BUT THE POINT ABOUT TED LEAVE CAMPAIGNERS
IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY NOT GIVING AN ANSWER TO WHAT OUT WOULD LOOK LIKE WHAT WHAT SITUATION WOULD WE BE IF WE WERE NOT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND I THINK THE REASON THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE TALL
BETWEEN THEIR OBSESSION WITH WHAT THEY CALLED BRITAIN'S AUTONOMY BRITAIN'S INDEPENDENT SOME WOULD SAY ICE A NATION ON THE ONE
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO ON AND THEIR DESIRE TO PRETEND THAT WE WILL NOT LOSE TRADE AND JOBS AS A RESULT OF LEAVING NO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS AND THEREFORE WHAT THEY'RE DOING INSTEAD IS DUCKING THE ISSUE OR SAYING DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES ONE MINUTE THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE CAN BE LIKE NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND WITH THEIR VERY CLOSE ASSOCIATION
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION SO CLOSE THAT NORWAY ACCEPTS ALL THE RULES AND LAWS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION PAYS INTO THE E.U. BUDGET WITHOUT HAVING ANY SAY OF COURSE OVER THE MAKING OF THOSE RULES SWITZERLAND TO A LESSER DEGREE BUT STILL VERY CLOSE SO THAT'S ONE A SORT OF MODEL WITH THEN THEN THEN THE ONE I AM ADDRESSING IS THE ONE
NIGEL LAWSON AND SUDDENLY CAME UP WITH ONE IT'S NOT BE LIKE NORWAY AND SWITZERLAND LET LET'S JUST HAVE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT EXACTLY AND LET ME JUST LET ME GO TO FREAK AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER AGREEMENTS THE UNITED STATES AUSTRALIA THEY'VE CONCLUDED IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS SWITZERLAND CHINA F.T. NEGOTIATED IN JUST OVER TWO YEARS NINE ROUNDS OF NEGOTIATION BETWEEN YOU AND THIS THE FACT IT BETTER AND YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A TRICK
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THE AGREEMENTS EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED A VERY LIGHT AGREEMENTS INDEED IT IN E.D. IT CAN START A TRADE AGREEMENT
THE QUESTION IS WHERE DOES IT END UP WITH THE IDEA OF SELLING I'M FROM THE COUNTRY BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN DEAL WITH TARIFFS RELATIVELY EASY WHAT IS MUCH HARDER TO DEAL WITH ARE THE BEHIND THE BORDER REGULATE TREE BARRIERS
AND THE MORE YOU WANT TO REDUCE BOTH BORDER TARIFF BARRIERS AND REGULATE TREE BARRIERS THE LONGER AND MORE COMPLEX IT IS AND THE HARDER THE NEGOTIATION IS AND THAT'S WHY ON AVERAGE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT TAKES BETWEEN SORT OF SHOULD HAVE FOUR AND SEVEN YEARS SOME TIME OFF YOU GO CHEF YOU MENTION LORD LAWSON AND HE MAKES THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT OUR TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD REMAIN TOTALLY UNTRUE IT WOULD REMAIN TOTALLY UNCHANGED BECAUSE
THE UNION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DID NOT NEGOTIATE AS THE EUROPEAN UNITS A LOTUS NOT A MEMBER OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION NEGOTIATED ON BEHALF OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES ALL OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED THAT'S THE LEGAL POSITION HE MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR
NO IT'S NOT THE LEGAL POSITION AND IT'S ABSOLUTE RUBBISH OF COURSE OF COURSE THE E.U.
IT REPRESENTS THE E.U. MEMBER STATES IN THE W.T.O. I KNOW I REPRESENTED THAT TOOK PART IN ALL THE W.T.O. MINISTERIAL MEETINGS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND THE WHETHER IT BE THE WORLD TRADE ROUND ALL THE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS THAT WE NEGOTIATE
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION THE COMMISSION HAS THE COMPETENCE IT HAS THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY IT HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO UNDERTAKE THOSE NEGOTIATIONS THE AGREEMENTS WHEN DEGRADED THEN LODGED AT THE W.T.O. AND THEY BECOME Y. U. AGREEMENTS THEY DO NOT PICK ALL RIGHT BRITISH SPANISH OR ITALIAN WELL THERE WE GO SO NOT NIGEL LAWSON NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT IS WRONG THERE WE GO HE'S ENGAGING I'M AFRAID IN FANTASY POVERTY WE NEED MORE FACTS UNLESS THAT INVITE US TO YOUR NEXT LUNCH WITH NIGEL LAWSON PETER THERE'S EXTRA LITTLE OLD RECKONED AWESOME THANK YOU SO MUCH
THE TIME IS TWENTY FOUR MINUTES PAST EIGHT IT IS SUPER TUESDAY THE BIGGEST DAY YET IN THIS YEAR'S U.S. PRESIDENTIAL RACE TWELVE STATES VOTING REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES FOR DONALD TRUMP AND HILLARY CLINTON THIS IS THE DAY THEY HOPE WILL MAKE THEIR NOMINATIONS AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES LOOK OVERWHELMINGLY LIKELY ALTHOUGH THREE OR FOUR REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS BERNIE SANDERS INSISTS THAT THEY CAN STILL TRIP THEM UP JIM IS WATCHING THE SCENE FOR US FROM WASHINGTON
THE OLD POST OFFICE BUILDING HERE ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IS A TOWERING PIECE OF AMERICAN GOTHIC IN STONE AND FROM THE TOP OF ITS TOWER YOU CAN LOOK DOWN ON THE WHITE HOUSE ONLY FIVE BLOCKS AWAY
IT'S A BIT OF A BUILDING SITE AT THE MOMENT AND A SIGN OUTSIDE TELLS YOU WHY
TRUMP COMING TWENTY SIXTY IT'S HIS NEW HOTEL
YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THIS DAY IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW IT FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND YOU ARE GOING TO SAY THAT YOU WERE THERE AT THE BEGINNING WE HAVE AROUND US SCIENCE IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE AROUND US
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMP IS THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A CONSERVATIVE WHO BELIEVES IN THAT MAD A SONY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT TRUMP IS ESSENTIALLY AN AUTHORITARIAN WHO DISMISSES ALL OF THAT TALK IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE CARTOUCHE AND HAVE THE BILL OF RIGHTS WITH ANY RESPECT HE DOESN'T RESPECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HE DOESN'T RESPECT MOST AMENDMENTS FRANKLY AND IT'S ONE OF THESE DISHES THAT HAS REALLY BEEN A SURPRISE I THINK TO A LOT OF IDEOLOGICAL CONSERVATIVES WHO THOUGHT THAT THOSE THING
VOTE VOTE VOTE
AND THAT'S FROM THE PUBLISHER OF THE FEDERALIST TOUCHSTONE OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THEN DOMINATE SHE FEARS THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO BE STUCK WITH SOMEONE WHO SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE AN IDEOLOGY BUT DRIVEN BY FRUSTRATION AND NOSTALGIA AND HE'S MAKING IT UP AS HE GOES ALONG
DAHL TROUBLES A NEGOTIATOR HE NEGOTIATES FROM THE EXTREMES HE WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING THAT THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO HEAR RIGHT NOW THE AUDIENCE IS REPUBLICAN STILL BE SAYING WHAT THEY WANT HERE AND HE'S GOING TO SHIFT FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO A GENERAL ELECTION SHOULD BE THE NOMINEE RIGHT WHAT ARE THOSE
IN THE REPUBLICAN FOLD WHO WANT TO STOP HIM DO ABOUT IT CANNAE BE
I DON'T THINK AT THIS POINT YOU CAN BE STOPPED I THINK HE COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED EARLIER ON BUT I THINK THAT FRANKLY THAT THE LEADERSHIP OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH HAS SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF ANIMUS FOR SENATOR PRETEND CRUISE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS
REALLY SAW THAT SAR TRUMP AS BEING SOMEONE WHO WAS IN THE SAME QUOTE UNQUOTE LANE AS CRUISE AND THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOT ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WAS A NEGATIVE FOR THEM HAD THEY COALESCED AROUND CRUISE EARLIER I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PERHAPS START UP TRY AND KEEP SOME OF HIS VOTERS AT THIS STAGE HOWEVER IT LOOKS LIKE DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO SUCCEED JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE HE IS LIKELY TO DESTROY MICHAEL RUBIO IN HIS HOME STATE OF FLORIDA AND I THINK IF THAT HAPPENS AT THE IS PRETTY MUCH OVER AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN
WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS THAT YOU'LL HAVE A VERY INTERESTING TIME OF SORTING THINGS OUT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HOW DO I TAKE IT'S A STRANGE PHRASE SORTING IT OUT OR NOT SORTING AND IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE WAKING UP TO THEIR WAKING UP TO A POLITICAL REALIGNMENT I BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT OF AS A CELEBRITY CANDIDACY THAT WASN'T GOING TO GO ANYWHERE HAS TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE PRIORITIES OF A LOT OF AMERICANS AND SPEAKS TO HOW MUCH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS KIND OF IGNORED THOSE VOTERS IN THEIR PREY WORRIES OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS
THEN DOMINIC AT THE FEDERALIST GUARDIAN OF CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES FACING THE PROSPECT OF THE DONALD WHO ME DOESN'T WANT TO SEE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
BUT WHY IS IT HAPPENING LET'S HEAR THE OTHER SIDE STILL INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN FOLD GEOFF LORD WAS A POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR RONALD REAGAN NOW A CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR AND STILL A REPUBLICAN STALWART AND HE'S VERY CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP SO I PUT THESE CRITICISMS TO
I THINK HE IS CONTROL HE WANTS SOMETHING I THINK HE IS PROBABLY NANA DO YOU LOGICAL ON IN OTHER VERSIONS I THINK WHERE THE DIFFERENCE IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY AND HE'S VERY CLEAR THE CONSERVATIVES AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL
VOTING HEAVILY ENDOWED CAN'T THEY
I KNOW HIM I KNOW FOR FAIRLY WELL HE DOES HAVE AND TALKING TO HIM OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS OFF AND ON AND HE IS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE SHAPE THE COUNTRY'S HIM AND WANT TO DO IT I MEAN I HAD TOTAL CONFIDENCE HE WOULD PUT SO CONSERVATIVE LIKE AND SCORE YOU THE ADAMANT ON THE SUPREME COURT
ABSOLUTELY HOW SERIOUS THIS IS ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT OH BARRY
JERRY DOES HE BELIEVE HE WILL BE YES I THINK IT DOES AT THIS POINT I THINK HE DOES I THINK INCREASINGLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DO WHAT'S THIS WHAT THIS SOME PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY YOU'RE GOING A BIT CRAZY AT THE MOMENT
AND WHAT DO THEY DO ABOUT IT WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CAN DO AT THIS POINT
PRECISELY GEOFF LORD IN THE TRUMP CAMP POSING THE QUESTION THAT ON THIS MORNING OF SUPER TUESDAY IS EXCITING SOME REPUBLICANS

WHEN GEORGE DAVEY SMITH STARTED OUT AS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST IN THE EIGHTIES HE SAYS HE HOPED TO PROVE THAT THE CAUSE OF CORONARY DISEASE IN SOUTH WALES WAS THATCHERISM BUT THE MINERS TALKED TO SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS DOWN TO HAVING A POOR CONSTITUTION AND JUST BAD FORTUNE AND THIRTY YEARS LATER HE WISHED HE'D LISTEN TO THEM HE SPENT DECADES STUDYING WHAT MAKES SOME PEOPLE LEAD HEALTHIER LIVES THAN OTHERS
AND HE'S COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS IS DOWN TO CHANCE DO JOIN ME IF YOU CAN AFTER THE NEWS AT NINE FOR GEORGE DAVEY SMITH LIFE SCIENTIFIC
THE WEATHER CLOUDY LOTS OF RAIN WELL FREQUENT SPELLS ARRAY NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF IT APPARENTLY BUT ANYWAY IT IS GOING TO TURN COLDER LATER YOU'RE LISTENING TO TODAY ON RADIO FOUR WITH JOHN HUMPHRYS AND MICHELLE HUSSEIN TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINETIES AND HAS A SUMMARY OF THE NEWS FIREPLACES ANNOUNCE THAT IT'S PULLING OUT OF AFRICA AND HALVING NEXT YEAR'S DIVIDEND FOR SHAREHOLDERS AFTER REPORTING OR TWO PER FALL IN UNDERLYING PRE TAX PROFITS TO FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS THE BANK IS ALSO CUTTING THE BONUS POT FOR STUFF BY TEN PER CENT
THE FARMER E.U. TRADE COMMISSIONER LORD MANDELSON HAS BACKED THE PRIME MINISTER'S ASSERTION THAT BRITISH COMPANIES WERE FACED YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY IF THE U.K. LEAVES THE EUROPEAN UNION MANDELSON TOLD THIS PROGRAMME THAT BRECHT'S IT WOULD DAMAGE JOBS AND INVESTMENT
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AND MEDICINES ON FRONTIER HAVE CRITICISED THE MACEDONIAN AUTHORITIES FOR USING TEAR GAS ON MIGRANTS TRYING TO CROSS THE BORDER FROM GREECE MACEDONIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS SOLDIERS WERE FORCED TO TAKE THE ACTION TO STOP HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY
THE GOVERNMENT IS PUBLISHING NEW PLAN SETTING OUT POWERS FOR THE POLICE AND THE SECURITY AGENCIES TO MONITOR PEOPLE'S COMMUNICATIONS THE LATEST VERSION OF THE INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL DUBBED AS SNOOPERS CHARTERED BY SOME IS SAID TO CONTAIN MORE PROPOSALS TO SAFEGUARD PRIVACY
THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO NINE IS THE GOVERNMENT FAILING IN ITS DUTY TO BRING DOWN AIR POLLUTION LEVELS IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME AS IT COMMITTED TO DO WHEN IT WAS TAKEN TO COURT BY ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS ARE SUPREME COURT RULING LAST YEAR RESULTED IN A PLAN FOR THIRTY EIGHT ANTI POLLUTION ZONES THEY'D REDUCED POLLUTANTS TO SAFE LEVELS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN LONDON AND TWENTY TWENTY ELSEWHERE BUT THE SAME CAMPAIGNERS THE PRESSURE GROUP CLIENT TURF SAY IT ISN'T SOON ENOUGH AND LEGAL ACTION MAY BE RESTARTED
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT OF THE U.K.'S FORTY THREE AIR QUALITY ZONES WERE FOUND TO BE ABOVE THE REQUIRED LEVEL FOR NITROGEN DIOXIDE EMISSIONS RICHARD DANIEL IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT OF THE B. B. C. LOOK EASTERN HE'S AT AN AIR MONITORING STATION IN CAMBRIDGE THIS MORNING HOW IS IT THERE RICHARD
THE TRAFFIC'S FOR ELIZABETH WAY WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN ROUTES INTO THE CITY
TRAFFIC BUILT UP HERE EVERY MORNING AND AIR POLLUTION IN CAMBRIDGE HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM THEY'VE GOT FIVE MONITORING STATIONS LIKE THIS MEASURING PARTICULATE MOST CRITICALLY NITROGEN DIOXIDE WHICH IS NOW INCREASINGLY BEING RECOGNISED AS A MAJOR THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH
BUT YOU'D BE WRONG TO THINK THAT THIS POLLUTANT IS JUST LIMITED TO A BIG SIS
WE'VE DONE A SURVEY AND MARKET TOWNS AND SURROUNDING AREA AND WENT TO BISHOP STALL
AND ILLEGAL LEVEL ACTION OUTSIDE THAT THEY'RE NEARLY DOUBLE THE ANNUAL MEAN LIMITS OR FORCE YOU MIGHT COULD PER CUBIC METRE
THE PROBLEM NOW A ROAD STANDING TRAFFIC AND THERE ARE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED LOCATIONS LIKE THAT IN THE EAST OF ENGLAND
RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT IS A SNAPSHOT OF ONE A REGION OF THE U.K. BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS ADVISED ON AIR QUALITY BY GROUP OF EXPERTS CHAIRED BY PROFESSOR PAUL MONKS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER AND HE'S IN A LEICESTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING IT'S THE GOVERNMENT VULNERABLE TO THIS CHARGE THAT THE TIMEFRAME EATERS SET TWENTY TWENTY FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN LONDON IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH
I THINK IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT AIR POLLUTION HAS REDUCED GREATLY IN THE U.K. OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME AND THIS IS THE LAST MEASURE TO REALLY DRIVE IT BELOW THIS LEVEL OF FORTY MICROGRAMS FOR ME TO QUEUED FOR FOUR AND TWO SO I THINK THE PAUSES ON THE TABLE
FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW WHICH IS WHERE WE ADVISE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE PROGRESSIVE AND THERE IS A FINITE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO REDUCE POLLUTION THAT RATHER DEPENDS ON HOW AMBITIOUS YOU ARE THE FACTORS THAT FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR DIE PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF AIR POLLUTION SAID THE TIME THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THAT HIS MANY THOUSANDS OF DEATHS BEFORE THEY ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE IS A FINITE TIME AS I SAID THAT IT DOES TAKE TO ACHIEVE POLLUTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MEASURES
WE HAVE TO FOR INSTANCE RETROFIT BUSES WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE EXHAUST SYSTEMS ON BUSES TO MAKE THEM CLEANER THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO TAKE HIM OFF THE ROAD YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT OF SERVICE AND IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU BROUGHT IN SOME OF THE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE THAT CLIENT EARTH SUGGESTED THESE ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNERS AND THEY SAID THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE ESTABLISHING AN EXTENDING SCRAPPAGE SCHEME FOR VEHICLES CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO POLLUTION DIESEL VEHICLE
FOR EXAMPLE GRANTS FOR VEHICLE REFITTING CONSUMER LABELLING SCHEMES ARE VEHICLES AT THE POINT OF SALE THESE ARE THINGS YOU COULD BRING IN THEY COST MONEY OBVIOUSLY BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PART OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AND THEY'RE NOT YEAH I MEAN I CAN'T REALLY COMMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE MEASURES THAT YOU CAN BRING IN I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE SCIENCE THERE
CURRENT POLICY SUGGESTION IS BASED UPON IS SUCH A GOOD SCIENCE THAT DID SERIOUS MODELLING TO HAVE A LOOK AT HOW FAST YOU CAN ACHIEVE THESE AND HOW MANY OF THESE MEASURES YOU CAN BRING IN HOW QUICKLY BUT YOU ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON ON AIR POLLUTION WE LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND WEE WEE FOR EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING ME SAY HOW GOOD IS THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE FACING THESE POLICY DECISIONS ON ABOUT BUT YOU DO YOU DON'T HAVE A ROLE IN SETTING THE POLICY BUT DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT MEASURES SUCH AS THE ONES ON THAT PLANT OTHER SUGGESTING
I THINK THAT'S NOT REALLY FOR ME TO SAY IN ALL HONESTY THAT'S A POLICY BASED DECISION THERE ARE THERE ARE ANOTHER A RANGE OF OPTIONS OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED MAMA WORTH LOOKING AT BUT I THINK THE MEASURES THAT ARE ON THE TABLE ARE REALLY QUITE EFFECTIVE QUITE PROVEN TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON A VERY REASONABLE TIMESCALE
MANY OF THESE ZONES WILL REACH COMPLIANCE MAY WAY BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY SO YOU DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT BY BY TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE GOING TO BE IN IN A VERY DIFFERENT POSITION BUT WHAT IF WE'RE AT FORTY THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR AT THE MOMENT WHAT LEVEL SHOULD IT BE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY OR WILL IT BE
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU EXTRAPOLATE THE NUMBERS DOWN FOR AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS A YEAR THAT COME FROM ANNA TO ESTIMATED THEM IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY OVERLAPS WITH THE NUMBER OF DEATHS OF COME AND P.M. BUT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW WOULDN'T IT IN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SAY FOR SURE WHETHER THESE ARE THE POLICIES THAT WILL
BRING DOWN THE DAY YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THE ISSUE IS THERE ANY LIMIT THIS FORTY MICROGRAMS PER METRE QUEUED WHICH IS THE MOST NOT QUITE A SAFE LIMIT BUT A LIMIT WHERE IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO GET THE ANNUAL MEAN BELOW THAT SORT OF LEVEL AND THE MEASURES MUST ACHIEVE THAT BY BY TWENTY TWENTY PROFESSOR PAUL MONKS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER THANK YOU
IT'S NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE NOW AND BARCLAYS HAS JUST ANNOUNCED ITS RESULTS OF FALL IN PROFITS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG SHAKE UP IN THE COMPANY'S GOING TO SELL HIS BUSINESS IN AFRICA COME ON AHMED IS OUR ECONOMICS EDITOR BEEN TALKING TO THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE COME OUT OF MOURNING

WHEN I VISIT OUR BRANCHES AND GOOD WORK COS ERRORS AND PLACES LIKE LIVERPOOL I SEE AN EMPLOYEE BASE AT BERKELEY IS DEDICATED TO OUR CUSTOMER'S DEDICATED TO DOING THE RIGHT THING
WE WORK VERY HARD EVERY DAY AND I SEE RESPONSES FROM THE BARCLAYS CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE TRUST IS RETURNING TO OUR INSTITUTION BUT WE WILL NEVER REST WE ARE NEVER DIANE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON BUILDING THEIR TRUST EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE WE WILL
MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE WERE STILL A LOT OF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS LITIGATION ISSUES THAT'S LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THEM AGAINST BARCLAYS AND ALSO THE BANK HAS AGAIN TODAY PROVISIONED EVEN MORE MONEY FOR FINES FOR THE MIS SELLING OF PAYMENT PROTECTION INSURANCE OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION POUNDS OVER SEVEN BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL NOW FOR FINES IN THAT AREA
WE ALSO MOVED ON IN OUR INTERVIEW ON TO THE ISSUE OF BRITAIN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND DAILY MADE IT CLEAR WHICH WAY HE THOUGHT THAT VOTE SHOULD GO
I DO BELIEVE THAT HAVING THE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE GREAT ECONOMY OF EUROPE ACRE OF SOME SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO THE CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM WE HAVE A GREAT POSITION IN THE U.K. WE HAVE SOME TWENTY TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IT IS THE ANCHOR OF OUR BUSINESS WE BE IN A BRITISH BANK
AND HAD QUOTED IN LONDON WE THINK IS A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE FOR US WILL BE FINE WE'VE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT WE THINK THE BEST FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CLIENTS IS TO REMAIN PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WE HAD THAT HAPPEN
SO JESS DALEY HIS FIRST REAL ANNOUNCEMENTS TO THE MARKET TODAY HIS FIRST INTERVIEW WITH US AT THE B. B. C. SAYS HE WANTS BARCLAY'S TO BE A SIMPLER MORE HONEST BANK AT THE MOMENT INVESTORS REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED DIFFIDENT SLASHED PROFITS DOWN STILL A VERY TOUGH JOURNEY FOR ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANKS
A QUARTER TO NINE WHEN CAPTAIN HARRY PARKER STEPPED ON A ROADSIDE BOMB IN AFGHANISTAN SIX YEARS AGO HE LOST BOTH HIS LEGS HE DESCRIBED LATER AS BEING QUITE SIMILAR TO LOSING SOMEONE YOU REALLY LOVED NOW HE'S WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT IT NOT A FACTUAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT BUT THE NOVEL AND THE CHARACTERS ARE INANIMATE OBJECTS A TOURNIQUET A BAG OF FERTILISER ABOOT BOOT AND SO ON AND HE'S ON THE LINE GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THIS IS MOST UNUSUAL WHY DID YOU DO THAT

THE WHAT WHAT WHAT THE INSURGENTS AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONFLICT SO YEAH RIGHT WHAT WHAT OH IT'S IN CONCERT WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF THAT WHEN I STARTED TO WRITE ANATOMY OF A SOLDIER I I WAS TRYING TO SORT OF SIDESTEPPED MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND SOME OF THE POLITICS AND BAGGAGE THAT GOES WITH
THE RECENT CONFLICTS IN ARE OFTEN WIN ROCK IN AFGHANISTAN COS I REALLY WANT TO I SUPPOSE THE READER TO MAKE THEIR OWN MIND UP AND I THOUGHT I COULD SAY MORE WITH FICTION SO IT'S THE OBJECTS WERE A WAY OF DOING THAT IN ANATOMY OF A SOLDIER THEY THEY TAKE THE READER THROUGH TIME AND SPACE IN THERE IN THE CONFLICT BUT ALSO RECOVERY
AND THE INSURGENTS THAT OR THAT OR THAT PLANTED THE BOMB THAT INJURED TOM BARNES RIGHT HENCE IN THAT CASE THE BOMB THE BAG OF FERTILISER THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE BOMB OF COURSE THE AND K. CLEARLY APPLIED TO YOU THE BOOT BUT THEN WE GO TO AND I'M SKIPPING AN AWFUL LOT OF OBJECTS THAT OBVIOUSLY BUT WE GO TO THE MOTHER'S HANDBAG EXPLAINED
SO I WANTED TO IN SHOWING THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK IT EACH TIME I SORT OF THOUGHT ABOUT WHICH OBJECT COULD BEST DESCRIBE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I I WANTED TO LOOK AT HOW A MOTHER WOULD FEEL WHEN THEIR SON COMES INTO HOSPITAL AND THEY SEE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME SO THE HANDBAG WHICH FELT LIKE A VERY PERSONAL ITEM WAS A GREAT NARRATOR FOR THAT BUT THERE ARE OTHER OBJECTS IN ANATOMY OF A SOLDIER LIKE THAT THE PERSIAN RUG WHICH NARRATES WHEN THE SOLDIERS AND SOME OF THE LOCAL INSURGENTS SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS CULTURE
IT FELT LIKE A GOOD OBJECT HAD BEEN KNOTTED TOGETHER IN THE NORTH OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD TRAVELLED THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND IT FELT LIKE A GOOD WAY OF DESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT'S OFTEN I MEAN IT'S COMPLETELY ABSURD ISN'T IT JUST NOTICED IT'S NOT ABSURD AT ALL IT'S IT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL AND YOU MUST HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THAT WHEN YOU WERE BECAUSE YOU SAID I THINK IN THAT IN THE PAST YOU'RE NOT A GREAT READER OF BOOKS YOU TERRIBLY AT THE EXPERIENCE IN WRITING SO WHATEVER'S IDEA
WELL I SUPPOSE IT HELPED THAT I HAVE IS MY PRETTY BADLY RED TO START THAT I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE THE LOW BAG IT WAS ONLY AFTER YOU START GIVING IT TO PEOPLE THEY THEY SORT OF TELL YOU WHERE YOU FIT IN OF COURSE
THE VICTORIANS LOVED THEM LOVED WRITING THINGS FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF AN ANIMAL OBJECTS YEAH BUT ANATOMY OF SOLDIERS IT DIDN'T I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF IT IT FELT LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE A SOLDIER AND YOU'RE OUT THERE YOU CARRY ALL THIS KIT ON AND WHEN YOU PUT YOUR BODY ARMOUR ON AND IT STARTS TO SMELL IF YOUR OWN SWEAT
IS THERE SOMETHING SOME OF US SOME RITUAL OR LUCK THAT SORT OF GETS EMBEDDED IN IT AND
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE AN ODD THING TO DO TO DESCRIBE DWARF JACK JUST A FINAL THOUGHT IF I MADE NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THERE WE ARE YOU YOU HAD HUMANISED THE INSURGENTS THAT SHOULD ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO KILL YOU AND YOU SAID YOU WERE NOT ANGRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU WERE INJURED AND YOU WANTED TO SHOW THAT IN THE BOOK AND THAT WILL STRIKE SOME PEOPLE AS REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE
I THINK EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN SOLDIERING I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT IF I IF I WAS IN MY STREET IN LONDON AND AN ARMOURED VEHICLE WENT PAST YOU KNOW FROM A FOREIGN FROM A FOREIGN NATION WOULD I PLANT A BOMB AND I PROBABLY WOULD AND I SUPPOSE I JUST WANTED TO REFLECT THAT IN WRITING AND ASK NEVER SOLDIER
I WANTED TO HUMANISE IT WAS YOU START WRITING CHARACTERISING THE ENEMY OF COURSE YOU'VE HUMANISE THEM WAR IS SO DEHUMANISING
THE BOOK AS YOU SAY IT'S CALLED ANATOMY OF A SOLDIER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HARRY'S MARCUS THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE IF YOU'RE A FAN OF SCANDINAVIAN CRIME DRAMA YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE LATEST ONE TO HIT OUR SCREENS IS TRAPPED CURRENTLY SHOWING ON B.B.C. FOUR THIS ONE IS FROM ICELAND AND THE KEY CRIME SOLVER HE'S THE POLICE CHIEF IN A REMOTE TOWN WHERE A DISMEMBERED BODY HAS BEEN FOUND BY FISHING BOAT IN A FJORD
EXTREME WEATHER PLAYS A STRONG SUPPORTING ROLE AS YOU CAN HEAR IN THIS CLIP WHERE THE POLICE CHIEF ANDREE IS UP A MOUNTAIN IN A BLIZZARD TRYING TO RESCUE A MAN CAUGHT IN AN AVALANCHE

ENJOY IT AND IT FOLLOWS IN THE VEIN THAT SIMILAR VEIN TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE BRIDGE AND THE KILLING PARTICULARLY HOW THE MAIN CHARACTER THE ONE PLAYED BY YOU IS
NOT QUITE NOT QUITE AS TORTURED PERHAPS AS SOME OF THE ONES AT THE OTHER CRIME DRAMAS BUT CERTAINLY A MAN IN A DIFFICULT POINT IN HIS LIFE I THINK WE MADE THE DECISION TO GO TO
YOU KNOW HE'S NOT AN ALCOHOLIC OR ANYTHING SORT OF MORE CLICHED LIKE THAT BUT WHEN HE IS DEALING WITH
WITH BEING A MAN WITH A VERY SMALL TOWN AND BEING PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT SORT OF
OVERQUALIFIED FOR BEING THE POLICE CHIEF IN SUCH A SMALL TOWN BUT ALSO HE'S DIVORCING HIS WIFE AND
OR HIS WIFE WHO STOOD WATCHING HIM I SHOULD SAY YEAH AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AND WRITE HAD RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING AS THE STORY BEGINS AND THIS BODY IS FOUND YOU START TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT EXTREME WEATHER ICELANDIC STANDARDS HE'S ISRAELI LIKE HER BECAUSE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE TARDIS IS HIT BY THIS BY THIS SNOWSTORM WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FILM IN THOSE SORTS OF CONDITIONS IT WAS FANTASTIC I MEAN WE WEREN'T UP NORTH FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO GO

IN APRIL OLIPHANT DIARY ON HAVE SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEVEN MINUTES TO NINE
HOW DOES A TOWEL AND REGAIN ITS REPUTATION IF IT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS A PLACE WHERE YOUNG WHITE GIRLS ARE ABUSED AND RAPED BY GANGS OF MOSTLY ASIAN MEN I'M SPEAKING OF COURSE OF ROTHERHAM WHERE TERRIBLE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED OVER MANY YEARS AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED GIRLS SEXUALLY EXPLOITED LAST WEEK THREE MEN WERE CONVICTED ONE OF THEM GOING TO JAIL SENTENCE OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS THE PEOPLE OF RATHER THEMSELVES ARE CLEARLY ASHAMED AT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
I TO THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ROLL THING THINK ABOUT IS THIS SEX HAS GONE OFF RIGHT REALLY GETS TO ME
IT'S CRAP ALL RIGHT I DON'T HATE IT ROUGH FRENCH CRAPPING IT CLOSELY TEEJAY WICKED TELL IMMIGRANTS I'M SORRY TO SAY IT BUT I DON'T LIKE REALLY RATHER AN THERE'S NOTHING FOR US IT'S NOT FOR US ANY MORE
OBVIOUSLY GROWING IS A HORRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED TO ROVER BUT HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT ALL UP WITH THE COMMUNITY AFTER EVERYTHING CAME OUT COS IF WE CAME TOGETHER AND CHANGE WILL COME FROM WITHIN
CHANGE WILL COME FROM WITHIN US WELL WILL IT I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY DOCTOR JAMES THOMSON WHO'S A PSYCHOLOGIST FROM TRAUMA EXPERT AT U.C.L. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON AND ALSO ON THE LINE BY SERRA CHAMPION WHO IS THE M.P. FOR ROTHERHAM GIVE US A SENSE IF YOU WOULD SARAH CHAMPION OF WHAT THINGS ARE LIKE THERE AT THE MOMENT
THINGS ARE STILL QUITE TENSE TO BE HONEST WHAT I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE TRIAL THAT WE JUST HAD LAST WEEK THE VERDICT FOR AND THAT WAS FOR TWELVE GIRLS SO THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAVEN'T SEEN JUSTICE THERE WILL BE MANY MORE TRIALS MANY MORE TRIALS AND I BELIEVE THAT SOME ARE COMING FORWARD IN THE AUTUMN BUT THE CRIME IS STILL GOING ON NOT ONLY IN ROTHERHAM BUT ACROSS THE TOWN SO I FEEL
VERY PASSIONATE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNISE THAT IT IS A TOWN THAT IS VERY MUCH IN SHOCK I MEAN AS SOON AS THE J. REPORT CAME OUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO WHICH WHICH TOLD US THE SCALE OF THE ABUSE I MEAN WE WERE INCREDULOUS
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING THAT I DID WAS I ACTUALLY GOT ALL OF THEIR FAITH LEADERS AND ALL OF THE VOLUNTARY GROUPS TOGETHER AND WE CAME UP WITH A PLAN OF HOW WE COULD HOLD THE TOWN TOGETHER AND THAT'S REALLY BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO TALK BY LISTENING TO PEOPLE AND CREATING SAFE SPACES RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE CULTURE OF SECRECY THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES AND I CONTINUE SIR ALLOWING PEOPLE TO TALK
CLEARLY PEOPLE TALK ALL THE TIME DON'T THEY BUT BUT IT A PARTICULAR FORUM DO ME YEAH I MEAN WE CREATED SORT OF SAFE SPACES SO TO SAVE SPACE BECAUSE TO MANY PEOPLE IT'S A RATHER OFFENSIVE NOTION ISN'T IT IT WILL BE A PLACE WHERE THE COMMUNITY WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL GROUPS OR SURVIVORS COULD COME TOGETHER
AND SORT OF SHARE WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH WHAT'S GONE WRONG WHERE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE JUDGED AND ALSO IT WAS ABOUT EMPOWERING THE TOWN SO WE WE CREATED A SORT OF HOW TO SPIT SEE THE SIGNS I I STARTED GOING INTO SCHOOLS AND TALKING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT WE FELT WE WERE ACTUALLY PRO ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING TO PREVENT THIS CRIME CONTINUING
DOCTOR THOMPSON YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A SORT OF VERSION OF SOME SORT OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS A LOW KEY ONE ADMITTEDLY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENED IN SOUTH AFRICA FOR A PARTY OF COURSE BUT BUT WHAT'S WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT WHAT I MEAN IS TO EXTEND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD
A CHANCE FOR PEOPLE TO SAY ALL THE THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD NORMALLY NOT WISHED TO SAY OUTSIDE THEIR OWN HOME
FOR EXAMPLE THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO SAY AND ARE QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS THIS IS A PROBLEM CAUSED BY IMMIGRATION BY CULTURES THAT CAN'T GET ON AND FAR FROM COMING TOGETHER WE SHOULD STAY APART
THE PRESCRIPTION WE ARE FOLLOWING HERE IS LET'S GET RATHER UM TOGETHER
BUT THERE'S A CASE FOR SAYING NO CAN'T CAN'T BE DONE RIGHT THIS TIME SO THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION TRUTH STARTS WITH PEOPLE SAYING IN A TOTALLY UNSAFE SPACE THIS IS WHAT I REALLY FEEL
ABOUT THE ASIAN GANGS THIS IS WHAT I REALLY FEEL ABOUT THE POLITICIANS EVEN IF WHAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RACIST WELL I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SORT OF SAY I DON'T KNOW BARRY WHY SHOULD THERE BE ABOUT THIS THERE'S A BARRIER AND IF WE'RE FOLLOWING A BARRIER THEN ALL THOSE PEOPLE AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT SO THAT'S IT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT IT WOULD BE AS FOOLISH
AS WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS TWENTY YEARS AGO SAYING LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT PACKED PEOPLE OFF RIGHT SO IT'S IN VERY CRUDE LET IT ALL I KNOW WELL IT HAS STILL SO IT'S AN UNSAFE SPACE IT WOULD BE REALLY RATHER HORRIBLE TO BE TAKING PART IN IT THERE'S A QUESTION HOW MUCH POLITICIANS CAN DO
BECAUSE RATHER IS MOSTLY LABOUR OTHER PARTS ARE MOSTLY CONSERVATIVE WHEREVER YOU HAVE ONE PARTY IN POWER PEOPLE SAY IT'S ALL THE FAULT OF THAT PARTICULAR PART SO THIS IS WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO TO COMMUNITY LEADERS BUT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS AND COUNSELLORS AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ELECTED COMMENCE LEADERS ARE SOMETIMES RATHER SELF APPOINTED
SO IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW YOU GET THIS PROCESS GOING ON WHERE PEOPLE SAY IT WAS THE TRUTH WE REALLY SPOKE REALLY CONCILIATION WELL PERHAPS
BUT WE'VE STARTED WITH TRUTH RIGHT BECAUSE OFTEN A RATHER HATEFUL PROCESS AND THAT'S THE THING ISN'T IT SEREN CHAMPION AN INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS DOCTOR THOMPSON MADE THEY'RE ABOUT POLITICIANS AND THEIR PART IN THIS PROCESS YES BUT THE THING IS THAT WE DO HAVE TO ADDRESS THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THAT
PEOPLE THERE ARE FOUR OF THE PERPETRATORS WERE PAKISTANI HERITAGE AND TWO OF THEM ARE WHITE WOMEN NEITHER OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DISCUSS ENGAGE WITH LOOK AT CULTURAL ISSUES ABOUT WHY THIS HAS BEEN ABLE TO HAPPEN AND I WAS JUST TALKING TO AN ASIAN WOMAN JUST NOW AND SHE'S SAYING WELL ACTUALLY THIS IS SENT RIPPLES THROUGHOUT THAT THE BROADER AGEN COMMUNITY NOT JUST THE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY TO START LOOKING
YOU KNOW HELL CULTURAL NORMS HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN AREN'T WE AT FAULT IN A SENSE I SAY WE ARE BUT I MEAN AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE THE COOK BECAUSE THERE IS A POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OUT THERE AND FOR A VERY LONG TIME PEOPLE WILL SIMPLY NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAY ASIAN MEN WERE BEHAVING AND WHITE REBEL BABY YEAH AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I FOUND VERY CHALLENGING COS FOR ME THIS IS STRAIGHT CHILD ABUSE IN THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH AS PERPETRATORS
BUT YES I MEAN THE REPORTS HAVE BEEN OUT HAVE SAID THAT THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE HEAD ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW BEING EMBARRASSED ABOUT BEING CALLED A RACIST SHOULD NOT PREVENT YOU FROM PROTECTING A CHILD SENTENCE DOCTOR THOMPSON BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER HER BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER BUT ALSO GIVE THEM MUCH BETTER SOCIAL SERVICES IT'S A TWIN TRACK THEM THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH INDEED DOCTOR JAMES THOMPSON SIR A CHAMPION THAT'S ALL FROM US OUR EDITORS TODAY WERE DAVE MCMULLEN AND ADAM COME A SKI AFTER THE NEWS THE LIFE SCIENTIFIC GOOD MORNING
