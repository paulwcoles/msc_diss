YOU BUT THE COMPANY'S ACCORDING TO THE FINANCIAL TIMES HAVE TOLD SIR JEREMY THAT THE STAFF ARE ALREADY STRETCHED HELPING CLIENTS DEAL WITH THE FALL OUT FROM BRECK'S IT AND WHILE THEY WANTED TO HELP IT WOULD COME AT A BIG COST TO THE TAX
# THE TIME IS NOW COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND M.P.S ON THE COMMONS DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE SAY BRITAIN SHOULD BE DOING MORE MILITARILY AND DIPLOMATICALLY TO REIN IN RUSSIA
JONATHAN BE A LOT HE'S A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT AND JONATHAN THIS OTHER COMMAS OFFENCE LIKE ME WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING SHOULD BE DONE
TO BE HONEST A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING SHOULD BE DONE IS GOING TO BE DONE AT THE NATO SUMMIT SUCH AS PUTTING IN MORE TROOPS ON NATO'S EASTERN BORDER WE KNOW THAT ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND NATO TROOPS WILL BE
PUT IN TO THOSE COUNTRIES LIKE THE BALTIC STATES AND POLAND ON A ROTATIONAL BASIS THAT WILL INCLUDE PROBABLY AROUND FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED BRITISH TROOPS IN THIS STONY THAT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED AT THE NATO SUMMIT WHOM ALSO THIS WEEKEND ALSO THEY WANT THE RENEWAL OF THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT AS A SIGNAL TO RUSSIA
THAT BRITAIN IS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS DEFENCES WE KNOW ALSO THAT THERESA MAY IS ARGUING FOR A VOTE VERY SOON THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON WANTS A VOTE VERY SOON BEFORE THE SUMMER RECESS SO SO THAT'S KIND OF HAPPENING TO THEY ALSO WANT DIALOGUE THEY WANT EXPERTISE RENEWED WITHIN THE M.O.D. AND THE FOREIGN OFFICE THEY SAY THAT THAT HAS WITHERED ON THE VINE RUSSIA EXPERTS VERY FEW IN NUMBER
THAT THEY WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HERE IN THE U.K. A NATO BY RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION YOU CREATES A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE COMMITTEE WANTS A DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA TO BE HONEST YOU ARE STRENGTHENING THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN ON RUSSIA'S DOORSTEP ESSENTIALLY AND TALKING ABOUT DIALOGUE I THINK DON'T GO TOGETHER NECESSARILY BUT WHAT WOULD TODAY SET OUT WHAT THEIR PARTICULAR FEARS ARE ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE IS THE THREAT FROM RUSSIA
THE FIRST THREE FEAR IS IS A CONVENTIONAL THREAT WHICH IS THAT RUSSIA IS EXPANDING ITS MILITARY IT'S DOING THESE LARGE SNAP EXERCISES ON NATO'S BORDERS THIS IMPLIES THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT RUSSIA IS GETTING READY FOR A CONFLICT WITH THE WEST THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT RUSSIA IS USING UNCONVENTIONAL ME DENIABLE MEANS TO TO THAT TO RATTLE ESSENTIALLY
NATO MEMBERS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE CYBER ATTACKS WHAT WE SAW IN UKRAINE WITH LITTLE GREEN MEN ANOTHER WOODS SOLDIERS ON THE GROUND TO A RUSSIAN BUT THEY'D TAKEN TO NORRIE THEY WERE RUSSIAN SO THAT THAT I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST FEAR THAT RUSSIA WILL TRY TO DE STABILISE COUNTRIES ON NATO'S BORDERS EVEN COUNTRIES WITHIN NATO AND THEY'VE DOING THIS ESSENTIALLY YOUR COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT
# BECAUSE RUSSIA BELIEVES IT HAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD STAGE AND WANTS TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF JONATHAN BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX SOME SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND ARE LIKELY TO BE CLOSED TODAY BECAUSE OF A STRIKE BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS RUN ON GEOFFREY'S AS OUR EDUCATION EDITOR WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR THIS STRIKE BREMEN
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN BASICALLY TO MONEY IS GOING ON STRIKE BECAUSE IT'S POINTING AT SPENDING PER PUPIL IN SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND IS GOING TO FALL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY AROUND EIGHT PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY
THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS ARGUES THAT'S LEADING TO PRESSURE ON JOBS WITH JOB LOSSES POTENTIALLY ON THE HORIZON FOR TEACHERS AND SON BEGINNING TO HAPPEN AND THAT THAT IS FEEDING THROUGH INTO CLASS SIZES
AND IT'S ALSO WORRIED THAT THERE'S IN THE CONTINUED PUSH TOWARDS HAVING MORE ACADEMY SCHOOLS WHICH CAN SET THEIR OWN PAY AND CONDITIONS THAT THAT IS LEADING TO AN EROSION OF NATIONAL PAYING CONDITIONER NATIONAL NATIONAL PAPER BUT THE THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THE SCHOOL'S BUDGET THIS YEAR IS GOING TO TOTAL FORTY BILLION POUNDS WHICH MEANS THAT IS THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN
CINDY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPARING APPLES AND PEARS THEY'RE MOUNTAIN OF MONEY GOING TO SCHOOLS IS GOING UP BUT SO IS THE NUMBER OF PUPILS ARE GOING TO BE MORE PUPILS IN ENGLAND SCHOOLS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND AT THE SAME TIME SCHOOLS ARE HAVING TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO TEACHERS' PENSIONS AND LIKE MANY EMPLOYERS PLATE PAY HIGHER NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THAT MEANS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PER CHILD SITTING IN A CLASSROOM
HE'S IN REAL TERMS GOING TO SHRINK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SCHOOL BUDGETS ARE UNDER THE GREATEST PRESSURE THEY'VE BEEN FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS REALLY WHEN THERE WAS THE LAST BIG SQUEEZE ON SCHOOL SPENDING IN THIS KIND OF WAY SO DO WE KNOW HOW GREAT THE IMPACT ON SCHOOLS WILL BE TODAY HOW MANY WILL ACTUALLY BE CLOSED OR WHETHER IT'S JUST A CASE OF INDIVIDUAL CLASS HAS BEEN DISRUPTED
WELL IT'S ONLY TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE N.U.T. MEMBERSHIP WHO ACTUALLY VOTED IN THIS BALANCE ALTHOUGH SUPPORT WAS VERY STRONG AMONGST THOSE WHO VOTED SAYS A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MANY SCHOOLS WERE CLOSE SOME HAVE ALREADY WARNED PARENTS THAT THEY MAY WELL CLOSES DOWN TO THE DISCRETION OF THE HEAD TEACHER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ENOUGH STAFF NOT JUST TO TEACH BUT ALSO TO KEEP THE CHILDREN SAFE THROUGH THE DAY
NICKY MORGAN THE EDUCATION SECRETARY HAS SAID THAT TEACHERS ARE PLAYING POLITICS WITH CHILDREN'S FUTURES BY CAUSING THIS DISRUPTION WE WON'T REALLY KNOW TILL ABOUT MID DAY WHEN WILL GET THE FIRST ESTIMATES FROM THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION ABOUT HOW MANY SCHOOLS HAVE CLOSED CAUSING
# PARENTS ARE COURSE TO HAVE TO MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO HER NICKY MORGAN AT HALF PAST SEVEN BREMEN GEOFFREY'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S NOW QUARTER PAST SIX THE POUND HAS FALLEN BANK SHARES ARE STILL SHARPLY DOWN AFTER THE BRECK IT VOTE CAN MARK CARNEY THEY COME OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOMINIC
O'CONNELL IS WITH US AND THE BUSINESS NEWS AND TO TELL US ABOUT THE LATEST INTERVENTION GOVERNOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL EYES ARE ON CARNE THIS MORNING IT'S A QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT SOMETHING IT'S BEEN IN THE DIARY FOR A WHILE BUT KEARNEY IS EXPECTED TO USE TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT THE RISKS OF THE BRICKS AT VOGUE AND IT SHOWS HOW SERIOUSLY HE'S TAKING IT'S THE SECOND TIME HE SPOKE ON THE SUBJECT
IN LESS THAN A WEEK THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED AS RECOVERED NICELY BUT BANKS EM PROPERLY SHEARS I YOU SAY ARE STILL DOWN AND YESTERDAY STANDARD LIFE HAD TO STOP WITHDRAWALS FROM ONE OF ITS PROPERTY INVESTMENT FUNDS INVESTORS WERE WANTING THEIR MONEY BACK FAST INSTEAD AND I SAID WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SHUT THE DOORS WILL COME BACK TO THAT A LITTLE LATER NO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE WILL SAY
BUT THE MARKET EXPECTS HIM TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BANKS HE'S LIKE YOU TRY AND GET BANKS TO LEND MORE BY CUTTING INTO SOME OF THE RESERVES OF CAPITAL HAVE BEEN TOLD TO HOLD SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CREDIT CRISIS HERE TO TALK THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS WITH US ASKED THE CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR EUROPE THE CHARTER BANK MICHAEL SNAKES THE FINANCIAL SERVICES DIRECTOR AT P. W. C. THERE BUT YOU CAN SEE MICHAEL CAN I START WITH YOU
THIS IS A BIG ABOUT FACE FOR KEARNEY IS AND EVER SINCE THE CRISIS BANKS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO HOLD MORE AND MORE RESERVES AGAINST A RAINY DAY AND HERE IN JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER THE VOTE HE SPINNING ON A SIXPENCE AND TELL HIM TO GO THE OTHER WAY COME ON DOMINIC I THINK IT'S WORTH JUST STARTING TO REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT THE U.K. BANKING SYSTEM HAS BECOME CONSIDERING MORE RESILIENT OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE CRISIS THEY'VE RAISED OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION POUNDS A NEW CAPITAL AND IT'S NOW TEN TIMES BETTER CAPITALISED AND IT WAS RUNNING INTO THE CRISIS
WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS MORNING ON WHAT THE GOVERNOR MIGHT CALL OUT IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT IS A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN A NEW BUFFER THAT WAS INTRODUCED ONLY THREE MONTHS AGO THE COUNTER SICKLE CAPITAL BUFFER THAT BUFFET IS DESIGNED TO BE BUILT UP DURING GOOD TIMES AND RELEASED DURING DIFFICULT TIMES TO LEAN AGAINST ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMY AND ACTUALLY SUPPORT LENDING TO BUSINESSES
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AT THE MARGIN BUT MIGHT BE REDUCED TODAY IF IT GETS REDUCED AT ALL BUT WHY NOW THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THAT THE SUPPLY OF CREDIT A SMALL BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY DOING QUITE WELL INDEED AND THAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT IS WHY THE FINANCIAL POLICY COMMITTEE BACK IN MARCH DECIDED TO INCREASE HIS PUFFER FROM NOUGHT TO NOUGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT WHICH EQUATES TO ROUGHLY FIVE TO TEN BILLION POUNDS OF CAPITAL BUT BACK THEN IN MARCH THEY ALSO CALLED OUT THEY SAW THE BIGGEST NEAR TERM WRIST TO DOMESTIC WRIST TO FINANCIAL STABILITY BEING BRECK'S IT VOTES
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HAS NOW CRYSTALLISE AND I THINK TODAY WE ARE ACTUALLY HERE FROM THE F. F.P.C. SAY WE'VE HEARD SOME RUMINATIONS FROM THE GOVERNOR IN THE LAST WEEK BUT TODAY WILL HEAR FROM THE EPI SEE WHAT THEIR TAKE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT RISK IS NOW IT HAS CRYSTALLISED SIRRAH ON AGAIN DO YOU THINK THAT THIS KIND OF TINKERING AT THE EDGES WITH WITH BENT BUFFERS ACTUALLY HAS MUCH A FIT IN THE REAL WORLD
IT CAN HAVE AN EFFECT I THINK WHAT WE'RE FACING AT THE MOMENT IS AN ISSUE OF CONFIDENCE OR CONCERNS THAT BUSINESS CONFIDENCE MAY PHASE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE MAY FADE AND MARK CARNEY HE'S TRYING TO PRE EMPTY THAT BY INDICATING THAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS READY TO TAKE ACTION MAY WELL BE BY ADDRESSING THIS BUFFER IT MAY WELL BE BY WHEN THE BANK OF ENGLAND MEETS NEXT WEEK DISCUSSING PERHAPS INTEREST RATE CUTS
SO THERE THEY ARE A REAL EFFECTS FROM THAT BUT THERE ARE ALSO HIS HEAD ON ON CONFIDENCE WHICH I'D BE AMAZED BRING UP A GREAT SOMETHING INTEREST RATE WAS WHAT REALLY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND THAT'S WHAT THEY ASSOCIATE WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION AND INTEREST RATE CUT NEXT WEEK AND PERHAPS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO BY CHRISTMAS
WE THINK THAT THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK AND THEY'VE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION AND CONNIE LAST WEEK CERTAINLY SIGNALLED THAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT MONETARY EASING NOW THEY IN AUGUST NEXT MONTH THEY WILL HAVE A FULL
RANGE OF FORECASTS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THEY ALSO HAVE SOME EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW THE BECKS IT VOTE HAS IMPACTED THE ECONOMY SO FAR WE JUST DON'T KNOW IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOME SIGNALS IN THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAS HAD SIGNALS OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY WE THINK THAT THEY'LL PAUSE NEXT WEEK BUT THEY MAY WELL CUT INTEREST RATES BY TWENTY FIVE BASIS POINTS IN AUGUST WHAT SHOULD WE ALL DO IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT GETTING A NEW MORTGAGE
BUILDING YOUR HOUSE WHATEVER HAS BUYING HAS SHALL WE JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE BANK DOES
WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOUR ADVICE BE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS SENSIBLE TO TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT ACTION IS HE'S TAKEN OF COURSE MARKETS ARE ALREADY ANTICIPATING THAT THERE WILL BE A CUT INTEREST RATES SO THAT'S ALREADY BEING REFLECTED IN CERTAIN MORTGAGE RATES AND YOU CAN GET SOME VERY GOOD DEALS RATES OF PARTICULARLY LOW AT THE MOMENT SO
FOR MOST PEOPLE BUYING A HOUSE IS MUCH MORE ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR LIFE AND SO WHETHER TO DELAY OR WHETHER TO TAKE ACTION QUICKLY I THINK HIS IS MORE A MATTER OF WHAT PEOPLE'S OWN PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AND MICHAEL JUST TO YOU THIS THIS EMPHASIS ON THE BANKS MAY SEEM A BIT STRANGE TO SOME PEOPLE WHY ALL THIS FOCUS ON BANKS
THEY ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR ECONOMY GOING ONE OF THE LESSONS FROM THE JAPANESE STAGFLATION DIP THE LOST DECADE WAS THAT THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO GET THEIR BANKS TO TAKE ANY RISKS WHERE THEY KNOW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I THINK AT SOMETHING AT THE GOVERNOR'S REFERENCE IN THE LAST WEEK AS THE NUMBER OF TOOLS AT HIS DISPOSAL AND ESPECIALLY THE FINANCIAL POLICY COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND ENABLE THE BANKING SYSTEM TO LEND TO THE REAL ECONOMY
SO AS WELL AS INTEREST RATES THEY ALSO HAVE LIQUIDITY FACILITIES THAT THEY MADE AVAILABLE THIS AND TALK IN THE PRESS ABOUT POTENTIALLY RE RUNNING THE FUNDING FOR LENDING SCHEME WHICH WERE QUITE SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE CRISIS IN THE GOVERNMENT LENDING KEEP TO THE BANKS TO PASS FROM CHEAPLY TO BORROWERS SO THERE'S THERE'S A RANGE OF TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MICHAEL SNAPE FROM P.W.C. AND SARAH HUAN FROM STANDARD CHARTED WITH ME NOW TO DISCUSS THAT AND ALL THE MARKETS NEWS OR SOON KNOCKER U.K. EQUITIES FUND MANAGER SCHROEDER'S SO THE FOOTY HUNDRED PUT YOUR ONE HUNDRED HAS HAD A GOOD RUN
SINCE THE BRICKS OF VOTE WHAT PART FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT YES THAT TOOK A STEP BACKWARDS I THINK IT PROBABLY HAD QUITE A LOT TO DO WITH THIS STANDARD LIFE THING WITH THEY HAD TO CLOSE THE DOORS ON ONE OF THE ABYSS WERE PUNS PLEASE TELL US WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT INVESTMENT FUND AND HOW SIGNIFICANT IT MIGHT BE
SO IT WAS STUNT LIFE'S U.K. PROPERLY FARMED WHICH IS PRINCIPALLY FUR FOR RETAIL INVESTORS WHO WANT TO INVEST IT IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SO THIS THIS IS REAL BRICKS AND MORTAR OFFICES WAREHOUSES SHOPPING CENTRES AND REALLY IT'S A TWO POINT NINE BILLION POUND FUND
IT WILL HAVE HAD SOME CASH AND SOME PROPERTY SHARES BUT PRINCIPALLY AROUND REAL ESTATE AND WHAT THEY'VE SEEN SINCE BREAKS IT IS THAT SOME INVESTORS WANT TO TAKE THE MONEY OUT
AND THE CASH HER HAS RUN DOWN AND THE SHARES HAVE PROBABLY BEEN SOLD AS WELL WHICH IT HAS HAD A KNOCK ON IMPACT INTO SHARE PRICES IN THAT AREA OF THE STOCK MARKET
BUT WHAT YOU CAN'T SELL QUICKLY A BRICKS AND MORTAR REAL ESTATE PARCELS AND SO THEY HAVE GATED AT THE FLAT I'M SO CLOSE TO IT TO FURTHER REDEMPTION
AND SAID THAT INVESTORS HAVE TO WAIT TWENTY EIGHT DAYS ON A ROLLING BASIS BEFORE THEY CAN SEE IF THEY CAN GET SOME THE PROBLEM MORE AS IT'S VERY HARD TO SHIFT AN OFFICE BLOCK OVERNIGHT HAD TO SELL LIKE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY A DEEPLY WORRYING IT IS IT'S QUITE A LIQUID ASSET THAT THE RISK IS AND THE FEARS THAT CAN SPREAD
IS THAT A NUMBER OF INVESTORS WILL START TO THINK ABOUT TAKING THE MONEY OUT TO WHO HADN'T PREVIOUSLY JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN'T NOW WE'LL NEED SOME LIGHT RELIEF AND IT'S ALWAYS PRESENT IN THE SHAPE OF
# DOMINIC'S REPEL THE WALTER MITTY ISH CHARACTER WHO BOUGHT B.H.S. FROM SIR PHILIP GREEN FOR A POUND I NEED TO SEE IT TO CRACKS INTO ADMINISTRATION NOT LONG AGO NEWSNIGHT LAST NIGHT HAD THE FIRST BROADCAST INTERVIEW WITH THEM AND HE MADE IT CLEAR WHO HE BLAMES FOR B.H.S. HAS PROBLEMS

# THERE'S BEEN A STEEP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF IDENTITY THEFT CASES IN THE U.K. THE FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICE FRANCE SAYS THAT ALMOST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VICTIMS LAST YEAR A RISE OF FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT ON THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS IT'S WARNING THAT CRIMINALS ARE INCREASINGLY USING SOCIAL MEDIA SITES TO FIND PERSONAL INFORMATION
# FOREIGN CLOTHING COMPANIES ARE REVIEWING THEIR INVESTMENTS IN BANGLADESH'S HUGE GARMENT INDUSTRY FOLLOWING FRIDAY'S DEADLY ISLAMIST ATTACK IN WHICH TWENTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED THE SWEDISH CHAIN H.&M. IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RELOCATE ITS OPERATIONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES TO SEVEN THE FIRST WHITTLING DOWN OF THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE BY THEIR FELLOW M.P.S BEGINS TODAY AFTER A HUSTINGS LAST NIGHT WHERE THE FIVE CANDIDATES SET OUT THEIR CASE NORMAN SMITH IS OUR ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR HOW SOON WILL WE KNOW WHICH OF THOSE FIVE HE'S GOING TO DROP OUT NORMAN WE SHOULD FIND OUT THIS EVENING JUST AFTER SIX O'CLOCK AND THE TUSSLE EMERGING FOLLOWING LAST NIGHT SEEMS TO BE FOR
WHO WILL TAKE ON THERESA MAY AND THAT SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING TO STRAIGHTFORWARD TUSSLE BETWEEN ANDREA LEAD SOME AND MICHAEL GO WITH MANY M.P.S TAKING THE VIEW THAT MOMENTUM IS BEGINNING TO BUILD BEHIND ANDREA LEAD SOME AS THE MOST LIKELY CHALLENGER IN PART OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE VIEW THAT MICHAEL GO HAS BEEN FATALLY DAMAGED BY HIS ACTIVE FRATRICIDE AGAINST BORIS JOHNSON BUT MORE THAN THAT I THINK
THERE IS A SORT OF TIME IN A MOMENT IN THESE CONTESTS WHEN A DIFFERENT A NEW CANDIDATE CAN OF THEMSELVES DEVELOP MOMENTUM BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BRUISED A WHOLE LOAD OF EGOS IN THE PAST I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOAD OF BAGGAGE PEOPLE CAN INVEST THEIR OWN SORT OF HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS IN THEM AND I THINK ANDREE LETS HIM AS DEFINITELY BENEFITING FROM THAT IS THE SORT OF
CHANGE CANDIDATE IF YOU LIKE MORE THAN THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOMINATIONS GRADUALLY BEGINNING TO PULL AHEAD OF MICHAEL GO VERN SHE'S PICKED HERSELF QUITE CLEVERLY AS THE SORT OF TORY RADICAL CANDIDATE PROMISING TAX CUTS FOR THE LOW PAID TAKING ON EXCESSIVE BOARDROOM SALARIES ENHANCED WORKERS' RIGHTS TO SORT OF COUNTER
MICHAEL GOES PITCH AS THE CANDIDATE OF CHANGE AND TELLINGLY AND SOME OF HER SUPPORTERS ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE THERESA MAY CAMP ARE NOW THINKING ABOUT LENDING SOME OF THEIR VOTES TO MICHAEL GO TO TRY AND STOP HER GETTING ON THE FINAL BALLOT BECAUSE THEY SEE HER AS THE REAL THREAT NOW THERESA MAY'S CAMPER ADAMANTLY DENYING THAT BUT I THINK IT UNDERLINES THE SORT OF EMERGING DYNAMIC WHICH SEEMS TO BE WE COULD BE ON COURSE FOR A FINAL SHOWDOWN
BETWEEN TWO WOMEN WHICH WOULD MEAN OF COURSE OUR NEXT PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE A SECOND FEMALE PRIME MINISTER YES BUT THIS BATTLE FOR SECOND PLACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS THOSE FINAL TWO WHO WILL THEN BE PUT TO THE WIDER CONSERVATIVE PARTY MEMBERSHIP THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND ALTHOUGH THERESA MAY SHE SEEMS ON COURSE TO WIN HANDS DOWN AMONGST M.P.S AND DID ONE OF HER BACK AS BACKERS WAS EXPLAINING TO ME LAST NIGHT THAT SHE'S CURRENTLY GOT MORE THAN A THIRD OF M.P.S PUBLICLY DECLARED
BEHIND WHICH MATHEMATICALLY APPARENTLY MEANS IF THEY STAY TRUE SHE WILL GO THROUGH TO THE FINAL BALLOT NOW MY MATHS IS SO SORRY I COULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SHE CERTAINLY GOT MORE VOTES THAN ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES TO OTHER IMPORTANT STRUTS TO HER CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT I THOUGHT ONE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE DAILY MAIL AND WHICH SHE COMES OUT SAYING SHE WOULD PRESS FOR THE RENEWAL OF TIDE AND TRIDENT BEFORE THE SUMMER RECESS
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PLAYS TO HER NARRATIVE AS THE SECURITY CANDIDATE THE SAFETY CANDIDATE IS THE SORT OF STRONG IN THE WORLD CANDIDATE ALSO APPEALS TO THE RIGHT OF THE PARTY PREDOMINANTLY BRECHT'S OR TEARS SECONDLY SHE HAS SECURED THE BACKING OF DAVID DAVIES NOW THAT MATTERS BECAUSE HE HAS A SIGNIFICANT FIGURE IN BRECHT'S AT CIRCLES BUT MORE THAN THAT HE HAS REPEATEDLY CLASHED WITH THERESA MAY OVER CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUE SO TO GET
HIM ON BOARD I THINK IS A SIGNIFICANT QUEUE BUT SHE DOES SEEM ALMOST UNSTOPPABLE IN TERMS OF GOING THROUGH TO THAT FINAL BALLET OF PARTY MEMBERS OR WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE OTHER CANDIDATE STEPHEN CRABB AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS MORNING NORMAN SMITH THANK YOU IT'S TWENTY FOUR MINUTES TO SEVEN AND WHAT HAVE LABOUR WELL IT'S DEPUTY LEADER TOM WATSON HAS TOLD HIS PARTY'S M.P.S THAT HE'LL MEET UNIONS TODAY TO TRY TO REACH SOME SORT OF DEAL ON JEREMY CORBIN'S FUTURE ROSS HAWKINS OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IS HERE WAS WHAT SORT OF DEAL COULD THEY
ARRIVA THAT FRANKLY IS THE QUESTION NOBODY CAN QUITE ANSWER FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL WITH EACH PASSING DAY THE POSITION'S BECOMING MORE ENTRENCHED TOM WATSON TOLD JEREMY CORPORATE WAS PRIVATE MEETING YESTERDAY YOU'VE LOST THE M.P.S AND PEERS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET THEM BACK THEN THERE WAS A MEETING OF THOSE M.P.S AND PEERS IN THE EVENING ONE WAS SO UPSET AT STAKE THE PARTY DURING A SPEECH BY LAW CLINIC SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM CRYING
ANY IDEA OF COMPROMISE THOUGH WHEN YOU PUT TO PEOPLE HOW WOULD THAT WORK THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER NO ONE FRONT BENCH A SENIOR FRONT BENCHERS SETS ME MAYBE JEREMY CORBIN COULD SAY HE'D STAND A FEW MONTHS AND A CANDIDATE WOULD ADOPT PART OF HIS POLICY PLATFORM BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF A DEAL THEY CAN'T EVEN AGREE SOME THE UNIONS I SPOKE TO ABOUT WHETHER THIS MEETING IS ACTUALLY GOING TO
TAKE PLACE TODAY AND SUCH DISTRUST ONE PERSON WAS A KEY PLAYER IN THESE WILL STILL BE THEY WERE RECORDING THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS TO A MEETING IN CASE THEIR WORDS WERE USED AGAINST THEM SUCH ANGUISH ONE RECENTLY RESIGNED FRONT BENCHERS SAID TO ME THAT IF THERE WAS A NO CONFIDENCE VOTE LOCALLY WHERE THEY WERE THEY WOULD WALK AWAY FROM POLITICS THEY HAVE SIMPLY HAD ENOUGH AND THAT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME ON THE REALITY IS
IF THE TRADE UNIONS WERE TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION THAT WOULD CHANGE THE GAME IF THEY DO NOT THE VERY BROAD ASSUMPTION OF WESTMINSTER AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME SORT OF FORMAL LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE MOST PROBABLY BY THE END OF THE WEEK SO THE IDEA THAT WAS RAISED A FEW DAYS AGO THAT THE PARTY COULD SPLIT A PEOPLE INCREASINGLY THINKING THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN YES AND WHAT WAS
SORT OF HOWL OF ANGUISH IN CONVERSATION FROM LABOUR PEOPLE HAS NOW BECOME A COMMONPLACE IT'S MUCH DISCUSSED THAT IF THERE'S A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE AND JEREMY CORBIN WINS WHICH HE COULD SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT A SPLIT IS INEVITABLE THAT M.P.S COULD ELECT THEIR OWN LEADER THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF FORMAL DIFFERENT AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHETHER THINKING
TO M.P.S AND EITHER SIDE OF THESE WALLS CLIVE LEWIS'S CLOSE JEREMY CORBIN JONATHAN REYNOLDS WHO'S VERY MUCH NOT THEY PUBLISH THIS MORNING A JOINT SAME NON LABOUR LIST THE BLOG BEFORE AN EVENT FROM THE COMPASS GROUP TODAY NOT TALKING ABOUT NEW PARTIES OR SPLITS BUT RESTATING A BACKING FOR PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION AND SAYING THE ERA OF TOO BIG PARTIES REPRESENTING THE BULK OF THE COUNTRY IS OVER AND AFTER THE REFERENDUM WE'RE SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRETENDING THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THERE'S A STRAIN OF THINKING THAT EVEN WITHOUT THIS OPEN WARFARE THE FUTURE OF THE LABOUR PARTY WOULD BE UP FOR GRABS IN THE FORCES THAT ARE MOVING TOWARDS IT RADICALLY CHANGING OR EVEN FRACTURING TO NOT START AND END WITH JERRY COOGAN HIMSELF RUSS HAWKINS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS TWENTY ONE MINUTES TO SEVEN IN THE LAST NINETY MINUTES NASA HAS CONFIRMED THAT A SPACE PROBE THAT SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS TRAVELLING TO JUPITER HAS SUCCESSFULLY ENTERED ORBIT AROUND THE PLANET REBECCA MORALE OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT IS AT MISSION CONTROL IN PASADENA CALIFORNIA REBECCA THIS WAS SEEN AS A CRUCIAL MOMENT HOW DIFFICULT WAS THE MANOEUVRE
IT WAS TRICKY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF STRESSED OUT TENANTS LOOKING SCIENTISTS HERE ALL DAY TODAY AND BASICALLY THE SPACECRAFT HAD BEEN TRAVELLING FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION KILOMETRES THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND IT HAD TO SLAM ON ITS BRAKES AND IS GOING INCREDIBLY QUICKLY TO BE SUCKED IN
AROUND JUPITER IT'S GOT AN IMMENSE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD AND HE DID THIS BY BURNING ITS ENGINE FOR EXACTLY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES NOW THE CATCH WAS ALL OF THIS HAD TO BE DONE ON AUTO PILOT IT'S TOO FAR AWAY TO ACTUALLY CONTROL IT FROM HERE ON EARTH SO THE SCIENTISTS COULD MERELY SIT
WATCH IT HAPPENING TO SEE IF IT DID TURN ON ITS ENGINES AS PLANNED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY GOT A SIGNAL BACK TO SAY YES IT HAD BEEN A SUCCESS AND NOW THAT THAT MANOEUVRE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
THE MISSION IS GOING TO LAST FOR THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THIS SPACECRAFT IS GOING TO ORBIT JUPITER THIRTY SEVEN TIMES AND IT'S GOING TO GET CLOSER IN THAN WE HAVE
EVER BEEN BEFORE SO IT'S GOING TO BE SKIRTING OVER THEIR THICK SWIRLING ATMOSPHERE LOOKING AT FEATURES LIKE THE GIANT RED SPOT A STORM THAT'S BEEN RAGING ON THE PLANET'S SURFACE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS IT'S TWICE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH THIS STORM IS TERRIBLE WEATHER
LOOKING
COUNTS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND SEE WHAT'S IT ABOUT THEN IT'S JUST JUST AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TERRIBLE WEATHER REBECCA WE'VE GOT SOME TERRIBLE INTERFERENCE ON THAT LINE APOLOGIES FOR THAT THAT WAS OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT SPEAKING TO US FROM NASA MISSION CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH JUPITER BUT NOT CALIFORNIA IT'S NOW NINETEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND BORIS JOHNSON'S PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ANDREA LEAD SOME IN THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP ELECTION IS THE MAIN STORY FOR THE GUARDIAN
# IT CALLS HIS ENDORSEMENT A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT COUP FOR THE ENERGY MINISTER BECAUSE HE REMAINS POPULAR WITH GRASSROOTS CONSERVATIVES THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE LATEST SURVEY BY THE CONSERVATIVE HOME WEBSITE WHICH GIVES MISSUS LED SOME A SLIGHT LEAD OVER THE HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY
A YOUGOV POLL OF NEARLY A THOUSAND TORY MEMBERS FOR THE TIMES HOWEVER PUTS MISSUS MAY THIRTY TWO POINTS AHEAD OF MISSUS LEADS AND AS THEIR CHOICE FOR PRIME MINISTER WITH SIXTY THREE PERCENT TO THIRTY ONE THE SUN DESCRIBED MISSUS LED SOME TRUSTING SPEECH TO CONSERVATIVE M.P.S AS A RAMBLING PITCH THAT LEFT COLLEAGUES CONFUSED UNDER THE HEADLINE LEAD BALLOON IT'S SAYS SHE LOST THE ROOM WITH BIZARRE TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO MASSAGE BABIES' BRAINS MICHAEL GO OVER DAD'S WAS HEARD LARGELY AND STONY SILENCE WHILE MISSUS MAY WAS GREETED BY LOUD BANGING ON TABLES AND WALLS
IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THE EDUCATION SECRETARY MICKEY MORGAN DECLARES HER SUPPORT FOR MY GO HER PREDECESSOR HAILING HIM AS A WARRIOR FOR THE DISPOSSESSED SHE SAYS HE HAS THE IDEAS THE PASSION AND THE ENERGY THAT THE TIMES DEMAND AN ARTICLE FOR THE EYES IAN DUNCAN SMITH PRAISES ANDREA LEAD SOME DEEP COMPASSION AND REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE
THE DAILY MAIL REMAINS FIRMLY MISSUS MAY'S CAMP UNDER THE HEADLINE MAY IS ON THE MARCH IT SAYS SHE SURGING FURTHER AHEAD WITH THE BACKING OF TEN CABINET MINISTERS AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED M.P.S ARE GRINNING NIGEL FARAGE APPEARS ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE TIMES AND THE TELEGRAPH AFTER HIS DECISION TO STAND DOWN THE DAILY EXPRESS SAYS HE'D BEEN DISTURBED BY DEATH THREATS AND HIS PERSONAL LIFE HAD COME UNDER HUGE STRAIN
BUT MY HIMSELF TELLS THE TELEGRAPH THAT HE WANTS TO DEVOTE MORE TIME TO HIS HOBBIES SUCH AS ANGLING WATCHING CRICKET AND VISITING FRANCE THE SON BELIEVES HE HAS HAD THE LAST LAUGH FOR THE GUARDIAN SAYS WALKING AWAY AFTER WINNING THE REFERENDUM IS A CONTEMPTIBLE ACT THAT SHOULD NEITHER BE FORGIVEN OR FORGOTTEN A LETTER TO THE TELEGRAPH SUGGEST THAT MY PARISH DESERVES TO BE ENNOBLED ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT NOMINATE HIM AS AN IDEAL HOST FOR TOP GEAR WITH BORIS JOHNSON AS HIS SPARKY FOIL
# CHRIS EVANS DEPARTURE FROM THE MOTORING SHOWS THE MAIN STORY FOR THE MIRROR WHICH SAYS THE STY ADMITTED HE'D FLOPPED AFTER VIEWING FIGURES PLUNGED TO AN ALL TIME LOW IT ACCUSES HIM OF RUINING A GREAT PROGRAMME WITH HIS SHOUTY STYLE STEREOS THE HEADLINE IN THE SUN WHICH SAYS THE FORMER FRIENDS ACTOR MATT LE BLANC WILL NOW BECOME THE PROGRAMME'S MAIN HOST
# FINALLY THE TIMES REPORTS ON A BRITISH MISSION TO BOLDLY GO INTO SPACE FOR THE RATHER PROSAIC PURPOSE OF TIDYING UP NOT FOR US TO DRIVE TO REACH THE MOON OR MARS INSTEAD A SPACECRAFT WILL BE LAUNCHED NEXT YEAR TO TEST THREE INVENTIONS FOR COLLECTING THE THOUSANDS OF TONS OF DEBRIS INCLUDING DEFUNCT COLD WAR SATELLITES ORBITING THE PLANET
SCIENTISTS WILL ATTEMPT TO HARPOON THE SPACE JUNK OR CATCH IT IN A NET OR SALE WILL BE ATTACHED TO LARGE ITEMS TO DRAG THEM BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO BURN UP HARMLESSLY IT'S SIXTEEN MINUTES TO SEVEN AND A MAIN NEWS THIS MORNING IS THAT CONSERVATIVE M.P.S WERE CAST THEIR BALLOTS TODAY IN THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING FOR A NEW PARTY LEADER AND PRIME MINISTER
# AT THE LAUNCH OF THE REPORT INTO ANTI SEMITE ISM IN THE LABOUR PARTY LAST WEEK SOME THOUGHT THAT JEREMY CORBIN SCORED A FEW OWN GOALS WELL YESTERDAY HE WAS GIVEN NINETY MINUTES TO REVISIT THE ISSUE A PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT SUSAN HUME WAS PITCH SIDE
MORE THAN SIXTY LABOUR M.P.S HAVE ABANDON JEREMY CORBIN'S SHADOW GOVERNMENT TEAM HE'S BEEN ASKED TO RESIGN THERE COULD BE A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE EARLIER IN THE DAY JEREMY CORBIN SENT OUT A VIDEO MESSAGE COLIN ON HIS M.P.S TO COME TOGETHER BUT LABOUR'S CHUCKLE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE CLICKED ON THE LINK AND SO HE GAVE HIS LEADER A PIECE OF HIS MIND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU AS A LEADER CAN SEND A VERY CLEAR
EVERY M.P. WHO RAISES ISSUES SHOULD BE AFFORDED RESPECT
A PRICKLY CONFRONTATION AS JEREMY CORBIN APPEARED BEFORE THE COMMONS HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT ANTI SEPARATISM IT'S BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST TIME AN OPPOSITION LEADER HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY A COMMONS COMMITTEE BUT THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T DEFERENTIAL CHUCK AT THE MINA TACKLED HIM ABOUT MOMENTUM THE LEFT WING MOVEMENT THAT BOLSTERS HIS LEADERSHIP MY WINNER SIGHTED SENIOR MEMBERS OF MOMENTUM WHO'D MADE ALLEGEDLY ANTI SEMITIC COMMENTS AND THAT WASN'T HIS ONLY COMPLAINT
FRANKLY MOMENTUM IS A PARTY WITHIN A
POSING AS A MOVEMENT WHICH IS WHY MANY OF OUR TRADE UNIONS REFUSED TO FUND IT IN ORDER TO HELP WITH THIS ANTI SEPARATISM ISSUE
DO YOU NOT THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL SIMPLY FOR MEN MOMENTUM TO BE WOUND UP AND SHOP
JEREMY CARBON SOME MOMENTUM IN A FAR CUNDALL AIR LIGHT MOMENTUM IS A PLACE WHERE MANY PEOPLE WHO'VE COME INTO POLITICAL ACTIVITY TO FIRST TIME OR RETURN TO POLITICAL ACTIVITY ARE ACTIVATING THEMSELVES ON HOUSING ISSUES ON TRANSPORT ISSUES ON WAGES SEWS HER MANY MANY MILLION OTHER ISSUES SURELY
THAT DEGREE OF ENGAGEMENT IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY IS A GOOD THING A LOT OF THE SESSION CENTRED ON MY CARBON'S FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE LABOUR CHAIR KEITH VAZ RECALLED THAT HE HAD ONCE INTRODUCED HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS MEMBERS TO A MEETING AS FRIENDS
DO YOU REGARD THEM AS YOUR FRIEND HAS I IT WAS INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE I USED WHICH WITH HINDSIGHT I WOULD RATHER NOT ABUSE THE GENERAL POINT SO YOU WERE USING THOSE WORDS THAT THOUGH I REGRESS USING THOSE WITH AND THEY OR FRANCE I'VE DONE SO MANY AT HOME
JEREMY CORBIN ORDERED THE FORMER HEAD OF LIBERTY CHAMOIS CHAKRA BARTY TO CARRY OUT AN INQUIRY INTO ANTI SCIMITARS AND THE PARTY SHE WAS SITTING JUST A COUPLE OF FEET BEHIND MY CARBON THOUGH KEITH VAZ MADE IT CLEAR HE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE THOUGHT
BUDDY I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN A WITNESS HERE BUT YOU'RE NOT TODAY MISTER CORBIN IS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY
HE IS VERY CAPABLE OF ANSWERING HIS QUESTIONS AND WE PREFER YOU NOT TO KEEP PASSING IMMENSE SHOULD ALSO JOINED HIM AT THE MEDIA CONFERENCE LAST WEEK THAT LAUNCHED HER REPORT ON A ROW BLEW UP OVER MISTER CORBIN'S OWN WORDS AFTER HE'D APPEARED TO EQUATE ISRAEL AND THE GROUP YES ALSO KNOWN AS DIRE ISH KISS THERE AS WANTED MISTER CORBIN'S EXPLANATION
YOU MADE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND
THE CHIEF RABBI DESCRIBE YOUR COMMENTS AS OFFENSIVE AND ALARMING JEREMY CORBIN ARGUED THAT HE HAD BEEN MIS HEARD AND MISUNDERSTOOD HE SAID HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT ALL
I SAID ISLAMIC STATES LOWER CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH HINDSIGHT AND MANY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER WITH HINDSIGHT
AS EVERYONE OF US AROUND THIS TABLE IS WELL AWARE IF I'VE SAID ISLAMIC COUNTRIES
SO WAS THE ANTI SEMITE ISM IN JEREMY CORBIN'S LABOUR PARTY KEITH VAZ AGAIN
DO YOU ACCEPT THAT JEWISH GROUPS AND ORGANISATIONS ARE FEARFUL WITH YOU AS THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE SAID AND DONE SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE REGRETTED TODAY I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME
BUT YOU ARE FOSTERING
A PERIOD IN THE PARTY WERE ANTI SEPARATISM EXIST I THINK THAT'S DEEPLY UNFAIR DEEPLY WRONG IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE LAST THING I WOULD WANT TO DO
BUT A CONSERVATIVE VICTORIA AT CAN STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY JEREMY COBB AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE SITUATION OF DEFENDING HIS CONTACTS WITH MEMBERS OF HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS AND MAYBE HIS REPLY REVEALED SOMETHING ABOUT THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE PARTY YOU HAVE AN UNFORTUNATE HABIT IT SEEMS OF TALKING TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER LEADER OF A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY HAS THIS SORT OF HISTORY
YOU ARE UNUSUAL TO PUT IT BLUNTLY THROUGH IT'S ALL VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY THAT ACTUALLY YOU NEED BOTH OF THEM SORRY GORGON TERMS THAT'S A CONFIDENT YEAH AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PERHAPS AND WEEKS AT LEAST ON CAMERA
# JEREMY CORBIN SMILED SUSAN HERE AND REPORTING AND YOU CAN HEAR MORE ON WHAT HAPPENED YES IN PARLIAMENT HALF PAST EIGHT ON LONG WAVE AND AND DIGITAL IT'S NOW ELEVEN MINUTES TO SEVEN THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CASES OF IDENTITY FRAUD IN THE U.K. FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT MORE WERE REPORTED LAST YEAR THAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN MANY CASES FRAUDSTERS ARE GAINING ACCESS TO PERSONAL DETAILS SHARED BY VICTIMS LIKE JACK WALKER WHO WAS TARGETED WHEN HE TRIED TO BUY A PAIR OF TRAINERS ONLINE
FRANCE I REALISED THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS SO I PAID BY BANK TRANSFER TO TRYING TO AVOID A SEE WHAT SHE COST JUST QUITE NAIVE OF ME AND I HANDED OVER MY DETAILS TO GET THEM POSTED TO AND MAY ALSO HAVE MY DATE OF BIRTH
A MONTH LATER THE TRAINS HAVEN'T ARRIVED AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T ARRIVED AND ER PAYPAL ACCOUNT BEEN SET UP WITH MY DRESS WITH A NEW EMAIL ADDRESS AND IT HAD BEEN FRAUDULENTLY USED SO IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS USING MY CAR WAS CARPALS WHAT INTEREST QUITE
THE FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICE SEE FIRST SAYS SOCIAL MEDIA IS ALSO BEING USED AS A HUNTING GROUND FOR VICTIMS' DETAILS IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS SIMON DUKE'S GOOD MORNING MORNING CAN WE BE SURE THAT THIS IS AN INCREASE IN CASES RATHER THAN AN INCREASE IN THE REPORTING
YES IT'S INCREDIBLY CONCERNING AND IT'S WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING OUR CAMPAIGN TODAY YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE FRAUD AFFECTS EVERYONE AND IDENTITY FRAUD AFFECTS EVERYONE BUT WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIFTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE
OF BEING IN VICTIMS BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ALERT PEOPLE THAT YOUNGER AGE GROUP TO AS YOU SAY SOCIAL MEDIA IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO OTHER CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT BE LOSING I DON'T SO WHEN YOU SAY SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF WAYS THAT THEY
THAT FRAUDSTERS ARE ABLE TO FIND USEFUL INFORMATION ON ON SITES LIKE TWITTER FACEBOOK ET-CETERA FRAUDSTERS ARE ADEPT AT CHANGING THEIR METHODS IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE DEFENCES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE SO IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WENT BACK FIVE YEARS YOU'D SEE THAT FRAUDSTERS IDENTITY FOR THE SORT OF ISLAND FRAUD WE WOULD SEE OVER TEN PER CENT OF IT WOULD BE FAKE IDENTITIES
NOW THAT'S DOWN TO JUST OVER THREE PERCENT AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF FAKE IDENTITIES TO FORCES GOING FOR GENUINE IDENTITIES WHERE THEY GETTING THOSE ARE GETTING THEM FROM SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALSO GETTING THEM FROM ALL THOSE DATA BREECHES HACKS LEEKS
AND THE RESULTS OF ALL THAT INFORMATION FIND THEMSELVES OUT WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE GETTING THOSE DETAILS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA GETTING PEOPLE'S NAMES BUT DO YOU MEAN ADDRESSES DATES OF BIRTH PEOPLE ARE PUTTING ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ON THE SITES OF THE CAMPAIGN LAUNCH TODAY DESSERT A SHORT YOUTUBE CLIP THAT WILL BE ON OUR WEBSITE IDENTITY FOR DOT ORG DOT U.K. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE USED A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTH LONDON SOME HIDDEN CAMERAS
AND WE HAVE AS PEOPLE HAVE GONE IN AND ASKED FOR A COFFEE WE HAVE RESEARCHED THEM ONLINE IN REAL TIME AND WITHIN THREE MINUTES THE TIME IT TAKES TO MAKE A COFFEE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE'S NAMES ADDRESSES DATES OF BIRTH OCCUPATION AND WE'VE PUT IT ALL ON THE COFFEE CUP AND WE'VE HIT WE'VE FILMED THEIR RESPONSES AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF SHOCK YOU JUST SUPPOSE DETAILS IS ENOUGH TO STEAL SOMEONE'S IDENTITY ONLINE IT IS
GOSH SO I MEAN IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME TO TO TO MAKE ONLINE PURCHASES OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE KIND OF THING EVEN HER DATE OF BIRTH IS OFTEN THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU THAT YOU NEED OR YOURS'LL NEED YOUR ADDRESS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE GOOD SCENT BUT OFTEN THEY ASK FOR YOUR DATE OF BIRTH AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE REQUIRED TO PUT IN BUT IT'S IT'S MORE ABOUT
PROTECTING THE INFORMATION MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR FRAUDSTERS SO YES OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT AND WE'RE NOT SAYING AT ALL DON'T USE SOCIAL MEDIA DON'T SHOP ONLINE THIS IS THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR SOCIETY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS BE CAREFUL OF THE IDENTITY DETAILS THAT YOU SHARE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE IS UP TO DATE AND I KNOW THAT'S
FOR SOME PEOPLE TRICKY BUT YOU KNOW GO TO MONEY SAVING EXPERT DOT COM AND THEY'VE GOT A LIST OF RECOMMENDED FREE ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE BE CAREFUL MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT GOOD PASSWORDS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTS DON'T USE PUBLIC WIFE FIVE FOR BANKING USE IT FOR BROWSING THOSE SORT OF THINGS AND YOU DO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA CANCEL I'LL SET APPROPRIATELY SIMON DUKE'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT'S COMING UP TO SIX MINUTES TO SEVEN WHEN IN FRINTON TODDLER FORUM SURVEYED A THOUSAND PARENTS WHO USE THEIR WEBSITE HE FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM WERE GIVING THEIR TODDLERS PORTIONS OF FOOD THEY WERE TOO BIG AND IN DOING SO THEY WERE
PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF A BEE CITY WELL JILL HARRIS WHO WAS A CHILD AND SACK CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AT BIRMINGHAM UNIVERSITY WAS BEHIND THE RESEARCH SHE'S HERE WITH US GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING HOW CAN PARENT JUDGE WHAT IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FOOD TO GIVE THEIR CHILD THIS IS WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT MY WE'VE COME UP WITH PORTION SIZE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE INFANT TOTAL FOUR AND WEBSITE AND A LOT OF PARENTS JUST DON'T KNOW
I'M ONE OF THE REAL PROBLEMS IS THAT SOME CHILDREN ARE NOT AS GOOD AT OTHERS AS SHOWING YOU WHEN THEY'RE FULL AND WHEN THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH SO THEY JUST KEEP EATING IF YOU GIVE THEM MORE FOOD AND PARENTS ARE OFTEN TOLD LOOK A CHILD KNOWS HOW MUCH AT ONCE AND WE'LL STOP THERE REGULATE THEIR OWN INTAKE YES AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S TRUTHFUL
MOST CHILDREN BUT THERE ARE A PROPORTION OF CHILDREN THAT WON'T DO THAT THEY WERE JUST KEEP EATING IF YOU PUT FOOD IN FRONT OF THEM THEY WERE KEEP EATING IF YOU GIVE THEM A LARGE PORTION SIZE THEY WERE KEEP EATING IT AND TELL US JUST AS THEY WERE I
DON'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP AND THEY SEEM TO BE HUNGRY AND I THINK THAT BUTTON PARENTS THINK THAT THEIR TARGET IS HUNGRY AND THEREFORE THEY ARE GIVING THEM MORE FOOD THAN THEY ACTUALLY NEED
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DO THIS LOOK AT YOUR CHILD IF YOUR CHILD IS SO TESSA THIN RANGY INCREDIBLY WELL THEN THEY MIGHT NEED MORE FOOD BUT IF THEY'RE NOT THEN THEY PROBABLY DON'T NEED MORE FOOD AND SO THEN WHAT DO YOU DO TO HIM
A SMALL PROPORTION A SMALL PORTION AND THEN WHEN THE CHILD IS SORT OF ANGRY OR ASKING FOR MORE SAY WHAT WELL YOU GIVE THE SMALL PORTION AND IT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SUDDENLY CUT DOWN FORCE INSIGHTS AND SAY NO NO YOU'RE HAVING HALF OF HER BEFORE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE TRAINED THEM UP TO TAKE A LARGE PORTION AND YOU CAN TRAIN CHILDREN TO OVEREAT EVEN HAVE TO HAVE GOOD INTERN REGULATION IF YOU KEEP GIVING THEM MORE THERE'LL BE MORE AND MORE HUNGRY FOR
THAT IS WHAT INCISIVE HURT BUT YOU DON'T SORT OF SUDDENLY CUT THEM DOWN THAT YOUTH CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO FILL THE TIED UP A LITTLE MORE THING MORE HIGH FIBRE MORE VEGETABLES IN THE DIET YOU JUST SORT OF CHANGE IT ROUND AND TREAT THE PORTION SIZES IS ONE OF THE STRIKING THINGS IN THIS SURVEY WAS THAT USED ESTABLISH I THINK IS THAT ONE IN TEN PARENTS ARE GIVING THEIR TODDLERS
ADULT SIZE PORTIONS YES OCCASIONALLY THEY WEALTH SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT WHAT THEY'RE GIVING TO IN THE DE THA ONE OF THOSE PORTIONS WILL BE AN ADULT SIZE PORTION YES WITHOUT REALISING IT DID HAVE MANY PARENTS WILL SAY THEY LOOK THEY'RE IS ACTUALLY THAT THEIR CHILD NOT EATING AND THEY MAY GO THROUGH A PHASE WHEN THEY'RE JUST NOT EATING THEY'RE PUSHING FOR IT AWAY SO THEY'RE VERY KEEN TO FIND SOMETHING TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE FEEDING A TRUCK I THINK THAT'S A DIFFERENCE AND ONE LEFT THE SENSES HIS CHILDREN WHO DON'T EAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHARITY DOESN'T EAT AND THEY WOULD HAVE A LIMITED RANGE
AND A CHILD WHO'S NOT EATING ENOUGH WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE RARE SO THAT PARENTS ARE THINKING THEIR CHILD EATING ENOUGH
BECAUSE SAID JUDGING IT BY WHAT THEY THINK IS A GOOD PORTION BUT THE PUSH IN THEIR JUTTING UP BUYS IS FAR TOO BIG REALLY SO YOU'VE GOT A A CHILD WHO'S EATING WELL HAVING ENOUGH AND PARENTS ARE STILL THINKING THAT THEIR CHILD IS NOT EATING ENOUGH BUT YOU MAKE IN A WAY THE OBVIOUS POINT JUST LOOK AT THE CHILD THEY'RE WELL COVERED O.K. LOOKING HEALTHY AND YET IT STILL HAPPENS IF THEY'LL BE BACK THEY'RE GIVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD
AND A LOT OF PARENTS DON'T LOOK AT THEIR CHILD DIDN'T AGREE THAT THEY'RE TIDY THROUGHOUT COVERED I THINK A LOT OF THEM SOMETHING FOR SIR THAT'S QUITE NORMAL AND CHILDREN UP
ON THE WHOLE SLIGHTLY TOO WELL COVERED THESE DAYS
SO IF ANYTHING CHIP PARENTS YOU WOULD ADVISE JUST HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT YES JUST HOLD BACK YOU GET THREE MEALS THREE PORTION SIZE YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR WEBSITE AND SEE WHAT THOSE MEAL SIZES SHOULD BE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME REALLY THAT BEEN AVAILABLE TO PARENTS JO HARRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

THE PARTY'S ONLY M.P. DOUGLAS CARDS WELL HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT THE JOB WITH THE DEPUTY LEADER PAUL NUTTAL HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS INTERESTED AND HE'S WITH US NOW IN STRASBOURG GOOD MORNING TO YOU MORNING I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD START BY JUST MAKING SURE THAT GIVEN THAT NIGEL FARAGE HAS RESIGNED TWICE BEFORE ARE YOU SURE THAT HE REALLY IS GOING THIS TIME
OH YES ABSOLUTELY NIGEL HAS BEEN A BRILLIANT LEADER OF THE PARTY HE'S TAKEN US FROM LITERALLY NOTHING TO WINNING THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO GAINING FOUR MILLION VOLTS AT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND HE SET OUT HIS POLITICAL CAREER AT TO GET US OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WHERE YOU KIP WASN'T ON THE RADAR
HE'S ACHIEVED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE AND POLITICS SO HE REALLY IS GOING OUT ON A HIGH BUT IN MANY WAYS THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WILL ASK NOW HAVE YOU CAME THAT IT'S THEY WERE HOLDING ITS RAISON DEBT TRAY PURPOSE WAS TO GET THE U.K. OUT OF THE E.U. AND THAT IS NOW GOING TO HAPPEN SO IT'S NOT AS YOU ARE CONCERNED WHAT IS THE POINT OF YOU KEPT WHAT IS ITS FUTURE
WELL FIRSTLY I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU TEN YEARS AGO YOU KIPPERS A SINGLE ISSUE PRESSURE GROUP WHICH WAS SOLELY TO GET US OUT OF EUROPEAN UNION BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE ANY MORE WE ARE A FULLY FLEDGED POLITICAL PARTY WITH A RAFT OF DOMESTIC POLICY AND OVER FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WENT OUT AND VOTED FOR US AT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND I THINK THAT THERE WAS A BANK OF PEOPLE NOW WHO WILL ALWAYS GO OUT
AND VOTE UKIP AND WE'VE GOT COUNTY COUNCIL ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR WE HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED COUNCILLORS AT THE MOMENT WE'VE GOT A LABOUR PARTY WHICH IS IN A COMPLETE MESS AND THERE IS NOW A CLEAR DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE LABOUR PARTY VOTERS AND THE LABOUR PARTY PARLIAMENTARY PARTY AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN BENEFIT FROM AND OF COURSE YOU WILL WE'VE GOT A CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADERSHIP ELECTION AT THE MOMENT WHERE BACKSTABBING SEEMS TO BE GOING ON ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE HAVE TO BE THERE TO ENSURE THAT WE HOLD THE NEXT PRIME MINISTERS FEET TO THE FIRE
BASICALLY ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T BACK SLIDE ON THE SCREEN ARE CALLED EGGHEAD SO YOU WILL BE THERE AND WE WILL BE AT THE FOREFRONT AND YOU ARE KNOWN TO BE ON THE LEFT OF THE PARTY YOU MENTION IMMEDIATELY ABOUT THE LABOUR MARTY BEING IN DISARRAY YOU WOULD INTEND IF YOU WERE LEADER TO MOVE THE PARTY TO THE LEFT WOULD YOU
NO I DON'T WEAR THIS WITH THIS ROOM IS COME THERE AND SOME HELP ON THE LEFT OF THE OXY BECAUSE I'M NOT I NEVER HAVE BEEN AT ALL WITH A WAREHOUSE WHERE ARE YOU HOW WOULD YOU DON'T DESCRIBE YOURSELF
I THINK THAT THE PARTY BASICALLY SIMPLY HAS TO BE THE PARTY OF COMMONSENSE EH WHAT THE ORDINARY MAN AND WOMAN IS SAYING ON THE STREET WHETHER THAT IS ABOUT ASPIRATION WHETHER THAT'S ABOUT THE ECONOMY WHETHER IT'S ABOUT EDUCATION OR IMMIGRATION OR CRIME AND JUSTICE I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE THE PARTY THAT SAYS WHAT IT MEANS AND MEANS WHAT IT SAYS AND THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOREFRONT TO MY OPINIONS
AND POLITICS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO WHAT CAN I PICK UP ON ONE OF THEM YOU DIDN'T MENTION IN THAT LIST THE N.H.S. WHICH WAS OF COURSE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE LEAVE CAMPAIGN TWO YEARS AGO YOU SAID THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE N.H.S. STIFLES COMPETITION IF YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN A NEW MEAN WHAT DO YOU SAY DID YOU MEAN THAT WELL ACTUALLY I SAID THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND DON'T GET INTO ART OUT ALREADY NO I DIDN'T
NO I DIDN'T I SAID THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WAS PICK YOUR MOMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT LACK OF COMPETITION WITHIN THE N.H.S. TO STIFLE AN EBB IN THIS AREA PARTICULARLY IN PROCUREMENT I THINK WE COULD DO THINGS BETTER I THINK WE COULD BRING IN PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BUY ON BEHALF OF THE N.H.S. AND WE GO FIRE THEM IF THEY DON'T GET A GOOD RESULT FOR THE BRITISH PEOPLE
OH KAY SAID WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THE N.H.S. NO IT WOULDN'T AT ALL I MEAN I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE N.H.S. SHOULD BE FREE AT THE POINT OF DELIVERY I'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ELSE
WHAT IF YOUR POTENTIAL RIVALS IS SUZANNE EVANS SHE'S NOT IN A POSITION TO STAND BECAUSE SHE SUSPENDED FROM THE PARTY SHOULD BE SHOULD SHE BE ALLOWED TO STAND
THAT ISN'T MY DECISION UNFORTUNATELY I AM THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE PARTY AND I DEAL WITH THE POLITICAL SIDE IT IS A DECISION WHICH WILL BE TAKEN BY THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE OF THE PARTY WHO DEAL WITH THE MANAGEMENT SIDE SHALL WE TELL THEM TO COME ON SUZANNE YOU WANT SOME OF YOU WANT A NICE HEALTHY COMPETITION I'VE DONE BEST POSSIBLE TALENT I SHE BE ALLOWED I DON'T AND YOU KNOW WHAT SUZANNE IS A FANTASTIC
FRONT WOMAN FOR THE PARTY SHE COMES GOSH GREAT ON TELEVISION AND REALLY GOOD ON RADIO AND I HOPE SUZANNE COMES BACK INTO THE PARTY AND WE CAN MOVE ON FORWARD AND TAKE IT FROM THERE
SHOULD SHE BE ALLOWED TO STAND IF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SAY THAT'S WHO IS ABLE TO STAND AND I WILL BACK THEM ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT O. K. BECAUSE I MEAN THE INTERESTING THING WHAT NEXT WE'RE SO AWARE OF IS THAT NIGEL FARAGE WAS OF COURSE VERY MUCH SEEN AS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE HE IS UKIP AND UKIP IS HIM AND THEN THERE IS THIS THE THEY'RE WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES BETWEEN RELATIONSHIPS NOT PLEASED WITH THE
ONE M. P. DOUGLAS CARS WHEN WE'VE ALREADY HAD NIGEL FARRAJ BASICALLY SUGGESTING THAT HE COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE PARTY HE SAID THAT LAST WEEK WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE
WELL THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MET YESTERDAY AND THE ISSUE OF DOUGLAS CAME UP AND THERE WAS NO DECISION TAKEN ON THIS TO SO YOU'RE YOUR TIPS HOW DOES YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM OH UTTERLY FINE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WITH DOUGLAS CARSWELL AT ALL AND I THINK IF YOU KEEP IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF ITSELF
THEN WE HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH THE IN FIGHTING WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER UNITY IS THE KEY AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE AND A DUTY TO THE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR US AT THAT GENERAL ELECTION TO ENSURE THAT WE HOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S FEED TO THE FIRE AND YOU KEPT GOES ON PROSPERS AND MAKES A SUCCESS OF ITSELF IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS DECADE PAUL NUTTAL THANKS VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS TWENTY THREE MINUTES PAST SEVEN ARCHAEOLOGISTS WORKING ON LINDISFARNE OFF THE NORTH EAST COAST OF ENGLAND HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE EARLIEST MONASTERY BUILT THE DIG WAS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH CROWD FUNDING IN THE TEAM IS LED BY LISA WESCOTT WILKINS CO FOUNDER OF DIGGER VENTURE SHE'S IN A LANCASTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE THAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU FOUND THIS EARLY MONASTERY HOW I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME THAT
WE FOUND LOTS OF THINGS OF INTEREST BUT THE MOST SPECTACULAR THING THAT WE FOUND IS AN ANGLO SAXON NAME STONE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAVE MARKER FOR SOMEONE BURIED NEARBY IT'S REALLY AN ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS PIECE OF SCULPTURE AND FANTASTICALLY HAS HALF OF THE NAME OF THE INDIVIDUAL STILL VISIBLE RIGHT WHAT IS THE NAME
WHAT ENDS AND FRITH WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY COMMON SORT OF ANGLO SAXON EXTENSION ON A NAME SO WE WE'VE SENT THE STONE AFTER EXPERTS NOW TO HAVE THE REST OF THE NAME RED AND WERE AWAITING THOSE RESULTS O.K. BUT THAT FROM YOU ALREADY HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW OLD IT IS AND THAT LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION ON ON THE MONASTERY YES THOSE GRAVE MARKERS ARE MID SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY FANTASTICALLY DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE OF THAT EARLIEST PERIOD ON LINDISFARNE
MUST BE TREMENDOUS FEAT FOR YOU TO HAVE THAT GIVEN WHAT YOU PUT INTO MAKING THIS DIG POSSIBLE YES I MEAN IT WAS A SPECTACULAR RAHMAN AND EVEN BETTER FOR US IS THAT IT WAS THE FIND WAS ACTUALLY MADE BY ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CROWD FUND DIG SO IT WASN'T FOUND BY ONE OF THE TEAM LEADERS ARE EXPERTS IT WAS FOUND BY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAD HELPED TO FUND AND MAKE THE PROJECT POSSIBLE
SO THE VOL AT SOMEONE WHO PLEDGED MONEY TO IT AND CAME ALONG TO TAKE PART YES ABSOLUTELY IN FACT ALL THREE OF THEIR REALLY DIAGNOSTIC FINDS THAT WE'VE HAD FROM THAT EARLY PERIOD LINDISFARNE WERE MADE BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND WE ARE NOT WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT I MEAN THESE ARE TREMENDOUSLY PRECIOUS AND ANCIENT THINGS THAT YOU FOUND YOUR HAVING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOT TRAINED ARCHAEOLOGISTS ROOTING AROUND THE EGG WAS IT NOT A BIT WORRYING FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF AN EXPERT LIKE YOURSELF
WELL THERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER WAY AND CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE WHO COME ALONG ON THE DIGS THEMSELVES ARE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED BY THE TRENCHES ARE SUPERVISE WERE WITH THEM ALL THE WAY AND IT REALLY IS ABOUT THEIR PROCESS OF DISCOVERY AND WE ARE TRYING TO DO ARCHAEOLOGY IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY WE'RE DOING IT DIGITALLY AS WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT DEAD GORGEOUS GRAVE MARKER IN THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE FOUND WE MADE THREE.D. MODELS OF WITHIN HOURS OF THEM COMING OUT OF THE TRENCHES SO THAT WE COULD SHARE THEM WITH EXPERTS IN GET SOME FEEDBACK BUT ALSO SHOW THEM WHAT THE PUBLIC WILL HELP TO FUND THAT
AND HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS FINE DO YOU THINK TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY NOT JUST ON LINDISFARNE BUT BUT ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES WERE WOOD AS THE CONTEXT WELL I MEAN IN TERMS OF THAT MACKEREL LEVEL ANNOUNCER ED HAT I HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR DAVID PETS OF DURHAM UNIVERSITY WHO WAS THE ACADEMIC LEAD ON THIS PROJECT BUT WHAT WE CAN REALLY SAY ABOUT THAT ISN'T IS NO ONCE LOOKED FOR THE EARLY MONASTERY ON LINDISFARNE BEFORE WHICH IS INCREDIBLE I MEAN THE RUINS THAT YOU'LL SEE THEY'RE NOW ARE OF A LATER BUILDING A TWELFTH CENTURY PRIORY
IT WAS THAT EARLY SETTLEMENT THAT EARLY MONASTIC COMPLEX WHERE THE LINDISFARNE GOSPELS WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AND WHERE THE VIKINGS FAMOUSLY MADE LANDFALL AND BEGAN THEIR THEIR RAIDS YOU CASE IN THIS FINE IN THE CONTEXT WHERE IT WAS WHERE IT WAS FOUND AND AMONGST RUBBLE STRUCTURES AND ABOVE SOME HUMAN BURIALS REALLY DOES SUGGEST THAT THIS THE AREA WHERE WE WERE DIGGING WAS PART OF THAT ORIGINAL COMPLEX AND NO ONE'S REALLY LITERATE BEFORE LISA WESCOTT THE KILNS GOOD LUCK WITH THE REST OF THE WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH

HAS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RELOCATE ITS OPERATIONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES THE TIMERS TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES TO EIGHT SOME SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND WILL BE DISRUPTED TODAY BY A TEACHERS' STRIKE CONTINGENCY PLANNING HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE AND WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL LATER THIS MORNING HOW GREAT THE IMPACT IS
BUT THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS OVER SCHOOL FUNDING AND TEACHERS' PAY AND WORKLOAD WILL SPEAK TO THE EDUCATION SECRETARY IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST KEVIN COURTNEY WHO'S THE ACTING GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS GOOD MORNING MORNING WHY DISRUPT CHILDREN'S LEARNING LIKE THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE SCHOOL'S BUDGET IS HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE
CLASS SIZES ARE GOING UP IN SCHOOLS WERE BEING TOLD OF SCHOOLS WERE CLASSES WILL BE THIRTY FIVE IN SEPTEMBER ARTS DANCE DRAMA TEACHERS ARE BEING MADE REDUNDANT OR NOT REPLACED WHEN THEY LEAVE INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION FOR CHILDREN IS GOING DOWN THIS IS ALL HAPPENING BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALLOWING SCHOOL BUNCH IT'S TO KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION SO GEORGE OSBORNE AND MORGAN MORGANA FREEZING THEIR CASH PER PUPIL THEY GIVE TO SCHOOLS
BUT THEY'RE NOT PUT HIM ANYTHING IN FOR INFLATION AND IN PARTICULAR THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ANYTHING IN FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES THEY'RE PUTTIN ON SCHOOL GOVERNING BODIES
THE EIGHT THAT SORRY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE EXTRA CONTRIBUTIONS NATIONAL INSURANCE AT THAT PRESS GOVERNING BODIES HAVE TO PAY EXTRA NATIONAL INSURANCE AND EXTRA PIP PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IT'S ABOUT FIVE PERCENT CHARGE ON THE TEACHER PAY BUDGET SO FOR EVERY TWENTY TEACHERS THE SCHOOL EMPLOYS THEY HAVE TO FIND A WHOLE EXTRA SALARY TO GIVE BACK TO THE TREASURY BUT IS THIS THE WAY TO GO IN IS THIS THE WAY FOR YOU TO PUT THOSE SORTS OF CONCERNS TO THE GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT ONLY TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUR MEMBERS BOTHERED TO TURN OUT TO VOTE IN THIS
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE ELECTRONIC BALLOTING ON WE THINK THAT WOULD INCREASE THE THE TURNOUT IN THESE DID YOU I'VE GOT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE MANDATE WE WE DID YES NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE WHO VOTED VOTED TO TAKE THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND SINCE WE'VE ANNOUNCED NINETY TWO PER CENT OF THE QUARTER OF YOUR MEMBERS SADE AND SINCE WE FINANCED IT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE JOINED THE UNION THIS IS A POPULAR STRIKE AMONGST OUR MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE ISSUES REALLY MATTER TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE THERE TEACHING THEY ALSO THEN HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR PAY AND CONDITIONS
WE WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THESE THINGS THROUGH TALKS WE DON'T WANT TO DISRUPT CHILDREN'S EDUCATION OR PARENTS WORKING LIVES BUT IN THE TALKS AT THAT WE ARE HAVING MICKEY MORGAN DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY SHE WROTE ME A LETTER JUST ON SATURDAY SAYING THAT THE SCHOOL BUDGET IT'S GOING TO BE PROTECTED IN REAL TERMS
WHICH ISN'T TRUE THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYS EIGHT PER CENT CUT THAT'S WHY CLASS SIZES ARE GOING LIKE IT'S BEEN CUT THANK YOU NICKY MORGAN IS LISTENING AND SHE'S IN OUR WESTMINSTER STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT THAT THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU WERE PUTTING FORWARD JUST HAS NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE REAL TERMS CUT THAT SCHOOLS ARE HAVING TO IMPLEMENT WHAT I FEEL I JUST DON'T RECOGNISE THAT THAT PICTURE
THE SCHOOL'S BUDGET IS THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN THIS YEAR AT FORTY BILLION POUNDS IT'S GONE UP BY FOUR BILLION SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN TWELVE AND AS YOU SAID THE STRIKE BALLOT HAD A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT TURNOUT SO ACTUALLY WAS REPRESENTS LESS THAN TEN PER CENT OF THE ENTIRE TEACHING PROFESSION SO CHEMICAL TALKS ABOUT TALKS
WE HAVE STARTED TALKS AGAIN WE'VE HAD A POKE OUR TALKS WITH THE UNIONS THAT CONTINUES ON THE ISSUES THAT HE SAYS HE BALLOTING AND THAT HE CARES ABOUT RIGHT HE TALKS LIKE THIS IS WHERE YOU HANG ON JUST JUST JUST JUST A MO BECAUSE THAT THE POINT ABOUT THE SCHOOLS' BUDGET GOING GOING UP THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IF IT'S NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THE NUMBERS OF PUPILS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE UNION WHICH IS SAYING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A REAL TERMS FALL THE INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES SAYS SPENDING PER PUPIL IN ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO FALL BY AROUND EIGHT PERCENT IN REAL TERMS BY TWENTY TWENTY
BUT THE BUDGET IS GOING UP AND WE HAVE PROTECTED THE SCHOOLS' BUDGET IN WEE I'M SENDING PER PUPIL NOT THE OVERALL BUDGET WELL BUT WE HAVE PROTECTED SPENDING PER PUPIL BUT THE POINT IS WE HAVE ACROSS THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAD TO TAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS WE KNOW WE HAVE IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WE KNOW THAT PUBLIC SECTOR PAY IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT HAS BEEN BEEN OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED
BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE THE ALTERNATIVE AS WE END UP IN A SITUATION LIKE SPAIN OR GREECE WITHOUT A SLASH EDUCATION BUDGETS BY UP TO THIRTY PERCENT OF THOUSANDS ARE TEACHERS WERE MADE REDUNDANT YOU KEVIN COURTNEY SAYS THIS STRIKE IS POPULAR WITH WITTY SO I CAN TELL IT'S NOT POPULAR WITH SCHOOL LEADERS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT POPULAR WITH PARENTS FOR HIM THIS IS A HUGE INCONVENIENCE BUT IT WAS NOT POPULAR WITH PUPILS WHO ARE MISSING OUT ON A DAY'S EDUCATION AND IF KEVIN COURTNEY
WANTS TO SORT THIS OUT ON POPPY'S MEMBERS WANT TO HAVE HIS SAY THAN THE POLICE DO THAT IS THE TALKS THAT ARE ALREADY HAPPENING WITH ME AND OTHER MINISTERS NOT BY TAKING STRIKE ACTION WHICH PUTS CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AT RISK ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CONTEST BECAUSE YOU'LL BE TAKING PART IN THAT FIRST ROUND OF VOTING TODAY YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN THE TELEGRAPH THIS MORNING ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT FOR MICHAEL GO FOR CALLING HIM A WARRIOR FOR THE DISPOSSESSED IS HE A TRUSTWORTHY WARRIOR
# WELL I HAVE WORKED WITH MICHAEL SINCE OBVIOUSLY TAKING OVER THIS JOB TWO YEARS AGO AND I HAVE FOUND HIM TO BE EXCEPTION TRUSTWORTHY BUT I'VE ALSO FOUND HIM TO BE A MAN OF ENORMOUS PRINCIPLES AND CONVICTION THAT MEANS HE HAS TO UPSET PEOPLE HE WILL DO THAT BECAUSE HE HAS THE IDEAS AND THE VISION
TO TACKLE THE ISSUES WHICH I THINK THE SEISMIC VOTE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE CAPTURED THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FEEL VERY LEFT BEHIND THEY'RE FED UP WITH LISTENING TO POLITICIANS TELLING THEM HOW THEY WANT THINGS TO BE AND THAT'S NOT THE REALITY IF I WAS YOU WERE CONSIDERING RUNNING FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU PROBABLY HAD A CAMPAIGN MANAGER IN MIND IF THAT CAMPAIGN MANAGER HAD DECIDED AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR TO RUN
INSTEAD ALTERED TO RUN AS WELL TO DECIDE TO RUN FOR THE LEADERSHIP THEMSELVES WOULD YOU CONSIDER THEM TRUSTWORTHY I WOULD CONSIDER THAT TO BE POLITICS WHERE PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE OUTCOMES AND THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE REASON I DECIDED NOT TO STAND AND YOU'RE RIGHT I DID THINK VERY HARD ABOUT IT WAS BECAUSE THE FEEDBACK I GOT FROM COLLEAGUES FROM PARTY MEMBERS FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE EMAILING ME
WAS THAT BECAUSE WE HAD THIS LEAD VOTE ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO VOTED LEAVE WHO SHOULD BE THERE AT THE HELM NEGOTIATING OUR EXIT FROM THE E.U. AND I THINK THAT'S STILL VERY MUCH HOLDS I THINK AFTER ALL THAT THE LEAVE CANDIDATES IF YOU LIKE AND OR LEADERSHIP MICHAEL GO WAS CLEARLY THE MAN WITH CABINET LEVEL EXPERIENCE IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE OTHERS SO THAT MEANS IF HE ENDS UP NOT MAKING IT THROUGH NOT ENDING UP AS AS AS THE LEADER WOULD YOU SERVE UNDER THERESA MAY
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY I'VE BEEN A PARTY MEMBER FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY THAT IS A MATTER VERY MUCH FOR ANYBODY WHO IS EVENTUALLY PRIME MINISTER AS TO WHO THEY WANT TO HAVE IN THEIR BE HAPPY TO SERVE UNDER OF SOMEONE WHO WAS A LEAVE OR A RETAINER I THINK IT DEPENDS ON IT'S FOR THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP TO DECIDE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT BEFORE THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP IN THE COUNTRY
TO REALLY EXPERIENCE POLITICIANS WE HAVE IN A LEADERSHIP CONTEST PEOPLE WITH TOP FLIGHT CABIN THEY'LL EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THEIR PETS TECHNICAL DECISIONS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS MICHAEL GAVE I THINK THE REASONS I SET OUT HE'S THE RIGHT PERSON TO TAKE THIS ON MICKEY MORGAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS TO YOU KEVIN COURTNEY
# IT'S TWENTY MINUTES TO EIGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PAPERS AND THE FRONT PAGES FEATURE EITHER A GRINNING NIGEL FAHRT ARGE OR A SOMBRE CHRIS EVANS AFTER THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR RESIGNATIONS AS UKIP LEADER AND TOP GEAR PRESENTER RESPECTIVELY THE TIMES CARTOON UNITES THE STORIES IT HAS MY BARRAGE WALKING AWAY FROM HER WRECKED CAR WITH THE UNION JACK PAINTED ON ITS ROOF DECLARING AND ON THAT BOMBSHELL I'M OFF
THE TELEGRAPH CALLED HIM CONTROVERSIAL AND DIVISIVE BUT SAYS HE WILL GO IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE MEN WHO HELPED TAKE BRITAIN OUT OF THE E.U. THE SON SAYS HE WAS AT TIMES OFFENSIVE BUT HIS LEADERSHIP ENDED IN SPECTACULAR SUCCESS THE MIRROR ACCUSES HIM OF SELFISHLY BAILING OUT AND SAYS HE SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE SHE'S HELPED INFLICT ON THE COUNTRY
RECALLING THE TWO PREVIOUS NIGEL FAHRT AAGE RESIGNATIONS MARINA HYDE WRITES IN THE GUARDIAN THAT IT FEELS PRUDENT TO REGARD THIS ONE AS A SABBATICAL IN THE RACE FOR THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP THE DAILY MAIL PRAISES THERESA MAY'S A VICAR'S DAUGHTER FROM THE HEART OF MIDDLE ENGLAND WITH A REPUTATION FOR HARD WORK FOR THE SAKE OF THE PARTY AND BRITAIN IT COMMENTS IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE
# BORIS JOHNSON'S ENDORSEMENT OF ANDREA LEADS IN THE SCENE BY THE GUARDIAN AS A COUP FOR HER CAMPAIGN THE TIMES THEY REPORTS THAT MISSUS LETS IS FACING QUESTIONS OVER HER TAX AFFAIRS BECAUSE A COMPANY RUN BY HER HUSBAND AND OWNED BY HER BROTHER IN LAW USED TO TRUST TO PAY EMPLOYEES UNTIL TWENTY ELEVEN THEY NOT ILLEGAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST CAN BE USED TO AVOID TAX AND HAD BEEN DESCRIBED AS MORALLY REPUGNANT BY THE CHANCELLOR MISSUS LED SOME WHO HAS RECEIVED DONATIONS FROM THE COMPANY GLOUCESTER RESEARCH SAYS SHE WASN'T AWARE IT HAD USED SUCH TRUST
# THE DAILY MIRROR HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO WHAT IT CALLS CONCERNED SOURCES WITHIN THE LABOUR PARTY ABOUT JEREMY CORBIN ONE WHO WORKED INSIDE THE LEADER'S OFFICE CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE HOURS OF RAMBLING MEETINGS TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE PLOTS AGAINST HIM ANOTHER FROM LABOUR HEADQUARTERS COMPLAINS THAT MISTER CORBIN SAT SILENTLY IN WEEKLY PLANNING MEETINGS MUNCHING NOODLES WHILE OTHERS TOOK CHARGE THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY MY TEAM AS FICTIONAL ACCOUNTS AIMED AT DESTABILISING THE LEADERSHIP
# IN THE TIMES RACHEL SYLVESTER SAYS A GROWING NUMBER OF M.P.S PEERS CANDIDATES AND ADVISORS BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO START A NEW PARTY OF THE CENTRE LEFT SHE QUOTES ONE ANONYMOUSLY WHO SAYS THERE'S A MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR A PRO BUSINESS SOCIALLY LEVEL LIBERAL PARTY IN FAVOUR OF THE E.U. THE TIME IS NOW EIGHTEEN MINUTES TO IT
# TWENTY YEARS AGO TODAY A SHEEP WAS BORN WHO CHANGED HISTORY DOLLY THE SHEEP WAS THE FIRST MAMMAL TO BE CLONED FROM AN ADULT CELL IT WAS A REMARKABLE SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT AND IT ALSO GAVE A HUGE BOOST TO MUCH OF THE STEM CELL RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT SINCE PROFESSOR IAN WILMER LED THE RESEARCH THAT CREATED DOLLY AT THE ROSLIN INSTITUTE IN EDINBURGH HERE'S WHAT HE SAID AT THE TIME
I DON'T THINK WE CAN BEGIN TO ESTIMATE I DON'T WHAT YOU WERE UNDERSTANDING THIS WILL OFFER NOT ONLY FROM NORMAL HEALTH BUT ALSO FOR FOR HUMAN DISEASES AND I THINK THAT SUCCESS HAS UNDOUBTEDLY WILL SEE THAT THAT USE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT
THAT CLIP FROM PARFAITS ARCHIVE WELL PROFESSOR IN MOMENT DOLLY'S CRATER IS WITH US IN EDINBURGH AGAIN NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I THINK YOU DESCRIBED THE CREATION OF DOLLY AS A STROKE OF LUCK BUT IT WAS A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT WASN'T IT I THINK WE'LL STATEMENTS ARE TRUE YES
WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING THEN WHAT WERE YOUR EXPECTATIONS COMPARED WITH WHAT HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED I THINK FAR MORE USE HAS BEEN POSSIBLE WITH STEM CELLS AND SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND DISEASES EVEN MORE DRAMATICALLY THAN IFE PREDICTED AT THE TIME
BECAUSE IT CAN YOU SPOKE AS THE SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT DOLLY WAS THAT YOU TOOK A NORMAL SKIN CELL OF A SHEEP AND MANAGED TO TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BECAME AN EMBRYO
I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT WE DID TAKE A CELL FROM AN ADULT ANIMAL LUNCH OBTAINED AN EMBRYO WITH IT UM WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS THAT THAT CELL HAD ALL OF THE GENETIC INFORMATION IS THAT'S NECESSARY TO CONTROL DEVELOPMENT
THAT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BILLY THAT D.N.A. COULD BE CHANGED SO THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A MAMMARY SO WHO BECAME AN EMBRYO
UNTIL THEN PEOPLE HAD BELIEVED THAT ONCE A CELL HAD BECOME A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CELL IT WAS FIXED AND COULDN'T BE CHANGED FROM THAT CLEARLY WAS NOT THE CASE SO THIS STIMULATED RESEARCH IN MANY DIFFERENT LABORATORIES TO TRY TO FIND OTHER WAYS OF CHANGING SO OF US HAVE THE EGG COULD BRING ABOUT THESE CHANGES COULD WE FIND OTHER WAYS OF TAKING US AN ADULT CELL AND CHANGING IT INTO SOMETHING LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE STEM CELL AND THE ANSWER WAS YES THEY CAUGHT SO TWO DIFFERENT LABS DID THAT WE NOW HAVE THESE PROCEDURES AS ROUTINES
SO THE FOR EXAMPLE WE NOW NO LONGER NEED EMBRYOS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CELLS WHICH HAVE THESE ABILITIES OF BEING ABLE TO FORM DIFFERENT TISSUE AND TOOK TO MULTIPLY MANY TIMES IT YOU DID SAY THOUGH AS YOU AS YOUR KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS A STROKE OF LUCK WHY DO YOU SAY THAT I MEAN IT COULD IT NOT HAVE HAPPENED PERHAPS IT COULD HAVE BEEN WHAT DECADES LATER THAT IT HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAD HAPPENED I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE SAME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING WOULD HAVE COME ABOUT ANOTHER WAY BUT QUOTE COULD WELL HAVE BEEN DELAYED UNTIL NOW OR EVEN FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE WE WERE LUCKY THE WAY THAT RESEARCH DEVELOPED
AND HAVE TAKEN FULL ADVANTAGE OF IT OF COURSE MEANT EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER AT THE TIME THE IMMEDIATE FEAR IT WAS SHOCKING IN A WAY BUT THERE THAT THAT L.A. CLONED A SHEEP HAD BEEN CREATED BUT THE FEAR WAS OF CLONED HUMANS IMMEDIATELY
WHAT WAS DISCOVERED VERY QUICKLY WAS THAT PEGS IN FROM PRIMATES INCLUDING HUMANS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER SPECIES SO THAT IF YOU APPLY THE ROSLIN PROTOCOL TO PRIMATE EGGS THE CLONING PROCEDURE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK
SOME UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN GOING SINCE THEN HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER WE HAVE YET OR ANYBODY HAS YOU'VE GOT A PROCEDURE WHICH WILL OPEN CLONE A HUMAN BEING
WITH WITH DOLLY SHE AGED PREMATURELY DIDN'T SHE I MEAN IT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS RAISED ABOUT IF YOU TAKE A CELL THAT EFFECTIVELY IS ALREADY OLD AND YOU GROW IT FROM AN EMBRYO IT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES
THIS EXPRESSION OF PREMATURE AGEING WAS REFERRING ONLY TO THE STRUCTURES AT THE END OF HER CHROMOSOMES WERE WHICH ACT TO HOLD THE CHROMOSOMES TOGETHER AND THEY WERE INDEED SHORTER
THIS DOESN'T NORMALLY HAPPEN AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF DOLLY SO IT IS NOT A THINKER A GENERAL CONCERN OF CLONING PROCEDURES OR YOU THINK IT WAS PECULIAR TO DOLLY YES
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED AND IN FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT MORE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THE NEW EXPECTED WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES AS A RESULT OF IT
I THINK THAT THE RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'LL CONTINUE HER PACE AND WE WILL BECOME BETTER AT PRODUCING CELLS FROM AN ADULT INDIVIDUAL CELLS THAT CAN BE USED IN RESEARCH OR IN THERAPY
SO THAT THE NUMBER OF DISEASES WHICH WILL BE STUDDED WILL IT INCREASE AND THE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS THAT IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE OF A DISEASE AND THEN WE CAN HAVE IT ACCURATE WAYS OF LOOKING FOR DRUGS WHICH PRINT PREVENTS THESE ABNORMAL EVENTS AND WILL PREVENT THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE
AND AS A AS A SOCIETY WE'RE MUCH MORE USED TO PRODUCING AND TAKING MEDICINES THAN WE ARE USED TO PRODUCING CELLS FOR TREATMENT AND THERAPY
# PROFESSOR SAYIN WILMOTT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THE TIME IS TWELVE MINUTES TO EIGHT TIME FOR THOUGHT FOR THE DAY AND THE SPEAKER AND A STUDIO THIS MORNING IS REVEREND DOCTOR SAM WORLDS VICAR OF SAINT MARTIN IN THE FIELDS GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING
WHEN I WAS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR EVERY STUDENT IN THE CLASS WERE DOING A VALUATION AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER READING THE EVALUATIONS WAS BEST DONE AFTER A STIFF WHISKY ONE STUDENT DEMANDED WHAT HE CALCULATED AS THE COST OF THE COURSE NOT FROM THE UNIVERSITY BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY BECAUSE HE FELT MY TEACHING WAS SO DERISORY FEW OF US IN REGULAR LIFE EVER ASK FOR THAT KIND OF RIGOUROUS FEEDBACK SO WE REMAIN IN BLISSFUL IGNORANCE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE REALLY THINK OF US
LIKE OTHERS I FIND THE LAST TEN DAYS OR REVEALING EXPERIENCE AND DISCOVERING WHAT PEOPLE TRULY THINK ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS I'VE TALKED WITH NEIGHBOURS I THOUGHT I KNEW WELL AND IT'S TURNED OUT SOME HAVE PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT CONVICTIONS FROM ME ON REALLY SIGNIFICANT THINGS
THIS COMING WEEKEND THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND GENERAL SYNOD IS HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND HUMAN SEXUALITY CONVERSATIONS WHERE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEIR PROFOUND DISAGREEMENT ABOUT ONE THING JEOPARDISES THEIR ABILITY TO BE CIVIL TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE IT TAKES PATIENCE AND HUMILITY TO LISTEN AND LEARN RATHER THEM SHUN AND CALL EACH OTHER NAMES
SOME YEARS AGO I HAD A TERRIBLE FALLING OUT WITH THE PERSON I THOUGHT OF AS A CLOSE FRIEND THERE WERE RAISED VOICES TEARS DISMAY FURY AND GRIEF BUT WE FOUND WE COULDN'T GO THROUGH LIFE IGNORING ONE ANOTHER WE COULDN'T HAND ON HEART MAINTAIN AND DEFINITELY THAT ALL THE WRONG WAS ON ONE SIDE AND WE COULDN'T DESPITE THE PAIN DENIED THAT OUR LIVES WERE IMPOVERISHED WITHOUT ONE ANOTHER
FOR A WHILE NEITHER OF US COULD SAY ANYTHING I GUESS THAT WAS A WAY OF RECOGNISING THAT THIS WASN'T TRIVIAL AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE HEAD OR HEART OR GUT IT WAS ABOUT ALL THREE
BUT GRADUALLY WE BEGAN TO BE IN CONTACT AGAIN MUTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGING WE WERE DIMINISHED WITHOUT EACH OTHER AND WITHOUT EXACTLY SAYING SORRY
BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS AGAIN WE SET SOME RULES WE WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER AND WE HAD ALWAYS ASSUME THE BEST INTERPRETATION OF EACH OTHER'S ACTIONS RATHER THAN CONCOCT A CONSPIRACY THEORY IN WHICH WE WITH THE VICTIM
THE AMAZING THING IS THAT THIS HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS FRIENDSHIPS OF MY LIFE IT'S NO LONGER BASED ON WISHFUL THINKING OR A NAIVE ASSUMPTION THAT WE AGREE ABOUT THINGS WITHOUT NEEDING TO CHECK FIRST AND IT'S ALSO DEEPEN MY SENSE OF GOD BECAUSE I REALISED TO RELATE TO GOD I CAN'T RELY ON WISH PROJECTION BUT MUST TEST MY PERCEPTIONS EVERY DAY
WE'RE TOLD YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE TRUTH IS EASY TO HEAR OR THAT THE TRUTH IS EVER ALL ON OUR SIDE
# THAT WAS THOUGHT FOR THE DAY WITH REVERENT DOCTOR SAM WELLS THE TIME IS TEN TO EIGHT SO JOHN'S CHILCOTT WILL DELIVER HIS LONG AWAITED VERDICT ON BRITAIN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE IRAQ WAR TOMORROW BUT HOW DO YOU SUM UP ITS EFFECT ON IRAQIS THEMSELVES ONE MAN WHO FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CENTRE OF PERHAPS THE MOST EUPHORIC MOMENT OF THE WAR THE TOPPLING OF THE FAMOUS STATUE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN IN CENTRAL BAGHDAD
HIS CADDY SHOWER OF SHARIF HAS SAINT ALGER BOURREE HE'S BEEN SPEAKING TO A MIDDLE EAST EDITOR JEREMY BELL
BAGHDAD IS SLUMPED UNDER ITS USUAL SUMMER BLANKET OF FIFTY DEGREE HEAT
ON THIS TRAFFIC ROUNDABOUT IN FOR DO SQUARE IN THE CITY CENTRE I CAN SEE A BATTERED PLINTH ABOUT TWENTY FEET HIGH AND A METAL FOOT THIS WAS THE SITE THIRTEEN YEARS AGO ON THE NINTH OF APRIL TWO THOUSAND AND THREE OF ONE OF THE MOST SYMBOLIC MOMENTS IN THE INVASION OF
IRAQIS HELP BY AMERICAN SOLDIERS TOPPLED A BIG BRONZE STATUE OF IRAQ TO DICTATOR SADDAM HUSSEIN LIVE ON INTERNATIONAL T.V.
HOURS BEFORE THE AMERICAN SPEARHEAD REACH CENTRAL BAGHDAD HAD EMAIL JOB WORRY CHAMPION WEIGHTLIFTER HAD ALREADY DECIDED THAT HE WOULD BRING THE STATUE DOWN A LOT ARE YOU GONNA SURVIVE THEM WE CAN'T
NOT A LOT OF WHAT I THINK ON THE DAY I HEARD THE AMERICANS HAD ARRIVED AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD I WAS VERY HAPPY AND I GOT THE SLEDGEHAMMER AND I WENT TO THE SQUARE
THEN THE AMERICAN TANK CAME TO HELP
THE STATUE HAD BEEN COME DOWN IT LOOKED AS IF THE WINCH WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH BUT THEN WHEN THEY PULLED IT AGAIN THE STATUE FELL
WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO GET HER DOWN ONE OF THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS PUT A U.S. FLAG ON THE STATUE'S FACE I WASN'T HAPPY SO I SAID PUT THE IRAQI FLAG UP THERE INSTEAD BUT SHE COULD I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT DAY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS CAME AND GOT RID OF SADDAM'S REGIME
BUT IT DIDN'T LAST BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO AN OCCUPATION NOBODY WANTS HIS COUNTRY TO BE OCCUPIED
I VISITED BAGHDAD MANY TIMES IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IRAQ WAS IN THE GRIP OF A BRUTAL POLICE STATE BUT THE STREETS WERE SAFE
NOW IF PEOPLE CAN AFFORD IT THEY LIVE BEHIND HEAVY SECURITY
I CAN SEE BLAST WALLS BARBED WIRE HEAVY STEEL DOORS THE INVASION NEVER HAD
THE AMERICANS DISSOLVE THE IRAQI ARMY AND SECURITY SERVICES AND SACKED OFFICIALS WHO'D JOIN SADDAM'S RULING PARTY
THE IRAQI STATE COLLAPSED LOOTERS ROAMED THE STREETS
LIKE MANY IRAQIS HAD DIMAGGIO BOURREE IS NOSTALGIC FOR THE OLD CERTAINTIES
EVEN THOUGH SADDAM'S REGIME KILLED FOURTEEN MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY AND IMPRISONED HIM FOR TWO YEARS
BUT AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS OF FEAR AND KILLING HE WISHES HE'D LEFT HIS SLEDGEHAMMER AT HOME ON THAT DAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE SO TALK FOLLOWERS
I'D LIKE TO REBUILD THEIR STATUE TO PUT IT UP AGAIN BECAUSE SADDAM HAS GONE AND WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND SADDAM'S NOW ONE THOUSAND YOU TALKING ABOUT THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY THE POLITICIANS THE MALON BELOW THEY DESTROYED THE COUNTRY THEY ARE THIEVES AND KILLERS LOOK OF THE KILLINGS IT'S VERY CLEAR SADDAM NEVER EXECUTED PEOPLE WITHOUT REASON HE WAS LIKE A WALL
THERE WAS NO CORRUPTION OR LOOTING IT WAS SAFE AT THAT SADDAM SADDAM KILLED PEOPLE I'M HERE WHERE MASS GRAVES BUT WE NEVER SHOW ANYTHING LIKE THIS GOVERNMENT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED THE CLOCK BACK ONE HUNDRED YEARS
BEFORE THE INVASION MOST IRAQIS DID NOT DEFINED THEMSELVES POLITICALLY BY THEIR RELIGIOUS GROUPS
BUT THEY RETREATED INTO THEIR SETS AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IMPOSED BY THE AMERICANS RAN ON SECTARIAN LINES
SUNNI EXTREMISTS FROM OUR CHI HAD MOVED INTO THE YAWNING SECURITY VACUUM IRAN SPONSORED SHIA MILITIAS
BY TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THERE WAS A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN SHIA AND SUNNI MUSLIMS THEY KILLED THOUSANDS
IN MANY WAYS IT CONTINUES
HAD EMAILED YOU BOURREE LIKE MANY IRAQIS BLAMES FOREIGNERS FOR STARTING A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT DESTROYED THE COUNTRY
AND HE BLAMES NEW IRAQI LEADERS FOR FAILING A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HAVEN'T THINGS WON'T BE BETTER UNTIL THESE POLITICAL PARTIES GIRL AND THEN ONE PERSON RULES LIKE A PRESIDENT OR PRIME MINISTER
THEN MAYBE WE'D BE BETTER BUT ACTUALLY THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE PRESIDENT BUSH AND MISTER BLAIR SAID THEY BROUGHT DEMOCRACY TO IRAQ
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT RUSH INTO THAT
THEY ARE LIARS DEFINITELY THEY ARE LIARS BECAUSE THEY DESTROY THE IRAQ BLAIR AND BUSH THEY'VE GOT US BACK TO ZERO AND WE WENT BACK TO THE MIDDLE AGES OR MAYBE BEFORE THAT IF TONY BLAIR WAS HERE THIS MORNING
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM I WILL LEARN TOO MUCH WELL I WOULD SAY TO HIM YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND I'D SPIT IN HIS FACE
THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE INVASION WAS A CATASTROPHE FOR IRAQ HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN VIOLENCE BUT HAS NEVER ENDED
THE JIHADISTS WHO MOVED INTO IRAQ AFTER THE INVASION NOW CALL THEMSELVES ISLAMIC STATE
SECTARIAN CONFLICT HAS REVIVED AND HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION NATIONAL UNITY AS A MEMORY THE KURDS HAVE BUILT WHAT AMOUNTS TO AN INDEPENDENT STATE IN NORTHERN IRAQ
WHEN THE AMERICANS AND BRITISH AND OTHERS INVADED THEY DIDN'T FORESEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS OR MAKE A PROPER PLAN FOR THE FUTURE
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THE INVASION ARE STILL SHAKING THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE WIDER WORLD JEREMY BURN REPORTING
# THE TIME IS THREE MINUTES TO EIGHT AND THEN RICH IS HERE WITH THE WEATHER BETTER YES THANK YOU MICHELLE GOOD MORNING TO YOU WELL IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A CLOUDY START FOR MANY OF US BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE DAY SHAPING UP QUITE PROMISINGLY IF YOU LIKE DRY WEATHER AND SUNSHINE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF DRY WEATHER AROUND SOME SUNNY SPELLS DEVELOPING THE DRIEST WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTH THE FURTHER NORTH AND EAST YOU ARE THERE IS A CHANCE OF SEEING SOME PRETTY HEAVY THUNDERY DOWNPOURS AT TIMES BUT I'LL BEGIN THE FORECAST ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS ACROSS SOUTH WEST ENGLAND SOUTH EAST ENGLAND

SO MY STARTING POINT GOING INTO THESE NEGOTIATIONS IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE COME HERE TO WORK TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY SHOULDN'T BE BROUGHT IN AS NEGOTIATION PIECES IN THIS NOW YOU'RE PRESENTING A SCENARIO WHERE THE OTHER SIDE
BRINGIN YOU CAME CITIZENS WHO ARE RESIDENT IN THE E.U. AS NEGOTIATION CHIPS ON THERE SON I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IN THE CIVILISED WORLD THAT WE STILL LIVE IN THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE A SCENARIO NOT IF WE DON'T LIVE IN THE CIVILISED WORLD AND YOU HAVE TO FACE THAT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN B. WELL
THERE'S A DANGER HERE THAT WE THAT WE SLIP INTO A MINDSET OF REGARDING THE PEOPLE WHO LEAD COUNTRIES ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN EUROPE AS OUR ENEMIES THEY ARE NOT WE ARE GOING TO GO INTO A PERIOD OF VERY TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE IDEA THAT WE WILL BE LIKE SOME KIND OF CHECKPOINT CHARLIE SCENARIO WE WERE ARGUING OVER TRADING PEOPLE LIVING IN EACH OTHER'S COUNTRIES THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN I THINK
IT'S THE NEW PRIME MINISTER NEEDS TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S A MARK OF A DECENT SOCIETY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE E.U. CITIZENS WHO ARE RESIDENT IN THE U.K. BRING THEM IN HIS NEGOTIATING CHIPS INTO WHAT WILL BE A VERY VERY TOUGH NEGOTIATION HORROR AND IS IT A NEGOTIATION THAT YOU WERE TRIGGER IMMEDIATELY AFTER BECOMING PRIME MINISTER OF THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU DO YOU TRIGGER ARTICLE FIFTY AT THAT POINT NO I'M I AND I DID AND I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE FOR PEOPLE TO RUSH OUT WITH US TRYING TO SET OUT
A TIMETABLE RIGHT NOW FOR ACTIVATING ARTICLE FIFTY LET'S BE CLEAR THE THE DUST HASN'T EVEN REALLY BEGUN TO SETTLE ON THE KIND OF POLITICAL CHOICES THAT LEAD TO GET MADE NOW FOLLOWING THE OUTCOME OF THE REFERENDUM AND I THINK PEOPLE AND THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE NEW PRIME MINISTER IS TO TAKE STOCK AND REALLY
WORK UP A CLEAR VISION FOR WHAT IS IN THE U.K. NATIONAL INTEREST GOING INTO THESE NEGOTIATION LET'S GO BY THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER THE DUST WOULD HAVE SETTLED AND THAT NEW PRIMERS WILL FIND THEMSELVES UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM THE REST OF THE Y. YOU TWO GET STARTED ARE YOU SAYING YOU WOULD NEED A FEW MONTHS OR ARE YOU SAYING YOU'D TAKE A YEAR
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT A PERIOD OF MONTHS HERE BUT SOME OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THIS LEADERSHIP RACE HAVE FELT UNDER PRESSURE TO START SETTING OUT NOW WHAT THEY TIMETABLE WOULD BE I THINK THERE'S A STEP THAT WE ALL NEED TO TAKE BEFORE THAT WHICH IS ACTUALLY TO BE CLEAR ABOUT
WHAT IS THE U.K. NATIONAL INTEREST HERE GOING INTO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'VE SAID IT'LL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A WHOLE UNITED KINGDOM PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THINK ACTUALLY THE NATIONS OF SCOTLAND WALES NORTHERN IRELAND I THINK THE MAYOR OF LONDON'S GOT A ROLE IN THOSE KIND OF DISCUSSIONS WE NEED TO BE CLEAR WHAT IT IS THAT WE WANT OUT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NEGOTIATING FOR THE BEST TERMS FOR THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID YOU WOULD DO ECONOMICALLY IS THAT YOU WOULD
SET OFF A ONE HUNDRED BILLION POUND GROWING BRITAIN FUND THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY ISSUING TWENTY BILLION POUNDS OF LONG DATED BOMBS EACH YEAR FOR FIVE SUCCESSIVE YEARS ARE YOU A HAPPY WITH BORROWING TO INVEST YES I THINK WE'RE A MAJOR TURNING POINT OBVIOUSLY POLITICALLY WHICH WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TURN THIS TO OUR ADVANTAGE UNTIL ALL OF THE CHALLENGES OF BRICKS INTO THIS OPPORTUNITY AND WITH A SENSE OF OPTIMISM I THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO CAPTURE THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SOME
A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CHOICES AND MOMENT WHEN BORROWING IS RECORD LOWS THE PRICE OF BORROWING I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT POLICY LEVERS DEVELOPED ECONOMY HAS TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND IT'S RODS IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CHOICE MISTER CRABBE IT'S PRETTY MUCH A U. TURN OF THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT YOU'VE BEEN A PART OF WHICH IS TALKED ABOUT I MEAN YOU ANTS ARE JOB WHO WOULD BE YOUR CHANCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THE DEFICIT BEING THE BIGGEST RISK TO THE ECONOMY AND NOW YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD SOMETHING THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY LABOUR'S PLAN BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO ED BALLS FOR BORROWING TO INVEST WHICH IS HIS PLAN IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FOR BOTH FROM THE KIND OF POLICY ESPOUSED BY LABOUR AND ALSO THE PRACTICE OF LABOUR BORROWING
WHEN THEY WERE IN GOVERNMENT THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER THEY BORROWED ENORMOUS SUMS OF MONEY NOT FOR INVESTING IN A BILL AT THE LAST ELECTION MOST BORROWING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED UNDER THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT UNDER GORDON BROWN THEY'D THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PLANNED THAT THEY PUT FORWARD TO THE ELECTORATE LAST YEAR WHICH INVOLVED PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD NOW AS A SAYING THEY DIDN'T
BORROW TO INVEST AND PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY MISSED THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT WE ARE A TURNING POINT IN OUR ECONOMY IF WE ARE GOING TO TURN THIS ENORMOUS CHALLENGE OF BRECHT'S IT TO OUR ADVANTAGE THEN I THINK ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT BORROW AT THE COST OF BORROWING THAT HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS
ACTUALLY TAKING BOLD DECISIONS TO IMPROVE OUR NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REALLY KEY WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTIVITY LONGTERM AND WE'VE GOT THE HISTORIC PROBLEM WITH LOW LEVELS OF BRITISH PRODUCTIVITY THOSE ARE THE KIND OF BOLD CHOICES THAT I THINK A NEW PRIME MINISTER THEY MAKE THE CHOICES THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS LABOUR'S PLAN AS BEING ONE THAT WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC CHAOS DOES THIS MEAN YOU NO LONGER THINK THAT CUTTING THE DEFICIT IS THAT IMPORTANT
IT WILL ALMOST BE A HALLMARK OF A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO NOT UNDER HERE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU PUT A PUT A REALLY REALLY STRONG EMPHASIS ON FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND CONTROLLING SPENDING BUT BEING CLEAR ABOUT THE FAT WHEN YOU'RE INVESTING IN PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS POINT HAS BEEN MADE REPEATEDLY BY ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE I.M.F. WHEN YOU'RE INVESTING IN PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE
HIGH QUALITY RAILWAYS ROADS UNIVERSITIES INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THAT YOU GROW THE ECONOMY YOU ARE YOU ARE INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BRITAIN COMING OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW THAT MEANS THAT BRITAIN HAS TO FORGE A NEW FUTURE IN THE WORLD I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY THEN YES WE DO NEED TO MAKE SOME DIFFERENT AND QUITE BOLD AND RADICAL ECONOMIC CHOICES LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN PERSONAL VIEWS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENT PARTICULAR ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE TO HOMOSEXUALITY
# YOU VOTED AGAINST SAME SEX MARRIAGE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN HAVE YOUR VIEWS CHANGED OR IF THAT VOTE WAS TO HAPPEN TODAY WOULD YOU VOTE DIFFERENTLY SO I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE I DID YOU'RE RIGHT I DID VOTE AGAINST THAT WAS VERY CLEAR AT THE TIME IT WAS TO DO WITH THIS NARROW ISSUE OF PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BUT I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE I TOTALLY TOTALLY SUPPORT
EQUAL MARRIAGE IN LAW AND I AM PLAYING MY PART IN GOVERNMENT NOW TO CONTRIBUTE FOSTER A CLIMB IN A CULTURE OF TOLERANCE AND RESPECT I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN SOCIETY FEELING SECOND BEST WHETHER THAT'S TO DO WITH THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN OR THEIR SEXUALITY SO HOW WOULD YOU SUM UP YOUR VIEWS ON HOMOSEXUALITY WERE PRESUMABLY THEY'RE INFORMED BY YOUR CHRISTIAN FAITH IS IT IMMORAL
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BEING GAY IS A SIN I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING TO BE CURED I'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE THE QUOTE THAT I THINK THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT'S BEEN SICKLY TO THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA WAS ENTIRELY FABRICATED I'VE NEVER SAID ANYTHING AT ALL TO SUGGEST I HAVE EVER BELIEVED THAT I ENDORSE GAY CURE THERAPY THIS IS COMPLETE FALSEHOOD SPREAD BY POLITICAL OPPONENTS BUT THERE BUT AN ORGANISATION CALLED CHRISTIAN ACTION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CARE THROUGH WHOM YOU HAVE EMPLOYED INTO
HAS SPONSORED EVENTS WHICH REFER TO GAIN BISEXUAL PEOPLE ARE SEXUALLY BROKEN AND HAVE ADVOCATED THAT THEY CAN BECOME EX GAY DO YOU REGRET EMPLOYING INTERNS FROM THAT ORGANISATION MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES OVER THE YEARS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERN SCHEME THAT YOU REFERRED TO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS A VIEW THAT CARE HOLES IF HE'S I DON'T AGREE WITH IT I DO I FIND
THE IDEA THAT BEING GAY IS SOMETHING TO BE CURED THAT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT'S NEVER BEEN PART OF ANYTHING THAT I BELIEVE IS NOT CERTAINLY NOT PART OF MY CHRISTIAN OUTLOOK O.K. LET'S JUST FINALLY TALK ABOUT THAT THE CONTEST DO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH INTO THE LAST TWO BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU AND THERESA MAY IS THE IS THE OTHER ONE THEN THE WIDER CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE AFTERMATH OF A REFERENDUM RESULT LIKE THIS WILL BE OFFERED TO PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED REMAIN AS THEIR NEXT LEADER
# THIS ELECTION CONTEST HAS ALREADY TAKEN VERY INTERESTING TWISTS AND TURNS SO LET'S SEE WHAT THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE AFTER TONIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT AS WELL WE'LL SEE WHO THE LAST TWO UP AT ONE OF THE POINTS I'VE BEEN MAKING CONSISTENTLY THROUGH THIS CONTEST IS THAT IF WE TURN THIS CONTEST INTO BASICALLY A RERUN OF THE REFERENDUM WILL WE BASICALLY WANT TO HAVE ONE CANDIDATE FOR THE LEAVES SIDE ONE CANDIDATE FOR THE REMAIN SIDE THEN I TELL YOU WHAT WE RISK AND TRENCH IN THE DIVISION IN THE PARTY FOR A LONG LONG TIME TO COME I THINK WOULD BE A SERIOUS RISK
OF SPLITTING THE PARTY WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS LEADERSHIP ELECTION ABOUT THE FUTURE ABOUT A BROADER RANGE OF ISSUES AND VALUES OTHER THAN JUST THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US HAVE TAKEN BRITAIN OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO BRING TO THIS
LEADERSHIP CONTEST WHICH IS WHY I AM TALKING A LOT ABOUT SOME OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVISIONS IN OUR SOCIETY AND TRYING TO GET ALL OF THE CANDIDATES REALLY TO FOCUS ON ON A BIGGER AND WIDER SET OF ISSUES STEPHEN CRABB WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LISTENING TO THAT IS A POLITICAL EDITOR LAURA KINSBERG IT'LL BE FASCINATING TO SEE HOW THIS PANS OUT LAURA AND WHO ARE THE TWO WHO END UP BEING PUT TO THE WIDER BALLET
ABSOLUTELY WELL ONE CABINET MINISTER SAID TO ME LAST NIGHT MICHELLE THAT THERE TOO ON THE BALLOT WILL BE THERESA MAY AND ANDREA LETS SOME BUT I HAVE TO SAY WE ARE A LONG WAY OFF FROM THAT BECOMING A CERTAINTY IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS NOW I THINK WE CAN BE RELATIVELY SURE THERESA MAY WILL BE ONE OF THEM SHE'S GOT THE SUPPORT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN M. PEAS AS LAST NIGHT
WAY AHEAD OF MISSUS LEADS AND WHO'S ON THIRTY NINE BUT THE WAY THEY SAW WORKS AS A BIT OF A CAN OF SLOW MOVING VERSION OF IT'S A KNOCKOUT THE PERSON WHO COMES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLET TODAY DROPS OUT THE QUESTION IS OF COURSE WHERE DID THEIR VOTE THEN GO SO IT'S ONE OF THESE ELABORATE SYSTEMS THAT BECAUSE IT'S THIS SORT OF KNOCK OUT IT CAN BE QUITE UNPREDICTABLE BUT THE FAULT LINES ARE MANY AND VARIOUS YOU KNOW NOT JUST BETWEEN REMAIN AND I DON'T
BUT ALSO FOR EXAMPLE LISTENING TO STEPHEN CRABB THEY'RE FASCINATING THAT HE'S ADVOCATING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY THAT'S HUGELY IMPORTANT PRIORITY OF THIS GOVERNMENT ADVOCATING BORROWING TO INVEST TIME SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S PERFECTLY SENSIBLE OF COURSE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ON THE ON THE CONTEST LAW HOW MUCH AS ANDREA LET'S AND THEN HELP BY THE ENDORSEMENT OF OF BORIS JOHNSON
I THINK THAT WILL REALLY SORT OF GINGER UP HER SUPPORTERS AND I THINK THERE WAS ALREADY A REAL ENERGY IN THE ROOM AT HER LAUNCH IN WESTMINSTER YESTERDAY THERE IS REAL EXCITEMENT ABOUT HER ON THE EWER SET SCEPTIC SIDE OF THE PARTY I HAVE TO SAY BEING AT THE LODGE THERE A LOT OF THE SORT OF OPERATIVES WHO WERE AROUND AND IAIN DUNCAN SMITH'S ERA HE'S GONE TO HER CALLS SAYING THAT SHE IS THE REAL DEAL
BUT LAST NIGHT THERE WAS SOME REAL CONCERN AMONG EM PEAS ABOUT A LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW SHE'S A POPULAR PERSON IN THE PARTY SHE IS WELL LIKE BORIS JOHNSON'S SUPPORT WILL OF COURSE HELP HER BECAUSE IN THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND INDEED AT WESTMINSTER PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT HE THINKS PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT HE SAYS AND DOES
WHETHER THAT MAKES ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE LONGER TERM WE'LL HAVE TO SEE BUT I THINK IT WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED BY MICHAEL GOES WON'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY IT BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF HIS STANDING IT'S INTERESTING THEY ARE WAY BEHIND
MICHAEL GO STEAM DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ALL HOPE IS LOST THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD ON THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM THE FOX AND STEPHEN CRAP SUPPORTERS WHEN THEY ARE IF THEY DROP OUT AS EXPECTED AND IT'S THIS STRANGE SYSTEM WHERE ARE LOSERS SUPPORT MOVES ON TO OTHER AS THAT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO PREDICT THE RACCOONS SPOKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# THE TIME IS NOW TWENTY TWO MINUTES PAST EIGHT AT THE CHELTENHAM MUSIC FESTIVAL NEXT WEEK SOMETHING WILL BE ATTEMPTED THAT HE'S NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED IN BRITAIN BEFORE
IT SOUNDS SIMPLE THE PERFORMANCE OF A PIANO PIECE BUT THIS PIECE IS VEXATION ZE BY ERIC SARTI AND ALL THE SCORE COVERS JUST ONE PAGE THE COMPOSER SAID IT SHOULD BE PLAYED EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY TIMES VERY SLOWLY
THIRTY FIVE PIANISTS WILL PLAY IN RELAY OVER A TWENTY TWO HOUR PERIOD AND ONE OF THEM WILL BE THE PIANIST AND COMPOSER LOVETT WHO'S IN ANOTHER STUDIO IN THIS BUILDING A STUDIO WITH A PIANO FROM WHERE SHE JOINS US NOW GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THANK YOU FOR COMING ON CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VEXATION WHAT IS IT LIKE
WELL IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PIECE TO PLAY EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE OF MUSIC BUT BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE REPEATED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY TIMES AS YOU SAID IT CAN BE QUITE CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS ARE EVEN DINNER MUSIC IS QUITE SIMPLE HE WROTE IT IN VERY COMPLICATED WAY SO IT CAN DRIVE YOU CRAZY YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH LOADS OF VARIOUS EMOTIONS FROM
FEEDING MEDITATIVE TOO ANGRY SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT IT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT DESPITE WHAT YOU SAY OH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EXPERIENCE IT'S A CULT EVENT IN THE MAKING A NEW PLAYERS ARE JUST A LITTLE TASTE OF IT NOW SO WE GET SOME SET ABSOLUTELY
SIX NATIONS THERE AND LOVE IT I MEAN THIS IS WHAT I MEAN I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE CON THE REASONS FOR PLAYING AT NOW IS THAT IT'S A SORT OF CELEBRATION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS SINCE HIS BIRTH BUT HE WAS NOT POPULAR WAS RATHER AHEAD OF HIS TIME WASN'T IT HE WAS VERY MUCH AHEAD OF HIS TIME AND HE WAS HANGING OUT WITH ALL HIS FRIENDS FROM THE AVANT GARDE SEEING YOU KNOW PICASSO MEN RAY A LOT OF PEOPLE DID AND UP UPSETTING THE ESTABLISHMENT BUT SHE REALLY WAS THE FIRST ONE TO TWO SET OUT MUSIC TO FILM
YOU KNOW USING POPULAR MUSIC IN HE'S IN HIS WORKS AND IT'S QUITE FASCINATING THAT HE ENDED UP HE'S UPSETTING SO MANY PEOPLE OF THE FRENCH ESTABLISHMENT EVEN DEBUSSY WHO WAS HIS GREAT FRIEND ENDED UP FALLING APART AT SOME POINT I THINK EVERYBODY
THERE WAS A PROBLEM THAT WASN'T BECAUSE OF HIS MUSIC THERE WAS IT UM I THINK PART OF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW IN RELATION TO HIS MUSIC BECAUSE A LOT OF THE COMPOSERS WERE WRITING QUITE COMPLICATED MUSIC IN THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND SAID YOU CAME OUT WITH HIS YOU KNOW TAKING AWAY A LOT OF THE FLOURISH OF NECESSARY
PARTS OF IT AND WRITING QUITE SIMPLE MUSIC WHICH IN A FORD PART OF INTELLECTUAL ESTABLISHMENT WAS REALLY PROBLEMATIC THEY DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH SUCH SIMPLE MUSIC BUT YET AFTER HIS DEATH MANY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH IT WAS SORT OF PICKED UP ON THIS PARTICULAR PIECE I KNOW JOHN CAGE PICKED IT UP AND PLAYED IN NEW YORK
YES I MEAN THAT IS FASCINATING AND HE DIDN'T HAVE THE PREMIERE WAS DON IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE IN NEW YORK AND JUST IMAGINE IT WAS SUCH A BIG EVENT YOU HAD ALL THE ARTISTS OF THE DAY IS THE ACTORS CAME AROUND IT WAS PUBLICISED WAS A HUGE ANTI WAR HALL WAS IN THE AUDIENCE AND JUN KEL OF DE VELVET LATER FORMED A VELVET UNDERGROUND PERFORMED IT ON ON THOSE TWENTY HOURS OR SO AND THERE BUT IT HAS BEEN TRIED HERE WHAT HASN'T IT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION IT WAS TRIED A FEW YEARS AGO AT THE LEEDS MUSIC FESTIVAL UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE FIRE REGULATIONS CAN YOU BELIEVE IT AFTER SIXTEEN HOURS
THEY HAD TO STOP I MEAN THEY WERE SO CLOSE TO MANAGING TO GET TO THE END OF IT BUT THEY HAD TO STOP BECAUSE OF THE FIRE REGULATIONS SO THAT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL AND CAN I ASK YOU HOW IS IT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE AS WE SAY IT'S A RELAY I THINK IT'S WHAT THIRTY FIVE PIANIST EVEN MORE EVEN MORE REAL ORESTE PIANISTS BUT HOW DO YOU HAND OVER TO EACH OTHER
WELL WE'RE GOING TO DO IT INSIDE FOR MY PART I WOULD BE PLAYING TWO HOURS DURING THE NIGHT WHICH I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT TO BE PLAYING AT NIGHT TIME AND YOU CAN BRING YOUR BEAN BAG OR YOUR SLEEPING BAG AND IT'S A VERY RELAXED ATMOSPHERE ON ATMOSPHERE THAT WOULD HAVE FITTED SET HIS EXPECTATIONS AS YOU DON'T HAVE A SLEEPOVER
I MEDITATE YOU MUST OTHERWISE YOU'LL BREAK THE RELAY CAN I ASK YOU HERE HE IS BETTER KNOWN FOR ANOTHER PIECE OF MUSIC AND CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A TASTE OF I WANT INTRODUCE IT JUST THE MUSIC WE'RE DO IT

# IT'S NOW TWENTY SIX MINUTES TO NINE THERE HAVE BEEN ALL SORTS OF WARNINGS ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY NOW THAT THE U.K. HAS VOTED TO LEAVE THE E.U. BUT HERE FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A WEEK TODAY WHEN HE PUBLISHES THE BANK'S FINANCIAL STABILITY REPORT IT'S EXPECTED TO SPELL OUT IN MORE DETAIL THE RISKS WE FACED SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ALREADY THERE WELL TO HAVE IT
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I'M JOINED IN THE STUDIO BY STEPHANIE FLANDERS WHO IS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGY STRATEGIST FOR U.K. AND EUROPE AT JADE MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SITTING ALONGSIDE HER ANDREW LEILA CO WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF EUROPE ECONOMICS AND CHAIR THE ASTUTE FOR ECONOMIC AFFAIRS SHADOW MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH
LET'S START WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY REFER TO WE SO OFTEN IMMEDIATELY GO TO FOR EXAMPLE THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED STEPHANIE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY IT FELL HEAVILY ON THE DAY AFTER OR THE DAY OF THE RESULTS CAME OUT BUT THEN HE'S BACK UP TO WHERE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY AND IT DIDN'T DO THAT BADLY EVEN THE DAY AFTERWARDS AND HAS BEEN IN SORT OF DOMESTIC CAR IN HOME CURRENCY TERMS IT'S BEEN THE BEST PERFORMING STOCK MARKET IN THE WORLD IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO I THINK THAT'S A SHOWS YOU THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE ECONOMY AND THE VAST BULK OF REVENUES OF FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED
BIG EXPORTING COMPANIES AND COMPANY'S OIL COMPANIES OTHERS THAT HAVE ALL OF THEIR REVENUES ABROAD THEY ALL BENEFITED AUTOMATICALLY FROM THE FACT THAT THE FAULT THE STIRLING THE POUND WAS TUMBLING THE DAY AFTER THE REFERENDUM AND HE'S NOW DOWN NEAR FF WHAT'S NEAR THIRTY YELLOWS YES AND HE'D HAVE FALLEN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN RESPONSE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE REFERENDUM SO THAT PARTICULAR BIT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S MAYBE CONFUSE PEOPLE
WE ASSOCIATE CRISIS NOW WITH SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS CRISIS THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I DON'T THINK THE IMPACT OF THIS WAS EVER GOING TO BE LIKE THAT YOU CERTAINLY HAVE HAD A VERY BIG REACTION ON THE POUND AND THAT DOES TELL YOU THAT THE MARKET IS IN SOME SENSE DOWNGRADING BRITAIN'S PROSPECTS IN THE FUTURE
BUT ACTUALLY DAY TODAY WE'RE NOT IT'S GOING TO BE INVESTMENTS NOT HAPPENING AND DEALS NOT BEING DONE THINGS BEING PUT ON HOLD WHICH IS HARD TO SEE HARD TO MEASURE AND DOESN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE O.K. CRISIS IN THE SAME WHY DO YOU MAKE THE POINT ABOUT THE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED OF COURSE THE NEXT RAFT OF COMPANIES THAT FOOTSIE TWO FIFTY WHICH STARTS PRESUMABLY FROM ONE HUNDRED MORE ONE AND WHAT DO THEY SHOW SHOULD WE BE LOOKING I THINK THAT'S A BIT OF A CONFUSION IS LIKE COS THE FOOTSIE TO FIFTY IS ACTUALLY PARTICULAR INDEX WHICH IS JUST
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES THAT ARE MORE DOMESTICALLY FOCUSED AND ANY REPRESENTS ACTUALLY ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE WHOLE OF THE STOCK MARKET VALUE THE WHOLE U.K. STOCK MARKET IS STILL DOMINATED BY THOSE FOOTSIE ONE HUNDRED O.K. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTY TO FIFTY THAT'S DOING ABOUT SEVEN PER CENT THAT'S IF IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S HOLDINGS OF PENSION FUNDS AND ELSEWHERE THAT'S A FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE U.K. STOCK MARKET IT'S QUITE A SMALL PROPORTION BUT YES COME INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AT THOSE COMPANIES SAYING
WELL THE ECONOMY CERTAINLY GOING TO SLOW DOWN THERE ARE LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE POT SECTORS PARTICULARLY THINGS LIKE HOME BUILDERS HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT THOSE KIND OF COMPANIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND HAD A LOOK AT WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THE DECISION
WELL OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE FALL IN THE POUND THE POUND SPAWN SOMETHING LIKE TEN PER CENT ON THE TRADE WEIGHTED BASES SINCE LAST DECEMBER MOVEMENTS AND STOCKS I WOULD IF I'D BE INTERESTED IN WHETHER THE WHETHER YOU HAD ANY MOVEMENTS IN BANK WHERE BOND YIELDS SO IF PEOPLE STARTED TO BE SUSPICIOUS THAT PERHAPS PREPARE PROBLEMS WE'VE SEEN PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE IN THE EUROZONE ITALIAN BANKS FOR AIR OF SHARE PRICES FALLING AND SO ON AND THE SUGGESTIONS OF EVEN ITALIAN BANK BAIL OUT WHETHER SOME PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE MIGHT LEAD TO
TENSIONS WITHIN THE FACTS A SYSTEM WHICH MIGHT MEAN THAT BANK BOND HE'LL STARTED TO RISE SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IT MIGHT MEAN THE BANKS ADDED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT LENDING MONEY TO EACH OTHER WHICH IS THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY OH EIGHT AND BEGAN IN TWENTY TEN ELEVEN IN THE PERIOD OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS NOT REALLY ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY THAT ANYTHING OF THAT SORT GOING ON AT THE MOMENT REALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE
THE FOOTSIE MOVEMENTS AIR FOOTSIES UP A LITTLE BIT THE FOOTSIE TO FIFTY YEARS OF FAIRLY VOLATILE INDEX THE KIND AFORE THAT WE'VE SEEN NOW IT'S ONLY ABOUT THE SAME AS HAPPENED IN LATE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT ED MILIBAND MIGHT TO WIN THE GENERAL ELECTION SO WHAT WE'VE HAD IS QUITE MODEST MOVEMENTS THUS FAR THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WON'T HAVE MORE SIGNIFICANT THINGS IN THE FUTURE BUT OTHER THAN THE MOVEMENT IN THE POUND IT'S BEEN QUITE LARGE AND QUITE MODEST OH KAY A NEW AT SEVEN MAKE THE POINT IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
MEAN THE THING AND JOURNALISTICALLY IT'S A CHALLENGE COS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FILM PEOPLE NOT DOING DEALS OR DECIDING TO PUT INVESTMENT ELSEWHERE WE HAVE HAD SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS ACTUALLY WE HAD RYANAIR ANNOUNCE IT WAS HAD ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INVESTMENT WAS GOING TO PUT IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES I THINK AGAIN I THINK TO LOOK FOR A SORT OF LEHMAN STYLE SORT OF SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL FEELING I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ALTHOUGH THE MOVE IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE THIS FLATTENING OF PROSPECTS ARE ECONOMY WAS ALREADY SLOWING DOWN
THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT'S GOING TO SLOW MUCH FURTHER THAT STARTS TO GET NEARS ZERO SO ONE COULD FIND ONESELF FALLING INTO RECESSION BY JUST A FLATTENING OF PROSPECTS INVESTMENT BEING TAKEN AWAY BUT THAT'S MORE OF A SLOW BURN WILL ALSO SEE INFLATION OBVIOUSLY PICK UP THE KIND OF A FALL IN THE PAN AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY LOOK THERE ARE UPSIDES YOU STIRLING STIRLING DROPS IT CAN BE GOOD NEWS WHEN DO WE SEE THE EFFECT OF ALL THIS IS THE ONLY WHEN WE GET THE G.D.P. FIGURES SO
SO CLEARLY IF THEY'D MOVEMENT IN STERLING IT COULD POTENTIALLY BOOST EXPORTS AND THAT MIGHT MEAN A MOVEMENT OF TEN PER CENT YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING OF THE ORDER OF POINT THREE TO POINT SIX EXTRA G.D.P. AFTER ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS NOW THAT MAY WELL BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY SLOWING DOWN INVESTMENT OF COURSE IT'S DRIVEN BY A SENTIMENT TONIGHT'S ANYTHING I THINK THAT THERE IS NO I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE MUCH IN THE DATA THAT YOU CAN INTERPRET AS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH BREAKS IT SUPPOSED TO OTHER KINDS OF ATTENTION'S THERE'VE BEEN SOME ISSUES WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY TURNING DOWN FROM LATE LAST YEAR
AND OF COURSE THE U.K. IS QUITE EXPOSED TO GLOBAL TRADE AND THERE WAS ALL THE DISCUSSION AT THE TURN OF THE ABOUT THE COCKTAIL OF RISKS IF YOU'LL RECALL THAT GEORGE OSBORNE MENTION AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO THE U.K. WAS SLOWING DOWN ANYWAY HOW MUCH EXTRA WE CAN INTERPRET AS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH BRICKS IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TO SEE FOR SOME TIME IF YOU EXCEPT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORECAST FOR ECONOMY MOST ECONOMISTS HAVE TAKEN OFF GLOBALLY HAVE TAKEN ABOUT ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OF OUR GROWTH RATE MAY HAVE NOT DONE THAT TO ANY OTHER COUNTRY SO I THINK THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT HIT TO THE U.K. ECONOMY WHICH IS ENTIRELY
OUR OWN MAKING IT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THIS WARNING FROM THE BANK GOVERNOR THAT LOOK INTEREST RATES HE'S READY TO DROP THEM FURTHER SHE SCARCELY SEEMS POSSIBLE BUT
I THINK THEY WILL THEY HAVE A SIGNAL PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THEY WILL DO MORE THERE IS SOME RELUCTANCE TO TAKE THAT BASE RATE THAT'S BEEN AT HALF SEVEN SO LONG EVEN LOWER BUT THEY MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE BIT LOWER I THINK OUT THE MORE LIKELY THAT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SEE IS SOME OF THE THINGS WE SAW BEFORE JUST A BOOST FROM BY BUYING GOVERNMENT BONDS QUANTITATIVE EASING THINGS LIKE THAT EXTRA FUNDING FOR LENDING CHANGES TO THE CAPITAL BUFFETS WITH THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE SEE TODAY ANDREW ALECKO STEPHANIE FLANDERS THANK YOU
# IT'S A NINETEEN MINUTES TO NINE IN THE NINE DAYS AFTER THE REFERENDUM RESULT NEARLY SIX HUNDRED HATE CRIMES WERE REPORTED TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE A TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE ON THE FIGURES FOR THIS TIME LAST YEAR
OTHER POLICE FORCES INCLUDING AVON AND SOMERSET POLICE HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE SEEING A TROUBLESOME RISE IN THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS IT'S PROMPTED THE HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE TO LAUNCH AN INQUIRY INTO HATE CRIME AND ITS CONSEQUENCES OR THE NATIONAL POLICE CHIEF'S COUNCIL LEAD ON HATE CRIMES IS ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE MARK HAMILTON AND HE'S IN OUR BELFAST STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS INCREASES LINKED TO THE RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE REFERENDUM HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON HATE CRIME REPORTING AND SO I THINK THERE'S DINNER TO STRAND TO THAT THE FIRST THING IS
AT TIMES OF HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND PATENT INTEREST WE DO SEE AN UPTURN REPORTING ON THIS DISTANCE NOT EXCLUSIVE JUST TO THE REFERENDUM SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE REFERENDUM AND INCREASED REPORTING THAT THE SLIGHTLY MORE UNCLEAR PIECE IS
IS THERE MORE HATE CRIME AS A RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT GIVEN THE SPIKE THAT WE SAW IT LAST WEEK AND GIVEN SOME OF THE INCREASE IS THAT SOME PLAY SERVICES ARE EXPERIENCING NOT ALL HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE REFERENDUM WILL GIVE A LICENCE TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY EXTREME VIEWS TO VENT THOSE MORE VOCALLY OBVIOUSLY THAN THEY HAD BEFORE SO I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS THERE IS AN INCREASED IN REPORTING GENERALLY THROUGH AWARENESS
AND IT PROBABLY HAS BEEN AN INCREASE AND SOME OF THE BEHAVIOURS AS WELL WHAT SOME OF VICTIMS HAVE SAID AT THAT AFTER BEING AT THE SHARP END OF THIS IS THAT IT SEEMS THAT AT LEAST SOME PEOPLE FEEL IT IS O.K. NOW TO BE A RACIST IN THIS COUNTRY
WELL FIRST OF ALL OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT IT NEVER HAS BEEN IT'S APPALLING US DISGUSTING REPREHENSIBLE BEHAVIOUR AS LORD TO DEAL WITH THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH AND I THINK ALSO TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST A LOT OF THIS BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A WHILE
MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER REPORTED IN THE PAST ONE ALLOW SPOKEN YOUR PROGRAMME WE TALKED ABOUT UNDER REPORTING AND LISTERS BEHAVIOUR JUST DIDN'T
JUST DON'T START LAST WEEK AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED FOR A LONG TIME SO YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT I MEAN SOAP SO MUCH OF THIS IS IN THE STREET IT'S DRIVE BY IT'S THE KIND OF THING WHICH REALISTICALLY HOW I MEAN HOW YOU WOULD ACTUALLY TACKLED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE INCIDENTS AS HARD TO SEE YEAH I THINK THERE'S TWO BEST TOURIST THERE'S THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPONSE TO THIS AND THEN THERE'S A SOCIETAL RESPONSE
SO FROM A CRIMINAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE IN A WHAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FIRSTLY PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE TO REPORT THIS MATTER TO THE POLICE SERVICES SECONDLY THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO PLAY SERVICES RESPOND AND A VERY PROACTIVE WAY THERE HAS BEEN GREAT DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN THIS JURISDICTION AROUND DEVELOPING RESPONSES THAT WAS CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE C.P.S. AND WERE VERY GOOD AT NOW COMPARED TO WHEN WE WERE IN THE PAST AND DEALING WITH US AND COMPARED TO OTHER
OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND EUROPE AROUND THE WORLD WE ARE FAR MORE ATTRACTIVE AT DEALING WITH THIS SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FOLLOW UP TO THE EXTENT THAT VICTIMS OF OF THESE CRIMES WOULD WANT TO SEE BECAUSE THAT'S AT THE HEART OF HAVING CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH IT WHETHER WE DO SEE PROSECUTIONS RESULTING AT LEAST FROM SOME OF THESE REPORTED INCIDENTS AT THE RESOURCES EITHER THESE KREMES STATISTICALLY
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL CRIME REPORTER THAN IN THE U.K. ON A DAILY WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS SO THERE ARE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES THEY DID TAKE AN ENHANCED RESPONSE AND THERE ARE THE RED THERE IS COMPREHENSIVE ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES TO POLICE SERVICES AROUND THE U.K. ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH HIS ABSENCE AND THERE HAS BEEN A SPECIAL EFFORT MADE BY THE POLICE SERVICE
AND BY THE C.P.S. TO DRESS AS YOU KNOW WHATEVER I WAS IT WAS COORDINATING WITH MY COLLEAGUES AROUND THE COUNTRY ON FRIDAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING FROM ALL POLICE SERVICES ARE IN THE U.K. THAT THESE OFFENCES NEED ADDITIONAL ATTENTION PLAY SERVICES AND EDITION RESPONSE FOR VICTIMS ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE MARK HAMILTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH
# IT'S QUARTER TO NINE FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS THERE'S SOME TURBULENCE AHEAD FOR THE BRITISH AIRWAYS PENSION SCHEME DOMINIC O'CONNELL HAS MORE DOMINIC DOMINIC THAT EXCUSE ME THANKS
BRITISH AIRWAYS IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A GIANT PINCH THE SKIN THERE JUST HAPPENS TO RUN AN AIRLINE AND WHILE THAT'S A JOKE THERE IS SOME TRUTH AND THE COMPANIES TO BUY BIG PENSION SCHEMES HAVE COMBINED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ABOUT TWENTY BILLION POUNDS AND THE COMPANY STOCK MARKET HE WAS ONLY EIGHT BILLION POUNDS
THERE'S A BIG MILESTONE EVERY THREE YEARS IN THESE PENSION SCHEMES ABOUT HOW THEY ARE BELLY THAN THE COMPANY HAS JUST SAID IT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO AGREE A VALUATION WITH THE TRUSTEES BY THE DEADLINE WHICH WAS THE END OF LAST MONTH IT TOLD US IN THE STATEMENT THAT IT WOULD GIVE AN UPDATE ABOUT ABOUT THE VALUATION WHEN IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO SO AND WITH SAY NOTHING MORE
CAPTAIN MIKE POSTERS OXFORD STUDIO HE STOPPED FLYING JUMBO JETS FOR B. A. SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO HE'S A PENSIONER AND HE'S BEEN A VOCAL CAMPAIGNER FOR MEMBERS OF THE AIRLINE PENSION SCHEMES MIKE YOU TELL ME JUST HOW UNUSUAL IS IT FOR A COMPANY LIKE A BIG COMPANY LIKE B.A. NOT TO MEET THIS THREE YEARLY VALUATION DEADLINE
WELL GOOD MORNING DOMINIC I HAVEN'T BEEN A TRUSTY NOW FOR FIVE YEARS WHEN I RESIGNED WHEN THE C.P.I. WAS INTRODUCED AS THE INFLATION INDEXED SO I'M NOT
TOTALLY SURE HOW MANY BIG COMPANIES HAVE MISSED THEIR DEADLINE BUT I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY RARE EVENT EMPERORS I DON'T I JUST ACTUALLY EXPAND A BIT BECAUSE BRITISH AIRWAYS HAS TO FINAL SALARY PENSION SCHEME THAN U.S. PENSION SCHEME AND THE AIRWAYS PENSION SCHEME THE AIRWAYS PENSION SCHEME IS
A PRETTY HEALTHY SCHEME AND THE WHERE HIS PENSION SCHEME IS THE SCHEME THAT HAS THE LARGE DEFICIT AND AND THE ONE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AGREE ON BUT THIS BACKGROUND THERE'S THERE'S BAD BLOOD HERE ISN'T THERE MIGHT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEES AND IT'S GOING TO COURT IN OCTOBER IT'S ALL ABOUT
HOW GENEROUS THE BENEFITS ARE PAID TO RETIRED B.A. STAFF INDEED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN B.A. WAS BEING PREPARED FOR PRIVATISATION
EMPLOYEES WERE PROMISED HE WOULD RECEIVE A P.I. PROTECTED PENSIONS IF THEY STAYED IN THE AIRWAYS PENSION SCHEME HALF THE EMPLOYEES STAYED IN THE PENSION SCHEME EXPECTING A P.I. INCREASES
WHEN THE INCREASES WERE CHANGED TO C.P.I. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE TRUSTEES TOOK A DECISION THAT THEY WOULD RETURN TO A P.I. INCREASES TO AS THE UNDERTAKING WE GIVEN BY BRITISH AIRWAYS IN NICE EIGHTY FOUR AND THEY STARTED TO DO THIS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND BRITISH AIRWAYS RESPONSE WAS TO SUE THE TRUSTEES AND TRY AND MAKE THEM INDIVIDUALLY PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF THE CASE AND THE CASE GOES TO THE HIGH COURT IN THE TWENTY SIXTH OF OCTOBER
THIS YEAR AND IS EXPECTED TO LAST FOR SIX WEEKS THE LAST CASE I WAS INVOLVED WITH A TWO THOUSAND TO FIVE DAYS' COST SIX MILLION POUNDS IN COSTS IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION WHERE A COMPANY YOU SEWING AT SAME PENSION TRUSTEES THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAPTAIN MIKE POST
# DOMINIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S TWELVE MINUTES TO NINE WHEN THE CHILCOT INQUIRY FINALLY REPORTS TOMORROW ON THE IRAQ WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH THERE'LL BE AN INTENSE FOCUS ON TONY BLAIR BEING ABLE TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE HIM TO TASK OVER IRAQ IS THOUGHT TO BE PART OF WHY JEREMY CORBIN HAS BEEN HOLDING FAST AGAINST THE CHALLENGE TO HIS LEADERSHIP
ALICE MAHON IS A FORMER LABOUR M.P. A MEMBER OF STOP THE WAR AND SEE INDIAN OR LONG TERM CRITIC OF THE IRAQ WAR SHE'S IN A LEAD STUDIO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING DO YOU SEE THE CHILCOTT REPORT AS AN OPPORTUNITY
YES I DO I THINK THE TRUTH MIGHT COME OUT I HOPE WE GET SOME JUSTICE FROM ITS PUBLICATION BUT I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH WAS VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN HER POOLS IN THERE WANNA PUT DOWN THE FIRST EARLY DAY MOTION BORN IN THAT BLAIR WANTED TO GO TO WAR AND THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO A YEAR BEFORE I CHAIRED THE I THOUGHT
I'LL PARTY IRAQ LIAISON GROUP AND WE HAD ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE HOUSE BUT THE BLUE TEAM AND THE ORGANISATION AGAINST EM PLEASE SOAK WILL EVEN WAVERING WAS FORMIDABLE
MY HIM THEY'VE MESSED AND PEAS ON A PERSONAL BASIS TWO OR THREE AT A TIME I MET HIM AT UNDER DINNER SHOUT TOO MUCH HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO GO TO WAR AND HE HAD A FORMIDABLE MACHINE IN PARLIAMENT HELP AND I'VE NOT
BRING ABOUT THE MASSIVE PROPAGANDA EXERCISE WHICH CLEARLY WITH ALL THOSE CLAIMS ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND IF TOMORROW AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT TONY BLAIR APOLOGISES WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR YOU NO IT WON'T THE ENORMITY OF THAT DECISION
MEANT A COUNTRY WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND ARE LIVING IN MISERY MILLIONS OF REFUGEES AND IT ALSO LED TO IN MY VIEW TO THE BIRTH OF ISIS
WHAT TONY BLAIR HAS SAID SUBSEQUENTLY IS THAT HE ADMITS THAT HE UNDER HE AND OTHERS UNDERESTIMATED PROFOUNDLY THE FORCES THAT WERE AT WORK IN THE REGION HE HE DIDN'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL TOLD HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AFTERWARDS IS SERIOUSLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MASSIVE PROPAGANDA EXERCISE THAT WAS THAT MISLED M.P.S AND THE SET OUT TO MISLEAD AND PLEASE A LOVELY AND PIECE SUCH AS GERALDINE SMITH HAVE BEEN ANTI WERE OUR LIFE WAS CONVINCED THAT
ARRGH SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD THOSE WEAPONS AND HE DIDN'T AND THERE WAS PLENTY WHATEVER WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE SO KNOTTED NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT HE HAD THEM AT THAT I DID THAT THEY HAD NO EVIDENCE AND IF THEY DIDN'T LET THE TEAM THAT WAS INVESTIGATED IT DO IT RIGHT IT WAS
IT WAS AN ENORMOUS DECISION LED TO LOTS AND LOTS OF MYSTERY AND I DO THINK TONY BLAIR IS PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THAT YOU ENDED UP LEAVING THE LABOUR PARTY AND BUY ASSUMED THIS WAS A BIG PART OF THAT YES IT WAS IT WAS WHERE THEY KEPT DEPLORING
TROOPS WERE YOU NO I WON'T WHY DON'T WON'T TRIED HER WHY HAVEN'T YOU REJOIN THE PARTY UNTIL I HAVE BRIDGEND THE PARTING TO JEREMY CARBON I HAVE A VOTED FOR JEREMY AND HAVE COME TEN YOU'RE VOTING FOR JEREMY JEREMY IS NOT A FAILURE THIS THIS TURNING ON HIM AT THE TIME WHEN THE TORIES IN SUCH DISARRAY I THINK IT'S CRUEL AND IT'S SHAMEFUL I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIOUR AND IF HE'S ABOUT
CHARISMA WELL ATTLEE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHARISMA BUT HE BROUGHT IN THE BIGGEST CHANGE TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR I JUST THINK IT'S MADE UP I THINK THE TIME MINISTER HELP PLAYER AND THE TIMING OF THE LEADERSHIP CERTAINLY DO WE CERTAINLY DO WHY DIDN'T THE BRIGITTE
AFTER THE ELECTIONS MANDY JEREMY WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE ELECTIONS OF ME EXPECTANT MOTHER BROUGHT IT STRAIGHT OFF THE REFERENDUM RESULT WAS WHAT TIMING WHEN THE TORIES AND THE WORST
STATE OF DISARRAY SINCE THEY GOT ELECTED SIX YEARS AGO O.K. ALISON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING TO US
# IT'S NOW EIGHT MINUTES TO NINE EXCUSE ME THE ATTACK AND HOSTAGE TAKING AT A CAFE POPULAR WITH FOREIGNERS AND IN THE BANGLADESHI CAPITAL DAKAR LAST WEEKEND WAS SHOCKING
TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING ITALIANS JAPANESE AND U.S. CITIZENS IT'S NOW EMERGED THAT THE ATTACKERS WERE WELL EDUCATED ONE OF THEM WAS THE SON OF A POLITICIAN FROM THE GOVERNING PARTY THE B. B. C. SAINT JOY MY JUMJA SENT THIS REPORT
THE ATTACK ON THE POPULAR TARKA CAFE FILLED WITH EXPATS AND WILLIE BUNGA SHE'S SEVEN GUNMEN STORMED IN AND TOOK MORE THAN TWENTY PEOPLE HOSTAGE
SEPARATING THE FOREIGNERS FOR THE NEXT ELEVEN HOURS BEHELD THE SECURITY FORCES HAD BE AT FIRST POLICE HAD A VERY HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE ENTIRE SITUATION SHANA SIR DICKIE IS A FRIEND OF THE OWNERS
FROM WHAT I'VE UNDERSTOOD IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT A RANDOM ACT IT WAS VERY PLANNED AND THESE PEOPLE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHY THEY WERE DOING
THE FOCUS IS NOW SHIFTING TO THE ATTACKERS EYEWITNESSES DESCRIBED THEM AS ENGLISH SPEAKING AND POLISHED THE BUNDLE OF THIS PRIME MINISTER'S ADVISER SAYS MOST OF THEM CAME FROM AFFLUENT BACKGROUNDS MANY OF THEM ARE EDUCATED
GLASS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE WITH THE DANGERS OF ISLAMIC INSPIRATION PERHAPS IT GIVES SUBSTANCE TO OUR
FEELING THAT THOSE THEY'RE THE SECTION OF PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH WE'VE NEVER REGARD AS HIGHLY TO THE IDEA
OFFER SECULAR PLURAL DEMOCRATIC BAND
AND STANDING IN FRONT OF A VERY IMPRESSIVE GREY BUILDING WITH THE BRICK WALL COVERED WITH CREEPERS
THERE'S A SCHOLASTIC ARE ONE OF THE CITY'S TOP PRIVATE SCHOOLS IT'S WHERE THE CITY THEY STUDY NOW TWO OF THE ATTACKERS WENT TO SCHOOL HERE
ONE OF THEM IT'S RON INTAE OTHERS MOTHER TEACHERS HERE AND WHOSE FATHER IS THE GOVERNING PARTY POLITICIAN
I'M STUNNED TO LEARN THIS DUMBFOUNDED ROMANS FATHER IMTIAZ HAND FILED A MISSING PERSONS REPORT IN HIS LOCAL POLICE STATION LAST JANUARY HE TOLD US THAT HE ONLY REALISED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER SON WHEN HE SAW THIS PICTURE FLASHED ALL OVER THE MEDIA
THERE WAS NOTHING AT HOME NOT BOOKS ON ANYTHING TO INDICATE HE WAS LEANING THAT YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED MAYBE TO THEIR INTERNET
TO FIND OUT MORE I TRY AND FIND SOMEONE WHO KNEW ANY OF THE ATTACKERS AT FIRST NO ONE WANTED TO SPEAK
FINALLY ONE PERSON HAD SEEN ONE OF THEM ATE AS UNIVERSITY AND READ TO TALK BUT ONLY OVER THE FORM
CASKET WHATEVER YOU CAN I NEW NIPPER AL ISLAM ONE OF THE ATTACKERS I'D SEEN HIM ON CAMPUS HE APPEARED NORMAL JUST LIKE ALL OF US RADICAL GROUPS APPROACH MANY STUDENTS IN MY UNIVERSITY AT FIRST THEY SIMPLY ASKED THEM IF THEY PRAY THEN THEY SAY THIS IS NO LIFE JOIN THE JIHAD
A NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN ARE SAID TO HAVE DISAPPEARED IN BUNG ADDITION RECENT YEARS MANY OF THEM FROM MIDDLE CLASS BACKGROUNDS THE FEAR IS THAT SOME OF THEM MAY ALSO HAVE JOINED ISLAMIST GROUPS IT'S A DISTURBING DEVELOPMENT IN THIS MUSLIM MAJORITY NISH
# SAINT JOIN MY GENDER IT'S NOW FIVE MINUTES TO NINE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE THAT THERESA MAY AND AND ANDREA LEAD SOME COULD BE THE FINAL TWO CANDIDATES IN THE TORY RACE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HILLARY CLINTON'S LEAD IN THE POLLS AND HE'LL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE MOST POWERFUL HE'D WHEN EUROPE IS ANGELA MERKEL AND THERE ARE ALSO WOMEN HEADING UP THE I.M.F. AND THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE GARDEN JANET YELLAND RESPECTIVELY THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN POWERFUL POLITICAL POSITIONS
IS UNPRECEDENTED WELL I'M JOINED HERE IN THE STUDIO BY AMA COWBOY WHOSE PUBLIC POLICY EDITOR AT THE ECONOMIST AND IN WESTMINSTER IS THE GUARDIAN COLUMNIST ZOE WILLIAMS GOOD MORNING TO YOU GOOD MORNING I'M A COVER WHAT IS GOING ON I MEAN THIS WAS SEEMED ALMOST UNTHINKABLE A FEW YEARS AGO
WELL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE A FEW YEARS AGO IN ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS POSITIVELY THAT THE PARTIES AND BIG INSTITUTIONS ARE FINALLY PUSHING THOSE WOMEN FROM THE MIDDLE FROM WHAT THEY ON THE PIPELINE AS IT IS IF WE WERE KIND OF OIL TO THE TOP OF ORGANISATION FOR THE OTHER ONE WHICH I THINK POSSIBLY REFLECTS THE CONDITIONS IN BRITAIN AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WHEN THINGS GET REALLY TRICKY
A LOT OF MEN THEN FALL TO ONE SIDE OR FIGHT EACH OTHER TO A STANDSTILL IT GOES REALLY MESSED UP AND THEN THEY CALL FOR THE WOMEN SOMETHING THERE LISTENERS MAY THINK THAT'S QUITE A LOT LIKE THE REST OF LIFE VERY WE'RE GHOSTIE FIRED WITHOUT ARGUING
EVERY SINEW IN MY BODY RESISTS IT BUT THERE IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A KIND OF HYSTERICAL MASCULINE AND SOME TO BRITISH POLITICS AT THE MOMENT WHERE YOU KNOW MCDONNELL IS CALLING CORBIN A MAN OF STEEL AND GO VIZ SAYING I CAN STAND UP TO PUTIN COS I STOOD UP TO JOHNSON AND IT'S SORT OF STUPEFYING AND IT'S AS IF THE ENLIGHTENMENT NEVER HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING AND I THINK MAYBE IT'S TRUE THAT THAT KIND OF BINARY IDIOTIC
ARM WRESTLING DID STYLE OF DEBATE DOES CALL FOR WOMEN BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE HAD TIME REALLY TO KIND OF BUILD UP THEY'RE THERESA MAY AND ANDREA HAD SOME WOMEN ARE JUST AS CAPABLE OF SORT OF DOING DAFT THINGS SAYING STUPID THINGS MAKING MISTAKES AS MEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY DON'T TEND TO DO THAT KIND OF A CENTRALISING I AM STRONG BECAUSE I AM
A MAN THING I DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T KNOW I AM WOMAN HEAR ME AND I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE A POINT I THINK THE WAY THAT WOMEN DEPLOY RHETORIC AND I THINK WE WERE ALWAYS A BIT CAREFUL ABOUT COLLECT ADVISING WOMEN SORT OF FARM ANIMALS BUT IT IS THIS TRUE I THINK THAT PERHAPS THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE WEIGHS A BIT MORE STRONGLY WITH THEM SO IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE TREES UM AYE SHE POSITIONED HER SO SHE'S REALLY RATHER SCEPTICAL PERSON ON THE E.U. BUT SHE POSITIONED HERSELF JUST ABOUT IN REMAIN
SO NOW SHE'S ABLE TO SORT OF COVER THAT MIDDLE GROUND SOME PEOPLE WON'T LIKE THAT AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE KIND A MAN OF STEEL IN OR OUT RHETORIC THAT ZOE WAS JUST DISCUSSING THERE BUT IT DOES HAVE AN UGLY MERKEL'S ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE NO ONE'S EVER SHOW WHICH SIDE SHE'S ON SHE'S PROBABLY ABOUT TO RUN FOR A FOURTH TERM NO LESS OR AT LEAST CONSIDER IT SO I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING WELL POSITIONED THERE BUT IT IS INTERESTING WHITE SUDDENLY SHOULD FLARE UP ALL THIS RHETORIC IS NOT REALLY PARTICULARLY HELPING IS IT CORBIN STILL GOT
ANGELA EAGLE VERY LIGHTLY EAT IT TO COME OUT AGAINST HIM QUITE SOON AND THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY THE BIG BEASTS THIS SILVERBACK GORILLAS OF BORIS JOHNSON AND AND OTHERS US HAVE HAD REAL STRUGGLES DAVID CAMERON FELL BY THE WAYSIDE AND THAT THEN LET'S WINDING THROUGH THE GAP IF THEY'RE READY TO TAKE THE CHANCE COS WE HAD THIS REMARKABLE SITUATION WHERE OF COURSE IT'S NOT JUST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY COULD HAVE ANGELA EAGLE AT THE DROP OF IT WITH A NECKLACE DIRGE OF COURSE AT THE TOP THE S.N.P. RUTH DAVIDSON A CONSERVATIVE
LEANNE WOOD REALLY A WHOLE RAFT OF SENIOR WOMEN WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE DO YOU THINK ZOE WELL I THINK IT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE WAY DEBATE IS DONE I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT ASSUMING THAT ALL WOMEN ARE FEMINISTS AND INDEED THAT ALL WOMEN THINK THE SAME THING I WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHED TWO DAYS AGO TO HERE A B.B.C. REPORTER SAY EVEN THOUGH THERESA MAY AND ANGIE ARE LED SOME ARE BOTH WOMEN THEY DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING
IT'S REALLY GOBSMACKING HOW LOW LEVEL THE KIND OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WOMEN WHAT A WOMAN IN POLITICS ACTUALLY MEANS AND I DON'T THINK
THERESA MAY OR ANDREW LEADS HIM WOULD PARTICULARLY WOMEN'S INTERESTS OR MASS SO YOU KNOW LET'S NOT GET OVER EXCITED BUT YES I THINK IF WE CAN AVOID IF WE CAN LIVE ANYWHERE WE DON'T WANT WOMEN TO HAVE TO TO ALL SHOUT FROM THIS AT THE SAME SUMMARY DO HIS OWN EVEN IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THOUGH WE'RE LEAVING AT THEIR ZOE WILLIAMS AS IT HAPPENS WE HAD TWO WOMEN EDITORS THIS MORNING LOUISE LEWIS AND LAURA COOPER FROM ALL OF US A VERY GOOD MORNING

THERE'S A DANGER HERE THAT WE THAT WE SLIP INTO A MINDSET OF REGARDING THE PEOPLE WHO LEAD COUNTRIES ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN EUROPE AS OUR ENEMIES THEY ARE NOT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER NEEDS TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S A MARK OF A DECENT SOCIETY THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE E.U.
