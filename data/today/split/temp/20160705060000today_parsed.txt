# THE TIME IS NOW COMING UP TO TEN MINUTES PAST SIX AND M.P.S ON THE COMMONS DEFENCE SELECT COMMITTEE SAY BRITAIN SHOULD BE DOING MORE MILITARILY AND DIPLOMATICALLY TO REIN IN RUSSIA
JONATHAN BE A LOT HE'S A DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT AND JONATHAN THIS OTHER COMMAS OFFENCE LIKE ME WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING SHOULD BE DONE
TO BE HONEST A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING SHOULD BE DONE IS GOING TO BE DONE AT THE NATO SUMMIT SUCH AS PUTTING IN MORE TROOPS ON NATO'S EASTERN BORDER WE KNOW THAT ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND NATO TROOPS WILL BE
PUT IN TO THOSE COUNTRIES LIKE THE BALTIC STATES AND POLAND ON A ROTATIONAL BASIS THAT WILL INCLUDE PROBABLY AROUND FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED BRITISH TROOPS IN THIS STONY THAT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED AT THE NATO SUMMIT WHOM ALSO THIS WEEKEND ALSO THEY WANT THE RENEWAL OF THE TRIDENT NUCLEAR DETERRENT AS A SIGNAL TO RUSSIA
THAT BRITAIN IS SERIOUS ABOUT ITS DEFENCES WE KNOW ALSO THAT THERESA MAY IS ARGUING FOR A VOTE VERY SOON THE DEFENCE SECRETARY MICHAEL FALLON WANTS A VOTE VERY SOON BEFORE THE SUMMER RECESS SO SO THAT'S KIND OF HAPPENING TO THEY ALSO WANT DIALOGUE THEY WANT EXPERTISE RENEWED WITHIN THE M.O.D. AND THE FOREIGN OFFICE THEY SAY THAT THAT HAS WITHERED ON THE VINE RUSSIA EXPERTS VERY FEW IN NUMBER
THAT THEY WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HERE IN THE U.K. A NATO BY RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION YOU CREATES A LOT OF THESE THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE COMMITTEE WANTS A DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA TO BE HONEST YOU ARE STRENGTHENING THE MILITARY PRESENCE IN ON RUSSIA'S DOORSTEP ESSENTIALLY AND TALKING ABOUT DIALOGUE I THINK DON'T GO TOGETHER NECESSARILY BUT WHAT WOULD TODAY SET OUT WHAT THEIR PARTICULAR FEARS ARE ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE IS THE THREAT FROM RUSSIA
THE FIRST THREE FEAR IS IS A CONVENTIONAL THREAT WHICH IS THAT RUSSIA IS EXPANDING ITS MILITARY IT'S DOING THESE LARGE SNAP EXERCISES ON NATO'S BORDERS THIS IMPLIES THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT RUSSIA IS GETTING READY FOR A CONFLICT WITH THE WEST THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT RUSSIA IS USING UNCONVENTIONAL ME DENIABLE MEANS TO TO THAT TO RATTLE ESSENTIALLY
NATO MEMBERS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE CYBER ATTACKS WHAT WE SAW IN UKRAINE WITH LITTLE GREEN MEN ANOTHER WOODS SOLDIERS ON THE GROUND TO A RUSSIAN BUT THEY'D TAKEN TO NORRIE THEY WERE RUSSIAN SO THAT THAT I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST FEAR THAT RUSSIA WILL TRY TO DE STABILISE COUNTRIES ON NATO'S BORDERS EVEN COUNTRIES WITHIN NATO AND THEY'VE DOING THIS ESSENTIALLY YOUR COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT
# BECAUSE RUSSIA BELIEVES IT HAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD STAGE AND WANTS TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF JONATHAN BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TIME IS NOW TWELVE MINUTES PAST SIX SOME SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND ARE LIKELY TO BE CLOSED TODAY BECAUSE OF A STRIKE BY MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS RUN ON GEOFFREY'S AS OUR EDUCATION EDITOR WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR THIS STRIKE BREMEN
WHAT IT BOILS DOWN BASICALLY TO MONEY IS GOING ON STRIKE BECAUSE IT'S POINTING AT SPENDING PER PUPIL IN SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND IS GOING TO FALL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY AROUND EIGHT PERCENT BY TWENTY TWENTY
THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS ARGUES THAT'S LEADING TO PRESSURE ON JOBS WITH JOB LOSSES POTENTIALLY ON THE HORIZON FOR TEACHERS AND SON BEGINNING TO HAPPEN AND THAT THAT IS FEEDING THROUGH INTO CLASS SIZES
AND IT'S ALSO WORRIED THAT THERE'S IN THE CONTINUED PUSH TOWARDS HAVING MORE ACADEMY SCHOOLS WHICH CAN SET THEIR OWN PAY AND CONDITIONS THAT THAT IS LEADING TO AN EROSION OF NATIONAL PAYING CONDITIONER NATIONAL NATIONAL PAPER BUT THE THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THE SCHOOL'S BUDGET THIS YEAR IS GOING TO TOTAL FORTY BILLION POUNDS WHICH MEANS THAT IS THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN
CINDY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPARING APPLES AND PEARS THEY'RE MOUNTAIN OF MONEY GOING TO SCHOOLS IS GOING UP BUT SO IS THE NUMBER OF PUPILS ARE GOING TO BE MORE PUPILS IN ENGLAND SCHOOLS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND AT THE SAME TIME SCHOOLS ARE HAVING TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO TEACHERS' PENSIONS AND LIKE MANY EMPLOYERS PLATE PAY HIGHER NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THAT MEANS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PER CHILD SITTING IN A CLASSROOM
